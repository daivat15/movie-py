- Yeah.

465
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:39,038
What station? I listen to the radio.
I must have heard you.

466

Shit. WYLD.

- Fuck you.
- [Chuckles]

471
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:59,892
Ah, I can't believe it.
I got a deejay in here with me?

472
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,894
I think that's unbelievable, man.

473
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:05,022
Why don't you do, like,
a little, you know...

474
00:42:05,107 --> 00:42:07,358
a thing, you know, a talk?

475
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:10,611
[Scoffs]
I don't feel like it.

476
00:42:10,696 --> 00:42:14,573
[Clicks Tongue] Come on, man. Do...
You know, do the weather or something.

477
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,956
[Sighs] Man, what's it like outside?
Why don't you tell me that?

478
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,541

Tell me some stuff, you know.
Go ahead. Do a thing.

00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:28,629
Come on.
[Makes Noise]

481
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:32,675
All right. Okay.

482
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:35,386
All right.

483
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:41,726
Let's see, um...

Okay.

Well, we got about 12 below
the big red line.

486
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:52,236
Slick, icy road conditions
out there tonight, Bob. You betcha.

487
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,947
All you holiday travelers beware.

488
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:59,368
Looks like we got about a four-car pileup
out there on the airline highway.

489
00:42:59,453 --> 00:43:01,434
I'm gonna switch over
to our mobile unit now.

490
00:43:01,435 --> 00:43:03,414
Chip, what does it look
like out there to you?

491
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:06,000

492
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,626

501
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:39,200
We're goin' around and around with the big
sound from the big town right here on WYLD.

502
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:42,787
You got the Lee Baby.

Right now we're gonna talk to Jack Romano.

504
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:48,000
We got him right here
in the studio with us.

505
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:52,129
He's working over there
at Tipitina's tonight.

506
00:43:52,214 --> 00:43:54,590
I'm gonna be down there.

509
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:06,393
I wanna send this one out

Dwight, Tyrone and the Golden Boys.

513
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:21,617
Let's hear a little somethin'

514
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:24,620

It's like pulling teeth tryin' to get you
to talk, and you're a fuckin' deejay.

518
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:34,880
- What is wrong with you anyways?
- [Chuckling]

519

Stop it!

521
00:45:12,294 --> 00:45:14,879
Man, don't you know you're makin' time

He don't even speak no English.

534
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:06,430
Homicidal son of a bitch says he's Italian.

[Clears Throat]
If looks can kill, I am dead now.

Excuse me. Excuse me.

Excuse me.

545
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:08,362
Not enough room to swing a cat.

[Chuckles]

547
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:13,158

But do you have some cigarette?

561
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:07,963
Cigarettes won't help with hiccups.
Not in this country.

562
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:12,176
[Hiccups]

585
00:51:43,059 --> 00:51:46,144
Nothing. I said,
"Do you like Walt Whitman?"

Walt Whitman?

587

Yes. I like Walt Whitman very much.

Huh?

601
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:41,259
That's good, Bob.

602
00:53:43,304 --> 00:53:47,432
Excuse me. Do you say in English,
"I looka at the window"...

603
00:53:47,517 --> 00:53:51,853
or do you say in English,
"I looka out the window"?

604
00:53:51,938 --> 00:53:55,816
Well, in this case, Bob, I'm afraid
you gotta say, "I look at the window."

Jack, why-why are you put in this place?

00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,682
I don't know, Bob. It was, like,
voodoo or something, you know?

608
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:35,021
I was framed. I'm completely innocent.

And you, my friend, Zack,
why are you put in this prison?

612
00:54:48,661 --> 00:54:50,662

Me? I killed "hay" man.

You killed a man, huh?

620
00:55:49,597 --> 00:55:51,848
What'd you do that for, Bob?

01:36:31,536 --> 01:36:34,538
So, but you are sure you must leave today?

1094
01:36:34,623 --> 01:36:39,293
Why we cannot stay here
for some times first?

1095
01:36:40,087 --> 01:36:42,505
Well, it's too dangerous out there, Bob.

1096
01:36:42,589 --> 01:36:44,966
There's probably an A.P.B.
out on all of us.

1097
01:36:45,050 --> 01:36:47,718
Nah, I'm sure we're gonna make it.

1098
01:36:48,261 --> 01:36:52,098
Well, we're gonna have to keep going.

1099
01:36:54,601 --> 01:36:56,936
At least now we know where we are.

1100
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:59,146
And where do you go now?

1101
01:36:59,231 --> 01:37:02,108
- I'll probably head out west.
- Hmm.

1102
01:37:02,192 --> 01:37:03,901
Out to Los Angeles.

1103
01:37:06,071 --> 01:37:09,156
And you, my friend, Jack? Where do you go?

1104
01:37:09,241 --> 01:37:13,202
Well, if he's going to L.A.,
I'm gonna go east. You know what I mean?

1105
01:37:13,286 --> 01:37:14,829
- Yes. [Mumbles]
- Yes.

1106
01:37:21,169 --> 01:37:23,462
Some music, yeah?

1107

1111

1112
01:37:57,289 --> 01:38:00,666

If you follow this road...

1134
01:39:37,347 --> 01:39:40,891
you will come to a place
where it becomes two roads.

1135
01:39:41,893 --> 01:39:47,022
On the right will go east.
On the left will go west.

1136
01:39:47,607 --> 01:39:52,236
Uh, no. On the right will go west.

1137
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:57,449
Uh, no. I'm not sure.
Anyway, there is a sign to tell you.

1138
01:39:57,534 --> 01:40:00,703
- It's all right. We'll figure it out.
- It's okay?

1139
01:40:00,787 --> 01:40:02,872
Thanks for everything.

1140
01:40:02,956 --> 01:40:05,166
- Yeah. Thank you. Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

1141
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:07,501
- Zack.
- And, uh, take care.

1142
01:40:07,586 --> 01:40:08,919
- Yeah.
- Okay, Bob.

1143
01:40:09,004 --> 01:40:10,671
- I will.
- Bye.

1144
01:40:10,755 --> 01:40:12,673

Bye.

1147
01:40:18,013 --> 01:40:20,181
- Be careful.
- Okay.

1148
01:40:33,653 --> 01:40:37,364
- Don't forget to write.
- [Zack Laughs]

1149
01:40:38,450 --> 01:40:40,868
- Bye.
- [Nicoletta] So long.

1150
01:40:48,210 --> 01:40:50,711
Wish you were here.

[Exhales]

1152
01:41:51,481 --> 01:41:54,525
- Well, I guess this is it.
- Yeah.

1153
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:58,112
I don't see the sign around or anything.

1154
01:41:58,196 --> 01:42:01,490
Well, she said the one
to the right goes west.

1155
01:42:01,574 --> 01:42:03,492
She said she didn't know.

1156
01:42:03,576 --> 01:42:05,494
Look, man, don't matter to me.

1157
01:42:05,578 --> 01:42:09,248
You go whichever way you want, right?
And I'll go the other way.

1158
01:42:09,332 --> 01:42:10,541
- Yeah, right.
- All right?

1159
01:42:10,625 --> 01:42:11,834
Fine.

1160
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:19,758
So, uh...

1161
01:42:21,261 --> 01:42:24,096
this is how you dressed
before you were in the joint, right?

1162
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:27,474
Sort of garbageman on parade.

1163
01:42:27,559 --> 01:42:29,560
- Huh.
- [Chuckles]

1164
01:42:30,353 --> 01:42:34,023
You, uh, plannin' on doin'
a little squirrel huntin', Jack?

1165

Yeah.

1166
01:42:56,129 --> 01:42:57,629
Okay.

1167
01:43:04,012 --> 01:43:05,512
