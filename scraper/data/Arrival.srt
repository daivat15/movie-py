In 1770,

Captain James Cook's ship ran aground

512

off the coast of Australia,

513
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,472
and he led a party into the country,

514
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,198
and they met the Aboriginal people.

515
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,759
One of the sailors pointed at

516
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,598
the animals that hop around

517
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,398
and put their babies in their pouch,

518
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,152
and he asked what they were,

519
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,356
and the Aborigine said, "Kangaroo."

520
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,434
And the point is?

00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,296
<font color="#404040"><font color="#404040">LOUISE:</font></font> It wasn't till later

"kangaroo" means
"I don't understand." So,

And remember what happened
to the Aborigines.

do they make conscious choices?

Or is their motivation so instinctive

577

that they don't understand
a "why" question at all?

we don't know about heptapods.

00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,111
Greek. Hepta, "Seven. " Pod, "Foot."

698

Seven feet. Heptapod.

Who are they?

700
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,753
Trying to answer this
in any meaningful way

701
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,598
is hampered by the fact that,

702
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,598
outside being able to see them
and hear them,

703
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,757
the heptapods leave
absolutely no footprint.

704
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,029
The chemical composition of
their spaceship is unknown.

705
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,351
The shell emits no waste,
no gas, no radiation.

706
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,671
Assuming that the shells
communicate with each other,

707
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,354
they do so without detection.

708
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,954
The air between the shells is untroubled

709
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,991
by sonic emission or light wave.

710
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,034
Are they scientists? Or tourists?

711
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,519
If they're scientists,

712
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,909
they don't seem to ask a lot of questions.

713
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,269
Why did they park where they did?

714
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,870
The world's most decorated
experts can't crack that one.

715
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,552
The most plausible theory is

716
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,119
that they chose places on Earth

717
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,708
with the lowest incidence
of lightning strikes.

718
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,791
But there are exceptions.

719
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,871
The next most plausible theory is that

720
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,552
Sheena Easton had a hit song

721
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,153
at each of these sites in 1980.

722
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,878
So, we just don't know.

723
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,869
How do they communicate?

724
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,072
Here, Louise is putting us all to shame.

725
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,832
The first breakthrough was

726
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,480
to discover that there's no correlation

727
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:06,309
between what a heptapod says
and what a heptapod writes.

728
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,595
Unlike all written human languages,

729
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,194
their writing is semasiographic.

730
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,750
It conveys meaning.
It doesn't represent sound.

731
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,390
Perhaps they view our form of writing

732
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,789
as a wasted opportunity,

733
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,480
passing up a second
communications channel.

734
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,438
We have our friends in Pakistan to thank

735
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,512
for their study of how heptapods write,

736
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,553
because unlike speech,
a logogram is free of time.

737
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,471
Like their ship or their bodies,

738
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,915
their written language has no forward

739
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,353
or backward direction.

740
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,319
Linguists call this
non-linear orthography,

741
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,790
which raises the question,
"Is this how they think?"

742
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,751
Imagine you wanted to write
a sentence using two hands,

743
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,398
starting from either side.

744
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,631
You would have to know
each word you wanted to use,

745
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,518
as well as how much space
they would occupy.

746
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,796
A heptapod can write
a complex sentence

747
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,996
in two seconds, effortlessly.

748
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,958
It's taken us a month

at the Shanghai site.

In a televised statement,

1091

General Shang, chairman of
the People's Liberation Army,

1092

said the aliens have 24 hours

to unite with China
and take a similar stance.

With a huge buildup of forces
at their landing sites,

How much of it is negative space?
