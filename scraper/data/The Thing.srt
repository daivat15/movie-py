1
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:20,862
Your move: bishop to knight four.

2
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,127
My move: knight to rook three.

3
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,135
Poor baby, you're startin'
to lose it, aren't you?

4
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,143
Your move: king to rook one.

5
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:39,307
My move: rook to knight six.

6
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:43,113
Checkmate. Checkmate.

7
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:49,153
You cheatin' bitch.

8
00:06:52,456 --> 00:06:55,220
Childs, what's he doin'?

9
00:06:55,293 --> 00:06:57,488
Circling the camp.

10
00:06:57,562 --> 00:06:59,496
Who is he?

11
00:06:59,564 --> 00:07:02,931
Said "Norge" or something
on the side. It's Norwegian.

12
00:09:07,594 --> 00:09:09,528
George, are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

13
00:09:09,596 --> 00:09:11,530
Are you? Yeah. What's going on there?

14
00:09:34,022 --> 00:09:35,956
Watch it.

15
00:09:56,044 --> 00:09:57,978
Easy.

16
00:10:00,715 --> 00:10:05,311
Easy, easy, easy. Yes.

17
00:10:17,566 --> 00:10:20,501
First goddamn week of winter.

18
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:35,112
Oh, come on. Four stitches. Barely grazed ya.

19
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:38,017
What were they doin' flyin' that low,

20
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:40,180
shooting at a dog, at us?

21
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:42,656
Mmm, stir-crazy.

22
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,125
Cabin fever. Who knows?

23
00:10:45,194 --> 00:10:49,358
U.S. Number 31, calling
McMurdo. Come in. Over.

24
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,035
U.S. Number 31, calling McMurdo.

25
00:10:54,104 --> 00:10:56,038
Urgent. Come in. Over.

26
00:10:56,106 --> 00:10:59,769
Great.

27
00:10:59,843 --> 00:11:02,334
Come on, come on. Nobody!

28
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,346
Nobody. Get a hold of somebody.

29
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,473
Get a hold of anybody.
We gotta report this mess.

30
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,077
Look, I haven't been able
to reach shit in two weeks.

31
00:11:10,153 --> 00:11:13,145
I doubt if anybody's talked to
anybody on this entire continent,

32
00:11:13,223 --> 00:11:16,989
and you want me to reach somebody!

33
00:11:26,303 --> 00:11:29,033
Maybe we're at war with Norway.

34
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:35,844
I was wonderin' when the El Capitan...

35
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:38,575
was gonna get a chance to use his popgun.

36
00:11:42,653 --> 00:11:46,145
How long've they been stationed
there? It says here only eight weeks.

37
00:11:46,224 --> 00:11:49,159
Well, that's not long enough for
guys to go bonkers. Bullshit, bwana.

38
00:11:49,227 --> 00:11:52,685
Five minutes is enough to put a
man over down here. Damn straight.

39
00:11:52,763 --> 00:11:56,995
I mean, look at Palmer. He been
the way he is since the first day.

40
00:11:57,068 --> 00:11:59,002
How many in their party?

41
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,631
They started with ten. There'd be
eight others left. How do we know?

42
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:04,641
Guys as crazy as that could have done...

43
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:06,734
a lot of damage to their
own before they got to us.

44
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:09,302
Nothing we can do about that.
Yes there is. I wanna go up.

45
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,314
In this weather? Bennings?

46
00:12:11,382 --> 00:12:13,714
Winds are gonna let up a
tad next couple of hours.

47
00:12:13,784 --> 00:12:15,718
A tad?

48
00:12:15,786 --> 00:12:17,720
Can't condone it much myself,

49
00:12:17,788 --> 00:12:19,881
but it is a short haul.

50
00:12:19,957 --> 00:12:22,791
An hour there, an hour back.

51
00:12:22,861 --> 00:12:26,228
Shit, Doc, I'll give
you the lift. No problem.

52
00:12:26,298 --> 00:12:30,359
Forget it, Palmer. Hey, thanks
for thinking about it though.

53
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:36,764
Loaded with kerosene. I count 15 cans.

54
00:12:36,842 --> 00:12:40,073
MacReady! Mac, get your gear on!

55
00:12:51,323 --> 00:12:53,257
Mac, it may not clear up for a week. Yeah.

56
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:55,691
We're the closest ones to
'em. It's all right by me, Doc.

57
00:12:55,761 --> 00:12:59,959
I'm just lettin' you know we're takin'
a chance. Quit the griping, MacReady.

58
00:13:00,032 --> 00:13:02,466
Those clouds keep movin' over the
sun, we're gonna get a whiteout.

59
00:13:02,534 --> 00:13:05,401
We get caught in that, you can
scratch one doctor and one pilot.

60
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,134
This is real thin. It'll
clear as soon as you get up.

61
00:13:10,643 --> 00:13:14,079
It's up to you, Mac. If you
don't wanna fly, we don't fly.

62
00:13:15,648 --> 00:13:18,242
You really wanna save those
crazy Swedes, huh? Norwegians.

63
00:13:18,318 --> 00:13:20,252
Which way, Doc? Southwest.

64
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,584
You're gonna have to read the map.

65
00:13:29,929 --> 00:13:34,229
Mac's really taking it up, huh?

66
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,234
He knows what he's doin'.

67
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:40,326
Nauls, will you turn that crap down?

68
00:14:40,402 --> 00:14:43,303
I'm trying to get some
sleep. I was shot today.

69
00:14:44,506 --> 00:14:46,440
Read, bwana. Will do.

70
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,445
#Writing's on the wall #

71
00:14:53,314 --> 00:14:56,806
#Very superstitious #

72
00:17:12,023 --> 00:17:14,958
Anybody there?

73
00:17:15,026 --> 00:17:19,622
Hey, Sweden! They're not
Swedish, Mac. They're Norwegian.

74
00:18:42,515 --> 00:18:44,915
Mac!

75
00:19:19,586 --> 00:19:22,987
My God. What the hell happened here?

76
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:27,687
Come on, Doc.

77
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,269
- Portable video unit. Anything?
- It's all in Norwegian.

78
00:20:15,343 --> 00:20:17,277
What are you doin', Doc?

79
00:20:17,345 --> 00:20:19,870
Could be important work.
I wanna take it back.

80
00:20:19,948 --> 00:20:22,883
Well, it's gettin' late. Let's hurry it up.

81
00:20:22,951 --> 00:20:25,044
I'll check out the last few rooms.

82
00:20:43,472 --> 00:20:46,964
Hey, Copper, come here!

83
00:21:28,552 --> 00:21:30,486
Maybe they found a fossil,

84
00:21:30,554 --> 00:21:33,352
the remains of some animal buried
in the ice, and they chopped it out.

85
00:21:33,423 --> 00:21:35,687
But where is it? Look at this.

86
00:21:50,273 --> 00:21:52,969
What is that?

87
00:21:53,043 --> 00:21:55,978
Is that a man in there or something?

88
00:21:57,547 --> 00:22:00,482
Whatever it is, they burned it up in a hurry.

89
00:22:02,887 --> 00:22:05,720
Help me find a shovel, Doc.

90
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,047
We found this.

91
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,049
Jesus Christ.

92
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:34,073
Blair, I'd like you to
start an autopsy right away.

93
00:24:35,075 --> 00:24:37,839
Did you reach anybody yet? Reach anybody?

94
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:40,175
We're a thousand miles from nowhere, man,

95
00:24:40,247 --> 00:24:42,681
and it's gonna get worse
before it gets better.

96
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,685
Well, stick to it, Windows. Stick to it.

97
00:24:50,891 --> 00:24:54,019
Nothin' wrong with this
Norwegian, physiologically anyway.

98
00:24:54,094 --> 00:24:57,029
No drugs, no alcohol. Nothing.

99
00:24:58,766 --> 00:25:00,700
Hmm?

100
00:25:19,988 --> 00:25:23,754
Well, what we got here is
what appears to be, anyway,

101
00:25:23,825 --> 00:25:26,259
a normal set of internal organs.

102
00:25:27,662 --> 00:25:31,496
Heart, lungs,

103
00:25:31,566 --> 00:25:33,557
kidneys, liver.

104
00:25:33,635 --> 00:25:35,569
Intestines.

105
00:25:39,474 --> 00:25:41,499
Seem to be normal.

106
00:25:58,961 --> 00:26:02,522
One, door number
two and door number three.

107
00:26:02,598 --> 00:26:05,863
And I think that Dawn Screen here
has got the one to trade in the most.

108
00:26:05,935 --> 00:26:07,960
I went to you first. You
brought your friend Anna.

109
00:26:08,037 --> 00:26:10,130
You've been consulting Anna
all through the show anyhow.

110
00:26:10,206 --> 00:26:13,698
You may as well consult her one
more time. I know how this one ends.

111
00:26:48,879 --> 00:26:52,781
Clark, will you put this mutt
with the others where he belongs?

112
00:26:56,253 --> 00:26:58,187
Yeah, okay.

113
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:19,809
Go ahead.

114
00:27:23,381 --> 00:27:26,179
Go ahead. What are you waiting for?

115
00:30:17,425 --> 00:30:19,359
I don't know what the hell's in there,

116
00:30:19,427 --> 00:30:22,362
but it's weird and pissed off,
whatever it is. Bennings, go get Childs.

117
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,864
What is this? What's goin' on?

118
00:30:24,933 --> 00:30:27,458
Hey, Palmer, what is this? I don't know.

119
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:30,629
Childs, Mac wants the
flamethrower! Mac wants the what?

120
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:33,674
That's what he said. Now, move! Damn it.

121
00:30:46,488 --> 00:30:48,752
- Stay back.
- Hey, Mac, what is it?

122
00:31:36,505 --> 00:31:41,033
- Don't! No!
- Get away! Get back! Get back!

123
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,404
Get your ass over here!

124
00:32:09,906 --> 00:32:11,840
Burn it.

125
00:32:15,245 --> 00:32:17,179
Damn it, Childs. Torch it!

126
00:33:39,097 --> 00:33:41,031
Oh, my God.

127
00:33:47,406 --> 00:33:49,340
Oh!

128
00:33:49,408 --> 00:33:52,206
Oh!

129
00:33:56,348 --> 00:33:59,284
Look. Son of a bitch. Oh.

130
00:34:16,035 --> 00:34:17,798
You see, what we're talking about here...

131
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,361
is an organism that
imitates other life-forms,

132
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,374
and it imitates 'em perfectly.

133
00:34:22,442 --> 00:34:25,878
When this Thing attacked our
dogs, it tried to digest 'em,

134
00:34:25,945 --> 00:34:28,004
absorb them,

135
00:34:28,081 --> 00:34:32,017
and in the process, shape
its own cells to imitate them.

136
00:34:34,087 --> 00:34:38,547
This, for instance... That's not dog.

137
00:34:39,892 --> 00:34:41,826
It's imitation.

138
00:34:41,894 --> 00:34:45,331
We got to it before it had time to finish.

139
00:34:46,533 --> 00:34:48,694
Finish what?

140
00:34:48,769 --> 00:34:51,203
Finish imitating these dogs.

141
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:02,346
Easy, easy. Good.

142
00:35:04,918 --> 00:35:06,852
Easy, easy.

143
00:35:11,892 --> 00:35:13,826
Clark. Yeah?

144
00:35:13,894 --> 00:35:17,489
Did you notice anything strange
about the dog, anything at all?

145
00:35:17,564 --> 00:35:19,623
Strange? No.

146
00:35:21,402 --> 00:35:23,597
What was the dog doin' in the rec room?

147
00:35:23,671 --> 00:35:25,662
I don't know.

148
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:28,436
He was just wandering around camp all day.

149
00:35:30,745 --> 00:35:34,806
Are you sayin'to me the dog wasn't
put in the kennel until last night?

150
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:36,612
Right.

151
00:35:38,253 --> 00:35:40,312
How long were you alone with that dog?

152
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:45,325
I don't know. An hour.
Hour and a half, maybe.

153
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:49,830
What the hell you lookin'
at me like that for?

154
00:35:52,334 --> 00:35:54,268
I don't know. What?

155
00:35:55,603 --> 00:35:58,538
I don't know. It's probably nothin'.

156
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:01,875
It's nothin'at all.

157
00:36:13,122 --> 00:36:15,056
How much more of this crap is there?

158
00:36:15,124 --> 00:36:17,558
Oh, about nine hours, I'd say.

159
00:36:18,728 --> 00:36:20,821
We can't learn anything from this.

160
00:36:20,896 --> 00:36:22,830
Guess not.

161
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:35,043
Where'd they take these shots?

162
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:38,546
Seems like they were spendin'
a lot of their time...

163
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:41,344
in a little place northeast of
their camp about five or six miles.

164
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:43,851
What's that?

165
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:47,855
It looks like
somethin' buried under the ice.

166
00:36:53,429 --> 00:36:56,866
And look at that. They're
planting thermite charges.

167
00:36:56,933 --> 00:37:00,869
Whatever it was, it was bigger
than that block of ice you found.

168
00:37:09,846 --> 00:37:12,781
Here. This is it.

169
00:37:12,849 --> 00:37:15,147
The place where they were spendin' most
of their time. Pretty nasty out, Mac.

170
00:37:15,218 --> 00:37:17,152
Thirty-five knots. Screw
it. I'm gonna go up anyway.

171
00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:43,446
Half a mile due east.

172
00:39:21,714 --> 00:39:25,775
Jesus, how long do you figure
this has been in the ice?

173
00:39:25,852 --> 00:39:29,788
Well, the backscatter effect's
been bringin' things up...

174
00:39:29,856 --> 00:39:32,654
from way down around here for a long time.

175
00:39:32,725 --> 00:39:37,560
I'd say... I'd say the ice it's buried
in is 100,000 years old, at least.

176
00:39:40,466 --> 00:39:43,094
And those Norwegians blew it up? Yeah.

177
00:40:11,799 --> 00:40:13,733
I don't know.

178
00:40:13,801 --> 00:40:16,031
Thousands of years ago, it crashes,

179
00:40:16,103 --> 00:40:18,367
and this Thing...

180
00:40:18,439 --> 00:40:22,034
gets thrown out or crawls out,
and it ends up freezing in the ice.

181
00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:26,068
I just cannot believe any
of this voodoo bullshit.

182
00:40:26,146 --> 00:40:29,377
Childs, it happens all the time, man.

183
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:32,112
They're fallin' outta the skies like flies.

184
00:40:32,186 --> 00:40:34,450
Government knows all about it. Right, Mac?

185
00:40:34,521 --> 00:40:37,285
Do you believe any of this
voodoo bullshit, Blair?

186
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:42,296
Childs. Childs. Chariots Of The Gods, man.

187
00:40:42,364 --> 00:40:44,525
They practically own South America.

188
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:47,033
I mean, they taught the
Incas everything they know.

189
00:40:54,809 --> 00:40:56,743
Come on, now, MacReady.

190
00:40:56,811 --> 00:40:59,837
The Norwegians get a hold of this,
and they dig it up out of the ice.

191
00:40:59,914 --> 00:41:02,280
Yes, Garry, they dig it
up. They cart it back.

192
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:05,911
It gets thawed out, wakes
up, not in the best of moods.

193
00:41:05,987 --> 00:41:08,683
I don't know. I wasn't there. Which
one of you disrespectful men...

194
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:12,249
been tossin' his dirty drawers
in the kitchen trash can, huh?

195
00:41:12,327 --> 00:41:15,819
From now on I want my
kitchen clean, germfree.

196
00:41:15,897 --> 00:41:19,025
Now how's this motherfucker wake up
after thousands of years in the ice?

197
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:22,035
And how could it look like
a dog? I don't know how.

198
00:41:22,103 --> 00:41:24,037
'Cause it's different than us, see?

199
00:41:24,105 --> 00:41:27,701
'Cause it's from outer space.
What do you want from me? Ask him.

200
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,005
You buy any of this, Blair?

201
00:43:35,606 --> 00:43:37,540
Mac,
removin' those things...

202
00:43:37,608 --> 00:43:39,543
out of the lab into the storeroom.

203
00:43:39,611 --> 00:43:42,205
Can you come get your stuff?

204
00:43:42,281 --> 00:43:44,215
Be there in a minute, Doc.

205
00:44:01,633 --> 00:44:03,567
Through the door.

206
00:44:06,905 --> 00:44:08,839
Right over here. Right over...

207
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:15,176
Sorry, Mac. You have to move your stuff ou...

208
00:44:15,247 --> 00:44:18,512
Doc says we gotta lock him up.
Stash him in here and lock him up.

209
00:44:18,584 --> 00:44:21,519
I have to talk to you. I'm
tired of talkin', Fuchs.

210
00:44:21,587 --> 00:44:23,521
I just wanna get up to
my shack and get drunk.

211
00:44:23,589 --> 00:44:27,026
Mac, it's important. What is it?

212
00:44:27,093 --> 00:44:29,687
Outside. It's 40 below outside.

213
00:44:29,762 --> 00:44:33,198
In the Thiokol. Please, Mac.

214
00:44:47,247 --> 00:44:49,738
We ought to just burn these things.

215
00:44:49,816 --> 00:44:52,546
Can't burn the find of the century.

216
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:55,747
That's gonna win somebody the Nobel Prize.

217
00:45:08,301 --> 00:45:10,236
You, uh, got the keys?

218
00:45:10,304 --> 00:45:13,740
Get 'em from Garry. I wanna
get some stuff outta here.

219
00:45:47,775 --> 00:45:49,709
There's something wrong with Blair.

220
00:45:49,777 --> 00:45:52,109
He's locked himself in his room,
and he won't answer the door.

221
00:45:52,179 --> 00:45:55,946
So I took one of his
notebooks from the lab. Yeah?

222
00:45:56,017 --> 00:45:58,645
Listen.

223
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,814
"It could have imitated a million
life-forms on a million planets.

224
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:04,154
"Could change into any
one of them at any time.

225
00:46:04,225 --> 00:46:06,159
Now it wants life-forms on Earth. "

226
00:46:06,227 --> 00:46:08,161
It's gettin' cold in here,
and I haven't slept in days.

227
00:46:08,229 --> 00:46:10,163
Wait. "It needs to be alone...

228
00:46:10,231 --> 00:46:12,961
"and in close proximity with
a life-form to be absorbed.

229
00:46:13,034 --> 00:46:14,968
The chameleon strikes in the dark. "

230
00:46:15,036 --> 00:46:16,970
So is Blair cracking up,
or what? Damn it, MacReady.

231
00:46:17,038 --> 00:46:19,632
"There is still cellular
activity in these burned remains.

232
00:46:19,708 --> 00:46:21,642
They're not dead yet. "

233
00:46:32,954 --> 00:46:34,888
Let's go, Bennings. I gotta get some sleep.

234
00:46:54,543 --> 00:46:57,478
Holy shit.

235
00:47:01,984 --> 00:47:04,919
Go get the doc.

236
00:47:04,987 --> 00:47:07,421
I'll get Garry. We'll meet in Blair's room.

237
00:47:13,162 --> 00:47:15,096
It's Bennings!

238
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:29,645
Bennings was right there. Mac, I
swear to God. It had a hold of him.

239
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:45,494
Windows!
Windows! Keep away from him!

240
00:47:47,697 --> 00:47:49,631
Get back! Stay back!

241
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:54,870
It isn't Bennings.

242
00:48:28,506 --> 00:48:30,440
My God, what was happening to him?

243
00:48:30,508 --> 00:48:34,103
If it had more time it would have
looked, sounded and acted like Bennings.

244
00:48:34,178 --> 00:48:36,271
I don't know what you're saying.

245
00:48:36,347 --> 00:48:40,681
That was one of those Things out
there trying to imitate him, Garry.

246
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:47,517
- Come on.
- MacReady, I know Bennings. I've known him for ten years.

247
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:49,526
He's my friend.

248
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:52,223
We've gotta burn the rest of'em.

249
00:49:26,198 --> 00:49:28,132
All right, step back.

250
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,794
You sure that's all of'em?

251
00:49:55,862 --> 00:50:00,458
We cleaned out the storehouse,
the lab. There is nothin' left.

252
00:50:00,533 --> 00:50:02,467
Where's Blair?

253
00:50:43,744 --> 00:50:46,474
I can't find Blair.

254
00:50:46,547 --> 00:50:48,674
Where's everybody else?

255
00:50:48,749 --> 00:50:53,413
Windows is in the radio room still trying to
get through. Everyone else, in the rec room.

256
00:50:53,487 --> 00:50:56,149
Well, you go on. I'll be in in a minute.

257
00:51:19,047 --> 00:51:20,981
Blair?

258
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:24,084
Blair?

259
00:52:21,744 --> 00:52:25,441
Don't! You son of
a bitch. You understand me?

260
00:52:25,514 --> 00:52:28,574
- He's got a gun. Get back.
- Anybody interferes, I'll kill 'em.

261
00:52:28,651 --> 00:52:31,085
- Jesus.
- Just leave it here. We're gonna talk.

262
00:52:31,153 --> 00:52:33,087
He smashed up some of
the chopper pretty good.

263
00:52:33,155 --> 00:52:35,089
Nobody talk to nobody!

264
00:52:35,157 --> 00:52:38,150
Childs, go see if he got
to the tractor.

265
00:52:38,228 --> 00:52:40,788
Nobody gets in and outta here. Nobody.

266
00:52:47,437 --> 00:52:52,033
You guys think I'm crazy. Well, that's fine.

267
00:52:52,109 --> 00:52:55,545
Most of you don't know
what's goin' on around here.

268
00:52:55,612 --> 00:53:00,106
Well, I'm damn well sure some of you do.

269
00:53:00,183 --> 00:53:02,117
Christ.

270
00:53:05,188 --> 00:53:09,056
He got most of the chopper and the tractor,
and he's killed the rest of the dogs.

271
00:53:12,696 --> 00:53:15,631
Garry, wait a minute, wait a minute.

272
00:53:15,699 --> 00:53:19,635
Now, Childs, go around to the
map room door. Talk to him.

273
00:53:19,703 --> 00:53:21,638
Okay.

274
00:53:21,706 --> 00:53:24,903
Norris, get a table from the lab.

275
00:53:26,544 --> 00:53:30,810
Do you think that Thing
wanted to be an animal?

276
00:53:30,882 --> 00:53:34,010
No dogs make it a thousand
miles through the cold.

277
00:53:36,921 --> 00:53:40,322
Nah, you don't understand!

278
00:53:40,391 --> 00:53:42,359
That Thing wanted to be us.

279
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:45,863
If the cell gets out...

280
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:47,898
it could imitate everything
on the face of the earth...

281
00:53:47,965 --> 00:53:50,525
and it's not gonna stop! Okay, Blair.

282
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:54,037
Come on, man, you don't wanna hurt anybody.

283
00:53:54,972 --> 00:53:57,167
I'll kill you.

284
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,034
Good shot, MacReady.

285
00:54:24,102 --> 00:54:26,036
Excuse me. Okay.

286
00:54:26,104 --> 00:54:28,038
All right, bring him up. Yeah.

287
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,095
Come on, Blair.

288
00:54:55,635 --> 00:55:00,129
What about your shack? I don't want him in
my shack. We'll lock him in the toolshed.

289
00:55:05,144 --> 00:55:08,739
Why am I in here? For
your own protection, Blair.

290
00:55:23,062 --> 00:55:25,121
How you doin', old boy?

291
00:55:29,135 --> 00:55:31,899
I don't know who to trust.

292
00:55:31,971 --> 00:55:35,738
I know
what you mean, Blair.

293
00:55:35,809 --> 00:55:38,972
Trust's a tough thing to come by these days.

294
00:55:39,046 --> 00:55:41,810
Tell you what.

295
00:55:41,882 --> 00:55:44,942
Why don't you just trust in the Lord?

296
00:55:47,087 --> 00:55:50,386
Watch Clark. What?

297
00:55:51,325 --> 00:55:55,091
I said, watch Clark.

298
00:55:55,162 --> 00:55:58,131
And watch him close. Do you hear me?

299
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:18,175
And now the radio's gone.

300
00:56:18,252 --> 00:56:21,279
And so are the choppers.
We're completely cut off.

301
00:56:21,356 --> 00:56:25,122
All we can do now is hole up 'til
spring, wait for the rescue team.

302
00:56:25,193 --> 00:56:29,323
No, we don't wait. Somebody in this
camp ain't what he appears to be.

303
00:56:29,397 --> 00:56:33,356
Right now that may be one or two of
us. By spring, it could be all of us.

304
00:56:33,435 --> 00:56:36,268
So how do we know who's human?

305
00:56:36,338 --> 00:56:39,239
If I was an imitation...
a perfect imitation...

306
00:56:39,307 --> 00:56:42,970
how would you know if it was really me?

307
00:56:48,016 --> 00:56:50,280
Is there some kind of test, Doc?

308
00:56:50,352 --> 00:56:54,948
Well, yeah, possibly. I've been
thinkin' about a blood serum test.

309
00:56:55,023 --> 00:56:56,820
What's that?

310
00:56:56,891 --> 00:57:01,590
We could take a sample of each person's
blood, mix it with uncontaminated blood.

311
00:57:01,663 --> 00:57:04,929
I suppose if there's a reaction,
we'd know who isn't human.

312
00:57:05,001 --> 00:57:09,028
- We've got whole blood in storage.
- Start working on it.

313
00:57:09,105 --> 00:57:11,039
Keep an eye on Clark.

314
00:57:11,107 --> 00:57:14,076
He was close to that dog.

315
00:57:14,143 --> 00:57:16,338
Yeah. Yeah.

316
00:57:20,716 --> 00:57:23,412
Mac, we need Blair's help.

317
00:57:23,486 --> 00:57:26,819
He's the only one who knows
this organism. He's too far gone.

318
00:57:26,889 --> 00:57:30,825
But get the rest of his
notebooks. Start goin' through 'em.

319
00:57:41,837 --> 00:57:45,238
Garry! Hey, you guys, come here!

320
00:57:47,643 --> 00:57:50,078
What? Somebody got to the blood.

321
00:57:50,147 --> 00:57:52,012
What?

322
00:57:52,082 --> 00:57:54,880
Where's Clark? Right here.

323
00:57:54,951 --> 00:57:58,580
Wait a minute. Was this broken
into? The lock is undamaged.

324
00:57:58,655 --> 00:58:01,522
Somebody opened it, closed it,
then locked it.  Great.

325
00:58:01,591 --> 00:58:04,185
Who's got access to it?

326
00:58:08,732 --> 00:58:11,064
I guess I'm the only one.

327
00:58:11,134 --> 00:58:13,466
And I got the only key.

328
00:58:16,773 --> 00:58:20,174
Would that test have
worked, Doc? I think so, yes.

329
00:58:20,243 --> 00:58:22,473
Somebody else
sure as hell thought so.

330
00:58:22,546 --> 00:58:25,743
Well, who else could've used that key?

331
00:58:25,816 --> 00:58:28,808
Nobody! I just give it to
Copper whenever he needs it.

332
00:58:28,885 --> 00:58:31,479
Could anybody have gotten it from you, Doc?

333
00:58:31,555 --> 00:58:34,992
I don't see how. As soon as I'm
finished, I return it right away.

334
00:58:37,729 --> 00:58:39,663
Great.

335
00:58:39,731 --> 00:58:44,065
When was the last time
you used it?  Day or so ago.

336
00:58:46,003 --> 00:58:49,530
I suppose somebody could have
lifted it off me... Oh, come on!

337
00:58:49,607 --> 00:58:52,940
That key ring of yours is always
hooked to your belt.

338
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:57,879
- Accusing everybody...
-  Stop it! It ain't worth it!

339
00:58:57,949 --> 00:59:00,850
Copper's the only one who's got any
business with it.  Wait a minute!

340
00:59:00,918 --> 00:59:03,944
You've been in here on several
occasions. Doc thought of the test.

341
00:59:04,021 --> 00:59:07,718
So what? Is that
supposed to clear him?

342
00:59:07,792 --> 00:59:08,850
Windows! Windows!

343
00:59:23,041 --> 00:59:24,975
Put that down!

344
00:59:25,043 --> 00:59:28,240
No. I'll put this right through your head.

345
00:59:28,313 --> 00:59:31,339
You guys gonna listen to Garry?

346
00:59:31,416 --> 00:59:34,783
You gonna let him give the orders?
He could be one of those Things.

347
00:59:34,853 --> 00:59:37,481
Windows. Wait a minute.

348
00:59:37,556 --> 00:59:40,525
Just take it easy. Put the gun down.

349
00:59:40,592 --> 00:59:43,493
Put it down. You don't
want to hurt anybody. Right.

350
00:59:43,562 --> 00:59:45,928
On the floor.

351
00:59:59,311 --> 01:00:01,836
It's on the floor.

352
01:00:08,922 --> 01:00:11,755
I don't know about Copper,

353
01:00:11,825 --> 01:00:15,124
but I give you my word, I
did not go near that blood.

354
01:00:22,936 --> 01:00:25,871
But I guess you'll all
feel a little easier...

355
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:30,506
if somebody else was in charge.

356
01:00:30,577 --> 01:00:34,536
Norris, I can't see anybody objecting to you.

357
01:00:38,251 --> 01:00:40,617
I'm sorry, fellas, but I'm not up to it.

358
01:00:40,687 --> 01:00:44,350
I'll take it. Like hell you will.

359
01:00:44,424 --> 01:00:48,088
It should be somebody a little
more even-tempered, Childs.

360
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:00,607
All right.

361
01:01:22,129 --> 01:01:25,860
I know I'm human.

362
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:32,132
And if you were all these Things,
then you'd just attack me right now.

363
01:01:32,206 --> 01:01:34,471
So some of you are still human.

364
01:01:34,542 --> 01:01:39,980
This Thing doesn't want to show itself.
It wants to hide inside an imitation.

365
01:01:41,082 --> 01:01:43,107
It'll fight if it has to.

366
01:01:43,184 --> 01:01:46,585
But it's vulnerable out in the open.

367
01:01:46,655 --> 01:01:50,056
If it takes us over,

368
01:01:50,125 --> 01:01:53,094
then it has no more enemies,

369
01:01:53,161 --> 01:01:55,322
nobody left to kill it.

370
01:01:56,398 --> 01:01:58,332
And then it's won.

371
01:02:01,937 --> 01:02:04,929
There's a storm hitting us in six hours.

372
01:02:05,006 --> 01:02:07,736
We're gonna find out who's who.

373
01:02:07,809 --> 01:02:11,609
All right, Doc, Garry and Clark,
move over there away from the others.

374
01:02:23,559 --> 01:02:28,087
Norris, you and Childs shoot 'em up with morphine.
Tie 'em down in the rec room and watch 'em.

375
01:02:28,164 --> 01:02:30,428
Fuchs, you start working on a
new technique. I need Doc's help.

376
01:02:30,499 --> 01:02:35,664
You don't wanna drug me.
Mac, I'm not a prisoner!

377
01:02:56,592 --> 01:02:59,425
Let-Let me do it. You're gonna
break the needle in my arm.

378
01:02:59,495 --> 01:03:03,091
No, Doc, he's doing a real fine job.

379
01:03:11,174 --> 01:03:14,143
I'm gonna hide this tape when I'm finished.

380
01:03:14,211 --> 01:03:18,443
If none of us make it, at least
there'll be some kind of record.

381
01:03:18,515 --> 01:03:22,679
Storm's been hitting us
hard now for 48 hours.

382
01:03:22,753 --> 01:03:25,119
We still have nothing to go on.

383
01:03:37,034 --> 01:03:40,902
One other thing, I think it
rips through your clothes...

384
01:03:40,971 --> 01:03:43,565
when it takes you over.

385
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:48,544
Windows found some shredded long
johns, but the name tag was missing.

386
01:03:48,613 --> 01:03:50,911
They could be anybody's.

387
01:03:52,383 --> 01:03:54,351
Nobody...

388
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:58,882
Nobody trusts anybody now.

389
01:04:00,258 --> 01:04:03,091
And we're all very tired.

390
01:04:09,467 --> 01:04:11,935
Nobody trusts anybody now.

391
01:04:15,306 --> 01:04:18,503
There's nothing else I can do.

392
01:04:18,576 --> 01:04:20,771
Just wait.

393
01:04:23,714 --> 01:04:27,514
R.J. MacReady, helicopter
pilot, U.S. Outpost, number 31.

394
01:04:42,201 --> 01:04:44,761
You come up with anything yet?

395
01:04:44,837 --> 01:04:47,135
One or two ideas.

396
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:52,642
But, MacReady, I've been thinking.

397
01:04:52,711 --> 01:04:56,841
If a small particle of this Thing is
enough to take over an entire organism,

398
01:04:56,915 --> 01:04:59,383
then everyone should prepare their own meals.

399
01:04:59,451 --> 01:05:01,544
And I suggest we only eat out of cans.

400
01:05:02,754 --> 01:05:04,688
All right.

401
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:39,254
Who's that?

402
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:18,697
Anybody see Fuchs?

403
01:06:21,502 --> 01:06:23,800
Somebody blew out a fuse in the lab.

404
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:27,034
Lights were out for an hour.
Anyone of us could've gotten to him.

405
01:06:27,107 --> 01:06:32,170
All right, we gotta find him. Nauls, why
don't you come with me and we'll look outside.

406
01:06:32,246 --> 01:06:34,510
Palmer, you and Windows check the inside.

407
01:06:34,582 --> 01:06:37,642
I ain't goin' with Windows.

408
01:06:37,718 --> 01:06:41,085
I ain't goin' with him. I'll go with Childs.

409
01:06:41,155 --> 01:06:44,022
Hey, fuck you, Palmer!
I ain't goin' with you!

410
01:06:44,091 --> 01:06:46,424
Who says I want you
goin' with me? Cut the bullshit!

411
01:06:49,931 --> 01:06:52,331
Windows, you come with
us. Norris, you stay here.

412
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,927
Any of them move, you fry 'em. You
hear anything, cut loose on the sirens.

413
01:06:56,004 --> 01:06:59,906
We all meet back here
in 20 minutes regardless.

414
01:06:59,975 --> 01:07:04,173
And everybody watch whoever
you're with... real close.

415
01:07:26,401 --> 01:07:28,335
Hey, Blair.

416
01:07:30,273 --> 01:07:33,106
Blair, have you seen Fuchs?

417
01:07:36,045 --> 01:07:39,572
I don't wanna stay out here
anymore. I wanna come back inside.

418
01:07:43,319 --> 01:07:45,685
I hear funny things out here.

419
01:07:45,755 --> 01:07:48,519
Have you come across Fuchs? It ain't Fuchs.

420
01:07:51,193 --> 01:07:53,627
It ain't Fuchs.

421
01:07:55,431 --> 01:07:58,298
I'm not gonna harm anybody.
There's nothing wrong with me.

422
01:07:58,367 --> 01:08:02,167
And if there was, I'm all better
now. I'd like to come back inside.

423
01:08:02,238 --> 01:08:04,536
Now you've got my promise.

424
01:08:06,809 --> 01:08:09,209
We'll see.

425
01:08:09,278 --> 01:08:12,577
Wait a minute, man.

426
01:08:12,648 --> 01:08:16,210
I wanna come back inside,
don't you understand?

427
01:08:16,286 --> 01:08:20,484
I'm all right. I'm much better...
and I won't harm anybody.

428
01:08:20,557 --> 01:08:23,651
You gotta let me come back inside.

429
01:08:30,267 --> 01:08:32,201
Hold it!

430
01:08:46,316 --> 01:08:48,250
Is it Fuchs?

431
01:08:55,559 --> 01:08:57,891
Yeah.

432
01:08:57,961 --> 01:09:00,453
Why would it burn him?

433
01:09:00,531 --> 01:09:04,023
Flare. Maybe he tried to burn it.

434
01:09:06,437 --> 01:09:10,396
Maybe he burned himself
before it could get to him.

435
01:09:17,348 --> 01:09:20,715
Great! Now what are we gonna do?

436
01:09:22,186 --> 01:09:24,916
You go inside. Tell the
others we found Fuchs.

437
01:09:24,989 --> 01:09:28,288
We'll be in as soon as we
can. Where are we going?

438
01:09:28,359 --> 01:09:30,850
Up to my shack. What the hell for?

439
01:09:30,928 --> 01:09:34,125
'Cause when I left yesterday,
I turned the lights off.

440
01:09:56,755 --> 01:09:59,519
How long have they been out there?

441
01:09:59,591 --> 01:10:02,287
Forty, 45 minutes.

442
01:10:02,361 --> 01:10:05,421
We better start closing
off the outside doors.

443
01:10:37,464 --> 01:10:40,399
Hey! All of you, come here!

444
01:10:56,049 --> 01:10:59,746
Open up! Open up
this door! Open up! Open up!

445
01:11:01,721 --> 01:11:03,712
Close that door.

446
01:11:03,790 --> 01:11:08,124
Where's MacReady?

447
01:11:08,194 --> 01:11:11,288
I cut him loose of the line up by his shack.

448
01:11:11,364 --> 01:11:12,922
Cut him loose? Yeah.

449
01:11:12,999 --> 01:11:16,731
We were up checkin' around
his place, I found this.

450
01:11:18,272 --> 01:11:22,436
Look. It was stashed in his oil furnace.

451
01:11:22,510 --> 01:11:26,276
Wind must've dislodged it, but
I don't think he saw me find it.

452
01:11:26,347 --> 01:11:31,478
I made sure I got ahead of him on the
towline on the way back. I cut him loose.

453
01:11:31,552 --> 01:11:34,248
MacReady? He's one of'em.

454
01:11:34,321 --> 01:11:36,551
- When do you think it got to him?
- I don't know.

455
01:11:36,624 --> 01:11:38,922
It could've been anytime, anywhere.

456
01:11:38,993 --> 01:11:41,188
If it did get to him.

457
01:11:41,262 --> 01:11:44,595
Look, Childs, come on. When the lights
went out. That would've been perfect.

458
01:11:44,665 --> 01:11:48,123
Right. You said guys were
missing. Windows, where were you?

459
01:11:48,202 --> 01:11:51,171
I told you to shut your mouth!

460
01:11:51,238 --> 01:11:55,470
This is just what it
wants! To pit us against each other.

461
01:12:01,316 --> 01:12:03,284
Let's open it. Hell no!

462
01:12:03,351 --> 01:12:06,047
You think he's changed into one
of those Things? He's had time.

463
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:09,215
Nothing human could've made it back here
in this weather without a guide line.

464
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:12,158
Let's open it now. Why are you
so anxious to let him in here?

465
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:16,095
Because it's so close. May be our best
chance to blow it away. Let him freeze.

466
01:12:16,164 --> 01:12:18,928
Childs, what if we're wrong about him?

467
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,833
Well then, we're wrong!

468
01:12:21,903 --> 01:12:23,928
The supply window!

469
01:12:24,005 --> 01:12:28,101
All right, all right, we got no choice now!

470
01:12:31,112 --> 01:12:33,410
Damn it! He's got the keys!

471
01:12:33,481 --> 01:12:36,382
What's going
on? The towline snapped.

472
01:12:36,451 --> 01:12:40,251
Bullshit, Childs. He's got
to know damn well I cut it!

473
01:12:42,157 --> 01:12:45,184
You're a dead man, MacReady!

474
01:12:45,261 --> 01:12:47,559
Or a dead whatever the hell you are!

475
01:12:58,074 --> 01:13:00,565
Anyone messes with me
and the whole camp goes.

476
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:04,235
Come on, Childs, burn me.

477
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:09,213
Put those torches on the floor and back off.

478
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:19,752
Back off. Way off.

479
01:13:28,972 --> 01:13:32,032
You asshole. You'd have done the same thing.

480
01:13:32,109 --> 01:13:34,634
Don't argue with him.

481
01:13:34,711 --> 01:13:37,771
Where's the rest?

482
01:13:41,018 --> 01:13:42,918
Come on, man, I mean it!

483
01:13:42,986 --> 01:13:45,181
It's cool, MacReady, come on.

484
01:13:45,255 --> 01:13:47,723
Yeah. Yeah, man, just relax.

485
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:51,989
Anybody touches me...  and we go.

486
01:14:04,574 --> 01:14:07,771
- He's not breathin'!
- Go untie the doc.

487
01:14:09,813 --> 01:14:12,442
Get him in here. And bring the others.

488
01:14:14,652 --> 01:14:17,780
From now on, nobody gets outta my sight.

489
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,332
Let me at him.

490
01:14:34,439 --> 01:14:38,739
So, you sweethearts were about
to have a little lynching party, huh?

491
01:14:40,445 --> 01:14:44,142
I might just have to put an end to
you on general principles, Nauls.

492
01:14:44,215 --> 01:14:47,912
Did it ever occur to the jury that anybody
could've gotten some of my clothes...

493
01:14:47,985 --> 01:14:50,920
and stuck 'em up the furnace?
We ain't buyin' that.

494
01:14:50,988 --> 01:14:54,981
Quit that bickerin' over there! Windows,
wheel that defibrillator over here.

495
01:14:55,059 --> 01:14:57,290
Gimme those paddles!

496
01:14:57,362 --> 01:14:59,796
You're gonna have
to sleep sometime, MacReady.

497
01:14:59,865 --> 01:15:02,959
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs.

498
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:09,000
If anyone tries to wake me... Uh-uh.

499
01:15:09,074 --> 01:15:11,975
Clear!

500
01:15:18,851 --> 01:15:21,479
Clear! Clear.

501
01:16:21,347 --> 01:16:24,475
We're on fire, MacReady! We're
on fire! Get back! Just wait!

502
01:16:32,459 --> 01:16:34,484
All right, go!

503
01:16:55,549 --> 01:16:58,245
Windows! Windows, get in here!

504
01:17:23,311 --> 01:17:26,474
You gotta be fuckin' kidding.

505
01:17:45,433 --> 01:17:48,493
What do you got in mind,
MacReady? A little test.

506
01:17:48,570 --> 01:17:53,803
And, Windows, you and Palmer, tie
everybody down real tight. What for?

507
01:17:53,875 --> 01:17:57,903
- For your health.
- Let's rush him! He's not gonna blow us all up!

508
01:18:01,017 --> 01:18:03,884
No, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

509
01:18:03,953 --> 01:18:07,889
Let's... Let's do what Mac says.

510
01:18:07,957 --> 01:18:12,656
I mean, uh, he wasted Norris pretty quick,
didn't he? That's close enough, Clark.

511
01:18:12,728 --> 01:18:16,858
- He ain't tyin' me up.
- Then I'll have to kill you, Childs.

512
01:18:16,933 --> 01:18:19,629
Then kill me.

513
01:18:27,810 --> 01:18:30,210
I mean it.

514
01:18:35,518 --> 01:18:38,510
I guess you do.

515
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:52,892
Geez. This is bullshit, Mac!

516
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:55,837
Finish it,
Palmer. They're dead, Mac!

517
01:19:00,811 --> 01:19:03,746
Windows?  Yo?

518
01:19:03,814 --> 01:19:07,079
You tie up Palmer over here.

519
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:14,256
We're gonna draw a
little bit of everybody's blood...

520
01:19:16,259 --> 01:19:18,750
'cause we're gonna find out who's the Thing.

521
01:19:20,197 --> 01:19:24,293
Watchin'Norris in there
gave me the idea that...

522
01:19:24,368 --> 01:19:28,396
maybe every part of him was a whole.

523
01:19:28,473 --> 01:19:31,909
Every little piece was
an individual animal...

524
01:19:31,976 --> 01:19:35,275
with a built-in desire
to protect its own life.

525
01:19:37,382 --> 01:19:41,614
You see, when a man bleeds,

526
01:19:41,686 --> 01:19:44,052
it's just tissue.

527
01:19:45,556 --> 01:19:49,720
The blood from one of you Things
won't obey when it's attacked.

528
01:19:49,794 --> 01:19:52,228
It'll try and survive.

529
01:19:53,664 --> 01:19:57,100
Crawl away from a hot needle the same.

530
01:20:18,257 --> 01:20:20,248
Now you.

531
01:20:43,515 --> 01:20:45,380
That's good.

532
01:20:45,451 --> 01:20:48,181
All right, move back, over there.

533
01:21:35,468 --> 01:21:37,766
I guess you're okay.

534
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:42,768
All right. Put that on and watch them.

535
01:21:51,519 --> 01:21:54,886
Now I'll show you what I already know.

536
01:21:59,126 --> 01:22:01,594
It's a crock of shit.

537
01:22:01,662 --> 01:22:04,631
Let's try the doc and Clark.

538
01:22:22,016 --> 01:22:23,950
Now Clark.

539
01:22:32,894 --> 01:22:36,421
Then Clark was human, huh?

540
01:22:36,498 --> 01:22:39,331
Which makes you a murderer, don't it?

541
01:22:39,401 --> 01:22:41,335
Palmer now.

542
01:22:46,308 --> 01:22:50,768
This is pure nonsense.
It doesn't prove a thing.

543
01:22:50,845 --> 01:22:55,509
I thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were
the only one that could've got to that blood.

544
01:22:55,584 --> 01:22:57,848
We'll do you last.

545
01:23:00,922 --> 01:23:04,551
Get him away from me! MacReady, burn it!

546
01:23:04,626 --> 01:23:07,390
-What is it?

547
01:23:16,005 --> 01:23:17,939
-Come on!

548
01:23:25,448 --> 01:23:27,712
Get me outta here!

549
01:23:32,088 --> 01:23:34,022
Windows, blast him!

550
01:23:36,859 --> 01:23:41,523
Get me outta
here! Get me outta here!

551
01:24:09,092 --> 01:24:10,719
Windows!

552
01:24:31,181 --> 01:24:33,342
Get me outta here!

553
01:24:54,305 --> 01:24:57,832
MacReady, get in here! Come on, hurry up!

554
01:24:57,909 --> 01:25:01,276
He's coming back! Burn it!
Burn it, for God's sake!

555
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:04,543
Hurry up, MacReady! Burn it!

556
01:25:36,515 --> 01:25:38,346
Let's do it.

557
01:25:52,598 --> 01:25:55,897
Get me outta here! Cut me loose!

558
01:25:55,968 --> 01:25:59,734
Cut me the hell... Come on, get me
outta here! Come on, get me outta here!

559
01:25:59,805 --> 01:26:02,365
Cut me loose, damn it!

560
01:26:19,959 --> 01:26:23,486
I know you gentlemen have been through a lot,

561
01:26:23,563 --> 01:26:26,657
but when you find the time,

562
01:26:26,733 --> 01:26:31,796
I'd rather not spend the rest of this
winter tied to this fuckin' couch!

563
01:26:53,394 --> 01:26:55,362
Childs.

564
01:26:55,429 --> 01:26:58,956
We're goin' out to give Blair the test.
If he tries to make it back here...

565
01:26:59,033 --> 01:27:01,968
and we're not with him... burn him.

566
01:27:21,655 --> 01:27:23,953
Mac, the door's open!

567
01:27:38,707 --> 01:27:42,438
How'd he get out? The door
was bolted from the outside.

568
01:28:26,722 --> 01:28:28,781
Blair?

569
01:28:31,594 --> 01:28:36,395
Hey, Blair, you down
there? We got somethin' for ya!

570
01:28:46,876 --> 01:28:50,243
Blair's been
busy out here all by himself.

571
01:28:59,889 --> 01:29:03,290
What is it? Something he's been making.

572
01:29:03,359 --> 01:29:05,759
It's a ship of some kind.

573
01:29:06,997 --> 01:29:09,261
He stole the parts from the helicopter.

574
01:29:09,333 --> 01:29:13,394
The smart S.O.B. put it
together piece by piece.

575
01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:15,597
Where was he tryin' to go?

576
01:29:16,873 --> 01:29:19,171
Anyplace but here.

577
01:29:57,415 --> 01:30:00,748
Hey, you guys, come here. Come here.

578
01:30:07,458 --> 01:30:11,224
I think I saw Childs outside
the main entrance of the camp.

579
01:30:11,295 --> 01:30:13,889
What's he doin' outside?
I don't know.

580
01:30:24,776 --> 01:30:27,108
Got a flare?

581
01:30:29,747 --> 01:30:32,944
He got back inside and blew the generator.

582
01:30:35,019 --> 01:30:37,454
In six hours, it'll be
a hundred below in here.

583
01:30:37,523 --> 01:30:39,582
Well, that's suicide!

584
01:30:39,658 --> 01:30:42,183
Not for that Thing.

585
01:30:42,261 --> 01:30:45,890
It wants to freeze now.
It's got no way outta here.

586
01:30:45,964 --> 01:30:50,025
It just wants to go to sleep in the
cold until the rescue team finds it.

587
01:30:51,437 --> 01:30:54,167
What can we do? What can we do?

588
01:30:54,239 --> 01:30:58,403
Whether we make it or not, we
can't let that Thing freeze again.

589
01:31:00,546 --> 01:31:04,243
Maybe we'll just warm things
up a little around here.

590
01:31:07,886 --> 01:31:10,787
We're not gettin' outta here alive.

591
01:31:12,324 --> 01:31:15,020
But neither is that Thing.

592
01:33:04,706 --> 01:33:06,731
Generator room.

593
01:34:13,876 --> 01:34:15,810
The generator's gone.

594
01:34:15,878 --> 01:34:18,369
Any way we can fix it?

595
01:34:20,017 --> 01:34:22,542
It's gone, MacReady.

596
01:34:29,192 --> 01:34:32,650
All right.

597
01:34:32,729 --> 01:34:36,563
We gotta bring this whole
place right down into the ice.

598
01:34:36,633 --> 01:34:40,034
Garry, plant yours in the old storage room.

599
01:34:40,103 --> 01:34:43,869
Nauls, down by the generator.

600
01:35:32,857 --> 01:35:34,984
Ah, God!

601
01:36:45,065 --> 01:36:47,260
How's it comin' in there?

602
01:36:48,535 --> 01:36:50,469
I said, how's it...

603
01:38:35,810 --> 01:38:37,937
Yeah, fuck you too!

604
01:40:03,433 --> 01:40:06,459
You the only one who made it?

605
01:40:06,536 --> 01:40:09,004
Not the only one.

606
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:13,034
Did you kill it?

607
01:40:13,110 --> 01:40:16,671
Where were you, Childs?

608
01:40:16,747 --> 01:40:18,739
Thought I saw Blair.

609
01:40:20,018 --> 01:40:24,455
I went out after him and
got lost in the storm.

610
01:40:34,098 --> 01:40:37,295
Fire's got the temperature
up all over the camp.

611
01:40:39,370 --> 01:40:41,600
Won't last long, though.

612
01:40:41,673 --> 01:40:43,971
Neither will we.

613
01:40:46,377 --> 01:40:48,902
How will we make it?

614
01:40:50,181 --> 01:40:52,240
Maybe we shouldn't.

615
01:40:56,654 --> 01:40:58,747
If you're worried about me...

616
01:40:58,823 --> 01:41:01,792
If we've got any surprises for each other,

617
01:41:03,562 --> 01:41:07,123
I don't think we're in much
shape to do anything about it.

618
01:41:11,036 --> 01:41:15,029
Well... what do we do?

619
01:41:16,208 --> 01:41:18,506
Why don't we just...

620
01:41:19,778 --> 01:41:22,770
wait here for a little while?

621
01:41:24,450 --> 01:41:26,418
See what happens.
