1
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:46,970
Mary Dinkle's eyes were the colour
of muddy puddles.

2
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,518
Her birthmark, the colour of poo.

3
00:03:01,627 --> 00:03:03,743
(Dogs bark)

4
00:03:03,961 --> 00:03:08,321
It was Saturday afternoon
and she was bored.

5
00:03:08,503 --> 00:03:12,462
Mary wished she had a friend
to play piggybacks with.

6
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,521
Mary's mood ring, which she'd found
in a cereal box, was grey

7
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:32,039
which, according to the chart,

8
00:03:32,131 --> 00:03:39,091
meant she was either pensive,
unconsciously ambitious or hungry.

9
00:03:39,382 --> 00:03:43,342
Her only friends were 'The Noblets'
from her favourite cartoon.

10
00:03:43,507 --> 00:03:46,827
They weren't the real ones
you bought in the shops

11
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:51,206
but fake ones she had to make herself
from shells, gumnuts, pompoms

12
00:03:51,383 --> 00:03:56,303
and the chicken bones salvaged
from Friday night's takeaway.

13
00:03:56,509 --> 00:04:00,509
She had to make all her own toys,
and her favourites were Shrinkies

14
00:04:00,676 --> 00:04:04,828
potato chip packets that
she had shrunk in the oven.

15
00:04:08,927 --> 00:04:12,087
Mary's father, Noel Norman Dinkle,

16
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:15,499
worked in a factory,
attaching the strings to tea bags.

17
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:19,581
At show and tell, she told the class

18
00:04:19,678 --> 00:04:24,798
he could get as many free tea bags
as he wanted.

19
00:04:25,012 --> 00:04:28,772
Her favourite tea bag was Earl Grey.

20
00:04:28,929 --> 00:04:33,089
She loved saying "Earl Grey"

21
00:04:33,263 --> 00:04:38,423
and would like one day to marry
someone called Earl Grey.

22
00:04:40,306 --> 00:04:42,137
They would live
in a castle in Scotland,

23
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,828
have 9 babies, 2 ducks...

24
00:04:44,931 --> 00:04:46,731
..and a dog called Kevin.

25
00:04:49,307 --> 00:04:53,027
Noel's hobby was to sit in his shed
and drink Baileys lrish Cream

26
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:58,182
and stuff birds he'd found
on the side of the freeway.

27
00:04:58,391 --> 00:05:04,991
Mary wished he'd spend more time
with her and less with his dead friends.

28
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:08,907
She also wished she had
some brothers and sisters.

29
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:12,449
Her mother had told her
she was "an accident".

30
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:16,485
How could someone be an accident?

31
00:05:16,644 --> 00:05:20,684
Grandpoppy Ralph had told her
that babies were deliberate

32
00:05:20,852 --> 00:05:24,162
and found by dads
at the bottom of their beer.

33
00:05:26,353 --> 00:05:29,513
Grandpoppy Ralph
had smelt like pickled onions

34
00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:34,765
and had been a member of the Frankston
lce Breakers for 51 years.

35
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,019
Aaagh! Aaaaaghhh!

36
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:40,224
They swam in winter to feel alive.

37
00:05:40,355 --> 00:05:46,395
Grandpoppy Ralph had said
it made his nipples erect.

38
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:49,247
He had died the year before, aged 74,

39
00:05:49,356 --> 00:05:54,676
and his best mate, Ken,
had recited a poem in his honour.

40
00:05:54,898 --> 00:05:58,258
Born in a barn
in the hills of Boronia,

41
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,199
Ralph lived a long life,

42
00:06:00,274 --> 00:06:03,754
then died of pneumonia.

43
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:04,809
Mary missed him

44
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:09,461
and often wondered
why he had drunk ammonia.

45
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,530
A lot of things puzzled Mary

46
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,848
especially her mother,
Vera Lorraine Dinkle.

47
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:22,061
To Mary, Vera always seemed wobbly.

48
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:25,068
A pretty vicious ball.
And he's out!

49
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:29,273
Vera liked listening
to the cricket while baking

50
00:06:29,527 --> 00:06:33,487
and her main ingredient
was always sherry.

51
00:06:33,653 --> 00:06:36,733
3/44. And Thompson 2/15...

52
00:06:36,862 --> 00:06:39,742
She told Mary it was a type of tea
for grown-ups

53
00:06:39,862 --> 00:06:42,742
that needed constant testing.

54
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:46,537
Just out of the reach
of the lead. 6/96 England.

55
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:56,219
Mary thought her mother tested
the sherry...way too much.

56
00:06:58,906 --> 00:07:04,426
Mary also couldn't understand
why Vera was always "borrowing".

57
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:09,577
Yesterday, she borrowed
some fish fingers from Aisle 6.

58
00:07:09,782 --> 00:07:13,900
She told Mary she put things
up her dress to save on plastic bags.

59
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:21,311
Vera was indeed a complicated soul.

60
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,707
Oooh!

61
00:07:33,994 --> 00:07:35,268
Mary stopped daydreaming

62
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:38,084
and went and fetched
her pet rooster from the rain.

63
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:44,568
Her father had found the rooster
on the side of the freeway

64
00:07:44,703 --> 00:07:48,743
after it had fallen off the back
of a slaughter truck.

65
00:07:48,912 --> 00:07:50,903
She named him Ethel.

66
00:07:54,871 --> 00:07:59,023
It was time to watch "The Noblets".
She adored "The Noblets"

67
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:03,118
because everyone was brown,
lived in a teapot

68
00:08:03,372 --> 00:08:06,972
and had oodles of friends.

69
00:08:07,123 --> 00:08:09,843
There was nothing nicer,
Mary thought to herself,

70
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,556
than the smell of a wet rooster...

71
00:08:12,665 --> 00:08:14,417
..the sound of rain on the roof

72
00:08:14,582 --> 00:08:18,862
and the taste of sweetened
condensed milk straight from the can

73
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:23,159
while watching your favourite cartoon.

74
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:13,063
Meanwhile, a man called Max Horowitz
also watched "The Noblets".

75
00:09:16,173 --> 00:09:20,453
Max's small television
had picture but no sound.

76
00:09:20,632 --> 00:09:25,152
His big television, sound but no picture.

77
00:09:25,341 --> 00:09:27,621
He was 44 and liked "The Noblets"

78
00:09:27,716 --> 00:09:31,476
as they lived in a delineated
and articulated social structure

79
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:34,833
with constant adherent conformity

80
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:38,721
and also because they had
oodles of friends.

81
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:42,939
Max had trouble sleeping

82
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:49,214
and had spent the night watching
television and catching fish food.

83
00:09:49,468 --> 00:09:53,939
He noted to himself it was the sixth fly
he'd caught this evening.

84
00:09:58,345 --> 00:10:01,705
He wondered if he should go to bed
and count sheep

85
00:10:01,845 --> 00:10:05,525
or have one more chocolate hotdog.

86
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,959
He thought he'd try both
but it didn't work.

87
00:10:10,138 --> 00:10:16,378
It had been 6 hours and 12 minutes since
Henry Vlll had passed away.

88
00:10:16,638 --> 00:10:19,878
And Henry's death
had thrown Max's life into disarray.

89
00:10:21,181 --> 00:10:23,101
It had become asymmetrical

90
00:10:23,181 --> 00:10:26,696
and the sooner
he got a new fish, the better.

91
00:10:29,848 --> 00:10:33,523
Tomorrow he would go to the pet store
and get another Henry

92
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,563
Henry lX.

93
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:54,694
Next.

94
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,210
It was shopping day

95
00:10:56,268 --> 00:11:03,148
and Mary sat patiently while her mother
"borrowed" some envelopes.

96
00:11:03,436 --> 00:11:06,076
To fill in time, she scanned the room

97
00:11:06,186 --> 00:11:09,066
and counted how many things
were brown.

98
00:11:09,186 --> 00:11:11,546
There was sticky tape, rubber bands

99
00:11:11,645 --> 00:11:16,045
and a phone book with a picture
of a lady standing in a brown lake

100
00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:18,265
with her hand on fire.

101
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:24,999
People had weird names in America,
Mary Daisy Dinkle thought to herself.

102
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:30,030
Funny-sounding people called
Rockefeller and Finkelstein.

103
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:33,471
She wondered what they looked like,
how old they were

104
00:11:33,606 --> 00:11:39,326
and if they were married, wore glasses,
or had found babies in their beer.

105
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,685
Maybe in the USA
they found babies elsewhere.

106
00:11:42,816 --> 00:11:45,416
Hmm...
They drank a lot of cola.

107
00:11:45,524 --> 00:11:48,884
Maybe they found them in cans.

108
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:51,745
But, no, they wouldn't fit
through the hole.

109
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:56,275
Mary had an idea.

110
00:11:56,401 --> 00:12:02,321
She would write to one of the Americans
and ask where babies came from.

111
00:12:02,568 --> 00:12:06,277
She chose a Mr M Horowitz.

112
00:12:15,153 --> 00:12:18,393
Aarrgh, Mrs Dinkle!

113
00:12:18,528 --> 00:12:22,806
Come back here, Vera Dinkle!
You come back here!

114
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:24,723
Aaarghhhh!

115
00:12:26,154 --> 00:12:28,914
Dear Mr M Horowitz,

116
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:32,950
my name is Mary Daisy Dinkle

117
00:12:33,113 --> 00:12:38,824
and I am 8 years old,
3 months and 9 days.

118
00:12:39,447 --> 00:12:41,647
My favourite colour is brown

119
00:12:41,739 --> 00:12:45,659
and my favourite food
is sweetened condensed milk

120
00:12:45,823 --> 00:12:49,343
followed closely by chocolate.

121
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:54,290
I have a rooster called Ethel
that looks like this.

122
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:57,171
He doesn't lay eggs but will one day.

123
00:12:58,783 --> 00:13:02,059
My mother likes smoking,
cricket and sherry

124
00:13:02,284 --> 00:13:07,604
and my father likes playing in his shed
with dead birds.

125
00:13:07,826 --> 00:13:10,546
Where do babies come from
in America?

126
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,700
Do they come from cola cans?

127
00:13:12,785 --> 00:13:17,097
In Australia
they are found in beer glasses.

128
00:13:17,369 --> 00:13:18,889
Here is a drawing of me.

129
00:13:18,952 --> 00:13:22,149
I can't draw ears proper
but I'm good at teeth.

130
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:27,683
It would be great if you could write back
and be my friend.

131
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,704
Yours "sincerealy", Mary Daisy Dinkle.

132
00:13:32,996 --> 00:13:38,116
PS. I hope you like the chocolate bar
I'm also sending.

133
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,968
It's called a Cherry Ripe.

134
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,395
Goodbye, letter. Don't forget to write.

135
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:32,119
Max hated Thursdays

136
00:14:32,211 --> 00:14:36,090
the day of his weekly
Overeaters Anonymous meeting.

137
00:14:36,337 --> 00:14:39,697
And tonight he'd felt
especially unsettled

138
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:44,317
because he'd eaten two chocolate
hotdogs on his way there.

139
00:14:44,504 --> 00:14:45,664
OK, class...

140
00:14:45,713 --> 00:14:49,103
Eating chocolate was breaking the rules.

141
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,220
He'd found the night
even more unbearable

142
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:55,139
because of Marjorie Butterworth's
strange glances.

143
00:14:55,256 --> 00:14:56,814
Class dismissed.

144
00:14:56,964 --> 00:15:02,484
Max had trouble understanding
non-verbal signals.

145
00:15:02,715 --> 00:15:06,344
Flirting was as foreign to him
as jogging.

146
00:15:12,174 --> 00:15:15,769
Max found most people very confusing.

147
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:18,867
But little did Max realise

148
00:15:18,925 --> 00:15:23,316
his night was about to become
even more confusing and cryptic.

149
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:28,398
Hmm.

150
00:15:31,052 --> 00:15:38,561
He read Mary's letter four times
and then did what he normally did

151
00:15:38,969 --> 00:15:42,359
whenever confronted
with something new and stressful.

152
00:15:53,054 --> 00:15:59,414
Max's fragile existence
had once again become unsettled.

153
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,440
And after staring out of the window
for 18 hours

154
00:16:03,597 --> 00:16:05,677
he finally made a decision.

155
00:16:27,684 --> 00:16:30,324
Dear Mary Daisy Dinkle,

156
00:16:30,434 --> 00:16:34,634
thank you for the letter,
which I opened and read at 9.1 7pm

157
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:39,564
after my Overeaters Anonymous class.

158
00:16:39,852 --> 00:16:41,652
I am trying to lose weight

159
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:45,007
because my psychiatrist,
Dr Bernard Hazelhof,

160
00:16:45,144 --> 00:16:48,614
says a healthy body
equals a healthy mind.

161
00:16:49,395 --> 00:16:50,875
Ooooh!

162
00:16:50,936 --> 00:16:54,724
He says my mind is not that healthy.

163
00:16:54,979 --> 00:17:00,259
Your drawing is an interesting
visual portrayal of yourself.

164
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:03,399
I have never met anyone from Australia.

165
00:17:03,521 --> 00:17:06,433
Firstly, I will answer your question.

166
00:17:09,522 --> 00:17:14,602
Unfortunately, in America,
babies are not found in cola cans.

167
00:17:14,814 --> 00:17:17,534
I asked my mother when I was four

168
00:17:17,648 --> 00:17:22,802
and she said they came from eggs
laid by rabbis.

169
00:17:23,107 --> 00:17:26,467
If you aren't Jewish,
they're laid by Catholic nuns.

170
00:17:26,607 --> 00:17:31,407
If you're an atheist,
they're laid by dirty, lonely prostitutes.

171
00:17:31,608 --> 00:17:35,448
So this is where babies come from
in America.

172
00:17:35,608 --> 00:17:37,928
I share my home with a fish,

173
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:43,625
some snails, whom I have named
after famous scientists...

174
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:48,339
..a parakeet called Mr Biscuit

175
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:51,287
and, finally, a cat called Hal.

176
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:57,842
"Hal" is an abbreviation for halitosis,
from which he suffers.

177
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:00,551
He followed me home
after a gang of children

178
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:02,693
shot his eye out with a beebee gun.

179
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:06,669
Do you have a pet kangaroo?

180
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:10,819
When I was born, my father
left my mother and me on a kibbutz.

181
00:18:10,988 --> 00:18:14,308
She shot herself with my uncle's gun
when I was six.

182
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,207
Do you like chocolate hotdogs?

183
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:23,200
I invented the recipe for them
and can send it to you.

184
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:29,566
When I was young, I invented
an invisible friend called Mr Ravioli.

185
00:18:29,823 --> 00:18:32,903
My psychiatrist says
I don't need him anymore

186
00:18:33,032 --> 00:18:36,627
so he just sits in the corner and reads.

187
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:46,753
Last week I picked up
128 cigarette butts.

188
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:50,032
People are always littering in New York.

189
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:54,719
I do not understand
why people break laws.

190
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:58,030
Butts are bad
because they wash out to sea

191
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,280
and fish smoke them
and become nicotine dependent.

192
00:19:03,494 --> 00:19:06,894
I am just joking because, of course,

193
00:19:07,036 --> 00:19:11,876
it is impossible for a cigarette
to remain lit underwater.

194
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,550
Also, fish do not have pockets
to keep cigarette lighters in.

195
00:19:21,788 --> 00:19:23,908
I am 44 years old

196
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:27,477
and have 8 tracksuits
the same colour and size.

197
00:19:30,956 --> 00:19:33,316
I weigh 352 lb...

198
00:19:33,414 --> 00:19:35,414
Ooooh!

199
00:19:35,498 --> 00:19:37,966
..and am as tall as a 6-foot tree.

200
00:19:38,248 --> 00:19:40,608
Welcome to the New York Lottery!

201
00:19:40,707 --> 00:19:42,379
I enjoy entering the lottery

202
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:46,141
and have chosen the same numbers
for 9 years.

203
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,251
Those numbers are 3...
1.

204
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,375
5...
4.

205
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,418
6...
25.

206
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,060
9...
2.

207
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,605
11...
(7.

208
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,867
And 12.
8.

209
00:20:01,126 --> 00:20:03,286
Are you a winner?

210
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:05,014
Or a loser?

211
00:20:05,168 --> 00:20:08,368
I have had many different jobs
during my life.

212
00:20:08,502 --> 00:20:14,262
My first job was collecting
subway tokens in the subway.

213
00:20:14,503 --> 00:20:17,863
My second job was at Yiddel's
Gourmet Kosher Supplies

214
00:20:18,003 --> 00:20:22,523
where I worked at the machine that made
pre-packaged noodle kugels.

215
00:20:22,712 --> 00:20:26,352
I was born Jewish
and used to believe in God

216
00:20:26,504 --> 00:20:28,017
but I've since read many books

217
00:20:28,171 --> 00:20:32,571
that have proven God
is just a figment of my imagination.

218
00:20:32,755 --> 00:20:36,515
People like to believe in God because
it answers complicated questions

219
00:20:36,672 --> 00:20:40,112
Iike where did the universe come from,

220
00:20:40,256 --> 00:20:41,456
do worms go to heaven...

221
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:42,986
do worms go to heaven...

222
00:20:43,048 --> 00:20:46,085
..and why do old ladies have blue hair?

223
00:20:46,298 --> 00:20:48,058
Even though I'm an atheist,

224
00:20:48,132 --> 00:20:52,532
I still wear my yarmulke
as it keeps my brain warm.

225
00:20:52,716 --> 00:20:58,876
My third job was for a company
that printed logos on novelty items.

226
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,443
I worked at the frisbee printing machine.

227
00:21:02,675 --> 00:21:07,955
A frisbee is a circular plastic disc
that people throw at each other.

228
00:21:08,176 --> 00:21:09,848
It is like a boomerang

229
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,832
but it does not come back.

230
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:18,844
My fourth job was when
I was called up for jury duty.

231
00:21:19,094 --> 00:21:24,534
I didn't get paid much
but got free cookies and coffee.

232
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:28,197
Jurors are outstanding members
of the community

233
00:21:28,428 --> 00:21:31,148
who haven't murdered anybody.

234
00:21:31,262 --> 00:21:32,902
I made it to the short list

235
00:21:32,971 --> 00:21:36,327
for a trial where a man
killed all his friends

236
00:21:36,554 --> 00:21:39,514
at his own surprise birthday party.

237
00:21:39,638 --> 00:21:43,318
Unfortunately, I didn't get selected
because they found out

238
00:21:43,472 --> 00:21:45,872
I'd been a mental patient at one point.

239
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,864
Have you ever been hang gliding?

240
00:21:49,973 --> 00:21:53,533
My fifth job was as a garbage collector.

241
00:21:53,682 --> 00:21:58,322
I got to clean up after litterbugs
and didn't have to talk to anybody.

242
00:21:58,515 --> 00:22:02,115
Sometimes I used to pretend
I was an intergalactical robot.

243
00:22:13,726 --> 00:22:16,406
This is 911.
Your call has been placed in a queue.

244
00:22:16,518 --> 00:22:19,558
One time the police took me in
for questioning

245
00:22:19,685 --> 00:22:23,245
but let me go when they decided
I wasn't a threat to anybody

246
00:22:23,393 --> 00:22:25,393
except myself.

247
00:22:27,727 --> 00:22:33,287
The sixth job I had
was for the United States Army

248
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,080
in the stationery supply department.

249
00:22:37,228 --> 00:22:39,068
Because I am good with numbers

250
00:22:39,145 --> 00:22:43,345
I had to work out how many
ballpoint pens the Army needed.

251
00:22:43,521 --> 00:22:45,721
One day they did a security check

252
00:22:45,813 --> 00:22:49,573
and asked whether I was a member
of any radical groups.

253
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:54,050
I told them I was a member of
the New York Science Fiction Fan Club.

254
00:22:54,231 --> 00:22:59,111
They said this didn't count
but dismissed me anyway.

255
00:22:59,314 --> 00:23:04,514
Fortunately, I did not remember
to tell them I was once a communist.

256
00:23:04,732 --> 00:23:07,121
Have you ever been a communist?

257
00:23:08,107 --> 00:23:12,467
Have you ever been attacked by a crow
or similar large bird?

258
00:23:12,649 --> 00:23:15,409
When I was 9, a crow attacked me
on my way to school.

259
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:24,134
I had to have three stitches

260
00:23:24,276 --> 00:23:28,349
and in spring I now wear a helmet
with eyes I have painted on.

261
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,410
People laugh at me
when I wear my helmet.

262
00:23:31,527 --> 00:23:33,767
I'm not sure why.

263
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,460
People often confuse me
but I try not to let them worry me.

264
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:44,518
New York is a very busy
and noisy place.

265
00:23:44,653 --> 00:23:47,173
I would prefer to live
somewhere much quieter

266
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,554
Iike the moon.

267
00:23:49,737 --> 00:23:55,697
I don't like crowds, bright lights,
sudden noises or strong smells.

268
00:23:55,946 --> 00:23:58,666
New York has all these

269
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,540
especially the smells.

270
00:24:01,864 --> 00:24:05,384
I often wear nose and ear plugs
when I go outside.

271
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:08,731
It helps keep me calm.

272
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:14,385
I find humans interesting but I have
trouble understanding them.

273
00:24:14,615 --> 00:24:19,450
I think, however,
I will understand and trust you.

274
00:24:21,241 --> 00:24:25,881
You appear very happy and I think
you would smell like a shrimp

275
00:24:26,075 --> 00:24:29,306
as I know Australia
has a lot of shrimps.

276
00:24:31,534 --> 00:24:33,254
Can you speed-read?

277
00:24:33,326 --> 00:24:36,606
I have taught myself to read
two pages at once

278
00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:39,863
one eyeball per page.

279
00:24:39,993 --> 00:24:41,313
I have to go now

280
00:24:41,369 --> 00:24:44,329
even though I have not told you
about my 7th job,

281
00:24:44,452 --> 00:24:47,212
in a condom factory.

282
00:24:47,328 --> 00:24:48,968
Write back soon.

283
00:24:49,036 --> 00:24:55,476
Your American friend,
Max Jerry Horowitz.

284
00:24:55,745 --> 00:25:00,505
PS. Please find enclosed
a photo from one of those booths.

285
00:25:00,704 --> 00:25:04,504
PPS. Thank you for the Cherry Ripe

286
00:25:04,663 --> 00:25:08,103
and I am glad you like chocolate
as much as I do.

287
00:25:08,247 --> 00:25:11,087
I have never eaten
sweetened condensed milk

288
00:25:11,206 --> 00:25:14,326
but I will try some this week.

289
00:25:14,456 --> 00:25:18,927
PPPS. I have never used a condom.

290
00:25:19,207 --> 00:25:21,163
Gey gezunterheyt.

291
00:25:23,957 --> 00:25:26,837
Max hoped
Mary would write again.

292
00:25:26,957 --> 00:25:29,877
He'd always wanted a friend.

293
00:25:29,999 --> 00:25:36,679
A friend that wasn't invisible,
a pet or rubber figurine.

294
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:41,759
He counted the stars and wondered
how many days, hours, minutes

295
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:46,475
it would take his letter
to reach Australia.

296
00:25:51,502 --> 00:25:53,732
Vera was not impressed...

297
00:25:56,253 --> 00:25:57,893
Aaaarrgh!

298
00:25:57,961 --> 00:26:01,321
..not impressed at all.

299
00:26:01,462 --> 00:26:07,262
This nutcase would not be her daughter's
penfriend, she thought.

300
00:26:07,504 --> 00:26:10,344
There was enough ugliness in the world.

301
00:26:10,463 --> 00:26:13,103
Mary would be home from school
in an hour

302
00:26:13,213 --> 00:26:17,933
enough time for another cup of tea
and a bit of cricket to soothe the nerves

303
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:22,450
and dissolve the memory of Max's letter
from her pickled mind.

304
00:26:22,631 --> 00:26:27,147
Yeah, he's out.
Unbelievable. 14. England 7/150.

305
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,380
Stop! Wait!

306
00:27:01,511 --> 00:27:06,311
Hey, fellas, you got room
for one more bag?

307
00:27:06,511 --> 00:27:10,111
Sure, Mrs Dinkle. Hop in!

308
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:12,253
Good one, Kevin!

309
00:27:12,887 --> 00:27:15,167
Aaaarghhh!

310
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,793
Come on, Vera.
We've got some other bags to pick up!

311
00:27:30,097 --> 00:27:33,533
Ooh. Hmm.

312
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,500
Mary, is that all the rubbish?

313
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:42,519
Yep!

314
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:45,159
See ya, Toots!

315
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:47,541
Sweet baby Jesus.

316
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,834
Ooooah!

317
00:28:01,851 --> 00:28:06,720
Even though Max's letter smelt
like fish heads and orange peel,

318
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:11,020
Mary drank his words
like a bowl of alphabet soup

319
00:28:11,186 --> 00:28:13,386
and hadn't been this excited

320
00:28:13,478 --> 00:28:18,677
since Grandpoppy Ralph
had found a coin up her nose.

321
00:28:18,978 --> 00:28:20,538
She wrote back immediately

322
00:28:20,604 --> 00:28:25,044
on some butchers' paper
she'd stolen from some chops.

323
00:28:25,229 --> 00:28:29,149
Dear Max,
I'm so excited you've wroted back.

324
00:28:29,313 --> 00:28:33,193
I don't think my parents like you
so from now on

325
00:28:33,355 --> 00:28:36,515
send stuff to my neighbour Len Hislop

326
00:28:36,647 --> 00:28:41,562
at 26 Lamington Drive,
Mt Waverley.

327
00:28:41,898 --> 00:28:44,698
He's old with no legs.

328
00:28:44,815 --> 00:28:47,495
They got chew"d"ed off
in World War ll

329
00:28:47,607 --> 00:28:51,407
when some Japanese peoples
kept him in a cage above piranhas.

330
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:56,797
Piranhas are goldfish that have teeth.

331
00:28:58,692 --> 00:29:03,852
He's scared of outside,
which is a disease called homophobia.

332
00:29:06,484 --> 00:29:09,964
He's started giving me 50 cents a week
to get his mail.

333
00:29:11,318 --> 00:29:17,958
I'm saving to buy a castle in Scotland
and marry a man called Earl Grey.

334
00:29:18,236 --> 00:29:20,636
Do you get "The Noblets" in America?

335
00:29:20,736 --> 00:29:24,576
Well, my favourite Noblet
is Vanity Noblet.

336
00:29:24,736 --> 00:29:30,376
He wants to be everyone's friend,
even the boys'!

337
00:29:30,612 --> 00:29:34,212
In your letter, you said
you had no friends.

338
00:29:34,363 --> 00:29:36,563
Well, neither do l.

339
00:29:36,654 --> 00:29:39,293
A-ha!

340
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:43,276
Yesterday at school, Bernie Clifford weed
on my spam sandwich

341
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:47,530
and called me "poo face"
'cos of my birthmark.

342
00:29:47,697 --> 00:29:50,737
I wish I could peel it off like a bandaid.

343
00:29:50,865 --> 00:29:54,105
He also laughed
'cos I had no buttons.

344
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,320
Ethel pecked them off

345
00:29:56,407 --> 00:30:00,767
and Mum couldn't thread a needle
'cos she'd been testing the sherry

346
00:30:00,949 --> 00:30:02,382
so she used pegs instead.

347
00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:12,055
When I got home, I climbed into
my secret place till dinner time.

348
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:15,089
The other kids also laugh at my haircut.

349
00:30:15,201 --> 00:30:17,881
Dad has to cut my hair
because mum says

350
00:30:17,993 --> 00:30:20,993
real hairdressers
sell your hair to Chinamen

351
00:30:21,118 --> 00:30:22,638
who stuff mattresses.

352
00:30:25,244 --> 00:30:29,084
My teacher, Mrs Pendergast,
says I should smile more.

353
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:33,999
I told my mum
and so she drawed a big smile on me.

354
00:30:37,245 --> 00:30:40,125
I don't think Mrs Pendergast
likes me anymore.

355
00:30:45,746 --> 00:30:50,426
I better go now.
My tears are smudgling my words.

356
00:30:50,622 --> 00:30:56,022
Your friend in Australia,
Mary Daisy Dinkle.

357
00:30:56,247 --> 00:31:03,207
PS. Have you ever been teased?
Can you help me?

358
00:31:03,498 --> 00:31:09,738
PSS. I've never been hang gliding
before or been a "commune-ist"

359
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:15,039
but would love a frisbee
and your recipe for chocolate hotdogs.

360
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:22,130
PSSS. I'm sending you some
Australian chocolate, a pompom I made

361
00:31:22,417 --> 00:31:26,695
and a cake called a lamington,
which I was meant to eat for lunch.

362
00:31:52,588 --> 00:31:54,465
Have you ever been teased?

363
00:31:56,463 --> 00:31:58,693
Ooooooooooaaaahhhh!

364
00:31:58,922 --> 00:32:00,842
Mary's letter
triggered memories

365
00:32:00,922 --> 00:32:04,482
Max had buried deep down in his shoes.

366
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:08,829
We've got him cornered now.
Hey, Jew-boy, you're gonna pay...

367
00:32:09,715 --> 00:32:14,311
Take this, Jew-boy, Jew-boy, Jew-boy.

368
00:32:17,216 --> 00:32:21,255
And as usual,
he coped in the only way he knew.

369
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:33,947
And 36 chocolate hotdogs later...

370
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,200
..and after only two hours sleep,

371
00:32:39,343 --> 00:32:46,303
Max's meltdown faded away
and an idea popped into his brain.

372
00:32:48,678 --> 00:32:51,511
Dear Mary Daisy Dinkle,

373
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:57,440
thank you for your letter, chocolate bar,
lamington and pompom.

374
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,919
The chocolate got crushed, so I blended
the bits with milk and icecream

375
00:33:02,096 --> 00:33:04,610
and now I am drinking it right now.

376
00:33:07,805 --> 00:33:12,005
After much thought, I think I have
a solution to your teasing.

377
00:33:12,181 --> 00:33:14,217
Tell Bernie Clifford
your birthmark is made of chocolate,

378
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:19,221
which means when you get to heaven

379
00:33:19,307 --> 00:33:22,827
you will be in charge
of all the chocolate.

380
00:33:22,974 --> 00:33:26,614
This of course is a lie
I do not like lies

381
00:33:26,766 --> 00:33:30,475
but in this case
I think it will be of benefit.

382
00:33:30,725 --> 00:33:34,485
I wish I could be in charge
of all the chocolate

383
00:33:34,642 --> 00:33:39,113
but, of course, I cannot
because of my atheism.

384
00:33:41,476 --> 00:33:44,076
My neighbour lvy is also an atheist.

385
00:33:44,185 --> 00:33:50,425
She doesn't talk much but makes me
very good soup on Sunday nights.

386
00:33:50,685 --> 00:33:52,645
She is partly blind

387
00:33:52,727 --> 00:33:57,287
and sometimes I find her hair
in my soup. Eeugh!

388
00:33:57,478 --> 00:34:04,638
I do not tell her as Dr Bernard Hazelhof
says this would be impolite.

389
00:34:04,937 --> 00:34:08,457
Here is a list of what I eat
on the other nights.

390
00:34:08,604 --> 00:34:10,884
Mondays - Glicks Potato Knish,

391
00:34:10,979 --> 00:34:13,979
Tuesdays - Yiddels Noodle Kugel,

392
00:34:14,105 --> 00:34:17,345
Wednesdays -
Captain Salty's Fishstix,

393
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,120
Thursdays - Yentls Cheezy Blintz

394
00:34:20,231 --> 00:34:23,507
and Fridays - chicken nuggets.

395
00:34:23,731 --> 00:34:27,131
On Saturday nights
I create my own recipes.

396
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:31,633
Last week I invented
canned spaghetti hamburgers.

397
00:34:31,815 --> 00:34:35,095
Recipes are like
mathematical equations.

398
00:34:35,232 --> 00:34:41,912
Dr Bernard Hazelhof told me you should
never weigh more than your refrigerator

399
00:34:42,192 --> 00:34:46,912
and to never eat
anything bigger than your head.

400
00:34:47,109 --> 00:34:50,863
I once ate a watermelon
bigger than my head

401
00:34:51,151 --> 00:34:53,949
but not all at once.

402
00:34:54,151 --> 00:34:57,831
Do you have
any weight loss suggestions?

403
00:34:57,985 --> 00:35:00,985
My Overeaters Anonymous meetings
don't seem to be working

404
00:35:01,111 --> 00:35:04,111
and just make me tense.

405
00:35:10,737 --> 00:35:13,937
It would be good
if there was a "Fat Fairy".

406
00:35:15,862 --> 00:35:20,333
She would be a bit like the Tooth Fairy
but would suck out your fat.

407
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:31,049
Ivy says she is only a "little bit" blind
but I think she is very blind.

408
00:35:31,281 --> 00:35:34,910
She should get a cane
like other vision-impaired people.

409
00:35:36,031 --> 00:35:38,551
She could make the end pointy

410
00:35:38,657 --> 00:35:41,012
and collect rubbish at the same time.

411
00:35:42,616 --> 00:35:46,291
I think I will write a letter to the Mayor
and suggest this.

412
00:35:46,533 --> 00:35:50,093
He will be very impressed.

413
00:35:50,242 --> 00:35:55,322
Ivy says she doesn't need a cane
because she has a good sense of smell.

414
00:35:57,409 --> 00:36:02,489
She says she could find me
with her eyes stapled shut.

415
00:36:02,701 --> 00:36:06,933
She says I smell like liquorice
and old books.

416
00:36:11,161 --> 00:36:16,441
I think she smells like cough medicine
and urine.

417
00:36:16,661 --> 00:36:18,541
I have never told her this

418
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:23,860
as Dr Bernard Hazelhof said
this would also be impolite.

419
00:36:28,205 --> 00:36:30,639
People often think
I am tactless and rude.

420
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:40,240
I cannot understand how
being honest can be...improper.

421
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:46,018
Maybe this is why
I don't have any friends

422
00:36:46,248 --> 00:36:47,966
of course except for you.

423
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:52,365
A real friend has been
one of my three goals in life.

424
00:36:54,541 --> 00:37:00,616
The other two are to own every Noblet
and a lifetime supply of chocolate.

425
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,320
Dr Bernard Hazelhof says
it is good to have goals

426
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:12,421
but not stupid ones like mine.

427
00:37:12,627 --> 00:37:14,857
I have now run out of things to tell you.

428
00:37:18,044 --> 00:37:20,084
Please, write soon.

429
00:37:20,169 --> 00:37:25,969
Your friend in America,
Max Jerry Horowitz.

430
00:37:26,212 --> 00:37:30,492
PS. Do not worry about not smiling.

431
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:33,110
My mouth hardly ever smiles

432
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:37,852
but it does not mean
I am not smiling inside my brain.

433
00:37:40,047 --> 00:37:44,287
PPS. Please find enclosed a frisbee,

434
00:37:44,464 --> 00:37:47,664
some Chocolate Pop Rocks,
which you should eat with cola,

435
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:53,555
and an illustration of a turtle
from one of my National Geographics.

436
00:37:53,882 --> 00:37:59,161
PPPS. Did you know that turtles
can breathe through their anuses?

437
00:38:03,758 --> 00:38:05,558
Dear Max,

438
00:38:05,633 --> 00:38:07,593
when I told Bernie Clifford

439
00:38:07,675 --> 00:38:11,435
I'll be in charge of all the chocolate
in heaven and he wouldn't get any,

440
00:38:11,592 --> 00:38:12,952
he cried.

441
00:38:14,717 --> 00:38:20,037
I also hide'd some dog's poo
in his bit of the sandpit.

442
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:24,378
Your advice was great and
I've got a job delivering pamphlets

443
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,715
so I can save to come and see you.

444
00:38:27,844 --> 00:38:29,884
I am sad to hear you are fat.

445
00:38:29,969 --> 00:38:34,167
Mum says I am fat too
and I'm growing up to be a heifer,

446
00:38:34,428 --> 00:38:38,068
which I think is a type of cow.

447
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:42,540
Maybe you should only eat things
beginning with the letter of each day.

448
00:38:42,721 --> 00:38:45,121
On Mondays you could only eat

449
00:38:45,221 --> 00:38:50,741
milkshakes, marshmallows
and...mustard.

450
00:38:50,972 --> 00:38:52,532
Oooh!

451
00:38:56,264 --> 00:39:00,784
For my birthday, my Mum baked a cake
and Dad gave me a camera.

452
00:39:02,598 --> 00:39:05,438
I hope you like the photos I sent.

453
00:39:05,557 --> 00:39:08,877
The first one is of Ethel,
who ate some tinsel.

454
00:39:09,016 --> 00:39:11,536
The next one is one of myself

455
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:16,601
after I ate the Chocolate Pop Rocks
with the cola, like you said.

456
00:39:16,808 --> 00:39:18,768
Next is Len.

457
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:25,085
He's still trying hard not to be afraid of
outside and conquer his homophobia.

458
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:32,370
The next one is of dad in his shed,

459
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:35,679
and then one of the times
I covered mum

460
00:39:35,811 --> 00:39:39,771
while she was asleep in her stickers
that help her stop smoking.

461
00:39:39,936 --> 00:39:44,136
Next, when I got my slinky
caught in my hair.

462
00:39:44,312 --> 00:39:49,072
Then one of the times Sonny
digged up his wife, Cher.

463
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:55,791
And, finally, a photo of my other
neighbour Damian Popodopolous.

464
00:39:56,063 --> 00:40:00,063
He's a Greek and smells like
lemon dishwashing liquid

465
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:05,470
and his skin is smooth,
like the back of a spoon.

466
00:40:05,689 --> 00:40:11,649
Mum says he's a wog and has a stutter
and can't even say his own surname.

467
00:40:13,649 --> 00:40:17,009
She says you have to hit him
on the back of the head

468
00:40:17,149 --> 00:40:18,468
to get his words out.

469
00:40:18,608 --> 00:40:20,405
P-P-P-P...Popodopolous.

470
00:40:20,566 --> 00:40:24,726
I wish he was my boyfriend
and we can be in love and do sexing

471
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,619
like Katherine Ramsay told me
behind the bike shed.

472
00:40:28,234 --> 00:40:30,914
She said it's when two people
go "nuddy"

473
00:40:31,026 --> 00:40:33,494
and rub on each other to make babies.

474
00:40:34,651 --> 00:40:39,211
I told her she's a liar
and would go to hell and burn like toast

475
00:40:39,402 --> 00:40:42,162
'cos babies really come
from beer glasses

476
00:40:42,277 --> 00:40:46,429
and eggs laid by rabbits
and nuns and "prosti-tubes".

477
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,654
She said ladies get knocked up

478
00:40:48,736 --> 00:40:51,776
and bake babies in their stomachs
for 2 years

479
00:40:51,903 --> 00:40:55,498
till they spurt out their "vag-eye-ners"
with blood and tinned spaghetti.

480
00:40:56,862 --> 00:40:59,982
Have you got a girlfriend, Max,
or some wives?

481
00:41:00,113 --> 00:41:02,553
Have you done sexing?

482
00:41:02,655 --> 00:41:03,975
Valentine's Day is soon

483
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:08,899
and I want to give Damian a present
so he can love me.

484
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:12,239
Can you explain love
and how I can be "lover'd"?

485
00:41:14,656 --> 00:41:18,136
Once again, Mary's letter
had triggered an anxiety attack.

486
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,780
Max knew nothing about love.

487
00:41:21,865 --> 00:41:25,665
It was as foreign to him as scuba diving

488
00:41:25,824 --> 00:41:29,737
and he'd had an appalling history
of getting it all wrong.

489
00:41:30,825 --> 00:41:32,425
One Valentine's Day

490
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:37,486
he'd given Zelda Glutnik a gift
he was sure was appropriate.

491
00:41:43,576 --> 00:41:47,285
The only companion
that had ever warmed Max's bed

492
00:41:47,535 --> 00:41:49,491
was his hot water bottle.

493
00:41:51,244 --> 00:41:52,364
Romance and love

494
00:41:52,411 --> 00:41:55,483
was a mysterious language
he'd given up on.

495
00:41:56,411 --> 00:41:59,491
If only Mary had asked
how a toaster works

496
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:03,020
or asked for an explanation
of the Chaos theory.

497
00:42:03,162 --> 00:42:07,440
If only there was
a mathematical equation for love.

498
00:42:09,246 --> 00:42:12,875
He kept eating and thinking.

499
00:42:28,082 --> 00:42:33,882
But love was not like Max's
Rubik's Cube. It could not be solved.

500
00:42:34,124 --> 00:42:37,514
No matter how he analysed it,
the results were negative.

501
00:42:38,124 --> 00:42:39,884
Beat it, creep!

502
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:43,238
He felt love but couldn't articulate it.

503
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:47,573
Its logic was as foreign to him as...
as a salad sandwich.

504
00:42:50,043 --> 00:42:52,159
The stars made more sense.

505
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:02,580
12, have you responded
to the call? Over.

506
00:43:02,711 --> 00:43:05,951
The anxiety and stress were too much.

507
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:11,922
The inscrutability of love finally won,
and Max's brain gave in.

508
00:43:21,421 --> 00:43:24,821
He was diagnosed
with severe depression and obesity

509
00:43:24,964 --> 00:43:30,322
and spent the next 8 months
institutionalised and bedridden.

510
00:43:30,631 --> 00:43:33,751
They marinated him
in a cocktail of drugs

511
00:43:33,881 --> 00:43:37,396
and performed
the usual "therapeutic" procedures.

512
00:43:42,966 --> 00:43:46,446
Meanwhile, Mary wondered and waited.

513
00:43:48,341 --> 00:43:51,299
Maybe Max's typewriter
had run out of ink.

514
00:43:51,758 --> 00:43:55,148
Maybe America had run out of ink.

515
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:58,193
Maybe his pets had eaten him.

516
00:43:59,593 --> 00:44:01,823
Maybe it was her.

517
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:06,401
Was she too demanding,
too boring, too...ugly?

518
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,508
Filled with anger, confusion
and self-loathing,

519
00:44:18,762 --> 00:44:23,392
Mary tried to erase
the memory of her friend forever.

520
00:45:12,977 --> 00:45:14,171
Max had recovered.

521
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:18,940
And life was balanced, safe
and symmetrical once again.

522
00:45:21,978 --> 00:45:26,298
But Mary still lingered in his mind.

523
00:45:26,478 --> 00:45:29,158
Half of him wanted to write to her
immediately.

524
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:33,590
The other half didn't want to end up
a mental patient again.

525
00:45:33,771 --> 00:45:38,651
At least there was always Mr Ravioli
to be friends with.

526
00:45:38,855 --> 00:45:41,733
He was a much safer option.

527
00:45:42,897 --> 00:45:46,651
He wondered what Mary was doing
right now.

528
00:45:47,773 --> 00:45:50,453
But she was far from content

529
00:45:50,565 --> 00:45:56,401
and struggled on by herself,
saving her money for a rainy day.

530
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:06,310
Life went on as usual for Max

531
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,120
and even though he opted
for order and stability,

532
00:46:10,275 --> 00:46:13,585
misfortune was never far away.

533
00:46:43,029 --> 00:46:46,869
Luckily, his manslaughter charges
were dismissed

534
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:49,870
because he was labelled
mentally deficient

535
00:46:49,988 --> 00:46:54,028
and unlikely to have a motive
for killing a mime artist...

536
00:46:54,197 --> 00:46:55,312
Oop.

537
00:46:55,447 --> 00:46:56,926
..unlike most people.

538
00:46:58,823 --> 00:47:02,303
From then on,
Max cooled himself differently

539
00:47:02,448 --> 00:47:04,848
and things went back to normal

540
00:47:04,949 --> 00:47:10,669
until after his 48th birthday,
when his numbers finally came up.

541
00:47:10,908 --> 00:47:13,228
Welcome
to the New York Lottery

542
00:47:13,325 --> 00:47:15,445
and these are tonight's
winning numbers

543
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:18,693
3, 5,

544
00:47:18,825 --> 00:47:24,545
6, 9,

545
00:47:24,784 --> 00:47:30,495
11 and 12!

546
00:48:12,457 --> 00:48:14,337
Max was sensible
with his sudden wealth

547
00:48:14,415 --> 00:48:17,535
and had bought a lifetime supply
of chocolate

548
00:48:17,666 --> 00:48:20,626
and the complete Noblet collection.

549
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:28,234
Two of his life goals had come true.

550
00:48:28,459 --> 00:48:31,299
But he still had a lot of money

551
00:48:31,417 --> 00:48:33,777
so decided to give it to lvy...

552
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:38,282
..who was also very sensible...

553
00:49:12,131 --> 00:49:16,010
..until her own numbers came up.

554
00:49:24,757 --> 00:49:28,597
Ivy willed everything
to the local cat shelter,

555
00:49:28,758 --> 00:49:33,678
whose owner relocated
her kind donation to his bank account,

556
00:49:33,883 --> 00:49:40,123
his wife's new breasts, a Ferrari
and enough fuel to get to Mexico.

557
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:52,058
Despite achieving all his life's goals,

558
00:49:52,219 --> 00:49:56,539
Max still felt incomplete.

559
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:00,119
Mr Ravioli just wasn't
cutting the mustard anymore

560
00:50:00,262 --> 00:50:05,211
and seemed more interested
in his self-help books.

561
00:50:05,554 --> 00:50:08,794
Mary had given Max
a taste of real friendship

562
00:50:08,929 --> 00:50:12,285
and there was just no comparison.

563
00:50:13,096 --> 00:50:15,176
She missed him too

564
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:18,061
but no longer saved to see him.

565
00:50:19,389 --> 00:50:23,143
She now saved
for a different reason.

566
00:50:33,224 --> 00:50:38,617
One day Mr Ravioli got up,
left and never came back.

567
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:46,170
Max sought Dr Hazelhof's advice.

568
00:50:47,767 --> 00:50:52,647
He told Max that true friendship
is seen through the heart,

569
00:50:52,851 --> 00:50:54,771
not through the eyes,

570
00:50:54,852 --> 00:51:02,532
and that it was time he wrote to Mary
to reveal his true self, warts and all.

571
00:51:02,853 --> 00:51:05,731
Max understood.

572
00:51:23,272 --> 00:51:26,032
Dear Mary Daisy Dinkle,

573
00:51:26,147 --> 00:51:28,615
there is something I have to tell you

574
00:51:28,814 --> 00:51:32,523
which will explain
why I have not written.

575
00:51:32,773 --> 00:51:38,962
Each time I received one of your letters,
I had a severe anxiety attack.

576
00:51:39,315 --> 00:51:43,795
This is because recently,
while I was in a mental institution,

577
00:51:43,983 --> 00:51:50,623
they diagnosed that I have a new thing
called Asperger's syndrome,

578
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:57,940
which is a neurobiological,
pervasive, developmental disability.

579
00:51:58,234 --> 00:52:01,834
I prefer "Aspie" for short.

580
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:05,785
I will now list some of the traits
of an Aspie.

581
00:52:08,444 --> 00:52:13,204
No.1 - I find the world
very confusing and chaotic

582
00:52:13,403 --> 00:52:18,563
because my mind
is very literal and logical.

583
00:52:22,029 --> 00:52:28,184
2 - I have trouble understanding
the expressions on people's faces.

584
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:36,528
When I was younger, I made a book
to help me when I was confused.

585
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:43,049
I still have trouble with some people.

586
00:52:43,323 --> 00:52:46,483
Ivy was hard to understand
because of her wrinkles

587
00:52:46,615 --> 00:52:50,051
and because her eyebrows weren't real.

588
00:52:51,449 --> 00:52:53,769
3 - I have bad handwriting,

589
00:52:53,866 --> 00:52:56,786
am hypersensitive...

590
00:52:56,908 --> 00:52:59,548
..clumsy

591
00:52:59,658 --> 00:53:03,014
and can get very concerned.

592
00:53:06,701 --> 00:53:14,176
4 - I like solving problems.
Ivy said this is a good thing.

593
00:53:17,077 --> 00:53:22,197
And finally No.5 -
I have trouble expressing my emotions.

594
00:53:22,411 --> 00:53:27,411
Dr Bernard Hazelhof says
my brain is defective

595
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:33,100
but one day there will be a cure
for my disability.

596
00:53:33,329 --> 00:53:35,729
I do not like it when he says this.

597
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:40,709
I do not feel disabled, defective
or I need to be cured.

598
00:53:40,913 --> 00:53:43,791
I like being an Aspie.

599
00:53:43,997 --> 00:53:48,070
It would be like trying to change
the colour of my eyes.

600
00:53:50,081 --> 00:53:54,041
There is one thing
I wish I could change, however.

601
00:53:55,915 --> 00:53:58,435
I wish I could cry properly.

602
00:54:01,041 --> 00:54:06,201
I squeeze and squeeze
but nothing...comes out.

603
00:54:06,416 --> 00:54:09,776
I cry when I cut onions
but this does not count.

604
00:54:09,917 --> 00:54:12,717
Anyway, do you like the word
"cumquat"?

605
00:54:12,834 --> 00:54:14,874
It is a type of fruit.

606
00:54:14,959 --> 00:54:17,678
Do you have
a favourite-sounding word?

607
00:54:17,876 --> 00:54:21,636
My top 5 are ointment, bumblebee,

608
00:54:21,793 --> 00:54:25,033
Vladivostok, banana

609
00:54:25,169 --> 00:54:27,046
and testicle.

610
00:54:28,919 --> 00:54:32,832
I have also invented some new words

611
00:54:33,086 --> 00:54:40,197
"confuzzled", which is being confused
and puzzled at the same time,

612
00:54:40,587 --> 00:54:45,183
"snirt", which is a cross between
snow and dirt,

613
00:54:45,463 --> 00:54:47,783
and "smushables"...

614
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:53,360
..which are squashed groceries
you find at the bottom of the bag.

615
00:54:53,589 --> 00:54:57,429
I have sent a letter
to the Oxford Dictionary people

616
00:54:57,589 --> 00:55:00,869
asking them to include my words

617
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:04,203
but I have not heard back.

618
00:55:04,424 --> 00:55:08,664
It is now time for me to go
to my Overeaters Anonymous meeting.

619
00:55:08,841 --> 00:55:12,321
There is a woman there
called Marjorie Buttersworth

620
00:55:12,466 --> 00:55:14,775
who confuzzles me.

621
00:55:14,966 --> 00:55:18,846
She kisses me without my permission

622
00:55:19,009 --> 00:55:25,608
so tonight I have decided to rub onions
under my armpits to repel her.

623
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:30,800
Your friend in America,
Max Jerry Horowitz.

624
00:55:35,552 --> 00:55:37,872
PS. Please find enclosed

625
00:55:37,969 --> 00:55:41,723
some chocolate-covered ants
I found at the deli.

626
00:55:43,137 --> 00:55:47,137
PPS. Not much has happened
since I last wrote

627
00:55:47,304 --> 00:55:53,652
except for my manslaughter charges,
lotto win and lvy's death.

628
00:55:57,305 --> 00:56:00,585
Mary was thrilled
Max had finally written

629
00:56:00,722 --> 00:56:03,442
and suddenly had a fabulous idea.

630
00:56:03,556 --> 00:56:05,433
A-ha!

631
00:56:39,268 --> 00:56:43,068
Mary and Max's friendship
was resuscitated

632
00:56:43,227 --> 00:56:48,267
and her tears were the best gift
he'd ever received.

633
00:56:48,478 --> 00:56:52,630
Inside Max's head
his brain was smiling.

634
00:56:54,395 --> 00:56:56,915
Loaded up with bizarre forms
of chocolate,

635
00:56:57,021 --> 00:57:01,381
their letters flew thick and fast
between the continents.

636
00:57:01,563 --> 00:57:04,843
Max learnt to read Mary's letters
with caution

637
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:08,893
and at the slightest tingle of tension,
he would stop,

638
00:57:09,147 --> 00:57:12,776
take his medication
and soothe his nerves.

639
00:57:13,023 --> 00:57:18,783
Each letter he would iron, laminate
and file in a special place,

640
00:57:19,023 --> 00:57:22,060
which also soothed his nerves.

641
00:57:26,566 --> 00:57:30,957
He enjoyed answering her questions
and solving her puzzles like

642
00:57:31,233 --> 00:57:33,993
Do sheep shrink when it rains?

643
00:57:34,108 --> 00:57:38,028
Why do old men
wear their pants so high?

644
00:57:38,192 --> 00:57:43,352
Do gooses get goosebumps
and why is bellybutton lint blue?

645
00:57:43,568 --> 00:57:45,208
Are there Noblets in heaven?

646
00:57:45,276 --> 00:57:49,876
And if a taxi goes backwards,
does the driver owe you money?

647
00:57:50,069 --> 00:57:55,829
In turn, Mary simply enjoyed
hearing about Max's fascinating life

648
00:57:56,069 --> 00:57:58,424
how many people
he'd counted littering...

649
00:58:04,029 --> 00:58:06,269
..how the latest Henry had died...

650
00:58:15,905 --> 00:58:19,056
..and new recipes he'd invented
for chicken.

651
00:58:22,781 --> 00:58:24,781
Each nourished the other

652
00:58:24,865 --> 00:58:27,665
and, as Mary grew taller,

653
00:58:27,782 --> 00:58:29,742
Max grew wider

654
00:58:29,824 --> 00:58:35,376
their friendship becoming stronger
than the glue on Mary's Noblets.

655
00:58:39,908 --> 00:58:42,748
Although Max found solace in Mary,

656
00:58:42,867 --> 00:58:46,107
he still found the rest of the world
bewildering.

657
00:58:46,242 --> 00:58:48,002
And he couldn't understand

658
00:58:48,076 --> 00:58:51,036
why he was seen as the odd one

659
00:58:51,159 --> 00:58:54,037
while everyone else
was considered normal.

660
00:58:56,035 --> 00:58:59,515
Humans were endlessly illogical.

661
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:04,820
Why did they throw out food when
there were children starving in lndia?

662
00:59:05,036 --> 00:59:09,676
Why did they clear the rainforests
when they needed the oxygen?

663
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:16,470
And why did they create bus timetables
when they never ran on time?

664
00:59:16,746 --> 00:59:23,266
He agreed with his favourite physicist
that there are only two things infinite

665
00:59:23,538 --> 00:59:27,418
the universe and man's stupidity.

666
00:59:29,206 --> 00:59:34,846
And for Mary, even though
Max filled her with confidence...

667
00:59:35,081 --> 00:59:36,041
Bullseye!

668
00:59:36,082 --> 00:59:39,562
..her world was far from perfect.

669
00:59:39,707 --> 00:59:43,097
The grip of love had her by the throat.

670
01:00:03,877 --> 01:00:09,237
At 4.59pm, on the 8th of the 8th 1988...

671
01:00:11,461 --> 01:00:16,021
..Noel Norman Dinkle
attached his last string

672
01:00:16,211 --> 01:00:22,331
and, after 40 years
and 40 million tea bags, he retired.

673
01:00:22,587 --> 01:00:27,507
To celebrate, Noel announced
he was retiring from taxidermy

674
01:00:27,713 --> 01:00:31,433
and taking up metal detecting instead.

675
01:00:31,588 --> 01:00:35,137
But, sadly, it was not a hobby
he had for long.

676
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:15,995
In his will, Noel had left Mary
some money

677
01:01:16,135 --> 01:01:20,970
so she decided to go to university
and study disorders of the mind,

678
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:25,061
yearning to learn more about her friend.

679
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:31,100
Mary was as popular at university
as she was at school.

680
01:01:31,346 --> 01:01:34,706
Damian went there too,
aching to be a Thespian.

681
01:01:34,846 --> 01:01:37,726
Hi there, M-M-Mary.

682
01:01:37,846 --> 01:01:41,395
Hi...hello!

683
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:53,610
That was damn f-f-funny!

684
01:02:24,644 --> 01:02:30,284
Hey, Damian,
your mum's roses look fab!

685
01:02:30,519 --> 01:02:32,999
Oh, th-th-th-thanks, Mary.

686
01:02:33,103 --> 01:02:35,543
Um, M-Mary,
can I tell you something?

687
01:02:35,645 --> 01:02:37,485
Sure, babe!

688
01:02:37,562 --> 01:02:42,556
Um, um, you've got d-d-d-d-dog's poo
on your shoe.

689
01:02:54,939 --> 01:02:56,859
Dear Max,

690
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,859
I have been such an idiot.

691
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:01,380
I've wasted all my money
on something pointless

692
01:03:01,482 --> 01:03:03,359
when I should have been saving
to see you.

693
01:03:05,399 --> 01:03:08,479
I know love upsets you
so I won't go on about it.

694
01:03:08,607 --> 01:03:12,927
All I want to say is that love
is obviously not for me.

695
01:03:13,108 --> 01:03:17,388
I hope you are well and enjoy
the chocolate cigarettes I've enclosed.

696
01:03:17,567 --> 01:03:18,886
Love Mary.

697
01:03:33,652 --> 01:03:36,292
Oh, you should be ashamed!

698
01:03:36,402 --> 01:03:38,632
- Come on, baby. Let's go.
- Oh, Mum...

699
01:03:38,819 --> 01:03:41,891
I told you never to talk to strangers.

700
01:03:50,946 --> 01:03:56,066
Noel's sudden death
had filled Vera with remorse and guilt

701
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:00,671
and she coped
in the only way she knew.

702
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:38,310
Dear Max,

703
01:05:38,376 --> 01:05:41,856
our wedding day was everything
I have ever dreamt,

704
01:05:42,001 --> 01:05:44,921
making up for the terrible year I've had.

705
01:05:47,293 --> 01:05:50,013
Although all the guests
were Damian's family and friends,

706
01:05:50,127 --> 01:05:52,118
I felt very welcome.

707
01:05:55,878 --> 01:06:00,478
Damian is so perfect.
He even made my wedding dress.

708
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:01,950
And for our honeymoon

709
01:06:02,003 --> 01:06:05,359
he took me to Mykonos
his favourite island in Greece.

710
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:07,269
I got to ride a donkey

711
01:06:07,337 --> 01:06:10,857
and found the perfect gift for Len.

712
01:06:11,005 --> 01:06:14,965
Poor Len, he's still struggling
with his agoraphobia.

713
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:18,900
Aaaaahhhh!

714
01:06:23,214 --> 01:06:25,894
Damian and I are so similar.

715
01:06:26,006 --> 01:06:30,045
He even has his own penfriend, who lives
on a sheep farm in New Zealand.

716
01:06:34,007 --> 01:06:35,967
Mary...M-M-M-Mary.

717
01:06:36,049 --> 01:06:38,847
Mary...M-M-M-Mary.

718
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:40,642
Ohhh.

719
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:46,032
Mary was bursting with self-esteem

720
01:06:46,301 --> 01:06:49,181
and her confidence
was almost unbearable.

721
01:06:51,259 --> 01:06:53,899
At university, she shone

722
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:59,164
and took it upon herself
to cure the world of mental illness.

723
01:07:05,845 --> 01:07:09,205
She did her thesis
on Asperger's syndrome

724
01:07:09,345 --> 01:07:13,224
and used Max as her case study.

725
01:07:13,512 --> 01:07:16,072
Her professors
were thoroughly impressed

726
01:07:16,179 --> 01:07:19,899
and her writing praised far and wide.

727
01:07:20,055 --> 01:07:23,575
Soon, publishers queued
to print her unique insight

728
01:07:23,722 --> 01:07:31,042
and by her 25th birthday, thousands
of copies were ready to be shipped.

729
01:07:31,348 --> 01:07:33,108
Dear Max,

730
01:07:33,181 --> 01:07:34,741
I am very proud to give you

731
01:07:34,806 --> 01:07:38,206
the very first copy of my book
about your disability

732
01:07:38,349 --> 01:07:42,581
and the hopes that we have
to one day cure it.

733
01:07:43,724 --> 01:07:44,724
Even more exciting

734
01:07:44,766 --> 01:07:50,284
is that I am finally coming to meet and
celebrate with you in one week's time.

735
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,720
I'm also going to give you
half the royalties.

736
01:07:53,850 --> 01:07:57,170
Your loving friend, Mary.

737
01:07:57,309 --> 01:08:01,666
PS. Please find enclosed
some chocolate-coated Swiss almonds.

738
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:11,130
Max didn't take the news
very well

739
01:08:11,311 --> 01:08:14,191
not very well at all.

740
01:08:14,311 --> 01:08:17,071
Dear Mary Daisy Dinkle,

741
01:08:17,187 --> 01:08:22,347
I cannot express myself
very clearly at this moment

742
01:08:22,562 --> 01:08:28,722
and so I will list my emotions
in the order they feel most intense

743
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:36,300
hurt, confuzzledness, betrayal,
discomfort, distress and wheeziness.

744
01:08:36,606 --> 01:08:39,766
This last one is not really an emotion

745
01:08:39,898 --> 01:08:42,458
but I thought you should know about it
anyway.

746
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:19,229
With her suitcase packed for New York,
Mary said goodbye to Damian.

747
01:09:19,528 --> 01:09:26,928
She hadn't been this excited since
she'd found a Noblet in the gutter.

748
01:09:27,237 --> 01:09:31,477
But her excitement
suddenly dribbled away

749
01:09:31,654 --> 01:09:34,088
Iike a chocolate in the sun.

750
01:10:45,913 --> 01:10:50,384
Mary slowly sank
into a puddle of depression, self-loathing

751
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:52,905
and cooking sherry.

752
01:10:52,997 --> 01:10:58,437
The only colour left in her life
was her beloved Damian,

753
01:10:58,665 --> 01:11:04,425
only an arm's length away
but as distant as the moon.

754
01:11:09,666 --> 01:11:14,946
She lost interest in the world
and it lost interest in her

755
01:11:15,167 --> 01:11:20,047
as a horrible apparition began to haunt.

756
01:11:20,251 --> 01:11:24,411
She started to spend her nights
making pompoms

757
01:11:24,584 --> 01:11:27,894
and eating two-minute noodles.

758
01:12:30,967 --> 01:12:34,277
Each day, with strength and shame,

759
01:12:34,510 --> 01:12:38,550
Mary trudged to the letterbox in hope,

760
01:12:38,718 --> 01:12:43,758
only to swivel, shrivel
and slink back inside.

761
01:13:38,017 --> 01:13:39,937
My dearest Mary,

762
01:13:40,018 --> 01:13:43,215
by the time you read this,
I will be on a plane to New Zealand

763
01:13:43,435 --> 01:13:45,630
to begin a new life.

764
01:13:45,810 --> 01:13:49,730
You probably haven 't even noticed
I'd packed my bags.

765
01:13:49,894 --> 01:13:54,334
I have fallen in love
with my penfriend, Desmond,

766
01:13:54,519 --> 01:13:57,039
and I'm going to live
on his sheep farm.

767
01:13:59,645 --> 01:14:03,125
It's been hard to watch you become
a remnant of the person I once loved.

768
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:06,070
Your research into m-m-mental illness
has been admirable

769
01:14:06,187 --> 01:14:11,347
but your i-idealistic pursuit to remedy it
has been misguided.

770
01:14:11,563 --> 01:14:14,600
Mary, you have to realise y-you are not
a magic beauty cream

771
01:14:14,813 --> 01:14:19,093
you can smooth on the world
to rid it of its wrinkles.

772
01:14:19,272 --> 01:14:21,072
I love you, Mary,

773
01:14:21,148 --> 01:14:24,308
but I love Desmond more.

774
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:27,680
I hope one day your heart will heal
and we can be friends.

775
01:14:27,815 --> 01:14:30,807
Yours compassionately,
Damian.

776
01:14:53,818 --> 01:14:56,578
Aaaarghh!

777
01:14:56,694 --> 01:14:58,814
Dear Mayor Ridiculani,

778
01:14:58,902 --> 01:15:06,822
on Monday I counted 27 people
illegally dropping cigarette butts.

779
01:15:07,153 --> 01:15:09,713
I would like to recommend
the fine be increased

780
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:14,860
to a minimum of $1 million
as a stronger deterrent

781
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:18,268
and would be happy...

782
01:15:51,575 --> 01:15:55,090
Thank you.

783
01:16:38,248 --> 01:16:40,284
Sorry.

784
01:17:00,459 --> 01:17:02,499
Dear Mary,

785
01:17:02,584 --> 01:17:06,864
please find enclosed
my entire Noblet collection

786
01:17:07,043 --> 01:17:10,160
as a sign that I forgive you.

787
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:14,888
When I received your book,
the emotions inside...

788
01:18:11,634 --> 01:18:16,434
On the way home,
Max sat to count the stars.

789
01:18:16,634 --> 01:18:19,154
He felt complete

790
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:22,297
the world was back in balance.

791
01:19:44,145 --> 01:19:49,425
# When I was just a little girl

792
01:19:49,646 --> 01:19:55,357
# I asked my mother, what will I be?

793
01:19:56,772 --> 01:20:02,892
# Will I be pretty, will I be rich?

794
01:20:03,147 --> 01:20:07,347
# Here's what she said to me...

795
01:20:07,523 --> 01:20:13,243
# Que sera sera

796
01:20:13,482 --> 01:20:18,922
# Whatever will be will be

797
01:20:19,149 --> 01:20:24,069
# The future's not ours to see

798
01:20:24,275 --> 01:20:28,791
# Que sera sera

799
01:20:55,154 --> 01:20:59,634
# Que sera sera

800
01:20:59,821 --> 01:21:05,541
# Whatever will be will be

801
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:10,820
# The future's not ours to see

802
01:21:11,031 --> 01:21:15,343
# Que sera sera

803
01:21:16,698 --> 01:21:20,816
# What will be will be

804
01:21:22,907 --> 01:21:26,741
# Que sera sera #

805
01:21:49,202 --> 01:21:50,555
Ah!

806
01:21:50,702 --> 01:21:54,615
Len had saved the day
and after 45 years

807
01:21:54,869 --> 01:21:59,465
he finally conquered his agoraphobia.

808
01:22:03,787 --> 01:22:05,147
Moron!

809
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:16,600
Dear Mary,

810
01:22:16,664 --> 01:22:21,264
please find enclosed
my entire Noblet collection

811
01:22:21,456 --> 01:22:25,376
as a sign that I forgive you.

812
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:29,300
When I received your book,
the emotions inside my brain

813
01:22:29,457 --> 01:22:34,326
felt like they were in a tumble dryer,
smashing into each other.

814
01:22:35,791 --> 01:22:40,031
The hurt felt like when I accidentally
stapled my lips together.

815
01:22:40,208 --> 01:22:41,800
Ow!

816
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:47,320
The reason I forgive you
is because you are not perfect.

817
01:22:47,542 --> 01:22:51,382
You are imperfect, and so am l.

818
01:22:51,543 --> 01:22:54,423
All humans are imperfect,

819
01:22:54,543 --> 01:22:58,695
even the man outside my apartment
who litters.

820
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:05,115
When I was young,
I wanted to be anybody but myself.

821
01:23:05,461 --> 01:23:09,261
Dr Bernard Hazelhof said
if I was on a desert island

822
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:13,020
then I would have to get used
to my own company

823
01:23:13,171 --> 01:23:16,243
just me and the coconuts.

824
01:23:16,504 --> 01:23:22,739
He said I would have to accept myself,
my warts and all,

825
01:23:23,088 --> 01:23:25,928
and that we don't get to choose
our warts.

826
01:23:26,047 --> 01:23:29,517
They are a part of us
and we have to live with them.

827
01:23:31,548 --> 01:23:35,548
We can, however, choose our friends

828
01:23:35,715 --> 01:23:40,835
and I am glad I have chosen you.

829
01:23:41,049 --> 01:23:44,041
Dr Bernard Hazelhof also said

830
01:23:44,258 --> 01:23:48,578
that everyone's lives
are like a very long sidewalk.

831
01:23:48,758 --> 01:23:53,278
Some are well paved.
Others, like mine,

832
01:23:53,467 --> 01:23:58,827
have cracks, banana skins
and cigarette butts.

833
01:23:59,051 --> 01:24:05,729
Your sidewalk is like mine
but probably not as many cracks.

834
01:24:06,094 --> 01:24:09,882
Hopefully, one day
our sidewalks will meet

835
01:24:10,136 --> 01:24:13,606
and we can share
a can of condensed milk.

836
01:24:17,595 --> 01:24:23,591
You are my best friend.
You are my only friend.

837
01:24:23,929 --> 01:24:29,049
Your American penpal,
Max Jerry Horowitz.

838
01:24:30,597 --> 01:24:35,397
PS. I have recently found the perfect job
with a survey company.

839
01:24:35,597 --> 01:24:40,148
All I have to do is eat things
and tick boxes.

840
01:26:02,149 --> 01:26:04,026
Max?

841
01:26:08,108 --> 01:26:10,019
Max?

842
01:26:15,026 --> 01:26:16,505
Max?

843
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:20,237
Hello?

844
01:26:24,027 --> 01:26:26,336
Max, it's us!

845
01:26:26,527 --> 01:26:28,643
We're here!

846
01:26:30,986 --> 01:26:33,625
Oh, Max?

847
01:26:40,112 --> 01:26:44,712
Max had died peacefully
that morning

848
01:26:44,905 --> 01:26:48,864
after finishing his final can
of condensed milk.

849
01:28:00,831 --> 01:28:06,303
You are my best friend.
You are my only friend.

850
01:28:12,165 --> 01:28:17,445
He smelt like liquorice
and old books, she thought to herself,

851
01:28:17,666 --> 01:28:21,186
as tears rolled from her eyes

852
01:28:21,333 --> 01:28:25,087
the colour of muddy puddles.
