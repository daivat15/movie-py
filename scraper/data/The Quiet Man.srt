1
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,276
Well, then... Urrmm, now.

2
00:01:49,081 --> 00:01:51,116
I'll begin at the beginnin'.

3
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,313
A fine, soft day
in the spring it was...

4
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:58,355
...when the train pulled into Castletown,
three hours late as usual...

5
00:01:58,641 --> 00:02:00,712
...and himself got out.

6
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:04,835
He didn't have the look of
an American tourist at all about him...

7
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:09,036
...not a camera on him and, what
was worst, not even a fishing-rod.

8
00:02:10,683 --> 00:02:12,639
Castletown?

9
00:02:19,244 --> 00:02:22,681
- Castletown?
- Could you tell me the way to Inisfree?

10
00:02:22,884 --> 00:02:26,594
Inisfree? Aw, five miles
and maybe a half more.

11
00:02:26,805 --> 00:02:28,875
- Do you see that road over there?
- Yeah.

12
00:02:29,085 --> 00:02:31,416
Don't take that one,
it'll do you no good.

13
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,717
Now, the best road to Inisfree,
and many...

14
00:02:33,926 --> 00:02:38,636
Oh, Inisfree you want. Be savin' your
breath, let me direct the gentleman.

15
00:02:38,846 --> 00:02:40,325
Happen to know the way to Knoghenor?

16
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:44,439
If you knew the way there,
would he be asking the way to Inisfree?

17
00:02:44,646 --> 00:02:47,161
There's many knows Knoghenor
that doesn't know Inisfree.

18
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:50,643
If you'd take the time to study
your country's history, Mr Maloney...

19
00:02:50,847 --> 00:02:54,761
- ...you'd be the first to admit it.
- Don't send the poor man there.

20
00:02:54,968 --> 00:02:57,066
The fishing is finished
there entirely.

21
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:59,167
Tell me, Yank,
what is it that you're after?

22
00:02:59,368 --> 00:03:02,963
- Is it trout or salmon?
- All I want is to get to Inisfree.

23
00:03:03,168 --> 00:03:06,286
Ah, now you're talking sense.
The best fishing in the country.

24
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:10,004
- True.
- Trout as long as your arm.

25
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:14,806
And salmon! The last one I got,
I expected Jonah to pop out of his mouth.

26
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:17,683
Ah, Inisfree.
I'd bring you there myself...

27
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,847
...only I got to drive the train.

28
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:23,964
Hey, was I tellin' you about that trout
I got two summers before last?

29
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:26,811
- At Inisfree?
- Not at all!

30
00:03:27,012 --> 00:03:29,082
At Ballygar,
over the other end of the country.

31
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:33,923
My sister's third young one is living
at Inisfree...

32
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:37,728
...and she'd be only too happy
to show you the road.

33
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:41,973
- No, no, if she was here.
- It's Inisfree the man wants to go to.

34
00:03:42,174 --> 00:03:46,531
- You see that signpost over there?
- What do you know...

35
00:04:01,056 --> 00:04:03,808
Inisfree, this way.

36
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:32,411
I wonder, now,
why a man would go to Inisfree.

37
00:04:56,861 --> 00:05:00,571
- Six foot six?
- Four and a half.

38
00:05:18,304 --> 00:05:21,741
- Cincinnati?
- No, Pittsburgh.

39
00:05:21,945 --> 00:05:24,095
Pi... Pitss...

40
00:05:40,788 --> 00:05:44,575
Don't you remember, Seaneen,
and how it was.

41
00:05:45,627 --> 00:05:50,418
The road led up past the chapel,
and it wound, and it wound...

42
00:05:50,628 --> 00:05:55,020
...and there was the field where
Dan Tobin's bull chased you.

43
00:05:55,229 --> 00:06:00,428
It was a lovely little house,
Seaneen, and the roses!

44
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:06,387
Your father used to tease me about them,
but he was that proud of them, too.

45
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,698
That's nothin'
but a wee humble cottage.

46
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:34,271
That little place across the brook,
that humble cottage. Who owns it now?

47
00:06:34,473 --> 00:06:36,987
The widow Tillane.
Not that she lives there.

48
00:06:37,193 --> 00:06:39,389
- You think she'd sell it?
- I doubt it.

49
00:06:39,594 --> 00:06:42,313
Don't bet on it 'cause I'm buyin' it.

50
00:06:42,514 --> 00:06:46,952
Why... why would a Yankee
from Pittsburgh want to buy it?

51
00:06:47,155 --> 00:06:51,194
I'll tell you why, Michaleen Oge Flynn,
young small Michael Flynn...

52
00:06:51,395 --> 00:06:53,784
...who used to wipe my runny nose
when I was kid.

53
00:06:53,995 --> 00:06:58,353
Because I'm Sean Thornton, and
I was born in that little cottage.

54
00:06:59,396 --> 00:07:02,707
And I've come home,
and home I'm gonna stay.

55
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:06,990
Does that answer your questions
once and for all, you nosy little man?

56
00:07:07,197 --> 00:07:11,475
Seaneen Thornton... The...

57
00:07:12,317 --> 00:07:13,990
And look at you now.

58
00:07:14,198 --> 00:07:17,429
What do they feed you,
all you men who are in Pittsburgh?

59
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:23,713
Steel, and pig-iron furnaces so hot
a man forgets his fear of hell.

60
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:28,436
When you're hard enough,
tough enough... other things.

61
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,909
Other things, Michaleen.

62
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:55,158
Now then, here comes myself,
that's me there, walking.

63
00:07:55,363 --> 00:08:01,883
That tall, saintly-looking man.
Peter Lonergan, parish priest.

64
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:05,678
Good day, Father.
Sean, this is Father Lonergan.

65
00:08:07,044 --> 00:08:10,719
Father, would you believe it?
This is Sean Thornton...

66
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:14,122
...born right here in Inisfree,
home from America.

67
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:17,236
- Hello, Father.
- Ah, yes.

68
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:20,040
I knew your people, Sean.

69
00:08:20,245 --> 00:08:26,401
Your grandfather... He died
in Australia, in a penal colony.

70
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:30,042
And your father,
he was a good man too.

71
00:08:30,246 --> 00:08:33,762
Bad accident, that. And your mother?

72
00:08:33,967 --> 00:08:36,925
She's dead.
America, when I was twelve.

73
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:43,047
I'll remember her in the mass tomorrow.
You'll be there, seven o'clock.

74
00:08:43,247 --> 00:08:45,159
- Sure, I will.
- Good.

75
00:08:45,368 --> 00:08:48,441
Sean, I'd like to have a little word
with Michaleen here.

76
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:51,287
- Sure thing, Father.
- It'll only take a minute.

77
00:08:51,488 --> 00:08:54,686
- It's a little matter...
- Take your time. I'll be up ahead.

78
00:09:57,816 --> 00:10:00,012
(MICHALEEN) Sean!

79
00:10:07,938 --> 00:10:11,977
Hey, is that real?. She couldn't be.

80
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:17,650
Uh, nonsense, man. It's only a mirage
brought on by your terrible thirst.

81
00:10:17,858 --> 00:10:20,578
Come up, Napoleon.

82
00:11:14,905 --> 00:11:18,181
Over here we pronounce it "Co-han".

83
00:12:28,154 --> 00:12:29,667
Good morning.

84
00:12:50,596 --> 00:12:56,035
None of that now. It's a bold,
sinful man you are, Sean Thornton.

85
00:12:56,238 --> 00:12:59,866
Who told you to playing patty fingers
in the Holy Water?

86
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:02,273
- Just being polite, that's all.
- What is this?

87
00:13:02,478 --> 00:13:05,436
Maybe you don't know it's a privilege
only for courting couples...

88
00:13:05,638 --> 00:13:08,072
...and then only
when the banns have been read.

89
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:13,035
And Mary Kate Danaher dippin'
her fingers in as neat as you please.

90
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:17,676
- What did you say her name was?
- Mary Kate Danaher.

91
00:13:17,878 --> 00:13:19,949
And don't be getting
any notions in your head.

92
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:23,708
- Mary Kate...
- Forget it, Sean, forget it.

93
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:26,718
- Put it out of your mind.
- Why? What's the matter?

94
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,071
- She isn't married or anything?
- Married? That one?

95
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,557
Not likely. And her
with her freckles and her temper.

96
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:37,356
Oh, that red head of hers is no lie.

97
00:13:37,561 --> 00:13:41,191
Still, a man might put up with that
but not with her lack of a fortune.

98
00:13:53,283 --> 00:13:57,322
The wealthiest woman in Inisfree
was the widow Tillane.

99
00:13:57,523 --> 00:13:59,958
She had neither chick nor child,
poor soul...

100
00:14:00,164 --> 00:14:03,998
...but she was well-respected
and good to the poor.

101
00:14:05,004 --> 00:14:07,724
- So you were born there, is that it?
- Yes, ma'am.

102
00:14:07,925 --> 00:14:11,156
All Thorntons were born there,
seven generations.

103
00:14:11,365 --> 00:14:14,802
I see. And what is your thought,
Mr Thornton...

104
00:14:15,006 --> 00:14:19,079
...are you planning to turn
White O' Mornin' into a national shrine?

105
00:14:19,286 --> 00:14:22,643
Perhaps charge tuppence a visit
for a guided tour...

106
00:14:22,847 --> 00:14:26,126
...through the cottage where
the Thorntons were born.

107
00:14:26,127 --> 00:14:28,127
Are you a man of such eminence?

108
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:30,080
No, not exactly.

109
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:33,559
My own family has been in Ireland...

110
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,160
...since the Normans came
hundreds of years ago...

111
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:41,045
...but we've seen no reason
to establish monuments or memorials...

112
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:45,367
Look, Mrs Tillane, I'm not talking
about memorials or monuments.

113
00:14:45,569 --> 00:14:50,563
Ever since I was a kid living in
a shack near the slag heaps...

114
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:54,888
...my mother has told me about
Inisfree and White O' Mornin'.

115
00:14:55,091 --> 00:14:59,369
Inisfree has become
another word for heaven to me.

116
00:14:59,571 --> 00:15:04,281
When I quit the... When I decided to come
here, it was with one thought in mind.

117
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:07,324
Inisfree is far from being a heaven,
Mr Thornton.

118
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:11,286
Ma'am, Mr Red Will Danaher
wishes to be announced...

119
00:15:11,492 --> 00:15:14,371
...I mean, Squire Danaher.

120
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:16,564
Watch your muddy boots!

121
00:15:22,614 --> 00:15:25,333
- Mrs Tillane.
- Mr Thornton, from America.

122
00:15:25,534 --> 00:15:27,490
- Aw!
- Boo.

123
00:15:29,175 --> 00:15:31,244
It's him I'm here about, Mrs Tillane.

124
00:15:31,454 --> 00:15:34,015
- (WILL) Is it true?
- Is what true?

125
00:15:34,215 --> 00:15:36,931
That behind me back,
he's trying to steal...

126
00:15:36,932 --> 00:15:38,732
...White O' Mornin'
right from under me nose?

127
00:15:38,935 --> 00:15:41,928
And what concern of yours is this,
Will Danaher?

128
00:15:42,136 --> 00:15:45,492
Concern? Concern enough.

129
00:15:46,176 --> 00:15:48,896
Haven't I made you a fair offer
for that same piece of land?

130
00:15:49,097 --> 00:15:53,568
- And mine, lying right next to yours?
- You may keep your offers.

131
00:15:53,777 --> 00:15:58,805
- Oh, so it's true. You sold it!
- No, I have not.

132
00:16:01,938 --> 00:16:07,093
Oh, I knew it was a dirty lie
the very minute I heard it!

133
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,813
Sure, I said to him...

134
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:13,978
..."Paggy McFarland, I won't believe that
Sarah'd be selling White O' Mornin'".

135
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,051
(WILL) Why, it would be like building
a fence between your land and mine.

136
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:23,892
"And for a stranger to move in", says I.
"What would she be doing that for?"

137
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,820
And us so close to an understanding,
you might say.

138
00:16:27,021 --> 00:16:30,059
- So you told him all that?
- That I did.

139
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:33,777
Down at the pub, I suppose,
in front of all those big ears...

140
00:16:33,982 --> 00:16:37,531
...with pints in their fists
and pipes in their mouths.

141
00:16:37,742 --> 00:16:40,974
You may have the land, Mr Thornton,
for 600 pounds.

142
00:16:41,183 --> 00:16:44,219
- Done!
- No, you can't. 610!

143
00:16:44,422 --> 00:16:47,335
As I remember, you said 700 pounds.

144
00:16:47,543 --> 00:16:51,616
See here, little man... 710!

145
00:16:51,823 --> 00:16:55,294
- How about an even thousand?
- A thousand and...

146
00:16:56,585 --> 00:16:59,181
And... and I'll be saying
good day to you, Mrs Tillane...

147
00:16:59,382 --> 00:17:01,182
...and all here but one.

148
00:17:01,385 --> 00:17:04,343
And I've got you down in my book.

149
00:17:07,706 --> 00:17:09,901
My dad remembers his dad well.

150
00:17:10,106 --> 00:17:13,462
Mike Thornton.
He had shoulders on him like an ox.

151
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,797
I saw him meself this mornin'.

152
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:19,698
A tall, handsome man,
as I was passin' that chapel.

153
00:17:19,907 --> 00:17:23,043
If you'd pass the pub
as fast as you pass the chapel...

154
00:17:23,244 --> 00:17:25,744
...you'd be better off,
little squint.

155
00:17:44,989 --> 00:17:47,629
Just look at them!
Eating me out of house and home.

156
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,789
Get back to the fields!
There's work to be done.

157
00:18:01,392 --> 00:18:05,510
Isn't it a bit early in the day
for the bottle... even for you?

158
00:18:05,712 --> 00:18:08,671
Feeney, get your book out.

159
00:18:11,392 --> 00:18:15,147
Set down the name,
the one Sean Thornton.

160
00:18:16,194 --> 00:18:19,743
Oh, look at me clean floor!
You dirty little...

161
00:18:19,954 --> 00:18:23,868
- Shut your gob.
- Aw, shut you, little man! Here.

162
00:18:24,074 --> 00:18:27,431
Clean it up yourself,
or there will be no dinner tonight!

163
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:34,907
There now! Look now,
you mustn't mind himself this day.

164
00:18:35,116 --> 00:18:38,631
That's all the work you're good for,
you little tattletail.

165
00:18:40,275 --> 00:18:42,864
Feeney, have you written
the name I gave you?

166
00:18:42,865 --> 00:18:44,065
I have.

167
00:18:44,276 --> 00:18:49,830
Well, strike a line through it.
That's for him. Sean Thornton...

168
00:18:50,717 --> 00:18:55,270
So... He bought White O' Mornin'
in spite of you.

169
00:18:59,718 --> 00:19:02,233
Good for widow Tillane.

170
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,587
Pay no attention to her at all!
Take no notice.

171
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,837
You do, and there'll be a fine wake
in this house tonight.

172
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,589
After all, he's got more right
to that land than you have!

173
00:19:22,481 --> 00:19:27,397
He'll regret it to his dying day,
if ever he lives that long.

174
00:19:30,082 --> 00:19:33,077
Will it be all right
if I leave my bags in here?

175
00:19:33,078 --> 00:19:35,078
I imagine they'll be safe enough.

176
00:19:36,123 --> 00:19:41,197
If you see a little guy, Michaleen Flynn,
tell him I'm waiting for him in the bar.

177
00:19:41,403 --> 00:19:44,221
It'll be a pleasure,
especially for Michaleen.

178
00:19:44,222 --> 00:19:45,522
Thanks.

179
00:19:45,723 --> 00:19:48,033
Is there anything
you should like now, Yank?

180
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:54,323
If I think of anything,
I'll let you know.

181
00:20:00,045 --> 00:20:02,685
(BAR IS QUIET)

182
00:20:03,965 --> 00:20:06,116
Evening.

183
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:11,841
Pleasant night.

184
00:20:14,527 --> 00:20:18,839
- I'll try one of those black beers.
- Oh, the porter. Yes, sir.

185
00:20:23,927 --> 00:20:28,923
Sir, will you join me? Matter of fact,
I'd like to buy everybody a drink.

186
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:33,520
I do not believe I heard your name,
tall man.

187
00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:36,244
Thornton. Sean Thornton.

188
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:40,683
And... your father's name?

189
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:45,964
Mike. Michael Thornton.
He used to live here, by the Mornin'.

190
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:50,130
I just bought the place back.
That's why I'm here.

191
00:20:50,331 --> 00:20:55,850
Then your grandfather
would be Ol' Sean Thornton.

192
00:20:56,052 --> 00:20:59,681
- Right.
- Bless his memory.

193
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:02,248
So it's himself you're named after.

194
00:21:02,453 --> 00:21:05,328
Well, now. That being the case...

195
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:08,529
...it is a pleasant evening
and we will have a drink.

196
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:15,729
<i>There was a wild colonial boy</i>

197
00:21:15,934 --> 00:21:19,893
<i>Jack Duggan was his name</i>

198
00:21:20,774 --> 00:21:25,849
<i>He was born and bred in Ireland</i>

199
00:21:26,055 --> 00:21:30,369
<i>In a town called Castlemaine</i>

200
00:21:32,216 --> 00:21:34,366
- Good evening, Father.
- Is the rest of the committee here?

201
00:21:34,575 --> 00:21:36,329
- They're waiting.
- Sorry we're late.

202
00:21:36,537 --> 00:21:41,611
- The fishing was bad, was it?
- Fine lot of time we had for that!

203
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:45,130
- Oh, Michaleen...
- Commandant Forbes.

204
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:49,297
You can forget about the Commandant.
We're at peace now.

205
00:21:49,498 --> 00:21:52,376
Sure, but I haven't given up hope.

206
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:55,454
Your Yankee friend
is waitin' in the bar.

207
00:21:55,455 --> 00:21:57,255
Oh, he's here already...

208
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,927
Wait a minute. Who is he anyway?

209
00:22:00,139 --> 00:22:05,896
He's a nice, quiet, peacelovin' man come
home to Ireland to forget his troubles.

210
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:07,171
Troubles?

211
00:22:07,372 --> 00:22:10,272
Yes, he's a millionaire
like all the Yanks.

212
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,137
But he is eccentric.
Wait till I show you.

213
00:22:16,261 --> 00:22:17,691
What is it?

214
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:20,892
A bag to sleep in.
A sleeper bag they call it.

215
00:22:21,101 --> 00:22:25,857
I'm tellin' you. The sleeper bag...
Wait till I show you how it operates.

216
00:22:26,062 --> 00:22:27,101
Where does it open?

217
00:22:27,102 --> 00:22:28,702
Hurry up,
I have an important appointment.

218
00:22:28,902 --> 00:22:31,018
- Well, open it up!
- Here.

219
00:22:31,222 --> 00:22:35,739
<i>At the early age of sixteen years</i>

220
00:22:35,943 --> 00:22:40,016
<i>He left his native home</i>

221
00:22:40,223 --> 00:22:45,093
<i>And to Australia's sunny shores</i>

222
00:22:45,304 --> 00:22:49,696
<i>He was inclined to roam</i>

223
00:22:49,905 --> 00:22:54,456
<i>He robbed a wealthy squireen</i>

224
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:59,136
<i>All arms he did destroy</i>

225
00:22:59,346 --> 00:23:03,863
<i>A terror to Australia was</i>

226
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:08,857
<i>This wild colonial boy</i>

227
00:23:09,947 --> 00:23:16,421
Sean Thornton, the men of Inisfree
bid you welcome home.

228
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,584
Thank you.

229
00:23:19,268 --> 00:23:23,626
"And the men of Inisfree
bid you welcome home".

230
00:23:24,348 --> 00:23:27,864
- What's wrong with that little speech?
- Oh, you'd be knowin' what.

231
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:39,019
I'm a man from Inisfree,
and the best man.

232
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,185
And I bid no welcome
to a man fool enough...

233
00:23:42,391 --> 00:23:46,669
...to pay 1000 pounds for a bit
of land that isn't worth 200!

234
00:23:46,871 --> 00:23:48,464
True for you, squire.

235
00:23:48,672 --> 00:23:54,907
(MAN) Didn't I hear of someone
named Danaher bid 810?

236
00:23:57,352 --> 00:24:02,791
Get your book out.
Put his name down: Dermot Fahy.

237
00:24:02,993 --> 00:24:07,111
F-A-H-Y.
No e's, Squireen Danaher.

238
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:08,986
If you were half the man
you think you are...

239
00:24:09,194 --> 00:24:12,504
...you wouldn't begrudge a Thornton
the right to his birthplace.

240
00:24:12,714 --> 00:24:14,890
What right has he to a land
he's never worked?

241
00:24:14,891 --> 00:24:16,391
It's Thornton land, isn't it?

242
00:24:16,595 --> 00:24:19,905
- You've too much of your own as it is.
- Quiet, if you please.

243
00:24:20,115 --> 00:24:24,188
Parliamentary procedure.
Squire Danaher has the floor.

244
00:24:24,395 --> 00:24:27,354
If I had the floor...

245
00:24:28,396 --> 00:24:31,513
- ...I'd hit that big ape with it.
- Hold on.

246
00:24:31,716 --> 00:24:34,789
I don't blame Mr Danaher for gettin'
on his ear.

247
00:24:34,997 --> 00:24:39,309
Who's on his ear? Why, you and ten like
you couldn't put a Danaher on his ear.

248
00:24:39,517 --> 00:24:42,510
- It's just a way of speaking...
- Mind your ways, then.

249
00:24:42,718 --> 00:24:45,190
The point is, it's already done.

250
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:48,191
I own the property now,
and since we're neighbours...

251
00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:50,753
Neighbours? Neighbours...

252
00:24:52,037 --> 00:24:53,438
Never!

253
00:24:53,639 --> 00:24:58,076
And if I so much as catch you putting
one foot on my property, I... I...

254
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:02,512
And, oh, another thing. You keep
away from my sister Mary Kate.

255
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,790
She's not for the likes of you.

256
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,199
Where I come from, we don't talk
about our womenfolk in saloons.

257
00:25:09,402 --> 00:25:12,518
You sort of make a habit of it.
This morning it was widow Tillane.

258
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:13,774
What's that?

259
00:25:13,775 --> 00:25:16,875
That's true.
It's ashamed you should be.

260
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:21,314
Hey, look, I'm not accusing Mary Kate.
It's him.

261
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:25,117
Why, this very moment,
let him deny it if he can.

262
00:25:25,322 --> 00:25:28,679
At the back of the chapel, he took
liberties that he shouldn't have.

263
00:25:28,883 --> 00:25:32,080
- I said "good morning" to her.
- Good morning?

264
00:25:32,283 --> 00:25:34,356
It was "good night"
you had on your mind.

265
00:25:34,357 --> 00:25:35,357
That's a lie.

266
00:25:35,564 --> 00:25:37,395
(MUSIC STOPS)

267
00:25:38,484 --> 00:25:41,044
- That's a what?
- I said "that's a lie".

268
00:25:42,965 --> 00:25:47,117
That's a word I take from no man!
Put up your fists.

269
00:25:47,325 --> 00:25:49,681
- I'm not gonna fight you.
- But I'm gonna...

270
00:25:52,405 --> 00:25:54,203
Thank you.

271
00:25:56,686 --> 00:25:59,883
(FATHER) Danaher!
What's the matter with you?

272
00:26:00,086 --> 00:26:03,045
(FORBES) He's drunk!
Feeney, take him home, will you.

273
00:26:03,247 --> 00:26:05,886
(FEENEY)
Don't soil your knuckles on the man.

274
00:26:06,086 --> 00:26:08,727
- Come on, what do you say?
- Never.

275
00:26:08,928 --> 00:26:11,566
Take the man's hand, or I'll read
your name on a mass on Sunday.

276
00:26:11,767 --> 00:26:14,805
- (FEENEY) Take it.
- I'd join the Church of Ireland first.

277
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:19,399
As if they'd have you.
Shake his hand like I tell you.

278
00:26:19,608 --> 00:26:22,726
- (FEENEY) Come on, come on.
- Shake hands?

279
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:35,086
It's a good grip you have. I always
hated a flappy handshake myself.

280
00:26:44,371 --> 00:26:46,806
Father Paul!

281
00:26:47,012 --> 00:26:51,563
Michaleen, introduce me to this quiet,
peacelovin' man of yours.

282
00:26:51,772 --> 00:26:55,129
I have a strange notion
we're going to be friends, Yank.

283
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:58,962
Give me a minute. Just let
some blood run back into this.

284
00:26:59,173 --> 00:27:05,886
Sean Thornton... His grandfather, a grand
man he was, was hung in Australia.

285
00:27:06,094 --> 00:27:11,532
I could tell you blood-curdlin' stories
about him, but me throat...

286
00:27:11,734 --> 00:27:14,374
(SEAN) All right, come on.

287
00:27:15,495 --> 00:27:20,490
<i>He was born and bred in Ireland</i>

288
00:27:20,696 --> 00:27:25,247
<i>In a town called Castlemaine</i>

289
00:27:25,456 --> 00:27:30,372
<i>He was his father's only son</i>

290
00:27:30,577 --> 00:27:35,207
<i>His mother's pride and joy</i>

291
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:40,367
<i>And dearly did his parents love</i>

292
00:27:40,578 --> 00:27:43,457
<i>This wild colonial boy</i>

293
00:28:34,224 --> 00:28:39,173
Are you sure you won't change your mind,
and come around home with me?

294
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:43,094
Don't worry about it.
I've got my sleeping bag, haven't I.

295
00:28:43,946 --> 00:28:47,062
Well, it's a nice, soft night.

296
00:28:47,265 --> 00:28:51,976
So, I think I'll join my comrades,
and talk a little treason.

297
00:28:52,786 --> 00:28:55,347
- Good night, Sean.
- Good night, Michaleen.

298
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:57,301
(MICHALEEN) God bless you.

299
00:30:26,197 --> 00:30:28,916
(SEAN YELLS)

300
00:30:30,518 --> 00:30:31,836
(MARY KATE SCREAMS)

301
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,033
So bold one you are.
Who gave you leave to be kissin' me?

302
00:31:01,241 --> 00:31:04,677
- So you can talk?
- Yes, I can, I will, and I do.

303
00:31:04,881 --> 00:31:07,442
It's more than talk you'll be gettin'
if you step closer.

304
00:31:07,642 --> 00:31:11,192
- Don't worry. You've got a wallop.
- You'll get over it, I'm thinkin'.

305
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:15,555
Some things a man doesn't get over
so easily.

306
00:31:15,763 --> 00:31:18,356
Like what supposin'?

307
00:31:18,562 --> 00:31:23,797
Like the sight of a girl coming through
the fields, with the sun on her hair.

308
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:28,553
Kneeling in church,
with a face like a saint.

309
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:29,954
Saint, indeed.

310
00:31:30,165 --> 00:31:33,999
And now, coming to a man's house
to clean it for him.

311
00:31:34,205 --> 00:31:37,515
But... that was just my way
of bein' a good Christian act.

312
00:31:37,726 --> 00:31:41,765
I know it was, Mary Kate Danaher,
and it was nice of you.

313
00:31:45,286 --> 00:31:47,481
Not at all.

314
00:33:00,855 --> 00:33:04,563
- Hello.
- Good morning, Mr Thornton.

315
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,926
- How are you, Fa... Doctor...
- No, no. Mr.

316
00:33:08,135 --> 00:33:11,844
And on formal occasions,
the Reverend Mr Playfair.

317
00:33:12,055 --> 00:33:13,808
And this is Mrs Playfair.

318
00:33:14,016 --> 00:33:18,487
(MRS PLAYFAIR) Well, Mr Thornton.
You are a wonder.

319
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:24,852
It looks the way all the Irish cottages
should... and so seldom do.

320
00:33:25,057 --> 00:33:29,609
And only an American
would have thought of emerald green.

321
00:33:29,818 --> 00:33:34,973
- Red is more durable.
- And the roses! How nice.

322
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:41,129
You'll need lots of horse manure.
Fertiliser, I mean. Horse is the best.

323
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:47,575
Oh, I brought you a plant. You know,
"a primrose by a river's brink".

324
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:52,012
"Brim", not "brink".
The next line ends in "hymn".

325
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:56,851
Poets are so silly, aren't they?
Oh, I hope you're not one, Mr Thornton.

326
00:33:57,061 --> 00:34:00,212
- Oh no, ma'am, I...
- Thornton.

327
00:34:01,341 --> 00:34:03,572
There's a familiar ring to it.

328
00:34:06,023 --> 00:34:09,459
Ring to it... Thornton...

329
00:34:10,703 --> 00:34:14,378
It's a common name. Thank you
for the plant, Mrs Playfair...

330
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:17,973
...this is damn... darn...
awfully nice of you.

331
00:34:19,143 --> 00:34:21,180
Oh?

332
00:34:36,226 --> 00:34:39,423
It's a bed. Excuse me.

333
00:34:42,386 --> 00:34:43,474
Morning.

334
00:34:43,475 --> 00:34:46,175
(MAN) That's a fine big bed,
Mr Thornton.

335
00:34:46,386 --> 00:34:49,026
Biggest one I could find.

336
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:06,625
Is that a bed or a parade ground?

337
00:35:06,829 --> 00:35:10,869
Oh, a man'd have to be a sprinter
to catch his wife in a bed like that.

338
00:35:22,231 --> 00:35:24,426
(HORSE WHINNIES)

339
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,222
Whoa!

340
00:35:46,073 --> 00:35:51,990
Mr Flynn... And what are you
all dressed up for, Michaleen Oge?

341
00:35:55,114 --> 00:35:57,265
I ha...

342
00:36:02,516 --> 00:36:06,509
- I have come...
- Oh, I can see that.

343
00:36:06,716 --> 00:36:10,232
- But from whose pub was it?
- P... pub?

344
00:36:11,357 --> 00:36:16,477
You've a tongue like an adder.
I go about me own business...

345
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:21,035
...and tell Thorn Seanton
he's well off without you.

346
00:36:21,237 --> 00:36:24,786
Wait a minute. What was that?

347
00:36:24,997 --> 00:36:30,278
Well, if you listened and not
be interruptin' the matchmaker.

348
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:36,995
I have come...

349
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,035
- ...at the request of Thorn Seanton...
- Sean Thornton.

350
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,912
Shut up.

351
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,597
...bachelor,
and party of the first part...

352
00:36:52,441 --> 00:36:58,437
...to ask of you,
strictly and formally, here...

353
00:36:59,242 --> 00:37:03,521
...Mary Kate Danaher, spinster...

354
00:37:04,403 --> 00:37:06,711
...and party to the second part...

355
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:13,959
Well?. Go on, you were sayin'?

356
00:37:14,163 --> 00:37:20,479
Me mouth is like a dry crust, and
the sun is that hot, and me pate...

357
00:37:20,684 --> 00:37:23,153
Would you be steppin'
into the parlour?

358
00:37:23,365 --> 00:37:28,962
The house may belong to my brother,
but what's in the parlour belongs to me.

359
00:37:29,165 --> 00:37:34,559
I will then, and I hope there's
a bottle there, whoever it belongs to.

360
00:37:34,766 --> 00:37:36,563
It could be.

361
00:37:45,807 --> 00:37:48,800
You have a fine, steady hand.

362
00:38:03,169 --> 00:38:05,603
To good bargaining.

363
00:38:11,371 --> 00:38:13,201
To resume:...

364
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:15,561
- ...the party of the first part...
- That's him.

365
00:38:15,771 --> 00:38:22,085
...has instructed me to enquire before
enterin' into formal negotiations...

366
00:38:22,292 --> 00:38:24,488
...whether the party
to the second part...

367
00:38:24,489 --> 00:38:25,489
That's me.

368
00:38:25,691 --> 00:38:32,131
...thinks kindly of the general idea,
or in his own words... American, eh...

369
00:38:32,772 --> 00:38:36,464
...eh, yes, he wants
to know if you go for it.

370
00:38:36,465 --> 00:38:37,365
Go for it?

371
00:38:37,373 --> 00:38:41,268
And if you do,
he'll speak to your brother.

372
00:38:41,369 --> 00:38:42,369
That won't be easy.

373
00:38:42,574 --> 00:38:44,610
Oh, as well I know it.

374
00:38:44,814 --> 00:38:49,889
He'd as soon put his fist into my teeth
as bid me the time of the day.

375
00:38:51,255 --> 00:38:55,806
What did Sean... the party of
the first part, say about my fortune?

376
00:38:56,015 --> 00:38:58,688
He says he doesn't give it...

377
00:39:00,215 --> 00:39:03,652
He says it's a matter of
complete indifference to him.

378
00:39:03,856 --> 00:39:08,169
- He did?
- He says he doesn't give a sh...

379
00:39:08,377 --> 00:39:12,846
He says it's all one to him if you
come in the clothes on your back...

380
00:39:12,947 --> 00:39:14,647
...or without them.

381
00:39:19,137 --> 00:39:22,414
Oh, he did, did he? Well.

382
00:39:22,618 --> 00:39:24,609
A fine opinion
he must have of me...

383
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:27,410
...if he thinks I'd go to any man
without a proper fortune.

384
00:39:27,619 --> 00:39:30,896
And this you may tell
your Mr Party of the first part:...

385
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:35,571
...when I wed,
whatever's my own, goes with me.

386
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,372
Get up, little man.

387
00:39:45,781 --> 00:39:47,737
And all this furniture is mine.

388
00:39:47,941 --> 00:39:51,900
And I have that china, and linen, and
50 pounds in gold my father left me...

389
00:39:52,101 --> 00:39:57,461
...and my mother's rings, brooches,
my grandmother's veil, her silver comb...

390
00:39:58,223 --> 00:40:01,302
Thirty pounds odd in notes
and silver...

391
00:40:01,303 --> 00:40:04,903
...I've earned these past 15 years,
that's all.

392
00:40:06,383 --> 00:40:11,855
You're a well propertied woman.
I wouldn't mind marryin' you meself.

393
00:40:14,904 --> 00:40:18,215
Eh, where'd you leave the bottle?

394
00:40:21,746 --> 00:40:26,739
And I'd have you tell him, that I'm no
pauper to be going to him in my shift.

<i>Lo, young May moon is beamin' love</i>

399
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:06,343
- You know "The Peter And The Ghost"?
- I do not.

400
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,146
Neither do I.

401
00:41:08,147 --> 00:41:11,147
Could you use a little water
in your whiskey?

402
00:41:11,351 --> 00:41:17,587
When I drink whiskey, I drink whiskey,
and when I drink water, I drink water.

403
00:41:17,792 --> 00:41:20,625
Back to business now.

404
00:41:20,832 --> 00:41:25,348
What answer will I give Sean Thornton,
Mary Kate Danaher?

405
00:41:25,552 --> 00:41:29,023
Well, you can tell him
from me that...

406
00:41:32,713 --> 00:41:35,273
...that I go for it.

409
00:42:00,076 --> 00:42:02,750
- How do I look?
- You look fine.

410
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:27,075
- Hey, what do I say?
- I'll do all the talkin'.

411
00:42:27,279 --> 00:42:29,371
And I'm suppose to stand here
like a dummy?

412
00:42:29,372 --> 00:42:31,372
Shh, now.

413
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:42,590
- Will, there's someone coming to call.
- Who?

414
00:42:42,801 --> 00:42:45,032
It's... well...

415
00:42:45,241 --> 00:42:49,474
It's Michaleen Oge Flynn,
and there's a gentleman with him.

416
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:54,721
Here, Will, put on your coat.

417
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:59,075
Will Danaher,
they're comin' to the front door.

418
00:42:59,283 --> 00:43:02,400
Since when has the back door
been not good enough?

419
00:43:11,565 --> 00:43:13,038
(MICHALEEN)
God bless all in this house.

420
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:14,239
(SEAN) Good evening.

421
00:43:14,445 --> 00:43:17,643
(MICHALEEN) Miss Danaher,
we'd like a word with your brother.

422
00:43:19,285 --> 00:43:22,403
Come on in so, and welcome.

423
00:43:23,286 --> 00:43:25,880
Easy now!

424
00:43:31,607 --> 00:43:38,320
Mr Sean Thornton, bachelor,
meet Miss Mary Kate Danaher, spinster.

425
00:43:39,407 --> 00:43:45,597
Miss Danaher, meet Mr Thornton
from Pittsburgh, Massachusetts, USA.

426
00:43:46,168 --> 00:43:49,127
- Good evening, Miss Danaher.
- This...

427
00:43:51,249 --> 00:43:53,080
This way, please.

428
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:05,325
- Eh, this is my brother...
- Leave the room.

429
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:08,648
- But...
- I said, leave the room.

430
00:44:08,851 --> 00:44:13,083
- Yes, Will.
- Sit down, that's what chairs are for.

431
00:44:13,291 --> 00:44:18,889
- If you've come for supper, you're late.
- Gracious invitation, but thank you, no.

432
00:44:19,852 --> 00:44:23,368
I don't suppose
there's a drop in the house.

433
00:44:23,573 --> 00:44:24,847
Help yourself to the buttermilk.

434
00:44:24,848 --> 00:44:28,348
Buttermilk?
The Borgias would do better.

435
00:44:28,853 --> 00:44:34,804
We'll come with your permission
to the object of this visit.

436
00:44:35,014 --> 00:44:41,807
You've noticed, I presume, that
I'm wearin' my official black coat.

437
00:44:42,015 --> 00:44:45,325
I have. For your dead friend here.

438
00:44:46,535 --> 00:44:48,925
(WILL) I need no trouble
to arrange any marriages for me.

439
00:44:49,136 --> 00:44:55,132
I see. You've been making fine progress
with widow Tillane in the last ten years.

440
00:44:55,336 --> 00:44:57,726
- Is that what you've come to talk about?
- I have not.

441
00:44:57,937 --> 00:45:00,612
I've come to talk
about your sister and him.

442
00:45:00,613 --> 00:45:01,613
Aw, get out.

443
00:45:01,817 --> 00:45:05,527
If he was the last man on the face
of the earth, I'd still say no.

444
00:45:05,737 --> 00:45:07,192
Now just a minute.

445
00:45:07,193 --> 00:45:09,493
If it's a question
of the girl's fortune...

446
00:45:09,698 --> 00:45:13,976
Why, if it'd be a shilling piece
he wanted with her...

447
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:17,615
- ...I'd still say no.
- Come on, Michaleen. I told you so.

448
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:21,368
- I'll explain it to her myself.
- Hey, Yank, I'll count three.

449
00:45:21,579 --> 00:45:24,697
If you're not out of the house
by then, I'll loose the dogs on you.

450
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:30,259
If you say three,
you'll never hear the man count ten.

451
00:45:42,342 --> 00:45:47,814
- Oh, Mary Kate, we tried.
- We'll see him again some other time.

452
00:45:51,783 --> 00:45:55,537
I thank you anyway,
Sean Thornton, for the asking.

453
00:45:55,743 --> 00:46:00,864
You don't think this changes anything?
It's what you say that counts, not him.

454
00:46:01,064 --> 00:46:03,419
Now, now, Sean.
You've gone too far, that's enough.

455
00:46:03,624 --> 00:46:08,221
Say, what is this?
We're gonna get married, aren't we?

456
00:46:18,626 --> 00:46:22,301
- I don't get it.
- This is Ireland, Sean, not America.

457
00:46:22,506 --> 00:46:26,162
Without her brother's consent
she couldn't, and wouldn't.

458
00:46:26,163 --> 00:46:28,263
I'm sorry for both of you.

459
00:47:02,231 --> 00:47:08,340
Those were the bad days. Sean with a face
as dark as the black hunter he rode.

460
00:47:08,553 --> 00:47:10,827
A fine, ill-tempered pair they were.

461
00:47:11,032 --> 00:47:13,751
It was only a matter of time before
one or the other broke his neck.

462
00:47:13,952 --> 00:47:16,262
We knew things
couldn't go on this way.

463
00:47:23,714 --> 00:47:26,466
Easy, Sean!

464
00:47:37,196 --> 00:47:40,267
Hello, Mary Kate... Danaher.

465
00:47:41,156 --> 00:47:44,671
Good morning, Sean Thornton.

466
00:47:53,396 --> 00:47:55,865
So, we formed a little conspiracy.

467
00:47:56,077 --> 00:47:58,156
The Reverend Mr and Mrs Playfair...

468
00:47:58,157 --> 00:48:02,457
...Michaleen Oge and,
saints forgive us, myself.

469
00:48:03,638 --> 00:48:09,077
And on the day of the Inisfree Races,
we sprung the trap on Red Will Danaher.

470
00:48:46,202 --> 00:48:48,956
Remember, you make your speed
when you hit the water.

471
00:48:49,163 --> 00:48:52,394
- Yes, father.
- And ride carefully, my son.

472
00:48:52,603 --> 00:48:54,002
Yes, mum.

473
00:48:54,203 --> 00:48:56,195
Thornton, no silks.

474
00:48:56,404 --> 00:48:58,872
- Your colours, Thornton.
- Thank you.

475
00:49:19,406 --> 00:49:21,398
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

476
00:49:29,408 --> 00:49:34,402
Ladies, gentlemen,
your attention, please!

477
00:49:34,608 --> 00:49:37,681
Will all the lovely ladies...

478
00:49:37,889 --> 00:49:42,565
...who are putting up their bonnets
for the Inisfree Cup...

479
00:49:42,769 --> 00:49:47,001
...please place their bonnets
on the finishing line.

480
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:51,039
Ladies, your bonnets, please!

481
00:49:51,651 --> 00:49:55,803
- Will you not be putting up your bonnet?
- Indeed, I will not.

482
00:49:56,011 --> 00:49:58,241
- No?
- No!

483
00:50:08,252 --> 00:50:11,131
Okay, Michaleen, the widow's bonnet.

484
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:17,648
Will all the gentlemen riders
please go to the starting line.

485
00:50:18,334 --> 00:50:20,972
All riders, please.

486
00:50:21,173 --> 00:50:27,613
Crown at 20 to 1 on the Yank.
I'm given 20 to 1 on the Yank...

487
00:50:28,774 --> 00:50:33,054
I'm given 30 to 1...
40 to 1 on Danaher.

488

Flynn!

489
00:50:35,255 --> 00:50:39,049
If you've done any matchmaking
between Thornton and my widow...

490
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:40,650
...I'll put you in me pocket.

491
00:50:40,856 --> 00:50:43,108
Ah, so you've heard?

492
00:50:43,109 --> 00:50:46,409
Father, what sort of
a scoundrel is this Yank?

493
00:50:46,616 --> 00:50:49,609
One minute it's me sister,
and the next it's herself.

494
00:50:49,817 --> 00:50:51,774
Well, blame no one but yourself.

495
00:50:51,978 --> 00:50:56,335
If you'd saved me as your matchmaker,
you would've been married long since.

496
00:50:56,538 --> 00:51:00,451
- True, Will, true.
- I'm not saying it's too late yet.

497
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:06,255
- What do you mean?
- Why has the widow stood you up so long?

498
00:51:06,458 --> 00:51:08,734
- You're a fine looking man.
- I am.

499
00:51:08,939 --> 00:51:12,375
- A rich, propertied man.
- And well she knows it.

500
00:51:12,579 --> 00:51:16,812
- Father, will I tell him?
- Go ahead, Michaleen.

501
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:20,569
What woman would come into a house
with another woman in it?

502
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:25,377
If you got rid of Mary Kate,
the widow would be in like a shot.

503
00:51:25,581 --> 00:51:26,600
No.

504
00:51:26,601 --> 00:51:29,701
Yes. You had your chance
and you flubbed it.

505
00:51:29,902 --> 00:51:33,531
You refused Seaneen Thornton,
and he reneged on you.

506
00:51:33,742 --> 00:51:39,533
Now, I doubt if he'd take your sister
if you put 1000 pounds on her.

507
00:51:39,742 --> 00:51:40,834
Father Lonergan?

508
00:51:40,935 --> 00:51:44,135
Well, I can't say it's true,
and I won't say it's not.

509
00:51:44,343 --> 00:51:48,019
- But there's been talk.
- Oh, a lot of talk.

510
00:51:48,223 --> 00:51:50,135
A lot of talk, eh?

511
00:51:50,344 --> 00:51:53,893
Two women in the house,
and one of them a redhead.

512
00:51:55,905 --> 00:51:58,158
Two women.

513
00:52:04,546 --> 00:52:08,255
Three Our Fathers,
and three Hail Marys.

514
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:18,022
Morning, Mary Kate.
Morning, children.

Don't sit there gawking.
You're gonna put up your bonnet.

- I will do no such shameless thing.
- You will.

517
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:44,543
I will not!

518
00:53:09,873 --> 00:53:13,183
No bonnet, Mary Kate? What a pity.

519
00:53:44,037 --> 00:53:46,346
Betting will now stop...

520
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:50,996
...and the sale of all intoxicating
and alcoholic drinks will cease.

521

Look at that crazy Danaher!

526

Wouldn't it be wonderful
if he broke his neck?

527
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,004
Maybe he will now, God willing.

528

keep it under your hat. Forget it.

- Well, eh, that depends.

- 350, and not another penny.

and the talkin' under me own eyes.

so many rock walls in this country.

01:27:04,145 --> 01:27:07,341
(MARY KATE) Roses!
Are you plantin' roses?

749
01:27:07,544 --> 01:27:10,058
- Yeah.
- A fine farmer you are.

750
01:27:10,264 --> 01:27:13,494
- Not a turnip, or a potato in the field.
- Or children.

(ROOSTER CROWS)

752
01:27:24,622 --> 01:27:26,976
Sorry.

753
01:27:30,781 --> 01:27:36,173
Well, I... I suppose they'll make
a very fine display around the cottage.

754
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:41,769
- It is a pretty cottage, isn't it?
- I think so.

755
01:27:55,457 --> 01:27:57,766
Let's see now.

756
01:27:57,977 --> 01:28:02,686
We need a plough, and a cultivator,
and seed for planting.

757
01:28:02,896 --> 01:28:06,332
About a horse for the ploughing...
We could sell that hunter of yours.

758
01:28:06,536 --> 01:28:11,086
I'll buy another horse for the ploughing.
Why not a tractor?

759
01:28:11,295 --> 01:28:17,051
Oh, a tractor... Nasty, smelly things.
Besides, they're an awful price.

760
01:28:17,254 --> 01:28:22,202
- With a horse, you get other advantages.
- Yeah. For the roses.

761
01:28:23,253 --> 01:28:25,005
Roses, again.

762
01:28:26,573 --> 01:28:29,006
You...

763
01:28:32,692 --> 01:28:35,922
We could do our shopping
in Castletown...

764
01:28:36,131 --> 01:28:39,680
...and if we put a good foot under us,
we'd be back by suppertime.

765
01:28:39,891 --> 01:28:42,324
- Five miles!
- Well, that's just a...

766
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:45,283
Good stretch of the legs, huh?

767
01:28:47,490 --> 01:28:50,765
All right, get on your walking shoes.

768
01:28:55,848 --> 01:28:58,316
I'll be a minute.

01:29:27,604 --> 01:29:31,152
Why, it's beautiful!
Did you ever see...

773
01:29:31,363 --> 01:29:32,795
It looks like it could fly.

774
01:29:32,796 --> 01:29:35,396
Only one horsepower,
but it's all yours.

775
01:29:36,402 --> 01:29:39,474
- Mine?
- Sure. Think you can drive it?

776

Hold on to your hat!

Let's have another pint.
I'm buying this one.

779
01:30:59,005 --> 01:31:00,505
High time.

780
01:31:01,310 --> 01:31:04,586
- What's that?
- I said, that's fine, squire.

781
01:31:06,029 --> 01:31:08,338
Good health to you all.

782
01:31:10,029 --> 01:31:13,623
- Look, he sold the crossbreds.
- The what?

783
01:31:13,708 --> 01:31:15,699
- The sheep he's been planning on.
- Oh.

784
01:31:15,828 --> 01:31:19,422
Hurry, now is a good time to ask him.
Well, go on.

785
01:31:19,587 --> 01:31:22,704
- Ask him what?
- About my money.

786
01:31:22,827 --> 01:31:24,783
He can't say that
he hasn't got it with him now.

787
01:31:25,027 --> 01:31:28,814
Can't you understand that
I didn't marry you for your fortune?

788
01:31:29,026 --> 01:31:31,202
I don't give...
a hang about the money.

789
01:31:31,203 --> 01:31:34,703
But he does!
That's the whole point of it.

790
01:31:34,785 --> 01:31:39,535
- Now will you go and ask him?
- No. Why shame ourselves?

791
01:31:39,664 --> 01:31:45,614
Shame? The shame's on you, not on me.
Or on me too, if I married a coward.

792
01:31:47,223 --> 01:31:49,100
Is that what you think of me?

793
01:31:49,223 --> 01:31:51,691
What else if you let him rob you
out of my money?

794
01:31:51,783 --> 01:31:57,732
Money! I'm sick of the talk of it. Is
that all you Danahers think about? Money?

Father,
could I... tell you in the Irish?

803
01:34:00,701 --> 01:34:02,001
Hush, hush.

for 10 years!

813
01:35:01,835 --> 01:35:02,835
Keep his head up.

- There's that beauty, that...
- Keep his head up. Keep a tight line.

Maybe they'll do it again.

- Yeah.

Since you know who I am... or was,
you know why I don't want any fighting.

867
01:39:54,872 --> 01:39:58,420
Yes, I was reading about it again
this evening.

Some men collect butterflies,
some stamps.

My hobby's always been
sporting events.

870
01:40:05,510 --> 01:40:07,546
There it is.

It's a very understandable reaction.

01:40:21,228 --> 01:40:26,426
The papers all say it was an accident.
Just one of those things.

880
01:40:45,104 --> 01:40:49,939
I didn't go in there to outbox him.
I went there to beat his brains out.

881
01:40:50,144 --> 01:40:54,694
To drive him into the canvas,
to murder him. That's what I did.

For what? Purse, a piece of the gate.

Lousy money.

And now money
is behind your trouble with Danaher.

They think I'm afraid of fighting.
All the friends I've made, even my wife.

- Well, aren't you in a way?
- Did you ever kill a man?

Well, I have, and all this talk
about her big fortune...

888
01:41:25,459 --> 01:41:27,847
It's not that important.

889
01:41:29,058 --> 01:41:31,288
Perhaps it is to her.

890
01:41:32,498 --> 01:41:37,093
It must be strange to you
from America...

891
01:41:37,297 --> 01:41:41,767
...but it's an old, old custom here,
and believe me, it's a good custom.

892
01:41:41,976 --> 01:41:44,854
The fortune means more to her
than just the money.

893
01:41:45,056 --> 01:41:48,934
Not to me, it isn't.
Not worth fighting for.

894
01:41:49,135 --> 01:41:52,844
- Is your wife's love worth fighting for?
- I don't know.

895
01:41:54,454 --> 01:42:01,454
All I know is that... I won't fight,
unless I'm mad enough to kill...

896
01:42:01,733 --> 01:42:05,442
...and if that means losin' her...
I don't know.

897
01:42:06,293 --> 01:42:10,604
- Maybe she doesn't love me enough.
- It's a difficult situation.

898
01:42:12,012 --> 01:42:15,526
I think you'll find the right answer
in God's good time.

899
01:42:15,731 --> 01:42:19,167
And when that time comes,
I hope I'm still here.

900
01:42:19,371 --> 01:42:23,283
- You're not leaving, are you?
- It's a possibility.

901
01:42:23,490 --> 01:42:27,199
My bishop is coming tomorrow
on his annual visit...

902
01:42:27,410 --> 01:42:29,722
...and I've got such
a small congregation...

903
01:42:29,723 --> 01:42:32,723
...just two o three people
at the service.

904
01:42:32,929 --> 01:42:34,448
He may transfer me.

905
01:42:35,049 --> 01:42:38,049
The place wouldn't be the same
without you.

906
01:42:38,968 --> 01:42:44,599
Elizabeth and I just love this place.
We were born here too, you know.

907
01:42:45,287 --> 01:42:49,040
The bishop's a good egg,
maybe it'll be all right.

908
01:42:49,246 --> 01:42:53,922
Oh, by the way.
Don't underestimate Danaher.

909
01:42:54,126 --> 01:42:58,437
He may be clumsy, but he's got
a tremendous right and a jaw of granite.

910
01:43:01,245 --> 01:43:04,793
I did a little bit of boxing
in my time.

911
01:43:14,363 --> 01:43:16,751
You won't be laughin' now, will you?

912
01:43:19,482 --> 01:43:21,677
It was at Trinity.

913
01:43:21,882 --> 01:43:25,112
"Lightweight champion, 19"...

914
01:43:25,321 --> 01:43:29,279
The year doesn't matter.
It was long, long ago.

915
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:34,839
All right.

916
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:38,192
By the way,
would you join me in a glass of...

917
01:43:39,279 --> 01:43:41,349
Oh, no.

918
01:43:42,678 --> 01:43:46,637
No. You'll be in training now,
of course.

919
01:44:56,708 --> 01:45:00,859
- (MARY KATE) Did you have any supper?
- No.

920
01:45:01,067 --> 01:45:03,183
(SEAN) I'm not hungry.

921
01:45:03,387 --> 01:45:08,414
- The drink sometimes does that to a man.
- I haven't had anything to drink.

922
01:45:08,626 --> 01:45:13,653
(SEAN) If you wanna know,
I was talking to the vicar.

923
01:45:14,785 --> 01:45:19,062
- Mr Playfair.
- That's strange.

924
01:45:26,143 --> 01:45:28,452
I had a long talk
with Father Lonergan.

925
01:46:31,174 --> 01:46:34,563
Woman of the house! Where's me tea?

926
01:46:38,373 --> 01:46:39,852
Mary Kate?

927
01:46:40,053 --> 01:46:46,287
(MICHALEEN) Save your breath, boy.
She's gone from you, and small wonder.

928
01:46:46,492 --> 01:46:49,043
What are you talking about?
Where is she?

929
01:46:49,044 --> 01:46:52,044
She came tappin' at me door.

930
01:46:52,251 --> 01:46:54,426
"Will you join me to the train",
says she.

931
01:46:54,627 --> 01:46:55,527
Why?

932
01:46:55,730 --> 01:47:01,008
The very question. "Why", says I.
"Because I love him", says she.

933
01:47:01,209 --> 01:47:04,758
"I love him too much to go on livin'
with a man I'm ashamed of".

934
01:47:06,449 --> 01:47:11,158
- What time was this?
- Time for the Dublin train.

935
01:47:24,126 --> 01:47:26,435
Saddle up my horse, will you, please.

936
01:47:27,566 --> 01:47:29,556
Saddle his horse?

937
01:47:31,965 --> 01:47:35,559
I'll have no part in helpin' you
to put more shame on her.

938
01:47:37,244 --> 01:47:39,474
Saddle his horse...

939
01:47:42,603 --> 01:47:46,039
Dam da dam da, diddle de da...

940
01:48:14,959 --> 01:48:16,516
Well, we're off!

941
01:48:16,718 --> 01:48:21,428
Then, might I suggest that the train
already is four and a half hours late.

942
01:48:21,638 --> 01:48:24,390
Now, is it my fault?

943
01:48:24,637 --> 01:48:28,835
There's a match at Ballygar,
and the champions of all Ireland...

944
01:48:29,037 --> 01:48:33,632
If you knew your country's history
as well as you claim to know it...

945
01:48:33,836 --> 01:48:36,632
...you'd know
that they haven't been beaten...

946
01:48:36,633 --> 01:48:39,433
...west of the Shannon
for the last 22 years.

947
01:48:39,635 --> 01:48:42,832
- True!
- It's a lie!

948
01:49:50,745 --> 01:49:53,383
If this means what I hope it means...

949
01:49:53,584 --> 01:49:57,657
Danaher versus the Yank.
It'll be weeks on the green this time.

950
01:50:06,222 --> 01:50:07,735
Morning.

951
01:50:17,061 --> 01:50:18,574
Good day to you, sir.

952
01:50:32,219 --> 01:50:35,654
Five minutes, did you say? Right!

953
01:50:37,018 --> 01:50:40,852
He's walkin' her back,
the whole long way!

954
01:50:40,853 --> 01:50:43,253
It's Homeric,
that's what it is, Homeric.

955
01:50:43,457 --> 01:50:47,085
- Post a lookout. They may go home first.
- Where's your pistol?.

956
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:50,254
- In the same place.
- Excuse me, general.

957
01:50:51,536 --> 01:50:56,529
One by land, two by sea,
and I'll follow the lot.

958
01:50:56,735 --> 01:50:58,327
What a day for Inisfree!

959
01:50:58,535 --> 01:51:00,947
On a day like this
I can say only one thing.

960
01:51:00,948 --> 01:51:03,848
Gentlemen,
the drinks are on the house!

961
01:51:06,933 --> 01:51:08,889
Well, they are.

962
01:51:39,849 --> 01:51:43,966
(WOMAN) Darling, here is your shoe!

963
01:51:48,127 --> 01:51:50,004
Why, you...

964
01:51:54,446 --> 01:51:58,519
It's only five miles.
Just a good stretch of the legs.

965
01:52:03,605 --> 01:52:07,234
- You lost your shoe.
- Thank you very kindly, sir.

966
01:52:32,401 --> 01:52:39,033
(WOMAN) Mr... Mr Sean! Here's a good
stick to beat the lovely lady.

967
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:42,515
Thanks!

968
01:52:44,759 --> 01:52:46,636
(GUNSHOTS FROM OUTSIDE)

969
01:53:43,311 --> 01:53:48,020
I think your in-laws are comin'
to visit you, Squire Danaher.

970
01:54:25,024 --> 01:54:30,382
Danaher, you owe me 350 pounds.
Let's have it.

971
01:54:39,502 --> 01:54:41,857
So, the IRA is in this, too, eh?

972
01:54:42,062 --> 01:54:47,533
If it were, Will Danaher, not a stone
of your fine house'd be standin'.

973
01:54:47,741 --> 01:54:50,460
A beautiful sentiment.

974
01:54:54,580 --> 01:54:56,775
I'll pay you... never.

975
01:54:56,980 --> 01:55:00,210
That breaks all bargains.

976
01:55:01,539 --> 01:55:05,770
(SEAN) You can take your sister back.
It's your custom, not mine.

977
01:55:05,978 --> 01:55:09,527
(SEAN) No fortune, no marriage.
We call it quits.

978
01:55:14,857 --> 01:55:18,452
You'd do this to me, your own wife?

979
01:55:18,657 --> 01:55:21,534
- After what...
- (SEAN) It's done.

980
01:55:30,295 --> 01:55:33,445
There's your dirty money. Take it.

981
01:55:33,654 --> 01:55:36,964
Count it, you spawn, and look.

982
01:55:37,174 --> 01:55:41,325
If ever I see that face of yours again,
I'll push that through it.

983
01:55:58,811 --> 01:56:00,926
Charge it!

984
01:56:04,570 --> 01:56:08,642
I'll be goin' on home now.
I'll have the supper ready for you.

985
01:56:47,763 --> 01:56:49,958
All right, Will, you asked for it.

986
01:57:02,641 --> 01:57:06,190
Three to one given on Danaher.
Three to one...

987
01:57:06,401 --> 01:57:11,349
- I'll have some of that. 10 on Thornton.
- Done! Anyone else?

988
01:58:05,512 --> 01:58:09,709
(MICHALEEN) Gentlemen, if you please.
This is a private fight.

989
01:58:09,911 --> 01:58:14,189
The Marquis of Queensbury rules
will be observed on all occasions.

990
01:58:14,391 --> 01:58:17,029
Mind your nose, squire.

991
01:58:17,710 --> 01:58:20,463
Okay with me, Michaleen!

992
01:58:24,429 --> 01:58:25,703
Thanks.

993
01:58:25,909 --> 01:58:29,948
Non-belligerents will kindly remain
neutral.

994
01:58:30,148 --> 01:58:33,982
Now, shake hands and come out fighting.
I thank you.

995
01:58:34,188 --> 01:58:37,657
Did you hear that, everybody?
The Marquis of Queensbury rules.

996
01:58:37,867 --> 01:58:40,062
- The Marquis of Queensbury rules.
- Mar...

997
01:58:45,466 --> 01:58:48,503
Come on, get up,
Marquis of Queensbury.

998
01:58:48,706 --> 01:58:51,000
I hope
that Thornton beats him senseless.

999
01:58:51,001 --> 01:58:53,143
Mr Thornton is a married man, Sarah.

1000
01:58:53,345 --> 01:58:57,224
Who cares about him?
It's that big bully concerns me.

1001
01:58:57,425 --> 01:59:00,541
"I'm the best man in Inisfree".
As if I didn't know that.

1002
01:59:05,303 --> 01:59:09,296
Call them and tell them to send
reinforcements. There's a riot here.

1003
01:59:25,260 --> 01:59:27,455
Five to one on the big chap, Snuffy.

1004
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:31,096
- Given or taken?
- Given.

1005
01:59:44,618 --> 01:59:47,336
- You've had enough?
- No.

1006
01:59:52,376 --> 01:59:55,174
Well, give a man a hand, then.

1007
02:00:02,695 --> 02:00:05,004
Yes, inspector. Thank you, sir.

1008
02:00:05,215 --> 02:00:08,331
- What did he say?
- To put five pounds on Danaher's nose.

1009
02:00:09,334 --> 02:00:13,087
- Another ten on Thornton!
- Another.

1010
02:00:14,533 --> 02:00:19,686
- A pound on Danaher.
- Two pounds on Danaher, please.

1011
02:00:19,892 --> 02:00:22,486
Two pounds?

1012
02:00:22,692 --> 02:00:26,445
..."hands of a hundred battles,
eye on a thousand besides...

1013
02:00:26,651 --> 02:00:29,927
...stood alone on the victorious field,
his buckler bent...

1014
02:00:30,131 --> 02:00:33,122
...his broken sword clutched
in his mighty hand...

1015
02:00:33,330 --> 02:00:39,326
...the blood of a thousand wounds
oozing from his open veins"...

1016
02:00:39,530 --> 02:00:41,884
(NOISE OUTSIDE)

1017
02:01:06,126 --> 02:01:09,800
- Father! Father Lonergan!
- Shh, shhh.

1018
02:01:10,005 --> 02:01:13,520
- A big fight in the town!
- And in this fish right here.

1019
02:01:13,725 --> 02:01:17,319
- I'd put a stop to it but...
- You do that. It's your duty.

1020
02:01:17,524 --> 02:01:20,641
But you see,
it was Danaher and Sean Thornton!

1021
02:01:20,843 --> 02:01:23,596
- Who?
- Danaher and Sean Thornton.

1022
02:01:23,803 --> 02:01:26,317
Why the devil didn't you tell me?

1023
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:47,150
- Shouldn't we put a stop to it?
- We should, lad, we should.

1024
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:50,590
It's our duty, yes, it's our duty.

1025
02:01:58,158 --> 02:02:00,877
Come on, come on!

1026
02:02:07,837 --> 02:02:11,715
- How's that bettin' going?
- Even money, but don't ruin it.

1027
02:02:13,636 --> 02:02:17,787
Well, Danaher, you're a good fight,
I'll say that for you.

1028
02:02:17,995 --> 02:02:22,272
When it comes to that,
it's been a pleasure beatin' you.

1029
02:02:29,793 --> 02:02:31,351
Thanks.

1030
02:02:32,873 --> 02:02:36,785
- Will you take another 20 on Thornton?
- No, the book's closed.

1031
02:02:38,552 --> 02:02:42,942
- A pound on Thornton against the squire.
- Go away!

1032
02:02:45,191 --> 02:02:48,422
- How about a drink?
- The drink will be on the house.

1033
02:02:48,631 --> 02:02:50,124
That's a good idea.

1034
02:02:50,125 --> 02:02:53,625
The people of Ballyglon are comin' over
by bus, thousands of them.

1035
02:02:53,830 --> 02:02:57,663
That's a good idea, not that I'm tired.
I'm as fresh as a daisy.

1036
02:02:57,869 --> 02:03:01,145
You look more like a black-eyed Susan
to me. Let's go.

1037
02:03:01,589 --> 02:03:05,467
- Is that a public house?
- Yes, your lordship.

1038
02:03:05,668 --> 02:03:07,659
- Are they going in?
- Yes, your lordship.

1039
02:03:07,868 --> 02:03:13,021
- Does that mean that the fight's over?
- No, that's just the end of round one.

1040
02:03:15,747 --> 02:03:17,702
Come, keep away, keep away!

1041
02:03:25,105 --> 02:03:28,974
Whiskey? No, that'll be too warm,
it'll get your blood up.

1042
02:03:29,175 --> 02:03:30,975
Porter is the very thing.

1043
02:03:31,184 --> 02:03:35,541
Ah, it's peaceful and quiet in here,
isn't it?

1044
02:03:35,744 --> 02:03:37,415
You know...

1045
02:03:40,183 --> 02:03:42,651
This has been a fight
I'd come a long way to see.

1046
02:03:42,863 --> 02:03:45,456
I hope you can stick around
for the finish.

1047
02:03:46,862 --> 02:03:49,501
Don't worry about that!

1048
02:03:52,741 --> 02:03:56,017
You know, Yank.
I've taken quite a likin' to you.

1049
02:03:56,018 --> 02:03:58,418
I'm gettin' real fond of you, too.

1050
02:03:59,380 --> 02:04:03,578
Your widow, me sister...
She could've done a lot worse.

1051
02:04:03,780 --> 02:04:05,770
- True, true.
- Poor woman.

1052
02:04:05,979 --> 02:04:09,654
- Thanks, fill them up again.
- You buy me no drinks.

1053
02:04:09,859 --> 02:04:14,329
- The drinks are on the house, sir.
- I'm takin' no drinks from you, squint.

1054
02:04:14,538 --> 02:04:18,576
- I'm buyin' the drinks.
- You can buy me a drink at your wake.

1055
02:04:18,777 --> 02:04:20,733
And not before.

1056
02:04:22,857 --> 02:04:24,575
I'm buyin'!

1057
02:04:28,936 --> 02:04:31,404
Bar towel!

1058
02:04:35,175 --> 02:04:37,928
- What time is it?
- Half past five, sir.

1059
02:04:44,574 --> 02:04:45,847
Lord, he beat you!

1060
02:04:56,012 --> 02:05:02,280
Why... I hope you won't be vexed with me,
but I've lost three pounds to Mrs Delany.

1061
02:05:02,491 --> 02:05:05,085
I know I shouldn't have bet but...

1062
02:05:05,291 --> 02:05:08,088
There you are, Stuffy, 15 pounds.

1063
02:05:10,730 --> 02:05:14,517
- Hello there, Elizabeth.
- Your lordship.

1064
02:05:14,729 --> 02:05:19,723
- And what have you been doing all day?
- If you'll excuse me, I'll...

1065
02:05:19,928 --> 02:05:22,761
...I'll get your tea, Snuffy.

1066
02:05:25,128 --> 02:05:29,200
<i>There was a wild colonial boy</i>

1067
02:05:29,407 --> 02:05:32,604
<i>Jack Duggan was his name</i>

1068
02:05:32,807 --> 02:05:36,924
<i>He was born and bred in Ireland</i>

1069
02:05:37,126 --> 02:05:40,913
<i>In a place called Castlemaine</i>

1070
02:05:41,125 --> 02:05:45,038
<i>He was his father's only son</i>

1071
02:05:45,245 --> 02:05:48,759
<i>His mother's pride and joy</i>

1072
02:05:48,964 --> 02:05:52,957
<i>And dearly did his parents love</i>

1073
02:05:53,164 --> 02:05:57,520
<i>This wild colonial boy</i>

1074
02:06:08,961 --> 02:06:13,079
Woman of the house!
I brought the brother home to supper.

1075
02:06:14,361 --> 02:06:17,079
He's kindly welcome.

1076
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:20,276
God bless all in this house.

1077
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:22,356
- Wipe your feet.
- Thank you, ma'am.

1078
02:06:22,559 --> 02:06:26,154
Sit down, sit down.
That's what chairs are for.

1079
02:06:31,358 --> 02:06:33,667
Hurry it up!

1080
02:06:40,797 --> 02:06:46,314
Well, then. So peace and quiet
came once again to Inisfree...

1081
02:06:46,516 --> 02:06:49,871
...and we were... Good heavens,
what's that woman up to now?

1082
02:06:50,075 --> 02:06:53,465
Make way,
she'll be runnin' you down with that!

1083
02:07:03,593 --> 02:07:07,108
When the Reverend Mr Playfair
comes down...

1084
02:07:07,313 --> 02:07:10,941
...I want us all to cheer like
Protestants. Now, spread out!

1085
02:07:24,630 --> 02:07:26,541
(CROWD CHEERS)

1086
02:07:26,750 --> 02:07:30,947
Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray!

1087
02:07:45,507 --> 02:07:51,536
No patty fingers, if you please.
The proprieties at all times.

1088
02:07:53,386 --> 02:07:55,820
Hold on to your hats. Come on.
