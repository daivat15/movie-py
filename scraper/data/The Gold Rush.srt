00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,130
In the great Gold Rush, Alaska
was the hope and dream of men,

4
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,413
the ruthless siren
of the Far North,

5
00:01:13,693 --> 00:01:15,490
beckoning thousands
to her icy bosom.

6
00:01:15,779 --> 00:01:17,849
Beckoning thousands
to her unknown regions.

7
00:01:18,157 --> 00:01:21,035
Chilkoot Pass was the great barrier
to the gold fields.

8
00:01:21,368 --> 00:01:23,802
Over this Pass men faced
untold misery and hardship.

9
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:26,715
Many lost their lives.
Some fell by the wayside,

10
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:28,679
others lost courage
and turned back.

11
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,439
But the brave went on.

12
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:37,344
Far into the icy north,
deep into the silent nowhere,

13
00:01:37,678 --> 00:01:40,272
came an undaunted lone prospector.

14
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:32,111
And somewhere in that nowhere
was another lone prospector.

15
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:41,750
With cheerful optimism
our little Columbus descended,

16
00:02:42,122 --> 00:02:44,955
then stopped, stepped,
slipped and slid.

17
00:03:00,725 --> 00:03:03,080
"Now let me see,"
thought the little fellow.

18
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:05,306
"Before I know where I am,
I must get there."

19
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:50,293
There in that frozen wilderness
a dream came true,

20
00:03:50,654 --> 00:03:53,009
and a lone voice shrieked
into the solemn sky,

21
00:03:53,323 --> 00:03:57,316
"Eureka! I've found it,
a mountain of gold!"

22
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:06,853
But the elements laughed,
roared and thundered.

23
00:04:11,092 --> 00:04:12,889
In that raging nowhere
was a lone cabin,

24
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,676
and another lone man,
Black Larson,

25
00:04:15,973 --> 00:04:18,168
an unmitigated,
predatory scoundrel.

26
00:04:56,349 --> 00:04:59,785
Out of the lashing storm
came the Little Fellow

27
00:05:00,145 --> 00:05:03,421
to find shelter and perhaps
a little hospitality.

28
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:16,920
There he sat,
resting his weary bones

29
00:05:17,205 --> 00:05:20,038
as the icy wind howled
through the knothole.

30
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,639
"Come here," said Larson.

31
00:05:55,329 --> 00:05:56,682
"What are you doing?"

32
00:05:57,206 --> 00:05:58,685
"Eating, obviously."

33
00:05:58,958 --> 00:05:59,993
"Get out."

34
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,198
"Go on!"

35
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,664
"Get out!"

36
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,283
The wind also was giving
Big Jim his troubles.

37
00:07:13,622 --> 00:07:15,931
Big Jim was the noble type.
He had suffered.

38
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,845
Oh, how he loved to suffer.
He suffered about everything.

39
00:07:44,321 --> 00:07:46,039
"Get out," said Black Larson.

40
00:07:46,324 --> 00:07:48,758
"Or I'll fill you both
full of lead."

41
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,412
"Now then,
the pair of you, get out!"

42
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,995
"Out!"

43
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:04,794
That kind of noise
Jim don't tolerate.

44
00:08:56,316 --> 00:08:58,511
"I'll stay right here, understand?"

45
00:08:59,027 --> 00:09:01,257
"Right here," said Big Jim.

46
00:09:01,947 --> 00:09:05,303
"Yes, sir, he'll stay right here,"
said the Little Fellow.

47
00:09:13,584 --> 00:09:16,178
"Understand? We stay right here."

48
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:23,082
And stay they did,

49
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:25,859
for days and nights.
The cabin moaned and groaned.

50
00:09:26,181 --> 00:09:29,571
Two men walked and never talked,
hunger gnawed their bones.

51
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,408
"I must have food!" yelled Big Jim.

52
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,991
"I must have food!"

53
00:10:22,283 --> 00:10:23,921
"What are you eating?"
said Black Larson.

54
00:10:25,661 --> 00:10:26,650
"Nothing."

55
00:10:26,913 --> 00:10:28,028
"Open your mouth!"

56
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:41,303
"Liar! It's that candle."

57
00:10:42,388 --> 00:10:45,266
"That?" said the Little Fellow.
"How revolting."

58
00:10:49,103 --> 00:10:52,539
"If I thought you were holding out
on me, I'd slit your gizzard!"

59
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:26,219
"One of us must brave that storm,
if we're to get food."

60
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,314
"Come here, the pair of you."

61
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,697
"We'll cut the cards
and the low man goes."

62
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,623
"You're the man," said Jim.

63
00:12:00,931 --> 00:12:02,364
"Goodbye, good luck."

64
00:12:02,641 --> 00:12:04,916
"Don't forget
to bring home the bacon."

65
00:12:30,087 --> 00:12:34,285
Somewhere in that nowhere,
the law was looking for Black Larson.

66
00:13:36,658 --> 00:13:40,173
Desperate with hunger
and here it was Thanksgiving Day.

67
00:13:40,538 --> 00:13:43,211
Nevertheless there was something
to be thankful for.

68
00:13:53,677 --> 00:13:56,066
"Not quite done yet,
give it two more minutes."

69
00:13:56,388 --> 00:13:57,946
"Come on, come on," said Big Jim.

70
00:16:38,145 --> 00:16:40,022
After scouring the country for food,

71
00:16:40,314 --> 00:16:42,589
the Little Fellow had to admit
he had seen nothing,

72
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,731
not even a field mouse.

73
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:55,838
From the pangs of hunger,

74
00:16:56,123 --> 00:16:58,398
Big Jim was becoming delirious,
hysterical.

75
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:00,665
In fact he was a pain in the neck.

76
00:17:01,003 --> 00:17:03,437
"Food, food!" he thundered.

77
00:17:05,716 --> 00:17:07,354
"I can put another shoe in the pot."

78
00:17:07,635 --> 00:17:09,910
"No, no, anything but that!"

79
00:17:12,974 --> 00:17:15,329
Poor Jim, he couldn't take it.

80
00:18:07,074 --> 00:18:08,712
"What's the matter?"
said the Little Fellow.

81
00:18:08,993 --> 00:18:10,949
"I thought you were a chicken."

82
00:18:20,255 --> 00:18:22,610
"Well, build up the fire,"
said Big Jim.

83
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:48,375
"What's the matter with you?"
said the Little Fellow.

84
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:50,985
"Come, my pretty bird,"
said Big Jim.

85
00:18:51,288 --> 00:18:52,687
"Don't be childish."

86
00:19:04,886 --> 00:19:07,036
"Hey, quit it.
Don't be foolish, it's me!"

87
00:19:09,641 --> 00:19:11,472
"You!" said Jim.

88
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:14,445
"I'm sorry. I must be crazy."

89
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,198
"You're telling me,"
said the Little Fellow.

90
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:24,179
"You go inside. I'll take the gun
in case you lose it."

91
00:19:54,022 --> 00:19:55,011
Chicken or no chicken,

92
00:19:55,273 --> 00:19:57,867
the Little Fellow looks appetizing
to Big Jim.

93
00:22:44,247 --> 00:22:48,035
Meanwhile Black Larson stumbled
onto Big Jim's mountain of gold.

94
00:23:01,766 --> 00:23:03,677
Then came the parting of the ways,

95
00:23:03,976 --> 00:23:07,048
Big Jim to his mine,
our hero to his fate.

96
00:23:07,397 --> 00:23:08,671
"Goodbye," said the Little Fellow.

97
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,056
"It's been a great pleasure
knowing you."

98
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:30,361
Treachery awaited Big Jim
at his mountain of gold.

99
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,698
Big Jim looked deep into the eyes

100
00:23:47,982 --> 00:23:49,700
of Black Larson

101
00:23:49,984 --> 00:23:51,940
and saw there the soul of a skunk.

102
00:24:14,218 --> 00:24:16,129
Caught in a maelstrom
of desperate deeds,

103
00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:19,148
Black Larson swept on
to impending doom.

104
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:44,937
And out of a dream
in that frozen waste, a city grew.

105
00:24:45,293 --> 00:24:48,330
And humanity warmed it with living,
loving and desiring.

106
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,369
Georgia.

107
00:25:09,695 --> 00:25:11,413
Jack was a ladies' man.

108
00:25:12,948 --> 00:25:14,176
Georgia was quick and impulsive,

109
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,042
proud and independent.

110
00:25:32,344 --> 00:25:34,300
In the evening Georgia worked
as a dancehall girl.

111
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,531
Jack had lots of appeal for Georgia.

112
00:25:58,831 --> 00:26:00,867
Perhaps that's why she resented him.

113
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:31,460
Out of the night
came the Little Fellow,

114
00:26:31,741 --> 00:26:34,460
towards the dancehall,
that beacon light of pleasure,

115
00:26:34,828 --> 00:26:36,819
that retreat of lost dreams.

116
00:28:27,282 --> 00:28:29,193
"Georgia,
why aren't you nice to Jack?"

117
00:28:29,701 --> 00:28:31,976
"I believe he really likes you,"
said the girl.

118
00:28:32,913 --> 00:28:34,983
"He likes everybody,"
said Georgia quite audibly.

119
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:37,565
"I'm bored with this place,"
she continued.

120
00:28:37,877 --> 00:28:41,392
"I'd give it all up if I could find
someone honest and worthwhile."

121
00:28:45,426 --> 00:28:47,940
"Don't worry,
I'll find him someday."

122
00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:51,072
Then she turned

123
00:28:51,349 --> 00:28:53,988
and looked and looked

124
00:28:54,436 --> 00:28:55,994
and looked.

125
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:31,415
"Kinda fresh, ain't ya?"
thought Jack.

126
00:30:31,707 --> 00:30:32,901
"Get down off that high horse."

127
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:34,805
"Me and you are gonna dance."

128
00:30:36,004 --> 00:30:37,756
"Hey there, pan out a tune."

129
00:30:42,469 --> 00:30:44,744
"Just a moment,
I said we're gonna dance."

130
00:30:45,055 --> 00:30:46,773
"I beg your pardon," said Georgia.

131
00:30:47,057 --> 00:30:48,490
To show her utter contempt for Jack,

132
00:30:48,767 --> 00:30:52,077
she picked out the most deplorable
looking tramp in the dancehall.

133
00:30:52,813 --> 00:30:54,246
"Hey you, come here."

134
00:30:57,443 --> 00:30:59,798
"Yes, you. Do you want to dance?"

135
00:31:03,992 --> 00:31:07,268
"You see, I'm very particular
about whom I dance with."

136
00:33:47,918 --> 00:33:51,149
And there he stood,
the dauntless cavalier, guarding...

137
00:33:51,505 --> 00:33:52,779
her sanctuary.

138
00:34:32,883 --> 00:34:34,919
"If you wanna make a hit
with your lady friend,"

139
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:38,131
"you should put your hat
on straight, like this!"

140
00:34:39,765 --> 00:34:41,562
"Take that you... Ouch!"

141
00:34:52,779 --> 00:34:54,007
"Huh! Very good."

142
00:34:54,281 --> 00:34:56,556
"Didn't know me own strength,"
said the Little Fellow.

143
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:26,259
Hank Curtis' cabin was
a stone's throw from the dancehall.

144
00:35:26,607 --> 00:35:28,996
Hank was a mining engineer
who lived alone

145
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,588
and occasionally went
on long expeditions

146
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:31,817
into the Far North.

147
00:35:32,072 --> 00:35:33,551
Hank was kind and human,

148
00:35:33,823 --> 00:35:35,461
and our hero cold and hungry,

149
00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:38,302
and the beans smelled good
and the coffee was steaming hot.

150
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,930
So the Little Fellow
devised a way of getting breakfast.

151
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:31,662
Big Jim recovered from the blow
he received from Black Larson

152
00:37:31,992 --> 00:37:33,425
but lost his memory.

153
00:37:52,389 --> 00:37:54,345
Hank's partner arrives.

154
00:37:54,641 --> 00:37:56,836
Both are ready to leave
on a long expedition.

155
00:37:57,144 --> 00:37:59,260
Hank informs his partner
that the Little Fellow

156
00:37:59,563 --> 00:38:01,713
is to look after the cabin
while he's away.

157
00:38:06,029 --> 00:38:08,907
"Goodbye," said Hank.
"And don't forget to feed the mule."

158
00:38:38,272 --> 00:38:41,742
Since that night in the dancehall
the Little Fellow hadn't seen Georgia,

159
00:38:42,109 --> 00:38:44,669
but an incident
was to bring them together again.

160
00:39:38,628 --> 00:39:41,222
There she stood,
her loveliness lighting the room,

161
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:43,140
filling his soul
with the music of romance

162
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:44,983
for which he was so ill-fitted.

163
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,377
As she introduced her friends,
his heart began to sing.

164
00:40:03,071 --> 00:40:06,825
As they warmed up by the stove,
he excused himself to get firewood.

165
00:40:44,824 --> 00:40:47,133
And in that cabin
his secret was revealed,

166
00:40:47,452 --> 00:40:48,885
his love for Georgia.

167
00:40:49,162 --> 00:40:51,073
And the girls giggled and laughed,

168
00:40:51,373 --> 00:40:53,125
perhaps in order to hide their pity.

169
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:55,726
For in the world of the dancehall
it wasn't wise for the girls

170
00:40:56,045 --> 00:40:57,398
to reveal their hearts.

171
00:40:57,671 --> 00:41:00,743
And so they thought
they'd have a little fun with him.

172
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:08,721
There in the gloaming they sat,

173
00:41:09,017 --> 00:41:11,247
their faces alight with mischief,

174
00:41:11,728 --> 00:41:14,242
but all the while
his heart was singing.

175
00:41:38,632 --> 00:41:41,192
And so she fooled and flirted
and stroked his hair.

176
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,740
He knew she was fooling,
but he was happy.

177
00:41:44,055 --> 00:41:46,444
For she was near him,
holding his hand,

178
00:41:46,766 --> 00:41:48,165
smiling at him.

179
00:41:58,487 --> 00:42:00,000
"Nice place you have here,"
said Georgia.

180
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,316
"I hope you will invite us again."

181
00:42:02,616 --> 00:42:03,651
What if she were fooling?

182
00:42:03,909 --> 00:42:06,104
He was enjoying
the warmth of her attention.

183
00:42:06,412 --> 00:42:08,801
And the lady was enjoying
the warmth of his chair.

184
00:42:33,191 --> 00:42:34,306
And now she was leaving.

185
00:42:34,567 --> 00:42:36,444
The light of her loveliness
would be gone.

186
00:42:36,736 --> 00:42:38,488
And he would be left
with an emptiness,

187
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,135
to return to his bleak,
lonely existence.

188
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:42,565
"Pardon me,"
said the Little Fellow,

189
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:45,659
"But, uh..."
He was lost for words.

190
00:42:48,123 --> 00:42:49,761
"Would you really like
to come again?"

191
00:42:50,042 --> 00:42:52,636
"Of course," said Georgia.
"What do you say, girls?"

192
00:42:53,045 --> 00:42:55,320
"We'll come for dinner
New Year's Eve," said the ladies.

193
00:42:55,631 --> 00:42:56,620
"Very well," said Georgia.

194
00:42:56,883 --> 00:42:59,033
"We'll come to dinner
New Year's Eve."

195
00:43:59,617 --> 00:44:02,689
Of course at that moment
Georgia would forget her gloves!

196
00:44:23,017 --> 00:44:25,485
For the next few days the Little
Fellow hustled and shoveled

197
00:44:25,812 --> 00:44:27,962
in order to buy
that New Year's dinner.

198
00:45:54,824 --> 00:45:58,612
The eve of a new year.
New hopes and new dreams.

199
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:19,241
And there was Georgia, caressing him
with her smiles and tender glances.

200
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,835
And the girls called for a speech.

201
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,631
But he was too happy to speak.

202
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,813
All that mattered
was Georgia was there. Georgia!

203
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,463
So he muttered and stuttered
and finally said,

204
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:31,852
"I can't make a speech
but I'll do a dance."

205
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,469
And a dance he did, with the rolls.

206
00:50:47,639 --> 00:50:52,394
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

207
00:50:52,811 --> 00:50:57,327
<i>And never brought to mind</i>

208
00:50:58,942 --> 00:51:04,221
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

209
00:51:04,657 --> 00:51:10,209
<i>And days of auld lang syne</i>

210
00:51:10,914 --> 00:51:16,864
<i>For auld lang syne
My dear</i>

211
00:51:17,337 --> 00:51:20,090
<i>For auld lang...</i>

212
00:52:10,311 --> 00:52:12,427
In the midst of all their revelry
the vague memory

213
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:14,880
of a promise crept
into Georgia's mind.

214
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:18,425
"Let's go up and visit
the Little Fellow," she said.

215
00:52:58,029 --> 00:52:59,382
"We'll have some fun
with him," said Jack.

216
00:52:59,655 --> 00:53:02,169
"We'll send Georgia in first,
then give him a scare."

217
00:53:58,761 --> 00:53:59,750
"Oh, forget it," said Jack.

218
00:54:00,012 --> 00:54:02,242
"How about giving me
a little attention?"

219
00:54:24,497 --> 00:54:26,135
A day or so later
in the Recorder's office,

220
00:54:26,415 --> 00:54:28,326
Big Jim tried to convince
the assayers

221
00:54:28,626 --> 00:54:30,423
that he had a mountain of gold.

222
00:54:34,799 --> 00:54:36,471
"Where is this place?" they said.

223
00:54:36,843 --> 00:54:39,152
But Big Jim's memory
had failed him.

224
00:54:39,471 --> 00:54:41,939
All he knew was
that it was near the cabin.

225
00:54:49,982 --> 00:54:51,210
"The cabin, that's it!"

226
00:54:51,484 --> 00:54:55,113
"f I could find my way to the cabin
I could find the mine."

227
00:54:55,822 --> 00:54:57,414
"But I can't remember."

228
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,234
"Hey!" said Jack,
"Georgia's been looking for you."

229
00:55:16,553 --> 00:55:17,588
The Little Fellow knew otherwise.

230
00:55:17,846 --> 00:55:20,519
How dare that cad mention
her name so lightly?

231
00:55:20,849 --> 00:55:22,680
For two pins
he'd give him another thrashing.

232
00:55:22,976 --> 00:55:26,651
However being a little underweight
he would ignore the insult.

233
00:55:40,328 --> 00:55:42,717
But it was true.
Georgia had been looking for him.

234
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:44,154
Georgia had written him a letter.

235
00:56:05,313 --> 00:56:09,272
And as he went looking for Georgia,
so Big Jim went looking for him.

236
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:20,083
"You, you!" said Big Jim.

237
00:56:23,416 --> 00:56:27,329
"You! The very man
I've been looking for!"

238
00:56:27,712 --> 00:56:29,782
"The cabin, the cabin! Where is it?"

239
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:31,409
"Answer me, I say!"

240
00:56:31,675 --> 00:56:34,189
"Can't you speak, man? Tell me!"

241
00:56:34,845 --> 00:56:37,234
"Where's the cabin? Where is it?"

242
00:56:38,015 --> 00:56:40,165
"At last I shall find
my mountain of gold."

243
00:56:40,476 --> 00:56:42,034
"To your feet man, quick!"

244
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:43,630
"You're coming with me!"

245
00:56:43,896 --> 00:56:47,411
"Take me to the cabin
and I'll make you a millionaire!"

246
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:53,653
"Georgia! Just a moment,"
said the Little Fellow.

247
00:57:01,081 --> 00:57:03,515
"Georgia, you don't have to explain.
I understand."

248
00:57:03,834 --> 00:57:05,711
"I love you.
I'll take you away from this life."

249
00:57:06,003 --> 00:57:07,721
"I'm going away, and when I return,"

250
00:57:08,006 --> 00:57:09,359
"I shall come back."

251
00:57:21,395 --> 00:57:24,307
Exhausted and footweary,
they arrived at the cabin.

252
00:57:28,986 --> 00:57:30,863
"Ah!" said Big Jim,
"it won't be long now."

253
00:57:31,155 --> 00:57:34,591
"Bring in the eats and tomorrow
we'll start for the mine.

254
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:38,197
"Here, take a swig of this.
It'll put hair on your topcoat."

255
00:58:14,994 --> 00:58:18,066
"My, this is a heavy lamb chop,"
said the Little fellow.

256
00:59:21,399 --> 00:59:23,833
Then fate - it's always fate -
played its little joke,

257
00:59:24,152 --> 00:59:26,825
and again the elements laughed,
roared and thundered,

258
00:59:27,155 --> 00:59:29,953
but through it all
our heroes soundly slumbered.

259
00:59:50,597 --> 00:59:52,394
Then came the dawn.

260
00:59:59,481 --> 01:00:00,675
The Little Fellow awoke,

261
01:00:00,941 --> 01:00:02,932
blissfully ignorant
of what happened the night before,

262
01:00:03,236 --> 01:00:06,512
but feeling definitely conscious
of "the morning after".

263
01:00:23,507 --> 01:00:26,465
"Oh well, may as well tidy up
and get breakfast."

264
01:00:51,371 --> 01:00:54,408
"This is the worst liver attack
I've ever had."

265
01:01:07,888 --> 01:01:09,207
"Feel that rocking?"

266
01:01:09,682 --> 01:01:10,797
"It's the stomach."

267
01:02:02,614 --> 01:02:03,967
"It's not the stomach."

268
01:02:18,089 --> 01:02:19,886
"Let's go to the other side."

269
01:02:20,174 --> 01:02:21,527
"We'll see how far it
will go over."

270
01:02:46,202 --> 01:02:48,796
"Something
must be missing underneath."

271
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:53,244
"I'll go outside
and see what it is."

272
01:03:48,102 --> 01:03:49,933
"Now," said Big Jim,
"don't get excited."

273
01:03:50,229 --> 01:03:53,505
"Take it easy, don't move,
don't breathe!"

274
01:03:57,028 --> 01:04:00,020
"I said don't breathe, stupid."

275
01:04:04,161 --> 01:04:07,358
"You can be most annoying
at times."

276
01:04:10,334 --> 01:04:12,643
"If you'll only be cool, be calm,"
said Big Jim,

277
01:04:12,962 --> 01:04:14,600
"We have nothing to worry about."

278
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:31,664
"Now show a little character!
Where's your willpower?"

279
01:04:38,031 --> 01:04:40,670
"Now listen,
I've got a very good idea."

280
01:04:41,034 --> 01:04:42,911
"Hold your hands like this,
then I can get out first."

281
01:05:09,064 --> 01:05:10,622
"You see what I mean?"
said Big Jim.

282
01:05:10,899 --> 01:05:13,367
"Your mind is chaotic.
You have no psychology."

283
01:05:13,694 --> 01:05:15,366
"You have no control."

284
01:05:35,342 --> 01:05:37,731
And Big Jim discovered his claim!

285
01:06:15,636 --> 01:06:17,467
"Now we shall be rich," said Jim.

286
01:06:17,763 --> 01:06:19,594
"We shall be millionaires!"

287
01:06:20,432 --> 01:06:21,501
And so they were.

288
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,899
Now they were homeward bound

289
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:48,443
and they were leaving the hardship
and toil of Alaska

290
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:50,275
to live in the land
of milk and honey.

291
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:53,267
To live, laugh and indulge themselves
in the lap of luxury.

292
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:56,153
They were famous,
and sought after by the press.

293
01:07:03,479 --> 01:07:04,594
In their cabin deluxe

294
01:07:04,855 --> 01:07:06,925
they were welcomed
and waited upon.

295
01:07:26,211 --> 01:07:28,406
The reporter wanted to write
the Little Fellow's life story,

296
01:07:28,714 --> 01:07:31,023
"From Rags to Riches",
and he graciously consented.

297
01:07:44,856 --> 01:07:46,255
And Big Jim was manicured.

298
01:07:46,525 --> 01:07:48,914
"Not the nails," said he,
"the corns."

299
01:07:51,864 --> 01:07:53,377
The reporter thought of a good idea,

300
01:07:53,658 --> 01:07:55,774
to have the Little Fellow pose
in his mining clothes.

301
01:07:56,077 --> 01:07:57,874
It would make a human story.

302
01:08:07,339 --> 01:08:08,374
Georgia...

303
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:24,229
There she was in the steerage.
Neither knew of the other's presence.

304
01:08:24,608 --> 01:08:27,645
Georgia overheard the officer say
there was a stowaway aboard.

305
01:09:59,751 --> 01:10:01,070
"You!" said Georgia.

306
01:10:01,336 --> 01:10:03,486
"I thought I'd never see you again."

307
01:10:03,797 --> 01:10:05,515
And then she mistook him
for the stowaway.

308
01:10:22,067 --> 01:10:23,819
The officer was going
to put him in irons.

309
01:10:24,111 --> 01:10:27,023
But Georgia pleaded for him
and said she would pay his fare.

310
01:10:36,958 --> 01:10:38,710
"Heck!" said the Captain.
"That's no stowaway."

"That's Big Jim's partner,
the multimillionaire."

312
01:10:43,674 --> 01:10:45,904
Then of course there were apologies.

313
01:10:47,303 --> 01:10:49,134
The Little Fellow
gathered himself together.

314
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:52,228
James, the valet, was told
to prepare for an extra guest.

315
01:11:02,068 --> 01:11:04,866
"Pardon me," said the reporter,
"but who's the lady?"

316
01:11:05,656 --> 01:11:07,089
"Buzz buzz buzz!"

317
01:11:07,366 --> 01:11:09,596
"Oh, you don't say!
Well, congratulations."

318
01:11:09,952 --> 01:11:12,750
"This will make a great story,
and with a happy ending."

319
01:11:14,624 --> 01:11:15,693
And so it was.

320
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,399
A happy ending.

321
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,000
THE END

322
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,074
