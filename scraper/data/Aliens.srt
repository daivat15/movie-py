1
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:05,262
Bio readouts are all in the green.
Looks like she's alive.

2
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,768
Well, there goes
our salvage, guys.

3
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:40,339
How are we today?
Ohh. Terrible.

4
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:43,300
Well, better than
yesterday, at least.

5
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,137
Where am I?
You're safe.

6
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,639
You're at Gateway Station.
Been here a couple of days.

7
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:52,143
You were pretty groggy at first,
but now you're okay.

8
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,729
Oh, looks like
you've got a visitor.

9
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,941
Jonesy. Come here.

10
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,236
Hey, come here.

11
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,697
How are you, you stupid cat?

12
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:08,701
How are you?
Where have you been?

13
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:12,621
Guess you two have met, huh?
I'm Burke. Carter Burke.

14
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:17,251
I work for the company, but don't let that fool you.
I'm really an okay guy.

15
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,463
I'm glad to see you're
feeling a little better.

16
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:24,091
They tell me that all the weakness
and disorientation should pass soon.

17
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:30,097
That's just natural side effects of such an
unusually long hypersleep, or something like that.

18
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,349
What do you mean?

19
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,810
How long was I out there?

20
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,979
Inhalation Therapy, report to-

21
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,315
Has no one discussed
this with you yet?

22
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,400
No.
But, I mean...

23
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:45,488
I don't... recognize
this place.

24
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,573
No, I know. Uh-

25
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:51,368
Okay. It's just that, uh,
this might be a shock to you.

26
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:54,080
It's long-
How long?

27
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,165
Please.

28
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:01,128
57 years.
What?

29
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:05,466
That's the thing. You were
out there for 57 years.

30
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,677
What happened was you had drifted
right through the core systems.

31
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,597
And it's really
just blind luck...

32
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,892
that a deep-salvage team
found you when they did.

33
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,269
It's one in a thousand, really.

34
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:22,066
I think you're damn lucky to be alive, kiddo.
You could be floating out there forever.

35
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,361
You-You okay?

36
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,280
Uhh-

37
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,537
Uuh!

38
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,872
You okay?

39
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:46,215
Oh-h-h! Oh, God!

40
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:51,178
Nurse! Please!
God!

41
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,265
Someone get in here now!

42
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,392
Now!

43
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,686
- Hold!
- Please.

44
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,980
Hold on!

45
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,065
Kill me!

46
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,660
No!

47
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,746
Uh!

48
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,586
Bad dreams again? You want
something to help you sleep?

49
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,921
No.

50
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,007
I've slept enough.

51
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,177
Jonesy.

52
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,263
Come here.

53
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,432
Shh.

54
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,730
It's all right.

55
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:47,526
It's all right now.

56
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,653
It's over.

57
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:14,845
Dr Hirsch, 334. Dr. Hirsch, 334.

58
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,389
Hi. Sorry I'm late. I've been
running behind all morning.

59
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,267
Is there any word
about my daughter?

60
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:23,771
Uh... I really think we should
worry about the hearing now.

61
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:27,232
'Cause we don't have a lot of time, okay?
I read your deposition, and it's great.

62
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:30,361
If you just stick to that, I think we'll be fine.
The thing to remember is,

63
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,404
there're gonna be a lot
of heavyweights in there.

64
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,569
You've got feds and Interstellar
Commerce Commission,

65
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,660
Colonial Administration,
insurance company guys-

66
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,329
Do you have any news
about my daughter?

67
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:46,001
Well, we did come up with some information.
Why don't we sit down?

68
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,171
I was hoping to wait
until after the inquest.

69
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,256
Um-

70
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:57,262
"Amanda Ripley-McClaren" -
married name, I guess-

71
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,515
"Age 66."

72
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,934
And that was at
the time of her death,

73
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,313
which was two years ago.

74
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,650
I'm real sorry.

75
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,703
Amy.

76
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:28,544
She was cremated and interred at Westlake
Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.

77
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,006
No children. I checked.

78
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:41,348
I promised her... that I'd
be home for her birthday.

79
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,229
Her 11th birthday.

80
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,361
I'djust like to go, uh-

81
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,613
back to this point about
the override destruct order.

82
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,325
Is it in the file?
I don't understand this.

83
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,703
We have been here
for three and a half hours.

84
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,428
Now, how many different ways do you
want me to tell the same story?

85
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:11,128
Look at it from our
perspective, please.

86
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,213
Please?

87
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,093
Now, you freely admit to
detonating the engines of,

88
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,013
and thereby destroying,
an M-class starsreighter,

89
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,557
a rather expensive piece
of hardware.

90
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,852
Forty-two million
in adjusted dollars.

91
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,688
That's minus payload,
of course.

92
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:34,151
The lifeboat's flight recorder corroborates
some elements of your account,

93
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:39,281
in that, for reasons unknown, the
Nostromo set down on LV-426,

94
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:43,911
an unsurveyed planet at that time,
that it resumed its course...

95
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:48,916
and was subsequently set for self-destruct
by you for reasons unknown.

96
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,335
Not for reasons unknown.
I told you.

97
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:57,174
We set down there on company orders to get
this thing, which destroyed my crew...

98
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,718
and your expensive ship.

99
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:03,472
The analysis team, which went over the
lifeboat centimeter by centimeter,

100
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,683
found no physical evidence
of the creature you describe.

101
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:10,813
Good! That's because I blew it
out of the goddamn air lock,

102
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,566
like I said.

103
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:20,906
Are there any species like this
hostile organism on LV-426?

104
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,492
No. It's a rock.
No indigenous life.

105
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:29,081
Did I.Q.'s just drop sharply
while I was away?

106
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,542
Ma'am, I already said
it was not indigenous.

107
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,378
It was a derelict spacecraft.
It was an alien ship.

108
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:39,049
It was not from there. Do you get it?
We homed in on its beacon.

109
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:41,927
And found something
never recorded once...

110
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,514
in over 300 surveyed worlds.

111
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:50,394
- "A creature that gestates inside
a living human host." - Yes.

112
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:54,398
These are your words. "And has
concentrated acid for blood."

113
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,733
That's right.

114
00:12:56,818 --> 00:13:00,737
Look. I can see
where this is going,

115
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,240
but I'm telling you
that those things exist.

116
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:06,535
- Thank you, Officer Ripley. That will be all.
- Please. You're not listening to me.

117
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,121
Kane, the crew member-

118
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,916
Kane, who went into that ship, said
he saw thousands of eggs there.

119
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,085
Thousands. Thank you.
That will be all.

120
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,212
Goddamn it, that's not all!

121
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:21,008
Because if one of those things gets
down here, then that will be all!

122
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,635
Then all of this-this bullshit
that you think is so important-

123
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,514
You can just kiss
all of that good-bye!

124
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,606
It is the finding
of this court of inquiry that...

125
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,774
Warrant Officer E. Ripley,

126
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,903
NOC14472,

127
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,739
has acted with
questionable judgment...

128
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:48,243
and is unfit to hold an I.C.C. license
as a commercial flight officer.

129
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:53,415
Said license is hereby
suspended indefinitely.

130
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:59,588
Now, no criminal charges will be
filed against you at this time,

131
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,924
and you are released
on your own recognizance...

132
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,801
for a six-month period
ofpsychometric probation,

133
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:10,390
to include monthly review
by an I.C.C. psychiatric technician.

134
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,062
These proceedings are closed.

135
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,158
That could have been better.

136
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,703
Look, I think the-Ripley?
Van Leuwen.

137
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:35,040
Why don't you
just check out LV-426?

138
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,877
Because I don't have to. There have
been people there for over 20 years,

139
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:43,674
and they never complained about any hostile organism.
What do you mean? What people?

140
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:46,885
Terraformers.
Planet engineers.

141
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,722
They go in, set up these big atmosphere
processors to make the air breathable.

142
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,058
Takes decades.

143
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,394
It's what we call
a "Shake 'N Bake" colony.

144
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:59,106
How many are there?
How many colonists?

145
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,694
I don't know-60, maybe 70 families.
Do you mind?

146
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,365
Families.

147
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,619
Jesus.

148
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,322
I'll be down in maintenance, okay?
Al!

149
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,324
What?
Hey, Al.

150
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,618
What? Remember you sent
some wildcatters...

151
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,537
out to the middle of nowhere last
week, out past the Ilium Range?

152
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:41,500
- Yeah, what?
- One of them's on the horn, a mom-and-pop survey team.

153
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,336
He says he's onto something. He wants
to know if his claim will be honored.

154
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,463
Why wouldn't his claim
be honored?

155
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,633
Well, because you sent them to that particular
middle-of-nowhere on company orders, maybe.

156
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,261
I don't know. Christ! Some honch
in a cushy office on Earth...

157
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,472
says, "Go look at
a grid reference."

158
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,767
We look. They don't say
why, and I don't ask.

159
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:02,979
I don't ask, because it takes two weeks to get
an answer out here, and the answer is always-

160
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,940
"Don't ask."

161
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,192
So what do l tell this guy?

162
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,487
Tell him as far as I'm concerned,
if he finds something, it is his.

163
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,489
Lydecker?
What?

164
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,158
You kids know you're not
supposed to be on this level!

165
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,619
Go on!
Get outta here!

166
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:54,406
Do too. You go in places we can't fit.
So? That's why I'm the best.

167
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:59,161
Knock it off! I catch either of you playing
in the air ducts again, l'll tan your hides.

168
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,496
Mom, all the kids play-

169
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,166
Wait a minute. Annie, come and
have a look at this, will ya?

170
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:17,846
Folks, we have
scored big this time.

171
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,813
What is it, Dad?

172
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:33,361
I'm not sure.

173
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:37,328
Let's see if we can't get a closer look at this
thing, maybe through that crack there on the side.

174
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:41,495
- Shouldn't we call in?
- Let's wait till we know what to call it in as.

175
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,584
That's about as close
as we can get.

176
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,754
Should we take a look inside?

177
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:09,606
You two stay inside. I mean it.
We'll be right back.

178
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,733
Okay.
Bye.

179
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,477
Huh?

180
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,689
Timmy, they've been gone
a long time.

181
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,150
It'll be okay, Newt.
Dad knows what he's doing.

182
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:41,072
Mayday, Mayday! This is Alpha Kilo
Two Four Niner calling!

183
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:44,117
This is Alpha Kilo
Two Four Niner!

184
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,536
Alpha Kilo
Two Four Niner calling!

185
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,415
Hiya, Ripley.
This is Lieutenant Gorman...

186
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,627
of the Colonial
Marine Corps-

187
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,962
Ripley, we have to talk.

188
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:41,758
We've lost contact
with the colony on LV-426.

189
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,433
I don't believe this.

190
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,105
You guys throw me at the wolves, and
now you want me to go back out there?

191
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,774
Forget it.
It's not my problem.

192
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,486
Can I finish? No.
There's no way.

193
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,989
Ripley, you wouldn't be
going in with the troops.

194
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,409
I can guarantee your safety.

195
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,994
These Colonial Marines
are very tough hombres.

196
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,956
They're packing
state-of-the-art firepower.

197
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,361
There's nothing
they can't handle.

198
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,919
- Lieutenant, am I right?
- That's true.

199
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,171
We've been trained to deal
with situations like this.

200
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:23,925
Then you don't need me.
I'm not a soldier.

201
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,594
Yeah, but we don't know exactly
what's going on out there.

202
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,305
It mayjust be a downed
transmitter, okay?

203
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,852
But if it's not, I would like
you there as an adviser,

204
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,979
and that's all.

205
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:40,817
What's your interest in all this?
Why are you going?

206
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,945
Corporation cofinanced
that colony,

207
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,531
along with
Colonial Administration.

208
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,451
We're getting into a lot of terraforming now.
"Building Better Worlds"-

209
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,036
Yeah, yeah.
I saw the commercial.

210
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:55,039
Look, I don't have time for this.
I've got to get to work.

211
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:58,251
Oh, right. I heard you're
working the cargo docks.

212
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,336
That's right.

213
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:03,131
Running loaders and forklifts,
that sort of thing? Yeah. So?

214
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,384
Nothing. I think it's great
that you're keeping busy.

215
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:08,970
And I know it's the only
thing that you could get.

216
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,889
There's nothing wrong with it.

217
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,603
What would you say if I told you
I could get you reinstated...

218
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,646
as a flight officer?

219
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:23,234
The company's already agreed to
pick up your contract. If I go.

220
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,279
Yeah, if you go.

221
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,531
Come on.
That's a second chance, kiddo.

222
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:31,416
I think, personally, for you, it would
be the best thing in the world...

223
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:34,329
to get out there and face this
thing, get back on the horse.

224
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,332
Spare me, Burke. I've had my
psych evaluation this month.

225
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:41,544
Yeah, I know. I've read it. You wake up every night.
Your sheets are soaking with sweat-

226
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,880
I said no, and I mean it!

227
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,552
Now, please leave.
I am not going back.

228
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:52,972
And I am-I would not be
any good to you if I did.

229
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:56,142
Okay. Shh.

230
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:01,064
Would you do me a favor?
Just think about it.

231
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,194
Thanks for the coffee.

232
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,715
Oh!

233
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,180
Hello.

234
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:18,975
Ripley.

235
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:22,645
You okay? Just tell
me one thing, Burke.

236
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,024
You're going out there
to destroy them, right?

237
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:31,029
Not to study, not to bring back,
but to wipe them out.

238
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:35,158
That's the plan.
You have my word on it.

239
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:38,911
All right. I'm in.

240
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:40,955
I think that-

241
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:51,424
And you, you little shithead,

242
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,344
you're staying here.

243
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,230
Mmm.

244
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:30,374
They ain't payin' us
enough for this, man.

245
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:32,877
Not enough to have to wake
up to your face, Drake.

246
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:33,461
What?

247
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,088
Is that a joke?

248
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:38,257
Oh, I wish it were.

249
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:43,262
Hey, Hicks. Man, you look
just like I feel.

250
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:47,225
All right, sweethearts.
What are you waiting for?

251
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:50,436
Breakfast in bed? Another
glorious day in the corps.

252
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:54,023
A day in the Marine Corps
is like a day on the farm-

253
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:59,070
every meal's a banquet, every paycheck
a fortune, every formation a parade.

254
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:00,863
I love the corps!
Christ!

255
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:02,782
Man, this floor is freezing!

256
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:07,078
What do you want me to do? Fetch your slippers for ya?
Gee, would you, sir? I'd like that.

257
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,414
Look into my eye.
Fall in, people.

258
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,750
Come on. Let's go.

259
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,794
I hate this job.

260
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,588
Crowe, Wierzbowski. Come on. On your feet.
We got some slack coming, right?

261
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:20,550
You had three weeks on your back, Frost.
What do you want?

262
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:23,010
I'm talking about breathing,
not this frozen shit.

263
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,388
Yeah, Top. How 'bout it?

264
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:32,687
All right. First assembly's
in 15, people. Shag it.

265
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,566
Hey, mira.
Who's Snow White?

266
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:40,111
She's supposed to be
some kind of consultant.

267
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,446
Apparently,
she saw an alien once.

268
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:45,575
Whoopee-fuckin'-do!
Hey, I'm impressed.

269
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,702
IQue bonita!

270
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:54,166
Hey, Vasquez. Have you ever
been mistaken for a man?

271
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:56,294
No. Have you?

272
00:29:56,378 --> 00:30:01,215
Ha, ha! Oh, Vasquez.
You're just too bad.

273
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,634
Uhh!

274
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,604
Hey, Top, what's the op?

275
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,814
It's a rescue mission.
You'll love it.

276
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:21,611
There's some juicy colonists' daughters
we have to rescue from their virginity.

277
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,863
Dumb-ass colonists.

278
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,077
What's this crap supposed to be?
Vasquez.

279
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:33,289
Corn bread, I think. It's
good for you, boy. Eat it.

280
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,375
Hey, sure wouldn't mind getting some
more of that Arcturian poontang.

281
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:41,589
- Remember that time?
- Yeah. Except the one that you had was male.

282
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,258
Doesn't matter
when it's Arcturian.

283
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,802
Hey, Bishop, man. Do the thing
with the knife. Oh, please.

284
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,347
Oh, come on. Yeah.

285
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,390
All right! Yeah.

286
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:55,061
- I don't want to see that, man.
- Come on, man. All right. All right.

287
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:58,105
Hey, what are you doing, man?
What are you doing?

288
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,358
Come on. Quit messing around, Drake.
Hudson, shut up!

289
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:03,027
- Bishop, hey, man.
- Do it, Bishop!

290
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:06,697
Hey! Not me, man! Quit messing around!
Yeah, you! Don't move.

291
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:09,075
Trust me.

292
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,286
Aah!

293
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:23,756
All right. Knock it off,
knock it off.

294
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,841
Thank you.

295
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,304
There you go, short shit.
Enjoy your meal.

296
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:33,140
That wasn't funny, man.

297
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:39,814
Lieutenant Gorman? Mr. Burke?
Yeah, thanks.

298
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:45,069
Looks like the new lieutenant's too
good to eat with the rest of us grunts.

299
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:49,657
Boy's definitely got
a corncob up his ass.

300
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,452
Thought you never miss, Bishop.

301
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,542
You never said anything about an
android being on board. Why not?

302
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:03,671
It never-
never occurred to me.

303
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,841
It's just common practice. We
always have a synthetic on board.

304
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,385
I prefer the term
"artificial person" myself.

305
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,345
Right.

306
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,098
- Is there a problem?
- I'm sorry.

307
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,100
I don't know why
I didn't even-

308
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:19,603
Ripley's last trip out, the syn-the
artificial person malfunctioned.

309
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:24,567
- Malfunctioned?
- There were problems and a few deaths were involved.

310
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,862
I'm shocked.
Was it an older model?

311
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,614
The Hyperdyne Systems
1 20-A2.

312
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,284
That explains it then. The A2s
always were a bit twitchy.

313
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,078
That could never happen now
with our behavioral inhibitors.

314
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:40,750
It is impossible for me to harm, or by omission
ofaction, allow to be harmed, a human being.

315
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:45,045
- You sure you don't want some?

316
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,715
You just stay away from me,
Bishop. You got that straight?

317
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,846
Guess she don't like
the corn bread, either.

318
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:11,322
Squad, ten-hut! Officer on deck!
As you were.

319
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,241
Quickly, quickly.
Settle down.

320
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:17,328
All right.
Listen up!

321
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:22,458
Morning, marines. l'm sorry we didn't have time
to brief you people before we left Gateway-

322
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:25,044
Sir?
What is it, Hicks?

323
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:28,214
Hudson, sir.
He's Hicks.

324
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:31,217
What's the question?

325
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:35,095
Is this gonna be a stand-up
fight, sir, or another bug hunt?

326
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:39,266
All we know is that there's still
no contact with the colony...

327
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:42,186
and that a xenomorph
may be involved.

328
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:45,022
Excuse me, sir. A what?
A xenomorph.

329
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,358
It's a bug hunt.

330
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:52,154
- What exactly are we dealing with here?
- Ripley.

331
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,657
I'll tell you what I know.

332
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,159
We set down
on LV-426.

333
00:33:57,244 --> 00:34:01,247
One ofour crew members was brought back on
board with something attached to his face,

334
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:03,833
some kind of parasite.

335
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:06,252
We tried to get it off.
It wouldn't come off.

336
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:09,255
Later, it seemed to come off
by itselfand die.

337
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,882
Kane seemed fine.

338
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:14,093
We were all having dinner,
and, um,

339
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:18,305
it must have laid something inside
his throat, some sort of embryo.

340
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:22,393
He started-Um, he-
Look, man.

341
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:27,523
I only need to know one
thing-where they are.

342
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,401
Yo, Vasquez. Kick ass.
Anytime, anywhere.

343
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:35,322
Right, right. Somebody said "alien." She thought
they said "illegal alien" and signed up.

344
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,408
Fuck you, man.
Anytime, anywhere.

345
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,119
Are you finished?

346
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:48,002
I hope you're right.
I really do.

347
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:53,299
Yeah, okay, right.
Thank you, Ripley.

348
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:56,302
We also have Ripley's report on disk.
I suggest you study it.

349
00:34:56,428 --> 00:35:01,307
Because just one of those things managed to
wipe out my entire crew in less than 24 hours.

350
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:04,143
And if the colonists have found that
ship, then there's no telling...

351
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,895
how many of them
have been exposed.

352
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:08,397
Do you understand?

353
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,402
Anyway, we have it on disk,
so you better look at it.

354
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,155
Any questions?

355
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,616
What is it, Private?

356
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,702
How do I get out of this
chickenshit outfit?

357
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,537
You secure that shit, Hudson.

358
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,292
All right.

359
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,211
Now listen up.

360
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,715
I want this thing
to go smooth...

361
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,343
and by the numbers.

362
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:41,847
I want D.C.S. and tactical
database assimilation by 0830.

363
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,934
Ordinance loading, weapons strip
and drop-ship prep details...

364
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,436
will have seven hours.
Oh, come on.

365
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,688
Now, move it, people!

366
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:52,483
All right, sweethearts. You heard
the man, and you know the drill.

367
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:56,779
Assholes and elbows! Hudson, come here.
Come here.

368
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,004
I don't care if you are short, Hudson.
Get it done.

369
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:16,674
Hey, Sarge. You'll get lip
cancer smoking those.

370
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:19,885
Corporal, I want this
loading lock sealed. Now!

371
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,429
How many more you got, Spunkmeyer?
Last one.

372
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,556
Good. Take it away.

373
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:44,076
Clear behind.

374
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,876
Did you check number three?
Let me see that.

375
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:56,880
Hi. I feel like kind of a fifth wheel around here.
Is there anything I can do?

376
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,341
I don't know. Is there
anything you can do?

377
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,555
Well, I can drive that loader.

378
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:08,308
I have a Class 2 rating.

379
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,477
Be my guest.

380
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:59,943
Where you want it?

381
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:03,489
Bay 12, please.

382
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:03,298
All right, sweethearts. We're a team,
and there's nothing to worry about.

383
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:06,885
We come here, and we gonna
conquer, and we gonna kick some.

384
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,888
Is that understood? That's what we
gonna do, sweethearts. Yes, sir.

385
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:12,307
We are going to go and get some.
Hey.

386
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:15,144
All right, people!
On the ready line!

387
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,021
Are you lean? Are you mean?
Yeah! Yeah!

388
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:20,774
What are you? What are you?
Lean and mean!

389
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:23,652
Hudson! Get on the
ready line, marine!

390
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:26,655
Get some today!
Get on the ready line!

391
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,700
Yo! Move it out! Move
it out, goddamn it!

392
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:33,370
Get hot! One, two, three!
Get out, get out, get out!

393
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:36,999
Move it out, move it out, move it out!
Move it out, move it out, move it out!

394
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:43,380
Absolutely badasses.

395
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,883
Let's pack 'em in.
Get in there!

396
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,926
All right! Move it!

397
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,721
Let's go, let's go!
One, two, three,

398
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:54,266
four, five, six!

399
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:58,729
All right. I want combat seating.
You know your places.

400
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,106
Get those weapons stowed.
Let's go.

401
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:04,526
Come on.
Settle down, people.

402
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:06,695
Lock 'em in, Hudson.

403
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:10,199
Ready to get it on?
You know it!

404
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:12,951
Okay, Bishop, let's go.

405
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:15,204
Roger.

406
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:19,708
I'm ready, man.

407
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:23,337
- Ready to get it on!
- Go!

408
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:31,470
Stand by. Cross-locking now.
Prelaunch autocycle engaged.

409
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:38,727
Primary couplers released.
Hit the internals.

410
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,991
Shit, man. Confirm cross-lock
and drop stations secured.

411
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:57,204
Affirmative.
All drop stations secured.

412
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,418
Stand by. Ten seconds.

413
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:10,092
Stand by to initiate release sequencer...
on my mark.

414
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:14,846
- Five, four, three,
- We're on an express elevator to hell, going down.

415
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:17,891
Two, one, mark.

416
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,436
Woo-hoo!

417
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:38,078
- Switch to D.C.S. ranging.
- 240, nominal to profile.

418
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,872
We're in the pipe,
five by five.

419
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,760
We're picking up
some hull ionization.

420
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:56,305
Got it.
Rough air ahead.

421
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:58,640
We're in for some chop.

422
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,614
How many drops is this
for you, Lieutenant?

423
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,369
Thirty-eight.

424
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,413
Simulated.

425
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,623
How many combat drops?

426
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:27,753
Uh, two...
including this one.

427
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:31,173
- Shit.
- Oh, man!

428
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:48,065
Range 014.
Turning on final.

429
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:55,822
And I'm telling you, I got a
bad feeling about this drop.

430
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:59,326
You always say that, Frost. You always say,
"I got a bad feeling about this drop."

431
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,828
Okay, okay.
When we get back without you,

432
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,956
I'll call your folks.

433
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:11,338
All right.
Let's see what we can see.

434
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:14,883
Everybody online.
Looking good.

435
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,012
Drake, check your camera. There
seems to be a malfunction.

436
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:23,683
That's better.
Pan it around a bit.

437
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,853
- Good.
- I'm ready, man. Check it out.

438
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:30,023
I am the ultimate badass.
Yeah. That's right.

439
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:35,570
State-of-the-badass art. You do not want
to fuck with me. Who here's runnin'?

440
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:38,532
Check it out.

441
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,494
Hey, Ripley, don't worry.

442
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:45,705
Me and my squad of ultimate
badasses will protect you.

443
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,707
Hey!
That's right.

444
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,960
Check it out.

445
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:53,588
Independently targeting
particle-beam phalanx.

446
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:57,300
Fry halfa city with this puppy.

447
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:59,761
We got tactical smart missiles,

448
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:02,264
phase-plasma pulse rifles,
R.P.G.'s.

449
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:05,809
- We got sonic, electronic ball breakers!
- - Whoo!

450
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:09,229
We got nukes, we got knives,
sharp sticks-

451
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,232
Knock it off, Hudson.
All right, gear up.

452
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:16,111
Two minutes, people.
Get hot.

453
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,904
Somebody wake up Hicks.

454
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:33,837
Coming around for a 709er.

455
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:36,840
Terminal guidance locked in.
Where's the damn beacon?

456
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,426
Oh, I see it.

457
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,894
That's the atmosphere processor?
Yep, that's it.

458
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:52,272
Remarkable piece of machinery.
Completely automated.

459
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,900
You know, we manufacture
those, by the way.

460
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:09,748
Okay, Ferro. Take us in low
over the main colony complex.

461
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,543
Storm shutters are sealed.

462
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:16,213
There's no visible activity.
All right. Hold at 40.

463
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:20,467
Roger.
Give me a slow circle of the complex.

464
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:32,687
Structure seems intact.
They still have power.

465
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:36,983
Okay, Ferro. Set down
on the landing grid.

466
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,986
Immediate dust off on my
clear, then stay on station.

467
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,336
Down and clear.

468
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:59,673
Ten seconds, people.
Look sharp.

469
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:06,054
All right. I want a nice,
clean dispersal this time.

470
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,808
Let's go!
Move it out!

471
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,893
Head 'em up!

472
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:37,002
First squad up on line. Hicks, get
yours in accord and watch the rear.

473
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:40,714
Vasquez, take point.
Let's move!

474
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:50,056
Move up.

475
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:55,020
Hudson, run a bypass.

476
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:03,361
Second squad, move up.
Flanking positions.

477
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:06,156
Second squad on line.

478
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:36,269
You set?

479
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:41,316
Go on.

480
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:09,678
Second team, move inside.
Hicks, take the upper level.

481
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:42,711
Sir, you copying this? Looks
like hits from small-arms fire.

482
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:45,880
Uh, we got some
explosives damage.

483
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:48,216
It's probably seismic
survey charges.

484
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:52,095
Are you reading this?
Keep it tight, people.

485
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,320
All right. Hicks, Hudson,
use your motion trackers.

486
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:30,467
Nothing.
Not a goddamn thing.

487
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:38,224
Quarter and search by twos.

488
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,614
Okay. Dietrich,
Frost, you're up.

489
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:41,621
It's right in there.

490
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:54,842
Now!
Now!

491
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:59,722
- Haah! Uh-
- Good one, Hudson!

492
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:04,936
Uh, sir, uh, we have a negative situation here.
Uh, movin' on, sir

493
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:16,948
Wait. Wait,
tell him to-

494
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:21,661
Hicks, back up.
Pan right.

495
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:28,418
- There.
- You seeing this all right?

496
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:34,048
Looks melted. Somebody must have
bagged one of Ripley's bad guys here.

497
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:36,092
Acid for blood.

498
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:39,762
If you like that,
you're gonna love this.

499
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,652
Quit screwing around.

500
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:56,487
Second squad,
what's your status?

501
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:59,699
Uh, we just finished our sweep.
Nobody's home.

502
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:02,368
Roger.
Sir, this place is dead.

503
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:05,079
Whatever happened here,
I think we missed it.

504
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:09,167
All right. The area's secured. Let's go in
and see what their computer can tell us.

505
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:12,086
- Wait a minute. It's not secure.
- The area's secured, Ripley.

506
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:13,963
First team,
head for operations.

507
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:18,301
Hudson, see if you can get their C.P.U.
on line. Affirmative.

508
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:21,888
Hicks, meet me at the south lock.
We're coming in. Roger.

509
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:25,266
He's comin' in.
I feel safer already.

510
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:27,393
Pendejo jerk-off.

511
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:51,417
Sir, we got the C.P.U. on line.
No problem.

512
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:54,212
Good. Stand by
in Operations.

513
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:57,256
Okay, let's go.

514
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,278
Are you all right?

515
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:22,156
Yes.

516
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:42,760
Sir, they sealed off
this wing at both ends,

517
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:46,097
welded the doors and blocked off
the stairs with heavy equipment.

518
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:50,184
Mm-hmm. But it looks like
the barricade didn't hold.

519
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,437
Any bodies?
No, sir.

520
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:54,439
Last stand.

521
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:56,983
Must have been
a hell ofa fight.

522
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,694
Yeah, looks that way.

523
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,739
All right, Drake, this way.

524
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:06,826
We should be able to cut through
the medlab to Operations.

525
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:00,546
Lieutenant.

526
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:04,383
Gorman.

527
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:22,944
Are those the same ones that-

528
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:38,251
Careful, Burke.

529
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:51,764
Looks like love
at first sight to me.

530
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,183
Oh, he likes you, Burke.

531
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:56,894
Two are alive.
The rest are dead.

532
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:01,732
"Surgically removed
before embryo implantation.

533
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:06,529
Subject Marachek, John J.,
died during the procedure."

534
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:09,031
They killed him taking it off.

535
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:13,286
Yo, Hicks.

536
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,913
I think we got something here.

537
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:22,628
Behind us.
One of us?

538
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:27,425
Apone, where are your people?
Anybody in "D" block?

539
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:30,344
Ah, that's a negative.
We're all in Operations.

540
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,391
Talk to me, Frosty.

541
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,435
Let's keep moving, baby.

542
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:57,830
It's moving.
Which way?

543
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:01,459
It's coming straight for us.
Straight up.

544
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:40,956
Fuck!
Hold up.

545
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,043
Ripley.

546
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:06,649
Hey. Shh.
It's all right.

547
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:09,026
It's all right. Come on.
Just grab her, Corporal.

548
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:12,196
Don't be afraid. Come on.
We won't hurt you.

549
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,573
Shh. It's all right.
It's okay.

550
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:16,826
Come on out. Come on.

551
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,994
- Easy. Easy.
- I got her.

552
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:20,996
Ow! Damn!

553
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:23,833
Watch her! She's under the grille!
Don't let her go.

554
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:27,253
Frost, get your light up here.
Where'd she go?

555
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:33,968
Shine the light.
Here. Here.

556
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:35,803
Here. Here.
There she is.

557
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:38,472
Keep back. Keep back.
Don't scare her.

558
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:41,267
Grab her, man. We're gonna lose her.
Damn it!

559
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:45,479
Kick it out!

560
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:49,692
Wait.

561
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:18,304
It's okay.
It's all right.

562
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:23,100
Don't be afraid.

563
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:25,227
See?

564
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:27,271
- Wait.
- No, you don't.

565
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:30,816
It's okay. You're gonna
be all right now.

566
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:32,985
Shh.

567
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:37,239
Easy. Easy.
It's gonna be okay.

568
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:39,825
It's all right.
You're gonna be okay.

569
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:41,952
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

570
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:45,122
Easy. Easy.

571
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:23,619
What's her name again?
Rebecca.

572
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:27,665
Now think, Rebecca.
Concentrate.

573
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:30,584
Just start at the beginning.

574
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:33,712
Where are your parents?

575
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:36,006
Now, look, Rebecca,
you have to try and help-

576
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:38,717
Gorman, give it a rest,
why don't you?

577
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:43,806
Total brain lock.

578
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,808
Physically, she's okay.

579
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:49,103
Borderline malnutrition, but I don't
think there's any permanent damage.

580
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:51,605
Come on.
We're wasting our time.

581
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:03,492
Try this.

582
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:05,911
It's a little hot chocolate.

583
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:09,832
There you go.

584
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,126
Whoop.

585
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,169
That good, huh?

586
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:22,011
Uh-oh. I made
a clean spot here.

587
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:25,890
Now I've done it. Guess l'll
have to do the whole thing.

588
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:38,986
Hard to believe there's a
little girl under all this.

589
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:43,157
And a pretty one too.

590
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:49,788
You don't talk much, do you?

591
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:00,758
Smoking or nonsmoking?

592
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:02,760
Just tell me what
you're scanning for, Private.

593
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:04,762
P.D.T.s.
What?

594
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:06,764
Personal data transmitters.

595
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,391
Every colonist had one
surgically implanted.

596
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:12,645
If they're within 20 klicks,
we'll read it out here.

597
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,897
So far, zippo.

598
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:17,900
I don't know how you
managed to stay alive,

599
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:20,361
but you're one
brave kid, Rebecca.

600
01:02:22,364 --> 01:02:24,323
N-Newt.

601
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:29,828
- What'd you say?
- Newt.

602
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:32,122
My name's Newt.

603
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:37,336
Nobody calls me Rebecca
except my brother.

604
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:41,298
Newt?
I like that.

605
01:02:41,383 --> 01:02:45,177
I'm Ripley.
It's nice to meet you.

606
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:50,265
And who is this, hmm?

607
01:02:50,392 --> 01:02:54,103
Casey.
Hello, Casey.

608
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:57,147
What about your brother?
What's his name?

609
01:02:57,232 --> 01:02:59,274
Timmy.

610
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:03,821
Is Timmy around here too?
Maybe hiding like you were?

611
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:08,826
Any sisters?

612
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,373
Mom and dad?

613
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:21,463
Newt, look at me.
Where are they?

614
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:24,591
They're dead, all right?
Can I go now?

615
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:30,180
I'm sorry, Newt.

616
01:03:30,265 --> 01:03:32,850
Don't you think you'd
be safer here with us?

617
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:38,772
These people are here
to protect you.

618
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:40,816
They're soldiers.

619
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,736
It won't make any difference.

620
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:59,251
Need anything else?

621
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:04,757
Hello, Bishop. Do you
need anything else?

622
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:08,677
No.

623
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:12,890
That's a nice pet
you got there, Bishop.

624
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:15,893
Magnificent, isn't it?

625
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:20,981
Yo! Stop your grinnin'
and drop your linen! Found 'em.

626
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:23,650
They alive?
Unknown,

627
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:25,652
but it looks like all of them.

628
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:29,907
Over at the processing station,
Sublevel 3,

629
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:32,451
under the main cooling towers.

630
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:36,288
Looks like
a goddamn town meeting.

631
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:38,290
Let's saddle up, Apone.

632
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:40,667
Aye, sir.

633
01:04:40,752 --> 01:04:43,337
All right. Let's go, people. They
ain't payin' us by the hour.

634
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:45,380
Let's go.
Head 'em out!

635
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:47,466
Okay, Frost, you're driving.

636
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:02,731
It's okay. Don't worry.
It'll be okay.

637
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:47,276
I want a straight "V" deployment,
second team on left flank.

638
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:51,405
Advance on axial 664.
Tracker on line.

639
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:54,616
Set the "V" gain
to filter R.F. ambient.

640
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:58,203
Hudson, tracker on line.
Left and right, little buddy.

641
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:04,209
Forty meters in, bearing 221,
there should be a stairwell.

642
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:06,253
Check. Got it.

643
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:09,631
You want Sublevel 3.

644
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:14,094
Let's go, people.
Hudson, you got the point.

645
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:16,555
Hicks, watch our tails.

646
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,808
Nice and easy.
Check those corners.

647
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:22,144
Check those corners.

648
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:28,150
Watch your spacing. All right.
You heard the man.

649
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,152
Don't bunch up.
Stay loose.

650
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:32,988
Uh, your transmission's
showing a lot ofbreakup.

651
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:37,284
Probably getting some
interference from the structure.

652
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:39,494
Use those lights.

653
01:06:39,579 --> 01:06:43,957
Next one down,
and proceed on a 216.

654
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:46,210
Uh, roger. That's a 216.

655
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:51,423
I'm not making that out
too well. What is it, Hudson?

656
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:54,468
You tell me, man.
I only work here.

657
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:11,652
What is that?

658
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:13,946
I don't know.

659
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:17,950
Proceed inside.

660
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:36,635
Watch your fire
and check your targets.

661
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:39,054
Remember we're looking
for civvies in here.

662
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:50,774
Easy.

663
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:53,318
Tighten it up, Frost.
We're getting a little thin.

664
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:57,406
Nice and easy.

665
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:01,618
Looks like some sort
of secreted resin.

666
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:05,497
Yeah, but secreted from what?

667
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:08,250
Nobody touch nothing.

668
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:11,295
Busy little creatures, huh?

669
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:13,630
Hot as hell in here.

670
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:15,632
Yeah, man, but it's a dry heat.

671
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:17,676
Knock it off, Hudson.

672
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:28,937
Lieutenant, what do
those pulse rifles fire?

673
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:31,398
Ten millimeter
explosive-tip caseless.

674
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:33,442
Standard light
armor-piercing round.

675
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:35,777
Why? Well, look
where your team is.

676
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:39,114
They're right under the
primary heat exchangers.

677
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:41,199
So?

678
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:44,995
So if they fire their weapons in there,
won't they rupture the cooling system?

679
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:49,333
- Ho, ho, ho. Yeah. She's absolutely right.
- So? So what?

680
01:08:49,417 --> 01:08:53,628
Look. This whole station is
basically a big fusion reactor.

681
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:56,089
Right?

682
01:08:56,174 --> 01:09:00,844
So you're talking about a thermonuclear
explosion, and adios, muchachos.

683
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:03,555
Oh, great. Wonderful.

684
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:06,433
Shit!

685
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:12,230
Look.
Uh... Apone.

686
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:16,985
Look. We can't have
any firing in there.

687
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:20,822
I, uh, I want you to collect
magazines from everybody.

688
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:24,951
- Is he fuckin' crazy?
- What the hell are we supposed to use, man, harsh language?

689
01:09:25,036 --> 01:09:27,871
- Flame units only. I want rifles slung.
- Sir, I-

690
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:30,916
Just do it, Sergeant.
And no grenades.

691
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:36,713
All right, sweethearts. You heard the man.
Pull 'em out. Come on. Let's have 'em.

692
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:40,425
Come on, Vasquez.
Clear and lock.

693
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:45,597
Damn!

694
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:47,808
You too. Give it up, Ski.
Come on. Let's go.

695
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:50,852
Crowe, I want it now.
Give it up.

696
01:09:50,937 --> 01:09:52,896
Right on, Vas.

697
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:56,066
Let's go, marine.
Give it up.

698
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,276
Frost, you got the duty.
Open that bag.

699
01:09:58,361 --> 01:10:01,238
- Thanks a lot, Sarge.
- Hicks, cover our ass.

700
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:03,240
Head 'em out, people.

701
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:08,912
I like to keep this handy...
for close encounters.

702
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:10,914
I heard that.

703
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:21,758
Any movement?

704
01:10:21,843 --> 01:10:24,511
Nothing. Zip.

705
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,651
Holy shit.

706
01:10:52,457 --> 01:10:54,958
Newt, go sit up front.

707
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:57,544
Go on! Now!

708
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:28,950
Steady, people.
Let's finish our sweep.

709
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:32,454
We're still marines,
and we got a job to do.

710
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:36,249
Keep it moving. Easy.

711
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:09,866
- Help!
- What?

712
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:12,702
Top, get over here. We got a live one!
You're gonna be all right.

713
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:15,956
Please... k-kill me.

714
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,917
Just stay calm.
We're gonna get you outta here.

715
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:21,586
It's gonna be all right. Give me a hand.
We gotta get her outta here.

716
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:24,047
- What is it, Dietrich?
- Convulsion!

717
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:26,800
Dietrich, get back!

718
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:29,261
Get back!

719
01:12:36,394 --> 01:12:39,688
- No!
- Frost, flamethrower. Kill it!

720
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:42,399
Get back!
Flamethrower! Move!

721
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:13,930
Movement!

722
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:18,768
- What's the position?
- I can't lock in!

723
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:21,229
Talk to me, Hudson!

724
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:24,482
Multiple signals.

725
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:26,693
They're closing.

726
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:30,071
Go to infrared, people.
Look sharp!

727
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:33,491
What's happening, Apone?
Can't see anything in here.

728
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:35,493
Pull your team out, Gorman.

729
01:13:41,334 --> 01:13:44,085
I got signals. I got readings
in front and behind.

730
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:46,379
Where, man?
I don't see shit.

731
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:48,965
He's right.
There's nothing back here.

732
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:51,610
Look, I'm telling you. There's
something moving, and it ain't us!

733
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:56,556
- Oh, shit.
- Tracker's off scale, man.

734
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:59,934
They're all
around us, man! Jesus!

735
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:02,937
Maybe they don't show up
on infrared at all.

736
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:15,659
Frost!

737
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:21,748
Come on!

738
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:30,799
Jesus Christ, Apone!
What is going on?

739
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:33,802
Wierzbowski and Crowe are down!

740
01:14:33,928 --> 01:14:37,931
Dietrich, Crowe! Sound off! Frost!
Dietrich, Frost, off the board!

741
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:40,600
Frost!

742
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:45,814
Wierzbowski?

743
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:48,608
Wierzbowski?

744
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:52,404
Let's rock!

745
01:14:55,116 --> 01:14:56,741
Who's firing?
Goddamn it!

746
01:14:57,743 --> 01:14:58,952
Yeah!

747
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:03,123
- I ordered to hold fire.
- They're coming out of the walls!

748
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:05,542
They're coming out of the goddamn walls!
Let's book!

749
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:07,877
On the right, man.
Uh, Apone,

750
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:10,714
I want you to lay down
a suppressing fire with the incinerators-

751
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:13,550
Vasquez, Drake, hold
your fire, goddamn it!

752
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:17,554
Apone, are you copying me?
I want you to lay down suppressing fire...

753
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:20,140
with the incinerators and fall
back by squads to the A.P.C.

754
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:22,642
Over. Say again, all
after "incinerator."

755
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:27,397
I said I want you to lay down a suppressing
fire with the incinerators and fall back...

756
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:30,066
- by squads to the A.P.C.
- Over.

757
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:32,026
Hey!

758
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:36,406
- Sarge! Sarge!
- Apone.

759
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:38,908
Talk to me. Apone?
Copy! Copy!

760
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:41,286
Talk to me, Apone.
He's gone!

761
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:45,331
Get them out of there!
Shut up!

762
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:48,334
Do it now! Hicks, whoever's
left, get-Shut up!

763
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:50,336
Just shut up!
Goddamn it!

764
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:54,883
It's coming out of the goddamn walls!
Where's Apone? Where's Apone?

765
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:57,260
The sarge is gone!
Let's get the fuck out of here!

766
01:15:57,344 --> 01:16:01,139
Let's move it!
Let's go, marine!

767
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:04,309
Hudson? Vasquez?

768
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:07,520
Hudson, look out!
Get it!

769
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:10,648
Watch it!

770
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:13,109
Hicks. Come on. Behind you!
Fall back!

771
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:16,696
- I told them to fall back.
- Fall back, goddamn it, now!

772
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:18,698
- They're cut off!
- Hudson, move your ass!

773
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:20,700
- Do something!
- Let's go, marine!

774
01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:22,744
Fuck!

775
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:25,830
Come on. Keep moving, baby.
Hold on, Newt.

776
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:34,881
Ripley, what the hell
are you doing?

777
01:16:40,805 --> 01:16:42,514
Turn around!

778
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:48,269
That's an order!

779
01:16:51,774 --> 01:16:55,235
Get offme, damn it!
Goddamn it, that's an order!

780
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:58,029
You had your chance, Gorman.

781
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:11,292
Come on!

782
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:33,481
Come on. Let's move it!

783
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:35,900
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

784
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:39,445
It's blocked, man.
We gotta go around!

785
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:44,325
- Open the door! Hicks!
- Drake, we are leaving!

786
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:46,411
Get them, man!

787
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:49,873
Run for it!

788
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:53,418
Shit!

789
01:17:56,171 --> 01:17:59,424
- Go! Go!
- Come on, man! Come on!

790
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:11,394
Drake, come on!

791
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:16,149
No!

792
01:18:18,235 --> 01:18:21,070
- Fire in the hole!
- He's gone!

793
01:18:21,155 --> 01:18:23,031
Put it out! Put it out!
Go! Go!

794
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:26,826
- Come on. Put it out!
- Drake's coming, man!

795
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:29,913
Drake! No, he's not! He's gone!

796
01:18:31,332 --> 01:18:33,291
Forget him!
He's gone!

797
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:41,049
They're in the goddamn door!

798
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:47,180
Eat this!

799
01:18:47,264 --> 01:18:50,350
Ripley!

800
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:52,769
Go, go, go!

801
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:57,458
It's all right!
We're clear!

802
01:19:57,543 --> 01:19:59,961
Ripley, you've blown
the transaxle!

803
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:01,963
You're just grinding metal!

804
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,257
Come on, ease down.

805
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:06,384
Ease down.

806
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:10,221
Ease down. Ease down.
Ease down.

807
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,152
You okay?

808
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:27,572
L'm all right.
Hudson.

809
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:29,699
Get away from me, man!

810
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:33,828
Lieutenant. What
happened to Gorman?

811
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:37,165
I don't know.
Maybe a concussion.

812
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:39,542
But he's alive.
He's dead!

813
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:41,711
Wake up, pendejo, and then
I'm gonna kill you!

814
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:45,006
Back off.
Right now.

815
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:49,635
Fuck! Somebody get
me a first aid kit.

816
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,847
Hey. Hey, look.

817
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:56,225
The sarge and Dietrich
aren't dead, man.

818
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:58,311
Their signs are real low,
but they ain't dead.

819
01:20:58,395 --> 01:21:00,646
- Then we go back in there and get them.
- Fuck that!

820
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:03,213
We don't leave our people behind—
I ain't going back in there.

821
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:05,693
You can't help them!

822
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:10,448
You can't. Right now they're being
cocooned just like the others.

823
01:21:14,745 --> 01:21:18,998
Oh, dear Lord Jesus, this ain't
happenin', man. Damn it.

824
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:22,168
This can't be happenin', man.
This isn't happenin'!

825
01:21:22,252 --> 01:21:25,797
All right. We got
seven canisters of CN-20.

826
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:29,217
I say we roll them in there and
nerve gas the whole fucking nest.

827
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:32,095
That's worth a try, but we don't
even know if it's gonna affect them.

828
01:21:32,179 --> 01:21:36,641
Let's just bug out and call it even. Okay?
What are we talking about this for?

829
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:40,436
I say we take off and nuke
the entire site from orbit.

830
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:45,233
It's the only way to be sure.

831
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:48,569
Fuckin' "A"! Hold on.
Hold on one second.

832
01:21:48,654 --> 01:21:52,824
This installation has a substantial
dollar value attached to it.

833
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:55,409
They can bill me.

834
01:21:55,494 --> 01:22:00,540
Okay, look. This is an emotional
moment for all of us, okay?

835
01:22:00,624 --> 01:22:04,043
I know that. But let's not
make snap judgments, please.

836
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:07,088
This is clearly-clearly an important
species we're dealing with,

837
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:09,924
and I don't think that you or
I or anybody has the right...

838
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:13,094
- to arbitrarily exterminate them.
- Wrong.

839
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:14,720
Yeah. Watch us.

840
01:22:14,805 --> 01:22:17,098
Maybe you haven't been
keeping up on current events,

841
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:19,851
but we just got
our asses kicked, pal!

842
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:23,271
Look. I'm not blind
to what's going on,

843
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:25,940
but I cannot authorize
that kind of action.

844
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:28,109
I'm sorry.

845
01:22:29,236 --> 01:22:32,155
Well, I believe
Corporal Hicks...

846
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:34,198
has authority here.

847
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:37,618
Corporal Hicks is-

848
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:40,079
This operation is under
military jurisdiction,

849
01:22:40,164 --> 01:22:42,081
and Hicks is next
in chain of command.

850
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:44,333
Am I right, Corporal?

851
01:22:44,418 --> 01:22:46,377
Yeah.

852
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:50,047
Yeah, that's right.

853
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:52,216
Yeah. Look, Ripley.
Yes.

854
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:54,760
This is a multimillion-dollar
installation, okay?

855
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:56,762
He can't make
that kind of decision.

856
01:22:56,847 --> 01:22:59,432
He's just a grunt.
Uh, no offense.

857
01:22:59,516 --> 01:23:03,269
None taken. Ferro, do you copy?
Standing by.

858
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:06,022
Prep for dust off. We're
gonna need immediate evac.

859
01:23:06,106 --> 01:23:08,024
Roger. On our way.

860
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:12,737
I say we take off, nuke the site from orbit.
It's the only way to be sure.

861
01:23:15,365 --> 01:23:17,116
Let's do it.

862
01:23:24,208 --> 01:23:27,752
Let's go. Pick it up, Hudson.
Pick it up, baby.

863
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:35,134
All right.
Set him down here.

864
01:23:41,725 --> 01:23:43,768
Move it, Spunkmeyer.
We're rolling.

865
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:50,858
Hold on a second.
There's something-

866
01:23:50,943 --> 01:23:53,236
Just get up here.

867
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:55,821
I'm in. Ramp closing.

868
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:17,510
Spunkmeyer.

869
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:22,390
Goddamn it.

870
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:24,809
Well, where the fuck-

871
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:39,490
Run!

872
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:24,160
Well, that's great.
That's just fuckin' great, man.

873
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:26,704
Now what the fuck
are we supposed to do?

874
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:29,081
We're in some
real pretty shit now, man!

875
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:31,542
Are you finished?

876
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:36,339
You all right?

877
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:45,765
I guess we're not gonna
be leaving now, right?

878
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:47,433
I'm sorry, Newt.

879
01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:51,479
You don't have to be sorry. It
wasn't your fault. That's it, man.

880
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:53,939
Game over, man!
Game over!

881
01:25:54,024 --> 01:25:56,650
What the fuck are we gonna do now?
What are we gonna do?

882
01:25:56,735 --> 01:26:01,155
Maybe we could build a fire. Sing a couple
of songs, huh? Why don't we try that?

883
01:26:01,239 --> 01:26:03,991
We'd better get back
'cause it'll be dark soon,

884
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:07,453
and they mostly
come at night, mostly.

885
01:26:24,262 --> 01:26:28,265
That's everything, right? All right.
This is absolutely everything...

886
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:31,352
that we could salvage
out of the A.P.C. wreckage.

887
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:35,022
We got four pulse rifles
with about 50 rounds each.

888
01:26:35,107 --> 01:26:37,233
That ain't so good.

889
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:41,028
We got, uh,
1 5 of these M-40 grenades.

890
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:43,030
Don't touch that.

891
01:26:43,156 --> 01:26:45,616
Dangerous, honey. Is that
the only flamethrower?

892
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:49,745
Yeah. It's only half full,
but it's functional.

893
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:53,582
Got another one, it's damaged—
I don't know about that one.

894
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:59,463
But the good news-we got
four of these robot sentries,

895
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:02,591
with display
and scanners intact.

896
01:27:02,676 --> 01:27:05,845
They really kick ass.
I think they'll come in handy.

897
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:10,349
How long after we're declared
overdue can we expect a rescue?

898
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:14,520
Seventeen days.

899
01:27:15,522 --> 01:27:18,065
Seventeen days?

900
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:22,027
Hey, man, I don't wanna rain on your
parade, but we're not gonna last 17 hours.

901
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:25,739
Those things are gonna come in here like they did before.
They're gonna come in here-

902
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:28,951
Hudson! Hudson! They're gonna come
in here and they're gonna get us!

903
01:27:29,035 --> 01:27:31,078
This little girl
survived longer than that...

904
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:34,206
with no weapons
and no training.

905
01:27:34,291 --> 01:27:36,208
Right?

906
01:27:38,587 --> 01:27:41,297
Why don't you
put her in charge?

907
01:27:41,381 --> 01:27:44,216
You'd better just start dealing
with it, Hudson. Listen to me.

908
01:27:44,301 --> 01:27:46,469
Hudson, just deal with it
because we need you.

909
01:27:46,553 --> 01:27:48,471
And I'm sick of your bullshit.

910
01:27:48,555 --> 01:27:52,141
Now, I want you to get on a terminal and
call up some kind of floor plan file.

911
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:54,935
Do you understand? Construction blueprints.
I don't care.

912
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:57,354
Anything that shows the layout of this place.
Are you listening?

913
01:27:57,481 --> 01:28:00,566
Yeah.
I need to see air ducts.

914
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:04,028
I need to see electrical
access tunnels, subbasements,

915
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:07,823
every possible way
into this complex.

916
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:12,369
- We don't have much time.
- Okay.

917
01:28:12,496 --> 01:28:14,788
Okay, I'm on it.
Hudson!

918
01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:19,543
Just relax.

919
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:28,010
I'll be in medlab. I'll check on
Gorman, continue my analysis.

920
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:31,013
Fine.
You do that.

921
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:41,065
So this service tunnel must be how
they're moving back and forth.

922
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:43,651
That's right. It moves from
the processing station...

923
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:46,070
right into the sublevel here.

924
01:28:48,114 --> 01:28:51,450
Come down on that.
Okay, come over.

925
01:28:51,535 --> 01:28:54,745
Hold. Go back. Okay, punch
that in right there.

926
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:02,461
No. It's back here.
Okay.

927
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:06,632
Well, there's a pressure
door at this end.

928
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:11,387
Couldn't we put one of the remote sentry
units in the tunnel and then seal that door?

929
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:14,473
Yeah, that'll work, but we gotta figure
on them getting into the complex.

930
01:29:14,558 --> 01:29:19,562
That's right, so we repair the
barricades at these two intersections.

931
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:22,356
Right. And weld plate
steel over these ducts...

932
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:26,819
here and here and here.

933
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:29,905
That way they can only come at
us from these two corridors.

934
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:35,661
All right. Then we put the other
sentry units here and here, right?

935
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:38,247
Right.
Outstanding.

936
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:40,291
Now all we need
is a deck of cards.

937
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:44,670
All right, people. Let's
move like we got a purpose.

938
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:47,548
Affirmative.
Affirmative.

939
01:30:02,814 --> 01:30:06,483
Do your thing, baby. Come on, Vasquez.
Let's get the hell outta here.

940
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:09,445
Hudson here. "A" and "B"
sentries are in place and keyed.

941
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:14,366
Roger. Stand by. Arming now.
Test it, Hudson.

942
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:16,869
Do it!
Fire in the hole!

943
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:22,916
Okay, great. Let's get
the hell outta here!

944
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:26,462
We're sealing the tunnel.
Come on, baby.

945
01:30:38,642 --> 01:30:40,559
For what it's worth.

946
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:44,813
Here. I want you
to put this on.

947
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:48,442
- What's it for?
- It's a locator.

948
01:30:48,526 --> 01:30:51,987
Then I can find you anywhere
in the complex on this.

949
01:30:53,823 --> 01:30:57,910
It's just a precaution. Thanks.

950
01:30:57,994 --> 01:31:00,788
Doesn't mean we're
engaged or anything.

951
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:02,873
All right, what's next?

952
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:34,530
Last stop.

953
01:31:38,535 --> 01:31:40,452
Get in.

954
01:31:40,537 --> 01:31:44,623
Scoot down.
That's good.

955
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:48,752
Now, you lie here and have a nap.
You're very tired.

956
01:31:48,837 --> 01:31:52,214
I don't want to.
I have scary dreams.

957
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:57,678
Well, I bet Casey doesn't
have scary dreams.

958
01:31:57,762 --> 01:31:59,680
Let's take a look.

959
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:02,099
Nope. Nothing bad
in there.

960
01:32:02,183 --> 01:32:06,478
See? Maybe you could
just try to be like her, hmm?

961
01:32:06,563 --> 01:32:09,064
Ripley, she doesn't
have bad dreams...

962
01:32:09,149 --> 01:32:12,192
because she's just
a piece of plastic.

963
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:15,779
Right.
I'm sorry, Newt.

964
01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:24,747
There.

965
01:32:24,831 --> 01:32:27,708
My mommy always said
there were no monsters-

966
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:31,128
no real ones-
but there are.

967
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:34,423
Yes, there are, aren't there?

968
01:32:36,509 --> 01:32:38,844
Why do they tell
little kids that?

969
01:32:40,722 --> 01:32:42,639
Most of the time it's true.

970
01:32:42,724 --> 01:32:46,185
Did one of those things
grow inside her?

971
01:32:46,269 --> 01:32:49,062
I don't know, Newt.

972
01:32:49,147 --> 01:32:51,106
That's the truth.

973
01:32:51,191 --> 01:32:55,778
Isn't that how babies come?
I mean, people babies?

974
01:32:55,904 --> 01:32:59,448
They grow inside you.
Oh, that's very different.

975
01:32:59,532 --> 01:33:01,450
Did you ever have a baby?

976
01:33:01,534 --> 01:33:04,828
Yes, I did.
I had a little girl.

977
01:33:04,954 --> 01:33:09,500
Where is she?
She's gone.

978
01:33:11,336 --> 01:33:13,295
You mean dead.

979
01:33:14,881 --> 01:33:15,839
Here.

980
01:33:17,217 --> 01:33:19,051
Take this.

981
01:33:20,553 --> 01:33:22,513
For luck.

982
01:33:25,725 --> 01:33:27,684
There's that.

983
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:31,772
Don't go, please.

984
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:35,400
Newt, I'm gonna be
right in the next room.

985
01:33:35,485 --> 01:33:37,402
And you see that camera
right up there?

986
01:33:37,487 --> 01:33:40,280
I can see you
right through that camera,

987
01:33:40,365 --> 01:33:42,699
all the time
to see if you're safe.

988
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:49,748
I'm not gonna leave you, Newt.

989
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:53,752
I mean that.
That's a promise.

990
01:33:53,837 --> 01:33:56,505
You promise?

991
01:33:56,589 --> 01:33:58,882
I cross my heart.

992
01:33:58,967 --> 01:34:03,262
- And hope to die?
- And hope to die.

993
01:34:18,152 --> 01:34:22,614
Now go to sleep,
and don't dream.

994
01:34:26,786 --> 01:34:28,745
Sneak.

995
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:41,758
The molecular acid oxidizes after the
creature's death, completely neutralizing it.

996
01:34:41,843 --> 01:34:45,262
Bishop, you know, that's very interesting, but
it doesn't really get us anywhere, does it?

997
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:47,890
I'm trying to figure out
what we're dealing with here.

998
01:34:47,974 --> 01:34:50,058
Let's go through it again.

999
01:34:50,143 --> 01:34:52,352
They grab the colonists,
they move them over there...

1000
01:34:52,437 --> 01:34:56,773
and they immobilize them
to be hosts for more of these.

1001
01:34:56,858 --> 01:35:00,694
Which would mean that there would have
to be a lot of these parasites, right?

1002
01:35:00,778 --> 01:35:02,946
One for each colonist.
That's over 100, at least.

1003
01:35:03,031 --> 01:35:04,948
Yes. Τhat follows.

1004
01:35:05,033 --> 01:35:09,077
But each one of these things
comes from an egg, right?

1005
01:35:11,623 --> 01:35:13,540
So who's laying these eggs?

1006
01:35:13,625 --> 01:35:16,710
I'm not sure.

1007
01:35:16,794 --> 01:35:18,754
It must be something
we haven't seen yet.

1008
01:35:18,838 --> 01:35:21,048
Hey, maybe it's like
an ant hive.

1009
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:23,175
Bees, man.
Bees have hives.

1010
01:35:23,259 --> 01:35:28,388
You know what I mean. There's, like,
one female that runs the whole show.

1011
01:35:28,514 --> 01:35:30,891
Yes, the queen.
Ueah, the mama.

1012
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:33,310
She's badass, man.
I mean, big.

1013
01:35:33,436 --> 01:35:35,979
These things ain't ants, estúpido.
I know that.

1014
01:35:36,064 --> 01:35:40,734
Bishop, I want these specimens destroyed
as soon as you're finished with them.

1015
01:35:40,818 --> 01:35:43,737
- Is that clear?
- Mr. Burke gave instructions...

1016
01:35:43,821 --> 01:35:47,658
that they were to be kept alive in
stasis for return to the company labs.

1017
01:35:49,869 --> 01:35:51,828
He was very specific about it.

1018
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:57,250
Look. Those two specimens are worth millions
to the bio-weapons division, right?

1019
01:35:57,335 --> 01:36:00,712
Now, if you're smart, we can
both come out of this heroes,

1020
01:36:00,797 --> 01:36:04,007
and we will be set up for life.

1021
01:36:05,051 --> 01:36:07,636
You're crazy, Burke.
Do you know that?

1022
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:11,890
Do you really think you can get a dangerous
organism like that past I.C.C. quarantine?

1023
01:36:11,974 --> 01:36:14,851
How can they impound it if
they don't know about it?

1024
01:36:14,936 --> 01:36:17,979
But they will know about it,
Burke, from me.

1025
01:36:18,064 --> 01:36:22,275
Just like they'll know that you were
responsible for the deaths of 157 colonists.

1026
01:36:22,402 --> 01:36:24,820
Wait a second. You sent
them to that ship.

1027
01:36:24,946 --> 01:36:27,030
You're wrong. I just
checked the colony log.

1028
01:36:27,115 --> 01:36:30,992
Directive dated 6-1 2-79,
signed Burke, Carter J.

1029
01:36:31,077 --> 01:36:33,995
You sent them out there,
and you didn't even warn them.

1030
01:36:34,122 --> 01:36:36,540
Why didn't you warn them, Burke?
Okay, look.

1031
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:39,184
What if that ship didn't even exist?
Do you ever think about that?

1032
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:42,879
I didn't know. So now if I went and made
a major security situation out of it,

1033
01:36:43,005 --> 01:36:46,383
everybody steps in, administration steps in,
and there's no exclusive rights for anybody.

1034
01:36:46,467 --> 01:36:50,512
Nobody wins. So I made a
decision, and it was wrong.

1035
01:36:50,596 --> 01:36:53,306
It was a bad call, Ripley.
It was a bad call.

1036
01:36:53,433 --> 01:36:55,100
Bad call?
Right.

1037
01:36:55,184 --> 01:36:56,810
These people are dead, Burke!

1038
01:36:56,894 --> 01:36:59,312
Don't you have any idea
what you've done here?

1039
01:36:59,397 --> 01:37:02,315
I'm gonna make sure that they nail
you right to the wall for this!

1040
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,651
You're not gonna sleaze
your way out of this one.

1041
01:37:04,736 --> 01:37:06,903
Right to the wall.

1042
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:11,783
Ripley. I-

1043
01:37:11,868 --> 01:37:13,869
You know, I expected
more from you.

1044
01:37:13,953 --> 01:37:16,913
I thought you'd be
smarter than this.

1045
01:37:16,998 --> 01:37:20,375
Well, I'm happy
to disappoint you.

1046
01:37:33,973 --> 01:37:36,349
What is it? What's going on?
They're coming.

1047
01:37:36,476 --> 01:37:38,935
Where?
In the tunnel.

1048
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:45,942
Here we go. "A" and "B" gun tracking far end.
Multiple targets.

1049
01:37:51,741 --> 01:37:53,617
Those ammo counters go.

1050
01:37:56,287 --> 01:37:58,413
"B" gun's down 50%..

1051
01:37:59,582 --> 01:38:01,833
Man, it's a shooting gallery
down there.

1052
01:38:05,797 --> 01:38:07,547
Sixty rounds left on "B."

1053
01:38:07,632 --> 01:38:10,801
Forty. Twenty. Ten.

1054
01:38:10,885 --> 01:38:13,136
"B" gun's dry.
Twenty on "A."

1055
01:38:14,388 --> 01:38:17,599
Ten. Five.

1056
01:38:20,478 --> 01:38:22,145
That's it.

1057
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:25,482
Jesus, they were
wall-to-wall in there.

1058
01:38:29,445 --> 01:38:31,446
They're at the pressure door.

1059
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:34,991
Man, listen to that.

1060
01:38:35,076 --> 01:38:38,745
Bishop here. I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

1061
01:38:38,830 --> 01:38:39,710
Well, that's a switch.

1062
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:45,710
It's very pretty, Bishop,
but what are we looking for?

1063
01:38:45,795 --> 01:38:49,339
That's it.
Emergency venting.

1064
01:38:49,423 --> 01:38:54,052
Oh, that's beautiful, man. Oh,
man, that-that just beats it all.

1065
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:57,013
How long till it blows?
Four hours.

1066
01:38:57,139 --> 01:39:00,183
With a blast radius
of 30 kilometers,

1067
01:39:00,268 --> 01:39:03,895
equal to about 40 megatons.

1068
01:39:04,021 --> 01:39:07,482
We got problems. I don't believe this.
I don't fucking believe this.

1069
01:39:07,567 --> 01:39:10,068
Vasquez, close the shutters.

1070
01:39:10,152 --> 01:39:12,320
Why can't we shut it
down from here?

1071
01:39:12,405 --> 01:39:14,322
I'm sorry. The crash
caused too much damage.

1072
01:39:14,407 --> 01:39:16,950
An overload is inevitable
at this point.

1073
01:39:17,034 --> 01:39:19,953
Oh, man, and I was
getting short.

1074
01:39:20,037 --> 01:39:23,373
Four more weeks and out. Now
l'm gonna buy it on this rock.

1075
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:25,542
It ain't half fair, man.
Hudson, give us a break!

1076
01:39:25,626 --> 01:39:28,211
Four more weeks. Oh, man.

1077
01:39:28,296 --> 01:39:31,506
We've got to get the other
drop ship from the Sulaco.

1078
01:39:31,591 --> 01:39:34,551
I mean, there must be some way
of bringing it down on remote.

1079
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:38,138
How? The transmitter was on the A.P.C.
It's wasted.

1080
01:39:38,264 --> 01:39:41,474
I don't care how, but we'd better think of something.
We'd better think of a way.

1081
01:39:41,601 --> 01:39:44,436
Think of what? We're fucked!
We're doomed! Shut up!

1082
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:47,314
Shut up! What about
the colony transmitters?

1083
01:39:47,398 --> 01:39:50,191
The uplink tower down at the other end.
Why can't we use that?

1084
01:39:50,276 --> 01:39:53,236
No, I checked. The hardware in
between here and there was damaged.

1085
01:39:53,321 --> 01:39:55,238
We can't align the dish.

1086
01:39:55,323 --> 01:39:57,741
Well, somebody's gonna
have to go out there,

1087
01:39:57,825 --> 01:40:00,744
take a portable terminal, go out
there and patch in manually.

1088
01:40:00,828 --> 01:40:05,874
Oh, yeah, sure. With those things running around?
You can count me out.

1089
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,001
Guess we can just count you
out of everything. I'll go.

1090
01:40:08,085 --> 01:40:09,878
That's right, man.
Why don't you go, man?

1091
01:40:10,004 --> 01:40:11,838
I'll go.
What?

1092
01:40:11,923 --> 01:40:16,259
I'll go. I mean, I'm the only one qualified
to remote pilot the ship anyway.

1093
01:40:16,344 --> 01:40:20,722
Yeah, right, man. Bishop should go.
Good idea.

1094
01:40:20,806 --> 01:40:22,974
Believe me, I'd prefer not to.

1095
01:40:23,059 --> 01:40:25,977
I may be synthetic,
but I'm not stupid.

1096
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:39,658
How long?

1097
01:40:39,742 --> 01:40:42,994
This conduit runs almost to the
uplink assembly-1 80 meters.

1098
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:46,414
Say 40 minutes to crawl
down there-Right.

1099
01:40:46,499 --> 01:40:50,251
An hour to patch in
and align the antenna.

1100
01:40:51,337 --> 01:40:53,588
Thirty minutes
to prep the ship,

1101
01:40:53,714 --> 01:40:56,925
and about 50 minutes flight time.
It's gonna be close.

1102
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:04,140
Good luck.
See you soon.

1103
01:41:05,601 --> 01:41:09,396
Watch your fingers.

1104
01:41:10,398 --> 01:41:11,773
Vaya con Dios, man.

1105
01:41:25,579 --> 01:41:30,166
This is unbelievable.
Twenty meters and closing.

1106
01:41:30,292 --> 01:41:32,377
Fifteen.
How many?

1107
01:41:32,461 --> 01:41:35,046
Can't tell. Lots.

1108
01:41:36,632 --> 01:41:39,884
"D" gun's down 50%..

1109
01:41:41,929 --> 01:41:45,056
"C" gun's right behind it.

1110
01:41:47,018 --> 01:41:50,186
Stopping them.
It ain't stopping them.

1111
01:41:50,271 --> 01:41:55,275
- 150 rounds on "D."
Come on. Come on, baby.

1112
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:57,652
Hundred rounds.

1113
01:41:57,737 --> 01:42:00,405
Come on! Come on!

1114
01:42:05,411 --> 01:42:06,911
"D" gun's down to 20.

1115
01:42:08,164 --> 01:42:10,582
Ten.

1116
01:42:11,834 --> 01:42:13,251
Damn it!

1117
01:42:14,879 --> 01:42:17,881
Wait! They're retreating.

1118
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:25,847
The guns stopped them.

1119
01:42:27,725 --> 01:42:29,684
You're right.

1120
01:42:37,068 --> 01:42:38,985
Next time they walk
right up and knock.

1121
01:42:39,070 --> 01:42:41,029
Yeah, but they don't know that.

1122
01:42:41,113 --> 01:42:43,865
They're probably looking
for other ways to get in.

1123
01:42:44,909 --> 01:42:46,785
That'll take 'em a while.

1124
01:42:46,911 --> 01:42:49,412
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
Shut up!

1125
01:42:50,748 --> 01:42:53,208
I want you two
walking perimeter.

1126
01:42:54,794 --> 01:42:57,378
Move!

1127
01:43:03,594 --> 01:43:05,804
Hey, listen.

1128
01:43:05,888 --> 01:43:08,807
We're all
in strung-out shape,

1129
01:43:08,891 --> 01:43:12,185
but stay frosty and alert.

1130
01:43:13,604 --> 01:43:16,481
We can't afford to let
one of those bastards in here.

1131
01:43:16,565 --> 01:43:18,733
All right.
Vámonos.

1132
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:31,621
How long's it been
since you got any sleep?

1133
01:43:31,705 --> 01:43:35,333
Twenty-four hours?

1134
01:43:35,417 --> 01:43:38,711
Hicks, I'm not gonna end
up like those others.

1135
01:43:38,796 --> 01:43:41,631
You'll take care
of it, won't you?

1136
01:43:43,217 --> 01:43:47,762
If it comes to that,
I'll do us both.

1137
01:43:49,473 --> 01:43:52,183
Listen, let's just make sure
it doesn't come to that.

1138
01:43:52,309 --> 01:43:55,895
All right?
All right.

1139
01:43:55,980 --> 01:44:01,192
Hey, I want to introduce you
to a personal friend of mine.

1140
01:44:01,277 --> 01:44:05,196
This is an M-41A
pulse rifle, 10 millimeter,

1141
01:44:05,281 --> 01:44:09,117
with an over-and-under 30 millimeter
pump-action grenade launcher.

1142
01:44:09,201 --> 01:44:11,160
Feel the weight.

1143
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:20,378
Okay, what do I do?

1144
01:44:25,801 --> 01:44:28,428
Okay, pull it in tight here.
Right.

1145
01:44:28,554 --> 01:44:30,847
Uh-huh. Lean into it. Mm-hmm.

1146
01:44:30,931 --> 01:44:33,600
All right.
Now, it will kick some.

1147
01:44:33,684 --> 01:44:37,228
All right. When the counter
reads zero here, you-

1148
01:44:37,354 --> 01:44:39,606
I press this up?
That's right.

1149
01:44:41,692 --> 01:44:44,819
Get another one in quick.
Slap it in hard.

1150
01:44:44,945 --> 01:44:47,947
Right. And you're ready
to rock and roll.

1151
01:44:48,073 --> 01:44:50,867
What's this? That's
the grenade launcher.

1152
01:44:50,951 --> 01:44:53,703
I don't think you
want to mess with that.

1153
01:44:53,787 --> 01:44:57,790
You started this.
Show me everything.

1154
01:44:57,875 --> 01:44:59,834
I can handle myself.

1155
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:03,379
Yeah, I noticed.

1156
01:45:13,515 --> 01:45:15,475
How do you feel?

1157
01:45:15,559 --> 01:45:19,062
All right, I guess.
One hell of a hangover.

1158
01:45:20,606 --> 01:45:22,815
Look, Ripley, I just
want-Forget it.

1159
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:24,859
Excuse me.

1160
01:46:19,873 --> 01:46:24,627
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
It's okay. It's okay.

1161
01:47:35,365 --> 01:47:38,785
Newt, wake up.

1162
01:47:38,869 --> 01:47:40,787
Wha-
Be quiet.

1163
01:47:40,871 --> 01:47:42,872
We're in trouble.

1164
01:48:00,390 --> 01:48:02,183
No!

1165
01:48:02,267 --> 01:48:04,936
Move, Newt!

1166
01:48:25,415 --> 01:48:27,333
Hey!

1167
01:48:36,343 --> 01:48:40,680
Help! Help!

1168
01:48:40,764 --> 01:48:42,723
Hicks!
Somebody!

1169
01:48:42,808 --> 01:48:44,725
Say again, Bishop.

1170
01:48:44,810 --> 01:48:48,146
You've got it into auto-refuel
mode, and it's sequencing right?

1171
01:48:48,272 --> 01:48:51,274
That's right.
Okay, good. Stay on it.

1172
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:54,944
Get back to me when you've
activated the launch cycle.

1173
01:48:55,028 --> 01:48:58,281
Roger.
He's at the uplink tower.

1174
01:48:58,407 --> 01:49:00,908
Good.
Terrific.

1175
01:49:02,619 --> 01:49:05,621
- Hicks! Hicks! Hicks!
- Help!

1176
01:49:05,706 --> 01:49:08,291
- Help! Help!
- Hicks, help us!

1177
01:49:08,375 --> 01:49:12,461
- Break the glass! Break it. Break it.
- Yes.

1178
01:49:12,546 --> 01:49:14,547
I'll try.

1179
01:49:34,818 --> 01:49:37,278
Ripley, I'm scared.

1180
01:49:37,362 --> 01:49:39,363
Me too.

1181
01:49:44,828 --> 01:49:46,829
Stay here.

1182
01:49:58,634 --> 01:50:01,677
It's the medlab. Hudson!

1183
01:50:01,762 --> 01:50:05,097
Vasquez, meet me in medlab.
We got a fire.

1184
01:50:05,182 --> 01:50:07,183
We're on our way.

1185
01:50:10,062 --> 01:50:12,063
They're coming, Newt.

1186
01:50:44,638 --> 01:50:46,722
Shoot it out!

1187
01:50:50,727 --> 01:50:52,603
- Hudson!
- Jesus.

1188
01:50:56,191 --> 01:50:58,526
Christ, kid, look out!

1189
01:51:06,451 --> 01:51:07,451
Fucking die.

1190
01:51:19,339 --> 01:51:22,550
Over there! Ready?
Yeah! Yeah!

1191
01:51:22,634 --> 01:51:24,260
Now!

1192
01:51:27,764 --> 01:51:29,640
Hudson?
Yeah. All clear.

1193
01:51:29,766 --> 01:51:32,310
Nailed the other one.
Lt's history, man.

1194
01:51:33,729 --> 01:51:35,646
Jesus.

1195
01:51:36,815 --> 01:51:40,401
Burke-
It was Burke.

1196
01:51:42,654 --> 01:51:45,865
I say we grease this rat-fuck
son of a bitch right now.

1197
01:51:45,949 --> 01:51:48,868
Just doesn't make
any goddamn sense.

1198
01:51:51,830 --> 01:51:55,875
He figured that he could get an
alien back through quarantine...

1199
01:51:55,959 --> 01:51:58,669
if one of us
was impregnated-

1200
01:51:59,963 --> 01:52:02,173
whatever you call it-

1201
01:52:02,257 --> 01:52:04,842
and then frozen
for the trip home.

1202
01:52:04,926 --> 01:52:08,971
Nobody would know about the
embryos we were carrying-

1203
01:52:09,056 --> 01:52:11,098
me and Newt.

1204
01:52:12,934 --> 01:52:14,894
Wait a minute, now.
We'd all know.

1205
01:52:14,978 --> 01:52:17,229
Yes. The only way
he could do it...

1206
01:52:17,314 --> 01:52:21,067
is if he sabotaged certain
freezers on the way home.

1207
01:52:21,151 --> 01:52:23,736
Namely yours.

1208
01:52:23,820 --> 01:52:27,698
Then he could jettison the bodies
and make up any story he liked.

1209
01:52:27,783 --> 01:52:33,162
Fuck! He's dead.
You're dog meat, pal.

1210
01:52:34,164 --> 01:52:36,082
This is so nuts.

1211
01:52:36,166 --> 01:52:38,793
I mean, listen-
Listen to what you're saying.

1212
01:52:38,877 --> 01:52:41,545
It's paranoid delusion.

1213
01:52:41,630 --> 01:52:45,966
It's really sad.
It's pathetic.

1214
01:52:46,051 --> 01:52:49,845
You know, Burke, I don't know
which species is worse.

1215
01:52:49,930 --> 01:52:53,224
You don't see them fucking each other
over for a goddamn percentage.

1216
01:52:53,308 --> 01:52:56,435
All right.
We waste him. No offense.

1217
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:58,187
No! He's gotta go back-

1218
01:53:00,357 --> 01:53:02,983
They cut the power. What do
you mean, they cut the power?

1219
01:53:03,068 --> 01:53:04,652
How could they cut the power, man?
They're animals.

1220
01:53:04,736 --> 01:53:07,321
I want you two with trackers,
checking the corridors! Move!

1221
01:53:07,406 --> 01:53:09,323
Gorman, watch Burke!
I got him.

1222
01:53:09,408 --> 01:53:11,700
Newt, stay close.

1223
01:53:15,205 --> 01:53:18,290
I'll go this side.
You do that, man.

1224
01:53:42,023 --> 01:53:44,817
- Anything?
- There's something.

1225
01:53:44,901 --> 01:53:48,112
It's inside the complex.

1226
01:53:48,196 --> 01:53:50,197
You're just reading me.

1227
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:53,075
No, no, it ain't you.

1228
01:53:55,245 --> 01:53:58,914
They're inside-inside the perimeter.
They're in here.

1229
01:53:58,999 --> 01:54:02,460
Hudson, stay cool!
Vasquez?

1230
01:54:09,217 --> 01:54:10,801
Hudson may be right.

1231
01:54:10,927 --> 01:54:14,054
- Get back, both of you!
- The signal's weird.

1232
01:54:15,432 --> 01:54:18,100
Must be some interference
or something.

1233
01:54:18,185 --> 01:54:20,102
There's movement
all over the place!

1234
01:54:20,187 --> 01:54:23,522
Get back to Operations.
It's game time.

1235
01:54:23,607 --> 01:54:25,983
Newt.

1236
01:54:27,527 --> 01:54:30,404
Seal the door.
Hurry!

1237
01:54:30,489 --> 01:54:33,949
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Get back!

1238
01:54:34,034 --> 01:54:35,951
Work fast.

1239
01:54:39,331 --> 01:54:42,500
Cover your eyes, Newt.
Don't look at the light.

1240
01:54:42,584 --> 01:54:45,586
Movement. Signal's clean.

1241
01:54:45,670 --> 01:54:47,588
Range, 20 meters.

1242
01:54:47,672 --> 01:54:49,840
They found a way in,
something we missed.

1243
01:54:49,925 --> 01:54:51,842
We didn't miss anything.

1244
01:54:51,927 --> 01:54:55,721
Eighteen.
Seventeen meters.

1245
01:54:55,805 --> 01:54:58,182
Something under the floor, not in the plans.
I don't know.

1246
01:54:58,266 --> 01:55:00,351
- Fifteen meters.
- Ripley!

1247
01:55:00,435 --> 01:55:03,938
- Definitely inside the barricades.
- Let's go.

1248
01:55:05,565 --> 01:55:07,441
Thirteen meters. That's
right outside the door.

1249
01:55:07,567 --> 01:55:10,194
Hicks, Vasquez, get back!
This is a big fucking signal.

1250
01:55:10,278 --> 01:55:13,489
- How you doing, Vasquez? Talk to me.
- Almost there.

1251
01:55:15,116 --> 01:55:17,493
That's it.

1252
01:55:17,577 --> 01:55:21,872
Twelve meters. Eleven.

1253
01:55:21,957 --> 01:55:24,458
- Ten.
- Then they're right on us.

1254
01:55:24,543 --> 01:55:27,795
- Nine meters.
- Remember-short, controlled bursts.

1255
01:55:27,879 --> 01:55:29,213
Eight meters.

1256
01:55:32,217 --> 01:55:34,885
Seven.

1257
01:55:34,970 --> 01:55:37,888
- Six.
- It can't be. That's inside the room.

1258
01:55:37,973 --> 01:55:41,016
- It's reading right, man. Look!
- Well, you're not reading it right.

1259
01:55:43,603 --> 01:55:48,190
Five meters, man.
Four. What the hell?

1260
01:55:50,860 --> 01:55:54,446
Oh, my God. Oh, sh-
Give me the light.

1261
01:56:13,049 --> 01:56:15,467
There they go!
Over there! Get them!

1262
01:56:15,552 --> 01:56:20,264
Come on! Get them!

1263
01:56:20,348 --> 01:56:23,684
Do something, Gorman!

1264
01:56:23,768 --> 01:56:27,479
Get them! Look out! There's more of them!
There's more of them!

1265
01:56:27,564 --> 01:56:31,692
Medical! Get to Medical!
Do it! Now!

1266
01:56:31,776 --> 01:56:35,863
Hudson, look out!
Look out!

1267
01:56:35,947 --> 01:56:36,447
Now!

1268
01:56:42,329 --> 01:56:44,496
Burke!

1269
01:56:44,581 --> 01:56:47,458
Open this door!

1270
01:56:47,542 --> 01:56:50,336
Burke! Open it!

1271
01:56:52,422 --> 01:56:54,131
Go! Fall back!

1272
01:56:57,302 --> 01:56:59,511
Go!

1273
01:56:59,596 --> 01:57:02,431
- Die, motherfucker!
- Burke!

1274
01:57:02,515 --> 01:57:06,101
Hudson! Hudson!

1275
01:57:06,186 --> 01:57:11,190
Motherfucker! Come on! Come on!
Come and get it, baby! Come on!

1276
01:57:11,274 --> 01:57:14,902
I don't got all day! Come on! Come on!
Come on, you bastard!

1277
01:57:15,028 --> 01:57:17,780
- Come on! You too!
- Oh, you want some of this?

1278
01:57:17,864 --> 01:57:20,157
Fuck you!

1279
01:57:21,117 --> 01:57:23,869
Fuck you! Hicks!

1280
01:57:23,953 --> 01:57:26,580
Hudson!

1281
01:57:34,714 --> 01:57:37,174
Come on.
Let's go!

1282
01:57:37,717 --> 01:57:40,010
It's locked!

1283
01:57:57,278 --> 01:58:00,989
- Got it! Let's go! Let's go!
- Go! Go!

1284
01:58:03,618 --> 01:58:06,495
- Move, Gorman!
- Seal it!

1285
01:58:07,539 --> 01:58:11,834
Burke! Goddamn you!
Open this door!

1286
01:58:20,844 --> 01:58:24,430
Get back!

1287
01:58:24,514 --> 01:58:26,765
- Hurry up.
- Gorman, get out of the way!

1288
01:58:26,891 --> 01:58:29,893
Ripley, this way!
What-

1289
01:58:29,978 --> 01:58:31,854
Wait. Get behind me.

1290
01:58:31,938 --> 01:58:36,024
Whatever you're gonna do,
do it fast!

1291
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:40,195
Hicks! Go! Come on. Let's go.

1292
01:58:41,865 --> 01:58:43,365
Move!

1293
01:58:50,331 --> 01:58:53,834
Which way is it to the landing
field from here? This way.

1294
01:58:58,423 --> 01:59:01,258
Go right.

1295
01:59:03,511 --> 01:59:05,471
This way. This way.

1296
01:59:14,105 --> 01:59:17,566
- Which way?
- Straight ahead and left.

1297
01:59:17,650 --> 01:59:21,236
Bishop, do you read me?
Come in. Over.

1298
01:59:21,321 --> 01:59:23,197
The ship is on its way.

1299
01:59:23,281 --> 01:59:26,366
E.T.A., 16 minutes.

1300
01:59:26,451 --> 01:59:29,244
Stand by there.
We're on our way.

1301
01:59:40,507 --> 01:59:42,466
- Which way now?
- That way.

1302
01:59:42,550 --> 01:59:45,594
No, wait. This way.
You sure?

1303
01:59:47,180 --> 01:59:50,057
Vasquez, move!

1304
01:59:52,644 --> 01:59:54,812
Right up here. It's just up here.
Hicks!

1305
01:59:54,896 --> 01:59:57,773
We're almost there.

1306
01:59:57,857 --> 02:00:01,109
Newt, wait! Newt!

1307
02:00:25,134 --> 02:00:27,094
Vasquez!

1308
02:00:27,178 --> 02:00:29,471
Go!

1309
02:00:31,641 --> 02:00:34,142
Oh, no!

1310
02:00:45,405 --> 02:00:47,739
Newt.

1311
02:00:47,824 --> 02:00:51,159
Up there. There's a shortcut
across the roof.

1312
02:00:51,244 --> 02:00:53,328
Hicks.

1313
02:01:02,755 --> 02:01:04,882
You always were
an asshole, Gorman.

1314
02:01:23,276 --> 02:01:25,485
Newt! God!
Ripley!

1315
02:01:25,570 --> 02:01:27,821
Newt!

1316
02:01:27,906 --> 02:01:31,033
Hicks! Hicks, get her!
Hurry!

1317
02:01:35,496 --> 02:01:37,956
- Hold on, Newt!
- I'm slipping!

1318
02:01:38,041 --> 02:01:40,250
- Don't let go.
- Ripley!

1319
02:01:40,335 --> 02:01:43,378
- Hold on. Gotcha!
- Help!

1320
02:01:44,380 --> 02:01:46,840
I gotcha.

1321
02:01:46,925 --> 02:01:49,801
Newt!

1322
02:01:49,928 --> 02:01:51,762
No!

1323
02:01:55,141 --> 02:01:57,976
Come on.
We can find her with this.

1324
02:01:58,061 --> 02:02:01,772
- Stay where you are, Newt.
- Ripley!

1325
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:04,942
We're coming.

1326
02:02:14,160 --> 02:02:16,161
Ripley!

1327
02:02:18,623 --> 02:02:22,334
This way.

1328
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:27,255
She's close.
Newt!

1329
02:02:29,926 --> 02:02:31,843
Ripley!

1330
02:02:31,928 --> 02:02:34,388
Where are you?
Can you hear me?

1331
02:02:35,765 --> 02:02:37,683
Newt!
Here!

1332
02:02:37,767 --> 02:02:39,977
I'm here!
Where?

1333
02:02:44,023 --> 02:02:47,067
Newt, are you okay?

1334
02:02:47,151 --> 02:02:49,945
We'll have to cut it.

1335
02:02:50,029 --> 02:02:53,448
Climb down, honey.
We've gotta cut through.

1336
02:03:00,665 --> 02:03:02,582
Newt?

1337
02:03:02,667 --> 02:03:05,961
Now, don't move.
Stay very still.

1338
02:03:06,045 --> 02:03:08,046
Okay.

1339
02:03:08,131 --> 02:03:10,799
We're almost there.
Hang in there, okay?

1340
02:03:17,974 --> 02:03:19,725
Hicks. Hurry.
I know.

1341
02:03:19,851 --> 02:03:22,310
I know!
I mean it!

1342
02:03:35,950 --> 02:03:38,869
Newt? Newt,
just stay still.

1343
02:03:42,081 --> 02:03:44,291
Almost there.

1344
02:03:44,375 --> 02:03:46,043
No!

1345
02:03:47,503 --> 02:03:49,588
Newt!

1346
02:03:59,390 --> 02:04:02,893
No! No!

1347
02:04:03,019 --> 02:04:05,145
No! No! No!
Let's go.

1348
02:04:05,229 --> 02:04:07,439
No! No!
They don't kill you!

1349
02:04:07,523 --> 02:04:09,649
They-They don't kill you!
They-

1350
02:04:09,734 --> 02:04:11,610
She's alive!
She's alive!

1351
02:04:11,694 --> 02:04:14,112
All right. I believe you.
She's alive.

1352
02:04:14,197 --> 02:04:16,865
We've got to go. Now!

1353
02:04:31,756 --> 02:04:33,715
Go!

1354
02:04:47,271 --> 02:04:51,775
Get it off!
Hicks.

1355
02:04:51,859 --> 02:04:54,152
Get it off!

1356
02:05:00,409 --> 02:05:04,246
Here.

1357
02:05:08,501 --> 02:05:10,585
Go.

1358
02:05:12,964 --> 02:05:15,173
Come on.
You can make it.

1359
02:05:38,447 --> 02:05:41,700
Bishop, how much time?

1360
02:05:41,784 --> 02:05:43,577
Plenty.
Twenty-six minutes.

1361
02:05:43,703 --> 02:05:47,080
We're not leaving.
We're not?

1362
02:07:11,415 --> 02:07:15,794
Ripley-I don't wanna hear about it, Bishop.
She's alive. There's still time.

1363
02:07:15,878 --> 02:07:19,005
In 19 minutes, this area is gonna be a
cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.

1364
02:07:19,131 --> 02:07:21,925
Hicks, don't let him leave.
We ain't going anywhere.

1365
02:07:24,387 --> 02:07:27,430
See you, Hicks.
Dwayne.

1366
02:07:27,515 --> 02:07:30,308
It's Dwayne.

1367
02:07:32,061 --> 02:07:33,979
Ellen.

1368
02:07:34,063 --> 02:07:37,732
Don't be gone long, Ellen.

1369
02:07:44,824 --> 02:07:47,909
Attention. Emergency.

1370
02:07:47,994 --> 02:07:52,038
All personnel
must evacuate immediately.

1371
02:07:52,123 --> 02:07:54,958
You now have 15 minutes...

1372
02:07:55,042 --> 02:07:57,335
to reach minimum safe distance.

1373
02:08:43,632 --> 02:08:47,093
Attention. Emergency.

1374
02:08:47,178 --> 02:08:51,389
All personnel
must evacuate immediately.

1375
02:08:51,474 --> 02:08:54,225
You now have 14 minutes...

1376
02:08:54,310 --> 02:08:56,978
to reach minimum safe distance.

1377
02:11:47,525 --> 02:11:48,025
Oh.

1378
02:12:37,449 --> 02:12:41,119
- Ripley! Ripley!
- Newt.

1379
02:12:55,050 --> 02:12:59,304
Grab on to me!
Hold on!

1380
02:16:50,285 --> 02:16:52,286
Let's go!

1381
02:16:55,249 --> 02:16:57,708
Behind us!

1382
02:17:48,510 --> 02:17:51,345
Attention. Emergency.

1383
02:17:51,430 --> 02:17:54,599
All personnel
must evacuate immediately.

1384
02:17:56,226 --> 02:17:59,353
Attention. Emergency.

1385
02:17:59,438 --> 02:18:03,941
All personnel
must evacuate immediately.

1386
02:18:04,026 --> 02:18:06,485
You now have four minutes...

1387
02:18:06,570 --> 02:18:09,030
to reach minimum safe distance.

1388
02:18:25,005 --> 02:18:28,799
Come on, goddamn it!

1389
02:18:31,762 --> 02:18:34,555
Hold on to me!

1390
02:19:23,814 --> 02:19:26,607
Attention. Emergency.

1391
02:19:26,692 --> 02:19:30,611
All personnel
must evacuate immediately.

1392
02:19:30,696 --> 02:19:33,364
You now have two minutes...

1393
02:19:33,448 --> 02:19:37,451
to reach minimum safe distance.

1394
02:19:43,166 --> 02:19:45,167
No.

1395
02:19:48,463 --> 02:19:51,340
Bishop, goddamn you!

1396
02:20:55,155 --> 02:20:57,239
Close your eyes, baby.

1397
02:20:59,785 --> 02:21:01,786
Look!

1398
02:21:08,668 --> 02:21:10,669
Come on! Come on!

1399
02:21:39,157 --> 02:21:41,742
Punch it, Bishop!

1400
02:22:26,955 --> 02:22:29,039
It's okay.
We're okay.

1401
02:22:38,758 --> 02:22:40,718
Hey.

1402
02:22:42,137 --> 02:22:44,638
We made it.

1403
02:22:44,723 --> 02:22:46,724
I knew you'd come.

1404
02:23:01,656 --> 02:23:03,824
He's gonna be all right.
He's just out.

1405
02:23:03,909 --> 02:23:06,285
I had to give him another shot
for the pain.

1406
02:23:07,495 --> 02:23:10,080
We need a stretcher
to carry him up to Medical.

1407
02:23:10,165 --> 02:23:12,166
Okay.

1408
02:23:17,839 --> 02:23:21,842
I'm sorry if I scared you. That
platform wasjust becoming too unstable.

1409
02:23:21,927 --> 02:23:24,720
I had to circle and hope that things
didn't get too rough to take you off.

1410
02:23:24,804 --> 02:23:28,766
Bishop, you did okay.

1411
02:23:28,850 --> 02:23:31,560
- I did?
- Oh, yeah.

1412
02:24:11,017 --> 02:24:13,227
Go! Move!

1413
02:24:15,647 --> 02:24:18,816
No! Here! Here!

1414
02:24:18,900 --> 02:24:20,901
Run!

1415
02:24:26,199 --> 02:24:27,783
Here!

1416
02:25:56,539 --> 02:25:58,749
Get away from her, you bitch!

1417
02:26:19,896 --> 02:26:24,441
Come on! Come on!

1418
02:27:52,906 --> 02:27:55,365
Ripley!

1419
02:29:06,771 --> 02:29:09,231
Bishop!

1420
02:29:55,778 --> 02:29:58,739
Mommy.
Oh, God!

1421
02:30:01,659 --> 02:30:04,828
Not bad for a h-human.

1422
02:30:51,959 --> 02:30:54,920
Are we gonna sleep
all the way home?

1423
02:30:55,046 --> 02:30:58,048
All the way home.
Can I dream?

1424
02:31:00,343 --> 02:31:02,969
Yes, honey.
I think we both can.

1425
02:31:11,187 --> 02:31:14,314
Sleep tight.
Affirmative.
