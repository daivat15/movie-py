1
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,125
Hey, it's Marsh.

2
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,845
Okay.

3
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,802
When are you just gonna
give up on that thing

4
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,881
and get a new one?

5
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,610
Well, you know me.

6
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,002
Love a lost cause.

7
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,090
Where are you off to?

8
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,450
New start down at Tonto National Forest.

9
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,763
Ate up 40,000 acres yesterday.

10
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,569
Fixing to triple that today.

11
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,085
You got something to say to me
before you walk out that door?

12
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,921
I guess I said some shit
last night I shouldn't have.

13
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,923
Yeah. You did.

14
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,360
Why?

15
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,006
Because.

16
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,491
Because what?

17
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,165
'Cause you're smarter than I am,
especially when we squabble.

18
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,642
And it pisses me off.

19
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,168
Well, I can appreciate that.

20
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,684
I bet you can.

21
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,887
I guess we both made
some mistakes last night.

22
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,200
Yes, we did.

23
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,482
Let's make better ones next time.

24
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,366
Okay.

25
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,681
God, I love you, Manda-bear.

26
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,963
I love you, too, Shortstop.

27
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,090
-See ya.
-See ya.

28
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,322
Bla-blow wants to go with you.

29
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,845
What did you say to me?

30
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,241
Bla-blow wants to go with you.

31
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,609
Bla-blow wants to go with me?

32
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,330
Crazy little guy. Come here.

33
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,241
Can you take this little stinker?

34
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,004
-Yeah.
-He's not a stinker.

35
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,003
-No, you're a stinker.
-No, I'm not.

36
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,365
She's a stinker.

37
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,805
<i>Eve. Say bye.</i>

38
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,689
- Bla-blow says good bye.
- Bye-bye.

39
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,446
Put me down. Put me down.

40
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,806
Oh, boy.

41
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,291
Go, Mack! Come on, buddy.

42
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,010
Get that can, would you?

43
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,164
Just 'cause you got a crack in your ass

44
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,368
don't make you a cripple, Jesse.
You get it.

<i>Crew 7, can we get
a ground fix on the fire?</i>

47

Bravo Squad, take five!

Powwow?

56
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,646
Breaky.

57
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,651
Yo!

-Yeah.

-Hot sauce.
-You look like a bag

65
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,404
of smashed assholes right now.
You all right?

66
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,683
I had a crazy night, bro.

67
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,965
I finally hooked up
with that gal Cheyanne.

68
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,127
-Yes!
-Cheyanne?

69
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,890
The Cheyanne? The girl from the Emporium

70
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,446
with the tattoos and the beautiful eyes?

71
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,090
-That's the one.
-Outstanding.

72
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,924
What's up? Dude, Whitted,

73
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,849
Mack closed that girl
from the Emporium last night.

74
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,046
-Cheyanne?
-Yeah.

75
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,208
I see her at church now and again.
She doesn't talk.

76
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,486
Yeah, she doesn't need to though, right?

77
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,766
-I mean, like, unreal.
-Hey, guys.

78
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,320
Guys, guys!
The man is clearly an artist.

79
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,767
Let him share his gift.
MacKenzie, proceed.

80
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,486
I mean, she went
full-blown medieval on me.

81
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,971
I had to buckle in at one point.

82
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,644
-Oh, God.
-I want to buckle in.

83
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,006
I mean, there was just one thing

84
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,809
that she said that
just threw me, though.

85
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,689
-Don't worry about it.
-What? Dude, you can't say

86
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,205
there's something and then,
"Don't worry about it."

87
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,566
-What was it?
-All right, all right, all right.

88
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,325
Postcoital, we're laying in bed.
I grab the remote.

89
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,289
Okay? I turn the TV on.
I'm flipping through the channel.

90
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,771
I end up on an infomercial.

91
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,043
In the background

92
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,450
there's Mount Rushmore.

93
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,329
And I'm trying to make
conversation at this point.

94
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,765
- It's awkward.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

95
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,321
-And I'm like, "Wow, that's amazing."
-Right.

96
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,129
Her rebuttal to this?

97
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,082
"Especially when you realize
it's a natural thing."

98
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,441
-What? What?
-That's not good.

99
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,965
-What?
-You mean to tell me

100
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,805
that this girl believes
that the faces of our four presidents

101
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,929
showed up on a mountain
through the process of

102
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,843
-natura| erosion?
-Yeah!

103
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,888
Wind and rain carved out the presidents.

104
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,241
-Many forms of intelligence, Mack.
-I love wind and rain!

105
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,049
-Oh, my God.
-Hey, honestly, Mack,

106
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,525
this girl is perfect for you, man.

107
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,726
She's like a match made in heaven.

108
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,643
- I'm proud of you.
- I haven't slept.

109
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,846
<i>Whitted, where you at?</i>

110
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,440
We got a chain left
to finish the mop-up.

111
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,090
All right, just get it done.

112
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,525
<i>Aye, aye,</i> Papa-

113
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,568

-Yeah, Supe!

115
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,243

127
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,131
From Hatch.

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,443
"Saw Natalie working Murph's last night.

"Did you know she was pregnant?"

130
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,802
Who's Natalie?

131
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,809
Some chick I rolled with

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,281
Yeah.

What's up, Supe?

138
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,086
The fire's gonna do a 180 off the line.

139
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,762
Division Charlie, it's Crew 7.

140
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,769
Go ahead, Crew <i>7.</i>

141
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,081
Yeah, I think the fire's gonna go toward

142
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,844
homes to the southwest.

143
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,524
What we'd like to do
is take my crew down

144
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,080
to the eastern edge of
the creek and prep for a burn.

145
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,289
<i>Negative. We've got an inbound
hotshot crew to your division.</i>

<i>They'll make the call.</i>

Copy that.

148
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,965
God damn it.

149
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,801
How y'all doin‘?

150
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,245
Eric Marsh, Crew 7.

151
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,243
My captain, Jesse Steed.

152
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,607
Well, this fire's gonna shift down here.

153
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,603
I figured you and your crew
should go down

154
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,806
and prep that creek for a burn.

155
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,402
I don't mean any disrespect
to you California boys,

156
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,563
but I was... Just been watching
this line for a few days now.

157
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,051
The fire's gonna shift,

158
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,208
probably jump over to that
neighborhood right over there.

159
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,362
Okay, let me stop you right
there, okay? Marsh, is it?

160
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,761
-Yeah, it's Marsh.
-Yeah, well...

161
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,004
You guys are Type 2,
and we are hotshots.

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,521
So, why don't you do
what deucers do best,

163
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,843
which is stay in the back
and mop up our shit?

164
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,370
Ladies.

165
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,047
<i>Maricopa County Sheriff's Office!</i>

166
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,361
<i>This is a mandatory evacuation!</i>

167
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,091
Get in, Trevor!

168
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,965
-Hey, Supe.
-Yeah.

169
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,769
You're not gonna like this one.

170
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,769
Smith and Landow are cutting bait on us.

171
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,729
What? God.

172
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,728
A few slots opened up
on the Blue River Hotshots,

173
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,768
and Ferguson's rolling out
the red carpet.

174
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,571
Well, Blue River's a good crew.
Ferguson's a solid supe.

175
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,802
They'll probably make double
what we gave 'em.

176
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,962
We could've saved
all these people's homes

177
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,724
if we ran the play that you called.

178
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,565
The boys are pissed.

179
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,926
So am I.

180
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,768
-Hey, Sturgill.
-Amanda.

181
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,122
-Where'd you find this one?
-Tweaker lab outside of town.

182
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,807
-You arrest the guys that did it?
-Didn't need to.

183
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,087
Dipshits blew themselves up
mixing a batch.

184
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,241
Good.

185
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,725
Attaboy.

186
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,930
There you go.

187
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,608
We were gonna put him down,
but then Steinbrink said

188
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,683
we should call you.

189
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,004
So, what do you think?

190
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,009
You're safe now.

191
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,964
I promise.

192
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,649
You're all right.

193
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,610
Lie down.

194
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,130
Good boy. Lie down. Come on. Lie down.

195
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,084
Who's this?

196
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,405
New friend.

197
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,207
Your friend got a name?

198
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,121
-Roscoe.
-Roscoe.

199
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,085
You're dirty.

200
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,130
You're filthy.

201
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,688
-You smell.
-So do you.

202
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,042
I've been thinking about inviting over
some ranchers from the area,

203
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,920
showing them the benefits of
having the horses go barefoot.

204
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,447
Maybe I can drum up some new clients.

205
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,082
I'm pregnant with triplets.

206
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,682
Willie Nelson is the father.

207
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,404
I like Willie Nelson.

208
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,644
Well, that's good.

209
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,571
I'm sorry.

210
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,564
It's just some shit
happened out on the line.

211
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,483
Yeah. Shit always happens on the line.

212
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,329
You want to talk about it?

213
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,290
Or you want to do your John Wayne thing?

214
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,089
There's nothing to talk about.

215
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,049
Same problem. It's just getting worse.

216
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,562
Have you reached out to Duane?

217
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,800
Well,

218
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,165
maybe

219
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,003
he can help you get the crew certified.

220
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,406
What?

221
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,326
What?

222
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,845
Why are you so good to me?

223
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,405
Hell if I know.

224
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,326
-Bye, have a nice night.
-Thank you so much.

225
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,360
Hey-

226
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,522
Yes, it's yours, I'm sure.

227
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,286
Damn.

228
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,729
All right,
how long have you been pregnant?

229
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,486
-Five months.
-Five months? Are you serious?

230
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,969
Dude, you're not even gonna tell me,
maybe earlier or something?

231
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,565
Brendan, 'cause I don't wanna hear it.
I don't.

232
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,130
Well, look, I deserve a say in all this.

233
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,651
-Okay, then what do you wanna say?
-I called you, I've...

234
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,721
Say something!

235
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,568
-I don't know.
-You don't care about me.

236
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,927
You never did.
You broke up with me with a text.

237
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,565
Yeah, I know. Look, I didn't know.

238
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,880
Yeah, and what if you did?

239
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,161
What would you have done?

240
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,401
Marry me?

241
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,241
All right.

242
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,606
Look, that is part mine, okay?

243
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,727
It is.

244
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,289
So, I'm gonna be responsible for it.

245
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,162
You're not responsible for anything.

246
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,961
My family and I have this on our own.

247
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,849
I want you to stay away.

248
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,845
If that's what you want.

249
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,481
Damn.

250
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,691
We catch you doing that shit in here
again and we'll make you choke on it.

251
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,801
Asswipe.

252
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,961
Shit, B.

253
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,241
You okay?

254
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,162
I've been dreaming of this.

255
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,129
The day you bring me up here
to the point.

256
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,725
Oh, God, would you stop?

257
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,290
What the hell are we doing here?

258
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,329
Take a good hard look out there.

259
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,601
What do you see?

260
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,401
Fuel.

261
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,206
Lot of good folks lost their home
down at Cave Creek.

262
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,330
Bitch kicked your ass, huh?

263
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,403
But had I been able to cut and burn
the lawn, we could've kicked hers.

264
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,281
Tough beat.

265
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,643
We've been training for over four years.

266
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,690
We've got all our hours,
all our qualifications,

267
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,562
can out-hump any hotshot crew out there,

268
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,291
but until we're certified,
we ain't nothing but a bunch of deucers.

269
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,964
We can't do anything. Can't do shit.

270
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,845
Well, I told you it wouldn't be easy.

271
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,925
Doing something that's
never been done before takes time.

272
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,810
You know I lost two more good dudes
to Blue River?

273
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,409
City council and mayor
have got my ass on the chopping block.

274
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,845
We ain't got any more time.

275
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,770
Neither does our hometown.

276
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,127
Sooner or later, the fire,
she's gonna come a-knockin‘,

277
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,851
and when she does, this whole place
is gonna go off like a powder keg.

278
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,367
And when she does, my crew won't even
be able to set foot on the line.

279
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,847
Eric, that attitude
that you got right there,

280
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,922
that cost you a lot of friends
in the department.

281
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,889
-I don't care.
-Friends that cou|d've helped.

282
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,244
Come on, Duane,
you're the Wildland fire chief.

283
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,564
You started this thing.

284
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,921
Well...

285
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,885
I need your help.

286
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,009
-Please?
-Hey. Now, that's nice.

287
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,046
That's a good start.

288
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,404
Come on, we'll get this thing.

289
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,245
<i>Look, listen, I'm in</i>

290
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,685
Camp Verde Jail.

291
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,201
And...

292
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,408
Nah, it was just, like,
a misunderstanding,

293
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,050
or whatever, honestly.

294
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,521
But the bail's, like, a grand,
so I was...

295
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,125
I was seeing if you could post that.

296
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,686
Hello?

297
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,406
Mom?

298
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,524
Now, there are two things
that'll make the mayor move.

299
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,329
-Sorry, baby.
-Fear and greed, right?

300
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,569
Yeah, but until the fire's knocking
at his door, we don't have the fear.

301
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,040
Yeah, once the crew gets certified
as hotshot, then the city,

302
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,042
they can charge 49 bucks an hour per man

303
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,090
when they're working a fire on federal
or state land, right?

304
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,049
This is bringing money into Prescott.

305
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,203
Wait, don't they have to get evaluated
so they can get certified?

306
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,448
I'm gonna get them their evaluation.

307
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,684
Now, if you're willing
to commit your boys

308
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,923
to working more than what the average
hotshot crew covers in a season,

309
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,764
I'm talking about
a lot of overtime, now...

310
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,841
Yeah, it's no problem.

311
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,446
We'll work the full fire season,
no breaks.

312
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,731
I'm so sorry.

313
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,201
You okay?

314
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,961
Yes, thank you.

315
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,883
It's not easy sharing your man
with a fire. I know.

316
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,090
I'm just being a baby.

317
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,330
You know, I don't even know why,

318
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,167
when I went into this
with my eyes wide open.

319
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,288
Doesn't mean you can see
everything that's coming.

320
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,125
It's important to him.

321
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,566
I'll make it work.

322
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,811
Hey. Just one.

323
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,006
Well, at least you don't have kids
and grandkids to worry about.

324
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,081
Right.

325
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,611
<i>...Sunday, 8:00 p.m.</i>

326
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,762
<i>Temperatures 115 to 122...</i>

327
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,125
I don't wanna talk about it.

328
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,050
Yeah? Neither do I, Brendan.

329
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,768
- What is this?
- I'll be home at 7:00.

330
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,366
When I get back, I want you gone.

331
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,449
Dude, are you serious?

332
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,006
Dude, what... Oh, my God.

333
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,082
You boys been beating me off with
this scheme for the last three years,

334
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,242
and the city
still hasn't made a damn dime yet.

335
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,643
Huck, you saw the numbers.

336
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,327
This crew, it's a real moneymaker
once they get certified.

337
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,930
Well, when's that gonna be?

338
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,288
As I understand it, they've done
all the time and obligations needed.

339
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,806
This is the first city
to ever start its own crew,

340
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,441
so the Feds see us as outsiders, like
a threat to their way of doing things.

341
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,921
They're trying to put us off
by stalling our evaluation.

342
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,889
-That's right.
-Look, the people of Prescott

343
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,611
don't understand why they're paying
for their own hotshot crew.

344
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,401
And the city council,
well, they think it's overkill,

345
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,642
like having a SEAL Team Six
do the job of a sheriff.

346
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,925
The Rodeo Fire, it torched the rim above
Payson before they could get on it.

347
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,923
The Indian Fire burned
right up to our doorstep.

348
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,520
It's only a matter of time

349
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,610
before Prescott is gonna be dealing
with a massive wildfire.

350
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,045
-That's right.
-And when it comes,

351
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,329
the people living here, they're gonna be
thanking their bold, long-sighted mayor

352
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,165
that they've got their very own
SEAL Team Six of hotshots

353
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,685
to put it down quick.

354
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,527
Are the Rusty Pistols gonna play
at the rodeo this year?

355
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,330
Wouldn't have it any other way.

356
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,688
Are you gonna ride that
big old mule of yours to the show?

357
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,921
Oh, shit, yeah.

358
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,642
You got to the end of the season
to get yourself evaluated and certified.

359
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,768
And you got next season
to prove your worth.

360
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,689
But it's all on you, Duane.

361
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,886
Appreciate this, Mayor.

362
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,167
- You will not regret this, sir.
- Well, I hope not.

363
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,686
Now, you boys keep your powder dry.

364
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,162
-Thank you.
-Hey, Dave. Good to see you.

365
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,691
That's our mayor.

366
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,926
Hey, Brendan.

367
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,291
Your daughter Michaela was born
six minutes ago. Congrats.

368
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,926
She's totally healthy?

369
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,647
-Nothing wrong with her or nothing?
-No, she's perfect.

370
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,041
-How's the mom doing?
-She's all good.

371
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,160
Listen, they're gonna put the baby
in the nursery in a little while

372
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,446
so mom can rest.

373
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,005
I'll come get you, okay?

374
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,411
-Yeah. All right.
-All right.

375
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,971
-Thanks, man.
-Yeah.

376
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,160
Wade Scott Parker.

377
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,170
So, your father's a captain
on Chino Valley Fire?

378
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,566
Yes, sir.

379
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,891
So, I'm assuming you know the difference

380
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,042
between structure
and wildland fighting operations.

381
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,121
I do.

382
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,762
Wildland firefighters, they dig line,

383
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,448
they cut trees,
light backburns to corral the fire.

384
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,205
-They try to control it.
-Yep.

385
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,205
We fight fire with fire.

386
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,165
What does the word "integrity"
mean to you?

387
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,447
For shit's sake, Jesse, can we please
get to the good questions?

388
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,931
What? Okay.

389
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,324
When was the last time you lied?

390
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,967
I guess to my mom, this morning.

391
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,041
About what?

392
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,930
I told her that this job isn't
as dangerous as working structure.

393
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,170
Are you lying to me right now?

394
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,481
No, sir.

395
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,246
-You a short-timer?
-A what, sir?

396
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,089
A firefighter's son
looking to use my crew

397
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,481
as a stepping stone to a gig
on the structure side.

398
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,205
-No, sir.
-Now, you'd better not be,

399
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,647
'cause if there's one thing
I can't stand, it's that.

400
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,721
Yes, sir.

401
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,521
You got any running gear?

402
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,525
I do, sir. In the car.

403
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,206
All right, we're gonna go for a little
hike in a bit, me and the boys.

404
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,805
Come along, we'll give you a look-see.

405
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,606
Thank you, sir.

406
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,088
-Why are you still here?
-Sorry, sir.

407
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,086
I like him.

408
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,921
Nice shot!

409
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,644
-One point.
-One point for these guys.

410
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,166
I got it.

411
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,530
Clown was in my EMT course.
Serious burnout.

412
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,130
-What's he doing here?
-I don't know.

413
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,805
Let's find out, shall we?

414
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,283
- Brian, right?
- It's Brendan.

415
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,521
Right.

416
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,205
You were in my EMT class.

417
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,730
What's up? You...

418
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,561
You lost, or...

419
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,564
No, I was just checking.

420
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,369
You know, I heard you guys
had some slots available.

421
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,725
Slots are all filled, man.

422
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,046
Sorry, dude.

423
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,287
-All right. Thanks, man.
-Yeah.

424
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,886
Hey-

425
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,247
We got one slot open.
You want to interview for it?

426
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,920
Yeah. Right now?

427
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,681
Yeah, right now.

428
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,206
All right.

429
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,048
I'm Eric Marsh,
superintendent of Crew 7.

430
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,485
Brendan McDonough.

431
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,089
When was the last time you used?

432
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,921
Don't think, just answer the question.

433
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,531
Three months ago.

434
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,762
-Ever use needles?
-No.

435
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,811
Never.

436
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,449
Do you have your qualifications?

437
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,561
Yeah.

438
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,447
Wildland fire, fire science,
and just completed my EMT.

439
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,162
You know the difference between
Type <i>2</i> crew and Type 1 IHC?

440
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,083
Yes, sir.
Hotshots are on the front line,

441
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,810
and they get to
engage the fire directly.

442
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,846
Good.

443
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,846
You got a record?

444
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,246
Yeah.

445
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,560
Felony larceny.

446
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,565
You ever do any time?

447
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,371
Three days.

448
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,404
And I'm on probation right now.

449
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,205
What are you doing here?

450
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,641
I made a lot of mistakes in my life,

451
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,247
and I've done a lot of things
that I'm ashamed of

452
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,048
and I'm embarrassed by, honestly,

453
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,124
but I just had a daughter.

454
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,250
Her name's Michaela

455
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,087
and I just really wanna give her
what I never had.

456
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,168
If you give me a chance,
I won't let you down.

457
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,481
Okay.

458
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,651
All right.
The crew's gonna go on a little hike.

459
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,131
You got any running gear?

460
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,681
No.

461
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,091
What size shoe do you wear?

462
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,322
- Ten.
- Hand 'em over.

463
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,970
They're... They're brand new, Supe.

464
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,929
Yeah, I don't give a shit.
Hand 'em over.

465
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,286
McDonough!

466
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,966
Come on.

467
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,721
Come on.

468
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,608
They're... They're limited edition, sir.

469
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,841
Yeah? Okay.

470
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,126
There you go.

471
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,080
Thanks, man.

472
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,125
-Are those limited edition?
-Shut up.

473
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,484
What's up with that Brendan kid?

474
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,571
- You're not serious about him, are you?
- It's up to him.

475
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,649
This kid's a train wreck.

476
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,287
Mack was in his EMT class,
said he's into dope.

477
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,766
I'm talking hard shit.

478
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,526
What you doing, Supe? We're trying
to get certified as hotshots here.

479
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,244
All you rookies that are just coming on
as slot contenders,

480
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,487
I want you all to breathe in
this beautiful vista.

481
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,165
Breathe it in deeply.

482
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,603
'Cause after you all get baptized,

483
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,124
you're never gonna be able
to look out into the wilds

484
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,043
and see that pure beauty again.

485
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,003
Once you get a real hard taste
of the bitch at work,

486
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,162
there's only one thing
you're gonna be able to see,

487
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,765
and that's fuel.

488
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,650
So, think about that.

489
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,045
Meditate on it.

490
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,649
Then decide if this job is for you.

491
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,770
-Line it out!
-Line it out!

492
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,650
-Come on, guys, line it out.
-Line it out!

493
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,446
Line it out!

494
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,044
You think he dropped dead on the trail?

495
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,691
Definite possibility.

496
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,364
If that shit stain died in my new kicks,
I'm gonna kill him, Supe.

497
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,766
Oh, well.

498
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,011
-Hey, Supe.
-What?

499
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,241
Check it out.

500
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,321
What?

501
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,288
Oh, my Lord.

502
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,481
All right.

503
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,370
See you 6:00 a.m. Monday.

504
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,401
You all right?

505
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,244
-Yeah.
-Yeah? Can you drive?

506
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,166
-Yeah.
-Okay.

507
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,769
Pound tons of electrolytes, take some
Motrin, get some sleep, buddy.

508
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,285
You'll be all right.

509
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,965
Hey, I got your kicks.

510
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,404
You owe me 100 bucks.

511
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,128
Duane saw it headed this way.

512
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,404
Thought it looked lost,
too young to be on its own.

513
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,050
She came through here.

514
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,127
Who dumps a young horse here to die?

515
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,331
Like it was nothing.

516
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,765
Well, we'll find her.

517
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,200
That way.

518
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,646
Let's go.

519
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,730
Ten minutes!

520
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,529
Come on, 10 minutes, shitbirds!

521
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,161
Hey, let's go, Bravo! Let's go, Bravo!
Kick it up, max level!

522
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,527
You don't wanna be buying
Alpha's rounds all night!

523
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,886
Come on!

524
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,490
Norris, pop quiz.

525
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,086
You're cutting a line on a side hill
below the fire.

526
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,323
Debris and logs could start to roll down
and cross your line. What do you do?

527
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,882
Build a cup trench and move the logs
so they're up and down the slope.

528
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,122
There it is. Outstanding.

529
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,929
Hey, McDonough, pop quiz

530
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,244
What's your 11th watch-out?

531
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,211
No, don't look at him. Look at me.
What's your 11th watch-out?

532
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,368
The fire line you're cutting
hasn't been anchored.

533
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,726
Wrong. That's the 8th.

534
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,969
-You're getting spot fires across...
-That's 16th!

535
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,531
Alpha Squad, hold!

536
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,649
What's your 11th watch-out?

537
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,882
Unburned fuel between you and the fire.

538
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,445
Firefighters died for us
so we could learn all these watch-outs.

539
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,121
If you get another one wrong,
I will choke you out.

540
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,481
Yes, sir.

541
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,723
Alpha Squad, 100 off the deck. Now!

542
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,285
-Come on!
-My bad, guys.

543
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,766
Let's go, Bravo!

544
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,041
Hey, McDipshit,
can you get any more challenged?

545
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,487
You got dick right
since you've been here.

546
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,040
Zero.

547
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,202
-Goddamn donut.
-McDonut.

548
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,521
I know you're doing this for your
baby girl, but I don't know, dude.

549
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,684
I've heard some shit about her mama.

550
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,003
You sure that kid's even yours, bro?

551
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,926
McDonough!

552
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,525
Do it. Throw that punch.

553
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,370
Do it. Come on.

554
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,767
-Do it.
-Quit on yourself.

555
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,205
Go home. Die.

556
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,207
All right, Bravo, get back to work!

557
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,004
That was way out of line, Mack.

558
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,329
I don't mind you sweating the rooks,
but you don't bring in family.

559
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,281
You hear me?

560
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,566
Crew 7, keep it moving, keep it moving!

561
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,130
- Deploy! DepbY!
- Deploy!

562
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,451
Rookies on the inside!
Flames over that way!

563
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,727
Feet to the flames, feet to the flames!

564
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,121
Go, go, go!

565
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,690
Bottles and radios in the shelter!

566
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,882
-Let's go, let's go! Move!
-Get rid of your tools!

567
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,167
-Go, go, go! Hurry it up!
-Boys, let's go, let's go!

568
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,481
Come on, speed it up! Fire's chasing us!

569
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,841
-Move it, rookie, come on!
-Go, go, go, go!

570
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,684
-Seven, six...
-Everybody in!

571
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,482
...five, four, three, two, one!

572
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,531
All right, listen up.

573
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,970
Burnover is seconds away,

574
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,566
and it sounds like 100
freight trains right on top of you.

575
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,522
The wind ripping like a hurricane,

576
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,129
heat coming on LOGO-plus degrees.

577
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,645
It's the apocalypse.

578
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,881
And remember,

579
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,890
stay locked down,
bury your face in that cool dirt,

580
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,962
'cause as long as you can breathe,
you can survive.

581
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,209
When this thing finally sweeps over you,

582
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,044
it's gonna feel like
the end of the world.

583
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,290
No matter what you hear,

584
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,204
no matter what's going on...

585
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,761
What the...

586
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,726
-Who's in there?
-Rose. Rose.

587
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,088
ls that your sock next to your shelter?

588
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,131
-What?
-That's Rosie's beat-off sock, sir.

589
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,731
I asked you a question.

590
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,762
No, it's definitely not my sock, sir.
I don't...

591
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,285
Then why is your name written on it?

592
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,646
'Cause it's his sock, sir.

593
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,325
Mack, out of the shelter!

594
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,365
I don't wanna come out, Steed.

595
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,284
I don't blame you.
Get out of the shelter, MacKenzie!

596
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,091
Come on, California boy! Come on up!

597
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,567
-Stand up.
-You're such an asshole.

598
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,605
Do you think this is funny?

599
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,201
I wear anklets.

600
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,409
- Ankle socks.
- Is he a joke to you?

601
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,803
<i>-Hi, this is</i> Marsh.
<i>-What's up?</i>

602
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,689
Just running a deployment drill.

603
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,249
-What you <i>got?</i>
-New start in the Chiricahua Mountains.

604
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,041
Ate up 9,000 acres since yesterday.

605
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,691
They ordered up a Type 2 ICS team.

606
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,961
So, mount up.

607
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,770
This is it, Eric, game time.

608
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,401
What do you mean?

609
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,324
<i>I called in a favor
with an IC that owes me.</i>

610
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,681
Hayes.

611
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,122
You're being evaluated.

612
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,444
I'll hit you with the details.

613
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,081
Good luck.

614
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,041
Okay, got it.

615
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,128
I feel like your mother.
You're my second-favorite son.

616
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,283
All right, gather up!

617
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,646
Got some news.

618
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,564
We're heading to a fire down south.

619
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,131
And we're getting our eval on it.

620
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,884
Settle down, settle down.
Remember, when we do this,

621
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,729
act like we've done it before.

622
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,331
Hey, Ryder.

623
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,401
Hey, I'm sorry I'm missing
your birthday again, buster.

624
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,721
But you know what?

625
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,564
We're having a second party
when I get back.

626
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,923
- It's gonna be even better, okay?
-"Good night, stars. Good night, air.

627
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,806
"Good night, noises everywhere."

628
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,565
When I come home a hotshot,
what are you gonna do?

629
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,965
Babe, babe, I just...
I just need a little motivation.

630
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,408
I mean, give me something deep,
give me something nasty to think about.

631
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,162
I like it.

632
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,646
You got to go?

633
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,246
Okay.

634
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,921
Okay, bye.

635
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,041
Donut.

636
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,926
Rookie.

637
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,881
My girl, Cheyanne.

638
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,961
Nice.

639
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,041
Nice?

640
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,327
I mean, that is a world-beating
piece of ass right there.

641
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,528
Look at those superstar titties of hers.

642
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,242
I mean, if we get certified as hotshots,
she's gonna do things to me.

643
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,726
Do you understand?

644
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,681
Hey, bring it in.

645
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,481
Bring it in.

646
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,290
Come on, just nice and tight.

647
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,450
I hope you do understand,

648
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,521
because we've been working to get
this eval for over four years now, bro.

649
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,161
And a lot can happen to a little
puke like you out on the line.

650
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:09,404
And if you do anything,
I mean anything, to mess our shit up,

651
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,727
something's definitely
gonna happen to you.

652
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,371
Okay, good chat.

653
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,847
Look at you, looking like a cat
eating shit out of a hairbrush.

654
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,561
This is it, Papa.

655
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,525
We're gonna crush this eval.

656
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,404
Yeah, let's just do what we do.

657
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,442
<i>Weather's working against us right now.</i>

658
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,490
Wind's gusting to 20
and the humidity is dropping.

659
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,849
Fire's got two heads at the moment.

660
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,122
Hotshot crews in Division Echo

661
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,851
will look at cutting direct line here.

662
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,206
Division Alpha will build
an indirect line here.

663
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,846
Now, that line is our trigger point.

664
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:06,324
If the fire crosses it, we'll look
at evacuating the city of Portal,

665
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,528
5 miles to the northeast.

666
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,643
Good luck. Be careful.

667
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,446
Are you Marsh?

668
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,284
Yes, sir, Eric Marsh, Crew 7.

669
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,010
- Hayes.
- Pleasure, sir.

670
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,683
-My captain, Jesse Steed.
-Nice to meet you.

671
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,524
All right. So, what are we doing?

672
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,762
Well, it looks like
we're in Division Alpha.

673
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,081
We're gonna cut a line along the base
of this hill right there.

674
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,811
Yeah, there's no direct access there,
so we'll helo in, spike out.

675
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,601
All right, well,
let's see what you boys got.

676
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,762
Hey, don't puke, you pukes.

677
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,167
All right.

678
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,645
Bravo Squad!

679
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,047
Bravo Squad, watch that slope there!

680
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,806
Jesse, where you at?

681
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,563
<i>Scouting two ridges over.
Got brands coming in, spot ﬁres.</i>

682
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,608
<i>Nothing crazy,
but she's definitely headed our way.</i>

683
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,049
All right, why don't you work
your way back down to the crew?

684
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,248
- I'm gonna go scout ahead.
- Copy that.

685
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,243
You got a high-speed, low-drag crew,

686
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,322
but how long can you run them
at that pace?

687
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,931
Well, as long as it takes.

688
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,361
Bad cut! Tree coming down!

689
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,688
-Fa||ing!
-Fa||ing!

690
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,331
Division Alpha, this is Crew 7.

691
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,402
You got a spot weather forecast for me?

692
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,043
<i>We have a storm cell
kicking up from the south.</i>

693
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,885
<i>High-wind advisory.
25 to 30 miles per hour.</i>

694
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,129
<i>All right, copy that. Thank you.</i>

695
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,648
Want a piece of my Carolina ass?

696
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,446
Come and get it.

697
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,769
Fire's making a run toward our line.

698
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,691
By the time she gets here,
she's gonna be too strong to hold.

699
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,003
It's gonna crown that ridge, spot over,
and run straight into town.

700
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,730
If we backburn
this side of the mountain,

701
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,451
by the time bitch comes over,
she'll have no fuel to feed into.

702
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,369
That's a god-awful idea.

703
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,769
All the conditions favor the fire,

704
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,729
and when that blaze
comes down that mountain,

705
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,724
it's gonna kick your ass
and use your burn to get even stronger.

706
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,211
We won't be able to stop it.

707
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,726
Okay, well, our line's not gonna hold
unless we burn it off.

708
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,006
But it'll slow it down,

709
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,367
maybe give us a chance
to get other resources up here.

710
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,726
Okay, what you don't understand, sir...

711
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,600
Well, what you don't understand
is 40 years, son.

712
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,890
I was on the job
when you were still shitting yellow.

713
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,169
So, if you think you're gonna
make a big move and impress me,

714
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,368
I'm telling you right now, don't.

715
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,647
Due respect, you're just an observer.

716
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,006
So, let us do ourjob, okay?

717
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,605
-No, you're not a...
-No, no, step off!

718
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,842
Now. Step off.

719
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,406
Damn.

720
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,925
What's y'a||'s comfort level?

721
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,327
-Are you down for the cause?
-Let's get after it, then.

722
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,245
-Get some.
-Boss.

723
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,807
Division Alpha, this is Crew 7.

724
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,085
ls that a rosary?

725
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,084
No, prayer beads.

726
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,931
Buddhist, huh?

727
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,847
Well, this thing goes sideways,
nothing's gonna save you.

728
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,611
Not even Buddha.

729
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,640
Holy shit, dude.

730
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,802
Can't believe we're about to light up
a couple thousand acres.

731
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,325
Chill, bro, this is what we do.

732
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,000
Once you light that fuse, you throw it
deep into the fire, all right?

733
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,206
Yeah, cool.

734
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,645
<i>Mack, Steed.</i>

735
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,405
<i>Putting fuel on the ground now.
Make sure you stay ahead of us.</i>

736
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,800
Copy that.

737
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,201
Here we go.

738
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,965
Nice. All right, uno <i>més.</i>

739
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,285
-Hey, you all right?
-Shit.

740
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,404
-Dude, shit, go.
-Bees, man.

741
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,125
-Bro, run. Bro, go.
-Go! Go!

742
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,884
Run! Bees! Bees, man!

743
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,843
-Shit!
-They're stinging my balls!

744
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,201
Who said that?

745
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,283
Dude, karma's a bitch, ain't it, Mack?

746
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,489
-Rose.
-What?

747
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,971
That went in my asshole.

748
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,649
-Jesus.
-You ever read the Bible?

749
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,089
Yeah. I mean, not like you, but...

750
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,321
Yeah, it's good.

751
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,166
Well, that worked.

752
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,884
No matter what Hayes thinks.

753
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,245
Get some sleep, Papa.

754
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,687
It's for my boy, Ryder.
I bring him home a rock...

755
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,886
-Snag!
-Shit!

756
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,770
Holy shit!

757
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,285
Everybody okay?

758
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,766
-Yeah!
-Yeah, we're okay.

759
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,245
All right, keep it moving!

760
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,966
Thanks, man.

761
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,565
What?

762
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,324
-Where's your chinstrap?
-My what?

763
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,971
-Your chinny!
-You can't fly without a strap, Donut!

764
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,883
- Shit, I don't know. I just had it, man.
- Hey, we got to run.

765
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,849
I got no time for this.
Mack, set him up!

766
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,566
Donut!

767
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,926
Hey!

768
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,883
I think this is yours!

769
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,406
Hey-

770
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,966
However this shakes out,
just know we saved all that.

771
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,442
Jesse. Jesse, what... What happened?

772
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,602
Hey, hey, settle down, Manda-bear.
It's me.

773
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,524
Jesus Christ, Eric.

774
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,730
<i>I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.</i>

775
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,647
I got my phone smashed up this morning.

776
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,650
<i>So, you're on your way back?</i>

777
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,046
Yeah.

778
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,281
How'd it go?

779
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,530
I think I really messed up.

780
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,491
What do you mean? What happened?

781
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,643
<i>I called a play out on the line,
and I know it was the right thing to do</i>

782
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,721
<i>and I'd do it again,</i>

783
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,120
but I think it's gonna cost us
our certification.

784
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,291
I'm really sorry.

785
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,441
Yeah.

786
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,760
Well,

787
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,244
I peed in my pants today.

788
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,481
You...

789
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,601
You what?

790
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,451
<i>I peed in my pants.</i>

791
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,091
- Really?
- Yeah-.

792
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:35,723
<i>I was working with a colt
over at Sam Lapeefs ranch,</i>

793
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,967
and I had to go really bad,

794
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,123
and the colt just reared up
and came down hard on my foot.

795
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,525
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

796
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,768
I'm fine except I peed in my pants.

797
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,088
-Did anybody see it?
-Everyone.

798
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,481
-They did?
-I felt like a jerk.

799
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,400
And then I had to borrow pants from Sam
just to get home.

800
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,890
You know how much I love you?

801
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,926
<i>Go back to sleep.
I'll see you in</i> a <i>little while, okay?</i>

802
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,729
-Okay.
-Thank you for that.

803
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,926
<i>See you soon.</i>

804
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,041
-Nig <i>ht.
Wight-night.</i>

805
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,491
<i>-This is</i> Marsh.
<i>-Hey, Eric, how did it go on the eval?</i>

806
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,846
<i>Did you ﬁnd out?
Do you know if you're good?</i>

807
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:51,921
-Dale.
-What?

808
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,281
-|... I can't talk right now, Dale.
-What?

809
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,966
God.

810
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,326
Where is he?

811
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,881
Office.

812
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,845
Hey...

813
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,606
Come in.

814
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,881
God.

815
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,289
What the hell happened out there?

816
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,164
I did what I thought was right.

817
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:10,926
And the boys, man,
were they a sight to see.

818
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,651
I've never been so proud.

819
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,086
DepIOY-

820
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,924
-I mean it. Deploy now!
-Let's go, boys!

821
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,331
-Move, move, move!
-Fire's that way!

822
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,845
Come on, let's show him how it's done.

823
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,487
Hey, make some space, Rosie.
Come on, man.

824
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,846
Face to the floor!

825
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,251
Twenty bucks I beat you, Mack.

826
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,844
Mack, what are you doing? Hurry!

827
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,764
Five, four, three...

828
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,923
-Come on, get down, get down!
-...two, one.

829
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,965
Thirty-two seconds.

830
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,409
That's very, very good.

831
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,284
I know you boys
had a rough go of it out there,

832
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,044
but if you're looking for sympathy,

833
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:10,090
the only place you're gonna find it
is in the dictionary,

834
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,881
somewhere between "shit" and "syphilis."

835
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,284
All right, come on out.

836
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,691
Here's the deal.

837
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,690
I spoke with Hayes.

838
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:26,363
He thinks your supe here
is a real cocky sucker,

839
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,769
but he thinks you all

840
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:32,083
are one of the best damn crews
he's ever seen.

841
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,644
Congratulations.

842
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,726
You're hotshots.

843
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,050
- Nice!
- Hell, yeah!

844
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,360
-Hotshots!
-Sweet!

845
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,401
Woyjeck!

846
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,886
All right, hey.

847
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,805
We... We need a name.

848
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,291
How about Thumb Butte Hotshots?

849
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:00,283
-Boo!
-I got it, I got it, I got it.

850
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,726
The Firelords.

851
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,881
-No.
-Why not?

852
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,731
-That's the name of your band, bro.
-Yeah, and we slay.

853
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,768
Yeah, you slay, in your mama's garage.

854
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,685
Granite Mountain.

855
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,521
Yeah.

856
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,930
Granite Mountain Hotshots.

857
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,451
-There it is!
-Yeah.

858
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:23,881
There it is.

859
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,001
Hey-

860
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,486
Hey-

861
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,326
I appreciate you making the effort.

862
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,171
Leaving the stuff.

863
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,488
Yeah, yeah. It's no problem.

864
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,446
Wow, you look...

865
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,687
Yeah, I know, I'm pretty filthy.
We were just...

866
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,042
We were doing a fire down south.

867
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,841
Chiricahua.

868
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,366
Yeah, I heard that
you were working for Crew 7.

869
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,410
Yeah, actually, we just...
We just got certified today as hotshots,

870
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,848
so we're the Granite Mountain Hotshots.

871
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,169
That's amazing. Congrats.

872
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,485
-She's so pretty.
-Yeah.

873
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,411
Do you wanna hold her?

874
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,441
Nah, I'm...

875
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,766
You know, I'm so dirty.
I don't wanna mess up her clothes.

876
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,569
It's okay, really. It's fine.

877
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,604
-Here. Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah, I'd love... Yeah, please.

878
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:50,965
A little gas.

879
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,521
She's so pretty.

880
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,647
Yeah. She looks like you.

881
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,401
Nat...

882
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,571
I'm sorry.

883
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,961
It's okay.

884
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,610
You ladies better listen up
and listen good.

885
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,047
If there's one thing I know,
it's applesauce.

886
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:27,965
Go ahead and try that, darling.

887
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,201
Okay.

888
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:34,807
That's right.

889
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,246
-That is good applesauce.
-That's right. Yes, it is.

890
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,243
Best dang applesauce you ever had.

891
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,731
Okay, it was cute at first.

892
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,121
Now I just wanna scream.

893
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,440
ls that yours and that's him?

894
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,760
-That's both.
-That was. ..

895
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,922
-And who's that? ls that his?
-This is the one we lost.

896
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,971
That's yours. Okay, keep that
away from the kid. Make sure.

897
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,610
- I'm gonna get some water.
- What? Okay.

898
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,407
Smoking is over for you. It's over.

899
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,561
Sound familiar?

900
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,844
You got that... Stay still, stay still.

901
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:11,367
Wait a minute. I'll wipe...
I'll wipe that off for you.

902
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,246
You must be Brendan.

903
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,971
- Yes, ma'am.
- I'm Amanda, Eric's wife.

904
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,322
- So nice to meet you.
- I've heard a lot about you.

905
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,802
-How's it going?
-It's good.

906
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,882
-Yeah?
-Yeah. I...

907
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,841
You know,
I really appreciate the opportunity.

908
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:39,806
And I really respect your husband a lot.

909
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:43,369
So, I hope to be more like him someday.

910
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,128
You guys have more in common
than you think.

911
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,201
Hang in there.

912
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:52,681
Thanks.

913
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,000
Where are you taking me?

914
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,162
-I want to show you something.
-All right.

915
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,326
What?

916
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:02,926
For me?

917
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,207
-You gonna take care of this one?
-Yeah.

918
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,441
God.

919
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,888
-What's up, Mack?
-What up?

920
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,406
Everything all right?

921
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,728
No, dude, far from it.

922
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,565
Anything you wanna talk about?

923
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,042
You remember my gal Cheyanne, right?

924
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,888
-Yeah.
-Yeah, well, I came home

925
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,282
and found the slut
had been cheating on me.

926
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,206
'Right?
- Really?

927
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,645
But you know what the kicker is?

928
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:00,408
The kicker is she's banging some dude
on Flagstaff PD.

929
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:02,881
Yeah.

930
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,324
-I mean, whatever, you know.
-Whatever.

931
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,410
I mean, what I got to find

932
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,610
is a new place, 'cause I moved out
of our apartment into my car.

933
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,001
Bitch.

934
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,321
I mean, hey, I got an extra room.

935
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,561
Seriously?

936
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,041
Yeah.

937
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:35,609
You know, if you need
a spot to crash for a little bit.

938
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,485
Right on, dude.

939
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:47,051
Man, I just got to kick out my buddy
from the Flagstaff PD.

940
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,601
He...

941
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,321
Funny 9W-

942
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,323
Yeah, his name...
His name's... His name's Dave.

943
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:54,806
Man, I'll tell you,

944
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,124
as true as I'm standing here
and as strange as this is,

945
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:00,761
I'm happY-

946
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,568
I'm happy and grateful to everyone,

947
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,409
the families, my crew,

948
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,604
Duane, Amanda.

949
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,571
You know, Granite Mountain

950
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:12,729
is the first municipal hotshot crew
in this entire country.

951
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,808
Can you believe that?
That's saying something.

952
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,280
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it,

953
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,721
this first season as hotshots
is gonna be tough.

954
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,883
We're gonna be traveling
all over the country.

955
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,764
We're gonna be working harder,
going longer,

956
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:30,731
so it's important that this
Granite Mountain family pulls together

957
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,725
and looks out for each other.

958
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,242
'Cause we can't do this
without your support.

959
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:36,321
That's right.

960
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,370
<i>Esse quam videri.</i>

961
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,926
"To be, rather than to seem."

962
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:46,081
And everybody here
has lived up to this creed.

963
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:51,046
No supe could be prouder,

964
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:55,727
right now, of his boys
than I am of you guys.

965
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,121
So, to commemorate this occasion,

966
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,290
I had some tees made up.

967
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,606
All right?

968
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,202
Now, you can only wear them
if you're a hotshot.

969
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:07,846
Right?

970
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:11,411
Okay, so it's sleeping
with a hotshot, too, okay?

971
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,366
There you go.

972
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:30,247
There she is, little Michaela.

973
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,929
You want to show Mack your dog?

974
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,764
Your dad and Uncle Mack are stoked

975
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:37,047
you're having your first sleepover
with us.

976
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:40,489
-She's got a puppy...
-Dude, what did you do?

977
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,611
I baby-proofed everything,

978
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,650
like the bathroom cabinets, the kitchen,
the whole house, basically.

979
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,451
-So, we're good.
-That's awesome, man. Thank you.

980
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,365
Why not?

981
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,602
-She loves this dog, man.
-Yeah.

982
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,331
Family, bro.

983
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,046
Let's get the bunny.

984
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,441
You like the bunny.

985
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,443
Yeah, he's a friend.

986
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,648
-Hello.
-Dude, what took you so long?

987
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:17,166
-How's she doing?
-She's, like... She's really hot, man.

988
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,004
-She's, like, burning up.
-Oh, God.

989
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,368
I know. I know. It's okay.

990
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,768
This is your friend. She's your friend.

991
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,482
-Hey, bro. The other way.
-Okay.

992
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,684
The other end.

993
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,205
-This?
-No.

994
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:35,601
What?

995
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,288
103.4! Dude!

996
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,441
<i>No bueno, man.</i>

997
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,448
Call the pediatrician number
Natalie gave you.

998
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:45,726
I called him like five times.

999
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,802
-He's not picking up.
-What do you mean, he hasn't picked up?

1000
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,763
-I don't know, he's being an asshole!
-We gotta go to the hospital.

1001
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:50,961
Yeah, right, man.

1002
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:53,407
It's my first night alone with her.
Natalie will never let me see her again.

1003
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:54,561
Yeah, you're right.

1004
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:58,681
Turbyfi||! His wife, Stephanie.
I think she's a nurse.

1005
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,487
Hey, how's she doing?

1006
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:06,849
Her temperature's coming down.
Her coloring's good. She's fine.

1007
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,081
Yeah, she's good?

1008
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:12,684
Infants run high fevers sometimes.
It's totally normal. Yeah.

1009
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:17,206
All right. Good. Thank you.

1010
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,841
Yeah, I didn't know that's how you took
a temperature.

1011
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,445
All right, men. I think we're good.

1012
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:27,166
-She's... Yeah, she's happy, so...
-Good, man.

1013
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,281
Yeah.

1014
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,682
I really appreciate you guys coming by.

1015
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,441
It's what we're here for, bro.

1016
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,801
Man, like, I've been through
some pretty crazy, intense shit,

1017
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:42,283
but that was, hands down,
the scariest thing of my life.

1018
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,521
Seriously.

1019
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,365
Welcome to fatherhood, dude.

1020
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,244
Yeah, I'm gonna pump
the brakes on having kids.

1021
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,522
Just the thought of fire season starting
makes me lonely.

1022
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,327
Well, once this crew proves itself
this first season,

1023
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,761
we'll be able to slow down a little bit.

1024
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,329
You know,

1025
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:11,046
the other wives, they always say,

1026
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:14,283
"At least you don't have kids.
It's so much harder with kids."

1027
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,201
Yeah.

1028
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,531
It's starting to get under my skin.

1029
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,887
Really? Why?

1030
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:30,210
'Cause those kids give them something
to hold onto and love.

1031
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,890
No matter what.

1032
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,607
-You know what?
-W hat?

1033
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,367
If I could put you in my pocket,

1034
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,010
- I'd take you wherever I go.
- Yeah.

1035
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:43,770
-I would.
-Don't do that.

1036
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:46,600
Don't do what?

1037
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:48,802
I want to talk about it.

1038
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,928
Well, okay, what?

1039
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,964
Kids?

1040
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,565
Us.

1041
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,042
Having a family.

1042
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,607
Look, we had an understanding
when we got married.

1043
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:02,451
-And you agreed to it.
-Yeah, I know, I agreed.

1044
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:06,610
I guess I never felt like
I was worthy of being a mother before.

1045
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:10,202
Yeah, but what makes you feel
like we're worthy now?

1046
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,083
Shit. Look, I didn't mean
that you're not...

1047
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:17,601
Amanda, I'm sorry,

1048
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:19,688
but my feelings about this
still haven't changed.

1049
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,366
-Yeah.
-I thought we'd already...

1050
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,890
<i>The fire's crowning along Jericho Road,</i>

1051
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,889
running north. We're gonna get in front,

1052
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,122
try to box her off
and drive her toward the canyon.

1053
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:43,685
<i>Copy, Granite Mountain.</i>

1054

<i>We have</i> a <i>heavy air tanker
working in that</i> area.

1055
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,846
Assholes waited too long
to get a handle on this.

1056
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,050
All right, guys.
First order of business,

1057
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,565
I want to protect this structure,
and then we're gonna

1058
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,005
cut a line 30 feet off the road,
all right?

1059
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,771
Hey, we're flying solo on this one,
so let's stay on point.

1060
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:40,330
-Understood?
-You got it, Supe!

1061
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:44,685
Shit, he doesn't know we're here, man.

1062
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:46,364
Take cover! Take cover!

1063
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:58,761
Holy shit!

1064
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,282
So much for protecting that structure.

1065
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,724
-Y'all okay?
-Everyone all right? Yeah?

1066
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,848
-Fine.
-Yeah.

1067
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,005
All right, gear up.

1068
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,491
Get to work.

1069
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,888
Come on, let's go. Damn.

1070
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,325
I'm heading out!

1071
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:24,046
Why don't you have Marvel set up
the spare room for you?

1072
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,610
Drive home in the morning.

1073
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:28,208
Come on, it's a long drive
back to your place.

1074
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:30,727
Thanks, Duane. I can't.

1075
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,802
I got that big talk
at the ranch in the morning.

1076
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,370
So, got to go back and get ready.

1077
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:36,442
Yeah, I'm sending some people
over to listen.

1078
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:38,524
I'd appreciate that.

1079
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:40,450
Could use some new clients.

1080
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:42,649
You'll get 'em.

1081
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,886
All we're doing
is lacing together this fuel.

1082
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:50,245
Just slow strokes, back and forth.

1083
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,285
Wide spread.

1084
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,125
-Got it?
-Yeah.

1085
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,406
-You sure? All right.
-Yeah.

1086
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,688
I'll light you up.

1087
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,842
Our last chain, all right?

1088
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,644
I'll be up the slope.

1089
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:16,570
Hey, Supe! My torch!

1090
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:18,290
Shit.

1091
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:21,885
-What happened?
-Hey, Supe?

1092
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,325
I just tossed it. It was freaking out.

1093
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:24,401
It's all right. It was a bad mix.

1094
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,085
Steed, we're on our way out!

1095
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,241
Hold off on the burners!

1096
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:28,401
<i>Copy that.</i>

1097
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,289
Come on!

1098
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,684
Come on.

1099
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:17,283
-Holy shit!
-Yeah!

1100
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,408
-That's an 8.5.
-No way.

1101
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:20,646
The last one was better.

1102
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,443
Here she comes.

1103
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,967
-Yeah!
-That's another one!

1104
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,969
-Shit!
-Hey.

1105
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:33,410
Hey, Supe, I just want to thank you
for pulling me out earlier.

1106
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,005
It was definitely
an ass-puckerer, wasn't it?

1107
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,127
No doubt, man. I thought I was done.

1108
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:40,690
If this ain't the greatest job
in the world,

1109
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:43,525
-I don't know what is.
-You got that right, Supe.

1110
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:46,129
Wait for it. Wait for it.

1111
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,250
-That's a 10!
-Yeah!

1112
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:54,441
That's a 10.

1113
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,770
All right, thanks for the ride.

1114
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,568
You need anything, give me a call.

1115
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:31,886
Yeah.

1116
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:33,241
All right.

1117
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,282
Confining a horse to a stall

1118
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:50,563
or a small paddock inhibits blood flow,

1119
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,086
and it damages receptors
in the hoof capsule.

1120
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,924
Horses are designed for movement.

1121
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:02,846
Depending on the damage,

1122
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:06,129
I recommend a two-to-three-month
transition period.

1123
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,922
-Thanks for coming!
-Later!

1124
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:16,248
Why didn't you call me?

1125
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,249
Why do I have to find out from Duane,

1126
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,322
who found out from a goddamn EMT?

1127
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,250
Thought you were out on the line.

1128
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,403
Didn't want to worry you.

1129
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,728
- And I was fine. I am fine.
- You're not...

1130
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:29,049
Look at your face, your wrist.

1131
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:30,605
-Look at the damn truck!
-No, no, no!

1132
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:31,966
Wait a minute!

1133
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,447
You don't get to do this, okay?

1134
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:37,291
I've had to learn how to live
my life without needing you,

1135
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,567
and now you're pissed
at me because of it?

1136
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:43,091
Screw that!
You don't get to have it both ways!

1137
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:50,531
Hey, sweetie, come here.

1138
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,402
Oh, no.

1139
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,044
It's okay.

1140
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:00,526
Daddy can't get a kiss from you? No?

1141
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,849
Brendan, she's barely seen you
for the past few months.

1142
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,690
Yeah, I know.
It's been a really tough season,

1143
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:11,247
and I'm, like, doing the best I can.
You know?

1144
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,050
I know, but she doesn't understand that.

1145
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:14,645
You're doing great.

1146
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:17,730
Young kids just need consistency.

1147
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:24,044
Yay!

1148
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:27,204
-Who's a big girl?
-Yeah, she is.

1149
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:33,443
-Look at you. What?
-What is that?

1150
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,961
All right, we got a new start-up

1151
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,724
by Granite Mountain.

1152
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,165
We're looking at the Doce Fire.

1153
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:41,208
Started up 8 miles southwest of town.

1154
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,850
-Kicked up big last night.
-How big?

1155
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,850
Over 1,000 acres burned already.

1156
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,684
Burned through dry brush
straight towards town.

1157
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,569
We got a Red Flag Warning in effect,

1158
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:50,046
40-mile-per-hour wind gusts

1159
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:52,964
and a relative humidity as low as 3%.

1160
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,565
- A real ass-kicker.
- Hell, yeah.

1161
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,122
Two days off, right back at it, boys.

1162
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:59,004
Hey, guys, listen up.

1163
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,171
The state has ordered a management team.

1164
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:04,408
IC has asked me to head up
Division Bravo,

1165
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:07,165
so Steed is your supe on this next one.

1166
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,329
Nice one. Yeah, Steed!

1167
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,482
We got six hotshot crews coming in.

1168
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:13,285
What's our deal?

1169
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,647
Well, no one knows this area
better than we do,

1170
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:19,202
and that's why I'm giving
you guys a special assignment.

1171
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:27,041
<i>Fire's threatening Prescott,</i>

1172
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:29,209
and we get stuck on
some chicken-shit detail

1173
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,044
-to protect a tree?
- It's lame, man.

1174
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:34,090
Lame-ass tree is a national treasure.
It's over 2,000 years old.

1175
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:36,527
But more importantly,
that tree is on our line.

1176
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:39,126
If the fire gets past our line,
it goes to our town.

1177
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:40,924
Quit your bitching, Turby.

1178
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,764
All right, well,
now I feel like an asshole.

1179
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:43,921
You are.

1180
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,451
Damn.

1181
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,090
-Now, that's a tree.
-That's something.

1182
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:57,969
That is definitely a tree.

1183
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,765
I thought it was gonna be bigger.

1184
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:06,445
All right.

1185
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:08,284
Let's prep 30 feet around her
and burn her off.

1186
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,885
-All right.
-Come on, let's go to work!

1187
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:11,007
Let's go, Alpha!

1188
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,089
-All right, let's move!
-That's right, Donut.

1189
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,321
Next tree, let's go.

1190
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,648
Hey, Donut, grab this other tree.

1191
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,250
National treasure.

1192
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:29,085
Take more, guys.

1193
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:30,685
-Take more.
-Good job, Bravo.

1194
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,205
Hey, tie it in and let's go.

1195
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:33,850
Keep the line tight, move.

1196
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,129
This is our front door
she's knocking on.

1197
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,406
-Come on, move.
-Yeah, let's go.

1198
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:41,289
Let's get this nice, man.

1199
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,085
Here she comes.

1200
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:35,531
Spot fire! One scrape!

1201
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,251
He)’, We got a spot!

1202
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,845
I need two! Let's go!

1203
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:06,281
Now that's what I call a line!

1204
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,284
All right, guys, let's mop it up!

1205
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:10,364
All right, Alpha! Get it on!

1206
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:11,925
-Let's go!
-Nice work!

1207
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,126
-You heard him!
-Nice.

1208
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,201
Little Woyjeck!

1209
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:15,406
Bravo, let's go, with me!

1210
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:17,010
That's you, bro.
Hey, nice work, nice work.

1211
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:18,445
-Let's get something to drink.
-Bottoms up.

1212
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,010
Move up the hill and mop it up up here.

1213
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,525
Alpha boys, let's go!

1214
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,807
-Here we go.
-Ready?

1215
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,885
Hey, you're stepping on my asshole.

1216
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,849
-Come on.
-Tight.

1217
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:33,721
Granite Mountain on two.

1218
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:35,086
One, two...

1219
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,089
Granite Mountain!

1220
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,048
Hey, man, how are things
with our little girl?

1221
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,406
It's rough, man.

1222
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:49,131
I mean, when we came back
from that last fire,

1223
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,804
it's like she didn't even recognize me.

1224
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:54,043
But Steed and Turby
seem to have it figured out.

1225
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:57,206
You know, whatever that is,
I want a piece of it.

1226
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:01,050
Dude!

1227
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,724
-Shit.
-What?

1228
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:04,610
Dude.

1229
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:06,405
That's a rattler.

1230
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,960
No way did that just happen, man.

1231
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:11,050
Where was your crew
working when you got bit?

1232
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:14,448
We were cutting line around an
old tree near Granite Mountain.

1233
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,927
-The big juniper?
-Yes, ma'am.

1234
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,848
My husband proposed to me
under that tree.

1235
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,287
- Describe the pain, one to 10.
- It's pretty bad.

1236
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:23,805
It's, like, moving up my leg right now.

1237
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:26,287
So, Brendan, we're gonna
move you to another bed here.

1238
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:30,042
Gonna need you just to relax,
let us do the lifting, okay?

1239
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:36,410
Sir, I'm sorry, who are you?

1240
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:39,888
I'm Eric Marsh,
Granite Mountain Superintendent.

1241
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,451
Hey, Donut, how you doing?

1242
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:44,410
I don't know. Ask them.

1243
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:46,484
Vitals look good, stable.

1244
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:47,766
You give him antivenom?

1245
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,683
-No, and I'd rather not.
-Why?

1246
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:52,566
I would like to save that bullet
for when you really need it.

1247
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,762
Antibiotics and a morphine drip
will do the trick.

1248
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,923
No, I don't want any morphine.

1249
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:58,764
No painkillers, either.

1250
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:00,650
The ride's gonna be
a lot rougher without them.

1251
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:02,802
-Are you sure about that?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

1252
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:08,569
Hey, Donut, what's your fifth watch-out?

1253
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:13,130
Uninformed on strategy, tactics
and hazards.

1254
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:15,049
There it is.

1255
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,485
You're gonna be fine.

1256
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:18,728
I got to get back to ICP, okay?

1257
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,968
I'll see you on the other side.
Hang in there.

1258
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:23,566
Don't you worry about your boy.
We'll take good care of him.

1259
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:27,369
You all are heroes.

1260
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,051
Hang in there.

1261
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,405
See you, Supe.

1262
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:42,846
Mack.

1263
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:53,050
Bro.

1264
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,326
Yeah, man.

1265
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:56,728
You got to go.

1266
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:00,930
You smell like shit
and you keep snoring so loud.

1267
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,684
-Am I?
-Yeah.

1268
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,842
Yeah. Are you good?

1269
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,126
Yeah, I'm good.

-Okay.
-Yeah.

I mean, I love you,
but you also smell pretty bad.

01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:16,609
- I'm glad you're good, bro.
- Yeah.

1274

I appreciate you coming.

1275

Shit.

A little keepsake right there, man.

Dude!

1279

We hunted that bastard
for 45 minutes, bro.

1280
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:31,811
That's good luck.

1281
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,450

- Yeah, it's good luck.

-It is.
-You take it, then.

1283

Okay, really?

1284
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:40,489
I mean, you can't let a brother get bit

1285
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:42,125
and let him tell the story, you know?

1286
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:43,805
Nora, this is...

1287

-This is my good buddy, Mack.
-Hi.

-How you doing? Pleasure.
-Nice to meet you.

You, too.

1290
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,210
Hey, okay, you need to put that away

1291
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,765
'cause your family's here.

1292
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,530
Okay.

1293

-That's your nurse?
-Yeah.

1294
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:06,169
Dude, she's actually, like,
really cool and smart.

1295
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:08,049
- Really?
- Yeah, went to college somewhere good.

1296
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:10,288
-What?
-I know. I picked her for you.

1297
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,727
-Thank you.
-I know your type.

-Hi. How are you?
-Good.

1302
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,324
-Sweetie.
-Look who's here.

1303
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:23,811
Thought you could use some huggies.

1304
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:25,120
-And some kissies.
-I could.

1305

-I missed you so much.
-How you feeling?

I'm feeling all right.

1309
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:36,727
-Yeah, he's gonna be okay.
-What'd she say?

1310
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,240
I think she's hungry.

1311
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,810
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1312
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:41,803
We'll go get a bite,
and then we'll come back.

1313

Okay. All right, I'll be here.

-Bye.
-Yeah. See you in a few.

1316

-Yeah. Right now?
-Yeah.

No, man, I just wanted to...

1395
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:43,124
You know, I wanted
to talk to you for a sec.

What? About what?

1397

Well, I wanted to thank you

for everything that you've done.

1399
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,850
I didn't do anything. All good.

1400
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:53,242
No, you took a big chance on me.
I know that.

1401

The world's full of people
taking chances, Donut.

1402
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:00,247
Jesus, Supe, why can't you
just say, "You're welcome"?

1403
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:03,245
'Cause I'm uncomfortable with gratitude.

1404
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:04,606
I don't like it.

1405
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:06,444
All right, well, too bad.

1406
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:08,409
That's what this is, gratitude.

1407
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:10,010
Okay. All right.

1408
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:11,764
I can live with that, I guess.

1409
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,407
Oh, God.

1410
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,001
So, we good?

01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:19,131
There's something else I do
want to talk to you about.

1412
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:22,529
I've been doing a lot of thinking,

1413
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:25,001
and after this fire season's over,

1414
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:27,560
I want to move over
to the structure side.

1415
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:29,688
And I was hoping maybe

1416
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:32,491
that you could put in a good word
with Chief Ellis for me.

1417
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:33,766
Okay.

1418
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:36,203
All right.

1419
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,361
All right, let me just
see if I got this down.

1420
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:43,246
So, you brought me out here to thank me

1421
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:45,209
for giving you a chance that nobody

1422
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:48,124
on the face of the fucking
Earth would give you,

1423
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,726
and your way of showing appreciation is

1424
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:53,406
to then say to me that, what,

1425
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:55,721
you're gonna quit on me and this crew?

1426
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:12,204
Look, Supe, I'm having a hard time.

1427
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:14,601
It's tough.

1428
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:17,246
I'm having a hard time being
a good dad and doing this job.

1429
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:18,924
Okay, everybody's having a hard time

1430
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:21,327
because most of the men
on this crew have families.

1431
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:23,084
And I don't hear any of them
bitching, do you?

1432
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:24,969
Yeah, look, I can't speak to that, okay?

1433
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:26,565
-I don't know. I...
-No, you can't.

1434
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:27,880
I didn't have a dad growing up.

1435
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:29,570
He wasn't around for me, so when...

1436
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:31,290
I'm not gonna do that
to my daughter, man.

1437
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:32,771
-That's it.
-So what?

1438
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:36,527
So what, Donut?

1439
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:38,444
I mean, do you think anyone's gonna hire

1440
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,210
a cheese-dick like you
on the structure side,

1441
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:42,601
an asshole with a record and a rep?

1442
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:45,240
That's just never gonna happen.

1443
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,170
And then what?

1444
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:49,249
You're gonna be
washing dishes, miserable?

1445
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:51,044
How long you think
you're gonna stay clean then?

1446
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:54,290
Now, listen to me. Listen.

1447
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,643
If you quit this crew,

1448
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:02,811
you're gonna either end up dead
or behind bars.

1449
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,691
Hey, come on, let's go. Come on.

1450
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:28,810
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1451
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:52,884
-Happens all the time.
-Yeah.

1452
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,731
Guys are always leaving crews
because of family.

1453
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,040
Right.

1454
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:59,009
So, why are you so pissed at this kid?

1455
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:02,400
'Cause a year ago he was a junkie,
tonight he's a hero.

1456
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:05,961
I mean, come on,
this job saved his life,

1457
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:08,168
and now he'll probably end up
right back where he started.

1458
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:09,605
Well, if you think
that he might relapse,

1459
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:11,887
maybe you should take him
to a meeting with you.

1460
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,130
Does he even know
that you go to meetings?

1461
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:15,645
It's nobody's business but my own.

1462
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:16,801
Okay, so you're pissed 'cause you think

1463
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:18,723
he owes the job something more
than his own daughter.

1464
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:20,643
- I didn't say that.
- Maybe it's 'cause he made

1465
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,723
the choice that you're avoiding.

1466
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,567
His thing has nothing
to do with me, okay?

1467
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:26,766
I think it's got
everything to do with it.

1468
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,609
No, no. I don't...
I don't want to do this.

1469
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:30,682
Well, you know what?
You've had one day off

1470
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:32,489
in the last month,
which you spent sleeping,

1471
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:35,001
so when are we supposed to do it?

1472
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:39,931
What? What?

1473
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,286
I'll tell you what!

1474
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:44,081
You live your life in a glass box

1475
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:47,004
with a sign that says,
"Break in case of fire"!

1476
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:49,851
You are 90% hotshot, you are 10% mine,

1477
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:51,450
and that is not enough!

1478
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:53,244
What is that? ls that an ultimatum?
ls that what that...

1479
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:55,408
No, I'm telling you how I feel,
and that's different.

1480
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:57,323
I want a family
with the man that I love.

1481
01:31:57,480 --> 01:32:00,245
You knew exactly what the deal was
when we got into this, okay?

1482
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:01,526
I've been straight with you...

1483
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:02,840
Yeah, fine. I don't give a shit!

1484
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,246
From the first day that we met!

1485
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:05,526
We were in the same place then!

1486
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:07,250
That was six years ago,

1487
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:10,244
and people are supposed to be
changed by their relationships!

1488
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:12,966
That's what happened to me!

1489
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:15,084
I let you in!

1490
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:17,410
I've been changed by you!

1491
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:19,564
I'm a different person!

1492
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:23,088
I have moved on from my addiction,
and you are still

1493
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:26,607
fucking feeding yours
with another kind of drug!

1494
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:34,491
Where are you going?

1495
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:35,880
For a walk!

1496
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:59,650
I didn't know who else to call.

1497
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:01,444
Sit down.

1498
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:15,170
Do you know where I'm at right now?

1499
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:17,606
Yeah.

1500
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:20,649
I've been there.

1501
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:25,440
I don't know what to do.

1502
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:26,885
Yeah, well,

1503
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:30,322
you got to ask yourself,

1504
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:36,289
"What can I live with
and what can I die without?"

1505
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,889
You know what I mean?

1506
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:41,289
No, I don't.

1507
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:45,521
Yeah.

1508
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,770
I don't know.

1509
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:53,607
You know, when I was a Globe Hotshot...

1510
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:56,246
Maybe 26, 27...

1511
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:01,162
I worked this blaze
near Big Timber, Montana.

1512
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:05,731
It was night, and
she just wasn't laying down.

1513
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:08,770
Conditions going from mean to wicked.

1514
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:11,049
And me and my crew pulled back
into the black

1515
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:14,010
of this wide-open grassland

1516
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:16,447
set right at the foot
of this sprawling forest,

1517
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:19,330
just a few thousand acres
of tall, dense pine,

1518
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:22,131
all of it green and packed with resin.

1519
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,971
And all of a sudden,

1520
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:32,201
this savage wind kicked up,

1521
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:38,406
and it carried with it this
tidal wave of brands and fire,

1522
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:41,051
just sweeping through the trees.

1523
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:44,408
And just in the blink
of an eye, the whole stretch

1524
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:49,166
turned into a blast furnace,
just fire everywhere.

1525
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:52,931
And then,

1526
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:57,047
charging out of these flames,

1527
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:01,051
all of a sudden comes this bear.

1528
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:04,766
And the bear's on fire.

1529
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:07,448
And he's running.

1530
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:10,888
And he just barrels right past us,

1531
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:14,721
and keeps running,

1532
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:17,041
hard-charging into the darkness.

1533
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:20,929
That bear on fire

1534
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:27,484
was the most beautiful and
terrible thing I've ever seen.

1535
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:36,564
I'm feeling a lot like
that bear right now, Duane.

1536
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:23,322
I'm yours.

1537
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,443
I'm yours, Manda-bear.

1538
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:50,962
Yeah, this is Marsh.

1539
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:54,921
Okay.

1540
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,211
Hey, Jesse.

1541
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:04,681
We got a new start down in Yarnell.
Lightning strike.

1542
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:06,850
Yeah, go ahead, ring the bell.

1543
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:09,163
We'll see you in a few.

1544
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:11,845
What's up?

1545
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:14,247
A skunker down in Yarnell.

1546
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:16,682
It's no big deal.

1547
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:18,841
Kiss.

1548
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:22,165
Yes, ma'am.

1549
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:33,402
I love you, Shortstop.

1550
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:35,170
You, too, Sugariits.

1551
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:39,041
Go back to sleep.

1552
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:41,282
I'll probably be home for dinner.

1553
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:06,570
Not a skunker anymore, Supe.
She's moving fast.

1554
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:12,684
Jesse, this is gonna be
my last year as supe.

1555
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,562
The job is yours if you want it.

1556
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:26,242
Fire's threatening homes
in Peeples Valley,

1557
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,448
so we've ordered
three more hotshot crews.

1558
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:30,204
In the meantime, I want Granite Mountain

1559
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:33,204
to set an anchor here on
the southwest heel of the fire.

1560
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:35,926
Keep it from running at Yarnell
if the weather shifts.

1561
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,331
Now, there's a safety zone here

1562
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:41,611
at Boulder Springs Ranch, fireproof,
built of nonflammables.

1563
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:43,170
The vegetation's been cleared.

1564
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,286
-Ferguson?
-Yeah.

1565
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:47,688
You and Blue River will cut here,

1566
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:50,001
east of Marsh's crew,
and your fallback will be

1567
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:51,241
this two-track road.

1568
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:54,491
We've established three trigger points.

1569
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:56,881
First trigger for Yarnell evac
should take an hour.

1570
01:38:57,440 --> 01:39:00,330
Second trigger, all crews retreat.

1571
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:01,401
Third,

1572
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:05,048
no one should be near Yarnell, okay?

1573
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:22,010
-Come on, keep it tight!
-Tight!

1574
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:24,162
-Tight!
-Tight.

1575
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:26,283
'Tight!
'Tight!

1576
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:32,971
-Steeder.
-Yo.

1577
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:35,281
Tell me we're gonna be off this shit
and home by tomorrow night. Please.

1578
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:36,771
Hope so.

1579
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:38,524
-He's got a big date.
-Yeah? With who?

1580
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:40,762
That barely legal hottie from the party?

1581
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:42,763
That right? She got a sister?

1582
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:46,050
Look, guys, back off.
He met a girl that he really likes.

1583
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:49,044
-No way. Who?
-One of the nurses who took care of me.

1584
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:52,847
She's, like, 27, gives a great IV.

1585
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,610
She's nice.

1586
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:56,603
-So, you closed?
-Like I said, brother.

1587
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:58,046
Not like that.

1588
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:00,528
What, is she playing hard to get?

1589
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:02,608
-More like hard to forget.
-That's, like,

1590
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:05,001
the cutest thing I ever
heard you say, man.

1591
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:06,161
I know, dude.

1592
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:09,329
This girl scares the shit out of me.

1593
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:11,522
That's good, brother.

1594
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:13,568
-That's how you know it's real.
-Shit.

1595
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:15,525
Hey, hold up.

Not even 10:00 a.m., 105 and climbing.

Embrace the suck.

1601
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:37,370
Operations, this is Granite Mountain.

1602
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,841
We got clouds forming
above Peeples Valley.

1603
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:42,765
They start to grow, the fire's gonna get
a lot worse real quick.

1604
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,530
Our line's ready to burn right now.

I'm sorry about last night.

Now, I don't know how to explain,
but sometimes we...

1620

We don't see things as they are.

1621
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:35,847
You know, we see them as we are.

1622
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:37,606
You understand that?

1623
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:40,081
Yeah. Think so.

1624
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:41,930
What happened wasn't about you.

1625
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:44,610
It was about me.

1626
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:50,081
I was you.

1627
01:41:54,680 --> 01:42:00,084
I will help you out in anyway I can,
so long as you walk the line.

01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,162
Thanks, Supe.

1630

After we burn this off,
we head back down, boys.

Hey, Supe, none of this shit's
gonna light off now.

1643

What's your move?

1644
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:01,404
All right, tie it off here.

01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:03,927
Take the line all the way up the ridge.

How's that leg, buddy?

1648

Yeah.

Good spot right over there.

Just make sure you got
your weather kit handy.

1652

You got it, Supe.

1654
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:26,170
Heard you on the TAC channel.

-You moving the line?
-Yeah, next hill over.

We're moving to a secondary line,
but we'll adjust to you.

1658
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:36,561
You mind taking my lookout,
Donut here, give him a lift?

1659
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,848
No. Hop on.

-All right.
-See you later.

1680
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:39,086
Fire's picking up, and it's
moving towards my location.

1681

Okay, time for you
to get out of there, Donut.

1682
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:47,166
It just hit the ridge.

1683
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:48,446

I mean it, Jesse,
I don't want to stand around

1740
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:56,401
like a worthless piece of shit
while this town burns.

1741
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:58,482
Easy, brother.

1742
01:48:58,760 --> 01:49:00,410
None of us do.

1743
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:03,926
Steeder.

1744
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,843
What's the plan here?

1745
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:14,209
Well,

1746
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:18,202
they're not doing anything to
slow you down at all, are they?

1747
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:26,244
Air Attack, Granite Mountain.
What's the status on the air tankers?

1748
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:30,010
<i>Granite Mountain,
air tankers have been delayed.</i>

1749
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:31,684
<i>We got homes burning in Yarnell,</i>

1750
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:33,968
<i>and base camp's being pushed.</i>

1751
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:43,725
Jesse, I think we should move on

1752
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:46,007
to our escape route,
head down to the ranch

1753
01:49:46,240 --> 01:49:47,924
<i>and work the ﬁre from there.</i>

1754
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:49,849
<i>We're the only crew in position
to save these homes.</i>

1755
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,651
You and the boys down
for getting back in the game?

1756
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:56,291
You guys hear that?

1757
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:58,768
-Let's go to work, Supe.
-All right, back to work, boys.

1758
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,570
-Back to work.
-Come on, man,

1759
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:02,808
-this is what we were born to do.
-Let's break a sweat, boys.

1760
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:04,526
Let's get it!

1761
01:50:07,480 --> 01:50:08,970
-What?
-Let's put this bad boy out.

1762
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:12,646
Let's go, Ashcraft!

1763

Ops, Granite Mountain.

1764
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:17,131
I want to pass on that we're gonna
make our way toward our escape route.

1765
01:50:17,560 --> 01:50:19,005
<i>You guys are in the black, correct?</i>

1766
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:21,044
Yep. We're gonna pick our way
through the black,

1767
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:22,531
and then on toward the ranch.

1768
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:24,125
<i>Copy that.</i>

1769
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:30,411
<i>Donut, fire just hit
trigger point two. We're pulling back</i>

1770

-to the restaurant.
-Copy, Blue River.

1771

Ops, Granite Mountain.

1772
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:53,646
We're going down our escape route
to our safety zone.

1773
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:55,081
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

1774
01:50:57,760 --> 01:50:59,000
Yeah.

1775
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:01,209
-We're just moving.
-Copy.

1776
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:24,688
Steed, you with me?

1777
01:51:25,160 --> 01:51:27,561
Yeah, we're with you. Coming off
the black and into the canyon.

1778
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:30,365
<i>I'm almost at the ranch. Looks good.</i>

1779
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:32,448
<i>Be able to reengage the ﬁre from there.</i>

1780
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:36,966
All right, guys.
Keep the pace and watch your footing.

1781
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:38,246
Watch your footing.

1782
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:41,011
-Watch your footing.
-Watch your footing.

1783

You, too. Let's go.

1785
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:56,606
-Hey, how can I help?
-Just wait here with my crew.

1786
01:51:56,680 --> 01:51:58,523
I'm gonna check in
with Operations to get orders.

1787
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:00,723
All right.
Hey, thanks for picking me up.

1788
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:03,167
-I owe you one.
-Just sit tight, all right?

1789

<i>Air Attack, Operations.</i>

Prepare deployment site right here. Now!

We can't go back up there.

There's no time, Jesse.

1799

Breaking in on Arizona 16!
