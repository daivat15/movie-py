1
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:46,917
The crew's crossing gantry for capsule ingress.

2
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,548
Roger that.

3
00:00:49,248 --> 00:00:51,625
Inspired by the late President Kennedy...

4
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:56,633
in only seven years, America has risen
to the challenge of what he called:

5
00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:00,493
"The most hazardous and dangerous
and greatest adventure...

6
00:01:00,626 --> 00:01:03,072
"on which man has ever embarked."

7
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,743
After trailing the Russians for years
with our manned space program...

8
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,746
and after that sudden and horrible fire...

9
00:01:10,803 --> 00:01:13,215
on the launch pad during a routine test...

10
00:01:13,272 --> 00:01:16,082
that killed American astronauts Gus Grissom...

11
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:18,485
Ed White and Roger Chaffee...

12
00:01:18,577 --> 00:01:22,217
there were serious doubts that
we could beat the Russians to the moon.

13
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:26,320
But tonight, a mere 18 months
after the tragedy of Apollo 1...

14
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:30,458
the entire world watched in awe
as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin...

15
00:01:30,556 --> 00:01:32,126
landed on the moon.

16
00:01:32,224 --> 00:01:34,761
The big news came just a moment ago.

17
00:01:34,827 --> 00:01:37,807
Mission Control gave the spacecraft permission...

18
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:40,741
to go for the extravehicular activity...

19
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,745
that is, for the walk on the moon...

20
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:47,478
far earlier than anticipated,
9:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time...

21
00:01:47,673 --> 00:01:51,586
The important thing when you penetrate
the lunar module is your attitude...

22
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,120
and relative speed.

23
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,749
Let's say this is me here
in the command module and this is you...

24
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,420
- All right.
- In the LEM.

25
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:00,657
This thing sticking out here is called the probe.

26
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,732
- Ls that true?
- Absolutely.

27
00:02:03,155 --> 00:02:07,398
Tracey, when you feel that thing slide in,
everything's clicking...

28
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:10,330
it's like no other feeling in the world.

29
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:14,369
- A little liquid propulsion.
- What's the big occasion?

30
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:16,435
How's it going at Mission Control?

31
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,242
It's a nervous time.
They're pacing around and smoking.

32
00:02:19,338 --> 00:02:21,750
Gene Kranz is gonna have puppies. Jim Lovell.

33
00:02:22,007 --> 00:02:23,042
This is Tracey.

34
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,020
- How do you do, Tracey?
- This is the man.

35
00:02:25,077 --> 00:02:28,547
Gemini 7 . Gemini 12. Apollo 8.
They were the first around the moon.

36
00:02:28,614 --> 00:02:30,115
This guy did 10 laps.

37
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:33,255
With one hand on the wheel.
Make yourselves at home.

38
00:02:34,887 --> 00:02:37,458
This is the last champagne
in the city of Houston.

39
00:02:37,556 --> 00:02:39,592
- Very good.
- Everything else all right?

40
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:42,297
- Everything's on course.
- Looks okay. Cadet Lovell.

41
00:02:42,394 --> 00:02:45,204
- Hey, Dad.
- Put this on ice. Make sure it gets cold.

42
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:48,301
- You gonna get a haircut this week?
- I'm on vacation.

43
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:51,037
Get a haircut.

44
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:03,650
- I wouldn't mind being up there tonight.
- God, who wouldn't.

45
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:06,126
Don't worry. Our day's coming.

46
00:03:06,852 --> 00:03:09,855
They're not gonna cut the program
before number 14.

47
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:12,329
You know, my cousin called.

48
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:15,562
Asked who we bribed to get on Jim Lovell's crew.

49
00:03:15,661 --> 00:03:19,131
I told him they wanted
to make sure he got the best.

50
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:21,333
Well, they got that right.

51
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,844
What network do we want?

52
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:25,672
Put on Walter!

53
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,239
Jules Bergman!

54
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:28,749
John, turn it up!

55
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:36,116
I really appreciate...

56
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:40,323
you all coming to this dress rehearsal party
for my Apollo 12 landing.

57
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,024
Sit down, Conrad.

58
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:45,033
I think we should all take
a moment to recognize...

59
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,830
the exemplary...

60
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:49,872
hell, damn near heroic effort...

61
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:54,239
displayed by Neil Armstrong's backup
for this historic moon walk...

62
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,709
and, of course, his crew.

63
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:59,181
Let's hear it for Jim Lovell,
Ken Mattingly and Fred Haise.

64
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,450
There he is! Everybody quiet down!

65
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:10,255
Hey! Kids!

66
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,056
You got a good picture?

67
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:18,257
We can verify the position of the opening
I ought to have on the camera.

68
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:26,139
- You think it's too late for him to abort?
- He still has time to get out.

69
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:28,974
- He just needs somebody to wave him off.
- Pull up, Neil!

70
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:30,342
Pull up!

71
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,282
Neil, we can see you coming down the ladder now.

72
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,344
Look at those pictures.

73
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,221
I'm at the foot of the ladder.

74
00:04:41,513 --> 00:04:45,791
The LEM footpads
are only depressed in the surtace about...

75
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,256
one or two inches.

76
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,890
It's almost like a powder.

77
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:51,866
Armstrong ls on the moon.

78
00:04:51,957 --> 00:04:55,404
Neil Armstrong, 38-year-old American...

79
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:58,536
standing on the surtace of the moon...

80
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:03,039
on this July 20, 1969.

81
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,514
That's one small step for man...

82
00:05:07,873 --> 00:05:10,512
one giant leap for mankind.

83
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:17,885
"That's one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind."

84
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:34,733
You're drunk, Lovell.

85
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:37,971
I'm not used to the champagne.

86
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,680
Me, neither.

87
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:46,049
I can't deal with cleaning up.
Let's sell the house.

88
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,523
All right, let's sell the house.

89
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:52,891
They're back inside now looking up at us.

90
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:54,594
Isn't that something?

91
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:59,164
I bet Jannie Armstrong
doesn't get a wink of sleep tonight.

92
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:03,767
When you were on the far side on 8,
I didn't sleep at all.

93
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:06,468
I just vacuumed over and over again.

94
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:10,774
Christopher Columbus,
Charles Lindbergh, and Neil Armstrong.

95
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:15,509
Neil Armstrong.

96
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:30,127
From now on, we live in a world
where man has walked on the moon.

97
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,467
It's not a miracle.

98
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:38,039
We just decided to go.

99
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,504
On Apollo 8, we were so close...

100
00:06:42,134 --> 00:06:44,671
just 60 nautical miles down and...

101
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,180
it was as if I could just...

102
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,682
step out and walk on the face of it.

103
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:01,455
I want to go back there.

104
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,970
Where's my mountain?

105
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:15,539
It's right up by the...

106
00:07:16,468 --> 00:07:19,210
Do you see where the shadow crosses...

107
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,748
the white area there?
That's the Sea of Tranquillity...

108
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:25,114
and your mountain's on the edge of that.

109
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,986
It's your mountain, Marilyn. Mount Marilyn.

110
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,618
I don't see it.

111
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:35,626
Well, you gotta look harder.

112
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,565
You look harder...

113
00:07:42,828 --> 00:07:44,136
while l...

114
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:59,251
The astronaut is the most
visible member of a very large team.

115
00:07:59,611 --> 00:08:02,523
All of us, down to the guy sweeping the floor...

116
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:04,321
are honored to be a part of it.

117
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:08,192
What did the man say? "Give me a lever
long enough and I'll move the world"?

118
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:12,030
That's what we're doing here.
This is divine inspiration, folks.

119
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:16,004
It's the best part of each one of us,
the belief that anything is possible.

120
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:20,374
Things like a computer
that can fit into a single room...

121
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:23,869
and hold millions of pieces of information...

122
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,208
or the Saturn 5 rocket.

123
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:29,842
This is the actual launch vehicle
that will be taking Alan Shepard...

124
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:33,878
and his crew on the first leg
of the Apollo 13 mission.

125
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,682
When are you going up again, Jim?

126
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:41,420
I'm slated to be the commander
of Apollo 14 sometime late next year.

127
00:08:42,387 --> 00:08:44,457
If there is an Apollo 14.

128
00:08:47,092 --> 00:08:50,368
People in my state have been asking
why we're continuing...

129
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:54,138
to fund this program now that we've
beaten the Russians to the moon.

130
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:57,578
Imagine if Christopher Columbus
had come back from the New World...

131
00:08:57,636 --> 00:08:59,638
and no one returned in his footsteps.

132
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:02,684
Attention, all personnel. Clear level 3.

133
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:06,513
Are there any other questions?

134
00:09:07,646 --> 00:09:10,183
How do you go to the bathroom in space?

135
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:12,819
It's a highly technical process...

136
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:17,197
of cranking down the window
and looking for a gas station which...

137
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,867
There's Deke Slayton.

138
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,536
You might be able to answer this lady's question.

139
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:27,372
Deke is one of the original
Marcury 7 astronauts, ladies and gentlemen.

140
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:31,004
Now he's our boss. He hands out
the astronauts' flight assignments...

141
00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:34,140
so naturally we kick back
part of our salaries to Deke.

142
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:37,242
- How much this month?
- Can I have a minute? Something's come up.

143
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,911
Sure.

144
00:09:46,685 --> 00:09:50,257
- Anybody home?
- I'm not being a cheerleader, Mom!

145
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:52,232
You don't understand! I worked so hard!

146
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:54,098
Maybe I don't understand...

147
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,866
but you are not wearing that
out in this neighborhood.

148
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,568
She's not even wearing a bra!
You can see everything!

149
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:00,939
Shut up!

150
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:03,773
Hey, everybody. Marilyn, trick or treat.

151
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,849
You know that Easter vacation trip
we had planned for Acapulco?

152
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,185
I was thinking there might be
a slight change in destination.

153
00:10:12,477 --> 00:10:13,751
Really?

154
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,256
Maybe, say...

155
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:18,151
the moon.

156
00:10:20,485 --> 00:10:23,158
Al Shepard's ear infection has flared up...

157
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:27,270
and we've all been bumped up
to the prime crew of Apollo 13.

158
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:32,102
Straight to the head of the line
and the Fra Mauro Highlands.

159
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,541
Six months? You're moving up six months?

160
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,543
Dad, can I please wear this?

161
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,872
Sure.

162
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,041
No! Absolutely not.

163
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:47,953
They're not rushing things, are they?
You'll be ready in six months?

164
00:10:48,046 --> 00:10:51,959
We'll be ready. I wouldn't want
to be around Al Shepard tonight.

165
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:55,020
I gotta get over there
and get up to speed on this.

166
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:56,523
Go.

167
00:10:57,155 --> 00:10:59,396
I'm gonna walk on the moon, Marilyn.

168
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,799
I know. I can't believe it.

169
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:05,431
Naturally, it's 13. Why 13?

170
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,869
It comes after 12, hon.

171
00:11:10,969 --> 00:11:14,939
Apollo 13, you are go for pyro arm and docking.

172
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,785
All systems are nominal and on the line.

173
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:23,287
S-4B is stable, SLA panels are drifting free.

174
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:26,328
The drogue is clear. The docking target is clear.

175
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:32,101
I'm coming up on that now. Two, one, mark.

176
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:35,269
Seventy-five feet. We're coming up on docking.

177
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:39,331
Let's shut down some thrusters on them.
Let's see what he does.

178
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:42,634
Wait a minute.

179
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:45,142
I lost something here. I can't translate up.

180
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,080
Houston, we are drifting down and away.

181
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:51,253
- Wanna back off and take another run?
- No, I got it.

182
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,120
Let me just try and get it stable here.

183
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:58,959
I'm gonna reset the high gain.
I've got the target back in the reticle.

184
00:11:59,017 --> 00:12:01,394
Okay, we're stable. Recycle the valves.

185
00:12:01,486 --> 00:12:03,829
- Forty feet.
- They're all gray.

186
00:12:07,492 --> 00:12:08,732
Twenty.

187
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,372
Ten feet.

188
00:12:16,501 --> 00:12:18,378
- Capture.
- That's it!

189
00:12:18,603 --> 00:12:22,573
- That's it.
- Sweet move, Ken. Beautiful.

190
00:12:22,674 --> 00:12:26,087
- Gentlemen, that is the way we do that.
- Man, that woke me up.

191
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:30,349
Apollo 13 backup crew,
you're up in the simulator.

192
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,362
- Nice job, gentlemen.
- That's three hours of boredom...

193
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:36,592
followed by seven seconds of sheer terror.

194
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:40,133
Good job, guys.
You just won the Christmas turkey.

195
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:41,869
Nice try, Frank.

196
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:44,941
You really outfoxed them.

197
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,772
Yeah, but it wasn't perfect.
Used up too much fuel.

198
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:49,401
You're above the curve.

199
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:52,778
Not by much. Listen, guys, I wanna work it again.

200
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:58,716
We gotta be up with the dawn patrol
headed for Bethpage at 0700.

201
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,620
- Wheels up at 0700.
- Yeah, I know...

202
00:13:00,712 --> 00:13:03,385
but my rate of turn is still a little slow there.

203
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:06,155
I really think we should work it again.

204
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:09,631
- Let's get it right.
- Set it up again, Frank.

205
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,170
Ckay, 13 backup crew. It'll have to wait.

206
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,729
Prime crew's up for another run.

207
00:13:19,364 --> 00:13:21,810
Apollo 13, we show S-4B shutdown...

208
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,846
and all systems are nominal.

209
00:13:23,902 --> 00:13:26,075
Fred, set the S-band omni to B...

210
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:28,913
and when you get in the LEM, to forward.

211
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:31,051
Good shape over here.

212
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:34,880
Hey, we got a problem.

213
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,560
Cabin depress. Repeat, cabin depress.

214
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,992
- Ken, get your helmet on!
- I can't get it locked!

215
00:13:41,052 --> 00:13:44,590
Houston, something ripped
a big hole in us! We got rapid depress!

216
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,265
Oh, God!

217
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,800
I thought the stars would fall on you.

218
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,764
That's silly. Stars can't fall on us.

219
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:25,106
You're a smarter kid than I was.

220
00:14:25,363 --> 00:14:27,843
How long will it take you to get to the moon?

221
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,139
Four days.

222
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,579
But that's pretty fast.

223
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:35,879
See, this is the Saturn 4B booster...

224
00:14:35,974 --> 00:14:38,579
and it shoots us away from the Earth...

225
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:42,714
as fast as a bullet from a gun...

226
00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:47,687
until the moon's gravity
actually grabs us and pulls us...

227
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:52,259
into a circle around the moon...

228
00:14:52,357 --> 00:14:54,928
which is called an orbit. All right?

229
00:14:56,027 --> 00:14:59,007
Fred and I float down the tunnel
into the lunar module...

230
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,037
this spidery-looking guy.

231
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:05,069
Only holds two people,
and it's just for landing on the moon.

232
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:08,082
And I take the controls, steer it around...

233
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:10,141
and I fly it down...

234
00:15:10,308 --> 00:15:13,812
adjusting it here, the attitude there,
pitch, roll...

235
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:17,788
for a nice, soft landing on the moon.

236
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:21,562
Better than Neil Armstrong.
Way better than Pete Conrad.

237
00:15:27,058 --> 00:15:29,970
Did you know the astronauts in the fire?

238
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:36,039
Yeah. I knew the astronauts in the fire.
All of them.

239
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,041
Could that happen again?

240
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:46,321
Well, I'll tell you something about that fire.

241
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,551
A lot of things went wrong.

242
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:51,852
The door.

243
00:15:53,718 --> 00:15:57,927
It's called the hatch. They couldn't
get it open when they needed to get out.

244
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,866
That was one thing.

245
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,938
A lot of things went wrong in that fire.

246
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,278
Did they fix it?

247
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:12,471
Yes, absolutely. We fixed it.

248
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:15,111
It's not a problem anymore.

249
00:16:25,817 --> 00:16:28,820
I can't believe they still have you
doing public appearances.

250
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:33,199
Well, Henry Hurt was all over me.

251
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:37,062
With a training schedule this tight,
they shouldn't be asking.

252
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,539
It's the program, Marilyn. You know, it's NASA.

253
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:42,168
Hey, you're Jim Lovell, aren't you?

254
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:44,703
Hey! Lucky 13!

255
00:16:45,236 --> 00:16:46,578
Right on!

256
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,357
That's the second time it's done that.

257
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:10,128
I was looking
at the kids' school schedule coming up.

258
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,473
It's a very busy week.

259
00:17:14,132 --> 00:17:17,408
I'm thinking about not going to the launch.

260
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:25,284
The kids need me at home.

261
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:28,984
Marilyn, we've had these kids for a while now.

262
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:32,693
They've never kept you
from coming to the other launches.

263
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:35,127
But your mother just had this stroke.

264
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:36,494
Mom's fine.

265
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:39,000
It's not like I've never been to a launch.

266
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,502
The other wives have not done three.

267
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,100
I just don't think I can go through all that.

268
00:17:49,634 --> 00:17:52,444
I'll just be glad when this one's over.

269
00:17:55,173 --> 00:17:57,812
You're gonna miss a hell of a show.

270
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:08,855
Hey, guys. See you in a few weeks.

271
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,627
Take care. Bring us back a moon rock.

272
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:42,360
- The number 13 doesn't bother you?
- Only if it's a Friday.

273
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:47,125
Apollo 13, lifting off
at 1300 hours and 13 minutes...

274
00:18:47,225 --> 00:18:50,228
and entering the moon's gravity on April 13?

275
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:54,333
Ken Mattingly here has been doing
some scientific experiments...

276
00:18:54,432 --> 00:18:56,434
regarding that very phenomenon.

277
00:18:56,901 --> 00:18:59,677
Yes, well, I had a black cat...

278
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,682
walk over a broken mirror...

279
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,187
under the lunar module ladder.
It didn't seem to be a problem.

280
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:07,222
We're considering a letter we got...

281
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,520
which said we ought to take a pig with us
for good luck.

282
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:15,026
Does it bother you that the public
regards this flight as routine?

283
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:19,034
There's nothing routine about flying
to the moon. I can vouch for that.

284
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,068
I think that an astronaut's last mission...

285
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:27,837
his final flight is always very special.

286
00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:31,440
Why is this your last, Jim?

287
00:19:32,036 --> 00:19:35,016
I'm in command of the best ship...

288
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:38,076
with the best crew that anybody could ask for...

289
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:41,879
and I'll be walking in a place
where there's 400 degrees difference...

290
00:19:41,946 --> 00:19:44,221
between sunlight and shadow.

291
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,427
I can't imagine ever topping that.

292
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:57,562
We have that scheduled for 0900 hours tomorrow.

293
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,631
- That's not gonna work, Walter.
- Why?

294
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:03,768
Freddo and I are going over
the lunar surface experiments tomorrow...

295
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:08,078
and Ken's gonna be back in the simulator.
We're going over the flight plan tonight.

296
00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:11,916
Gonna pay a visit to this machine
after you're hard down.

297
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,490
Jim, we've got a problem.

298
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,149
We just got some blood work back from the lab.

299
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:19,922
Charlie Duke has the measles.

300
00:20:20,418 --> 00:20:22,454
So we need a new backup.

301
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:26,301
- You've all been exposed to it.
- I've had the measles.

302
00:20:26,357 --> 00:20:28,268
Ken Mattingly hasn't.

303
00:20:29,527 --> 00:20:33,202
You wanna break up my crew
two days before the launch...

304
00:20:33,531 --> 00:20:37,638
when we can predict each other's moves,
read the tone of each other's voices?

305
00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:40,182
Ken Mattingly will get seriously ill...

306
00:20:40,338 --> 00:20:44,217
precisely when you and Haise will be
ascending from the lunar surface.

307
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,049
That's a lousy time for a fever.

308
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:49,056
Jack Swigert has been out of the loop for weeks.

309
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,353
He's fully qualified to fly this mission.

310
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:55,294
He's a fine pilot, but when was the last time
he was in a simulator?

311
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,462
I'm sorry, Jim. I understand how you feel.

312
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,468
We can do one of two things.

313
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:03,436
We can either scrub Mattingly
and go with Swigert...

314
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:06,770
or we can bump all three of you
to a later mission.

315
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:14,247
I've trained for the Fra Mauro Highlands...

316
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,420
and this is flight surgeon horseshit, Deke!

317
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:23,189
Jim, if you hold out for Ken,
you will not be on Apollo 13.

318
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,158
It's your decision.

319
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,293
Let it ring.

320
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:33,495
Listen, I gotta take that.

321
00:21:33,591 --> 00:21:36,264
- Why?
- Because I'm on the backup crew...

322
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:40,138
and the backup crew has to set up
the guest list and book the hotel rooms.

323
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:48,481
Yes, sir.

324
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,314
I understand.

325
00:21:51,175 --> 00:21:52,779
Thank you, sir.

326
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,045
Damn.

327
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,282
Medical guys.

328
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:37,463
I had a feeling when they started doing
all the blood tests that...

329
00:22:41,392 --> 00:22:46,102
I mean, I know it's their ass
if I get sick up there, but, I mean... Jesus!

330
00:23:02,413 --> 00:23:04,916
Swigert, he'll be fine.

331
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,198
He's strong.

332
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:15,733
It'll be a hell of a mission. One for the books.

333
00:23:19,897 --> 00:23:23,469
You sure about this? Why don't I talk to Deke?

334
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,877
I'm sure we can work this out.

335
00:23:27,705 --> 00:23:29,411
This was my call.

336
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,222
Must've been a tough one.

337
00:23:47,892 --> 00:23:50,235
Look, I don't have the measles.

338
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:53,805
I'm not gonna get the measles.

339
00:23:58,403 --> 00:23:59,904
Ken, wait up.

340
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:07,848
Trajectory is holding steady.
We're right on the line.

341
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:12,256
We're into program 64 at .05 G...

342
00:24:12,316 --> 00:24:13,886
so we're feeling that gravity now.

343
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:17,728
Houston, we are at 400,000 feet
passing entry interface.

344
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,933
About to lose signal.

345
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:23,561
Re-entry data is nominal,
and we have radio blackout.

346
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:30,075
What's the story here?

347
00:24:30,768 --> 00:24:34,238
I got a corridor light.
We're coming in too shallow.

348
00:24:34,505 --> 00:24:36,348
I'm going to manual.

349
00:24:40,878 --> 00:24:43,688
- Houston, switching to SCS.
- Roger, 13.

350
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,784
Okay, we're at three Gs.

351
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:47,759
Five Gs.

352
00:24:49,787 --> 00:24:51,630
We're coming in too steep.

353
00:24:51,722 --> 00:24:54,964
I'm gonna stay in this roll
and see if I can pull us out.

354
00:24:55,226 --> 00:24:56,966
We're at eight Gs.

355
00:24:57,862 --> 00:24:59,033
Nine.

356
00:24:59,697 --> 00:25:00,732
Ten.

357
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,980
- We're at 12 Gs.
- 12 Gs. We're burning up.

358
00:25:07,872 --> 00:25:08,975
Damn it!

359
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:12,181
I gave them a false indicator light
at entry interface.

360
00:25:12,243 --> 00:25:14,382
Even Mattingly didn't get it the first time.

361
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:16,481
How are you feeling, Freddo?

362
00:25:17,014 --> 00:25:18,515
Charbroiled.

363
00:25:23,187 --> 00:25:24,597
What happened?

364
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,998
Came in too steep. We're dead.

365
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,167
No shit.

366
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,263
We were into program 67 there.

367
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,612
We're gonna do this again, obviously.

368
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,274
Give us a minute to get our switches reset.

369
00:25:41,405 --> 00:25:43,407
Jim, could we have a word?

370
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:47,521
Sure, Deke.

371
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:56,557
We're going to drop offline
and debrief this one on our own.

372
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:04,871
If I had a dollar every time
they killed me in this thing...

373
00:26:04,962 --> 00:26:07,806
I wouldn't have to work for you, Deke.

374
00:26:13,037 --> 00:26:15,813
Well, we have two days. We'll be ready.

375
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,814
Let's do it again.

376
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,054
Do it again.

377
00:26:31,522 --> 00:26:33,968
Get down, Fred! Stephen, come here!

378
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,234
We can't go across that road.

379
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:42,372
We don't want Daddy to get our germs
and get sick in outer space.

380
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:46,208
Hey, boys. Not giving your mom
a hard time, are you?

381
00:26:47,171 --> 00:26:49,480
Princess, you look beautiful.

382
00:27:11,295 --> 00:27:14,071
That looks like Marilyn Lovell.

383
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:16,804
But it can't be. She's not coming to the launch.

384
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:19,108
I heard it was gonna be a hell of a show.

385
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:20,681
Who told you that?

386
00:27:20,771 --> 00:27:22,443
Some guy I know.

387
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:28,156
You can't live without me.

388
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:31,554
Okay, folks. Let's say goodnight.

389
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,458
We got a big day tomorrow for these guys.

390
00:27:33,517 --> 00:27:35,360
Goodnight!

391
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:37,296
You hear about Ken?

392
00:27:37,788 --> 00:27:38,959
Yeah.

393
00:27:58,242 --> 00:28:00,051
Stand back, please.

394
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:04,884
Guenter Wendt!

395
00:28:05,449 --> 00:28:07,724
I wonder where Guenter went?

396
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:15,593
- You walk on the moon, ja?
- Ja, we walk...

397
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,962
and we talk on the moon.

398
00:28:25,836 --> 00:28:28,111
How do you feel? Pretty good?

399
00:28:30,441 --> 00:28:32,147
Might be a little warmer in here.

400
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:33,585
- How are you today?
- Good.

401
00:28:33,644 --> 00:28:35,020
- Ready?
- Yeah.

402
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:02,946
God, no.

403
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:15,963
Okay, we have the oxygen purge system.

404
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,055
Check.

405
00:29:17,121 --> 00:29:18,531
We have the helmet restraint ring.

406
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:20,090
Check.

407
00:29:31,135 --> 00:29:33,308
Communication umbilical on.

408
00:29:34,138 --> 00:29:35,241
- Fred.
- What?

409
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:36,785
- Gum.
- Sorry.

410
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,884
Thanks.

411
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,623
I'm gonna give these guys a beautiful ride.

412
00:29:45,716 --> 00:29:47,251
I'm sure you will, Jack.

413
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,906
You need more air?

414
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:20,827
You want some apple?

415
00:30:23,754 --> 00:30:25,597
I hate this already.

416
00:30:25,656 --> 00:30:27,635
You're not just about to pop, are you?

417
00:30:27,691 --> 00:30:31,434
No. I got 30 days till this blasts off.

418
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,819
This is for Gene.

419
00:31:20,644 --> 00:31:23,920
Mrs. Kranz has pulled out
the needle and thread again.

420
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:26,324
The last one looked
like he bought it off a gypsy.

421
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,590
Well, you can't argue with tradition.

422
00:31:28,652 --> 00:31:30,028
Copy that.

423
00:31:30,387 --> 00:31:32,332
This is from your wife, Gene.

424
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,394
Thank you, Tom.

425
00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:36,996
I was starting to get worried.

426
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:39,641
There we go.

427
00:31:42,132 --> 00:31:44,441
- I like that one, Gene.
- Sharp, Gene.

428
00:31:58,382 --> 00:32:00,225
Jim, you're all set.

429
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,066
Very sharp.

430
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:14,237
Gene, I guess we can go now.

431
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:16,707
Save it for splashdown, guys.

432
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:38,629
Apollo 13 flight controllers, listen up.

433
00:32:40,057 --> 00:32:42,400
Give me a "go, no go" for launch.

434
00:32:42,459 --> 00:32:43,528
- Booster.
- Go.

435
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:44,697
- RETRO.
- Go.

436
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:46,241

00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,434
- Guidance.
- Go.

438
00:32:47,531 --> 00:32:48,907
- Surgeon.
- Go, Flight.

439
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:50,035
EECOM.

440
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,977
- We're go, Flight.
- GNC.

441
00:32:52,069 --> 00:32:53,138

444
00:32:57,207 --> 00:32:58,981
- FAO.
- We are go.

445
00:32:59,076 --> 00:33:01,385
- Network. Recovery.
- Go.

446
00:33:01,478 --> 00:33:03,617
- CAPCOM.
- We're go, Flight.

447
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:07,561
Launch control, this is Houston.
We are go for launch.

448
00:33:08,185 --> 00:33:09,391
Roger that, Houston.

449
00:33:11,288 --> 00:33:12,994
Pad leader, what's your status?

450
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:14,968
Wo are go for iaunch.

451
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,471
T minus 60 seconds and counting.

452
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:44,055
- Stand by.
- Roger.

453
00:34:02,606 --> 00:34:04,016
Fuel pumps.

454
00:34:04,441 --> 00:34:07,854
This is it. A few bumps
and we're hauling the mail.

455
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:17,524
Control, this is Guidance.
We're ready for takeoff.

456
00:34:20,457 --> 00:34:22,300
We are go for launch.

457
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,995
T minus...

458
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:26,005
fifteen, fourteen...

459
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:29,500
thirteen, twelve, eleven...

460
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,974
ten, nine...

461
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,443
eight, seven...

462
00:34:35,005 --> 00:34:36,176
six.

463
00:34:36,373 --> 00:34:37,943
Ignition sequence starts.

464
00:34:38,308 --> 00:34:40,720
Three, two, one.

465
00:34:41,545 --> 00:34:42,887
Ignition!

466
00:35:06,236 --> 00:35:08,113
The clock is running!

467
00:35:15,312 --> 00:35:17,223
Wo have lift-off!

468
00:35:30,894 --> 00:35:35,069
Housfon, we have cleared the tower at 13: 13.

469
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:37,910
Okay, guys, we got it.

470
00:35:51,448 --> 00:35:52,983
Come on, baby.

471
00:35:57,454 --> 00:35:59,957
Altitude is on the line.

472
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:02,999
Velocity right on the line.

473
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,565
Roll complete. We are pitching.

474
00:36:06,663 --> 00:36:09,609
13, stand by for Mode One Bravo.

475
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:16,782
FIDO, how we looking?

476
00:36:17,407 --> 00:36:19,648
Looks good, Flight. Right down the middle.

477
00:36:21,111 --> 00:36:23,557
We see your BPC is clear, 13.

478
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:26,958
Roger. EDS to manual.

479
00:36:28,552 --> 00:36:29,792
Inboard.

480
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,791
Get ready for a little jolt, fellas.

481
00:36:46,336 --> 00:36:48,475
That was some little jolt.

482
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,321
Tower jett.

483
00:37:05,355 --> 00:37:08,995
Houston, we've got a center engine cut-off.
Go on the other four.

484
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,066
Roger that, 13. We show the same.

485
00:37:15,232 --> 00:37:17,371
Booster, can you confirm that cut-off?

486
00:37:17,434 --> 00:37:20,881
- Roger. Looks like we lost it.
- FIDO, what'll that do to us?

487
00:37:21,171 --> 00:37:22,377
Stand by, Flight.

488
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,883
I need to know if the lUs are correcting
for the number five shutdown.

489
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:37,262
Houston, what's the story on engine five?

490
00:37:39,723 --> 00:37:43,727
We're still go. We'll be all right
as long as we don't lose another one.

491
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:47,368
- Roger that.
- We're not sure why the inboard was out...

492
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,935
but the other engines are go,
so we're gonna burn those engines...

493
00:37:51,034 --> 00:37:52,877
a little bit longer.

494
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,416
Roger that. Our gimbals are good.

495
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:57,745
Our trim is good.

496
00:38:01,211 --> 00:38:04,658
Looks like we just had our glitch
for this mission.

497
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:16,702
- 13, stand by for staging.
- Roger that.

498
00:38:17,394 --> 00:38:20,568
S-2 shutdown. S-4B ignition.

499
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:23,402
Thrust looks good, Flight.

500
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:27,175
Flight, S-4B cut-off in 10 seconds.

501
00:38:27,237 --> 00:38:31,583
13, this is Houston.
Predicted cut-off is 12 plus 34, over.

502
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,889
Coming up on 12 minutes, 34.

503
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:38,751
And...

504
00:38:39,182 --> 00:38:40,319
SECO!

505
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:43,092
Shutdown.

506
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:46,530
And that, gentlemen, is how we do that.

507
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,621
Oh, boy. Hope I can sleep.

508
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,495
Mom, that was loud.

509
00:39:17,854 --> 00:39:19,663
Here, hold my hand.

510
00:39:20,657 --> 00:39:23,296
I can't believe you did this four times.

511
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,804
The worst part's over.

512
00:39:24,861 --> 00:39:26,101
It is?

513
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:31,879
Listen, this doesn't stop for me
until he lands on that aircraft carrier.

514
00:39:32,202 --> 00:39:34,147
Well, you just look so calm about it.

515
00:39:34,204 --> 00:39:38,345
If the flight surgeon had to okay me
for this mission, I'd be grounded.

516
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:41,218
- Mrs. Lovell! Mrs. Haise!
- Can we speak to you?

517
00:39:41,611 --> 00:39:43,954
Can we just have a word with you, please?

518
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:47,290
Remember, you're proud, happy, and thrilled.

519
00:39:48,051 --> 00:39:50,554
- How're you feeling?
- Very proud...

520
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,861
and very happy, and we're thrilled.

521
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,469
Flight, Booster. I show S-4B shutdown.

522
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,676
TLl is on the money. Looks good, Flight.

523
00:40:02,799 --> 00:40:04,243
Roger, FIDO.

524
00:40:07,971 --> 00:40:09,677
We're going to the moon!

525
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,220
Flight, we have reacquisition
of signal at Hawaii.

526
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,311
Flight, everything looks good.

527
00:40:15,812 --> 00:40:17,757
Okay, Houston. CMP here.

528
00:40:17,881 --> 00:40:21,157
I've exchanged couches with Jim.
I'm in the pilot's seat.

529
00:40:22,185 --> 00:40:25,495
I'm gonna go ahead and get set
for transposition and docking.

530
00:40:25,922 --> 00:40:27,662
Roger that, Jack.

531
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,376
Freddo, you okay?

532
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:49,549
Everybody, let's get turned around
and pick up the lunar module.

533
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,286
Odyssey, you're go for pyro arm and docking...

534
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:56,063
and we recommend you secure cabin pressurization.

535
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:58,297
Roger that.

536
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:02,167
Okay, we're ready for CSM separation.

537
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:07,770
Okay, SMRCS isol valves are all gray.

538
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,673
Okay, Swigert, command module pilot.

539
00:41:11,034 --> 00:41:12,706
She's all yours.

540
00:41:17,507 --> 00:41:19,850
Houston, we've got a good separation.

541
00:41:19,943 --> 00:41:22,685
- The S-4B is stable.
- Translation looks good.

542
00:41:22,846 --> 00:41:26,122
- Reconfirm then, 13.
- We're gonna start to pitch around...

543
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,128
to line up with the LEM.

544
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:30,287
You know, Freddo, Frank Borman...

545
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,393
was upchucking most of the way
to the moon on Apollo 8.

546
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:37,563
I'm all right. I just ate too much breakfast.
Let's go to work.

547
00:41:38,962 --> 00:41:40,634
And pitching up.

548
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:43,868
Pitch rate, 2.5 degrees per second.

549
00:41:44,367 --> 00:41:45,902
Roger, Jack.

550
00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:48,004
We see you pitching around.

551
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:49,742
Keep an eye on that telemetry.

552
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:54,220
Roger that. If Swigert can't
dock this thing, we don't have a mission.

553
00:41:55,812 --> 00:41:58,383
- How's the alignment?
- GDC align.

554
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,394
Thrusting forward.

555
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:08,996
One hundred feet.

556
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:16,268
Watch the alignment now.

557
00:42:24,574 --> 00:42:26,178
Don't worry, guys.

558
00:42:26,276 --> 00:42:27,982
I'm on top of it.

559
00:42:32,282 --> 00:42:34,352
FIDC, let me know when you're ready.

560
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:35,861
Let's uplink that.

561
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:40,624
- How we looking?
- We're not there yet. Forty feet.

562
00:42:42,759 --> 00:42:43,999
Twenty.

563
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,169
Come on, rookie, park that thing.

564
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:58,883
Ten feet.

565
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:10,793
Capture.

566
00:43:11,254 --> 00:43:12,562
That's it.

567
00:43:12,622 --> 00:43:15,932
- Talk back is barber pole.
- Go ahead and retract.

568
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:21,373
Houston, we have hard dock.

569
00:43:21,464 --> 00:43:24,376
Roger, we understand. That's a good deal, Jack.

570
00:43:24,467 --> 00:43:27,038
Let's start back up with procedure 17.

571
00:43:28,705 --> 00:43:31,151
Houston, we have LEM extraction.

572
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:32,913
Wo copy that, 13.

573
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:35,517
Now you're off to the Fra Mauro Highlands.

574
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:39,251
- I gotta get out of this suit.
- Houston, we are ready...

575
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:41,556
for the beginning of the PTC...

576
00:43:41,651 --> 00:43:45,894
and I think once we're in that barbecue roll,
Jack and I will eat.

577
00:43:46,489 --> 00:43:48,866
- Hey, I'm hungry.
- Are you sure?

578
00:43:48,992 --> 00:43:52,063
I could eat the ass out of a dead rhinoceros.

579
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:58,504
- We got a smooth one?
- By the numbers so far.

580
00:43:58,568 --> 00:44:01,605
We just ran a minimum load test
on the cooling system...

581
00:44:03,106 --> 00:44:05,176
- See you tomorrow.
- Take care.

582
00:44:20,023 --> 00:44:23,026
It's too bad we can't demonstrate this on TV.

583
00:44:23,526 --> 00:44:25,027
What a shame.

584
00:44:31,968 --> 00:44:33,447
Overboard dump coming up.

585
00:44:37,707 --> 00:44:39,277
Here it comes...

586
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:41,355
the constellation Urion.

587
00:44:45,448 --> 00:44:47,484
Now, that's a beautiful sight.

588
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:51,463
Barbara, we are going to your father's broadcast.

589
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:53,794
No! I'm never coming out!

590
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:58,530
I hate Paul! No one else
can ever play their records again!

591
00:44:58,728 --> 00:45:02,038
She's still going on about
the stupid Beatles breaking up?

592
00:45:02,098 --> 00:45:04,737
They're not stupid! You're stupid!

593
00:45:04,801 --> 00:45:06,041
I know you're in mourning.

594
00:45:06,102 --> 00:45:08,707
I'm not going, Mom!
Dad won't know if we're there!

595
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:12,913
The whole world is going to be watching
this broadcast, and so are we.

596
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,816
Good evening, America...

597
00:45:18,915 --> 00:45:21,452
and welcome aboard Apollo 13.

598
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,925
I'm Jim Lovell,
and we're broadcasting to you tonight...

599
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:29,766
from an altitude of almost 200,000 miles...

600
00:45:30,593 --> 00:45:32,732
away from the face of the Earth...

601
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:35,572
and we have a pretty good show
in store for you tonight.

602
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:37,975
We are going to show you just what...

603
00:45:38,101 --> 00:45:40,911
life is like for the three of us here...

604
00:45:41,504 --> 00:45:44,109
in the vast expanse of outer space.

605
00:45:44,674 --> 00:45:47,120
One of the first things we'd like to do...

606
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:50,487
is provide you
with the appropriate background music.

607
00:45:51,781 --> 00:45:53,851
So, hit it there, Freddo.

608
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:13,679
That was supposed to be the theme fo 2001...

609
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:16,240
in honor of our command module, Odyssey.

610
00:46:16,339 --> 00:46:20,048
There seems to have been
a last-minute change in the program.

611
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:25,022
When I go up on 19, I'm gonna take
my entire collection of Johnny Cash along.

612
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:31,190
- Hey, Marilyn.
- Where's their broadcast?

613
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:34,266
All the networks dumped us.

614
00:46:34,357 --> 00:46:36,393
One said we made going to the moon...

615
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:38,768
as exciting as a trip to Pittsburgh.

616
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:43,003
My son's supposed to be on.

617
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:45,176
He's in outer space.

618
00:46:47,036 --> 00:46:50,107
This is all the channels we get, Mrs. Lovell.

619
00:46:51,674 --> 00:46:53,949
It's that damn TV Guide again.

620
00:46:54,744 --> 00:46:56,450
Ruthless porters.

621
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:59,186
Savage baggage masters...

622
00:47:12,595 --> 00:47:15,371
Do they know they're not on the air?

623
00:47:15,698 --> 00:47:18,337
We'll tell them when they get back.

624
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:26,116
If anyone from the IRS is watching...

625
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:29,714
I forgot to file my 1040 return.

626
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:31,883
I meant to do it today...

627
00:47:31,981 --> 00:47:34,324
That's no joke. They'll jump on him.

628
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,960
Well, folks, let's head on down
to the lunar excursion module.

629
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,365
Follow me.

630
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:44,063
When we get ready to land on the moon...

631
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:48,403
Fred Haise and I
will float through this access tunnel...

632
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:50,477
into the lunar module, leaving...

633
00:47:50,533 --> 00:47:53,639
EECOM, that stir's gonna be...

634
00:47:53,703 --> 00:47:56,843
on both H2 and both O2 tanks, is that correct?

635
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:59,810
The spacecraft will remain connected.

636
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,589
Well, folks, as you can probably tell...

637
00:48:04,647 --> 00:48:07,821
the Aquarius isn't much bigger
than a couple of telephone booths.

638
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,793
The skin of the LEM in some places...

639
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:12,388
is only as...

640
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:15,496
as thick as a couple of layers...

641
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:19,062
of tinfoil, and that's all that protects us
from the vacuum of space.

642
00:48:19,295 --> 00:48:23,937
We get away with this because the LEM
is designed only for flight in outer space.

643
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,071
Fred Haise, Renaissance man.

644
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:32,613
We'll head back up the tunnel now
and back into the Odyssey.

645
00:48:38,781 --> 00:48:41,386
All right, we've returned to the...

646
00:48:42,385 --> 00:48:44,296
Stand by one, Houston.

647
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:46,262
Gotcha!

648
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:51,328
Houston, that bang you heard
was Fred Haise on the cabin repress valve.

649
00:48:51,427 --> 00:48:54,339
He gets our hearts going
every time with that one.

650
00:48:57,233 --> 00:49:01,010
We're about to close out the Aquarius...

651
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:04,213
and return to the Odyssey.

652
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:09,285
Our next broadcast will be from Fra Mauro
on the surface of the moon.

653
00:49:10,813 --> 00:49:14,123
So, this is the crew of the Apollo 13...

654
00:49:14,884 --> 00:49:17,387
wishing everyone back on Earth...

655
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:20,630
a pleasant evening.

656
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:26,471
All right.

657
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:30,170
Daddy was funny.

658
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:33,010
They might air a few minutes on the news tonight.

659
00:49:33,069 --> 00:49:34,673
You'd think so.

660
00:49:36,472 --> 00:49:37,575
Bye.

661
00:49:38,808 --> 00:49:42,187
Well, between Jack's back taxes
and the Fred Haise show...

662
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:46,253
I'd say that was a pretty successful broadcast.

663
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:48,259
That was an excellent show.

664
00:49:48,351 --> 00:49:49,761
Thank you very much, Houston.

665
00:49:49,852 --> 00:49:52,059
We've got a couple of housekeeping procedures.

666
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:56,728
We'd like you to roll right
to 0-6-0 and null your rates.

667
00:49:57,093 --> 00:50:00,267
Roger that. Rolling right, 0-6-0.

668
00:50:05,234 --> 00:50:09,011
And then if you could give
your oxygen tanks a stir.

669
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,249
Roger that.

670
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:46,883
We've got a problem here.

671
00:50:47,877 --> 00:50:50,118
- What did you do?
- Nothing. I stirred the tanks.

672
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:58,425
This is Houston. Say again, please.

673
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:00,067
Houston, we have a problem.

674
00:51:01,891 --> 00:51:03,995
We have a main bus B undervolt.

675
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:07,233
- We've got a lot of thruster activity.
- What's with the computer?

676
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:10,572
It just went off line.
There's another master alarm.

677
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:13,079
- I'm checking the quad.
- That was no repress valve.

678
00:51:13,169 --> 00:51:16,081
Maybe it's in quad C. I'll reconfigure the RCS.

679
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:18,250
We've got a ping light.

680
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:22,186
We've got multiple caution and warnings.
We've got to reset and restart.

681
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,054
I'm going to SCS.

682
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:29,693
Flight, their heart rates are skyrocketing.

683
00:51:29,752 --> 00:51:33,427
- EECOM, what's your data telling you?
- O2 tank two not reading at all.

684
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:37,027
Tank one is at 725 psi and falling.

685
00:51:37,493 --> 00:51:39,870
Fuel cells one and three are...

686
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:43,276
What's going on? Flight, let me get back to you.

687
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:46,278
Flight, GNC . They're all over the place.

688
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:49,543
- They keep going close to gimbal lock.
- I keep losing radio signal.

689
00:51:49,605 --> 00:51:51,584
Their antennae must be flipped around.

690
00:51:51,674 --> 00:51:55,178
- They'll have to do it manually, if at all.
- One at a time, people.

691
00:51:55,578 --> 00:51:59,184
Is this an instrumentation problem
or real power loss?

692
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:02,192
It's reading a quadruple failure.
That can't happen.

693
00:52:02,251 --> 00:52:04,230
It's got to be instrumentation.

694
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,858
Get the hatch plugged.
A meteor may have hit the LEM.

695
00:52:06,956 --> 00:52:09,936
The tunnel's really torquing
with all this movement.

696
00:52:10,426 --> 00:52:14,271
Houston, we had a pretty large bang
associated with a master alarm.

697
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:16,173
Shit, it's main bus A.

698
00:52:16,265 --> 00:52:20,372
- Main bus A undervolt?
- Main bus A undervolt down to...

699
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:25,015
it's reading 25-and-a-half.
Main bus B is reading zip now.

700
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:27,445
We got a wicked shimmy up here.

701
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:30,217
These guys are talking about bangs and shimmies.

702
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,190
Doesn't sound like instrumentation.

703
00:52:32,281 --> 00:52:34,784
- You are breaking up.
- Can't get this hatch to seal.

704
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:39,356
Just stow it. If we'd been hit by a meteor,
we'd be dead by now.

705
00:52:39,555 --> 00:52:41,557
I'm gonna try to get us out of this.

706
00:52:41,657 --> 00:52:44,194
Houston, did you say switch to omni bravo?

707
00:52:44,293 --> 00:52:47,296
- Roger that, 13.
- The signal strength went way down.

708
00:52:47,363 --> 00:52:50,901
It's fighting me. What's the story?
We keep flirting with gimbal lock.

709
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,572
We need a confirmation. What systems are down?

710
00:52:56,906 --> 00:52:59,079
SMRCS, Helium one...

711
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:01,449
A and C are barber pole.

712
00:53:01,744 --> 00:53:04,622
Houston, I'm switching over Quad C to main A.

713
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:05,783
Roger that, 13.

714
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:08,988
Okay, Houston, fuel cell one, fuel cell three.

715
00:53:09,218 --> 00:53:13,598
We got a main bus B undervolt,
cryo pressure, suit compressor.

716
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:18,165
What don't we have? AC bus one, AC bus two.

717
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:21,737
Command module computer. O2 flow high.

718
00:53:21,964 --> 00:53:24,341
It may be a caution and warning failure.

719
00:53:24,433 --> 00:53:28,813
Houston, we are venting something out into space.

720
00:53:30,573 --> 00:53:33,952
I can see it outside window one right now.

721
00:53:35,778 --> 00:53:39,919
It's definitely a gas of some sort.

722
00:53:42,585 --> 00:53:44,724
It's got to be the oxygen.

723
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:04,774
Roger, Odyssey. We copy your venting.

724
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:05,978
Give me an alignment.

725
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:08,488
Let's think about things we can connect.

726
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:11,023
Let's start back at the beginning.

727
00:54:23,226 --> 00:54:25,865
Listen up. Quiet down, people.

728
00:54:30,499 --> 00:54:32,501
Let's stay cool, people.

729
00:54:32,568 --> 00:54:35,480
Procedures, I need
another computer up in the RTCC.

730
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:38,041
I want everybody to alert your support teams.

731
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:40,882
Wake up anybody you need and get them in here.

732
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:43,321
Let's work the problem, people.

733
00:54:43,479 --> 00:54:45,686
Let's not make things worse by guessing.

734
00:54:45,748 --> 00:54:49,991
13, this is Houston. We're going
around the room. We'll get you answers.

735
00:54:50,253 --> 00:54:54,030
We keep venting, we're gonna keep
hitting the edge of that deadband.

736
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:56,600
Take a look at the O2 on number one.

737
00:55:01,297 --> 00:55:03,299
200 pounds and falling.

738
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,302
O2 tank two still zero.

739
00:55:06,402 --> 00:55:09,906
218 psi and falling.
Is that what you're getting? Confirm.

740
00:55:09,972 --> 00:55:14,750
- We're seeing the same, 13.
- Can we review our status, Sy?

741
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:18,985
Let's look at this thing
from a standpoint of status.

742
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:26,460
What have we got on the spacecraft that's good?

743
00:55:28,791 --> 00:55:30,964
I'll get back to you, Gene.

744
00:55:32,628 --> 00:55:34,971
We're not gonna have power much longer.

745
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:37,607
The ship's bleeding to death.

746
00:55:45,474 --> 00:55:47,544
- Flight?
- Yeah. Go, EECCM.

747
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:52,449
Flight, I recommend we shut down
the reactant valves of the fuel cells.

748
00:55:53,716 --> 00:55:56,321
What the hell good is that gonna do?

749
00:55:56,552 --> 00:55:58,827
If the leak's there, we can isolate it.

750
00:55:59,221 --> 00:56:02,634
We can save what's left in the tanks,
and run on the good cell.

751
00:56:02,725 --> 00:56:07,196
You close them, you can't open them again.
You can't land on the moon with one cell.

752
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:10,203
Gene, the Odyssey is dying.

753
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,944
From my chair here, this is the last option.

754
00:56:21,877 --> 00:56:23,981
Yeah. Okay, Sy.

755
00:56:39,595 --> 00:56:42,769
Capcom, let's have them
close the reactant valves.

756
00:56:42,865 --> 00:56:44,708
13, this is Houston.

757
00:56:45,067 --> 00:56:50,039
We want you to close react valves
on cells one and three. Do you copy?

758
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:54,645
Are you saying you want the whole smash?

759
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:58,350
Closing down the react valves
for fuel cells shutdown?

760
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:02,519
Shutting down the fuel cells?
Did I hear you right?

761
00:57:03,085 --> 00:57:05,224
Yeah, they heard me right.

762
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:09,526
Tell them we think that's the only way
they can stop the leak.

763
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:10,900
Yeah, Jim...

764
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,373
we think that closing the react valves
may stop the leak.

765
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:27,246
- Did he copy that?
- Do you copy, Jim?

766
00:57:29,445 --> 00:57:31,390
Yes, Houston, we copy.

767
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:39,064
We just lost the moon.

768
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,971
Okay, Freddo, shut those down.

769
00:57:52,935 --> 00:57:54,846
Let's see what this does.

770
00:58:03,345 --> 00:58:05,256
If this doesn't work...

771
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:08,551
we're not gonna have enough power left
to get home.

772
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:28,707
- Shit!
- God damn it!

773
00:58:28,871 --> 00:58:32,045
Houston, O2 on one is still falling.

774
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:37,720
How long does it take to power up the LEM?

775
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,919
Three hours by the checklist.

776
00:58:40,616 --> 00:58:42,288
We don't have that much time.

777
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:43,956
Shit!

778
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:48,935
Jack, before the batteries
completely die on us in here...

779
00:58:49,024 --> 00:58:53,631
let's power down everything so we can save
as much as we can for re-entry.

780
00:58:54,897 --> 00:58:58,401
Fifteen minutes of oxygen, that's it.
The command module will be dead.

781
00:58:58,467 --> 00:59:01,277
Okay, guys, listen up. Here's the drill.

782
00:59:01,403 --> 00:59:03,382
We're moving the astronauts to the LEM.

783
00:59:03,439 --> 00:59:05,145
We've got to get oxygen up there.

784
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:09,120
TELMU, Control, I want emergency
power procedure. Essential hardware only.

785
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:13,489
GNC, EECOM, we'll be shutting down
the command module at the same time.

786
00:59:13,582 --> 00:59:16,460
We've to transfer the guidance system
to another computer.

787
00:59:16,552 --> 00:59:19,396
I want those numbers up and ready
when they're in position.

788
00:59:19,455 --> 00:59:23,767
Transfer all data over the LEM
computer before the command module dies.

789
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:26,067
The lunar module just became a lifeboat.

790
00:59:26,328 --> 00:59:30,298
Odyssey, this is Houston.
We need you to power down immediately.

791
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:34,137
Power up the LEM at the same time,
so get somebody over there.

792
00:59:34,236 --> 00:59:36,648
We already have Freddo in the LEM.

793
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,809
We've got serious time pressure.

794
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:41,479
Get the guidance program transferred...

795
00:59:41,577 --> 00:59:44,148
before you're out of power
in the command module...

796
00:59:44,346 --> 00:59:46,792
or you're not gonna be able to navigate.

797
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,861
How much time? Can you give me a number?

798
00:59:48,951 --> 00:59:53,160
We're looking at less than
15 minutes of life support in the Odyssey.

799
00:59:56,592 --> 01:00:00,267
We've got 15 minutes, Freddo.
It's worse than I thought.

800
01:00:02,097 --> 01:00:05,840
Houston, I've moved
from the command module into the LEM.

801
01:00:06,969 --> 01:00:10,507
If Jack can't get that data transferred
before they go dead...

802
01:00:10,606 --> 01:00:12,881
They won't know which way they're pointed.

803
01:00:12,975 --> 01:00:15,682
- That's a bad way to fly.
- I'll be in 210 if you need me.

804
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:21,053
Houston, this is 13. Are you back with me now?

805
01:00:22,718 --> 01:00:26,461
Aquarius, this is Houston.
You now have about 12 minutes to power up.

806
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:30,902
I can't see any stars. Man, there's
a lot of debris floating around out there.

807
01:00:32,461 --> 01:00:35,168
Houston, I have completed the steps on Page 15.

808
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:37,210
I'm ready to power down the computer.

809
01:00:38,534 --> 01:00:42,880
I'm gonna need your gimbal angles, Jack,
before you shut down the computer!

810
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:44,476
Okay, Jim.

811
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,519
I need this back before they power down.

812
01:00:46,575 --> 01:00:49,021
All right, I got it. Hold on.

813
01:00:50,045 --> 01:00:53,219
- Houston, our computer is up.
- Roger. Stand by.

814
01:00:54,416 --> 01:00:58,364
Jack, we need to proceed
with steps 12 through 17 quickly.

815
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:01,924
You're down to about eight minutes remaining.

816
01:01:02,491 --> 01:01:05,597
Fuel cell pump's off. O2 fans, tank two off.

817
01:01:05,794 --> 01:01:09,742
Okay, Houston, check me.
I have completed the gimbal conversions...

818
01:01:09,798 --> 01:01:13,143
but I need a double check of the arithmetic.

819
01:01:13,235 --> 01:01:17,740
- Yeah, you can go, Jim.
- The roll CAL angle is minus two.

820
01:01:17,906 --> 01:01:21,410
Lunar module roll is 355.57.

821
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:24,989
1678, correction.

822
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:27,992
167 .78.

823
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:30,662
Yaw is 351 .87.

824
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:32,288
Stand by. We're checking it.

825
01:01:32,354 --> 01:01:34,834
We've got negative visibility
in our star field...

826
01:01:34,923 --> 01:01:39,530
and if this paperwork isn't right,
who knows where we'll end up out here.

827
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:48,007
Looks good, Flight.

828
01:01:48,103 --> 01:01:50,446
- It's all right.
- Good here.

829
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:52,847
- He's good, Andy.
- We'll go on those numbers.

830
01:01:52,941 --> 01:01:54,545
- Yeu're good.
- Log them in, Freddo.

831
01:01:54,643 --> 01:01:56,247
Turn off the lMU . Switch to SCS.

832
01:01:57,012 --> 01:01:59,458
Stand by. Over.

833
01:01:59,848 --> 01:02:03,124
It's a great day in New York.
It's girl watchers' weather.

834
01:02:03,285 --> 01:02:06,425
I like the ingenious girl watchers
who wear Con Edison helmets...

835
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:10,197
and dig trenches in the street
to get a better view.

836
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:12,466
But speaking of girl watching...

837
01:02:12,561 --> 01:02:16,099
did you know that our first bachelor
astronaut is on his way to the moon?

838
01:02:16,198 --> 01:02:18,701
Is it Swigert? Yeah, first bachelor.

839
01:02:18,767 --> 01:02:23,045
They say he's the kind who has a girl
in every port. He has that reputation.

840
01:02:23,138 --> 01:02:27,552
He's sort of foolishly optimistic, taking
nylons and Hershey bars to the moon.

841
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:32,088
Did you read that three million...

842
01:02:32,147 --> 01:02:34,820
What do you say? Less viewers or fewer viewers?

843
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:38,421
Three million fewer viewers...

844
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:40,829
watched the space shot than did the last one.

845
01:02:46,128 --> 01:02:49,438
Here is ABC science editor Jules Bergman.

846
01:02:50,165 --> 01:02:53,771
The Apollo 13 spacecraft
has lost all electrical power...

847
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:56,578
astronauts Jim Lovell,
Fred Haise and Jack Swigert...

848
01:02:56,638 --> 01:02:59,175
are making their way to the lunar module...

849
01:02:59,274 --> 01:03:02,084
using it as a lifeboat
so they'll have electrical power...

850
01:03:02,177 --> 01:03:04,020
for their radios on the command module.

851
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,025
Apollo 13 is apparently
also losing breathing oxygen...

852
01:03:07,082 --> 01:03:10,392
Slow down. An "electrical failure."
What exactly does that mean?

853
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:13,398
The emergency has
ruled out any chance of a lunar landing...

854
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:16,196
and could endanger the lives of the astronauts...

855
01:03:16,258 --> 01:03:20,365
if the LEM oxygen supply, plus whatever
is left of the command module's oxygen...

856
01:03:20,529 --> 01:03:22,838
can't last them until they can get back to Earth.

857
01:03:22,898 --> 01:03:24,672
What do you mean, "no immediate danger"?

858
01:03:24,733 --> 01:03:27,543
I heard they're losing oxygen. Can they get back?

859
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:31,243
The LEM's descent rocket engine
will be used in aborting the mission...

860
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:33,513
and getting them safely back to Earth.

861
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:35,446
Recapping what has happened.

862
01:03:35,544 --> 01:03:38,547
The Apollo 13 astronauts may be in grave danger.

863
01:03:38,614 --> 01:03:40,388
No, don't give me that NASA bullshit!

864
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:42,895
I want to know what's happening with my husband!

865
01:03:42,951 --> 01:03:45,021
We want to switch control to the Aquarius now.

866
01:03:45,087 --> 01:03:46,793
- Roger that.
- Houston, wait!

867
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:49,631
Yeu're down to about five minutes now.

868
01:03:49,925 --> 01:03:54,897
Be aware our RCS isn't up here yet.
We have no attitude control on Aquarius.

869
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:58,605
They don't have control? Did we miss a step here?

870
01:03:58,767 --> 01:04:02,874
- Control, what the hell happened?
- I don't know. We need more time.

871
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:07,748
We're out of whack.

872
01:04:07,843 --> 01:04:10,380
I'm trying to pitch down
but we're yawing to the left.

873
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:12,322
Why can't I null this out?

874
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:15,384
She wasn't designed to fly attached like this.

875
01:04:16,351 --> 01:04:19,525
It's like flying with a dead elephant
on our back.

876
01:04:19,588 --> 01:04:22,193
Flight, Guidance.
We're getting close to center here.

877
01:04:22,257 --> 01:04:25,602
Watch that middle gimbal.
We don't want you tumbling off into space.

878
01:04:25,694 --> 01:04:28,401
Inform them I'm well aware
of the goddamn gimbals!

879
01:04:29,231 --> 01:04:31,836
Roger that. I don't need to hear the obvious.

880
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:33,504
I can see the frapping eight-ball!

881
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:34,877
Andy, we're on VOX.

882
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:37,883
Aquarius, this is Houston.
We've got you both on VOX.

883
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:40,277
You want us to go to VOX?

884
01:04:40,542 --> 01:04:43,613
You have a hot mike.
We are reading everything you say.

885
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:45,223
Sorry, Jim.

886
01:04:47,282 --> 01:04:49,386
It's only by a very narrow margin...

887
01:04:49,451 --> 01:04:53,421
that we're going to get
Lovell, Haise and Swigert back alive.

888
01:04:56,725 --> 01:04:59,205
I'm sorry. Jeffrey's calling for you.

889
01:04:59,261 --> 01:05:03,300
The terseness of Kraft
and the grim lines of Jim McDivitt.

890
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:07,840
This has been a very close call.
We're not out of the woods yet.

891
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:17,786
Why are so many people here?

892
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:23,492
Your dad's flying his mission.

893
01:05:26,221 --> 01:05:29,065
He said he was going to get me a moon rock.

894
01:05:29,157 --> 01:05:30,363
Right.

895
01:05:36,598 --> 01:05:39,544
Something broke on your daddy's spaceship...

896
01:05:40,936 --> 01:05:44,815
and he's gonna have to turn around
before he even gets to the moon.

897
01:05:49,444 --> 01:05:51,116
Was it the door?

898
01:05:52,381 --> 01:05:55,623
13, we still show that venting
pushing you around.

899
01:05:55,717 --> 01:05:58,254
- How you doing?
- Houston, Aquarius.

900
01:05:58,787 --> 01:06:03,599
We've had to learn how to fly all over again,
but we are doing better now.

901
01:06:03,825 --> 01:06:07,602
- Roger that, Aquarius.
- Have him close it out.

902
01:06:08,163 --> 01:06:11,109
Jack, we can close out your procedure now.

903
01:06:13,168 --> 01:06:16,615
Do we know for sure
that we can power this thing back up?

904
01:06:17,205 --> 01:06:19,810
It's gonna get awfully cold in here.

905
01:06:20,108 --> 01:06:23,851
Copy that, Jack.
We'll just have to deal with that later.

906
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:29,386
- Computer off.
- We're clear.

907
01:06:29,851 --> 01:06:31,853
We're going to the LEM.

908
01:06:32,654 --> 01:06:34,656
We confirm shutdown, Jack.

909
01:06:34,723 --> 01:06:36,725
Lunar module now in control.

910
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:45,869
Roger that, Houston. This is Odyssey signing off.

911
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:04,923
Freddo, we're gonna have to execute
some sort of burn.

912
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:07,065
It's just a matter of when.

913
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:14,273
- Did they shut us all down in there?
- Yeah.

914
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:18,643
Didn't think we'd be back in here so soon.

915
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:23,914
Houston, how far off course
do you project we are? Over.

916
01:07:27,643 --> 01:07:29,452
Okay, people, listen up!

917
01:07:29,511 --> 01:07:32,821
Gentlemen, I want you all
to forget the flight plan.

918
01:07:33,749 --> 01:07:37,321
From this moment on,
we are improvising a new mission.

919
01:07:39,921 --> 01:07:43,197
Sorry about that.
We'll get somebody to look at that.

920
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:45,835
How do we get our people home?

921
01:07:48,463 --> 01:07:49,600
They are here.

922
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:52,542
- Do we turn them around, direct abort?
- Yes!

923
01:07:56,304 --> 01:07:59,341
No, sir! We get them on a free-return trajectory.

924
01:07:59,441 --> 01:08:02,251
It's the option
with the fewest question marks for safety.

925
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:05,450
I agree. We use the moon's gravity
to slingshot them around.

926
01:08:05,547 --> 01:08:09,222
No, the LEM will not support three guys
for that amount of time.

927
01:08:09,284 --> 01:08:13,926
I think we've got to do a direct abort. We do
an about-face, bring the guys right home.

928
01:08:14,022 --> 01:08:15,626
Get them back soon. Absolutely.

929
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:18,204
We don't even know
if the Odyssey's engine's working.

930
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:21,900
- If there's been serious damage to the craft...
- They blow up and they die!

931
01:08:21,963 --> 01:08:24,409
That is not the argument!
We're talking about time!

932
01:08:24,466 --> 01:08:27,606
- Not whether these guys...
- I'm not gonna sugarcoat this for you!

933
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:30,149
Okay, hold it. Let's hold it down.

934
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:33,651
The only engine we've got
with enough power for a direct abort...

935
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:35,812
is the SPS on the service module.

936
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:38,482
It could have been damaged in an explosion...

937
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:40,218
so let's consider that engine dead.

938
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:42,386
We light it up, could blow the whole works.

939
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:44,988
Just too risky. We're not gonna take that chance.

940
01:08:45,087 --> 01:08:47,794
The only thing
the command module's good for is re-entry.

941
01:08:47,889 --> 01:08:51,598
That leaves us with the LEM,
which means free-return trajectory.

942
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:54,105
Once we get the guys around the moon...

943
01:08:54,162 --> 01:08:56,471
we'll fire up the LEM engine, make a long burn...

944
01:08:56,565 --> 01:08:59,307
pick up some speed,
and get them home as quick as we can.

945
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:03,144
Gene, I'm wondering
what the Grumman guys think about this.

946
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:07,517
We can't make any guarantees.
We designed the LEM to land on the moon...

947
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:10,056
not fire the engine for course corrections.

948
01:09:10,145 --> 01:09:14,024
Well, unfortunately, we're not
landing on the moon, are we?

949
01:09:15,584 --> 01:09:19,327
I don't care what anything was designed
to do. I care about what it can do.

950
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:22,767
So let's get to work. Let's lay it out, okay?

951
01:09:23,725 --> 01:09:27,001
Capcom, Flight, he says it will be ready in time.

952
01:09:27,195 --> 01:09:31,199
After this burn, we've got to build time
in the flight plan for them to get sleep.

953
01:09:31,266 --> 01:09:34,076
- Run it by the FAO.
- I've run it by the FAO.

954
01:09:34,169 --> 01:09:36,342
Do we know how long we're gonna fire that burn?

955
01:09:36,404 --> 01:09:40,010
- He wanted a quote from a flight director.
- Who wanted a quote?

956
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:41,781
- The President.
- The President?

957
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:43,754
Nixon. He wants our odds.

958
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:47,090
We are not losing the crew.

959
01:09:47,382 --> 01:09:50,852
Gene, I gotta give him
odds. Five to one against? Three to one?

960
01:09:50,919 --> 01:09:54,298
- I don't think they're that good.
- We are not losing those men.

961
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:01,634
How long are they gonna have
to burn the engine PC + 2?

962
01:10:03,098 --> 01:10:05,373
Look, tell him three to one.

963
01:10:08,303 --> 01:10:11,215
Expect loss of signal in less than one minute.

964
01:10:11,273 --> 01:10:14,447
When we pick you back up
we will have your PC + 2 burn data.

965
01:10:14,509 --> 01:10:19,116
Okay. Roger that, Houston. We'll hear
from you again at acquisition of signal.

966
01:10:21,950 --> 01:10:23,520
You wanna look?

967
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,260
Oh, look at that.

968
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:38,940
Aquarius, that's 30 seconds until loss of signal.

969
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:45,181
Mare Tranquillitatis.

970
01:10:47,275 --> 01:10:49,687
Neil and Buzz's old neighborhood.

971
01:10:50,545 --> 01:10:52,718
Coming up on Mount Marilyn.

972
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:55,452
Jim, you gotta take a look at this.

973
01:10:57,052 --> 01:10:58,553
I've seen it.

974
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:06,567
Aquarius, this is Houston.

975
01:11:06,628 --> 01:11:10,234
We expect loss of signal
in approximately ten seconds.

976
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:14,413
So long, Earth. Catch you on the flip side.

977
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:23,923
When you go into the shadow of the moon...

978
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:26,425
and the moon is between you and the sun...

979
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:30,555
you see stars that are more brilliant
than anything you've ever seen...

980
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:32,689
on the clearest nights here on Earth.

981
01:11:32,754 --> 01:11:37,703
And then you pass into the lunar sunrise
over the lunar surtace.

982
01:11:38,927 --> 01:11:43,102
It must be an awe-inspiring sight.
I can't wait to see it myself.

983
01:11:43,531 --> 01:11:48,070
The problem now is not so much a question
of adequate oxygen supply...

984
01:11:48,136 --> 01:11:50,275
but it is the rate of consumption of water...

985
01:11:50,405 --> 01:11:53,476
which is vitally needed
for the cooling operations...

986
01:11:53,575 --> 01:11:55,645
to maintain the electronic systems...

987
01:12:34,316 --> 01:12:36,193
Look, it's Fra Mauro.

988
01:12:38,353 --> 01:12:40,526
I can see our landing site.

989
01:12:44,225 --> 01:12:46,671
Look at the Tsiolkovsky Crater.

990
01:12:49,197 --> 01:12:52,109
I can't believe how bright the ejecta blanket is.

991
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:55,078
It's like snow. It's beautiful.

992
01:12:57,238 --> 01:12:59,684
That's Mare lmbrium to the north.

993
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:04,748
13, this is Houston.

994
01:14:04,806 --> 01:14:08,583
We're reading your telemetry.
It's good to see you again.

995
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:11,147
Good to see you, too, Houston.

996
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:15,383
We are picking you up
at a velocity of 7,062 feet per second...

997
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:19,125
at a distance from the moon of 56 nautical miles.

998
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:22,266
Stand by for your PC + 2 burn data.

999
01:14:23,291 --> 01:14:27,500
Got to tell you, I had an itch to take
this baby down, do some prospecting.

1000
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:30,773
Damn, we were close.

1001
01:14:33,468 --> 01:14:36,107
Gentlemen, what are your intentions?

1002
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:42,118
I'd like to go home.

1003
01:14:44,779 --> 01:14:46,815
We got a burn coming up.

1004
01:14:47,082 --> 01:14:50,188
We're gonna need a contingency
if we lose comm with Houston.

1005
01:14:50,685 --> 01:14:54,155
Let's get an idea where we stand
on the consumables.

1006
01:14:54,856 --> 01:14:57,131
Jack, get into the Odyssey...

1007
01:14:57,192 --> 01:15:00,662
and bag up all the water you can
before it freezes in there.

1008
01:15:03,398 --> 01:15:04,433
Let's go home.

1009
01:15:04,499 --> 01:15:08,037
Aquarius, we got some
PC + 2 burn data for you fellas.

1010
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:13,109
So you're telling me
you can only give our guys 45 hours?

1011
01:15:13,908 --> 01:15:16,320
That brings them to about there.

1012
01:15:21,015 --> 01:15:22,494
Gentlemen, that's not acceptable.

1013
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:25,428
Gene, we've got to talk about power.

1014
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:28,197
Guys! Power is everything!

1015
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:31,432
- Power is everything.
- What do you mean?

1016
01:15:31,526 --> 01:15:34,666
Without it, they don't talk to us,
correct their trajectory...

1017
01:15:34,729 --> 01:15:36,765
they don't turn the heat shield around.

1018
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:41,438
We gotta turn everything off. Now.
They're not gonna make it to re-entry.

1019
01:15:41,536 --> 01:15:45,245
- What do you mean, "everything"?
- If everything's on, the LEM draws 60 amps.

1020
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:49,083
At that rate, in 16 hours
the batteries are dead, not 45.

1021
01:15:49,544 --> 01:15:52,286
And so is the crew.
We gotta get them down to 12 amps.

1022
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:53,915
- Twelve amps?
- How many?

1023
01:15:54,015 --> 01:15:56,290
You can't run a vacuum cleaner on 12 amps, John.

1024
01:15:56,384 --> 01:15:59,922
We gotta turn off the radars, cabin heater...

1025
01:16:00,021 --> 01:16:02,467
instrument displays,
guidance computer, everything.

1026
01:16:02,524 --> 01:16:05,163
Guidance computer?
What if they need to do another burn?

1027
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:07,171
They won't know which way they're pointed.

1028
01:16:07,262 --> 01:16:09,469
The more time we talk, the more juice they waste.

1029
01:16:09,531 --> 01:16:11,271
I've looked at data for the past hour.

1030
01:16:11,332 --> 01:16:13,869
- That's the deal?
- That's the deal.

1031
01:16:18,473 --> 01:16:23,149
Okay, John. The minute we finish the burn,
we'll power down the LEM.

1032
01:16:23,211 --> 01:16:24,621
All right.

1033
01:16:25,313 --> 01:16:29,659
Now, in the meantime, we're gonna have
a frozen command module up there.

1034
01:16:29,817 --> 01:16:33,355
Soon, we'll have to power it up
using nothing but the re-entry batteries.

1035
01:16:33,454 --> 01:16:37,163
- That's never been tried before.
- We've never even simulated it before.

1036
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:39,466
Well, we're gonna have to figure it out.

1037
01:16:39,827 --> 01:16:43,001
I want people in our simulators
working re-entry scenarios.

1038
01:16:43,064 --> 01:16:46,534
I want you to find every engineer
who designed every switch, circuit...

1039
01:16:46,634 --> 01:16:48,135
transistor and light bulb up there.

1040
01:16:48,203 --> 01:16:51,912
Then, talk to the guy in the assembly line
who actually built the thing.

1041
01:16:52,006 --> 01:16:55,715
Find out how to squeeze every amp
out of both of these goddamn machines.

1042
01:16:56,377 --> 01:17:01,087
I want this mark all the way back to Earth
with time to spare.

1043
01:17:02,083 --> 01:17:03,618
We never lost an American in space.

1044
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:06,261
We're sure as hell not gonna lose one
on my watch.

1045
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:08,095
Failure is not an option.

1046
01:17:17,565 --> 01:17:19,908
- What?
- Good, you're not dead.

1047
01:17:20,168 --> 01:17:22,841
I've been trying to get in touch with you
for 45 minutes.

1048
01:17:22,937 --> 01:17:24,438
Jesus, what're you doing here?

1049
01:17:24,505 --> 01:17:27,144
I gotta get you in the simulator.
We got a ship to land.

1050
01:17:27,242 --> 01:17:29,449
- What?
- There's been an explosion.

1051
01:17:29,611 --> 01:17:33,149
Oxygen tanks are gone, two fuel cells gone,
command module's shut down.

1052
01:17:33,648 --> 01:17:35,855
- What about the crew?
- Crew's fine so far.

1053
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:38,089
Trying to keep them alive in the LEM.

1054
01:17:38,152 --> 01:17:41,098
We'll have to shut that down pretty soon, too.

1055
01:17:41,356 --> 01:17:44,200
We got a lot of people working
the numbers on this one.

1056
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:47,102
Nobody's too sure
how much power we'll have for re-entry.

1057
01:17:47,161 --> 01:17:50,107
The command module
will be frozen up pretty good by then.

1058
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:54,703
If you see this ammeter rise over 20
at any point, power-up is no good.

1059
01:17:54,802 --> 01:17:57,475
If it spikes, that's sayonara
for the guidance computer.

1060
01:17:57,538 --> 01:17:59,017
Our guys can't re-enter, okay?

1061
01:17:59,107 --> 01:18:01,018
How much power do we have to play with?

1062
01:18:01,109 --> 01:18:03,555
Barely enough to run this
coffee pot for nine hours.

1063
01:18:03,611 --> 01:18:06,114
- Go.
- Ken Mattingly just got here.

1064
01:18:06,214 --> 01:18:07,886
Copy. He's here.

1065
01:18:08,549 --> 01:18:10,585
They've been losing heat since the accident.

1066
01:18:10,685 --> 01:18:13,756
They'll start getting water condensation
on the control panels.

1067
01:18:13,855 --> 01:18:15,766
Glad you're here. You know what's going on?

1068
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:17,358
John's brought me up to speed.

1069
01:18:17,425 --> 01:18:19,598
- What's left in the batteries?
- We don't know.

1070
01:18:19,694 --> 01:18:22,106
We gotta get started
on some shortcuts for power-up.

1071
01:18:22,196 --> 01:18:23,572
You know how short?

1072
01:18:23,631 --> 01:18:27,544
It's all in the sequencing. If we can skip
whatever we don't absolutely need...

1073
01:18:27,602 --> 01:18:30,207
- turn things on in the right order, maybe...
- I agree.

1074
01:18:30,271 --> 01:18:33,809
- You started on a procedure?
- Engineers have tried, but it's your ship.

1075
01:18:33,908 --> 01:18:36,411
- We gotta get you in there.
- Okay.

1076
01:18:36,577 --> 01:18:39,148
Frank, I need the sim cold and dark.

1077
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:41,920
Give me the exact conditions
they've got in there now.

1078
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:44,622
- I need status of every instrument.
- You got it.

1079
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:47,722
I need a flashlight.
That's not what they have up there.

1080
01:18:47,789 --> 01:18:50,030
Don't give me anything they don't have on board.

1081
01:18:50,091 --> 01:18:53,436
Let's get this show on the road.
Put him in space, fellas.

1082
01:18:54,762 --> 01:18:58,573
Okay, Houston, the quad-heater
circuit breakers are open.

1083
01:18:58,633 --> 01:18:59,668
Copy that.

1084
01:18:59,767 --> 01:19:02,713
We'll use the forward omni
when the Earth's in the window...

1085
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:05,409
and we're switching to aft omni
when we see the moon.

1086
01:19:05,506 --> 01:19:07,144
Wo copy that, 13.

1087
01:19:07,208 --> 01:19:10,052
Aquarius, we don't want you
to make any more waste dumps.

1088
01:19:10,144 --> 01:19:12,715
The venting may push you off course.

1089
01:19:13,181 --> 01:19:15,388
- Oh, Christ.
- What's up?

1090
01:19:15,983 --> 01:19:19,862
No more waste dumps.
We're just gonna have to store it.

1091
01:19:20,321 --> 01:19:22,596
Jack, we're gonna need some more urine bags.

1092
01:19:23,491 --> 01:19:26,995
Okay, Houston,
that leaves us with just the computer...

1093
01:19:27,528 --> 01:19:29,769
which I'm shutting down now.

1094
01:19:36,738 --> 01:19:37,739
And that's it.

1095
01:19:38,873 --> 01:19:42,081
We just put Sir lsaac Newton
in the driver's seat.

1096
01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:49,191
Is it a.m. or p.m.?

1097
01:19:49,617 --> 01:19:52,791
A.m. Very, very a.m.

1098
01:19:52,887 --> 01:19:55,424
Haise is running a temperature,
and no one has slept.

1099
01:19:55,523 --> 01:19:59,471
I can't order these guys to go to sleep.
Could you sleep up there?

1100
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:02,472
It's gonna get awful cold
in there for those guys.

1101
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:07,141
Gene, we have a situation
brewing with the carbon dioxide.

1102
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:09,612
We got a CO2 filter problem on the lunar module.

1103
01:20:09,704 --> 01:20:13,242
- Five filters on the LEM.
- Meant for two guys for a day and a half.

1104
01:20:13,307 --> 01:20:15,719
- I told the doc...
- We're up to eight on the gauges.

1105
01:20:15,777 --> 01:20:19,122
Anything over 15
and you get impaired judgment, blackouts...

1106
01:20:19,213 --> 01:20:20,657
the beginnings of brain asphyxia.

1107
01:20:20,748 --> 01:20:22,659
What about scrubbers in the command module?

1108
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:26,254
- They take square cartridges.
- The ones on the LEM are round.

1109
01:20:27,588 --> 01:20:29,658
Tell me this isn't a government operation.

1110
01:20:29,724 --> 01:20:32,568
This just isn't a contingency
we've remotely looked at.

1111
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:34,834
Those CO2 levels will be getting toxic.

1112
01:20:34,929 --> 01:20:39,844
I suggest you gentlemen invent a way to put
a square peg in a round hole. Rapidly.

1113
01:20:43,404 --> 01:20:45,315
Okay, people, listen up!

1114
01:20:45,406 --> 01:20:50,184
The people upstairs have handed us
this one, and we gotta come through.

1115
01:20:50,511 --> 01:20:54,220
We gotta find a way to make this...

1116
01:20:54,916 --> 01:20:57,191
fit into the hole for this...

1117
01:20:57,452 --> 01:20:59,454
using nothing but that.

1118
01:21:01,589 --> 01:21:04,365
- Let's get it organized.
- Okay, let's build a filter.

1119
01:21:04,425 --> 01:21:06,928
Better get some coffee going, too.

1120
01:21:07,695 --> 01:21:10,266
The Halse family lives in El lago, Texas.

1121
01:21:10,331 --> 01:21:13,038
His wife, Mary, is from Biloxi, Mississippi.

1122
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:17,377
When Fred Haise was growing up in Biloxi,
he may have looked ahead to a fine family...

1123
01:21:17,472 --> 01:21:18,882
but he never dreamt of flying.

1124
01:21:18,973 --> 01:21:21,544
I'd never flown before I went into the service...

1125
01:21:21,642 --> 01:21:25,521
and I only went into the flying business
as a means to getting a commission...

1126
01:21:25,613 --> 01:21:29,060
- Good morning.
- Henry. Don't you ever sleep?

1127
01:21:29,517 --> 01:21:32,259
I have a request from the news people.

1128
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:36,558
They're out front here and they want
to put a transmitter up on the lawn.

1129
01:21:38,359 --> 01:21:39,838
Transmitter?

1130
01:21:39,994 --> 01:21:42,599
It's kind of a tower for a live broadcast.

1131
01:21:47,869 --> 01:21:52,283
I thought they didn't care about the mission.
They didn't even run Jim's show.

1132
01:21:53,407 --> 01:21:56,251
Well, it's more dramatic now.
Suddenly people are...

1133
01:21:56,344 --> 01:22:00,383
If landing on the moon wasn't dramatic
enough, why should not landing on it be?

1134
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:04,825
Look, I realize how hard this is, Marilyn...

1135
01:22:04,919 --> 01:22:06,830
but the whole world is caught up in it.

1136
01:22:06,921 --> 01:22:09,628
- It's the biggest story since...
- No, Henry.

1137
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:14,437
Those people don't put one piece
of equipment on my lawn.

1138
01:22:14,795 --> 01:22:18,299
If they have a problem with that,
they can take it up with my husband.

1139
01:22:18,366 --> 01:22:20,539
He'll be home on Friday.

1140
01:23:04,779 --> 01:23:06,258
Hey, Fred.

1141
01:23:07,048 --> 01:23:09,050
It's too cold in there.

1142
01:23:23,998 --> 01:23:26,137
That's a nice one of Mary.

1143
01:23:29,804 --> 01:23:33,046
- You don't look too good, Freddo.
- I'll survive.

1144
01:23:33,107 --> 01:23:35,450
- There's aspirin in the medical kit.
- I took some.

1145
01:23:35,509 --> 01:23:37,318
Jim, I'm all right.

1146
01:23:42,617 --> 01:23:46,257
It was an accident, Mary getting pregnant.

1147
01:23:47,788 --> 01:23:51,599
You should have seen the look on my face
when she told me.

1148
01:23:52,493 --> 01:23:55,166
Well, that has a tendency to happen.

1149
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:05,009
I wonder if it's a boy or a girl.

1150
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:08,920
You're gonna find out soon enough.

1151
01:24:09,877 --> 01:24:11,048
Sure.

1152
01:24:14,815 --> 01:24:18,057
I never dreamed I'd ever get
to do something like this.

1153
01:24:18,653 --> 01:24:20,894
Come up here on a real mission.

1154
01:24:22,089 --> 01:24:24,501
Most of the guys I graduated high school with...

1155
01:24:24,592 --> 01:24:26,935
never even left home, and here I am.

1156
01:24:27,294 --> 01:24:28,568
Oh, yeah.

1157
01:24:29,764 --> 01:24:31,140
Here you are.

1158
01:24:36,604 --> 01:24:38,583
It hurts when I urinate.

1159
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:44,111
- Well, you're not getting enough water.
- I'm drinking my ration the same as you.

1160
01:24:47,448 --> 01:24:50,087
I think old Swigert gave me the clap.

1161
01:24:51,085 --> 01:24:53,929
He's been pissing in my relief tube.

1162
01:24:56,691 --> 01:25:00,695
Well, that will be a hot one
at the debriefing for the flight surgeon.

1163
01:25:00,795 --> 01:25:04,834
That's another first for America's space program.

1164
01:25:07,168 --> 01:25:11,946
Listen, I've been going over some stuff...

1165
01:25:12,873 --> 01:25:17,583
and I'm a little worried about this cold
affecting our battery efficiency.

1166
01:25:18,112 --> 01:25:22,390
We quit heating the glycol to save
water and power, so that's not helping.

1167
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:24,452
It could cost us amp hours on the back end?

1168
01:25:24,552 --> 01:25:25,758
That's a possibility.

1169
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:27,924
I've been going over the numbers again.

1170
01:25:28,022 --> 01:25:30,525
Have they called up with a re-entry plan yet?

1171
01:25:30,591 --> 01:25:33,094
- We're coming in too shallow...
- We're working on it.

1172
01:25:33,194 --> 01:25:36,869
I can't remember the ratio to temperature.
We got no references on board.

1173
01:25:36,931 --> 01:25:39,240
Let's see if Houston can pull up the mil specs...

1174
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:43,111
Listen, they gave us too much Delta V.
They had us burn too long.

1175
01:25:43,204 --> 01:25:46,742
At this rate we'll skip right out
of the atmosphere, and never get back.

1176
01:25:47,441 --> 01:25:50,387
What are you talking about?
How'd you figure that?

1177
01:25:50,544 --> 01:25:51,920
I can add.

1178
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:57,388
- Many PhDs are working on this.
- Houston says we're on the money.

1179
01:25:57,451 --> 01:26:00,454
What if they made a mistake
and there was no way to reverse it?

1180
01:26:00,554 --> 01:26:01,828
You think they'd tell us?

1181
01:26:01,889 --> 01:26:05,199
- There's no reason to tell us!
- What do you mean? That's bullshit!

1182
01:26:05,292 --> 01:26:07,738
There's 1,000 things
that have to happen in order.

1183
01:26:07,828 --> 01:26:12,709
We are on number eight.
You're talking about number 692.

1184
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:16,042
In the meantime, I'm trying to tell you
we're coming in too fast.

1185
01:26:16,137 --> 01:26:19,482
I think they know it, and that's why
we don't have a re-entry plan.

1186
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:21,747
That's duly noted. Thank you, Jack.

1187
01:26:23,144 --> 01:26:25,055
God damn this piece of shit!

1188
01:26:26,013 --> 01:26:28,152
This piece of shit's gonna get you home.

1189
01:26:28,215 --> 01:26:31,855
That's because that's the only thing
we've got left, Jack!

1190
01:26:32,853 --> 01:26:36,596
- What are you saying, Fred?
- I think you know what I'm saying.

1191
01:26:36,690 --> 01:26:39,761
Now wait a minute.
All I did was stir those tanks.

1192
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:42,340
What was the gauge reading
before you hit the switch?

1193
01:26:42,396 --> 01:26:45,866
Don't tell me how to fly the CM!
They brought me in to do a job!

1194
01:26:45,933 --> 01:26:49,175
They asked me to stir the damn tanks,
and I stirred the tanks!

1195
01:26:49,236 --> 01:26:52,012
- Stop kicking yourself in the ass.
- This is not my fault!

1196
01:26:52,072 --> 01:26:54,017
No one is saying it is.

1197
01:26:54,341 --> 01:26:58,050
If I'm in the left-hand seat
when the call comes up, I stir the tanks.

1198
01:26:58,112 --> 01:26:59,181
Well, tell him that.

1199
01:26:59,246 --> 01:27:02,488
I just asked you what the gauge
was reading, and you don't know!

1200
01:27:02,583 --> 01:27:04,426
Look, we're not doing this, gentlemen.

1201
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:07,261
We're not bouncing off the walls
for ten minutes...

1202
01:27:07,321 --> 01:27:10,267
because we'll just end up with the same problems!

1203
01:27:10,357 --> 01:27:12,962
Try to figure out how to stay alive!

1204
01:27:14,695 --> 01:27:16,003
Aquarius, this is Houston.

1205
01:27:16,063 --> 01:27:18,805
- Are we on VOX?
- No, we're not on VOX.

1206
01:27:18,966 --> 01:27:21,469
Yeah, Houston, this is Aquarius. Go ahead.

1207
01:27:22,603 --> 01:27:26,107
Yeah, Jim, could you check your CO2 gauge for us?

1208
01:27:29,243 --> 01:27:31,313
We were just looking at that.

1209
01:27:31,378 --> 01:27:35,348
Our CO2 measurement
has jumped four notches in the last hour.

1210
01:27:35,516 --> 01:27:38,553
That can't be right.
I went over those numbers three times.

1211
01:27:38,652 --> 01:27:42,156
Jim, that sounds about right.
We were expecting that.

1212
01:27:42,389 --> 01:27:45,836
That's very comforting to know, Houston.
What do we do about it?

1213
01:27:45,893 --> 01:27:49,033
Jim, we're working
on a procedure down here for you.

1214
01:27:51,098 --> 01:27:52,907
- Do you copy?
- Oh, Christ.

1215
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,241
All right, we're standing by
for those procedures.

1216
01:27:55,336 --> 01:27:57,748
Christ, I know why my numbers are wrong.

1217
01:27:58,672 --> 01:28:01,084
I only figured it for two people.

1218
01:28:04,945 --> 01:28:07,482
Maybe I should just hold my breath.

1219
01:28:08,515 --> 01:28:11,222
The deadly CC2 gas is literally poisoning...

1220
01:28:11,285 --> 01:28:13,526
the astronauts with every breath in and out.

1221
01:28:13,587 --> 01:28:14,929
Heads up.

1222
01:28:17,424 --> 01:28:18,493
Go.

1223
01:28:20,294 --> 01:28:22,330
Heads up, people. Look out now.

1224
01:28:25,266 --> 01:28:28,212
- What's this?
- That's what they gotta make.

1225
01:28:29,003 --> 01:28:30,675
I hope you got the procedures for me.

1226
01:28:30,738 --> 01:28:31,773
Right here.

1227
01:28:31,839 --> 01:28:33,215
That's it?

1228
01:28:35,843 --> 01:28:37,947
All right, Aquarius, this is Houston.

1229
01:28:38,045 --> 01:28:40,047
Do you have a flight plan up there?

1230
01:28:40,147 --> 01:28:43,287
Affirmative, Andy. Jack's got one right here.

1231
01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:47,161
Okay, we have an unusual procedure for you here.

1232
01:28:47,221 --> 01:28:49,166
We need you to rip the cover off.

1233
01:28:49,323 --> 01:28:51,996
He wants you
to rip the cover off the flight plan.

1234
01:28:52,559 --> 01:28:54,129
With pleasure.

1235
01:28:54,361 --> 01:28:56,738
The other materials you'll need are...

1236
01:28:57,031 --> 01:28:58,908
a lithium hydroxide canister...

1237
01:28:58,999 --> 01:29:01,877
Two lithium hydroxide canisters, I'm sorry...

1238
01:29:01,936 --> 01:29:04,211
- a roll of gray tape.
- Duct tape.

1239
01:29:04,271 --> 01:29:08,219
Duct tape. You need an LCG bag... Two LCG bags...

1240
01:29:09,043 --> 01:29:12,581
the red suit hoses,
and you've got the flight plan cover.

1241
01:29:18,218 --> 01:29:20,459
What about their level of carbon dioxide?

1242
01:29:20,554 --> 01:29:22,226
It's climbing.

1243
01:29:23,590 --> 01:29:26,366
You're saying
that they're almost out of breathable air?

1244
01:29:26,427 --> 01:29:30,773
Wait a second. That's not what he said.
He said we're working on it.

1245
01:29:31,665 --> 01:29:34,441
You want to cut the duct tape three feet long.

1246
01:29:34,535 --> 01:29:36,708
- Tell him to use his arm.
- Just use your arm.

1247
01:29:36,770 --> 01:29:39,716
- It's an arm's length.
- Okay, I see what you're getting at.

1248
01:29:39,773 --> 01:29:43,015
Jack, tear that piece of tape
down the middle lengthwise.

1249
01:29:43,077 --> 01:29:45,386
- All right?
- Hold on, Houston.

1250
01:29:46,747 --> 01:29:50,285
While the astronauts appear to have
enough oxygen to keep them alive...

1251
01:29:50,384 --> 01:29:53,592
one thing they have
too much of is carbon dioxide.

1252
01:29:53,687 --> 01:29:55,564
With each breath, the three men expel...

1253
01:29:55,622 --> 01:29:58,693
more of the poisonous gas
into the lunar module cockpit...

1254
01:29:58,759 --> 01:30:01,762
and the scrubbers intended
to keep the atmosphere breathable...

1255
01:30:01,862 --> 01:30:04,035
are quickly becoming saturated.

1256
01:30:06,367 --> 01:30:08,210
Oh, shit, I tore it.

1257
01:30:11,572 --> 01:30:15,952
Houston, what do we do
if we ripped the bag? Can we tape it?

1258
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:18,089
- They just tore the bag.
- Oh, no.

1259
01:30:18,145 --> 01:30:22,115
- Stand by. What should I tell them to do?
- They should have one more bag left.

1260
01:30:22,216 --> 01:30:24,923
But they've still got a long way to come...

1261
01:30:24,985 --> 01:30:29,934
and are now working on backup facilities,
their emergency facilities.

1262
01:30:30,090 --> 01:30:33,901
The problem is, if anything more
goes wrong, they're in real trouble.

1263
01:31:03,357 --> 01:31:07,236
As most of you are aware,
there is no rescue possible in space flight.

1264
01:31:07,327 --> 01:31:11,434
Any rescue system the space agency
has long since calculated...

1265
01:31:11,765 --> 01:31:15,371
Any rescue system the space agency calculated...

1266
01:31:20,074 --> 01:31:21,143
One sock.

1267
01:31:21,208 --> 01:31:22,914
Cnce you have the sock in place...

1268
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:25,080
- we're gonna want you...
- Work it in.

1269
01:31:25,179 --> 01:31:28,558
To bungee the entire filter assembly
to the bulkhead...

1270
01:31:28,615 --> 01:31:31,561
- right above the LEM canister.
- We're getting close to 15.

1271
01:31:32,886 --> 01:31:37,630
So how does this flight compare
to other emergency situations you've faced?

1272
01:31:38,392 --> 01:31:41,463
I'll have to say
that this is the most serious situation...

1273
01:31:41,562 --> 01:31:43,974
we've ever encountered in manned space flight.

1274
01:31:44,064 --> 01:31:47,807
- Houston, filter's in place.
- Cabin gas return to egress.

1275
01:31:48,469 --> 01:31:50,778
Suit circuit relief to close.

1276
01:31:50,938 --> 01:31:54,078
- CO2 canister select to secondary.
- All right.

1277
01:31:55,809 --> 01:31:57,219
Here goes.

1278
01:31:58,645 --> 01:32:00,590
I can hear air moving.

1279
01:32:13,494 --> 01:32:15,735
Just breathe normal, fellas.

1280
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:20,440
Aquarius, please advise on CO2 status.

1281
01:32:21,368 --> 01:32:24,576
Houston, we're taking a look
at those numbers now.

1282
01:32:28,408 --> 01:32:31,388
We're still holding close to 15, Houston.

1283
01:32:31,545 --> 01:32:33,581
Roger that. Standing by.

1284
01:32:44,458 --> 01:32:47,803
Houston, the CO2 level has dropped to nine...

1285
01:32:49,196 --> 01:32:51,232
and it is still falling.

1286
01:32:55,869 --> 01:32:58,042
That is good to hear, Aquarius.

1287
01:32:58,105 --> 01:33:01,051
And you, sir, are a steely-eyed missile man.

1288
01:33:05,779 --> 01:33:08,486
Okay, spacecraft control to computer.

1289
01:33:09,516 --> 01:33:10,687
Damn!

1290
01:33:16,290 --> 01:33:17,825
We overloaded.

1291
01:33:18,392 --> 01:33:19,700
We used way too much power.

1292
01:33:19,793 --> 01:33:24,036
There must be a sneak circuit
someplace between step seven and ten.

1293
01:33:24,131 --> 01:33:26,338
All right, which one has the leak?

1294
01:33:27,401 --> 01:33:29,312
I don't know that yet, John.

1295
01:33:29,369 --> 01:33:33,078
The sequence was wrong. We just
have to go back and try them one at a time.

1296
01:33:34,308 --> 01:33:35,878
You need a break, Ken?

1297
01:33:36,076 --> 01:33:38,886
If they don't get one, I don't get one.

1298
01:33:42,916 --> 01:33:45,555
Well, if it won't work, get me another one.

1299
01:33:45,652 --> 01:33:48,894
My son's supposed to be on. I know, Mrs. Lovell.

1300
01:33:48,989 --> 01:33:50,433
Hi, Blanch.

1301
01:33:51,024 --> 01:33:54,027
They can't fix a damn thing in this place.

1302
01:33:54,228 --> 01:33:56,537
Blanch, it's Marilyn.

1303
01:33:57,231 --> 01:33:58,710
Hi, Grandma.

1304
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:01,602
I was gonna see Jimmy.

1305
01:34:01,969 --> 01:34:03,004
I know.

1306
01:34:05,639 --> 01:34:07,982
We came to tell you something.

1307
01:34:08,742 --> 01:34:12,348
There's been an accident.
Jimmy's okay, he's all right.

1308
01:34:14,815 --> 01:34:17,818
But he's not gonna get to walk on the moon.

1309
01:34:18,652 --> 01:34:20,654
Well, they said he was.

1310
01:34:21,288 --> 01:34:23,324
I know.

1311
01:34:25,959 --> 01:34:27,438
That was before.

1312
01:34:27,794 --> 01:34:31,104
Now there's been an explosion,
and they're all okay...

1313
01:34:31,164 --> 01:34:35,203
they're all right.
But now they're just going to...

1314
01:34:36,603 --> 01:34:39,515
try to figure out a way to get them home.

1315
01:34:45,445 --> 01:34:47,857
And it's a little bit dangerous.

1316
01:34:49,316 --> 01:34:50,795
Oh, sweetie.

1317
01:34:54,788 --> 01:34:56,358
Are you scared?

1318
01:35:00,661 --> 01:35:03,038
Well, don't you worry, honey.

1319
01:35:04,097 --> 01:35:07,077
If they could get a washing machine to fly...

1320
01:35:08,602 --> 01:35:10,604
my Jimmy could land it.

1321
01:35:49,843 --> 01:35:53,688
Jack, you'll be happy to hear
we contacted President Nixon...

1322
01:35:54,181 --> 01:35:57,787
and he's gonna grant you
an extension on your income taxes...

1323
01:35:58,018 --> 01:36:01,761
since you are most decidedly out of the country.

1324
01:36:04,024 --> 01:36:05,867
Roger that, Houston.

1325
01:36:06,226 --> 01:36:08,171
That's wonderful news.

1326
01:36:08,228 --> 01:36:10,207
Tell them they have to sleep.

1327
01:36:10,263 --> 01:36:12,709
Haise is running a fever of 104.

1328
01:36:13,066 --> 01:36:16,672
13, we've got another request
from the flight surgeon...

1329
01:36:16,737 --> 01:36:18,773
that you fellas get some more sleep.

1330
01:36:18,872 --> 01:36:21,682
He doesn't like his readings down here.

1331
01:36:22,042 --> 01:36:24,044
Let's see how he feels about this.

1332
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:27,456
I am sick and tired
of the entire western world...

1333
01:36:27,914 --> 01:36:31,088
knowing how my kidneys are functioning!

1334
01:36:35,589 --> 01:36:37,762
Flight, I just lost Lovell.

1335
01:36:42,429 --> 01:36:44,306
13, this is Houston.

1336
01:36:44,798 --> 01:36:48,245
Jim, we just had a dropout
on your bio-med sensors.

1337
01:36:48,635 --> 01:36:51,240
I'm not wearing my bio-med sensors, Houston.

1338
01:37:01,848 --> 01:37:04,123
Okay, Jim. Copy that.

1339
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:22,303
Now I'm losing all three of them!

1340
01:37:22,969 --> 01:37:25,608
It's just a little medical mutiny, Doc.

1341
01:37:26,072 --> 01:37:28,381
I'm sure the guys are still with us.

1342
01:37:29,376 --> 01:37:31,822
Let's cut them some slack, okay?

1343
01:37:43,423 --> 01:37:46,369
Gene, it's not the velocity, it's the angle.

1344
01:37:46,927 --> 01:37:50,875
Maybe they're still venting something
and that's throwing off the trajectory...

1345
01:37:50,931 --> 01:37:52,740
but we are definitely shallowing again.

1346
01:37:52,833 --> 01:37:55,609
- We are up to a 5.9.
- Damn it.

1347
01:37:55,702 --> 01:37:59,274
At this rate, they nick the atmosphere
and bounce off into space.

1348
01:37:59,372 --> 01:38:01,408
We need another burn to get them back.

1349
01:38:01,475 --> 01:38:04,080
- Another burn.
- Fire the engines, get them on course.

1350
01:38:04,144 --> 01:38:05,179
Copy that.

1351
01:38:25,765 --> 01:38:27,869
Aquarius, this is Houston.

1352
01:38:29,002 --> 01:38:30,378
Houston, Aquarius.

1353
01:38:31,538 --> 01:38:34,314
Jim, we've got another course correction for you.

1354
01:38:34,774 --> 01:38:36,150
What's up?

1355
01:38:36,877 --> 01:38:39,050
Something about another course correction.

1356
01:38:39,145 --> 01:38:41,284
We copy, Houston.

1357
01:38:42,482 --> 01:38:46,293
Be advised, it's gonna take Freddo and I
a while to power up the computer...

1358
01:38:46,353 --> 01:38:49,959
for the alignment platform
if we have to fire the engine.

1359
01:38:50,023 --> 01:38:54,198
Negative on that, Jim.
We can't spare power for the computer.

1360
01:38:55,562 --> 01:38:57,200
We gotta do this blind?

1361
01:38:57,297 --> 01:39:00,801
Houston, without the computer,
what do we use for orientation?

1362
01:39:01,234 --> 01:39:04,112
Come on, we gotta be able
to give these guys something.

1363
01:39:04,204 --> 01:39:05,546
Without the power, we can't give them a reading.

1364
01:39:06,773 --> 01:39:08,809
Not power. I'm talking about reference.

1365
01:39:08,909 --> 01:39:11,980
- No, there's no references.
- We have a bunch of debris up there...

1366
01:39:12,078 --> 01:39:14,990
Houston, what's the story with this burn?

1367
01:39:15,282 --> 01:39:18,228
We're trying to hash
something out down here, Aquarius.

1368
01:39:18,485 --> 01:39:19,827
Stand by.

1369
01:39:20,487 --> 01:39:25,094
Look, Houston, all we need to hold attitude
is one fixed point in space.

1370
01:39:25,725 --> 01:39:28,796
- Ls that not correct?
- Yeah. Roger that, Jim.

1371
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:35,504
Well, Houston, we've got one.

1372
01:39:36,169 --> 01:39:39,206
If we can keep the Earth
in the window, flying manually...

1373
01:39:39,706 --> 01:39:42,277
the crosshairs right on its terminator...

1374
01:39:42,375 --> 01:39:45,617
all I have to know is,
how long do we need to burn the engine?

1375
01:39:45,712 --> 01:39:48,692
- The shorter, the better.
- Roger that, Jim.

1376
01:39:48,882 --> 01:39:51,760
Can they fly it manually
and still shut it down on time...

1377
01:39:51,851 --> 01:39:53,261
without the computer?

1378
01:39:56,423 --> 01:39:58,266
I guess that's the best we can do.

1379
01:39:58,358 --> 01:39:59,893
We're out of time.

1380
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:02,201
In order to enter the atmosphere safely...

1381
01:40:02,262 --> 01:40:05,572
the crew must aim for a corridor
just two-and-a-half degrees wide.

1382
01:40:05,632 --> 01:40:09,238
If they're too steep, they'll incinerate
in the steadily thickening air.

1383
01:40:09,302 --> 01:40:12,305
If they're too shallow,
they'll ricochet off the atmosphere...

1384
01:40:12,405 --> 01:40:13,781
like a rock skipping off a pond.

1385
01:40:13,873 --> 01:40:18,378
The re-entry corridor is, in fact, so narrow
that if this basketball were the Earth...

1386
01:40:18,445 --> 01:40:22,620
and this softball were the moon,
and the two were placed 14 feet apart...

1387
01:40:22,816 --> 01:40:26,991
the crew would have to hit a target
no thicker than this piece of paper.

1388
01:40:27,087 --> 01:40:29,567
On your toes. We're doing this one blind.

1389
01:40:29,623 --> 01:40:32,262
Gene, understand
that we've never tried this before:

1390
01:40:32,325 --> 01:40:36,329
Burn, cold soak, burn, cold soak,
burn, manual control.

1391
01:40:36,429 --> 01:40:38,340
Look, it will ignite, will it not?

1392
01:40:38,431 --> 01:40:42,003
I just want you to know
the engine's never been tried like this.

1393
01:40:42,102 --> 01:40:44,514
That's all I'm trying to tell you.

1394
01:40:44,604 --> 01:40:48,916
I know what you're trying to do. I guarantee
I won't hold you personally responsible.

1395
01:40:48,975 --> 01:40:52,251
If it lights, it lights. Let Lovell do the rest.

1396
01:40:53,013 --> 01:40:54,184
Okay.

1397
01:40:54,581 --> 01:40:56,856
They'll burn the engine and steer manually...

1398
01:40:56,916 --> 01:40:59,521
attempting to keep the Earth in the window.

1399
01:41:06,826 --> 01:41:09,067
Okay, this is gonna take all three of us.

1400
01:41:09,829 --> 01:41:13,572
Freddo, you handle the pitch.

1401
01:41:14,067 --> 01:41:16,638
Put on the translation controllers,
all backwards...

1402
01:41:16,736 --> 01:41:19,807
so if the Earth starts drifting down...

1403
01:41:19,873 --> 01:41:23,081
you need to thrust aft, not forward.

1404
01:41:23,410 --> 01:41:26,083
I'll do the same on mine with everything else.

1405
01:41:26,246 --> 01:41:29,659
We're going to burn at 10% thrust
for 39 seconds. Jack, you time us.

1406
01:41:29,749 --> 01:41:30,852
Got it.

1407
01:41:31,184 --> 01:41:35,154
Give us a count of the last 10 seconds
up to 39. Let's not miss this.

1408
01:41:38,792 --> 01:41:40,794
You up to this, Freddo?

1409
01:41:42,696 --> 01:41:44,197
I'm with you.

1410
01:41:44,964 --> 01:41:48,104
Standing by for corridor control burn.

1411
01:41:48,168 --> 01:41:50,773
Okay, Jim, you can fire when ready.

1412
01:41:51,004 --> 01:41:53,347
You are go for the manual burn.

1413
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:56,887
Okay, X-plus button at 10 seconds. Mark.

1414
01:41:57,110 --> 01:41:59,852
- Come on, baby. One more burn.
- Nine, eight...

1415
01:42:00,046 --> 01:42:02,549
seven, six, five...

1416
01:42:02,649 --> 01:42:04,890
- four, three...
- Ullage is go.

1417
01:42:04,984 --> 01:42:07,555
Two, one, ignition!

1418
01:42:09,489 --> 01:42:11,024
She's burning!

1419
01:42:11,324 --> 01:42:14,100
- Master arm off.
- Okay, here we go.

1420
01:42:14,227 --> 01:42:17,503
- Helium regulator on.
- RCS is go, 10% thrust.

1421
01:42:18,198 --> 01:42:21,668
Bring her around, Freddo.
I'm trying but it's dragging.

1422
01:42:22,068 --> 01:42:24,775
- Ten seconds.
- Drop it down, Freddo.

1423
01:42:24,871 --> 01:42:26,782
- We're drifting!
- No, hold what you got.

1424
01:42:26,873 --> 01:42:29,114
- I'll roll it. Back off.
- Can't get it stable.

1425
01:42:29,209 --> 01:42:31,689
She's dancing all over the place!

1426
01:42:31,745 --> 01:42:34,623
- Come to the right a little bit.
- Fifteen seconds.

1427
01:42:34,748 --> 01:42:36,921
She's drifting. I'm losing attitude.

1428
01:42:37,016 --> 01:42:39,587
Hold it right there. That's it. No, Freddo, back!

1429
01:42:39,686 --> 01:42:41,927
- Shit! I'm losing it!
- Bring the Earth up.

1430
01:42:42,021 --> 01:42:44,364
Thrust forward, Fred. Come on.

1431
01:42:44,991 --> 01:42:47,835
Shit, I lost it! Where is it?

1432
01:42:47,894 --> 01:42:49,930
7:00. Helium regulator's closed.

1433
01:42:50,597 --> 01:42:52,736
Bring it down, Freddo. Just nose it down.

1434
01:42:52,832 --> 01:42:54,572
- Okay, I got it!
- Thirty seconds.

1435
01:42:54,667 --> 01:42:56,703
Little farther. Ease your touch!

1436
01:42:58,004 --> 01:43:00,882
Damn it, that's mine. That's me. Around.

1437
01:43:02,842 --> 01:43:05,913
- A little more. Come on, baby.
- That's it. Hold it.

1438
01:43:05,979 --> 01:43:09,016
Back! That's it! Hold it! Steady... Eight, nine!

1439
01:43:09,115 --> 01:43:10,457
Shutdown!

1440
01:43:21,327 --> 01:43:23,329
Houston, we have shutdown.

1441
01:43:23,429 --> 01:43:26,068
That's close enough, Jim. Good work.

1442
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:30,748
I knew it! How about that LEM! How about it?

1443
01:43:32,572 --> 01:43:35,052
- Guess you can keep your job.
- You betcha.

1444
01:43:35,108 --> 01:43:39,056
13, stand by. We're evaluating
our power usage on that burn.

1445
01:43:40,914 --> 01:43:43,257
Let's hope we don't have to do that again.

1446
01:43:57,163 --> 01:44:01,406
Gentlemen, you've given our guys
enough to survive till re-entry.

1447
01:44:02,702 --> 01:44:04,078
Well done.

1448
01:44:07,507 --> 01:44:10,852
Now we gotta get them in,
so tell me about the power-up procedures.

1449
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:13,390
Here's the order of what I want to do.

1450
01:44:13,446 --> 01:44:17,291
I want to power up guidance,
ECS, communications...

1451
01:44:18,117 --> 01:44:22,224
warm up the pyros for the parachutes
and the command module thrusters.

1452
01:44:22,455 --> 01:44:25,197
The thrusters will put you over budget on amps.

1453
01:44:25,358 --> 01:44:29,362
They've been sitting at 200 below
for four days. They gotta be heated.

1454
01:44:29,429 --> 01:44:31,431
Fine. Then trade off the parachutes.

1455
01:44:31,865 --> 01:44:35,778
- If the chutes don't open, what's the point?
- You're telling me what you need.

1456
01:44:35,869 --> 01:44:39,646
I'm telling you what we have to work with.
I'm not making this stuff up.

1457
01:44:39,739 --> 01:44:41,809
They're going to need all these systems.

1458
01:44:41,908 --> 01:44:45,412
We do not have the power, Ken.
We just don't have it.

1459
01:44:49,082 --> 01:44:52,825
I'll reorganize the sequencing again
and find more power.

1460
01:44:53,319 --> 01:44:56,299
Let's start from scratch. Clear the board.

1461
01:44:59,592 --> 01:45:01,969
I don't know where the hell we'll find it.

1462
01:45:02,829 --> 01:45:06,367
Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell
has more time in space...

1463
01:45:06,466 --> 01:45:09,344
almost 24 days already, than any other man...

1464
01:45:09,402 --> 01:45:12,041
and I asked him recently if he ever was scared.

1465
01:45:12,138 --> 01:45:15,312
I've had an engine flame out
a few times in an aircraft...

1466
01:45:15,375 --> 01:45:20,290
and was curious as to whether it was going
to light up again, things of that nature...

1467
01:45:20,346 --> 01:45:22,450
but they seem to work out.

1468
01:45:23,149 --> 01:45:24,355
Is there an instance...

1469
01:45:24,417 --> 01:45:27,659
in an airplane emergency
when you can recall fear?

1470
01:45:29,022 --> 01:45:31,900
Well, I remember this one time...

1471
01:45:31,991 --> 01:45:35,802
in a Banshee at night in combat conditions,
so the carrier has no lights.

1472
01:45:35,862 --> 01:45:38,501
It wes the Shangri-la.
We were in the Sea of Japan.

1473
01:45:38,564 --> 01:45:42,204
My radar had jammed,
and my homing signal was gone...

1474
01:45:42,302 --> 01:45:45,681
because somebody in Japan
was using the same frequency...

1475
01:45:46,072 --> 01:45:49,314
and so it was leading me away
from where I was supposed to be.

1476
01:45:49,742 --> 01:45:54,657
I'm looking down at a big, black ocean,
so I flip on my map light.

1477
01:45:55,081 --> 01:45:58,756
Then, suddenly, zap! Everything shorts out
right there in my cockpit.

1478
01:45:58,851 --> 01:46:03,129
All my instruments and lights are gone,
I can't even tell what my altitude is.

1479
01:46:03,923 --> 01:46:08,496
I know I'm running out of fuel,
so I'm thinking about ditching in the ocean.

1480
01:46:09,062 --> 01:46:12,168
I look down there, and then in the darkness...

1481
01:46:12,265 --> 01:46:14,904
there's this green trail.

1482
01:46:15,068 --> 01:46:19,482
It's like a long carpet that's just laid
out beneath me. It was the algae!

1483
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:24,679
It was that phosphorescent stuff that gets
churned up in the wake of a big ship.

1484
01:46:24,777 --> 01:46:27,018
It was just leading me home.

1485
01:46:27,313 --> 01:46:30,419
And if my cockpit lights hadn't shorted out...

1486
01:46:30,483 --> 01:46:32,792
there's no way
I'd have ever been able to see that.

1487
01:46:32,852 --> 01:46:35,423
So, you never know...

1488
01:46:35,521 --> 01:46:38,968
what events are going to transpire
to get you home.

1489
01:46:43,763 --> 01:46:47,676
Spacecraft commander
Jim Lovell, no stranger to emergency is he.

1490
01:46:58,845 --> 01:47:01,552
- How's it going, Fred?
- I'm okay.

1491
01:47:03,950 --> 01:47:05,690
What the hell was that?

1492
01:47:06,586 --> 01:47:08,895
Let's hope it was just the burst disk.

1493
01:47:08,955 --> 01:47:13,028
- Can you confirm a burst helium disk?
- Wo confirm that.

1494
01:47:13,192 --> 01:47:16,867
Houston, is that going to affect
our entry angle at all?

1495
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:20,706
Negative. Your entry angle
is holding at 6.24, Aquarius.

1496
01:47:21,434 --> 01:47:22,810
Houston...

1497
01:47:24,804 --> 01:47:28,911
we sure could use the re-entry procedure up here.

1498
01:47:29,809 --> 01:47:31,879
When can we expect that?

1499
01:47:34,247 --> 01:47:36,590
That's coming real soon, Aquarius.

1500
01:47:36,649 --> 01:47:38,253
Houston, we...

1501
01:47:39,218 --> 01:47:42,324
We just can't throw this together
at the last minute.

1502
01:47:42,455 --> 01:47:44,832
So, here's what you're gonna do.

1503
01:47:45,124 --> 01:47:48,799
You're gonna get the procedure up to us,
whatever it is...

1504
01:47:48,995 --> 01:47:53,136
and we're gonna go over it step by step,
so there's no foul-ups.

1505
01:47:54,233 --> 01:47:57,077
I don't have to tell you
we're all a little tired up here.

1506
01:47:57,170 --> 01:47:59,946
The world's getting awfully big in the window.

1507
01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:02,651
- Jim, this is Deke.
- It's Deke.

1508
01:48:03,076 --> 01:48:05,351
They don't know how to do it.

1509
01:48:05,878 --> 01:48:07,482
Maybe Jack's right.

1510
01:48:09,048 --> 01:48:10,925
Hello, Deke. What's the story?

1511
01:48:11,017 --> 01:48:14,987
We're gonna get that procedure to you
as soon as we possibly can.

1512
01:48:15,088 --> 01:48:17,465
Ken Mattingly's in the simulator right now.

1513
01:48:18,791 --> 01:48:20,634
Ken's working on it?

1514
01:48:24,363 --> 01:48:27,935
Look, I know this sequence works, John.

1515
01:48:28,067 --> 01:48:30,809
It looks good.
We're just over budget on the amperage.

1516
01:48:30,903 --> 01:48:33,246
- By how much?
- Three or four amps.

1517
01:48:33,306 --> 01:48:35,445
God damn it, John! Is it three or four?

1518
01:48:35,608 --> 01:48:37,087
- Four.
- Four!

1519
01:48:38,744 --> 01:48:40,314
Four more amps.

1520
01:48:50,990 --> 01:48:53,800
They have some power left
in the LEM batteries, right?

1521
01:48:53,926 --> 01:48:55,097
Yeah.

1522
01:48:56,395 --> 01:49:00,434
We have an umbilical that provides power
from the command module to the LEM.

1523
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:04,072
- It's backup for the LEM power supply.
- I'm listening.

1524
01:49:04,504 --> 01:49:09,146
So reverse it. Reverse the flow
and see if we can draw these four amps...

1525
01:49:09,208 --> 01:49:12,086
from the LEM before we cut it loose.
Why can't we do that?

1526
01:49:13,646 --> 01:49:17,252
- We don't have a procedure for that?
- You'll lose a lot in the transfer.

1527
01:49:17,350 --> 01:49:20,820
Yeah. But all we're talking about here
is four amps.

1528
01:49:22,021 --> 01:49:24,694
I want whatever you guys got
on these power procedures.

1529
01:49:24,757 --> 01:49:27,703
- Gene, they're already...
- Not all, just part.

1530
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:30,706
- We've got to give them something.
- They're working on it.

1531
01:49:30,763 --> 01:49:32,867
- I'll get an estimate.
- God damn it!

1532
01:49:32,932 --> 01:49:37,175
I don't want another estimate!
I want the procedures now!

1533
01:49:49,615 --> 01:49:51,025
LMU is up.

1534
01:49:52,285 --> 01:49:54,924
- How am I reading?
- Fine, so far.

1535
01:49:55,121 --> 01:49:57,726
- Say again.
- You're under the limit. Keep going.

1536
01:49:58,724 --> 01:50:00,863
Okay. Floodlights to fixed.

1537
01:50:02,762 --> 01:50:05,299
Okay, I'm bringing up the guidance.

1538
01:50:08,034 --> 01:50:09,410
Here we go.

1539
01:50:10,937 --> 01:50:12,643
CMC Attitude lMU.

1540
01:50:13,806 --> 01:50:15,250
CMC source.

1541
01:50:16,142 --> 01:50:19,248
CMC mode, auto, and we're on the computer.

1542
01:50:30,323 --> 01:50:32,928
Go ahead. Ls your computer on now?

1543
01:50:33,659 --> 01:50:35,468
Up and running.

1544
01:50:36,295 --> 01:50:37,774
How do we look?

1545
01:50:47,273 --> 01:50:49,343
I think we got it, buddy.

1546
01:50:59,485 --> 01:51:03,091
Arthur, my notes are clear
on that last sequence, right?

1547
01:51:03,322 --> 01:51:06,428
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I was getting a little blurry there.

1548
01:51:09,695 --> 01:51:11,731
Here's Ken. Here's John.

1549
01:51:12,598 --> 01:51:14,702
It's good to see you, Ken.

1550
01:51:15,101 --> 01:51:16,375
This is the sequence.

1551
01:51:16,435 --> 01:51:19,677
- Was it tried on the hardware yet?
- We didn't have time.

1552
01:51:20,706 --> 01:51:23,049
Aquarius, Houston. Do you read?

1553
01:51:24,043 --> 01:51:26,045
Yeah, we read you, Ken.

1554
01:51:28,114 --> 01:51:30,719
Are the flowers blooming in Houston?

1555
01:51:30,783 --> 01:51:34,594
That's a negative, Jim. I don't have the measles.

1556
01:51:39,258 --> 01:51:41,362
Jim, is Jack in there with you?

1557
01:51:41,761 --> 01:51:44,639
Yeah, stand by one. We gotta get him on comm.

1558
01:51:44,730 --> 01:51:47,642
- Put those on the table.
- Damn it. Thanks, Jackie.

1559
01:51:47,733 --> 01:51:50,076
I think it would really help if you could...

1560
01:51:50,136 --> 01:51:54,550
just distract her
when the heavy predictions come in.

1561
01:51:55,574 --> 01:51:57,713
- We'll give it a shot.
- Thanks.

1562
01:51:59,879 --> 01:52:03,485
Blanch, these nice, young men
are gonna watch television with you.

1563
01:52:03,549 --> 01:52:07,224
- This is Neil Armstrong, and this is Buzz.
- Nice to meet you.

1564
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:11,393
- Hi.
- Are you boys in the space program, too?

1565
01:52:13,125 --> 01:52:16,731
Okay, Jack, give me a read-back
on that last procedure.

1566
01:52:17,029 --> 01:52:18,564
Stand by, Ken.

1567
01:52:22,335 --> 01:52:26,578
Ken, I'm having trouble reading my own writing.

1568
01:52:26,672 --> 01:52:29,982
I guess I was a little more tired than I thought.

1569
01:52:35,014 --> 01:52:37,653
Don't worry, Jack. I'll talk you through it.

1570
01:52:40,419 --> 01:52:43,229
Find the main bus breakers on panel 11.

1571
01:52:45,758 --> 01:52:47,601
Yeah, main bus breakers. Got it.

1572
01:52:47,827 --> 01:52:49,328
Close main bus B.

1573
01:52:57,503 --> 01:53:01,280
Ken, there's an awful lot of condensation
on these panels.

1574
01:53:01,607 --> 01:53:04,314
What's the word on these things shorting out?

1575
01:53:08,647 --> 01:53:11,525
We'll just take that one at a time, Jack.

1576
01:53:13,986 --> 01:53:17,626
It's like trying to drive a toaster
through a car wash.

1577
01:53:25,197 --> 01:53:27,108
Main bus B is closed.

1578
01:53:27,166 --> 01:53:29,771
13, we're coming up on entry interface.

1579
01:53:29,835 --> 01:53:33,475
Flight, we're still shallowing up a bit
in the re-entry corridor.

1580
01:53:33,539 --> 01:53:35,712
It's almost like they're underweight.

1581
01:53:35,841 --> 01:53:39,151
- Now how could they be underweight?
- We didn't land on the moon.

1582
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:42,825
- Rocks?
- That's affirm.

1583
01:53:43,816 --> 01:53:45,260
One more thing, Jim.

1584
01:53:45,317 --> 01:53:48,297
While Jack's working on the power-up,
we want you and Freddo...

1585
01:53:48,354 --> 01:53:50,857
to transfer some ballast
over to the command module.

1586
01:53:50,956 --> 01:53:52,833
Say again, Houston. Ballast?

1587
01:53:53,459 --> 01:53:56,337
That's affirm. We got to get the weight right.

1588
01:53:56,395 --> 01:54:00,035
We were expecting you to be toting
a couple hundred pounds of moon rocks.

1589
01:54:00,132 --> 01:54:01,474
Right, Houston.

1590
01:54:01,867 --> 01:54:04,040
- Now, Jack.
- Yeah, go ahead, Ken.

1591
01:54:04,136 --> 01:54:06,411
Okay, now, panel five.

1592
01:54:07,072 --> 01:54:11,884
Circuit breaker caution
and warning main B closed.

1593
01:54:12,211 --> 01:54:13,917
Main B closed.

1594
01:54:15,414 --> 01:54:17,120
Master alarm off.

1595
01:54:17,316 --> 01:54:21,423
Okay, Jack, on panel seven,
b-mag number two, power to warm-up.

1596
01:54:21,654 --> 01:54:24,259
B-mag number two, power to warm-up. Done.

1597
01:54:24,590 --> 01:54:27,002
Sequential logic one and two on.

1598
01:54:27,293 --> 01:54:30,171
Sequential logic, two on.

1599
01:54:30,463 --> 01:54:32,840
CMRCS pressure, on.

1600
01:54:33,399 --> 01:54:35,173
CMRCS pressurization.

1601
01:54:35,267 --> 01:54:38,771
As her husband prepares
to jettison his lunar module lifeboat...

1602
01:54:38,838 --> 01:54:41,682
Marilyn Lovell waits
with her children, her neighbors...

1603
01:54:41,774 --> 01:54:46,245
and, we are told, Apollo 11 astronauts
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.

1604
01:54:46,612 --> 01:54:49,422
Only the Lovells' eldest son, Jay, is absent...

1605
01:54:49,515 --> 01:54:51,688
as he holds vigil with his classmates...

1606
01:54:51,784 --> 01:54:54,958
at the St. John's Military Academy in Wisconsin.

1607
01:54:55,120 --> 01:54:57,827
ABC News science editor Jules Bergman.

1608
01:54:58,023 --> 01:55:01,766
With a crippled command module,
and surviving by using the LEM's systems...

1609
01:55:01,927 --> 01:55:03,872
there can be no easy maneuver.

1610
01:55:03,929 --> 01:55:07,205
Their LEM lifeboat is doing things
and working longer...

1611
01:55:07,266 --> 01:55:08,836
than it was ever intended to.

1612
01:55:08,901 --> 01:55:11,347
It's a race against time until splashdown...

1613
01:55:11,604 --> 01:55:14,380
We're ready fo see if the computer will accept...

1614
01:55:14,440 --> 01:55:16,749
uplink of the re-entry data now.

1615
01:55:18,077 --> 01:55:19,385
Okay, the lMU is up.

1616
01:55:19,445 --> 01:55:22,187
- We got our eight-balls back.
- Copy that.

1617
01:55:22,248 --> 01:55:26,958
Okay, Ken, uplink telemetry,
command module to accept, right?

1618
01:55:27,553 --> 01:55:30,090
That's affirm. Go ahead and try it.

1619
01:55:50,809 --> 01:55:52,549
Uplink completed.

1620
01:55:58,150 --> 01:56:00,823
- That's more like it.
- Okay, let's go.

1621
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:03,161
Take a look at your amps. How we doing?

1622
01:56:06,125 --> 01:56:08,036
We got her back up, Ken.

1623
01:56:08,494 --> 01:56:10,496
Boy, I wish you were here to see it.

1624
01:56:10,563 --> 01:56:12,235
I'll bet you do.

1625
01:56:15,467 --> 01:56:17,139
Way to go, Jack.

1626
01:56:22,207 --> 01:56:24,311
- Flight, this is RETRO.
- Go, RETRC.

1627
01:56:24,643 --> 01:56:27,146
Flight, we have a typhoon warning...

1628
01:56:27,246 --> 01:56:30,352
- on the edge of the prime recovery zone.
- Say again, RETRO.

1629
01:56:30,416 --> 01:56:32,725
We're looking at a typhoon warning...

1630
01:56:32,785 --> 01:56:34,594
on the edge of the prime recovery area.

1631
01:56:34,653 --> 01:56:37,326
This is just a warning. It could miss them.

1632
01:56:37,389 --> 01:56:39,562
Only if their luck changes.

1633
01:56:39,758 --> 01:56:42,261
Jim, we're ready for SM jettison!

1634
01:56:43,062 --> 01:56:45,201
All right, Jack, on three!

1635
01:56:46,498 --> 01:56:48,409
One, two...

1636
01:56:49,168 --> 01:56:51,875
- Upward thrust.
- We're loose!

1637
01:56:52,705 --> 01:56:54,377
Reverse thrust!

1638
01:56:54,640 --> 01:56:56,949
We have service module jettison.

1639
01:56:57,009 --> 01:56:59,716
Okay, Houston, service module is free.

1640
01:57:00,079 --> 01:57:02,252
We'll take a look at what we have here.

1641
01:57:02,448 --> 01:57:03,824
Copy that.

1642
01:57:07,987 --> 01:57:09,932
There it is. I see it!

1643
01:57:13,592 --> 01:57:16,834
Houston, we're getting our first look
at the service module now.

1644
01:57:16,929 --> 01:57:19,671
One whole side of the spacecraft is missing.

1645
01:57:21,100 --> 01:57:24,945
Right by the high gain antenna
a whole panel is blown out...

1646
01:57:25,471 --> 01:57:28,178
right up to our heat shield.

1647
01:57:29,642 --> 01:57:31,485
Copy that, Aquarius.

1648
01:57:31,543 --> 01:57:35,047
It looked like it got the engine bell, too.
Can you see that?

1649
01:57:38,951 --> 01:57:41,124
Oh, man, that's incredible.

1650
01:57:44,490 --> 01:57:45,730
The heat shield.

1651
01:57:45,824 --> 01:57:50,466
The heat will build up to as
much as 3,000 or 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

1652
01:57:51,797 --> 01:57:53,799
On a lunar re-entry flight, the heat...

1653
01:57:53,866 --> 01:57:55,345
So, Blanch?

1654
01:57:57,236 --> 01:58:00,012
Did Jim make Eagle Scout or not?

1655
01:58:00,172 --> 01:58:01,912
- Yes, he did.
- He did.

1656
01:58:01,974 --> 01:58:04,181
If the heat shield is even slightly cracked...

1657
01:58:04,243 --> 01:58:06,916
the extreme cold could've split it wide open.

1658
01:58:07,212 --> 01:58:10,386
Worst of all, if the pyrotechnics
that control the parachutes...

1659
01:58:10,449 --> 01:58:13,225
have been damaged,
the chutes may not open at all...

1660
01:58:13,318 --> 01:58:17,163
causing the spacecraft to hit the water
not at a gentle 20 miles per hour...

1661
01:58:17,423 --> 01:58:19,334
but at a suicidal 300.

1662
01:58:19,758 --> 01:58:21,669
Perbaps never in human history...

1663
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:25,264
has the entire world been united
by such a global drama.

1664
01:58:25,397 --> 01:58:28,002
In New York City,
thousands of people have gathered...

1665
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:30,773
to watch updates of the mission in Times Square.

1666
01:58:30,836 --> 01:58:33,816
Many countries offered help
and the State Department said...

1667
01:58:33,906 --> 01:58:35,851
it would ask for it if it were needed.

1668
01:58:35,941 --> 01:58:39,251
The House and Senate passed resolutions
calling on the people...

1669
01:58:39,311 --> 01:58:41,415
to pray tonight for the astronauts.

1670
01:58:41,513 --> 01:58:43,117
In Rome, Pope Paul led...

1671
01:58:43,515 --> 01:58:47,292
50,000 people in prayers
for the safe return of the astronauts.

1672
01:58:47,519 --> 01:58:50,261
In Jerusalem, prayers at the Wailing Wall...

1673
01:58:56,095 --> 01:58:59,007
it's about time to bail out of this ship.

1674
01:59:06,338 --> 01:59:07,680
You okay?

1675
01:59:09,408 --> 01:59:10,909
I'm freezing.

1676
01:59:13,412 --> 01:59:16,051
Can you hold out just a little longer?

1677
01:59:16,482 --> 01:59:18,723
- Long as I have to.
- Come on.

1678
01:59:19,651 --> 01:59:23,064
It won't be long. Just a little while longer.

1679
01:59:25,657 --> 01:59:30,435
Just a little while longer. We're gonna hit
that water in the South Pacific.

1680
01:59:31,263 --> 01:59:33,072
Open up that hatch.

1681
01:59:34,333 --> 01:59:37,211
- It's 80 degrees out there.
- 80 degrees.

1682
01:59:40,105 --> 01:59:43,518
- You are a mess.
- Yeah.

1683
01:59:45,544 --> 01:59:48,251
Odyssey, Houston. How we doing, guys?

1684
01:59:48,347 --> 01:59:50,588
We're closing in on lunar module jettison.

1685
01:59:50,682 --> 01:59:52,889
As you know, that is time critical.

1686
01:59:52,951 --> 01:59:55,556
You should be moving into the command module.

1687
01:59:55,621 --> 01:59:57,259
Let's get that hatch buttoned up...

1688
01:59:57,356 --> 02:00:00,132
and when you get a chance,
let us know how you're doing.

1689
02:00:00,359 --> 02:00:01,769
Roger that.

1690
02:00:04,897 --> 02:00:07,240
Let me give you a hand there, Freddo.

1691
02:00:42,401 --> 02:00:44,813
We're coming up on LEM jettison.

1692
02:00:45,137 --> 02:00:47,913
Is everyone strapped in, Ken?
We're getting real close.

1693
02:00:47,973 --> 02:00:52,285
Copy that, Flight. 13, Houston.
We're coming up on LEM jettison.

1694
02:00:52,778 --> 02:00:54,120
Stand by.

1695
02:00:55,480 --> 02:00:57,516
Have you got everybody in the Odyssey?

1696
02:00:57,616 --> 02:01:00,926
Yeah, Ken, I'm gonna check
those pyro batteries one more time here.

1697
02:01:02,421 --> 02:01:06,733
The pyro batts look good. I don't think
we have to tie the other batteries.

1698
02:01:19,271 --> 02:01:21,683
Sorry, Jack, this is an old habit.

1699
02:01:21,740 --> 02:01:25,050
I'm kind of used to the pilot's seat.
She's yours to fly.

1700
02:01:30,415 --> 02:01:33,885
Odyssey, I want to double check
some re-entry procedures...

1701
02:01:33,952 --> 02:01:37,865
right after we jettison the LEM,
which is coming up in 30 seconds.

1702
02:01:38,757 --> 02:01:40,258
What is that?

1703
02:01:41,793 --> 02:01:43,397
I was getting a little punchy...

1704
02:01:43,462 --> 02:01:47,205
and I didn't want to cut the LEM loose
with you guys still in it.

1705
02:01:48,433 --> 02:01:50,310
That's good thinking.

1706
02:01:52,371 --> 02:01:54,111
Stand by, Houston.

1707
02:01:56,775 --> 02:01:59,118
We have lunar module jettison.

1708
02:02:06,985 --> 02:02:09,055
She sure was a good ship.

1709
02:02:10,489 --> 02:02:13,697
Farewell, Aquarius, and we thank you.

1710
02:02:24,303 --> 02:02:26,339
It's almost time, honey.

1711
02:02:29,808 --> 02:02:31,912
Flight 966406.

1712
02:02:52,564 --> 02:02:54,099
Let me put it this way.

1713
02:02:54,166 --> 02:02:57,010
The trajectory may be off.
Their thrusters may be frozen.

1714
02:02:57,069 --> 02:02:59,242
Their guidance system might be malfunctioning.

1715
02:02:59,338 --> 02:03:01,078
Their heat shield could be cracked.

1716
02:03:01,173 --> 02:03:04,176
And their parachutes
might be three blocks of ice.

1717
02:03:04,276 --> 02:03:06,312
Clearly, we have some obstacles to overcome.

1718
02:03:06,411 --> 02:03:09,482
But now I'm asking you, when will we know?

1719
02:03:10,549 --> 02:03:15,259
Blackout lasts for three minutes.
If they're not back in four, we'll know.

1720
02:03:16,455 --> 02:03:20,300
Velocity now reading 34,802 feet per second.

1721
02:03:20,425 --> 02:03:23,633
- Range to go 2,625 nautical miles.
- Copy that.

1722
02:03:24,363 --> 02:03:29,175
Okay, Ken, we are aligned for re-entry. Jim,
we need that computer re-entry program.

1723
02:03:29,267 --> 02:03:32,145
- Fred, how are the batteries looking?
- Okay.

1724
02:03:33,005 --> 02:03:36,145
Batt A looks good.
Re-entry interface in one minute...

1725
02:03:36,208 --> 02:03:39,848
- Batt B, no volts, the amps are okay.
- And 30 seconds.

1726
02:03:40,979 --> 02:03:42,321
Batt C...

1727
02:03:43,348 --> 02:03:45,384
No volts, only two amps.

1728
02:03:46,618 --> 02:03:49,189
It may die before the main chutes open.

1729
02:03:49,488 --> 02:03:52,400
Roger. Let's tie all the batteries
onto main A and main B.

1730
02:03:52,491 --> 02:03:56,029
They're still shallowing a bit up there.
Do you want to tell them?

1731
02:03:56,795 --> 02:03:59,571
- Is there anything we can do about it?
- Not now, Flight.

1732
02:03:59,664 --> 02:04:02,303
- Then they don't need to know, do they?
- Copy that.

1733
02:04:02,401 --> 02:04:05,973
RETRO says the typhoon
is still a presence in the splashdown area?

1734
02:04:06,071 --> 02:04:08,949
We got the parachute situation...

1735
02:04:09,041 --> 02:04:11,544
heat shield, angle of trajectory, and a typhoon.

1736
02:04:11,610 --> 02:04:15,455
- There are so many variables, I'm at a loss...
- I know what the problems are.

1737
02:04:15,614 --> 02:04:18,617
This could be the worst disaster
NASA has experienced.

1738
02:04:18,717 --> 02:04:23,324
With all due respect, sir,
I believe this is going to be our finest hour.

1739
02:04:36,268 --> 02:04:38,907
Expect entry interface in 45 seconds.

1740
02:04:39,805 --> 02:04:41,944
And on my mark, your velocity...

1741
02:04:42,007 --> 02:04:45,249
will be 35,245 feet per second.

1742
02:04:46,745 --> 02:04:49,657
Mark 35 seconds to entry intertace.

1743
02:04:52,451 --> 02:04:53,930
Gentlemen...

1744
02:04:56,521 --> 02:04:59,263
it's been a privilege flying with you.

1745
02:05:41,299 --> 02:05:44,746
- Flight, we have loss of radio contact.
- Roger that.

1746
02:05:44,803 --> 02:05:47,306
Expect to regain signal in three minutes.

1747
02:05:50,976 --> 02:05:52,785
It all depends on the heat shield.

1748
02:06:26,077 --> 02:06:28,716
Back fo the lwo Jima and our live cameras there.

1749
02:06:29,147 --> 02:06:32,526
The Navy recovery and rescue helicopters
already airborne...

1750
02:06:32,584 --> 02:06:35,428
circling, waiting for first radar contact.

1751
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:38,227
Three minutes until time of drogue deployment.

1752
02:06:39,391 --> 02:06:42,736
Standing by for any reports of acquisition.

1753
02:06:47,766 --> 02:06:50,872
One minute and 30 seconds to end of blackout.

1754
02:06:56,174 --> 02:06:58,779
No re-entering ship has ever taken longer...

1755
02:06:58,877 --> 02:07:01,789
than three minutes to emerge from blackout.

1756
02:07:01,846 --> 02:07:05,259
This is the critical moment.
Will the heat shield hold?

1757
02:07:05,684 --> 02:07:09,632
Will the command module survive
the intense heat of re-entry?

1758
02:07:09,955 --> 02:07:12,628
If it doesn't, there'll only be silence.

1759
02:07:12,757 --> 02:07:15,828
- Mommy, you're squishing me.
- Sorry, sweetie.

1760
02:07:16,361 --> 02:07:17,464
It's okay.

1761
02:07:33,812 --> 02:07:35,985
Okay, Flight, that's three minutes.

1762
02:07:36,047 --> 02:07:39,323
- We are standing by for acquisition.
- Copy that.

1763
02:07:40,986 --> 02:07:43,489
Odyssey, Houston. Do you read me?

1764
02:07:46,424 --> 02:07:48,665
Expected time of reacquisition...

1765
02:07:48,727 --> 02:07:52,265
the time when the astronauts
were expected to come out of blackout...

1766
02:07:52,697 --> 02:07:55,370
has come and gone.

1767
02:07:56,434 --> 02:08:00,006
About all any of us can do now
is just listen and hope.

1768
02:08:00,071 --> 02:08:02,915
We're about to learn whether
or not that heat shield...

1769
02:08:02,974 --> 02:08:06,250
which was damaged
by the explosion three days ago...

1770
02:08:06,478 --> 02:08:09,254
has withstood the inferno of re-entry.

1771
02:08:13,351 --> 02:08:16,297
Odyssey, this is Houston. Do you read me?

1772
02:08:22,527 --> 02:08:25,132
Three minutes, 30 seconds. Standing by.

1773
02:08:25,764 --> 02:08:28,107
Odyssey, Houston. Do you read?

1774
02:08:35,974 --> 02:08:38,852
Odyssey, this is Houston. Do you read me?

1775
02:08:43,148 --> 02:08:45,787
That's four minutes. Standing by.

1776
02:09:07,972 --> 02:09:10,179
Odyssey, Houston. Do you read?

1777
02:09:18,616 --> 02:09:21,028
Hello, Houston, this is Odyssey.

1778
02:09:21,152 --> 02:09:22,995
It's good to see you again.

1779
02:09:46,745 --> 02:09:49,088
Odyssey, Houston. Welcome home.

1780
02:09:49,414 --> 02:09:51,359
We're glad to see you.

1781
02:09:51,983 --> 02:09:54,087
- Good job, Ken.
- Thank you.

1782
02:10:38,763 --> 02:10:40,264
They made it!

1783
02:11:23,208 --> 02:11:26,382
Houston, we're at stable one. The ship is secure.

1784
02:11:27,178 --> 02:11:29,521
This is Apollo 13 signing off.

1785
02:11:29,848 --> 02:11:31,190
Good job.

1786
02:12:23,034 --> 02:12:25,673
Our mission was called a successful failure...

1787
02:12:25,770 --> 02:12:29,012
in that we returned safely,
but never made it to the moon.

1788
02:12:29,507 --> 02:12:31,816
In the following months it was determined...

1789
02:12:31,876 --> 02:12:34,947
that a damaged coil
built inside the oxygen tank...

1790
02:12:35,146 --> 02:12:39,753
sparked during our cryo stir and caused
the explosion that crippled the Odyssey.

1791
02:12:40,151 --> 02:12:42,494
It was a minor defect that occurred two years...

1792
02:12:42,587 --> 02:12:44,999
before I was even named the flight's commander.

1793
02:12:45,557 --> 02:12:48,970
Fred Haise was going back
fo the moon on Apollo 18...

1794
02:12:49,027 --> 02:12:51,370
but his mission was cancelled due to budget cuts.

1795
02:12:51,462 --> 02:12:53,464
He never flew in space again.

1796
02:12:53,798 --> 02:12:56,574
Nor did Jack Swigert,
who left the Astronaut Corps...

1797
02:12:56,668 --> 02:12:59,739
and was elected to Congress
from the state of Colorado.

1798
02:12:59,904 --> 02:13:02,816
But he died of cancer
before he was able to take office.

1799
02:13:04,275 --> 02:13:08,154
Ken Mattingly orbited the moon
as command module pilot of Apollo 16...

1800
02:13:08,246 --> 02:13:12,057
and flew the Space Shuttle,
having never gotten the measles.

1801
02:13:12,717 --> 02:13:17,165
Gene Kranz retired as Director
of Flight Operations just not long ago.

1802
02:13:17,455 --> 02:13:20,629
Many members of Mission Control
have gone on to other things...

1803
02:13:20,725 --> 02:13:22,795
but some are still there.

1804
02:13:23,628 --> 02:13:25,107
And as for me...

1805
02:13:25,463 --> 02:13:29,604
the seven extraordinary days of Apollo 13
were my last in space.

1806
02:13:30,602 --> 02:13:34,606
I watched other men walk on the moon
and return safely...

1807
02:13:35,073 --> 02:13:39,316
all from the confines of Mission Control
and our house in Houston.

1808
02:13:40,445 --> 02:13:43,152
I sometimes catch myself
looking up at the moon...

1809
02:13:43,247 --> 02:13:46,694
remembering the changes
of fortune in our long voyage...

1810
02:13:46,951 --> 02:13:51,024
thinking of the thousands of people
who worked to bring the three of us home.

1811
02:13:52,223 --> 02:13:54,828
I look up at the moon and wonder...

1812
02:13:55,493 --> 02:13:57,199
when will we be going back...

1813
02:13:58,062 --> 02:13:59,165
and who will that be?
