1
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,885
60 knots? No way, Barnes.

2
00:01:11,126 --> 00:01:12,829
The Reds don't have anything that fast.

3
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:16,332
Checked it twice. I mean,
it's a real unique signature.

4
00:01:16,419 --> 00:01:19,114
No cavitation. No reactor noise.

5
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,001
It doesn't even sound like screws.

6
00:01:30,134 --> 00:01:31,577
What the hell is it?

7
00:01:33,262 --> 00:01:37,208
I'll tell you what it's not.
It's not one of ours.

8
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:41,539
Sir, contact changing to heading 2-1-4.

9
00:01:41,693 --> 00:01:43,666
Speed...

10
00:01:43,762 --> 00:01:45,812
80 knots.

11
00:01:46,582 --> 00:01:48,603
80 knots.

12
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:53,232
- Still diving. Depth: 900.
- Still diving. Depth: 900 feet.

13
00:01:53,617 --> 00:01:56,639
Port clearance: 150 feet
from the cliff wall, sir.

14
00:01:56,726 --> 00:01:59,103
It's getting tight in here.

15
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,538
We can still give him a haircut.

16
00:02:01,615 --> 00:02:05,022
Helm, come right to... 0-6-9.

17
00:02:05,522 --> 00:02:06,543
Down 5 degrees.

18
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:08,929
Coming right, 0-6-9.
Down 5 degrees. Aye.

19
00:02:09,016 --> 00:02:11,749
Port side clearance: 120 feet.
Narrowing 75.

20
00:02:11,836 --> 00:02:14,261
Sir, we have a proximity warning light.

21
00:02:14,348 --> 00:02:16,725
It's too damn close!
We gotta back off.

22
00:02:16,812 --> 00:02:18,833
Sir, range to contact: 200.

23
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,500
Contact just jinked to bearing 2-6-0
and accelerated to...

24
00:02:24,656 --> 00:02:26,340
...to 130 knots, sir.

25
00:02:27,254 --> 00:02:28,794
Nothin' goes 130.

26
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,240
Sir, range to contact: 100 yards.

27
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:34,309
80 yards, sir!

28
00:02:34,395 --> 00:02:36,214
60!

29
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,390
It's turbulence! We're in its wake!

30
00:02:49,525 --> 00:02:51,556
Helm, all stop! Full right rudder.

31
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,318
Hydraulic failure.
Planes not responding, sir.

32
00:02:54,405 --> 00:02:57,263
Auxiliary power.
Monitors back.

33
00:02:57,456 --> 00:02:59,467
Hydraulics restored, sir.

34
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:04,045
Oh, my God!

35
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:08,029
Fire in sonar!

36
00:03:09,627 --> 00:03:12,659
Collision alarm!
Collision alarm!

37
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:15,979
Fire control to sonar!

38
00:03:20,358 --> 00:03:21,397
Let's get outta here!

39
00:03:22,283 --> 00:03:25,651
- Lighten her up, Charlie!
- Port torpedo room is flooded, sir!

40
00:03:26,421 --> 00:03:29,742
Blow all tanks!
Blow all the tanks! Blow everything!

41
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:35,526
All back full!

42
00:03:35,613 --> 00:03:37,008
Answering, all back full!

43
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:39,799
Give me a damage report!
What's our depth?

44
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,640
Passing 1,400, sir.

45
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:46,729
Main forward tanks are ruptured!

46
00:03:46,873 --> 00:03:48,182
Still descending, sir!

47
00:03:49,414 --> 00:03:50,771
1,450.

48
00:03:54,284 --> 00:03:56,170
Passing 1,500, sir.

49
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:57,672
Still descending.

50
00:03:58,952 --> 00:04:02,946
- We're too deep to pump auxiliaries.
- Passing 1,550, still descending sir.

51
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,679
- We're losin' her!
- Passing 1,600, sir...

52
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:08,480
- ...and still descending!
- Launch the buoy.

53
00:04:10,645 --> 00:04:12,666
- Passing 1,700, sir.
- Launching!

54
00:04:26,564 --> 00:04:28,547
Come on! Give me your hand!

55
00:04:29,827 --> 00:04:31,617
Get the door closed!

56
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,209
Benthic Explorer, Salvor 1 on final. Over.

57
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,808
Copy you, Salvor 1.
This is Benthic Explorer.

58
00:05:12,405 --> 00:05:13,434
You're cleared to land.

59
00:05:14,743 --> 00:05:16,813
Hey! They're coming.

60
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,976
This... could get pretty ugly.

61
00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:28,535
Yeah.

62
00:05:28,554 --> 00:05:30,498
Does not look good at all.

63
00:06:04,078 --> 00:06:06,830
Oh, no. Look who's with them.

64
00:06:07,186 --> 00:06:09,313
The queen bitch of the universe.

65
00:06:09,718 --> 00:06:11,479
Sonny, how you doin'?

66
00:06:11,575 --> 00:06:13,895
I've got 2 more welds on
this bypass valve.

67
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:16,840
No light from the surface.

68
00:06:16,936 --> 00:06:19,130
- How deep are they?
- McBride?

69
00:06:19,217 --> 00:06:21,209
1,700 feet.

70
00:06:21,296 --> 00:06:25,011
- I need them to go below 2,000.
- No problem. They can do that.

71
00:06:25,742 --> 00:06:31,305
So that's it? You just cheerfully turn
the whole thing over to the goon squad?

72
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:34,510
Look, I was told to cooperate.
I'm cooperating.

73
00:06:35,036 --> 00:06:37,115
Kirkhill, you're pathetic.

74
00:06:37,635 --> 00:06:39,194
Get Brigman on the line.

75
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,282
Deepcore, this is Benthic.

76
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,083
Man, if Bud goes along with this...

77
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:46,681
...they're gonna have to shoot her
with a tranquilizer gun.

78
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,261
- Roger.
- Hippy, get me Bud.

79
00:06:56,546 --> 00:07:00,252
Catfish, get them old bones up here
and give me a hand.

80
00:07:00,675 --> 00:07:02,658
Hang on. I'll be up there in a second.

81
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,117
Hey, you guys are milkin' that job.

82
00:07:10,165 --> 00:07:14,111
Yeah, it's just because we love freezing
our butts off out here for you so much.

83
00:07:15,295 --> 00:07:17,287
- Bring me another hammer!

84
00:07:21,762 --> 00:07:23,572
- Hey, Bud!
- Yeah!?

85
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:25,660
Hippy's on the bitch box!

86
00:07:26,526 --> 00:07:29,125
It's a call from topside.
That new company man.

87
00:07:29,173 --> 00:07:30,232
- Kirkhill?
- Yeah.

88
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:32,541
That guy don't know his
butt from a rat hole.

89
00:07:33,436 --> 00:07:35,679
Perry, do me a favor, will you
square away this mud hose...

90
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,642
and get rid of some
of these empty sacks.

91
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:40,963
- This place is starting to look like my apartment.
- You got it, boss!

92
00:07:43,658 --> 00:07:47,459
- Bud, pick up the topside line. Urgent.
- I'm coming, I'm coming!

93
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:49,865
Jeez, keep your pantyhose on!

94
00:07:56,747 --> 00:07:58,383
Brigman here.

95
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:01,260
Yeah, Kirkhill. What's goin' on?

96
00:08:01,357 --> 00:08:03,349
Yeah, I'm calm.

97
00:08:03,436 --> 00:08:07,324
I'm a calm person. Is there some reason
why I shouldn't be calm?

98
00:08:12,434 --> 00:08:13,300
What!?

99
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:18,854
All right, I'm on last feed now.

100
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:26,938
Hey can you get that goddamn hippy
shit music off the comm line, please?

101
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:35,119
I'm almost done with the shut-off valve.

102
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,276
Sonny, I'm right behind you
with the next fitting.

103
00:08:38,487 --> 00:08:39,864
Hang on a second.

104
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,676
- OK, give it to me.
- Here you go.

105
00:08:44,772 --> 00:08:45,686
Thanks, sweetie.

106
00:08:50,932 --> 00:08:53,578
All divers, drop what you're doin'.
Everybody out of the pool.

107
00:08:55,503 --> 00:08:59,449
I mean everybody right now.
Sonny, One Night, let's go.

108
00:08:59,545 --> 00:09:01,836
Damn it. We just got out here.

109
00:09:02,721 --> 00:09:04,560
There was a time when I woulda asked why.

110
00:09:06,802 --> 00:09:08,881
- Get a move on!
- Shit, woman!

111
00:09:16,436 --> 00:09:20,142
Deepcore, Deepcore.
This is Flatbed preparing to surface.

112
00:09:20,228 --> 00:09:22,692
Roger, Flatbed. Come on up.

113
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,686
All rig personnel assemble at the moon pool.

114
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:29,573
Everybody get to sub bay. ASAP.

115
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,232
Come on. Let's get his hat off.

116
00:09:36,455 --> 00:09:38,861
- Take it off.
- What the hell's goin' on?

117
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:41,209
- How come we got recalled?
- The hell if I know.

118
00:09:41,296 --> 00:09:42,326
I got it.

119
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:47,378
- What's the drift, partner? Why are we up?
- Just follow standard procedure.

120
00:09:47,465 --> 00:09:50,189
Flog your dog till somebody
tells you what's happenin'.

121
00:09:51,228 --> 00:09:53,249
- What's the story, boss?
- Folks, listen up!

122
00:09:54,037 --> 00:09:56,790
We just been told to shut down the hole
and prepare to move the rig.

123
00:09:56,876 --> 00:09:58,561
- Oh, shit!
- What?

124
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:04,454
We've received an invitation to, um,
cooperate in a matter of national security.

125
00:10:05,994 --> 00:10:07,245
Now you know as much as I do.

126
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:10,286
Get your gear off and get to control.
We've got a briefing in 10 minutes.

127
00:10:10,373 --> 00:10:12,173
Come on, come on! Let's move it!

128
00:10:13,116 --> 00:10:17,014
At 09:22 local time today,
an American nuclear submarine...

129
00:10:17,062 --> 00:10:20,479
...the USS Montana,
with 156 men aboard, went down...

130
00:10:20,527 --> 00:10:23,029
- ...about 22 miles from here.
- Damn!

131
00:10:23,116 --> 00:10:26,783
There's been no contact with the sub since
then. The cause of the incident is not known.

132
00:10:26,804 --> 00:10:29,259
Your company has authorized
the navy's use of this facility...

133
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:33,744
...for a rescue operation
code-named Operation Salvor.

134
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,680
- You want us to search for the sub?
- No. We know where it is.

135
00:10:37,776 --> 00:10:40,355
But she's in 2,000 feet of water
and we can't reach her.

136
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:44,513
We need divers to enter the sub
and search for survivors, if any.

137
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:46,823
Don't you have your own stuff for this kind of thing?

138
00:10:46,871 --> 00:10:50,192
By the time we get our submersibles here,
the storm will be on us.

139
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:54,571
You can get your rig in and be on site
in 15 hours. That makes you our best option.

140
00:10:55,341 --> 00:10:57,776
Why should we risk our butts
for something like this?

141
00:10:57,862 --> 00:11:01,163
I have been authorized
to offer you all special bonuses...

142
00:11:01,211 --> 00:11:03,569
...equivalent to 3 times normal dive pay.

143
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,458
Yes, sir, buddy!

144
00:11:06,254 --> 00:11:07,679
For triple time, I'd eat Beany!

145
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:10,203
Set me on fire
and put me out with horse piss.

146
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,801
Look I don't know what kind of deal
you made with the company...

147
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,770
...but my people are not
qualified for this.

148
00:11:15,771 --> 00:11:16,747
- We're oil workers
- This is a paycheck!

149
00:11:16,853 --> 00:11:19,153
Shut up! Hold it down.

150
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,521
This is Lieutenant Coffey.

151
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:25,371
He will transfer down to you with
a SEAL team and supervise the operation.

152
00:11:25,457 --> 00:11:28,537
You can send down whoever you like,
but I'm the tool pusher on this rig.

153
00:11:28,624 --> 00:11:32,021
When it comes to the safety of these people,
there's me and then God.

154
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,418
Understand? If things get dicey,

155
00:11:34,514 --> 00:11:36,506
I'm pulling the plug.

156
00:11:38,258 --> 00:11:40,837
I think we're all
on the same wavelength, Brigman.

157
00:11:42,011 --> 00:11:44,080
Now, let's get the wellhead uncoupled,
shall we?

158
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,267
All right let's get ready to meet.

159
00:12:15,823 --> 00:12:17,969
Let's take it about 5 degrees left, all right?

160
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,607
Roger. 5 degrees left, Bud.

161
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:31,790
Plot these numbers to our position.
I need to know when the leading edge will hit.

162
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:35,515
Well, it's official sports fans.
They're calling it Hurricane Frederick.

163
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:38,258
And it's gonna be making our lives...

164
00:12:38,306 --> 00:12:40,837
- ...real interesting in a few hours.
- Fred, huh?

165
00:12:41,471 --> 00:12:44,339
I don't know, man. I think hurricanes
should be named after women, don't you?

166
00:12:52,587 --> 00:12:55,715
- I can't believe you're letting them do this.
- Hi, Lins!

167
00:12:56,437 --> 00:12:57,967
I thought you were in Houston.

168
00:12:58,698 --> 00:13:00,864
I was. Now I'm here.

169
00:13:01,153 --> 00:13:04,858
- Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
- Wasn't up to me.

170
00:13:04,954 --> 00:13:08,380
We were that close to proving
a submersible drilling platform could work.

171
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:11,451
- I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
- Your rig?

172
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,963
- My rig. I designed the damn thing.
- Benthic Petroleum paid for it.

173
00:13:15,012 --> 00:13:18,091
So as long as they're holding the pink slip,
I go where they tell me.

174
00:13:18,717 --> 00:13:23,240
I had a lot riding on this. They bought you,
didn't they? More like rented you cheap!

175
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:25,117
I'm switchin' off now.

176
00:13:26,031 --> 00:13:26,898
Bye-bye.

177
00:13:26,946 --> 00:13:30,796
Oh, OK. Virgil, you wiener!
You never could stand up to a fight!

178
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:32,287
Bye-bye.

179
00:13:32,865 --> 00:13:33,827
Virgil?

180
00:13:36,714 --> 00:13:38,014
God, I hate that bitch!

181
00:13:39,746 --> 00:13:41,815
Probably shouldn't have
married her, then, huh?

182
00:13:47,101 --> 00:13:48,208
Get it stable!

183
00:13:52,962 --> 00:13:55,041
Roger Cab 3. You're clear to launch.

184
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,247
Hang on, gentlemen.

185
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:06,591
Touchdown! Crowd goes wild!

186
00:14:09,622 --> 00:14:11,990
Explorer, this is Cab 3.
We are styling.

187
00:14:12,943 --> 00:14:15,156
- How you boys doin' back there?
- Great.

188
00:14:18,044 --> 00:14:21,556
Explorer, this is Cab 3.
Starting our descent along the umbilical.

189
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:25,502
- Roger that, Cab 3. Good luck.
- Luck is not a factor.

190
00:14:34,944 --> 00:14:36,477
Hey, One Night, how you doing?

191
00:14:36,858 --> 00:14:38,398
I got a white line fever, baby.

192
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,515
Yeah, I heard that.

193
00:15:57,025 --> 00:15:58,180
Deepcore, Deepcore.

194
00:15:58,328 --> 00:16:03,092
- This is Cab 3 on final approach.
- Roger, Cab 3. Is that you, Lindsey?

195
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:05,547
None other.

196
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:09,637
Oh, no!

197
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,177
Howdy, boys!

198
00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:33,573
Hey, Lindsey!

199
00:16:33,621 --> 00:16:34,920
I'll be damned!

200
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:38,193
Y'all shouldn't be down here, sweet thing.
You might ruin your stockings.

201
00:16:44,063 --> 00:16:46,566
The bad news is we got 8 hours
in this can blowin' down.

202
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:50,752
And the worst news is
it's gonna take us 3 weeks...

203
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,843
- ...to decompress later.
- We've all been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.

204
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:56,816
Just don't call me that, OK? I hate that.

205
00:16:59,077 --> 00:17:01,868
All right. What would you
like us to call you?

206
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:03,620
Sir?

207
00:17:07,046 --> 00:17:08,269
There we go!

208
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,300
Y'all start equalizin'... now!

209
00:17:15,824 --> 00:17:19,192
Let's watch each other closely
for signs of HPNS.

210
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,272
High Pressure Nervous Syndrome.
Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.

211
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,563
- Nausea, increased excitability...
- Disorientation.

212
00:17:19,482 --> 00:17:22,196
And a partridge in a pear tree.

213
00:17:29,753 --> 00:17:32,929
About 1 person in 20 can't handle it.
They just go buggo.

214
00:17:33,602 --> 00:17:35,431
Look, they've all made
runs to this depth.

215
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:37,500
- They checked out.
- I understand that.

216
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,955
What I'm saying is it's
impossible to predict...

217
00:17:40,003 --> 00:17:43,390
- ...just who's susceptible.
- They checked out.

218
00:17:45,796 --> 00:17:47,654
- These guys the SEALs?
- Yeah.

219
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,946
Those guys ain't so tough.
I've fought guys plenty tougher than them.

220
00:17:51,985 --> 00:17:55,459
Now we get to hear
how you could have been a contender?

221
00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:56,605
Hey! Hey!

222
00:17:57,067 --> 00:17:58,722
- You see this?
- Yeah.

223
00:17:58,866 --> 00:18:00,936
They used to call this the hammer.

224
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,918
Y'all done to a turn
and ready to serve.

225
00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:14,698
Everybody OK?

226
00:18:19,222 --> 00:18:21,676
- They're really very sweet.
- Yeah.

227
00:18:21,724 --> 00:18:25,324
Hey! I don't remember putting a wall here.
How you doin', Jammer?

228
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:27,643
- Pretty good. How are you, little lady?
- I'm OK.

229
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:37,123
- I want a full check on their gear.
- Yes sir.

230
00:18:37,412 --> 00:18:40,251
- These guys are about as much fun as a tax audit.
- Got that right.

231
00:18:56,364 --> 00:18:58,578
Hippy, you're gonna give that rat a disease.

232
00:18:58,751 --> 00:18:59,925
Hi, Lins!

233
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,604
Well, well. Mrs. Brigman.

234
00:19:05,981 --> 00:19:07,203
Not for long.

235
00:19:10,601 --> 00:19:12,574
You never did like being
called that, did you?

236
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,798
Not even when it meant something.

237
00:19:18,493 --> 00:19:21,765
- Is that One Night in Flatbed?
- Yeah. Who else? Here. Say hi.

238
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:26,818
- Hey, One Night. It's Lindsey.
- Oh, hi, Lindsey.

239
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,994
OK Bud obstacle avoidance
is showin' a rise

240
00:19:35,995 --> 00:19:38,319
out about 100 meters.
What do you wanna do?

241
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:40,737
Copy Bud.

242
00:19:40,738 --> 00:19:43,227
You know I can't believe you
were dumb enough to come down here.

243
00:19:43,275 --> 00:19:44,719
Now you're stuck
here for the storm.

244
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,328
- That was dumb, hot rod. Real dumb.
- I didn't come down here to fight with you.

245
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:49,719
Copy you.

246
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:56,269
Yeah, well...
So what did you come down?

247
00:19:56,269 --> 00:19:59,986
You need me. Nobody knows
the systems on this rig better than I do.

248
00:20:00,162 --> 00:20:01,425
Once you're disconnected
from The Explorer

249
00:20:01,425 --> 00:20:04,445
You guys are on your own
for however long this storm lasts.

250
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,346
I mean what if something was to happen
after the surface support clears off?

251
00:20:06,347 --> 00:20:08,102
What would you have done?

252
00:20:08,151 --> 00:20:12,145
Wow, you're right. Us poor dumb old boys
might've had to think for ourselves.

253
00:20:12,193 --> 00:20:13,829
It could've been a disaster.

254
00:20:15,994 --> 00:20:18,785
- You wanna know what I think?
- Jesus! Look where this thing is set.

255
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:22,587
- You wanna know what I think?
- Not particularly.

256
00:20:22,683 --> 00:20:25,619
- I think you were worried about me.
- Then that must be it.

257
00:20:25,867 --> 00:20:29,284
No, seriously. I think you were.
Come on. It's OK.

258
00:20:29,476 --> 00:20:31,160
It's OK. You can admit it.

259
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,748
I was worried... about the rig.

260
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:35,663
I've got over 4 years
invested in this project.

261
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:37,819
Yeah, you only had 3 years
invested in me.

262
00:20:40,177 --> 00:20:41,958
Well, you have to have priorities.

263
00:20:55,913 --> 00:21:00,436
It's kinda messy, but, I guarantee you
it's the only bunk that won't be occupied.

264
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,974
You can get a couple of hours rest
before we get there.

265
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:05,889
What are you still wearing that for?

266
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:08,776
I don't know.

267
00:21:11,134 --> 00:21:12,530
Divorce ain't final.

268
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:15,658
Forgot to take it off.

269
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,652
I haven't worn mine in months.

270
00:21:20,662 --> 00:21:21,481
Yeah.

271
00:21:22,395 --> 00:21:25,879
Well, 'what's his name' wouldn't like it.
The suit.

272
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:29,709
Do you always have to call him that?

273
00:21:29,902 --> 00:21:33,136
The suit. Makes you sound like such a hick.

274
00:21:33,222 --> 00:21:34,377
His name is Michael.

275
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:37,409
How is Michael anyway? Mr. Brooks Brothers.

276
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:39,286
Mr. BMW.

277
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:41,018
You still seeing him?

278
00:21:42,173 --> 00:21:42,943
No.

279
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,851
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.

280
00:21:49,295 --> 00:21:51,701
Terribly sorry. What happened?

281
00:21:54,444 --> 00:21:57,139
Why are you doing this?
This is... this is none of your business!

282
00:21:57,187 --> 00:21:58,919
It's not a part of your life any more.

283
00:22:00,315 --> 00:22:01,662
I'll tell you what happened.

284
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:04,779
You woke up one morning
in those satin sheets...

285
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,014
...rolled over,
and there was this good-looking guy.

286
00:22:09,206 --> 00:22:11,323
Well-groomed, expensive watch on.

287
00:22:11,343 --> 00:22:13,970
And you realized,
"This guy never makes me laugh."

288
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,916
That's it, Bud. That's it!
Aren't you clever? Jesus! You're clever!

289
00:22:17,964 --> 00:22:20,611
You know, you should start your own talk show or something!
Ask Dr. Bud.

290
00:22:20,851 --> 00:22:23,258
'Advice to the Lovelorn from 300 Fathoms.'

291
00:22:23,498 --> 00:22:25,471
Thank you. Thank you.

292
00:22:59,156 --> 00:23:01,177
Oh, shit!

293
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:06,326
- Cuttin' you loose, Bud.
- OK, One Night. Stay clear.

294
00:23:06,423 --> 00:23:07,674
We're settin' her down.

295
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:15,518
Touchdown!

296
00:23:16,388 --> 00:23:19,756
This is us, sitting right on the edge
of the Cayman Trough.

297
00:23:20,382 --> 00:23:25,098
This is the Montana.
300 meters away, 70 meters below us.

298
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:29,525
We think she slid down the wall
and now sits here on this outcropping.

299
00:23:30,343 --> 00:23:34,337
So we're gonna have to drop
straight down... here and...

300
00:23:34,385 --> 00:23:36,474
This tell us how much radiation we're gettin'?

301
00:23:36,503 --> 00:23:39,919
Whoa whoa whoa! I'm not going near
no radiation! No way!

302
00:23:39,967 --> 00:23:42,248
- Ah Hippy, you pussy.
- Yeah what good is the money...

303
00:23:42,277 --> 00:23:44,346
...6 months later your dick drops off.

304
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,533
We'll take readings as we go.
If the reactor's breached...

305
00:23:48,581 --> 00:23:52,104
...the warheads have released
any radioactive debris, we'll just back off.

306
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,182
- It's that simple.
- Oh, OK.

307
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,167
OK. Hippy's not going,
so, McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.

308
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:01,622
Oh goddamn it! You know
McWhirter can't run an ROV worth shit!

309
00:24:01,863 --> 00:24:03,162
Then you'd better go.

310
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:04,894
I'll go.

311
00:24:06,242 --> 00:24:09,033
What is your problem huh? On this dive...

312
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:11,920
...you'll do absolutely nothing
without direct orders from me.

313
00:24:11,968 --> 00:24:14,904
And you'll follow those orders
without discussion. Is that clear?

314
00:24:17,598 --> 00:24:20,726
All right, I want everyone to finish prep and
ready to get wet in 15 minutes.

315
00:24:22,603 --> 00:24:26,309
- One of you guys gimme a hand loading Little Geek, OK?
- Let's get suited up.

316
00:24:26,588 --> 00:24:28,657
Hey, guys, guys! Hold it a second.

317
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,736
- Before you're jumping...
- Hold it!

318
00:24:30,794 --> 00:24:32,564
- I've to charge the main batteries
- Whoa!

319
00:24:33,935 --> 00:24:36,336
- Ok. Here we go.
- This goes to the right...

320
00:24:36,414 --> 00:24:37,617
Look uh...

321
00:24:38,483 --> 00:24:43,247
...it's 3 am. These guys are running on
bad coffee and about 4 hours of sleep.

322
00:24:43,267 --> 00:24:44,970
Maybe you could think about
cuttin' them some slack.

323
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:49,888
- I can't afford slack.
- Hey you come on my rig, you don't talk to me...

324
00:24:49,917 --> 00:24:52,102
...you start ordering my people around.
It's not gonna work.

325
00:24:53,016 --> 00:24:55,019
You gotta know how to
handle these people.

326
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,347
We got a certain way of
doing things around here.

327
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,638
Right now, I'm not interested
in your way of doing things.

328
00:24:59,639 --> 00:25:01,380
Just get your
team ready to dive.

329
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:05,004
- Did you check the rig?
- Finler did it last night.

330
00:25:07,534 --> 00:25:09,218
These guys have got no sense of humor.

331
00:25:13,886 --> 00:25:15,637
Bud, do you know your hand is blue?

332
00:25:16,869 --> 00:25:19,131
Finler, why don't you just shut up
and put your gear on?

333
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:20,142
Keep it coming.

334
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,521
- Hippy, throw me 1 of them cyalumes, please.
- Yeah sure.

335
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,552
- Good.
- Excuse me.

336
00:25:28,515 --> 00:25:31,835
- What is all this stuff?
- Fluid Breathing System. We just got them.

337
00:25:32,942 --> 00:25:35,108
- You use it when you go really deep.
- How deep?

338
00:25:36,214 --> 00:25:37,947
- Deep.
- How deep?

339
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:39,968
It's classified.

340
00:25:40,738 --> 00:25:42,470
Anyway you breathe liquid
so you can't get compressed.

341
00:25:42,518 --> 00:25:45,781
- The pressure doesn't get you.
- You mean you got liquid in your lungs?

342
00:25:46,897 --> 00:25:48,630
Oxygenated, fluorocarbon...

343
00:25:48,678 --> 00:25:49,958
- ...emulsion.
- Bullshit!

344
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:53,442
Check this out.

345
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,099
- Can I borrow your rat?
- What are you doin'?

346
00:25:57,742 --> 00:26:00,131
- Hey, no no no!
- You're gonna... you're gonna kill her!

347
00:26:00,275 --> 00:26:03,836
- It's OK. I've done this myself.
- Man! You're just drowning her?

348
00:26:01,984 --> 00:26:05,437
She's gonna be fine.

349
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:07,206
I've breathed this myself.

350
00:26:07,297 --> 00:26:09,270
- It's gonna be fine.
- No, man. She's gonna drown!

351
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:12,206
- Look, look! She's freaking out!
- Just goin' through a normal adjustment period.

352
00:26:12,254 --> 00:26:14,804
Normal!? Does this look normal to you?
She's gonna drown!

353
00:26:15,035 --> 00:26:16,777
He's taking the fluid into his lungs.

354
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:20,434
He's taking the fluid into his lungs.

355
00:26:23,216 --> 00:26:26,690
There he goes.
Still has a bit of anxiety here.

356
00:26:27,701 --> 00:26:31,117
Now he's starting to relax.
He's breathing fine. See his chest moving?

357
00:26:31,743 --> 00:26:35,150
- He's getting plenty of oxygen.
- Damn rat's breathing that shit.

358
00:26:36,266 --> 00:26:40,357
That is, no bullshit, hands down,
the goddamndest thing I ever saw.

359
00:26:40,597 --> 00:26:44,255
See the fluid's harder to push in and out than air.
It's a little more work to breathe.

360
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:47,296
But he's doing fine. He's diggin' it.

361
00:26:48,104 --> 00:26:50,799
She's doin' it. She ain't diggin' it.
All right, let her out now!

362
00:26:51,232 --> 00:26:53,013
- Now!
- OK. All right.

363
00:26:54,023 --> 00:26:56,333
OK. Now we let the fluid
drain from his lungs.

364
00:26:58,114 --> 00:26:59,557
All right. Give her here.
Give her here.

365
00:27:00,135 --> 00:27:01,097
Here's your rat.

366
00:27:02,782 --> 00:27:04,514
- See? He's fine!
- It's a she.

367
00:27:07,074 --> 00:27:08,181
Going over the wall.

368
00:27:08,797 --> 00:27:10,577
Coming to bearing 0-6-5.

369
00:27:12,502 --> 00:27:13,705
Flatbed, you online?

370
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:16,063
10-4, Lindsey.
We read you loud and clear.

371
00:27:18,806 --> 00:27:20,923
Starting our descent.
Divers, how you doin'?

372
00:27:21,693 --> 00:27:23,089
Everybody's OK so far.

373
00:27:24,051 --> 00:27:26,361
Hang on, boys.
It's all downhill from here.

374
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:31,606
- Hey, how deep's the drop-off here?
- This here's the bottomless pit, baby.

375
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,494
2 and a half miles straight down.

376
00:27:38,921 --> 00:27:40,461
Cab 3, it's Bud.
You on line?

377
00:27:41,308 --> 00:27:42,289
Cab 3 check.

378
00:27:42,338 --> 00:27:43,541
I'm right behind you.

379
00:27:48,305 --> 00:27:49,845
Cab 1, do you see it yet?

380
00:27:51,288 --> 00:27:54,560
Magnetometer's twitching,
but I don't see anything yet.

381
00:27:54,657 --> 00:27:56,293
Hang on. I'm gonna test my strobes.

382
00:28:01,808 --> 00:28:03,396
Cab 1, do you have a visual?

383
00:28:06,861 --> 00:28:08,978
- Cab 1, do you copy?
- Uh yeah.

384
00:28:09,363 --> 00:28:11,288
Roger that. Found it.

385
00:28:26,928 --> 00:28:28,804
Cab 1, radiation readings?

386
00:28:29,218 --> 00:28:30,681
Neutron counter's not showing much.

387
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,665
All right.
Just continue forward along the hull.

388
00:28:34,675 --> 00:28:39,535
Copy that. Continuing forward.
You want me to get shots of everything, yes?

389
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,653
Roger that. Document as much as you can.

390
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:44,646
But, please, keep moving.
Remember, we're on a tight time line.

391
00:28:45,127 --> 00:28:45,888
Copy that.

392
00:28:50,219 --> 00:28:53,587
Coming up to the mid-ship's hatch.
Do you see it, Cab 3?

393
00:28:53,635 --> 00:28:54,646
Yeah, roger. I got it.

394
00:28:59,516 --> 00:29:02,105
- How do you want me?
- Just hold above it.

395
00:29:02,297 --> 00:29:04,944
- Roger. Holding.
- OK. It's all yours, Lieutenant.

396
00:29:05,136 --> 00:29:06,965
- All right, 'A Team.'
- Let's do it.

397
00:29:22,797 --> 00:29:24,144
OK. Perry, Hippy.

398
00:29:24,241 --> 00:29:27,320
- Let's get that R.O.V. launched.
- OK. We're on it, boss.

399
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,197
Go!

400
00:29:33,528 --> 00:29:35,549
Little Geek is on the case.

401
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:48,879
Monk here, sir.
We got the mid-ship’s outer hatch open.

402
00:29:51,285 --> 00:29:52,344
Entering escape trunk.

403
00:29:55,905 --> 00:29:57,156
Inner hatch looks intact.

404
00:30:03,556 --> 00:30:05,625
It's flooded. All right,
I'm gonna open her up.

405
00:30:16,164 --> 00:30:17,271
OK. Get in there.

406
00:30:19,003 --> 00:30:22,025
- Roger. Somebody get on that tether.
- Got it.

407
00:30:22,949 --> 00:30:26,077
Sorry about this, little buddy, but better
you than me. You know what I mean?

408
00:30:35,361 --> 00:30:37,074
Coffey, these are the missile hatches, right?

409
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,924
That's right. It looks like
a couple of the hatches have sprung.

410
00:30:41,935 --> 00:30:44,822
Radiation's nominal.
Warheads must still be intact.

411
00:30:45,351 --> 00:30:46,121
How many are there?

412
00:30:46,795 --> 00:30:49,778
24 Trident missiles. 8 MIRVs per missile.

413
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,762
That's 192 warheads, Coffey.

414
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:55,072
How powerful are they?

415
00:30:55,842 --> 00:30:59,884
Your MIRV is a tactical nuke.
50 kilotons nominal yield.

416
00:31:00,221 --> 00:31:02,242
Say... 5 times Hiroshima.

417
00:31:05,514 --> 00:31:06,573
Jesus Christ!

418
00:31:07,968 --> 00:31:09,412
It's World War III in a can.

419
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,914
Let's knock off the chatter people.

420
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:15,764
OK. I'm headin' into the reactor compartment.

421
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,603
- Getting a reading?
- Uh it's twitching.

422
00:31:18,988 --> 00:31:21,106
But it's below the line you said was safe.

423
00:31:22,646 --> 00:31:23,926
All right. Let's get in there.

424
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,456
Flatbed, drop down starboard
of the sail and stay along the cliff edge.

425
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,189
OK. Copy that.

426
00:31:45,022 --> 00:31:46,216
Keep heading for the bow.

427
00:31:55,753 --> 00:31:57,245
OK, Flatbed. This looks good.

428
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,132
Just set it down here.

429
00:32:04,263 --> 00:32:06,015
- We're solid.
- Let's go.

430
00:32:07,632 --> 00:32:08,642
All right. Let's go.

431
00:32:18,459 --> 00:32:21,683
OK. Let's just take it slow and easy goin' in.

432
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,993
Don't take any chances.

433
00:32:50,412 --> 00:32:51,374
Where are we, Coffey?

434
00:32:52,385 --> 00:32:55,128
This is the forward berthing compartment.
This way.

435
00:33:11,008 --> 00:33:14,858
- You guys OK? Cat? Jammer?
- Right behind you, Bud.

436
00:33:15,676 --> 00:33:16,638
Check your gauges.

437
00:33:18,226 --> 00:33:18,987
How's your O2?

438
00:33:19,911 --> 00:33:22,557
- I'm OK.
- Yeah, gauges are good.

439
00:33:23,404 --> 00:33:24,001
OK.

440
00:33:24,578 --> 00:33:25,685
16 minutes to go.

441
00:33:36,464 --> 00:33:38,004
Jammer here. CO2 is up.

442
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:41,517
- Breathe slower, buddy.
- I'm OK.

443
00:33:48,928 --> 00:33:50,324
Come on. Let's keep up.

444
00:33:52,008 --> 00:33:53,788
All right, up this way to the control center.

445
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,258
It's jammed! Gimme a hand!

446
00:34:22,498 --> 00:34:23,701
Get up here with that pry bar.

447
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,840
It's moving. Pull!

448
00:34:37,368 --> 00:34:39,148
- Jesus!
- Oh God.

449
00:34:39,437 --> 00:34:41,266
All right! We knew we were gonna see this.

450
00:34:41,535 --> 00:34:42,421
Just move on.

451
00:34:46,367 --> 00:34:48,301
- Jesus!
- Come on, Jammer. Let's go.

452
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:24,912
OK. Let's stay cool.

453
00:35:26,308 --> 00:35:27,607
Everybody stay cool.

454
00:35:28,954 --> 00:35:32,130
We can't help these guys,
but we might find somebody further in.

455
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:40,070
Stay here.

456
00:35:55,662 --> 00:35:57,587
Hey, Jammer. You OK?

457
00:35:59,993 --> 00:36:02,062
- How you guys doin'?
- I'm dealin'.

458
00:36:01,106 --> 00:36:04,427
Triple time sounded like
a lot of money, Bud. It ain't.

459
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:06,304
We're here. Let's get it done, OK?

460
00:36:06,881 --> 00:36:09,528
Brigman, take your men and continue aft.

461
00:36:10,365 --> 00:36:12,126
Split up into 2 teams.

462
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:15,976
Come on. Let's get moving.
We head back in 14 minutes.

463
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,420
Let's go.

464
00:36:25,668 --> 00:36:26,611
You OK, Jammer?

465
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:29,113
Yeah, I'm fine.

466
00:36:34,551 --> 00:36:37,727
- What's this?
- Should be the missile launch control center.

467
00:36:37,968 --> 00:36:40,662
- Don't touch anything.
- No, no, n-n-n-n-no.

468
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:42,539
This way.

469
00:36:43,598 --> 00:36:44,512
I'm right behind you.

470
00:37:06,497 --> 00:37:08,903
- Still with me, Jammer?
- Where are we?

471
00:37:09,047 --> 00:37:12,945
Missile compartment.
Those are the launch tubes.

472
00:37:19,952 --> 00:37:22,570
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

473
00:37:23,979 --> 00:37:24,749
Hey, Jammer.

474
00:37:27,252 --> 00:37:27,877
Hey! Hey!

475
00:37:27,925 --> 00:37:29,562
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! You OK?

476
00:37:31,053 --> 00:37:32,449
Deep and slow, big guy.

477
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,673
- Deep and slow. Just breathe easy.
- Everybody's dead!

478
00:37:36,077 --> 00:37:39,330
- They're all dead!
- OK. I'm taking you back out. Let's go.

479
00:37:39,378 --> 00:37:41,544
No. I'm OK. I'm OK.

480
00:37:46,115 --> 00:37:47,655
I just can't go any further in.

481
00:37:48,425 --> 00:37:50,350
OK, Jammer. No problem.
You stay right here.

482
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,660
I've gotta check out this compartment,
all right?

483
00:37:53,574 --> 00:37:57,376
We'll stay in voice contact.
You hold onto the end of this rope here.

484
00:37:57,443 --> 00:38:00,552
You have any problem whatsoever,
you tug twice.

485
00:38:00,841 --> 00:38:02,958
- I got it.
- Pull it hard. 5 more minutes.

486
00:38:03,728 --> 00:38:05,460
Just relax, all right? You'll be OK.

487
00:38:05,508 --> 00:38:07,000
- It's OK.
- Be right back.

488
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,908
You still readin' me OK, big guy?

489
00:38:53,871 --> 00:38:54,881
Read you fine, Bud.

490
00:39:01,493 --> 00:39:04,380
OK. Just a few more minutes.

491
00:39:05,102 --> 00:39:07,989
There's a couple of compartments up ahead
that might have air.

492
00:39:08,037 --> 00:39:10,636
- OK. No problem.
- We gotta be sure, right?

493
00:39:11,262 --> 00:39:13,331
Hang on, Jammer.
Just hold onto that...

494
00:39:20,453 --> 00:39:21,511
Shit!

495
00:39:23,051 --> 00:39:24,976
Bud? Bud can you hear me?

496
00:39:25,746 --> 00:39:28,152
Bud? Bud?

497
00:39:31,473 --> 00:39:32,291
Goddamn it!

498
00:39:44,754 --> 00:39:45,813
Oh, Jesus!

499
00:40:14,504 --> 00:40:15,370
Bud, is that you?

500
00:40:37,843 --> 00:40:38,902
Hang on, Jammer.

501
00:40:42,078 --> 00:40:44,339
Lew! Cat! Hurry up, on the double!

502
00:40:45,687 --> 00:40:46,457
I'm on my way!

503
00:40:53,771 --> 00:40:54,589
Jammer!

504
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,883
- What's the problem?
- He's convulsing!

505
00:41:02,674 --> 00:41:04,310
It's his mixture! Too much oxygen!

506
00:41:05,898 --> 00:41:08,352
Gotta get the O2 cut down! Turn him over!

507
00:41:10,373 --> 00:41:12,154
Crank it down, man! You're losing him!

508
00:41:16,244 --> 00:41:18,362
All right. We've gotta get him outta here!
Let's go. Let's move it.

509
00:41:19,998 --> 00:41:21,008
Easy, big fella.

510
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,542
One Night, do you see the divers?
Are they out yet?

511
00:41:26,571 --> 00:41:29,333
Negative, Lindsey.
Haven't seen hide nor hair.

512
00:41:30,017 --> 00:41:31,499
Let's give 'em 2 minutes more max...

513
00:41:31,547 --> 00:41:33,809
...and then I'll sound the diver recall.

514
00:41:54,485 --> 00:41:56,022
Lindsey, do you copy?

515
00:41:56,329 --> 00:41:59,092
Meet me at Flatbed!
This is a diver emergency!

516
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,633
- Lins, do you copy!
- Yeah, copy you, Bud. I'm on my way.

517
00:42:08,989 --> 00:42:10,048
Look, I'm just a medic.

518
00:42:11,684 --> 00:42:14,860
Which is mostly about patching holes.
This type of thing, it's...

519
00:42:15,871 --> 00:42:17,025
...there's not much I can do.

520
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,731
The coma could last hours or days.

521
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:29,522
So, you didn't get anything
on these cameras

522
00:42:30,431 --> 00:42:32,548
No, I didn't get a picture of it.

523
00:42:32,789 --> 00:42:34,377
- What about the video?
- No.

524
00:42:35,051 --> 00:42:36,542
We lost power right then.

525
00:42:37,409 --> 00:42:39,815
Look, I just don't wanna
talk about this, OK?

526
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:41,836
Fine. Be that way.

527
00:42:42,606 --> 00:42:44,531
Look, I don't know what
I saw, Bud, OK?

528
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:47,322
Coffey wants to call it
a Russian submersible... Fine.

529
00:42:47,543 --> 00:42:49,487
It's a Russian submersible.
No problem.

530
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:51,893
Yeah, but you think it
was something else.

531
00:42:53,289 --> 00:42:53,914
What?

532
00:42:55,695 --> 00:42:56,686
One of ours?

533
00:43:00,074 --> 00:43:00,940
No.

534
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:02,721
Well, whose then?

535
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,130
Come on, Lindsey. Talk to me.

536
00:43:07,978 --> 00:43:10,259
Look, Jammer saw
something down there.

537
00:43:10,645 --> 00:43:14,331
- Something that scared the hell out of him.
- His mixture got screwed up.

538
00:43:14,418 --> 00:43:18,191
Jammer panicked. He pranged his regulator
and his mixture got screwed up.

539
00:43:18,277 --> 00:43:20,635
But what did he see
that made him panic?

540
00:43:22,493 --> 00:43:24,485
Well, what do you think he saw?

541
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:27,218
I don't know.

542
00:43:28,633 --> 00:43:32,416
- Did any of you see it?
- No, sir. The Brigman woman saw it.

543
00:43:33,484 --> 00:43:34,725
Could have been a Russian bogey.

544
00:43:35,977 --> 00:43:37,805
CINCLANTFLT's gonna go apeshit.

545
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:43,484
Two Russian attack subs, a Tango and a
Victor, were tracked to within 50 miles of here.

546
00:43:43,532 --> 00:43:46,323
And now they don't know
where the hell they are. OK.

547
00:43:48,103 --> 00:43:52,001
I don't have any choice.
I'm confirming you to go to Phase 2.

548
00:43:52,723 --> 00:43:56,428
You'll recover one warhead, arm it,
and wait for further instructions.

549
00:43:57,728 --> 00:43:59,893
- Have we got a problem with that?
- Negative, sir.

550
00:44:03,117 --> 00:44:03,887
Come on!

551
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:05,764
- What did he say?
- Turn it up, bozo!

552
00:44:05,912 --> 00:44:08,545
...early reports that
the Montana encountered

553
00:44:08,546 --> 00:44:11,350
a Soviet fast attack sub
prior to its sinking...

554
00:44:10,961 --> 00:44:14,118
...and the Kremlin continues
to deny any involvement.

555
00:44:14,459 --> 00:44:16,095
That's us! That's us, man!

556
00:44:16,191 --> 00:44:19,800
Benthic Petroleum are apparently participating
in the recovery operation...

557
00:44:19,848 --> 00:44:22,457
...but we have little information
about their involvement.

558
00:44:23,169 --> 00:44:24,179
We want names!

559
00:44:25,036 --> 00:44:28,264
- Hey, that's the Explorer! We're famous!
- Quiet!

560
00:44:28,568 --> 00:44:30,916
There is a tremendous amount of activity.

561
00:44:31,205 --> 00:44:35,825
With Cuba only 80 miles away,
the massive build-up of American forces...

562
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:39,290
...has drawn official protest
from Havana and Moscow.

563
00:44:39,867 --> 00:44:43,621
Russian and Cuban trawlers,
undoubtedly surveillance vessels...

564
00:44:43,669 --> 00:44:45,642
...have been circling the area...

565
00:44:45,738 --> 00:44:49,540
- ...and Soviet aircraft have repeatedly been warned away.
- This sucks!

566
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:53,774
- Hippy, what's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with me? Nothing!

567
00:44:54,015 --> 00:44:56,546
We're just in the middle
of some big-time international incident...

568
00:44:56,633 --> 00:45:00,030
- ...like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something!
- Figured that out for yourself, did you Hip?

569
00:45:00,223 --> 00:45:02,244
You know, we got Russian
subs creeping around.

570
00:45:02,581 --> 00:45:06,151
Anything goes wrong,
they could say whatever they want happened.

571
00:45:06,421 --> 00:45:08,634
Relax, will you?
You're making the women nervous.

572
00:45:08,654 --> 00:45:10,896
- Cute, Virgil.
- You know, you know...

573
00:45:10,983 --> 00:45:14,352
...those SEALs ain't tellin' us diddly.
Something is goin' on!

574
00:45:14,438 --> 00:45:17,970
- Come on, come on.
- Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.

575
00:45:18,047 --> 00:45:20,049
Everything is.

576
00:45:20,348 --> 00:45:22,215
Hurry up, Coffey's splitting with Flatbed!

577
00:45:22,609 --> 00:45:25,131
I showed him how to work the controls
and they're outta here!

578
00:45:25,429 --> 00:45:27,537
- Didn't you tell him we need it right now?
- Yeah! He didn't pay any attention!

579
00:45:27,585 --> 00:45:29,876
- Where the hell is he takin' it?
- I have no idea!

580
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,117
Shit!

581
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:35,159
Coffey! Come back! We need...

582
00:45:35,236 --> 00:45:38,114
...the big arm to unhook the umbilical.

583
00:45:38,201 --> 00:45:40,520
There's a goddamn hurricane coming!

584
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,167
- He switched off.
- It's unbelievable.

585
00:45:45,188 --> 00:45:49,914
Go back down and tell those men
to get below and stay there!

586
00:46:00,635 --> 00:46:02,396
We need to get unhooked
and get out of here now!

587
00:46:02,955 --> 00:46:05,842
- All right. Do it, then.
- No problem, except your boys...

588
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:09,528
...went sightseeing with Flatbed. My people
need Flatbed to get unhooked at their end.

589
00:46:10,169 --> 00:46:12,104
- Back in 2 hours.
- 2 hours?!

590
00:46:12,412 --> 00:46:15,453
We're gonna get the shit kicked out of us
by our pal Fred in 2 hours!

591
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:24,509
OK. Set cold tab fitting to 200 psi.

592
00:46:24,596 --> 00:46:27,031
- Set.
- There she goes.

593
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,485
- She's breakin' loose.
- Bringin' her up.

594
00:46:29,986 --> 00:46:31,574
OK.

595
00:46:31,949 --> 00:46:32,642
All right.

596
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,500
'K Clear the hatch.

597
00:46:35,866 --> 00:46:36,925
Go on with it.

598
00:46:37,598 --> 00:46:38,753
Go on. That's it. Up.

599
00:46:39,042 --> 00:46:41,833
Sir, the missile looks intact.

600
00:46:42,218 --> 00:46:45,375
Little is known about the events
leading up to the collision.

601
00:46:44,571 --> 00:46:46,968
The US Navy guided missile cruiser Appleton...

602
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:51,799
...apparently struck the Soviet Udaloy class
destroyer in low visibility conditions.

603
00:46:52,405 --> 00:46:56,563
In violent seas, little hope remains
for over 100 Russian crewmen...

604
00:46:56,621 --> 00:47:00,422
...still missing after the sinking an hour ago.
Soviet military spokesmen...

605
00:47:00,471 --> 00:47:04,980
...have claimed that the collision
constituted an unprovoked attack.

606
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,876
This was denied by state
department officials...

607
00:47:05,877 --> 00:47:07,372
Bud, this is big time.

608
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:10,689
...who said that Captain Michael
Sweeney was acting correctly...

609
00:47:10,663 --> 00:47:13,175
- OK. It's clear.
- It's all yours, sir.

610
00:47:15,095 --> 00:47:16,818
I'm gonna swing it away and drop it.

611
00:47:17,299 --> 00:47:19,657
Check. OK.

612
00:47:20,812 --> 00:47:23,362
Bypass the ground connection
on the separation sequencer.

613
00:47:24,613 --> 00:47:27,789
- Got it?
- Separation sequencer disconnected.

614
00:47:29,474 --> 00:47:31,254
Remove explosive bolts 1 through 6...

615
00:47:31,302 --> 00:47:34,382
- ...in counterclockwise sequence.
- Check. Removing bolt 1.

616
00:47:43,313 --> 00:47:47,019
Negotiators have walked out
of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks...

617
00:47:47,038 --> 00:47:49,223
...in protest over the
incident this morning.

618
00:47:49,444 --> 00:47:53,409
The sudden deterioration of relations
with the United States and the Soviet...

619
00:47:53,438 --> 00:47:56,239
Soviet build-up of tanks
and aircraft has continued.

620
00:47:56,326 --> 00:47:59,013
...Eastern-Time this morning,
all US and NATO military forces

621
00:47:59,014 --> 00:48:00,772
have been put on full alert.

622
00:48:00,801 --> 00:48:01,908
It's on every channel.

623
00:48:02,028 --> 00:48:03,847
Well, you just feel so helpless.

624
00:48:04,795 --> 00:48:07,490
You can see it coming,
but what can you do?

625
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:08,582
What can anyone do?

626
00:48:09,409 --> 00:48:11,536
Hey, I mean, they love their kids too.

627
00:48:12,893 --> 00:48:14,193
So why are we doing this?

628
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,713
If it happens, it happens.

629
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:18,302
There's nothing I can
do about it, right?

630
00:48:20,083 --> 00:48:21,238
I just don't think about it.

631
00:48:35,482 --> 00:48:37,479
All right! Let's get
their gear off!

632
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,524
Then clear the sub! We
gotta get it outta here!

633
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:43,181
Come on, let's go! Let's move it!
One Night, you're up!

634
00:48:43,566 --> 00:48:44,721
Get ready to roll, baby!

635
00:48:44,798 --> 00:48:47,416
- Don't touch that! Just back away.
- Excuse moi!

636
00:48:50,592 --> 00:48:52,709
Hey, Coffey. We're a little
pressed for time.

637
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:57,954
Prick.

638
00:48:59,157 --> 00:49:01,179
This ain't no drill, Slick.
Make me proud.

639
00:49:01,207 --> 00:49:02,189
Piece of cake, baby.

640
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,008
What's the problem, One Night?

641
00:49:38,043 --> 00:49:40,749
All hell must be breaking loose up there.
This cable's pissin' me off!

642
00:49:42,144 --> 00:49:45,898
- I can't get a grip on it.
- Well, keep tryin', baby. Just keep tryin'.

643
00:49:47,438 --> 00:49:48,689
Son of a bitch!

644
00:49:50,181 --> 00:49:52,491
Shit! We got a problem!

645
00:49:52,924 --> 00:49:55,234
- What's going on?
- We're losing number 2 thruster!

646
00:49:55,426 --> 00:49:56,581
Bearing's going!

647
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:01,489
It's not holding!
We're swinging out of position here!

648
00:50:11,691 --> 00:50:12,894
Jesus!

649
00:50:20,953 --> 00:50:21,819
Shit!

650
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:33,705
The rig is movin'!

651
00:50:33,994 --> 00:50:35,507
Yeah, I can see that. Topside!

652
00:50:35,508 --> 00:50:38,181
Topside, pay out some
slack! We're gettin' dragged!

653
00:50:38,219 --> 00:50:39,465
- Down on number 1 winch!
- We're gettin' dragged!

654
00:50:39,466 --> 00:50:41,309
Down on 1!

655
00:50:46,939 --> 00:50:48,238
Bud, we're headed right
for the drop-off!

656
00:51:17,304 --> 00:51:20,720
What the hell?
We just lost all the topside feeds!

657
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:25,773
Shit! Get 'em on the UQC.

658
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,468
- Any damage on the hull?
- Bud!

659
00:51:30,104 --> 00:51:32,269
- We lost the crane!
- Say again. What?

660
00:51:32,414 --> 00:51:34,984
The crane!
We've lost the crane!

661
00:51:35,109 --> 00:51:37,082
It's on its way down to you!

662
00:51:38,256 --> 00:51:40,739
All right, everybody!
Everybody rig for impact!

663
00:51:41,701 --> 00:51:43,481
Close all the exterior hatches!
Let's move it!

664
00:51:43,482 --> 00:51:45,262
- Let's go!
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

665
00:51:48,101 --> 00:51:49,641
- Wait!
- Get in here!

666
00:51:52,914 --> 00:51:55,801
- What the hell is goin' on around here!?
- I don't know!

667
00:52:03,452 --> 00:52:05,473
You two help secure the rig! Let's go!

668
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:15,728
One Night! One Night!
You gotta get the hell outta there!

669
00:52:15,729 --> 00:52:17,437
The crane's comin' down!

670
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:27,735
I'm OK. I'm clear, Bud.

671
00:52:38,899 --> 00:52:40,583
I've got it! It's headed
straight for us!

672
00:53:44,152 --> 00:53:45,018
Oh, shit!

673
00:53:57,434 --> 00:54:00,032
- Oh no! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No!
- Oh my God.

674
00:54:01,139 --> 00:54:01,957
Bud?

675
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:03,257
Grab onto something!

676
00:54:08,935 --> 00:54:09,945
Jesus!

677
00:54:18,271 --> 00:54:20,965
- Battery room's flooding! Let's go!
- Cat, put that out!

678
00:54:23,949 --> 00:54:27,029
- Bud! The drill room's floodin'!
- Get back down there!

679
00:54:30,397 --> 00:54:32,178
Go! I'll take the battery room!

680
00:54:32,851 --> 00:54:33,718
Jesus!

681
00:54:50,416 --> 00:54:51,378
Shit!

682
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:57,153
- Get out of there!
- Close the door!

683
00:54:57,297 --> 00:54:58,308
Seal the room!

684
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:09,424
Lindsey!
Let's get outta here!

685
00:55:57,757 --> 00:55:59,422
- Hold this on me!
- OK!

686
00:56:05,005 --> 00:56:05,726
Lindsey!

687
00:56:05,937 --> 00:56:06,707
I got it!

688
00:56:28,025 --> 00:56:29,757
Let's get the hell outta here!

689
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:37,264
Let's go!

690
00:56:37,312 --> 00:56:40,585
Hit the door! Hit the door!

691
00:56:43,183 --> 00:56:45,541
No!

692
00:56:46,648 --> 00:56:48,958
Bud! Bud!

693
00:56:57,138 --> 00:57:00,507
Finler, cut the hose!
Cut the line to the motor!

694
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:02,865
I can't open it from out here!

695
00:57:03,279 --> 00:57:05,367
Finler, cut the hose!

696
00:57:08,014 --> 00:57:09,554
Finler!

697
00:57:33,422 --> 00:57:36,165
Hey! Hey!!!

698
00:57:37,233 --> 00:57:38,090
Hey!

699
00:57:38,783 --> 00:57:40,304
Hey!!!

700
00:57:42,228 --> 00:57:45,501
- Come on, Sonny!
- Hey, Cat! Cat, help me out, man!

701
00:57:45,886 --> 00:57:46,752
Hang on!

702
00:57:49,543 --> 00:57:53,248
The hose! Cut the hose!
The line to the motor! Hurry up, man!

703
00:57:57,627 --> 00:57:58,638
Come on, Cat!

704
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:00,852
Hurry!

705
00:58:01,862 --> 00:58:03,835
Come on, Sonny!
Help me out! Come on! Push!

706
00:58:08,407 --> 00:58:12,449
- Come on, Sonny! Let's go!
- Come on! Let's go! We gotta go! Go! Go!

707
00:58:12,882 --> 00:58:14,903
Get outta here! Come on! Move it!

708
00:58:14,932 --> 00:58:16,972
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

709
00:58:17,117 --> 00:58:18,079
Get the hatch, Cat!

710
00:58:18,801 --> 00:58:20,678
Get the hatch!
Get the hatch!

711
00:58:33,652 --> 00:58:35,336
- You all right? Everybody OK?
- Yeah.

712
00:58:36,828 --> 00:58:38,079
Son of a bitch!

713
00:58:38,705 --> 00:58:39,619
Oh, man!

714
00:58:46,552 --> 00:58:50,798
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.
This is Deepcore. Do you read me?

715
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:56,015
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.
This is Deepcore.

716
00:58:56,016 --> 00:58:58,460
Do you read me? Over.

717
00:58:58,979 --> 00:59:00,558
Forget it, Sonny.
They're gone, man.

718
00:59:04,456 --> 00:59:05,947
- Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
- Hey.

719
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:08,353
They're gone.

720
00:59:12,107 --> 00:59:13,069
OK?

721
00:59:15,601 --> 00:59:17,112
I just wanna get out of this.

722
00:59:20,894 --> 00:59:23,127
I'd just like to see my
wife one more time.

723
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:26,110
Well, all right, then.
You'd better keep trying, huh?

724
00:59:28,574 --> 00:59:31,548
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
This is Deepcore 2. Do you read?

725
00:59:33,021 --> 00:59:35,027
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.
Do you read me?

726
00:59:35,028 --> 00:59:37,034
This is Deepcore 2. Over.

727
00:59:38,218 --> 00:59:42,375
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
Deepcore 2 do you read me? Over.

728
01:00:07,976 --> 01:00:09,035
Hey, Jammer.

729
01:00:13,991 --> 01:00:17,119
- You got the shakes.
- I know what I got.

730
01:00:17,254 --> 01:00:19,135
I'll deal with it, all right?
I'll deal with me.

731
01:00:19,136 --> 01:00:21,017
You deal with yourself.

732
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:22,831
Find your buddy?

733
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,247
- No.
- Tighter, tighter.

734
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:28,990
- Brigman.
- What?

735
01:00:31,348 --> 01:00:32,503
I was under orders.

736
01:00:33,369 --> 01:00:34,236
I had no choice.

737
01:00:50,549 --> 01:00:51,704
How's it going, Cat?

738
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:04,745
- What's the scoop, ace?
- Well...

739
01:01:04,947 --> 01:01:09,028
...I can get power to this module
and sub-bay if I reroute these buses.

740
01:01:09,316 --> 01:01:12,589
But I gotta get past the mains,
which are a total meltdown.

741
01:01:14,321 --> 01:01:16,438
Bud, there won't be enough
to run the heaters.

742
01:01:17,285 --> 01:01:19,807
In a few hours, this place
is gonna be as cold as a meat locker.

743
01:01:21,058 --> 01:01:23,945
- What about O2?
- Yeah, well, brace yourself.

744
01:01:23,993 --> 01:01:26,020
If we close off the
sections we're not using,

745
01:01:26,021 --> 01:01:27,651
we have about maybe
12 hours' worth.

746
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:33,473
The storm's gonna last
a lot longer than 12 hours.

747
01:01:33,964 --> 01:01:34,869
Yeah, well...

748
01:01:35,793 --> 01:01:38,237
...I can maybe extend that. Maybe.

749
01:01:39,296 --> 01:01:42,232
There are some storage tanks outboard
next to the wrecked module.

750
01:01:42,703 --> 01:01:44,590
I'll have to go outside, though,
and tie onto them.

751
01:01:48,978 --> 01:01:49,777
Hey, Lins.

752
01:01:51,076 --> 01:01:52,597
- Lins.
- Yeah?

753
01:01:53,781 --> 01:01:54,791
I'm glad you're here.

754
01:01:55,609 --> 01:01:56,427
Yeah?

755
01:01:59,026 --> 01:02:00,085
I'm not.

756
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:30,450
Hey. Found Cab 3.
Deader than dog shit, boss.

757
01:02:30,806 --> 01:02:33,481
That girder went right through the brainpan.

758
01:02:33,529 --> 01:02:34,829
Yeah, I see that.

759
01:02:38,149 --> 01:02:40,844
- Where are you?
- Living quarters. Level 2.

760
01:02:48,399 --> 01:02:49,698
Ah jeez!

761
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:53,327
That's Perry.

762
01:02:58,216 --> 01:03:00,814
That's it, then.
Finler, McWhirter, Dietz and Perry.

763
01:03:02,884 --> 01:03:03,990
Jesus.

764
01:03:06,252 --> 01:03:08,321
Uh... we just leave 'em there?

765
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:10,983
Yeah, for now.
We got no choice.

766
01:03:10,984 --> 01:03:12,749
Our first priority is to get
somethin' to breathe.

767
01:03:23,624 --> 01:03:25,068
Where are you now, Lins?

768
01:03:26,271 --> 01:03:28,532
I'm under the starboard tri-module.

769
01:03:31,227 --> 01:03:33,778
- Still with me, Hip?
- Right behind you, Lins.

770
01:03:43,841 --> 01:03:47,133
- How's it look?
- Well, you guys really screwed up my rig.

771
01:03:47,181 --> 01:03:50,502
- There's a lot of wreckage out here.
- Well, don't get fouled.

772
01:03:50,983 --> 01:03:53,870
- Hey hit me with that 9/16ths, OK?
- Yeah.

773
01:03:54,447 --> 01:03:56,805
Thank you. So...

774
01:03:57,393 --> 01:03:59,837
- ...there you were.
- Yeah, there we were.

775
01:04:01,377 --> 01:04:04,072
Side by side on the same ship
for 2 months.

776
01:04:05,227 --> 01:04:08,403
I'm a tool pusher and we're testing
this automated derrick of hers.

777
01:04:09,895 --> 01:04:12,012
We get back on the beach
and we're livin' together.

778
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:13,985
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.

779
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,347
Yeah, well we were
due to go back out

780
01:04:16,348 --> 01:04:17,883
on the same ship.
6 months of tests.

781
01:04:17,931 --> 01:04:19,707
If you were married,
you got a stateroom.

782
01:04:19,708 --> 01:04:20,722
Otherwise it was bunks.

783
01:04:20,963 --> 01:04:23,338
OK. Good reason. Will you come over here

784
01:04:23,339 --> 01:04:25,534
and tighten this for me?
Then what?

785
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,277
Then it was all right
there for a while, you know.

786
01:04:29,576 --> 01:04:31,670
Then she got promoted to
chief engineer on this thing

787
01:04:31,705 --> 01:04:32,849
a couple years ago.

788
01:04:33,763 --> 01:04:37,276
- She went front office on you, man.
- Yeah, well, you know Lindsey.

789
01:04:38,325 --> 01:04:39,923
She's just too damn aggressive.

790
01:04:40,307 --> 01:04:41,751
Son of a bitch!

791
01:04:43,484 --> 01:04:45,649
She didn't leave me.
She just left me behind.

792
01:04:46,563 --> 01:04:48,584
Bud, let me tell you somethin'.

793
01:04:49,402 --> 01:04:51,905
She ain't half as smart
as she thinks she is.

794
01:04:56,043 --> 01:04:57,102
Get outta here.

795
01:05:31,076 --> 01:05:33,145
Come on. Let's see those muscles.

796
01:05:34,637 --> 01:05:36,177
Bingo! That's 1.

797
01:05:37,649 --> 01:05:38,631
2 for 2.

798
01:05:38,785 --> 01:05:40,027
Hey, hey.

799
01:05:41,917 --> 01:05:43,765
Lindsey, do you read me? Over.

800
01:05:44,824 --> 01:05:46,893
Copy you, Hippy.
What's the matter?

801
01:05:48,664 --> 01:05:51,946
Oh, shit.
The power's jackin' around with us again.

802
01:05:52,379 --> 01:05:53,389
Lindsey, come back.

803
01:05:53,717 --> 01:05:56,565
I just lost video. Lins, are you there?

804
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:00,078
Hippy, do you copy?

805
01:06:03,495 --> 01:06:04,746
Lins, you copy?

806
01:06:05,372 --> 01:06:07,056
Oh, shit!

807
01:06:07,489 --> 01:06:10,232
Oh, what the hell! Hippy, do you copy?

808
01:06:11,964 --> 01:06:13,119
Damn it!

809
01:06:14,082 --> 01:06:15,525
Bud, do you copy? Over.

810
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,530
Uh... I seem to be having
a problem here.

811
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:34,386
Shit!

812
01:08:47,715 --> 01:08:48,630
Damn it!

813
01:09:20,583 --> 01:09:23,470
- That's a great shot, Lins.
- You drop your dive light?

814
01:09:23,865 --> 01:09:25,857
Oh come on you guys, come on.

815
01:09:25,858 --> 01:09:27,849
Now that's the smaller one.
That's the smaller one here.

816
01:09:28,176 --> 01:09:30,544
- You can kinda see how it's zigging around.
- Yea, whatever it is.

817
01:09:30,775 --> 01:09:33,479
I'm telling you what it is.
You're just not hearing me.

818
01:09:33,527 --> 01:09:35,982
- Now, Lindsey you...
- There is something down there.

819
01:09:36,684 --> 01:09:40,842
- Something not us.
- You could be more... specific.

820
01:09:41,082 --> 01:09:42,670
- Something that zigs.
- Not us.

821
01:09:43,874 --> 01:09:45,125
Not human.

822
01:09:45,664 --> 01:09:49,215
Get it? Something non-human...
but intelligent.

823
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:58,069
A non-terrestrial intelligence.

824
01:09:58,608 --> 01:10:01,005
A non-terrestrial intelligence.

825
01:10:01,467 --> 01:10:05,625
NTIs. Oh, man, that's better than UFOs.
Oh but that works too huh.

826
01:10:05,961 --> 01:10:07,886
Underwater Flying Objects.

827
01:10:11,759 --> 01:10:14,801
- Are we talking little space friends here?
- Hell, yeah!

828
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:16,678
Hot rods of the gods!
Right, Lins?

829
01:10:17,678 --> 01:10:19,805
No, no, really.
It could be NTIs.

830
01:10:20,162 --> 01:10:21,322
The CIA has known
about 'em for ever.

831
01:10:21,323 --> 01:10:21,827
Step outside.

832
01:10:21,846 --> 01:10:24,170
They abduct people all the
time, man. There was once...

833
01:10:24,171 --> 01:10:25,532
Hippy, would you do me a favor?

834
01:10:25,965 --> 01:10:27,457
Stay off my side.

835
01:10:28,592 --> 01:10:30,392
- Will you step into my office, please?
- Certainly.

836
01:10:32,269 --> 01:10:34,483
I... come here.

837
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:37,865
Jesus, Lins!

838
01:10:37,866 --> 01:10:39,381
Oh Bud, come on! Something
really important is happening here.

839
01:10:39,391 --> 01:10:41,351
I'm trying to keep the
situation under control.

840
01:10:41,352 --> 01:10:43,433
I can't allow you to create
this kind of hysteria.

841
01:10:43,433 --> 01:10:46,032
- Who's hysterical?! Nobody's hysterical!
- Shh!

842
01:10:47,822 --> 01:10:50,127
All I'm saying is, when you're
hanging on by your fingernails,

843
01:10:50,128 --> 01:10:51,518
you don't go waving
your arms around.

844
01:10:51,633 --> 01:10:53,956
Look, I saw something.
I'm not gonna go in there

845
01:10:53,957 --> 01:10:56,185
and say I didn't see it
when I did. I'm sorry.

846
01:10:56,801 --> 01:10:57,211
Please.

847
01:10:57,212 --> 01:10:59,400
You are the most
stubborn woman I ever knew.

848
01:10:59,746 --> 01:11:01,142
Yes, I am!

849
01:11:01,719 --> 01:11:03,741
But I need you to believe me right now.

850
01:11:04,587 --> 01:11:07,735
Now, come on. Look at me. Come on.
Am I stressed out?

851
01:11:07,754 --> 01:11:10,718
Do I have any symptoms of pressure -
sickness, tremors, slurred speech?

852
01:11:12,412 --> 01:11:14,231
- No.
- No.

853
01:11:14,895 --> 01:11:17,022
Bud, this is me. Lindsey. OK?

854
01:11:18,158 --> 01:11:20,246
You know me better
than anybody in the world.

855
01:11:22,056 --> 01:11:23,663
Now watch my lips.

856
01:11:23,961 --> 01:11:25,732
I saw these things.

857
01:11:27,166 --> 01:11:28,597
I touched one of them.

858
01:11:28,598 --> 01:11:32,565
And... it wasn't some clunky
steel can like we would build.

859
01:11:34,875 --> 01:11:36,126
It glided.

860
01:11:37,166 --> 01:11:39,495
It was the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

861
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:43,104
Oh, God, I wish you'd been there.

862
01:11:44,548 --> 01:11:45,760
It was a machine.

863
01:11:45,895 --> 01:11:47,557
It was a machine,
but it was alive.

864
01:11:47,558 --> 01:11:49,504
It was like a...
like a dance of light.

865
01:11:52,565 --> 01:11:54,076
Please. You have to trust me.

866
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:56,700
Now, I don't think
they mean us any harm.

867
01:11:56,701 --> 01:11:57,907
I don't know how I know that.

868
01:11:58,523 --> 01:12:00,505
It's just... a feeling.

869
01:12:01,497 --> 01:12:05,654
Jesus! I'm supposed to go on a feeling?
How can I go on a feeling?

870
01:12:05,703 --> 01:12:09,215
- You think Coffey's gonna go on a feeling?
- Well, we all see what we wanna see.

871
01:12:10,486 --> 01:12:12,257
Coffey looks and he sees Russians.

872
01:12:13,113 --> 01:12:14,634
He sees hate and fear.

873
01:12:16,482 --> 01:12:18,686
You have to look with better eyes than that.

874
01:12:23,998 --> 01:12:25,250
Please.

875
01:12:26,096 --> 01:12:27,579
I can't, Lins.

876
01:12:29,359 --> 01:12:30,543
I'm sorry.

877
01:12:32,343 --> 01:12:35,490
All I want is 24 hour surveillance
on exterior cameras.

878
01:12:35,538 --> 01:12:38,040
- You've got 6 people. I've got...
- Comin' through!

879
01:12:39,282 --> 01:12:41,149
Everybody just stop!

880
01:12:47,838 --> 01:12:50,311
All right. I want
around-the-clock manning

881
01:12:50,312 --> 01:12:52,900
of the sonar shack and
the exterior cameras.

882
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,383
That Russian bogey comes back...

883
01:12:55,412 --> 01:12:58,559
- ...I don't think we should be taking a nap.
- Give me a break, Coffey.

884
01:12:58,973 --> 01:13:02,015
Those things live 3 and a half
miles down in an abyssal trench.

885
01:13:02,053 --> 01:13:04,142
Trust me, they're not speaking Russian.

886
01:13:08,646 --> 01:13:09,733
Have you finished the repairs...

887
01:13:09,753 --> 01:13:12,187
- ...on the acoustical transmitter yet?
- Nope.

888
01:13:13,516 --> 01:13:16,769
- Why not?
- I was having my nails done.

889
01:13:16,961 --> 01:13:18,511
Well, get it done.

890
01:13:18,944 --> 01:13:20,503
Kiss my ass.

891
01:13:32,495 --> 01:13:33,602
All right.

892
01:13:34,429 --> 01:13:35,969
Get something straight.

893
01:13:37,576 --> 01:13:39,386
You people are under my authority.

894
01:13:39,482 --> 01:13:41,253
Look, partner... look partner.

895
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:43,101
We don't work for you.

896
01:13:44,015 --> 01:13:45,613
We don't take orders from you.

897
01:13:46,758 --> 01:13:48,519
And we don't much like you.

898
01:13:51,859 --> 01:13:54,323
Hey, Cat... Cat!

899
01:13:55,978 --> 01:13:56,710
Yeah?

900
01:13:57,106 --> 01:14:00,061
Why don't you take
the first watch on sonar? OK?

901
01:14:01,996 --> 01:14:02,987
Right on.

902
01:14:04,363 --> 01:14:06,117
Sonny, you get a couple of hours' sleep.

903
01:14:06,118 --> 01:14:07,520
Then you spell Cat, all right?

904
01:14:08,213 --> 01:14:10,417
Hippy, you handle exterior surveillance.

905
01:14:12,467 --> 01:14:14,638
One Night...

906
01:14:14,639 --> 01:14:15,536
Will you do me a favor

907
01:14:15,537 --> 01:14:17,616
and see if you can get
that transmitter fixed?

908
01:14:18,549 --> 01:14:21,138
- All right?
- Give me a couple of hours.

909
01:14:30,397 --> 01:14:31,639
Got it.

910
01:14:53,553 --> 01:14:55,324
All right.

911
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:59,434
Come on, AJ Squared Away.
A little to the left.

912
01:15:00,425 --> 01:15:02,090
What is?

913
01:15:09,934 --> 01:15:12,253
Oh, this is not happening.

914
01:15:20,155 --> 01:15:24,139
Look at me, I'm shaking man. All right.
Wait wait wait wait. And now...

915
01:15:24,717 --> 01:15:28,124
...here's MIRV!

916
01:15:31,127 --> 01:15:33,018
Oh, come on, man!
What else could it be?

917
01:15:33,019 --> 01:15:34,909
Why bring it here?

918
01:15:35,438 --> 01:15:37,387
It's gotta be some
kind of emergency plan

919
01:15:37,388 --> 01:15:39,336
to keep it away from
the Russians, right?

920
01:15:39,442 --> 01:15:42,262
Look look... they hot-wire
one of the nukes.

921
01:15:42,483 --> 01:15:44,639
They use some kind of detonator
that they brought.

922
01:15:44,803 --> 01:15:49,230
Then they stick it back in the sub.
Fry the whole thing up. Bam!

923
01:15:49,471 --> 01:15:51,020
Slicker than snot.

924
01:15:53,012 --> 01:15:56,025
I'm tellin' you.
And I'm not being parano...

925
01:15:56,766 --> 01:15:58,065
Hi, Lins.

926
01:16:05,704 --> 01:16:07,400
Lins, will you just
wait a second?

927
01:16:07,401 --> 01:16:10,179
Goddamn it, If you don't
do something about it, I will!

928
01:16:10,227 --> 01:16:12,794
Lindsey, we'll do something
about it! Wait a sec!

929
01:16:12,795 --> 01:16:13,682
Fellas!? Hello!

930
01:16:14,096 --> 01:16:16,966
Lins! Just stop and think
about this for a second.

931
01:16:16,967 --> 01:16:17,724
About what?

932
01:16:37,945 --> 01:16:40,794
You know, you've got some huevos
bringing that thing into my rig.

933
01:16:42,478 --> 01:16:45,789
With all that's goin' on up in the world,
you bring a nuclear weapon...

934
01:16:45,837 --> 01:16:47,531
- ...in here!
- Mrs. Brigman...

935
01:16:47,781 --> 01:16:51,679
Does this strike anyone
as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?

936
01:16:51,997 --> 01:16:55,510
Mrs. Brigman, you don't need to know
the details of our operation.

937
01:16:55,558 --> 01:16:58,301
- It's better if you don't.
- You're right! I don't need to know!

938
01:16:58,349 --> 01:17:00,509
What I need to know is
that thing is off this rig!

939
01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:02,670
Do you hear me, Roger Ramjet!?

940
01:17:04,691 --> 01:17:07,145
You're becoming
a serious impediment to our mission.

941
01:17:07,684 --> 01:17:09,940
Now, you either do
an about-face and walk

942
01:17:09,941 --> 01:17:12,304
out of here, or I'll
have you escorted out.

943
01:17:12,352 --> 01:17:15,297
I will not do an about-face
and get outta here!

944
01:17:15,413 --> 01:17:17,764
Who the hell do you
think you're talking to?

945
01:17:17,765 --> 01:17:20,966
Emergency! Maintenance Room B!
Emergency! Everybody move it!

946
01:17:21,014 --> 01:17:22,121
On the double!

947
01:17:22,169 --> 01:17:23,468
Now! Now!

948
01:17:23,998 --> 01:17:27,310
In here! Come on! We
got trouble! Now! Come on!

949
01:17:27,311 --> 01:17:28,569
What's goin' on?

950
01:17:28,665 --> 01:17:30,109
All right! All right!
All right! All right!

951
01:17:31,793 --> 01:17:33,136
What's up?
What's happening?

952
01:17:33,137 --> 01:17:35,017
All right, you let
her go, man. Do it.

953
01:17:35,749 --> 01:17:37,125
Do it now!

954
01:17:37,568 --> 01:17:38,588
Let her go.

955
01:17:41,764 --> 01:17:43,400
The smartest thing you ever did.

956
01:17:46,721 --> 01:17:48,982
- Coffey, you son of a bitch!
- Lindsey! Cool it.

957
01:17:49,146 --> 01:17:50,787
What's the problem?

958
01:17:50,788 --> 01:17:54,382
Nothing. We were just
leaving. Weren't we?

959
01:18:13,485 --> 01:18:14,486
We don't need them.

960
01:18:16,199 --> 01:18:17,575
We can't trust them.

961
01:18:22,195 --> 01:18:23,879
We may have to take steps.

962
01:18:26,564 --> 01:18:28,412
We're gonna have to take steps.

963
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:36,439
Lins, I want you to stay away
from that guy. I mean it.

964
01:18:36,583 --> 01:18:39,278
The guy is gone.
Did you see his hands?

965
01:18:39,904 --> 01:18:41,732
What? He's got the shakes?

966
01:18:41,838 --> 01:18:43,732
Look, he's operating on his own.

967
01:18:43,733 --> 01:18:46,159
He's cut off from his
chain of command.

968
01:18:46,207 --> 01:18:48,912
He's showing signs
of pressure-induced psychosis.

969
01:18:49,441 --> 01:18:51,174
And he's got a nuclear weapon.

970
01:18:52,463 --> 01:18:54,240
So, as a personal favor
to me, will you try

971
01:18:54,241 --> 01:18:56,213
to put your tongue in
neutral for a while? OK?

972
01:18:56,317 --> 01:19:00,163
I gotta tell you. I give this whole
thing a sphincter factor of about 9.5.

973
01:19:38,795 --> 01:19:41,884
You can just punch into his primary
guidance chip where you want him to go...

974
01:19:41,932 --> 01:19:45,205
- ...and he'll go there, right?
- No. Bad idea, Lindsey.

975
01:19:45,253 --> 01:19:46,600
Why, Hip? Come on.

976
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:48,609
Because even if it
could take the pressure

977
01:19:48,610 --> 01:19:50,662
at that depth, which
I don't think it can...

978
01:19:53,870 --> 01:19:53,870
...without the tether, you know what
would happen if it got down there?

979
01:19:53,905 --> 01:19:56,937
It would just sit like a... please...
it would just sit like a dumb shit.

980
01:19:57,380 --> 01:19:58,114
Yeah... something would have to pass

981
01:19:58,115 --> 01:20:00,328
in front of the camera
for you to see anything.

982
01:20:00,452 --> 01:20:04,040
I know. But we could get
lucky right? So we should go for it.

983
01:20:04,675 --> 01:20:06,224
I really ought to talk to Bud about this.

984
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:08,526
No way. This is between you and me.

985
01:20:08,527 --> 01:20:11,085
We get proof and then we tell
the others. Hippy, look.

986
01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:14,674
If we can prove to Coffey
that there aren't Russians down there...

987
01:20:15,088 --> 01:20:17,494
...maybe he'll ease off the
button a little bit.

988
01:20:18,457 --> 01:20:20,464
I gotta tell you man,
that guy scares me more

989
01:20:20,465 --> 01:20:22,518
than anything we're
gonna find down there.

990
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:27,773
He's a goddamn AJ squared
away jarhead robot!

991
01:20:30,593 --> 01:20:32,021
All right. All right.
Give me a couple of hours.

992
01:20:32,022 --> 01:20:32,720
I'll see what I can do.

993
01:20:32,913 --> 01:20:34,125
Great. Thanks.

994
01:20:42,713 --> 01:20:43,685
How's that?

995
01:20:48,131 --> 01:20:49,344
Thanks.

996
01:21:11,336 --> 01:21:13,463
Virgil, turn on your side.

997
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:44,136
All right. You're all set, big guy.

998
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:47,456
Hey, I told you to wipe
that grin off your face.

999
01:21:56,474 --> 01:21:57,898
Good night, little buddy.

1000
01:23:42,324 --> 01:23:42,988
Bud!

1001
01:23:43,392 --> 01:23:44,480
Bud! Get up!

1002
01:23:58,964 --> 01:23:59,792
Cat?

1003
01:24:02,439 --> 01:24:03,103
Cat!

1004
01:24:03,546 --> 01:24:05,865
Hey! Goddamn... leave me alone.

1005
01:24:15,067 --> 01:24:16,116
Bud!

1006
01:24:19,379 --> 01:24:20,871
No, wait. It's OK.

1007
01:24:21,727 --> 01:24:23,354
Sweet Christ almighty!

1008
01:24:23,354 --> 01:24:24,711
I think it likes you.

1009
01:24:44,537 --> 01:24:46,260
It's trying to communicate.

1010
01:24:48,386 --> 01:24:49,464
It's Bud.

1011
01:24:53,151 --> 01:24:55,845
- It's wonderful!
- It's me!

1012
01:24:59,262 --> 01:25:01,399
- No no no no no!
- Shh it's OK. It's OK.

1013
01:25:01,427 --> 01:25:02,756
What is it!?

1014
01:25:05,662 --> 01:25:07,067
Is it alive?

1015
01:25:10,763 --> 01:25:12,707
Lindsey, no...

1016
01:25:14,055 --> 01:25:15,412
Seawater.

1017
01:25:16,008 --> 01:25:17,288
Oh, man.

1018
01:25:30,580 --> 01:25:32,206
Come on! Come on!

1019
01:25:34,506 --> 01:25:36,219
- Hurry!
- Where the hell's it going?

1020
01:25:47,095 --> 01:25:49,203
Hurry! I think it's
headed for B module!

1021
01:25:50,656 --> 01:25:51,811
Lins, you see it?

1022
01:26:49,011 --> 01:26:52,139
So, raise your hand if you think
it was a Russian water tentacle.

1023
01:26:53,631 --> 01:26:54,651
Lieutenant?

1024
01:26:55,421 --> 01:26:57,038
No? Well...

1025
01:26:58,578 --> 01:26:59,675
...a breakthrough.

1026
01:27:00,782 --> 01:27:01,696
Hey, ace...

1027
01:27:01,917 --> 01:27:05,863
- ...you done impressing yourself?
- No way that thing could just be seawater.

1028
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:08,748
They must have learned to control water.

1029
01:27:08,749 --> 01:27:10,319
I mean, at a molecular level.

1030
01:27:10,589 --> 01:27:12,849
You know, they can plasticize it,
they can pulverize it,

1031
01:27:12,850 --> 01:27:14,236
do whatever they wanna do with it.

1032
01:27:14,381 --> 01:27:17,790
They can put it under
intelligent control.

1033
01:27:17,791 --> 01:27:23,245
Maybe... their whole technology's
based on that... controlling water.

1034
01:27:24,486 --> 01:27:27,229
Was it the same thing
that you saw the last time?

1035
01:27:27,470 --> 01:27:28,057
No.

1036
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:32,311
You know, I don't think that
that thing you saw was one of them.

1037
01:27:32,474 --> 01:27:35,564
- What are you talkin' about?
- I mean, I don't think it was an NTI.

1038
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:39,385
I think it was like their version of an ROV.
Like Big Geek.

1039
01:27:40,877 --> 01:27:42,753
Hippy, you mean
they was just checkin' us out?

1040
01:27:42,801 --> 01:27:44,774
- Yeah.
- How come?

1041
01:27:45,207 --> 01:27:46,343
Curious, I suppose.

1042
01:27:46,555 --> 01:27:48,051
We're probably the first people
they've ever seen right?

1043
01:27:48,052 --> 01:27:49,548
Who's been down this far?

1044
01:28:05,755 --> 01:28:09,307
It went straight for the warhead.
And they think it's cute!

1045
01:28:28,228 --> 01:28:29,624
You need to get some sleep.

1046
01:28:39,826 --> 01:28:41,356
We have no...

1047
01:28:41,664 --> 01:28:44,811
...way of warning the surface.

1048
01:28:45,552 --> 01:28:47,236
And you know what that means?

1049
01:28:50,364 --> 01:28:52,270
It means whatever happens...

1050
01:28:52,741 --> 01:28:54,801
...is up to us.

1051
01:28:55,667 --> 01:28:56,938
Us.

1052
01:30:02,999 --> 01:30:06,320
So you think they're from down there
originally? Or from...

1053
01:30:08,062 --> 01:30:08,995
...you know.

1054
01:30:10,708 --> 01:30:11,902
I don't know.

1055
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:14,645
I think... I think they're from,
'you know.'

1056
01:30:15,405 --> 01:30:17,041
Someplace with similar conditions.

1057
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:19,813
- Cold, intense pressure.
- Oh, man!

1058
01:30:19,996 --> 01:30:22,450
Happy as hogs in a waller down there,
probably.

1059
01:31:18,642 --> 01:31:19,912
Sniff something?

1060
01:31:23,916 --> 01:31:25,273
Did you, rat boy?

1061
01:31:30,479 --> 01:31:31,731
Hey! Hey! Hey! Come on!

1062
01:31:31,971 --> 01:31:33,078
Freeze!

1063
01:31:33,444 --> 01:31:34,666
Don't move!

1064
01:31:36,716 --> 01:31:37,630
That's right.

1065
01:31:39,170 --> 01:31:41,018
- You OK, Hip?
- They're using Big Geek...

1066
01:31:41,047 --> 01:31:43,694
- ...to take the bomb to the NTIs.
- What?

1067
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:45,801
We set it up to go right to 'em.

1068
01:31:46,215 --> 01:31:48,920
Oh my God! Oh my God!

1069
01:31:49,526 --> 01:31:51,797
Take this. We're going to Phase 3.

1070
01:31:52,587 --> 01:31:54,723
What!? We don't have orders for that!

1071
01:31:55,195 --> 01:31:57,013
I programmed Big Geek
to go down to the

1072
01:31:57,014 --> 01:31:59,064
bottom of the trench
and shoot some video.

1073
01:31:59,304 --> 01:32:01,614
- Now they got the warhead tied to it.
- Coffey.

1074
01:32:05,175 --> 01:32:05,613
Lins...

1075
01:32:05,614 --> 01:32:09,266
Coffey... no, come on, Coffey. Just
think about what you're doing, OK?

1076
01:32:09,612 --> 01:32:11,932
Just one minute. Just think
about what you're doing!

1077
01:32:12,076 --> 01:32:13,404
Get back!

1078
01:32:15,666 --> 01:32:18,977
This is something I've wanted
to do since we first met.

1079
01:32:25,993 --> 01:32:27,995
Come on. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

1080
01:32:30,968 --> 01:32:34,886
- All right! Into the kitchen! Let's go! Move!
- Get your damn hands off of me!

1081
01:32:34,972 --> 01:32:36,551
- Get in there!
- I know the way.

1082
01:32:36,830 --> 01:32:39,900
Your boss is fixin' to pull the pin
on 50 kilotons!

1083
01:32:40,535 --> 01:32:42,412
And we're all gonna be ringside!

1084
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:45,059
He's havin' a full-on meltdown!

1085
01:32:45,424 --> 01:32:47,253
- What's the timer set for?
- Three hours.

1086
01:32:47,282 --> 01:32:49,447
- Shut up! Don't talk.
- Three hours.

1087
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:52,469
We can't get to minimum safe
distance in three hours.

1088
01:32:54,048 --> 01:32:56,011
We can't go to Phase 3.
What about these people?

1089
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:58,302
Shut up! What's the matter with you?

1090
01:33:04,788 --> 01:33:08,465
Everybody just stay calm.
The situation is under control.

1091
01:33:13,604 --> 01:33:15,828
Anybody touches that door, kill 'em.

1092
01:33:20,630 --> 01:33:23,643
Shoenick! Your lieutenant's
about to make a real bad career move!

1093
01:33:23,662 --> 01:33:26,068
- The guy is crazier than a shithouse rat!
- Shut it!

1094
01:33:26,116 --> 01:33:27,444
- They're trying to make contact!

1095
01:33:27,444 --> 01:33:29,792
- Can't you see he's lost it?
- Shut up!

1096
01:33:29,908 --> 01:33:32,227
- The shock wave will kill us.
- Quiet!

1097
01:33:32,391 --> 01:33:34,383
It'll crush this rig like a beer can.

1098
01:33:34,393 --> 01:33:36,318
- Shut up, man! What are you talkin' about!?
- We gotta stop him.

1099
01:33:36,366 --> 01:33:37,694
Shut up!

1100
01:33:38,195 --> 01:33:41,409
This is not our mission.
We can't detonate without orders.

1101
01:33:55,223 --> 01:33:57,003
He's about to declare
war on an alien species...

1102
01:33:57,051 --> 01:33:59,910
...just when they're trying to
make contact with us. Please!

1103
01:34:00,324 --> 01:34:02,364
- I don't know. I think I'm reaching him.
- Yeah!

1104
01:34:05,867 --> 01:34:07,234
Ho ho ho.
I'll be damned.

1105
01:34:10,622 --> 01:34:12,864
- Jammer.
- Is everybody OK?

1106
01:34:13,422 --> 01:34:14,770
Oh, man!

1107
01:34:15,963 --> 01:34:18,976
- Don't move, jarface!
- Look, I'm the least of your problems.

1108
01:34:19,168 --> 01:34:20,867
- Take it easy, Hippy.
- I'm all right.

1109
01:34:20,868 --> 01:34:22,566
How you feeling, big guy?

1110
01:34:22,758 --> 01:34:24,336
I'm OK, Bud. I...

1111
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:28,002
...I just... I just figured
I was dead back there

1112
01:34:28,003 --> 01:34:30,409
when I saw that angel
coming for me.

1113
01:34:32,979 --> 01:34:36,569
Yeah, OK.
Yeah. Why don't you tell us about it later?

1114
01:34:43,114 --> 01:34:45,943
- Come on.
- He's got it tied off with something.

1115
01:34:46,299 --> 01:34:47,348
Yeah come on. Ready?

1116
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:56,207
We're not gonna be able to budge it.

1117
01:35:06,876 --> 01:35:09,282
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna swim to hatch 6.

1118
01:35:09,783 --> 01:35:10,447
What!?

1119
01:35:12,882 --> 01:35:13,825
I'm gonna get inside...

1120
01:35:14,431 --> 01:35:16,632
...and I'm gonna open the
door from the other side.

1121
01:35:16,633 --> 01:35:17,896
Bud, this water is freezing.

1122
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:20,976
Then I guess you'd better
wish me luck, huh?

1123
01:35:21,553 --> 01:35:23,401
- Wish us luck.
- You comin' along?

1124
01:35:23,411 --> 01:35:24,440
Looks that way.

1125
01:35:26,510 --> 01:35:28,868
- All right, Cat.
- Come on, Bud.

1126
01:35:30,119 --> 01:35:32,765
- In case I don't die...
- This is insane.

1127
01:35:33,016 --> 01:35:35,557
Come on, Bud.
Let's go, partner. I ain't got all day.

1128
01:36:33,784 --> 01:36:35,179
Come on. Yank on it.

1129
01:36:41,002 --> 01:36:42,301
We have to...

1130
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:44,707
...we have to go to the moon pool.

1131
01:36:45,718 --> 01:36:47,922
- It's the only way.
- I can't.

1132
01:36:48,307 --> 01:36:49,664
I can't make it, partner.

1133
01:36:50,434 --> 01:36:51,444
I'm sorry.

1134
01:36:53,851 --> 01:36:56,112
OK... OK Cat.

1135
01:36:56,353 --> 01:36:57,556
You head on back, all right?

1136
01:38:28,439 --> 01:38:30,990
- What is he doing?
- He can't make it to the door.

1137
01:38:31,278 --> 01:38:33,642
He's gonna try and
take him out himself.

1138
01:38:33,643 --> 01:38:35,677
No. God, he couldn't be that dumb.

1139
01:38:35,705 --> 01:38:37,101
That guy's a trained killer.

1140
01:39:24,934 --> 01:39:25,608
No!

1141
01:39:26,570 --> 01:39:28,880
Coffey... Coffey, listen.

1142
01:39:42,546 --> 01:39:43,268
Hey!

1143
01:41:00,244 --> 01:41:00,918
Hey!

1144
01:41:16,702 --> 01:41:18,819
- Bud, you all right?
- Get him, Cat!

1145
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:28,299
- He's dogged it, Bud!
- We gotta get this off of here.

1146
01:41:32,149 --> 01:41:34,411
Come on. Help me. Pull the gripper!

1147
01:41:45,479 --> 01:41:46,585
Cat, get the door!

1148
01:41:56,691 --> 01:41:57,374
Shit!

1149
01:41:58,616 --> 01:41:59,386
Come on!

1150
01:42:01,792 --> 01:42:02,321
Shoot!

1151
01:42:02,369 --> 01:42:03,332
You all right?

1152
01:42:03,669 --> 01:42:05,545
The safety's on! Safety's on!

1153
01:42:06,171 --> 01:42:07,278
Give me that!

1154
01:42:13,101 --> 01:42:16,036
Come on! Let's go! Help me out!
Gimme a hand. Let's move it.

1155
01:42:16,084 --> 01:42:18,635
- One Night, what about Cab 1?
- Ready to launch.

1156
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,917
Go! You're better in these than I am.

1157
01:42:23,832 --> 01:42:25,468
- You got air?
- Come on. Come on!

1158
01:42:27,787 --> 01:42:29,847
You got air. You got air.
You got air. You got air.

1159
01:43:19,605 --> 01:43:20,760
Shit!

1160
01:44:49,207 --> 01:44:50,507
Bud, get out of the way!

1161
01:44:57,629 --> 01:44:58,447
Shit!

1162
01:45:19,735 --> 01:45:21,996
Get in! Hurry up!

1163
01:45:22,478 --> 01:45:25,220
I'm comin', baby!
Keep your pantyhose on.

1164
01:45:34,652 --> 01:45:36,673
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

1165
01:45:40,090 --> 01:45:43,266
- Do you see Big Geek?
- Yeah. Right out in front.

1166
01:45:50,340 --> 01:45:51,832
- Oh, my God!
- Get after him.

1167
01:45:51,833 --> 01:45:53,324
OK. OK. OK. OK.
Get on the arm.

1168
01:45:53,949 --> 01:45:56,307
- To the left. A little more.
- You missed. Try it again.

1169
01:45:56,326 --> 01:45:58,242
- Stay steady. Steady. Steady. Steady.
- OK.

1170
01:45:58,251 --> 01:45:59,676
- Grab it!
- Yeah, got it!

1171
01:46:00,205 --> 01:46:02,226
- Pretty slick, Slick.
- Hold it really steady.

1172
01:46:02,784 --> 01:46:04,584
- Hold it still. Hold it still.
- I am. I am.

1173
01:46:15,508 --> 01:46:17,240
Shit! We lost Geek!

1174
01:46:24,073 --> 01:46:25,276
Where is he, Bud? Do you see him?

1175
01:46:25,324 --> 01:46:26,191
I'll take a look.

1176
01:46:28,789 --> 01:46:31,388
- He's comin' up fast. Step on it!
- Shit!

1177
01:46:41,926 --> 01:46:44,573
- Go to the right! Swing to the right!
- Shit!

1178
01:47:00,646 --> 01:47:01,656
Keep movin', baby!

1179
01:47:04,303 --> 01:47:05,188
Come here.

1180
01:47:11,714 --> 01:47:12,821
Son of a bitch!

1181
01:47:20,713 --> 01:47:22,676
Hard left, baby!
Left! Left! Left!

1182
01:47:36,256 --> 01:47:37,796
Jesus Christ, lady!

1183
01:47:37,844 --> 01:47:40,298
Bud, if you think you can do any better
then you're welcome up here!

1184
01:47:47,372 --> 01:47:48,719
Son of a bitch!

1185
01:47:51,125 --> 01:47:53,339
- Is he right on us?
- Yeah, he's right on your ass.

1186
01:47:53,445 --> 01:47:54,783
OK. OK.

1187
01:47:54,927 --> 01:47:56,563
- Where you goin'?
- Hang on!

1188
01:49:36,134 --> 01:49:38,155
Deepcore, this is Cab 1.
Do you read?

1189
01:49:41,484 --> 01:49:43,601
Deepcore, Deepcore,
this is Cab 1. Over.

1190
01:49:45,478 --> 01:49:46,777
I'm not getting any answer!

1191
01:49:48,731 --> 01:49:50,386
And we're flooding like a son of a bitch.

1192
01:49:50,713 --> 01:49:51,878
Yeah. You noticed?

1193
01:49:52,503 --> 01:49:54,476
You know, you did OK back there, Virgil.

1194
01:49:54,910 --> 01:49:57,316
- I was fairly impressed.
- Yeah, well, not good enough.

1195
01:49:57,835 --> 01:50:00,973
- We still gotta catch Big Geek.
- Yeah, well, not in this thing.

1196
01:50:01,647 --> 01:50:04,005
Deepcore, Deepcore,
this is Cab 1. Over.

1197
01:50:07,614 --> 01:50:08,480
Try it again.

1198
01:50:09,346 --> 01:50:11,300
Deepcore, this is Cab 1.
We need a...

1199
01:50:15,746 --> 01:50:16,564
You all right?

1200
01:50:17,459 --> 01:50:18,345
Yeah.

1201
01:50:24,697 --> 01:50:25,756
Well, that's that.

1202
01:50:25,775 --> 01:50:27,055
Yeah, wonderful.

1203
01:50:29,259 --> 01:50:31,388
There's some light
comin' from somewhere.

1204
01:50:31,389 --> 01:50:32,300
Off to the right.

1205
01:50:32,926 --> 01:50:34,273
Yeah, that's the rig.

1206
01:50:34,466 --> 01:50:36,631
It's a good 60, 70 yards, I'd say.

1207
01:50:37,112 --> 01:50:38,315
Well, they'll come after us.

1208
01:50:39,345 --> 01:50:41,401
Yeah, but it's gonna
take 'em a while to get here

1209
01:50:41,402 --> 01:50:43,320
We gotta get
this flooding stopped.

1210
01:50:45,919 --> 01:50:47,080
- Can you see where it's coming in?

1211
01:50:47,081 --> 01:50:48,373
- Yeah. Can you hold the lamp for me?

1212
01:50:49,143 --> 01:50:52,559
There's a busted fitting behind this panel.
Problem is I don't think I can get to it.

1213
01:50:56,168 --> 01:50:58,815
- You got any tools?
- Uh, I don't know. I'll have to look around.

1214
01:50:59,345 --> 01:51:00,836
Yeah, well, I looked already.

1215
01:51:03,627 --> 01:51:06,178
Goddamn it!
All I need's a goddamn crescent wrench!

1216
01:51:09,294 --> 01:51:10,112
Come on.

1217
01:51:16,128 --> 01:51:17,571
Son of a bitch!

1218
01:51:18,447 --> 01:51:20,459
OK. Calm down, Bud.

1219
01:51:21,180 --> 01:51:23,394
- Calm down.
- OK.
- OK.

1220
01:51:26,262 --> 01:51:27,388
OK.

1221
01:51:29,929 --> 01:51:31,479
We gotta get you outta here.

1222
01:51:32,152 --> 01:51:34,221
- How?
- I don't know how.

1223
01:51:34,606 --> 01:51:35,761
All right. We've only got one suit.

1224
01:51:35,762 --> 01:51:37,609
I know. I know. But we
gotta come up with something.

1225
01:51:37,685 --> 01:51:41,247
- Oh, my God! I'm freezing!
- Come here. Come here. Give me your hands.

1226
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:43,148
Listen, you're smart.
Think of something.

1227
01:51:43,149 --> 01:51:44,616
- Can't you think of something?
- OK. OK.

1228
01:51:45,415 --> 01:51:48,754
OK. Why don't you swim back to the rig
and bring back another suit?

1229
01:51:50,304 --> 01:51:56,021
That'll take me about 7, or 8 minutes
to swim, get the gear, and come back.

1230
01:51:56,791 --> 01:51:58,956
I wouldn't make it. Look at this.
By the time I got back, you'd be...

1231
01:52:00,977 --> 01:52:02,878
- OK. OK.
- Lins.

1232
01:52:02,879 --> 01:52:04,779
Let's look around.
Let's look. Oh my God!

1233
01:52:06,511 --> 01:52:07,464
Is that working?

1234
01:52:09,543 --> 01:52:10,313
Shit!

1235
01:52:21,525 --> 01:52:23,306
All right. All right. All right.
All right. All right.

1236
01:52:24,066 --> 01:52:25,904
Here. You put this on.

1237
01:52:25,952 --> 01:52:27,750
No! No! What, are you
growing gills all of a sudden?

1238
01:52:27,751 --> 01:52:29,417
Don't argue with me,
goddamn it! Just put it on.

1239
01:52:29,436 --> 01:52:31,912
Look, this is not an option, so
just forget about it! All right?

1240
01:52:31,913 --> 01:52:33,796
Lindsey, shut up! Shut
up and put this thing on!

1241
01:52:33,844 --> 01:52:35,090
- If you'd be logical just for one second...
- Fuck logic!

1242
01:52:35,091 --> 01:52:36,337
Please! Listen...

1243
01:52:36,587 --> 01:52:39,066
Just listen to me for one second.
Now, you've got the suit on...

1244
01:52:39,067 --> 01:52:40,966
...and you're a much better
swimmer than I am, right?

1245
01:52:41,390 --> 01:52:43,854
- Yeah, maybe.
- Right? Yes! So I've got a plan.

1246
01:52:43,959 --> 01:52:47,126
- What's the plan?
- I drown, and you tow me back to the rig.

1247
01:52:47,174 --> 01:52:48,185
No. No!

1248
01:52:48,521 --> 01:52:49,844
- Yes! This water's...
- No!

1249
01:52:49,845 --> 01:52:51,168
...is only a couple of degrees
above freezing.

1250
01:52:51,332 --> 01:52:55,210
I'll... go into deep hypothermia.
My blood will go like ice water.

1251
01:52:55,836 --> 01:52:58,338
Right? My body systems will slow down.
They won't stop.

1252
01:52:58,386 --> 01:52:58,938
Lins...

1253
01:52:58,939 --> 01:53:02,862
You tow me back and I can...
I can be revived after maybe...

1254
01:53:02,910 --> 01:53:05,556
- ...10 or 15 minutes.
- Lins, put this on! You put it on!

1255
01:53:05,941 --> 01:53:10,157
No, it's the only way! You just put this on!
Put this on. You know I'm right.

1256
01:53:10,398 --> 01:53:14,825
Please! It's the only way. You've got
all the... stuff on the rig to do this.

1257
01:53:15,239 --> 01:53:17,058
Put this on. Bud, please!

1258
01:53:18,501 --> 01:53:19,704
- This is insane.
- I know.

1259
01:53:20,570 --> 01:53:21,485
Oh, my God.

1260
01:53:22,303 --> 01:53:23,650
- Are you OK?
- It's the only way.

1261
01:53:24,468 --> 01:53:25,671
All right. Here. Hold this.

1262
01:53:29,232 --> 01:53:30,772
Son of a bitch. Hold on, Lindsey.

1263
01:53:33,708 --> 01:53:34,766
You can do this, you know.

1264
01:53:40,541 --> 01:53:42,899
- You can do this.
- God, Lins... I...

1265
01:53:42,995 --> 01:53:44,872
I know. You can tell me later.

1266
01:54:02,677 --> 01:54:04,602
This is maybe not
such a good idea!

1267
01:54:06,575 --> 01:54:08,211
Oh, my God!

1268
01:54:08,837 --> 01:54:10,713
Bud! No!

1269
01:54:19,616 --> 01:54:22,551
I can't! Oh, Bud,
I'm scared!

1270
01:54:52,627 --> 01:54:56,689
No!

1271
01:55:17,482 --> 01:55:18,531
I got him! I got him!

1272
01:55:18,781 --> 01:55:20,918
- Where?
- Oh, my God! It's Lindsey.

1273
01:55:20,937 --> 01:55:23,776
- Deepcore! Deepcore, do you read? Over.
- Yeah, we got you, Bud.

1274
01:55:23,824 --> 01:55:25,509
- We're here.
- Go to the infirmary.

1275
01:55:26,519 --> 01:55:29,214
Get the cart, oxygen, defib' kit...

1276
01:55:30,051 --> 01:55:31,701
...adrenaline in a 10cc syringe,

1277
01:55:31,702 --> 01:55:34,074
and some heating blankets.
You got all that?

1278
01:55:34,267 --> 01:55:34,661
Got it. Over

1279
01:55:34,662 --> 01:55:36,673
Meet me at the moon
pool and make it fast!

1280
01:55:36,769 --> 01:55:38,068
Now! Come on!
Let's go!

1281
01:55:38,550 --> 01:55:39,608
Hippy, get the hot packs!

1282
01:55:40,090 --> 01:55:40,860
Got 'em!

1283
01:55:57,365 --> 01:55:58,328
Here he comes!

1284
01:56:06,210 --> 01:56:07,904
- Watch her head. Watch her head.
- I got it. I got it.

1285
01:56:08,289 --> 01:56:09,059
Watch her feet.
Watch her feet.

1286
01:56:12,379 --> 01:56:13,679
Watch her head comin' down.
Watch her head.

1287
01:56:20,656 --> 01:56:22,244
Clear it out. Clear
it out. Is she clear?

1288
01:56:22,245 --> 01:56:23,255
- Come on!
- Is she clear?

1289
01:56:23,592 --> 01:56:25,613
Get the d-fib ready.
Hurry up, Cat.

1290
01:56:25,853 --> 01:56:27,297
OK. OK. Got it.

1291
01:56:29,126 --> 01:56:30,040
- OK?
- Yeah.

1292
01:56:31,946 --> 01:56:34,292
Three-one thousand, four-one
thousand, five-one thousand...

1293
01:56:34,293 --> 01:56:34,708
Breathe!

1294
01:56:36,642 --> 01:56:38,991
One-one thousand, two-one
thousand, three-one thousand...

1295
01:56:39,655 --> 01:56:41,974
N-N-N-No! You gotta have
bare skin or it won't work!

1296
01:56:42,917 --> 01:56:44,525
Three-one thousand, four-one thousand...

1297
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:46,690
Here.

1298
01:56:48,249 --> 01:56:49,086
Is that right? Is this it?

1299
01:56:49,096 --> 01:56:50,636
- Bud, I got it.
- Well, do it!

1300
01:56:51,358 --> 01:56:52,032
Breathe!

1301
01:56:53,302 --> 01:56:55,352
- Come on! Zap her!
- Clear!

1302
01:56:57,277 --> 01:56:59,394
- Come on, baby! Oh, Christ!
- Nothing.

1303
01:56:59,587 --> 01:57:00,357
Breathe.

1304
01:57:01,589 --> 01:57:05,169
- I'll jack it up to 300.
- Do it again, One Night. Zap her again.

1305
01:57:05,361 --> 01:57:07,334
It's going, it's going,
it's going. It's charging.

1306
01:57:08,152 --> 01:57:11,473
Charging... charging...
charging...

1307
01:57:11,521 --> 01:57:12,676
- Now!
- ...clear!

1308
01:57:14,649 --> 01:57:16,237
- Anything?
- No pulse.

1309
01:57:16,458 --> 01:57:18,643
- Come on, baby!
- Just charging 1 more time.

1310
01:57:18,980 --> 01:57:21,097
Zap her again. Come on!

1311
01:57:22,541 --> 01:57:23,648
- Come on!
- Clear!

1312
01:57:27,151 --> 01:57:28,267
God! No pulse.

1313
01:57:28,286 --> 01:57:30,673
Flat, it's flat. Goddamn! It's flat.

1314
01:57:30,721 --> 01:57:31,732
Get outta here.

1315
01:57:33,310 --> 01:57:36,159
One, two, three, four,
five-one thousand.

1316
01:57:36,544 --> 01:57:38,950
One, two, three, four... breathe!

1317
01:57:39,470 --> 01:57:42,126
One, two, three, four... breathe!

1318
01:57:50,249 --> 01:57:52,569
Come on, baby.
One-one thousand, two-one thousand...

1319
01:57:52,617 --> 01:57:54,311
...three-one thousand,
four-one thousand...

1320
01:57:55,494 --> 01:57:57,573
...come on, baby. One-one
thousand, two-one thousand,

1321
01:57:57,574 --> 01:57:59,883
three-one thousand, four-one
thousand, five-one thousand...

1322
01:57:59,979 --> 01:58:01,396
...come on, baby!
Breathe! Come on!

1323
01:58:01,397 --> 01:58:03,348
- Two-one thousand, three-one thousand...
- Bud...

1324
01:58:04,118 --> 01:58:05,898
Bud... Bud...

1325
01:58:08,523 --> 01:58:09,870
It's all over, man.

1326
01:58:12,632 --> 01:58:13,768
It's all over.

1327
01:58:14,826 --> 01:58:15,885
I'm sorry.

1328
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:18,195
No pulse.

1329
01:58:40,283 --> 01:58:41,342
NO!!!

1330
01:58:41,938 --> 01:58:44,181
No, she has a strong heart!
She wants to live!

1331
01:58:44,710 --> 01:58:46,394
Come on, Lins! Come on, baby!

1332
01:59:19,165 --> 01:59:21,668
- Zap her again! Do it!
- Charging.

1333
01:59:21,687 --> 01:59:22,678
Do it!
- Charging.

1334
01:59:29,559 --> 01:59:30,195
Clear.

1335
01:59:30,637 --> 01:59:31,484
Clear!

1336
01:59:34,555 --> 01:59:35,575
Get outta here!

1337
01:59:42,899 --> 01:59:45,632
Come on. Breathe, baby.
Goddamn it! Breathe!

1338
01:59:46,412 --> 01:59:48,016
Goddamn it, you bitch!
You never backed...

1339
01:59:48,017 --> 01:59:49,867
...away from anything in
your life! Now fight!

1340
01:59:50,367 --> 01:59:52,052
Fight! Fight!

1341
01:59:52,215 --> 01:59:53,861
Right now! Do it!

1342
01:59:54,564 --> 01:59:56,026
Fight, goddamn it!

1343
01:59:57,826 --> 01:59:58,760
Fight!

1344
01:59:58,875 --> 01:59:59,587
Fight!

1345
01:59:59,684 --> 02:00:00,887
Fight!

1346
02:00:09,847 --> 02:00:11,425
Lins? That's it, Lindsey.

1347
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:13,302
That's it, Lins.
You can do it.

1348
02:00:13,908 --> 02:00:16,334
That's it, Lins. Come on
back, baby. Come on.

1349
02:00:16,805 --> 02:00:17,874
You can do it, baby.

1350
02:00:28,701 --> 02:00:29,567
Get her some air.

1351
02:00:31,617 --> 02:00:32,503
Breathe Lindsey.

1352
02:00:36,478 --> 02:00:37,719
You did it, ace!

1353
02:00:53,436 --> 02:00:55,457
- Make sure... Make sure her heart's good.
- OK.

1354
02:01:11,289 --> 02:01:13,195
Big boys don't cry, remember?

1355
02:01:19,547 --> 02:01:20,509
Hi, lady.

1356
02:01:22,617 --> 02:01:23,733
Hi, tough guy.

1357
02:01:27,872 --> 02:01:29,316
I guess it worked, didn't it?

1358
02:01:29,604 --> 02:01:30,904
Yeah. Of course it did.

1359
02:01:33,117 --> 02:01:34,513
You're never wrong, are you?

1360
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:38,555
How you feelin'?

1361
02:01:40,412 --> 02:01:41,683
I feel better.

1362
02:01:43,078 --> 02:01:44,522
What did you do to me?

1363
02:01:50,990 --> 02:01:52,818
Next time it's your turn, OK?

1364
02:01:56,023 --> 02:01:57,428
Yeah, you got that right.

1365
02:01:58,477 --> 02:02:00,409
OK, these are so your
eyes can focus...

1366
02:02:00,410 --> 02:02:02,664
...in the breathing fluid.
How's that feel?

1367
02:02:04,002 --> 02:02:05,984
If you can't see, you can't
disarm the bomb right?

1368
02:02:06,514 --> 02:02:09,449
OK. With this much weight,
you're gonna fall like a brick.

1369
02:02:10,797 --> 02:02:12,085
We've still got about an hour,

1370
02:02:12,086 --> 02:02:13,973
so you should get
there in plenty of time.

1371
02:02:14,839 --> 02:02:16,746
When you get down there,
all you gotta do is...

1372
02:02:16,747 --> 02:02:18,737
...cut one wire, drop the
weights and come on home.

1373
02:02:23,019 --> 02:02:25,522
- Hand me that wrench over there will ya?
- Maybe I oughta check out everything.

1374
02:02:29,179 --> 02:02:31,152
That's loose.
I'll fix that up.

1375
02:02:32,326 --> 02:02:34,973
Bud, you don't have to do this.

1376
02:02:36,301 --> 02:02:37,456
Somebody's gotta do it.

1377
02:02:38,159 --> 02:02:39,573
Well it doesn't have to be you.

1378
02:02:40,507 --> 02:02:41,450
Who then?

1379
02:02:46,224 --> 02:02:49,871
So, what, I can hear you
but I can't talk, right?

1380
02:02:49,958 --> 02:02:52,383
The fluid prevents the larynx
from making sound. Excuse me.

1381
02:02:52,759 --> 02:02:54,732
- It'll feel a little strange.
- Yeah, no shit.

1382
02:02:55,704 --> 02:02:59,043
I gotta warn you all...
I'm a pretty lousy typist.

1383
02:03:03,249 --> 02:03:04,356
The moment of truth.

1384
02:03:06,088 --> 02:03:07,580
- Come on. Let's go.
- Let's go.

1385
02:03:09,130 --> 02:03:09,851
Easy.

1386
02:03:12,537 --> 02:03:14,462
- I need it in the front a little bit.
- OK.

1387
02:03:14,481 --> 02:03:15,953
- Thank you.
- You got it.

1388
02:03:17,888 --> 02:03:19,611
- Set.
- Set.
- Clamp?

1389
02:03:19,630 --> 02:03:20,284
Set.

1390
02:03:30,563 --> 02:03:32,074
OK, let's rock and roll!

1391
02:03:34,220 --> 02:03:34,913
Crack it.

1392
02:03:36,126 --> 02:03:37,512
- Headset...
- Headset, please.

1393
02:03:39,802 --> 02:03:42,132
- OK.
- Relax now, Bud. Just relax.

1394
02:03:43,431 --> 02:03:45,019
- Bud.
- Relax now, Bud.

1395
02:03:45,163 --> 02:03:45,885
Watch me.

1396
02:03:46,703 --> 02:03:48,628
- Relax.
- OK? Watch me. Watch me.
- OK.

1397
02:03:48,984 --> 02:03:50,842
Doin' fine. No, don't hold
your breath. Take it in.

1398
02:03:50,938 --> 02:03:53,584
Just let yourself take it in.
Take it in.

1399
02:03:55,240 --> 02:03:56,818
- That's it.
- Oh man.

1400
02:03:56,819 --> 02:03:58,397
Don't hold your breath now.
Take it in. There you go.

1401
02:03:59,215 --> 02:04:01,091
Don't hold your breath.
Take it in. That's it.

1402
02:04:01,140 --> 02:04:03,353
- There you go.
- Bud!

1403
02:04:03,979 --> 02:04:05,519
This is not normal!

1404
02:04:05,904 --> 02:04:08,550
It's normal! It'll pass in a second!
It's perfectly normal!

1405
02:04:09,166 --> 02:04:10,764
- This is normal?
- It's perfectly normal.

1406
02:04:11,775 --> 02:04:15,384
We all breathe liquid for 9 months, Bud.
Your body will remember. That's it.

1407
02:04:16,077 --> 02:04:17,068
That's it.

1408
02:04:18,175 --> 02:04:20,821
- Perfectly normal.
- Oh my, Christ! He's breathing!

1409
02:04:21,158 --> 02:04:22,121
Give me that.

1410
02:04:23,757 --> 02:04:25,970
- Can you hear me?
- There he goes.

1411
02:04:26,067 --> 02:04:27,342
- Yes? Yes?
- He's got it. That's it.

1412
02:04:27,343 --> 02:04:28,617
OK. Bud...

1413
02:04:29,387 --> 02:04:30,349
Try your keypad.

1414
02:04:45,052 --> 02:04:46,015
I already have.

1415
02:04:49,961 --> 02:04:50,731
- OK.
- Great.

1416
02:04:50,750 --> 02:04:51,404
Let's go!

1417
02:04:52,588 --> 02:04:53,329
- OK.

1418
02:04:58,478 --> 02:05:00,740
- OK, Hippy, you got that?
- Hold on, Jammer.

1419
02:05:01,750 --> 02:05:02,953
Easy. Easy.

1420
02:05:03,165 --> 02:05:05,456
Watch out. Watch his side.
Watch the back.

1421
02:05:07,092 --> 02:05:07,862
Careful.

1422
02:05:10,432 --> 02:05:14,214
I redid Little Geek's chip
the same as Big Geek!

1423
02:05:14,503 --> 02:05:16,331
It should take you straight there!

1424
02:05:16,553 --> 02:05:18,680
All you have to do is hang on!

1425
02:07:01,833 --> 02:07:02,882
What's his depth?

1426
02:07:03,133 --> 02:07:06,193
- 3,200 feet.
- Your depth is 3,200 feet.

1427
02:07:06,212 --> 02:07:09,514
You're doing fine. Now,
you better watch out for crane wreckage.

1428
02:07:09,552 --> 02:07:11,246
You should, you should
be almost to it.

1429
02:07:22,555 --> 02:07:24,239
4,800 feet. It's official.

1430
02:07:24,431 --> 02:07:25,394
Yeah.

1431
02:07:26,116 --> 02:07:29,580
Bud, according to Monk here, you just
set a record for the deepest suit dive.

1432
02:07:30,629 --> 02:07:33,199
Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this
when you got up this morning, huh?

1433
02:07:42,371 --> 02:07:44,411
1 mile down. Still grinnin'.

1434
02:08:00,301 --> 02:08:01,668
8,500 feet.

1435
02:08:04,199 --> 02:08:05,527
8,500 feet, Bud.

1436
02:08:05,575 --> 02:08:06,923
Everything OK?

1437
02:08:09,473 --> 02:08:12,649
Ask him about pressure effects.
Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.

1438
02:08:15,219 --> 02:08:16,884
Ensign Monk wants to know how you feel.

1439
02:08:28,866 --> 02:08:31,128
It's starting. It hits the nervous system first.

1440
02:08:31,638 --> 02:08:33,823
Keep talking Lindsey.
Let him hear your voice.

1441
02:08:34,314 --> 02:08:36,229
OK, Bud. Your depth is 8,900 feet.

1442
02:08:36,277 --> 02:08:39,001
- You're doing fine.
- No, Lindsey.

1443
02:08:40,030 --> 02:08:41,080
Talk to him.

1444
02:08:48,452 --> 02:08:49,414
Bud...

1445
02:08:50,713 --> 02:08:53,841
...there's some... some things I need to say.

1446
02:08:55,795 --> 02:08:57,037
It's hard for me, you know.

1447
02:08:59,260 --> 02:09:01,445
It's not easy being a cast-iron bitch.

1448
02:09:02,243 --> 02:09:04,524
It takes discipline and years of training.

1449
02:09:06,392 --> 02:09:07,989
A lot of people don't appreciate that.

1450
02:09:10,769 --> 02:09:13,253
Jesus, I'm sorry
I can't tell you these things to your face.

1451
02:09:14,600 --> 02:09:17,054
I have to wait till you're
alone in the dark...

1452
02:09:17,863 --> 02:09:20,288
...freezing, and there's 10,000
feet of water between us.

1453
02:09:22,694 --> 02:09:24,224
I'm sorry. I'm, I'm rambling.

1454
02:09:37,718 --> 02:09:39,325
Comin' up on the big ten thou'.

1455
02:09:46,938 --> 02:09:48,141
12,000 feet. Jesus!

1456
02:09:48,179 --> 02:09:49,825
- I don't believe he's doin' this!
- Hippy!

1457
02:09:50,768 --> 02:09:52,231
Shut up! What's wrong with you?

1458
02:09:56,793 --> 02:09:57,958
Bud, how are you doing?

1459
02:10:00,652 --> 02:10:01,711
Signal's fading.

1460
02:10:01,807 --> 02:10:04,502
No! No, Bud, I'm not going away.
I'm right here.

1461
02:10:04,647 --> 02:10:05,825
Kill everything we don't need.

1462
02:10:05,826 --> 02:10:08,496
Uh, Catfish, knock out those
exterior lights. Come on now. Go! Go!

1463
02:10:08,641 --> 02:10:11,384
Run it through the digital processor!
Cook it as much as you can!

1464
02:10:12,346 --> 02:10:13,838
I am right here with you, Bud.

1465
02:10:14,810 --> 02:10:15,936
Bud, this is Lindsey.

1466
02:10:16,484 --> 02:10:18,698
Please. I'm right here with you.

1467
02:10:19,516 --> 02:10:22,933
OK? So try and stay calm.
I'm right here, all right?

1468
02:10:29,266 --> 02:10:30,151
Bud.

1469
02:10:33,067 --> 02:10:33,953
He's losing it.

1470
02:10:34,357 --> 02:10:37,850
- Talk to him. Keep him with us.
- Comin' up on 16,000...

1471
02:10:37,899 --> 02:10:40,112
No, B-Bud, it's the pressure. All right?

1472
02:10:40,131 --> 02:10:42,133
You have to listen to my voice.
You have to try.

1473
02:10:42,682 --> 02:10:46,079
Concentrate, all right?
Just listen to my voice. Please.

1474
02:10:47,090 --> 02:10:48,918
17,000 feet.

1475
02:10:49,352 --> 02:10:51,132
Christ almighty, this is insane.

1476
02:10:51,921 --> 02:10:53,683
Bud? I'm not getting anything!

1477
02:10:59,746 --> 02:11:01,042
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Oh come on! No! No!

1478
02:11:01,043 --> 02:11:01,574
What? What!?

1479
02:11:01,777 --> 02:11:04,462
- Little Geek just folded.
- Oh, Jesus.

1480
02:11:53,248 --> 02:11:54,990
He can still make it.

1481
02:11:55,904 --> 02:11:56,866
OK.

1482
02:12:00,177 --> 02:12:00,822
Bud?

1483
02:12:02,099 --> 02:12:03,870
I know how alone you feel.

1484
02:12:05,977 --> 02:12:09,452
Alone in all that... cold... blackness.

1485
02:12:13,032 --> 02:12:17,199
But I'm there in the dark with you.
Oh, Bud. You're not alone.

1486
02:12:21,482 --> 02:12:22,974
Oh, God!

1487
02:12:23,571 --> 02:12:25,043
You remember that time...

1488
02:12:26,083 --> 02:12:28,364
...you were pretty drunk.
You probably don't remember.

1489
02:12:29,028 --> 02:12:31,629
But the power went out
in that little apartment

1490
02:12:31,630 --> 02:12:32,983
we had on Orange Street.

1491
02:12:33,975 --> 02:12:36,170
We were staring at
that one little candle

1492
02:12:36,171 --> 02:12:38,469
and I, I said something
really dumb like...

1493
02:12:39,220 --> 02:12:40,683
..."That candle is me," like...

1494
02:12:42,126 --> 02:12:46,505
...like everyone of us is out there
alone in the dark in this life.

1495
02:12:48,286 --> 02:12:51,017
And you just... you just
lit up another candle

1496
02:12:51,018 --> 02:12:52,761
and you put it beside mine...

1497
02:12:52,790 --> 02:12:55,841
...and you said, "No. See, 
that's me. That's me."

1498
02:12:57,439 --> 02:12:59,691
And we stared at the 
two candles and then...

1499
02:13:02,742 --> 02:13:04,323
...well, if you remember any of this,

1500
02:13:04,324 --> 02:13:05,947
I'm sure you remember the next part.

1501
02:13:10,056 --> 02:13:12,241
But there are two candles in the dark.

1502
02:13:14,320 --> 02:13:15,427
I'm with you.

1503
02:13:16,581 --> 02:13:19,517
I'll always be with you, Bud. 
I promise that.

1504
02:13:32,587 --> 02:13:33,665
How you doin' partner?

1505
02:13:35,541 --> 02:13:37,370
You still with us? Come back.

1506
02:13:38,640 --> 02:13:40,498
You talk to us, Buddy boy.

1507
02:13:40,873 --> 02:13:42,471
- Come on.
- Bud?

1508
02:13:43,145 --> 02:13:44,203
Talk to me, Bud.

1509
02:13:44,752 --> 02:13:46,465
Now, come on. 
You hangin' in there?

1510
02:13:47,331 --> 02:13:49,939
You just... you have to talk
to me, Bud! Please!

1511
02:13:50,363 --> 02:13:52,124
I need to know if you're OK.

1512
02:14:06,570 --> 02:14:08,206
You s... you see light?

1513
02:14:08,290 --> 02:14:09,589
What kind of light, Bud?

1514
02:14:11,909 --> 02:14:13,294
He's hallucinating badly.

1515
02:14:36,017 --> 02:14:39,040
- He made it.
- Oh, my God.

1516
02:14:41,532 --> 02:14:42,389
OK, Bud.

1517
02:14:42,995 --> 02:14:44,766
We'll go step by step.

1518
02:14:45,343 --> 02:14:49,001
Remove the detonator housing
by unscrewing it...

1519
02:14:49,241 --> 02:14:50,781
...counterclockwise.

1520
02:15:20,713 --> 02:15:23,263
All right, Bud. You have to cut...

1521
02:15:23,312 --> 02:15:25,766
...the ground wire. 
Not the lead wire.

1522
02:15:27,152 --> 02:15:29,327
It's the blue wire with the white stripe.

1523
02:15:29,519 --> 02:15:31,252
Not, I repeat...

1524
02:15:31,829 --> 02:15:34,813
...not the black wire 
with the yellow stripe.

1525
02:16:30,451 --> 02:16:31,741
Quiet! Quiet! Save your air.

1526
02:16:32,077 --> 02:16:34,580
Bud, give me a reading
off your liquid oxygen gauge.

1527
02:16:42,058 --> 02:16:42,837
What?

1528
02:16:44,300 --> 02:16:46,396
It took him 30 minutes
just to get down there!

1529
02:16:46,397 --> 02:16:47,380
Bud! Do you hear me?

1530
02:16:47,775 --> 02:16:49,401
You drop your weights 
and start back now Bud!

1531
02:16:50,027 --> 02:16:52,606
That gauge could be wrong. 
Do you hear me?

1532
02:16:52,885 --> 02:16:55,386
Just drop your weights
and start back now!

1533
02:16:55,387 --> 02:16:56,956
Your gauge could be wrong!

1534
02:16:57,332 --> 02:16:58,732
Your gauge could be wrong!

1535
02:16:58,733 --> 02:17:01,047
You drop your weights
and start back now!

1536
02:17:04,906 --> 02:17:07,673
No, you won't stay there.
You drop your weights.

1537
02:17:07,674 --> 02:17:09,988
You can breathe shallow!
Do you hear me?

1538
02:17:10,315 --> 02:17:12,971
Bud, please listen to me! 
Please! Goddamn it!

1539
02:17:13,106 --> 02:17:15,339
You dragged me back from 
that bottomless pit!

1540
02:17:15,387 --> 02:17:18,313
You can't leave me here 
alone now. Please!

1541
02:17:19,054 --> 02:17:21,354
Oh, God, Virgil! Please!

1542
02:17:21,614 --> 02:17:22,942
Please!

1543
02:18:02,187 --> 02:18:03,621
I love you.

1544
02:22:57,307 --> 02:22:58,222
Howdy.

1545
02:22:59,107 --> 02:22:59,993
Uh...

1546
02:23:00,965 --> 02:23:02,120
...how are you guys doin'?

1547
02:23:07,836 --> 02:23:11,215
Attempts to convene a summit
between heads of state have collapsed...

1548
02:23:11,619 --> 02:23:14,391
The Soviet build-up of 
tanks and aircraft has...

1549
02:23:14,824 --> 02:23:19,155
All citizens to stay on their jobs, 
restrict unnecessary travel...

1550
02:23:19,472 --> 02:23:20,969
...just moments ago is
what officials are calling

1551
02:23:20,970 --> 02:23:21,628
an unprovoked attack.

1552
02:23:21,705 --> 02:23:22,793
Oh, shit!

1553
02:23:22,812 --> 02:23:23,684
Across the country,

1554
02:23:23,685 --> 02:23:25,795
National Guard units
have been mobilized...

1555
02:23:25,911 --> 02:23:29,549
...and all civil defense volunteers
have been called to full-time duty.

1556
02:23:32,484 --> 02:23:35,131
You watch our TV.
That's what you're telling me.

1557
02:23:35,709 --> 02:23:37,568
That you know what's
going on up there?

1558
02:23:37,569 --> 02:23:39,029
Seismologists are reporting...

1559
02:23:39,077 --> 02:23:41,772
...an enormous disturbance 
throughout the world's oceans...

1560
02:23:41,791 --> 02:23:44,534
...which apparently began 
about fifteen minutes ago.

1561
02:23:44,563 --> 02:23:47,024
They are acoustic shock
waves like tsunamis,

1562
02:23:47,025 --> 02:23:49,375
but with no apparent
seismological source.

1563
02:23:49,423 --> 02:23:52,599
Uh, the waves are propagating towards
the shorelines of every continent.

1564
02:23:53,225 --> 02:23:55,515
- I'm so sorry. That's...
- Dr. Berg, would you please...

1565
02:23:55,535 --> 02:23:57,546
Young lady. Young lady, 
listen to me.

1566
02:23:57,931 --> 02:23:59,641
I don't know. We don't
know what's going on yet.

1567
02:23:59,642 --> 02:24:00,443
We don't have a clue.

1568
02:24:03,042 --> 02:24:04,784
The horizon has already grown dark.

1569
02:24:05,015 --> 02:24:07,613
People are running everywhere.
It's, it's sheer panic.

1570
02:24:08,191 --> 02:24:09,201
Stay on me!

1571
02:24:09,365 --> 02:24:11,055
Uh, the wave... 
the wave is...

1572
02:24:11,056 --> 02:24:13,484
I don't know, maybe
1,000 feet high already.

1573
02:24:13,850 --> 02:24:15,120
Getting bigger as I'm watching...

1574
02:24:15,216 --> 02:24:16,564
...still miles out.

1575
02:24:18,017 --> 02:24:19,615
- Oh my God.
- Get outta here!

1576
02:24:19,644 --> 02:24:20,895
We're staying! We're staying!

1577
02:24:21,713 --> 02:24:22,772
Give it to me, then!

1578
02:24:23,253 --> 02:24:25,611
Uh, I don't even know if
I'm still broadcasting.

1579
02:24:25,612 --> 02:24:26,429
I can't be sure.

1580
02:24:26,621 --> 02:24:30,038
- I'll just keep going as long as I can. Um...
- Get out of the way!

1581
02:24:33,493 --> 02:24:35,062
You guys are doing this.

1582
02:24:37,497 --> 02:24:40,047
You guys are doing this, right?
You can control water.

1583
02:24:41,154 --> 02:24:43,685
That's your technology,
but why are you doing this?

1584
02:25:03,483 --> 02:25:05,263
OK. That's enough. I get the point!

1585
02:25:07,698 --> 02:25:09,642
How do you know...

1586
02:25:09,661 --> 02:25:11,038
...they're really gonna do it?

1587
02:25:13,107 --> 02:25:16,812
Where do you get off passing judgment
on us? You can't be sure.

1588
02:25:17,534 --> 02:25:18,833
How do you know?

1589
02:28:06,163 --> 02:28:07,482
You could've done it.

1590
02:28:11,736 --> 02:28:12,919
Why didn't you?

1591
02:29:28,692 --> 02:29:31,637
Deepcore, do you read?
This is Benthic Explorer. Over.

1592
02:29:31,974 --> 02:29:33,071
Do you hear, Deepcore?

1593
02:29:34,399 --> 02:29:37,113
Deepcore, do you read?
Do you read me, Deepcore?

1594
02:29:39,750 --> 02:29:42,580
Deepcore, do you read?
This is Benthic Explorer. Over.

1595
02:29:45,457 --> 02:29:47,411
Hell, yes, we read! 
Good of you to join us!

1596
02:29:47,604 --> 02:29:49,240
Copy, Deepcore. 
Hey, I've got 'em!

1597
02:29:50,260 --> 02:29:51,781
How's that storm goin' up there?

1598
02:29:52,031 --> 02:29:52,744
Well, it's strange,

1599
02:29:52,745 --> 02:29:54,658
It just sort of blew
itself out all of a sudden.

1600
02:29:55,072 --> 02:29:57,180
Well, hell, son.
You'd better get a line down to us.

1601
02:29:57,228 --> 02:29:59,752
We're in moderately
poor shape down here.

1602
02:29:59,753 --> 02:30:01,915
We've lost 7 people, including Bud.

1603
02:30:02,165 --> 02:30:03,438
And we're about out of O2

1604
02:30:03,439 --> 02:30:06,034
So, whatever you're gonna
do, you better do it fast.

1605
02:30:07,719 --> 02:30:09,836
You boys make up your mind
how to get us outta here yet?

1606
02:30:10,269 --> 02:30:12,810
They're talking about
flying in a DSRV from Norfolk.

1607
02:30:12,916 --> 02:30:14,937
- I just wish I could've seen it.
- OK.

1608
02:30:15,485 --> 02:30:16,958
How long's that gonna take?

1609
02:30:17,006 --> 02:30:20,104
How do you stop a half
mile high tidal wave in?

1610
02:30:20,105 --> 02:30:21,963
- ...come into Guantanamo on a C133.

1611
02:30:24,571 --> 02:30:25,293
Hey...

1612
02:30:26,014 --> 02:30:30,047
- Hey... hey it's Bud!
- That's impossible.

1613
02:30:31,394 --> 02:30:33,319
- Do you read me Deepcore?
- No it's not.

1614
02:30:34,311 --> 02:30:35,244
Yes!

1615
02:30:36,486 --> 02:30:38,950
W-W-Wait. Wait. Wait.
We've got a message from Bud.

1616
02:30:39,046 --> 02:30:41,356
- Bud?
- What's it say?

1617
02:30:42,780 --> 02:30:43,665
Here. Here.

1618
02:30:45,879 --> 02:30:46,957
It says...

1619
02:30:47,900 --> 02:30:51,028
It says, uh, Virgil Brigman
back on the air.

1620
02:31:03,809 --> 02:31:06,427
Have some new friends down here.

1621
02:31:07,072 --> 02:31:08,843
Guess they've been here a while.

1622
02:31:18,294 --> 02:31:20,434
They've left us alone,
but it bothers them

1623
02:31:20,435 --> 02:31:21,941
to see us hurting each other.

1624
02:31:26,167 --> 02:31:27,350
Getting out of hand.

1625
02:31:35,887 --> 02:31:38,264
They sent a message. 
Hope you got it.

1626
02:31:38,986 --> 02:31:41,267
I'd say that's a big 10-4, Jack.

1627
02:31:43,048 --> 02:31:44,511
They want us to grow up a bit...

1628
02:31:44,732 --> 02:31:46,888
...and, put away childish things.

1629
02:31:48,986 --> 02:31:52,046
Of course, it's just a suggestion.

1630
02:32:00,092 --> 02:32:02,248
Looks like you boys
might be out of business.

1631
02:32:12,546 --> 02:32:14,375
What the hell's goin' on?

1632
02:32:14,664 --> 02:32:16,396
One Night, get to sonar.

1633
02:32:16,829 --> 02:32:18,128
Good God almighty!

1634
02:32:20,072 --> 02:32:23,470
Fellas... I'm gettin' some 
awful big readings here.

1635
02:32:23,566 --> 02:32:25,683
- Somebody's comin' up the wall!
- What is it?

1636
02:32:25,703 --> 02:32:27,416
Whatever it is, it's major!

1637
02:32:57,515 --> 02:32:59,921
Something is definitely
going on down there.

1638
02:33:01,317 --> 02:33:03,841
Active is pinging back
something really big.

1639
02:33:03,842 --> 02:33:06,572
It's huge and it's comin'
up right underneath us.

1640
02:33:06,573 --> 02:33:07,063
Where?

1641
02:33:07,091 --> 02:33:10,652
Where!? It's everywhere! 
There! Starboard bow!

1642
02:34:30,342 --> 02:34:32,883
There! Look! Look!

1643
02:34:44,423 --> 02:34:45,645
Help, Cat!

1644
02:35:15,538 --> 02:35:18,801
We should be dead. 
We didn't decompress.

1645
02:35:21,332 --> 02:35:23,719
They must have done
something to us.

1646
02:35:25,317 --> 02:35:26,144
Oh, yeah.

1647
02:35:27,665 --> 02:35:29,465
Yeah, I think you could say that.

1648
02:36:17,452 --> 02:36:18,424
Hi, Brigman.

1649
02:36:20,493 --> 02:36:21,792
Hi, Mrs. Brigman.
