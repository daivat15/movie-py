The fluorescence in the washing
powder is caught by the UV light.

- Why do you know that?

00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,416
to the entire universe.

329
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:01,095
If Einstein is right,
or if general relativity is correct,

330
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,264
then the universe is expanding, yes?

331
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:04,765
- Yes.
- Okay.

332
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:08,269
So, if you reverse time,
then the universe is getting smaller.

333
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,354
All right.

334
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:14,608
So, what if I reverse the process
all the way back,

335
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,778
to see what happened
at the beginning of time itself?

336
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,989
- At the beginning of time itself?
- Yes.

337
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,992

It's called motor neuron disease.

367
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,036
It's a progressive neurological disorder

368
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:55,871
that destroys the cells in the brain

373
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:11,588
The signals that muscles must receive
in order to move are disrupted.

374
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,850
The result is gradual muscle decay.

So, Stephen, in summary, um,

522
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:32,243
as we know, chapter one,
full of holes, uh,

523
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:35,746
lacks mathematical support.

00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:39,622
- Professor Thorne?
- Chapter two, not really original.

525
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,585

we have chapter four.

01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,167
I used to love singing.

823
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,086
You're very good at it.

824
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:54,172
I don't know about that.

825
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:55,673
Just go.

826
01:00:58,405 --> 01:01:00,052
It's one hour a week.

827
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:02,183
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm.

829
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:44,969
Really lovely, everyone.

830
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:47,145
Okay. See you next week.

831
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:52,817
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

832
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,438
Goodbye.

833
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:00,742
- Hello.
- Hello.

834
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:02,577
Have you come to sing?

835
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:04,120
Um...

836
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:06,536
I just came to, um...

837
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,577
(CHUCKLING) Soprano?

838
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:12,379
- Mezzo.
- Ah!

839
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,131
Lovely, just what we need.

840
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:15,583
Where have you been hiding?

841
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,384
Good question.

842
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:20,258
Well, you're here now,
and, uh, just in time,

843
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:22,506
as they say.

844
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:30,147
- Oh, uh, you know, I have to
come back anyway, so...
- Good.

845
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:32,475
- You have everything?
- Yes, thank you. Yes.

846
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:34,151
Thank you for coming.

847
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:36,945
You will be a valuable asset.

848
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,613
- Thank you. (CHUCKLING)

Um...

850
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:43,952
Well, I should be going.

851
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:46,746
Um, and if your son wants
those piano lessons, just...

852
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:49,708
- Yes, yes, absolutely. I, um...
- Call me.

853
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:50,917
- I will do.
- Great.

854
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:53,753
My husband adores music, too.

855
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:56,923
Oh, well, I could... Does he play?

856
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,341
Um...

857
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,589
I could teach him, as well. Um...

858
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:03,346
That's a long story.

859
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,803
- But, um...
- Ah, okay.

860
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:08,476
- Well, thank you, Jonathan.
- My pleasure, Jane. See you again.

861
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:10,053
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

Third finger. No, that...
That one, there.

01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:39,416
Try lifting your wrists a little bit.
Keep your elbows back.

ROBERT: No.

867
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:56,684
- (CHUCKLING) Good.
- (CHUCKLING) Yeah.

868
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:04,650
JANE: More wine?

869
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,410
Um, why not? Thank you.

870
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,783
- Stephen?
- No.

(JONATHAN CLEARING THROAT)

872
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:31,718
Stephen, Jane was telling me that
you have a beautiful, uh, theorem.

873
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:35,389
Um...

874
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:38,483
That proves that the universe, um,

875
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,560
had a beginning. Is that it?

876
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:46,946
That was my PhD thesis.

877
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:53,536
My new project disproves it.

878
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:56,876
- Uh, disproves it? Oh.
- Yes.

879
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:01,832
Um, so then you no longer
believe in the creation?

880
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:08,385
What one believes
is irrelevant in physics.

881
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:10,344
"Irrelevant in physics."

882
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:12,430
Oh. (CLEARING THROAT)

883
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:14,268
I see.

884
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:16,604
Stephen's done a U-turn.

885
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:20,308
The big new idea is that the universe
has no boundaries at all.

886
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:23,028
No boundaries, no beginning.

887
01:05:23,128 --> 01:05:25,230
And no God. Oh.

888
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:29,284
Oh, I see. I... (CHUCKLES)
I thought that, um,

889
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:33,489
you'd proved the universe had a beginning
and thus a need for a creator.

890
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:36,116
(CHUCKLES) My mistake.

891
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:39,252
No, mine.

892
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:43,882
Stephen is looking for a single theory

893
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:46,631
that explains all the forces
in the universe.

894
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:49,675
Therefore, God must die.

895
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,257
Oh, uh, why must God die? I don't see.

896
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:55,886
The two great pillars of physics

897
01:05:56,244 --> 01:05:58,563
are quantum theory,

898
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:02,976
the laws that govern the very
small particles, electrons and so on,

899
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:05,983
and general relativity.

900
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,780
Ah, yes, Einstein.

901
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:09,240
Einstein's theory, the laws that govern

902
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,117
the very large planets and such.

903
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:14,287
But quantum and relativity...

904
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,489
Don't tell me. They're different?

905
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:19,659
They don't remotely
play by the same rules.

906
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:24,089
If the world were
all potatoes, then, easy.

907
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:26,883
You could trace a precise beginning

908
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,835
as Stephen once did.

909
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:31,178
A moment of creation.

910
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:34,640
Hallelujah. God lives.

911
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:36,768
If you incorporate peas into the menu,

912
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:38,515
well, then it all goes a little...

913
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:40,939
- Tits up.
- Oh. (CHUCKLING)

914
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,108
Yes. Haywire.

915
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:45,527
- It just all becomes a godless mess.
- Oh, dear.

916
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:48,188
- (CHUCKLING)
- Einstein hated peas.

917
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:53,611
Quantum theory. He said,
"God doesn't play dice with the universe."

918
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:57,535
STEPHEN: Seems he not only plays dice,

919
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:03,040
but he throws them
where we can't find them.

920
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:06,756
- God is back on the endangered species list.

Physics is back in business.

925
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:32,653
I was, uh, married, actually.

926
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:36,660
Um... But, sadly, she passed.

927
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,498
Almost a year ago now.

(EXHALING)

929
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:44,915
It was, uh, leukemia.

930
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:50,166
Um, she fought it and I nursed her.

931
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:53,428
But, uh, in the end...

932
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:55,255
Um... (SIGHING)

933
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:00,727
I do get quite lonely.

934

The, uh, (INHALING DEEPLY)
tyranny of the empty room

935
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:06,607
and all that.

936
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:11,529
But music is my salvation.
Teaching and playing.

937
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:14,616
Not really as a career,
but I'm not very ambitious.

938
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:16,534
Though that's not...

(SIGHING)

940
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,913
Is that a sin? I don't know.

941
01:08:26,728 --> 01:08:29,331
Wrong man to ask.

942
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:36,971
Thank you so much for having me.

01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:39,924
- Thank you for coming.
- It was really, really wonderful.

01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,269
If there's anything
I can do to be of service,

945
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:44,395
um, to you,

946
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,814
to the family, I mean, I would

947
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:48,732
consider it a privilege.

948
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,400
I have no children or commitments, so...

949
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:56,650
I only mean that if I could be of help,

950
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,035
I believe I might find
a purpose that would

951
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,909
help alleviate my own,

if you need help.

I've always been supportive
of your choice not to have home help,

but we need to find
a permanent solution.

You need to have a proper

01:48:55,779 --> 01:48:59,383
I was stopped recently
by a tourist in Cambridge,

1317
01:48:59,658 --> 01:49:02,386
who asked if I was
the real Stephen Hawking.

1318
01:49:03,454 --> 01:49:07,900
I replied I was not and said the
real one was much better looking.

1319
01:49:11,211 --> 01:49:14,281
In 1979, you talked
about the possibility

1320
01:49:14,381 --> 01:49:17,985
of a theory of everything being
discovered before the end of the century.

1321
01:49:19,636 --> 01:49:22,114
I now predict that I was wrong.

1322
01:49:26,977 --> 01:49:28,045
Professor Hawking,

1323
01:49:28,145 --> 01:49:30,839
you have said you do not believe in God.

1324
01:49:32,733 --> 01:49:35,677
Do you have a philosophy of life
that helps you? (FADES OFF)

1325
01:50:38,757 --> 01:50:41,235
You have said you do not believe in God.

1326
01:50:43,262 --> 01:50:45,740
Do you have a philosophy
of life that helps you?

1327
01:51:09,121 --> 01:51:12,976
It is clear that we are just
an advanced breed of primates

1328
01:51:13,125 --> 01:51:17,355
on a minor planet orbiting
around a very average star

1329
01:51:17,546 --> 01:51:22,368
in the outer suburb of one
among 100 billion galaxies.

1330
01:51:24,094 --> 01:51:25,195
But,

1331
01:51:25,762 --> 01:51:28,285
ever since the dawn of civilization,

1332
01:51:28,599 --> 01:51:31,043
people have craved for an understanding

1333
01:51:31,143 --> 01:51:33,496
of the underlying order of the world.

1334
01:51:35,189 --> 01:51:37,841
There ought to be something very special

1335
01:51:37,941 --> 01:51:41,170
about the boundary conditions
of the universe.

1336
01:51:42,237 --> 01:51:46,058
And what can be more special
than that there is no boundary...

1337
01:51:48,785 --> 01:51:52,264
And there should be no boundary
to human endeavor.

1338
01:51:54,333 --> 01:51:56,026
We are all different.

1339
01:51:56,793 --> 01:51:58,861
However bad life may seem,

1340
01:51:59,046 --> 01:52:02,571
there is always something
you can do and succeed at.

1341
01:52:04,092 --> 01:52:07,162
While there is life, there is hope.

1342
01:52:07,471 --> 01:52:09,118
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

1343
01:52:28,367 --> 01:52:29,468
That came.

1344
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:41,146
It's from Stephen.

1345
01:52:48,303 --> 01:52:49,404
Gosh.

1346
01:53:09,199 --> 01:53:11,643
Your glasses are always dirty.

1347
01:53:29,469 --> 01:53:32,698
EQUERRY: Professor and Mrs. Hawking,
Her Majesty the Queen.

1348
01:54:03,337 --> 01:54:04,859
Congratulations...

1349
01:54:06,590 --> 01:54:09,159
My Companion of Honour.

1350
01:54:11,219 --> 01:54:13,538
Not bad for an old liberal socialist.

1351
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:18,459
(WHISPERS) Don't worry,
you can decline the knighthood.

1352
01:54:29,237 --> 01:54:31,260
Thank you, for today.

1353
01:54:32,616 --> 01:54:33,933
It was extraordinary.

1354
01:54:35,535 --> 01:54:38,229
It's all been rather
extraordinary though, hasn't it?

1355
01:54:43,001 --> 01:54:44,478
(CLICKING)

1356
01:54:47,172 --> 01:54:48,524
What are you writing?

1357
01:55:00,811 --> 01:55:04,085
Look what we made.
