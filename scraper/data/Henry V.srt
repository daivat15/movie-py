1
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,518
Oh, for a muse of fire...

2
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:27,940
that would ascend the
brightest heaven of invention.

3
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,506
A kingdom for a stage,

4
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,259
princes to act...

5
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:59,513
and monarchs to behold
the swelling scene.

6
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,851
Then should the warlike harry,
like himself,

7
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,894
assume the port of Mars...

8
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:09,565
and at his heels,
leashed in like hounds,

9
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,986
should famine, sword and fire
crouch for employment.

10
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,990
But pardon, gentles all,

11
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,951
the flat, unraised spirits...

12
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,829
that have dared
on this unworthy scaffold...

13
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,124
to bring forth
so great an object.

14
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:32,087
Can this cockpit hold
the vasty fields of France

15
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,924
or may we cram
within this wooden "o"...

16
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,845
the very casques that did affright
the air at Agincourt?

17
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,389
Oh, pardon.

18
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,559
Let us, ciphers
to this great account,

19
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:48,187
on your imaginary forces work.

20
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,939
For it is your thoughts
that now must deck our kings,

21
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:54,526
carry them here, there,
jumping o'er times,

22
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:58,989
turning the accomplishment of
many years into an hourglass.

23
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:04,369
For the which supply,
admit me, chorus, to this history,

24
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,664
who, prologue-like,

25
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,584
your humble patience pray...

26
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,212
gently to hear,

27
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,048
kindly to judge...

28
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,509
our play!

29
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,145
My lord, I'll tell you.

30
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,696
That self bill is urged,
which, in the 11th year...

31
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,324
of the last king's reign was
like to have passed against us.

32
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,077
But how, my lord,
shall we resist it now?

33
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,079
It must be thought on.

34
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,998
If it pass against us, we lose the
better half of our possession.

35
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,125
But what prevention?

36
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,837
The king is full of grace
and fair regard.

37
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,714
And a true lover
of the holy church.

38
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,925
The courses of his youth
promised it not.

39
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:02,261
Since his addiction
was to courses vain,

40
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,848
his hours filled up
with riots, banquets,

41
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:09,476
sports and never noted
in him any study.

42
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:12,521
But, my good lord,
how now for the mitigation...

43
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,857
Of this bill
urged by the commons?

44
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,276
Doth his majesty incline
to it or no?

45
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,445
He seems...
indifferent,

46
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:24,283
or rather swaying more
upon our part.

47
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:28,120
For I have made an offer
to his majesty,

48
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,622
as touching France.

49
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,250
[Footsteps approaching]

50
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:31,016
Where is my gracious
lord of Canterbury?

51
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:53,789
God and his angels guard your sacred
throne and make you long become it.

52
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,541
Sure we thank you.

53
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,043
My learned lord,
we pray you to proceed...

54
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,838
and justly and religiously unfold...

55
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,924
why the law salique
that they have in France,

56
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:07,803
or should or should not
bar us in our claim.

57
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:13,016
And pray, take heed
how you impawn our person,

58
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:17,062
how you awake
our sleeping sword of war.

59
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,774
We charge you,
in the name of God, take heed.

60
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:26,071
For never two such kingdoms did
contend without much fall of blood.

61
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,785
Then hear me,
gracious sovereign.

62
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:37,332
There is no bar to make against
your highness' claim to France...

63
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:40,794
but this, which they
produce from Pharamond.

64
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:46,884
"In terram salicam
mulieres ne succedant."

65
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:52,431
"No woman shall succeed
in Salique land."

66
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:57,769
Which Salique land
the French unjustly gloze...

67
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,771
to be the realm of France.

68
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:03,609
Yet their own authors
faithfully affirm...

69
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,445
that the land Salique
lies in Germany...

70
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,073
between the floods
of Sala and of Elbe.

71
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,410
Then doth it well appear
the Salique law...

72
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,039
was not devised
for the realm of France,

73
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:19,625
nor did the French possess
the Salique land...

74
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:24,630
until 421 years after
defunction of king Pharamond,

75
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:29,426
idly supposed
the founder of this law.

76
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:35,474
King Pepin,
which deposed childeric,

77
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:39,144
did, as heir general,
being descended of blithild,

78
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,396
which was the daughter
to king Clothair,

79
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,565
make claim and title
to the crown of France.

80
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:47,945
Hugh Capet, also, who usurped the
crown of Charles, the duke of Lorraine,

81
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:51,657
sole heir male of the true line
and stock of Charles the great,

82
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,660
could not keep quiet in his conscience
wearing the crown of France...

83
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:57,996
until satisfied that fair queen
Isabel, his grandmother,

84
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,999
was lineal
of the Lady Ermengare,

85
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,545
daughter to Charles,
the aforesaid duke of Lorraine,

86
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,339
by the which marriage the line
of Charles the great...

87
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:11,009
was reunited
to the crown of France.

88
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,101
So it is clear
as is the summer sun.

89
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,353
[Men chuckling]

90
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:25,524
All appear to hold in right
and title of the female.

91
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:29,903
So do the kings of France...

92
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,281
unto this day.

93
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,955
Howbeit, they would hold up
this salique law...

94
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:45,002
to bar your highness
claiming from the female.

95
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:50,883
May I, with right
and conscience,

96
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,719
make this claim?

97
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,391
The sin upon my head,
dread sovereign.

98
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:08,025
Stand for your own.
Unwind your bloody flag.

99
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,402
Your brother kings
and monarchs of the earth...

100
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,696
do all expect that you
should rouse yourself...

101
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,407
as did the former lions
of your blood.

102
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:19,870
Never king of England had nobles
richer and more loyal subjects...

103
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,955
whose hearts have left
their bodies here in England...

104
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,208
and lie pavilioned
in the fields of France.

105
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,710
Oh, let their bodies follow,
my dear liege,

106
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:30,881
with blood and sword and fire
to win your right.

107
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,509
In aid whereof,

108
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:38,764
we of the spirituality
will raise your highness...

109
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,767
such a mighty sum
as never did the clergy...

110
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,728
at one time bring in to
any of your ancestors.

111
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,860
Call in the messengers
sent from the Dauphin.

112
00:10:57,616 --> 00:11:01,411
Now are we well resolved,
and by God's help and yours,

113
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,041
the noble sinews of our power,
France being ours,

114
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,502
we'll bend it to our all...

115
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,925
or break it all to pieces.

116
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:29,773
Now are we well prepared to know the
pleasure of our fair cousin Dauphin.

117
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:34,152
Your highness, lately sending into France
did claim some certain dukedoms...

118
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,488
in the right of your great
predecessor, king Edward III.

119
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:40,117
In answer of which claim,
the prince, my master,

120
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:42,619
says that you savor
too much of your youth.

121
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:47,791
He therefore sends you, meeter for
your spirit, this tun of treasure.

122
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,671
And in lieu of this, desires
you let those dukedoms...

123
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,548
that you claim
hear no more of you.

124
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,259
This the Dauphin speaks.

125
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:03,015
What... treasure, uncle?

126
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:12,524
Tennis balls, my liege.

127
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:23,911
We are glad the Dauphin
is so pleasant with us.

128
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:29,708
His present and your pains
we thank you for.

129
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:34,755
When we have matched
our rackets to these balls,

130
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:38,050
we will in France,
by God's grace,

131
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:43,096
play a set shall strike his
father's crown into the hazard.

132
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,516
And we understand him well,

133
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:48,268
how he comes o'er us
with our wilder days,

134
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,938
not measuring what use
we made of them.

135
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:55,817
But tell the Dauphin
I will keep my state,

136
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:59,238
be like a king and show
my sail of greatness...

137
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:02,741
when I do rouse me
in my throne of France.

138
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:06,662
And tell the pleasant prince
this mock of his...

139
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,622
hath turned his balls
to gunstones,

140
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,542
and his soul
shall stand sore charged...

141
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,919
for the wasteful vengeance
that shall fly with them.

142
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:17,047
For many a thousand widows
shall this his mock,

143
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,007
mock out of
their dear husbands,

144
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,469
mock mothers from their sons,
mock castles down.

145
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:25,097
And some are yet ungotten
and unborn...

146
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,724
that shall have cause
to curse the Dauphin's scorn.

147
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:31,603
So get you hence in peace,

148
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:34,273
and tell the Dauphin...

149
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:40,028
his jest... will savor
but of shallow wit...

150
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:44,324
when thousands weep
more than did laugh at it.

151
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,496
Convey them with safe conduct.

152
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,959
Fare you well.

153
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:11,018
This was a merry message.
[Scoffs]

154
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:14,855
We hope to make the sender
blush at it.

155
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:20,527
Therefore, my lords,
omit no happy hour...

156
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,613
that may give furtherance
to our expedition.

157
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:25,949
For we have now no thought
in us but France,

158
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:29,328
save those to God
that run before our business.

159
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:32,956
Therefore, let every man
now task his thought...

160
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:37,711
that this fair action
may on foot be brought.

161
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,849
[Chorus] Now all the youth of
England are on fire...

162
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:54,686
and silken dalliance
in the wardrobe lies.

163
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,607
For now sits expectation
in the air...

164
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:02,236
and hides a sword,
from hilts unto the point,

165
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:06,740
with crowns imperial,
crowns and coronets...

166
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:10,452
promised to Harry and his followers.

167
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:18,836
[Meows]

168
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:28,053
Well met, Corporal Nym.

169
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:31,056
Good morrow,
Lieutenant Bardolph.

170
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:33,642
[Cat meows]
[Sniffs]

171
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:36,937
[Meows, paws running]

172
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:41,775
What, are you and Ancient Pistol friends yet?

173
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,903
For my part, I care not.

174
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,698
I say little,

175
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:52,578
but when time shall serve,
there shall be smiles.

176
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,124
But that shall be as it may.

177
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:01,003
Come, I will bestow a breakfast
to make you friends,

178
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,797
and we'll be all three
sworn brothers to France.

179
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:07,092
- Let it be so, good corporal.
- I will do as I may.

180
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,472
It is certain, corporal, that Ancient
Pistol is married to Nell quickly.

181
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,560
For certainly she did you wrong,
for you were betrothed to her.

182
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:21,732
- [Clattering]
- [Man, woman shouting, laughing]

183
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,279
How now,
mine host Pistol?

184
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,156
Base tyke!

185
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,284
Callest thou me host?

186
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:35,287
Now, by this hand,
I swear I scorn the term!

187
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:38,624
Nor shall my Nell
keep lodgers!

188
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,417
No, by my troth,
not long.

189
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:44,171
For we can't lodge or board
a dozen or 14 gentlewomen...

190
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:46,632
who live honestly
by the prick of their needles,

191
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,635
but it shall be thought
we keep a bawdy house straight.

192
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:53,138
- Pish!
- Pish for thee, Iceland dog!

193
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,099
Good Corporal Nym,

194
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,269
show thy valor
and put up thy sword.

195
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:01,438
- Will you shog off?
- [Shouts]

196
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:06,026
Pistol, I will prick your guts
a little in good terms, as I may.

197
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,986
That's the humor of it.
[Groaning]

198
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:11,532
- Braggart vile!
- Ahh, hear me when I say,

199
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:13,700
he that strikes
the first stroke,

200
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,911
I'll run him up to the hilts,
as I'm a soldier.

201
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:18,330
An oath of mickle might,

202
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:22,626
and fury shall abate.
[Footsteps approaching]

203
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:23,877
My host Pistol!

204
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:26,380
You must come to my master,
and you, hostess!

205
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:28,465
He's very sick
and would to bed.

206
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:32,970
Good Bardolph, put thy face between his
sheets and do the office of a warming pan.

207
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,222
- Away, you rogue.
- [Sighs]

208
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,976
Faith, he's very ill.

209
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,189
By my troth,

210
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:46,942
the king has killed his heart.

211
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,361
Good husband,
come home presently.

212
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:02,791
[Sighs]

213
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:07,171
Come, shall I make you two friends?
We must to France together.

214
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:10,215
Why the devil should we keep
nives to cut one another's throats?

215
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:15,179
You'll pay me the eight shillings
I won of you at betting?

216
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:18,682
Base is the slave that pays.

217
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:22,019
By this sword,
he that makes the first thrust,

218
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,937
I'll kill him,
by this sword, I will.

219
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:27,900
If ever you come of women,
come in quickly to Sir John.

220
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:31,945
He is so shaked with
a burning quotidian fever...

221
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:34,698
that it is most lamentable
to behold.

222
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:37,868
Sweet men, come to him.

223
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,915
Poor Sir John.
[Crying]

224
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,667
A good portly man of faith.

225
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:50,339
[Men chattering, laughing]
## [Medieval]

226
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,260
[Man] Aye, to a cheerful look,
a pleasing eye...

227
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:58,430
and a most noble carriage.
[Laughing continues]

228
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,358
But do I not dwindle?
[Laughing continues]

229
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:12,903
My skin hangs about me
like an old lady's loose gown.

230
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:19,826
Company, villainous company
have been the spoil of me.

231
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,621
[Shouts, laughs]

232
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:26,291
Whoo!
Hey! Hey!

233
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:30,796
I was as virtuous
as a gentleman need to be. [snickers]

234
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:34,842
Virtuous enough.
Swore a little.

235
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,511
- [Murmuring in protest]
- [Clears throat]

236
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,639
Diced not above
seven days a week.

237
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:46,228
Went to a bawdy house
not above once in the quarter.

238
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,480
- Ohhh!
- [Shouting]

239
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:53,485
Paid money that I borrowed,

240
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:56,113
three or four times.

241
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,033
Lived well
and in good compass.

242
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:03,579
What? You were so fat,
Sir John,

243
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:07,624
that you must indeed
be out of all compass.

244
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,420
Do thou amend thy face,
and I'll amend my life.

245
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,380
[Men laughing]

246
00:20:15,174 --> 00:20:16,675
[Sir John, Nell laughing]

247
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:19,511
[Exclaims, laughs]
[Laughing]

248
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:27,561
[Panting]

249
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:31,064
If sack and sugar be a fault,
then God help the wicked.

250
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:35,194
Mmm? If to be old
and merry is a sin,

251
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:38,488
if to be fat
is to be hated,

252
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:43,744
then no, my good lord,
when thou art king,

253
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:49,958
banish Pistol, banish Bardolph,
banish Nym.

254
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:54,671
But sweet Jack Falstaff,

255
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:57,216
Aliant Jack Falstaff,

256
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:00,636
and therefore more valiant
being as he is,

257
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:03,639
old Jack falstaff,

258
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:06,934
banish not him
thy Harry's company.

259
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:11,647
Banish plump Jack,
and banish all the world.

260
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,529
[Harry's voice]
I do. I will.

261
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:27,746
[Whispering] but we have heard the
chimes at midnight, master Harry.

262
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,669
[Whispers]
Jesus.

263
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:37,798
The days that we have seen.

264
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:43,470
[Harry's voice]
I know thee not, old man.

265
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:59,027
[Hoofbeats passing]

266
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,697
[Dog barking]

267
00:22:05,868 --> 00:22:08,287
The king hath run
bad humors on the knight.

268
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:12,916
Nym, thou hast
spoke the right.

269
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:17,796
His heart is fracted
and... corroborate.

270
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:21,925
The king's a good king,

271
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:24,803
but it must be as it may.

272
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,307
He passes some humors
and careers.

273
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:31,685
Let us condole the knight,

274
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:36,690
for, lambkins,
we will live.

275
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,870
The French, advised
by good intelligence...

276
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:52,206
of this most dreadful
preparation,

277
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:53,749
shake in their fear...

278
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:57,920
and with pale policy seek
to divert the English purposes.

279
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:03,091
Oh, England, model
to thy inward greatness.

280
00:23:04,176 --> 00:23:06,094
Like a little body
with a mighty heart.

281
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:09,056
What mightst thou do
that honor would thee do...

282
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:11,892
were all thy children
kind and natural?

283
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:16,605
But see, thy fault France
hath in thee found out.

284
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:21,235
A nest of hollow bosoms which he
fills with treacherous crowns...

285
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:23,362
and three corrupted men.

286
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:25,781
One, Richard Earl of Cambridge,

287
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:28,534
and the second,
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham,

288
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,995
and the third, Sir Thomas Grey, knight,
of Northumberland,

289
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:35,249
have for the gilt of France...
oh, guilt indeed...

290
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:38,502
confirmed conspiracy
with fearful France,

291
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:42,756
and by their hands
this grace of kings must die,

292
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:44,675
ere he take ship for France.

293
00:23:45,092 --> 00:23:46,635
The traitors are agreed.

294
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:48,804
The king is set from London,

295
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:52,558
and the scene
is now transported, gentles,

296
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,768
to Southhampton.

297
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:10,617
Before God, his grace is bold
to trust these traitors.

298
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:12,536
They shall be apprehended
by and by.

299
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:15,289
How smooth and even
they do bear themselves,

300
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:19,293
as if allegiance in their bosoms sat
crowned with faith and constant loyalty.

301
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:23,797
The king hath note of all they intend by
interception which they dream not of.

302
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:25,883
Nay, but the man
that was his bedfellow,

303
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:28,760
whom he hath dulled and cloyed
with gracious favors...

304
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:31,930
That he should,
for a foreign purse,

305
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:36,101
so sell his sovereign's life
to death and treachery. [clatter]

306
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:46,111
Now sits the wind fair,
and we will aboard. [chuckles]

307
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:55,996
My lord of Cambridge
and my kind lord of Masham...

308
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:58,498
and you, my gentle knight,
give me your thoughts.

309
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:01,543
Think you not that
the powers we bear with us...

310
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:04,379
will cut their passage
through the force of France?

311
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:07,883
No doubt, my liege, if each man
do his best. I doubt not that.

312
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,720
Never was monarch better feared
and loved than is your majesty.

313
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:15,015
We therefore have great
cause of thankfulness.

314
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:18,977
Uncle of Exeter, enlarge the
man committed yesterday...

315
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:21,104
that railed against
our person.

316
00:25:21,355 --> 00:25:25,526
We consider it was excess of
wine that set him on, [all chuckle]

317
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:27,486
And on his more advice
we pardon him.

318
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:30,072
That's mercy,
but too much security.

319
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:35,202
Let him be punished, lest example breed
by his sufferance, more of such a kind.

320
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:39,164
Oh, let us yet be merciful.

321
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:42,835
So may your highness,
and yet punish too.

322
00:25:43,377 --> 00:25:45,838
Sir, you show great mercy
if you give him life...

323
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:48,006
after the taste
of much correction.

324
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:51,802
Alas, your too much love
and care of me...

325
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:54,304
are heavy orisons
against this poor wretch.

326
00:25:54,805 --> 00:25:59,768
If little faults proceeding on
distemper shall not be winked at,

327
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:05,899
how shall we stretch our eye
when capital crimes, chewed,

328
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:08,527
swallowed and digested,
appear before us?

329
00:26:11,196 --> 00:26:13,448
We'll yet enlarge that man,

330
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:16,368
though Cambridge,
Scroop and Grey,

331
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:20,038
in their dear care
and tender preservation...

332
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:23,041
of our person
would have him punished.

333
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:27,421
And now to
our French causes.

334
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:31,800
Who are the late commissioners?
[Cambridge] I one, my lord.

335
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:34,052
Your highness bade me
ask for it today. So did you me.

336
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:36,972
- And I.
- Then, Richard Earl of cambridge, there is yours.

337
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:39,683
There yours,
Lord Scroop of Masham,

338
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:42,311
and sir knight, Grey of
Northumberland, this same is yours.

339
00:26:42,603 --> 00:26:43,812
Read them...

340
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:45,355
and know...

341
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:48,942
I know your worthiness.

342
00:26:52,154 --> 00:26:54,531
My Lord of Westmoreland,
uncle Exeter, we will aboard tonight.

343
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:02,039
Why, how now, gentlemen

344
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:05,751
what see you in those papers
that you lose so much complexion?

345
00:27:06,168 --> 00:27:09,671
I do confess my fault and do
submit me to your highness' mercy.

346
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:13,675
- To which we all appeal.
- The mercy that was quick in us of late...

347
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:16,053
by your own counsel
is suppressed and killed.

348
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:20,265
You must not dare for shame
to talk of mercy!

349
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:25,812
For your own reasons turn into your bosoms
as dogs upon their masters worrying you.

350
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:33,862
- [Shouting]
- [All shouting]

351
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:41,995
See you, my princes and my noble
peers, these English monsters.

352
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:45,374
What shall I say to thee,
Lord Scroop,

353
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:48,961
thou cruel, ingrateful,

354
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:52,464
savage and inhuman creature?

355
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:55,509
Thou knave thou!

356
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:58,971
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,
that knewest the very bottom of my soul,

357
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:01,098
that almost mightst have
coined me into gold,

358
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:03,642
which thou have practiced
on me for thy use.

359
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:06,436
May it be possible
that foreign hire...

360
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:10,858
could out of thee extract one spark
of evil that might annoy my finger?

361
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:12,985
'Tis so strange...

362
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:17,281
that though the truth of it stand
off as gross as black and white,

363
00:28:17,573 --> 00:28:19,783
my eye will scarcely see it.

364
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:25,080
So... constant and unspotted
didst thou seem...

365
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:29,001
that this thy fall
hath left a kind of blot...

366
00:28:29,126 --> 00:28:32,254
to mark
the full-fraught man...

367
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:36,008
and best indued
with some suspicion.

368
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:43,265
I will weep for thee.

369
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:49,021
For this revolt of thine, methinks,
is like another fall of man.

370
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:11,210
I arrest thee of high treason by the
name of Richard Earl of Cambridge.

371
00:29:13,754 --> 00:29:17,508
I arrest thee of high treason by the name
of Thomas Grey, Knight of Northumberland.

372
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:24,056
I arrest thee of high treason by the
name of Henry Lord Scroop of Masham.

373
00:29:29,645 --> 00:29:31,230
Hear your sentence.

374
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:34,399
You have conspired
against our royal person,

375
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:37,110
joined with an enemy
proclaimed and from his coffers...

376
00:29:37,236 --> 00:29:39,488
received the golden earnest
of our death wherein.

377
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:41,823
You would have sold your king
to slaughter,

378
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,159
his princes and his peers
to servitude,

379
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:46,119
his subjects to oppression
and contempt...

380
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:49,331
and his whole kingdom
into desolation!

381
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:56,296
Get you therefore hence, poor
miserable wretches, to your death,

382
00:29:57,047 --> 00:30:00,843
the taste whereof God of his mercy
give you patience to endure...

383
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:05,264
and true repentance
of all your dear offenses.

384
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:08,976
Bear them hence.

385
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:11,520
[Men shouting]

386
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:18,360
Now, Lords, for France,

387
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:21,989
the enterprise whereof shall
be to you, as us, like glorious,

388
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:26,159
since God so graciously hath brought to light
this dangerous treason lurking in our way.

389
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:28,912
Cheerly to sea.

390
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:31,498
The signs of war advance.

391
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:35,669
No king of England
if not king of France.

392
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:17,836
[Sighs]

393
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:22,716
Prithee, honey-sweet husband,
let me bring thee to staines.

394
00:31:23,008 --> 00:31:27,679
No, for my manly heart
doth yearn.

395
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:31,725
Bardolph, be blithe.

396
00:31:33,352 --> 00:31:36,355
Nym, rouse
thy vaunting veins.

397
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:40,984
Boy, bristle
thy courage up.

398
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:44,321
For Falstaff is dead,

399
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:47,407
and we must yearn therefore.

400
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:50,869
Would I were with him, wheresome'er
he is, either in heaven or in hell.

401
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:52,329
Nay, sure,
he's not in hell.

402
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:56,250
He's in Arthur's bosom, if ever
a man went to Arthur's bosom.

403
00:31:57,668 --> 00:32:01,296
He made a finer end and went away
an it had been any Christian child.

404
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:07,344
He parted even
just between 12:00 and 1:00,

405
00:32:10,264 --> 00:32:11,723
even at the turning of the tide.

406
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:16,353
For after I saw him
fumble with the sheets...

407
00:32:16,854 --> 00:32:21,066
and play with flowers and
smile upon his finger's ends,

408
00:32:22,943 --> 00:32:25,112
I knew there was
but one way.

409
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,826
For his nose
was as sharp as a pen,

410
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:36,123
and he babbled of green fields.

411
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:40,252
"How now, Sir John," quoth I.

412
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:41,795
"What, man?
Be of good cheer."

413
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:47,676
So he cried out,
"God, God,

414
00:32:49,261 --> 00:32:50,888
God,"

415
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:54,641
Three or four times.

416
00:32:58,562 --> 00:33:02,232
Now I, to comfort him, bid him
he should not think of God.

417
00:33:02,816 --> 00:33:05,527
I hoped there was no need to trouble himself
with any such thoughts yet.

418
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:12,409
He bade me put
more clothes on his feet.

419
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,039
I put my hand under the bed
and felt them,

420
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:23,128
and they were as cold
as any stone.

421
00:33:26,298 --> 00:33:28,008
Then I felt to his knees,

422
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:34,598
and so upward... and upward,

423
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,979
and all was as...

424
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:44,983
cold as any stone.

425
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:55,327
They say he cried out for sack.
[Laughs] That he did.

426
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:57,371
And of women.
No, that he did not.

427
00:33:57,829 --> 00:33:58,914
[Boy]
Yeah, that he did.

428
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:02,125
He said they were...
devils incarnate.

429
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:04,837
He could never abide carnation.
It was a color he never liked.

430
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:09,091
He said once the devil
would have him about women.

431
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:14,388
Well, he did in some sort...
handle women.

432
00:34:14,596 --> 00:34:16,014
[Laughing]

433
00:34:17,182 --> 00:34:19,643
But then he was rheumatic and
talked of the whore of Babylon.

434
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:24,147
Do you not remember he saw a flea
stick upon Bardolph's nose?

435
00:34:24,565 --> 00:34:27,609
He said it was a black soul
burning in hell. [chuckling]

436
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:30,863
Well, the fuel is gone
that maintained that fire.

437
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:33,115
That's all the riches
I got in his service.

438
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:39,580
Whall we shog?

439
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:42,791
The king will be gone
from Southampton.

440
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:01,018
Farewell, hostess.

441
00:35:03,395 --> 00:35:04,897
I cannot kiss.

442
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:07,065
That's the humor of it.

443
00:35:08,025 --> 00:35:09,234
But...

444
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:16,909
Adieu.

445
00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:33,759
Let housewifery appear.

446
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:37,471
[Chuckles]
Keep close.

447
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:42,351
I thee command.

448
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:45,646
[Knocking]

449
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:48,482
Farewell.

450
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:01,995
[Whispers]
Adieu.

451
00:36:09,378 --> 00:36:11,505
[Chorus]
Follow, follow.

452
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:16,301
For who is he whose chin is but
enriched with one appearing hair...

453
00:36:16,426 --> 00:36:20,305
that will not follow these
culled and choice-drawn cavaliers...

454
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:22,474
to France?

455
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:48,417
Thus comes the English...
with full power upon us,

456
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:55,591
and more than carefully it us concerns
to answer royally in our defenses.

457
00:36:58,385 --> 00:37:00,470
Therefore,
the dukes of Berri...

458
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:02,931
and of Bretagne,

459
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:07,227
of Brabant and of Orleans
shall make forth.

460
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:10,522
And you, prince Dauphin...

461
00:37:10,647 --> 00:37:12,149
My most redoubted father,

462
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:15,694
it is most meet we arm us
against the foe.

463
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:19,781
For peace itself
should not so dull a kingdom,

464
00:37:20,032 --> 00:37:22,701
but the defenses, musters,
preparations should be maintained,

465
00:37:22,826 --> 00:37:25,621
assembled and collected,
as were a war in expectation.

466
00:37:25,954 --> 00:37:29,166
Therefore, I say 'tis meet
we all go forth to view...

467
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:31,502
the sick and feeble
parts of France.

468
00:37:32,044 --> 00:37:34,713
And let us do it
with no show of fear!

469
00:37:35,297 --> 00:37:38,217
No, with no more than if we heard
that England were busied with,

470
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:41,470
uh, a Whitsun morris dance.
[Chuckling]

471
00:37:41,595 --> 00:37:45,390
For, my good liege, she is so idly
kinged by a vain, giddy, shallow,

472
00:37:45,557 --> 00:37:47,976
humorous youth,
that fear attends her not.

473
00:37:48,227 --> 00:37:49,561
O peace, prince dauphin.

474
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:52,314
You're too much mistaken
in this king.

475
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:55,734
Question, your grace,
the late ambassadors.

476
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:59,029
With what great state
he heard their embassy,

477
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:01,949
how well supplied
with noble counselors,

478
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:06,787
how modest in exception
and withal how terrible...

479
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:08,872
in constant resolution.

480
00:38:14,378 --> 00:38:16,046
Well, 'tis not so,
my lord high constable.

481
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:19,216
Though we think it so,
'tis no matter.

482
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:22,803
In matters of defense, 'tis best to weigh
the enemy more mighty than he seems.

483
00:38:23,262 --> 00:38:25,681
Think we king Harry strong.

484
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:32,396
And, princes, look you
strongly armed to meet him.

485
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:36,567
For he is bred
out of that bloody strain...

486
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:39,945
that haunted us
in our familiar paths.

487
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:43,866
Witness our too-much
memorable shame...

488
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:47,578
when cressy battle
fatally was struck...

489
00:38:49,454 --> 00:38:52,416
and all our princes captived...

490
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:55,127
by the hand
of that black name,

491
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:57,754
Edward,

492
00:38:58,213 --> 00:39:00,757
black prince of Wales.

493
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:08,599
This is a stem
of that victorious stalk.

494
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:12,853
And let us fear
the native mightiness...

495
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:15,480
and fate of him.

496
00:39:21,153 --> 00:39:24,531
[Door opens]
[Footsteps approaching]

497
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:39,880
Ambassadors from Harry, king of England,
do crave admittance to your majesty.

498
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:44,259
Go and bring them.

499
00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:50,265
You see, this chase
is hotly followed, friends.

500
00:39:57,648 --> 00:40:00,901
Good my sovereign,
take up the English short,

501
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:04,696
and let them know of what a
monarchy you are the head.

502
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:11,203
Self-love, my liege, is not so vile
a sin as self-neglecting.

503
00:40:12,955 --> 00:40:14,581
[Door opens]

504
00:40:28,303 --> 00:40:30,055
From our brother England?

505
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:34,268
From him, and thus
he greets your majesty.

506
00:40:35,561 --> 00:40:38,856
He wills you, in the
name of God almighty,

507
00:40:39,231 --> 00:40:41,650
that you divest yourself
and lay apart...

508
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:44,862
the borrowed glories
that by gift of heaven,

509
00:40:45,237 --> 00:40:46,905
by law of nature
and of nations,

510
00:40:47,072 --> 00:40:49,658
belongs to him
and to his heirs.

511
00:40:50,284 --> 00:40:53,370
Namely, the crown.

512
00:40:54,413 --> 00:40:56,748
Willing you overlook
this pedigree.

513
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:00,919
And when you find him
evenly derived...

514
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:05,257
from his most famed of famous
ancestors, Edward the III,

515
00:41:05,424 --> 00:41:11,180
he bids you then resign your crown
and kingdom, indirectly held from him,

516
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:14,057
the native and true challenger.

517
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:16,935
Or else what follows?

518
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:20,898
Bloody constraint.

519
00:41:21,815 --> 00:41:25,444
For if you hide the crown,
even in your hearts,

520
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:28,071
there will he rake for it.

521
00:41:28,614 --> 00:41:31,742
Therefore, in fierce
tempest is he coming,

522
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,953
in thunder and in earthquake,
like a Jove,

523
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:38,665
that if requiring fail,
he will compel.

524
00:41:40,626 --> 00:41:44,505
This is his claim,
his threatening and my message.

525
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:48,842
Unless the Dauphin
be in presence here,

526
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:51,386
to whom expressly
I bring greeting to.

527
00:41:51,803 --> 00:41:53,722
For the Dauphin,

528
00:41:55,432 --> 00:41:56,934
I stand here for him.

529
00:42:04,066 --> 00:42:05,609
What to him from England?

530
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:08,529
Scorn and defiance,

531
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:12,032
slight regard, contempt...

532
00:42:12,866 --> 00:42:16,203
and anything that might not
misbecome the mighty sender,

533
00:42:16,912 --> 00:42:18,747
doth he prize you at.

534
00:42:20,123 --> 00:42:21,625
Thus says my king.

535
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,463
Say, if my father render a fair
return, it is against my will,

536
00:42:26,588 --> 00:42:28,632
for I desire nothing
but odds with England.

537
00:42:29,424 --> 00:42:32,761
And to that end, as matching
to his youth and vanity,

538
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:35,472
I did present him
with the Paris balls!

539
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:38,559
He'll make your Paris Louvre
shake for it.

540
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:42,646
And be assured
you'll find a difference,

541
00:42:42,688 --> 00:42:45,190
as we, his subjects,
have in wonder found,

542
00:42:45,691 --> 00:42:48,902
between the promise of his greener
days and these he masters now.

543
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:52,447
Tomorrow...

544
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:56,034
Shall you know
our mind at full.

545
00:43:03,417 --> 00:43:06,378
[Chorus] Thus with imagined wing
our swift scene flies,

546
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,007
in motion of no less celerity
than that of thought! [explosion]

547
00:43:11,717 --> 00:43:15,262
Work, work your thoughts, and
in them see a siege! [men shouting]

548
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:17,014
Behold the ordinance
on their carriages,

549
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:19,933
with fatal mouths gaping
on girded harflew.

550
00:43:21,935 --> 00:43:23,896
Suppose the ambassador
from the French comes back,

551
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:26,607
tells Harry that the king does
offer him Katherine, his daughter,

552
00:43:26,732 --> 00:43:29,526
and with her to dowry, some
petty and unprofitable dukedoms.

553
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:31,570
The offer likes him not.

554
00:43:31,737 --> 00:43:34,781
And the nimble gunner with linstock
now the devilish cannon touches,

555
00:43:34,907 --> 00:43:37,910
and down goes all before them!

556
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,787
[Explosion]
[Shouting continues]

557
00:43:49,004 --> 00:43:51,507
Once more unto the breach,
dear friends!

558
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:55,844
Once more, or close the wall up
with our English dead!

559
00:43:56,428 --> 00:43:57,763
[Explosion]

560
00:44:06,772 --> 00:44:10,400
In peace there's nothing so becomes a
man as modest stillness and humility.

561
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:12,861
But when the blast of war
blows in our ears,

562
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:14,696
then imitate the action
of the tiger!

563
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:17,115
Stiffen the sinews,
summon up the blood,

564
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:19,826
disguise fair nature
with hard-favored rage.

565
00:44:19,993 --> 00:44:22,079
Then lend the eye
a terrible aspect.

566
00:44:22,162 --> 00:44:24,873
Let it pry through the portage of
the head like the brass cannon.

567
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:28,085
Let the brow o'erwhelm it as
fearfully as doth a galled rock...

568
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,420
o'erhang and jetty
his confounded base,

569
00:44:30,587 --> 00:44:32,714
swilled with the wild
and wasteful ocean.

570
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,134
Now set the teeth
and stretch the nostril wide,

571
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:41,306
hold hard the breath and bend up
every spirit to his full height!

572
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:44,893
On, on, you noblest England!

573
00:44:45,227 --> 00:44:46,812
[Explosion]

574
00:44:50,065 --> 00:44:54,069
Now attest that those whom you
called fathers did beget you.

575
00:44:54,444 --> 00:44:57,823
And you, good yeoman, whose
limbs were made in England,

576
00:44:57,948 --> 00:44:59,616
show us here the mettle
of your pasture.

577
00:44:59,825 --> 00:45:03,161
Let us swear that you are worth
your breeding, which I doubt not!

578
00:45:03,996 --> 00:45:08,959
For there is none of you so mean and base
that hath not noble luster in your eyes!

579
00:45:09,126 --> 00:45:13,338
I see you stand like greyhounds in
the slips, straining upon the start.

580
00:45:13,463 --> 00:45:16,133
The game's afoot!
Follow your spirit,

581
00:45:16,508 --> 00:45:20,053
and upon this charge, cry,
"God for Harry,

582
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:24,057
England and Saint George!"

583
00:45:25,976 --> 00:45:30,022
[All] God for harry,
England and Saint George!

584
00:45:30,731 --> 00:45:32,983
[All shouting]

585
00:45:34,693 --> 00:45:36,820
[Shouts of
encouragement]

586
00:45:40,073 --> 00:45:43,869
Up to the breach,
you dogs!

587
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:48,248
Avaunt, you cullions!

588
00:45:56,924 --> 00:45:58,133
[Panting]

589
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,928
Captain Fluellen, you must
come presently to the mines.

590
00:46:01,178 --> 00:46:03,180
The duke of Gloucester
would speak with you.

591
00:46:03,472 --> 00:46:06,225
Tell the duke it is not so good
to come to the mines.

592
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:09,853
For look you, the mines is not
according to the disciplines of war.

593
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:13,732
By Cheshu, I think he will
blow up all,

594
00:46:13,899 --> 00:46:16,026
if there is not
better direction. [explosion]

595
00:46:17,653 --> 00:46:19,238
The duke of Gloucester,
to whom the order...

596
00:46:19,404 --> 00:46:23,033
of the siege is given, is altogether
directed by an Irishman.

597
00:46:24,326 --> 00:46:26,745
[Trumpet blowing]
It's Captain Macmorris, is it not?

598
00:46:26,954 --> 00:46:30,207
- I think it be.
- By Cheshu, he is an ass in the world.

599
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:32,543
[Chuckles]
He has no more directions...

600
00:46:32,751 --> 00:46:35,963
in the true disciplines of the
wars than is a puppy dog.

601
00:46:38,048 --> 00:46:40,342
Here he comes, and the Scots
captain, Captain Jamy, with him.

602
00:46:40,634 --> 00:46:44,221
Oh, no, Captain Jamy is a marvelous,
valorous gentleman, that is certain.

603
00:46:44,763 --> 00:46:48,809
I say... good day,
Captain Fluellen.

604
00:46:49,017 --> 00:46:51,061
Good day to your worship,
good Captain James.

605
00:46:51,144 --> 00:46:54,398
How now, Captain Macmorris?
Have you quit the mines? By Christ, la.

606
00:46:54,648 --> 00:46:56,483
The workish give over.

607
00:46:56,692 --> 00:46:58,151
The trumpets
sound the retreat.

608
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,404
By my hand,
'tis ill done.

609
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,699
Captain Macmorris,
I beseech you now,

610
00:47:03,949 --> 00:47:07,202
a few disputations as partly
touching the disciplines of the war,

611
00:47:07,411 --> 00:47:09,621
partly to satisfy
my opinion...

612
00:47:09,663 --> 00:47:12,207
and partly for
the satisfaction of my mind,

613
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:15,335
as touching the direction
of the military discipline.

614
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:18,630
That is the point. It is no time
to discourse, so Christ save me.

615
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:20,966
The town is besieged, and the
trumpet calls us to the breach.

616
00:47:21,175 --> 00:47:23,260
We talk, and, by Christ,
do nothing.

617
00:47:23,677 --> 00:47:26,555
By the mass, ere these eyes of mine
take themselves to slumber,

618
00:47:26,972 --> 00:47:30,350
I'll do good service, or I'll
lie in the ground for it.

619
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,061
Captain Macmorris,
I think, look you,

620
00:47:33,312 --> 00:47:35,772
under your correction, there
are not many of your nation.

621
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:38,859
[Explosion]
What is my nation?

622
00:47:39,985 --> 00:47:41,820
Who talks of my nation
is a villain...

623
00:47:41,945 --> 00:47:45,073
and a bastard and a knave
and a rascal?

624
00:47:45,824 --> 00:47:49,995
Look you, if you take the matter otherwise
than it is meant, Captain Macmorris,

625
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,164
peradventure I shall think
you do not use me...

626
00:47:52,289 --> 00:47:57,002
with that affability as in discretion
you ought to use me, now look you,

627
00:47:57,127 --> 00:47:59,922
being as good
a man as yourself.

628
00:48:00,339 --> 00:48:02,841
I do not know you
so good a man as myself.

629
00:48:03,342 --> 00:48:06,261
So Christ save me,
I will cut off your head!

630
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:12,476
[Shouts]
[Rumbling]

631
00:48:18,106 --> 00:48:20,067
[Men shouting]

632
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:26,907
[Explosion]

633
00:48:34,248 --> 00:48:36,375
How yet resolves
the governor of the town?

634
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:40,379
This is the latest parle
we will admit.

635
00:48:41,547 --> 00:48:44,258
Therefore, to our best mercy
give yourselves,

636
00:48:44,383 --> 00:48:47,970
or, like to men proud of
destruction, defy us to our worst.

637
00:48:49,221 --> 00:48:52,266
For as I am a soldier, if I
begin the battery once again,

638
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:54,476
I will not leave
the half-achieved Harflew...

639
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:57,437
till in her ashes
she lie buried.

640
00:48:58,689 --> 00:49:00,732
Therefore,
you men of Harflew,

641
00:49:01,275 --> 00:49:03,861
take pity of your town
and of your people...

642
00:49:04,027 --> 00:49:06,989
whiles yet my soldiers
are in my command,

643
00:49:07,364 --> 00:49:10,784
whiles yet the cool
and temperate wind of grace...

644
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:14,663
o'erblows the filthy
and contagious clouds...

645
00:49:15,163 --> 00:49:19,418
of heady murder,
spoil and villainy!

646
00:49:20,252 --> 00:49:24,965
If not, why, in a moment
look to see...

647
00:49:25,215 --> 00:49:29,011
the blind and bloody
soldier with foul hand...

648
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:32,723
defile the locks of your shrill,
shrieking daughters,

649
00:49:32,764 --> 00:49:35,309
your fathers taken
by their silvered beards...

650
00:49:35,434 --> 00:49:37,811
and their most reverend heads
dashed to the walls,

651
00:49:38,312 --> 00:49:41,773
your naked infants
spitted upon pikes...

652
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:46,653
whiles the mad mothers
with their howls confused...

653
00:49:46,904 --> 00:49:49,406
do break the clouds!

654
00:49:50,532 --> 00:49:52,034
What say you?

655
00:49:52,284 --> 00:49:56,038
Will you yield and this avoid?

656
00:49:56,788 --> 00:49:59,791
Or, guilty in defense,

657
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:02,419
be thus destroyed?

658
00:50:03,462 --> 00:50:07,007
The Dauphin, of whose
succor we entreated,

659
00:50:07,216 --> 00:50:12,471
returns us that his powers are not
yet ready to raise so great a siege.

660
00:50:13,305 --> 00:50:16,266
Therefore, dread king,

661
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:21,480
enter our gates,
dispose of us and ours,

662
00:50:24,691 --> 00:50:26,777
for we no longer
are defensible.

663
00:50:29,154 --> 00:50:30,906
[Sighs]

664
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:58,475
Go you and enter Harflew.

665
00:50:58,725 --> 00:51:02,104
There remain and fortify it
strongly against the French.

666
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:06,066
Use... mercy to them all.

667
00:51:09,945 --> 00:51:12,739
For us, dear uncle,
the winter coming on...

668
00:51:13,073 --> 00:51:15,701
and sickness growing
upon our soldiers,

669
00:51:15,951 --> 00:51:18,996
we will retire to Calais.

670
00:51:22,374 --> 00:51:25,460
Tonight... in Harflew
will we be your guest.

671
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:30,215
Tomorrow... for the march
are we addressed.

672

[Sighs]

675
00:52:07,669 --> 00:52:09,463
Alice,
tu as ete en angleterre,

676
00:52:10,088 --> 00:52:11,590
et tu parles bien le langage.

677
00:52:12,424 --> 00:52:13,967
Un peu, madame.

678
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:16,553
Je te prie, m'enseignez.

679
00:52:18,263 --> 00:52:19,890
Il faut que j'apprenne
a parler.

680
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:23,268
Comment appelez-vous
la main en anglais?

681
00:52:23,727 --> 00:52:26,438
La main?
Elle est appelee"de" hand.

682
00:52:28,315 --> 00:52:30,400
"De hand."
Mm-hmm.

683
00:52:31,902 --> 00:52:33,070
Et les doigts?

684
00:52:33,195 --> 00:52:36,323
Les doigts?
Ma foi, j'oublie les doigts.

685
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:38,700
Mais je me souviendrai.
Les doigts?

686
00:52:38,992 --> 00:52:42,454
Je pense qu'ils sont appeles
"de fingres."

687
00:52:44,957 --> 00:52:48,919
Le main, de hand.
Le doigts, de fingres.

688
00:52:49,503 --> 00:52:50,838
Mm-hmm.

689
00:52:52,297 --> 00:52:53,715
Je pense que je suis
le bon ecolier.

690
00:52:53,882 --> 00:52:55,759
J'ai gagne deux mots
d'anglais vitement. [mutters]

691
00:52:56,635 --> 00:52:59,263
Comment appelez-vous les ongles?
Les ongles?

692
00:52:59,346 --> 00:53:01,014
Nous les appelons
de nails.

693
00:53:02,307 --> 00:53:03,934
"De nails."

694
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:07,646
Ecoutez, dites-moi
si je parle bien.

695
00:53:07,896 --> 00:53:14,027
De hand, de fingres
etde nails.

696
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:17,197
C'est bien dit, madame.
Il est fort bon anglais. [laughs]

697
00:53:18,574 --> 00:53:20,284
Dites-moi I'anglais
pour le bras.

698
00:53:20,659 --> 00:53:22,744
De arm, madame.
Et le coude?

De tous les mots que vous
m'avez appris des a present.

703
00:53:34,339 --> 00:53:37,176
Il est trop difficile,
madame, comme je pense.

704
00:53:37,301 --> 00:53:40,345
Excusez-moi, Alice,
ecoutez: De hand, de fingres,

705

de nails, de "arma,"

O, seigneur dieu,

707
00:53:48,353 --> 00:53:49,771
Comment appelez-vous

708
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,690

Le menton, de chin.

714

Oui, sauf votre honneur,

vous prononcez les mots aussi
droit que les natifs d'angleterre.

716

Je ne doute point d'apprendre par la
grace de dieu, et en peu de temps.

717
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:19,176
N'avez-vous pas deja oublie
ce que je vous ai enseigne?

718

Non, je reciterai

'Tis certain...
He hath passed the river Somme.

You have power enough.

Rouen bring him our prisoner.

shall see our army,

he'll drop his heart
into the sink of fear...

offer us his ransom.

haste on montjoy.

you shall stay with us in Rouen.

shall remain with us!

horse whinnies] [man shouts]

776
00:59:28,902 --> 00:59:30,487
Come. Come in.

777
00:59:36,618 --> 00:59:37,786
Captain Fluellen?

778
00:59:39,204 --> 00:59:41,540
Come you from the bridge?
Is the duke of Exeter safe?

779
00:59:42,124 --> 00:59:45,043
De is not...
God be praised and blessed...

780
00:59:45,377 --> 00:59:49,923
any hurt in the world, but keeps the bridge
most valiantly, with excellent discipline.

781
00:59:51,884 --> 00:59:55,929
Captain! I thee beseech
to do me favors.

782
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,142
The duke of Exeter
doth love thee well.

783
01:00:00,809 --> 01:00:04,771
Aye, I praise God, and I have
merited some love at his hands.

784
01:00:05,272 --> 01:00:08,150
Bardolph, a soldier firm
and sound of heart...

785
01:00:08,358 --> 01:00:10,444
and buxom valor,

786
01:00:10,736 --> 01:00:16,450
hath by cruel fate and giddy
fortune's furious, fickle wheel...

787
01:00:16,658 --> 01:00:19,411
Touching your patience,
Ancient Pistol,

788
01:00:20,704 --> 01:00:22,789
fortune is an excellent moral.

789
01:00:23,457 --> 01:00:27,211
Fortune is Bardolph's foe
and frowns on him...

790
01:00:27,586 --> 01:00:31,798
for he hath stolen a pax
and hanged must he be.

791
01:00:32,216 --> 01:00:34,343
Therefore, go speak.

792
01:00:35,177 --> 01:00:37,763
The duke will hear thy voice.

793
01:00:39,765 --> 01:00:42,601
Speak, captain, for his life,

794
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:45,479
and I will thee requite.

795
01:00:46,647 --> 01:00:49,983
Ancient Pistol, I do partly
understand your meaning.

796
01:00:50,776 --> 01:00:53,529
Why, then,
rejoice therefore!

797
01:00:54,821 --> 01:00:57,157
'Tis not a thing
to rejoice at.

798
01:00:58,367 --> 01:01:01,495
Look you, if he
were my brother,

799
01:01:01,787 --> 01:01:04,331
I would desire the duke
to do his good pleasure...

800
01:01:04,498 --> 01:01:06,667
and put him to execution.

801
01:01:08,544 --> 01:01:10,045
[Fluellen]
Discipline ought to be used.

802
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:14,550
Then die and be damned...

803
01:01:15,008 --> 01:01:18,804
and figo for thy friendship!

804
01:01:33,819 --> 01:01:36,321
How now, Fluellen,
comest thou from the bridge?

805
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,490
Aye, so please your majesty.

806
01:01:38,532 --> 01:01:42,119
The duke of Exeter hath very
gallantly maintained the bridge.

807
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:45,789
What men have you lost?

808
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:48,542
I think the duke
hath lost never a man...

809
01:01:53,547 --> 01:01:56,550
but one that is like to be
executed for robbing a church.

810
01:01:58,677 --> 01:02:01,763
One Bardolph, if
your majesty know the man.

811
01:02:03,015 --> 01:02:06,435
[Fluellen] His face is all bubukles and
whelks and knobs and flames of fire.

812
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:09,521
His lips blows at his nose.

813
01:02:09,688 --> 01:02:12,399
[Fluellen] 'tis like a coal of fire...
sometimes blue, sometimes red.

814
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:17,988
But his nose is executed
and his fire's out.

815
01:02:23,744 --> 01:02:25,037
Get up!

816
01:02:34,505 --> 01:02:36,673
[Thunder rumbling]

817
01:02:46,767 --> 01:02:48,352

820
01:02:57,611 --> 01:02:59,947

[Laughing]

823
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:14,503
Do not, when thou art king,
hang a thief.

824
01:03:17,923 --> 01:03:19,591
No,

825
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:25,013
thou shalt.

826
01:03:32,896 --> 01:03:35,148
[Thunder rumbling]

827
01:03:59,715 --> 01:04:02,176
We would have all such offenders
so cut off.

828
01:04:05,512 --> 01:04:07,514
We give express charge
that in our marches...

829
01:04:07,723 --> 01:04:11,268
through the country there be nothing
compelled from the villages,

830
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:14,688
nothing taken but paid for,

831
01:04:16,815 --> 01:04:20,777
none of the French upbraided
or abused in disdainful language.

832
01:04:23,197 --> 01:04:25,991
For when lenity and cruelty
play for a kingdom,

833
01:04:28,535 --> 01:04:33,081
the gentler gamester
is the soonest winner.

834
01:04:58,524 --> 01:05:01,568
Thus says my king,
"Say thou to Harry of England,

835
01:05:01,777 --> 01:05:03,820
"though we seemed dead,
we did but sleep.

836
01:05:03,987 --> 01:05:06,448
"Tell him we could have
rebuked him at Harflew.

837
01:05:07,241 --> 01:05:10,410
"Now we speak,
and our voice is imperial.

838
01:05:10,494 --> 01:05:13,413
"England shall
repent his folly.

839
01:05:13,747 --> 01:05:15,749
"Bid him, therefore,
consider of his ransom...

840
01:05:15,791 --> 01:05:18,252
"which must proportion
the losses we have borne...

841
01:05:18,377 --> 01:05:22,005
"which in weight to re-answer
his pettiness would bow under.

842
01:05:22,214 --> 01:05:26,468
"To this add defiance,
and tell him, for conclusion,

843
01:05:26,677 --> 01:05:28,720
"he hath betrayed
his followers...

844
01:05:28,762 --> 01:05:30,764
whose condemnation
is pronounced."

845
01:05:32,391 --> 01:05:35,853
So far my king and master,
so much my office.

846
01:05:38,063 --> 01:05:40,315
- What is thy name?
- Montjoy.

847
01:05:41,149 --> 01:05:43,360
Thou dost thy office fairly.

848
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:48,866
Turn thee back, and tell
thy king I do not seek him now,

849
01:05:48,991 --> 01:05:51,910
but could be willing to march on
to Calais without impeachment.

850
01:05:53,203 --> 01:05:55,372
Go, therefore,
tell thy master here I am.

851
01:05:56,123 --> 01:05:59,168
My ransom is this
frail and worthless trunk,

852
01:06:00,043 --> 01:06:02,880
my army but a weak
and sickly guard.

853
01:06:03,088 --> 01:06:05,924
Yet, God before,
tell him we will come on,

854
01:06:06,341 --> 01:06:10,262
though France himself and such
another neighbor stand in our way.

855
01:06:11,305 --> 01:06:13,056
So, Montjoy, fare you well.

856
01:06:13,515 --> 01:06:15,767
The sum of all our answer
is but this:

857
01:06:16,268 --> 01:06:19,188
We would not seek
a battle as we are,

858
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,817
nor, as we are,
we say we will not shun it.

859
01:06:27,404 --> 01:06:28,906
So tell your master.

860
01:06:30,407 --> 01:06:31,909
I shall deliver so.

861
01:06:33,368 --> 01:06:35,078
Thanks to your majesty.

862
01:06:54,598 --> 01:06:56,808
I hope they will not
come upon us now.

863
01:06:56,850 --> 01:07:00,312
We are in god's hand, brother,
not in theirs.

[Thunderclap]

865
01:07:16,411 --> 01:07:17,746
March to the bridge.

866
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:19,873
It now draws towards night.

867
01:07:20,666 --> 01:07:22,918
Beyond the river
we'll encamp ourselves...

868
01:07:23,335 --> 01:07:25,003
and on tomorrow...

869
01:07:28,257 --> 01:07:31,593
bid them march away.

870
01:08:26,064 --> 01:08:28,984
Now entertain
conjecture of a time...

871
01:08:29,151 --> 01:08:32,070
when creeping murmur
and the poring dark...

872

fills the wide vessel
of the universe.

873

From camp to camp through
the foul womb of night...

874
01:08:40,996 --> 01:08:43,457
the hum of either army
stilly sounds...

875
01:08:43,707 --> 01:08:47,085
that the fixed sentinels
almost receive...

876
01:08:47,252 --> 01:08:49,046
the secret whispers
of each other's watch.

877
01:08:50,255 --> 01:08:51,840
Fire answers fire,

878
01:08:52,049 --> 01:08:54,009
and through their paly flames,

879
01:08:54,301 --> 01:08:56,803
each battle sees
the other's umbered face.

880
01:08:57,346 --> 01:08:59,932
Steed threatens steed
in high and boastful neighs,

881
01:09:00,349 --> 01:09:01,975
piercing the night's dull ear.

882
01:09:02,142 --> 01:09:04,394
And from the tents,

883
01:09:05,687 --> 01:09:07,940
the armorers,
accomplishing the knights,

884
01:09:08,398 --> 01:09:13,070
with busy hammers closing rivets up
give dreadful note of preparation.

885
01:09:14,613 --> 01:09:16,990
Proud of their numbers
and secure in soul,

886
01:09:17,491 --> 01:09:19,576
the confident
and over-lusty French...

887
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:22,079
do the low-rated English
play at dice...

888
01:09:22,287 --> 01:09:26,083
and chide the cripple,
tardy-gaited night...

889
01:09:26,291 --> 01:09:31,380
who, like a foul and ugly witch,
doth limp so tediously away.

My lord of Orleans
and my lord High Constable,

898
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:15,382
you talk of horse and armor?

899
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:18,802
You are as well provided of both
as any prince in the world.

900
01:10:20,512 --> 01:10:22,264
I will not change my horse...

for any that treads
but on four hooves.

When I bestride him,
I soar.

I am a hawk, and he is
pure air and fire!

The dull elements of earth
and water never appear in him,

905
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:42,201
but only impatient stillness
while his rider mounts him.

906
01:10:42,868 --> 01:10:47,164
Indeed, my lord, it is a most
absolute and excellent horse.

[Chattering continues]

My lord constable,
the armor in your tent tonight...

01:10:54,379 --> 01:10:55,714
Are those suns
or stars on it?

910
01:10:56,006 --> 01:10:58,383
Stars, Montjoy.

911
01:10:59,176 --> 01:11:01,053
Some of them will
fall tomorrow, I hope.

912
01:11:01,303 --> 01:11:03,263
And yet my sky
shall not want.

913

Will it never be day?

914
01:11:12,731 --> 01:11:14,775
I will trot tomorrow a mile,

915
01:11:15,234 --> 01:11:17,903
and my way shall be paved
with English faces.

916
01:11:18,612 --> 01:11:23,283
I will not say so, for fear I
should be faced out of my way.

917
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:33,710
I'll go arm myself.

I think he will eat
all he kills.

922

He never did harm that I heard of.
Nor will do none tomorrow.

the dawning as we do.

they would run away.

01:12:31,643 --> 01:12:35,022
But let me see, by 10:00, we shall
have each a hundred Englishmen.

933
01:12:41,361 --> 01:12:43,614
The poor, condemned English,

934
01:12:44,573 --> 01:12:46,533
like sacrifices,

935
01:12:47,409 --> 01:12:50,621
by their watchful fires
sit patiently...

936
01:12:50,829 --> 01:12:54,708
and inly ruminate
the morning's danger.

937
01:13:05,636 --> 01:13:07,304
[Chorus]
And their gesture sad,

938
01:13:07,554 --> 01:13:11,642
investing lank, lean cheeks
and war-worn coats,

939
01:13:12,309 --> 01:13:14,895
presenteth them
unto the gazing moon...

940
01:13:16,563 --> 01:13:19,066
so many horrid ghosts.

941
01:13:19,525 --> 01:13:21,485
## [Flute]

942
01:13:22,778 --> 01:13:24,571
Ahh.

943
01:13:39,253 --> 01:13:42,172
[Laughing]

944
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:54,268
Oh, now,

945
01:13:55,394 --> 01:13:58,647
who will behold the royal
captain of this ruined band,

946
01:14:00,023 --> 01:14:03,151
walking from watch to watch,
from tent to tent?

947
01:14:04,903 --> 01:14:08,240
Let him cry,
"Praise and glory on his head,"

948
01:14:09,241 --> 01:14:13,370
For forth he goes
and visits all his host.

949
01:14:14,371 --> 01:14:16,790
Bids them good morrow
with a modest smile...

950
01:14:17,708 --> 01:14:21,795
and calls them "Brothers,
friends and countrymen."

951
01:14:23,255 --> 01:14:25,924
A largesse universal,
like the sun...

952
01:14:26,967 --> 01:14:29,094
his liberal eye
doth give to everyone,

953
01:14:30,262 --> 01:14:32,014
thawing cold fear...

954
01:14:32,931 --> 01:14:35,100
that mean and gentle all...

955
01:14:36,059 --> 01:14:38,854
behold, as may
unworthiness define,

956
01:14:39,938 --> 01:14:42,274
a little touch of Harry
in the night.

957
01:14:44,484 --> 01:14:46,236
Good morrow, old
sir Thomas Erpingham.

958
01:14:46,778 --> 01:14:50,282
A good soft pillow for that good white head
were better than a churlish turf of France.

959
01:14:51,074 --> 01:14:54,411
Not so, my liege.
This lodging likes me better...

960
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:58,290
since I may say,
"Now lie I like a king."

961
01:14:58,665 --> 01:15:01,877
[Chuckles]
Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas.

962
01:15:03,962 --> 01:15:06,465
Brothers both, commend me
to the princes in our camp.

963
01:15:06,673 --> 01:15:09,635
Do my good morrow to them, and
anon desire them all to my pavilion.

964
01:15:10,344 --> 01:15:11,512
We shall, my liege.

965
01:15:16,517 --> 01:15:18,852
Shall I attend your grace?
No, my good knight.

966
01:15:19,937 --> 01:15:22,439
I and my bosom
must debate a while,

967
01:15:23,815 --> 01:15:25,442
and then I would
no other company.

968
01:15:26,652 --> 01:15:29,738
The lord in heaven
bless thee, noble Harry.

969
01:15:36,328 --> 01:15:38,080
God have mercy, old heart.

970
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,333
Thou speakest cheerfully.

971
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,303
[Clears throat]
Qui va la?

972
01:15:54,972 --> 01:15:56,473
A friend.

973
01:15:57,391 --> 01:15:58,851
Discuss unto me.

974
01:16:00,227 --> 01:16:01,687
Art thou officer...

975
01:16:02,104 --> 01:16:05,357
or art thou base,
common and popular?

976
01:16:06,692 --> 01:16:08,485
I am a gentleman of a company.

977
01:16:09,862 --> 01:16:12,614
Trailest thou
the puissant pike? Even so.

978
01:16:13,699 --> 01:16:17,536
What are you?
As good a gentleman as the emperor.

979
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,122
Ah, then you are a better
than the king.

980
01:16:22,499 --> 01:16:26,461
The king's a bawcock
and a heart of gold,

981
01:16:27,629 --> 01:16:30,090
a lad of life,
an imp of fame,

982
01:16:30,883 --> 01:16:33,844
of parents good,
of fist most valiant.

983
01:16:36,388 --> 01:16:38,182
I kiss his dirty shoe,

984
01:16:39,433 --> 01:16:42,686
and from heartstring,
I love the lovely bully.

985
01:16:48,192 --> 01:16:49,359
What is thy name?

986
01:16:49,526 --> 01:16:53,071
Uh, Harry Le Roy.
Le Roy?

987
01:16:53,697 --> 01:16:55,699
A... a Cornish name?

988
01:16:56,283 --> 01:16:57,993
No, I am a Welshman.

989
01:17:00,746 --> 01:17:03,081
Knowest thou Fluellen?
Aye.

990
01:17:03,957 --> 01:17:08,045
Tell him I'll knock his leek about
his pate upon Saint Davy's day.

991
01:17:08,921 --> 01:17:12,174
Do not wear your dagger in your cap
that day, lest he knock that about yours.

992
01:17:14,468 --> 01:17:15,636
Art thou his friend?

993
01:17:15,761 --> 01:17:17,429
And his kinsman too.

994
01:17:18,639 --> 01:17:20,766
The figo with thee then.
I thank you.

995
01:17:21,517 --> 01:17:22,643
God be with you.

996
01:17:23,644 --> 01:17:25,771
My name is Pistol called.

997
01:17:26,605 --> 01:17:28,607
It sorts well
with your fierceness.

998
01:17:36,114 --> 01:17:37,658
Captain Fluellen.
Shh!

999
01:17:41,453 --> 01:17:43,163
In the name of Jesus Christ,
speak lower.

1000
01:17:49,461 --> 01:17:52,756
If you would take the pains but to
examine the wars of Pompey the great,

1001
01:17:53,465 --> 01:17:58,554
you shall find that there is no Tiddle
Taddle nor Pibble Babble in Pompey's camp.

1002
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,640
The enemy is loud.
You hear him all night.

1003
01:18:03,392 --> 01:18:06,687
If the enemy is an ass and
a fool and a prating coxcomb,

1004
01:18:07,104 --> 01:18:09,273
is it meet that we should
also be an ass...

1005
01:18:09,481 --> 01:18:13,151
and a fool and a prating coxcomb
in your conscience now?

1006
01:18:15,571 --> 01:18:17,114
[Whispers]
I will speak lower.

1007
01:18:18,156 --> 01:18:20,284
I pray you and beseech you
that you will.

1008
01:18:28,834 --> 01:18:30,627
[Man murmuring]

1009
01:18:32,462 --> 01:18:34,840
[Speaking in
foreign language]

1010
01:18:42,556 --> 01:18:44,516
[Foreign language continues]

1011
01:18:49,396 --> 01:18:50,856
Brother John Bates,

1012
01:18:52,316 --> 01:18:54,776
Is not that the morning
which breaks yonder?

1013
01:18:55,444 --> 01:18:56,695
I think it be,

1014
01:18:57,112 --> 01:19:00,824
but we have no great cause
to desire the approach of day.

1015
01:19:02,367 --> 01:19:04,161
We see yonder
the beginning of the day,

1016
01:19:06,455 --> 01:19:08,415
but I think we shall
never see the end of it.

1017
01:19:09,041 --> 01:19:10,334
[Twig snaps]

1018
01:19:12,544 --> 01:19:15,839
Who goes there?
A friend.

1019
01:19:16,882 --> 01:19:18,342
Under what captain serve ya?

1020
01:19:18,759 --> 01:19:21,428
Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.

1021
01:19:27,643 --> 01:19:31,063
A good old commander
and a most kind gentleman.

1022
01:19:33,106 --> 01:19:36,026
I pray ya, what thinks he
of our estate?

1023
01:19:37,277 --> 01:19:39,488
Even as men
wrecked upon a sand...

1024
01:19:40,447 --> 01:19:42,658
that look to be washed off
with the next tide.

1025
01:19:44,076 --> 01:19:45,744
He hath not told
his thought to the king?

1026
01:19:46,203 --> 01:19:48,872
No, nor it is not
meet he should.

1027
01:19:50,207 --> 01:19:52,251
I think the king
is but a man as I am.

1028
01:19:53,210 --> 01:19:55,587
The violet smells to him
as it doth to me.

1029
01:19:56,588 --> 01:19:58,382
His ceremonies laid by,

1030
01:19:58,924 --> 01:20:00,759
in his nakedness
he appears but a man.

1031
01:20:01,885 --> 01:20:04,263
Therefore, when he sees
reason to fear, as we do,

1032
01:20:04,471 --> 01:20:07,516
his fears, out of doubt,
be of the same relish as ours are.

1033
01:20:07,683 --> 01:20:09,685
He may show what
outward courage he will,

1034
01:20:10,519 --> 01:20:12,521
but I believe as
cold a night as 'tis...

1035
01:20:12,729 --> 01:20:15,190
that he could wish himself
in Thames up to the neck.

1036
01:20:16,024 --> 01:20:19,069
[Bates] And so I would he were,
and I by him.

1037
01:20:20,529 --> 01:20:22,614
At all adventures,
so we were quit here.

1038
01:20:24,116 --> 01:20:26,952
I think he would not wish himself
anywhere but where he is.

1039
01:20:27,536 --> 01:20:29,246
Then I would
he were here alone.

1040
01:20:32,416 --> 01:20:34,835
Methinks I could not die
anywhere so contented...

1041
01:20:35,169 --> 01:20:36,837
as in the king's company,

1042
01:20:37,254 --> 01:20:41,049
his cause being just
and his quarrel honorable.

1043
01:20:42,342 --> 01:20:44,219
That's more than we know.

1044
01:20:44,469 --> 01:20:46,221
Aye, and more than
we should seek after.

1045
01:20:46,638 --> 01:20:48,849
We know enough if we know
we are the king's subject.

1046
01:20:49,391 --> 01:20:52,728
If his cause be wrong,
our obedience to the king...

1047
01:20:52,895 --> 01:20:54,771
wipes the crime of it
out of us.

1048
01:20:58,317 --> 01:20:59,902
But if the cause be not good,

1049
01:21:00,527 --> 01:21:03,405
the king himself hath
a heavy reckoning to make.

1050
01:21:04,781 --> 01:21:07,075
And all those legs
and arms and heads...

1051
01:21:07,242 --> 01:21:08,702
chopped off in the battle...

1052
01:21:08,952 --> 01:21:12,122
will join together at
the latter day and cry all,

1053
01:21:13,081 --> 01:21:15,792
"we died at such a place."

1054
01:21:18,086 --> 01:21:21,089
Some swearing,
some crying for a surgeon,

1055
01:21:22,216 --> 01:21:25,219
some upon their wives
left poor behind them,

1056
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:27,846
some upon the debts they owe,

1057
01:21:28,805 --> 01:21:30,849
some upon their children
rawly left.

1058
01:21:37,314 --> 01:21:39,274
I'm afeared
there are few die well...

1059
01:21:40,275 --> 01:21:41,527
that die in a battle...

1060
01:21:42,152 --> 01:21:45,656
for how can they charitably
dispose of anything...

1061
01:21:45,697 --> 01:21:48,158
when blood is their argument?

1062
01:21:50,327 --> 01:21:53,205
Now if these men
do not die well,

1063
01:21:54,122 --> 01:21:58,168
it will be a black matter for
the king that led them to it.

1064
01:21:59,837 --> 01:22:03,257
So if a son that is by his father
sent about merchandise...

1065
01:22:03,423 --> 01:22:05,509
do sinfully miscarry
upon the sea,

1066
01:22:05,968 --> 01:22:08,178
the imputation of
his wickedness, by your rule,

1067
01:22:08,470 --> 01:22:10,889
should be imposed upon
the father that sent him?

1068
01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:13,267
But this is not so.

1069
01:22:13,559 --> 01:22:17,271
The king is not bound to answer the
particular endings of his soldiers...

1070
01:22:17,563 --> 01:22:19,439
nor the father of his son,

1071
01:22:20,232 --> 01:22:23,318
for they purpose not their deaths
when they purpose their services.

1072
01:22:25,404 --> 01:22:29,283
Besides, there is no king,
be his cause never so spotless,

1073
01:22:30,075 --> 01:22:33,871
can try it out with
all unspotted soldiers.

1074
01:22:36,039 --> 01:22:38,292
Every subject's duty
is the king's,

1075
01:22:39,084 --> 01:22:43,422
but every subject's soul
is his own.

1076
01:22:51,305 --> 01:22:52,764
'Tis certain.

1077
01:22:53,765 --> 01:22:56,894
Eevery man that dies ill,
the ill upon his own head.

1078
01:22:57,769 --> 01:22:59,813
The king is not to answer it.

1079
01:23:00,772 --> 01:23:02,524
I do not desire
he should answer for me.

1080
01:23:03,108 --> 01:23:05,903
Yet I determine
to fight lustily for him.

1081
01:23:07,946 --> 01:23:10,032
I myself heard the king say
he would not be ransomed.

1082
01:23:10,407 --> 01:23:13,327
Aye, he said so
to make us fight cheerfully.

1083
01:23:14,286 --> 01:23:17,080
But when our throats are cut, he may
be ransomed, and we ne'er the wiser.

1084
01:23:17,539 --> 01:23:20,876
If I live to see it,
I'll never trust his word after.

1085
01:23:21,376 --> 01:23:22,878
You pay him then!

1086
01:23:27,007 --> 01:23:29,218
You'll never trust
his word after?

1087
01:23:30,969 --> 01:23:33,347
Come. 'tis a foolish saying.

1088
01:23:34,223 --> 01:23:35,933
Your reproof
is something too round.

1089
01:23:36,558 --> 01:23:38,644
I should be angry with you
if time were convenient.

1090
01:23:38,769 --> 01:23:41,104
Let it be a quarrel between us,
if you live!

1091
01:23:42,898 --> 01:23:44,775
Be friends,
you English fools! Be friends!

1092
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:46,276
We have French quarrels enough!

1093
01:24:07,506 --> 01:24:08,715
Upon the king.

1094
01:24:09,925 --> 01:24:13,846
Let us our lives,
our souls, our debts,

1095
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:17,474
our careful wives,
our children...

1096
01:24:18,892 --> 01:24:21,061
and our sins lay on the king.

1097
01:24:22,521 --> 01:24:24,273
We must bear all.

1098
01:24:25,482 --> 01:24:28,277
Oh, hard condition.

1099
01:24:29,862 --> 01:24:31,446
Twin-born with greatness,

1100
01:24:32,489 --> 01:24:34,867
subject to the breath
of every fool.

1101
01:24:36,243 --> 01:24:39,121
What infinite heart's ease
must kings neglect...

1102
01:24:39,413 --> 01:24:41,081
that private men enjoy?

1103
01:24:42,541 --> 01:24:45,502
And what have kings
that privates have not too...

1104
01:24:46,503 --> 01:24:48,213
save ceremony?

1105
01:24:49,381 --> 01:24:52,217
And what art thou,
thou idle ceremony?

1106
01:24:54,261 --> 01:24:57,931
What drinks thou oft instead of
homage sweet but poison flattery?

1107
01:24:58,473 --> 01:25:02,769
Oh, be sick, great greatness,
and bid thy ceremony give thee cure.

1108
01:25:04,188 --> 01:25:07,107
Canst thou, when thou
commandest the beggar's knee,

1109
01:25:07,691 --> 01:25:09,359
command the health of it?

1110
01:25:18,452 --> 01:25:21,246
No, thou proud dream,

1111
01:25:22,664 --> 01:25:26,585
that playest so subtly
with a king's repose.

1112
01:25:28,337 --> 01:25:30,547
I am a king that find thee,

1113
01:25:32,007 --> 01:25:33,509
and I know...

1114
01:25:36,637 --> 01:25:39,598
'tis not the balm,
the scepter and the ball,

1115
01:25:40,474 --> 01:25:43,435
the sword, the mace,
the crown imperial,

1116
01:25:44,102 --> 01:25:47,022
the intertissued robe
of gold and pearl,

1117
01:25:47,898 --> 01:25:50,400
the farced title
running fore the king,

1118
01:25:50,859 --> 01:25:53,654
the throne he sits on...

1119
01:25:54,446 --> 01:25:56,490
nor the tide of pomp...

1120
01:25:56,907 --> 01:25:59,535
that beats upon the high shore
of this world.

1121
01:26:00,410 --> 01:26:04,289
No, not all these,
thrice-gorgeous ceremony,

1122
01:26:05,749 --> 01:26:08,544
not all these,
laid in bed majestical,

1123
01:26:09,253 --> 01:26:12,297
can sleep so soundly...

1124
01:26:13,465 --> 01:26:15,384
as the wretched slave,

1125
01:26:16,677 --> 01:26:20,097
Who, with a body filled and
vacant mind, gets him to rest,

1126
01:26:21,223 --> 01:26:23,392
crammed with
distressful bread,

1127
01:26:23,559 --> 01:26:26,395
never sees horrid night,
the child of hell,

1128
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:28,605
but like a lackey,
from the rise to the set...

1129
01:26:28,981 --> 01:26:30,774
sweats in the eye
of Phoebus...

1130
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:34,319
and all night sleeps...

1131
01:26:34,653 --> 01:26:36,280
in Elysium.

1132
01:26:37,614 --> 01:26:40,742
Next day after dawn, doth rise
and help Hyperion to his horse...

1133
01:26:41,326 --> 01:26:44,121
and follows so
the ever-running year...

1134
01:26:44,246 --> 01:26:46,331
with profitable labor
to his grave.

1135
01:26:47,416 --> 01:26:51,461
And but for ceremony...

1136
01:26:53,797 --> 01:26:55,299
such a wretch,

1137
01:26:55,883 --> 01:26:57,926
winding up days of toil...

1138
01:26:58,427 --> 01:27:00,596
and nights with sleep...

1139
01:27:03,182 --> 01:27:06,059
had the forehand
and vantage...

1140
01:27:09,313 --> 01:27:10,564
of a king.

1141
01:27:15,027 --> 01:27:18,113
My lord, your nobles,
jealous of your absence,

1142
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:20,365
seek through the camp
to find you.

1143
01:27:23,327 --> 01:27:24,620
Good old knight,

1144
01:27:25,787 --> 01:27:27,706
Collect them all together
at my tent.

1145
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:30,709
I'll be before thee.

1146
01:27:35,839 --> 01:27:38,550
O God of battles,
steel my soldiers' hearts.

1147
01:27:38,967 --> 01:27:40,594
Possess them not with fear.

1148
01:27:40,928 --> 01:27:43,013
Take from them now
their sense of reckoning...

1149
01:27:43,222 --> 01:27:45,682
if the opposed numbers
pluck their hearts from them.

1150
01:27:46,266 --> 01:27:49,144
Not today, o God,
oh, not today.

1151
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:53,315
Think not upon the fault my
father made encompassing the crown.

1152
01:27:53,815 --> 01:27:56,068
I Richard's body
have interred new...

1153
01:27:56,235 --> 01:27:58,779
and on it have bestowed
more contrite tears...

1154
01:27:58,946 --> 01:28:01,198
than from it issued
forced drops of blood.

1155
01:28:01,573 --> 01:28:04,368
Five hundred poor
I have in yearly pay...

1156
01:28:04,493 --> 01:28:06,203
who twice a day
their withered hands...

1157
01:28:06,370 --> 01:28:08,539
hold up toward heaven
to pardon blood.

1158
01:28:08,789 --> 01:28:11,375
And I have built
two chantries...

1159
01:28:11,625 --> 01:28:15,128
where the sad and solemn priests
sing still for Richard's soul.

1160
01:28:15,629 --> 01:28:17,381
More will I do...

1161
01:28:18,382 --> 01:28:20,968
though all that I can do...

1162
01:28:22,386 --> 01:28:23,762
is nothing worth...

1163
01:28:24,596 --> 01:28:27,391
since my penitence comes,
after all,

1164
01:28:28,308 --> 01:28:31,103
imploring pardon.

1165
01:28:33,856 --> 01:28:36,441
[Man] My liege!
My brother Gloucester's voice.

1166
01:28:37,901 --> 01:28:39,778
I know thy errand.

1167
01:28:41,154 --> 01:28:43,115
I will go with thee.

1168
01:28:45,158 --> 01:28:48,579
The day, my friends,

1169
01:28:49,997 --> 01:28:52,791
and all things...

1170
01:28:53,834 --> 01:28:55,169
stay...

1171
01:28:56,753 --> 01:28:58,088
for me.

1172
01:29:09,933 --> 01:29:11,518
[Drums beating]

1173
01:29:18,942 --> 01:29:22,321
Hark how our steeds
for present service neigh.

1174
01:29:23,488 --> 01:29:26,408
Mount them and make incision
in their hides...

1175
01:29:26,575 --> 01:29:29,369
that their hot blood
may spin in English eyes.

1176
01:29:30,329 --> 01:29:33,290
Do but behold
yon poor and starved band.

1177
01:29:34,166 --> 01:29:36,710
Your fair show shall
suck away their souls,

1178
01:29:37,002 --> 01:29:39,296
leaving them but
the shales and husks of men.

1179
01:29:40,339 --> 01:29:42,466
There is not work enough
for all our hands.

1180
01:29:43,342 --> 01:29:45,302
Why do you stay so long,
my lords of france?

1181
01:29:46,136 --> 01:29:49,723
Yon island carrions, desperate of their
bones, ill-favoredly become the morning field.

1182
01:29:50,641 --> 01:29:53,644
They have said their prayers,
and they stay for death.

1183
01:29:55,812 --> 01:29:59,316
A very little little let us do,
and all is done.

1184
01:30:00,526 --> 01:30:03,862
Then let the trumpets sound the
tucket sonance and the note to mount...

1185
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:07,533
for our approach will
so much dare the field...

1186
01:30:08,575 --> 01:30:12,329
that England shall crouch down
in fear... and yield!

1187
01:30:18,794 --> 01:30:20,546
[Chattering]

1188
01:30:28,262 --> 01:30:29,680
Where is the king?

1189
01:30:30,013 --> 01:30:32,224
The king himself has rode
to view their battle.

1190
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:44,444
Of fighting men,
they have full threescore thousand.

1191
01:30:45,737 --> 01:30:50,158
That's five to one.
Besides, they are all fresh.

1192
01:30:51,243 --> 01:30:52,744
'Tis a fearful odds.

1193
01:30:53,287 --> 01:30:58,375
Oh, that we now had here but one ten
thousand of those men in England...

1194
01:30:58,750 --> 01:31:00,085
That do no work today.

1195
01:31:00,711 --> 01:31:04,590
What's he that wishes so?
My cousin Westmoreland?

1196
01:31:08,969 --> 01:31:10,762
No, my fair cousin.

1197
01:31:11,847 --> 01:31:16,268
If we are marked to die, we are
enough to do our country loss.

1198
01:31:17,144 --> 01:31:19,730
And if to live,
the fewer men,

1199
01:31:20,314 --> 01:31:22,524
The greater share of honor.

1200
01:31:23,567 --> 01:31:27,321
God's will, I pray thee,
wish not one man more.

1201
01:31:29,865 --> 01:31:33,076
Rather, proclaim it,
Westmoreland, through my host,

1202
01:31:33,702 --> 01:31:35,996
that he which hath
no stomach to this fight...

1203
01:31:36,788 --> 01:31:38,207
let him depart.

1204
01:31:39,458 --> 01:31:41,293
His passport shall be made...

1205
01:31:41,502 --> 01:31:44,004
and crowns for convoy
put into his purse.

1206
01:31:44,963 --> 01:31:47,341
We would not die
in that man's company...

1207
01:31:47,424 --> 01:31:50,052
that fears his fellowship
to die with us.

1208
01:31:52,054 --> 01:31:54,681
This day is called
the feast of Crispian.

1209
01:31:56,308 --> 01:32:00,270
He that outlives this day
and comes safe home...

1210
01:32:00,312 --> 01:32:03,357
will stand at tiptoe
when this day is named...

1211
01:32:03,982 --> 01:32:06,318
and rouse him
at the name of Crispian.

1212
01:32:06,985 --> 01:32:09,446
He that shall see this day
and live old age...

1213
01:32:09,863 --> 01:32:12,908
will yearly, on the vigil,
feast his neighbors...

1214
01:32:13,116 --> 01:32:15,994
and say, "tomorrow
is Saint Crispin's."

1215
01:32:17,287 --> 01:32:19,665
Then will he strip his sleeve
and show his scars...

1216
01:32:19,873 --> 01:32:24,336
and say, "these wounds
I had on Crispin's day."

1217
01:32:27,047 --> 01:32:28,632
Old men forget,

1218
01:32:29,633 --> 01:32:33,011
yet all shall be forgot but
he'll remember with advantages...

1219
01:32:33,262 --> 01:32:35,222
what feats he did that day.

1220
01:32:35,681 --> 01:32:39,518
Then shall our names, familiar
in their mouths as household words...

1221
01:32:39,810 --> 01:32:41,979
Harry the king,
Bedford and Exeter,

1222
01:32:42,354 --> 01:32:44,648
Warwick and Talbot,
Salisbury and Gloucester...

1223
01:32:44,815 --> 01:32:47,985
be in their flowing cups
freshly remembered.

1224
01:32:48,527 --> 01:32:51,405
This story shall
a good man teach his son.

1225
01:32:52,281 --> 01:32:54,992
Crispin Crispian
shall ne'er go by,

1226
01:32:55,367 --> 01:32:58,662
from this day to
the ending of the world,

1227
01:32:59,872 --> 01:33:02,374
but we in it
shall be remembered.

1228
01:33:03,542 --> 01:33:05,252
We few,

1229
01:33:08,547 --> 01:33:10,841
we happy few,

we band of brothers.

1231
01:33:13,427 --> 01:33:16,430
For he today that sheds his
blood with me shall be my brother.

1232
01:33:17,181 --> 01:33:20,475
Be he ne'er so vile,
this day shall gentle his condition.

1233
01:33:21,185 --> 01:33:23,604
And gentlemen in England
now abed...

1234
01:33:23,854 --> 01:33:27,274
shall think themselves accursed
they were not here...

1235
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:30,194
and hold their manhoods cheap...

1236

whiles any speaks
that fought with us...

1237

in their battle set...

1241
01:33:48,337 --> 01:33:51,048
and will with all expedience
march upon us!

1242
01:33:51,423 --> 01:33:54,384
All things are ready
if our minds be so!

1243
01:33:54,968 --> 01:33:57,054
Perish the man whose mind
is backward now.

1244
01:33:57,346 --> 01:33:59,556
Thou dost not wish more help
from England, coz?

1245
01:33:59,932 --> 01:34:01,642
God's will, my liege.

1246
01:34:01,934 --> 01:34:05,229
You and I alone, without more help,
could fight this royal battle.

1247
01:34:06,730 --> 01:34:07,981
You know your places!

of thee, if for they ransom,

1250
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:24,998
thou wilt now compound before
thy most assured overthrow.

1251
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:29,336
Who hast sent thee now?
The constable of France.

1252
01:34:29,795 --> 01:34:33,090
I pray thee bear
my former answer back.

1253
01:34:33,757 --> 01:34:37,761
Bid them achieve me
and then sell my bones!

1254
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:42,015
Good god, why should they
mock poor fellows thus?

Let me speak proudly.

in the painful field,

but by the mass,
our hearts are in the trim.

save thou thy labor.

1261

Come thou no more for ransom,
gentle herald.

1262
01:35:05,998 --> 01:35:08,917
They shall have none,
I swear,

1263
01:35:09,626 --> 01:35:12,629
but these my joints!
[Cheering]

as I shall leave of them,

1265
01:35:17,801 --> 01:35:20,721
shall yield them little.

1266

1267
01:35:26,310 --> 01:35:27,686
I shall, king Harry.

1268
01:35:29,313 --> 01:35:31,106
And so fare thee well.

1269

Thou never shalt
hear herald anymore.

most humbly on my knee,

I beg the leading
of the vaward.

and of all other men...

1404

Come.

Go we in procession
to the village...

1408
01:53:44,783 --> 01:53:48,161
and be it death proclaimed
through our host...

1409
01:53:48,328 --> 01:53:49,746
to boast of this...

1410
01:53:49,955 --> 01:53:52,833
or take that praise
from God which is his only.

1411
01:53:54,543 --> 01:53:56,712
Is it not lawful,
an't please your majesty,

1412
01:53:56,962 --> 01:53:58,547
to tell how many
is killed?

1413
01:53:59,464 --> 01:54:00,841
Aye, captain,

1414
01:54:01,258 --> 01:54:02,759
but with this acknowledgement:

1415
01:54:04,052 --> 01:54:06,096
That God fought...

1416
01:54:10,976 --> 01:54:12,311
for us.

1417
01:54:15,063 --> 01:54:16,315
Yes, my conscience.

01:54:18,275 --> 01:54:20,444
He did us great good.

1419
01:54:23,697 --> 01:54:25,949
Do we all holy rites.

1420
01:54:27,117 --> 01:54:29,786
Let there be sung
non nobisandte deum.

1421
01:54:31,121 --> 01:54:33,540
The dead with charity
enclosed in clay.

1422
01:54:34,791 --> 01:54:36,335
And then to Calais...

1423
01:54:37,377 --> 01:54:38,962
and to England then,

1424
01:54:41,256 --> 01:54:44,092
where ne'er from
France arrived...

Unto our brother France,
health and fair time of day.

1465
01:59:35,717 --> 01:59:38,929
Joy and good wishes to our most fair
and princely cousin Katherine.

1466
01:59:39,513 --> 01:59:41,682
And as a branch and member
of this royalty...

1467
01:59:41,849 --> 01:59:43,851
by whom this great assembly
is contrived,

1468
01:59:44,101 --> 01:59:45,978
we do salute you,
duke of Burgundy.

1469
01:59:46,436 --> 01:59:49,231
And, princes French and peers,

1470
01:59:49,982 --> 01:59:52,025
health to you all.

1471
01:59:54,319 --> 01:59:59,449
Right joyous are we to behold your
face, most worthy brother England.

1472
02:00:00,284 --> 02:00:01,535
Fairly met.

1473
02:00:03,245 --> 02:00:06,290
So are you,
princes English, every one.

1474
02:00:16,425 --> 02:00:19,553
My duty to you both,
on equal love,

1475
02:00:21,013 --> 02:00:22,514
great kings of France...

1476
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:24,850
and England.

1477
02:00:29,229 --> 02:00:32,566
Since that my office
hath so far prevailed,

1478
02:00:33,567 --> 02:00:36,862
that face to face and royal
eye to eye you have congreeted...

1479
02:00:37,738 --> 02:00:41,658
let it not disgrace me if I
demand before this royal view...

1480
02:00:42,201 --> 02:00:45,162
why that the naked,
poor and mangled peace...

1481
02:00:45,370 --> 02:00:48,415
should not in this best
garden of the world,

1482
02:00:48,790 --> 02:00:52,336
our fertile France,
put up her lovely visage?

1483
02:00:54,505 --> 02:00:55,506
Alas,

1484
02:00:56,465 --> 02:00:58,926
she hath from France
too long been chased,

1485
02:00:59,801 --> 02:01:02,429
and all her husbandry
doth lie on heaps,

1486
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:06,433
corrupting in
its own fertility.

1487
02:01:08,310 --> 02:01:11,688
And as our vineyards,
fallows, meads and hedges,

1488
02:01:12,231 --> 02:01:14,608
defective in their natures,
grow to wildness,

1489
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:19,821
even so our houses and ourselves,
our children have lost...

1490
02:01:20,656 --> 02:01:22,574
or do not learn
for want of time...

1491
02:01:22,991 --> 02:01:25,410
those sciences which
should become our country,

1492
02:01:25,869 --> 02:01:30,123
but grow like savages,
as soldiers will...

1493
02:01:30,749 --> 02:01:33,293
that nothing do
but meditate on blood...

1494
02:01:33,877 --> 02:01:38,006
to swearing and stern looks,
diffused attire,

1495
02:01:38,882 --> 02:01:41,218
and everything that seems...

1496
02:01:42,803 --> 02:01:44,638
unnatural.

1497
02:01:46,431 --> 02:01:49,601
And my speech entreats
that I may know...

1498
02:01:49,810 --> 02:01:52,104
the let why gentle peace...

1499
02:01:52,145 --> 02:01:54,606
should not expel
these inconveniences...

1500
02:01:55,065 --> 02:01:59,570
and bless us with
her former qualities.

1501
02:02:02,656 --> 02:02:06,326
Lf, duke of Burgundy,
you would the peace...

1502
02:02:06,451 --> 02:02:09,621
whose want gives growth to the
imperfections which you have cited,

1503
02:02:09,913 --> 02:02:11,874
then you must buy
that peace...

1504
02:02:12,040 --> 02:02:16,295
with full accord
to all our just demands.

1505
02:02:16,795 --> 02:02:20,757
I have but with
a cursorary eye...

1506
02:02:21,758 --> 02:02:23,844
o'erglanced the articles.

1507
02:02:24,678 --> 02:02:27,806
Pleaseth your grace to appoint
some of your council...

1508
02:02:28,182 --> 02:02:29,850
to sit with us once more...

1509
02:02:30,934 --> 02:02:33,645
we will suddenly pass...

1510
02:02:33,854 --> 02:02:36,315
our accept
and peremptory answer.

1511
02:02:37,774 --> 02:02:39,026
Brother, we shall.

1512
02:02:41,695 --> 02:02:44,281
Yet leave
our cousin Katherine...

1513
02:02:44,865 --> 02:02:46,200
here with us.

1514
02:02:48,994 --> 02:02:51,580
She is our capital demand...

1515
02:02:52,623 --> 02:02:55,292
comprised within
the fore-rank of our articles.

1516
02:03:01,924 --> 02:03:03,425
She hath good leave.

1517
02:03:21,860 --> 02:03:24,196
Fair Katherine,
and most fair,

1518
02:03:24,488 --> 02:03:26,448
will you vouchsafe
to teach a soldier...

1519
02:03:26,698 --> 02:03:29,034
terms such as will enter
at a lady's ear...

1520
02:03:29,201 --> 02:03:32,204
and plead his love suit
to her gentle heart?

1521
02:03:33,789 --> 02:03:36,124
Your majesty
shall mock at me.

1522
02:03:37,042 --> 02:03:39,336
I cannot speak your England.

1523
02:03:40,379 --> 02:03:41,755
Oh.

1524
02:03:44,758 --> 02:03:47,845
Fair Katherine, if you will love me
soundly with your French heart,

1525
02:03:48,387 --> 02:03:51,682
glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English

1526
02:03:52,099 --> 02:03:53,892
Do you like me, Kate?

1527
02:03:54,685 --> 02:03:58,146
Pardonnez-moi. I cannot
tell what is "like me."

1528
02:03:59,773 --> 02:04:01,733
An angel is like you, Kate,
and you are like an angel.

1529
02:04:03,151 --> 02:04:05,070
Que dit-il? Que je suis
semblable a les anges?

1530
02:04:05,279 --> 02:04:07,865
Qui, vraiment, sauf votre
grace, ainsi dit-il.

1531
02:04:08,740 --> 02:04:10,325
[Sighs]
Mon dieu.

1532
02:04:11,285 --> 02:04:14,204
Les langues des hommes
sont pleines de tromperies.

1533
02:04:14,621 --> 02:04:15,956
What says she, fair one?

1534
02:04:16,123 --> 02:04:20,169
That the tongues of men
are full of deceits?

1535
02:04:20,752 --> 02:04:25,048
Oui. That the tongues of
the mens is be full of deceits.

1536
02:04:25,757 --> 02:04:27,259
That is the princess.

1537
02:04:29,803 --> 02:04:31,972
I'faith, my wooing is fit
for thy understanding.

1538
02:04:32,848 --> 02:04:36,727
I know no ways to mince it in love,
but directly to say, "I love you."

1539
02:04:37,227 --> 02:04:40,439
Then, if you urge me farther than to say,
"Do you in faith?" I wear out my suit.

1540
02:04:40,981 --> 02:04:44,484
Give me your answer... i'faith do... and so
clap hands and a bargain. How say you, lady?

1541
02:04:46,278 --> 02:04:48,238
Sauf votre honneur,
me understand well.

1542
02:04:49,656 --> 02:04:52,910
Marry, if you would put me to verses or
to dance for your sake, why, you undid me.

1543
02:04:53,827 --> 02:04:56,205
If I could win a lady at leapfrog
or by vaulting into my saddle...

1544
02:04:56,330 --> 02:04:58,665
with my arm around my back,
I should quickly leap into a wife.

1545
02:04:58,832 --> 02:05:01,585
I could lay on like a butcher and
sit like a jackanapes, never off.

1546
02:05:02,294 --> 02:05:04,922
But before God, Kate,
I cannot look greenly...

1547
02:05:05,506 --> 02:05:09,885
Nor gasp out my eloquence nor
I have no cunning in protestation.

1548
02:05:12,221 --> 02:05:13,931
If thou canst love a fellow
of this temper, Kate,

1549
02:05:14,181 --> 02:05:16,683
that never looks in his glass
for love of anything he sees there,

1550
02:05:16,892 --> 02:05:18,393
let thine eye be thy cook.

1551
02:05:19,603 --> 02:05:23,148
I speak to thee plain soldier. If thou
canst love me for this, take me.

1552
02:05:23,774 --> 02:05:26,443
If not, to say to thee
that I shall die, 'tis true,

1553
02:05:26,652 --> 02:05:28,195
but for thy love,
by the lord, no.

1554
02:05:28,820 --> 02:05:30,572
Yet I love thee too.

1555
02:05:31,240 --> 02:05:34,368
If thou would have
such a one, take me.

1556
02:05:34,993 --> 02:05:37,538
And take me, take a soldier.

1557
02:05:38,789 --> 02:05:41,542
Take a soldier, take a king.

1558
02:05:43,752 --> 02:05:45,754
And what sayest thou
then to my love?

1559
02:05:46,380 --> 02:05:47,631
Speak, my fair,

1560
02:05:47,881 --> 02:05:50,634
and fairly, too, I pray thee.

1561
02:05:52,135 --> 02:05:55,556
Is it possible that I should
love the enemy of France?

1562
02:05:57,140 --> 02:05:58,600
No, kate.

1563
02:05:59,393 --> 02:06:02,187
It is not possible that you
should love the enemy of France.

1564
02:06:03,981 --> 02:06:06,608
But in loving me, you should
love the friend of France,

1565
02:06:07,526 --> 02:06:10,404
for I love France so well that
I will not part with a village of it.

1566
02:06:11,071 --> 02:06:12,447
I will have it all mine.

1567
02:06:12,906 --> 02:06:15,367
And, Kate, when France
is mine, and I am yours,

1568
02:06:15,450 --> 02:06:17,661
then yours is France,
and you are mine.

1569
02:06:20,706 --> 02:06:22,165
I cannot tell what is that.

1570
02:06:23,375 --> 02:06:24,501
No, kate?

1571
02:06:26,503 --> 02:06:29,548
I will tell thee in French...

1572
02:06:30,591 --> 02:06:32,342
which I am sure will
hang about my tongue...

1573
02:06:32,551 --> 02:06:35,929
like a new-married wife
about her husband's neck, //hardly to be shook off.

02:06:48,192 --> 02:06:49,735

et, uh, vous etes mienne.

1581
02:07:03,957 --> 02:07:05,918
It is as easy for me, Kate,
to conquer the kingdom...

1582
02:07:06,001 --> 02:07:07,711
as to speak so much more French!

1583
02:07:07,961 --> 02:07:10,297
I will never move thee in French
unless it be to laugh at me.

1584
02:07:13,467 --> 02:07:17,262
Sauf votre honneur,
le francais que vous parlez...

1585
02:07:17,387 --> 02:07:19,932
Il est meilleur
que I'anglais lequel je parle.

1586
02:07:21,767 --> 02:07:23,519
No, faith, it is not.

1587
02:07:24,228 --> 02:07:25,395
But tell me, Kate,

1588
02:07:26,396 --> 02:07:29,149
Canst thou understand
thus much English?

1589
02:07:30,984 --> 02:07:34,655
Canst thou love me?

1590
02:07:38,242 --> 02:07:39,409
I cannot tell.

1591
02:07:39,701 --> 02:07:41,578
Well, can any of your neighbors
tell, Kate? I'll ask them.

1592
02:07:43,163 --> 02:07:45,249
By mine honor, in true English,
I swear I love thee,

1593
02:07:45,666 --> 02:07:47,751
by which honor I dare
not swear thou lovest me.

1594
02:07:48,001 --> 02:07:52,464
Yet my blood begins to flatter
me that thou dost...

1595
02:07:52,881 --> 02:07:56,593
withstanding the poor and untempering effect of my vis

1596
02:07:56,760 --> 02:07:59,012
Now beshrew
my father's ambition!

1597
02:07:59,137 --> 02:08:01,014
He was thinking of
civil wars when he got me.

1598
02:08:01,223 --> 02:08:03,725
Therefore was I created
with a stubborn outside,

1599
02:08:03,934 --> 02:08:06,979
with an aspect of iron, that
when I come to woo ladies,

1600
02:08:07,354 --> 02:08:08,730
I fright them.

1601
02:08:10,357 --> 02:08:13,318
But, in faith, kate, the elder I wax,
the better I shall appear.

1602
02:08:13,819 --> 02:08:17,948
My comfort is that old age,
that ill layer-up of beauty,

1603
02:08:18,198 --> 02:08:21,034
can do no more spoil
upon my face.

1604
02:08:21,743 --> 02:08:25,122
Thou hast me... ifthou
hast me... at the worst.

1605
02:08:26,373 --> 02:08:29,042
And thou shalt wear me...
if thou wear me...

1606
02:08:29,668 --> 02:08:31,378
Better and better.

1607
02:08:31,962 --> 02:08:34,298
And, therefore, tell me,
most fair Katherine,

1608
02:08:35,716 --> 02:08:37,551
Will you have me?

1609
02:08:39,052 --> 02:08:41,013
Come, your answer
in broken music,

1610
02:08:41,096 --> 02:08:43,140
for thy voice is music,

1611
02:08:43,807 --> 02:08:46,143
and thy English, broken.

1612
02:08:47,477 --> 02:08:49,605
Therefore, queen of all,
Katherine,

1613
02:08:50,647 --> 02:08:52,608
wilt thou have me?

1614
02:08:55,485 --> 02:08:57,571
That is as it shall please
le roi mon pere.

1615
02:09:00,115 --> 02:09:02,242
Nay, it shall
please him well, Kate.

1616
02:09:03,327 --> 02:09:05,204
It shall please him, Kate.

1617
02:09:07,706 --> 02:09:10,083
Then it shall also content me.

1618
02:09:14,046 --> 02:09:19,176
Upon that, I kiss your hand,
and I call you my queen.

1619
02:09:19,927 --> 02:09:21,720
Laissez, mon seigneur,
laissez, laissez.

1620
02:09:22,346 --> 02:09:25,015
Ma foi, je ne veux point que
vous abaissiez votre grandeur...

1621
02:09:25,224 --> 02:09:28,101
En baisant la main d'une de
votre seigneurie indigne serviteur.

1622
02:09:29,269 --> 02:09:32,731
Excusez-moi, je vous supplie,
mon tres-puissant seigneur.

1623
02:09:33,732 --> 02:09:35,400
Then I will kiss
your lips, Kate.

1624
02:09:35,734 --> 02:09:38,862
Les dames et demoiselles pour
etre baisees devant leur noces...

1625
02:09:39,029 --> 02:09:40,322
Il n'est pas
la coutume de France.

1626
02:09:41,281 --> 02:09:42,991
Madame my interpreter,
what says she?

1627
02:09:43,075 --> 02:09:45,452
That is not be the fashion
for the ladies of France...

1628

Oh, I cannot tell

1629
02:09:49,831 --> 02:09:51,291

Your majestyentends
betterque moi.

1631
02:09:54,711 --> 02:09:58,674
Ah, it is not a fashion for the maids in
France to kiss before they are married?

1632
02:09:59,925 --> 02:10:01,718
Oui, vraiment.

1633
02:10:02,094 --> 02:10:03,303
Oh, kate.

1634
02:10:04,263 --> 02:10:06,265
Nice customs curtsy
to great kings.

1635
02:10:06,765 --> 02:10:10,143
You and I cannot be confined within
the weak list of a country's fashion.

1636
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:15,232
We... are the makers
of manners, Kate.

1637
02:10:16,942 --> 02:10:18,235
Therefore, patiently...

1638
02:10:19,152 --> 02:10:20,529
and yielding.

1639
02:10:31,373 --> 02:10:34,376
You have witchcraft
in your lips, Kate.

1640
02:10:36,170 --> 02:10:38,755
There is more eloquence
in a sugar touch of them...

than in the tongues
of the French council.

[Thudding]
Here comes your father.

1643

God save
your majesty.

1644
02:10:52,978 --> 02:10:54,271

teach you
our princess english?

1646
02:10:58,650 --> 02:11:01,153
I would have her learn,
my fair cousin,

1647
02:11:01,403 --> 02:11:04,698
how perfectly I love her,

We have consented
to all terms of reason.

1651
02:11:50,118 --> 02:11:53,205
And thereupon
give me your daughter.

1652

Take her, fair son,

1653
02:12:00,087 --> 02:12:03,966
and from her blood
raise up issue to me...

1654
02:12:05,008 --> 02:12:08,345
that the contending kingdoms
of France and England...

1655

envy of each other's happiness...

in their sweet bosoms...

That here I kiss her
as my sovereign queen.

1666

of all marriages,

combine our hearts in one,
our realms in one.

or fell jealousy...

which troubles oft
the bed of blessed marriage...

of their incorporate league...

1674

that English may as French,

did this king succeed...
