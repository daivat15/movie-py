Um-

168
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,894
I just wanted to tell you that...

169
00:19:43,962 --> 00:19:47,728
I practiced the coda last night,
and... I finished.

170
00:19:52,971 --> 00:19:54,905
I thought you should know.

171
00:19:54,973 --> 00:19:58,534
Okay, Nina, listen. Honestly,
I don't care about your technique.

172
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,272
- You should know that by now.
- Yeah, but yesterday-

173
00:20:01,346 --> 00:20:04,281
No. Anyway,
I’ve already chosen Veronica.

174
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:05,475
So-

175
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:08,111
Sorry.

176
00:20:08,921 --> 00:20:10,650
Okay. Thank you.

177
00:20:13,158 --> 00:20:16,559
That's it? You're not gonna try
and change my mind?

178
00:20:17,729 --> 00:20:19,663
You must have thought it was possible.

179
00:20:19,731 --> 00:20:23,497
Otherwise, what are you
doing here all dolled up?

180
00:20:25,204 --> 00:20:27,604
I came to ask for the part.

181
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:33,610
Well...

182
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,306
the truth is...

183
00:20:36,248 --> 00:20:38,409
when I look at you...

184
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:40,509
all I see is the white swan.

185
00:20:40,586 --> 00:20:44,352
Yes, you're beautiful, fearful, fragile.

186
00:20:44,423 --> 00:20:45,651
Ideal casting.

187
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:51,660
But the black swan?
It’s a hard fucking job to dance both.

188
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,527
I can dance the black swan too.

189
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:55,089
Really?

190
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:58,262
In four years, every time you dance...

191
00:20:58,337 --> 00:21:00,817
I see you obsess getting
each and every move perfectly right...

192
00:21:00,873 --> 00:21:03,501
but I never see you lose yourself.

193
00:21:03,575 --> 00:21:05,566
Ever.

194
00:21:05,644 --> 00:21:07,612
All that discipline for what?

195
00:21:10,883 --> 00:21:13,443
- I just want to be perfect.
- You what?

196
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:15,214
I want to be perfect.

197
00:21:18,157 --> 00:21:20,887
Perfection is not just about control.

198
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:24,318
It’s also about letting go.

199
00:21:24,396 --> 00:21:27,456
Surprise yourself,
so you can surprise the audience.

200
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:29,501
Transcendence.

201
00:21:29,568 --> 00:21:31,798
And very few have it in them.

202
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,861
I think I do have it in-

203
00:21:40,812 --> 00:21:42,040
You bit me?

204
00:21:43,415 --> 00:21:45,747
I can-I can't believe you bit me.

205
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:48,047
I’m sorry.

206
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,111
Now, that fucking hurt.

207
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:54,688
- You were great.
- Thanks.

208
00:21:56,061 --> 00:21:59,155
Yeah. Really. No.

209
00:22:01,466 --> 00:22:03,331
Yeah.

210
00:22:05,837 --> 00:22:09,136
What? Why is she always staring at me?

211
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,699
She's obsessed with you.

212
00:22:11,777 --> 00:22:13,802
Hey. It’s been posted.

- Um-
- What is it?

231
00:23:44,436 --> 00:23:46,370
He picked me, Mommy.

00:23:49,174 --> 00:23:51,369
- Did you hear me?
- For Swan Lake?

233
00:23:51,443 --> 00:23:54,503

495
00:49:17,234 --> 00:49:19,202
That was me seducing you...

496
00:49:19,269 --> 00:49:22,136
when it needs to be
the other way around.

497

Please.

498
00:49:45,929 --> 00:49:47,726
Who is that?

499
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:50,032
Hey.

500
00:49:51,869 --> 00:49:53,700
You okay?

501
00:49:55,005 --> 00:49:57,269
You can't smoke in here.

502
00:49:57,341 --> 00:50:00,469
Well, I won't tell if you won't.

503
00:50:03,146 --> 00:50:04,443
So...

504
00:50:04,514 --> 00:50:07,108
big day's getting closer and closer, huh?

505
00:50:09,152 --> 00:50:13,248
Well, I can't wait.
I think you're gonna be amazing.

506
00:50:14,691 --> 00:50:16,124
Thanks.

507
00:50:20,597 --> 00:50:21,894
Come on.

508
00:50:30,641 --> 00:50:31,801
So...

509
00:50:32,876 --> 00:50:34,935
do you want to talk about it?

510
00:50:36,246 --> 00:50:38,544
I just had a hard day.

511
00:50:39,716 --> 00:50:42,981
Oh. Leroy playing
a little too rough for you?

512
00:50:43,053 --> 00:50:44,884
Come on, Nina. He's a prick.

513
00:50:44,955 --> 00:50:47,150
He's brilliant.

514
00:50:47,224 --> 00:50:50,421
Sure. But it's not like
he's all warm and fuzzy.

515
00:50:52,162 --> 00:50:53,959
Well, you don't know him.

516
00:50:56,533 --> 00:50:58,660
Someone's hot for teacher.

517
00:51:00,237 --> 00:51:02,671
Oh. Come on. It’s okay.
I don't blame you.

518
00:51:02,739 --> 00:51:05,333
- I should go home.
- Oh, Nina, come on.

519
00:51:05,409 --> 00:51:07,468

Excuse me, Your Highness.

He has a reputation.

I have a right to be concerned, Nina.

You've been staying late
so many nights rehearsing.

I hope he isn't taking advantage.

Thanks.

Not like that. I just mean as far
as my career was concerned.

What career?

563

The one I gave up to have you.

It’s fine.

Hey.

What are you doing here?

583
00:57:38,501 --> 00:57:42,096
I just came by to apologize. You're right. I
should have never spoken to him about you.

584
00:57:42,172 --> 00:57:43,867
- Sweetheart?
- Give me a second.

585
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:45,237
- Your dinner.
- Mom, please!

586
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:49,075
Wow, she's a trip.

587
00:57:49,145 --> 00:57:51,773
How do you know where I live?

588
00:57:51,848 --> 00:57:54,408
I have my ways.

589
00:57:54,484 --> 00:57:55,883
Jesus, relax.

590
00:57:55,952 --> 00:57:59,012
I got it from Susie in the office.

591
00:57:59,089 --> 00:58:02,490
I feel really shitty about what I did,
and I just want to make it up to you.

592
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,687
- So how about I take you out to dinner?
- I don't think-

593
00:58:05,762 --> 00:58:09,596
Okay, that's fine.
What about, um, drinks?

594
00:58:10,734 --> 00:58:12,668
Sweetie, you need to rest.

595
00:58:12,736 --> 00:58:14,727
- Jesus.
- Wait.

596
00:58:15,772 --> 00:58:17,831
What are you doing?

597
00:58:17,907 --> 00:58:19,465
- Going out.
- What?

598
00:58:19,542 --> 00:58:20,975
- Stairs.
- Nina!

599
00:58:21,044 --> 00:58:23,569
You're on the stage tomorrow!

600
00:58:24,848 --> 00:58:27,874
I can't believe he calls her that.
It’s so gross.

601
00:58:27,951 --> 00:58:29,179
I think it's sweet.

602
00:58:29,252 --> 00:58:32,585
"Little princess"?
He probably calls every girl that.

603
00:58:32,655 --> 00:58:34,919
No way. That's just for Beth.

604
00:58:36,226 --> 00:58:39,559
I bet he'll be calling you
"little princess" any day now.

605
00:58:39,629 --> 00:58:41,722
I don't know about that.

606
00:58:41,798 --> 00:58:44,767
Oh, sure, he will.
You just gotta let him lick your pussy.

607
00:58:46,202 --> 00:58:48,261
Cheeseburger, extra bloody.

608
00:58:48,338 --> 00:58:50,203
Mmm! Danke schön.

609
00:58:51,541 --> 00:58:53,566

juicy enough for you.

Mmm.

616

Wanna spruce up?

617
00:59:24,974 --> 00:59:27,306
What? I carry a spare.

618
00:59:28,344 --> 00:59:31,142
In case I wake up
somewhere unexpected.

619
00:59:33,917 --> 00:59:36,818
So, how is he?

620
00:59:38,221 --> 00:59:40,314
Thomas.

621
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:42,290
I wouldn't know.

622
00:59:42,358 --> 00:59:45,452
