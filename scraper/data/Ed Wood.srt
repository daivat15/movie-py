1
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,596
Greetings, my friend.

2
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:50,051
You are interested in the unknown,

3
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,683
the mysterious, the unexplainable.

4
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,686
That is why you are here.

5
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,938
And now, for the first time,

6
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,647
we are bringing you the full story
of what happened.

7
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,278
We are giving you all the evidence

8
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:08,827
based only on the secret testimony
of the miserable souls

9
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,406
who survived this terrifying ordeal.

10
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,413
The incidents, places.

11
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,996
My friend, we cannot keep this
a secret any longer.

12
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:22,087
Can your heart stand the shocking facts

13
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,133
of the true story

14
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,338
of Edward D. Wood, Jr.?

15
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:16,157
It's 8:15.
We can't hold the curtain any longer.

16
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:19,407
Cripes, what am I gonna tell the cast?
It's press night and there's no press!

17
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,999
- Do you believe in ghosts?
- Nah, Tommy.

18
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,042
That's just kiddie spook stories.

19
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:30,122
Once you're dead, you stay dead.

20
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,624
I don't know, Bill.

21
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:36,129
Out on that battlefield today,
I saw this woman dressed in white

22
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,714
floating above the dunes.

23
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:43,302
Maybe it was just fatigue or maybe
it's the indignities of war.

24
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,479
Or maybe it's somethin' else.

25
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,606
Hey, I think I see somethin'.

26
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:01,620
I offer you mortals the bird of peace

27
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,323
so that you may change your ways

28
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,791
and end this destruction.

29
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,838
What a show! Everyone was terrific.

30
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,887
Paul, your second act monologue
actually gave me the chills.

31
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,214
Oh, thanks, Eddie.

32
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,057
I got the early edition,
hot off the presses!

33
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,013
This is the big moment.

34
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,406
Oh, what does that old queen know?

35
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,482
She didn't even show.

36
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,613
Sent her copy boy to do the dirty work.

37
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:50,374
- Screw you, Miss Crowley.
- Do I really have a face like a horse?

38
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,580
What does "ostentatious" mean?

39
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,256
Hey, it's not that bad. You can't
concentrate on the negative.

40
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,460
Look, he's got some
nice things to say here.

41
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,386
"The soldiers' costumes
are very realistic." That's positive!

42
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:03,807
- Rave of the century.
- Well, I've seen a lot worse reviews.

43
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,977
I've seen reviews where they didn't
even mention the costumes.

44
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,976
Like that last Francis the Mule picture.
It got terrible notices.

45
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,023
- Huge hit!
- Lines around the block.

46
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,898
That's right. Don't take it too seriously.
We're all doing great work.

47
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,230
- Do you really think so?
- Absolutely.

48
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,234
Honey, what if I'm wrong?

49
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:26,538
- What if I just don't got it?
- Ed, it was only one review.

50
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:30,243
Orson Welles was only 26
when he made Citizen Kane.

51
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,285
I'm already 30.

52
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,001
Ed, you're still young.

53
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,960
This is the time in your life when
you're supposed to be struggling.

54
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:43,218
I know. But I'm scared it's not going
to get any better than this.

55
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:49,971
Oh, I hate having to
wake up this early.

56
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,775
Gosh, where's my pink sweater?

57
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,904
I can never seem to find
my clothes anymore.

58
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:12,959
Hey, big shot! Get off your ass and get
this over to the executive building.

59
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:17,414
- Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.
- Hey, Charlie, come here.

60
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,717
What did I tell ya about watering these
plants, eh? I want some water on 'em!

61
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,420
Don't sprinkle the damn things!
Soak 'em!

62
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,098
Hi.

63
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,060
All right, people, settle.
And action!

64
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,493
Wow! Look at these camels!

65
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,495
These are real camels!

66
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,254
- Gosh, where'd they get real camels?
- Hey, you!

67
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,831
Move it outta here, huh?

68
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:09,262
Hey, Eddie! Come in here.
I got some great new stuff to show you.

69
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,612
This is fantastic.
What are you gonna do with it?

70
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,315
Probably file it away
and never see it again.

71
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,695
Ah, it's such a waste.

72
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,620
Why, if I had half the chance,

73
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,824
I could make an entire movie
using this stock footage.

74
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:40,455
The story opens on these
mysterious explosions.

75
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,587
Nobody knows what's causing them,
but it's upsetting all the buffalo.

76
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,636
So the military are called in
to solve the mystery.

77
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,509
You forgot the octopus.

78
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,091
No, no. I'm saving that
for my big underwater climax.

79
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,850
Hello.

80
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,900
They say he was a girl
trapped in a man's body.

81
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,976
- I bet it hurt when they cut his thing off.
- Ugh!

82
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,651
What are you ladies
gabbin' about?

83
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,448
You know that
Christine Jorgensen freak?

84
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,118
- It's...
- He... She... in Variety.

85
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,662
Some producer's makin' a biopic.

86
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,412
Really? I didn't read that story.

87
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,504
Yes, I've got
Mr. Edward Wood on the line.

88
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,547
Could you please hold?

89
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,220
Mr. Weiss? Ed Wood here.

90
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,922
Listen, I heard about your new project

91
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,508
and I was curious
if you'd signed a director yet.

92
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,559
Oh, you haven't!

93
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,138
Well, if we could get together,
I could explain to you

94
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:42,021
why I'm more qualified to direct
this than anyone else in town.

95
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:47,029
Well, I'd rather not
go into that over the phone.

96
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,278
All right. Great!

97
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,236
I'll see you then. Bye!

98
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,363
Eddie, I don't understand.

99
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,949
Why are you the most qualified director
for the Christine Jorgensen story?

100
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,577
Oh, it's just hogwash, hon.
I had to get into the door somehow.

101
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,646
No, I love you like a brother.

102
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:27,275
No, no, no. No, no, no.
That's a falsehood!

103
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,861
Come in!

104
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,069
Look, when I said
you could have the western territories,

105
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,325
I didn't mean all 11 states!

106
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:40,243
I meant California, Oregon,
and what's that one on top?

107
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,293
Washington, yeah, yeah!

108
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,541
Oh, really?

109
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,623
Well, screw you!

110
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,509
Hi. Can I help you?

111
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:50,585
Yes. I'm Ed Wood.

112
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,636
I'm here about directing
the Christine Jorgensen picture.

113
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,431
Well, a couple of things have changed.

114
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,884
It ain't gonna be the
Christine Jorgensen story no more.

115
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,641
Goddamn Variety had to print
the story before I got the rights.

116
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,849
- Now that bitch is asking for the sky.
- Ah, you're not gonna make the movie.

117
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,351
No, of course
I'm gonna make the picture.

118
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,233
I already presold
Alabama and Oklahoma.

119
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,486
Those repressed Okies, they go for
that twisted, perverted stuff.

120
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,493
We'll just do it without the she-male.
We'll fictionalize it.

121
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,869
- Is there a script?
- Fuck no. But, there's a poster.

122
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,332
It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.

123
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,922
Well, Mr. Weiss, look no further.
I'm your man.

124
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,922
I work fast and I'm a deal.
I write and direct. And I'm good.

125
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,298
I just did a play in Hollywood

126
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,722
and Victor Crowley himself
praised its realism.

127
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,679
There's about 500 guys in this town
that can say the same thing.

128
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,353
On the phone you said you had
some special qualifications?

129
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,652
Mr. Weiss

130
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,981
I have never told anyone

131
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,237
what I'm about to tell you.

132
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,694
But I really want this job.

133
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,329
I like to dress in women's clothing.

134
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:06,661
You're a fruit?

135
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,542
No, not at all. I love women.

136
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,621
Wearing their clothes
makes me feel closer to them.

137
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:15,004
- You're not a fruit.
- No, I'm all man. I even fought in WWII.

138
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,606
Of course, I was wearing women's
undergarments under my uniform.

139
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,100
Ya got to be kidding me.

140
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:23,394
Confidentially, I even paratrooped
wearing a brassiere and panties.

141
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,807
I tell ya, I wasn't scared of being killed,
but I was terrified of getting wounded

142
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,490
and having the medics
discover my secret.

143
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,820
So you think
this qualifies you to make my movie?

144
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,646
Yes!

145
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,733
I know what it's like
to live with a secret

146
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,776
and worry about what people
are gonna think of ya.

147
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,410
My girlfriend still doesn't know why
her sweaters are always stretched out.

148
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:48,537
Ed, you seem like a nice kid.
Look around you.

149
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:52,340
I don't hire directors with burning
desires to tell their stories.

150
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,417
<i>I make movies like Chained Girls.</i>

151
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,797
I need someone with experience

152
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,130
who can shoot a film in four days
and make me a profit.

153
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,757
I'm sorry. That's all that matters.

154
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,389
Can I get you anything else, kid?

155
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,399
Too constrictive!
I can't even fold my arms.

156
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,780
Gee, Mr. Lugosi,
I've never had any complaints.

157
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,238
This is the most uncomfortable coffin
I've ever been in.

158
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,916
Your selection is quite shoddy.
You're wasting my time!

159
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:11,874
Mr. Lugosi?

160
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,993
I told you I don't want
any of your goddamn coffins!

161
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,587
No, no! I don't work here.

162
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,761
- Then who are you? What do you want?
- I don't want anything.

163
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:23,215
I'm just a really big, big fan.
I've seen all your movies.

164
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,096
Mr. Lugosi,
why are you buying a coffin?

165
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,522
I'm planning on dying soon.

166
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,270
- No!
- Yes!

167
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,510
I'm embarking on another
bus and truck tour of Dracula.

168
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:38,442
Twelve cities in 10 days,
if that's conceivable.

169
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:42,025
Do you know that I saw you perform
Dracula in Poughkeepsie in 1938?

170
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,781
That was a terrible production.

171
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,454
- Renfield was a drunk!
- I thought it was great.

172
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:50,124
You know, you're much scarier
in real life than you are in the movie.

173
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,122
Thank you.

174
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,670
I even waited outside to get your
autograph, but you never came out.

175
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,840
Well, I apologize. When I play Dracula,
I put myself into a trance.

176
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,464
It takes me much time to reemerge.

177
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,139
Oh, there's my bus.
Shit, where is my transfer?

178
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,138
- Say, don't you have a car?
- I refuse to drive in this country.

179
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,219
Too many madmen.

180
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,481
I've got a car.

181
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:22,274
Boy, Mr. Lugosi,
you must lead such an exciting life.

182
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:26,736
- When is your next picture coming out?
- I have no next picture.

183
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,162
You gotta be jokin'.

184
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,036
A great star like you,
you must have dozens of 'em lined up.

185
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,493
Back in the old days, yes.

186
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,496
But now,
no one gives two fucks for Bela.

187
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:39,958
- But you're a big star.
- No more.

188
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,130
I haven't worked in four years.

189
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:47,804
<i>This business, this town,
it chews you up, then spits you out.</i>

190
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:52,262
I'm just an ex-bogeyman. Make a right.

191
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,949
They don't want
the classic horror films anymore.

192
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,533
Today, it's all giant bugs.

193
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,914
Giant spiders, giant grasshoppers.

194
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,791
Who would believe such nonsense?

195
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:22,758
The old ones were much spookier,
they had castles and full moons.

196
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,631
They were mythic.

197
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,213
- They had a poetry to them.
- Yes.

198
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,220
And you know what else? The women...

199
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:34,395
The women prefer
the traditional monsters.

200
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,393
The women. Huh.

201
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:40,648
The pure horror,
it both repels and attracts them.

202
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,354
Because in their
collective unconsciousness,

203
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,899
they have the agony of childbirth.

204
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:49,657
The blood... The blood is horror.

205
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,160
You know, I never thought of that.

206
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,206
Take my word for it.

207
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,834
If you want to make out
with a young lady

208
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:03,507
you take her to see Dracula.

209
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,429
Eh, what a mess.

210
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,432
My wife of 20 years left me last month.

211
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,809
I'm not much of a housekeeper.

212
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,937
All right, I'm coming.
I'll feed you, my darlings.

213
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,064
I'd better get going.

214
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:25,818
But perhaps we could get together
again some time, Mr. Lugosi.

215
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,820
Certainly.

216
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,494
But now, the children of
the night are calling me.

217
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,324
Uh...

218
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,705
- Good day.
- Good day.

219
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:45,087
Sweetie, you won't believe it.
I've got incredible news.

220
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,801
- You got the job!
- No, I didn't get the job.

221
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:51,507
- But something better happened.
- Better than not getting the job.

222
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:54,263
Yes! I met a movie star.

223
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,145
- Somebody really big.
- Who? Robert Taylor?

224
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,349
No. A horror movie star.

225
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,901
- Boris Karloff?
- Close.

226
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,023
The other one.

227
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,486
You met Basil Rathbone!

228
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,819
Oh, to heck with you.
I met Bela Lugosi.

229
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:17,408
- Why, I thought he was dead.
- No, he's very much alive.

230
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,833
Well,

231
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,034
sort of.

232
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:25,332
He's old and frail, but he's still
Bela Lugosi and he's really nice.

233
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,792
I can't even remember the last time
I saw him in a picture.

234
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,127
It's a shame.

235
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,588
He's such a great actor
and no one uses him anymore.

236
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,511
- So, did you get his autograph?
- No, it wasn't like that at all.

237
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,936
It was just the two of us and we were
talking. He treated me like a friend.

238
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,556
- Yeah, well, he's a bum.
- No, he's not.

239
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,108
Do you have any idea how much money
he made for this studio?

240
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,151
<i>Dracula, The Black Cat, The Raven.</i>

241
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,428
Yeah? Well, now he's a junkie.
He don't deserve to work.

242
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:52,442
- That is not true!
- He's so great, you hire him.

243
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,657
Yeah, well, I would if I could.

244
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,664
Trick or treat!

245
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,958
The house looks like
they have lots of kids.

246
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:29,020
<i>Ooh, those eyes.
He gives me the willies.</i>

247
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:32,073
Uh, I hate it when
she interrupts the picture.

248
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:35,072
She doesn't show 'em
the proper respect.

249
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,119
I think she's a honey.

250
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,581
Look at those jugs.

251
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,205
<i>But he stood me up at the restaurant.</i>

252
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,457
<i>I guess I shouldn't have
picked a steak house.</i>

253
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,466
<i>And then I went out with the Wolf Man.
Ugh! What an evening.</i>

254
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,635
<i>I didn't know whether
to kiss him good night...</i>

255
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:57,432
Vampira, you will come under my spell.

256
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:03,346
You will be my slave of love.

257
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,308
My gosh, Bela! How do you do that?

258
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,439
You must be double-jointed.

259
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,862
And you must be Hungarian.

260
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:17,076
Vampira, look at me.

261
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:20,121
Look into my eyes.

262
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,870
<i>You're watching our Halloween movie,
White Zombie</i>

263
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,289
<i>starring Bela Lugosi,
John Harron, Madge Bellamy,</i>

264
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,996
<i>and a bunch of other people
I've never heard of.</i>

265
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,715
I'm very tired.

266
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,090
I need to take my medicine.

267
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,226
- Do you want me to get it for you?
- No.

268
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,721
Thank you, Eddie. I'll be all right.

269
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,590
on, shit.

270
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,978
I feel much better!

271
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:37,281
Children! I love children!

272
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:46,457
Trick or treat!

273
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,704
Aren't you scared, little boy?

274
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:54,381
I'm going to drink your blood.

275
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,458
You're not a real vampire.

276
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,712
Those teeth don't frighten me.

277
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,428
How about these?

278
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:08,479
Hey, how'd you do that?

279
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:12,309
Dentures. Lost my pearlies in the war.

280
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:17,029
So, what was the important news you
couldn't tell me on the phone, again?

281
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,944
I started thinking about
what you were saying

282
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,900
about how your movies
need to make a profit.

283
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:24,908
What is the one thing, if you put it
in a movie, it'll be successful?

284
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:27,536
- Tits.
- No, better than that. A star.

285
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:31,001
Kid, you must have me
confused with David Selznick.

286
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,420
I don't make major motion pictures,
I make crap.

287
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:37,250
Yes! But if you take that crap and put
a star in it, then you've got something.

288
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,257
- Yeah. Crap with a star.
- No, something better!

289
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,134
Something impressive.

290
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,178
Maybe the biggest money-maker
you've ever had.

291
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,555
Fine, all right.

292
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,979
You may be right,
but it doesn't frickin' matter.

293
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:52,477
I can't afford a star,
so what are we even talkin' about?

294
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,856
All right. What if I told you
you could have a star for $1,000?

295
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,278
Who?

296
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,987
- Lugosi?
- Yes! Lugosi!

297
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,447
Isn't he dead?

298
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,623
No, he's not dead.
He lives in Baldwin Hills.

299
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,292
I met him recently and he really wants
to be in our movie.

300
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:15,497
Why would Lugosi want
to do a sex change flick?

301
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:18,090
Because he's my friend!

302
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,587
All right, fine! You can direct it.

303
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:26,300
I want a script in three days.
We start shooting a week from Monday.

304
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:31,764
Mr. Weiss, thank you so much. You
won't regret it. I won't let you down.

305
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:38,728
But, Bunny, you're perfect for this job.
You know these people.

306
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:42,111
I need all the transsexuals
and transvestites I can get.

307
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,692
No, I don't care if they're not actors.
I want realism!

308
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:47,536
I want this film to tell the truth.

309
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,534
Coming!

310
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:53,334
I've waited all my life for this shot,
and I'm not gonna blow it.

311
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:57,004
- Eddie, you got a new movie for me, eh?
- Yes!

312
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:00,674
It's gonna be a great picture and you'll
love your character. Have a seat.

313
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:06,594
Listen, Bunny? Bela's here. I gotta go.

314
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:10,139
Listen, hit the bars, work some parties,
and get me transvestites!

315
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,596
I need transvestites! All right. Bye.

316
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,776
Eddie, what kind of a movie is this?

317
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,901
Well, it's about how people
have two personalities:

318
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,359
the side they show to the world, and
then the secret person they hide inside.

319
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,451
Like Jekyll and Hyde.

320
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,996
I've always wanted
to play Jekyll and Hyde.

321
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,915
I'm looking forward to this production.

322
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:36,164
Well, your part's a little different.

323
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,836
You're like the god that looks over

324
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,754
all the characters
and oversees everything.

325
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,375
I don't understand.

326
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:45,007
You control everyone's fate.
You're like the puppet master.

327
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:51,726
- Ah, so I pull the strings!
- Yes, you pull the strings.

328
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,430
"Pull the strings." I like that!

329
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,394
Honey!

330
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:04,856
I got a little surprise for you.

331
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,986
Wipe off your hands.

332
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:11,950
- I finished my script.
- Oh!

333
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:14,578
Ed, I'm so proud of you!

334
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,086
<i>I'll read it as soon as I get home.</i>

335
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,960
Well, I'd really like
to know what you think.

336
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:25,293
Why don't you go in the bedroom
and take a look? I'll wait.

337
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,304
Go ahead.

338
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,346
Take your time.

339
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,388
So that's where my sweater's been.

340
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:23,559
How long have you been doing this?

341
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,066
Since I was a kid.

342
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:31,071
My mom wanted a girl, so she
used to dress me in girlie clothing.

343
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,073
Just became a habit.

344
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,580
Jesus Christ! And you never told me?

345
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,703
Well, this is my way of telling you.

346
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:42,628
What, by putting it in a fucking script
for everyone to see?

347
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:45,081
What kind of sick mind
operates like that?

348
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,917
And what about this,
this so-called Barbara character

349
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,968
that's obviously me?

350
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,045
I mean, this is our life.
It's so embarrassing!

351
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:54,209
Of course it is.
That's why you should play the part.

352
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:55,724
Oh, you got nerve, buddy.

353
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:59,178
- It's a darn good role.
- That's not the issue!

354
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:03,061
God, how can you act so casual
when you're dressed like that?

355
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:06,693
It makes me feel comfortable.

356
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:10,023
Oh, just like in the script.

357
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,028
Exactly.

358
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,330
So, what do you say?

359
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,328
Do we break up?

360
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,666
Or do you want to make
the movie with me?

361
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:31,969
They make you tall, and you're flashy.
They want that.

362
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:35,135
Okay. But they want professionalism,
so nix on the Nelly

363
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,762
without losing naiveté, okay?

364
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:38,888
Now, the good news is

365
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,686
you're probably going to get hired
because you look like Peggy Lee.

366
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:45,107
But I don't want anybody else
to resent that, okay? Please?

367
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,184
'Cause there's enough
for everybody, exotics, too.

368
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,520
All right, because if you're not going
to smile, please don't bother.

369
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:50,604
You'll embarrass me.

370
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:51,939
This is George Weiss.

371
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:54,445
He's done some very important things,
he's a nice person to know.

372
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,902
I thought you were gonna make
a sex change film!

373
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,864
- It's still a sex change film.
- Yeah! Five pages before it ends!

374
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:02,541
The rest is about some schmuck
who likes angora sweaters!

375
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,209
I don't think he's a schmuck.

376
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:07,914
<i>What about this title? My poster says,
I Changed My Sex.</i>

377
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,122
So change the poster.

378
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:12,085
Trust me, you'll be better off.
This story's gonna grab people.

379
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,637
It's about this guy, he's crazy about
this girl, but he likes to wear dresses.

380
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:19,433
Should he tell her? Should he not
tell her? He's torn. This is drama!

381
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:22,307
Fine! Shoot whatever baloney you want.

382
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,263
Just make sure it's seven reels long.

383
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:28,897
Testing.

384
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,946
Excuse me. Can I get
everyone's attention, please?

385
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,943
Could you gather around?

386
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,744
I've got something to say.

387
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:43,582
Everybody, we're about to embark on
quite a journey: four days of hard work.

388
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:47,457
But when it's over, we'll have a picture
that'll entertain, enlighten

389
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:50,210
and maybe even move
millions of people.

390
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,709
Excuse me, Eddie. I don't mean to
interrupt. I'm worried about the light.

391
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,341
Good thinking. All right, we'll talk
about days three and four later.

392
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:00,766
Let's get that first shot off. Scene 17,
Glenda looking in the window.

393
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:04,846
And action!

394
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,408
And cut!

395
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,577
Print that! Let's move on!

396
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,624
Don't you want a second take
for protection?

397
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,794
What's to protect?
It was perfect! Come on!

398
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,918
Hey! Cops!

399
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,544
We don't have a permit. Run!

400
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,471
Come on. Let's go.

401
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:48,146
What's going on
with these revised pages?

402
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,518
Mr. Lugosi's here.

403
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,192
Oh, my God! Mr. Lugosi's here!

404
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,736
Everyone! Everyone!

405
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,781
Everyone, come on. Come in here.

406
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,532
Listen.

407
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,535
When he walks onto the stage,
treat him normal.

408
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:09,835
I know Bela Lugosi's a world-famous
star and you're all very excited

409
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,379
but look, we are professionals.

410
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:16,209
So, just treat him with respect.
Everything will be all right.

411
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,721
Bela!

412
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:32,392
Great to see ya!
8:00 on the dot. Right on time.

413
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:34,985
- I'm always on time.
- Of course you are.

414
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,233
We've got a big day
planned for you.

415
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,313
But first we're gonna start out

416
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,277
kinda easy with you
in that armchair over there.

417
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,783
Then once you're up to speed
and cookin',

418
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,405
we'll reset
and bring in the lab equipment.

419
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,453
- Eddie?
- Huh?

420
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,995
- What about my money?
- Huh? Oh.

421
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,854
What are you people doing?
Get back to work!

422
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,616
All right, people. Let's get ready.

423
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,680
Mr. Lugosi, I know you're very busy

424
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:47,132
but, can I have your autograph?

425
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,309
Certainly.

426
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:57,897
<i>You know which movie of yours I love,
Mr. Lugosi? The Invisible Ray.</i>

427
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,941
You were great as Karloff's sidekick.

428
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:04,407
Karloff?

429
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,661
Sidekick?

430
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,739
Fuck you!

431
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:14,497
Karloff does not deserve
to smell my shit!

432
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:17,546
That limey cocksucker
can rot in hell for all I care!

433
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,123
What happened?

434
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:21,459
How dare that asshole
bring up Karloff?

435
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,919
You think it takes talent
to play Frankenstein?

436
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:27,514
It's all make-up and grunting.

437
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,138
I agree. Bela, I agree 100%.

438
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:33,221
Now, Dracula, that's a role
that requires talent.

439
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:36,398
Of course! Dracula requires presence.

440
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:39,067
It's all in the eyes and the voice

441
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,270
- and the hand.
- That's right. That's right.

442
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:44,653
You seem a little agitated. You wanna
go outside and get some air?

443
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:47,780
Bullshit! I'm ready now.
Roll the camera!

444
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,784
We're rolling.

445
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,742
- Sound. Speed.
- Scene 97, take one. Mark.

446
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,293
Action.

447
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:04,300
Beware.

448
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,470
Beware.

449
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:12,885
Beware of the big, green dragon

450
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:15,517
that sits on your doorstep.

451
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,937
He eats little boys,

452
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,110
Puppy dog tails,

453
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:26,156
and big, fat snails.

454
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,155
Beware.

455
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,202
Take care.

456
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:35,916
Beware.

457
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,703
Wait!

458
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:46,543
Pull the string! Pull the string!

459
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,509
Cut.

460
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,346
Perfect.

461
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:57,183
But Georgie, I'm proud.
I wrote, directed and starred in it

462
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,765
just like Orson Welles did
in Citizen Kane.

463
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:03,022
Yeah, well, Orson Welles didn't
wear angora sweaters, did he?

464
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:13,707
How can you just walk around like that
in front of all these people?

465
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:18,997
Well, hon, nobody's bothered but you.
Look around.

466
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,827
Ed, this isn't the real world!

467
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,708
You've surrounded yourself
with a bunch of weirdoes.

468
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,420
Oh, say it a little louder.
I don't think Bela heard you.

469
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:35,096
Dolores.

470
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,515
I need your help.

471
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:44,443
My mind's in a muddle,
like in a thick fog.

472
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,148
I thought I could stop
wearing these things.

473
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,575
I tried. Honestly, I tried.

474
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:10,719
Glen.

475
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:13,923
I don't fully understand

476
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,508
but maybe together
we can work this out.

477
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:45,086
Music swells. Cut and print!

478
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,129
It's a wrap.

479
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:53,507
How do you do?
I'm here to see Mr. Feldman.

480
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,630
What's your name?

481
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,341
Edward D. Wood, Jr.

482
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,775
He's in the executive building.

483
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:13,232
- You can park in the reserved section.
- Thanks very much.

484
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:16,238
- Please, sit down.
- Thanks.

485
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:22,408
So, what are you bringing me?
Looks like you got some film cans.

486
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:26,120
Well, some people bring their resumes.
I've brought my own movie.

487
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,580
Really. Well, good for you.

488
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:32,713
I just shot this baby for
Screen Classics. It opens next week.

489
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:36,092
Screen Classics?
No, I don't know them.

490
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,139
There's something you should know.

491
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,763
Nobody in town has seen this picture,

492
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,061
so I'm giving you
first crack at my talents.

493
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:45,184
Thank you.

494
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,312
And I'm anxious to see it.

495
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,314
So, what's up next for you?

496
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,361
I don't believe in thinking small,

497
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,565
so I've got
a whole slate of pictures for you.

498
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,649
You ready? Okay.

499
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,036
<i>The Vampire's Tomb.</i>

500
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,411
<i>The Ghoul Goes West.</i>

501
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,919
And

502
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:13,087
<i>Doctor Acula.</i>

503
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,843
<i>Doctor Acula?
I don't get it.</i>

504
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:22,934
<i>Doctor</i>

505
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,103
<i>Racula.</i>

506
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:27,222
Oh, I get it.

507
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,228
I don't like it.

508
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:32,356
But it'll star Bela Lugosi.

509
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:37,362
Bela Lugosi? Lugosi's
all washed-up. What else you got?

510
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:44,327
Well, I do have another project.

511
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,783
I wasn't going to tell you about it.

512
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,210
Lugosi's in it, but it's a small part.

513
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,663
The lead is an ingénue.

514
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:55,125
A sterling, young actress,
Dolores Fuller.

515
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,007
The title of the film:

516
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:01,886
<i>Bride Of The Atom!</i>

517
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:03,383
Ah.

518
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,644
Atomic age stuff, huh?

519
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,649
I like it. I like it.

520
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:14,523
I tell you what, Mr. Ward. Why don't
you leave your film cans with me.

521
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:17,071
And my associates and I will
take a look at your little opus

522
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,774
and maybe we can do
some business together.

523
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:24,455
<i>Take care. Beware.</i>

524
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:29,789
<i>Pull the string! Pull the string!</i>

525
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,791
What the hell is this?

526
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,544
- Is this an actual movie?
- It can't be!

527
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:39,002
<i>Give this man satin
undies, a dress, sweater and skirt,</i>

528
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,087
<i>or even the lounging outfit he has on</i>

529
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,513
<i>and he's the happiest human being
in the world.</i>

530
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:44,091
Wait a minute.

531
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:47,268
Wait a minute. That guy in the dress.

532
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,641
That's the guy I met today.

533
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:52,724
Oh, this has got to be a put-on.

534
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,481
<i>These things are his comfort.</i>

535
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,905
This is probably another
one of Billy Wellman's practical jokes.

536
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,357
<i>He just entered the street dressed</i>

537
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,909
<i>in the clothes
he so much desires to wear.</i>

538
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:05,737
<i>But, only if he really appears female:</i>

539
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,743
<i>long hair, make-up, clothing,
the actual contours of a girl.</i>

540
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:08,914
Oh, God!

541
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:12,085
<i>Most transvestites do not want
to change their life, their bodies.</i>

542
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,504
This is funny. This is funny.

543
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,009
Thank you.

544
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,770
Georgie, I thought Glen Or Glenda?

545
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,400
Was opening this week.
Where's the ads?

546
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,606
Where's the ads?

547
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,942
The ads are in Alabama, Indiana,
Missouri, you schmuck!

548
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,944
It ain't gonna play in L.A.!

549
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:49,031
- Why not?
- Nobody wants to see this piece of shit!

550
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,865
Hey, you can't talk that way
about my movie!

551
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,828
I wish it was your movie!

552
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:57,756
I wish I hadn't blown every dime I ever
made into making this stink bomb!

553
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,504
And if I ever see ya again,
I'll kill ya!

554
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:05,138
Hello?

555
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:06,681
Georgie?

556
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:20,236
- Guess where I'm going next week?
- I don't know. Where?

557
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,564
Mexico.

558
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:26,276
- Guess what I'm doing when I get there.
- I don't know. Lie on a beach.

559
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:30,455
Wrong. I'm getting my first series
of hormone injections.

560
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,658
When those girls kick in

561
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,790
they're gonna take out my organs
and make me a woman.

562
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,462
Are you serious?

563
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:41,667
It's something I've wanted to do
for a long time.

564
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:45,845
But it wasn't until I saw your movie
that I realized I have to take action!

565
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,174
- Goodbye, penis!
- Would you please keep it down.

566
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:52,636
The "Super Swedish Angel,"
Tor Johnson!

567
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,108
My gosh, look at that guy.
He's a mountain!

568
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:29,590
And after I'm a woman, Jean-Claude
and I are going to be married.

569
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,642
- I'm going to be a June bride.
- He's a monster.

570
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:36,062
Can you imagine what that guy
would look like in a movie?

571
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:46,481
Yeah, yeah! Yeah!

572
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:49,109
Mmm. More neck.

573
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,281
Mr. Johnson,
congratulations on your victory.

574
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,580
Thank you.

575
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,409
- Did you bring my water?
- No, I'm not the water boy.

576
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,416
I'm a movie director.

577
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:03,248
<i>- Movies? Like the Mickey Mouse?
- Sure.</i>

578
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:07,381
- I'll get you next week!
- Yeah, right. In your dreams!

579
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:10,889
Tor... Uh, Mr. Johnson.

580
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:13,887
You ever fancy the notion
of becoming an actor?

581
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,934
Not good-looking enough.

582
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:19,105
Well, I think you're quite handsome.

583
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,232
Do my toes.

584
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:26,271
So, anyway, I've got this new script,
Bride Of The Atom.

585
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:29,528
And there's a part
I believe you're ideal for.

586
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,569
Lobo. He's tough, he's a brute.

587
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:35,781
But he's got a good heart. At the end
of the picture, he saves the girl.

588
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,616
I like!
When do movie shoot?

589
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,622
Hopefully, very soon.

590
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,741
I'm just waiting for the final okay from
my good pal at Warners, Mr. Feldman.

591
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:51,296
<i>- Wood Productions.
- Eddie, help me.</i>

592
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:54,929
<i>- Bela?
- Eddie, please come over.</i>

593
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,718
Bela?

594
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,454
Bela?

595
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,666
Bela!

596
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,716
Bela!

597
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,426
Bela? What happened?

598
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:41,221
Eddie.

599
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:43,602
I didn't feel well.

600
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,276
Come on,
let me get you to the hospital.

601
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,649
No hospital.

602
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:52,073
Just take me to the couch.

603
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:56,995
- Should I call a doctor?
- No.

604
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,993
This happens all the time.

605
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,795
Is there anything I can get for you?
Water or a blanket?

606
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:09,131
Goulash.

607
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,795
I don't know how to make goulash.

608
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,718
Bela, what's in the needle?

609
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,769
Morphine.

610
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,477
With a Demerol chaser.

611
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:33,031
Oh, Eddie. Eddie, I'm so broke.

612
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,275
I don't know what I'm going to do.

613
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:42,498
Don't worry, Bela.

614
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,832
I won't let you down.

615
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:52,133
Mr. Feldman? Ed Wood.

616
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:55,257
Yeah, listen, I haven't been able
to get through, so I just showed up.

617
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,304
Yeah! Right out front.

618
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,758
So, we gonna be working together?

619
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:04,846
Really? Worst film you ever saw.

620
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:08,149
Well, my next one will be better.

621
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:11,194
Hello. Hello.

622
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:14,939
I'm no good.

623
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,946
Oh, Ed, it was just one man's opinion.

624
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:21,529
Bela needs a job.
I can't even get a film going.

625
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,456
Of course I can't.
I made the worst movie of all time.

626
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:26,455
Oh, that's ridiculous.

627
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,584
All I wanna do is tell stories.

628
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:33,507
The things that I find interesting.

629
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:36,802
Well, maybe you're not
studio kind of material.

630
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,847
Maybe you just need
to raise the money yourself.

631
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,219
<i>The movie is called Bride Of The Atom.</i>

632
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:48,307
It will star Bela Lugosi.

633
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:50,983
There are quarter shares
available at $15,000 each.

634
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:54,069
Yes, that's right. The Bela Lugosi.

635
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:57,482
He's still alive.

636
00:46:57,565 --> 00:47:01,195
Huh? Is he available Friday night?

637
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:03,996
Well, gee, I suppose so. Why?

638
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:08,076
"Greetings, I am the Count."

639
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:11,288
"Greetings, I am Slick Slomopavitz,
Seeker of Adventure.

640
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:15,091
"Audience laughs, applauds.
'Say, that's a kooky place to sleep."'

641
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:19,421
- "It is my home."
- "Oh, tract housing, huh? Laugh."

642
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:22,173
"You need a new real estate agent."

643
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,179
"I beg to differ.

644
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,933
"This casket incap... incarpertate..."

645
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:29,935
No, Bela, that's "incorporates."

646
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:32,767
Look, why don't you just say,
"This casket has..."

647
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:36,233
How do they expect a Hungarian
to pronounce this dialogue?

648
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:39,236
This live television is madness!

649
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:41,613
Furthermore, I predict

650
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,992
by April 19, 1970,

651
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:49,042
I predict men will have colonized Mars.

652
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,289
Millions of people will live there.

653
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:55,047
Wow! Ain't that somethin'?

654
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:01,838
And now we take you
to a castle in Transylvania.

655
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:06,927
Watch out. The landlord's
a real pain in the neck.

656
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:27,906
Greetings! I am the Count!

657
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:31,583
Greetings, pal! I'm Slick Slomopavitz,
Seeker of Adventure!

658
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:35,250
Hey, what a kooky place to sleep.

659
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,832
Kind of reminds me of my house.
What a dump!

660
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:40,836
Some places got a Murphy bed,
this place got a Murphy shower.

661
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,421
I still don't know where
to hang the towels.

662
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:45,427
I beg to differ.

663
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:50,763
Beg to differ? A bloodsucker, right?
I'm talkin' about my towels.

664
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:58,519
Greetings! I am the Count.

665
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:06,239
Damn!

666
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:15,545
A bum is what he is.
I told you we should've got Karloff!

667
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,962
Ah, don't worry about it, Bela.
You're better than all this.

668
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,543
I never said I could ad-lib.

669
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,845
Forget it! We'll make our own movie
and you'll be a big star again.

670
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,297
Aha!

671
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:30,886
Mr. Lugosi, it is an unparalleled
privilege to meet you, sir.

672
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:34,347
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Criswell.

673
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:36,398
It's a pleasure.

674
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:40,570
Ah, cheer up. Don't lose heart
over what happened tonight.

675
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:45,070
I predict your next project will
be an outstanding success!

676
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:47,568
Wow!

677
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:49,745
And who may you be?

678
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,869
- Edward D. Wood, Jr.
- Ah!

679
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:56,373
<i>- The director of Glen Or Glenda?
- How'd you know?</i>

680
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:59,797
I am Criswell. I know all.

681
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:12,598
And bingo! Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

682
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:16,689
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis.

683
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:18,687
Ed, another whiskey.

684
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:20,689
Dagmar, a rum and coke?

685
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:22,862
Moustapha and King are Chablis.

686
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:25,986
Bela, would you like a wine?

687
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:29,489
No. I never drink wine.

688
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:39,203
Say, Cris, how'd you know we'd be
living on Mars by 1970?

689
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,210
- I guessed.
- Really?

690
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,257
I made it up.

691
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:46,301
It's horse shit.

692
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:50,427
<i>Eddie, there's no such thing
as a psychic.</i>

693
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:54,477
People believe my folderol
because I wear a black tuxedo.

694
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:57,556
- It's that easy?
- Eddie, we're in show biz.

695
00:50:57,638 --> 00:51:01,063
It's all about razzle-dazzle,
appearances.

696
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:04,896
If you look good and you talk well,
people will swallow anything.

697
00:51:13,362 --> 00:51:17,538
We are going to have the most terrifying
monster ever seen on film.

698
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:21,917
A ghastly creature created
from an atomic mutation!

699
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:23,919
I don't like scary movies.

700
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:25,921
I like the ones with love stories.

701
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,924
That's just what this movie is:
a heartbreaking romance.

702
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:30,971
You're quite a specimen.

703
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,890
- And you're going to be in the picture?
- Yeah. I play Lobo.

704
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:38,472
I predict Bride Of The Atom will be
the biggest moneymaker of all time.

705
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:42,525
And this is lovely starlet Dolores
Fuller, who will play Janet Lawton.

706
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,945
My pleasure, ma'am.
Now, how much will this picture cost?

707
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:49,445
Well, in a normal studio it'd be
about a million bucks

708
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:52,493
with all their wasteful overhead
and fancy offices.

709
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:55,249
But we're more efficient, so we could
bring it in at about 70 grand.

710
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,999
Oh.
Well, I shall certainly consider it.

711
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:02,374
- Well, goodbye.
- Good night, Ed. Keep in touch.

712
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:04,421
Goodbye.

713
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:09,217
Well, Eddie, how'd we do?

714
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:11,091
We didn't make a nickel.

715
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:14,970
I cannot believe
I'm in Hollywood.

716
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:17,848
You know, Daddy didn't
want me to move out here.

717
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,018
Uh-huh.

718
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:22,394
Ma'am, your bill comes to $2.20.

719
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:25,443
Oh. Uh, okay.
I hope you don't mind

720
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:28,646
but all I have is a fifty.
I just came from my banker's.

721
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:30,697
- That's all right.
- Thank you.

722
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:40,241
Excuse me. You just moved here?

723
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:43,578
Yes. Hollywood is, oh, so exciting.

724
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,413
Isn't it?

725
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:48,166
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
I'm Loretta King.

726
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,421
Edward D. Wood, Jr.

727
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,924
Hi.
Would you like some water?

728
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,004
No!

729
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:56,511
No water. No liquids.

730
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,718
I'm terribly allergic to them.

731
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:03,602
You know, I work in Hollywood.
I'm a producer.

732
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:05,604
Really? Wow!

733
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:08,232
I would love to be involved in that.

734
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:11,280
Is that right?
Well, maybe I can help you out.

735
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:14,609
Have you ever thought about
investing in a motion picture?

736
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,860
Perhaps a small amount of money.

737
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:18,821
How much
do your motion pictures cost?

738
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:22,746
Well, my new one, I think,
would be about $60,000.

739
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:26,875
That's all? That seems very reasonable
for an entire picture.

740
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:32,927
Would you like to

741
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:36,380
- have a look at the photoplay?
- Oh, sure.

742
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:40,430
Oh, my.

743
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:43,058
This is very interesting.

744
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:46,061
Say, do you think it would be possible

745
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,359
for me to maybe
play one of these parts?

746
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:51,404
Oh, you want to be an actress, too.
Well, of course.

747
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:55,233
There's a couple of parts I can think of
right now that you might be perfect for.

748
00:53:55,315 --> 00:54:00,116
There's the secretary in the
newspaper office, the file clerk...

749
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:02,914
Hmm. Those sound kind of small.

750
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:06,706
Here's one that looks good,
Janet Lawton.

751
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,340
I'd sure like to play her.

752
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:13,463
- Janet Lawton.
- Yes.

753
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:16,512
Janet Lawton is clearly
the part to play.

754
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,683
Can't you just see me in the part?

755
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,357
Yes!

756
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:31,356
You'd be perfect.

757
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,568
You bastard!

758
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:39,777
You two-timing,
dress-wearing son of a bitch!

759
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:42,830
Honey, it was the only way
I could get the movie made!

760
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:44,828
Who do you think's
been paying the rent?

761
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:48,878
Who's been helping you type
your scripts and do all your grunt work?

762
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,513
I am sorry!
What did you want me to say?

763
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:52,047
You were supposed to say,

764
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:56,923
"No. I wrote that part for
my girlfriend Dolores!"

765
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:01,765
Snowball, there are
plenty of other parts.

766
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,434
Like what?

767
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:08,681
- The secretary, the file clerk.
- Aaaaah!

768
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:11,734
You asshole!

769
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:18,320
This is gonna be Bela's laboratory,
so it should be real impressive

770
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,776
just like one of those
"Mad Scientist" movies.

771
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:24,155
I want test tubes, beakers and one
of those electrical things that buzzes.

772
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:26,991
- You mean a Tesla coil?
- Fine. Whatever. Hop to it!

773
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:29,042
Right! Right.

774
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:32,754
- Eddie?
- Yes?

775
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:36,676
- Which dress do you like better?
- Hmm. I don't know.

776
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:41,130
Say, Bill, which dress works better
for you, the red one or the green one?

777
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:44,183
- Which one is the red one?
- What do you mean?

778
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:47,637
I mean, I can't see the difference,
I'm color blind.

779
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,892
But I kinda like the dark gray one.

780
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:56,650
At Universal, we used to shoot
one or two scenes a day.

781
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:59,732
But Eddie can knock off 20, 30.

782
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:02,443
- He's incredible!
- And action!

783
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:10,247
Okay, you're Dr. Eric Vornoff

784
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,248
and you're upset.

785
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:13,795
You've worked very hard
on this experiment

786
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:16,545
and you don't want to see it fail.

787
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,546
No, you're not that upset.

788
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:22,004
You wanna keep moving.
You wanna go through that door.

789
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:27,809
And cut! Beautiful.

790
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:30,479
Print it. Let's move immediately
to scene 52.

791
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:32,477
- Tor, you in place?
- Yeah.

792
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:34,854
- Great. Roll camera!
- Rolling. Slate.

793
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,899
Cue rainstorm.

794
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:39,901
And action, Tor.

795
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:46,154
Okay. You're Lobo.

796
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,159
You're upset.

797
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:52,209
You've worked very hard helping
Dr. Vornoff with this experiment.

798
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:55,208
You don't wanna see it fail.

799
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:57,255
No, no. You're not that upset.

800
00:56:57,331 --> 00:57:00,301
You wanna keep moving.
You've got to get through that door.

801
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,175
And cut! Perfect!

802
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:11,395
- Print it. Let's move on.
- Don't you wanna do another take, Ed?

803
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:14,440
Looks like big baldy had a little
trouble gettin' through the door.

804
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:16,482
No, it's fine. It's real.

805
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:20,863
You know, in actuality, Lobo would have
to struggle with that problem every day.

806
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:25,113
All right, people, let's get ready.
Actors! I must have my actors!

807
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:26,444
There you are.

808
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:29,279
Loretta, Tor, I wanna explain this scene,
it's a little complicated, but...

809
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:32,617
Bela, you'll be sitting there. Okay?

810
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,622
I'm not getting near
that goddamn thing.

811
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:36,954
<i>One of them burned me
on The Return Of Chandu.</i>

812
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:38,710
All right.

813
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:41,792
- Then you'll be sitting there.
- Good.

814
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:44,173
Great. All right, gang,
here's the scene.

815
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:47,631
Loretta, you're in a trance, you glide
in and get on the operating table.

816
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:50,934
Now, Tor, you're supposed to tie her
down, but you have an angora fetish

817
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:54,138
and when you rub that swatch
of angora, it makes you refuse.

818
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:58,192
So then Bela has to discipline you.
All right? Great! Let's do it!

819
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,941
Action!

820
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:09,950
Strap her to the table.

821
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:14,825
Do as I command you!

822
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:20,047
I'll teach you to disobey me!

823
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:22,090
- You will obey!
- Uhhhh!

824
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:24,839
- Strap her in!
- Uhhhh!

825
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,922
Strap her in! I command you!

826
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:30,929
- Wood! Your check bounced.
- I'll get you the money later.

827
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:33,602
- No, I need it now.
- I'll teach you to disobey me!

828
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,645
Cut!

829
00:58:36,138 --> 00:58:39,312
I am terribly sorry to bother you
while you're shooting

830
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:42,361
but the guy that owns the stage
needs his money.

831
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:45,781
Well, then, you should
pay him, shouldn't you?

832
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:48,234
Yes. Exactly.

833
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,915
I kind of need it now.

834
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:02,464
What are you looking at me
like that for?

835
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:05,713
I already gave you my three hundred.

836
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:07,715
Right.

837
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,468
And now I need
the other sixty thousand.

838
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:13,300
What other sixty thousand?

839
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:18,977
The other sixty thousand
you said you'd give to me.

840
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:21,525
You misunderstood, Eddie.

841
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,230
I gave you everything I have in
the world, three hundred dollars.

842
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:44,923
Well, here we go again.

843
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:47,376
Let me tell ya, ya can't lose.

844
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:50,633
It's scary. And if you don't like that,
it's romantic.

845
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:53,682
Bela Lugosi will portray
Dr. Eric Vornoff.

846
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:03,400
And lovely, lovely, lovely
ingénue Loretta King

847
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:06,111
is reporter Janet Lawton.

848
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:09,190
- I don't know. Lugosi looks pretty old.
- Huh?

849
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,692
Which role does Vampira play?

850
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:15,529
Vampira? Why do you ask?

851
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,865
She's standing right over there.

852
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,169
Well, she plays...

853
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,674
Excuse me one minute.

854
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,128
Pardon me. Miss Vampira?

855
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:34,181
- Yes?
- You don't know me, but I'm Ed Wood.

856
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:37,635
I'm a film producer and I'm currently in
production on a science fiction piece

857
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:40,095
with Bela Lugosi
and Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson.

858
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:42,226
I don't understand.
Do you want my autograph?

859
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:45,438
No.

860
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:48,236
No, I think my film is perfect for you.

861
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:50,656
You want me to show it
on my TV programme.

862
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,323
I have nothing to do with that.

863
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:54,151
You should call the station manager
at Channel 7.

864
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:55,326
No, no. No, no, no, no.

865
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:59,498
I don't want you to show the movie,
I want you to be in it. Let me explain.

866
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:02,497
We started shooting, but after
three days we got shut down.

867
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:04,999
Now we're having a backers party
to raise some more money.

868
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,375
So I thought perhaps
you'd like to come over

869
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:08,502
just to say "howdy"
to some of the backers.

870
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:11,461
Look, I'm with some friends
and we're about to eat.

871
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:13,758
Please! It would just take one second.

872
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:15,464
Come over and meet the backers.

873
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:17,675
There is a really nice dentist
from Oxnard.

874
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:20,306
Look, buddy, I've got real offers
from real studios.

875
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:23,264
I don't need to blow some dentist
for a part. Forget it.

876
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:27,351
Miss Vampira!

877
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:29,903
- Please.
- Oh! Let's go.

878
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:34,904
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.
Let's get out of here.

879
01:01:34,983 --> 01:01:37,077
Yeah, I think you're right.

880
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:41,282
Thank you, folks, for comin' tonight,
but we better go.

881
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:45,160
And then Dr. Vornoff
falls into the pit

882
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:48,372
and his own octopus
attacks and eats him.

883
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:50,833
- The end.
- Whew!

884
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:54,299
- Well, that's quite a story.
- Yes.

885
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:58,056
So, uh, you made the movie

886
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:00,721
and now you wanna make it again?

887
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,677
No.

888
01:02:02,761 --> 01:02:06,732
We shot 10 minutes of the movie, and
now we're looking for completion funds.

889
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,808
Oh, son, you're too vague.

890
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:11,770
Billy Bob!

891
01:02:13,021 --> 01:02:15,820
You're cuttin' 'em too lean.

892
01:02:16,024 --> 01:02:18,072
Mr. McCoy.

893
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:20,991
How can I make you happy?

894
01:02:23,365 --> 01:02:25,208
Okay.

895
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:27,085
Two things.

896
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:32,417
Number one: I want the movie
to end with a big explosion.

897
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:36,503
Sky full of smoke.

898
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:40,178
Yes.

899
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:43,352
But it ends with Dr. Vornoff
falling into the pit.

900
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:45,770
Not anymore.

901
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:47,973
Number two:

902
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:49,649
I got a son.

903
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:53,521
He's a little slow, but a good boy.

904
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:58,985
And somethin' tells me
he'd make a helluva leadin' man.

905
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,369
Sounds perfect.

906
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:07,497
This is unbelievable.

907
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:10,419
I woulda bet a million bucks that
Ed wouldn't finish this picture.

908
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:13,419
Yeah, well, it ain't finished yet, kid.
Anything can happen.

909
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,759
Stay out of scratching distance.

910
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:19,133
Poodle, you made it.
I wasn't sure you got my message.

911
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:20,384
Well, of course I made it.

912
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:23,808
- Today's the file clerk's big scene.
- That's right.

913
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:26,636
I see the usual gang of misfits
and dope addicts are here.

914
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,564
- Janet, I want you...
- Say, who's the lug?

915
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:34,687
I want you staying away
from the old Willows place.

916
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:37,739
Why, that's Tony McCoy. He will be
portraying Lieutenant Dick Craig.

917
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,066
Really.

918
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:43,120
- How much money did he put up?
- None. But his dad gave me 5O grand.

919
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:46,198
Hmm. Wood Productions,
the mark of quality.

920
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:49,581
Listen, the movie's getting made,
that's all that matters.

921
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,628
- Hello, Harry.
- Oh, hi, Dolores.

922
01:03:52,704 --> 01:03:55,207
Oh! You're Dolores.

923
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:57,634
I've heard so much about you.

924
01:03:57,709 --> 01:04:00,633
I'm Loretta King.
Oh, here, take the chair.

925
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:02,192
Oh, don't be silly. Let Harry finish.

926
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:03,723
You still need some more work.

927
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:06,889
No. I'm finished.

928
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:10,347
- All I needed was a touch-up.
- Hmm. That mole still shows.

929
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:13,525
Uh, ladies! You both look fine.

930
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:16,979
Why don't we talk about the scene?

931
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:19,281
Okay, Janet Lawton has just discovered

932
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:21,859
that Dr. Vornoff bought
the old Willows estate

933
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:24,319
so now she wants to prove that
all the monster stories are true.

934
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,530
Well, Eddie, what's my motivation?

935
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:31,543
You're the file clerk. You're running
into the next room and bump into Janet.

936
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:33,086
What is our relationship?

937
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:36,381
Are we good friends,
or is she just a casual acquaintance?

938
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:40,051
Dolores, I have five days
to complete this picture.

939
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:42,094
Don't get goofy on me.

940
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:46,220
Action!

941
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:51,388
- Hi, Janet.
- Oh, hi, Marge.

942
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:54,771
- Janet, still on the monster hunt?
- What do you think?

943
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:57,482
I think the boss has been
looking for you all day.

944
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,530
Something about the police wanting
those monster stories 86'd.

945
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:04,075
- You've got the whole town in a panic.
- I can't hear you.

946
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:05,618
I said, you've got the who...

947
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:08,116
I know what you said,
but I can't hear you.

948
01:05:09,197 --> 01:05:11,575
I get it. See ya later.

949
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:16,500
And cut! That was perfect.

950
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:19,295
Of course it was.

951
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:22,131
Bravo! Bravo!

952
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:25,180
- Magnifico.
- Cris, you made it. Thanks a lot.

953
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:28,179
Naturally. Always happy to help
with a little larceny.

954
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,597
All right, everybody,
that's it for today.

955
01:05:30,677 --> 01:05:34,181
The prop crew has a little errand
to run. Paul. Connie.

956
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:50,205
Darn. I thought they kept this open.

957
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,328
Lobo will fix.

958
01:05:57,495 --> 01:06:00,214
Good boy.

959
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,426
- Wow!
- This place...

960
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:07,631
- Let's get the hell outta here.
- Not so fast. Not 'til we get it down.

961
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:10,217
There it is. Paul, go unhook it.

962
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,223
Right.

963
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:16,268
Fantastic.

964
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,691
It's beautiful.

965
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:21,395
- You sure this is gonna work?
- Yes.

966
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:24,485
You sure?

967
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:26,407
Yes, hurry. Do it.

968
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:39,417
My God!

969
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:43,087
We killed him.

970
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:48,926
Tor?

971
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:53,681
Better than wrestling.

972
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,683
Lights!

973
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:59,107
"Now, Janet, I want you stayin' away

974
01:06:59,224 --> 01:07:01,898
"from that old Willows place.
I want...

975
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:04,354
"Now, Janet, I..."

976
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:06,439
- Great.
- "I want you..."

977
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:08,491
- Connie!
- "I want you staying away..."

978
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:12,070
- The octopus has to live in the lake.
- This is kind of a stream.

979
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:13,780
No! It has to be underwater.

980
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:16,583
Let me look at this. Okay.

981
01:07:18,076 --> 01:07:20,579
Go set up by the lake.

982
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:23,791
Eddie. I'm so tired.

983
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,467
I don't know if I can handle
a night shoot.

984
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:29,092
Nonsense. You look great.

985
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:33,053
All right, look.

986
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:36,132
Why don't you have a nice nap and we'll
shoot around you for a little while.

987
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:38,980
- Thanks, buddy.
- You're welcome.

988
01:07:39,347 --> 01:07:41,315
All right, you kids.

989
01:07:57,031 --> 01:08:00,410
Hey, this is looking fantastic!

990
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:02,416
Paul, where's the octopus motor?

991
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:07,630
- What octopus motor?
- To make his legs move.

992
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:11,216
Don't blame me!

993
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:13,816
You didn't say anything about a
motor when I was on the ceiling!

994
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:18,519
What's he talking...

995
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:26,107
Paul lost the octopus motor.

996
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,860
All right, let's shoot this fucker.

997
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,237
Great.

998
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,569
Where do I go?

999
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:37,781
- You'll be fighting with the octopus.
- Out there?

1000
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:40,868
- Yes.
- What happened to the stream?

1001
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:43,958
Well, this is gonna look a lot better.

1002
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:47,416
We have to match it to the stock footage
of the octopus underwater.

1003
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:50,711
Aw, for Christ's sake.

1004
01:08:52,587 --> 01:08:54,464
Ehh.

1005
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:58,222
- Goddamn, it's cold!
- It'll warm up once you're in it.

1006
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:00,141
Fuck you! You come out here!

1007
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:03,393
Hey! Throw me that whiskey!

1008
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:15,242
Ah. How do you turn this on?

1009
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:20,665
Well, somebody misplaced
the octopus motor

1010
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:24,085
so when you get in there and fight
with him, shake his legs around.

1011
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,754
Looks like he's killin' ya.
Okay.

1012
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:31,171
<i>You know I turned down Frankenstein?</i>

1013
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:35,300
- What?
- After I did Dracula

1014
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:39,260
the studio offered me Frankenstein,
but I turned it down.

1015
01:09:40,385 --> 01:09:43,309
Part wasn't sexy enough.

1016
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:46,858
Too degrading for a big star like me.

1017
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:52,026
<i>Bela, I have 25 scenes
to shoot tonight.</i>

1018
01:09:53,106 --> 01:09:56,110
Oh. Sorry. Don't let me slow you down.

1019
01:09:56,693 --> 01:09:59,537
Okay. All right.

1020
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:01,660
All right.

1021
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:05,952
All right, let's put it on film!

1022
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:08,455
- Camera!
- We're rolling!

1023
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:11,298
- Sound!
- Ed, we don't have sound.

1024
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:12,546
Oh.

1025
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:14,627
And action!

1026
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:40,157
And cut!

1027
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,662
That was perfect!

1028
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:47,293
Come on! Come on, troops!

1029
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:50,338
Have a nice cup o' joe,
you'll feel much better.

1030
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:52,336
All right. All right, Harry.

1031
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:55,385
Mr. Wood? I only got one hour
of sleep last night.

1032
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:59,761
Yeah, well, I got no sleep, and I feel
great. Go get' em, kid, go get 'em.

1033
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:02,137
- I'm gettin' too old for this.
- Great work, Bill.

1034
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:04,344
Go ahead. Go get 'em.

1035
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:06,346
Be careful. Don't hurt him.

1036
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:09,357
Don't scratch the tentacles.

1037
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:13,777
Bela,

1038
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:16,773
I wanna thank you again for last night.

1039
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:19,780
That's fine, Eddie.
All in the line of duty.

1040
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:24,911
No, no, I want you to know how much
I appreciate all you've done for me.

1041
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:26,115
A great man like yourself

1042
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:28,577
shouldn't have to be wandering
through the muck at 4:00 a.m.

1043
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:33,043
Well, there are not a lot of fellas
I'd do it for.

1044
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:37,465
Say, I wrote something special for ya.

1045
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:41,764
I got to thinkin' about all
the sacrifices you've made and I...

1046
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:44,388
Well, I wrote you a...

1047
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:47,391
A new final speech.

1048
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:52,692
Well, this is quite a scene, Eddie.

1049
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:56,146
I know it's a lot to give you
at the last minute, Bela, but...

1050
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:58,323
These lines...

1051
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:00,946
I'll have no problem remembering.

1052
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,737
Great.

1053
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:08,791
All right, kids, let's knock 'em dead.

1054
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:13,588
My dear Professor Strowski,

1055
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:18,590
twenty years ago I was banned
from my homeland.

1056
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:21,758
I was classed as a madman,
a charlatan.

1057
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:25,721
Outlawed in the world of science

1058
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:29,429
which previously
honored me as a genius.

1059
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:32,686
Now here

1060
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:36,736
in this forsaken jungle hell,

1061
01:12:36,811 --> 01:12:39,781
I have proven that I am all right!

1062
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:41,779
Yes!

1063
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:44,953
The authorities have learned
how correct your findings were.

1064
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:48,034
So I am here

1065
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:50,082
to bring you home.

1066
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:57,589
Home?

1067
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:01,461
I have no home.

1068
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:04,596
Hunted.

1069
01:13:04,672 --> 01:13:07,175
Despised.

1070
01:13:07,258 --> 01:13:09,761
Living like an animal.

1071
01:13:09,844 --> 01:13:13,223
The jungle is my home.

1072
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:16,401
But I shall show the world

1073
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:19,570
that I can be its master!

1074
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:23,900
I shall perfect my own race of people,

1075
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:26,532
a race of atomic supermen

1076
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:29,330
that will conquer the world!

1077
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:39,419
Cut.

1078
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,509
That's a wrap.

1079
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:53,470
<i>Glen Or Glenda?
Now, that was a hell of a picture.</i>

1080
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:56,311
Yeah, but this new one is gonna be
a million times better.

1081
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,688
Is that possible?

1082
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:05,733
Mr. Bunny, what's wrong?

1083
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:08,786
I heard you were becoming a lady.

1084
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:11,496
Oh, that.

1085
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:14,788
Mexico

1086
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:17,211
was

1087
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:18,663
a nightmare.

1088
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:24,339
We got into a car accident,
he was killed.

1089
01:14:25,378 --> 01:14:27,346
Our luggage

1090
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:28,843
was stolen.

1091
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:32,643
The surgeon turned out to be

1092
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:34,220
a quack.

1093
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:37,690
If it hadn't been for these men,

1094
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:42,152
I don't know

1095
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:44,572
how I would've

1096
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:46,441
survived.

1097
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:09,676
Oh, wow!

1098
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:15,863
You people are insane!

1099
01:16:15,946 --> 01:16:17,869
You're wasting your lives making shit!

1100
01:16:17,948 --> 01:16:21,043
Nobody cares!
These movies are terrible!

1101
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,507
Dolores!

1102
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,844
Ed, it's over. I need a normal life.

1103
01:16:39,804 --> 01:16:43,024
- Did you really mean those things you...
- I'm tired of living like this.

1104
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,642
But, Poodle...

1105
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:47,069
I just stuck it out
so you could finish your movie

1106
01:16:47,144 --> 01:16:48,691
and now that it's done, so am I.

1107
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:04,704
<i>Ooh, that was
so scary, it gave me goose bumps.</i>

1108
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:09,421
<i>No, dummy, I didn't say "goose,"
I said ”goose bumps."</i>

1109
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:14,801
Well, be sure to join me next week
for The Mummy's Curse.

1110
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,474
Until then, pleasant nightmares.

1111
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:31,776
Okay, folks, we're off the air.

1112
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:33,699
That was a good show.

1113
01:17:33,774 --> 01:17:36,277
God, this show needs better jokes.

1114
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,454
- You got a phone call.
- Who is it?

1115
01:17:38,529 --> 01:17:41,248
I don't know.

1116
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:45,207
- Hello.
- Vampira? Ed Wood here.

1117
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:47,254
- Who?
- Ed Wood.

1118
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:49,252
<i>Remember,
I met you at the Brown Derby?</i>

1119
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:50,423
Oh, yeah, you.

1120
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:52,297
Listen, I was wondering
if you'd like to

1121
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:54,003
go out sometime,
grab some dinner maybe.

1122
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:56,430
You mean a date?
I thought you were a fag.

1123
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:58,007
No, I'm just a transvestite.

1124
01:17:58,215 --> 01:18:00,183
So, how's about Friday night?

1125
01:18:00,259 --> 01:18:03,012
Look, you seem like a nice guy,
but you're just not my type.

1126
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:06,645
<i>But keep in touch. Let me know
when your movie opens.</i>

1127
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:16,067
Hello?

1128
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:19,074
<i>Eddie, help me.</i>

1129
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:21,121
Bela?

1130
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:39,256
Bela.

1131
01:18:41,467 --> 01:18:43,310
Bela!

1132
01:18:47,223 --> 01:18:49,191
What do you want?

1133
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:53,229
You called me. Remember?

1134
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:58,155
What are you doing, Bela?

1135
01:18:58,275 --> 01:19:00,198
I'm going to kill myself.

1136
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:02,996
My gosh, what happened?

1137
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:08,620
Eddie.

1138
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:14,216
I got a letter from the government.

1139
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:16,510
They're canceling my

1140
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:18,254
unemployment.

1141
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:21,674
It's all I've got.

1142
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:25,261
Without it, I can't pay the rent.

1143
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:27,472
Don't you have any savings?

1144
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:31,351
Eddie, I'm obsolete.

1145
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,354
I have nothing to live for.

1146
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:38,865
Tonight, I shall die.

1147
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:46,077
Eddie!

1148
01:19:46,156 --> 01:19:49,126
You should come with me.

1149
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:52,546
- I don't think that's such a good idea.
- It's a wonderful idea.

1150
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:55,875
It'll be wonderful! We'll be at peace!

1151
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:59,087
In the afterlife, you don't have
to worry about finding work.

1152
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:01,297
Bela,

1153
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:03,348
I'm on your side.

1154
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:07,018
Gimme the gun.

1155
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:10,894
If you give me the gun

1156
01:20:10,973 --> 01:20:12,725
I'll make you a drink.

1157
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:16,649
What are you drinking, Bela?

1158
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:18,652
Formaldehyde.

1159
01:20:18,731 --> 01:20:20,950
Straight up, or on the rocks?

1160
01:20:35,748 --> 01:20:37,671
Eddie.

1161
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:39,718
I'm sorry.

1162
01:20:41,545 --> 01:20:43,513
I'm so sorry.

1163
01:20:43,589 --> 01:20:45,842
Don't worry, Bela.

1164
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:50,020
- I'm sorry, Eddie.
- Everything will be okay.

1165
01:20:58,437 --> 01:21:01,361
Oh, my goodness,
you gave me the willies!

1166
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,442
You look like that Dracula guy.

1167
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:07,530
My name is Bela Lugosi

1168
01:21:07,613 --> 01:21:09,786
and I wish to commit myself.

1169
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:12,789
For what reason?

1170
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:17,881
I have been a drug
addict for 20 years.

1171
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:19,924
I need help.

1172
01:22:06,422 --> 01:22:08,925
Is that angora?

1173
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:11,385
Um, yes.

1174
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:16,857
Don't you think angora
has a tactile sensuality

1175
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:19,310
lacking in all other clothing?

1176
01:22:19,393 --> 01:22:21,316
Yeah, I suppose.

1177
01:22:21,395 --> 01:22:23,614
It is awfully expensive.

1178
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:26,863
Well, it's made from
specially-bred rabbits

1179
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:28,865
that live in the Himalayas.

1180
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:32,823
Say, what are you,
an angora wholesaler?

1181
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:33,406
No.

1182
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:41,874
I'm in pictures.

1183
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:47,805
I'm a director, writer,
actor and producer.

1184
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:50,804
Aw, come on. Nobody does all that.

1185
01:22:50,883 --> 01:22:52,806
Oh, yes, they do. Two people.

1186
01:22:52,885 --> 01:22:54,933
Orson Welles and me.

1187
01:22:55,012 --> 01:22:56,980
Wow.

1188
01:22:57,055 --> 01:23:00,400
- Whatcha makin'?
- Booties. For my father.

1189
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:03,070
- Gets cold in the hospital.
- Mmm.

1190
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:06,695
- Has he been here long?
- This is my thirteenth pair.

1191
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:10,202
Excuse me.

1192
01:23:12,446 --> 01:23:14,244
Excuse me, Doctor.

1193
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:16,834
I'm with Mr. Lugosi. How is he?

1194
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:20,288
Well, there's a lot of junk in
his system for such an old man.

1195
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:22,293
Apparently he was
addicted to morphine.

1196
01:23:22,372 --> 01:23:25,592
He tried to kick that and he got
readdicted to methadone.

1197
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:28,637
- Is he gonna be okay?
- We'll do our best.

1198
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:37,396
- Hi, Lillian.
- Hi, Ed. He's got a lot of visitors today.

1199
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:39,269
- He does?
- Mmm-hmm.

1200
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:41,348
Smile. That's it!

1201
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:43,273
- Hey! Hey!
- One more picture, sir?

1202
01:23:43,352 --> 01:23:45,195
Do the doctors say
you're gonna get outta here?

1203
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:46,317
Freaks!

1204
01:23:46,396 --> 01:23:48,524
Get outta here! Get outta here!

1205
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:51,531
What is wrong with you people?
Come on, trash barrel!

1206
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:53,578
Hey!

1207
01:23:53,654 --> 01:23:55,577
Bela, what happened?

1208
01:23:55,656 --> 01:23:58,284
Eddie, why did you chase them?

1209
01:23:58,367 --> 01:24:02,622
After all these years, the press is
finally interested again in Bela Lugosi.

1210
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:04,710
Bela,

1211
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:08,340
those people are parasites,
they just wanna exploit you.

1212
01:24:08,627 --> 01:24:11,380
Fine. Let them.

1213
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:14,383
There is no such thing
as bad press, Eddie.

1214
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:19,188
Man from New York even said
he's putting me on the front page.

1215
01:24:20,514 --> 01:24:25,145
First celebrity ever to check into rehab.

1216
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:29,319
When I get out of here

1217
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:31,317
I will be healthy,

1218
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,494
strong.

1219
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:35,829
Primed for my comeback...

1220
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:50,006
Hello again.

1221
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:52,463
- Hi.
- You look beat.

1222
01:24:52,546 --> 01:24:55,345
No, I'm fine. How's your father?

1223
01:24:55,966 --> 01:24:58,936
Better. Thank you for asking.
And your friend?

1224
01:25:01,013 --> 01:25:03,015
Not good.

1225
01:25:04,683 --> 01:25:08,688
Well, I made him some booties
to cheer him up.

1226
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:13,530
They're black, to match his cape.

1227
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:20,203
Say, have you always
lived in Los Angeles?

1228
01:25:20,324 --> 01:25:22,918
No, I'm from back east.
Poughkeepsie.

1229
01:25:22,993 --> 01:25:26,998
You know, all-American small town,
everybody knows everybody,

1230
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:30,004
my dad worked for the post office,
I was a Boy Scout.

1231
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:32,882
- Did you find it boring?
- No, not at all.

1232
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:35,009
I had my comic books
and pulp magazines.

1233
01:25:35,088 --> 01:25:37,056
Used to listen to
radio dramas constantly.

1234
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:38,179
I love those shows.

1235
01:25:38,258 --> 01:25:40,226
<i>- The Shadow, Inner Sanctum.
- Yes.</i>

1236
01:25:40,594 --> 01:25:42,141
<i>And The Mercury Theater
with Orson Welles.</i>

1237
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:43,437
Mmm.

1238
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:46,392
Boy, you know, every Saturday
afternoon me and my dad

1239
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:49,399
marched down the street in our uniform
to the little movie theater.

1240
01:25:49,519 --> 01:25:51,567
Oh, the spook house!

1241
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:23,144
Aah!

1242
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:26,769
Aaaarrr!

1243
01:26:27,474 --> 01:26:30,273
You're not gonna believe
the first picture I ever saw.

1244
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:32,317
<i>It was your friend's... Dracula.</i>

1245
01:26:32,396 --> 01:26:34,990
That's incredible,
that's the first picture I ever saw.

1246
01:26:35,065 --> 01:26:36,362
That is incredible.

1247
01:26:36,441 --> 01:26:38,864
You know, I had to sleep
with the lights on for a week.

1248
01:26:38,944 --> 01:26:40,366
I had to for a month.

1249
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:43,119
But I never missed a Lugosi picture
after that one.

1250
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:47,878
A few years ago I actually saw him
do Dracula live.

1251
01:26:47,953 --> 01:26:49,921
It was much scarier in person.

1252
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:54,630
Oh. We're stuck.

1253
01:27:02,384 --> 01:27:04,136
Kathy.

1254
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:09,442
I'm about to tell you something that
I never told any girl on a first date.

1255
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:14,484
But I think it's
important that you know

1256
01:27:21,027 --> 01:27:23,075
I like to wear women's clothes.

1257
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:29,040
- Huh?
- I like to wear women's clothes.

1258
01:27:30,287 --> 01:27:33,257
Panties, brassieres, sweaters, pumps.

1259
01:27:34,332 --> 01:27:36,710
It's just something I do.

1260
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:40,764
Yes, I can't believe I'm telling
you this, but I really like you

1261
01:27:40,839 --> 01:27:44,594
and I don't want it getting
in the way down the road.

1262
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:48,772
Does this mean
you don't like sex with girls?

1263
01:27:48,847 --> 01:27:51,396
No, I love sex with girls.

1264
01:27:57,731 --> 01:27:59,699
Okay.

1265
01:28:01,318 --> 01:28:02,410
Okay?

1266
01:28:04,863 --> 01:28:06,991
Okay.

1267
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:22,347
You see, we thought that Mr. Lugosi
was insured through his union.

1268
01:28:22,422 --> 01:28:23,799
Isn't he?

1269
01:28:23,882 --> 01:28:26,635
No, they say
his eligibility ran out years ago.

1270
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:31,978
Look, Doctor,

1271
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:34,560
he doesn't have any money.

1272
01:28:34,684 --> 01:28:38,029
But I'll give you everything I've got,
a few hundred dollars.

1273
01:28:38,104 --> 01:28:42,530
That won't even begin to cover it.
He's gonna have to leave.

1274
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:50,042
Bela? Bela, wake up.

1275
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:54,163
I've got some great news.

1276
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:56,795
The doctor says you're all better,
you can go home now.

1277
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:00,093
Really?

1278
01:29:00,919 --> 01:29:02,637
I don't feel so great.

1279
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:06,599
No? Well, you look just peachy.

1280
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:09,515
And, uh, the tests came back fine.

1281
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:12,564
Come on, let's get up.

1282
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:15,817
Here we go.

1283
01:29:15,892 --> 01:29:19,112
Attaboy. Good.

1284
01:29:26,403 --> 01:29:28,405
Eddie,

1285
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:31,617
I want to make another picture.

1286
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:34,624
When are we going to
make another picture?

1287
01:29:34,744 --> 01:29:38,294
Oh... Soon, Bela. Very soon.

1288
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:48,975
This is so exciting.

1289
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:51,052
Another production.

1290
01:29:51,136 --> 01:29:53,104
Isn't it?

1291
01:29:53,179 --> 01:29:57,275
So, Eddie, shouldn't we
have a sound crew?

1292
01:29:57,684 --> 01:30:00,688
Uh, no, no, because this
is just second unit stuff.

1293
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:03,819
We're gonna do the main
footage later. All right?

1294
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:05,783
So, what's this scene about?

1295
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:07,949
Um...

1296
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:11,323
You're a very important
and respected man.

1297
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:14,209
And you're leaving your house,
you're in a hurry.

1298
01:30:14,284 --> 01:30:17,458
You're on your way to
a big social brouhaha. Okay?

1299
01:30:17,746 --> 01:30:21,250
Eddie.
What if I'm not in so big a hurry?

1300
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:24,257
What if I take a moment to slow down,

1301
01:30:24,336 --> 01:30:26,759
to savor the beauty of life,

1302
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:30,763
to smell a budding flower?

1303
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:33,766
That's great. That is great.

1304
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:36,018
Let's do a take. Okay?

1305
01:30:39,142 --> 01:30:40,985
Ed, I'm really busy.

1306
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:42,278
What do you want now?

1307
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:44,402
I was calling to see
if you'd like to attend

1308
01:30:44,481 --> 01:30:47,030
the world premiere of my new movie,
Bride Of The Monster.

1309
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:49,068
Didn't you just make one
called Bride Of The Atom?

1310
01:30:49,277 --> 01:30:50,449
Yes, it's the same film.

1311
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:52,906
But the distributor
wanted a punchier title.

1312
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:54,491
Come on, it's gonna be a big event,

1313
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:57,043
Bela, Tor and Cris are coming.
You'll have fun!

1314
01:30:58,828 --> 01:31:00,956
Uhh! I can't see.

1315
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:03,212
These contact lenses are hurting.

1316
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:05,544
My eyes are killin' me.

1317
01:31:05,794 --> 01:31:07,546
Don't worry. We're almost there.

1318
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:16,558
Hi.

1319
01:31:16,638 --> 01:31:20,643
Right in there. Thank God you're here.
They're tearing up the place.

1320
01:31:22,018 --> 01:31:24,112
Come on, come on.

1321
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:26,110
Come on, this way.

1322
01:31:28,441 --> 01:31:30,284
Come on!

1323
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:32,328
Come on!

1324
01:31:32,404 --> 01:31:34,623
I've never been to
a movie premiere before!

1325
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:48,803
Well, go knock 'em dead.

1326
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:03,602
Oooh!

1327
01:32:03,685 --> 01:32:05,779
<i>At the stroke of midnight,</i>

1328
01:32:06,062 --> 01:32:08,406
<i>the witching hour,</i>

1329
01:32:08,481 --> 01:32:11,030
<i>the ghouls arise</i>

1330
01:32:11,109 --> 01:32:12,986
<i>from the dead!</i>

1331
01:32:21,411 --> 01:32:24,381
- Hey, Vampira, how 'bout a little love!
- Fuck off!

1332
01:32:24,456 --> 01:32:27,710
One of them stole my wallet!

1333
01:32:33,006 --> 01:32:34,349
- I can't see!
- Get off me!

1334
01:32:34,424 --> 01:32:35,550
Let's go!

1335
01:32:35,633 --> 01:32:39,058
I gotta save 'em!

1336
01:32:39,137 --> 01:32:40,559
Get your heads down!

1337
01:32:40,638 --> 01:32:42,766
Come on, let's go!
We're getting the heck outta here!

1338
01:32:42,849 --> 01:32:45,227
Can't see!

1339
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:48,063
I can't see anymore!

1340
01:32:53,276 --> 01:32:56,029
Hey, come on! Let's split!

1341
01:33:04,162 --> 01:33:06,961
Taxi!

1342
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,087
Stop!

1343
01:33:08,166 --> 01:33:10,260
Get in! Come on!
Go on, get in!

1344
01:33:20,011 --> 01:33:22,514
Now, that was a premiere.

1345
01:33:31,189 --> 01:33:33,112
Eddie,

1346
01:33:33,191 --> 01:33:35,865
last night was quite a romp.

1347
01:33:35,944 --> 01:33:37,912
Did you see that kid
grab Vampira's boobies?

1348
01:33:37,987 --> 01:33:42,288
I envied him. Hell, I envied you, too.

1349
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:47,043
A girlfriend who would jump
in front of a car like that.

1350
01:33:47,122 --> 01:33:49,796
Yes, she is quite something.

1351
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:52,047
None of my wives would have.

1352
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:59,302
Eddie, I want to thank you.

1353
01:34:00,510 --> 01:34:03,309
These last few days have been

1354
01:34:03,388 --> 01:34:05,311
a good time.

1355
01:34:06,808 --> 01:34:08,731
You know, I just...

1356
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:11,939
- I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
- Ah.

1357
01:34:12,021 --> 01:34:13,944
No problem.

1358
01:34:14,023 --> 01:34:16,242
I know it by heart.

1359
01:34:23,116 --> 01:34:25,665
"Home.

1360
01:34:25,743 --> 01:34:28,747
"I have no home.

1361
01:34:29,581 --> 01:34:31,583
"Hunted.

1362
01:34:31,708 --> 01:34:34,086
"Despised.

1363
01:34:34,335 --> 01:34:36,679
"Living like an animal.

1364
01:34:36,754 --> 01:34:40,008
"The jungle is my home.

1365
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:42,014
"But I shall show the world

1366
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:45,347
"that I can be its master!

1367
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:49,276
"I shall perfect my own race of people.

1368
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:51,773
"A race of atomic supermen

1369
01:34:51,853 --> 01:34:54,356
"that will conquer the world!"

1370
01:34:57,942 --> 01:35:01,492
Uh, Mr. Lugosi, could I have
your autograph, please?

1371
01:35:01,571 --> 01:35:03,869
- Certainly.
- Why, that was incredible.

1372
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:06,201
<i>I mean,
you're just as great as you ever were.</i>

1373
01:35:06,284 --> 01:35:08,207
Better.

1374
01:35:08,286 --> 01:35:11,381
I am 74, but I don't know it.

1375
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:13,424
When the brain is young

1376
01:35:13,499 --> 01:35:17,094
the spirit is still vigorous.

1377
01:35:17,170 --> 01:35:19,969
Like a young man.

1378
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:24,394
"And left the planet Mars

1379
01:35:24,469 --> 01:35:26,221
"never to return again."

1380
01:35:26,346 --> 01:35:28,189
"The end."

1381
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:30,942
Mmm.

1382
01:35:33,853 --> 01:35:35,651
Wood Productions.

1383
01:36:32,495 --> 01:36:35,874
Hey, whose crazy idea was it
to bury him in the cape?

1384
01:36:35,957 --> 01:36:39,461
I heard it was in the will, it was how
he wanted to be remembered.

1385
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:17,081
Could you run it again?

1386
01:37:29,927 --> 01:37:32,851
- Mr. Wood.
- Huh?

1387
01:37:32,930 --> 01:37:35,854
Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds,
your landlord.

1388
01:37:35,933 --> 01:37:38,186
Could you please open up?

1389
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:40,271
One minute.

1390
01:37:42,065 --> 01:37:43,157
Yes?

1391
01:37:43,232 --> 01:37:47,408
Uh, Mr. Wood, you have bounced
your third and final rent check.

1392
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:50,452
I'm terribly sorry.

1393
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:52,875
My stockbroker must've transferred
the wrong account.

1394
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:54,918
Come on in.
I'll write you another check.

1395
01:37:59,207 --> 01:38:02,177
Ah! I see you're in the
picture business.

1396
01:38:02,251 --> 01:38:06,347
- Yes.
- I'm interested in the picture business.

1397
01:38:06,422 --> 01:38:07,844
My associates and I,

1398
01:38:07,924 --> 01:38:10,768
we wish to produce
a series of uplifting religious films

1399
01:38:10,843 --> 01:38:13,016
about the apostles.

1400
01:38:13,096 --> 01:38:16,191
But unfortunately,
we don't have enough money.

1401
01:38:16,432 --> 01:38:18,184
Well, raising money's tough.

1402
01:38:18,267 --> 01:38:21,237
No, our church has
enough money for one film.

1403
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:24,236
We just don't have enough for all 12.

1404
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:28,494
Well, you know what you do?

1405
01:38:28,611 --> 01:38:31,410
You produce a film in
a commercially-proven genre

1406
01:38:31,489 --> 01:38:32,529
and then after it's a hit,

1407
01:38:32,573 --> 01:38:35,053
you take the profits from that
and make the 12 apostles movies.

1408
01:38:35,243 --> 01:38:37,792
- Would that work?
- Absolutely.

1409
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:39,838
Let me show you something.

1410
01:38:41,666 --> 01:38:43,589
You see this script?

1411
01:38:43,668 --> 01:38:46,012
<i>Grave Robbers From Outer Space.</i>

1412
01:38:46,129 --> 01:38:48,427
Money in the bank.

1413
01:38:48,506 --> 01:38:50,474
Grave robbers from what?

1414
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:54,430
From outer space. It's science fiction.
Very big with the kids.

1415
01:38:54,512 --> 01:38:56,014
If you make this picture,

1416
01:38:56,097 --> 01:38:58,441
you'll have enough money
to finance 100 religious films

1417
01:38:58,516 --> 01:39:00,860
and pay my back rent with the profits.

1418
01:39:00,935 --> 01:39:05,190
I don't know.
This is all a lot to absorb.

1419
01:39:05,481 --> 01:39:07,233
It's a guaranteed blockbuster.

1420
01:39:07,316 --> 01:39:08,363
Mmm.

1421
01:39:09,318 --> 01:39:12,788
I understand this science fiction is
very popular, but,

1422
01:39:12,864 --> 01:39:15,959
don't the big hits
always have big stars?

1423
01:39:16,033 --> 01:39:20,004
- Well, we have a big star, Bela Lugosi.
- Bela Lugosi...

1424
01:39:20,079 --> 01:39:21,877
Oh, I thought he passed on.

1425
01:39:23,416 --> 01:39:26,044
Yes. Yes, he did.

1426
01:39:26,335 --> 01:39:27,962
But...

1427
01:39:30,715 --> 01:39:34,936
- I've got the last footage he ever shot.
- Doesn't look like very much.

1428
01:39:38,514 --> 01:39:42,690
Mr. Reynolds, this is the acorn
that will grow a great oak.

1429
01:39:43,728 --> 01:39:45,105
I'll just get a double
to finish his scenes

1430
01:39:45,188 --> 01:39:47,862
and we'll release it
as Bela Lugosi's final film.

1431
01:39:48,191 --> 01:39:50,489
Bunny? We're makin' another movie.

1432
01:39:50,568 --> 01:39:53,822
Yes, I got the Baptist Church of
Beverly Hills to put up the cash.

1433
01:39:54,989 --> 01:39:57,538
Ed, I got
the Lugosi doubles outside.

1434
01:39:57,617 --> 01:39:59,415
Bunny, I gotta go.

1435
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:06,463
He's too short.

1436
01:40:07,543 --> 01:40:09,511
He's too tall.

1437
01:40:10,588 --> 01:40:12,386
He's just not going to work.

1438
01:40:12,465 --> 01:40:16,686
Well, Ed, I was thinkin' like
when Bela played Fu Manchu.

1439
01:40:16,761 --> 01:40:19,139
- Paul, that was Karloff.
- Oh.

1440
01:40:19,222 --> 01:40:21,190
- You're gonna have to try harder.
- Okay.

1441
01:40:21,265 --> 01:40:23,359
- Try to be a cut above. Go get 'em.
- Okay. Right.

1442
01:40:23,434 --> 01:40:27,530
Keep Sunday open, the producers
want us to get baptized. Okay.

1443
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:37,202
You know, hon, when you rewrite a
script, it just gets better and better.

1444
01:40:38,449 --> 01:40:42,124
This is the ultimate Ed Wood movie.
No compromises.

1445
01:40:43,496 --> 01:40:45,294
Oh, my.

1446
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:47,713
- Eddie, look at this.
- Hmm?

1447
01:40:47,792 --> 01:40:50,045
What?

1448
01:40:50,127 --> 01:40:52,095
Poor girl's out of a job.

1449
01:40:56,133 --> 01:41:00,559
I brought the script. You'll be
portraying the ghoul's wife.

1450
01:41:00,638 --> 01:41:03,391
- The ghoul's wife?
- Yes.

1451
01:41:03,474 --> 01:41:06,193
You should feel lucky.

1452
01:41:06,269 --> 01:41:08,910
Eddie's the only fella in town who
doesn't pass judgment on people.

1453
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:12,484
That's right. If I did,
I wouldn't have any friends.

1454
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:16,825
Look, would it be possible to make the
ghoul's wife a little less prominent

1455
01:41:16,904 --> 01:41:18,281
so people wouldn't really
notice me in the movie?

1456
01:41:18,364 --> 01:41:19,911
You don't want to be noticed?

1457
01:41:19,991 --> 01:41:24,246
Yeah. How about this? What if I don't
have any lines? I'll play the part mute.

1458
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:26,797
- Mute?
- Hey, it's Dr. Tom.

1459
01:41:26,872 --> 01:41:29,591
- Dr. Tom! Hiya!
- Who's Dr. Tom?

1460
01:41:29,667 --> 01:41:32,762
- He's my chiropractor.
- Hey, Kathy. How are you?

1461
01:41:32,837 --> 01:41:35,761
- Fine, thanks.
- Well, look at you.

1462
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,763
You're looking in alignment today.

1463
01:41:37,842 --> 01:41:40,971
Well, actually, my neck
is a little funny.

1464
01:41:41,053 --> 01:41:43,602
Now, here, let me fix that.

1465
01:41:49,937 --> 01:41:51,860
Ooh!

1466
01:41:55,526 --> 01:41:57,199
My gosh!

1467
01:41:58,863 --> 01:42:00,831
Don't move.

1468
01:42:04,285 --> 01:42:06,583
It's uncanny.

1469
01:42:07,955 --> 01:42:11,050
Look at his head! It's uncanny!

1470
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:16,798
<i>Lift up your voice</i>

1471
01:42:16,881 --> 01:42:19,680
<i>And let us sing</i>

1472
01:42:19,759 --> 01:42:24,390
<i>Alleluia, alleluia</i>

1473
01:42:26,015 --> 01:42:27,767
He look nothin' like Bela.

1474
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:29,944
He's kinda got his ears.

1475
01:42:30,019 --> 01:42:32,363
Oh, look. Cover your face with this.

1476
01:42:34,231 --> 01:42:36,154
Oh. Now I can see it.

1477
01:42:36,233 --> 01:42:39,203
I want to suck your blood.

1478
01:42:39,278 --> 01:42:43,454
I want to suck your blood!

1479
01:42:43,532 --> 01:42:45,910
Let's hear you call
Boris Karloff a cocksucker.

1480
01:42:45,993 --> 01:42:47,586
Shh!

1481
01:42:48,663 --> 01:42:51,462
We want these Baptists
to like us. Please.

1482
01:42:51,707 --> 01:42:54,586
<i>Alleluia</i>

1483
01:42:54,835 --> 01:42:57,088
Brothers and sisters,

1484
01:42:57,213 --> 01:43:01,184
we reach now in the service
a joyous point

1485
01:43:01,258 --> 01:43:05,354
because we are going to bear witness
to the baptism of our new members.

1486
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:07,932
Why couldn't we do this in the church?

1487
01:43:08,015 --> 01:43:10,689
Because Brother Tor couldn't fit
in the sacred tub.

1488
01:43:11,185 --> 01:43:13,779
Welcome to the fold, brother.

1489
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:18,409
Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your personal savior?

1490
01:43:18,484 --> 01:43:19,531
Yes!

1491
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:23,205
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

1492
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,408
Amen.

1493
01:43:28,703 --> 01:43:31,673
Welcome to the fold, brother. Welcome.

1494
01:43:33,958 --> 01:43:35,960
Praise the Lord, brother.

1495
01:43:40,005 --> 01:43:42,975
Do you reject Satan and all his evils?

1496
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:44,973
Sure.

1497
01:43:45,052 --> 01:43:48,431
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

1498
01:43:54,854 --> 01:43:57,573
Praise the Lord, friends!

1499
01:43:57,648 --> 01:44:00,618
- Do you repent for all your sins?
- I do.

1500
01:44:00,693 --> 01:44:03,253
How do you do it? How do you get
all your friends to get baptized

1501
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:05,322
just so you can make a monster movie?

1502
01:44:05,406 --> 01:44:07,079
It's not a monster movie.

1503
01:44:07,158 --> 01:44:09,502
- It's a supernatural thriller.
- Come to Jesus, brother!

1504
01:44:25,843 --> 01:44:28,187
I can't believe this.

1505
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,613
- Ed, what am I gonna do here?
- What do you mean?

1506
01:44:45,696 --> 01:44:47,243
He has no hair.

1507
01:44:47,323 --> 01:44:50,418
Gee, I never noticed that.
Put a wig on him!

1508
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:54,539
Before we start shooting,
Mr. Wood, we have a few questions.

1509
01:44:54,789 --> 01:44:58,384
Yes. The script contains numerous
references to grave robbing.

1510
01:44:58,459 --> 01:45:00,336
Now, we find the concept of

1511
01:45:00,419 --> 01:45:03,047
digging up consecrated ground
to be highly offensive.

1512
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:04,723
It is blasphemy.

1513
01:45:04,799 --> 01:45:07,348
What are you talking about?
It's the premise of the movie.

1514
01:45:07,426 --> 01:45:09,306
It's the title of the movie,
for Christ's sakes!

1515
01:45:09,386 --> 01:45:10,808
Mr. Wood!

1516
01:45:10,888 --> 01:45:12,811
Yes, about that title.

1517
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:15,234
It strikes us as very inflammatory.

1518
01:45:15,309 --> 01:45:17,482
<i>Why don't we change it to
Plan 9 From Outer Space?</i>

1519
01:45:18,896 --> 01:45:21,570
Ha! That's ridiculous.

1520
01:45:24,235 --> 01:45:26,658
All right. And, action!

1521
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:32,493
Medical examiner been around yet?

1522
01:45:32,576 --> 01:45:35,955
Just left. The morgue wagon oughta
be along most any time.

1523
01:45:36,038 --> 01:45:39,542
- You get their statement?
- Yeah, but they're pretty scared.

1524
01:45:39,625 --> 01:45:42,003
Fine mess like this
will frighten anyone.

1525
01:45:42,086 --> 01:45:44,009
You have one of the boys

1526
01:45:44,088 --> 01:45:47,342
take the guy and the girl back to town,
you take charge.

1527
01:45:47,424 --> 01:45:50,348
What'd you give him all the lines for?
He's unintelligible.

1528
01:45:50,427 --> 01:45:53,180
Lugosi's dead and Vampira won't talk,
I had to give somebody the dialogue!

1529
01:45:53,264 --> 01:45:55,232
That is no answer!

1530
01:45:56,851 --> 01:45:58,774
What about glitter?

1531
01:45:58,853 --> 01:46:00,696
When I was a headliner in Paris,

1532
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:02,739
audiences always liked it
when I sparkled.

1533
01:46:02,815 --> 01:46:04,783
No!

1534
01:46:04,859 --> 01:46:06,782
- Cat's eyes!
- No!

1535
01:46:06,861 --> 01:46:08,784
Well, I'm going to need some antennae.

1536
01:46:08,863 --> 01:46:09,910
No!

1537
01:46:10,072 --> 01:46:12,450
You're the ruler of the galaxy!
Show a little taste!

1538
01:46:17,329 --> 01:46:19,548
See? No talking. Isn't he good?

1539
01:46:19,623 --> 01:46:22,547
- Cue Dr. Tom.
- Now?

1540
01:46:22,626 --> 01:46:24,628
Yes, now. Lurk him.

1541
01:46:30,968 --> 01:46:33,596
Be sure and keep your face covered.

1542
01:46:41,604 --> 01:46:44,653
Isn't it wonderful? Bela lives.

1543
01:46:44,732 --> 01:46:47,406
Doesn't it strike you as a bit morbid?

1544
01:46:47,484 --> 01:46:49,407
No. He would've loved it.

1545
01:46:49,486 --> 01:46:51,580
Bela's returned from the grave.

1546
01:46:51,655 --> 01:46:54,078
Just like Dracula.
Cue Vampira.

1547
01:47:06,962 --> 01:47:09,715
Cut!

1548
01:47:09,798 --> 01:47:12,802
Let's go down and find out
whose grave it is.

1549
01:47:12,885 --> 01:47:16,059
Oh, why do I always get hooked up
with these spook details?

1550
01:47:16,305 --> 01:47:18,148
Monsters, graves, bodies!

1551
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:20,188
Cue flying saucer.

1552
01:47:25,064 --> 01:47:27,192
And cut! Print. We're moving on.

1553
01:47:28,817 --> 01:47:31,070
- That was perfect.
- Perfect? Mr. Wood,

1554
01:47:31,153 --> 01:47:34,407
do you know anything about
the art of film production?

1555
01:47:34,490 --> 01:47:36,413
Well, I like to think so.

1556
01:47:36,492 --> 01:47:38,620
That cardboard headstone tipped over.

1557
01:47:38,702 --> 01:47:41,330
This graveyard is obviously phony.

1558
01:47:42,623 --> 01:47:44,625
Nobody will ever notice that.

1559
01:47:44,708 --> 01:47:47,587
Filmmaking is not about the tiny details.
It's about the big picture.

1560
01:47:47,670 --> 01:47:49,297
- The big picture?
- Yes.

1561
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:53,180
How about when the policemen arrived
in daylight, but now it's suddenly night?

1562
01:47:53,258 --> 01:47:56,137
What do you know? Haven't you
heard of suspension of disbelief?

1563
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:58,188
Reverend, I'm here.

1564
01:47:58,263 --> 01:48:01,142
- Oh.
- Who is he?

1565
01:48:01,225 --> 01:48:03,478
This is our choir director.

1566
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:06,029
He's gonna play the young hero.

1567
01:48:09,066 --> 01:48:12,115
Are you people insane?
I'm the director!

1568
01:48:12,194 --> 01:48:14,162
I make the casting decisions
around here!

1569
01:48:15,239 --> 01:48:17,162
I thought this was a group effort.

1570
01:48:17,241 --> 01:48:19,243
No!

1571
01:48:21,245 --> 01:48:22,747
No?

1572
01:48:22,997 --> 01:48:25,091
They're driving me crazy!

1573
01:48:26,583 --> 01:48:30,884
These Baptists are
stupid, stupid, stupid!

1574
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:36,640
Okay. I gotta calm down.

1575
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:38,687
Gotta calm down.

1576
01:48:40,973 --> 01:48:43,021
Gotta calm down.

1577
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:45,068
Take a deep breath.

1578
01:48:45,144 --> 01:48:47,112
Relax.

1579
01:48:52,609 --> 01:48:54,987
All right, everybody.
Let's get set up for scene 112.

1580
01:48:55,070 --> 01:48:58,119
Move the crypt stage left, and let's
get Tor's make-up effect ready.

1581
01:48:59,450 --> 01:49:00,827
Mr. Wood!

1582
01:49:00,909 --> 01:49:04,334
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm directing.

1583
01:49:04,413 --> 01:49:06,461
Not like that you're not!

1584
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:08,963
Remove that get-up immediately!

1585
01:49:09,043 --> 01:49:11,045
You shame our Lord.

1586
01:49:15,382 --> 01:49:18,261
That's it! I can't take it!

1587
01:49:25,934 --> 01:49:28,437
Take me to the nearest bar,
and make it snappy!

1588
01:49:38,781 --> 01:49:40,783
Imperial Whiskey.

1589
01:50:00,177 --> 01:50:02,851
Oh, my gosh.

1590
01:50:03,097 --> 01:50:04,849
Orson Welles.

1591
01:50:17,027 --> 01:50:19,405
- Excuse me, sir?
- Yes?

1592
01:50:19,488 --> 01:50:23,709
Um, well, I'm a young filmmaker
and a real big fan.

1593
01:50:23,951 --> 01:50:26,079
I just wanted to meet you.

1594
01:50:27,371 --> 01:50:29,590
My pleasure. I'm Orson Welles.

1595
01:50:29,665 --> 01:50:32,339
I'm, uh, Edward D. Wood, Jr.

1596
01:50:35,003 --> 01:50:37,222
What you working on?

1597
01:50:37,297 --> 01:50:41,018
Well, the financing just fell through
for the third time on Don Quixote.

1598
01:50:41,093 --> 01:50:43,061
You know, I can't believe it.

1599
01:50:43,137 --> 01:50:45,310
That sounds just exactly
like my problems.

1600
01:50:45,389 --> 01:50:46,515
It's the damn money men.

1601
01:50:46,890 --> 01:50:49,484
They never know who's a windbag
and who's got the goods.

1602
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:51,483
Then they all think they're directors.

1603
01:50:51,562 --> 01:50:52,779
Ain't that the truth?

1604
01:50:52,855 --> 01:50:55,233
Do you know that I've even had
producers re-cut my movies?

1605
01:50:55,315 --> 01:50:57,033
I hate when that happens.

1606
01:50:57,109 --> 01:50:58,827
And they're always trying
to cast their buddies.

1607
01:50:58,902 --> 01:51:00,825
It doesn't even matter if
they're right for the part.

1608
01:51:00,904 --> 01:51:04,659
Tell me about it. I'm supposed
to do a thriller at Universal

1609
01:51:04,741 --> 01:51:07,335
but they want Charlton Heston
to play a Mexican.

1610
01:51:09,830 --> 01:51:13,630
Ah, Mr. Welles. Is it all worth it?

1611
01:51:13,709 --> 01:51:16,212
It is when it works.

1612
01:51:16,295 --> 01:51:19,595
<i>You know, the one film of mine
where I had total control, Kane?</i>

1613
01:51:19,673 --> 01:51:21,846
The studio hated it

1614
01:51:21,925 --> 01:51:24,769
but they didn't get to touch a frame.

1615
01:51:25,387 --> 01:51:28,607
- Ed.
- Yes?

1616
01:51:28,682 --> 01:51:31,060
Visions are worth fighting for.

1617
01:51:31,143 --> 01:51:34,113
Why spend your life
making someone else's dreams?

1618
01:51:40,444 --> 01:51:43,789
Thank you, Orson.

1619
01:51:47,784 --> 01:51:49,081
- Mr. Reynolds.
- Yes.

1620
01:51:49,161 --> 01:51:51,880
We are gonna finish this picture
just the way I want it

1621
01:51:51,955 --> 01:51:53,878
because you cannot compromise
an artist's vision.

1622
01:51:53,957 --> 01:51:56,176
- But it's our money.
- And you're gonna make a bundle

1623
01:51:56,251 --> 01:51:59,221
but only if you shut up
and let me do things my way.

1624
01:51:59,296 --> 01:52:04,177
All right, gang. Actors in positions.
Let's finish this picture.

1625
01:52:14,144 --> 01:52:15,270
Action.

1626
01:52:25,239 --> 01:52:28,709
Wanna give him a hand? Keep rolling.

1627
01:52:46,343 --> 01:52:48,266
Now that's an alien.

1628
01:52:49,346 --> 01:52:50,893
Action.

1629
01:52:57,980 --> 01:53:00,699
- What plan will you follow now?
- Plan 9.

1630
01:53:00,774 --> 01:53:03,618
Plan 9? Ah, yes.

1631
01:53:03,694 --> 01:53:07,415
Plan 9 deals with
the resurrection of the dead.

1632
01:53:07,656 --> 01:53:11,331
Long-distance electrodes shot into
the pineal and pituitary glands

1633
01:53:11,410 --> 01:53:13,253
of the recent dead.

1634
01:53:13,870 --> 01:53:16,874
You know, maybe you guys were right.
"Plan 9" is a good title.

1635
01:53:17,082 --> 01:53:19,460
I want that lightning,
I want those two explosions

1636
01:53:19,543 --> 01:53:20,795
and I've got to have
more shots of the military!

1637
01:53:20,877 --> 01:53:21,924
Right.

1638
01:53:44,693 --> 01:53:46,320
And cut.

1639
01:53:46,403 --> 01:53:49,407
All right, friends.
Prepare for scene 32.

1640
01:53:49,489 --> 01:53:51,491
- Mr. Wood?
- Yeah?

1641
01:53:51,575 --> 01:53:55,751
- Where's the cockpit set?
- You're standing in it. Places!

1642
01:54:13,472 --> 01:54:15,850
But what if we develop
this solenite bomb?

1643
01:54:15,932 --> 01:54:17,934
Then we'd be a stronger nation, too.

1644
01:54:18,018 --> 01:54:20,191
"Stronger." You see?

1645
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:23,194
You see? Your stupid minds.

1646
01:54:23,273 --> 01:54:25,196
Stupid. Stupid!

1647
01:54:25,275 --> 01:54:27,277
- That's all I'm gonna take outta you!
- Oh!

1648
01:54:31,239 --> 01:54:32,536
Cut!

1649
01:54:32,616 --> 01:54:34,664
Action.

1650
01:54:41,041 --> 01:54:43,214
Greetings, my friend.

1651
01:54:43,293 --> 01:54:45,261
We are all interested in the future

1652
01:54:45,337 --> 01:54:50,309
for that is where you and I are going
to spend the rest of our lives.

1653
01:54:50,384 --> 01:54:52,352
And remember, my friend,

1654
01:54:52,427 --> 01:54:56,603
<i>future events such as these
will affect you in the future.</i>

1655
01:55:14,324 --> 01:55:16,497
And cut!

1656
01:55:17,661 --> 01:55:19,334
That's a wrap.

1657
01:55:36,346 --> 01:55:37,518
Oh!

1658
01:55:44,354 --> 01:55:46,277
I can't get it up. It's stuck.

1659
01:55:46,356 --> 01:55:49,326
Eddie, you're gonna be late
for your own premiere.

1660
01:55:49,401 --> 01:55:51,369
All right, forget it.

1661
01:55:55,866 --> 01:55:57,868
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1662
01:55:57,951 --> 01:56:00,545
<i>you are about to see
an extraordinary motion picture.</i>

1663
01:56:00,787 --> 01:56:05,008
<i>But before it begins, I think we
should all give a hand to the man</i>

1664
01:56:05,083 --> 01:56:08,462
<i>without whom we wouldn't
be here tonight.</i>

1665
01:56:08,545 --> 01:56:10,513
<i>Eddie, take a bow!</i>

1666
01:56:49,002 --> 01:56:51,346
<i>Thank you.</i>

1667
01:56:51,421 --> 01:56:54,641
<i>I just wanna say that this film</i>

1668
01:56:55,717 --> 01:56:57,640
<i>is for Bela.</i>

1669
01:57:47,602 --> 01:57:49,570
<i>The grief of his wife's death</i>

1670
01:57:49,646 --> 01:57:52,616
<i>became greater and greater agony.</i>

1671
01:57:54,401 --> 01:57:58,076
<i>The home they had
so long shared together</i>

1672
01:57:58,154 --> 01:58:00,282
<i>became a tomb.</i>

1673
01:58:00,365 --> 01:58:03,835
<i>A sweet memory of her joyous living.</i>

1674
01:58:05,370 --> 01:58:08,340
<i>The sky to which he had once looked</i>

1675
01:58:08,415 --> 01:58:11,589
<i>was now only a covering
for her dead body.</i>

1676
01:58:19,759 --> 01:58:23,764
<i>The ever-beautiful flowers
she had planted</i>

1677
01:58:23,847 --> 01:58:25,770
<i>with her own hands</i>

1678
01:58:25,849 --> 01:58:30,150
<i>became nothing more than
the lost roses of her cheeks.</i>

1679
01:58:33,523 --> 01:58:35,696
<i>Confused by his great loss,</i>

1680
01:58:35,775 --> 01:58:38,324
<i>the old man left that home</i>

1681
01:58:38,403 --> 01:58:40,747
<i>never to return again.</i>

1682
01:58:56,129 --> 01:58:58,177
This is the one.

1683
01:58:58,256 --> 01:59:01,055
This is the one I'll be remembered for.

1684
01:59:05,722 --> 01:59:08,646
Aw, gee, honey, I'm so happy for ya!

1685
01:59:08,725 --> 01:59:10,898
Say, let's get married.

1686
01:59:11,227 --> 01:59:13,696
- Huh?
- Right now. Let's go to Vegas.

1687
01:59:13,772 --> 01:59:16,446
But, Eddie, it's pouring,
and the car top is stuck.

1688
01:59:16,524 --> 01:59:18,276
Phooey! It's only a five-hour drive

1689
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:20,112
and it'll probably stop
by the time we get to the desert.

1690
01:59:20,528 --> 01:59:24,249
Heck, it'll probably stop by the time
we get around the corner. Let's go.

1691
01:59:26,576 --> 01:59:28,829
On!
