Eating is his hobby.

Straight up the stairs. I'm terribly busy.

1549
01:32:13,693 --> 01:32:18,693
A whole day wasted.
Goodbye to you both. Goodbye.

1550
01:32:20,199 --> 01:32:23,952
What happened?
Did we do something wrong?

1551
01:32:23,953 --> 01:32:26,454
I don't know, Charlie.

1552
01:32:26,455 --> 01:32:31,455
But I'm gonna find out.

1553
01:32:46,475 --> 01:32:49,394
- Mr. Wonka?
- I am extraordinarily busy, sir.

1554
01:32:49,395 --> 01:32:52,313
I wanted to ask about the chocolate.

1555
01:32:52,314 --> 01:32:56,234
The lifetime supply of chocolate?
For Charlie.

1556
01:32:56,235 --> 01:32:57,902
When does he get it?

1557
01:32:57,903 --> 01:33:00,238
- He doesn't.
- Why not?

1558
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:02,574
Because he broke the rules.

1559
01:33:02,575 --> 01:33:05,577
What rules?
We didn't see any rules, did we?

1560
01:33:05,578 --> 01:33:07,829
Wrong, sir! Wrong!

1561
01:33:07,830 --> 01:33:11,499
Under Section 37-B of the
contract signed by him...

1562
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:15,837
it states clearly that all offers
shall become null and void if...

1563
01:33:15,838 --> 01:33:19,007
and you can read it
for yourself in this copy:

01:33:19,008 --> 01:33:20,675
"I, the undersigned..."

[SPEAKING IN LATIN]

1568
01:33:33,272 --> 01:33:36,775
It's all there! Black and white!
Clear as Crystal!

1569
01:33:36,776 --> 01:33:39,194
You stole Fizzy-Lifting drinks!

1570
01:33:39,195 --> 01:33:43,031
You bumped into the ceiling
which now has to be sterilized!

1571
01:33:43,032 --> 01:33:45,283
So you get nothing!

1572
01:33:45,284 --> 01:33:46,785
You lose!

1573
01:33:46,786 --> 01:33:49,704
Good day, sir!

1574
01:33:49,705 --> 01:33:51,539
You're a crook.

1575
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:54,459
A cheat and a swindler,
that's what you are!

1576
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:56,628
How can you do this?!

1577
01:33:56,629 --> 01:34:00,465
Build up a little boy's hopes and
then smash his dreams to pieces!

1578
01:34:00,466 --> 01:34:02,467
You're an inhuman monster!

1579
01:34:02,468 --> 01:34:07,468
I said, good day!

1580
01:34:08,474 --> 01:34:11,643
Come on, Charlie.
Let's get out of here.

1581
01:34:11,644 --> 01:34:14,479
I'll get even
if it's the last thing I do.

1582
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:19,480
If Slugworth wants a Gobstopper,
he'll get one.

01:34:40,506 --> 01:34:45,506
Mr. Wonka?

WONKA: "So shines a good deed..."

01:34:59,316 --> 01:35:01,609
My boy.

1588
01:35:01,610 --> 01:35:03,111
You won!

1589
01:35:03,112 --> 01:35:05,196
You did it! You did it!

1590
01:35:05,197 --> 01:35:08,283
I knew you would!
I just knew you would!

1591
01:35:08,284 --> 01:35:12,704
Oh, Charlie, forgive me for
putting you through this. Please.

1592
01:35:12,705 --> 01:35:16,040
Come in, Mr. Wilkinson.
Charlie, meet Mr. Wilkinson.

01:35:16,041 --> 01:35:17,458
- Pleasure.
- Slugworthl.

1594

That's not Slugworth!
He works for me!

1595
01:35:20,212 --> 01:35:22,714
- Foryou?
- I had to test you, Charlie.

1596
01:35:22,715 --> 01:35:25,967
And you passed the test.
You won!

1597
01:35:25,968 --> 01:35:28,303
- Won what?
- The jackpot, my dear sir!

1598
01:35:28,304 --> 01:35:31,139
- The grand and glorious jackpot!
- The chocolate?

1599
01:35:31,140 --> 01:35:34,726
The chocolate, yes.
But that's just the beginning!

1600
01:35:34,727 --> 01:35:38,396
We have so much time
and so little to do!

1601
01:35:38,397 --> 01:35:40,481
Strike that. Reverse it.

1602
01:35:40,482 --> 01:35:42,650
This way, please!

1603
01:35:42,651 --> 01:35:43,318
We'll take the Wonkavator.

1604
01:35:43,319 --> 01:35:45,486
We'll take the Wonkavator.

1605
01:35:45,487 --> 01:35:50,487
Step in, Charlie.
Grandpa Joe, sir.

1606
01:35:55,831 --> 01:36:00,001
- This is the great glass Wonkavator.
- It's an elevator.

1607
01:36:00,002 --> 01:36:02,587
A Won kavator.
An elevator goes up and down.

1608
01:36:02,588 --> 01:36:06,299
But the Wonkavator can go
sideways, slantways, backways...

1609
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:07,467
CHARLIE: And frontways?

1610
01:36:07,468 --> 01:36:09,928
And any ways you can think of.

1611
01:36:09,929 --> 01:36:14,432
It'll take you to any room by pressing
one of these buttons. Any button.

1612
01:36:14,433 --> 01:36:17,852
Press a button, and zing!
You're off.

1613
01:36:17,853 --> 01:36:20,772
And up until now,
I've pressed them all.

1614
01:36:20,773 --> 01:36:23,024
Except one.

1615
01:36:23,025 --> 01:36:25,276
This one.

1616
01:36:25,277 --> 01:36:26,861
Go ahead, Charlie.

1617
01:36:26,862 --> 01:36:30,782
Me?

1618
01:36:30,783 --> 01:36:32,742
There it goes!

what's going to happen.

Faster! If we don't pick up speed,
we won't get through.

- Aha.

- Up and out.

This roof is glass.
It'll shatter in 1000 pieces!

- Probably.

It's the most wonderful place
in the world.

I'm pleased to hear you say that...

Who can I trust to run the factory,
take care of the Oompa Loompas for me?

1644
01:38:02,875 --> 01:38:04,375
Not a grownup.

1645

A grownup would do everything
his own way, nof mine.

That's why I decided long ago
that I had to find a child.

to whom I can tell all my
precious Candy-making secrets.

- That's why you sent the tickets.
WONKA: That's right.

The factory's yours.
You can move in immediately.

I want you to bring them all.
