1
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,040
14, 15...

2
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,953
16, prime...

3
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,315
18, prime...

4
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,393
20...

5
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,473
21...

6
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,993
22, prime...

7
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,496
West Virginia
Collegiate Institute

8
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,159
is the best school for
Negros in the state.

9
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,595
It's the only school
past the eighth grade

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
anywhere near here.

11
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,793
Isosceles.

12
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,873
Scalene.

13
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,632
Equilateral.

14
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,708
Rhombus.

15
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,677
Trapezoid.

16
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,831
Katherine's in the sixth grade.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,056
They want to
take her early.

18
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,718
Tetrahedron.

19
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,558
Dodecahedron.

20
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,416
They're offering
a full scholarship.

21
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,919
All you have to do
is get there.

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,829
Ms. Coleman...

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,711
why don't you solve
the equation on the board?

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,192
We took up a collection

25
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,679
amongst the teachers and such.

26
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,840
It's not a lot...

27
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,115
but it's enough
to help get you settled in.

28
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,509
That's more than kind,
Ms. Sumner.

29
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,776
If the product of two terms

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,870
is zero then common sense says

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,117
at least one of the two terms
has to be zero to start with.

32
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,192
So if you move all the
terms over to one side,

33
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,391
you can put the quadratics
into a form

34
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,708
that can be factored...

35
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,472
allowing that side
of the equation

36
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,560
to equal zero.

37
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,856
Once you've done that,
it's pretty straightforward

38
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,880
from there.

39
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,920
In all my years
of teaching...

40
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,393
I've never seen a mind like
the one your daughter has.

41
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
Katherine!

42
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,232
Hurry on now, love.

43
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,279
You have to go.

44
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,752
Let Mama tuck you in.

45
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,594
You have to see
what she becomes.

46
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,318
Okay,
try to turn it over now.

47
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,949
Katherine?

48
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,794
Mary!

49
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,280
Somebody!

50
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Katherine!

51
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,954
Quit staring off into space
and turn the damn car over.

52
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,269
I got it.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,149
I'm not deaf.

54
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,320
I wonder sometimes.

55
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,880
Here it goes.

56
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,790
Yeah,
it's the starter.

57
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,793
That is definitely the starter.

58
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,791
This starter is starting
to make us late.

59
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,400
We are all gonna
end up unemployed...

60
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,869
riding around in this pile
of junk to work every day.

61
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,798
You're welcome
to walk the 16 miles.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,991
Or sit in the back of the bus.

63
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,792
I won't do neither.

64
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,674
I'll hitchhike.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,353
Girls.

66
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,593
No crime in a
broken-down car.

67
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,998
No crime being Negro neither.

68
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,309
Button it up, Mary.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,389
Nobody wants to go to
jail behind your mouth.

70
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,080
I'll do my best, sugar.

71
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,229
Not a great place for three of
y'all be having car trouble.

72
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,440
We didn't pick the place,
Officer. It picked us.

73
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,113
You being disrespectful?

74
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,679
No, sir.

75
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,428
You have
identification on you?

76
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,079
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

77
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,116
We're just on our way
to work...

78
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,349
at Langley.

79
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,879
NASA, sir.

80
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,553
We do a great deal
of the calculating.

81
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,392
Getting our rockets
into space.

82
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,079
All three of you?
Yes, sir.

83
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,240
Yes, Officer.

84
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
NASA.

85
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,074
Now that's something.

86
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,474
I had no idea
they hired...

87
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,235
There are quite a few women
working in the space program.

88
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,911
Damn Russians are
watching us right now.

89
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,914
Sputniks.

90
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,077
You girls ever
meet those astronauts?

91
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,639
Mercury Seven?

92
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,239
Absolutely.

93
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,798
Uh, yes, sir. We work with
those gentlemen all the time.

94
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,150
Those boys are the best
we got. I'm sure of that.

95
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,355
Yeah.
Yeah.

96
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,216
We gotta get a man up there
before the commies do.

97
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,240
Yes.
Absolutely.

98
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,776
Whole damn country's
counting on them.

99
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,915
That's for certain.

100
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,638
Hard being of service
broken down

101
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,478
on the side
of the road, though.

102
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,352
Right, right.

103
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,192
Well, do y'all need a tow
or something?

104
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,960
No, thank you, Officer.
I think I got it.

105
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,189
Just give me my...

106
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,636
Just need to bypass
the starter.

107
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,996
She's good at this stuff.

108
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,750
Whoo! Attagirl.

109
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,880
We're all set.

110
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,429
Well, hell, least I can do
is give y'all an escort.

111
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,158
I imagine you're
running late to work.

112
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,992
No, sir. We wouldn't
wanna bother you.

113
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,440
That would be
wonderful, Officer.

114
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,994
Thank you so much, sir.

115
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,080
Follow me.

116
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
I'm driving.

117
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,016
Hurry up, Dorothy,
before he changes his mind.

118
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,190
- We're coming.
- Hold your horses.

119
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,096
Yes!
Whoa, slow down, Mary!

120
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,599
Mary, slow down!
You're too close!

121
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,816
Be quiet.
He said to follow him.

122
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,034
He didn't mean
up his behind!

123
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,311
Dear Lord, I don't even
know where to begin!

124
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,833
Oh, I'll tell you
where to begin.

125
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,634
Three Negro women are chasing
a white police officer

126
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,552
down the highway
in Hampton, Virginia...

127
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,551
1961.

128
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,554
Ladies, that there
is a God-ordained miracle.

129
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,672
And, tomorrow,
I'm riding the bus.

130
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,758
I'm moving over

131
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,509
I'm on a sidewalk

132
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,431
I'm going over

133
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,914
Lift off
is good. Trajectory is stable.

134
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,195
Show me.

135
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,514
No, exactly.

136
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,955
40.349110 degrees North.

137
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,354
Ascent angle 46. 56.

138
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,519
Approaching
7,400 miles per hour.

139
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,553
118 seconds.

140
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,072
Boosters have disengaged.

141
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,599
Second stage success.

142
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,400
Korabl-Sputnik 4 is orbital.

143
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,430
Orbital entry is established.

144
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,192
Russian orbital entry
is established.

145
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,794
Jim Webb.

146
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,559
Yes, Mr. President.

147
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,912
We certainly are, sir.

148
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,912
Uh, it looks like
they've achieved

149
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,353
at least one orbit, maybe two.

150
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,154
Chernushka is ready
to go again.

151
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,791
So is our comrade, Ivan,
a brave space traveler.

152
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,599
We have proven life can
be sustained in space.

153
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,830
Now we will be first
to send a human.

154
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,992
A damn dog
and a damn mannequin.

155
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,275
And then, a 1.6 megaton RDS-37
thermonuclear warhead...

156
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,150
drops down in the middle
of Des Moines.

157
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,720
Well, that's
a pretty big jump, sir.

158
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
What?

159
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,110
Just that...
Who the hell is he?

160
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,316
Paul Stafford,
our lead engineer, Mr. Webb.

161
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,680
I think what
he meant to say...

162
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,240
is that speculation, at least
on our side of the equation...

163
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,311
by definition can be...

164
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,118
just a little dangerous.

165
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,315
Dangerous?

166
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,948
You know what's dangerous,
Mr. Stafford?

167
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,156
Inaction and indecision.

168
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,950
The Russians
have a spy satellite

169
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,040
lapping the planet,

170
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,270
taking pictures
of God knows what!

171
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,789
The President is demanding
an immediate response.

172
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,520
No more delay.
Alan Shepard, John Glenn,

173
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,776
your uncle Bob,
it doesn't matter.

174
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,869
Get us up there, Harrison.

175
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,235
We can't justify
a space program

176
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,675
that doesn't put
anything in space.

177
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,471
How'd that feel
in there, Paul?

178
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,631
You think you enlightened
the administrator?

179
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
Hmm?

180
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,870
No, he didn't look
enlightened to me.

181
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,992
He look enlightened to you, Sam?

182
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,229
Not particularly.

183
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,469
And just so you know,

184
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,136
he's not wrong about
what he said in there.

185
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,559
You know that, right?

186
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,432
Because now that
they can get up there,

187
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,669
a bomb will follow.

188
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,675
It's what happens
to all our good ideas.

189
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,071
I imagine theirs too.
Where's...

190
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,714
Where's the machine?

191
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,880
Any day now,
Mr. Harrison.

192
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,157
Any day now.
Yes, sir.

193
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,669
What's it called?
The initials.

194
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,034
The IBM.

195
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,719
International Business Machines.

196
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,553
Space is a business.

197
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,557
I need a mathematician.

198
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,000
I'll put in
another request, sir.

199
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,280
"Another request."
Jesus Christ.

200
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,556
We don't have a single person
in this entire building

201
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,029
that can handle
analytic geometry?

202
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,240
That's what
I've been told.

203
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,496
Tell me something else, Ruth...

204
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,953
like we're gonna find
such a person

205
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,519
before the Russians
plant a flag

206
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
on the damn moon.

207
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,760
A real good time.

208
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,000
All right, Gloria.

209
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,680
You'll be with engineering,
building four.

210
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,875
Ladies, ladies.

211
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,576
If you're tardy,
you don't get an assignment.

212
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,696
If you don't get
an assignment,

213
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,789
you don't have a job.

214
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,149
Eleanor.

215
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,912
Data Reduction, building 202.

216
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,235
Data Reduction?

217
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,958
You're welcome
to join the charmers

218
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,593
in Magnetoplasma Dynamics.

219
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,909
Oh, no, ma'am.

220
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,475
Thank you.
Data Reduction is just fine.

221
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,153
Mm-hmm.

222
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,559
Mary.
Present.

223
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,154
The Mercury Seven prototype
has arrived for testing.

224
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,276
Mr. Zielinski's
requesting you

225
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,275
for permanent assignment.

226
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,759
Are you serious?

227
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,920
Get moving.

228
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,116
Ooh, thank you, Jesus.

229
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,395
Thank you, Jesus!

230
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,995
Oh, thank you. Mary, Mary.
Keep it inside.

231
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,512
Okay. I'm sorry, Dor.

232
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,273
All right, Ms. Late.

233
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,476
You will also be supporting
the east group.

234
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,319
Mrs. Mitchell.

235
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,436
We're on double-time
this morning, girls.

236
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,909
I need these calculations
before lunch.

237
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,353
Space Task Group
needs a computer, ASAP.

238
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,109
Someone with a handle
on analytic geometry.

239
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,110
We can't fill that position
out of the east group.

240
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,429
Permanent or temp?

241
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,955
Everything's temporary, Dorothy.

242
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,155
You have someone?

243
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,514
Yes, ma'am.

244
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,631
Katherine's
the gal for that.

245
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,950
She can handle any numbers
you put in front of her.

246
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,439
I'll check her credentials.

247
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,950
Didn't think I'd come
all the way down here.

248
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,838
Here. Finish passing
those out.

249
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yes, ma'am.

250
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,598
Mrs. Mitchell.

251
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
If I could...

252
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,709
My application
for supervisor, ma'am.

253
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,656
Was just wondering if they're
still considering me

254
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,033
for that position.

255
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,269
Yes.

256
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,510
Well, the official
word is no.

257
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,760
They're not assigning a permanent
supervisor for the colored group.

258
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,879
May I ask why?

259
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,519
I don't know why.

260
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,199
I didn't ask why.

261
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,918
We need a supervisor, ma'am.

262
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,071
We haven't had one
since Miss Jansen got sick.

263
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,593
It's been almost a year.

264
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,352
Things are working
just fine as is.

265
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,313
I'm doing the work
of a supervisor.

266
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,835
Well, that's NASA for you.

267
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,319
Fast with rocket ships,
slow with advancement.

268
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,150
Get those trajectory
calcs worked out.

269
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,952
We need them
for the Redstone test.

270
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,833
Mach one tunnel test.
T-minus one minute.

271
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,476
No shoe is worth your life.

272
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,789
One moment.

273
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,875
T-minus 10, 9...

274
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,314
8...

275
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,400
7...

276
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,273
6, 5, 4...

277
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,954
Shut it down.

278
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,033
If we alter the exterior
from smooth to corrugated...

279
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,794
the capsule might have
more stability.

280
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,236
But the friction,
it is under during re-entry...

281
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,597
Most shield erosion occurs

282
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,672
on the posterior side
abutting the retro-boosters.

283
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,834
Conclusion?

284
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,358
The area closest to the boosters

285
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,793
is closest to the heat.

286
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,910
Coupled with rising
temperature on re-entry...

287
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,672
the contact softens.

288
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,956
We could consider
another fastener

289
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,359
other than the bolts.

290
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,549
Yes.

291
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,955
Yes.

292
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,629
There is another opening

293
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,517
in the Engineer
Training Program.

294
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,875
Flat head rivets
would reduce wind drag.

295
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,759
Mary, a person
with engineer's mind

296
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,353
should be an engineer.

297
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,360
You can't be a computer
the rest of your life.

298
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,669
Mr. Zielinski...

299
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,992
I'm a Negro woman.

300
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,991
I'm not gonna entertain
the impossible.

301
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,639
And I'm a Polish Jew

302
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,711
whose parents died
in a Nazi prison camp.

303
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,917
Now I'm standing
beneath a spaceship

304
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,038
that's going to carry an
astronaut to the stars.

305
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,676
I think we can say we are
living the impossible.

306
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,198
Let me ask you...

307
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,793
if you were a white male,

308
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,393
would you wish
to be an engineer?

309
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,956
I wouldn't have to.
I'd already be one.

310
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,351
Skirts must be worn
past the knee.

311
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,715
Sweaters are preferred
to blouses.

312
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,915
No jewelry.

313
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,116
A simple pearl necklace
is the exception.

314
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,033
Your supervisor
is Mr. Al Harrison,

315
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,350
Director of
the Space Task Group.

316
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,791
You'll write research,
proof calculations, so forth.

317
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,758
Do not talk to Mr. Harrison
unless he talks to you.

318
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,034
Not many computers last
more than a few days.

319
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,236
He's been through a dozen
in as many months.

320
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,234
Come on, keep up.

321
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,233
Things move fast
around here.

322
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,879
Your clearance.

323
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,834
They've never had a colored
in here before, Katherine.

324
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,189
Don't embarrass me.

325
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,679
This wasn't emptied
last night.

326
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,558
I'm sorry, I'm not the...

327
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,754
custodian.

328
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,429
Excuse me, ma'am.

329
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,636
Mr. Harrison's computer
reporting.

330
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,479
Take the desk in the back.
I'll get you work in a bit.

331
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,037
Mr. Harrison won't warm up
to you. Don't expect it.

332
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,520
Do your work,
keep your head down.

333
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,280
Thank you.

334
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,512
Go on. Get settled.

335
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,840
Paul.

336
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,238
Why are we still
losing shingles

337
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,554
off the heat shield?

338
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,075
We're working with a prototype
of the capsule, Al.

339
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,056
Its lid is one third the
size of what it's going...

340
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,080
I get that.

341
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,673
So, what do we do with our
million dollar fan, Karl?

342
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,110
Turn it down?
No, Al. I don't think...

343
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,669
It was a joke.

344
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,917
Paul, if the heat shield
comes off...

345
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,760
what do you think happens
to our astronaut?

346
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,840
I know.

347
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,080
So we're gonna come up
with a solve, right?

348
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,320
Yes, sir.
We're working on it.

349
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,678
Ruth, what's the status
on that computer?

350
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,831
She's right behind you,
Mr. Harrison.

351
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,349
Does she handle
Analytic Geometry?

352
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,398
Absolutely.
And she speaks.

353
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,788
Yes, sir. I do.

354
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,558
Which one?
Both.

355
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,199
Geometry and speaking.

356
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,436
Ruth, get me the...

357
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,560
You think you...

358
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,056
You think you can find me
the Frenet frame

359
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,080
for this data?

360
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,514
Using the Gram-Schmidt...

361
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,676
Orthogonalization algorithm.
Yes, sir.

362
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,479
I prefer it over
Euclidean coordinates.

363
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,039
Okay, good.

364
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,120
Good, then I'm gonna need
it by the end of the day.

365
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,275
Yes.

366
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,589
I'm also gonna ask you

367
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,760
to check
Mr. Stafford's math

368
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,273
as well as others' on this floor

369
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,429
from time to time.

370
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
I can handle that, Al.

371
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,637
I'm sure you can, Paul.
I'm sure they all can.

372
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,279
But if that were the case

373
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,976
shingles wouldn't be flying
off the heat shield,

374
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
now would they?

375
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,877
Excuse me, could I have
everyone's attention

376
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,029
for a moment?

377
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,639
Thank you.

378
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,799
Just to be clear...

379
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,838
in 14 days, the Mercury Seven
will be here for training.

380
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,833
And I have no doubt in my mind
that they're going to be

381
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,831
asking us questions
about our work.

382
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,119
I think that's pretty reasonable

383
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,236
given we're putting a human
on top of a missile,

384
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,440
shooting him into space,

385
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,953
and it's never been
done before.

386
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,840
Because it's never been done,

387
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,309
everything we do between now
and then is gonna matter.

388
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,552
It's gonna matter
to their wives...

389
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,273
to their children.

390
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,080
I believe it's gonna matter
to the whole damn country.

391
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,109
So this Space Task Group
will be as advertised.

392
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,511
America's greatest engineering
and scientific minds

393
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,239
are not gonna have a problem

394
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,754
with having their work checked.
Are they, Paul?

395
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,195
No, sir.

396
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,271
Good. So let's have
an amen, damn it.

397
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,440
Amen.

398
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,150
Amen!

399
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,949
All right.

400
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,158
My numbers are spot on.

401
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,075
I will double check them, sir.
No problem.

402
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,560
Uh...

403
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,776
I'm not gonna be able to...
Work on what you can read.

404
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,553
The rest is classified.
You don't have clearance.

405
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,915
These are the numbers
Mr. Harrison gave me.

406
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,036
Yes, I'm absolutely...
Excuse me.

407
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,679
May I ask
where the ladies' room is?

408
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,348
Sorry. I have no idea
where your bathroom is.

409
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,639
Yes, sir.

410
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,197
Uh, yes, sir.

411
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,794
Summertime in
Virginia was an oven

412
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,110
All the kids eating
ice cream with their cousins

413
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,834
I was studyin' while you
was playing the dozens

414
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,514
Don't act like you was there
when you wasn't

415
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,318
Runnin' from the man

416
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,628
Runnin' from the badge

417
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,155
Don't act like you was there
when you wasn't

418
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,158
Runnin' toward our plans

419
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,673
And the judges hands

420
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,836
Don't act like you was there
when you wasn't

421
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,514
I know they say
you crawl before you walk

422
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,113
But in my mind I already jog

423
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,638
If I stand still
I cannot get far

424
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,436
They want the moon
I'm on Mars

425
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,833
Sometime my mind dives deep
when I'm runnin'

426
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,588
Together we'll fly
But no more runnin'

427
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,040
Ruth!

428
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,200
Yes, Mr. Harrison?

429
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,995
Ruth, where's that girl
with the numbers?

430
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,276
On a... break.

431
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,435
We take breaks now?

432
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,714
Sometime my mind dives deep
When I'm runnin'

433
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,400
I don't want no free ride

434
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,799
I'm just sick and tired
of runnin'

435
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,075
Together we fly
But no more runnin'

436
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,514
My God, where have you been?

437
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,869
Are you finished yet?

438
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,075
Uh...

439
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,832
Almost. He said
by the end of the day.

440
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,797
The end of the day around
here was yesterday.

441
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,474
I need those done first.

442
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,993
He wants those done first.
Okay.

443
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
Get going.

444
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,429
I'm sorry about that.

445
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,839
Somebody's working on it
right now.

446
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,749
Mr. Harrison.

447
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,591
Yeah. Uh, Just set it...
You know.

448
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,830
And Stafford's
heat shield calcs?

449
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,992
It's hard
to be sure, sir.

450
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,153
Hard to be sure.

451
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,638
You know
what we're doing here?

452
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,191
Trying to put
a man into space, sir.

453
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,554
That's right.

454
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,480
That's right. So you can
throw that in the trash.

455
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,914
Excuse me?

456
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,596
I said you can throw it away.

457
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,120
Here.

458
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,719
It's not an insult
to your work.

459
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,433
It's just obsolete.

460
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,830
That's how fast things
are moving around here.

461
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,355
If I said I was sorry,
I'd be saying it all day.

462
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,309
What I'm asking you to do,

463
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,960
what I'm asking everyone
in that room...

464
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,190
all my geniuses...

465
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,032
is to look
beyond the numbers.

466
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,876
To look around them.

467
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,678
Through them.

468
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,070
For answers to questions
we don't even know to ask.

469
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,916
Math that
doesn't yet exist.

470
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,829
Because without it,
we're not going anywhere.

471
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,752
We're staying on the ground.

472
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,480
We're not flying into space.
We're not circling the Earth.

473
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,358
And we're certainly not
touching the Moon.

474
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,714
And in my mind...

475
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,275
In my mind, I'm already there.

476
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,520
Are you?

477
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,229
Yes, sir.

478
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,388
Good.

479
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,936
Because I don't need
another smart girl

480
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,188
with an adding machine.

481
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,873
Can I go, sir?

482
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,958
Yeah, go.

483
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,639
Yes, you can go.

484
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,151
We've been waiting for hours.
Next time, you take the bus.

485
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,548
She's in a mood.

486
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,837
People talkin'
tryin' to break us up

487
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,118
Why won't they let us be?

488
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,754
Brick and stones
may break my bones

489
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,831
But talk don't bother me

490
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,037
I've been abused

491
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,559
In my heart

492
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,555
I haven't been late
one day in 10 years.

493
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,359
Haven't been out sick.
Haven't complained.

494
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,520
My work's on time.

495
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,999
It's done right.
It's done well.

496
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,513
It's not fair,
that's a fact.

497
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,193
What's not fair
is having

498
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,416
the responsibility
of a supervisor...

499
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,237
- but not the title or the pay.
- Mmm.

500
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,229
Watching you two move on.

501
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,997
Now, don't get me wrong.

502
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,720
Any upward movement
is movement for us all.

503
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,877
Just isn't movement for me.

504
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,040
Truth be told, Dorothy...

505
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,430
I don't even know
if I can keep up in that room.

506
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,874
I'll be back with
the computers in a week.

507
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,792
Or out of a job entirely.

508
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,995
Oh, please.

509
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,816
You're better with the numbers
than anyone in there,

510
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,920
Katherine, and you know it.

511
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,136
Just make that pencil move
as fast as your mind does...

512
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,639
you'll be fine.

513
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,677
And you,
have some respect.

514
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,478
Get your damn feet
off my dashboard.

515
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,680
This isn't your living room.

516
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,792
I sound like a supervisor,
don't I?

517
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,518
A mean old salty one.

518
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,511
Riddled with authority,
no question.

519
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,752
You don't mess
with Mrs. Vaughan.

520
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,439
Turn that music up.

521
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,120
Good night,
Katherine.

522
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,240
Bye, Kat.

523
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,320
Good night, ladies.

524
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,720
- See you in the morning.
- Bye.

525
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,560
Hey, baby.

526
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,789
Hello, Mama.

527
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,119
I was fixing to call
the National Guard.

528
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,909
Sorry, Mama.
New assignment.

529
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,877
Space Task Group.

530
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,031
Oh, my word.
That sounds important.

531
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,872
It's a promotion?

532
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,873
It might be
a slight promotion.

533
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,999
But you want the job, right?

534
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,478
I think so.

535
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,392
It's a challenge, but...

536
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,636
It's nothing you
can't handle, Katherine.

537
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,238
Thank you, Mama.

538
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,909
Are they asleep yet?

539
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,712
They're pretending to be.

540
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,030
- What are you doing?
- I don't...

541
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,872
They're not pretending
well enough.

542
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,960
Constance!

543
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,917
Thank you, Mama.
Love you.

544
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,433
This is my bed.
No.

545
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,520
Get off!

546
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,999
Go back to yours!
I'm oldest! No.

547
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,376
- What are you doing?
- Get off!

548
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,628
What are you doing?

549
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,360
It's not fair how Joylette
gets to sleep by herself

550
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,198
because she's the oldest.

551
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,793
Yes, it is fair.
No, it's not.

552
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,456
- Yes, it is.
- Nuh-uh.

553
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,710
Constance, Kathy, sit.

554
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,030
Now, I understand...

555
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,913
you want to be grown
and have your own space.

556
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,756
So, whoever sleeps
in that bed,

557
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,472
in Joylette's place...

558
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,392
will also do the dishes...

559
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,312
take out the trash...

560
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,436
and do all of
Joylette's chores.

561
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,429
That's okay. Never mind.

562
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,318
Yeah, she's not so
terrible to share with.

563
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,680
Okay.

564
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,159
Then don't let me
come home

565
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,276
and find you like
this again, you hear me?

566
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,908
You're supposed to been
asleep a long time ago.

567
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,593
We just wanted
to say goodnight.

568
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,320
You've been gone
for 300 hours.

569
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,636
I know. I work a
full-time job now.

570
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,313
You all know that.

571
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,078
I have to be Mommy and Daddy.

572
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,511
I miss your father
just as much as anyone.

573
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,475
He's with the angels.

574
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,596
Yes, he's with
all the angels.

575
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,432
And he's watching over us.

576
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,875
Every minute, okay?

577
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,429
That's why we have
to be strong.

578
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,520
All right?

579
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,953
Yes, Mama.
Yes, Mama.

580
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,473
Y'all get some rest, okay?

581
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,040
Mama?

582
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,120
Yes, baby?

583
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,029
Are the Russians fixin'
to attack us?

584
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,789
Where'd you
get that from?

585
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,480
We had to hide under
our desks today...

586
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,389
all scrunched up.

587
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,036
Okay, baby,
that's called a drill.

588
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,679
It means, uh...

589
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,319
you practice safety

590
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,789
just in case something happens.

591
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,233
Truth is, we don't know
what they're doing up there.

592
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,879
You going to space, too?

593
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,479
No, baby.

594
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,791
But I'm going to do
what I can

595
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,992
to help those brave men
get there. Yes, I am.

596
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,993
You could fly up to space
if you wanted to, Mama.

597
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,639
You could be an astronaut.

598
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,717
Did you draw this?
Yes, Mama.

599
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,031
Is that me?

600
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,200
Mmm-hmm.

601
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,069
You see this?

602
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,152
Oh, my goodness.

603
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,912
I love you, baby.

604
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I know.

605
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,559
Come here.

606
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,075
All right. Now this time
really go to bed.

607
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,680
Okay?

608
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,558
I love y'all.
Good night.

609
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,840
Good night.
Good night, Mama.

610
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,836
I love my picture, baby.

611
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,715
Thank you, Lord.

612
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,071
- Praise God!
- Praise God!

613
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,356
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!

614
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,520
Hallelujah.

615
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,359
Praise God...

616
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,079
that change is coming.

617
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,390
From the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference...

618
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,551
to the good reverend
Dr. King...

619
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,039
Amen!
Hallelujah!

620
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,395
...to the students sitting in
at lunch counters

621
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,480
in North Carolina.

622
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,640
That's right.
Yes, sir.

623
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,593
His faith in us
has no limit.

624
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,596
The good Lord
has our very own women

625
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,398
working on rocket ships.

626
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,597
And we have National Guardsmen

627
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,949
defending our freedom.

628
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,395
Give a shout of praise
for Colonel Jim Johnson.

629
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,071
Returning home,
by the grace of God

630
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,595
to set up
a National Guard unit

631
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,234
right here in Hampton.

632
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,673
Can I get a hallelujah in here?

633
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,831
Hallelujah!

634
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,479
I just don't understand.

635
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,633
I don't understand it.

636
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,440
I don't wanna talk
about this again, okay?

637
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,193
A female engineer?

638
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,360
A female engineer?

639
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,035
We're Negro, baby.

640
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,480
Ain't no such thing.
Understand it.

641
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,953
It's not like that
there, Levi.

642
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,439
You can't apply for freedom.

643
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,319
Freedom is never granted
to the oppressed.

644
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,993
It's got
to be demanded. Taken.

645
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,991
Stop quoting your slogans at me.

646
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,795
There is more than one way
to achieve something.

647
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,960
I don't want any greens.

648
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,956
Hey. I tell you
about interrupting?

649
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,792
Here. Try this, baby.

650
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,880
Yes.

651
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,757
You're gonna eat
them greens, too.

652
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,796
Kids need
to eat their vegetables.

653
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,678
You'd know that
if you was ever home.

654
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,951
You better settle down,
Levi Jackson.

655
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,792
Unless you want
this female's mind,

656
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,871
right here,
in front of everybody.

657
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,393
All I'm saying...

658
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,312
don't play the fool.

659
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,311
I don't wanna
see you get hurt.

660
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,391
NASA's never ever
given you guys your due.

661
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,913
Having a couple
of extra degrees

662
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,149
ain't gonna change that.

663
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,830
Civil rights
ain't always civil.

664
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,152
I don't want
any greens either.

665
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,355
No lip, little miss.

666
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,040
Your brother gets them,
and so do you.

667
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,395
I hear he's planning
on staying in the area.

668
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,751
Oh, yeah?
Well, that's good for him.

669
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,388
Katherine, go find
your way over there.

670
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,597
That Colonel Jim
is a tall glass of water.

671
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,034
That he is.

672
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,754
Tall, strong, commanding.

673
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,195
And I bet he's like that
day and night.

674
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,954
Mary, it's Sunday.

675
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,439
Please have some shame.

676
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,874
I will not.

677
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,068
Hmm, I think he's
smiling over here.

678
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,434
At you.

679
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,108
Well I'm not smiling back.

680
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,235
Yes, you are.
Oh, child.

681
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,151
You are all teeth right now.
I am not.

682
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,588
Come over here.

683
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,080
He's coming over.

684
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,576
Now, why would
he be doing that?

685
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,280
- 'Cause Mary's waving at him.
- No!

686
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,096
Ladies, I'm not ready.
It's too late. Fix your hair.

687
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,120
Hello, Colonel.

688
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,394
I'm Dorothy Vaughan.

689
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,696
That's Mary Jackson.
I believe you met her husband, Levi.

690
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,233
Yes, ma'am.
Good to meet y'all.

691
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,753
And Mrs. Katherine Goble.

692
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,717
She's not married.
She's a widow...

693
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,075
...with three beautiful
little girls.

694
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,240
So well behaved.

695
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,550
Angels on earth is what
we like to call them.

696
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,392
Dorothy, slice of pie?

697
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,073
I'd love one.

698
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,719
Excuse me.

699
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,056
You already have
a slice of pie...

700
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,080
Uh-huh.

701
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,399
I was just, uh, fixing my
three babies some plates...

702
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,794
Let me help you.

703
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,988
Sure.

704
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,151
Fruit salad.
Mmm-hmm.

705
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,518
Pastor mentioned you're
a computer at NASA.

706
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,600
Yes.

707
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,993
What's that entail?

708
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,600
Oh.

709
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,911
We calculate
the mathematics necessary

710
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,640
to enable launch and landing
for the space program.

711
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,309
That's pretty heady stuff.

712
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,515
Yes, it is.

713
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,398
They let women
handle that sort of...

714
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,480
Uh...

715
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,989
That's not what I mean.

716
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,479
What do you mean?

717
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,591
I'm just surprised
that something so...

718
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,714
taxing...
Mmm-hmm.

719
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,313
Mr. Johnson.

720
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,635
If I were you,
I'd quit talking right now.

721
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,028
I didn't mean
no disrespect.

722
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,554
I will have you know

723
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,790
I was the first
Negro female student

724
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,155
at West Virginia University
Graduate School.

725
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,108
On any given day...

726
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,390
I analyze the manometer levels

727
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,948
for air displacement,
friction, and velocity

728
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,594
and compute
over 10,000 calculations

729
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,398
by cosine, square root...

730
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,596
and, lately, analytic geometry.

731
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,680
By hand.

732
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,760
There are 20 bright,
highly capable

733
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,677
Negro women
in the West Computing Group.

734
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,314
And we're proud to be doing
our part for the country.

735
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,160
So, yes.

736
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,709
They let women do some things
at NASA, Mr. Johnson.

737
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,675
And it's not because
we wear skirts.

738
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,231
It's because
we wear glasses.

739
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,879
Have a good day.

740
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,194
Scott, welcome to Langley.

741
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,675
Welcome to Langley.
Welcome.

742
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,192
Good to have
you here, gentlemen.

743
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,554
Thank you.

744
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,399
That's Alan Shepard,
U.S. Navy pilot.

745
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,391
He could be the
first man in space.

746
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,239
And that's Scott Carpenter
and Walter Schirra...

747
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,958
also Navy pilots.

748
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,873
All under 5'11", 180 pounds.

749
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,632
IQs over 130.
Mmm.

750
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,711
And handsome must be
a requirement too.

751
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,599
How could you possibly be
ogling these white men?

752
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
It's equal rights.

753
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,871
I have the right to see
fine in every color.

754
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,190
And that's John Glenn.
He's the only Marine Corps pilot.

755
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,876
Gentlemen, if we may,
much to see around here.

756
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,960
Well, heck, we haven't
shaken all the hands yet.

757
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,640
We have a fairly tight
itinerary, Colonel.

758
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,720
Ruth, he's fine.

759
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,216
He's coming this way.
Look straight ahead.

760
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,240
I'm looking right at him.

761
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,392
Ladies, I didn't wanna run
off without saying hello.

762
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,073
Seem to be in a big
rush around here.

763
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,151
The Russians certainly
aren't slowing down any.

764
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,912
They can't build
a damn refrigerator.

765
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,600
How the heck did they
beat us into space?

766
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,216
And what do you ladies do
for NASA?

767
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,800
Calculate your trajectories.
Launch and landing.

768
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,976
You can't get anywhere
without the numbers.

769
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
No, sir.

770
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,956
Mary Jackson, Mr. Glenn.
Engineering.

771
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,576
And I'm proud as the devil
to be working with you.

772
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,749
Thank you, Mary.

773
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,840
John.

774
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,758
John, let's take it inside.
Yes, sir.

775
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,558
Guys.
Nice meeting you guys.

776
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,200
Thank you, Colonel.
Good luck, sir.

777
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,599
God bless you all.

778
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,794
Thank you. That's wonderful.

779
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,600
Thank you!

780
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,519
Mr. Harrison wants you
to confirm

781
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,319
launch and landing for the
Redstone rocket test.

782
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,551
I cannot work on what
I cannot see, Mr. Stafford.

783
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,789
It's illegible.

784
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,600
Those numbers have
already been confirmed

785
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,557
by two engineers in this
department and myself.

786
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,756
This is more or less
a dummy check.

787
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,360
You have one, we make it two.
Make it double, okay?

788
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,197
We gotta get it.
Just make it happen.

789
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,235
No one thought to measure
these things?

790
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,038
I'm afraid not, sir.

791
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,556
Well, would you
like us to stop?

792
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,711
No. No, just...

793
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,794
Actually, no.
Just keep going.

794
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,439
In fact, use the
big hammer.

795
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,600
Yes, sir.

796
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,856
Come on, use the big hammer.
You heard the man. Let's go.

797
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,880
Watch out.

798
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,920
Ma'am.

799
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,510
Our runner can pick up
your work, Dorothy.

800
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,152
You need to be working,
not walking.

801
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,596
Oh, it's break time, ma'am.
No trouble at all.

802
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,432
Since you made the trip...

803
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,716
you can take that batch
over there.

804
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,277
Sure thing, Mrs. Mitchell.

805
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,475
You need something else?
Yes, ma'am.

806
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,976
I was wondering if you know
what they're building

807
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
over in the tech wing.

808
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,950
It's called an IBM.

809
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,599
A mainframe machine.

810
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,833
Apparently, it can
do our calculations

811
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,000
in a fraction of the time.

812
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,680
Hmm.

813
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,952
I guess that's good for NASA.

814
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,476
Hurry on, now.
Best if you do it in one trip.

815
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,229
Excuse me.

816
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,440
Hi.

817
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,752
What are you
looking at, Paul?

818
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,513
Is that correct?

819
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,960
Yeah.

820
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,795
Whose work is that?

821
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,871
I said, whose work is that?

822
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,472
Katherine Goble, sir.

823
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,360
Hello.
Hi.

824
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,456
How did you know
the Redstone

825
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,038
couldn't support orbital flight?

826
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,376
That's classified information.

827
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,400
It's top secret.

828
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,235
It's no secret why the
Redstone tests keep failing.

829
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,879
It's fine
for sub-orbital flight

830
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,076
but it can't handle
the weight of the capsule

831
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,240
and push it into space.

832
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,393
Numbers don't lie.

833
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,311
And you figured
all that out with this?

834
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,911
Half the data is redacted.

835
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,156
But what's there tells a story
if you read between the lines.

836
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,000
The distance from launch
to orbit, we know.

837
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,354
Redstone mass, we know.

838
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,396
Mercury capsule weight, we know.

839
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,398
And the speeds are there
in the data.

840
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,238
You did the math.

841
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:32,640
Yes, sir.

842
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,271
I looked beyond.

843
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,749
How do you know
about the Atlas rocket?

844
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,751
That's not math.

845
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,989
That data is not here.

846
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,792
Like you said, it's classified.

847
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,757
I held it up to the light.

848
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,279
You held it up
to the light?

849
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,509
Yes, sir.

850
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,800
Well, there it is.

851
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,960
Mmm-hmm.

852
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,280
Atlas.

853
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,269
What's your name?

854
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,953
Katherine Goble.

855
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,633
Are you a spy, Katherine?

856
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,800
Am I what?

857
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,040
I said, are you a Russian spy?

858
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,473
No, sir.

859
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,993
I'm not Russian.

860
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,158
She's not Russian, sir.

861
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,791
All right then, we have
nothing to lose here.

862
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,016
Give her everything she needs

863
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,296
to work on Shepard's
trajectories.

864
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,390
Without redaction.
Are we clear on that?

865
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,834
Are we sure about this?

866
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,040
What's the issue, Paul?

867
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,633
You heard her.

868
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,800
She's not a spy.

869
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,232
I just don't think
it's a good idea.

870
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,075
You know what I think's
a good idea? Darker ink.

871
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,520
I think darker ink's
a good idea.

872
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,736
Ruth, could you
pass it along?

873
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,760
Yes, sir.

874
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,989
Thank you, Katherine.

875
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,309
Thank you, sir.

876
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,831
This interrogation's over.

877
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,550
You can probably get to the
moon and back with this.

878
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,119
Just not the bathroom.

879
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,430
At least they're not
blind of what you do.

880
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,680
It's not gonna matter soon.

881
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,474
This IBM's gonna
put us all out of work.

882
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,551
How you doing?
What can we do about it?

883
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,271
Only one thing to do.

884
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,158
Learn all we can,
make ourselves valuable.

885
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,216
Somewhere down the line,
a human being

886
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,536
is gonna have
to push the buttons.

887
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,959
That's right.

888
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,718
Oh, mercy.

889
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,472
Well, she must be lost.

890
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,856
NASA doesn't commission females

891
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,200
for the Engineer
Training Program.

892
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,109
That position is available
to any qualified applicant.

893
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,078
Right. Except, you don't have
the educational requirements.

894
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,309
I have a bachelor's degree

895
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,736
in mathematics
and physical science.

896
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,637
It's the same as most
engineers around here.

897
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,314
We now require advanced
extension courses

898
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,913
through the University
of Virginia.

899
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,275
It's in the employee
handbook. In addendum.

900
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,680
In case you haven't read it.

901
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,470
Every time we have a chance
to get ahead...

902
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:11,829
they move the finish line.

903
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,400
I just follow the rules
around here.

904
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,113
And I expect everyone
who works for me

905
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,240
to follow them as well.

906
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,597
There are no special
circumstances for anyone.

907
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,230
Y'all should be thankful
you have jobs at all.

908
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,550
"For those that cannot attend classes
at the University of Virginia...

909
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,109
"advanced extension courses
are available

910
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,077
"at the Hampton High School."

911
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,075
That's still a
segregated school, Mary.

912
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,708
Virginia acts like Brown
versus Board of Education

913
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,800
never happened.

914
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,275
They are never gonna
allow a colored woman

915
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,431
to just take classes
at an all-white school.

916
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,397
Well, sounds about right.

917
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,278
That's all you gonna say?

918
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,096
I'm not gonna sit here all day
and listen to you complain

919
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,314
about the way things are.

920
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,560
We're trying to play cards.

921
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,296
Petition the court.
Fight for what you want.

922
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,799
But quit talking about it.

923
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,438
I've been complaining?
For days.

924
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,600
Ladies.

925
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,916
Not one more peep
about work.

926
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,149
Deal me in.

927
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,280
Katherine?

928
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,719
- Come on.
- Oh, no.

929
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,909
Right here.
You.

930
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,957
Child, I needed this.

931
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,160
Thank you.

932
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,835
Don't give her
anymore, Katherine.

933
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,156
I can't. She drank it all.

934
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,595
Listen, I'm fine.

935
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,637
I'm as fine
as I have ever been.

936
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,592
You're drunk
as you've ever been.

937
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,513
Come on. Let's dance, ladies.

938
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,434
Come on, Kat. Let's dance.

939
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,920
Go and dance with her,
Katherine.

940
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,393
Come on.
Get out here.

941
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,595
Hide that.

942
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,776
We gonna teach you
how to dance.

943
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,800
You go ahead.

944
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,836
All right.
It's too low.

945
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,638
We gonna teach you
how to get a man.

946
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,631
- Teach me? What?
- That's right. Come on!

947
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,358
You got to know
how to dance.

948
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,999
Slow. Slow.
Come on.

949
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,116
Twirl it around.
Twirl, twirl.

950
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,436
Yes!
Twirl, twirl, twirl.

951
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,192
Whoo! Look at her,
Dorothy.

952
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,351
Can I win me one of those
fancy dance contests?

953
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,794
Whip it around.

954
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,376
Yeah, and on the outside.

955
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,674
Was it better than Mama's?

956
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,154
No, not really.

957
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,840
Segregation must go!

958
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,710
Segregation must go!

959
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,916
Segregation must go!

960
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,877
Segregation must go!

961
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,376
Don't pay attention
to all that.

962
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,880
We're not part
of that trouble. Go on.

963
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,875
"Mind. They must have done..."

964
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,549
We don't want any trouble
in here.

965
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,356
Oh, I'm not here
for any trouble, ma'am.

966
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,589
What are you here for?

967
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,400
A book.

968
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,915
You have books
in the colored section.

969
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,912
It doesn't have
what I'm looking for.

970
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,230
That's just
the way it is.

971
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,736
Go on, now.
You know better than this.

972
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,069
Get your hands off my boys!
Don't touch them.

973
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,032
You have a blessed day.

974
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,916
Separate and equal
are two different things.

975
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,634
Just 'cause it's the way,
doesn't make it right.

976
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,915
Understand?

977
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:26,960
Yes, Mama.

978
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,275
You act right, you are right.

979
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,078
That's for certain.

980
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,240
Understand?

981
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,435
Yes, Mama.

982
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,312
You took that book, Mama?

983
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,436
Son, I pay taxes.

984
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,631
And taxes pay for everything
in that library.

985
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,791
Can't take something
you already paid for.

986
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,950
"Fortran is a new
and exciting language...

987
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,476
"used by programmers
to communicate with computers.

988
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,950
"It is exciting, as it is
the wave of the future."

989
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,439
All right, everybody smile.

990
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,080
- Everybody smile.
- Aw!

991
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,480
Make a wish.
Make a wish.

992
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,119
Blow. Try again.

993
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,793
There you go.

994
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,951
Leonard, you need
to get you a job now.

995
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,080
Two jobs.

996
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,856
Your baby is nine.
What are you gonna do?

997
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,496
Thank you, man.
Yeah, you're just in time.

998
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,839
Look at that.

999
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,991
Look at what?
What a surprise.

1000
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,673
Can't complain, man.

1001
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,472
I'll say.

1002
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,671
Howard must have invited him.
Mmm-hmm.

1003
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,555
Let me go help them
with those flowers.

1004
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,151
Walter, you behave yourself.

1005
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,788
Now, you know,
I'm just... Yeah.

1006
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,398
That's right, baby.
Shake it.

1007
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,191
Yeah. There you go.

1008
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,195
Good to see you.
Yes. Thank you.

1009
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,876
I believe
I owe you an apology.

1010
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,509
Well, was that it?

1011
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,992
Can I make it
while we dance?

1012
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,600
I'm afraid I simply misspoke
the other day, Mrs. Goble.

1013
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,110
I've been away
for a long time.

1014
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,873
I imagine I'm just
out of practice.

1015
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,754
Mmm-hmm.

1016
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,794
I was hoping you'd allow
me to start over.

1017
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,240
Mmm-hmm.

1018
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,598
See, the thing is...

1019
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,680
I have an interest in
getting to know you better.

1020
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,280
Mmm-hmm.

1021
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,920
You're one
tough customer, huh?

1022
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,158
You haven't said
you're sorry yet.

1023
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,548
Right.

1024
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,755
Of course.

1025
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,757
I'm sorry, Katherine.

1026
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,109
For what, Jim?

1027
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,717
Underestimating you.

1028
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,397
And any other woman
like you...

1029
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,755
Though I don't imagine
there's many.

1030
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,950
That's good practice,
right there.

1031
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,736
We interrupt
this musical programming

1032
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,478
with breaking news.

1033
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,790
The Soviet news agency
has announced

1034
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,996
that Russian cosmonaut,
Yuri Gagarin,

1035
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,315
has become
the first man in space.

1036
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,480
Gagarin completed

1037
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,840
one full orbit
around the planet

1038
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,150
in 108 minutes.

1039
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,000
Stay tuned to this station
for more details

1040
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,479
as they become available.

1041
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,995
Guess that puts us
behind the curve.

1042
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,480
The Vostok-1 rocket...

1043
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,796
delivered Russian cosmonaut
Yuri Gagarin's 3KA capsule...

1044
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,837
into orbit, at 6:07 UTC...

1045
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:05,349
Reentering Russian airspace
at 7: 55 UTC.

1046
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,078
Proving conclusively that man

1047
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,798
could survive
orbital space flight.

1048
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,519
Gagarin was awarded

1049
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,016
the Order of Lenin
and a Gold Star...

1050
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,837
Well, they beat
the pants off us.

1051
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,115
Let's go.

1052
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,336
He is also conferred
the title...

1053
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,600
Let's learn how to fly
to space.

1054
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,875
"First Soviet Astronaut"...

1055
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,838
and has been proclaimed
a national hero.

1056
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,958
This is a day
of unprecedented triumph...

1057
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,872
for the Russian
space program

1058
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,270
and a crushing blow
for America

1059
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,351
in the race for space.

1060
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,351
I wanna thank everyone
for staying.

1061
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,670
I know it's late.
And after what I just saw,

1062
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,479
I'm sure everyone's probably
anxious to just go home.

1063
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,229
Before we do, I just
have to ask a question.

1064
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,717
The same one

1065
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,656
I've been asking myself
all the way over here...

1066
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,715
which is...

1067
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,079
How the hell did
we find ourself

1068
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,077
in second place
in a two-man race?

1069
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:56,880
Anybody?

1070
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:58,880
Paul?

1071
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,880
And I think Glenn said it
pretty well.

1072
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,120
They're just outworking us.

1073
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,430
The reason
I have to think that

1074
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,696
is because I refuse
to believe

1075
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,278
that the Russians
are smarter than us

1076
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,953
or that they have
more technology,

1077
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,553
or that they care more.

1078
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,111
But I don't know.
Is that possible?

1079
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,634
Is it possible
that it actually

1080
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,233
means more to them?

1081
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,911
We're in the fight
of our lives, people.

1082
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,389
We're not on
some epic joy ride.

1083
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,232
I just saw seven faces

1084
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,391
who aren't sure
that we can get there.

1085
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,717
This is our problem.

1086
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,073
And so as of right now

1087
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,056
there's only two things you
need to know going forward.

1088
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,593
One is staying here,
working late,

1089
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:45,920
that's gonna be
a fact of life.

1090
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,599
And two, don't expect
your paychecks

1091
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,256
to reflect the extra time
it's gonna take

1092
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,236
to catch up
and pass those bastards.

1093
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,736
For those of you
who can't work that way,

1094
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,115
I understand and thank you
for what you've done.

1095
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,759
For everyone else...

1096
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,995
I suggest
you call your wives

1097
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,559
and tell them
how it's gonna be.

1098
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,479
I'll start with mine.

1099
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,035
Sam, turn it up.
Turn it up.

1100
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,200
Yes, sir.

1101
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,038
John.
Morning, sir.

1102
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,032
7-5, 7-4, 7-3...

1103
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,673
End of the day.

1104
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:35,874
Okay, we're looking good.

1105
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,029
Okay.

1106
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,159
Sir, might be
the selector latch.

1107
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,508
I'm taking a walk.

1108
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,280
We're honored
to serve our country.

1109
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,670
So we don't think
about danger.

1110
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,831
We don't have time
to be scared.

1111
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,871
We got a job to do.

1112
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,070
Good morning.
Good morning.

1113
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,356
Mrs. Jackson.

1114
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,715
Colored seats are at the back
of the court room.

1115
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,233
Thank you, ma'am.

1116
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,277
So, which one of you
wants to go first?

1117
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:07,271
The IBM 7090
data processing system.

1118
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,630
It has the capability
of solving

1119
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,792
over 24,000 multiplications

1120
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,120
per second.

1121
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,992
Holy Moses,
that's lightning fast.

1122
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,360
They'll never
get that to work.

1123
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,756
Oh, it'll run eventually.

1124
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,960
And when it does, we have
to know how to program it.

1125
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,560
Unless you'd rather be
out of a job.

1126
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,119
No, ma'am.

1127
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,279
Mr. Z...

1128
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,792
I got a court date.

1129
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,159
"The computer uses it

1130
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,838
"as its high speed
storage unit,

1131
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,036
"an information
holding device."

1132
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,160
Hmm.

1133
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,154
You have a brain.

1134
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,833
That I can work with.

1135
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,511
This is in the wrong spot.

1136
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,191
Attagirl.

1137
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:05,480
Ruth.

1138
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,256
Yes, sir. Get me the
Cape on the line.

1139
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,111
Shepard's trajectories
need to be updated.

1140
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,035
Wow.

1141
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:15,949
Where is she?

1142
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,120
You and I are no
different from each other

1143
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,272
Shut our eyes
when we slumber I see numbers

1144
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:30,071
Black and white
we're computers, I am color

1145
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,440
Don't act like
you was there when you wasn't

1146
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,999
I don't want no free ride

1147
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,319
Some nights I cry

1148
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,436
'Cause I can
see the day comin'

1149
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,591
Together we fly

1150
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,994
Oh, but no more runnin'

1151
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,558
No more runnin'

1152
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,680
Where the hell
have you been?

1153
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,315
Everywhere I look, you're not
where I need you to be.

1154
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,629
It's not my imagination.

1155
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,916
Now where the hell
do you go every day?

1156
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,392
To the bathroom, sir.

1157
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:27,754
To the bathroom?

1158
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,549
To the damn bathroom.

1159
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,108
For 40 minutes a day?

1160
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,673
What do you do
in there?

1161
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,320
We're T-minus zero here.
I put a lot of faith in you.

1162
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:44,909
There's no bathroom
for me here.

1163
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,496
What do you mean there is
no bathroom for you here?

1164
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,875
There is no bathroom.

1165
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,759
There are no colored
bathrooms in this building

1166
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,876
or any building
outside the West Campus,

1167
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,319
which is half a mile away.

1168
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,520
Did you know that?

1169
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,636
I have to walk to Timbuktu
just to relieve myself.

1170
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,870
And I can't use
one of the handy bikes.

1171
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,951
Picture that, Mr. Harrison.

1172
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:08,789
My uniform...

1173
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,679
Skirt below my knees,
my heels,

1174
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,159
and a simple string of pearls.

1175
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:14,992
Well, I don't own pearls.

1176
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:16,957
Lord knows you don't pay
coloreds enough

1177
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,553
to afford pearls!

1178
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:23,553
And I work like a dog,
day and night,

1179
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,830
living off of coffee
from a pot

1180
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,399
none of you wanna touch!

1181
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,720
So, excuse me

1182
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,472
if I have to go
to the restroom

1183
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,312
a few times a day.

1184
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,159
There you have it.

1185
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:04,913
No more colored restrooms.

1186
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,230
No more white restrooms.

1187
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,992
Just plain old toilets.

1188
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,713
Go wherever
you damn well please.

1189
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,918
Preferably closer
to your desk.

1190
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:26,030
Here at NASA,
we all pee the same color.

1191
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,238
Heard you was
fighting the flu.

1192
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,118
Figured you could
use some soup.

1193
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,713
Hot meal for the girls.

1194
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,517
Come on in.

1195
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,959
Excuse me.

1196
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,554
Okay, ladies.
Let's say grace.

1197
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,113
Bow your heads.

1198
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,560
Dear Lord, thank you
for this meal.

1199
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,756
We ask that you
bless this food

1200
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,876
so that it may
bless our bodies.

1201
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:25,996
In Jesus's name we pray.

1202
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,558
Amen.
Amen.

1203
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,912
It's a historic day,
here at Cape Canaveral.

1204
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,399
And here's what we can expect.

1205
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:40,438
Alan Shepard and Freedom 7
will be launched into space

1206
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,273
at an altitude of about
116 miles an hour.

1207
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,316
Dorothy, come on, you gonna miss it!
Oh, boy! Go.

1208
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,656
- Come on, Dorothy.
- I'm coming.

1209
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,477
...then he will land
around 35 miles

1210
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:49,640
off the coast of Florida...

1211
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:50,955
where he'll be picked up

1212
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,496
by the men
of the USS Lake Champlain...

1213
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:53,520
Finally. Come over here.

1214
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,551
who set out
for this historic purpose.

1215
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,616
Freedom 7,
we're going to have to bleed off

1216
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,359
some of the pressure
inside the liquid oxygen tank.

1217
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,512
That should reduce the temperature
inside the capsule. Over.

1218
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,238
Any day now, CAPCOM.

1219
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,240
Fix your little problem
and light this candle.

1220
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:09,959
Roger that, Freedom 7.

1221
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:11,519
Stand by.

1222
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:12,896
Temperature is returning
to normal.

1223
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,876
Running one more
launch status check.

1224
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,109
All systems now go.

1225
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:17,799
Move to final countdown
sequence.

1226
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,473
Moving to final
countdown sequence.

1227
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:20,560
Roger that.

1228
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,799
We're at T-minus 10...

1229
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,549
nine...

1230
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:25,835
eight...

1231
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,314
seven...

1232
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,674
six...

1233
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,074
five...

1234
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,514
four...

1235
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:32,680
three...

1236
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,994
two...

1237
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,434
one...

1238
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,828
zero.

1239
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,348
We have ignition.

1240
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,314
And we have lift off.

1241
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,508
Get up there.

1242
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:46,910
Lift off,
and the clock is started.

1243
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,632
Fuel is go. 2.5G.

1244
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:54,869
Get on up there.

1245
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,234
- Come on!
- Lift off at

1246
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,197
34 minutes after the hour.

1247
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,995
Pitch 88.
Trajectory is good.

1248
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,552
Yaw is okay.

1249
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:27,517
Switching manual roll.

1250
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,671
Yes!

1251
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,636
For the eyes of the world

1252
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,916
now look into space,

1253
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:38,389
to the Moon
and to the planets beyond.

1254
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:39,480
Yes!
We did it!

1255
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:41,676
And we have vowed...

1256
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,195
that we shall not
see it governed...

1257
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,590
by a hostile flag
of conquest...

1258
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,511
but by a banner
of freedom and peace.

1259
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:53,879
We set sail on this new sea...

1260
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:57,316
because there is new knowledge
to be gained...

1261
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,357
and new rights to be won.

1262
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:02,434
We choose to go to the Moon
in this decade

1263
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,198
and do the other things...

1264
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,032
not because they are easy...

1265
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,997
but because they are hard.

1266
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,637
Suppose we should all
thank President Kennedy

1267
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,677
for the continued
job security.

1268
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,153
Uh, Gus Grissom's up next.

1269
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,830
Another suborbital flight
with a Redstone.

1270
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,749
It's our last shot

1271
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,239
before we strap Glenn
to the Atlas

1272
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:26,839
and pray we can bring him
back down.

1273
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,519
Yes, and I imagine
he'd like us

1274
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,352
to have the math
worked out beforehand.

1275
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,952
Good work, gentlemen.

1276
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,236
Go have dinner
with your kids

1277
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:37,958
and let's get
back to work.

1278
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:54,113
Look what you've done to me

1279
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:59,031
Make me behave like
I wouldn't ever

1280
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,391
I know you're the one for me

1281
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:07,114
Your essence is the ink
in the word "forever"

1282
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,068
I think it's high time that
I kissed you, Katherine.

1283
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,434
Oh, and why is that?

1284
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,552
Figured you attracted to me,
same as I to you.

1285
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,831
Is that right?
Mmm-hmm.

1286
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,108
Or you would have told me to
get going a long time ago.

1287
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:45,114
Haven't kissed a man
in a long time.

1288
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,599
Almost forgot how to.

1289
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,548
The FBI
has arrested four white men

1290
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:05,073
accused of throwing
a fire bomb

1291
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,593
into a Freedom Rider bus

1292
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,790
outside of Anniston,
Alabama...

1293
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,480
- Hi, babies.
- The bus filled rapidly

1294
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:11,776
Hi, Mama.
...with black smoke.

1295
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,028
We all hit the floor.

1296
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,430
All of us realized
the bus was on fire...

1297
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,670
and had to go out
into the mob.

1298
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,056
The kids don't need
to be watching this.

1299
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:20,399
They need to see this.

1300
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,120
When we got off the bus
in Birmingham...

1301
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,633
Everybody needs to see this.

1302
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,552
...took me and forced me
out of the door...

1303
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:26,869
and threw me into the crowd.

1304
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,634
And then I was beaten by one
big guy and several others.

1305
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,951
We think we're rendering
a great service to our nation.

1306
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,833
For this is not a struggle
for ourselves alone.

1307
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,873
It is a struggle
to save the soul of America.

1308
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,155
Mary Jackson.

1309
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,837
Petition to attend courses
at Hampton High School.

1310
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,679
Good morning, Your Honor.

1311
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,874
Hampton High School is
a white school, Mrs. Jackson.

1312
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,270
Yes, Your Honor.
I'm aware of that.

1313
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:01,152
Virginia,
still a segregated state.

1314
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,237
Regardless of what
the federal government says,

1315
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,590
regardless of what
the Supreme Court says,

1316
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,557
our law is the law.

1317
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:10,555
Your Honor, if I may.

1318
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,392
I believe there are
special circumstances

1319
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:13,480
to be considered.

1320
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,278
What would warrant
a colored woman

1321
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:16,360
attending a white school?

1322
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,032
May I approach
your bench, sir?

1323
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,160
Your Honor...

1324
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:36,398
you of all people
should understand

1325
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:37,953
the importance of being first.

1326
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,398
How's that, Mrs. Jackson?

1327
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,190
You were the first
in your family

1328
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,157
to serve in the Armed Forces.

1329
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:46,509
U.S. Navy.

1330
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:48,989
The first
to attend university.

1331
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,679
George Mason.

1332
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:53,035
And the first state judge
to be recommissioned

1333
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,549
by three consecutive
governors.

1334
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:57,392
You've done some research.

1335
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,159
Yes, sir.

1336
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,919
What's the point?

1337
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:02,399
The point is, Your Honor...

1338
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,755
no Negro woman
in the state of Virginia...

1339
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,269
has ever attended
an all-white high school.

1340
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,440
It's unheard of.

1341
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,192
Yeah. Unheard of.

1342
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,560
And before Alan Shepard
sat on top of a rocket,

1343
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,830
no other American
had ever touched space.

1344
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,316
And now, he will forever
be remembered

1345
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,909
as the U.S. Navy man
from New Hampshire,

1346
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,116
the first to touch the stars.

1347
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:25,989
And I, sir...

1348
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,674
I plan on being
an engineer at NASA,

1349
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,751
but I can't do that
without taking them classes

1350
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:32,592
at that all-white high school.

1351
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,080
And I can't change
the color of my skin.

1352
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:40,395
So I have no choice
but to be the first.

1353
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,151
Which I can't do
without you, sir.

1354
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,400
Your Honor...

1355
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,954
out of all the cases
you're gonna hear today...

1356
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,634
which one is gonna matter
100 years from now?

1357
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:54,233
Which one is gonna
make you the first?

1358
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,200
Hmm.

1359
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,072
Only the night classes...

1360
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,513
Mrs. Jackson.

1361
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,074
Yes, yes, yes!

1362
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:20,309
Yes!

1363
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,068
Oh, my God.
I cannot believe.

1364
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,656
How late did he say
he was gonna be?

1365
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,576
Excuse me.
No more than five minutes, sir.

1366
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,079
Gus Grissom's
coordinates.

1367
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:56,192
Uh, I'd like to get a jump
on John Glenn's trajectory.

1368
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,200
Do you have any idea
what you're asking?

1369
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:02,437
An orbital launch with an Atlas
rocket is going to take time.

1370
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,392
Is there a problem?

1371
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:06,914
Mr. Harrison...

1372
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,318
I was wondering.

1373
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,277
Uh-huh. I've been
wondering my whole life,

1374
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,998
so you just
spit it out.

1375
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,071
Well, sir...

1376
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:20,550
I would like to get a jump
on John Glenn's trajectory.

1377
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:21,776
This isn't about
plugging in numbers,

1378
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,000
it's about inventing the math.

1379
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,856
And I think you and I
talked about that, right?

1380
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:25,880
It doesn't exist.

1381
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,040
I can do it, sir.

1382
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,633
Do you have any idea
how exacting

1383
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,233
these calculations have to be?

1384
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,829
It's like shooting a sawed-off
shotgun from a thousand feet

1385
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,696
and getting that one BB through a
hole so tiny, you can't even see it.

1386
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:36,736
Okay, let me see
what you've got.

1387
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:37,840
I'm an excellent shot, sir.

1388
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,476
How have the
Grissom numbers been?

1389
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,559
They've been spot on.

1390
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,468
Give Glenn's orbit a go.

1391
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:49,696
But you run it all through
Stafford, you understand?

1392
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:50,720
Yes, sir.

1393
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,349
Thank you.

1394
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,278
Computers don't
author reports.

1395
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:07,674
CAPCOM,
this is Liberty Bell 7.

1396
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:08,760
Loud and clear.

1397
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,837
Okay, it's a nice
ride up to now.

1398
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Roger.

1399
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:16,716
Liberty Bell 7,
this is Hook 1 approaching.

1400
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:17,800
Ready to hook on. Over.

1401
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,190
I read you loud
and clear. Over.

1402
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,360
The hatch is blown,
CAPCOM.

1403
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,597
The Liberty Bell 7
capsule is taking on water.

1404
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,671
Gus Grissom
is out of the capsule.

1405
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,354
Rescuers are now going
to pull him

1406
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,440
from the ocean waves.

1407
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:35,673
Unfortunately, the Liberty
Bell 7 capsule is lost.

1408
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:36,880
Mama.

1409
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:39,800
I can't, I can't.
Mary.

1410
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:48,136
Mr. Harrison,

1411
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,480
taxpayer money
sank into the ocean

1412
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:50,794
along with your capsule.

1413
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:51,960
So what makes you think

1414
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,837
you can bring
John Glenn home safely?

1415
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Let me say first...

1416
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,480
discovery is never
just for the sake

1417
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,560
of discovery, gentlemen...

1418
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:59,750
but for the sake
of human survival.

1419
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,635
And it will always
come with a risk.

1420
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:06,310
Whoever gets there first
will make the rules.

1421
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,471
That's been true
of every civilization.

1422
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,639
And so, I think
the bigger question

1423
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,239
for this body
to consider is...

1424
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,995
who do you want calling
the shots in space?

1425
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:18,631
We have to know
what's out there, Senator.

1426
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:20,879
We have to touch the stars,

1427
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,269
if only to ensure
our own survival.

1428
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,271
And only a man can do that.

1429
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,559
We'll get
John Glenn home safely

1430
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,119
because we have to.

1431
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,315
Because he has to tell us
what he saw.

1432
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,871
The Redstone rocket
went straight up.

1433
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,312
But the capsule
didn't have enough speed

1434
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:42,920
to go into orbit,
so it came back down.

1435
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:47,110
Essentially a triangle.
Earth, sub-orbit, Earth.

1436
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,872
That math was known.

1437
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,548
That took Shepard,
took Grissom.

1438
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,913
That cannot take Glenn.

1439
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,472
Now, the Atlas rocket...

1440
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,077
that can push us into orbit.

1441
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:02,357
Goes up, delivers the capsule
into an elliptical orbit.

1442
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,958
Earth's gravity
keeps pulling at it

1443
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,759
but it's going so fast,
it keeps missing the Earth.

1444
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,672
That's how it stays in orbit.

1445
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,115
Now, getting it back down...

1446
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,552
that's the math
we don't know.

1447
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:17,640
Yes, Katherine.

1448
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,473
So the capsule will spin
around the Earth forever

1449
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,551
because there's nothing
to slow it down?

1450
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,280
That's right.

1451
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:27,398
Slowing it down at precisely
the right moment,

1452
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,152
at precisely
the right amount,

1453
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,320
that's the task.

1454
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:34,480
Yes, Katherine.

1455
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:38,076
So it needs to move
from an elliptical orbit...

1456
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,670
to a parabolic orbit.

1457
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:42,880
Yes.

1458
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,711
That's the "Go/No-go."

1459
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:47,836
Now at this point,
it's a pin head.

1460
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,993
We bring him in too soon...

1461
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:51,798
He burns up
on reentry.

1462
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,188
That's right.

1463
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:54,679
We bring him in
too late...

1464
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,432
he's pushed
out of Earth's gravity.

1465
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:59,910
And any changes to mass,
weight, speed, time...

1466
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:03,436
distance, friction,
or a puff of wind...

1467
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:06,396
would alter the "Go/No-go."

1468
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,518
And we start
our calculations over.

1469
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:10,920
Yes.

1470
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:16,435
So we need to be able to
choose this reentry point.

1471
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:19,592
Now this "Go/No-go,"
this has to be exact.

1472
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,795
Sam.

1473
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,556
These are the latest
Redstone numbers

1474
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:24,959
in current capsule data.

1475
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:26,678
Obviously, we know
the launch spot.

1476
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:27,760
Thanks.

1477
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,592
A Pentagon briefing
should illuminate

1478
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,398
where the Navy
needs the recovery zone.

1479
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,431
Then we work backwards
from there.

1480
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:37,715
And the rest is on us,
so let's get to work.

1481
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:39,440
Uh, Mr. Stafford.

1482
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:40,760
What, Katherine?

1483
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,153
If I could
attend the briefings,

1484
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,390
I'd be more useful
to the project.

1485
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,391
Pentagon briefings
are closed door.

1486
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,393
Yes, but if we don't
have the information

1487
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,799
of the changes...

1488
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:51,960
we can't keep up.

1489
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,456
I need those changes
as they occur.

1490
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:54,600
As you said,
it's a pin head.

1491
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,512
Katherine, that's the job.

1492
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:58,238
You asked for this assignment,

1493
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,390
so just calculate
with what you have.

1494
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,516
Or we'll find
someone who can.

1495
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:10,275
Okay.

1496
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:24,917
Attagirl.

1497
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,590
What the hell are you doing?
You can't be in here.

1498
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:28,795
Who are you?

1499
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,871
I'm with
the West Computing Group.

1500
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:33,348
Dorothy Vaughan, sir.

1501
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,238
This is a very delicate
piece of equipment.

1502
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,176
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm just trying to be helpful.

1503
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,430
Uh-huh.
Bill, we've got numbers.

1504
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,518
What kind of numbers?

1505
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:48,993
Well, I'll be.

1506
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,149
What's your name again?

1507
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,274
Dorothy Vaughan.

1508
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:55,913
Dorothy Vaughan.

1509
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,634
Sir, the parameters
for Friendship 7.

1510
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,393
Oh, this is all moot.

1511
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:09,391
We're altering the
window on the capsule.

1512
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,040
When did this happen?
Six minutes ago.

1513
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,639
The math is changing.
Start over.

1514
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,076
Sir, if I could attend the briefings,
I could stay current...

1515
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:17,719
Katherine, we have
been through this.

1516
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:18,880
It is not possible.

1517
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,616
There is no protocol
for women attending.

1518
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,789
There's no protocol
for a man

1519
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,160
circling the Earth either, sir.

1520
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,839
Okay. That is just
the way things are.

1521
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,593
Colonel Glenn's
launch coordinates,

1522
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:03,160
accounting for
the window change, sir.

1523
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,508
I have told you this.

1524
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,120
Computers don't
author reports. Fix it.

1525
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,356
Those are my calculations.
My name should be on it.

1526
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:10,431
That is not the way
this works.

1527
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,955
Paul. What's
happening here?

1528
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:15,270
Mr. Harrison, I would like
to attend today's briefing.

1529
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,509
And why is that?

1530
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:19,359
Sir, the data changes so fast.
The capsule changes.

1531
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:20,959
The weight and the landing zones

1532
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:22,553
are all changing, every day.

1533
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,950
I do my work, you attend
these briefings,

1534
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,040
I have to start over.

1535
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,511
Colonel Glenn launches
in a few weeks.

1536
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:30,600
We don't have the math
figured out yet.

1537
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,079
Why is it she can't attend?

1538
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:34,456
Because she doesn't
have clearance, Al.

1539
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:35,913
I cannot do
my work effectively

1540
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:37,360
if I do not have
all of the data

1541
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,635
and all of the information
as soon as it's available.

1542
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,456
I need to be in that room,
hearing what you hear.

1543
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,152
Pentagon briefings
are not for civilians.

1544
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:44,416
It requires
the highest clearance.

1545
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:45,456
I feel like
I'm the best person

1546
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:46,640
to present my calculations...

1547
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:48,736
You're not gonna let this go, are you?
No, I am not.

1548
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,716
And she is a woman.
There is no protocol

1549
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:51,936
for a woman
attending these meetings.

1550
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:53,279
Okay, I get that part, Paul.

1551
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:57,833
But within these walls,

1552
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,319
who makes the rules?

1553
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,993
You, sir. You are the boss.

1554
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,799
You just have
to act like one. Sir.

1555
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,309
You keep quiet.

1556
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,269
Thank you.

1557
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:19,269
Good morning.

1558
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:21,428
Gentlemen.

1559
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:31,440
This is Katherine Goble

1560
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,875
with our Trajectory
and Launch Window division.

1561
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,195
Her work is pertinent
to today's proceedings.

1562
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:39,440
Come on.

1563
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:41,874
Wanna get her a chair?

1564
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:44,856
We have a
confirmed launch window...

1565
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,200
Get her a chair, please.
Yes, sir.

1566
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:47,336
We have a
confirmed launch window

1567
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,475
for Friendship 7.

1568
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:49,800
Let's discuss a landing zone.

1569
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:52,669
The Navy needs
a singular landing zone.

1570
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:55,115
20 miles square is what we
can service for retrieval.

1571
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,320
Outside of that

1572
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,198
we risk the capsule's recovery.

1573
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,635
We'd like three possible
recovery areas.

1574
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,160
We can't cover
half the damn ocean.

1575
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:03,955
With all due respect,

1576
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,798
our capsule's being
altered daily.

1577
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:08,995
We're orbiting the Earth
at what speed now?

1578
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Uh...

1579
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,754
17,544 miles per hour...

1580
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,751
at the time the rocket
delivers the capsule

1581
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:21,074
into low space orbit.

1582
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:26,360
Well, that's one hell
of a speeding ticket.

1583
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:29,880
Okay.

1584
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,353
So we have
the vehicle's speed,

1585
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,555
the launch window...

1586
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:34,358
and for argument's sake,
the landing zone

1587
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:35,714
is the Bahamas.

1588
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,598
Should be enough
to figure the "Go/No-go"?

1589
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,239
Yeah, in theory, sir.

1590
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:40,992
We need to be past
theory at this point.

1591
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:42,838
We'll be able to
calculate a "Go/No-go"

1592
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:44,433
with that information.

1593
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,511
When exactly
is that gonna happen?

1594
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:57,960
Katherine.

1595
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,472
Have a go at it.

1596
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:32,628
The "Go" point for re-entry
is 2,990 miles

1597
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,639
from where we want
Colonel Glenn to land.

1598
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:39,070
If we assume
that's the Bahamas...

1599
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,710
at 17,544 miles per hour...

1600
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,468
upon re-entry...

1601
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:48,992
370 feet...

1602
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,318
at a descent angle...

1603
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:54,830
of 46.56 degrees.

1604
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:56,480
Distance...

1605
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:00,635
velocity squared, sine...

1606
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,995
gravity squared.

1607
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,554
Sine, 32 feet.

1608
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:11,273
And the distance would be...

1609
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:17,197
20,530,372 feet...

1610
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:23,037
or 2,990 miles...

1611
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:28,875
or 46.33 degrees.

1612
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:33,628
Okay, so that puts
your landing zone

1613
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:37,349
at 5.0667 degrees North...

1614
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,512
77.3333 degrees West.

1615
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,512
Which is here.

1616
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,072
Right here.

1617
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:50,356
Give or take
20 square miles.

1618
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:56,514
I like her numbers.

1619
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,194
Thank you.

1620
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:01,832
That, of course,
is assuming

1621
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:04,559
the capsule hits
the re-entry point exactly.

1622
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,196
How do we ensure that?

1623
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,911
That's the math we don't
have yet, gentlemen.

1624
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,833
We're working on it.

1625
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:15,229
Katherine.

1626
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,376
What's it gonna take to make
this thing worth the price tag?

1627
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:23,755
We're just getting up
to speed here, Mr. Harrison.

1628
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:24,915
I need more manpower.

1629
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,877
I need programmers,
folks to feed the cards.

1630
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:28,519
Get them,
for crying out loud.

1631
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:29,600
Okay.

1632
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,716
You're the IBM man, right?
Yes, sir.

1633
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:33,711
Go pull them out of the sky
if you have to.

1634
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:35,576
Let's get ahead of this thing
or I'm not paying you.

1635
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:36,828
Understood.

1636
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:42,190
I got that one,
I got that one.

1637
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:45,352
I'm not paying any of you.

1638
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:55,960
Me?

1639
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:57,758
Temporarily, yes.

1640
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:00,036
We need the IBM
for Glenn's launch.

1641
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:02,160
The lead engineer says
you're good with the cards,

1642
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:03,519
programming and such.

1643
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,752
What about the girls here?

1644
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,388
Human computers can't
calculate an orbital flight

1645
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:09,879
in the time we have.

1646
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:11,473
They'll stay put for now.

1647
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:13,312
What about after now?

1648
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,548
After Glenn's launch,

1649
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,949
NASA's dissolving
the computing groups.

1650
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:23,231
I'm not accepting reassignment

1651
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:25,311
unless I bring my
ladies with me.

1652
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:27,235
Excuse me?

1653
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:29,914
We're gonna need a lot of
manpower to program that beast.

1654
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:31,308
I can't do it alone.

1655
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:34,631
My gals are ready.
They can do the work.

1656
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,309
Ladies.

1657
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,352
We've been reassigned.

1658
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:45,909
Leave your calculators.

1659
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,513
You won't need them
where we're going.

1660
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:49,751
Welcome, ladies.

1661
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:02,070
You know
what your job is, Paul?

1662
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,590
Find the genius
among those geniuses.

1663
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:07,433
To pull us all up.

1664
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:10,397
We all get
to the peak together

1665
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:12,998
or we don't
get there at all.

1666
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:18,430
Yes.
Well, good night, sir.

1667
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:50,030
I don't know what time
I'm coming home.

1668
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:51,872
Class ends at nine.

1669
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,473
You got something to say?

1670
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:59,437
I thought
you might need these.

1671
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:05,070
You can refill them with
any weight lead you want.

1672
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:09,313
You see, you just
hit the top like this.

1673
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:12,151
All right?
The lead comes out.

1674
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:14,638
You put the new lead in...

1675
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:17,673
and new pencil.

1676
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:23,595
You gonna make a fine engineer.

1677
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:25,600
You think so?

1678
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:26,829
Yes.

1679
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:30,752
And nobody dare stand
in the way...

1680
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:33,354
of Mary Jackson's dreams.

1681
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:34,913
Myself included.

1682
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:42,590
Don't make me mad again.

1683
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:43,988
Yes, ma'am.

1684
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,591
And don't
make me late, either.

1685
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:51,280
You gonna be late.
I'mma make you late.

1686
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:52,879
You won't be late.

1687
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:00,509
All right, gentlemen.

1688
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:01,720
Tonight, we discuss

1689
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:04,951
Planck-Einstein
wavelength relationships.

1690
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,155
Yes?

1691
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:12,789
I'm Mary Jackson.

1692
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,313
I'm enrolled.

1693
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:18,631
Well, the curriculum
is not designed

1694
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:19,869
for teaching a woman.

1695
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,551
I imagine it's the same
as teaching a man.

1696
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:26,316
I don't see a
colored section.

1697
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:28,232
Should I just
take any seat?

1698
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:34,835
Thank you.

1699
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:41,472
Okay. Uh...

1700
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,319
Planck-Einstein.

1701
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:46,200
The problem...

1702
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:49,437
is when the capsule moves
from an elliptical orbit

1703
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:51,073
to a parabolic orbit.

1704
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,229
There's no mathematical
formula for that.

1705
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:56,874
Because we can calculate
launch and landing...

1706
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:58,393
but without this conversion

1707
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,915
the capsule stays in orbit,
we can't bring it back home.

1708
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:05,120
Maybe we've been thinking
about this all wrong.

1709
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:06,560
How's that?

1710
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,718
Maybe it's not
new math at all.

1711
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:16,432
It could be old math.

1712
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,715
Something that looks
at the problem numerically,

1713
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:21,358
and not theoretically.

1714
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:23,272
Math is always dependable.

1715
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:25,634
For you it is.

1716
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:34,475
Euler's method.

1717
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:35,789
Yes.

1718
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:38,030
But that's ancient.
But it works.

1719
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:40,312
It works numerically.

1720
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:17,669
That's it.

1721
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:21,348
Let's type it up.

1722
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:22,520
Okay.

1723
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:26,429
Huh.

1724
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:48,834
Dorothy.

1725
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:51,039
Mrs. Mitchell.

1726
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:59,191
You're working late today.

1727
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:02,515
Seems to always
happen that way.

1728
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:04,671
Yes. Seems to.

1729
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:13,520
Thank you.

1730
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:20,393
I hear the IBM's
up to full capacity.

1731
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:23,198
You certainly
have a knack for it.

1732
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:26,678
My father taught me a thing
or two about mechanics.

1733
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:29,755
You know, I have a few
girls in the East Group

1734
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:32,229
that have an interest
in learning more about it.

1735
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:33,515
It is the future.

1736
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:35,989
I may bring them by,
if it's all the same to you.

1737
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,552
That's not my
decision, ma'am.

1738
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:40,752
That would be
the supervisor's.

1739
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:43,438
Yes, that's true.

1740
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:47,272
Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.

1741
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:50,719
You know, Dorothy.

1742
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,351
Despite what you may think...

1743
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,755
I have nothing against y'all.

1744
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:59,109
I know.

1745
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:02,430
I know you
probably believe that.

1746
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:16,280
Good night,
Katherine.

1747
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:18,475
Good night.

1748
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:22,438
Mama!
Hey, babies.

1749
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,431
Mama.
Hi.

1750
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:26,269
Hey.

1751
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:29,479
Oh, please don't tell me
I missed someone's birthday.

1752
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:30,640
No, you didn't.

1753
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:31,869
No, you didn't, Mama.

1754
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,638
Madame, your seat.

1755
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:35,552
Well, thank you.

1756
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:38,471
Wait, is it my birthday?

1757
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:39,789
No, Mama.

1758
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:42,479
You all look so pretty.

1759
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:47,835
Mama, what's going on?

1760
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,313
Good evening, Katherine.

1761
01:35:58,320 --> 01:35:59,600
So you're not gonna
say anything?

1762
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:01,193
It's not my place.

1763
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,228
You, either?

1764
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:09,076
Okay, I'm not gonna
do this all night.

1765
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,479
Oh, mother of mercy.

1766
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:15,200
That's for me.

1767
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:20,636
Are you sad, Mama?
No.

1768
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:23,030
It's okay, Mama.
He's a good man.

1769
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:24,952
I know.

1770
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:26,416
I just can't help it.

1771
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:28,192
He hasn't even
asked you yet.

1772
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:31,157
I know, but he is.

1773
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:32,320
You are, right?

1774
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:33,708
If y'all will let me.

1775
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:35,996
Well, go on.
She's already crying.

1776
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:37,513
Oh, hush.

1777
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:38,720
This was my mother's ring.

1778
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,953
It's beautiful.

1779
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:43,160
She and my father
were married for...

1780
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:44,548
For 52 years.

1781
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:48,550
Figure it's about as lucky
a ring as you can get.

1782
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,470
The day I met you,
I called my mother

1783
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:55,712
and I said, "Mom, I met the
woman I want to marry."

1784
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:57,074
What'd she say?

1785
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:58,776
She said, "She must be
something, Jimmy.

1786
01:36:58,800 --> 01:36:59,800
"Really something."

1787
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,069
Then what'd you say?

1788
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:02,468
I said, "No.

1789
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:05,557
"She's more than something.

1790
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:07,233
"She's everything."

1791
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:09,080
Now...

1792
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:11,478
I planned on this being
more romantic.

1793
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:12,896
I'll make that
up to you real soon.

1794
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:13,989
It's okay.

1795
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:17,072
But I know marrying you

1796
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,592
includes marrying
your girls as well.

1797
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:23,079
Amen to that.

1798
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:24,760
I do.

1799
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:26,751
I didn't ask you yet.

1800
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:28,035
Hurry up.

1801
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:32,392
Oh, my goodness.

1802
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:34,240
Oh!

1803
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:39,115
My babies. Look, girls,
isn't it beautiful?

1804
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:41,195
Look, Mama.

1805
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:45,000
The
Mercury-Atlas space vehicle...

1806
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:46,160
which will put John Glenn,

1807
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:47,800
the first American,
into Earth's orbit...

1808
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:51,031
has already undergone
five unmanned flight tests.

1809
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:52,200
NASA has confirmed

1810
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:55,033
that the IBM 790
data processing system...

1811
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,350
has been utilized to confirm
all of the mission 's...

1812
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:59,795
launch and recovery
system calculations.

1813
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:01,720
The modifications
and equipment installations

1814
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:03,074
are progressing on schedule.

1815
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:04,958
Yes, sir. Right in here.

1816
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:07,640
You wanted
to see me, sir?

1817
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:08,800
Have a seat.

1818
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:11,592
Is there something wrong,
Mr. Harrison?

1819
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:13,318
No, there's nothing wrong.

1820
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:16,877
In fact, our IBM
is churning out numbers

1821
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,110
in fractions of the time
any human can.

1822
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:20,952
Present company included.

1823
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:23,119
That's good then.

1824
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,149
Maybe.

1825
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:29,640
The thing is,
the Cape's now insisting

1826
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:32,035
on doing all the backups
down there, on site.

1827
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:34,280
I see.

1828
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,311
So we won't be
running backups here.

1829
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:40,313
And truth be told, we can't
keep up with that IBM anyhow.

1830
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:45,511
Long story short,
we no longer need

1831
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,158
a computer in this department.

1832
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:50,671
Progress
is a double-edged sword.

1833
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:58,309
Let's have you report back
to the West Group for now.

1834
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:00,277
We'll see if we can find
another assignment.

1835
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,313
Thank you, sir.

1836
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:07,200
Katherine, I'm...

1837
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,952
I'm sorry about this.

1838
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:14,190
It's out of my hands,
if you can believe that.

1839
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:16,794
I understand.

1840
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:41,040
Katherine.

1841
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:44,872
We heard you got engaged.

1842
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:46,080
Yes.

1843
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:47,994
That's thoughtful of you.

1844
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:56,839
They're lovely.

1845
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,831
Mr. Harrison's idea, really.

1846
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:02,358
Although I suspect his
wife did the picking out.

1847
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:05,353
Can't imagine he has an eye
for anything but numbers.

1848
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:08,239
Now you have
a great wedding.

1849
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,751
You did good work
around here, Katherine.

1850
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:43,096
Hello there.
Good to see you.

1851
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:44,720
Hi, Reverend. How you doing?
How are you?

1852
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:49,157
I don't think I felt a thing
the first time I did this.

1853
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:50,799
I was so nervous.

1854
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:54,016
You're just
as beautiful

1855
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:55,189
as you were back then.

1856
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:56,992
- You think so?
- Mmm.

1857
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:59,119
Just a little older.

1858
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:01,550
And a little fuller.

1859
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:02,959
But you look good.

1860
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:09,231
Well, here we go. Again.

1861
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:10,776
Project Mercury...

1862
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,153
named after the winged messenger

1863
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:14,674
of the gods in
Roman mythology. Today,

1864
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:17,320
three years, two months,
and three days afterwards...

1865
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:19,456
we're ready,
after 10 scheduled attempts...

1866
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:20,959
Attagirl.

1867
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:22,997
to try again to put
our first man into orbit...

1868
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:24,798
to put Colonel John Glenn
into orbit.

1869
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:27,440
Colonel John Glenn will be the
first American to orbit the Earth.

1870
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:29,040
As you can see, there are

1871
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:30,360
thousands of people here today

1872
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:32,311
to witness this historic event.

1873
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:34,833
Paul, something's off here.

1874
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,150
These landing coordinates
don't match yesterday's.

1875
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:40,839
The IBM just ran them.

1876
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:43,791
Well, then the IBM
was wrong yesterday.

1877
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:45,515
Right?

1878
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:47,839
Or the damn thing's wrong today.

1879
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:53,790
Paul, am I right?

1880
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:56,198
It appears so.

1881
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:00,999
The IBM's been spot-on
up to this point, John.

1882
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:03,196
But we'll run it again,
see what it comes up with.

1883
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:05,078
Look, I'm gonna be
honest with you, Al.

1884
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:07,196
When I fly,
I fly the machine.

1885
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,715
And right now it seems like
this machine is flying me.

1886
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:11,040
We're on the same page, John.

1887
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:12,354
Our guys are on it.

1888
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:14,312
Let's get the girl
to check the numbers.

1889
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:16,832
- The girl?
- Yes, sir.

1890
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:19,829
You mean Katherine?

1891
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,991
Yes, sir. The smart one.

1892
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:24,549
I mean, she says they're good,
I'm ready to go.

1893
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:26,880
All right. We'll get into it.

1894
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:28,268
Roger.

1895
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:31,360
Sam.

1896
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:33,719
Go find Katherine Goble.

1897
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:36,075
She needs to verify
Glenn's "Go/No-go,"

1898
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:37,440
or we're staying
on the ground.

1899
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:38,709
Yes, sir.

1900
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:04,118
I'm looking for Katherine Goble.

1901
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:05,469
It's Katherine Johnson now.

1902
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:07,280
They need you to verify
these coordinates.

1903
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:10,959
...and tourists have poured
into Cocoa Beach for weeks.

1904
01:43:11,120 --> 01:43:13,156
Took this whole area
surrounding Cape Canaveral

1905
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:14,759
and Florida, really.

1906
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:17,150
And all around the country,
it's as if time...

1907
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:19,390
All right, give her
some space. Let her work.

1908
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:23,235
...as we await
Colonel John Glenn's launch.

1909
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:25,311
A truly historic day
for America.

1910
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:28,278
The country has waited
for several months,

1911
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:31,477
through many failed unmanned
Atlas rocket tests

1912
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:34,638
and 10 scheduled
manned attempts...

1913
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,870
which were canceled
for various mechanical

1914
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,791
or system complications.

1915
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:39,880
Even the weather...

1916
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:41,616
All the final tests and checks

1917
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:42,755
are being conducted.

1918
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:45,639
John Glenn is ready to board
the Friendship 7.

1919
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:48,030
But today we remain
truly optimistic,

1920
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:50,509
and it's a "Go" day
in all regards.

1921
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:52,272
The capsule is ready.

1922
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:54,158
The rocket itself is A-Okay,

1923
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,117
and the weather here
at Cape Canaveral...

1924
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:58,475
Anything from Langley?
Not yet.

1925
01:43:58,640 --> 01:43:59,789
We are being told

1926
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:01,473
that Mission Control at NASA

1927
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:03,870
is conducting
a final check of the launch

1928
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,149
and recovery coordinates.

1929
01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:07,834
Including the "Go/No-go"
calculations...

1930
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,000
so crucial

1931
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:10,800
to a safe and successful
launch and recovery.

1932
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:13,520
After years of
waiting, and months of delay,

1933
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:16,712
Colonel Glenn is finally ready
for that space flight...

1934
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:19,000
that we've been waiting for
with so much anticipation.

1935
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:20,976
These last-minute
checks could indicate

1936
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,877
a hesitancy on NASA's behalf.

1937
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,520
But let us say,
without reservation...

1938
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:27,197
that the safety
of Colonel John Glenn

1939
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:28,560
is paramount to the mission...

1940
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,513
and to the nation itself.

1941
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:31,829
No, sir.
We're still a go.

1942
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:33,554
Yes, sir.

1943
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:38,320
That's it.

1944
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:45,120
What the devil are you doing?
Are you taking a break?

1945
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:50,514
Yes!

1946
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:53,031
Say yeah

1947
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:54,355
Yeah

1948
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:56,719
Say, yeah!

1949
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:58,560
Yeah

1950
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:04,230
Don't you know,
we never ever

1951
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:07,235
Never know
what makes us major

1952
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:11,199
Your and my alchemy

1953
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:12,395
Yes, we can

1954
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:15,239
One and one equals three

1955
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:16,549
Yes, we can

1956
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:18,830
I feel it like lightning
in the forest

1957
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:20,400
Yes, we can

1958
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:23,239
Pick a number, pick a note
Harmonize the chords

1959
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:25,470
You're my woman
don't need another

1960
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:27,240
Get behind the other
We can lift each other

1961
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:29,589
It's all very well
that we may never...

1962
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:30,760
Whoo!

1963
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:33,919
Do you have the time?

1964
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:36,315
Yes, we can

1965
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:38,630
Like a solar system
they're surrounded by you

1966
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:40,400
Yes, we can

1967
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:43,075
Pick a number, pick a note
Harmonize the chords

1968
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:45,231
You're my woman
don't need another

1969
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:47,231
Get behind the other
we can lift each other

1970
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:49,436
...It's all very well
that we may never...

1971
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:50,720
Whoo!

1972
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:52,992
You're my woman
Don't need another

1973
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:55,435
Get behind the other
We can lift each other

1974
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:58,075
Whoo!

1975
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:06,480
Sir.

1976
01:46:11,080 --> 01:46:12,115
Pad 14.

1977
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:25,160
Katherine.

1978
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:31,440
Come on.

1979
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:36,911
Sir, we've got
Pad 14 on the box.

1980
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:38,680
All right.
Let me in there.

1981
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:44,634
This is Langley, we have
the coordinates confirmed.

1982
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,320
Stand by, Langley.

1983
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:49,760
We can confirm...

1984
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:52,793
the "Go/No-go" point
for re-entry is...

1985
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:58,318
16.11984 degrees latitude...

1986
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:04,032
-165.2356 degrees longitude.

1987
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:06,998
The launch window is a go.

1988
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:09,151
The landing coordinates match.

1989
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:10,952
That is very good news, Al.

1990
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:14,280
It's a little hard to trust something
you can't look in the eyes.

1991
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:15,839
That's right, Colonel.

1992
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,718
Katherine did manage
to calculate

1993
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:19,996
a few decimal points further
than that hunk of metal.

1994
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:22,637
I will take every digit
you got.

1995
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:23,840
Be sure to thank her for me.

1996
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:26,192
Gentlemen,
let's launch this rocket.

1997
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:27,679
Good luck, Friendship 7.

1998
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:29,319
Godspeed, Langley.

1999
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:34,039
Here
at Cape Canaveral...

2000
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:35,758
the countdown has resumed...

2001
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:37,478
as Colonel John Glenn...

2002
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:39,238
is now aboard
the Friendship 7...

2003
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:41,755
high above the
Atlas rocket on Pad 14.

2004
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:44,516
A height of over 93 feet.

2005
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:45,760
So far, the countdown is...

2006
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:48,229
These are pictures
from Cape Canaveral, Florida.

2007
01:47:48,440 --> 01:47:50,510
The gantry is now moving back.

2008
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:52,398
We are go for launch.

2009
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:55,154
The Mercury
spacecraft umbilical is out.

2010
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:58,036
T-minus 10 seconds,
and counting.

2011
01:47:58,240 --> 01:47:59,496
Water systems, go.
Mercury capsule, go.

2012
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:00,576
Eight, seven...

2013
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:02,431
Six, five...
Ready engine. Start.

2014
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:03,696
four...

2015
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:05,870
three, two...
Good Lord, ride all the way.

2016
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,196
One, zero.

2017
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:09,554
Ignition.

2018
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:11,709
Lift off.

2019
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:18,076
The M-A 6 vehicle
has lifted off.

2020
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:22,560
It's getting
a little bumpy along here.

2021
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:24,790
Roger that.
You are in Max Q.

2022
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,439
Roger that, CAPCOM.

2023
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:28,471
All systems
are reported go.

2024
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:30,119
20 seconds to SECO.

2025
01:48:30,280 --> 01:48:32,191
The trajectory
is still A-Okay.

2026
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:33,435
Go for SECO.

2027
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:37,079
Roger that, CAPCOM.
Go for SECO.

2028
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:44,154
Zero G and I feel fine.

2029
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:47,114
John Glenn reports
everything looks good.

2030
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:50,434
Oh, that view is tremendous!

2031
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,956
Roger that, Friendship 7.

2032
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:00,757
You are go for orbit.

2033
01:49:00,920 --> 01:49:02,399
Thank you, CAPCOM.

2034
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:09,750
All right.
Ten and a half hours to go.

2035
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:11,353
If we make seven
round trips.

2036
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:14,119
I could use a coffee.

2037
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:17,956
Well, as we
approach the end of the day

2038
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:19,638
here on
the Eastern Seaboard...

2039
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:22,519
Colonel Glenn is just
beginning his third orbit...

2040
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:25,194
three-quarters of the way
across the African continent.

2041
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:26,952
We see he's currently
over Zanzibar...

2042
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:29,628
which is the next
tracking station coming up.

2043
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:31,950
Thankfully,
the F riendship 7 capsule is...

2044
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:42,313
New assignment
came down the pike.

2045
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:48,035
Always changing
around here.

2046
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:50,111
It's hard to keep up.

2047
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,176
Seems like they're going
to need a permanent team

2048
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:56,031
to feed that IBM.

2049
01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:57,633
How big of a team?

2050
01:49:57,800 --> 01:49:59,711
Thirty, to start.

2051
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:04,710
Thank you for the information,
Mrs. Mitchell.

2052
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:09,318
You're quite welcome,
Mrs. Vaughan.

2053
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:24,675
Hmm.

2054
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:55,713
We have a warning light.

2055
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,356
CAPCOM 7,
I have a warning light.

2056
01:50:58,520 --> 01:50:59,669
Stand by, Seven.

2057
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:02,231
Sir, we have a warning light.

2058
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:07,273
What are we
looking at, Paul?

2059
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:08,475
Uh...

2060
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:10,596
The heat shield
may have come loose.

2061
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:12,830
Seven, will you confirm
the landing bag

2062
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:13,920
is in the off position?

2063
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:16,439
Affirmative, CAPCOM.

2064
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:17,919
Al, we need
to get him down now.

2065
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:19,798
He could burn up
on re-entry.

2066
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:30,591
Come on, babies.

2067
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:31,875
There is a man in space.

2068
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:33,576
And we don't want to miss it,
so we gotta hurry.

2069
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:35,272
Something's wrong
with Glenn!

2070
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:36,800
What's going on?
Come on, let's go.

2071
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:39,075
Come on. Hurry up, now.
Y'all follow me.

2072
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:42,630
We just learned
that the Friendship 7...

2073
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:45,798
is in danger of losing
its heat shield.

2074
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:47,996
Have you heard
any banging noises...

2075
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:49,798
or anything of this type
at higher rates?

2076
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:51,313
That is a negative, CAPCOM.

2077
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:53,277
This poses a grave danger
to the mission.

2078
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:57,228
Tell them not to jettison
the retro-package.

2079
01:51:57,760 --> 01:51:58,816
NASA is confirming there is

2080
01:51:58,840 --> 01:51:59,989
some sort of malfunction

2081
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:01,256
with the capsule's
heat shield...

2082
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:03,589
and it may not stay in place.

2083
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:05,756
If the heat shield's loose...

2084
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:09,276
the retro-package straps
might hold it in place.

2085
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:10,475
Will that work?

2086
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:12,312
It will work.

2087
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:15,040
It will hold it until he
reaches the "Go/No-go" point.

2088
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:16,200
It will work.

2089
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:20,359
Al, he has
to override the.05G.

2090
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:21,520
Do it.

2091
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:23,033
Friendship 7...

2092
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:26,033
we're recommending
that the retro-package not...

2093
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:28,270
I repeat, not be jettisoned.

2094
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:32,314
This means that you will have
to override the. 05G switch.

2095
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:33,480
Roger.

2096
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:35,989
Is there a reason
for this? Over.

2097
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:37,160
Stand by, Seven.

2098
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:43,669
Not at this time, Seven.

2099
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:46,473
Roger that, Command.

2100
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:49,154
I will make
a manual.05G entry...

2101
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:51,669
and bring the scope in. Over.

2102
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:56,514
He knows.

2103
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:05,840
Without a heat shield...

2104
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:07,760
there is no way that
Colonel Glenn can get back

2105
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,016
through the Earth's atmosphere.

2106
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:10,712
The heat is simply
too overpowering.

2107
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:13,550
A malfunction in the automatic
control system...

2108
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:16,991
is causing the spacecraft
to yaw in a skid-like fashion.

2109
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:18,832
Thus putting the Friendship 7's

2110
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:21,195
re-entry point in jeopardy.

2111
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:24,716
Even now, Colonel Glenn is streaking
toward the United States.

2112
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:27,348
And he must begin
the retro-sequence

2113
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:29,271
300 miles west of California...

2114
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:31,078
if he's to reenter
the atmosphere

2115
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:32,389
at the designated point...

2116
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:34,437
and land in the recovery area

2117
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:37,393
700 miles south
and east of Florida.

2118
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:40,199
Stay tuned to this station
for further details.

2119
01:53:40,360 --> 01:53:42,510
You're going to be
using fly-by-wire

2120
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:43,600
for re-entry.

2121
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:46,433
You'll need to maintain
a zero angle, over.

2122
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:48,716
Roger. I'm on fly-by-wire.

2123
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:50,911
Back it up with manual. Over.

2124
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:52,229
Keep talking to him.

2125
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:53,400
Roger.

2126
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:55,915
The weather,
the recovery area...

2127
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:58,389
three foot waves,
10 miles visibility.

2128
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:00,915
CAPCOM, you're going out.

2129
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:02,911
He's crossing the
communication blackout zone.

2130
01:54:06,040 --> 01:54:07,439
There's a real fireball outside.

2131
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:08,880
It's getting
a little hot in here.

2132
01:54:22,240 --> 01:54:23,559
CAPCOM, do you copy?

2133
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:55,108
Friendship 7,
do you copy? Over.

2134
01:54:59,320 --> 01:55:00,320
Again.

2135
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:02,471
Friendship 7,
do you copy? Over.

2136
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:19,190
Friendship 7,
do you copy? Over.

2137
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:34,750
Loud and clear, CAPCOM.

2138
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:37,115
Roger that.
How are you doing?

2139
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:41,399
My condition is good.
That was a real fireball. Boy!

2140
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:42,560
Roger that.

2141
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:44,033
Let's get you
all the way home.

2142
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:45,360
Roger that.

2143
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:47,630
Here's hoping these landing
coordinates still hold.

2144
01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:52,191
Approaching 16.11984.

2145
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:53,280
Roger.

2146
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:57,353
Approaching
minus 165.2356...

2147
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:00,478
in three, two, one.

2148
01:56:00,680 --> 01:56:02,159
Engaging chutes.

2149
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:05,199
Beautiful chute!

2150
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:07,314
How are we looking, CAPCOM?

2151
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:09,351
Your "'Go/No-go" is good.

2152
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:11,676
Landing coordinates
are spot on, 7.

2153
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:13,440
Roger that, CAPCOM.

2154
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:18,033
I've always wanted to swim
in the Bahamas. Over.

2155
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:25,070
John Glenn has splashed down
and he is being recovered.

2156
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:26,275
Thank you!

2157
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:30,674
John Glenn has
splashed down safely...

2158
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:33,274
and is being recovered
by the USS Noa.

2159
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:38,076
Good job. Great job, guys.

2160
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:39,240
Katherine.

2161
01:56:44,360 --> 01:56:45,360
Nice work.

2162
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:48,113
You too, Mr. Harrison.

2163
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:50,595
So, um...

2164
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:53,792
you think
we can get to the moon?

2165
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:58,388
We're already there, sir.

2166
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:02,920
Yeah.

2167
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:13,079
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

2168
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:43,838
Girls, this is
Mrs. Vaughan...

2169
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,353
your supervisor.

2170
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:46,953
She'll show you
how things work.

2171
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:48,835
Come on in.

2172
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:55,193
The IBM 7090 data
processing system...

2173
01:57:55,320 --> 01:58:00,155
is capable of solving 24,000
multiplications per second.

2174
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:49,556
They'll call it a mystery

2175
01:59:50,120 --> 01:59:52,588
But we're gonna call it
Victory

2176
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:54,233
We'll be writing history

2177
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:55,919
It's gonna be

2178
01:59:56,280 --> 01:59:57,599
Victory

2179
01:59:57,720 --> 01:59:59,631
They'll be signs
on top of signs

2180
01:59:59,720 --> 02:00:00,994
Just so you know the

2181
02:00:01,080 --> 02:00:02,513
History

2182
02:00:02,600 --> 02:00:04,477
It's saying victory

2183
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:07,597
Is with me

2184
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:10,635
Oh, let them laugh about it

2185
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:13,155
Don't worry
what the doubter's saying

2186
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:15,316
Yes, it's an uphill battle

2187
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:17,749
But guess who else
is playin '

2188
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:20,628
The next time
y'all in action

2189
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:22,791
And the ghost is in the room

2190
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:25,749
Watch you work
through the masses

2191
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:27,637
You know
that we've been used

2192
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:29,956
Don't let it be

2193
02:00:30,280 --> 02:00:31,952
Don't let it be

2194
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:36,997
No matter how deep

2195
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:42,634
I swear just believe

2196
02:00:42,760 --> 02:00:44,671
You'll find victory

2197
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:47,314
Find your victory

2198
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:49,870
They'll call it a mystery

2199
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:51,833
But we're gonna call it

2200
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:52,960
Victory

2201
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:54,951
We'll be writing history

2202
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:56,678
It's gonna be

2203
02:00:56,840 --> 02:00:58,068
Victory

2204
02:00:58,160 --> 02:01:00,116
They'll be
signs on top of signs

2205
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:01,872
Just so you know the

2206
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,149
History

2207
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:04,998
It's saying victory

2208
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,718
Is with me

2209
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:11,954
The Bible says
you should pray for nothing

2210
02:01:12,040 --> 02:01:13,917
'Cause every week
it's gonna be something

2211
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,958
You know the devil
can't wait to jump in

2212
02:01:17,080 --> 02:01:19,036
And complicate
the things you trust in

2213
02:01:19,160 --> 02:01:21,469
But I know my foundation

2214
02:01:21,560 --> 02:01:24,154
Is solid
and can take some hating

2215
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:27,030
Prayer's gon' be
on this space station

2216
02:01:27,200 --> 02:01:29,236
On the way
to the master's apron

2217
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:31,993
They'll call it a mystery

2218
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:33,433
Victory

2219
02:01:33,520 --> 02:01:35,670
We'll be writing history

2220
02:01:35,760 --> 02:01:36,795
It's gon' be

2221
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:38,518
Victory

2222
02:01:38,600 --> 02:01:41,034
It's saying victory

2223
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:43,719
Is with me

2224
02:01:45,720 --> 02:01:47,039
Hey!

2225
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:49,197
Oh

2226
02:01:58,840 --> 02:02:01,149
When I first got here

2227
02:02:01,240 --> 02:02:03,231
I defined my way

2228
02:02:03,400 --> 02:02:05,868
But the end of the days
were dark

2229
02:02:06,040 --> 02:02:08,554
When I was not clear

2230
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:10,233
You showed me my mistakes

2231
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:13,398
But told me keep the pace
Don't get lost

2232
02:02:13,560 --> 02:02:18,111
So should I not fear, yeah

2233
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:21,031
That's how it feels
when you love me

2234
02:02:21,120 --> 02:02:23,634
And you're my sightseer

2235
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:25,751
'Cause before I'm in a rut

2236
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:28,838
You multiply by 10 times
what they took from me

2237
02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:33,429
You send out a branch
from the longest tree

2238
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:36,597
When I'm in quicksand

2239
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:41,274
But in my mind
it's really your arm to me

2240
02:02:41,480 --> 02:02:45,473
Can't believe it, what a
lift and hard to believe

2241
02:02:45,600 --> 02:02:47,989
Surrender
But there's a difference

2242
02:02:48,120 --> 02:02:50,315
Surrender, surrender

2243
02:02:50,440 --> 02:02:53,113
'Cause I understand
Explain to me

2244
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:55,510
There's no coincidence

2245
02:02:55,600 --> 02:02:57,636
Just confirmation

2246
02:02:57,960 --> 02:02:59,279
Let me see them hands

2247
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:01,872
I was down on myself

2248
02:03:01,960 --> 02:03:03,552
And I called you

2249
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:08,634
And your answer is
"What can I do?"

2250
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:12,950
So much you do for me

2251
02:03:15,080 --> 02:03:18,629
In the sound of my breath
seen all the years

2252
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:20,756
Of surrender

2253
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:24,311
Just know I'm here

2254
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,639
Reporting for duty

2255
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:32,272
When it feel this good
Don't ever let go, go

2256
02:03:32,360 --> 02:03:35,511
Don't ever let go, oh

2257
02:03:36,840 --> 02:03:39,513
When it feel this good
Don't ever let go, go

2258
02:03:39,680 --> 02:03:41,193
Don't ever let go, oh

2259
02:03:41,480 --> 02:03:43,152
Don't ever let go, oh

2260
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:45,989
Hard to believe

2261
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:48,157
Surrender
but there's a difference

2262
02:03:48,280 --> 02:03:50,191
Surrender, surrender

2263
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:53,554
'Cause I understand
Explain to me

2264
02:03:54,160 --> 02:03:56,071
There's no coincidence

2265
02:03:56,160 --> 02:03:57,878
Just confirmation

2266
02:03:58,680 --> 02:04:00,272
Let me see them hands

2267
02:04:00,360 --> 02:04:01,588
Please, just wave

2268
02:04:01,680 --> 02:04:03,113
Wave, wave

2269
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:05,998
Wave, wave Wave

2270
02:04:06,240 --> 02:04:07,309
In this place

2271
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:09,553
Just wave
Wave

2272
02:04:09,680 --> 02:04:10,874
Wave your hands

2273
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:13,232
Wave, wave

2274
02:04:18,720 --> 02:04:22,315
Try to understand the way
I've been behaving

2275
02:04:22,680 --> 02:04:25,877
It's a funny thing
you really gotta see

2276
02:04:26,680 --> 02:04:29,717
Is it just your love
that's got me going crazy?

2277
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:32,395
Or are my eyes
playing with me

2278
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:38,397
All day your love just
comes shining down

2279
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:42,158
Just like the sweetest bees

2280
02:04:43,240 --> 02:04:46,550
I feel you from
my root to my crown

2281
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:51,239
It's mighty good to me
Like caramel

2282
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:53,157
He's right beside me

2283
02:04:53,240 --> 02:04:55,231
My mind's his carousel

2284
02:04:55,320 --> 02:04:57,231
It's how he rides me

2285
02:04:57,360 --> 02:04:59,396
So there's no parallels

2286
02:04:59,480 --> 02:05:03,075
Y'all know me very well

2287
02:05:03,400 --> 02:05:05,038
It's yellow lightning

2288
02:05:06,920 --> 02:05:09,753
Try to understand the way
I've been behaving

2289
02:05:10,760 --> 02:05:13,718
It's a funny thing
you really gotta see

2290
02:05:14,720 --> 02:05:17,757
Is it just your love
that's got me going crazy

2291
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:20,235
Or are my eyes
playing with me

2292
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:22,596
Just like a mirage

2293
02:05:24,360 --> 02:05:28,114
I love you like
you were gold

2294
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:30,869
Just like a mirage

2295
02:05:32,440 --> 02:05:35,750
I love you
like you were gold

2296
02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:38,596
Just like a mirage

2297
02:05:40,280 --> 02:05:42,714
I love you
like you were gold

2298
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:44,552
Gold, gold

2299
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:47,475
And I'm sorry, baby

2300
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:49,631
For the what ifs, maybes

2301
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:51,557
I've taken too far

2302
02:05:51,640 --> 02:05:53,710
I know I must be
looking crazy

2303
02:05:53,800 --> 02:05:55,711
I'm sorry, baby

2304
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:57,797
For the what ifs, maybes

2305
02:05:57,920 --> 02:05:59,478
I take it too far

2306
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:02,513
You know I must be
looking crazy

2307
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:05,758
Try to understand the way
I've been behaving

2308
02:06:06,760 --> 02:06:09,558
It's a funny thing
you really gotta see

2309
02:06:10,920 --> 02:06:13,753
Is it just your love that's
got me going crazy

2310
02:06:14,120 --> 02:06:16,270
Or are my eyes
playing with me

2311
02:06:18,720 --> 02:06:21,792
I spent many nights
on my knees praying

2312
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:25,758
From the side effects
of all this heat

2313
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:29,837
But I'm telling y'all
it does feel amazing

2314
02:06:30,120 --> 02:06:32,793
Or are my eyes
playing with me
