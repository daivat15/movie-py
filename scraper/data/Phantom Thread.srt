1
00:00:47,745 --> 00:00:49,895
Reynolds has made
my dreams come true.

2
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:55,299
And I have given him what
he desires most in return.

3
00:00:57,465 --> 00:00:58,500
And what's that?

4
00:01:02,905 --> 00:01:04,259
Every piece of me.

5
00:01:07,945 --> 00:01:10,061
He's a very
demanding man, isn't he?

6
00:01:13,705 --> 00:01:15,662
Must be quite a challenge
to be with him.

7
00:01:16,505 --> 00:01:17,495
Yes.

8
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,022
Maybe he's the most
demanding man.

9
00:02:54,985 --> 00:02:56,100
Morning, ladies.

10
00:03:00,665 --> 00:03:02,178
- Morning.
- Morning, madam.

11
00:03:03,145 --> 00:03:04,180
Good morning, ladies.

12
00:03:26,265 --> 00:03:28,176
- Morning, Biddy.
- Morning, Mr. Woodcock.

13
00:03:29,025 --> 00:03:30,857
- Morning, Nana.
- Morning, Mr. Woodcock.

14
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:32,060
- Pippa.
- Morning, sir.

15
00:04:16,265 --> 00:04:17,414
Try these.

16
00:04:20,585 --> 00:04:23,259
Reynolds. They're delicious.

17
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:26,938
Remember I told you, Johannaâ€œ.

18
00:04:27,945 --> 00:04:29,379
No more stodgy things?

19
00:04:32,145 --> 00:04:33,215
I didn't know that.

20
00:04:36,785 --> 00:04:38,583
You may have told it
to someone else.

21
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:51,985
- Morning.
- Morning, my old so-and-so.

22
00:05:11,385 --> 00:05:12,864
Where have you gone, Reynolds?

23
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:21,062
There's nothing I can say to get
your attention aimed back at me.

24
00:05:22,185 --> 00:05:23,334
Is there?

25
00:05:26,345 --> 00:05:30,020
I cannot begin my day
with a confrontation, please.

26
00:05:31,545 --> 00:05:33,297
I'm delivering the dress today.

27
00:05:34,345 --> 00:05:37,303
And I can't take up space
with a confrontation.

28
00:05:37,425 --> 00:05:39,780
I simply don't have
time for confrontations.

29
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:19,738
Good morning, Countess.
Good morning, Cyril.

30
00:06:20,745 --> 00:06:21,894
Good morning, Peter.

31
00:06:35,305 --> 00:06:37,296
Who is this beautiful stranger?

32
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,654
I need to see you
far more often, Henrietta.

33
00:06:43,585 --> 00:06:47,374
- I am very excited.
- I am, too. Come in.

34
00:07:23,865 --> 00:07:25,014
Exquisite.

35
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:55,660
Yes?

36
00:07:55,985 --> 00:07:57,259
Let's take it for a walk.

37
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,740
Beautiful work, ladies.

38
00:08:13,865 --> 00:08:15,424
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

39
00:08:16,185 --> 00:08:17,539
It's beautiful, Reynolds.

40
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,377
Worth everything
we've been through.

41
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:27,656
I feel like it will
give me courage.

42
00:08:45,665 --> 00:08:47,736
Ladies and gentlemen,
take your seats, please.

43
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,015
- Evening, Stephen. Is she here?
- Yes, sir.

44
00:09:22,385 --> 00:09:24,183
What do you want
to do about Johanna?

45
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:30,499
I mean, she's lovely,
but the time has come.

46
00:09:33,185 --> 00:09:34,380
And she's getting fat,

47
00:09:34,465 --> 00:09:37,423
sitting around waiting for you
to fall in love with her again.

48
00:09:40,945 --> 00:09:42,504
I'll give her the October dress.

49
00:09:44,825 --> 00:09:45,860
If that's all right.

50
00:09:53,505 --> 00:09:55,382
I have an unsettled feeling,

51
00:09:56,505 --> 00:09:57,620
based on

52
00:09:58,545 --> 00:10:00,536
nothing I can put my finger on.

53
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:02,705
Just butterflies.

54
00:10:03,905 --> 00:10:07,057
Been having the strongest
memories of Mama lately,

55
00:10:08,305 --> 00:10:09,898
coming to me in my dreams,

56
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:13,105
smelling her scent.

57
00:10:15,945 --> 00:10:17,583
The strongest sense that

58
00:10:18,745 --> 00:10:19,815
she's near us.

59
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:23,424
Reaching out towards us.

60
00:10:27,505 --> 00:10:30,657
I very much hope that she saw
the dress tonight. Don't you?

61
00:10:32,985 --> 00:10:34,055
Yes.

62
00:10:36,105 --> 00:10:39,621
It's comforting to think the dead
are watching over the living.

63
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,063
I don't find that spooky at all.

64
00:10:49,865 --> 00:10:51,776
Why don't you go
to the country tonight?

65
00:10:53,825 --> 00:10:55,020
I'll follow tomorrow.

66
00:10:56,425 --> 00:10:57,460
Good idea.

67
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:01,618
I like that idea very much.

68
00:11:02,825 --> 00:11:04,224
My old so-and-so.

69
00:11:56,665 --> 00:11:57,700
Mr. Hansford?

70
00:11:59,305 --> 00:12:00,579
- Mr. Hansford?
- Hello?

71
00:12:00,745 --> 00:12:02,179
- Good morning.
- Morning.

72
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:04,698
- Fill it up, please.
- I will do.

73
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:07,055
Check the oil and the tires.
Lovely. Thank you.

74
00:12:09,985 --> 00:12:11,419
It's a hard frost this morning.

75
00:12:11,505 --> 00:12:13,416
It's cold, isn't it?
It's very bitter.

76
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:49,255
Ugh.

77
00:12:54,265 --> 00:12:56,176
Excuse me. Could we have
a bit more toast, please?

78
00:12:56,265 --> 00:12:57,255
Yes.

79
00:13:31,585 --> 00:13:33,178
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

80
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:40,103
- Good morning.
- Morning.

81
00:13:41,585 --> 00:13:43,019
What would you like to order?

82
00:13:47,545 --> 00:13:48,819
A Welsh rarebit...

83
00:13:52,825 --> 00:13:54,782
With a poached egg
on top, please.

84
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:56,580
Not too runny.

85
00:13:57,465 --> 00:13:58,455
And bacon,

86
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:00,740
scones,

87
00:14:02,065 --> 00:14:03,738
butter, cream,

88
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:06,615
jam,

89
00:14:08,385 --> 00:14:09,420
not strawberry.

90
00:14:12,105 --> 00:14:13,095
No.

91
00:14:14,385 --> 00:14:15,420
Raspberry?

92
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,095
What else?

93
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:22,095
Coffee or tea?

94
00:14:22,265 --> 00:14:23,380
Do you have Lapsang?

95
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:26,577
I'll have a pot
of Lapsang, please.

96
00:14:26,705 --> 00:14:27,934
Good choice.

97
00:14:28,185 --> 00:14:29,334
And some sausages.

98
00:14:31,065 --> 00:14:32,385
And some sausages.

99
00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:39,780
Show me.

100
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:50,254
Will you remember?

101
00:14:51,305 --> 00:14:52,375
Yes.

102
00:14:54,345 --> 00:14:55,415
I'm keeping this.

103
00:15:22,065 --> 00:15:23,055
And now?

104
00:15:25,505 --> 00:15:26,939
Will you have dinner with me?

105
00:15:30,385 --> 00:15:31,375
Yes.

106
00:15:46,265 --> 00:15:47,699
For the hungry boy,

107
00:15:48,185 --> 00:15:49,414
my name is Alma.

108
00:16:13,985 --> 00:16:15,419
- Am I late?
- No.

109
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:44,900
What do you think?

110
00:16:46,665 --> 00:16:47,780
Hmm.

111
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:49,814
I like the sauce.

112
00:16:51,265 --> 00:16:52,300
Custard.

113
00:16:57,825 --> 00:16:58,815
It's quite good.

114
00:16:58,905 --> 00:16:59,895
Mmm-hmm.

115
00:17:06,305 --> 00:17:07,659
May I, Alma?

116
00:17:10,345 --> 00:17:11,938
I like to see
who I'm talking to.

117
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:19,459
Here.

118
00:17:24,185 --> 00:17:25,220
Mmm.

119
00:17:31,745 --> 00:17:33,543
There you are. That's better.

120
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:37,664
Does your mother
have brown eyes?

121
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:40,575
Green.

122
00:17:41,105 --> 00:17:42,584
Do you look very much like her?

123
00:17:44,345 --> 00:17:45,540
I don't know, I think so.

124
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:48,260
Do you have a photograph?

125
00:17:49,545 --> 00:17:50,535
Yes.

126
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:54,056
- Would you let me see it?
- Not here, at home.

127
00:17:57,185 --> 00:17:58,414
Carry it with you.

128
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,218
Always carry her with you.

129
00:18:07,185 --> 00:18:08,255
Where's yours?

130
00:18:09,185 --> 00:18:10,220
Your mother.

131
00:18:10,785 --> 00:18:12,219
She's here in the canvas.

132
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:20,097
- What do you mean?
- Hmm.

133
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,458
You can sew almost anything
into the canvas of a coat.

134
00:18:27,905 --> 00:18:28,975
Secrets,

135
00:18:30,545 --> 00:18:31,580
coins,

136
00:18:32,185 --> 00:18:33,619
words, little messages.

137
00:18:35,745 --> 00:18:38,703
When I was a boy,
I started to hide things

138
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,378
in the linings of the garments,

139
00:18:41,545 --> 00:18:43,263
things that only I knew
were there.

140
00:18:45,385 --> 00:18:48,138
And over my breast, I have a
lock of my mother's hair,

141
00:18:49,385 --> 00:18:51,137
to keep her close to me always.

142
00:18:53,865 --> 00:18:55,458
She was quite
a remarkable woman.

143
00:18:55,545 --> 00:18:56,774
She taught me my trade.

144
00:18:57,545 --> 00:19:00,185
So I try to never be
without her.

145
00:19:06,425 --> 00:19:08,063
You must love her very much.

146
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,575
Hello.

147
00:19:34,705 --> 00:19:36,582
This is Alma. Say hello to Alma.

148
00:19:37,105 --> 00:19:38,095
Hello.

149
00:19:38,185 --> 00:19:39,619
This is Alma.
Come say hello to Alma.

150
00:19:39,705 --> 00:19:41,298
- Come on, come on.
- Hello.

151
00:19:41,425 --> 00:19:43,177
Shall we show her
the house, lads?

152
00:20:02,385 --> 00:20:05,264
I made this dress for
her when I was 16 years old.

153
00:20:05,345 --> 00:20:06,335
It's beautiful.

154
00:20:06,825 --> 00:20:09,294
'Twas for her second
husband, for the wedding.

155
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:12,221
My father had died
many years before.

156
00:20:13,265 --> 00:20:15,939
Our nanny,
the evil Miss Blackwood...

157
00:20:16,985 --> 00:20:18,862
Black Death, we used to call her.

158
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,457
Because of superstition, she
refused to help me sew the dress,

159
00:20:23,065 --> 00:20:25,579
as she believed it would
bring her bad fortune,

160
00:20:25,865 --> 00:20:27,185
to never be a bride.

161
00:20:27,985 --> 00:20:29,658
Not that anyone
would have had her.

162
00:20:30,265 --> 00:20:33,417
And she seemed ancient to us, I have
no idea how old she actually was,

163
00:20:33,505 --> 00:20:35,462
and monstrously ugly.

164
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,020
So...

165
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:39,942
I worked alone
for months and months,

166
00:20:40,025 --> 00:20:41,015
hunched over,

167
00:20:41,545 --> 00:20:43,934
sewing and sweating and sewing.

168
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:47,822
And the Black Death
never married anyway.

169
00:20:47,905 --> 00:20:49,782
All the help I could
have had from her.

170
00:20:50,545 --> 00:20:53,822
'Twas my sister, Cyril, came
to my rescue in the end.

171
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:59,698
There are endless superstitions
when making a wedding dress.

172
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:03,184
Young girls afraid they'll
never marry if they touch one.

173
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:07,220
Or models afraid
they'll marry only bald men

174
00:21:07,305 --> 00:21:08,784
if they put one on.

175
00:21:12,865 --> 00:21:14,742
And where's the dress now?

176
00:21:18,905 --> 00:21:20,862
I have no idea
what happened to it.

177
00:21:21,425 --> 00:21:22,460
No idea.

178
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:24,862
Most probably
turned to ashes by now.

179
00:21:25,705 --> 00:21:26,820
Fallen to pieces.

180
00:21:29,745 --> 00:21:31,816
And your sister?

181
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:33,495
What?

182
00:21:35,105 --> 00:21:36,459
Did she ever marry?

183
00:21:38,105 --> 00:21:39,140
No.

184
00:21:40,585 --> 00:21:42,098
C'mon, boys, let's have a fire.

185
00:22:01,985 --> 00:22:04,898
If you want to have a staring
contest with me, you will lose.

186
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:09,820
Hmm.

187
00:22:15,345 --> 00:22:16,380
Hmm.

188
00:22:24,305 --> 00:22:25,784
You're a very handsome man.

189
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,541
You must be around
many beautiful women.

190
00:22:37,185 --> 00:22:38,175
Yes.

191
00:22:42,305 --> 00:22:43,784
So, why are you not married?

192
00:22:44,745 --> 00:22:45,780
I make dresses.

193
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,385
You cannot be
married when you make dresses?

194
00:22:50,865 --> 00:22:53,095
I'm certain I was
never meant to marry.

195
00:22:53,585 --> 00:22:55,417
I'm a confirmed bachelor.

196
00:22:58,705 --> 00:22:59,900
I'm incurable.

197
00:23:01,385 --> 00:23:02,614
Hmm.

198
00:23:05,665 --> 00:23:08,544
Marriage would make me deceitful
and I don't ever want that.

199
00:23:12,905 --> 00:23:14,623
You sound so sure about things.

200
00:23:15,385 --> 00:23:16,784
I'm sure about that.

201
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,255
I think you're
only acting strong.

202
00:23:25,865 --> 00:23:27,094
No, lam strong.

203
00:23:30,865 --> 00:23:33,334
For who? Not for me, I hope.

204
00:23:36,785 --> 00:23:40,221
I think it's the expectations
and assumptions of others

205
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:42,739
that cause heartache.

206
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:54,584
Would you help me
with something?

207
00:23:56,905 --> 00:23:58,054
- Yes.
- Come on.

208
00:24:12,905 --> 00:24:15,181
Good. Just jump up
on the box for me.

209
00:25:19,105 --> 00:25:20,698
I think we're going to try and

210
00:25:22,025 --> 00:25:23,345
pull this back for you.

211
00:25:49,545 --> 00:25:50,615
Pretty good.

212
00:25:51,545 --> 00:25:52,580
One moment.

213
00:25:57,905 --> 00:26:00,658
We'll save that one
for another time.

214
00:26:08,385 --> 00:26:09,420
Quite nice.

215
00:26:10,865 --> 00:26:11,855
But, um...

216
00:26:14,345 --> 00:26:15,460
Mmm.

217
00:26:18,105 --> 00:26:19,175
Bit serious.

218
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:36,695
This one.

219
00:26:39,145 --> 00:26:40,215
Do you like it?

220
00:26:42,465 --> 00:26:44,138
- Yes.
- It's very good.

221
00:26:55,265 --> 00:26:56,255
That's it.

222
00:26:57,065 --> 00:26:58,703
Let's get that off you, and then

223
00:26:58,945 --> 00:27:01,539
I'd like to take your measurements.
Is that all right?

224
00:27:17,745 --> 00:27:20,976
And who's this lovely creature
making the house smell so nice?

225
00:27:22,385 --> 00:27:23,659
Hello, I'm Alma.

226
00:27:24,825 --> 00:27:25,895
I'm Cyril.

227
00:27:30,985 --> 00:27:32,384
Sandalwood and rose water.

228
00:27:39,745 --> 00:27:41,338
Mmm. Sherry,

229
00:27:41,905 --> 00:27:42,975
and...

230
00:27:43,305 --> 00:27:45,057
Lemon juice?

231
00:27:46,345 --> 00:27:48,859
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.
We had fish for dinner.

232
00:27:49,665 --> 00:27:52,054
My old so-and-so.
Would you mind?

233
00:28:34,105 --> 00:28:35,857
Can you step
towards me? Ready?

234
00:28:41,425 --> 00:28:42,415
Thirty-two.

235
00:28:45,385 --> 00:28:46,375
Thirty.

236
00:28:48,465 --> 00:28:49,455
Thirty-one.

237
00:28:54,985 --> 00:28:56,578
Thirty-five and a half.

238
00:29:02,385 --> 00:29:03,659
Fourteen and a half...

239
00:29:04,585 --> 00:29:05,655
Seventeen...

240
00:29:06,065 --> 00:29:07,055
Twenty.

241
00:29:08,945 --> 00:29:11,334
- Can you just stand normally?
- Yes.

242
00:29:14,305 --> 00:29:16,216
- I stand normally.
- Like before.

243
00:29:17,945 --> 00:29:19,174
- What do you mean?
- Straight.

244
00:29:19,305 --> 00:29:20,295
- Straight.
- Like that.

245
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:21,614
Yeah, you didn't say that.

246
00:29:31,345 --> 00:29:32,665
Sixteen and a half.

247
00:29:36,825 --> 00:29:37,895
Eight and a half.

248
00:29:38,585 --> 00:29:39,734
You have no breasts.

249
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:41,180
Twenty-two.

250
00:29:42,905 --> 00:29:44,623
- Yes, I know.
- Thirty-two and a half.

251
00:29:44,705 --> 00:29:45,934
You can drop your arm now.

252
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:49,264
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, you're perfect.

253
00:29:50,545 --> 00:29:51,899
My job to give you some,

254
00:29:54,905 --> 00:29:56,100
if I choose to.

255
00:29:59,185 --> 00:30:00,220
Ten.

256
00:30:01,865 --> 00:30:02,855
Nine.

257
00:30:04,185 --> 00:30:05,300
Six and a half.

258
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,860
Twenty-five.

259
00:30:10,905 --> 00:30:13,545
And 45. That's it.

260
00:30:22,265 --> 00:30:24,825
- Would you try something else for me?
- Yes.

261
00:30:36,225 --> 00:30:37,784
You have the ideal shape.

262
00:30:39,825 --> 00:30:41,384
- I do?
- Mmm-hmm.

263
00:30:43,065 --> 00:30:44,214
He likes a little belly.

264
00:31:06,745 --> 00:31:08,622
I never really liked myself.

265
00:31:11,225 --> 00:31:12,374
I thought my

266
00:31:13,985 --> 00:31:15,737
shoulders were too wide,

267
00:31:16,665 --> 00:31:19,578
my neck was skinny like a bird,

268
00:31:21,465 --> 00:31:22,864
that I had no breasts.

269
00:31:26,145 --> 00:31:29,137
I felt my hips were larger
than needed,

270
00:31:29,585 --> 00:31:31,098
and my arms too strong.

271
00:31:37,345 --> 00:31:40,303
I feel as if I've been looking
for you for a very long time.

272
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:47,695
You found me.

273
00:31:53,665 --> 00:31:54,860
Whatever you do,

274
00:31:56,385 --> 00:31:57,375
do it carefully.

275
00:32:11,025 --> 00:32:13,016
But in his work,
I become perfect.

276
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:16,340
And I feel just right.

277
00:32:26,505 --> 00:32:28,018
Good evening,
Mr. Woodcock, sir.

278
00:32:28,105 --> 00:32:30,779
Maybe that's how
all women feel in his clothes.

279
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,938
You look beautiful, really.

280
00:33:06,265 --> 00:33:07,335
Very beautiful.

281
00:33:08,145 --> 00:33:10,898
You're making me
extremely hungry.

282
00:33:13,065 --> 00:33:15,181
- Thank you.
- I ordered you a steak tartare.

283
00:33:15,505 --> 00:33:16,620
Oh, perfect. Thank you.

284
00:33:16,705 --> 00:33:17,820
My little carnivore.

285
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:21,775
I've just been on the telephone
to your favorite client.

286
00:33:22,505 --> 00:33:23,575
Mmm-hmm.

287
00:33:24,305 --> 00:33:26,216
Barbara Rose
is getting married again.

288
00:33:27,345 --> 00:33:28,574
Oh, goody.

289
00:33:29,505 --> 00:33:30,620
All right. Well...

290
00:33:31,465 --> 00:33:33,854
Think I'd better have another one of these.

291
00:33:50,265 --> 00:33:51,380
That's your room.

292
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:54,694
I'm right next door.

293
00:33:58,865 --> 00:33:59,935
Get your rest.

294
00:34:00,065 --> 00:34:01,897
We'll start early
in the morning.

295
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:04,660
How early?

296
00:34:07,465 --> 00:34:08,500
I'll wake you.

297
00:34:10,505 --> 00:34:11,540
Good night.

298
00:34:12,665 --> 00:34:13,700
Good night.

299
00:34:31,345 --> 00:34:32,380
Sometimes

300
00:34:33,225 --> 00:34:35,023
we wake up
at 4:00 in the morning,

301
00:34:36,745 --> 00:34:38,736
after we've gone
to bed at midnight.

302
00:34:40,425 --> 00:34:42,063
And then he's ready
to start again.

303
00:34:44,865 --> 00:34:46,503
And I can stand endlessly.

304
00:34:48,785 --> 00:34:50,662
No one can stand
as long as I can.

305
00:34:52,505 --> 00:34:53,654
What is it, Alma?

306
00:34:55,225 --> 00:34:57,535
What are you looking
so forlorn about, hmm?

307
00:34:58,585 --> 00:34:59,655
I don't know, I...

308
00:35:00,305 --> 00:35:02,581
I think I don't like
the fabric so much.

309
00:35:06,745 --> 00:35:09,055
Well, Alma,
this fabric is adored

310
00:35:09,305 --> 00:35:11,216
by the women
who wear our design.

311
00:35:13,145 --> 00:35:14,544
It's perfect for this dress.

312
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:16,774
Cyril is right.

313
00:35:18,705 --> 00:35:20,264
Cyril is always right.

314
00:35:22,905 --> 00:35:26,819
It's not because the fabric is adored
by the clients that Cyril is right.

315
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:28,818
It's right because it's right.

316
00:35:30,585 --> 00:35:31,700
Because it's beautiful.

317
00:35:34,425 --> 00:35:36,575
Maybe one day you'll
change your taste, Alma.

318
00:35:40,385 --> 00:35:41,375
Maybe not.

319
00:35:42,345 --> 00:35:43,938
Maybe you have no taste.

320
00:35:46,345 --> 00:35:48,018
Maybe I like my own taste.

321
00:35:49,465 --> 00:35:51,502
Yes, just enough
to get you into trouble.

322
00:35:53,945 --> 00:35:55,982
- Perhaps I'm looking for trouble.
- Stop!

323
00:35:58,305 --> 00:36:01,900
You know, at the big races and
the Derby and, uh, thoseâ€œ.

324
00:36:02,025 --> 00:36:04,301
- Yes?
- Excuse me, Mr. Woodcock.

325
00:36:05,985 --> 00:36:08,943
I would like to say that I hope one
day I could wear one of your dresses.

326
00:36:10,225 --> 00:36:11,260
Oh, thank you.

327
00:36:11,345 --> 00:36:13,302
If that's your wish, I hope
it comes true for you.

328
00:36:14,025 --> 00:36:15,015
She really means it.

329
00:36:15,105 --> 00:36:17,984
She told me she wants to be
buried in a dress that you make.

330
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:19,695
Hmm.

331
00:36:20,905 --> 00:36:22,976
- Thank you.
- Thank you, ladies, for your kind words.

332
00:36:23,065 --> 00:36:24,100
Good night.

333
00:36:24,185 --> 00:36:25,255
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

334
00:36:25,385 --> 00:36:27,581
- Good night. Thank you very much.
- Good night.

335
00:36:28,025 --> 00:36:30,665
You'd dig her up and sell the
dress again, wouldn't you, Nigel?

336
00:36:30,745 --> 00:36:33,214
Well, otherwise it would
seem to be going to a waste,

337
00:36:33,305 --> 00:36:35,137
but, yeah, I mean,
one but can try.

338
00:36:35,225 --> 00:36:37,501
Nigel, why aren't
you eating your profiteroles?

339
00:36:37,585 --> 00:36:38,575
What?

340
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:42,585
Have you had enough to eat?

341
00:36:48,785 --> 00:36:49,855
You seem thirsty.

342
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:23,980
Morning, Reynolds.

343
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,338
Mmm-hmm.
- Morning, Cyril.

344
00:38:03,545 --> 00:38:05,980
Please, don't move
so much, Alma.

345
00:38:10,065 --> 00:38:13,501
I'm buttering my toast,
I'm not moving too much.

346
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:14,575
Well, it's too much.

347
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:18,054
It's a distraction,
it's very distracting.

348
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:25,099
Maybe you pay
too much attention to it.

349
00:38:27,545 --> 00:38:28,944
It's hard to ignore.

350
00:38:29,945 --> 00:38:32,221
It's as if you just rode
a horse across the room.

351
00:38:38,185 --> 00:38:39,539
This is too much movement.

352
00:38:40,825 --> 00:38:43,863
It is entirely too much
movement at breakfast.

353
00:38:59,585 --> 00:39:01,895
Perhaps you should
take your breakfast after him.

354
00:39:04,745 --> 00:39:06,099
Or in your room.

355
00:39:08,625 --> 00:39:10,184
I think he's being too fussy.

356
00:39:10,825 --> 00:39:14,455
His routine, when he's in
it, is best not shaken.

357
00:39:14,545 --> 00:39:16,377
- Well...
- This is a quiet time,

358
00:39:17,985 --> 00:39:19,419
not to be misused.

359
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:22,899
If breakfast isn't right,

360
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,898
it's very hard for him to recover
for the rest of the day.

361
00:39:27,305 --> 00:39:28,534
I didn't know that.

362
00:39:28,985 --> 00:39:30,259
No, of course you didn't.

363
00:39:32,465 --> 00:39:33,580
But you do now.

364
00:39:38,425 --> 00:39:40,018
Still I think he's too fussy.

365
00:39:44,105 --> 00:39:45,334
Well, that's as may be.

366
00:39:55,425 --> 00:40:00,374
This is Flemish bobbin
lace from the late 1600s.

367
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:02,695
It's very rare, very precious.

368
00:40:03,545 --> 00:40:06,503
I rescued it from Antwerp
during the war.

369
00:40:06,785 --> 00:40:08,935
I've been waiting
for the right moment to...

370
00:40:09,905 --> 00:40:11,418
To make something with it.

371
00:40:18,665 --> 00:40:19,780
Hold it.

372
00:40:19,865 --> 00:40:22,175
- That's very nice. That's beautiful.
- That's good.

373
00:40:22,305 --> 00:40:25,263
- Best yet. Beautiful.
- Very nice. Turn towards the light.

374
00:40:25,345 --> 00:40:27,495
Um, just look towards
the window, please, Alma.

375
00:40:28,945 --> 00:40:31,380
Amber, could you just
lift the bodice,

376
00:40:32,345 --> 00:40:33,494
a little bit?

377
00:40:33,585 --> 00:40:34,905
It keeps dropping down.

378
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:38,258
We need to get that adjusted properly.
It's ridiculous.

379
00:40:39,505 --> 00:40:41,781
- Just get it fixed.
- Yes, sir.

380
00:40:41,865 --> 00:40:43,697
Should've been
ready today, quite honestly.

381
00:40:43,785 --> 00:40:45,014
Keep your eye on that.

382
00:40:45,105 --> 00:40:46,823
- Together.
- I'm not sitting on the floor.

383
00:40:46,905 --> 00:40:48,054
Sit on the floor.

384
00:40:48,545 --> 00:40:49,660
You're lovely.

385
00:40:50,785 --> 00:40:53,425
Ah, it's great.
That's great.

386
00:40:53,505 --> 00:40:55,655
Okay, hold that
while I change the film.

387
00:40:55,985 --> 00:40:57,134
Have I finished yet?

388
00:40:58,385 --> 00:40:59,375
All right, that's it.

389
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,258
I need to do some work.

390
00:41:01,545 --> 00:41:02,865
Hell.

391
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:23,660
Yes?

392
00:41:25,585 --> 00:41:26,655
May I come in?

393
00:41:29,185 --> 00:41:30,175
I'm working.

394
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,104
Do you need anything?

395
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:56,385
It's fabulous on the shoulders.

396
00:41:56,905 --> 00:42:00,580
Shoulder drapes, and then you
can put it on completely.

397
00:42:01,905 --> 00:42:03,179
Okay?

398
00:42:03,705 --> 00:42:04,854
Good, good, good.

399
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:06,864
Alma? Is she ready?

400
00:42:07,345 --> 00:42:08,335
Nearly.

401
00:42:10,305 --> 00:42:11,898
Come on, please.

402
00:42:19,185 --> 00:42:20,584
Mmm-hmm.

403
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:37,579
Ingrid.

404
00:42:39,105 --> 00:42:40,425
Uh, cape's wrong.
Let me do it.

405
00:42:40,945 --> 00:42:42,015
Let me do it.

406
00:43:14,865 --> 00:43:17,334
Ellie, you ready?
Let's have a look at you.

407
00:43:17,505 --> 00:43:18,859
Stand here, please.

408
00:43:37,025 --> 00:43:38,060
Mmm.

409
00:43:39,385 --> 00:43:40,659
All right.

410
00:43:42,585 --> 00:43:44,815
Off you go. Thank you, Pippa.
Ingrid, you ready?

411
00:44:00,865 --> 00:44:03,584
Let me do it, let me do it.
Damn it.

412
00:44:08,265 --> 00:44:10,495
You're no good to me
just standing there, Pippa!

413
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:13,060
- I need your hands on this.
- Sorry, sir. Sorry. Yes.

414
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:16,262
Just go. Go, go!

415
00:44:17,025 --> 00:44:18,459
I'm sorry.

416
00:44:56,425 --> 00:44:57,904
Let me drive for you.

417
00:45:25,905 --> 00:45:27,259
You see, when you...

418
00:45:27,745 --> 00:45:29,099
When you love your work

419
00:45:29,865 --> 00:45:32,698
and you can give like he does...

420
00:45:34,185 --> 00:45:36,825
You need to come down

421
00:45:38,025 --> 00:45:39,060
again.

422
00:45:41,545 --> 00:45:42,740
And then he's...

423
00:45:43,705 --> 00:45:44,934
He's a baby.

424
00:45:45,505 --> 00:45:47,337
Like a spoiled little baby.

425
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:54,334
When he's like this,
he's very tender.

426
00:45:55,145 --> 00:45:56,374
Open.

427
00:46:05,185 --> 00:46:06,937
How long will these
episodes last?

428
00:46:08,945 --> 00:46:12,063
Only a few days,
and then he's well again.

429
00:46:31,785 --> 00:46:34,743
- No. Alma, what are you doing?
- There's tea for you.

430
00:46:34,865 --> 00:46:37,698
Don't put the tray on the table, please.
Just take it off.

431
00:46:38,105 --> 00:46:39,664
I didn't ask for tea.

432
00:46:40,225 --> 00:46:41,499
No, but...

433
00:46:42,145 --> 00:46:43,544
Can you take it out, please?

434
00:46:43,745 --> 00:46:45,099
Yes, I can take it out.

435
00:46:46,065 --> 00:46:48,944
- It's a bit late now, isn't it?
- I'm taking it out.

436
00:46:49,025 --> 00:46:50,982
Yeah, but it's a bit
late now, isn't it?

437
00:46:51,385 --> 00:46:52,819
But I'm taking it out.

438
00:46:52,905 --> 00:46:56,819
The tea is going out, the interruption
is staying right here with me.

439
00:47:16,025 --> 00:47:20,337
What if they are yellow
underneath and white on top?

440
00:47:22,665 --> 00:47:24,576
The poison ones have gills.

441
00:47:26,025 --> 00:47:27,584
Look at the book in the kitchen.

442
00:47:33,465 --> 00:47:34,944
We cook them in fat?

443
00:47:35,825 --> 00:47:37,498
No, we'll cook them in butter.

444
00:47:38,345 --> 00:47:39,744
But not too much.

445
00:47:40,745 --> 00:47:43,305
Mr. Woodcock detests
too much butter.

446
00:48:35,025 --> 00:48:38,655
There's a very good chance Barbara Rose
will ask you to attend her wedding.

447
00:48:45,585 --> 00:48:47,337
What do you want me
to do with that?

448
00:48:54,505 --> 00:48:56,018
Accept her invitation.

449
00:48:57,745 --> 00:48:59,065
If you can stomach it.

450
00:49:03,465 --> 00:49:06,617
I really wish I hadn't heard
this till later on, Cyril.

451
00:49:07,185 --> 00:49:08,539
It's very unsettling.

452
00:49:11,945 --> 00:49:13,060
Well,

453
00:49:14,145 --> 00:49:15,215
chin up.

454
00:49:21,705 --> 00:49:23,582
Barbara Rose pays
for this house.

455
00:49:37,425 --> 00:49:38,460
All right?

456
00:49:43,985 --> 00:49:45,896
Morning, Barbara.

457
00:49:46,425 --> 00:49:48,701
Morning, Cal.
Morning, Tippy.

458
00:49:48,825 --> 00:49:50,975
- Good morning,
- Mr. Woodcock.

459
00:49:55,745 --> 00:49:57,099
Reynolds.

460
00:49:59,785 --> 00:50:01,298
Let's get started.

461
00:50:19,265 --> 00:50:20,744
Put it in there.

462
00:50:20,945 --> 00:50:22,299
Thank you.

463
00:50:23,225 --> 00:50:25,136
I'm just going
to lift this up, Barbara.

464
00:50:25,225 --> 00:50:26,260
Oh.

465
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:37,502
I know you're doing
the best you can.

466
00:50:40,345 --> 00:50:41,540
Don't do that.

467
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,981
- Take your hand away, please.
- I'm still so ugly.

468
00:50:44,185 --> 00:50:46,495
Barbara, I'm trying to make
you a beautiful dress.

469
00:50:49,545 --> 00:50:51,024
I need your help.

470
00:50:59,345 --> 00:51:00,540
Uh, please.

471
00:51:12,665 --> 00:51:14,224
Reynolds, will you come?

472
00:51:14,585 --> 00:51:16,144
Just stand still, please.

473
00:51:16,945 --> 00:51:18,902
It's really not my place,
Barbara.

474
00:51:19,665 --> 00:51:21,178
This is what I do.

475
00:51:22,425 --> 00:51:24,143
This is my place, here.

476
00:51:25,385 --> 00:51:28,741
I'm afraid I must insist
that you come.

477
00:51:38,585 --> 00:51:40,496
George Riley, News of the World.

478
00:51:40,625 --> 00:51:44,380
- Who'll be the attendant at the wedding?
- My son, Cal.

479
00:51:44,945 --> 00:51:47,061
My Cal, my son.

480
00:51:47,265 --> 00:51:51,543
He's so wonderful, he's so
in favor of this marriage.

481
00:51:51,705 --> 00:51:53,025
John Evans, Daily Mail.

482
00:51:53,105 --> 00:51:54,903
And what of your holdings,
Miss Rose?

483
00:51:55,265 --> 00:51:57,734
Do they become
Dominican property?

484
00:51:57,865 --> 00:52:00,095
- I don't know, I don't think so.
- If I may say,

485
00:52:00,225 --> 00:52:02,421
we are being married
under Dominican law,

486
00:52:02,505 --> 00:52:05,463
but in my country,
her money belongs to her

487
00:52:05,585 --> 00:52:07,303
and my money belongs to me.

488
00:52:07,385 --> 00:52:10,218
Anyway, why would I need her money?
I have enough of my own.

489
00:52:10,545 --> 00:52:12,661
What's Barbara brought into your life?

490
00:52:13,145 --> 00:52:15,705
I brought sincerity
into his life.

491
00:52:16,545 --> 00:52:18,536
- Sincerity?
- Then one kiss for the cameras.

492
00:52:18,625 --> 00:52:20,343
Go on, give us a kiss
for the cameras, Miss Rose.

493
00:52:20,425 --> 00:52:22,018
The answer to the question

494
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,943
- is sincerity.
- Let's give them a kiss...

495
00:52:24,025 --> 00:52:26,778
Rubio, tell us about selling visas
to the Jews during the war.

496
00:52:26,865 --> 00:52:28,264
Thank you.

497
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:29,699
Visas? Jews?

498
00:52:29,825 --> 00:52:32,294
- Thank you very much, gentlemen.
- Thank you for that.

499
00:52:32,825 --> 00:52:34,179
Jews, visas?

500
00:53:34,825 --> 00:53:36,736
That dress doesn't belong here.

501
00:53:38,185 --> 00:53:41,098
- Don't start crying.
- I'm not crying.

502
00:53:42,985 --> 00:53:44,100
I'm angry.

503
00:53:44,225 --> 00:53:46,944
- Well, don't start blubbering, Alma.
- I'm not blubbering.

504
00:53:51,345 --> 00:53:53,177
She doesn't deserve it.

505
00:53:54,385 --> 00:53:56,183
It's your work.

506
00:54:08,265 --> 00:54:09,414
Come on.

507
00:54:13,505 --> 00:54:14,825
Tippy?

508
00:54:16,665 --> 00:54:17,894
Mr. Woodcock.

509
00:54:18,065 --> 00:54:20,022
- What is it?
- I would like the dress back.

510
00:54:20,105 --> 00:54:21,584
Miss Rose is sleeping.

511
00:54:21,745 --> 00:54:23,224
Well, that's got nothing
to do with the dress.

512
00:54:23,305 --> 00:54:24,625
Can you go and get it
for me, please?

513
00:54:24,785 --> 00:54:26,583
She's sleeping.

514
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:29,939
In the dress?

515
00:54:30,945 --> 00:54:32,379
Well, yes.

516
00:54:33,825 --> 00:54:37,819
Go and take the dress off her
and bring it to me right away.

517
00:54:38,905 --> 00:54:41,579
- I don't think so.
- Take the fucking dress off Barbara

518
00:54:41,665 --> 00:54:43,417
and bring it to me
or I'll do it myself!

519
00:54:43,545 --> 00:54:44,944
I beg your pardon?

520
00:54:46,185 --> 00:54:47,539
Alma.

521
00:55:26,225 --> 00:55:28,739
- Hello, Mr. Woodcock.
- Cal.

522
00:55:35,985 --> 00:55:37,305
I...

523
00:55:37,385 --> 00:55:39,137
It's no business of ours

524
00:55:39,465 --> 00:55:41,934
what Mrs. Rose decides
to do with her life.

525
00:55:42,345 --> 00:55:44,416
But she can no longer
behave like this

526
00:55:44,625 --> 00:55:47,014
and be dressed
by the House of Woodcock.

527
00:56:14,545 --> 00:56:15,944
Thank you.

528
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:22,774
I love you.

529
00:56:31,225 --> 00:56:34,183
- Pedigree. That's for mother.
- Racy.

530
00:56:34,985 --> 00:56:36,862
Uh, she'd like
something like that, but...

531
00:56:37,025 --> 00:56:38,663
- Thank you, dear.
- It's Mona's day.

532
00:56:38,785 --> 00:56:40,822
- Yes, it is.
- So I'd like to wear something for her.

533
00:56:40,905 --> 00:56:42,976
- Yes, of course.
- She mentioned that last time.

534
00:56:43,065 --> 00:56:44,294
- Did she?
- Yeah.

535
00:56:44,385 --> 00:56:45,819
- Did she really?
- Yeah.

536
00:56:45,905 --> 00:56:47,100
All right.

537
00:56:47,625 --> 00:56:49,059
- Julie.
- Yes, sir.

538
00:56:49,145 --> 00:56:50,783
- Do we have porridge?
- Yes, we do.

539
00:56:51,505 --> 00:56:53,098
- Um, do we have cream?
- We do, yes.

540
00:56:53,265 --> 00:56:54,664
- Thick cream?
- Oh, yes.

541
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,656
That's what I'd like
for breakfast, please.

542
00:56:56,745 --> 00:56:58,816
- All right, sir.
- Don't forget the salt this time.

543
00:56:58,945 --> 00:57:01,334
- I shan't, I shan't.
- Oh, Alma, would you like some porridge...

544
00:57:01,705 --> 00:57:03,104
- Yes.
- This morning?

545
00:57:03,225 --> 00:57:05,375
- Some for Alma as well, please.
- Right away.

546
00:57:05,585 --> 00:57:08,816
- And, um, bacon and eggs with that.
- All right, sir.

547
00:57:11,105 --> 00:57:12,300
Morning.

548
00:57:14,465 --> 00:57:16,934
I'm so hungry.

549
00:57:17,025 --> 00:57:19,141
Delighted that we have
cream in the house.

550
00:57:19,265 --> 00:57:21,461
- Yes.
- Makes all the difference.

551
00:57:21,545 --> 00:57:23,377
It's essential with porridge.

552
00:57:23,705 --> 00:57:25,537
A little bit naughty though.

553
00:57:34,865 --> 00:57:37,175
- Dear Reynolds.
- Your Royal Highness.

554
00:57:37,305 --> 00:57:39,023
- Hello.
- How beautiful you are.

555
00:57:42,585 --> 00:57:44,895
- How nice to see you again.
- Your Royal Highness.

556
00:57:44,985 --> 00:57:46,942
- Cyril!
- Your Highness.

557
00:57:47,065 --> 00:57:49,102
- Hello.
- How lovely to see you.

558
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:50,664
Good morning.

559
00:58:10,105 --> 00:58:13,939
When you dream about your
wedding dress, what is it that you dream?

560
00:58:15,025 --> 00:58:17,858
I dream that it's
the most beautiful wedding dress

561
00:58:17,945 --> 00:58:19,458
in the world.

562
00:58:20,545 --> 00:58:21,819
Naturally.

563
00:58:22,225 --> 00:58:24,296
Perhaps the only wedding dress
in the world.

564
00:58:24,545 --> 00:58:25,740
Yes.

565
00:58:27,065 --> 00:58:29,784
Or to take it just
a little step further,

566
00:58:30,185 --> 00:58:33,701
perhaps the only wedding dress
that was ever made.

567
00:58:35,905 --> 00:58:36,940
Oui.

568
00:58:38,145 --> 00:58:41,217
Is Your Royal Highness a gold
person or a silver person?

569
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:44,183
- Silver.
- Good.

570
00:58:44,585 --> 00:58:45,939
Lace or pearl?

571
00:58:46,185 --> 00:58:47,334
Lace.

572
00:58:48,905 --> 00:58:50,259
Very good.

573
00:58:50,345 --> 00:58:51,415
Merci.

574
00:59:21,785 --> 00:59:23,742
I want to wish you

575
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:27,056
good fortune for your wedding.

576
00:59:27,705 --> 00:59:28,979
Thank you.

577
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:31,618
Je m'appelle Alma.

578
00:59:33,745 --> 00:59:35,895
Lovely to meet you, Alma.

579
00:59:39,345 --> 00:59:40,619
I live here.

580
00:59:58,745 --> 01:00:00,099
Come in.

581
01:00:02,625 --> 01:00:03,854
Alma.

582
01:00:04,385 --> 01:00:05,944
Good morning, Cyril.

583
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:13,100
I wanted to ask your help in a gift
I wanted to make for Reynolds.

584
01:00:17,145 --> 01:00:19,295
I want to make him a surprise.

585
01:00:21,105 --> 01:00:24,143
If everyone left the house

586
01:00:24,905 --> 01:00:27,465
when he takes his walk
on Thursday,

587
01:00:28,545 --> 01:00:30,775
I will cook for him, dinner.

588
01:00:31,665 --> 01:00:34,384
And when he comes back,
no one will be there but me.

589
01:00:34,585 --> 01:00:36,462
I'll be waiting for him,

590
01:00:36,985 --> 01:00:40,057
I will surprise him and we
can have dinner together,

591
01:00:40,145 --> 01:00:41,544
just the two of us.

592
01:00:43,025 --> 01:00:44,459
Do you like this idea?

593
01:00:45,065 --> 01:00:46,135
Would you help me?

594
01:00:48,505 --> 01:00:50,098
It isn't his birthday.

595
01:00:51,265 --> 01:00:52,300
I know.

596
01:00:53,665 --> 01:00:55,656
I would advise
against this, Alma.

597
01:00:56,145 --> 01:00:58,659
- Why?
- Because he doesn't like surprises.

598
01:00:58,785 --> 01:01:00,696
- He does.
- Well, he won't like this one.

599
01:01:02,985 --> 01:01:04,783
I'm trying to surprise him

600
01:01:05,425 --> 01:01:07,416
and love him the way
that I want to.

601
01:01:10,945 --> 01:01:14,142
Well, if you're looking
for something kind to do,

602
01:01:14,825 --> 01:01:17,021
perhaps you could think of
something else.

603
01:01:17,665 --> 01:01:19,815
No, I really must advise
against this, Alma.

604
01:01:19,945 --> 01:01:23,984
I don't think there could be a more
inappropriate time to try something new.

605
01:01:24,065 --> 01:01:25,624
This is what I want to do,

606
01:01:25,945 --> 01:01:27,777
and I think
it will be very nice.

607
01:01:30,665 --> 01:01:32,338
I respect your advice, Cyril.

608
01:01:35,065 --> 01:01:37,215
But I have to know him
in my own way,

609
01:01:38,225 --> 01:01:40,136
and this is what
I want to do for him.

610
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:44,974
Good night.

611
01:01:45,265 --> 01:01:47,415
- Good night.
- Good night, madame.

612
01:01:48,065 --> 01:01:49,294
Good night, madame.

613
01:01:58,105 --> 01:01:59,379
Good luck.

614
01:02:38,705 --> 01:02:41,299
Oh, Alma. What is this?

615
01:02:42,105 --> 01:02:43,664
I love you, Reynolds.

616
01:02:46,705 --> 01:02:48,582
Yes, but what is this?

617
01:02:49,905 --> 01:02:51,384
It's a surprise.

618
01:02:52,865 --> 01:02:54,060
Are you hungry?

619
01:02:54,905 --> 01:02:56,100
Where is Cyril?

620
01:02:57,785 --> 01:02:59,298
I've sent everyone home.

621
01:03:01,305 --> 01:03:02,704
Where is Cyril?

622
01:03:04,585 --> 01:03:05,780
She's left.

623
01:03:05,905 --> 01:03:07,339
What time did she leave?

624
01:03:08,545 --> 01:03:09,774
This afternoon.

625
01:03:12,625 --> 01:03:14,104
I've made us dinner.

626
01:03:33,425 --> 01:03:36,224
Let me collect myself
for a moment.

627
01:03:37,705 --> 01:03:39,343
I'll just have a bath, I think.

628
01:03:41,385 --> 01:03:43,296
This is very kind of you, Alma.

629
01:03:43,705 --> 01:03:46,936
- Would you like a champagne or a martini?
- No, thank you.

630
01:03:48,905 --> 01:03:51,818
Oh, is that your dress?
It's finished.

631
01:03:52,505 --> 01:03:53,654
Let's have a look at it.

632
01:04:01,505 --> 01:04:02,654
Hmm.

633
01:04:02,745 --> 01:04:04,463
It's rather interesting.

634
01:04:05,865 --> 01:04:07,185
Very good work.

635
01:04:07,705 --> 01:04:09,457
I'll just have my bath now.

636
01:04:10,745 --> 01:04:12,338
When will Cyril get back?

637
01:04:12,705 --> 01:04:14,776
Mmm, tonight?

638
01:04:49,985 --> 01:04:52,340
How was your appointment
with the princess?

639
01:04:57,425 --> 01:05:00,417
She's very beautiful, like
a sculpture of some kind.

640
01:05:06,705 --> 01:05:07,775
Mmm-hmm.

641
01:05:10,465 --> 01:05:13,981
So will you
make her a wedding gown?

642
01:05:17,745 --> 01:05:20,100
I have made her baptism,

643
01:05:20,465 --> 01:05:23,901
her First Communion
and confirmation dresses.

644
01:05:24,585 --> 01:05:27,020
I made the dress
for her presentation at court,

645
01:05:27,105 --> 01:05:30,257
indeed the entire wardrobe
for her coming out season.

646
01:05:31,665 --> 01:05:35,420
It's only right that I should make her
wedding dress, wouldn't you think?

647
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:38,056
- Christ.
- No.

648
01:05:38,385 --> 01:05:41,218
But this is not
what I wanted to say.

649
01:05:41,305 --> 01:05:43,262
I'm sorry, I don't know
what I said, I...

650
01:05:44,225 --> 01:05:46,535
This is meant
to be a nice evening.

651
01:05:48,225 --> 01:05:49,624
Let me serve you.

652
01:06:26,625 --> 01:06:28,024
Do you like it?

653
01:06:29,945 --> 01:06:31,015
I do.

654
01:06:34,505 --> 01:06:35,700
No, you don't.

655
01:06:37,145 --> 01:06:38,704
You don't like it at all.

656
01:06:39,345 --> 01:06:41,621
Usually, you always
tell me what you think.

657
01:06:42,745 --> 01:06:44,019
What is this?

658
01:06:44,545 --> 01:06:45,694
You're lying.

659
01:06:52,025 --> 01:06:54,221
As I think you know, Alma,

660
01:06:54,305 --> 01:06:57,616
I prefer my asparagus
with oil and salt.

661
01:06:59,585 --> 01:07:03,340
And knowing this, you've prepared
the asparagus with butter.

662
01:07:03,545 --> 01:07:06,219
Now, I can imagine
in certain circumstances

663
01:07:06,305 --> 01:07:10,378
being able to pretend
that I like it made this way.

664
01:07:12,665 --> 01:07:15,544
Right now, I'm just admiring
my own gallantry

665
01:07:15,785 --> 01:07:17,776
for eating it the way
you've prepared it.

666
01:07:20,025 --> 01:07:21,618
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

667
01:07:25,345 --> 01:07:27,495
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

668
01:07:28,185 --> 01:07:32,543
I'm just waiting around
like an idiot for you.

669
01:07:34,665 --> 01:07:37,339
This was an ambush, Alma.
To what purpose?

670
01:07:38,305 --> 01:07:39,534
This is not...

671
01:07:40,105 --> 01:07:42,096
I know it's not going
as I expected.

672
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:44,102
I didn't mean
these things to come out.

673
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:45,903
I'm sorry, but it was
meant to be nice.

674
01:07:45,985 --> 01:07:47,259
Well, what did you expect?

675
01:07:47,385 --> 01:07:50,582
I wanted time with you. I
wanted to have you to myself.

676
01:07:50,825 --> 01:07:53,055
- You have me all the time.
- No.

677
01:07:53,145 --> 01:07:55,455
- What on earth are you talking about?
- I don't!

678
01:07:55,665 --> 01:07:57,417
There are always people around.

679
01:07:57,625 --> 01:08:00,185
And if not, then there's
something between us.

680
01:08:00,265 --> 01:08:01,664
- Something between us?
- Yes.

681
01:08:01,745 --> 01:08:04,214
- What?
- Some...

682
01:08:05,385 --> 01:08:07,058
- What?
- Distance!

683
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:10,819
When did this happen?

684
01:08:10,945 --> 01:08:13,380
What happened to make you
behave like this?

685
01:08:15,305 --> 01:08:17,694
Is it because you think
I don't need you?

686
01:08:20,305 --> 01:08:21,739
- Yes.
- I don't.

687
01:08:22,705 --> 01:08:24,821
Well, that's
very predictable of you.

688
01:08:25,225 --> 01:08:27,865
Don't act so tough.
I know you are not.

689
01:08:28,025 --> 01:08:31,222
Yeah, that's right. That's right.
If I don't protect myself

690
01:08:31,385 --> 01:08:33,103
somebody will come
in the middle of the night

691
01:08:33,185 --> 01:08:34,903
and take over
my corner of the room

692
01:08:34,985 --> 01:08:36,942
and ask me about
their fucking asparagus!

693
01:08:37,065 --> 01:08:39,136
- Don't be a bully. You're being a bully.
- There are other things

694
01:08:39,265 --> 01:08:41,495
- I'd like to do with my time. It's my time!
- I have no idea

695
01:08:41,625 --> 01:08:43,536
- what I'm doing here in your time!
- My time!

696
01:08:43,625 --> 01:08:44,854
What am I doing here?

697
01:08:44,945 --> 01:08:46,936
I'm standing around like
an idiot waiting for you!

698
01:08:47,025 --> 01:08:48,584
- Waiting for what?
- Waiting for you.

699
01:08:48,665 --> 01:08:50,019
Waiting for what?

700
01:08:51,265 --> 01:08:53,461
Waiting for you
to get rid of me.

701
01:08:55,105 --> 01:08:56,618
To tell me to leave.

702
01:08:56,825 --> 01:08:58,498
So tell me.

703
01:08:58,625 --> 01:09:01,981
So I don't stand around
like a fucking fool.

704
01:09:02,065 --> 01:09:03,863
Asparagus, is this all about
your asparagus?

705
01:09:03,945 --> 01:09:06,619
- No, it's not about asparagus.
- Then what the hell is it about?

706
01:09:06,745 --> 01:09:08,065
Are you a special agent

707
01:09:08,145 --> 01:09:10,864
sent here to ruin my evening
and possibly my entire life?

708
01:09:10,945 --> 01:09:12,060
Why are you so rude to me?

709
01:09:12,185 --> 01:09:14,142
- Why are you talking to me like this?
- Is this my house?

710
01:09:14,225 --> 01:09:16,296
- This is my house, isn't it?
- Yes, this is your house.

711
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:17,898
- Is this my house?
- Of course it's your house.

712
01:09:18,025 --> 01:09:20,175
- Or did somebody drop me on foreign soil.
- What a question!

713
01:09:20,265 --> 01:09:21,460
Behind enemy lines?

714
01:09:21,545 --> 01:09:23,218
- It's you who brought me here.
- I'm surrounded on all sides.

715
01:09:23,345 --> 01:09:24,983
It's you who brought me here.

716
01:09:25,065 --> 01:09:26,544
When the hell did this happen?
Who are you?

717
01:09:26,665 --> 01:09:27,939
Do you have a gun?

718
01:09:28,145 --> 01:09:29,579
You here to kill me?

719
01:09:30,025 --> 01:09:31,220
- Why are you...
- Do you have a gun?

720
01:09:31,305 --> 01:09:32,784
- Stop it!
- Where's your gun?

721
01:09:32,865 --> 01:09:34,219
- Stop being a child.
- Where's your gun?

722
01:09:34,305 --> 01:09:36,342
- Stop playing.
- Show me your gun.

723
01:09:36,545 --> 01:09:38,138
Stop playing this game!

724
01:09:38,385 --> 01:09:39,659
- I am not.
- I'm not playing a game.

725
01:09:39,785 --> 01:09:41,662
- Yes. Mmm-hmm. Uh-huh.
- What game am I playing?

726
01:09:41,945 --> 01:09:45,415
What game? What precisely
is the nature of my game?

727
01:09:45,505 --> 01:09:47,781
- You tell me.
- Oh, this whole...

728
01:09:50,425 --> 01:09:53,304
- What?
- All your rules and your walls

729
01:09:53,385 --> 01:09:55,183
and your doors and your people

730
01:09:55,265 --> 01:09:59,657
and your money and all these
clothes and everything!

731
01:09:59,745 --> 01:10:01,179
This, this, this game!

732
01:10:01,425 --> 01:10:03,894
Everything here!
The whole... Pfft!

733
01:10:04,545 --> 01:10:07,458
Nothing is normal
or natural or...

734
01:10:07,545 --> 01:10:09,502
Everything is a game!

735
01:10:11,865 --> 01:10:14,175
"Yes, mister!
No, madam! Yes."

736
01:10:16,065 --> 01:10:17,339
Well...

737
01:10:17,865 --> 01:10:19,822
- if it's my...
- "I don't eat this. I don't drink that.

738
01:10:19,985 --> 01:10:22,454
- "I don't..."
- If it's my life that you're describing,

739
01:10:22,585 --> 01:10:25,498
it's entirely up to you whether
you choose to share it or not.

740
01:10:25,585 --> 01:10:27,098
If you don't wish
to share that life,

741
01:10:27,185 --> 01:10:30,018
as apparently it's so disagreeable
to you in every respect,

742
01:10:30,105 --> 01:10:32,824
why don't you just fuck off
to back where you came from?

743
01:10:33,185 --> 01:10:34,334
Yeah.

744
01:10:53,825 --> 01:10:58,262
Sometimes it's good for him to
slow down his steps a little.

745
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:37,855
Would you like me
to ask Alma to leave?

746
01:12:41,945 --> 01:12:43,583
No. Why?

747
01:12:47,745 --> 01:12:49,782
Well, if you're going
to make her a ghost,

748
01:12:52,265 --> 01:12:53,664
go ahead and do it.

749
01:12:53,745 --> 01:12:56,339
But, please, don't let her
sit around waiting for you.

750
01:12:57,265 --> 01:12:58,824
I'm very fond of her.

751
01:12:59,945 --> 01:13:03,415
Oh, you're very fond of her, are you? In that case...

752
01:13:09,025 --> 01:13:11,619
No, don't turn it on me. I don't
want your cloud on my head.

753
01:13:11,705 --> 01:13:13,457
- Oh, shut up, Cyril.
- No, you can shut right up.

754
01:13:13,705 --> 01:13:17,016
Don't pick a fight with me, you
certainly won't come out alive.

755
01:13:17,265 --> 01:13:20,064
I'll go right through you and it'll
be you who ends up on the floor.

756
01:13:20,145 --> 01:13:21,499
Understood?

757
01:14:26,905 --> 01:14:29,545
- Morning, Pippa.
- Morning, sir.

758
01:14:35,385 --> 01:14:38,503
- Pen, book and glasses?
- Yes, they're all there for you, sir.

759
01:14:39,105 --> 01:14:41,699
- Morning, ladies.
- Good morning, sir.

760
01:15:32,425 --> 01:15:35,338
Excellent work, ladies. Um...

761
01:15:41,425 --> 01:15:43,382
It's just not very good, is it?

762
01:15:46,345 --> 01:15:47,415
It's ugly.

763
01:15:58,145 --> 01:15:59,897
You all right, sir?

764
01:16:27,425 --> 01:16:28,779
Reynolds?

765
01:16:33,385 --> 01:16:35,183
Reynolds, are you all right?

766
01:16:38,985 --> 01:16:41,499
Mr. Woodcock,
he seems to be ill.

767
01:16:42,265 --> 01:16:43,539
Who seems to be ill?

768
01:16:43,665 --> 01:16:46,623
Mr. Woodcock, he's fallen over
and he's damaged the dress.

769
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:50,455
I'm sorry, Biddy.
Who's fallen over?

770
01:16:50,545 --> 01:16:53,219
Mr. Woodcock, he's fallen over
and he's damaged the dress.

771
01:16:53,305 --> 01:16:55,262
There's stains
on the front of the skirt

772
01:16:55,345 --> 01:16:58,224
and there's a hole
in the lace on the bodice

773
01:16:58,425 --> 01:17:00,985
and there's shoe polish
on the front of the dress.

774
01:17:01,785 --> 01:17:03,423
Shoe polish from what?

775
01:17:04,225 --> 01:17:05,499
From his shoe.

776
01:17:06,905 --> 01:17:07,940
I'm fine.

777
01:17:09,265 --> 01:17:11,222
Oh, I don't know what
the hell came over me.

778
01:17:13,985 --> 01:17:15,498
Must be something I've eaten.

779
01:17:15,705 --> 01:17:17,059
Mmm-hmm.

780
01:17:23,545 --> 01:17:24,819
Oh, God.

781
01:17:29,865 --> 01:17:32,505
- You should lie down now.
- No, I'll be fine in a minute.

782
01:17:34,985 --> 01:17:37,704
- Please lie down.
- No, really, don't fuss, Alma, please.

783
01:17:37,785 --> 01:17:39,059
Just don't fuss.

784
01:17:39,185 --> 01:17:42,257
Whatever it is, if you fuss,
I'll die right here.

785
01:17:44,985 --> 01:17:46,862
I promise I won't fuss.

786
01:17:52,545 --> 01:17:54,183
Let me do that, please.

787
01:17:54,505 --> 01:17:57,338
- I have to take these off.
- Yes, I'll take them off.

788
01:18:17,665 --> 01:18:20,100
Alma? Alma?

789
01:18:20,305 --> 01:18:21,579
Yes?

790
01:18:21,665 --> 01:18:22,985
Um...

791
01:18:23,065 --> 01:18:25,534
Would you tell them
I'll be down shortly?

792
01:18:28,745 --> 01:18:30,224
Yes, of course.

793
01:19:27,665 --> 01:19:29,224
Hello, Cyril.

794
01:19:29,465 --> 01:19:30,500
Hello.

795
01:19:32,665 --> 01:19:33,939
What is it?

796
01:19:35,345 --> 01:19:37,780
I don't know what the
bloody hell came over me.

797
01:19:38,145 --> 01:19:39,943
I'll be all right in a moment.

798
01:19:40,265 --> 01:19:41,938
Oh, you don't look all right.

799
01:19:42,665 --> 01:19:43,939
Where does it hurt?

800
01:19:45,145 --> 01:19:46,499
Hurts all over.

801
01:19:47,545 --> 01:19:49,582
I've never really felt
like this before.

802
01:19:50,425 --> 01:19:52,257
Is it your stomach?
Is it something you've eaten?

803
01:19:52,345 --> 01:19:54,905
No, I don't think so.
Just sore, really.

804
01:19:55,745 --> 01:19:58,180
So please tell them
I'll be with them in a minute.

805
01:19:58,265 --> 01:20:01,178
No, you're not going anywhere.
You're to stay here and rest.

806
01:20:02,585 --> 01:20:04,178
Would you like me
to do anything?

807
01:20:05,425 --> 01:20:06,938
Just give me silence.

808
01:20:08,985 --> 01:20:12,341
- Shall I call the doctor?
- No, Cyril, you certainly will not, please.

809
01:20:12,465 --> 01:20:14,103
- All right.
- Um...

810
01:20:14,665 --> 01:20:16,702
- Exhausted yourself.
- Just give me silence.

811
01:20:16,825 --> 01:20:18,975
- Burning up.
- You take care of the dress for me.

812
01:20:19,065 --> 01:20:20,703
Yes, of course I will.
It's all right.

813
01:20:20,785 --> 01:20:22,219
I just...

814
01:20:22,625 --> 01:20:24,775
I just want...

815
01:20:27,785 --> 01:20:29,059
That's it.

816
01:20:29,265 --> 01:20:30,460
Come on, Alma.

817
01:20:49,105 --> 01:20:50,584
I think I may be sick again.

818
01:20:56,145 --> 01:20:57,544
We're gonna have
to do a lot of work

819
01:20:57,625 --> 01:21:00,219
to get this dress ready
for tomorrow, you know.

820
01:21:00,345 --> 01:21:04,339
We're gonna have to undo the front
of the dress and replace the skirt.

821
01:21:04,545 --> 01:21:06,775
We're gonna have to cut
a new panel of the satin

822
01:21:06,865 --> 01:21:08,663
and then there's also the
organza that needs to be...

823
01:21:08,745 --> 01:21:11,464
Yes, I'll deal with that
in a minute, Biddy. Thank you.

824
01:21:52,865 --> 01:21:55,698
You're soaked. We need
to change your pajamas.

825
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:05,258
I'm scared, Alma.

826
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:10,024
Yes, of course you are.

827
01:22:12,625 --> 01:22:14,616
Do you think
I'll ever get better?

828
01:22:14,985 --> 01:22:16,305
Of course.

829
01:22:17,545 --> 01:22:18,944
I'll take care of you.

830
01:22:27,345 --> 01:22:29,177
Madam, there's a telephone call.

831
01:22:47,945 --> 01:22:51,176
He's settled now, sleeping.

832
01:22:51,665 --> 01:22:54,259
- The doctor's here.
- What doctor?

833
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:56,904
The doctor I sent for.

834
01:22:57,505 --> 01:22:59,815
- Oh, no, but he doesn't...
- He needs to be examined.

835
01:23:00,465 --> 01:23:01,944
- No.
- Yes!

836
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:04,818
No, he's not dying.

837
01:23:04,905 --> 01:23:06,543
He needs to be examined.

838
01:23:07,505 --> 01:23:09,542
He's sleeping now.
That's what he needs.

839
01:23:09,625 --> 01:23:10,979
Let me be unambiguous.

840
01:23:11,065 --> 01:23:13,534
Come out of the room
and downstairs immediately.

841
01:23:15,665 --> 01:23:16,780
All right.

842
01:23:28,705 --> 01:23:30,378
Alma, this is Dr. Hardy.

843
01:23:30,625 --> 01:23:32,218
How do you do, Mrs. Woodcock?

844
01:23:33,305 --> 01:23:34,978
How do you do?

845
01:23:35,505 --> 01:23:36,734
How's he feeling?

846
01:23:36,945 --> 01:23:39,095
He's better.
He's sleeping.

847
01:23:39,425 --> 01:23:41,302
Is he able to keep
anything down yet?

848
01:23:41,665 --> 01:23:43,224
He hasn't tried yet.

849
01:23:43,385 --> 01:23:45,456
Uh, I was going
to make some soup.

850
01:23:45,785 --> 01:23:47,139
And his fever?

851
01:23:47,305 --> 01:23:48,659
It has gone down.

852
01:23:50,585 --> 01:23:52,974
- Uh, would you like me to see him?
- Yes.

853
01:23:53,305 --> 01:23:55,819
- Is that all right, Mrs. Woodcock?
- Yes, it is!

854
01:24:10,465 --> 01:24:14,379
Reynolds, Lady Baltimore has
sent her godson to see you.

855
01:24:14,585 --> 01:24:15,984
Dr. Hardy.

856
01:24:20,385 --> 01:24:22,058
Hello, Mr. Woodcock.

857
01:24:22,665 --> 01:24:24,144
May I examine you?

858
01:24:24,265 --> 01:24:25,824
Keep your hands off me.

859
01:24:26,825 --> 01:24:28,941
- I'd just like to take your temperature.
- Alma,

860
01:24:29,065 --> 01:24:31,500
there's a strange boy in the room.
Can you get him out, please?

861
01:24:31,825 --> 01:24:34,419
- I admit I do look young, but I...
- Fuck off.

862
01:24:34,745 --> 01:24:36,736
Reynolds, please,
just let him examine you.

863
01:24:36,825 --> 01:24:38,463
Yes, fuck off.

864
01:24:39,945 --> 01:24:42,505
- I think this is clear.
- Hmm.

865
01:24:42,585 --> 01:24:44,258
He wants you to fuck off.

866
01:24:46,985 --> 01:24:48,498
I'm so sorry, Doctor.

867
01:25:02,945 --> 01:25:05,414
- I'm very sorry.
- Not to worry.

868
01:25:05,785 --> 01:25:08,379
I'll drop by tomorrow morning
to see how he's coming along.

869
01:25:08,465 --> 01:25:10,263
- 9:00 a.m.?
- Yes.

870
01:25:10,345 --> 01:25:12,734
If his fever increases during
the night, you'll telephone me?

871
01:25:12,865 --> 01:25:14,264
Of course, Doctor.

872
01:25:14,425 --> 01:25:17,178
- Good night, Mrs. Woodcock.
- Good night, Doctor.

873
01:25:30,145 --> 01:25:31,294
Follow me.

874
01:26:06,785 --> 01:26:08,537
When will it be ready?

875
01:26:08,665 --> 01:26:10,702
I don't know.

876
01:26:11,265 --> 01:26:12,744
Let me put it another way.

877
01:26:12,865 --> 01:26:16,859
This dress will be ready by 9:00 a.m.
because that's when it leaves for Belgium.

878
01:26:25,185 --> 01:26:29,065
Ladies, I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid
you'll have to work late this evening.

879
01:26:29,145 --> 01:26:35,016
The dress needs to be ready by 9:00 a.m.
to make its journey to Belgium.

880
01:26:35,105 --> 01:26:38,985
Do expect to be here
for quite some time.

881
01:26:39,105 --> 01:26:42,302
If you need to use the telephone,
please use the one in my office...

882
01:26:42,465 --> 01:26:44,217
- Nana and Biddy...
- ...to alert your families.

883
01:26:44,305 --> 01:26:45,534
What can I do to help?

884
01:26:45,625 --> 01:26:48,743
Could you pin the ribbon on
the hem there, please? Thank you.

885
01:26:48,825 --> 01:26:51,897
Ladies, I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid
you'll have to work late this evening.

886
01:26:51,985 --> 01:26:53,817
The dress needs
to be ready by 9:00 a.m.

887
01:26:53,905 --> 01:26:56,897
and I know there's rather
a lot to do on it still.

888
01:26:57,065 --> 01:27:01,024
So please do expect to be here
possibly for most of the night.

889
01:27:01,145 --> 01:27:05,855
If you need to make telephone calls,
do so from my office. Thank you.

890
01:28:32,825 --> 01:28:34,736
Are you here?

891
01:28:44,505 --> 01:28:46,496
Are you always here?

892
01:28:54,025 --> 01:28:55,902
I miss you.

893
01:28:58,785 --> 01:29:01,220
I think about you all the time.

894
01:29:05,705 --> 01:29:09,175
I hear your voice
say my name when I dream.

895
01:29:10,745 --> 01:29:14,704
Then when I wake up, there are
tears streaming down my face.

896
01:29:21,745 --> 01:29:24,897
I just miss you,
it's as simple as that.

897
01:29:27,465 --> 01:29:29,854
I want to tell you everything.

898
01:29:37,585 --> 01:29:40,338
I don't understand
what you're saying.

899
01:29:44,425 --> 01:29:46,416
I can't hear your voice.

900
01:30:50,265 --> 01:30:52,063
Your fever's gone down.

901
01:32:38,865 --> 01:32:40,936
I love you, Alma.

902
01:32:42,785 --> 01:32:45,095
I don't ever want
to be without you.

903
01:32:50,585 --> 01:32:52,303
I love you.

904
01:32:55,985 --> 01:32:58,056
I have things I want to do.

905
01:33:00,265 --> 01:33:02,825
I had thought my days
were unlimited.

906
01:33:04,465 --> 01:33:07,856
The mistakes I've made
and made again,

907
01:33:08,865 --> 01:33:10,856
they can no longer be ignored.

908
01:33:11,265 --> 01:33:14,781
There are things nagging at me.
Things that now must be done.

909
01:33:17,985 --> 01:33:20,340
Things I simply
cannot do without you.

910
01:33:24,145 --> 01:33:25,783
To keep my

911
01:33:30,465 --> 01:33:32,979
sour heart from choking.

912
01:33:38,865 --> 01:33:40,822
To break a curse.

913
01:33:43,985 --> 01:33:46,738
A house that doesn't
change is a dead house.

914
01:33:53,945 --> 01:33:55,902
Alma, will you marry me?

915
01:34:07,625 --> 01:34:09,377
Will you marry me?

916
01:34:19,225 --> 01:34:21,694
What the bloody hell
are you thinking about?

917
01:34:23,105 --> 01:34:24,823
Will you marry me?

918
01:34:41,185 --> 01:34:42,459
No?

919
01:34:44,705 --> 01:34:46,059
Yes.

920
01:34:48,385 --> 01:34:50,058
Will you marry me?

921
01:34:50,145 --> 01:34:51,499
Yes, I will.

922
01:35:02,545 --> 01:35:06,334
Reynolds to Alma, when you say these
binding and contracting words,

923
01:35:06,425 --> 01:35:08,063
you'll be looking at each other.

924
01:35:08,145 --> 01:35:11,217
After all, it is each other
you are marrying and not me.

925
01:35:12,385 --> 01:35:15,980
Reynolds... I call upon
these persons here present...

926
01:35:16,745 --> 01:35:19,544
I call upon these persons
here present...

927
01:35:19,665 --> 01:35:26,901
To witness that I,
Reynolds Jeremiah Woodcock...

928
01:35:27,025 --> 01:35:29,062
Do take thee, Alma Elson...

929
01:35:29,905 --> 01:35:32,545
Do take thee, Alma Elson...

930
01:35:32,705 --> 01:35:35,094
To be my lawful wedded wife...

931
01:35:35,665 --> 01:35:38,384
To be my lawful wedded wife.

932
01:35:38,665 --> 01:35:41,578
Alma... I call upon
these persons here present...

933
01:35:42,185 --> 01:35:45,018
I call upon these persons
here present...

934
01:35:45,145 --> 01:35:47,182
To witness that I, Alma Elson...

935
01:35:47,305 --> 01:35:49,740
To witness that I, Alma Elson...

936
01:35:49,825 --> 01:35:52,385
Do take thee,
Reynolds Jeremiah Woodcock...

937
01:35:52,505 --> 01:35:55,896
Do take thee,
Reynolds Jeremiah Woodcock...

938
01:35:56,025 --> 01:35:58,016
To be my lawful wedded husband.

939
01:35:58,185 --> 01:36:00,461
To be my lawful wedded husband.

940
01:36:02,585 --> 01:36:04,656
And it now gives me
great pleasure to say...

941
01:36:04,945 --> 01:36:08,495
Congratulations.
You are now husband and wife.

942
01:36:08,905 --> 01:36:10,782
And you may kiss the bride.

943
01:36:43,825 --> 01:36:47,455
- An hour?
- Uh, an hour? That's okay.

944
01:36:49,585 --> 01:36:51,064
Cuckoo.

945
01:36:53,265 --> 01:36:54,903
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.

946
01:36:54,985 --> 01:36:57,101
- Have a good time.
- You, too.

947
01:36:58,785 --> 01:37:00,901
You, too, have a good time.

948
01:38:00,825 --> 01:38:02,384
Not for me, thank you.

949
01:38:08,465 --> 01:38:10,024
Dr. Hardy?

950
01:38:11,105 --> 01:38:13,858
- Dr. Hardy?
- Oh! Hey. Sorry, excuse me.

951
01:38:14,025 --> 01:38:16,301
Reynolds, do you
remember Dr. Hardy?

952
01:38:16,465 --> 01:38:19,537
- Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. Woodcock.
- Oh, hello.

953
01:38:19,625 --> 01:38:21,423
How do you do, Mr. Woodcock?
How are you feeling?

954
01:38:21,545 --> 01:38:24,378
I think we met in a puddle
of sweat, didn't we?

955
01:38:24,465 --> 01:38:25,819
Yes, that's right.

956
01:38:25,905 --> 01:38:27,657
I probably owe you
an apology of some kind.

957
01:38:27,785 --> 01:38:29,981
- I seem to remember barking at you.
- There's no need.

958
01:38:30,065 --> 01:38:33,137
- I've been laid siege by much worse.
- Oh, really?

959
01:38:33,385 --> 01:38:36,059
You look very healthy.
How are you feeling?

960
01:38:36,585 --> 01:38:38,462
Didn't I tell you to fuck off?

961
01:38:39,585 --> 01:38:41,064
Yes. Yes, you did.

962
01:38:41,225 --> 01:38:43,580
Dinner is served, everybody!

963
01:38:44,825 --> 01:38:46,259
Come along.

964
01:38:48,545 --> 01:38:51,458
That's your shifty-eyed godson?

965
01:38:51,545 --> 01:38:52,979
Shifty-eyed?

966
01:38:53,825 --> 01:38:56,294
He's got perfectly normal eyes.

967
01:38:56,545 --> 01:38:59,185
I'm rather less fat, I think,
than when you last saw me.

968
01:38:59,305 --> 01:39:00,579
- Really?
- Yes.

969
01:39:00,665 --> 01:39:02,303
Thank you very much indeed.

970
01:39:02,425 --> 01:39:05,543
It's fallen off me.
Ooh! I'm so sorry.

971
01:39:08,865 --> 01:39:10,697
...there are secrets nobody tells.

972
01:39:12,265 --> 01:39:17,499
Your wife has got that gorgeous
glow you get with a first marriage.

973
01:39:17,665 --> 01:39:19,417
How long will you be here for?

974
01:39:20,305 --> 01:39:23,297
Seems my godson's rather
enjoying that glow as well.

975
01:39:26,025 --> 01:39:28,255
So, what are your plans
for New Year's Eve?

976
01:39:29,185 --> 01:39:30,334
Oh, um...

977
01:39:31,345 --> 01:39:33,063
We don't have any.

978
01:39:34,545 --> 01:39:37,298
Well, you should come out for
the Chelsea Arts Club Ball.

979
01:39:40,065 --> 01:39:42,420
- I don't know what that is.
- It's not something I'd suggest

980
01:39:42,545 --> 01:39:44,218
if I didn't think you'd have
a wonderful time.

981
01:39:44,305 --> 01:39:46,103
It's really something
to be seen.

982
01:39:49,465 --> 01:39:51,695
I'll pass it on to my husband.

983
01:39:52,025 --> 01:39:53,538
But I think we'll stay in.

984
01:39:56,865 --> 01:39:58,378
Change your mind.

985
01:39:59,625 --> 01:40:02,060
Or get him to change his
mind, or whatever it takes.

986
01:40:02,145 --> 01:40:05,103
Now, please come. I promise you
the time of your life.

987
01:40:08,865 --> 01:40:10,902
How do you know
how my life has been?

988
01:40:13,385 --> 01:40:14,864
I don't.

989
01:40:16,945 --> 01:40:18,379
You're right.

990
01:40:18,945 --> 01:40:22,097
I think this would be quite a
fine time, if you'd like to come.

991
01:40:23,425 --> 01:40:26,144
She's barely looked at you
this evening, has she?

992
01:40:35,785 --> 01:40:38,504
I think they're well
and truly shaken now.

993
01:40:48,265 --> 01:40:50,142
What on earth are you doing?

994
01:40:50,265 --> 01:40:53,178
- I rolled a three.
- Yes, but that's the four pip.

995
01:40:53,305 --> 01:40:56,582
- Go back to the bar where you belong.
- Oh, sorry.

996
01:40:57,185 --> 01:40:59,096
Let's not start cheating
at this stage, Alma.

997
01:40:59,185 --> 01:41:01,415
I'm not cheating.
I don't need to cheat.

998
01:41:01,545 --> 01:41:04,776
Oh, good. You do need to be able
to count, on the other hand.

999
01:41:05,145 --> 01:41:07,819
Backgammon, by the way,
I get treble the score

1000
01:41:07,945 --> 01:41:10,221
because you haven't gotten
any checkers off the board.

1001
01:41:10,305 --> 01:41:11,420
Oh.

1002
01:41:12,425 --> 01:41:14,701
Stupid game anyway.

1003
01:41:14,825 --> 01:41:17,499
Well, maybe it seems stupid to you
now as you're currently losing,

1004
01:41:17,625 --> 01:41:20,094
but I dare say
if you were victorious,

1005
01:41:20,225 --> 01:41:22,501
I'm confident you'd see it
in a different light.

1006
01:41:22,585 --> 01:41:25,657
Now, they need your chair
for my next opponent. Next.

1007
01:41:27,545 --> 01:41:28,774
Me, please.

1008
01:41:29,385 --> 01:41:32,537
What? What are you
so cranky about?

1009
01:41:33,465 --> 01:41:35,103
Have fun with
your next opponent.

1010
01:41:35,185 --> 01:41:37,540
Why, I think I will, a lot
more than I did with you.

1011
01:41:37,865 --> 01:41:41,381
Gosh. She's
really very rude, isn't she?

1012
01:41:43,545 --> 01:41:45,297
My heart breaks for you.

1013
01:41:45,385 --> 01:41:47,183
Oh, really?

1014
01:41:47,465 --> 01:41:49,103
Being married to a toddler.

1015
01:41:51,225 --> 01:41:53,057
I don't want to be racist,

1016
01:41:53,505 --> 01:41:56,065
but, I mean, is there some sort of
custom at this time of the night

1017
01:41:56,145 --> 01:41:57,738
in her country, where...

1018
01:41:58,145 --> 01:41:59,863
- I mean, what's she doing?
- Where what?

1019
01:41:59,945 --> 01:42:02,585
I don't know. I don't know
if she's up stealing things

1020
01:42:02,665 --> 01:42:04,622
or attacking people, I mean...

1021
01:42:09,145 --> 01:42:10,897
I want to go dancing.

1022
01:42:14,265 --> 01:42:15,664
When?

1023
01:42:16,665 --> 01:42:18,144
Right now.

1024
01:42:21,545 --> 01:42:24,458
- You're joking.
- No, I'm not.

1025
01:42:26,345 --> 01:42:28,097
It's New Year's Eve.

1026
01:42:32,785 --> 01:42:34,856
Well, I'm not going dancing.

1027
01:42:39,145 --> 01:42:43,264
There's a party at the Devonshire
Hall to celebrate the New Year

1028
01:42:44,145 --> 01:42:46,375
and I want to go.

1029
01:42:49,065 --> 01:42:51,056
We need to go dancing.

1030
01:42:56,865 --> 01:42:59,141
So what are you going
to do about it?

1031
01:43:02,665 --> 01:43:06,215
I'm going to stay right here
and I'm going to work.

1032
01:44:59,345 --> 01:45:01,655
On the hour,
ladies and gentlemen!

1033
01:45:01,785 --> 01:45:05,858
Are you ready to welcome in our
lovely, glorious, Happy New Year?

1034
01:45:07,305 --> 01:45:08,978
Are you ready?

1035
01:45:09,425 --> 01:45:10,654
Here we go!

1036
01:45:10,745 --> 01:45:15,660
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

1037
01:45:15,785 --> 01:45:21,940
five, four, three, two, one!
Happy New Year!

1038
01:47:21,785 --> 01:47:23,423
How does it feel?

1039
01:47:23,665 --> 01:47:26,817
Well, I think
it feels a little big.

1040
01:47:27,345 --> 01:47:30,622
Shall we just take it in on the waist?
We can take it in a little on the waist.

1041
01:47:30,705 --> 01:47:33,504
- Yes.
- Yes, okay. Just take it out.

1042
01:47:47,785 --> 01:47:50,857
How's that feeling?
I think that's better.

1043
01:47:51,345 --> 01:47:54,064
Would you excuse me for a
minute, please, Mrs. Vaughan?

1044
01:48:27,505 --> 01:48:29,974
Where has
Henrietta Harding been?

1045
01:48:41,785 --> 01:48:44,220
- She's been to another house.
- Which one?

1046
01:48:53,265 --> 01:48:56,860
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because I didn't want to.

1047
01:49:03,185 --> 01:49:06,462
Is there something I'm unaware of?
Because as far as I can remember,

1048
01:49:06,545 --> 01:49:08,661
all I have done is
to dress her beautifully.

1049
01:49:09,065 --> 01:49:11,261
I don't think that matters
to some people.

1050
01:49:12,825 --> 01:49:15,977
I think they want what
is fashionable and chic.

1051
01:49:16,225 --> 01:49:20,662
Chic? Oh, don't you start using
that filthy little word. "Chic"?

1052
01:49:20,985 --> 01:49:23,135
Whoever invented that ought to
be spanked in public. I don't...

1053
01:49:23,385 --> 01:49:27,174
I don't even know what that word means.
What is that word? Fucking "chic"?

1054
01:49:27,985 --> 01:49:30,420
They should be hung, drawn
and quartered! Fucking "chic"!

1055
01:49:30,545 --> 01:49:32,422
It shouldn't concern you.
It does concern me.

1056
01:49:32,505 --> 01:49:35,896
It concerns me very much, Cyril,
because it's hurt my feelings.

1057
01:49:35,985 --> 01:49:38,101
It's hurt my feelings.

1058
01:49:45,945 --> 01:49:48,016
So, what's all
this moaning about?

1059
01:49:50,985 --> 01:49:52,783
I am not moaning.

1060
01:49:52,985 --> 01:49:55,943
I do not like
to be turned away from.

1061
01:49:56,425 --> 01:49:58,063
Nobody does.

1062
01:49:58,985 --> 01:50:02,296
But I don't want to hear it
because it hurts my ears.

1063
01:50:20,825 --> 01:50:24,181
I've made a terrible mistake in
my life, Cyril. I've made a...

1064
01:50:26,065 --> 01:50:29,899
I've made a terrible mistake.
I need you to help me.

1065
01:50:34,425 --> 01:50:36,336
What do you want me to do?

1066
01:50:45,145 --> 01:50:48,900
I can't work.
I can't concentrate,

1067
01:50:49,825 --> 01:50:51,816
I have no confidence.

1068
01:50:53,105 --> 01:50:56,018
She does not fit in this house.

1069
01:50:58,145 --> 01:51:01,183
We built this house,
the two of us.

1070
01:51:01,305 --> 01:51:03,455
Now, she's turning the whole
bloody place upside down.

1071
01:51:03,585 --> 01:51:05,337
She's turning me inside out.

1072
01:51:05,425 --> 01:51:07,018
She's turning you and me
against each other.

1073
01:51:07,785 --> 01:51:11,983
Her arrival has cast
a very long shadow, Cyril.

1074
01:51:16,545 --> 01:51:18,821
Mrs. Vaughan is satisfied
with the dress.

1075
01:51:19,025 --> 01:51:23,974
No one gives a tinker's fucking curse
about Mrs. Vaughan's satisfaction!

1076
01:51:28,705 --> 01:51:30,423
Thank you, Alma.

1077
01:51:33,385 --> 01:51:34,864
Not at all.

1078
01:51:41,625 --> 01:51:44,743
What a model of
politeness you two are.

1079
01:51:51,585 --> 01:51:54,976
There is an air of quiet
death in this house

1080
01:51:55,545 --> 01:51:58,344
and I do not like
the way it smells.

1081
01:55:50,345 --> 01:55:52,336
Would you like a glass of wine?

1082
01:55:52,505 --> 01:55:54,303
No, thank you.

1083
01:55:55,185 --> 01:55:57,017
Can I make you a martini?

1084
01:55:57,545 --> 01:55:59,616
Nothing for me, thanks.

1085
01:56:04,025 --> 01:56:05,538
Water?

1086
01:58:28,465 --> 01:58:31,856
I want you flat on your back.

1087
01:58:36,665 --> 01:58:38,258
Helpless.

1088
01:58:39,585 --> 01:58:40,859
Tender.

1089
01:58:42,825 --> 01:58:43,974
Open.

1090
01:58:46,465 --> 01:58:48,581
With only me to help.

1091
01:58:54,465 --> 01:58:56,900
And then I want you
strong again.

1092
01:59:02,985 --> 01:59:04,942
You're not going to die.

1093
01:59:06,825 --> 01:59:10,534
You might wish you were going to
die, but you're not going to.

1094
01:59:14,665 --> 01:59:17,100
You need
to settle down a little.

1095
01:59:36,265 --> 01:59:39,383
Kiss me, my girl,
before I'm sick.

1096
02:00:00,745 --> 02:00:04,340
I think, perhaps,
you should telephone

1097
02:00:04,465 --> 02:00:08,345
that boy doctor
of yours, just in case.

1098
02:00:10,105 --> 02:00:12,096
You don't trust me?

1099
02:00:13,145 --> 02:00:15,659
No, I do trust you.
It's just...

1100
02:00:22,865 --> 02:00:24,663
If you wish.

1101
02:00:25,185 --> 02:00:27,904
But I will make you well again.

1102
02:00:33,025 --> 02:00:34,777
I will.

1103
02:00:36,905 --> 02:00:38,657
I love you.

1104
02:00:38,945 --> 02:00:40,697
I love you, too.

1105
02:00:43,145 --> 02:00:46,183
And I think, perhaps, you should leave the room.

1106
02:00:49,265 --> 02:00:51,859
- Close the door behind you.
- Yes.

1107
02:00:52,705 --> 02:00:54,616
I'll be right outside.

1108
02:00:59,265 --> 02:01:01,575
If he didn't wake up from this,

1109
02:01:03,185 --> 02:01:05,415
if he wasn't here tomorrow,

1110
02:01:06,545 --> 02:01:08,104
no matter.

1111
02:01:08,585 --> 02:01:13,022
For I know he'd be waiting
for me in the afterlife.

1112
02:01:13,785 --> 02:01:16,379
Or some safe, celestial place

1113
02:01:17,865 --> 02:01:22,780
in this life and the next
and the next one after.

1114
02:01:23,905 --> 02:01:27,785
And for whatever there is on the
road that follows from here,

1115
02:01:28,185 --> 02:01:30,699
it would only
require my patience

1116
02:01:31,185 --> 02:01:32,858
to get to him again.

1117
02:01:34,265 --> 02:01:39,339
You see, to be in love with him
makes life no great mystery.

1118
02:01:40,905 --> 02:01:42,179
Say, "Ah."

1119
02:01:42,265 --> 02:01:43,460
Ahh.

1120
02:01:49,105 --> 02:01:50,698
Very good.

1121
02:01:52,105 --> 02:01:53,982
You can put your robe back on.

1122
02:01:59,545 --> 02:02:02,901
Sometimes I jump ahead
in our life together.

1123
02:02:05,305 --> 02:02:07,694
And I see a time near the end.

1124
02:02:09,865 --> 02:02:13,540
I can predict the future
and everything has settled.

1125
02:02:14,105 --> 02:02:18,781
And all our lovers
and children and friends

1126
02:02:18,865 --> 02:02:22,062
come back and are welcome.

1127
02:02:23,385 --> 02:02:28,221
And we have large gatherings
where everyone is laughing

1128
02:02:28,625 --> 02:02:31,139
and playing games.

1129
02:02:39,225 --> 02:02:42,616
I am older
and I see things differently,

1130
02:02:43,825 --> 02:02:46,214
and I finally understand you.

1131
02:02:51,945 --> 02:02:54,414
And I take care of your dresses.

1132
02:02:55,745 --> 02:03:00,455
Keeping them from dust
and ghosts and time.

1133
02:03:24,265 --> 02:03:27,178
Yes, but right now, we're here.

1134
02:03:28,465 --> 02:03:30,661
Yes, of course we are.

1135
02:03:34,065 --> 02:03:36,534
And I'm getting hungry.
