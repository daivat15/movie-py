1
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,933
Good morning, Constable.

2
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,086
Well done, Steed.

3
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,462
My pleasure.

4
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:00,008
But the nuns were a surprise.

5
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:01,343
We try.

6
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,476
You never can tell...

7
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,478
When the enemy will strike.

8
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,647
If we still have an enemy.

9
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:17,651
There's always an enemy, Steed.
You just have to know where to look.

10
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:21,655
Something's up at The Ministry.
They want you to meet somebody.

11
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,949
Well, they know where to find me.

12
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,326
Macaroons...

13
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:28,662
for Mother.

14
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:48,849
Good morning, Prime Minister.

15
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,934
Yes, Prime Minister.

16
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:54,813
The Prospero Program weather shield
is down.

17
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,482
Yes, all of it.

18
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,359
The entire grid.

19
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,655
Yes, it's bad.

20
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:06,742
Right away.

21
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,844
Dr. Peel?

22
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,030
"Please answer the telephone."

23
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:55,082
Good morning, Dr. Peel.
We've scheduled an appointment for you.

24
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:59,086
John Steed. Boodle's Gentlemen's Club.
One hour. Thank you.

25
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,147
May I help you, madam?

26
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,608
For Mr. John Steed, I'm Dr. Peel.

27
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,443
I'm afraid that's impossible.

28
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,445
- You are female.
- As you see.

29
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,656
Then you can't come in.

30
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,658
I have an appointment.

31
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,202
No women.

32
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:35,330
- Not in Boodle's. Not since 1762.
- Really?

33
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,929
Dr. Peel, I presume.

34
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:54,474
And you must be Steed.

35
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,978
- Please don't get up.
- And I was about to throw in the towel.

36
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,605
Spot of bother at the door.

37
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:03,150
Well, I shouldn't wonder.
Not a woman inside Boodle's since...

38
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,401
1762.

39
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,447
So what was all this? Some sort of test?

40
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,034
Congratulations. You've entered
a bastion of male privilege.

41
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,328
You're not someone
who plays by the rules.

42
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,330
Rules are made to be broken.

43
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:18,415
Not by me.

44
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,378
Play by the rules, Doctor,
or the game is nothing.

45
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,464
And just what is the game?

46
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:28,634
This is all terribly formal.
Must I go on calling you Dr. Peel?

47
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:29,718
No, no.

48
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:33,013
Under the circumstances,
you may call me Mrs. Peel.

49
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,348
Much better.

50
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,475
Now that we've settled
the matter of titles...

51
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,936
will you kindly explain
why you wished to meet me?

52
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:40,938
I didn't. Mother did.

53
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:42,689
"Mother?"

54
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:44,066
Mother.

55
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,986
Four o'clock. Mustn't be late.

56
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,029
Time for tea?

57
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:52,658
Word of warning: Don't take
the macaroon. Mother's favorite.

58
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,632
You are now entering a restricted area.

59
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,892
I always prefer a room with a view,
don't you? Tea?

60
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,228
I know about the Prospero incident.

61
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,855
Sugar, one lump.

62
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,983
- Is that why I'm here?
- You're here for tea, Mrs. Peel.

63
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,610
Welcome to The Ministry. Macaroon?

64
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:41,665
Prospero. Prospero.
Shakespeare's magician.

65
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,500
Do explain.

66
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,502
Top-secret research.

67
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:49,423
A government project I was working on
to create a weather shield.

68
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,300
A defensive umbrella.

69
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,135
I get it.

70
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,679
Someone attacks, we put up this...

71
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:57,890
umbrella...

72
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,517
everyone goes home for tea. Marvelous.

73
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:03,645
Until someone blows up the research lab.

74
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:05,898
But did they just walk in?

75
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:08,859
- How did they get past security?
- That's what's interesting.

76
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:12,613
Security cameras at the Prospero lab
picked up a picture during the attack.

77
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:15,199
Something I'd like you to see,
if you have a moment.

78
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:16,408
After tea.

79
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:18,619
Of course.

80
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,550
Well, she looks terribly familiar.

81
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,388
You're our chief suspect.

82
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,603
I'm innocent, of course.

83
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:47,064
Or guilty until proven innocent.

84
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,484
- Why would I sabotage my own project?
- You tell us.

85
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:53,987
Looks like me.

86
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,116
But it isn't.

87
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:03,705
You will be allowed the privilege
to prove your innocence.

88
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:07,251
If you didn't blow up Prospero,
find out who did.

89
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:10,295
Mother would like me
to show you the ropes.

90
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,923
He'd like us to work as a team.

91
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,301
You mean I have to trust you?

92
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:18,428
Absolutely, Mrs. Peel.

93
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:22,349
Shall we?

94
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,322
Do you think Mrs. Peel is dangerous,
Father?

95
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:39,491
All in my report, Mother.

96
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:41,618
Why haven't I read it?

97
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,954
Because I haven't given it to you.

98
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,374
My theory goes: Mrs. Peel may be ill.

99
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:48,917
Amnesia?

100
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,669
Possibly a split personality.

101
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,505
Maybe trauma. There was a husband.
Test pilot.

102
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:56,049
Missing over the Amazon. Presumed dead.

103
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,551
He was one of ours.

104
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,511
Revenge is a possible motive.

105
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:01,763
She certainly fits our profile.

106
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:06,518
- How could you have released her?
- Mrs. Peel is our only lead.

107
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,063
Either she'll lead us to the real enemy...

108
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:11,982
or they'll find her.

109
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,410
We were bombarding protons and ions
to make antimatter.

110
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,873
I shall have to start calling you
"Doctor" again.

111
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:33,462
Artificially creating new weather systems.

112
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,594
You're a lady of hidden talents, Mrs. Peel.

113
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:52,439
A little more flexibility in the wrist.

114
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,948
Scientist...

115
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:05,619
swordsman.

116
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,789
To what do you attribute
your overachievements?

117
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,085
- My father always wanted a boy.
- Oh, really?

118
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,131
I fail to see the connection.

119
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:20,592
I had a feeling you would. So did he.

120
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:32,896
Touché.

121
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:38,652
The ebony handles are a touch heavy,
Trubshaw.

122
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,904
I'll stick to the rosewood.

123
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:44,283
Excellent, sir. If you'd step this way....

124
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:49,830
Now my knight has chosen his armor.
Shouldn't we be on our way?

125
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,666
Well, Trubshaw's a man worth meeting.

126
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,626
No point in setting out half-shod.

127
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,671
That's why I ordered you a pair
of boots, Mrs. Peel.

128
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:58,839
Thank you.

129
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,342
I hope your shoes and waistcoat
please you, sir.

130
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,428
- Impeccable.
- Quite.

131
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,681
Your items will be delivered
to the usual address.

132
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:10,184
Mrs. Peel's boots?

133
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,395
- Send them on.
- Of course.

134
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:17,941
Mother suggested we go for a spin.

135
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:20,485
- Do you always listen to Mother?
- That depends.

136
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:23,238
Marvelous weather.
Not the sort of day to be stuck in town.

137
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:25,324
- I think we ought to get away.
- "We?"

138
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:26,783
Yes, just the two of us.

139
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,828
A weekend in the country,
long walks, the wind in your hair.

140
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:32,206
- How about it?
- Depends what you have in mind.

141
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:34,750
I'm a nature lover,
so whatever comes naturally.

142
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,502
Should we take my car?

143
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:49,473
That's odd.

144
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:51,558
Rusty, perhaps?

145
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,478
I hope I haven't lost the knack.

146
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:08,951
Is the pot warm?

147
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:10,077
Always.

148
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:13,497
- Milk?
- Lemon, just a twist.

149
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:17,209
No cakes, I'm afraid.
You don't mind roughing it, do you?

150
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,544
On the contrary.

151
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:21,463
- Should we be making plans for tonight?
- We are.

152
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:25,384
I thought we'd have time to pay a social
visit, since we happen to be passing.

153
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:26,885
I thought as much.

154
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:29,638
- Anyone in particular?
- Sir August de Wynter.

155
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:32,099
Former Ministry man,
head of Special Projects.

156
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:35,519
Ran our Strategic Deception lnitiative.
He's retired now.

157
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:36,979
Very rich.

158
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:38,355
Very odd.

159
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,648
Intriguing.

160
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,568
- A wealthy recluse.
- More interesting than that.

161
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:45,946
Sir August's a fanatical meteorologist.
It runs in the family.

162
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,949
Mother called April, sisters: May, June...

163
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,659
July, August.

164
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:54,413
The family does have weather on the brain.
Any other vices?

165
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:57,916
All of a piece, really.
Sir August's chairman of BROLLY:

166
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,044
British Royal Organization
for Lasting Liquid Years.

167
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:03,589
It's a private group
recruiting top scientists.

168
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:06,758
He thinks British weather has been
tampered with by aliens.

169
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:09,219
They're not too keen on him
at The Ministry.

170
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,221
- Mother tells me he left under...
- A cloud?

171
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:12,181
Naturally.

172
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:15,851
If it wouldn't be too much bother,
could you charm him a little?

173
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:17,895
I'll see what I can do.

174
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:19,563
More tea?

175
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:20,564
No, thanks.

176
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,732
I meant me.

177
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:29,406
I'll snoop around.

178
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:31,617
You distract him.

179
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:32,910
How?

180
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,161
Try...

181
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:35,704
small talk.

182
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:36,997
The weather?

183
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,958
Maybe something more feminine.
A woman's touch.

184
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,920
- That should do it.
- Think so?

185
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,172
Your confidence is overwhelming.

186
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:46,590
Such modesty.

187
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,218
A minor talent. Or hadn't you noticed?

188
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:14,219
Curious.

189
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:15,762
- Miss?
- Mrs.

190
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:17,556
Mrs.

191
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,313
- Thank you.
- Ma'am.

192
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:27,858
Hello?

193
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:41,788
Hello?

194
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:51,673
Hello?

195
00:18:58,347 --> 00:18:59,348
Hello?

196
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,311
Peel.

197
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,188
Emma Peel.

198
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:10,651
You're all wet.

199
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:15,489
Have we met, or is it just the rain
that's familiar?

200
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:18,575
We share a passion, I believe.

201
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:22,120
I have always admired a woman who is...

202
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:24,414
meteorologically inclined.

203
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:26,416
Mutual, I'm sure.

204
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:29,545
The thrill of the monsoon?

205
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:31,421
Ah, yes, the monsoons.

206
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:35,425
Even as a boy, when Nana taught me
the naming of the clouds....

207
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,344
- Cumulus.
- Yes.

208
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:39,304
- Stratocumulus.
- Oh, yes.

209
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:40,430
Nimbus.

210
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:43,767
I discovered then,
nothing beats a good lashing.

211
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:45,185
Mind your head.

212
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:46,562
Take lndia.

213
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,773
You can have a good ten inches
overnight there.

214
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,358
You know...

215
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,527
one should never fear...

216
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:55,904
being wet.

217
00:19:58,532 --> 00:19:59,783
Come this way.

218
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,328
Allow me.

219
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:04,830
These rapid climate changes.

220
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:07,708
- The Ministry needs some answers.
- Oh, that Ministry!

221
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,710
Dry enough, don't you think?

222
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:11,753
Do you mind?

223
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:13,338
Very well.

224
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:15,799
I need a specialist's opinion.

225
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:18,760
Theoretically speaking,
if I wanted to alter cloud patterns...

226
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:20,846
how would I power it?
By microtransmission?

227
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,723
Yes, by microtransmission.

228
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:26,393
The military applications were never
looked into after the Cold War.

229
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,478
The hot and the cold war.

230
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:30,022
Hot and cold war?

231
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:31,231
An outdated theory.

232
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:32,941
Intriguing, but impossible.

233
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:34,610
Nothing is impossible!

234
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,070
Only mathematically improbable.

235
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:40,365
My dear Dr. Peel, look here.

236
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:43,911
The twisted labellum.

237
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:49,208
Note the upturned apiculus
on the dorsal sepal.

238
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:51,543
A genetic impossibility.

239
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:53,712
That flower should not exist...

240
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:55,506
yet there she is.

241
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,925
I did it.

242
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,181
Beautiful, no?

243
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:08,936
Touch it, Dr. Peel.

244
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:11,271
I feel I'm wasting my time.

245
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:12,856
No, please touch it.

246
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:16,485
I'm sorry to trouble you.
It's obvious you know nothing.

247
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:18,529
I know nothing?

248
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:23,200
I have forgotten more than those fools
at The Ministry ever knew!

249
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:27,579
The ratio of protons to ions...

250
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:29,414
me!

251
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:32,543
The entire Microtransmission Theory...

252
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:33,794
me!

253
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,295
I did it all!

254
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,714
Tea?

255
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:17,671
Hello?

256
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:20,340
Hello?

257
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:22,968
Private property. No trespassing.

258
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:24,970
Sorry! I can't hear you!

259
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:27,598
Private property. No trespassing.

260
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:35,439
I say, this is a bit much!

261
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:38,775
Perhaps your friend would like to join us.

262
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:40,027
My friend?

263
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:42,821
Some rather nasty weather out there.

264
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:45,949
Perhaps he's lost.

265
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:48,285
I don't think so.

266
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:52,164
We don't get many trespassers up here.

267
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:53,248
Really?

268
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:54,708
Why not?

269
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:56,460
We shoot them.

270
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:00,130
Sugar?

271
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:47,094
Is that you, Mrs. Peel?

272
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:56,395
Manners, Mrs. Peel.

273
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:05,779
Steed?

274
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:10,033
Steed?

275
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:15,414
There you are.

276
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:16,748
Tea?

277
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:18,792
With lemon.

278
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:21,378
Grape? I bought them specially.

279
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:27,634
I hope you don't mind me taking liberties.

280
00:24:27,718 --> 00:24:29,303
I had to tuck you up in bed.

281
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:31,555
You didn't seem in good shape
when I found you.

282
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:33,140
I was frozen stiff.

283
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:36,351
Now I feel much revived.

284
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,312
Not me you should thank for that.

285
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:41,857
Actually, I wasn't about to.
I recall a very strange thing.

286
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:44,318
You tried to shoot me, didn't you?

287
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:46,278
I would never shoot you.

288
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:49,656
- Not without my reasons.
- I remember it clearly.

289
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:51,700
One shot to the heart.

290
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,660
But, luckily, my...

291
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:56,788
Trubshaw waistcoat was bulletproof.

292
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:59,708
Silly me, I thought you were
just overdressed.

293
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:02,211
"Be prepared." ls that your motto?

294
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:05,464
I thought it best to take precautions.
One never knows.

295
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:08,050
I suppose Mother warned you
about women like me.

296
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:10,594
Until now, I didn't know
there were women like you.

297
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:14,181
Obviously, I'm the sort
that doesn't take "no" for an answer.

298
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:17,809
I think that would depend entirely
on the question, Mrs. Peel.

299
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:22,856
I say, you definitely are Mrs. Peel,
aren't you?

300
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,191
You're delirious.

301
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:26,109
I should've abandoned you.

302
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:29,821
Nursing an invalid isn't my idea of fun,
after all.

303
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:32,449
I could've taken up any amount of offers.

304
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:33,534
And?

305
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:36,161
I did find a clue at Sir August's.

306
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:41,583
You see, Steed...

307
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,752
a woman's touch....

308
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:46,797
"Wonderland Weather."

309
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:53,887
Hello.

310
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:55,430
Wonderland Weather?

311
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:56,515
Yes.

312
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,019
You've been recommended by a friend who
said you'd know all about our problem.

313
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:04,815
We're awfully worried about our roses.

314
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:08,026
I don't understand.

315
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,153
My colleague and I represent...

316
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:12,322
a very influential group
of flower growers...

317
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:15,284
working under
tremendously adverse conditions.

318
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:18,412
For some years,
we've been breeding a special rose...

319
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:20,122
the Crimson Monk...

320
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:23,166
until in the past week
we've been plagued by...

321
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:24,668
ladybirds.

322
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:27,045
I thought ladybirds loved roses.

323
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:30,632
A little too much, apparently.
Now our flower show's coming up.

324
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:33,594
We need a few more warm summer days
very quickly.

325
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:35,387
Yes.

326
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:40,350
Have you seen the seven-spotted ladybird
in the mating season?

327
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:43,103
Speckled grey larvae?

328
00:26:43,854 --> 00:26:45,105
A month to...

329
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:47,524
pupate, then...

330
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:50,277
no more roses.

331
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:51,486
Voracious.

332
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,448
I hope I haven't come to the wrong place.

333
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:56,909
I was recommended
by a member of BROLLY.

334
00:26:57,701 --> 00:26:58,577
BROLLY?

335
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,829
Don't say you haven't heard of it.

336
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:03,582
I was speaking to my colleague,
Sir August.

337
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:06,543
You do know Sir August de Wynter?

338
00:27:06,877 --> 00:27:07,961
Of course.

339
00:27:10,214 --> 00:27:14,301
Welcome to Wonderland Weather,
here in our London headquarters.

340
00:27:15,344 --> 00:27:18,180
Now, allied with our colleagues
from BROLLY...

341
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:21,016
together we will make history.

342
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:30,567
You all know who I am...

343
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:32,903
and I know all of you...

344
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:35,447
but you cannot know one another.

345
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:37,115
Security...

346
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:38,909
is still paramount.

347
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:42,371
Our organization now faces...

348
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:44,581
its greatest test.

349
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:47,376
Therefore...

350
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:50,003
l demand absolute loyalty...

351
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:52,381
absolute obedience.

352
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:55,884
But if anybody wishes to resign...

353
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,011
he must do so now.

354
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:02,724
And in recognition of your work...

355
00:28:02,933 --> 00:28:06,061
a generous offer of
$1 million awaits you.

356
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,278
Now...

357
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:16,947
does anybody wish...

358
00:28:17,531 --> 00:28:18,699
to resign?

359
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:23,787
Please don't be shy.

360
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:32,254
Well.

361
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:36,383
Well, now.

362
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:39,803
We owe so much to both of you.

363
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:43,432
Without your work,
my humble project would perish.

364
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:47,853
How can I show my appreciation?

365
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:57,821
Any other business?

366
00:28:58,739 --> 00:29:01,074
- You actually sell weather here?
- Yes.

367
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:04,077
Our newest line: Summer or winter.

368
00:29:04,203 --> 00:29:08,123
Tuscany or Gstaad. Natural weather
delivered down your phone line.

369
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:10,584
All you'll need is a radio transmitter.

370
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:11,835
How real...

371
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:13,754
will it feel?

372
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:14,796
Very.

373
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:17,591
A whole new line
in personalized meteorology.

374
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:21,678
Imagine... an autumn mist, dappled
sunshine through an autumn glade.

375
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:23,472
Temperature...

376
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:24,932
Around 65°?

377
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:29,144
Whatever you fancy, sir.

378
00:29:29,228 --> 00:29:30,312
Marvelous.

379
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:33,774
A solution to matters meteorological
and horticultural...

380
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:36,026
and to my roses.

381
00:29:41,198 --> 00:29:42,115
Excuse me.

382
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:43,367
Hurry back.

383
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:24,741
Babbington, head of Prospero Research.

384
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:26,368
And?

385
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:27,411
Morton...

386
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:28,912
his assistant.

387
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:50,851
I'll take the high road.

388
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:52,769
And I'll take the low road.

389
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:44,655
Good morning.

390
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:52,746
That was a very silly thing to do.

391
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:39,520
Mrs. Peel?

392
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:54,910
- Just in time to save me from myself.
- Are you all right?

393
00:33:54,993 --> 00:33:56,995
I thought I was seeing double.

394
00:33:57,829 --> 00:33:59,414
That makes two of us.

395
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,632
So now you're saying
there are two Mrs. Peels?

396
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:11,718
- Preposterous!
- Let me handle this. I'm in charge.

397
00:34:11,802 --> 00:34:13,178
We both know who's responsible.

398
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:15,722
This story is a complete red herring.
It's quite impossible.

399
00:34:15,806 --> 00:34:19,935
Nothing is impossible. I often think
of six impossible things before breakfast.

400
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:21,895
Thank you for your contribution.

401
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:24,648
And now will you kindly allow me
to continue?

402
00:34:26,024 --> 00:34:27,860
Steed, you were saying?

403
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,530
I was saying someone's recruiting
your Prospero scientists...

404
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:33,615
under a cover organization.

405
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:36,243
But it's not Mrs. Peel.

406
00:34:36,785 --> 00:34:40,414
If you're so sure of her innocence,
do you have another suspect?

407
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:41,540
I may.

408
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:44,084
What makes you so sure of an attack?

409
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:47,296
The World Council of Ministers is meeting
on St. Swithin's Day...

410
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:48,659
the patron saint of weather...

411
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:49,715
You see?

412
00:34:49,798 --> 00:34:51,800
I do see. That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

413
00:34:51,884 --> 00:34:54,761
I saw both Mrs. Peels, with my own eyes.

414
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,767
We can't waste any more time.
He has his orders.

415
00:35:00,851 --> 00:35:02,352
I'm counting on you, Steed.

416
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:04,188
The clock is ticking.

417
00:35:52,694 --> 00:35:54,821
A perfect dress rehearsal.

418
00:36:01,245 --> 00:36:04,581
Mother and Father are convinced
an attack will take place.

419
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:09,086
Could someone like Sir August
really target a kind of weather bomb?

420
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:12,130
Queen to rook five.

421
00:36:12,256 --> 00:36:16,468
If they knew what they were doing.
It's all a question of protons and ions.

422
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:17,761
Do explain.

423
00:36:17,928 --> 00:36:21,014
Left on their own, they repel each other.
Very unstable.

424
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:22,683
Knight to knight four.

425
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:26,812
To achieve fusion,
they require a little extra oomph.

426
00:36:27,938 --> 00:36:30,607
A gentle embrace, as opposed to a clinch.

427
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:33,819
Low excitation energy,
technically speaking.

428
00:36:33,902 --> 00:36:34,987
Then, boom.

429
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:36,780
Exactly.

430
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:39,408
The pawn to knight four.

431
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:42,661
Look, I've been charting
these weather outbreaks.

432
00:36:42,828 --> 00:36:44,788
Pawn to queen's knight three.

433
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:47,583
- Are you paying attention?
- Absolutely.

434
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:49,668
A believer in firm discipline.

435
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:51,461
Do you always obey orders?

436
00:36:51,545 --> 00:36:52,546
Always.

437
00:36:52,963 --> 00:36:54,464
Except when I don't.

438
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:56,967
Knight to queen five.

439
00:36:58,635 --> 00:37:03,098
For example, if I were, perish the thought,
under orders to kill you....

440
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:06,310
- Pity you never told me.
- You never asked.

441
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:10,272
I can't mention everything.
Besides, we were getting along so well.

442
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:12,274
You didn't want to spoil the fun.

443
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:15,027
It would've put a damper on things,
don't you agree?

444
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,361
I'm intrigued.

445
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,780
Pawn to queen's bishop three.

446
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:22,451
What did you have in mind?
Nothing too messy, I hope.

447
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:25,120
No need to dwell on the unsavory aspects.

448
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:28,665
After all, according to your file,
you're a psychopathic personality...

449
00:37:28,749 --> 00:37:32,085
with schizophrenic delusions,
suffering from recurring amnesia...

450
00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:33,879
based on traumatic repression...

451
00:37:33,962 --> 00:37:37,341
leading to outbursts
of antisocial and violent behavior.

452
00:37:38,884 --> 00:37:40,469
Knight to king seven.

453
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:41,803
Check.

454
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:46,517
Is that really what you think of me?

455
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:48,435
Well...

456
00:37:48,727 --> 00:37:50,562
just my type, Mrs. Peel.

457
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:55,734
Good, because I think I found something.

458
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:59,029
You never fail to surprise me.

459
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:00,572
On this map...

460
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,159
here...

461
00:38:04,243 --> 00:38:07,246
a cluster of microclimates
around a single area.

462
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:08,872
Very, very strange.

463
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,875
Time to pay Sir August another visit.

464
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:16,213
Your move.

465
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,842
Queen takes knight.

466
00:38:21,426 --> 00:38:22,511
Checkmate.

467
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:27,057
It's just a game.

468
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:33,146
I can't hold off The Ministry much longer.

469
00:38:33,605 --> 00:38:37,526
This Mrs. Peel, I'm warning you,
don't let her get too close.

470
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:41,864
Good shot.

471
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:50,289
Don't worry. I'll take care of Mrs. Peel.

472
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:55,961
You're playing rather well today, Father.

473
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,839
- Shall we double the bet?
- Yes.

474
00:39:00,424 --> 00:39:03,051
I've never been able
to refuse you anything.

475
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:07,806
Pity.

476
00:39:08,265 --> 00:39:09,433
Just missed.

477
00:39:15,397 --> 00:39:16,398
I win again.

478
00:39:35,626 --> 00:39:39,129
I thought you lived on the edge, Mrs. Peel.
Is this as fast as you can go?

479
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:41,673
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?

480
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:44,134
We're being followed.

481
00:39:45,302 --> 00:39:46,762
What's that noise?

482
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,231
Insects.

483
00:39:57,356 --> 00:39:58,815
Bigger every year.

484
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:06,073
Sir August thinks of everything.

485
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:12,955
Hold on.

486
00:41:24,985 --> 00:41:26,069
Let's go!

487
00:42:11,782 --> 00:42:12,866
Head down.

488
00:42:55,325 --> 00:42:58,203
Would you please be so kind
as to hit the ground...

489
00:42:58,287 --> 00:43:00,372
if it's not too much trouble?

490
00:43:09,006 --> 00:43:10,632
I hope he was a baddy.

491
00:43:11,133 --> 00:43:13,427
My name's Alice.
Mother said you'd be on your way.

492
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:15,971
- John Steed.
- And this must be Mrs. Peel.

493
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:17,639
Mrs. Peel, Alice.

494
00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:22,060
How do you do?

495
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:30,194
Cocky little bastard.

496
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:31,612
Indeed.

497
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,156
- Are you with Mother or Father?
- Both, actually.

498
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:37,743
I'm glad to hear they're together at last.
They don't get along.

499
00:43:37,826 --> 00:43:40,204
Promotion, top job, most unfair.

500
00:43:41,038 --> 00:43:43,123
- Quite a fuss at The Ministry.
- You don't say.

501
00:43:43,207 --> 00:43:45,292
I think we should be on our way.

502
00:43:47,085 --> 00:43:49,630
Someone didn't want you
to get to the party.

503
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:51,882
I expect we'll have to gatecrash.

504
00:43:57,888 --> 00:43:59,932
This way. I know a back way in.

505
00:44:17,908 --> 00:44:18,992
Excuse me.

506
00:44:19,451 --> 00:44:21,703
You are a Gemini, Mrs. Peel?

507
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:24,039
How did you guess?

508
00:44:33,799 --> 00:44:36,802
Let's take separate paths.
We'll meet in the middle.

509
00:44:36,885 --> 00:44:37,886
Perfect.

510
00:44:41,598 --> 00:44:45,185
Ah, yes, it's clear now.
A love maze in a trapezoid shape.

511
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:46,770
A love maze.

512
00:44:47,062 --> 00:44:49,940
Originally late-17th-century design,
then copied.

513
00:45:01,535 --> 00:45:03,453
Over here, by your side.

514
00:45:04,204 --> 00:45:05,455
I was worried.

515
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:09,084
- How touching. Afraid you'd lost me?
- No, that you might escape.

516
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:10,502
Still suspicious?

517
00:45:10,586 --> 00:45:14,131
Just wondering if you'd brought me here
under false pretenses.

518
00:45:14,548 --> 00:45:17,301
Frankly, I'm amazed.
Perhaps I should run away.

519
00:45:17,885 --> 00:45:19,595
I'll have to give chase.

520
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:21,054
I'll hide.

521
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,431
How romantic.

522
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:23,640
Do try.

523
00:45:39,573 --> 00:45:41,158
Sir August de Wynter.

524
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:42,409
John Steed.

525
00:45:47,372 --> 00:45:50,292
An old trick I learned
from a dervish in lstanbul.

526
00:45:50,459 --> 00:45:51,710
Turkish rules.

527
00:45:52,503 --> 00:45:54,505
- If you insist.
- Then try this.

528
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,302
A man with an umbrella...

529
00:46:00,385 --> 00:46:02,137
is a man praying for rain.

530
00:46:02,221 --> 00:46:06,141
And a man without one is a fool.
Never trust the weather, Sir August.

531
00:46:07,351 --> 00:46:08,685
Rain or shine...

532
00:46:09,394 --> 00:46:10,646
all is mine.

533
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,430
So glad you could come.

534
00:46:46,056 --> 00:46:47,850
I thought I'd drop in.

535
00:46:49,434 --> 00:46:50,602
Comfortable?

536
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:52,563
How cozy.

537
00:46:53,397 --> 00:46:54,898
Just the two of us?

538
00:46:55,023 --> 00:46:57,317
Yes, like spoons in a drawer.

539
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:02,531
Perhaps I could help you,
if I knew what you wanted.

540
00:47:05,325 --> 00:47:07,035
The only thing I want...

541
00:47:07,536 --> 00:47:08,620
is you.

542
00:47:09,371 --> 00:47:10,539
How touching.

543
00:47:10,873 --> 00:47:12,249
Join me, Emma...

544
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:14,418
and we have the world.

545
00:47:15,043 --> 00:47:17,087
You would have to say "please."

546
00:47:17,629 --> 00:47:18,797
But of course.

547
00:47:19,256 --> 00:47:20,507
If you insist.

548
00:47:24,761 --> 00:47:25,762
Please.

549
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:30,142
When you awaken...

550
00:47:30,642 --> 00:47:32,644
you will remember nothing.

551
00:47:34,229 --> 00:47:35,939
Remember nothing.

552
00:47:37,232 --> 00:47:39,610
Steed? Steed, are you all right?

553
00:47:43,238 --> 00:47:45,324
I thought I was seeing double again.

554
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,491
You were.

555
00:47:46,658 --> 00:47:48,327
A Gemini, definitely.

556
00:47:49,453 --> 00:47:51,622
No time to lose. Here's the plan.

557
00:49:16,665 --> 00:49:20,794
Raffle tickets? Church fete.
Could I possibly winkle a cake out of you?

558
00:49:21,044 --> 00:49:22,504
Or perhaps a small donation?

559
00:49:22,588 --> 00:49:23,839
Not today, thank you.

560
00:49:23,922 --> 00:49:27,301
Do come. Tombola, Lucky Dip,
Pin the Tail on the Donkey...

561
00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:28,886
Nor any other day!

562
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:31,972
If you're going to be difficult,
I'm afraid I'll have to insist.

563
00:49:32,055 --> 00:49:33,515
Where's Mrs. Peel?

564
00:52:11,298 --> 00:52:12,382
Mrs. Peel?

565
00:52:21,391 --> 00:52:23,560
Don't worry, you're in my flat.

566
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:25,646
Quite safe.

567
00:52:25,729 --> 00:52:27,314
What am I doing here?

568
00:52:27,397 --> 00:52:28,482
Having tea.

569
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:30,526
Is that all?

570
00:52:30,692 --> 00:52:32,528
After a manner of speaking.

571
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:34,821
Your boots...

572
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:37,199
from Trubshaw.

573
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,665
They might be useful.

574
00:52:47,334 --> 00:52:48,418
Allow me.

575
00:52:52,548 --> 00:52:53,799
I was worried.

576
00:52:55,092 --> 00:52:56,677
What happened to you?

577
00:52:56,927 --> 00:52:59,012
I remember the maze, a house...

578
00:52:59,638 --> 00:53:00,889
some music.

579
00:53:02,224 --> 00:53:04,268
- Then nothing.
- Try to remember.

580
00:53:05,894 --> 00:53:07,062
It's very important.

581
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:09,398
I believe you're in extreme danger.

582
00:53:10,816 --> 00:53:12,776
You'd better stay here with me.

583
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:13,861
Is that wise?

584
00:53:13,944 --> 00:53:16,697
You'll be safer here.
We can talk things through.

585
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,156
An official debriefing.

586
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,658
No interruptions.

587
00:53:20,033 --> 00:53:22,244
You live alone? No Mrs. Steed?

588
00:53:22,953 --> 00:53:24,663
Well, since you ask....

589
00:53:25,789 --> 00:53:28,125
Mrs. Steed lives in Wiltshire.

590
00:53:31,211 --> 00:53:32,296
My mother.

591
00:53:33,255 --> 00:53:35,632
I had you down as a creature of habit.

592
00:53:36,091 --> 00:53:37,509
A bachelor's life.

593
00:53:37,676 --> 00:53:39,469
It's worked quite well, until now.

594
00:53:39,553 --> 00:53:41,555
Don't tell me you never met the right girl.

595
00:53:41,638 --> 00:53:42,798
There's always the exception.

596
00:53:42,806 --> 00:53:43,891
That proves the rule?

597
00:53:43,974 --> 00:53:46,852
Quite. You're exceptional in many things.

598
00:53:47,811 --> 00:53:48,729
But duty...

599
00:53:48,812 --> 00:53:50,272
comes first.

600
00:53:51,982 --> 00:53:53,609
Shall we make a start?

601
00:53:53,859 --> 00:53:55,944
A time and place for everything.

602
00:54:02,201 --> 00:54:03,160
Now...

603
00:54:04,203 --> 00:54:06,330
is definitely the time.

604
00:54:12,127 --> 00:54:13,295
And the place.

605
00:54:17,674 --> 00:54:18,759
Too tight.

606
00:54:19,593 --> 00:54:20,594
Push.

607
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:31,438
Do come in.

608
00:54:32,189 --> 00:54:33,273
I didn't hear you knock.

609
00:54:33,398 --> 00:54:37,528
We can dispense with formalities.
I want Mrs. Peel. Interrogation.

610
00:54:37,861 --> 00:54:39,613
Nothing I could do about it.

611
00:54:39,696 --> 00:54:42,366
Security restrictions,
Steed, applied to you.

612
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:45,035
Mrs. Peel is under arrest.

613
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:49,915
In you go.

614
00:54:55,337 --> 00:54:56,588
Sorry, Steed.

615
00:54:56,797 --> 00:55:00,384
Father's taken control.
She always wanted Mother off the case.

616
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:07,015
There's only one place to go,
but I'll need clearance.

617
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:08,475
I'll fix it.

618
00:55:52,561 --> 00:55:53,520
Hello?

619
00:55:53,604 --> 00:55:54,605
Hello.

620
00:55:55,564 --> 00:55:57,816
Brenda told me to expect you, Steed.

621
00:55:59,735 --> 00:56:00,694
Hello?

622
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:02,654
Talk to the pipe.

623
00:56:02,738 --> 00:56:04,239
That usually helps.

624
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,491
Colonel Jones?

625
00:56:07,075 --> 00:56:09,411
Don't worry about me being invisible.

626
00:56:09,912 --> 00:56:12,289
Other than that, I'm perfectly normal.

627
00:56:12,831 --> 00:56:13,832
I see.

628
00:56:14,082 --> 00:56:15,584
Or rather, you don't.

629
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:20,088
Learnt the trick in camouflage, till
the accident made rather a mess of things.

630
00:56:20,422 --> 00:56:21,965
Now I'm stuck away in the basement.

631
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:23,634
Lucky if I even get the tea trolley.

632
00:56:23,717 --> 00:56:25,969
I'm afraid I don't have much time.

633
00:56:26,053 --> 00:56:28,514
I'd like you to take a look at this map.

634
00:56:32,809 --> 00:56:34,895
I want to know something more about...

635
00:56:34,978 --> 00:56:36,730
the Prospero Program.

636
00:56:38,565 --> 00:56:40,150
Where'd you find this?

637
00:56:40,234 --> 00:56:41,735
Wonderland Weather.

638
00:56:43,028 --> 00:56:44,821
Retail meteorology.

639
00:56:50,285 --> 00:56:52,829
I believe you've jogged my memory, Steed.

640
00:56:53,539 --> 00:56:56,083
I may have to dig a little deeper, though.

641
00:56:58,210 --> 00:56:59,211
Shall l?

642
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:00,587
Follow me.

643
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:06,760
Hello, Mrs. Peel.
Welcome back to The Ministry.

644
00:57:06,885 --> 00:57:08,428
Now, we're going to have a talk.

645
00:57:08,512 --> 00:57:10,597
About the weather? How topical.

646
00:57:10,889 --> 00:57:12,266
It'll help pass the time.

647
00:57:12,349 --> 00:57:14,726
Time would pass anyway,
if you think about it logically.

648
00:57:14,852 --> 00:57:17,020
But so few do think logically
or even anti-logically.

649
00:57:17,104 --> 00:57:20,065
Clockwise or anti-clockwise. Tick-tock,
tock-tick. Seesaw, Margery Daw.

650
00:57:20,148 --> 00:57:24,653
It amounts to the same thing. After all,
how do you know I'm the real Mrs. Peel?

651
00:57:24,736 --> 00:57:27,114
How real do you feel, Mrs. Peel?

652
00:57:27,614 --> 00:57:28,782
I'll repeat the question...

653
00:57:28,866 --> 00:57:32,536
bypassing the weather, which,
being British, we'll return to in a moment.

654
00:57:32,619 --> 00:57:35,080
Do I walk like Mrs. Peel?
Talk like Mrs. Peel?

655
00:57:35,205 --> 00:57:37,457
Am I witty, wise, wonderful to know?

656
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:39,960
Or do I go around shooting
Ministry agents...

657
00:57:40,043 --> 00:57:42,129
attempting to rule the world
on my days off?

658
00:57:42,212 --> 00:57:44,256
Now you'rejust playing games.

659
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:55,851
Of course! The Ministry cloning program.

660
00:57:56,268 --> 00:57:59,188
Sir August ran it,
but it appears he went too far.

661
00:57:59,479 --> 00:58:01,940
Some of his more advanced experiments...

662
00:58:02,524 --> 00:58:03,859
are not too pleasant.

663
00:58:03,942 --> 00:58:05,736
So they pulled him off it.

664
00:58:06,778 --> 00:58:08,113
Anything else?

665
00:58:09,573 --> 00:58:12,201
As I recall, there was some
former Ministry land used...

666
00:58:12,284 --> 00:58:17,080
as a secret military installation
and sold by us to Sir August years ago.

667
00:58:18,332 --> 00:58:20,417
And authorized by Father.

668
00:58:21,668 --> 00:58:23,545
Eeny-meeny-miny-mole.

669
00:58:26,089 --> 00:58:27,758
And this is the site.

670
00:58:29,593 --> 00:58:30,969
But where is it?

671
00:58:31,136 --> 00:58:35,224
According to your map, it's an island
right here in the middle of London.

672
00:58:37,726 --> 00:58:40,437
It must be where he's controlling
the weather.

673
00:58:44,441 --> 00:58:46,068
Why did you never tell anyone?

674
00:58:46,151 --> 00:58:47,778
Nobody ever asked.

675
00:58:51,281 --> 00:58:54,701
These changes in weather are controlled
and aggressive.

676
00:58:55,202 --> 00:58:58,247
Yes, Prime Minister.
We're monitoring the situation.

677
00:58:58,622 --> 00:59:01,667
The Council of Ministers is now
in emergency session.

678
00:59:04,169 --> 00:59:06,713
The weather is getting worse
by the minute.

679
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:18,600
Now...

680
00:59:19,101 --> 00:59:21,353
is the winter ofyour discontent.

681
00:59:22,938 --> 00:59:24,106
Above you...

682
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:26,525
the weather is changing.

683
00:59:27,401 --> 00:59:29,319
The temperature is dropping.

684
00:59:30,362 --> 00:59:32,114
Soon it will be freezing.

685
00:59:34,199 --> 00:59:35,200
Why?

686
00:59:36,493 --> 00:59:39,997
Because the weather is no longer
in God's hands, but in mine.

687
00:59:44,501 --> 00:59:45,752
Those clouds...

688
00:59:45,836 --> 00:59:47,671
all controlled by me...

689
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:49,923
are recreating the weather.

690
00:59:51,008 --> 00:59:52,593
I have set off...

691
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:54,803
a chain reaction...

692
00:59:55,971 --> 00:59:59,558
that will paralyze
and ultimately destroy the city.

693
01:00:03,312 --> 01:00:04,688
The countdown...

694
01:00:05,314 --> 01:00:06,899
has already begun.

695
01:00:09,443 --> 01:00:11,904
And this is merely the beginning!

696
01:00:12,529 --> 01:00:14,489
This is outrageous! It's blackmail!

697
01:00:14,573 --> 01:00:15,991
Do shut up!

698
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,038
Hundreds of millions will die.
They'll drown...

699
01:00:21,788 --> 01:00:22,873
burn...

700
01:00:23,123 --> 01:00:24,208
freeze.

701
01:00:26,293 --> 01:00:27,252
You...

702
01:00:27,794 --> 01:00:29,588
and your governments...

703
01:00:29,796 --> 01:00:31,215
have no choice.

704
01:00:33,759 --> 01:00:36,011
You will buy your weather from me...

705
01:00:37,888 --> 01:00:40,349
and, by God, you'll pay for it.

706
01:00:41,141 --> 01:00:42,392
Unacceptable!

707
01:00:43,894 --> 01:00:48,315
Any attempt at interference will
only lead to automatic annihilation.

708
01:00:51,401 --> 01:00:52,861
And, by the way...

709
01:00:53,695 --> 01:00:55,656
you have until midnight...

710
01:00:57,908 --> 01:00:59,076
tonight!

711
01:01:07,709 --> 01:01:09,461
Alice, are you all right?

712
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:12,047
Sir August's demands.

713
01:01:12,214 --> 01:01:15,384
He wants them delivered
directly to the Prime Minister.

714
01:01:17,427 --> 01:01:21,181
"Ten percent of our gross national product
annually." That's preposterous.

715
01:01:21,265 --> 01:01:22,599
There will be no negotiation.

716
01:01:22,683 --> 01:01:24,226
His words exactly.

717
01:01:24,434 --> 01:01:28,480
He says unless we accept his demands,
the weather will get colder and colder...

718
01:01:28,564 --> 01:01:31,692
until we'll all have to go to hell
just to warm up.

719
01:01:32,651 --> 01:01:34,945
Did Sir August torture you, Alice?

720
01:01:36,363 --> 01:01:38,198
No, he didn't have to.

721
01:01:38,532 --> 01:01:40,033
Knows everything already.

722
01:01:40,117 --> 01:01:42,077
Breach of security, top level.

723
01:01:44,204 --> 01:01:45,289
Father.

724
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:49,585
Alert security.

725
01:01:54,006 --> 01:01:55,257
Sorry, Father.

726
01:01:55,632 --> 01:01:56,884
The game's up.

727
01:01:56,967 --> 01:01:59,887
Careful, it might go off.
We don't want another accident.

728
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:01,722
Half-working, as you are.

729
01:02:02,306 --> 01:02:05,267
Poor Mother, finally figured it out.
But too late.

730
01:02:05,392 --> 01:02:07,436
Nonsense. Mother knows best.

731
01:02:07,895 --> 01:02:09,938
I want you to release Mrs. Peel.

732
01:02:10,272 --> 01:02:11,356
Certainly.

733
01:02:11,481 --> 01:02:12,733
But which one?

734
01:02:24,494 --> 01:02:26,788
It really isn't Mother's day.

735
01:02:58,028 --> 01:02:59,488
On course to base.

736
01:02:59,613 --> 01:03:02,407
Seven degrees east, north by northwest.

737
01:03:04,368 --> 01:03:05,869
Navigation control.

738
01:03:06,203 --> 01:03:08,205
Anti-cyclone. Pull the right.

739
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:10,582
I have Mrs. Peel on board...

740
01:03:10,791 --> 01:03:12,459
and heading back to base.

741
01:03:12,543 --> 01:03:15,003
We'll keep you informed of our progress.

742
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:16,797
Message end.

743
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:49,246
The balloon, Steed. The balloon.

744
01:03:49,329 --> 01:03:50,747
Don't mind me.

745
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:16,356
You're drifting.

746
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:28,952
You're drifting off course.
You're losing altitude.

747
01:04:37,711 --> 01:04:39,463
You've drifted off course!

748
01:06:36,205 --> 01:06:38,040
Prince Charming, I presume?

749
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:39,791
Hardly, I'm afraid.

750
01:06:42,002 --> 01:06:44,546
A micro-tag concealed in your boots.

751
01:06:45,881 --> 01:06:47,049
Thank you....

752
01:06:47,257 --> 01:06:48,425
Trubshaw.

753
01:06:50,636 --> 01:06:52,095
Are you all right?

754
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:57,601
And the other Mrs. Peel?

755
01:06:58,393 --> 01:06:59,937
Dispatched, I think.

756
01:07:01,146 --> 01:07:02,397
Sad, in a way.

757
01:07:02,981 --> 01:07:04,608
Here, let me help you.

758
01:07:22,459 --> 01:07:23,710
I wonder....

759
01:07:57,327 --> 01:07:59,413
Unless I'm very much mistaken...

760
01:08:00,497 --> 01:08:02,291
that was a kiss, Steed.

761
01:08:04,418 --> 01:08:05,419
Yes.

762
01:08:06,753 --> 01:08:07,921
Technically.

763
01:08:08,672 --> 01:08:09,840
"Technically?"

764
01:08:10,007 --> 01:08:13,468
Well, I would never presume.
It was more in the spirit of...

765
01:08:13,886 --> 01:08:15,512
scientific inquiry.

766
01:08:17,014 --> 01:08:19,057
Hard evidence, you might say.

767
01:08:19,892 --> 01:08:21,602
I realized that immediately.

768
01:08:21,685 --> 01:08:23,145
Of course you did.

769
01:08:23,478 --> 01:08:25,522
I needed proof that you were...

770
01:08:27,149 --> 01:08:28,859
definitely Mrs. Peel.

771
01:08:29,776 --> 01:08:30,777
I see.

772
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:33,155
And...

773
01:08:34,615 --> 01:08:35,866
convinced?

774
01:08:37,201 --> 01:08:38,368
Well, I'm...

775
01:08:39,328 --> 01:08:40,787
still thinking.

776
01:08:41,747 --> 01:08:44,374
Dense cloud formations
moving northeast, sir.

777
01:08:45,876 --> 01:08:47,920
Some sort of radio transmitter.

778
01:08:49,713 --> 01:08:52,174
Of course we have it under control, sir.

779
01:08:54,384 --> 01:08:56,386
Not quite under control, but...

780
01:08:58,722 --> 01:08:59,806
Yes, sir.

781
01:09:00,474 --> 01:09:01,934
I understand, sir.

782
01:09:02,643 --> 01:09:05,187
Our agents are on the case right now, sir.

783
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:08,357
Two of them, sir.

784
01:09:10,067 --> 01:09:11,068
A man...

785
01:09:11,818 --> 01:09:13,362
and a woman, sir.

786
01:09:36,468 --> 01:09:37,636
According to Colonel Jones...

787
01:09:37,761 --> 01:09:41,807
this is the site of a Ministry
installation sold off years ago to...

788
01:09:41,974 --> 01:09:44,101
- Wonderland Weather, I bet.
- Quite.

789
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:14,506
Something up ahead.

790
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:24,433
Alas, poor Teddy....

791
01:10:25,142 --> 01:10:26,602
I knew him, Steed.

792
01:10:27,102 --> 01:10:28,187
Penrose...

793
01:10:29,104 --> 01:10:31,190
head of Antimatter Fission...

794
01:10:31,356 --> 01:10:32,608
at Prospero.

795
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:35,903
The teddy bears are having a picnic.

796
01:10:36,111 --> 01:10:37,613
We're getting warm.

797
01:10:46,413 --> 01:10:47,831
Seems familiar.

798
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:56,882
Mrs. Peel, you're needed.

799
01:11:01,595 --> 01:11:02,679
Excuse me.

800
01:11:03,347 --> 01:11:05,349
Equipment needs adjusting.

801
01:11:05,849 --> 01:11:07,559
Nothing broken, I hope.

802
01:11:07,726 --> 01:11:08,977
My umbrella.

803
01:11:10,395 --> 01:11:11,855
Tight fit in here.

804
01:11:12,397 --> 01:11:13,732
Allow me.

805
01:11:15,192 --> 01:11:16,985
How now, brown cow?

806
01:11:17,528 --> 01:11:18,695
Welcome.

807
01:12:00,654 --> 01:12:02,489
There must be a hatch somewhere.

808
01:12:02,573 --> 01:12:05,909
I need to locate the circuits,
break the codes and disconnect the wires.

809
01:12:05,993 --> 01:12:07,411
How will you know if it works?

810
01:12:07,494 --> 01:12:09,371
I won't, until I make the right connection.

811
01:12:09,454 --> 01:12:11,039
So much for science.

812
01:12:12,416 --> 01:12:14,126
I'll stick to swordplay.

813
01:12:20,007 --> 01:12:21,341
This must be it.

814
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:27,139
Don't wait for me.

815
01:12:27,222 --> 01:12:28,724
Perish the thought.

816
01:12:29,224 --> 01:12:30,475
Just one thing.

817
01:12:30,642 --> 01:12:31,727
Good luck?

818
01:12:31,977 --> 01:12:35,063
Something like that.
Not that you need it, of course.

819
01:13:03,884 --> 01:13:04,885
Bailey...

820
01:13:05,302 --> 01:13:06,553
take her.

821
01:13:07,804 --> 01:13:09,431
I'll attend to Steed.

822
01:15:28,779 --> 01:15:30,030
Oh, fuck!

823
01:15:44,878 --> 01:15:46,296
Weather system...

824
01:15:46,421 --> 01:15:48,465
level one and rising.

825
01:15:53,303 --> 01:15:54,471
Weather system...

826
01:15:54,555 --> 01:15:55,806
level two...

827
01:15:56,139 --> 01:15:57,391
and rising.

828
01:15:58,475 --> 01:16:00,269
Storm system activated.

829
01:16:18,829 --> 01:16:20,873
Weather system, level six...

830
01:16:21,498 --> 01:16:22,666
and rising.

831
01:16:35,262 --> 01:16:38,182
John Steed. What a horse's arse
of a name.

832
01:16:39,183 --> 01:16:41,852
Clearly, you're not a racing man,
Sir August.

833
01:16:42,186 --> 01:16:45,731
Anyway, I have no time for pleasantries.
We have a score to settle.

834
01:16:45,814 --> 01:16:48,358
Are you sure you're up for this, dear boy?

835
01:16:49,943 --> 01:16:51,528
Absolutely, old chap.

836
01:16:59,703 --> 01:17:01,246
You'll pay for that.

837
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:11,381
Target locked.

838
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:17,721
Warning.

839
01:17:18,055 --> 01:17:19,973
Weather silo activated.

840
01:17:38,242 --> 01:17:39,743
Not bad for an amateur.

841
01:17:39,826 --> 01:17:41,411
I'm not one to boast.

842
01:17:41,495 --> 01:17:43,872
Modest. And much to be modest about.

843
01:18:00,597 --> 01:18:02,391
Unauthorized entry.

844
01:18:46,393 --> 01:18:47,644
Time to die.

845
01:18:48,729 --> 01:18:49,980
Not just yet.

846
01:20:18,235 --> 01:20:19,486
Was it red...

847
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:21,321
or was it black?

848
01:20:25,033 --> 01:20:26,285
Here it goes.

849
01:20:26,952 --> 01:20:28,745
Eeny-meeny-miny....

850
01:20:36,003 --> 01:20:37,087
Shutdown.

851
01:20:38,172 --> 01:20:39,256
Shutdown.

852
01:21:07,618 --> 01:21:08,619
Here...

853
01:21:09,203 --> 01:21:10,370
Mrs. Peel.

854
01:21:11,205 --> 01:21:12,456
What kept you?

855
01:21:13,415 --> 01:21:14,583
The weather.

856
01:21:18,587 --> 01:21:19,922
Auto destruct...

857
01:21:20,464 --> 01:21:22,382
three, two, one....

858
01:21:27,304 --> 01:21:28,388
You must be joking.

859
01:21:28,514 --> 01:21:31,141
And I thought you had it all under control.

860
01:21:31,683 --> 01:21:33,101
Here. Into the pod.

861
01:21:33,185 --> 01:21:34,978
There must be a way out.

862
01:21:37,773 --> 01:21:39,024
Seal the hatch.

863
01:21:57,835 --> 01:22:01,129
Yes, sir. Confirm reports
the storm is dropping.

864
01:22:02,714 --> 01:22:05,467
A spot of internal trouble.
I took a firm grip.

865
01:22:06,009 --> 01:22:07,636
One or two casualties.

866
01:22:08,178 --> 01:22:10,097
No word yet from our people.

867
01:22:11,515 --> 01:22:12,766
Thank you, sir.

868
01:22:14,434 --> 01:22:16,478
Pity about Steed and Mrs. Peel.

869
01:22:17,396 --> 01:22:18,814
Missing in action?

870
01:22:19,857 --> 01:22:22,860
Better send out a search party.
You never can tell.

871
01:22:56,727 --> 01:22:59,188
"The owl and the pussycat went to sea."

872
01:22:59,479 --> 01:23:01,648
"ln a beautiful pea-green boat."

873
01:23:02,191 --> 01:23:03,650
A perfect morning.

874
01:23:03,734 --> 01:23:04,818
Bit chilly.

875
01:23:05,152 --> 01:23:07,321
I think we deserve some champagne.

876
01:23:16,747 --> 01:23:17,831
A toast...

877
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:19,666
to a job well done.

878
01:23:19,833 --> 01:23:21,335
To a narrow escape.

879
01:23:23,086 --> 01:23:24,171
Macaroon?

880
01:23:26,256 --> 01:23:27,674
Thank you, Steed.

881
01:23:27,925 --> 01:23:28,926
No, no.

882
01:23:29,384 --> 01:23:31,094
Thank you, Mrs. Peel.
