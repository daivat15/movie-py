1
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:18,195
And keep your retirement

2
00:03:18,196 --> 00:03:23,196
And your so-called
social security

3
00:03:25,203 --> 00:03:30,203
Big city, turn me loose
and set me free...

4
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,973
I'm Jerry Lundegaard.

5
00:03:46,974 --> 00:03:48,392
You're Jerry Lundegaard?

6
00:03:48,393 --> 00:03:49,643
Yeah.

7
00:03:49,644 --> 00:03:50,852
Shep Proudfoot said...

8
00:03:50,853 --> 00:03:54,147
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30.
What gives, man?

9
00:03:54,148 --> 00:03:55,941
Shep said 8:30.

10
00:03:55,942 --> 00:03:57,192
We've been
sitting here an hour.

11
00:03:57,193 --> 00:03:58,944
He's peed three times already.

12
00:03:58,945 --> 00:04:02,114
I'm sure sorry.
Shep told me 8:30.

13
00:04:02,115 --> 00:04:04,533
It was a mix-up,
I guess.

14
00:04:04,534 --> 00:04:05,617
You got the car?

15
00:04:05,618 --> 00:04:06,952
Yeah. You bet.

16
00:04:06,953 --> 00:04:09,621
It's out in the lot there,
brand-new, burnt umber Sierra.

17
00:04:09,622 --> 00:04:12,958
Yeah, okay.
Well, sit down, then.

18
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,126
I'm Carl Showalter.

19
00:04:14,127 --> 00:04:16,420
This is my associate,
Gaear Grimsrud.

20
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:17,921
Yeah. How you doing?

21
00:04:17,922 --> 00:04:20,465
So, we all set
on this thing, then?

22
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:22,300
Sure, Jerry. We're all set.
Why wouldn't we be?

23
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:23,802
Yeah, no, I'm sure you are.

24
00:04:23,803 --> 00:04:25,220
Shep vouched for you and all.

25
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:30,221
I got every confidence
here in you fellas.

26
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:35,105
I guess that's it, then.

27
00:04:35,106 --> 00:04:36,189
Here are the keys.

28
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,607
No, that's not it, Jerry.

29
00:04:37,608 --> 00:04:38,734
Huh?

30
00:04:38,735 --> 00:04:41,153
The new vehicle plus $40,000.

31
00:04:41,154 --> 00:04:43,822
Yeah, but the deal
was the car first,

32
00:04:43,823 --> 00:04:47,200
then the 40,000, like as
if it was the ransom.

33
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:48,368
I thought Shep told you.

34
00:04:48,369 --> 00:04:49,995
Shep didn't
tell us much, Jerry.

35
00:04:49,996 --> 00:04:51,163
Well, okay...

36
00:04:51,164 --> 00:04:53,415
Except that you were
gonna be here at 7:30.

37
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,083
Yeah, well,
that was a mix-up, then.

38
00:04:55,084 --> 00:04:56,668
Yeah, you already said that.

39
00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:00,338
Yeah, but it's not a whole
pay-in-advance deal.

40
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:04,551
See, I give you a brand-new
vehicle in advance, and then...

41
00:05:04,552 --> 00:05:06,178
I'm not gonna
debate you, Jerry.

42
00:05:06,179 --> 00:05:07,262
Okay.

43
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:09,431
I'm not gonna sit here
and debate.

44
00:05:09,432 --> 00:05:10,515
I will say this, though.

45
00:05:10,516 --> 00:05:13,310
What Shep told us didn't
make a whole lot of sense.

46
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:17,022
Oh, no. It's real sound.
It's all worked out.

47
00:05:17,023 --> 00:05:19,065
You want your own
wife kidnapped.

48
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:21,985
Yeah.

49
00:05:21,986 --> 00:05:23,695
You...

50
00:05:23,696 --> 00:05:25,572
My point is,

51
00:05:25,573 --> 00:05:28,158
you pay the ransom,
what, 80,000 bucks?

52
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:32,078
I mean, you give us half the
ransom, 40,000, you keep half.

53
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,497
It's like robbing
Peter to pay Paul.

54
00:05:33,498 --> 00:05:34,748
It doesn't make any sense.

55
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:38,251
Okay, see, it's not
me paying the ransom.

56
00:05:38,252 --> 00:05:41,046
The thing is,
my wife, she's wealthy.

57
00:05:41,047 --> 00:05:42,839
Her dad,
he's real well-off.

58
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,257
Now, I'm in a bit of trouble.

59
00:05:44,258 --> 00:05:45,842
What kind of
trouble you in, Jerry?

60
00:05:45,843 --> 00:05:49,679
Well, that's...
I'm not gonna get into...

61
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,181
See, I just need the money.

62
00:05:51,182 --> 00:05:53,391
Now, her dad,
he's real well-off.

63
00:05:53,392 --> 00:05:55,185
So, why don't you just
ask him for the money?

64
00:05:55,186 --> 00:05:56,645
Or your fucking wife, you know?

65
00:05:56,646 --> 00:05:58,104
Or your fucking wife, Jerry?

66
00:05:58,105 --> 00:06:00,106
Well...

67
00:06:00,107 --> 00:06:04,110
It's all part of this...

68
00:06:04,111 --> 00:06:05,904
They don't know I need it, see?

69
00:06:05,905 --> 00:06:09,241
Okay, so there's that. And even
if they did, I wouldn't get it,

70
00:06:09,242 --> 00:06:10,826
so there's that on top, then.

71
00:06:10,827 --> 00:06:12,118
See, these are
personal matters.

72
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:13,245
Personal matters?

73
00:06:13,246 --> 00:06:16,414
Yeah, personal matters
that needn't...

74
00:06:16,415 --> 00:06:18,250
Okay, Jerry.

75
00:06:18,251 --> 00:06:22,337
You're tasking us to perform
this mission, but you won't...

76
00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:26,174
You won't...

77
00:06:26,175 --> 00:06:31,175
Fuck it. Let's take a
look at that Cierra.

78
00:06:36,644 --> 00:06:38,395
Hon?

79
00:06:38,396 --> 00:06:41,022
Hi, hon!
Welcome back!

80
00:06:41,023 --> 00:06:42,607
How was Fargo?

81
00:06:42,608 --> 00:06:44,526
Yeah, real good.

82
00:06:44,527 --> 00:06:46,278
Dad's here.

83
00:06:48,656 --> 00:06:51,783
Leads the Badgers in goal
production with five this year.

84
00:06:51,784 --> 00:06:52,826
How you doing, Wade?

85
00:06:52,827 --> 00:06:54,035
Yeah, pretty good.

86
00:06:54,036 --> 00:06:55,120
What you watching there?

87
00:06:55,121 --> 00:06:56,246
Gophers.

88
00:06:56,247 --> 00:06:57,664
Who they playing?

89
00:06:57,665 --> 00:06:58,790
Ooh!

90
00:07:05,423 --> 00:07:07,132
Is he staying for supper, then?

91
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:09,426
Yeah. I think so.

92
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:10,635
- Dad?
- What?

93
00:07:10,636 --> 00:07:12,012
Are you staying for supper?

94
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:12,513
Yeah.

95
00:07:20,313 --> 00:07:21,980
May I be excused?

96
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:23,064
You done there?

97
00:07:23,065 --> 00:07:24,566
Uh-huh.
I'm going out.

98
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:26,401
Where are you going?
Just out.

99
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:27,652
Just McDonald's.

100
00:07:27,653 --> 00:07:30,322
Back at 9:30.
Okay.

101
00:07:30,323 --> 00:07:32,240
He just ate.
He didn't finish.

102
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:34,910
Going to McDonald's
instead of finishing here.

103
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,494
He sees his friends there.
It's okay.

104
00:07:36,495 --> 00:07:38,246
It's okay, McDonald's?

105
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:40,123
What do you think
they do there?

106
00:07:40,124 --> 00:07:42,208
They don't drink milk
shakes, I assure you.

107
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:47,209
It's okay, Dad.

108
00:07:50,217 --> 00:07:53,219
Wade, have you had
a chance to think about

109
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,846
that deal I was talking about,

110
00:07:54,847 --> 00:07:56,598
those 40 acres there,
in Wayzata?

111
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:58,099
You told me about it.

112
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,060
Yeah, you said you'd
have to think about it.

113
00:08:00,061 --> 00:08:01,603
I understand.
It's a lot of money.

114
00:08:01,604 --> 00:08:04,606
It's a heck of a lot. What did you
say you were gonna put there?

115
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,982
A lot. It's a...

116
00:08:05,983 --> 00:08:07,525
I know it's a lot.

117
00:08:07,526 --> 00:08:08,735
I mean a parking lot.

118
00:08:08,736 --> 00:08:12,489
Well, 750,000 is a lot.

119
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,782
Yeah, well,
it's a chunk, but...

120
00:08:13,783 --> 00:08:16,868
I had a couple lots, late 50s.
Lost a lot of money.

121
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:18,620
A lot of money.
Yeah, but the difference...

122
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:20,872
I thought you were gonna
show it to Stan Grossman.

123
00:08:20,873 --> 00:08:23,208
He passes on this stuff before
it gets kicked up to me.

124
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:25,835
Well, Stan'll say, "No dice."
That's why you pay him.

125
00:08:25,836 --> 00:08:28,546
I'm asking you here, Wade.

126
00:08:28,547 --> 00:08:32,467
This could work out real good
for me and Jean and Scotty.

127
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:37,468
Jean and Scotty
never have to worry.

128
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,071
Where is Pancakes House?

129
00:08:53,072 --> 00:08:54,155
What?

130
00:08:54,156 --> 00:08:57,701
We stop at Pancakes House.

131
00:08:57,702 --> 00:09:00,120
What are you, nuts? We had
pancakes for breakfast.

132
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:01,830
Gotta go to a place
where I can get a shot

133
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:03,456
and a beer and a steak, maybe.

134
00:09:03,457 --> 00:09:08,457
Not more fucking pancakes.
Come on.

135
00:09:10,923 --> 00:09:14,384
Oh, come on, man.

136
00:09:14,385 --> 00:09:16,761
Okay. Here's an idea.

137
00:09:16,762 --> 00:09:18,096
We can stop
outside of Brainerd.

138
00:09:18,097 --> 00:09:20,473
I know a place there where we can get laid.
What do you think?

139
00:09:20,474 --> 00:09:22,475
I'm fucking
hungry now, you know.

140
00:09:22,476 --> 00:09:26,271
Yeah, yeah, Jesus. I'm saying
we can stop, get pancakes,

141
00:09:26,272 --> 00:09:31,272
and then we'll
get laid, all right?

142
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:41,619
Lou Diamond, line one.

143
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,121
We sat right here in this room

144
00:09:43,122 --> 00:09:44,622
and went over
this and over this.

145
00:09:44,623 --> 00:09:45,790
Yeah, but that TruCoat...

146
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,793
I sat right here and said I
didn't want any TruCoat.

147
00:09:48,794 --> 00:09:50,837
Yeah, but I'm saying
that TruCoat.

148
00:09:50,838 --> 00:09:52,964
You don't get it,
you get oxidation problems.

149
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:54,549
It'll cost you a heck of
a lot more than $500.

150
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,717
You're sitting there.

151
00:09:55,718 --> 00:09:56,801
You're talking in circles.

152
00:09:56,802 --> 00:09:58,762
You're talking like we
didn't go over this already.

153
00:09:58,763 --> 00:09:59,929
Yeah, but this TruCoat...

154
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,140
We had a deal here for 19,500.

155
00:10:02,141 --> 00:10:03,933
You sat there and darned
if you didn't tell me

156
00:10:03,934 --> 00:10:05,727
you'd get me this car,
these options,

157
00:10:05,728 --> 00:10:07,687
without the sealant,
for 19,500.

158
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:09,272
All right,
I'm not saying I didn't.

159
00:10:09,273 --> 00:10:10,899
You called me
20 minutes ago and said

160
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,650
you had it ready
to make delivery.

161
00:10:12,651 --> 00:10:14,402
You says, "Come on
down and get it."

162
00:10:14,403 --> 00:10:18,615
And here you are, and you're wasting
my time and my wife's time,

163
00:10:18,616 --> 00:10:22,243
and I'm paying 19,500
for this vehicle here.

164
00:10:22,244 --> 00:10:24,329
All right.

165
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:29,330
I'll talk to my boss.

166
00:10:29,418 --> 00:10:31,795
See, they install that
TruCoat at the factory.

167
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:36,424
There's nothing we can do,
but I'll talk to my boss.

168
00:10:36,425 --> 00:10:39,844
These guys here.
These guys.

169
00:10:39,845 --> 00:10:43,515
It's always the same.
It's always more.

170
00:10:46,811 --> 00:10:48,478
You going to
the Gophers on Sunday?

171
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:50,021
Oh, you betcha.

172
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:53,441
You wouldn't have
an extra ticket?

173
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:56,778
You kidding?

174
00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:00,698
Well,

175
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:02,450
he never done this before,

176
00:11:02,451 --> 00:11:05,286
but seeing as it's special
circumstances and all,

177
00:11:05,287 --> 00:11:09,958
he says I can knock
$100 off that TruCoat.

178
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,085
100?

179
00:11:12,086 --> 00:11:14,420
You lied to me,
Mr. Lundegaard.

180
00:11:14,421 --> 00:11:16,297
You're a bald-faced liar.

181
00:11:16,298 --> 00:11:18,007
Bucky, please.

182
00:11:18,008 --> 00:11:20,677
A fucking liar.

183
00:11:20,678 --> 00:11:23,096
Bucky, please.

184
00:11:23,097 --> 00:11:24,889
Where's my goddamn checkbook?

185
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,725
Let's get this over with.

186
00:11:27,726 --> 00:11:32,726
Where is it?

187
00:12:04,138 --> 00:12:09,138
From Hollywood,
The Tonight Show, starring...

188
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:12,854
I am talking
about your potential.

189
00:12:12,855 --> 00:12:14,439
Mmm-hmm.

190
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,774
You're not a C student.

191
00:12:16,775 --> 00:12:18,276
Yeah.

192
00:12:18,277 --> 00:12:20,778
Yet you're getting C grades.

193
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:23,823
It's that disparity there that
concerns your dad and me.

194
00:12:23,824 --> 00:12:25,617
Uh-huh.

195
00:12:25,618 --> 00:12:27,327
You know what a disparity is?

196
00:12:27,328 --> 00:12:28,453
Yeah!

197
00:12:28,454 --> 00:12:30,663
Okay! Well,
that's why we...

198
00:12:30,664 --> 00:12:33,082
We don't want you
going out for hockey.

199
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,459
Oh, man!

200
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,502
Come on. What's the big deal?
It's just an hour...

201
00:12:36,503 --> 00:12:38,338
Hold on.

202
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:39,672
What's the big deal?

203
00:12:39,673 --> 00:12:40,840
Hello?

204
00:12:40,841 --> 00:12:42,759
Yeah, hiya, hon.
Oh, hi, Dad.

205
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,927
Is Jerry around?

206
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:45,887
Yeah. Hon!
Yeah, he's here.

207
00:12:45,888 --> 00:12:47,180
Yeah, I'll catch him for you.

208
00:12:47,181 --> 00:12:48,431
- Hon!
- Yeah?

209
00:12:48,432 --> 00:12:50,099
It's Dad.
Okay.

210
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,143
Look, Dad,
there's no fucking way...

211
00:12:52,144 --> 00:12:53,186
Scotty!

212
00:12:53,187 --> 00:12:55,647
Hey, let's watch
that language there.

213
00:12:55,648 --> 00:12:56,856
How you doing there, Wade?

214
00:12:56,857 --> 00:12:58,066
What's going on there?

215
00:12:58,067 --> 00:13:00,485
Nothing, Wade.
How you doing there?

216
00:13:00,486 --> 00:13:02,654
Stan Grossman
looked at your proposal.

217
00:13:02,655 --> 00:13:03,988
He says it's pretty sweet.

218
00:13:03,989 --> 00:13:05,114
No kidding?

219
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:06,824
Might be interested.

220
00:13:06,825 --> 00:13:10,828
No kidding? I'd need the
cash pretty quick there,

221
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:12,372
in order to close the deal.

222
00:13:12,373 --> 00:13:14,123
Come by at 2:30.
We'll talk about it.

223
00:13:14,124 --> 00:13:17,252
If your numbers are right,
Stan says it's pretty sweet.

224
00:13:17,253 --> 00:13:19,170
Stan, you know, Grossman.
Yeah.

225
00:13:19,171 --> 00:13:20,255
2130.

226
00:13:20,256 --> 00:13:25,256
Yeah. Okay.

227
00:13:36,021 --> 00:13:38,106
Say, Shep, how you doing there?

228
00:13:38,107 --> 00:13:40,066
Say, you know those two fellas

229
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:41,859
you put me in touch
with up there in Fargo?

230
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,569
I put you in
touch with Grimsrud.

231
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,363
Yeah, well, he had
a buddy there.

232
00:13:45,364 --> 00:13:46,656
He...
Then I don't vouch for him.

233
00:13:46,657 --> 00:13:47,824
Well, that's okay.

234
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:50,076
I vouch for Grimsrud.
Who's his buddy?

235
00:13:50,077 --> 00:13:51,744
Carl something.

236
00:13:51,745 --> 00:13:53,288
Never heard of him.
Don't vouch for him.

237
00:13:53,289 --> 00:13:56,332
Well, that's okay. He's a buddy
of the guy you vouched for,

238
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,834
so I'm not worried.
I just...

239
00:13:57,835 --> 00:14:00,336
I was wondering, see, I got
to get in touch with him.

240
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:04,340
See, this deal I needed him
for, I may not need it anymore.

241
00:14:04,341 --> 00:14:06,384
Something's happening, see.
Call him up.

242
00:14:06,385 --> 00:14:09,887
Yeah, well, see, I did that, and
I haven't been able to get him,

243
00:14:09,888 --> 00:14:13,141
so I thought maybe you'd know an
alternate number, or what have you.

244
00:14:13,142 --> 00:14:14,225
Nope.

245
00:14:14,226 --> 00:14:16,102
Okay. Well...

246
00:14:16,103 --> 00:14:21,103
Real good, then.

247
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:42,170
Can you crack a fucking
window open, man?

248
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:46,257
You know, it's proven
that secondhand smoke is...

249
00:14:46,258 --> 00:14:49,927
You know, a cancer agent.

250
00:14:49,928 --> 00:14:52,263
Hey, look at that.
Twin Cities.

251
00:14:52,264 --> 00:14:53,931
That's the IDS Building,
the big glass one.

252
00:14:53,932 --> 00:14:58,932
Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest
after the Sears in Chicago,

253
00:14:59,063 --> 00:15:01,773
or John Hancock building,
whatever.

254
00:15:01,774 --> 00:15:04,400
You ever been to Minneapolis?

255
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:08,112
No.

256
00:15:08,113 --> 00:15:11,240
Would it kill you
to say something?

257
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:12,867
I did.

258
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:17,372
"No." That's the first thing you've
said in the last four hours.

259
00:15:17,373 --> 00:15:18,790
That's a...

260
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,459
That's a fountain
of conversation, man.

261
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,211
That's a geyser.

262
00:15:23,212 --> 00:15:27,465
I mean, whoa, daddy.
Stand back, man.

263
00:15:27,466 --> 00:15:29,008
Shit.

264
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:30,843
I'm sitting here driving.

265
00:15:30,844 --> 00:15:32,303
I'm doing all the driving, man,

266
00:15:32,304 --> 00:15:34,138
whole fucking way
from Brainerd, driving.

267
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:37,100
Just trying to chat.

268
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:39,602
You know, keep our spirits up,

269
00:15:39,603 --> 00:15:40,770
fight the boredom of the road,

270
00:15:40,771 --> 00:15:45,771
and you can't say one fucking thing
just in the way of conversation?

271
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:49,153
Oh, fuck it. I don't
have to talk either, man.

272
00:15:49,154 --> 00:15:54,154
See how you like it.

273
00:15:54,785 --> 00:15:56,828
Just total fucking silence.

274
00:15:56,829 --> 00:15:59,288
Two could play at
that game, smart guy.

275
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:04,085
We'll just see how you like it.

276
00:16:04,086 --> 00:16:08,005
Total silence.

277
00:16:08,006 --> 00:16:11,342
Mr. Lundegaard, this is
Reilly Diefenbach from GMAC.

278
00:16:11,343 --> 00:16:12,593
How are you this morning?

279
00:16:12,594 --> 00:16:13,970
Real good.
How you doing?

280
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:15,471
Pretty good,
Mr. Lundegaard.

281
00:16:15,472 --> 00:16:17,557
You're damn hard
to get on the phone.

282
00:16:17,558 --> 00:16:20,101
It's pretty darn busy here, but
that's the way we like it.

283
00:16:20,102 --> 00:16:21,185
Well, that's for sure.

284
00:16:21,186 --> 00:16:23,187
Now, I just need on these last,

285
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:25,356
these financing documents
that you sent us,

286
00:16:25,357 --> 00:16:27,567
I can't read the serial
numbers of the vehicles.

287
00:16:27,568 --> 00:16:28,985
Yeah, but I already got the...

288
00:16:28,986 --> 00:16:30,486
It's okay.
The loans are in place.

289
00:16:30,487 --> 00:16:32,321
I already got the...
What? The...

290
00:16:32,322 --> 00:16:33,656
Yeah, the 320,000.

291
00:16:33,657 --> 00:16:35,199
You got the money last month.

292
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,659
Yeah, so we're all set, then.

293
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,953
Yeah, but the vehicles
that you're borrowing on,

294
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:41,956
I just can't read the serial
numbers on your application.

295
00:16:41,957 --> 00:16:43,207
Maybe if you could just read...

296
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,333
Yeah, but the deal's
already done.

297
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:45,543
I already got the money.

298
00:16:45,544 --> 00:16:47,044
Yes, but if we have
an audit here,

299
00:16:47,045 --> 00:16:48,546
I just have to know
that these vehicles

300
00:16:48,547 --> 00:16:49,922
you're financing
with this money,

301
00:16:49,923 --> 00:16:51,340
that they really exist.

302
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:53,634
Yeah, well,
they exist, all right.

303
00:16:53,635 --> 00:16:55,386
I'm sure they do,

304
00:16:55,387 --> 00:16:58,848
but I can't read the serial numbers
here, so if you could read me...

305
00:16:58,849 --> 00:17:02,393
Yeah, but... See...

306
00:17:02,394 --> 00:17:03,728
I don't have
them in front of me.

307
00:17:03,729 --> 00:17:05,313
Why don't I just
fax you over a copy?

308
00:17:05,314 --> 00:17:06,981
No, well, no, fax is no good.

309
00:17:06,982 --> 00:17:09,066
That's what I have, and I
can't read the darn thing.

310
00:17:09,067 --> 00:17:11,903
Yeah, okay. I'll have my girl
send you a copy, then.

311
00:17:11,904 --> 00:17:15,281
Okay, because if I can't correlate
this note with the specific vehicles,

312
00:17:15,282 --> 00:17:17,408
then I got to
call back that money.

313
00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:18,910
Yeah, how much money was that?

314
00:17:18,911 --> 00:17:21,913
320,000. I got to
correlate that money

315
00:17:21,914 --> 00:17:23,414
with the cars
it's being lent on.

316
00:17:23,415 --> 00:17:25,625
Yeah. Okay, no problem. I'll
just fax that right over.

317
00:17:25,626 --> 00:17:26,709
No, no, no. Fax...

318
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,586
I mean, send it over. I'll shoot
it right over to you, then.

319
00:17:28,587 --> 00:17:29,754
Okay, okay. Fine.

320
00:17:29,755 --> 00:17:34,755
Okay. Real good, then.

321
00:17:38,138 --> 00:17:40,097
We're back with Katie Carlson.
Hi.

322
00:17:40,098 --> 00:17:41,224
Now, before we get going here,

323
00:17:41,225 --> 00:17:43,267
we just want to remind all
of our viewers at home

324
00:17:43,268 --> 00:17:45,436
that this March, for the
second year in a row,

325
00:17:45,437 --> 00:17:47,813
Katie and I, along
with Twin City Travel,

326
00:17:47,814 --> 00:17:50,525
will be leading a two-week
riverboat trip down the Nile.

327
00:17:50,526 --> 00:17:52,401
It's a terrific time. I
know you've heard about it.

328
00:17:52,402 --> 00:17:56,113
We want all of you
to come with,

329
00:17:56,114 --> 00:17:57,448
and that's the truth.

330
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:01,118
Okay, now, for those of
you that just joined us,

331
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,662
Katie here, this morning,
is going to show us

332
00:18:02,663 --> 00:18:05,873
how to make Holidazzle
eggs ourselves, at home.

333
00:18:05,874 --> 00:18:07,792
Now, Katie, I gotta admit...
What?

334
00:18:07,793 --> 00:18:10,336
I was a little bit surprised
when I first picked this up.

335
00:18:10,337 --> 00:18:11,420
Right.

336
00:18:11,421 --> 00:18:12,505
This is an empty egg.

337
00:18:12,506 --> 00:18:13,798
That's right, Dale.

338
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:14,882
Well, how do you get the egg...

339
00:18:14,883 --> 00:18:16,217
There was an egg in here, right?
Yeah.

340
00:18:16,218 --> 00:18:19,136
Okay, well, I don't... How do you...
I mean, you don't have

341
00:18:19,137 --> 00:18:22,139
an empty chicken somewhere
that lays empty eggs?

342
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,516
No, no.

343
00:18:23,517 --> 00:18:26,394
I guarantee, this was
an honest-to-goodness...

344
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:42,243
Unguent

345
00:18:42,244 --> 00:18:43,327
What?

346
00:18:43,328 --> 00:18:48,328
I need unguent.

347
00:18:51,461 --> 00:18:53,838
No.

348
00:19:00,762 --> 00:19:03,931
No...

349
00:19:25,037 --> 00:19:26,370
You want to do it?

350
00:19:26,371 --> 00:19:26,871
Push.

351
00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:29,684
How are you, Stan?
How you doing, Wade?

352
00:20:29,685 --> 00:20:31,727
Good to see you again, Jerry.

353
00:20:31,728 --> 00:20:34,355
If these numbers are right,
this looks pretty sweet.

354
00:20:34,356 --> 00:20:35,815
Those numbers
are right, all right.

355
00:20:35,816 --> 00:20:36,941
Believe me.

356
00:20:36,942 --> 00:20:38,192
This is doable.

357
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:39,485
Congratulations, Jer.

358
00:20:39,486 --> 00:20:41,445
Yeah, thanks, Stan.
Well, it's a pretty...

359
00:20:41,446 --> 00:20:45,324
What kind of finder's fee
were you looking for?

360
00:20:45,325 --> 00:20:46,867
Huh?

361
00:20:46,868 --> 00:20:49,286
The financials
are pretty thorough,

362
00:20:49,287 --> 00:20:52,248
so the only thing
we don't know is your fee.

363
00:20:52,249 --> 00:20:54,291
My fee?

364
00:20:54,292 --> 00:20:56,377
Wade, what the heck
are you talking about?

365
00:20:56,378 --> 00:20:57,795
Stan and I are okay.

366
00:20:57,796 --> 00:20:59,755
Yeah.
We're good to load in.

367
00:20:59,756 --> 00:21:01,257
Yeah.

368
00:21:01,258 --> 00:21:04,969
But we never talked about your
fee for bringing it to us.

369
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,388
No, but, Wade, see, I was
bringing you this deal

370
00:21:07,389 --> 00:21:08,848
for you to loan me
the money to put in.

371
00:21:08,849 --> 00:21:12,810
It's my deal here, see.

372
00:21:12,811 --> 00:21:15,146
Jerry, we thought you were
bringing us an investment.

373
00:21:15,147 --> 00:21:16,689
Yeah. Right.

374
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,983
You're saying...

375
00:21:18,984 --> 00:21:20,109
What are you saying?

376
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,444
You're saying
we put in all the money,

377
00:21:21,445 --> 00:21:22,945
and you collect
when it pays off.

378
00:21:25,282 --> 00:21:27,491
No, no. See... But I'd...

379
00:21:27,492 --> 00:21:30,202
I'd pay you back the
principal and interest.

380
00:21:30,203 --> 00:21:33,247
Heck, I'd go one over prime?

381
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:34,498
We're not a bank, Jerry.

382
00:21:34,499 --> 00:21:36,625
If I wanted bank
interest on 750,000,

383
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:39,670
I'd go to Midwest Federal,
talk to old Bill Diehl.

384
00:21:39,671 --> 00:21:41,130
He's at North Star.
He's at...

385
00:21:41,131 --> 00:21:44,049
No, no. See, L“

386
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,636
I don't need a finder's fee.
I need...

387
00:21:47,637 --> 00:21:49,680
Finder's fee is, what, 10%?

388
00:21:49,681 --> 00:21:51,182
Heck, that's not
gonna do it for me.

389
00:21:51,183 --> 00:21:52,391
I need the principal.

390
00:21:52,392 --> 00:21:55,728
Well, Jerry, we're not gonna
just give you $750,000.

391
00:21:55,729 --> 00:21:57,271
What the heck
were you thinking?

392
00:21:57,272 --> 00:21:58,647
If I'm only
getting bank interest,

393
00:21:58,648 --> 00:22:01,525
I want complete security.
Heck, FDIC.

394
00:22:01,526 --> 00:22:03,027
I don't see nothing
like that here.

395
00:22:03,028 --> 00:22:07,281
Yeah, but I...

396
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:08,741
Okay. I...

397
00:22:08,742 --> 00:22:10,576
I guarantee you
your money back.

398
00:22:10,577 --> 00:22:13,871
I'm not talking about
your damn word, Jerry.

399
00:22:13,872 --> 00:22:15,206
Jeez!
What the heck are you...

400
00:22:15,207 --> 00:22:17,458
We're not a bank, Jerry.

401
00:22:17,459 --> 00:22:20,044
Well, look. I don't want to
out you out of the loop,

402
00:22:20,045 --> 00:22:22,630
but this here's a good deal.

403
00:22:22,631 --> 00:22:24,882
I assume,
if you're not interested,

404
00:22:24,883 --> 00:22:29,883
you won't mind if we move
on it independently.

405
00:23:29,281 --> 00:23:30,781
Damn it!

406
00:24:01,897 --> 00:24:05,649
Hon?

407
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:10,650
I got the groceries!

408
00:24:44,022 --> 00:24:49,022
Yeah, Wade, hi.
It's Jerry. I...

409
00:24:49,694 --> 00:24:53,530
Wade, it's Jerry. I don't
know what to do. It's Jean.

410
00:24:53,531 --> 00:24:56,200
I don't know what to do.
It's my wife.

411
00:24:56,201 --> 00:25:00,704
I don't know what to do.
It's Jean.

412
00:25:00,705 --> 00:25:05,705
Yeah, Wade, I...
It's Jerry. I...

413
00:25:06,044 --> 00:25:08,796
Wade, it's Jerry.
I... We gotta talk.

414
00:25:08,797 --> 00:25:13,797
It's something...
Jeez. It's terrible.

415
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:27,060
Yeah, Wade Gustafson, please.

416
00:26:00,056 --> 00:26:02,224
Shut the fuck up,

417
00:26:02,225 --> 00:26:04,935
or I'll throw you back
into the trunk, you know.

418
00:26:04,936 --> 00:26:09,936
Jesus, that's more than
I've heard you say all week.

419
00:26:15,864 --> 00:26:16,364
Shit.

420
00:26:20,118 --> 00:26:25,118
Oh, the tags.

421
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:29,460
All right, it's just the tags.

422
00:26:29,461 --> 00:26:33,672
I never put my tags on the car.

423
00:26:33,673 --> 00:26:38,673
All right, don't worry.
I'll take care of this.

424
00:27:00,325 --> 00:27:02,076
All right, just keep it
still back there, lady,

425
00:27:02,077 --> 00:27:07,077
or else we're gonna have to,
you know, to shoot you.

426
00:27:13,505 --> 00:27:18,505
Hey, I'll take care of this.

427
00:27:39,155 --> 00:27:44,155
How can I help you, Officer?

428
00:27:51,042 --> 00:27:52,835
This is a new car, then, sir?

429
00:27:52,836 --> 00:27:56,964
It certainly is, Officer.
Still got that smell.

430
00:27:56,965 --> 00:27:59,466
You're required to
display temporary tags,

431
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:02,177
either in the plate area or taped
to the inside of the back window.

432
00:28:02,178 --> 00:28:03,303
Certainly.

433
00:28:03,304 --> 00:28:05,722
Can I see your license
and registration, please?

434
00:28:05,723 --> 00:28:10,060
Certainly.

435
00:28:10,061 --> 00:28:13,438
Yeah, I was gonna tape up those...
The tag.

436
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:17,776
You know, to be in full
compliance, but it must have...

437
00:28:17,777 --> 00:28:21,321
It must have slipped my mind.

438
00:28:21,322 --> 00:28:22,698
So maybe the best
thing to do would be

439
00:28:22,699 --> 00:28:26,660
to take care of that
right here in Brainerd.

440
00:28:26,661 --> 00:28:29,079
What's this, sir?

441
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,332
My license and registration.

442
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:36,545
Yeah, I want to be
in compliance.

443
00:28:36,546 --> 00:28:39,339
I was just thinking we could
take care of it right here,

444
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:44,340
in Brainerd.

445
00:28:46,598 --> 00:28:49,892
Put that back in
your pocket, please,

446
00:28:49,893 --> 00:28:54,893
and step out of the
car, please, sir.

447
00:29:16,461 --> 00:29:21,461
Shut the fuck up.

448
00:29:35,647 --> 00:29:38,649
Whoa.

449
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:42,694
Whoa, daddy.

450
00:29:42,695 --> 00:29:47,695
You'll take care of it.

451
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:53,080
You are smooth,
smooth, you know?

452
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:56,750
On, daddy.

453
00:29:56,751 --> 00:29:59,670
Just clear him off the road.

454
00:29:59,671 --> 00:30:00,171
Yeah.

455
00:31:54,827 --> 00:31:55,327
No!

456
00:33:52,445 --> 00:33:53,057
Oh, jeez.

457
00:33:59,577 --> 00:34:01,203
Hi. It's Marge.

458
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,582
Oh, my. Where?

459
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:08,126
Yeah?

460
00:34:08,127 --> 00:34:11,713
Oh, jeez.

461
00:34:11,714 --> 00:34:13,965
Okay. There in a jiff.

462
00:34:13,966 --> 00:34:18,966
Real good, then.

463
00:34:24,185 --> 00:34:26,978
You can sleep.
It's early yet.

464
00:34:26,979 --> 00:34:28,063
Got to go?

465
00:34:28,064 --> 00:34:30,106
Yeah.

466
00:34:30,107 --> 00:34:32,442
I'll fix you some eggs.

467
00:34:32,443 --> 00:34:34,736
It's okay, hon.
I gotta run.

468
00:34:34,737 --> 00:34:39,115
You got to eat
a breakfast, Marge.

469
00:34:39,116 --> 00:34:42,077
I'll fix you some eggs.

470
00:34:42,078 --> 00:34:44,329
Hon, you can sleep.

471
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:47,582
You gotta eat a breakfast.

472
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:52,963
I'll fix you some eggs.

473
00:34:52,964 --> 00:34:53,464
Norm.

474
00:35:01,013 --> 00:35:03,848
Thanks, hon.
Time to shove off.

475
00:35:03,849 --> 00:35:05,058
Love you, Margie.

476
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:10,059
Love you, hon.

477
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,552
Hon?

478
00:35:40,553 --> 00:35:41,636
Yeah?

479
00:35:41,637 --> 00:35:46,637
Prowler needs a jump.

480
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,702
Hiya, Lou.

481
00:36:05,703 --> 00:36:08,204
What you got there?

482
00:36:08,205 --> 00:36:11,291
Margie, thought you might
need a little warm-up.

483
00:36:11,292 --> 00:36:13,084
Thanks a bunch.

484
00:36:13,085 --> 00:36:14,461
So what's the deal now?

485
00:36:14,462 --> 00:36:15,754
Gary says triple homicide?

486
00:36:15,755 --> 00:36:17,130
Yeah, looks pretty bad.

487
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:19,174
Two of them are over here.

488
00:36:19,175 --> 00:36:20,800
Where is everybody?

489
00:36:20,801 --> 00:36:25,801
Well, it's cold, Margie.

490
00:36:25,848 --> 00:36:30,848
Watch your step, Margie.

491
00:36:37,693 --> 00:36:40,236
Jeez. So“.

492
00:36:40,237 --> 00:36:42,030
Jeez!

493
00:36:42,031 --> 00:36:45,075
Here's the second one!

494
00:36:45,076 --> 00:36:49,120
It's in the head
and the hand there.

495
00:36:49,121 --> 00:36:51,164
I guess that's
a defensive wound.

496
00:36:51,165 --> 00:36:53,583
Oh, yeah?

497
00:36:53,584 --> 00:36:55,919
Where's the state trooper?

498
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,881
Back there a good piece, in the
ditch next to his prowler.

499
00:36:59,882 --> 00:37:01,925
Okay.

500
00:37:01,926 --> 00:37:04,636
So we got a trooper
pulls someone over.

501
00:37:04,637 --> 00:37:06,179
We got a shooting.

502
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,639
These folks drive by.

503
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,350
There's a high-speed
pursuit, ends here,

504
00:37:10,351 --> 00:37:12,644
and then this
execution-type deal.

505
00:37:12,645 --> 00:37:15,230
Yeah.

506
00:37:15,231 --> 00:37:18,358
I'd be very surprised if our
suspect was from Brainerd.

507
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:21,111
Yeah.

508
00:37:21,112 --> 00:37:22,987
And I'll tell you what.

509
00:37:22,988 --> 00:37:27,988
From his footprint, he
looks like a big fella.

510
00:37:29,453 --> 00:37:32,247
You see something
down there, Chief?

511
00:37:32,248 --> 00:37:35,125
No. I just think
I'm gonna barf.

512
00:37:35,126 --> 00:37:37,293
Jeez.

513
00:37:37,294 --> 00:37:38,878
You okay, Margie?

514
00:37:38,879 --> 00:37:42,966
Yeah. I'm fine.

515
00:37:42,967 --> 00:37:47,387
It's just morning sickness.

516
00:37:47,388 --> 00:37:49,139
Well, that passed.

517
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,306
Yeah?

518
00:37:50,307 --> 00:37:52,600
Yeah. Now
I'm hungry again.

519
00:37:52,601 --> 00:37:54,686
You have breakfast yet, Margie?

520
00:37:54,687 --> 00:37:56,521
Oh, yeah.

521
00:37:56,522 --> 00:37:57,814
Norm made some eggs.

522
00:37:57,815 --> 00:37:59,858
Yeah?

523
00:37:59,859 --> 00:38:02,235
Well...

524
00:38:02,236 --> 00:38:04,738
What now, do you think?

525
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:09,701
Let's go take
a look at that trooper.

526
00:38:09,702 --> 00:38:11,327
There's different
footprints here, Lou.

527
00:38:11,328 --> 00:38:12,454
Yeah?

528
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:15,165
Yeah. This guy's
smaller than his buddy.

529
00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:17,208
Oh, yeah?

530
00:38:17,209 --> 00:38:19,002
For Pete's sake.

531
00:38:19,003 --> 00:38:20,837
How's it look, Marge?

532
00:38:20,838 --> 00:38:23,840
Well, he's got his gun
on his hip there,

533
00:38:23,841 --> 00:38:26,676
and he looks like
a nice enough guy.

534
00:38:26,677 --> 00:38:28,553
It's a real shame.

535
00:38:28,554 --> 00:38:29,054
Yeah.

536
00:38:32,641 --> 00:38:34,476
Didn't monkey with his
car there, did you?

537
00:38:34,477 --> 00:38:35,643
No way.

538
00:38:35,644 --> 00:38:37,353
Well, somebody shut his lights.

539
00:38:37,354 --> 00:38:38,855
I guess the little guy
sat in there

540
00:38:38,856 --> 00:38:40,273
waiting for his
buddy to come back.

541
00:38:40,274 --> 00:38:41,941
Yeah, it would have
been cold out here.

542
00:38:41,942 --> 00:38:44,944
Heck, yeah. You think
is Dave open yet?

543
00:38:44,945 --> 00:38:46,946
Dave?

544
00:38:46,947 --> 00:38:48,698
You don't think
he's mixed up in...

545
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:53,699
Oh, no, no. I just want to get
Norm some night crawlers.

546
00:38:54,705 --> 00:38:56,831
Did you look
in his citation book?

547
00:38:56,832 --> 00:39:01,832
Yeah. Last vehicle he wrote in
was a tan Cierra at 2:18 a.m.

548
00:39:02,129 --> 00:39:04,422
Under plate
number he put "DLR."

549
00:39:04,423 --> 00:39:06,174
I figure they stopped him
or shot him

550
00:39:06,175 --> 00:39:09,302
before he could finish
filling out the tag number.

551
00:39:09,303 --> 00:39:12,889
So, I got the State looking for a
Cierra with a tag starting "DLR."

552
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:15,975
They don't got no match yet.

553
00:39:15,976 --> 00:39:18,102
I'm not sure that
I agree with you 100%

554
00:39:18,103 --> 00:39:20,230
on your police work there, Lou.

555
00:39:20,231 --> 00:39:22,148
Yeah?
Yeah.

556
00:39:22,149 --> 00:39:26,069
I think that vehicle there
probably had dealer plates.

557
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:29,572
"DLR."

558
00:39:29,573 --> 00:39:32,575
Oh.

559
00:39:32,576 --> 00:39:35,286
Jeez.

560
00:39:35,287 --> 00:39:36,788
Say, Lou,

561
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:37,956
did you hear
the one about the guy

562
00:39:37,957 --> 00:39:39,582
who couldn't afford
personalized plates,

563
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:44,003
so he went and changed
his name to J3L-2404?

564
00:39:44,004 --> 00:39:49,004
Yeah. That's a good one.

565
00:39:53,264 --> 00:39:57,225
Look, all's I know is, you got a
problem, you call a professional.

566
00:39:57,226 --> 00:39:59,102
No. They said no cops.

567
00:39:59,103 --> 00:40:00,937
They were darn
clear on that, Wade.

568
00:40:00,938 --> 00:40:02,981
They said, "You call your cops,
and we're gonna shoot..."

569
00:40:02,982 --> 00:40:04,482
Of course they're
gonna say that.

570
00:40:04,483 --> 00:40:06,609
Where's my protection?
They got Jean here.

571
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,611
If I give these sons
of bitches $1 million,

572
00:40:08,612 --> 00:40:10,488
where's my guarantee
they're gonna let her go?

573
00:40:10,489 --> 00:40:11,573
Well, they...

574
00:40:11,574 --> 00:40:12,740
$1 million is a lot
of damn money.

575
00:40:12,741 --> 00:40:14,534
Yeah, but... There they are.
They got my daughter.

576
00:40:14,535 --> 00:40:16,119
Think this thing
through here, Wade.

577
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,122
You give them what they want,
why won't they let her go?

578
00:40:19,123 --> 00:40:22,083
You got to listen to
me on this one, Wade.

579
00:40:22,084 --> 00:40:23,960
Heck, you don't know.

580
00:40:23,961 --> 00:40:26,045
You're just whistling
Dixie here.

581
00:40:26,046 --> 00:40:28,131
I'm saying the cops, they
can advise us on this.

582
00:40:28,132 --> 00:40:29,465
I'm saying call a professional.

583
00:40:29,466 --> 00:40:32,468
No. No cops.

584
00:40:32,469 --> 00:40:35,013
That's final. This is
my deal here, Wade.

585
00:40:35,014 --> 00:40:36,139
Yeah.

586
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,182
Jean is my wife here.

587
00:40:38,183 --> 00:40:41,144
I gotta tell you, Wade, I'm leaning
to Jerry's viewpoint here.

588
00:40:41,145 --> 00:40:42,228
Well...

589
00:40:42,229 --> 00:40:44,480
We got to protect Jean. These“.

590
00:40:44,481 --> 00:40:46,316
We're not holding
any cards here, Wade.

591
00:40:46,317 --> 00:40:48,359
They got them all.
So they call the shots.

592
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,569
You're darn tooting.

593
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:50,737
Oh, damn it.

594
00:40:50,738 --> 00:40:51,988
I'm telling you.

595
00:40:51,989 --> 00:40:55,158
Well, why don't we...

596
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:58,119
Stan, I'm thinking we should
offer them a half a million.

597
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,621
Now, come on here!

598
00:40:59,622 --> 00:41:01,664
No way, Wade.
No way.

599
00:41:01,665 --> 00:41:03,124
We're not horse-trading
here, Wade.

600
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:04,208
Yeah.

601
00:41:04,209 --> 00:41:06,002
We gotta just bite the
bullet on this thing.

602
00:41:06,003 --> 00:41:09,005
Yeah.

603
00:41:09,006 --> 00:41:11,883
So, well, what's the
next step here, Jerry?

604
00:41:11,884 --> 00:41:14,594
They're gonna call me up and
give me instructions for a drop.

605
00:41:14,595 --> 00:41:16,262
I'm supposed to have the
money ready tomorrow.

606
00:41:16,263 --> 00:41:20,183
Damn it!

607
00:41:20,184 --> 00:41:21,809
How was everything today?

608
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:25,438
Yeah. Real good, now.

609
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:27,482
How you doing?

610
00:41:27,483 --> 00:41:30,985
Okay. Now, we'll get
the money together.

611
00:41:30,986 --> 00:41:33,154
Don't worry about it, Jerry.

612
00:41:33,155 --> 00:41:37,158
Now, do you want anyone at
home with you till they call?

613
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:38,701
No, I...
They don't...

614
00:41:38,702 --> 00:41:40,578
They were just supposed
to be dealing with me.

615
00:41:40,579 --> 00:41:41,871
They were real clear.
Yeah.

616
00:41:41,872 --> 00:41:44,123
You know, they said
no one listening in.

617
00:41:44,124 --> 00:41:45,375
They'll be watching.

618
00:41:45,376 --> 00:41:47,418
You know, maybe it's all bull,

619
00:41:47,419 --> 00:41:50,046
but like you said, Stan,
they're calling the shots.

620
00:41:50,047 --> 00:41:51,714
Okay.

621
00:41:51,715 --> 00:41:56,177
Now, is Scotty
gonna be all right?

622
00:41:56,178 --> 00:41:58,596
Yeah. Jeez. Scotty.

623
00:41:58,597 --> 00:42:00,515
Yeah. I'll go
talk to him.

624
00:42:16,156 --> 00:42:18,700
How you doing there, Scotty?

625
00:42:18,701 --> 00:42:20,785
Dad...

626
00:42:20,786 --> 00:42:23,496
What are they doing?

627
00:42:23,497 --> 00:42:25,206
What do you think
they're doing with Mom?

628
00:42:25,207 --> 00:42:27,000
It's okay, Scotty.

629
00:42:27,001 --> 00:42:28,751
They're not gonna
wanna hurt her any.

630
00:42:28,752 --> 00:42:32,088
These men,
they just want money.

631
00:42:32,089 --> 00:42:34,340
Yeah, well, what if
something goes wrong, Dad?

632
00:42:34,341 --> 00:42:38,011
No, no. Nothing's
going wrong here.

633
00:42:38,012 --> 00:42:43,012
Granddad and I, we're, we're making
sure this gets handled right.

634
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,393
I really think we should
call the cops here.

635
00:42:45,394 --> 00:42:49,105
No. No. No one can
know about this thing.

636
00:42:49,106 --> 00:42:51,107
We gotta play
ball with these guys.

637
00:42:51,108 --> 00:42:53,276
You ask Stan Grossman, he'll
tell you the same thing.

638
00:42:53,277 --> 00:42:54,360
Yeah. But, Dad...

639
00:42:54,361 --> 00:42:58,114
We're gonna get Mom back for
you, but we gotta play ball.

640
00:42:58,115 --> 00:43:00,908
You know?

641
00:43:00,909 --> 00:43:05,909
That's the deal here.

642
00:43:06,915 --> 00:43:09,792
So if Lorraine calls,
or Sylvia,

643
00:43:09,793 --> 00:43:14,793
you just say Mom's down in
Florida, with Pearl and Marty.

644
00:43:17,342 --> 00:43:22,342
That's the best we can do here.

645
00:44:03,347 --> 00:44:05,765
No!

646
00:44:21,824 --> 00:44:22,324
No!

647
00:44:28,247 --> 00:44:28,791
Oh, God.

648
00:44:46,056 --> 00:44:47,223
Lunchtime.

649
00:44:47,224 --> 00:44:48,516
Thanks, Margaret.

650
00:44:48,517 --> 00:44:50,768
Hi. Hey.

651
00:44:50,769 --> 00:44:53,062
Willy. Carol.

652
00:44:53,063 --> 00:44:55,106
Janie, two more of those
Skin So Soft, please.

653
00:44:55,107 --> 00:44:57,608
Sure thing.

654
00:44:57,609 --> 00:44:59,152
Hiya, hon.

655
00:44:59,153 --> 00:45:02,071
I brought you
some lunch, Margie.

656
00:45:02,072 --> 00:45:03,281
What are those?
Night crawlers?

657
00:45:03,282 --> 00:45:04,490
Yeah.

658
00:45:04,491 --> 00:45:05,825
Oh, thanks, hon.

659
00:45:05,826 --> 00:45:07,952
You bet.
Thanks for lunch.

660
00:45:07,953 --> 00:45:10,204
Yeah.
Looks pretty good.

661
00:45:10,205 --> 00:45:13,166
What do we got here, Arby's?

662
00:45:13,167 --> 00:45:14,750
How's the painting going?

663
00:45:14,751 --> 00:45:17,086
Pretty good.

664
00:45:17,087 --> 00:45:19,755
Found out the Hautmans are
entering a painting this year.

665
00:45:19,756 --> 00:45:21,924
Hon, you're better than them.

666
00:45:21,925 --> 00:45:23,926
They're real good.

667
00:45:23,927 --> 00:45:27,972
They're good, Norm, but
you're better than them.

668
00:45:27,973 --> 00:45:31,058
You think so?

669
00:45:31,059 --> 00:45:33,811
Hey, you got Arby's
all over me.

670
00:45:35,731 --> 00:45:37,899
Hiya, Norm.
How's the painting going?

671
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,525
Not too bad.
You know.

672
00:45:39,526 --> 00:45:40,902
How we doing on that vehicle?

673
00:45:40,903 --> 00:45:43,613
Well, no motels registered
any tan Cierra last night,

674
00:45:43,614 --> 00:45:47,116
but the night before, two men
checked into the Blue Ox,

675
00:45:47,117 --> 00:45:50,328
registering a Cierra and
leaving the tag space blank.

676
00:45:50,329 --> 00:45:51,579
Jeez, that's a good lead.

677
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:52,747
Yeah.

678
00:45:52,748 --> 00:45:55,291
Blue Ox, that's that truckers'
joint out there on I-35?

679
00:45:55,292 --> 00:45:58,002
Yeah. Owner was
on the desk then.

680
00:45:58,003 --> 00:46:00,004
Said these two had company.

681
00:46:00,005 --> 00:46:01,255
Oh, yeah?

682
00:46:01,256 --> 00:46:01,756
Yeah.

683
00:46:06,303 --> 00:46:08,638
Yeah, we both did.
She went to college, too.

684
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,640
I went to Normandale for
about a year and a half.

685
00:46:10,641 --> 00:46:11,807
Yeah, that's where we met.

686
00:46:11,808 --> 00:46:12,975
But I dropped out, though.

687
00:46:12,976 --> 00:46:14,143
Yeah.
She dropped.

688
00:46:14,144 --> 00:46:15,478
Yeah.

689
00:46:15,479 --> 00:46:17,021
So where you girls from?

690
00:46:17,022 --> 00:46:18,981
Chaska.
Le Sueur.

691
00:46:18,982 --> 00:46:21,192
But I went to high school
in White Bear Lake.

692
00:46:21,193 --> 00:46:23,277
Go Bears.

693
00:46:23,278 --> 00:46:27,240
Okay. I want you to tell me
what these fellows looked like.

694
00:46:27,241 --> 00:46:29,200
Well, the little guy, he
was kind of funny-looking.

695
00:46:29,201 --> 00:46:30,326
In what way?

696
00:46:30,327 --> 00:46:32,328
I don't know.
Just funny-looking.

697
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:34,747
Can you be any more specific?

698
00:46:34,748 --> 00:46:36,165
I couldn't really say.

699
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:39,043
He wasn't circumcised.

700
00:46:39,044 --> 00:46:41,629
Was he funny-looking
apart from that?

701
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:44,006
Yeah.

702
00:46:44,007 --> 00:46:47,927
So, you were having sex
with the little fella, then.

703
00:46:47,928 --> 00:46:49,178
Uh-huh.

704
00:46:49,179 --> 00:46:51,305
Is there anything else
you can tell me about him?

705
00:46:51,306 --> 00:46:54,225
No. Like I say,
he was funny-looking.

706
00:46:54,226 --> 00:46:56,352
More than most people, even.

707
00:46:56,353 --> 00:46:57,645
What about the other fella?

708
00:46:57,646 --> 00:46:58,854
He was a little older.

709
00:46:58,855 --> 00:47:00,690
You know, he looked
like the Marlboro Man.

710
00:47:00,691 --> 00:47:02,441
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

711
00:47:02,442 --> 00:47:03,985
But maybe I'm saying
that, you know,

712
00:47:03,986 --> 00:47:06,362
'cause he smoked
a lot of Marlboros.

713
00:47:06,363 --> 00:47:08,281
You know, like a
subconscious type of thing.

714
00:47:08,282 --> 00:47:09,532
Oh, yeah, that can happen.

715
00:47:09,533 --> 00:47:10,658
Yeah.

716
00:47:10,659 --> 00:47:12,743
Hey, they said they were
going to the Twin Cities.

717
00:47:12,744 --> 00:47:14,328
Oh, yeah?
Yeah!

718
00:47:14,329 --> 00:47:15,871
Yeah, is that useful to you?

719
00:47:15,872 --> 00:47:17,540
You betcha. Yeah.

720
00:47:17,541 --> 00:47:21,043
Yeah.
Yeah.

721
00:47:21,044 --> 00:47:22,295
Come on!

722
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:26,924
Goddamn it!

723
00:47:26,925 --> 00:47:30,511
Jesus Christ.

724
00:47:30,512 --> 00:47:33,556
Fucking shitbox.

725
00:47:33,557 --> 00:47:36,642
Been here for days.

726
00:47:36,643 --> 00:47:39,770
Damn it.
Nothing to do.

727
00:47:39,771 --> 00:47:43,816
Fucking TV doesn't even...

728
00:47:43,817 --> 00:47:48,817
Damn it, come on! Plug me in, man.
Give me a fucking signal.

729
00:47:49,364 --> 00:47:53,576
Goddamn it!

730
00:47:53,577 --> 00:47:56,078
Unbelievable! Come on!

731
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:57,913
God...

732
00:47:57,914 --> 00:47:59,123
Fuck!

733
00:47:59,124 --> 00:48:04,003
Come on, plug me into
the ozone, baby! Come on!

734
00:48:04,004 --> 00:48:07,089
Come on!

735
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:09,925
Fuck! Fuck!

736
00:48:09,926 --> 00:48:14,926
Fuck! Fuck!

737
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:22,772
The bark beetle
carries the worm to its nest

738
00:48:22,773 --> 00:48:27,773
where it will feed its young
for up to six months.

739
00:48:28,653 --> 00:48:31,989
In the spring, the larvae hatch,
and the cycle begins again.

740
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:34,575
Well...

741
00:48:34,576 --> 00:48:36,952
I'm turning in, Norm.

742
00:48:36,953 --> 00:48:41,165
Oh, yeah?

743
00:48:41,166 --> 00:48:46,166
Here it is, throwing
off the larval envelope.

744
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,724
Hello?

745
00:48:58,725 --> 00:49:00,976
Yeah.
Is this Marge?

746
00:49:00,977 --> 00:49:02,144
Yeah.

747
00:49:02,145 --> 00:49:04,814
Margie Olmstead?

748
00:49:04,815 --> 00:49:07,066
Yeah. Who's this?

749
00:49:07,067 --> 00:49:09,360
This is Mike Yanagita!

750
00:49:09,361 --> 00:49:14,361
You know, Mike Yanagita.
Remember me?

751
00:49:14,408 --> 00:49:15,991
Mike Yanagita?

752
00:49:15,992 --> 00:49:17,993
Yeah!

753
00:49:17,994 --> 00:49:20,788
Well, yeah!

754
00:49:20,789 --> 00:49:22,498
Course I remember you.

755
00:49:22,499 --> 00:49:25,000
How are you doing?
What time is it?

756
00:49:25,001 --> 00:49:27,503
Oh, jeez.
It's 10:45.

757
00:49:27,504 --> 00:49:29,004
I hope I didn't wake you.

758
00:49:29,005 --> 00:49:31,841
No. That's okay.

759
00:49:31,842 --> 00:49:34,009
Yeah, I'm down in
the Twin Cities,

760
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:36,971
and I was just watching on TV about
these shootings up in Brainerd.

761
00:49:36,972 --> 00:49:38,514
And I saw you
on the news there.

762
00:49:38,515 --> 00:49:39,682
Yeah.

763
00:49:39,683 --> 00:49:41,308
I thought, "Jeez, is
that Margie Olmstead?"

764
00:49:41,309 --> 00:49:42,518
I can't believe it.

765
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:45,563
Yeah, that's me.

766
00:49:45,564 --> 00:49:47,356
Well, how the heck are you?

767
00:49:47,357 --> 00:49:49,859
Okay. You know.

768
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:50,943
Okay.

769
00:49:50,944 --> 00:49:53,028
Yeah?
Yeah.

770
00:49:53,029 --> 00:49:54,572
How you doing?

771
00:49:54,573 --> 00:49:57,199
Pretty good.

772
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,951
Well, heck.

773
00:49:58,952 --> 00:50:02,037
It's been such
a long time, Mike.

774
00:50:02,038 --> 00:50:07,038
It's great to hear from you.

775
00:50:07,502 --> 00:50:09,462
Yeah, you got your...

776
00:50:09,463 --> 00:50:12,590
This is loaded here. This
has your independent...

777
00:50:12,591 --> 00:50:16,051
Your front-wheel drive,
rack-and-pinion steering,

778
00:50:16,052 --> 00:50:19,430
antilock brakes, alarm, radar,

779
00:50:19,431 --> 00:50:22,099
and I can give it to you
with a heck of a sealant.

780
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,477
This TruCoat stuff,
it'll keep the salt off.

781
00:50:24,478 --> 00:50:26,395
Yeah, I don't need
no sealant, though.

782
00:50:26,396 --> 00:50:28,314
Yeah.
You don't need that.

783
00:50:28,315 --> 00:50:30,149
Now, were you thinking
of financing here?

784
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:32,860
You ought to be aware of this
GMAC plan they have now.

785
00:50:32,861 --> 00:50:33,944
It's really super.

786
00:50:33,945 --> 00:50:35,237
Got a call for you, Jerry.

787
00:50:35,238 --> 00:50:39,867
Yeah, okay.

788
00:50:43,538 --> 00:50:44,747
Jerry Lundegaard.

789
00:50:44,748 --> 00:50:46,999
All right, Jerry, you got
the phone to yourself?

790
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,167
Well, yeah.

791
00:50:48,168 --> 00:50:49,251
You know who this is?

792
00:50:49,252 --> 00:50:51,337
Well, yeah, l got an idea.

793
00:50:51,338 --> 00:50:53,255
How's that Cierra
working out for you?

794
00:50:53,256 --> 00:50:55,591
Circumstances
have changed, Jerry.

795
00:50:55,592 --> 00:50:57,593
Well...

796
00:50:57,594 --> 00:50:58,719
What do you mean?

797
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,515
Things have changed. Circumstances,
Jerry, beyond the acts of God.

798
00:51:02,516 --> 00:51:03,641
Force majeure.

799
00:51:03,642 --> 00:51:04,975
What the...

800
00:51:04,976 --> 00:51:07,770
How's Jean?

801
00:51:07,771 --> 00:51:08,896
Who's Jean?

802
00:51:08,897 --> 00:51:10,940
My wife. What the...

803
00:51:10,941 --> 00:51:13,067
She's all right, but there's
three people up in Brainerd

804
00:51:13,068 --> 00:51:14,360
who aren't so okay,
I'll tell you that.

805
00:51:14,361 --> 00:51:15,611
What the heck
are you talking about?

806
00:51:15,612 --> 00:51:17,279
Let's just finish
this deal up here.

807
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,241
Blood has been shed, Jerry.

808
00:51:20,242 --> 00:51:21,325
What the heck do you mean?

809
00:51:21,326 --> 00:51:23,285
Three people in Brainerd.

810
00:51:23,286 --> 00:51:24,453
Oh, jeez.

811
00:51:24,454 --> 00:51:26,580
That's right, and
we need more money.

812
00:51:26,581 --> 00:51:27,873
What the heck
are you talking about?

813
00:51:27,874 --> 00:51:29,875
What do you fellas
got yourself mixed up in?

814
00:51:29,876 --> 00:51:30,960
We need more money...

815
00:51:30,961 --> 00:51:33,128
This was supposed to be
a no-rough-stuff type deal.

816
00:51:33,129 --> 00:51:35,798
Don't ever interrupt me, Jerry!
Just shut the fuck up!

817
00:51:35,799 --> 00:51:38,008
Well, I'm sorry,
but I just, I...

818
00:51:38,009 --> 00:51:40,261
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
I'm not gonna debate!

819
00:51:40,262 --> 00:51:41,845
We now want the entire 80,000.

820
00:51:41,846 --> 00:51:43,806
Oh, for Christ's sake here.

821
00:51:43,807 --> 00:51:45,140
Blood has been shed.

822
00:51:45,141 --> 00:51:46,475
We've incurred risk, Jerry.

823
00:51:46,476 --> 00:51:47,685
I'm coming into town tomorrow.

824
00:51:47,686 --> 00:51:48,894
You have the money ready.

825
00:51:48,895 --> 00:51:51,355
Now, we had a deal here.
A deal's a deal.

826
00:51:51,356 --> 00:51:52,481
Is it, Jerry?

827
00:51:52,482 --> 00:51:54,775
You ask those three poor souls up
in Brainerd if a deal's a deal.

828
00:51:54,776 --> 00:51:55,985
Go ahead, ask them!

829
00:51:55,986 --> 00:51:57,111
The heck do you mean?

830
00:51:57,112 --> 00:52:01,699
"The heck do you mean?"
I'll see you tomorrow.

831
00:52:03,785 --> 00:52:04,827
Yeah?

832
00:52:04,828 --> 00:52:05,995
Jerome Lundegaard?

833
00:52:05,996 --> 00:52:07,121
Yeah.

834
00:52:07,122 --> 00:52:08,831
This is Reilly Diefenbach
at GMAC.

835
00:52:08,832 --> 00:52:11,667
Sir, I've not received those
vehicle IDs you promised.

836
00:52:11,668 --> 00:52:13,460
Yeah. I...

837
00:52:13,461 --> 00:52:14,795
Those are in the mail.

838
00:52:14,796 --> 00:52:17,631
That very well may be. I
must inform you, however,

839
00:52:17,632 --> 00:52:20,509
that absent the receipt of those
numbers by tomorrow afternoon,

840
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:23,095
I will have to refer this
matter to our legal department.

841
00:52:23,096 --> 00:52:24,179
Yeah.

842
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,015
My patience is at an end.
Yeah.

843
00:52:26,016 --> 00:52:31,016
Good day, sir.
Yeah.

844
00:53:26,409 --> 00:53:29,578
Hi, Norm.
How you doing, Margie?

845
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:31,038
How's the fricassee?

846
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:32,581
Pretty darn good.
You want some?

847
00:53:32,582 --> 00:53:33,916
Oh, no. I got...

848
00:53:33,917 --> 00:53:38,545
Hey, Norm, l thought you was going
ice fishing up at Mille Lacs.

849
00:53:38,546 --> 00:53:40,714
Yeah. After lunch.

850
00:53:40,715 --> 00:53:42,091
What you got there?

851
00:53:42,092 --> 00:53:44,593
The numbers you asked for.

852
00:53:44,594 --> 00:53:47,388
Calls made from the lobby
pay phone at the Blue Ox.

853
00:53:47,389 --> 00:53:49,515
Two to Minneapolis that night.

854
00:53:49,516 --> 00:53:50,933
First one's a trucking company

855
00:53:50,934 --> 00:53:52,893
and second one's
a private residence,

856
00:53:52,894 --> 00:53:55,646
a Shep Proudfoot.

857
00:53:55,647 --> 00:53:56,980
A what?

858
00:53:56,981 --> 00:53:59,983
Shep Proudfoot.
That's a name.

859
00:53:59,984 --> 00:54:02,319
Yeah.

860
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:05,072
Okay. Yeah.

861
00:54:05,073 --> 00:54:06,990
Think I'll take a drive
down there, then.

862
00:54:06,991 --> 00:54:11,704
Oh, yeah?
Twin Cities.

863
00:54:11,705 --> 00:54:12,317
Oh, yeah?

864
00:54:27,137 --> 00:54:30,139
Damn it, I want to be
a part of this thing.

865
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:32,433
No. Wade,
they were real clear.

866
00:54:32,434 --> 00:54:34,351
They said they'd call
tomorrow with instructions,

867
00:54:34,352 --> 00:54:36,311
and it's gotta be
delivered by me alone.

868
00:54:36,312 --> 00:54:39,106
It's my money, I'll deliver it.

869
00:54:39,107 --> 00:54:40,482
What do they care?

870
00:54:40,483 --> 00:54:41,817
Wade's got a point, there.

871
00:54:41,818 --> 00:54:43,402
I'll handle the call
if you want, Jerry.

872
00:54:43,403 --> 00:54:44,737
No, no. See, they...

873
00:54:44,738 --> 00:54:47,072
No. See, they only
deal with me.

874
00:54:47,073 --> 00:54:50,909
You feel this nervousness
on the phone there.

875
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:53,662
They're very... These
guys are dangerous.

876
00:54:53,663 --> 00:54:56,290
All the more reason.
I don't want you...

877
00:54:56,291 --> 00:54:59,209
With all due respect, Jerry, I
don't want you mucking this up.

878
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:00,335
What the heck do you mean?

879
00:55:00,336 --> 00:55:01,962
They want my money,
they can deal with me.

880
00:55:01,963 --> 00:55:03,505
Otherwise, I'm going
to a professional.

881
00:55:03,506 --> 00:55:05,257
No, see“.
There's $1 million here.

882
00:55:05,258 --> 00:55:06,383
No. See...

883
00:55:06,384 --> 00:55:09,303
Look, Jerry, you're not
selling me a damn car!

884
00:55:09,304 --> 00:55:13,348
It's my show here.
That's that!

885
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:18,349
It's the way we'd prefer
to handle it, Jerry.

886
00:55:22,358 --> 00:55:24,485
Hi. How you doing?

887
00:55:24,486 --> 00:55:26,236
Real good. How are you
doing today, ma'am?

888
00:55:26,237 --> 00:55:28,614
I'm doing really
super there. Thanks.

889
00:55:28,615 --> 00:55:32,618
I'm Mrs. Gunderson.
I have a reservation.

890
00:55:32,619 --> 00:55:35,579
Yep. You sure do,
Mrs. Gunderson.

891
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:40,083
Is there a phone
down here, you think?

892
00:55:40,084 --> 00:55:41,877
Detective Sibert?

893
00:55:41,878 --> 00:55:46,173
Yeah, this is Marge Gunderson
from up Brainerd. We spoke.

894
00:55:46,174 --> 00:55:48,759
Yeah. Well, actually,
I'm in town here.

895
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,844
I had to do a few things
in the Twin Cities,

896
00:55:50,845 --> 00:55:52,513
so I thought
I'd check in with you

897
00:55:52,514 --> 00:55:56,725
about that USFI search
on Shep Proudfoot.

898
00:55:56,726 --> 00:55:58,894
Oh, yeah?

899
00:55:58,895 --> 00:56:02,189
Well, maybe I'll go visit
with him if I have....

900
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:05,067
No. I can find that.

901
00:56:05,068 --> 00:56:06,318
Yeah. Well,
thanks a bunch.

902
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:09,196
Say, say, would you
happen to know

903
00:56:09,197 --> 00:56:12,908
a good place for lunch
in the downtown area?

904
00:56:12,909 --> 00:56:15,410
The Radisson.

905
00:56:15,411 --> 00:56:20,411
Oh, yeah?
Is it reasonable?

906
00:57:34,616 --> 00:57:36,783
Hi. How you doing?

907
00:57:36,784 --> 00:57:39,661
Yeah. I decided
not to park here.

908
00:57:39,662 --> 00:57:41,997
Well, what do you mean? You
decided not to park here?

909
00:57:41,998 --> 00:57:44,917
Yeah, I just came in and I
decided not to park here, so...

910
00:57:44,918 --> 00:57:47,669
But...
Well, I'm sorry, sir...

911
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:50,839
Yeah, I decided
not to... I...

912
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,132
You know, I'm not...

913
00:57:52,133 --> 00:57:54,509
I decided not to take the
trip, as it turns out, so...

914
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:59,510
Well, I'm sorry, sir, we still
got to charge you the $4.

915
00:57:59,557 --> 00:58:01,016
I just pulled in here.

916
00:58:01,017 --> 00:58:02,392
I just fucking pulled in here.

917
00:58:02,393 --> 00:58:03,560
Well, but...

918
00:58:03,561 --> 00:58:06,146
See, there's a minimum
charge of $4.

919
00:58:06,147 --> 00:58:09,191
Long-term parking
charges by the day.

920
00:58:13,655 --> 00:58:16,865
I guess you think you're, you
know, like an authority figure.

921
00:58:16,866 --> 00:58:19,242
That stupid fucking
uniform, huh, buddy?

922
00:58:19,243 --> 00:58:20,786
King clip-on tie there.

923
00:58:20,787 --> 00:58:22,829
Big fucking man, huh?

924
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:25,165
You know, these are the
limits of your life, man.

925
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:26,625
Ruler of your
little fucking gate here.

926
00:58:26,626 --> 00:58:31,626
Here. There's your $4,
you pathetic piece of shit.

927
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:33,548
Where's Shep?

928
00:58:33,549 --> 00:58:35,342
Talking to a cop.

929
00:58:35,343 --> 00:58:36,843
Cop?

930
00:58:36,844 --> 00:58:41,223
Said she was a cop.

931
00:58:41,224 --> 00:58:44,142
So do you remember getting
a call Wednesday night?

932
00:58:44,143 --> 00:58:45,894
Nope.

933
00:58:45,895 --> 00:58:49,231
You do reside there
at 1425 Freemont Terrace?

934
00:58:49,232 --> 00:58:50,315
Yep.

935
00:58:50,316 --> 00:58:52,401
Anyone else residing there?

936
00:58:52,402 --> 00:58:53,568
No.

937
00:58:53,569 --> 00:58:57,614
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call
came in past 3:00 in the morning.

938
00:58:57,615 --> 00:59:02,244
It's just hard for me to believe
you don't remember anyone calling.

939
00:59:02,245 --> 00:59:04,621
Now, I know you've
had some problems.

940
00:59:04,622 --> 00:59:06,581
Struggling with the narcotics,

941
00:59:06,582 --> 00:59:10,210
some other entanglements,
currently on parole.

942
00:59:10,211 --> 00:59:11,253
So?

943
00:59:11,254 --> 00:59:12,754
Well, associating
with criminals,

944
00:59:12,755 --> 00:59:14,089
if you're the one
they talked to,

945
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:17,342
that right there would be a
violation of your parole.

946
00:59:17,343 --> 00:59:20,262
Would end you up
back in Stillwater.

947
00:59:20,263 --> 00:59:22,305
Now, I saw some rough
stuff on your priors,

948
00:59:22,306 --> 00:59:24,016
but nothing in the
nature of a homicide.

949
00:59:24,017 --> 00:59:29,017
I know you don't want to be an
accessory to something like that.

950
00:59:29,939 --> 00:59:31,189
So, you think
you might remember

951
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:36,190
who those folks
were who called you?

952
00:59:42,577 --> 00:59:43,910
Mr. Lundegaard?

953
00:59:43,911 --> 00:59:45,162
Yeah.

954
00:59:45,163 --> 00:59:47,122
Could I take just a minute
of your time here?

955
00:59:47,123 --> 00:59:49,541
What is it all about?

956
00:59:49,542 --> 00:59:50,792
Do you mind if I sit down?

957
00:59:50,793 --> 00:59:53,003
Carrying quite a load here.

958
00:59:53,004 --> 00:59:54,963
You're the owner here,
Mr. Lundegaard?

959
00:59:54,964 --> 00:59:57,424
No. I...
Executive Sales Manager.

960
00:59:57,425 --> 00:59:59,301
Well, you can help me.
My name's Marge Gunderson.

961
00:59:59,302 --> 01:00:01,553
My father-in-law,
he's the owner.

962
01:00:01,554 --> 01:00:02,804
Uh-huh.

963
01:00:02,805 --> 01:00:04,848
Well, I'm a police officer
from up Brainerd,

964
01:00:04,849 --> 01:00:06,683
investigating some malfeasance.

965
01:00:06,684 --> 01:00:09,269
And I was just wondering if
you'd had any new vehicles

966
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:13,565
stolen off the lot
in the past couple of weeks.

967
01:00:13,566 --> 01:00:18,566
Specifically
a tan Cutlass Cierra.

968
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:24,618
Mr. Lundegaard.

969
01:00:24,619 --> 01:00:26,661
Brainerd.

970
01:00:26,662 --> 01:00:28,038
Yeah, yeah.

971
01:00:28,039 --> 01:00:30,665
Home of Paul Bunyan,
Babe, the Blue Ox.

972
01:00:30,666 --> 01:00:35,666
Babe, the Blue Ox.

973
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:41,380
Yeah, you know, we got
that big statue up there.

974
01:00:42,011 --> 01:00:45,722
So, you haven't had any
vehicles go missing, then?

975
01:00:45,723 --> 01:00:48,183
Nope. No, ma'am.

976
01:00:48,184 --> 01:00:49,518
Okey-dokey.
Thanks a bunch.

977
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:54,519
I'll let you get back
to your paperwork, then.

978
01:01:06,702 --> 01:01:08,370
Service.
Yeah, get me Shep.

979
01:01:08,371 --> 01:01:09,704
He's not here right now.

980
01:01:09,705 --> 01:01:10,831
What the heck do you mean?

981
01:01:10,832 --> 01:01:12,415
He stepped out.

982
01:01:12,416 --> 01:01:14,000
Where'd he go? It's only...
I'll get you Artie.

983
01:01:14,001 --> 01:01:18,046
No. I don't need
a mechanic. I need a...

984
01:01:19,715 --> 01:01:23,718
Jeez. I gotta talk
to a friend of his,

985
01:01:23,719 --> 01:01:25,887
so...

986
01:01:25,888 --> 01:01:29,307
Have him...

987
01:01:29,308 --> 01:01:30,433
What?

988
01:01:30,434 --> 01:01:33,603
Oh, jeez.

989
01:01:52,331 --> 01:01:54,291
Mike?

990
01:01:54,292 --> 01:01:57,377
Marge?

991
01:01:57,378 --> 01:02:00,172
Jeez! Oh, you look great!

992
01:02:00,173 --> 01:02:02,507
Yeah. So do you.
Easy there. Easy...

993
01:02:02,508 --> 01:02:05,927
Easy there. Easy there.
You do, too.

994
01:02:05,928 --> 01:02:07,596
I'm expecting now.

995
01:02:07,597 --> 01:02:09,931
I see that.
That's great.

996
01:02:09,932 --> 01:02:11,391
What can I get you?

997
01:02:11,392 --> 01:02:13,310
Just a Diet Coke, please.

998
01:02:13,311 --> 01:02:15,645
Great.

999
01:02:15,646 --> 01:02:17,063
This is a nice place.

1000
01:02:17,064 --> 01:02:20,692
Yeah. You know, it's the
Radisson, so it's pretty good.

1001
01:02:20,693 --> 01:02:21,193
Yeah.

1002
01:02:26,157 --> 01:02:27,991
So...

1003
01:02:27,992 --> 01:02:29,492
You're living in Edina, then?

1004
01:02:29,493 --> 01:02:31,703
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
A couple of years now.

1005
01:02:31,704 --> 01:02:33,496
It's actually Eden Prairie.

1006
01:02:33,497 --> 01:02:35,457
That school district.

1007
01:02:35,458 --> 01:02:38,543
So, Chief Gunderson, then!

1008
01:02:38,544 --> 01:02:41,213
So, you went and married
Norm son-of-a-Gunderson.

1009
01:02:41,214 --> 01:02:42,964
Oh, yeah.
Long time ago.

1010
01:02:42,965 --> 01:02:44,925
Great, great.

1011
01:02:44,926 --> 01:02:47,886
So, what brings you down?

1012
01:02:47,887 --> 01:02:49,638
Are you down here
on that homicide,

1013
01:02:49,639 --> 01:02:51,973
if you're allowed, you
know, to discuss that?

1014
01:02:51,974 --> 01:02:53,350
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1015
01:02:53,351 --> 01:02:57,062
But there's not a heck
of a lot to discuss.

1016
01:02:57,063 --> 01:02:58,647
Okay.

1017
01:02:58,648 --> 01:03:00,023
Well, what about you, Mike?

1018
01:03:00,024 --> 01:03:01,358
Are you married?

1019
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:02,525
You got kids?

1020
01:03:02,526 --> 01:03:04,903
Yeah, yeah. Well...

1021
01:03:04,904 --> 01:03:07,656
I was married.
I was married to...

1022
01:03:07,657 --> 01:03:09,658
You mind if I sit over here?

1023
01:03:09,659 --> 01:03:11,785
I was married to Linda Cooksey.

1024
01:03:11,786 --> 01:03:16,786
No. Why don't you sit over there?
I prefer that.

1025
01:03:18,042 --> 01:03:18,542
Okay.

1026
01:03:22,088 --> 01:03:23,255
Sorry.

1027
01:03:23,256 --> 01:03:26,091
No, no. Just so I can see you.
Don't have to turn my neck.

1028
01:03:26,092 --> 01:03:29,552
Sure, sure. I understand.

1029
01:03:29,553 --> 01:03:30,887
I didn't mean to...

1030
01:03:30,888 --> 01:03:35,888
No, no. That's fine.

1031
01:03:36,352 --> 01:03:39,813
Yeah, sorry. Sorry.

1032
01:03:39,814 --> 01:03:42,440
So, I was married
to Linda Cooksey.

1033
01:03:42,441 --> 01:03:45,318
You remember Linda.
She was a year behind us.

1034
01:03:45,319 --> 01:03:46,861
Yeah. I think
I remember her.

1035
01:03:46,862 --> 01:03:49,698
Yeah! She...
Oh, yeah!

1036
01:03:49,699 --> 01:03:51,366
So, it didn't work out, huh?

1037
01:03:51,367 --> 01:03:55,036
And then I've been working for
Honeywell for a few years now.

1038
01:03:55,037 --> 01:03:56,288
Well, they're a good outfit.

1039
01:03:56,289 --> 01:04:00,083
Yeah, if you're an engineer,
yeah, you could do a lot worse.

1040
01:04:00,084 --> 01:04:01,876
But it's not...

1041
01:04:01,877 --> 01:04:04,129
It's nothing like
your achievement.

1042
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:07,215
Well, it sounds like
you're doing really super.

1043
01:04:07,216 --> 01:04:08,883
It's not that...

1044
01:04:08,884 --> 01:04:13,555
It's not that things
didn't work out. It's...

1045
01:04:13,556 --> 01:04:17,142
Linda had leukemia, you know.

1046
01:04:17,143 --> 01:04:19,352
She was...
She passed away.

1047
01:04:19,353 --> 01:04:23,189
No.

1048
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:24,399
It was tough.

1049
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,151
There you go.

1050
01:04:26,152 --> 01:04:29,195
It was long...

1051
01:04:29,196 --> 01:04:32,699
She fought real hard, Marge.

1052
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,826
You know...

1053
01:04:34,827 --> 01:04:39,372
So, what can you say?

1054
01:04:39,373 --> 01:04:41,750
Better times, huh?

1055
01:04:41,751 --> 01:04:45,754
Better times.

1056
01:04:45,755 --> 01:04:50,755
And then I saw you on the TV
and I remembered, you know?

1057
01:04:50,843 --> 01:04:52,594
I always liked you.

1058
01:04:52,595 --> 01:04:53,928
Well, I always liked you...

1059
01:04:53,929 --> 01:04:58,929
I always liked you so much.

1060
01:04:59,852 --> 01:05:02,729
So, Mike, should we get together
another time, you think?

1061
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:03,274
No! I...

1062
01:05:08,402 --> 01:05:10,111
I'm sorry. It's...

1063
01:05:10,112 --> 01:05:12,614
You know, I shouldn't
have done this.

1064
01:05:12,615 --> 01:05:14,741
I shouldn't have done this.
I shouldn't.

1065
01:05:14,742 --> 01:05:17,369
I thought we'd have
a really terrific time.

1066
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:18,828
It's okay, Mike.

1067
01:05:18,829 --> 01:05:21,456
You were such a super lady.

1068
01:05:21,457 --> 01:05:26,457
And then...
I've been so lonely.

1069
01:05:27,588 --> 01:05:32,588
It's okay, Mike.

1070
01:05:35,429 --> 01:05:40,141
Here's a song I dedicate to all
the ladies out here tonight.

1071
01:05:40,142 --> 01:05:42,435
Goes like this.

1072
01:05:42,436 --> 01:05:46,314
Let's find each other tonight

1073
01:05:46,315 --> 01:05:50,151
Everything will be all right

1074
01:05:50,152 --> 01:05:52,153
Don't hesitate now

1075
01:05:52,154 --> 01:05:53,947
Let's find each other tonight

1076
01:05:53,948 --> 01:05:55,907
So...

1077
01:05:55,908 --> 01:05:58,660
Are you from around here?

1078
01:05:58,661 --> 01:06:01,079
Just in town on business.

1079
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:04,916
Just in and out.

1080
01:06:04,917 --> 01:06:08,545
Just a little
of the old in-and-out.

1081
01:06:08,546 --> 01:06:11,256
What do you do?

1082
01:06:11,257 --> 01:06:11,757
L...

1083
01:06:16,345 --> 01:06:17,929
You been to the
Celebrity Room before?

1084
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:20,348
With other clients?

1085
01:06:20,349 --> 01:06:21,933
I don't think so.

1086
01:06:21,934 --> 01:06:23,476
It's nice.

1087
01:06:23,477 --> 01:06:26,104
Yeah, well,
depends on the artist.

1088
01:06:26,105 --> 01:06:29,858
You know, Jose Feliciano,
you got no complaints.

1089
01:06:29,859 --> 01:06:33,111
Waiter!

1090
01:06:33,112 --> 01:06:35,572
What is he, deaf?

1091
01:06:35,573 --> 01:06:37,907
So...

1092
01:06:37,908 --> 01:06:40,368
How long you work
for the escort service?

1093
01:06:40,369 --> 01:06:43,580
I don't know.
A few months.

1094
01:06:43,581 --> 01:06:47,167
Find that work
interesting, do you?

1095
01:06:47,168 --> 01:06:49,711
What are you talking about?

1096
01:06:49,712 --> 01:06:51,129
Right.

1097
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:52,547
Come on.

1098
01:06:52,548 --> 01:06:56,384
I'm hearing bells.
Come on.

1099
01:06:56,385 --> 01:06:59,012
All right.
Where were you?

1100
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:06,644
Shep, what the hell are you doing?
I'm banging that girl.

1101
01:07:06,645 --> 01:07:11,107
Fucking asshole. Get
the fuck out of here.

1102
01:07:11,108 --> 01:07:14,194
Put me back in Stillwater,
you little fucking shithead.

1103
01:07:14,195 --> 01:07:15,820
Get the fuck out of here.

1104
01:07:16,906 --> 01:07:18,907
Yo!
Cut that shit out, man.

1105
01:07:18,908 --> 01:07:21,993
Trying to get some
goddamn sleep here.

1106
01:07:21,994 --> 01:07:23,077
Come on, brother...

1107
01:07:23,078 --> 01:07:23,690
FUCK you!

1108
01:07:30,753 --> 01:07:32,253
Fuck you.

1109
01:07:32,254 --> 01:07:33,546
Animals!

1110
01:07:35,424 --> 01:07:37,133
Stay away from me, man.

1111
01:07:37,134 --> 01:07:39,302
Hey, smoke
a fucking peace pipe!

1112
01:07:39,303 --> 01:07:42,180
Don't you dare fucking hit me!

1113
01:07:48,604 --> 01:07:50,438
Fucking little weasel!

1114
01:07:50,439 --> 01:07:52,232
Fuck you, man.
Stop it!

1115
01:07:52,233 --> 01:07:56,110
You fucking, motherfucking,
son-of-a-bitching, fucking cock!

1116
01:07:56,111 --> 01:08:01,111
Jesus Christ! You fucking
shitbag motherfucker!

1117
01:08:03,744 --> 01:08:04,786
Yeah?

1118
01:08:04,787 --> 01:08:06,120
All right, Jerry, I'm
through fucking around.

1119
01:08:06,121 --> 01:08:07,288
You got the fucking money?

1120
01:08:07,289 --> 01:08:09,415
Yeah, I got the money, but...

1121
01:08:09,416 --> 01:08:11,167
Don't you fucking
but me, Jerry.

1122
01:08:11,168 --> 01:08:14,254
I want you to put this money in the
Dayton Radisson parking ramp, top level,

1123
01:08:14,255 --> 01:08:15,838
30 minutes, Jerry,
we wrap this thing up.

1124
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:16,965
Okay. But...

1125
01:08:16,966 --> 01:08:19,300
Hey, you're there in 30
minutes or I find you, Jerry,

1126
01:08:19,301 --> 01:08:20,885
and I shoot you and l
shoot your fucking wife,

1127
01:08:20,886 --> 01:08:22,262
and I shoot all your
little fucking children

1128
01:08:22,263 --> 01:08:24,806
and I shoot them all in the back of
their little fucking heads. You got it?

1129
01:08:24,807 --> 01:08:26,724
Okay, now, you stay away
from Scotty, now.

1130
01:08:26,725 --> 01:08:27,809
Got it?

1131
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:32,810
Okay. Real good, then.

1132
01:08:54,503 --> 01:08:56,337
SCOTTY'. Dad.

1133
01:08:56,338 --> 01:08:57,839
It's okay, Scotty.

1134
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,841
Where you going?

1135
01:08:59,842 --> 01:09:02,176
I'll be back in a minute.

1136
01:09:02,177 --> 01:09:07,177
If Stan calls, you just
tell him I went to Embers.

1137
01:09:08,851 --> 01:09:10,643
Okay.

1138
01:09:10,644 --> 01:09:13,354
Here's your damn money.

1139
01:09:13,355 --> 01:09:16,024
Now, where's my daughter?

1140
01:09:16,025 --> 01:09:17,525
Yeah.

1141
01:09:17,526 --> 01:09:22,526
You goddamn punk!

1142
01:09:36,754 --> 01:09:41,424
Who the fuck are you?

1143
01:09:41,425 --> 01:09:43,259
Who the fuck are you?

1144
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:47,263
I got your damn money.
Now, where's my daughter?

1145
01:09:47,264 --> 01:09:49,015
I am through fucking around!

1146
01:09:49,016 --> 01:09:50,767
Drop that fucking briefcase!

1147
01:09:50,768 --> 01:09:52,477
Where's my daughter?

1148
01:09:52,478 --> 01:09:54,896
Fuck you, man!
Where's Jerry?

1149
01:09:54,897 --> 01:09:57,273
I gave simple
fucking instructions.

1150
01:09:57,274 --> 01:09:59,067
Where's my damn daughter?

1151
01:09:59,068 --> 01:10:00,485
No Jean, no money.

1152
01:10:00,486 --> 01:10:02,445
Drop that fucking money!

1153
01:10:02,446 --> 01:10:05,907
No Jean, no money!

1154
01:10:05,908 --> 01:10:10,908
Is this a fucking joke here?

1155
01:10:14,416 --> 01:10:17,960
Oh, jeez.

1156
01:10:17,961 --> 01:10:20,129
You happy now, asshole?

1157
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:21,923
What's with you people?

1158
01:10:21,924 --> 01:10:26,924
You fucking imbeciles!

1159
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:36,600
You fucking shot me!

1160
01:11:50,846 --> 01:11:53,014
May I have your ticket, please?

1161
01:11:53,015 --> 01:11:58,015
Open the fucking gate!

1162
01:12:34,264 --> 01:12:34,876
Oh, jeez.

1163
01:13:05,963 --> 01:13:07,129
SCOTTY'. Dad'?

1164
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:08,714
Yeah?

1165
01:13:08,715 --> 01:13:10,842
Stan Grossman called.

1166
01:13:10,843 --> 01:13:12,218
Yeah. Okay.

1167
01:13:12,219 --> 01:13:13,344
Twice.

1168
01:13:13,345 --> 01:13:16,347
Okay.

1169
01:13:16,348 --> 01:13:18,432
Is everything okay?

1170
01:13:18,433 --> 01:13:21,310
Yeah.

1171
01:13:21,311 --> 01:13:25,231
Are you calling Stan?

1172
01:13:25,232 --> 01:13:28,401
Well, I'm...

1173
01:13:28,402 --> 01:13:33,402
I'm going to bed now.

1174
01:14:07,107 --> 01:14:08,316
How you doing?

1175
01:14:08,317 --> 01:14:10,318
Mr. Mohra?
Yeah?

1176
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:11,527
Officer Olson.

1177
01:14:11,528 --> 01:14:13,905
Yeah. Righto.

1178
01:14:13,906 --> 01:14:15,156
Well...

1179
01:14:15,157 --> 01:14:18,451
So I'm tending bar down there at
Ecklund and Swedlin's last Tuesday,

1180
01:14:18,452 --> 01:14:20,244
and this little guy's drinking,

1181
01:14:20,245 --> 01:14:22,330
and he says, "Where can
a guy find some action?

1182
01:14:22,331 --> 01:14:24,665
"I'm going crazy out
there at the lake."

1183
01:14:24,666 --> 01:14:26,250
And I says,
"What kind of action?"

1184
01:14:26,251 --> 01:14:28,502
And he says, "Woman action.
What do I look like?"

1185
01:14:28,503 --> 01:14:30,046
And I says, "Well,
what do I look like?

1186
01:14:30,047 --> 01:14:32,298
"I don't arrange
that kind of thing."

1187
01:14:32,299 --> 01:14:34,884
And he says, "But I'm going
crazy out there at the lake."

1188
01:14:34,885 --> 01:14:38,220
And I says, "Yeah, but this
ain't that kind of place."

1189
01:14:38,221 --> 01:14:41,807
He says, "Oh, so I get it. So you think
I'm some kind of jerk for asking."

1190
01:14:41,808 --> 01:14:43,434
Only he don't use
the word "jerk."

1191
01:14:43,435 --> 01:14:45,061
I understand.
Then he calls me a jerk,

1192
01:14:45,062 --> 01:14:47,605
says the last guy thought
he's a jerk is dead now.

1193
01:14:47,606 --> 01:14:49,273
So, I don't say nothing.

1194
01:14:49,274 --> 01:14:51,233
He says, "What do you
think about that?"

1195
01:14:51,234 --> 01:14:54,737
And I says, "Well, that don't sound
like too good a deal for him, then."

1196
01:14:54,738 --> 01:14:55,863
You got that right.

1197
01:14:55,864 --> 01:14:57,698
Yeah, he says, "Yeah,
that guy's dead,

1198
01:14:57,699 --> 01:14:59,283
"and I don't mean
of old age."

1199
01:14:59,284 --> 01:15:02,870
And then he says, "Jeez, I'm going
crazy out there at the lake."

1200
01:15:02,871 --> 01:15:03,996
White Bear Lake?

1201
01:15:03,997 --> 01:15:06,540
Yeah, well, at Ecklund and Swedlin,
that's closer to Moose Lake.

1202
01:15:06,541 --> 01:15:07,750
So I made that assumption.

1203
01:15:07,751 --> 01:15:08,834
Sure.

1204
01:15:08,835 --> 01:15:10,711
Anyway, he's drinking
at the bar,

1205
01:15:10,712 --> 01:15:12,505
so I don't think
a whole great deal of it,

1206
01:15:12,506 --> 01:15:15,591
but then Mrs. Mohra, she heard
about the homicides down here

1207
01:15:15,592 --> 01:15:20,592
and thought I should call
it in, so I called it in.

1208
01:15:22,015 --> 01:15:24,183
End of story.

1209
01:15:24,184 --> 01:15:25,726
Well, what'd this guy
look like, anyways?

1210
01:15:25,727 --> 01:15:27,395
Oh, he's a...

1211
01:15:27,396 --> 01:15:29,981
Little guy,
kind of funny-looking.

1212
01:15:29,982 --> 01:15:31,399
In what way?

1213
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,484
Just in a general kind of way.

1214
01:15:33,485 --> 01:15:36,153
Okay. Well, thanks a
bunch, Mr. Mohra.

1215
01:15:36,154 --> 01:15:37,905
You're right.
It's probably nothing,

1216
01:15:37,906 --> 01:15:39,198
but thanks for calling her in.

1217
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:40,533
Sure.

1218
01:15:40,534 --> 01:15:43,202
Looks like she's gonna
turn cold tomorrow.

1219
01:15:43,203 --> 01:15:45,663
Oh, yeah.
Got a front coming in.

1220
01:15:45,664 --> 01:15:50,664
Yeah.
You got that right.

1221
01:16:07,227 --> 01:16:12,227
Jesus Christ.

1222
01:18:25,323 --> 01:18:28,784
Valerie, I'm leaving this
morning, back up to Brainerd.

1223
01:18:28,785 --> 01:18:31,495
Well, I'm sorry
I won't see you.

1224
01:18:31,496 --> 01:18:32,788
But you think he's all right?

1225
01:18:32,789 --> 01:18:34,039
I saw him last night and...

1226
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:35,124
What did he say?

1227
01:18:35,125 --> 01:18:36,917
Well, it's nothing
specific he said.

1228
01:18:36,918 --> 01:18:40,212
It just seemed like it all hit
him really hard, his wife dying.

1229
01:18:40,213 --> 01:18:42,214
His wife?
Linda.

1230
01:18:42,215 --> 01:18:44,258
Who?
Linda Cooksey.

1231
01:18:44,259 --> 01:18:46,177
No. No, no.
They weren't...

1232
01:18:46,178 --> 01:18:49,180
He was bothering Linda for about...
For a good year.

1233
01:18:49,181 --> 01:18:52,600
Really pestering her,
wouldn't leave her alone.

1234
01:18:52,601 --> 01:18:54,435
So...

1235
01:18:54,436 --> 01:18:56,437
He didn't...

1236
01:18:56,438 --> 01:18:57,521
He never...

1237
01:18:57,522 --> 01:18:59,273
No! No,
they never married.

1238
01:18:59,274 --> 01:19:01,859
Mike's had
psychiatric problems.

1239
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:03,319
Oh, my-

1240
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:04,945
Yeah, he's been struggling.

1241
01:19:04,946 --> 01:19:08,449
He's living
with his parents now.

1242
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:09,867
Oh, jeez.

1243
01:19:09,868 --> 01:19:12,328
Linda's fine.
You should call her.

1244
01:19:12,329 --> 01:19:14,538
Jeez. Well...

1245
01:19:14,539 --> 01:19:17,374
Jeez.

1246
01:19:17,375 --> 01:19:22,375
That's a surprise.

1247
01:19:29,095 --> 01:19:29,595
Hello!

1248
01:20:11,221 --> 01:20:14,306
Mr. Lundegaard, sorry to bother you again.
Can I come in?

1249
01:20:14,307 --> 01:20:17,434
Yeah... No.
I'm kind of busy here.

1250
01:20:17,435 --> 01:20:20,020
I understand. I'll keep
it real short, then.

1251
01:20:20,021 --> 01:20:22,940
I'm on my way out of town,
but I was wondering...

1252
01:20:22,941 --> 01:20:24,191
Do you mind if I sit down?

1253
01:20:24,192 --> 01:20:25,442
Carrying a bit of a load here.

1254
01:20:25,443 --> 01:20:26,652
No, I...

1255
01:20:26,653 --> 01:20:28,445
Yeah, it's this vehicle
I asked about yesterday.

1256
01:20:28,446 --> 01:20:29,530
I was just wondering...

1257
01:20:29,531 --> 01:20:32,741
Yeah, like I told you, we haven't
had any vehicles go missing.

1258
01:20:32,742 --> 01:20:35,828
Okay. Are you sure?

1259
01:20:35,829 --> 01:20:38,330
'Cause I mean, how do you know?

1260
01:20:38,331 --> 01:20:40,040
Because, see, the crime
I'm investigating,

1261
01:20:40,041 --> 01:20:42,334
the perpetrators were driving
a car with dealer plates,

1262
01:20:42,335 --> 01:20:43,669
and they called
someone who works here,

1263
01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:45,379
so it'd be quite a
coincidence if they weren't,

1264
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:47,840
you know, connected.

1265
01:20:47,841 --> 01:20:49,383
Yeah, I see.

1266
01:20:49,384 --> 01:20:50,843
So, how do you...

1267
01:20:50,844 --> 01:20:53,053
Have you done any kind
of inventory recently?

1268
01:20:53,054 --> 01:20:54,763
The car's not
from our lot, ma'am.

1269
01:20:54,764 --> 01:20:56,932
But how do you know that for
sure without doing a...

1270
01:20:56,933 --> 01:20:58,767
Well, I would know.

1271
01:20:58,768 --> 01:21:00,561
I'm the Executive
Sales Manager.

1272
01:21:00,562 --> 01:21:02,354
Yeah, but I understand...

1273
01:21:02,355 --> 01:21:03,939
We run a pretty tight
ship here.

1274
01:21:03,940 --> 01:21:05,065
I know, but...

1275
01:21:05,066 --> 01:21:07,192
Well, how do
they establish that, sir?

1276
01:21:07,193 --> 01:21:08,694
I mean,
are the cars counted daily,

1277
01:21:08,695 --> 01:21:10,612
or what kind of a routine here?

1278
01:21:10,613 --> 01:21:15,613
Ma'am, I answered
your question.

1279
01:21:17,412 --> 01:21:18,537
I'm sorry, sir?

1280
01:21:18,538 --> 01:21:21,457
Ma'am, I answered
your question.

1281
01:21:21,458 --> 01:21:22,624
I answered the darn...

1282
01:21:22,625 --> 01:21:27,625
I'm cooperating here,
and there's no...

1283
01:21:29,591 --> 01:21:32,509
Sir, you have no call
to get snippy with me.

1284
01:21:32,510 --> 01:21:34,094
I'm just doing my job here.

1285
01:21:34,095 --> 01:21:36,930
I'm...

1286
01:21:36,931 --> 01:21:40,267
I'm not...
I'm not arguing here.

1287
01:21:40,268 --> 01:21:42,770
I'm cooperating,
and there's no...

1288
01:21:42,771 --> 01:21:47,771
We're doing all we can.

1289
01:21:51,571 --> 01:21:56,571
Sir, could I talk
to Mr. Gustafson?

1290
01:21:58,328 --> 01:22:03,082
Mr. Lundegaard.

1291
01:22:03,083 --> 01:22:06,585
Well, heck! If you wanna...
If you wanna play games here,

1292
01:22:06,586 --> 01:22:09,296
I'm working with you
on this thing here, but...

1293
01:22:09,297 --> 01:22:12,299
Okay! I'll do a damn lot count!

1294
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:13,467
Sir, right now?

1295
01:22:13,468 --> 01:22:15,761
Yeah! Right now.

1296
01:22:15,762 --> 01:22:18,180
You're darn tooting!

1297
01:22:18,181 --> 01:22:22,059
If it's so damned
important to you.

1298
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:23,811
Well, I'm sorry, sir.

1299
01:22:23,812 --> 01:22:28,812
What the Christ! Jeez!

1300
01:22:39,536 --> 01:22:44,536
Bob Elcorona, line two.

1301
01:23:10,817 --> 01:23:15,817
For Pete's sake.

1302
01:23:16,281 --> 01:23:18,282
For Pete's sake, he's
fleeing the interview.

1303
01:23:18,283 --> 01:23:21,743
He's fleeing the interview!

1304
01:23:21,744 --> 01:23:26,039
How do I get
an outside line here?

1305
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:30,544
All right.

1306
01:23:30,545 --> 01:23:34,798
Yeah.
Detective Sibert, please.

1307
01:23:34,799 --> 01:23:37,384
I told you it was over, and I
thought I made myself very clear.

1308
01:23:37,385 --> 01:23:40,220
Oh, you did. You made
yourself perfectly clear.

1309
01:23:40,221 --> 01:23:42,556
But something's come up.

1310
01:23:42,557 --> 01:23:43,974
What?

1311
01:23:43,975 --> 01:23:45,392
Well, it's something
kind of small,

1312
01:23:45,393 --> 01:23:47,728
but it might be a big problem.

1313
01:23:47,729 --> 01:23:50,814
I'm pregnant.

1314
01:23:50,815 --> 01:23:54,151
I'm pregnant.

1315
01:23:54,152 --> 01:23:56,778
I've had a doctor's test,
I've got the certificate,

1316
01:23:56,779 --> 01:24:01,779
and there's no doubt about it,
I'm gonna have your baby.

1317
01:24:02,994 --> 01:24:05,579
Now, look here.
I can explain this.

1318
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:09,917
See, Robin was...
ls a student of mine.

1319
01:24:09,918 --> 01:24:12,753
You should see the other guy.

1320
01:24:12,754 --> 01:24:14,713
No, no, no. It wasn't
anything like that.

1321
01:24:14,714 --> 01:24:15,923
You don't understand!

1322
01:24:15,924 --> 01:24:17,758
I read that letter
that she wrote.

1323
01:24:17,759 --> 01:24:19,426
I think I understand
all there is...

1324
01:24:19,427 --> 01:24:22,471
What happened to her?

1325
01:24:22,472 --> 01:24:25,224
She started shrieking,
you know.

1326
01:24:25,225 --> 01:24:27,100
Jeez.

1327
01:24:27,101 --> 01:24:29,645
Well, I got the money.

1328
01:24:29,646 --> 01:24:34,525
All of it, all 80 grand.

1329
01:24:34,526 --> 01:24:39,279
That's 40 for you, 40 for me.

1330
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:44,280
That's it, then.

1331
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:47,287
You can have my truck.

1332
01:24:47,288 --> 01:24:48,872
I'm taking the Cierra.

1333
01:24:48,873 --> 01:24:52,459
We split that.

1334
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:56,046
How the fuck do you split
a fucking car, you dummy?

1335
01:24:56,047 --> 01:24:58,298
With a fucking chain saw?

1336
01:24:58,299 --> 01:25:01,218
One of us pays
the other for half.

1337
01:25:01,219 --> 01:25:04,596
Hold on.
No fucking way.

1338
01:25:04,597 --> 01:25:07,516
Did you fucking notice this?

1339
01:25:07,517 --> 01:25:09,643
I got fucking shot!

1340
01:25:09,644 --> 01:25:11,979
I got fucking shot in the face!

1341
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:13,605
I went and got
the fucking money!

1342
01:25:13,606 --> 01:25:15,440
I got shot
fucking picking it up!

1343
01:25:15,441 --> 01:25:19,486
I've been up
for 36 fucking hours!

1344
01:25:19,487 --> 01:25:20,988
I'm taking that fucking car!

1345
01:25:20,989 --> 01:25:24,575
That fuck is mine,
you fucking asshole.

1346
01:25:24,576 --> 01:25:27,995
You know, I've been listening to
your fucking bullshit all week!

1347
01:25:27,996 --> 01:25:31,540
Are we square?

1348
01:25:31,541 --> 01:25:35,377
Are we square?

1349
01:25:35,378 --> 01:25:39,339
Yeah, you fucking mute!

1350
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:41,341
And if you see your friend,
Shep Proudfoot,

1351
01:25:41,342 --> 01:25:45,971
tell him I'm gonna
nail his fucking ass.

1352
01:25:45,972 --> 01:25:50,972
- I'll call you...
- Later.

1353
01:25:59,944 --> 01:26:03,196
His wife. This guy says she
was kidnapped last Wednesday.

1354
01:26:03,197 --> 01:26:04,698
The day of our homicides.

1355
01:26:04,699 --> 01:26:05,866
Yeah.

1356
01:26:05,867 --> 01:26:07,284
And this guy was who?

1357
01:26:07,285 --> 01:26:09,995
Lundegaard's father-in-law's
accountant.

1358
01:26:09,996 --> 01:26:11,705
Gustafson's accountant.

1359
01:26:11,706 --> 01:26:12,956
Yeah.

1360
01:26:12,957 --> 01:26:14,708
But we still
haven't found Gustafson?

1361
01:26:14,709 --> 01:26:16,501
Looking...

1362
01:26:16,502 --> 01:26:18,295
Sorry. Didn't copy, Lou.

1363
01:26:18,296 --> 01:26:19,963
Still missing.
We're looking.

1364
01:26:19,964 --> 01:26:22,174
Copy.
And Lundegaard, too?

1365
01:26:22,175 --> 01:26:24,676
Yeah.
Where are you, Margie?

1366
01:26:24,677 --> 01:26:25,886
I'm almost back.

1367
01:26:25,887 --> 01:26:27,554
I'm taking a drive
around Moose Lake.

1368
01:26:27,555 --> 01:26:29,848
Gary's loudmouth.

1369
01:26:29,849 --> 01:26:31,308
Yeah, the loudmouth.

1370
01:26:31,309 --> 01:26:32,976
So the whole state has it, huh?

1371
01:26:32,977 --> 01:26:34,895
Gustafson and Lundegaard?

1372
01:26:34,896 --> 01:26:36,229
Yeah.
It's over the wire.

1373
01:26:36,230 --> 01:26:37,731
It's everywhere.
They'll find them.

1374
01:26:37,732 --> 01:26:39,274
COPY-

1375
01:26:39,275 --> 01:26:40,525
Yeah, we got a lead on this...

1376
01:26:40,526 --> 01:26:41,943
There's the car!
There's the car!

1377
01:26:41,944 --> 01:26:43,070
Whose car?

1378
01:26:43,071 --> 01:26:46,990
My car! My car!
Tan Cierra! Tan Cierra!

1379
01:26:46,991 --> 01:26:51,991
Okay. Careful, Margie.
I'll send a couple cars.

1380
01:28:43,483 --> 01:28:43,983
Police!

1381
01:28:52,450 --> 01:28:54,326
Hands up!

1382
01:28:54,327 --> 01:28:54,827
Police!

1383
01:28:58,831 --> 01:28:59,331
Police!

1384
01:30:00,101 --> 01:30:05,101
So that was Mrs. Lundegaard
on the floor in there.

1385
01:30:08,442 --> 01:30:13,442
And I guess that was your
accomplice in the wood chipper.

1386
01:30:16,617 --> 01:30:21,617
And those three people
in Brainerd.

1387
01:30:24,458 --> 01:30:27,127
And for what?

1388
01:30:27,128 --> 01:30:32,128
For a little bit of money.

1389
01:30:34,677 --> 01:30:39,677
There's more to life than
a little money, you know?

1390
01:30:47,607 --> 01:30:52,607
Don't you know that?

1391
01:30:55,781 --> 01:30:58,700
And here you are.

1392
01:30:58,701 --> 01:31:00,994
And it's a beautiful day.

1393
01:31:10,004 --> 01:31:10,504
Well...

1394
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:29,060
I just don't understand it.

1395
01:32:08,521 --> 01:32:11,314
Mr. Anderson?

1396
01:32:11,315 --> 01:32:12,607
Who?

1397
01:32:12,608 --> 01:32:17,487
Mr. Anderson, is this your
burgundy '98 out here?

1398
01:32:17,488 --> 01:32:19,030
Just a sec.

1399
01:32:19,031 --> 01:32:20,824
Could you open
the door, please?

1400
01:32:20,825 --> 01:32:23,243
Yeah, yeah, just a sec.

1401
01:32:23,244 --> 01:32:28,244
Just a sec.

1402
01:32:32,169 --> 01:32:34,212
- Dale!
- My leg!

1403
01:32:34,213 --> 01:32:36,256
No!

1404
01:33:14,712 --> 01:33:17,964
They announced it.

1405
01:33:17,965 --> 01:33:19,466
They announced it?

1406
01:33:19,467 --> 01:33:21,092
Yeah.

1407
01:33:21,093 --> 01:33:23,136
So?

1408
01:33:23,137 --> 01:33:25,472
Three-cent stamp.

1409
01:33:25,473 --> 01:33:27,223
Your mallard?

1410
01:33:27,224 --> 01:33:29,142
Yeah.

1411
01:33:29,143 --> 01:33:31,061
That's terrific.

1412
01:33:31,062 --> 01:33:33,521
It's just
a three-cent.

1413
01:33:33,522 --> 01:33:34,731
It's terrific.

1414
01:33:34,732 --> 01:33:38,068
Hautman's blue-winged
teal got the 29-cent.

1415
01:33:38,069 --> 01:33:40,278
People don't much
use the three-cent.

1416
01:33:40,279 --> 01:33:44,032
Oh, for Pete's...
Of course they do.

1417
01:33:44,033 --> 01:33:45,617
Whenever they
raise the postage,

1418
01:33:45,618 --> 01:33:47,952
people need the little stamps.

1419
01:33:47,953 --> 01:33:49,412
Yeah?

1420
01:33:49,413 --> 01:33:52,499
When they're stuck with a
bunch of the old ones.

1421
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:54,501
Yeah.

1422
01:33:54,502 --> 01:33:57,337
I guess.

1423
01:33:57,338 --> 01:34:02,338
That's terrific. I'm
so proud of you, Norm.

1424
01:34:04,011 --> 01:34:07,011
Heck, Norm, you know,
we're doing pretty good.

1425
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:12,435
I love you, Margie.

1426
01:34:12,436 --> 01:34:14,753
I love you, Norm.

1427
01:34:17,274 --> 01:34:19,553
Two more months.

1428
01:34:22,446 --> 01:34:24,593
Two more months.
