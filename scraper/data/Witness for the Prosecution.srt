1
00:00:13,938 --> 00:00:16,669
Silence. Be upstanding in court.

2
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:20,346
All persons who have anything
to do before my lords,

3
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:25,492
the queen's justices of oyer and
terminer and general jail delivery

4
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:29,034
for the jurisdiction of the
Central Criminal Court

5
00:00:29,286 --> 00:00:33,735
draw near and give your attendance.
God save the queen.

6
00:02:03,214 --> 00:02:07,139
What a beautiful day. I've been hoping
for a bit of sun for our homecoming.

7
00:02:07,426 --> 00:02:13,308
It's worth having the fog just to appreciate
the sunshine. Is there a draught?

8
00:02:13,682 --> 00:02:18,449
- Shall I roll up the window?
- Roll up your mouth. You talk too much.

9
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:22,173
If I'd known how much you talked
I'd never have come out of my coma.

10
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:24,648
- This thing weighs a ton.
- Now, now.

11
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:30,310
We've been flat on our back for two
months, we'd better be careful.

12
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:45,629
Lovely, lovely. It must be perfectly lovely
to live and work in the Inns of Court.

13
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:48,411
How lucky you lawyers are.

14
00:02:49,593 --> 00:02:53,075
I almost married a lawyer. I was
in attendance for his appendectomy

15
00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:55,953
and we became engaged as
soon as he could sit up.

16
00:02:56,183 --> 00:02:59,107
And then peritonitis set
in and he went like that.

17
00:02:59,353 --> 00:03:02,323
He certainly was a lucky lawyer.

18
00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:18,047
Teeny-weeny steps, now. Remember
we had a teeny-weeny heart attack.

19
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,378
Oh, shut up!

20
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,551
Williams, my cane.

21
00:03:28,883 --> 00:03:30,851
Here he comes!

22
00:03:42,146 --> 00:03:46,037
Good afternoon. Thank you very
much. Everybody back to work.

23
00:03:46,317 --> 00:03:50,322
Sir Wilfrid, if you don't mind, I'd like
to read you a poem to welcome you back.

24
00:03:50,613 --> 00:03:54,618
Very touching. You can recite it
after office hours in your own time.

25
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:57,276
Now back to work.
What's the matter with you?

26
00:03:57,495 --> 00:04:00,544
Nothing. I'm just happy that
you're your old self again.

27
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:04,839
Any more sentimentality around here,
I shall go back to the hospital!

28
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:08,574
They won't take him back. He wasn't
really discharged, you know,

29
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:12,082
he was expelled for conduct
unbecoming a cardiac patient.

30
00:04:12,343 --> 00:04:16,792
Put these in water, blabbermouth!
Come on in, Carter.

31
00:04:22,353 --> 00:04:26,677
Look at this room.
It's ugly, old and musty.

32
00:04:26,982 --> 00:04:30,748
But I never knew I could
miss anything so much.

33
00:04:31,028 --> 00:04:34,191
- Missed you too, you musty old buzzard.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

34
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:38,817
I'm not a religious man, but when they
carted you off, I went out and lit a candle.

35
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:42,760
- Why, thank you, Carter.
- Actually, sir, I was lighting it for myself.

36
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,726
If anything happened to you, what
would happen to me, after 37 years?

37
00:04:47,002 --> 00:04:49,972
37 years!
Has it been all that long?

38
00:04:50,214 --> 00:04:55,015
Yes, sir. This is 1952, that was in October
1915. The Shepherd's Bush murder.

39
00:04:55,344 --> 00:05:00,066
The chemist accused of putting
cyanide in his uncle's toothpaste.

40
00:05:00,391 --> 00:05:05,192
My first murder trial. I was more
frightened than the defendant.

41
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:10,163
First time I rose to make an objection,
my wig fell off. Where's my wig?

42
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:12,452
Right here.

43
00:05:13,821 --> 00:05:17,462
- I've guarded it with me life.
- I hope it still fits.

44
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:20,506
I lost 30lbs in that
wretched hospital.

45
00:05:20,744 --> 00:05:24,305
Still, I suppose my
head isn't any smaller.

46
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:31,505
What's all this?

47
00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:36,117
- We've put it in mothballs.
- Mothballs? Am I not to practise again?

48
00:05:36,427 --> 00:05:39,749
Of course. The solicitors have
been breaking down our doors.

49
00:05:40,014 --> 00:05:43,621
- I've got some interesting briefs for you.
- That's better.

50
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:48,342
Divorce case, a tax appeal, and an
important marine insurance claim.

51
00:05:48,647 --> 00:05:51,856
- Nice smooth matters with excellent fees.
- No, Carter.

52
00:05:52,109 --> 00:05:56,273
I'm sorry, but you're not to undertake
any criminal cases. Your doctors have...

53
00:05:56,572 --> 00:06:00,941
Doctors! They've deprived me of
alcohol, tobacco, female companionship.

54
00:06:01,243 --> 00:06:03,769
If only they'd let me do
something worthwhile!

55
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:04,997
Sorry, sir.

56
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:08,691
Might as well get a bigger box,
more mothballs, put me away too.

57
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,600
- 2:30, Sir Wilfrid. Time for our little nap!
- Oh, get out!

58
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,010
Beddy-bye. We'd better go upstairs
now, get undressed and lie down.

59
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:20,908
- We? What a nauseating prospect.
- Upstairs, please.

60
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,626
Are you aware that,
while on my sickbed,

61
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:29,060
I seriously considered strangling you
with one of your own rubber tubes.

62
00:06:29,396 --> 00:06:35,119
I would then have admitted the crime,
retained myself for the defence.

63
00:06:35,486 --> 00:06:41,414
My lord, members of the jury, I hereby
enter a plea of justifiable homicide.

64
00:06:41,784 --> 00:06:46,631
For four months this alleged angel
of mercy has pored, probed,

65
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:50,927
punctured, pillaged and
plundered my helpless body

66
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:55,181
while tormenting my mind with
a steady drip of baby talk.

67
00:06:55,464 --> 00:06:58,035
Come along now,
like a good boy. Oh, no.

68
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,944
Take your hands off me,
or I'll strike you with my cane.

69
00:07:01,178 --> 00:07:04,466
- You wouldn't, it might break your cigars.
- What cigars?

70
00:07:04,723 --> 00:07:08,011
- The ones you're smuggling in your cane.
- Cane?

71
00:07:15,151 --> 00:07:18,234
You could be jailed for this.
You had no search warrant.

72
00:07:18,487 --> 00:07:21,650
In hospital he'd hide cigars
and brandy all over the place.

73
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:24,592
We called him Wilfrid the fox.

74
00:07:24,827 --> 00:07:28,877
- I'm confiscating these.
- Can't I have just one?

75
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:31,452
No. Upstairs.

76
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:35,433
A few puffs after meals? Please.

77
00:07:36,881 --> 00:07:40,806
I'll do it. Some dark night when her back
is turned, I'll snatch her thermometer

78
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:44,859
and plunge it between her shoulder
blades. So help me, I will.

79
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:51,340
Oh, no, sir. You mustn't walk up. We've
installed something for you here. It's a lift.

80
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:55,450
A lift? I'm sick of this plot
to make me a helpless invalid.

81
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:59,658
I think it's a splendid idea.
Let's try it, shall we?

82
00:07:59,945 --> 00:08:04,553
Out of there. I'll try it. It's my
lift because it was my heart attack.

83
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:08,553
Here you are. Simply press this
button for up and this one for down.

84
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:11,799
Carter, I warn you, if this
contraption should collapse,

85
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:16,171
if the barrister should
fall off the bannister...

86
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:26,332
Remarkable. Smoothest
flight I've had in years.

87
00:08:26,555 --> 00:08:31,277
- Upsy-daisy!
- Once more to get the feel of the controls.

88
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:48,062
Good afternoon. Is it
possible to see Sir Wilfrid?

89
00:08:48,285 --> 00:08:50,970
I didn't make an appointment,
but this is urgent.

90
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:55,767
If it's about a brief, I'm sorry, but we're
full. Sir Wilfrid has all that he can handle.

91
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:58,167
I'm sure he'll want this brief.

92
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:00,859
Serious criminal matter.

93
00:09:03,092 --> 00:09:06,301
Absolutely not, Mr Mayhew.
Sir Wilfrid is still convalescent.

94
00:09:06,554 --> 00:09:09,524
He can't accept anything of
an overstimulating nature.

95
00:09:09,765 --> 00:09:12,848
Put me on a diet of bland
civil suits. Hello, Mayhew.

96
00:09:13,102 --> 00:09:15,582
Hello. Distressing news
about your health.

97
00:09:15,813 --> 00:09:19,340
It's tragic. You'd better get
a man with younger arteries.

98
00:09:19,608 --> 00:09:23,329
If you could just give us a few minutes.
This is Mr Leonard Vole.

99
00:09:23,612 --> 00:09:28,857
- He's in rather a ghastly mess, I'm afraid.
- How do you do, Mr Vole?

100
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:32,171
Well, according to Mr Mayhew,
I'm not doing at all well.

101
00:09:32,413 --> 00:09:35,019
Sir Wilfrid! Sir Wilfrid!

102
00:09:35,249 --> 00:09:38,332
- You're dawdling again!
- Oh, shut up!

103
00:09:38,586 --> 00:09:42,591
Sorry, Mayhew. Try me again when
you've something not too stimulating.

104
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,852
Like a postman bitten
by a stray dog.

105
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:56,977
I wish you could help us, Wilfrid, but I
quite understand. Take care of yourself.

106
00:09:58,272 --> 00:10:01,355
Mayhew! Mayhew!

107
00:10:01,609 --> 00:10:04,260
Oh, no. Sir Wilfrid, please.

108
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:07,889
Don't worry, we won't take the
brief, but an old friend needs help.

109
00:10:08,157 --> 00:10:10,888
Surely I can give him
a word of advice.

110
00:10:11,118 --> 00:10:14,918
Come on, I'll give you five minutes.
No, no, I don't want you, just Mayhew.

111
00:10:15,206 --> 00:10:17,812
Our nap! Sir Wilfrid! Our nap!

112
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:20,648
You go ahead. Start it without me.

113
00:10:21,796 --> 00:10:24,606
This is your fault. You
should not have permitted it.

114
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,447
It is not my fault. I distinctly
told Sir Wilfrid no criminal cases.

115
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:31,086
Well, if it's anyone's fault,
I expect it's mine.

116
00:10:31,305 --> 00:10:34,388
Seems silly to me, but Mr
Mayhew thinks it's very urgent.

117
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:38,442
- He thinks I may be arrested any minute.
- Arrested for what?

118
00:10:38,729 --> 00:10:40,777
Well, for murder.

119
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:42,471
Oh!

120
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:46,257
It's the case of Emily French. You've
probably seen reports in the press.

121
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:50,215
Middle-aged widow, well-off, living
with a housekeeper at Hampstead.

122
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:52,539
Mr Vole had been with her earlier.

123
00:10:52,743 --> 00:10:55,553
When the housekeeper returned,
she found her dead,

124
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,995
struck on the back of
the head and killed.

125
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:01,256
Vole seems caught in a web
of circumstantial evidence.

126
00:11:01,502 --> 00:11:05,223
Perhaps if I gave you the details you'd
suggest the strongest line of defence.

127
00:11:05,506 --> 00:11:08,953
- I'd probably think better with a cigar.
- Of course.

128
00:11:09,218 --> 00:11:13,143
No previous convictions. He's of good
character with an excellent war record.

129
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,560
- You'd like him a lot.
- They've confiscated the matches. A light.

130
00:11:17,852 --> 00:11:21,902
The defence may tum on establishing
an alibi for the night of the murder.

131
00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:26,751
- I haven't got any. Let me get you some.
- Lord, no! You don't know Miss Plimsoll.

132
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:29,640
This will take all our cunning.

133
00:11:34,535 --> 00:11:36,424
Young man!

134
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,429
Come here, please.

135
00:11:38,622 --> 00:11:42,752
Your solicitor and I feel you may be able
to enlighten me on an important point.

136
00:11:43,043 --> 00:11:45,091
- Yes. Thank you.
- Sir Wilfrid!

137
00:11:45,296 --> 00:11:48,266
You're not in bed yet? Upstairs!

138
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:54,044
- Give me a match.
- Sorry, I never carry them.

139
00:11:54,263 --> 00:11:57,107
- What? You said I'd like him.
- But I do have a lighter.

140
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:00,637
You're quite right, Mayhew,
I do like him. Thank you.

141
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:05,219
Can you imagine Miss Plimsoll's
face if she saw me now?

142
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:09,688
Then let's make absolutely
sure that she doesn't.

143
00:12:09,987 --> 00:12:13,878
Splendid. All the instincts
of a skilled criminal.

144
00:12:14,158 --> 00:12:16,923
- Thank you, sir.
- Here.

145
00:12:21,499 --> 00:12:23,900
Whether or not you murdered
a middle-aged widow,

146
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:27,767
you certainly saved the life
of an elderly barrister.

147
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,209
I haven't murdered anybody.
It's absurd.

148
00:12:30,424 --> 00:12:34,395
Christine, that's my wife, she thought
I may be implicated and needed a lawyer.

149
00:12:34,678 --> 00:12:37,807
That's why I went to see Mr Mayhew.
Now he thinks he needs a lawyer

150
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,537
and now I have two lawyers.
It's rather silly.

151
00:12:40,768 --> 00:12:42,930
I am a solicitor.
Sir Wilfrid is a barrister.

152
00:12:43,145 --> 00:12:46,149
Only a barrister can actually
plead a case in court.

153
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:50,323
- Oh, I see.
- She shall not even find the ashes.

154
00:12:53,489 --> 00:12:56,299
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

155
00:12:56,534 --> 00:13:00,380
I saw in the paper that Mrs French had
been found dead with her head bashed in.

156
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:05,385
It also said the police were anxious to
interview me since I visited that evening.

157
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:09,475
- Naturally, I went to the police station.
- Did they caution you?

158
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:13,237
I don't quite know. They asked
if I'd like to make a statement

159
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:17,753
and said they'd write it down and it might
be used against me. Is that a caution?

160
00:13:18,055 --> 00:13:20,137
Well, it can't be helped now.

161
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:24,593
- They seemed quite satisfied.
- They seemed satisfied, Mr Vole.

162
00:13:24,895 --> 00:13:28,581
He thinks that he made a statement and
that's the end of it. Isn't it obvious

163
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:33,546
that you will be regarded as the principal
suspect? I'm afraid you'll be arrested.

164
00:13:33,863 --> 00:13:36,104
I've done nothing!
Why should I be arrested?

165
00:13:36,323 --> 00:13:40,408
This is England! You don't get arrested
or convicted for crimes you haven't done.

166
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:43,229
We try not to make a habit of it.

167
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:46,930
But it does happen,
though, doesn't it?

168
00:13:47,168 --> 00:13:51,617
Of course. There was that case of that
fellow, whatshisname, Adolph Beck.

169
00:13:51,922 --> 00:13:55,085
In jail for years and they suddenly
found it was another chap.

170
00:13:55,342 --> 00:13:58,824
- He'd been innocent!
- Unfortunate, but restitution was made.

171
00:13:59,096 --> 00:14:03,226
He received a pardon, a bounty from the
crown, and was restored to normal life.

172
00:14:03,517 --> 00:14:07,158
That's all right for him. What if it
had been murder? What if he'd hanged?

173
00:14:07,438 --> 00:14:10,521
How would they have restored
him to his normal life then?

174
00:14:10,774 --> 00:14:14,984
Mr Vole, you must not take
such a morbid point of view.

175
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,170
It's just when you say these things are
closing in on me, it's like a nightmare.

176
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,978
Relax. You're in the hands of the finest,
most experienced barrister in London.

177
00:14:24,288 --> 00:14:27,735
Let's get this straight. I may have
done something highly unethical.

178
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,482
I've taken your cigar but I'm
not taking your case. I can't.

179
00:14:31,754 --> 00:14:36,681
I'm forbidden. My doctors would never
allow it. I'm truly sorry, young man.

180
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,819
But if you'd like the case
handled by these chambers,

181
00:14:40,054 --> 00:14:43,740
- I'd recommend Mr Brogan-Moore.
- Yes. A very able man.

182
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:49,386
- I second Sir Wilfrid's recommendation.
- All right, sir, if you say so.

183
00:14:52,817 --> 00:14:54,785
Hold this.

184
00:14:58,155 --> 00:14:59,316
Carter?

185
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,256
I would like to see Brogan-Moore here
as soon as he comes in from court.

186
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:06,346
Sir Wilfrid, I have never
known such insubordination.

187
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,821
Not even as a nurse during the war.

188
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,682
What war was that?
The Crimean War, no doubt.

189
00:15:13,838 --> 00:15:17,160
You'll like Brogan-Moore, he's had
excellent training. Under me.

190
00:15:17,424 --> 00:15:21,224
This morning I had no lawyers at
all and now suddenly I have three.

191
00:15:21,512 --> 00:15:24,163
We should explain that I
have very little money.

192
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,631
I shan't be able to pay
all the costs and fees.

193
00:15:26,851 --> 00:15:29,058
We'll get a fourth
lawyer to sue you.

194
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,274
He won't get very much.
I haven't had a job in four months.

195
00:15:32,523 --> 00:15:35,447
- What sort of work do you do?
- Well, uh...

196
00:15:35,693 --> 00:15:40,938
My last job was as a mechanic. The
foreman kept riding me all the time.

197
00:15:41,282 --> 00:15:44,491
- I took it as long as I could, then I quit.
- And before that?

198
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:48,873
I worked in a department store, in toys,
demonstrating children's building sets.

199
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:53,887
Of course, it lasted only during Christmas.
Before that I tested electric blankets.

200
00:15:54,211 --> 00:15:58,773
- Electric blankets?
- I suppose you think I'm a bit of a drifter.

201
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,571
It's true, in a way,
but I'm really not like that.

202
00:16:01,802 --> 00:16:06,171
My army service unsettled me. That and
living abroad. I was stationed in Germany.

203
00:16:06,474 --> 00:16:09,080
It was fine there, though.
That's where I met my wife.

204
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:13,759
She was an actress, and a good one.
She's a wonderful wife to me, too.

205
00:16:14,064 --> 00:16:16,670
But I haven't been much of
a provider, I'm afraid.

206
00:16:16,901 --> 00:16:21,304
Somehow, I just don't seem able to settle
down now I've come back to this country.

207
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:25,539
- If I could just put my eggbeater across.
- Eggbeater?

208
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:31,291
Yes, sir. I, uh, I'm a bit of an inventor.
Nothing big, just little household things.

209
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:34,673
Pocket pencil sharpeners,
key chain flashlights.

210
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:37,126
But my best is really
this eggbeater.

211
00:16:37,338 --> 00:16:40,660
It not only beats, it also
separates the yolk from the white.

212
00:16:40,925 --> 00:16:43,246
Is that really desirable?

213
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,915
If you were a housewife,
you'd see it right away.

214
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:49,267
The trouble is, I need money for
manufacturing and promotion.

215
00:16:49,517 --> 00:16:53,408
I was really hoping that's what Mrs
French might do for me after I met her.

216
00:16:53,687 --> 00:16:58,853
- Exactly how did you meet Mrs French?
- That's rather funny in itself.

217
00:16:59,193 --> 00:17:02,834
It was 3 September. I remember
because it's my wife's birthday.

218
00:17:03,113 --> 00:17:05,844
I was window-shopping
in Oxford Street,

219
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:10,842
daydreaming about what I'd buy
for her, if I had any money.

220
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,045
- You really like this one?
- Very much.

221
00:18:00,254 --> 00:18:02,700
- You don't think it's too mad?
- Mad?

222
00:18:02,923 --> 00:18:07,212
Not at all. Daring, perhaps. I wouldn't
recommend it to every woman. But you?

223
00:18:07,511 --> 00:18:10,276
- Why shouldn't you attract attention?
- You think so?

224
00:18:10,514 --> 00:18:13,802
Absolutely. But if I could
suggest one little thing.

225
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:18,223
Perhaps we could tip it and bring it back
a bit like that. Show more of your face.

226
00:18:19,815 --> 00:18:22,546
- My bus. Goodbye.
- Good...

227
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:26,182
You buy that hat. I insist.

228
00:18:27,198 --> 00:18:31,760
Actually, it was a ridiculous sort of hat-
a silly thing with ribbons and flowers.

229
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:36,366
I'm constantly surprised that women's
hats do not provoke more murders.

230
00:18:36,665 --> 00:18:37,951
Go on, please.

231
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,605
I was only trying to be nice
to make her feel good.

232
00:18:40,836 --> 00:18:43,043
I never dreamed I'd see
her again. Or the hat.

233
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,417
- But you did?
- Yes, a few weeks later.

234
00:18:45,633 --> 00:18:51,083
Again, by accident. I was peddling my
eggbeaters and business was a little slow.

235
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:17,711
Would you mind, madam? Your hat.

236
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:20,244
- Oh, it's you!
- Hello!

237
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,702
It's your fault, you know.
You chose it yourself.

238
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:26,125
- May I?
- Sure, if you like.

239
00:19:30,094 --> 00:19:34,577
Thank you. It's such a bother taking
it off and putting it back on again.

240
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:39,737
That chap is Jesse James. They've led
him into an ambush. It's not at all cricket.

241
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:42,463
- Don't worry, he shoots his way out.
- He does?

242
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,375
- I've seen it. I got to the movies a lot.
- You do?

243
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:50,740
I get restless so I go out. Then I find
I've no place to go so I go to the movies.

244
00:19:51,073 --> 00:19:55,123
Sometimes I see the same one
two or three times. Ooh.

245
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:57,937
- Toffee?
- Oh, yes, please.

246
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:01,054
At this time you had no idea
that Mrs French was well-off?

247
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:04,341
No. Absolutely not. We were
sitting in the cheap seats.

248
00:20:04,587 --> 00:20:08,273
All I knew was she seemed to be very
lonely, had no friends whatsoever.

249
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:11,234
She and her husband lived
abroad in British Nigeria.

250
00:20:11,469 --> 00:20:15,872
He was in the colonial service.
He died in '45, of a heart attack.

251
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:19,345
Please, Mayhew, not when
I'm smoking. Go on, young man.

252
00:20:19,602 --> 00:20:22,685
Well, they finally
polished off Jesse James,

253
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:26,260
and after we left the movie she
invited me to her house for tea.

254
00:20:30,321 --> 00:20:34,121
I think it's the most fascinating thing
I've ever seen. Janet, come and look.

255
00:20:34,408 --> 00:20:36,376
I've seen eggbeaters before, ma'am.

256
00:20:36,577 --> 00:20:39,547
But this beats so quickly
and it separates too!

257
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:42,712
It must be cen-trifugal or
centrifugal, which is it?

258
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,484
It's specific gravity,
but it whips cream too.

259
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:48,715
Did you hear that, Janet?
It whips cream too.

260
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:51,365
We must have one. Is it expensive?

261
00:20:51,592 --> 00:20:54,914
Compliments of the inventor,
manufacturer and sole distributor.

262
00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:59,025
Thank you. We'll use it constantly,
won't we, Janet?

263
00:20:59,308 --> 00:21:03,757
Come, we'd better get out of here.
Janet doesn't like visitors in her kitchen.

264
00:21:10,778 --> 00:21:12,348
Ha!

265
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:17,535
It's a bit chilly in here, isn't it?
Shall we have a fire?

266
00:21:17,785 --> 00:21:19,753
Why not?

267
00:21:19,954 --> 00:21:22,525
This is a charming room.

268
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:26,878
Hubert and I collected all these
things when we lived in Africa.

269
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:29,331
Hubert was my husband.

270
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:33,157
Well, now, there's a loveable chap.

271
00:21:33,384 --> 00:21:35,785
That's the mask of
the witch doctor.

272
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:38,412
He wore it when he pulled
our servants' teeth.

273
00:21:38,639 --> 00:21:42,246
So Hubert used to call
him a witch dentist.

274
00:21:43,352 --> 00:21:46,561
- Hubert was so witty.
- Yes, I can see that.

275
00:21:46,814 --> 00:21:48,942
Oh, here's tea.

276
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:56,005
- Let's use our good silver and china.
- Oh, no, don't bother, Mrs French.

277
00:21:56,323 --> 00:21:59,213
- This is perfectly all right.
- Lemon or milk, please?

278
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,818
- I don't really care.
- Would you prefer sherry?

279
00:22:02,037 --> 00:22:04,005
- That'd be fine.
- We've no' got any.

280
00:22:04,206 --> 00:22:08,370
Oh, but we have. There's that bottle,
the one we bought last Christmas.

281
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:13,470
If you care for an eggnog there's a wasted
egg in the kitchen ready and separated.

282
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:18,487
Do sit down. Don't mind Janet, Mr Vole.
It's just that she's terribly Scotch.

283
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:22,206
Oh, is she? I thought she
came with the collection.

284
00:22:23,434 --> 00:22:27,234
You know, maybe I'll take
a glass of sherry myself.

285
00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:30,206
I feel like Christmas, somehow.

286
00:22:31,525 --> 00:22:36,008
After that I saw her once or twice a week.
She always kept a bottle of sherry for me.

287
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:39,246
We'd talk, play canasta,
listen to gramophone records,

288
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:41,620
Gilbert and Sullivan mostly.

289
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:45,991
It's so weird to think of her now,
lying in that living room, murdered.

290
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:50,659
I assure you she's been moved by now.
To leave her would be unfeeling, unlawful,

291
00:22:50,961 --> 00:22:52,929
and unsanitary.

292
00:22:55,591 --> 00:22:58,197
Tell Sir Wilfrid about the
evening of the murder.

293
00:22:59,053 --> 00:23:01,579
I went around to see her
about eight o'clock.

294
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:04,650
She fixed a sandwich,
we talked, listened to The Mikado.

295
00:23:04,892 --> 00:23:08,817
I left about nine. I walked home.
I got there about half past.

296
00:23:09,104 --> 00:23:13,075
I can prove that. I can swear to it, in or out
of court, in the witness box, anywhere!

297
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,930
How much money did you
get from Mrs French?

298
00:23:16,153 --> 00:23:18,155
- Nothing.
- The truth. How much?

299
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:21,971
- Why should she give me any money?
- Because she was in love with you.

300
00:23:22,243 --> 00:23:24,211
That's ridiculous. She liked me.

301
00:23:24,411 --> 00:23:27,335
She pampered me like an aunt.
But that's all, I swear.

302
00:23:27,581 --> 00:23:30,232
- Why didn't you tell her you had a wife?
- I did!

303
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:33,668
But you never took your wife along
when you went there. Why not?

304
00:23:33,921 --> 00:23:35,685
- Because...
- Because what?

305
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:39,328
Because she was under the impression
we didn't get along too well.

306
00:23:39,593 --> 00:23:41,914
- Is that true?
- No! We love each other.

307
00:23:42,138 --> 00:23:45,938
- Then how did she get that impression?
- She just seemed to want to believe it.

308
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:49,513
- You never corrected her. Why?
- I was afraid she'd lose interest.

309
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:53,013
Because she was rich, and
you were after her money.

310
00:23:53,274 --> 00:23:55,276
Well, yes, in a way.

311
00:23:55,985 --> 00:24:00,627
I was hoping for a loan for my new
invention. Just a few hundred pounds.

312
00:24:00,948 --> 00:24:04,111
An honest business proposition,
that's all. Is that so wicked?

313
00:24:04,368 --> 00:24:06,450
You knew it was the
housekeeper's day off?

314
00:24:06,662 --> 00:24:09,268
- Well, yes.
- You went there because she'd be alone?

315
00:24:09,498 --> 00:24:11,944
No, because I thought
she might be lonely.

316
00:24:12,168 --> 00:24:15,809
All right, lonely. You and the rich
lonely widow all alone in that house

317
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:18,853
with a gramophone
blaring The Mikado.

318
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:21,662
Perhaps you turned up the
volume to drown her cries.

319
00:24:21,886 --> 00:24:26,335
- When I left her she was alive!
- When Janet came back she was dead.

320
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,440
The house had been ransacked! It said
in the papers. It must've been a burglar.

321
00:24:30,728 --> 00:24:33,937
I didn't do it. No matter how bad
things look, I didn't do it!

322
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:38,354
You must believe me.
You do believe me, don't you?

323
00:24:39,528 --> 00:24:41,576
I do now, but I wasn't sure.

324
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,148
That's why I subjected your eyes
and my arteries to that ordeal.

325
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:47,616
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

326
00:24:47,828 --> 00:24:51,594
As for things looking bad, they don't
look bad, Mr Vole, they look terrible.

327
00:24:51,874 --> 00:24:56,038
- Apparently you've no alibi at all.
- But I have. I left Mrs French's at nine.

328
00:24:56,337 --> 00:24:59,546
- By bus or underground?
- No, I walked. It was a fine night.

329
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:02,723
- Did anyone see you?
- Christine saw me when I got home.

330
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:07,929
It was 9.26. I know because I went right to
work on a clock I've been tinkering with.

331
00:25:08,265 --> 00:25:10,916
- My wife will tell you.
- Your wife loves you, yes?

332
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:13,384
Very much. We're
devoted to each other.

333
00:25:13,604 --> 00:25:18,644
You realise, Mr Vole, the testimony of a
devoted wife does not carry much weight.

334
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,635
People might think Christine
would lie on my account?

335
00:25:21,862 --> 00:25:25,662
It has been known, Mr Vole.
Blood is thicker than evidence.

336
00:25:27,034 --> 00:25:31,642
- Ah, Brogan-Moore. Come in, come in.
- So good to have you out of hospital.

337
00:25:31,956 --> 00:25:36,644
I didn't get a full pardon, I'm out on
parole. You know Mr Mayhew, I believe.

338
00:25:36,961 --> 00:25:39,646
- This is his client, Mr Leonard Vole.
- How do you do?

339
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,167
- How do you do?
- The Emily French murder.

340
00:25:42,383 --> 00:25:44,670
- Oh, how do you do?
- Badly, thank you.

341
00:25:44,885 --> 00:25:48,776
A mass of circumstantial evidence.
No alibi whatsoever. It's a hot potato.

342
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,297
- Tossing it into your lap.
- Much obliged.

343
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:54,521
Your line of defence,
however, will be lack of motive.

344
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,774
You will agree that we can rule
out a crime of passion, hm?

345
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:00,708
That leaves us with a
murder for profit.

346
00:26:00,943 --> 00:26:04,914
If Mr Vole had been sponging off Mrs
French, why cut off the source of supply?

347
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:09,646
Or, if he'd been hoping for a golden egg,
why kill the goose before it was laid?

348
00:26:09,952 --> 00:26:12,876
No motive. No motive whatsoever.

349
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:19,341
- You find some flaw in this reasoning?
- No, no, it's very sound as far as it goes.

350
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:23,880
Well, it's all yours. You'll find Mr Vole
very responsive and quite candid.

351
00:26:24,175 --> 00:26:27,418
So candid, he's already told me
we'll have to sue him for our fees.

352
00:26:27,678 --> 00:26:31,364
Oh, we'll simply put a
lean on Mr Vole's £80,000.

353
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,884
- What £80,000?
- The £80,000 Mrs French left you.

354
00:26:36,187 --> 00:26:37,313
Left me?

355
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,441
They opened Mrs French's bank
vault today and found her will.

356
00:26:43,486 --> 00:26:47,650
- Congratulations.
- £80,000!

357
00:26:47,948 --> 00:26:51,395
And I was worried about a couple of
hundred for that silly eggbeater.

358
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,628
I must call Christine.

359
00:26:57,792 --> 00:26:59,237
Oh.

360
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:02,308
This doesn't make things look
any better for me, does it?

361
00:27:02,546 --> 00:27:05,868
- No. I wouldn't think so.
- So now they'll say I did have a motive.

362
00:27:06,133 --> 00:27:11,458
They will indeed. £80,000 makes
for a very handsome motive.

363
00:27:11,806 --> 00:27:14,377
I thought you were crazy but
now they will arrest me!

364
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,568
It's not unlikely.

365
00:27:23,984 --> 00:27:27,272
As a matter of fact, it's quite likely.
They're on their way up now.

366
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:31,899
I knew nothing about that will. I'd no idea
she'd any intention of leaving me money.

367
00:27:32,201 --> 00:27:36,445
- If I didn't know, how can it be a motive?
- We'll certainly bring that out in court.

368
00:27:36,747 --> 00:27:41,116
- It's our old friend Inspector Hearne.
- Chief Inspector as of last month.

369
00:27:41,418 --> 00:27:44,945
Chief Inspector? They must think
a lot of you at Scotland Yard.

370
00:27:45,214 --> 00:27:47,785
You're getting the
deluxe treatment.

371
00:27:48,008 --> 00:27:53,174
- Oh, in here, Chief Inspector.
- Sorry to disturb you in your chambers.

372
00:27:53,514 --> 00:27:57,121
That's perfectly all right. I never
object to the actions of the police

373
00:27:57,393 --> 00:28:01,079
- except once in a great while in court.
- Yes, sir, I still have the scars.

374
00:28:01,355 --> 00:28:03,722
You know Mr Mayhew,
Mr Brogan-Moore.

375
00:28:03,941 --> 00:28:08,344
This is Leonard Vole. You'd better search
him, he may be armed with an eggbeater.

376
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:11,225
- Is your name Leonard Vole?
- Yes, it is.

377
00:28:11,448 --> 00:28:16,932
I have a warrant for your arrest on
the charge of murdering Emily French.

378
00:28:17,288 --> 00:28:22,089
I must warn you that anything you say
may be taken down and used in evidence.

379
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:25,262
Well, I'm ready.
Must I be handcuffed?

380
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:27,905
That won't be necessary, sir.

381
00:28:28,132 --> 00:28:31,534
I've never been arrested before,
not even for walking a dog off a lead

382
00:28:31,802 --> 00:28:35,488
- or having a beer after hours.
- There's no disgrace in being arrested.

383
00:28:35,764 --> 00:28:40,930
Kings, prime ministers, archbishops,
even barristers have stood in the dock.

384
00:28:45,608 --> 00:28:49,454
- Somebody better call my wife.
- I will, don't worry.

385
00:28:49,737 --> 00:28:51,865
I'll go too, see you're
properly charged.

386
00:28:52,072 --> 00:28:54,882
- You will see to it that he is well-treated?
- We will.

387
00:28:55,117 --> 00:28:58,758
Would you like a cigar? Pardon me.

388
00:28:59,997 --> 00:29:04,764
- That's very kind of you, Sir Wilfrid.
- I'd better not. It would constitute a bribe.

389
00:29:06,587 --> 00:29:08,555
We ought to be going, Mr Vole.

390
00:29:12,927 --> 00:29:16,773
One thing I've learned for sure, never
look in a window with women's hats.

391
00:29:17,056 --> 00:29:19,024
Good day, sir.

392
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,267
Makes a very nice
impression, doesn't he?

393
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:27,609
- Yes, rather. Give him the monocle test?
- Passed with flying colours.

394
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,302
I hope he does as well in the dock.
This is sticky, you know.

395
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:35,256
Of course. The prosecution will blast
in with their heaviest artillery.

396
00:29:35,533 --> 00:29:39,902
All you'll have is one little popgun,
an alibi furnished by his wife.

397
00:29:40,204 --> 00:29:42,206
Isn't that an intriguing challenge?

398
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:46,260
I think I'd like it more if it was less
of a challenge and less intriguing.

399
00:29:47,294 --> 00:29:52,255
Miss Plimsoll has issued an ultimatum.
In bed in one minute or she'll resign.

400
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:55,834
Splendid. Give her a month's pay
and kick her down the stairs.

401
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:59,099
Either you take care of yourself
or I, too, shall resign.

402
00:29:59,348 --> 00:30:01,828
This is blackmail.
But you're quite right.

403
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:06,030
For my first day this has already been
rather hectic. I should be in bed.

404
00:30:10,234 --> 00:30:14,000
I'd better get in touch with Mrs Vole
and have her come over. Will you sit in?

405
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:20,242
Thank you, no. I'm in no condition to cope
with emotional wives drenched in tears.

406
00:30:21,495 --> 00:30:26,535
Miss Plimsoll, how alluring you look,
waiting like a hangman on the scaffold.

407
00:30:26,876 --> 00:30:29,038
Take me, I'm yours.

408
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:31,866
Oh!

409
00:30:32,006 --> 00:30:36,409
About Mrs Vole. Handle her gently,
especially when you tell her of the arrest.

410
00:30:36,719 --> 00:30:41,281
Bear in mind she's a foreigner, so prepare
for hysterics, even a fainting spell.

411
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,604
Better have smelling salts ready,
box of tissues and a nip of brandy.

412
00:30:45,895 --> 00:30:49,297
I do not think that
will be necessary.

413
00:30:52,485 --> 00:30:54,965
I never faint in case
I don't fall gracefully,

414
00:30:55,196 --> 00:30:58,882
and I never use smelling salts
because they puff up the eyes.

415
00:30:59,158 --> 00:31:01,559
I'm Christine Vole.

416
00:31:01,785 --> 00:31:04,311
How do you do?
This is Mr Brogan-Moore.

417
00:31:04,538 --> 00:31:06,506
How do you do?

418
00:31:06,707 --> 00:31:09,631
- I am Wilfrid Robarts.
- How do you do?

419
00:31:09,877 --> 00:31:12,687
My dear Mrs Vole, I'm afraid
we have bad news for you.

420
00:31:12,922 --> 00:31:17,723
- Don't be afraid, I'm quite disciplined.
- There's nothing to be alarmed about yet.

421
00:31:18,052 --> 00:31:21,499
Leonard has been arrested and
charged with murder. Is that it?

422
00:31:21,764 --> 00:31:25,086
- Yes.
- I knew he would be, I told him so.

423
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:27,877
I'm glad you're showing
such fortitude.

424
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:31,073
Call it what you like.
What is the next step?

425
00:31:31,774 --> 00:31:34,300
Your husband will have to
stand trial, I'm afraid.

426
00:31:34,527 --> 00:31:39,533
Will you explain the procedure?
Mr Brogan-Moore will lead the defence.

427
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:41,196
Oh?

428
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:44,098
- You will not defend Leonard?
- Regrettably not.

429
00:31:44,328 --> 00:31:46,808
My health, or, rather,
the lack of it, forbids me.

430
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:52,284
It is regrettable. Mr Mayhew described
you as champion of the hopeless cause.

431
00:31:55,673 --> 00:31:59,473
Is it, perhaps, that this
cause is too hopeless?

432
00:32:06,684 --> 00:32:11,485
I'll have a serious talk with Dr Harrison.
It was a mistake to let you come back here.

433
00:32:11,814 --> 00:32:14,340
I should have taken you to
a rest-home or a resort.

434
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:16,934
Some place quiet,
far off, like Bermuda.

435
00:32:17,153 --> 00:32:19,997
Shut up. You just want to see
me in those nasty shorts.

436
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:23,402
Come now, Sir Wilfrid,
you must not think of it.

437
00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:27,505
You must get ready for sleep,
think beautiful thoughts.

438
00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:33,784
Now, let's get undressed. Put these on,
tops and bottoms, while I make your bed.

439
00:32:34,128 --> 00:32:37,052
After your rest we'll
have a nice cup of cocoa.

440
00:32:37,298 --> 00:32:40,268
Then perhaps we'll have a
walk around the square.

441
00:32:40,509 --> 00:32:43,080
You know, I feel sorry
for that nice Mr Vole.

442
00:32:43,304 --> 00:32:47,673
And not just because he was arrested,
but that wife of his. She must be German.

443
00:32:47,975 --> 00:32:52,458
That's what happens when we let our
boys cross the Channel. They go crazy.

444
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:57,174
The government should do something
about foreign wives. Like an embargo.

445
00:32:57,485 --> 00:33:01,251
How else can we take care of our own
surplus. Don't you agree, Sir Wilfrid?

446
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:03,851
All right. Hop in!

447
00:33:05,034 --> 00:33:07,355
Sir Wilfrid?

448
00:33:10,247 --> 00:33:11,931
Sir Wilfrid!

449
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:13,853
Come back!

450
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:18,855
Yes, of course I knew that Leonard had
been seeing Mrs French quite frequently.

451
00:33:19,173 --> 00:33:20,299
Go on.

452
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:24,073
I knew when he came home with a pair
of green socks she'd knitted for him.

453
00:33:24,345 --> 00:33:27,428
That's quite natural. I'm sure
a jury will find it endearing.

454
00:33:27,681 --> 00:33:31,527
Leonard can be very endearing.
He hates that particular shade of green

455
00:33:31,811 --> 00:33:33,893
and the socks were
two sizes too large,

456
00:33:34,104 --> 00:33:36,710
but he wore them just the
same to give her pleasure.

457
00:33:36,941 --> 00:33:38,909
Leonard has a way with women.

458
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:44,673
I only hope he has an all-woman jury.
They will carry him from court in triumph.

459
00:33:45,032 --> 00:33:49,879
A simple acquittal will do. Now, you know
Mrs French left your husband money?

460
00:33:50,204 --> 00:33:52,206
Yes. A lot of money.

461
00:33:52,414 --> 00:33:57,102
Of course, your husband had no
previous knowledge of this bequest?

462
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:59,581
Is that what he told you?

463
00:33:59,797 --> 00:34:02,198
Surely you're not
suggesting different?

464
00:34:02,424 --> 00:34:06,315
Oh, no, no. I do not
suggest anything.

465
00:34:06,595 --> 00:34:12,238
Clearly, she had come to look upon your
husband as a son or favourite nephew.

466
00:34:13,102 --> 00:34:16,788
You think Mrs French looked upon
Leonard as a son? Or a nephew?

467
00:34:17,064 --> 00:34:20,591
I do. An entirely natural and
understandable relationship.

468
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:24,103
What hypocrites you
are in this country.

469
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:28,318
Pardon me, Brogan-Moore.

470
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:32,983
- Do you mind if I ask you a question?
- Go right ahead, Sir Wilfrid.

471
00:34:33,289 --> 00:34:37,180
You realise your husband's entire
defence rests on his word and yours?

472
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,748
- I realise that.
- And that the jury will be quite sceptical

473
00:34:41,005 --> 00:34:44,976
of the word of a man accused of murder
when supported only by that of his wife?

474
00:34:45,259 --> 00:34:47,990
- I realise that too.
- Let us, then, at least make sure

475
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:51,906
- the two are not in conflict.
- By all means, let's.

476
00:34:52,183 --> 00:34:54,754
I assume you want to
help your husband?

477
00:34:54,977 --> 00:35:00,427
Of course I want to help Leonard. I want
to help Mr Brogan-Moore and to help you.

478
00:35:00,774 --> 00:35:04,745
There. Isn't that more
comfortable for you?

479
00:35:05,529 --> 00:35:08,692
Now, Mrs Vole.
This is very important.

480
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:12,715
On the night of the murder your husband
came home before 9:30. Correct?

481
00:35:12,995 --> 00:35:16,283
Precisely. Isn't that
what he wants me to say?

482
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,429
Isn't it the truth?

483
00:35:18,626 --> 00:35:20,435
Of course.

484
00:35:20,628 --> 00:35:23,438
But when I told the police,
I do not think they believed me.

485
00:35:23,672 --> 00:35:26,755
Maybe I didn't say it well.
Maybe because of my accent.

486
00:35:27,009 --> 00:35:29,216
My dear Mrs Vole, in our courts

487
00:35:29,428 --> 00:35:32,591
we accept the evidence of witnesses
who speak only Bulgarian

488
00:35:32,848 --> 00:35:35,374
and who must have an interpreter.

489
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:38,764
We accept the evidence of
deaf-mutes who cannot speak at all,

490
00:35:39,021 --> 00:35:41,308
as long as they tell the truth.

491
00:35:41,524 --> 00:35:44,767
You're aware that when you're in
the witness box you will be sworn

492
00:35:45,027 --> 00:35:47,997
- and you will testify under oath?
- Yes.

493
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:51,960
Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely
and did not go out again.

494
00:35:52,243 --> 00:35:57,204
The truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth. Is that better?

495
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:03,877
- Mrs Vole, do you love your husband?
- Leonard thinks I do.

496
00:36:04,213 --> 00:36:07,820
- Well, do you?
- Am I already under oath?

497
00:36:08,092 --> 00:36:11,301
Whatever your gambit may be,
do you know that, under British law,

498
00:36:11,554 --> 00:36:15,445
you cannot be called to give
testimony damaging to your husband?

499
00:36:15,724 --> 00:36:17,852
How very convenient.

500
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,142
We are dealing with
a capital crime.

501
00:36:20,354 --> 00:36:23,995
The prosecution will try
to hang your husband.

502
00:36:25,234 --> 00:36:27,805
He is not my husband.

503
00:36:34,243 --> 00:36:36,644
Leonard and I went through
a form of marriage,

504
00:36:36,871 --> 00:36:40,637
but I had a husband living somewhere
in East Germany, in the Russian zone.

505
00:36:40,916 --> 00:36:44,716
- Did you tell Leonard?
- I did not. It would have been stupid.

506
00:36:45,004 --> 00:36:48,975
He would not have married me and I'd
have been left to starve in the rubble.

507
00:36:49,258 --> 00:36:51,784
But he did marry you and
brought you safely here.

508
00:36:52,011 --> 00:36:54,218
Don't you think you
should be grateful?

509
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:56,478
One can get very
tired of gratitude.

510
00:36:56,682 --> 00:36:59,288
Your husband loves you
very much, does he not?

511
00:36:59,518 --> 00:37:02,681
Leonard? He worships
the ground I walk on.

512
00:37:02,938 --> 00:37:05,066
And you?

513
00:37:05,274 --> 00:37:07,561
You want to know too much.

514
00:37:07,776 --> 00:37:10,143
Auf Wiedersehen, gentlemen.

515
00:37:11,322 --> 00:37:16,533
Thank you for coming in, Mrs Vole.
Your visit has been most reassuring.

516
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:21,397
Do not worry, Sir Wilfrid. I will give him
an alibi and I shall be very convincing.

517
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:26,508
There will be tears in my eyes when I say
"Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely."

518
00:37:26,837 --> 00:37:30,558
You're a very remarkable
woman, Mrs Vole.

519
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:34,168
And you're satisfied, I hope?

520
00:37:35,596 --> 00:37:41,000
- I'm damned if I'm satisfied!
- Care for a whiff of those smelling salts?

521
00:37:41,352 --> 00:37:43,798
That woman's up to something.
But what?

522
00:37:44,021 --> 00:37:47,912
The prosecution will break her down in
no time when she's in the witness box.

523
00:37:48,192 --> 00:37:51,560
This case is going to be rather like
the charge of the Light Brigade

524
00:37:51,821 --> 00:37:55,462
or one of those Japanese
suicide pilots. Quite one-sided.

525
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:58,062
With the odds all
on the other side.

526
00:37:58,285 --> 00:38:00,731
I haven't got much
to go on, have I?

527
00:38:00,955 --> 00:38:03,435
The fact is, I've got nothing.

528
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:06,753
Let me ask you something.

529
00:38:06,961 --> 00:38:10,329
Do you believe Leonard
Vole is innocent?

530
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:15,393
Do you?

531
00:38:16,846 --> 00:38:19,167
Do you?

532
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,358
I'm not sure.

533
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:25,006
Oh, I'm sorry, Wilfrid.
Of course, I'll do my best.

534
00:38:25,271 --> 00:38:27,956
It's all right, Brogan-Moore.

535
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,761
I'll take it from here.

536
00:38:32,153 --> 00:38:37,000
I have called Dr Harrison and given him
a report on your shocking behaviour.

537
00:38:37,324 --> 00:38:39,691
- Give me a match, Miss Plimsoll.
- Sir Wilfrid!

538
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:42,834
Did you hear me? A match!

539
00:39:14,737 --> 00:39:20,506
Mr Mayhew. Sir Wilfrid. I'm told you are
going to represent me. I'm very grateful.

540
00:39:20,868 --> 00:39:26,034
I struck a bargain with my doctors. They
exile me to Bermuda as soon as we finish.

541
00:39:26,373 --> 00:39:28,899
- Thank you.
- There's hope that we'll both survive.

542
00:39:29,126 --> 00:39:31,288
- Get into these. We need a photograph.
- Why?

543
00:39:31,504 --> 00:39:33,472
This is what you were
wearing that night.

544
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:37,438
We'll circulate a photo on the chance
that someone saw you on your way home.

545
00:39:37,718 --> 00:39:40,085
Over here against the wall, please.

546
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:45,446
Hold it. One more
in profile, please.

547
00:39:45,684 --> 00:39:49,086
Do we really need this? My wife knows
what time I came home that night.

548
00:39:49,355 --> 00:39:51,961
A disinterested witness
may be of more value.

549
00:39:52,191 --> 00:39:54,956
Yes, of course, Christine
is an interested witness.

550
00:39:55,194 --> 00:39:57,401
I'll pick up the negatives later.
Thank you.

551
00:39:57,613 --> 00:40:01,584
I don't understand it.
Why hasn't she come to see me?

552
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:06,312
Won't they let her see me?
I mean, it's been two weeks now.

553
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,106
Mayhew, give me the reports.

554
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:12,382
Have you been talking to her?
Is there something the matter?

555
00:40:12,628 --> 00:40:17,555
I want to read a portion of the evidence
of Janet McKenzie, the housekeeper.

556
00:40:21,804 --> 00:40:25,251
"Mr Vole helped Mrs French
with her business affairs,

557
00:40:25,516 --> 00:40:27,564
particularly her
income tax returns."

558
00:40:27,768 --> 00:40:30,578
Oh, yes, I did. Some of those
forms are very complicated.

559
00:40:30,813 --> 00:40:33,976
There's also a hint you may have
helped her draft her new will.

560
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:37,123
Well, that's not true!
If Janet said that she's lying.

561
00:40:37,361 --> 00:40:39,967
She was always against me,
I don't know why!

562
00:40:40,197 --> 00:40:46,159
It's obvious. You threw an eggbeater into
the wheels of her Victorian household.

563
00:40:46,537 --> 00:40:50,144
Now, this cut in your wrist. You
say you cut yourself with a knife?

564
00:40:50,416 --> 00:40:53,977
Well, that's true, I did. I was
cutting bread and the knife slipped.

565
00:40:54,253 --> 00:41:00,704
But that was two days after. Christine
was there. She'll tell them in her evidence.

566
00:41:02,219 --> 00:41:06,224
Are you keeping something from me?
Is she ill? Was she shocked?

567
00:41:06,515 --> 00:41:10,406
All things considered, she took it well.
Though that may be only on the surface.

568
00:41:10,686 --> 00:41:14,054
Wives are often profoundly
disturbed at such a time.

569
00:41:14,315 --> 00:41:17,205
Yes, it must be hard. We've
never been separated before.

570
00:41:17,443 --> 00:41:21,607
- Not since our first meeting.
- How did you meet your wife, Mr Vole?

571
00:41:21,906 --> 00:41:23,874
In Germany in 1945.

572
00:41:25,075 --> 00:41:30,525
It's rather funny. The very first time
I saw her, the ceiling fell right in on me.

573
00:41:30,873 --> 00:41:34,480
I was stationed outside Hamburg,
with an RAF maintenance unit.

574
00:41:34,752 --> 00:41:40,077
I'd just installed a shower in the officers'
billet, so they gave me a weekend pass.

575
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:44,686
Come on!

596
00:42:58,252 --> 00:43:01,301
Hey, Fräulein, show us some legs.

597
00:43:01,547 --> 00:43:05,518
They rob you blind and then
throw you a ruddy sailor!

598
00:43:05,801 --> 00:43:09,203
- Come on, let's see 'em.
- We want legs!

599
00:43:10,097 --> 00:43:13,180
Come help the cabaret
out of her trousers!

600
00:43:13,434 --> 00:43:16,643
All right, Fräulein, if you
won't show 'em, I will.

601
00:43:43,631 --> 00:43:47,795
All right, outside, everybody.
Come on, let's go.

602
00:44:01,732 --> 00:44:02,779
Come on.

603
00:44:04,693 --> 00:44:07,458
Bring him round to the other truck.

604
00:44:11,659 --> 00:44:14,583
We'll be back, baby! We'll be back!

605
00:44:52,116 --> 00:44:54,084
Gesundheit.

606
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,651
- What are you looking for?
- My accordion.

607
00:45:03,878 --> 00:45:05,880
Oh, let me help you.

608
00:45:09,216 --> 00:45:13,062
- I think I found it.
- Step on it again, it's still breathing.

609
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:17,251
I'm terribly sorry.

610
00:45:17,475 --> 00:45:19,682
You better go. We've
had trouble enough.

611
00:45:19,894 --> 00:45:23,785
Well, it's your own fault. That costume
in the picture gave the boys ideas

612
00:45:24,064 --> 00:45:28,274
- then those trousers let them down hard.
- That costume went in the first raid.

613
00:45:28,569 --> 00:45:31,971
Then raid by raid, my other dresses,
and now you've bombed my trousers.

614
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:34,207
Cigarette? Gum?

615
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:45,457
You're burning my nose.

616
00:45:45,669 --> 00:45:48,070
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

617
00:45:48,297 --> 00:45:50,743
How about a cup of coffee?
I've got a tin of coffee.

618
00:45:50,966 --> 00:45:52,456
How much?

619
00:45:52,635 --> 00:45:54,717
I don't know. What's
the rate of exchange?

620
00:45:54,929 --> 00:45:58,729
- Depends whether it's fresh or powdered.
- It's instant coffee.

621
00:45:59,016 --> 00:46:00,984
Got any hot water at your place?

622
00:46:01,185 --> 00:46:04,473
- Sometimes.
- Let's take a chance. Where do you live?

623
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:06,300
Nearby.

624
00:46:07,233 --> 00:46:08,997
Come.

625
00:46:15,449 --> 00:46:17,497
Sorry, it's the maid's night off.

626
00:46:17,701 --> 00:46:21,183
This is pretty horrible.
In a gemütlich sort of way.

627
00:46:21,455 --> 00:46:24,902
Oh, it's fine now. I used to
have a roommate. A dancer.

628
00:46:25,167 --> 00:46:28,410
She had luck, she married a Canadian.
She now lives in Toronto.

629
00:46:28,671 --> 00:46:31,322
She has a Ford automobile.

630
00:46:31,549 --> 00:46:34,519
Make yourself comfortable,
the stove is slow these days.

631
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,889
That's all right,
I've got a weekend pass.

632
00:46:38,139 --> 00:46:41,621
No, not that chair. It holds up the
beam and that holds up the ceiling.

633
00:46:41,892 --> 00:46:44,179
You'd better sit down on the cot.

634
00:46:44,395 --> 00:46:46,045
The cot?

635
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:49,632
Getting more gemütlich all
the time. Are you married?

636
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,743
- Why?
- Well, the, um...

637
00:46:51,944 --> 00:46:54,470
Oh, that. No, no, I'm not married.

638
00:46:54,697 --> 00:46:58,463
I just wear it when I'm working. Gives
a little protection with all the men.

639
00:46:58,742 --> 00:47:03,304
- Didn't work too well tonight, did it?
- No, tonight was bad.

640
00:47:03,622 --> 00:47:05,784
But it's getting better.

641
00:47:09,587 --> 00:47:12,636
- Where's the coffee?
- Ah, coffee, ja voll.

642
00:47:12,882 --> 00:47:18,844
Finest Brazilian blend. The same brand
that Field Marshal Montgomery drinks.

643
00:47:35,821 --> 00:47:38,222
Is that a fair rate of exchange?

644
00:47:38,449 --> 00:47:40,417
Very fair.

645
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:45,540
Would you be interested
in having the whole tin?

646
00:47:45,831 --> 00:47:47,799
I would.

647
00:47:56,884 --> 00:48:00,684
- How are you fixed for sugar?
- I could use some.

648
00:48:00,971 --> 00:48:02,655
Milk?

649
00:48:02,848 --> 00:48:04,612
Sure.

650
00:48:06,435 --> 00:48:08,597
Milk. Sugar.

651
00:48:09,855 --> 00:48:12,176
It's a pleasure to do
business with you.

652
00:48:12,399 --> 00:48:14,163
Yeah.

653
00:48:19,323 --> 00:48:23,169
I also carry biscuits,
powdered eggs,

654
00:48:23,452 --> 00:48:27,821
- bacon, marmalade.
- I don't know if I can afford it.

655
00:48:28,124 --> 00:48:32,095
Don't worry, we'll work out
something, like an instalment plan.

656
00:48:32,378 --> 00:48:35,746
<i>♪ I may never go home any more</i>

657
00:48:42,012 --> 00:48:44,902
I'm terribly sorry.
Now you have no ceiling.

658
00:48:45,141 --> 00:48:48,907
- Maybe I can fix it, I'm good at it.
- Why fix it? It's not raining.

659
00:48:49,186 --> 00:48:50,472
Ooh.

660
00:48:50,646 --> 00:48:53,616
- Are you all right?
- I think so. My head aches a little.

661
00:48:53,858 --> 00:48:56,065
Maybe I can fix it.

662
00:48:56,277 --> 00:48:58,245
I'm good at it.

663
00:49:04,452 --> 00:49:07,262
I had a weekend pass,
a month's pay in my pocket.

664
00:49:07,496 --> 00:49:11,182
- And she already had a wedding ring.
- Yes, that's right.

665
00:49:11,459 --> 00:49:14,622
We got married. When I got out
of the service I brought her here.

666
00:49:14,879 --> 00:49:18,600
It was wonderful. I rented
a little flat, Edgware Road.

667
00:49:18,883 --> 00:49:22,251
First time she saw it, she was so
happy she broke down and cried.

668
00:49:22,511 --> 00:49:27,039
Naturally. She had a solid roof over
her head and a British passport.

669
00:49:27,349 --> 00:49:32,719
You don't know her, how she feels about
me. You will when she gives evidence.

670
00:49:33,063 --> 00:49:37,785
Mr Vole, I must tell you I am not
putting her in the witness box.

671
00:49:38,944 --> 00:49:40,867
You're not? Why not?

672
00:49:41,071 --> 00:49:44,678
She's a foreigner, unfamiliar with
the subtleties of our language.

673
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:47,271
The prosecution could
easily trip her up.

674
00:49:47,495 --> 00:49:50,499
I hear it may be Mr Myers for the
crown. We can't take chances.

675
00:49:50,748 --> 00:49:54,798
Quite. We'd better be going. Miss Plimsoll
is waiting in the car with her pills

676
00:49:55,085 --> 00:49:58,453
- and a Thermos of lukewarm cocoa.
- Officer.

677
00:49:58,714 --> 00:50:03,197
- But Christine must give evidence.
- Mr Vole, you must learn to trust me.

678
00:50:03,511 --> 00:50:08,153
For no other reason than I'm a mean,
ill-tempered old man who hates to lose.

679
00:50:08,474 --> 00:50:11,045
Let us wish each other luck.

680
00:50:16,482 --> 00:50:22,046
Look, I can't face this without Christine.
I tell you, I need her. Without her I'm sunk.

681
00:50:23,614 --> 00:50:26,982
Touching, isn't it? The way
he counts on his wife.

682
00:50:27,243 --> 00:50:32,010
Yes. Like a drowning man
clutching at a razor blade.

683
00:50:47,555 --> 00:50:52,721
Leonard Stephen Vole, you are
charged on indictment for that you,

684
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:57,031
on the 14th day of October,
in the county of London,

685
00:50:57,314 --> 00:51:00,124
murdered Emily Jane French.

686
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:02,965
How say you, Leonard Stephen Vole?

687
00:51:03,195 --> 00:51:06,165
Are you guilty or not guilty?

688
00:51:08,451 --> 00:51:09,862
Not guilty.

689
00:51:11,871 --> 00:51:13,919
Members of the jury,

690
00:51:14,123 --> 00:51:18,731
the prisoner stands indicted for
that he, on the 14th day of October,

691
00:51:19,044 --> 00:51:21,809
murdered Emily Jane French.

692
00:51:22,047 --> 00:51:25,654
To this indictment he
has pleaded not guilty.

693
00:51:25,926 --> 00:51:29,567
And it is your charge to say,
having heard the evidence,

694
00:51:29,847 --> 00:51:32,737
whether he be guilty or not.

695
00:51:37,104 --> 00:51:40,347
Members of the jury, by the
oath which you have just taken,

696
00:51:40,608 --> 00:51:44,010
you have sworn to try this
case on the evidence.

697
00:51:44,278 --> 00:51:46,804
You must shut out from
your minds everything

698
00:51:47,031 --> 00:51:50,478
except what will take
place in this court.

699
00:51:50,743 --> 00:51:54,145
You may proceed for the
prosecution, Mr Myers.

700
00:51:54,413 --> 00:51:57,815
May it please you, my lord.
Members of the jury,

701
00:51:58,083 --> 00:52:02,645
I appear in this case with my learned
friend, Mr Barton, for the prosecution.

702
00:52:02,963 --> 00:52:06,729
And my learned friends Sir Wilfrid
Robarts and Mr Brogan-Moore

703
00:52:07,009 --> 00:52:08,977
appear for the defence.

704
00:52:13,057 --> 00:52:15,298
I trust we are not to be deprived

705
00:52:15,518 --> 00:52:18,328
of the learned and stimulating
presence of Sir Wilfrid?

706
00:52:18,562 --> 00:52:22,726
My lord, may I assure my learned friend
that Sir Wilfrid is in the Old Bailey.

707
00:52:23,025 --> 00:52:26,108
He's slightly incapacitated,
but will be in his seat presently.

708
00:52:26,362 --> 00:52:31,323
My lord, may I express my regret that Sir
Wilfrid is even slightly incapacitated.

709
00:52:31,659 --> 00:52:36,870
You may, Mr Myers. You may also proceed
with the case for the prosecution.

710
00:52:37,206 --> 00:52:39,368
Thank you, my lord.

711
00:52:39,583 --> 00:52:43,383
The facts in this case are simple
and, to a point, not in dispute.

712
00:52:43,671 --> 00:52:47,642
You will hear how the prisoner made
the acquaintance of Mrs Emily French,

713
00:52:47,925 --> 00:52:49,450
a woman of 56.

714
00:52:49,635 --> 00:52:53,879
How he was treated by her with
kindness and even affection.

715
00:52:54,181 --> 00:52:56,661
On the night of October 14 last,

716
00:52:56,892 --> 00:53:00,738
between 9:30 and 10,
Mrs French was murdered.

717
00:53:01,981 --> 00:53:04,427
Medical testimony will
be introduced to prove

718
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:07,859
that death was caused by a blow
from a blunt and heavy instrument,

719
00:53:08,112 --> 00:53:10,638
and it is the case
for the prosecution

720
00:53:10,865 --> 00:53:13,948
that the blow was dealt by
the prisoner, Leonard Vole.

721
00:53:14,201 --> 00:53:16,169
That's not true! I didn't do it!

722
00:53:18,914 --> 00:53:21,565
Among the witnesses,
you will hear police evidence,

723
00:53:21,792 --> 00:53:25,478
also the evidence of Mrs French's
housekeeper, Janet McKenzie,

724
00:53:25,754 --> 00:53:28,439
and from the medical and
laboratory experts,

725
00:53:28,674 --> 00:53:34,124
and the evidence of the murdered woman's
solicitor, who drew her final will.

726
00:53:34,472 --> 00:53:38,113
I now call Chief Inspector Hearne,
Criminal Investigation Department,

727
00:53:38,392 --> 00:53:41,123
- New Scotland Yard.
- Chief Inspector Hearne.

728
00:53:41,353 --> 00:53:44,323
- Chief Inspector Hearne.
- Chief Inspector Hearne.

729
00:54:02,374 --> 00:54:06,857
This is ridiculous. Just nervous heartburn.
I always get it the first day of a trial.

730
00:54:07,171 --> 00:54:09,742
240 above 130. You
shouldn't be here at all.

731
00:54:09,965 --> 00:54:12,969
- I should be in court, the trial's begun.
- Syringe, please.

732
00:54:13,219 --> 00:54:15,540
Be a good, brave boy, Sir Wilfrid.

733
00:54:15,763 --> 00:54:19,449
It may interest you to know that I
am descended from a warrior family

734
00:54:19,725 --> 00:54:24,891
which traces its brave past back
to Richard the Lion-Hearted.

735
00:54:27,483 --> 00:54:29,611
You're to have a calcium
injection daily,

736
00:54:29,819 --> 00:54:33,540
- tranquillising pill every hour.
- I'll set my wristwatch alarm.

737
00:54:33,823 --> 00:54:37,669
Any pain or shortness of breath, pop
one of these nitroglycerin tablets

738
00:54:37,952 --> 00:54:40,603
under your tongue. Oh, and
I'll leave you some...

739
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:44,915
That's enough, Doctor. The judge
will be asking for a saliva test.

740
00:54:45,209 --> 00:54:49,612
Carter, I'd better take that
Thermos of cocoa with me.

741
00:54:49,922 --> 00:54:52,653
- Helps me wash down the pills.
- Let me see it, please.

742
00:54:52,883 --> 00:54:58,049
My learned patient is not above
substituting brandy for cocoa.

743
00:54:58,389 --> 00:55:00,835
It is cocoa. So sorry.

744
00:55:01,058 --> 00:55:03,982
If you were a woman, Miss Plimsoll,
I would strike you.

745
00:55:04,228 --> 00:55:06,799
Take care of this, Carter.

746
00:55:08,566 --> 00:55:12,093
Now, Sir Wilfrid, in the courtroom,
you must avoid overexcitement.

747
00:55:12,361 --> 00:55:13,726
Yes, Doctor, yes, yes.

748
00:55:13,904 --> 00:55:16,510
Watch your temper. Keep
your blood pressure down.

749
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:21,109
Thank you, Doctor, I shall be quite safe,
what with the pills and the cocoa.

750
00:55:21,412 --> 00:55:23,380
Come along, Carter.

751
00:55:24,623 --> 00:55:27,513
From the body temperature
and other factors,

752
00:55:27,751 --> 00:55:31,358
we placed the time of death
at between 9:30 and 10pm,

753
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:36,921
approximately 30 minutes before Janet
McKenzie returned home and called us.

754
00:55:37,761 --> 00:55:43,165
Death was instantaneous, caused by one
blow from a heavy and blunt instrument.

755
00:55:43,517 --> 00:55:45,599
Were there any signs of a struggle?

756
00:55:45,811 --> 00:55:48,052
None. Just the one blow.

757
00:55:48,272 --> 00:55:52,072
Would that indicate that the murderer
had taken Mrs French by surprise?

758
00:55:52,359 --> 00:55:55,522
My lord, I must object.

759
00:55:56,489 --> 00:56:00,016
My learned friend refers to the
assailant as "the murderer".

760
00:56:00,284 --> 00:56:03,731
We have not yet determined whether
the assailant was a man or a woman.

761
00:56:03,996 --> 00:56:06,840
It could quite conceivably
have been "the murderess".

762
00:56:07,082 --> 00:56:12,805
Mr Myers, Sir Wilfrid has joined us just in
time to catch you on a point of grammar.

763
00:56:13,172 --> 00:56:15,254
Please rephrase your question.

764
00:56:15,466 --> 00:56:21,269
Yes, my lord. Inspector, is it
your opinion that the assailant,

765
00:56:21,639 --> 00:56:25,644
whether he, she or it, had
taken Mrs French by surprise?

766
00:56:25,935 --> 00:56:28,063
My lord, I am taken by surprise

767
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:32,958
that my learned friend should try to solicit
from the witness an opinion, not a fact.

768
00:56:33,275 --> 00:56:36,085
Quite so. You'll have to do
better than that, Mr Myers.

769
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,561
My lord, I withdraw the
question entirely.

770
00:56:38,781 --> 00:56:41,352
- Is that better?
- That's much better.

771
00:56:47,289 --> 00:56:49,098
Silence! Silence!

772
00:56:52,461 --> 00:56:55,271
Very well, Inspector, let
us proceed with the facts.

773
00:56:55,506 --> 00:56:59,750
After establishing the cause and the
time of death, what did you then do?

774
00:57:00,052 --> 00:57:03,738
A search was made, photographs were
taken and the premises fingerprinted.

775
00:57:04,014 --> 00:57:08,019
- What fingerprints did you discover?
- I found the fingerprints of Mrs French,

776
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:12,599
those of Janet McKenzie, and some which
later proved to be those of Leonard Vole.

777
00:57:12,898 --> 00:57:15,026
- No others?
- No others.

778
00:57:15,234 --> 00:57:19,842
Did you say the room had the appearance
that a robbery had been committed?

779
00:57:20,156 --> 00:57:25,322
Yes. Things were strewn about and the
window had been broken near the catch.

780
00:57:25,661 --> 00:57:29,507
There was glass on the floor,
and fragments were found outside.

781
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:35,035
The glass outside was not consistent with
the window being forced from the outside.

782
00:57:35,379 --> 00:57:41,830
You're saying that someone made it look as
if it had been forced from the outside?

783
00:57:42,219 --> 00:57:46,429
My lord, I must object. My learned friend
is putting words in the witness' mouth.

784
00:57:46,724 --> 00:57:49,534
After all, if he insists on
answering his own questions,

785
00:57:49,768 --> 00:57:53,056
the presence of the witness
would seem superfluous.

786
00:57:53,314 --> 00:57:55,681
Quite. Don't you
think so, Mr Myers?

787
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,868
Yes, my lord.

788
00:57:59,069 --> 00:58:00,434
Inspector,

789
00:58:00,613 --> 00:58:04,095
did you ascertain if any of the
murdered woman's property was missing?

790
00:58:04,366 --> 00:58:07,336
According to the housekeeper,
nothing was missing.

791
00:58:07,578 --> 00:58:12,982
In your experience, Inspector,
when burglars or burglaresses

792
00:58:13,334 --> 00:58:17,100
break into a house, do they
leave without taking anything?

793
00:58:17,379 --> 00:58:18,460
No, sir.

794
00:58:18,631 --> 00:58:21,441
- Do you produce a jacket, Inspector?
- Yes, sir.

795
00:58:21,675 --> 00:58:23,837
Is that the jacket?

796
00:58:27,139 --> 00:58:30,825
- Yes, sir.
- That is exhibit P1, my lord.

797
00:58:31,101 --> 00:58:33,069
Where did you find this, Inspector?

798
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:35,750
That is the jacket found
in the prisoner's flat,

799
00:58:35,981 --> 00:58:38,382
which I handed to our lab
to test for bloodstains.

800
00:58:38,609 --> 00:58:40,976
- And did you find any bloodstains?
- Yes.

801
00:58:41,195 --> 00:58:43,675
Though an attempt had been
made to wash them out.

802
00:58:43,906 --> 00:58:45,715
What tests were made?

803
00:58:45,908 --> 00:58:49,958
First to determine if the
stains were human blood,

804
00:58:50,246 --> 00:58:52,567
then to classify it
by group or type.

805
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:55,361
And was the blood of a
particular group or type?

806
00:58:55,584 --> 00:58:58,394
Yes, sir. It is type O.

807
00:58:58,629 --> 00:59:01,792
And did you subsequently test
the blood of the dead woman?

808
00:59:02,049 --> 00:59:04,290
- Yes, sir.
- What type was that?

809
00:59:05,803 --> 00:59:08,124
The same. Type O.

810
00:59:08,347 --> 00:59:11,988
Thank you, Inspector.
No further questions.

811
00:59:12,268 --> 00:59:17,115
Inspector, you say the only fingerprints
you found were those of Mrs French,

812
00:59:17,439 --> 00:59:19,760
Janet McKenzie and Leonard Vole.

813
00:59:19,984 --> 00:59:24,751
In your experience, when a burglar breaks
in, does he usually leave fingerprints

814
00:59:25,072 --> 00:59:27,359
- or does he wear gloves?
- He wears gloves.

815
00:59:27,575 --> 00:59:29,816
So the absence of
fingerprints in a robbery

816
00:59:30,035 --> 00:59:32,163
- would hardly surprise you?
- No, sir.

817
00:59:32,371 --> 00:59:36,217
Can't we surmise the burglar might
have entered a presumably empty house,

818
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:39,106
suddenly encountered Mrs
French and struck her,

819
00:59:39,336 --> 00:59:42,545
then, realising she was dead,
fled without taking anything?

820
00:59:42,798 --> 00:59:45,278
I submit, my lord, that
it is entirely impossible

821
00:59:45,509 --> 00:59:49,912
to guess what went on in the mind
of some entirely imaginary burglar.

822
00:59:50,222 --> 00:59:52,384
With or without gloves.

823
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:56,366
Let us not surmise, Sir Wilfrid,
but confine ourselves to facts.

824
00:59:58,856 --> 01:00:02,941
Inspector, when you questioned the
prisoner as to the stains on his jacket,

825
01:00:03,235 --> 01:00:07,126
did he not show you a
recently-healed scar on his wrist,

826
01:00:07,406 --> 01:00:11,968
- saying he had cut himself slicing bread?
- Yes, sir, that is what he said.

827
01:00:12,286 --> 01:00:14,937
And were you not told the
same thing by his wife?

828
01:00:15,164 --> 01:00:18,885
- Yes, sir. But afterwards...
- Just a simple yes or no, please.

829
01:00:19,168 --> 01:00:21,455
Did the prisoner's
wife show you a knife

830
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:25,561
and tell you that her husband had
cut his wrist while slicing bread?

831
01:00:25,841 --> 01:00:30,290
- Yes, sir.
- I will ask you to examine this knife.

832
01:00:34,683 --> 01:00:38,210
Just test the edge of it
with your finger. Carefully!

833
01:00:38,479 --> 01:00:42,325
You agree that the point and the
cutting edge are razor-sharp?

834
01:00:42,608 --> 01:00:44,975
- Yes, sir.
- Now, if such a knife were to slip,

835
01:00:45,194 --> 01:00:48,118
might it not inflict a cut
that would bleed profusely?

836
01:00:48,364 --> 01:00:49,525
Yes, sir, it might.

837
01:00:49,698 --> 01:00:54,625
Inspector, you stated that the bloodstains
on the prisoner's jacket were analysed,

838
01:00:54,954 --> 01:00:59,721
as was the blood of Mrs French, and
they were both found to be of group O.

839
01:01:00,042 --> 01:01:02,409
- That is correct.
- However,

840
01:01:02,628 --> 01:01:05,950
if the prisoner's blood were
also of this same group,

841
01:01:06,215 --> 01:01:08,821
then the stains on his jacket
may well have resulted

842
01:01:09,051 --> 01:01:11,657
from the household accident
he described to you.

843
01:01:11,887 --> 01:01:14,208
Yes, sir.

844
01:01:14,431 --> 01:01:18,072
Did you examine the
prisoner's blood, Inspector?

845
01:01:18,352 --> 01:01:19,842
No, sir.

846
01:01:21,605 --> 01:01:24,370
I have here a certificate

847
01:01:24,608 --> 01:01:28,738
stating that Leonard Stephen
Vole is a blood donor

848
01:01:29,029 --> 01:01:31,236
at the North London Hospital.

849
01:01:31,449 --> 01:01:34,737
And that his blood is group O.

850
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:41,907
Thank you, Inspector.

851
01:01:44,962 --> 01:01:49,490
Inspector, granted that the cut on
the wrist was caused by that knife,

852
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:52,770
is there anything to show
whether it was an accident

853
01:01:53,012 --> 01:01:56,937
or done deliberately after the murder
to account for the bloodstains?

854
01:01:57,224 --> 01:01:59,909
- Oh, really, my lord!
- I withdraw the question.

855
01:02:00,144 --> 01:02:01,509
You may stand down.

856
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:07,330
- Call Janet McKenzie.
- Janet McKenzie.

857
01:02:07,568 --> 01:02:10,333
- Janet McKenzie.
- Janet McKenzie.

858
01:02:33,761 --> 01:02:36,446
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence...

859
01:02:39,058 --> 01:02:42,301
...the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

860
01:02:42,561 --> 01:02:45,644
Carter. Carter. Pill. Pill.

861
01:02:45,898 --> 01:02:49,266
- Your name is Janet McKenzie?
- Aye, that's my name.

862
01:02:49,527 --> 01:02:54,328
- When did you first come to London?
- That was many years ago. 28 years ago.

863
01:02:54,657 --> 01:02:58,981
- Where do you live?
- Now that Mrs French, poor soul, is dead,

864
01:02:59,286 --> 01:03:02,893
I've moved in with my niece
at 19 Glenister Road.

865
01:03:03,165 --> 01:03:06,294
You were companion-housekeeper
to the late Mrs Emily French?

866
01:03:06,544 --> 01:03:09,593
I was her housekeeper!
I've no opinion of companions,

867
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:13,002
poor feckless bodies, afraid of
a bit of honest domestic work.

868
01:03:13,259 --> 01:03:18,265
I meant you were on friendly terms, not
altogether those of mistress and servant.

869
01:03:18,597 --> 01:03:21,601
Aye. Ten years I was with
her and looked after her.

870
01:03:21,851 --> 01:03:24,422
She knew me and she trusted me.

871
01:03:24,645 --> 01:03:27,410
Many's the time I prevented
her doing a foolish thing.

872
01:03:27,648 --> 01:03:32,336
Please tell us, in your own words, about
the events of the evening of October 14.

873
01:03:33,237 --> 01:03:37,128
It was a Friday and my night out. I was
going to see my niece at Glenister Road,

874
01:03:37,408 --> 01:03:41,697
which is about five minutes' walk.
I left the house at half past seven.

875
01:03:41,996 --> 01:03:46,081
I promised to take her a dress
pattern that she admired.

876
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:49,857
- Och, is this thing necessary?
- An excellent question.

877
01:03:50,129 --> 01:03:54,373
However, it has been installed at
considerable expense to the taxpayers,

878
01:03:54,675 --> 01:03:58,202
so let us take advantage of it.
Please continue.

879
01:03:58,471 --> 01:04:02,112
Well, when I got to my niece's,
I found I'd left the pattern behind.

880
01:04:02,391 --> 01:04:05,679
So after supper I slipped back
to get it as it was no distance.

881
01:04:05,936 --> 01:04:09,099
I got back to the
house at 25 past 9.

882
01:04:09,356 --> 01:04:11,597
I let myself in and went
upstairs to my room.

883
01:04:11,817 --> 01:04:16,823
As I passed the sitting room, I heard the
prisoner in there, talking to Mrs French.

884
01:04:17,156 --> 01:04:21,127
No, it wasn't me!
It wasn't my voice!

885
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:23,378
Talking and laughing they were.

886
01:04:23,579 --> 01:04:26,981
But it was no business of mine, so I
went upstairs to fetch my pattern.

887
01:04:27,249 --> 01:04:30,537
Now, let us be very
exact as to the time.

888
01:04:30,795 --> 01:04:34,561
You say that you re-entered
the house at 25 past 9?

889
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:39,084
Aye. The pattern was on a shelf in my
room next to my clock so I saw the time.

890
01:04:39,386 --> 01:04:43,675
- And it was 25 past 9.
- Go on, please.

891
01:04:43,974 --> 01:04:49,743
I went back to my niece. Och, she was
delighted with the pattern. Si...

892
01:04:51,857 --> 01:04:57,944
Simply delighted. I stayed until 20 to 11,
then I said good night and I come home.

893
01:04:58,322 --> 01:05:01,963
I went into the sitting room to see
if the mistress wanted anything

894
01:05:02,243 --> 01:05:04,211
before she went to bed.

895
01:05:04,411 --> 01:05:08,780
And there she was, dead. And
everything tossed hither and thither.

896
01:05:09,083 --> 01:05:11,893
Did you really think that a
burglary had been committed?

897
01:05:12,128 --> 01:05:14,096
My lord, I must protest!

898
01:05:14,296 --> 01:05:18,301
I will not allow that question
to be answered, Mr Myers.

899
01:05:18,592 --> 01:05:22,358
Miss McKenzie, were you aware that
Leonard Vole was a married man?

900
01:05:22,638 --> 01:05:25,403
No, indeed. And neither
was the mistress.

901
01:05:25,641 --> 01:05:27,609
- Janet!
- My lord, I must object.

902
01:05:27,810 --> 01:05:32,577
What Mrs French knew or did not know is
pure conjecture on Janet McKenzie's part.

903
01:05:34,275 --> 01:05:36,562
Let me put it this way.
You formed the opinion

904
01:05:36,777 --> 01:05:40,145
that Mrs French thought Leonard
Vole was a single man?

905
01:05:40,406 --> 01:05:43,774
- Have you any facts to support this?
- The books that she ordered.

906
01:05:44,034 --> 01:05:48,722
A life of the Baroness Burdett-Coutts,
and the one about Disraeli and his wife.

907
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:52,930
Both of them about women that married
men years younger than themselves. Oh!

908
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:56,737
- I knew what she was thinking.
- I'm afraid we cannot admit that.

909
01:05:57,006 --> 01:05:59,532
Why?

910
01:05:59,758 --> 01:06:04,764
Members of the jury, it is possible for
a woman to read The Life of Disraeli

911
01:06:05,097 --> 01:06:09,068
without contemplating marriage
with a man younger than herself.

912
01:06:11,645 --> 01:06:16,776
Were you aware of the arrangements Mrs
French made to dispose of her money?

913
01:06:17,109 --> 01:06:20,477
She had her old will revoked
and a new one drawn up.

914
01:06:20,738 --> 01:06:23,059
I heard her calling Mr Stokes,
her solicitor.

915
01:06:23,282 --> 01:06:26,126
He was there at the time.
The prisoner, I mean.

916
01:06:26,744 --> 01:06:30,066
You heard Mrs French and the
prisoner discussing her new will?

917
01:06:30,331 --> 01:06:33,062
Yes. He was to have all
her money, she told him,

918
01:06:33,292 --> 01:06:37,536
as she had no near relations nor
anybody that meant to her what he did.

919
01:06:37,838 --> 01:06:41,126
- When did this take place?
- On October 8.

920
01:06:41,383 --> 01:06:44,546
One week to the day
before she was murdered.

921
01:06:44,804 --> 01:06:47,933
Thank you. That concludes
my examination.

922
01:06:48,974 --> 01:06:51,545
Not just yet, Miss McKenzie.

923
01:06:52,728 --> 01:06:55,777
Would you...? Thank you.

924
01:06:56,023 --> 01:07:00,233
Miss McKenzie, you have given
evidence about two wills.

925
01:07:00,528 --> 01:07:02,496
In the old will, that
which was revoked,

926
01:07:02,696 --> 01:07:06,382
were you not to receive the
bulk of Mrs French's estate?

927
01:07:06,659 --> 01:07:07,820
That's so.

928
01:07:07,993 --> 01:07:12,123
Whereas in the new will, except for a
bequest to you of a small annuity,

929
01:07:12,414 --> 01:07:15,941
the principal beneficiary is
the prisoner, Leonard Vole.

930
01:07:16,210 --> 01:07:19,851
It'll be a wicked injustice if he
ever touches a penny of that money.

931
01:07:20,131 --> 01:07:24,295
It is entirely understandable that you
are antagonistic to the prisoner.

932
01:07:24,593 --> 01:07:27,073
I'm not antagonistic to him.

933
01:07:27,304 --> 01:07:31,150
He's a shiftless, scheming rascal.
But I'm not antagonistic to him.

934
01:07:32,351 --> 01:07:34,319
I suggest you formed this opinion

935
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:38,161
because his friendship with Mrs French
cost you the bulk of her estate.

936
01:07:38,441 --> 01:07:42,446
- I've never liked him.
- Your candour is refreshing.

937
01:07:42,736 --> 01:07:45,342
Now. On the night of October 14

938
01:07:45,573 --> 01:07:48,736
you say you heard the prisoner
and Mrs French talking together.

939
01:07:48,993 --> 01:07:52,315
- What did you hear them say?
- I didn't hear what they actually said.

940
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:55,026
You mean you only heard the voices?

941
01:07:55,249 --> 01:07:57,980
- The murmur of voices?
- They were laughing.

942
01:07:58,210 --> 01:08:01,214
What makes you say the man's
voice was Leonard Vole's?

943
01:08:01,464 --> 01:08:05,674
- I know his voice well enough.
- The door was closed, was it not?

944
01:08:05,968 --> 01:08:09,290
- Aye, that's so.
- You were in a hurry to get the pattern

945
01:08:09,555 --> 01:08:12,365
so you probably walked quickly
past the closed door,

946
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:15,206
yet you are sure you heard
Leonard Vole's voice?

947
01:08:15,436 --> 01:08:18,121
I was there long enough
to hear what I heard.

948
01:08:18,355 --> 01:08:24,317
Come, I'm sure you don't wish to suggest
to the jury that you were eavesdropping.

949
01:08:24,695 --> 01:08:27,141
It was him in there.
Who else could it have been?

950
01:08:27,364 --> 01:08:31,494
What you mean is that you wanted it to
be him. That's the way your mind worked.

951
01:08:31,786 --> 01:08:35,711
Now, tell me, did Mrs French sometimes
watch television in the evening?

952
01:08:35,998 --> 01:08:38,888
Yes. She was fond of a
talk or a good play.

953
01:08:39,126 --> 01:08:42,255
Wasn't it possible when you
returned home and passed the door,

954
01:08:42,505 --> 01:08:44,587
what you really heard
was the television

955
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:47,279
and a man and woman's
voices and laughter?

956
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:51,799
There was a play called Lover's
Leap on the television that night.

957
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:57,384
- It was not the television.
- Oh, why not?

958
01:08:57,686 --> 01:09:02,533
Because the television was away being
repaired that week, that's why.

959
01:09:13,369 --> 01:09:15,178
Silence! Silence!

960
01:09:16,956 --> 01:09:19,960
Odd. It's not time yet.

961
01:09:20,209 --> 01:09:23,133
If my learned friend has no
further questions, I'd like...

962
01:09:23,379 --> 01:09:26,349
I have not quite finished.

963
01:09:26,590 --> 01:09:31,039
You are registered, are you not, under
the National Health Insurance Act?

964
01:09:31,345 --> 01:09:34,952
Aye, that's so. Four and
sixpence I pay out every week.

965
01:09:35,224 --> 01:09:38,148
That's a terrible lot of money
for a working woman to pay.

966
01:09:38,394 --> 01:09:41,204
I am sure that many agree with you.

967
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:47,606
Miss McKenzie, did you recently apply
to the National Health Insurance for...

968
01:09:47,987 --> 01:09:51,469
- ...a hearing aid?
- For... for what?

969
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:54,630
I protest against the way in
which this question was put!

970
01:09:54,869 --> 01:09:57,839
I will repeat the
question, my lord.

971
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:03,803
I asked you in a normal tone of voice,
audible to everyone in open court,

972
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:08,858
did you apply to the National
Health Insurance for a hearing aid?

973
01:10:09,175 --> 01:10:10,176
Yes, I did.

974
01:10:10,342 --> 01:10:12,663
- Did you get it?
- Not yet.

975
01:10:12,887 --> 01:10:17,973
However, you state that you walked past
a door, which is four inches of solid oak,

976
01:10:18,309 --> 01:10:21,392
you heard voices,
and you are willing to swear

977
01:10:21,645 --> 01:10:24,615
that you could distinguish
the voice of...

978
01:10:24,857 --> 01:10:26,985
...the prisoner, Leonard Vole.

979
01:10:27,193 --> 01:10:29,161
Who? Who?

980
01:10:30,446 --> 01:10:32,414
No further questions.

981
01:10:34,867 --> 01:10:37,154
Och, maybe you could
help me, Your Lordship.

982
01:10:37,369 --> 01:10:41,294
Six months ago I applied for my hearing
aid, and I'm still waiting for it.

983
01:10:41,582 --> 01:10:46,349
My dear Miss McKenzie, considering the
rubbish that is being talked nowadays,

984
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:49,514
you are missing very little.
You may stand down now.

985
01:10:52,301 --> 01:10:55,430
Call Police Constable Jeffries.

986
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:59,809
- Police Constable Jeffries.
- Police Constable Jeffries.

987
01:11:10,528 --> 01:11:13,259
I swear by Almighty God that
the evidence I shall give

988
01:11:13,489 --> 01:11:18,370
shall be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth.

989
01:11:31,841 --> 01:11:34,606
Mr Myers, does that
conclude your case?

990
01:11:34,844 --> 01:11:39,645
No, my lord. I now call the final witness
for the prosecution, Christine Helm.

991
01:11:40,349 --> 01:11:43,637
- Christine Helm!
- Christine Helm.

992
01:11:55,406 --> 01:11:57,374
Christine.

993
01:12:08,294 --> 01:12:10,900
I swear by Almighty God that
the evidence I shall give

994
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:14,612
shall be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth.

995
01:12:14,884 --> 01:12:17,410
My lord, I have the
most serious objection

996
01:12:17,636 --> 01:12:21,561
to this witness being summoned,
as she is the wife of the prisoner.

997
01:12:21,849 --> 01:12:23,851
I call my learned
friend's attention

998
01:12:24,059 --> 01:12:28,428
to the fact that I summoned
not Mrs Vole, but Mrs Helm.

999
01:12:28,731 --> 01:12:32,656
- Your name, in fact, is Christine Helm?
- Yes. Christine Helm.

1000
01:12:32,943 --> 01:12:36,425
And you have been living as the
wife of the prisoner, Leonard Vole?

1001
01:12:36,697 --> 01:12:39,268
- Yes.
- Are you actually his wife?

1002
01:12:39,909 --> 01:12:41,399
No.

1003
01:12:41,577 --> 01:12:45,901
I went through a marriage ceremony
with him, but I already had a husband.

1004
01:12:46,207 --> 01:12:48,733
- He's still alive.
- Christine, that's not true!

1005
01:12:48,959 --> 01:12:52,281
There is proof of a marriage between
the witness and the prisoner,

1006
01:12:52,546 --> 01:12:55,390
but is there any proof of a
so-called previous marriage?

1007
01:12:55,633 --> 01:13:01,037
My lord, the so-called previous
marriage is, in fact, well-documented.

1008
01:13:01,388 --> 01:13:07,157
Mrs Helm, is this a certificate of marriage
between yourself and Otto Ludwig Helm,

1009
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:12,048
the ceremony having taken place
in Breslau on 18 April 1942?

1010
01:13:12,358 --> 01:13:15,089
Yes, that is the paper
of my marriage.

1011
01:13:15,319 --> 01:13:21,008
I don't see any reason why this witness
should not be qualified to give evidence.

1012
01:13:25,454 --> 01:13:29,823
You're willing to give evidence against
the man you've been calling your husband?

1013
01:13:30,126 --> 01:13:31,537
Yes.

1014
01:13:32,253 --> 01:13:35,860
You stated to the police that on the
night that Mrs French was murdered,

1015
01:13:36,132 --> 01:13:41,172
Leonard Vole left the house at 7:30
and returned at 25 minutes past 9.

1016
01:13:41,512 --> 01:13:44,038
Did he, in fact,
return at 25 past 9?

1017
01:13:45,808 --> 01:13:48,857
No. He returned at ten
minutes past ten.

1018
01:13:49,103 --> 01:13:53,586
Christine, what are you saying?
It's not true. You know it's not true!

1019
01:13:57,361 --> 01:13:59,409
Silence!

1020
01:13:59,613 --> 01:14:01,581
I must have silence.

1021
01:14:03,075 --> 01:14:05,965
As your counsel will tell you,
Vole, you will very shortly

1022
01:14:06,203 --> 01:14:09,047
have an opportunity of
speaking in your own defence.

1023
01:14:09,290 --> 01:14:13,261
Leonard Vole returned, you say,
at ten minutes past ten.

1024
01:14:13,544 --> 01:14:16,946
- And what happened next?
- He was breathing hard, very excited.

1025
01:14:17,214 --> 01:14:19,820
He threw off his coat and
examined the sleeves.

1026
01:14:20,050 --> 01:14:22,178
Then he told me to wash the cuffs.

1027
01:14:22,386 --> 01:14:24,468
- They had blood on them.
- Go on.

1028
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:27,570
- I said "What have you done?"
- What did the prisoner say?

1029
01:14:27,808 --> 01:14:29,970
He said "I've killed her."

1030
01:14:30,186 --> 01:14:34,510
Christine! Why are you lying?
Why are you saying these things?

1031
01:14:34,815 --> 01:14:38,820
- What an awful woman.
- She's evil. I've known it all along.

1032
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:45,561
If the defence so desires,
I will adjourn for a short time

1033
01:14:45,826 --> 01:14:48,875
so that the prisoner may
gain control of himself.

1034
01:14:49,121 --> 01:14:52,728
My lord is most gracious, but
pray let the witness continue.

1035
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:57,085
We are all of us caught up in the
suspense of this horror fiction.

1036
01:14:57,379 --> 01:15:01,100
To have to hear it in instalments
might prove unendurable.

1037
01:15:01,383 --> 01:15:04,193
- Proceed, Mr Myers.
- Mrs Helm,

1038
01:15:04,428 --> 01:15:09,036
when the prisoner said "I have killed her",
did you know to whom he referred?

1039
01:15:09,350 --> 01:15:12,081
It was that woman he had
been seeing so often.

1040
01:15:12,311 --> 01:15:16,873
When questioned by the police, you told
them that the prisoner returned at 9.25.

1041
01:15:17,191 --> 01:15:19,478
Yes. Because Leonard
asked me to say that.

1042
01:15:19,693 --> 01:15:21,695
But you've changed
your story now. Why?

1043
01:15:21,904 --> 01:15:24,032
I cannot go on lying to save him.

1044
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:27,449
I said to the police what he wanted
because I'm grateful to him.

1045
01:15:27,701 --> 01:15:30,352
He married me and brought
me to this country.

1046
01:15:30,579 --> 01:15:33,503
What he has asked me to do I
have because I was grateful.

1047
01:15:33,749 --> 01:15:36,673
It was not because he was your
husband and you loved him?

1048
01:15:36,919 --> 01:15:38,887
I never loved him.

1049
01:15:39,463 --> 01:15:42,512
It was gratitude, then, that
prompted you to give him an alibi

1050
01:15:42,758 --> 01:15:46,126
- in your statement to the police?
- That is it. Exactly.

1051
01:15:46,387 --> 01:15:49,789
- But now you think it was wrong to do so.
- Because it is murder.

1052
01:15:50,057 --> 01:15:52,105
That woman, she was a
harmless old fool,

1053
01:15:52,309 --> 01:15:54,755
and he makes of me an
accomplice to the murder.

1054
01:15:54,979 --> 01:15:58,825
I cannot come into court and swear that
he was with me at the time it was done.

1055
01:15:59,108 --> 01:16:01,679
I cannot do it! I cannot do it!

1056
01:16:01,902 --> 01:16:04,064
Then this is the truth?

1057
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:07,682
That Leonard Vole returned that
night at ten minutes past ten,

1058
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:09,952
he had blood on the
sleeves of his coat,

1059
01:16:10,161 --> 01:16:14,132
and that he said to you
"I have killed her"?

1060
01:16:15,958 --> 01:16:17,642
That is the truth.

1061
01:16:17,835 --> 01:16:20,884
That is the truth, before God?

1062
01:16:21,130 --> 01:16:23,178
That is the truth.

1063
01:16:23,757 --> 01:16:25,725
Thank you.

1064
01:16:31,015 --> 01:16:34,417
Mrs Vole, or Mrs Helm, which
do you prefer to be called?

1065
01:16:34,685 --> 01:16:36,653
- It does not matter.
- Does it not?

1066
01:16:36,854 --> 01:16:40,745
In this country we are inclined to take
a rather more serious view of marriage.

1067
01:16:41,025 --> 01:16:46,031
However, it would appear that when you
first met the prisoner in Hamburg

1068
01:16:46,363 --> 01:16:50,687
- you lied to him about your marital status.
- I wanted to get out of Germany, so...

1069
01:16:50,993 --> 01:16:53,963
You lied, did you not?
Just yes or no, please.

1070
01:16:54,205 --> 01:16:56,173
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1071
01:16:56,373 --> 01:16:59,343
And in arranging the marriage,
you lied to the authorities?

1072
01:16:59,585 --> 01:17:02,395
I, um, did not tell the
truth to the authorities.

1073
01:17:02,630 --> 01:17:04,792
- You lied to them?
- Yes.

1074
01:17:05,007 --> 01:17:09,217
And in the ceremony, when you swore to
love, honour and cherish your husband,

1075
01:17:09,512 --> 01:17:11,913
- that too was a lie?
- Yes.

1076
01:17:12,139 --> 01:17:15,268
And when the police questioned
you about this wretched man

1077
01:17:15,518 --> 01:17:17,839
who believed himself
married and loved,

1078
01:17:18,062 --> 01:17:20,463
- you told them...
- I told them what he wanted me to.

1079
01:17:20,689 --> 01:17:24,375
You told them that he was at home
with you at 25 minutes past 9,

1080
01:17:24,652 --> 01:17:28,782
- and now you say that that was a lie?
- Yes, a lie!

1081
01:17:29,073 --> 01:17:33,283
And when you said that he had accidentally
cut his wrist, again, you lied?

1082
01:17:33,577 --> 01:17:38,265
- Yes!
- And today you told a new story entirely.

1083
01:17:38,582 --> 01:17:41,984
The question is, Frau Helm, were
you lying then, are you lying now?

1084
01:17:42,253 --> 01:17:45,860
Or are you not, in fact,
a chronic and habitual liar?!

1085
01:17:49,677 --> 01:17:53,841
Carter, Carter! The other
pill. Under the tongue.

1086
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:58,304
My lord, is my learned friend to be
allowed to bully and insult the witness?

1087
01:17:58,602 --> 01:18:02,652
Mr Myers, this is a capital charge
and, within the bounds of reason,

1088
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:06,911
I should like the defence
to have every latitude.

1089
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:12,719
My lord, may I also
remind my learned friend

1090
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:16,716
that his witness, by her own admission,
has already violated so many oaths

1091
01:18:16,996 --> 01:18:20,762
that I am surprised the Testament
did not leap from her hand

1092
01:18:21,041 --> 01:18:23,612
when she was sworn here today.

1093
01:18:23,836 --> 01:18:27,966
I doubt if anything is to be gained
by questioning you any further.

1094
01:18:28,257 --> 01:18:30,305
That will be all, Frau Helm.

1095
01:18:35,347 --> 01:18:39,636
Mrs Helm, I presume you know the
meaning of the English word "perjury"?

1096
01:18:39,935 --> 01:18:43,417
- In German, the word is Meineid.
- Yes. Meineid.

1097
01:18:43,689 --> 01:18:45,691
It means to swear
falsely under oath.

1098
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:47,629
And are you aware, Mrs Helm,

1099
01:18:47,818 --> 01:18:52,585
that the penalty in this country for
perjury is a heavy term of imprisonment?

1100
01:18:52,907 --> 01:18:55,274
Yes, I'm aware.

1101
01:18:55,493 --> 01:19:00,055
Mindful of this fact, I ask you once more,
is the evidence that you have given

1102
01:19:00,372 --> 01:19:03,854
the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1103
01:19:04,126 --> 01:19:06,015
So help me, God.

1104
01:19:07,254 --> 01:19:11,498
Then that, my lord, is the
case for the prosecution.

1105
01:19:29,443 --> 01:19:33,129
- Want a tissue?
- Yes, thanks.

1106
01:19:33,405 --> 01:19:37,933
It's the first murder trial
I've ever been to. It's terrible.

1107
01:19:38,244 --> 01:19:39,166
Silence.

1108
01:19:41,455 --> 01:19:45,016
Sir Wilfrid. Are you
ready for the defence?

1109
01:19:47,336 --> 01:19:50,977
My lord, members of the jury,

1110
01:19:51,257 --> 01:19:56,218
the prosecution has very ably presented
against the prisoner, Leonard Vole,

1111
01:19:56,554 --> 01:20:00,764
a case with the most overwhelming
circumstantial evidence.

1112
01:20:01,058 --> 01:20:04,460
Among the witnesses you have
heard Chief Inspector Hearne,

1113
01:20:04,728 --> 01:20:09,609
who has given his testimony in a fair and
impartial manner, as he always does.

1114
01:20:09,942 --> 01:20:14,664
He has put before you a clever theory
of how this crime was committed.

1115
01:20:14,989 --> 01:20:18,789
Whether it is theory or
actual fact, however,

1116
01:20:19,076 --> 01:20:21,522
you will decide for yourselves.

1117
01:20:22,663 --> 01:20:25,667
And then you have heard the
evidence of Janet McKenzie,

1118
01:20:25,916 --> 01:20:29,921
a worthy and devoted housekeeper who
has suffered two most grievous losses.

1119
01:20:30,212 --> 01:20:32,453
One, the death of her
beloved mistress

1120
01:20:32,673 --> 01:20:38,123
and, second, in being deprived
of an inheritance of £80,000,

1121
01:20:38,471 --> 01:20:41,156
which she'd fully
expected to receive.

1122
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:45,076
I will not comment
further on her evidence,

1123
01:20:46,270 --> 01:20:50,116
but will express only my
deepest sympathy for her

1124
01:20:50,399 --> 01:20:53,164
in both these... mishaps.

1125
01:20:54,236 --> 01:20:59,720
And most damaging of all, the prosecution
has produced a surprise witness,

1126
01:21:00,075 --> 01:21:04,558
one Christine Helm, whom the prisoner
brought from the rubble of her homeland

1127
01:21:04,872 --> 01:21:09,400
to the safety of this country, giving her
his love and the protection of his name.

1128
01:21:09,710 --> 01:21:13,317
I objected to her testimony because
a wife cannot give evidence

1129
01:21:13,589 --> 01:21:15,990
harmful to her husband.

1130
01:21:16,217 --> 01:21:22,623
But it has been proven that her marriage
to Mr Vole was fraudulent and bigamous.

1131
01:21:23,015 --> 01:21:28,943
Therefore, her evidence must be
admitted and you must consider it.

1132
01:21:29,313 --> 01:21:32,078
For what it is worth.

1133
01:21:33,818 --> 01:21:38,062
Such is the prosecution's case.
Now it is the tum of the defence.

1134
01:21:38,364 --> 01:21:42,289
We could present, on behalf of the
prisoner, witnesses to his character,

1135
01:21:42,576 --> 01:21:46,376
his war record, the lack of criminal
or evil association in his past.

1136
01:21:46,664 --> 01:21:52,148
However, only one witness
can shed new light

1137
01:21:52,503 --> 01:21:55,268
on this tragic riddle.

1138
01:21:56,465 --> 01:21:58,433
The prisoner himself.

1139
01:21:59,969 --> 01:22:02,051
Members of the jury,

1140
01:22:02,263 --> 01:22:05,710
I call Leonard Stephen Vole.

1141
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:28,328
I swear by Almighty God that the
evidence I give will be the truth,

1142
01:22:28,581 --> 01:22:31,630
- the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
- No.

1143
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:36,965
- Is your name Leonard Stephen Vole?
- It is.

1144
01:22:37,256 --> 01:22:40,226
- Where do live?
- 620 Edgware Road.

1145
01:22:40,468 --> 01:22:45,554
Leonard Stephen Vole, did you or did you
not on the night of October 14 last,

1146
01:22:45,890 --> 01:22:48,052
murder Emily Jane French?

1147
01:22:48,726 --> 01:22:52,492
- I did not.
- Thank you, that will be all.

1148
01:22:54,815 --> 01:22:59,104
Have you, in fact, concluded your
examination of the prisoner, Sir Wilfrid?

1149
01:22:59,403 --> 01:23:04,489
The prisoner has endured three days
of profound mental agony and shock.

1150
01:23:04,825 --> 01:23:07,226
The defence feels his
faculties should be spared

1151
01:23:07,453 --> 01:23:10,900
for the cross-examination by my
learned friend for the prosecution.

1152
01:23:11,165 --> 01:23:13,930
This is not a plea
for any indulgence.

1153
01:23:14,168 --> 01:23:17,092
I am confident that no matter
how searching this may be,

1154
01:23:17,338 --> 01:23:20,103
the prisoner will withstand it.

1155
01:23:21,717 --> 01:23:25,244
At the time you made the acquaintance
of Mrs French, were you employed?

1156
01:23:25,513 --> 01:23:27,481
- No, sir.
- How much money did you have?

1157
01:23:27,681 --> 01:23:29,683
- A few pounds.
- Did she give you any?

1158
01:23:29,892 --> 01:23:30,654
No.

1159
01:23:30,810 --> 01:23:32,938
- Did you expect to receive any?
- No, sir.

1160
01:23:33,145 --> 01:23:37,867
Did you know that in her new will,
you were the beneficiary of £80,000?

1161
01:23:38,192 --> 01:23:39,353
No, I didn't.

1162
01:23:39,527 --> 01:23:44,215
Now, Mr Vole, when you went to visit
Mrs French for the last time,

1163
01:23:44,532 --> 01:23:47,695
did you wear a trench
coat and a brown hat?

1164
01:23:48,786 --> 01:23:52,313
- Yes, I did.
- Was it this coat and hat?

1165
01:23:54,125 --> 01:23:55,092
Yes, sir.

1166
01:23:55,251 --> 01:24:00,257
My lord, the defence, in its efforts
to establish an alibi for the prisoner,

1167
01:24:00,589 --> 01:24:03,718
circulated this photograph,
hoping to bring forth a witness

1168
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:07,051
who had seen him leaving Mrs
French's house or entering his own

1169
01:24:07,304 --> 01:24:09,784
at the times that he has stated.

1170
01:24:10,015 --> 01:24:13,337
Apparently, this splendid
effort was without results.

1171
01:24:13,602 --> 01:24:15,889
However, the defence
will be pleased to learn

1172
01:24:16,105 --> 01:24:19,188
that, at the last moment,
a witness has come forward,

1173
01:24:19,442 --> 01:24:23,925
and that the prisoner had been seen
wearing this coat and this hat.

1174
01:24:24,238 --> 01:24:29,449
Lamentably, he had not been seen on the
night of the murder but one week before.

1175
01:24:29,785 --> 01:24:33,915
On the afternoon of October 8, were you
not in a travel agency in Regent Street?

1176
01:24:34,206 --> 01:24:38,097
And did you not make inquiries about
prices and schedules of foreign cruises?

1177
01:24:38,377 --> 01:24:41,540
Supposing I did?
It's not a crime, is it?

1178
01:24:41,797 --> 01:24:45,768
Not at all. Many people go on a cruise
when they can afford to pay for it.

1179
01:24:46,051 --> 01:24:50,898
- But you couldn't pay for it, could you?
- Well, I was hard up. I told you that.

1180
01:24:51,223 --> 01:24:56,263
And yet you came to this particular
travel agency with a clinging brunette?

1181
01:24:56,604 --> 01:24:58,925
A clinging brunette, Mr Myers?

1182
01:24:59,815 --> 01:25:01,817
My lord, the lady was
so described to me.

1183
01:25:02,026 --> 01:25:06,315
She was very affectionate with the
prisoner, constantly clinging to his arm.

1184
01:25:06,614 --> 01:25:08,503
Oh.

1185
01:25:09,325 --> 01:25:13,728
You then admit that you made inquiries
about expensive and luxurious cruises?

1186
01:25:14,038 --> 01:25:16,120
How did you expect to
pay for such a thing?

1187
01:25:16,332 --> 01:25:19,461
- I don't know. It was...
- If you don't know, perhaps I can help.

1188
01:25:19,710 --> 01:25:23,920
On the morning of the very same day,
you heard Mrs French change her will,

1189
01:25:24,215 --> 01:25:26,502
- leaving you the bulk of her money.
- I didn't!

1190
01:25:26,717 --> 01:25:29,687
And in the afternoon, you
started plans to dispose of it.

1191
01:25:29,929 --> 01:25:32,057
No! It was nothing of the kind.

1192
01:25:32,264 --> 01:25:35,313
I was in a pub and I met a girl.
I don't even remember her name.

1193
01:25:35,559 --> 01:25:37,607
We had a drink and
walked out together.

1194
01:25:37,812 --> 01:25:43,615
We passed the window and saw the fancy
posters, all blue seas and palm trees.

1195
01:25:43,984 --> 01:25:49,070
The Grecian isles or somewhere. We went
in for fun and I started asking for folders.

1196
01:25:49,406 --> 01:25:53,127
Well, the man gave me a funny look
because I did look a bit shabby.

1197
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:56,698
Anyway, it irritated me, so I kept
asking for the swankiest tours,

1198
01:25:56,956 --> 01:26:00,324
all deluxe and cabin on the boat
deck, but it was just an act!

1199
01:26:00,584 --> 01:26:04,589
An act? You knew that in a week
you were going to inherit £80,000!

1200
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:09,249
No! it wasn't that way at all. It was
make-believe and childish but...

1201
01:26:09,552 --> 01:26:13,796
it was fun and I enjoyed it. I never thought
of killing anyone or inheriting any money.

1202
01:26:14,098 --> 01:26:17,898
It's just a coincidence that Mrs French
should be killed only one week later?

1203
01:26:18,185 --> 01:26:20,552
I told you! I didn't kill her!

1204
01:26:21,272 --> 01:26:25,197
Do you know any reason why Christine
Helm should give the evidence she has

1205
01:26:25,484 --> 01:26:29,170
- if it were not true?
- No. I don't know why my wife...

1206
01:26:30,030 --> 01:26:35,070
I don't know why I still call her my wife.
She must be lying or out of her mind.

1207
01:26:35,411 --> 01:26:37,937
She seemed remarkably
sane and self-possessed.

1208
01:26:38,164 --> 01:26:42,488
- But insanity is all you can suggest?
- I don't understand it.

1209
01:26:42,793 --> 01:26:45,239
Oh, God! What's happened?
What's changed her?

1210
01:26:45,463 --> 01:26:49,388
Very effective, I'm sure. But in
this court we deal with fact.

1211
01:26:49,675 --> 01:26:52,485
And the fact, Mr Vole, is that
we've only your word for it.

1212
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:55,530
That you left Mrs French's
house at the time you say,

1213
01:26:55,765 --> 01:27:00,373
that you came home at 5 and 20 minutes
past 9, and that you did not go out again!

1214
01:27:00,686 --> 01:27:03,735
Somebody must have seen me in the
street or going in the house!

1215
01:27:03,981 --> 01:27:08,191
One would think so. But the only person
who did see you come home that night

1216
01:27:08,486 --> 01:27:11,649
says it was ten past ten and that
you had blood on your hands.

1217
01:27:11,906 --> 01:27:14,796
- I cut my wrist!
- You cut your wrist deliberately!

1218
01:27:15,034 --> 01:27:17,002
No, I didn't! I didn't do anything.

1219
01:27:17,203 --> 01:27:20,013
But you make it sound as though
I did. I can hear it myself.

1220
01:27:20,247 --> 01:27:22,375
You came home at ten past ten!

1221
01:27:22,583 --> 01:27:26,793
No, I didn't! You've got to believe me.
You've got to believe me!

1222
01:27:27,087 --> 01:27:29,215
You killed Emily French!

1223
01:27:29,423 --> 01:27:31,664
No, I didn't! I didn't do it!

1224
01:27:31,884 --> 01:27:35,605
I didn't kill her!
I never killed anybody!

1225
01:27:35,888 --> 01:27:40,291
God, it's like a nightmare.
Some ghastly, horrible dream.

1226
01:27:46,148 --> 01:27:48,515
Good evening, Sir Wilfrid.
How did it go today?

1227
01:27:48,734 --> 01:27:50,896
Oh, Sir Wilfrid.

1228
01:27:51,112 --> 01:27:56,243
I'm from Hawks and Hill, sir, and I've
brought your Bermuda shorts for a fitting.

1229
01:27:57,493 --> 01:27:58,460
What?

1230
01:27:58,619 --> 01:28:02,988
- You'd better slip these on, Sir Wilfrid.
- I'm in the middle of a murder trial.

1231
01:28:03,290 --> 01:28:07,181
It'll all be over by the afternoon, and
the boat train doesn't go until 9.40.

1232
01:28:07,461 --> 01:28:10,749
You work it out. You know my shape,
you've stabbed it often enough.

1233
01:28:11,006 --> 01:28:15,375
Upstairs. You need a lukewarm
bath and your calcium injection.

1234
01:28:15,678 --> 01:28:18,522
And there's a lot more
packing to be done.

1235
01:28:19,598 --> 01:28:24,240
It's ridiculous having boat reservations.
The jury may be out for days.

1236
01:28:24,562 --> 01:28:28,726
Not on this case, I'm afraid.
It seems too open-and-shut.

1237
01:28:30,943 --> 01:28:34,425
I watched when Frau Helm was on
the stand. They didn't like her.

1238
01:28:34,697 --> 01:28:38,782
No, but they believed her. They liked
Leonard Vole but they didn't believe him.

1239
01:28:39,076 --> 01:28:42,205
And that travel agency business
doesn't help either. Cigar?

1240
01:28:42,455 --> 01:28:43,263
No.

1241
01:28:43,414 --> 01:28:46,099
- Wilfrid, do you think she lied?
- Well, don't you?

1242
01:28:46,333 --> 01:28:47,619
I'm not sure.

1243
01:28:47,793 --> 01:28:51,400
I am. She lied. Whether she calls
it Meineid or perjury, she lied.

1244
01:28:51,672 --> 01:28:56,519
The only question is why. What's
her game? What is she up to? What?

1245
01:28:57,303 --> 01:29:02,264
I hope that in your final speech you
won't become too emotionally involved.

1246
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:05,410
- You must think of your condition.
- He's right.

1247
01:29:05,644 --> 01:29:09,046
I want to see you save yourself.
This isn't going to be your last case.

1248
01:29:09,315 --> 01:29:12,922
Yes, it is. But until it's over,
I'm still a barrister.

1249
01:29:13,194 --> 01:29:16,880
My client's life is at stake.
That's all that matters... his life.

1250
01:29:17,156 --> 01:29:19,921
He's entitled to the
best that I can do.

1251
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:24,050
If I can't stand up to make my final
appeal for him, I'll make it sitting down.

1252
01:29:24,330 --> 01:29:28,494
If I become short of breath I'll take a pill,
or two pills, or all of them and the box too.

1253
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:39,520
- Yes?
- This Sir Wilfrid Robarts' place?

1254
01:29:39,762 --> 01:29:43,050
- Well, yes, it is.
- Let me talk to the old geezer.

1255
01:29:43,307 --> 01:29:47,517
- Who is this speaking, please?
- Never you mind. Let me talk to 'im.

1256
01:29:47,812 --> 01:29:51,214
I'm afraid that's impossible. What
is the nature of your business?

1257
01:29:51,482 --> 01:29:54,645
It's business all right. I've got
something to sell 'im, I 'ave.

1258
01:29:54,902 --> 01:29:56,108
Well, really, madam!

1259
01:29:56,278 --> 01:29:59,168
And what I want to sell 'im,
believe me, 'e'll want to buy.

1260
01:29:59,406 --> 01:30:02,967
- It's got to do with that Leonard Vole.
- Leonard Vole?

1261
01:30:03,244 --> 01:30:05,406
It's about that German wife.

1262
01:30:05,621 --> 01:30:09,023
I've got the goods on
her and it's for sale.

1263
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:14,726
This is Wilfrid Robarts speaking.
Now, what is this all about?

1264
01:30:15,005 --> 01:30:17,246
Well, hello, ducky.

1265
01:30:17,466 --> 01:30:20,276
What is this you said
about Mrs Leonard Vole?

1266
01:30:20,511 --> 01:30:24,232
I'm not just saying.
I've got it in black and white.

1267
01:30:24,515 --> 01:30:27,359
- You've got what?
- Listen to this carefully, ducks.

1268
01:30:27,601 --> 01:30:30,969
I'm at the buffet at Euston Station
at the far end of the bar.

1269
01:30:31,230 --> 01:30:34,518
I'll be here for 30 minutes because
that's when me train leaves.

1270
01:30:34,775 --> 01:30:37,938
If you want the lowdown on that
German bag, get yourself here.

1271
01:30:38,195 --> 01:30:40,641
What lowdown?
What do you know about her?

1272
01:30:40,865 --> 01:30:42,947
Uh-uh. Not on the phone.

1273
01:30:43,159 --> 01:30:47,244
You'd better get on over here,
and bring plenty of money.

1274
01:30:48,038 --> 01:30:51,247
Now, just a moment! Hello? Hello?

1275
01:30:53,252 --> 01:30:58,816
That's... bilge. Some drunken crank.
You get those in every murder trial.

1276
01:30:59,175 --> 01:31:03,544
Giving me an ultimatum, Euston Station in
30 minutes. Got the lowdown on Mrs Vole.

1277
01:31:03,846 --> 01:31:05,610
Balderdash.

1278
01:31:05,806 --> 01:31:11,051
I'm too old and too sick to
go on a wild-goose chase.

1279
01:31:11,395 --> 01:31:14,160
- Come on, Mayhew.
- Where to, Sir Wilfrid?

1280
01:31:14,398 --> 01:31:17,368
Euston Station, where do you think?

1281
01:31:19,111 --> 01:31:21,034
Now, sir?

1282
01:31:21,238 --> 01:31:23,002
Shortly.

1283
01:31:23,991 --> 01:31:25,481
Cigar!

1284
01:31:26,452 --> 01:31:28,420
Sir Wilfrid, where are you going?

1285
01:31:28,621 --> 01:31:33,149
Your bath, your massage,
your dinner, your injection!

1286
01:31:33,459 --> 01:31:35,427
Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.

1287
01:32:01,487 --> 01:32:04,411
- You wouldn't be Sir Wilfrid, would you?
- I would.

1288
01:32:04,657 --> 01:32:09,219
Didn't recognise you without your wig.
Lovely you all look in them wigs.

1289
01:32:09,537 --> 01:32:11,778
Two o' yer? I'm not
talking to two o' yer.

1290
01:32:11,997 --> 01:32:14,443
This is Mr Mayhew,
Leonard Vole's solicitor.

1291
01:32:14,667 --> 01:32:17,591
- Well, that's all right, then.
- And your name, please?

1292
01:32:17,837 --> 01:32:23,082
No need for mine. If did give you a name
it mightn't be the right one, might it?

1293
01:32:23,425 --> 01:32:27,510
'Ave a drink, boys. Two whiskies
for me gen'lmen friends.

1294
01:32:27,805 --> 01:32:30,285
Now what is this information
you allegedly have?

1295
01:32:30,516 --> 01:32:34,805
You realise that you're duty-bound to
give any evidence that you might have?

1296
01:32:35,104 --> 01:32:39,553
- Come off it. Did you bring any money?
- What is it you have, madam?

1297
01:32:39,859 --> 01:32:44,183
Letters. Letters that German wife
of 'is wrote. That's what I've got.

1298
01:32:44,488 --> 01:32:49,130
- Letters written to the prisoner?
- To the prisoner? Don't make me laugh.

1299
01:32:49,452 --> 01:32:53,218
Poor bleeder, he's been took in by 'er
all right. And these letters prove it.

1300
01:32:53,497 --> 01:32:58,458
If we could see these letters, we could
advise you as to how pertinent they are.

1301
01:32:58,794 --> 01:33:01,445
Well, I don't expect you...

1302
01:33:04,758 --> 01:33:08,649
Well, as I say, I don't expect you to
buy without seeing, but fair's fair.

1303
01:33:08,929 --> 01:33:13,298
If these letters get the boy off,
it's £100 for me, right?

1304
01:33:13,601 --> 01:33:18,289
If these letters contain information useful
to the defence, I'm prepared to offer £10.

1305
01:33:18,606 --> 01:33:21,894
What? Ten bleeding pounds
for letters like these?

1306
01:33:22,151 --> 01:33:24,882
Take that piece of glass
out o' yer eye. Good night.

1307
01:33:25,112 --> 01:33:27,160
If these help prove my
client's innocence,

1308
01:33:27,364 --> 01:33:30,766
£20 should, I think, not be an
unreasonable sum for your expenses.

1309
01:33:31,035 --> 01:33:33,959
50 and it's a bargain. That's
if you're satisfied with 'em.

1310
01:33:34,205 --> 01:33:36,492
- £40.
- All right, blast yer.

1311
01:33:36,707 --> 01:33:39,472
'Ere, take 'em.
Nice little lot there.

1312
01:33:39,710 --> 01:33:41,678
How do we know these
are from Mrs Vole?

1313
01:33:41,879 --> 01:33:46,043
Oh, she wrote 'em all right.
It's all fair an' square.

1314
01:33:48,803 --> 01:33:51,568
I 'ope they fix 'er
good and proper.

1315
01:33:53,557 --> 01:33:57,278
I've had messages from Mrs Vole.
It looks like her handwriting.

1316
01:33:57,561 --> 01:33:59,928
Good heavens, look at this.

1317
01:34:02,608 --> 01:34:04,576
Juicy, ain't they?

1318
01:34:04,777 --> 01:34:08,577
- There's one that's even better.
- How did you get hold of these?

1319
01:34:08,864 --> 01:34:11,834
What's the difference so long
as she gets what's coming?

1320
01:34:12,076 --> 01:34:15,125
- What have you got against her?
- Ha!

1321
01:34:15,371 --> 01:34:18,659
I'll give you something
to dream about, mister.

1322
01:34:19,875 --> 01:34:22,242
Want to kiss me, ducky?

1323
01:34:26,006 --> 01:34:26,768
Ha!

1324
01:34:26,924 --> 01:34:30,724
- I didn't suppose you would.
- Christine Vole did that to you?

1325
01:34:31,011 --> 01:34:35,778
Not 'er, the chap I was going with. He was
a bit younger than me but I loved 'im.

1326
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:40,901
Then she come along, started seeing 'im
on the sly. Then one day he cleared out.

1327
01:34:41,230 --> 01:34:46,441
I found 'em together. I said what I thought
of 'er and he cut me face up proper.

1328
01:34:46,777 --> 01:34:50,987
- Did you go to the police about it?
- Who, me? Not likely.

1329
01:34:51,282 --> 01:34:56,812
It wasn't 'is fault. It was all 'ers, gettin'
'im away from me, turnin' 'im against me.

1330
01:34:57,163 --> 01:35:01,885
But I waited me time to pay
'er back. And it's come now.

1331
01:35:02,209 --> 01:35:07,295
I'm deeply sorry, deeply sorry. We'll
make it another £5 for the letters.

1332
01:35:07,631 --> 01:35:11,795
'Olding out on me, were yer?
I knew I was being soft with yer.

1333
01:35:12,094 --> 01:35:15,541
Cold-blooded vindictiveness.
Read this one.

1334
01:35:17,641 --> 01:35:20,121
Unbelievable.

1335
01:35:20,352 --> 01:35:24,482
We'd better have the full name of the man
to whom these were addressed, Miss...

1336
01:35:24,774 --> 01:35:26,697
Miss, um...

1337
01:35:26,901 --> 01:35:28,710
Where is she?

1338
01:35:34,784 --> 01:35:40,348
On that train, I should think. Doesn't want
her other cheek slashed. Can't blame her.

1339
01:35:42,958 --> 01:35:44,960
- Care for another, sir?
- Hm?

1340
01:35:45,169 --> 01:35:47,137
Good idea.

1341
01:35:56,222 --> 01:35:57,667
Silence!

1342
01:35:57,848 --> 01:35:59,896
Be upstanding in court.

1343
01:36:01,018 --> 01:36:03,624
All persons who have anything
to do before my lords,

1344
01:36:03,854 --> 01:36:05,902
the queen's justices
of oyer and terminer

1345
01:36:06,107 --> 01:36:09,953
and general jail delivery for the
jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court,

1346
01:36:10,236 --> 01:36:14,400
draw near and give your attendance.
God save the queen.

1347
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:31,583
Since the defence has called
but one witness, the prisoner,

1348
01:36:31,841 --> 01:36:34,162
it has the right to be heard last.

1349
01:36:34,385 --> 01:36:40,427
Mr Myers, if you are ready, let us have
the final address for the prosecution.

1350
01:36:40,808 --> 01:36:45,018
My lord, members of the jury,
I will be brief in my final speech

1351
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:49,840
because I think we've proved so obvious
a case of murder against Leonard Vole,

1352
01:36:50,151 --> 01:36:53,439
that a verdict of guilty must be
the only possible conclusion.

1353
01:36:54,196 --> 01:36:57,757
I will briefly summarise
these facts...

1354
01:37:03,664 --> 01:37:05,871
You'd better begin again, Mr Myers.

1355
01:37:06,542 --> 01:37:10,672
That is, if Sir Wilfrid is at all
interested in our proceedings.

1356
01:37:10,963 --> 01:37:15,252
I am, indeed, my lord. The speech for
the crown, however, is premature.

1357
01:37:15,551 --> 01:37:20,352
I ask that the case for the defence be
reopened. And that a witness be recalled.

1358
01:37:20,681 --> 01:37:24,402
I most strenuously object to the case
being reopened at this final stage.

1359
01:37:24,685 --> 01:37:27,814
Evidence of a startling nature
has come into my possession.

1360
01:37:28,063 --> 01:37:31,351
The course my learned friend
proposes is quite unprecedented.

1361
01:37:31,609 --> 01:37:35,250
I have anticipated this objection and
can meet it with ample precedent.

1362
01:37:35,529 --> 01:37:41,093
There is the king vs Stillman, reported
in the criminal appeal reports of 1926

1363
01:37:41,452 --> 01:37:43,773
at page 463.

1364
01:37:43,996 --> 01:37:48,081
Also, the king vs Porter in volume one
of the king's bench division reports,

1365
01:37:48,375 --> 01:37:51,663
1942 at page 153.

1366
01:37:51,921 --> 01:37:54,686
And lastly there is the case
of the king vs Sullivan

1367
01:37:54,924 --> 01:37:58,849
in which this issue was raised, which
I'm sure Your Lordship will remember,

1368
01:37:59,136 --> 01:38:01,616
since you appeared
for the prosecution.

1369
01:38:01,847 --> 01:38:06,375
I did? Oh, yes, before
Mr Justice Swindon.

1370
01:38:06,685 --> 01:38:08,847
What is this new
evidence, Sir Wilfrid?

1371
01:38:09,063 --> 01:38:11,065
Letters, my lord.

1372
01:38:11,273 --> 01:38:14,243
Letters written by Christine Helm.

1373
01:38:16,695 --> 01:38:20,142
My lord, the prosecution
continues its objection.

1374
01:38:20,407 --> 01:38:23,809
If my memory serves me well,
Your Lordship's similar objection

1375
01:38:24,078 --> 01:38:27,685
in the king against
Sullivan was sustained.

1376
01:38:29,708 --> 01:38:33,155
Your memory, for once,
serves you ill, Mr Myers.

1377
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:37,789
My objection then was overruled
by Mr Justice Swindon.

1378
01:38:38,092 --> 01:38:41,141
As yours is now, by me.

1379
01:38:47,643 --> 01:38:49,771
Call Christine Helm.

1380
01:38:50,646 --> 01:38:52,250
Christine Helm.

1381
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:55,125
- Christine Helm.
- Christine Helm.

1382
01:39:11,834 --> 01:39:16,635
If you still have doubts about Mr Vole, I
wouldn't mind betting you a box of cigars.

1383
01:39:16,964 --> 01:39:20,810
Mrs Helm, you appreciate
you are still under oath?

1384
01:39:21,093 --> 01:39:22,254
Yes.

1385
01:39:22,428 --> 01:39:27,912
- Do you know a man named Max?
- I don't know what you mean.

1386
01:39:28,267 --> 01:39:32,113
It's a simple question. Do you or
do you not know a man called Max?

1387
01:39:32,396 --> 01:39:34,603
Max? Certainly not.

1388
01:39:34,815 --> 01:39:38,501
It's a fairly common name and yet
you've never known a man named Max?

1389
01:39:38,778 --> 01:39:41,179
In Germany, perhaps,
but a long time ago.

1390
01:39:41,405 --> 01:39:48,015
I shall not ask you to go back that far.
Just a few weeks, to... October 20 last.

1391
01:39:49,914 --> 01:39:52,758
- What have you got there?
- A letter.

1392
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,241
I suggest that on October 20

1393
01:39:55,461 --> 01:39:58,670
- you wrote a letter...
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1394
01:39:58,923 --> 01:40:02,291
- ...Addressed to a man named Max.
- I did nothing of the sort.

1395
01:40:02,551 --> 01:40:06,476
The letter was but one of a
series written to the same man.

1396
01:40:07,473 --> 01:40:09,521
Lies! All lies!

1397
01:40:09,725 --> 01:40:13,696
You seem to have been, well, let us
say, on intimate terms with this man.

1398
01:40:13,979 --> 01:40:16,630
How dare you say a thing like that?
It isn't true!

1399
01:40:16,857 --> 01:40:22,148
I'm not concerned with the general trend
of this correspondence, only one letter.

1400
01:40:22,488 --> 01:40:27,176
"My beloved Max, an extraordinary
thing has happened."

1401
01:40:27,493 --> 01:40:30,337
"I believe all our
difficulties may be ended."

1402
01:40:30,579 --> 01:40:33,059
I will not stand here and
listen to a pack of lies!

1403
01:40:33,290 --> 01:40:36,976
That letter's a forgery.
It isn't even my letter paper!

1404
01:40:37,253 --> 01:40:39,460
- It isn't?
- No!

1405
01:40:39,672 --> 01:40:42,960
I write my letters on small blue
paper with my initials on it.

1406
01:40:47,179 --> 01:40:48,669
Like this?

1407
01:40:51,434 --> 01:40:56,565
This is a bill from my tailor for a pair
of extremely becoming Bermuda shorts.

1408
01:40:58,357 --> 01:41:02,646
Wilfrid the fox! That's what we
call him and that's what he is.

1409
01:41:02,945 --> 01:41:07,109
Now, Mrs Helm, you've been kind
enough to identify your letter paper.

1410
01:41:07,408 --> 01:41:12,130
Now, if you like, I can have an
expert identify your handwriting.

1411
01:41:12,455 --> 01:41:14,264
Damn you!

1412
01:41:14,832 --> 01:41:17,722
- Damn you!
- Leave her alone!

1413
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:20,088
- Damn you!
- Mrs Helm!

1414
01:41:20,296 --> 01:41:23,664
Let me go! Let me get
out of here! Let me go!

1415
01:41:23,924 --> 01:41:25,289
- Mrs Helm!
- Let me go!

1416
01:41:25,468 --> 01:41:28,074
Usher, get the witness a chair.

1417
01:41:34,477 --> 01:41:40,439
Sir Wilfrid, will you now read the letter
in question so that the jury may hear it?

1418
01:41:45,738 --> 01:41:50,824
"My beloved Max, an extraordinary
thing has happened."

1419
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:54,687
"All our difficulties
may soon be solved."

1420
01:41:54,955 --> 01:41:59,836
"Leonard is suspected of murdering
the old lady I told you about."

1421
01:42:00,169 --> 01:42:05,778
"His only hope of an alibi
depends on me and me alone."

1422
01:42:07,051 --> 01:42:13,058
"Suppose I testify that he was not at
home with me at the time of the murder,

1423
01:42:13,432 --> 01:42:17,153
that he came home with
blood on his sleeves,

1424
01:42:17,436 --> 01:42:21,202
and that he even admitted to
me that he'd killed her?"

1425
01:42:21,482 --> 01:42:24,804
"Strange that he always said he
would never let me leave him."

1426
01:42:25,069 --> 01:42:28,551
"But now, if this succeeds,
he will be leaving me

1427
01:42:28,823 --> 01:42:32,544
because they will
take him away forever

1428
01:42:32,827 --> 01:42:37,389
and I shall be free and
yours, my beloved."

1429
01:42:37,706 --> 01:42:42,348
"I count the hours until we
are together. Christine."

1430
01:42:45,589 --> 01:42:49,389
Mrs Helm? Will you go
back to the witness box?

1431
01:42:59,728 --> 01:43:04,768
I now ask you again, Christine
Helm, did you write this letter?

1432
01:43:05,109 --> 01:43:08,238
Christine, tell him you didn't
write it. I know you didn't.

1433
01:43:08,487 --> 01:43:12,458
Please answer my question.
Did you write this letter?

1434
01:43:12,741 --> 01:43:14,470
Before answering, Mrs Helm,

1435
01:43:14,660 --> 01:43:19,826
I wish to warn you that the law regarding
perjury in this country is very severe.

1436
01:43:20,166 --> 01:43:23,613
If you have already committed
perjury in this courtroom,

1437
01:43:23,878 --> 01:43:27,360
I strongly advise you not
to add to your crime.

1438
01:43:27,631 --> 01:43:31,238
But, if this letter has
not been written by you,

1439
01:43:31,510 --> 01:43:35,071
then now is the time
to state this fact.

1440
01:43:37,725 --> 01:43:39,807
I wrote the letter.

1441
01:43:42,396 --> 01:43:46,162
And that, my lord, is the
case for the defence.

1442
01:43:54,158 --> 01:43:57,446
I keep asking which is harder,
your head or your arteries?

1443
01:43:57,703 --> 01:43:59,785
Stop pressing your luck,
you're overdue.

1444
01:43:59,997 --> 01:44:03,968
We're all packed and ready. I hope
the jury won't take all afternoon.

1445
01:44:04,251 --> 01:44:05,412
I concede.

1446
01:44:05,586 --> 01:44:08,669
- Congratulations, here are your cigars.
- Not yet.

1447
01:44:08,923 --> 01:44:12,291
Come on, it's all over,
wrapped up neat and tidy.

1448
01:44:12,551 --> 01:44:15,839
- What's wrong?
- It's a little too neat, too tidy,

1449
01:44:16,097 --> 01:44:20,068
and altogether too symmetrical,
that's what's wrong with it.

1450
01:44:20,351 --> 01:44:23,480
- The jury is back.
- You're not worried about the verdict?

1451
01:44:23,729 --> 01:44:27,734
It's not their judgment
that worries me, it's mine.

1452
01:44:28,109 --> 01:44:29,873
Come along.

1453
01:44:30,903 --> 01:44:32,871
Where's my Wig?

1454
01:45:01,892 --> 01:45:04,259
The prisoner will stand up.

1455
01:45:06,897 --> 01:45:11,664
Members of the jury, are you
all agreed upon your verdict?

1456
01:45:13,404 --> 01:45:14,610
We are.

1457
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:18,865
Do you find the prisoner at the
bar, Leonard Stephen Vole,

1458
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:23,529
guilty or not guilty of the
murder of Emily Jane French?

1459
01:45:27,626 --> 01:45:28,991
Not guilty, m'lord.

1460
01:45:49,064 --> 01:45:50,350
Silence!

1461
01:45:50,649 --> 01:45:52,333
Silence!

1462
01:45:55,321 --> 01:45:58,962
Leonard Stephen Vole, you
have been found not guilty

1463
01:45:59,241 --> 01:46:03,644
of the murder of Emily
Jane French on October 14.

1464
01:46:03,954 --> 01:46:08,278
You are hereby discharged and
are free to leave the court.

1465
01:46:19,345 --> 01:46:22,554
Persons with anything more to
do before the queen's justices

1466
01:46:22,807 --> 01:46:24,969
of oyer and terminer
and jail delivery

1467
01:46:25,184 --> 01:46:29,951
for the jurisdiction of the Central
Criminal Court may depart the area.

1468
01:46:38,864 --> 01:46:42,425
Thank you. Yes, we'll talk later.
Thank you, Mr Mayhew.

1469
01:46:42,701 --> 01:46:45,102
Thank you, Mr Brogan-Moore. Carter.

1470
01:46:45,329 --> 01:46:48,617
Thank you, Sir Wilfrid, for everything.
You were wonderful.

1471
01:46:48,874 --> 01:46:52,560
- I'd say we were lucky all around.
- Yeah.

1472
01:46:52,837 --> 01:46:56,523
I have your belongings. Sign the receipt,
Mr Vole, and we can release you.

1473
01:46:56,799 --> 01:46:59,803
"Mr Vole." They didn't call
me Mr when they charged me.

1474
01:47:00,052 --> 01:47:05,013
- I'll go with you, I have your hat and coat.
- Let's go before they change their mind!

1475
01:47:14,692 --> 01:47:17,821
Chipper, isn't he? An hour ago,
he had one foot on the gallows

1476
01:47:18,070 --> 01:47:20,118
and the other on a banana peel.

1477
01:47:20,322 --> 01:47:23,405
You ought to be very proud,
Wilfrid. Aren't you?

1478
01:47:23,659 --> 01:47:26,549
Not yet. We've disposed
of the gallows,

1479
01:47:26,787 --> 01:47:30,712
but there's still that banana peel
somewhere, under somebody's foot.

1480
01:47:44,472 --> 01:47:48,955
- Every word you said was a lie!
- You ought to be locked up! Liar!

1481
01:47:49,268 --> 01:47:52,477
You'd better wait here until we
get rid of that crowd, madam.

1482
01:47:52,730 --> 01:47:54,698
Thank you.

1483
01:47:58,527 --> 01:48:01,690
Ready, sir?
Miss Plimsoll will be waiting.

1484
01:48:01,947 --> 01:48:07,272
Let me finish the last of the cocoa while
I'm still beyond her jurisdiction.

1485
01:48:07,620 --> 01:48:11,830
Would you excuse me,
Brogan-Moore, Carter? Thank you.

1486
01:48:38,943 --> 01:48:42,868
I never thought you British could get
so emotional. Especially in public.

1487
01:48:43,155 --> 01:48:45,601
- I apologise for my compatriots.
- It's all right.

1488
01:48:45,825 --> 01:48:49,591
I don't mind being called names or pushed
around or even kicked in the shin.

1489
01:48:49,870 --> 01:48:52,111
But I have a ladder in
my last pair of nylons.

1490
01:48:52,331 --> 01:48:56,461
In case you are not familiar with our
prison regulations, no silk stockings.

1491
01:48:56,752 --> 01:48:58,880
Prison? Will I go to prison?

1492
01:48:59,088 --> 01:49:02,570
You heard the judge. You will
certainly be charged with perjury,

1493
01:49:02,842 --> 01:49:07,006
- tried for it, and to prison you shall go.
- Well, it won't be for life, will it?

1494
01:49:07,304 --> 01:49:10,786
If I were appearing for the
prosecution, it would be.

1495
01:49:11,058 --> 01:49:14,904
You loathe me, don't you?
Like the people outside.

1496
01:49:15,187 --> 01:49:18,191
What a wicked woman I am,
and how brilliantly you exposed me

1497
01:49:18,441 --> 01:49:22,969
and saved Leonard's life. The great
Sir Wilfrid Robarts did it again.

1498
01:49:23,279 --> 01:49:28,809
Well, let me tell you something.
You didn't do it alone. You had help.

1499
01:49:30,119 --> 01:49:31,769
What are you driving at?

1500
01:49:31,954 --> 01:49:34,798
I'm not driving at anything.
Leonard is free and we did it.

1501
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:36,405
- We?
- Remember?

1502
01:49:36,584 --> 01:49:40,111
When you said that no jury would believe
an alibi given by a loving wife,

1503
01:49:40,379 --> 01:49:44,304
no matter how much she swore he was
innocent? That gave me the idea.

1504
01:49:44,592 --> 01:49:46,117
What idea?

1505
01:49:46,302 --> 01:49:50,626
The idea that I should be a witness, not
for my husband, but for the prosecution.

1506
01:49:50,931 --> 01:49:54,731
That I should swear Leonard was guilty
and that you should expose me as a liar

1507
01:49:55,019 --> 01:49:59,104
because only then would they
believe Leonard was innocent.

1508
01:49:59,398 --> 01:50:02,959
So now you know the whole
story, Sir Wilfrid.

1509
01:50:08,407 --> 01:50:12,457
I'll give yer something
to dream about, mister.

1510
01:50:12,745 --> 01:50:15,316
Want to kiss me, ducky?

1511
01:50:19,168 --> 01:50:23,093
I suspected something,
but not that.

1512
01:50:23,380 --> 01:50:26,270
- Never that!
- Thank you for the compliment.

1513
01:50:26,509 --> 01:50:30,116
It's been a long time since I acted
and I never played such a vital role.

1514
01:50:30,387 --> 01:50:33,152
All those blue letters!

1515
01:50:33,390 --> 01:50:36,872
It took me hours to write them,
to invent Max. There never was a Max.

1516
01:50:37,144 --> 01:50:39,511
There's never been
anyone but Leonard.

1517
01:50:39,730 --> 01:50:41,892
My dear, could you
not have trusted me,

1518
01:50:42,108 --> 01:50:45,908
worked with me truthfully and
honourably? We would have won.

1519
01:50:46,195 --> 01:50:49,005
I could not run that risk.
You thought he was innocent.

1520
01:50:49,240 --> 01:50:52,289
And you knew he was innocent.
I understand.

1521
01:50:52,535 --> 01:50:55,698
No, Sir Wilfrid, you do
not understand at all.

1522
01:50:55,955 --> 01:50:58,322
I knew he was guilty.

1523
01:51:01,836 --> 01:51:04,680
That can't be true! No!

1524
01:51:06,006 --> 01:51:08,327
Listen to me, once and for all.

1525
01:51:08,551 --> 01:51:11,157
He came home after ten,
he had blood on his sleeves,

1526
01:51:11,387 --> 01:51:14,709
he said he had killed the woman,
only I could save him. He pleaded.

1527
01:51:14,974 --> 01:51:17,978
And you saved him? A murderer?

1528
01:51:18,227 --> 01:51:20,275
Again, you don't understand.

1529
01:51:20,479 --> 01:51:22,447
I love him.

1530
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,607
I told you she was an actress.
And a good one.

1531
01:51:30,823 --> 01:51:32,393
Leonard!

1532
01:51:32,575 --> 01:51:35,624
I knew she'd do something,
but I just didn't know what or how.

1533
01:51:35,870 --> 01:51:37,838
Leonard, Leonard.

1534
01:51:39,957 --> 01:51:45,248
- Fooled you completely, didn't she?
- It was you, Vole, who fooled me.

1535
01:51:45,588 --> 01:51:51,038
Oh, easy. Easy. We both got out of
this alive, let's stay this way.

1536
01:51:51,385 --> 01:51:54,753
- Where are your pills?
- You've made a mockery of English law.

1537
01:51:55,014 --> 01:51:58,143
Who did? You got me off and
I can't be tried again for this.

1538
01:51:58,392 --> 01:52:02,795
- That's English law too, isn't it?
- You can't touch him now. Nobody can.

1539
01:52:03,105 --> 01:52:05,711
The scales of justice may
tip one way or another,

1540
01:52:05,941 --> 01:52:08,945
but ultimately they balance out.
You'll pay for this.

1541
01:52:09,195 --> 01:52:13,200
Ultimately's a long way off. I'd rather pay
for it as soon as possible and in cash.

1542
01:52:13,491 --> 01:52:17,860
Suppose we double your fee? There'll be
lots of money once the will goes through.

1543
01:52:18,162 --> 01:52:21,006
I'm not cheap, I want everybody
to get something out of it.

1544
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:24,695
There's Janet McKenzie.
We'll get her that new hearing aid.

1545
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:29,761
And we'll get you a new one of these.
18-carat gold if they make them.

1546
01:52:30,091 --> 01:52:33,652
And when they try you for perjury
there'll be £5,000 for the defence.

1547
01:52:33,928 --> 01:52:38,490
I don't care, just so we'll be together.
You don't know what I've been through.

1548
01:52:38,808 --> 01:52:43,575
Standing in the witness box, having to
face you, saying I never loved you.

1549
01:52:43,896 --> 01:52:45,057
What is it, Leonard?

1550
01:52:45,231 --> 01:52:48,952
The luggage is in the car and we've only
20 minutes to catch the boat train.

1551
01:52:49,235 --> 01:52:51,715
This is a nice young lady
I met during the trial.

1552
01:52:51,946 --> 01:52:53,232
Len!

1553
01:52:53,405 --> 01:52:55,009
Oh, Len!

1554
01:52:55,199 --> 01:52:56,769
Len...

1555
01:52:58,452 --> 01:53:02,013
Oh, Len, they've been trying to keep
me away. It's had me nearly crazy.

1556
01:53:02,289 --> 01:53:04,690
Leonard, who's this girl?

1557
01:53:04,917 --> 01:53:07,523
I'm not this girl, I'm his girl.

1558
01:53:07,753 --> 01:53:09,517
Tell her, Len.

1559
01:53:09,713 --> 01:53:13,081
Leonard, is this the girl who was
with you in the travel bureau?

1560
01:53:13,342 --> 01:53:16,391
The girl you said you hardly knew,
didn't even know her name?

1561
01:53:16,637 --> 01:53:21,120
That's right. That's who I am and I know
all about you. You're not his wife.

1562
01:53:21,434 --> 01:53:25,564
Never have been. You're years older than
he is. We've been together for months

1563
01:53:25,855 --> 01:53:31,544
and we're going away on a cruise, just
like they said in court. Tell her, Len.

1564
01:53:31,902 --> 01:53:36,703
- Yes, Len, tell me yourself.
- All right, Diana, come along.

1565
01:53:37,032 --> 01:53:39,638
You can't, not after what
I've done. I won't let you.

1566
01:53:39,869 --> 01:53:42,713
I saved your life getting
you out of Germany,

1567
01:53:42,955 --> 01:53:46,038
you got me out of this mess,
so we're even. It's over now.

1568
01:53:46,292 --> 01:53:50,661
Don't, Leonard! Don't leave me!
Don't, Leonard! Don't!

1569
01:53:50,963 --> 01:53:53,728
Full yourself together. They'll
have you up for perjury.

1570
01:53:53,966 --> 01:53:58,369
Don't make it worse or they'll
try you as an accessory.

1571
01:53:58,679 --> 01:54:00,886
And you know what that means.

1572
01:54:01,098 --> 01:54:05,581
I don't care. Let them. Let them try me
for perjury, or an accessory, or...

1573
01:54:06,771 --> 01:54:09,342
- Ready?
- Or better yet...

1574
01:54:09,565 --> 01:54:11,488
let them try me for...!

1575
01:54:11,692 --> 01:54:13,456
Argh!

1576
01:54:35,091 --> 01:54:39,460
- Call a doctor.
- It's no use. No doctor can help now.

1577
01:54:40,679 --> 01:54:43,000
- What happened?
- She killed him.

1578
01:54:43,224 --> 01:54:45,147
Killed him?

1579
01:54:45,351 --> 01:54:47,513
She executed him.

1580
01:54:49,230 --> 01:54:51,710
Carter, what have you
done with the luggage?

1581
01:54:51,941 --> 01:54:57,425
I sent it on ahead to the station,
and I've got a cab waiting outside.

1582
01:55:04,203 --> 01:55:08,003
- A remarkable woman.
- You can just barely catch the boat train.

1583
01:55:08,290 --> 01:55:11,931
Better bring the luggage back,
and you can dismiss the cab.

1584
01:55:12,211 --> 01:55:15,181
We are not going yet, are we?

1585
01:55:17,716 --> 01:55:20,481
Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.

1586
01:55:20,719 --> 01:55:23,290
Get Brogan-Moore to my
chambers, and Mayhew too.

1587
01:55:23,514 --> 01:55:27,644
We're appearing for the defence
in the trial of Christine Vole.

1588
01:55:27,935 --> 01:55:29,699
Sir Wilfrid?

1589
01:55:29,895 --> 01:55:32,466
You've forgotten your brandy.

1590
01:55:55,254 --> 01:55:57,097
The management of
this theatre suggests

1591
01:55:57,298 --> 01:56:01,383
that for the greater entertainment of
friends who have not yet seen the picture,

1592
01:56:01,677 --> 01:56:04,726
you will not divulge to anyone
the secret of the ending

1593
01:56:04,972 --> 01:56:07,623
of "Witness For The Prosecution".
