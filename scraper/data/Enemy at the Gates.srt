1
00:01:36,761 --> 00:01:41,014
I am a stone.

2
00:01:41,015 --> 00:01:46,015
I do not move.

3
00:01:48,314 --> 00:01:53,314
Very slowly, I put snow in my mouth.

4
00:01:53,987 --> 00:01:58,987
Then he won't see my breath.

5
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:06,498
I take my time.

6
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:11,499
I let him come closer.
I have only one bullet.

7
00:02:11,796 --> 00:02:16,796
I aim at his eye very gently.
My finger presses on the trigger.

8
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,893
I do not tremble.

9
00:02:26,894 --> 00:02:29,479
I have no fear.

10
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,480
I'm a big boy now.

11
00:02:36,195 --> 00:02:38,864
Ready, Vassili?

12
00:02:38,865 --> 00:02:41,700
Now, Vassili. Fire!

13
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:46,701
Fire, Vassili! Fire!

14
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:46,473
Come on, pick your feet up.

15
00:03:46,474 --> 00:03:51,474
Get on your feet.
Prepare to board the train.

16
00:03:58,194 --> 00:04:03,194
You there, come along with me now.
This way, pal.

17
00:04:04,534 --> 00:04:06,660
All civilians, get out!

18
00:04:06,661 --> 00:04:08,870
Make way, let the civilians off.

19
00:04:08,871 --> 00:04:12,374
This is a military convoy.

20
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:17,375
No one stays on board
but our valiant soldiers.

21
00:04:17,463 --> 00:04:22,463
This is a convoy to Stalingrad.
Only for the soldiers of the Red Army.

22
00:04:30,893 --> 00:04:35,893
No one stays on board
but our valiant soldiers.

23
00:04:45,575 --> 00:04:50,575
All aboard!

24
00:05:13,227 --> 00:05:15,520
Autumn, 1942.

25
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:20,521
Europe lies crushed
beneath the Nazi jackboot.

26
00:05:22,236 --> 00:05:26,198
The German Third Reich
is at the height of its power.

27
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,950
Hitler's armies are charging
through the heart of the Soviet Union

28
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:31,745
towards the oil fields of Asia.

29
00:05:31,746 --> 00:05:34,080
One last obstacle remains.

30
00:05:34,081 --> 00:05:37,501
A city on the Volga where
the fate of the world is being decided.

31
00:05:37,502 --> 00:05:42,502
Stalingrad.

32
00:06:03,486 --> 00:06:06,655
The Red Army and all citizens
of the Soviet Union

33
00:06:06,656 --> 00:06:11,656
must defend every inch of Soviet soil.
Must fight to the last...

34
00:06:30,012 --> 00:06:34,975
Glorious Comrade Stalin has ordered
not another step backwards,

35
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:39,976
so the people of the Soviet Union
shall be free.

36
00:06:54,203 --> 00:06:59,203
Let's go forwards, Comrades.
Not a step backwards.

37
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:21,100
Listen to these letters sent by Russian
mothers to their sons on the front.

38
00:07:22,815 --> 00:07:27,815
Volodya, our child,
I know that it is for our motherland...

39
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:36,407
I know it is for our motherland
that you are giving your life.

40
00:07:51,761 --> 00:07:56,761
Everyone here knows
that you will not fall back.

41
00:07:57,016 --> 00:08:00,352
Everyone here is proud of you.

42
00:08:00,353 --> 00:08:04,022
Your father is dead.
Your brothers are dead.

43
00:08:04,023 --> 00:08:09,023
Avenge us on the hordes of fascists.

44
00:08:46,232 --> 00:08:49,025
Nobody move! Stay on the boat!

45
00:08:49,026 --> 00:08:52,570
Get back or I'll shoot.
Get back from the rails or we'll shoot.

46
00:08:52,571 --> 00:08:57,571
Shoot the traitors!

47
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:21,429
Prepare to disembark!

48
00:09:28,983 --> 00:09:33,983
Come on, come on! Move!

49
00:09:35,448 --> 00:09:39,534
Come on, Comrades. Come on!

50
00:09:39,535 --> 00:09:44,535
Move or you'll be shot!

51
00:09:57,803 --> 00:10:02,803
Over here, stretcher.

52
00:10:05,728 --> 00:10:10,728
- The one with the rifle shoots.
- One out of two gets a rifle.

53
00:10:10,941 --> 00:10:15,941
The one without follows him.
When the one with the rifle gets killed,

54
00:10:18,074 --> 00:10:23,074
the one who is following
picks up the rifle and shoots.

55
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:28,124
The one with the rifle shoots.

56
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:31,836
The one without follows him.

57
00:10:31,837 --> 00:10:35,381
When the one with the rifle gets killed,

58
00:10:35,382 --> 00:10:40,382
the one who is following
picks up the rifle and shoots.

59
00:10:41,472 --> 00:10:46,472
The one with the rifle shoots.

60
00:11:11,085 --> 00:11:14,337
Soldiers of the glorious Red Army,

61
00:11:14,338 --> 00:11:19,338
from now on,
it is either victory or death.

62
00:11:20,052 --> 00:11:21,928
- Those who retreat...
- I need a rifle.

63
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:23,721
- ...will be shot.
- I need a rifle.

64
00:11:23,722 --> 00:11:28,722
There will be no mercy
for cowards and traitors.

65
00:13:18,212 --> 00:13:22,298
It's hopeless, Comrades. Get back.

66
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:24,968
Fall back! Fall back!

67
00:13:24,969 --> 00:13:29,389
It's no good. Get back. Get back.

68
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:34,390
In the name of the Soviet Union,
not a step backwards, or we shoot!

69
00:13:36,397 --> 00:13:40,858
- No retreat. Not a step back.
- No mercy.

70
00:13:40,859 --> 00:13:42,735
Deserters will be shot.

71
00:13:42,736 --> 00:13:47,736
- Fire!
- Fire!

72
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,160
No mercy for cowards.

73
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,826
Russians, surrender.

74
00:14:31,827 --> 00:14:36,827
You will see your home again.
This is not your war.

75
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:41,919
Join your German comrades.
They understand your suffering

76
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,798
and will care more for you
than your own officers,

77
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:50,799
who are only sending you to your death.
The Third Reich is not your enemy.

78
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:57,056
The enemy is bloodthirsty Stalin
and his Bolshevik gang...

79
00:15:23,045 --> 00:15:23,545
Fire!

80
00:17:22,331 --> 00:17:27,331
You'll get us caught,
Comrade Commissar.

81
00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:53,649
With your permission,
Comrade Commissar.

82
00:18:23,934 --> 00:18:26,102
Which one do you think
I should I aim at first?

83
00:18:26,103 --> 00:18:31,103
You should wait till there's an explosion.

84
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:46,910
- Do you know how to shoot?
- A little.

85
00:19:09,438 --> 00:19:09,938
Damn!

86
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:42,466
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
He's looking at us.

87
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:50,409
Thank you, Comrade Commissar.

88
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:59,710
Danilov. Political officer,
second class, 21st infantry.

89
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:24,321
Vassili Zaitsev.

90
00:21:24,322 --> 00:21:29,322
On this day, September 20th, 1942,
a young shepherd boy from the Urals

91
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:38,252
arrived in the city of Stalingrad
on the banks of the Volga.

92
00:21:38,253 --> 00:21:43,253
His name is Vassili Zaitsev.

93
00:21:43,258 --> 00:21:48,258
Like thousands before him, he came
to answer Comrade Stalin's call.

94
00:21:48,805 --> 00:21:52,641
Armed only with a rifle, he quickly
made the fascist invader realize

95
00:21:52,642 --> 00:21:57,642
that from now on he would be punished
for every step he took in the motherland,

96
00:21:57,981 --> 00:22:02,981
that from here on
the only way was back.

97
00:22:04,196 --> 00:22:07,865
What do you think?

98
00:22:07,866 --> 00:22:12,866
I think Comrade Commissar
has been overgenerous.

99
00:22:27,761 --> 00:22:32,761
Let me go!

100
00:22:36,645 --> 00:22:41,645
By order of Comrade Stalin,
no civilian can leave the city.

101
00:22:43,318 --> 00:22:45,194
Get back there!

102
00:22:45,195 --> 00:22:46,904
Move back!

103
00:22:46,905 --> 00:22:51,905
Stand away, or we will open fire.

104
00:23:01,002 --> 00:23:02,253
Stand away!

105
00:23:02,254 --> 00:23:05,881
Keep back!

106
00:23:05,882 --> 00:23:07,383
Get back or we shoot.

107
00:23:07,384 --> 00:23:10,010
Back! Keep back, there!

108
00:23:10,011 --> 00:23:15,011
Make way for Comrade Stalin's envoy.

109
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:23,270
I carried out my orders.
I sent in all of my boys.

110
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,444
But the Germans engulfed us.

111
00:23:27,445 --> 00:23:31,782
They have artillery, aircraft, tanks.

112
00:23:31,783 --> 00:23:36,745
- And me, what did I have?
- A sacred duty to resist.

113
00:23:36,746 --> 00:23:41,125
I have to report to the boss.

114
00:23:41,126 --> 00:23:46,126
Perhaps you would prefer
to avoid the red tape.

115
00:24:07,235 --> 00:24:12,235
My name is
Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev.

116
00:24:15,327 --> 00:24:18,454
I've come to take things in hand here.

117
00:24:18,455 --> 00:24:23,455
This city is not Kursk,
nor is it Kiev, nor Minsk.

118
00:24:26,171 --> 00:24:29,840
This city is Stalingrad.

119
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:33,802
Stalingrad!

120
00:24:33,803 --> 00:24:38,803
This city bears the name of the boss.
It's more than a city, it's a symbol.

121
00:24:40,018 --> 00:24:45,018
If the Germans capture this city,

122
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:49,443
the entire country will collapse.

123
00:24:49,444 --> 00:24:54,444
Now, I want our boys
to raise their heads.

124
00:24:56,868 --> 00:25:00,371
I want them to act like they have balls.

125
00:25:00,372 --> 00:25:05,372
I want them to stop shitting their pants.

126
00:25:07,879 --> 00:25:11,048
That's your job.

127
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:16,049
As political officers,
I'm counting on you.

128
00:25:19,057 --> 00:25:24,057
You, what's your suggestion?

129
00:25:24,062 --> 00:25:29,062
Shoot all the other generals who have
retreated and their chiefs of staff, too.

130
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:33,737
Make some examples.
Deport the families of the deserters...

131
00:25:33,738 --> 00:25:35,948
That's all been done.

132
00:25:35,949 --> 00:25:40,949
Give them hope.

133
00:25:50,422 --> 00:25:54,425
Here, the men's only choice
is between German bullets and ours.

134
00:25:54,426 --> 00:25:57,761
But there's another way,
a way of courage.

135
00:25:57,762 --> 00:26:00,139
A way of love of the motherland.

136
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,475
We must publish the army newspaper
again, we must tell magnificent stories,

137
00:26:03,476 --> 00:26:06,311
stories that exalt sacrifice, bravery.

138
00:26:06,312 --> 00:26:08,814
We must make them believe
in a victory.

139
00:26:08,815 --> 00:26:13,815
We must give them hope, pride,
a desire to fight.

140
00:26:13,903 --> 00:26:15,487
Yes.

141
00:26:15,488 --> 00:26:20,117
We need to make examples,
but examples to follow.

142
00:26:20,118 --> 00:26:25,118
What we need are heroes.

143
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,420
Do you know any heroes around here?

144
00:26:31,421 --> 00:26:36,421
Yes, Comrade. I know one.

145
00:26:41,306 --> 00:26:46,306
That's me. Vassili Zaitsev. That's me.

146
00:26:46,644 --> 00:26:50,355
No, you're not dreaming. It's your name.

147
00:26:50,356 --> 00:26:53,484
We made the front page.

148
00:26:53,485 --> 00:26:56,487
They haven't changed a word.

149
00:26:56,488 --> 00:27:00,115
Do you have any idea what this means?

150
00:27:00,116 --> 00:27:02,493
It's not the back page.
It's not the second page.

151
00:27:02,494 --> 00:27:04,953
- It's the front page. The front page!
- Front page.

152
00:27:04,954 --> 00:27:07,039
They're going to reprint
our article everywhere,

153
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:11,335
in the Caucasus, in the Crimea,
even in the Urals.

154
00:27:11,336 --> 00:27:15,005
Tomorrow morning, Stalin himself
will be sitting over breakfast,

155
00:27:15,006 --> 00:27:18,342
reading my words,
memorizing your name.

156
00:27:18,343 --> 00:27:21,470
We're famous, Vassili.
Khrushchev loved the article.

157
00:27:21,471 --> 00:27:24,014
He's promoted me to the general staff

158
00:27:24,015 --> 00:27:29,015
and you to sniper division.

159
00:27:29,354 --> 00:27:31,063
- Well, that's good.
- It's very good.

160
00:27:31,064 --> 00:27:33,065
- It's very good. It's great!
- It's very great!

161
00:27:33,066 --> 00:27:34,358
- It's great!
- It's great!

162
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:38,195
It's great for both of us
because we did it together. Together.

163
00:27:38,196 --> 00:27:40,239
Well, now, admittedly,
I did all the hard work.

164
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,824
You know, you're very lucky
I can't fight back.

165
00:27:41,825 --> 00:27:43,700
- Why's that?
- Because Khrushchev told me

166
00:27:43,701 --> 00:27:45,035
to make sure nothing happens to you.

167
00:27:45,036 --> 00:27:46,829
- You're too important.
- I'm too valuable.

168
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:50,082
Yes. Careful of my glasses, please,
they're new.

169
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:53,836
Sorry, sir.

170
00:27:53,837 --> 00:27:55,254
- I'm famous.
- I'm famous.

171
00:27:55,255 --> 00:27:56,880
- We're famous.
- I'm famous.

172
00:27:56,881 --> 00:27:59,216
Vassili, the young shepherd
from the Urals,

173
00:27:59,217 --> 00:28:01,009
killed his 12th German officer today.

174
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:03,220
Used to hunt wolves,
now he shoots fascists.

175
00:28:03,221 --> 00:28:05,889
- Today Vassili Zaitsev shot his 23rd...
- One more colonel shot by...

176
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,391
He is an example to us all.

177
00:28:07,392 --> 00:28:12,392
Today Vassili Zaitsev
killed his 32nd general.

178
00:28:12,772 --> 00:28:15,357
Thirty-sixth German officer...

179
00:28:15,358 --> 00:28:19,611
the Germans you have killed?
Today Vassili Zaitsev killed...

180
00:28:19,612 --> 00:28:24,612
eleven dog tags retrieved
by sniper Vassili Zaitsev...

181
00:28:27,954 --> 00:28:29,371
More and more men and women,

182
00:28:29,372 --> 00:28:31,415
fighters from all branches
of our armed forces,

183
00:28:31,416 --> 00:28:36,416
volunteer to join the sniper division
and learn the skills of Vassili Zaitsev.

184
00:28:40,425 --> 00:28:45,425
I am a stone.

185
00:28:45,763 --> 00:28:49,600
I am a stone.

186
00:28:49,601 --> 00:28:54,601
I breathe slowly.

187
00:28:58,902 --> 00:29:03,902
I aim at the eye.

188
00:29:31,017 --> 00:29:33,810
So it is you.

189
00:29:33,811 --> 00:29:37,356
The great Vassili Zaitsev.

190
00:29:37,357 --> 00:29:39,858
My mother makes the best potatoes
and bacon in town.

191
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:41,026
Sounds good.

192
00:29:41,027 --> 00:29:45,614
When she sees you,
she won't believe her eyes.

193
00:29:45,615 --> 00:29:49,993
- How many today?
- Only two.

194
00:29:49,994 --> 00:29:52,496
And the last one,
why didn't you shoot him?

195
00:29:52,497 --> 00:29:57,497
He was only a foot soldier.
It wasn't worth giving away my position.

196
00:29:58,127 --> 00:30:01,380
Bless you.

197
00:30:01,381 --> 00:30:04,383
We know how much we owe you.

198
00:30:04,384 --> 00:30:07,636
We pray for you every day.

199
00:30:07,637 --> 00:30:12,637
Every evening we listen to them
talk about you on Radio Moscow.

200
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:14,559
Thanks.

201
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,061
You've certainly managed well
down here.

202
00:30:16,062 --> 00:30:20,691
My parents used to store furniture
down here before the war.

203
00:30:20,692 --> 00:30:24,027
Sacha, drop that right now.

204
00:30:24,028 --> 00:30:29,028
It's loaded.

205
00:30:34,747 --> 00:30:39,747
- This way, Comrade Commissar.
- Thank you, Comrade.

206
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:45,670
Good evening.

207
00:30:45,758 --> 00:30:50,758
Comrade Zaitsev.

208
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:56,893
My God, where does
all this mail come from?

209
00:30:56,894 --> 00:31:01,690
From all over the country,
Mrs. Filipov, from all over.

210
00:31:01,691 --> 00:31:03,734
This one's from the workers
of the Kuzbass.

211
00:31:03,735 --> 00:31:06,528
They want to name their mine
after Vassili.

212
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:10,407
Right, let's start with the miners.

213
00:31:10,408 --> 00:31:15,408
Come on, let's get to work.

214
00:31:17,623 --> 00:31:20,542
- Dear Comrades from the Kuzbass...
- Kuzbass.

215
00:31:20,543 --> 00:31:23,879
I thank you for your letter of praise.

216
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,880
- Praise?
- R-A-I-S-E.

217
00:31:29,427 --> 00:31:33,055
And

218
00:31:33,056 --> 00:31:36,767
I hope that I can live up
to your expectations.

219
00:31:36,768 --> 00:31:39,603
A-T-I-O-N-S.

220
00:31:39,604 --> 00:31:43,565
Expectations.

221
00:31:43,566 --> 00:31:48,566
You're interested in German literature,
Mrs. Filipov?

222
00:31:48,613 --> 00:31:52,282
It's all right. It's our neighbor.

223
00:31:52,283 --> 00:31:53,617
Right. Where were we?

224
00:31:53,618 --> 00:31:58,618
- Tania, we have guests.
- Expectations. Your offer to name...

225
00:32:08,049 --> 00:32:12,636
I recognize you.

226
00:32:12,637 --> 00:32:17,637
It's Vassili Zaitsev.

227
00:32:18,142 --> 00:32:23,142
I saw your picture in the paper.
Thank you for everything you're doing.

228
00:32:23,898 --> 00:32:28,151
- And this is his friend, Commissar...
- Danilov.

229
00:32:28,152 --> 00:32:30,153
Danilov.

230
00:32:30,154 --> 00:32:31,905
Tania's like a daughter to me.

231
00:32:31,906 --> 00:32:34,908
She used to take care of Sacha
when I worked at the factory.

232
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:38,328
She even taught him German.
All these books are hers.

233
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:41,331
- They're yours?
- She studied German at the university.

234
00:32:41,332 --> 00:32:46,332
- Which university?
- Moscow.

235
00:32:49,173 --> 00:32:49,673
Moscow.

236
00:32:54,345 --> 00:32:59,345
- Shouldn't we...
- Yes, let's continue.

237
00:33:00,268 --> 00:33:05,268
Your offer to name your mine
after me is

238
00:33:06,774 --> 00:33:10,026
a great honor.

239
00:33:10,027 --> 00:33:10,527
H-O-N.

240
00:33:14,031 --> 00:33:18,702
- Yes, I know, honor.
- Very good.

241
00:33:18,703 --> 00:33:23,703
Shouldn't we try and make the point
that I'm not the only one fighting?

242
00:33:25,418 --> 00:33:28,587
That's an excellent idea, Vassili.
Excellent.

243
00:33:28,588 --> 00:33:32,215
We can take it even further, though.
Yeah, we can take it further.

244
00:33:32,216 --> 00:33:37,216
Your battle for the production of coal
is as worthy as mine.

245
00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:45,228
There's no "K" in coal.

246
00:33:45,229 --> 00:33:48,148
Just one

247
00:33:48,149 --> 00:33:50,066
That's it.

248
00:33:50,067 --> 00:33:52,611
Tell me if I'm going too fast.

249
00:33:52,612 --> 00:33:54,738
- No, you're not going too fast.
- Are you sure?

250
00:33:54,739 --> 00:33:57,824
I just thought...
ls there any other improvements?

251
00:33:57,825 --> 00:34:02,078
Why don't you get some rest?
These letters can wait until tomorrow.

252
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:06,082
We should carry on. We're not tired.
Thank you, Mrs. Filipov.

253
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:10,962
These people took the trouble
to write to us.

254
00:34:10,963 --> 00:34:15,963
Tomorrow, we may not be around
to write back.

255
00:35:48,936 --> 00:35:53,936
I was expecting someone else.

256
00:35:54,191 --> 00:35:58,695
Certainly not someone so prestigious.
I imagine you have your reasons

257
00:35:58,696 --> 00:36:03,696
for getting yourself involved
in this hellish situation.

258
00:36:06,287 --> 00:36:10,081
My army is not designed
for this kind of fighting.

259
00:36:10,082 --> 00:36:13,376
Yesterday, yet again,
I had to promote 25 sergeants

260
00:36:13,377 --> 00:36:18,214
to replace the officers shot down
by their sharpshooters.

261
00:36:18,215 --> 00:36:22,719
Those snipers are demoralizing
my people.

262
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,720
This city is no more
than a heap of ruins.

263
00:36:30,728 --> 00:36:34,105
But the fuhrer's persisting.

264
00:36:34,106 --> 00:36:39,106
He has made it a personal matter
between Stalin and himself.

265
00:36:43,616 --> 00:36:47,243
We should trust the Fuhrer's instinct.

266
00:36:47,244 --> 00:36:52,244
He always managed
to lead us to victory.

267
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:57,833
We shall be back home for Christmas.

268
00:36:59,465 --> 00:37:04,465
How are you going to go about
finding this young Russian?

269
00:37:04,762 --> 00:37:09,762
I'll fix it so that he's the one
who finds me.

270
00:37:10,476 --> 00:37:13,603
Vassili! Vassili!

271
00:37:13,604 --> 00:37:16,481
- Come on! Time to get up.
- What?

272
00:37:16,482 --> 00:37:18,191
They have a problem in the
department store sector.

273
00:37:18,192 --> 00:37:23,192
They need us. Come on.

274
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:34,870
Look, Vassili, he's hiding
in the department store, over there.

275
00:37:39,547 --> 00:37:44,547
So far this morning, he's knocked off
five officers plus two machine gunners.

276
00:37:47,304 --> 00:37:50,473
Look! Third floor.

277
00:37:50,474 --> 00:37:55,474
- Fourth window from the left.
- Fourth window from the left.

278
00:37:59,316 --> 00:38:01,735
See him?

279
00:38:01,736 --> 00:38:06,736
Yeah, I see him.

280
00:38:15,499 --> 00:38:20,499
- There, you got him!
- Great shot.

281
00:38:23,174 --> 00:38:28,174
Let's go get his dog tag.

282
00:38:29,847 --> 00:38:31,431
Goodbye, Comrade Commissar.

283
00:38:31,432 --> 00:38:36,432
Thank you for your hospitality,
Mrs. Filipov.

284
00:38:44,028 --> 00:38:45,403
You can borrow whatever you like.

285
00:38:45,404 --> 00:38:48,865
I'm not sure what they would say
to me at headquarters

286
00:38:48,866 --> 00:38:52,368
if I came back with an armful
of Goethe and Schiller.

287
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:55,079
There's some Marx, too.

288
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,874
You were assigned to civil defense
at the 12th district?

289
00:38:57,875 --> 00:39:00,627
No, I volunteered.

290
00:39:00,628 --> 00:39:03,087
It's such a coincidence
meeting you like this.

291
00:39:03,088 --> 00:39:05,131
Comrade Khrushchev was telling me
just yesterday

292
00:39:05,132 --> 00:39:08,051
how desperately we're in need
of operators who speak German.

293
00:39:08,052 --> 00:39:12,388
I can't. Our militia is responsible for
all the people in this neighborhood.

294
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:13,723
We're already desperately short of men.

295
00:39:13,724 --> 00:39:14,891
We can take care of that.

296
00:39:14,892 --> 00:39:17,101
We'll give you a dozen soldiers
for every one that speaks German.

297
00:39:17,102 --> 00:39:18,895
I'd rather stay and fight.

298
00:39:18,896 --> 00:39:23,896
Serving the headquarters is fighting.
You'd be far more useful there.

299
00:39:24,652 --> 00:39:26,444
You stay here. You cover us.

300
00:39:26,445 --> 00:39:31,241
- All right.
- We go.

301
00:39:31,242 --> 00:39:36,242
Take care.

302
00:39:37,414 --> 00:39:42,414
Ludmilla, come on.

303
00:40:31,135 --> 00:40:36,135
Take the stairway.

304
00:42:22,955 --> 00:42:27,955
- It's a trap.
- I know.

305
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:56,650
Move back.

306
00:43:42,284 --> 00:43:47,284
He's still here.

307
00:44:07,434 --> 00:44:12,434
- They're coming straight for us.
- Ludmilla, stay where you are.

308
00:44:12,689 --> 00:44:17,689
He's over there somewhere.

309
00:44:26,036 --> 00:44:30,248
We have to get out of here!

310
00:44:30,249 --> 00:44:35,249
- We have to get out of here!
- Just stay where you are!

311
00:44:37,756 --> 00:44:42,756
- What are we gonna do?
- Ludmilla, stay where you are!

312
00:44:53,313 --> 00:44:57,650
Fuck this, I'm going.

313
00:44:57,651 --> 00:45:02,651
Ludmilla, no!

314
00:45:52,789 --> 00:45:56,375
What does this mean?

315
00:45:56,376 --> 00:45:59,378
"A little shepherd from the Urals
receives a new sniper's rifle.

316
00:45:59,379 --> 00:46:04,133
"A Mosin Nagant 7.62,
with its 3.5-power PU telescope,

317
00:46:04,134 --> 00:46:07,970
"pride of precision of Soviet production."

318
00:46:07,971 --> 00:46:10,473
- I've seen that rifle close up.
- Have you?

319
00:46:10,474 --> 00:46:12,767
I even touched it.

320
00:46:12,768 --> 00:46:17,768
I know him well, Vassili Zaitsev.

321
00:47:04,861 --> 00:47:08,614
Ludmilla and Anton were killed today.

322
00:47:08,615 --> 00:47:11,993
- And it was my fault.
- No. I'm sure that's not true.

323
00:47:11,994 --> 00:47:14,954
There was a German sniper.

324
00:47:14,955 --> 00:47:18,332
I walked them right into his trap.

325
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:21,002
- What else can you tell me?
- He didn't relocate.

326
00:47:21,003 --> 00:47:26,003
A sniper who doesn't relocate
isn't normal.

327
00:47:27,509 --> 00:47:29,218
He was very good.

328
00:47:29,219 --> 00:47:33,889
It wasn't just his shooting,
it was his instinct.

329
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:36,809
He was a step ahead of me all the time.

330
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:40,396
That's because
he knows everything about you.

331
00:47:40,397 --> 00:47:45,397
His name is Konig. Major Konig.
They've sent him here to...

332
00:47:48,697 --> 00:47:53,697
To find you.

333
00:47:58,165 --> 00:48:00,374
At first, we weren't sure
if the information was reliable.

334
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:03,502
It seems he's come all the way
from Berlin to stop you.

335
00:48:03,503 --> 00:48:04,837
You've caused them
so many sleepless nights,

336
00:48:04,838 --> 00:48:06,172
they've sent their top marksman
after you.

337
00:48:06,173 --> 00:48:11,173
- So, what do we know about him?
- He's a major in the Wehrmacht.

338
00:48:12,054 --> 00:48:15,264
He's director of their sniper school
in Zossen.

339
00:48:15,265 --> 00:48:18,768
Koulikov studied under him
at Zossen before the war.

340
00:48:18,769 --> 00:48:23,769
He knows all his tricks. From now on
he'll go with you everywhere.

341
00:48:24,274 --> 00:48:27,360
A nobleman from Bavaria
who hunts deer

342
00:48:27,361 --> 00:48:30,696
against the shepherd boy from the Urals
who poaches wolves.

343
00:48:30,697 --> 00:48:35,697
It's more than a confrontation
between two nations.

344
00:48:37,454 --> 00:48:40,581
It's the essence of class struggle.

345
00:48:40,582 --> 00:48:43,709
I'm glad you're so happy.

346
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:47,797
He had all the advantages.
Next time you'll be even.

347
00:48:47,798 --> 00:48:52,798
No one shoots like you, Vassili.

348
00:48:59,267 --> 00:49:03,479
She's been transferred.

349
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:08,480
I'll see if they're ready
for you next door.

350
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,487
Hello.

351
00:49:11,488 --> 00:49:15,324
You look very smart
in your new uniform.

352
00:49:15,325 --> 00:49:18,953
Make sure they don't take it back
once you've finished.

353
00:49:18,954 --> 00:49:23,954
They probably will.

354
00:49:24,418 --> 00:49:28,087
I've heard the rumor
about the German.

355
00:49:28,088 --> 00:49:32,133
- And I wanted to wish you luck.
- Thank you. I'll need it.

356
00:49:32,134 --> 00:49:37,134
From what Comrade Danilov tells me,
you're going to win.

357
00:49:42,018 --> 00:49:44,687
It's time.

358
00:49:44,688 --> 00:49:45,855
Vassili?

359
00:49:45,856 --> 00:49:49,984
- Vassili? Vassili?
- Come to my arms.

360
00:49:49,985 --> 00:49:54,864
Look in my direction, here.
Here, Vassili.

361
00:49:54,865 --> 00:49:56,699
Put your cap back on.
You'll look more heroic.

362
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,201
- This way, Comrade Zaitsev.
- I love this little fellow.

363
00:49:59,202 --> 00:50:01,662
Vassili, is it true that
you volunteered for the front?

364
00:50:01,663 --> 00:50:02,997
- Vassili?
- Vassili?

365
00:50:02,998 --> 00:50:04,123
How old are you, Vassili?

366
00:50:04,124 --> 00:50:05,958
Do you know what this duel
means for our country?

367
00:50:05,959 --> 00:50:08,043
Is it true you killed your first wolf
when you were five?

368
00:50:08,044 --> 00:50:09,962
Vassili, tell us, how many fascists
have you killed today?

369
00:50:09,963 --> 00:50:12,339
Are you proud to be challenged
by the best sharpshooter in Germany?

370
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,301
It's a sign the Germans
are starting to shit their pants.

371
00:50:15,302 --> 00:50:18,471
Go on, my boy, tell us
how are you going to deal with him?

372
00:50:18,472 --> 00:50:20,389
- Or rather, no.
- One more question, please.

373
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:22,683
Tell it to the boss.

374
00:50:22,684 --> 00:50:27,684
He likes good hunting stories.

375
00:50:31,067 --> 00:50:36,067
Look at him with pride,
because he's looking at you.

376
00:50:36,698 --> 00:50:41,698
The whole country is looking at you.

377
00:51:02,098 --> 00:51:07,098
Forgive me, forgive me, Grandfather.

378
00:51:38,426 --> 00:51:43,426
So it's not the wolf that chooses
the hunting ground, but the hunter.

379
00:51:47,394 --> 00:51:52,394
And I'm sure your grandfather
taught you that.

380
00:51:54,401 --> 00:51:59,401
Except, in this case, I'm the game.

381
00:52:03,118 --> 00:52:08,118
However, today what we're going to do
is lure the wolf out of his lair

382
00:52:08,331 --> 00:52:13,331
to where we want him to be.

383
00:52:50,665 --> 00:52:53,792
You're the one whose life is valuable,
you go first.

384
00:52:53,793 --> 00:52:56,003
No. No. We take it in turns.

385
00:52:56,004 --> 00:53:01,004
Next time it's your turn to go first.
And then it's you, Volodya.

386
00:53:16,232 --> 00:53:21,232
Son of a bitch!

387
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:27,530
These are new pants. I just took them
off a captain from the 251st yesterday.

388
00:53:32,248 --> 00:53:36,251
Sixteen months I spent in Germany
at the school in Zossen.

389
00:53:36,252 --> 00:53:40,172
Of course, those were the days
when we were friends with the Krauts.

390
00:53:40,173 --> 00:53:45,173
When our Joseph and their Adolf
were walking hand in hand.

391
00:53:48,765 --> 00:53:53,765
From here to the wire,
160 meters, right?

392
00:53:57,273 --> 00:54:00,275
- Hundred and fifty-five.
- Whatever.

393
00:54:00,276 --> 00:54:03,779
That'll make them send out a repair guy.

394
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:08,780
Let's relocate.

395
00:54:26,803 --> 00:54:31,803
Hey, Volodya.

396
00:54:38,815 --> 00:54:43,815
After the Germans invaded us, it wasn't
the same atmosphere anymore.

397
00:54:45,613 --> 00:54:48,490
They threw my arse in prison.

398
00:54:48,491 --> 00:54:51,243
"What were you doing in Germany?"

399
00:54:51,244 --> 00:54:56,081
"Excuse me," says I, "but it was
Comrade Stalin who sent me there."

400
00:54:56,082 --> 00:55:00,669
"Don't bring our glorious leader
into your treachery.

401
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:03,922
"Confess, spy bastard, confess."

402
00:55:03,923 --> 00:55:08,923
And bang! Bang, bang, bang!

403
00:55:11,681 --> 00:55:15,017
Well, there wasn't a sickle,
but there was a hammer.

404
00:55:15,018 --> 00:55:20,018
And bang, it knocked out all my teeth.

405
00:55:22,108 --> 00:55:25,152
That's right, boy, have no illusions.

406
00:55:25,153 --> 00:55:30,153
That's the land of socialism
and universal bliss for you.

407
00:55:32,535 --> 00:55:37,498
Hey, it's your repair guy.

408
00:55:37,499 --> 00:55:42,499
I got him.

409
00:55:53,515 --> 00:55:57,893
- It's about soup time, isn't it?
- I'm going.

410
00:55:57,894 --> 00:56:00,979
Well, get a move on, Volodya.

411
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:05,980
And try not to spill it all
on your way back, you Marxist bastard.

412
00:56:18,748 --> 00:56:20,415
Here's the enemy sniper activity

413
00:56:20,416 --> 00:56:25,416
reported during
the past 24 hours, Major.

414
00:56:26,297 --> 00:56:29,091
Two sentries shot
in the train station sector,

415
00:56:29,092 --> 00:56:31,927
one artillery observer
in the northern sector,

416
00:56:31,928 --> 00:56:35,973
one lieutenant from the 24th panzer
division in the factory sector,

417
00:56:35,974 --> 00:56:39,142
three telephone repair men
in the workers' housing sector.

418
00:56:39,143 --> 00:56:43,814
They also tell me we've just taken
a prisoner who may interest you.

419
00:56:43,815 --> 00:56:48,110
- I hope he's still able to speak.
- Excuse me, sir?

420
00:56:48,111 --> 00:56:52,948
Nothing. Thank you.

421
00:56:52,949 --> 00:56:55,951
So tell us, Volodya.

422
00:56:55,952 --> 00:57:00,952
Which building is he in?

423
00:57:00,957 --> 00:57:04,793
There is no way I know that.

424
00:57:04,794 --> 00:57:07,337
He moves around all the time.

425
00:57:07,338 --> 00:57:12,175
- He jumps from one to the next.
- On which floor?

426
00:57:12,176 --> 00:57:17,176
- I don't know.
- We'll see about that.

427
00:57:17,265 --> 00:57:19,892
Undress him.

428
00:57:19,893 --> 00:57:24,893
Put him in one of our uniforms.

429
00:57:50,632 --> 00:57:54,134
You see? They're stubborn.

430
00:57:54,135 --> 00:57:57,179
That's the good thing
about the Germans.

431
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:02,180
Man, you got to admit,
when they get an idea in their heads...

432
00:58:16,574 --> 00:58:18,742
Right.

433
00:58:18,743 --> 00:58:23,743
- Let's see if our customer has arrived.
- You ready?

434
00:58:26,125 --> 00:58:30,003
And now, our famous shepherd
from the Urals

435
00:58:30,004 --> 00:58:35,004
who Major Konig thinks is an idiot, gets
up to make sure he has hit his target.

436
00:58:35,969 --> 00:58:40,969
Major Konig sees him,

437
00:58:42,016 --> 00:58:44,768
aims for his helmet,

438
00:58:44,769 --> 00:58:49,064
fires, reveals his position,

439
00:58:49,065 --> 00:58:54,065
and is shot in turn.

440
00:59:01,828 --> 00:59:06,828
Except Major Konig doesn't fire,

441
00:59:09,669 --> 00:59:14,669
because Major Konig isn't there.

442
00:59:16,134 --> 00:59:16,746
Koulikov?

443
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:27,519
Don't you think that was strange?
That last one?

444
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,106
They sent him out
to get shot like the others.

445
00:59:31,107 --> 00:59:32,816
It's not natural.

446
00:59:32,817 --> 00:59:37,817
Not without artillery,
without trying to cover him.

447
00:59:38,364 --> 00:59:41,700
No. No, I'm the one who was stupid.

448
00:59:41,701 --> 00:59:44,119
They don't give a shit
about telephone guys.

449
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,663
I mean, it's like us with the Ukrainians.

450
00:59:46,664 --> 00:59:50,500
They'd never bother a major
over a few dead grunts.

451
00:59:50,501 --> 00:59:55,501
Tomorrow, we'll kill us some generals.

452
01:00:03,723 --> 01:00:06,641
Whose turn is it?

453
01:00:06,642 --> 01:00:09,728
Mine, I think.

454
01:00:09,729 --> 01:00:13,190
You're such a cheater.

455
01:00:13,191 --> 01:00:18,191
You can't fool Papa Koulikov.
No, no, no. It's my turn to go first.

456
01:00:21,908 --> 01:00:26,908
And it's your turn
to get a hole in your breeches.

457
01:01:40,903 --> 01:01:45,903
To victory.

458
01:01:50,413 --> 01:01:54,916
This sniper business
has been dragging on too long.

459
01:01:54,917 --> 01:01:59,880
What's that little fellow of yours up to?

460
01:01:59,881 --> 01:02:02,257
He's probing, Comrade Khrushchev.

461
01:02:02,258 --> 01:02:04,718
He's testing the German
for weaknesses.

462
01:02:04,719 --> 01:02:09,389
He's meticulous in his preparation.

463
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:14,390
Vodka is a luxury we have.

464
01:02:14,437 --> 01:02:17,689
Caviar is a luxury we have.

465
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:20,692
Time is not.

466
01:02:20,693 --> 01:02:25,693
He's aware of that,
Comrade Khrushchev, we both are.

467
01:02:26,032 --> 01:02:28,200
I assure you he will succeed.

468
01:02:28,201 --> 01:02:33,201
Good. it seems your destinies
are entwined.

469
01:02:56,312 --> 01:03:01,312
They're keeping you busy?

470
01:03:03,736 --> 01:03:07,030
I picked this up from the kitchen.
It's from the reception the other day.

471
01:03:07,031 --> 01:03:11,660
I thought Mrs. Filipov might like it.

472
01:03:11,661 --> 01:03:14,579
She'll be thrilled.
That's very sweet of you.

473
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:18,166
There's plenty more if you're hungry.

474
01:03:18,167 --> 01:03:20,835
You're Jewish, aren't you?

475
01:03:20,836 --> 01:03:25,715
There's nothing in our religion
that says you can't eat sturgeon.

476
01:03:25,716 --> 01:03:29,719
My father had a premonition
all this would happen.

477
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,013
You mean the war?

478
01:03:32,014 --> 01:03:35,892
He understood
that the hatred of the Jews ran deep.

479
01:03:35,893 --> 01:03:40,188
He was saving up
to buy some land in Palestine.

480
01:03:40,189 --> 01:03:44,567
He said it was the only land
that we truly belonged in.

481
01:03:44,568 --> 01:03:48,530
The only land we had a duty to defend.

482
01:03:48,531 --> 01:03:52,617
He insisted I learn to use a rifle.

483
01:03:52,618 --> 01:03:57,618
I learn to shoot.

484
01:03:58,624 --> 01:04:03,624
I know that in times of war
personal feelings should be put aside,

485
01:04:03,879 --> 01:04:08,717
- but I have a favor to ask you.
- Of course. Anything you want.

486
01:04:08,718 --> 01:04:13,718
I want to be reassigned.

487
01:04:13,723 --> 01:04:18,723
What's happened, Tania?

488
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:45,958
He shot him.

489
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:51,176
He shot him even though
he jumped first.

490
01:04:51,177 --> 01:04:53,678
Shot him on the run.

491
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:58,141
It was an impossible shot.
I've never seen anything like it.

492
01:04:58,142 --> 01:05:03,142
You've promised people
a victory I can't deliver.

493
01:05:03,439 --> 01:05:06,107
I don't stand a chance against this man.

494
01:05:06,108 --> 01:05:09,778
You mustn't talk like that, Vassili.

495
01:05:09,779 --> 01:05:13,615
What if I told you we've found
a way to track his movements?

496
01:05:13,616 --> 01:05:15,950
We've got someone, Vassili.

497
01:05:15,951 --> 01:05:18,953
Someone close to him
passing us information.

498
01:05:18,954 --> 01:05:23,954
Next time you will be
one step ahead of him.

499
01:05:24,126 --> 01:05:29,126
I promise.

500
01:05:35,888 --> 01:05:39,140
Now I have a favor to ask.

501
01:05:39,141 --> 01:05:39,685
From me?

502
01:05:43,979 --> 01:05:48,979
It's about Tania.

503
01:05:51,237 --> 01:05:51,781
Come in.

504
01:05:58,411 --> 01:06:00,412
He doesn't even know you exist,

505
01:06:00,413 --> 01:06:04,082
but at that moment you're closer to him
than anyone else on Earth.

506
01:06:04,083 --> 01:06:07,377
You see his face through the sight.

507
01:06:07,378 --> 01:06:09,838
You see whether
he shaved that morning or not.

508
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:11,339
You can see whether he's married by,

509
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:16,010
you know, whether
he has a wedding ring on.

510
01:06:16,011 --> 01:06:21,011
It's not like just firing at a distant shape.
It's not just a uniform. It's a man's face.

511
01:06:24,603 --> 01:06:28,189
Those faces don't go away.

512
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:33,190
They come back
and they get replaced by more faces.

513
01:06:33,863 --> 01:06:36,865
Did Danilov ask you to tell me this?

514
01:06:36,866 --> 01:06:40,910
He likes you very much. I think
he'd try anything to change your mind.

515
01:06:40,911 --> 01:06:43,705
Did he tell you why
I asked for the transfer?

516
01:06:43,706 --> 01:06:45,081
No.

517
01:06:45,082 --> 01:06:48,543
This morning a list arrived
at headquarters.

518
01:06:48,544 --> 01:06:51,963
It was a list of civilians
who'd been rounded up

519
01:06:51,964 --> 01:06:56,964
and sent to Germany in a convoy
that left Stalingrad three weeks ago.

520
01:06:58,262 --> 01:07:02,724
My parents were amongst them.

521
01:07:02,725 --> 01:07:04,434
After 30 kilometers,

522
01:07:04,435 --> 01:07:09,435
the German soldiers stopped the train
and forced everyone out.

523
01:07:13,068 --> 01:07:17,572
In the middle of a bridge,
they bound them together,

524
01:07:17,573 --> 01:07:20,533
two by two.

525
01:07:20,534 --> 01:07:23,077
Mothers with daughters.

526
01:07:23,078 --> 01:07:27,123
Husbands and wives.

527
01:07:27,124 --> 01:07:31,294
They lined them up against the railing.

528
01:07:31,295 --> 01:07:36,295
And then they fired a single shot
at each pair to save bullets.

529
01:07:37,843 --> 01:07:40,637
It worked.

530
01:07:40,638 --> 01:07:45,638
The bodies of the ones who died
dragged the others under the water.

531
01:07:48,771 --> 01:07:52,065
I know they died together.

532
01:07:52,066 --> 01:07:57,066
They would never have let themselves
be separated.

533
01:08:10,209 --> 01:08:15,209
That's Koulikov's rifle. It's a good rifle.

534
01:08:23,556 --> 01:08:28,556
Thank you.

535
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:59,420
I know how he leaves the shelter.
He goes through the tractor factory.

536
01:08:59,425 --> 01:09:04,425
The tractor factory is big.

537
01:09:05,055 --> 01:09:06,472
I know exactly where.

538
01:09:06,473 --> 01:09:10,893
He crawls through a gutter
under a grate where the vats are.

539
01:09:10,894 --> 01:09:13,521
Then he goes out from the workshop.

540
01:09:13,522 --> 01:09:15,982
In between the two
there's a place where he's in the open.

541
01:09:15,983 --> 01:09:20,983
It's under a long iron foot walk.

542
01:09:53,062 --> 01:09:58,062
Good luck, Comrade.

543
01:11:40,085 --> 01:11:45,085
I know exactly
where he's waiting for me.

544
01:11:46,008 --> 01:11:51,008
He'll be on the foot walk over the gutter.
We'll take him out from behind.

545
01:12:11,158 --> 01:12:16,158
We'll get to the other end of
the workshop through these pipes.

546
01:12:16,622 --> 01:12:21,622
Follow me.

547
01:14:04,605 --> 01:14:09,605
- You go that way. I'll go around this way.
- Okay.

548
01:14:25,959 --> 01:14:26,459
Shit!

549
01:14:35,385 --> 01:14:38,971
- It's okay.
- You should go back.

550
01:14:38,972 --> 01:14:40,890
- No.
- Go back.

551
01:14:40,891 --> 01:14:45,891
- I'll be all right.
- No, you go!

552
01:14:48,899 --> 01:14:53,899
Keep your legs in.

553
01:15:33,694 --> 01:15:38,694
Come on. Come on. Come on.

554
01:16:36,965 --> 01:16:40,801
Comrade Stalin is asking
for one last effort.

555
01:16:40,802 --> 01:16:42,803
The fate of the motherland is at risk.

556
01:16:42,804 --> 01:16:45,473
The fate of all those
you love and cherish.

557
01:16:45,474 --> 01:16:49,310
It's for them that we fight today.

558
01:16:49,311 --> 01:16:53,647
Listen to me, Tania. The Germans
are throwing everything at us.

559
01:16:53,648 --> 01:16:56,984
If they're lucky, one in ten of these
soldiers will come back alive.

560
01:16:56,985 --> 01:16:59,653
You're highly educated.
You know languages.

561
01:16:59,654 --> 01:17:03,115
Every intercept you translate
saves hundreds of lives.

562
01:17:03,116 --> 01:17:07,119
Every message you decode
kills thousands of theirs.

563
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,497
You have a duty to survive.

564
01:17:09,498 --> 01:17:12,166
Vassili was born to fire a gun.
That's what he knows.

565
01:17:12,167 --> 01:17:16,170
You and I were born
for a different purpose.

566
01:17:16,171 --> 01:17:21,171
If Vassili were here,
he would tell you the same thing.

567
01:17:22,302 --> 01:17:27,302
Where is he? Where's Vassili?

568
01:18:32,747 --> 01:18:34,248
Keep your head down.

569
01:18:34,249 --> 01:18:36,250
- Tell me where he is.
- Stay into that pipe.

570
01:18:36,251 --> 01:18:41,251
Tania, stay in. Stay in. Get your head in.

571
01:18:46,928 --> 01:18:49,263
Slow down.

572
01:18:49,264 --> 01:18:54,264
Don't shoot.

573
01:18:56,938 --> 01:19:01,938
He's over there.

574
01:19:11,286 --> 01:19:16,286
You see the pillar in front of you?

575
01:19:16,291 --> 01:19:21,291
I need you to move round behind it.

576
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:32,306
Go!

577
01:19:32,307 --> 01:19:37,307
Tania, I need you to find
a large piece of glass.

578
01:19:38,313 --> 01:19:43,108
Piece of glass.

579
01:19:43,109 --> 01:19:46,487
You see the kiln?

580
01:19:46,488 --> 01:19:51,488
Behind me, to the left of the factory.

581
01:19:52,494 --> 01:19:55,371
- Yes? I can't hear you.
- Yes.

582
01:19:55,372 --> 01:19:57,623
Yes.

583
01:19:57,624 --> 01:20:02,624
Do you see the two louvers?

584
01:20:03,838 --> 01:20:05,005
Yes.

585
01:20:05,006 --> 01:20:10,006
Do you see the one
with the broken slat?

586
01:20:10,345 --> 01:20:15,345
- Yes.
- This is what I want you to do.

587
01:20:21,398 --> 01:20:24,650
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

588
01:20:24,651 --> 01:20:29,651
Three, two, one.

589
01:20:47,090 --> 01:20:52,090
Hello, Sacha.

590
01:20:55,724 --> 01:20:59,226
He was right where you said he'd be.

591
01:20:59,227 --> 01:21:04,227
Nearly there.

592
01:21:04,774 --> 01:21:09,774
He's very clever.

593
01:21:11,698 --> 01:21:16,698
Tell me about him.

594
01:21:20,123 --> 01:21:24,960
Why was it his grandfather who taught
him how to shoot and not his father?

595
01:21:24,961 --> 01:21:29,961
His father's dead. His mother, too.

596
01:21:31,551 --> 01:21:36,551
- Does he talk about his father?
- No, he didn't know him.

597
01:21:38,141 --> 01:21:40,059
Did he go to school?

598
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:45,060
He knows how to write.
He answers lots of letters.

599
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:49,610
- Is it girls who write to him?
- Everyone writes to him.

600
01:21:49,611 --> 01:21:51,820
And is there a girl
he loves in his village?

601
01:21:51,821 --> 01:21:55,949
- Not in his village. Here!
- Does she love him?

602
01:21:55,950 --> 01:22:00,245
Yes. Because he's handsome,
because he's brave.

603
01:22:00,246 --> 01:22:01,955
And she's very beautiful.

604
01:22:01,956 --> 01:22:04,166
I know her well.
She's from my neighborhood.

605
01:22:04,167 --> 01:22:07,795
She went to the university.
They are handsome together.

606
01:22:07,796 --> 01:22:12,796
Later the two of them will get married.

607
01:22:15,678 --> 01:22:19,681
At least, I think so.

608
01:22:19,682 --> 01:22:24,682
And you, Sacha,
why are you helping the Germans?

609
01:22:28,858 --> 01:22:32,653
Because they're stronger.
Because they're going to win the war.

610
01:22:32,654 --> 01:22:37,654
And because you like chocolate.

611
01:22:52,173 --> 01:22:55,134
All these people here
know they're gonna die,

612
01:22:55,135 --> 01:23:00,135
so each night
when they make it back, it's a bonus.

613
01:23:01,141 --> 01:23:03,976
Excuse me!

614
01:23:03,977 --> 01:23:08,977
So every cup of tea, every cigarette,

615
01:23:09,566 --> 01:23:11,859
becomes a little celebration.

616
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:16,530
Because for a lot of us,
it may be our last night.

617
01:23:16,531 --> 01:23:21,034
It's just something
you have to accept here.

618
01:23:21,035 --> 01:23:26,035
Everyone has their time.

619
01:23:26,541 --> 01:23:31,420
In the forest,
the wolf lives for three years,

620
01:23:31,421 --> 01:23:36,421
the donkey for nine.

621
01:23:36,426 --> 01:23:40,053
Sorry, but that's got to be
a proverb from the Urals.

622
01:23:40,054 --> 01:23:42,181
It makes no sense to me whatsoever!

623
01:23:42,182 --> 01:23:46,393
The donkey lives longer
because he's more useful.

624
01:23:46,394 --> 01:23:47,561
It makes absolute sense.

625
01:23:47,562 --> 01:23:52,562
There aren't any donkeys in the forest.
You made it up.

626
01:23:53,234 --> 01:23:56,320
So,

627
01:23:56,321 --> 01:24:01,116
I'm a donkey.

628
01:24:01,117 --> 01:24:06,117
People like you and Danilov
have to survive this.

629
01:24:06,289 --> 01:24:11,251
People who've read books,
had an education.

630
01:24:11,252 --> 01:24:16,252
- We'll need you when the war's over.
- And if you survive?

631
01:24:16,341 --> 01:24:20,636
What will the useless
Vassili Zaitsev do then?

632
01:24:20,637 --> 01:24:23,931
I want to work in a factory.

633
01:24:23,932 --> 01:24:28,519
My granddad took me to a factory once.

634
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:33,520
There was this man there
high up on a foot walk.

635
01:24:35,777 --> 01:24:39,029
He wasn't wearing blue like the others.

636
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:42,449
The people he was supervising over,
they didn't really understand

637
01:24:42,450 --> 01:24:45,452
what they were doing,
but for him up there

638
01:24:45,453 --> 01:24:48,330
it was simple, it was clear.

639
01:24:48,331 --> 01:24:53,331
And I thought,
"One day, I could be that man."

640
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:04,300
Sad to have a dream
you know won't happen.

641
01:25:04,556 --> 01:25:08,976
Why shouldn't it?

642
01:25:08,977 --> 01:25:12,854
You'll outlive us all.

643
01:25:12,855 --> 01:25:17,855
You'll be the oldest donkey in the forest.

644
01:25:32,750 --> 01:25:35,919
One hundred and fifty meters stand
between the Germans and the Volga.

645
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:37,921
Today the whole world is watching
these 150 meters.

646
01:25:37,922 --> 01:25:42,922
They are
what make Stalingrad the capital

647
01:25:43,553 --> 01:25:48,553
of the war.

648
01:25:50,435 --> 01:25:54,354
Your friend, Tania.

649
01:25:54,355 --> 01:25:56,523
Have you seen her?

650
01:25:56,524 --> 01:26:00,360
She stays over there now
with the snipers.

651
01:26:00,361 --> 01:26:02,404
Tell the major we're sending in
all our sharpshooters

652
01:26:02,405 --> 01:26:07,405
to support the attack on the factory.

653
01:26:08,411 --> 01:26:13,411
Tell him Vassili will be there.

654
01:30:01,394 --> 01:30:06,394
- I need to talk to you.
- Sure.

655
01:30:08,484 --> 01:30:09,028
Danilov.

656
01:30:23,082 --> 01:30:28,082
You have to stop writing about me.

657
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:31,882
I'm not gonna get him
because I'm not good enough.

658
01:30:31,883 --> 01:30:35,594
Sooner or later he's gonna find me,
he's gonna kill me.

659
01:30:35,595 --> 01:30:40,265
I've warned you before
not to talk like this.

660
01:30:40,266 --> 01:30:44,936
This time it's different.

661
01:30:44,937 --> 01:30:49,937
You've built me up and up
into someone I'm not.

662
01:30:52,278 --> 01:30:56,656
I can't carry that weight anymore.
I want to fight.

663
01:30:56,657 --> 01:31:01,536
I want to fight just as a regular soldier.

664
01:31:01,537 --> 01:31:03,246
I understand.

665
01:31:03,247 --> 01:31:05,749
The thing is, Vassili,
you're not a regular soldier,

666
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:10,750
- you're an extraordinary soldier.
- No. I'm what you've made me.

667
01:31:11,088 --> 01:31:16,088
Nothing more.

668
01:31:17,887 --> 01:31:21,348
Why are you telling me this now?

669
01:31:21,349 --> 01:31:26,349
What's happened?

670
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:32,104
What's changed?

671
01:31:33,361 --> 01:31:38,073
Did you speak to Tania for me?

672
01:31:38,074 --> 01:31:39,616
Yes.

673
01:31:39,617 --> 01:31:44,617
Well, will she reconsider?

674
01:31:45,998 --> 01:31:50,835
I don't know.

675
01:31:50,836 --> 01:31:54,172
She should. She'll be much safer.
She should. You know that.

676
01:31:54,173 --> 01:31:55,298
Yeah.

677
01:31:55,299 --> 01:31:58,259
It'll be easier to get her reassigned
than you.

678
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:01,054
You see, the Germans are preparing
another offensive in the city centre.

679
01:32:01,055 --> 01:32:03,306
The propaganda battle's crucial
for morale.

680
01:32:03,307 --> 01:32:08,307
We need you more than ever.
Sacha? Hold on. Sacha?

681
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:14,526
- Tell him what you know, Sacha.
- Hello, Sacha.

682
01:32:14,527 --> 01:32:16,486
There was dust on the major's boots.

683
01:32:16,487 --> 01:32:21,032
Sacha has the major convinced
he's gone over to the other side.

684
01:32:21,033 --> 01:32:24,035
I don't need to tell you
the risks he's taking.

685
01:32:24,036 --> 01:32:25,412
The dust was yellow.

686
01:32:25,413 --> 01:32:27,747
There's only one place
where there's dust like that.

687
01:32:27,748 --> 01:32:32,748
In the back of the chemical factory,
a big heap along the tracks.

688
01:32:33,879 --> 01:32:35,880
Well done.

689
01:32:35,881 --> 01:32:40,881
Sacha, wait for me outside then.

690
01:32:46,892 --> 01:32:51,892
Danilov, you had no right to use him.

691
01:32:53,566 --> 01:32:58,566
No, I didn't use him, Vassili.
He did it of his own accord.

692
01:32:59,196 --> 01:33:04,196
Do you know why?
Because he believes in you!

693
01:33:11,042 --> 01:33:14,794
Tomorrow morning, we're gonna
take back the chemical factory.

694
01:33:14,795 --> 01:33:18,590
Sacha has informed the major
you'll be there.

695
01:33:18,591 --> 01:33:20,800
So now you know
where you have to wait for him.

696
01:33:20,801 --> 01:33:24,220
- In the middle of an assault.
- I'm following orders.

697
01:33:24,221 --> 01:33:28,016
I suggest you do the same.

698
01:33:28,017 --> 01:33:33,017
Now, I'm aware of the risks.
You'll be fine.

699
01:33:38,235 --> 01:33:38,779
Comrade.

700
01:34:06,806 --> 01:34:10,183
That's the Germans up there.
Yesterday, it was the Russians.

701
01:34:10,184 --> 01:34:14,437
We're not very far now.

702
01:34:14,438 --> 01:34:17,315
Sacha,

703
01:34:17,316 --> 01:34:21,027
you're playing a very dangerous game.

704
01:34:21,028 --> 01:34:24,155
I want you to win.

705
01:34:24,156 --> 01:34:27,575
See there? Keep going along the river.

706
01:34:27,576 --> 01:34:32,576
It's safe for a while.

707
01:39:08,816 --> 01:39:11,109
He's dead.

708
01:39:11,110 --> 01:39:15,905
We found this on his corpse.

709
01:39:15,906 --> 01:39:19,784
Your reason for being here
has ceased to exist.

710
01:39:19,785 --> 01:39:23,121
Pardon me, Herr General.

711
01:39:23,122 --> 01:39:24,330
But I do not believe...

712
01:39:24,331 --> 01:39:29,331
There's a plane bound for Berlin
tomorrow evening. You will be on it.

713
01:39:32,339 --> 01:39:37,339
Until then I must ask you
for your dog tags.

714
01:39:37,428 --> 01:39:41,139
Imagine how Russian propaganda
would profit from your death.

715
01:39:41,140 --> 01:39:44,016
If you fall, you will fall unknown.

716
01:39:44,017 --> 01:39:49,017
You've already had a near miss.

717
01:39:55,237 --> 01:39:58,239
Also, please take this war merit cross.

718
01:39:58,240 --> 01:40:00,241
It was awarded posthumously
to a lieutenant

719
01:40:00,242 --> 01:40:01,993
of the 116th infantry division,

720
01:40:01,994 --> 01:40:06,994
who fell here
during the first days of the battle.

721
01:40:06,999 --> 01:40:11,377
He was my son.

722
01:40:11,378 --> 01:40:16,378
If the landing is captured,
everything's lost.

723
01:40:17,050 --> 01:40:22,050
Come here.

724
01:40:22,097 --> 01:40:23,973
What did I tell you?

725
01:40:23,974 --> 01:40:26,726
You've been playing your fiddle
too much.

726
01:40:26,727 --> 01:40:30,521
If it's confirmed that he's dead,
we're sunk.

727
01:40:30,522 --> 01:40:33,357
- Well, you're sunk.
- It isn't true.

728
01:40:33,358 --> 01:40:36,235
It was intercepted
from their staff headquarters.

729
01:40:36,236 --> 01:40:39,989
What do they have to do?
Dangle his body in front of our men?

730
01:40:39,990 --> 01:40:42,408
They're lying-

731
01:40:42,409 --> 01:40:44,160
That's good.

732
01:40:44,161 --> 01:40:46,704
Very good.

733
01:40:46,705 --> 01:40:50,333
Write it then.
Vassili Zaitsev is not dead!

734
01:40:50,334 --> 01:40:52,877
This is what he had for breakfast
this morning.

735
01:40:52,878 --> 01:40:56,130
This is a picture of him
reading today's newspaper.

736
01:40:56,131 --> 01:40:57,798
You're the poet.

737
01:40:57,799 --> 01:41:02,094
What? You won't give up the riverbank.

738
01:41:02,095 --> 01:41:05,264
I don't care if you've lost half your men.

739
01:41:05,265 --> 01:41:10,265
Lose the other half or lose yourself!

740
01:41:14,525 --> 01:41:19,320
Is he back?

741
01:41:19,321 --> 01:41:21,906
He should be back soon.

742
01:41:21,907 --> 01:41:26,907
The German attack cut the lines,
that's why he's late.

743
01:41:28,747 --> 01:41:33,747
Can we go outside?

744
01:41:36,797 --> 01:41:39,674
I wrote to my mother about you.

745
01:41:39,675 --> 01:41:41,759
She wanted me to tell you
that once this war was over,

746
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,970
if there's anything you needed,
anything at all,

747
01:41:43,971 --> 01:41:48,683
our family will be there for you.

748
01:41:48,684 --> 01:41:53,684
You know I'm here for you.

749
01:41:55,774 --> 01:41:57,984
They're saying Vassili is dead.

750
01:41:57,985 --> 01:42:02,321
Vassili Zaitsev will never see
his loved ones again.

751
01:42:02,322 --> 01:42:07,322
Surrender. This is your only hope.

752
01:42:09,997 --> 01:42:13,457
You're upset?

753
01:42:13,458 --> 01:42:17,628
Because Zaitsev is dead?

754
01:42:17,629 --> 01:42:21,632
You don't have to hide it.
There's no shame in it.

755
01:42:21,633 --> 01:42:26,633
You're Russian like he is.

756
01:42:26,763 --> 01:42:29,348
Don't listen to them.

757
01:42:29,349 --> 01:42:32,435
It's just propaganda.

758
01:42:32,436 --> 01:42:35,521
He isn't dead.

759
01:42:35,522 --> 01:42:38,774
And do you know why?

760
01:42:38,775 --> 01:42:43,775
Because I haven't killed him yet.

761
01:42:48,535 --> 01:42:51,203
I'm going to tell you a little secret.

762
01:42:51,204 --> 01:42:54,999
Only you,
because I know I can trust you.

763
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:00,000
But you must swear to me
that you won't tell another soul.

764
01:43:00,797 --> 01:43:03,883
You swear?

765
01:43:03,884 --> 01:43:06,677
I found a terrific spot.

766
01:43:06,678 --> 01:43:09,847
It's by the exit from the train station.

767
01:43:09,848 --> 01:43:12,642
I'll hide in the water tower.

768
01:43:12,643 --> 01:43:16,187
Tomorrow I'll wait for him there.

769
01:43:16,188 --> 01:43:20,858
You'll see. He'll be there.

770
01:43:20,859 --> 01:43:25,859
He always is.

771
01:43:32,663 --> 01:43:34,163
I also want you to swear to me

772
01:43:34,164 --> 01:43:37,958
that from now on you'll stay home
where you belong.

773
01:43:37,959 --> 01:43:40,795
Do you swear?

774
01:43:40,796 --> 01:43:41,296
Yes?

775
01:43:45,676 --> 01:43:47,760
Good.

776
01:43:47,761 --> 01:43:49,929
We know he's alive,
we know he won't fail us,

777
01:43:49,930 --> 01:43:51,847
we know because
he is a part of us now.

778
01:43:51,848 --> 01:43:56,352
Vassili is eternal.

779
01:43:56,353 --> 01:44:00,189
Where have you been?
We've looked everywhere for you.

780
01:44:00,190 --> 01:44:03,734
Didn't you hear? I was dead.

781
01:44:03,735 --> 01:44:08,735
At least, noble sniper Zaitsev

782
01:44:09,741 --> 01:44:12,660
Vassili was dead.

783
01:44:12,661 --> 01:44:16,956
The real one.

784
01:44:16,957 --> 01:44:20,042
Me.

785
01:44:20,043 --> 01:44:24,171
I was asleep. And I missed my chance.

786
01:44:24,172 --> 01:44:29,172
Then I was curled up in a corner hiding

787
01:44:29,261 --> 01:44:32,096
from a man who wants to kill me.

788
01:44:32,097 --> 01:44:34,432
I'll talk to Khrushchev.

789
01:44:34,433 --> 01:44:37,685
He'll send you back to your old division.

790
01:44:37,686 --> 01:44:41,272
- Where's Tania?
- She's at the shelter.

791
01:44:41,273 --> 01:44:46,273
- I've been to the shelter.
- I told her you weren't dead.

792
01:44:47,571 --> 01:44:51,615
The major said so.
He said the other Germans were lying.

793
01:44:51,616 --> 01:44:56,616
He told me you were waiting for him
at the station.

794
01:44:58,039 --> 01:44:58,583
Vassili.

795
01:45:20,270 --> 01:45:24,106
Vassili.

796
01:45:24,107 --> 01:45:24,651
Vassili.

797
01:45:32,783 --> 01:45:35,910
My little Sacha.

798
01:45:35,911 --> 01:45:40,911
I knew it.

799
01:45:55,889 --> 01:46:00,889
- Vassili.
- Tania.

800
01:46:04,564 --> 01:46:08,025
I knew you weren't dead.

801
01:46:08,026 --> 01:46:13,026
- How?
- Because we've only just met.

802
01:46:15,826 --> 01:46:20,826
I prayed for the first time
since I was a little girl.

803
01:46:21,248 --> 01:46:24,458
When I opened my eyes,
Sacha was standing there

804
01:46:24,459 --> 01:46:29,459
waiting to give me the good news.

805
01:46:29,756 --> 01:46:34,756
I think he loves you even more than I do.

806
01:46:56,992 --> 01:46:59,451
To the proper military authority.

807
01:46:59,452 --> 01:47:01,078
I'm calling to
the commandant's attention,

808
01:47:01,079 --> 01:47:03,122
the recent changes noticed
in the attitude

809
01:47:03,123 --> 01:47:07,001
towards fighting
of soldier, Vassili Zaitsev.

810
01:47:07,002 --> 01:47:10,629
He has attempted, on several
occasions, to escape his duties,

811
01:47:10,630 --> 01:47:13,090
voiced doubts
on the chances of our victory,

812
01:47:13,091 --> 01:47:16,385
and made defeatist comments in public.

813
01:47:16,386 --> 01:47:21,386
The inexplicable duration of his duel
with a Nazi sharpshooter

814
01:47:21,641 --> 01:47:26,641
can only be explained by his lack
of belief in the Communist ideal.

815
01:47:35,113 --> 01:47:39,325
Good morning, Sacha.

816
01:47:39,326 --> 01:47:43,037
Once again,
he knew exactly where to find me.

817
01:47:43,038 --> 01:47:46,373
Don't you think that's strange?

818
01:47:46,374 --> 01:47:50,794
Apart from me, only you knew.

819
01:47:50,795 --> 01:47:55,795
I don't hold it against you, Sacha.
You've done a very brave thing.

820
01:47:56,676 --> 01:47:59,720
You've chosen your camp.
I respect that.

821
01:47:59,721 --> 01:48:02,056
But it isn't my camp.

822
01:48:02,057 --> 01:48:04,642
We're both soldiers.

823
01:48:04,643 --> 01:48:09,563
We're both enemies,
so I know you understand.

824
01:48:09,564 --> 01:48:11,023
I'm annoyed with you, little Sacha,

825
01:48:11,024 --> 01:48:15,235
for not staying at home
as I made you swear to do.

826
01:48:15,236 --> 01:48:20,236
I'm annoyed with you for obliging me
to do what I'm going to have to do.

827
01:48:23,912 --> 01:48:28,912
I've never seen anyone frown
so much in their sleep.

828
01:48:31,169 --> 01:48:36,169
- How long have you been watching me?
- All night.

829
01:48:36,299 --> 01:48:39,176
You've been snoring away happily
for hours.

830
01:48:39,177 --> 01:48:42,221
I don't snore, do I?

831
01:48:42,222 --> 01:48:43,806
Like a pig!

832
01:48:43,807 --> 01:48:48,807
- I suppose I talk in my sleep as well?
- Yes.

833
01:48:50,814 --> 01:48:55,814
There's something I should tell you.

834
01:49:00,573 --> 01:49:05,573
On the train coming here,

835
01:49:07,539 --> 01:49:09,331
we were in the same car.

836
01:49:09,332 --> 01:49:11,208
No.

837
01:49:11,209 --> 01:49:13,752
I saw you.

838
01:49:13,753 --> 01:49:18,753
You were reading and you fell asleep.

839
01:49:19,718 --> 01:49:24,718
I didn't dare look at you,
you were so beautiful.

840
01:49:25,056 --> 01:49:29,768
You were scary.

841
01:49:29,769 --> 01:49:34,023
Afterwards, I couldn't stop thinking
about you.

842
01:49:34,024 --> 01:49:37,234
It made me smile.

843
01:49:37,235 --> 01:49:42,235
And then I thought of all the men
who would get to hold you,

844
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:48,704
who'd make you laugh,

845
01:49:48,705 --> 01:49:53,705
how lucky they were.

846
01:49:54,210 --> 01:49:59,210
And now I'm the one lying next to you.

847
01:49:59,799 --> 01:50:04,799
- Was I snoring?
- Like a pig.

848
01:50:35,502 --> 01:50:36,002
What?

849
01:50:40,465 --> 01:50:44,259
Oh, my God!

850
01:50:44,260 --> 01:50:45,719
Tania, no.

851
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:47,805
- No, get off me!
- Tania, no.

852
01:50:47,806 --> 01:50:49,807
- Get off me!
- It's what he wants.

853
01:50:49,808 --> 01:50:51,767
- Get off me!
- This is what he wants.

854
01:50:51,768 --> 01:50:54,311
- Get off me!
- No. He'll kill you.

855
01:50:54,312 --> 01:50:55,729
- Let me go!
- He'll kill you,

856
01:50:55,730 --> 01:50:57,314
- and then I'll run after you...
- Let me go!

857
01:50:57,315 --> 01:50:59,358
- ...and he'll kill me, too.
- Let me go!

858
01:50:59,359 --> 01:51:04,359
This is what he wants. I'll get him.
I promise I'll get him.

859
01:51:05,073 --> 01:51:10,073
I'll get his rifle for
you, I promise, Tania.

860
01:51:28,805 --> 01:51:33,805
I need you.

861
01:51:33,893 --> 01:51:37,229
You have to leave now, Mrs. Filipov.
Stalingrad may fall.

862
01:51:37,230 --> 01:51:39,857
The last of the boats are leaving.
The Germans will be here any moment.

863
01:51:39,858 --> 01:51:43,110
He's brought you a pass.
You'll be safe on the other side.

864
01:51:43,111 --> 01:51:44,278
You have to gather your things,

865
01:51:44,279 --> 01:51:46,071
and we'll help you carry them
to the landing stage.

866
01:51:46,072 --> 01:51:51,072
I'm not leaving. This is my home.
This is my Sacha's home. I can't leave.

867
01:51:52,787 --> 01:51:57,787
I have to tell you something,
Mrs. Filipov.

868
01:51:57,834 --> 01:52:01,587
Something very difficult to understand.

869
01:52:01,588 --> 01:52:06,588
It's about Sacha.

870
01:52:17,353 --> 01:52:20,189
He's gone over to the Germans.
He's betrayed his country.

871
01:52:20,190 --> 01:52:25,190
He's with the enemy now.
He won't be coming back.

872
01:52:25,195 --> 01:52:30,195
Oh, my God.

873
01:52:30,950 --> 01:52:34,953
Oh, my God.

874
01:52:34,954 --> 01:52:38,665
He's become a traitor.

875
01:52:38,666 --> 01:52:41,752
The poor little thing.

876
01:52:41,753 --> 01:52:46,753
What has he done?

877
01:52:47,217 --> 01:52:52,217
So he's going to stay over there?

878
01:52:54,432 --> 01:52:59,432
Yes. He's going to stay over there.

879
01:53:00,438 --> 01:53:02,856
I shouldn't be saying this,
Comrade Commissar,

880
01:53:02,857 --> 01:53:06,026
but maybe it's for the best.

881
01:53:06,027 --> 01:53:08,487
If the Germans have won, he'll be safe.

882
01:53:08,488 --> 01:53:13,488
I know it's wrong,
but perhaps he's made the right choice.

883
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:35,722
- Tania!
- Tania!

884
01:53:35,723 --> 01:53:40,723
- Tania!
- Tania!

885
01:53:58,830 --> 01:54:03,830
I need a doctor. A doctor!

886
01:54:07,463 --> 01:54:12,463
I have a pass. I have a pass.
You must let her cross.

887
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:17,306
Please.

888
01:54:17,307 --> 01:54:19,057
- It's useless. She'll never make it.
- No.

889
01:54:19,058 --> 01:54:24,058
No, she will. She's my daughter.
She's my daughter, I beg of you.

890
01:54:25,189 --> 01:54:30,189
All right. All right, you two,
put this one on the boat.

891
01:55:17,867 --> 01:55:21,661
Where is he? Where's the major?

892
01:55:21,662 --> 01:55:26,541
A few inches from your face.

893
01:55:26,542 --> 01:55:30,962
I've been such a fool, Vassili.

894
01:55:30,963 --> 01:55:33,965
Man will always be man.

895
01:55:33,966 --> 01:55:37,469
There is no new man.

896
01:55:37,470 --> 01:55:40,806
We tried so hard to create
a society that was equal,

897
01:55:40,807 --> 01:55:44,810
where there'd be nothing
to envy your neighbor.

898
01:55:44,811 --> 01:55:48,897
But there's always something to envy.

899
01:55:48,898 --> 01:55:53,898
A smile, a friendship.

900
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:58,490
Something you don't have
and want to appropriate.

901
01:55:58,491 --> 01:56:02,994
In this world, even a Soviet one,

902
01:56:02,995 --> 01:56:07,165
there will always be rich and poor.

903
01:56:07,166 --> 01:56:10,585
Rich in gifts,

904
01:56:10,586 --> 01:56:13,588
poor in gifts.

905
01:56:13,589 --> 01:56:17,175
Rich in love,

906
01:56:17,176 --> 01:56:22,176
poor in love.

907
01:56:25,017 --> 01:56:29,187
Tania isn't coming back.

908
01:56:29,188 --> 01:56:34,188
She's dead, Vassili.

909
01:56:39,949 --> 01:56:42,284
She was cut down by shrapnel.

910
01:56:42,285 --> 01:56:47,285
It was quick.
I don't think she even saw it coming.

911
01:56:47,915 --> 01:56:49,875
She was on her way back to you,

912
01:56:49,876 --> 01:56:53,545
as soon as she had seen Mrs. Filipov
to the boats.

913
01:56:53,546 --> 01:56:57,883
She was coming back for you.
She was right.

914
01:56:57,884 --> 01:57:02,884
You're a good man, Vassili.

915
01:57:04,265 --> 01:57:09,265
I want to help you, Vassili.
Let me do one last thing.

916
01:57:09,437 --> 01:57:14,437
Something useful for a change.

917
01:57:17,987 --> 01:57:22,987
- Let me show you where the major is.
- No, don't do that. Don't do that!

918
02:01:36,829 --> 02:01:41,829
Today, February the 3rd, 1943,
is an ominous day for Hitler

919
02:01:41,917 --> 02:01:46,421
and the endless columns of hundreds
of thousands of German prisoners.

920
02:01:46,422 --> 02:01:50,341
It is an unforgettable day of hope
for our motherland,

921
02:01:50,342 --> 02:01:55,342
for the people of
the Soviet Union, and...

922
02:02:02,521 --> 02:02:07,521
Today after 180 days of growing combat
in the martyred city of Stalingrad,

923
02:02:09,445 --> 02:02:14,445
and as a result of the valor
and self-sacrifice of our soldiers,

924
02:02:14,742 --> 02:02:18,036
the commander
of our glorious Red Army

925
02:02:18,037 --> 02:02:23,037
received the unconditional surrender
of the German fascist invasion.

926
02:02:39,892 --> 02:02:42,060
I cannot find the matching name
in the book.

927
02:02:42,061 --> 02:02:44,896
Could you check again, please?
This is the address of this hospital

928
02:02:44,897 --> 02:02:46,272
- and this is her name.
- She's not here, Comrade.

929
02:02:46,273 --> 02:02:47,607
Yes. This is our address,

930
02:02:47,608 --> 02:02:50,902
- but she's not here.
- We don't have her anymore.

931
02:02:50,903 --> 02:02:52,195
This is the address of this place...

932
02:02:52,196 --> 02:02:53,738
- I'm so sorry.
- ...so she's obviously been here.

933
02:02:53,739 --> 02:02:55,365
- She wrote to me.
- ...three times in the books,

934
02:02:55,366 --> 02:02:56,741
but she's not here.

935
02:02:56,742 --> 02:03:01,742
Believe me. There is no
Tania Chernova. I can't help you.
