<i>- Opening night
- Opening night</i>

3
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,040
<i>It's opening night</i>

4
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,050
<i>It's Max Bialystock's latest show</i>

5
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,050
<i>Will it flop or will it go?</i>

6
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,220
<i>The cast is taking its final bow</i>

7
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,230
<i>Here comes the audience now</i>

8
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,060
<i>The doors are open
They're on their way</i>

9
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:08,690
<i>Let's hear what they have to say</i>

10
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:13,740
<i>He's done it again
He's done it again</i>

11
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,740
<i>Max Bialystock has done it again</i>

12
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,830
<i>We can't believe it</i>

13
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,910
<i>You can't conceive it</i>

14
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,670
<i>How'd he achieve it?</i>

15
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,300
<i>It's the worst show in town</i>

16
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,260
<i>We sat there sighing</i>

17
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,340
<i>Groaning and crying</i>

18
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,970
<i>There's no denying</i>

19
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,270
<i>It's the worst show in town</i>

20
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,480
<i>Oh, we wanted to stand up and hiss</i>

21
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:49,480
<i>We've seen shit
But never like this</i>

22
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,900
<i>Max Bialystock has done it again</i>

23
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,120
<i>The songs were rotten
The book was stinkin'</i>

24
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,700
<i>What he did to Shak espeare
Booth did to Lincoln</i>

25
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,830
We had this specially made up
for Max Bialystock.

26
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:12,670
<i>We couldn't leave faster</i>

27
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,090
<i>What a disaster</i>

28
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,060
<i>We are still in shock</i>

29
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,770
<i>Who produced this schlock?</i>

30
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,980
<i>That slimy, sleazy Max Bialystock</i>

31
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,230
<i>What a bum</i>

32
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,200
Hello?

33
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,830
Mr. Bialystock?

34
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,090
Anybody here?

35
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,180
Mr. Bialystock?

36
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,600
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

37
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,940
What do you want?

38
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,520
Speak to me, dummy. Speak!

39
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,230
Why don't you speak?

40
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,610
Scared. Can't talk.

41
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,110
All right, I'm sorry.

42
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,160
I'm sorry. Calm down. Get ahold
of yourself. Come with me.

43
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,040
Come on. Come on.

44
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,370
Come on, right this way.
Watch your step.

45
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,580
Look, just...

46
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,040
Take a deep breath.

47
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,380
Let it out slowly.

48
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,340
- Who are you?
- I am Leopold Bloom.

49
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,010
I'm an accountant.
I'm from Whitehall & Marks...

50
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,480
...and I've come to do your books.
- Oh, you have, huh? Well, listen...

51
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,690
- Who is it?
- Hold Me- Touch Me.

52
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,900
Hold Me- Touch Me.
One of my backers.

53
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,110
Listen, I have to meet
with an important investor.

54
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,570
Do me a big favour,
go to the bathroom.

55
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:05,580
- But I don't have to go.
- Try. Try. Think of Niagara Falls.

56
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,290
Be with you in a moment,
my darling.

57
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,010
Hold Me- Touch Me.
Where is Hold Me- Touch Me?

58
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,840
Kiss Me- Feel Me,
Clinch Me- Pinch Me...

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,300
...Lick Me- Bite Me, Suck Me...

60
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,390
Here she is. Hold Me- Touch Me.

61
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,600
You know, it worked.
As soon as I pictured Niagara Falls...

62
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,520
...I didn't have any trouble at all...
- Back. Back. Don't make a sound.

63
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,780
Coming. Coming.

64
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,050
Hello, gorgeous.

65
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,590
- Hold me, touch me.
- As soon as I shut the door.

66
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,930
Did you bring the checkie?

67
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,060
Bialy can't produce plays
without checkies.

68
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,650
Here you go.

69
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,990
But first,
can we please play a game?

70
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,070
One dirty little game.

71
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:29,490
All right, my little sex kitten.

72
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,370
What shall we play?

73
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,540
The Debutante and the Bricklayer?

74
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,500
- Oh, no.
- No.

75
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,130
How about the Rabbi
and the Contortionist?

76
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,340
You like that one, mama,
keeps you limber.

77
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,800
I know.

78
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,350
Let's play the Virgin Milkmaid
and the Well-Hung Stableboy.

79
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,730
I don't think I have the strength.

80
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,150
- Don't worry, I'll be gentle.
- All right.

81
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,440
Oh, dear...

82
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:10,030
...this milk is so heavy.
I'll never reach the house.

83
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,870
You there, well-hung stableboy.

84
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,630
Won't you please help me?

85
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,840
Of course, my little dairy queen.

86
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,640
First I'll take your milk.

87
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:31,140
Then I shall take your virginity!

88
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,230
No! No! Never! Never!

89
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,270
Yes. Yes.

90
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,070
Give it to me, well-hung!
Give it to me.

91
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,900
Darling, wait,
I haven't even had coffee yet.

92
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,820
- Take it easy. Take it easy.
- Oh, my God.

93
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:51,030
Send me to the moon, you animal.
Send me to the moon.

94
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:55,580
Yes. Yes, my darling.
Thursday. Come back Thursday.

95
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,080
I'll send you to the moon Thursday.
I may even join you.

96
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,420
But first, the checkie.

97
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,510
Where's the checkie?
Come on, come on, find the checkie.

98
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,010
Here you go.

99
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:16,850
I made it out, like you told me,
to the title of the play:

100
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,560
<i>- Cash.
- Yes.</i>

101
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,560
<i>That's a funny name
for a play, Cash.</i>

102
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,530
<i>Yes, so was The Iceman Cometh.</i>

103
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,440
I'll see you Thursday.

104
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,700
- Bye.
- Bye. Bye.

105
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,870
Yes, yes, yes.

106
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,880
You dirty old buzzard.

107
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,210
May I come out of the bathroom now,
Mr. Bialystock?

108
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,130
- Yeah, sure.
- I'm terribly sorry I caught you...

109
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,140
...feeling up the old lady.
- " Feeling up the old lady."

110
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,350
Thank you, Mr. Tact.

111
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,640
- May I take your coat?
- Oh, thank you.

112
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,730
So you're an accountant, huh?

113
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,310
- Yes, sir. I am, sir.
- Then account for yourself!

114
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,570
<i>Why are you looking up little
old ladies' dresses? Bit of a pervert?</i>

115
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,440
I know what you're thinking.

116
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,320
How dare you condemn me
without knowing all the facts.

117
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,910
- Mr. Bialystock, I wasn't condemn...
- Shut up!

118
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,620
I'm having a rhetorical conversation.

119
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,960
- Do you know who I used to be?
- Well, yes. You're Max Bialystock...

120
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:24,540
...the king of Broadway.
- No, I'm Max Bialy... That's right.

121
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,760
- That's right.
- And might I say, Mr. Bialystock...

122
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,420
And please don't take this
the wrong way...

123
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,300
...but you're not just a dirty old man.
- Thank you.

124
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,640
Oh, you're also
a great Broadway producer.

125
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,680
And there's something about me
you should know.

126
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,390
When I was a kid...

127
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:45,560
<i>...I had the good fortune
to be taken to Bialy-Hoos of '42.</i>

128
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,780
<i>- Oh, Bialy-Hoos.
- Yes.</i>

129
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,860
And I still have the ticket stub.

130
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,990
- Oh, look at that.
- Yeah.

131
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,280
And ever since,
I've had a secret desire...

132
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,370
...to be a Broadway producer.

133
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,000
A secret desire, huh?

134
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,540
- Kid, can I give you some advice?
- Yes, sir.

135
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,170
Keep it a secret.
Do the books, please.

136
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,460
Top drawer, to the left.

137
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,640
Oh, my God.

138
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,680
Will you look at that.

139
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:26,940
That's it, baby!
When you got it, flaunt it! Flaunt it!

140
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,320
Mr. Bialystock,
may I speak to you a minute?

141
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,450
- A minute?
- Yes.

142
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,910
- Just one minute?
- Yes.

143
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,160
- Okay.
- In glancing at your books...

144
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,700
- Go! You have 58 seconds left.
...I noticed that in the column...

145
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,210
- You're gonna time it?
- Time is money.

146
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,580
I looked at your books and the
columns marked "monies received."

147
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,750
- And I can't make the figures work out.
- Forty-eight seconds. Hurry.

148
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,550
- There's a problem with your figures.
- Twenty-eight. Running out of time.

149
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,090
- Tick, tock. Tick, tock. Tick, tock.
- I cannot...

150
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,350
- Fifteen seconds.
- I cannot... I can't function.

151
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,810
- I cannot function in these conditions.
- Five, four, three, two, one.

152
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,310
You're making me
extremely nervous.

153
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,940
What is that, a handkerchief?

154
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,980
What? This? No, it's nothing.
It's nothing.

155
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:15,450
Well, if it's nothing,
then why can't I see it?

156
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,120
My blanket. My blue blanket!

157
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,830
Give me back my blue blanket!

158
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:28,880
Give me my blanket! Give it to me.
Give it to me. Give me the blanket.

159
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,800
Give it to me! Give it to me!

160
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,090
Here, here, here.

161
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,590
Don't panic. Don't panic.
Don't panic.

162
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,760
I...

163
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,180
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,230
It's just that I don't like anyone
touching my blue blanket.

165
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,650
It's not important,
it's a minor compulsion.

166
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,690
I can deal with it if I want to.

167
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:55,570
But I've had it ever since I was a baby,
and I find it very comforting.

168
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,160
I need to lie down for a minute now.

169
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:07,000
They come here. They all come here.

170
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,670
How do they find me?

171
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,630
Hey, kid. Hey.

172
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,720
Look at this.

173
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,340
How can I help you?

174
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,970
- What's wrong?
- You're gonna jump on me.

175
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,970
- What?
- You're gonna jump on me.

176
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,020
I know you're gonna jump on me
and squash me like a bug.

177
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,150
- Oh, God.
- Please, don't jump on me!

178
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,980
I'm not gonna jump on you!
I'm not gonna jump on you!

179
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,820
Get ahold of yourself!
Stop it! Stop it!

180
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,030
Stop! Calm down!

181
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,410
Don't touch me! Don't touch me.

182
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,740
- What's the matter now?
- I'm hysterical. I'm having hysterics.

183
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,250
I can't stop when I get like this.
I can't stop. I'm hysterical.

184
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,040
I can see that.
All right. All right, calm down.

185
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,630
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Take it easy.

186
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,140
I'm wet!

187
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,060
I'm wet.
I'm hysterical and I'm wet!

188
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,560
I'm in pain.

189
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,690
I'm in pain, I'm wet...

190
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,490
...and I'm still hysterical.

191
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,160
All right, all right. What can I do?
You're getting me hysterical.

192
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,580
Move away, you frighten me.

193
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,080
- You're too close.
- I frighten you?

194
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,910
Yes, get over there and stop
touching... Move over there! Sit down.

195
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,370
I'm sitting, I'm sitting.

196
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,170
You still look angry.

197
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,250
I'm sorry. How's this?

198
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,470
Who's my little accountant?

199
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,720
Who's my little accountant?

200
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,770
Are you my little accountant?
Are you my little accountant?

201
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,770
- Are you my little accountant?
- I am.

202
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,980
Yes, you are.

203
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,780
Well, thank you for smiling.
That helped a great deal.

204
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,530
Well, you know what they say:

205
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,870
"Smile and the world smiles
with you."

206
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:10,290
This man should be
in a straightjacket.

207
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,290
- You feeling better?
- Oh, yes, I'm fine now. Thank you.

208
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,960
- Good.
- May I speak to you?

209
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,380
Yes, Prince Myshkin.
What can we do for you?

210
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,970
Well, this is hardly
the time for levity, Mr. Bialystock.

211
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,090
I've discovered a serious error...

212
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,010
<i>...in the accounts of your last show,
Funny Boy.</i>

213
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,970
- Where? What?
- Well, according to the backers list...

214
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:35,400
...you raised $100,000.
But your show only cost 98,000.

215
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,360
There's 2000 unaccounted for.

216
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,030
I went to a Turkish bath.
Who cares?

217
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,490
The show was a flop.
Bloom, do me a favour...

218
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,200
...move a few decimal points around.
You can do it, you're an accountant.

219
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,330
You're part of a noble profession.
The word "count" is part of your title.

220
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,330
- That's cheating.
- It's not cheating.

221
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,210
It's charity.

222
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,460
Bloom...

223
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,170
...you see this stickpin?

224
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,800
This once held a pearl
as big as your eye.

225
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:07,260
I used to wear handmade
Italian shoes, $500 suits.

226
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,510
And look at me now.

227
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:13,060
Look at me now!
I'm wearing a cardboard belt.

228
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,480
Bloom, you gotta save me.

229
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,940
I'm reaching out to you.

230
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,860
Don't send me to prison.

231
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,740
Help me.

232
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,080
All right. All right.
Okay, I'll do it.

233
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,710
- Really?
- Yes, I'll do it.

234
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,630
See, $2000 isn't so much.

235
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,760
I'm sure I can hide it someplace.

236
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,470
After all, the IRS isn't interested
in a show that flopped.

237
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,720
Right. Good thinking.

238
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,560
You figure it out.
I'm gonna take a little nap.

239
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,520
Now, let's see.

240
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,980
Let's see, if we add up
these deductions, we get...

241
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,730
Carry the three, divide by four...

242
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,240
Amazing.

243
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,910
It's absolutely amazing, but...

244
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,660
...under the right circumstances...

245
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,410
...a producer could
make more money with a flop...

246
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,660
...than he could with a hit.

247
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,330
Yes, it's quite possible. If he were
certain that a show would fail...

248
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,920
...a man could make a fortune.

249
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,000
- Yes?
- Yes, what?

250
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,010
- What you were saying. Keep talking.
- What was I saying?

251
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,720
You were saying that a producer...

252
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,260
...could make more money
with a flop than a hit.

253
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,100
Well, yes. It's quite possible.

254
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,470
You keep saying that,
but you don't say how.

255
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:38,560
Well, it's simply a matter
of creative accounting.

256
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,270
Let's assume for a moment
that you are a dishonest man.

257
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,690
Assume away.

258
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,240
<i>All right. When you produced
your last show, Funny Boy...</i>

259
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:50,200
...you raised $2000
more than you needed.

260
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,200
But you could've raised a million...

261
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,120
...put on your $100,000 flop
and kept the rest.

262
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,290
- But what if my show was a hit?
- Then you would go to jail.

263
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,620
See, rather than 100 percent
of the show...

264
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,000
...you would've sold
more than 1000 percent.

265
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,760
So if the show's a success,
there's no way to pay off the backers.

266
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,470
- Get it?
- Got it.

267
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,890
So in order for our scheme to work,
we'd have to find a sure- fire flop.

268
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,890
<i>"Our scheme"? What scheme?</i>

269
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,020
What scheme?

270
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,100
Your scheme,
you bloody little genius.

271
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,810
I meant no scheme. I merely posed
a little academic accounting theory.

272
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,150
- It was just a thought.
- Bloom...

273
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,490
...worlds are turned
on such thoughts.

274
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,240
Don't you see, Bloom?
Darling Bloom, glorious Bloom.

275
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,660
It's so simple.

276
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,200
Step one,
we find the worst play ever written.

277
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,540
Step two,
we hire the worst director in town.

278
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,540
- Step three, I raise 2 million dollars.
- Two?

279
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,170
Yes, one for me, one for you. There's
a lot of little old ladies out there.

280
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,670
Step four, we hire the worst actors
in New York and open on Broadway.

281
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,510
And before you can say "step five,"
we close on Broadway...

282
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,600
...take our 2 million and go to Rio.

283
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,350
Rio? That'd never work.

284
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,980
Oh, ye of little faith.

285
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,400
<i>What did Lewis say to Clark
When everything look ed bleak?</i>

286
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,320
<i>What did Sir Edmund say to Tenzing</i>

287
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,360
<i>As they struggled
Toward Everest's peak?</i>

288
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,360
<i>What did Washington say
To his troops</i>

289
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,570
<i>As they crossed the Delaware?</i>

290
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,490
<i>I'm sure you're well aware</i>

291
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,450
What'd they say?

292
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:23,460
<i>We can do it</i>

293
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,500
<i>We can do it</i>

294
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,800
<i>We can do it
Me and you</i>

295
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,630
<i>We can do it</i>

296
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,720
<i>We can do it</i>

297
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,140
<i>We can make our dreams come true</i>

298
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,220
<i>Everything you've ever wanted</i>

299
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,730
<i>Is just waiting to be had</i>

300
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,310
<i>Beautiful girls
Wearing nothing but pearls</i>

301
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,320
<i>Caressing you, undressing you
And driving you mad</i>

302
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,190
No.

303
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,450
Bloom. Bloom, wait a minute, now.

304
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:59,240
Hear me out. Just think about it.

305
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,510
Stop!

306
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,430
<i>We can do it
We can do it</i>

307
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,800
<i>This is not the time to shirk</i>

308
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,930
<i>We can do it

What do you say, Bloom?

315
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,950
<i>What do I say?</i>

316
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:47,750
<i>Finally, a chance to be
A Broadway producer</i>

320
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:59,800
<i>Here's what I say to you, sir</i>

321

<i>I can't do it
I can't do it</i>

<i>I can't do it
That's not me</i>

323

Why, you miserable, cowardly,
wretched little caterpillar.

330

Don't you ever wanna become
a butterfly?

331
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:40,640
Don't you want to spread your wings

332
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,140
No!

333
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,350
- Where to?
- Central Park.

334
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,270
Gotta breathe. Gotta breathe.

Fail? How could it miss?
All you need is a little courage.

351
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:55,170
Bloom, you know what you are?
You're like a...

352
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,170
You're like a...

353
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:01,550
You're like a fountain waiting

00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,260
- I'm a fountain?
- Yes, you're a fountain!

355
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:09,230
Don't you realize? There's a lot more
to you than there is to you.

356
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,400
Mr. Bialystock, I'm afraid you've made
a terrible error in judgment.

357
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,940
You've mistaken me
for someone with a spine.

358
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,820
I'm going back
to Whitehall & Marks now.

359

- Goodbye forever.
- Bloom. Bloom, wait a minute! Bloom.

Think about it. You'll never get a cab

Where the hell have you been?

You are six minutes late.
This is an accounting firm...

You can't come and go as you please.

- Yes, Mr. Marks.
- Remember, you're a nobody.

A PA. A public accountant.

And I am a CPA.
A certified public accountant.

374
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:52,240
A rank a miserable little worm like
yourself could never hope to achieve.

Yes, Mr. Marks.
Thank you for speaking to me.

You're welcome.

What are you gawking at?

378
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,170
You never saw a person
humiliated before?

379
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:05,300
Now, get back to work. All of you!

Bloom,

You've already had
your toilet break.

I'm not going into the toilet.
I'm going into show business.

And, Mr. Marks,
I have news for you. I quit!

- Oh, just this...

452
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:29,290
Just this: When I said that I was
scared that I was gonna go to jail...

...I didn't realize
that I already was in jail.

I've spent my life counting
other people's money.

And, Leo, you're gonna have it.
Because...

461
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:04,360
<i>- We can do it, we can do it
- I'm gonna be a producer</i>

462
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,570
<i>Say goodbye to woe and gloom</i>

463
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:11,040
<i>- With your brilliance, my resilience
- I'm gonna be a producer</i>

464
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:14,210
<i>- Up together we will zoom
- Up together we will zoom</i>

465
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,460
<i>- We can do it, we can do it
- We can do it, we can do it</i>

466
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,800
<i>Every show I touch I doom</i>

467
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,550
<i>- We were fated
- We were fated</i>

468
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,300
<i>- To be mated
- To be mated</i>

469
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:30,890
<i>- We're Bialystock and Bloom
- We're Bialystock and Bloom</i>

470
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,950
Oh, Max...

471
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:51,240
Oh, Max, let's give up.
I can't read anymore.

472
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,950
- How many plays can a person read?
- Stop complaining.

473
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,250
We have to find the worst play
ever written.

474
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,380
- I've been reading all night.
- Who cares?

475
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:02,800
You wanna be a producer, read,
read. Keep reading.

476
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,550
Here's one.

477
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,590
Act I, scene one.

478
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,350
"Gregor Samsa awoke one morning
to discover...

479
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,930
...that he had been transformed
into a giant cockroach."

480
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,400
No, too good.

481
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:26,400
" But how could you see me?
The glass was frosted."

482
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,450
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I've read this before.

483
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:34,830
I think I've read this one before.
What's it called? What's it called?

484
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,620
<i>The Frosted Glass.</i>

485
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,460
Max, I'm reading plays
that I read last night, Max.

486
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,630
I can't go on anymore.
It's too much.

487
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:45,460
Let's face it, we'll never find it.

488
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:56,770
We'll never find it.
We'll never find it.

489
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,980
We'll never find it.
We'll never find it.

490
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,480
Leo. Leo. See it? Smell it.

491
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,400
Touch it. Kiss it. Kiss it.

492
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,900
It's the mother lode.

493
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,150
- What is it? You found a flop?
- A flop.

494
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,110
That's putting it mildly.

495
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,030
This is a catastrophe.

496
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:18,700
A disaster certain to offend peoples
of all races, creeds and religions.

497
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,120
A guaranteed- to-close- in-one- night
beauty.

498
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,090
- Well, let's see it.
- Here.

499
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,130
<i>"Springtime for Hitler...</i>

500
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:34,180
...a gay romp with Eva and Adolf
at Berchtesgaden."

501
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,850
Oh, my God.

502
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,680
"Oh, my God" is right.

503
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,900
It's practically a love letter to Hitler.

504
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:47,690
- Max, this won't run a week.
- A week? Are you kidding?

505
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:51,360
This play has got to close
on page four.

506
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,950
What's the author's name again?

507
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:57,540
" Franz Liebkind. 61 Jane Street,
New York, New York."

508
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:00,830
Franz Liebkind. 61 Jane Street.

509
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:05,540
<i>Let's go. We'll get the Broadway
rights to Springtime for Hitler...</i>

510
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,840
...even if we have to go so far
as to pay him.

511
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:11,550
- Come on.
- This other hat, Max...

512
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,220
...may I wear it?

513
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,470
- No, you may not.
- Why?

514
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:19,930
Because that
is a Broadway producer's hat.

515
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,560
You don't get to wear
a Broadway producer's hat, son...

516
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,060
...until you're a Broadway producer.

517
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,060
And you're not
a Broadway producer until...

518
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,650
I know, I know. Until I've produced
a show on Broadway.

519
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:34,570
But I'm going to wear that hat,
and soon too, because...

520
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:37,780
<i>We're gonna be the producers</i>

521
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:42,080
<i>Of a great big Broadway flop</i>

522
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:55,010
<i>Ja, ja, my Lieblings.</i>

523
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,600
Let me grab you here.

524
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,890
We have work to do.

525
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:04,270
Hilda, my darling. Here, I have
written an important message...

526
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:08,400
...which must reach
Ernst Schlongdorf.

527
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,690
29 West Santiago Boulevard...

528
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:15,280
...Buenos Aires, Argentina.

529
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,410
AQAP.

530
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,240
As quick as possible.

531
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,410
Good.

532
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:26,120
Fly, Hilda. Fly!

533
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,790
Hilda, where are you going?

534
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,460
Argentina's that way!

535
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,220
Okay, chow time.

536
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:42,810
Yummy, yummy, yummy.
Goes right into your belly.

537
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,980
It's just a hunch,
but I'm betting this is our man.

538
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:50,560
Max, he's wearing a German helmet
and lederhosen.

539
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,610
Yeah, I know. Don't notice them.
Don't notice anything.

540
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:57,660
Always look straight ahead.
Remember, we need that play.

541
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,160
Franz Liebkind?

542
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,500
I was never a member
of the Nazi Party!

543
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,210
I only followed orders.

544
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,790
I had nothing to do with the war.

545
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,000
I didn't even know
there was a war on.

546
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,550
We lived in the back...

547
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,380
...right across from Switzerland.

548
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,880
All we ever heard was yodelling.

549
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:27,020
- Who are you?!
- Relax.

550
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,350
Mr. Liebkind,
we're not from the government.

551
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,860
We're producers,
Bialystock and Bloom...

552
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:34,820
...here to talk to you about your play.
- My play?

553
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,700
<i>You mean Springtime for...</i>

554
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:40,360
...you-know-who?
- That's the one.

555
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,700
- What about it?
- We love it. Don't we love it?

556
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,290
- We think it's a masterpiece.
- We want to put it on Broadway.

557
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:51,040
Broadway! Oh, joy of joys.

558
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,710
Dream of dreams. I can't believe it.

559
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:56,380
- I must tell my birds.
- Tell your birds.

560
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:00,220
Otto, Bertha, Heinz,
Heidi, Wolfgang...

561
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,600
...Adolf.

562
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,260
Do you hear?

563
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,890
We are finally going to clear
the Führer's name.

564
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,310
Broadway!

565
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,980
You know,
not many people know this...

566
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:18,900
...but the Führer was a terrific dancer.
- Really?

567
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:22,950
- We didn't know that, did we, Leo?
- No, no, we sure didn't.

568
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:26,870
That's because you were taken in
by the BBC!

569
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:30,160
Filthy British lies!

570
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,920
But did they ever say a bad word
about Winston Churchill?

571
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,420
Churchill!

572
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:42,890
With his cigars, with his brandy
and his rotten paintings.

573
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,600
Rotten!

574
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,100
Hitler.

575
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,970
There was a painter.

576
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:51,100
He could paint an entire apartment
in one afternoon.

577
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,230
Two coats.

578
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:55,730
Yes. Yes.

579
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:58,230
Yes, of course he could,
Mr. Liebkind.

580
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:01,240
And that is exactly why
we wanna produce your play.

581
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,620
Show the world the true Hitler.
The Hitler you loved...

582
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:08,450
...the Hitler you knew,
the Hitler with a song in his heart.

583
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:11,710
Here, Franz Liebkind.
Sign here...

584
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:14,130
...and make your dream a reality.

585
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,380
<i>- No.
- That's what "nein" means.</i>

586
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:21,550
First you must prove to me
that you believe as I believe...

587
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:26,300
...by joining with me and singing and
dancing the Führer's favourite tune:

588
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,470
" Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop."

589
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,810
I know.

590
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:33,310
- " Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop"?
- " Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop."

591
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,520
No. I could never sing
the Führer's favourite...

592
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,900
Delighted. Delighted.

593
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,730
...song.
- Shut up, he's almost ready to sign.

594
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:43,320
All right. First you will roll up
your pants.

595
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,160
- Rolling?
- Rolling.

596
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,620
- Don't be stingy. Show some leg.
- Alrighty.

597
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,080
- Good.
- Good.

598
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,210
- Key of E?
- Is there any other?

599
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:02,010
<i>Guten Tag hop hop
Guten Tag clop clop</i>

600
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,800
<i>Ach, du lieber
Und oh, boy</i>

601
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,680
<i>Guten Tag clap clap
Guten Tag slap slap</i>

602
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,480
<i>Ach, du lieber
What a joy</i>

603
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:17,100
<i>Oh, wir essen und fressen
Und tanzen und trink en</i>

604
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,860
<i>Tanzen und trink en
Until we get stinkin'</i>

605
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,740
<i>- Everybody!
- Guten Tag hop hop</i>

606
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,400
<i>Guten Tag clop clop</i>

607
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:29,410
<i>Guten Tag
Mein lieber Schatz</i>

608
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:33,120
<i>So we hop our hops
Und we clop our clops</i>

609
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,710
<i>Und we drink our Schnaps
Till we platz</i>

610
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:40,500
You will sway?

611
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:44,300
We will sway.

612
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,390
Follow me.

613
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,430
Very good.

614
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,250
Whatever you say.

615
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,920
<i>This is a tricky one</i>

616
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:36,600
Oh, the Hop-Clop.
It's been so long!

617
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:43,900
Sort of a Nazi hoedown.

618
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,290
Gentlemen, you may
produce my play.

619
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:57,080
Excellent. Excellent.

620
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,580
Here we are. Here.

621
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,590
But only if you take
the Siegfried Oath.

622
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,630
The Siegfried Oath?
What's that?

623
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:09,260
A pledge of eternal allegiance
to our beloved Führer.

624
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,760
Never...

625
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,050
...took that oath before.

626
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:16,680
<i>One for me, one for you,
und one for you.</i>

627
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:20,230
Never... Had one of those on before.
Thanks very much.

628
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:22,730
- You're welcome.
- Nice colours.

629
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,650
Oh, look, reversible.

630
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:27,320
- Oh, yeah, you're right.
- Max.

631
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,070
Max, we never
should have started this.

632
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,410
I think we're getting in too deep.

633
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,620
Too deep? This is nothing.

634
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,500
I'll tell you when
we're getting in too deep.

635
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:39,210
All right.

636
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,920
First, you will raise
your right forefinger...

637
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:44,170
<i>...und repeat after me.</i>

638
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,750
I solemnly swear...

639
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:50,590
- I solemnly swear...
- I solemnly swear...

640
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:53,840
...to obey the sacred Siegfried Oath.

641
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,020
...to obey the sacred Siegfried Oath.
...to obey the sacred Siegfried Oath.

642
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:00,020
<i>- Und...
- Und...</i>

643
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,440
<i>Und...</i>

644
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:03,850
...never, never, never...

645
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:07,650
...never, never, never...
...never, never, never...

646
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:15,120
<i>...dishonour the spirit und the memory
of Adolf Elizabeth Hitler.</i>

647
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:18,490
<i>...dishonour the spirit und the...
...dishonour the spirit und the...</i>

648
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:20,040
- Elizabeth?
- Elizabeth?

649
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,170
<i>Ja, that was his middle name.</i>

650
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,040
Not many people know this...

651
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:32,550
...but the Führer was descended
from a long line of English queens.

652
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,100
Is that right?

653
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,890
Yes.

654
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:45,230
- Adolf Elizabeth Hitler.
- Adolf Elizabeth Hitler.

655
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:48,820
- Good. Now I sign your contract.
- Excellent! Excellent.

656
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:52,110
Here we are, sir.
Right here on the dotted line.

657
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:54,740
There you are.
You shall never regret this.

658
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,910
So thank you, Herr Liebkind.
Alrighty, then.

659
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,990
Thank you.

660
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:05,170
Let it go. Let it go.

661
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,000
Halt!

662
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,590
I forgot to tell you.

663
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:14,260
The penalty for breaking
the Siegfried Oath...

664
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,590
...is dess.

665
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:18,600
" Dess"?

666
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,510
<i>Is that anything like "death"?</i>

667
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:23,140
Yeth.

668
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,440
Sorry to hear that. Don't worry...

669
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,730
...we'll iron out all these
thorny details over strudel.

670
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:32,070
Ta-ta, big guy. Here we go...

671
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:38,780
We're trapped! Trapped!

672
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,790
Got it.

673
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,790
Let's have lunch.

674
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:48,420
What nice guys.

675
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,040
Broadway.

676
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:54,380
I haven't been so happy
since we crushed Poland.

677
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:00,640
Hello, the living room of
renowned theatrical director...

678
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,640
<i>...Roger DeBris' elegant
Upper East Side townhouse...</i>

679
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,230
...on a sunny Tuesday
afternoon in June.

680
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:09,940
Who may I say is calling?

681
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,610
Listen, you broken- down
old queen...

682
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:15,070
...he was drunk, he was hot,
you got lucky.

683
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:17,450
- Don't ever call here again.
- Who was that?

684
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,700
Wrong number.

685
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,460
Yes?

686
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,200
Well, hi there.

687
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:02,780
I'm Max Bialystock and this
is my associate, Mr. Bloom.

688
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,700
We have an appointment
with renowned theatrical director...

689
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:08,540
...Roger DeBris.
- Ah, yes. Yes, please come in.

690
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,460
- Please. Yes.
- Thank you.

691
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:24,140
I am Carmen Ghia...

692
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,680
...Mr. DeBris'
common-law assistant.

693
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,060
You are expected.

694
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:41,070
May I take your hat, your coat
and your swastikas?

695
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:44,740
Oh, these. We... We...

696
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:48,660
We just came from this big rally.
Everybody was wearing them.

697
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,880
- You didn't tell me we had those on?
- I didn't notice them.

698
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:58,760
- You told me to look straight ahead.
- Yes, all right. Let's not fight. Okay?

699
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:05,100
Oh, Roger.

700
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:08,270
We're not alone.

701
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:22,950
Here's Roger.

702
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:31,710
- Max, he's wearing a dress.
- No kidding.

703
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:33,870
Roger, good to see you again.

704
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:37,210
Messrs. Bialystock and Bloom,
I presume?

705
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:39,300
Forgive the pun.

706
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:43,470
- What pun?
- Shut up. He thinks he's witty.

707
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:48,310
Roger, may I say you look gorgeous.
Absolutely gorgeous.

708
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:52,520
<i>By the way, Max, darling,
we loved Funny Boy, didn't we?</i>

709
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,810
Worshipped it.

710
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:56,310
<i>To be or not to be
You mean a lot to me</i>

711
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:58,770
- Showstopper!
- Fabulous.

712
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,780
Oh, dear. Your Mr. Bloom
is staring at my gown.

713
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,490
- Well, I was...
- I should explain.

714
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:09,490
I'm going to the Choreographers' Ball.
There is a prize for best costume.

715
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:13,620
- We always win.
- I'm not so sure about this year.

716
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:16,880
I'm supposed to be
the Grand Duchess Anastasia...

717
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:20,340
...but I think I look more like
the Chrysler Building.

718
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:25,510
Well, as far as I'm concerned, without
your wig on, you're only half dressed.

719
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:28,970
Well, then,
why don't you go and get it...

720
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:32,730
...oh, Wicked Witch of the West.

721
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:37,230
If your intention...

722
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:42,190
...was to shoot an arrow
through my heart...

723
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,650
...bull's- eye!

724
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,080
Oh, Roger, let's face it,
that building is you.

725
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,040
Listen, I know we sent it to you
only this morning...

726
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,330
<i>...but did you read
Springtime for Hitler?</i>

727
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:00,800
Read it? I devoured it.

728
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:03,340
And I find it remarkable.
Remarkable!

729
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:07,470
I feel it is a very important piece,
drenched with historical goodies.

730
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:10,890
I, for one, for instance,
never realized that the Third Reich...

731
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:13,140
...meant Germany.

732
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,730
Yeah, how about that.
Then you'll do it?

733
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:20,110
Do it? Of course not. It's not my
kind of thing. I mean, Max, please.

734
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:24,440
World War II?
Too dark, too depressing.

735
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,490
<i>The theatre's so obsessed
With dramas so depressed</i>

736
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:30,700
<i>It's hard to sell a tick et on Broadway</i>

737
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:34,370
<i>Shows should be more pretty
Shows should be more witty</i>

738
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:36,160
<i>Shows should be more</i>

739
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,620
<i>What's the word?</i>

740
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:41,710
- Gay?
- Exactly.

741
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:45,710
<i>No matter what you do on the stage</i>

742
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:49,220
<i>Keep it light, k eep it bright
Keep it gay</i>

743
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:53,180
<i>Whether it's murder
Mayhem or rage</i>

744
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:57,600
<i>Don't complain, it's a pain
Keep it gay</i>

745
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,110
<i>People want laughter
When they see a show</i>

746
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:04,610
<i>The last thing they're after is
A litany of woe</i>

747
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:08,610
<i>A happy ending
Will pep up your play</i>

748
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:10,490
<i>Oedipus won't bomb</i>

749
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:12,320
<i>If he winds up with Mom</i>

750
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,200
<i>- Keep it gay

751
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,620
<i>- Keep it gay
- Keep it gay</i>

752
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,120
Couldn't agree more.

753
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,960
And you have our blessings,
Roger...

754
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:24,130
<i>...to make Springtime for Hitler just
as gay as anyone could possibly want.</i>

755
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:25,800
So come on, do it for us. Please.

756
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:29,090
I'm sorry, Max.
It's simply not my cup of tea.

757
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:31,890
Still, fair is fair.

758
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,470
I should ask my production team
what they think.

759
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:36,180
Your production team,
who are they?

760
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:38,480
You'll see. They all live here.

761
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:41,980
Guys! Come say hello
to Bialystock and Bloom!

762
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:44,520
This is my set designer, Brian.

763
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,730
Hello.

764
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:49,110
<i>Keep it mad, k eep it glad

00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:53,160

- Hello.

766
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:57,080
<i>Keep it happy, k eep it snappy

767
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:00,870

768
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:04,590
<i>That everything's perfect
For Mr. DeBris</i>

00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,960
Scott, my choreographer.

770
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,840
Hi there.

771
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:27,900
And, finally, last and least...

772
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:32,030
...my lighting designer,
Shirley Markowitz.

773

<i>Keep it gay</i>

775
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:47,210
<i>Now, they all just read Springtime.
What did you think of it, fellas?</i>

776
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:49,380
<i>- It needs glamour
- And glitz</i>

777
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:52,880
<i>- It needs sequins
- And tits</i>

778

Leo. Leo, I think we're losing them.

779
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:59,770
Go say something nice to Roger.
I think he likes you.

780
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,060
- But, Max...
- Go on. It's just show biz.

781
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:12,360
Mr. DeBris. Roger.

782
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:16,070
Roger, actually,
I think your gown is very stunning.

783
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:17,990
Why, thank you, Mr. Bloom.

784
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:20,080
Leo.

785
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,910
What is that enchanting
cologne you're wearing?

786
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:25,750
Me? I'm not wearing any cologne.

787
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:29,380
You mean that smell is you?

788
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:31,710
Oh, God.

789
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:38,140
If I could bottle you, I'd shove you
under my armpits every day.

790
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,770
Oh, Max.
Max, we never should've started this.

791
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:54,110
- I think we're getting in too deep.
- Too deep? This is nothing.

792
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:56,610
I'll tell you when
we're getting in too deep.

793
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,120
<i>And so the rule is</i>

00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:05,750
<i>Keep it gay</i>

797
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:10,000
- What should we do?
- Relax. Watch this.

798
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,460
Roger, l...

799
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:17,470
<i>I think that Springtime for Hitler would
be a marvellous opportunity for you.</i>

800
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:20,640
I mean, up to now,
you've always been associated with...

801
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,810
Dare I say it? ...frivolous musicals.

802
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,980
You're right.
I've often felt as though...

803
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:27,980
...l've been throwing my life away
on silly entertainments.

804
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,860
Dopey showgirls in gooey gowns.

805
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:33,650
Two, three, kick, turn, turn, turn,
kick, turn.

806
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,610
- Roger.
- It's enough to make you heave.

807
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:39,160
<i>Nonetheless, I'm sorry, Max, I just
couldn't do Springtime for Hitler.</i>

808
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:41,160
- Why not? Think of the respect.
- No.

809
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,990
- Think of the prestige.
- No, no, no.

810
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:44,660
Think of the Tony!

811
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:49,500
<i>Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony</i>

812
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,380
- What's the matter?
- Is he all right?

813
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:52,800
- He's having a stroke.
- What?

814
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:55,170
- Of genius!
- I see it at last.

815
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:57,470
The chance
to do something important.

816

<i>Roger DeBris presents

817
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,010
Of course that second act
has to be rewritten.

818
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:06,560

that's too downbeat.

- Please.

This is a very big decision.

00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:54,410
<i>When you got it</i>

925
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,200
<i>Shout it</i>

926
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:00,370
<i>Let the whole world hear
What you're about</i>

927
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:03,710
<i>Clothes may make the man
All a girl needs is a tan</i>

928
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:08,300
<i>When you got it
Let it hang out</i>

929
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:10,460
- Remember when Ulla dance?
- Yeah.

930
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:11,880
Ulla dance again.

931
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:15,720
Ulla dance again!

932
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:35,820
<i>When I was just a little girl
In Sweden</i>

933
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:39,910
<i>My thoughtful mother
Gave me this advice</i>

934
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:43,910
<i>If nature blesses you
From top to bottom</i>

935
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:47,000
<i>Show that top to bottom
Don't think twice</i>

936
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,340
Now Ulla belt.

937
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:53,420
<i>Don't think twice!</i>

938
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:55,890
<i>When you got it</i>

939
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,720
<i>Share it</i>

940
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:01,810
<i>Let the public feast
Upon your charms</i>

941
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:05,690
<i>People say that being prim
Is proper</i>

942
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:09,190
<i>But every showgirl knows
That prim will stop her</i>

943
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:11,730
<i>When you got it</i>

944
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:13,690
<i>Give it</i>

945
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:18,870
<i>Don't be selfish
Give it all away</i>

946
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:25,290
<i>Don't be shy
Be bold and cute</i>

947
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:27,290
<i>Show the boys your birthday suit</i>

948
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:30,630
<i>When you got it</i>

949
01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:34,590
<i>If you got it</i>

950
01:01:35,370 --> 01:01:38,510
<i>Once you got it</i>

951
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:40,970
<i>Shout out</i>

952
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:47,560
<i>Hooray!</i>

953
01:01:54,810 --> 01:01:56,400
Okey- dokey.

954
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:57,820
You like it?

955
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:00,320
Like... Like it?

956
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,080
I want you to know, my dear,
that even though we're sitting down...

957
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:08,330
...we're giving you
a standing ovation.

958
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:15,840
She's in the show.

959
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:21,010
Wait, Max. Max, we don't even know
if there's a part for her in the show.

960
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:24,180
Would you excuse us, my dear?

961
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:26,180
Nonsense, Bloom.

962
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:28,350
Bloom,
do I have to teach you everything?

963
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:30,980
There is always a part
for the producer's girlfriend.

964
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:33,860
But we don't even know
when we're starting rehearsal yet.

965
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:38,070
So what? So what?
We're producers, aren't we?

966
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:41,200
So until she goes into the show,
she can work for us here.

967
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:46,200
<i>Because we need...
Nay, deserve to have ourselves a...</i>

968
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:51,630
<i>Deserve to have ourselves a gorgeous
Swedish secretary/receptionist.</i>

969
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:55,710
But, Max, a secretary who doesn't
speak English? What will people say?

970
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:57,720
They'll say:

971
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:02,470
Offer her the job, please?

972
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:04,850
Just a moment, miss.

973
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:08,020
We might have a position for you.

974
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:12,190
As a matter of fact, we might
have several positions for you.

975
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:13,900
Until the show gets going...

976
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:18,570
...we can offer you a job here
as a secretary/receptionist.

977
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:22,160
Secretary/receptionist?

978
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:24,910
Okey/dokey!

979
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:26,330
I can do that.

980
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:30,790
Answer telephone.

981
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:33,000
Bialystock and Bloom.

982
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,840
Bialystock and Bloom.

983
01:03:34,990 --> 01:03:36,300
Smart as a whip.

984
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:38,630
You're hired!

985
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:47,260
Well... Well, all right. If he says so,
I don't have a...

986
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:51,810
Secretary/receptionist.

987
01:03:51,970 --> 01:03:54,440
And maybe you can tidy up
around here a little bit too.

988
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,520
Tidy up? Tidy up.

989
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:59,070
Such a funny word.
What means "tidy up"?

990
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:01,950
- You know, clean.
- Make look nice.

991
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:05,620
- Oh, yeah. Ulla can make tidy up.
- Very good.

992
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:07,950
What time can you be here
in the morning?

993
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:11,410
Well, Ulla wake up every morning,
5 a.m.

994
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:14,080
From 5 to 7, Ulla like to exercise.

995
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:17,420
From to 7 to 8,
Ulla like to take long shower.

996
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:21,670
From to 8 to 9, Ulla like
to have big Swedish breakfast.

997
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:23,800
Many different herrings.

998
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,810
From to 9 to 11, Ulla like to practice
her singing and her dancing.

999
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:31,600
And at 11, Ulla like to have sex.

1000
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,150
What time should I get here?

1001
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,480
- Eleven.
- Eleven.

1002
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:38,400
Good. Ulla will come at 11.

1003
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:41,400
Ulla will come at 11.

1004
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:53,160
God bless America!

1005
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:58,290
God bless Sweden.

1006
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:02,170
Oh, Max. Max, she's fantastic.

1007
01:05:02,330 --> 01:05:04,970
The most beautiful girl
I've ever seen.

1008
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:06,760
I've never felt this way before.

1009
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:10,100
It's like a volcano erupting
inside of me...

1010
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:15,350
...like hot lava rising higher
and higher and...

1011
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:17,480
What is that, Max?

1012
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,820
What is it?

1013
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:25,240
It's called an erection.
It's either that or malaria.

1014
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:28,370
But don't worry,
they have shots for everything now.

1015
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,830
Come here,
I want to show you something.

1016
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,040
- What do you see?
- Nothing.

1017
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:37,630
Exactly. But now that we've got
our sure- fire flop...

1018
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:41,130
...it's gonna be our job
to fill that safe with 2 million dollars.

1019
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:45,130
Two million?
Gee, how much do we put in?

1020
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:59,360
How much...?
How much do we put in?

1021
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:01,270
Bloom...

1022
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:04,860
...the two cardinal rules
of being a Broadway producer...

1023
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:08,410
...are one, never put
your own money in the show.

1024
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,820
And two?

1025
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:15,660
Never put your own money
in the show!

1026
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,670
- Get it?
- Got it.

1027
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:20,880
- Good.
- So how do we raise the money?

1028
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:23,750
How? I'll tell you how.

1029
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,420
From my investors.

1030
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:28,470
Hundreds of little old ladies...

1031
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:33,760
...all looking to Max Bialystock for one
last thrill on their way to the cemetery.

1032
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:37,810
So in the days to come, Bloom,
you shall see very little of me.

1033
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:40,350
And right now,
I'd like to see very little of you.

1034
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:42,570
Scram while I get myself ready.

1035
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:46,610
For Max Bialystock
is about to launch himself...

1036
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:49,240
...into little- old-lady land.

1037
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:53,660
<i>The time has come</i>

1038
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:58,250
<i>To be a lover from the Argentine</i>

1039
01:06:58,410 --> 01:07:02,960
<i>To slick my hair down
With brilliantine</i>

1040
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:09,630
<i>And gargle heavily
With Listerine</i>

1041
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:18,560
<i>It's time for Max</i>

1042
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:23,690
<i>To put his back ers on their backs</i>

1043
01:07:23,850 --> 01:07:29,280
<i>And thrill them with amazing acts</i>

1044
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,200
<i>Those aging nymphomaniacs</i>

1045
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:45,590
<i>They were helpless
They were hopeless</i>

1046
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:49,260
<i>Then along came Bialy</i>

1047
01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:53,090
<i>They were joyless
They were boy-less</i>

1048
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:56,720
<i>Then along came Bialy</i>

1049
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,560
<i>They're my angels
I'm their devil</i>

1050
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:04,440
<i>And I k eep those embers aglow</i>

1051
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:08,190
<i>When I woos 'em
I can't lose 'em</i>

1052
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:10,490
<i>'Cause I cast my spell
And they start yellin'</i>

1053
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,030
<i>"Fire down below!"</i>

1054
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:15,740
<i>So romantic
They were frantic</i>

1055
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:19,750
<i>Then their prayers were heard
Up above</i>

1056
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:21,620
<i>Heaven sent them</i>

1057
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:23,500
<i>Their Bialy</i>

1058
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:30,380
<i>I'm the celebration of love</i>

1059
01:08:37,710 --> 01:08:40,640
<i>Who is it? Who is it?</i>

1060
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,640
It's Max Bialystock.

1061
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,690
Maxy.

1062
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:07,730
Fire down below!

1063
01:10:07,890 --> 01:10:10,650
<i>We were listing
We were sinking</i>

1064
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:14,240
<i>Then along came Bialy</i>

1065
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:17,530
<i>We were desperate
We were drinking</i>

1066
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:21,080
<i>- Then along came Bialy
- Who's your daddy?</i>

1067
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:24,410
<i>So romantic
We were frantic</i>

1068
01:10:24,570 --> 01:10:28,000
<i>Then our prayers were heard
Up above</i>

1069
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,540
<i>It's Bialy</i>

1070
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:31,210
<i>Hey, Bialy</i>

1071
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:33,340
<i>He's the culmination</i>

1072
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,050
<i>The restoration</i>

1073
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:36,760
<i>The consummation</i>

1074
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,220
<i>The titillation</i>

1075
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:39,840
<i>Ejaculation</i>

1076
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,810
<i>He's the celebration of love</i>

1077
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:03,870
Thank you.

1078
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:16,960
Bloom! Bloom!

1079
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,260
What, Max? What?

1080
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:22,140
I've done it. I've done it,
I've raised the 2 million.

1081
01:11:22,290 --> 01:11:25,180
Now all we have to do is put on
the biggest flop in history.

1082
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:27,640
That's great!

1083
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:39,240
<i>We can't miss</i>

1084
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:03,590
I gotta make the next payment
on the theatre by 3:00 or else...

1085
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:05,050
Sorry, wrong office.

1086
01:12:05,210 --> 01:12:07,180
Bialystock. Bloom.

1087
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:09,770
Max. Leo.

1088
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:27,450
- Ulla?
- Ulla?

1089
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:29,540
What happened to the office?

1090
01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:32,710
Like you tell Ulla, "tidy up."

1091
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:35,210
Tidy "oop"?

1092
01:12:35,370 --> 01:12:37,380
How did you find the time
to do all this?

1093
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:41,010
- I skip lunch.
- Of course you did.

1094
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:43,930
- Very nice.
- She skipped lunch.

1095
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,890
Almost 3.
That payment to the Shuberts.

1096
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:47,600
I'll get the cash from the safe.

1097
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:49,890
You make sure
all those contracts are signed.

1098
01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:51,390
Yes, Max.

1099
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:55,440
She painted over the numbers.

1100
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,450
Hello, boys.

1101
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:16,380
Nobody knows
what I went through to get you.

1102
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:18,040
Ulla knows.

1103
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:22,420
You had to shtupp
every little old lady in New York.

1104
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:26,760
That's right. That's right.

1105
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:30,560
And I've still got
the denture bites to prove it.

1106
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:35,600
Work, work, work. Work, work, work.

1107
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:42,110
So, Mr. Bloom.

1108
01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:44,610
We are all alone.

1109
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:47,700
Yes, we are, aren't we?

1110
01:13:53,450 --> 01:13:56,920
Why Bloom go so far camera right?

1111
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:00,500
Bloom no like Ulla?

1112
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:03,300
Ulla like Bloom.

1113
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:05,930
Bloom like Ulla, all right.

1114
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:09,140
- Maybe a little too much.
- Good.

1115
01:14:09,290 --> 01:14:11,430
I'm glad.

1116
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:15,430
Why Bloom need blue blanket?

1117
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:17,310
Oh, it's not important.

1118
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:19,520
It's just a minor compulsion.
It's that I've...

1119
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:22,530
I've had it ever since
I was a baby, and I...

1120
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:25,650
You're a little too close.

1121
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:31,660
<i>The urge to merge
Can rob us of our senses</i>

1122
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:36,540
<i>The need to breed
Can make a man a drone</i>

1123
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:41,170
<i>We must be on alert
With our defences</i>

1124
01:14:41,330 --> 01:14:44,670
<i>For every skirt will test</i>

1125
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:49,680
<i>Testosterone</i>

1126
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,680
<i>So knowing this
I severed all connection</i>

1127
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,270
<i>With any creature
Sporting silk or lace</i>

1128
01:14:57,430 --> 01:15:01,860
<i>I was firmly headed
In the right direction</i>

1129
01:15:02,010 --> 01:15:06,280
<i>When suddenly I stumbled on</i>

1130
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:09,860
<i>That face</i>

1131
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,660
<i>That face
That face</i>

1132
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:15,950
<i>That dangerous face</i>

1133
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:20,370
<i>I mustn't be unwise</i>

1134
01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:22,710
<i>Those lips
That nose</i>

1135
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:25,050
<i>Those eyes</i>

1136
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:29,510
<i>Could lead to my demise</i>

1137
01:15:29,670 --> 01:15:31,720
<i>That face
That face</i>

1138
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:33,930
<i>That marvellous face</i>

1139
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:38,390
<i>I never should begin</i>

1140
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:40,690
<i>Those cheeks
That neck</i>

1141
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,900
<i>That chin</i>

1142
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:47,400
<i>Will surely do me in</i>

1143
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:49,740
<i>I must be smart
And hide my heart</i>

1144
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:52,110
<i>If she's within a mile</i>

1145
01:15:52,270 --> 01:15:55,120
<i>If I don't duck
I'm out of luck</i>

1146
01:15:55,280 --> 01:16:00,410
<i>She'd kill me with her smile</i>

1147
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:07,760
<i>That face
That face</i>

1148
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:09,920
<i>That fabulous face</i>

1149
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:14,430
<i>It's clear I must beware</i>

1150
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:16,640
<i>I'm certain if I fall in love</i>

1151
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,770
<i>I'm lost without a trace</i>

1152
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,270
<i>But it's worth it</i>

1153
01:16:20,430 --> 01:16:23,690
<i>For that face</i>

1154
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:27,070
Bloom help Ulla down?

1155
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:31,280
All right. Bloom help Ulla down.

1156
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:59,720
<i>That face</i>

1157
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,430

Shut up!

We must have some order here.

1176
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:35,730
Will all the dancing Hitlers
please wait off-stage right...

1177
01:20:35,890 --> 01:20:39,490
...and all the singing Hitlers
off-stage left.

1178
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:41,860
Get that way.

1179
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:45,030
Carmen,
call in a singing Hitler, please.

1180

1202
01:22:18,030 --> 01:22:22,250
<i>For the last 16 years, I have been

Good evening, sir. Nice to see you.

1252
01:25:01,070 --> 01:25:03,620
- Enjoy the show.
- Thank you.

1253
01:25:09,790 --> 01:25:11,340
- Oh, Mr. Bloom.
- Oh, Mr. Bloom.

- You look so handsome.
- Thank you.

Leo!

1256
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:22,230
Leo, who said
you could wear that hat?

1257
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:26,020
Nobody, Max. But I thought now that
I'm the producer of a Broadway show...

1258
01:25:26,180 --> 01:25:27,820
- Has the curtain gone up yet?
- No.

1259
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:29,940
- Has the curtain come down yet?
- No.

1260
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:32,490
Then you're not a producer yet.
Give me that hat.

1261
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:35,240
Mr. Bloom! Leo.

1262
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:38,030
Your tie is all askew.

1263
01:25:38,190 --> 01:25:40,580
Askew. Oh, thank you, Ulla.

1264
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:42,870
Have a good show.

1265
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:51,380
Roll them in the aisles.

1266
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:52,920
Okey- dokey.

1267
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:54,760
I will try to.

1268
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:57,970
But there's just so many of them.

1269
01:26:01,210 --> 01:26:04,230
Gee, I thought we were partners,
sharing everything 50-50.

1270
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:07,690
Now I'm out in the cold, and you two
are busy askewing each other.

1271
01:26:07,850 --> 01:26:09,360
Askewing? Never, Max.

1272
01:26:09,510 --> 01:26:12,860
Hugs and kisses, yes,
but that's as far as I go.

1273
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:25,750
Gunter, you will pick me up back here
right after the curtain.

1274
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:31,880
Oh, God, will they love us?
Will they hate us?

1275
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:33,260
The suspense is killing me.

1276
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:36,760
I know.
I feel like I'm going into labour.

wish everybody good luck.

- What? What did you say?
- Bite your tongue.

1280
01:26:51,890 --> 01:26:54,320
Well, what's the matter?
All I said was "good luck."

1281
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,740
- He said it again.
- Hasn't anyone ever told you?

1282

<i>What you say is "break a leg"</i>

1316
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:29,000
- Break a leg!
- Break a leg!

1317
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:47,310
Franz, what happened?

1318
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:50,520
I broke my leg.

1319
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:54,610
Now we'll have to cancel the show
and give everyone their money back.

1320
01:28:54,850 --> 01:28:56,360
Money back?

1321
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:57,730
Money back?

1322
01:28:57,890 --> 01:28:59,150
Money back.

1323
01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:01,280
Don't ever say that again.
Money back?

1324
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,200
Never.
We gotta think of something else.

1325
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:06,870
But Franz plays Hitler, Max,
and he has no understudy.

1326
01:29:07,030 --> 01:29:09,870
You're right. What are we gonna do?
There must be a way out.

1327
01:29:10,030 --> 01:29:12,750
If I could only think of something.
Some way. Some...

1328
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:16,040
Hold it. I got it.
Roger, you. You could play Hitler.

1329
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:17,670
You know every line in the show.

1330
01:29:17,830 --> 01:29:21,840
I've seen you at rehearsal, always
moving your lips along with the actors.

1331
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,720
It's an embarrassing habit.
I'm trying to break myself of it.

1332
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:27,560
But me play Hitler? No!
There's no way I could go on tonight.

1333
01:29:27,710 --> 01:29:30,060
I don't have the strength.
I don't have the courage.

1334
01:29:30,220 --> 01:29:32,230
I can't do it! I can't do it! I can't do it!

1335
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:34,400
- Wow, that hurt.
- Roger.

1336
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:36,190
Listen to me.

1337
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:38,020
You can do it.

1338
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:40,320
You know you can do it,
and I know you can do it.

1339
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:42,900
You've been waiting all your lifetime
for this chance.

1340
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:45,740
And I'm not gonna let you
pass it up.

1341
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:51,410
You're going out there a silly,
hysterical, screaming queen.

1342
01:29:51,570 --> 01:29:54,540
But you're coming back
a great big...

1344
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:01,590
All right. You're right.

1345
01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:04,090
I'll do it! By God, I'll do it!

1346
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:07,510
I've got to get into makeup.
Quick, get Franz's Hitler moustache.

1347
01:30:07,670 --> 01:30:11,720
And, oh! My lucky
Gloria Swanson mole.

1348
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:14,310
Got it!

1349

01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:39,420
- Max.
- What?

1352
01:30:39,620 --> 01:30:41,550
This is it!

1353
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:46,510
- Good luck, Leo.

01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:53,770
<i>I was just a paperhanger</i>

1411

<i>No one more obscurer</i>

1412
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:00,070
<i>Got a phone call from the Reichstag</i>

1413
01:36:00,230 --> 01:36:03,280
<i>Told me I was Führer</i>

1414

<i>Oh, what, oh, what to do?</i>

1416
01:36:08,950 --> 01:36:10,960
<i>Hitched up my pants</i>

1417
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:13,420
<i>And conquered France</i>

outrageous, insulting...

No way out!

1452
01:39:45,330 --> 01:39:47,260
How could this happen?

1453
01:39:47,420 --> 01:39:51,680
We picked the wrong play,
the wrong director, the wrong cast.

1454
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:54,350
Where did we go right?

...and I'm leaving.

1458
01:40:13,110 --> 01:40:15,830
Don't try and stop me.
I've made up my mind.

1459
01:40:15,990 --> 01:40:17,660
Wait. Where do you think
you're going?

1460
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:19,920
I'm turning myself in.
It's the only way.

1461
01:40:20,070 --> 01:40:21,710
I'm going to play ball with the IRS.

1462
01:40:21,870 --> 01:40:23,790
I'm going to cooperate
with the authorities.

1463
01:40:23,950 --> 01:40:26,760
They'll reduce my sentence,
there's time off for good behaviour.

1464
01:40:26,910 --> 01:40:28,840
Maybe I'll get a job
in the prison library.

1465
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,800
Please keep in touch.
It's been very nice working with you.

Frightened Leo. Nervous Leo, relax.

Take it easy, all right?

1469
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:43,690
You're overwrought.
You don't know what you're doing.

1470
01:40:43,850 --> 01:40:45,190
You're acting out of panic.

1471
01:40:45,350 --> 01:40:47,780
Give me those frigging books!
Give me!

1472

- Give me! Give me! Give me!
- I never should've listened to you.

1473

I was an honest man
before I met you.

1474

An honest man?
You were an honest mouse!

1475
01:40:57,900 --> 01:41:00,710
- Give me. Give me.
- How I hate you!

Double! Double! Double!

Fat! Fat!

1478
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:18,350
I'm not that fat.

1479
01:41:18,510 --> 01:41:20,060
Fat!

1480
01:41:22,470 --> 01:41:24,150
Fat!

1481
01:41:24,890 --> 01:41:26,610
Fatty!

1482
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:30,900
Fatso!
You fat, fat, fatty, fatty, fat walrus.

1483
01:41:31,060 --> 01:41:32,450
Give me the fat books!

1484
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:36,490

- Fat, fat, fatty, fat!

1485
01:41:36,860 --> 01:41:38,620
- Oh, Jesus!
- Give them to me!

1486
01:41:38,780 --> 01:41:40,000
Give me the books!

1487
01:41:40,150 --> 01:41:41,710
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

1488
01:41:41,860 --> 01:41:43,790
- Give it to me! Give it to me!
- No! No!

1489
01:41:43,950 --> 01:41:46,540
- Give it to me! Give it to me!
- No! No!

1490
01:41:46,700 --> 01:41:48,630
Now, that's what I call celebrating.

1491
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:52,550
You. You lousy fruit.

1492
01:41:52,710 --> 01:41:55,640
- You ruined me.
- You ungrateful breeder.

1493
01:41:55,790 --> 01:41:58,890
After he stepped in and saved
your little show, I cannot... My chains!

1494
01:41:59,050 --> 01:42:02,140
- Leave him alone!
- My Italian chains! My chains!

1495
01:42:06,930 --> 01:42:08,730
You have broken the Siegfried Oath.

1496
01:42:08,890 --> 01:42:11,190
You must die. You all must die!

1497
01:42:18,650 --> 01:42:21,540
What are you doing,
you neo- Nazi nitwit?

1498
01:42:21,700 --> 01:42:24,120
- Your show's a hit.
- Who cares?

1499
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:26,080
You made a fool out of Hitler.

1500
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:28,500
- He didn't need our help.
- He didn't need our help.

1501
01:42:31,660 --> 01:42:34,840
Stand still! How can I shoot you
if you keep moving?

1502
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,510
Get back here!

1503
01:42:37,670 --> 01:42:39,680
Under the desk! Under the desk!

1504
01:42:40,510 --> 01:42:43,600
- Darling, quick, back in the closet.
- Okay.

1505
01:42:48,180 --> 01:42:49,940
This is no good.

1506
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:52,650
I'm not killing anybody.

1507
01:42:52,930 --> 01:42:55,780
You must cooperate!

1508
01:42:58,020 --> 01:43:00,790
<i>All right, Bialystock und Bloom.</i>

1509
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:02,540
Now I got you.

1510
01:43:02,690 --> 01:43:04,290
Say your prayers!

1511
01:43:04,860 --> 01:43:06,870
Remember I'd tell you
when we're in too deep?

1512
01:43:07,030 --> 01:43:08,880
- Yeah?
- We're in too deep.

1513
01:43:09,910 --> 01:43:12,380
Franz, don't do it! Please, I beg you!

1514
01:43:12,540 --> 01:43:15,220
Oh, no, no.

1515
01:43:17,330 --> 01:43:19,720
You snivelling cowards!

1516
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:21,720
Cringing under a desk?

1517
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:26,020
Clinging to life like baby butterflies.

1518
01:43:26,180 --> 01:43:29,560
Franz Liebkind will show you
how to die like a man!

1519
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:40,030
Jammed.
Boy, when things go wrong...

1520
01:43:42,190 --> 01:43:45,330
That's it. Next time, no author.

1521
01:43:47,570 --> 01:43:49,790
What are you shooting
at us for anyway?

1522
01:43:49,950 --> 01:43:51,590
You Teutonic twit!

1523
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:55,090
Wait. Wait a minute.

1524
01:43:55,250 --> 01:43:56,760
I just got an idea.

1525
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:59,260
A way to close the show.

1526
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:01,970
Franz, l...

1527
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:08,060
- There, there.
- Where? Where?

1528
01:44:08,550 --> 01:44:10,350
Franz, listen to me.

1529
01:44:10,510 --> 01:44:12,900
Why don't you use this
where it'll do some good.

1530
01:44:13,060 --> 01:44:15,740
- Why don't you shoot the actors.
- The actors?

1531
01:44:15,890 --> 01:44:17,400
Yes, the actors.

1532
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:20,660
Everybody laughed at your
beloved Führer tonight, and why?

1533
01:44:20,810 --> 01:44:23,700
Because of the actors.
The actors were making fun of him.

1534
01:44:23,860 --> 01:44:25,370
Yeah, you're right, the actors!

1535
01:44:25,530 --> 01:44:28,460
Yes. Here, go, buy bullets.

1536
01:44:28,610 --> 01:44:32,590
- Kill. Kill all the actors.
- I must kill all the actors.

1537
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:35,300
Wait a minute!

1538
01:44:35,830 --> 01:44:37,630
What are you talking about?

1539
01:44:37,790 --> 01:44:40,590
What do you mean, "kill the actors"?
You can't kill the actors.

1540
01:44:40,750 --> 01:44:43,140
Actors are not animals.
They're human beings.

1541
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:45,350
They are?
Have you ever eaten with one?

1542
01:44:45,510 --> 01:44:48,140
- Here. Listen...
- Open up, it's the police!

1543
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:50,270
- The police!
- The police!

1544
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:52,940
Come on, boys.

1545
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:55,610
I was never a member
of the Nazi Party. I had nothing...

1546
01:44:55,770 --> 01:44:57,650
You, drop that gun.

1547
01:44:58,980 --> 01:45:00,490
- Ociffers!
- What's going on here?

1548
01:45:00,650 --> 01:45:02,160
This crazy Kraut is crackers!

1549
01:45:02,310 --> 01:45:04,490
He crashed in here
and crassly tried to kill us.

1550
01:45:04,650 --> 01:45:07,910
- Oh, Roger, what alliteration.
- Thank you, darling.

1551
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:12,080
Okay, youse two can go.

1552
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:14,210
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1553
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:16,840
Tried to kill him, eh?

1554
01:45:18,410 --> 01:45:20,170
Officer O'Rourke, take this man in.

1555
01:45:20,330 --> 01:45:21,840
Next stop, Sing Sing.

1556
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:26,930
Sing Sing?
You'll never take me alive!

1557
01:45:32,010 --> 01:45:36,440
- What happened?
- I broke my other leg.

1558
01:45:42,230 --> 01:45:45,870
All right, who are you,
and why was he trying to shoot you?

1559
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:49,870
I haven't the slightest idea,
Sergeant O'Toole.

1560
01:45:50,030 --> 01:45:53,210
The name is O'Bialystock.

1561
01:45:53,370 --> 01:45:57,380
I was just passing by on me way
to the Pat O'Brien Film Festival...

1562
01:45:57,540 --> 01:46:01,300
...and I ducked in to see
what the hell was going on.

1563
01:46:01,460 --> 01:46:06,390
And now I'll be on me way,
before me voice gets any higher.

1564
01:46:08,210 --> 01:46:11,390
As we say in the old country, "Taxi!"

1565
01:46:11,550 --> 01:46:12,850
Hold it!

1566
01:46:13,050 --> 01:46:14,560
Hey, sarge, look at this.

1567
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:16,940
- What?
- I found these two accounting books.

1568
01:46:17,100 --> 01:46:22,530
- This one says, "Show to the IRS."
- And what's the other one say?

1569
01:46:22,690 --> 01:46:25,660
" Never show to the IRS."

1570
01:46:25,810 --> 01:46:28,580
I think the three of you
better come downtown with me.

1571
01:46:28,730 --> 01:46:33,210
- Three?
- Yeah, you and them two books.

1572
01:46:40,370 --> 01:46:43,010
Mr. Bialystock?

1573
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:45,470
Mr. Bloom?

1574
01:46:45,630 --> 01:46:47,930
Where are you?

1575
01:46:48,090 --> 01:46:51,930
Everyone is waiting for you
at the opening-night party.

1576
01:46:52,090 --> 01:46:55,310
Ulla, help me.

1577
01:47:00,770 --> 01:47:03,440
What happened to you?

1578
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:05,990
I know.

1579
01:47:06,150 --> 01:47:10,200
You hung up your coat
while you were still in it.

1580
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:24,380
Thank you for helping me down.

1581
01:47:33,050 --> 01:47:34,680
What were you doing up there?

1582
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:36,140
Hiding.

1583
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:37,650
I was hiding.

1584
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:39,810
From who? From what?

1585
01:47:39,970 --> 01:47:41,190
From the police.

1586
01:47:41,350 --> 01:47:44,650
They were just here.
They've arrested Max.

1587
01:47:44,810 --> 01:47:47,150
- They found the books?
- I don't know what to do.

1588
01:47:47,310 --> 01:47:48,570
Poor Max.

1589
01:47:48,730 --> 01:47:51,490
Maybe I should turn myself in
and go to jail with him.

1590
01:47:51,650 --> 01:47:56,080
Well, my sweet cupcake,
I know we both love Max...

1591
01:47:56,410 --> 01:48:00,670
...but it seems to me
you have two choices.

1592
01:48:01,080 --> 01:48:05,340
Number one, you can go to jail
with Mr. Bialystock...

1593
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:09,760
...for years and years and years.

1594
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:12,600
Or number two...

1595
01:48:12,750 --> 01:48:18,270
...you can take that 2 million dollars
and Ulla, and go to Rio.

1596
01:48:18,430 --> 01:48:22,520
Oh, my God, what a dilemma.

1597
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:24,690
Oh, what should I do?

1598
01:48:24,850 --> 01:48:28,900
Should I go to jail or go to Rio?

1599
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:33,780
Mail call.

1600
01:48:34,150 --> 01:48:37,250
Hey, fatso.

1601
01:48:37,990 --> 01:48:40,170
I'm not that fat!

1602
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,040
Says you.

1603
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:44,380
You got a postcard.

1604
01:48:44,660 --> 01:48:46,630
A postcard? From where?

1605
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:48,800
Brazil.

1606
01:48:49,710 --> 01:48:51,640
Brazil.

1607
01:48:52,130 --> 01:48:54,680
Who do I know in Brazil?

1608
01:48:55,550 --> 01:48:58,060
Why am I asking you?

1609
01:49:03,010 --> 01:49:06,820
" Dear Max, Rio is everything
you said it was and more.

1610
01:49:08,390 --> 01:49:11,070
Ulla and I think of you
every chance we get.

1611
01:49:15,570 --> 01:49:18,580
<i>In the morning, when we
have breakfast on our terrace...</i>

1612
01:49:18,740 --> 01:49:20,370
<i>... many different herrings.</i>

1613
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:25,590
<i>In the afternoon, when we rub
each other's sun-drenched bodies...</i>

1614
01:49:25,740 --> 01:49:31,930
<i>... with banana-cream coconut oil,
number 15.</i>

1615
01:49:33,250 --> 01:49:38,140
<i>And then, in the evening, when
we samba together in the moonlight."</i>

1616
01:49:38,300 --> 01:49:41,600
<i>You'll find your happiness in Rio</i>

1617
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:45,020
<i>The beaches there
Are strewn with pearls</i>

1618
01:49:45,180 --> 01:49:48,530
<i>The tropic breezes
Always blow there</i>

1619
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:52,280
<i>And so, we hear
Do the girls</i>

1620
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:56,030
<i>"Sorry, must run. Ulla's waiting.</i>

1621
01:49:56,270 --> 01:49:59,290
<i>It's almost 11.</i>

1622
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:03,290
<i>Wish you were here.</i>

1623
01:50:03,450 --> 01:50:07,800
<i>Your pal, Leo."</i>

1624
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:10,970
<i>Just like Cain and Abel</i>

1625
01:50:11,120 --> 01:50:13,550
<i>You pulled a sneak attack</i>

1626
01:50:13,710 --> 01:50:16,300
<i>I thought that we were brothers</i>

1627
01:50:16,460 --> 01:50:20,060
<i>Then you stabbed me in the back</i>

1628
01:50:20,220 --> 01:50:24,230
<i>Betrayed</i>

1629
01:50:24,390 --> 01:50:27,900
<i>Oh, boy, I'm so betrayed</i>

1630
01:50:28,770 --> 01:50:31,570
<i>Like Samson and Delilah
Your love began to fade</i>

1631
01:50:31,730 --> 01:50:34,410
<i>I'm crying in the hoosegow
You're in Rio getting laid</i>

1632
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:36,570
<i>Betrayed</i>

1633
01:50:36,730 --> 01:50:40,490
<i>Let's face it, I'm betrayed</i>

1634
01:50:40,820 --> 01:50:46,330
<i>Boy, have I been tak en</i>

1635
01:50:46,700 --> 01:50:50,670
<i>Oy, I'm so forsak en</i>

1636
01:50:50,830 --> 01:50:52,380
<i>I should have seen
What came to pass</i>

1637
01:50:52,540 --> 01:50:54,130
<i>I should have known
To watch my ass</i>

1638
01:50:54,290 --> 01:50:56,890
<i>I feel like Othello
Everything is lost</i>

1639
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:58,350
<i>Leo is lago</i>

1640
01:50:58,500 --> 01:50:59,890
<i>Max is double-crossed</i>

1641
01:51:00,050 --> 01:51:01,680
<i>I'm so dismayed</i>

1642
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:04,020
<i>Did I mention I'm betrayed?</i>

1643
01:51:04,180 --> 01:51:07,190
<i>Now I'm about to go to jail
There's no one who will pay my bail</i>

1644
01:51:07,350 --> 01:51:11,150
<i>I have no one who I can cry to
No one I can say goodbye to</i>

1645
01:51:11,890 --> 01:51:13,820
I'm drowning!

1646
01:51:13,980 --> 01:51:15,530
I'm drowning!

1647
01:51:15,690 --> 01:51:17,530
I'm drowning here!

1648
01:51:17,690 --> 01:51:21,370
I'm going down for the last time.

1649
01:51:21,990 --> 01:51:26,540
I can see my whole life
flashing before my eyes.

1650
01:51:26,820 --> 01:51:32,550
I see a weathered old farmhouse
with a white picket fence.

1651
01:51:32,750 --> 01:51:37,260
I'm running through fields
of alfalfa with my collie, Rex.

1652
01:51:37,420 --> 01:51:40,350
No, Rex, not on the alfalfa.

1653
01:51:42,710 --> 01:51:44,560
And I see my mother.

1654
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:48,400
I see Mama standing
on the back porch...

1655
01:51:48,550 --> 01:51:51,480
...in a worn but clean
gingham gown.

1656
01:51:51,640 --> 01:51:54,900
And I hear my mama
calling out to me.

1657
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:56,450
Alvin!

1658
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:58,610
Don't forget your chores.

1659
01:51:58,770 --> 01:52:01,740
The wood needs a-cording
and the cows need a-milking.

1660
01:52:01,900 --> 01:52:04,750
Alvin! Alvin!

1661
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:07,580
Wait a minute.

1662
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:09,920
My name's not Alvin.

1663
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:12,290
That's not my life.

1664
01:52:12,700 --> 01:52:16,340
Somebody else's life
is flashing before my eyes.

1665
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:21,220
What the hell is that about?

1666
01:52:21,460 --> 01:52:24,600
I'm not a hillbilly.
I grew up in the Bronx.

1667
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:28,770
Leo's taken everything,
even my past.

1668
01:52:28,970 --> 01:52:34,860
<i>My past's a dying ember</i>

1669
01:52:35,020 --> 01:52:39,570
<i>But wait, now I remember</i>

1670
01:52:39,730 --> 01:52:42,160
<i>How did it begin?
He walk ed into my office</i>

1671
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:43,950
<i>With his cockamamie scheme</i>

1672
01:52:44,110 --> 01:52:46,540
<i>You can make more money
With a flop than with a hit</i>

1673
01:52:46,700 --> 01:52:49,040
<i>We can do it
We can do it</i>

1674
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:51,290
<i>I can't do it
We can do it</i>

1675
01:52:51,450 --> 01:52:54,130
<i>I can't do it
Goodbye, Max</i>

1676
01:52:54,290 --> 01:52:56,800
<i>Lord, I want that money
I'm back, Max</i>

1677
01:52:56,960 --> 01:52:58,300
<i>Come on, Leo, we can do it</i>

1678
01:52:58,460 --> 01:53:00,470
<i>Step one, find the play</i>

1679
01:53:00,630 --> 01:53:03,640
<i>See it, smell it, touch it, kiss it
Hello, Mr. Liebkind</i>

1680
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:05,140
<i>Guten Tag hop hop
Guten Tag clop clop</i>

1681

<i>Step two, hire the director
Keep it gay, k eep it gay, k eep it...</i>

1684
01:53:12,430 --> 01:53:14,570
<i>Two, three, kick,
Turn, turn, turn, kick, turn</i>

01:53:17,020 --> 01:53:18,900
<i>Step three, raise the money</i>

1687
01:53:19,190 --> 01:53:21,410
<i>Along came Bialy</i>

1688
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:23,910
<i>Step four, hire all the actors</i>

1689

<i>A wandering minstrel I
A thing of shreds and...</i>

<i>Next

1691
01:53:28,820 --> 01:53:30,660
<i>Next
That's our Hitler</i>

1692
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:33,330
<i>Break a leg
I broke my leg</i>

1693
01:53:33,490 --> 01:53:35,590
<i>Springtime for Hitler and Germany</i>

1694
01:53:35,740 --> 01:53:38,960
<i>A surprise smash
Springtime for Hitler and Germany</i>

1695
01:53:39,120 --> 01:53:41,550
<i>It'll run for years!
Where did we go right?</i>

1696
01:53:41,710 --> 01:53:43,470
<i>Where did we go right?</i>

1697
01:53:43,670 --> 01:53:45,390
<i>Give me those books
Fat, fat, fatty</i>

1698
01:53:45,550 --> 01:53:47,260
<i>Give me those books
Fat, fat, fatty</i>

1699
01:53:47,420 --> 01:53:50,020
<i>Books, fat, books, fat
Books, fat, books, fat</i>

1700
01:53:50,180 --> 01:53:51,690
<i>Lousy fruit
Kill the actors</i>

1701
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:53,480
<i>You ever eat with one?</i>

1702
01:53:53,640 --> 01:53:56,650
<i>Then you ran to Rio
And you're safely out of reach</i>

1703
01:53:56,810 --> 01:53:58,190
<i>I'm behind these bars</i>

1704
01:53:58,350 --> 01:54:03,200
<i>You're banging Ulla on the beach</i>

1705
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:06,950
<i>Just like Julius Caesar</i>

1706
01:54:07,110 --> 01:54:09,370
<i>Was betrayed by Brutus</i>

1707
01:54:09,570 --> 01:54:12,920
<i>Who'd think an accountant
Would turn out to be my Judas</i>

1708
01:54:13,070 --> 01:54:15,630
<i>I'm so dismayed</i>

1709
01:54:15,780 --> 01:54:20,050
<i>Is this how I'm repaid?</i>

1710
01:54:20,210 --> 01:54:22,220
<i>To be</i>

1711
01:54:22,370 --> 01:54:29,850
<i>Betrayed</i>

1712
01:54:30,010 --> 01:54:32,180
<i>Betrayed</i>

1713
01:54:34,510 --> 01:54:38,020
Gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached your verdict?

1714
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:41,740
Yes, Your Honour, we have.

1715
01:54:42,020 --> 01:54:44,200
We find the defendant...

1716
01:54:44,350 --> 01:54:46,570
...incredibly guilty.

1717
01:54:49,740 --> 01:54:52,040
Hold me, touch me.

1718
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:55,500
I'm a little busy.

1719
01:54:55,780 --> 01:55:00,050
Does the defendant have
anything to say on his own behalf?

1720
01:55:01,580 --> 01:55:03,970
Yes, Your Honour, I do.

1721
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:09,720
I admit, for the last 20 years
I've been a lying, double- crossing...

1722
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:13,270
...two-faced, backstabbing,
despicable crook.

1723
01:55:13,430 --> 01:55:14,940
But I had no choice.

1724
01:55:16,260 --> 01:55:19,270
I was a Broadway producer.

1725
01:55:20,100 --> 01:55:21,650
A man without a conscience...

1726
01:55:21,890 --> 01:55:24,360
...and with no one
who gave a damn about him.

1727
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:27,360
And that, Your Honour,
is what hurts the most.

1728
01:55:27,810 --> 01:55:31,700
I thought I'd at last
found a loyal partner.

1729
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:34,830
A man I cared about...

1730
01:55:35,110 --> 01:55:37,120
...and who I thought
cared about me.

1731
01:55:37,620 --> 01:55:39,040
What breaks my heart is now...

1732
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:41,590
...when I need him most,
he's deserted me.

1733
01:55:41,750 --> 01:55:44,300
I will probably never see
or hear from him ever again.

1734
01:55:44,460 --> 01:55:45,930
That's not true!

1735
01:55:50,550 --> 01:55:51,970
Order! Order in the court!

1736
01:55:52,510 --> 01:55:55,270
And stop that samba!

1737
01:55:56,470 --> 01:55:59,650
- Who are you?
- I am Leopold Bloom...

1738
01:55:59,810 --> 01:56:02,690
...Max Bialystock's partner.

1739
01:56:02,850 --> 01:56:05,150
And who are you, my dear?

1740
01:56:05,310 --> 01:56:08,910
My name is
Ulla Inga Hansen Benson...

1741
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:14,290
...Yonsen Tallen- Hallen
Svaden Svanson Bloom.

1742
01:56:14,440 --> 01:56:16,040
Bloom?

1743
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:18,830
<i>- You're his wife?
- Ja, Your Honour.</i>

1744
01:56:18,990 --> 01:56:21,790
He wouldn't do it
unless we got married.

1745
01:56:22,950 --> 01:56:24,210
What a schmuck.

1746
01:56:26,370 --> 01:56:28,800
Now, Mr. Bloom,
why in the world would you...

1747
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:31,350
...want to come back here
and give yourself up?

1748
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:34,180
Why? To speak on his behalf.

1749
01:56:35,090 --> 01:56:40,060
We all know that Max Bialystock
is a lying, double- crossing...

1750
01:56:40,220 --> 01:56:44,780
...two-faced, slimy,
manipulative, underhanded...

1751
01:56:44,930 --> 01:56:46,570
Please...

1752
01:56:47,020 --> 01:56:48,490
...don't help me.

1753
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:53,530
Your Honour... Your honour,
if I may address the court.

1754
01:56:54,780 --> 01:57:00,370
The law was created to protect
people from being wronged.

1755
01:57:00,530 --> 01:57:04,380
So whom has
Max Bialystock wronged?

1756
01:57:04,540 --> 01:57:07,630
- Well, not these dear ladies.
- No.

1757
01:57:07,790 --> 01:57:09,930
And not me, not...

1758
01:57:10,380 --> 01:57:12,340
Not me.

1759
01:57:12,710 --> 01:57:14,890
I was this nobody.

1760
01:57:15,050 --> 01:57:18,390
No one ever called me "Leo" before.

1761
01:57:18,550 --> 01:57:21,690
I mean, Your Honour,
I know it isn't a big legal point...

1762
01:57:21,850 --> 01:57:26,070
...but even when I was in kindergarten
everybody always called me "Bloom."

1763
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:30,570
I guess what I'm trying to say
is that even when I was in Rio...

1764
01:57:30,730 --> 01:57:35,490
...and had everything
I'd ever dreamed of...

1765
01:57:38,740 --> 01:57:41,210
...I suddenly realized that...

1766
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:43,500
That this man...

1767
01:57:44,490 --> 01:57:46,210
This man...

1768
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,340
<i>No one ever made me
Feel like someone</i>

1769
01:57:50,790 --> 01:57:52,800
<i>Till him</i>

1770
01:57:55,300 --> 01:57:58,890
<i>Life was really nothing
But a glum one</i>

1771
01:57:59,050 --> 01:58:02,480
<i>Till him</i>

1772
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:07,110
<i>My existence bordered on the tragic</i>

1773
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:10,860
<i>Always timid
Never took a chance</i>

1774
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:13,610
<i>Then I felt his magic</i>

1775
01:58:13,770 --> 01:58:18,410
<i>And my heart began to dance</i>

1776
01:58:19,820 --> 01:58:23,420
<i>I was always frightened
Fraught with worry</i>

1777
01:58:23,620 --> 01:58:25,920
<i>Till him</i>

1778
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:31,630
<i>I was going nowhere in a hurry</i>

1779
01:58:31,790 --> 01:58:36,260
<i>Till him</i>

1780
01:58:36,550 --> 01:58:40,810
<i>He filled up my empty life</i>

1781
01:58:41,130 --> 01:58:46,310
<i>Filled it to the brim</i>

1782
01:58:46,470 --> 01:58:52,650
<i>There could never
Ever be another one</i>

1783
01:58:54,440 --> 01:59:00,160
<i>Like him</i>

1784
01:59:03,660 --> 01:59:05,290
Leo...

1785
01:59:11,710 --> 01:59:13,260
Leo...

1786
01:59:13,420 --> 01:59:15,890
...I never realized.

1787
01:59:17,210 --> 01:59:21,020
- You're a good singer.
- Thank you.

1788
01:59:21,170 --> 01:59:25,520
- No, really, like a professional.
- Well, I sang it for you, Max.

1789
01:59:25,680 --> 01:59:28,730
I sang it because I'm your friend.

1790
01:59:29,930 --> 01:59:31,570
You are?

1791
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:35,530
I've had a lot of relationships...

1792
01:59:35,690 --> 01:59:37,780
...but you couldn't call
any of them "friend."

1793
01:59:37,940 --> 01:59:39,990
But come to think of it...

1794
01:59:40,190 --> 01:59:43,580
...no one ever, ever really knew me.

1795
01:59:43,740 --> 01:59:47,210
<i>Till him</i>

1796
01:59:49,120 --> 01:59:53,010
<i>Everyone was always out
To screw me</i>

1797
01:59:53,160 --> 01:59:57,220
<i>Till him</i>

1798
01:59:58,460 --> 02:00:02,810
<i>Never met a man I ever trusted</i>

1799
02:00:03,050 --> 02:00:07,440
<i>Always dealt with shysters
In the past</i>

1800
02:00:07,640 --> 02:00:10,020
<i>Now I'm well-adjusted</i>

1801
02:00:10,180 --> 02:00:16,360
<i>'Cause I've got a friend at last</i>

1802
02:00:20,190 --> 02:00:22,240
Don't help me.

1803
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:26,750
<i>Always playing singles
Never doubles</i>

1804
02:00:26,910 --> 02:00:29,750
<i>Till him</i>

1805
02:00:44,260 --> 02:00:48,770
<i>Never had a pal
To share my troubles</i>

1806
02:00:48,930 --> 02:00:53,610
<i>Till him</i>

1807
02:00:54,140 --> 02:00:58,780
<i>He filled up my empty life</i>

1808
02:00:59,350 --> 02:01:04,620
<i>- Filled it to the brim
- Filled it to the brim</i>

1809
02:01:04,990 --> 02:01:07,660
<i>There could never ever be</i>

1810
02:01:07,820 --> 02:01:13,590
<i>Another one</i>

1811
02:01:15,950 --> 02:01:25,850
<i>Like him</i>

1812
02:01:31,220 --> 02:01:33,270
Gentlemen, it breaks my heart...

1813
02:01:33,430 --> 02:01:35,860
...to break up
such a beautiful friendship.

1814
02:01:36,020 --> 02:01:37,780
So I won't.

1815
02:01:37,930 --> 02:01:40,650
Five years in the state penitentiary
at Sing Sing.

1816

<i>Gotta sing, sing</i>

02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:49,830
<i>Gotta sing, sing</i>

1818
02:01:49,990 --> 02:01:51,870
<i>Oh, you can lock us up</i>

1819
02:01:52,030 --> 02:01:54,210
<i>Und lose the k ey</i>

02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:08,020
Congratulations.

1827
02:02:09,670 --> 02:02:12,900
You now own 45 percent...

<i>...of Prisoners of Love. Next!</i>

1829
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:19,860
- How much have you sold so far?
- Six hundred percent.

1830
02:02:20,020 --> 02:02:23,610
Is that all? Keep selling.
Keep selling.

1831
02:02:24,190 --> 02:02:28,330
All right, break it up! Break it up!
Quiet! Give me that.

1832
02:02:28,490 --> 02:02:30,540
How many times do
I have to tell you guys?

1833
02:02:30,700 --> 02:02:33,460
No knife fights in rehearsal.

1834
02:02:36,030 --> 02:02:38,130
Hi. What are you in for,
lack of rhythm?

1835
02:02:38,290 --> 02:02:40,710
Get in line.
Everybody get in line, right away!

good news!

This just came from the governor.

"Gentlemen, you are hereby
granted a full pardon...

1853

<i>Next stop, Prisoners of Love
on Broadway!</i>

1857
02:03:42,930 --> 02:03:47,450
- Broadway!
- Adolf, you must tell the other birds.

1858
02:03:47,610 --> 02:03:53,410
<i>But hearts in love
Are always free</i>

1859

<i>And lose the k ey</i>

1867

<i>But hearts in love

<i>So when we take your money
Never fear</i>

1883

<i>We'll knock Broadway
Right on its ear</i>

1884
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:33,890
<i>The cast is great
The script is swell</i>

1885
02:05:34,050 --> 02:05:35,770
<i>But this we're telling you, sirs</i>

1886
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:37,600
<i>It's just no go
You've got no show</i>

1887
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:40,980
<i>Without the producers</i>

1888

<i>The producers
Leo and Max</i>

<i>The overture is over</i>

1892
02:07:49,180 --> 02:07:51,440
<i>The curtain starts to rise</i>

1893
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:53,740
<i>You're suddenly in clover</i>

1894
02:07:53,890 --> 02:07:56,240
<i>You can't believe your eyes</i>

1895
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:58,530
<i>You're sitting on the aisle</i>

1896
02:07:58,690 --> 02:08:00,950
<i>You break into a smile</i>

1897
02:08:01,110 --> 02:08:03,080
<i>Why this magic feeling?</i>

1898
02:08:03,240 --> 02:08:07,460
<i>And then you realize</i>

1899
02:08:07,620 --> 02:08:10,710
<i>That there is</i>

1900
02:08:10,870 --> 02:08:15,050
<i>Nothing like a show on Broadway</i>

1901
02:08:15,210 --> 02:08:19,260
<i>Nothing like a Broadway show</i>

1902
02:08:19,420 --> 02:08:23,020
<i>Hearts will skip a beat on Broadway</i>

1903
02:08:23,170 --> 02:08:25,730
<i>If you're feeling blue
I'm telling you</i>

1904
02:08:25,880 --> 02:08:27,810
<i>That's the place to go</i>

1905
02:08:27,970 --> 02:08:30,060
<i>Movies drag
Their endings sag</i>

1906
02:08:30,220 --> 02:08:31,900
<i>TV's just a bore</i>

1907
02:08:32,060 --> 02:08:34,070
<i>So hit the street
And move your feet</i>

1908
02:08:34,230 --> 02:08:35,780
<i>To the place we all adore</i>

1909
02:08:35,940 --> 02:08:40,530
<i>Because there's nothing
Like a show on Broadway</i>

1910
02:08:40,690 --> 02:08:44,660
<i>There's nothing
Like a Broadway show</i>

1911
02:08:44,820 --> 02:08:46,580
<i>It's often been said
The theatre is dead</i>

1912
02:08:46,740 --> 02:08:48,460
<i>The critics repeat it en masse</i>

1913
02:08:48,620 --> 02:08:50,460
<i>But the theatre's alive
It's gonna survive</i>

1914
02:08:50,620 --> 02:08:52,250
<i>Although it's a pain in the ass</i>

1915
02:08:52,410 --> 02:08:54,260
<i>You waited forever
And finally got tick ets</i>

1916
02:08:54,410 --> 02:08:56,300
<i>To get to your seat
You gotta cross pick ets</i>

1917
02:08:56,460 --> 02:08:58,300
<i>The guy to your right
Is frightfully tight</i>

1918
02:08:58,460 --> 02:09:00,760
<i>The guy to your left
Appears to have rick ets</i>

1919
02:09:00,920 --> 02:09:02,850
<i>The music's yuck
The lyrics suck</i>

1920
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:04,890
<i>The casting is all wrong</i>

1921
02:09:05,050 --> 02:09:06,930
<i>And when you reach the bathroom</i>

1922
02:09:07,090 --> 02:09:08,440
<i>The line is five miles long</i>

1923
02:09:08,590 --> 02:09:12,900
<i>But still there's nothing
Like a show on Broadway</i>

1924
02:09:13,060 --> 02:09:16,990
<i>There's nothing
Like a Broadway show</i>

1925
02:09:17,140 --> 02:09:18,900
<i>You swear you'll never go again</i>

1926
02:09:19,060 --> 02:09:20,950
<i>It's simply not worthwhile</i>

1927
02:09:21,110 --> 02:09:23,200
<i>You make that vow
And then somehow</i>

1928
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:27,910
<i>- You're back there on the aisle
- You're back there on the aisle</i>

1929
02:09:28,070 --> 02:09:31,330
<i>That's why there's</i>

1930
02:09:31,490 --> 02:09:35,380
<i>Nothing like a show
On Broadway</i>

1931
02:09:35,540 --> 02:09:38,050
<i>There's nothing
Like a Broadway show</i>

1932
02:09:38,210 --> 02:09:39,630
<i>Till you're in movies</i>

1933
02:09:39,790 --> 02:09:44,050
<i>There's nothing
Like a Broadway show</i>

1934
02:09:44,210 --> 02:09:48,390
<i>And though it is expensive
At a hundred bucks a throw</i>

1935
02:09:48,550 --> 02:09:51,230
<i>There's nothing</i>

1936
02:09:51,390 --> 02:09:57,940
<i>Like a Broadway show!</i>

1937
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:13,310
