1
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,210
What are you doing?
We don't stop here.

2
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,599
Get out of the car.

3
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,780
The boys found this...

4
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,699
on the floor, in back of the Caddy.

5
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,327
Yeah.
You showed me.

6
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,958
- Could be unrelated.
- Could be.

7
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,254
Any of those dead kids
wearing pearl earrings?

8
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,965
No.

9
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:54,385
Could be someone's
missing, maybe.

10
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,013
That's what I'm thinking.

11
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:38,053
Just one more bag after that.

12
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,245
I just wanted to come here.

13
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,330
To Winkie's?

14
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,625
This Winkie's.

15
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:36,338
Okay. Why this Winkie's?

16
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,802
It's kind of embarrassing.

17
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,515
Go ahead.

18
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,102
I had a dream about this place.

19
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,770
Oh, boy.

20
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,856
See what I mean?

21
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,109
Okay.

22
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,570
So you had a dream about this place.

23
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,322
Tell me.

24
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,580
Well –

25
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,790
it's the second one I've had.

26
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,834
But they're both the same.

27
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,796
They start out that I'm in here...

28
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:21,091
but it's not day or night.

29
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:25,387
I-It's kind of half night, you know?

30
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,223
But it looks just like this.

31
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,225
Except for the light.

32
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,229
And I'm scared like I can't tell ya.

33
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:38,942
Of all people...

34
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,944
you're standing right over there...

35
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,701
by that counter.

36
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:53,165
You're in both dreams, and you're scared.

37
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,754
I get even more frightened
when I see how afraid you are, and...

38
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,760
then I realize what it is.

39
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,265
There's a man...

40
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,144
in back of this place.

41
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:18,524
He's the one who's doing it.

42
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,694
I can see him through the wall.

43
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,531
I can see his face.

44
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:34,122
I hope that I never see that face...

45
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,750
ever outside of a dream.

46
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,054
That's it.

47
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,847
So...

48
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,809
you came to see if he's out there.

49
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,398
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.

50
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,486
Right, then.

51
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:24,840
Oh –

52
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,744
It was around here.

53
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:06,608
Dan! Dan, you all right? Dan!

54
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:10,070
Dan!

55
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,637
Hello?

56
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:40,308
The girl is still missing.

57
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,914
Talk to me.

58
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,916
The same.

59
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,954
Oh!

60
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,040
I can't believe it.

61
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,824
Well, it's time to say good-bye, Betty.

62
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,826
It's been so nice traveling with you.

63
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,995
Thank you, Irene.
I was so excited and nervous.

64
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,997
It was sure great to have you to talk to.

65
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,500
Remember, I'll be watching
for you on the big screen.

66
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:32,170
Okay, Irene. Won't that be the day?

67
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:35,423
Good luck, Betty dear.

68
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,218
Take care of yourself.
And be careful.

69
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:42,013
- I will. Thanks again.
- Okay, dear.

70
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:45,100
Betty, it was so nice meeting you.
All the luck in the world.

71
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,935
Thank you.

72
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,104
- Bye.
- Bye.

73
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,696
My bags!

74
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,281
Where to?

75
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,617
1612 Havenhurst.

76
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,372
Got it.

77
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,368
Ten bucks says you're Betty.

78
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,120
Yes, I am, Mrs. Lenoix.

79
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,122
It is Mrs. Lenoix, isn't it?

80
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,458
Oh, in all my living glory, baby.

81
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,502
Pleased to meet you.

82
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,463
Oh, just call me Coco.
Everybody else does.

83
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:42,008
- Wait there, and I'll go get the key.
- Okay, Coco.

84
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:49,766
Wilkins! Wilkins!

85
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,770
If that damn dog
craps in the courtyard one more time...

86
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:57,273
I'm just gonna
bake his little butt for breakfast!

87
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:59,693
- You don't have any pets, do you?
- Oh, no, I don't.

88
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:03,196
Well, they're allowed. I just don't
like them here for obvious reasons.

89
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,824
You know, there was a man
that lived here once...

90
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,576
that had a prizefighting kangaroo.

91
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,954
Well, you just wouldn't believe...

92
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,957
what that kangaroo did to this courtyard.

93
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:18,128
Let's go see your aunt's apartment.
It's a good one.

94
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,338
I can hardly wait.

95
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,014
It's unbelievable!

96
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:33,059
- I told ya.
- Oh, wow!

97
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:37,272
Well, you and your aunt probably have
an understanding, so here's the key.

98
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,066
- And if you need anything, just give a holler.
- Okay.

99
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:43,153
You know, everybody in this building
is pretty much okay with me...

100
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,738
or they wouldn't be here.

101
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,281
Oh.

102
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,659
If you like, later on
I'll introduce you around.

103
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:52,454
Well, no hard feelings if you don't.

104
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:22,043
Oh, my. I-I'm sorry. My Aunt Ruth didn't
tell me someone was gonna be here.

105
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:25,463
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

106
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:27,757
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty.

107
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:30,552
I-I'm sure she told you I was coming.

108
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,513
There was an accident.

109
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,682
I came here.

110
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:38,309
I understand. I saw the dress.

111
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:42,188
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

112
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:44,232
What happened?

113
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,069
A car –

114
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,238
A car accident.

115
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,240
Oh.

116
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,325
Are you okay?

117
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,038
I think so.

118
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:01,583
I was just...

119
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,585
taking a shower.

120
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,587
Oh, my God. I'm – I'm sorry.

121
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,923
I'll let you get back to that.
I'm gonna get unpacked.

122
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,555
What's your name?

123
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:23,521
I'm – I'm sorry. I'll get out of here,
and we can talk later.

124
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:03,811
My name's... Rita.

125
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,064
Hi.

126
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,107
Do you work with my aunt?

127
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:12,278
- No, I –
- I-I'm sorry.

128
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:15,949
It's – It's none of my business. I –

129
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,621
She has pretty red hair.

130
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:25,750
She's letting me stay here while she's working
on a movie that's being made in Canada.

131
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,336
But... I guess you already know that.

132
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,090
I couldn't afford a place
like this in a million years.

133
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:36,219
Unless, of course, I'm discovered
and become a movie star.

134
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:39,514
Of course, I'd rather be known
as a great actress than a movie star.

135
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,933
But, you know, sometimes
people end up being both.

136
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:46,521
So that is, I guess you'd say,
sort of why I came here.

137
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:53,861
I'm sorry. I'm just so excited to be here.

138
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,447
I mean, I just came here
from Deep River, Ontario...

139
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:58,616
and now I'm in this...

140
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:01,244
dream place.

141
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,538
Well, you can imagine how I feel.

142
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,044
Oh.

143
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,797
What – Sit down.

144
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,554
Wh-Where were you hurt?

145
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,142
- Oh, we should call a doctor.
- No.

146
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,811
- But this could be serious.
- No, I –

147
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,813
I need to sleep.

148
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,107
If you have a concussion,
you shouldn't sleep.

149
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,901
It will be okay if I sleep.

150
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:37,405
I just need to lie down here and sleep.

151
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:38,800
You see, Adam,
there are some suggestions...

152
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,010
that are to be brought forward.

153
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:44,180
I know you said you would
entertain suggestions.

154
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:47,475
And that's all anybody here
is asking you to do.

155
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,686
What are you talking about?

156
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:53,314
An open mind.

157
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:56,609
You're in the process
of recasting your lead actress...

158
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,653
and I'm –

159
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:02,865
We're asking you to keep an open mind.

160
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,420
What was it last time?

161
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:20,842
Okay. Let's try the next one.

162
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:23,386
He's not gonna like it.

163
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,681
We'll see.

164
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:34,272
Ah, the Castigliane brothers.

165
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:36,274
Let me introduce you around.

166
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:41,154
Oh, please, uh, just take a seat.

167
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:43,448
This is Mr. Darby, whom you know...

168
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:47,118
and this is the director, Adam Kesher...

169
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,413
and his, uh, manager, Robert Smith.

170
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:25,490
Oh, yeah.

171
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,492
- She's very pretty.
- Mm-hmm.

172
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:32,538
- Mmm. Mmm.
- May I offer you gentlemen... anything?

173
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:37,335
- Espresso.
- Nothin'.

174
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,795
Uh, what's the photo for?

175
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,465
One espresso.

176
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,800
No, that's it.

177
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:47,094
I think you're going to enjoy
your espresso this time.

178
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:50,848
I've done quite a bit of research,
knowing how hard you are to please.

179
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:53,518
This one comes highly recommended.

180
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,686
What's the photo for?

181
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,897
It's a recommendation.

182
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,776
A recommendation to you, Adam.

183
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:06,405
- It's not a recommendation.
- This is the girl.

184
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:10,952
What girl? For what?
What is this, Ray?

185
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:14,622
Uh, we'd be happy to put her
on the list for considerations.

186
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,791
Uh, you'd be pleased to know...

187
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,127
that there's quite a bit
of interest in this role.

188
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,464
Interest? No, no.

189
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,466
There's six of the top actresses
that want this thing.

190
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,927
This is the girl.

191
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:31,055
- Ryan, take care of this.
- Hold on. Hold on, Adam.

192
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,057
Hold on?

193
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,601
There's no way. There's no way!

194
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:53,619
Napkin.

195
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:57,081
- Pardon?
- Napkin.

196
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,750
Of course.

197
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,794
Excuse me.

198
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,438
Is that all, sir?

199
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:20,456
- Shit.
- I'm sorry.

200
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:23,751
-That was a highly recommended –
-That is considered one of
the finest espressos in the world.

201
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,505
What is going on here?
There is no way that girl is in my movie!

202
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:32,718
This is the girl.

203
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:36,263
Hey, that girl is not in my film!

204
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:41,519
It's no longer your film.

205
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,442
This is the girl.

206
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,400
Castigliane brothers
get out of that limo?

207
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,320
- You mean two guys in dark suits?
- Yeah.

208
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,990
- Yeah.
- Leave that door open.

209
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,418
Castigliane brothers?

210
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:51,630
- Beat it, pal.
- Okay.

211
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:36,717
Good afternoon, Mr. Roque.

212
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:43,140
Her name is Camilla Rhodes.

213
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:46,310
The director doesn't want her.

214
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:52,191
Do you want him replaced?

215
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:56,570
I know they said –

216
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:01,116
Then?

217
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,743
Then...

218
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,746
that means we should–

219
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,544
Yes?

220
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,338
shut everything down.

221
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,258
Is that something that –

222
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,427
You want us...

223
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,429
to shut everything down?

224
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,688
Then we'll shut everything down.

225
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,552
Oh, man.

226
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,637
That's unheard of.

227
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:06,849
An accident like that –
who could have foreseen that, man?

228
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:11,186
- Jeez!
- It's unreal, right?

229
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,939
Hell, yeah.

230
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:16,108
Unbelievable, man.

231
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,279
Whoo.

232
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,159
So, bro. God, you look good.

233
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,161
What have you been doing?

234
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,581
Well, you know, just doin'
some stuff for this guy.

235
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,750
- Yeah? Are you making ends meet?
- Yeah.

236
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,920
Hardly.

237
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:39,089
I know, man.

238
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,133
Look at my digs.

239
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,928
Times are tough, bro.

240
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,682
Hey, man, it's not that bad.

241
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,936
Gee, I hope you're not
gonna get into any trouble.

242
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,021
Oh, that was just a thing, man.

243
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,023
But that story,
that made you laugh, right?

244
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,526
- That was a funny story, man.
- Fucking car accident.

245
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:06,283
Hey, so that's, uh – That's it, huh?

246
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:08,702
That's Ed's famous black book.

247
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:15,709
The history of the world...
in phone numbers.

248
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,568
Um –

249
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,283
Aw, man.

250
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:02,881
Something bit me bad!

251
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,805
Shh.

252
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,057
Shh! Shh!

253
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,688
Ow!

254
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,405
No!

255
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:34,955
No! No!

256
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,250
God!

257
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,918
God!

258
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:43,630
No!

259
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,471
Shh!

260
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:54,767
Hey, man! Hey!

261
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:58,562
She's hurt real bad! Could you come here
and call on the phone? I need you!

262
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,065
She's hurt real bad! I'm serious!

263
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,150
You gotta come in here
and call the hospital!

264
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,278
Come on, man! I'm serious about this!

265
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,906
I can't do everything by myself, man!

266
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,742
No! Let go!

267
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:15,496
No! No!

268
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,418
Oh! No!

269
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:24,004
No! No! No!

270
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,177
Hey, man.

271
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,045
Um –

272
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,596
Aw, man.

273
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:33,323
Okay, Aunt Ruth, I'll try.

274
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:38,620
I'm gonna study those lines
until I know 'em inside out.

275
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:41,832
Yep, either right here on
this fabulous leather couch...

276
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,834
or I'll take them with a coffee
into the courtyard...

277
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,670
like a regular movie star.

278
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,256
Oh, I got a real shock
to find your friend Rita here.

279
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,551
She was in the shower,
and I opened the door.

280
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,219
Rita.

281
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,930
What do you mean?

282
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:01,185
Well, she was in an accident.

283
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,979
Rita, your friend.

284
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:07,941
No, Coco unlocked the door.

285
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:10,944
No, she didn't see her.

286
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,698
She's sleeping.

287
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:20,078
I'm sure there's some explanation for this.
I don't think we have to do that.

288
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:26,543
Please don't worry.
Aunt Ruth, we don't need the police.

289
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:41,308
You're awake.

290
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:47,773
I think I misunderstood.

291
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:51,401
I thought you knew my aunt,
and that's why you were here.

292
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:55,155
I just talked to my aunt on the phone,
and she wants me to call the police.

293
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:03,580
Rita?

294
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,336
I'm sorry. I –

295
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,338
What is it, Rita?

296
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,344
I thought when I woke up –

297
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,930
I thought sleep would do it.

298
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,932
What's wrong?

299
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:27,104
I don't know who I am.

300
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,273
What do you mean? You're Rita.

301
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:33,610
No, I'm not. I don't know what my name is.

302
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:36,655
I don't know who I am.

303
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:48,292
This is your purse.

304
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:50,877
Your name must be in your purse.

305
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,132
You want to know, don't you?

306
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:58,385
- Yes, but –
- Open it.

307
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:37,317
- So you don't want anything?
- Not here. No, thanks.

308
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:41,947
- A drink or something?
- No. Thanks, though.

309
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:44,741
I'll take a cigarette, if you have one.

310
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,247
Yeah, just reach inside
my shirt pocket there.

311
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,379
Any new girls on the street lately?

312
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:01,758
No.

313
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:03,802
I haven't seen any.

314
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,431
A brunette?

315
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:09,474
Maybe a little beat-up?

316
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,519
No.

317
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:18,608
You keep your eyes open
for me, won't you, baby?

318
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:21,945
- Sure.
- Yeah, you bet you will.

319
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:26,867
That money –

320
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,662
you don't know where it came from?

321
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,539
Uh-uh.

322
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:38,920
When you think of them –
the money and the key –

323
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:43,842
does it make you remember anything?

324
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,263
There's something –

325
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:52,476
something... there, I –

326
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,448
What did you say?

327
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,658
They fired everyone.

328
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,994
Who fired everyone?

329
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:15,332
Ray did – Wait!
I-I'm talking on the phone.

330
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:18,502
And then they closed the set.
Everybody's gone.

331
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:21,630
You'd better get down here, Adam.

332
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:23,298
No.

333
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:26,134
You've gotta talk to Ray.
You've gotta fix this.

334
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:29,346
- I'm going home.
- Home?

335
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,389
Meet me at the office.
We've gotta do something.

336
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:33,391
You've gotta do something, Adam.

337
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:35,519
I'm going home, Cynthia.

338
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:37,646
Adam, listen to me. This isn't like you.

339
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:39,648
Please come to the office.

340
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:42,025
- There's gotta be something we can do.
- I'm going home.

341
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,455
I wonder where you were going.

342
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,462
Mulholland Drive.

343
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:09,302
Mulholland Drive?

344
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,723
That's where I was going –

345
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:16,935
Mulholland Drive.

346
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:20,730
Maybe that's where the accident was.

347
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:24,859
There must be a police report.
We could call.

348
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:26,403
No.

349
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:30,907
We could call anonymously from a pay phone
just to see if there was an accident.

350
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:33,451
Come on.
It'll be just like in the movies.

351
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:36,121
We'll pretend to be someone else.

352
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:39,833
I wanna walk around anyway.

353
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:43,295
I'm in Hollywood,
and I haven't even seen any of it.

354
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:46,339
Come on, Rita. Do you feel up to it?

355
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,557
Okay.

356
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,892
But... just –

357
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:02,355
just to see.

358
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,610
Just to see if there was an accident...

359
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:09,195
on Mulholland Drive.

360
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:53,239
Lorraine?

361
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:56,743
Lorraine, you home?

362
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,706
Lorraine?

363
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:24,020
Now you've done it.

364
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:29,609
Just forget you ever saw it.
It's better that way.

365
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:35,448
What the hell are you even doing here?

366
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,962
What are you doing?

367
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,300
That's my jewelry!

368
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:15,071
That bastard! You bastard!

369
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:17,323
He's probably upset, Lorraine.

370
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:24,998
What are you doing?

371
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:30,628
Stop it! Stop it!

372
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:32,922
Adam, stop it!

373
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,259
Stop it! Stop it!

374
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:40,764
Adam! Cut – Cut it out! Ow!

375
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:44,142
You're hurting me! Gene!

376
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:45,977
You're hurting me!

377
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:52,776
That ain't no way to treat your wife, buddy.
I don't care what she's done.

378
00:51:54,195 --> 00:51:55,653
Throw him out!

379
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,615
Throw him out!

380
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:00,617
Damn you, Adam!

381
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:02,994
Throw him out!

382
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,795
Get out!

383
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,710
Let's hide it.

384
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,924
There's one.

385
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:58,735
Hollywood Police Department.

386
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:01,821
I'm inquiring about an accident that happened
last night on Mulholland Drive.

387
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:04,324
Hold, please. I'll connect you to Traffic.

388
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:09,829
- Sergeant Baxter.
- Hi. I'm inquiring –

389
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:15,168
Well, I heard a sound last night that
sounded sort of like a car crash...

390
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:19,255
and, well, I want to know if there was
an accident on Mulholland Drive.

391
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:21,257
Yes, there was.

392
00:54:21,342 --> 00:54:24,427
- Can you tell me what happened?
- No, I can't.

393
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:27,305
- Was anyone hurt?
- May I have your name, please?

394
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,439
There was an accident.

395
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:40,693
He wouldn't tell me anything else,
but that was your accident. I just know it was.

396
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:44,656
Maybe there's something
about it in the papers.

397
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,991
I'll buy you a cup of coffee
and we can see.

398
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:54,499
Maybe it happened so late,
it's not in today's paper.

399
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:56,542
There's nothing?

400
00:54:58,087 --> 00:55:00,880
Not that I can see.

401
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:03,841
That's okay.

402
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,389
Thanks...

403
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:12,725
Diane.

404
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:20,984
Will that be all?
Would you like your check?

405
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:22,902
Rita, you want something?

406
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:28,825
No, just – just the coffee.

407
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:31,369
- We'll take our check.
- Okay.

408
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:39,961
- What is it, Rita?
- Shh.

409
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:50,013
I remember something.

410
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:52,348
I remember something!

411
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:58,688
- What is it?
- Diane Selwyn.

412
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:01,274
Maybe that's my name!

413
00:56:02,735 --> 00:56:04,610
Selwyn. Selwyn.

414
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:10,658
"D. Selwyn." It's the only one.

415
00:56:10,743 --> 00:56:12,702
I'm gonna call.

416
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,253
It's strange to be calling yourself.

417
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:25,006
Maybe it's not me.

418
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:36,684
Hello, it's me. Leave a message.

419
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:41,731
That's not my voice.

420
00:56:42,775 --> 00:56:44,734
But I know her.

421
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:50,156
Maybe that isn't Diane Selwyn's voice.

422
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,450
Maybe that's your roommate.

423
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,911
Or if it is Diane Selwyn...

424
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:58,206
she could tell you who you are.

425
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:00,666
Maybe.

426
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:02,835
Maybe. Maybe.

Adam Kesher?

442
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,437
Yeah, what is it, Cookie?

443
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:49,609
I'm sorry, Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be
some problem with your credit cards.

444
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:52,445
What? I-I pay you cash, Cookie.

445
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:58,618
Mira, ese.
Two guys from your bank came by.

446
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:00,953
My bank?

447
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:04,749
- How-How'd they know I was here?
- I don't know.

448
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:07,710
What'd they say?

449
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:12,215
I'm afraid they said to tell you that
you're maxed out at your bank...

450
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:15,635
and that your line of credit
has been canceled.

451
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:20,890
That's unbelievable. Huh.

452
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:23,184
Well, look, uh...

453
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:27,271
I , uh – I don't know what's going on.

454
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:30,983
That is so much baloney.

455
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:32,610
Uh –

456
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,904
But I got enough cash for you, Cookie.

457
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:39,283
Oh, I know. I know. Don't worry.

458
00:59:39,368 --> 00:59:42,161
But, ese, I'm sorry.

459
00:59:42,246 --> 00:59:44,413
It was my duty to inform you.

460
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:48,084
Oye, carnal.

461
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:52,338
Whoever you're hiding from,
they know where you are.

462
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:55,841
Right.

463
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:58,552
I'm sorry.

464
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:23,786
Hello?

465
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,788
Someone maybe shut off my money.

466
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:27,790
I know. Where are you, Adam?

467
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:30,126
I'm sorry.
What do you mean, you know?

468
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:34,505
Somebody called. When they couldn't get you,
they told me you were as good as broke.

469
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,799
I didn't believe them,
so I made a few calls.

470
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:39,218
- And?
- You're broke.

471
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:40,845
Yeah, but I'm not broke!

472
01:00:40,929 --> 01:00:43,723
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?

473
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,893
I'm at Cookie's, downtown.

474
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:51,689
Do you know somebody
called the Cowboy?

475
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,984
- The Cowboy?
- Yeah.

476
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,360
The Cowboy.

477
01:00:56,445 --> 01:00:59,822
This guy, the Cowboy,
wants to see you.

478
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,742
Jason said he thought it'd be a good idea.

479
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:07,288
Oh, Jason thought it'd be a good idea
for me to go see the Cowboy.

480
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:10,666
Well, should I wear my 10-gallon hat
and my six-shooters?

481
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:14,337
Listen, something tells me that this guy
is connected to what's happening.

482
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:19,342
Adam, I think you should do it,
and I think you should do it right away.

483
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:21,344
What's going on, Cynthia?

484
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:23,804
It's been a very strange day.

485
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,600
And getting stranger.

486
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:33,272
So, where do I meet this Cowboy?
Do I have to ride out to the range?

487
01:01:34,149 --> 01:01:36,359
Sort of, funny boy.

488
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:38,444
If I tell him the meeting's on...

489
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:41,364
you'll have to go to the top
of Beachwood Canyon...

490
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:45,409
and there's a corral up there
where he'll be.

491
01:01:45,494 --> 01:01:48,079
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

492
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:50,539
Will you meet with him?

493
01:01:50,624 --> 01:01:53,000
Yeah. Sure.

494
01:01:53,085 --> 01:01:56,212
No, i-it's been that kind of a day.
When?

495
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:58,381
Um, I'll call him right away...

496
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:01,133
and then I'll call you back.

497
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:05,304
You know, you – you could stay
at my place if you – if you wanted.

498
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:08,557
Uh, Cynthia, no.
I don't think that would be a good idea.

499
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:10,893
I was just offering a place to stay.

500
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:14,146
Yes, and I appreciate the offer, Cynthia.
I'll find a place.

501
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:17,608
Just go and give that Cowboy a yodel
and get on back to me.

502
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:20,611
Okay. But you don't know
what you're missing.

503
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:24,740
Uh, just get along, little doggie,
and call me back.

504
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:39,088
It's right about here – Sierra Bonita.

505
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,090
Not too far away.

506
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:44,176
What's wrong with that?

507
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,221
I'm not sure about this.

508
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:51,308
I know you're afraid of something.

509
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:54,854
We'll be careful, I promise.

510
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:59,984
Tomorrow, we'll go over there...

511
01:03:00,068 --> 01:03:02,153
and we'll find out.

512
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:18,377
It'll be okay.

513
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:21,797
It's probably Coco.

514
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,053
Yes? May I help you?

515
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:30,347
Someone is in trouble.

516
01:03:32,184 --> 01:03:34,977
Who are you?

517
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,897
What are you doing in Ruth's apartment?

518
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:40,065
She's letting me stay here.

519
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:42,735
I'm her niece. My name's Betty.

520
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,737
No, it's not.

521
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:47,198
That's not what she said.

522
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:51,994
Someone is in trouble!
Something bad is happening!

523
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:55,539
Well, I-I'm sorry,
but I don't know who you are, and –

524
01:03:55,624 --> 01:03:58,667
Louise? What are you doing, Louise?

525
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:00,836
I – Oh, Coco.

526
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:04,465
I've been trying to get a hold of you
since 3:00 this afternoon.

527
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:08,052
That one is in my room,
and she won't leave.

528
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:11,180
I want you to get her out.
I want you to get her out now!

529
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:14,600
Uh, this is Louise Bonner.
I'm sure she meant well.

530
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:18,771
Louise, this is Betty.
This is Ruth's niece.

531
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,899
In fact, fortunately I was just on my way
over here to see Betty.

532
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:24,693
Betty's a young actress,
and I was just delivering...

533
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:28,113
some faxed pages of a scene
for a big audition tomorrow.

534
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:30,950
- Well, here they are, honey.
- Oh, thank you.

535
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:33,619
Come along now, Louise.
I'll take you home.

536
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,371
I'm sorry.
It happens sometimes.

537
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:36,705
- No.
- Come on.

538
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:39,208
No. She said it was someone else
who was in trouble.

539
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,126
Stop it, Louise. I'm taking you home.

540
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:44,421
Come on. I-I –

541
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:46,465
- Good night, Betty.
- Good night.

542
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:49,301
Good night.

543
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:01,480
Whoa.

544
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:29,508
Cowboy.

545
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:41,080
- Howdy.
- Howdy to you.

546
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,917
Beautiful evenin'.

547
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:47,878
Yeah.

548
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:51,965
Sure wanna thank you for comin'
all the way up here to see me...

549
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:55,219
from that nice hotel downtown.

550
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:59,848
No problem. What's on your mind?

551
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:04,395
Well, now, here's a man
who wants to get right down to it.

552
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:07,272
Kinda anxious to get to it, are ya?

553
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:08,941
Whatever.

554
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:12,361
A man's attitude –

555
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:16,240
A man's attitude goes some ways...

556
01:07:16,324 --> 01:07:19,159
to the way his life will be.

557
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:21,704
Is that something you might agree with?

558
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:23,539
Sure.

559
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:25,541
Now, did you answer...

560
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:28,252
because that's what you thought
I wanted to hear...

561
01:07:28,336 --> 01:07:30,546
or did you think about what I said...

562
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:34,591
and answer 'cause
you truly believe that to be right?

563
01:07:35,844 --> 01:07:39,888
I agree with what you said. Truly.

564
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:43,600
What'd I say?

565
01:07:46,438 --> 01:07:50,149
That a man's attitude determines,
to a large extent, how his life will be.

566
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:54,403
So since you agree...

567
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:59,450
you must be a person
who does not care about the good life.

568
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:01,744
How's that?

569
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:07,374
Well, stop for a little second
and think about it.

570
01:08:07,459 --> 01:08:09,668
Can you do that for me?

571
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:15,132
Okay. I'm thinkin'.

572
01:08:18,553 --> 01:08:20,596
No, you're not thinkin'.

573
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,682
You're too busy
bein' a smart aleck to be thinkin'.

574
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:28,854
Now, I want you to think
and stop bein' a smart aleck.

575
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,856
Can you try that for me?

576
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:35,861
Look, where's this going?
What do you want me to do?

577
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:39,239
There's sometimes a buggy.

578
01:08:39,324 --> 01:08:41,700
How many drivers does a buggy have?

579
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:43,869
One.

580
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:47,915
So let's just say
I'm drivin' this buggy...

581
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:52,127
and if you fix your attitude,
you can ride along with me.

582
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:54,463
Okay.

583
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:57,466
I want you to go back to work tomorrow.

584
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:01,011
You were recasting
the lead actress anyway.

585
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:05,265
Audition many girls for the part.

586
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:10,229
When you see the girl that was shown
to you earlier today, you will say...

587
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:13,649
"This is the girl."

588
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:16,193
The rest of the cast can stay.

589
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,904
That's up to you.

590
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:21,865
But that lead girl is not up to you.

591
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:26,787
Now, you will see me one more time...

592
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:29,414
if you do good.

593
01:09:29,499 --> 01:09:32,543
You'll see me two more times...

594
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:35,003
if you do bad.

595
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:37,047
Good night.

596
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:03,615
You're still here?

597
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:06,535
I came back. I thought
that's what you wanted.

598
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,537
Nobody wants you here.

599
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:11,248
Really?

600
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:14,001
My parents are right upstairs.
They think you've left.

601
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:18,213
- So? Surprise.
- I can call them. I can call my dad.

602
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:20,465
But you won't.

603
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:23,886
If you're trying to blackmail me,
it's not gonna work.

604
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:25,929
You're playing a dangerous game here.

605
01:10:26,014 --> 01:10:28,390
You know what I want.
It's not that difficult.

606
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:31,977
Get out! Get out before I call my dad!

607
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:35,230
He trusts you. You're his best friend.

608
01:10:35,315 --> 01:10:37,733
This will be the end of everything.

609
01:10:37,817 --> 01:10:41,069
What about you?
What will your dad think about you?

610
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:45,490
Stop! Just stop it!
That's what you said from the beginning!

611
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:48,911
Now, if I tell what happened,
they'll arrest you and put you in jail.

612
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:51,121
So, get out of here before –

613
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:54,082
B-Before what?

614
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:58,086
Before... I kill you.

615
01:10:58,171 --> 01:11:00,505
Then they'd put you in jail.

616
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:07,596
Then I cry, cry, cry,
and then I say with big emotion...

617
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,432
"I hate you! I hate us both!"

618
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:17,439
- Such a lame scene.
- But you are really good.

619
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,984
Thank you, darling.

620
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,126
Hi there. Who are you?

621
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:41,463
Uh –

622
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:43,465
Betty?

623
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:52,891
Uh, Betty,
can I see you outside for a minute?

624
01:12:07,407 --> 01:12:10,867
- What is it, Coco?
- Your aunt called.

625
01:12:12,412 --> 01:12:13,996
I was afraid of that.

626
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,456
She wants to know
who's staying in her apartment.

627
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:20,919
It's just for a night or two,
until she finds her own place.

628
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:23,422
I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth,
but the connection was bad...

629
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:26,508
and her plane was leaving,
and she got it all mixed up.

630
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:28,760
I kept telling her that
it was my friend Rita...

631
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:31,263
and she kept saying
she didn't know any Ritas.

632
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:34,683
- Look at me straight, sweetie.
- Coco.

633
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,852
She's very nice.

634
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:38,854
Honey, you're a good kid.

635
01:12:38,938 --> 01:12:42,065
But what you're telling me
is a load of horse puckey...

636
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:44,985
even though it comes from a good place.

637
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:47,612
Now, I'm gonna trust you
to sort this thing out.

638
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:49,614
Thank you.

639
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:52,034
Don't make me out to be a sucker.

640
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:54,411
Louise Bonner said
there's trouble in there.

641
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:56,413
Remember last night?

642
01:12:56,497 --> 01:13:00,042
Well, sometimes she's wrong.

643
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:03,920
But if there is trouble, get rid of it.

644
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:16,224
Is everything all right?

645
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:18,226
Is it bad for you that I'm here?

646
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:21,563
No, no. Everything is A-okay.

647
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,857
Now, I've gotta fix that sandwich.

648
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:26,860
And my audition is in one hour!

649
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:49,633
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours.

650
01:13:49,717 --> 01:13:52,803
- And don't drink all the Coke.
- Good luck!

651
01:13:52,887 --> 01:13:56,139
Now, when I get back I'll keep
the cab waiting, so be ready to go.

652
01:13:56,224 --> 01:13:58,183
- Okay.
- Okay?

653
01:14:26,337 --> 01:14:28,213
Voilà.

654
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:30,715
Betty Elms...

655
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,386
I would like you to meet
Jack Tuptman, my assistant...

656
01:14:35,346 --> 01:14:37,222
Woody Katz...

657
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:39,808
who we have cast in the part of Chuck
and will do the scene with you...

658
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:43,353
Bob Brooker, our director...

659
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:46,148
and Julie Chadwick.

660
01:14:46,232 --> 01:14:48,733
Now, our surprise guest...

661
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:50,986
Linney James.

662
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:53,488
Alas, we can't afford her
to cast our show...

663
01:14:53,573 --> 01:14:56,199
but, well, as casting agents go...

664
01:14:56,284 --> 01:14:58,743
she is the best.

665
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:02,038
Why, thank you, Wally. Hello, Betty.

666
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:03,999
Very pleased to meet you.

667
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:06,334
This is my assistant, Nicki.

668
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:10,005
Oh!
And the ever-lovely Martha.

669
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:12,757
Martha Johnson, whom you met out front.

670
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:16,887
Hi.

671
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:19,973
So, shall we... give it a go?

672
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:25,145
Uh, would you like a water
or a coffee before we begin?

673
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:27,147
No, I'm-I'm fine.

674
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:30,692
Well, then, let's everyone take a seat.

675
01:15:33,321 --> 01:15:34,696
Betty...

676
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:38,408
why don't you join Woody over there
and we'll play the scene.

677
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:42,954
Bob, do you have anything you wish to say?

678
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:46,041
Something to Betty before we begin?

679
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:48,793
No. It's not a contest.

680
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:54,257
The two of them, with themselves.

681
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:59,846
So don't play it for real...

682
01:15:59,931 --> 01:16:02,891
until it gets real.

683
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:09,314
Okay.

684
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:13,902
- Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
- What?

685
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:16,154
Hey, Bobby,
I wanna play this one nice and close...

686
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:18,073
like we did with that other girl –

687
01:16:18,157 --> 01:16:20,909
What's her name? The one with
the black hair. It felt kind of good.

688
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:22,911
- What do you think?
- That's good, Woody.

689
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:25,247
Just don't rush that line again.

690
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:28,917
I told you, the line
where you say, "Before what?"

691
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:32,712
Bobby, acting is reacting.

692
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:36,216
I just play off 'em. They all say, um...

693
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,218
"They're gonna arrest you," like that.

694
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:40,595
Then, "They'll put you in jail."
They all say it the same way.

695
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,889
So when they say it, I just react.

696
01:16:42,974 --> 01:16:44,432
- What's your name?
- Betty.

697
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:49,896
Yeah, Betty.
Look, you don't rush it, I don't rush it. Okay?

698
01:16:49,981 --> 01:16:52,899
Now, we're gonna play this
nice and close.

699
01:16:52,984 --> 01:16:55,860
Just like in the movies, okay?

700
01:16:58,364 --> 01:17:00,615
Dad's best friend goes to work.

701
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:04,035
Bob?

702
01:17:06,414 --> 01:17:09,374
And... action!

703
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:16,381
You're still here.

704
01:17:17,717 --> 01:17:21,469
I came back.
Thought that's what you wanted.

705
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:24,806
- Nobody wants you here.
- Really?

706
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:27,517
My parents are right upstairs.

707
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:29,519
They think you've left.

708
01:17:29,603 --> 01:17:31,563
So, surprise!

709
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:34,983
I can call them. I can call my dad.

710
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:37,027
But you won't.

711
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:55,253
You're playing a dangerous game here.

712
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:59,883
If you're trying to blackmail me...

713
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:02,093
it's not gonna work.

714
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:06,431
You know what I want.

715
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,433
It's not that difficult.

716
01:18:11,479 --> 01:18:13,438
Get out.

717
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:18,526
Get out before I call my dad.

718
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:20,862
He trusts you.

719
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:23,114
You're his...

720
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,325
best friend.

721
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:31,498
This will be the end of everything.

722
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:35,794
What about you?

723
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:38,213
What'll your dad think about you?

724
01:18:38,297 --> 01:18:39,839
Don't.

725
01:18:41,092 --> 01:18:43,009
Stop it.

726
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,721
That's what you said from the beginning.

727
01:18:48,808 --> 01:18:50,725
If I tell them what happened...

728
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:53,436
they'll arrest you and put you in jail.

729
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:02,570
So get out of here...

730
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,614
before –

731
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:09,661
Before what?

732
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:30,598
Before...

733
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:32,684
I kill you.

734
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:50,452
Well, then they'd put you in jail.

735
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:00,837
I hate you.

736
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:04,716
I hate us both.

737
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:23,485
- I'm gonna take her over there.
- Yeah, big time.

738
01:20:27,698 --> 01:20:29,616
Well, there it was.

739
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:32,994
Yeah, there it was, all right.

740
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:35,872
Baby, you've got a way with you. Really.

741
01:20:35,956 --> 01:20:37,707
Bob?

742
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:42,462
Very good. Really.

743
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:45,173
I mean, it was forced, maybe...

744
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:49,260
but still humanistic.

745
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:52,013
Yeah. Very good.

746
01:20:52,097 --> 01:20:54,933
Really. Really.

747
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:03,816
Oh, I thank you, Betty...

748
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:06,528
and I really mean that sincerely.

749
01:21:06,612 --> 01:21:09,531
I mean, it was extraordinary.

750
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:12,700
You've done your aunt proud today.

751
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:16,704
I am going to tell her that
first chance I get.

752
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:19,207
Now, you and I ...

753
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:21,209
are going to speak again very soon.

754
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:23,586
Thank you, Mr. Brown.

755
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:25,588
Thank you, Wally.

756
01:21:25,673 --> 01:21:29,008
I'm sure you all have a lot to talk about.
We'll walk Betty out.

757
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:33,012
Oh, well, yes, indeed.
And it was our pleasure, Linney.

758
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:35,598
Now, don't you be a stranger around here.

759
01:21:35,683 --> 01:21:38,643
- We'd love to have you here.
- Come on, Betty.

760
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:40,645
Thank you again, Mr. Brown.

761
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:45,733
And it was nice meeting all of you.
Bye.

762
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:49,070
Bye.

763
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:54,409
- Wow!
- She's a slam dunk.

764
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:56,411
Where the hell did you find her?

765
01:21:56,495 --> 01:21:58,663
God, that was awful.

766
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:02,750
Not you, Betty.
You were stellar. And I mean that.

767
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:04,544
But poor Wally.

768
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:06,838
- He'll never get that picture made.
- No.

769
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:09,215
Wally's days were up 20 years ago.

770
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:12,427
You know Woody Katz
is only doing it for a favor.

771
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:14,596
And the cast, I hear, so far is terrible.

772
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,764
Oh, God, terrible.

773
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:19,100
That poor old fool Wally.

774
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:23,104
He was very nice,
and he seemed so sweet.

775
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:26,149
And Wally – Mr. Brown –
is a very close friend of my aunt's, and –

776
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:29,193
Settle down, Betty.
Don't get me wrong. I love Wally.

777
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:32,905
I ought to.
I was married to him for 10 years.

778
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:35,950
And I love actors. All actors.

779
01:22:36,035 --> 01:22:39,287
We just get a little catty sometimes.

780
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:42,081
Now, we wanna take you across
and introduce you to a director...

781
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:44,083
who's a head above the rest.

782
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:47,045

You just show me where to sign.

Look, I love you...

822
01:24:58,177 --> 01:25:01,095
but there is no way they are gonna
let me cast this thing until I've seen everyone.

823
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:03,264

01:28:43,527 --> 01:28:45,069
- Do you know 'em?
- No.

880
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:49,240
Keep going.
Go around to the back.

881
01:29:38,457 --> 01:29:40,416
Selwyn, number 12.

882
01:30:03,857 --> 01:30:06,025
Now you got me scared.

883
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:34,720
You see? I told you there was
nothing to be afraid of.

884
01:31:37,367 --> 01:31:38,826
Betty, wait. Wait.

885
01:31:41,246 --> 01:31:42,872
Don't.

886
01:32:09,065 --> 01:32:10,608
No one's home.

887
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:13,527
Yes?

888
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:15,946
Diane?

889
01:32:18,575 --> 01:32:20,075
Number 17.

890
01:32:22,287 --> 01:32:24,246
But it said number 12.

891
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:30,127
I switched apartments with her.
She's in 17.

892
01:32:30,795 --> 01:32:32,796
It's down at the end on the left.

893
01:32:37,219 --> 01:32:40,221
But she hasn't been around
for a few days.

894
01:32:42,349 --> 01:32:44,767
Oh. We'll leave her a note.

895
01:32:44,851 --> 01:32:46,810
I'll go with you.

896
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:51,357
She's still got some of my stuff.

897
01:32:56,988 --> 01:32:59,073
You go ahead. I gotta get that.

898
01:33:14,631 --> 01:33:17,216
I guess you're not Diane Selwyn.

899
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:19,176
Guess I'm not.

900
01:33:56,214 --> 01:33:58,215
There's no one home, I guess.

901
01:34:27,996 --> 01:34:29,580
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

902
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:31,749
Come on. Help me in.

903
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:33,917
Come on.
I'll open the front door.

904
01:34:35,211 --> 01:34:36,795
No.

905
01:34:41,593 --> 01:34:43,177
Come on.

906
01:34:46,806 --> 01:34:48,265
Come on.

907
01:37:10,867 --> 01:37:12,784
Rita!

908
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:17,039
I know what you're doing.

909
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:40,521
I know what you have to do.

910
01:37:43,316 --> 01:37:45,275
But let me do it.

911
01:37:54,327 --> 01:37:56,286
Let me do it.

912
01:38:19,644 --> 01:38:21,812
You look like someone else.

913
01:38:44,168 --> 01:38:45,586
Good night, Betty.

914
01:38:46,462 --> 01:38:48,505
You don't have to wear that in the house.

915
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:50,591
What?

916
01:38:50,675 --> 01:38:52,426
The wig.

917
01:38:53,678 --> 01:38:56,972
Oh, I was just looking at myself again.

918
01:38:57,056 --> 01:38:58,974
I'll take it off to sleep.

919
01:38:59,058 --> 01:39:03,687
- And you don't have to sleep on that couch.
- No, it's okay.

920
01:39:03,771 --> 01:39:06,857
No, it's not. This is a huge bed.

921
01:39:06,941 --> 01:39:10,027
Come on. Just get in
and get a good night's sleep.

922
01:39:41,309 --> 01:39:43,477
It's more comfortable
than the couch, isn't it?

923
01:39:43,561 --> 01:39:46,563
Yes.

924
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:55,238
Thank you, Betty.

925
01:39:56,783 --> 01:39:58,950
It's nothing.

926
01:39:59,035 --> 01:40:01,328
I shouldn't have let you
sleep on the couch last night.

927
01:40:01,412 --> 01:40:04,122
No, I mean...

928
01:40:04,207 --> 01:40:07,084
thank you for everything.

929
01:40:10,421 --> 01:40:12,339
You're welcome.

930
01:40:22,517 --> 01:40:24,601
Good night, sweet Betty.

931
01:40:34,529 --> 01:40:36,488
Good night.

932
01:41:18,364 --> 01:41:20,657
Have you ever done this before?

933
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:24,786
I don't know.

934
01:41:24,871 --> 01:41:26,830
Have you?

935
01:41:40,344 --> 01:41:42,637
I want to with you.

936
01:42:08,998 --> 01:42:11,208
I'm in love with you.

937
01:42:26,098 --> 01:42:28,391
I'm in love with you.

938
01:42:55,336 --> 01:42:57,254
Silencio.

939
01:42:58,798 --> 01:43:00,757
Silencio.

940
01:43:02,552 --> 01:43:04,845
Silencio.

941
01:43:06,013 --> 01:43:08,431
No hay banda.

942
01:43:09,725 --> 01:43:12,853
No hay banda.

943
01:43:12,937 --> 01:43:14,855
No hay orquesta.

944
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:19,276
Silencio.

945
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:23,196
Silencio.

946
01:43:23,281 --> 01:43:25,824
Silencio.

947
01:43:28,119 --> 01:43:30,370
Silencio.

948
01:43:31,747 --> 01:43:33,790
Silencio.

949
01:43:34,917 --> 01:43:38,211
- Rita? Rita?
- No hay banda.

950
01:43:38,296 --> 01:43:40,422
Rita, wake up.

951
01:43:42,425 --> 01:43:46,553
- No. No.
- It's okay. It's okay.

952
01:43:46,637 --> 01:43:48,555
No, it's not okay.

953
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:50,891
What's wrong?

954
01:43:52,143 --> 01:43:54,769
Go with me somewhere.

955
01:43:57,106 --> 01:44:01,192
It's 2:00. It's 2:00 in the morning.

956
01:44:03,988 --> 01:44:05,947
Go with me somewhere.

957
01:44:07,408 --> 01:44:10,994
Sure. Now?

958
01:44:12,663 --> 01:44:15,415
Right now.

959
01:45:48,592 --> 01:45:52,679
No hay banda!

960
01:45:52,763 --> 01:45:56,057
There is no band!

961
01:45:56,142 --> 01:45:58,852
Il n'y a pas d'orchestre.

962
01:46:00,646 --> 01:46:03,356
This is all...

963
01:46:03,441 --> 01:46:05,775
a tape recording.

964
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:09,696
No hay banda, and yet...

965
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:11,281
we hear a band.

966
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:15,910
If we want to hear a clarinet...

967
01:46:15,995 --> 01:46:18,747
listen.

968
01:46:24,086 --> 01:46:26,504
Une trombone en coulisse.

969
01:46:32,136 --> 01:46:34,304
Un trombón con sordina.

970
01:46:36,474 --> 01:46:41,478
J'aime le son d'une trombone en sourdine.

971
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:52,697
A muted trumpet.

972
01:47:10,716 --> 01:47:13,343
It's all recorded.

973
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:19,015
No hay banda!

974
01:47:20,518 --> 01:47:24,020
It is all... a tape.

975
01:47:33,948 --> 01:47:37,534
Il n'y a pas d'orchestre.

976
01:47:37,618 --> 01:47:40,161
It is...

977
01:47:40,246 --> 01:47:42,288
an illusion.

978
01:47:46,877 --> 01:47:48,711
Listen!

979
01:49:02,536 --> 01:49:04,746
Señoras y señores...

980
01:49:04,830 --> 01:49:08,750
el Club Silencio les presenta...

981
01:49:08,834 --> 01:49:11,544

982
01:49:11,629 --> 01:49:15,089

Betty?

1041
01:54:14,097 --> 01:54:16,557
¿Dónde estás?

1042
01:54:29,404 --> 01:54:31,364
Betty?

1043
01:56:36,907 --> 01:56:38,908
Hmm.

1044
01:57:00,180 --> 01:57:01,514
Hey, pretty girl.

1045
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:05,101
Time to wake up.

1046
01:58:42,032 --> 01:58:45,618
- Where have you been?
- What do you want?

1047
01:58:45,702 --> 01:58:48,954
My lamp and dishes.

1048
01:58:50,415 --> 01:58:53,250
Come on, Diane. It's been three weeks.

1049
01:58:55,045 --> 01:58:58,506
I put your dishes in that box.

1050
01:59:18,819 --> 01:59:22,112
- That's my ashtray.
- Take it.

1051
01:59:33,083 --> 01:59:35,459
Anytime.

1052
01:59:35,544 --> 01:59:38,170
I'm just making sure, Diane.

1053
01:59:47,889 --> 01:59:49,431
This is it?

1054
01:59:49,516 --> 01:59:51,100
Yeah.

1055
01:59:55,564 --> 01:59:59,108
Oh, by the way, those two detectives
came by again looking for you.

1056
02:00:52,996 --> 02:00:55,122
Camilla.

1057
02:00:57,042 --> 02:00:59,501
You've come back.

1058
02:02:41,062 --> 02:02:44,189
What was that you were saying, beautiful?

1059
02:02:45,275 --> 02:02:47,568
I said...

1060
02:02:47,652 --> 02:02:49,653
"You drive me wild."

1061
02:03:02,834 --> 02:03:04,793
We shouldn't do this anymore.

1062
02:03:11,676 --> 02:03:13,635
Don't say that.

1063
02:03:18,808 --> 02:03:21,477
Don't ever say that.

1064
02:03:21,561 --> 02:03:23,896
Don't, Diane.

1065
02:03:23,980 --> 02:03:26,857
Stop it! Diane, stop!

1066
02:03:28,109 --> 02:03:30,486
I've tried to tell you this before.

1067
02:03:39,662 --> 02:03:41,955
It's him, isn't it?

1068
02:03:52,675 --> 02:03:55,719
Now, I'm not trying
to show you how to do the scene.

1069
02:03:55,804 --> 02:03:58,388
But just... watch me...

1070
02:03:58,473 --> 02:04:00,599
and I think you'll understand
what I'm getting at.

1071
02:04:00,683 --> 02:04:02,601
Hank.

1072
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:07,815
Don't sit so... rigid.

1073
02:04:07,899 --> 02:04:10,609
Just – Just relax.

1074
02:04:10,693 --> 02:04:13,445
Now, the two of you are alone...

1075
02:04:13,530 --> 02:04:15,656
and it's real comfortable...

1076
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:19,952
like you've known each other forever.

1077
02:04:20,036 --> 02:04:23,038
Even if you don't say anything,
it's-it's real comfortable.

1078
02:04:25,166 --> 02:04:27,084
Hank, can you just clear the set?

1079
02:04:27,168 --> 02:04:29,837
There's too many people around here.
Let us get this worked out.

1080
02:04:29,921 --> 02:04:32,422
Clear the set!
Clear the set, please!

1081
02:04:32,507 --> 02:04:34,550
Everyone have a cup of coffee.

1082
02:04:34,634 --> 02:04:38,053
- Everyone, please!
- Can Diane stay?

1083
02:04:38,138 --> 02:04:40,347
Yeah, sure. Diane can stay.

1084
02:04:40,431 --> 02:04:43,475
- Um, Hank, let Diane stay.
- Diane?

1085
02:04:49,774 --> 02:04:51,692
Now, when she starts to cry...

1086
02:04:51,776 --> 02:04:53,735
don't pull her towards you.

1087
02:04:55,405 --> 02:04:57,656
Let her fall into you.

1088
02:04:58,700 --> 02:05:00,659
Just let her fall.

1089
02:05:04,164 --> 02:05:06,123
Now, when you kiss her...

1090
02:05:07,584 --> 02:05:10,627
it's just a continuation of that move.

1091
02:05:12,463 --> 02:05:14,423
There's no break.

1092
02:05:40,450 --> 02:05:41,992
Kill the lights!

1093
02:05:51,794 --> 02:05:53,754
Don't be mad.

1094
02:05:53,838 --> 02:05:57,174
- Don't make it be like this.
- Oh, sure.

1095
02:05:57,258 --> 02:05:59,968
You want me to make this
easy for you? No.

1096
02:06:00,053 --> 02:06:03,138
No fucking way! It's not gonna be!

1097
02:06:03,223 --> 02:06:05,891
- It's not easy for me!
- Diane!

1098
02:07:30,101 --> 02:07:32,019
Hello, it's me.

1099
02:07:32,103 --> 02:07:34,229
Leave a message.

1100
02:07:36,274 --> 02:07:38,233
Diane?

1101
02:07:42,572 --> 02:07:45,449
- Hello?
- Diane?

1102
02:07:47,201 --> 02:07:51,330
- Camilla.
- Diane, the car's waiting.

1103
02:07:51,414 --> 02:07:53,373
Are you okay?

1104
02:07:53,458 --> 02:07:55,417
You coming?

1105
02:07:59,630 --> 02:08:03,008
- Uh-huh.
- Good.

1106
02:08:03,092 --> 02:08:05,010
It means so much to me.

1107
02:08:06,262 --> 02:08:08,889
Go on. The car's
right outside your house.

1108
02:08:10,099 --> 02:08:12,017
It's been waiting, okay?

1109
02:08:17,148 --> 02:08:19,024
Okay.

1110
02:08:19,108 --> 02:08:22,652
It's 6980 Mulholland Drive.

1111
02:08:24,113 --> 02:08:26,031
Mulholland Drive.

1112
02:09:35,726 --> 02:09:39,020
What are you doing?
We don't stop here.

1113
02:09:43,734 --> 02:09:46,153
A surprise.

1114
02:10:08,885 --> 02:10:10,844
Shortcut.

1115
02:10:13,181 --> 02:10:14,514
Come on, sweetheart.

1116
02:10:20,938 --> 02:10:23,148
It's beautiful.

1117
02:10:23,232 --> 02:10:25,108
A secret path.

1118
02:11:32,301 --> 02:11:34,302
Ah. Perfect timing.

1119
02:11:35,972 --> 02:11:37,931
Welcome, Diane.

1120
02:11:43,938 --> 02:11:45,438
Well...

1121
02:11:46,440 --> 02:11:48,483
here's to love.

1122
02:11:57,910 --> 02:11:59,411
Here's to love.

1123
02:12:04,834 --> 02:12:06,668
Ah, here she is.

1124
02:12:08,504 --> 02:12:10,422
Oh.

1125
02:12:16,220 --> 02:12:18,305
I don't believe you met my mother.

1126
02:12:19,849 --> 02:12:22,350
Hi. I'm Diane Selwyn.

1127
02:12:22,435 --> 02:12:25,103
Well, just call me Coco.
Everybody does.

1128
02:12:25,187 --> 02:12:27,606
Pleased to meet you.
Well, let's eat.

1129
02:12:27,690 --> 02:12:29,691
I'm starving.

1130
02:12:35,740 --> 02:12:38,033
I'm sorry I was late.

1131
02:12:57,720 --> 02:13:00,555
I'm from Deep River, Ontario.

1132
02:13:01,474 --> 02:13:03,350
A small town.

1133
02:13:03,434 --> 02:13:07,020
So you rolled in here from Canada.

1134
02:13:08,230 --> 02:13:10,565
I always wanted to come here.

1135
02:13:11,776 --> 02:13:14,486
I won this jitterbug contest.

1136
02:13:15,655 --> 02:13:17,572
That sort of led to acting.

1137
02:13:19,367 --> 02:13:21,910
You know, wanting to act.

1138
02:13:23,412 --> 02:13:25,413
When my aunt died –

1139
02:13:27,249 --> 02:13:30,835
Anyway, she – she left me some money.

1140
02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:33,588
- She worked here.
- In the movies?

1141
02:13:34,757 --> 02:13:36,424
Yes.

1142
02:13:37,426 --> 02:13:39,928
Well, how did you meet Camilla?

1143
02:13:41,597 --> 02:13:43,848
On The Sylvia North Story.

1144
02:13:43,933 --> 02:13:45,850
Oh, Camilla was great in that.

1145
02:13:57,822 --> 02:13:59,406
Yeah.

1146
02:14:01,117 --> 02:14:04,119
I wanted the lead so bad.

1147
02:14:05,371 --> 02:14:08,039
Anyway, Camilla got the part.

1148
02:14:11,460 --> 02:14:13,962
The director –

1149
02:14:14,046 --> 02:14:16,297
Bob Brooker?

1150
02:14:16,382 --> 02:14:17,966
Yes.

1151
02:14:20,553 --> 02:14:22,512
He didn't think so much of me.

1152
02:14:27,518 --> 02:14:30,603
Anyway, that's when we became friends.

1153
02:14:31,814 --> 02:14:33,732
She helped me...

1154
02:14:33,816 --> 02:14:37,318
getting some parts in some of her films.

1155
02:14:39,280 --> 02:14:40,822
I see.

1156
02:14:55,921 --> 02:14:58,631
So I got the pool...

1157
02:14:58,716 --> 02:15:00,759
and she got the pool man.

1158
02:15:00,843 --> 02:15:03,928
I couldn't believe it.

1159
02:15:04,013 --> 02:15:07,015
I wanted to buy that judge a Rolls-Royce.

1160
02:15:13,939 --> 02:15:15,857
Sometimes good things happen.

1161
02:16:09,954 --> 02:16:12,247
So I guess we've saved the best for last.

1162
02:16:15,251 --> 02:16:17,168
Do you wanna tell them?

1163
02:16:17,253 --> 02:16:19,170
No, y-you tell them.

1164
02:16:23,425 --> 02:16:25,343
Camilla and I ...

1165
02:16:37,940 --> 02:16:39,941
are going to be –

1166
02:16:51,829 --> 02:16:54,789
Sorry about that.

1167
02:17:01,171 --> 02:17:03,131
No, I'm fine.

1168
02:17:09,722 --> 02:17:11,556
This is the girl.

1169
02:17:13,309 --> 02:17:16,394
Don't show me this fuckin' thing here.

1170
02:17:16,478 --> 02:17:20,398
It's just an actress' photo resume.
Everybody's got one.

1171
02:17:21,817 --> 02:17:24,277
You got the money?

1172
02:17:24,361 --> 02:17:25,945
I sure do.

1173
02:17:37,499 --> 02:17:41,794
Okay, now, once you hand that over to me,
it's a done deal.

1174
02:17:44,715 --> 02:17:46,591
You sure you want this?

1175
02:17:52,348 --> 02:17:54,766
More than anything in this world.

1176
02:18:05,736 --> 02:18:09,030
When it's finished,
you'll find this where I told you.

1177
02:18:22,503 --> 02:18:24,420
What's it open?

1178
02:22:50,812 --> 02:22:53,189
Silencio.
