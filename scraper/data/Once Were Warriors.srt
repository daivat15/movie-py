1
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,300
Whoo-hoo!

2
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,100
G-a-b, hey! G-a-b, hey!

3
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,200
It's so much soul

4
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,000
Who's got the souls
of Rolling Stones?

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
On the road that's cold

6
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,700
What do we do? We G-a-b

7
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,800
With the groove, with the vibe

8
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,900
With the rhythm completely

9
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,200
Jump on the mike, I bet

10
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,600
We got soul, and don't you forget it

11
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,400
So come, come, come,
come, come again

12
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,700
I'm rocking on the mike

13
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,200
So much soul

14
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,500
We're young, we're hip

15
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,000
Get up, get up, get up,
get up, get up...

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,800
Come on, man. Let's go.

17
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,600
We've got soul

18
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,500
Uh, uh, uh, uh-huh

19
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,000
I got it, you got it

20
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,200
I got it, you got it

21
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,700
He's got soul

22
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,700
I got it, you got it

23
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,400
Here we go, here we go

24
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,000
You got it

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,500
1, 2, here we go again

26
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,600
Your mouth's ready to blow again

27
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,900
Making sure, jack...

28
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,800
"Reihi was a Taniwha.

29
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,800
"She lived at the bottom
of a huge lake.

30
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,900
"She spent most of her time

31
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,600
"taking care of a greenstone wall.

32
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,800
"The wall stopped the water

33
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,200
"from flooding over the people

34
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,700
"who lived by Reihi's lake.

35
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,200
"Once a month, the people would bring

36
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,900
"a huge piece of greenstone

37
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,100
to help Reihi keep the wall strong. "

38
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,500
especially if you drive around

39
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,700
the big towns, people.

40
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,500
Hope you love my wife, you know...

41
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,600
I was just checking out

42
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,800
the weather situation.

43
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,500
A few showers as well

44
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,500
and light winds at first,

45
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,400
but it's going to be getting better

46
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,100
throughout the day and the night...

47
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,200
A bit of cloud
and a bit of rain as well.

48
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,800
People, I've just had
a phone call from Darren.

49
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,800
Now, apparently, Darren's
just lost his girlfriend.

50
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,200
Brother...

51
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,800
I'd say we are in business, my man.

52
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,000
What's happening, everybody?

53
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,500
Aah!

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,700
Settle down!

55
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,300
"Then the children
would run and laugh

56
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,600
as they collected all the fish
Reihi had left for them. "

57
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,200
Was it a good story, kids?

58
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,000
Well, I liked it.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
No. It's dumb.

60
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,800
What's a Taniwha?

61
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,500
It's a creature
that looks after people.

62
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,700
Where the fuck is everyone?!

63
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,200
What are you doing home?

64
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,600
I got something for you.

65
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,700
Come on, Hu, let's go!

66
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,400
Go on, open it.

67
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,600
What do you reckon, kids?

68
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,800
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

69
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,500
Oh, yum!

70
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,200
- Oh, Jake!
- Look at all the kai moana!

71
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,500
Bloody oceans of the stuff!

72
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,000
- I'm hungry!
- Me, too!

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,800
Go on, kids. Grab some.

74
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,000
Take it outside.

75
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,400
Come on, Hu.

76
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,100
Got to eat them outside.

77
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,700
Where the fuck you off to?
Come have a feed, boy.

78
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,800
No.

79
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,700
Fuck him.

80
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,600
Jake, not on the table, hon.

81
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,000
Oh, why not? I want a feed.

82
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,400
Well, the kids might come in.

83
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,100
Well, what about the chair?

84
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,000
Remember?

85
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,900
So...

86
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,500
where did all the seafood come from?

87
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,900
I got lucky.

88
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,500
I got laid off.

89
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,000
What?

90
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,300
Whoa, whoa, woman. Let me finish.

91
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,400
Jake Heke, you've got
a family to feed.

92
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,300
- You've got bills.
- Look, I've signed up for the dole.

93
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,600
It's only 17 bucks a week
less than my wages.

94
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,100
Well, don't look like that.
It's not the end of the world.

95
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,200
What about our house?

96
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,000
We got a house,

97
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,600
and the government ain't
going to kick us out.

98
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,800
The rent's cheap.

99
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,100
I want us to have
our own home, Jake.

100
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,000
Damn you. We can't make
bloody ends meet as it is.

101
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,500
Forget the bloody house.

102
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,800
Let's talk about the bedroom.

103
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,900
Oh, don't, Jake!

104
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,300
You fucking got to spoil
everything, don't you?

105
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,900
Fuck you!

106
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,800
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah

107
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,700
Scoo da da do wa oh

108
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Ooh, I left this mark
on this world

109
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,200
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah

110
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,400
Scoo da da do wa oh

111
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,600
Yo, Toot.

112
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,500
Yo, G.

113
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,500
What you up to?

114
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,300
Oh, you know, a bit
of this and the other.

115
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,000
You never know when
the Queen might drop by.

116
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,700
Well, if she does,
here's something to feed her.

117
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,600
Bloody Santa Claus!

118
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,400
Do you think we'll ever
get out of here, Toot?

119
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,500
I don't know.

120
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,000
Maybe.

121
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,600
You know, when I'm old enough
to get the dole,

122
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,700
I might just do this baby up
and drive on out.

123
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,700
Can I come, too?

124
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,400
Of course. You're my best mate.

125
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,000
Hey, Gracie, did you
bring your book?

126
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,000
Oh, I forgot.

127
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,700
I just finished a new story, too,

128
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,200
but I can remember most of it.

129
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,400
Choice!

130
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,700
The story was about a Taniwha.

131
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,200
Do you know what a Taniwha is?

132
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,100
Well, Reihi was a Taniwha.

133
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,800
She lived at the bottom
of this lake.

134
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,600
Now, she spent most of her time

135
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,700
looking after this huge
greenstone wall.

136
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,200
The wall stopped the water

137
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,800
from flooding over the people

138
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,700
who lived by Reihi's lake.

139
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,600
Once a month, the people would bring...

140
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,700
Beth Heke?

141
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,200
What now?

142
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,000
Been keeping bad company.

143
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,400
Was that before or after
you picked him up?

144
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,200
So what's the charge?

145
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,300
Oh, he's lucky this time.

146
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,800
Two older boys stole the car.

147
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,700
He's just hanging around
with the wrong crowd.

148
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,300
Still, it's not going
to look good tomorrow

149
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,500
when he appears in court
on those other charges.

150
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,200
You think you know everything
about us, don't you?

151
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,700
It's my job.

152
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,500
Is she a Taniwha, Mom?

153
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,100
No, son.

154
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,300
Well, we'll leave
Boogie with you, then.

155
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,700
- Mark.
- Pardon?

156
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,700
My son's name is Mark.

157
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,800
Well, that's not
the name he gave us.

158
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,400
You get those lonely, lonely

159
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
Lonely, lonely blues

160
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,000
When you're on your own.

161
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,900
Mm-hmm

162
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,400
So all you've got to do

163
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,500
Is call up on the phone

164
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,900
No need to be alone.

165
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,100
Mm-hmm

166
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,000
And if you lose your way

167
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,200
And you've got nowhere to go...

168
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,800
The usual.

169
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,100
What's your fucking problem?

170
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,800
Check that out, bro.

171
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,700
The man can sure pack a punch.

172
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,600
He's been behind bars, I bet.

173
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,000
Yeah, right. Bloody zoo.

174
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,600
If I wanted to drink with women,

175
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,500
I'd drink in the bloody
lounge bar, huh?

176
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,100
I've had women up to here.

177
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,700
Come on, Polly. Help your sister.

178
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,400
Set the table, girl.

179
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,800
There are reports that they've had

180
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,300
at least one sighting of the Virgin.

181
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,800
Oh, no wonder we got it...

182
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,900
Why, Boog?

183
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,200
Don't know.

184
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,400
You don't know?

185
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,600
Do you know you
have to go to court tomorrow?

186
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,300
Do you remember what Bennett said?

187
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,400
Jeez, Boog, what's
bloody wrong with you?

188
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,300
Don't know.

189
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,400
When you were a kid,
you wouldn't even take

190
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
a piece of fruit without asking.

191
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,300
You're going to come
tomorrow, aren't you, Mom?

192
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,000
Yes, we'll be there. Will you?

193
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,400
Yeah. Just keep your hands

194
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,700
in your pockets there, brother.

195
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,100
Come on, bro. I'd just
like to see them smile.

196
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,000
Oh, you mean like this?

197
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,500
You dirty bastard.

198
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,000
I can make mine smile all right.

199
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,500
I just can't make the woman happy.

200
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,900
I took a big feed
of seafood home today...

201
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,000
bloody everything.

202
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,800
Just wanted to put
a smile on her face.

203
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,900
You think she'd let me? No chance.

204
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,700
All I told her was I got laid off.

205
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,800
Anyone would have thought I told her

206
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,600
that my prick dropped off.

207
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,600
Laid off twice in one day, eh, bro?

208
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,400
Poor bastard.

209
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,300
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

210
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,200
You're leaving home in the morning

211
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,200
You come on home in the night

212
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,200
Ooh, babe...

213
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,000
Fucking beautiful.

214
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,800
And when I ask you, babe

215
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,400
You just say, you're right

216
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,900
But you don't know

217
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,700
What my heart's been going through

218
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,100
Staying up late

219
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,000
Just waitin' on you

220
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,600
When will you be the one for me?

221
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,200
Oh, yeah, without your love

222
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,200
I can't make it

223
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,700
You're all...

224
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,800
Gee, where did you
get those muscles from?

225
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,200
Bro, you've been lifting
those weights, huh?

226
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,600
What, you've done lag?
Am I right?

227
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,200
You want to fuck with me?

228
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,400
You should learn
to pay your respects.

229
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
In case you want
to know, it's Jake...

230
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,100
Jake the Muss.

231
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,400
Mmm, loving you is all I need, boy

232
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,700
I was right... too much weights,
not enough speed work.

233
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,600
Useless prick.

234
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,500
Cheers.

235
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,400
Into me

236
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,200
Am I not enough for you...

237
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,000
Party at my place tonight, boys.

238
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,600
Come on, Poll. Bed.

239
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,800
Come on, Hu.

240
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Hurry up, Polly.

241
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,000
Thanks, Bub.

242
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,700
- Good night, Mum.
- Night-night, Polly.

243
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,100
You, too, mister.

244
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,500
You've got a big day tomorrow.

245
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,600
You won't forget, eh, Mum?

246
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,800
How can I forget

247
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,600
with you reminding me
every 5 minutes?

248
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,300
Good night, son.

249
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,900
Good night, Mum.

250
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,600
Whoo-hoo!

251
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,900
Your old man was
sure swinging tonight.

252
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,000
He'll be swinging, all right,

253
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,400
by the time I've finished with him.

254
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,400
Did you hear he got the sack?

255
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,500
Doesn't surprise me, girl...

256
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,800
days he took off.

257
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,300
Beth, babe.

258
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,200
Dooley!

259
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,900
You should have seen
the Muss in action.

260
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,800
It was beautiful.

261
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,900
He decked a bloody gorilla.

262
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,400
He was big. Man, was he big.

263
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,000
Fucking huge.

264
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It has to be said...

265
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,900
almost as big as that
thing in Bully's pants.

266
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,200
Notice he said almost, ladies?

267
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,700
Yeah, right.

268
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,800
Hey, girl, you should have
seen him, though.

269
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,800
Dool's right... big...

270
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,400
and bloody ugly.

271
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,200
Well, he didn't get
everything right, though.

272
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,400
Well, it's just that Bully
isn't that big, girl.

273
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

274
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,600
Mmm, you're hot tonight, girl.

275
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,400
Yeah, ever since Jake

276
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,300
put his hand halfway up my skirt.

277
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,900
Ooh, I might have to
go home early tonight.

278
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,000
Yo, Mave. Give us a song.

279
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,300
Come on, Mave!

280
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,500
How about you and Beth sing for me?

281
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,400
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

282
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,000
OK, OK, OK.

283
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,200
Give us a G. Give us a G.

284
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,100
Well, I've tried

285
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

286
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,100
As hard as I can

287
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,800
Just to make you

288
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,700
Understand

289
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,400
'Cause the world

290
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,000
It won't stop

291
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It keeps goin'

292
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,000
Goin' round and round

293
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,700
I guess the nature

294
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,800
The nature of love

295
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,800
Hurts always, always

296
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,500
What are you doing?

297
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,900
Couldn't you sleep, either?

298
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,900
Aren't they beautiful
when they're like that?

299
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,800
I wish I could see them.

300
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,600
I remember

301
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,000
They're just drunk. That's all.

302
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
All those yesterdays

303
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,600
People show their true feelings
when they're drunk.

304
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,400
Understanding

305
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,600
Man, Gracie, you've got
some far-out ideas.

306
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,300
I thought Mum said
you were growing up.

307
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,000
At least I'm not going
to court tomorrow.

308
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,900
Oh, sorry, Boog.

309
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,200
I didn't mean it.

310
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,800
Oh, what the hell.

311
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,500
What's the worst that can happen?

312
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,200
The nature of love

313
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,600
And it's always,
always been this way

314
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,600
So, now, my lover

315
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,200
There'll be no other

316
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,000
The stars in the heavens

317
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,400
Will shine forever

318
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,200
Moments we treasure

319
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,800
You and I in love

320
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,200
So, darlin'

321
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,200
Here is my heart

322
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,500
So, darlin'

323
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,900
Here is my heart

324
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,200
So, darlin'

325
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,200
Here is my heart

326
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,900
Ohh

327
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,400
Yeah

328
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,100
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

329
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,000
You're a hard lady, Bethie.

330
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,300
And you're a hard man, Jakey.

331
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,500
Play another one, someone.

332
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,000
Next time, watch what you say

333
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,400
in front of the fucking women!

334
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,700
How's that for true feelings?

335
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
Oh, don't play that shit, friend.

336
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,800
Play something we all know.

337
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,700
Later!

338
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,300
Have a feed. Have a feed.

339
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,100
Have a feed.

340
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,700
Hey, Mavis, come have
a drink with me, mate!

341
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,200
What's up with bloody Millie?

342
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,600
Is she spoiling the party, or what?

343
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,000
Too much gin and not enough sex.

344
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,600
Hey, hey, hey.

345
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,200
I'm not going to miss out tonight.

346
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,500
Dooley, eh?

347
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,800
Strike when the pants
are ready to drop.

348
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,000
Looks like they've
already dropped, Mave.

349
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,000
Bloody bastard!

350
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,400
Never mind him, Mave.
Come have a feed.

351
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,200
There's still a bit left
in the bottom.

352
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,400
Dooley, what the fuck
are you doing?

353
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,800
You're with me!

354
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,600
Got any money?

355
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,000
Money?

356
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,600
What for?

357
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,600
You don't need money.

358
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,400
You got everything
you want right here.

359
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,700
You got booze, food.

360
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,400
The old man.

361
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,900
Don't give me your bullshit excuses!

362
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,000
Come on. Let's go.

363
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,900
Have a drink with me, son.

364
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,300
Remember how we used to
talk and laugh?

365
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,800
We could talk and talk,
you and me.

366
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,200
Remember?

367
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,800
You're drunk.

368
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,800
I'm not drunk.

369
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
I'm happy.

370
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,800
Then you're out of your fuckin' head.

371
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,700
Oh, I'm so sorry, babe.

372
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,400
I didn't... hang on.

373
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,000
Hang on, son. I got some money.

374
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,700
Hey, cook us some eggs, eh, Beth?

375
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,600
Ooh, and some bacon.

376
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,400
Fuck off!

377
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,600
What the fuck's going on?

378
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,500
I asked for some eggs, but...

379
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,400
Cook the man some eggs.

380
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,200
You want eggs?

381
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,500
Well, have the bloody lot of them!

382
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,600
It's OK, man.

383
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,600
Cook the man some fucking eggs.

384
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,100
Do it yourself, Jake!

385
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,700
I'm not the fuckin' slave
around here, Jake!

386
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,200
No, you can...

387
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,400
You're a fuckin' coward!

388
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,200
Leave her alone,
you fucking bastard!

389
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,600
Stop it! Stop it!

390
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,100
It's OK, Poll.

391
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,600
Shh! Shh!

392
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,200
Shush, Hu.

393
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,900
Shh!

394
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,200
I want Mummy!

395
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,300
Shush, Hu.

396
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,500
It's OK, Poll.

397
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,200
Your fuckin' mouth!

398
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,600
You do as you're fucking told!

399
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,600
Fuck. Last time, I got 20 bucks.

400
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,400
So what are you up to, Gracie?

401
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,600
You could help.

402
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,500
Not me. Waste of bloody time.

403
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,500
You should leave it.

404
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,700
There'll be plenty of time
for you to clean up

405
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,400
after drunken fucking parties.

406
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,200
What do you mean?

407
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,400
When you get married, girl.

408
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,000
Who said I want to?

409
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,800
It's just the way things are.

410
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,200
No. The fellas around here
are too ugly.

411
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,100
It's just a matter of time, Gracie.

412
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,900
Who did the prick smack over?

413
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,100
Grace?

414
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,000
The fuckin' bastard!

415
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,100
Where are you going?

416
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,800
Out of this fuckin' hole!

417
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,600
They've eaten the whole lot.

418
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,200
I'm hungry.

419
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,800
How about some Chinese?

420
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,600
Yuck!

421
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,800
Where's Mum?

422
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,200
Well, she's not bloody here, is she?

423
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,500
Look, there's one more pea.

424
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,900
Mum?

425
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,100
Yeah, I know, Boog.

426
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,100
Do you want an aspirin?

427
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,200
Listen, Boog...

428
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,400
Grace can go with you, eh?

429
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,900
Give a good impression.

430
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,800
I'm not feeling the best, son.

431
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,200
Just give me time to wash up.

432
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,000
Nothing that a good
coffee won't fix.

433
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,300
I'll catch a later bus.

434
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,500
OK, Boog?

435
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,800
Ya, sure.

436
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,200
We love the reggae girls,
we love the reggae girls

437
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,200
The reggae music make you
jump and stomp, yes

438
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,400
The reggae music make you
dance and prance, yes

439
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,800
So everybody come
and shake your butt, yes

440
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,100
'Cause this the music,
and I'm the best, yes

441
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,800
And this is something
that they must confess, yes...

442
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,400
Do you reckon we should go in?

443
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,800
Nah. Wait for Mum.

444
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,400
Come on, son. We're running late.

445
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,100
Didn't I tell you I was
picking you up this morning?

446
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,600
Forgot.

447
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,600
Come on.

448
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,600
Bit of trouble
at your place last night.

449
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,200
Look, Mark, I have to be honest.

450
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,200
You're on remand.

451
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,600
The cops say they
found you on the streets.

452
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,800
They're going to try
and persuade the judge

453
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,800
that your parents can't control you.

454
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I've seen your mother.

455
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,600
I don't think she's going
to make it here this morning.

456
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,800
She's going to catch a later bus.

457
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,400
- Morning.
- Hi.

458
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,800
Mark, you ready? Better go in.

459
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,600
Come on.

460
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,900
Nig Heke, eh?

461
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,800
Son of Jake the Muss.

462
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,200
You a bit of a chip off
the old block, boy?

463
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,000
I'm nothing like him.

464
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,000
Yeah, we'll see.

465
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,700
So today's the day, boy.

466
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,600
Judgment day.

467
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,500
How bad do you want in?

468
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,200
Didn't hear you, boy.

469
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,300
I want a patch.

470
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,100
You hear that, brothers?

471
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,800
He wants a patch.

472
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,600
You'll have to get through me first.

473
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,000
Do all right with women, boy?

474
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,100
I do all right.

475
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,800
Must be your flashy smile, eh?

476
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,200
Value your teeth?

477
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,000
You like your pretty-boy face.

478
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,500
Call you Michael Jackson,

479
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,000
except we'll rearrange it for free.

480
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,200
You think about that, boy,

481
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,300
before you think about any patch.

482
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,800
Is that right, Mark?

483
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,600
You admit to the burglaries?

484
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,600
And what about these
motor-vehicle charges?

485
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,600
Will you be withdrawing those?

486
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,200
Yes, your honor, but we recommend

487
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,800
that Mark goes into
social welfare custody.

488
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,200
Take your hat off, please, sergeant.

489
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,800
We picked him up yesterday.

490
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Sir, it's pretty clear
that his parents

491
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,100
can't look after him.

492
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,300
And, um...

493
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,300
what do you two have?

494
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,800
I'm in a difficult position.

495
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,400
I've had no contact
with Mark's parents, and...

496
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,400
Yes, well, I was hoping

497
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,000
the boy's mother would be here today.

498
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,000
I was around there this morning,

499
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,700
and after what I saw...

500
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I don't think Mark
should be at home.

501
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,800
Yes. Yes. All right.

502
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,600
Things seem to be going
from bad to worse

503
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,400
for you, don't they, Mark?

504
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Under the circumstances,

505
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,800
if your parents can't control you,

506
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,400
I'll have to remand you
in social welfare custody.

507
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,300
Nig Heke's brother.

508
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,800
Looks like a fucking poofter to me.

509
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,400
Baby, you can fuck
with me any day.

510
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,300
Now, you can either
do this the hard way,

511
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,800
or you can make it work for you.

512
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,000
- It's your choice.
- What do you mean?

513
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,000
You can let me help you,

514
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,900
and you might learn something,

515
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,300
or you could end up in jail.

516
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,400
Because that's where you're heading.

517
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,100
Sorry to interrupt.
Can I see you a moment?

518
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,400
Uh, yeah. I'll see you outside.

519
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,600
Please try, Boog.

520
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,200
It can't be that bad, eh?

521
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,200
At least you'll be doing
something different.

522
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,600
Hey, I could even write to you.

523
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,800
I've never had anyone
to write to before.

524
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,200
Gee, girl, you started without me.

525
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,000
Jeez, woman, is that the result

526
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
of one hell of an orgasm or what?

527
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,200
What the hell happened?

528
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,300
Same old story.

529
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,300
Never learn to keep my mouth shut.

530
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,400
Help yourself to a beer.

531
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,400
Ah, what the hell.

532
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Surprised there's any left.

533
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,800
Well, you know the rules, girl.

534
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,800
Keep your mouth shut
and your legs open.

535
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,700
Didn't get to court, then, eh?

536
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,400
Like this?

537
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,100
Do more harm than good.

538
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,600
Welfare came round this morning.

539
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,000
Promised Boog I'd be there for him.

540
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
That boy's got to learn
to stand on his own two feet.

541
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,900
You're going to
have to take a chain saw

542
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,200
to those apron strings, girl.

543
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,200
He's not strong
like the others, Mave.

544
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,300
Ah, shit. I remember
when he was a wee fella.

545
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,300
Couldn't tear him off you.

546
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,100
He'll be all right.

547
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,200
It's Nig I'd worry about.

548
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,300
It doesn't seem
like that long ago

549
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,800
that Nig was a baby.

550
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,200
Well, he's not a baby anymore,

551
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,900
that's for sure!

552
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,000
Jeez, you should have
seen Jake, Mave,

553
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,800
boasting about his baby boy...

554
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,200
till Nig started crying at night.

555
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,100
That's about when those
two parted company.

556
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,900
Ain't that the truth?
Bloody men.

557
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,500
Jeez, he was a beautiful baby, Mave.

558
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,900
Oh, enough bloody talk, girl.

559
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,200
Hit the fella over the head!

560
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,000
Tell him to wake his ideas up.

561
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,300
Bloody gangs.

562
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,700
Kati!

563
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,400
So how you doing, boy?

564
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,800
The brothers can't hear you, boy.

565
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,800
Timata!

566
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,100
Kati!

567
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,900
Brother,

568
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,600
now you've met your new family.

569
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,500
Grace!

570
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,800
I wanted to be there, Grace.

571
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,300
I couldn't.

572
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,400
They'd have sent him away.

573
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,800
You've seen the state of me, Bub.

574
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,200
They did.

575
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,900
They did, Mum.

576
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,000
They sent Boog away.

577
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,000
But how can they do that...

578
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,200
just take someone's son away?

579
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,400
It's OK, Mum.

580
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,400
Boog seemed OK.

581
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,100
He should be at home with us.

582
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,300
Can't a man get some
fuckin' sleep around here?

583
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,000
Fuck, woman, you look fucking awful.

584
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,200
Go clean yourself up.

585
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,900
This is as cleaned up

586
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,400
as I get, you bastard.

587
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,800
Tried getting cleaned up
all morning

588
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,600
so I could go to court with our son.

589
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,700
Our son, Jake!

590
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,700
What the fuck's Nig been up to?

591
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,400
You have no idea, do you?

592
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,900
Boogie!

593
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,700
Boogie? Is that right?

594
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,800
He's gone, Jake.

595
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,300
He's gone to welfare, and you slept

596
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,100
through the whole bloody thing.

597
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,400
Is that all?

598
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,000
Is that what all this
slamming of fucking doors,

599
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,600
crying, and carrying on is about?

600
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,500
Fuck!

601
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,600
The boy is soft.

602
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,800
It'll toughen him up.

603
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,300
Anyone would think
he bloody died or something.

604
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,300
Hey, so go do something
about the way you look.

605
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,000
You're starting to
make me feel fucking sick.

606
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,800
You did this to me, you bastard.

607
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,500
I hope you spew your guts out.

608
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,400
You know your fucking
problem, eh, woman?

609
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,500
You're too bloody lippy,

610
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,800
too bloody smart-mouthed.

611
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,800
You're a bad example
for the fucking kids.

612
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,200
Always writing, aren't you?
Too fucking smart.

613
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,200
You'll end up like
your mother here.

614
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,200
I hate him.

615
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,000
Bring your book here, Bub.

616
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,000
What you been writing?

617
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,800
I was going to write to Boog.

618
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,600
You got a good nature, girl.

619
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,200
Mr. Bennett said we could visit.

620
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,900
It's all right for those fellas.

621
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,500
They've got everything
at their fingertips...

622
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,000
flashy car, plenty of money.

623
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,600
Easy for them.

624
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,100
Knew we couldn't.

625
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,200
I didn't say we couldn't.

626
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
It just won't be easy.

627
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,900
Got to find the money.

628
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,700
Do you think we could?

629
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,200
Yes. Yes, I do.

630
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I promise.

631
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,600
I love you, Mum.

632
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,600
I love you, too, Bub.

633
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,100
Come and suck on this.

634
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,600
You fellas are too ugly.

635
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,200
Did you hear? Boog got sent away.

636
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,500
Yeah, I heard.

637
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,800
- Boys' home, right?
- Ya.

638
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,500
- You want a puff?
- Nah.

639
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,400
Well, yeah. Why not?

640
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,600
He's going to be OK, though.

641
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,600
And you know why?

642
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,500
Because Mum said we can visit...

643
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,900
you know, as a family.

644
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,300
Isn't that choice?

645
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,300
Yeah. Yeah. Choice.

646
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,200
What do you think
it'll be like?

647
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,500
What? The boys' home?

648
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,300
Got to be better than this car.

649
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,400
You going to hold on to that

650
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,400
till it goes out?

651
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,700
Oh. Sorry.

652
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,200
You're the only one
I can talk to.

653
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,100
You know that, Toot?

654
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,100
Yeow, G. Best mates...

655
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,000
forever.

656
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,400
250 smackeroonies.

657
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,900
Fuckin' beautiful.

658
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,700
Fuckin' tin-ass.

659
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,100
Must be your shout, eh, bro?

660
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,600
Yeah, all right, all right.

661
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,500
Well, bloody hell.

662
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,000
I should have brought
the video camera.

663
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,600
Get out and stay out,

664
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,600
you fucking bastard!

665
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,500
Hey, Muss.

666
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,000
Have a win on the Gigis, Muss?

667
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,000
Look at the bloody
state of you, man.

668
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,600
You're a fucking mess.

669
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,500
Don't you ever speak
to me again, you hear?

670
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,400
You might spoil my night.

671
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,900
Good evening, ladies.

672
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,800
I've just had a bit of a windfall,

673
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,200
and since you're looking
so bloody beautiful,

674
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,100
I thought I might buy
you gals a drink,

675
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,100
especially the one
standing here

676
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,300
in his fucking party dress.

677
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,900
Barman, 6 milk shakes, eh?

678
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,900
Easy on the ice cream.

679
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,000
Ooh. Forget it, lady.

680
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,900
You looked better
before you turned around.

681
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,600
Fuck, boy, you're too much.

682
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,900
If you want to be
like your old man,

683
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,400
learn how to stand
on your own two feet.

684
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,600
Fuck. Is that your old man?

685
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,000
Piss off.
I don't have an old man.

686
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,000
You're still a bloody
attractive woman.

687
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,300
You mean after you
take to me with your fists?

688
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,800
You make me sick.

689
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,800
Oh, hon, you still
on about the other week?

690
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,400
I told you, I'm sorry.

691
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,800
And I told you
when I get like that,

692
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,600
get out of my way.

693
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,000
But you have to get
all lippy on me.

694
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,400
I got a temper on me,
but who hasn't?

695
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,000
You're priceless.

696
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,800
Well, at least I try
to make it up to you.

697
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,300
Get off me, Jake.

698
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,200
Oh, you're a hard lady.

699
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,100
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

700
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,600
Sit down and keep a man company.

701
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,000
I've got things to think about.

702
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,200
Like what?

703
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,600
Since when were you interested?

704
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,100
Well, if you can't tell

705
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,600
by the way I just grabbed you,

706
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,800
I must be losing my touch.

707
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,600
If you're not gonna take me
seriously, Jake...

708
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,200
Take it easy. Talk to Jakey.

709
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,800
It's just...

710
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,900
It's just what?

711
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,800
Jeez, you're pretty.

712
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,600
I want us to visit Boogie.

713
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,100
Is that all?

714
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,400
Go together, as a family.

715
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,100
You know, make a day of it,

716
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,000
take up a nice picnic lunch.

717
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,200
Maybe we could rent
a car for the day.

718
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,600
Oh, yeah. Maybe we could
fuckin' fly.

719
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,000
It's not impossible, Jake.

720
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,400
I've worked it out.

721
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,100
There's the money Auntie Matawai
sent me at Christmas.

722
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:55,600
If I put a bit aside each week

723
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,400
from the housekeeping,

724
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,400
in a month, maybe we could go.

725
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,900
Please, Jake?

726
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,500
And this whole day
means a lot to you, huh?

727
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,200
Yes.

728
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,600
Book the fuckin' limousine.

729
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,800
Horses, babe.

730
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,400
Honest.

731
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,000
Now, will you come here?

732
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,000
Tell Jakey you love him.

733
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,800
That's the trouble,
Jake. I do.

734
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,200
- What's going on?
- It's Heke, sir.

735
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,200
He's got your taiaha, sir.

736
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:00,800
If you want to smash things, boy,

737
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,700
you start with me!

738
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,400
You think you're man enough
to hold a taiaha, boy?

739
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,700
I hate this fucking place!

740
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,600
You're not supposed to like it!

741
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,200
Let me go, you black bastard!

742
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:16,500
We are the same color, boy!

743
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:35,700
The British used to think

744
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,400
the bayonet was the most lethal

745
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,900
of all hand-to-hand
combat weapons,

746
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,700
till they came across our warriors,

747
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,500
who fought with a taiaha.

748
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,400
You think your fist
is your weapon?

749
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,000
When I have taught you,

750
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,900
your mind will be.

751
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:01,000
You'll carry your
taiaha inside you.

752
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,500
Come on.

753
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,900
Whoa, this is the life, eh, kids?

754
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,200
Don't even have to change gears.

755
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:44,000
Want to come and visit
your brother, son?

756
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,400
Nah. Got something else on.

757
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,600
Oh, come on, son...
as a family.

758
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,800
What? Too fucking busy
to visit your own brother, boy?

759
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,200
Rather be with a pack of wankers.

760
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,400
He would have come, Jake,

761
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,400
if you would have waited.

762
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,900
He would have.

763
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,800
Visits don't start
till after lunch.

764
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,500
We may as well take
a drive, eh, kids?

765
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,200
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

766
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,900
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

767
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,400
What's the time?

768
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,700
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

769
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:41,100
What's the time?

770
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,500
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

771
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,900
What's the time?

772
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,700
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

773
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,300
What's the time?

774
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:51,500
I said 1:00

775
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,600
2:00

776
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,800
3:00

777
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,900
4:00

778
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,200
5:00

779
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,500
6:00

780
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,800
Spooly, spooly,
spooly ooly dooly booly

781
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,800
7:00

782
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,100
8:00

783
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,300
9:00, widdly widdly widdly,
wee, wee, oh

784
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,800
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

785
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,500
What's the time?

786
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,000
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?
What's the time?

787
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
What's that place over there, Mum?

788
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,200
Taku Whenua Tuturu.

789
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,500
My piece of dirt.

790
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,600
That's where I was
brought up, kids.

791
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,000
What's that big house
over there, Mum?

792
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,400
That's the Wharenui.

793
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,000
It was a lot different
when I was a girl.

794
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,400
It was always impressive.

795
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,300
What's impressive?

796
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,600
Choice.

797
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,600
It was always choice.

798
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:44,900
And inside are the most

799
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,700
choicest carvings.

800
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,200
Go on, mum.

801
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,400
Oh, and inside are photos

802
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,900
of the old people

803
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,400
and the Tukutuku panels.

804
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,100
You know, I used to help Nannie

805
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,800
and Auntie Matawai repair them.

806
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,300
Well, why don't we
ever go there, Mum?

807
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,400
One day we'll all end up there.

808
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,000
See over there to the right?

809
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,600
That's the Urupa...

810
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,600
the family cemetery.

811
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,500
All my family are buried there.

812
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,600
I'd love to go and see them.

813
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,600
Not before me, you don't.

814
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,800
Your father and I
were going to get hitched there.

815
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,600
Except we didn't.

816
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:33,400
I wasn't bloody good enough...

817
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,300
not for their royal highness.

818
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,400
Tell them everything,
why don't you?

819
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,300
Your mother was beautiful...

820
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,700
pride of the fucking tribe...

821
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,100
And this old black-ass comes along

822
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:56,000
and steals her away.

823
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,600
And you know where
I come from, kids?

824
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,400
A long line of slaves.

825
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,300
Fucking slaves.

826
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,300
I'd like to see those wankers

827
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,400
call Jake the Muss that now.

828
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,600
Ah, this place gives me the creeps.

829
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,500
Come on, kids.

830
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,800
Doesn't give me the creeps.

831
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,400
You never met my grandmother.

832
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,800
Eh, Jake?

833
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,400
Jake?

834
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,800
Just want to show
our flash car to my mates.

835
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,800
Whoa, bro, you know what
the penalty is for car theft?

836
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,400
Just one beer, huh?

837
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,200
One, Jake.

838
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,700
Just the one.

839
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,000
Promise?

840
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,400
Cross my heart.

841
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,300
Cheer.

842
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,400
Cheer.

843
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,600
Ah, cheer.

844
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,400
Cheer, bro.

845
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,800
Cheer.

846
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,100
Cheer.

847
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,800
How long is Dad gonna be?

848
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,100
I'd get that tone out of your voice

849
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,700
if I were you.

850
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,600
How many times have
you seen your father

851
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,200
like today, Grace?

852
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,600
Never... that's how many,

853
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,000
so just give him a chance, eh?

854
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:43,900
Now running on the track,

855
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,400
it's Robin the Fair...

856
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,300
Bethie! Name your poison.

857
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,200
Oh, no, thanks, Dooley.

858
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,200
Jake and I are going to
visit our son Boogie.

859
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,600
- Aren't we, Jake?
- Yeah, yeah. Just a minute.

860
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,200
I'm trying to listen
to the horse race.

861
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,200
You promised, Jake.

862
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:56,900
Shut up, woman.

863
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,000
You'll make me miss
who won the fuckin' race.

864
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,200
The kids are hungry.

865
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:00,900
Well, feed them.

866
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,400
You got bootloads of the stuff.

867
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,400
We'll be waiting.

868
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:10,100
Come on, come on.
Come up, come up.

869
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,100
So he's not coming?

870
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,000
Oh, he's coming, all right.

871
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:24,800
You're hopeful.

872
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,700
No, Grace.

873
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,100
It's just a woman's
lot, that's all.

874
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:32,000
One day you'll understand.

875
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:09,600
No, no, no, no, no, no.

876
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,200
Stop, stop.

877
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,800
It's good, but it's
not good enough!

878
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,400
I've told you fellas
time and again,

879
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,300
this haka won't work

880
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,600
until you get the first action right!

881
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,600
You're reaching up
for all these ancestral lines,

882
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:26,500
and you're pulling them
down into your body!

883
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,100
The weight of your ancestors.

884
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,100
Some of you look
as though you're reaching

885
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:33,300
for butterflies or something.

886
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,000
Now, let's do it again...

887
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,700
and wake up!

888
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,400
And I in love

889
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:51,000
So, darling, here is my heart

890
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,600
Give me the keys, Jake.

891
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,400
I said, give me the keys.

892
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,600
What for?

893
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,200
I'm going to visit Boogie.

894
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,100
Bad idea.

895
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,000
The problem is
you've spoiled the boy.

896
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:01,900
You've got to toughen him up.

897
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,700
Give me the bloody keys!

898
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:05,200
That's it, woman. Just fuck off!

899
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,700
Take a bloody taxi.

900
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:09,100
You got all my bloody money.

901
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,600
Fuck.

902
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,400
I remember

903
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,100
All those yesterdays

904
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,700
Come on kids.

905
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,700
We'll walk around
to the taxi stand.

906
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,300
Taxi? What for?

907
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,600
We're going home.

908
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,700
No. We're going to see Boogie.

909
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,200
You promised.

910
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,200
Please, Grace, try to understand.

911
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,600
I don't want to listen
to any more of your lies.

912
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,800
I hate you! I hate you both!

913
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:59,300
Come on, kids.

914
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,900
Boogie? Son?

915
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,300
We were on our way.

916
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,500
We rented a car for the trip.

917
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,700
We had a bit of an accident, son.

918
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,300
Oh, well, you know

919
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,000
what your father's like

920
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,200
when he gets behind the wheel.

921
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,500
Had a picnic lunch all prepared.

922
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,600
Stayed up all last night.

923
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,600
I got in just what you like.

924
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,500
It was just a stupid accident.

925
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,600
Whoa. Party at my place tonight, boys.

926
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:33,800
- Hello!
- Hey!

927
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,200
Fuck. I need to piss.

928
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,500
Thanks, mate.

929
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:39,500
We really needed to know that.

930
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,200
Bethie, you awake?

931
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,400
Come party with us.

932
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,300
No.

933
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,900
No more, Jake.

934
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:08,800
I could tell straightaway

935
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,200
it was a holding.

936
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,700
What's more, it's
my mate's holding.

937
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,000
Next thing I know,
I give him a smack.

938
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,700
Oh, if it isn't Gracie.

939
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,800
Hu wanted some water.

940
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:21,700
Come and give your uncle a kiss.

941
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,400
You're growing up fast, girl.

942
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:31,400
Where's mum?

943
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,400
She's in bed, where you should be.

944
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,200
What happened then, Jake?

945
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,300
He comes back at me
with this crowbar.

946
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:36,400
Yeah? And then what?

947
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,100
I take the crowbar off him

948
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,900
and give him another smack.

949
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,100
Good night, Hu.

950
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:43,700
Night-night.

951
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,700
Shh. Shh. It's OK, Gracie.

952
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,100
Uncle Bully is going
to be gentle with you...

953
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:24,500
as gentle as a lamb.

954
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:27,600
Shh.

955
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,000
Shh. Shh.

956
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:35,400
Your mum and dad are going to be

957
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,700
real angry at you,

958
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,500
turning me on like that...

959
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,500
coming downstairs in nothing

960
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:42,400
but that flimsy little nightie.

961
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,700
Shh, shh, shh.

962
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:47,600
It's our secret, hey, Gracie?

963
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:50,900
You hear me, girl?

964
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,600
Keep your mouth shut.

965
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,800
Did Huata wet the bed again, Bub?

966
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,300
You should have left it.
I'd have done that.

967
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:47,200
Just go away.

968
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,600
Go away.

969
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:50,200
Look, I don't blame you, Grace.

970
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:51,800
I wanted to see Boogie

971
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,100
as much as you.

972
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,400
You don't care about any of us.

973
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,500
That's not true.
I love you all.

974
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,900
But you're a liar!

975
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,900
Go on...

976
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,700
got your period, Bub.

977
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,100
It's bound to make you
a bit uptight...

978
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:10,100
Get out! Get out!

979
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,500
What's for breakfast?

980
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,000
You want something to eat,

981
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,800
fix it yourself.

982
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,300
Give me a coffee.

983
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:38,200
Go and have a wash, Jake.

984
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:41,000
Clean your ears out
while you're at it.

985
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:44,800
What the fuck's up with you?

986
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,900
I'm not going to
take this anymore.

987
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,600
Do you hear me, Jake Heke?

988
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:51,700
No more.

989
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,800
We never got to see Boogie.

990
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:58,200
I don't want any more
of these drunken parties

991
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,400
or your bloody ugly
mongrel mates coming around.

992
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:03,000
It's no good...

993
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,100
no good for the kids,

994
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:08,700
especially now Grace is growing.

995
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:13,300
Who the fuck do you
think you are, eh?

996
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,000
Sitting there like
Lady Bloody Muck,

997
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,300
telling me in my own house

998
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,800
who I can and can't have here.

999
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,400
Well, I've asked
them back tonight,

1000
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,700
and you'd better be ready for it.

1001
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:27,200
Do you hear me?!

1002
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,600
Now, get off your fat ass

1003
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,900
and get busy.

1004
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:33,400
Oh, Grace!

1005
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,500
Leave that kid alone!
You know, that's your problem.

1006
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:35,600
You spoil the lot of them!

1007
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,400
No wonder they're all
so fucking screwed up!

1008
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,900
It's got nothing to do with you,

1009
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:40,800
eh, Jake Heke?

1010
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,700
You're such good father material!

1011
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:45,000
You chased Nig off!

1012
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
You couldn't give a damn
about Boogie!

1013
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:54,600
You're not gonna
hurt my babies anymore...

1014
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:58,600
not while I can do
something about it.

1015
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,200
Oh, you want something to eat?

1016
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:04,900
Learn how to cook.

1017
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:06,800
Grace!

1018
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,500
Grace!

1019
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,400
What's up?

1020
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,200
What?

1021
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,800
I said, what's up?

1022
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:31,400
How long have you
been sitting there?

1023
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,000
Why is everything so black, Toot?

1024
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,200
Don't know.

1025
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,200
Maybe 'cause we're all bloody Maoris.

1026
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,300
You got something...

1027
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:56,100
you got something to sniff?

1028
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:58,600
Yeah. A couple of old socks.

1029
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,500
What's going on, G?

1030
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,400
I thought you said
we were best friends.

1031
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,000
If you're too bloody mean,
just forget it.

1032
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,100
Hang on. Hang on.

1033
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:10,200
No glue, OK? OK?

1034
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,900
But I've got some dope.

1035
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:14,600
You want some of that?

1036
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:16,600
Ya.

1037
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,400
What's going on with you, Bub?

1038
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:34,600
What colors are you seeing now, G?

1039
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,000
Still all black?

1040
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Not an old black in sight.

1041
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:49,300
Notice how you never see black
in a rainbow, do you?

1042
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,000
Just bright colors.

1043
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,400
Must be their pot.

1044
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,200
You know, the pot at
the end of the thing.

1045
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:03,400
Oh, dumb.

1046
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:06,800
Pot... the end of the thing.

1047
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,800
You're shit!

1048
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,300
You're just like
everyone else around here.

1049
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:15,900
I'm... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

1050
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:17,000
You're just a stupid kid

1051
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,800
that lives in an old wreck of a car.

1052
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,900
G! G! Come back, G!

1053
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:28,100
G, come back! What did I do?

1054
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:29,600
Please, G!

1055
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,200
I'm sorry!

1056
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:34,600
Please.

1057
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:40,400
This is the day
that the Lord has made

1058
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,100
That the Lord has made

1059
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:44,100
We will rejoice

1060
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:47,400
We will rejoice and be glad in it

1061
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,000
And be glad in it

1062
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Whoa, for this is the day

1063
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,300
That the Lord has made

1064
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:56,800
We will rejoice and be glad in it

1065
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,200
This is the day, this is the day

1066
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:03,700
That the Lord has made

1067
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,500
This is the day
that the Lord has made

1068
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,400
That the Lord has made

1069
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,600
We will rejoice

1070
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,800
We will rejoice and be glad in it

1071
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,400
And be glad in it

1072
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,200
This is the day

1073
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,200
That the Lord has made

1074
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:24,300
We will rejoice and be glad in it

1075
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:27,900
This is the day, this is the day

1076
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:30,600
That the Lord has made

1077
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:06,800
Shit. It's nearly on empty.

1078
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:07,800
I've got money.

1079
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,000
Forget the money. It's just no good.

1080
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,700
We've been driving around for hours.

1081
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,900
When was the last time
you phoned home?

1082
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,800
Uh, about 9:00.

1083
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,800
Jeez. It's nearly 11:00.

1084
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,700
I've got those

1085
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:25,400
Lonely, lonely, lonely,
lonely blues

1086
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,800
Lonely, lonely, lonely,
lonely blues

1087
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,100
I've got those

1088
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:38,000
Lonely, lonely, lonely,
lonely blues

1089
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:41,800
Lonely, lonely blues

1090
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:47,600
Look what she done,
what she done, my baby

1091
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,000
- Bring your ass in here, girl!
- Look what she done...

1092
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,200
I said in here! Move!

1093
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Your mother's been out

1094
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,500
all day, half the fucking night!

1095
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,200
Now, where the fuck you been?

1096
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,600
Come on, bro, she's home now.

1097
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,600
Let the kid go to bed.

1098
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,800
Come on, Jake.

1099
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,100
Play the guitar, man.

1100
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,200
Go on. Piss off to bed.

1101
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,800
Hey, come on, give your Uncle Bully

1102
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:17,800
a kiss good night.

1103
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,600
I don't want to.

1104
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,800
What? I didn't hear you.

1105
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,400
I said I don't want to.

1106
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:24,300
What, you got
a hearing problem, girl?

1107
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:26,400
Hey, no. Leave it.

1108
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:29,900
Daddy, no!

1109
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:31,200
Daddy!

1110
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,200
I told you about this thing, eh?

1111
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,900
No fucking wonder you don't do
what you're fucking told!

1112
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:37,600
Take it easy, Jake.

1113
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,400
She's just a kid.

1114
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:44,400
Fuck! Get out of here!

1115
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,300
Bully, play us a song.

1116
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,500
Go on, dude.

1117
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,800
Look what she done,
what she done, my baby

1118
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,100
Look what she done,
what she done, my baby

1119
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,000
Look what she done...

1120
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,400
Where is she?

1121
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:21,000
Stop your panic, woman.

1122
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
She's home.

1123
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,200
She won't be taking off anymore.

1124
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,600
Where is she, Jake?

1125
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:28,600
She pissed off out the back.

1126
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
What the fuck?

1127
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:43,100
Aah! Aah! Oh! Oh!

1128
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:48,300
Some-someone help me
get her down!

1129
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,400
Please! Please!

1130
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,200
Come on, baby. Come on, girl.

1131
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,900
It's all right, baby.

1132
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:01,100
Mummy's home. Mummy's home.

1133
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:04,300
Come on, Grace. Oh, God.

1134
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,800
We've got to do something.

1135
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:12,400
Jake!

1136
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,600
My baby!

1137
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:21,800
I'll get help.

1138
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:37,300
No, Grace!

1139
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,800
Don't cry, Mavis.

1140
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,800
Doesn't do any good.

1141
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,500
Auntie Matawai?

1142
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:07,800
It's Beth.

1143
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:16,200
Ka mata oku tamahine...

1144
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:21,400
last night.

1145
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:27,800
I want to bring her home, Auntie.

1146
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:34,000
Will you come and get us, please?

1147
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,500
Thank you.

1148
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:42,000
We're going to play spacies.

1149
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,400
Come on, you two.

1150
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,400
Oh, where's Gracie?

1151
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,000
She's having a long sleep.

1152
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,200
No, she's not. Her bed's empty.

1153
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:51,400
That's enough, Polly. Come on.

1154
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,400
What the fuck's going on here?

1155
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,400
I want us to take Grace back home

1156
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,400
to the Marae.

1157
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:08,000
This is her fucking home.

1158
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,400
No, it's not.

1159
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:12,200
This was never her home...

1160
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,800
never.

1161
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,900
And that fucking place is?

1162
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:18,100
Fucking Maoris who think they're better

1163
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:21,100
than the rest of us?

1164
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:23,200
I hate them.

1165
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,100
Bastards living in the fucking past.

1166
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:28,400
It's our past, too, Jake.

1167
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,000
What's that supposed to mean?

1168
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,900
I want Grace to be with her people.

1169
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,400
We should have gone back
a long time ago.

1170
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,400
Fuck off!

1171
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:40,800
You're not taking her anywhere.

1172
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:44,600
I'm taking her, Jake,
with or without you.

1173
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:48,000
I wasn't there
when Grace needed me.

1174
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
This time I'm going to do

1175
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,600
the right thing by her,

1176
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,000
and you're not going to stop me.

1177
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:54,100
You fucking do,

1178
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:55,900
and I won't be here
when you get back.

1179
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:57,400
Well, go on, then.

1180
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:00,100
Go! Get the hell out of here!

1181
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:02,200
I'm taking her.

1182
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:05,600
I'll kill you first!

1183
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,200
Well, go on. Do it.

1184
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,400
You're still a slave, Jake...

1185
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:16,400
to your fists, to the drink,

1186
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,400
to yourself.

1187
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:20,600
Well, go on.

1188
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,400
Kill the bloody lot of us!

1189
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,300
Stay out of my fucking way...

1190
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,500
or I'll kill you.

1191
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:21,700
You've come home, Grace.
We're home.

1192
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,600
Oh, my baby.

1193
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,900
Am I that much of a bastard, eh?

1194
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,400
You're my mates. You tell me.

1195
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,800
It's not too late
if you want to go to the Tangi.

1196
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,200
We'll drive you.

1197
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,900
Fuck off.

1198
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:16,000
I'm not going to give them
the satisfaction.

1199
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:19,000
I was never fucking good enough,

1200
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,900
not for their Beth.

1201
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,800
I'll knock her bloody head in.

1202
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:25,800
Never mind, bro.

1203
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:28,800
What's the key to her, man?

1204
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:31,100
You think I was tough on the kid?

1205
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:33,600
Na... it wouldn't have been
just that, mate.

1206
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:35,900
Bull, what do you think?

1207
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:37,900
You think I was tough on her?

1208
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:40,300
Fucked if I know, bro.

1209
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,900
I'll try and tell you
a story, eh, Gracie?

1210
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:48,400
The story about a young girl

1211
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:52,200
growing up in this beautiful place.

1212
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:55,600
She was given an honor.

1213
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:59,700
She was made Puhi of the Marae.

1214
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:01,700
The special one.

1215
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,600
Well, you see, the girl fell in love,

1216
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:11,600
as all young people do.

1217
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,400
But you see, the problem was...

1218
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:20,500
the old people
wouldn't agree to the fella.

1219
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,800
The girl, being headstrong,

1220
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,400
went with him anyway.

1221
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:33,100
Her father said she'd be back...

1222
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:36,800
that when everything
went to hell, she'd be back.

1223
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:41,200
So the girl...
made a promise to herself

1224
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:45,700
and said she wouldn't.

1225
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:49,600
No matter what, she wouldn't.

1226
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:52,600
You see, Grace...

1227
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:57,700
I did know how to keep a promise.

1228
01:21:57,700 --> 01:21:59,600
I did.

1229
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:03,100
I'm so sorry, Bub.

1230
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:05,300
I'm so sorry.

1231
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:10,300
I should have been
there for you, sis.

1232
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:16,200
You were always there for us.

1233
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,200
Oh, son.

1234
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,300
Hey, G.

1235
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:42,600
Best friends... forever.

1236
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,100
Remember?

1237
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:54,500
That's all I meant. Honest.

1238
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,400
But you were right.

1239
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,500
I'm just a stupid kid

1240
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:01,200
who lives in an old wreck of a car.

1241
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:05,400
She loved you, man.

1242
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,500
She loved you.

1243
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:11,700
What's the time?

1244
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:14,000
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

1245
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,600
What's the time? Say, it's 1:00

1246
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:19,400
Have you ever seen so much piss?

1247
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:21,500
That's because they love you, man.

1248
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:22,200
Yeah.

1249
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:25,500
Yeah. Why not?

1250
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,500
I'm a lovable chap.

1251
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,900
Jake the Muss.

1252
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:33,000
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

1253
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,400
Ohh ohh

1254
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:37,200
There's Mr. Daddy-Longlegs

1255
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:39,800
Crawling onto the ceiling

1256
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:42,200
The sun don't shine,
the sun don't shine

1257
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:45,100
The sun don't shine...

1258
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:08,200
Where the fuck are you?!

1259
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:47,800
You bastard!

1260
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,000
Fucking bastard.

1261
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,600
Don't forget your hat, eh, uncle?

1262
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,900
Hey, uncle, did you
get all the ghosts?

1263
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:03,200
I sure did.

1264
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,900
Got the whole lot of them.

1265
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:28,000
You come and stay.
Bring the kids with you.

1266
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,100
We've got a lot of work
to do back home.

1267
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,900
And here, too, auntie.

1268
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:34,900
You sort out here first.

1269
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:48,700
Be strong.

1270
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:53,300
Good-bye, auntie.

1271
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:06,900
You made me real proud today, son.

1272
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:10,200
Me, too, eh, Mum?
I made you proud today.

1273
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:13,000
You sure did, Bub.

1274
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:17,200
Well, I suppose I'd better
be taking off, then.

1275
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,300
Take off? Where to?

1276
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:21,900
I don't know.
Probably back to my car.

1277
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:23,100
I like it there.

1278
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:26,900
Well, do you think
you could like it here, with us?

1279
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,600
Because we like having you.

1280
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,700
Don't we, kids?

1281
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:31,800
Ya!

1282
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:35,500
Well, whatever you say, Mrs. H.

1283
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:38,500
I mean, if you need me,
that'll be great.

1284
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:40,300
I do need you.

1285
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:42,200
Need you all.

1286
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:59,100
Well, we'll say grace.

1287
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:01,500
Grace!

1288
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,500
Thank you for my family,

1289
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:14,200
and thank you for the food. Amen.

1290
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,600
Good look, bro.

1291
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,400
Would you like one, bro?

1292
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:32,900
No, thanks, man.
I wear mine on the inside.

1293
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:45,200
Don't you think you should
take the car back, son?

1294
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,200
In the morning.

1295
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Your mates did you proud today.

1296
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:55,800
There.

1297
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,300
Mrs. H, could you read me
one of G's stories?

1298
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:00,400
I can't. That's why she reads to me.

1299
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:01,600
I mean used to.

1300
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,200
Yeah, the one about the Taniwha.

1301
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:04,500
OK.

1302
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:41,600
What's wrong, Mum?

1303
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:46,000
Toot, put the kids in the car.

1304
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,600
Thanks, bro.

1305
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:54,900
Same place... same fucking place
same thing happed with me.

1306
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:57,500
Anyway, this fucking ape
comes over to me,

1307
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:00,600
takes off his shades,
and says the classic line.

1308
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,700
The classic line! Wait for it.

1309
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:04,900
Waiting, waiting, waiting.

1310
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:07,700
"What the fuck you staring at, man?"

1311
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:10,300
So I say to him, cool-ass,

1312
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:13,000
"Well, not you, mate.
Your spunky missis. "

1313
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:16,200
Trouble is, she was
fucking uglier than him.

1314
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:20,500
- Then all hell broke loose.
- Old Jimmy, eh?

1315
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:24,300
Hey, you can stay at
my place tonight, mate.

1316
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:26,900
Yeah, fuck it. Why not?

1317
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:31,100
Beth! Bully, give the lady a seat.

1318
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,300
You fucking animal.

1319
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:35,700
What the fuck?

1320
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:38,500
Women and children, eh?
You fucking coward!

1321
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:41,900
Please, control your
missis there, mate.

1322
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:43,300
Who the fuck do you think you are

1323
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:45,300
coming in here
mouthing off at my mates?

1324
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:46,500
Get the fucking hell out of here

1325
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:48,000
before I kick your bloody head in.

1326
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,900
That's always your
answer, eh, Jake?

1327
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:51,200
Violence.

1328
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:53,800
It's bad enough that you did it here,

1329
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:55,100
but you brought it home with you

1330
01:30:55,100 --> 01:30:56,900
and I damn well let you.

1331
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:59,400
What the fuck are you on about now?

1332
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:01,900
It was violence
that killed my Grace.

1333
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:04,400
She didn't have an ounce
of violence in her, Jake,

1334
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:06,500
but we made damn sure
it was all around her.

1335
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:07,800
She killed herself!

1336
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:09,000
You bloody bastard!

1337
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,200
It was your bloody mate

1338
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:12,700
who handed her the rope!

1339
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:14,800
Hey, I don't have a clue
what you're on about.

1340
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:17,300
- You fucking child...
- Shut up, Nig!

1341
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:19,200
You animal.

1342
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,600
You raped a 13-year-old girl,

1343
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,500
then sat here drinking
with her father

1344
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,300
while the rest of us buried her.

1345
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:26,900
She's off her fucking head, man.

1346
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:28,200
Sneaking around my house

1347
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:29,800
and laying your dirty, filthy,

1348
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:32,500
fucking hands on my baby!

1349
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:33,400
My Grace!

1350
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,800
Hey, you're not
on the fucking Marae now,

1351
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:38,000
so don't come in here
accusing my mates of shit!

1352
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,200
Hey, come on, man.

1353
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,600
Look, no one's thinking straight.

1354
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,900
We're family. Right?

1355
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:47,000
Beth. Sit down. Have a drink.

1356
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,900
I won't drink with
you fucking animals!

1357
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:55,500
Read it.

1358
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:14,000
Uncle Bully.

1359
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:24,600
Uncle fucking Bully!

1360
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:04,700
Let's go, son.

1361
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:09,900
You dumb bastard, Bully!

1362
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:24,100
Fuck you, Beth. Where are you going?

1363
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:32,000
I found something better, Jake,

1364
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,100
and I'm going to make damn sure
my kids have it all.

1365
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:36,600
From now on,

1366
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,800
I make the decisions for my family.

1367
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,200
Fuck off, then!

1368
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:45,000
You'll get nothing from me.

1369
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,500
You've got nothing I want.

1370
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:50,400
Our people once were warriors,

1371
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:53,300
but not like you, Jake.

1372
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:57,000
They were a people
with mana, pride.

1373
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,400
People with spirit.

1374
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:01,800
If my spirit can survive

1375
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:04,000
living with you for 18 years,

1376
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,600
then I can survive anything.

1377
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,200
Maybe you taught me that.

1378
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,900
Oh, you are fucked, lady!
Really fucked!

1379
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:18,000
You think I need you
and your fucking spirit?

1380
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,800
Fuck off! Go on, go!

1381
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,600
I don't want you, ever!

1382
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,800
I'll knock your fucking head off!

1383
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:28,500
Fuck you! You'll be back.

1384
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:30,200
Fuck this warrior shit.

1385
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:32,400
You'll be back!

1386
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:33,900
Fuck you, Beth!

1387
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:35,900
Do you hear me, Beth?!

1388
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:39,400
Fuck you!

1389
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:44,600
Where are we going, Mum?

1390
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:47,900
We're going home.

1391
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,100
Oh, fuck all that
fucking warrior shit!

1392
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:56,000
You'll be back! You'll fucking see.

1393
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,800
You'll need me!
You'll fucking want me!

1394
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,800
You'll be back. Fuck you, Beth!
