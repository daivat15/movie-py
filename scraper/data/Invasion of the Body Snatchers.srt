1
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,510
There's some more flowers, kids.
Go pick 'em.

2
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,680
Yeah!

3
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:02,559
That's a pretty one!

4
00:05:03,619 --> 00:05:07,559
- I don't have one.
- Well, go look for one, over there.

5
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:11,318
Oh, that's beautiful. Let me look at that.

6
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,488
Let me look at that!

7
00:05:14,838 --> 00:05:19,078
Now you can take them home
to your parents. Don't they smell nice!

8
00:05:25,257 --> 00:05:26,877
Hi.

9
00:05:33,186 --> 00:05:36,676
Too much trouble to pick the mail up
off the floor, Geoffrey?

10
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:41,096
Hello?

11
00:05:44,695 --> 00:05:46,725
Look at this flower.

12
00:05:52,455 --> 00:05:54,484
All right! Attaway!

13
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:01,824
You know, I think I actually
found something rare.

14
00:06:02,914 --> 00:06:04,284
What?

15
00:06:04,424 --> 00:06:07,783
- This plant. I think it's a grex.
- A what?

16
00:06:07,923 --> 00:06:11,783
G-R-E-X. That's when
two species cross-pollinate

17
00:06:11,923 --> 00:06:14,793
and produce a third
completely unique one.

18
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:16,922
And listen to this:

19
00:06:17,052 --> 00:06:23,842
"Epilobic, from the Greek epi: upon,
and lobos: a pod."

20
00:06:24,102 --> 00:06:28,041
"Many of the species are dangerous
weeds and should be avoided."

21
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:29,461
Dangerous?

22
00:06:29,611 --> 00:06:31,641
In the garden.

23
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:35,151
See? Look how quickly it roots.

24
00:06:35,281 --> 00:06:38,770
"Their rapid and widespread growth
was even observed

25
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,740
in many of the war-torn cities of Europe."

26
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,860
"lndeed, some of these plants
may thrive on devastated ground."

27
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,689
Why don't we go up to Vail
for the weekend? Fly up Friday, hm?

28
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,699
OK, maybe. Sure.

29
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:55,119
Geoffrey! I'm trying to read!

30
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:56,919
You're in a good mood.

31
00:06:57,049 --> 00:07:00,458
Well, I got something
to look forward to tonight - playoffs.

32
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:02,508
Geoffrey.

33
00:07:02,638 --> 00:07:05,508
- What?
- I'm reading.

34
00:07:05,888 --> 00:07:09,048
OK! I'll put the earphones on.
There, see? Happy?

35
00:07:09,188 --> 00:07:11,587
Never mind. I'll go downstairs.

36
00:07:16,107 --> 00:07:18,677
Comment? Qui est là?
Who is it?

37
00:07:18,817 --> 00:07:20,857
Department of Health.

38
00:07:24,906 --> 00:07:27,986
Bonsoir, Monsieur Bennell.
How nice to see you.

39
00:07:49,514 --> 00:07:51,544
What is that supposed to be?

40
00:07:51,684 --> 00:07:54,423
It is cervelles en matelote.

41
00:07:54,563 --> 00:07:57,593
In English, what would I be eating
if I ate that?

42
00:07:57,733 --> 00:08:01,893
- Ah. Calves' brains in red wine.
- Red wine and what else?

43
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:06,852
Mais, c'est impossible. It's impossible.
It's a secret, Mr Bennell.

44
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:11,152
You don't have any secrets
from the Department of Health, Henri.

45
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,402
A good young Burgundy, brown stock,

46
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:17,491
thyme, parsley - just a sprig.

47
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:21,831
Capers,... a fresh bay leaf, and garlic.

48
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:25,291
- That's all?
- Oui. Yes.

49
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,670
- What is that?
- A caper.

50
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:38,879
No.

51
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,639
Do you presume to tell us
what is in this stock?

52
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:44,469
- It's a rat turd.
- A what?

53
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:46,639
A rat turd.

54
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:49,188
- A caper!
- A rat turd.

55
00:08:50,408 --> 00:08:51,728
A caper!

56
00:08:52,778 --> 00:08:54,818
If it's a caper,

57
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:56,988
eat it.

58
00:09:03,037 --> 00:09:06,577
I'm gonna bring you up
for permit revocation, Henri.

59
00:09:06,707 --> 00:09:11,116
You're charging way too much
to be serving crap like that in here.

60
00:09:11,256 --> 00:09:15,376
But, Monsieur, it is an accident.
You know how careful we are.

61
00:10:10,231 --> 00:10:11,221
Hello?

62
00:10:11,351 --> 00:10:12,931
- Elizabeth?
- Yes.

63
00:10:13,061 --> 00:10:14,721
- Wake you up?
- No. Hi, Matthew.

64
00:10:14,861 --> 00:10:17,220
- They busted the window of my car.
- Oh, no!

65
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,600
Threw a bottle of wine at it -
not even good wine.

66
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,770
The Warriors won,
so I guess your household's happy.

67
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,310
Yes.

68
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,609
- What are you doing?
- Oh, nothing.

69
00:10:27,739 --> 00:10:30,279
If you go to sleep now,
you can get up early.

70
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:31,739
Oh, Matthew...

71
00:10:31,869 --> 00:10:36,029
If you can come in at 7.30,
you can run the tests before 8 o'clock.

72
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:40,288
Stop! Matthew... stop.
I'm not coming in before 8 o'clock

73
00:10:40,418 --> 00:10:44,168
- in the morning!
- I gotta force the abatement hearing.

74
00:10:44,298 --> 00:10:47,458
- Wednesday's their only free slot.
- No, Matthew!

75
00:10:47,598 --> 00:10:49,547
I will not be there before eight!

76
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:52,797
I nominated you for
Civil Servant ofthe Year award.

77
00:10:52,927 --> 00:10:54,967
It's true. I think you'll win.

78
00:10:55,097 --> 00:11:00,166
OK, OK, OK. I'll be in at 7.30.
I'll run a salmonella test for you.

79
00:11:00,316 --> 00:11:02,386
Thank you. See you in the morning.

80
00:11:02,526 --> 00:11:04,726
Good night. I'll see you in the morning.

81
00:11:04,856 --> 00:11:06,976
- Bye.
- Bye.

82
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:41,357
Geoffrey, my God!
How long have you been up?

83
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:43,527
Not long.

84
00:12:44,447 --> 00:12:46,737
What are you doing?

85
00:12:47,657 --> 00:12:49,696
Geoffrey?

86
00:14:47,436 --> 00:14:51,675
I wanna throw the book at him. Those
scallops are just cut-up pieces of skate.

87
00:14:51,815 --> 00:14:54,555
I'm sorry. I can start the tests right away.

88
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:57,565
It's OK...
And something's wrong with the potato.

89
00:14:57,695 --> 00:15:00,774
Either the sour cream is phoney,
or the chives.

90
00:15:00,904 --> 00:15:03,354
I'm sorry. I got up on time.
It was Geoffrey.

91
00:15:03,494 --> 00:15:08,364
- What did the mad dentist do this time?
- I don't know. He was just weird.

92
00:15:08,494 --> 00:15:11,033
He's crazy. All dentists are crazy.

93
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:14,033
- Are you late?
- No.

94
00:15:14,753 --> 00:15:17,283
He was weird not the way he usually is.

95
00:15:17,423 --> 00:15:19,903
That can only be an improvement.

96
00:15:22,302 --> 00:15:25,002
Well, it's not. It's got me really nervous.

97
00:15:25,142 --> 00:15:27,172
Tell him to shape up or get out.

98
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:30,342
- It's his house.
- Make him an offer.

99
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:33,511
- Here's something that'll cheer you up.
- What?

100
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,641
Ever seen one of these up close?

101
00:15:35,771 --> 00:15:37,931
- What is it?
- What does it look like?

102
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,561
- A caper?
- A caper?

103
00:15:39,691 --> 00:15:40,851
What is it?

104
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:44,060
- A rat turd, but the sauce was delicious.
- I got you a rat.

105
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,230
- Did you find one?
- I've got it. It was a biggie.

106
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,650
OK, we'll get a declaration
of "unsanitary" on him.

107
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,530
- I'll talk to you later, OK?
- OK.

108
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,949
- What can I do?
- Nothing. Don't worry. Go on.

109
00:15:57,079 --> 00:15:59,119
I'm sorry.

110
00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:01,619
Oh, I'm sorry.

111
00:16:16,397 --> 00:16:20,967
- Hey, come on. Tell me what I've done.
- I understand today's plan.

112
00:16:21,107 --> 00:16:24,517
Something's come up, Elizabeth.
I have to go back out again.

113
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:26,687
Now? Weren't we going to the game?

114
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:29,186
The Warriors.
I gave the tickets to a patient.

115
00:16:29,316 --> 00:16:31,686
You're not gonna see tonight's game?

116
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:33,356
No choice.

117
00:16:33,496 --> 00:16:36,196
Geoffrey, what is the matter with you?

118
00:16:36,326 --> 00:16:38,775
I'm fine. I just have to go to a meeting.

119
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,155
Meeting? What kind of a meeting?

120
00:16:41,295 --> 00:16:45,285
Elizabeth, I don't think
I have to justify my every move to you.

121
00:16:46,165 --> 00:16:48,205
Geoffrey, this isn't like you.

122
00:16:48,585 --> 00:16:51,994
Please, come on. I just want it to be nice...

123
00:16:53,594 --> 00:16:56,074
Elizabeth, what's the matter with you?

124
00:16:56,264 --> 00:16:58,294
Nothing.

125
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,540
Come in!

126
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,370
Hi.

127
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,040
How you doing?

128
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:53,299
Is it true that if you think
you're losing your mind, you're not?

129
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,138
Well, I hope so.

130
00:18:00,408 --> 00:18:02,518
I know this is gonna sound insane.

131
00:18:02,658 --> 00:18:04,268
What?

132
00:18:05,787 --> 00:18:09,107
Geoffrey is not Geoffrey.

133
00:18:10,247 --> 00:18:12,647
- How do you know?
- I know.

134
00:18:13,787 --> 00:18:16,866
On the outside Geoffrey is still Geoffrey,

135
00:18:17,006 --> 00:18:20,286
but on the inside
I can tell there is something different.

136
00:18:20,426 --> 00:18:22,246
Something is missing.

137
00:18:22,386 --> 00:18:25,416
- What?
- Emotion, feelings.

138
00:18:25,716 --> 00:18:27,755
He's just not the same person.

139
00:18:31,185 --> 00:18:34,345
Really, you know what I mean?
I know it sounds crazy.

140
00:18:34,475 --> 00:18:37,965
Yeah. I know what you mean, I think.
Have you eaten?

141
00:18:38,105 --> 00:18:40,344
- I'm not hungry.
- Have some celery.

142
00:18:40,484 --> 00:18:42,344
- I'm not...
- Eat, eat, eat.

143
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:47,774
We can eat outside. It's a beautiful night.

144
00:18:49,653 --> 00:18:52,323
Take that meat there, will you?
Chop it up.

145
00:18:52,453 --> 00:18:55,733
And hand me the ginger,
the stuff that's chopped up there.

146
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:09,202
You wanna know something else?
This is really weird.

147
00:19:12,341 --> 00:19:15,791
I went to see his sister Nora
to talk to her about it.

148
00:19:17,181 --> 00:19:19,511
But I couldn't. I stopped myself.

149
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:21,471
She changed, too?

150
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,430
- Do you think I'm crazy?
- No.

151
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,770
D'you wanna go see
my friend David Kibner?

152
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,350
- The psychiatrist?
- Not like that.

153
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:35,109
Talk to him. He would
put things into perspective.

154
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:39,069
- I'm not crazy.
- No, no, no. I'm serious.

155
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:44,238
He would eliminate whether Geoffrey
was having an affair, or had become gay.

156
00:19:44,368 --> 00:19:49,238
Whether he had a social disease,
or had become a Republican.

157
00:19:49,378 --> 00:19:53,708
All the things that could have happened
to have made you feel he had changed.

158
00:19:53,838 --> 00:19:56,787
D'you know what I mean?
You wanna go see him?

159
00:19:59,007 --> 00:20:00,837
You think I'm nuts.

160
00:20:02,017 --> 00:20:04,757
No, I don't.
Can you still do the thing with your eyes?

161
00:20:06,476 --> 00:20:09,926
If you're not crazy,
you can do that thing with your eyes.

162
00:20:19,525 --> 00:20:21,105
You're not crazy.

163
00:20:21,245 --> 00:20:23,275
This is delicious.

164
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:25,315
You're a great cook.

165
00:20:25,455 --> 00:20:27,694
What time is Geoffrey getting back?

166
00:20:29,374 --> 00:20:31,404
He said not to wait up for him.

167
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,824
D'you want some more wine?

168
00:21:03,031 --> 00:21:05,271
- Morning!
- Hello.

169
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:09,651
One, two... Mrs Teng,
this one's got a coffee stain on it.

170
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,690
Here.

171
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:16,600
- That's not coffee.
- That is coffee. I put it there myself.

172
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,870
Maybe not come out.

173
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:24,749
You doctor, right?

174
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:27,619
Me? No. Health Department. Civil servant.

175
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:32,709
Do you need a doctor?

176
00:21:32,849 --> 00:21:34,958
My wife... sick.

177
00:21:35,098 --> 00:21:38,878
- What's wrong with her?
- She wrong.

178
00:21:40,018 --> 00:21:43,308
- She's not right?
- That not my wife.

179
00:21:43,648 --> 00:21:45,677
You mean, she's...?

180
00:21:46,147 --> 00:21:48,187
No, no. Different.

181
00:21:52,617 --> 00:21:54,647
That not my wife!

182
00:22:23,014 --> 00:22:25,054
How you doin', Harry?

183
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:27,264
Hey, pooch. How you doin', boy?

184
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:16,089
Where you been? You've been driving me
crazy. I've been looking all over for you.

185
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:17,769
What's the matter with you?

186
00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:20,599
You all right?

187
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,278
Talk to me, Elizabeth.

188
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:03,515
I keep seeing these people

189
00:24:04,315 --> 00:24:06,354
all recognising each other.

190
00:24:06,484 --> 00:24:09,024
Something was passing between them all.

191
00:24:09,154 --> 00:24:11,184
Some secret.

192
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:16,733
It's a conspiracy. I know it.

193
00:24:17,413 --> 00:24:19,573
There can't be a conspiracy.

194
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:22,823
Matthew, I'm telling you,
something's going on here.

195
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:24,993
Something that scares me.

196
00:24:25,133 --> 00:24:27,692
I tried to see Geoffrey today,
to talk to him.

197
00:24:27,882 --> 00:24:30,442
He's always in his office in the morning.

198
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:13,828
It really was weird.

199
00:25:13,968 --> 00:25:16,668
Geoffrey was meeting
all sorts ofstrange people.

200
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:18,958
Things were being passed between them.

201
00:25:19,098 --> 00:25:22,008
- None were people you knew?
- I didn't know any of them.

202
00:25:22,138 --> 00:25:24,707
Maybe they were patients of Geoffrey's.

203
00:25:24,847 --> 00:25:27,757
Oh, no, no, Matthew. I know they weren't.

204
00:25:27,897 --> 00:25:30,807
I followed him
from one end oftown to the other,

205
00:25:30,937 --> 00:25:35,306
and everywhere he went he had
these meetings with strange people.

206
00:25:47,035 --> 00:25:50,075
I felt so stupid
sneaking around spying on him,

207
00:25:50,205 --> 00:25:53,035
but I can't talk to him. What can I do?

208
00:25:56,504 --> 00:26:00,164
OK. Well, Kibner will be able
to explain something.

209
00:26:00,294 --> 00:26:02,454
I don't need a psychiatrist.

210
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,964
Just forget that he's a psychiatrist.

211
00:26:05,094 --> 00:26:08,293
Just think of him as an intelligent man,
which is what he is.

212
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:12,053
It's a book party. He's a celebrity.
He's very famous.

213
00:26:12,183 --> 00:26:15,513
And you will like him,
if you forget that he's a psychiatrist.

214
00:26:16,353 --> 00:26:18,592
I don't know... I don't know.

215
00:26:18,732 --> 00:26:21,512
Matthew, I've lived in this city all my life,

216
00:26:21,652 --> 00:26:25,232
but somehow today
I felt everything had changed.

217
00:26:25,362 --> 00:26:28,561
People were different.
Notjust Geoffrey, but everybody.

218
00:26:28,701 --> 00:26:31,691
Yesterday it all seemed normal.

219
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:35,321
Today everything seemed the same,
but it wasn't.

220
00:26:35,451 --> 00:26:37,491
It was a nightmare.

221
00:26:38,371 --> 00:26:40,410
It really became frightening.

222
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,660
It was like the whole city
had changed overnight.

223
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:02,678
Did I ever tell you the one
about the English Camel Corps? Did l?

224
00:27:04,018 --> 00:27:07,178
They're trapped in the desert,
in the Sahara desert.

225
00:27:08,648 --> 00:27:12,767
They've been surrounded by Rommel
for 40 days and they've run out of food.

226
00:27:12,907 --> 00:27:17,237
And the captain comes
and makes an announcement to the men.

227
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:18,987
He says,

228
00:27:19,117 --> 00:27:23,906
"Men, I have some good news
and some bad news for you."

229
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:26,866
- One of the men says...
- Wait. You have told me this.

230
00:27:31,006 --> 00:27:33,206
Can I tell it to you again?

231
00:27:34,095 --> 00:27:35,335
Look out!

232
00:27:35,465 --> 00:27:37,125
Oh, my God! Lock the door!

233
00:27:37,265 --> 00:27:39,295
- They're coming!
- We should help.

234
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:42,465
Help! Help! They're coming.
They're coming. Listen!

235
00:27:42,595 --> 00:27:45,214
- He's smashed out of his skull.
- He's terrified.

236
00:27:45,354 --> 00:27:48,594
You're next. Please! Please!
You're next. We're in danger!

237
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:50,634
Listen to me... Something terrible!

238
00:27:50,774 --> 00:27:53,974
Please. You're next!
Here they are. They're already here!

239
00:27:54,114 --> 00:27:55,603
Help! You're next!

240
00:27:55,733 --> 00:27:59,673
- They're coming. They're coming...
- He must have done something.

241
00:28:04,743 --> 00:28:07,222
The policeman'll help.

242
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,350
Oh, my God.

243
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:39,469
That poor man.
What was he talking about?

244
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:43,019
I'll phone a witness report in
from the bookstore.

245
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,569
Matthew, thank God you're here!
These people are driving me nuts.

246
00:28:47,699 --> 00:28:49,778
- Are we gonna have dinner?
- No, I can't.

247
00:28:49,908 --> 00:28:51,988
- Is there a phone?
- Around the corner.

248
00:28:52,118 --> 00:28:55,868
- Elizabeth Driscoll, Jack Bellicec.
- This is the Elizabeth?

249
00:28:55,998 --> 00:28:58,328
The book is awful. Kibner's book is awful.

250
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:01,077
His ideas are garbage. Pure garbage.

251
00:29:01,217 --> 00:29:03,997
How can you say that
about a man like Kibner?

252
00:29:04,127 --> 00:29:06,877
Not a man like Kibner.
I'm saying it about Kibner.

253
00:29:07,007 --> 00:29:11,207
He dashes a book off every six months.
Takes me six months to write one line.

254
00:29:11,347 --> 00:29:14,126
- Why?
- Cos I pick each word individually.

255
00:29:14,266 --> 00:29:17,846
- What's so hot about that?
- I wasn't even talking to you, was l?

256
00:29:17,976 --> 00:29:20,376
On the corner of Leavenworth and...

257
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:22,515
- Turk.
- Turk? Turk.

258
00:29:22,945 --> 00:29:24,975
Is that him?

259
00:29:25,985 --> 00:29:27,395
Yes.

260
00:29:28,025 --> 00:29:29,055
Yes!

261
00:29:30,325 --> 00:29:34,314
"What's so hot about that?
What's so hot about that?" I don't know...

262
00:29:34,454 --> 00:29:38,224
You must have a report on it
cos there was a motorcycle officer there

263
00:29:38,374 --> 00:29:40,694
- and an ambulance on the way.
- They follow me.

264
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:44,403
- They don't understand me.
- You don't have to prove yourself to them.

265
00:29:44,543 --> 00:29:47,073
- That's easy for you to say.
- Of course I saw it.

266
00:29:47,213 --> 00:29:50,903
- The man was running down the street.
- It's romantic, sentimental,

267
00:29:51,053 --> 00:29:54,003
- He landed on my car.
- post-industrial nonsense.

268
00:29:54,133 --> 00:29:56,612
Just a second. I'm talking to the police.

269
00:29:56,762 --> 00:30:00,132
- No, he was bleeding on the road.
- What seems to be the trouble?

270
00:30:00,262 --> 00:30:01,452
Hello? Yeah.

271
00:30:01,602 --> 00:30:03,762
Don't ever give your name to cops.

272
00:30:03,892 --> 00:30:06,371
Leavenworth and Turk. I'll hold.

273
00:30:06,521 --> 00:30:08,681
But he isn't my husband!

274
00:30:08,811 --> 00:30:11,431
It's someone who looks like him.
He's an impostor!

275
00:30:11,571 --> 00:30:15,341
Now, Katherine, he's your husband.
You know him and I know him.

276
00:30:15,491 --> 00:30:20,230
I had to wait until today cos he has
a scar on the back of his neck

277
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:22,850
and when his hair is long
you can't see it.

278
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,450
- He went to have a haircut today...
- And the scar was gone.

279
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,489
No! It's still there!

280
00:30:29,629 --> 00:30:33,119
Of course it's still there.
What did you expect? He's still Ted.

281
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:37,459
- Excuse me, can I say one thing?
- Please! He's still your husband Ted.

282
00:30:37,589 --> 00:30:39,578
- I know something...
- Katherine?

283
00:30:39,718 --> 00:30:41,538
- Could I say one thing?
- Katherine!

284
00:30:41,678 --> 00:30:43,048
Just a minute.

285
00:30:43,178 --> 00:30:45,508
- Katherine.
- Just give me a minute, will you?

286
00:30:45,638 --> 00:30:47,798
Will you trust me?

287
00:30:47,938 --> 00:30:51,097
Will you please trust me? Will you?

288
00:30:51,227 --> 00:30:54,467
I work for the county.
This is a public-spirited gesture.

289
00:30:54,607 --> 00:30:58,097
- I will give you my name...
- Kibner wants people to fit the world.

290
00:30:58,237 --> 00:31:00,976
- I wanna report this.
- I want the world to fit people.

291
00:31:01,116 --> 00:31:04,436
- We'll talk about this later.
- Where's Homer? Or Kazantzakis?

292
00:31:04,576 --> 00:31:07,196
- Where's Jack London?
- Where's Elizabeth?

293
00:31:07,326 --> 00:31:10,566
- I'm afraid!
- I understand, I know.

294
00:31:10,706 --> 00:31:12,905
I understand. Let me have your hand.

295
00:31:13,045 --> 00:31:15,705
- Katherine, just trust me.
- Isn't he wonderful?

296
00:31:15,835 --> 00:31:17,705
Come on.

297
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:21,665
There. That's not so bad, is it?
Who's this behind me?

298
00:31:21,795 --> 00:31:24,164
- It's Ted.
- That's right.

299
00:31:24,304 --> 00:31:26,254
Hold on. Come on, just hold on.

300
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:30,244
Hold on. Just relax now.

301
00:31:30,394 --> 00:31:33,304
- You gonna be all right? You feel better?
- Yeah. Yes.

302
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:35,383
- You wanna go home now?
- Yes.

303
00:31:35,523 --> 00:31:38,473
- Will you come and see me tomorrow?
- Please... tomorrow.

304
00:31:38,603 --> 00:31:41,273
Tomorrow we'll all talk.
OK? The three of us?

305
00:31:41,403 --> 00:31:43,433
OK, but I better take her home.

306
00:31:43,573 --> 00:31:45,602
Yes. It's OK.

307
00:31:45,732 --> 00:31:47,772
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- OK.

308
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:50,272
- All right?
- OK.

309
00:31:55,991 --> 00:31:57,401
Thank you.

310
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,861
They don't wanna hear
about the accident.

311
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,821
It's a big conspiracy.

312
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,161
- What's a conspiracy?
- Everything.

313
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,620
Excuse me.

314
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,420
I understand what you're trying to say.

315
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,329
My name is Elizabeth Driscoll,
the Public Health Department. Call me.

316
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:20,509
Katherine! Come on, Katherine.

317
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:25,249
That woman's husband
is not her husband.

318
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:28,978
I saw him with Geoffrey. He's one of them.
She knows about it

319
00:32:29,108 --> 00:32:32,098
- and nobody's helping her.
- No. Somebody's helping her.

320
00:32:32,238 --> 00:32:34,438
I'm glad you heard that. David, Elizabeth.

321
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,728
I've heard it all week. It's popular.

322
00:32:36,868 --> 00:32:39,147
- What is?
- I was trying to tell you

323
00:32:39,287 --> 00:32:42,107
- that I also know somebody...
- Who's changed.

324
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,997
- Yes.
- Can we go outside and talk about it?

325
00:32:46,627 --> 00:32:51,966
Listen, there's a lady up top - red hair,
blue dress. She's interested in your work.

326
00:32:56,926 --> 00:33:00,666
I've heard the same damn story
this week from six patients.

327
00:33:00,806 --> 00:33:03,365
People are changing,
becoming less human.

328
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:05,545
It's happening all around us.

329
00:33:05,685 --> 00:33:07,925
That's not what we're talking about.

330
00:33:08,065 --> 00:33:10,595
This has nothing to do with
the man I live with.

331
00:33:10,735 --> 00:33:13,344
It has everything to do with it.
Don't you see?

332
00:33:13,484 --> 00:33:18,634
People step in and out of relationships
because they don't want responsibility.

333
00:33:18,784 --> 00:33:22,694
That's why marriages are going to hell.
The family unit is shot to hell.

334
00:33:22,823 --> 00:33:25,813
- David, you're not listening to her.
- Stay out of this!

335
00:33:25,953 --> 00:33:27,943
You see, that's the point.

336
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:30,643
I'm listening,
but he doesn't think I am. Why?

337
00:33:30,793 --> 00:33:34,482
Because he doesn't expect me
to bother enough, or to care.

338
00:33:34,632 --> 00:33:37,452
- Bellicec, for the last time, stop!
- Stop what?!

339
00:33:37,592 --> 00:33:40,332
- Stand still, be quiet, and shut up!
- Jack!

340
00:33:40,462 --> 00:33:41,832
How did you feel about that?

341
00:33:41,972 --> 00:33:43,542
Why in the store? He's a nut.

342
00:33:43,682 --> 00:33:44,861
How did you feel?

343
00:33:45,681 --> 00:33:47,711
You were probably shocked.

344
00:33:47,851 --> 00:33:50,331
You wanted to shut your feelings off,

345
00:33:50,471 --> 00:33:55,630
maybe make believe it wasn't happening
cos then you don't have to deal with it.

346
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:59,850
I wanna deal with that woman
in the bookstore.

347
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,020
Why?

348
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,600
Do you identify with her?

349
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,979
Yes.

350
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:09,819
OK.

351
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,819
Come on.

352
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:16,659
Suppose I were to tell you that Katherine
is trying to escape from a relationship.

353
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:19,658
- He's treating her.
- So why'd he push me against a wall?

354
00:34:19,798 --> 00:34:21,618
- She's upset.
- She looks fine.

355
00:34:21,758 --> 00:34:24,458
- She is upset, Jack.
- You look upset to me now.

356
00:34:24,588 --> 00:34:28,078
Do me a favour, will ya?
Go home and I'll call you later.

357
00:34:28,218 --> 00:34:30,787
- Go home and leave us alone for a bit.
- Go home?

358
00:34:30,927 --> 00:34:32,957
- OK?
- OK. OK.

359
00:34:33,097 --> 00:34:34,927
Thank you.

360
00:34:38,727 --> 00:34:41,056
You're jumping to a bizarre conclusion.

361
00:34:41,186 --> 00:34:44,596
That this man you live with
has been replaced by somebody else.

362
00:34:44,736 --> 00:34:47,806
Isn't it more likely
you want to believe he's changed

363
00:34:47,946 --> 00:34:51,685
because you're really looking
for an excuse to get out?

364
00:35:02,584 --> 00:35:04,074
I don't know.

365
00:35:04,204 --> 00:35:06,284
Will you think about it, please,

366
00:35:06,424 --> 00:35:08,454
before you make a move?

367
00:35:08,584 --> 00:35:12,283
Before you jump and
destroy something you have. Will you?

368
00:35:13,383 --> 00:35:15,413
Please?

369
00:35:19,973 --> 00:35:22,003
Yeah.

370
00:35:28,602 --> 00:35:30,182
Thank you.

371
00:35:30,312 --> 00:35:33,472
I just gave her
a psychological Band-Aid, Matthew.

372
00:35:33,612 --> 00:35:35,601
I should talk to her some more.

373
00:35:35,741 --> 00:35:38,771
You could bring her by my office
tomorrow around four.

374
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:40,811
What's the matter with her?

375
00:35:40,951 --> 00:35:44,691
It's like there's some kind of
hallucinatory flu going around.

376
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:48,570
People get over it in a day or two.
All I can do is treat the symptoms.

377
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,700
She's gonna be OK?

378
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:53,120
A good night's sleep wouldn't hurt.

379
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,540
- Is it contagious?
- Oh, Matthew!

380
00:35:56,629 --> 00:36:00,459
- Take her home to her boyfriend.
- That wasn't what I was thinking.

381
00:36:00,589 --> 00:36:03,999
I was just wondering
if the Health Department should look at it.

382
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:06,169
Who knows? I don't know.

383
00:36:06,848 --> 00:36:08,878
I wish I did.

384
00:36:09,848 --> 00:36:11,338
OK.

385
00:36:12,768 --> 00:36:14,808
Take her home, Matthew.

386
00:36:37,836 --> 00:36:40,865
Ah, Jack. How was the book party?

387
00:36:42,845 --> 00:36:44,875
Is that Kibner's new book?

388
00:36:48,555 --> 00:36:50,584
Didn't get to read your poetry?

389
00:36:51,934 --> 00:36:53,964
I'm sorry, Jack.

390
00:36:54,304 --> 00:36:56,344
Good evening. Bellicec Baths.

391
00:36:58,234 --> 00:37:02,593
Yes, we recommend the 1 5-minute soak
in Calistoga volcanic ash,

392
00:37:02,733 --> 00:37:06,013
that's followed by
an Aqua-Surge whirlpool dip.

393
00:37:22,792 --> 00:37:24,821
Hey, can you help me outta here?

394
00:37:27,301 --> 00:37:28,871
Bellicec!

395
00:37:29,011 --> 00:37:31,081
I'm talking to you. Give me a hand.

396
00:37:31,221 --> 00:37:33,251
Help me outta this thing.

397
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,170
Stan...

398
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,300
Every week we go through this.

399
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:43,370
- Why can't you be more cooperative?
- Get me a towel.

400
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,139
You are really gonna get hurt
one of these days.

401
00:37:46,269 --> 00:37:48,389
Give me another towel, would you?

402
00:37:48,529 --> 00:37:50,349
Come on.

403
00:38:02,748 --> 00:38:05,418
Nancy, shut the music off.

404
00:38:05,538 --> 00:38:07,617
It's for the plants, Stan.

405
00:38:07,747 --> 00:38:10,947
Screw the plants. I hate the music.

406
00:38:11,087 --> 00:38:14,167
It's wonderful for my plants.
They just love it.

407
00:38:15,387 --> 00:38:18,336
Plants have feelings, you know,
just like people.

408
00:38:18,466 --> 00:38:22,836
It's fascinating. This type of music
stimulates the growth of the plants.

409
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,176
They've done tons of experiments on it.

410
00:38:25,306 --> 00:38:28,136
- Come on, Nancy. Turn the music off.
- Relax.

411
00:38:28,266 --> 00:38:30,835
You're not gonna enjoy this if you don't.

412
00:39:01,592 --> 00:39:04,622
Oh! Mr Gianni, what are you doing here?

413
00:39:04,762 --> 00:39:07,082
This is must reading, Mrs Bellicec.

414
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:09,502
Worlds ln Collision by Velikovsky.

415
00:39:09,642 --> 00:39:13,051
Oh, yes. I've read that many times.
Have you read Star Maker

416
00:39:13,181 --> 00:39:16,761
by Olaf Stapledon?
That's must reading, too.

417
00:39:18,111 --> 00:39:22,311
- Well, it's awfully late, Mr Gianni.
- You're so smart.

418
00:39:22,441 --> 00:39:25,640
Oh, Mr Gianni,
you've been sitting in that mud too long.

419
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,150
It is possible to overdo it, you know.

420
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:32,730
Oh, by the way, thank you for that plant
you gave me last time.

421
00:40:03,817 --> 00:40:05,847
I'll walk you inside.

422
00:40:06,986 --> 00:40:09,016
You don't have to.

423
00:40:16,786 --> 00:40:18,815
Geoffrey?

424
00:40:22,335 --> 00:40:24,365
That was sweet of him.

425
00:40:42,933 --> 00:40:44,963
You all right?

426
00:40:45,893 --> 00:40:47,923
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

427
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:57,182
Thank you, Matthew.
You've really made me feel better.

428
00:40:57,322 --> 00:40:59,722
And I'm gonna think about
what Kibner said.

429
00:40:59,862 --> 00:41:00,852
OK.

430
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:02,901
Thanks for helping. Goodnight.

431
00:41:03,031 --> 00:41:05,071
See you.

432
00:41:11,501 --> 00:41:13,530
Jack?

433
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,990
Honey, where are ya?

434
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:21,250
I don't wanna disturb you if you're
thinking, but I could do with some food.

435
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:24,049
I haven't eaten all day. Oh...

436
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:29,379
Oh, Jack, you're gonna suffocate.

437
00:41:34,768 --> 00:41:36,308
My nose...

438
00:41:38,438 --> 00:41:40,478
Let me out! Let me out!

439
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,348
My nose is bleeding.

440
00:42:06,556 --> 00:42:08,045
Who is it?

441
00:42:09,015 --> 00:42:11,045
Who is it?

442
00:42:14,225 --> 00:42:16,255
It's Matthew.

443
00:42:16,395 --> 00:42:18,794
- Come on in.
- What happened?

444
00:42:18,934 --> 00:42:20,554
Back here.

445
00:42:20,684 --> 00:42:23,394
- Matthew, I called you here as a friend.
- Oh, Jack...

446
00:42:23,524 --> 00:42:28,314
Do you report things like contagious
disease or a body in a place of business?

447
00:42:28,444 --> 00:42:30,523
- Let him look at it.
- You found a body?

448
00:42:30,653 --> 00:42:33,353
- No, not necessarily.
- I thought it was Jack.

449
00:42:34,453 --> 00:42:36,023
Is that him?

450
00:42:36,163 --> 00:42:38,193
Yeah, under there.

451
00:42:40,872 --> 00:42:43,442
- What kind of joke is this?
- It's no joke.

452
00:42:44,082 --> 00:42:46,122
What is it?

453
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:57,961
- What the hell is it?!
- Just keep calm, Nancy.

454
00:42:59,471 --> 00:43:01,511
Is it contagious?

455
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,010
- Did any of your customers see this?
- No.

456
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,510
It'd ruin us.

457
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,760
- I'm calling the police.
- Don't do that.

458
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,260
- Why?
- Nancy, don't.

459
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,350
Because I think Jack is right.

460
00:43:13,069 --> 00:43:15,269
It's not immature exactly.

461
00:43:15,409 --> 00:43:17,149
He's got an adult face.

462
00:43:17,279 --> 00:43:21,189
- It's a monster. It's got hair all over it.
- It's vague.

463
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:23,568
Nose, lips, hair.

464
00:43:23,708 --> 00:43:27,448
Hands, everything,
but no detail, no character. It's unformed.

465
00:43:27,578 --> 00:43:30,948
Jack, don't touch it.
You don't know where it's been.

466
00:43:32,298 --> 00:43:34,327
No respiration.

467
00:43:34,467 --> 00:43:36,577
It's got no fingerprints.

468
00:43:37,007 --> 00:43:39,037
No fingerprints?

469
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,957
Like a foetus.

470
00:43:43,097 --> 00:43:45,127
You just said it was an adult.

471
00:43:45,266 --> 00:43:47,966
I said it was an adult because it was tall.

472
00:43:48,106 --> 00:43:51,846
- How tall are you, Jack?
- Six foot four.

473
00:43:51,976 --> 00:43:55,186
- How much do you weigh?
- 170.

474
00:43:55,316 --> 00:43:57,685
- Why?
- Oh, no.

475
00:43:59,275 --> 00:44:00,765
No, Matthew.

476
00:44:01,985 --> 00:44:03,815
Oh, Jack!

477
00:44:03,945 --> 00:44:06,565
- Who are you calling?
- Elizabeth.

478
00:44:06,705 --> 00:44:08,734
Why?

479
00:44:08,914 --> 00:44:11,114
Why are you calling Elizabeth?

480
00:44:11,244 --> 00:44:13,694
- Matthew...
- Why?

481
00:44:25,053 --> 00:44:26,213
Hello?

482
00:44:26,343 --> 00:44:30,252
Elizabeth? Can you hear me?
It's Matthew, Elizabeth. Hello?

483
00:44:30,892 --> 00:44:32,132
What's the matter?

484
00:44:32,262 --> 00:44:34,662
Elizabeth, can you hear me?

485
00:44:34,812 --> 00:44:36,632
Who is this?

486
00:44:38,022 --> 00:44:40,051
Hello?

487
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,869
- Where are you going?
- A friend of mine is in trouble.

488
00:45:03,999 --> 00:45:06,489
- What are we to do?
- Phone David Kibner.

489
00:45:06,629 --> 00:45:10,319
Ask him to meet me here right away.
There's his number.

490
00:45:10,469 --> 00:45:12,499
- What's the matter?
- I'm tired.

491
00:45:13,558 --> 00:45:15,298
Stand up.

492
00:45:15,428 --> 00:45:19,088
- Stand up! Now walk around!
- Honey, I'm dry! I'm very dry.

493
00:45:19,228 --> 00:45:21,968
I'll get you a drink. Just don't fall asleep.

494
00:45:31,617 --> 00:45:33,227
- Here, sweetie.
- Thanks, sweetie.

495
00:45:33,367 --> 00:45:35,396
Dr Kibner will be here soon.

496
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:41,816
I'm gonna lie down and think, honey.

497
00:45:42,286 --> 00:45:44,326
I'm just gonna think.

498
00:46:33,631 --> 00:46:35,701
Jack, wake up! lts eyes!

499
00:46:35,841 --> 00:46:38,661
Oh, Jack. It opened its eyes.

500
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,589
See?

501
00:46:54,809 --> 00:46:55,799
Hon?

502
00:50:35,389 --> 00:50:36,799
Wake up.

503
00:50:36,929 --> 00:50:38,339
Wake up!

504
00:52:45,427 --> 00:52:48,877
I can't find anything in here
that looks like a body.

505
00:52:49,007 --> 00:52:50,837
- No body?
- What!

506
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:53,796
- Did you check the last...
- I looked everywhere.

507
00:52:53,926 --> 00:52:55,296
Hey! Did you... Hey!

508
00:52:55,436 --> 00:52:59,206
- Did you check the last booth on the left?
- There's no body there.

509
00:52:59,356 --> 00:53:01,386
It's got to be in here!

510
00:53:04,025 --> 00:53:07,475
- Did it have a pulse, a heartbeat?
- It opened its eyes.

511
00:53:07,605 --> 00:53:11,065
- You actually saw that?
- I saw its nose bleed.

512
00:53:11,445 --> 00:53:14,354
It had white hair, that touched my hand.

513
00:53:14,904 --> 00:53:16,944
There's something in here.

514
00:53:19,744 --> 00:53:23,114
Nancy lost an old guy in here once.
He had a heart attack and sank.

515
00:53:27,793 --> 00:53:29,453
Face it, Bellicec.

516
00:53:29,593 --> 00:53:32,493
You've got some friends
who enjoy practical jokes.

517
00:53:32,633 --> 00:53:34,913
I don't have any friends, Dr Kibner.

518
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:38,042
Then some enemies.

519
00:53:38,182 --> 00:53:39,452
Look.

520
00:53:43,352 --> 00:53:45,382
Who opened this up?

521
00:54:10,249 --> 00:54:12,699
Wait a second, wait a second.
Who is it?

522
00:54:15,799 --> 00:54:18,419
- Matthew, the body's gone.
- Somebody's took it.

523
00:54:18,549 --> 00:54:21,748
- No. Did you see it?
- There was nothing here to see.

524
00:54:22,508 --> 00:54:24,708
Who are you waking up now, Matthew?

525
00:54:24,848 --> 00:54:28,128
Police? I would like to report a body.

526
00:54:30,647 --> 00:54:32,637
Take her to my place fast.

527
00:54:32,767 --> 00:54:35,637
Don't let anybody in
until we get back there.

528
00:55:05,804 --> 00:55:08,284
Lieutenant, these fellas reported the body.

529
00:55:08,424 --> 00:55:11,714
- You both saw it?
- No, I'm the only one. Matthew Bennell.

530
00:55:11,844 --> 00:55:15,963
- Mr Bennell, show me where you saw it.
- It's right up here.

531
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:18,263
Where's Elizabeth?

532
00:55:32,452 --> 00:55:33,862
- Where?
- There.

533
00:55:33,992 --> 00:55:36,151
- It's Elizabeth's double.
- Where?

534
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,241
Lots of leaves and a pot.

535
00:55:38,371 --> 00:55:41,781
It was there, David.
I swear to God it was there!

536
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:44,741
Officer, there was a duplicate
of Elizabeth Driscoll,

537
00:55:44,881 --> 00:55:47,120
- and it's been taken.
- The missing woman?

538
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,120
- She's not missing.
- Where is she?

539
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:51,650
- She's at Matthew's.
- Don't tell him that!

540
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,370
- Then there is no missing body.
- That's right.

541
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:57,129
- There is and he's taken it!
- No, he took Elizabeth.

542
00:55:57,259 --> 00:55:59,009
- You took Elizabeth away?
- Yes!

543
00:55:59,139 --> 00:56:02,179
- You broke in here.
- I had to because she was not safe here.

544
00:56:02,309 --> 00:56:03,799
So you took her out of here.

545
00:56:03,939 --> 00:56:07,928
No! I took her from there.
Her other body was in here...

546
00:56:08,068 --> 00:56:10,738
Please stop.
Matthew, that's enough! Please stop!

547
00:56:10,858 --> 00:56:13,978
- Lieutenant, I'm Dr David Kibner.
- Ah, the psychiatrist.

548
00:56:14,108 --> 00:56:15,768
My wife reads your books.

549
00:56:15,908 --> 00:56:18,438
- I'm glad. It sounds complicated,...
- David...

550
00:56:18,578 --> 00:56:22,517
..but my friend has had some difficult
emotional experiences recently.

551
00:56:22,657 --> 00:56:26,737
But I think this is something
we can work out amongst ourselves.

552
00:56:26,877 --> 00:56:30,566
- All right, I'll leave this part of it with you.
- I appreciate it.

553
00:56:30,706 --> 00:56:33,916
You can't accomplish anything here.
We gotta get outside.

554
00:56:35,796 --> 00:56:40,915
I think you might wanna consider filing
an unlawful entry against Mr Bennell.

555
00:56:41,055 --> 00:56:43,375
I know what you're saying, but outside...

556
00:56:43,515 --> 00:56:47,845
No, I'll take Dr Kibner's word
that Elizabeth is all right.

557
00:56:48,565 --> 00:56:51,015
- Fine, then let's go.
- OK.

558
00:56:55,154 --> 00:56:57,184
Will Elizabeth be coming home?

559
00:56:58,734 --> 00:56:59,724
No.

560
00:57:01,244 --> 00:57:03,603
I have to pick up some of her clothes.

561
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:07,863
All right.

562
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:39,930
All right, let's back up
and go through it once more,

563
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:42,350
step by step.

564
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,269
You all thought you saw a body
at the baths.

565
00:57:47,409 --> 00:57:50,689
You thought it was dead.
You didn't know what it was.

566
00:57:52,949 --> 00:57:55,949
You touched it. All of you touched it.

567
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:03,538
- Nancy, you saw it open its eyes.
- It looked right at me.

568
00:58:05,508 --> 00:58:09,327
- And, Bellicec, you saw its eyes open.
- No, I saw its nose bleed.

569
00:58:09,467 --> 00:58:12,797
If you saw its nose bleed,
and Nancy saw its eyes open,

570
00:58:12,927 --> 00:58:14,757
he must have been alive.

571
00:58:17,267 --> 00:58:20,926
No, David. You're looking at it
as if it was human. It was not human.

572
00:58:22,106 --> 00:58:25,766
- Matthew, what else would it be?
- It was something, but not human.

573
00:58:25,896 --> 00:58:28,146
- It had white hair on it.
- It was growing.

574
00:58:28,276 --> 00:58:29,855
The one at Jack's was...

575
00:58:29,985 --> 00:58:33,645
It was like Jack, but not as developed
as the one at Elizabeth's place.

576
00:58:33,785 --> 00:58:35,605
It had tendrils on it.

577
00:58:35,745 --> 00:58:37,815
The one at her place was duplicating her.

578
00:58:37,955 --> 00:58:39,985
If Matthew hadn't taken me away,

579
00:58:40,125 --> 00:58:43,694
the same thing that's happened
to Geoffrey would have happened to me.

580
00:58:43,834 --> 00:58:48,324
Elizabeth, would you please tell me, in
your opinion, exactly what is happening?

581
00:58:51,424 --> 00:58:53,583
People are being duplicated.

582
00:58:54,713 --> 00:58:58,083
And once it's happened to you,
you're part of this thing.

583
00:58:59,473 --> 00:59:01,213
It almost happened to me!

584
00:59:02,722 --> 00:59:04,212
Look,

585
00:59:04,352 --> 00:59:09,422
the reason you don't believe Elizabeth
is because the other body disappeared.

586
00:59:09,562 --> 00:59:12,602
It disappeared because Geoffrey took it.

587
00:59:12,732 --> 00:59:15,401
Well, then what happened
to my other body, then?

588
00:59:15,531 --> 00:59:18,271
Oh, people,
will you please listen to yourselves?

589
00:59:18,401 --> 00:59:20,561
Will you listen to what you are saying?

590
00:59:20,701 --> 00:59:25,610
I can deal with a body being moved and
even with a body getting up and leaving,

591
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:29,520
but when you start talking about
his other body, being duplicated...

592
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:31,360
Listen to how that sounds.

593
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,950
We know how insane this sounds!
But what do you think we're doing?

594
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:37,249
Do you think we're making it up?

595
00:59:37,379 --> 00:59:41,669
Do you believe that my body looked like
me and that her body looked like her?

596
00:59:41,799 --> 00:59:43,459
D'you think we're crazy?

597
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:48,588
You are trying to make us believe
that we are seeing things. Why?

598
00:59:48,728 --> 00:59:51,088
All I'm trying to do is help.

599
00:59:51,228 --> 00:59:55,428
You call me in the middle of the night and
ask me to help. That's all I'm trying to do.

600
00:59:55,568 --> 00:59:57,557
Well, I'm sorry if we woke you up!

601
00:59:57,687 --> 01:00:01,017
If we inconvenienced you,
I guess we owe you an apology.

602
01:00:01,157 --> 01:00:04,517
I mean, I mean...
I guess that's a rotten thing to do!

603
01:00:06,327 --> 01:00:08,356
You've upset my wife, too.

604
01:00:14,746 --> 01:00:17,656
David, I don't know what it is
or where it comes from,

605
01:00:17,796 --> 01:00:19,825
but I saw it and I'm gonna fight it.

606
01:00:19,965 --> 01:00:23,245
Matthew, my friend,... I believe you.

607
01:00:24,675 --> 01:00:27,205
I've known you too long
not to believe you.

608
01:00:27,345 --> 01:00:29,375
What do you wanna do?

609
01:00:29,515 --> 01:00:33,834
Well, if I could get official support,
I'd institute the emergency procedures

610
01:00:33,974 --> 01:00:36,754
that we use for cholera
or legionnaires' disease.

611
01:00:36,894 --> 01:00:40,724
- What do you want me to do?
- I can handle the Health Department.

612
01:00:40,854 --> 01:00:44,343
But if panic breaks out,
we'll need the police and the Guard,

613
01:00:44,483 --> 01:00:46,643
and that means the Mayor and...

614
01:00:47,653 --> 01:00:50,223
The Mayor's a patient of yours, isn't he?

615
01:00:50,993 --> 01:00:53,022
How did you know that?

616
01:00:53,952 --> 01:00:55,982
What do you want me to do?

617
01:00:56,122 --> 01:00:58,572
Would you ask him
to accept my telephone call?

618
01:00:58,702 --> 01:01:01,072
I'll call him in a hour. I'll be at my office.

619
01:01:01,212 --> 01:01:03,771
If you have any other ideas, get in touch.

620
01:01:06,251 --> 01:01:08,291
Call me.

621
01:01:09,591 --> 01:01:11,621
Thank you.

622
01:01:37,028 --> 01:01:39,068
The sooner the better.

623
01:01:41,748 --> 01:01:43,528
This smells lovely.

624
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:46,867
- I want you to listen to me.
- I am listening to you, Nancy.

625
01:01:46,997 --> 01:01:50,687
I am not seeing things.
I know I saw what I saw

626
01:01:50,837 --> 01:01:54,697
and I know it was turning into you, Jack.
Now, that body we found...

627
01:01:54,837 --> 01:01:57,167
That flower. Where did you get that?

628
01:01:57,297 --> 01:02:00,376
- In the vase with the others.
- Just stuck in there?

629
01:02:00,506 --> 01:02:03,876
- Yeah. Why?
- Geoffrey gave me one last night.

630
01:02:04,016 --> 01:02:05,006
So what?

631
01:02:05,136 --> 01:02:08,176
A customer, Mr Gianni,
brought one of those to the baths.

632
01:02:08,305 --> 01:02:09,175
So what?

633
01:02:09,305 --> 01:02:12,305
- Put it down, Jack.
- It's a pod with a flower on it.

634
01:02:12,435 --> 01:02:16,185
- I could not find that flower in any book.
- Jack, put it down.

635
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:19,974
- It's a pink flower, honey.
- It could be toxic.

636
01:02:20,114 --> 01:02:24,274
I have seen these flowers all over.
They grow like parasites on other plants.

637
01:02:24,404 --> 01:02:26,654
- Where are they coming from?
- Outer space.

638
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:29,154
- They're not from outer space.
- Why not?

639
01:02:29,284 --> 01:02:30,773
- They're not.
- Why?!

640
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:33,153
What are you talking about?
A space flower?

641
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:37,993
Why not a space flower?
Why do we always expect metal ships?

642
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:40,373
I've never expected metal ships.

643
01:02:40,503 --> 01:02:43,072
There must be other ways
they get in our systems.

644
01:02:43,212 --> 01:02:46,582
Right. They could be getting into us
through touch or fragrance.

645
01:02:46,722 --> 01:02:50,292
We would never even notice it,
not from the impurities we have.

646
01:02:50,432 --> 01:02:53,131
I mean, we eat junk and we breathe junk.

647
01:02:53,271 --> 01:02:58,091
I don't know where they're coming from,
but I feel as though I've been poisoned.

648
01:02:58,231 --> 01:03:01,431
We've gotta take those flowers in
and have them analysed.

649
01:03:01,571 --> 01:03:04,520
- There's something here.
- They could get into us

650
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:08,690
and screw up our genes like DNA,
recombine us, change us.

651
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:10,310
Oh, of course!

652
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:13,530
This is the same way
those rockets landed years ago,

653
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:17,949
so those spacemen could mate with
monkeys and create the human race.

654
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:20,279
It's happening now!

655
01:03:30,388 --> 01:03:33,748
- Who do you wish to speak to?
- David Kibner.

656
01:03:33,888 --> 01:03:36,667
He's not in right now.
He'll be back this afternoon.

657
01:03:36,807 --> 01:03:41,637
Could you leave a message for him?
Matthew Bennell. B-E-N-N-E-L-L.

658
01:03:41,767 --> 01:03:45,597
- And your number, please?
- No, he's got my number. Thank you.

659
01:03:52,446 --> 01:03:55,116
James Grala, Deputy City Attorney.
Can I help you?

660
01:03:55,236 --> 01:03:56,856
My name is Matthew Bennell.

661
01:03:56,996 --> 01:04:00,605
B-E-N-N-E-L-L.
I'm a deputy public health inspector.

662
01:04:00,745 --> 01:04:03,865
- Is this another call about impostors?
- Yes.

663
01:04:03,995 --> 01:04:06,195
- We're the first agency you called?
- Yes.

664
01:04:06,335 --> 01:04:09,284
Good. Listen, Mr Bennell,
we don't wanna create a panic.

665
01:04:09,424 --> 01:04:11,204
No-one here knows.

666
01:04:11,334 --> 01:04:13,824
I'd like you to stay by yourphone
for a while.

667
01:04:13,964 --> 01:04:17,044
I'll have somebody call you back
and take down all you know.

668
01:04:17,174 --> 01:04:19,004
All right, thank you.

669
01:04:21,183 --> 01:04:24,293
This is a busy lab, Elizabeth.
We don't test flowers.

670
01:04:24,433 --> 01:04:27,763
- They go to the Depart of Agriculture.
- I know where they go!

671
01:04:27,933 --> 01:04:31,682
I think this is our problem.
I think it is affecting people.

672
01:04:32,062 --> 01:04:33,802
How?

673
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:39,522
Look, Allen, I have already said
that I'll do all the testing.

674
01:04:39,652 --> 01:04:42,021
You don't have to lift a finger. Can l?

675
01:04:42,871 --> 01:04:47,151
You've been consistently late, Elizabeth,
and you're behind in your work,

676
01:04:47,291 --> 01:04:49,321
so I'll do the tests for you.

677
01:04:50,411 --> 01:04:52,160
Thank you.

678
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:55,370
- It'll take 48 hours.
- Allen, 24.

679
01:04:56,630 --> 01:05:01,330
I can't understand why you've become
so emotional about a little flower.

680
01:05:05,469 --> 01:05:06,459
Hello.

681
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:07,789
- Mr Bennell?
- Yes.

682
01:05:07,929 --> 01:05:09,919
- From the Health Department?
- Yes.

683
01:05:10,059 --> 01:05:13,139
- It's Ted Jessop, the Mayor's assistant.
- Yes.

684
01:05:13,269 --> 01:05:16,178
- You've come across something strange?
- Yes.

685
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:18,878
I'd like to suggest
we meet in Union Square.

686
01:05:19,028 --> 01:05:21,888
- We can't talk over the phone.
- Right away.

687
01:05:24,158 --> 01:05:26,857
So you'll meet me here again tomorrow,
Mr Bennell?

688
01:05:26,987 --> 01:05:27,857
Yeah.

689
01:05:27,987 --> 01:05:30,187
Don't say a word to anyone. Keep it quiet.

690
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:32,357
Whatever you say.

691
01:05:38,206 --> 01:05:41,866
- Please deposit 15 cents.
- Operator, I put in a quarter...

692
01:05:44,546 --> 01:05:47,625
This is Judy Hinkell,
the Mayor's special assistant.

693
01:05:47,755 --> 01:05:50,045
Yes. My name is Matthew Bennell.

694
01:05:50,175 --> 01:05:52,045
The Mayor's in conference,

695
01:05:52,175 --> 01:05:55,835
but Dr Kibner called him personally
to express his concern.

696
01:05:55,975 --> 01:05:57,594
And, Mr Bennell,

697
01:05:57,724 --> 01:06:02,264
we're asking for your discretion
because this thing might be abating.

698
01:06:04,944 --> 01:06:06,184
Hello?

699
01:06:06,314 --> 01:06:07,894
- Matthew Bennell?
- Yes.

700
01:06:08,024 --> 01:06:11,103
I'm Michaels,
from the Federal Preparedness Agency.

701
01:06:11,243 --> 01:06:14,693
These reports ofstrange,
unexplained, diseased bodies.

702
01:06:14,823 --> 01:06:17,733
My understanding is
you haven't analysed anything

703
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:20,322
- and you have no tissue samples.
- No, I'm...

704
01:06:20,452 --> 01:06:24,742
Mr Bennell, it seems you'rejust winging
your conclusions. Keep an open mind.

705
01:06:24,872 --> 01:06:26,282
I had no intention...

706
01:06:26,422 --> 01:06:29,092
Don't mention to anyone
about duplicate bodies.

707
01:06:29,212 --> 01:06:32,701
- I was gonna treat it...
- Excuse me, my otherphone is ringing.

708
01:06:35,011 --> 01:06:38,001
- Yes?
- This is serious business, Mr Bennell.

709
01:06:38,141 --> 01:06:41,510
- Is thisjust a case ofparanoia?
- No, no, no.

710
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:45,220
Know what mass hysteria looks like,
Mr Bennell?

711
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:48,760
- We don't want to create a panic.
- We have a primary authority.

712
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:50,220
Be cautious.

713
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:52,309
You sound distressed.

714
01:06:52,439 --> 01:06:56,939
- I think the horizon looks bright.
- People are returning to normal.

715
01:06:57,069 --> 01:06:59,149
No, no. She all right.

716
01:06:59,279 --> 01:07:02,479
She better now. Much better now.

717
01:07:06,828 --> 01:07:09,308
- Did your husband ask you to come?
- No, no.

718
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:12,988
I want everybody to see
that I'm back to myself again.

719
01:07:13,958 --> 01:07:15,287
No, wait. Please.

720
01:07:15,917 --> 01:07:18,037
I'll see you soon, I hope.

721
01:07:57,334 --> 01:07:59,873
Matthew, I'm not getting a thing here.

722
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:04,373
Where is the...
I'm not getting any news here.

723
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:07,253
Isn't there a 24-hour news?

724
01:08:08,722 --> 01:08:11,502
I would think you'd have
a good reception on the hill.

725
01:08:11,642 --> 01:08:15,632
There's a repair truck out here.
Could that be to do with it?

726
01:09:15,736 --> 01:09:20,526
She just needs something to help her
sleep. Tomorrow she'll be good as new.

727
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:25,195
I would suggest you get some sleep, too.
You've done everything you possibly can.

728
01:09:28,835 --> 01:09:31,365
Can I give the Bellicecs a ride?

729
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:33,915
No, I'm not going back there.

730
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:36,914
- We'll just get a motel.
- You can stay here.

731
01:09:38,804 --> 01:09:39,754
Thank you.

732
01:09:40,974 --> 01:09:42,754
Come on.

733
01:09:42,894 --> 01:09:46,344
I appreciate everything you've done,
David. Thank you.

734
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:51,553
- Get some sleep.
- Sure. See you.

735
01:14:51,126 --> 01:14:54,285
Matthew. Matthew.

736
01:15:02,885 --> 01:15:05,674
Matthew, they're growing.
They're everywhere!

737
01:15:12,144 --> 01:15:13,304
Wake the others!

738
01:15:22,153 --> 01:15:24,983
Elizabeth, wake up!
They're growing out of these pods.

739
01:15:26,322 --> 01:15:30,152
- I'll get the police.
- Elizabeth, wake up.

740
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:32,652
They get you when you sleep. Sit up!

741
01:15:32,792 --> 01:15:35,572
Elizabeth! Elizabeth, would you wake up?

742
01:15:35,712 --> 01:15:36,901
Hello. Police.

743
01:15:37,041 --> 01:15:40,371
Officer, I would like to report
four bodies in my backyard.

744
01:15:40,501 --> 01:15:41,501
You OK?

745
01:15:41,631 --> 01:15:44,161
- Wait there, Mr Bennell.
- How do you know my name?

746
01:15:44,301 --> 01:15:45,671
Hang up, Matthew.

747
01:15:45,801 --> 01:15:47,830
- I didn't tell you my name!
- Hang up.

748
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:51,630
- I didn't tell them my name!
- They're all a part of it.

749
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:55,510
They're all pods, all of them.

750
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:00,349
- Who are you calling?
- Washington.

751
01:16:00,479 --> 01:16:02,559
The CIA? The FBl? They're pods already.

752
01:16:02,689 --> 01:16:06,599
I've got a friend in the Justice Department.
I can dial direct.

753
01:16:06,739 --> 01:16:09,728
- What are you gonna tell him?
- Oh, my God!

754
01:16:10,238 --> 01:16:12,278
They grow out of those pods!

755
01:16:12,408 --> 01:16:14,188
They cut our power.

756
01:16:26,427 --> 01:16:29,327
Matthew, they're barricading the street.

757
01:16:29,467 --> 01:16:30,627
No!

758
01:16:40,356 --> 01:16:44,385
- What number are you calling from?
- Operator? I was dialling direct.

759
01:16:44,525 --> 01:16:46,555
I'll try the number, Mr Bennell.

760
01:16:52,944 --> 01:16:56,854
- They're coming up here.
- Hang up, Matthew.

761
01:16:58,074 --> 01:17:00,114
Matthew, do you have a gun?

762
01:17:00,784 --> 01:17:01,774
No.

763
01:17:01,914 --> 01:17:05,073
- What are we gonna do?
- Out the back door.

764
01:17:06,333 --> 01:17:08,363
Hurry up! Jack!

765
01:17:14,263 --> 01:17:18,672
That way. Under the stairs.
Go on. I'll catch up with you.

766
01:18:03,508 --> 01:18:05,708
Go on, keep on running! Don't stop!

767
01:18:08,518 --> 01:18:10,087
Go on!

768
01:18:28,156 --> 01:18:30,196
Quickly. Follow me.

769
01:20:30,015 --> 01:20:32,054
We're being cornered!

770
01:20:40,774 --> 01:20:42,273
Jesus!

771
01:20:47,203 --> 01:20:48,563
Get down!

772
01:20:50,993 --> 01:20:54,192
Matthew, keep them here
and I'll come back with help.

773
01:20:54,332 --> 01:20:55,352
Jack.

774
01:20:58,832 --> 01:21:01,282
- Jack!
- No, Nancy.

775
01:21:01,502 --> 01:21:04,911
- No, Jack! Jack!
- Get down.

776
01:21:06,881 --> 01:21:08,921
Here I am, you pod bastard!

777
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:10,921
Hey, pods!

778
01:21:11,061 --> 01:21:13,051
Come and get me, you scum!

779
01:21:35,409 --> 01:21:37,608
Wharf area is secure. Ten-four.

780
01:21:41,748 --> 01:21:45,248
Suspects escaping. Suspects escaping.

781
01:23:18,339 --> 01:23:20,499
Oh, yeah, showtime!

782
01:23:20,629 --> 01:23:24,409
Yes, sir, you're walking the right way.
We got nude girls...

783
01:23:26,428 --> 01:23:28,628
It's all going on right here.

784
01:23:28,768 --> 01:23:32,218
It's all live, it's all naked, sir.
Guaranteed action here.

785
01:23:32,348 --> 01:23:34,888
Guaranteed to make you
feel like a new man.

786
01:23:35,018 --> 01:23:37,217
Come on back here! Come on back here!

787
01:23:37,357 --> 01:23:39,757
D'you hear me? Come on back here!
This is it.

788
01:23:39,897 --> 01:23:42,377
We got male and female love back here...

789
01:23:56,246 --> 01:23:58,286
- Where to?
- The airport.

790
01:24:03,045 --> 01:24:05,915
Pacific and Hyde. Pacific and Hyde.

791
01:24:07,135 --> 01:24:10,084
6-10 proceeding south to airport,

792
01:24:10,214 --> 01:24:13,584
carrying two passengers, type H.

793
01:24:13,724 --> 01:24:17,134
- Repeat. Type H.
- 6-10, confirmed.

794
01:24:17,264 --> 01:24:18,594
Some night, eh?

795
01:24:18,724 --> 01:24:20,304
- Take 280 south on ramp.
- Yeah.

796
01:24:21,393 --> 01:24:25,053
Type H unit established
in Financial and South ofMarket.

797
01:24:25,193 --> 01:24:27,143
Repeat. Financial and South ofMarket.

798
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:55,840
Lombard on the Golden Gate.

799
01:24:55,970 --> 01:24:57,540
Where are you heading?

800
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:00,340
I said. The airport.

801
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:02,050
No. I mean which airline.

802
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:05,469
- Market and 14th. Market and 14th.
- United.

803
01:25:05,599 --> 01:25:07,639
You got business outta town?

804
01:25:09,439 --> 01:25:13,559
No, we're not leaving. We're meeting
someone coming in from Boston.

805
01:25:13,689 --> 01:25:16,728
All fares at North Beach, regroup.

806
01:25:17,238 --> 01:25:21,148
Divisadero and Haight. Divisadero
and Haight. Divisadero and Haight.

807
01:25:21,288 --> 01:25:23,318
What is it?

808
01:25:23,498 --> 01:25:25,318
What's going on?

809
01:25:25,458 --> 01:25:27,567
Oh, nothing.

810
01:25:43,136 --> 01:25:44,376
Both of 'em.

811
01:26:21,712 --> 01:26:24,912
- Harry, pooch, wake up!
- Look, there's a pod.

812
01:29:15,287 --> 01:29:20,156
All those with families
in Berkeley, Oakland and Elizabeth.

813
01:29:23,416 --> 01:29:25,576
Unit Seven, special assistance.

814
01:29:25,716 --> 01:29:28,705
Could we have you
over by the Health Department?

815
01:29:29,255 --> 01:29:33,085
Red city, please.
All with red city families.

816
01:29:33,225 --> 01:29:36,385
Look at them!
Right out in the open.

817
01:29:36,515 --> 01:29:38,964
That's how they do it.

818
01:29:39,104 --> 01:29:42,714
That's how they spread it.
All those people are changed.

819
01:29:50,523 --> 01:29:52,643
Unit Seven, special assistance.

820
01:29:53,783 --> 01:29:57,273
Could we have you over
by the Health Department immediately?

821
01:30:01,492 --> 01:30:03,862
Matthew, we'll never be able to stop them!

822
01:30:04,002 --> 01:30:05,902
Yes, we will.

823
01:30:06,042 --> 01:30:08,742
We can't!
Look it, they control the whole city.

824
01:30:08,882 --> 01:30:10,911
We'll find a way somehow.

825
01:30:12,211 --> 01:30:14,251
Oh, Matthew, I can't go on!

826
01:30:15,631 --> 01:30:18,631
I wanna go to sleep.
I can't stay awake any more.

827
01:30:20,141 --> 01:30:22,170
You have to.

828
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:26,300
You have to stay awake.

829
01:30:37,949 --> 01:30:42,189
Would somebody in transportation
report to the Grove Street terminal?

830
01:30:44,828 --> 01:30:48,818
Yup. Boccardo's pills.
He eats these like candy... or he used to.

831
01:30:48,958 --> 01:30:50,528
Take some.

832
01:30:50,668 --> 01:30:53,148
- What are they?
- Speed. It'll keep us awake.

833
01:30:53,298 --> 01:30:56,617
- How many are you supposed to take?
- It says "Take one".

834
01:30:56,757 --> 01:30:58,787
Take five.

835
01:31:09,346 --> 01:31:11,386
They know we're here.

836
01:31:20,155 --> 01:31:21,685
Jack, my God!

837
01:31:21,815 --> 01:31:23,355
No.

838
01:31:24,655 --> 01:31:28,894
Would have been a lot easier
if we'd just gone to sleep last night.

839
01:31:29,034 --> 01:31:30,104
David, no!

840
01:31:30,244 --> 01:31:33,364
- Oh, my God! No! No! Matthew!
- Don't touch her!

841
01:31:33,494 --> 01:31:36,364
David, don't let them touch her!
Don't let them touch her!

842
01:31:36,504 --> 01:31:38,073
Don't let them touch her.

843
01:31:38,213 --> 01:31:40,693
- What are you gonna do?
- We'll leave the city!

844
01:31:40,833 --> 01:31:43,233
- Please, Geoffrey.
- David, let us go.

845
01:31:43,383 --> 01:31:46,503
- Let us leave the city!
- You don't have to leave the city.

846
01:31:46,633 --> 01:31:49,372
Nothing changes.
You can have the same life.

847
01:31:49,512 --> 01:31:51,252
But what happens to us?

848
01:31:51,892 --> 01:31:55,252
You'll be born again
into an untroubled world,

849
01:31:55,392 --> 01:31:57,952
free of anxiety, fear,...

850
01:31:58,102 --> 01:31:59,971
- Wait.
- ..hate.

851
01:32:00,101 --> 01:32:03,351
- David, you're killing us.
- That's not true. David's right.

852
01:32:03,481 --> 01:32:08,631
Your minds and memories'll be totally
absorbed. Everything remains intact.

853
01:32:08,781 --> 01:32:12,400
You've never agreed with him in your life
before! What are you talking about?

854
01:32:12,530 --> 01:32:14,560
What are you...

855
01:32:25,749 --> 01:32:28,579
David, you're killing me.

856
01:32:49,527 --> 01:32:53,387
- What is this supposed to do?
- Just a mild sedative to help you sleep.

857
01:32:54,406 --> 01:32:57,686
- I hate you.
- We don't hate you.

858
01:32:57,826 --> 01:33:01,236
There's no need for hate now...
or love.

859
01:33:02,786 --> 01:33:04,616
I love you, Matthew.

860
01:33:07,165 --> 01:33:09,365
There are people who will fight you.

861
01:33:10,755 --> 01:33:12,785
They'll stop you.

862
01:33:12,965 --> 01:33:16,164
In an hour... you won't want them to.

863
01:33:27,973 --> 01:33:30,343
Don't be trapped by old concepts.

864
01:33:34,693 --> 01:33:37,173
You're evolving into a new life form.

865
01:33:39,612 --> 01:33:41,642
Come and watch.

866
01:33:55,171 --> 01:33:57,841
We came here from a dying world.

867
01:33:58,751 --> 01:34:02,250
We drift through the universe
from planet to planet,

868
01:34:02,380 --> 01:34:04,410
pushed on by the solar winds.

869
01:34:04,630 --> 01:34:07,790
We adapt... and we survive.

870
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:11,669
- The function of life is survival.
- Elizabeth!

871
01:34:28,698 --> 01:34:30,728
Open the freezer, quick.

872
01:34:30,868 --> 01:34:33,147
- This door?
- Yup.

873
01:34:40,667 --> 01:34:42,697
Shut the door.

874
01:34:49,296 --> 01:34:51,336
How are we gonna get outta here?

875
01:34:52,636 --> 01:34:54,715
Through the door. Come on.

876
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:31,832
What's that?

877
01:35:36,672 --> 01:35:38,671
I've lost Jack.

878
01:35:38,801 --> 01:35:40,581
We got separated.

879
01:35:45,431 --> 01:35:49,800
I don't know where he is. I've looked
everywhere. Have you seen him?

880
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:54,010
Nancy, this building is surrounded.
How did you get in?

881
01:35:54,150 --> 01:35:58,310
I've been wandering among 'em for hours.
They can be fooled.

882
01:35:58,450 --> 01:36:00,269
How?

883
01:36:00,409 --> 01:36:03,149
Don't show any emotions.
Hide your feelings.

884
01:36:03,279 --> 01:36:07,359
- And when you sleep?
- We'll watch over each other.

885
01:36:09,289 --> 01:36:11,688
- OK.
- Let's find Jack.

886
01:36:13,918 --> 01:36:16,318
We're going to beat them. OK?

887
01:36:17,338 --> 01:36:18,328
OK.

888
01:36:38,646 --> 01:36:40,936
Hey! The lines are over there.

889
01:36:49,575 --> 01:36:52,445
XB-25. XB-25. Station 5. Come in.

890
01:36:52,575 --> 01:36:57,194
Yes. Station 5. Proceeding
as per plan B. Awaiting Kibner unit.

891
01:36:57,334 --> 01:36:58,654
Station 5. Come in.

892
01:36:58,794 --> 01:37:03,534
XB-25. In front of the Health Department.
Request instructions.

893
01:37:03,674 --> 01:37:09,253
You are in the rightplace for Sausalito.
Please keep moving right along.

894
01:37:10,803 --> 01:37:12,833
Sausalito only, please.

895
01:37:14,553 --> 01:37:16,592
Ask ifyou have a question.

896
01:37:20,142 --> 01:37:23,762
The yellow zone
is for loading and unloading only.

897
01:37:25,822 --> 01:37:29,671
If you have other business,
stay clear ofthe yellow.

898
01:37:30,691 --> 01:37:36,061
Stay clear ofthe yellow.
That's for loading or unloading.

899
01:37:48,799 --> 01:37:50,829
Get them! Get them!

900
01:37:51,799 --> 01:37:53,829
Get them!

901
01:38:59,863 --> 01:39:01,893
Come on, get up.

902
01:39:13,372 --> 01:39:15,402
Oh, God!

903
01:39:51,618 --> 01:39:53,648
You see them?

904
01:39:53,908 --> 01:39:57,238
This is where they grow them.
This is where they cultivate them.

905
01:40:01,127 --> 01:40:03,157
It's enormous.

906
01:40:07,967 --> 01:40:10,037
What are we gonna do?
There are so many.

907
01:40:10,177 --> 01:40:13,086
We've got to figure out a way
of stopping them.

908
01:40:19,436 --> 01:40:21,466
Can you walk?

909
01:40:21,605 --> 01:40:24,765
- I'll try.
- Here, hold on to me and try and walk.

910
01:40:40,164 --> 01:40:42,194
Oh, God! Are you all right?

911
01:40:44,543 --> 01:40:46,573
A factory...

912
01:40:46,703 --> 01:40:48,743
They're growing them.

913
01:40:50,463 --> 01:40:52,493
Elizabeth.

914
01:40:55,712 --> 01:40:57,292
I love you.

915
01:40:57,512 --> 01:40:59,462
I love you.

916
01:40:59,632 --> 01:41:01,252
I love you!

917
01:41:03,602 --> 01:41:05,421
Come on.

918
01:41:05,561 --> 01:41:08,631
Oh, I can't. I can't!

919
01:41:33,039 --> 01:41:34,449
Music.

920
01:41:38,009 --> 01:41:40,038
Ships.

921
01:41:40,968 --> 01:41:43,448
Ships... Ships!

922
01:41:44,598 --> 01:41:46,628
Ships! We can get away!

923
01:41:53,057 --> 01:41:56,097
I'll go down there. I'll be right back.
Stay here.

924
01:41:56,227 --> 01:41:57,717
Stay here.

925
01:42:52,902 --> 01:42:55,271
- ..San Francisco Bay area.
- Oh, God!

926
01:42:56,821 --> 01:42:59,221
Mostly fair Saturday night and Sunday.

927
01:42:59,371 --> 01:43:02,281
There will be a cooling trend
with improved visibility.

928
01:43:02,411 --> 01:43:05,950
Night-time lows in the fifties tonight
and in the forties Saturday.

929
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:09,450
Light winds becoming north-westerly,
10-20mph...

930
01:43:27,019 --> 01:43:29,048
Elizabeth, no! No!

931

Wake up!

933
01:43:52,336 --> 01:43:54,156
I love you.

934
01:43:56,586 --> 01:43:58,626
The boat's there, Elizabeth.

935
01:43:58,756 --> 01:44:00,745
The boat's there.

936
01:44:01,675 --> 01:44:03,705
It's gonna take us away.

937
01:44:43,841 --> 01:44:45,871
There's nothing to be afraid of.

938
01:44:46,011 --> 01:44:48,001
They were right.

Sleep.

He must be here somewhere.

944

Let's go this way.

945

- He must be around here somewhere.
- There's one over here, I think.

946
01:51:03,597 --> 01:51:05,427
- We'll get him.
- We'll get him.

947
01:51:06,226 --> 01:51:08,266
He can't stay awake for ever.
