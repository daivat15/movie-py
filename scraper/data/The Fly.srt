2
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,517
What am I working on?

3
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:09,061
Uh, I'm working on something
that'll change the word...

4
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:11,296
...and human life as we know it.

5
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:15,132
Change it a lot or just a bit?
You'll have to be more specific.

6
00:02:15,232 --> 00:02:18,668
What, do you want me to be
specific here, in this room...

7
00:02:18,768 --> 00:02:22,705
...with, uh, half the scientific community
of North America eavesdropping?

8
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:24,805
Is there another way?

9
00:02:24,872 --> 00:02:27,966
Uh, y-you could come back to my lab.

10
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:30,978
Listen, I'II make you cappuccino.

11
00:02:31,078 --> 00:02:33,779
I have a Faema of my very own.
You know what that is?

12
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:36,214
It's not the dilettante's
plastic kitchen model.

13
00:02:36,314 --> 00:02:38,717
It's one of those, uh,
real restaurant espresso machines...

14
00:02:38,817 --> 00:02:40,718
...with the eagle on top and--

15
00:02:40,818 --> 00:02:44,754
Somehow I get the feeling
you don't get out much.

16
00:02:44,854 --> 00:02:46,854
You can tell that?

17
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:48,881
Yeah.

18
00:02:57,163 --> 00:02:59,064
I think you're making a mistake.

19
00:02:59,164 --> 00:03:01,267
I think you really want to talk to me.

20
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:04,369
Sorry. I have three other interviews to do
before this party's over.

21
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:07,838
Yeah, but they're not working on something
that'll change the word as we know it.

22
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,938
They say they are.

23
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:13,408
Yeah, but they're lying.
I'm not.

24
00:03:19,847 --> 00:03:22,407
Are you sick?
- Oh--

25
00:03:22,515 --> 00:03:24,710
Sure.

26
00:03:24,817 --> 00:03:27,962
You're not a very accomplished drunk.

27
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:32,089
No, no. I'm always like this.
It's, uh, motion sickness.

28
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:34,350
When I was a kid,
I, uh...

29
00:03:34,457 --> 00:03:36,497
...puked on my tricycle.

30
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,763
I hate vehicles.
- Should I drive more showily?

31
00:03:40,863 --> 00:03:44,433
No, no. Just turn left.
We're almost there.

32
00:04:00,377 --> 00:04:02,402
This is it?

33
00:04:02,512 --> 00:04:06,209
It's, uh, cleaner on the inside.

34
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,755
Please.

35
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,744
####

36
00:04:47,846 --> 00:04:50,906
Listen, uh,
maybe this is a bad idea.

37
00:04:52,048 --> 00:04:54,048
No. It's too late.

38
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,951
You've already seen them.

39
00:04:56,051 --> 00:04:58,554
Can't let you leave here alive.

40
00:04:58,654 --> 00:05:02,112
####
- I haven't seen anything.

41
00:05:03,224 --> 00:05:05,092
Those.

42
00:05:05,192 --> 00:05:07,854
####

43
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:12,889
Designer phone booths.

44
00:05:12,997 --> 00:05:15,261
Very cute.

45
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:19,135
Hey, I bet you have a really neat
jukebox in here too someplace.

46
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:22,898
Over there maybe?
- No.

47
00:05:24,673 --> 00:05:27,141
No, this is the--

48
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:30,678
This is the prototype of... those.

49
00:05:30,778 --> 00:05:33,213
It's the first one I had made.

50
00:05:33,313 --> 00:05:36,908
It, uh, works,
but it's clunky.

51
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,153
I call them telecoms.

52
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,755
They're controlled by this.

53
00:05:54,762 --> 00:05:57,094
Thank God for that.

54
00:05:58,297 --> 00:06:01,494
So what do they do,
the phone booths?

55
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:04,627
Telepods.

56
00:06:04,736 --> 00:06:06,736
Oh.

57
00:06:06,804 --> 00:06:11,332
Uh, okay. I need an object. Um--

58
00:06:13,309 --> 00:06:16,178
Say, do you have something on you that's...

59
00:06:16,278 --> 00:06:18,312
...uh, personal that I could use?

60
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:21,848
Something uniquely you, an item
of clothing or jewellery?

61
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,948
What, are you kidding?

62
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,950
No, I'm serious.

63
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:31,882
Okay.
Here it goes.

64
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:48,261
Mm-hmm.

65
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:51,594
I don't wear jewellery.

66
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:54,036
Mm-hmm.

67
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:02,371
It's nice.

68
00:07:15,055 --> 00:07:17,055
Uh, Brundle, Seth.

69
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:22,358
Uh, Brundle, Seth.

70
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,590
Uh, Brundle, Seth.

71
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,695
Uh, Brundle, Seth.

72
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,836
Begin teleportation sequence.

73
00:07:36,337 --> 00:07:39,227
Um, keep your eye on the stocking.

74
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,695
Well?

75
00:08:08,795 --> 00:08:10,795
Great.

76
00:08:11,864 --> 00:08:13,766
The word’s largest microwave oven.

77
00:08:13,866 --> 00:08:17,301
I'm glad I didn't give you my Rolex,
if I had a Rolex.

78
00:08:17,401 --> 00:08:20,376
No, you're missing the point. Look.

79
00:08:27,342 --> 00:08:29,342
'Teleportation'?

80
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:32,878
Please.

81
00:08:46,322 --> 00:08:48,322
Oh--

82
00:08:48,424 --> 00:08:50,619
Wait a minute.

83
00:08:50,726 --> 00:08:52,726
Is that a hologram?

84
00:08:52,728 --> 00:08:56,664
Where's my stocking?
- That's it, the real one.

85
00:08:56,764 --> 00:08:58,764
Go ahead.
Pick it up.

86
00:09:11,408 --> 00:09:14,002
I don't think I get it.

87
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,579
What happened?
- You got it, all right.

88
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:19,671
You just can't handle it. Um--

89
00:09:19,781 --> 00:09:23,877
Your stocking has just been teleported...

90
00:09:23,984 --> 00:09:26,817
...from one pod to another...

91
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,756
...uh, disintegrated there
and reintegrated there.

92
00:09:30,856 --> 00:09:32,856
Sort of.

93
00:09:32,858 --> 00:09:36,683
It will change the word
as we know it, right?

94
00:09:39,296 --> 00:09:41,296
Oh, no--

95
00:09:43,098 --> 00:09:46,761
Uh, this is, uh-- This is incredible.

96
00:09:46,868 --> 00:09:48,769
I mean, it's not possible, is it?

97
00:09:48,869 --> 00:09:51,872
How have you managed to keep this quiet?

98
00:09:51,972 --> 00:09:55,341
Please sit down.
- How could you do this alone?

99
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:59,778
Well, I don't work alone. There's a lot
of stuff in there I don't even understand.

100
00:09:59,878 --> 00:10:01,779
I'm really, uh,
a systems management man.

101
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:06,115
I farm bits and pieces out to guys who are
much more brilliant than I am.

102
00:10:06,215 --> 00:10:09,151
I say, 'Build me a laser this.
Design me a molecuIar analyser that.'

103
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:11,253
They do. And I just stick them together.

104
00:10:11,353 --> 00:10:13,621
But none of them knows
what the project really is.

105
00:10:13,721 --> 00:10:15,951
So--

106
00:10:16,056 --> 00:10:18,991
Wow. And, uh, the money?

107
00:10:19,092 --> 00:10:21,126
Bartok Science Industries financed this?

108
00:10:21,226 --> 00:10:25,029
Mm-hmm. But they leave me alone
'cause I'm not expensive.

109
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:28,332
And they know they'll end up
owning it all, whatever it is. So--...

110
00:10:28,432 --> 00:10:31,001
You haven't told them?
- When I'm ready.

111
00:10:31,101 --> 00:10:33,262
Oh. Wait a second.

112
00:10:35,637 --> 00:10:38,268
What are you doing?
- Well, you want me to get...

113
00:10:38,368 --> 00:10:39,907
...the quotes right, don't you?

114
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:42,202
Quotes? No, no.

115
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:46,412
I thought this was personal.
You can't write about this.

116
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,881
What are you taking about?
I'm a journalist.

117
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,883
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

118
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,144
You knew that.
- Uh--

119
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,151
I'm sorry. I apologize.
I made a mistake.

120
00:10:55,251 --> 00:10:58,188
I shouldn’t have shown you this.
I'm very, very sorry.

121
00:10:58,288 --> 00:11:01,857
Listen. Particle magazine
sent me to that party to get a story.

122
00:11:01,957 --> 00:11:04,735
And this is the most exciting
thing I've ever seen.

123
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:06,060
No, no. AbsoluteIy not.

124
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,229
I'm gonna have to ask you
for that tape. Please.

125
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:09,329
You can't do that.

126
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:12,999
Don't you dare write a story. I'd never have
told any of this stuff to a journalist.

127
00:11:13,099 --> 00:11:16,768
But you did tell this stuff to a journalist.
- Yeah, I suppose I did.

128
00:11:16,868 --> 00:11:20,070
Sure did.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

129
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,572
Wait-- Come here.
What about your stocking?

130
00:11:22,672 --> 00:11:25,539
Keep it for good luck.

131
00:11:31,045 --> 00:11:33,014
I farm bits and pieces out...

132
00:11:33,114 --> 00:11:35,348
...to guys who are much more
brilliant than I am.

133
00:11:35,448 --> 00:11:38,484
I say, 'Build me a laser this.
Design me a molecular analyser that.'

134
00:11:38,584 --> 00:11:40,586
They do. End I just stick them together.

135
00:11:40,686 --> 00:11:44,923
But none of them knows what
the project really is. So--

136
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,924
Wow. End, uh, the money?

137
00:11:47,024 --> 00:11:49,426
Bartok Science Industries financed this?

138
00:11:49,526 --> 00:11:52,695
Mm-hmm. But they leave me alone
'cause I'm not expensive.

139
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:56,765
End they know they'll end up
owning it all, whatever it is. So--

140
00:11:56,865 --> 00:11:59,299
Well, that's it.

141
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,698
What do you think?

142
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:03,603
It's a joke.

143
00:12:03,703 --> 00:12:06,263
What?
- He's conning you.

144
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:09,140
It's an old nightclub routine,
the two cabinets.

145
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,367
End you fell for it.
- ...

146
00:12:11,475 --> 00:12:14,544
Wait a minute. That was no nightclub--
- Are we having lunch?

147
00:12:14,644 --> 00:12:19,744
Listen, that was no nightclub routine.
I was there. I saw it.

148
00:12:20,349 --> 00:12:22,374
Yep.

149
00:12:24,652 --> 00:12:27,621
Sure.
Send him in.

150
00:12:29,155 --> 00:12:32,924
You must have made an impression.
- What do you mean?

151
00:12:33,024 --> 00:12:35,999
Your magician has folioed you here.

152
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:41,731
I'm Stathis Borans.
I'm the editor of Particle magazine.

153
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:44,566
Uh, Seth Brundle--
- I know who you are.

154
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,936
Listen, uh, why don't
you two use my office?

155
00:12:48,036 --> 00:12:50,036
I've gotta run.

156
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:52,006
If you plan to make anything disappear...

157
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:54,106
...please let me know.

158
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:59,037
I've got an assistant editor
who's outlived his usefulness.

159
00:13:01,546 --> 00:13:03,581
You didn't waste any time.

160
00:13:03,681 --> 00:13:06,479
I'm not getting any younger.

161
00:13:08,984 --> 00:13:11,187
He didn't seem--
He wasn't impressed by your tape?

162
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:14,347
He thinks you're a con man.

163
00:13:16,623 --> 00:13:18,623
Excellent.

164
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,961
Yeah? Well, let's see what the people
at Omni think about it.

165
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:24,256
No, no, listen,
Veronica.

166
00:13:26,231 --> 00:13:28,799
I've come here to say
one magic word to you.

167
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:30,992
Yeah?

168
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:33,102
Cheeseburger.

169
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,345
I've been working alone too long.

170
00:13:42,543 --> 00:13:45,712
I have a strong urge, uh,
to talk about what I'm doing.

171
00:13:45,812 --> 00:13:49,771
But, um, if this gets out now--

172
00:13:49,882 --> 00:13:52,214
Veronica,
it'll kill me.

173
00:13:52,317 --> 00:13:55,119
The Bartok people will kill me.
My coinages will kill me.

174
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:57,449
See, it's not ready yet.

175
00:13:57,554 --> 00:14:01,491
Seems to work okay.
- No. Something import ant’s missing.

176
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:04,059
Yeah?

177
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:06,159
Yeah.

178
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:09,561
Which is?

179
00:14:11,064 --> 00:14:14,294
I can only teleport inanimate objects.

180
00:14:16,502 --> 00:14:19,003
Well, what happens when you
try to teleport living things?

181
00:14:19,103 --> 00:14:21,833
Not while we're eating.

182
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:24,464
It can't be worse than this.

183
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:30,178
Listen, you're not doing
a very good job of convincing me.

184
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:32,280
I think the word should know about it now...

185
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,681
...and I think I should be the one to tell it.

186
00:14:34,781 --> 00:14:36,840
You should tell it...

187
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,350
...but, uh, not yet.

188
00:14:39,452 --> 00:14:41,486
Look, what do you got so far?

189
00:14:41,586 --> 00:14:43,422
Enough to make you nervous.

190
00:14:43,522 --> 00:14:46,557
Why not get more?
Let me become your major project.

191
00:14:46,657 --> 00:14:48,859
I'm taking about a book,
not a magazine article.

192
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,194
Follow me and my work day by day...

193
00:14:51,294 --> 00:14:53,328
...in as much detail as you can stand.

194
00:14:53,428 --> 00:14:58,332
I don't have a life so there's
nothing for you to interfere with.

195
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:02,095
Research the background.
Cover the process.

196
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:06,372
'The compete record of the most
earth-shattering invention ever...

197
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,908
'the one that ended
all concepts of transport...

198
00:15:10,008 --> 00:15:14,003
...of borders and frontiers,
of time and space.'

199
00:15:14,945 --> 00:15:19,939
Your book will end with me
transporting myself...

200
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:22,317
...15 feet through space
from one telepod to another.

201
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:24,882
That's what's really missing.

202
00:15:26,654 --> 00:15:28,654
Wait for me that long?

203
00:16:16,224 --> 00:16:18,493
What are you doing in my apartment?

204
00:16:18,593 --> 00:16:20,494
Just happened to be in the neighbourhood.

205
00:16:20,594 --> 00:16:25,031
Felt a bit scummy.
Rough day.

206
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:32,726
Aaah. Aaah. Oh.

207
00:16:35,671 --> 00:16:37,671
How did you get in?

208
00:16:37,673 --> 00:16:40,233
Have a key, remember?

209
00:16:40,342 --> 00:16:42,342
You gave it to me.

210
00:16:42,344 --> 00:16:45,246
I knew I should have changed the lock.

211
00:16:45,346 --> 00:16:47,974
I knew you wouldn’t.
- Yeah?

212
00:16:48,081 --> 00:16:50,572
Yeah.

213
00:16:50,682 --> 00:16:54,174
That's because,
unconsciously...

214
00:16:55,253 --> 00:16:57,622
...you still want me to come back...

215
00:16:57,722 --> 00:16:59,722
...move in again.

216
00:16:59,756 --> 00:17:03,453
No. That's because,
very consciously...

217
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:05,769
I'm lazy and disorganized.

218
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:13,333
Your new playmate’s an interesting guy.

219
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:17,267
What playmates?
- The nightclub act.

220
00:17:18,803 --> 00:17:21,101
Brundle.

221
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,766
Yeah?
- Yeah.

222
00:17:25,142 --> 00:17:29,052
Yeah, I was wrong.
He's really quite brilliant.

223
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:32,481
He was the leader of the F-3-2 team.

224
00:17:32,581 --> 00:17:34,845
Remember that?

225
00:17:34,949 --> 00:17:38,817
An inch away from
the Nobel Prize for physics.

226
00:17:38,918 --> 00:17:41,213
He was only 20 at the time.

227
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,155
I don't even think I'm going to do Brundle.

228
00:17:43,255 --> 00:17:45,456
I'm still considering
the Psychology Today gig.

229
00:17:45,556 --> 00:17:47,556
That's not like you.

230
00:17:48,826 --> 00:17:51,659
Are you getting out or am I?

231
00:17:51,762 --> 00:17:53,762
I'II go.

232
00:17:53,763 --> 00:17:57,832
I have to put this issue to bed. Want me
to come back later and tuck you in?

233
00:17:57,932 --> 00:18:00,423
No. Key.

234
00:18:01,468 --> 00:18:03,468
I'II keep it...

235
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,470
...for old time's sake.

236
00:18:06,773 --> 00:18:09,606
You're a petty schmuck.

237
00:18:31,158 --> 00:18:33,649
Initiate in five seconds.

238
00:19:54,185 --> 00:19:56,121
I've got to do this, Seth.

239
00:19:56,221 --> 00:19:58,122
Talk to the tape.
Get in the habit.

240
00:19:58,222 --> 00:20:00,324
The world will want to know
what you're thinking.

241
00:20:00,424 --> 00:20:02,592
'Fuck' is what I'm thinking.

242
00:20:02,692 --> 00:20:06,685
Good. The world will want to know that.

243
00:20:08,397 --> 00:20:11,195
What else?
Why didn't it work?

244
00:20:11,298 --> 00:20:15,123
I think it, uh, turned the baboon inside out.

245
00:20:17,736 --> 00:20:20,068
Why?

246
00:20:20,172 --> 00:20:23,441
Can't deal with the flesh. It only seems
to work with inanimate objects...

247
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,666
...nothing that's living.

248
00:20:26,743 --> 00:20:28,768
Must be my fault.

249
00:20:30,012 --> 00:20:32,012
Why?

250
00:20:33,581 --> 00:20:37,851
Computers are dumb.
They only know what you tell them.

251
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:41,811
I must not know enough
about the flesh myself.

252
00:20:41,911 --> 00:20:44,206
I'm going to have to learn.

253
00:20:46,224 --> 00:20:48,349
I don't want to talk now.

254
00:21:07,507 --> 00:21:10,227
Do you ever change your clothes?

255
00:21:11,243 --> 00:21:13,404
What?

256
00:21:13,511 --> 00:21:17,931
Your clothes.
You're always wearing the same clothes.

257
00:21:19,783 --> 00:21:21,783
No. These are clean.

258
00:21:21,784 --> 00:21:24,334
I change my clothes every day.

259
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:35,861
Five sets of exactly the same clothes?

260
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,691
Learned it from Einstein.

261
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,565
This way I don't have to, um...

262
00:21:40,665 --> 00:21:42,900
...expend any thought
on what I'm going to wear.

263
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,145
I just grab the next set on the rack.

264
00:21:51,306 --> 00:21:53,672
I bought some steaks.

265
00:21:53,775 --> 00:21:55,775
Could I make you one?

266
00:21:55,776 --> 00:21:57,903
We could go out.

267
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:01,409
Cheeseburger?

268
00:22:03,482 --> 00:22:05,482
No, I-- I-- I--

269
00:22:05,484 --> 00:22:07,694
We don't have to go there.

270
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:18,851
You're very cute.
You know that?

271
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
Am I?

272
00:22:59,323 --> 00:23:01,324
Oh. Ow. Ow.
- What happened?

273
00:23:01,424 --> 00:23:04,154
My back. Ow.

274
00:23:04,261 --> 00:23:07,496
Oh. Oh, God.
Something's stuck to your back.

275
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:09,596
Well, pull it off.

276
00:23:11,566 --> 00:23:13,591
Oh. Ooh.

277
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,328
Ow.

278
00:23:17,937 --> 00:23:19,996
Sorry.
- Oh.

279
00:23:20,106 --> 00:23:23,175
Huh. I wondered what happened to this.

280
00:23:23,275 --> 00:23:25,242
Do you have any disinfectant?

281
00:23:25,342 --> 00:23:29,167
No, it's okay.
- Well, let me kiss it for you.

282
00:23:30,046 --> 00:23:34,176
Oh.
- Babe, thank you.

283
00:23:34,283 --> 00:23:36,774
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

284
00:23:36,884 --> 00:23:40,513
Sorry.
I just want to eat you up.

285
00:23:42,188 --> 00:23:46,225
You know, that's why
old ladies pinch babies' cheeks.

286
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:49,640
It's the flesh.
It just makes you crazy.

287
00:23:51,896 --> 00:23:53,921
Ronnie, Ronnie?
- Hmm?

288
00:23:58,334 --> 00:24:00,700
Want to try an experiment?

289
00:24:00,802 --> 00:24:02,802
Sure.

290
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,239
Okay.

291
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,639
Eat this. I need an objective opinion.

292
00:25:03,449 --> 00:25:07,977
Yes?
- Well, it could use some finesse...

293
00:25:08,086 --> 00:25:09,988
...but, um, it tastes like a steak.

294
00:25:10,088 --> 00:25:12,088
Oh.

295
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,790
Okay--

296
00:25:16,792 --> 00:25:19,590
Now try this teleported half.

297
00:25:19,694 --> 00:25:22,162
Are you serious? A monkey
just came apart in there.

298
00:25:22,262 --> 00:25:24,262
Baboon.
Eat.

299
00:25:27,934 --> 00:25:31,165
Ooh. Mm-- That tastes funny.

300
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:33,897
Funny how?
- It tastes, um...

301
00:25:34,005 --> 00:25:36,005
...synthetic.

302
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:41,405
Mm-hmm.
- So what have we proved?

303
00:25:42,511 --> 00:25:44,775
The computer is...

304
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,535
...giving us its interpretation of a steak.

305
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:50,484
It's, uh,
translating it for us.

306
00:25:50,584 --> 00:25:54,253
It's rethinking it rather than reproducing it...

307
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:57,489
...and something is getting lost
in the translation.

308
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,524
Me.
I'm lost.

309
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:06,461
The flesh. It should make
the computer, uh, crazy...

310
00:26:06,562 --> 00:26:08,864
...like those old ladies pinching babies.

311
00:26:08,964 --> 00:26:11,500
But it doesn't. Not yet.
I haven't taught the computer...

312
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,835
...to be made crazy by the, uh, flesh--...

313
00:26:14,935 --> 00:26:17,103
...the poetry of the steak.

314
00:26:17,203 --> 00:26:20,433
So I'm going to start teaching it now.

315
00:27:13,212 --> 00:27:16,181
####
- 

316
00:27:27,889 --> 00:27:29,889
I should have known it.

317
00:27:29,891 --> 00:27:33,418
What are you doing here?
- I folioed you.

318
00:27:34,562 --> 00:27:37,360
Psychology Today, my ass.

319
00:27:37,464 --> 00:27:39,898
You stayed with Brundle all night.

320
00:27:39,998 --> 00:27:42,500
Why didn't I believe you, I wonder?

321
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,403
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I think
he'd look great in this.

322
00:27:46,503 --> 00:27:48,503
Don't you? Hmm?

323
00:27:48,605 --> 00:27:52,974
Hmm? I mean, for your
Time magazine cover...

324
00:27:53,075 --> 00:27:54,976
...you've got to look good, right?

325
00:27:55,076 --> 00:27:59,346
Don't you get it? I'm finally onto
something that's big. Huge.

326
00:27:59,446 --> 00:28:01,573
Yeah? What, his cock?

327
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:04,959
Crude, Stathis.
Very crude.

328
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:07,611
You're too perfect to believe.

329
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:09,983
You're a goddess.

330
00:28:10,087 --> 00:28:12,923
Thank you for making my most
paranoid fantasies come true.

331
00:28:13,023 --> 00:28:15,325
I don't have to report to you, you creep.

332
00:28:15,425 --> 00:28:17,960
Ronnie, you've got to talk to me.

333
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,529
I don't have to do anything.
We're finished, remember?

334
00:28:20,629 --> 00:28:23,965
I'II spend the night
anywhere I damn well please.

335
00:28:24,065 --> 00:28:26,530
Sorry. Uh,
I'II take this too.

336
00:29:00,626 --> 00:29:03,346
I think it's time for champagne.

337
00:29:10,266 --> 00:29:13,001
Oh, God, Seth.
It's really happened.

338
00:29:13,101 --> 00:29:16,203
You did it. You’ll never
have to get carsick again.

339
00:29:16,303 --> 00:29:18,303
Or airsick or seasick.

340
00:29:18,305 --> 00:29:21,797
Mm, I know, I know.
Or tricycle-sick.

341
00:29:23,743 --> 00:29:26,007
What's next?

342
00:29:27,145 --> 00:29:29,046
Well, I'II send the baboon out for tests.

343
00:29:29,146 --> 00:29:31,248
See if he's really okay.
- How long will that take?

344
00:29:31,348 --> 00:29:33,348
Could be weeks.

345
00:29:33,449 --> 00:29:35,974
Really?

346
00:29:36,084 --> 00:29:40,578
Yeah, why?
- Well, I was thinking...

347
00:29:40,688 --> 00:29:42,990
...that we could take a holiday.

348
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,090
We could?

349
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:47,260
Yeah. You know, like an old married couple.

350
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,396
Old man's got a couple of weeks off...

351
00:29:50,496 --> 00:29:52,997
...so they go to Florida,
someplace warm.

352
00:29:53,097 --> 00:29:54,899
Just you and me?

353
00:29:54,999 --> 00:29:58,469
Yeah, why? Is there someone else
you're thinking of bringing along?

354
00:29:58,569 --> 00:30:00,569
No, no, I just, um--

355
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:05,941
Is this a romance we're having?
Is that what it is?

356
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:08,532
Yeah. It could be a romance.

357
00:30:08,642 --> 00:30:11,236
Come here.

358
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,815
I have a great idea.

359
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,255
Do you like Chinese food?

360
00:30:25,355 --> 00:30:27,448
Yes.

361
00:30:29,058 --> 00:30:33,563
We're going to have
a very romantic dinner right here.

362
00:30:37,497 --> 00:30:39,965
Hey, what's this?
- Oh, yeah.

363
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:42,467
From your editor. Sorry.
Somebody sipped it under the door.

364
00:30:42,567 --> 00:30:45,797
Hello, Victor?
Yeah, it's Seth Brundle.

365
00:30:47,171 --> 00:30:50,436
Oh, yeah, I'll wait.
- Oh, no.

366
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:53,441
What? What's that?

367
00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:01,909
Nothing. It's just, uh,
personal bullshit.

368
00:31:02,015 --> 00:31:05,051
I thought old married couples
shared all their personal bullshit.

369
00:31:05,151 --> 00:31:07,386
That's how they stayed old and married.

370
00:31:07,486 --> 00:31:09,486
Uh, listen.

371
00:31:09,587 --> 00:31:12,791
Seth, don't rush it.
- What are you taking about?

372
00:31:12,891 --> 00:31:15,793
Look, I have to go out for a few hours.
- Now? No.

373
00:31:15,893 --> 00:31:18,594
Ronnie, uh,
spicy eggplant, champagne.

374
00:31:18,694 --> 00:31:20,694
Just for a few hours.

375
00:31:20,696 --> 00:31:22,798
I still have the residue
of another life, you know.

376
00:31:22,898 --> 00:31:24,833
I have to... scrape it off my shoe...

377
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:28,163
...and get rid of it once and for all.

378
00:31:30,036 --> 00:31:32,937
Uh, hi--
- 

379
00:31:51,185 --> 00:31:52,920
What's this supposed to mean?

380
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:57,323
It means that I'm your editor, and I'm
shaping your material into a story.

381
00:31:57,423 --> 00:32:00,163
You're the one who told
me there was no story.

382
00:32:00,263 --> 00:32:02,093
You said Brundle was a con man.

383
00:32:02,193 --> 00:32:04,862
I've decided to trust
your journalistic instincts.

384
00:32:04,962 --> 00:32:07,998
Thanks very much,
but this is not your story.

385
00:32:08,098 --> 00:32:11,499
It's mine.
- Says who?

386
00:32:11,601 --> 00:32:14,870
I sent you to the Bartok party
to see what you could find.

387
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,971
Your discovery is my discovery.

388
00:32:17,071 --> 00:32:20,006
I have a lot of background on Brundle.

389
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:23,410
He's been working
on this thing for six years.

390
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:26,412
There's material out there
to find if you dig deep.

391
00:32:26,512 --> 00:32:28,776
I dug.
- Stathis--

392
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,449
Everything that has to do
with transportation will become obsolete.

393
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:34,818
And I am right there in the middle of it...

394
00:32:34,918 --> 00:32:37,353
...the only recorder
of the event from the inside out.

395
00:32:37,453 --> 00:32:39,453
Okay.

396
00:32:41,623 --> 00:32:43,623
Okay.

397
00:32:45,326 --> 00:32:49,922
Look, uh-- Just keep me informed, all right?

398
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:52,293
As a friend?

399
00:32:52,397 --> 00:32:54,777
As a professional confidant?

400
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
That's all?

401
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:04,325
I don't want you to disappear from my life.

402
00:33:09,644 --> 00:33:11,644
Okay.

403
00:33:14,647 --> 00:33:16,911
What about sex?

404
00:33:17,016 --> 00:33:20,218
I'm not saying love or affection,
just stress-relieving sex.

405
00:33:20,318 --> 00:33:22,318
You and me.

406
00:33:23,687 --> 00:33:27,214
You're disgusting,
as always.

407
00:33:30,158 --> 00:33:32,728
Wouldn’t want to disappoint you.

408
00:33:32,828 --> 00:33:36,924
'Residue' means
her old boyfriend, doesn't it?

409
00:33:38,965 --> 00:33:42,526
Stathis Borans is her old boyfriend.

410
00:33:42,634 --> 00:33:45,865
'From the desk of Stathis Borans.'

411
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:48,539
How about, 'Under the desk
of Stathis Borans'?

412
00:33:48,639 --> 00:33:50,741
She's working for her old boyfriend.

413
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:53,076
Now she runs out late at night to see him.

414
00:33:53,176 --> 00:33:55,641
What is this,
the Ronnie game?

415
00:33:59,214 --> 00:34:01,934
I'm catching on.
I'm catching on.

416
00:34:03,183 --> 00:34:05,952
I didn't mean to kill your brother.

417
00:34:06,052 --> 00:34:09,755
But he didn't die in vain,
if that's of any comfort. End--

418
00:34:09,855 --> 00:34:12,016
As the general said...

419
00:34:12,124 --> 00:34:17,394
'There's nothing I'd ask you to do
that I wouldn’t do myself, boys.'

420
00:34:17,494 --> 00:34:20,019
Hey, you're all right.

421
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:23,785
From looking at you,
I can tell you're okay.

422
00:34:26,734 --> 00:34:29,794
What are we waiting for?
Let's do it.

423
00:36:07,576 --> 00:36:09,669
How you doing?

424
00:36:09,778 --> 00:36:12,178
Now, you tell me...

425
00:36:12,279 --> 00:36:14,679
...am I different somehow?

426
00:36:14,781 --> 00:36:17,841
Is it live,
or is it Memorex?

427
00:36:19,518 --> 00:36:22,068
It's too bad Ronnie missed it.

428
00:37:22,293 --> 00:37:24,693
I missed you last night.

429
00:37:24,795 --> 00:37:27,696
It's still night.
I came back.

430
00:37:27,798 --> 00:37:30,518
You had to celebrate without me.

431
00:37:30,566 --> 00:37:32,830
I'm sorry.

432
00:37:32,934 --> 00:37:35,144
I went through last night.

433
00:37:36,303 --> 00:37:38,303
You went through?

434
00:37:38,305 --> 00:37:40,600
Without testing the baboon?

435
00:37:42,342 --> 00:37:45,743
I was... drunk.
I was a bit upset.

436
00:37:46,845 --> 00:37:49,480
You could have killed yourself.

437
00:37:57,019 --> 00:38:00,182
Are you sleeping with Stathis Borans?

438
00:38:00,288 --> 00:38:02,583
What are you taking about?

439
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:06,567
I-- I don't know. I just,
um, get that feeling.

440
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:12,096
That's why you were upset?

441
00:38:13,698 --> 00:38:15,698
I got jealous.

442
00:38:17,001 --> 00:38:19,526
Oh, God. Seth...

443
00:38:19,636 --> 00:38:22,356
...you don't have to be jealous.

444
00:38:22,805 --> 00:38:24,805
He's an old boyfriend.

445
00:38:24,873 --> 00:38:27,508
He was teaching at college.
I was a science major.

446
00:38:27,608 --> 00:38:30,328
He got me started in journalism.

447
00:38:31,211 --> 00:38:33,676
Is he still in love with you?

448
00:38:34,714 --> 00:38:37,046
How could he not be?

449
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:43,177
Hey, what about our deal?

450
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,789
You went through,
and I wasn't there.

451
00:38:45,889 --> 00:38:48,687
Don't worry.
I taped it for you.

452
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:50,791
You did?

453
00:43:55,685 --> 00:43:58,188
So, I asked the computer
if it had improved me.

454
00:43:58,288 --> 00:44:00,389
It said it didn't know
what I was taking about.

455
00:44:00,489 --> 00:44:03,158
That's made me think carefully about
what I've been feeling and why.

456
00:44:03,258 --> 00:44:06,827
I'm beginning to think the sheer process
of being taken apart atom by atom...

457
00:44:06,927 --> 00:44:08,896
...and put back together again--

458
00:44:08,996 --> 00:44:12,698
It's like coffee being put through a filter.
It's somehow a purifying process.

459
00:44:12,798 --> 00:44:15,167
It's purified me. It's cleansed me.
And I'II tell you...

460
00:44:15,267 --> 00:44:17,836
I think it's going to allow me to realize...

461
00:44:17,936 --> 00:44:21,372
...the personal potential
I've been neglecting all these years...

462
00:44:21,472 --> 00:44:25,775
...that I've been obsessively pursuing
goal after goal.

463
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:27,776
Do you normally take
coffee with your sugar?

464
00:44:27,876 --> 00:44:30,401
What? Oh.

465
00:44:30,511 --> 00:44:34,347
You know, I just don't think
I've ever given me a chance to be me.

466
00:44:34,447 --> 00:44:36,349
But, of course, interestingly...

467
00:44:36,449 --> 00:44:38,050
...at the exact moment that I achieved...

468
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:39,952
...what'll probably prove
to be my life's work...

469
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,720
...that's the moment when I started
being the real me finally.

470
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:46,220
So, uh, listen-- Not to wax messianic...

471
00:44:46,223 --> 00:44:49,126
...but it may be true that
the synchronicity of those two events...

472
00:44:49,226 --> 00:44:51,861
...might blur the resultant individual effect
of either individuality.

473
00:44:51,961 --> 00:44:55,564
But it is, uh, nevertheless
also certainly true...

474
00:44:55,664 --> 00:44:57,731
I will say now however subjectively...

475
00:44:57,831 --> 00:45:02,101
...that human teleportation-- molecular
decimation, breakdown and reformation--...

476
00:45:02,201 --> 00:45:04,804
...is inherently purging--
it makes a man a king.

477
00:45:04,904 --> 00:45:07,673
From the moment I walked out,
I felt like a million bucks.

478
00:45:07,773 --> 00:45:10,041
I think I am gonna have a cannoli after all.

479
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:12,677
Waiter. I mean,
w-what an accomplishment.

480
00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:16,079
But what have I really done?
AII I've done is say to the word...

481
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:18,881
'Let's go. Move.
Catch me if you can.'

482
00:45:18,981 --> 00:45:21,882
Waiter. Jesus Christ.
- 

483
00:45:34,593 --> 00:45:36,593
Oh, God. Wait.

484
00:45:36,594 --> 00:45:39,085
What?
- Uh-- Oh, God.

485
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:43,730
What?

486
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:46,063
How can you keep going?

487
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:50,905
You can't have any--
have any fluid left in your body.

488
00:45:51,005 --> 00:45:53,106
We've been doing this for hours.

489
00:45:53,206 --> 00:45:55,586
I-I'm not ready to quit yet.

490
00:45:55,642 --> 00:45:57,837
Come on.
- Oh--...

491
00:45:57,943 --> 00:45:59,943
Come on.
- Oh--

492
00:46:03,381 --> 00:46:06,680
Mm. Hey. What's this?

493
00:46:06,783 --> 00:46:08,918
It's an attempt to distract me,
that's what it is.

494
00:46:09,018 --> 00:46:11,018
No, really,
what is it?

495
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:14,080
It's like...
hairs or something.

496
00:46:14,189 --> 00:46:16,555
I don't know.
It's, uh--

497
00:46:16,657 --> 00:46:19,226
It happens when you get older.
Weird hair configurations.

498
00:46:19,326 --> 00:46:22,022
They're really coarse.

499
00:46:22,128 --> 00:46:24,062
Well, I've never really been hairy enough.

500
00:46:24,162 --> 00:46:27,331
You know what I mean?
Airways too boyish.

501
00:46:27,431 --> 00:46:30,067
I'm Looking forward to a hairy body.

502
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:33,236
It's one of the compensations of old age.
Come here. Where are you going?

503
00:46:33,336 --> 00:46:35,336
Let me go.

504
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:38,639
You're let go.

505
00:47:06,061 --> 00:47:08,629
Hey, hey, hey. Not my new hairs.
What are you doing?

506
00:47:08,729 --> 00:47:10,729
Relax, Brundle.

507
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:13,667
I don't really think you want a body
covered with these.

508
00:47:13,767 --> 00:47:17,464
God.. They're really tough.

509
00:47:20,138 --> 00:47:22,139
Listen. I want you to go through.

510
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:24,274
I want to teleport you as soon as possible.

511
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:26,275
Right now.
You’ll feel incredible.

512
00:47:26,375 --> 00:47:29,078
Ronnie, I hardily need to sleep anymore
and I feel wonderful.

513
00:47:29,178 --> 00:47:31,546
It's like a drug, but a perfectly
pure and benign drug.

514
00:47:31,646 --> 00:47:33,548
The power I feel surging inside me--

515
00:47:33,648 --> 00:47:36,784
I won't wear you out. We'll be
the perfect couple. The dynamic duo.

516
00:47:36,884 --> 00:47:38,785
Come on. Right now.
- Hey, wait.

517
00:47:38,885 --> 00:47:40,136
Don't give me that born-again...

518
00:47:40,236 --> 00:47:42,220
...teleportation rap. I told
you I'm scared to do it.

519
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:46,060
W-What do I have to say?
I'm not gonna do it.

520
00:47:46,662 --> 00:47:49,722
You're a fucking drag,
you know that.

521
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:53,305
Something went wrong, Seth.

522
00:47:53,405 --> 00:47:57,060
When you went through,
something went wrong.

523
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:05,353
No? If not you,
if you're too chickenshit...

524
00:48:05,453 --> 00:48:08,358
...to be a member of
the dynamic duo club, okay, then great.

525
00:48:08,458 --> 00:48:11,629
I'II find somebody else,
somebody who can keep up with me.

526
00:48:11,729 --> 00:48:13,531
Seth, you have to listen to me.

527
00:48:13,631 --> 00:48:16,002
You're afraid to dive
into the plasma pool, aren't you?

528
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:18,371
You're afraid to be
destroyed and recreated, aren't you?

529
00:48:18,471 --> 00:48:21,242
I'II bet you think you woke me up
about the flesh, don't you?

530
00:48:21,342 --> 00:48:24,846
But you only know society's
straight line about the flesh.

531
00:48:24,946 --> 00:48:29,820
You can't penetrate beyond
society's sick, gray fear of the flesh.

532
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,691
Drink deep or taste not the plasma spring.

533
00:48:32,791 --> 00:48:34,791
See what I'm saying?

534
00:48:34,794 --> 00:48:36,930
I'm not just taking about
sex and penetration.

535
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:40,135
I'm taking about penetration
beyond the veil of the flesh--...

536
00:48:40,235 --> 00:48:44,315
...a deep, penetrating dive
into the plasma pool.

537
00:49:12,311 --> 00:49:14,506
####

538
00:49:27,198 --> 00:49:29,666
I'II have a scotch.

539
00:49:31,237 --> 00:49:33,237
Who's winning?

540
00:49:34,909 --> 00:49:38,310
I don't know.
I hope it's Marky.

541
00:49:41,451 --> 00:49:43,476
How come?
- Because...

542
00:49:43,587 --> 00:49:45,587
I like Marky tonight.

543
00:49:45,657 --> 00:49:47,818
Well, I like you tonight.

544
00:49:47,926 --> 00:49:51,496
Maybe I'd better get involved in this too.

545
00:49:54,068 --> 00:49:56,104
Hey, pal,
you're disturbing us.

546
00:49:56,204 --> 00:50:00,454
I got 1 00 bucks says
I can beat either one of you.

547
00:50:03,147 --> 00:50:05,147
Take a hike, asshole.

548
00:50:05,184 --> 00:50:07,184
Here.

549
00:50:08,521 --> 00:50:11,115
Here's my 1 00...

550
00:50:11,225 --> 00:50:13,795
...and I take the lady home
for the night if I win.

551
00:50:13,895 --> 00:50:17,422
Says who? Do I look like a hooker to you?

552
00:50:17,533 --> 00:50:23,228
Hey, Tawny, it's an easy 1 00.
Come on, pal. Let's get it over with.

553
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:27,280
Better watch out.
He eats chocolate bars.

554
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,380
Yeah, so I noticed.

555
00:50:35,992 --> 00:50:39,052
I don't think he has a chance.

556
00:51:13,342 --> 00:51:16,140
My arm.

557
00:51:17,782 --> 00:51:17,949
Are you a bodybuilder or something?

558
00:51:18,049 --> 00:51:20,019
Are you a bodybuilder or something?

559
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:23,823
Yeah, I build bodies. I take them apart,
then I put them back together again.

560
00:51:23,923 --> 00:51:26,824
Well, you sure took Marky apart.

561
00:51:26,927 --> 00:51:29,898
Let's go back to my place.
- Your place?

562
00:51:29,998 --> 00:51:33,236
Yeah, well, okay. I live
with my mother anyway.

563
00:51:33,336 --> 00:51:36,273
But, uh, can we go to
maybe a few more bars first?

564
00:51:36,373 --> 00:51:38,543
I mean, it's a little too early to quit.

565
00:51:38,643 --> 00:51:40,643
Sure, a few more bars.

566
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:08,813
Great place.

567
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:10,918
Hey.

568
00:52:16,562 --> 00:52:18,894
There's no elevator.

569
00:52:18,998 --> 00:52:22,568
I can't make it.
- No, there's an elevator.

570
00:52:24,706 --> 00:52:27,903
There. Don't you feel elevated?
- 

571
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:31,847
Whoa.

572
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:38,851
Oh.

573
00:52:38,959 --> 00:52:41,018
Ooh.

574
00:52:41,129 --> 00:52:43,154
Ooh..

575
00:53:07,764 --> 00:53:09,764
Wow.

576
00:53:17,813 --> 00:53:20,363
Are you some sort of magician?

577
00:53:24,888 --> 00:53:26,888
Yes.

578
00:53:37,805 --> 00:53:40,501
Ahhh.

579
00:53:44,415 --> 00:53:48,044
Ooh.
- 

580
00:53:53,694 --> 00:53:56,839
So? Are we going to breakfast or not?

581
00:53:59,168 --> 00:54:02,262
It's your turn.
- To do what?

582
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:04,675
I want you to go through.
- No.

583
00:54:04,775 --> 00:54:08,214
I don't want to try that.
- Why not? It'll make you feel sexy.

584
00:54:08,314 --> 00:54:11,613
But I already feel sexy.

585
00:54:11,719 --> 00:54:17,624
How 'bout...
a nice alcohol rub?

586
00:54:17,727 --> 00:54:21,925
Don't do that.
It hurts.

587
00:54:22,032 --> 00:54:24,227
Sorry, hon.

588
00:54:24,335 --> 00:54:27,908
I didn't know you had
the skin of a princess.

589
00:54:28,008 --> 00:54:29,976
You're real sensitive, huh?
- Okay, okay.

590
00:54:30,076 --> 00:54:32,112
That's it.
You're going to like it.

591
00:54:32,212 --> 00:54:34,283
I don't want to.
I'm afraid.

592
00:54:34,383 --> 00:54:36,383
Don't be afraid.
- No.

593
00:54:36,385 --> 00:54:40,014
Be afraid.
Be very afraid.

594
00:54:40,123 --> 00:54:42,284
Who's this?

595
00:54:42,394 --> 00:54:45,264
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
I live with my mother too.

596
00:54:45,364 --> 00:54:47,364
mum, meet Tawny.

597
00:54:48,936 --> 00:54:50,936
I gotta go.

598
00:54:55,544 --> 00:54:57,924
Thanks for a wonderful time.

599
00:55:07,127 --> 00:55:10,563
Why'd you scare her off? Jealous?

600
00:55:10,665 --> 00:55:14,123
You're changing, Seth.

601
00:55:14,236 --> 00:55:16,607
Everything about you is changing.

602
00:55:16,707 --> 00:55:19,039
You look bad.

603
00:55:19,142 --> 00:55:21,142
You smell bad.

604
00:55:21,213 --> 00:55:24,018
I've never been much of a bather.

605
00:55:25,987 --> 00:55:30,325
Those... weird hairs that were growing
out of your back, I took them to a lab.

606
00:55:30,425 --> 00:55:32,425
I had them analysed.

607
00:55:35,766 --> 00:55:38,166
The hairs?

608
00:55:39,371 --> 00:55:41,371
The hairs?

609
00:55:41,474 --> 00:55:44,789
Oh. Yeah, that's a strange thing to do.

610
00:55:44,845 --> 00:55:47,609
Not as strange as the results.

611
00:55:47,715 --> 00:55:50,920
The guy at the lab
had trouble identifying them.

612
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:52,989
He finally came to the conclusion...

613
00:55:53,089 --> 00:55:54,992
...that they were definitely not human.

614
00:55:55,092 --> 00:55:57,492
Oh. Very good.

615
00:55:57,596 --> 00:56:00,326
Not human, Seth.

616
00:56:00,433 --> 00:56:04,460
In fact, very likely insect hairs.

617
00:56:04,571 --> 00:56:06,641
That's silly.
That's ridiculous.

618
00:56:06,741 --> 00:56:10,871
Look. Now there's more.
Uh, look at your face.

619
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:13,184
Something happened
when you went through, Seth.

620
00:56:13,284 --> 00:56:16,422
You've got to get some help.
I think you must be sick.

621
00:56:16,522 --> 00:56:18,888
You're jealous.

622
00:56:21,162 --> 00:56:24,299
I've become free.
I've been released, and you can't stand it.

623
00:56:24,399 --> 00:56:26,602
You’ll do anything to bring me down.

624
00:56:26,702 --> 00:56:32,652
Look at me. Does this look sick?
Does this look like a sick man to you?

625
00:56:33,011 --> 00:56:35,022
No. Stop it.
- Do you know any sick men...

626
00:56:35,122 --> 00:56:36,616
...who can do that? Come here.

627
00:56:36,716 --> 00:56:39,720
No. Seth.
- Deal's off. I don't need you anymore.

628
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:43,881
No, wait. Seth, please.
Wait. Seth.

629
00:56:43,992 --> 00:56:46,256
Don't come back.

630
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,361
Oh, God.

631
00:56:57,677 --> 00:56:59,975
Oh, God.

632
00:57:00,081 --> 00:57:03,778
Oh. Oh, God.

633
00:57:03,886 --> 00:57:05,886
Oh, God.

634
00:57:42,972 --> 00:57:44,972
Ow.

635
00:59:01,212 --> 00:59:03,212
Oh, no.

636
00:59:04,549 --> 00:59:07,518
What's happening to me?
Am I dying?

637
00:59:09,323 --> 00:59:12,292
Is this how it starts?
Am I dying?

638
00:59:14,597 --> 00:59:17,691
Brundle, Seth.

639
00:59:17,801 --> 00:59:20,133
Give me a disk.

640
00:59:20,238 --> 00:59:24,148
Uh, I need the first teleportation, S. Brundle.

641
00:59:58,957 --> 01:00:00,957
Run sequence.

642
01:01:54,213 --> 01:01:56,213
Hello.

643
01:01:59,154 --> 01:02:01,154
Seth.

644
01:02:02,825 --> 01:02:06,864
Seth, I've been trying
to reach you. Where are you?

645
01:02:06,964 --> 01:02:10,069
For the last four weeks,
I've been afraid to see you.

646
01:02:10,169 --> 01:02:13,434
Now, I'm...
afraid not to.

647
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:15,443
Where are you?
Are you at home?

648
01:02:15,543 --> 01:02:17,745
Veronica, you don't know
how right you were.

649
01:02:17,845 --> 01:02:22,782
I've gotten...
much, much worse.

650
01:02:22,886 --> 01:02:27,323
Please come to see me.
Please come now.

651
01:02:51,825 --> 01:02:55,090
Seth? I'm here.

652
01:02:55,197 --> 01:02:57,197
Stop.

653
01:02:58,468 --> 01:03:00,468
Seth.

654
01:03:03,174 --> 01:03:05,233
You were right.

655
01:03:05,344 --> 01:03:10,304
I'm diseased and, uh,
might be contagious somehow.

656
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:16,556
I wouldn’t want to infect you.

657
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:19,321
And it's been accelerating.

658
01:03:19,429 --> 01:03:22,968
It's unrelenting. Every day
there are... changes.

659
01:03:23,068 --> 01:03:26,139
Every time I look in the mirror there's
someone different, hideous, repulsive.

660
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:27,908
What happened?

661
01:03:28,008 --> 01:03:32,146
# I know an old lady who swallowed a fly
Perhaps she'll die ##

662
01:03:32,246 --> 01:03:34,578
Seth, please.

663
01:03:36,686 --> 01:03:41,760
I was not pure. The teleporter insisted
on inner purity. I was not pure.

664
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:44,624
I don't know what you mean.

665
01:03:47,534 --> 01:03:49,695
A fly...

666
01:03:49,804 --> 01:03:56,179
...got into the... transmitter pod with me
that first time when I was alone.

667
01:03:58,483 --> 01:04:01,782
Uh, the computer...
got confused.

668
01:04:01,888 --> 01:04:04,390
There weren't supposed
to be two separate genetic patterns...

669
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:08,290
...and it decided to, uh,
spIice us together.

670
01:04:08,396 --> 01:04:10,796
It mated us,
me and the fly.

671
01:04:10,899 --> 01:04:14,299
We hadn't even been properly introduced.

672
01:04:16,974 --> 01:04:21,673
My teleporter turned her
into a gene splicer...

673
01:04:21,781 --> 01:04:26,541
...a very good one, and now I'm not
Seth Brundle anymore.

674
01:04:26,587 --> 01:04:29,891
I'm the offspring of Brundle and housefly.

675
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:32,585
Oh, God.

676
01:04:32,696 --> 01:04:35,187
No.
- Oh, God. Seth.

677
01:04:35,299 --> 01:04:37,299
You look so pretty.

678
01:04:37,369 --> 01:04:39,369
What will happen?

679
01:04:39,438 --> 01:04:42,376
Oh, I think it's showing itself
as a bizarre form of cancer...

680
01:04:42,476 --> 01:04:46,447
Oh, no.
- and general celluIar chaos and revolution.

681
01:04:46,547 --> 01:04:48,617
I'm, uh, just going to have to disintegrate.

682
01:04:48,717 --> 01:04:52,744
In a novel way, no doubt.
And then I'II die.

683
01:04:52,857 --> 01:04:56,418
And then it’ll be over.
- No, no, no.

684
01:04:56,528 --> 01:04:58,965
I don't accept that.
There must be something we can do...

685
01:04:59,065 --> 01:05:01,267
...somebody we can go to,
tests that can be done.

686
01:05:01,367 --> 01:05:06,134
No. Um, I won't be just
another tumorous bore...

687
01:05:06,241 --> 01:05:10,414
...taking endlessly about his... hair
failing out and his lost lymph nodes.

688
01:05:10,514 --> 01:05:14,849
Then what do you want me to do?
Why did you call me?

689
01:05:24,833 --> 01:05:27,563
Oh.

690
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:32,468
Oh, that-- that's disgusting.

691
01:05:33,678 --> 01:05:35,908
Uh.

692
01:05:42,758 --> 01:05:46,626
My... ear. No.

693
01:05:48,131 --> 01:05:50,258
I'm scared.

694
01:05:52,437 --> 01:05:54,437
Help me.

695
01:05:55,676 --> 01:05:58,645
Please. Please help me.

696
01:06:06,456 --> 01:06:08,159
Don't go back to him.

697
01:06:08,259 --> 01:06:11,956
That's it?
That's your advice?

698
01:06:12,064 --> 01:06:14,067
He's right, don't you see?
It could be contagious.

699
01:06:14,167 --> 01:06:17,204
It could turn into an epidemic.
- I have to go back to him.

700
01:06:17,304 --> 01:06:18,907
I don't believe this.

701
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:21,498
If you saw him, Stathis--...

702
01:06:21,611 --> 01:06:24,815
...if you saw how scared and angry
and desperate he is--

703
01:06:24,915 --> 01:06:27,040
I'm sure Typhoid Mary
was a nice person too...

704
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:28,319
...when you saw her socially.

705
01:06:28,419 --> 01:06:31,690
Listen, I do not want you going--
- I don't care what you want.

706
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:33,790
AII right, fine.

707
01:06:46,144 --> 01:06:49,081
Do I have permission to claim your body
when this is all over?

708
01:06:49,181 --> 01:06:51,649
Oh, God.

709
01:06:54,821 --> 01:06:56,821
Look, how about this?

710
01:06:59,361 --> 01:07:03,627
You say if only I saw him.
Show me.

711
01:07:03,734 --> 01:07:06,567
Tape him. Show me.

712
01:07:06,672 --> 01:07:09,140
Let me think about it.

713
01:07:11,077 --> 01:07:14,046
I'II come up with something.

714
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:42,150
Seth?

715
01:07:48,195 --> 01:07:51,028
Seth?
- No, no. Up here.

716
01:07:51,132 --> 01:07:53,132
Oh.

717
01:07:54,903 --> 01:07:57,474
Gotten pretty good at it,
haven't I?

718
01:07:57,574 --> 01:08:00,702
Yeah, it's almost second nature.
- 

719
01:08:00,812 --> 01:08:02,852
Stopped biting my nails.

720
01:08:08,323 --> 01:08:10,292
Oh, look at this.
What's this?

721
01:08:10,392 --> 01:08:12,656
I don't know.

722
01:08:16,566 --> 01:08:22,261
I seem to be stricken by a disease
with a purpose, wouldn’t you say?

723
01:08:24,577 --> 01:08:27,816
Maybe not such a...
bad disease after all.

724
01:08:27,916 --> 01:08:29,916
I can't stay here.

725
01:08:29,985 --> 01:08:32,146
No, no, no.

726
01:08:32,254 --> 01:08:34,950
Why not?
Why can't you?

727
01:08:35,059 --> 01:08:37,027
I can't take it.
It's too much.

728
01:08:37,127 --> 01:08:39,832
What's there to take?
The disease has just revealed its purpose.

729
01:08:39,932 --> 01:08:42,402
We don't have to worry
about contagion anymore.

730
01:08:42,502 --> 01:08:46,274
I know what the disease wants.
- What does the disease want?

731
01:08:46,374 --> 01:08:50,140
It wants to... turn me into something else.

732
01:08:50,245 --> 01:08:52,215
That's not too terrible, is it?

733
01:08:52,315 --> 01:08:55,119
Most people would give anything
to be turned into something else.

734
01:08:55,219 --> 01:08:58,123
Turned into what?
- What do you think, a fly?

735
01:08:58,223 --> 01:09:00,460
Am I becoming a 1 85-pound fly?

736
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:04,064
No, I'm becoming something
that never existed before.

737
01:09:04,164 --> 01:09:06,689
I'm becoming Brundlefly.

738
01:09:06,802 --> 01:09:09,906
Don't you think that's worth
a Nobel Prize or two?

739
01:09:10,006 --> 01:09:12,133
Here.

740
01:09:13,511 --> 01:09:16,776
I want to give a demonstration...

741
01:09:16,882 --> 01:09:22,582
...that I think you'll want to,
uh, record for posterity.

742
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:24,993
I think you must chronicle...

743
01:09:25,093 --> 01:09:28,231
...the life and times of
Brundlefly, don't you?

744
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:32,704
At the very least, it should make
a fabulous children’s book.

745
01:09:32,804 --> 01:09:34,804
You seem tired.

746
01:09:36,709 --> 01:09:39,041
You got me there?

747
01:09:43,384 --> 01:09:45,511
How does Brundlefly eat?

748
01:09:45,622 --> 01:09:49,660
He found out the hard and painful way
that he eats much the way a fly eats.

749
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,896
His teeth are now useless because...

750
01:09:51,996 --> 01:09:55,268
...although he can chew up solid food,
he can't digest it.

751
01:09:55,368 --> 01:09:58,360
Solid food hurts.
So, like a fly...

752
01:09:58,471 --> 01:10:03,465
Brundlefly breaks down solids
with a corrosive enzyme...

753
01:10:03,579 --> 01:10:05,649
...playfully called vomit drop.

754
01:10:05,749 --> 01:10:08,720
He regurgitates on his food, it liquefies...

755
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:11,422
...and then he sucks it back up.

756
01:10:11,522 --> 01:10:14,320
Ready for a demonstration, kids?

757
01:10:14,426 --> 01:10:16,426
Here goes.

758
01:10:16,497 --> 01:10:19,728
Oh, my God.

759
01:10:20,769 --> 01:10:24,000
My God.

760
01:10:30,515 --> 01:10:32,813
Hey, Ronnie?
- 

761
01:10:35,388 --> 01:10:37,388
Ronnie?

762
01:10:45,401 --> 01:10:48,199
What is it?

763
01:10:53,479 --> 01:10:55,479
I'm pregnant.

764
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:58,018
Oh, no.

765
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:03,349
Oh, no.

766
01:11:05,162 --> 01:11:07,712
I'm pregnant with Seth's baby.

767
01:11:16,044 --> 01:11:18,569
What do you want to do?

768
01:11:20,616 --> 01:11:23,141
I don't know.

769
01:11:25,056 --> 01:11:28,287
I just-- I don't know.

770
01:11:55,798 --> 01:11:57,798
Stathis, I'm scared.

771
01:11:57,867 --> 01:12:00,170
It's going to be all right, Ronnie.

772
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:02,270
It's going to be fine.

773
01:12:02,341 --> 01:12:04,309
I don't think I want to lose it.

774
01:12:04,409 --> 01:12:07,113
Is there something wrong with me?
Why am I losing it?

775
01:12:07,213 --> 01:12:10,218
It's better this way,
Ronnie. You’ll see.

776
01:12:10,318 --> 01:12:12,988
It's the best thing that could happen.

777
01:12:13,088 --> 01:12:15,057
She's expelling it.
It's coming out.

778
01:12:15,157 --> 01:12:17,527
I don't even think
we're gonna have to go in.

779
01:12:17,627 --> 01:12:21,427
Oh.
- It's gonna be easy. Don't worry, honey.

780
01:12:21,533 --> 01:12:22,533
No. Please, no.

781
01:12:22,633 --> 01:12:25,505
Yeah, there's no problem. It'll be over soon.

782
01:12:25,605 --> 01:12:28,369
Here we go. Okay.

783
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:36,016
Just a little suction here,
a little suction.

784
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:40,091
Suction. Hod it. Hold on a minute.
There's more in there.

785
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:44,184
There's more?
- Yeah. I mean, a lot more.

786
01:12:44,297 --> 01:12:47,335
Okay. You're gonna have to help us.
Come on. You can push.

787
01:12:47,435 --> 01:12:49,338
You can push it out.
Come on.

788
01:12:49,438 --> 01:12:51,340
Oh.
- Push. That's it. Come on.

789
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,343
Push. Use those muscles. That's it.
- No, wait.

790
01:12:53,443 --> 01:12:56,447
Give us a push.
You can push it out. That's it.

791
01:12:56,547 --> 01:12:58,449
Come on.
- No, wait. Wait. No.

792
01:12:58,549 --> 01:13:00,549
You can do it.
- Oh.

793
01:13:00,553 --> 01:13:02,188
Wait. Oh.

794
01:13:02,288 --> 01:13:04,347
Oh. No.

795
01:13:07,896 --> 01:13:11,388
Oh.. No.. Oh.. Oh..

796
01:14:14,653 --> 01:14:16,814
Oh.

797
01:14:16,923 --> 01:14:19,795
I want a disk. Give me
preliminary integration.

798
01:14:19,895 --> 01:14:23,922
I want a disk.
Give me preliminary integration.

799
01:14:24,032 --> 01:14:26,503
I want a disk.
Give me preliminary integration.

800
01:14:26,603 --> 01:14:30,664
I want a disk. Give me
preliminary integration.

801
01:15:07,058 --> 01:15:11,188
You're relics. Yes, you are.
You can't deny it.

802
01:15:11,296 --> 01:15:16,063
Vestigial,
archaeological, redundant.

803
01:15:19,374 --> 01:15:24,209
Artefacts of a bygone era,
of historical interest only.

804
01:15:46,478 --> 01:15:49,675
You've missed some good moments.

805
01:15:49,783 --> 01:15:52,843
Is that why you're here,
to catch up?

806
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,360
I wanted--

807
01:16:05,003 --> 01:16:08,905
My teeth have begun to fall out.

808
01:16:09,009 --> 01:16:13,014
The medicine cabinet's now
the Brundle Museum of Natural History.

809
01:16:13,114 --> 01:16:16,514
You want to see what else is in it?
- No.

810
01:16:19,022 --> 01:16:21,022
Then...

811
01:16:22,026 --> 01:16:24,551
...what do you want?

812
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:30,534
I... came to tell you...

813
01:16:30,638 --> 01:16:32,638
...um--

814
01:16:33,642 --> 01:16:36,873
I, uh-- I just--

815
01:16:38,482 --> 01:16:41,451
I wanted to s-see you...

816
01:16:41,553 --> 01:16:43,553
...before--

817
01:16:52,101 --> 01:16:55,229
You have to leave now...

818
01:16:55,338 --> 01:16:57,718
...and never come back here.

819
01:17:02,013 --> 01:17:05,328
Have you ever heard of insect poetics?

820
01:17:08,155 --> 01:17:12,182
Neither have I.

821
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:17,254
Insects... don't have poetics.

822
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:22,367
They're very brutal.

823
01:17:22,475 --> 01:17:26,377
No compassion,
no compromise.

824
01:17:27,482 --> 01:17:30,383
We can't trust the insect.

825
01:17:32,688 --> 01:17:38,593
I'd like to become...
the first insect politician.

826
01:17:40,032 --> 01:17:43,160
You see, I'd like to,
um, but...

827
01:17:43,270 --> 01:17:46,068
...oh, I'm afraid, um--

828
01:17:47,208 --> 01:17:50,523
I don't know what you're trying to say.

829
01:17:50,781 --> 01:17:53,249
I'm saying--

830
01:17:58,191 --> 01:18:03,322
I'm saying I'm an insect...

831
01:18:04,432 --> 01:18:08,266
...who dreamt he was a man and loved it.

832
01:18:08,370 --> 01:18:10,750
But now the dream is over...

833
01:18:10,807 --> 01:18:12,710
...and the insect is awake.

834
01:18:12,810 --> 01:18:16,007
No, no. No, Seth.

835
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:19,918
I'm saying...

836
01:18:22,057 --> 01:18:24,525
I'II hurt you if you stay.

837
01:18:46,923 --> 01:18:49,983
No. No.

838
01:18:51,696 --> 01:18:53,857
No.

839
01:19:01,143 --> 01:19:03,611
No.

840
01:19:03,713 --> 01:19:05,782
Let's go. Let's do it now.

841
01:19:05,882 --> 01:19:09,367
Now? Wait. Wait a minute.
What did he say?

842
01:19:09,387 --> 01:19:11,387
I couldn’t tell him.

843
01:19:11,456 --> 01:19:13,567
Let's go, damn it.
- No.

844
01:19:13,726 --> 01:19:17,064
We should wait for a few days. I don't think
you're in the right state of mind--

845
01:19:17,164 --> 01:19:20,636
No. Now. I want it out of my body now.
You should have seen him.

846
01:19:20,736 --> 01:19:22,972
There could be anything in here.
In me. In my body.

847
01:19:23,072 --> 01:19:25,676
I don't know if I can
arrange it right now, tonight.

848
01:19:25,776 --> 01:19:28,414
Why do we have to run around
in the dark like a couple of--...

849
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:30,716
'Cause I don't want it in my body.
You understand me?

850
01:19:30,816 --> 01:19:33,250
I don't want it in my body.

851
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:10,658
Well, okay.
What's the story?

852
01:20:12,873 --> 01:20:15,177
She's pregnant,
and she wants to have an abortion.

853
01:20:15,277 --> 01:20:17,572
In the middle of the night?

854
01:20:19,249 --> 01:20:21,686
We have good reason to think that...

855
01:20:21,786 --> 01:20:25,483
...this... chid will be deformed.

856
01:20:25,591 --> 01:20:29,926
Yeah, but in the middle of the night?
- Look, Brent.

857
01:20:30,064 --> 01:20:32,064
Please.

858
01:20:34,169 --> 01:20:37,297
Is it your child?
- No.

859
01:20:37,407 --> 01:20:39,407
It's the--

860
01:20:40,644 --> 01:20:44,978
It's the chid of...
a man who is deformed.

861
01:20:46,219 --> 01:20:48,188
Listen, I don't mean to interfere...

862
01:20:48,288 --> 01:20:52,156
...but I detect a certain...
uncertainty here.

863
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:55,397
There are tests we can do
to determine whether or not this--

864
01:20:55,497 --> 01:20:57,497
I don't want tests.

865
01:20:57,501 --> 01:21:00,004
Tests can't guarantee anything.

866
01:21:00,104 --> 01:21:04,184
The baby could start off
normal and then become--

867
01:21:06,379 --> 01:21:08,847
I want an abortion.

868
01:21:10,452 --> 01:21:13,615
I'II do it myself if I have to.

869
01:21:13,724 --> 01:21:19,419
Okay, if you’ll just slip into that,
we'll be on our way in no time.

870
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:45,722
Oh-- No. No.

871
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:51,331
Wait. Seth, no.

872
01:22:16,942 --> 01:22:20,070
Why did you want to kill Brundle?

873
01:22:20,181 --> 01:22:25,118
The baby... might be
all that's left of the real me.

874
01:22:27,825 --> 01:22:29,825
Please don't kill me.

875
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:34,732
I can't have it.
I'm afraid.

876
01:22:34,834 --> 01:22:38,770
Please. Have the baby.

877
01:22:38,872 --> 01:22:42,831
I can't. I can't.

878
01:22:42,945 --> 01:22:46,381
Too bad.

879
01:22:51,323 --> 01:22:53,621
Too bad.

880
01:25:14,417 --> 01:25:16,942
Jesus.

881
01:25:19,057 --> 01:25:21,548
Ah.

882
01:25:21,661 --> 01:25:24,289
Let me go. Let me go.

883
01:26:24,847 --> 01:26:26,847
No.. Don't..

884
01:26:26,915 --> 01:26:30,874
Don't, please.
Please.

885
01:26:52,818 --> 01:26:56,151
Help me.
Help me to be human.

886
01:26:57,324 --> 01:26:59,324
How?

887
01:27:01,296 --> 01:27:04,265
Oh.

888
01:27:06,937 --> 01:27:08,937
Well...

889
01:27:11,677 --> 01:27:13,804
I go there...

890
01:27:13,913 --> 01:27:17,508
...and, uh,
you go there.

891
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:24,785
We... come apart...

892
01:27:24,895 --> 01:27:29,662
...and... then we...
come together there.

893
01:27:31,637 --> 01:27:35,073
You, me... and the baby.

894
01:27:35,175 --> 01:27:37,473
Together.

895
01:27:53,934 --> 01:27:56,402
No.

896
01:27:56,503 --> 01:27:59,495
We’ll be the ultimate family.

897
01:27:59,609 --> 01:28:01,770
A family of three...

898
01:28:01,878 --> 01:28:04,513
...joined together in one body.

899
01:28:05,350 --> 01:28:08,012
More human than I am alone.

900
01:28:08,119 --> 01:28:08,921
Oh, no.
No. No, no.

901
01:28:09,021 --> 01:28:12,354
Oh, no.
No. No, no.

902
01:28:22,539 --> 01:28:26,236
No. No. No. No.

903
01:28:32,486 --> 01:28:35,580
Oh, please.
Oh, God, please.

904
01:28:35,690 --> 01:28:37,783
Oh. Oh.

905
01:28:39,696 --> 01:28:43,996
Oh. No. Oh. Oh.

906
01:28:44,102 --> 01:28:47,265
God.. No.. No..

907
01:28:47,373 --> 01:28:49,373
Oh, God..

908
01:28:49,376 --> 01:28:52,607
Please, don't.
No, don't.

909
01:28:52,714 --> 01:28:55,148
No.. No..

910
01:29:05,632 --> 01:29:07,632
No.

911
01:29:16,547 --> 01:29:20,381
Please.
Let me out. Oh, God.

912
01:32:27,072 --> 01:32:30,701
No. No, I can't.

913
01:32:30,810 --> 01:32:34,302
No.. I can't. No.

914
01:32:37,652 --> 01:32:39,984
No. God.
