1
00:01:04,157 --> 00:01:08,236
Senator Samuel Foley died a minute ago
here at St Vincent's.

2
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,361
At the bedside was political sidekick
Senator Joseph Paine.

3
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,869
Senator Joseph Paine speaking. I want
the Governor's residence, Jackson City.

4
00:01:17,045 --> 00:01:19,251
Hello?

5
00:01:19,422 --> 00:01:22,589
Oh, Joe! Oh no!

6
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,219
It couldn't have happened at a worse
time. Tell Jim Taylor I'm coming home.

7
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:29,962
- Yes, Joe. Right away.
- What is it?

8
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:35,764
Sam Foley's dead. Of all times...
Foley had to go and die on us.

9
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:39,140
- Who are you calling this late?
- Taylor, my dear.

10
00:01:39,317 --> 00:01:42,401
- What's up?
- Sam Foley died tonight.

11
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,279
That's too bad.
Don't get excited. Is Paine coming?

12
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,364
Yes, Jim. Yes, Jim. Yes, Jim.

13
00:01:51,537 --> 00:01:54,372
He'd drop dead
if you ever said no to him.

14
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,036
This is no time for jokes.
I've got to appoint a new senator.

15
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:02,379
The Governor will see all committees.

16
00:02:02,548 --> 00:02:05,668
Tell the governor
I won't wait any longer.

17
00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:08,334
I guess Taylor's telling him what to do.

18
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:12,593
Tell them to wait.
I'll see them immediately.

19
00:02:12,768 --> 00:02:18,307
I've got to see those citizens. They
want a say in who goes to the Senate.

20
00:02:18,482 --> 00:02:22,859
- Ten to one they've got a man.
- Relax, Happy. Stop having kittens.

21
00:02:23,028 --> 00:02:27,939
Tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine they have
one more minute to make up their minds.

22
00:02:28,116 --> 00:02:31,366
- You go and tell Jim Taylor.
- I will tell him.

23
00:02:31,536 --> 00:02:34,786
It's high time
I told Jim Taylor a thing or two.

24
00:02:34,956 --> 00:02:40,544
If you and Joe'll gab on about this
appointment, I'll see the committees.

25
00:02:40,713 --> 00:02:45,006
- See them when we're finished.
- Yes, Jim. But hurry, will you?

26
00:02:45,175 --> 00:02:47,084
We'll hurry.

27
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:51,680
That's telling him, old boy.

28
00:02:52,724 --> 00:02:56,224
With this Willet Creek dam coming up. -

29
00:02:56,395 --> 00:03:01,768
- The man who goes to the Senate can't
ask any questions or talk out of tone.

30
00:03:01,941 --> 00:03:06,022
- We have to be absolutely sure of him.
- I say Horace Miller.

31
00:03:06,196 --> 00:03:08,603
He'll take orders all right.

32
00:03:08,782 --> 00:03:11,653
Suppose we don't
go through with this dam?

33
00:03:11,827 --> 00:03:16,453
Postpone it until next session
of Congress. Or drop it all together.

34
00:03:16,623 --> 00:03:21,617
That would be a crime, Joe...
After all the work we put in on it.

35
00:03:21,795 --> 00:03:25,958
Burying it in this deficiency bill
as nice as you please. -

36
00:03:26,132 --> 00:03:31,091
- Having it approved. It's rolling
along... like taking candy from a baby.

37
00:03:31,263 --> 00:03:34,598
Is it worth the risk of a scandal?

38
00:03:34,768 --> 00:03:40,472
What's the matter with you?
I wouldn't take the slightest risk -

39
00:03:40,648 --> 00:03:45,393
- Now you've made such a great
reputation for yourself in the Senate.

40
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:49,734
Look at the campaign I've started
for you in all of my papers

41
00:03:50,742 --> 00:03:55,782
- It's a little obscure, isn't it?
- I don't know... Maybe.

42
00:03:56,872 --> 00:04:01,166
But after all, you're the logical man
from the West for the national ticket.

43
00:04:01,335 --> 00:04:04,252
At the convention anything can happen.

44
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:09,961
If what you say about the future is
possible, why not drop this dam?

45
00:04:10,135 --> 00:04:15,640
We can't do it. We've been quietly
buying up all the land around it.

46
00:04:15,808 --> 00:04:18,844
Holding it in dummy names.

47
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,768
If we drop it now,
it'll bring about an investigation.

48
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:28,148
It will show that we were going to sell
it to the state under phoney names.

49
00:04:28,321 --> 00:04:33,990
The smartest thing for us to do is
to push it through the way it's going.

50
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:38,109
All right. Appoint Miller
if you are sure he will take orders.

51
00:04:38,288 --> 00:04:41,538
Don't worry. He'll take orders.
Come on.

52
00:04:43,461 --> 00:04:46,996
- Just one more minute.
- Happy, we've got your man.

53
00:04:47,173 --> 00:04:49,213
- Horace Miller.
- Horace Miller?!

54
00:04:49,384 --> 00:04:52,918
A born stooge!
Horace'll perform like a trained seal.

55
00:04:53,096 --> 00:04:56,547
- What did I tell you, Joe?
- But if I throw a party man like...

56
00:04:56,724 --> 00:05:00,426
For reasons I can't go into now,
it has to be Horace Miller.

57
00:05:00,603 --> 00:05:03,639
I've given you the man,
make out your ticket.

58
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:08,393
But I have to see those angry
committees first! Work for harmony!

59
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:13,813
Considering the candidates who answer to
the high qualifications of senators. -

60
00:05:13,992 --> 00:05:16,743
One name shone out like a beacon.

61
00:05:16,911 --> 00:05:20,695
- The honourable Horace Miller.
- No!

62
00:05:20,873 --> 00:05:24,076
- He's Taylor's stooge!
- The veterans'll have no part of him!

63
00:05:24,252 --> 00:05:27,288
The New Citizens Committee
won't stand for him!

64
00:05:27,463 --> 00:05:31,627
So... they named their own candidate.
Who?

65
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:34,470
- You won't like him.
- Who?

66
00:05:34,637 --> 00:05:38,007
- Henry Hill.
- That crackpot, that longhead!

67
00:05:38,183 --> 00:05:41,717
- You should have killed that so fast.
- I couldn't. Those men...

68
00:05:41,894 --> 00:05:44,516
Never mind. Forget it.

69
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,978
That bunch is out for blood...

70
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:51,562
I said: Forget about them.
Horace Miller goes to the Senate.

71
00:05:51,738 --> 00:05:55,106
- I won't send Horace Miller.
- Oh, you won't?

72
00:05:55,282 --> 00:05:57,489
No, I won't.

73
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,790
I won't let you stand there callously
and wreck my political future.

74
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:05,123
Your political future?
I gave it to you as a present.

75
00:06:05,293 --> 00:06:08,046
I can grab it back so fast
it'll make your head swim.

76
00:06:08,214 --> 00:06:12,875
You've got a nerve worrying about
your future when we're in this spot.

77
00:06:13,051 --> 00:06:15,210
The man is Miller.

78
00:06:17,515 --> 00:06:19,423
Hello, Dad.

79
00:06:21,977 --> 00:06:24,433
Is it getting you down?

80
00:06:24,605 --> 00:06:27,641
- Is what getting me down?
- You're in a pickle, Pop.

81
00:06:27,816 --> 00:06:32,811
- Looks like Henry Hill or else...
- No, it's Horace Miller or else!

82
00:06:32,989 --> 00:06:37,615
I wouldn't appoint an old twerp
like Miller. Taylor or no Taylor.

83
00:06:37,785 --> 00:06:42,078
- What's Taylor got to do with this?
- He's still running the show, ain't he?

84
00:06:42,247 --> 00:06:45,996
I won't have this conversation
carried on by the children.

85
00:06:46,168 --> 00:06:48,161
Won't you listen to them for a change?

86
00:06:48,337 --> 00:06:51,290
No doubt my children
could make this appointment.

87
00:06:51,464 --> 00:06:56,921
- That's easy, Dad. Jefferson Smith!
- He's the only senator to have.

88
00:06:57,095 --> 00:07:00,428
- He ought to be president.
- I like Jeff Smith.

89
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:03,885
- Me too.
- Now everybody's been heard from.

90
00:07:04,061 --> 00:07:08,105
Forgive my ignorance, but I don't
know him from a hole in the ground.

91
00:07:08,274 --> 00:07:11,275
- Head of the Boy Rangers.
- A boy?

92
00:07:11,443 --> 00:07:17,779
No, Jeff's a man. Biggest expert we got
on wild game, animals and rocks.

93
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:22,197
Right now he's the greatest hero.
It's all over the headlines.

94
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:26,950
Didn't you see about the forest fire
all around Sweetwater?

95
00:07:27,127 --> 00:07:29,795
Jeff put that out. Himself.

96
00:07:29,962 --> 00:07:33,166
- If you really want a senator...
- I do not want a senator.

97
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:36,958
- No more of this nonsense!
- He's the greatest American we got.

98
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:41,882
He knows what George Washington said
by heart and Boy Stuff is swell.

99
00:07:42,058 --> 00:07:46,554
- What stuff?
- That's the name of Jeff's paper.

100
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:51,437
Look, here's one. It's great!
Everybody reads it. A million kids.

101
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:56,070
- Let me read you...
- I'm in no mood for childish prattle.

102
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:59,939
- Prattle! You're all wet.
- You couldn't do better.

103
00:08:00,117 --> 00:08:03,285
- Better than what?
- Jeff for senator!

104
00:08:03,454 --> 00:08:05,780
You want to get out of your pickle.

105
00:08:05,957 --> 00:08:08,992
50,000 kids with two folks a piece!
And they vote!

106
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:13,166
- You want to do some good.
- If you'll ever stand up like a man...

107
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:17,289
That settles it. I will not
be belittled by my own children.

108
00:08:17,468 --> 00:08:21,169
All my nerves are strained
to the breaking point.

109
00:08:21,347 --> 00:08:27,183
Henry Hill, Horace Miller...
Miller, Hill... Hill, Miller.

110
00:08:29,896 --> 00:08:33,148
Heads Hill, tails Miller.

111
00:08:54,464 --> 00:08:56,956
That's good enough for me.

112
00:09:19,281 --> 00:09:22,484
- Good evening.
- Is Jefferson Smith at home?

113
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:25,493
Yes. Won't you step in?

114
00:09:40,843 --> 00:09:43,845
A boy ranger to the Senate?

115
00:09:44,014 --> 00:09:48,591
A simpleton. A big-eyed patriot.
Knows Lincoln and Washington by heart.

116
00:09:48,767 --> 00:09:51,177
Stands at attention
in the Governor's presence.

117
00:09:51,355 --> 00:09:54,107
Even collects stray boys and cats.

118
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:58,225
You know what I mean. A perfect man.
Never in politics in his life.

119
00:09:58,404 --> 00:10:02,616
Wouldn't know what it was all about
in two years, let alone two months.

120
00:10:02,783 --> 00:10:06,449
This was the genius of the stroke:
It means votes.

121
00:10:06,621 --> 00:10:10,155
The hero of 50,000 boys
and 100,000 parents.

122
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:14,793
Just look over those congratulations.
I tell you, gentlemen...

123
00:10:14,962 --> 00:10:18,911
- You made the appointment without me.
- When the lightning struck...

124
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,796
You didn't ask me!

125
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,518
Wait a minute, Jim. Happy may have
hit on something tremendous here.

126
00:10:31,979 --> 00:10:37,186
Do you really think you can handle him
in Washington? That it's all right?

127
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:42,186
I think it's all right. A young patriot.
Recites Lincoln and Jefferson.

128
00:10:42,363 --> 00:10:48,319
Turned loose in our nation's capital.
Yes... I think it's all right.

129
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:57,037
Turn the ballyhoo boys loose.
It's the greatest appointment ever made.

130
00:10:57,212 --> 00:11:00,996
- Give a banquet and declare a holiday.
- A star-spangled banquet!

131
00:11:09,017 --> 00:11:11,425
Who did your governor grant that honour?

132
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:15,351
Some wealthy, influential citizen
merely to curry favour?

133
00:11:15,523 --> 00:11:17,350
No!!

134
00:11:17,525 --> 00:11:21,819
Did he give it
to some unworthy political hireling?

135
00:11:21,988 --> 00:11:26,983
No! What did he do?
He went down among the people.

136
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:32,285
And there he found...
a nugget.

137
00:11:37,378 --> 00:11:40,166
We are gathered here tonight -

138
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:45,963
- To acclaim and wish God's speed
to Senator Jefferson Smith.

139
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,100
Thank you, I...

140
00:12:02,987 --> 00:12:08,657
I can't help feeling
there's been a big mistake somehow.

141
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:16,995
Of course I never could see why we
needed two senators from this state -

142
00:12:17,168 --> 00:12:22,127
- When we have a man like Joseph Paine
representing us already.

143
00:12:24,885 --> 00:12:30,389
He probably doesn't remember me.
He knew my father well. Clayton Smith.

144
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:36,344
They went to school together
and were very good friends.

145
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:44,108
Just to sit here with him
is a very great honour for me.

146
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:50,863
Because Dad used to tell me Joe Paine
was the finest man he ever knew.

147
00:12:55,874 --> 00:12:58,626
Get up, Joe. Take a bow.

148
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:08,637
I don't think I'll be much help to you
down in Washington, Senator.

149
00:13:08,805 --> 00:13:11,211
I'll do my best.

150
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:16,515
Although, with all my might...
I can promise you one thing:

151
00:13:16,686 --> 00:13:22,939
I'll do nothing to disgrace the office
of United States Senator.

152
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,221
Senator Jefferson Smith.

153
00:13:54,393 --> 00:14:00,097
The boy rangers are very proud
to take this oppor... occasion...

154
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:04,317
We are happy
to take this opportunity...

155
00:14:04,485 --> 00:14:06,359
To present.

156
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:12,365
...to resent this... small token
of our affection and esteem.

157
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:15,489
- To the best...
...friend, friend!

158
00:14:15,663 --> 00:14:18,783
Oh, heck. It's a briefcase, Jeff.

159
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:23,916
To carry your laws
when you get to Washington.

160
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:03,286
It isn't much, but if you insist.
Here's this week's.

161
00:15:03,462 --> 00:15:07,459
Boy Stuff.
Printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff.

162
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:11,960
You're just like your father.
Even to the hat.

163
00:15:12,138 --> 00:15:16,134
Same old dreamer too.
One look at you and I can see him.

164
00:15:16,307 --> 00:15:19,808
Back at his old desk, hat and all,
getting out his paper.

165
00:15:19,979 --> 00:15:23,560
Always kept his hat on,
so he was ready to do battle.

166
00:15:23,731 --> 00:15:28,229
Clayton Smith, editor and publisher.
Champion of lost causes.

167
00:15:28,403 --> 00:15:32,400
Dad always said
those were the only worthy causes.

168
00:15:32,574 --> 00:15:35,659
You don't have to tell me.
We were a team.

169
00:15:35,828 --> 00:15:38,911
The struggling editor
and the struggling lawyer.

170
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,956
- The twin champions of lost causes.
- Ma has told me a thousand times.

171
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,796
His last fight was his best.

172
00:15:46,963 --> 00:15:51,874
He and his little four page paper
against that mining syndicate.

173
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:56,631
And all to defend the right of
one small miner who stuck to his claim.

174
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:03,435
They tried everything.
Bribery, intimidation...

175
00:16:04,982 --> 00:16:07,187
And then...

176
00:16:09,694 --> 00:16:13,314
Yes, Ma found him
slumped over his desk that morning...

177
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:19,530
Shot in the back.
I was there... I can see him.

178
00:16:19,706 --> 00:16:25,708
At that old roll-top desk,
still with his hat on.

179
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:31,920
Still with his hat on.

180
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:35,845
I know...

181
00:16:36,014 --> 00:16:41,351
I suppose when a fellow bucks up
against a big organisation like that. -

182
00:16:41,518 --> 00:16:44,935
One man by himself can't get very far.

183
00:16:45,106 --> 00:16:46,932
No.

184
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:52,726
- Washington, huh?
- Yes, Senator, for the fifth time.

185
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:57,484
- I'd better see about my pigeons.
- They're coming along.

186
00:16:58,703 --> 00:17:00,742
My head is like a balloon.

187
00:17:00,913 --> 00:17:04,958
Two whole days! I never knew
there was so much American history.

188
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:10,250
- I got them. They're all right.
- That ends that crisis. Come along.

189
00:17:10,422 --> 00:17:12,665
Hello, father.

190
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,297
Let me get to him.

191
00:17:18,096 --> 00:17:22,261
- Susan, this is Jefferson...
- I don't care, I want my money now.

192
00:17:22,435 --> 00:17:24,889
One dollar each for the milk fund.

193
00:17:25,061 --> 00:17:27,599
- That's five dollars.
- Yes.

194
00:17:31,486 --> 00:17:35,234
- You've got five dollars?
- Can't seem to find anything but keys.

195
00:17:35,406 --> 00:17:39,868
- Jeff, this is my daughter Susan.
- Not the new senator?

196
00:17:40,037 --> 00:17:42,028
He's marvellous.

197
00:17:42,204 --> 00:17:44,494
What have you got there, Senator?

198
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:47,371
They're pigeons
to carry messages back to Ma.

199
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:51,921
The one that makes it home in the best
time I'll enter in the naionals.

200
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:56,798
- Hello, Joe!
- I'm glad to see you.

201
00:17:58,597 --> 00:18:03,093
Meet Mr Cook and Mr Griffith,
members of our state headquarters here.

202
00:18:03,268 --> 00:18:06,185
A pleasure. You'll do the state proud.

203
00:18:06,354 --> 00:18:10,399
Welcome. The wildlife here
is not like you're used to.

204
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:12,689
They wear high heels.

205
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,775
We must see a lot of you
and your little feathered friends.

206
00:18:16,948 --> 00:18:19,319
Thank you very much.

207
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:23,744
- Come on, father.
- Chick.

208
00:18:23,914 --> 00:18:27,780
- I've got him. We'll be along.
- Good luck, Senator.

209
00:18:29,377 --> 00:18:34,797
- Things sure happen fast around here.
- You must get yourself out of low gear.

210
00:18:34,965 --> 00:18:38,631
Let's get these bags
and livestock together.

211
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:43,345
- Look! There it is!
- Who? What?

212
00:18:43,515 --> 00:18:48,310
- The capitol dome.
- It's been there a long time, sir.

213
00:18:48,481 --> 00:18:51,683
Yes, sir. This way, Senator.

214
00:19:01,452 --> 00:19:06,113
Maybe we ought to meet him
in short pants with hatchets.

215
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:09,326
What did he bring his pigeons for?

216
00:19:09,502 --> 00:19:14,495
Suppose there's a storm, all the lines
are down, how will you reach Ma?

217
00:19:14,672 --> 00:19:20,297
This way, Senator. Where is he?
I told that cookie to...

218
00:19:20,471 --> 00:19:23,258
Come along. Let's find him.

219
00:19:25,976 --> 00:19:29,510
- Positively not in the station.
- What happened to him?

220
00:19:29,687 --> 00:19:31,764
Did you look in the inn?

221
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,689
I'll brain that guy.
Call Paine, call Saunders.

222
00:19:35,861 --> 00:19:38,069
Call the marines, call somebody.

223
00:19:38,238 --> 00:19:43,196
Saunders, it's McGann.
Has Smith shown up at his office yet?

224
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:48,659
- What do you mean? What's so funny?
- Nothing. Try a butterfly net.

225
00:19:48,832 --> 00:19:52,663
If he does show up,
Paine's waiting with the newspaper men.

226
00:19:52,835 --> 00:19:54,995
Let him know right away.

227
00:19:55,172 --> 00:19:59,797
Sure, I'll hang a light in the belfry.
One, if by land. Two, if by sea.

228
00:20:11,814 --> 00:20:16,441
Diz, what do you think?
Daniel Boone's lost.

229
00:20:16,611 --> 00:20:19,565
Lost in the wilds of Washington.

230
00:20:19,739 --> 00:20:22,775
If your boyfriend'll blaze trails,
I'll go to the press club.

231
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,612
Stick around. He might want to go
hiking. Don't miss out on the exercise.

232
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:32,166
Every time I think of exercise, I have
to lie down until the feeling leaves me.

233
00:20:32,335 --> 00:20:36,415
- Wouldn't it be fun if he was lost?
- The boy ranger? He'll show up.

234
00:20:36,589 --> 00:20:38,664
He must have a compass with him.

235
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,297
Where would I go if I was a boy ranger?

236
00:20:41,469 --> 00:20:45,419
- Boy, am I tired!
- Call all the hospitals. Hurry up.

237
00:20:45,598 --> 00:20:50,260
- Get me a bed while you're at it.
- Will you hold this a minute, please?

238
00:20:53,064 --> 00:20:55,103
Come back, here!

239
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:46,393
"...that from these honoured dead
we take increased devotion -

240
00:23:46,572 --> 00:23:52,492
- To that cause for which they gave
the last full measure of devotion -

241
00:23:52,662 --> 00:23:59,496
- That we here highly... resolve that
these dead shall not have died in vain.

242
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:04,912
That this nation, under God,
shall have a new birth of -

243
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,792
Freedom -

244
00:24:07,969 --> 00:24:12,512
- And that government of the people,
by the people, for the people -

245
00:24:12,682 --> 00:24:15,599
Shall not perish from the earth."

246
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:27,529
Why don't they try the police, call out
some bloodhounds or Indian guides?

247
00:24:27,697 --> 00:24:30,864
The one place he knows is the office.
You stay there and wait.

248
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:34,734
All right, Senator.
Just one half hour more.

249
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:40,953
- Why don't I quit?
- Eight to five he's plastered.

250
00:24:41,127 --> 00:24:45,873
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out?
I'm fed up with politics -

251
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:50,046
- And now I've let them
talk me into staying.

252
00:24:50,219 --> 00:24:53,304
Secretary to a leader of squirts.

253
00:24:53,473 --> 00:24:57,517
Because I need the job
and a new suit of clothes.

254
00:24:57,685 --> 00:25:01,518
- Would you settle for a husband?
- I sure would.

255
00:25:03,941 --> 00:25:09,400
You know my standing offer. Diz Moore,
poet of Washington correspondents.

256
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:14,069
- That again.
- I'd cherish you and I'd stay sober.

257
00:25:14,244 --> 00:25:21,410
Diz, you're a wonderful egg. Maybe if
I saw you once with your hair combed.

258
00:25:23,004 --> 00:25:27,712
- I don't think even that would do it.
- No point in combing my hair then.

259
00:25:29,092 --> 00:25:34,965
Honorary appointment. They just need
a dope here for a couple of months.

260
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,179
Yes?

261
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,474
Yes!

262
00:25:39,645 --> 00:25:42,930
- What do you want?
- Office of Jefferson Smith?

263
00:25:43,106 --> 00:25:45,147
No.

264
00:25:46,361 --> 00:25:49,230
- The man downstairs...
- No!

265
00:25:57,037 --> 00:26:01,581
They must have picked the prize dummy.
Say, wait a minute.

266
00:26:01,751 --> 00:26:04,288
That wouldn't be Daniel Boone?

267
00:26:05,295 --> 00:26:08,996
- Say, mister. What's your name?
- Jefferson Smith.

268
00:26:10,217 --> 00:26:13,170
Come right in, Mr Smith.
Right this way.

269
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:17,129
Hold everything. Stay there.
Now don't move!

270
00:26:17,308 --> 00:26:20,972
Helen, get me the Madison.
Senator Paine. Hurry up.

271
00:26:22,103 --> 00:26:24,597
- Is anything the matter?
- Oh, no. No!

272
00:26:24,774 --> 00:26:31,109
Dear Senator, it may be customary on the
prairie to not show up for five hours.

273
00:26:31,281 --> 00:26:35,858
I'm very sorry about that, Miss...
You are Miss Saunders, aren't you?

274
00:26:36,035 --> 00:26:39,321
Yes, I'm Saunders.
This is Mr Moore, member of the press.

275
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:42,582
- Meet the senator.
- I'm very happy to know you, sir.

276
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,537
You cut your way through that forest.

277
00:26:48,465 --> 00:26:52,508
Senator Paine, we've got him.
He's right here and he's sober.

278
00:26:52,676 --> 00:26:55,347
Yes, I'll have him right over there.

279
00:26:57,098 --> 00:27:01,974
I'm awfully sorry. It wasn't until
I was fairly well along on the bus...

280
00:27:02,145 --> 00:27:06,640
- Did you say bus?
- It was one of those sightseers.

281
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:13,774
I've never been called
absent-minded before.

282
00:27:13,947 --> 00:27:19,702
But there it was all of a sudden.
Staring right at me at the station.

283
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:24,117
- There what was?
- The dome. The capitol dome.

284
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:28,242
Big as life.
Sparkling away under the old sun.

285
00:27:30,881 --> 00:27:35,793
I just started to go towards it,
and there was a bus outside. -

286
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,460
And I just naturally got aboard.

287
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:41,428
Most natural thing in the world.

288
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,556
I don't think I've ever been
so thrilled in my life.

289
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,648
And that Lincoln memorial...

290
00:27:48,817 --> 00:27:50,976
Gee whiz!

291
00:27:51,987 --> 00:27:54,442
Mr Lincoln, there he is.

292
00:27:55,949 --> 00:28:00,326
He's just looking straight at you
as you come up those steps.

293
00:28:00,495 --> 00:28:05,490
Just... sitting there like he was
waiting for somebody to come along.

294
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:09,878
- Well, he's got nothing on me.
- I'm sorry.

295
00:28:10,046 --> 00:28:15,124
If you're ready, we'll go over
to the hotel. Paine's waiting for you.

296
00:28:25,228 --> 00:28:30,389
- Is this my office?
- No, you have a private office.

297
00:28:30,567 --> 00:28:32,725
A private office, huh?

298
00:28:33,862 --> 00:28:35,938
In there?

299
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,357
Right in this door?

300
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:50,287
All right, Senator. Where is he?
Has he gone out again?

301
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:55,372
He's in there. See you later.
I'll go out and drink this over.

302
00:28:59,389 --> 00:29:03,681
- Whose statue is that?
- I wouldn't know in the daytime.

303
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:07,137
Look, the capitol dome!
It's all lighted up!

304
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:11,892
You better relax, Senator.
You'll get yourself plumb wore out.

305
00:29:12,068 --> 00:29:15,768
Gee whiz,
so many things happening all at once.

306
00:29:16,572 --> 00:29:21,199
- What time does the Senate...
...convene.

307
00:29:21,369 --> 00:29:23,907
Twelve noon.

308
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,617
Boy, that'll be something.

309
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:30,242
- You know what I'll do in the morning?
- What will you do?

310
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:34,797
I'll go out to Mount Vernon.
It will be a fine thing to do.

311
00:29:34,966 --> 00:29:39,793
Visit Washington's home before walking
into the Senate for the first time.

312
00:29:39,971 --> 00:29:43,671
Wonderful.
It'll put you right in the mood.

313
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:45,676
What's that?!

314
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:48,473
Oh, movie houses...

315
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:58,485
I'm still asking myself? What is he:
Animal, vegetable or mineral?

316
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:03,448
Me sitting around playing straight
for that phoney patriotic chatter.

317
00:30:03,619 --> 00:30:07,035
Carrying bibs for an infant
with little flags in his fist.

318
00:30:07,206 --> 00:30:12,081
- I can't take it. I quit.
- Take it easy, simmer down.

319
00:30:12,252 --> 00:30:14,709
Here. Take this.

320
00:30:14,881 --> 00:30:18,582
You know what he'll do tomorrow
before taking that Senate seat?

321
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,674
Go to Mount Vernon to get in the mood.
A warm-up.

322
00:30:22,847 --> 00:30:26,596
Your boss? A nut?
I knew there was a story in that guy.

323
00:30:26,768 --> 00:30:28,974
Go chase an ambulance.

324
00:30:29,145 --> 00:30:33,273
Let me at him, five minutes.
I'll make it right with you.

325
00:30:33,441 --> 00:30:35,433
Here's what I'll do.

326
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:39,822
A World Series pass. In a month
it'll be worth 15 bucks.

327
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:42,278
- Well...
- You're not talking to this guy.

328
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,194
What do you say?

329
00:30:44,369 --> 00:30:47,738
- Your pals want to get in on this?
- I want a scoop.

330
00:30:47,914 --> 00:30:51,663
Either it's lots of reporters
and lots of tickets or...

331
00:30:51,835 --> 00:30:57,077
- Call them before I change my mind.
- Okay. I'll see you right here.

332
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:03,130
- What are you gonna do?
- Get my fall outfit and quit in style.

333
00:31:03,304 --> 00:31:06,590
You've got more sense
than to put Nosey on to that guy.

334
00:31:06,766 --> 00:31:09,466
That's it! Open your eyes!

335
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:15,056
- Tell us about yourself.
- I hear you've got a boys club.

336
00:31:15,233 --> 00:31:17,640
Have you got any special axe to grind?

337
00:31:17,819 --> 00:31:20,855
Pet idea...
Save the buffalo, pension bill?

338
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:24,150
You must have one idea
for the good of the country.

339
00:31:24,325 --> 00:31:26,947
Well, I have got one idea...

340
00:31:27,829 --> 00:31:30,784
I think it would be a wonderful idea -

341
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:34,825
- To have a national boys camp
out in our state.

342
00:31:35,004 --> 00:31:40,128
If we could get the poor kids off the
streets for a few months every summer -

343
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:45,508
- And let them learn something
about nature and American ideals.

344
00:31:45,681 --> 00:31:48,172
What would this set the government back?

345
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:53,807
Nothing at all. My idea is
that the government lends us the money -

346
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:59,604
- And then the boys pay it back
by sending pennies and nickels.

347
00:32:01,363 --> 00:32:05,064
The government's got enough
on its hands already without...

348
00:32:05,242 --> 00:32:09,156
That's great. The government's
putting dough in too many places.

349
00:32:09,329 --> 00:32:13,327
Senator, what do you think of
the girls in this town?

350
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:18,127
Four of them came up and kissed me
when I got off the train.

351
00:32:19,214 --> 00:32:21,041
Were they pretty?

352
00:32:21,216 --> 00:32:25,593
That Miss Susan Paine is about
the prettiest girl I ever did see.

353
00:32:27,389 --> 00:32:29,678
How about some more pictures?

354
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:33,550
You're a nature lover.
Can you handle some sign language?

355
00:32:33,729 --> 00:32:36,136
Do you know any bird calls?

356
00:32:36,314 --> 00:32:40,395
- Can you make a sound like an eagle?
- Well, here's one...

357
00:32:40,569 --> 00:32:44,187
I'm the only one in the state
who knows this one.

358
00:33:07,346 --> 00:33:10,300
His first whiff of Washington?

359
00:33:12,101 --> 00:33:15,221
- Do I actually see this?
- What is it?

360
00:33:17,024 --> 00:33:20,438
- Did you want to see me?
- What's this about you quitting?

361
00:33:20,609 --> 00:33:24,359
- I'm not a registered nurse.
- How did this happen?

362
00:33:24,531 --> 00:33:28,231
The ranger's notices.
I haven't the slightest idea.

363
00:33:28,409 --> 00:33:32,906
I merely took him home.
It's not my job to tuck him in.

364
00:33:33,081 --> 00:33:36,247
McGann's out of his mind.
Smith's gone again.

365
00:33:36,417 --> 00:33:40,166
He went to Mount Vernon
to give himself a patriotic address.

366
00:33:40,338 --> 00:33:43,255
Stop this nonsense.
Go back to Smith's office -

367
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,666
And get him to the Senate by twelve.

368
00:33:45,843 --> 00:33:50,137
I wasn't given a brain
to tell a boy ranger what time it is.

369
00:33:50,306 --> 00:33:55,549
If certain things happen, you'll get
one of the biggestjobs in Washington.

370
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:59,595
When I came here,
my eyes were big blue question marks.

371
00:33:59,773 --> 00:34:02,894
- Now they're big green dollar marks.
- Smart girl.

372
00:34:03,069 --> 00:34:06,901
Finish this job properly
and you'll get a handsome bonus.

373
00:34:07,073 --> 00:34:10,942
Keep Smith away from anything
that smacks of politics.

374
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,740
Including Willet Creek dam?

375
00:34:15,373 --> 00:34:19,158
Including Willet Creek dam.
Go back to your work.

376
00:34:24,883 --> 00:34:28,334
- This is it, Senator.
- The United States Senate.

377
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:36,466
- Mr Carson, this is Senator Smith.
- How do you do, Senator?

378
00:34:36,644 --> 00:34:40,512
Glad to see you.
Show Senator Smith to his seat.

379
00:34:40,691 --> 00:34:42,731
Yes, sir. Right this way, sir.

380
00:34:42,902 --> 00:34:46,435
- Well, goodbye.
- Wish me luck.

381
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,508
- That's the boy wonder?
- What is the Senate coming to?

382
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:28,276
- You got Daniel Boone in all right.
- Daniel in the lion's den.

383
00:35:28,448 --> 00:35:33,073
Nice job you and the ambulance chasers
did in the papers this morning.

384
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:41,287
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk.
Daniel Webster used to use it.

385
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,868
Daniel Webster sat here?

386
00:35:44,047 --> 00:35:47,711
Give you something to shoot at.
If you'll do any talking.

387
00:35:47,883 --> 00:35:51,383
- I'll just sit around and listen.
- That's the way to get re-elected.

388
00:35:51,554 --> 00:35:55,966
This is the calendar for the day.
You'll find the Senate manual in here.

389
00:35:56,141 --> 00:35:58,977
Anything else you want,
just snap for a page.

390
00:35:59,145 --> 00:36:04,269
- Where's the majority leader?
- Right over there. Senator Agnew.

391
00:36:04,441 --> 00:36:07,359
Next to Senator Barnes,
the minority leader.

392
00:36:07,528 --> 00:36:11,821
- Where's the press gallery?
- Above the Vice- President's chair.

393
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:16,036
- Front row is the big news services.
- What's that up there?

394
00:36:16,204 --> 00:36:21,542
That corner is for guides and sightseers
who come in to rest their feet.

395
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:24,282
Over there the Senators' friends sit.

396
00:36:24,461 --> 00:36:28,958
Front row, the empty one, is for
the president and White House guests.

397
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:32,335
Back there is the diplomatic section.

398
00:36:34,554 --> 00:36:38,684
They and the page boys
are the only real class in the place.

399
00:36:38,852 --> 00:36:42,434
- I'll take your hat to the cloak room.
- I'll give you a boy ranger button.

400
00:36:42,605 --> 00:36:44,563
- Swell!
- What's your name?

401
00:36:44,733 --> 00:36:47,519
- Richard Jones.
- Dick, thanks ever so much.

402
00:36:47,693 --> 00:36:49,650
Good luck, Senator.

403
00:36:50,906 --> 00:36:54,275
- See you in the White House, Joe.
- No kidding.

404
00:36:54,451 --> 00:36:56,573
Sorry, I was in committee.

405
00:36:57,787 --> 00:37:02,782
I see you had a little publicity...
Have you got your credentials?

406
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:10,415
- Saunders gave them to me.
- That's... that's fine.

407
00:37:11,258 --> 00:37:16,550
When the Vice-president calls you,
I'll meet you in the centre aisle.

408
00:37:16,723 --> 00:37:19,640
This is Daniel Webster's desk.
Did you know that?

409
00:37:19,809 --> 00:37:21,802
He won't mind.

410
00:37:38,578 --> 00:37:40,286
Well...

411
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:55,590
The Senate will come to order.
The chaplain will pray.

412
00:37:57,014 --> 00:37:59,255
Oh, God, our heavenly Father.

413
00:37:59,432 --> 00:38:02,304
In these critical days,
when our beloved country labours with -

414
00:38:02,478 --> 00:38:06,178
- Such grave and disturbing problems,
look upon us, we beseech Thee. -

415
00:38:06,356 --> 00:38:09,940
- And give us the light and strength
to be just and merciful.

416
00:38:10,111 --> 00:38:15,485
So that we may best serve our people
and our fellow men everywhere. Amen.

417
00:38:25,251 --> 00:38:29,710
I ask that the reading of the journal
be dispensed with and stand approved.

418
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:33,296
Is there objection?
The journal stands approved.

419
00:38:33,467 --> 00:38:36,752
Mr President...
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

420
00:38:36,928 --> 00:38:40,677
- The clerk will call the roll.
- Mr Agnew? Mr Albert?...

421
00:38:43,643 --> 00:38:46,598
88 senators answered.
A quorum is present.

422
00:38:48,482 --> 00:38:52,064
I present the credentials of
honourable Jefferson Smith -

423
00:38:52,235 --> 00:38:55,320
- Who has just been appointed senator
by the governor of my state.

424
00:38:55,489 --> 00:38:59,817
The senator is present. I ask that the
oath of office be administered to him.

425
00:38:59,992 --> 00:39:02,994
If the senator designate
presents himself at the desk. -

426
00:39:03,163 --> 00:39:05,785
The oath will be administered.

427
00:39:22,142 --> 00:39:25,345
Mr President,
I rise to a question of order.

428
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,352
I seek to ascertain if the gentleman
about to be sworn in -

429
00:39:29,524 --> 00:39:33,023
- Is fully aware of the responsibilities
of his high office.

430
00:39:33,194 --> 00:39:36,480
I refer to his shameless performance
for the newspapers.

431
00:39:36,656 --> 00:39:40,985
A performance that his party
no doubt will applaud.

432
00:39:43,871 --> 00:39:47,703
But one that brings him down to
the level of a sideshow entertainer -

433
00:39:47,876 --> 00:39:52,787
- And reflects on the sincerity and
sanity of the highest body of lawmakers.

434
00:39:52,964 --> 00:39:57,626
Is this the gentleman's conception of
the nature of his office?

435
00:39:57,802 --> 00:39:59,545
I don't understand...

436
00:39:59,721 --> 00:40:03,765
The designate has no voice until
the oath of office has been administered.

437
00:40:03,933 --> 00:40:08,227
I will answer. My colleague was innocent
in the matter referred to.

438
00:40:08,396 --> 00:40:13,521
He was completely misquoted. I know
Mr Smith and personally vouch for him.

439
00:40:13,693 --> 00:40:17,358
He has the greatest possible respect
for his office.

440
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:19,522
Mr President...

441
00:40:19,699 --> 00:40:23,150
The swearing in of the senator
is the order of business.

442
00:40:23,327 --> 00:40:25,783
The gentleman will raise his right hand.

443
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:29,740
Do you solemnly swear to support and
defend the constitution of the USA -

444
00:40:29,918 --> 00:40:32,919
- Against all enemies,
foreign and domestic. -

445
00:40:33,088 --> 00:40:36,789
- And that you will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same?

446
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:41,593
That you take this obligation freely
without mental reservation -

447
00:40:41,763 --> 00:40:45,713
- And that you will faithfully discharge
the duties of the office -

448
00:40:45,892 --> 00:40:49,724
- Upon which you are about to enter,
so help you God?

449
00:40:49,896 --> 00:40:52,019
I do.

450
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,397
You can talk all you want to now.

451
00:40:57,779 --> 00:41:01,279
Meet the majority leader.
He'll be a good friend.

452
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:04,405
Any friend of Joe's is a friend of mine.

453
00:41:04,578 --> 00:41:08,527
Don't worry about the others,
they're just senators.

454
00:41:09,624 --> 00:41:14,370
The shameless way in which the
deficiency bill has been delayed -

455
00:41:14,546 --> 00:41:16,953
Is nothing short of criminal.

456
00:41:17,132 --> 00:41:20,916
The country agencies
are in desperate need of these funds.

457
00:41:21,094 --> 00:41:24,759
The prime business of this body
is the immediate passage of...

458
00:42:04,973 --> 00:42:08,388
- Who let you in?
- Why aren't you chasing ambulances?

459
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,228
Smith is punching everybody he meets.

460
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:13,471
Oh, Tarzan!

461
00:42:22,489 --> 00:42:24,529
Boys, meet Senator Smith.

462
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:29,992
- You have something on your mind?
- Why don't you tell the truth for once?

463
00:42:30,164 --> 00:42:33,615
- The truth!
- The man wants the truth!

464
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:37,790
"What is the truth?" said jesting pilot
and would not stay for an answer.

465
00:42:37,963 --> 00:42:42,257
- You want it dished out or in a bottle?
- What do people read in the paper?

466
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:46,803
This morning they read
that an incompetent clown had arrived. -

467
00:42:46,972 --> 00:42:49,843
Parading like a member of the Senate.

468
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:55,805
If you thought as much about being
honest as you do about being smart...

469
00:42:55,981 --> 00:42:58,937
We're the only ones
who can afford to be honest.

470
00:42:59,112 --> 00:43:02,277
We don't have to be re-elected.

471
00:43:02,447 --> 00:43:06,113
We tell them when phoneys come
to make their laws.

472
00:43:06,285 --> 00:43:11,112
- You don't get the truth in the Senate.
- What do you know about making laws?

473
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:14,825
- I don't pretend to know.
- Then what are you doing in the Senate?

474
00:43:15,001 --> 00:43:17,457
Honorary appointment!

475
00:43:17,629 --> 00:43:21,841
When the country needs men
who have courage like never before. -

476
00:43:22,009 --> 00:43:25,875
- He's just gonna decorate a chair
and get himself honoured.

477
00:43:26,054 --> 00:43:29,554
He'll vote, sure.
Just like his colleague tells him to.

478
00:43:29,725 --> 00:43:34,552
Yes, sir! Like a Christmas tiger.
He will nod and vote yes.

479
00:43:34,729 --> 00:43:38,513
You're not a senator!
You're an honorary stooge.

480
00:43:38,691 --> 00:43:40,565
You ought to be shown up.

481
00:43:40,735 --> 00:43:45,065
- Have a drink, Senator?
- It will taste better than the truth.

482
00:43:53,457 --> 00:43:57,406
Hey, Senator...
don't let it get you down.

483
00:43:57,585 --> 00:44:00,753
A hundred years from now,
nobody will know the difference.

484
00:44:01,589 --> 00:44:05,337
The point is, they're right.
I'm just decorating a chair.

485
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:10,421
If I'm going to vote,
I ought to study some of the bills.

486
00:44:10,598 --> 00:44:16,223
- The bills?
- Otherwise I'm just a Christmas tiger.

487
00:44:16,397 --> 00:44:20,726
These bills are put together
by legal minds after long study.

488
00:44:20,901 --> 00:44:24,567
I can't understand half of them
and I used to be a lawyer.

489
00:44:24,738 --> 00:44:28,605
Forget it.
I'll advise you how to vote.

490
00:44:28,784 --> 00:44:32,947
I know you will, that's just the point.
There's no reason for me to be here.

491
00:44:33,121 --> 00:44:39,291
Didn't you talk about a boys camp?
You were earnest about that.

492
00:44:39,462 --> 00:44:42,213
- Yes.
- Why don't you do it?

493
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,418
Get a bill started.
Present it to Congress.

494
00:44:45,593 --> 00:44:47,799
It'll be great experience for you.

495
00:44:47,969 --> 00:44:50,591
I've been aching to mention it to you.

496
00:44:50,764 --> 00:44:54,383
If I could just do that one thing...
I'd feel...

497
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,181
What's to stop you? Saunders'll help.

498
00:44:57,354 --> 00:45:01,815
I will do it. I knew that
if anyone could help me, you could.

499
00:45:01,984 --> 00:45:04,770
Thank you again for your time, sir.
Good night.

500
00:45:04,945 --> 00:45:09,157
- Where are you running off to?
- I'm anxious to get back to the office.

501
00:45:12,285 --> 00:45:17,328
- Oh, the man on the front page.
- He just dropped in for a minute.

502
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:20,868
How do you do, Miss Paine?
I'm on my way to the office.

503
00:45:21,044 --> 00:45:24,378
- How are the pigeons?
- They're fine.

504
00:45:24,548 --> 00:45:30,052
I released one this morning.
He flew straight up in the air -

505
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:35,559
- And went around the capitol dome
and then he headed west like a bat...

506
00:45:35,726 --> 00:45:41,848
Just like a rifle shot. By this
time he's probably over Kentucky.

507
00:45:42,025 --> 00:45:46,069
Isn't that wonderful, father?
And was the letter to your girl?

508
00:45:46,238 --> 00:45:50,400
Oh, no...
I don't have a girl.

509
00:45:50,574 --> 00:45:55,700
- I'd better hold this for you.
- No, I'd better go. Good night.

510
00:45:58,791 --> 00:46:01,995
Doggone!...I'm sorry, sir.

511
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:04,661
That's all right.

512
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:16,723
- Gee, I'm sorry. Good night.
- Good night, Jeff.

513
00:46:27,529 --> 00:46:31,477
Oh, father. Oh, dear me.

514
00:46:31,657 --> 00:46:35,193
At the expense of the furniture,
you've made another conquest.

515
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:38,987
- Not old Honest Abe.
- And with Honest Abe's ideals.

516
00:46:39,164 --> 00:46:42,499
A rare man these days, Susan.

517
00:46:44,419 --> 00:46:49,333
We're going right ahead with
my bill for a national boys' camp.

518
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:53,720
- Where's my briefcase?
- You're going to present a bill?

519
00:46:53,888 --> 00:46:57,757
- Yes, Senator Paine and I decided...
- Senator Paine decided this with you?

520
00:46:57,935 --> 00:46:59,725
It was his idea.

521
00:46:59,894 --> 00:47:04,224
Dear Senator, have you got any idea
what it takes to get a bill passed?

522
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,099
- No. You're going to help me.
- If I were triplets I could.

523
00:47:08,277 --> 00:47:12,323
Senator Paine said you'd help me.
Now, what books do we have to have?

524
00:47:12,491 --> 00:47:17,152
May I give you a rough idea of
what you're up against?

525
00:47:19,998 --> 00:47:24,541
A senator has a bill in mind.
Now, what does he do?

526
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:29,172
He has to sit down and write it up.
Why, when, where, how?

527
00:47:29,341 --> 00:47:33,172
- That takes time.
- But this one is so simple.

528
00:47:33,345 --> 00:47:35,421
And with your help...

529
00:47:35,597 --> 00:47:37,590
It's simple and I'm helping. -

530
00:47:37,766 --> 00:47:41,016
- So we knock it off
in three or four days.

531
00:47:41,186 --> 00:47:43,594
- A day.
- A day?!

532
00:47:43,772 --> 00:47:46,558
Just tonight.

533
00:47:46,732 --> 00:47:52,902
I don't want to complain, but there's
an institution called dinner.

534
00:47:53,073 --> 00:47:55,528
I'm sort of hungry myself.

535
00:47:55,700 --> 00:48:00,528
Couldn't we have something brought in
on trays like big executives?

536
00:48:00,706 --> 00:48:07,041
Sure. Dinner comes in on trays.
We're big executives.

537
00:48:07,213 --> 00:48:09,668
We finish the bill before morning.

538
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,708
It's dawn. Your bill is ready.
You introduce it.

539
00:48:13,886 --> 00:48:18,132
You get to your feet in the Senate,
take a long breath and start spouting.

540
00:48:18,306 --> 00:48:22,056
Not too loud, a couple of the Senators
might want to sleep.

541
00:48:22,228 --> 00:48:26,225
Then a pageboy takes it to the desk
where a long-faced clerk reads it. -

542
00:48:26,398 --> 00:48:29,068
Refers it to the right committee.

543
00:48:29,235 --> 00:48:31,311
Why?

544
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:37,739
Committees are small groups of senators
who sift a bill down and report back.

545
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:42,786
You can't take a bill nobody's heard of
and discuss it among 96 men.

546
00:48:42,957 --> 00:48:45,578
- I see that.
- Good.

547
00:48:45,751 --> 00:48:48,668
- Where are we?
- Some committee's got it.

548
00:48:48,837 --> 00:48:52,752
Days are going by, Senator.
Days, weeks.

549
00:48:52,925 --> 00:48:57,504
Finally they think it's quite a bill. It
goes to the House of Representatives -

550
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,263
- For debate and a vote. But it has to
wait its turn on the calendar.

551
00:49:01,434 --> 00:49:05,348
That's the order of business.
Your bill has to stand in line -

552
00:49:05,521 --> 00:49:08,937
- Unless the steering committee
thinks it's important.

553
00:49:09,108 --> 00:49:11,314
What's the steering committee?

554
00:49:13,154 --> 00:49:16,487
- Do you think we're getting anywhere?
- Oh, yes, Miss Saunders.

555
00:49:16,657 --> 00:49:20,155
- What's the steering committee?
- Committee of the majority leaders.

556
00:49:20,326 --> 00:49:23,329
They decide if it's important
and should be moved up on the list.

557
00:49:23,498 --> 00:49:26,583
- This is.
- Pardon me... this is.

558
00:49:26,751 --> 00:49:30,500
- Where are we now?
- Over in the House.

559
00:49:30,672 --> 00:49:34,539
More amendments
and the bill goes back to the Senate.

560
00:49:34,717 --> 00:49:37,754
The Senate doesn't like
what the House did.

561
00:49:37,929 --> 00:49:41,298
The House doesn't like
what the Senate did... stymied.

562
00:49:41,474 --> 00:49:44,890
They appoint men from each House
to go into conference.

563
00:49:45,061 --> 00:49:49,854
They battle it out.
Finally, if your bill is still alive. -

564
00:49:50,025 --> 00:49:55,363
- It comes to a vote.
Yes, sir. The big day finally arrives -

565
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:58,530
And Congress adjourns.

566
00:50:01,703 --> 00:50:04,158
Catching on, Senator?

567
00:50:06,416 --> 00:50:09,333
Shall we start right away
or order dinner first?

568
00:50:09,502 --> 00:50:12,076
- Pardon me?
- I said, shall we start...

569
00:50:12,255 --> 00:50:17,332
Sure. Why not? Do you mind if I take
the time to go and get a pencil?

570
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:20,297
- Go right ahead.
- Thank you very much.

571
00:50:20,472 --> 00:50:22,464
And lots of paper too.

572
00:50:24,058 --> 00:50:28,270
Have you ever had so much to say
you just couldn't say it?

573
00:50:28,438 --> 00:50:31,011
Try sitting down.

574
00:50:31,191 --> 00:50:37,110
Let's get down to particulars. How big
is this thing? Where should it be?

575
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,279
- You have to have all that in it.
- Yes, and something else.

576
00:50:41,452 --> 00:50:47,324
The spirit of it.
The idea... how do you say it?

577
00:50:50,336 --> 00:50:54,084
That's what has got to be in it.
The capitol dome.

578
00:50:54,256 --> 00:50:58,918
- On paper?
- It should come to life for every boy.

579
00:50:59,094 --> 00:51:02,344
All lighted up too.

580
00:51:02,514 --> 00:51:05,764
Boys forget what their country means -

581
00:51:05,934 --> 00:51:09,019
- By just reading "Land of the Free"
in history books.

582
00:51:09,188 --> 00:51:12,058
Men forget even more.

583
00:51:12,232 --> 00:51:16,479
Liberty is too precious a thing
to be buried in books.

584
00:51:16,653 --> 00:51:21,280
Men should hold it up in front of them
every single day and say:

585
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:25,661
"I'm free... to think and to speak.

586
00:51:25,829 --> 00:51:30,206
My ancestors couldn't. I can.
And my children will."

587
00:51:32,502 --> 00:51:35,622
Boys ought to grow up remembering that.

588
00:51:35,797 --> 00:51:41,503
That steering committee have to see it
like that. I know Senator Paine'll help.

589
00:51:42,596 --> 00:51:48,100
He's a wonderful man.
He knew my father very well.

590
00:51:48,268 --> 00:51:52,597
We need a lot more like him.
His kind of characters, his ideals.

591
00:51:52,773 --> 00:51:55,561
Let's get on with this.

592
00:51:55,735 --> 00:52:01,691
- This camp is gonna be in your state.
- About 200 of the most beautiful acres.

593
00:52:01,867 --> 00:52:06,113
You've never been there, Miss Saunders?
I've been over every single foot.

594
00:52:06,287 --> 00:52:11,827
You have to see it for yourself.
The prairies, wind leaning on the grass.

595
00:52:12,001 --> 00:52:16,664
Lazy streams, angry little midges
of water up in the mountains...

596
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:23,755
Cattle moving down the slope against
the sun, campfires and snowdrifts...

597
00:52:25,473 --> 00:52:30,384
Everybody ought to have some of that.
My dad had the right idea.

598
00:52:30,561 --> 00:52:34,060
He had it all worked out. He said:

599
00:52:34,231 --> 00:52:38,099
"Son, don't miss the wonders
that surround you.

600
00:52:38,277 --> 00:52:42,191
Every tree, every rock,
every anthill, every star -

601
00:52:42,365 --> 00:52:45,650
Is filled with the wonders of nature."

602
00:52:45,826 --> 00:52:50,488
He said, "Have you ever noticed
how grateful you are to see daylight -

603
00:52:50,664 --> 00:52:54,496
- After coming through
a long dark tunnel?"

604
00:52:54,669 --> 00:53:01,086
"Well," he said, "always try to see life
as if you'd just come out of a tunnel."

605
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:09,465
- Where do you come from?
- I've always lived in a tunnel.

606
00:53:09,642 --> 00:53:13,806
- You mean here?
- Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.

607
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:18,061
- You've always had to work?
- Since I was about sixteen.

608
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:20,061
Your parents couldn't...?

609
00:53:20,237 --> 00:53:24,365
No, father was a doctor. He thought
more about ethics than collections.

610
00:53:24,532 --> 00:53:29,953
Speaks well for father, but it wasn't
so... We'd better get back to this.

611
00:53:30,121 --> 00:53:33,123
- It hasn't been easy, has it?
- No complaints.

612
00:53:33,292 --> 00:53:37,419
- For a woman you've done awfully well.
- Have I?

613
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:43,126
I've never known anyone
as capable and intelligent.

614
00:53:46,805 --> 00:53:51,217
I don't know where I'd be with this bill
if it wasn't for your help.

615
00:53:51,393 --> 00:53:57,763
- I don't know where you are with it...
- Oh, yes. Gee whiz, we gotta get going.

616
00:53:57,942 --> 00:54:00,645
All right, now. Let's see.

617
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:06,612
Everybody calls you plain Saunders,
why can't I?

618
00:54:06,783 --> 00:54:12,787
Saunders... Hello, Saunders.
Good morning, Saunders. Much better.

619
00:54:12,957 --> 00:54:16,159
- How's the bill coming, Saunders?
- Terrible.

620
00:54:16,334 --> 00:54:20,546
I've got that Saunders business
straightened out now.

621
00:54:22,507 --> 00:54:25,045
- What's your first name?
- Why?

622
00:54:25,218 --> 00:54:29,845
- Everybody just calls you Saunders.
- I also answer to whistles.

623
00:54:30,015 --> 00:54:34,808
- You have a first name, haven't you?
- Yes, but we'd better forget about it.

624
00:54:37,272 --> 00:54:39,395
Darn it... I was just curious.

625
00:54:39,566 --> 00:54:44,276
A picture popped into my mind
of a pump without a handle.

626
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:49,572
- I know what it is... Violet.
- No, it isn't.

627
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:52,069
- Abigail?
- No.

628
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:54,618
Letitia? Lena?

629
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:57,994
- No, stop it.
- You might as well tell me.

630
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:01,253
All right. You win.
It's Clarissa.

631
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,961
All right, Saunders. Let's go.

632
00:55:11,682 --> 00:55:17,637
- Susan's an awfully pretty name.
- Susan Paine? Oh, that's beautiful.

633
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:21,518
She's a beautiful woman.

634
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:27,113
She's probably the most beautiful girl
I've ever... No, Saunders.

635
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:32,488
We've got to get started on this. Get
set, I'll talk faster than you write.

636
00:55:32,661 --> 00:55:34,784
Are you ready?

637
00:55:34,955 --> 00:55:39,866
The location of this camp. About 200
acres situated in Terry Canyon -

638
00:55:40,043 --> 00:55:43,709
- Running on either side
of Willet Creek.

639
00:55:43,881 --> 00:55:47,879
- What?
- Willet Creek. Just a little stream.

640
00:55:48,052 --> 00:55:52,798
- In Terry Canyon?
- You don't know it, do you?

641
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:59,013
- You couldn't. You've never been there.
- You've discussed this with Paine?

642
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,182
No. Why?

643
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:05,141
Nothing. There's no reason
to talk it over with him.

644
00:56:05,319 --> 00:56:09,448
"A quarter of a mile
on either side of Willet Creek..."

645
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:13,566
The land to be bought
by the contributions from the boys. -

646
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:17,872
- The money to be loaned
by the government of the United States.

647
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:28,960
- What did you get me out of bed for?
- The show is about to commence.

648
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:34,805
- Mind telling me what's going on?
- There's the principal actor.

649
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:37,548
Don Quixote Smith. Man with a bill.

650
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:42,768
Over here, one of the supporting actors.
That gorilla in man's clothing, McGann.

651
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:47,437
- You mean puss in boots?
- Yes, mostly puss.

652
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:51,063
Another prominent character.
The Silver Knight.

653
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:55,950
- Soul of honour on a tight rope.
- You wouldn't be a little bit goofy?

654
00:56:56,121 --> 00:57:00,701
Don Quixote with bill will speak
two important words: Willet Creek.

655
00:57:00,877 --> 00:57:05,870
The knight will fall off his tightrope;
Puss will jump out of his boots.

656
00:57:09,844 --> 00:57:13,342
Introduction of new bills
and joint resolutions.

657
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,431
Mr President!

658
00:57:24,734 --> 00:57:29,857
The chair recognises the...
rather strong-lunged junior Senator.

659
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:32,486
Mr Smith.

660
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:36,441
- I'm sorry, I have a bill...
- Speak a little louder, Senator.

661
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,947
But not too loud.

662
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:44,869
I have a bill to propose, sir.

663
00:57:48,424 --> 00:57:54,676
Order, gentlemen. Ourjunior senator
is about to make a speech.

664
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:01,557
You may proceed, Senator.

665
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:11,401
Be it enacted by the Senate
and the House of Representatives -

666
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:16,825
- That there be appropriated
as a loan a sum sufficient -

667
00:58:16,995 --> 00:58:20,446
- To create a national boys' camp
to be paid back -

668
00:58:20,623 --> 00:58:25,332
- To the United States Treasury
by contributions from boys of America.

669
00:58:25,503 --> 00:58:31,873
This camp, to be situated on the land
at and adjacent to the stream -

670
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:35,717
- Known as Willet Creek
in Terry Canyon -

671
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:42,012
- For the purpose of bringing
together boys of all walks of life. -

672
00:58:42,187 --> 00:58:45,720
From various parts of the country.

673
00:58:45,898 --> 00:58:50,145
Boys of all creeds,
kinds and positions -

674
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:55,195
- To educate them in American ideals
and to promote mutual understanding -

675
00:58:55,367 --> 00:59:00,952
- And to bring about a healthful life
to the youth of this beautiful land.

676
00:59:43,624 --> 00:59:48,914
The Senator'll make a good orator
when his voice stops changing.

677
00:59:50,297 --> 00:59:54,591
I'm getting leery of this guy.
He keeps winding up in our hair.

678
00:59:54,759 --> 00:59:58,259
When he finds out our dam
is at his boys camp -

679
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:01,182
He'll start asking questions.

680
01:00:01,350 --> 01:00:06,724
Quiet. I have to think. This deficiency
bill will be read tomorrow.

681
01:00:06,897 --> 01:00:11,357
He'll hear that section on
the Willet dam. He can't be there!

682
01:00:11,526 --> 01:00:15,856
I'm taking him out to see monuments.
Might hit him on the head with one.

683
01:00:16,031 --> 01:00:19,649
It won't work.
This boy's honest, not stupid.

684
01:00:19,826 --> 01:00:21,486
Susan.

685
01:00:21,661 --> 01:00:25,327
My daughter doesn't carry out
assignments like that.

686
01:00:43,433 --> 01:00:47,098
Senator Smith,
if you'll let me handle publicity...

687
01:00:48,271 --> 01:00:50,846
Sit down, everybody.

688
01:00:56,489 --> 01:01:01,863
- Who are all those people?
- Washington plagues, office seekers...

689
01:01:02,036 --> 01:01:06,614
Now, this machine creates a fever
ten miles away, it'll make your fortune.

690
01:01:06,791 --> 01:01:08,914
Long distance fevers...

691
01:01:09,085 --> 01:01:13,296
A woman out there has composed a song
to replace "The Star-spangled Banner".

692
01:01:13,464 --> 01:01:17,331
I feel like a house on fire.
Even went down to see Mr Lincoln again.

693
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:21,424
How did I do?
My heart was right up to here.

694
01:01:21,597 --> 01:01:26,342
- What do you think Paine thought?
- He must have been tickled pink.

695
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:29,934
- What's all this?
- Contributions from boys.

696
01:01:30,105 --> 01:01:32,098
Already?

697
01:01:32,274 --> 01:01:36,568
Those are local. Wait till they start
pouring in from all over the country.

698
01:01:36,737 --> 01:01:40,569
We'd better open one up.
What does it say here?

699
01:01:41,575 --> 01:01:43,734
Look, money!

700
01:01:45,287 --> 01:01:48,822
"Dear Senator Smith.
I would like to come to your camp.

701
01:01:48,999 --> 01:01:52,617
I shine shoes at the station
and here's nine cents."

702
01:01:52,795 --> 01:01:56,246
Isn't that wonderful?
And he signs it:

703
01:01:56,423 --> 01:02:00,124
"Yours truly, Stinky Moore".
Isn't it marvellous?

704
01:02:00,302 --> 01:02:03,885
If there's money in each one...
What are we going to do with it?

705
01:02:04,056 --> 01:02:07,260
- Here you are.
- That's perfect.

706
01:02:07,435 --> 01:02:10,389
You see how important
this bill's going to be?

707
01:02:10,563 --> 01:02:14,229
- Do I have any paper around here?
- Second drawer.

708
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,900
- I'll be pretty busy tonight.
- Not another bill?

709
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:22,899
No, letters. I'm busting with news!
I introduced a bill!

710
01:02:23,076 --> 01:02:26,990
- I got up and spoke in the Senate!
- You want to dictate them?

711
01:02:27,163 --> 01:02:31,706
No, I couldn't talk letters, I have to
sit here and scratch them down.

712
01:02:32,919 --> 01:02:35,706
I'm going to tell Ma all about you.

713
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:40,708
If I tell it right, you'll get the best
jar of preserves you ever tasted.

714
01:02:40,885 --> 01:02:44,136
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, and Saunders...

715
01:02:45,515 --> 01:02:49,844
- Gee whiz, I forgot to thank you.
- Don't mention it.

716
01:02:50,019 --> 01:02:54,977
No, no, without you I couldn't have...
I mean...

717
01:03:01,239 --> 01:03:03,812
- Who?
- Susan Paine.

718
01:03:03,991 --> 01:03:06,863
How do you do?
I can talk. Go right ahead.

719
01:03:07,037 --> 01:03:13,324
Sorry to bother you, but I'm elected to
snatch Smith from the Senate tomorrow.

720
01:03:18,756 --> 01:03:23,753
I'm to take him out
and turn my glamour on for him.

721
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:29,469
Take him out and buy some clothes
and a hat that he can hang on to.

722
01:03:29,644 --> 01:03:32,727
A manicure and a haircut
wouldn't do any harm.

723
01:03:32,896 --> 01:03:36,479
I hate to ask you to do this,
but...

724
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:39,935
- As one woman to another, of course.
- Thanks, Saunders.

725
01:03:40,112 --> 01:03:46,317
- Just a minute. Miss Paine.
- Susan Paine?

726
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:51,574
- She wants to talk to me?
- Yes.

727
01:03:54,669 --> 01:03:56,625
Holy mackerel.

728
01:03:58,755 --> 01:04:01,793
Hello, Miss Paine.
How are you?

729
01:04:02,843 --> 01:04:05,547
Yes... Fine.

730
01:04:08,099 --> 01:04:09,842
What?

731
01:04:13,186 --> 01:04:15,512
Would escort you?

732
01:04:18,316 --> 01:04:23,478
Yes, I'd be... delighted.
Yes, all right.

733
01:04:24,782 --> 01:04:27,782
Reception for a princess.
She wants me to...

734
01:04:27,951 --> 01:04:30,109
Goodbye, Miss Paine.

735
01:04:31,998 --> 01:04:36,041
She wants me to go to a reception
for a princess. Imagine her asking me!

736
01:04:36,209 --> 01:04:40,339
Get your hat, Senator.
We have a lot of shopping to do.

737
01:04:41,966 --> 01:04:46,344
- Where are your bitters?
- Behind the sink.

738
01:04:46,513 --> 01:04:49,679
I don't mind who gets licked
in a fair fight.

739
01:04:52,059 --> 01:04:57,516
It's the clouts below the belt I can't
take. Sicking that horrible dame on him.

740
01:04:57,690 --> 01:05:01,059
- When he's goofy about her.
- What dame?

741
01:05:01,235 --> 01:05:03,394
Paine.

742
01:05:04,989 --> 01:05:09,367
Be nice to that girl. Her old man is
the party choice for the White House.

743
01:05:09,536 --> 01:05:12,109
She may be the next first lady.

744
01:05:12,289 --> 01:05:16,785
Imagine reading "My Day"
by Susan Paine-in-the-Neck.

745
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:22,380
As if he isn't going to be hurt enough,
she has to twist a knife in him too.

746
01:05:22,548 --> 01:05:26,547
- "I'll turn my glamour on him."
- What's it to you?

747
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:30,052
- Nothing.
- Then stop worrying.

748
01:05:30,222 --> 01:05:33,307
The dopes are going to
inherit the earth anyway.

749
01:05:33,476 --> 01:05:37,936
Maybe this Don Quixote has got
the jump on all of us.

750
01:05:38,105 --> 01:05:41,854
I wonder if it isn't a curse
to be wised up like you and me.

751
01:05:42,027 --> 01:05:46,272
If you're going to wonder,
let's go and do it over a steak.

752
01:05:46,447 --> 01:05:51,441
Snap out of it. Drink up.
Here's to bigger and better dopes.

753
01:05:52,494 --> 01:05:54,653
And to Don Quixote.

754
01:05:55,958 --> 01:05:59,326
- Do you know how I felt?
- How did you feel? Quick!

755
01:05:59,502 --> 01:06:06,336
I felt just like a mother sending the
kid off to school for the first time.

756
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:12,180
Watching her little fellow toddling off
in his best bib and tucker.

757
01:06:12,349 --> 01:06:16,428
Hoping he can stand up
to the other kids.

758
01:06:21,066 --> 01:06:23,687
Say, who started this?

759
01:06:24,736 --> 01:06:29,445
- I'm just waiting for a streetcar.
- Cut it out.

760
01:06:31,492 --> 01:06:35,573
- Who cares anyway?
- I apologise.

761
01:06:35,748 --> 01:06:40,455
All right, then.
After all, what's it to me?

762
01:06:40,626 --> 01:06:45,170
They drop him out of a balloon.
I just don't want to be around.

763
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:48,210
I'm squeamish.
That's what I am.

764
01:06:50,262 --> 01:06:55,967
I won't be party to no murder.
I quit. I'm through!

765
01:06:56,143 --> 01:06:59,559
Again? It's a good idea.

766
01:07:08,946 --> 01:07:11,617
- Diz...
- Yes.

767
01:07:11,783 --> 01:07:16,908
- Let's get married.
- It's a good idea. When?

768
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:20,533
- Any time.
- Tonight?

769
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:25,620
- Okay, you don't mind?
- I'd cherish you.

770
01:07:27,842 --> 01:07:31,045
- You're a good egg, Diz.
- I know.

771
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:36,297
Maybe we could clear out of this town.
Get to feel like people.

772
01:07:37,935 --> 01:07:42,147
- Live like we just got out of a tunnel.
- A tunnel?

773
01:07:45,526 --> 01:07:51,232
You've never seen prairie grass
with the wind leaning on it, have you?

774
01:07:51,407 --> 01:07:54,325
Does the wind get tired out there?

775
01:07:56,536 --> 01:08:03,038
Or angry little mountain streams,
or the sun moving against the cattle.

776
01:08:04,336 --> 01:08:09,414
- You've never seen anything like that?
- Have you?

777
01:08:09,592 --> 01:08:11,833
No.

778
01:08:14,472 --> 01:08:17,010
Do we have to?

779
01:08:18,017 --> 01:08:22,478
- I can't think of anything more sappy.
- Okay, then let's get going.

780
01:08:22,647 --> 01:08:26,229
- Where?
- We're getting married.

781
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:28,689
Yes, that's right.

782
01:08:28,861 --> 01:08:34,780
In case you don't know, you get the
chance to back out if you don't like it.

783
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:38,285
- My first name is Clarissa.
- I know, it's okay.

784
01:08:39,831 --> 01:08:44,908
- Don't say "okay", say it's beautiful.
- Okay. I mean...

785
01:08:45,086 --> 01:08:48,835
You don't know any name
offhand you like better?

786
01:08:49,007 --> 01:08:53,468
- No, not offhand.
- Nothing like Susan or any of that?

787
01:08:53,637 --> 01:08:56,424
Susan? Nah!

788
01:08:56,598 --> 01:09:00,809
I won't take it!
I won't be party to murder!

789
01:09:00,977 --> 01:09:05,722
Steering a poor dope up blind alleys
for that grafting Taylor mob is enough.

790
01:09:05,898 --> 01:09:09,019
But helping that dame
cut him in little pieces...

791
01:09:09,194 --> 01:09:12,858
- Nobody's gonna make me do that!
- You said it.

792
01:09:13,030 --> 01:09:17,693
I want to get out of there right now.
Bonus or no bonus.

793
01:09:17,869 --> 01:09:21,997
I'm clearing out of that office
everything I own.

794
01:09:22,165 --> 01:09:26,079
Hey, wait a minute!
We're getting married!

795
01:09:26,836 --> 01:09:28,792
See you later.

796
01:09:44,269 --> 01:09:47,557
- What do you want?
- Boy, you should have been there.

797
01:09:47,733 --> 01:09:53,154
It was a wonderful party. Your suit
went over big, she looked beautiful.

798
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:56,905
When you left, she said,
"Thank you, Mr Smith."

799
01:09:57,076 --> 01:10:01,405
But it was the way she said it.
You nearly fell through the floor.

800
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:03,703
Horseradish!

801
01:10:11,799 --> 01:10:15,168
What are you looking at?
Did you think I was a lady?

802
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:19,922
A lady wouldn't work for this outfit.
Even I can't take this. I quit!

803
01:10:20,099 --> 01:10:24,677
There are a lot of things I can't take.
Can't take a simple...

804
01:10:27,356 --> 01:10:33,145
Why don't you go home?
Tell your little streams about the camp.

805
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:36,736
This is no place for you.
You're halfway decent.

806
01:10:36,907 --> 01:10:40,655
Go home!
That's all I want to tell you.

807
01:10:41,954 --> 01:10:44,705
Meet the man I'm going to marry.

808
01:10:46,667 --> 01:10:49,039
That's me.

809
01:10:49,795 --> 01:10:53,246
Say something.
Don't just stand there like a...

810
01:10:54,675 --> 01:10:58,257
Wait a minute.
Why don't I do this right?

811
01:10:59,096 --> 01:11:02,466
You want to be a senator
and build a camp on Willet Creek.

812
01:11:02,642 --> 01:11:06,556
See this? Deficiency bill.
Section number 40.

813
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:09,516
A dam where you think
your camp's going to be.

814
01:11:09,691 --> 01:11:13,854
Ever hear of it? No. They read
all about it in the Senate today. -

815
01:11:14,028 --> 01:11:18,108
- But you weren't suppose to hear.
That's why that dame took you in tow.

816
01:11:18,282 --> 01:11:22,660
That's why they sent you here.
You don't know a dam from a bathtub.

817
01:11:22,829 --> 01:11:27,325
Go ahead, be a senator.
Mess up Mr Taylor's little graft.

818
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:32,328
But if you can't...
and you can't in nine million years. -

819
01:11:33,381 --> 01:11:38,043
- Go home! Don't stay around here
making people feel sorry for you.

820
01:11:39,095 --> 01:11:40,969
Come on, Diz.

821
01:11:45,768 --> 01:11:47,809
Hey, this way!

822
01:11:51,357 --> 01:11:54,727
Come on, kid. We'll dig up a preacher.

823
01:11:56,112 --> 01:12:00,441
- We're gonna get married.
- Oh, yeah.

824
01:12:05,079 --> 01:12:08,863
Okay. Come on, I'll take you home.

825
01:12:17,551 --> 01:12:21,798
There are a hundred other places
that really need the water!

826
01:12:21,972 --> 01:12:26,302
I talked to the owner of the land.
He didn't say anything about a dam.

827
01:12:26,477 --> 01:12:29,014
Doggone, I know there's something wrong!

828
01:12:29,187 --> 01:12:32,354
I won't vote on it
until I get my questions answered.

829
01:12:32,524 --> 01:12:34,647
You're fighting windmills.

830
01:12:34,818 --> 01:12:39,776
You try to understand a project it took
two years to set up. The benefits.

831
01:12:39,948 --> 01:12:43,151
- The benefits... Who's Taylor?
- What?

832
01:12:43,326 --> 01:12:46,944
- What's he got to do with this thing?
- Why should he be involved?

833
01:12:47,122 --> 01:12:51,369
I've been told the whole thing
is his idea to get graft.

834
01:12:54,129 --> 01:12:59,550
Are you accusing me of helping to
frame a bill for the benefit of one man?

835
01:12:59,718 --> 01:13:03,003
To put through a scheme for graft?

836
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:07,640
Long distance?
Get me Mr James Taylor, Jackson City.

837
01:13:07,809 --> 01:13:12,388
Boy ranger, answer to our prayer.
Didn't even know the time of day, huh?

838
01:13:12,565 --> 01:13:14,473
Exactly what has he done?

839
01:13:14,649 --> 01:13:18,778
He's about to blow the whole machine
to smithereens and you with it!

840
01:13:18,946 --> 01:13:21,436
- How?
- You wouldn't understand that.

841
01:13:21,614 --> 01:13:25,149
In about half an hour
I'll be on my way to Washington. -

842
01:13:25,326 --> 01:13:29,953
- And I'm all ready for that boy ranger.
Never mind how.

843
01:13:30,123 --> 01:13:35,000
You take your instructions from Allen.
I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp!

844
01:13:35,172 --> 01:13:38,041
Use your high office
to help Allen get things done.

845
01:13:38,215 --> 01:13:40,291
- Understand?
- Yes, Jim.

846
01:13:40,467 --> 01:13:42,046
I doubt it.

847
01:13:42,554 --> 01:13:46,597
I haven't been able to
show him a single monument!

848
01:13:46,765 --> 01:13:50,052
He's been on our tail.
You've got to keep him off us.

849
01:13:50,228 --> 01:13:54,225
Since he found out we're behind it,
he's been running us ragged.

850
01:13:54,398 --> 01:13:57,934
I told you I'd handle him.
I object to you coming here.

851
01:13:58,111 --> 01:14:02,439
You proved how you can handle him.
You started him writing bills.

852
01:14:03,407 --> 01:14:06,859
- That's him. Let him in.
- You didn't ask Smith here?

853
01:14:07,036 --> 01:14:10,784
- What do you think?
- Don't open that door, Chick.

854
01:14:10,956 --> 01:14:14,622
- You can't do this.
- Let him in, Chick.

855
01:14:14,794 --> 01:14:18,079
All right, Jim. Count me out.

856
01:14:21,634 --> 01:14:24,718
Good morning, Senator. Come right in.

857
01:14:29,934 --> 01:14:32,603
What did you mean "count me out"?

858
01:14:32,769 --> 01:14:37,397
You can't pull that steamroller stuff.
Your methods won't do here.

859
01:14:37,567 --> 01:14:41,943
However it happened, this boy's
a Senator. This is Washington, Jim!

860
01:14:42,112 --> 01:14:47,451
My steamroller methods don't go here?
They've done pretty well by you.

861
01:14:47,617 --> 01:14:50,703
This boy is different.
He's honest.

862
01:14:50,872 --> 01:14:54,288
He thinks the world of me.
We can't do this to him!

863
01:14:54,459 --> 01:14:57,993
Should I just stand around
and let that drooling infant -

864
01:14:58,172 --> 01:15:01,836
- Wrap that Willet Creek dam
appropriation around my neck?

865
01:15:02,008 --> 01:15:04,415
Not me.

866
01:15:04,594 --> 01:15:10,632
Either he falls in line or I'll break
him so open they won't find the pieces.

867
01:15:10,808 --> 01:15:15,352
- Jim, I won't stand for it.
- You won't stand for it?

868
01:15:15,522 --> 01:15:20,682
I don't want any part of
crucifying this boy.

869
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:27,479
Our steamroller methods are getting
too hard for your sensitive soul?

870
01:15:27,658 --> 01:15:31,408
The Silver Knight
is getting too big for us.

871
01:15:32,581 --> 01:15:35,664
My methods have been all right
for the past twenty years.

872
01:15:35,833 --> 01:15:38,503
Since I picked you out
of a hole in the wall -

873
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:42,963
- And blew you up to look like
a senator. And now you can't stand it.

874
01:15:43,132 --> 01:15:48,838
Maybe you don't have to. You and
the boy ranger can go home together.

875
01:15:49,013 --> 01:15:52,846
- Jim, you don't have to...
- It's all right.

876
01:15:53,018 --> 01:15:57,679
Seems a shame to part company
after all these years.

877
01:15:57,855 --> 01:16:02,482
Especially now
with a national convention coming up.

878
01:16:03,694 --> 01:16:08,773
I put everything I have behind you
and so did all of our friends.

879
01:16:10,328 --> 01:16:15,535
We'll survive. We just have to find
someone else with more sense.

880
01:16:15,708 --> 01:16:20,286
You go in and explain to Mr Smith
about Willet dam.

881
01:16:20,462 --> 01:16:23,298
It's your bill. It's your reputation.

882
01:16:23,466 --> 01:16:28,969
If he can't find enough facts to
break you with, I'll give him a couple.

883
01:16:29,137 --> 01:16:33,218
I'm taking the next plane home.
So long.

884
01:16:40,775 --> 01:16:43,062
Come here, will you.

885
01:16:51,201 --> 01:16:56,623
It's just that I like the kid. I don't
want to see you get rough on him.

886
01:16:58,208 --> 01:17:03,286
I'm glad to see you come to your senses.
You had me scared for a minute.

887
01:17:03,464 --> 01:17:07,710
You go back to your office.
I'll call when I'm through with Smith.

888
01:17:19,563 --> 01:17:22,516
The Silver Knight!

889
01:17:29,239 --> 01:17:33,190
Senator, I was just passing through
I thought I'd like to meet you.

890
01:17:33,370 --> 01:17:35,742
You've met all the boys, I suppose?

891
01:17:35,914 --> 01:17:40,623
They tell me you've been on your toes
since you got here.

892
01:17:40,794 --> 01:17:45,953
Some people told me you were dumb.
I think you're smart.

893
01:17:46,131 --> 01:17:51,043
Smart enough to understand a situation
when it's explained to you.

894
01:17:51,221 --> 01:17:54,921
For instance,
building a dam on Willet Creek.

895
01:17:55,099 --> 01:17:58,385
What's your interest in this?

896
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:04,066
Anything that benefits the state
is mighty important to me.

897
01:18:04,234 --> 01:18:07,684
Owning a lot of its industry
and newspapers.

898
01:18:07,861 --> 01:18:11,730
If you had the welfare of the state
at heart, like I have. -

899
01:18:11,908 --> 01:18:14,944
I'd say you were a man to watch.

900
01:18:15,786 --> 01:18:18,492
What do you like? Business?

901
01:18:18,665 --> 01:18:22,876
If you like business, you can pick
any job and go right to the top.

902
01:18:23,044 --> 01:18:26,329
Or politics.
If you like being a senator. -

903
01:18:26,506 --> 01:18:30,965
- You can come back to the Senate
and stay there as long as you want to.

904
01:18:31,134 --> 01:18:35,465
If you're smart.
Take the boys here or Joe Paine.

905
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:41,265
They're doing all right.
They don't worry about being re-elected.

906
01:18:41,438 --> 01:18:45,270
They're smart.
They take my advice.

907
01:18:45,442 --> 01:18:48,977
You tell these men and
Senator Paine what to do?

908
01:18:49,154 --> 01:18:54,314
Joe Paine has been taking my advice
for the past twenty years.

909
01:18:56,203 --> 01:18:59,120
You're a liar.

910
01:19:07,172 --> 01:19:10,790
- I have to see Senator Paine.
- Senator Paine is out of town.

911
01:19:10,968 --> 01:19:13,174
He couldn't be.

912
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:21,634
Hello, Jeff. Come in.
Did you have a talk with Taylor?

913
01:19:21,812 --> 01:19:26,770
He said he'd told you what to do
for twenty years. I called him a liar.

914
01:19:27,943 --> 01:19:32,190
- Come over here and sit down, son.
- I don't feel like sitting down.

915
01:19:32,364 --> 01:19:37,405
I know how you feel.
I was hoping you'd be spared all this.

916
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:44,077
That you'd see the sights, absorb a lot
of history and go back to your boys.

917
01:19:44,251 --> 01:19:48,035
You've been living in a boy's world.
For heaven's sake, stay there!

918
01:19:48,213 --> 01:19:51,629
This is a man's world, a brutal world.
You have no place in it.

919
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:57,043
You'll only get hurt. Forget Taylor
and what he said about the dam.

920
01:19:57,222 --> 01:20:03,178
But you still haven't answered me.
Can Taylor tell you what to do?

921
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:10,067
Now... listen, please.
And try to understand.

922
01:20:10,236 --> 01:20:12,561
It's tough to run head-on into facts. -

923
01:20:12,738 --> 01:20:18,195
- But you must check your ideals outside
the door like you do your rubbers.

924
01:20:19,954 --> 01:20:25,494
Thirty years ago, I had your ideals.
I was you.

925
01:20:25,668 --> 01:20:29,748
I had to make the same decision
you were asked to make today.

926
01:20:29,922 --> 01:20:33,587
I made it. I compromised.

927
01:20:33,759 --> 01:20:39,679
So that I could sit in that Senate
and serve the people in an honest way.

928
01:20:39,849 --> 01:20:44,511
You've gotta face facts.
I've served our state well, haven't I?

929
01:20:44,687 --> 01:20:48,850
We have the lowest unemployment
and the highest federal grants, but -

930
01:20:49,024 --> 01:20:53,686
- I've had to compromise.
You can't count on people voting.

931
01:20:53,863 --> 01:20:56,021
Half the time they don't vote.

932
01:20:56,198 --> 01:21:00,148
That's how states and empires
have been built since time began.

933
01:21:04,415 --> 01:21:09,540
You can take my word for it.
That's how things are.

934
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:17,633
I've told you all this because...
I've grown very fond of you.

935
01:21:17,804 --> 01:21:24,008
About like a son, in fact.
I don't want to see you get hurt.

936
01:21:26,271 --> 01:21:30,565
When that deficiency bill
comes up tomorrow, don't say a word.

937
01:21:30,733 --> 01:21:34,149
There are great powers behind it.
They'll destroy you.

938
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:39,232
For your own sake, and for the sake
of my friendship with your father. -

939
01:21:39,409 --> 01:21:43,241
Please... don't say a word.

940
01:21:50,962 --> 01:21:55,838
Owing to the urgency of the deficiency
bill, there's a unanimous agreement -

941
01:21:56,009 --> 01:22:01,086
- That no senator will speak for more
than five minutes on any section.

942
01:22:02,098 --> 01:22:04,221
The clerk will read.

943
01:22:04,392 --> 01:22:08,224
The bill providing for deficiency
appropriations for the fiscal year.

944
01:22:08,396 --> 01:22:12,346
Section one: Emergency relief.
To create public improvements -

945
01:22:12,525 --> 01:22:15,976
- On rivers, harbours and roadways.
150 billion dollars.

946
01:22:16,154 --> 01:22:19,605
Section 40: An appropriation for
diverting and impounding -

947
01:22:19,782 --> 01:22:23,862
- The headwaters of Willet Creek
in Terry Canyon. 5 million dollars.

948
01:22:24,036 --> 01:22:25,531
Mr President.

949
01:22:25,705 --> 01:22:29,204
Senator Smith desires to be heard
on Section 40?

950
01:22:29,375 --> 01:22:33,421
Does the Senator understand
he's limited to five minutes?

951
01:22:33,589 --> 01:22:36,424
You may proceed, sir.

952
01:22:36,592 --> 01:22:41,799
Mr President, this section on the dam
on Willet Creek is nothing but...

953
01:22:41,972 --> 01:22:46,220
Does Senator Smith wish to
yield to his colleague Senator Paine?

954
01:22:46,394 --> 01:22:49,311
- Yes, sir.
- You may proceed, Senator.

955
01:22:49,479 --> 01:22:52,684
I have risen to a difficult task.

956
01:22:52,859 --> 01:22:55,609
Evidence has come to our attention -

957
01:22:55,777 --> 01:23:00,156
- That Senator Smith is unworthy
to address this body.

958
01:23:01,618 --> 01:23:03,775
Get the senators.

959
01:23:05,954 --> 01:23:08,624
Something's going on inside. Come on.

960
01:23:12,085 --> 01:23:16,084
The Senator will please suspend
until order is restored in the chamber.

961
01:23:16,257 --> 01:23:18,829
All the senators
are wanted on the floor.

962
01:23:23,806 --> 01:23:25,881
What's going on, Joe?

963
01:23:37,652 --> 01:23:39,527
You may proceed, Senator.

964
01:23:39,697 --> 01:23:44,192
I refer to the bill he has introduced
for the creation of a boys' camp.

965
01:23:44,367 --> 01:23:47,738
He named a certain portion of land -

966
01:23:47,915 --> 01:23:52,291
- To be bought by contributions
from boys all over America.

967
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:59,209
Senators, I have evidence that he owns
the very land described in his bill.

968
01:24:04,014 --> 01:24:07,596
He bought it the day following
his appointment to the Senate -

969
01:24:07,767 --> 01:24:11,682
- And is using his privileged office
for his own personal profit!

970
01:24:18,069 --> 01:24:21,402
- Boy ranger had a racket.
- This doesn't make sense.

971
01:24:23,282 --> 01:24:27,576
Accordingly, I offer a resolution
for an immediate inquiry -

972
01:24:27,745 --> 01:24:33,582
- As to the fitness of my colleague
to continue to sit in this chamber.

973
01:24:34,628 --> 01:24:36,750
Mr President, I...

974
01:24:40,592 --> 01:24:45,383
Order... The chair will clear the
galleries unless order is restored.

975
01:24:49,893 --> 01:24:52,727
Ranger Senator branded
by colleague Senator Paine!

976
01:24:52,895 --> 01:24:55,601
Senator Paine to expel Senator Smith.

977
01:24:55,774 --> 01:24:57,850
Saunders must have the low-down on this.

978
01:24:58,026 --> 01:25:00,516
She packed up and left town.

979
01:25:00,694 --> 01:25:05,987
Paine accuses Smith of introducing
a boys camp bill for his own profit!

980
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:12,364
Paine's asked for a hearing before the
Committee of Privileges and Elections.

981
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:14,449
Frankly, my dear Senators. -

982
01:25:14,626 --> 01:25:17,745
- When Mr Kenneth Allen
burst into my office -

983
01:25:17,922 --> 01:25:23,128
- And proved that Jeff Smith had
a deed to that site, I was dumbfounded.

984
01:25:23,301 --> 01:25:27,051
What did you do
when it was brought to your attention?

985
01:25:27,223 --> 01:25:31,634
I consulted with the head of the
Department of Records, Mr Arthur Kim.

986
01:25:31,809 --> 01:25:35,061
Mr Kim,
do you remember recording such a deed?

987
01:25:35,231 --> 01:25:40,686
Yes. On the date set forth here,
Mr Allen came to record this deed. -

988
01:25:40,861 --> 01:25:44,360
- Setting over these 200 acres
in the name of Jefferson Smith.

989
01:25:44,531 --> 01:25:49,692
- How long have you known Senator Smith?
- A good many years.

990
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:54,116
He used my land up around Willet Creek
for his boy rangers.

991
01:25:54,290 --> 01:25:56,367
Seemed like a nice fellow.

992
01:25:56,543 --> 01:26:01,121
One day he said he had a great chance
to sell that land for 500 an acre.

993
01:26:01,297 --> 01:26:04,797
I'd be glad to get 25 for it.
So we set it up like this:

994
01:26:04,968 --> 01:26:09,345
I deeded him the land and
he guaranteed me half of what he got -

995
01:26:09,514 --> 01:26:14,556
- If he made the sale. The whole thing
sounded fishy at the time.

996
01:26:14,728 --> 01:26:18,178
Have you got that document?

997
01:26:18,356 --> 01:26:23,067
The land wouldn't be in his name if I
didn't. Yes, sir, signed and delivered.

998
01:26:23,238 --> 01:26:28,149
- I never signed any contract!
- He certainly did.

999
01:26:31,745 --> 01:26:36,242
After a long study of this signature,
it is my professional opinion -

1000
01:26:36,417 --> 01:26:40,331
- That it is definitely
in Jefferson Smith's own handwriting.

1001
01:26:40,504 --> 01:26:44,039
As an expert on handwriting,
I'd say the name Jefferson Smith -

1002
01:26:44,217 --> 01:26:46,790
- On this contract...
has been forged.

1003
01:26:46,968 --> 01:26:50,919
I would stake my whole
twenty year professional career -

1004
01:26:51,099 --> 01:26:54,302
- On the fact that
this is not a forgery. -

1005
01:26:54,477 --> 01:26:58,225
But is Mr Smith's own signature.

1006
01:26:58,399 --> 01:27:02,857
This is a very painful duty for me.
This boy is the son of my best friend.

1007
01:27:03,026 --> 01:27:06,063
I sponsored him in the Senate.
I helped him frame his bill.

1008
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:09,074
On the day he presented it,
I congratulated him.

1009
01:27:09,242 --> 01:27:14,200
But I pointed out that a dam was
going up on the very site he had chosen.

1010
01:27:14,372 --> 01:27:19,163
There are a hundred good campsites.
I suggested he choose another.

1011
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:22,669
He became furious and said,
"Move the dam!"

1012
01:27:22,838 --> 01:27:25,626
I was amazed at his violent reaction -

1013
01:27:25,799 --> 01:27:30,094
- Until the evidence came to me
that he owned those very 200 acres.

1014
01:27:30,263 --> 01:27:36,551
He'd laid plans to make an enormous
profit out of the nickels and dimes -

1015
01:27:36,729 --> 01:27:39,978
- Scraped together by the boys
of this country.

1016
01:27:40,148 --> 01:27:45,225
Faced with that... regardless of
my personal feelings for the boy. -

1017
01:27:45,404 --> 01:27:49,068
- My sense of duty told me
that his expulsion from the Senate -

1018
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:51,114
Was the only possible answer.

1019
01:27:51,284 --> 01:27:53,407
Beautiful, that Taylor machine...

1020
01:27:57,748 --> 01:27:59,789
Senator Smith, please.

1021
01:28:03,505 --> 01:28:06,541
Will you take the chair, please?

1022
01:28:16,768 --> 01:28:20,218
The committee is ready to hear you now,
Senator Smith.

1023
01:28:28,237 --> 01:28:32,022
Keep your seats, gentlemen.
The committee is not adjourned yet!

1024
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:33,991
Quiet, please!

1025
01:28:37,414 --> 01:28:41,577
That ranger never knew what struck him
when Jim Taylor opened up on him.

1026
01:28:41,751 --> 01:28:44,122
Which one of you girls wants this?

1027
01:28:47,424 --> 01:28:49,749
- Do you want it?
- Oh, yes!

1028
01:30:25,064 --> 01:30:26,973
Hello.

1029
01:30:28,401 --> 01:30:32,268
- Hello, Saunders.
- I had a hunch I'd find you here.

1030
01:30:32,447 --> 01:30:34,854
When you weren't any place else.

1031
01:30:38,035 --> 01:30:41,618
- How have you been, Saunders?
- All right.

1032
01:30:41,789 --> 01:30:47,129
- How is your husband?
- What? Oh, old Diz? We're not married.

1033
01:30:52,049 --> 01:30:56,379
It's a good thing I got back now.
You know what I found waiting for me?

1034
01:30:56,554 --> 01:31:00,801
- A jar of preserves from your mother.
- You did, huh?

1035
01:31:02,227 --> 01:31:06,556
Was it strawberry?
It's the best kind.

1036
01:31:06,731 --> 01:31:12,436
Well, I... see by the papers
you certainly got to be a Senator.

1037
01:31:13,696 --> 01:31:18,074
You had the right idea about me
when you told me to go back home -

1038
01:31:18,242 --> 01:31:20,816
And fill those kids full of hooey.

1039
01:31:22,538 --> 01:31:25,208
Just a simple guy,
still wet behind the ears.

1040
01:31:25,375 --> 01:31:31,627
Full of a lot ofjunk about American
ideals. A lot of junk all right...

1041
01:31:31,798 --> 01:31:37,006
- Now look, Senator...
- This is a whole new world to me.

1042
01:31:39,723 --> 01:31:42,392
What are you going to believe in?

1043
01:31:42,559 --> 01:31:46,010
When a man like Senator Joseph Paine
gets up and swears -

1044
01:31:46,188 --> 01:31:49,972
- That I've been robbing kids
of nickels and dimes.

1045
01:31:50,150 --> 01:31:53,898
A man I've admired and worshipped
all my life.

1046
01:31:54,070 --> 01:31:57,570
There are a lot of fancy words here.

1047
01:31:57,741 --> 01:32:02,153
Some of them are carved in stone, some
of them men like Taylor put up there. -

1048
01:32:02,329 --> 01:32:05,164
So suckers like me could read them.

1049
01:32:05,332 --> 01:32:08,783
Then you find out
what those men actually do.

1050
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,499
I'm getting out of this town so fast.

1051
01:32:11,672 --> 01:32:15,621
Away from all the words, the monuments,
the whole rotten show.

1052
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:18,126
I see.

1053
01:32:18,303 --> 01:32:23,546
- What will you tell the kids back home?
- The truth.

1054
01:32:23,725 --> 01:32:28,138
They might as well
find out now as later.

1055
01:32:28,313 --> 01:32:30,602
I don't think they'll believe you.

1056
01:32:30,774 --> 01:32:34,144
They're liable to look at you
with hurt faces and say:

1057
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:38,862
"Jeff, what did you do? Quit?
Didn't you do something about it?"

1058
01:32:39,032 --> 01:32:42,034
What do you expect me to do?

1059
01:32:42,203 --> 01:32:46,117
An honorary stooge like me
against the Taylors and Paines. -

1060
01:32:46,290 --> 01:32:48,579
The machines and the lies.

1061
01:32:48,751 --> 01:32:51,752
Your friend Mr Lincoln
had his Taylors and Paines.

1062
01:32:51,921 --> 01:32:55,788
So did every man who ever tried
to lift his thought up off the ground.

1063
01:32:55,966 --> 01:32:59,501
Odds against them didn't stop them,
they were fools that way.

1064
01:32:59,678 --> 01:33:04,257
All the good in this world
came from fools with faith like that.

1065
01:33:04,433 --> 01:33:08,478
You can't quit now. Not you.

1066
01:33:08,646 --> 01:33:14,151
They aren't all Taylors and Paines,
that kind just throw big shadows.

1067
01:33:14,319 --> 01:33:20,108
You didn'tjust have faith in Paine or
any other man. It was bigger than that.

1068
01:33:20,283 --> 01:33:24,991
You had plain, decent,
everyday common rightness.

1069
01:33:25,162 --> 01:33:27,950
This country could use some of that.

1070
01:33:28,124 --> 01:33:32,287
So could the whole cock-eyed world.
A lot of it.

1071
01:33:32,461 --> 01:33:36,839
Remember the first day you got here?
What you said about Mr Lincoln?

1072
01:33:37,008 --> 01:33:40,210
You said he was sitting there
waiting for someone.

1073
01:33:40,385 --> 01:33:45,546
You were right. He was waiting for a man
who could see his job and sail into it.

1074
01:33:45,724 --> 01:33:49,722
A man who could tear into the Taylors
and root them out into the open.

1075
01:33:49,895 --> 01:33:55,020
I think he was waiting for you, Jeff.
He knows you can do it, so do I.

1076
01:33:55,192 --> 01:33:57,350
Do what, Saunders?

1077
01:33:57,527 --> 01:34:02,570
Say you won't quit and I'll tell you.
I've been thinking about it all day.

1078
01:34:02,742 --> 01:34:08,034
It's a forty foot dive into a tub
of water, but I think you can do it.

1079
01:34:15,089 --> 01:34:19,796
- Clarissa... where can we get a drink?
- Now you're talking.

1080
01:34:19,967 --> 01:34:22,341
Come on over to my place.

1081
01:34:34,690 --> 01:34:39,815
Mr Dearborn?
Mr Durnell? Mr Dwight?

1082
01:34:39,987 --> 01:34:43,652
So they'll expel Smith today.
Where's the guillotine?

1083
01:34:43,824 --> 01:34:45,901
In fact, where's Smith?

1084
01:34:46,078 --> 01:34:49,861
Smith hasn't stopped running
since he left that committee room.

1085
01:34:50,039 --> 01:34:52,329
- Mr Smith?
- Here!

1086
01:35:00,842 --> 01:35:06,298
- That guy's batty!
- The clerk will continue the roll-call.

1087
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:18,605
Is this one of your shenanigans?
What's the matter?

1088
01:35:18,777 --> 01:35:23,772
- Pray, Diz. If you know how.
- Did you bring that guy in here?

1089
01:35:23,950 --> 01:35:26,108
Are you crazy?

1090
01:35:28,161 --> 01:35:31,163
90 senators
have answered to their names.

1091
01:35:31,332 --> 01:35:34,866
A quorum is present.
Proceeding now to the regular order.

1092
01:35:46,973 --> 01:35:49,807
- Mr President.
- Senator McPherson.

1093
01:35:49,975 --> 01:35:53,843
I desire to call up the report of the
Committee on Privileges and Elections -

1094
01:35:54,022 --> 01:35:56,808
On the expulsion of Jefferson Smith.

1095
01:36:00,151 --> 01:36:02,228
The clerk will read the report.

1096
01:36:02,405 --> 01:36:06,697
The Committee
on Privileges and Elections reports -

1097
01:36:06,866 --> 01:36:11,161
- After hearing a number of witnesses,
thatjustice to the Senate requires -

1098
01:36:11,330 --> 01:36:15,197
- That Jefferson Smith no longer
continue as a member of this body.

1099
01:36:15,375 --> 01:36:19,124
They therefore recommend
that the same do pass.

1100
01:36:19,296 --> 01:36:24,254
Resolved, that Jefferson Smith be
expelled from his seat in the Senate.

1101
01:36:28,388 --> 01:36:33,467
Mr President... I move for the
immediate adoption of the resolution.

1102
01:36:33,645 --> 01:36:36,680
- Mr President!
- I have the floor!

1103
01:36:36,855 --> 01:36:40,901
I'm about to ask for a roll-call
on the passage of the resolution.

1104
01:36:41,069 --> 01:36:43,985
The Senator has nothing to say
at this time!

1105
01:36:45,572 --> 01:36:48,195
Senator Smith is still a member -

1106
01:36:48,368 --> 01:36:52,281
- And as such has an equal claim
on the attention of this chair.

1107
01:36:52,454 --> 01:36:55,741
You were about to recognise me, sir.

1108
01:36:55,917 --> 01:36:58,075
Let him speak!

1109
01:37:02,132 --> 01:37:06,295
Before proceeding further,
I'll remind the visitors in the gallery -

1110
01:37:06,469 --> 01:37:10,681
- That they are here as our guests
and should conduct themselves as such.

1111
01:37:10,849 --> 01:37:15,972
Their sentiments will in no way affect
the judgement of this chair.

1112
01:37:22,110 --> 01:37:24,565
The chair recognises -

1113
01:37:25,738 --> 01:37:28,656
Senator Smith.

1114
01:37:30,993 --> 01:37:32,274
Here we go.

1115
01:37:32,453 --> 01:37:36,237
The gentlemen are in a hurry
to get me out of here.

1116
01:37:36,416 --> 01:37:40,413
The way the evidence is piled up
against me, I can't say I blame them.

1117
01:37:40,586 --> 01:37:42,579
I will go when they vote it that way.

1118
01:37:42,755 --> 01:37:46,538
But before that happens
I have a few things to say.

1119
01:37:46,717 --> 01:37:51,879
I've tried to say them before,
and I'd like to get them said this time.

1120
01:37:52,057 --> 01:37:54,891
I won't leave this body
until they're said.

1121
01:37:55,059 --> 01:37:59,354
- President, will the Senator yield?
- No, sir, I'm afraid not!

1122
01:38:01,066 --> 01:38:05,693
I yielded once before and was
practically never heard of again.

1123
01:38:08,198 --> 01:38:13,074
We might as well get together on
this yielding business right off the bat.

1124
01:38:15,622 --> 01:38:17,744
I had some good coaching last night -

1125
01:38:17,915 --> 01:38:21,831
- And if I yield only for a question
or a personal privilege -

1126
01:38:22,004 --> 01:38:25,039
I can hold this floor until doomsday!

1127
01:38:25,214 --> 01:38:29,628
I've got a piece to speak and
blow hot or cold, I'm gonna speak it!

1128
01:38:29,803 --> 01:38:32,637
- Will the Senator yield?
- Yield how?

1129
01:38:32,805 --> 01:38:35,048
- Yield for a question?
- All right.

1130
01:38:35,225 --> 01:38:38,724
I wish to ask
if this piece he intends to speak -

1131
01:38:38,895 --> 01:38:42,099
- Concerns Section 40,
that dam on Willet Creek?

1132
01:38:42,274 --> 01:38:46,770
Every aspect of this matter
was dealt with in committee hearing.

1133
01:38:46,945 --> 01:38:50,777
I wish to ask my colleague if he has
one scrap of evidence to add now -

1134
01:38:50,949 --> 01:38:54,069
- To the defence
he could not give at that hearing?

1135
01:38:54,244 --> 01:38:58,194
- I have no defence against forgery!
- The committee ruled otherwise!

1136
01:38:58,373 --> 01:39:02,869
The gentleman stands guilty as charged.
I believe that no member -

1137
01:39:03,044 --> 01:39:06,497
- Cares to hear
what a man of his condemned character -

1138
01:39:06,674 --> 01:39:10,541
- Has to say about any section
before this House!

1139
01:39:13,222 --> 01:39:16,887
I stand guilty as framed
because Section 40 is graft!

1140
01:39:17,059 --> 01:39:22,054
I was ready to tell you that a certain
man in my state, a Mr James Taylor. -

1141
01:39:22,231 --> 01:39:27,736
- Wanted this dam for his own profit.
A man who controls a political machine!

1142
01:39:27,904 --> 01:39:30,608
He controls everything else in my state!

1143
01:39:30,781 --> 01:39:33,735
He's powerful enough
to control congressmen.

1144
01:39:33,909 --> 01:39:36,282
I saw three of them in his room.

1145
01:39:36,454 --> 01:39:39,823
- Will the Senator yield?
- No, sir, I will not yield!

1146
01:39:42,543 --> 01:39:47,454
James Taylor offered me a seat in
this Senate for the next twenty years. -

1147
01:39:47,631 --> 01:39:51,415
- If I voted for a dam
that he knew, and I knew, was a fraud.

1148
01:39:51,594 --> 01:39:55,923
If I dared to speak against that dam,
he promised to break me in two.

1149
01:39:56,098 --> 01:40:01,259
I got up and started to speak
and the long powerful arm of Taylor -

1150
01:40:01,437 --> 01:40:05,684
- Reached into this sacred chamber
and grabbed me by the neck.

1151
01:40:05,858 --> 01:40:07,934
- Mr President, a point of order.
- Mr President...

1152
01:40:08,110 --> 01:40:12,149
- Senator Paine will state it.
- I rose in this chamber to accuse him.

1153
01:40:12,323 --> 01:40:15,573
He's saying
I carried out criminal orders!

1154
01:40:15,743 --> 01:40:19,990
He accuses me of unworthy conduct!
He should be made to yield the floor.

1155
01:40:20,164 --> 01:40:23,201
I did not say that Senator Paine was
one of the Congressmen in that room!

1156
01:40:23,376 --> 01:40:25,583
I was in that room!

1157
01:40:29,758 --> 01:40:33,672
I accuse this man.
By his tone, by his careful denials. -

1158
01:40:33,845 --> 01:40:37,463
- He has been trying to plant
damaging impression of my conduct.

1159
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:42,599
I'll tell you why we were in that room.
Mr Taylor, a respected citizen. -

1160
01:40:42,771 --> 01:40:47,183
- Had brought the evidence against
this man and we urged him to resign.

1161
01:40:47,358 --> 01:40:51,404
Why? To avoid bringing disgrace upon
a clean and honourable state.

1162
01:40:51,572 --> 01:40:53,943
- But he refused.
- Mr President, have I...

1163
01:40:54,115 --> 01:40:57,615
There was only one answer
to a man like him. The truth.

1164
01:40:57,786 --> 01:41:00,193
Which I rose and gave to this body.

1165
01:41:00,371 --> 01:41:04,950
He is trying to blackmail this Senate
as he tried to blackmail me.

1166
01:41:05,126 --> 01:41:08,744
To prevent his expulsion,
he'll hold up this deficiency bill. -

1167
01:41:08,922 --> 01:41:12,337
- Vital to this country,
which must be passed today!

1168
01:41:12,508 --> 01:41:16,589
- Have I the floor?
- I have lost all patience with him.

1169
01:41:16,763 --> 01:41:19,966
I apologise for his appointment.

1170
01:41:20,141 --> 01:41:23,724
I am sick and tired of
this contemptible young man!

1171
01:41:23,895 --> 01:41:26,646
I refuse to stay here and listen to him!

1172
01:41:26,814 --> 01:41:30,101
I hope every member of this body
feels as I do.

1173
01:41:30,277 --> 01:41:32,233
Yield the floor!

1174
01:41:34,655 --> 01:41:38,737
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen, please address the chair!

1175
01:41:38,911 --> 01:41:41,615
What does the gentleman want?

1176
01:41:41,789 --> 01:41:45,787
I want a chance to talk to people
who'll believe me.

1177
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:48,830
The people of my state
know me and Mr Taylor.

1178
01:41:49,004 --> 01:41:53,584
When they hear my story, they'll kick
Mr Taylor's machine to kingdom come.

1179
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:56,084
I want one week to bring you proof -

1180
01:41:56,261 --> 01:42:01,682
- And your promise that I will not be
expelled and the bill won't be passed.

1181
01:42:01,850 --> 01:42:04,009
- Will the Senator yield?
- For a question.

1182
01:42:04,186 --> 01:42:07,603
You have the effrontery
to stand there convicted -

1183
01:42:07,774 --> 01:42:11,853
- And try to force postponement
of the deficiency bill?

1184
01:42:12,027 --> 01:42:14,779
I appeal to the Senator.
Is he fully aware -

1185
01:42:14,947 --> 01:42:19,075
- That this bill has been months
in both Houses, delayed and delayed?

1186
01:42:19,242 --> 01:42:24,996
- Many'll be without food and shelter.
- Shall we keep relief from the country?

1187
01:42:25,165 --> 01:42:29,115
The people of my state
need permanent relief from crooked men!

1188
01:42:29,294 --> 01:42:33,458
If we yield to blackmail from this man,
we'll become a laughing stock!

1189
01:42:33,632 --> 01:42:37,795
It is an insult to this body
to have to listen to this.

1190
01:42:37,969 --> 01:42:42,133
I will follow the Senator's example
and refuse to remain in this chamber -

1191
01:42:42,307 --> 01:42:45,510
As long as that man holds the floor!

1192
01:42:55,239 --> 01:42:57,731
Order, gentlemen.

1193
01:42:57,907 --> 01:43:01,906
I guess I have to speak to the people
of my state from right here!

1194
01:43:03,663 --> 01:43:08,123
Wild horses won't drag me off this floor
till those people have heard me -

1195
01:43:08,292 --> 01:43:10,749
Even if it takes all winter.

1196
01:43:16,843 --> 01:43:19,050
Filibuster!

1197
01:43:32,859 --> 01:43:35,480
Well, Mr President, we seem to be alone.

1198
01:43:37,154 --> 01:43:40,192
I'm not complaining
for social reasons. -

1199
01:43:40,367 --> 01:43:44,280
- But it's a pity if these gentlemen
missed any of this.

1200
01:43:49,835 --> 01:43:51,873
And...

1201
01:43:58,968 --> 01:44:02,052
I call the chair's attention to -

1202
01:44:05,225 --> 01:44:10,183
- Rule 5 of the standing rules
of the Senate, Section 3.

1203
01:44:10,355 --> 01:44:13,191
"If it shall be found
that a quorum is not present. -

1204
01:44:13,358 --> 01:44:18,068
- A majority of the senators present...
and that looks like me. -

1205
01:44:21,157 --> 01:44:25,155
- May direct the serjeant-at-arms
to request, and if necessary, compel -

1206
01:44:25,329 --> 01:44:28,413
- The attendance of
the absent senators."

1207
01:44:28,582 --> 01:44:30,740
Mr President, I so direct.

1208
01:44:35,589 --> 01:44:39,372
The absence of a quorum
being suggested.

1209
01:44:39,551 --> 01:44:41,959
Ring the call to quorum.

1210
01:44:43,681 --> 01:44:47,464
There's no hurry, Mr President.
I've got plenty of time.

1211
01:44:49,563 --> 01:44:52,396
Quorum called! Quorum called!

1212
01:45:05,828 --> 01:45:07,736
The clerk will call the roll.

1213
01:45:07,912 --> 01:45:12,374
Mr Agnew? Mr Albert? Mr Alford?

1214
01:45:16,587 --> 01:45:19,506
Get this:
Smith got the floor and is holding it!

1215
01:45:19,675 --> 01:45:22,878
- Just as they were to kick him out!
- Isn't it wonderful?!

1216
01:45:23,053 --> 01:45:26,921
It's terrific! A filibuster!
This is the miracle I wanted.

1217
01:45:27,099 --> 01:45:30,385
Get everything he's saying
back to that home state!

1218
01:45:30,562 --> 01:45:35,769
They're going to hear this in Patagonia!
In protest the Senate walked out...

1219
01:45:35,942 --> 01:45:39,773
No, not that straight stuff!
Kick it up! Get on his side!

1220
01:45:39,945 --> 01:45:44,240
- You love this monkey, don't you?
- What do you think? Now go to work.

1221
01:45:44,409 --> 01:45:49,200
It's the most titanic battle of modern
times! A David without a slingshot -

1222
01:45:49,371 --> 01:45:53,073
- Rises to battle the mighty Goliath,
the Taylor machine. -

1223
01:45:53,251 --> 01:45:58,328
- Allegedly crooked inside and out!...
For my money, cut out "allegedly".

1224
01:45:58,506 --> 01:46:02,372
We're bringing everybody up
from state headquarters.

1225
01:46:05,179 --> 01:46:08,050
- Did you get Hendricks?
- They're looking for him.

1226
01:46:08,224 --> 01:46:12,268
Why isn't he at his desk?
Don't you think you'd better get back?

1227
01:46:12,437 --> 01:46:17,182
The boy is talking to the state.
He can raise public opinion against us.

1228
01:46:17,357 --> 01:46:21,272
He'll never get started.
I'll make public opinion out there.

1229
01:46:21,446 --> 01:46:25,394
I've done it all my life.
I'll blacken this punk so he'll...

1230
01:46:25,574 --> 01:46:30,402
You leave public opinion to me.
You better go back into the Senate.

1231
01:46:30,580 --> 01:46:33,864
I hit him from the floor
with everything I knew.

1232
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:37,208
I haven't got the stomach for it.

1233
01:46:37,378 --> 01:46:42,086
If he starts convincing those senators,
you might as well blow your brains out!

1234
01:46:42,257 --> 01:46:47,170
This is the works! Either we're out of
business or bigger than ever before.

1235
01:46:47,347 --> 01:46:51,131
We can't stop at anything
until we've smashed this yokel...

1236
01:46:51,310 --> 01:46:54,310
Go back to the Senate, Joe.

1237
01:46:54,479 --> 01:46:59,437
The chips are down. I want you
to keep everything that Smith says -

1238
01:46:59,609 --> 01:47:04,685
- Out of all our newspapers and all the
others you can line up in the state.

1239
01:47:04,864 --> 01:47:09,610
Those broken-down opposition papers
who don't want to play ball with us. -

1240
01:47:09,786 --> 01:47:13,450
I want you to tie up for 24 hours.

1241
01:47:13,623 --> 01:47:17,039
Stall their deliveries,
push them off the streets!

1242
01:47:17,210 --> 01:47:22,168
Bury them for 24 hours, give me time!
You defend the machine. Hit this guy!

1243
01:47:22,340 --> 01:47:26,208
The usual thing, criminal,
blocking a relief bill. -

1244
01:47:26,386 --> 01:47:30,680
- Starving the people.
Joe, will you get back into that Senate!

1245
01:47:33,226 --> 01:47:37,805
Get the hoi polloi excited.
Have them send protests, letters...

1246
01:47:37,981 --> 01:47:41,314
Buy up every minute
of every radio station in the state -

1247
01:47:41,484 --> 01:47:44,057
And keep them spouting against Smith.

1248
01:47:44,237 --> 01:47:47,653
I don't care what it costs!
Get the whole state moving!

1249
01:47:53,371 --> 01:47:59,206
This filibuster is a cowardly attempt to
turn your attention from the true facts.

1250
01:47:59,376 --> 01:48:02,463
Smith was caught red-handed
stealing from boys.

1251
01:48:02,631 --> 01:48:05,169
Relief will be stopped.

1252
01:48:15,394 --> 01:48:18,597
- I've seen filibustering...
- This can't go on, it's ridiculous.

1253
01:48:18,772 --> 01:48:21,061
We've got to get this man off the floor.

1254
01:48:21,233 --> 01:48:26,144
As long as Mr Smith holds that floor
legitimately, he'll continue to hold it.

1255
01:48:26,322 --> 01:48:29,073
That fellow is making a lot of sense.

1256
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:31,911
You call blackmail sense, Henry?

1257
01:48:32,077 --> 01:48:36,704
I didn't like this boy to begin with,
but no man that wasn't sincere -

1258
01:48:36,873 --> 01:48:40,539
- Could stage a fight like this
against all odds.

1259
01:48:40,711 --> 01:48:45,503
After twenty years work with you
you take his word against mine?!

1260
01:48:45,674 --> 01:48:49,542
That's what it means.
If he's just a bit right, then I'm wrong.

1261
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:53,303
Can't we work out some deal
to pull that Willet dam out -

1262
01:48:53,474 --> 01:48:55,550
And let the deficiency bill go through?

1263
01:48:55,726 --> 01:48:59,344
It isn't a question of Willet dam.
It's a question of my honour. -

1264
01:48:59,521 --> 01:49:04,148
- The integrity of the committee
and the integrity of the Senate!

1265
01:49:04,318 --> 01:49:07,769
If you want to throw out Section 40,
I'll resign.

1266
01:49:07,945 --> 01:49:11,695
Wait a minute. This is nonsense.
Joe is right.

1267
01:49:11,867 --> 01:49:16,778
A deal is impossible. We have to keep on
what we've been doing and break him.

1268
01:49:16,955 --> 01:49:21,001
Keep him talking, no relief.
Maintain a quorum in relays.

1269
01:49:21,169 --> 01:49:23,292
Is that how you feel, John?

1270
01:49:23,462 --> 01:49:26,084
Let's relieve the men on the floor.

1271
01:49:26,257 --> 01:49:29,543
- A man as green as that...
- He can't go on much longer.

1272
01:49:31,303 --> 01:49:33,427
"...with certain unalienable rights.

1273
01:49:33,598 --> 01:49:36,931
Among these are life, liberty
and the pursuit of..."

1274
01:49:39,395 --> 01:49:42,480
Looks like the night shift's coming on.

1275
01:49:44,901 --> 01:49:49,313
The Senator will please suspend
until order is restored in the chamber.

1276
01:49:56,204 --> 01:49:59,370
Half of official Washington
is here to see -

1277
01:49:59,540 --> 01:50:03,538
- Democracy's fine show: the filibuster.
The right to talk your head off.

1278
01:50:03,711 --> 01:50:07,162
Free speech in its most dramatic form.

1279
01:50:07,340 --> 01:50:11,752
The least man in that chamber,
once he gets and holds that floor. -

1280
01:50:11,928 --> 01:50:14,882
- Can talk as long
as he can stand on his feet.

1281
01:50:15,056 --> 01:50:17,761
Providing that he does not sit down. -

1282
01:50:17,934 --> 01:50:20,970
- Does not leave the chamber
or stop talking.

1283
01:50:21,145 --> 01:50:23,138
The galleries are packed.

1284
01:50:23,314 --> 01:50:26,849
In the diplomatic gallery
are the envoys of two dictator powers.

1285
01:50:27,026 --> 01:50:31,189
They have come to see what they can't
see at home: democracy in action.

1286
01:50:31,364 --> 01:50:33,903
"...the pursuit of happiness.

1287
01:50:34,076 --> 01:50:37,776
That, to secure these rights,
governments are instituted among men. -

1288
01:50:37,955 --> 01:50:40,872
- Deriving their just powers
from the consent of the governed; -

1289
01:50:41,041 --> 01:50:44,873
- That whenever any form of government
becomes destructive to these ends. -

1290
01:50:45,045 --> 01:50:48,710
- It is the right of the people
to alter or abolish..."

1291
01:50:48,882 --> 01:50:51,918
How am I doing?

1292
01:50:53,762 --> 01:50:55,839
Quit stalling and move!

1293
01:50:57,432 --> 01:50:59,508
- Mr Taylor.
- Wait a minute.

1294
01:50:59,684 --> 01:51:01,558
Tell Senator Paine.

1295
01:51:01,728 --> 01:51:04,266
About this Smith filibuster.

1296
01:51:04,439 --> 01:51:08,852
Your chain of newspapers must realise
that this bill he is trying to block -

1297
01:51:09,027 --> 01:51:10,985
Will affect your section.

1298
01:51:11,155 --> 01:51:14,772
It's the patriotic duty
of every newspaper in the country!

1299
01:51:14,950 --> 01:51:18,283
We've got to keep hammering at this man
until we smash him!

1300
01:51:18,454 --> 01:51:23,115
I always get a great kick out of that
part of the Declaration of Independence.

1301
01:51:23,291 --> 01:51:26,708
You're not gonna have a country that
can make these kinds of rules work. -

1302
01:51:26,879 --> 01:51:31,339
- If you haven't got men who can tell
human rights from a punch in the nose.

1303
01:51:36,513 --> 01:51:38,055
That's the headline.

1304
01:51:38,223 --> 01:51:42,720
It's a funny thing about men.
They all start life being boys...

1305
01:51:42,894 --> 01:51:46,974
I wouldn't be surprised if some of
these senators were boys once.

1306
01:51:47,148 --> 01:51:51,277
That's why it's a good idea to get boys
out of the crowded cities -

1307
01:51:51,445 --> 01:51:53,521
For a couple of months of the year.

1308
01:51:53,697 --> 01:51:57,114
Build their bodies and minds
for man-sized jobs.

1309
01:51:57,285 --> 01:52:02,279
They'll be behind these desks some day.
It seemed like a pretty good idea.

1310
01:52:02,456 --> 01:52:07,533
Boys from all over the country,
of all nationalities and ways of life.

1311
01:52:07,711 --> 01:52:12,374
Getting them together to find out
what makes different people tick.

1312
01:52:12,551 --> 01:52:15,835
I wouldn't give two cents
for all your fancy rules -

1313
01:52:16,011 --> 01:52:20,674
- If behind them they didn't have
plain, ordinary everyday kindness.

1314
01:52:20,850 --> 01:52:24,717
And... a little looking out for
the other fellow too.

1315
01:52:32,987 --> 01:52:36,653
That's pretty important,
all that.

1316
01:52:36,825 --> 01:52:39,778
It's the blood, bone and sinew
of this democracy -

1317
01:52:39,952 --> 01:52:42,907
- That great men handed down
to the human race!

1318
01:52:43,081 --> 01:52:46,579
But if you've got to build a dam
where that boys camp ought to be. -

1319
01:52:46,750 --> 01:52:50,915
- To get some graft
to pay off some political army...

1320
01:52:51,089 --> 01:52:54,872
If you think I'll go back
and tell those boys in my state:

1321
01:52:55,050 --> 01:52:59,215
"Forget it. All this stuff I've been
telling you about this land -

1322
01:52:59,389 --> 01:53:03,136
- Is a lot of hooey!
This country belongs to the Taylors."

1323
01:53:03,308 --> 01:53:08,103
Not me! Anybody who thinks I'll do that
has another think coming!

1324
01:53:18,032 --> 01:53:22,742
That's all right. I just wanted
to find out whether you still had faces.

1325
01:53:27,625 --> 01:53:29,619
I'm sorry, gentlemen...

1326
01:53:30,838 --> 01:53:35,297
I know I'm being disrespectful
to this honourable body...

1327
01:53:35,466 --> 01:53:39,760
A guy like me should never be allowed
to get in here in the first place!

1328
01:53:39,929 --> 01:53:43,512
I hate to stand here
and try your patience. -

1329
01:53:43,683 --> 01:53:47,218
- But either I'm dead right
or I'm crazy!

1330
01:53:47,395 --> 01:53:51,773
You wouldn't care to
put that to a vote, Senator?

1331
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:55,772
- Will the Senator yield for a question?
- I yield.

1332
01:53:55,945 --> 01:53:58,697
In view of the gentleman's concern
for the senators -

1333
01:53:58,865 --> 01:54:03,408
- And the fact that he's been talking
for 71/2 hours and must be tired. -

1334
01:54:03,578 --> 01:54:06,994
- Would he permit a motion
to recess until the morning. -

1335
01:54:07,165 --> 01:54:10,996
- At which time he may be better able
to continue his profound babbling?

1336
01:54:11,168 --> 01:54:12,912
No, don't.

1337
01:54:16,550 --> 01:54:19,384
Ask him.

1338
01:54:25,018 --> 01:54:27,971
Mr President,
what happens to me in the morning?

1339
01:54:28,145 --> 01:54:32,606
I mean, about my having this floor
to go on with my babbling.

1340
01:54:32,775 --> 01:54:35,561
If the Senator permits this motion. -

1341
01:54:35,736 --> 01:54:39,651
- He won't have the floor
to babble with or anything else.

1342
01:54:39,824 --> 01:54:44,319
Unless he's recognised first
by this chair.

1343
01:54:51,376 --> 01:54:56,335
As I was saying, gentlemen...
I'm either dead right or I'm crazy.

1344
01:54:56,507 --> 01:55:00,968
- I feel fine. What have you got?
- From Miss Saunders.

1345
01:55:27,704 --> 01:55:30,491
Is the Senator yielding the floor?

1346
01:55:31,709 --> 01:55:36,998
Yield the...? Oh, no.
I feel fine.

1347
01:55:39,885 --> 01:55:43,051
"The Constitution of the United States".

1348
01:55:49,186 --> 01:55:51,473
Page one, top left-hand corner:

1349
01:55:51,645 --> 01:55:55,858
"We, the people of the United States,
in order to form a more perfect union."

1350
01:55:56,026 --> 01:55:57,983
Yeah? Buy it or wreck it!

1351
01:55:59,820 --> 01:56:02,110
- Holy smoke!
- What's the matter?

1352
01:56:02,282 --> 01:56:06,280
This is murder. You've got to
call him off. He's getting nowhere.

1353
01:56:06,452 --> 01:56:10,201
Not one word of what he's saying
is being printed in that state!

1354
01:56:10,373 --> 01:56:14,868
Taylor has every paper lined up
and he's feeding them doctored-up junk!

1355
01:56:15,044 --> 01:56:18,330
- One man muzzling a whole state?
- And how!

1356
01:56:18,506 --> 01:56:20,878
Freedom of the press!

1357
01:56:22,634 --> 01:56:25,257
I've got an idea! Come on.

1358
01:56:25,972 --> 01:56:30,183
- Jeff has a paper there. Boy Stuff.
- Terrific!

1359
01:56:30,350 --> 01:56:33,934
They aren't letting what Jeff says
get printed in the state.

1360
01:56:34,105 --> 01:56:37,769
If I give you a raft of it now
over the phone. -

1361
01:56:37,941 --> 01:56:42,403
- Can you print it up
and spread a billion copies of it?

1362
01:56:42,572 --> 01:56:46,438
Swell!
Get ready to take it down, Mrs Smith.

1363
01:56:47,493 --> 01:56:51,076
Everything about Jeff.
Get pencils and paper, quick!

1364
01:56:51,247 --> 01:56:53,535
Here we go.

1365
01:56:53,707 --> 01:56:57,410
- All ready, Clarissa.
- She called me Clarissa!

1366
01:56:58,130 --> 01:57:00,834
Okay, Ma.

1367
01:57:01,007 --> 01:57:04,875
Jeff tells truth.
Shows up Taylor.

1368
01:57:05,054 --> 01:57:09,880
I want the whole morning edition
a blast to push him off the floor.

1369
01:57:10,058 --> 01:57:13,474
Willet dam is a fraud to line
the pockets of the Taylor machine.

1370
01:57:13,645 --> 01:57:15,721
Here's your front page editorial:

1371
01:57:15,898 --> 01:57:19,978
A convicted thief representing you
holds the floor of the U. S. Senate.

1372
01:57:20,152 --> 01:57:22,394
All right, boys, hurry up.

1373
01:57:33,164 --> 01:57:35,323
Come on, bring on the paper.

1374
01:58:13,831 --> 01:58:16,868
...charity waters not itself. -

1375
01:58:17,043 --> 01:58:20,328
Is not puffed up -

1376
01:58:21,798 --> 01:58:27,551
- And now abideth
faith, hope, charity.

1377
01:58:28,471 --> 01:58:30,380
These three.

1378
01:58:32,225 --> 01:58:35,594
The greatest of these is charity.

1379
01:59:12,765 --> 01:59:15,090
Read about Jeff Smith!

1380
01:59:18,562 --> 01:59:24,268
- Distributed by nine millions kids!
- Get the boys out. Do it!

1381
01:59:35,914 --> 01:59:38,120
Look out, fellows.

1382
01:59:38,291 --> 01:59:41,328
Come on, get these papers out of here.

1383
01:59:46,383 --> 01:59:49,253
Read all about it!
Jeff Smith lies in Senate!

1384
02:00:09,989 --> 02:00:15,529
Are we going to let a man like that
throw mud at a man like Joe Paine?

1385
02:00:15,703 --> 02:00:18,539
Are you for Joe Paine?

1386
02:00:19,749 --> 02:00:22,454
Hurrah for Jeff Smith!

1387
02:00:37,976 --> 02:00:41,179
Children hurt all over the city!
Tell Jeff to stop!

1388
02:00:41,354 --> 02:00:45,305
Yes, all right.
Yes, goodbye.

1389
02:00:47,945 --> 02:00:51,444
Senator Smith has now talked
for 23 hours and 16 minutes.

1390
02:00:51,615 --> 02:00:54,367
It is the most spectacular thing
in the Senate annals.

1391
02:00:54,535 --> 02:00:57,654
One simple American
holding the greatest floor.

1392
02:00:57,830 --> 02:01:00,867
What he lacked in experience,
he's made up in fight.

1393
02:01:01,041 --> 02:01:03,793
But those tired
boy ranger legs are buckling. -

1394
02:01:03,961 --> 02:01:07,412
- Bleary eyes, voice gone,
he can't go on much longer.

1395
02:01:07,590 --> 02:01:10,626
All Washington is here
to be in on the kill.

1396
02:01:11,885 --> 02:01:17,128
There's no compromise with the truth.
That's all I got the floor to say.

1397
02:01:18,016 --> 02:01:21,516
When was it?
A year ago, it seems like...

1398
02:01:21,687 --> 02:01:26,230
- Diz, terrible things are happening.
- They're listening to him now.

1399
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:29,566
Just get up off the ground.

1400
02:01:29,736 --> 02:01:33,401
Get up there with that lady
on top of the Capitol dome. -

1401
02:01:33,574 --> 02:01:35,696
That lady that stands for liberty.

1402
02:01:35,867 --> 02:01:39,652
Take a look at this country
through her eyes.

1403
02:01:40,706 --> 02:01:42,947
You won'tjust see scenery.

1404
02:01:43,125 --> 02:01:45,996
You'll see
what man's carved out for himself -

1405
02:01:46,170 --> 02:01:51,377
- After centuries of fighting
for something better than jungle law.

1406
02:01:51,550 --> 02:01:55,761
Fighting so he can stand
on his own two feet, free and decent.

1407
02:01:55,929 --> 02:02:00,638
Like he was created. No matter
what his race, colour or creed.

1408
02:02:02,521 --> 02:02:04,809
That's what you'll see.

1409
02:02:04,981 --> 02:02:09,394
There's no place out there
for graft or greed or lies. -

1410
02:02:09,570 --> 02:02:12,356
Or compromise with human liberties.

1411
02:02:12,530 --> 02:02:15,815
If that's what the grown-ups
have done with this world. -

1412
02:02:15,992 --> 02:02:20,701
- We have to start those boys' camps
and see what the kids can do.

1413
02:02:20,872 --> 02:02:23,244
It's not too late.

1414
02:02:23,416 --> 02:02:28,790
This country is bigger than the Taylors,
you or me or anything else.

1415
02:02:30,590 --> 02:02:33,924
Great principles don't get lost
once they come to light.

1416
02:02:34,093 --> 02:02:38,221
They're right here.
You just have to see them.

1417
02:02:41,726 --> 02:02:45,510
Mr President...
will the Senator yield for a question?

1418
02:02:45,688 --> 02:02:49,982
- Will Senator Smith yield?
- Yes, I yield for a question.

1419
02:02:50,151 --> 02:02:53,899
The Senator says he is speaking
to the people of his state.

1420
02:02:54,071 --> 02:02:58,982
He has been waiting for them
to come marching here in droves.

1421
02:02:59,160 --> 02:03:02,909
Is the gentleman interested
in knowing what those people say?

1422
02:03:03,081 --> 02:03:07,742
- Here it comes, Diz.
- Yes, sir. You bet I am.

1423
02:03:07,918 --> 02:03:13,257
Have I permission to bring
evidence of the response from my state?

1424
02:03:13,424 --> 02:03:17,553
Is there objection?...
You may proceed, Senator.

1425
02:03:17,721 --> 02:03:20,638
Come on, pageboys. All of you.

1426
02:03:54,674 --> 02:03:58,174
I can't stand to see him hurt.

1427
02:03:58,345 --> 02:04:01,595
- Public opinion made to order.
- Taylor-made.

1428
02:04:02,223 --> 02:04:05,593
There it is. The gentleman's answer.

1429
02:04:05,769 --> 02:04:10,181
50,000 telegrams demanding
that he yield this floor.

1430
02:04:10,356 --> 02:04:13,976
I invite the Senate to read them.
I invite my colleague to read them.

1431
02:04:14,153 --> 02:04:17,568
The people's answer
to Mr Jefferson Smith.

1432
02:05:00,575 --> 02:05:02,697
Stop, Jeff, stop!

1433
02:05:47,538 --> 02:05:51,239
I guess this is just another lost cause,
Mr Paine.

1434
02:05:56,255 --> 02:05:59,590
All you people
don't know about lost causes.

1435
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:01,918
Mr Paine does.

1436
02:06:02,971 --> 02:06:07,467
He said once they were
the only causes worth fighting for.

1437
02:06:07,643 --> 02:06:12,766
And he fought for them for the only
reason any man ever fights for them.

1438
02:06:17,444 --> 02:06:22,687
Because ofjust one plain, simple rule:
Love thy neighbour.

1439
02:06:24,534 --> 02:06:30,075
In this world full of hatred a man who
knows that one rule has a great trust.

1440
02:06:30,248 --> 02:06:36,250
You know that rule, Mr Paine. I loved
you for it, just as my father did.

1441
02:06:36,420 --> 02:06:40,253
You know that
you fight harder for the lost causes.

1442
02:06:40,425 --> 02:06:43,295
You even die for them.

1443
02:06:45,013 --> 02:06:48,464
Like a man we both knew, Mr Paine.

1444
02:06:50,726 --> 02:06:56,765
You think I'm licked.
You all think I'm licked.

1445
02:06:58,025 --> 02:07:03,233
Well, I am not licked!
I'll stay and fight for this lost cause.

1446
02:07:03,406 --> 02:07:06,857
Even if this room
gets filled with lies like these -

1447
02:07:07,034 --> 02:07:12,161
- And the Taylors and all their armies
come marching into this place.

1448
02:07:13,333 --> 02:07:16,121
Somebody will listen to me.

1449
02:07:39,193 --> 02:07:41,351
He's okay. He just fainted.

1450
02:07:54,667 --> 02:07:57,870
I'm not fit to be a senator!
I'm not fit to live!

1451
02:07:58,045 --> 02:08:01,496
Expel me! Expel me, not him!
Willet dam is a fraud.

1452
02:08:01,674 --> 02:08:05,256
It's a crime against the people
who sent me here! I committed it!

1453
02:08:05,427 --> 02:08:09,211
Every word that boy said
about Taylor and me and graft -

1454
02:08:09,390 --> 02:08:13,090
- And the rotten political corruption
