1
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:45,699
Nice fat deposit.
You're sure in the right business, Sally

2
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:46,979
Thank you

3
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:49,529
Well, good morning

4
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:51,989
Deposit

5
00:06:01,538 --> 00:06:02,628
Another nice deposit

6
00:06:02,698 --> 00:06:04,788
You and Sally are sure
in the right business.

7
00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:06,458
I'm in a hurry, please

8
00:06:56,126 --> 00:06:57,336
Hi, Kate

9
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:38,514
Have you cleaned up the house
across the way?

10
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,004
I haven't had time yet

11
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,254
You should always do that one first

12
00:07:50,184 --> 00:07:51,354
Anne!

13
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,854
Come here

14
00:08:03,193 --> 00:08:05,743
Did you ever see that kid out there before?

15
00:08:06,113 --> 00:08:08,333
I think maybe he was in the bar last night

16
00:08:08,403 --> 00:08:09,613
Send Joe in

17
00:08:10,783 --> 00:08:11,793
Joe

18
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,223
Hello, Pretty Boy

19
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:27,762
-Call me, Kate?
Yeah. Take a look out the window

20
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:31,682
There's a kid Who's been following me
all the way to the bank and back.

21
00:08:57,081 --> 00:08:59,581
Come here, you young squirt, come here

22
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:05,131
-You want me?
What's the idea of throwing that stone?

23
00:09:06,341 --> 00:09:08,391
Any law against throwing stones?

24
00:09:09,051 --> 00:09:11,181
You're tough? Come here!

25
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:17,600
What are you hanging around here for
anyway?

26
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,480
Would she talk to me?
-Kate?

27
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,910
What for? What do you want?

28
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,910
Just wanna talk to her

29
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,320
What do you want, you?
-Nothing.

30
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,830
You live around here?

31
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,830
In Monterey?
-Salinas.

32
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,249
What's your name?

33
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:46,139
You're not talking? Now, look

34
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:48,339
why are you following Kate around?

35
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,209
What's the idea, squirt?

36
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:53,259
Any law against following
around the town...

37
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:56,269
madam, whatever you call her?

38
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:59,609
I don't know if there's any law against it
but she don't like it.

39
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:01,899
She owns that house over there, too
don't she?

40
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:05,359
But don't you go hanging
around there, squirt. You're too young

41
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,768
Now come on. Now beat it

42
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,608
Is that her real name?

43
00:10:11,148 --> 00:10:15,578
-Kate. Is that her real name?
Sure, as far as I know. Why?

44
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:18,668
What's her last name?

45
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:21,548
Nobody's got any last name
around here, kid. Why?

46
00:10:25,788 --> 00:10:28,838
You tell her I hate her

47
00:10:52,727 --> 00:10:55,367
I should have gone right on in there

48
00:10:56,237 --> 00:10:58,736
Should have gone right on in there
and talked to her.

49
00:11:21,926 --> 00:11:24,885
Cal wasn't home all night.
Boy, is he gonna catch it from Dad

50
00:11:24,965 --> 00:11:27,605
You know what the girls in class call him?
-No, what?

51
00:11:27,675 --> 00:11:29,315
The Prowler

52
00:11:29,385 --> 00:11:31,395
-I'll tell him that.
You better not, Aron

53
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:32,865
Promise me you won't
-Why not?

54
00:11:32,935 --> 00:11:35,235
Please don't. I don't want you

55
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:38,285
Hi, Cal
-Hi.

56
00:11:38,355 --> 00:11:39,915
Hello, Cal

57
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:42,075
Excuse me for talking

58
00:11:42,155 --> 00:11:44,955
We're going down to see the icehouse
that Dad's gonna buy.

59
00:11:45,035 --> 00:11:46,665
Do you want to come?
-What icehouse?

60
00:11:46,745 --> 00:11:49,044
The one he's buying
to freeze the vegetables with

61
00:11:49,114 --> 00:11:51,884
He's been talking about it every night
for the last week.

62
00:11:51,954 --> 00:11:53,214
Is Dad gonna be there?

63
00:11:53,284 --> 00:11:55,344
Why sure, he's gonna buy it

64
00:11:57,294 --> 00:11:58,794
I'll skip it

65
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:01,794
You're gonna have
to see him sometime, Cal

66
00:12:01,884 --> 00:12:04,724
-Come on.
Hey, Aron

67
00:12:04,804 --> 00:12:05,764
Yeah?

68
00:12:06,424 --> 00:12:09,894
Why don't you ask me where I've been?
-Would you tell me?

69
00:12:10,804 --> 00:12:13,353
-No.
Then what's the use of my asking?

70
00:12:16,223 --> 00:12:18,563
-Is Dad mad at me?
Well, you were out all night

71
00:12:18,643 --> 00:12:20,813
He was worried

72
00:12:21,813 --> 00:12:23,073
Yeah, I bet

73
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:26,903
You gonna come or not?

74
00:12:29,493 --> 00:12:32,043
Okay. I'll see you at supper

75
00:12:32,363 --> 00:12:33,543
He's coming

76
00:12:34,913 --> 00:12:36,333
He's coming

77
00:12:43,332 --> 00:12:45,882
You see, Will, I got the idea
from an article I read.

78
00:12:45,962 --> 00:12:48,642
They dug up a mastodon
somewhere in Siberia.

79
00:12:48,712 --> 00:12:52,232
Been in the ice for thousands of years
and the meat was still good.

80
00:12:52,302 --> 00:12:53,262
Mastodon?

81
00:12:58,392 --> 00:13:00,812
What have you got to say for yourself?

82
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:06,071
This is my son, Cal

83
00:13:07,111 --> 00:13:10,121
When you were his age,
I imagine you thought it only right

84
00:13:10,191 --> 00:13:12,831
to let your father know
before you stayed out all night

85
00:13:12,901 --> 00:13:16,581
Or at least to offer some kind
of apology when you did come home

86
00:13:16,831 --> 00:13:18,551
Well, times change

87
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:23,171
As I was saying,
a mastodon is a kind of elephant

88
00:13:23,251 --> 00:13:25,421
Hasn't lived on the Earth for a long while

89
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:28,680
And the meat was still fresh?
-Sweet as a pork chop.

90
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,180
You're more excited about this
than you've been for a long time

91
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,010
Now, I seem to be, don't I?

92
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:37,190
See, Will, I've been sort of
in a rut out there in the ranch

93
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:41,020
Sixteen, 17 years, I've kept out of things
-I know.

94
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,480
But now I feel that
if I could only do something

95
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,370
some little thing for, before I die
some little thing for progress...

96
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,200
for people, maybe.
Call it anything you want

97
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,579
I might make up for all the years
I've been lying fallow.

98
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:59,619
So, lately I've been reading up all I can
about refrigeration.

99
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:03,299
And I can't get it out of my head
that you can keep anything good.

100
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:07,049
As long as you can get it cold enough
Like that mastodon there.

101
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:09,459
-Good afternoon, Abra.
Good afternoon, Mr. Trask

102
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:10,839
Hello, Mr. Hamilton
-Hello.

103
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,099
Hello, Son
-Hi, Dad.

104
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:16,349
Now my son, Aron, that is,
thinks I may have a good idea here

105
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:18,509
Dad wrapped a head of lettuce
in wax paper...

106
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:20,848
and kept it in our icebox
for over three Weeks...

107
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:22,938
and it still came out fresh and good
Right?

108
00:14:23,018 --> 00:14:24,108
Quite right, Son

109
00:14:24,178 --> 00:14:28,438
Dad, is it all right if we look around?
-'Course, Aron. Belongs to us now.

110
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:33,448
Do you know where the biggest market
for vegetables is in the winter?

111
00:14:33,528 --> 00:14:35,278
-Where?
New York City

112
00:14:35,358 --> 00:14:37,248
And they can't raise them there

113
00:14:37,318 --> 00:14:40,118
But the railroad had promised me
those fruit cars.

114
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:44,417
Don't you have anything to say to me, Cal?

115
00:14:44,497 --> 00:14:46,717
-Yeah.
it's about time. Well?

116
00:14:48,077 --> 00:14:51,427
I read in the Monterey newspaper

117
00:14:51,497 --> 00:14:54,467
that if we get into this war

118
00:14:54,547 --> 00:14:57,267
there are gonna be some fortunes made

119
00:14:57,507 --> 00:15:01,977
But you're gonna make them
in beans and corn, and stuff like that

120
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:05,947
You don't need all this ice
-You're perfectly right.

121
00:15:06,017 --> 00:15:07,607
Beans are up to 3 cents

122
00:15:07,687 --> 00:15:09,656
You wanna make a profit, you plant beans

123
00:15:09,726 --> 00:15:11,736
And they keep, too, don't they?

124
00:15:11,816 --> 00:15:15,106
But I'm not particularly interested
in making a profit, Cal.

125
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:22,626
Look here, Will

126
00:15:22,696 --> 00:15:25,666
I'm not an inventor nor a scientist

127
00:15:25,746 --> 00:15:27,916
but I know I have an idea here

128
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:31,676
I come from a whole family of inventors
People full of ideas like this one.

129
00:15:31,746 --> 00:15:33,836
I'm the only one that didn't have an idea

130
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,675
and the only one that ever made a dime

131
00:15:35,755 --> 00:15:37,925
You wanna make a profit, you plant beans

132
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:41,015
Put out that cigarette!
That place is full of sawdust!

133
00:15:44,215 --> 00:15:48,895
Come on, Adam, he's just thoughtless
-Thoughtless? He's inconsiderate.

134
00:15:48,975 --> 00:15:51,555
I don't know.
I'm at my rope's end with that boy

135
00:15:51,645 --> 00:15:53,525
I don't understand him. I never have

136
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:56,365
Aron I've understood since he was a child

137
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:01,654
Help me up

138
00:16:05,614 --> 00:16:08,114
He doesn't like anybody, does he?
-Who, Dad?

139
00:16:08,204 --> 00:16:09,834
No, Cal

140
00:16:10,864 --> 00:16:12,584
it's dark in here and spooky

141
00:16:13,744 --> 00:16:15,504
Why is he so alone all the time?

142
00:16:15,584 --> 00:16:18,764
-He wants to be.
Nobody wants to be alone all the time

143
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:21,934
Dad's made a wonderful buy, hasn't he?
We'll freeze vegetables.

144
00:16:22,004 --> 00:16:24,254
It'll really give him something
to live for now.

145
00:16:24,344 --> 00:16:27,353
What's the matter, Abra
don't you like Cal?

146
00:16:27,423 --> 00:16:29,843
I guess I don't know him very well
-I love him.

147
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:33,393
Well, naturally, he's your brother
He's scary.

148
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:36,153
-Scary?
When he looks at you

149
00:16:36,643 --> 00:16:38,613
Sort of like an animal

150
00:16:38,683 --> 00:16:40,493
I don't know, he scares me

151
00:16:41,143 --> 00:16:43,913
Aron, when are we gonna get married?

152
00:16:44,813 --> 00:16:47,863
Just as soon as I get through
with that darned school.

153
00:16:48,693 --> 00:16:50,412
I wish it was right now

154
00:16:52,492 --> 00:16:54,162
-So do I.
Do you?

155
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:04,962
Abra

156
00:17:05,042 --> 00:17:06,512
-When we get--
I love you, Aron

157
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:09,172
When we get married,
it's going to be perfect

158
00:17:09,552 --> 00:17:12,102
Everything about it is going to be perfect

159
00:17:37,701 --> 00:17:40,330
You're gonna make
a wonderful mother, Abra

160
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,260
I hope so
-You are.

161
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,720
A perfect one

162
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,260
You don't remember your mother at all
do you, Aron?

163
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,380
No, she died
right after Cal and I were born

164
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,860
Must be hard never to have had a mother

165
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,610
-What's that?
Look, what's he doing up there?

166
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,440
-Crazy guy.
He's watching us

167
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,609
-No, he isn't.
Yes, he is, too

168
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:09,489
Let's move over here. Aron

169
00:18:20,949 --> 00:18:24,419
-He's not watching us.
I feel as if he can still see us

170
00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:32,798
I love you, Aron

171
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,638
Really, I do. Really

172
00:18:36,008 --> 00:18:38,228
Sure. I love you, too

173
00:18:57,357 --> 00:18:59,997
Cal, stop! Stop that, Cal!

174
00:19:00,077 --> 00:19:01,957
What are you doing? Stop it!

175
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:07,837
"Blessed is he
whose transgression is forgiven

176
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:09,507
whose sin is covered

177
00:19:10,497 --> 00:19:14,347
"Blessed is the man unto whom
the Lord imputeth not iniquity...

178
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:18,387
and in whose spirit there is no guile

179
00:19:20,217 --> 00:19:22,356
And you are forgiven, Cal

180
00:19:23,716 --> 00:19:27,316
I think there is no iniquity
in your actions...

181
00:19:27,436 --> 00:19:29,686
only something I do not know

182
00:19:31,606 --> 00:19:34,286
Why did you push that ice down?

183
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:39,326
I don't know

184
00:19:40,566 --> 00:19:41,696
Was it

185
00:19:42,576 --> 00:19:45,706
Was it vengeance? Anger?

186
00:19:46,535 --> 00:19:50,245
Fear that I would punish you
for not coming home last night?

187
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:52,125
What was it?

188
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,845
I wanted to see it slide down the chute

189
00:19:58,465 --> 00:20:01,805
Perhaps you had better read from here on
-I'll read it, Dad.

190
00:20:01,965 --> 00:20:04,215
No, it's for Cal to read

191
00:20:04,305 --> 00:20:06,475
Start at the fifth verse

192
00:20:07,885 --> 00:20:09,225
Verse 5

193
00:20:27,114 --> 00:20:30,374
"I acknowledge my sin unto thee
and mine iniquity have I not hid.

194
00:20:30,454 --> 00:20:33,214
I said, I will confess my transgressions
unto the Lord...

195
00:20:33,284 --> 00:20:35,834
"and thou forgavest
the iniquity of my sin. Selah

196
00:20:35,914 --> 00:20:36,923
Go on

197
00:20:42,463 --> 00:20:43,633
Six

198
00:20:43,713 --> 00:20:45,933
And I suggest a little slower, Cal

199
00:20:46,003 --> 00:20:48,553
And you don't have to read
the verse numbers.

200
00:20:48,923 --> 00:20:52,933
For this shall every one that is godly
pray unto thee.

201
00:20:53,013 --> 00:20:55,103
And surely in the floods of great waters

202
00:20:55,183 --> 00:20:58,443
they shall not come nigh unto him
Selah."

203
00:20:58,523 --> 00:20:59,533
Seven

204
00:20:59,603 --> 00:21:01,113
Not the numbers, Cal

205
00:21:01,313 --> 00:21:05,242
"Thou art my hiding place,
thou shalt preserve me from trouble

206
00:21:05,322 --> 00:21:09,202
"thou shalt compass me about
with songs of deliverance. Selah

207
00:21:10,822 --> 00:21:13,952
-Eight.
You have no repentance! You're bad!

208
00:21:14,122 --> 00:21:15,592
Through and through, bad

209
00:21:15,662 --> 00:21:18,512
Excuse me. I'll go out and wait for Abra

210
00:21:27,631 --> 00:21:31,011
You're right. I am bad.
I knew that for along time

211
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:34,061
I didn't mean that, Cal. I spoke in anger

212
00:21:34,141 --> 00:21:36,311
Well, it's true

213
00:21:37,431 --> 00:21:39,191
Aron's the good one

214
00:21:39,471 --> 00:21:41,361
I guess there's just a certain amount

215
00:21:41,431 --> 00:21:43,441
of good and bad you get
from your parents...

216
00:21:43,521 --> 00:21:45,941
and I just got the bad
-That's not true.

217
00:21:46,021 --> 00:21:47,491
Cal, listen to me

218
00:21:48,021 --> 00:21:50,201
You can make of yourself
anything you want.

219
00:21:50,281 --> 00:21:52,610
It's up to you. A man has a choice

220
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,280
That's where he's different from an animal

221
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,340
You don't listen. You'll never remember

222
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,340
My mother

223
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,010
she's not dead and gone to heaven

224
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,099
is she?

225
00:22:19,139 --> 00:22:20,649
Why do you ask that?

226
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:23,019
She's not dead at all

227
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:26,979
She's not buried in the East
like you said, either.

228
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:28,819
She's alive

229
00:22:28,899 --> 00:22:31,239
What makes you think so?
-I heard from a guy.

230
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:32,869
-Who?
I don't know his name

231
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:35,159
He was just passing through

232
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:39,209
How come you told Aron and me she died?

233
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:41,869
I thought it would save you pain
-Pain?

234
00:22:48,748 --> 00:22:51,388
If she was still alive,
where do you think she'd be?

235
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:54,508
I have no idea. She went East

236
00:22:54,718 --> 00:22:56,098
How do you know?

237
00:22:56,628 --> 00:23:00,888
When she left the ranch we lived on
when you and Aron were born...

238
00:23:01,808 --> 00:23:03,398
I heard she went East

239
00:23:04,518 --> 00:23:06,518
What was she like? Was she bad?

240
00:23:07,307 --> 00:23:09,447
I guess she

241
00:23:10,357 --> 00:23:13,947
I never really knew what she was like
She wasn't like other people.

242
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:16,407
There was something she seemed to lack

243
00:23:17,947 --> 00:23:20,277
Kindness, maybe. Conscience

244
00:23:22,407 --> 00:23:24,497
I never knew what she was after

245
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:27,757
-How come she left you?
I never knew that, either

246
00:23:27,827 --> 00:23:31,677
She was so full of hate

247
00:23:31,747 --> 00:23:34,426
-Hate for you?
For everything

248
00:23:38,546 --> 00:23:41,266
You won't tell Aron that she didn't die?

249
00:23:42,006 --> 00:23:43,016
No

250
00:23:43,766 --> 00:23:46,186
Must not do anything to hurt Aron

251
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:53,356
Where'd you get that scar
you got on your shoulder, Father?

252
00:23:53,436 --> 00:23:55,196
I've told you, Cal

253
00:23:55,646 --> 00:23:59,245
it's an old wound I got
in the Indian campaigns

254
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:03,415
-Why do you ask that now?
What'd she look like? Was she pretty?

255
00:24:04,825 --> 00:24:08,125
She had the most lovely hands

256
00:24:08,205 --> 00:24:09,625
Like ivory

257
00:24:10,785 --> 00:24:12,925
She took such good care of them

258
00:24:14,205 --> 00:24:15,675
Her mother had arthritis

259
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:19,015
She was always afraid
it would come to her in her hands

260
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:26,974
Talk to me, Father

261
00:24:31,684 --> 00:24:34,644
I got to know who I am.
I got to know who I'm like

262
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:36,064
I got to know

263
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:38,904
Where is she?

264
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:42,324
I'm telling you, truthfully, Cal

265
00:24:43,154 --> 00:24:45,454
after she left, I never heard from her

266
00:24:48,493 --> 00:24:50,493
Cal, wait. I want to talk more with you

267
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:53,923
If you leave this room now
we may never be able to talk again

268
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:56,173
You coming home tonight, Cal?

269
00:24:56,243 --> 00:24:59,383
What's the difference?
You're home. You're the one he wants

270
00:24:59,463 --> 00:25:02,043
Good evening, Cal

271
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:05,553
High strung. Very high strung

272
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:08,853
Good evening, Abra.
Where is my chess victim?

273
00:25:09,053 --> 00:25:11,223
He's waiting for you, Mr. Albrecht
-Good.

274
00:25:11,303 --> 00:25:13,602
What do you suppose he meant by that?

275
00:25:27,612 --> 00:25:29,582
Go on, beat it!

276
00:25:31,702 --> 00:25:33,622
Your wife has called up three times

277
00:25:33,702 --> 00:25:37,662
-My wife's a--
I know she is. Now beat it

278
00:25:47,301 --> 00:25:48,971
Joe!

279
00:25:53,721 --> 00:25:56,521
All right, fella, you've run out of money

280
00:25:56,601 --> 00:25:58,481
Mr. Hawks

281
00:26:02,731 --> 00:26:04,950
What do you want?
-I want--

282
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,570
What do you want to drink?
-Beer.

283
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,510
Hey!

284
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,960
Where's my drink?
-All right.

285
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,550
That's not very neat, is

286
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,469
it's okay

287
00:26:32,089 --> 00:26:33,979
You'd better get out of here
-How come?

288
00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:36,269
You're the one who followed Kate
this morning.

289
00:26:36,339 --> 00:26:38,849
It's a free country, isn't it?
-it's a free country.

290
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:41,939
Only, Joe said if I saw you again
I was supposed to tell him.

291
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:44,069
You can tell him if you want to

292
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:47,779
You're just a kid, ain't you?

293
00:26:48,939 --> 00:26:51,529
-I'm older than you are.
Yeah, sure, but that isn't

294
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:53,199
-Hey!
All right

295
00:26:54,858 --> 00:26:55,948
Kid, please

296
00:26:56,028 --> 00:26:58,578
you oughtn't to go around
throwing stones and things

297
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:01,238
That isn't nice. And drinking beer

298
00:27:03,448 --> 00:27:04,628
There's Joe

299
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:08,968
Look, kid, please go.
You don't want to get yourself hurt

300
00:27:09,788 --> 00:27:13,088
You could tell him now, if you want to
There's your chance.

301
00:27:14,418 --> 00:27:17,058
You sure have got a nerve, haven't you?

302
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:27,607
-Do you know Kate?
This is Kate's place.

303
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:30,817
She's treating you okay?
-Sure.

304
00:27:30,897 --> 00:27:32,647
I gotta go now, kid

305
00:27:32,727 --> 00:27:34,117
Is she nice?

306
00:27:34,607 --> 00:27:35,997
Don't let Joe see you, please

307
00:27:36,067 --> 00:27:38,407
She doesn't treat you rough
or anything, does she?

308
00:27:38,487 --> 00:27:41,417
Please, kid, I gotta go now
It was nice meeting you.

309
00:27:41,487 --> 00:27:44,126
Isn't there anything nice about her at all?

310
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,836
What's the matter, kid?

311
00:27:47,786 --> 00:27:50,336
She had pretty hands. Did you see them?
-Hands?

312
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:51,546
Did you look at them?

313
00:27:51,626 --> 00:27:54,886
No, I don't think I ever saw them
She always wears gloves.

314
00:27:59,426 --> 00:28:00,546
Where is she?

315
00:28:00,636 --> 00:28:02,516
You mean now?
-Yeah.

316
00:28:02,596 --> 00:28:05,556
Back in her office, probably
-Where's that?

317
00:28:05,636 --> 00:28:07,356
Back that way

318
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,776
Will you show me?

319
00:28:12,435 --> 00:28:15,235
Look, kid, please don't start any trouble

320
00:28:15,315 --> 00:28:17,945
I'm not gonna start any trouble. Come on

321
00:28:18,025 --> 00:28:20,955
We .... You can just point the door to me
and I'll go there.

322
00:28:21,025 --> 00:28:22,205
No, honest

323
00:28:22,275 --> 00:28:25,245
This is a tough place. I can't lose this job

324
00:28:25,325 --> 00:28:27,795
I'm not very good at it, anyway
-You won't lose it.

325
00:28:27,865 --> 00:28:31,125
If I step out of line
Kate will throw me out on my ear

326
00:28:32,035 --> 00:28:34,455
Come on, will you?

327
00:28:34,544 --> 00:28:36,874
You can just show me where the door is

328
00:28:37,334 --> 00:28:38,544
Come on

329
00:28:40,254 --> 00:28:41,894
Be a sport

330
00:28:45,134 --> 00:28:46,524
Come on

331
00:29:00,943 --> 00:29:02,613
There's the door

332
00:29:03,023 --> 00:29:05,033
Thank you. You can go back now

333
00:29:05,903 --> 00:29:07,623
What are you gonna do?

334
00:29:08,193 --> 00:29:10,743
Please, kid, don't make any trouble

335
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:16,923
I'm not gonna make any trouble.
I'm gonna wait till you're gone. Okay?

336
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:13,011
Will you let me talk to you? Please

337
00:30:14,841 --> 00:30:17,180
I gotta talk to you

338
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:24,280
Joe!

339
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,660
Get out of here! Joe! Tex!

340
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,990
Call the sheriff! Get him out!

341
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:38,170
Call the sheriff! Get him out of here!

342
00:30:40,749 --> 00:30:43,049
I want to talk to her!

343
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,259
I want to talk to you!

344
00:30:55,929 --> 00:30:58,349
Please, talk to me!

345
00:30:58,429 --> 00:31:02,019
Talk to me, please! Mother!

346
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:07,018
Is there any law against a guy
trying to see his own mother?

347
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:09,358
No, I guess there isn't

348
00:31:10,228 --> 00:31:11,358
Here

349
00:31:11,438 --> 00:31:14,538
Put this on your cheek. Here

350
00:31:20,158 --> 00:31:21,578
Drink some coffee

351
00:31:23,198 --> 00:31:25,288
How did you find out about Kate, anyway?

352
00:31:25,368 --> 00:31:28,298
That guy I saw you talking to
in the bar the other night?

353
00:31:28,378 --> 00:31:31,007
The one they call "Rabbit

354
00:31:31,547 --> 00:31:34,837
I thought so. He never was any good

355
00:31:34,917 --> 00:31:37,967
I remember when he used
to work on your father's ranch

356
00:31:38,967 --> 00:31:43,057
Well, he won't be around anymore, Cal
He's left town for good.

357
00:31:45,977 --> 00:31:48,987
What do you hang around bars for?
-Any law against hanging--

358
00:31:49,057 --> 00:31:51,397
Yes, there is! I'm the law

359
00:31:51,727 --> 00:31:53,537
Get that through your head

360
00:31:54,937 --> 00:31:56,446
Shut up!

361
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:05,876
Does Adam know that you

362
00:32:05,956 --> 00:32:08,036
roam around over here at night?

363
00:32:12,286 --> 00:32:15,466
Adam's an old friend of mine
you know, Cal, from...

364
00:32:15,546 --> 00:32:17,876
Way back in his ranch days

365
00:32:18,716 --> 00:32:22,175
I was afraid when you moved here
last year...

366
00:32:22,755 --> 00:32:25,775
that you might find out something
about Kate.

367
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:29,695
But then she was over here on the Bay

368
00:32:29,765 --> 00:32:33,115
and you were way over on the other side
of the mountains in Salinas.

369
00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:37,195
-So I figured it'd be all right.
You think he'll ever find out about her?

370
00:32:37,605 --> 00:32:39,905
He'd never come over here

371
00:32:45,035 --> 00:32:47,004
Here. You might as well look at this now

372
00:32:47,074 --> 00:32:50,914
it's a picture of your father
and your mother on their wedding day

373
00:32:51,704 --> 00:32:54,424
You're the first person
I've ever showed it to.

374
00:32:59,624 --> 00:33:01,214
I knew it

375
00:33:03,254 --> 00:33:05,144
I knew it was true

376
00:33:07,424 --> 00:33:10,144
When that old guy told me in the bar
I knew it.

377
00:33:13,143 --> 00:33:15,223
How did you know it was true?

378
00:33:15,313 --> 00:33:18,573
Cause she ain't no good
and I ain't no good.

379
00:33:18,643 --> 00:33:21,323
I knew there was a reason why I wasn't

380
00:33:29,323 --> 00:33:30,493
I hate her

381
00:33:30,863 --> 00:33:33,083
And I hate him, too

382
00:33:34,373 --> 00:33:36,502
Come on, I'll take you home

383
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:41,712
-You don't have to drive me home!
I know I don't have to take you home!

384
00:33:42,962 --> 00:33:44,092
Here

385
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:47,682
A little bit of the hair
of the dog that bit you

386
00:33:48,262 --> 00:33:49,432
Come on now

387
00:34:03,021 --> 00:34:04,861
How did Dad meet her?

388
00:34:06,191 --> 00:34:07,911
Where did she come from?

389
00:34:08,821 --> 00:34:11,371
Nobody ever knew
where she come from, really

390
00:34:12,361 --> 00:34:15,541
There were a lot of drifters in those days

391
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:18,171
Of all the people

392
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:23,711
How come he married her?

393
00:34:24,211 --> 00:34:26,930
You have no idea how pretty she was, Cal

394
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,300
Young and full of spirit

395
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:32,100
And your father hadn't been
off the ranch much, you know

396
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,180
He's not a worldly man

397
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:47,610
Did she shoot him?
-Yes, she did.

398
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,790
How com e?

399
00:34:52,279 --> 00:34:53,619
I don't know

400
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,249
Did he do something to her?

401
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:00,829
Did he hurt her?
-No.

402
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,089
It wasn't in him to hurt her

403
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:07,919
After she left him, he died.
He walked around, but he died

404
00:35:11,419 --> 00:35:14,059
He must have done something to hurt her

405
00:35:14,469 --> 00:35:16,519
No. No, sir

406
00:35:16,589 --> 00:35:19,938
He gave her everything
that any woman could ask for

407
00:35:23,178 --> 00:35:25,648
You see, your father has more kindness

408
00:35:26,268 --> 00:35:30,408
and more conscience
than any man that I've ever known

409
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:44,907
He's a good man, Cal.
Don't sell him short, boy

410
00:36:11,016 --> 00:36:12,986
it's going to work

411
00:36:13,066 --> 00:36:16,156
If only I can keep them
cold enough long enough

412
00:36:26,706 --> 00:36:28,206
it's going to work

413
00:36:44,515 --> 00:36:47,775
All right, there she is. Let's try it
Step back, girls.

414
00:36:55,895 --> 00:36:58,284
All right, bring her on. Come on

415
00:37:01,814 --> 00:37:03,654
Now do you think it'll Work?

416
00:37:24,713 --> 00:37:27,353
Good morning, Mr. Trask
-Good morning.

417
00:37:30,133 --> 00:37:32,553
Somebody swiped our coal chute
right off the wagon.

418
00:37:32,643 --> 00:37:35,143
Dear, dear.
Times are getting pretty lawless

419
00:37:35,223 --> 00:37:36,313
it's this war in Europe

420
00:37:36,393 --> 00:37:39,983
There's a wave of lawlessness
spreading through the country

421
00:37:40,063 --> 00:37:41,983
Anyway, somebody swiped our chute

422
00:37:42,063 --> 00:37:43,653
Is that where you're loading?
-Yes.

423
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:45,653
We'll move on, then. Good day, Mr. Trask

424
00:37:45,733 --> 00:37:47,413
it's this war in Europe

425
00:38:01,582 --> 00:38:03,382
Do you know where Aron is?

426
00:38:04,632 --> 00:38:06,762
He's out in the fields. He's checking

427
00:38:06,842 --> 00:38:07,962
Can I do something for you?

428
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:11,262
No. There were just some matters
I want to talk over with him.

429
00:38:11,342 --> 00:38:13,062
What have you got there?

430
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:17,481
I figured it would save some time. Sol

431
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:21,271
it's very ingenious, Cal. Very ingenious
Did you think of it?

432
00:38:21,351 --> 00:38:22,991
Yep

433
00:38:23,061 --> 00:38:25,531
I'm very pleased
with the way you're taking hold

434
00:38:25,611 --> 00:38:27,281
and are working so Well, Cal

435
00:38:27,361 --> 00:38:29,111
Thanks. Thanks, Dad

436
00:38:34,451 --> 00:38:37,581
Think you better have your lunch now
it's time.

437
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,130
Hi, Cal

438
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:46,090
Aron's out in the field
-I brought his lunch.

439
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,050
Okay, I'll take it to him
-Cal.

440
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,229
Lydia, vamoose

441
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:19,539
He'll be herein a minute

442
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:23,329
I've been fixing Aron's lunch.
I'll fix yours, too, if you like, after this

443
00:39:23,409 --> 00:39:24,999
No, thanks

444
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:29,298
Would you be eating with her
if I weren't here?

445
00:39:29,378 --> 00:39:30,418
Who?

446
00:39:34,168 --> 00:39:36,478
No, I didn't ask her to come up here

447
00:39:40,508 --> 00:39:42,568
Girls follow you around, don't they?

448
00:39:42,638 --> 00:39:45,648
-Does she bother you?
She doesn't bother me

449
00:39:46,478 --> 00:39:47,688
Who is she?

450
00:39:50,358 --> 00:39:52,528
I never saw her before in my life

451
00:39:54,147 --> 00:39:55,447
I'll bet

452
00:39:58,277 --> 00:40:01,497
You're really working
at this lettuce business, aren't you, Cal?

453
00:40:01,987 --> 00:40:03,797
Do you think it'll turn out all right?

454
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:06,637
Your father will lose quite a lot of money
if it doesn't.

455
00:40:06,707 --> 00:40:08,377
Just about all he's got

456
00:40:09,037 --> 00:40:11,087
I like your father

457
00:40:12,337 --> 00:40:13,347
Do you?

458
00:40:18,087 --> 00:40:20,806
I threw away about $3,000 once

459
00:40:21,426 --> 00:40:22,436
Yeah?

460
00:40:24,016 --> 00:40:26,096
-When I was 13.
You threw it away?

461
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:27,986
It was a diamond ring worth about that

462
00:40:28,056 --> 00:40:30,646
At least, my father told me
that's what he paid for it.

463
00:40:30,726 --> 00:40:34,156
I threw it in the river.
Made Dad terribly angry

464
00:40:36,396 --> 00:40:38,236
I reckon it would

465
00:40:38,316 --> 00:40:41,036
But I forgave him.
And it's been all right ever since

466
00:40:41,116 --> 00:40:42,666
You forgave him?
-Yes.

467
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:49,165
You forgave him 'cause you threw
a ring of his worth $3,000 into the river?

468
00:40:49,245 --> 00:40:50,885
-That's right.
And you forgave him?

469
00:40:50,955 --> 00:40:52,595
That's right

470
00:40:52,665 --> 00:40:54,805
Is there an egg in this basket?

471
00:40:56,415 --> 00:41:00,045
You see, I thought he didn't love me
That made me feel awful.

472
00:41:01,595 --> 00:41:03,895
Girls love their fathers terribly

473
00:41:04,465 --> 00:41:05,765
Do they?

474
00:41:06,975 --> 00:41:08,775
My mother died when I was 13

475
00:41:08,845 --> 00:41:12,064
and Dad got married again soon after that
Did you know that?

476
00:41:12,144 --> 00:41:14,114
No, I didn't know that

477
00:41:15,314 --> 00:41:17,444
Are you interested in hearing about me?

478
00:41:17,524 --> 00:41:18,614
Yeah

479
00:41:22,404 --> 00:41:25,864
When Dad got married again
it made me sick.

480
00:41:26,904 --> 00:41:28,624
I just hated everybody

481
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:31,534
I used to sit and just glare at people

482
00:41:31,624 --> 00:41:34,414
or I wouldn't even answer
when they spoke to me.

483
00:41:36,543 --> 00:41:39,593
Why you telling me all this?
-I want to.

484
00:41:40,213 --> 00:41:43,673
I was that way for months
I just hated everybody.

485
00:41:43,753 --> 00:41:46,093
I thought nobody in the world loved me

486
00:41:48,053 --> 00:41:50,303
And it was awful

487
00:41:52,473 --> 00:41:55,483
Then I found this ring
that Dad gave my new mother

488
00:41:56,893 --> 00:41:59,653
so I took it and threw it in the river
-Good.

489
00:42:01,142 --> 00:42:02,952
I thought you'd like that

490
00:42:04,402 --> 00:42:06,242
Did he ever find it?
-Never.

491
00:42:08,402 --> 00:42:09,912
They tried

492
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:12,542
What'd they do to you?

493
00:42:12,612 --> 00:42:15,462
Dad punished me. Not badly, I guess

494
00:42:15,532 --> 00:42:18,172
But I felt
he shouldn't have punished me at all

495
00:42:18,252 --> 00:42:21,762
I felt he should have loved me more
because I did it.

496
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:23,422
But he didn't

497
00:42:24,252 --> 00:42:26,391
isn't it funny?

498
00:42:27,301 --> 00:42:29,271
I'm grown up now

499
00:42:29,341 --> 00:42:31,931
but I still understand kids better
than I do grownups.

500
00:42:32,011 --> 00:42:33,181
You're not so grown-up

501
00:42:33,261 --> 00:42:35,511
-I'm very grown-up.
That's a matter of opinion

502
00:42:35,601 --> 00:42:37,101
I'm very grown-up

503
00:42:37,181 --> 00:42:40,691
More so than Dad, because I forgave him
for not understanding.

504
00:42:43,401 --> 00:42:45,901
And the minute I forgave him in my mind

505
00:42:46,611 --> 00:42:48,201
I felt better

506
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,460
Now we get along fine

507
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:02,550
We love each other.
Not like we did when I was 13

508
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,640
but enough so we can live together
till I get married.

509
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,890
He's just my father now
Nothing to rave about.

510
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,899
I still don't like her much
but then, she's a woman

511
00:43:29,609 --> 00:43:32,869
My, that girl just hates me, doesn't she?

512
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:36,159
You better tell her I'm your brother's girl

513
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,959
I don't have to explain anything
to anybody.

514
00:43:41,908 --> 00:43:44,298
I'll go now and leave the field to her

515
00:43:48,338 --> 00:43:50,468
My, your hair's in a mess

516
00:43:54,088 --> 00:43:56,008
Dad, what's that?

517
00:43:56,088 --> 00:43:59,438
That's something Cal rigged up
it's a good idea.

518
00:43:59,508 --> 00:44:01,678
Aron! I brought your lunch

519
00:44:02,308 --> 00:44:04,778
Looks like a coal chute

520
00:44:05,098 --> 00:44:06,897
Coal chute?

521
00:44:10,357 --> 00:44:12,027
Okay, woman, where's the beans?

522
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:13,117
Cal!

523
00:44:15,817 --> 00:44:19,617
What makes you think you have the right
to come and take something like this?

524
00:44:19,697 --> 00:44:23,047
You probably lost those men their jobs
Now, you take it back.

525
00:44:30,587 --> 00:44:33,926
He's praising Cal and Cal is lapping it up

526
00:44:34,006 --> 00:44:36,636
Aron! Look, have one of those
made of wood.

527
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:39,016
It'll save a lot of time
-Yes, sir!

528
00:44:42,386 --> 00:44:44,636
Good waste of time and money
-And lettuce.

529
00:44:44,716 --> 00:44:47,896
-What'd you say?
I said, it's a good idea if it works

530
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,446
it's gonna work, 'cause it's gotta Work

531
00:44:50,516 --> 00:44:52,656
it's gotta work, 'cause I said so

532
00:44:54,646 --> 00:44:56,735
If it don't work, it ain't that kid's fault

533
00:44:56,815 --> 00:44:59,155
I never saw anybody work
so hard in my life.

534
00:45:02,615 --> 00:45:05,165
Let's go, Pete. Now, Leonard!

535
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,535
Good luck, Adam

536
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:47,083
Do you know the principle
of the internal combustion engine?

537
00:45:47,153 --> 00:45:49,703
No, I'm afraid not.
Will, I'll never be able to

538
00:45:49,783 --> 00:45:51,873
Sure you will. You just listen to Roy

539
00:45:51,953 --> 00:45:54,203
He's been to the automobile school
in Chicago.

540
00:45:54,283 --> 00:45:57,213
Mr. Trask has just revolutionized
the entire vegetable market.

541
00:45:57,293 --> 00:46:00,003
Wait till those cars get to New York
-Don't you worry.

542
00:46:00,083 --> 00:46:02,173
It's about time he owned
his own automobile...

543
00:46:02,253 --> 00:46:04,013
and about time he learned to drive it

544
00:46:04,093 --> 00:46:06,643
Now don't you think so, Roy?
-I'll do my best.

545
00:46:06,713 --> 00:46:08,723
Now pay strict attention, boys

546
00:46:09,673 --> 00:46:10,853
Don't touch that!

547
00:46:10,933 --> 00:46:12,562
Wait till it's explained to you

548
00:46:12,642 --> 00:46:15,682
No, now for heaven's sake,
don't touch anything, anybody

549
00:46:16,512 --> 00:46:19,532
The power of the explosion
is exerted on a piston...

550
00:46:19,602 --> 00:46:23,232
and through connecting rod
and crankshaft...

551
00:46:23,312 --> 00:46:27,162
through transmission
thence to rear wheels

552
00:46:27,232 --> 00:46:29,952
-Got that so far?
Sure, he's got that

553
00:46:30,032 --> 00:46:33,082
Now, we go on
to the operation of the automobile

554
00:46:34,202 --> 00:46:36,122
This here's the ignition key

555
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:39,881
Would you mind putting out
that cigarette, please.

556
00:46:39,961 --> 00:46:43,131
Turn this doohickey here to the left
That puts her on battery.

557
00:46:43,211 --> 00:46:45,261
See where it says "bat"?
-Yes.

558
00:46:45,341 --> 00:46:48,801
-Bat, short for battery.
That's right. Good boy

559
00:46:49,261 --> 00:46:50,761
Thank you. Thank you very much

560
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:52,391
First you gotta retard the spark

561
00:46:52,471 --> 00:46:56,181
If you don't retard the spark,
she'll probably kick your blasted arm off

562
00:46:56,261 --> 00:46:57,851
Now remember that

563
00:46:57,971 --> 00:46:59,561
This here is the spark

564
00:46:59,641 --> 00:47:02,900
You push her way up. Listen

565
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:07,400
This here's the gas. You push her
-Down.

566
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:11,500
You had lessons before
No, I just saw you do it

567
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,210
You're a pretty smart old buzzard
-Thank you very much.

568
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,790
Keep your eyes open, don't you?
-Try to.

569
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:20,210
Now, this here is the crank

570
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:23,500
See this wire sticking out of the radiator?
That's the choke.

571
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:26,430
Now watch careful.
Grab hold of the crank like this

572
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,969
Push in till she catches

573
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:29,549
See how my thumb is turned down?

574
00:47:29,629 --> 00:47:31,179
I noticed that. Why do you do that?

575
00:47:31,259 --> 00:47:34,099
If you put her around this way
with my thumb around her...

576
00:47:34,179 --> 00:47:36,179
she'd probably knock
my blasted thumb off

577
00:47:36,259 --> 00:47:40,269
Dear, dear. First you lose your blasted arm
and then you lose your blasted thumb.

578
00:47:40,349 --> 00:47:42,439
That's kind of Wrong way around
-How's that?

579
00:47:42,519 --> 00:47:45,779
He made a joke.
I never did see him so happy

580
00:47:46,269 --> 00:47:49,369
You pull out this choke
turn her around to suck gas in

581
00:47:49,979 --> 00:47:52,039
Then you give her a hard spin

582
00:47:52,398 --> 00:47:55,668
She caught, first time!
-Caught on what?

583
00:47:56,488 --> 00:47:58,328
Advance the spark and retard the gas

584
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:01,088
Reach over real quick and switch
to mag. That's magneto.

585
00:48:01,158 --> 00:48:03,048
So, there you are

586
00:48:03,118 --> 00:48:05,668
isn't that wonderful?

587
00:48:05,748 --> 00:48:08,298
Of course, it isn't exactly
going anywhere, is it?

588
00:48:08,378 --> 00:48:09,418
That's the easy part

589
00:48:09,498 --> 00:48:11,388
-Adam.
I want you all to repeat after me

590
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:14,048
Spark up, gas down

591
00:48:14,128 --> 00:48:15,518
Switch to bat

592
00:48:15,588 --> 00:48:18,357
Crank to compression, thumb down

593
00:48:18,427 --> 00:48:20,397
You get that? Let's have it again

594
00:48:20,467 --> 00:48:22,557
Spark up, gas down

595
00:48:22,637 --> 00:48:24,857
What's the matter?
-Big snow slide.

596
00:48:24,927 --> 00:48:27,897
Closed the pass and stopped the cars
about 100 miles out.

597
00:48:27,977 --> 00:48:30,697
Can see water running out of the cars

598
00:48:43,616 --> 00:48:46,666
it's still a good idea.
Cold can preserve things

599
00:48:46,746 --> 00:48:48,666
Someday, somebody'll prove it

600
00:48:50,496 --> 00:48:52,886
It was your idea
-No!

601
00:48:52,956 --> 00:48:55,806
It was presumptuous of me
to think it would be I.

602
00:48:57,876 --> 00:49:00,726
Guess we bit off more lettuce
than we could chew.

603
00:49:02,466 --> 00:49:05,976
What do you know about that?
I thought he'd really be hurt.

604
00:49:07,386 --> 00:49:09,695
You don't understand him

605
00:49:10,805 --> 00:49:13,065
-You can't go in there.
I gotta see Will Hamilton

606
00:49:13,145 --> 00:49:15,565
He won't be through for an hour
They just started.

607
00:49:15,645 --> 00:49:17,735
-Let me see him.
There's a war in Europe

608
00:49:17,815 --> 00:49:20,825
These boys are trying
to get themselves in shape. So beat it

609
00:49:20,905 --> 00:49:22,455
Right, left

610
00:49:36,754 --> 00:49:38,594
Now, deep knee bends, follow me

611
00:49:51,434 --> 00:49:53,234
-What's that?
That's the fire bell

612
00:49:53,304 --> 00:49:54,984
We better have a look

613
00:49:57,144 --> 00:50:00,653
-It may be the Germans.
Fire, Germans, who cares? I surrender

614
00:50:02,483 --> 00:50:04,073
Howdy, Mr. Albrecht
-Hello, Cal.

615
00:50:04,153 --> 00:50:06,043
-Mr. Hamilton.
There's a fire somewhere

616
00:50:06,113 --> 00:50:07,623
No. I rang the bell
-You rang it?

617
00:50:07,693 --> 00:50:08,743
Yeah. I had to see you

618
00:50:08,823 --> 00:50:10,793
You know, you're crazy
You're really crazy.

619
00:50:10,863 --> 00:50:13,203
I knew it when you pushed that ice
down the chute.

620
00:50:13,323 --> 00:50:16,213
Let's get out of here
before they start up that piano again

621
00:50:16,293 --> 00:50:19,583
There must be some easier way
to stop the Germans than this, anyway

622
00:50:19,663 --> 00:50:23,213
You see, I gotta make some money
-Sure, everybody's got to.

623
00:50:24,632 --> 00:50:27,842
Remember, you said that
if you wanna make money.

624
00:50:27,922 --> 00:50:29,222
You ought to raise beans?

625
00:50:29,302 --> 00:50:31,552
Yeah, beans are up 3.5 cents now

626
00:50:31,632 --> 00:50:33,892
Now, the way I figure it, it's like you said

627
00:50:33,972 --> 00:50:36,142
The country's gonna get into war, isn't it?

628
00:50:36,222 --> 00:50:38,112
I don't see any way out

629
00:50:38,182 --> 00:50:41,692
War's good for business
-The best there is.

630
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:45,282
See, that's why I wanna go into beans

631
00:50:45,732 --> 00:50:49,331
See, I gotta get enough money
to give my father back what he lost

632
00:50:51,151 --> 00:50:52,581
I see

633
00:50:53,661 --> 00:50:55,911
You think you can make
all that money back?

634
00:50:55,991 --> 00:50:57,381
I gotta

635
00:50:57,451 --> 00:50:59,371
You know, you're crazy

636
00:50:59,871 --> 00:51:02,171
Look, Cal, don't you know

637
00:51:02,251 --> 00:51:05,051
that you gotta have money
in order to make money?

638
00:51:05,461 --> 00:51:07,471
I'll get some money
-How?

639
00:51:08,251 --> 00:51:09,431
I'll get it

640
00:51:10,011 --> 00:51:13,521
Look, don't get so near to me.
I don't wanna get all hot again

641
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:16,480
How much money could you get?
-What do you think I need?

642
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:18,730
If you had $5,000

643
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,400
$5,000?

644
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:29,200
It's a little different when you start
putting it into figures, isn't it?

645
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,660
I know you wanna help your father

646
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:36,870
but a kid your age can't be expected
to put his hands on $5,000.

647
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:40,579
Maybe if you could raise $100 or so
we could let you have a little share

648
00:51:40,659 --> 00:51:43,129
I don't want a little share
I want the whole thing.

649
00:51:43,209 --> 00:51:46,009
-I'll get $5,000.
Maybe if you and Aron Went in together

650
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:48,759
Aron ain't got nothing to do with this
This is my deal.

651
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:49,879
I'll get the $5,000

652
00:51:49,959 --> 00:51:51,969
What're you gonna do, borrow it?

653
00:51:54,299 --> 00:51:55,309
Yeah

654
00:51:56,469 --> 00:51:58,769
All right. If you can borrow $5,000

655
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:01,609
I know a farmer who's got over 800 acres

656
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:04,608
-it's under cultivation.
All right. What do we do?

657
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:08,028
If we can guarantee him 5 cents a pound

658
00:52:08,108 --> 00:52:10,568
and make him a seed loan
he'll plant beans.

659
00:52:10,648 --> 00:52:12,118
So will a lot of other farmers

660
00:52:12,188 --> 00:52:15,078
Why, we can contract
all the bean acreage you want

661
00:52:17,028 --> 00:52:20,538
That's it. That's great. When do we start?

662
00:52:21,488 --> 00:52:23,958
How do you know the price
will go above 5, though?

663
00:52:24,078 --> 00:52:25,968
Did you read the newspapers
this morning?

664
00:52:26,038 --> 00:52:28,298
We're apt to be in war any minute

665
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:32,087
You know I got a contract
with the British Purchasing Agency

666
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:34,507
and I got a friend in
the Quartermaster Corps

667
00:52:34,587 --> 00:52:37,007
Do you know
that we could sell all the dry beans

668
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:39,257
that we can find
at 10 cents a pound or more?

669
00:52:39,347 --> 00:52:42,147
That's what I want. That's it. See?

670
00:52:42,967 --> 00:52:45,437
-How much will I make?
Enough for what you want

671
00:53:33,975 --> 00:53:36,695
What does Cal stand for?
-Caleb.

672
00:53:37,605 --> 00:53:39,275
It's in the Bible

673
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:44,574
What's your brother's name?
-Aron.

674
00:53:45,694 --> 00:53:47,454
That's in the Bible, too

675
00:53:51,704 --> 00:53:53,044
What's he like?

676
00:53:55,204 --> 00:53:57,124
He looks like you

677
00:53:59,334 --> 00:54:00,974
Is he like me?

678
00:54:01,044 --> 00:54:03,134
No. He's good

679
00:54:07,264 --> 00:54:08,684
I'm more like you

680
00:54:12,513 --> 00:54:13,903
How's Adam?

681
00:54:14,683 --> 00:54:16,193
How's your father?

682
00:54:17,813 --> 00:54:19,703
I don't wanna talk about him

683
00:54:28,243 --> 00:54:30,743
You don't?
-No.

684
00:54:38,832 --> 00:54:41,802
I didn't know who you were
when you were here before.

685
00:54:42,382 --> 00:54:44,212
I knew you didn't

686
00:54:48,012 --> 00:54:50,222
Aren't you afraid
to come around here again?

687
00:54:50,302 --> 00:54:52,852
Yeah, I am. No. Well, kind of

688
00:54:57,812 --> 00:54:59,232
What do you want?

689
00:55:01,561 --> 00:55:03,531
Just to look at me?

690
00:55:09,071 --> 00:55:10,991
I want $5,000

691
00:55:24,381 --> 00:55:27,010
All right, come on in. Sit down

692
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:28,890
Come in

693
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:31,890
Try that chair

694
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:36,610
You got your father's eyes

695
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:39,940
That's all I can see of him

696
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:44,280
You're a nice looking boy
-Yes, ma'am.

697
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,119
I was very beautiful once
-Yes, ma'am.

698
00:55:55,569 --> 00:55:57,249
Caleb and Aron

699
00:55:57,659 --> 00:56:00,459
Your father still thinks
he's living in the Bible, huh?

700
00:56:00,539 --> 00:56:01,919
Them's just names

701
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:05,089
Joe says that you go to school in Salinas

702
00:56:05,169 --> 00:56:07,089
Are you good in your studies?

703
00:56:08,919 --> 00:56:10,889
I get by with them

704
00:56:10,959 --> 00:56:12,969
Does Aron get by with them?

705
00:56:13,049 --> 00:56:14,219
He's bright

706
00:56:15,509 --> 00:56:19,018
What are you gonna do when you finish?
You're going to college?

707
00:56:19,928 --> 00:56:20,938
Maybe

708
00:56:21,388 --> 00:56:24,358
Or back to some ranch?

709
00:56:24,438 --> 00:56:27,278
No, I don't like the ranch

710
00:56:28,228 --> 00:56:29,948
You take after me

711
00:56:30,648 --> 00:56:34,158
Makes me mad just to think about a ranch

712
00:56:35,858 --> 00:56:37,158
Sit down

713
00:56:42,037 --> 00:56:43,037
Thanks

714
00:56:50,457 --> 00:56:52,757
What do you want with $5,000?

715
00:56:53,507 --> 00:56:55,257
I want to go into business

716
00:56:55,337 --> 00:56:58,687
You're a little young for that, aren't you?
-I'm old enough.

717
00:56:59,177 --> 00:57:01,727
Yeah, I guess you're right. I guess you are

718
00:57:02,467 --> 00:57:05,017
What business do you wanna go into?
-Beans.

719
00:57:08,146 --> 00:57:10,906
Beans are up to 3.5 cents now

720
00:57:10,976 --> 00:57:13,616
And if we get into war,
they're gonna go up to 10, 12

721
00:57:13,686 --> 00:57:16,486
-If we get into the war.
That's a gamble you have to take

722
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:18,706
Will Hamilton says that
-Will?

723
00:57:18,776 --> 00:57:21,116
You going into business
with Will Hamilton?

724
00:57:21,196 --> 00:57:22,586
You see

725
00:57:24,536 --> 00:57:28,046
my father, he lost about all he had in

726
00:57:28,116 --> 00:57:31,135
Yeah, I know. I heard about that

727
00:57:32,795 --> 00:57:35,885
I wanna make enough to pay him back

728
00:57:36,715 --> 00:57:40,005
What's the matter with him?
Can't he make any money?

729
00:57:40,085 --> 00:57:41,055
Yeah

730
00:57:43,845 --> 00:57:44,855
Only

731
00:57:46,225 --> 00:57:49,735
Only he's too good to bother with money

732
00:57:53,065 --> 00:57:54,065
Okay

733
00:57:58,734 --> 00:58:01,744
What makes you think I'd give you $5,000?

734
00:58:06,494 --> 00:58:08,574
I don't know who else to ask

735
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:12,834
You got a lot of nerve coming to me

736
00:58:12,914 --> 00:58:15,794
Why? I didn't do anything to you

737
00:58:21,543 --> 00:58:23,843
it's a good business venture

738
00:58:26,883 --> 00:58:29,653
I'll pay you back. I'll give you interest

739
00:58:29,723 --> 00:58:32,403
You're a business woman, ain't you?

740
00:58:32,473 --> 00:58:33,983
One of the best, Son

741
00:58:35,263 --> 00:58:40,103
You know, Sam told me that you think
I ought to be run out of town.

742
00:58:43,403 --> 00:58:47,492
You're afraid that your father and Aron
might find out about me, is that it?

743
00:58:51,492 --> 00:58:53,712
This $5,000, now

744
00:58:53,782 --> 00:58:56,632
That wouldn't be
any kind of blackmail, would it?

745
00:58:56,702 --> 00:58:58,462
I never thought about that

746
00:58:59,292 --> 00:59:01,792
But now that you do, it's a good idea, huh?

747
00:59:03,212 --> 00:59:05,262
I guess, maybe
-it's not.

748
00:59:09,552 --> 00:59:13,061
Anyway, I'm not gonna hurt
your precious father or your brother

749
00:59:13,761 --> 00:59:16,061
Do they know anything about me?
-No.

750
00:59:16,391 --> 00:59:18,561
Father thinks you're in the East

751
00:59:19,891 --> 00:59:21,781
and Aron thinks you're dead

752
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:26,821
Then, there's no reason to think
that they ever will find out about me

753
00:59:26,901 --> 00:59:30,081
We don't exactly move in the same circles

754
00:59:36,491 --> 00:59:38,210
What are you staring at?

755
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,670
How come you did it?

756
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:43,670
Did what?

757
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:46,680
Shot my father?

758
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:50,010
Did he tell you that?

759
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,770
How come you ran away from all of us?
How come you shot him?

760
00:59:55,850 --> 00:59:59,190
Ran away and did all that kind of stuff?
-None of your business.

761
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,939
I shot him because he tried to stop me

762
01:00:03,889 --> 01:00:06,529
I could have killed him if I'd wanted to
but I didn't.

763
01:00:06,609 --> 01:00:08,859
I just wanted him to let me go

764
01:00:09,529 --> 01:00:13,039
-Why?
Because he tried to hold me

765
01:00:14,779 --> 01:00:16,039
He wanted to tie me down

766
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:18,749
He wanted to keep me
on a stinking little ranch

767
01:00:18,829 --> 01:00:21,079
away from everybody.
Keep me all to himself

768
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:23,379
Nobody holds me

769
01:00:23,959 --> 01:00:25,929
But he loved you
-Love.

770
01:00:27,628 --> 01:00:29,598
He wanted to own me

771
01:00:30,208 --> 01:00:32,848
He wanted to bring me up
like a snot-nosed kid...

772
01:00:32,918 --> 01:00:36,638
and tell me what to do.
Nobody tells me what to do

773
01:00:38,138 --> 01:00:41,478
Always so right himself
Knowing everything.

774
01:00:42,268 --> 01:00:44,398
Reading the Bible at me

775
01:00:45,228 --> 01:00:47,558
What are you grinning at?
-Nothing.

776
01:00:48,938 --> 01:00:51,238
Maybe you know what I'm talking about?

777
01:00:52,487 --> 01:00:54,237
Always so right himself?

778
01:00:54,857 --> 01:00:56,117
Yeah
Yeah

779
01:00:57,657 --> 01:01:00,917
Maybe like you said out there
maybe you are more like me.

780
01:01:04,407 --> 01:01:06,167
Yeah, you got sense

781
01:01:06,707 --> 01:01:09,967
Maybe you don't fall for that slop
any more than I do.

782
01:01:10,037 --> 01:01:13,807
Maybe you know what people
are really like. What they want

783
01:01:13,877 --> 01:01:16,977
I got the toughest house on the coast

784
01:01:17,047 --> 01:01:19,386
and the finest clientele

785
01:01:21,556 --> 01:01:24,106
Half the stinking city hall go there

786
01:01:25,676 --> 01:01:27,356
They sneak in at night

787
01:01:27,436 --> 01:01:30,366
and I walk in this front door
in the daytime, see.

788
01:01:31,226 --> 01:01:33,196
And I built it up from nothing

789
01:01:34,436 --> 01:01:36,656
Now you want $5,000 of my money

790
01:01:36,736 --> 01:01:39,586
to go into business
to pay your father back what he lost

791
01:01:39,776 --> 01:01:41,286
You know, that's funny

792
01:01:42,276 --> 01:01:45,045
I don't think he'll know where I got it

793
01:01:45,115 --> 01:01:47,505
No, but it's funny just the same

794
01:01:48,365 --> 01:01:49,795
Your father

795
01:01:50,535 --> 01:01:52,925
He's the purest man there is, isn't he?

796
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:57,465
He thought he had me all tied up
with his purity.

797
01:01:58,125 --> 01:02:01,425
And now I give you $5,000
of the money that I made..

798
01:02:01,505 --> 01:02:03,765
To save him his purity

799
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:08,054
If you don't think that's funny
you'd better not go to college

800
01:02:17,854 --> 01:02:18,864
Okay

801
01:02:22,984 --> 01:02:25,284
Tell Will Hamilton to come and see me

802
01:02:27,904 --> 01:02:29,664
He's a good businessman

803
01:02:33,034 --> 01:02:36,713
How'd he ever happen to let you go
into this bean business, anyway?

804
01:02:37,203 --> 01:02:38,463
I don't know

805
01:02:40,003 --> 01:02:42,133
I do. Maybe he likes you

806
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:44,343
Maybe

807
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:49,313
You're a likable kid

808
01:02:58,732 --> 01:03:00,532
You give this to him

809
01:03:01,942 --> 01:03:04,952
If he wants to gamble
that we get into the war

810
01:03:05,022 --> 01:03:06,412
it's okay with me

811
01:03:26,001 --> 01:03:27,591
You're a likable kid

812
01:03:35,351 --> 01:03:37,271
Go on, get out of here

813
01:03:40,101 --> 01:03:42,691
Go on, get out. I'm running a business

814
01:04:25,349 --> 01:04:27,319
Them Germans can't fight
-No.

815
01:04:54,968 --> 01:04:56,008
Hi, partner

816
01:04:56,548 --> 01:04:59,648
Every day in every way,
we're getting richer and richer

817
01:05:04,597 --> 01:05:05,777
Kaiser

818
01:05:05,847 --> 01:05:09,147
All we have to do is call his bluff
He'll come to heel like a dog.

819
01:05:15,397 --> 01:05:19,367
We'll be there to clean up this mess
for those foreigners in a couple of weeks

820
01:05:34,836 --> 01:05:36,476
Cal, stop it

821
01:05:38,586 --> 01:05:39,766
There's Cal

822
01:05:45,596 --> 01:05:48,446
Hi, boy. Hey, want some?
-Hello, Cal.

823
01:05:48,976 --> 01:05:49,986
Thanks

824
01:05:58,695 --> 01:06:02,745
Your own Woodrow Wilson said you gotta
make the country safe for democracy.

825
01:06:03,155 --> 01:06:05,375
Didn't he say that?
-Yes, he said that.

826
01:06:05,445 --> 01:06:06,575
Will you go?

827
01:06:06,655 --> 01:06:08,745
I think the war will be over. I don't think

828
01:06:08,825 --> 01:06:12,455
If you believe in all this, why don't you?
If you really think it's right.

829
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:14,175
I didn't say it was right, Aron

830
01:06:14,245 --> 01:06:16,255
No, I guess you didn't

831
01:06:18,585 --> 01:06:21,054
Why don't you go back
and join the parade?

832
01:06:27,344 --> 01:06:30,944
Nothing'll ever make me go. Nothing

833
01:06:32,514 --> 01:06:34,684
I just don't believe it's right

834
01:06:51,533 --> 01:06:53,793
Did you water them good?
-Sure, lots of water.

835
01:06:53,873 --> 01:06:56,093
Not too much, though
-No, just right.

836
01:07:14,392 --> 01:07:17,322
Marty Hopps got a telegram today
His boy was killed.

837
01:07:17,392 --> 01:07:19,482
I remember the day we sent him off

838
01:07:22,022 --> 01:07:24,792
A lot of troop ships have sunk
they don't tell us about.

839
01:07:24,862 --> 01:07:27,412
-it's gonna be along war.
Those Germans got an army

840
01:07:27,482 --> 01:07:29,212
They're a military nation

841
01:07:29,572 --> 01:07:31,662
Go back Where you came from, German!

842
01:07:31,742 --> 01:07:33,382
Go on home, German!

843
01:07:40,871 --> 01:07:42,211
This is just the start

844
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:44,711
That rock through the window
is just the beginning.

845
01:07:44,791 --> 01:07:46,551
The German people don't want this war

846
01:07:46,631 --> 01:07:49,391
And the stories they tell
of what the Germans are doing

847
01:07:49,461 --> 01:07:51,551
it simply is not true. Not the good ones

848
01:07:51,631 --> 01:07:54,981
I've been wondering lately
if we shouldn't all go back to the ranch

849
01:07:55,051 --> 01:07:57,361
You can't get away from it there, Dad

850
01:07:58,101 --> 01:08:01,610
I don't know, somehow, on a ranch
I don't know ....

851
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:05,200
War seems to be
city people's business somehow

852
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:09,530
Farmers. What's a farmer got to do
with war?

853
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:12,820
You tired, Dad?

854
01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:17,960
My eyes, I guess.
I work too hard at the Draft Board

855
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:22,710
Better have my glasses looked at
see if they're all right.

856
01:08:25,330 --> 01:08:28,259
I had a look at the bank account
the other day...

857
01:08:28,339 --> 01:08:30,969
not much left after my great fiasco

858
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:36,479
Let's not worry about money, Dad

859
01:08:36,549 --> 01:08:38,639
Let's not worry about money, Dad

860
01:08:42,229 --> 01:08:44,149
Let's don't worry about money

861
01:08:53,648 --> 01:08:55,458
Hey, Rantani!

862
01:08:56,658 --> 01:08:58,498
Ain't this some sight?

863
01:08:58,578 --> 01:09:00,048
Beans!

864
01:09:00,868 --> 01:09:02,838
Yeah, boy, some beans

865
01:09:02,908 --> 01:09:05,628
You come here everyday, boy
what do you think...

866
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:07,798
you gonna make them grow quicker?

867
01:09:17,257 --> 01:09:18,547
He's crazy

868
01:09:25,387 --> 01:09:28,737
Hey, where have you been?

869
01:09:28,807 --> 01:09:31,657
Come on

870
01:09:31,727 --> 01:09:33,697
We're gonna have lots of fun tonight

871
01:09:45,826 --> 01:09:48,326
You won another cigar
-Wait a minute.

872
01:09:49,626 --> 01:09:52,306
You wanna try one? No?

873
01:09:55,086 --> 01:09:56,376
Pick up my cigar

874
01:09:56,466 --> 01:09:58,846
I'm waiting for somebody
-You're waiting for me.

875
01:09:58,926 --> 01:09:59,966
No, I'm not

876
01:10:00,046 --> 01:10:02,136
Why don't you let me
take you for a nice ride?

877
01:10:02,216 --> 01:10:04,986
If you don't stop bothering me
I'll have to call someone.

878
01:10:05,056 --> 01:10:07,025
-Hello, Cal.
What's the matter?

879
01:10:07,135 --> 01:10:10,485
I was trying to tell this gentleman
that I was waiting for somebody.

880
01:10:10,555 --> 01:10:13,525
This is a lousy place
to keep your girlfriend waiting for you

881
01:10:13,605 --> 01:10:15,495
Sir, it won't happen again
-I hope not.

882
01:10:15,565 --> 01:10:18,415
Lots of lousy characters around here
Sorry, miss.

883
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:20,705
Here I am, lady

884
01:10:22,525 --> 01:10:24,705
That's the first time
that ever happened to me

885
01:10:24,785 --> 01:10:27,495
What're you doing out here?
-I'm meeting Aron.

886
01:10:27,575 --> 01:10:30,545
I thought I'd come out early
and look around.

887
01:10:30,625 --> 01:10:34,134
You never been out here before?
-Not at night, no.

888
01:10:35,414 --> 01:10:37,304
What time you gonna meet him?
-At 8:00.

889
01:10:37,374 --> 01:10:40,514
Thought I'd try and cheer him up
He's been so depressed lately.

890
01:10:40,584 --> 01:10:41,634
Yeah, I know

891
01:10:41,714 --> 01:10:43,884
I'm so glad you happened to be here

892
01:10:49,844 --> 01:10:50,854
8:00?

893
01:10:52,144 --> 01:10:53,734
You got a half hour?

894
01:10:58,603 --> 01:11:00,903
How are you, Cal?
We never see you around anymore

895
01:11:00,983 --> 01:11:02,073
I'm around

896
01:11:02,153 --> 01:11:05,493
I've been over to the house several times,
but you were never there.

897
01:11:05,573 --> 01:11:08,913
-I never go home anymore.
Aron says he hardly ever sees you

898
01:11:10,243 --> 01:11:12,163
I feel awfully sorry for him

899
01:11:18,043 --> 01:11:20,343
You're terrible

900
01:11:20,423 --> 01:11:23,302
That's the first time
that ever happened to me, too

901
01:11:24,502 --> 01:11:26,722
Wonder if we can see Aron from here

902
01:11:27,842 --> 01:11:30,562
I feel awfully sorry for him
He's right, you know.

903
01:11:30,632 --> 01:11:33,772
I mean, it's awful, the war and people
killing each other.

904
01:11:33,852 --> 01:11:36,692
Why feel sorry for Aron?
Feel sorry for the people.

905
01:11:36,772 --> 01:11:39,452
But it just seems to affect him
so personally.

906
01:11:39,522 --> 01:11:41,442
I'll agree with that

907
01:11:42,652 --> 01:11:43,902
He's right

908
01:11:45,232 --> 01:11:47,041
He's always right

909
01:11:47,151 --> 01:11:49,201
And he has always been right

910
01:11:49,281 --> 01:11:51,031
Now let's talk about something else

911
01:11:51,111 --> 01:11:52,201
All right

912
01:11:53,821 --> 01:11:54,951
8:00

913
01:11:55,241 --> 01:11:56,831
We got a lot to see

914
01:11:58,041 --> 01:12:00,121
Will we be back in time for Aron?

915
01:12:03,631 --> 01:12:05,351
All right. I'd love to

916
01:12:13,090 --> 01:12:14,100
Easy

917
01:12:38,739 --> 01:12:42,259
Here's your cigar,
and where have you been hiding?

918
01:12:45,749 --> 01:12:47,039
Who was that?
-Who?

919
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:49,259
-That girl.
I don't see nobody

920
01:12:49,339 --> 01:12:53,129
She was standing right ....
Girls follow you around, don't they?

921
01:12:54,759 --> 01:12:56,899
What are girls like that like?

922
01:12:57,469 --> 01:12:58,559
All right, never mind

923
01:12:58,639 --> 01:13:01,569
These Huns have been the aggressors
in every war in Europe...

924
01:13:01,639 --> 01:13:03,148
since the time of Julius Caesar

925
01:13:03,228 --> 01:13:06,898
I couldn't attempt to describe to you
the horrors committed by the Germans

926
01:13:06,978 --> 01:13:08,068
Look

927
01:13:08,148 --> 01:13:09,568
Would we have time?

928
01:13:09,858 --> 01:13:11,858
After the Germans had been through

929
01:13:11,938 --> 01:13:14,408
-the women of the town...
That German's here again

930
01:13:14,488 --> 01:13:17,578
It is not true. It is lies, all lies

931
01:13:17,988 --> 01:13:21,458
Come on, Cal. Is it scary?

932
01:13:23,828 --> 01:13:25,168
Here we go

933
01:13:35,257 --> 01:13:37,557
It is lies, all lies

934
01:13:37,637 --> 01:13:40,187
I'd like to give that guy
a piece of my mind.

935
01:13:40,557 --> 01:13:42,397
See over there. That's Castroville

936
01:13:42,467 --> 01:13:44,227
Everything looks so small down there

937
01:13:44,307 --> 01:13:46,107
Higher and higher and higher and higher

938
01:13:46,187 --> 01:13:47,277
What?

939
01:13:47,347 --> 01:13:49,687
Growing and growing
and growing and growing

940
01:13:49,767 --> 01:13:53,646
What are you talking about?
-I'll tell you sometime.

941
01:13:58,486 --> 01:14:00,206
Does Aron really love me?

942
01:14:02,326 --> 01:14:04,326
I seem to have sort of lost him

943
01:14:04,406 --> 01:14:08,206
I mean, we're going
to be married someday, but

944
01:14:08,286 --> 01:14:10,836
Well, if he does love me, he doesn't

945
01:14:11,746 --> 01:14:13,336
I can't tell anymore

946
01:14:16,126 --> 01:14:18,095
Cal, can I ask you something?

947
01:14:19,005 --> 01:14:20,295
Yeah, go ahead

948
01:14:22,095 --> 01:14:24,565
These girls that you always
go around with.

949
01:14:24,635 --> 01:14:28,015
You know, remember there was
that little Mexican girl once.

950
01:14:28,095 --> 01:14:30,065
What are girls like that like?

951
01:14:33,935 --> 01:14:36,105
You don't really love them, do you?

952
01:14:38,025 --> 01:14:41,155
Why do you go out with them?
Is it because you're bad?

953
01:14:42,615 --> 01:14:44,334
You're not angry, are you?

954
01:14:47,324 --> 01:14:50,834
Well, why do you, then? Are you bad?
-Do you think I'm bad?

955
01:14:53,204 --> 01:14:54,594
I don't know

956
01:14:55,834 --> 01:14:59,264
I guess I don't know
what is good and what's bad

957
01:14:59,334 --> 01:15:01,634
I mean, Aron is so good

958
01:15:02,214 --> 01:15:03,804
and I'm not

959
01:15:03,884 --> 01:15:05,974
Not good enough for Aron, anyway

960
01:15:06,054 --> 01:15:08,433
Because sometimes when I'm with Aron

961
01:15:09,013 --> 01:15:11,433
Aron likes to talk about our being in love

962
01:15:11,513 --> 01:15:14,193
and think about it
and that's all right, but

963
01:15:15,353 --> 01:15:18,483
These girls that you go out with, do you

964
01:15:19,733 --> 01:15:22,363
Maybe I don't know what love is, exactly

965
01:15:23,113 --> 01:15:26,623
I know love is good the way Aron says

966
01:15:28,703 --> 01:15:31,083
but it's more than that, it's got to be

967
01:15:33,243 --> 01:15:35,412
I shouldn't talk to you this way

968
01:15:35,492 --> 01:15:37,752
but I don't know who else to talk to

969
01:15:38,332 --> 01:15:40,712
Sometimes I think I'm really bad

970
01:15:41,922 --> 01:15:44,222
Sometimes I don't know what to think

971
01:15:46,962 --> 01:15:49,682
Aron'll knock that out of you
-Will he?

972
01:15:50,932 --> 01:15:52,102
He's got to

973
01:15:53,012 --> 01:15:55,062
The way I figure it out

974
01:15:55,932 --> 01:15:58,072
Aron never having had a mother

975
01:15:59,311 --> 01:16:02,271
he's made her everything good
that he can think of...

976
01:16:02,941 --> 01:16:04,741
and that's what he thinks I am

977
01:16:04,811 --> 01:16:07,661
That's who he's in love with
it's not me at all.

978
01:16:09,361 --> 01:16:12,411
Cause I'm not a bit like that made-up one
Not a bit.

979
01:16:12,781 --> 01:16:15,661
I don't mean I think I'm really bad

980
01:16:18,751 --> 01:16:20,251
Look at that star

981
01:16:21,791 --> 01:16:24,040
It must be a planet, it's so bright

982
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,050
Probably

983
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:34,440
I bet that girl's waiting for you
down there somewhere.

984
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:37,940
She can just wait

985
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:39,940
She was pretty

986
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:46,820
You've been awfully nice, Cal
taking care of me.

987
01:17:07,629 --> 01:17:10,049
I love Aron. I do, really I do

988
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:15,898
do

989
01:17:21,808 --> 01:17:23,018
To give these fiends a lesson that

990
01:17:23,098 --> 01:17:24,608
Have you seen Abra, Mr. Albrecht?

991
01:17:24,688 --> 01:17:25,808
Lies. All lies

992
01:17:25,898 --> 01:17:27,778
What's the matter with you tonight, Gus?

993
01:17:27,858 --> 01:17:29,488
Gus, come on

994
01:17:30,108 --> 01:17:31,528
There's Aron

995
01:17:32,858 --> 01:17:34,528
You're a good Shoemaker

996
01:17:36,608 --> 01:17:38,368
There's Aron, down there

997
01:17:38,448 --> 01:17:40,457
Major, why don't you stay out of politics?

998
01:17:40,537 --> 01:17:41,747
Mr. Albrecht

999
01:17:42,617 --> 01:17:45,917
They're pushing him around
What are they doing?

1000
01:17:47,287 --> 01:17:49,047
That'd kill Dad if he knew that

1001
01:17:49,127 --> 01:17:51,837
Hey, operator,
when does this thing move again

1002
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:52,877
Hey!

1003
01:18:01,427 --> 01:18:03,347
Cal, don't!

1004
01:18:03,427 --> 01:18:05,266
Watch yourself, get back!

1005
01:18:06,686 --> 01:18:08,816
Please. Somebody pull him back

1006
01:18:09,896 --> 01:18:11,366
Don't bother me!

1007
01:18:11,436 --> 01:18:13,156
Come on

1008
01:18:20,576 --> 01:18:23,836
Gus, come on, have a drink
-No, Charlie, no drink.

1009
01:18:30,285 --> 01:18:32,005
What are you waiting for?

1010
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:37,215
Mr. Albrecht, calm down
They're not bad fellows.

1011
01:18:37,295 --> 01:18:39,385
Aron, you are a child

1012
01:18:44,635 --> 01:18:46,935
All I tried to do was buy him a drink

1013
01:18:48,725 --> 01:18:49,815
Gustav

1014
01:18:49,895 --> 01:18:50,985
Silence

1015
01:18:51,055 --> 01:18:53,855
You all loved him a few Weeks ago
what's gotten into you?

1016
01:18:53,935 --> 01:18:55,944
I'm sick of him sticking up
for the Germans.

1017
01:18:56,024 --> 01:18:58,824
You a friend of the Germans?
-I'm a friend of this German.

1018
01:18:58,904 --> 01:19:02,694
There are rose plants in that border there
Please be careful where you step.

1019
01:19:02,774 --> 01:19:06,074
We liked him. He made us laugh
because of his funny German accent

1020
01:19:06,154 --> 01:19:08,704
Let him read this
in his funny German accent

1021
01:19:09,164 --> 01:19:11,844
-What is it?
Let him come down and read it

1022
01:19:11,914 --> 01:19:14,794
He doesn't have to read anything
-I will read it.

1023
01:19:15,254 --> 01:19:16,724
Here, give it to me

1024
01:19:22,043 --> 01:19:24,843
The Government, with deep regret
informs...

1025
01:19:31,053 --> 01:19:35,013
that your son was killed in action
15th of April.

1026
01:19:36,433 --> 01:19:38,523
He died a hero and an American

1027
01:19:43,483 --> 01:19:45,822
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hopps. I did not

1028
01:19:45,902 --> 01:19:47,492
You're not sorry enough

1029
01:19:47,572 --> 01:19:50,922
I don't think he's sorry
-He's not sorry at all.

1030
01:19:50,992 --> 01:19:54,122
Listen, why don't we all go on home
-You're not sorry enough.

1031
01:19:54,202 --> 01:19:56,292
Why aren't you in the war?

1032
01:19:56,372 --> 01:19:58,092
This will make you sorry

1033
01:20:28,321 --> 01:20:29,661
Hello, Charlie

1034
01:20:30,401 --> 01:20:32,991
Danny, what are you fellows
doing here, anyway?

1035
01:20:33,071 --> 01:20:34,081
Get up

1036
01:20:34,661 --> 01:20:37,340
Loretta, I didn't expect to find you here

1037
01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:39,220
Evening, Rose

1038
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:43,930
Looks like they messed up
your rose garden a little here, Gus

1039
01:20:44,330 --> 01:20:46,220
Somebody owes you an apology

1040
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:57,060
How about you folks all going home now?

1041
01:20:57,310 --> 01:20:59,190
I think this'll do for tonight

1042
01:21:04,599 --> 01:21:06,569
Good evening, Mrs. Albrecht

1043
01:21:07,269 --> 01:21:08,659
-May I?
Come in

1044
01:21:13,779 --> 01:21:16,709
This place will be fixed up
just like it was before.

1045
01:21:16,779 --> 01:21:19,919
-I'm gonna see to it.
-Ja. He will see to it

1046
01:21:28,248 --> 01:21:29,588
Where were you?

1047
01:21:32,418 --> 01:21:34,258
Where did you get his coat?

1048
01:21:45,898 --> 01:21:47,148
You all right?

1049
01:21:48,768 --> 01:21:52,487
You had to start slugging, didn't you?
Were you showing off for her?

1050
01:21:52,897 --> 01:21:54,657
You had to start slugging

1051
01:21:55,237 --> 01:21:58,287
I was trying to help you
-I don't need your help.

1052
01:21:59,327 --> 01:22:02,747
If you want to slug people,
do it for yourself and not for me

1053
01:22:02,827 --> 01:22:06,967
And don't lie to me about trying to
-Aron, I tried to help you!

1054
01:22:11,877 --> 01:22:15,467
Great big Aron
-You finished?

1055
01:22:16,836 --> 01:22:21,016
-No!
Cal, stop it! Don't

1056
01:22:21,096 --> 01:22:22,346
-Don't.
Don't do that

1057
01:22:22,426 --> 01:22:24,936
-Don't.
Abra, don't do that!

1058
01:22:34,396 --> 01:22:35,526
Wait here

1059
01:23:14,974 --> 01:23:16,734
I was trying to help him

1060
01:23:19,854 --> 01:23:21,944
Who am I kidding?

1061
01:23:22,574 --> 01:23:24,374
I tried to kill him

1062
01:23:26,864 --> 01:23:28,454
Mike, give me a drink

1063
01:23:31,374 --> 01:23:33,043
Don't drink any more
-Why?

1064
01:23:33,123 --> 01:23:36,173
No, please. it's not good for you
-it's good for me.

1065
01:23:36,503 --> 01:23:40,763
No, you're gonna get drunk
-Yeah, I'm gonna get drunk.

1066
01:23:42,463 --> 01:23:45,723
Please forget it, what happened up
on the ferris wheel.

1067
01:23:46,053 --> 01:23:48,383
It didn't mean anything, really

1068
01:23:48,553 --> 01:23:51,053
Please, forget it. It didn't mean anything

1069
01:23:52,353 --> 01:23:54,563
Say it didn't. Please, say it didn't

1070
01:23:57,432 --> 01:24:01,992
Someday he's gonna know
who his real son is.

1071
01:24:03,062 --> 01:24:04,072
What?

1072
01:24:05,902 --> 01:24:07,662
Someday he's gonna know

1073
01:24:11,072 --> 01:24:13,332
I don't understand you. You scare me

1074
01:24:16,742 --> 01:24:19,712
I know. I scare myself
-Abra.

1075
01:24:39,681 --> 01:24:41,441
Fix me another drink

1076
01:24:47,730 --> 01:24:51,990
I want that money. Now you give it to me
-You know I haven't any money here.

1077
01:24:55,950 --> 01:24:56,960
Okay

1078
01:24:57,740 --> 01:25:00,590
-When will you get it?
In the morning, I suppose

1079
01:25:01,790 --> 01:25:04,340
Okay. I'll sleep here

1080
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:09,020
Come on. You've gotta go home

1081
01:25:09,090 --> 01:25:11,310
If you still feel the same way
in the morning...

1082
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:13,189
you come back, we'll go to the bank

1083
01:25:13,259 --> 01:25:16,019
and I'll see that you get everything
that's coming to you.

1084
01:25:16,099 --> 01:25:19,609
I'll buy out your share.
I'll go on and make a fortune with it

1085
01:25:20,599 --> 01:25:25,069
Okay. That seems fair to me, Will

1086
01:25:51,628 --> 01:25:52,638
Abra

1087
01:25:56,178 --> 01:25:57,518
What?

1088
01:25:58,968 --> 01:26:00,308
Who is it?
-Cal.

1089
01:26:02,637 --> 01:26:03,767
-Cal?
Yeah

1090
01:26:05,347 --> 01:26:08,397
What on earth are you doing here?
-I want to see you.

1091
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:11,617
Wait till I put something on

1092
01:26:29,996 --> 01:26:33,096
I gotta tell you something
Can you keep a secret?

1093
01:26:33,626 --> 01:26:35,796
Yes. What is it?

1094
01:26:37,126 --> 01:26:39,816
What's the matter? You look terrible

1095
01:26:43,136 --> 01:26:45,396
I got it
-What?

1096
01:26:48,346 --> 01:26:51,816
Remember that money? Dad lost?

1097
01:26:51,896 --> 01:26:53,655
On that lettuce business?

1098
01:26:56,445 --> 01:27:00,115
-I got it.
You mean you earned it all back?

1099
01:27:00,195 --> 01:27:02,995
I've earned every cent
-That's wonderful, Cal.

1100
01:27:07,115 --> 01:27:10,635
You got any time off tomorrow
from the hospital?

1101
01:27:12,335 --> 01:27:14,585
I get an hour at lunchtime. Why?

1102
01:27:15,415 --> 01:27:17,135
Thursday's Dad's birthday

1103
01:27:20,254 --> 01:27:22,424
And I'm gonna give a party for him

1104
01:27:25,464 --> 01:27:30,394
And I Want you and me
you and Aron and me...

1105
01:27:31,434 --> 01:27:32,944
to be there

1106
01:27:35,184 --> 01:27:38,784
I'm gonna give him that money
just like it was a birthday present

1107
01:27:39,314 --> 01:27:42,084
You could come
and help me get some junk

1108
01:27:42,154 --> 01:27:45,003
and we could decorate the house
-Sure.

1109
01:27:46,323 --> 01:27:48,743
And we'll get balloons

1110
01:27:51,453 --> 01:27:55,633
and all that kid stuff, birthday stuff
-We can go to the five and 10.

1111
01:27:58,213 --> 01:28:00,593
Will you do it?
-I'd like to.

1112
01:28:17,392 --> 01:28:20,112
I'm sort of

1113
01:28:27,742 --> 01:28:29,212
Why did I hit Aron?

1114
01:28:31,862 --> 01:28:34,171
Why did I hit him so hard?

1115
01:28:45,541 --> 01:28:48,181
Will you help me?

1116
01:28:48,261 --> 01:28:50,591
Will you really help me?

1117
01:28:52,841 --> 01:28:54,351
I'll help you, Cal

1118
01:28:59,350 --> 01:29:00,480
Be careful

1119
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:06,530
How'd I get up here?

1120
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:21,130
Is your father coming?
-Yeah.

1121
01:29:21,210 --> 01:29:24,249
-Cal, don't get nervous.
I think it looks beautiful

1122
01:29:24,749 --> 01:29:26,589
Don't you? I love the way it looks

1123
01:29:26,669 --> 01:29:28,919
It looks festive, doesn't it?
-Yes, it does.

1124
01:29:28,999 --> 01:29:30,679
Yes, Cal, it looks very pretty

1125
01:29:30,759 --> 01:29:33,179
Do you think this is childish?
-Not a bit.

1126
01:29:33,259 --> 01:29:36,309
The room looks lovely.
Your father's going to love it

1127
01:29:37,349 --> 01:29:39,599
How's the turkey?
it's a good turkey.

1128
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:41,849
Smells ready
-it'll be ready.

1129
01:29:41,929 --> 01:29:45,279
Aron didn't get him anything?
He told me he had something.

1130
01:29:53,988 --> 01:29:56,748
-What?
He didn't tell me what it was

1131
01:30:04,708 --> 01:30:07,388
It won't stack up against mine, will it?
-No.

1132
01:30:07,958 --> 01:30:09,678
Do you wanna see mine?
-I'd like to.

1133
01:30:09,748 --> 01:30:11,388
I got it wrapped up
-Show it to me.

1134
01:30:11,458 --> 01:30:12,508
Wanna see it?
-Yes.

1135
01:30:12,588 --> 01:30:13,678
Okay

1136
01:30:15,887 --> 01:30:17,307
You like it?
-it's pretty.

1137
01:30:17,387 --> 01:30:18,977
You think it's pretty?

1138
01:30:20,677 --> 01:30:22,437
Don't drink any more wine

1139
01:30:26,017 --> 01:30:29,027
Did Aron tell you what the present was?
-No.

1140
01:30:30,267 --> 01:30:33,157
-You sure?
Honestly, he didn't

1141
01:30:33,857 --> 01:30:36,357
I'd tell you if he did. Honestly, I would

1142
01:30:37,527 --> 01:30:40,996
Now everything's gonna go off fine. Here

1143
01:30:42,696 --> 01:30:44,126
The brooms

1144
01:30:44,536 --> 01:30:47,116
Don't you do anything to give me away
-I wouldn't.

1145
01:30:47,206 --> 01:30:49,926
We'll let him come in
and let the house speak for itself

1146
01:30:49,996 --> 01:30:54,056
We'll act like it was any other old day
-Yes. Wait, Cal.

1147
01:30:56,586 --> 01:30:57,846
Cal

1148
01:31:02,596 --> 01:31:04,346
You look wonderful

1149
01:31:06,015 --> 01:31:07,025
Thanks

1150
01:31:17,275 --> 01:31:18,825
But I need my son

1151
01:31:18,905 --> 01:31:22,085
It isn't that he doesn't want
to fight for his country. He does

1152
01:31:22,155 --> 01:31:23,495
I need him to work the farm

1153
01:31:23,575 --> 01:31:25,995
Things can't be as bad as you say
Mr. Piscora.

1154
01:31:26,075 --> 01:31:28,575
You must be making plenty of money
out of your crops.

1155
01:31:28,665 --> 01:31:32,174
No money. I sold this year's crop
for 5 cents before I even planted it

1156
01:31:32,244 --> 01:31:33,504
Everything cost so much now

1157
01:31:33,584 --> 01:31:36,264
And now I got to sell next year crop
Sol need my boy.

1158
01:31:36,334 --> 01:31:38,344
I can do nothing about it, Mr. Piscora

1159
01:31:38,424 --> 01:31:40,884
In all conscience,
I cannot excuse your son

1160
01:31:40,964 --> 01:31:44,014
Come on, Poppa
-I don't like it.

1161
01:31:44,674 --> 01:31:47,474
I'm telling you. I don't like it

1162
01:31:51,974 --> 01:31:54,024
Hello, Abra. Nice to see you

1163
01:31:54,104 --> 01:31:57,363
-Gonna stay to dinner?
Yes, I am. Is something the matter?

1164
01:31:57,433 --> 01:32:01,363
No, nothing. I guess I shouldn't
have taken that job in the Draft Board

1165
01:32:02,063 --> 01:32:04,993
Did you notice the snow on Mount Toro?
-Yes, I saw it.

1166
01:32:05,073 --> 01:32:07,403
Say, that means we got
a good year coming in.

1167
01:32:07,493 --> 01:32:11,003
We could use it
-Let's go in.

1168
01:32:31,722 --> 01:32:34,192
-Happy birthday, Dad.
Happy birthday, Mr. Trask

1169
01:32:34,262 --> 01:32:36,812
Is it possible? I'm very touched

1170
01:32:36,892 --> 01:32:40,242
-Are you surprised?
I had no idea. I'd forgotten completely

1171
01:32:40,312 --> 01:32:44,112
-We knew you had, didn't we?
Completely. I don't know what to say

1172
01:32:48,031 --> 01:32:49,661
We got turkey

1173
01:32:49,741 --> 01:32:53,331
-And champagne.
Champagne, and we got all the things

1174
01:32:56,201 --> 01:32:58,881
We got the trimmings here
-isn't that pretty?

1175
01:33:03,921 --> 01:33:07,101
Got something for you

1176
01:33:07,171 --> 01:33:10,181
Presents, too. isn't that nice. Look

1177
01:33:15,140 --> 01:33:17,520
Ain't you gonna open it up?
-Yes.

1178
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:21,990
Dad, Abra and I have one for you, too
only we can't exactly give it to you.

1179
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:27,230
I didn't tell Abra I was going to do this
but we're engaged.

1180
01:33:30,610 --> 01:33:33,620
I couldn't have wished for anything nicer

1181
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:38,079
A lovely birthday present

1182
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:41,629
You have my blessings
-Thank you, Dad.

1183
01:33:42,959 --> 01:33:45,669
But you haven't opened Cal's present yet
-No.

1184
01:33:47,919 --> 01:33:50,969
But I can't imagine having
anything better than this.

1185
01:33:52,129 --> 01:33:53,219
Excuse me

1186
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:58,979
Course I suspected it right along
But, Cal, coming on my birthday.

1187
01:34:03,268 --> 01:34:04,438
What's this?

1188
01:34:06,518 --> 01:34:07,988
What is this?

1189
01:34:11,148 --> 01:34:15,488
I made it. And it's for you.
it's all the money you lost on the lettuce

1190
01:34:15,568 --> 01:34:17,868
You made it? But how?

1191
01:34:20,158 --> 01:34:21,198
Go on

1192
01:34:22,748 --> 01:34:24,088
-Beans
Beans?

1193
01:34:25,748 --> 01:34:29,007
Yes, we bought futures at 5 cents

1194
01:34:29,667 --> 01:34:34,507
and the war came along
and the price Went sky-high

1195
01:34:35,837 --> 01:34:39,187
So, that's for you

1196
01:34:40,427 --> 01:34:43,357
it's all the money you lost
in the lettuce business.

1197
01:34:44,637 --> 01:34:45,937
It's for you

1198
01:34:47,937 --> 01:34:50,817
-I made it for you.
You will have to give it back

1199
01:34:53,316 --> 01:34:58,206
No, I made it for you, Dad
I want you to have it.

1200
01:34:58,906 --> 01:35:02,206
You will have to give it back
-Who? I can't give it--

1201
01:35:02,286 --> 01:35:05,996
-To the people you got it from.
No, the British Purchasing Agency?

1202
01:35:06,076 --> 01:35:08,876
-I can't give it back.
Give it to the farmers you robbed

1203
01:35:08,956 --> 01:35:10,546
We didn't rob anybody, Dad

1204
01:35:10,626 --> 01:35:14,466
We paid 2 cents a pound,
2 cents over market for that stuff

1205
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:18,885
I sign my name
and boys go out and some die

1206
01:35:19,425 --> 01:35:21,675
and some live helpless
without arms and legs.

1207
01:35:21,755 --> 01:35:23,685
Not one will come back untorn

1208
01:35:24,305 --> 01:35:27,185
Do you think I could take
a profit from that?

1209
01:35:29,855 --> 01:35:32,565
I don't want the money, Cal!
I couldn't take it!

1210
01:35:33,145 --> 01:35:35,995
I thank you for the thought, but
-I'll keep it for you.

1211
01:35:36,065 --> 01:35:38,945
I'll wrap it up
and we'll just keep it in here

1212
01:35:39,025 --> 01:35:40,445
I'll never take it!

1213
01:35:40,525 --> 01:35:43,874
Son, I'd be happy if you'd give me

1214
01:35:43,944 --> 01:35:47,044
something like your brother's given me

1215
01:35:47,114 --> 01:35:51,074
Something honest and human and good
Don't be angry, Son.

1216
01:35:51,914 --> 01:35:54,924
If you want to give me a present
give me a good life.

1217
01:35:55,044 --> 01:35:57,044
That's something I could value

1218
01:36:25,903 --> 01:36:27,323
I hate you!

1219
01:36:45,382 --> 01:36:47,142
What are you doing?

1220
01:36:53,512 --> 01:36:55,772
He doesn't want anything from me

1221
01:36:56,182 --> 01:36:57,471
Cal, don't

1222
01:37:00,191 --> 01:37:01,401
Please, don't

1223
01:37:10,571 --> 01:37:11,581
Abra!

1224
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:35,310
Don't you ever touch her again

1225
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:39,440
I don't trust you

1226
01:37:42,310 --> 01:37:43,600
You're no good

1227
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:48,659
You're mean and vicious and wild
And you always have been.

1228
01:37:49,029 --> 01:37:50,869
You know it, too, don't you?

1229
01:37:51,239 --> 01:37:53,739
Father and I have put up
with every vicious thing..

1230
01:37:53,819 --> 01:37:57,999
You could think of since you were a child
And we've always forgiven you.

1231
01:37:58,579 --> 01:38:00,959
But now I don't want you to go near Abra

1232
01:38:01,039 --> 01:38:04,299
I don't want you to talk with her
Just stay away from her!

1233
01:38:32,068 --> 01:38:34,918
You want to go some place with me?
-Why should I?

1234
01:38:38,237 --> 01:38:40,077
I got something to show you

1235
01:38:41,617 --> 01:38:45,417
Think you'll find it very interesting
-What are you talking about?

1236
01:38:46,537 --> 01:38:49,887
Maybe our mother didn't die
and go to heaven after all, Aron

1237
01:38:50,587 --> 01:38:53,547
What do you mean by that?
-Maybe she didn't.

1238
01:38:53,627 --> 01:38:55,517
Maybe she's alive someplace

1239
01:38:57,637 --> 01:38:59,307
What are you up to now?

1240
01:38:59,387 --> 01:39:02,976
Remember when we were kids,
we used to make up stories about her?

1241
01:39:03,596 --> 01:39:08,316
You said she must have looked
like heaven's youngest angel, remember?

1242
01:39:09,556 --> 01:39:11,866
Remember that time I shot that rabbit?

1243
01:39:12,566 --> 01:39:14,536
You cried and you said

1244
01:39:14,646 --> 01:39:17,786
that she would have cried, too,
cause she was so tenderhearted

1245
01:39:17,856 --> 01:39:20,706
And you said I was bad
you remember that?

1246
01:39:21,696 --> 01:39:25,206
I just want to show you something
it's not gonna take very long.

1247
01:39:25,286 --> 01:39:26,626
What's the matter, you afraid?

1248
01:39:26,706 --> 01:39:29,175
I'm not afraid to look at anything
you could show me.

1249
01:39:29,245 --> 01:39:33,385
Can you look at the truth, just once?

1250
01:39:35,795 --> 01:39:40,305
Come on, you can look
at the truth just once. Can't you?

1251
01:39:41,845 --> 01:39:42,855
Come on

1252
01:39:44,595 --> 01:39:47,645
I want to show you something
It won't take very long.

1253
01:40:22,793 --> 01:40:24,013
Oh, Cal

1254
01:40:26,213 --> 01:40:27,223
Hello

1255
01:40:51,702 --> 01:40:56,252
Mother, this is your other son, Aron

1256
01:40:58,412 --> 01:41:00,752
Aron is everything that's good, Mother

1257
01:41:09,671 --> 01:41:11,601
Say hello to your mother

1258
01:41:26,321 --> 01:41:28,321
Say hello to your mother, Aron!

1259
01:41:29,441 --> 01:41:31,831
Joe!

1260
01:41:43,830 --> 01:41:45,840
Play another song!
-Quiet!

1261
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:49,470
Five!

1262
01:41:49,970 --> 01:41:53,810
"I'm thinking of the lilac trees
that shook their purple plumes

1263
01:41:54,930 --> 01:41:58,190
"I'm thinking of the rivulet
with its cool and silvery flow

1264
01:41:58,770 --> 01:42:02,779
Of the old gray rock that shadowed it
and the peppermint below"

1265
01:42:08,609 --> 01:42:12,039
-Where is Aron?
I don't know. I'm not my brother's keeper

1266
01:42:12,109 --> 01:42:13,779
Where did you go?
-For a ride.

1267
01:42:13,859 --> 01:42:16,079
What did you quarrel about?
-You.

1268
01:42:16,409 --> 01:42:19,259
You're angry about the money
-No, I'm not angry.

1269
01:42:19,579 --> 01:42:21,499
I like it. I think it's great

1270
01:42:22,249 --> 01:42:24,378
I'm gonna go away
and take that money with me

1271
01:42:24,458 --> 01:42:28,008
I think I'll start me a little business
Just like my mother did.

1272
01:42:28,088 --> 01:42:32,228
What do you know about your mother?
-I know where she is and what she is.

1273
01:42:32,298 --> 01:42:35,148
And I know why she left you
Couldn't stand it.

1274
01:42:35,678 --> 01:42:38,528
You didn't really love her
any more than you do me

1275
01:42:39,218 --> 01:42:41,768
Because of your goodness, your rightness

1276
01:42:41,848 --> 01:42:44,608
You never gave either one of us
an inch, ever...

1277
01:42:44,688 --> 01:42:46,528
from what you thought was right

1278
01:42:46,608 --> 01:42:50,527
You kept on forgiving us,
but you never really loved us

1279
01:42:51,357 --> 01:42:53,447
I know why you didn't love me

1280
01:42:53,527 --> 01:42:54,997
Because I'm like my mother

1281
01:42:55,067 --> 01:42:58,037
and you never forgave yourself
for having loved her.

1282
01:43:00,197 --> 01:43:04,207
I'm not gonna forgive him.
I'm never gonna forgive him

1283
01:43:04,287 --> 01:43:08,877
-Where is Aron?
He's with her, with his mother

1284
01:43:09,747 --> 01:43:12,257
She's over there in Monterey
if you want to know.

1285
01:43:12,337 --> 01:43:14,177
She owns one of them houses

1286
01:43:15,626 --> 01:43:18,346
I took Aron there tonight
because I was jealous.

1287
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:23,606
I've been jealous all my life.
Jealous, I couldn't even stand it

1288
01:43:28,096 --> 01:43:30,486
Tonight, I even tried to buy your love

1289
01:43:32,606 --> 01:43:34,656
But now I don't want it anymore

1290
01:43:37,316 --> 01:43:41,075
-I can't use it anymore.
Don't talk to your father like that

1291
01:43:44,865 --> 01:43:47,165
I don't want any kind of love anymore

1292
01:43:49,075 --> 01:43:50,585
It doesn't pay off

1293
01:43:51,125 --> 01:43:52,965
No future in it

1294
01:43:55,465 --> 01:43:57,215
Let him go if he wants to

1295
01:44:02,255 --> 01:44:04,095
No, I won't

1296
01:44:16,944 --> 01:44:18,774
You hate me, too, don't you?

1297
01:44:20,274 --> 01:44:21,704
I'm afraid of you

1298
01:44:26,784 --> 01:44:30,413
What you did to Aron tonight,
I don't know what it will do to him

1299
01:44:32,993 --> 01:44:35,583
I feel like I'm to blame, too

1300
01:44:37,123 --> 01:44:42,093
-Adam!
Here. What is it?

1301
01:44:42,173 --> 01:44:45,183
Drunk and had a couple of fights
He's gone kind of crazy.

1302
01:44:45,263 --> 01:44:48,193
He's at the station now.
Wait, I'll drive you down in my car

1303
01:44:48,263 --> 01:44:49,353
Cal!

1304
01:44:56,102 --> 01:44:58,822
What happened between you and Aron?
-Why?

1305
01:44:58,892 --> 01:45:02,072
He's gone kind of crazy.
He's drunk and had a couple of fights

1306
01:45:02,152 --> 01:45:04,372
and seemed determined
to get himself hurt.

1307
01:45:04,442 --> 01:45:06,452
He's leaving on that troop train tonight

1308
01:45:06,532 --> 01:45:09,032
and says he's gonna enlist tomorrow
at King City.

1309
01:45:09,112 --> 01:45:12,712
Adam's on his way down there now
to talk to him before the train leaves

1310
01:45:12,782 --> 01:45:15,202
I think you better get down there

1311
01:45:16,332 --> 01:45:18,212
-Yeah.
My car's downstairs

1312
01:46:17,349 --> 01:46:19,649
Do you know what a stroke is, exactly?

1313
01:46:23,979 --> 01:46:27,159
This one is a leakage of blood in the brain
caused by shock.

1314
01:46:27,229 --> 01:46:29,399
There have been earlier, smaller leakages

1315
01:46:29,489 --> 01:46:32,499
The left side is paralyzed
and the right side partly.

1316
01:46:33,109 --> 01:46:35,828
In other words,
your father is nearly helpless

1317
01:46:37,028 --> 01:46:40,208
-Will he die?
He might live a week or a year

1318
01:46:40,998 --> 01:46:42,588
He might die tonight

1319
01:46:49,548 --> 01:46:52,928
-Will he know me?
You'll have to find that out for yourself

1320
01:46:57,598 --> 01:46:59,068
Good day

1321
01:47:01,137 --> 01:47:04,597
Good day, Doctor. Good day, Sam

1322
01:47:06,597 --> 01:47:09,527
Cain rose up against his brother Abel
and slew him.

1323
01:47:10,067 --> 01:47:14,207
"And Cain went away and dwelt
in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden

1324
01:47:16,277 --> 01:47:18,917
Now why don't you go away some place?

1325
01:47:33,296 --> 01:47:36,306
He's right
-No.

1326
01:47:38,256 --> 01:47:40,806
Yes, he is. He's right. That's what I'll do

1327
01:47:50,856 --> 01:47:53,105
Who's gonna wash these things for me?

1328
01:47:54,985 --> 01:47:56,105
Thank you

1329
01:47:58,445 --> 01:48:00,415
There you are
-How is he?

1330
01:48:00,485 --> 01:48:03,455
He's fine. He's my darling

1331
01:48:03,535 --> 01:48:05,415
Washed his face, combed his hair

1332
01:48:05,495 --> 01:48:07,085
Can I go in there now?

1333
01:48:07,535 --> 01:48:11,045
Just for a minute. I want him to rest
Gotta get lots of sleep.

1334
01:48:12,995 --> 01:48:16,794
-How is he, really?
Haven't I seen you at the hospital?

1335
01:48:17,544 --> 01:48:19,714
Not part of the family, are you?
-No.

1336
01:48:19,794 --> 01:48:21,184
I didn't think so

1337
01:48:21,254 --> 01:48:24,524
I can tell you,
I won't have this job for long

1338
01:48:24,594 --> 01:48:28,814
That's my luck. Always seem to get them
when they're old and ready to die off.

1339
01:48:43,533 --> 01:48:47,583
Now doesn't he look nice?
He's going to be a darling patient

1340
01:48:48,243 --> 01:48:50,963
Even tried to smile at me
didn't you, my dear?

1341
01:48:51,783 --> 01:48:54,083
I don't want you to tire my patient
-Please go.

1342
01:48:54,163 --> 01:48:57,263
Now listen, miss,
don't you try to order me about

1343
01:48:57,963 --> 01:48:59,883
I'll report you to the doctor

1344
01:49:00,213 --> 01:49:02,843
Will you go out of the room
and shut the door?

1345
01:49:38,331 --> 01:49:39,341
Father

1346
01:49:42,751 --> 01:49:44,091
Can you hear me?

1347
01:49:49,841 --> 01:49:51,561
I did an awful thing

1348
01:49:55,721 --> 01:49:56,811
I'm sorry

1349
01:50:31,509 --> 01:50:33,599
Mr. Trask, can you hear me?

1350
01:50:34,679 --> 01:50:37,439
Is it just Cal you won't answer?

1351
01:50:38,009 --> 01:50:39,439
Can you answer?

1352
01:50:41,679 --> 01:50:43,989
I think you can understand me, though

1353
01:50:44,849 --> 01:50:48,568
I think behind your eyes
you're just as alert as ever

1354
01:50:49,688 --> 01:50:52,788
You understand everything I say
only you can't show it.

1355
01:51:00,408 --> 01:51:04,258
Excuse me, Mr. Trask,
for daring to speak to you this way

1356
01:51:04,668 --> 01:51:08,928
but it's awful not to beloved.
it's the worst thing in the world

1357
01:51:11,128 --> 01:51:13,677
Don't ask me how I know that
I just know it.

1358
01:51:14,007 --> 01:51:17,717
It makes you mean and violent and cruel

1359
01:51:17,797 --> 01:51:20,687
And that's the way
Cal has always felt, all his life

1360
01:51:22,017 --> 01:51:25,147
I know you didn't mean it to be that way
but it's true.

1361
01:51:26,937 --> 01:51:31,697
You never gave him your love
You never asked him for his.

1362
01:51:32,937 --> 01:51:35,077
You never asked him for one thing

1363
01:51:36,197 --> 01:51:39,956
Cal is going away, Mr. Trask
But before he goes ....

1364
01:51:42,246 --> 01:51:46,256
He did something very bad,
and I'm not asking you to forgive him

1365
01:51:46,706 --> 01:51:49,586
You have to give him some sign
that you love him...

1366
01:51:49,916 --> 01:51:51,836
or else he'll never be a man

1367
01:51:52,546 --> 01:51:56,806
He'll just keep on feeling guilty
and alone, unless you release him

1368
01:51:58,426 --> 01:51:59,816
Please, help him

1369
01:52:00,346 --> 01:52:04,055
I love Cal, Mr. Trask,
and I want him to be whole and strong

1370
01:52:04,135 --> 01:52:06,775
and you're the only one who can do it

1371
01:52:06,845 --> 01:52:08,735
So try, please try

1372
01:52:10,685 --> 01:52:13,895
If you could ask him for something

1373
01:52:14,685 --> 01:52:17,615
Let him help you so that he knows
that you love him.

1374
01:52:18,525 --> 01:52:20,195
Let him do for you

1375
01:52:23,655 --> 01:52:28,584
Excuse me, Mr. Trask, for daring
to speak to you this way, but I just had to

1376
01:52:34,334 --> 01:52:35,464
You've tired my patient

1377
01:52:35,544 --> 01:52:39,134
and I most certainly shall report it
to the doctor in the morning.

1378
01:52:41,424 --> 01:52:45,354
You don't know that he accuses you.
You don't know what he's thinking about

1379
01:52:45,634 --> 01:52:48,404
Stop it, Cal.
You gonna cry for the rest of your life?

1380
01:52:48,474 --> 01:52:50,024
-No.
Then stop it

1381
01:52:50,804 --> 01:52:53,943
Goin' there and talk to him
before it's too late.

1382
01:52:54,023 --> 01:52:56,903
-I can't.
Please try

1383
01:52:57,603 --> 01:52:58,943
Get it straight

1384
01:52:59,983 --> 01:53:04,123
Get through to him, somehow.
Please try, Cal, before it's too late

1385
01:53:10,783 --> 01:53:14,713
Is there any coffee around here?
-I'll get you some in a minute.

1386
01:53:20,502 --> 01:53:21,542
Try

1387
01:53:22,882 --> 01:53:25,182
Is there anything to read around here?

1388
01:53:26,672 --> 01:53:28,182
What would you like?

1389
01:53:28,262 --> 01:53:32,272
Something to get my mind off my feet
-There's something in there.

1390
01:53:47,401 --> 01:53:51,161
I tried to believe it was born in me

1391
01:53:51,241 --> 01:53:55,001
and that I couldn't help it
but that's not so.

1392
01:53:57,371 --> 01:53:58,841
A man has a choice

1393
01:53:59,081 --> 01:54:02,181
You used to say that was where
he was different from an animal.

1394
01:54:02,251 --> 01:54:03,841
You see, I remember

1395
01:54:03,921 --> 01:54:07,631
A man has a choice,
and the choice is what makes him a man

1396
01:54:09,970 --> 01:54:11,600
You see, I do remember

1397
01:54:12,050 --> 01:54:15,760
Look, I can't find any coffee
-Get out!

1398
01:54:26,610 --> 01:54:27,620
Look

1399
01:54:35,949 --> 01:54:39,209
Do something

1400
01:54:41,409 --> 01:54:42,619
for me

1401
01:54:42,709 --> 01:54:43,999
Yes

1402
01:54:48,129 --> 01:54:51,179
That woman

1403
01:54:51,799 --> 01:54:56,139
the nurse, can't stand her

1404
01:54:58,349 --> 01:55:00,018
Get me another

1405
01:55:15,868 --> 01:55:17,918
I can't stand her, either

1406
01:56:10,286 --> 01:56:11,676
What did he say?

1407
01:56:18,385 --> 01:56:21,815
He said, "Don't get anybody else

1408
01:56:23,345 --> 01:56:25,895
He said, "You stay with me

1409
01:56:27,265 --> 01:56:29,025
and you take care of me
