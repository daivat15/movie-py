1
00:00:58,502 --> 00:01:02,506
'Twas a long time ago,
longer now than it seems...

2
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,468
in a place that perhaps
you've seen in your dreams.

3
00:01:05,557 --> 00:01:08,262
For the story that you
are about to be told...

4
00:01:08,346 --> 00:01:11,349
took place
in the holiday worlds of old.

5
00:01:11,432 --> 00:01:14,852
Now, you've probably wondered
where holidays come from.

6
00:01:14,936 --> 00:01:19,065
If you haven't,
I'd say it's time you begun!

7
00:01:34,413 --> 00:01:37,208
<i>Boys and girls
of every age</i>

8
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:40,044
<i>Wouldn't you like to see
something strange</i>

9
00:01:40,127 --> 00:01:42,922
<i>Come with us
and you will see</i>

10
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:45,758
<i>This our town
of Halloween</i>

11
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:48,636
<i>This is Halloween
This is Halloween</i>

12
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,514
<i>Pumpkins scream
in the dead of night</i>

13
00:01:51,597 --> 00:01:54,392
<i>This is Halloween
Everybody make a scene</i>

14
00:01:54,475 --> 00:01:57,311
<i>Trick-or-treat till the
neighbor's gonna die of fright</i>

Everybody scream</i>

<i>Teeth ground sharp
and eyes glowing red</i>

19

<i>I am the one hiding
under your stairs</i>

20

Don't we love it now</i>

26
00:02:29,927 --> 00:02:32,722
<i>Everybody's waiting
for the next surprise</i>

27
00:02:32,805 --> 00:02:35,516
<i>'Round that corner, man
Hiding in the trash can</i>

28
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,061
<i>- Something's waiting now to pounce and how you'll
- Scream</i>

29
00:02:39,145 --> 00:02:41,397
<i>- This is Halloween - Red
and black - And slimy green</i>

30
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,150
<i>- Aren't you scared
- Well, that's just fine</i>

31
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:47,111
<i>Say it once, say it twice
Take a chance and roll the dice</i>

32
00:02:47,194 --> 00:02:49,947
<i>Ride with the moon
in the dead of night</i>

Everybody scream</i>

<i>Here in a flash
and gone without a trace</i>

37

<i>I am the who
when you call who's there</i>

00:03:03,753 --> 00:03:06,547
<i>I am the wind blowing
through your hair</i>

39
00:03:06,631 --> 00:03:09,342
<i>I am the shadow
on the moon at night</i>

00:03:09,425 --> 00:03:12,178
<i>Filling your dreams
to the brim with fright</i>

<i>Life's no fun
without a good scare</i>

49
00:03:38,245 --> 00:03:40,706
<i>Skeleton Jack
might catch you in the back</i>

50
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:44,168
<i>And scream like a banshee
Make you jump out of your skin</i>

<i>This is Halloween
Everybody scream</i>

52
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:49,632
<i>Won't you please make way
for a very special guy</i>

53
00:03:49,715 --> 00:03:52,510
<i>Our man Jack is king

<i>Everyone hail
to the Pumpkin King now</i>

<i>La, la, la, la, la, la
Whee</i>

61
00:04:32,216 --> 00:04:35,261
- It's over!
- We did it!

62
00:04:35,344 --> 00:04:38,848
- Wasn't it terrifying?
- What a night!

63
00:04:38,931 --> 00:04:41,142
Great Halloween, everybody.

64
00:04:41,225 --> 00:04:45,771
I believe it was our most horrible yet.
Thank you, everyone.

65
00:04:45,855 --> 00:04:47,815
No! Thanks to you, Jack.

66
00:04:47,898 --> 00:04:49,942
Without your
brilliant leadership...

67
00:04:50,026 --> 00:04:53,946
- Not at all, Mayor.
- You're such a scream, Jack.

68
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:58,993
- You're a witch's fondest dream.
- You made walls fall, Jack.

69
00:04:59,076 --> 00:05:03,456
Walls fall? You made
the very mountains crack, Jack.

70
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:08,586
- The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally.
- Let go!

71
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:13,299
- You're not ready for so much excitement.
- Yes, I am!

72
00:05:13,382 --> 00:05:16,510
- You're coming with me!
- No, I'm not!

73
00:05:20,222 --> 00:05:23,059
Come back here, you foolish...

74
00:05:23,142 --> 00:05:25,645
Oh! Oh! Oh-oh-oh.

75
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:30,483
Ooh, Jack, you made
wounds ooze and flesh crawl.

76
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:34,612
Thank you. Thank you!
Thank you very much!

77
00:05:34,695 --> 00:05:39,700
<i>Hold it. We haven't given out
the prizes yet.</i>

78
00:05:39,784 --> 00:05:42,662
Our first award
goes to the vampires...

79
00:05:42,745 --> 00:05:45,539
for most blood drained
in a single evening.

80
00:05:46,832 --> 00:05:48,876
<i>Our second and
honorable mention...</i>

81
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,713
<i>goes to the fabulous
Dark Lagoon leeches.</i>

82
00:05:59,637 --> 00:06:02,556
Nice work, Bone Daddy.

83
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,851
Yeah, I guess so.
Just like last year...

84
00:06:05,935 --> 00:06:08,854
and the year before that,
and the year before that.

85
00:06:49,437 --> 00:06:53,691
<i>There are few who deny
at what I do I am the best</i>

86
00:06:53,774 --> 00:06:57,987
<i>For my talents
are renowned far and wide</i>

87
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:02,408
<i>When it comes to surprises
in the moonlit night</i>

88
00:07:02,491 --> 00:07:06,579
<i>I excel without ever even trying</i>

89
00:07:06,662 --> 00:07:08,873
<i>With the slightest little effort</i>

90
00:07:08,956 --> 00:07:11,167
<i>Of my ghost-like charms</i>

91
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,379
<i>I have seen grown men
give out a shriek</i>

92
00:07:15,463 --> 00:07:19,925
<i>With a wave of my hand
and a well-placed moan</i>

93
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:24,263
<i>I have swept the very bravest
off their feet</i>

94
00:07:24,347 --> 00:07:27,183
<i>Yet year after year</i>

95
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:29,852
<i>It's the same routine</i>

96
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:34,857
<i>And I grow so weary
of the sound of screams</i>

97
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:39,820
<i>And I, Jack
the Pumpkin King</i>

98
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:45,409
<i>Have grown so tired
of the same old thing</i>

99
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,290
<i>Oh, somewhere deep</i>

100
00:07:51,374 --> 00:07:54,335
<i>Inside of these bones</i>

101
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:57,421
<i>An emptiness</i>

102
00:07:57,505 --> 00:08:00,424
<i>Began to grow</i>

103
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:04,011
<i>There's something out there</i>

104
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,681
<i>Far from my home</i>

105
00:08:06,764 --> 00:08:10,142
<i>A longing that</i>

106
00:08:10,226 --> 00:08:15,398
<i>I've never known</i>

107
00:08:16,732 --> 00:08:19,068
<i>I'm the master of fright</i>

108
00:08:19,151 --> 00:08:21,070
<i>And a demon of light</i>

109
00:08:21,153 --> 00:08:25,408
<i>And I'll scare you
right out of your pants</i>

110
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:29,912
<i>To a guy in Kentucky
I'm Mr. Unlucky</i>

111
00:08:29,996 --> 00:08:34,125
<i>And I'm known throughout
England and France</i>

112
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:38,462
<i>And since I am dead
I can take off my head</i>

113
00:08:38,546 --> 00:08:42,758
<i>To recite Shakespearean quotations</i>

114
00:08:42,842 --> 00:08:47,388
<i>No animal nor man
can scream like I can</i>

115
00:08:47,471 --> 00:08:51,767
<i>With the fury
of my recitations</i>

116
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:54,562
<i>But who here</i>

117
00:08:54,645 --> 00:08:57,023
<i>Would ever understand</i>

118
00:08:57,106 --> 00:09:02,028
<i>That the Pumpkin King
with the skeleton grin</i>

119
00:09:02,111 --> 00:09:07,199
<i>Would tire of his crown
If they only understood</i>

120
00:09:07,283 --> 00:09:09,535
<i>He'd give it all up</i>

121
00:09:09,619 --> 00:09:14,790
<i>If he only could</i>

122
00:09:14,874 --> 00:09:18,210
<i>Oh, there's an empty</i>

123
00:09:18,294 --> 00:09:20,921
<i>Place in my bones</i>

124
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:24,008
<i>That calls out for</i>

125
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:27,094
<i>Something unknown</i>

126
00:09:27,178 --> 00:09:30,264
<i>The fame and praise</i>

127
00:09:30,348 --> 00:09:33,267
<i>Come year after year</i>

128
00:09:33,351 --> 00:09:37,271
<i>Does nothing for</i>

129
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:43,235
<i>These empty tears</i>

130
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:51,619
Jack.

131
00:09:51,702 --> 00:09:54,580
I know how you feel.

132
00:10:16,018 --> 00:10:18,020
Sally!

133
00:10:20,064 --> 00:10:22,358
You've come back.

134
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:26,195
- I had to.
- For this!

135
00:10:27,238 --> 00:10:32,076
- Yes.
- Shall we, then?

136
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,384
That's twice this month you've slipped
deadly nightshade into my tea and run off.

137
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:51,429
- Three times.
- You're mine, you know!

138
00:10:51,512 --> 00:10:55,850
I made you with my own hands.

139
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:58,644
You can make other creations.

140
00:10:58,728 --> 00:11:01,564
I'm restless. I can't help it.

141
00:11:01,647 --> 00:11:05,192
It's a phase, my dear. It'll pass.

142
00:11:05,276 --> 00:11:08,863
We need to be patient, that's all.

143
00:11:08,946 --> 00:11:11,616
But I don't want to be patient.

144
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:16,912
No, Zero, not now.

145
00:11:16,996 --> 00:11:19,624
I'm not in the mood.

146
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:24,462
All right.

147
00:11:24,545 --> 00:11:26,756
Here you go, boy.

148
00:11:45,775 --> 00:11:48,194
Mornin', gents!

149
00:12:09,465 --> 00:12:12,385
Jack, you home?

150
00:12:19,892 --> 00:12:25,356
Jack, I've got the plans
for next Halloween.

151
00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:29,568
I need to go over them with you
so we can get started.

152
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:32,947
Jack, please! I'm only
an elected official here.

153
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,575
I can't make decisions by myself.

154
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:39,620
Jack, answer me!

155
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,544
- Huh?
- He's not home.

156
00:12:46,627 --> 00:12:49,797
- Where is he?
- He hasn't been home all night.

157
00:13:00,891 --> 00:13:02,935
Where are we?

158
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:11,694
It's someplace new!

159
00:13:18,868 --> 00:13:21,912
What is this?

160
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,834
Whoa-oa-oa!

161
00:14:11,295 --> 00:14:16,008
Whoa!

162
00:14:59,093 --> 00:15:02,013
<i>What's this, what's this
There's color everywhere</i>

163
00:15:02,096 --> 00:15:04,223
<i>What's this
There's white things in the air</i>

164
00:15:04,307 --> 00:15:06,934
<i>What's this, I can't believe my eyes
I must be dreaming</i>

165
00:15:07,018 --> 00:15:09,020
<i>Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair
What's this</i>

166
00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:14,609
<i>What's this, what's this
There's something very wrong</i>

167
00:15:14,692 --> 00:15:17,445
<i>What's this, there's people
singing songs, what's this</i>

168
00:15:17,528 --> 00:15:20,948
<i>The streets are lined with little
creatures laughing Everybody seems so happy</i>

169
00:15:21,032 --> 00:15:24,201
<i>Have I possibly gone daffy
What is this</i>

170
00:15:24,285 --> 00:15:27,246
<i>What's this</i>

171
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,082
<i>There's children throwing snowballs
instead of throwing heads</i>

172
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:33,169
<i>They're busy building toys
and absolutely no one's dead</i>

173
00:15:33,252 --> 00:15:36,213
<i>There's frost in every window
Oh, I can't believe my eyes</i>

174
00:15:36,297 --> 00:15:38,215
<i>And in my bones
I feel the warmth</i>

175
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:42,261
<i>That's coming from inside</i>

176
00:15:42,345 --> 00:15:45,222
<i>Oh, look, what's this
They're hanging mistletoe</i>

177
00:15:45,306 --> 00:15:48,142
<i>They kiss, why that looks
so unique, inspired</i>

178
00:15:48,225 --> 00:15:50,144
<i>They're gathering around
to hear a story</i>

179
00:15:50,227 --> 00:15:52,939
<i>Roasting chestnuts on a fire
What's this</i>

180
00:15:54,941 --> 00:15:58,653
<i>What's this in here
They've got a little tree, how queer</i>

181
00:15:58,736 --> 00:16:00,613
<i>And who would ever think
And why</i>

182
00:16:00,696 --> 00:16:02,615
<i>They're covering it
with tiny little things</i>

183
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:05,785
<i>They've got electric lights on strings
and there's a smile on everyone</i>

184
00:16:05,868 --> 00:16:08,663
<i>So now correct me if I'm wrong
This looks like fun, this looks like fun</i>

185
00:16:08,746 --> 00:16:11,248
<i>Oh, could it be I got my wish
What's this</i>

186
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:16,504
<i>Oh my, what now
The children are asleep</i>

187
00:16:16,587 --> 00:16:18,631
<i>But look
There's nothing underneath</i>

188
00:16:18,714 --> 00:16:21,759
<i>No ghouls, no witches here to scream
and scare them or ensnare them</i>

189
00:16:21,842 --> 00:16:27,265
<i>Only little cozy things
secure inside their dreamland</i>

190
00:16:30,101 --> 00:16:33,229
<i>What's this</i>

191
00:16:33,312 --> 00:16:36,107
<i>The monsters are all missing
and the nightmares can't be found</i>

192
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,068
<i>And in their place there seems
to be good feeling all around</i>

193
00:16:39,151 --> 00:16:41,862
<i>Instead of screams, I swear
I can hear music in the air</i>

194
00:16:41,946 --> 00:16:47,576
<i>The smell of cakes and pies
are absolutely everywhere</i>

195
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,330
<i>The sights, the sounds
they're everywhere and all around</i>

196
00:16:51,414 --> 00:16:53,499
<i>I've never felt so good before</i>

197
00:16:53,582 --> 00:16:57,211
<i>This empty place inside of me is
filling up I simply cannot get enough</i>

198
00:16:57,295 --> 00:16:59,839
<i>I want it, oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own</i>

199
00:16:59,922 --> 00:17:03,301
<i>I've got to know, I've got to know
what is this place that I have found</i>

200
00:17:03,384 --> 00:17:06,220
<i>What is this</i>

201
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:13,853
Christmas Town?

202
00:17:13,936 --> 00:17:15,688
Hmm.

203
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:23,362
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

204
00:17:23,446 --> 00:17:24,947
Hmm.

205
00:17:25,031 --> 00:17:27,700
- This has never happened before.
- It's suspicious.

206
00:17:27,783 --> 00:17:29,952
- It's peculiar.
- It's scary.

207
00:17:30,036 --> 00:17:33,080
Stand aside. Coming through.

208
00:17:39,337 --> 00:17:41,505
We've got to find Jack!

209
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:45,718
There's only 35 days left
till next Halloween!

210
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:47,678
Three sixty-four!

211
00:17:47,762 --> 00:17:51,223
Is there anywhere
we've forgotten to check?

212
00:17:51,307 --> 00:17:53,809
I looked in every mausoleum.

213
00:17:53,893 --> 00:17:55,895
We opened the sarcophagi!

214
00:17:55,978 --> 00:17:58,814
I tromped through
the pumpkin patch.

215
00:17:58,898 --> 00:18:01,692
I peeked behind
the cyclops' eye.

216
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:04,278
I did! But he wasn't there.

217
00:18:04,362 --> 00:18:07,073
It's time to sound the alarms!

218
00:18:36,727 --> 00:18:39,772
Frog's breath
will overpower any odor.

219
00:18:46,988 --> 00:18:49,865
Bitter!

220
00:18:49,949 --> 00:18:54,954
Worm's wart. But where,
where is that worm's wart?

221
00:18:55,037 --> 00:18:59,542
Sally? Is that soup ready yet?

222
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:03,796
Ah. Coming!

223
00:19:11,721 --> 00:19:13,639
Lunch!

224
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:18,185
Ah, what's that?

225
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:22,231
Worm's wart! Mmm!

226
00:19:22,315 --> 00:19:25,067
And frog's breath?

227
00:19:25,151 --> 00:19:29,322
Wh-What's wrong? I-I thought
you liked frog's breath.

228
00:19:29,405 --> 00:19:32,992
Nothing's more suspicious
than frog's breath.

229
00:19:33,075 --> 00:19:37,913
Until you taste it,
I won't swallow a spoonful.

230
00:19:38,664 --> 00:19:40,833
I'm not hungry. Oops.

231
00:19:42,084 --> 00:19:44,420
You want me to starve...

232
00:19:44,503 --> 00:19:49,342
an old man like me,
who hardly has strength as it is.

233
00:19:49,425 --> 00:19:53,429
Me, to whom you owe
your very life.

234
00:19:53,512 --> 00:19:56,182
Oh, don't be silly.

235
00:19:58,184 --> 00:20:02,396
Mmm! See? Scrumptious!

236
00:20:10,947 --> 00:20:14,492
Did anyone think
to dredge the lake?

237
00:20:14,575 --> 00:20:17,119
Oh, this morning.

238
00:20:18,955 --> 00:20:22,667
- Hear that? -
Ah, what? - Shh.

239
00:20:24,627 --> 00:20:26,545
Zero!

240
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,634
- Jack's back!
- Jack's back! Jack's back!

241
00:20:41,018 --> 00:20:46,232
- Where have you been?
- Call a town meeting and I'll tell everyone all about it.

242
00:20:46,315 --> 00:20:49,277
- When?
- Immediately!

243
00:20:53,781 --> 00:20:59,245
Town meeting! Town meeting!

244
00:20:59,328 --> 00:21:03,833
Town meeting tonight!

245
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:09,297
Town meeting!
Town meeting tonight!

246
00:21:26,772 --> 00:21:29,775
Listen, everyone!

247
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:33,779
I want to tell you
about Christmas Town.

248
00:21:36,907 --> 00:21:40,286
<i>There were objects so peculiar
they were not to be believed</i>

249
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:43,831
<i>All around things
to tantalize my brain</i>

250
00:21:43,914 --> 00:21:47,293
<i>It's a world unlike anything
I've ever seen</i>

251
00:21:47,376 --> 00:21:50,796
<i>And as hard as I tried
I can't seem to describe</i>

252
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,342
<i>Like a most improbable dream</i>

253
00:21:54,425 --> 00:21:57,845
<i>But you must believe
when I tell you this</i>

254
00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:03,309
<i>It's as real as my skull
and it does exist</i>

255
00:22:03,392 --> 00:22:06,395
Here, let me show you.

256
00:22:09,065 --> 00:22:10,483
Ooh!

257
00:22:10,566 --> 00:22:13,110
<i>This is a thing
called a present</i>

258
00:22:13,194 --> 00:22:15,154
<i>The whole thing
starts with a box</i>

259
00:22:15,237 --> 00:22:17,740
<i>- A box - Is it steel
- Are there locks</i>

260
00:22:17,823 --> 00:22:21,202
<i>- Is it filled with a pox
- A pox, how delightful, a pox</i>

261
00:22:21,285 --> 00:22:22,662
If you please.

262
00:22:22,745 --> 00:22:25,373
<i>Just a box with
bright colored paper</i>

263
00:22:25,456 --> 00:22:28,042
<i>And the whole thing's
topped with a bow</i>

264
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:31,462
<i>- A bow - But why - How ugly
- What's in it, what's in it</i>

265
00:22:31,545 --> 00:22:33,255
<i>That's the point of the thing
Not to know</i>

266
00:22:33,339 --> 00:22:35,967
<i>- It's a bat - Will it bend
- It's a rat - Will it break</i>

267
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:38,761
<i>Perhaps it's the head
that I found in the lake</i>

268
00:22:38,844 --> 00:22:41,347
<i>Listen now
You don't understand</i>

269
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:45,017
<i>That's not the point
of Christmasland</i>

270
00:22:45,101 --> 00:22:48,896
<i>Now pay attention
We pick up an oversized sock</i>

271
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,649
<i>And hang it like this
on the wall</i>

272
00:22:51,732 --> 00:22:53,651
<i>Oh, yes, does it still
have a foot</i>

273
00:22:53,734 --> 00:22:56,904
<i>- Let me see, let me look
- Is it rotted and covered with gook</i>

274
00:22:56,988 --> 00:22:58,614
Um, let me explain.

275
00:22:58,698 --> 00:23:01,492
<i>There's no foot inside
but there's candy</i>

276
00:23:01,575 --> 00:23:04,036
<i>- Or sometimes it's filled with small toys
- Small toys</i>

277
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,414
<i>- Do they bite - Do they
snap - Or explode in the sack</i>

278
00:23:06,497 --> 00:23:09,250
<i>Well, perhaps they just spring
out and scare girls and boys</i>

279
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:11,877
<i>What a splendid idea
This Christmas sounds fun</i>

280
00:23:11,961 --> 00:23:14,714
<i>I fully endorse it
Let's try it at once</i>

281
00:23:14,797 --> 00:23:17,216
<i>Everyone, please
Now not so fast</i>

282
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,386
<i>There's something here
that you don't quite grasp</i>

283
00:23:20,469 --> 00:23:22,805
I don't know.
Do you get it?

284
00:23:22,888 --> 00:23:26,142
Well, I may as well
give them what they want.

285
00:23:26,225 --> 00:23:29,937
<i>And the best I must confess
I have saved for the last</i>

286
00:23:30,021 --> 00:23:33,399
<i>For the ruler
of this Christmasland</i>

287
00:23:33,482 --> 00:23:36,944
<i>Is a fearsome king
with a deep, mighty voice</i>

288
00:23:37,028 --> 00:23:40,406
<i>Least, that's what
I've come to understand</i>

289
00:23:40,489 --> 00:23:43,909
<i>And I've also heard it told
That he's something to behold</i>

290
00:23:43,993 --> 00:23:47,413
<i>Like a lobster huge and red</i>

291
00:23:47,496 --> 00:23:50,958
<i>When he sets out to slay
with his rain gear on</i>

292
00:23:51,042 --> 00:23:54,462
<i>Can'ting bulging sacks
with his big great arms</i>

293
00:23:54,545 --> 00:23:57,840
<i>That is so I've heard it said</i>

294
00:23:57,924 --> 00:24:01,677
<i>And on a dark cold night
under full moonlight</i>

295
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:07,183
<i>He flies into a fog
like a vulture in the sky</i>

296
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:10,770
<i>And they call him</i>

297
00:24:10,853 --> 00:24:15,983
<i>Sandy Claws</i>

298
00:24:20,112 --> 00:24:22,615
<i>Well, at least they're excited</i>

299
00:24:22,698 --> 00:24:25,284
<i>But they don't understand</i>

300
00:24:25,368 --> 00:24:29,956
<i>That special kind of feeling
in Christmasland</i>

301
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,959
Oh, well.

302
00:24:42,677 --> 00:24:44,637
Hmm.

303
00:24:52,061 --> 00:24:54,105
Hmm.

304
00:25:05,574 --> 00:25:10,288
There's got to be a logical way
to explain this Christmas thing.

305
00:25:21,841 --> 00:25:27,430
You've poisoned me for the
last time, you wretched girl.

306
00:25:35,646 --> 00:25:39,275
Oh, my head!

307
00:25:42,069 --> 00:25:45,615
The door is open!

308
00:25:45,698 --> 00:25:49,535
- Hello!
- Jack Skellington!

309
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:54,624
- Up here, my boy.
- Doctor, I need to borrow some equipment.

310
00:25:54,707 --> 00:25:58,377
Is that so? Whatever for?

311
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:01,922
I'm conducting a series
of experiments.

312
00:26:02,006 --> 00:26:05,051
How perfectly marvelous!

313
00:26:05,134 --> 00:26:09,388
- Curiosity killed the cat, you know.
- I know.

314
00:26:09,472 --> 00:26:13,559
Come on into the lab
and we'll get you all fixed up.

315
00:26:13,643 --> 00:26:16,228
Hmm. Experiments?

316
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,859
Zero, I'm home!

317
00:27:26,424 --> 00:27:30,886
Interesting reaction!
But what does it mean?

318
00:29:10,778 --> 00:29:15,449
You can come out now
if you promise to behave.

319
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:19,537
Sally?

320
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,832
Oh, gone again!

321
00:29:36,887 --> 00:29:39,015
Hmm.

322
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:29,065
Oh!

323
00:30:52,004 --> 00:30:55,466
<i>Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack</i>

324
00:30:57,426 --> 00:31:00,513
<i>Don't know if we're ever
going to get him back</i>

325
00:31:02,598 --> 00:31:05,726
<i>He's all alone up there
locked away inside</i>

326
00:31:08,271 --> 00:31:11,023
<i>- Never says a word
- Hope he hasn't died</i>

327
00:31:11,107 --> 00:31:14,026
<i>Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack</i>

328
00:31:22,201 --> 00:31:25,371
<i>Christmastime
is buzzing in my skull</i>

329
00:31:25,454 --> 00:31:28,457
<i>Will it let me be
I cannot tell</i>

330
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:31,627
<i>There's so many things
I cannot grasp</i>

331
00:31:31,711 --> 00:31:34,755
<i>When I think I've got it
and then at last</i>

332
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:37,883
<i>Through my bony fingers
it does slip</i>

333
00:31:37,967 --> 00:31:40,595
<i>Like a snowflake
in a fiery grip</i>

334
00:31:40,678 --> 00:31:44,307
<i>Something here I'm not quite getting
Though I try I keep forgetting</i>

335
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,852
<i>Like a memory
long since past</i>

336
00:31:47,935 --> 00:31:49,895
<i>Here in an instant
Gone in a flash</i>

337
00:31:49,979 --> 00:31:53,357
<i>What does it mean
What does it mean</i>

338
00:31:53,441 --> 00:31:56,736
<i>In these little bric-a-brac
A secret's waiting to be cracked</i>

339
00:31:56,819 --> 00:32:01,157
<i>These dolls and toys confuse me so
Confound it all, I love it though</i>

340
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,077
<i>Simple objects, nothing more
But something's hidden through a door</i>

341
00:32:05,161 --> 00:32:10,499
<i>Though I do not have the key
Something's here I cannot see</i>

342
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:13,252
<i>What does it mean
What does it mean</i>

343
00:32:14,337 --> 00:32:16,088
<i>What does it mean</i>

344
00:32:16,964 --> 00:32:21,344
Hmm. Hmm.

345
00:32:21,427 --> 00:32:24,305
<i>I've read these Christmas books
so many times</i>

346
00:32:24,388 --> 00:32:27,433
<i>I know the stories
and I know the rhymes</i>

347
00:32:27,516 --> 00:32:30,519
<i>I know the Christmas carols
all by heart</i>

348
00:32:30,603 --> 00:32:33,856
<i>My skull's so full
it's tearing me apart</i>

349
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,901
<i>As often as I've read them
Something's wrong</i>

350
00:32:36,984 --> 00:32:39,946
<i>It's so hard to put
my bony finger on</i>

351
00:32:40,029 --> 00:32:43,532
<i>Or perhaps it's really not as deep
as I've been led to think</i>

352
00:32:43,616 --> 00:32:46,869
<i>Am I trying much too hard</i>

353
00:32:46,953 --> 00:32:48,829
<i>Of course
I've been too close to see</i>

354
00:32:48,913 --> 00:32:52,208
<i>The answer's right in front of me
Right in front of me</i>

355
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:56,003
<i>It's simple really, very clear
Like music drifting in the air</i>

356
00:32:56,087 --> 00:32:59,632
<i>Invisible but everywhere</i>

357
00:32:59,715 --> 00:33:04,136
<i>Just because I cannot see it
Doesn't mean I can't believe it</i>

358
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,765
<i>You know I think this Christmas thing
is not as tricky as it seems</i>

359
00:33:07,848 --> 00:33:11,227
<i>And why should they have all the fun
It should belong to anyone</i>

360
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:15,064
<i>Not anyone in fact, but me
Why I can make a Christmas tree</i>

361
00:33:15,147 --> 00:33:18,526
<i>And there's no reason I can find
I couldn't handle Christmastime</i>

362
00:33:18,609 --> 00:33:23,990
<i>I bet I could improve it too
And that's exactly what I'll do</i>

363
00:33:27,076 --> 00:33:28,536
Eureka!

364
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:33,291
This year,
Christmas will be ours!

365
00:33:37,837 --> 00:33:43,050
Patience, everyone. Jack has
a special job for each of you.

366
00:33:44,969 --> 00:33:48,264
Dr. Beetlestein.

367
00:33:48,347 --> 00:33:51,350
Your Christmas assignment
is ready.

368
00:33:53,561 --> 00:33:57,940
Dr. Beetlestein,
to the front of the line.

369
00:34:02,528 --> 00:34:05,531
What kind of noise is that
for a baby to make?

370
00:34:05,615 --> 00:34:08,367
- Perhaps it can be improved?
- No problem!

371
00:34:08,451 --> 00:34:10,244
I knew it!

372
00:34:10,328 --> 00:34:13,914
Doctor, thank you for coming.

373
00:34:13,998 --> 00:34:16,459
We need some of these.

374
00:34:16,542 --> 00:34:18,711
Hmm.

375
00:34:18,794 --> 00:34:22,381
Their construction should be
exceedingly simple, I think.

376
00:34:22,465 --> 00:34:25,885
How horrible
our Christmas will be.

377
00:34:25,968 --> 00:34:28,596
No! How jolly!

378
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:32,642
Oh. How jolly
our Christmas will be.

379
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:38,564
- What are you doing here?
- Jack sent for us.

380
00:34:38,648 --> 00:34:40,691
- Specifically.
- By name.

381
00:34:40,775 --> 00:34:43,444
- Lock. -
Shock. - Barrel.

382
00:34:43,527 --> 00:34:47,531
Jack, Jack,
it's Boogie's boys.

383
00:34:47,615 --> 00:34:52,119
Ah, Halloween's finest
trick-or-treaters.

384
00:34:52,203 --> 00:34:55,581
The job I have for you
is top secret.

385
00:34:55,665 --> 00:34:58,584
It requires craft,
cunning, mischief.

386
00:34:58,668 --> 00:35:01,837
And we thought
you didn't like us, Jack.

387
00:35:03,673 --> 00:35:07,176
Absolutely no one
is to know about it. Not a soul!

388
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,053
Now.

389
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,432
Tree.

390
00:35:14,684 --> 00:35:17,103
Christmas Town.

391
00:35:17,186 --> 00:35:20,773
Ow! Hmm.

392
00:35:20,856 --> 00:35:23,276
And one more thing.

393
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,862
Leave that no-account
Oogie Boogie out of this!

394
00:35:26,946 --> 00:35:28,614
Whatever you say, Jack.

395
00:35:28,698 --> 00:35:32,785
- Of course, Jack.
- Wouldn't dream of it, Jack.

396
00:35:51,387 --> 00:35:54,765
<i>Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws</i>

397
00:35:54,849 --> 00:35:59,895
<i>- I wanna do it - Let's draw straws
- Jack said we should work together</i>

398
00:35:59,979 --> 00:36:02,315
<i>- Three of a kind - Birds of
a feather - Now and forever</i>

399
00:36:02,398 --> 00:36:09,488
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la</i>

400
00:36:09,572 --> 00:36:13,117
<i>Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Lock him up real tight</i>

401
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,621
<i>Throw away the key
and then turn off all the lights</i>

402
00:36:16,704 --> 00:36:20,166
<i>First we're going to set some bait
inside a nasty trap and wait</i>

403
00:36:20,249 --> 00:36:23,669
<i>When he comes a-sniffing
We will snap the trap and close the gate</i>

404
00:36:23,753 --> 00:36:26,964
<i>Wait, I've got a better plan
to catch this big red lobster man</i>

405
00:36:27,048 --> 00:36:30,635
<i>Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up</i>

406
00:36:30,718 --> 00:36:34,096
<i>Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box</i>

407
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:37,600
<i>Bury him for 90 years
Then see if he talks</i>

408
00:36:39,393 --> 00:36:42,855
<i>And Mr. Oogie Boogie man</i>

409
00:36:42,939 --> 00:36:46,317
<i>Can take the whole thing
over then</i>

410
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,695
<i>He'll be so pleased I do declare</i>

411
00:36:49,779 --> 00:36:52,615
<i>That he will cook him rare
Whee</i>

412
00:36:58,788 --> 00:37:02,208
<i>I say that we take a cannon
Aim it at his door and then</i>

413
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:05,878
<i>Knock three times and when he answers
Sandy Claws will be no more</i>

414
00:37:05,962 --> 00:37:09,298
<i>You're so stupid Think now if
we blow him up to smithereens</i>

415
00:37:09,382 --> 00:37:12,718
<i>We may lose some pieces and then
Jack will beat us black and green</i>

416
00:37:12,802 --> 00:37:16,097
<i>Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Tie him in a bag</i>

417
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:19,183
<i>Throw him in the ocean
Then see if he is sad</i>

418
00:37:19,267 --> 00:37:23,229
<i>Because Mr. Oogie Boogie
is the meanest guy around</i>

419
00:37:23,312 --> 00:37:28,442
<i>- If I were on his boogie list
- I'd get out of town</i>

420
00:37:30,111 --> 00:37:33,656
<i>He'll be so pleased
by our success</i>

421
00:37:33,739 --> 00:37:37,159
<i>That he'll reward us too
I'll bet</i>

422
00:37:37,243 --> 00:37:40,579
<i>Perhaps he'll make
his special brew</i>

423
00:37:40,663 --> 00:37:42,498
<i>Of snake and spider stew</i>

424
00:37:42,581 --> 00:37:45,835
<i>We're his little henchmen
and we take ourjob with pride</i>

425
00:37:45,918 --> 00:37:49,380
<i>We do our best to please him
and stay on his good side</i>

426
00:37:49,463 --> 00:37:52,133
<i>- I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb
- I'm not the dumb one</i>

427
00:37:52,216 --> 00:37:53,926
<i>- You're no fun -
Shut up - Make me</i>

428
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:57,305
<i>I've got something, listen now
This one is real good you'll see</i>

429
00:37:57,388 --> 00:38:00,933
<i>We'll send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read</i>

430
00:38:01,017 --> 00:38:04,270
<i>Now in the box we'll wait
and hide until his curiosity</i>

431
00:38:04,353 --> 00:38:07,982
<i>Entices him to look inside and then
we'll have him one, two, three</i>

432
00:38:08,065 --> 00:38:11,319
<i>Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Beat him with a stick</i>

433
00:38:11,402 --> 00:38:14,947
<i>Lock him up for 90 years
See what makes him tick</i>

434
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:18,409
<i>Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Chop him into bits</i>

435
00:38:18,492 --> 00:38:21,954
<i>Mr. Oogie Boogie
is sure to get his kicks</i>

436
00:38:22,038 --> 00:38:25,458
<i>Kidnap the Sandy Claws
See what we will see</i>

437
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:29,086
<i>Lock him in a cage
and then throw away the key</i>

438
00:38:35,468 --> 00:38:38,846
Sandy Claws, huh?

439
00:38:45,895 --> 00:38:47,980
It goes something like this.

440
00:38:53,569 --> 00:38:55,738
How about it?
Think you can manage?

441
00:38:55,821 --> 00:38:58,240
A- one, and a-two,
and a-three, and a...

442
00:39:05,498 --> 00:39:08,751
- Next!
- Fantastic!

443
00:39:08,834 --> 00:39:12,672
Now, why don't you all practice on that,
and we'll be in great shape.

444
00:39:12,755 --> 00:39:16,259
Sally, I need your help
more than anyone's.

445
00:39:16,342 --> 00:39:19,470
You certainly do, Jack.
I had the most terrible vision.

446
00:39:19,553 --> 00:39:23,182
- That's splendid!
- No! It was about your Christmas.

447
00:39:23,266 --> 00:39:27,395
- There was smoke and fire.
- That's not my Christmas.

448
00:39:27,478 --> 00:39:31,107
My Christmas is filled
with laughter and joy.

449
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:36,821
And this: My Sandy Claws outfit.
I want you to make it.

450
00:39:36,904 --> 00:39:40,449
Jack, please listen to me.
It's going to be a disaster.

451
00:39:40,533 --> 00:39:43,786
How could it be?
Just follow the pattern.

452
00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:45,997
This part's red.
The trim is white.

453
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,458
- It's a mistake, Jack.
- Now, don't be modest.

454
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:52,295
Who else is clever enough
to make my Sandy Claws outfit?

455
00:39:52,378 --> 00:39:54,046
- Next!
- I have...

456
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,299
- Oh.
- Every confidence in you.

457
00:39:56,382 --> 00:40:00,970
But it seems wrong to me.
Very wrong.

458
00:40:01,053 --> 00:40:03,848
This device
is called a nutcracker.

459
00:40:03,931 --> 00:40:06,559
Jack! Jack! We caught 'im!
We got 'im!

460
00:40:06,642 --> 00:40:09,854
Perfect! Open it up. Quickly!

461
00:40:13,107 --> 00:40:15,318
That's not Sandy Claws!

462
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:17,820
- It isn't?
- Who is it?

463
00:40:20,573 --> 00:40:23,951
- Bunny!
- Eek! Ooh.

464
00:40:24,035 --> 00:40:26,704
Not Sandy Claws! Take him back!

465
00:40:26,787 --> 00:40:29,665
- We followed your instructions.
- We went through the door.

466
00:40:29,749 --> 00:40:33,002
Which door?
There's more than one.

467
00:40:33,085 --> 00:40:37,173
Sandy Claws is behind the door
shaped like this.

468
00:40:37,256 --> 00:40:40,426
I told you!

469
00:40:40,509 --> 00:40:42,762
- You knock it off!
- Get... Ow! Ow!

470
00:40:46,766 --> 00:40:49,352
I'm very sorry
for the inconvenience, sir.

471
00:40:49,435 --> 00:40:53,981
Take him home first!
And apologize again.

472
00:40:54,065 --> 00:40:56,525
Be careful with Sandy Claws
when you fetch him.

473
00:40:56,609 --> 00:40:58,277
- Treat him nicely.
- Got it.

474
00:40:58,361 --> 00:41:01,822
We'll get it right next time.

475
00:41:01,906 --> 00:41:05,076
You will be a decided improvement...

476
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:07,828
over that treacherous Sally.

477
00:41:07,912 --> 00:41:12,541
Master. The plans.

478
00:41:15,836 --> 00:41:18,881
Excellent, Igor.

479
00:41:28,766 --> 00:41:30,685
- What?
- What's goin' on?

480
00:41:33,312 --> 00:41:35,231
<i>This time</i>

481
00:41:37,108 --> 00:41:38,859
<i>This time</i>

482
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:40,987

484
00:41:45,324 --> 00:41:50,246
<i>Making Christmas
Making Christmas is so fine</i>

485
00:41:50,329 --> 00:41:55,418
<i>It's ours this time
And won't the children be surprised</i>

486
00:41:55,501 --> 00:41:58,296
<i>It's ours this time</i>

487

<i>- Making Christmas - Making
Christmas - Making Christmas</i>

488
00:42:03,634 --> 00:42:06,429
<i>Time to give them something fun</i>

489
00:42:06,512 --> 00:42:10,099
<i>They'll talk about
for years to come</i>

490
00:42:10,182 --> 00:42:15,605
<i>- Let's have a cheer from everyone

495
00:42:30,745 --> 00:42:33,623
<i>All together
that and this</i>

496
00:42:33,706 --> 00:42:38,794
<i>With all our tricks
we're making Christmastime</i>

497
00:42:38,878 --> 00:42:41,297
Here comes Jack.

498
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:46,928
<i>I don't believe
what's happening to me</i>

499
00:42:47,887 --> 00:42:51,641
<i>My hopes, my dreams</i>

00:42:51,724 --> 00:42:55,728
<i>My fantasies</i>

501
00:42:59,523 --> 00:43:03,986
<i>Won't they be impressed
I am a genius</i>

502
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:07,531
<i>See how I transform
this old rat</i>

503
00:43:07,615 --> 00:43:11,535
<i>Into a most delightful hat</i>

504
00:43:11,619 --> 00:43:16,374
<i>- Hmm.
- My compliments from me to you on this your most intriguing hat</i>

505
00:43:16,457 --> 00:43:20,002
<i>- Consider though this substitute A bat in place of this old rat
- Huh!</i>

506
00:43:20,086 --> 00:43:23,339
<i>No, no, no, now that's all wrong
This thing will never make a present</i>

507
00:43:23,422 --> 00:43:27,343
<i>It's been dead for much too long Try
something fresher Something pleasant</i>

<i>La, la, la
It's almost here and we can't wait</i>

514
00:44:56,891 --> 00:45:00,353
<i>So ring the bells
and celebrate</i>

515
00:45:00,436 --> 00:45:05,483
<i>'Cause when the full moon
starts to climb, we'll all sing out</i>

516
00:45:05,566 --> 00:45:08,986
<i>It's Christmastime</i>

517
00:45:20,373 --> 00:45:25,253
Kathleen, Bobby, Susie.
Yes, Susie's been nice.

518
00:45:25,336 --> 00:45:29,465
Nice, nice, naughty,
nice, nice, nice...

519
00:45:29,548 --> 00:45:32,009
There are hardly
any naughty children this year.

520
00:45:33,261 --> 00:45:36,138
Now, who could that be?

521
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:39,475
- Trick or treat!
- Huh?

522
00:45:39,558 --> 00:45:42,103
Ya!

523
00:45:44,397 --> 00:45:47,733
You don't look like yourself,
Jack, not at all.

524
00:45:47,817 --> 00:45:50,736
Isn't that wonderful?
It couldn't be more wonderful!

525
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:53,447
But you're the Pumpkin King!

526
00:45:53,531 --> 00:45:58,452
Not anymore.
And I feel so much better now!

527
00:45:58,536 --> 00:46:01,872
Jack, I know you think
something's missing, but...

528
00:46:01,956 --> 00:46:04,000
- Ow!
- Sorry.

529
00:46:04,083 --> 00:46:08,588
You're right.
Something is missing, but what?

530
00:46:08,671 --> 00:46:12,133
I've got the beard, the coat,
the boots, the belt...

531
00:46:12,216 --> 00:46:17,013
- Jack, Jack, this time we bagged him.
- This time we really did!

532
00:46:17,096 --> 00:46:20,349
- He sure is big, Jack!
- And heavy!

533
00:46:20,433 --> 00:46:22,977
Let me out!

534
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:27,690
Sandy Claws in person!
What a pleasure to meet you!

535
00:46:28,608 --> 00:46:30,818
Wh... Why, you have hands!

536
00:46:30,901 --> 00:46:33,904
- You don't have claws at all!
- Wha...

537
00:46:35,156 --> 00:46:36,866
Where am I?

538
00:46:36,949 --> 00:46:40,286
Surprised, aren't you?
I knew you would be.

539
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:43,539
You don't need to have another
worry about Christmas this year.

540
00:46:43,623 --> 00:46:47,793
- Wha... Well, wha... Wha...
- Consider this a vacation, Sandy, a reward.

541
00:46:47,877 --> 00:46:51,756
- It's your turn to take it easy.
- B-But there must be some mistake!

542
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:57,094
See that he's comfortable.
Just a second, fellas. Of course!

543
00:46:57,178 --> 00:46:59,513
- That's what I'm missing!
- B-B-but...

544
00:46:59,597 --> 00:47:01,557
- Thanks.
- Y-You just can't...

545
00:47:01,641 --> 00:47:04,143
Hold on.
Where are we going now?

546
00:47:04,226 --> 00:47:06,812
Ho, ho, ho! No.

547
00:47:06,896 --> 00:47:10,566
- This is worse than I thought.
- Ho, ho, ho. - Much worse.

548
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:13,069
- Ho, ho, ho!
- I know.

549
00:47:13,152 --> 00:47:16,364
Me, on vacation?
On Christmas Eve?

550
00:47:16,447 --> 00:47:18,366
- Where are we taking him?
- Where?

551
00:47:18,449 --> 00:47:20,409
To Oogie Boogie, of course.

552
00:47:20,493 --> 00:47:23,663
There isn't anywhere in the whole world
more comfortable than that.

553
00:47:23,746 --> 00:47:28,084
- And Jack said to make him comfortable, didn't he?
- Yes, he did.

554
00:47:28,167 --> 00:47:32,713
Haven't you heard of peace on earth
and goodwill toward men?

555
00:47:32,797 --> 00:47:34,924
No!

556
00:47:40,596 --> 00:47:44,267
Ah! This'll stop Jack.

557
00:47:56,279 --> 00:48:01,033
What a joy to think of all
we'll have in common.

558
00:48:01,117 --> 00:48:06,581
We'll have conversations
won'th having!

559
00:48:10,793 --> 00:48:12,962
Don't do this!

560
00:48:13,045 --> 00:48:15,506
Naughty children
never get any presents!

561
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:18,801
- I think he might be too big!
- Ooh!

562
00:48:18,884 --> 00:48:22,388
No, he's not.
If he can go down a chimney...

563
00:48:22,471 --> 00:48:25,766
he can fit down here.

564
00:48:53,419 --> 00:48:57,506
Well, well, well!
What have we here?

565
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:02,178
Sandy Claws, huh?
Oooh, I'm really scared!

566
00:49:02,261 --> 00:49:05,014
So you're the one
everybody's talkin' about.

567
00:49:06,432 --> 00:49:08,643
<i>You'rejokin'
You'rejokin'</i>

568
00:49:08,726 --> 00:49:10,811
<i>I can't believe my eyes</i>

569
00:49:10,895 --> 00:49:15,274
<i>You'rejokin'me, you gotta be
This can't be the right guy</i>

570
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:19,445
<i>He's ancient, he's ugly
I don't know which is worse</i>

571
00:49:19,528 --> 00:49:24,367
<i>I might just split a seam now
if I don't die laughin' first</i>

572
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:28,371
<i>Mr. Oogie Boogie says
there's trouble close at hand</i>

573
00:49:28,454 --> 00:49:32,875
<i>You better pay attention now
'cause I'm the boogie man</i>

574
00:49:32,959 --> 00:49:37,255
<i>And if you aren't shakin'
there's somethin' very wrong</i>

575
00:49:37,338 --> 00:49:41,384
<i>'Cause this may be the last time
you hear the boogie song</i>

576
00:49:41,467 --> 00:49:47,807
<i>- Whoa-oh
- Whoa-oh</i>

577
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:50,601
<i>- I'm the Oogie Boogie man
- He's the Oogie Boogie man</i>

578
00:49:50,685 --> 00:49:54,939
<i>Release me now or you must face
the dire consequences</i>

579
00:49:55,022 --> 00:49:59,026
<i>The children are expecting me
So please, come to your senses</i>

580
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:01,445
<i>Ah, you'rejokin'
You'rejokin'</i>

581
00:50:01,529 --> 00:50:03,739
<i>I can't believe my ears</i>

582
00:50:03,823 --> 00:50:07,910
<i>Would someone shut this fella up
I'm drownin' in my tears</i>

583
00:50:07,994 --> 00:50:10,413
<i>It's funny
I'm laughin'</i>

584
00:50:10,496 --> 00:50:12,415
<i>You really are too much</i>

585
00:50:12,498 --> 00:50:17,169
<i>And now with your permission
I'm going to do my stuff</i>

586
00:50:17,253 --> 00:50:20,089
- What are you going to do?
- I'm gonna do the best I can.

587
00:50:20,172 --> 00:50:22,341
<i>Whoa</i>

588
00:50:22,425 --> 00:50:26,762
<i>The sound of rolling dice to me
is music in the air</i>

589
00:50:26,846 --> 00:50:31,350
<i>'Cause I'm a gamblin' boogie man
although I don't play fair</i>

590
00:50:31,434 --> 00:50:35,438
<i>It's much more fun
I must confess with lives on the line</i>

591
00:50:35,521 --> 00:50:37,732
<i>Not mine, of course
But yours, old boy</i>

592
00:50:37,815 --> 00:50:39,942
<i>Now that'd bejust fine</i>

593
00:50:40,026 --> 00:50:44,447
<i>Release me fast or you will have to
answer for this heinous act</i>

594
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:48,701
<i>Oh, brother, you're somethin'
You put me in a spin</i>

595
00:50:48,784 --> 00:50:53,039
<i>You aren't comprehending
the position that you're in</i>

596
00:50:53,122 --> 00:50:57,335
<i>It's hopeless, you're finished
You haven't got a prayer</i>

597
00:50:57,418 --> 00:50:59,629
<i>'Cause I'm Mr. Oogie Boogie</i>

598
00:50:59,712 --> 00:51:04,050
<i>And you ain't goin'nowhere</i>

599
00:51:31,911 --> 00:51:34,497
Whoa! It's Jack!

600
00:51:40,962 --> 00:51:45,174
Think of us as you soar
triumphantly through the sky...

601
00:51:45,258 --> 00:51:48,010
outshining every star...

602
00:51:48,094 --> 00:51:52,098
your silhouette
a dark blot on the moon.

603
00:51:52,181 --> 00:51:54,558
You, who are our pride.

604
00:51:54,642 --> 00:51:57,311
You, who are our glory.

605
00:51:57,395 --> 00:52:01,732
- You, who have frightened millions into an early grave.
- Ow!

606
00:52:01,816 --> 00:52:04,527
You, who have, uh...

607
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:08,322
devastated the,
the souls of the living?

608
00:52:08,406 --> 00:52:12,368
Oh, no! We can't take off in this.

609
00:52:12,451 --> 00:52:15,955
- The reindeer can't see an inch in front of their noses.
- Whew!

610
00:52:16,038 --> 00:52:19,208
This fog's as thick as, as...

611
00:52:19,292 --> 00:52:22,545
- Jellied brains.
- Or thicker!

612
00:52:22,628 --> 00:52:25,548
There go all of my hopes...

613
00:52:25,631 --> 00:52:29,760
my precious plans,
my glorious dreams.

614
00:52:29,844 --> 00:52:33,639
There goes Christmas.

615
00:52:34,765 --> 00:52:38,185
No, Zero. Down, boy.

616
00:52:38,269 --> 00:52:41,897
My, what a brilliant nose you have!

617
00:52:41,981 --> 00:52:44,317
The better to light my way!

618
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,111
To the head
of the team, Zero!

619
00:52:48,654 --> 00:52:50,990
We're off!

620
00:52:53,993 --> 00:52:55,912
Wait, Jack! No!

621
00:53:03,502 --> 00:53:08,424
Ho-ho-ho!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ho!

622
00:53:17,558 --> 00:53:19,727
Good-bye, Jack.

623
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:22,897
My dearest Jack.

624
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:26,317
Oh, how I hope
my premonition is wrong.

625
00:53:31,489 --> 00:53:36,827
<i>I sense there's something
in the wind</i>

626
00:53:36,911 --> 00:53:42,124
<i>That feels like
tragedy's at hand</i>

627
00:53:42,208 --> 00:53:47,546
<i>And though I'd like
to stand by him</i>

628
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:52,927
<i>Can't shake this feeling
that I have</i>

629
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:58,307
<i>The worst
is just around the bend</i>

630
00:53:58,391 --> 00:54:02,436
<i>And does he notice</i>

631
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:06,816
<i>My feelings for him</i>

632
00:54:06,899 --> 00:54:09,986
<i>And will he see</i>

633
00:54:10,069 --> 00:54:14,323
<i>How much he means to me</i>

634
00:54:14,407 --> 00:54:19,579
<i>I think it's not to be</i>

635
00:54:19,662 --> 00:54:25,126
<i>What will become
of my dear friend</i>

636
00:54:25,209 --> 00:54:30,464
<i>Where will his actions
lead us then</i>

637
00:54:30,548 --> 00:54:35,845
<i>Although I'd like
to join the crowd</i>

638
00:54:35,928 --> 00:54:41,100
<i>In their enthusiastic cloud</i>

639
00:54:41,183 --> 00:54:46,564
<i>Try as I may it doesn't last</i>

640
00:54:46,647 --> 00:54:50,860
<i>And will we ever</i>

641
00:54:50,943 --> 00:54:55,114
<i>End up together</i>

642
00:54:55,197 --> 00:54:58,367
<i>No, I think not</i>

643
00:54:58,451 --> 00:55:02,705
<i>It's never to become</i>

644
00:55:02,788 --> 00:55:08,252
<i>For I am not the one</i>

645
00:55:26,854 --> 00:55:31,067
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

646
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:33,319
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

647
00:55:41,077 --> 00:55:43,287
Santa!

648
00:56:02,723 --> 00:56:05,434
Santa?

649
00:56:05,518 --> 00:56:10,106
Merry Christmas!
And what is your name?

650
00:56:10,189 --> 00:56:12,566
- Uh, uh, uh, uh...
- That's all right.

651
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:17,488
I have a special present for you
anyway. There you go, sonny.

652
00:56:17,571 --> 00:56:21,117
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

653
00:56:26,747 --> 00:56:29,208
And what did Santa
bring you, honey?

654
00:56:31,419 --> 00:56:34,672
Merry Christmas!

655
00:56:36,716 --> 00:56:39,677
Hello. Police.

656
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,348
Attacked by Christmas toys? That's strange.
That's the second toy complaint we've had.

657
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:50,396
Oh! Ha-ha-ha-ha,
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

658
00:56:51,814 --> 00:56:55,943
Oh! Ha-ha-ha-ha,
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

659
00:57:19,926 --> 00:57:21,385
Huh?

660
00:57:21,469 --> 00:57:23,387
Oh, wait!

661
00:57:28,935 --> 00:57:30,853
Whoa! Help! Help!

662
00:58:07,306 --> 00:58:11,394
You're welcome, one and all!

663
00:58:11,477 --> 00:58:13,729
Where'd you spot him?
Fast as we can, ma'am.

664
00:58:13,813 --> 00:58:16,899
Police. I know. I know.
A skeleton. Keep calm.

665
00:58:16,983 --> 00:58:20,111
Turn off all the lights. Make sure
the doors are locked. Hello. Police.

666
00:58:20,194 --> 00:58:22,822
Reports are pouring in
from all over the globe...

667
00:58:22,905 --> 00:58:26,200
that an impostor is shamelessly
impersonating Santa Claus...

668
00:58:26,284 --> 00:58:28,953
mocking and mangling
this joyous holiday.

669
00:58:30,413 --> 00:58:32,582
Authorities assure us
that at this moment...

670
00:58:32,665 --> 00:58:37,211
military units are mobilizing to stop
the perpetrator of this heinous crime.

671
00:58:37,295 --> 00:58:40,089
<i>- Jack! Someone has to help Jack.
- Wherever you are...</i>

672
00:58:40,172 --> 00:58:44,135
<i>- Where'd they take that Sandy Claws?
- Come back and save Christmas.</i>

673
00:58:53,978 --> 00:58:57,607
Look, Zero, searchlights!

674
00:59:05,197 --> 00:59:07,450
They're celebrating!

675
00:59:07,533 --> 00:59:11,621
They're thanking us
for doing such a good job.

676
00:59:11,704 --> 00:59:16,584
Whoa! Careful down there.
You almost hit us!

677
00:59:16,667 --> 00:59:20,463
It's okay, Zero. Head higher.

678
00:59:24,467 --> 00:59:27,470
Are you a gamblin' man, Sandy?

679
00:59:27,553 --> 00:59:31,182
Let's play. Hmm?

680
00:59:32,725 --> 00:59:37,313
My, my! What have we here?

681
00:59:46,989 --> 00:59:49,241
I'll get you out of here.

682
00:59:49,325 --> 00:59:53,204
Ah. Lovely.

683
00:59:53,287 --> 00:59:56,499
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Uh, tickle, tickle, tickle.

684
00:59:56,582 --> 00:59:58,709
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

685
01:00:00,753 --> 01:00:06,342
What? You try to make
a dupe out of me!

686
01:00:14,267 --> 01:00:15,309
Oh!

687
01:00:17,186 --> 01:00:19,188
Who's next on my list?

688
01:00:19,272 --> 01:00:23,693
Ah, little Harry and Jordan.
Won't they be surprised?

689
01:00:35,621 --> 01:00:39,542
They're trying to hit us. Zero!

690
01:00:49,885 --> 01:00:52,305
Merry Christmas to all...

691
01:00:52,388 --> 01:00:58,144
and to all a good night!

692
01:01:16,245 --> 01:01:20,750
I knew this Christmas thing
was a bad idea.

693
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:24,253
I felt it in my gut.

694
01:01:24,337 --> 01:01:27,131
Terrible news, folks.

695
01:01:27,214 --> 01:01:31,761
The worst tragedy of our times.

696
01:01:31,844 --> 01:01:37,183
Jack has been blown to smithereens!

697
01:01:37,266 --> 01:01:41,145
Terrible, terrible news!

698
01:01:43,189 --> 01:01:46,692
Attention. Attention, citizens.

699
01:01:46,776 --> 01:01:51,489
Terrible news. There's still
no sign of Santa Claus.

700
01:01:51,572 --> 01:01:54,909
Although the impostor
has been shot down...

701
01:01:54,992 --> 01:02:00,331
it looks like Christmas will
have to be cancelled this year.

702
01:02:00,414 --> 01:02:02,875
I repeat, the impostor
has been shot down...

703
01:02:04,627 --> 01:02:08,798
but there's still
no sign yet of Santa.

704
01:02:20,726 --> 01:02:27,400
<i>What have I done</i>

705
01:02:27,483 --> 01:02:30,736
<i>How could I</i>

706
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:34,156
<i>Be so blind</i>

707
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:37,451
<i>All is lost</i>

708
01:02:37,535 --> 01:02:40,955
<i>Where was I</i>

709
01:02:41,038 --> 01:02:47,795
<i>Spoiled all</i>

710
01:02:47,878 --> 01:02:51,048
<i>Everything's</i>

711
01:02:51,132 --> 01:02:54,510
<i>Gone all wrong</i>

712
01:02:54,594 --> 01:03:01,309
<i>What have I done</i>

713
01:03:01,392 --> 01:03:05,855
<i>Find a deep cave to hide in</i>

714
01:03:05,938 --> 01:03:08,899
<i>In a million years</i>

715
01:03:08,983 --> 01:03:13,821
<i>They'll find me only dust</i>

716
01:03:13,904 --> 01:03:18,284
<i>And a plaque that reads</i>

717
01:03:18,367 --> 01:03:23,581
<i>Here lies poor old Jack</i>

718
01:03:24,957 --> 01:03:29,962
<i>But I never intended
all this madness</i>

719
01:03:30,046 --> 01:03:31,547
<i>Never</i>

720
01:03:31,631 --> 01:03:35,718
<i>And nobody really understood</i>

721
01:03:35,801 --> 01:03:37,803
<i>Well, how could they</i>

722
01:03:37,887 --> 01:03:42,308
<i>That all I ever wanted was
to bring them something great</i>

723
01:03:42,391 --> 01:03:46,520
<i>Why does nothing ever
turn out like it should</i>

724
01:03:46,604 --> 01:03:49,315
<i>Well, what the heck</i>

725
01:03:49,398 --> 01:03:51,609
<i>I went and did my best</i>

726
01:03:51,692 --> 01:03:56,739
<i>And by God
I really tasted something swell</i>

727
01:03:56,822 --> 01:04:01,244
<i>And for a moment
why, I even touched the sky</i>

728
01:04:01,327 --> 01:04:05,706
<i>And at least I left some stories
they can tell, I did</i>

729
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:10,044
<i>And for the first time
since I don't remember when</i>

730
01:04:10,127 --> 01:04:14,298
<i>I felt just like
my old bony self again</i>

731
01:04:14,382 --> 01:04:16,550
<i>And I, Jack</i>

732
01:04:16,634 --> 01:04:19,262
<i>The Pumpkin King</i>

733
01:04:19,345 --> 01:04:24,100
<i>That's right, I am the Pumpkin King
Ha-ha-ha-ha</i>

734
01:04:24,183 --> 01:04:27,895
<i>And I just can't wait
until next Halloween</i>

735
01:04:27,979 --> 01:04:32,191
<i>'Cause I've got some new ideas
that will really make them scream</i>

736
01:04:32,275 --> 01:04:37,446
<i>And by god I'm really
going to give it all my might</i>

737
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:41,409
Uh-oh. I hope there's still time...

738
01:04:41,492 --> 01:04:44,954
to set things right.

739
01:04:45,037 --> 01:04:48,207
Sandy Claws! Hmm.

740
01:04:48,291 --> 01:04:50,585
You wait till Jack
hears about this!

741
01:04:50,668 --> 01:04:53,796
By the time he's through with
you, you'll be lucky if you...

742
01:04:53,879 --> 01:04:56,132
The King of Halloween...

743
01:04:56,215 --> 01:05:00,177
has been blown to smithereens.

744
01:05:00,261 --> 01:05:05,391
Skeleton Jack
is now a pile of dust.

745
01:05:05,558 --> 01:05:08,519
Come on, Zero.
Christmas isn't over yet.

746
01:05:16,444 --> 01:05:20,865
What's that you said
about luck, rag doll?

747
01:05:26,454 --> 01:05:29,999
Help! Help! Help!

748
01:05:30,082 --> 01:05:32,043
Shh.

749
01:05:34,295 --> 01:05:37,256
Looks like it's Oogie's turn
to boogie now.

750
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:40,176
- Help!
- One, two, three...

751
01:05:40,259 --> 01:05:43,387
four, five, six, seven.

752
01:05:43,471 --> 01:05:45,765
Help!

753
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:50,937
Ashes to ashes,
and dust to dust.

754
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:55,691
Oh, I'm feeling weak with hunger!

755
01:05:55,775 --> 01:05:58,945
One more roll of the dice
oughta do it.

756
01:06:02,114 --> 01:06:04,867
What? Snake eyes?

757
01:06:06,577 --> 01:06:09,038
Eleven!

758
01:06:09,121 --> 01:06:12,917
Looks like I won the jackpot!

759
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:18,214
Bye-bye, doll face and sandman.

760
01:06:21,092 --> 01:06:22,760
What the...

761
01:06:24,804 --> 01:06:27,807
- Hello, Oogie.
- J-J-J-Jack!

762
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:33,229
But they said you were dead.
You must be double dead!

763
01:06:33,312 --> 01:06:34,981
Oh!

764
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:44,740
Well, come on, bone man!

765
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:55,251
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! Ha!

766
01:06:59,922 --> 01:07:02,425
Fire!

767
01:07:04,802 --> 01:07:07,430
Hmm. Ooh-ooh-ooh!

768
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:16,188
Jack, look out!

769
01:07:20,901 --> 01:07:23,112
So long, Jack.

770
01:07:25,239 --> 01:07:29,994
How dare you treat my friends
so shamefully!

771
01:07:34,957 --> 01:07:38,961
Now look what you've done!

772
01:07:39,045 --> 01:07:42,757
My bugs! My bugs!

773
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:50,848
My bugs! My bugs! My bugs!

774
01:07:50,932 --> 01:07:54,018
My bugs! My bugs!

775
01:07:55,561 --> 01:07:57,521
Forgive me, Mr. Claws.

776
01:07:57,605 --> 01:07:59,815
I'm afraid I've made
a terrible mess of your holiday.

777
01:07:59,899 --> 01:08:03,110
Bumpy sleigh ride, Jack?

778
01:08:03,194 --> 01:08:08,366
The next time you get the urge to take over
someone else's holiday, I'd listen to her.

779
01:08:08,449 --> 01:08:12,161
She's the only one who makes any
sense around this insane asylum.

780
01:08:12,245 --> 01:08:15,915
- Skeletons! Boogie men! Ooh.
- I hope there's still time.

781
01:08:15,998 --> 01:08:19,377
To fix Christmas?
Of course there is!

782
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:22,380
I'm Santa Claus.

783
01:08:26,842 --> 01:08:30,429
He'll fix things, Jack.
He knows what to do.

784
01:08:30,513 --> 01:08:32,682
How did you
get down here, Sally?

785
01:08:32,765 --> 01:08:37,228
Oh, I-I was trying to...
Well, I wanted to, to...

786
01:08:37,311 --> 01:08:39,939
- To help me.
- I couldn't let you just...

787
01:08:40,022 --> 01:08:44,026
Sally, I can't believe
I never realized that you...

788
01:08:44,110 --> 01:08:47,363
- Jack! Jack! -
Here he is! - Alive!

789
01:08:47,446 --> 01:08:50,866
- Just like we said!
- Grab ahold, my boy!

790
01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:54,036
Whoa!

791
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:59,083
Good news, folks. Santa Claus, the one
and only, has finally been spotted.

792
01:08:59,166 --> 01:09:02,503
Old Saint Nick appears to be
traveling at supersonic speed.

793
01:09:02,587 --> 01:09:06,841
He's setting things right, bringing
joy and cheer wherever he goes.

794
01:09:06,924 --> 01:09:09,719
Yes, folks, Kriss Kringle
has pulled it out of the bag...

795
01:09:09,802 --> 01:09:14,599
and delivered Christmas
to excited children all over the world.

796
01:09:16,726 --> 01:09:21,105
<i>La, la, la, la
La-la-la-la</i>

797
01:09:21,188 --> 01:09:23,065
- Jack!
- Jack's back!

798
01:09:23,149 --> 01:09:26,444
- Jack? - Jack's okay! -
He's all right! - It's Jack!

799
01:09:26,527 --> 01:09:29,405
<i>Jack's okay
And he's back</i>

800
01:09:29,488 --> 01:09:31,949
<i>Oh, yea
He's all right</i>

801
01:09:32,033 --> 01:09:36,454
<i>Let's shout, make a fuss
Scream it out, whee</i>

802
01:09:36,537 --> 01:09:39,206
<i>Jack is back now
Everyone sing</i>

803
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:42,919
<i>In the town of Halloween</i>

804
01:09:43,002 --> 01:09:46,589
- It's great to be home!
- Ho-ho-ho-ho!

805
01:09:48,257 --> 01:09:51,010
Happy Halloween!

806
01:09:51,093 --> 01:09:55,139
Merry Christmas!

807
01:09:55,222 --> 01:09:57,975
<i>- What's this - What's
this - I haven't got a clue</i>

808
01:09:58,059 --> 01:10:00,269
<i>- What's this
- Why, it's completely new</i>

809
01:10:00,353 --> 01:10:02,396
<i>What's this
Must be a Christmas thing</i>

810
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,274
<i>- What's this
- It's really very strange</i>

811
01:10:12,657 --> 01:10:16,077
<i>This is Halloween
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween</i>

812
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,954
<i>What's this
What's this</i>

813
01:10:23,292 --> 01:10:26,462
Careful, my precious jewel.

814
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:58,035
<i>My dearest friend
if you don't mind</i>

815
01:10:58,119 --> 01:11:04,417
<i>I'd like to join you by your side</i>

816
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:10,798
<i>Where we can gaze
into the stars</i>

817
01:11:10,881 --> 01:11:15,177
<i>And sit together</i>

818
01:11:15,261 --> 01:11:19,432
<i>Now and forever</i>

819
01:11:19,515 --> 01:11:22,852
<i>For it is plain</i>

820
01:11:22,935 --> 01:11:27,023
<i>As anyone can see</i>

821
01:11:27,106 --> 01:11:33,154
<i>We're simply meant to be</i>
