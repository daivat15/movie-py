1
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:02,779
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

2
00:21:29,668 --> 00:21:32,115
I'm sorry.

3
00:24:00,693 --> 00:24:03,758
<i># Come a little bit closer #</i>

4
00:24:05,102 --> 00:24:08,793
<i># Hear what I have to say #</i>

5
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,219
<i># Just like children sleeping #</i>

6
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:25,616
<i># We could dream this night away #</i>

7
00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:37,870
<i># But there's a full moon rising #</i>

8
00:24:38,614 --> 00:24:42,223
<i># Let's go dancing in the light #</i>

9
00:24:51,322 --> 00:24:54,744
<i># We know where the music's playing #</i>

10
00:24:55,487 --> 00:24:59,783
<i># Let's go out and feel the night ##</i>

11
00:30:57,675 --> 00:30:59,537
Don't worry.

12
00:38:00,084 --> 00:38:01,527
Hey...

13
00:38:01,607 --> 00:38:03,413
...you're all right.

14
00:38:05,045 --> 00:38:06,895
You're all right.

15
00:38:09,989 --> 00:38:11,795
I promise.

16
00:39:31,915 --> 00:39:33,973
Why didn't you let her come?

17
00:39:43,753 --> 00:39:45,629
Do you blame her...

18
00:39:45,972 --> 00:39:47,852
...for what happened?

19
00:40:00,552 --> 00:40:02,071
No.

20
00:40:06,023 --> 00:40:08,068
Because she blames herself.

21
00:40:39,635 --> 00:40:41,532
It was no one's fault.

22
00:41:00,277 --> 00:41:02,044
You still love her, right?

23
00:41:04,355 --> 00:41:06,222
Of course I do.

24
00:41:20,993 --> 00:41:22,430
You should tell her.

25
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:29,883
It's okay. It's okay.

26
00:57:31,106 --> 00:57:32,487
You're safe.

27
00:57:33,095 --> 00:57:34,912
They can't hear us.

28
00:57:37,516 --> 00:57:39,390
It worked.

29
00:57:41,451 --> 00:57:43,490
You just need to rest now.

30
00:57:53,413 --> 00:57:55,217
Where are they?

31
00:57:56,982 --> 00:57:58,616
Where are they?

32
00:57:59,904 --> 00:58:01,739
I'll find them.

33
00:58:05,549 --> 00:58:08,385
No, she was with me. She was with me, and...

34
00:58:08,465 --> 00:58:10,926
...and then I had to go
and do laundry, and...

35
00:58:12,221 --> 00:58:14,391
...he was with you. How did he...

36
00:58:14,471 --> 00:58:16,057
Rockets.

37
00:58:20,098 --> 00:58:22,525
- So he'd still be there.
- I'm sure he is.

38
00:58:22,605 --> 00:58:26,471
He knows to wait for you. And she is...

39
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:30,028
...she's smart. She'll have found a place.

40
00:58:30,108 --> 00:58:31,960
They know what to do.

41
00:58:50,955 --> 00:58:52,833
It's a boy.

42
00:58:54,916 --> 00:58:56,719
It's a boy.

43
00:59:00,574 --> 00:59:02,412
I could've carried him.

44
00:59:09,905 --> 00:59:12,148
He was so heavy, wasn't he?

45
00:59:17,578 --> 00:59:19,181
I can still...

46
00:59:20,942 --> 00:59:23,351
...I can still feel the weight in my arms.

47
00:59:25,512 --> 00:59:27,389
Small, but...

48
00:59:27,762 --> 00:59:29,639
...so heavy.

49
00:59:37,374 --> 00:59:39,852
And my hands were free.

50
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,628
I was carrying the bag,
but my hands were free.

51
00:59:47,708 --> 00:59:49,585
You have to stop.

52
00:59:52,095 --> 00:59:54,377
So, I could've carried him.

53
00:59:57,382 --> 00:59:59,221
I should've carried him.

54
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:07,658
Who are we...

55
01:00:09,499 --> 01:00:11,553
...if we can't protect them?

56
01:00:13,634 --> 01:00:15,524
Who are we?

57
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:20,303
You have to protect them.

58
01:00:21,859 --> 01:00:23,693
Promise me...

59
01:00:24,745 --> 01:00:26,764
...you will protect them.

60
01:13:18,722 --> 01:13:20,731
Dad!
