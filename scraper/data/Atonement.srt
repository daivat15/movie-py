1
00:02:11,315 --> 00:02:13,695
-I finished my play.
-Well done.

2
00:02:13,775 --> 00:02:14,825
Have you seen Mummy?

3
00:02:14,905 --> 00:02:16,745
Well, she'll be in the drawing room, I expect.

4
00:02:16,825 --> 00:02:20,165
I hope you're not gonna be getting under
our feet today, Miss Briony.

5
00:02:20,245 --> 00:02:22,745
We got a dinner for 10 to prepare.

6
00:02:34,675 --> 00:02:38,595
-Hello, pal, I hear you're putting on a play.
-Who told you?

7
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:40,095
Jungle drums.

8
00:02:41,435 --> 00:02:45,395
-Will you come and see it?
-I'm not sure that would be quite...

9
00:02:45,475 --> 00:02:46,645
Why don't you let me read it?

10
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:49,145
You used to make me those beautiful
bound copies of all your stories.

11
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,525
-I've kept them all.
-I still want you to come.

12
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:54,575
-Let's see.
-I have to go now.

13
00:02:59,655 --> 00:03:01,325
Mummy, I need you!

14
00:03:05,335 --> 00:03:10,665
Stupendous. It's stupendous, darling.
Your first play.

15
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:12,425
Do you think so?
Do you think Leon will like it?

16
00:03:12,505 --> 00:03:14,795
Well, of course he will.

17
00:03:14,885 --> 00:03:17,595
The Trials of Arabella, by Briony Tallis.

18
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:29,985
Cee.
-Yes?

19
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,775
What do you think it would feel like
to be someone else?

20
00:03:33,855 --> 00:03:36,025
Cooler, I should hope.

21
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,785
-I'm worried about the play.
-I'm sure it's a masterpiece.

22
00:03:38,865 --> 00:03:41,785
But we only have the afternoon to rehearse.
What if the twins can't act?

23
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:44,535
You have to be nice to them.
I wonder how'd you feel if your mother

24
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:48,545
had run off with Mr What's-his-name
who reads the news on the wireless?

25
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:52,045
Perhaps I should have written Leon a story.

26
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:55,425
If you write a story, you only have to
say the word "castle," and you could see

27
00:03:55,505 --> 00:03:58,345
the towers and the woods
and the village below, but...

28
00:03:58,425 --> 00:04:01,345
In a play, it's...

29
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:04,595
It all depends on other people.

30
00:04:05,185 --> 00:04:06,895
-Cee.
-Yes?

31
00:04:08,394 --> 00:04:10,855
Why don't you talk to Robbie any more?

32
00:04:10,935 --> 00:04:14,235
I do.
We just move in different circles, that's all.

33
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:29,835
-Do we have to do a play?
-Why do we have to?

34
00:04:29,915 --> 00:04:32,835
-It's to celebrate my brother Leon's visit.
I hate plays.

35
00:04:32,915 --> 00:04:35,255
So do l.
-How can you hate plays?

36
00:04:35,335 --> 00:04:38,505
-It's just showing off.
-You'll be in this play or you'll get a clout.

37
00:04:38,595 --> 00:04:41,635
-And I'll tell the parents.
You're not allowed to clout us.

38
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:45,435
We're guests in this house. And what did
the parents say we were to make ourselves?

39
00:04:45,515 --> 00:04:47,225
-Well, Pierrot?
-Amenable.

40
00:04:47,305 --> 00:04:49,185
-Jackson?
-Amenable.

41
00:04:49,265 --> 00:04:50,975
Amenable, that's right.

42
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:55,445
Now, Briony, what's your play about?

43
00:04:56,145 --> 00:04:59,485
Well, it's about how

44
00:04:59,735 --> 00:05:02,825
love is all very well,
but you have to be sensible.

45
00:05:02,945 --> 00:05:04,955
-I suppose you're going to be Arabella.
-Well, not necessarily.

46
00:05:05,035 --> 00:05:07,535
-In that case, do you mind if I play her?
Lola was in the school play.

47
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:11,835
Do say yes. It'd be the first decent thing
to happen to me in months.

48
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,585
Well, yes, all right.

49
00:05:16,255 --> 00:05:17,875
I suppose we should start by reading it.

50
00:05:17,965 --> 00:05:21,045
If you're going to be Arabella, then I'll be
the director, thank you very much.

51
00:05:21,135 --> 00:05:22,305
Sorry.

52
00:05:25,475 --> 00:05:27,385
I'm going to do the prologue.

53
00:05:29,805 --> 00:05:31,145
"Prologue.

54
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:34,985
"This is the tale of spontaneous Arabella,

55
00:05:35,065 --> 00:05:37,815
"who ran away with an extrinsic fellow.

56
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:40,485
"It grieved her parents to see their firstborn

57
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:42,575
"evanesce from her home
to go to Eastbourne."

58
00:05:43,785 --> 00:05:44,825
Yes?

59
00:05:47,575 --> 00:05:51,375
-Nothing. Just thought I'd watch.
Rehearsals are private, I'm afraid.

60
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:53,585
You can see the play this evening.

61
00:05:53,665 --> 00:05:56,915
-I'll have to work then.
-Well, I'm sorry, Danny.

62
00:05:57,295 --> 00:05:59,885
Can we go for a swim now?
Yes, yes, yes!

63
00:05:59,965 --> 00:06:04,135
-No, I don't really think there's time!
Cecilia will let us.

64
00:06:04,255 --> 00:06:07,225
I'm sure a half-hour break
would do us all good.

65
00:06:07,305 --> 00:06:09,515
Cecilia? Cecilia!

66
00:06:11,145 --> 00:06:12,395
Cecilia!

67
00:08:19,225 --> 00:08:23,945
Cecilia! Cecilia, Cecilia.
Please, can we go for a swim, Cecilia?

68
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:27,445
Yes, I don't see why not.
Don't go out of your depth!

69
00:09:43,145 --> 00:09:46,105
Can you do me
one of your Bolshevik roll-ups?

70
00:09:51,985 --> 00:09:55,365
Beautiful day.
-I suppose so. Too hot for me.

71
00:09:57,535 --> 00:09:59,325
-Are you enjoying your book?
-No, not really.

72
00:09:59,415 --> 00:10:00,495
It gets better.

73
00:10:00,995 --> 00:10:03,165
I prefer Fielding any day.

74
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,675
Much more passionate.

75
00:10:22,185 --> 00:10:25,145
-Leon's coming down today, did you know?
-I heard a rumour.

76
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:28,195
He's bringing a friend with him.
It's Paul Marshall, the chocolate millionaire.

77
00:10:28,275 --> 00:10:30,905
-Are the flowers for him?
-Why shouldn't they be?

78
00:10:30,985 --> 00:10:33,195
Leon says he's very charming.

79
00:10:35,485 --> 00:10:38,205
The Old Man telephoned last night.
He says you're planning on being a doctor.

80
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:40,495
-I'm thinking about it, yes.
-Another six years of student life.

81
00:10:40,575 --> 00:10:42,705
-How else do you become a doctor?
-You could get a fellowship, now,

82
00:10:42,785 --> 00:10:44,375
-couldn't you? With your First?
-I don't want to teach.

83
00:10:46,585 --> 00:10:48,965
I said I'd pay your father back.

84
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,885
That's not what I meant at all.

85
00:11:03,355 --> 00:11:05,065
-Let me help with that.
-No, I'm all right, thanks.

86
00:11:05,145 --> 00:11:07,395
-Take the flowers. Take the flowers.
-I'm all right. I'm all right.

87
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,275
Oh, you idiot.

88
00:11:16,155 --> 00:11:18,115
Do you realise that's probably
the most valuable thing we own?

89
00:11:18,195 --> 00:11:20,155
Not any more, it isn't.

90
00:11:21,865 --> 00:11:23,205
Careful!

91
00:12:42,365 --> 00:12:43,455
I'm...

92
00:14:05,405 --> 00:14:06,905
Hello, Robbie!

93
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,335
No need to encourage him.

94
00:14:25,675 --> 00:14:26,765
Cee?

95
00:14:30,685 --> 00:14:31,765
Mother?

96
00:14:34,265 --> 00:14:37,685
-Where is everyone, Danny?
-I don't know, sir.

97
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:40,195
Sir.
Gasping for a drink.

98
00:14:43,195 --> 00:14:45,075
-Will you have one?
Rather.

99
00:14:46,195 --> 00:14:47,695
-Whisky?
-Please.

100
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,035
-Leon!
-Here she is.

101
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:59,005
Oh, I've missed you.
I've been going completely doolally up here.

102
00:14:59,085 --> 00:15:02,635
-This is my sister, Cecilia. Paul Marshall.
-I've heard an awful lot about you.

103
00:15:02,715 --> 00:15:04,965
-Likewise.
Where are we putting him?

104
00:15:05,055 --> 00:15:08,385
In the blue room. Mother's lying down,
she's got one of her migraines.

105
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:10,885
I'm not surprised, with this heat.

106
00:15:13,265 --> 00:15:15,895
It's the big room next to the nursery.

107
00:15:21,405 --> 00:15:22,735
Is the Old Man staying in town?

108
00:15:22,815 --> 00:15:25,485
Looks like it.
Some sort of rush on at the Ministry.

109
00:15:42,255 --> 00:15:45,505
So aren't we doing the play?
No.

110
00:15:45,595 --> 00:15:48,515
Why not?
-Don't ask me.

111
00:15:50,475 --> 00:15:52,265
I don't like it here.

112
00:15:53,845 --> 00:15:55,475
There's always a problem
when a new brand comes about.

113
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,475
The remarketing, the re-packaging,
the re-shaping.

114
00:15:57,565 --> 00:16:00,685
Even the re-flavouring in some cases,
or whole new technology.

115
00:16:01,185 --> 00:16:04,195
I think our main challenge is whether or not
to launch the new Amo Bar.

116
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:07,985
The Army Amo. Do you see? Pass the Amo?

117
00:16:09,485 --> 00:16:10,865
My source at the Ministry is very reliable,

118
00:16:10,945 --> 00:16:13,365
I used to clean his shoes at Harrow,
informs me we have a good chance

119
00:16:13,455 --> 00:16:15,415
of including it
in the standard issue ration pack.

120
00:16:15,825 --> 00:16:18,375
Which means that I'd have to open
at least three more factories.

121
00:16:18,455 --> 00:16:20,755
More if they bring in conscription,
which I say is bound to happen

122
00:16:20,835 --> 00:16:22,335
if Herr Hitler doesn't pipe down.

123
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,585
He's about as likely to do that as buy shares

124
00:16:24,675 --> 00:16:27,005
in Marks and Spencer's,
wouldn't you agree?

125
00:16:27,095 --> 00:16:30,095
-This isn't very good.
-I make a cocktail with crushed ice,

126
00:16:30,175 --> 00:16:33,845
rum and melted dark chocolate.
It's absolutely scrumptious.

127
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:43,695
Guess who we met on the way in?
-Robbie.

128
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,865
-I told him to join us tonight.
-Oh, Leon, you didn't.

129
00:16:47,525 --> 00:16:52,825
So, Robbie, the housekeeper's son,
whose father did a bunk 20 years ago,

130
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:56,625
gets a scholarship to the local grammar,
the Old Man puts him through Cambridge,

131
00:16:56,704 --> 00:17:01,085
goes up at the same time as Cee, and
for three years she hardly speaks to him.

132
00:17:01,165 --> 00:17:03,214
Wouldn't let him within a mile
of her Roedean chums.

133
00:17:03,295 --> 00:17:05,175
Anyone got a cigarette?

134
00:17:05,255 --> 00:17:08,005
I don't know what the hell he's doing
these days, messing about in flower beds.

135
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,255
As a matter of fact, he's planning on doing
a medical degree.

136
00:17:10,595 --> 00:17:13,015
And the Old Man said yes to that?

137
00:17:16,895 --> 00:17:19,724
Look, I really think you should go down
to the lodge and ask him not to come.

138
00:17:19,815 --> 00:17:22,525
Why? Has something happened
between you?

139
00:17:23,565 --> 00:17:25,105
For God's sake.

140
00:17:53,425 --> 00:17:56,475
-When can we go home?
Soon.

141
00:17:56,555 --> 00:17:58,805
We can't go home. It's a divorce.

142
00:18:01,265 --> 00:18:04,435
-How dare you say that?
-Well, it's true!

143
00:18:04,525 --> 00:18:08,025
You will never, ever use that word
again! Do you understand?

144
00:18:08,905 --> 00:18:12,615
-Now what are we going to do?
-I'm always asking myself that.

145
00:18:12,695 --> 00:18:16,655
My name is Paul Marshall.
You must be the cousins from the north.

146
00:18:16,905 --> 00:18:18,915
-What are your names?
-Pierrot.

147
00:18:18,995 --> 00:18:21,285
-Jackson.
-What marvellous names.

148
00:18:22,245 --> 00:18:23,625
Do you know our parents?

149
00:18:23,705 --> 00:18:25,125
Well, I've read
about them in the paper.

150
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:29,755
-What exactly have you read about them?
-Oh, you know. The usual sort of nonsense.

151
00:18:29,835 --> 00:18:33,715
I'll thank you not to talk about this
in front of the children.

152
00:18:38,305 --> 00:18:40,265
Your parents
are absolutely wonderful people,

153
00:18:40,345 --> 00:18:44,645
that's quite clear, and they love you
and think about you all the time.

154
00:18:45,605 --> 00:18:47,275
Jolly nice slacks.

155
00:18:48,235 --> 00:18:49,985
We went to see a show
and I got them at Liberty's.

156
00:18:50,065 --> 00:18:53,365
-What was the show?
-Hamlet.

157
00:18:53,445 --> 00:18:56,905
Ah, yes. "To be or not to be."

158
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:03,665
I like your shoes.

159
00:19:05,585 --> 00:19:11,295
Duckers in the Turl. They make
a wooden thing, shaped like your foot.

160
00:19:11,795 --> 00:19:13,385
Keep it forever.

161
00:19:14,425 --> 00:19:16,515
I'm starving. When's dinner?

162
00:19:17,675 --> 00:19:20,595
Well, I might be able to help you there,
if you can guess what I do for a living.

163
00:19:20,685 --> 00:19:23,265
-You've got a chocolate factory.
-Everyone knows that.

164
00:19:23,355 --> 00:19:26,185
Then it wasn't a guess, was it?

165
00:19:26,275 --> 00:19:30,235
There'll be one of these in every kit bag
of every soldier in the British Army.

166
00:19:30,315 --> 00:19:32,445
Sugar casing, so it won't melt.

167
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:34,655
Why should they get free sweets?

168
00:19:34,735 --> 00:19:36,235
'Cause they'll be fighting for their country.

169
00:19:36,325 --> 00:19:38,655
Our daddy says
there isn't going to be a war.

170
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,905
Your daddy is wrong.

171
00:19:42,705 --> 00:19:46,495
-Calling it the Army Amo.
-Amo, amas, amat.

172
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,705
Top marks.

173
00:19:48,795 --> 00:19:53,335
It's boring how everything ends in "o."
"Polo" and "Aero."

174
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:56,045
-And "Oxo" and "Brillo".
-Sounds as if you don't want it.

175
00:19:56,135 --> 00:19:59,265
Then I shall just have to give it
to your sister.

176
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:10,855
Bite it.

177
00:20:13,025 --> 00:20:14,775
You have to bite it.

178
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:26,875
The Princess was well aware
of his remorseless wickedness.

179
00:20:26,955 --> 00:20:30,585
But that made it no easier to overcome
the voluminous love she felt

180
00:20:30,665 --> 00:20:33,835
in her heart for Sir Romulus.
The Princess knew instinctively

181
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:35,965
that the one with red hair
was not to be trusted.

182
00:20:36,045 --> 00:20:39,465
As his young ward dived again
and again to the depths of the lake,

183
00:20:39,555 --> 00:20:43,765
in search of the enchanted chalice,
Sir Romulus twirled his luxuriant moustache.

184
00:20:43,845 --> 00:20:48,435
Sir Romulus rode with his two companions,
northwards, drawing ever closer

185
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:49,775
to an effulgent sea.

186
00:20:49,855 --> 00:20:53,065
So heroic in manner,
he appeared so valiant in word

187
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:56,565
no one could ever guess at the darkness

188
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:59,235
lurking in the black heart
of Sir Romulus Turnbull.

189
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:02,245
He was the most dangerous man
in the world.

190
00:21:10,545 --> 00:21:14,005
"Dear Cecilia, I thought I should write
to apologise for my clumsy

191
00:21:14,085 --> 00:21:15,965
"and inconsiderate behaviour."

192
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:47,725
"Forgive me if I seem strange but I'm..."

193
00:24:13,145 --> 00:24:17,315
Dear Cecilia, you'd be forgiven
for thinking me mad,

194
00:24:17,395 --> 00:24:19,185
the way I acted this afternoon.

195
00:24:19,275 --> 00:24:23,315
The truth is I feel rather lightheaded
and foolish in your presence, Cee,

196
00:24:23,405 --> 00:24:25,735
and I don't think I can blame the heat.

197
00:24:27,485 --> 00:24:28,985
"Will you forgive me?

198
00:24:32,035 --> 00:24:33,325
"Robbie."

199
00:24:50,765 --> 00:24:52,345
Off out then?

200
00:24:52,425 --> 00:24:55,015
Yes, Leon's asked me
to join them for dinner.

201
00:24:56,015 --> 00:24:59,565
So that's why I've been polishing
silver all afternoon.

202
00:24:59,645 --> 00:25:02,855
I'll think of you when I see my face
in the spoon.

203
00:25:06,445 --> 00:25:11,115
You're not a bit like your father.
Not in any way.

204
00:25:11,195 --> 00:25:14,035
That's because I'm all yours. I'll be late.

205
00:25:16,165 --> 00:25:18,585
Your shirts are hanging upstairs.

206
00:25:22,045 --> 00:25:24,165
-Son.
-Yes?

207
00:25:24,835 --> 00:25:26,255
Nothing.

208
00:26:18,845 --> 00:26:20,855
Briony! Is that you?

209
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:45,415
Are you all right?

210
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:51,425
Do you think you could do me a favour?

211
00:26:52,095 --> 00:26:55,345
Could you run ahead
and give this to Cee? I...

212
00:26:55,425 --> 00:27:00,145
-Feel a bit of a fool handing it over myself.
-All right.

213
00:27:25,915 --> 00:27:27,125
Briony.

214
00:27:54,025 --> 00:27:55,905
Briony!

215
00:28:15,885 --> 00:28:18,635
-I suppose he's what you might call eligible.
-Rather.

216
00:28:18,715 --> 00:28:20,885
He certainly seems to think
he's the cat's pyjamas.

217
00:28:20,975 --> 00:28:24,305
Which is odd, considering he has pubic hair
growing out of his ears.

218
00:28:24,395 --> 00:28:27,855
I should imagine he'd give you
a lot of very noisy, boneheaded sons.

219
00:28:27,935 --> 00:28:30,315
-He's quite a good egg, actually.
-You say that about everyone.

220
00:28:30,395 --> 00:28:34,195
-Leon!
-Rummy, if it ain't my little sis!

221
00:28:34,275 --> 00:28:37,275
I wrote you a play, Leon.
I wanted to do a play for you.

222
00:28:37,365 --> 00:28:39,155
-The Trials Of Arabella.
-Well, there's still time.

223
00:28:39,235 --> 00:28:40,825
-Doesn't have to be this evening.
-No, it's impossible.

224
00:28:40,905 --> 00:28:42,325
Briony.
Tell you what. I'm good at voices,

225
00:28:42,405 --> 00:28:44,245
you're even better,
so we'll read it out after dinner.

226
00:28:44,325 --> 00:28:47,245
-Briony, did you read this letter?
-Yes, let's. That's a wonderful idea.

227
00:28:47,335 --> 00:28:51,755
-Briony!
-Here we are. My choc-tail.

228
00:28:52,255 --> 00:28:54,125
I insist you try it.

229
00:28:55,045 --> 00:28:56,965
Wasn't there an envelope?

230
00:29:08,395 --> 00:29:10,105
Do you mind if I come in?

231
00:29:11,775 --> 00:29:14,145
I've had the most appalling evening.

232
00:29:15,695 --> 00:29:18,235
The twins have been torturing me. Look.

233
00:29:18,325 --> 00:29:19,655
How awful.

234
00:29:22,785 --> 00:29:24,115
Chinese burns.

235
00:29:25,705 --> 00:29:27,665
That's right.

236
00:29:27,995 --> 00:29:32,835
They want to go home.
They think it's me that's keeping them here.

237
00:29:38,675 --> 00:29:40,055
Lola.

238
00:29:40,755 --> 00:29:45,135
Can I tell you something?
Something really terrible.

239
00:29:45,225 --> 00:29:46,515
Yes, please.

240
00:29:47,345 --> 00:29:50,475
What's the worst word
you can possibly imagine?

241
00:30:01,075 --> 00:30:03,325
-He's a sex maniac!
-That's right.

242
00:30:03,405 --> 00:30:04,905
-What's Cecilia going to do?
-I don't know.

243
00:30:04,995 --> 00:30:07,575
-You ought to call the police.
-Do you think so?

244
00:30:07,665 --> 00:30:10,375
He said he thought about it all day long.

245
00:30:10,455 --> 00:30:12,625
All you have to do is show them the letter.

246
00:30:12,705 --> 00:30:15,505
-You won't tell anyone, will you, promise?
-I promise.

247
00:30:15,585 --> 00:30:18,795
Good. If he found out,
there's no knowing what he might do.

248
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:20,095
You're right.

249
00:30:22,345 --> 00:30:25,635
You better tidy your face.
I've still got to change.

250
00:30:27,975 --> 00:30:30,555
Thanks, Briony. You're a real brick.

251
00:32:52,035 --> 00:32:53,165
Cecilia!

252
00:33:11,385 --> 00:33:13,845
-It was a mistake.
-Briony read it.

253
00:33:14,135 --> 00:33:16,395
My God, I'm so sorry.
It was the wrong version.

254
00:33:16,475 --> 00:33:17,765
Yes.

255
00:33:21,605 --> 00:33:23,695
-It was never meant to be read.
-No.

256
00:33:58,975 --> 00:34:00,565
What was in the version
I was meant to read?

257
00:34:00,645 --> 00:34:02,605
I don't know. It was more formal. Less...

258
00:34:02,685 --> 00:34:04,315
-Anatomical?
-Yes.

259
00:34:10,945 --> 00:34:15,155
It's been there for weeks,
and then this morning by the fountain...

260
00:34:24,455 --> 00:34:27,335
I've never done anything like that before.

261
00:34:27,675 --> 00:34:30,635
And I was so angry with you,
and with myself.

262
00:34:33,465 --> 00:34:36,975
I thought if you went away to medical
school, then I'd be happy, but...

263
00:34:37,054 --> 00:34:40,645
I don't know how I could have been
so ignorant about myself, so...

264
00:34:44,565 --> 00:34:46,105
So stupid.

265
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:55,655
You do know what I'm talking about,
don't you?

266
00:34:58,325 --> 00:35:01,165
You knew before I did.

267
00:35:02,835 --> 00:35:04,665
Why are you crying?

268
00:35:06,215 --> 00:35:07,835
Don't you know?

269
00:35:08,335 --> 00:35:10,085
Yes, I know exactly.

270
00:36:54,405 --> 00:36:55,485
Robbie.

271
00:36:56,445 --> 00:36:57,525
Cecilia.

272
00:36:59,445 --> 00:37:00,575
I love you.

273
00:37:03,115 --> 00:37:04,495
I love you.

274
00:37:45,665 --> 00:37:47,325
Someone's come in.

275
00:37:48,995 --> 00:37:50,245
Cecilia!

276
00:38:34,295 --> 00:38:36,255
People were sitting out
having dinner on the pavement.

277
00:38:36,335 --> 00:38:40,755
It was always the view of my parents
that hot weather encouraged loose morals.

278
00:38:40,845 --> 00:38:43,215
In high summer, my sister and l
were never allowed out of the house.

279
00:38:43,305 --> 00:38:47,015
They thought the villagers would be
unnecessarily provoked.

280
00:38:48,935 --> 00:38:52,815
What do you say, Cee? Does the hot weather
make you behave badly?

281
00:38:54,605 --> 00:38:57,565
-Good heavens, you're blushing.
-It's just hot in here, that's all.

282
00:38:57,645 --> 00:39:00,235
Lola, wipe that lipstick off.
You're far too young.

283
00:39:00,315 --> 00:39:04,035
What about you, Briony?
What sins have you committed today?

284
00:39:04,905 --> 00:39:08,205
-I've done nothing wrong.
Have you seen the twins recently?

285
00:39:08,325 --> 00:39:10,995
They didn't look very happy
last time I saw them, poor little chaps.

286
00:39:11,075 --> 00:39:14,455
You know nothing about it.
-Briony. I can't imagine what's got into you.

287
00:39:14,545 --> 00:39:17,085
-I've never known you to be so rude.
Well, they're not poor little chaps.

288
00:39:17,165 --> 00:39:19,295
-Just look what they did to Lola.
-What are you talking about?

289
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:22,595
Jackson and Pierrot
bruised her arm. Gave her Chinese burns.

290
00:39:22,675 --> 00:39:24,595
I'm afraid she's quite right.
I had to pull them off her.

291
00:39:24,675 --> 00:39:27,015
How I got my war wound.

292
00:39:27,095 --> 00:39:28,515
The twins did that, Lola?

293
00:39:28,595 --> 00:39:30,475
Yes, it all turned
into a bit of a wrestle,

294
00:39:30,555 --> 00:39:32,895
I'm afraid. Still, no harm done, eh, Lola?

295
00:39:32,975 --> 00:39:34,645
Would you go and find these boys,
please, Briony?

296
00:39:34,725 --> 00:39:36,435
Tell them dinner's ready,
and where are their manners?

297
00:39:36,525 --> 00:39:38,445
-Why do I have to go?
-Briony, you'll do as you're told,

298
00:39:38,525 --> 00:39:41,025
or you'll go straight to your room.

299
00:40:10,135 --> 00:40:11,645
It's a letter!
-Give it to me!

300
00:40:11,725 --> 00:40:13,305
They've run away.
Who has?

301
00:40:13,395 --> 00:40:14,725
The twins.

302
00:40:15,645 --> 00:40:20,645
"We are going to run away because Lola
is so horrid to us and we want to go home.

303
00:40:22,315 --> 00:40:23,865
-"Also, there wasn't a play."
-Don't worry.

304
00:40:23,945 --> 00:40:26,195
We'll send out some search parties.
They can't have gone far.

305
00:40:26,285 --> 00:40:28,325
Cee, you come with me.

306
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:35,205
Pierrot!

307
00:40:36,035 --> 00:40:37,125
Jackson!

308
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:39,455
Boys!

309
00:40:40,665 --> 00:40:41,755
Jackson!

310
00:40:43,965 --> 00:40:45,045
Pierrot!

311
00:42:25,105 --> 00:42:27,155
Lola? Are you all right?

312
00:42:27,735 --> 00:42:30,575
I'm sorry. I didn't... I'm sorry.

313
00:42:30,655 --> 00:42:32,735
Who was it?

314
00:42:34,995 --> 00:42:36,325
I saw him.

315
00:42:37,365 --> 00:42:38,455
I saw him.

316
00:42:39,495 --> 00:42:41,745
-It was him, wasn't it?
-Yes, it was him.

317
00:42:41,835 --> 00:42:43,415
Lola, who was it?

318
00:42:45,545 --> 00:42:49,005
It was Robbie, wasn't it? Robbie?

319
00:42:50,795 --> 00:42:53,465
-You saw him?
-Like you said, he's a sex maniac.

320
00:42:53,555 --> 00:42:56,305
And you don't even know
what happened before dinner.

321
00:42:56,385 --> 00:42:57,975
I caught him attacking my sister
in the library.

322
00:42:58,055 --> 00:43:00,265
I don't know what he'd have done
if I hadn't come in.

323
00:43:00,355 --> 00:43:03,815
-You actually saw him?
-Of course I did. Plain as day.

324
00:43:05,645 --> 00:43:09,945
He pushed me to the ground.
And then he put his hands over my eyes.

325
00:43:11,115 --> 00:43:16,195
-I couldn't actually... I never actually...
-Listen. I've known him

326
00:43:16,285 --> 00:43:18,495
my whole life, and I saw him.

327
00:43:19,285 --> 00:43:21,665
Because I couldn't say for sure.

328
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:25,205
Well, I can. And I will.

329
00:43:30,005 --> 00:43:33,595
Call the police.
And she'll be needing a doctor, as well.

330
00:43:44,515 --> 00:43:48,815
-It's all right, dear. It's all right now.
Is Robbie back yet?

331
00:43:48,895 --> 00:43:51,105
I haven't seen him.

332
00:43:51,525 --> 00:43:53,365
I know who it was.

333
00:43:55,825 --> 00:43:59,285
-You saw him, then?
-Yes, I saw him.

334
00:43:59,365 --> 00:44:02,415
-Just as you see me?
-I know it was him.

335
00:44:02,495 --> 00:44:05,875
You know it was him? Or you saw him?

336
00:44:07,205 --> 00:44:10,715
-Yes, I did, I saw him.
-With your own eyes?

337
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:15,505
Yes. I saw him, I saw him with my own eyes.

338
00:44:19,475 --> 00:44:21,055
Well done, darling.

339
00:45:12,645 --> 00:45:16,155
My brother and I found the two of them
down by the lake.

340
00:45:16,235 --> 00:45:18,365
You didn't see anyone else?

341
00:45:20,575 --> 00:45:25,285
I wouldn't necessarily believe everything
Briony tells you. She's rather fanciful.

342
00:45:33,505 --> 00:45:36,635
When they went looking,
I went up to my dad's.

343
00:45:36,715 --> 00:45:39,345
-I did, honest.
Why was that?

344
00:45:40,635 --> 00:45:42,385
To tell him all about it.

345
00:45:44,435 --> 00:45:47,975
-I know I shouldn't have opened it.
No, you should not.

346
00:45:49,475 --> 00:45:52,435
But at least you've done the right thing now.

347
00:46:31,525 --> 00:46:33,735
Sir, there is someone coming.

348
00:47:02,965 --> 00:47:04,805
-Time you went to bed.
-But...

349
00:47:04,885 --> 00:47:06,015
Now.

350
00:48:19,005 --> 00:48:20,085
Cecilia!

351
00:48:43,365 --> 00:48:47,995
You liars! You liars! Liars! Liars!

352
00:49:27,905 --> 00:49:30,075
Northern France
Four years later

353
00:49:35,575 --> 00:49:39,085
I says to him, I says, "You can sit
down there, twiddling your thumbs,

354
00:49:39,165 --> 00:49:41,255
"waiting to get your head blown off,
if you want to.

355
00:49:41,335 --> 00:49:42,505
"I'm off out of it."

356
00:49:52,175 --> 00:49:56,145
Bonsoir monsieur. Bonsoir?
Let me do this.

357
00:50:11,365 --> 00:50:12,785
What's his game?

358
00:50:12,865 --> 00:50:15,165
-He says he's got something for us.
-Fucking hell!

359
00:50:16,495 --> 00:50:18,705
Wait! We have food for you

360
00:50:18,835 --> 00:50:19,955
Bread, sugar

361
00:50:20,045 --> 00:50:21,125
And wine!

362
00:50:31,515 --> 00:50:33,175
What are you doing here?

363
00:50:39,435 --> 00:50:42,985
When the retreat started, Panzers attacked,

364
00:50:43,985 --> 00:50:46,145
and I was separated from my unit

365
00:50:46,315 --> 00:50:48,815
So it's true, the English are retreating

366
00:50:51,655 --> 00:50:54,325
We'll be gone at first light

367
00:50:55,865 --> 00:50:58,745
We fought all those years,
lost all those dead,

368
00:50:59,205 --> 00:51:01,705
now the Germans are in France again

369
00:51:05,255 --> 00:51:06,675
We will come back

370
00:51:08,835 --> 00:51:10,505
we will throw them out

371
00:51:12,345 --> 00:51:15,135
I promise you

372
00:51:16,515 --> 00:51:18,185
Good luck

373
00:51:23,185 --> 00:51:24,565
Come on, then.

374
00:51:24,645 --> 00:51:28,655
How come a toff like you, talks French
and everything, ends up a private?

375
00:51:28,735 --> 00:51:32,365
Not eligible for officers' training
if you join direct from prison.

376
00:51:32,525 --> 00:51:35,785
-You're pulling my tit.
-No, I'm not.

377
00:51:37,365 --> 00:51:40,825
They gave me a choice.
Stay in prison or join the Army.

378
00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:45,045
And for the record,
the last thing I am is a toff.

379
00:52:04,015 --> 00:52:06,065
Six months earlier

380
00:52:33,255 --> 00:52:34,755
I'm sorry I'm late, I got lost.

381
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:36,635
-Hello.
-Hello.

382
00:52:46,395 --> 00:52:48,935
-Should we sit down?
-Yes, of course.

383
00:53:04,035 --> 00:53:07,205
-I'm sorry, I can't remember, l...
-Two. Thank you.

384
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:43,665
Where are you living?

385
00:53:45,325 --> 00:53:47,665
Tiny flat in Balham. It's ghastly.

386
00:53:47,745 --> 00:53:51,045
-The landlady's rude and horribly nosy.
-You look the same.

387
00:53:51,125 --> 00:53:53,625
-Apart from the uniform, of course.
-Yes, I'm sorry. I've got to go back

388
00:53:53,715 --> 00:53:56,845
-to the hospital in half an hour.
-Oh, God, that...

389
00:54:18,195 --> 00:54:19,615
-Sorry.
-No.

390
00:54:23,745 --> 00:54:26,325
Have you been in touch with your family?

391
00:54:26,415 --> 00:54:28,455
No, I told you I wouldn't.

392
00:54:29,955 --> 00:54:32,335
Leon waited outside the hospital last week,
I just pushed past him.

393
00:54:32,415 --> 00:54:35,175
Cee, you don't owe me anything.

394
00:54:37,295 --> 00:54:39,925
Robbie, didn't you read my letters?

395
00:54:40,345 --> 00:54:42,555
Had I been allowed to visit you,
had they let me every day,

396
00:54:42,635 --> 00:54:45,135
-I would have been there every day.
-Yes, but...

397
00:54:45,225 --> 00:54:48,805
If all we have rests on a few moments

398
00:54:48,895 --> 00:54:51,475
in a library three and a half years ago,
then I'm not sure,

399
00:54:51,565 --> 00:54:54,695
-I don't know if...
-Robbie, look at me.

400
00:54:57,855 --> 00:55:00,485
Look at me.

401
00:55:01,575 --> 00:55:02,945
Come back.

402
00:55:06,155 --> 00:55:07,875
Come back to me.

403
00:55:22,135 --> 00:55:23,885
Dearest Cecilia.

404
00:55:25,595 --> 00:55:27,725
Dearest Cecilia.

405
00:55:34,985 --> 00:55:36,105
Cecilia.

406
00:55:51,625 --> 00:55:53,705
A friend of mine has a cottage by the coast.

407
00:55:53,795 --> 00:55:56,125
Said we can borrow it
when you're next on leave.

408
00:55:56,215 --> 00:55:59,335
White clapboard
with blue-painted window frames.

409
00:56:01,135 --> 00:56:04,505
-I hope this bus never comes.
-Here.

410
00:56:06,675 --> 00:56:09,515
Something to think of while you're away.

411
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:33,085
I love you.

412
00:58:03,835 --> 00:58:06,005
Some poor sod's gonna catch a packet.

413
00:58:14,555 --> 00:58:18,815
My darling. Briony found
my address somehow, and sent a letter.

414
00:58:20,025 --> 00:58:22,775
The first surprise was
she didn't go up to Cambridge.

415
00:58:22,855 --> 00:58:25,655
She's doing nurse's training
at my old hospital.

416
00:58:26,865 --> 00:58:29,655
I think she may be doing this
as some kind of penance.

417
00:58:29,735 --> 00:58:34,455
She says she's beginning to get the full
grasp of what she did, and what it meant.

418
00:58:34,575 --> 00:58:37,075
She wants to come and talk to me.

419
00:58:38,415 --> 00:58:43,165
I love you. I'll wait for you. Come back.

420
00:58:44,585 --> 00:58:45,675
Come back to me.

421
00:58:47,005 --> 00:58:49,425
Come back. Come back to me.

422
00:58:50,465 --> 00:58:53,635
Come back. Come back to me.

423
00:58:57,055 --> 00:58:59,055
So where we going, guv?

424
00:59:13,785 --> 00:59:16,035
Fucking hate those boots!

425
00:59:16,115 --> 00:59:18,915
I hate them worse
than all the fucking Germans put together!

426
00:59:18,995 --> 00:59:22,165
You'll have a job getting back to England
in your socks.

427
01:00:59,935 --> 01:01:02,685
Come on, pal,
you should be getting dressed.

428
01:01:02,765 --> 01:01:05,935
-If I fell in, would you save me?
-Of course.

429
01:01:18,615 --> 01:01:19,655
Briony!

430
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:46,105
Thank you.

431
01:01:54,405 --> 01:01:55,865
Thank you! Thank you, thank you!

432
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:58,695
That's an incredibly bloody
stupid thing to do.

433
01:01:58,825 --> 01:02:00,195
I wanted you to save me.
-Don't you know

434
01:02:00,285 --> 01:02:01,955
how easily you could have drowned?

435
01:02:02,285 --> 01:02:05,125
-You saved me.
-Stupid child!

436
01:02:05,205 --> 01:02:09,045
You could have killed us both.
Is that your idea of a joke?

437
01:02:10,795 --> 01:02:13,505
I want to thank you for saving my life.

438
01:02:14,675 --> 01:02:17,295
I will be eternally grateful to you.

439
01:02:29,815 --> 01:02:31,685
The story can resume.

440
01:02:32,485 --> 01:02:36,525
Our story can resume. I will simply resume.

441
01:02:37,155 --> 01:02:39,615
Jerry, come and have a go at us
in fucking South End.

442
01:02:39,695 --> 01:02:44,705
Or better still, Trafalgar Square.
No one speaks the fucking lingo out here.

443
01:02:44,785 --> 01:02:47,705
You can't say, "Pass the biscuit," or
"Where's me hand grenade?"

444
01:02:47,785 --> 01:02:51,335
They just shrug. Because they hate us, too.
I mean, that's the point.

445
01:02:51,415 --> 01:02:54,835
We fight in France
and the French fucking hate us.

446
01:02:54,925 --> 01:02:58,095
Make me Home Secretary,
I'll sort this out in a fucking minute.

447
01:02:58,175 --> 01:03:00,675
We got India and Africa, right?

448
01:03:00,755 --> 01:03:04,135
Jerry can have France and Belgium
and wherever else they want.

449
01:03:04,225 --> 01:03:08,105
Who's fucking ever been to Poland?
It's all about room, empire.

450
01:03:08,185 --> 01:03:11,275
They want more empire,
give 'em this shithole, we keep ours,

451
01:03:11,355 --> 01:03:14,485
and it's "Bob's your uncle"
and "Fanny's your fucking aunt"!

452
01:03:14,565 --> 01:03:16,145
Think about it.

453
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:29,375
Dearest Cecilia.
The story can resume.

454
01:03:31,705 --> 01:03:34,965
The one I had been planning
on that evening walk.

455
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:39,255
I can become again the man
who once crossed the Surrey park

456
01:03:39,335 --> 01:03:43,885
at dusk in my best suit,
swaggering on the promise of life.

457
01:03:43,965 --> 01:03:48,595
The man who, with the clarity of passion,
made love to you in the library.

458
01:03:53,185 --> 01:03:55,065
The story can resume.

459
01:03:59,155 --> 01:04:01,825
I will return,

460
01:04:02,025 --> 01:04:04,745
find you, love you,

461
01:04:04,825 --> 01:04:08,325
marry you. And live without shame.

462
01:04:25,965 --> 01:04:27,635
You can smell the sea.

463
01:04:59,965 --> 01:05:01,005
Fuck me.

464
01:05:02,335 --> 01:05:07,215
-It's like something out of the Bible.
Jesus Christ.

465
01:05:09,385 --> 01:05:11,595
Come on, get everybody
to clean this mess up now.

466
01:05:11,975 --> 01:05:14,605
We've just arrived, sir. Can you
tell us what we're supposed to be doing?

467
01:05:14,685 --> 01:05:16,975
Nothing. Just wait.
Where are the ships?

468
01:05:17,065 --> 01:05:19,735
A few made it in yesterday,
Luftwaffe blew them to buggery.

469
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:22,605
Lost 3,000 men
when they sank the Lancastria.

470
01:05:22,695 --> 01:05:26,155
High command, in its infinite wisdom,
is denying us air cover.

471
01:05:26,235 --> 01:05:28,115
A disgrace, a fucking disaster.

472
01:05:28,195 --> 01:05:30,865
No, look, the thing is, you see,
I'm expected back, you see.

473
01:05:30,955 --> 01:05:34,705
There's over 300,000 men on this beach,
Private. You'll have to wait your turn.

474
01:05:34,785 --> 01:05:39,165
Just be grateful you're not wounded.
I've orders to leave the wounded behind.

475
01:05:39,715 --> 01:05:44,635
No, no, no, leave it, guv! Never trust a sailor
on dry land. You're best off out of it.

476
01:05:59,105 --> 01:06:00,435
That's not right.

477
01:06:25,135 --> 01:06:26,215
Christ.

478
01:06:33,595 --> 01:06:35,475
Can you hear me, laddies?

479
01:06:35,555 --> 01:06:37,895
I'm coming home!

480
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:41,165
Take from our souls
the strain and stress

481
01:07:41,245 --> 01:07:45,585
And let our ordered lives confess

482
01:07:45,665 --> 01:07:49,845
The beauty of Thy peace

483
01:07:49,925 --> 01:07:54,845
The beauty of Thy peace

484
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:59,935
Breathe through the heats of our desire

485
01:08:00,015 --> 01:08:04,315
Thy coolness and Thy balm

486
01:08:04,475 --> 01:08:08,814
Let sense be numb, let flesh retire

487
01:08:08,904 --> 01:08:13,234
Speak through the earthquake, wind and fire

488
01:08:13,325 --> 01:08:17,575
O still, small voice of calm

489
01:08:48,234 --> 01:08:49,314
Guv'nor.

490
01:08:53,154 --> 01:08:55,575
I have to get something to drink.

491
01:08:55,654 --> 01:08:58,205
You need one. You're grey.

492
01:08:58,285 --> 01:09:01,115
He's gone all grey, can you see?

493
01:09:17,135 --> 01:09:18,885
There. Come on.

494
01:09:21,095 --> 01:09:22,765
All I want's a cup of tea now.

495
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:42,535
What the fuck you doing?

496
01:10:07,315 --> 01:10:13,195
I'm coming home!
Laddie, I'm coming home!

497
01:10:16,115 --> 01:10:22,535
Fuck 'em all! Fuck 'em all!
The long and the short and the tall

498
01:10:22,615 --> 01:10:27,455
Fuck all the Sergeants and WO1s
Fuck all the corporals

499
01:10:27,535 --> 01:10:29,085
and their bastard sons

500
01:10:29,165 --> 01:10:35,465
'Cause we're saying goodbye to them all
As back to their billets they crawl

501
01:10:35,585 --> 01:10:38,965
You'll get no promotion
this side of the ocean

502
01:10:39,055 --> 01:10:42,805
So cheer up, my lads
Fuck 'em all!

503
01:11:52,915 --> 01:11:54,415
Mike!

504
01:12:01,175 --> 01:12:02,635
Mike!

505
01:12:05,095 --> 01:12:06,345
Hold up, guv.

506
01:12:14,935 --> 01:12:16,065
Wait here.

507
01:12:56,485 --> 01:12:58,105
Why don't you sit down?

508
01:13:06,825 --> 01:13:08,745
It's so hot in here.

509
01:13:09,325 --> 01:13:11,205
Take off your boots.

510
01:13:30,515 --> 01:13:34,225
I have to get back. I promised her.

511
01:13:34,305 --> 01:13:36,525
To put things right.

512
01:13:36,605 --> 01:13:40,855
And she loves me. She's waiting for me.

513
01:13:45,075 --> 01:13:46,115
Oi!

514
01:13:49,445 --> 01:13:50,615
Wait, wait, wait.

515
01:13:51,785 --> 01:13:54,875
Hey, what have you done with your boots?

516
01:13:57,495 --> 01:14:00,125
-Look, you're sure you're feeling all right?
-Never better.

517
01:14:00,215 --> 01:14:04,255
Now I'm wondering whether the beach
really is the best place for dinner.

518
01:14:05,925 --> 01:14:10,975
-I'm not sure, I don't recognise it.
-Dunno.

519
01:14:11,055 --> 01:14:13,265
-This'll do, down here.
-No.

520
01:14:14,395 --> 01:14:16,975
-No, no, it's further on.
-What is?

521
01:14:17,065 --> 01:14:19,275
This place I know, an old cottage
with white clapboards

522
01:14:19,355 --> 01:14:21,945
and blue-painted window frames.

523
01:14:23,815 --> 01:14:27,865
Aw, yes.
That's right, that's where we're going.

524
01:14:27,945 --> 01:14:32,115
-It's close to here.
-We're there. This is it.

525
01:14:54,765 --> 01:14:57,355
Here we are, guv. Down here.

526
01:15:34,095 --> 01:15:36,805
That's all right, guv. That's right.

527
01:15:38,855 --> 01:15:43,395
Get your head down. Get your head down.
There you go.

528
01:15:58,875 --> 01:16:01,835
Tuck yourself in. Keep yourself warm.

529
01:16:08,965 --> 01:16:13,715
Chew on a bit of this. But quiet like,
or they'll all be wanting some.

530
01:16:17,345 --> 01:16:19,435
Try and get some sleep.

531
01:17:51,405 --> 01:17:52,525
Find you.

532
01:17:53,865 --> 01:17:55,115
Love you.

533
01:17:55,905 --> 01:17:57,405
Marry you.

534
01:17:58,245 --> 01:18:00,115
And live without shame.

535
01:18:30,685 --> 01:18:36,575
I love you. Come back. Come back to me.

536
01:18:42,745 --> 01:18:44,915
Bit too much noise, guv'nor.
-What?

537
01:18:47,085 --> 01:18:49,545
-What noise?
-You keep shouting.

538
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:52,545
-Some of the lads are getting a bit peeved.
-What?

539
01:19:04,685 --> 01:19:09,355
-Christ. You look a bit rough.
-Thing is, I've decided to stay on for a bit.

540
01:19:10,475 --> 01:19:13,775
I'm meeting someone,
and I'm always keeping her waiting.

541
01:19:13,855 --> 01:19:17,445
Now, listen. Listen to me, guv'nor.

542
01:19:18,075 --> 01:19:22,325
I went out for a Jimmy Riddle just now.
Guess what I saw!

543
01:19:22,905 --> 01:19:26,115
They're getting themselves sorted out
down on the beach.

544
01:19:26,415 --> 01:19:31,205
The boats are back, and a geezer from
the Buffs is marching us down at 7:00.

545
01:19:32,165 --> 01:19:35,505
We're away. We're off home, mate.

546
01:19:38,005 --> 01:19:41,805
So get some more sleep, and no more
of your bleeding shouting.

547
01:19:41,885 --> 01:19:46,095
-All right?
-I won't say a word.

548
01:19:48,935 --> 01:19:51,775
Wake me before 7:00, would you?
Thanks so much.

549
01:19:54,145 --> 01:19:59,155
You won't hear another word
from me. Promise.

550
01:20:03,865 --> 01:20:07,495
London
Three weeks earlier

551
01:20:48,995 --> 01:20:51,625
Bed castors should be lined up
and pointing inwards.

552
01:20:51,705 --> 01:20:54,915
I found three yesterday that weren't.
You know who you are.

553
01:20:55,005 --> 01:20:57,335
Which of you were responsible
for putting away the blankets today?

554
01:20:57,415 --> 01:20:59,465
I was, Sister.
-I don't suppose you can tell us

555
01:20:59,545 --> 01:21:01,005
-what you did wrong?
-No, Sister.

556
01:21:01,085 --> 01:21:02,885
Labels are folded to the inside,
are they not?

557
01:21:02,965 --> 01:21:04,385
-Yes, Sister.
-Do them again.

558
01:21:04,465 --> 01:21:08,805
Nurse Tallis, I'll see you in my office.
The rest of you are excused.

559
01:21:21,735 --> 01:21:24,905
-ls this job at all important to you, Tallis?
-Very important, Sister.

560
01:21:24,985 --> 01:21:27,195
Yesterday, you were seconded
to men's surgical.

561
01:21:27,285 --> 01:21:30,285
When your patient came round from his
anaesthetic, it seems the first thing he did

562
01:21:30,365 --> 01:21:32,825
was to ask for Briony.
Who might Briony be?

563
01:21:32,915 --> 01:21:36,085
-Well, me, Sister.
-There is no Briony.

564
01:21:36,165 --> 01:21:39,625
You are Tallis. Nurse Tallis.
Is that understood?

565
01:21:39,715 --> 01:21:40,875
Yes, Sister.

566
01:21:51,015 --> 01:21:52,515
There is no Briony.

567
01:21:56,725 --> 01:22:00,315
This is the BBC
Home Service. Here is the news.

568
01:22:00,395 --> 01:22:03,865
The BEF, with their French allies,
are fighting a desperate battle

569
01:22:03,945 --> 01:22:06,285
in the northern zone of the Western Front.

570
01:22:06,365 --> 01:22:10,785
The Allied Forces have not lost
cohesion, and their morale is high.

571
01:22:10,865 --> 01:22:13,745
The RAF continues to give all the support
in its power

572
01:22:13,825 --> 01:22:17,085
to the Allied armies in northeastern
France and Belgium. Railways, roads,

573
01:22:17,165 --> 01:22:21,005
bridges and enemy troops have been
continuously attacked, yesterday...

574
01:22:38,315 --> 01:22:41,605
Thanks. I never could make the scissors
work with my left hand.

575
01:22:41,695 --> 01:22:43,815
Mummy always did it for me.

576
01:22:45,195 --> 01:22:46,985
There, you're done.

577
01:22:51,495 --> 01:22:52,575
Bother!

578
01:22:59,045 --> 01:23:00,085
Night-night, Ponty.

579
01:23:01,505 --> 01:23:03,295
Good night, Tallis.

580
01:23:18,605 --> 01:23:20,935
Don't panic! It's only me.

581
01:23:21,025 --> 01:23:24,735
Fiona, I almost jumped out of my skin.

582
01:23:25,525 --> 01:23:28,525
So this is where you duck to after lights out.

583
01:23:28,615 --> 01:23:32,825
I thought you might be in the middle
of some tempestuous romance.

584
01:23:33,205 --> 01:23:35,915
Don't you freeze to death up here?

585
01:23:38,335 --> 01:23:39,955
I love London.

586
01:23:41,665 --> 01:23:44,045
Do you think all of this will be
bombed and just disappear?

587
01:23:44,125 --> 01:23:45,215
No.

588
01:23:46,835 --> 01:23:48,425
I don't know.

589
01:23:49,345 --> 01:23:51,635
Do you write about Sister Drummond?

590
01:23:52,515 --> 01:23:54,845
-Do you write about me?
-Sometimes.

591
01:23:56,055 --> 01:23:59,565
-Can I look?
-I'd rather you didn't. It's private.

592
01:24:00,395 --> 01:24:04,025
I don't see any point in writing a story
if you're not going to let anyone read it.

593
01:24:04,105 --> 01:24:06,565
-It's not ready yet. It's unfinished.
-What's it about?

594
01:24:13,195 --> 01:24:16,205
-It's complicated.
-Yes?

595
01:24:16,285 --> 01:24:17,495
It's just...

596
01:24:19,955 --> 01:24:24,915
It's about a young girl, a young and
foolish girl, who sees something from

597
01:24:25,005 --> 01:24:29,545
her bedroom window which she doesn't
understand, but she thinks she does.

598
01:24:33,175 --> 01:24:35,345
I probably won't ever finish it.

599
01:24:35,975 --> 01:24:39,145
I look at you, Tallis,
and you're so mysterious.

600
01:24:39,805 --> 01:24:42,225
I've never been mysterious.

601
01:24:43,935 --> 01:24:46,735
-Do you know what I decided tonight?
-What?

602
01:24:49,195 --> 01:24:52,775
I could never marry a man
who wasn't in the Royal Navy.

603
01:25:02,455 --> 01:25:05,255
Here we are. Cecilia Tallis.

604
01:25:05,755 --> 01:25:07,925
I think this is her address.

605
01:25:09,965 --> 01:25:11,135
Thank you.

606
01:25:20,145 --> 01:25:23,895
Dear Cecilia. Please don't
throw this away without reading it.

607
01:25:25,025 --> 01:25:27,525
As you'll have seen from the
notepaper, I'm here at St Thomas'

608
01:25:27,605 --> 01:25:29,855
doing my nurses' training.

609
01:25:29,945 --> 01:25:32,445
I decided not to take up
my place at Cambridge.

610
01:25:32,525 --> 01:25:33,905
Oh, God.

611
01:25:35,575 --> 01:25:39,365
I decided I wanted to make myself useful.
Do something practical.

612
01:25:42,125 --> 01:25:45,165
It says in the newspaper
the Army are making strategic withdrawals.

613
01:25:45,245 --> 01:25:46,335
Yes, I saw that.

614
01:25:46,415 --> 01:25:48,465
It's a euphemism for retreat.

615
01:25:49,795 --> 01:25:53,505
No matter how hard I work,
no matter how long the hours,

616
01:25:54,425 --> 01:25:56,885
I can't escape from what I did

617
01:25:56,965 --> 01:26:00,015
and what it meant,

618
01:26:00,095 --> 01:26:03,805
the full extent of which
I am only now beginning to grasp.

619
01:26:10,775 --> 01:26:13,735
Cee, please write and tell me we can meet.

620
01:26:15,485 --> 01:26:17,325
Your sister, Briony.

621
01:26:19,655 --> 01:26:22,535
So do you?
-Do I what?

622
01:26:22,955 --> 01:26:27,245
Have a secret fiancé in France.
That's what everyone thinks.

623
01:26:27,335 --> 01:26:28,375
No, of course not.

624
01:26:28,455 --> 01:26:31,045
Imagine not knowing if he'd ever come back.

625
01:26:31,125 --> 01:26:33,295
I've never been in love.

626
01:26:34,045 --> 01:26:36,755
What, never? Not even a crush?

627
01:26:37,425 --> 01:26:40,885
Oh, I had a crush once, when I was 10 or 11.

628
01:26:43,095 --> 01:26:46,435
I jumped into a river to see
if he'd save me from drowning.

629
01:26:46,515 --> 01:26:50,025
-Now you're teasing me.
-Oh, no. And he did save me.

630
01:26:53,025 --> 01:26:56,695
But as soon as I told him I loved him,
the feeling sort of disappeared.

631
01:26:56,775 --> 01:26:58,365
Something's happened.

632
01:27:02,825 --> 01:27:04,325
Outside, quickly.

633
01:27:48,495 --> 01:27:49,745
Robbie.

634
01:27:53,795 --> 01:27:54,875
Excuse me.

635
01:28:44,555 --> 01:28:48,015
Nurse Tallis, you speak a little French,
if I remember rightly.

636
01:28:48,095 --> 01:28:49,345
Only school French, Sister.

637
01:28:49,435 --> 01:28:53,775
There's a soldier in Bed 13. Go and sit
with him for a minute. Hold his hand.

638
01:28:53,855 --> 01:28:54,985
Off you go.

639
01:29:48,955 --> 01:29:50,455
Here you are at last

640
01:29:51,325 --> 01:29:52,955
Sister sent me

641
01:29:53,035 --> 01:29:55,295
for a little chat

642
01:29:58,125 --> 01:30:00,375
I remember your sister

643
01:30:00,875 --> 01:30:03,425
she was always so nice

644
01:30:05,135 --> 01:30:06,715
what's she doing now?

645
01:30:08,595 --> 01:30:11,935
She is a nurse as well

646
01:30:12,975 --> 01:30:16,105
Did she finally marry that man
she was so in love with?

647
01:30:16,775 --> 01:30:18,185
I've forgotten his name

648
01:30:18,275 --> 01:30:19,355
Robbie?

649
01:30:21,105 --> 01:30:22,605
She will soon I hope

650
01:30:23,565 --> 01:30:24,655
Robbie

651
01:30:25,275 --> 01:30:27,115
yes that's right

652
01:30:29,405 --> 01:30:30,495
And you?

653
01:30:30,825 --> 01:30:32,365
What is your name?

654
01:30:34,585 --> 01:30:35,625
Luc.

655
01:30:37,125 --> 01:30:38,545
Luc Cornet.

656
01:30:40,755 --> 01:30:42,005
And you?

657
01:30:42,085 --> 01:30:43,175
Tallis.

658
01:30:44,595 --> 01:30:45,635
Tallis.

659
01:30:47,465 --> 01:30:49,385
That's pretty

660
01:30:54,305 --> 01:30:56,935
I remember you now

661
01:30:58,895 --> 01:31:01,025
the English girl

662
01:31:02,235 --> 01:31:05,025
You remember your first visit to Millau?

663
01:31:06,365 --> 01:31:08,905
I was working by the ovens with my father.

664
01:31:09,905 --> 01:31:12,075
I heard your accent

665
01:31:16,205 --> 01:31:18,955
Can you do me a little favour Tallis?

666
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:23,545
These bandages are so tight,

667
01:31:23,875 --> 01:31:27,005
can you loosen them a bit, please?

668
01:31:28,135 --> 01:31:29,555
Of course

669
01:31:37,435 --> 01:31:39,775
You remember my younger sister, Anne?

670
01:31:42,185 --> 01:31:45,235
She still plays that little Debussy piece

671
01:31:46,985 --> 01:31:48,405
do you remember?

672
01:31:50,785 --> 01:31:53,865
She looks so serious when she plays

673
01:31:54,995 --> 01:31:56,875
And our croissants,

674
01:31:57,495 --> 01:31:59,335
what did you think of them?

675
01:32:06,965 --> 01:32:09,135
The most delicious in Millau

676
01:32:09,555 --> 01:32:10,595
Yes.

677
01:32:10,805 --> 01:32:12,925
it's the quality of the butter

678
01:32:14,635 --> 01:32:15,685
Yes

679
01:32:19,185 --> 01:32:21,645
Is that why you came every day?

680
01:32:23,105 --> 01:32:24,695
Because you know,

681
01:32:26,655 --> 01:32:30,115
my mother is very fond of you

682
01:32:30,825 --> 01:32:32,535
in her opinion,

683
01:32:33,035 --> 01:32:35,785
we should get married in the summer

684
01:32:36,155 --> 01:32:37,615
Oh yes?

685
01:32:37,875 --> 01:32:39,375
Yes

686
01:32:47,335 --> 01:32:49,715
I hope that's more comfortable

687
01:32:54,635 --> 01:32:55,675
Do you love me?

688
01:32:55,765 --> 01:32:57,765
Yes

689
01:33:06,145 --> 01:33:08,605
Can you stay a while?

690
01:33:10,115 --> 01:33:13,155
I'm frightened

691
01:33:22,495 --> 01:33:24,125
-Tallis.
-Briony.

692
01:33:25,875 --> 01:33:27,665
Je m'appelle Briony.

693
01:33:39,515 --> 01:33:41,605
Stand up, Nurse Tallis.

694
01:33:46,565 --> 01:33:49,315
Now go and wash the blood off your face.

695
01:34:51,165 --> 01:34:56,135
The Navy has earned our
undying gratitude. The Army is undefeated.

696
01:34:56,215 --> 01:34:59,975
Courage has brought them through
unconquered, their spirit unbowed.

697
01:35:00,055 --> 01:35:02,135
This is the epic of Dunkirk.

698
01:35:02,225 --> 01:35:06,475
A name that will live forever
in the annals of warfare.

699
01:35:10,235 --> 01:35:12,445
In the course of a comprehensive tour,

700
01:35:12,525 --> 01:35:16,275
Queen Elizabeth is seen here visiting
a chocolate factory in the north of England.

701
01:35:16,365 --> 01:35:18,695
The confectionary magnate
and friend of the British Army,

702
01:35:18,785 --> 01:35:23,035
Mr Paul Marshall, gave the Queen a tour
of the Army Amo factory

703
01:35:23,115 --> 01:35:27,495
with his lovely,
soon-to-be-wed fiancée, Miss Lola Quincey.

704
01:35:27,585 --> 01:35:30,335
What a mouthwatering couple they are.

705
01:35:30,455 --> 01:35:34,005
Keep the Amo coming.
Our boys have a sweet tooth.

706
01:36:01,615 --> 01:36:07,575
Secondly, for a remedy against sin,
and to avoid fornication,

707
01:36:07,665 --> 01:36:11,545
that such persons
as have not the gift of continence,

708
01:36:11,625 --> 01:36:17,215
might marry and keep themselves
undefiled members of Christ's body.

709
01:36:18,045 --> 01:36:23,265
Thirdly, it was ordained,
for the mutual society, help and comfort,

710
01:36:23,345 --> 01:36:26,895
that the one ought to have the other.

711
01:36:26,975 --> 01:36:28,105
I saw him.

712
01:36:28,185 --> 01:36:32,105
Therefore, if any man can show
any just cause

713
01:36:32,185 --> 01:36:35,145
why they may not be
lawfully joined together...

714
01:36:35,315 --> 01:36:36,355
I know it was him.

715
01:36:36,605 --> 01:36:42,075
...Iet him now speak
or forever hold his peace.

716
01:36:48,665 --> 01:36:51,375
I saw him. I saw him with my own eyes.

717
01:37:33,795 --> 01:37:35,505
Let the nursey through.

718
01:37:35,585 --> 01:37:38,085
They're going down to the country today.
Never been out of London before.

719
01:37:38,175 --> 01:37:39,375
I hope they get a nice family.

720
01:37:39,465 --> 01:37:41,715
They don't know what they're in for
with this lot.

721
01:37:41,795 --> 01:37:42,885
Come on.

722
01:38:00,985 --> 01:38:04,075
I'm looking for Miss Tallis. Cecilia Tallis.

723
01:38:05,485 --> 01:38:06,575
Is she in?

724
01:38:12,705 --> 01:38:15,205
Tallis! Door!

725
01:38:23,005 --> 01:38:25,255
I tried writing. You wouldn't answer.

726
01:38:30,265 --> 01:38:32,145
I have to talk to you.

727
01:38:56,795 --> 01:38:59,165
-So you're a ward sister now?
-Yes.

728
01:39:12,555 --> 01:39:13,645
Thanks.

729
01:39:23,025 --> 01:39:25,065
I want to go in front of a judge
and change my evidence, Cee.

730
01:39:25,155 --> 01:39:26,865
Don't call me that.

731
01:39:32,495 --> 01:39:34,495
Please don't call me that.

732
01:39:37,455 --> 01:39:39,835
I know what I did was terrible.
I don't expect you to forgive me.

733
01:39:39,915 --> 01:39:41,965
Oh, don't worry, I won't.

734
01:39:44,085 --> 01:39:46,635
You're an unreliable witness.
They'll never reopen the case.

735
01:39:46,715 --> 01:39:48,465
Well, at least
I could tell everyone else what I did.

736
01:39:48,555 --> 01:39:50,965
I can go home and explain
to Mummy and Daddy and Leon...

737
01:39:51,055 --> 01:39:53,305
-So what's stopping you?
-Well, I wanted to see you first.

738
01:39:53,385 --> 01:39:55,595
They don't want to hear any more about it.

739
01:39:55,685 --> 01:39:58,895
That unpleasantness is all tidied away
in the past, thank you very much.

740
01:39:58,975 --> 01:40:00,105
But...

741
01:40:08,115 --> 01:40:10,365
I'll be late. Better get moving.

742
01:40:13,905 --> 01:40:15,245
Excuse me.

743
01:40:21,625 --> 01:40:23,505
He sleeps so deeply.

744
01:41:23,775 --> 01:41:27,105
-What is she doing here?
-She wanted to speak to me.

745
01:41:27,195 --> 01:41:29,065
Oh, yes, what about?

746
01:41:29,155 --> 01:41:30,525
The terrible thing I did.

747
01:41:30,615 --> 01:41:32,115
Robbie. Darling.

748
01:41:36,115 --> 01:41:38,115
I'll be quite honest with you.

749
01:41:38,205 --> 01:41:39,665
I'm torn between breaking your neck here

750
01:41:39,745 --> 01:41:42,745
and taking you
and throwing you down the stairs.

751
01:41:42,835 --> 01:41:43,955
Oh, God.

752
01:41:44,045 --> 01:41:48,125
Do you have any idea what it's like in jail?
Of course, you don't.

753
01:41:48,505 --> 01:41:51,085
Tell me, did it give you pleasure
to think of me inside?

754
01:41:51,175 --> 01:41:53,005
-No.
-But you did nothing about it.

755
01:41:53,095 --> 01:41:54,805
-No.
-Do you think I assaulted your cousin?

756
01:41:54,885 --> 01:41:55,965
-No.
-Did you think it then?

757
01:41:56,055 --> 01:41:57,135
Yes. But yes and no.

758
01:41:57,225 --> 01:41:59,135
-And what's made you so certain now?
-Growing up.

759
01:41:59,225 --> 01:42:00,765
-Growing up?
-I was 13.

760
01:42:00,845 --> 01:42:04,015
How old do you have to be to know
the difference between right and wrong?

761
01:42:04,105 --> 01:42:05,525
What are you, 18?

762
01:42:05,605 --> 01:42:08,485
Do you have to be 18 before
you can bring yourself to own up to a lie?

763
01:42:08,565 --> 01:42:12,655
There are soldiers of 18, old enough
to be left to die by the side of the road,

764
01:42:12,735 --> 01:42:14,155
-did you know that?
-Yes.

765
01:42:14,235 --> 01:42:16,535
Five years ago,
you didn't care about telling the truth.

766
01:42:16,615 --> 01:42:19,955
You, all your family, you just assumed
that for all my education,

767
01:42:20,035 --> 01:42:23,165
I was still little better than a servant.
Still not to be trusted!

768
01:42:23,245 --> 01:42:26,295
Thanks to you, they were able to close ranks
and throw me to the fucking wolves!

769
01:42:26,375 --> 01:42:29,375
-Robbie! Look at me, look at me.
-Don't!

770
01:42:29,465 --> 01:42:33,095
Come back. Come back.

771
01:42:35,635 --> 01:42:37,885
Come back to me.

772
01:43:01,915 --> 01:43:02,995
Briony.

773
01:43:04,875 --> 01:43:06,585
There isn't much time.

774
01:43:07,835 --> 01:43:11,585
Robbie has to report for duty at 6:00,
and he's got a train to catch.

775
01:43:13,255 --> 01:43:14,595
So sit down.

776
01:43:20,515 --> 01:43:23,265
There are some things
you're going to do for us.

777
01:43:40,075 --> 01:43:41,825
You'll go to your parents
as soon as you can,

778
01:43:41,905 --> 01:43:43,285
and you'll tell them everything
they need to know

779
01:43:43,365 --> 01:43:46,415
to be convinced
that the evidence you gave was false.

780
01:43:46,495 --> 01:43:48,165
You'll meet with a solicitor,
make a statement,

781
01:43:48,245 --> 01:43:50,415
have it signed, witnessed,
send copies to us. Is that clear?

782
01:43:50,505 --> 01:43:51,625
Yes.

783
01:43:51,715 --> 01:43:54,545
You'll write a detailed letter to me
explaining everything that happened

784
01:43:54,635 --> 01:43:56,635
leading up to you saying
you saw me by the lake.

785
01:43:56,715 --> 01:43:57,965
Try to include whatever you can remember

786
01:43:58,055 --> 01:43:59,845
of what Danny Hardman was doing
that night.

787
01:43:59,925 --> 01:44:01,175
-Hardman?
-Yes.

788
01:44:04,385 --> 01:44:06,055
It wasn't Danny Hardman.

789
01:44:06,935 --> 01:44:08,935
It was Leon's friend, Marshall.

790
01:44:09,775 --> 01:44:10,855
I don't believe you.

791
01:44:10,935 --> 01:44:14,195
He's married Lola.
I've just come from their wedding.

792
01:44:20,195 --> 01:44:22,865
Lola won't be able to testify
against him now.

793
01:44:25,285 --> 01:44:26,705
He's immune.

794
01:44:42,465 --> 01:44:47,225
I'm very, very sorry for the terrible distress
that I have caused.

795
01:44:49,225 --> 01:44:51,475
I am very, very sorry.

796
01:44:52,025 --> 01:44:54,025
Just do as we've asked of you.

797
01:44:54,395 --> 01:44:58,865
Write it all down, just the truth, no rhymes.
No embellishments, no adjectives.

798
01:45:00,615 --> 01:45:02,365
And then leave us be.

799
01:45:04,285 --> 01:45:05,705
I will, I promise.

800
01:46:08,515 --> 01:46:10,725
I'm sorry.
Could we stop for a moment?

801
01:46:12,105 --> 01:46:13,725
Of course. Is something the matter?

802
01:46:13,815 --> 01:46:17,065
I just need a couple of minutes by myself.

803
01:46:19,445 --> 01:46:21,275
...minutes by myself.

804
01:46:22,695 --> 01:46:28,075
Briony Tallis, your new novel,
your twenty-first, is called Atonement. It's...

805
01:46:29,955 --> 01:46:31,035
Briony?

806
01:46:36,255 --> 01:46:38,465
I'm sorry. Could we stop for a moment?

807
01:47:13,705 --> 01:47:17,875
Briony Tallis, I'd like to talk now
about your new novel, Atonement,

808
01:47:17,955 --> 01:47:21,545
which comes out in a few days
to coincide with your birthday.

809
01:47:22,125 --> 01:47:26,555
-It's your twenty-first novel...
-It's my last novel.

810
01:47:28,095 --> 01:47:30,675
Oh, really? Are you retiring?

811
01:47:31,885 --> 01:47:33,225
I'm dying.

812
01:47:35,435 --> 01:47:39,645
My doctor tells me
I have something called vascular dementia,

813
01:47:41,275 --> 01:47:44,355
which is essentially
a continuous series of tiny strokes.

814
01:47:44,445 --> 01:47:50,075
Your brain closes down, gradually
you lose words, you lose your memory,

815
01:47:50,155 --> 01:47:53,205
which for a writer is pretty much the point.

816
01:47:56,035 --> 01:48:00,665
So that's why I could finally write the book,
I think. I had to.

817
01:48:01,505 --> 01:48:03,835
And why, of course, it's my last novel.

818
01:48:07,045 --> 01:48:08,595
Strangely enough,

819
01:48:13,475 --> 01:48:17,805
it would be just as accurate
to call it my first novel.

820
01:48:18,975 --> 01:48:24,195
I wrote several drafts as far back as my time
at St Thomas' Hospital during the War.

821
01:48:24,985 --> 01:48:27,485
I just couldn't ever find the way to do it.

822
01:48:28,275 --> 01:48:30,735
Because the novel is autobiographical,
is that right?

823
01:48:30,825 --> 01:48:34,325
Yes, entirely. I haven't changed any names,
including my own.

824
01:48:34,405 --> 01:48:36,245
And was that the problem?

825
01:48:37,575 --> 01:48:38,705
No.

826
01:48:39,585 --> 01:48:44,335
I had, for a very long time,
decided to tell the absolute truth.

827
01:48:45,835 --> 01:48:48,005
No rhymes, no embellishments.

828
01:48:57,015 --> 01:48:58,355
And I think...

829
01:49:01,395 --> 01:49:04,025
You've read the book,
you'll understand why.

830
01:49:06,025 --> 01:49:10,275
I got first-hand accounts of all the events
I didn't personally witness,

831
01:49:10,905 --> 01:49:15,865
the conditions in prison,
the evacuation to Dunkirk, everything.

832
01:49:17,365 --> 01:49:20,585
But the effect of all this honesty
was rather pitiless.

833
01:49:20,665 --> 01:49:26,755
You see, I couldn't any longer imagine
what purpose would be served by it.

834
01:49:28,255 --> 01:49:30,845
By what? Sorry. Served by honesty?

835
01:49:30,925 --> 01:49:32,055
By honesty.

836
01:49:33,425 --> 01:49:34,765
Or reality.

837
01:49:40,225 --> 01:49:42,105
Because, in fact,

838
01:49:43,435 --> 01:49:48,155
I was too much of a coward
to go and see my sister in June, 1940.

839
01:49:49,945 --> 01:49:51,735
I never made that journey to Balham.

840
01:49:51,825 --> 01:49:53,485
Do you have any idea
what it's like in jail?

841
01:49:53,575 --> 01:49:55,615
So the scene in which
I confess to them is imagined.

842
01:49:55,695 --> 01:49:56,825
He sleeps so deeply.

843
01:49:56,905 --> 01:49:57,955
Invented.

844
01:49:58,035 --> 01:50:00,955
How old do you have to be to know
the difference between right and wrong?

845
01:50:01,035 --> 01:50:03,495
And, in fact,
could never have happened.

846
01:50:03,585 --> 01:50:04,665
Because

847
01:50:07,085 --> 01:50:12,005
Robbie Turner died of septicaemia
at Bray-Dunes

848
01:50:13,135 --> 01:50:15,465
on June the first, 1940,

849
01:50:16,515 --> 01:50:18,595
the last day of the evacuation.

850
01:50:23,475 --> 01:50:24,685
Cheerio, pal.

851
01:50:58,515 --> 01:51:02,555
And I was never able to put things right
with my sister, Cecilia,

852
01:51:04,305 --> 01:51:08,895
because she was killed
on the 15th of October, 1940,

853
01:51:09,235 --> 01:51:13,565
by the bomb that destroyed the gas
and water mains above Balham tube station.

854
01:51:50,315 --> 01:51:51,395
So...

855
01:51:53,945 --> 01:51:57,655
My sister and Robbie were never able
to have the time together

856
01:51:59,235 --> 01:52:03,365
they both so longed for, and deserved.

857
01:52:05,165 --> 01:52:08,045
And which, ever since, I've...

858
01:52:13,125 --> 01:52:17,385
Ever since I've always felt I prevented.

859
01:52:23,975 --> 01:52:27,105
But what sense of hope,

860
01:52:28,685 --> 01:52:33,145
or satisfaction, could a reader derive
from an ending like that?

861
01:52:33,985 --> 01:52:40,535
So, in the book, I wanted to give Robbie
and Cecilia what they lost out on in life.

862
01:52:41,905 --> 01:52:47,165
I'd like to think
this isn't weakness or evasion,

863
01:52:49,795 --> 01:52:51,915
but a final act of kindness.

864
01:52:53,715 --> 01:53:00,465
I gave them their happiness.
