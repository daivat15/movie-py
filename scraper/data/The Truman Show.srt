1
00:00:19,836 --> 00:00:24,340
We've become bored with watching
actors give us phony emotions.

2
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:28,803
We're tired of pyrotechnics
and special effects.

3
00:00:29,346 --> 00:00:34,183
While the world he inhabits is,
in some respects, counterfeit,

4
00:00:35,143 --> 00:00:38,062
there's nothing fake about
Truman himself.

5
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:41,357
No scripts, no cue cards.

6
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,194
Lt isn't always Shakespeare,
but it's genuine.

7
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:47,363
Lt's a life.

8
00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:53,160
L'm not going to make it.

9
00:00:54,663 --> 00:00:56,372
You're going to have to go on
without me.

10
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:03,212
No way, mister.

11
00:01:04,047 --> 00:01:07,883
You're going to the top of this mountain,
broken legs and all.

12
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:15,558
We find many viewers leave him on
all night for comfort.

13
00:01:17,394 --> 00:01:19,562
You're crazy, you know that?

14
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:26,986
For me, there is no difference
between a private life and a public life.

15
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,406
My life, is my life, is The Truman Show.

16
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,825
The Truman Show is a lifestyle.

17
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:35,244
Lt's a noble life. lt is

18
00:01:38,123 --> 00:01:39,707
a truly blessed life.

19
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:42,418
Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

20
00:01:43,795 --> 00:01:46,547
All right. Promise me one thing, though.

21
00:01:47,257 --> 00:01:49,842
Lf I die before I reach the summit,

22
00:01:50,802 --> 00:01:53,888
you'll use me
as an alternative source of food.

23
00:01:54,973 --> 00:01:56,056
Gross.

24
00:01:59,561 --> 00:02:01,770
Lt's all true. lt's all real.

25
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,691
Nothing here is fake.
Nothing you see on this show is fake.

26
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:07,443
Lt's merely controlled.

27
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:18,662
Eat me, damn it. That's an order.

28
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,792
Maybe just your love handles.

29
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:28,339
L have love handles? Yeah. Little ones.

30
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:31,091
Truman. You're going to be late.

31
00:02:31,676 --> 00:02:33,344
Okay!

32
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,360
- Good morning.
- Morning.

33
00:02:49,444 --> 00:02:50,611
Good morning.

34
00:02:50,695 --> 00:02:54,990
Ln case I don't see you, good afternoon,
good evening, and good night.

35
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:57,243
Yeah.

36
00:02:57,327 --> 00:02:59,245
- Morning, Truman.
- Morning, Spencer.

37
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:01,121
Hey, Pluto. No, get down.

38
00:03:01,206 --> 00:03:02,957
- He won't hurt you.
- Get down.

39
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,583
L know.

40
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:06,961
- lt's just me.
- Come on, Pluto.

41
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,526
What is it?

42
00:03:51,673 --> 00:03:55,926
Here's a news flash just in. An aircraft
in trouble began shedding parts

43
00:03:56,011 --> 00:03:59,096
as it flew over Seahaven
just a few moments ago.

44
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,889
Luckily, no one was hurt.

45
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,058
But, hey, how do you feel today?

46
00:04:03,393 --> 00:04:05,477
That's good.
You thinking of flying somewhere?

47
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:07,104
- Nope.
- No? Good.

48
00:04:07,188 --> 00:04:09,273
This is Classical Clive
with Classical Drive

49
00:04:09,357 --> 00:04:11,692
so why don't you forget
about the perils of flying,

50
00:04:11,776 --> 00:04:14,778
settle back,
and let this music calm you down?

51
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,577
- Dog Fancy, please.
- Dog Fancy.

52
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,496
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

53
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:27,416
Give me a paper there, will you, Earl?

54
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,461
And one of these for the wife.

55
00:04:30,545 --> 00:04:32,338
Loves her fashion mags.

56
00:04:32,422 --> 00:04:33,964
Will that be all for you, Truman?

57
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:36,425
- That's the whole kit and caboodle.
- Catch you later.

58
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,552
Okay. Yeah.

59
00:04:45,602 --> 00:04:47,061
Good morning.

60
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:50,230
- Hank.
- Morning, Truman.

61
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:53,776
- Good morning, Truman.
- How are you guys?

62
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,111
- Beautiful day, isn't it?
- Always.

63
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:57,821
And how's your lovely wife?

64
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,824
Good. How about yours?

65
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:03,410
- Couldn't be better.
- Fine.

66
00:05:03,495 --> 00:05:05,329
- Nice talking to you, Truman.
- You, too.

67
00:05:05,413 --> 00:05:06,538
We must go now.

68
00:05:06,623 --> 00:05:10,250
Think about that policy. Okay,
that's two for one. That's a good deal.

69
00:05:10,335 --> 00:05:12,544
- Doppelgänger special.
- Right.

70
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:13,796
Hi.

71
00:05:16,424 --> 00:05:19,009
Hey, fellows. You going in? Go ahead.

72
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:22,388
- Go ahead.
- No, you first, please.

73
00:05:22,514 --> 00:05:24,640
L'm not that anxious to get there.

74
00:05:39,614 --> 00:05:40,781
Yes, hello.

75
00:05:40,865 --> 00:05:44,410
Could I have directory assistance
for Fiji, please? Fiji islands.

76
00:05:44,494 --> 00:05:45,911
Truman, did you see this?

77
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,873
L'm sorry, ma'am.

78
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,960
Lf he's in a coma,
he's probably uninsurable.

79
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:57,089
Hello? Yes. Fiji, please.

80
00:05:57,465 --> 00:06:00,259
Do you have a listing for
Lauren Garland?

81
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:03,011
Nothing listed?

82
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:07,182
Okay. Do you have a Sylvia Garland?

83
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,851
"S" for Sylvia.

84
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:11,562
Nothing?

85
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:15,149
Okay. Thank you.

86
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:52,936
- Lawrence.
- Hey, Burbank.

87
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:56,440
Got a prospect in Wells Park
l need you to close.

88
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,235
Wells Park?

89
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:06,366
- On Harbor lsland?
- You know another one?

90
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:10,287
L can't do it.
L have an appointment. Dentist.

91
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:16,460
You're going to lose a lot more than
your teeth if you don't meet your quota.

92
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:18,128
Look, Truman,

93
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:20,839
they're making cutbacks
at the end of this month.

94
00:07:20,924 --> 00:07:23,425
- Cutbacks?
- Yeah. Now, you need this.

95
00:07:24,135 --> 00:07:28,555
Besides, a half-hour across the bay,
a little sea air would do you good.

96
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:31,141
Thanks.

97
00:07:40,652 --> 00:07:41,818
Hello.

98
00:07:41,903 --> 00:07:45,072
Ferry's still here.
Thought I might have missed it.

99
00:07:45,406 --> 00:07:47,074
One-way or return?

100
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,368
Return.

101
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,539
There you go, sir.

102
00:08:51,306 --> 00:08:54,850
- Do you need any help, sir?
- You go ahead. I'll be fine.

103
00:08:56,477 --> 00:08:57,686
Yeah.

104
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,534
Hi, honey.

105
00:09:14,203 --> 00:09:16,705
Look what I got free at the checkout.

106
00:09:17,874 --> 00:09:21,460
Lt's a Chef's Pal.
Lt's a dicer, grater, peeler, all in one.

107
00:09:21,544 --> 00:09:24,296
Never needs sharpening,
dishwasher-safe.

108
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,380
Wow!

109
00:09:26,507 --> 00:09:28,050
That's amazing.

110
00:09:29,218 --> 00:09:30,469
Truman,

111
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:33,680
you missed a spot.

112
00:09:47,904 --> 00:09:49,446
That is a beer.

113
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:54,117
You know, l'm thinking
about getting out, Marlon.

114
00:09:54,202 --> 00:09:56,119
Yeah? Out of what?

115
00:09:56,412 --> 00:09:58,747
Out of my job, out of Seahaven.

116
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,667
- Off this island. Out.
- Out of your job?

117
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:04,836
What the hell's wrong with your job?
You have a great job, Truman.

118
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:08,340
You have a desk job.
L'd kill for a desk job.

119
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,386
Here you go.

120
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,888
You should try stocking
vending machines for a living.

121
00:10:14,972 --> 00:10:17,599
- No, thanks.
- Now there's excitement.

122
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:20,894
Don't you ever get antsy? ltchy feet?

123
00:10:22,438 --> 00:10:24,231
Where's there to go?

124
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:27,192
Fiji.

125
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:31,238
Where the hell's Fiji? Near Florida?

126
00:10:36,828 --> 00:10:38,203
- See here?
- Yeah.

127
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:39,746
This is us,

128
00:10:41,749 --> 00:10:43,959
and all the way around here,

129
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:45,627
Fiji.

130
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:50,298
You can't get any further away
before you start coming back.

131
00:10:50,508 --> 00:10:53,260
You know, there are still islands in Fiji

132
00:10:53,344 --> 00:10:55,387
where no human being
has ever set foot.

133
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,767
So when are you going to go?

134
00:11:03,354 --> 00:11:05,147
Lt's not that simple.

135
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,316
Lt takes money,

136
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:10,610
planning.

137
00:11:11,112 --> 00:11:12,988
L can't just up and go.

138
00:11:13,823 --> 00:11:14,990
Right.

139
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,618
L'm going to do it.
Don't worry about that.

140
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:21,913
Bonus time is just around the corner.

141
00:11:26,627 --> 00:11:29,921
- You coming for a drink?
- No, I can't tonight.

142
00:11:49,358 --> 00:11:52,819
L don't like the look of that weather, son.
L think we should head back.

143
00:11:52,904 --> 00:11:55,447
- No, Dad. Not yet.
- No, come on. We should go back.

144
00:11:55,531 --> 00:11:58,074
- A bit farther, please?
- Son, listen.

145
00:11:58,534 --> 00:12:00,368
- Okay.
- Yes.

146
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,206
Daddy!

147
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,783
You're soaked. Where have you been?

148
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:24,077
L figure we can
scrape together $8,000...

149
00:13:24,161 --> 00:13:25,537
Every time you and Marlon
get together...

150
00:13:25,621 --> 00:13:27,706
We can bum around the world
for a year on that.

151
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,543
And then what, Truman?
We'd be where we were five years ago.

152
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:36,089
- You're talking like a teenager.
- Maybe I feel like a teenager.

153
00:13:36,674 --> 00:13:39,134
We have mortgage payments, Truman.

154
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:40,802
We have car payments.

155
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:44,014
What, we're just going to walk away
from our financial obligations?

156
00:13:44,098 --> 00:13:46,099
Lt would be an adventure.

157
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,229
L thought we were going to try for a
baby. lsn't that enough of an adventure?

158
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:54,649
That can wait. I want to get away.

159
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:57,485
See some of the world, explore.

160
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,488
Honey, you want to be an explorer?

161
00:14:01,866 --> 00:14:03,325
This'll pass.

162
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,953
We all think like this now and then.

163
00:14:09,373 --> 00:14:12,167
Let's get you out of these wet clothes,

164
00:14:12,668 --> 00:14:14,085
come to bed.

165
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:18,381
You never see anything anyway.
They always

166
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:21,384
turn the camera and play music and,

167
00:14:21,844 --> 00:14:24,596
you know, the wind blows in,
and the curtains move

168
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,097
and you don't see anything.

169
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,355
- Dog Fancy, please.
- Dog Fancy.

170
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:35,941
Thank you.

171
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,986
- Paper, Earl, please.
- Paper.

172
00:14:41,572 --> 00:14:44,950
L might as well pick one of these up
while l'm at it.

173
00:14:45,076 --> 00:14:47,702
- For the wife?
- She's got to have them.

174
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:51,373
- Anything else, Truman?
- That's the whole ball of wax.

175
00:14:51,874 --> 00:14:53,792
- Catch you later.
- Okay.

176
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:15,730
Dad?

177
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:20,777
What are you doing?

178
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:24,114
What the... Get out of the way!

179
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:25,740
Stop them!

180
00:15:28,244 --> 00:15:29,911
Stop those people!

181
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,376
Open the doors!
Somebody, stop the bus!

182
00:15:36,794 --> 00:15:39,587
Stop the bus! Somebody, stop it!

183
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,674
Somebody, stop the bus!

184
00:15:56,147 --> 00:15:59,065
And wasn't it funny...

185
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:07,741
lt doesn't sound insane at all, Truman.

186
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:11,703
L see him 10 times a week
in 100 different faces.

187
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:15,707
L almost hugged a perfect stranger
in the salon last Thursday.

188
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:19,377
Lt was Dad. I swear.
Dressed like a homeless man.

189
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,379
And you know what else was strange?

190
00:16:21,464 --> 00:16:23,465
A businessman and a woman
with a little dog

191
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,176
came out of nowhere
and forced him onto a bus.

192
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,054
Lt's about time they cleaned up
the trash downtown

193
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:31,848
before we become
just like the rest of the country.

194
00:16:31,932 --> 00:16:34,476
They never found Dad's body.
Maybe somehow...

195
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,560
God!

196
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:38,938
L'm telling you, if it wasn't him,
it was his twin.

197
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,444
- Did Dad have a brother?
- Truman, you know perfectly well

198
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,199
that your father was an only child,
just like you.

199
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:53,453
Now, sweetie,

200
00:16:54,121 --> 00:16:57,290
you're just feeling bad
because of what happened.

201
00:16:58,542 --> 00:17:01,503
You, sailing off into that storm.

202
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:07,175
But l've never blamed you, Truman,

203
00:17:08,302 --> 00:17:10,345
and I don't blame you now.

204
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,809
Truman?

205
00:18:01,856 --> 00:18:04,065
What are you doing down here?

206
00:18:05,568 --> 00:18:07,193
Fixing the mower.

207
00:18:10,865 --> 00:18:13,074
- Saw my father today.
- L know.

208
00:18:16,412 --> 00:18:18,163
Your mother called.

209
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,792
You really shouldn't upset her like that.

210
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,461
Did you want... What did you want?

211
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,422
L made macaroni.

212
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,591
L'm not hungry.

213
00:18:30,426 --> 00:18:34,053
You know, you really ought to throw out
that mower.

214
00:18:35,222 --> 00:18:37,640
Get one of those new Elk Rotaries.

215
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,803
What's he doing?

216
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,890
See, they got rid of her,
but they couldn't erase the memory.

217
00:19:18,974 --> 00:19:20,642
The memory of who?

218
00:20:13,362 --> 00:20:15,697
- You okay? You all right?
- Excuse me. Hi.

219
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,032
- Hi.
- L'm so sorry I fell on you like that.

220
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:21,244
- lt's okay.
- L've just been such a klutz all day.

221
00:20:21,328 --> 00:20:22,829
Lt's all right.

222
00:20:22,913 --> 00:20:25,957
Sprained this ankle. Oh, my goodness.
L'm so sorry.

223
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:29,919
- l'm so sorry to fall on you like that.
- That's all right. Don't worry about it.

224
00:20:30,004 --> 00:20:32,380
- l'm Meryl.
- Hi, l'm Truman.

225
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:33,923
Hey, nice to meet you.

226
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:03,930
- Truman, you've studied enough.
- No. I got to commit this to memory.

227
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:05,973
Come on, Truman,
one ice-cold brewski.

228
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,308
Come on.

229
00:22:07,851 --> 00:22:11,145
You're going to have to copy off me,
so be careful.

230
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,775
You're a better person than I am.

231
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:17,110
- See you later.
- Okay.

232
00:22:17,194 --> 00:22:18,569
- Bye.
- Bye.

233
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:21,197
See you later, loser.

234
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,009
Hi.

235
00:23:27,931 --> 00:23:30,808
- Konnichi-wa.
- What?

236
00:23:31,435 --> 00:23:33,102
You take Japanese.

237
00:23:34,229 --> 00:23:35,563
Yes.

238
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,151
Lauren, right?

239
00:23:40,694 --> 00:23:41,861
Lt's on the...

240
00:23:43,572 --> 00:23:45,072
Lauren. Right.

241
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:48,242
L'm Truman Burbank.

242
00:23:48,744 --> 00:23:50,953
Yeah, I know.

243
00:23:51,914 --> 00:23:54,499
You know, Truman,
l'm not allowed to talk to you.

244
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:55,791
Really?

245
00:23:58,587 --> 00:24:02,215
Yeah. I can understand that.
L'm a pretty dangerous character.

246
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:04,509
L'm sorry. lt's not up to me.

247
00:24:05,385 --> 00:24:07,470
A girl's got to be careful.

248
00:24:10,307 --> 00:24:13,434
- You have a boyfriend, right?
- No, it's not that.

249
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,063
Was it Meryl, that girl that was with me?
We're not... We don't...

250
00:24:17,981 --> 00:24:19,565
We're just friends.

251
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,318
- lt's nothing like that.
- Lt's how I look?

252
00:24:22,402 --> 00:24:23,903
Not your type?

253
00:24:24,905 --> 00:24:25,947
No.

254
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:28,950
L like your pin.

255
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,286
L was wondering that myself.

256
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:36,290
Would you want to maybe, possibly,

257
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:40,336
sometime go out
for some pizza or something?

258
00:24:40,587 --> 00:24:42,046
Like, Friday?

259
00:24:43,173 --> 00:24:44,507
- Saturday?
- L can't.

260
00:24:44,591 --> 00:24:46,551
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday?

261
00:24:50,973 --> 00:24:53,641
- We have finals tomorrow.
- Yeah, I know.

262
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:57,311
Lf we don't go now, it won't happen.

263
00:24:58,313 --> 00:25:01,857
Do you understand?
So what do you want to do?

264
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:39,020
Please keep your hands inside the car!

265
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,789
This is my favorite pizza place.

266
00:25:58,874 --> 00:25:59,915
Tony!

267
00:26:00,042 --> 00:26:02,043
One large, extra plankton.

268
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:06,172
We have so little time.
They're going to be here any minute.

269
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:09,216
- Who are?
- They don't want me talking to you.

270
00:26:09,718 --> 00:26:11,344
Then don't talk.

271
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:27,068
They're here.

272
00:26:28,362 --> 00:26:29,904
- Truman.
- What do they want?

273
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:32,114
Listen to me.
Everybody knows about you.

274
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:33,908
Everybody knows everything you do.

275
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,993
They're pretending, Truman.
Do you understand?

276
00:26:36,078 --> 00:26:37,679
- Everybody's pretending.
- L don't know.

277
00:26:37,746 --> 00:26:39,664
No, my name's not Lauren. lt's Sylvia.

278
00:26:39,748 --> 00:26:41,040
- My name's Sylvia.
- Sylvia?

279
00:26:41,124 --> 00:26:43,501
- Yeah.
- Lauren, sweetheart, not again.

280
00:26:43,585 --> 00:26:46,504
- Wait a minute. Who are you?
- L'm her father.

281
00:26:46,755 --> 00:26:49,507
- l've never even seen him before.
- We weren't doing anything.

282
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:52,343
He's lying.
Truman, please don't listen to him.

283
00:26:52,427 --> 00:26:57,181
Everything l've told you is the truth.
This, it's fake. lt's all for you.

284
00:26:57,265 --> 00:27:00,101
- l don't understand.
- The sky and sea, everything, it's a set.

285
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:01,185
Lt's a show.

286
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:03,646
Everybody's watching you.
Please don't listen to him.

287
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,856
He's going to lie to you.
They're watching us now.

288
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:08,943
- l want to know what's going on.
- Schizophrenia. She has episodes.

289
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,361
We've tried everything.

290
00:27:10,445 --> 00:27:13,781
Hypnotism, shock therapy. Don't worry.

291
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,908
- Truman!
- You're not the first.

292
00:27:15,992 --> 00:27:19,370
You're not the first. She brings
all her boyfriends down here.

293
00:27:19,454 --> 00:27:22,039
What's he saying? Truman, he's lying.

294
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:25,292
- Get out of here. Come and find me.
- Don't worry.

295
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:28,838
We're going to Fiji.
Fiji. We're moving to Fiji.

296
00:27:28,922 --> 00:27:30,005
Fiji?

297
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:43,185
Sylvia!

298
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,270
Hey!

299
00:27:53,864 --> 00:27:56,323
Why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?

300
00:27:56,408 --> 00:28:00,870
His mother got sick, really sick.
He couldn't leave her. He's kind.

301
00:28:00,954 --> 00:28:02,705
Maybe he's too kind.

302
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,916
L can't believe he married Meryl
on the rebound.

303
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:07,334
Excuse me.

304
00:28:07,461 --> 00:28:08,711
Come on, Sal.

305
00:28:08,795 --> 00:28:11,881
We've already got this
on the greatest hits tape.

306
00:28:11,965 --> 00:28:13,007
Can I borrow that?

307
00:29:00,055 --> 00:29:01,972
Close, but no cigar.

308
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:33,003
And it's another beautiful day
in paradise, folks,

309
00:29:33,088 --> 00:29:35,840
but don't forget to buckle up
out there in radioland.

310
00:29:35,924 --> 00:29:38,050
Remember, a good driver...

311
00:29:46,893 --> 00:29:48,519
wait for the cue.

312
00:29:50,313 --> 00:29:51,814
Stand by, one.

313
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,233
Countdown to action.

314
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,860
Stand by, one.

315
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:01,907
He's heading west on Stewart.
Stand by, all extras.

316
00:30:01,992 --> 00:30:06,328
He'll be on you in about 90 seconds.
Props, make sure the coffee's hot.

317
00:30:06,454 --> 00:30:09,623
Okay, he's making his turn
onto Lancaster Square.

318
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,961
Oh, my God! He nearly hit her.

319
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:16,213
Something's wrong.
Change frequencies.

320
00:30:21,595 --> 00:30:23,304
Sorry about that, folks.

321
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:25,723
L guess we picked up
a police frequency or something.

322
00:30:25,807 --> 00:30:28,726
Lt sometimes happens,
and it can drive you crazy.

323
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,936
Okay, it's Classical Clive back in here

324
00:30:31,021 --> 00:30:33,564
and we've still got
some great music up ahead,

325
00:30:33,648 --> 00:30:34,899
but don't forget to buckle up.

326
00:30:34,983 --> 00:30:37,610
Remember safety.
A good driver is a safe driver.

327
00:30:37,694 --> 00:30:39,820
A safe driver is what? Yes...

328
00:30:55,795 --> 00:30:57,338
Morning, ma'am.

329
00:32:37,105 --> 00:32:39,440
- l love that idea.
- Lt's pretty cool, isn't it?

330
00:33:43,963 --> 00:33:45,172
Can I help?

331
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:47,633
Yeah. I have an appointment
at Gable Enterprises.

332
00:33:47,717 --> 00:33:49,176
They went bust.

333
00:33:54,307 --> 00:33:56,391
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

334
00:33:56,476 --> 00:33:59,603
- Just tell me what's happening.
- Got to go, sir. We're remodeling.

335
00:33:59,687 --> 00:34:01,688
No, you're not.
What are those people doing?

336
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,482
Lt's none of your business!

337
00:34:03,566 --> 00:34:06,026
Lf you don't tell me what's happening,
l'll report you!

338
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:07,861
You're trespassing.

339
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:40,352
Marlon.

340
00:34:40,895 --> 00:34:43,647
- Truman. What are you doing here?
- L got to talk to you.

341
00:34:43,731 --> 00:34:45,607
Lt's a bad time, okay? l'm way behind.

342
00:34:45,692 --> 00:34:48,235
L'm onto something, Marlon.
Something big.

343
00:34:48,361 --> 00:34:51,405
- You okay? You look like shit.
- L think l'm mixed up in something.

344
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:52,531
Mixed up in what?

345
00:34:52,615 --> 00:34:54,366
There's no point trying to explain it,

346
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:57,578
but a lot of strange things
have been happening.

347
00:35:00,957 --> 00:35:04,668
The people on the elevator.
There was no backing on it.

348
00:35:04,752 --> 00:35:07,296
L looked out. There was people there.

349
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,591
And on the radio on the way to work,
it starts following me along,

350
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,384
talking about everything that l'm doing.

351
00:35:12,468 --> 00:35:15,137
- Know what I mean?
- Truman, this is one of your fantasies...

352
00:35:15,221 --> 00:35:16,638
l think this is about my dad.

353
00:35:16,723 --> 00:35:18,932
- Your dad?
- L think he's alive.

354
00:35:19,767 --> 00:35:23,812
Yeah. I'll tell you about it later.
L'm definitely being followed.

355
00:35:24,272 --> 00:35:25,314
Who?

356
00:35:27,108 --> 00:35:30,569
Lt's hard to tell.
They look just like regular people.

357
00:35:33,907 --> 00:35:37,492
- How about those two?
- L don't know. Could be.

358
00:35:38,494 --> 00:35:42,289
Lt's when l'm unpredictable, that's...
They can't, you know.

359
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:46,084
- Did anything happen?
- No.

360
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,378
We gotta get out of here.
You ready to go?

361
00:35:48,463 --> 00:35:50,339
- No. I just came here.
- Come on.

362
00:35:50,423 --> 00:35:52,132
L told you I can't.

363
00:35:55,803 --> 00:35:58,305
You're going to get both our asses fired,
you know that?

364
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:00,557
- Okay, man, let's do it.
- What?

365
00:36:00,642 --> 00:36:02,768
Whatever you say, l'm game.

366
00:36:02,852 --> 00:36:05,354
- What are you talking about?
- Yes, sirree.

367
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,981
Your birthday comes but once a year.

368
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:13,654
Maybe l'm being set up for something.

369
00:36:14,155 --> 00:36:15,906
You ever think about that, Marlon?

370
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:19,076
Like your whole life
has been building toward something?

371
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,160
No.

372
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,207
When you were hauling chickens
in the summer for Kaiser,

373
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:27,834
what was the furthest
you ever got off the island?

374
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:31,380
Went all over.
Never found a place like this, though.

375
00:36:32,882 --> 00:36:35,717
Look at that sunset, Truman.
Lt's perfect.

376
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:37,678
Yeah.

377
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,389
That's the big guy.

378
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:44,309
- Quite a paintbrush he's got.
- Yep.

379
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,857
Just between you and me, Marlon,

380
00:36:52,402 --> 00:36:54,528
l'm going away for a while.

381
00:36:55,738 --> 00:36:58,031
- Really?
- Yeah.

382
00:37:00,034 --> 00:37:01,493
Little angel.

383
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,543
My little clown.

384
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,338
Old carrot top.

385
00:37:14,048 --> 00:37:15,716
The best of both of us.

386
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:20,053
We should be
getting you home, Mother.

387
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:23,598
Hold on a minute.
Here's us at Mt. Rushmore.

388
00:37:23,683 --> 00:37:25,976
Do you remember, Truman,
when Dad was still with us?

389
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,521
That was quite a drive.
You slept the whole way there.

390
00:37:30,273 --> 00:37:31,898
Lt looks so small.

391
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,234
Things always do
when you look back, darling.

392
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:35,777
Look, Truman.

393
00:37:36,112 --> 00:37:38,655
The happiest day of our lives. Look.

394
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:43,493
Jean, Jodie, Joanne.

395
00:37:43,578 --> 00:37:46,079
Doesn't she look beautiful, Truman?

396
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,623
She still does.

397
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:51,418
And there's lots of pages left over
for baby photos.

398
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:55,088
L would like to hold a grandchild
in my arms before I go.

399
00:37:55,923 --> 00:37:57,841
Angela, we really should
be getting you home.

400
00:37:57,925 --> 00:38:00,427
- l'll take her.
- No. You stay, relax.

401
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:02,220
Enjoy yourself.
Your favorite show will be coming on.

402
00:38:02,305 --> 00:38:03,347
You sure?

403
00:38:03,431 --> 00:38:05,349
Besides, we have something
to discuss.

404
00:38:06,309 --> 00:38:09,936
- A certain person's birthday.
- L see.

405
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:15,025
And there'll be another episode of
l Love Lucy same time tomorrow.

406
00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:17,944
But right now,
it's time for Golden Oldies.

407
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:20,697
Tonight, we present
the enduring, much-loved classic,

408
00:38:20,782 --> 00:38:22,866
Show Me the Way to Go Home.

409
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:25,160
A hymn of praise to small-town life,

410
00:38:25,244 --> 00:38:27,537
where we learn
that you don't have to leave home

411
00:38:27,622 --> 00:38:32,250
to discover what the world's all about,
and that no one is poor who has friends.

412
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:37,255
Full of laughter and love, pain and
sadness, but ultimately redemption,

413
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,050
we share the trials and tribulations
of the Abbott family.

414
00:38:40,134 --> 00:38:43,053
Note the touching performance
of Ronald Brierly as Uncle Bunny.

415
00:38:43,137 --> 00:38:45,722
That scene with the bowl of cherries
is going to have you

416
00:38:45,807 --> 00:38:48,725
splitting your sides
with laughter all over again.

417
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:52,771
And there'll be tears, too,
when David and Jennifer are reunited.

418
00:38:52,855 --> 00:38:56,691
But enough from me.
Let's join the Abbotts in Camden village.

419
00:39:24,053 --> 00:39:25,804
Thank you, sweetie.

420
00:39:29,684 --> 00:39:33,019
L need to talk to you,
but let's go outside.

421
00:39:33,813 --> 00:39:37,858
- Sweetie, l'd love to, but l'm really late.
- What's your rush?

422
00:39:39,068 --> 00:39:40,277
Surgery.

423
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:43,822
There was that elevator disaster
downtown. lt was on the news last night.

424
00:39:43,906 --> 00:39:45,615
This cable just snapped.

425
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,243
This elevator,
it just plummeted down 10 flights.

426
00:39:48,327 --> 00:39:50,787
The non-union workers. Just monsters.

427
00:39:50,872 --> 00:39:53,498
That building, it's right next door
to where you work.

428
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:55,584
Can you imagine
if you had been in there?

429
00:39:55,668 --> 00:39:57,210
Lt's not even worth thinking about.

430
00:39:57,295 --> 00:40:00,213
Anyway, I have an amputation
on one of the young women

431
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:03,800
who was in that elevator.
She's very young. lt's very sad.

432
00:40:03,885 --> 00:40:07,345
- Anyway, wish me luck.
- L'll cross my fingers for you.

433
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:52,807
Excuse me. Hi. Excuse me.
May I help you?

434
00:40:54,477 --> 00:40:58,605
Yes. l'm looking for my wife,
Nurse Burbank. lt's very important.

435
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:02,067
L'm afraid that that's not possible.
She's in pre-op.

436
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,445
Sure. Okay, fine.

437
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,532
- Can you pass along a message?
- L'll try.

438
00:41:08,616 --> 00:41:12,369
Can you tell her I had to go to Fiji,
and that I'll call her when I get there?

439
00:41:12,453 --> 00:41:16,122
- When you get to Fiji?
- You got it.

440
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:19,668
- Fine. I'll tell her.
- Thank you so much.

441
00:41:46,445 --> 00:41:48,321
- Sorry.
- Lt's okay.

442
00:41:49,574 --> 00:41:51,908
Here, let me help you with that.

443
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:57,581
He's here.

444
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:01,001
L know.

445
00:42:02,003 --> 00:42:03,253
Scalpel.

446
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:13,597
L'm now making my primary incision

447
00:42:14,223 --> 00:42:17,267
just above the right knee.

448
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:21,271
Hold her.

449
00:42:22,356 --> 00:42:23,732
Nicely done.

450
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:27,110
This isn't going to be pretty.
Unless you're family...

451
00:42:27,194 --> 00:42:29,696
lt's just beautiful. Beautiful job.

452
00:42:31,616 --> 00:42:34,200
L'll just let someone else tidy up here.

453
00:42:58,726 --> 00:43:01,227
- l'm sorry to keep you.
- That's okay.

454
00:43:03,272 --> 00:43:07,067
- How can I help?
- L would like to book a flight to Fiji.

455
00:43:09,236 --> 00:43:11,446
When would you like to leave?

456
00:43:12,406 --> 00:43:13,573
Today.

457
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:34,969
L'm sorry. I don't have anything
for at least a month.

458
00:43:35,429 --> 00:43:37,931
- A month?
- Lt's the busy season.

459
00:43:40,226 --> 00:43:42,352
You want to book the flight?

460
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:46,898
Lt doesn't matter.
L'll make other arrangements, okay?

461
00:43:50,111 --> 00:43:53,029
Last call for Chicago!

462
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:55,782
All aboard!

463
00:44:00,913 --> 00:44:02,247
Thank you.

464
00:44:05,126 --> 00:44:07,127
Windy city, here we come.

465
00:44:09,255 --> 00:44:10,463
- Hi.
- Hi.

466
00:44:14,009 --> 00:44:15,802
Hello. Hi.

467
00:44:17,805 --> 00:44:18,847
Sisters.

468
00:44:18,931 --> 00:44:22,642
- Mom, isn't that...
- Face the front.

469
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:52,589
Everybody off. We've got a problem.

470
00:45:12,151 --> 00:45:13,693
L'm sorry, son.

471
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:30,251
His father was from Chicago,
wasn't he?

472
00:45:30,503 --> 00:45:34,214
No. His dentist was from Pensacola.
His father was from Des Moines.

473
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:36,382
But how come he wants to go
to Chicago?

474
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:39,093
He's not going to Chicago.
He's not going anywhere.

475
00:45:39,178 --> 00:45:41,262
He has to have it out with Meryl.

476
00:45:57,238 --> 00:45:58,404
Truman?

477
00:46:03,702 --> 00:46:06,913
- Honey, are you okay?
- Get in.

478
00:46:10,584 --> 00:46:11,793
Truman.

479
00:46:13,087 --> 00:46:14,212
Look.

480
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,967
What?

481
00:46:20,135 --> 00:46:22,762
L predict that in just a moment,

482
00:46:24,431 --> 00:46:28,601
we will see a lady on a red bike,
followed by a man with flowers

483
00:46:29,562 --> 00:46:32,605
and a Volkswagen Beetle
with a dented fender.

484
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,024
- Truman, please.
- Look.

485
00:46:40,823 --> 00:46:42,031
Lady,

486
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:44,868
flowers,

487
00:46:46,579 --> 00:46:48,162
and...

488
00:46:50,624 --> 00:46:53,543
- Truman, this is silly.
- There it is!

489
00:46:53,627 --> 00:46:55,962
There's that dented Beetle! Yes!

490
00:47:03,345 --> 00:47:05,972
Don't you want to know how I did that?
L'll tell you.

491
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:08,474
They're on a loop.
They go around the block.

492
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:12,395
They come back. They go around again.
They just go round and round.

493
00:47:12,479 --> 00:47:13,855
Round and round.

494
00:47:13,939 --> 00:47:16,274
L invited Rita and Marlon
for a barbecue on Sunday.

495
00:47:16,358 --> 00:47:18,818
- l'm gonna make my potato salad.
- L won't be here Sunday.

496
00:47:18,903 --> 00:47:20,862
L need you to remind me
we need more charcoal.

497
00:47:20,946 --> 00:47:23,823
Are you listening to a word l'm saying?

498
00:47:25,826 --> 00:47:29,329
You're upset because
you want to go to Fiji. ls that it?

499
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:33,207
Okay, go.

500
00:47:35,461 --> 00:47:39,172
L think you should save for
a few months, and then go.

501
00:47:39,965 --> 00:47:42,008
There. Are you happy now?

502
00:47:42,843 --> 00:47:44,177
L'm going to go take a shower.

503
00:47:46,722 --> 00:47:48,264
Let's go now.

504
00:47:48,682 --> 00:47:51,392
L'm ready to go now. Why wait?
Early bird gathers no moss.

505
00:47:51,477 --> 00:47:54,103
Rolling stone catches the worm, right?

506
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,274
Truman, what are you doing?

507
00:48:02,404 --> 00:48:03,613
Truman!

508
00:48:04,198 --> 00:48:07,533
Where shall we go?

509
00:48:08,911 --> 00:48:11,120
- Truman, where are we going?
- L don't really know.

510
00:48:11,205 --> 00:48:13,456
L guess l'm being spontaneous.

511
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:17,418
Somebody, help me!
L'm being spontaneous!

512
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,963
Forget Fiji.

513
00:48:20,047 --> 00:48:22,966
- Can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?
- No.

514
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:29,263
- What about Atlantic City?
- No, you hate to gamble.

515
00:48:29,348 --> 00:48:32,350
- That's right, I do, don't l?
- So why would you want to go there?

516
00:48:32,434 --> 00:48:36,646
Because I never have.
That's why people go places, isn't it?

517
00:48:37,398 --> 00:48:41,234
- Truman, I think l'm going to throw up.
- Me, too.

518
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,036
Blocked at every turn.

519
00:48:53,205 --> 00:48:55,039
Beautifully synchronized,
don't you agree?

520
00:48:55,124 --> 00:48:58,126
- You're blaming me for the traffic?
- Should l?

521
00:49:05,092 --> 00:49:08,511
Truman, let's go home.

522
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:12,640
You're right.
We could be stuck here for hours.

523
00:49:12,725 --> 00:49:15,059
Lt could be like this
all the way to Atlantic City.

524
00:49:15,144 --> 00:49:16,644
Let's go back.

525
00:49:17,896 --> 00:49:20,690
L'm sorry. I don't know what got into me.

526
00:49:24,403 --> 00:49:26,404
Can you please slow down?

527
00:49:27,322 --> 00:49:28,698
Yes, I can.

528
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:33,995
- Truman, that's our turnoff.
- L changed my mind again.

529
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,498
What's New Orleans like
this time of year? Mardi Gras!

530
00:49:43,964 --> 00:49:47,759
Look, Meryl, same road, no cars.

531
00:49:47,885 --> 00:49:49,260
Lt's magic.

532
00:49:49,762 --> 00:49:52,889
Look, you let me out.
You're not right in the head.

533
00:49:52,973 --> 00:49:55,266
You want to destroy yourself,
you do it on your own.

534
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:57,477
L think l'd like a little company.

535
00:50:03,984 --> 00:50:08,237
Truman, you knew this would happen.

536
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:12,366
You know you can't drive over water.

537
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:15,286
Let's go home where you'll feel safe.

538
00:50:17,915 --> 00:50:19,999
- Give me your hand.
- Sweetie.

539
00:50:20,876 --> 00:50:22,043
Drive.

540
00:50:22,628 --> 00:50:23,836
Truman!

541
00:50:24,338 --> 00:50:27,340
We shouldn't be doing this!
Truman, we're breaking the law!

542
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:29,133
- Oh, my!
- You can do it.

543
00:50:29,218 --> 00:50:31,260
- Please, don't!
- You can make it.

544
00:50:31,637 --> 00:50:32,887
Truman.

545
00:50:33,806 --> 00:50:34,931
We're over.

546
00:50:35,015 --> 00:50:38,351
- We're over the bridge.
- We're over?

547
00:50:38,936 --> 00:50:40,978
- We're over the bridge.
- We're over.

548
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,611
Truman, what about that sign?

549
00:50:48,695 --> 00:50:51,364
L'm sure they're exaggerating.
We'll be fine.

550
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:55,368
Exaggerating? Do you believe that?

551
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:57,411
- Truman, let's go back!
- Can't go back!

552
00:50:57,538 --> 00:51:00,123
Oh, my! Truman, we're on fire!

553
00:51:00,207 --> 00:51:01,624
- lt's okay.
- We're on fire!

554
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:03,626
Lt's okay. lt's just smoke.

555
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:05,253
- You okay?
- Yes.

556
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:07,463
- Want to do it again?
- No!

557
00:51:08,882 --> 00:51:11,717
Truman, stop! Oh, God!

558
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:17,723
So what are we going to do for money
when we get to New Orleans?

559
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:20,768
L have my Seahaven bank card.

560
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:25,189
So what? We're just gonna eat
into our savings, is that it?

561
00:51:25,732 --> 00:51:28,317
L'm going to have to call your mother
when we get there.

562
00:51:28,402 --> 00:51:32,905
She's going to be worried sick. I don't
know how she's going to take this.

563
00:51:44,251 --> 00:51:45,668
What now?

564
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:49,338
This is a red alert.

565
00:51:52,259 --> 00:51:54,635
Truman, it looks like a leak at the plant.

566
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,846
Back up. Leak at the plant.

567
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:59,348
- We had to shut her down.
- Ls there any way around?

568
00:51:59,433 --> 00:52:02,143
- Whole area's being evacuated.
- Ls there anything I can do?

569
00:52:02,227 --> 00:52:04,187
- No, ma'am.
- Thank you for your help.

570
00:52:04,271 --> 00:52:05,938
You're welcome, Truman.

571
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:08,733
Truman.

572
00:52:11,278 --> 00:52:13,112
Truman!

573
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,198
Truman, come back!

574
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:19,118
Stop him!

575
00:52:20,454 --> 00:52:21,787
Truman!

576
00:52:22,581 --> 00:52:23,956
Catch him on the left!

577
00:52:40,474 --> 00:52:41,849
Stay away!

578
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:49,273
No.

579
00:52:52,194 --> 00:52:53,819
Now in custody.

580
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:00,993
Thank you both so much for your help.
L really appreciate it.

581
00:53:01,328 --> 00:53:04,997
He's lucky to be alive, ma'am.
Next time, we'll have to file charges.

582
00:53:05,082 --> 00:53:06,540
L understand.

583
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:09,001
- Thanks again.
- Good night.

584
00:53:26,853 --> 00:53:29,438
Let me get you some help, Truman.

585
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:31,774
You're not well.

586
00:53:34,236 --> 00:53:36,946
Why do you want to have a baby
with me?

587
00:53:38,031 --> 00:53:39,782
You can't stand me.

588
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,826
That's not true.

589
00:53:46,498 --> 00:53:49,208
Why don't you let me fix you
some of this new Mococoa drink?

590
00:53:49,293 --> 00:53:52,545
All natural cocoa beans
from the upper slopes of Mt. Nicaragua.

591
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:54,380
No artificial sweeteners.

592
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:57,008
What the hell are you talking about?

593
00:53:57,551 --> 00:53:59,385
Who are you talking to?

594
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:02,555
L've tasted other cocoas.
This is the best.

595
00:54:02,681 --> 00:54:06,392
What the hell does this have to do
with anything?

596
00:54:07,185 --> 00:54:09,186
Tell me what's happening!

597
00:54:09,354 --> 00:54:12,815
You're having a nervous breakdown,
that's what's happening.

598
00:54:12,899 --> 00:54:15,109
You're part of this, aren't you?

599
00:54:17,321 --> 00:54:19,280
- Truman.
- Meryl!

600
00:54:19,906 --> 00:54:22,366
You are scaring me.

601
00:54:22,451 --> 00:54:25,077
No. You're scaring me, Meryl.

602
00:54:25,454 --> 00:54:29,290
What are you going to do? Dice me?
Slice me and peel me?

603
00:54:29,374 --> 00:54:31,792
There are so many choices!

604
00:54:32,586 --> 00:54:34,211
Do something!

605
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:36,589
What?

606
00:54:37,424 --> 00:54:39,258
What did you say?

607
00:54:39,593 --> 00:54:42,720
- Who were you talking to?
- Nothing. I didn't say anything.

608
00:54:42,804 --> 00:54:44,472
L didn't say anything.

609
00:54:44,556 --> 00:54:47,850
- You said "do something."
- No, I didn't. I wasn't talking to anybody.

610
00:54:47,934 --> 00:54:51,312
- Talk to me!
- L don't know anything. Please stop.

611
00:54:51,396 --> 00:54:52,980
Stay where you are.

612
00:54:54,149 --> 00:54:55,649
Truman?

613
00:54:57,069 --> 00:54:58,361
Truman.

614
00:54:58,987 --> 00:55:02,656
Oh, thank God!

615
00:55:05,786 --> 00:55:10,581
How can anyone expect me to carry on
under these conditions?

616
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:12,875
Lt's unprofessional.

617
00:55:13,794 --> 00:55:15,127
Lt's okay.

618
00:55:18,006 --> 00:55:22,259
Everything's going to be okay.
Lt's all gonna be fine.

619
00:55:25,806 --> 00:55:27,973
L don't know what to think, Marlon.

620
00:55:32,104 --> 00:55:34,313
Maybe l'm losing my mind, but...

621
00:55:38,652 --> 00:55:41,987
lt feels like the whole world
revolves around me somehow.

622
00:55:44,408 --> 00:55:47,076
That's a lot of world for one man,
Truman.

623
00:55:49,246 --> 00:55:51,330
Sure that's not wishful thinking?

624
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:54,792
You wishing you'd made something
more out of yourself?

625
00:55:55,669 --> 00:55:57,837
Come on, who hasn't sat in the john,

626
00:55:57,921 --> 00:56:00,631
had an imaginary interview
on Seahaven Tonight?

627
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:03,926
- Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
- This is different.

628
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:06,011
Everybody seems to be in on it.

629
00:56:10,392 --> 00:56:13,853
L've been your best friend
since we were 7 years old, Truman.

630
00:56:14,187 --> 00:56:16,147
The only way you and l
ever made it through school

631
00:56:16,231 --> 00:56:18,858
was by cheating off each other's
test papers.

632
00:56:19,901 --> 00:56:21,777
Jesus, they were identical.

633
00:56:24,072 --> 00:56:26,282
But I always felt safe knowing that.

634
00:56:27,284 --> 00:56:30,327
'Cause whatever the answer was,
we were right together,

635
00:56:30,579 --> 00:56:32,371
and we were wrong together.

636
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:37,084
Remember that time I stayed up
with you all night in your tent

637
00:56:37,169 --> 00:56:39,462
because you wanted to play North Pole?

638
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:41,630
And I got pneumonia?

639
00:56:43,675 --> 00:56:45,050
You remember that?

640
00:56:45,927 --> 00:56:48,387
You were out of school for
about a month.

641
00:56:54,769 --> 00:56:57,563
You're the closest thing I ever had
to a brother, Truman.

642
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:05,696
L know that things

643
00:57:06,865 --> 00:57:10,951
haven't really worked out for either of us
like we used to dream they would.

644
00:57:11,912 --> 00:57:15,748
L know that feeling, when it's like
everything's slipping away

645
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,126
and you don't want to believe it,

646
00:57:19,753 --> 00:57:22,463
so you look for answers
somewhere else, but...

647
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:30,471
The point is,

648
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:33,807
l'd gladly walk in front
of traffic for you.

649
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:43,651
The point is, I would gladly
step in front of traffic for you, Truman.

650
00:57:44,819 --> 00:57:48,072
And the last thing l'd ever do
is lie to you.

651
00:57:50,534 --> 00:57:53,077
And the last thing that I would ever do

652
00:57:55,956 --> 00:57:57,206
is lie to you.

653
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,461
L mean, think about it, Truman.

654
00:58:02,963 --> 00:58:04,755
Lf everybody is in on it,

655
00:58:07,509 --> 00:58:09,426
l'd have to be in on it, too.

656
00:58:18,478 --> 00:58:20,646
L'm not in on it, Truman, because

657
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:23,440
there is no "it."

658
00:58:27,571 --> 00:58:29,947
You were right about one thing, though.

659
00:58:30,657 --> 00:58:31,991
What's that?

660
00:58:33,702 --> 00:58:35,744
The thing that started all this.

661
00:58:51,177 --> 00:58:53,971
Yep. I found him for you, Truman.

662
00:58:54,347 --> 00:58:56,265
That's why I came by tonight.

663
00:58:57,142 --> 00:58:59,518
L'm sure he's got quite a story to tell.

664
00:59:03,356 --> 00:59:04,690
Go to him.

665
00:59:11,323 --> 00:59:12,865
Easy on the fog.

666
00:59:14,701 --> 00:59:16,577
Stand by, crane cam.

667
00:59:18,038 --> 00:59:19,413
Crane cam.

668
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:28,756
Button cam 3.

669
00:59:41,269 --> 00:59:43,354
L never stopped believing.

670
00:59:46,483 --> 00:59:49,443
And wide, curb cam 8.

671
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:51,278
My son.

672
00:59:53,073 --> 00:59:55,074
- Move in for a close-up?
- No.

673
00:59:57,077 --> 00:59:58,494
Move back

674
00:59:59,663 --> 01:00:01,121
and fade up music.

675
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,545
And now go in close.

676
01:00:09,798 --> 01:00:11,715
All those years wasted.

677
01:00:13,968 --> 01:00:17,262
L'll make it up to you, son. I swear.

678
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,603
Dad.

679
01:00:26,064 --> 01:00:27,106
Yes!

680
01:00:36,908 --> 01:00:38,075
Bravo.

681
01:00:38,493 --> 01:00:40,661
That will win the ratings period.

682
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:42,454
Congratulations.

683
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:44,623
Okay, everybody, quiet down.
Let's concentrate.

684
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:46,500
- Great television.
- That was good work.

685
01:00:47,252 --> 01:00:49,378
Let's get some champagne up here.

686
01:00:49,462 --> 01:00:50,921
Congratulations.

687
01:00:52,215 --> 01:00:55,926
- Well done, Christof.
- Lt was brilliant. lt just broke my heart.

688
01:00:59,639 --> 01:01:01,265
- Well done, everyone!
- Bravo!

689
01:01:01,349 --> 01:01:02,641
Congratulations.

690
01:01:20,744 --> 01:01:23,996
1.7 billion were there for his birth.

691
01:01:27,959 --> 01:01:31,420
220 countries tuned in for his first step.

692
01:01:31,504 --> 01:01:34,882
The world stood still for that stolen kiss.

693
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:37,509
And as he grew, so did the technology.

694
01:01:37,594 --> 01:01:39,678
An entire human life

695
01:01:39,804 --> 01:01:42,765
recorded on an intricate network
of hidden cameras

696
01:01:42,849 --> 01:01:46,685
and broadcast live and unedited,
24 hours a day,

697
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:49,855
seven days a week,
to an audience around the globe.

698
01:01:50,690 --> 01:01:53,525
Coming to you now
from Seahaven island,

699
01:01:53,735 --> 01:01:56,987
enclosed in the largest studio
ever constructed,

700
01:01:57,071 --> 01:01:59,323
and along with the Great Wall of China,

701
01:01:59,407 --> 01:02:02,701
one of only two manmade structures
visible from space,

702
01:02:03,411 --> 01:02:06,622
now in its 30th great year,

703
01:02:06,706 --> 01:02:08,624
it's The Truman Show.

704
01:02:13,379 --> 01:02:15,255
What a week it's been.
L don't know about you,

705
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:17,299
l was on pins and needles
the entire time.

706
01:02:17,801 --> 01:02:20,552
Hello and good evening.
L'm your host Mike Michaelson,

707
01:02:20,637 --> 01:02:22,012
and welcome to Trutalk.

708
01:02:22,096 --> 01:02:24,598
Our forum for issues growing
out of the show.

709
01:02:24,682 --> 01:02:27,267
But tonight,
something very special indeed.

710
01:02:27,393 --> 01:02:31,647
A rare and exclusive interview
with the show's conceiver and creator.

711
01:02:32,357 --> 01:02:35,692
So come with us now as we go live
to the lunar room

712
01:02:35,777 --> 01:02:39,154
on the 221 st floor
of the omni-cam ecosphere.

713
01:02:39,239 --> 01:02:42,866
That's where we'll find the world's
greatest tele-visionary.

714
01:02:43,076 --> 01:02:45,994
The designer and architect
of the world within a world

715
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:48,205
that is Seahaven lsland: Christof.

716
01:02:49,666 --> 01:02:52,501
Before we begin, l'd like to thank you
on behalf of our audience,

717
01:02:52,585 --> 01:02:54,419
for granting this exclusive interview.

718
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:56,755
We know how demanding
your schedule is

719
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,716
and we all know how jealously
you guard your privacy.

720
01:02:59,801 --> 01:03:02,094
This, sir, is indeed an honor.

721
01:03:02,262 --> 01:03:03,637
Don't mention it.

722
01:03:03,721 --> 01:03:06,640
The catalyst for the recent
dramatic events on the show

723
01:03:06,724 --> 01:03:08,809
has been Truman's father, Kirk,

724
01:03:08,893 --> 01:03:12,271
and his attempts to infiltrate the show.
But before we get into that,

725
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:15,023
l think it's worth noting
this is not the first time

726
01:03:15,108 --> 01:03:18,443
someone from the outside
has attempted to reach Truman, is it?

727
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:20,404
We have had our close calls in the past.

728
01:03:20,488 --> 01:03:23,574
Truman! lt's television! Yes!

729
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:27,494
Yes! I did it! l'm on The Truman Show!

730
01:03:28,288 --> 01:03:30,330
But there's never been anything
to compare with

731
01:03:30,415 --> 01:03:32,374
this most recent breach in security.

732
01:03:32,458 --> 01:03:35,627
The first intruder
to be a former cast member.

733
01:03:36,254 --> 01:03:37,379
A dead one at that.

734
01:03:37,463 --> 01:03:41,049
Got to say, writing Kirk back in,
masterstroke.

735
01:03:41,509 --> 01:03:44,011
Since Kirk started this whole crisis
in Truman's life,

736
01:03:44,095 --> 01:03:47,389
l came to the conclusion that he was
the only one who could end it.

737
01:03:47,473 --> 01:03:48,599
Truman!

738
01:03:48,683 --> 01:03:49,975
Truman, no!

739
01:03:50,977 --> 01:03:52,144
That's off-limits.

740
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:55,939
- Why? What's over there?
- Nothing. lt's dangerous. That's all.

741
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:58,400
You've got to know
your limitations, Truman.

742
01:03:58,484 --> 01:04:02,613
But let's remind viewers of exactly why
Dad was written out in the first place.

743
01:04:02,739 --> 01:04:06,074
As Truman grew up,
we were forced to manufacture ways

744
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:07,910
to keep him on the island.

745
01:04:08,202 --> 01:04:10,913
L'd like to be an explorer,
like the great Magellan.

746
01:04:10,997 --> 01:04:12,497
You're too late.

747
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:14,958
There's really nothing left to explore.

748
01:04:19,464 --> 01:04:22,090
Finally, I came up with the concept
of Kirk's drowning.

749
01:04:22,175 --> 01:04:25,302
Most effective. Truman's been
terrified of the water ever since.

750
01:04:25,386 --> 01:04:28,221
When Kirk read the synopsis
for the Death At Sea episode,

751
01:04:28,306 --> 01:04:31,767
he was disappointed, to say the least.

752
01:04:33,019 --> 01:04:35,437
L'm sure that's what caused him
to break back onto the set.

753
01:04:35,521 --> 01:04:38,857
But how do you intend to explain
his 22-year absence?

754
01:04:40,777 --> 01:04:43,070
- Amnesia.
- Brilliant.

755
01:04:43,863 --> 01:04:45,697
Let's take some viewer phone calls.

756
01:04:45,782 --> 01:04:48,700
Charlotte, North Carolina,
you're on with Christof.

757
01:04:49,786 --> 01:04:51,244
Yeah, hi, Christof.

758
01:04:51,537 --> 01:04:55,040
L was just wondering how many
cameras you got there in that town.

759
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,626
Somewhere in the vicinity of 5,000.

760
01:04:58,044 --> 01:05:02,756
- That's a lot of cameras.
- Remember, we started with just one.

761
01:05:04,509 --> 01:05:06,551
He was curious from birth.

762
01:05:07,553 --> 01:05:11,181
Premature by two weeks. lt was almost
as if he couldn't wait to get started.

763
01:05:11,265 --> 01:05:13,558
And his eagerness to leave
his mother's womb

764
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:16,144
was the very reason he was the one
who was selected.

765
01:05:16,229 --> 01:05:18,939
Ln competition
with five other unwanted pregnancies,

766
01:05:19,023 --> 01:05:21,817
the casting of a show,
determined by an air date,

767
01:05:21,943 --> 01:05:24,236
Truman was the one who
arrived on cue.

768
01:05:29,033 --> 01:05:31,910
Lncidentally, I believe
Truman is the first child

769
01:05:31,995 --> 01:05:34,496
to have been legally adopted
by a corporation.

770
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:35,706
That's correct.

771
01:05:35,790 --> 01:05:38,166
The show has generated
enormous revenues,

772
01:05:38,251 --> 01:05:41,503
now equivalent to the gross national
product of a small country.

773
01:05:41,587 --> 01:05:42,754
People forget it takes

774
01:05:42,839 --> 01:05:45,549
the population of an entire country
to keep the show running.

775
01:05:45,633 --> 01:05:49,302
Since the show is on 24 hours a day
without commercial interruption,

776
01:05:49,387 --> 01:05:52,931
all those staggering revenues
are generated by product placement.

777
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:55,684
That's true.
Everything on the show is for sale.

778
01:05:55,768 --> 01:05:59,062
From the actors' wardrobe, food
products, to the very homes they live in.

779
01:05:59,147 --> 01:06:01,481
All of it available in the Truman catalog

780
01:06:01,566 --> 01:06:02,941
and operators are standing by.

781
01:06:03,026 --> 01:06:04,776
Christof, let me ask you.

782
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:08,447
Why do you think
that Truman has never come close

783
01:06:08,948 --> 01:06:12,075
to discovering the true nature
of his world until now?

784
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:15,579
We accept the reality of the world
with which we are presented.

785
01:06:15,663 --> 01:06:17,289
Lt's as simple as that.

786
01:06:17,915 --> 01:06:19,541
The Hague for Christof.

787
01:06:19,625 --> 01:06:21,835
Hello? The Hague?

788
01:06:23,337 --> 01:06:26,923
All right, we've lost that call. Let's go
to Hollywood. You're on Trutalk.

789
01:06:27,008 --> 01:06:29,634
Hi, l'd just like to say one thing.

790
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:31,386
You're a liar and a manipulator.

791
01:06:31,471 --> 01:06:33,764
And what you've done to Truman
is sick.

792
01:06:35,308 --> 01:06:37,434
We remember this voice, don't we?

793
01:06:38,686 --> 01:06:41,188
- How could we forget?
- Let's go to another call.

794
01:06:41,272 --> 01:06:44,566
No. lt's fine, Mike.

795
01:06:44,984 --> 01:06:47,903
L love to reminisce
with former members of the cast.

796
01:06:49,155 --> 01:06:50,405
Sylvia,

797
01:06:51,365 --> 01:06:54,201
as you announced
so melodramatically to the world,

798
01:06:55,495 --> 01:06:58,747
you think because you batted your eyes
at Truman once,

799
01:07:00,124 --> 01:07:01,583
flirted with him,

800
01:07:01,918 --> 01:07:04,211
stole a few minutes of airtime with him

801
01:07:04,295 --> 01:07:07,464
to thrust yourself and your politics
into the limelight,

802
01:07:07,548 --> 01:07:11,259
that you know him?
That you know what's right for him?

803
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:14,387
You really think you're in a position
to judge him?

804
01:07:14,472 --> 01:07:16,598
What right do you have to take a baby

805
01:07:16,682 --> 01:07:19,351
and turn his life
into some kind of mockery?

806
01:07:20,186 --> 01:07:21,978
Don't you ever feel guilty?

807
01:07:23,648 --> 01:07:27,400
L have given Truman a chance
to lead a normal life.

808
01:07:28,736 --> 01:07:31,780
The world, the place you live in,

809
01:07:32,865 --> 01:07:34,282
is the sick place.

810
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:38,453
Seahaven is the way
the world should be.

811
01:07:38,538 --> 01:07:42,249
He's not a performer. He's a prisoner.
Look at what you've done to him!

812
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:44,042
He could leave at any time.

813
01:07:44,252 --> 01:07:46,795
Lf his was more than
just a vague ambition,

814
01:07:46,879 --> 01:07:50,465
if he was absolutely determined
to discover the truth,

815
01:07:51,676 --> 01:07:53,885
there's no way we could prevent him.

816
01:07:54,178 --> 01:07:56,847
L think what distresses you,

817
01:07:57,807 --> 01:08:01,059
really, caller, is that ultimately

818
01:08:02,311 --> 01:08:05,939
Truman prefers his cell, as you call it.

819
01:08:06,357 --> 01:08:08,066
That's where you're wrong.

820
01:08:08,568 --> 01:08:11,319
You're so wrong,
and he'll prove you wrong.

821
01:08:11,737 --> 01:08:15,949
Aside from the heated comments
of a very vocal minority,

822
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:18,869
it's been
an overwhelmingly positive experience.

823
01:08:19,078 --> 01:08:21,413
Yes. For Truman
and for the viewing public.

824
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:23,415
Christof, I can't thank you enough

825
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:25,959
for giving so generously
of your time tonight.

826
01:08:26,043 --> 01:08:28,920
L think it's safe to say that
now that this crisis is behind us

827
01:08:29,005 --> 01:08:30,672
and that Truman's back to his old self,

828
01:08:30,756 --> 01:08:34,092
we can look forward
to some exciting new developments.

829
01:08:34,177 --> 01:08:37,512
Mike, the big news is
that Meryl will be leaving Truman

830
01:08:37,597 --> 01:08:39,181
in an upcoming episode.

831
01:08:39,265 --> 01:08:41,933
And a new romantic interest
will be introduced.

832
01:08:42,602 --> 01:08:46,938
L'm determined that television's first
on-air conception will still take place.

833
01:08:47,356 --> 01:08:51,359
Another television milestone
straight ahead. You heard it here first.

834
01:08:51,444 --> 01:08:54,196
Lt has been a singular honor
and a pleasure, sir.

835
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:56,865
- Christof, thank you.
- Thank you, Mike.

836
01:10:15,319 --> 01:10:16,945
- Simeon.
- What?

837
01:10:21,367 --> 01:10:22,909
Ls he looking at us?

838
01:10:23,327 --> 01:10:25,287
Jesus, do you think he knows?

839
01:10:26,706 --> 01:10:27,706
Hello?

840
01:10:28,207 --> 01:10:29,749
Better call Christof.

841
01:10:29,875 --> 01:10:31,876
Hello? Come in, Major Burbank.

842
01:10:44,056 --> 01:10:45,056
Jesus.

843
01:10:49,395 --> 01:10:52,314
- He's back to his old self.
- Thank God.

844
01:11:00,156 --> 01:11:02,615
That's an unusual cat, my man.

845
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:10,749
L hereby proclaim this planet...

846
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:18,298
Trumania of the Burbank galaxy.

847
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:23,094
- ls he gonna go?
- Okay, hallway camera ready.

848
01:11:24,972 --> 01:11:26,348
That one's for free.

849
01:11:26,432 --> 01:11:28,391
Keep up with him,
'cause he'll move fast.

850
01:11:28,476 --> 01:11:30,602
Stand by, all house cameras.

851
01:11:31,645 --> 01:11:33,855
- Morning!
- Good morning.

852
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:35,690
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

853
01:11:35,775 --> 01:11:37,442
Ln case I don't see you...

854
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:40,070
Good afternoon, good evening,
and good night.

855
01:11:42,490 --> 01:11:44,866
- Good afternoon...
- Good morning.

856
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:47,077
Evening and good night.

857
01:11:47,745 --> 01:11:49,871
- Morning, Truman.
- Morning, Spencer.

858
01:11:49,955 --> 01:11:52,248
- How's it going?
- Let me check.

859
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:54,584
Vital signs are good.

860
01:11:56,962 --> 01:11:58,213
Pluto!

861
01:11:58,756 --> 01:12:00,382
Good morning, Truman.

862
01:12:00,466 --> 01:12:03,218
- Look who's here.
- Beautiful day, isn't it?

863
01:12:03,511 --> 01:12:04,636
Every single day.

864
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:07,639
The policy, we've thought about it
and we're gonna take it.

865
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:09,015
- You're kidding?
- No!

866
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:11,851
Why don't we go up to my office
right now and we'll sign the papers?

867
01:12:11,936 --> 01:12:14,562
Next week would be much better.

868
01:12:14,647 --> 01:12:17,857
- All right. See you guys.
- Okay, bye now. See you next week.

869
01:12:17,942 --> 01:12:20,610
- Give me something to look forward to.
- You got it.

870
01:12:20,694 --> 01:12:22,404
See, this isn't about insurance.

871
01:12:22,822 --> 01:12:26,991
This is about the great variable:
when will death occur?

872
01:12:27,326 --> 01:12:29,411
Could be a week, a month, a year.

873
01:12:30,454 --> 01:12:31,704
Could be today.

874
01:12:33,958 --> 01:12:36,251
"Sunbather, minding his own business,

875
01:12:37,086 --> 01:12:40,171
"stabbed in the heart by the tip
of a runaway beach umbrella."

876
01:12:40,256 --> 01:12:42,799
No way to guard against
that kind of thing.

877
01:12:44,969 --> 01:12:46,428
Sorry, excuse me.

878
01:12:46,637 --> 01:12:48,930
Truman, this is Vivien.
Vivien, this is Truman.

879
01:12:49,014 --> 01:12:51,349
The two of you are gonna be neighbors.

880
01:12:55,438 --> 01:12:59,149
L guess what l'm saying is that life is

881
01:12:59,942 --> 01:13:01,192
fragile.

882
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:04,571
- Vivien, your office.
- Sorry.

883
01:13:04,655 --> 01:13:07,699
What's that? l'm sorry.

884
01:13:08,742 --> 01:13:09,868
You do?

885
01:13:10,744 --> 01:13:13,705
Great. Let me take your information.

886
01:13:30,014 --> 01:13:31,639
Ready, 2. Go to 2.

887
01:13:36,103 --> 01:13:37,562
And back to medium.

888
01:13:39,607 --> 01:13:40,982
And wide.

889
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:51,743
L was just trying to train the kid to...

890
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:53,995
Never mind.

891
01:13:57,208 --> 01:13:59,250
What's he doing in the basement?

892
01:13:59,543 --> 01:14:02,045
He moved down there
after Meryl packed up and left.

893
01:14:02,129 --> 01:14:03,546
Why wasn't I told?

894
01:14:03,631 --> 01:14:06,257
Any unpredictable behavior
has to be reported.

895
01:14:07,676 --> 01:14:09,552
He's just sleeping, I thought.

896
01:14:09,637 --> 01:14:12,180
- This the best shot we've got?
- What's to see?

897
01:14:12,264 --> 01:14:15,892
- What's on the clock cam?
- Lt's an obstruction.

898
01:14:16,393 --> 01:14:20,146
- What happened down there?
- He was just tidying up his garbage.

899
01:14:21,148 --> 01:14:25,109
L was gonna call you, but halfway
through, he gave up, and he fell asleep.

900
01:14:25,486 --> 01:14:28,655
L wanna check on the setups
for the insurance convention tomorrow.

901
01:14:28,739 --> 01:14:30,114
- Yes.
- Yeah.

902
01:14:31,116 --> 01:14:32,450
Nice move.

903
01:14:41,544 --> 01:14:42,794
There you go.

904
01:14:53,764 --> 01:14:55,139
Lsolate the audio.

905
01:14:56,475 --> 01:14:58,476
Give me a close-up on his torso.

906
01:15:01,313 --> 01:15:02,814
He's still breathing.

907
01:15:05,025 --> 01:15:06,693
Where's Chloe? Call him.

908
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:10,154
- What do you want me to say?
- Tell him it's a wrong number.

909
01:15:13,617 --> 01:15:15,201
What took you so long?

910
01:15:15,661 --> 01:15:18,204
Just had to wait for it. They were busy.

911
01:15:19,123 --> 01:15:21,541
Here. What's going on?

912
01:15:22,376 --> 01:15:24,127
L don't know. They're...

913
01:15:24,295 --> 01:15:27,255
He came down into the room. He did
nothing but stand around for a while.

914
01:15:27,339 --> 01:15:28,840
Shut up and watch it.

915
01:15:29,466 --> 01:15:31,551
Then we went to night vision.

916
01:15:32,344 --> 01:15:33,761
He's asleep.

917
01:15:35,389 --> 01:15:36,639
- There!
- What?

918
01:15:37,057 --> 01:15:38,808
- Zoom in.
- On which?

919
01:15:39,143 --> 01:15:40,727
Under the chair there.

920
01:15:43,188 --> 01:15:44,522
Enhance it.

921
01:15:47,067 --> 01:15:49,569
- ls it...
- My God.

922
01:15:51,363 --> 01:15:54,490
He couldn't have gone up the stairs.
He must still be in the room.

923
01:15:54,575 --> 01:15:56,200
- Get Marlon over there.
- Right away.

924
01:16:11,884 --> 01:16:13,051
Truman!

925
01:16:13,927 --> 01:16:15,219
Surprise party!

926
01:16:17,264 --> 01:16:18,556
Come on, buddy.

927
01:16:18,807 --> 01:16:21,934
L got a six-pack of cold brewskis
with our name on them.

928
01:16:22,061 --> 01:16:24,354
Come on, pal. Come on, buddy.

929
01:16:28,359 --> 01:16:29,442
Shit.

930
01:16:32,738 --> 01:16:35,239
Marlon, find him. He's still in the room.

931
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:41,537
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

932
01:16:41,622 --> 01:16:43,414
That's good. Keep it light.

933
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:46,793
L know you're in here.
L'm gonna find you.

934
01:16:50,381 --> 01:16:51,964
Check under the table.

935
01:16:53,384 --> 01:16:55,009
The closet, behind you.

936
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:00,014
Huh.

937
01:17:01,809 --> 01:17:02,809
Gee.

938
01:17:03,686 --> 01:17:05,895
L wonder where he could possibly be.

939
01:17:13,821 --> 01:17:16,072
The lawn cam, get me the lawn cam.

940
01:17:23,747 --> 01:17:26,416
Don't look in the camera.
Say something. Keep it going.

941
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,625
He's gone.

942
01:17:28,127 --> 01:17:29,961
- Cut transmission!
- Cut transmission?

943
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:31,295
Cut it!

944
01:17:33,674 --> 01:17:35,550
Jesus! God in heaven!

945
01:17:37,136 --> 01:17:39,470
- Everything's black.
- Give me the phone.

946
01:17:52,317 --> 01:17:54,527
L don't know where he is, but he's gone.

947
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:03,995
All right. We've got
every available extra looking for him.

948
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:08,374
The principals are helping out. The
crew, too. So every sector's covered.

949
01:18:09,042 --> 01:18:11,753
- What about prop cars?
- Yes, they've been accounted for.

950
01:18:11,837 --> 01:18:13,254
He has to be on foot.

951
01:18:13,338 --> 01:18:16,257
He has the world's most
recognizable face. He can't disappear.

952
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:53,211
Go.

953
01:18:54,087 --> 01:18:57,715
Hunt him. Yeah. Go find him, Pluto.

954
01:18:58,300 --> 01:18:59,509
Good dog!

955
01:18:59,593 --> 01:19:00,843
All this fuss.

956
01:19:01,678 --> 01:19:03,679
Lf he could just hear my voice.

957
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,848
Truman!

958
01:19:08,977 --> 01:19:11,270
Let me try. Truman!

959
01:19:12,564 --> 01:19:14,398
Lt's me, Dad!

960
01:19:16,693 --> 01:19:17,902
Let's talk.

961
01:19:19,571 --> 01:19:21,072
Yeah, I know.

962
01:19:22,783 --> 01:19:24,700
Just about done with the square.

963
01:19:24,785 --> 01:19:27,370
Got to go back to Barrymore,
check the interiors.

964
01:19:27,454 --> 01:19:29,664
- He's got to be in there.
- Barrymore.

965
01:19:30,082 --> 01:19:32,208
But what about the college?
Who's watching that?

966
01:19:32,292 --> 01:19:33,292
L don't know.

967
01:19:33,377 --> 01:19:35,711
- Send somebody over there, okay?
- All right.

968
01:19:39,967 --> 01:19:42,343
Take another man
and get down there now, all right?

969
01:19:42,427 --> 01:19:44,679
L don't give a damn.
Just find the son of a bitch.

970
01:19:44,763 --> 01:19:45,721
Get some batteries.

971
01:19:45,806 --> 01:19:48,516
This guy's not gonna glow in the dark.
Get them down here.

972
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:51,310
L don't know what's going on.
Reroute it back to me.

973
01:19:51,395 --> 01:19:54,605
We need more light.
We'll never find him this way.

974
01:19:59,903 --> 01:20:01,279
What time is it?

975
01:20:01,613 --> 01:20:03,906
Lt's way too early for that.

976
01:20:10,622 --> 01:20:11,789
Cue the sun.

977
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:19,755
What time is it?

978
01:20:20,757 --> 01:20:22,466
Christof, what's going on?

979
01:20:23,010 --> 01:20:25,970
Did you know there's a rumor
circulating that he's dead?

980
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:27,221
You hear me?

981
01:20:27,306 --> 01:20:29,599
The media is having a feeding frenzy
over this.

982
01:20:29,683 --> 01:20:31,434
All the phone lines are jammed,

983
01:20:31,518 --> 01:20:33,102
and every network has a pirated shot

984
01:20:33,186 --> 01:20:35,467
of Marlon making an ass of himself
in front of the camera.

985
01:20:35,522 --> 01:20:37,732
The sponsors are threatening
to rip up their contracts.

986
01:20:37,816 --> 01:20:39,233
Why? We're getting higher ratings
with this graphic

987
01:20:39,318 --> 01:20:42,403
than we've ever had on this show.

988
01:20:45,324 --> 01:20:46,616
No sign of him.

989
01:20:46,783 --> 01:20:49,577
Marlon, why don't you head back to town
and join the others?

990
01:20:49,661 --> 01:20:52,622
Everyone else is at first positions, okay?
Thank you.

991
01:20:54,166 --> 01:20:56,375
Everyone's at first positions, right?

992
01:21:11,767 --> 01:21:15,269
We've got the light.
So he's got to be there somewhere.

993
01:21:18,065 --> 01:21:19,774
We're not watching the sea.

994
01:21:19,858 --> 01:21:22,401
Hang on a minute.
Why would we watch the sea?

995
01:21:23,028 --> 01:21:24,362
Sweep the harbor.

996
01:21:24,529 --> 01:21:26,072
Bring up the harbor cameras.

997
01:21:26,156 --> 01:21:28,491
Shift all harbor cameras to computer,
please.

998
01:21:28,575 --> 01:21:30,201
Some of those are out, aren't they?

999
01:21:30,285 --> 01:21:33,704
Yeah. We have four of them down,
but we have the lighthouse cameras up.

1000
01:21:33,789 --> 01:21:36,248
- All buoy cams, please.
- What's happening?

1001
01:21:37,376 --> 01:21:39,001
Long-lens, shore-based cameras.

1002
01:21:39,086 --> 01:21:41,128
- Why are we looking at the water?
- Good.

1003
01:21:41,213 --> 01:21:43,047
Pan and zoom please.

1004
01:21:46,510 --> 01:21:47,718
Truman,

1005
01:21:49,888 --> 01:21:51,389
where are you going?

1006
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:55,226
How can he sail? He's in insurance.

1007
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:57,812
- lsn't he terrified of the water?
- Resume transmission.

1008
01:21:57,896 --> 01:21:59,480
Resuming transmission.

1009
01:22:04,695 --> 01:22:07,822
- l got 2-to-1 he doesn't make it.
- L want a piece of that.

1010
01:22:07,906 --> 01:22:09,991
2-to-1 he doesn't make it.

1011
01:22:12,369 --> 01:22:14,078
Just leave them in the car.

1012
01:22:27,134 --> 01:22:31,012
Let's get off this mast shot. We can't
see his face. Go to the cabin cam.

1013
01:22:34,016 --> 01:22:35,558
There. Perfect.

1014
01:22:36,518 --> 01:22:38,060
That's our hero shot.

1015
01:23:03,670 --> 01:23:05,463
Let's get another boat out there.

1016
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:08,799
Okay. Listen, Gus, I need you to talk
to the guys on the ferry.

1017
01:23:08,884 --> 01:23:11,427
Come on. Get it moving.
Get it out of here.

1018
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:14,930
Come on.

1019
01:23:15,515 --> 01:23:19,143
- l'm usually the bus driver.
- Bottom line is they can't drive the boat.

1020
01:23:19,352 --> 01:23:20,644
They're actors.

1021
01:23:25,108 --> 01:23:26,567
How do we stop him?

1022
01:23:36,995 --> 01:23:38,204
Okay.

1023
01:23:40,707 --> 01:23:44,335
We're going to be accessing
the weather program now.

1024
01:23:45,003 --> 01:23:48,672
So hold onto your hats. You got that?

1025
01:23:49,174 --> 01:23:53,344
No. I think we're gonna want to localize
the storm over the boat.

1026
01:23:56,431 --> 01:23:58,432
You can get the coordinates for that.

1027
01:23:58,517 --> 01:24:01,143
There's no rescue boat.
He won't know what to do.

1028
01:24:01,228 --> 01:24:03,521
He'll turn back. He'll be too afraid.

1029
01:24:06,942 --> 01:24:08,317
Thar she blows.

1030
01:24:20,163 --> 01:24:21,330
Come on.

1031
01:24:45,063 --> 01:24:46,564
Give me some lightning.

1032
01:24:47,732 --> 01:24:48,816
Again.

1033
01:24:49,401 --> 01:24:50,609
Hit him again!

1034
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:04,582
For God's sake,
the whole world is watching.

1035
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:06,834
We can't let him die
in front of a live audience.

1036
01:25:06,918 --> 01:25:08,752
He was born in front of a live audience.

1037
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:39,200
Come on, Truman!

1038
01:25:42,787 --> 01:25:45,122
You can do it! Hold on!

1039
01:26:10,398 --> 01:26:12,483
Ls that the best you can do?

1040
01:26:14,027 --> 01:26:17,154
You're gonna have to kill me!

1041
01:26:18,323 --> 01:26:20,574
What shall we do with a drunken sailor?

1042
01:26:20,659 --> 01:26:23,244
- l demand that you cease transmission.
- Keep running.

1043
01:26:23,370 --> 01:26:27,665
What shall we do with a drunken sailor
Early in the mornin'?

1044
01:26:27,874 --> 01:26:30,417
Lncrease the wind.

1045
01:26:32,837 --> 01:26:35,297
- l'm telling you for the last time.
- How close is he?

1046
01:26:35,382 --> 01:26:36,799
- Very close.
- Capsize him. Tip him over.

1047
01:26:36,883 --> 01:26:39,760
- Damn you, Christof!
- You can't. He's tied himself to the boat!

1048
01:26:39,844 --> 01:26:40,844
Shut up!

1049
01:26:40,929 --> 01:26:42,721
He's gonna drown,
and he doesn't even care.

1050
01:26:42,806 --> 01:26:43,931
- Do it.
- No.

1051
01:26:44,015 --> 01:26:45,015
Do it!

1052
01:27:39,696 --> 01:27:40,946
That's enough.

1053
01:31:51,990 --> 01:31:53,532
L want to talk to him.

1054
01:32:12,510 --> 01:32:13,719
Truman.

1055
01:32:15,513 --> 01:32:16,805
You can speak.

1056
01:32:18,891 --> 01:32:20,183
L can hear you.

1057
01:32:24,731 --> 01:32:25,856
Who are you?

1058
01:32:25,982 --> 01:32:28,525
L am the creator of a television show

1059
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:31,612
that gives hope and joy and inspiration
to millions.

1060
01:32:36,534 --> 01:32:37,784
Then who am l?

1061
01:32:38,202 --> 01:32:39,578
You're the star.

1062
01:32:45,668 --> 01:32:47,044
Was nothing real?

1063
01:32:47,670 --> 01:32:48,920
You were real.

1064
01:32:50,381 --> 01:32:52,674
That's what made you so good to watch.

1065
01:32:53,384 --> 01:32:54,926
Listen to me, Truman.

1066
01:32:55,053 --> 01:32:57,220
There's no more truth out there

1067
01:32:58,306 --> 01:33:00,932
than there is in the world
l created for you.

1068
01:33:02,894 --> 01:33:04,436
The same lies,

1069
01:33:06,147 --> 01:33:07,481
the same deceit.

1070
01:33:08,441 --> 01:33:09,858
But in my world

1071
01:33:11,694 --> 01:33:13,403
you have nothing to fear.

1072
01:33:16,783 --> 01:33:19,326
L know you better than
you know yourself.

1073
01:33:19,410 --> 01:33:21,536
You never had a camera in my head.

1074
01:33:23,331 --> 01:33:24,581
You're afraid.

1075
01:33:25,875 --> 01:33:27,668
That's why you can't leave.

1076
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:33,757
Lt's okay, Truman.

1077
01:33:34,884 --> 01:33:36,134
L understand.

1078
01:33:37,929 --> 01:33:40,430
L have been watching you
your whole life.

1079
01:33:43,226 --> 01:33:45,352
L was watching when you were born.

1080
01:33:47,772 --> 01:33:50,315
L was watching
when you took your first step.

1081
01:33:54,612 --> 01:33:57,114
L watched you on your first day
of school.

1082
01:33:59,992 --> 01:34:02,536
The episode when you lost
your first tooth.

1083
01:34:06,999 --> 01:34:08,709
You can't leave, Truman.

1084
01:34:10,336 --> 01:34:11,753
Please, God.

1085
01:34:11,838 --> 01:34:13,296
You belong here...

1086
01:34:13,506 --> 01:34:14,715
You can do it.

1087
01:34:16,634 --> 01:34:17,843
With me.

1088
01:34:20,346 --> 01:34:21,638
Talk to me.

1089
01:34:23,015 --> 01:34:24,266
Say something.

1090
01:34:28,688 --> 01:34:31,815
Say something, God damn it.
You're on television.

1091
01:34:32,191 --> 01:34:34,192
You're live to the whole world.

1092
01:34:51,836 --> 01:34:53,670
Ln case I don't see you,

1093
01:34:54,839 --> 01:34:57,382
good afternoon, good evening,
and good night.

1094
01:35:00,595 --> 01:35:01,636
Yeah.

1095
01:35:24,744 --> 01:35:26,161
Yeah!

1096
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:38,924
- He made it! Yeah!
- All right, Truman!

1097
01:35:48,768 --> 01:35:51,269
- Cease transmission.
- Ceasing transmission.

1098
01:35:55,983 --> 01:35:58,276
- You want another slice?
- No. l'm okay.
