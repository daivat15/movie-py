1
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,119
You Red Welby?

2
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,550
Yes, ma'am.
How may I help you?

3
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,597
I hear those three billboards
out on Drinkwater Road,

4
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,319
you're in charge of renting 'em out,
that right?

5
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,710
I didn't know we had any billboards
out on Drinkwater Roa...

6
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,440
- where is Drinkwater Road?
- It's the road out past Sizemore turn-off.

7
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,239
Nobody uses it
since the freeway got put in.

8
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,636
You're right.

9
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,949
We got three billboards
out there.

10
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,033
Nobody's put nothing up
out there since 1986.

11
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,236
That was Huggies.

12
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,152
How much to rent all three
of them out for the year?

13
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,350
A year?

14
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,391
You wanna pay for three billboards
on a road that no one goes down

15
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,073
unless they got lost
or they're retards...

16
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,953
- for a year?
- Quick, ain't you, Welby?

17
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,831
Well...

18
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,152
since what I say goes these days

19
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,197
down at the Ebbing Advertising Desk,

20
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,476
I'm gonna strike you
a real good deal on those billboards.

21
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,358
Now, what was it your name was, Missus...

22
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,274
What's the law on what you can
and cannot say on a billboard?

23
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,150
I assume you can't say nothing defamatory,

24
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,675
and you can't say "fuck,"
"piss," or "cunt." That right?

25
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,750
Uh...

26
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,470
Or...

27
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,196
"anus."

28
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,840
Well, I think I'll be all right then.

29
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,992
Here's 5,000 for the first month.

30
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,957
I assume that'll cover it.

31
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,998
And here's what the billboards are to say.

32
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,631
Why don't you write up a contract
betwixt us while you're at it,

33
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,996
make sure nobody rents them
billboards out from under me.

34
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,997
I guess you're
Angela Hayes's mother.

35
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,993
That's right.
I'm Angela Hayes's mother.

36
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,790
Name's Mildred.

37
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,400
How long before you get 'em put up?

38
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,715
Shall we say by...

39
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,280
Easter Sunday?

40
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,996
That'd be perfect.

41
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,799
<i>- Hey, what the hell is this?
- Que?</i>

42
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,719
"How come,
Chief Willoughby" what?

43
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,234
- What?
- Yeah.

44
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,277
- Huh?
- "How come" what?

45
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,158
- What, what?
- What?

46
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,232
Listen, you fucking beaner,
I'd better start getting

47
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,470
some straight answers outta you.

48
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,471
Put that down.

49
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,589
What the hell is this?

50
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,596
Hey, you.
What the fuck is this?

51
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,830
What the fuck is what?

52
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,798
This! This.

53
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,194
- Advertising, I guess.
- Advertising what?

54
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,835
Something obscure?

55
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,559
I'll say. Yeah.

56
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,399
Don't I know your face
from some place?

57
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,077
- I don't know, do you?
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

58
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,638
I could arrest you right now
if I wanted to.

59
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,712
- For what?
- For emptying your bucket there.

60
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,393
That's... that's against the...

61
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,472
being bad against the environment laws.

62
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,634
Well, before you do that,
Officer Dixon...

63
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,194
how about you go have yourself a look
at that first billboard over there?

64
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,593
And then we can have ourself
a conversation

65
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,273
about the motherfucking environment.

66
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,236
How about that?

67
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,630
Fuck me.

68
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,474
Don't, William.

69
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,872
Dixon, you goddamn asshole.

70
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,350
I'm in the middle
of my goddamn Easter dinner.

71
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,471
Sorry, kids.

72
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,791
I know, Chief,

73
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,837
and I'm sorry for calling you
at home and all, but...

74
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,515
I think we got kind of a problem.

75
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,311
Hey.

76
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,032
Sorry I'm late, Denise.

77
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,511
Did you put up those billboards
to fuck with the cops yet?

78
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,590
They're up.

79
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,400
You go, girl.
You go fuck those cops up.

80
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,918
What the fuck
do you think you're doing, Welby,

81
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,315
a bunch of billboards like that?

82
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,517
You didn't think there'd be
some kind of ramifications, legally?

83
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,193
What's the legal ramifications, Cedric?

84
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,112
You want me to explain
legal ramifications,

85
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,715
little punk like you?
And don't call me Cedric!

86
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,672
Ain't contravening no laws on propriety.

87
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,519
Ain't contravening no laws
on any fucking thing.

88
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,670
I checked all this out.

89
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,080
And where'd you check all this out?

90
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,071
In a...

91
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,156
- a book.
- Which book, genius?

92
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,471
<i>Book called Suck My Ass,
It's None Of Your Business.</i>

93
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,959
Fuck.

94
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,600
How long has this person, or persons,

95
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,639
rented these
billboards out for?

96
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,157
Oh... the year.

97
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,279
How long has she actually paid for?

98
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,231
The year.

99
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,833
So it's a "she," is it?

100
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,198
I ain't at liberty to divulge
that kind of information, Chief.

101
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,554
Mildred Hayes, perhaps?

102
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,440
Ain't at liberty to divulge
that kind of information, Chief.

103
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,510
Do you really wanna fuck

104
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,472
with the Ebbing Police Department, Red?

105
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,237
Do you?

106
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,356
I guess.

107
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,117
He said what? To your face?

108
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,600
No crime has been committed here.

109
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,672
Oh, come on.
Defamation of character ain't a crime?

110
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,480
It isn't defamation
if she's simply asking a question.

111
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,391
What are you, an idiot?

112
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,994
Don't call me an idiot, Dixon!

113
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,309
I didn't call you an idiot.

114
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,993
I asked if you was an idiot.
That was a question.

115
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,430
- He got you there, Cedric.
- That's it? Come on, man!

116
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,512
Hey! Don't go flying off the handle.

117
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,319
Why in the hell you keep that man on?

118
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,516
He's a good man at heart.

119
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,557
He tortured a guy in custody, Bill.

120
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,838
There was no...
real evidence to support that.

121
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,116
Take 'em down.

122
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,479
- Huh?
- Take that shit down.

123
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,710
Take what shit down?

124
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,675
Hey, boy. You think I wouldn't take
you out right here on Main Street, Red?

125
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,717
I thought you only took out
black dudes, Dixon.

126
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,793
No! No! Stop it.

127
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,917
You ever fucking touch me,
motherfucker...

128
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,196
You drunk?

129
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,553
- Are you drunk right now?
- Get up.

130
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,870
Nobody ever goes down that road anyways.

131
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,794
Unless they got lost. Or they're retards.

132
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,599
Well, don't be nervous,
is the main thing.

133
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,636
It'll go just fine.

134
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,760
Don't look in the camera, obviously.

135
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,160
Let's hold for this car.

136
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,956
In three, two, one.

137
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,356
So, Mildred Hayes,
why did you put up these billboards?

138
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,069
<i>My daughter, Angela,</i>

139
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,995
<i>was abducted, raped and murdered
seven months ago</i>

140
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,958
<i>along this selfsame stretch of road.</i>

141
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,236
What you watching, Momma?
Stupid news?

142
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,073
<i>It seems to me the local police department</i>

143
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,277
<i>is too busy going around
torturing black folks</i>

144
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,434
<i>to be bothered doing anything
about solving actual crime.</i>

145
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,918
<i>I thought these billboards
might concentrate their minds some.</i>

146
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,311
Fuck.

147
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,875
<i>I don't know what the
police are doing, to be honest with you.</i>

148
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,636
I do know that my daughter's burnt body
is lying six feet underground.

149
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,919
All they're doing is eating Krispy Kremes

150
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,680
<i>and busting eight-year-olds
for skating around parking lots.</i>

151
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,520
<i>And Chief Willoughby,</i>

152
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,676
<i>why single him out?</i>

153
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,360
<i>He's the head of them, ain't he?</i>

154
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,840
<i>The buck's gotta stop somewhere.</i>

155
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,354
<i>And the buck stops at Willoughby?</i>

156
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,954
<i>Yeah, the buck stops at Willoughby.</i>

157
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,394
<i>Dead right it does.</i>

158
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,556
You all right there, fella?

159
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,715
Looks like we got a war on our hands.

160
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,631
Can we talk?

161
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,759
I'd do anything to catch the guy
who did it, Mrs. Hayes.

162
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,231
But when the DNA don't match
no one who's ever been arrested,

163
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,075
and when the DNA don't match
any other crime nationwide,

164
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,715
and when there wasn't a single eyewitness

165
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,713
from the time she'd left your house
to the time we found her, well...

166
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,152
right now there ain't
too much more we can do.

167
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,675
Could pull blood
from every man and boy in this town

168
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,638
over the age of eight.

169
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,954
There's civil rights laws
prevents that, Mrs. Hayes.

170
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,273
And what if he was
just passing through town?

171
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,079
Pull blood from every man
in the country, then.

172
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,197
Then what if he was just passing
through the country?

173
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,319
If it was me,
I'd start up a database.

174
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,710
Every male baby what's born,
stick them on it,

175
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,913
and as soon as he done something wrong,

176
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,470
cross-reference it,

177
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,394
make 100% certain it was
a correct match,

178
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,357
then kill him.

179
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,194
Yeah, well, there's...

180
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,156
definitely civil rights laws
prevents that.

181
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,117
Ah.

182
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,392
I'm doing everything I can
to track him down.

183
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,198
I don't think those billboards
is very fair.

184
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,352
The time it took you to get out here
whining like a bitch, Willoughby,

185
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,875
some other poor girl's probably
out there being butchered right now.

186
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,350
But I'm glad you got your priorities
straight, I'll say that for you.

187
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,032
There's something else, Mildred.

188
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,196
I got cancer.

189
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,912
- I'm dying.
- I know it.

190
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,957
Huh?

191
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,477
I know it.
Most everybody in town knows it.

192
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,391
And you still put up those billboards?

193
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,917
Well, they wouldn't be
as effective after you croak. Right?

194
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,600
Well, looky looky.

195
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,597
If it ain't the instigator of this whole
goddamn affair in the first place.

196
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,239
I didn't instigate shit, Dixon.

197
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,837
Playing pool against the town midget.

198
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,190
He's right, Red,

199
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,397
you are playing pool
against the town midget.

200
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,278
You know, he's a cop.
You know, he's observant.

201
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,433
I always disliked you, Red,

202
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,757
ever since you was a snotty little child.

203
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,595
You still look like a snotty little child.

204
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,156
That's unfortunate.
I always thought you was great.

205
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,200
Even your name, Red Welby.

206
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,516
- Even your name I disliked.
- Well...

207
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,517
okay.

208
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,310
Like you was some kind
of goddamn communist or something...

209
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,710
- and proud of it.
- No, it's 'cause I got red hair.

210
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,031
You know what they do to faggots
down in Cuba, Welby?

211
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,360
Wow, that's left field.

212
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,160
No, what do they do to faggots
down in Cuba, Dixon?

213
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,631
They kill 'em.

214
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,840
Which, it might surprise you
to learn, I'm against.

215
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,589
I'm not sure if they do kill faggots
down in Cuba, Dixon.

216
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,911
I know Cuba's human rights
record's pretty deplorable

217
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,957
when it comes to homosexuality,

218
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,430
but killing 'em?

219
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,833
Are you sure
you ain't thinking of Wyoming?

220
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,876
Always with the smart-ass. Jesus.

221
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,870
He's quite good, isn't he?

222
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,672
Hey, Willoughby's a good man.
Hey, look at me. Hey, look at me.

223
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,719
I'm talking nice to you now, aren't I?

224
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,154
I'm talking nice to you.

225
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,759
Willoughby's a good man, Red.

226
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,071
Shouldn't have this be
the only thing he thinks about,

227
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,000
last months left to him.

228
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,150
Last months what?

229
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,117
Oh, you...

230
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,836
you didn't know?

231
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,992
Yeah, pancre... pancreatic.

232
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,152
I'm up next.
You old ladies quit yakking.

233
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,073
- Rude.
- Hey, Mildred.

234
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,117
I saw you on TV the other day.

235
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,839
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, you looked good.

236
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,038
I mean, you know,
you came across really good

237
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,873
in the things
that you were saying.

238
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,077
I didn't think
you came across real good.

239
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,437
I think you sounded...
you came across as a stupid-ass.

240
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,557
Ain't it about time you got home
to your momma, Dixon?

241
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,712
No, it ain't time I go home
to my mama... momma.

242
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,077
I told her I was gonna be out
till 12:00, actually.

243
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,751
Jesus.

244
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,990
That's me versus you, Mildred.

245
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,835
Hey, Robbie. I think
that midget wants to get in my pants.

246
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,593
Father Montgomery.

247
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:52,592
Mildred. I'm... I'm sorry to be calling
on you so late, but, uh...

248
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,678
I must say, Robbie has been
the consummate host.

249
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,831
Despite his having had,
as he was just telling me,

250
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,957
somewhat of a tricky day at school.

251
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,039
Oh, no. Just some of the guys
on the team was giving me crap.

252
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,156
Crap about what?

253
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,436
About the billboards, Mildred.

254
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,112
Which is what I've come
to have a word with you about.

255
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,192
Oh. Proceed.

256
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,434
I know how hard
it's been for you, Mildred,

257
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,160
this past year. We all do.

258
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,553
And if there is
ever anything that you need,

259
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,270
we will be there for you. Always.

260
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,993
But the town also knows

261
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,874
what kind of a man
William Willoughby is.

262
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,073
And the town is dead set
against these billboards of yours.

263
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,710
Took a poll, did you, Father?

264
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,833
You know, Mildred,
if you hadn't stopped coming to church,

265
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,074
you'd have a little bit more understanding

266
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,958
of the depth of people's feelings.

267
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,353
I had more than a dozen people
come up to me on Sunday.

268
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,157
So, yes, I took a poll.

269
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,871
Everybody is with you about Angela.

270
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,917
Nobody is with you about this.

271
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,552
You know what I was thinking about today?

272
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,120
I was thinking about those street gangs

273
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,680
they have down in Los Angeles,

274
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,592
those Crips and those Bloods.

275
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,359
And I was thinking
about that bunch of new laws

276
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,558
they came up with
in the 1980s, I think it was,

277
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,077
to combat those street gangs,
those Crips and those Bloods.

278
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,676
And, if I remember rightly, the gist
of what those new laws were saying was,

279
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,154
if you join one of these gangs,
and you're running with them,

280
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,036
and down the block one night,
unbeknownst to you,

281
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,430
one of your fellow Crips,
or your fellow Bloods,

282
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,080
shoot up a place, or stab a guy...

283
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,150
well then, even though
you may not know nothing about it

284
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,318
and even though you may have
just been standing on a street corner,

285
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,834
minding your own business...

286
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,595
What these new laws said was
you're still culpable.

287
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,790
You're still culpable
by the very act of having joined

288
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,837
those Crips and those Bloods
in the first place.

289
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,633
Which got me thinking, Father...

290
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,999
that whole type of situation

291
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,151
is kinda like you church boys, ain't it?

292
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,632
You got your colors,
you got your clubhouse.

293
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,758
You're, for want
of a better word, a gang.

294
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,234
And if you were upstairs
smoking a pipe and reading your Bible...

295
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,638
while one
of your fellow gang members

296
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,712
is downstairs fucking
an altar boy, well...

297
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,873
Father, just like those Crips,
and just like those Bloods,

298
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,837
you're culpable...

299
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,631
'cause you joined the gang, man.

300
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,279
I don't care if you never did shit,

301
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,397
you never saw shit,
you never heard shit.

302
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,754
You join the gang,
you're culpable.

303
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,073
And when a person is culpable
to altar-boy-fucking,

304
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,435
or any kinda boy-fucking,

305
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,876
'cause I know you guys didn't
really narrow that down...

306
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,837
then you kinda forfeit the right
to come into my house

307
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,719
and say anything about me or my life,

308
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,917
or my daughter, or my billboards.

309
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,916
So why don't you just finish up
your tea there, Father,

310
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,639
and get the fuck
outta my kitchen.

311
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,593
But thanks for coming up anyway, Father.

312
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,354
How you been feeling, Bill?

313
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,357
Ah, like I got cancer in a major organ.

314
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,038
Well, I just want you to know
we're all on your side

315
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,679
about this
Mildred Hayes thing.

316
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,438
If I have to hear that
one more fucking time...

317
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,118
I'm done with this shit.
I can't waste my life waiting.

318
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,318
Stop reading
fucking comic books

319
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,357
and get me the file
on the Hayes case.

320
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,390
Angela Hayes case
or the Mildred Hayes case?

321
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,597
There is no Mildred Hayes case.

322
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,239
We've had two official complaints

323
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,959
about those billboards, so, actually...

324
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,036
From who?

325
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,759
There's a lady with a funny eye...

326
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,349
and a fat dentist.

327
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,272
Get me the file
on the Angela Hayes case.

328
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,640
"A lady with a funny fucking eye"?

329
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,749
Jesus Christ.

330
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,076
Late night?

331
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,271
No.

332
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,713
Lay off that Welby guy, will you?

333
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,276
Or you'll do what?

334
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,152
Kick your momma's
fucking teeth in.

335
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,879
No, you won't.

336
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,631
Who told you I was laying
on him anyway? The midget?

337
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,833
What the fuck are you talking about?

338
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,757
And I'm trying to fucking concentrate.

339
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,830
Fucking midgets!

340
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,195
What you looking for anyway?

341
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,189
There's nothing to look for.

342
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,829
I don't know what it is.

343
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,079
It feels like
it's kinda waggling.

344
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,439
Well, if it's waggling,
it's gonna have to come out.

345
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,313
Ain't you gonna
take a look at it first?

346
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,840
It's gonna have to come out.

347
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,675
Can I get a little Novocaine there, Doc?

348
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,034
Give it a couple of minutes.

349
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,871
I just wanted to say
there's a lot of good friends

350
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,519
of Bill Willoughby in this town,
Miss Hayes.

351
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,592
No! Ow! Stop! No!

352
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,555
God damn it!

353
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,435
Then why don't you tell
those good friends of Bill Willoughby

354
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,160
to tell him to go
do his fucking job, fat boy.

355
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,116
Hey there, Mildred.

356
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,474
You didn't happen to pay a visit

357
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,630
to the dentist today, did you?

358
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,473
- No.
- Huh?

359
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,597
I said, "No."

360
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,591
Oh, so it wasn't you
who drilled a little hole

361
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,469
in one of big fat Geoffrey's
big fat thumbnails, no?

362
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,673
- Of course not.
- Huh?

363
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,638
I said, "Of course not."

364
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,633
You drilled a hole in the dentist?

365
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,240
Denise, no, I didn't.

366
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,596
I thought
it was kinda funny myself, but...

367
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,994
he wants to press charges,

368
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,515
so we're gonna have
to bring you in, I'm afraid.

369
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,873
So how's it all going
in the nigger-torturing business, Dixon?

370
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,472
It's persons-of-color-torturing business,
these days.

371
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,036
If you wanna know...

372
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,236
I didn't torture nobody.

373
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,510
What's the matter with you,
saying that goddamn stuff on TV?

374
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,640
My momma watches that station.

375
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,514
Your momma doesn't know
about the torturing?

376
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,115
No, she doesn't know anything about it.
She's against that kinda thing.

377
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,270
Who's against what?

378
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,194
My mama... momma is against
persons-of-color-torturing.

379
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,680
She said, "Nigger-torturing."

380
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,831
I said, "You can't say
'nigger-torturing' no more.

381
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,673
"You gotta say
persons-of-color-torturing."

382
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,431
Isn't that right, Chief?

383
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,071
Ain't that right?

384
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,876
I think I'll be able
to take care of Mrs. Hayes

385
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,713
on my own from here on, Jason.

386
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,478
Sure, Chief. I'll be right outside.

387
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,994
Don't give me that look.

388
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,352
If you got rid of every cop
with vaguely racist leanings,

389
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,830
you'd have... three cops left,

390
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,151
and all of them
are gonna hate the fags.

391
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,833
So what are you gonna do,
you know?

392
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,240
I wanna know something, Mildred.

393
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,360
Why'd you drill a hole

394
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,353
through poor fat Geoffrey's thumbnail?

395
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,760
That did not happen.

396
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,597
His hand slipped.

397
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,753
He drilled a hole
through his own self.

398
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,795
Did he say I did it?

399
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,073
I guess
it's his word against mine, then, huh?

400
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,197
Kinda like in all those rape cases
you hear about.

401
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,912
Except, this time,
the chick ain't losing.

402
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,152
It ain't really about winning
or losing, though, is it, Mildred?

403
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:48,273
You think I care about who wins or loses
between the two of youse?

404
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,513
You think
I care about dentists?

405
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,719
I don't care about dentists.

406
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,197
Nobody cares about dentists.

407
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,954
What I do care about, or what I'm...

408
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,395
interested in...

409
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,354
is tying you up in court so long

410
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,754
that your hours at the gift shop
be so shot to shit

411
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,839
that you ain't gonna have a penny

412
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,196
to pay for another month's billboards.

413
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,920
- I got some dough put...
- That's what I'm interested in.

414
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,275
I got some dough put away.

415
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,430
But what I heard was you had to sell off
your ex-husband's tractor-trailer

416
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,035
to even pay for this month's
billboards, that right?

417
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,918
How is old Charlie, by the way?

418
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,794
He still shacked up with that pretty
little intern works down at the zoo?

419
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,395
He's still shacked up
with some chick smells of shit.

420
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,958
I don't know if the zoo's
got anything to do with it.

421
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,874
Although I'd hope so.

422
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,029
How old is she? Nineteen?

423
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,634
That must smart.

424
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,475
Keep trying. Keep trying.

425
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,719
What's Charlie think about
these here billboards of yours,

426
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,519
an ex-cop like Charlie?

427
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,240
Ex-cop, ex-wife-beater.
Same difference, I guess, right?

428
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,880
His word against yours,
though, right?

429
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,520
Charlie don't know about 'em, does he?

430
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,830
It's none of his business.

431
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,718
Well, he's kinda paying for 'em,
though, ain't he?

432
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,190
- I'm paying for 'em!
- This month you are.

433
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,873
How about when...

434
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,478
- I... I didn't mean to...
- I know.

435
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,992
- It was an accident.
- I know, baby.

436
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,036
It's blood.

437
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,275
I'm gonna go get somebody.

438
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,394
Hey!

439
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,070
- Just let her go.
- Come on, Chief.

440
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,874
Just let her go!

441
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,629
Easy, easy, easy.

442
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,270
Hey.

443
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,515
- Do birds get cancer?
- Huh?

444
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:20,032
- Birds. Do they get cancer?
- I don't know. Dogs do.

445
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,079
Yeah, well, I wasn't talking
about dogs, was I?

446
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,996
Great, the good old
"Raped While Dying" route home.

447
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,753
'Cause if there was two seconds in a day

448
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,072
when I wasn't thinking about her
and I wasn't thinking about how she died,

449
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,550
"There you go! Think about it
some more, why don't you?"

450
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,600
It's good too, that as much
as a person might have tried

451
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,911
to avoid the details of what happened

452
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,798
'cause he didn't think
it would do any good,

453
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,712
and he didn't think he could bear it...

454
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,715
it's also good to be informed

455
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,837
in 20-foot-high font
and in real nice lettering

456
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,958
the precise details of her last moments.

457
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,837
That it wasn't enough that she was raped

458
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,989
and it wasn't enough that she died, no.

459
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,113
"Raped While Dying."

460
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,396
Thank you, Mom.

461
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,437
I gave you the police reports.

462
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,749
I didn't read 'em.

463
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,475
I'm depressed enough as it fucking is.

464
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,470
<i>Mom?</i>

465
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,837
<i>Yeah?</i>

466
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,197
<i>You ain't going out
again tonight, are ya?</i>

467
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,431
Denise and I are gonna
grab a couple of beers, yeah.

468
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,835
Denise gonna be driving you?

469
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,435
Angela, Why don't you just ask me
if you can borrow the car?

470
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,477
- Can I borrow the car?
- No.

471
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,678
- Bitch!
- I will give you money for a taxi

472
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,353
if you ask me nice
and don't call me a bitch.

473
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,591
Why'd you make me ask you
if you was never gonna let me borrow it?

474
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,320
'Cause it was funny! And because
you've been smoking pot all day.

475
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,357
- You are such a hypocrite.
- Hypocrite?

476
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,874
- Yeah.
- How?

477
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,792
You drove drunk with us
in the car when we were kids.

478
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,635
- What are you talking about?
- Daddy told me.

479
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,676
- When'd you see him?
- Don't change the subject.

480
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,072
Did you or did you not drive drunk with us
in the car when we were kids?

481
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,356
- Once, maybe.
- Okay, once?

482
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,318
When he was in the middle
of beating the shit out of me.

483
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,472
- Which we've only got your word about!
- Angela, for Christ sakes.

484
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,273
Why are you never on my side, Robbie?

485
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,238
I'm always on your side
when you're not being a cunt!

486
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,152
- Hey!
- There will be no more "cunts"

487
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,391
- in this house. You got that, mister?
- What, are you moving out?

488
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,713
It was a ga...
it's a ga... it was a gag.

489
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,154
Are you gonna let me
borrow the car or what?

490
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,514
Why don't you just walk, Angela?
Why don't you just walk?

491
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,432
You know what? I will walk.

492
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,157
I will walk! And you know what else?

493
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,039
- I hope I get raped on the way!
- Yeah, well, I hope

494
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,634
you get raped on the way too!

495
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,431
<i>We're gonna need to keep you
in a few days, Bill.</i>

496
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,354
<i>You shouldn't be
coughing up blood.</i>

497
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,516
Yeah. Kinda guessed that, Doc.

498
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,790
I'll swing by in the morning.

499
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,517
Anne.

500
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,993
I guess I'll go
get your coat, huh?

501
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,799
Well, you know
I ain't staying.

502
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,395
You know I ain't arguing.

503
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,597
Oops.

504
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,756
You old cunt.

505
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,394
I'm not old, Robbie.

506
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,000
That's Dad.

507
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,720
Hey, Dad. How's it going?

508
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,516
Where's the crazy lady?

509
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,951
Kid's got Rice fucking Krispies
in his fucking hair.

510
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,036
What's going on around here?

511
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,715
And What the fuck is going on
with these fucking billboards, Mildred?

512
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,280
Kinda self-explanatory.

513
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,158
Well, why don't you just explain it to me?

514
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,232
Guess it ain't self-explanatory, then.

515
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,359
Well, you know, I guess
I wanted certain people's minds

516
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,318
kept on certain people's jobs, is all.

517
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,956
I hadn't heard from them
in seven goddamn months.

518
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,311
I tell you this,
I've heard an awful lot from them

519
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,993
since I put them
billboards up.

520
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,356
You think this has focused
their minds? Mmm?

521
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,073
I'll tell you what
it's focused their minds on.

522
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,119
It's focused their minds on
how exactly are they gonna fuck you up.

523
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,351
The more you keep a case
in the public eye,

524
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,352
the better your chances
are of getting it solved.

525
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,798
It's in all the guidebooks, Charlie.

526
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,593
How much these billboards cost?

527
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,239
About the same
as a tractor-trailer.

528
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,717
- What the fuck are you laughing at?
- Nothing.

529
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,360
Laughed at by a guy
with fucking cereal in his hair.

530
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,798
- How's Penelope?
- Huh? She's all right.

531
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,070
Why don't you invite her in?

532
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,514
Save leaving her sitting out there.

533
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,671
- She here?
- She's out in the car.

534
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,154
Oh, that explains it.

535
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,036
- That explains what?
- I know I smelt something.

536
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,869
Let her go!

537
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,558
Oh! Um, I kinda need
to use the bathroom,

538
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,075
but if it's inconvenient...
actually, it is inconvenient, isn't it?

539
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,117
I can see it's inconvenient.
I can hold it. It's all right.

540
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,600
It's the first door down the hall.

541
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,876
Are you sure?
I feel like I'm... intruding.

542
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,792
- Just go pee.
- Oh.

543
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,836
Look, you said what you came to say,

544
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,195
so why don't you go get zoo girl

545
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,033
and get the hell
out of my house, all right?

546
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,875
Um, actually, zoo-wise, they were
letting people go at the zoo,

547
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,078
unfortunately, and it was a case
of "last in, first out,"

548
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,516
so yeah, unfortunately,
the zoo had to let me go.

549
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,069
But they were looking for people down
at the horse rides for the disableds

550
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,640
to look after the horses down there.

551
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,073
So I'm working down there now,
looking after the disableds' horses.

552
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,433
- Don't say a word.
- I wasn't gonna say a word.

553
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,552
You don't think I don't wish
it had never happened?

554
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,278
You don't think I don't wish
she was still here?

555
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,750
I know you do.

556
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,070
I know you do.

557
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,951
Billboards ain't gonna
bring her back, Mildred.

558
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,153
Neither is fucking 19-year-olds, Charlie.

559
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:48,991
Yeah?

560
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,354
But I know that.

561
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,630
Just go.

562
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,555
Yeah, all right.

563
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,913
I'm such a shitty dad,
and you're such a great mom. All right.

564
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,353
So how come a week before she died

565
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,239
she comes around asking if she can
move in with me at my place?

566
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,870
'Cause she couldn't stand the two of you
bitching at each other no more,

567
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,952
- fighting with each other no more.
- I don't believe you.

568
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,997
And I said, "No. Stay at home.
Your mom loves you."

569
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,951
Now I wish I hadn't.

570
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,232
'Cause if I hadn't,
she'd still fucking be here.

571
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,436
I don't believe you!

572
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,556
Don't believe me.

573
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,070
Ask Froot Loop boy.

574
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,197
Is that true?

575
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,234
I don't know, Mom.

576
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,275
Yeah, you do.

577
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,990
<i>What's the matter?</i>

578
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,677
<i>Nothing.</i>

579
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,878
Oh, come on,
not Donald Sutherland again.

580
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,156
What is this, frickin'
Donald Sutherland season?

581
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,672
I like him. I like his hair.

582
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,671
Hair?

583
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,590
This is the one
where his little girl dies.

584
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,916
Always a plus in a movie.

585
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,200
Talking of dead kids,

586
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,711
what's happening with the billboard lady?

587
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,156
Oh, that kooz won't listen to reason.

588
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,515
She's tough as an old boot.

589
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,877
Oh.

590
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,075
Why don't you just fuck her over
through her friends then?

591
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,037
Huh?

592
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,271
You know, why don't you
fuck her friends over?

593
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,034
Bring her around that way.

594
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,396
She got any friends you can fuck over?

595
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,114
Rat bastards.

596
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,632
- Hey, fuckhead!
- What?

597
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,396
Don't say, "What," Dixon,
when she comes in calling you a fuckhead!

598
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,880
- And don't you come in here...
- Shut up!

599
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,591
You, get over here.

600
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,912
No! You, get over here.

601
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,469
- All right.
- What? Don't! Dixon!

602
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,276
- What?
- You do not allow a member of the public

603
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,158
to call you a fuckhead
in the station house!

604
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,913
That's what I'm doing!
I'm taking care of it

605
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,515
in my own way, actually.
Now get out of my ass.

606
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,593
Mrs. Hayes, have a seat.
What is it I can do for you today?

607
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,639
- Where's Denise Watson?
- Denise Watson's in the clanger.

608
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,393
- On what charge?
- Possession.

609
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,400
- Of what?
- Two marijuana cigarettes.

610
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,357
Big ones.

611
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,358
- When's the bail hearing?
- I asked the judge not to give her bail

612
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,394
on account of her previous
marijuana violations,

613
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,800
and the judge said, "Sure."

614
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,916
You fucking prick!

615
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,669
You do not call an officer
of the law a fucking prick

616
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,951
in his own station house,
Mrs. Hayes.

617
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,600
Or anywhere, actually.

618
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,913
What's with the new attitude, Dixon?

619
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,353
Your momma been coaching ya?

620
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,111
No.

621
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:09,951
My momma...

622
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,631
doesn't do that.

623
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,517
Take them down, you hear me?

624
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,993
You did good, Dixon.

625
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,953
Yeah, I know I did.

626
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,556
Almost got that.

627
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,711
The rules here are twofold.

628
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,517
No kid can leave
this goddamn blanket

629
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,592
at any goddamn time.

630
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,957
And every single one

631
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,680
of these dolls
and these teddy bears

632
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,911
has got to be hooked up.

633
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,759
Now, your momma and I,

634
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,394
although it won't look like it,

635
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,632
we'll be watching every
goddamn move you make.

636
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,194
So the most important thing
while we are watching you

637
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,195
is that you do not
leave this blanket.

638
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:02,711
Next most important thing,
you do not at any stage

639
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,197
allow the fishing rods

640
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,591
to stick into you
or your sister's eyeballs,

641
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,479
as this would be
counter-productive

642
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,870
to the entire operation.

643
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,150
What would it be?

644
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:20,550
Counter-productive
to the entire operation.

645
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,596
Then, troops...

646
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,715
start fishing.

647
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,554
We are not.

648
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,031
We are.

649
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,630
Yes.

650
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,037
Yes.

651
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,477
Yes.

652
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,079
Hey, baby.

653
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,998
Yup, still no arrests.

654
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,955
How come, I wonder?

655
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,632
Because there ain't no God,
the whole world's empty,

656
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,393
and it doesn't matter
what we do to each other?

657
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,835
I hope not.

658
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,272
How come you came up here
outta nowhere looking so pretty?

659
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,314
You ain't trying to make me believe
in reincarnation or something, are ya?

660
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,637
'Cause you're pretty, but you ain't her.

661
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,830
She got killed...

662
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,399
and now she's dead forever.

663
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,319
I do thank you
for coming though.

664
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,557
If I had some food
I'd give it to you.

665
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,320
All I got is some Doritos,

666
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,312
and they might kill you.
They're kind of pointy.

667
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,795
Then where would we be?

668
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,676
Yeah, so I, uh,
just happened to be looking

669
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,549
over our contract
that we drew up back that time.

670
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,199
What I realized was I...

671
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,674
I realized that
although payment is to be made

672
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,560
on the first day
of each month,

673
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,758
the first payment you paid
was actually a deposit.

674
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,074
Wasn't it? It's like we said.

675
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,753
So, actually, in point of fact,

676
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,560
you're actually behind
in your payments now,

677
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,438
by, yeah, a month.

678
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,400
Yeah, that's, uh...

679
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,992
It's what the contract says,
looking over it and all.

680
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,119
Lawyer says so too.

681
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,152
When you need this next payment by, Red?

682
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,795
Well, now, really.

683
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,790
Or by... uh...

684
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,912
- Friday?
- Wow.

685
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,397
When you can't trust the lawyers
and the advertising men,

686
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,278
what the hell's America coming to, huh?

687
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,236
Who got to you, Red?

688
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,796
Willoughby?

689
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,474
- Nobody got to me.
- My fat fucking ass.

690
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,232
- He's dying, Mildred.
- We're all fucking dying!

691
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,033
- Red!
- Hi, Pamela. We're a little bit busy

692
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,157
- at the moment, if that's okay.
- Red. Oh, Red, I know...

693
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,550
I know you were real anxious
about talking to Mrs. Hayes this morning.

694
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,995
Anxious? No.

695
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,754
No, but that's the thing. There's no need
to be, because you won't believe it!

696
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,595
Little Mexican delivery boy
just dropped in with this.

697
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,039
- What the hell is this?
- I know!

698
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,033
It's $5,000!
And guess what the note says?

699
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,675
It says to pay for the rental
on Mrs. Hayes's billboards.

700
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,956
Can you believe it?
That's why I butted in.

701
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,396
- Well, who's it from?
- Well, doesn't say.

702
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,035
Well, where's the delivery boy?

703
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:15,957
Well, he went.

704
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,799
Well, did you see
what company he was from?

705
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,400
- Well, no.
- What kind of uniform did he have on?

706
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,640
Well, he just looked like one
of those fat little Mexican boys.

707
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,831
On a bicycle.

708
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,396
Oh.

709
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,835
- Did I do something wrong?
- No, no, Pam, you did good.

710
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,957
Yeah, Pamela, you did real good.

711
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,913
Did I? Oh, great.

712
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,517
Ain't life crazy?

713
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,030
What's the note say, Red?

714
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,431
Says here, "This here money is
to go towards the fund

715
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,159
"for Mildred Hayes's billboards,

716
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,152
"'cause she ain't
the only one 'round here

717
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,277
"who hates the pigs.
Signed, a friend."

718
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,560
I guess you can't be too picky about who
your friends are these days, huh?

719
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,676
Uh-huh, um...

720
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,396
I guess I'll be needing
a receipt off you there, Red,

721
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,319
you know, saying the price of next month

722
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,550
is paid in full and all.

723
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,194
Oh, sure, Mildred, sure.

724
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,557
- Like now.
- Oh, sure.

725
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,474
Is Mommy drunk, Daddy?

726
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,480
No, no. She's just got
a little migraine, is all.

727
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,791
Little... Chardonnay migraine.

728
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,760
Now, no more chit-chat
outta you two, okay?

729
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,876
Can we stay home from school
again tomorrow, Daddy?

730
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,400
We'll see what your mommy
says in the morning, darling.

731
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,875
Aw!

732
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,833
Eyes closed...

733
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,072
and go to sleep, okay?

734
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,638
You don't smell like puke,
which is good.

735
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,596
Aquafresh. Trick I learned.

736
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,480
Women, huh?

737
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,796
But it's still your turn
to clean the horseshit

738
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,200
outta the stable, you know.

739
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,198
Those fucking horses.

740
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,840
They're your fucking horses.

741
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,798
I'm gonna have those
fucking horses shot!

742
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,198
I'll do it...
you lazy bitch.

743
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,037
Thank you, Poppa.

744
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,114
That was a real nice day.

745
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,318
That was a real nice fuck.

746
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,118
You got a real nice cock,
Mr. Willoughby.

747
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,433
Is that from a play?

748
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,031
"You got a real nice cock,
Mr. Willoughby."

749
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:51,716
I think I heard that
in a Shakespeare one time.

750
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,870
You dummy.

751
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,359
It's Oscar Wilde.

752
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,512
Ah.

753
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,873
Oscar Wilde.

754
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,034
<i>My darling Anne,</i>

755
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,518
<i>there's a longer letter
in the dresser drawer</i>

756
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,671
<i>I've been writing
for the last week or so.</i>

757
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:31,232
<i>That one covers us
and my memories of us</i>

758
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,399
<i>and how much I've always loved you.</i>

759
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,717
<i>This one just covers tonight,
and more importantly, today.</i>

760
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,589
<i>Tonight I've gone out
to the horses to end it.</i>

761
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,630
<i>I cannot say sorry for the act itself,</i>

762
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,592
<i>although I know that for a short time</i>

763
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,752
<i>you will be angry at me
or even hate me for it.</i>

764
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,115
<i>Please don't.</i>

765
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,714
<i>This is not a case of,
"I came in this world alone</i>

766
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,120
<i>"and I'm going
out of it alone,"</i>

767
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,714
<i>or anything dumb like that.</i>

768
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,632
<i>I did not come in this world alone,</i>

769
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,790
<i>my mom was there.</i>

770
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,552
<i>And I am not going out of it alone,</i>

771
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,316
<i>'cause you are there,</i>

772
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,310
<i>drunk on the couch,
making Oscar Wilde cockjokes.</i>

773
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,512
<i>No, this is a case,
in some senses, of bravery.</i>

774
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,316
<i>Not the bravery
of facing a bullet down.</i>

775
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,033
<i>The next few months of pain</i>

776
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,794
<i>would be far harder
than that small flash.</i>

777
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,712
<i>No, it's the bravery
of weighing up</i>

778
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,315
<i>the next few months
of still being with you...</i>

779
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:31,352
<i>still waking up with you,
of playing with the kids...</i>

780
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,795
<i>against the next few months
of seeing in your eyes</i>

781
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,270
<i>how much my pain
is killing you,</i>

782
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,154
<i>how my weakened body,
as it ebbs away,</i>

783
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,594
<i>and you tend to it,</i>

784
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,635
<i>are your final and lasting memories of me.</i>

785
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,910
<i>I won't have that.</i>

786
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,518
<i>Your final memories of me
will be us at the riverside</i>

787
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,832
<i>and that dumb fishing game,
which I think they cheated at...</i>

788
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,479
<i>and me inside of you
and you on top of me...</i>

789
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:03,155
<i>and barely a fleeting thought
of the darkness yet to come.</i>

790
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,600
<i>That was the best, Anne.</i>

791
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,469
<i>A whole day of not thinking about it.</i>

792
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,034
<i>Dwell on this day, baby,</i>

793
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,271
<i>'cause it was the best day of my life.</i>

794
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,800
<i>Kiss the girls for me,</i>

795
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,679
<i>and know that I've always loved you,</i>

796
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,554
<i>and maybe I'll see you again
if there's another place.</i>

797
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,516
<i>And if there ain't, well,
it's been heaven knowing you.</i>

798
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:27,917
<i>Your boy...</i>

799
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:30,757
<i>Bill.</i>

800
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,077
What the hell's going on around here?

801
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,271
What?

802
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:03,950
Can you stand now?

803
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,800
Yeah, I can stand.

804
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,880
I'd better get out there...

805
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,389
say something to 'em.

806
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,354
You ain't gonna faint again, are ya?

807
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:48,395
<i>I know that the best thing...</i>

808
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:53,440
<i>the only thing to honor
that man's memory right now</i>

809
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,000
<i>is to go to work...</i>

810
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:56,870
<i>is to be a...</i>

811
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:58,877
<i>a good cop...</i>

812
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,233
<i>to walk in his shoes...</i>

813
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,197
<i>and do what he did
every day of his life.</i>

814
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:07,671
<i>Help people.</i>

815
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,274
What the hell's going on?

816
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,996
Where are you going, boy?

817
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,311
You fucking pig!
What the fuck are you...

818
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,480
Shut up.

819
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,872
See, Red, I got issues
with white folks too.

820
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,235
Fuck you looking at?

821
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,234
<i>Reports, sadly, have come in overnight,</i>

822
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,789
<i>that Chief William Willoughby
of Ebbing, Missouri,</i>

823
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,156
<i>took his own life
early this morning</i>

824
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,674
<i>in the grounds of his home.</i>

825
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:09,480
<i>This reportjust in
from Gabriella Forrester.</i>

826
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,160
<i>Tragedy came calling today</i>

827
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:14,517
<i>upon this quiet family home
outside Ebbing, Missouri.</i>

828
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,956
A home belonging
to Chief William Willoughby,

829
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,398
his wife, Anne, their two
young daughters, Polly and Jane.

830
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,676
<i>What appears to be
a self-inflicted gunshot wound</i>

831
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,911
<i>brought life to an end
for Chief Willoughby,</i>

832
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,072
<i>a man highly-respected in Ebbing</i>

833
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,720
<i>for his diligence
and service to the community.</i>

834
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,680
<i>What led him to take his life</i>

835
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,433
<i>in the early hours of this morning,</i>

836
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,398
<i>it is too early to speculate.</i>

837
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,035
<i>There were rumors of illness.</i>

838
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,238
<i>Could it simply have been
the pressures of the job?</i>

839
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,076
<i>Or could it have something
to do with a story</i>

840
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,715
<i>we ran here just two weeks ago</i>

841
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:50,319
<i>of these billboards and the woman
who put them there, Mildred Hayes?</i>

842
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,636
Don't. Don't!

843
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:12,391
Hi, there.

844
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,996
- You know who threw that can?
- What can?

845
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,351
How about you, sweetheart?
You know who threw that can?

846
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,716
Uh, no, I didn't really...

847
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:33,557
Thank you, Mom.

848
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,070
And what can I do for you today, sir?

849
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,230
What's your name?

850
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,478
Name's on my tag, man.
You hard of reading?

851
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,357
Hard of reading? No, no.

852
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,635
That's good, "hard of reading."

853
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,870
Kinda like "hard of hearing,"

854
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,118
but it's actually "hard of reading."

855
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,194
Like a play on words
or something, huh?

856
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:07,150
What do you want?

857
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,311
I've been sent down to take over from...

858
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,710
Chief Willoughby in light
of last night's unfortunate event.

859
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,520
You have got to be
fucking kidding me!

860
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,912
Do you have
any documentation to prove that, sir?

861
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:24,589
You really wanna see
my documentation, fucker?

862
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:28,469
Yeah, see his documentation!
Make him show it to you.

863
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:33,071
None of you cracker motherfuckers
got no work to do?

864
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:37,951
Ain't that racist?

865
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,551
What happened to your hand,
Officer Dixon?

866
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:46,870
Oh, I just kinda...

867
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,395
banged it up a little bit

868
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,836
while I was throwing some guy
out a fucking window.

869
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,560
- You know, the usual.
- Oh yeah?

870
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,311
They never taught me
that one at the academy.

871
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,751
Which fucking academy you go to?

872
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,554
How are things
coming along on that Angela Hayes case?

873
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,234
How's things coming along on
the mind-your-own-fucking-business case?

874
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,436
How are things coming along

875
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,876
on the hand me your gun and your badge?

876
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:16,437
What? Huh?

877
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,354
Hand me your gun and your badge.

878
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,110
Shit.

879
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,389
In here somewhere.

880
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:05,072
Hey, listen, I can't find my badge.

881
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,594
No, seriously. Maybe I lost it.

882
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:10,110
You know, dropped it
when I was doing that window guy.

883
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,954
Just get the fuck
out of my station house, man.

884
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,799
What's going on?

885
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:42,037
I think I...

886
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,200
I think I just got fired.

887
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,756
Fired or suspended,
I'm not sure which.

888
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:48,830
Fired.

889
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,757
Anything I can help you with,
just give me a holler.

890
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,079
Give Mildred Hayes...

891
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,230
a holler.

892
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:33,631
Okay.

893
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:36,431
You know me?

894
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,799
Only from the TV... and the radio.

895
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,840
How much these here
"Welcome to Missouri" rabbits go for?

896
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:52,631
Seven bucks.

897
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,270
It's writ right on them.

898
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:03,919
Guess he ain't seven bucks now.

899
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:07,880
What you come in here for?

900
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,435
What I come in here for?

901
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,951
Well, maybe I'm a good friend
of Willoughby's. How about that?

902
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,191
Are you?

903
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:16,997
Or, you know...

904
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,598
Maybe I was a friend of
your daughter or something.

905
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,196
How about that?

906
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:27,957
Were you?

907
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,470
Or, uh...

908
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,270
You know, maybe I was the one

909
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,760
who fucked her
while she was dying.

910
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,076
How about that?

911
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,390
Were you?

912
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:47,750
No.

913
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,590
I would have liked to.

914
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,120
I saw her picture in the paper there.

915
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,197
Saved by the bell, huh?

916
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:03,036
You owe me seven fucking
dollars for the rabbit.

917
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:07,559
Guess you'll have to get it off me next
time I'm passing through, huh, Mildred?

918
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:08,551
Guess I will.

919
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,476
You don't know how glad I am to see you.

920
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,591
- What?
- That guy was trying to scare me.

921
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,873
I wouldn't have said you scare easy.

922
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:27,556
I ain't the worst.

923
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,920
What can I do for you, ma'am?

924
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,795
My husband left this for you

925
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,031
before he shot himself
in the head last night.

926
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,518
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Willoughby. I...
- Are you?

927
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,833
- Are you really?
- Sure, I am.

928
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:47,230
Well, surely this is
the perfect ending for you, isn't it?

929
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:51,077
It's proof that they were successful,
those billboards of yours,

930
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,594
isn't it? A dead policeman?

931
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:55,514
- It's quantifiable now.
- Are you blaming this on me?

932
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:56,511
No.

933
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,555
I'm not blaming this on you.

934
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,960
I just came
to give you the letter.

935
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:04,036
Now my little girls are out in the car,

936
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,713
so I'd better not stay and chat.

937
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,036
I'm not quite sure what
we're gonna do for the rest of the day.

938
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:14,191
It's hard to know what to do

939
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,636
the day your husband kills himself.

940
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:18,515
It's hard to know what to do.

941
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:49,631
<i>Dear Mildred...</i>

942
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,034
<i>Dead Man Willoughby here.</i>

943
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:55,155
<i>Firstly, I wanted to apologize for dying</i>

944
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,232
<i>without catching your daughter's killer.</i>

945
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,513
<i>It's a source of great pain to me,</i>

946
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,114
<i>and it would break my heart to think</i>

947
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,874
<i>you thought I didn't care,
'cause I did care.</i>

948
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,480
<i>There are just some cases...</i>

949
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:08,639
<i>where you never catch a break...</i>

950
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,199
<i>then five years down the line</i>

951
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,397
<i>some guy hears some other guy</i>

952
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:16,678
<i>bragging about it
in a bar room or a jail cell</i>

953
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:18,800
<i>and the whole thing is wrapped up</i>

954
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,394
<i>through sheer stupidity.</i>

955
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:23,719
<i>I hope that might be true for Angela.
I really do.</i>

956
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:27,114
<i>Second, I gotta admit, Mildred,</i>

957
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,800
<i>the billboards were a great fucking idea.</i>

958
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,193
<i>They were like a chess move.</i>

959
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,632
<i>And although they had absolutely nothing</i>

960
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,074
<i>to do with my dying...</i>

961
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,194
<i>I'm sure that everyone in town</i>

962
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,634
<i>will assume that they did,</i>

963
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,556
<i>which is why,
for Willoughby's counter-move,</i>

964
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:45,275
<i>I decided to pay
the next month's rent on 'em.</i>

965
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,593
<i>I thought it'd be funny,
you having to defend 'em</i>

966
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:51,752
<i>a whole nother month
after they've stuck me in the ground.</i>

967
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,031
<i>The joke is on you, Mildred, ha ha,</i>

968
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,077
<i>and I hope they do not kill you.</i>

969
01:08:58,520 --> 01:08:59,840
<i>So good luck with all that,</i>

970
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,877
<i>and good luck with everything else too.</i>

971
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:05,712
<i>I hope and I pray that you get him.</i>

972
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:26,753
Well, you want me
to go down and talk to 'em?

973
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,632
No, I don't want you
to go down and talk to 'em.

974
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,034
Somebody sending their goddamn mother

975
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,713
down to talk to the goddamn police?

976
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:38,990
To say what?

977
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:41,800
To say to give you
your job back.

978
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:43,520
Get rid of that black guy.

979
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,800
Ain't gonna listen to some guy's mother

980
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,473
asking them to get rid of some black guy.

981
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,593
Things have moved on in the South.

982
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:52,875
Well, it shouldn't have!

983
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:58,995
Will they give you some money
for being laid off and all?

984
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:03,036
I don't know what
the compensation scheme is

985
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,952
for when you throw a guy
out of a window, Ma.

986
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,399
Guess I should have looked
into that beforehand.

987
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:08,516
Let me Google that.

988
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,353
A couple of grand, maybe?

989
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:13,833
You been there three years.

990
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:17,757
Not counting the five years
at the academy.

991
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:19,917
Six...

992
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,632
if you count the year
you were held back.

993
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,356
Where are you going?

994
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:28,550
None of your business.

995
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:31,318
Off to see your fancy woman?

996
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:35,755
- I don't got a fancy woman.
- Yeah. I know.

997
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:38,480
Hey. You wanna watch yourself.

998
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:40,552
Or-or... or you'll do what?

999
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:46,715
I'll blow your goddamn head off,
that's what.

1000
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,636
Oh, did you hear the news?

1001
01:10:58,720 --> 01:10:59,756
What news?

1002
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,433
That Dixon guy threw that Welby guy

1003
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:02,795
out of his window this morning.

1004
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,029
You're shitting me.

1005
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:11,397
Is he okay?

1006
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,316
Mmm-mmm.

1007
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:19,793
- You're shitting me!
- Whoa!

1008
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,754
Holy shit! Holy shit!

1009
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,920
Holy shit!

1010
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,150
Fuck!

1011
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,074
Go get the other one from the house.

1012
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,913
Shouldn't I call the fire department?

1013
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,390
Fuck the fire department.
They probably started it.

1014
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:37,749
Don't do anything stupid!

1015
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:40,590
Scumbags!

1016
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:42,956
Fucking, fucking scumbags!

1017
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:17,710
Shit!

1018
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,234
All right!

1019
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:42,720
Are you kidding me?

1020
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,831
Mom! What the hell are you doing?

1021
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:01,032
- Yeah. Okay. All right. Good. Come on.
- Leave it! Ma, please!

1022
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,190
It's too late!

1023
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:07,391
- Robbie.
- Leave it! Please!

1024
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:08,470
Robbie!

1025
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:39,389
How are those hands?

1026
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,633
Give us a minute here. Thank you.

1027
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:48,509
Can I ask you a couple of questions?

1028
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,958
Can ask me all the questions you want,

1029
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,156
you take me down and arrest me.

1030
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,480
I'm not gonna arrest you, Mrs. Hayes.

1031
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,914
I got nothing to arrest you for.

1032
01:13:58,440 --> 01:13:59,669
Not yet you ain't.

1033
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:07,992
We ain't all the enemy, you know.

1034
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,676
I'll crucify the motherfuckers.

1035
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:42,799
What are you gonna do, Mildred?

1036
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:44,389
You gonna crucify 'em?

1037
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,351
Yeah, I'm gonna crucify 'em.

1038
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,634
Who you gonna crucify?

1039
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:51,396
The motherfuckers?

1040
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:56,116
Yeah, I'm gonna crucify the motherfuckers.

1041
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:58,833
Ooh, then those motherfuckers

1042
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:01,230
better watch out, all right?

1043
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:06,556
Fucking A.

1044
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:11,996
Oh, what's this shit?

1045
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:13,994
And as sad as the spectacle

1046
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,231
of these burned out billboards might be,

1047
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:18,000
in light of the death of Chief Willoughby,

1048
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,356
this reporter for one

1049
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,113
wonders if this finally puts an end

1050
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:23,669
to the strange saga
of the three billboards outside...

1051
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,991
This doesn't put an end to shit,
you fucking retard!

1052
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,560
This is just the fucking start!

1053
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,597
<i>Why don't you put that
on your Good Morning Missouri</i>

1054
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:31,797
<i>fucking Wake Up broadcast, bitch!</i>

1055
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:44,075
I see on the TV
there were a bunch of fires

1056
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:46,152
lit outside of town last night.

1057
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,229
Bunch of fires, huh?

1058
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,398
Out at those billboards.

1059
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,080
Yeah, well, back when I was a cop,

1060
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,038
I would have been interested
in who set those fires,

1061
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,600
because, technically, that's arson.

1062
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:02,197
But, as I'm no longer
employed by those people,

1063
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:04,272
I don't really give a good goddamn,
now do I?

1064
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,271
I'll get it.

1065
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:15,236
Dixon residence.

1066
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:17,273
<i>Hey, Dixon, it's Cedric.</i>

1067
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,035
Oh, hey, Sarge. Got any news?

1068
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,758
<i>- News about what?
- I don't know.</i>

1069
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,434
About my job and stuff?

1070
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,717
No. No. What?

1071
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:31,076
No. Uh...

1072
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:34,070
Anne Willoughby just dropped in a letter

1073
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:36,675
that... Bill wrote you before he died.

1074
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:37,989
What's it say?

1075
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,356
Oh, I haven't read it, Dixon.
It's not my letter.

1076
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,593
Oh, well, listen,
I'll... I'll come right down.

1077
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:44,990
Um, I'll be there
in like 15 minutes.

1078
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,395
Well... Uh...

1079
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:50,273
Yeah, I d...
I don't think that'd be such a great idea,

1080
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,556
things as they stand, Jason.

1081
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,160
<i>You... you still got your keys</i>

1082
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:56,152
<i>to the station house, though, right?</i>

1083
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:57,230
Yeah.

1084
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:59,789
<i>Well, why don't you come and pick it up</i>

1085
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,109
<i>after everyone's gone home?</i>

1086
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,759
<i>I can leave it on your desk for you.</i>

1087
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:06,596
Oh, okay.

1088
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,360
<i>Actually, yeah, then...</i>

1089
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,839
when you're done, you can... you can...

1090
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,554
just leave the keys...

1091
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:16,473
you know, save us picking 'em up later.

1092
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:20,637
All right.

1093
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,757
<i>Jason, Willoughby here.</i>

1094
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,036
<i>I'm dead now. Sorry about that.</i>

1095
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,993
<i>There's something I wanted to say to you</i>

1096
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,356
<i>that I never really said when I was alive.</i>

1097
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,520
<i>I think you've got the makings</i>

1098
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,513
<i>of being a really good cop, Jason.</i>

1099
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:04,590
<i>And you know why?</i>

1100
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:09,791
<i>Because deep down you're a decent man.</i>

1101
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:12,238
<i>I know you don't think I think that,</i>

1102
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,073
<i>but I do, dipshit.</i>

1103
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:23,630
<i>I do think you're too angry, though.</i>

1104
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,396
<i>And I know it's all since your dad died</i>

1105
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,915
<i>and you had to go
look after your mom and all.</i>

1106
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:37,795
<i>But as long as you hold on
to so much hate, then I don't think</i>

1107
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,439
<i>you're ever gonna become...</i>

1108
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,514
<i>...what I know you wanna become.</i>

1109
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,036
<i>A detective.</i>

1110
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,279
<i>Because you know what you need</i>

1111
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:55,510
<i>to become a detective?</i>

1112
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,677
<i>And I know you're gonna wince
when I say this...</i>

1113
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:05,399
<i>But what you need
to become a detective... is love.</i>

1114
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:07,996
Fuck 'em.

1115
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:18,074
<i>Because through love comes calm,</i>

1116
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:20,197
<i>and through calm comes thought.</i>

1117
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:24,476
<i>And you need thought
to detect stuff sometimes, Jason.</i>

1118
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,189
<i>It's kinda all you need.</i>

1119
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,474
<i>You don't even need a gun.</i>

1120
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,559
<i>And you definitely don't need hate.</i>

1121
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:38,033
<i>Hate never solved nothing.</i>

1122
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,600
<i>But calm did. And thought did.</i>

1123
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:48,400
<i>Try it. Try it just for a change.</i>

1124
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,759
<i>No one will think you're gay.</i>

1125
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,833
<i>And if they do,
arrest them for homophobia.</i>

1126
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:56,634
<i>Won't they be surprised?</i>

1127
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:00,999
<i>Good luck to you, Jason.
You're a decent man.</i>

1128
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:03,511
<i>And yeah, you've had a run of bad luck...</i>

1129
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:08,477
<i>but things are gonna change
for you. I can feel it.</i>

1130
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:39,756
Calm.

1131
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:41,910
Calm.

1132
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,397
Calm.

1133
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:06,630
So, what'd you see?

1134
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,871
Well, when we turned
the corner from Spring,

1135
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,795
the fire was already raging,

1136
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,920
and about two seconds later the cop fella,

1137
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,514
- he just jumps out of the window.
- Wait.

1138
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,836
The two of you turned
the corner from Spring?

1139
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:22,271
- Where were you before this?
- Round... round my place.

1140
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:27,120
You two boyfriend and girlfriend?

1141
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:31,874
Early stages, you know.

1142
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:34,431
Is that right?

1143
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,440
We had a couple dates.

1144
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:48,479
You wanna go out to dinner
with me next week?

1145
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,198
Yeah, I'll go out to dinner with ya.

1146
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,269
But I ain't gonna fuck ya.

1147
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:00,111
Well, I... I ain't gonna fuck you neither.

1148
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:03,917
I guess.

1149
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,714
Burn victim.
He's pretty heavily sedated.

1150
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:32,071
Hey, man.

1151
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:34,991
You doing okay? Jeez.

1152
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:38,276
You got burned up pretty bad, huh?

1153
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:42,115
You'll be okay though.

1154
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:45,877
You, uh... you want
a glass of orange juice?

1155
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,271
I got a straw somewhere.

1156
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:51,076
Hey, hey.

1157
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:53,511
Don't cry.

1158
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:57,240
You'll be... you'll be okay.

1159
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:02,159
I... I'm sorry, Welby.

1160
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,117
- You know me?
- I'm sorry.

1161
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,513
You're sorry... sorry for what?

1162
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:16,199
For throwing you out the window.

1163
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:25,110
I'm sorry, man.

1164
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:26,236
I don't care!

1165
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,557
Stop fucking crying, God damn it!

1166
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,118
The salt'll just fuck up your wounds.

1167
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:35,189
I thought salt
was supposed to be good for your wounds.

1168
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,273
What am I, a fucking doctor?

1169
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:48,311
Who is it?

1170
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:50,114
Oh, you don't know me really.

1171
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,630
Well, what do you want?

1172
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:57,399
I come about the billboards.

1173
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:00,395
- What about 'em?
- They got burned up.

1174
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:01,677
I know that.

1175
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:05,116
I'm one of the guys
who put 'em up in the first place.

1176
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:10,237
Jerome.

1177
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:13,556
What can I do for you, Jerome?

1178
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,676
Well, when you put up
a bunch of posters like that,

1179
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:19,912
just in case any of them
get screwed up or torn, they, uh...

1180
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,276
give you a set of duplicates, you know?

1181
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,114
No, I didn't know that.

1182
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:36,475
Ladder's pretty steady
as it is there, James.

1183
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:40,634
Oh... oh, that's okay.
I... I like holding ladders.

1184
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,070
Takes me out of myself.

1185
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,840
- Need a hand?
- Hey!

1186
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,912
- When'd you get out?
- An hour ago.

1187
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:53,550
Judge threw it out.

1188
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:55,199
Said the arrest report
weren't filled out right.

1189
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:56,191
Mmm.

1190
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:58,191
Say, you...

1191
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:04,840
Say, you didn't burn down
the police station, did you?

1192
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:06,479
No, she was with me the whole night.

1193
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:10,879
- Why would... okay.
- It's a long story.

1194
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:12,356
Hey.

1195
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:13,917
Hey.

1196
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,474
Still wanna put up the Willoughby one,

1197
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:17,676
him being dead and all?

1198
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,878
Why not? He paid for it.

1199
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:21,590
True.

1200
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,274
Look at this fucking asshole.

1201
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:12,716
- First round's on you?
- Yeah.

1202
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,035
Well, here we are.

1203
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:34,356
Here we are.

1204
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,720
I like cheesy things.

1205
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,439
I'm gonna look for cheesy things.

1206
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:42,357
All right.

1207
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:50,551
Who's that?

1208
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:52,549
My ex-husband.

1209
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:55,032
And his 19-year-old girlfriend.

1210
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:00,193
- You wanna leave?
- No, no.

1211
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:01,991
Deal's a deal.

1212
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:05,909
It was fucking wild, man.

1213
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:09,073
I think I was certifiably fucking insane
for a while back there.

1214
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:13,032
- When was this?
- About nine, ten months ago.

1215
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:14,389
Were you on your own or what?

1216
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:15,834
I had a couple of buddies with me.

1217
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:17,793
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1218
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:19,236
They fuck her too?

1219
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:23,120
I think they got their kicks
just watching, you know?

1220
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,592
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1221
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:27,156
Was she hot?

1222
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:29,756
Once the gasoline kicked in
she was hot.

1223
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:33,196
I swear, I wanted
to fuck her even more right then.

1224
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:37,872
I don't know if I could
get that out of my mind.

1225
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:20,960
I ain't going down for that shit,

1226
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,076
last fucking day down there.

1227
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:32,760
- He been there the whole time?
- Who?

1228
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:35,640
Burnt face Jake.
Keeps fucking walking up and down.

1229
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:38,039
I don't know. I don't think so.

1230
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:47,749
- Another round?
- Yeah.

1231
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:52,470
Eight bucks.

1232
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:26,036
Maestro.

1233
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:32,560
Can I help you with something?

1234
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:33,631
Excuse me?

1235
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:36,034
You keep looking over here
all fucking night.

1236
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:37,952
Now, unless you've got
something to say to me,

1237
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,520
why don't you take
your burnt fucking face

1238
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:40,829
and get the fuck out of here, okay?

1239
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:45,516
- No, I... scoot over.
- What are you doing? What are you doing?

1240
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,831
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1241
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:49,635
Just trust me, okay?

1242
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:51,756
You like magic?

1243
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:57,477
- Just trust me.
- Just do the fucking trick, man.

1244
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:00,916
Okay.

1245
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:10,916
What the fuck!

1246
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:14,996
Hey.

1247
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:16,831
Hey!

1248
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:19,477
- Hey! That's enough now!
- What's it to you, fucker?

1249
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:20,789
The guy's a cop, man. He's a cop.

1250
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:21,757
Oh, yeah?

1251
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:24,390
He ain't wearing no badge.

1252
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:26,435
I lost my badge.

1253
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:29,959
Can't remember where I lost it.

1254
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:33,192
Hey, you started this, man!
I didn't do shit to you!

1255
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:35,360
I know I started it.

1256
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,910
I scratched you up
like a bitch.

1257
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,480
That's exactly fucking right.

1258
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:58,231
I'm gonna go use the little boy's room.

1259
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:11,276
You got something to say to me?

1260
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,113
If I'd known, we could have double dated.

1261
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:16,079
Doesn't shit girl have
a curfew weeknights?

1262
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:17,516
No. No.

1263
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:20,513
In fact, I was actually gonna take her
to the circus later,

1264
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:22,910
but there's no need now.
Does he juggle?

1265
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:26,478
Look, I'm having one dinner with the guy,
'cause he did me a favor, okay?

1266
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:28,559
You don't have to explain yourself to me

1267
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:30,313
'cause you're having dinner
with a midget, Mildred.

1268
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,039
I'm not explaining myself to you.

1269
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:33,031
You kind of are.

1270
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:40,990
Look, I didn't come over here
to break your balls.

1271
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:42,992
You can date as many midgets as you want.

1272
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:44,511
No.

1273
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:48,192
No, I came over to say
I was sorry, actually.

1274
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:49,430
Sorry for what?

1275
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:52,197
Sorry about what happened
to your billboards and all.

1276
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:55,273
Yeah, well, it's all water
under the bridge, I guess.

1277
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:56,595
Good.

1278
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:59,912
I'm glad. I was pretty drunk,
but it still don't excuse it.

1279
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:04,000
All this anger, man.

1280
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:06,993
Penelope said to me the other day...

1281
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:10,755
"It just begets greater anger."

1282
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:12,751
You know?

1283
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:14,390
It's true.

1284
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:18,674
Penelope said, "Begets"?

1285
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:21,231
Yeah.

1286
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:24,352
"It begets greater anger."

1287
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:28,637
Well...

1288
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:32,320
You take care of this
little lady, okay, sport?

1289
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:35,196
Big lady compared to you, right?

1290
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:47,317
- You all right?
- I think I wanna go home now.

1291
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:49,115
Don't give me any shit, James.

1292
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:50,554
We'll do it another night, all right?

1293
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,992
Why would I want to do it another night?

1294
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:54,877
You've been...

1295
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:57,399
embarrassed to be here
ever since we arrived.

1296
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:58,709
Oh, for Christ sake.

1297
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:01,277
I didn't force you
to come on this date, all right?

1298
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:02,555
You forced me.

1299
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:05,918
F... forced you?

1300
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:10,034
I asked you on a date.
Wow.

1301
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:12,120
You know...

1302
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:15,511
I know
I'm not that much of a catch.

1303
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:18,476
I know I'm a dwarf who sells used cars

1304
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,279
and has a drinking problem. I know that.

1305
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:22,080
But who the hell are you, man?

1306
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:25,758
You're that billboard lady
who never smiles,

1307
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,752
never has a good word
to say about anybody,

1308
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:29,793
and who, in the evening times,

1309
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:31,599
sets fucking fire to police stations!

1310
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:36,314
And I'm the one who's not a catch?

1311
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:39,471
Hey!

1312
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:44,194
You know, I didn't have to
come and hold your ladder.

1313
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:11,835
Now, don't make a scene.

1314
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:17,834
Did you really tell him
"Anger begets greater anger"?

1315
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:20,677
Oh! Yes! I did.

1316
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:22,035
I didn't make it up
myself though.

1317
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:23,474
I can't claim that.

1318
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:25,517
No, I read it on a bookmark...

1319
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:28,920
which was in a book I was reading...

1320
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:31,836
about polio.

1321
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:36,035
Polo. No.
Which is the one with the horses?

1322
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:37,110
Polio or polo?

1323
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:38,236
- Polo.
- Polo.

1324
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:51,319
Be nice to her, Charlie.

1325
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:54,351
You got that?

1326
01:37:08,160 --> 01:37:09,992
Jason!

1327
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,400
- Jason. Jason!
- Don't look at me.

1328
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:13,039
- Don't look at me!
- What have they done to you?

1329
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:14,713
- Leave me, Momma!
- Are you...

1330
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:16,429
No. No! Oh!

1331
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:18,080
Oh, don't lock me...

1332
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,274
Open up this door!

1333
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:23,639
Please, Jason.

1334
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:27,160
Let me help you. Please.

1335
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:33,636
You're my baby boy.
Open this door.

1336
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:35,670
Please.

1337
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,592
Jason, please.

1338
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:43,996
Please.

1339
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,435
Please open the door.

1340
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:56,795
Open up!

1341
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:00,069
Jason!

1342
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:02,915
I'm all right, Momma.

1343
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:05,234
It's all gonna be all right.

1344
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:31,234
I don't wanna get
your hopes up, all right,

1345
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:32,879
but there is a guy, and I think

1346
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:35,794
<i>he might be the guy. I got his DNA.</i>

1347
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:37,950
Got a lot of it, actually.

1348
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:40,752
They're making the checks as we speak.

1349
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:41,830
He's in jail?

1350
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:45,315
No, but he ain't gonna be hard to find.

1351
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:47,795
Why do you think he's the guy?

1352
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,155
I heard him talking about

1353
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:50,913
something he did to a girl
the middle of last year.

1354
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:53,474
I couldn't hear all of it, but...

1355
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:57,875
It sounded a lot like
what happened to Angela.

1356
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:01,320
And then he beat
the crap out of me.

1357
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:02,870
But because of that...

1358
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:05,073
I got a bunch of his DNA.

1359
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:07,349
So, I wanted to...

1360
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:11,155
let you know sooner rather than later.

1361
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:12,993
I didn't want you
to give up hope, you know?

1362
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:15,715
I've been trying not to.

1363
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:17,351
Well...

1364
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:20,035
all you can do is try.

1365
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:21,520
As my momma says...

1366
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:24,312
not so much about hope as about...

1367
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:29,398
well, I didn't used to be
very good at English at school.

1368
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,354
So it was more
"All you can do is try

1369
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,875
"to not be so crap at English."

1370
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:39,230
Because you need English,
really, if you wanna be a cop.

1371
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:42,476
If you wanna be anything, really.

1372
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:51,072
Unless you live in Mexico or something.

1373
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:54,159
Who wants that?

1374
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:16,396
Hey, Dixon?

1375
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:22,871
Thank you.

1376
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:58,315
You did good, Jason.

1377
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:00,794
You did real good.

1378
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:11,194
But he wasn't the guy.

1379
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:19,791
What?

1380
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:21,993
There was no match to the DNA.

1381
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:24,955
No matches to any other crimes
of this nature.

1382
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:26,873
To any crimes at all, in fact.

1383
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:29,394
And his record is clean.

1384
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:31,989
Maybe he was just bragging.

1385
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:36,073
- He wasn't just bragging.
- Well, that's as may be.

1386
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:37,833
But at the time of Angela's death...

1387
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:39,994
he wasn't even in the country.

1388
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:41,591
Where was he?

1389
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:45,194
Well, I've seen his records
of entry and exit to the States,

1390
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:47,237
and I've spoken to his commanding officer.

1391
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:51,359
He wasn't in the country, Dixon.
He ain't our guy.

1392
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:53,600
Uh, no, he...

1393
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:57,834
He... he might not be our guy,

1394
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:59,513
but he still done something shitty.

1395
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:00,636
I know he did.

1396
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:02,194
Not in Missouri he didn't.

1397
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:03,950
Where was he?

1398
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:06,830
That's classified information.

1399
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:08,354
Oh, come on, man.

1400
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:11,031
If the guy has a commanding officer,

1401
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:14,314
and if the guy got back to the country
nine months ago,

1402
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:17,512
and if the country
where he was is classified,

1403
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,353
which country
do you think he was in?

1404
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:22,549
Hey, you know...

1405
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:26,150
I'll give you a clue.

1406
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:29,436
It was sandy.

1407
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:35,673
That doesn't really narrow it down.

1408
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:40,477
All you need to know is that

1409
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:42,472
he didn't do nothing to Angela Hayes,

1410
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:44,472
so... we're gonna keep looking.

1411
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:51,837
All right?

1412
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:04,838
I found my badge after all.

1413
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:13,717
Hello?

1414
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:15,550
<i>It's Dixon.</i>

1415
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:21,917
Tell me.

1416
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:26,440
He wasn't the guy.

1417
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:43,631
Mildred?

1418
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:55,515
Are you sure?

1419
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:00,912
He... he wasn't even in
the country when it happened.

1420
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:04,269
So, whatever he did...

1421
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:07,600
he didn't do it round here.

1422
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:11,198
<i>I'm sorry I got your hopes up.</i>

1423
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:13,759
Well, that's all right. That's all right.

1424
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:18,280
At least I had a day of hoping,

1425
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:20,079
and that's more than I've had for a while.

1426
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:28,390
I gotta go.

1427
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:33,589
There was, uh...

1428
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:37,152
There was one thing I was thinking.

1429
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:41,356
<i>What's that?</i>

1430
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:44,079
I know he ain't your rapist.

1431
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:49,435
He is a rapist, though.
I'm sure of that.

1432
01:45:58,080 --> 01:45:59,196
What are you saying to me?

1433
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:03,314
Got his license plate.

1434
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:07,994
I know where he lives.

1435
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:12,350
Where's he live?

1436
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:15,949
He lives in Idaho.

1437
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:23,516
That's funny.

1438
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:28,838
I'm driving to Idaho
in the morning.

1439
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:36,035
Want some company?

1440
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:42,791
Sure.

1441
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:27,277
- Hey, Dixon?
- Yeah?

1442
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:29,829
I need to tell you something.

1443
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:34,512
It was me that burned down
the police station.

1444
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:39,439
Why, who the hell else
would it have been?

1445
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:53,116
Dixon?

1446
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:54,910
Yup?

1447
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:59,350
- Are you sure about this?
- About killing this guy?

1448
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:03,792
Not really. You?

1449
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:08,350
Not really.

1450
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:13,193
I guess we can decide
along the way.
