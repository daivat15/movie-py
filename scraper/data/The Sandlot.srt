00:00:56,975 --> 00:01:01,146
There is one all-time greatest
moment in the history of sports,

2
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:05,108
and it happened
in the 1932 World Series.

3
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:08,653
The story goes that in the bottom
of the ninth inning with two outs,

4
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:11,448
a full count
and the tying run on base,

5
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:14,784
Babe Ruth raised his arm and pointed
to the center field bleachers.

6
00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:19,372
No one believed it,
because nobody had ever done it before.

7
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:22,208
But The Babe
was calling his shot.

8
00:01:22,334 --> 00:01:28,173
On the next pitch, the Great Bambino
hit a towering 400-foot home run.

9
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:31,217
And even although he'd been
a hero before that,

10
00:01:31,343 --> 00:01:34,429
that's pretty much
how he became a legend.

11
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:38,683
Thirty years later, a kid named
Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez...

12
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:40,810
became a neighborhood legend.

13
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:43,104
It was in the greatest summer
of my life...

14

when he taught me
to play baseball,

15
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,400
and he became my best friend.

16
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:51,196
And he got me out of the biggest
pickle I'd ever be in.

Okay. You just need a bigger glove.
Throw it back to me this time.

-Just keep that on for, like, an hour.

- What, were you born in a barn, man?

Yeah, what planet
are you from?

no way I could let them know.

- And throw.

- Yeah.

You already fill up all
the empty positions since
Elswenger moved to Arizona.

You just have fun.

I mean, if you were having fun,
you would've caught that ball.

you would throw a paper.

When your arm gets here,
just let go.

20 years ago,

when thieves kept stealing junk
from Mertle's Acres junkyard.

from the dog pound.

and turned the pup loose
in the junkyard.

the pup grew into The Beast.

00:30:00,677 --> 00:30:04,180
And he grew big,
and he grew mean...

450
00:30:04,306 --> 00:30:08,476
so that he could protect the junkyard
with only one thing on his mind:

01:30:42,485 --> 01:30:44,988
You in trouble,
aren't you, son?

1249
01:30:47,490 --> 01:30:50,201
Yeah, well, uh,
that was my stepdad's ball.

1250
01:30:50,327 --> 01:30:53,413
I took it without asking.

1251
01:30:53,496 --> 01:30:57,000
- It was signed by Babe Ruth.
- George signed this?

1252
01:30:57,125 --> 01:30:59,836
George Herman Ruth?
Yeah.

1253
01:30:59,961 --> 01:31:03,965
I take it back. You're not in trouble.
You're dead where you stand.

1254
01:31:06,593 --> 01:31:08,511
Hold on.

1255
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:12,474
Hold on.

1256
01:31:28,198 --> 01:31:30,533
Here.

1257
01:31:32,118 --> 01:31:35,121
I'll trade ya.

1258
01:31:35,205 --> 01:31:38,625
That's nice of you, but that ball
really is signed by Babe Ruth.

1259
01:31:38,708 --> 01:31:43,046
So's this one, with the rest
of the 1927 Yankees.

1260
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:49,302
Oh, man.
Murderer's Row!

1261
01:31:49,386 --> 01:31:51,888
Lou Gehrig!

1262
01:31:51,972 --> 01:31:55,350
[Scotty]
Babe Ruth! But why would you trade?

1263
01:31:55,433 --> 01:31:57,102
That one's all chewed up.

1264
01:31:57,227 --> 01:32:00,021
I got a lot of good stuff.
Look at that stuff.

1265
01:32:00,105 --> 01:32:03,358
Besides, you need it
more than I do.

1266
01:32:17,455 --> 01:32:19,374
You knew Babe Ruth?

1267
01:32:19,457 --> 01:32:23,420
George? I sure did.
And he knew me.

1268
01:32:23,503 --> 01:32:27,215
He was almost as great
a hitter as I was.

1269
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:31,344
- I would've broken his record, but--
- You went blind.

1270
01:32:31,428 --> 01:32:33,888
Yep. I used to crowd the plate...

1271
01:32:33,972 --> 01:32:37,851
so the strike zone
almost disappeared.

1272
01:32:37,934 --> 01:32:40,437
[ Laughs ]
Pitchers hate that.

1273
01:32:41,771 --> 01:32:44,899
That's the way I played--
100% all the time.

1274
01:32:44,983 --> 01:32:48,153
Baseball was life.

1275
01:32:48,278 --> 01:32:51,239
And I was good at it, real good.

1276
01:32:51,364 --> 01:32:53,783
And then... one day,

1277
01:32:53,908 --> 01:32:55,952
a high fast one, and pow,

1278
01:32:56,077 --> 01:32:58,204
lights went out.

1279
01:33:01,207 --> 01:33:04,002
I don't think we
could take this ball.

1280
01:33:04,127 --> 01:33:06,046
I'll tell you what.

1281
01:33:06,129 --> 01:33:10,759
You guys come by once a week
and talk baseball with me,
we'll call it an even trade.

1282
01:33:15,847 --> 01:33:17,766
Deal!

1283
01:33:19,601 --> 01:33:22,646
[Scotty Narrating] Even though
Bill loved the Murderer's Row ball,

1284
01:33:22,771 --> 01:33:25,398
he was still plenty mad
about me having swiped...

1285
01:33:25,482 --> 01:33:29,235
his Babe Ruth autographed ball
and ruining it.

1286
01:33:29,319 --> 01:33:33,281
So I didn't feel too bad when
he grounded me for a week...

1287
01:33:33,365 --> 01:33:35,659
instead of the rest of my life.

1288
01:33:35,742 --> 01:33:37,911
Wow!

1289
01:33:37,994 --> 01:33:40,288
Things worked out
between me and him.

1290
01:33:40,372 --> 01:33:42,791
And from then on,
I didn't have any trouble...

1291
01:33:42,874 --> 01:33:46,628
just calling him Dad
all the time.

1292
01:33:46,711 --> 01:33:50,590
We all lived together
in the neighborhood
for a couple of more years--

1293
01:33:50,674 --> 01:33:53,802
mostly through junior high school--
and every summer was great.

1294
01:33:53,927 --> 01:33:57,263
But none of them ever came
close to that first one.

1295
01:33:57,347 --> 01:33:59,432
When one guy would move away,

1296
01:33:59,516 --> 01:34:02,602
we never replaced him
on the team with anyone else.

1297
01:34:02,686 --> 01:34:06,106
We just kept the game going
like he was still there.

1298
01:34:06,189 --> 01:34:08,441
You're starting
to hurt my hand.

1299
01:34:08,525 --> 01:34:10,610
[ Boy ]
Don't miss it!

1300
01:34:10,777 --> 01:34:13,113
[ Scotty Narrating ]
It was weird that Benny said...

1301
01:34:13,196 --> 01:34:17,617
Babe Ruth was like the Hercules
of baseball, and The Beast's
name ended up being Hercules.

1302
01:34:17,701 --> 01:34:20,203
None of us could figure out
what that meant,

1303
01:34:20,286 --> 01:34:22,539
but we were all amazed by it.

1304
01:34:22,664 --> 01:34:24,624
I kept in touch with those guys
over the years,

1305
01:34:24,708 --> 01:34:28,295
and I found out that Yeah- Yeah's parents
shipped him off to military school.

1306
01:34:28,378 --> 01:34:32,257
After the army, he became one of the
pioneering developers of bungee jumping.

1307
01:34:32,382 --> 01:34:34,217
Of course, we all know why.

1308
01:34:34,342 --> 01:34:37,512
Bertram, well-- Bertram got
really into the '60s,

1309
01:34:37,595 --> 01:34:39,639
and no one ever saw him again.

1310
01:34:39,723 --> 01:34:43,643
Timmy and Tommy became
an architect and a contractor.

1311
01:34:43,727 --> 01:34:46,062
They started out small,
designing playground equipment...

1312
01:34:46,146 --> 01:34:48,273
and prefabricated tree houses.

1313
01:34:48,398 --> 01:34:50,275
But they became
multimillionaires...

1314
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:54,237
when they invented
mini-malls.

1315
01:34:54,321 --> 01:34:56,823
Squints grew up and married
Wendy Peffercorn.

1316
01:34:56,906 --> 01:34:58,908
They have nine kids.

1317
01:34:59,034 --> 01:35:02,704
They bought Vincent's Drugstore,
and they still own it to this day.

1318
01:35:02,787 --> 01:35:05,540
Hamilton Porter became
a professional wrestler.

1319
01:35:05,623 --> 01:35:07,876
You know him
as The Great Hambino.

1320
01:35:07,959 --> 01:35:12,672
DeNunez played triple-A ball,
but he never got to the majors.

1321
01:35:12,756 --> 01:35:15,550
He owns his own business now,
and he coaches a little league team...

1322
01:35:15,634 --> 01:35:19,220
that his sons play on
called the Heaters.

1323
01:35:19,304 --> 01:35:22,766
Hercules lived
to be 199 years old--

1324
01:35:22,891 --> 01:35:24,768
uh, in doggy years.

1325
01:35:24,893 --> 01:35:27,771
I was the last one
to move away.

1326
01:35:27,896 --> 01:35:31,066
But when I did,
the sandlot was still there.

1327
01:35:31,191 --> 01:35:35,028
After Benny pickled The Beast,
his reputation spread all over town.

1328
01:35:35,111 --> 01:35:38,698
From then on, he was known as
Benny "The Jet" Rodriguez.

1329
01:35:38,782 --> 01:35:42,369
And the nickname stuck with him
for the rest of his life.

1330
01:35:42,452 --> 01:35:45,038
[Announcer] Now pinch running
for the Los Angeles Dodgers,

1331
01:35:45,121 --> 01:35:48,958
Benny "The Jet" Rodriguez!

1332
01:35:50,210 --> 01:35:53,463
It is the clutch situation
of the season.

1333
01:35:53,588 --> 01:35:56,299
They say The Jet's lost
a step or two,

1334
01:35:56,424 --> 01:36:00,136
but I wouldn't be surprised
to see some fireworks here.

1335
01:36:02,430 --> 01:36:06,434
The Jet's got
a suicide lead and--

1336
01:36:06,518 --> 01:36:09,312
And there he goes! He's stealing home!
I don't believe it!

1337
01:36:09,396 --> 01:36:12,315
- He's stealing home!
- [ Cheering ]

1338
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:15,819
He's stealing home,
and they don't see him! The pitch!

1339
01:36:22,993 --> 01:36:25,912
He's hit the dirt!
He's safe! Safe!

1340
01:36:25,996 --> 01:36:29,040
- Oh, my God!
- [ Cheering ]

1341
01:36:31,042 --> 01:36:33,253
Safe! Safe! Safe!

1342
01:36:33,336 --> 01:36:37,674
I don't believe it! The Jet
stole home! The Jet stole home!

1343
01:36:37,757 --> 01:36:39,801
