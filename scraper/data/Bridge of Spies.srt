Every single
legitimate claim,

81
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:41,967
up to the limit
of their liability,

82

had one accident.

Jim, my guys
aren't bowling pins,

95
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,035
as much as your guy
may have treated them as such.

96
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,369

Let me finish.

is insured for $100,000

carries it away,

99
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:23,943
it carried away one house.

100
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,411
It didn't pick up
every stick of furniture

101

and destroy it
in a separate incident.

If that is
what you're saying,

well, then there is never
any limit to our liability

104

and that is the end
of the insurance business.

I wanna pick that up.

131

The accused
doesn't know any lawyers.

132

The federal court
tossed it into our lap.

133

The Bar Committee took a vote.

You're the unanimous choice.

135
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,901
It was important to us...

136
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,236
It's important
to our country, Jim,

137
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,205
that this man is seen
as getting a fair shake.

138
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,240
American justice
will be on trial.

139
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,175
Well, of course,
when you put it that way,

140
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,177
it's an honor to be asked.

141
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,112
But, Lynn,
I'm an insurance lawyer.

142
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,081
I haven't done
criminal work in years.

143
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,116
It's like riding a bike,
isn't it?

144
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,219
You distinguished yourself
at Nuremberg.

145
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,954
I was on
the prosecution team.

146
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,222
Not the point.

147
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,615
You're no stranger
to criminal law.

148
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,292
Jim, look at the situation.

149
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,361
The man is publicly reviled.

150
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,395
And I will be, too.

151
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,264
Yes, in more
ignorant quarters.

152
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,132
But that's exactly why
this has to be done,

153
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,235
and capably done.

154
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,237
It can't look like
our justice system

155
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,430
tosses people
on the ash heap.

156
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,246
Suppose I did,
what's the evidence look like?

157
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,015
Pretty overwhelming.

158
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,517
Great. Great.

159
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,187
Everyone will hate me
but at least I'll lose.

160
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,322
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,424

00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,127
The firm will suffer.
I have work here.

163
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,196
I think
it's a patriotic duty.

164
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,198
It's an important mission.

165
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,433
I told Lynn,
the firm can't say no,

166
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,535
and you'd have a tough time
saying no, too.

167
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:08,007
I think you have to defend
the son of a bitch.

168
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,042
So, you're doing it?

169
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,410
JAMES: Doing what?

170
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,446
Defending Abel,
the Soviet spy.

171
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,781
I may. I have to speak to...

172
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,450
Wait, how do you know?
Did they post it on the bulletin board?

173
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,552
No, I... I was
talking to Richard Earl...

174
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,488
Look, if I do this,
I'm going to need your help.

175

(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

176
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,293
Can you work tonight?

177
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,401
Well, I have
a dinner date, sir.

178
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,302
It's Tuesday, right?
Yeah, no, I'm free, completely free.

179
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:37,436
Thank you, sir.

180
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,309
JAMES: But it's also an honor.

181
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,444
And the Bar Association
asked me

182
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,246
because they want
to show that even a spy

183
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,048
gets a capable advocate.

184
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,216
Well, maybe it's the kind of honor
we could do without.

185
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,650
Hey, honey,
what are you doing home?

186
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,053
I got stood up.

187
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,557
Well, that's despicable.

188
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,159
Who is this knot-head?

189
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,360
I'd rather not say.

190
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,529
MARY: Well, sit down.
We just started.

191
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:04,730
People are scared.

192
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,598
They're building
bomb shelters to protect themselves

193
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,034
from people like this man.

194
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,235
I go to the store,

195
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:13,572
people are buying
canned food and potassium tablets.

196
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:16,408
It's all about this man
and what he represents.

197
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,510
He's a threat to all of us.
A traitor.

198
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,346
ROGER: Who's a traitor?
The Rosenbergs were traitors.

199
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,280
Who were they?

200
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,382
They gave atomic secrets
to the Russians.

201
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,384
They were Americans.
They betrayed their country.

202
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,486
You can't accuse Abel
of being a traitor.

203
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,054
He's not an American.

(SOFTLY)
Oh, listen to yourself.

205

You're defending him already.

You're rehearsing it on me.

207
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,227
You said you were
just thinking about taking it.

208
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,130
I am just thinking about it,
just very hard.

209
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,100
Everyone deserves a defense.
Every person matters.

210
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,434
Jim, what do we deserve?

211
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,403
Do you know how
people will look at us?

212

The family of a man
trying to free a traitor?

213
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,540
He's not a traitor, Mary.
Yes, yes.

214
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,109
(PHONE RINGING)
Roger, get that! He's not a traitor...

215
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,377
Why do I have to do
all the work?

Oh! You wait till we say grace.
I'm hungry!

217

He's about the most unpopular
man in this country,

218
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,248
and you're trying
to take second place!

00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,683
Yeah, and I'm third.

I wanna eat.

Mary, don't make
this an argument

222
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:02,287
when we're not having
an argument.

223
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,589
You're against him,
I'm for him?

224
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:06,425
No, I'm not for him.
I'm not for the Russians spying on us.

225
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,428
I'm for his right to have a defense
in a court of law,

226
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,463
which is why they call it
a court of law.

to interrupt dinner.

Oh, no, not at all.
Hello, Doug. Jim was just flailing.

So, you came over
to help Jim think about

233
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,448
whether he's
taking the case?

234
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:32,351

would be made against me.

Francis Gary Powers.

CIA AGENT: Rank, service?

325
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,706
First Lieutenant,
United States Air Force.

326
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,476
Do you have any association

327
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,511
with the Soviet Union,
Lieutenant Powers?

Kidding?

329
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:28,947
Just answer the questions,
Lieutenant.

330
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,550
Yes, no,
or as simply as you can.

Do you have any association
with the Soviet Union?

Hell, no.

why you're here?

Yes. I mean...

No, it's just "no."

Yes, I have absolutely
no idea why I'm here.

Okay, drivers,
here's the deal.

00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:01,006
You've been selected
for a mission

355

which you are
not to discuss

with anyone

You don't tell
any of them anything

362
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,521
of what
I'm about to tell you.

363
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,760
Each of you drivers has
met certain qualifications.

High level

00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,605
We are engaged in a war.

369
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,874
This war does not, for the moment,
involve men-at-arms.

370
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,776
It involves information.

371
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,011
You will be
collecting information.

372
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,881
You will be gathering
intelligence about the enemy.

373
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:46,551
The intelligence you gather
could give us the upper hand

374

in a full thermonuclear exchange
with the Soviet Union.

You cannot be shot down.
You cannot be captured.

speaking with a phony accent.

Does he keep that up
all the time?

386
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:38,670
Actually, I'm pretty sure
that's just the way he talks.

387
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,805
He's got the Russian name
but a British passport.

Well, I doubt
that that's genuine.

is going to do it, here.

makes us Americans.

makes us Americans

There was a warrant.

A civil detention writ
for the arrest of an alien,

Yeah, Vogel says

1168
01:12:33,949 --> 01:12:35,851
he's gone to the Russian
embassy in East Berlin

out of Yale.

Well, so,
what is he?

1190
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:31,073
Vogel, is he, uh,
East German or is he Russian?

but like I said, there's a wrinkle.

I won't be taking you.
Decision's been made.

1198

01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,695
Yeah, the East Germans
grabbed this kid.

1201
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:57,666
There's a degree of impunity
that we had not anticipated.

1202
01:13:57,699 --> 01:14:00,669
The point is that the East German agenda
and the Russian agenda

1203
01:14:00,702 --> 01:14:02,104
may not be
the same thing.

Mmm-mmm.
Don't fall for that.

1208
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:12,714
We can get him out
another time.

1209

the international lines

1217
01:14:57,793 --> 01:15:00,028
but local calls
are okay.

1218

day and night.

There are only a few routes
left to the East.

1223
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,893
You take the S-Bahn, the station we showed
you on the way in.

1224
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:33,195
You're gonna get off
at the Friedrichstrasse station here

1225
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:36,131
and walk to the Soviet embassy
on Unter den Linden here.

1226
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:38,800
Look at the map now.
You shouldn't take it with you.

1227
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:40,936
You're looking at a map,
you're an American, you're a spy.

1228
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:42,971
You could
well be detained.

1229
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:45,073
Just avoid interacting
with people generally.

1230
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:48,043
You don't...
You don't belong, so don't stick out.

1231
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:50,178
Food is scarce over there
and things have started to fall apart.

1232
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,413
There are gangs,

1233
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:54,716
and rule of law is less firmly
established over there.

1234
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,752
And definitely stay away
from the Wall.

1235
01:15:56,785 --> 01:15:57,953
On their side,
there's a line

1236
01:15:57,986 --> 01:15:59,021
cleared of buildings
along the Wall.

1237
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:00,756
They call it
the "Death Line."

1238
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:02,691
Cross it and
you'll be shot.

1239
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:05,060
Is there any outcome here
where I'm not either detained or shot?

01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:24,279
Mr. Vogel.
He doesn't work here.

1271

I'm just supposed to meet him.
That's all I know.

1272
01:21:49,604 --> 01:21:51,239
Mr. Donovan!

1273
01:21:52,107 --> 01:21:53,441
So we finally meet you.

(EXCLAIMING)

1275

I'm Helen Abel.

01:21:57,279 --> 01:21:58,580
How is our husband?
Oh. He's fine.

1277
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:00,081
How is my Rudolf?

1278
01:22:00,115 --> 01:22:02,050
As good as
can be expected.

1279
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:04,586
And we will
get him back, yes?

1280
01:22:04,619 --> 01:22:07,055
This is our daughter.
How do you do?

1281

Lydia.

1282
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:10,292
Are you Mr. Vogel?

1283
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:12,560
(CHUCKLING)
No, no, no!

1284

I'm not Vogel.

1285
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:15,530
I'm cousin Drews.

1286
01:22:17,465 --> 01:22:19,334
This is Rudolf's
beloved cousin Drews.

1287
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:21,569
Yes, cousin Drews.
I am cousin Drews.

1288
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:23,305
Cousin Drews, yes.

1289
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:24,372
I'm Helen Abel.

1290
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:29,577
When will you see him?

1291
01:22:31,346 --> 01:22:33,348
When will your government
release him?

1292
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:35,350
I'm a little,
uh, lost here.

1293
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:37,252
I'm supposed to meet
a Mr. Vogel.

1294
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:39,387
BOTH: Oh, Mr. Vogel
is our lawyer.

1295
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:43,358
We were supposed to negotiate,
uh, the exchange.

1296
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:46,161
To bring Rudolf here?
Yes, yes, to bring him here.

1297
01:22:46,194 --> 01:22:49,030
But it doesn't happen unilaterally,
do you understand?

1298
01:22:49,064 --> 01:22:50,565
It has to be
an exchange.

Ah, and you were alone?

01:24:20,288 --> 01:24:21,723
Yeah.

about me, sir.

I'm a private citizen.

1337
01:24:28,696 --> 01:24:30,665
I'm a lawyer in Brooklyn
in the United States,

1338
01:24:30,698 --> 01:24:33,334
and I've taken time
out of my busy schedule

1339
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:36,137
to help my client,
Rudolf Abel.

1340
01:24:36,171 --> 01:24:40,208
I'm authorized to arrange
an exchange of Abel

1341
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:42,677
for Francis Gary Powers.

1342
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:45,580
This is a full
pardon of Abel

1343
01:24:45,613 --> 01:24:47,933
that will be signed
when the exchange actually takes place.

This is the only
reason I'm here.

I hope and expect to make
this arrangement quickly.

1346
01:24:54,489 --> 01:24:56,524
Abel for Francis
Gary Powers

1347

and Frederic Pryor.

1348

Mmm, we don't have Pryor.

No? You don't?

1350

I've heard of Pryor,
but he's held

by the German
Democratic Republic,

not by the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.

the first problem.

If we release Powers,

01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:32,594
it is only to
promote a goodwill

So, it cannot be
an exchange.

Perhaps...

1362
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:45,507
Perhaps you could
release Abel

1363
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:47,475
as a token of goodwill
to our friends in Germany,

and then,
some months later,

1365
01:25:50,411 --> 01:25:52,814
we would release Powers.

1366
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:55,283
There is an idea.
No. That just won't work for us at all.

an exchange.

what you want,

it must be.

within 48 hours.

We need Powers
at the same time we give you Abel.

Hmm. This is...

the "impatient plan"?

But they will wonder
why so impatient.

1379

Because I have a cold.

And I don't live in Berlin
and I want to go home.

must have gotten

"all the information
that he has to give."

1388

This is not
an equitable trade, sir.

1389

But what you're saying is,

1390
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:00,582
if Powers has given up
everything he knows,

1391
01:27:00,615 --> 01:27:02,850
then Moscow would trade?

1392
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:04,452
Why wouldn't they?

1393
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:08,656
As for Abel, if he dies
in an American prison,

1394
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:11,359
the next Russian operative
who gets caught

1395
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:13,428
might think twice about
keeping his mouth shut.

1396
01:27:13,461 --> 01:27:18,800
And you never know.
Abel might want to see the sky again

1397
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:21,869
and decide to trade Russian
secrets for small American favors.

1398
01:27:25,707 --> 01:27:27,775
How can we know this?

1399

We little men,
we just do our jobs.

1400
01:27:31,512 --> 01:27:33,848
Like Lieutenant Powers.
He's just a pilot.

1401
01:27:36,684 --> 01:27:40,521
He was making photographs
from 70,000 feet

1402
01:27:40,555 --> 01:27:41,715
when he was shot
from the sky.

1403
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:44,759
People in my country
consider this

1404
01:27:44,792 --> 01:27:46,628
an act of war.

1405
01:27:48,963 --> 01:27:51,733
We have to get off this
merry-go-round, sir.

1406
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:53,534
The next mistake
our countries make

1407
01:27:53,568 --> 01:27:55,336
could be the last one.

1408
01:27:56,537 --> 01:27:58,806
We need to have
the conversation

1409
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:00,541
our governments can't.

1410
01:28:05,847 --> 01:28:08,516
I will ask Moscow.

1411
01:28:08,549 --> 01:28:10,518
Who knows
what they will say.

1412
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:13,788
There are a lot of people,
Mr. Donovan,

1413

who doesn't want this
exchange to ever take place.

1414

Can you come back tomorrow
to discuss their answer?

Powers for Abel.

1416
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:26,934
And Frederic Pryor.

1417
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:28,469
As I said,

1418
01:28:28,503 --> 01:28:30,672
Pryor is in the hands
of the organs of

1419
01:28:30,705 --> 01:28:32,907
State Security of the German
Democratic Republic.

1420
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:35,510
I'm confident you can
make arrangements.

1421
01:28:35,543 --> 01:28:37,845
I am merely a secretary

of foreign power.

1423

Okay, okay.

1424
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:44,585
You have to see Mr. Vogel.
I'll give you his address.

There actually is

We will produce

Absolutely.

for the Russians,

winning their respect...

And capturing the headlines
for their cause.

1513
01:32:52,733 --> 01:32:54,969
Which, of course,
puts East Germany on the map.

But we don't care
about their map.

Stick with
the Russians.

1516

Stick with the Russians.
It's Powers for Abel.

1517
01:33:01,876 --> 01:33:05,012
So, does all this mean
this might actually happen?

1518
01:33:05,046 --> 01:33:06,914
Yeah, that's what
you seem to be telling me.

1519

We'll put Abel on a plane,
he'll be here Friday.

1520

So, if Schischkin
gets the okay,

1521
01:33:12,053 --> 01:33:14,221
all that's left is the
mechanics of the trade.

for their guy.

No, now don't go
bleeding heart on me.

Powers is the whole
ball game.

1742
01:45:59,219 --> 01:46:01,655
(CLEARS THROAT) Yeah,
I'll start with some coffee, please.

1743
01:46:01,688 --> 01:46:03,857
Then I'll have
the Hilton combo

1744

and the American
breakfast.

1745
01:46:05,759 --> 01:46:06,860
And coffee.

1746
01:46:06,893 --> 01:46:07,961

1747

Yeah, yeah.

Both first, both.
Whenever they're ready.

1750
01:46:12,532 --> 01:46:14,501
And coffee.
Hmm.

1751
01:46:32,085 --> 01:46:33,854
You shouldn't be here.

1752
01:46:33,887 --> 01:46:35,055
Well, sometimes
in Germany,

1753
01:46:35,088 --> 01:46:36,957
you just want a big
American breakfast.

1754
01:46:41,027 --> 01:46:43,063
What happened?
Where were you last night?

1755
01:46:43,096 --> 01:46:46,066
Vogel arranged for me
to spend some time in the East.

1756
01:46:46,099 --> 01:46:47,667
Oh, Jesus.

1757
01:46:47,701 --> 01:46:48,935
Frankly, it's not
that much worse

1758
01:46:48,969 --> 01:46:50,804
than where you have me
here in the West.

1759
01:46:52,873 --> 01:46:56,543
So the Russians are fine
with the exchange,

1760
01:46:56,576 --> 01:46:59,079
but now Vogel is saying
that the East Germans won't do it.

1761
01:46:59,112 --> 01:47:00,112
We're not gonna
get Pryor.

1762
01:47:01,515 --> 01:47:03,517
Great, good.

1763
01:47:03,550 --> 01:47:05,552
So the Soviets are set.
We get Powers.

1764
01:47:05,585 --> 01:47:06,853
We get Powers.

1765
01:47:06,887 --> 01:47:08,889
Well done.

1766
01:47:08,922 --> 01:47:10,957
JAMES: No, the East Germans
won't do it.

1767
01:47:10,991 --> 01:47:13,093
We won't get Pryor,
and that kid matters.

Every person matters.

1769

Sure, that's why you tried.
That's why you tried.

1770
01:47:17,931 --> 01:47:19,966
Abel's on his way,
so we're all set for tomorrow morning.

Wait a minute.

We are not
getting the kid.

01:47:24,905 --> 01:47:27,040
Yeah, I understand.
We're set.

1774

We can ignore the message
we got this morning.

1775
01:47:30,677 --> 01:47:31,912
What message?

1776
01:47:31,945 --> 01:47:33,079
From the East Germans.

1777
01:47:33,113 --> 01:47:35,048
They called the number
I gave you.

1778
01:47:35,081 --> 01:47:37,584
They said they wanted
to speak to you today.

What does he want?

1783
01:47:45,091 --> 01:47:46,193
Well, to talk to you.

1784
01:47:46,226 --> 01:47:49,129
But it's okay,
I can't ask you to go back there.

1785
01:47:49,162 --> 01:47:51,765
And listen, you seem to be
persona non grata to some elements,

1786
01:47:51,798 --> 01:47:53,099
so we won't
push our luck.

1787
01:47:53,133 --> 01:47:55,135

I thank you, sir.

became so confused.

they just do.

For sake of clarity,

1804
01:48:43,850 --> 01:48:46,186
I say we are fully
prepared to exchange

1805
01:48:46,219 --> 01:48:50,924
the so-called student, Pryor,
for Rudolf Abel.

1806
01:48:50,957 --> 01:48:53,793
I understand from Mr. Vogel
that Pryor is very important to you.

1807
01:48:53,827 --> 01:48:55,195
JAMES: Yes, but...

1808
01:48:55,228 --> 01:48:57,797
Ah, we'll do a memorandum
to that effect.

1809
01:48:59,165 --> 01:49:01,101
Oh, a memorandum.

1810
01:49:01,134 --> 01:49:04,604
Certainly, we commit
to a bi-lateral exchange.

1811

Yes, yes, sure. I'm not sure
what that means but...

on Francis Gary Powers.

is he, sir?

what he will divulge,

as no doubt
Abel has also.

someone who you insist is innocent.

the Soviets.

don't even want him,
