Marie Kreutz, his girlfriend.

00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:39,266
She was killed in India.

38
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,468
Director of Operations
Ward Abbott arranged it.

39
00:04:45,913 --> 00:04:49,576
So we have a dirty section
chief who kills Bourne's girl.

40
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:52,882
Bourne comes back for revenge,
tapes Abbott's confession

41
00:04:52,954 --> 00:04:55,047
and Abbott commits suicide.

42
00:04:55,123 --> 00:04:57,284
Now Bourne's gunning for us.

six weeks ago.

Right.
Sir.

46
00:05:06,668 --> 00:05:08,363
He's on the run.
He's dangerous.

Well, sir, with respect,
I think something else
could be going on here.

48
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:14,071
What? What's he after?

49
00:05:14,142 --> 00:05:17,600
The reason Bourne went
to Moscow was to see the
daughter of his first target.

50
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:19,010
What's your point, Pam?

51
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,605
Maybe he was
retracing his steps.

52
00:05:21,683 --> 00:05:24,447
He's looking for something.
Something in his past.

53
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:27,682
Maybe he hasn't found
it yet and we need
to know what it is.

54
00:05:27,755 --> 00:05:30,588
Are you telling me he's not
a threat to this agency?

55
00:05:30,658 --> 00:05:33,593
I think if he wanted
to hurt us, he could
have sent the tape to CNN.

56
00:05:33,661 --> 00:05:35,458
Maybe he still will.

57
00:05:36,964 --> 00:05:41,298
My number one rule is hope for
the best, plan for the worst.

58
00:05:42,837 --> 00:05:47,934

Bourne is still a serious
threat until proven otherwise.
