1
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,311
Snuggle in, sweetie.
It's cold out there.

2
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,191
Why is it snowing, Grandma?

3
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,569
Where does it come from?

4
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,530
Oh, that's a long story, sweetheart.

5
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:22,367
- I wanna hear.
- Oh, not tonight. Go to sleep.

6
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,871
I'm not sleepy. Tell me, please?

7
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:29,374
Well, all right.

8
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,085
Let's see.

9
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,964
I guess it would have to
start with scissors.

10
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,258
Scissors?

11
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:42,554
Well, there are
all kinds of scissors.

12
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:47,434
And once there was even a man
who had scissors for hands.

13
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,853
- A man?
- Yes.

14
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,147
Hands-scissors?

15
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:54,858
No. Scissorhands.

16
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:59,404
You know the mansion
on top of the mountain?

17
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,698
It's haunted.

18
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,368
Well...

19
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,663
a long time ago...

20
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,959
an inventor lived in that mansion.

21
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:15,796
<i>He made many things, I suppose.</i>

22
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,596
<i>He also created a man.</i>

23
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,641
<i>He gave him insides...</i>

24
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:31,770
<i>a heart, a brain, everything.</i>

25
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,606
<i>Well, almost everything.</i>

26
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:40,445
<i>You see, the inventor was very old.</i>

27
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:45,242
<i>He died before he got to finish
the man he invented...</i>

28
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,870
<i>so the man was left by himself...</i>

29
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:53,834
<i>incomplete and all alone.</i>

30
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,712
<i>He didn't have a name?</i>

31
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,631
<i>Of course he had a name.</i>

32
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,175
<i>His name was Edward.</i>

33
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:51,600
- Avon calling!
- Weren't you just here?

34
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,977
No! Not since last season.

35
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,898
Today I've come to show you
our exquisite new line of softer colors...

36
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,817
in shadows, blushes and lipstick.

37
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:04,780
Everything you need to accent
and highlight your changing look.

38
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,908
My changing look. That's good.

39
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:12,370
Well, it goes without saying that I also have
a complete selection of your old favorites...

40
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:16,291
those tried-and-true products we've all
come to depend on year-in and year-out.

41
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,960
Come on, Peg. I never
buy anything from you. You know that.

42
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,755
- I know. Bye, Helen.
- Bye.

43
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,426
<i>You didn't have to call, ma'am.
You could have taken care of this by yourself.</i>

44
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,845
<i>I</i> could? I don't think so.

45
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,224
Yeah, it's easy.
Your food trap's clogged. That's all.

46
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,727
- You see this bulb here? You just unscrew this.
- Mm-hmm.

47
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,021
And out she pops.

48
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:41,691
On TV they say you repairmen are lonely.
Housewives get lonely too.

49
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:45,862
Although you may not realize it, since they
haven't made a commercial on the subject.

50
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:49,282
Then you just take this
and put it back in here nice and easy.

51
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,410
Be careful not to force it,
because it fits in there by itself.

52
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,539
And then you just screw this back on.

53
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:59,251
Oh, now, who could that be?
Will you excuse me for a moment?

54
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,587
Now, don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

55
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:07,342
This is fascinatin'. I wouldn't
want to miss a moment of it.

56
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,223
Good morning, Joyce. Avon calling.

57
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,725
Why, Peg, have you gone blind?

58
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,938
Can't you see there's a vehicle
in my driveway?

59
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:24,109
- Oh. Yes.
- I'm surprised you don't realize that means I'm busy.

60
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,446
<i>Now, we should decide on lipsticks.</i>

61
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,740
Okay, dear,
what one did you like best?

62
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:35,704
There was the Winsome Wahini, which looked
charming on you, or the Bahimini Bliss.

63
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,832
- I like 'em both.
- Well, great!

64
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,711
You don't actually think
I have any money, do you?

65
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,940
It's just not my day.

66
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:03,184
Oh, my goodness.

67
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,873
Oh, it's so beautiful.

68
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,020
Hello?

69
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,091
Hello?

70
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,893
Hello! Avon calling!

71
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,305
Oh, my.

72
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,767
Hello?

73
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,646
Hello?

74
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,066
Hello. I'm Peg Boggs.

75
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,570
I'm your local
Avon representative. Hello?

76
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,875
I-I'm sorry to barge in like this...

77
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:35,003
but you don't have
any reason to be afraid.

78
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,006
Oh! This is some
huge house, isn't it?

79
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,801
Thank goodness for
those aerobics... classes.

80
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:40,068
Hello? Hello!

81
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,612
Why are you hiding back there?

82
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,576
<i>You don't have to hide from me.</i>

83
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,412
<i>I'm Peg Boggs.
I'm your local Avon representative.</i>

84
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,958
<i>And I'm as harmless as cherryp...</i>

85
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:59,045
Oh, my. I can see
that I've disturbed you.

86
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,381
How stupid of me.
I-I'll just be going now.

87
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,758
Don't go.

88
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,641
Oh, my.

89
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,936
What happened to you?

90
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,272
- I'm not finished.
- Oh!

91
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:21,067
Put those down.
Don't come any closer. Just, please...

92
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:30,368
Those are your hands?

93
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,912
Those are your hands.

94
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,335
What happened to you?

95
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,506
Where are your parents?

96
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:47,176
Um, your mother?

97
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,929
Your father?

98
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,223
He didn't wake up.

99
00:14:56,604 --> 00:15:00,732
Are you alone?
Do you live up here all by yourself?

100
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,489
What happened to your face? Hmm.

101
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,119
<i>No, I won't hurt you.</i>

102
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,622
But at the very least...

103
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,333
let me give you a good astringent.

104
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,960
This will help to prevent infection.

105
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,098
What's your name?

106
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,434
Edward.

107
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,811
Edward?

108
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:45,360
I think you should
just come home with me.

109
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:03,544
- I'm... I'm sorry.
- No, no, don't be. You go ahead and look.

110
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,339
You have every reason to be excited.

111
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,887
Ohh! You okay?

112
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:15,807
You okay?

113
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,876
<i>On Who's Counting?</i>

114
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,713
- <i>And here's the host</i> of Who's Counting...
- Hello.

115
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,132
Hi. Yeah, it's Marge.

116
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:53,428
I was standing outside talking to Carol,
and Peg drove by, and she had somebody in the car.

117
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,639
- Did you get a good look at him?
- No, I didn't.

118
00:16:56,724 --> 00:17:00,393
- Did she say anything to you about having a guest?
- She didn't say anything to me.

119
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:03,896
- She rang my doorbell at the crack of dawn this morning.
- No.

120
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:07,442
Okay, I'll meet you
on the corner. Right. Bye.

121
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,364
Oh, damn!

122
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,296
Here we go, dear. This is our house.

123
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,966
<i>You can just go right in
and make yourself at home. Okay?</i>

124
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,720
We'll have something
to eat or drink or whatever you...

125
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:40,391
Here, dear. This is the front door here.
Here we go. Right in here.

126
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,478
Joyce, I just saw this strange guy
driving with Peg.

127
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,898
I didn't get a very good look at him.
He looked kinda pale.

128
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,066
Don't do anything without me.
Okay, bye.

129
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,861
Yes! Be right there!

130
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,368
Here we are.

131
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,056
So, um, this is the living room.

132
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,391
Back here are the bedrooms.

133
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,853
You want to see the pictures.
All right.

134
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,564
Well, this is my husband, Bill.

135
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:32,985
He's a bowling champion.
Do you know what bowling is?

136
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,238
Bowling?

137
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,907
Well, here they are
down at the lake, fishing.

138
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:43,830
<i>I think Kevin looks a little glum
because they didn't catch anything that day.</i>

139
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:48,125
And, um, here's my daughter, Kim...

140
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,087
all dressed for the junior prom.

141
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,390
<i>She's a senior now,
if you can believe it.</i>

142
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,768
<i>She's camping in the mountains with some
friends, but she'll be back in a few days.</i>

143
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,937
<i>You can meet her then.</i>

144
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,782
<i>Isn't she beautiful?</i>

145
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,876
That's my family.

146
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,004
Come along, dear, and I'll show you
the rest of the house.

147
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:36,132
Then you can just freshen up
and make yourself at home.

148
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:40,303
That's the kitchen over there. You help yourself
to anything you want to eat or drink.

149
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:43,431
Those are grapes.
And back here are the bedrooms.

150
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:47,476
Let me get you some towels,
and I'll see what we can find for you to wear.

151
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:51,188
You know what? I think I have
some of Bill's old clothes in here.

152
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,691
<i>This is perfect.</i>

153
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,943
Here. These should just fit you.

154
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,697
Oh! Don't be alarmed.
That's just the phone.

155
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:03,910
You can go in Kim's room
and put these on. I'll be right with you.

156
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,394
No, no, he has scissors.
No, scissors. That's right.

157
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,522
Well, he... he was
born up there or something.

158
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,150
Have you ever seen him before?

159
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:02,278
No, I don't think
he's been off the grounds before today.

160
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,363
How did you ever
get together with him?

161
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:08,117
Listen, I have to go now.
I'll talk to you later, Marge. Bye-bye.

162
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,171
Sorry, Edward, I...

163
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:23,299
Oh, dear. May I help you with this?

164
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,676
Thank you.

165
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,139
There you go.

166
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:33,225
Oh, dear, you've cut your face.
Let me just get this off.

167
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,311
- Does that hurt?
- No.

168
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:39,065
No? Good. Okay.
Now let's get you dressed.

169
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,776
Okay.

170
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,196
There we go. Very fine.

171
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:52,328
You look fine. Just fine.

172
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,705
Oh.

173
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,794
Come on! We can't wait for you!

174
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,755
- You've got rollers in your damn hair.
- Damn!

175
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,983
Okay.

176
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:26,487
Now, what did I do with my sci...

177
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,615
Edward, um, would you?

178
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,910
<i>Thank you.</i>

179
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:37,081
You know, I have a doctor friend
who I think could help you.

180
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:40,209
- Really?
- Yes.

181
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:43,671
Now, I can help with the scars.

182
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:50,803
But I just wanna consult
the big Avon handbook before doing anything.

183
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,535
Bye!

184
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,141
Kevin.

185
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:43,814
Kevin, it's not polite
to stare, dear.

186
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:50,321
<i>Kevin, think how it would make you feel
if somebody were staring at you.</i>

187
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:54,533
- <i>I wouldn't care.</i>
- <i>Well, I</i> would! <i>So don't do it!</i>

188
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:58,287
Well, this must be
quite a change for you. Right, Ed?

189
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:02,041
- Edward, dear. I think he prefers Edward.
- Ah. Sure.

190
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:05,544
So, what have you been doing with yourself
up there in that big old place?

191
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:09,632
I bet, uh... I bet the view
must be spectacular. Huh, Ed?

192
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,593
- Edward.
- Yes?

193
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:16,305
Mmm. No, I-I was just...

194
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:21,101
- See all the way to the ocean, I bet, huh?
- Sometimes.

195
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,648
Bill, could I have
the salt and pepper, please?

196
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,445
Bill, could I have
the salt and pepper, please? Thank you.

197
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:33,822
Kevin.

198
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:47,836
Kevin.

199
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:54,176
Man, those things are cool.
I bet they're razor-sharp.

200
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:57,972
- One karate chop to a guy's neck...
- Kevin.

201
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:05,896
<i>Edward, would you like
some butter for your bread?</i>

202
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,569
Great!

203
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,947
Thank you.

204
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:20,202
Hey, can I bring him
to show-and-tell on Monday?

205
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,288
Kevin, I've had enough.

206
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,378
You think you can sleep?

207
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:33,924
I know things feel a little strange now,
but soon you'll feel right at home.

208
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,260
- Good night.
- Good night.

209
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,157
The light concealing cream
goes on first.

210
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:44,703
Then you blend and blend and blend.
Blending is the secret.

211
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,039
Mm-hmm.

212
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:49,333
More concealing cream.

213
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:52,044
Your complexion is so fair.

214
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:55,506
Now, this has a touch
of lavender in it.

215
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:59,843
Give it a try here. Close enough.

216
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,388
Okay, this should do the trick here.

217
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:08,519
Hmm.

218
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:11,146
I have another idea.

219
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:16,193
We'll cover up the scars and start with
a completely smooth surface.

220
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:32,501
Darn this stuff!

221
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:36,004
Hartley into the windup.
And the strike-one pitch.

222
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,257
Swung on and missed. Strike two.

223
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:41,385
<i>Missed a hit. The club has 12 hits.</i>

224
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:46,098
<i>But they still have 11
on the scoreboard, and it's 3-1.</i>

225
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:49,643
<i>0 and 2, the count to Warren.</i>

226
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,899
Now they change it to 12 hits.

227
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,861
Turn it up, Kevin. I can't hear it.

228
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:02,531
Kevin?

229
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:05,909
<i>Hartley's strike-two pitch... is hammered!</i>

230
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,579
- Did you hear that, Mr. Boggs?
- No! Make it louder!

231
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:13,125
It's gone!
It's out of here! It's history!

232
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:20,799
- Dad. Look!
- A grand slam for Martinez...

233
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:24,386
<i>to make it a five-run inning
and blow this game to pieces.</i>

234
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:28,140
I'll be darned.

235
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:44,239
They filled the whole tape.

236
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,367
What's going on over there?
Call me.

237
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,496
Hi, it's Marge. Who is he? Call me.

238
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,249
Oh, by the way, I hear it's pouring rain
in the mountains. You think the kids are okay?

239
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,543
Hey there, darlin'!

240
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:00,172
The gals are all in a tizzy
about your secret visitor.

241
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,758
You can't keep him a secret forever.

242
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:16,188
<i>Peyton, with a career-high average of 213...</i>

243
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,482
Well, it's just wonderful, Ed.

244
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:21,902
My God, you have the whole family
in there, don't ya?

245
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,826
Edward, come here.

246
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,371
How about a strike?

247
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:35,499
Here it is.

248
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:39,962
No, no, no!
That's a terrible idea, son!

249
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:43,674
Go and get the oil can.
We don't want him rusting up on us, do we?

250
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:53,559
Oh, Edward! You did us?

251
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,603
- Oh, Bill, it's us!
- Yes, it is.

252
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,231
Oh, Edward!

253
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,441
It's not heaven he's from.

254
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,570
It's straight from
the stinking flames of hell.

255
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:07,698
The power of Satan is in him.
I can feel it. Can't you?

256
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:10,826
- Have you poor sheep strayed so far from the path?
- We're not sheep.

257
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,203
Don't come near me.

258
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:19,459
That's right, go on.
Get out of here. Run.

259
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,962
Edward, don't you listen to her.

260
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:27,259
Don't worry about her, Edward.
She's just an old loony, that's all.

261
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:36,893
- <i>Hi!</i>
- You all are hidin' in there like a bunch of hermit crabs.

262
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:41,982
- Hi, Joyce. Hi!
- Shame on you, keeping your unusual guest all to yourself.

263
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,359
We think that's
mighty selfish of you.

264
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:49,281
- Things have been hectic.
- That is so sweet of you to want to correct the situation.

265
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:52,784
- What time does the barbecue begin?
- Barbecue?

266
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:56,580
You intend to show your guest hospitality
by introducing him to your friends, don't you?

267
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:59,249
- I'll bring coleslaw.
- I'll bring dessert!

268
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:02,252
And <i>I</i> will bring the ambrosia salad.

269
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:06,423
- What time was it that you said?
- What time? Uh, Bill...

270
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,717
About 5:00?

271
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:12,220
- Bill!
- He has been sent first to tempt you.

272
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,973
But it's not too late.

273
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:20,854
You must push him from you, expel him,
trample down the perversion of nature.

274
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:24,441
Oh, did you hear that?
He's a perversion of nature.

275
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,818
Why, isn't that excitin'?

276
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,450
- See ya later.
- Bye!

277
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,873
Bill! Bill?

278
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:45,212
<i>I've always said you can't have a picnic
or a barbecue without deviled eggs.</i>

279
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:48,548
They're just the best.
They make a thing.

280
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,510
Oh, dear! Edward! That's wonderful!

281
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:55,347
I didn't know you chopped the whole thing,
but we'll have a really big...

282
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,933
Oh. All right, now. Just a nick.

283
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:00,477
There's no need to be nervous, dear.

284
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,979
Esmeralda won't be here...

285
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:06,233
and the rest of the neighbors,
they're really very nice.

286
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:11,446
There's no need to be nervous. They're so eager
to meet you. You just have to be yourself.

287
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:15,367
- Myself?
- That's right. Just your own sweet self.

288
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,057
Thanks, Edward.

289
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:47,435
- Play "Scissors, Paper, Stones" with us.
- Play Scissors-what?

290
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,564
I got a doctor friend of mine
might be able to help you.

291
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,400
- It looks incredible.
- And he did it just like that!

292
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,569
That's really incredible!

293
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,863
Hi, Mike! How you do...

294
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:00,574
Hello, Jack. Hey, kids!

295
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:04,661
Hey! Hi! George Monroe... Whoa!
That's a heck of a handshake you got there, Ed.

296
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:08,790
Harry! Harry!
I saw you on the golf course last week!

297
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:12,544
I love 'em. We got a dozen of the melon
and a dozen of the pineapple.

298
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:15,797
Are you okay? Do you want something to eat?
Are you hungry? Yeah?

299
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,925
- <i>You want a cracker?</i>
- He's so different.

300
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,887
- Completely different.
- No kidding.

301
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:25,515
- He's so...
- Mysterious.
- Yeah.

302
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,394
Do you imagine those hands are hot or cold?

303
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,522
And just think
what a single snip could do.

304
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,275
Or undo.

305
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,694
- Eddie. Eddie.
- Oh!

306
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:41,865
The guys and I were talkin'. We'd like
to invite you to our card game Friday night.

307
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:45,201
Would you like that?
Only thing is, you can't cut!

308
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,425
I have my own infirmity.

309
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,719
Never did me a bit of harm.

310
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,221
Took some shrapnel during the war...

311
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:08,808
and ever since then I can't feel a thing...
not a damn thing!

312
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:12,312
Don't you ever let anybody tell you
you have a handicap.

313
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:16,066
Who's handicapped? My goodness!

314
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:19,736
Don't be ridiculous.
You're not handicapped. You're...

315
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,113
What do they call that?

316
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,449
Exceptional.

317
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:27,953
My name's Joyce, and I noticed that
you have not tasted...

318
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:32,207
any of the ambrosia salad
that I made especially for you.

319
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,584
Allow me.

320
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,009
Mmm! Mmm!

321
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,680
You must try this.
It's my mother's recipe.

322
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,182
Let him chew, for heaven's sake!

323
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:53,520
I've never seen a green thumb like yours.
I sure could use your help at my place.

324
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,147
I want a row of angels.

325
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:59,901
I am so sorry, ladies, but he's promised
to come to my house first.

326
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,195
- Haven't you, Eddie?
- Mm-hmm.

327
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:05,991
Okay, everybody,
grab your plates! Soup's on!

328
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:09,119
- I thought this was shish kebab.
- What?

329
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:12,247
- I thought this was shish kebab.
- Yeah, it is.

330
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:15,834
It was a figure of speech.
You gotta learn not to take things so literally.

331
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:25,385
<i>"Let us pretend that we are in
the drawing room and the hostess is serving tea.</i>

332
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:29,556
<i>"Now many, numerous
little questions confront us.</i>

333
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:36,604
<i>"Should the man rise
when he accepts his cup of tea?</i>

334
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:40,775
<i>May lump sugar be taken with the fingers?"
Mmm, no.</i>

335
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:44,529
<i>"Is it good form
to accept a second cup?</i>

336
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:48,616
<i>"Now, should the napkin
be entirely unfolded...</i>

337
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:52,037
"or should the center crease
be allowed to remain?

338
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,706
"It is so easy to commit
embarrassing blunders...

339
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:58,334
"but etiquette tells us
just what is expected of us...

340
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,504
and guards us from all
humiliation and discomfort."

341
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,765
Mmm, yes. Boring.

342
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,517
Let us switch to, um...

343
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:17,520
to some poetry, hmm?

344
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:24,152
"There was an old man
from the cape...

345
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:27,405
<i>"who made himself garments of crepe.</i>

346
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,909
<i>"When asked, 'Will they tear?',
he replied, 'Here and there!</i>

347
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:35,246
But they keep such a beautiful shape!"

348
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:39,959
<i>That's right. Go ahead.
Smile. It's funny.</i>

349
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,171
<i>That's right.</i>

350
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,778
Okay, you guys, we're home.

351
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:09,405
- Shh!
- I can't believe everything's still sopping.

352
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,534
I can hardly wait to take a shower
and wash off the mildew.

353
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:15,662
- Or to sleep in a bed.
- If my parents have the alarm set, I'm screwed.

354
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:19,165
- I'll have to sleep in the yard again.
- I told you to call them.

355
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,293
- That's right. But did you?
- Nope. He'd rather complain.

356
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:26,256
How else am I supposed to be the center
of attention, huh? You didn't call your parents.

357
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,801
They don't run their house
like a police state. Bye, you guys.

358
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:32,095
- Okay. See you later.
- Bye.

359
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:34,389
- Bye.
- Bye. Don't forget your arm.

360
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,975
- Oh, yeah.
- Come on, Jim, let's go.

361
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:39,537
There's somebody in my room!
Go look!

362
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,123
He's a murderer! He has an ax!

363
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:45,251
- When did you get home?
- He tried to kill me! Go look!

364
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:48,129
It's all right. It's all right.
Go back to bed.

365
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,840
There he is! Oh, my God!

366
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,092
- That's our Edward!
- <i>Who is he?</i>

367
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,221
- <i>That's Edward...</i>
- <i>Edward? What are you talking about?</i>

368
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:59,224
<i>Edward's come to live with us.
There is nothing to be upset about.</i>

369
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,893
- <i>Mom, he had an ax!</i>
- <i>No, no. It's okay.</i>

370
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:05,021
Okay, we'll have you
set up here in a minute.

371
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:08,691
We got a full queen-size bed here.

372
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:13,071
It's all made and everything.
Good. There you go.

373
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:15,990
What's the matter? What's wrong?

374
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:19,118
She get you nervous?

375
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,914
You've been cloistered away
up in that castle too long.

376
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:26,292
You don't know anything about
the wonderful world of teenage girls.

377
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,836
They're all crazy.

378
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:32,465
- Here. This will straighten you right out.
- What is it?

379
00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:34,759
Lemonade.

380
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,558
<i>I don't know what it is.</i>

381
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:45,561
They reach a certain age...

382
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:50,149
they develop these gland things,
their bodies swell up.

383
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,443
They go crazy.

384
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,906
Glands?

385
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:00,368
Yeah, glands.

386
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:03,496
I try not to think about it.

387
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:22,056
Good, isn't it?

388
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:26,352
Now, you stay
in Kevin's room tonight.

389
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,855
Tomorrow, we'll fix your room
right up.

390
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:32,608
- Why did you bring him here?
- I couldn't have left him up there all alone.

391
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:36,154
- You would've done the same thing.
- Why does he have to stay here?

392
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:39,907
Oh, my goodness, Kim. I'm surprised at you.
He can't help the way he is.

393
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:43,036
- Have a little sympathy.
- I <i>do</i> have sympathy.

394
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,706
Then let's say hello to him.
Just come downstairs, shake the man's hand...

395
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,834
- Shake his hand?
- Well, not literally.

396
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:54,255
- Goodness, you scared him half to death.
- <i>I</i> scared <i>him</i> to death?

397
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:00,470
Hi, Bill.

398
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:04,807
I just wanted you two
to have a proper introduction.

399
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,310
Edward, this is our daughter, Kim.

400
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:10,563
Kim, this is Edward,
who's gonna live with us.

401
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,820
Hi.

402
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:35,088
Eddie! Thirsty?

403
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,677
Kisses! Hush up!

404
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:45,306
Shh! Quiet now!

405
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:48,434
Darlin', I can hardly
hear myself think!

406
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,104
Ah, mama's precious
little baby girl.

407
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:58,361
Wouldn't you like a nice,
cool glass of lemonade?

408
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,571
Lemonade?

409
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:14,293
One chop to a guy's neck,
and it's all over.

410
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,838
<i>They're the sharpest things in the world.</i>

411
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:20,758
They can hack
through anything, and...

412
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:42,447
I think they look weird.
They give me the creeps.

413
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:45,783
- You should see the clown in front of Miss Peters's yard.
- Kim!

414
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:48,911
- Oh, no.
- That's him?

415
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,372
- He's callin' you, Kimba.
- Stop it.

416
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:54,584
<i>Edward, you forgot your cookies.</i>

417
00:45:56,753 --> 00:46:00,339
Don't worry, Eddie.
She's waiting for you.

418
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:12,351
<i>Bill, Edward was telling me
he had lunch at Jackie's today.</i>

419
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:15,480
- <i>She just had her kitchen completely redone.</i>
- <i>I'll be darned!</i>

420
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:19,025
<i>New paint, new cabinets, new floors,
a new microwave, new silent dishwasher...</i>

421
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,486
- Isn't that wonderful!
- Isn't that something?

422
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:25,281
Jim, didn't you tell me your mom
had her kitchen done too?

423
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:28,409
- Yeah. My dad bought himself a bunch of new toys.
- Really?

424
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,828
Big-screen TV,
CD players, VCR with four heads.

425
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:33,206
My goodness sake!

426
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,417
- I wonder what it's like to be that rich.
- They keep things locked up.

427
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:40,546
My father has his own room for his stuff
to make sure I can't get any use of it.

428
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,674
He's so cheap, he won't even help me
buy an old car.

429
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,135
He probably wants you
to pay for it yourself. I agree with him.

430
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,596
Builds character.
You'll appreciate it more.

431
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,890
Dad.

432
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:54,602
Speaking of money, I understand you're
not charging for your gardening, Edward.

433
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:58,105
Now, Bill,
Marge made him cookies today.

434
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,816
Sweetheart...

435
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:04,987
you can't buy
the necessities of life with cookies.

436
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:08,324
You can't buy a car with cookies.
Am I right, Jim?

437
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,493
That's true, sir. You can't.

438
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:15,373
I-I can't eat that.
He used his hands.

439
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:17,959
I don't think it's sanitary.

440
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:24,674
I'm sorry.

441
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:31,138
<i>Honey, you want me to
help you clean that up?</i>

442
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:35,560
No, that's okay. I'll be right back.

443
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:27,653
Alexis? Oh, this can't
possibly be my Alexis!

444
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,990
She looks so beautiful! Look at you!

445
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,242
Sweetie!

446
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,745
Thank you.

447
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:39,790
It won't be long.
She just has to decide on the style.

448
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,335
And then it'll be fine.

449
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:53,262
She just has to decide
what style she wants.

450
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:57,725
I was hoping for somethin' big and kinda
bouffant, you know. Kinda like mine.

451
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:02,813
Don't you worry, Kisses. You're gonna be
just fine. You're gonna be so pretty.

452
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:06,275
Yes, you are. Oh! Oh, my.

453
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,070
Ohh!

454
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:24,251
Oh, Eddie,
is there anything you can't do?

455
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,545
You've taken my very breath away.

456
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,382
I swear! Look at this!

457
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:33,344
Have you ever cut a woman's hair?
Would you cut mine?

458
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:46,584
That was the single
most thrillin' experience of my whole life.

459
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:52,942
They're getting
the head of the company!

460
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:56,070
- <i>I'm home!</i>
- Hi, honey! We're in here!

461
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:58,364
- Hi...
- Hi!

462
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:02,159
- What did you do to your hair?
- Edward cut it. Isn't it wild?

463
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:06,789
- Is this Peg Boggs?
- <i>Hello? Oh, I can't believe I'm talking to you in person.</i>

464
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:10,501
- <i>This is such an honor.</i>
- <i>Well, thank you.</i>

465
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:12,711
Yes. Yes, he's right here.

466
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:16,423
Great. So then you know all about him?
Uh-huh.

467
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:20,261
Well, that's exactly
what I've been using.

468
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:23,806
Well, I've had a little trouble getting it
the right consistency.

469
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,225
- Well, just a little.
- Add 21 Red.

470
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:30,855
- I'll try that. Uh-huh.
- And then a dash of 418.

471
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:33,858
Well, what imaginative suggestions.

472
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:37,653
I sure will. Thank you so much.

473
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:39,947
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

474
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:43,075
No wonder she's
the head of the company.

475
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:46,287
She started out
as a sales representative just like me.

476
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:52,501
I've always wanted to talk to her, but until
now I never had a reason. Thanks, Edward.

477
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:56,422
- She had some ideas?
- You bet she did.

478
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,383
- Uh-huh.
- Mm-hmm.

479
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,644
I'll get that.

480
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:54,772
Edward. We're here.

481
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:57,566
Come on. Let's get you sharpened up.

482
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:05,574
- You got it?
- No. I can't believe this. This is such a drag.

483
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:08,243
Hi!

484
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:14,249
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

485
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:18,087
- Do you have a key?
- No.

486
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:22,341
- I could've sworn I put it here somewhere.
- Well, we're stranded.

487
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:29,765
Wow! Thanks!

488
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,059
Ed! What a guy. Good job.

489
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:35,437
You didn't break it
or scratch it or anything.

490
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:38,565
Be a pal and yell when Peg pulls in.

491
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:41,652
Quite a story, yes?

492
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:44,196
Any questions for Edward?

493
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,407
Yeah. Get way over.

494
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:51,161
- Stand right up.
- What's been the best part of your new life here in town?

495
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:53,497
The friends I've made.

496
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:57,418
Any other questions?

497
00:54:57,502 --> 00:55:02,256
Have you ever thought of
having corrective surgery or prosthetics?

498
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:07,511
- <i>I know a doctor that might be able to help you.</i>
- I'd like to meet him.

499
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:11,140
We'll give that name after the show.
Thank you. That's nice.

500
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:13,517
Anyone else? Yes. Stand right up.

501
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:18,272
- But if you had regular hands you'd be like everyone else.
- Yes, I know.

502
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:22,693
- I think he'd like that.
- But then no one would think you were special.

503
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:24,903
<i>You wouldn't be on TV or anything.</i>

504
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:29,408
No matter what,
Edward will always be special.

505
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:36,957
More questions? Yes. Stand right up.

506
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:40,085
Your work is so interesting,
distinctive and unique.

507
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:44,715
- Do you have any plans to open your own beauty salon?
- <i>Oh, there's an idea!</i>

508
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:51,138
Anyone else?
Uh, yeah. Stand right up.

509
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:54,808
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- Aww!

510
00:55:58,271 --> 00:56:00,689
- Sure he does. Right, Kim?
- Right, Kim?

511
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:04,443
- Great. Now you got him started.
- Knock it off, bubble-butt.

512
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,695
- You did it.
- So?

513
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:11,366
How about it, Edward?
Is there some special lady in your life?

514
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:17,790
Ooh.

515
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:43,273
Uh, everything's all right.

516
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:46,777
We'll take a break
and be right back after these messages.

517
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:49,905
Why are you laughing? He got hurt!

518
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,324
- Just a little shock. What do you care?
- "A little shock"?

519
00:56:52,408 --> 00:56:54,618
I wish we'd been taping that.

520
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:57,538
I'd give my left nut
to see that again.

521
00:56:57,664 --> 00:57:01,500
Aren't you excited?
Oh, this is just so thrilling.

522
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:05,420
Wait, I'll show it to you. It's just perfect.
It's just what we've been looking for.

523
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:09,967
I want to call it Shear Heaven.

524
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:12,719
Oh! And here we are!

525
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:15,973
Now, all along here,
I'm gonna put a row of new mirrors.

526
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:18,517
And back along here, well, I think...

527
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,686
Eddie. Come along, darling.

528
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,689
Back up here, a whole row
of new cosmetics.

529
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:26,483
And all along this row here...

530
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:29,403
Peg could sell cosmetics.

531
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:33,824
Yeah. Sure. And this, of course,
is where we wash the hair.

532
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:37,744
And here is where I stand
when I greet the customers.

533
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:41,165
But back in here is what
I really want to show you...

534
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:45,919
Eddie.

535
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:49,089
This is what I really
want to show you.

536
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:51,884
Now, this is the storeroom
where we keep everything.

537
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:56,680
What I need from you today
is a decision I need you to help me make.

538
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:59,558
<i>Oh, honey, no! Don't. That's dangerous.</i>

539
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:02,394
Now, you just sit right down there.

540
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:09,067
I have some smocks.
Would you like me to model them for you?

541
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,944
Yes.

542
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:43,101
Now, this is my favorite...

543
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,312
because it's yellow...

544
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:48,899
And what it's for...

545
00:58:50,526 --> 00:58:54,571
is to catch those itchy little trimmings
that fall down in your neck.

546
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,910
And then there's this
old purple one, you know...

547
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:03,080
you just kind of
drape around you like this.

548
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:09,002
- I like that one.
- Oh, Eddie.

549
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:12,798
Why, Eddie, you're trembling.

550
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:18,053
So am I.

551
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,599
I have been waiting
for this moment for so long.

552
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:04,349
Edward!

553
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:07,394
Edward, you come back here!
You can't do that!

554
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:23,327
<i>Velcro, sweetheart.
Velcro, and it hangs on the dashboard.</i>

555
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:25,829
- I've never seen that.
- Sorry I'm late.

556
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:29,916
Hi, Edward. Sorry, dear.
We had to order without you. Here you go.

557
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:32,711
So, Edward, did you have
a productive day?

558
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,714
Mrs. Monroe showed me
where the salon's going to be.

559
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:38,925
- You could have a cosmetics counter.
- Wouldn't that be great?

560
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,053
Great.

561
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:45,515
And then she showed me the backroom,
where she took all of her clothes off.

562
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:49,353
<i>Edward, I can't tell you how thrilled I am.
I'm just as pleased as punch.</i>

563
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:52,356
This whole beauty parlor venture's
gonna teach you volumes.

564
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,108
There's nothing like running
your own business.

565
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:58,070
I've never done it myself,
but from what I gather...

566
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:01,031
it's the greatest satisfaction
a working man can have.

567
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:04,868
So I guess the bank's
gonna be your next step, huh?

568
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:10,082
- The bank?
- Yeah, take out a loan, get yourself started.

569
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,250
<i>Nothing to worry about.</i>

570
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:16,046
<i>With your talent and reputation,
it's gonna be a snap.</i>

571
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:18,799
Yeah.

572
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:24,554
<i>No credit.
No record of jobs you've held.</i>

573
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:29,101
No savings. No personal investments.

574
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:32,145
No Social Security number.
You may as well not even exist.

575
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,314
There is no collateral.

576
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:37,067
No, we already have
a second on the house.

577
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:39,403
But don't the testimonials
make a difference?

578
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:43,240
Did you see here?
The mayor's wife can't wait to become a client.

579
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:45,409
We simply can't do it.

580
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:48,829
Now, get yourself
a Social Security card, establish credit...

581
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:50,997
and buy yourself a car.

582
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:54,251
You have a decided advantage.
You can get one of those handicapped placards.

583
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:56,586
No problem. Park anywhere you like.

584
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:02,509
I can't believe it.
It's just an outrage.

585
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:05,303
But don't you worry.
This isn't the end of it.

586
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,681
We'll get your money somehow.

587
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:11,435
But that's breaking and entering.

588
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:15,772
My parents have insurance up the rear.
What'll it cost them? A little hassle?

589
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:18,817
- A week, and my dad will have a new and better everything.
- We can't.

590
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:22,320
- Look, there's a guy who'll give us cash for this stuff.
- Jim, I don't want to.

591
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:26,032
You don't want us to have our own van
like Denny's where we can be by ourselves?

592
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,827
- With a mattress in the back?
- Why can't you just do it?

593
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:32,038
My father keeps the damn room locked.
We need Edward to get us in.

594
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:34,499
Can't you take the key, like,
when he's sleeping or something?

595
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:37,544
The only thing
he hangs onto tighter is his dick.

596
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:39,796
Come on, Kim.
Razor blades will do anything for you.

597
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:42,674
- What do you mean? That's not true.
- No? Why don't you ask him?

598
01:02:42,758 --> 01:02:46,303
- That's not fair.
- What's fair got to do with it? There isn't any other way.

599
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:48,472
There's gotta be.

600
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:53,226
Look, I've wracked my brain.
Don't you want us to have our own van?

601
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:55,395
Yeah.

602
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:59,733
<i>Jim, the lights are on.</i>

603
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:03,069
No. Those go on automatically.
They're gone for the weekend. I told you.

604
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:05,989
- That's right. In case of burglars.
- You turned off the alarm?

605
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:08,158
What do you think?
Come on. Let's go.

606
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:10,494
I hate this.
I can't believe this is happening.

607
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:14,080
- Are you sure he doesn't know this is Jim's house?
- He's never been here.

608
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:16,750
- This person stole from you?
- Shh! Keep your voice down.

609
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:19,336
I told you, he stole.
Come on. Let's go.

610
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,713
Tell his parents,
and they'll make him give it back.

611
01:03:21,797 --> 01:03:24,508
Shh. I already tried,
but the guy's parents are like he is.

612
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:28,428
You told Kim you'd do this.
Come on. Let's go. Come on. Come on!

613
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:31,431
Come on.

614
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:36,394
Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on.

615
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:39,814
Come on. Come on!
Come on! Oh, my God. Come on.

616
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:07,092
The bastard had it wired separately.
Come on!

617
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:09,469
- No, Jim! We can't just leave him here!
- Come on!

618
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:17,561
Come on! Come on! Keep moving!

619
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:19,729
- Come on.
- I can't do this!

620
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:22,065
- Come on, Kim.
- Stop!

621
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:24,192
Put me down!

622
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,306
We know you're in there.

623
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:59,352
<i>We're in the process of deactivating
the system so that you can come out.</i>

624
01:05:11,532 --> 01:05:13,617
- Denny, turn around!
- No way.

625
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:16,870
Jim, it's your house.
They can't arrest you for setting off the alarm.

626
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:20,123
- We'll just... We'll tell 'em we freaked and ran!
- We're not going back there.

627
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:23,001
- We have to go back!
- No, because my father would prosecute!

628
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:27,213
- His own son?
- Especially his own son! If Edward tells, I'll kill him!

629
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:29,382
- Denny, turn around!
- No!

630
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:31,635
- Turn around! You have to!
- No!

631
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:35,805
We want your hands high in the air
where we can see them.

632
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:42,562
<i>Your hands up!</i>

633
01:05:47,943 --> 01:05:50,862
He's got something in his hands...
looks like knives.

634
01:05:50,946 --> 01:05:53,406
Drop your weapons!

635
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:56,326
<i>I repeat... drop your weapons!</i>

636
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:59,079
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
This is your last warning.

637
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:01,206
Drop your weapons.

638
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:08,505
<i>If you fail to do so,
we'll have to open fire.</i>

639
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:12,342
<i>Don't make us do that, buddy!
Drop your weapons!</i>

640
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:15,345
<i>Drop them now!</i>

641
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:18,098
Looks like we got a psycho.
Prepare to fire!

642
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:20,266
- No, no, no!
- Get back!

643
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:23,395
Those are his hands! Those aren't weapons!
Those are his hands!

644
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,605
Please, we know him.

645
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,817
All right. Cuff him.

646
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:37,867
- But we can see him now?
- You can see him now.

647
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:41,121
- We're gonna have to hold him overnight for observation.
- He has to stay all night?

648
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:44,374
- You can pick him up in the morning.
- Oh, dear.

649
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:46,543
Oh, Edward.

650
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:51,464
Hello, Edward.
Oh, Edward, dear. I blame myself.

651
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:54,467
<i>What in God's name was going
through your mind, son?</i>

652
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:56,636
<i>Why didn't I set
a better example?</i>

653
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:59,597
<i>You saw how I envied
Jim's parents their money.</i>

654
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:02,392
What were you gonna do
with that stuff once you had it?

655
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:05,228
I blithely say, "Oh, we'll get money
for the salon somehow."

656
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:07,397
But I never meant stealing.

657
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:09,733
<i>Dear, stealing's not
the way to get it.</i>

658
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:12,235
<i>Stealing's not the way
to get anything.</i>

659
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:15,655
<i>Except trouble,
and you're in a serious heap of that.</i>

660
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:18,241
Oh, Edward,
why ever did you do this?

661
01:07:18,325 --> 01:07:22,078
- Damn those TV programs.
- Damn them all to hell.

662
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,664
<i>Or did somebody put you up to this?</i>

663
01:07:37,052 --> 01:07:39,262
Will he be okay, Doc?

664
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:42,140
The years spent in isolation
have not equipped him...

665
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:44,934
with the tools necessary
to judge right from wrong.

666
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:48,146
He's had no context.
He's been completely without guidance.

667
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:52,275
Furthermore, his work...
the garden sculptures, hairstyles and so forth...

668
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:56,362
indicate that he's
a highly imaginative, uh, character.

669
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:58,948
It seems clear that his awareness
of what we call "reality"...

670
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:01,034
is radically underdeveloped.

671
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:04,037
But will he be <i>all right</i> out there?

672
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:06,206
Oh, yeah, he'll be fine.

673
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:15,799
Listen, it could keep me up all night
worrying about you.

674
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:18,551
You watch yourself, you hear?

675
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:26,851
I just happened to be up,
so I heard all this noise and I ran out.

676
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:31,314
All along, I felt in my gut there was
something wrong with him.

677
01:08:31,398 --> 01:08:33,483
It could have been my house.

678
01:08:33,567 --> 01:08:36,569
- It could have been any of our houses, but...
- <i>I warned you, didn't I?</i>

679
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:39,239
I saw the sign of Satan on him.

680
01:08:39,323 --> 01:08:42,033
You didn't heed my warning,
but now you will...

681
01:08:42,117 --> 01:08:44,410
because now you can see it too.

682
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:02,011
Edward, just stay right here.

683
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:04,597
- What do you have to say in your defense?
- Nothing.

684
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:07,392
- He doesn't want to talk right now.
- You have to say something.

685
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:09,727
- What?
- No, h-he can't talk right now.

686
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:12,188
- He can't talk.
- No comments? No remarks?

687
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:14,858
So, were you set up?
What was going through your mind?

688
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:18,069
- We have to get in the house!
- What do you have to say for yourself?

689
01:09:18,153 --> 01:09:22,448
- He'll talk to you later.
- One comment. Just one comment.

690
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,576
Oh, for goodness sakes, Lois.

691
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:28,454
I'm gonna see you at our Christmas party
before I get you here for your haircut.

692
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:31,374
Of course we're gonna have it this year.
We have it every year.

693
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:34,377
Why wouldn't we have it this year?

694
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:40,508
Well, you may think that,
but you're wrong.

695
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:46,890
You're here.

696
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:51,060
They didn't hurt you, did they?

697
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:55,648
Were you scared?

698
01:09:59,194 --> 01:10:01,654
I tried to make Jim go back...

699
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:04,741
but you can't make Jim do anything.

700
01:10:10,247 --> 01:10:12,749
Thank you for not
telling them that we...

701
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:15,919
You're welcome.

702
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:21,883
It must have been awful
when they told you whose house it was.

703
01:10:23,677 --> 01:10:26,804
I knew it was Jim's house.

704
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:28,973
<i>You did?</i>

705
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,059
Yes.

706
01:10:32,853 --> 01:10:35,063
Well, then why'd you do it?

707
01:10:36,523 --> 01:10:39,192
Because you asked me to.

708
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:45,365
<i>Kimba! Kimmy!</i>

709
01:10:45,449 --> 01:10:47,533
<i>Hey!</i>

710
01:10:53,874 --> 01:10:56,709
- Don't!
- What's the matter with you?

711
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:59,212
When are you gonna stop?
I did what I could.

712
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:03,007
My old man thinks he's retarded. Otherwise he'd
still be in jail. What more do you want from me?

713
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,802
- You could tell the truth.
- So could you! You were there too.

714
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:10,306
- It wasn't my idea. You know I didn't want to do it.
- But you did do it.

715
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:14,310
I don't get why you give such a shit anyway.

716
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:48,678
<i>We're gonna try and help you find
a way to replace the drapes and the towels...</i>

717
01:11:48,762 --> 01:11:52,432
<i>but our confidence in you, Edward,
is not gonna be so easy to replace.</i>

718
01:11:52,516 --> 01:11:54,934
<i>Dad.</i>

719
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:57,687
Okay. A little ethics.

720
01:11:57,771 --> 01:12:02,233
You're walking down the street, find a suitcase
full of money. There's nobody around.

721
01:12:02,317 --> 01:12:05,194
No human person is in evidence.
What do you do?

722
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:07,613
<i>"A": you keep the money.</i>

723
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:12,243
<i>"B": you use it to buy gifts
for your friends and your loved ones.</i>

724
01:12:12,327 --> 01:12:15,705
"C": you give it to the poor.

725
01:12:15,789 --> 01:12:19,208
"D": you turn it in to the police.

726
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:21,627
- Dad, this is really stupid.
- Kim!

727
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:24,047
- I'd keep the money.
- Simmer down.

728
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:26,466
Edward?

729
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:30,511
<i>Hey, how 'bout after dinner we go down
to the bowling alley? That would be fun.</i>

730
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:34,557
- You're not seeing Jim tonight?
- No.

731
01:12:34,641 --> 01:12:37,143
You know, we had the coolest
show-and-tell today.

732
01:12:37,227 --> 01:12:40,938
This kid brought in
a box of baby possums... 10, maybe 12...

733
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:43,107
totally naked, no hair at all.

734
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:46,194
Honey, this is fascinating,
but I don't think your father's finished yet.

735
01:12:46,278 --> 01:12:49,405
Thank you, dear.
Edward, we're waiting.

736
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:54,577
Give it to my loved ones?

737
01:12:56,747 --> 01:13:00,625
<i>Oh, Edward, it does seem
that that's what you should do...</i>

738
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:02,835
but it's not.

739
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:10,718
You dope! Everybody knows
you're supposed to give it to the police.

740
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,012
Good thinking, Kevin.

741
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:15,807
Well, think about it, you guys.

742
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:19,227
I mean, that's the nicer thing to do.
That's what I would do.

743
01:13:19,311 --> 01:13:22,855
We're not trying to confuse him.
We're trying to make things a bit easier for him.

744
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:25,233
So let's cut the comedy
for a little while.

745
01:13:25,317 --> 01:13:28,444
I am being serious, Dad.
It's a much nicer thing to do.

746
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:31,114
Well, we're not talking nice.
We're talking right and wrong.

747
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:33,699
- Shut up!
- Oh, goodness sake.

748
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:36,619
No wonder poor Edward can't learn
right from wrong...

749
01:13:36,703 --> 01:13:38,788
living in this family!

750
01:13:38,872 --> 01:13:41,874
Well, did you hear what he did
to Peg's curtains?

751
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:44,836
It's unbelievable that they're having
their Christmas party anyway.

752
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,672
- Are you going?
- I don't think so.

753
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:50,800
He practically raped Joyce, you know,
threatening her with those knives of his.

754
01:13:50,884 --> 01:13:52,969
It's a miracle she escaped.

755
01:13:53,053 --> 01:13:55,304
Oh, I don't have anything
against Bill and Peg, but...

756
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:58,307
I know, I know. And they've got
that teenaged daughter in the house.

757
01:13:58,392 --> 01:14:03,479
Oh, those poor things.
After what happened to me. Can you imagine?

758
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:05,940
What did you say to Peg
about the Christmas party?

759
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:10,069
- I said I hoped we could make it.
- I lied too.

760
01:14:29,923 --> 01:14:32,925
Edward? You want to
give me that new haircut?

761
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:35,845
- Again?
- <i>Yeah. Sure.</i>

762
01:14:35,929 --> 01:14:40,266
It makes me proud to have you
as my own personal hairdresser.

763
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:44,520
-</i> Hi, honey.</i>
- Oh, hi.

764
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:47,607
- Kevin, you wanna play "Scissors, paper, stone"?
- No.

765
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:51,194
- Why?
- It's boring. I'm tired of always winning.

766
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:54,197
- Other people's feelings... A few manners!
- I'll be outside.

767
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:56,365
Just never you mind, dear.

768
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,951
Just... You cut away. Cut away.

769
01:15:21,808 --> 01:15:25,311
It needs something... else.
What do you think, honey?

770
01:15:25,395 --> 01:15:28,314
- More bells?
- More bells. Okay.

771
01:15:28,398 --> 01:15:31,108
Mom, do you really think
we should be having this party?

772
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:34,737
Of course I think we should
be having this party. Of course I do.

773
01:15:34,821 --> 01:15:37,490
It's just what we need
just to calm things down.

774
01:15:37,574 --> 01:15:41,535
And everything will just
go back to normal. Hmm?

775
01:15:42,996 --> 01:15:45,706
Do you have any more bells, honey?

776
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:33,773
Hey!

777
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:39,403
<i>Now you've done it.</i>

778
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:42,031
It's just a scratch, Jim.
Really, it's okay.

779
01:17:42,115 --> 01:17:44,367
Stay back! Touch her again,
and I'll kill you.

780
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:46,952
- <i>It's no big deal.</i>
- Call a doctor. He skewered Kim.

781
01:17:47,037 --> 01:17:49,789
- No! He didn't skewer me.
- Stay away from her, okay? I mean it.

782
01:17:49,873 --> 01:17:51,957
You can't touch anything
without destroying it.

783
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:54,210
Who the hell do you think
you are, hanging around?

784
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:58,881
I want you to sit right down
and wait for me to bring you some ice.

785
01:17:58,965 --> 01:18:01,384
Stay right there.
I'll be right back.

786
01:18:07,474 --> 01:18:09,809
Get the hell out of here!

787
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:13,145
<i>Get the hell out! Go! Freak!</i>

788
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:15,981
Hey, Edward! Where you goin'?

789
01:18:23,698 --> 01:18:25,950
- Where is he?
- He tried to hurt you.

790
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:29,161
- No, he did not, and you know it.
- Are you nuts?

791
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:32,998
- I just saw him!
- Jim, I don't love you anymore.

792
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:36,001
I just want you to go!
Okay? Just go!

793
01:18:36,086 --> 01:18:38,170
Are you serious?

794
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:40,965
I'm gonna lose you to that?
He isn't even human.

795
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:43,634
Just get out of here! Okay? Just go!

796
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:53,644
Dad, did you see where Edward went?

797
01:18:53,728 --> 01:18:56,439
Oh, I don't know.
He just waltzed down the street.

798
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:59,358
- We have to go find him, Mom.
- Your father will find him.

799
01:18:59,443 --> 01:19:03,028
Go on in the house.
I'll take care of it. I'll go find him.

800
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:25,217
Oh! Edward! I'm calling the police!

801
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:17,561
All that blood, sweetie,
and it was just a little cut.

802
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:19,772
Oh.

803
01:20:25,612 --> 01:20:28,531
Hello, Mrs. Boggs.
I'm here to see the man with the hands.

804
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:32,535
Oh. Uh...

805
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:35,538
He's not here. Thank you.

806
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:38,040
Oh, dear.

807
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:43,379
- Helen. Helen, did you actually see him?
- Yes! Look!

808
01:20:43,463 --> 01:20:46,966
Don't start, everyone!

809
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:51,679
I'm looking for the man
with the scissors.

810
01:20:51,763 --> 01:20:55,182
- Thank God you're here.
- He went right down there that way.

811
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:58,602
All right. Calm down. Calm down.
Go on home. We'll handle it.

812
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:00,771
Just go home.

813
01:21:00,855 --> 01:21:03,566
- He's a demon. A demon.
- You've gotta catch him.

814
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:06,402
- You've gotta do something!
- I think he's at my house.

815
01:21:12,242 --> 01:21:15,411
I'm sure your father
will find him soon.

816
01:21:15,495 --> 01:21:17,997
What time is it?

817
01:21:18,081 --> 01:21:22,251
It's almost 8:30. Great party, huh?

818
01:21:22,335 --> 01:21:24,962
Where are they?

819
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:27,673
God, I hope he's okay.

820
01:21:27,757 --> 01:21:29,842
So do I, honey.

821
01:21:34,264 --> 01:21:39,435
You know, when I brought Edward
down here to live with us...

822
01:21:39,519 --> 01:21:43,022
I really didn't
think things through.

823
01:21:43,106 --> 01:21:46,442
And I didn't think about
what could happen to him...

824
01:21:47,694 --> 01:21:49,778
or to us...

825
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:53,365
or to the neighborhood.

826
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:55,743
And now I think that maybe...

827
01:21:57,412 --> 01:22:00,789
it might be best if he goes...

828
01:22:00,874 --> 01:22:03,709
back up there.

829
01:22:03,793 --> 01:22:06,545
Because at least there, he's safe.

830
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:11,592
And we'd just go back to normal.

831
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:16,847
Well, I got halfway to the Whitmans'.
I didn't see him anywhere.

832
01:22:16,931 --> 01:22:20,225
<i>Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
Well, let's get in the car and go look for him.</i>

833
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:22,394
- Where's Kevin now?
- He's at Max's.

834
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:25,481
Oh, for God's sakes.
Where do you think you're going, young lady?

835
01:22:25,565 --> 01:22:28,692
- With you guys.
- No, you're staying here in case somebody shows up.

836
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:30,903
We'll be right back, dear.

837
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:12,653
Police.

838
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:50,816
Edward?

839
01:23:53,027 --> 01:23:55,154
Are you okay?

840
01:23:56,489 --> 01:23:59,408
Yes. Are you okay?

841
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:04,288
Where is everybody?

842
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:08,167
Out looking for you.

843
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:15,048
Hold me.

844
01:24:28,855 --> 01:24:31,398
I can't.

845
01:24:58,718 --> 01:25:02,471
I know it's a little early
for Christmas, Edward...

846
01:25:02,555 --> 01:25:04,598
but, uh...

847
01:25:06,601 --> 01:25:09,478
I have a present for you.

848
01:27:06,679 --> 01:27:11,266
<i>Forget holding her hand.
Picture the damage he could do other places.</i>

849
01:27:11,351 --> 01:27:14,853
Yeah. That's sick.

850
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:22,611
I feel like I'm gonna pass out
or puke or something.

851
01:27:22,695 --> 01:27:25,197
Later. First take me to her house.

852
01:27:25,281 --> 01:27:28,742
- Oh, come on, Jim. Don't make me drive.
- Just do it!

853
01:27:28,826 --> 01:27:31,453
Jesus. Maybe she
was right about you.

854
01:27:31,537 --> 01:27:33,580
- Just drive!
- Relax!

855
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:40,420
- See you tomorrow. Call me.
- All right.

856
01:27:58,898 --> 01:28:01,274
Have they caught him yet?

857
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:05,278
- Who?
- Him... that cripple.

858
01:28:07,532 --> 01:28:10,909
Yeah. Let me know when they do.

859
01:28:12,996 --> 01:28:15,914
Let us all know, okay?

860
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:18,083
Like a good boy.

861
01:28:38,104 --> 01:28:40,230
Kevin.

862
01:28:44,527 --> 01:28:48,447
Are you okay? Oh! It's okay.

863
01:28:48,531 --> 01:28:51,950
<i>Ow! Ow! Ow!</i>

864
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:55,412
<i>Edward, stop. Stop.</i>

865
01:28:55,496 --> 01:28:57,789
- Don't! Stop!
- <i>Edward, stop!</i>

866
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:01,585
<i>Somebody help us!</i>

867
01:29:01,669 --> 01:29:05,964
- <i>Help!</i>
- What are you doing? Get away from him! Ow!

868
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:13,180
<i>Somebody call the police!</i>

869
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,725
- Let go of me!
- Why?

870
01:29:16,809 --> 01:29:19,102
Kevin!

871
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:22,898
- Hey! Get off of him!
- Kevin!

872
01:29:25,234 --> 01:29:29,112
- Get away!
- Edward, come home. Come home.

873
01:29:37,622 --> 01:29:40,290
Stop it! Stop!

874
01:29:58,851 --> 01:30:00,894
Run.

875
01:30:28,506 --> 01:30:31,967
Kevin's all right!
It was just the tiniest scratch.

876
01:30:32,051 --> 01:30:35,011
And he's gone.
Let's not bother him. All right?

877
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:37,889
Let's just leave him alone.

878
01:30:44,814 --> 01:30:46,898
Go on, run.

879
01:30:51,237 --> 01:30:53,321
- What happened?
- Okay, is he dead?

880
01:30:53,406 --> 01:30:58,160
- Did you get him?
- It's all over. Go on home. There's nothing more to see.

881
01:30:58,244 --> 01:31:00,662
- What happened out there?
- I don't want to go home!

882
01:31:00,746 --> 01:31:02,914
I want to know.
I want some answers from you.

883
01:31:02,999 --> 01:31:05,083
It is all over.

884
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:08,879
<i>Where is he? Where is he?</i>

885
01:31:08,963 --> 01:31:12,841
Get back here!
I want to ask you something!

886
01:31:13,968 --> 01:31:16,595
Hey, I want to ask you.

887
01:31:17,805 --> 01:31:20,056
- Did you see...
- Look at that.

888
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:23,268
- There's nobody in that car.
- They don't have him.

889
01:31:23,352 --> 01:31:25,437
- What are we gonna do?
- I'm going.

890
01:31:25,521 --> 01:31:27,814
- No. Careful.
- That's not a good idea.

891
01:32:31,837 --> 01:32:33,880
They're coming?

892
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:38,677
Did I hurt Kevin?

893
01:32:38,761 --> 01:32:42,597
No. He's okay.
Mostly he was just scared.

894
01:32:44,183 --> 01:32:47,477
Edward, I was so afraid.

895
01:32:47,561 --> 01:32:49,854
I thought you were dead.

896
01:32:56,612 --> 01:32:59,072
I didn't.

897
01:33:07,498 --> 01:33:10,041
No!

898
01:33:10,126 --> 01:33:12,669
No!

899
01:33:18,509 --> 01:33:20,677
<i>No! Jim!</i>

900
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:23,722
<i>Stop! No!</i>

901
01:33:38,904 --> 01:33:40,739
No!

902
01:33:44,327 --> 01:33:48,246
Stop it or I'll kill you myself.

903
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:56,921
Bullshit!

904
01:33:58,341 --> 01:34:01,092
Hey! I said stay away from her!

905
01:35:00,986 --> 01:35:03,029
Good-bye.

906
01:35:12,581 --> 01:35:16,167
I love you.

907
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:06,259
Is he in there?

908
01:36:08,095 --> 01:36:10,221
He's dead.

909
01:36:13,893 --> 01:36:16,978
The roof caved in on him.

910
01:36:17,062 --> 01:36:20,064
They killed each other.

911
01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:24,861
You can see for yourselves.

912
01:36:26,906 --> 01:36:29,616
See?

913
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:39,751
I'm going home.

914
01:36:47,468 --> 01:36:49,928
Good night.

915
01:37:07,696 --> 01:37:10,114
She never saw him again.

916
01:37:11,617 --> 01:37:13,826
Not after that night.

917
01:37:13,911 --> 01:37:15,995
How do you know?

918
01:37:23,337 --> 01:37:26,214
Because I was there.

919
01:37:26,298 --> 01:37:30,009
You could have gone up there.
You still could go.

920
01:37:31,345 --> 01:37:33,596
No, sweetheart.

921
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:36,808
I'm an old woman now.

922
01:37:36,892 --> 01:37:40,687
I would rather he remember me
the way I was.

923
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:16,848
How do you know he's still alive?

924
01:38:18,851 --> 01:38:22,270
I... don't know, not for sure.

925
01:38:22,354 --> 01:38:26,524
But... I believe he is.

926
01:38:35,701 --> 01:38:37,785
<i>You see...</i>

927
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:40,788
<i>before he came down here...</i>

928
01:38:40,873 --> 01:38:42,915
<i>it never snowed.</i>

929
01:38:46,712 --> 01:38:49,797
And afterwards...

930
01:38:49,882 --> 01:38:51,924
it did.

931
01:38:53,385 --> 01:38:55,970
If he weren't up there now...

932
01:38:56,055 --> 01:38:59,223
I don't think it would be snowing.

933
01:39:00,726 --> 01:39:04,979
Sometimes you can still
catch me dancing in it.
