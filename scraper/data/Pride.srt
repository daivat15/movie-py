1
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,820
...unprecedented violence,

2
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,072
and with the strike
entering its fourth month,

3
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,700
the government insisted
that it will push ahead

4
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,953
with plans to close 20 pits with
the loss of over 20,000 jobs,

5
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:38,456
an action that Mr. Scargill says
will destroy entire communities.

6
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:42,293
You can look back in 10
years and you can say:

7
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:46,297
"In 1984, I was proud and privileged

8
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:49,718
to be a party to the
greatest struggle on Earth."

9
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,059
I left my number.

10
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,139
Just in case.

11
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,851
Everything's at stake for me.
I'm 27 years old, right?

12
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,102
See you on the march then?

13
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,521
I'm fighting for their jobs, not me own.

14
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,064
We've used the savings up.

15
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,734
We have no money left.
All we've got is pride and self-respect,

16
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,819
and we'll carry on keeping that.

17
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,780
The prime minister today
defended her position.

18
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,323
I can't change my style.

19
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:15,410
It has to be a style of firm leadership.

20
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,127
One isn't here to be a softie.

21
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,505
You're here to be a good, firm leader.

22
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,389
- Here, Mark, do you wanna play ball?
- Tomorrow, buddy.

23
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,135
- Here you go, Mark.
- Great, thanks.

24
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,637
I've spoken to the council
about your deviant parties.

25
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:37,397
There's no need to do that.
Knock on the door, we'd let you in.

26
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,225
They're sending a policeman.

27
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,650
Oh, I do hope so.

28
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,278
Mark!

29
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,482
Thanks.

30
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,275
Then the riot squad,

31
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,527
the helmeted policemen
with their plastic shields

32
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,280
were deployed after smoke
bombs were thrown.

33
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,032
- The violence continued.
- Thanks, Dad.

34
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,833
The pickets nearly broke
through the barricade.

35
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,668
The train now approaching

36
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,095
is the 9:23 to London Victoria.

37
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,696
Is that copper really straight?

38
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,490
Two, four, six, eight.

39
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,492
Is that copper really straight?

40
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,327
Two, four, six, eight.

41
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,162
Is that copper really straight?

42
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,081
Two, four, six, eight.

43
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,048
Is that copper really straight?

44
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,514
Hey, grab a hold of this,
will you, mate?

45
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,969
- Oh, no, sorry. I...
- Five minutes till me friends get here.

46
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,222
- Come on.
- Just that I don't want to be too visible.

47
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,474
- Is it your first Pride?
- Yeah, first anything.

48
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,317
Yeah, well, this is the best way.
You need to throw yourself in.

49
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,646
The thing is,
is I'm actually from Bromley.

50
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,149
Well, don't worry about that.
We're a broad church.

51
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,818
No, it's the train. It's further
out than people think and I...

52
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,195
Oi! I been dragging this
thing since Marble Arch.

53
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,488
What, are they buckets?

54
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,866
Surprised you have to ask that,
coming from Accrington.

55
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,535
- Does anything get rid of love bites?
- No, where's Mark now?

56
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,412
- Listen up.
- Where have you been?

57
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,289
Everyone, take a bucket
and start rattling.

58
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,040
- This is for the miners.
- Miners?

59
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,458
We agreed on a banner, Mark.

60
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:30,920
It's a show of solidarity.
Who hates the miners? Thatcher.

61
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,132
Who else? The police, the public and
the tabloid press. Sound familiar?

62
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,885
- Surely, Mark...
- But the only problem we've got,

63
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,262
is Mary Whitehouse,
and that can be a matter of time.

64
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,139
- Mark...
- I know, it's not been planned.

65
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:44,941
It's not been thought through,
but it's a really good idea, isn't it?

66
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,028
Isn't it?

67
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,733
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Give it to the lesbians.

68
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,403
Oh, for God's sake. Right, looks like
you're off the hook, mate. Good lad.

69
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,955
Whatever Mark says, we do it.
Don't ask me why.

70
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,263
- Disgusting.
- Yes.

71
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:20,143
We're collecting for the
miners and their families!

72
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:26,858
Collecting for the miners
and their families, guys!

73
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:31,905
Gays and lesbians support
the miners and their families!

74
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,025
I was wondering, do you need a hand?

75
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,152
Well, well, if it isn't Bromley.

76
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,696
I mean, my last train's
actually not for ages.

77
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:42,200
- Gays and lesbians support miners!
- Gays and lesbians support miners!

78
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,495
- Gays and lesbians support miners!
- Support the miners!

79
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,871
Guys, support the miners!

80
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:50,250
Gays and lesbians support miners!

81
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,584
Collecting for miners!

82
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,544
Support the miners. Come on.

83
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:57,472
Support the miners! Support the miners!

84
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,181
It's just a couple of
the lads from college.

85
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,308
And one of them lives in Chislehurst,

86
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,894
so he can't be too late, either.
I've got my key.

87
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:13,481
Just mind yourself on that last train.
There's weirdoes and all sorts on there.

88
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,699
Thanks, Mum.

89
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,641
Hey, Bromley.

90
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,191
Over here.

91
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,491
I'm hiding from that girl.

92
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,621
- Why?
- Broke my heart at a Smiths concert.

93
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,575
I've never met a lesbian before.

94
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:09,336
Really? I've never met anyone
who irons their jeans.

95
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,751
- I live at home.
- No shit.

96
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,760
Is that where you got
that lovely brooch?

97
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,971
That's embarrassing.

98
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,091
It's today.

99
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,260
What are you, 10?

100
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,437
- I'm 20.
- I wouldn't go spreading that around.

101
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,891
You're illegal, darling.

102
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,894
Sixteen for the breeders,
21 for the gays.

103
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,104
Did you learn nothing on that march?

104
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,197
You're still a minor.

105
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,152
- Jesus.
- Victory to the minors.

106
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,412
- Don't make a mess, okay?
- They've counted it.

107
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,333
Well, come on,
you've collected as much as anyone.

108
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,372
Stephanie, were you with
Jeff in The Bell last night?

109
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:56,966
For fuck's sake, it's a bruise, okay?
My neck is bruised.

110
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,462
No red wine on the floor, please.

111
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,804
Ashtrays!

112
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,132
It was a pretty good march today.

113
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,468
Not much in the way
of beatings or abuse.

114
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,470
Hardly any petrol bombs or swastikas.

115
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,430
Is it me or are the police getting soft?

116
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,227
It's funny, they've stopped hanging
around outside our clubs lately.

117
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,396
What's that about?

118
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,940
Do you think they finally got
sick of all that Donna Summer?

119
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,900
Yeah, headline.

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,320
My guess is they went somewhere else.

121
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,122
To pick on someone else.

122
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:31,619
My guess is that while we're
enjoying a temporary reprieve,

123
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:32,961
they're here.

124
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:37,291
Giving these poor sods
the shit we usually get.

125
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:41,754
Now, these mining communities
are being bullied just like we are.

126
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,423
Right? Bullied by the police,

127
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,925
bullied by the tabloids,
bullied by the government.

128
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,969
- Do any of them need a hug?
- No.

129
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,388
What they need is cash.
And they need it urgently.

130
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,557
Because the miners have
always come to our aid.

131
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,893
- Are you kidding me? Are you...?
- Why don't we talk about today?

132
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,937
Today, with only a couple of buckets,

133
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,857
we raised nearly 200 quid.

134
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,569
Right? Think what we could achieve
if we really started trying.

135
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,196
- I'm from Durham.
- You know what we're talking about.

136
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,949
I know those bastards kicked the
shit out of me every morning

137
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,208
on my way to school.

138
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,211
And every night on my way home.

139
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,756
We are proposing to meet
at least once a week

140
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,758
and just to do as many
collections as we can.

141
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,268
Oh, and we've got a name.

142
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,021
LGSM.

143
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,101
Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners.

144
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:40,104
- It's not very catchy.
- It's a support group, not a band.

145
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:43,733
Right. Come on, let's have a show
of hands, shall we? Who's in?

146
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,610
Guys?

147
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,612
Come on, guys, please.

148
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,698
- Oh, come on, guys.
- Is that it?

149
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:54,327
We've actually been looking for
things to do together as a couple.

150
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,913
Perfect. Youse can feed the
miners and your relationship.

151
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,081
- How many is that?
- That's six.

152
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,333
It's better than five.

153
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,752
- Not as good as seven.
- Jonathan.

154
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,587
Oh, God, here come the gay libbers.

155
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,464
Brilliant party, Geth.

156
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,299
I'm sure you could use the backroom here

157
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,510
- if you're looking for a base, that is.
- We are.

158
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,428
We are. That's amazing.
Gethin, thank you.

159
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:13,971
And what about me and Jonathan?

160
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,098
Or is it exclusively for the under 25s?

161
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,059
- No.
- Of course not. Everyone's welcome.

162
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,144
Touch me, baby, tainted love

163
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,647
You sure Jonathan's interested?

164
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,320
He's at a bit of a loose end.

165
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,114
He just needs something
to occupy him. A project.

166
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,534
What about Bromley over there?

167
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,036
I... I've just started catering college.

168
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:41,249
Good. Congratulations all of you.
You're the founder members

169
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,751
of Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners.

170
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,927
Terrific. Let's bring
down the government.

171
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,302
- Support for the miners.
- Give generously.

172
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,304
Put your hand in your
pockets for the miners.

173
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,730
Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners.

174
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,351
National Union of Mineworkers.

175
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,603
Oh, hello, I represent a group

176
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:06,190
called Lesbians and Gays
Support the Miners and...

177
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,074
Hello?

178
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,034
Hello...

179
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,614
And there's the desired consistency.

180
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,576
It's glossy and wobbly.

181
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,002
Glossy and wobbly.

182
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,460
Jonathan?

183
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,504
Why don't you go out with them today?

184
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:32,557
Because I've got better things to do
than run around with a bunch of kids.

185
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,269
What happened to gay lib, Jonathan?

186
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:40,231
I don't know. What did happen to it?

187
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,268
Is that Gethin's boyfriend?

188
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,570
Jonathan. He stabbed Susannah
York with an ice pick.

189
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,774
He's an actor.

190
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,235
- Support the miners!
- Lesbians and Gays

191
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,154
Support the Miners, sir.

192
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,406
Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners.

193
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,784
We've raised some money and we're
looking for a mining community...

194
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,585
Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners.

195
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,872
Somebody will call you back.

196
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,632
Sure, but you've said
that before and we...

197
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,220
They'll call back.

198
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,806
They will.

199
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,636
Mark, face it.

200
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,513
- They're on strike. They're busy.
- They don't wanna take our money

201
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,182
- because we're poufs.
- And a dyke.

202
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,018
- They'd rather starve.
- Hand the money over anonymously.

203
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,395
- We don't have to say we're gay.
- No.

204
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,647
At least, we'd be helping.

205
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,740
This is a gay and lesbian group,
and we are unapologetic about that.

206
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,736
- Why are you wasting time with this?
- Mark!

207
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,322
They will call. Nothing to do
with the fact that we're poufs.

208
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,874
- And a dyke.
- They will call us. End of meeting.

209
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,912
They're never gonna call us back.

210
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,963
Someone needs to go with him.

211
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,750
First rule of the group.

212
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,044
- I'll go.
- Thank you, Steph.

213
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:55,424
Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners!

214
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,009
Pervert.

215
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:00,395
First rule of the group, comrade.
Nobody collects alone.

216
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,940
Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners!

217
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,312
- Lesbians and Gays Support...
- Gethin!

218
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:11,232
- You're supposed to be a bookshop.
- We don't have maps, Mark.

219
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,567
People ask for the
poems of Walt Whitman.

220
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,153
I hope there's a good reason
why I've been abandoned.

221
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,614
Let me get this right.
So we are gonna pick a mining town

222
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,283
at random, and just ring.
Is that the plan, is it, Mark?

223
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,535
The town hall, the council.

224
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,203
- It's as easy as that.
- Why not?

225
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,955
We bypass the union altogether.

226
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,581
- I think it's inspired.
- So do I.

227
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,042
- See, even Bromley agrees.
- Right, here we go.

228
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,678
Aha! So, what do we want?

229
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,590
- Somewhere north, industrial.
- Humberside, is that a place?

230
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,884
Oh, Jesus Christ, give it to me.

231
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,387
If it's miners you're looking for,

232
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,473
- there, Wales.
- Of course.

233
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:48,359
- That's a big fucking coalfield.
- That's the Brecon Beacons.

234
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,983
That's the coalfield there, and that is.

235
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,944
- And what are we supposed to do?
- Do you know people, Gethin?

236
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,113
No, I haven't been back there
in 16 years.

237
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,489
Why not?

238
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:04,118
Well, let's just say there isn't
always a welcome in the hillsides.

239
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,585
Shall I get the phone book?

240
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,498
Well, what's the worst that can happen?

241
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,084
Oh, hello, I represent a bunch
of screaming homosexuals.

242
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,086
May I inquire about your communal baths?

243
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:18,048
- What's that got to do with a strike?
- Oh, nothing. I'd just like to inquire.

244
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,425
Please, can I have some...?

245
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,843
All right, thank you.

246
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,137
All right! Hey!

247
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,563
If we're gonna do this,
we need to take it seriously.

248
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,067
Have a look.

249
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,235
Right.

250
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,905
O, one, nine...

251
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,279
What's the Welsh for lesbian?

252
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,024
Hello?

253
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,402
Yes.

254
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,454
I see.

255
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,786
- Yeah!
- Yes!

256
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,879
Solidarity forever

257
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:40,388
Solidarity forever

258
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,925
Didn't occur to you
to get a description?

259
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,260
She were off the phone fast.

260
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,303
Maybe we should try and
look more obviously gay.

261
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,389
Achievable goals, please, Jeff.

262
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,308
- Shut up. That's him.
- Are you sure?

263
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,644
- God, he's coming.
- How did you know it were him?

264
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,021
It's the same as in a nightclub.
It's all in the eyes.

265
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,399
I'm Dai Donavan. From the Dulais Valley.

266
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,900
- Right.
- You must be Mark.

267
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,111
- Yes. Hello.
- Hi. Mike.

268
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,362
- How you doing?
- Steph.

269
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,864
- Joe.
- Jeff.

270
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,824
Dai. So...

271
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:11,127
LGSM, what does that stand for, then?

272
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,666
You get a garbled
message over the phone.

273
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,918
I thought the L was for London.

274
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,129
London something.

275
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,382
I never dreamed for a
moment it was L for...

276
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,266
Hi.

277
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,889
This money you've raised,
it's all from gays and lesbians?

278
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,064
Mostly. Yeah.

279
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,442
Right.

280
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,521
- There we are.
- This is just the beginning.

281
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,655
- Oh.
- We've got big plans.

282
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:43,868
Well, I'm not going to pretend I'm
not surprised. You can see that.

283
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:48,282
Truth told, you're the first
gays I've ever met in my life.

284
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,916
As far as you're aware.

285
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,077
That's true.

286
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,253
And you're the first
miner I've ever met.

287
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,457
- Yeah.
- Me too.

288
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,338
Now, I... I want you to
do something for me.

289
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,298
I want you to go back to your community

290
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,176
and convey my thanks, my personal thanks

291
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,178
and the thanks of all
the people of Dulais.

292
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,520
Yeah, of course we will.

293
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,599
- Won't we?
- Yeah.

294
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,524
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

295
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,652
Won't we, Mark?

296
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,690
Who fancies a pint?

297
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,370
You can have five minutes.

298
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,704
- Are you sure?
- Dead sure.

299
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,122
Yeah, but for Dai...

300
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,124
- Oh, I'm all right, lad.
- Trust me, Dai,

301
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,585
if you can handle this,
it's gonna make a huge difference.

302
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:44,797
What's he gonna do,
take his clothes off?

303
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,048
I'm going to say thank you.

304
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,266
Well, don't blame me if you get bottled.

305
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,850
Right! Shut up, you fuckers.

306
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:02,314
Thank you. Thank you. Right, listen.
Some of you know me.

307
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,566
- My name is Mark Ashton.
- Commie!

308
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,860
I'm gonna invite somebody
onto the stage now

309
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,662
who wants to talk to you,
and I want you to listen to him.

310
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:15,452
He comes from the Dulais Valley
in South Wales, and he...

311
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,461
Well, he's a striking miner,

312
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,582
and he has something
he wants to say to you.

313
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,725
I've had a...

314
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:35,896
I've had a lot of new
experiences during this strike.

315
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,892
Speaking in public.

316
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,444
Standing on a picket line.

317
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,981
And now I'm in a gay bar.

318
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,692
Well, if you don't like it,
you can go home.

319
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,487
As a matter of fact, I do like it.

320
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,282
Beer's a bit expensive, mind.

321
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,536
But, really,

322
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,955
there's only one difference between this

323
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,416
and a bar in South Wales.

324
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,425
The women.

325
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:06,962
They're a lot more feminine in here.

326
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:15,895
What I'd really like to say
to you tonight is thank you.

327
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,309
If you're one of the people that's
put money in these buckets,

328
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:25,237
if you've supported LGSM,
then thank you,

329
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:30,027
because what you've given
us is more than money.

330
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,286
It's friendship.

331
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,406
When you're in a battle

332
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:38,626
against an enemy so much bigger,
so much stronger than you,

333
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:44,423
well, to find out you had a
friend you never knew existed,

334
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,669
well, that's the best
feeling in the world.

335
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,553
So thank you.

336
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,562
Thank you.

337
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,280
Thank you. My God.
I haven't even finished this one.

338
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,409
Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners.

339
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,246
Support the miners.

340
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,741
So you're the only girl?

341
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:21,669
That's right. I'm the L in LGSM.

342
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,793
- Good speech.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

343
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,879
I've worked a few tough
crowds myself over the years.

344
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,631
- In politics?
- In panto.

345
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,384
- Oh, all right.
- Okay, LGSM over here, please.

346
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,885
- Something we could use.
- What?

347
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,178
An official photographer.

348
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:41,223
Jesus, Mark. We don't even
have an official typewriter.

349
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,891
- Nice and close.
- I could do it.

350
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,268
I've got a camera.

351
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,562
It's a really good one.
I'd be happy to do it.

352
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,772
- Bromley, if you're sure.
- Of course he's sure.

353
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:52,192
Never let it be said that LGSM
discouraged youth enterprise.

354
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,986
Right. What are you gonna say? "Cheese"?

355
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,571
Victory to the miners.

356
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,372
Victory to the miners!

357
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,843
Martin, come on.

358
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,255
Tell them you've run a
whole canteen before.

359
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,300
- You're not just packing food parcels.
- Go.

360
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,102
And don't look so bloody worried.
It's not the first day of school.

361
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,607
Right.

362
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,653
What do they need to come here for?
We sent them a thank-you note.

363
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,405
Every other group has been invited.

364
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:41,074
Every other group was approved
by the whole committee.

365
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:43,744
- Oh, I see.
- Dai had to make a snap decision.

366
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,287
Oh, this is all my fault.

367
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,081
He was in London. Would you have
told them to keep their money?

368
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:50,792
I'll tell you what I would've done.
I would've come back.

369
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,502
All right, I run a civil meeting here.

370
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:55,005
If you want to scream and shout,
get on the pickets.

371
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:59,134
I don't have a problem
with what they are.

372
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,720
- None of us do.
- It's the men.

373
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,973
Well, you bring a load of gays
into a working men's club,

374
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,683
you get trouble. I'm sorry.

375
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,435
No other group has raised as much.

376
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:11,021
- I'm not disputing that.
- Or been so consistent.

377
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,655
Why don't you just invite them?

378
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,194
Sorry, but everyone's saying
they don't have a problem.

379
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,537
Good. They've raised the
most money, so invite them.

380
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,706
And who the bloody hell are you?

381
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,751
- You did what?
- I know.

382
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:30,499
But Hefina, she's like the head honcho,
absolutely terrifying,

383
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,834
well, she obviously can't
stand this Maureen.

384
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,052
Kids, mind the fish fingers.

385
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,136
What's the matter?
You told me not to sell myself short.

386
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,973
I'm not talking about that.
Gays and lesbians.

387
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,392
- We are trying to fit in here, Sian.
- What?

388
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,186
Volunteer, I said. Run the canteen.

389
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,897
They didn't want me on the canteen.
Wanted me on the committee.

390
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:56,275
All right, so keep your head down.
Do the paperwork.

391
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:00,112
Don't start stirring it all up,
inviting a load of gays and lesbians.

392
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,655
Oh, it's like that, is it?

393
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,741
I had you down as many things,
but prejudiced was never one of them.

394
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,118
- I'm not prejudiced.
- No?

395
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,204
I'm a realist. I know what
small towns are like, Sian,

396
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,581
and I know exactly how those
lads are going to react.

397
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:12,958
- You think so?
- I know so.

398
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:16,336
I'm standing on a bloody picket
with them day after day.

399
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:19,256
It was a majority decision.

400
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,882
The committee decided.

401
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:24,845
I hope you and your bloody committee
can guarantee their safety, Sian. I do.

402
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,062
I really do.

403
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,229
All aboard the deviants bus.

404
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:37,524
No pushing, no community singing,

405
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:41,160
and absolutely no
back-chatting the driver.

406
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,455
- Right, where are we going?
- Wales.

407
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,284
Fuck me.

408
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,161
Someone better roll
me a little spliffette.

409
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,706
What I'd like to know is,
what Bromley told his mum and dad.

410
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,542
- Yeah.
- I just... Oh, it's no big deal.

411
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:56,918
Come on.

412
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,421
I said that I was doing
so well at college,

413
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,465
they were sending me
on a residential course.

414
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,515
Doing what?

415
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,720
Choux pastry.

416
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,599
Bromley! Bromley!

417
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:16,528
Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!

418
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,423
Bit late in the day for that, isn't it?

419
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,293
That's the fourth one I've done.

420
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,295
Fast as I put them up,
they pull them down.

421
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:43,180
I'm running out of staples.

422
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:03,527
Every woman is a lesbian at heart

423
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,405
Every woman is a lesbian at heart

424
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,449
You can't possibly say that
every woman is a lesbian.

425
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,827
- Why not?
- Because they're not.

426
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,788
Esther Rantzen isn't a lesbian.
My mum is not a lesbian.

427
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,206
How do you know?

428
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:17,833
How do I know my mum's not a lesbian?

429
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,668
What he's trying to say is,
you can't make

430
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,629
grand, sweeping generalizations.

431
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,888
It's not acceptable.

432
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:30,011
Every woman is a lesbian at heart

433
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:36,685
Every woman is a lesbian at heart

434
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:41,905
Including Reggie's mum

435
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,047
Look at the map. We should have
turned left at that village.

436
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,765
How can that be a village?
It doesn't have vowels.

437
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:57,314
- Hang on a minute.
- Yes?

438
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,226
I think so.

439
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,193
Are we here?

440
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,862
We're here.

441
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,494
Oh, my God.

442
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:14,248
Come on, let's go.

443
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,648
Right, then.

444
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:01,413
- I guess we just...
- I'm starting to freak out slightly.

445
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:11,305
Dai, your gays have arrived.

446
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,977
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you.

447
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,979
Hi there. Welcome.

448
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,773
Welcome. Come on in, everybody.
Great to see you again.

449
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,867
Great to see you again.
Hello. Come on in.

450
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,695
Welcome, everybody.

451
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,614
- This is my wife, Margaret.
- Hello.

452
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,991
- How are you?
- This is Gail.

453
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,076
- And Sian, who wrote to you.
- Sian.

454
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:43,246
This is Hefina, who chairs
the welfare committee.

455
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,497
This is Gwen.

456
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:47,584
- And this is Cliff, our club secretary.
- How you doing?

457
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,545
I'm going to officiate you.

458
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:51,887
Oh, good.

459
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,093
Hold that, and name here, please.

460
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,471
And in the corresponding box,

461
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,806
the group or organization you represent.

462
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,767
In this case...

463
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,477
Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners.

464
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,312
Yep. Quite. Absolutely.

465
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,315
Thank you. Thank you
very much for having us.

466
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,526
Now, I'm hoping you can clear
something up for me about lesbians.

467
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,154
- Not now, Gwen.
- Something I was told in the market,

468
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,698
and to be honest with you,
it did surprise me...

469
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:22,042
- Let them get settled in first, shall we?
- Oh.

470
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,919
Now, who's making the speech?

471
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:25,747
A speech?

472
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,674
No big deal. One of you has to go up
on stage and say a few words.

473
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,801
Just so we know who you are, like.

474
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:34,846
I'll tell the band to shut up,
and we'll push you on.

475
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,259
And welcome, all of you.

476
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,894
To be honest,
I never thought you'd come.

477
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:55,325
Anybody else feel like
appointing themselves leader?

478
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:59,079
Didn't think so. Ahem.

479
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:10,757
A million miles from home

480
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,669
But I'm walkin'

481
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:17,257
Walkin'

482
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,843
For you

483
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:23,854
Walkin' for you

484
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,073
Now then, ladies and gentlemen,

485
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:39,821
we're joined once again by
one of our support groups,

486
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,247
Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners.

487
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:47,412
Will you, welcome their
spokesman onto the stage?

488
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,046
Thank you.

489
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,088
Thank you, Dai. Thank you,

490
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:00,390
Falling Leaves.

491
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,512
Actually, Dai Donovan made
a speech at our local pub,

492
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:07,015
and he's a pretty tough act to follow,

493
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:11,151
so maybe now is the moment for
my musical tribute to Judy Garland.

494
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:18,193
Look, we raised this money
because we wanna help you.

495
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,986
And that's it.

496
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:23,406
And we'll keep on trying to help
you for as long as you want us to

497
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,450
because we've been through

498
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,418
some of the same things
you've been through.

499
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,542
Listen, if one in five people is gay,

500
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,718
then one in five miners
must be too, right?

501
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:41,264
So that's at least a fifth of
you who's pleased to see us.

502
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:48,431
Thank you.
Thank you for inviting us here.

503
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,190
Thanks.

504
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,357
One, two, three, four...

505
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,442
Them falling leaves

506
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,319
They say that summer's done

507
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,905
The wind and rains

508
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,615
They say so too

509
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:09,536
But ain't no winter skies
Will ever shadow the sun

510
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,080
While I'm with you...

511
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,173
- Night, everybody.
- Good night, Dai.

512
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:27,144
There we are.

513
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,146
All settled in.

514
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,732
It's teething problems, love.

515
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,610
Everything will be all right
once they start to mix.

516
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,286
I'm not talking about running away.

517
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,414
I'm talking about making
a dignified exit.

518
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,874
Tomorrow before dawn.

519
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,585
We can't waltz into a town
like this, expect them not to...

520
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,795
- Slit our throats?
- Just be cautious.

521
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:04,424
I don't know about anybody else, but I don't
have to travel to get my head kicked in.

522
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,719
- I can very easily get that at home.
- Anyone who wants to go should go.

523
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,929
- I came to help.
- They don't want your help.

524
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,931
Well, they can tell me that to my face.

525
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,350
Until that time, I'm a member of LGSM.

526
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,894
I'm gonna do what I set out to do.

527
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,230
No hiding, no running away,
no apologies.

528
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,107
Me too.

529
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,234
- Yeah.
- And me.

530
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,160
And me.

531
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,036
This is a Welsh castle, mind.

532
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,045
None of your Norman rubbish.

533
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,916
According to legend,

534
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,085
the maiden Sabrina came here, see,

535
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:44,756
and became the goddess
of the River Severn.

536
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:48,718
- How'd she manage that then, Cliff?
- By drowning.

537
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,887
Sabrina fair

538
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,263
Listen where thou art sitting

539
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,849
Under the glassie cool, translucent wave

540
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,650
And so on.

541
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,187
I grew up in Northern Ireland.

542
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:02,023
I know all about what happens when
people don't talk to each other.

543
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,816
That's why I've never understood

544
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,818
what's the point of
supporting gay rights

545
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:08,446
but nobody else's rights, you know?

546
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,657
Or workers' rights,
but not women's rights.

547
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,701
It's, I don't know, illogical.

548
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:16,454
There's a lodge banner
down in the welfare,

549
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,872
over 100 years old.

550
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,333
We bring it out for special
occasions, you know?

551
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,876
I'll show it to you one day.

552
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:24,261
It's a symbol, like this, right?

553
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,047
Two hands.

554
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,556
That's what the labor movement means.
Should mean.

555
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,094
You support me, I support you,

556
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,262
whoever you are, wherever you come from,

557
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,439
shoulder to shoulder, hand to hand.

558
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,608
Dai!

559
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,987
There they go.

560
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,942
They're bringing the men
from London, from Bristol, all over.

561
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,903
They're pulling the lads
in for anything now.

562
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,279
They can't do that.

563
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,991
There's two from my street in
custody right now. Lee and Carl.

564
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,034
Where's your humanity?

565
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,870
We're citizens of this country, mind.
Citizens.

566
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,248
No, I mean, they can't do that.

567
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,924
It's totally illegal.

568
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,920
A police officer has the
right to stop you if...

569
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,338
That's the important word here.

570
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:10,591
If he has reasonable grounds to believe
a crime is gonna be committed.

571
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,176
Are you absolutely sure about this?

572
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,303
Police harassment, dear,
I could set it to music.

573
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,513
And if he does?

574
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,307
Then he must formally charge you
within 24 hours of that arrest.

575
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,435
But reasonable grounds
means concrete evidence

576
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,061
that can stand up in court.

577
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:24,355
It doesn't mean he doesn't
like the look of you.

578
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,733
That's the same whether you're
standing on a picket line

579
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,694
or trolling down Clapham
High Street in full drag.

580
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,821
Hefina, tell Martin to mind the kids.

581
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,991
- Where you going?
- The police station.

582
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,876
She's finding her feet.

583
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,329
Right, gentlemen, listen to me.

584
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:43,583
A police officer only has the right
to detain a group of people...

585
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,835
You need evidence to
stand up in a court of law.

586
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,671
They need evidence. Detain them
for longer than 24 hours...

587
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,965
There's no proof. No proof.

588
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:54,267
And I will not be leaving
this desk until you do.

589
00:35:57,196 --> 00:36:00,690
We've got all day, so chop-chop.

590
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,977
Nobody said anything
about hiding who we are.

591
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,271
Yes, they did. You.

592
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,857
I just think if everybody
takes it easy on the...

593
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,108
Flamboyance.

594
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,693
We're more likely to fit in.

595
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:13,321
I'm sorry, just to be clear,
when you say "flamboyance,"

596
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,572
you mean "gay."

597
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,365
And when you say "everyone,"
you mean me.

598
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,867
- Jonathan.
- Good.

599
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:21,537
It's just I haven't spoken
1950s in quite a while.

600
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,353
Over here, please.
We're packing parcels.

601
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:43,518
- You'll stay for a pint?
- No, you're all right, Cliff.

602
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,444
Welfare's had a change of
atmosphere, if you know what I mean.

603
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,356
I don't know what you mean, Lee, no.

604
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,108
He means these faggots.

605
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,777
If it wasn't for those people,
you would still be in the nick.

606
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,028
- What?
- He's right.

607
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,822
They make me sick. That's all I know.

608
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,115
That's enough.

609
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,457
Physically sick!

610
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,122
- Gays?
- From London.

611
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,623
They were the ones, got you out.

612
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:06,958
I thought Sian got us out.

613
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,802
They told her.
They told her what to say.

614
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,925
- Carl.
- It's you lot, is it?

615
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,885
- The gays?
- What's going on?

616
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,769
No, it's all right. It's all right.

617
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:23,349
We're LGSM. Lesbians and Gays
Support the Miners, yes.

618
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,942
My name's Mark Ashton.

619
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,530
You'll have a pint, will you, Mark?

620
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:45,997
What I was told about
lesbians really did shock me.

621
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,124
It can't be true, can it?

622
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,925
You're all vegetarians?

623
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:55,096
Actually, Zoe and I are both vegans.

624
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:03,848
So you live together like,
you know, husband and wife,

625
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:07,185
- but what I want to know is...
- I know what you're gonna say.

626
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,944
Which one does the housework?

627
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,648
Oh, okay, well, that's...

628
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,734
That's not what I thought
you was gonna say.

629
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,903
- Are you joking?
- Certainly not.

630
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,989
It's embarrassing enough they spent
one night on Dai's floor, Maureen.

631
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,867
From here on in, the hosting
committee's gonna start hosting.

632
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,577
I'm sorry, not me.

633
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,537
I'm concerned about AIDS.

634
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,080
What?

635
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,333
It's not a trivial matter, Sian.

636
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,709
They've issued leaflets.

637
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,628
I don't mind taking more, Hefina.

638
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,380
Not the lesbians so much,
because of their cuisine,

639
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,306
but I'll take an extra gay.

640
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:41,219
I'll tell you something right now,
Maureen Barry.

641
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,555
If you get AIDS, so help me God,
I'll nurse you myself.

642
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,225
Though how you're gonna get AIDS
from a couple of sleeping bags

643
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,018
in your extension, I don't know.

644
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,353
Listen, it's fine.

645
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,571
No. I can take another one,
and so can Cliff.

646
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,740
Think it's gonna be that easy, do you?

647
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,826
You just bulldoze the whole village
into thinking the same thing as you.

648
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,411
I don't need to bulldoze anyone.

649
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,913
It's you who's got the problem.

650
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:12,423
They're all in there getting
along perfectly well.

651
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,388
Oh, really?

652
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,030
What the hell do you think you're doing?

653
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,652
- Just talking to Kev about something.
- Talk to Kev any day of the week.

654
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,946
Get over there and find a
gay or a lesbian right now.

655
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,448
Look, Hefina, I've shaken their hands,

656
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,368
I've bought them a pint. See?
I don't wanna labor the point, do I?

657
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:50,413
I might, you know, give them
the wrong impression.

658
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,664
- Right.
- Oh, right.

659
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,750
Because you're so bloody irresistible,
is that it, Carl Evans?

660
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,421
Listen to me, I've seen you dancing
round my backyard with no clothes on

661
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,880
since you were this high,

662
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,800
and I can tell you right now,
these gays have thrown better away.

663
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,435
Now move yourself, and you.

664
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,275
This is a first, this.

665
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,819
Men on the dance floor.

666
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,821
You can't be serious.

667
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,824
Welsh men don't dance, do they, Sian?

668
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,208
Never. Can't move their hips.

669
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,838
Well, why don't we show
them what they're missing.

670
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:14,671
Oh, my God, he's amazing.

671
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,930
Come on. Come on.

672
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,145
Oh, look at that.

673
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:42,133
God, I miss disco.

674
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,804
Everyone back to mine for a nightcap.

675
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,640
What? Go to bed, Cliff.

676
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,058
I promise I'll do it, man.

677
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,644
For God's sakes.
He always gets like this.

678
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,439
What did I bloody say to you?

679
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,948
Showing us up in front of our guest?

680
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,110
Don't worry. You're gonna love it.

681
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,077
Cheers, mate.

682
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:13,574
- Oi. What was that about?
- He's gonna give him dance lessons.

683
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:16,285
You joking? He was all
prancing about like that.

684
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:19,914
Listen, if you're gonna spend the
rest of your life standing at the bar

685
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,583
wishing you could speak to
Debbie Thomas, that's fine by me.

686
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,752
I'm gonna be a woman magnet.

687
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,921
Where the bloody hell did you get that?

688
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,807
I don't know why you're so het up.
They're going in the morning.

689
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:40,851
Well, this strike matters
to you two, does it?

690
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,269
Of course it does.

691
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:45,898
What do you think people will
say when they hear about this?

692
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:49,283
We're being backed up by perverts.

693
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,987
You want people taking the piss, do you?

694
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:57,034
Scabs, coppers,
calling us all sorts of names?

695
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,751
No.

696
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,170
Well, I know one thing.

697
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:05,383
Your father would never
have stood for it.

698
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,717
That went well, considering.

699
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,469
"Considering"?

700
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:18,889
Sometimes people can surprise you,
that's all I'm saying.

701
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,975
I never had a problem with it, Sian.

702
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:25,236
Well, I'm glad to hear it,
because this is Joe

703
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:29,240
and he's gonna be sleeping in our house.

704
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,485
How do?

705
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,703
Nice to meet you.

706
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,491
No need to do the full
Barry White, Martin.

707
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:40,042
He knows you're heterosexual.

708
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,141
This is fine.

709
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,681
- We should take him to the door.
- No, just here, please.

710
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:01,932
Just drop me here.

711
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,684
- Come on.
- What about that?

712
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:07,778
- All right. Oh, leave him alone.
- Hang on a minute.

713
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:15,912
- What is it?
- Gotta keep up the fiction.

714
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:22,168
See you.

715
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:30,885
Was it fun?

716
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:34,972
It was the best experience
of my entire life.

717
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:37,600
Making pastry?

718
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:13,462
You wanna start something,
you start it with me!

719
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,589
Lesbians and gays support the miners.

720
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,014
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

721
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,610
Keep it moving, girls. Just put it in.

722
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:36,325
Victory to the miners!

723
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,459
Lesbians and gays support the miners.

724
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,760
Any donations, sir?

725
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:00,718
Don't worry about me freezing
to death in Brixton, will you?

726
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,344
Aren't you going to ring your mom?

727
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:04,638
What for? A long-distance queer bashing?

728
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,724
- Hi.
- Here you are, love.

729
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:09,685
Why don't I pretend to be your girlfriend?
That way, you get an alibi

730
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,395
and I get to watch The Sound of Music.

731
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,355
- Come to ours, Steph.
- Can I?

732
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:16,066
Yeah. Orphans of the storm.

733
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,735
No queen's speech, no carols.

734
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,570
Oh, sounds like heaven.

735
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,871
Support the miners.

736
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:25,200
Very happy Christmas to you too.

737
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:29,413
There is now a danger that has
become a threat to us all.

738
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:33,591
It is a deadly disease and
there is no known cure.

739
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,711
The virus can be passed

740
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:38,630
during sexual intercourse
with an infected person.

741
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:43,559
AIDS. Anally injected death sentence.

742
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,472
Will you switch that off, please, Tony?

743
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,314
But it's spreading.

744
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:50,851
- Thank you.
- So protect yourself.

745
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:55,689
Hello?

746
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:56,899
Can I speak to Jonathan?

747
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:59,026
No, he's being creative in the kitchen,

748
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:01,445
- I'm afraid.
- Take a message.

749
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,655
I just wanted to thank him
for his beautiful card.

750
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,289
Homemade too.

751
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,793
My husband was particularly
impressed with it.

752
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:10,878
I'll tell him.

753
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:13,832
Is that a Welsh accent I can hear?

754
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,002
Maybe. The remnants.

755
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:20,714
I haven't been home
in a long time, so...

756
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:23,467
We're looking forward to seeing
them all back here soon.

757
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,720
And wish Jonathan a happy Christmas
from all of us in Dulais, will you?

758
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,347
Of course. Of course I will.

759
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,147
Nadolig Llawen to you, my love.

760
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:45,496
The One O'Clock News from the BBC.

761
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,450
The Coal Board called a press conference

762
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:51,787
in near despair today after the
collapse of last night's talks

763
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,456
and the strike entered its 42nd week.

764
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:57,084
The union responded
with a renewed attack

765
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:00,838
on the government's cuts to benefits
for the families of those on strike.

766
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,215
They're calling it an
attempt by Mrs. Thatcher

767
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:06,218
to starve the miners back to work.

768
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:09,311
Severe weather in England
and Wales is set to continue...

769
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:12,398
Bloody hell, it's bricked up.

770
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,319
Oh, Jesus.

771
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:37,249
Let's get the stuff unloaded

772
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:40,217
and share it out as
fast as possible, yeah?

773
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:46,300
What the bloody hell am I doing?

774
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,392
Right, come on, then. You heard him.

775
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,139
There's noises in the village.

776
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,974
Small voices.

777
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,976
Nothing we can't handle, but...

778
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,318
They wanna go back?

779
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:01,530
They've been told they'll save
the pits that go back first.

780
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,824
They won't,

781
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:07,286
but desperate people,
they'll believe anything.

782
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:10,289
Tell him about the bus.

783
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,243
Our bus has broken down.

784
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,878
And our gas has been cut off,

785
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:19,256
so we're having baths next door.

786
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:24,887
We're playing for a tin of beef now.

787
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:27,966
Remember, all your proceeds

788
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:31,303
to the strike fund, ladies and gents.
So please dig deep.

789
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:34,348
There's a pair for you. Happy Christmas.

790
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,099
There you go.

791
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,143
Not even Kim Wilde's got them in orange.

792
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:42,648
- This is Gethin.
- Hello.

793
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,900
- He's a little nervous.
- Jonathan.

794
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,027
There's no need to be nervous, boy.

795
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:50,454
- With a good Welsh name like that?
- Where you from, then?

796
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:53,540
Rhyl, originally.

797
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,293
No. No way.

798
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:58,622
Listen here, see.

799
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,249
We don't mind the gays and
the lesbians, that's fine.

800
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:04,385
But don't you dare be bringing
people from North Wales down here.

801
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:16,772
Stupid bugger.

802
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,984
Come on.

803
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:23,730
That bus is a lifeline.
It takes the men to the picket.

804
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:26,608
It takes the food parcels to the
remotest villages. Without it...

805
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:30,821
All the fours, 44.

806
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,031
We need to start thinking
in larger chunks of money.

807
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:35,075
Without it they're gonna fail.
Simple as that.

808
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:37,911
But when are you gonna address
my question about a women's group?

809
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,663
Blind 70.

810
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,540
Stella, this is important.

811
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,293
I know, but this group has
absolutely no democratic process.

812
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:46,795
What do you need a group for?

813
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:50,007
- Lady and me, 23.
- To address the women's issues.

814
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,384
Singly and in a safe environment.

815
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,761
What is unsafe about this environment?

816
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,596
Kelly's eye, number one.

817
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:57,848
I'm a woman, Mike.

818
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,600
Okay? I'm also a lesbian

819
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,811
- and a feminist.
- Listen, love.

820
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:05,188
I don't care if you're Arthur Scargill.

821
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:08,275
Don't talk during the bingo.

822
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,117
Tickety-boo,

823
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,778
62.

824
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,216
Thirty six.

825
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,963
For God's sake, leave him alone.
He's not a Girl's World.

826
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,347
But we love him, Mom.

827
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:35,135
Okay, design speed.

828
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,853
It's called the Great Atlantic Fault.

829
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:42,642
And it starts here in Spain,

830
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:45,152
and then it goes under
the Bay of Biscay,

831
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,981
and then it comes up in South Wales.

832
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:50,650
And then it goes under the Atlantic

833
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,611
for miles and miles and miles,

834
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:56,239
and it comes up again in Pennsylvania.

835
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,949
My father used to talk about it.

836
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,284
- Yeah.
- And mine.

837
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:03,330
- The dark artery.
- That's it. Yeah, that's it.

838
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,798
And you could take a miner

839
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:08,668
from Wales or Spain,

840
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,670
or America, and you could
show them that seam,

841
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,756
and they would recognize it.

842
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,508
There's no other coal like it.

843
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:15,967
It's perfect.

844
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:18,060
Pure.

845
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,021
Yeah.

846
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:25,018
I lost my younger brother to that pit.

847
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:26,436
Thirty-six years old.

848
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:30,232
But without it,
these villages are nothing.

849
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,234
They're finished.

850
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,111
That's what I'd say,

851
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:39,282
if I ever came face to face
with Margaret fucking Thatcher.

852
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,834
That's what I'd tell her.

853
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:45,629
The pit and the people
are one and the same.

854
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:49,800
Yeah.

855
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,379
Well...

856
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:57,134
Welcome home, son.

857
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,642
Thank you.

858
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:18,572
Listen to me, everyone!

859
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:22,082
- I just wanna say something. I...
- Get your feet off those seats.

860
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:25,412
We've let you down.

861
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:28,206
No, we have. We haven't
collected enough,

862
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:31,168
we haven't raised enough awareness.
We know that.

863
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,712
Now, it's not enough to
always be defending.

864
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:37,132
Sometimes you have to
attack to push forward,

865
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:38,974
and that's exactly what we're gonna do.

866
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:42,512
When we get back to London,
and you have my word on this,

867
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:43,854
we are gonna...

868
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:47,399
We're gonna do something so spectacular.

869
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,978
And it will be so incredible,

870
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:52,272
so effective, that the
National Coal Board...

871
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,857
I promise you this.

872
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,825
...will come crawling on
their hands and knees,

873
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,786
in full drag,

874
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:04,367
to beg you for forgiveness.

875
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:05,869
Now, victory!

876
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,621
Victory to the miners!

877
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,173
Well done!

878
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,844
Victory to the miners.

879
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:21,509
As we come marching, marching

880
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:25,931
In the beauty of the day

881
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:30,602
A million darkened kitchens

882
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:35,148
A thousand mill lofts gray

883
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:39,945
Are touched with all the radiance

884
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:43,782
That a sudden sun discloses

885
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:46,618
For the people hear us singin'

886
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:53,298
Bread and roses, bread and roses

887
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:58,380
As we go marching, marching

888
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,300
We battle too for men

889
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,971
For they are women's children

890
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:10,141
And we mother them again

891
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:14,062
Our lives shall not be sweated

892
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:17,857
From birth until life closes

893
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:21,695
Hearts starve as well as bodies

894
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:29,001
Give us bread, but give us roses

895
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:37,585
As we go marching, marching

896
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:41,298
Unnumbered women dead

897
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:45,719
Go crying through our singing

898
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:49,306
Their ancient cry for bread

899
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:53,143
Small art and love and beauty

900
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:57,981
Their drudging spirits knew

901
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,775
Yes, it is bread we fight for

902
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:05,280
But we cry for roses too

903
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:09,082
Go back to where you came from!

904
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:11,710
No! What...?

905
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:19,586
- We've come to take back our welfare.
- What are you talking about?

906
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:22,130
- From all your bloody queers.
- What the hell's going on?

907
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,924
There's normal people who
wanna drink in here as well.

908
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:27,469
You listen to me, those people
in there are our guests.

909
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,637
Yeah? Well, they wanna watch themselves!

910
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:32,766
Leave it, Martin. Come on,
for God's sake, man. Come on, leave it.

911
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,059
Come on, Martin.

912
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,520
You so much as lay one finger
on anyone inside that hall,

913
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:41,316
and so help me God, I'll break
your bloody arms and legs for you.

914
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,283
Come on, come back in. Come on.

915
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:49,873
Bent bastards!

916
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:54,996
There you go. I know it's freezing,
but at least the beers will be cold.

917
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:56,247
Anyone want a beer? Anyone?

918
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:58,840
- Yeah, over here.
- I've got one. Thanks, mate.

919
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,835
Here you go, Alan.

920
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:03,755
Say not the struggle naught availeth

921
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:06,299
The labor and the wounds are vain

922
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:08,426
The enemy faints not, nor faileth

923
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:11,805
And as things have been they remain

924
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,640
If hopes were dupes...

925
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,101
Oh, that's more like it.

926
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:35,460
I'm Gary.

927
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:37,455
Hi.

928
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,589
I want to learn to dance.

929
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:45,672
- We need to make something happen.
- Yeah, well, we do now, yeah.

930
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,799
Something big, an event,

931
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:51,143
something bigger than
we've ever tried before.

932
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:54,639
- Come inside. It's warmer in there.
- It's morale.

933
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,975
That's the thing.
It's just as important as money.

934
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,685
We need to keep them up, Mike.

935
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,812
The minute they start to
feel like a lost cause...

936
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:03,780
I know, I know.

937
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:16,793
And there's nothing worse
than a lost cause.

938
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,507
I'm in Wales,

939
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:32,802
and I don't have to pretend
to be something that I'm not.

940
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,429
I'm home.

941
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:35,763
And I'm gay.

942
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:37,891
- I'm Welsh.
- That's right.

943
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:42,103
Get him another beer
before he starts singing.

944
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:47,449
What I don't understand is why
you never came back before.

945
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:52,204
My mother.

946
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:59,245
- She couldn't accept me.
- Not then, perhaps.

947
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:01,588
She's religious.

948
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:04,626
She hasn't said one
word to me in 16 years.

949
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:08,136
And what about you?
What words have you said to her?

950
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,356
You got a sweetheart, have you, love?

951
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,192
I'm a gobby Northern lesbian, Gwen.
I tend to scare them off.

952
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,619
Look.

953
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:35,281
That's my William.

954
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:37,909
Forty-four years I had him with me.

955
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:41,079
And I wish you as many
with someone one day.

956
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:43,588
And as happy.

957
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:46,709
Jesus, I'm pissed.

958
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,718
Alan, no!

959
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,465
Give us a hand, will you, Steph?
He's thrown up again.

960
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:54,133
Margaret, I am so sorry.

961
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:58,270
Alan Pritchard, so help me.

962
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:02,475
"For many years now,
we have been force-fed an agenda

963
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:07,021
that has represented homosexuals
first as victims, now as heroes."

964
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:09,607
Margaret Donovan could be reported.

965
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:11,442
All those people in her house.

966
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:15,530
"The homosexuals have been told
that it is us, the normal population,

967
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,657
and not them, that is out of step.

968
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:20,660
Any society that accepts
that sick deception

969
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,747
is swirling headlong into a
cesspool of its own making."

970
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,749
Well, they wanna see
what's going on up here.

971
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:28,710
They'd have a field day.

972
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,271
Why don't you come over to Dai's?

973
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:43,433
Just for a minute.

974
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,727
I think if you met one or two of them...

975
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:48,146
Have you seen this, Cliff?
About the gays?

976
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:50,064
I don't believe what
they say about us, Lee.

977
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,816
Why listen to what they say about them?

978
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:55,368
Get inside, you, and shut up.

979
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:59,157
You're a respected woman, Maureen.

980
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:03,043
People follow you.
You could set an example.

981
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:06,748
You're the backbone of that committee.
You work hard.

982
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,876
You've been both mother
and father to those boys.

983
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:12,837
Sitting on your own
in the dark, Maureen?

984
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:16,431
You wanna take that rod
out of your ass for a minute.

985
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:06,064
Good luck.

986
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,487
Morning.

987
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:14,698
Thanks.

988
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:44,769
Hello.

989
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:48,314
I'm in a phone box,
so I'll have to be quick.

990
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:51,943
I got a story for your news desk.

991
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:34,235
Hello, Mum.

992
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:52,295
See you.

993
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,659
Hello, sailors.

994
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:33,336
Morning, ladies.

995
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:36,290
Come on, Maries.

996
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:39,509
- What are they on about?
- With your bum chum.

997
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:41,420
What's going on?

998
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,847
Wait till you see this.

999
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,101
Jesus.

1000
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:50,805
"Perverts support the pits.

1001
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:54,600
A gaggle of gays and
lesbians has come out

1002
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,186
in favor of the miners' strike.

1003
01:05:57,286 --> 01:06:00,940
Our editor says, 'We knew
the miners were desperate,

1004
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:04,360
but now we have the final
and compelling evidence

1005
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,611
that they are finished."'

1006
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:09,490
"Does anyone else hear the bottom
of the barrel being scraped?

1007
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:12,660
From where I'm sitting,
the noise is pretty deafening."

1008
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,211
Unbelievable.

1009
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,417
Who did this?

1010
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:20,668
Have to go to a vote,

1011
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:22,712
but I'm warning you,
we can do without trouble.

1012
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,380
This isn't trouble, it's mischief.

1013
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,174
Jesus, man, we've had worse
than this before now.

1014
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:29,218
Every day they're out collecting for us.

1015
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:30,678
It's the men, Dai.

1016
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:34,390
They've already got their wives
supporting them, and now this, gays.

1017
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:36,225
The whole country laughing at us.

1018
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,436
It's about dignity.

1019
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:40,987
It'll have to go to a vote.

1020
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:45,909
Right. They're calling
an emergency meeting.

1021
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:47,612
A vote.

1022
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:50,573
Dai is speaking up for us, of course,
but it's done a lot of damage.

1023
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:53,326
Yeah, but we're not gonna let
a little thing like this break.

1024
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:54,952
- Oh, down.
- Oh, down.

1025
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:56,996
- Get down.
- Stay down!

1026
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:58,915
Jesus Christ!

1027
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:03,051
Gethin, please!

1028
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:11,844
Bastard!

1029
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:16,974
I don't care about what they do,
but it's a distraction.

1030
01:07:17,074 --> 01:07:19,226
It's distracting people from the strike.

1031
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:20,603
And then there's the children.

1032
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,647
I mean, what example is it for kiddies

1033
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:24,815
to have gays and
lesbians roaming around?

1034
01:07:24,915 --> 01:07:26,067
It's unnatural.

1035
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:29,278
There used to be a tradition in
Wales of honoring your guests.

1036
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:31,948
Do you remember that, ladies?
Respect, generosity?

1037
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:33,866
- Hefina...
- There's one thing unnatural

1038
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:36,751
about this whole bloody business.
Betraying the community.

1039
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:39,330
And when I find out who sold
that story, believe me,

1040
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:42,924
they'll know what it feels
like to be ashamed.

1041
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:49,006
What the hell are we doing?

1042
01:07:49,106 --> 01:07:50,675
Let's just get this finished, Mark.

1043
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:52,301
No, no. What the hell are we doing?

1044
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:54,637
They'd never have known
if it wasn't for this article.

1045
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,305
- So?
- So they'd never have found us.

1046
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:58,057
What are you saying? Send them the bill?

1047
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:00,101
Do you know how many
people read this paper?

1048
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:02,603
This our chance to do
something spectacular.

1049
01:08:02,703 --> 01:08:05,439
We could never drum up this kind
of publicity in a million years.

1050
01:08:05,539 --> 01:08:08,150
Mark, don't you just think we
ought to hold back and regroup?

1051
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,736
There isn't time to regroup.
This is a news item now, today.

1052
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:13,114
- We have to take advantage.
- They called us perverts.

1053
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:16,492
Bromley, it's time for an
important part of your education.

1054
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:19,794
Hands up, in this room, if you've
ever been called a name like that.

1055
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:25,084
Now, there is a long and honorable
tradition in the gay community,

1056
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:28,254
and it has stood us in good
stead for a very long time.

1057
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,840
When somebody calls you a name...
Am I right, Jonathan?

1058
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:34,892
- Dead right.
- You take it and you own it.

1059
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:45,528
- I love you.
- You owe me.

1060
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:53,362
It's a fundraising concert,
and we're looking for bands to...

1061
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:57,116
No. No. No, I am in no way
suggesting that Sting

1062
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:59,542
or indeed any other member
of The Police is a pervert.

1063
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:04,005
Cool. Cheers.

1064
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:09,587
Oh, I can probably get you some more.
Next week, if you want.

1065
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:11,554
He'll call.

1066
01:09:12,064 --> 01:09:13,806
Okay.

1067
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:28,939
There are no gay artists
on this label. I'm sorry.

1068
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:30,900
They don't have to be gay.
That's the point.

1069
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,319
This is a coming together
of all different people...

1070
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,247
Reception.

1071
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:42,794
It arrived about 10 minutes ago, Barry.

1072
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:46,839
Yeah, well, you could
come down and get it.

1073
01:09:47,766 --> 01:09:50,044
What the bloody hell do
you think you're doing?

1074
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:52,512
That's the number for Gay Switchboard.

1075
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:56,474
You never know.
One of them might need it one day.

1076
01:09:56,817 --> 01:09:58,469
We'll be back in time for the vote.

1077
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:00,513
- Right-o.
- Any problems, we can be reached

1078
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,765
- at the bookshop.
- You're gonna miss this train.

1079
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:05,434
Rowena Roberts has had a baby.
She needs an extra box.

1080
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:07,144
I can't hear you.

1081
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:08,938
- Rowena Roberts had a baby...
- Strange.

1082
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:10,606
I can't... I can't hear you.

1083
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:13,574
She needs an extra box.

1084
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,174
And the difference is,
this is open to everyone, okay?

1085
01:10:37,274 --> 01:10:39,051
Gay, straight, it doesn't matter.

1086
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:41,387
We want people to come together
to show their support.

1087
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,848
And why should gay people
like me support the miners?

1088
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:45,349
Because miners dig for coal,

1089
01:10:45,449 --> 01:10:48,144
which produces power,
which allows gay people like you

1090
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,729
to dance to Bananarama
until 3:00 in the morning.

1091
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:52,071
Next question?

1092
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,950
Are you all right?

1093
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:58,286
Yes, you, the cute one.

1094
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:01,448
I've never met a pop star.

1095
01:11:01,548 --> 01:11:03,367
I have. Max Boyce.

1096
01:11:03,467 --> 01:11:05,786
He was playing Swansea Grand
the year our Jane was born.

1097
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:07,371
What's funny about that?

1098
01:11:07,471 --> 01:11:11,083
You need to push the T-shirts and
the badges as hard as you can.

1099
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:15,428
This is a fundraiser.
Make sure people are buying stuff.

1100
01:11:17,147 --> 01:11:20,016
- Is he in charge?
- He's the official photographer.

1101
01:11:26,156 --> 01:11:29,185
We don't want it to be all churchy.
Do you know what I mean?

1102
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:30,978
It's a christening.

1103
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:34,398
Yeah, but the readings don't all have
to come from the Bible, do they?

1104
01:11:34,498 --> 01:11:36,859
You can have all sorts
of things nowadays.

1105
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,368
It's more open.

1106
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,242
Meeting's tomorrow afternoon,
3:00 sharp.

1107
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:46,911
We'll make it, long as we leave early.

1108
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:49,205
- And the vote?
- At the end.

1109
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,957
Single question: can we
continue taking your support

1110
01:11:52,057 --> 01:11:53,375
in the light of recent events?

1111
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:55,961
- Recent events.
- Won't have anything to worry about.

1112
01:11:56,061 --> 01:11:58,422
I'm telling you, when they see
what you make out of this...

1113
01:11:58,522 --> 01:12:02,301
- If we make anything out of it.
- You joking? You're already famous.

1114
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:04,352
Give it here.

1115
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,765
"Bronski Beat are to headline
a benefit for the miners

1116
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:09,016
at the Electric Ballroom.

1117
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:12,561
Pits and Perverts is being organized

1118
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:14,688
by the London Lesbians and Gay Men

1119
01:12:14,788 --> 01:12:17,107
- Support the Miners group."
- Got the name wrong.

1120
01:12:17,207 --> 01:12:19,568
"The event is open to everyone,
gay or straight,

1121
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:21,744
and will be a real festive occasion

1122
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:25,866
through which we can express our
solidarity with the mining community."

1123
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:44,426
Don't dawdle, love. Get indoors.

1124
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:46,679
Support the miners.

1125
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:59,316
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

1126
01:12:59,416 --> 01:13:00,693
To the gays,

1127
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:03,737
to the straights,

1128
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:08,284
and to the as yet undecided.

1129
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:14,832
- Welcome to the Electric Ballroom,
- It's amazing.

1130
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:16,333
for this,

1131
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:21,880
the first ever Pits and
Perverts Benefit Ball.

1132
01:13:25,275 --> 01:13:28,311
Tell me why

1133
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:34,317
Tell me why

1134
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:48,748
Contempt in your eyes
As I turn to kiss his lips

1135
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:51,618
Broken, I lie

1136
01:13:51,718 --> 01:13:53,203
All my feelings denied

1137
01:13:53,303 --> 01:13:55,296
Blood on your fist

1138
01:13:56,974 --> 01:14:09,178
Can you tell me why?

1139
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,347
This is the first gay club
we've ever been to.

1140
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:14,357
Yeah? As a matter of fact,
we're not gay, either.

1141
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:17,735
We're miners.

1142
01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:27,571
- That's perfect.
- Hide me.

1143
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:30,790
Hey. Why?

1144
01:14:31,675 --> 01:14:36,087
If you see Steph,
perhaps you'd give her this?

1145
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:41,168
They want me to join their breakaway
group, Lesbians Against Pit Closures.

1146
01:14:41,268 --> 01:14:42,461
Strictly women only.

1147
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:45,304
Don't think I could
trust myself, do you?

1148
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:52,429
Are you gonna take my picture, then?

1149
01:14:52,529 --> 01:14:55,474
Tell me why

1150
01:14:55,574 --> 01:15:07,111
Can you tell me why?

1151
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:14,701
Well, it's incredible to see such
a mix of people here tonight.

1152
01:15:14,801 --> 01:15:17,253
Gay and straight.

1153
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:20,506
Can you see what we've done here?

1154
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:25,629
By coming together, all of us,
by pledging our solidarity,

1155
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:29,425
our friendship, we've made history.

1156
01:15:44,289 --> 01:15:46,490
Back in our...

1157
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:53,122
Back in our miners' lodge in Wales,
we have a banner.

1158
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:58,210
And it's old. It's very old,
maybe a hundred years.

1159
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:00,588
And it's this,

1160
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:03,340
two hands together,

1161
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:06,469
joined like this.

1162
01:16:07,437 --> 01:16:11,925
Well, I tell you now,
you've worn our badge,

1163
01:16:12,025 --> 01:16:14,435
"Coal not dole,"

1164
01:16:14,778 --> 01:16:19,349
and when the time comes,
you have my word on this,

1165
01:16:19,449 --> 01:16:21,393
we will wear yours.

1166
01:16:21,493 --> 01:16:24,271
Shoulder-to-shoulder, hand-to-hand.

1167
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:32,779
Come on. We're off out for the night.

1168
01:16:32,879 --> 01:16:35,240
Now, I hope you ladies
aren't gonna let me down.

1169
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:38,702
What? We want to see
everything, don't we?

1170
01:16:38,802 --> 01:16:41,288
- What, everything?
- Even the rubber scene.

1171
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:13,320
Sorry, ladies, this is a men-only venue.

1172
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:15,864
Oh, don't be daft, love.
We've come all the way from Powys.

1173
01:17:19,384 --> 01:17:21,078
Evening.

1174
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:22,454
Hello.

1175
01:17:26,224 --> 01:17:28,919
That's my youngest, yeah.

1176
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,894
How'd you get into that leotard, then?

1177
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:40,896
Talcum powder.

1178
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:42,724
What?

1179
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:45,978
- Talcum powder.
- Oh.

1180
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:48,696
Lily of the valley, I use.

1181
01:17:54,586 --> 01:17:56,495
Mark?

1182
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:59,366
Oh, my God. Mark Ashton.

1183
01:17:59,466 --> 01:18:00,617
Tim?

1184
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:02,327
- I know. I know.
- Oh, my God.

1185
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:05,205
Oh, this is insane.

1186
01:18:05,305 --> 01:18:07,124
I'm bumping into everybody tonight.

1187
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:09,174
How are you?

1188
01:18:11,603 --> 01:18:13,345
Still changing the world?

1189
01:18:14,314 --> 01:18:16,098
- Bit by bit.
- Tim, come on.

1190
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:18,885
I haven't been home in four days.

1191
01:18:18,985 --> 01:18:20,477
Haven't you?

1192
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:22,938
I'm on a farewell tour.

1193
01:18:23,407 --> 01:18:25,024
Where are you going?

1194
01:18:37,087 --> 01:18:40,748
You are a beautiful man, Mark.

1195
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:44,376
I miss you.

1196
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:48,624
Please take care of yourself, okay?

1197
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:49,916
Please.

1198
01:18:50,016 --> 01:18:52,593
- Come on.
- Please take care.

1199
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:04,431
Come on then, girls.
That's enough. Back to ours.

1200
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:06,440
Bedtime.

1201
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:09,061
- Come on.
- I'm sorry.

1202
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:12,481
Don't worry, you're lighter
than your husband.

1203
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:16,276
Do you know what I was when I met Alan?

1204
01:19:16,376 --> 01:19:18,243
Drunk?

1205
01:19:18,503 --> 01:19:20,996
Sixteen.

1206
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:24,041
Think that's ridiculous?

1207
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:26,745
I was pretty then.

1208
01:19:26,845 --> 01:19:29,213
You're pretty now.

1209
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:32,626
All goes south, doesn't it?

1210
01:19:32,726 --> 01:19:36,088
Love, looks, everything.

1211
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:38,090
That's cheery.

1212
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:39,716
Sod it.

1213
01:19:39,816 --> 01:19:42,135
I always thought sex was
for the men, really.

1214
01:19:42,235 --> 01:19:44,137
Anyway, we just put
up with it, don't we?

1215
01:19:44,237 --> 01:19:46,890
- Keep them quiet.
- Okay.

1216
01:19:46,990 --> 01:19:49,768
I will listen to a certain amount
of drunken bollocks, Gail,

1217
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:52,062
but sex is not just for the men.

1218
01:19:52,162 --> 01:19:55,072
It's for the women too, believe me.

1219
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:08,002
Oh, yeah.

1220
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,509
No carpets.

1221
01:20:22,609 --> 01:20:24,469
This is Laura Ashley.

1222
01:20:24,569 --> 01:20:25,978
I've seen it before.

1223
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:28,140
Where?

1224
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:31,025
- Cardiff.
- What I want to know

1225
01:20:31,952 --> 01:20:33,228
is what's this?

1226
01:20:35,705 --> 01:20:37,816
Hefina, put that back immediately.

1227
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:40,485
That's nothing. Here,
look what else I've found.

1228
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:42,738
You never went under his bed!

1229
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:48,034
When was the last time

1230
01:20:48,134 --> 01:20:51,420
you saw anything like that?
When? When?

1231
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:59,087
Don't those women ever sleep?

1232
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:06,178
Oh, Jesus, God.

1233
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:08,021
That takes me back.

1234
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,309
No, look. Wait, look. Look...

1235
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:14,818
Put it down.

1236
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:57,194
Mum.

1237
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:22,504
So, what were their names again, boys?

1238
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:23,755
Mine was Jess.

1239
01:22:23,855 --> 01:22:26,758
- And mine was Carol.
- Hey.

1240
01:22:26,858 --> 01:22:28,767
Straight people asked
if they could join.

1241
01:22:29,152 --> 01:22:31,429
- You're joking.
- We should set up another group.

1242
01:22:31,529 --> 01:22:34,432
Straights Supporting
Gays Supporting Miners.

1243
01:22:34,532 --> 01:22:36,441
- This is right...
- That's it, yeah...

1244
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:40,237
Excuse me.

1245
01:22:42,248 --> 01:22:43,441
That's it, we're off.

1246
01:22:43,541 --> 01:22:45,110
- What about Bromley?
- It's too late.

1247
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:48,321
- You've got a meeting to get to.
- The vote, remember?

1248
01:22:48,421 --> 01:22:50,073
Okay.

1249
01:22:50,173 --> 01:22:52,826
- Surely you've got his number, Steph.
- Nobody's got his number.

1250
01:22:52,926 --> 01:22:56,246
- He still lives at home.
- Mark's right. If we're gonna get...

1251
01:22:56,346 --> 01:22:58,665
- He's blown it. Come on, let's go.
- Oh, what a shame.

1252
01:22:58,765 --> 01:23:00,792
He was sucking face when
the lights came up.

1253
01:23:00,892 --> 01:23:03,044
I wouldn't waste any time
feeling sorry for him.

1254
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:06,138
Can I please have an aspirin?

1255
01:23:43,893 --> 01:23:45,378
What the hell is this?

1256
01:23:45,478 --> 01:23:49,056
Plans change, Cliff. It's not my fault.

1257
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:51,051
No answer.

1258
01:23:51,151 --> 01:23:54,186
- They must be on their way.
- Okay.

1259
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:57,766
I can't speak in front of
all these people, Cliff.

1260
01:23:57,866 --> 01:23:59,733
I can't.

1261
01:24:09,252 --> 01:24:11,154
I know you think you
know what you want, Joe,

1262
01:24:11,254 --> 01:24:13,538
but you're so young.

1263
01:24:14,924 --> 01:24:18,210
That's what the law's for,
to protect you.

1264
01:24:29,647 --> 01:24:33,058
I didn't know who I was at your age.

1265
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:40,023
It's such a terrible life, Joe.

1266
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:44,695
It's lonely.

1267
01:24:45,663 --> 01:24:47,948
Is that what you want?

1268
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:50,450
No family?

1269
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:54,413
Hiding from people at work?
From everyone?

1270
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:57,249
Keeping secrets?

1271
01:25:06,726 --> 01:25:08,468
Come here.

1272
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:14,426
So now Cliff will speak
on behalf of the LGSM.

1273
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:16,518
Floor's yours, Cliff.

1274
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:29,865
Well, what I want to say abo...

1275
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:33,695
About the gays and lesbians...

1276
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:35,280
Why don't you do us a poem, Cliff?

1277
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:42,454
Poem! Poem! Poem!

1278
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:45,999
I want to propose that
this meeting is unlawful.

1279
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:49,502
I want to propose that this meeting
was brought forward unlawfully

1280
01:25:49,602 --> 01:25:53,298
and that most of the people here
aren't even from this village!

1281
01:25:53,398 --> 01:25:56,141
All right. Let's bring
it forward to the vote.

1282
01:26:01,072 --> 01:26:02,773
There we go.

1283
01:26:03,116 --> 01:26:04,642
Two hours to spare.

1284
01:26:04,742 --> 01:26:06,061
Hefina Heddon,

1285
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:08,938
you drive like a bloody lunatic.

1286
01:26:09,038 --> 01:26:10,989
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1287
01:26:11,207 --> 01:26:15,160
- Gwen, look after the gays.
- Right-o!

1288
01:26:22,218 --> 01:26:23,995
- Three o'clock.
- You can't dictate

1289
01:26:24,095 --> 01:26:25,538
when the committee sits.

1290
01:26:25,638 --> 01:26:26,956
You told us 3:00.

1291
01:26:27,056 --> 01:26:30,293
- Had to change it. If you weren't in...
- A bloody disgusting way to behave.

1292
01:26:30,393 --> 01:26:32,545
It's invalid.
This whole decision is invalid.

1293
01:26:32,645 --> 01:26:34,506
- We can fight it.
- We got one fight.

1294
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:36,007
The fucking strike!

1295
01:26:36,107 --> 01:26:37,759
Or have you forgotten that?

1296
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:39,844
Dancing around in London?

1297
01:26:39,944 --> 01:26:41,513
The trouble with those people

1298
01:26:41,613 --> 01:26:43,598
- is they jump on the bandwagon.
- What?

1299
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:46,309
It's well-known. They pretend
they're backing you,

1300
01:26:46,409 --> 01:26:49,354
but what they're really doing
is pushing their own agenda.

1301
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:50,647
Gay rights.

1302
01:26:50,747 --> 01:26:54,067
- What?
- We've seen articles, Hefina.

1303
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:56,569
Christ Jesus, help me.

1304
01:26:56,669 --> 01:26:59,656
You better shut her mouth or
I'm gonna do it permanently.

1305
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:01,282
No, come on then!

1306
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:02,534
That's enough!

1307
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:05,829
- An official letter will be sent.
- I can't...

1308
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:07,497
I can't listen to this.

1309
01:27:07,597 --> 01:27:09,249
To thank them, most sincerely,

1310
01:27:09,349 --> 01:27:13,128
but the vote was we won't be
accepting their support anymore.

1311
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:15,595
They're causing us embarrassment,
Dai. That's the thing.

1312
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:18,341
And we're not strong enough, not now.

1313
01:27:18,441 --> 01:27:20,600
We're struggling to survive as it is.

1314
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:23,186
Oh, that reminds me.

1315
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:31,319
Courtesy of those people
and their agenda.

1316
01:27:33,164 --> 01:27:34,948
Jesus Christ.

1317
01:27:35,541 --> 01:27:37,777
I don't suppose you opened
your mouth, did you?

1318
01:27:37,877 --> 01:27:40,120
Didn't want to rock
the boat, is that it?

1319
01:27:42,131 --> 01:27:45,041
There's bloody thousands here.

1320
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:53,293
You think you've known
someone your whole life.

1321
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:55,587
Turns out they're a complete stranger.

1322
01:27:55,687 --> 01:27:59,132
- I'd say the same about you, Cliff.
- I'll tell you something.

1323
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:02,893
If you think this is what my brother
would've wanted, you're wrong.

1324
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:09,309
We came to help you win, and if
we're not helping, we have to go.

1325
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:11,394
Hey, this was all you.

1326
01:28:11,494 --> 01:28:14,321
- No.
- It was.

1327
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:21,077
All right, take my advice.

1328
01:28:21,671 --> 01:28:24,164
Don't give it all to the fight.

1329
01:28:24,674 --> 01:28:26,958
Save some for home.

1330
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:29,878
There's more to life, you know?

1331
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:34,751
You girls have opened my eyes.

1332
01:28:34,851 --> 01:28:37,712
I'm going to extend my
repertoire, you'll see.

1333
01:28:37,812 --> 01:28:40,347
The vegan Delia Smith.

1334
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:44,928
- Bye.
- Bye.

1335
01:28:45,028 --> 01:28:47,062
Take care now.

1336
01:29:09,886 --> 01:29:12,712
It's a bloody travesty, man.

1337
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:45,863
I don't accept it.

1338
01:29:45,963 --> 01:29:47,407
- Gethin.
- I don't!

1339
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:50,243
They can't stop me from
collecting money, now, can they?

1340
01:29:50,343 --> 01:29:52,294
- Don't be crazy, Gethin.
- Geth.

1341
01:29:53,721 --> 01:29:57,173
Somebody better tell
Lesbians Against Pit Closures.

1342
01:30:00,144 --> 01:30:02,297
- What now?
- What do you mean?

1343
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:04,257
- What we doing? Where we going?
- It's over.

1344
01:30:04,357 --> 01:30:05,675
Were you not paying attention?

1345
01:30:05,775 --> 01:30:09,095
We lost. And I don't know
about you, but I'm pissing off.

1346
01:30:09,195 --> 01:30:11,097
- Where?
- Anywhere. I'm out of here.

1347
01:30:11,197 --> 01:30:12,348
What about the rest of us?

1348
01:30:12,448 --> 01:30:15,935
Think it might be possible just for once
you could make your own decision?

1349
01:30:16,035 --> 01:30:17,895
- You what?
- Do you think that just for once

1350
01:30:17,995 --> 01:30:20,440
you could stop following me
around like a fucking spaniel

1351
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:22,157
and let me have a life of my own?

1352
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:25,611
Yeah.

1353
01:30:25,711 --> 01:30:27,822
- Yeah. I think I could manage that.
- Good.

1354
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:31,249
Piss off, all of you. Leave me alone.

1355
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:45,340
Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners.

1356
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,008
Never mind the miners.

1357
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:48,843
There's gay people dying every day.

1358
01:30:48,943 --> 01:30:51,686
That's what you should
be thinking about.

1359
01:30:51,821 --> 01:30:54,557
Not the bloody miners.

1360
01:30:54,657 --> 01:30:56,775
Asshole.

1361
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:01,613
Excuse me.

1362
01:31:04,333 --> 01:31:06,284
Excuse me.

1363
01:31:07,003 --> 01:31:09,996
Excuse me, I only wanna talk to you.

1364
01:31:18,806 --> 01:31:20,666
Tell you what we'll do,
let's come over here.

1365
01:31:20,766 --> 01:31:23,044
This is the key you swapped it to.

1366
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:25,095
Oh, well, we'll leave
that there, but I'll...

1367
01:31:28,232 --> 01:31:29,766
Is Joe there, please?

1368
01:31:30,193 --> 01:31:31,928
No, I'm afraid he's out.

1369
01:31:32,028 --> 01:31:34,806
Can you tell him that his
friend Gethin's in hospital?

1370
01:31:34,906 --> 01:31:36,432
It's very important. He's...

1371
01:31:36,532 --> 01:31:39,602
He's in St. Thomas' Hospital.
He's been beaten up.

1372
01:31:39,702 --> 01:31:41,020
Yes, of course I'll tell him.

1373
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:44,482
And will you tell him that Steph
called round, to see how he was?

1374
01:31:44,582 --> 01:31:46,032
Yeah.

1375
01:31:48,002 --> 01:31:49,369
Who was that?

1376
01:31:52,048 --> 01:31:54,708
Tina. She wants a lift in the morning.

1377
01:31:55,092 --> 01:31:58,253
You're back at the job center
tomorrow, don't forget.

1378
01:32:04,393 --> 01:32:06,212
I should've...

1379
01:32:06,312 --> 01:32:08,763
I should've said more.

1380
01:32:10,066 --> 01:32:13,476
I could have. I could've spoken better.

1381
01:32:15,154 --> 01:32:17,473
If you're gonna cut, cut it straight.

1382
01:32:17,573 --> 01:32:20,024
Into triangles.

1383
01:32:31,087 --> 01:32:33,204
I'm gay.

1384
01:32:40,054 --> 01:32:41,963
I know.

1385
01:32:44,767 --> 01:32:47,635
I've known for a little
while now, Cliff.

1386
01:32:49,146 --> 01:32:51,806
Since the gays arrived?

1387
01:32:53,025 --> 01:32:55,595
Well, I can't speak for
the rest of the village,

1388
01:32:55,695 --> 01:32:58,639
but speaking for myself,
since about 1968.

1389
01:33:00,283 --> 01:33:02,018
Well...

1390
01:33:04,370 --> 01:33:05,987
Yeah.

1391
01:33:34,567 --> 01:33:36,226
What's that?

1392
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:38,387
It's a new van.

1393
01:33:38,487 --> 01:33:40,396
About time too.

1394
01:33:43,367 --> 01:33:44,602
What the hell's this?

1395
01:33:44,702 --> 01:33:48,231
New van, courtesy of our gay
friends down in London.

1396
01:33:48,331 --> 01:33:50,942
- I'm not getting in that.
- Then you'll have to stay here.

1397
01:33:51,042 --> 01:33:53,785
In you get, lads. Quick now.

1398
01:34:16,609 --> 01:34:18,511
You a lesbian, are you, love?

1399
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:22,730
That's right. We're just off to
Swansea now for a massive lez-off.

1400
01:34:41,634 --> 01:34:44,328
Britain's longest-running
national strike is over.

1401
01:34:44,428 --> 01:34:48,874
Amongst scenes of bitterness and anger,
NUM delegates voted narrowly

1402
01:34:48,974 --> 01:34:51,043
for an organized return
to work on Tuesday.

1403
01:34:51,143 --> 01:34:54,338
Tomorrow, most of Britain's coal
miners will return to work.

1404
01:34:54,438 --> 01:34:56,799
They say they'll march
back heads held high.

1405
01:34:56,899 --> 01:34:59,844
It's almost a year to the very
day since they walked out

1406
01:34:59,944 --> 01:35:01,721
and embarked on a course
of action which...

1407
01:35:01,821 --> 01:35:03,055
Joe!

1408
01:35:03,155 --> 01:35:05,933
Have you seen the news?
Thank God for that!

1409
01:35:06,033 --> 01:35:07,893
The cost, financial and social...

1410
01:35:07,993 --> 01:35:09,395
Joe?

1411
01:35:30,474 --> 01:35:32,216
Good lads, good lads.

1412
01:35:52,288 --> 01:35:54,989
Bloody hell.

1413
01:36:25,112 --> 01:36:28,731
- Mark, where are you going?
- I'm leaving.

1414
01:36:28,949 --> 01:36:32,395
I was trying to make myself
feel better, and I failed.

1415
01:36:32,495 --> 01:36:34,188
I've been virtually under house arrest.

1416
01:36:34,288 --> 01:36:36,482
Stuck with my parents.

1417
01:36:36,582 --> 01:36:38,776
I haven't seen anyone.
Tried ringing Steph, but she...

1418
01:36:38,876 --> 01:36:41,320
- Why don't you leave?
- I did last night.

1419
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:44,490
- I didn't even tell them I was going.
- That's not leaving, it's running.

1420
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:46,784
- What are you gonna do now?
- Stay here.

1421
01:36:46,884 --> 01:36:49,662
And do what?
And get a job down in the pit?

1422
01:36:49,762 --> 01:36:52,540
That's all they need,
a trained pastry chef with a camera.

1423
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:55,084
When are you gonna get some guts, huh?

1424
01:36:55,184 --> 01:36:57,211
You're a member of LGSM,
so stop sneaking out

1425
01:36:57,311 --> 01:36:59,880
of your mommy's house
and stand up for yourself.

1426
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:02,181
Have some pride.

1427
01:37:02,483 --> 01:37:05,435
Because life is short, okay?

1428
01:37:06,362 --> 01:37:08,438
It's short.

1429
01:37:10,282 --> 01:37:11,899
Okay?

1430
01:37:43,941 --> 01:37:47,136
- What should I tell the others?
- Nothing.

1431
01:37:47,236 --> 01:37:49,228
I wasn't here.

1432
01:37:53,075 --> 01:37:54,977
You're a mad bugger.

1433
01:37:55,077 --> 01:37:58,404
I'm taking you home after that.
In the van. No arguments.

1434
01:37:59,123 --> 01:38:01,824
Will you give this to Jeff, please, Joe?

1435
01:38:02,042 --> 01:38:03,284
Of course I will.

1436
01:38:04,253 --> 01:38:05,912
Come on.

1437
01:38:10,926 --> 01:38:13,245
What about Gethin? Is he okay?

1438
01:38:13,345 --> 01:38:14,955
Gethin?

1439
01:38:15,055 --> 01:38:16,923
The last I heard,
he was back on the ward.

1440
01:38:41,498 --> 01:38:43,407
I don't like Meltis Fruits.

1441
01:38:44,543 --> 01:38:47,203
Well, then maybe you won't
go through them quite so fast.

1442
01:38:49,673 --> 01:38:52,416
Oh, help me out with these,
will you, Bromley?

1443
01:38:57,139 --> 01:38:58,965
Stay in bed.

1444
01:39:01,393 --> 01:39:03,420
Keep an eye on Jonathan
for me, will you?

1445
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:05,548
He needs to take care of himself.

1446
01:39:05,648 --> 01:39:07,049
It's you we're taking care of.

1447
01:39:07,149 --> 01:39:09,593
If you could just make sure
he's got some groceries in.

1448
01:39:09,693 --> 01:39:12,895
- Gethin.
- He's HIV positive, Sian.

1449
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:22,530
He not supposed to smoke,
and he needs to eat properly.

1450
01:39:27,419 --> 01:39:29,912
Please, for me.

1451
01:39:32,925 --> 01:39:34,667
Gethin?

1452
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:38,588
Hello.

1453
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:42,466
This is my mum.

1454
01:39:43,018 --> 01:39:45,219
- Hi.
- Come in.

1455
01:39:48,941 --> 01:39:51,093
Back then, when they knew
even less about this thing,

1456
01:39:51,193 --> 01:39:54,353
they gave out numbers
with each diagnosis.

1457
01:39:54,989 --> 01:39:57,857
One, two, three, and so on.

1458
01:39:59,034 --> 01:40:02,278
Of course, when they got
into the high thousands, it...

1459
01:40:12,548 --> 01:40:14,749
I'm number two.

1460
01:40:19,096 --> 01:40:22,006
Nobody knows what's keeping me alive.

1461
01:40:22,307 --> 01:40:24,675
I think it's the grass.

1462
01:40:28,814 --> 01:40:31,098
What are you gonna do now?

1463
01:40:32,192 --> 01:40:34,435
Make you some soup.

1464
01:40:34,862 --> 01:40:36,931
Drive back to Wales.

1465
01:40:37,031 --> 01:40:39,482
No, I mean, with your life.

1466
01:40:41,452 --> 01:40:44,153
I'm a wife and mother, love.

1467
01:40:44,747 --> 01:40:47,615
My life goes back to normal now.

1468
01:40:48,167 --> 01:40:50,409
Well, it shouldn't.

1469
01:40:51,086 --> 01:40:53,822
You have a first-class mind.

1470
01:40:53,922 --> 01:40:57,409
You should do something. Go to college.

1471
01:40:57,509 --> 01:40:59,835
Don't waste it, Sian.

1472
01:41:00,179 --> 01:41:03,791
There are young people
dying every day now.

1473
01:41:03,891 --> 01:41:05,967
Good people.

1474
01:41:06,143 --> 01:41:08,719
Clever, promising.

1475
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:10,763
Don't you dare waste it.

1476
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:19,807
Shit.

1477
01:41:39,551 --> 01:41:41,128
I'm sorry.

1478
01:41:49,186 --> 01:41:52,305
What the hell is this?
And where have you been?

1479
01:41:59,655 --> 01:42:01,140
You must be Joe's mom. I'm Sian.

1480
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:04,442
Will you please remove
your van from my property?

1481
01:42:06,203 --> 01:42:08,105
I hope you appreciate him.

1482
01:42:08,205 --> 01:42:11,907
Because there's a whole village back
in Wales who thinks he's a hero.

1483
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:26,415
- Joe.
- Mum, he's done this on purpose.

1484
01:42:26,515 --> 01:42:28,591
It's all right. I'm leaving.

1485
01:42:29,309 --> 01:42:32,511
I hope one day we can
be friends again, Mum.

1486
01:42:33,397 --> 01:42:35,348
Oi, you got something
to say to your sister?

1487
01:42:35,691 --> 01:42:39,477
I've got something to say to you,
Jason. You're a dick!

1488
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:44,099
And, Tina, that tight perm
doesn't suit you. It never has.

1489
01:42:44,199 --> 01:42:45,900
I'm sorry.

1490
01:42:51,290 --> 01:42:52,990
Joe?

1491
01:42:54,585 --> 01:42:56,369
Joe.

1492
01:43:34,082 --> 01:43:35,908
You all right?

1493
01:43:42,174 --> 01:43:44,041
Cheers.

1494
01:43:44,801 --> 01:43:48,163
While you've been away,
I've been changing my act.

1495
01:43:48,263 --> 01:43:49,665
You watch.

1496
01:43:49,765 --> 01:43:53,585
Demure and accommodating. That's me.

1497
01:43:53,685 --> 01:43:56,588
The lesbian Lady Di.

1498
01:43:59,608 --> 01:44:02,736
I think I'd find that a
tremendous disappointment.

1499
01:44:04,905 --> 01:44:08,983
I'm glad you came back, Bromley.
It wasn't the same without you.

1500
01:44:10,869 --> 01:44:12,653
Thanks.

1501
01:44:18,001 --> 01:44:20,744
I'm glad I came back too.

1502
01:44:22,756 --> 01:44:26,584
If we were normal,
this is when we'd kiss.

1503
01:45:00,502 --> 01:45:03,662
- That's the rest of it.
- Thanks.

1504
01:45:04,631 --> 01:45:06,700
"Screw you, Thatcher" or "fuck you"?

1505
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,036
I can see the appeal of both.

1506
01:45:09,136 --> 01:45:11,788
Jonathan, "screw" or "fuck"?

1507
01:45:11,888 --> 01:45:14,131
"Screw." More visceral.

1508
01:45:15,267 --> 01:45:17,801
Attention, attention:

1509
01:45:19,021 --> 01:45:22,758
We have reason to believe that
there are known homosexualists

1510
01:45:22,858 --> 01:45:25,302
and a confirmed lesbo
inside these premises,

1511
01:45:25,402 --> 01:45:29,605
and that they are armed with
sewing machines and glitter.

1512
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:33,651
Aha.

1513
01:45:34,202 --> 01:45:36,355
Now that you have made
yourselves known to me,

1514
01:45:36,455 --> 01:45:39,358
I have a question for the
notorious Accrington sodomite,

1515
01:45:39,458 --> 01:45:42,194
- known as Mike Jackson.
- Will you please put that down?

1516
01:45:42,294 --> 01:45:44,154
We have good relationship
with our neighbors.

1517
01:45:44,254 --> 01:45:45,788
Mike!

1518
01:45:47,883 --> 01:45:49,667
Mike.

1519
01:45:58,935 --> 01:46:01,887
I behaved like a prick before.

1520
01:46:02,898 --> 01:46:05,057
Do you forgive me?

1521
01:46:06,401 --> 01:46:10,563
Just... Just get up here and
sew something, will you?

1522
01:46:24,169 --> 01:46:26,036
There you go, Bromley.

1523
01:46:27,839 --> 01:46:29,623
Happy birthday.

1524
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:49,602
Thank you.

1525
01:46:51,655 --> 01:46:55,232
Right. Now get to work.

1526
01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:58,068
All right, just for future reference,

1527
01:46:59,955 --> 01:47:03,115
- my name is Joe.
- You tell him, Bromley.

1528
01:47:03,458 --> 01:47:09,489
Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!

1529
01:47:09,589 --> 01:47:15,787
Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!

1530
01:47:15,887 --> 01:47:18,922
- Bromley.
- Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!

1531
01:47:32,654 --> 01:47:35,397
Haven't you heard about
the miners, dearie?

1532
01:47:36,283 --> 01:47:37,893
They lost.

1533
01:47:39,995 --> 01:47:42,356
- Have you heard? No politics.
- What?

1534
01:47:42,456 --> 01:47:44,232
- Mark's with the steward.
- No politics?

1535
01:47:44,332 --> 01:47:47,242
- No slogans.
- We're a Mardi Gras, apparently.

1536
01:47:49,463 --> 01:47:51,031
- A general feeling.
- Amongst who?

1537
01:47:51,131 --> 01:47:53,867
Amongst the committee that people
have become tired of politics,

1538
01:47:53,967 --> 01:47:55,994
and that this year the
tone should be celebratory

1539
01:47:56,094 --> 01:47:58,330
- with affirmative slogans.
- Horseshit.

1540
01:47:58,430 --> 01:48:01,833
If you insist with your banner, you march
at the back with the fringe groups.

1541
01:48:01,933 --> 01:48:04,086
No, mate, we're LGSM.
We fought alongside the miners.

1542
01:48:04,186 --> 01:48:06,088
Congratulations,
but it's time for a party.

1543
01:48:06,188 --> 01:48:08,632
- What? I'm not gonna go at the back.
- Bollocks!

1544
01:48:08,732 --> 01:48:10,008
Complete and utter bollocks!

1545
01:48:10,108 --> 01:48:12,677
- What's LGSM's position?
- We're going to march.

1546
01:48:12,777 --> 01:48:14,304
Yes, but with banners or without?

1547
01:48:14,404 --> 01:48:16,306
- With.
- With. This is a demonstration.

1548
01:48:16,406 --> 01:48:19,267
- We've decided to lead the groups.
- Why would you?

1549
01:48:19,367 --> 01:48:21,103
- I'm not getting rid of the banner.
- No.

1550
01:48:21,203 --> 01:48:23,105
- Listen.
- There's got to be some compromise.

1551
01:48:23,205 --> 01:48:25,357
- Why?
- That's the way you get things done.

1552
01:48:25,457 --> 01:48:28,110
- No, it fucking isn't. Listen.
- Why does everything get

1553
01:48:28,210 --> 01:48:30,028
so aggressive with you lot?

1554
01:48:30,128 --> 01:48:31,696
Listen to me! Listen to me!

1555
01:48:31,796 --> 01:48:33,740
Whether we march with
banners or without,

1556
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:36,701
the important thing is that
we march together, all of us.

1557
01:48:36,801 --> 01:48:38,995
That's what this has been
about since the beginning,

1558
01:48:39,095 --> 01:48:41,498
and that is absolutely
how it is going to end.

1559
01:48:41,598 --> 01:48:44,376
Together, us united.

1560
01:48:44,476 --> 01:48:45,836
Bloody hell.

1561
01:48:50,690 --> 01:48:51,883
Yeah!

1562
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:55,561
Hey!

1563
01:48:56,696 --> 01:48:58,473
I can't believe you're here.

1564
01:48:58,573 --> 01:49:01,518
I can't believe you're here.

1565
01:49:01,618 --> 01:49:05,355
Where are my lesbians?
Where are my lesbians?

1566
01:49:05,455 --> 01:49:07,065
- Hey.
- GWEN:

1567
01:49:07,165 --> 01:49:10,861
- Hey. Guys, I'm here.
