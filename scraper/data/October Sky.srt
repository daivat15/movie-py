(Man On Radio)
If you have just tuned in
to this special bulletin,

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,640
Washington has confirmed
that, yesterday,

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,520
on the fourth
of October, 1957,

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,760
the Soviet Union
successfully launched...

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,000
history's first
man-made satellite...

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,200
into space orbit
around the Earth.

(Switch Clicks)
(Motor Humming)

13
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,600
The satellite which the Russians
have dubbed Sputnik...

14
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,880
is being hailed
as a milestone in history.

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,680
No one in our nation's capital
could deny that the satellite...

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,520
has ushered in a grim
new chapter in the Cold War.

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,880
And indeed,
a wave of national anxiety...

18
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,800
already seems
to be sweeping the country.

19

Still maintaining its speed
of 18,000 miles an hour,

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,200
completing an orbit of the Earth
every 96 minutes.

21
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,280
Doctor Wernher von Braun,

22
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,880
Chief Engineer of the Army
Ballistic Missile Agency,

23
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,880
expressed the hope
that the United States...

24
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,160
would soon be following
the Russians into space...

25
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,360
with our own
artificial satellite.

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,280
Doctor von Braun confirmed...

27
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,040
that there has still been
no actual sighting
of the Soviet satellite,

28
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,040
but the U.S. Expects
to be tracking it very soon.

29
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,840
We are told that Sputnik will be
visible to the naked eye...

30
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,200
about an hour after sunset
and an hour before dawn,

as it traverses the October sky
over the United States.

32
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,800
What the beeping signal means
we still don't know.

33
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,720

and she ain't payin' attention
to nothin' but the movie,

136
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,400

after us.

152
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,320
Well, y'all be careful, Jim.
Last year, those two boys from
Welch got their arms broken.

153
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,480
Well, they started it.
(Laughing)

154
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,400
It don't matter much
who started it.
I don't call that football.

155
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,560
You don't worry about Jim.

156
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,960
Ain't nobody on the Welch team
that can catch him.

157
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,920
I wish the scouts could've seen
that first game with Bluefield.
I'm gonna build a rocket.

158
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,480
Like Sputnik.

159
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,600
Well, I'm not sayin' it's gonna
go up in space or anything,

160
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,520
but I'm gonna do it.

161
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,600
I'm gonna build a rocket.
(Chuckles)

162
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,760
Well, just don't
blow yourself up.

163
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,880
(Laughing)

164
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,400
More eggs, anybody?

165
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,320
Nice rocket, Homer.
How high do you think
it will fly?

166
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,720
Well, I got it packed with
the powder from 30 sky rockets.

167
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,640
Three, four miles.

168
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,320
You ready?
Yeah.

169
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,080
Yeah.
(All)
Ten, nine...

170
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,280
Eight, seven, six...
Should we get behind somethin'?

171
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,040
(Grunting)

172
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,120
(Gasps)
Wh-What happened?

173
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,920
- (Homer)
My rocket blew up.
- Are you okay?

174
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,920
- I guess.
- My heart's poundin'.

175
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,440
I thought the mine blew up.
Oh, Homer.

176
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,160
I waited six months for
the company carpenter to get
around puttin' up that fence.

177
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,400
Didn't I tell you
not to blow yourself up?

178
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,880
Yes, ma'am.

179
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,960
Then let's not.
(Sighs)

180
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,240
(Woman) Elsie.
(Elsie)
It's all right, Ms. Fields.!

181
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,520
It's all right.

182
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,240
(Homer's Voice)
Dear Dr. Von Braun,

183
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,160
(TV Announcer)
Six, five, four, three...
My name is Homer Hickam.

184
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,560
Two, one...
I'm 17 and I live in a small
mining town in West Virginia.

185
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,520
Ignition.

186
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,040
Liftoff. Liftoff.

187
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,680
I'm writing to offer
my condolences to you
and your team...

188
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,960
on your recent attempt
to launch the Vanguard rocket.

189
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,920
I also had a disastrous
occurrence during the launch
of my own small rocket.

190
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,800
Since here in Coalwood,
everyone's much more
interested...

191
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,240
in what's down below the earth
than what's above it,

192
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,000
there isn't a whole lot
of material to be found
on the subject of rocketry.

193
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,240
So I've been kind of stumbling
around in the dark.

He's a weirdo.
You go ahead,

but you can kiss

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,760
Hi, Homer.
Hi.

203
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,200
I don't let anybody
copy my homework.

204
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,760
I don't wanna copy
your homework.

205
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,360
Um,

206
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,400
do you know anything
about rockets?

207
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,960
Of course I do.

208
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,720
Uh, you wanna come with me
over to the library?

209
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,680
No.

210
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,280
(Students Murmuring)

211
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,840
What do you wanna know
about rockets?

212
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,400
Everything.

213
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,680
Well, rocketry was actually
invented by the Chinese
as early as 1,000 A.D.

214
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,840
And, supposedly,
they were quite sophisticated.

215
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,720
(Chattering Continues)

216
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,680
Potassium chlorate and sulphur.

217
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,760
Uh, well,
what'd you use?

218
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,360
Uh, somethin' like that.

219
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,480
(Homer)
Hey, Quentin, this is great.

220
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,280
This is exactly... We have
everything we need in here.

221
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,200
Roy Lee,
drive me to my house.

222
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,160
We can use my basement.
Yeah, at least nobody'll
see us down there.

223
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,760
Go, go, go.
(Engine Turning Over)

224
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,600
Come on.
(Quentin)
You got a loose choke cable.

225
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,520
You hear that?

226
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,680
The butterfly valve
isn't closin' all the way.

227
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,280
Uh, last year I built
an internal combustion engine...

228
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,400
and entered it
in the science fair.

229
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,160
Yeah, well, you wouldn't happen
to have it on you, would you?

This thing's startin'
to look like a rocket.

244
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,880
Listen to this.
"Weld the washer
to the base of the rocket body,

245
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,680
creating a combustion chamber
and nozzle."

246
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,640
We don't know how to weld.
Weld.

247
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,480
Homer,
your brother's in metal shop.
Maybe he could, uh...

248
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,120
- Do we really need
this nozzle thing?
- For cryin'out loud,

249
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,360
the nozzle's
the most important part.

250
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,080
It directs the flow
of the hot gases.!
Hey, cool it, Quentin.

251
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,520
(Roy Lee)
Man, talkin'about
your hot gases.

252
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,960
I don't think your father
would like you sneaking up in
the middle of the night in here.

253
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,920
And I know that he wouldn't
like me welding for you
on company time.

254
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,280
Well, what if I paid
the company for your time?

255
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,640
Homer, I can't.

256
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,080
I would lose my job.

257
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,160
Did you see Sputnik go over
the other night?
Nah.

259
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,040
'Cause it was beautiful.

260
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,200
I stood there and watched it
streak across the sky.

261
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:06,880
And anywhere in the world,
someone could look up
and see exactly what I saw.

262
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,040
For once, it felt like Coalwood
was part of the outside world.

263
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,080
Homer, believe me,
there are much worse places
than Coalwood in this world.

264
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,080
Besides, this is just
a flying piece of steel.

265
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,160
You know, a rocket
took it up there, Mr. Bykovsky.

266
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,360
I don't know. L...

267
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,800
When I was workin'
on this rocket, I felt like,

268
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,160
I felt like I was,
like I was Wernher von Braun.

269
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,120
Let me see.

270
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,720
Homer,

271
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,200
it will be our secret.

272
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,640
Mr. Bykovsky did
a dang good job on this.

273
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,200
Yeah, well,
he used a washer for the weld.

274
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,880
Man, it looks just like it did
in the picture.
Prodigious.

275
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,800
When, uh,
when do we go?

276
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,720
Give me that.
Uh, Saturday...

277
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,880
What is this,
a weapon of some kind?

278
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,040
(Homer Chuckling)
No, sir. It's a,
it's a rocket.

279
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,720
I don't allow dangerous devices
on school grounds.

280
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,720
Mr. Turner, I asked Homer
to bring that to school.
To show it in class.

281
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,120
You know, the boys are
thinkin' about enterin'
that county science fair.

282
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,920
Be careful, gentlemen.
I'm gonna have my eye on you.

283
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,760
Thank you, Mr. Turner.

284
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,800
That science fair is rigged.
All the judges are from Welch,

285
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,280
so only the kids from Welch
ever win.

286
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,000
And besides,
science fairs are for geeks.

287
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,920
No offense, Quentin.

288
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,840
Well, it's too bad
you feel that way.

289
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,560
You know, the winners go on
to the National Science Fair
in Indianapolis,

290
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,040
and colleges from all over the
country hand out scholarships.

291
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,040
It's great.
Have a good lunch, boys.

292
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,760
College scholarships
for winning a science fair?

293
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,720
Well, maybe
it's not for you.

294
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,720
W-W-Well,
what do you mean?
Homer, you got a great mind.

295
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,920
But science requires math,
which has never been one
of your favorite subjects.

296
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,640
(Chuckling)
Can't just dream your way
out of Coalwood, Homer.

297
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,520
Auk I.
Stroke of genius, Homer.

298
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,640
It won't fly unless somebody
lights the fuse.

299
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,800
What the hell is auk?

300
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,880
It's a bird that don't fly.

301
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,080
What, kind of like
a parakeet?

302
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,880
Ready?
(Whistle Blowing)

303
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,320
Well, Youngstown's
always been fair, Otis,

304
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,040
(Chuckling)
But you're askin' me to lay off
damn near half the town.

305
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,280
The mine
is just not producin'...

306
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,360
the way it was
ten years ago, John.

307
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,240
We're payin'the same labor
for half the tonnage.

308
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,440
What if we were
to open up a new shaft?

309
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,760
(John)
That coal is down there, Otis.

310
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,400
You just, you just
let me go after it.

311
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,600
The Coalwood mine
is givin' out, Mr. Hickam.

312
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,040
Move!

313
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,280
Ten...
(All)
Nine, eight,

314
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,360
seven, six, five,

315
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,040
four, three, two...

316
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,600
Uh-oh.
Holy shit,
it's headed for the mine!

317
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,560
- (Yelling)
- I told you we didn't know
what we were doin'!

318
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,480
I told you!
Oh, no. Oh, no.

319
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,840
(Chattering, Shouting)

320
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,920
(Chattering Continues)

321
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,600
(Man)
I don't believe this.
Go ahead.

322
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,200
(Man)
God in heaven, I thought
it was a guided missile.!

323
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,120
(Laughing)
I thought the damn Russians
were attackin'us.

324
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,120
(Man)
The boy's in trouble now.

325
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,520
So this is what you been up to
in the basement, huh?

326
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,480
Yes, sir.
Damn, Homer.

327
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,960
You could've killed somebody
with this idiot thing.

328
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,920
I know, sir.
I'm sorry. I was...

329
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,640
Well, Homer here
wants to be a rocket scientist.
Is that it, John?

330
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,600
He has no idea
what he wants to be.

331
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,560
But I know what he is.
He's a menace,

332
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,480
and he's a damn thief.

333
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,360
Dad...
And so is whoever
helped you.

334
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,600
Ike Bykovsky did this,
didn't he?

335
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,000
Don't you ever
let me catch you...

336
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,440
with these fool things
on company property again,
you understand me?

337
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,560
Yes, sir.
Then go home.

338
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,880
(Phone Ringing)

339
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,720
(Thunderclap)
Yeah?
What's your tunnel number?

340
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,200
He called me a thief, Ma,
in front of everybody.

341
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,760
I mean, how could he do that?
He was dead wrong
callin' you that.

342
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,720
He'd never have done that
to Jim.

343
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,760
They could catch Jim
stickin' up the company store,

344
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,560
and Dad would probably laugh
and say, "That's my boy."

345
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,920
I know he's hard to understand
sometimes, Homer,

346
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,840
but you have to know
he loves you.

347
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,320
He loves the mine...

348
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,280
more than Jim even.

349
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,200
More than you.
You hush up.

350
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,320
(TV: Screaming)
What's it given him back?

351
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,520
Nothin' but a spot on his lung
the size of a damn quarter.

352
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,240
You don't know
what the mine gives me.

353
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,800
You don't know
'cause you're still a boy.

354
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,760
But, by golly, you're gonna
find out soon enough.

355
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,360
(Thunder Continues)

356
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,520
(Scoffs)
I'm never goin' down there.

357
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,320
(Fork Clatters)

358
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,760
You better have a talk
with your son, Elsie,

359
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,520
'cause he's out of control.

360
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,560
Where's my rocket stuff?
Right where they belong.

361
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,520
(Gunshot)

362
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,360
Quentin, you know, that rocket
went up at least 100 feet.
(Gunshots Continue)

363
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,280
More like 200.

364
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,880
(Gunshot)
God...

365
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,520
Man, will you cut it out,
Roy Lee?
Die, you son of a bitch.

366
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,000
Come on.
My turn now.
Hey, man. What's with you?

367
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,080
Man, we should be tryin'
to get in that science fair...

368
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,200
instead of sittin' around here
like a bunch of hillbillies.

369
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,800
I got some really
bad news for you, Homer.
We are a bunch of hillbillies.

370
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,800
Besides, um, didn't your dad
say no more rockets?

371
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,600
No. He said no more rockets
on company property.

372
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,040
Do you realize
how far we'd have to go
to get off company property?

373
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,960
Yeah. We have
to go to Snakeroot.

374
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,240
Snakeroot?
That's eight miles.

375
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,320
It's not that far.
I mean, we could walk
if we have to.

376
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,640
Oh, walk.
That's a fantastic idea.
(Laughing)

377
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,320
Let's go! Come on!
Wake the hell up,
will ya, Homer?

378
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,560
I got about as much chance
of winnin' that science fair...

379
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,800
as you do winnin'
a football scholarship.

380
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,720
I know I'm gonna be
a miner.

381
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,120
I've known my entire life.

382
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,040
What the hell's so bad
about minin' coal?

383
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,960
Nothin', Roy Lee.
Coal minin's great.

384
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,160
That's why your step daddy’s
the biggest drunk
in West Virginia.

385
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,320
I mean, come on, guys!
You know the mine'll kill ya.

386
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,120
Did you ever hear the story
about how O'Dell's dad died?

387
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,520
- Homer,
will you forget it, man?
- Shut up, Homer.

388
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,240
Apiece of slate
caught him right in the neck
and cut his head clear off.

389
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,400
Bitch! Come on!
(Grunting)

390
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,840
O'Dell!

391
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,800
(Car Horn Honking)
Get off of me!

392
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,600
Hey, fellas.
We're lookin' for U.S. 52.

393
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,600
(Engine Revving)

394
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,600
Uh, fellas?

395
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,280
Uh, just, uh, stay left
at the fork. It's about another
five miles straight ahead.

396
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,120
Thanks.

397
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,080
You fellas see the way
she was lookin' at me?

398
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,360
Man, you all wanna
be coal miners,

399
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,760
you all go ahead
and be coal miners.

400
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,360
There. There.

401
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,760
God's honest truth, Homer,

402
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,920
what are the chances...

403
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,120
of a bunch of kids
from Coalwood...

404
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,880
actually winnin'
the National Science Fair?

405
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,120
A million to one, O'Dell.

406
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,840
That good?

407
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,280
Well, why didn't you say so?
Come on. Give me that.

408
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,960
Quentin.
(Grunts)

409
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,440
What?
(Both Chuckling)

410
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,240
We hiked eight miles
for this?

411
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,960
Oh, it's great.
What should we call it?

412
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,880
How 'bout a slack dump?

413
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,720
(O'Dell)
What about "No Man's Land'?

414
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,160
Cape Coalwood.

415
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,600
I mean, it's perfect.

416
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,880
We could build a blockhouse
over there...

417
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,800
and, and a, and a,
and a launch pad.

418
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,160
And we could even build
a test stand.!

419
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,360
(Homer's Voice)
Dear Dr. Von Braun,

420
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,680
our launch site,
which we've named Cape Coalwood,

421
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,800
is nearing completion.
(Shouting)

422
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,120
Thanks to the generosity
of local businesses.

Inspired by our efforts,

427
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,400
everyone is anxious to help
by donating materials.

428
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,120
(Chattering, Laughing)
We've been fortunate to have
the support of our classmates.

429
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,600
And the whole community
here in Coalwood is behind us.

430
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,120
Hey, rocket boy.
Mars is that way.
(Laughing)

431
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,880
But no one has been more
encouraging to our efforts
than my father.

432
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,960
No, the company doesn't have
any cement left over
for launch pads.

433
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,880
I just thought I'd ask.

434
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,920
Besides, I told you
no more rockets.

435
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,080
Uh, you said no more rockets
on company property.

436
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,200
And Olga
doesn't own Snakeroot.

437
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,040
So, you walk eight miles?

438
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,960
Yes, sir.

439
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,320
Well, tell me something,
Homer.

440
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,520
Uh, what exactly is
this Wernher von Braun...

441
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,160
and the rest of those Germans
accomplishin' anyway?

442
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,520
'Cause if you ask me,
it's nothin' but a stunt.

443
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,240
You think, you think catchin' up
to the Russians in space
is a stunt?

444
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,280
When the novelty wears off,
they're all gonna be
sent packin'.

445
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:35,000
Maybe then they'll have
to find themselves a real job.
Like minin' coal?

446
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,000
You listen here.

447
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,160
The coal we mine
makes steel, Homer.

448
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,520
And if steel fails,
this country fails.

449
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,120
If you had half a damn brain

00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,840
Well, who's down there now?

452
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,480
Hold on just a second.
Hey, listen here.

453
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,480
I had an engineer estimate
a new walkway.

454
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,920
They had some cement left over,

455
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,400
so it got caught in the rain...
it's probably ruined.

456
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,080
But if you wanna haul it out,
it's all yours.

457
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,040
Thanks, Dad.

458
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,160
I'll be down there
in a minute.

459
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,600
And Miss Riley wanted
to make sure you document
your results.

460
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,920
You will be graded
when she returns.

461
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You have one hour.

462
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,920
Potassium chloride
has a potassium atom.

463
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,760
If we mix it with sugar
and add heat,

464
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,440
we'll get three parts oxygen,
two parts carbon dioxide,

465
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,680
along with some
other by-products.

466
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,040
In other words, lots
of good expanding gases.

467
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,640
It should make
an excellent propellant.

468
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,840
It smells like candy. Ooh!

Welding
is very difficult, Homer.
I could learn.

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,160
you were gonna be shootin' off
another rocket up here today.

I'm all right.

I'm sorry about that, sir.
Oh, that's all right.
That's all right.

509
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,680
Homer, I flew with the Red Tails
in World War II.

510
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,000
And seein' that rocket
come at me...

511
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,160
it almost
took me back there.

512
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,520
Hey, let me have
a look at that thing.

513
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,840
That's a good job
on the weld, Homer,

514
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,920
but the heat from the exhaust
melted the washer.

515
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,760
It's referred to
as a nozzle... uh, sir.

516
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,040
Son, you can call it
whatever you wanna call it,

517
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,400
but you're gonna have to have
a better steel that can take
the heat.

518
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,440
Now I'd say S.A.E. 10-20 bar
stock ought to do you fine.

519
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,840
And I can order it for you.
Well, that'd be great,
Mr. Bolden.

520
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:06,360
But it's kind of expensive.
Um...

521
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:10,000
Twelve miles of scrap iron,
and all we gotta do
is pop it loose.

522
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,320
Yeah. Now what are we gonna
tell the railroad when they
catch us pryin' up the track?

523
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,840
It's abandoned.
See, the county's covered

these kids an education,
not false hopes.

False hopes?

707
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:53,000
Do you want me to sit quiet,
let 'em breathe in coal dust

Got some good news
for you, Homer.

717

Say hello to Fred Smith from
the University of West Virginia.

718

Hello, Homer.
Hi, sir.

719
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,800
Mr. Smith wants Jim to play
football there. He's offerin'
him a full scholarship.

720
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,720
Well, congratulations, Jim.

721
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,960
Do you play ball, son?

722
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,640
No, Homer shoots off rockets.
Whoosh and all that st...

723
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,560
Well, rockets
are not exactly my field, son,

724
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,960
but maybe if you work hard,
you'll go to college too.

725
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,600
Yeah, on a science fiction
scholarship, maybe.

thank you
for the autographed picture.

728
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,760

to keep working...

to come see it.

I gotta catch up
on some work.

how come you never have work
when Jim plays football?

00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,320
Yeah, I see it.
What's the time?

756
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,320
Looks like 12 seconds.
Which one of you fellas
is Homer Hickam?

757
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,800
Um, it's me, sir.
I'm Basil Thorpe
with the Bluefield Telegraph.

758
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,320
Can I ask you
a few questions?

759
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,240
Sure.
(Chuckles)

760
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:20,280
(Homer) "The silvery cylinder
burst forth in a fiery column
of smoke and flame,

761
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,600
"racing the very wind
as it soared into the sky,

762
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,800
"a messenger of these
Rocket Boys of Big Creek...

763
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,440
"these boys who use
their brains, not brawn,

764
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,840
who play not football,
but with Apollo's fire."

765
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,000
(All Chuckling)
Hi, Homer.

766
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,960
Hi, Dorothy.
Would you please sign
my newspaper?

767
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,240
Sure.

768
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,720
I just know you're gonna be
really famous someday.

769

- H-O-M-E-R.
- (Dorothy Giggling)

770
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,880
Which one of you fellas
is Homer Hickam?

771
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,320
Excuse me. Excuse me.

772
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,920
Which cost the taxpayers...
What in the world
is goin' on?

773
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,400
Miss Riley,
this does not concern you.

774
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,640
You have these boys
in handcuffs.

775
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:11,880
You have these boys
in handcuffs in a high school,
Mr. Turner.

776
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,960
You probably heard
about the forest fire last week
over by Welch.

777
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,520
A lot of timber went up.
Mr. Turner, you take
these handcuffs off these boys.

778
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,080
They found a rocket
on the side of the road.

779
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:24,280
We knew it started the fire,
ma'am. What we didn't know
is where it came from,

780
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,080
till this morning.

781
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,000
Mr. Hickam, can you account
for all your rockets?

782
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,880
No, sir. I can't.

783
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,280
(Chattering)

784
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,200
If you weren't a minor,
you'd be in the state penitentiary.

785
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,840
I know, Dad. L...
Homer, I've been
confused by you,

786
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,160
I've been mad as hell
at you.

787
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,080
But, boy, it's the first time
in your life I've been ashamed
of you.

788
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,840
(Roy Lee Grunting, Yelling)

789
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,840
- (Grunting Continues)
- You couldn't stop, man.
You couldn't!

790
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,720
Get in the car, Homer!
(Yelling Continues)

791
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,640
Homer, get in the car.

792
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,840
(Man Grunting)
Idiot.! I ought
to goddamn kill ya.

793
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,520
(Grunts)

794
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,720
We ain't at the mine now.
This ain't your business.

795
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,080
You get in the car
with Homer, son.

796
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,720
You listen to me,
you drunken son of a bitch.

797
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,080
If that boy's father was alive,
he'd kick your ass.

798
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,160
So I'm gonna
have to do it for him.

799
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,640
If I see him with a bruise,
you get a scar.

800
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,400
If I see him with a limp,
you get crutches!

801
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:40,040
(John)
You hear me?
Do you hear me?

802
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,640
You know,
I'm reportin' you to the union!

803
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,120
Screw you
and your damn union.

804
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:09,120
Your father was
one of the best men
I ever had workin' for me.

805
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,840

there's a chance your dad

for all of it.

Carbon crystals

Yeah. Honeymoon.
At Myrtle Beach.

889
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:46,320
And you said,
"You always wanted diamonds.

890
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,040
But these are
the best I can do.
I wish they were real."

00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:54,120
John, I never
wanted diamonds.

892

This whole year...

893
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:05,000
has been pretty rough going
down at the mine.

894
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,040
Bad tempers...

895
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:12,120
and a lot of strike talk.

makes things worse.

897

In a way, I guess,

898
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:24,120
I'm the one who's responsible
for what happened
to Mr. Bykovsky.

899
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,520
Listen to me, Homer.

900
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,440
Last month,

901
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,600
I gave Ike the chance
to go back to the machine shop,

902
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,520
and he turned it down.

903
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:39,760
Yeah, he stayed in the mine
'cause the money was better.

904
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,720
That was his decision.

905
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,960
You understand me?

906
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,880
Yes, sir.

907
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:54,920
Well, is mining coal as terrible
as you figured it'd be?

908
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,320
I guess not.

909
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,400
But almost.
(Laughing)

910
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,680
(Coughing)

911
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:24,440
Everybody says to say hi.
Michael and Billy.

912
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,600
Valentine Carmina.

913
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,520
How about Miss Riley?

914
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:33,320
She ain't been around much.
She got some new boyfriend
over in Welch.

915
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:37,880
So, uh, what's it like
down there?

916
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,640
You get used to it
after a while.

917
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,880
Besides, shoveling coal
has got its advantages.

918
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,360
Check this out.

919
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:54,160
Man, no wonder my stepdad
can slug me so good.

920
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,000
After a month down there,
you'd be able
to knock him out.

921
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,040
Well, I ain't
in no hurry.

922
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:06,840
(Work Whistle Blowing)

923
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,880
See ya all later.
See ya, man.

924
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,800
See ya, Homer.

925
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:20,160
In Christ's name,
we pray. Amen.

926
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,080
Amen.

927
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:29,440
We appreciate the sacrifice
you made here, Homer.

928
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:33,800
But pretty soon,
you'll be able to go back
and finish up the school year.

929
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:37,000
I'm not going back
to school.

930
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,400
A few weeks left in the term,

931
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,680
I'll just stay put.

932
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,560
Well, I think you ought
to finish high school.

933
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,400
Well, tell him, John.

934
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,360
Homer's not a boy anymore.

935
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,320
I don't think
I can tell him anything.

936
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,240
(Dishes Clattering)

937
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:14,360
(Jake) All I'm saying, John,
is the cutoff was not done
proper according to contract.

938
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,280
Well, the company did
what it had to do.

939
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,720
Well, you know the union
won't put up with it.

940
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:22,760
Just give it a rest, Jake.
It's my first day back.

941
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:31,240
Hey, Lenny,
how's he doing?

942
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,240
He's a chip
off the old block, John.

943
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:36,200
It's good
to have you back.
(Chuckling) Thank you.

944
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:44,800
Hi.
I'm headed toward the face.
You wanna come along?

945
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,400
(John)
Even though I don't have
that piece of paper...

946
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:54,640
the thing from college...
they listen to me.

947
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,560
You know why?

948
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,440
'Cause you know more
than they do.

949
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,600
You bet your life
I do. Homer.

950
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:06,280
I know the mine
like I know a man.

951
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:09,960
Heck, I can take
one look around here...
(Coughing)

952
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,960
Are you all right?

953
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,200
Yeah, I'm not afraid
of a little coal dust.

954
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:19,160
Hell, Homer,
I was born for this.

955
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:22,920
I guess
it shouldn't surprise me
that you were too.

956
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,480
Let's go watch 'em
shoot some coal.

957
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:36,800
Elsie, hold dinner
for a while, will you?

958
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,200
I have to make a call.

959
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,240
Homer,

960
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:51,760
I was in the store today,
and I heard some talk.

961
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:07,240
Boy, it's sure hard
to keep a secret in this town,
isn't it?

962
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:10,200
But I guess I did
a pretty good job.

963
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:14,960
You know, there's a rumor going
around that I been sneaking off
to Welch to see some beau.

964
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,840
I wish that rumor'd
been true.
Yeah.

965
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:22,960
They told me Hodgkin's
can go into remission,
so I might have some time.

966
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,480
Is there anything I can do,
Miss Riley?

967
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:28,720
You can accept
my apology.

968
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,400
For what?

969
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:33,800
My life's work
is teaching.

970
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:37,200
And I believed
that if you boys won
that science fair,

971
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:41,960
got scholarships, went off
and did something great
with your lives,

972
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:44,720
somehow my life
would have counted
for something.

973
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,560
Homer.

974
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,520
You know what?

975
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:58,280
Sometimes you really
can't listen to what
anybody else says.

976
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,240
You just gotta
listen inside.

977
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:04,200
You're not supposed to
end up in those mines.

978
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:07,600
You know why?
'Cause I think
you made other plans.

979
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,960
I want you
to know something.

980
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:15,120
I'm proud of you.
I am.

981
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,960
Whatever you choose.

982
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,600
(Ringing)

983
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,160
(Mine Alarm Blaring)

984
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:59,440
Excuse me, ma'am,
is Quentin home?

985
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,560
Quentin.

986
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:14,040
Homer, y-you figured
this equation out
by yourself?

987
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:17,640
Well, if I did the math right.
It proves that you can't...

988
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:20,560
l-It proves we didn't
start that fire!
Quentin, what're you doin'?

989
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,000
Now, the AUKXIII was
the only one that we couldn't
find that day.

990
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,560
And our best guess
for fall time
with the AUKXII,

991
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,560
which is exactly identical,
was about 14 seconds.

992
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,880
If you help me
with the trig part,
Quentin,

993
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:35,480
we should be able
to make a good guess
where that rocket landed.

994
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,080
Six thousand,
three hundred
and twenty-eight feet.

995
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:54,760
One point two miles.

996
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,920
Homer?
Yeah?

997
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:04,920
Are you gonna tell
Roy Lee and O'Dell
where I live?

998
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,720
It wouldn't matter
if you lived
in the governor's mansion,

999
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:13,280
they'd still think
you're weird.

1000
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:20,240
I'll see you at dawn.

1001
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,960
Don't you have to go
to the mine?

1002
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,360
I don't work there
anymore.

1003
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:42,120
One.

1004
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:50,560
Two.

1005
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,480
Ninety-nine.

1006
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,040
A hundred seven.

1007
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,920
One hundred
and twenty-six.

1008
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,720
That's 6,300 feet.

1009
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,000
It's gotta be
around here somewhere.

1010
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:59,720
What'd we do wrong?

1011
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:03,440
I don't know.
L-I'll check the math again.

1012
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,920
Was there a wind
that day?

1013
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,240
L-I don't remember.

1014
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:19,400
'Cause if there was,

1015
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,960
the wind probably came
from the west...

1016
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:24,480
which means that
it would've pushed
the rocket...

1017
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:28,440
right there.

1018
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,760
Prodigious.

1019
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,560
...associated...

1020
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,480
(Students Murmuring)

1021
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,280
Mr. Hayes,
where you off to
in such a hurry?

1022
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:49,000
Okay, everybody,
back in your seats.

1023
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:53,360
Miss Stanton, Miss Blue,
let's go, back in your seats.
Mr. Hancock.

1024
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,400
That goes for you too,
Mr. Wilson.

1025
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:02,600
Miss Riley,
what's going on in here?

1026
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:06,280
They didn't start
that fire, Mr. Turner.

1027
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:09,000
In the first place,
you are not a member
of this classroom.

1028
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,000
Neither are you,
Mr. Turner.
(Students Chuckling)

1029
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,920
Why don't you let the boy
defend himself?

1030
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,880
And in the second place,
this rocket proves nothing.

1031
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,640
You've already admitted
having lost a number
of your rockets.

1032
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:21,680
You cannot prove
conclusively...

1033
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:25,080
that another one of them
didn't start that fire.
Yes, I can.

1034
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:34,240
Are we to conclude,
Mr. Hickam, that
since leaving school,

1035
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,480
you've not only become an expert
in rocket science, but in
the field of trigonometry?

1036
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,400
I didn't say
that I was a rock...
Obviously, you learned more...

1037
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,120
in the coal mines
than you did in high school.
(Students Chuckling)

1038
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:46,480
Let the boy talk.
Go ahead, Homer.

1039
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:50,400
Now, that fire was near Welch,
just under three miles
from our launch pad.

1040
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:54,920
And at the time of the fire,
the best that we could do
was 1.2 miles...

1041
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,520
which is exactly where we found
that rocket, Mr. Turner.

1042
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,640
See, Mr. Turner, that rocket
fell for about 14 seconds,
which means...

1043
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:04,280
that it flew to an altitude
of 3,000 feet...

1044
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,800
according to the equation...

1045
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:10,120
"S" equals one-half"A"
"T" squared...

1046
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:13,600
where "S'is the altitude,
A'is the gravity constant...
or 32...

1047
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:16,200
and "T" is the time
it took for that rocket
to come back down.

1048
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:19,160
Velocity equals
acceleration times time.
Get him, Homer, get him.

1049
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:21,400
Are you following this,
Mr. Turner?
(Students Chuckling)

1050
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,440
All right,
we're all duly impressed.

1051
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:28,400
But do you mind telling me,
if you did not start that fire,
who did?

1052
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,480
(Phone Ringing)

1053
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,520
What is it?

1054
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:36,760
Whatever it is,
i-it's ingenious.
The fins are spring-loaded.

1055
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,960
That isn't a rocket
at all.

1056
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,360
It's an aeronautical flare.

1057
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:47,280
There's an airport here
in Welch. It's right above
where the fire started.

1058
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:59,920
Mr. Hickam,
report to my office as soon
as we return to school.

1059
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,960
You do intend to enter
the county science fair,
do you not?

1060
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,080
Yes, sir, we do.

1061
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:08,680
Well, if you intend
to represent Big Creek,

1062
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:11,560
you're gonna have to be
enrolled as a student
at Big Creek.

1063
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:13,480
(Engine Starting)

1064
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:16,840
"Prodigenous."

1065
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:21,640
(Homer) Do you think
you can draw well enough
so Mr. Bolden could build it?

1066
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,560
Yep.
Let me see.

1067
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:26,200
Yeah.
Hey, Homer.

1068
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:29,320
- Hi, Dad.
- What's this stuff doin' here?

1069
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:32,520
Mr. Hickam, we didn't
start the fire.
The troopers gave it back to us.

1070
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:34,800
Yeah, it wasn't even
one of our rockets.
It was an aeronautical flare.

1071
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,840
Y'all go on home now.

1072
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:38,760
Yes, sir.

1073
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:59,040
This the reason
you skipped work today?
Yes, sir.

1074
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:06,160
I thought you put
all this nonsense
behind you, Homer.

1075
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,760
I thought you weren't
gonna be doin' it...
Dad, it isn't nonsense.

1076
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,080
L-I don't wanna
argue with you.

1077
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,440
Look, son,

1078
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:16,960
I can't even begin to tell you
how proud of you I've been
these past weeks.

1079
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:21,640
I mean, you've just been
doin' a hell of a job
in that mine.

1080
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:24,440
You keep goin',
you're gonna have
my job someday.

1081
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,560
Everybody says so.

1082
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:31,560
You got any idea how proud
that would make me?

1083
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,720
Dad, what l...
(Stammering)

1084
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:40,240
I guess what I'm sayin' is,
is that if this rocket stuff
is so important to you,

1085
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:44,040
then so be it,
as long as you're careful.

1086
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,680
Guess there's worse hobbies
you could have.

1087
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:50,440
But skippin'work,
that's out of line.

1088
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:53,120
And you gotta know that.

1089
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:56,720
So let's go
and get you right
with Jake.

1090
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,480
Tell him you'll work
the hoot owl shift tonight.

1091
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:00,840
No.

1092
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,240
The coal mine's your life.
It's not mine.

1093
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:16,520
I'm never going
down there again.

1094
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,680
I wanna go into space.

1095
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:50,840
(Man)
Homer Hickam, Roy Lee Cook,
Quentin Wilson...

1096
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:53,040
and Sherman O'Dell
of Big Creek High...

1097
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,880
for their ingenious display
of amateur rocket-building
techniques.

1098
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,560
I can't believe
we beat the kid
with the robot dog.

1099
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:21,120
And I thought
the see-through ear
was gonna win.

1100
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,600
I got Miss Wade workin'
on your travel arrangements,

1101
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:27,440
so you boys are gonna
have to decide who's goin'
to Indianapolis.

1102
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:30,120
We're all goin'.
Yeah.

1103
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:33,880
Son, I wish you could,
but we can't afford
to send all four of you.

1104
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:37,840
Only one. Let me know
what you decide. I'm gonna
have to know by Friday.

1105
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,800
You boys did
a fine job today.

1106
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:54,520
I need to borrow a suitcase,
and I'm gonna need
you guys' addresses...

1107
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:57,800
because I'm gonna
write some postcards.
Oh, you shut up, Roy Lee.

1108
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:00,760
Come on, you dope.
You know, you're goin',
Homer.

1109
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,680
Yeah.
Yeah.

1110
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:05,800
Say hello
to the outside world
for us.

1111
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:08,040
Do we know
what we want?
(All) Yeah!

1112
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,800
Are we gettin' it?
(All) No!

1113
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:13,600
All right!
All in favor of goin' out
on strike, say "aye"!

1114
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,040
(All)
Aye!

1115
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:17,320
All right, let's go.!
(Shouting)

1116
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:20,120
All right, shut 'em down.!
Let's go.!

1117
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:24,200
Strike.! Strike.!
Strike.!

1118
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,120
(Shouting Continues)

1119
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,080
Well, they sure are
gettin' themselves
worked up.

1120
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,000
Everybody's sayin'
this one's gonna be
a long one.

1121
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:48,000
And it will,
if I have anything
to say about it.

1122
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:49,960
Ungrateful
sons of bitches.

1123
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,640
Mom, have you seen
the big green suitcase?
Did you look in the attic?

1124
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:57,720
Yes, ma'am.
Well, I don't know. John,
you know where the suitcase is?

1125
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:03,320
How the hell should I know
where the suitcase is?

1126
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,320
I don't know, sug.

1127
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,240
(Mother Murmuring)

1128
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:12,400
(Sighing)

1129
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:19,280
(Gunshot,
Glass Shattering)

1130
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:22,920
- John!
- Y'all stay inside!

1131
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:29,080
(Tires Screeching)
Vernon!

1132
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:31,160
(Jim)
I'm gonna kill
that son of a bitch.!

1133
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:33,160
Oh, don't be
a damn fool.

1134
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:37,800
All right, well,
what are we gonna do?
Nothin'.

1135
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:41,400
Drunken bastard couldn't hit
the broad side of a barn.

1136
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:43,520
He tried to kill you, Dad.
Yeah, Dad,
you can't just stand...

1137
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,280
Hey, hey, don't
trouble yourself, Homer.

1138
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:48,760
You got
more important things
to worry about.

1139
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:52,440
(John)
Just go look
for your suitcase.

1140
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:59,000
Forget about it, Homer.

1141
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:00,920
Shut up, Jim!

1142
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,840
Listen, I'm sorry about
what's goin' on around here,
but it isn't my fault!

1143
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:08,800
What do you want
from me anyway?
Better watch yourself, Homer!

1144
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:11,240
If I win at Indianapolis,
maybe I can go to college,

1145
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:13,280
maybe even get a job
at Cape Canaveral!

1146
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,440
There's nothing here for me.!
The town is dyin'!

1147
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,680
The mine is dyin'!
Everybody knows it here
but you!

1148
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:22,000
You wanna get out of here
so bad, then go! Go!

1149
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,320
Yeah, I'll go!
Yeah, I'll go!

1150
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:24,680
Go, go!
I'll go!

1151
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:29,720
And I'll be gone forever!
I won't even look back!

1152
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:34,800
(Door Slamming)

1153
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:13,480
(Man)
Welcome to Indianapolis.!

1154
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:16,480
Visitors to the fair
will include prominent members
of every branch...

1155
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:18,720
of the national
scientific community.

1156
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:21,000
The fair will be open
to the public
over the next two days.

1157
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:25,800
The following day,
the judges will arrive
to select the winners.

1158
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:30,760
By timing the rocket's descent,
we would be able to figure out
just how high the rocket flew.

1159
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,200
Would you like to see?
This is a Delaval nozzle.

1160
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:38,360
Do any of y'all know
what a Delaval noz...

1161
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:51,280
Two, please.
The judges always go
for the most expensive exhibits.

1162
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,200
That guy with
the biosphere's gonna win.

1163
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:57,000
I don't think so.
My money's on the kid
with the rocket display.

1164
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,880
Have you seen it yet?
It's really cool.

1165
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:07,280
(Woman On P.A.)
Mr. Owens,
to the security office.

1166
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:09,440
Mr. Owens,
to the security office, please.

1167
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:21,680
It's not like we got a hell
of a lot of time, Roy Lee.
The judging is tomorrow.

1168
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,600
There's nothin' we can do
without Mr. Bolden.

1169
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,880
And he can't get anywhere
near the machine shop.

1170
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:29,680
They even took my picture
of Dr. Von Braun.

1171
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,600
They stole everything.

1172
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:35,760
(Car Horn Honking)

1173
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,840
Leon, what are you doing
back here?

1174
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:44,960
You know you shouldn't
be seen back here.

1175
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:47,240
I know, Elsie,
but Homer's in trouble.

1176
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,920
(Shouting)

1177
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,720
Elsie, I don't have the power
to settle this strike.

1178
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:08,600
The bosses listen to you.
They'll do what you tell 'em.

1179
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:11,120
I am not gonna crawl
on my belly...

1180
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:14,600
in front of those
miserable union rats.

1181
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:17,320
Is that what this
is about, John?
Is this about your pride?

1182
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,720
No, it's about what's best
for Coalwood.

1183
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:24,640
If this mine
doesn't produce,
then the town dies.

1184
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:28,400
Think the union gives
a good damn about that?

1185
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:30,920
They're nothin'
but a bunch of greedy
sons of bitches that...

1186
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,840
Shut up, John.
Just shut up.

1187
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:35,960
Homer once said
you love the mine more
than your own family.

1188
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:38,360
And I took up for you
'cause I didn't wanna
believe it.

1189
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:41,280
Homer has gotten a lot of help
from the people in this town.

1190
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:44,320
They've helped him build
his rockets, they've gone out
there and watched him fly 'em.

1191
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:48,520
But not you, John.
You never showed up.
Not even once.

1192
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,560
Now, I'm not asking you
to believe in him,

1193
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:53,240
but he's your son,
for God's sake, John.

1194
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:56,280
And I am askin' you
to help him.

1195
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:58,200
If you don't,
I'll leave you.

1196
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:01,000
I'll find work.
I'll do whatever it takes
to get away from here.

1197
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:06,160
I'll live in a tree
to get away from you.
Don't you think I won't.

1198
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,680
Where would you go?

1199
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,920
Myrtle Beach.

1200
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:21,040
(Door Opens, Closes)

1201
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,840
I guess we all know
this isn't gonna fix things,

1202
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:32,240
uh, at least not for long.

1203
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,760
We know you did
what you could for us.

1204
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:36,880
Jake.
Thanks.

1205
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,760
Leon.

1206
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,680
Yes, John.

1207
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:45,680
Don't you have
some work to do?

1208
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:00,360
It's packed and shipped
and on its way. Be at
the bus station, 8:00 a.m.

1209
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:03,080
Okay, Mom,
but how'd you...
Your father, Homer.

1210
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:05,320
It was your father.
Give 'em hell, Homer!

1211
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:07,240
(Cheering)

1212
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:12,960
- Good luck, sweetie.
- Bye.

1213
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,120
(Coin Clinks)

1214
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:27,560
Thanks, Dad.

1215
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:43,160
(Homer) When
the rocket propellant burns,
it produces a river of gas...

1216
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:45,600
which flows through
the convergent section
of the nozzle.

1217
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:47,880
If the river continues
through the nozzle,

1218
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:49,840
but through the throat
at less than sonic speed...

1219
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,320
that is to say, less than
the speed of sound...

1220
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:55,600
it becomes compact in the...
compacted in the divergent
section,

1221
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:57,520
bound in turmoil
and inefficient.

1222
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:02,000
Lyle Wells and Jean Cooper,
Schrader High School,
McMinnville, Oregon.

1223
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:23,240
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
the big moment.

1224
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:26,840
The Highest Scholastic
Achievement Award
for Science.

1225
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:30,280
The National Science Fair
first prize gold medal...

1226
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:32,760
goes to Homer Hickam,

1227
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:36,000
Quentin Wilson, Roy Lee Cook
and Sherman O'Dell,

1228
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:40,000
Big Creek High School,
McDowell County, West Virginia.

1229
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:13,680
Tom Webster of Virginia State
College. I wanna talk to you
about a scholarship.

1230
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:17,720
Jack Palmer, Virginia Tech.
We got the best science program
in the state, buddy, okay?

1231
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:21,600
Congratulations, son.
Good luck to you.

1232
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,680
What did he say to you?
What did who say?

1233
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:32,240
Von Braun.
That was Wernher von Braun.
You just shook his hand.

1234
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:42,600
(Cheering)

1235
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:51,800
Oh, Homer,
I'm so proud of you.
Thanks, Mom.

1236
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:55,080
He's not here, hon.

1237
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:57,480
Where's Miss Riley?

1238
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,240
Hello, Miss Riley.

1239
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:19,960
Hi, Homer.

1240
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:21,880
Hi.
Hi.

1241
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:27,320
Oh!
You did it!

1242
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:30,360
I knew you would.

1243
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:34,200
The Rocket Boys
are goin' to college.

1244
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:36,840
We all got scholarships.
(Chuckling)

1245
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:39,240
And you know what?

1246
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:44,240
From now on,
every school year,

1247
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,640
I'm gonna brag
to all my new students...

1248
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:50,200
about how I taught
Homer Hickam
and the Rocket Boys.

1249
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:52,720
Maybe one day,

1250
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:56,840
one of them'll feel
like they can do
what y'all did.

1251
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,800
You know, just,
stuff like that
takes time.

1252
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,040
Will you let me out?

1253
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:29,160
(John)
What are they doin;
charging Olga for that.

1254
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:31,760
Hell, I'm going to salvage
something up here?

1255
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,760
Hey, Dad. Hi.
Hello, Homer.

1256
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:37,320
I just wanted to tell you
how much I appreciate
what you did for me.

1257
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:41,240
I know it wasn't easy for you,
so thank you.

1258
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:43,880
A-And we're shootin' off
our last rocket today at 5:00,

1259
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:47,360
so if you'd like to come
see it...
I got a lot of work to do.

1260
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:50,600
All right. Well,
I just thought I'd ask.

1261
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:55,560
Hear you met
your big hero.

1262
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:59,880
Didn't even know it.

1263
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:08,200
Look,

1264
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:11,080
I know you and me
don't exactly see eye to eye
on certain things.

1265
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:15,560
I mean,
we don't see eye to eye
on just about anything.

1266
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:20,160
But Dad, I come to believe
that I got it in me to be
somebody in this world.

1267
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:22,920
A-And it's not because
I'm so different
from you either.

1268
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,320
It's 'cause
I'm the same.

1269
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:29,880
You know, I can be
just as hardheaded
and just as tough.

1270
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:34,000
I only hope I can be
as good a man as you are.

1271
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:37,000
I mean, sure,

1272
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:40,480
Dr. Von Braun's
a great scientist,

1273
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:42,880
but he isn't my hero.

1274
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,800
(Elevator Buzzes)

1275
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:46,280
It's our last rocket.
Yeah, let's do it.

1276
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:49,160
Wire it up for me, will ya?
I gotta do something.
Yeah.

1277
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:53,120
Hi, Homer.
Hi.

1278
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:55,920
Congratulations
on winning
the science fair.

1279
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,120
It's gotta be the most
exciting thing that's ever
happened around here.

1280
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:02,280
Um, I was thinking,
Homer, if, if you've
got some time...

1281
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:05,960
Excuse me, Dorothy.
Hi.
Hi.

1282
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:13,240
Good luck.
Thanks.
(Clears Throat)

1283
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:15,680
Hey, everybody, can we have
your attention, please?

1284
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:17,680
Come on, Homer,
let her fly!

1285
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:21,240
We're gonna launch the rocket
in a minute, but we'd like
to say thank you first.

1286
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:25,520
If it wasn't for y'all,
we'd never have gotten
into any science fair.

1287
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,360
We'd probably never have
gotten past blowin' up
my mom's fence.

1288
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,680
(Laughing)
But we did...

1289
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:34,160
because of your help
and support.

1290
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:36,560
And this is for Coalwood.

1291
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:45,000
There are a few people
who believed in us
even before we did.

1292
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:48,480
We'd like to dedicate
this rocket to them.

1293
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:51,000
To Ike Bykovsky.

1294
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:56,720
To Mr. Bolden,
who helped us so much.

1295
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:02,080
To the person
who first inspired us,

1296
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,520
our teacher, Miss Riley.

1297
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:11,560
And, finally, I'd like
to dedicate this rocket
to my mom and to...

1298
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,320
my dad.

1299
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:36,400
You know, it, uh, won't fly
unless somebody pushes
the button.

1300
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:41,560
It's yours,
if you want it.

1301
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:06,800
Ten, nine...
(Together)
Eight,

1302
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:09,360
seven, six, five,

1303
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:13,000
four, three, two, one.

1304
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:32,720
Look at it go, Homer.
