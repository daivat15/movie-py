00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:55,778
- You must forgive me.
- What for?

645
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,222
For intruding on your life.

646
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:01,101
I came of my own accord.

647
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:16,549
You should perhaps go.

648
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,925
No, I'd rather stay.

649
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:21,012

- Not for hours yet.

658
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:25,894
you should come inside now,

659

I was just sitting
a while with Mina.

00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:48,000
Ah! Those tiny flowers are
from the garlic plant.

662

Whatever for?

663
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:55,982
Do you believe in
corporeal transference?

664
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:58,985
- No.
- In materialization?

665
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:03,261
- No.
- And not in astral bodies?

666
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:05,658
What is this to do with Mina?

667
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:08,161
You know the legends
of central Europe

668
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:12,373
of the werewolves and vampires.

669
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,041
Vampires?

670
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:18,572
Creatures who suck the
blood of the living.

671
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:21,313
You aren't saying
that you believe...

672
00:54:21,314 --> 00:54:23,740
- that Mina was attacked by...
- A creature that is dead...

673
00:54:23,741 --> 00:54:26,763
and yet not dead, a thing
that lives after its death

674
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:28,389
- by drinking...
- Oh, no!

675
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,849
It must have blood,

676
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:32,018
- or it dies an agonizing death.
- Please, stop.

678
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:41,258
I wonder if I may?

679
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:46,349
This was to be Mina's

680
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,677
for her birthday.

681
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:53,206
She would want you to have it

682
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:56,310
and to wear it always.

683
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,238
Always.

684
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:38,668
