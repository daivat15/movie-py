1
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,389
<i>Huhh!</i>

2
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,861
<i>Huhh!</i>

3
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:20,496
Get a break, boss?

4
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,999
No break...

5
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,093
Huhh!

6
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,703
<i>Pick up that hammer there, boy.</i>

7
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,080
<i>Yes, sir, boss.</i>

8
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,009
Huhh!

9
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,594
<i>Come on, get it! Go!</i>

10
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:18,595
Huhh!

11
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:23,976
Huhh!

12
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,816
<i>Say...</i>

13
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,027
any of you boys smithies?

14
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,197
Or if not smithies per se...

15
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,408
were you otherwise trained
in the metallurgic arts...

16
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,659
- Aah!
- Before straitened circumstances...

17
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,786
forced you into a life
of aimless wanderin'?

18
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,508
Jesus! Can't I count
on you people?

19
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,469
Sorry, Everett.

20
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,888
Well, all right.

21
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,766
If we take off through
that bayou...

22
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,017
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

23
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,811
Who elected you leader
of this outfit?

24
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,313
Well, Pete, I figured
it should be the one...

25
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,648
with the capacity for
abstract thought.

26
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,650
But if that ain't the
consensus view...

27
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,319
then hell, let's put it to a vote.

28
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,403
Suits me!

29
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,030
I'm votin' for yours truly.

30
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,449
Well, I'm votin' for
yours truly, too.

31
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,957
Okay. I'm with you fellas.

32
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,901
Mind if we join you, old-timer?

33
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,237
Join me, m' son.

34
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,655
Join me.

35
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,828
<i>You work for the
rail road, grandpa?</i>

36
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,247
I work for no man.

37
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,706
<i>Got a name, do you?</i>

38
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,543
I have no name.

39
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,129
Well, that right there
may be the reason...

40
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,506
you've had difficulty
finding gainful employment.

41
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,217
You see, in the mart of
competitive commerce...

42
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,219
You seek a great fortune...

43
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,513
<i>you three who are now in chains.</i>

44
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,850
<i>You will find a fortune...</i>

45
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:18,437
though it will not be
the fortune you seek.

46
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,897
But first...

47
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,191
<i>First you must travel...</i>

48
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:26,987
<i>a long and difficult road...</i>

49
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:31,950
<i>a road fraught with peril. Mm-hmm.</i>

50
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,245
You shall see thangs...

51
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,664
wonderful to tell.

52
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:41,418
You shall see a... a cow...

53
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:46,173
on the roof of a cotton house. Ha.

54
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,719
<i>And, oh, so many startlements.</i>

55
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,055
<i>I cannot tell you how long
this road shall be...</i>

56
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:57,517
<i>but fear not the obstacles
in your path...</i>

57
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,102
<i>for fate has...</i>

58
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,439
<i>vouchsafed your reward.</i>

59
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,484
Though the road may wind...

60
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,278
yea, your hearts grow weary...

61
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,281
still shall ye follow them...

62
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,826
even unto your salvation.

63
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:32,052
<i>No, the treasure's still
there, boys, believe me.</i>

64
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,638
But how'd he know
about the treasure?

65
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,389
I don't know, Delmar.

66
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,808
The blind are reputed to
possess sensitivities...

67
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,602
compensating for their
lack of sight...

68
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,521
even to the point of
developing paranormal...

69
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,939
psychic powers.

70
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,941
Now, clearly, seeing
in the future...

71
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,609
would fall neatly
into that category.

72
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,402
It's not so surprising. Then...

73
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,905
that an organism deprived
of its earthly vision...

74
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,073
He said we wouldn't get it.

75
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,492
He said we wouldn't get
the treasure we seek...

76
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,993
on account of our obstacles.

77
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,370
What the hell does he know?

78
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,996
He's an ignorant old man.

79
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,958
Jesus, Pete. I told you
I buried it myself.

80
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,377
If your cousin still has
this here horse farm...

81
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,337
and a forge and some
shoein' impedimenta...

82
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,672
to restore liberty of movement...

83
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,133
Hold it right there!

84
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,221
You men from the bank?

85
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,681
<i>You Wash's boy?</i>

86
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,349
Yes, sir. Daddy told me...

87
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,810
I'm to shoot who's
ever from the bank.

88
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,437
Well, we ain't from the
bank, young feller.

89
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,022
Yes, sir. I'm also supposed...

90
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,191
to shoot folks servin' papers.

91
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,484
We ain't got no papers. Neither.

92
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,778
I nicked the census man.

93
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,489
<i>Now, there's a good boy.</i>

94
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,825
Is-Is your daddy about?

95
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,047
Hello, Pete.

96
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,383
Who are your friends?

97
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,051
Pleased to make your
acquaintance...

98
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,052
Mr. Hogwallop.

99
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,388
My name's Ulysses
Everett McGill and...

100
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,140
And I'm Delmar O'Donnel.

101
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,685
How you been, Wash?

102
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,938
Been what, 12, 13 years?

103
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,985
Yeah.

104
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:15,447
I expect you want them
chains knocked off.

105
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,867
<i>They foreclosed on Cousin Vester.</i>

106
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,953
<i>He hanged hisself a year come May.</i>

107
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,788
<i>And Uncle Ratliff?</i>

108
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,000
<i>The anthrax took most of his cows.</i>

109
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,418
The rest don't milk.

110
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,463
He lost a boy to mumps.

111
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,882
Where's Cora, Cousin Wash?

112
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,430
Couldn't say.

113
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:47,270
Mrs. Hogwallop up
and R-U-N-N-O-F-T.

114
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,900
She must have been
lookin' for answers.

115
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,193
Possibly.

116
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,445
Good riddance, as far
as I'm concerned.

117
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,490
I do miss her cooking, though.

118
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,949
This stew's awful good.

119
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,284
<i>You think so?</i>

120
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,497
I slaughtered this
horse last Tuesday.

121
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,083
<i>I'm afraid she's startin' to turn.</i>

122
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,487
<i>Well, that winds up tonight's...</i>

123
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,240
Pass the Biscuits Pappy
O'Daniel Flour Hour.

124
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,033
<i>This is Pappy O'Daniel...</i>

125
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,911
<i>hopin' you folks been enjoyin'
that good old-timey music.</i>

126
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,080
<i>And remember...</i>

127
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,873
<i>when you're fixin' to fry
up some flapjacks...</i>

128
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,792
<i>or bake a mess of biscuits...</i>

129
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,836
<i>use cool, clear water...</i>

130
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:56,214
<i>and good, pure Pappy
O'Daniel flour.</i>

131
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,509
Well, guess I'll be turnin' in.

132
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,721
Say, uh, Cousin Wash...

133
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,390
I suppose it'd be the, uh,
acme of foolishness...

134
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,308
to inquire if you had a hair net.

135
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,520
We got a bunch in yon bureau.

136
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,897
Mrs. Hogwallop's, as
a matter of fact.

137
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,608
Help yourself.

138
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,694
I won't be needing 'em.

139
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,166
<i>All right, boys!</i>

140
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,126
Unh. How's my hair?

141
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,837
<i>It's the authorities!</i>

142
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,131
<i>We got you surrounded.</i>

143
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,883
Damn. We're in a tight spot.

144
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,802
<i>Just come on out and grabbin' air!</i>

145
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,180
And don't try nothin' fancy.

146
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,558
Your situation is
pretty nigh hopeless.

147
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,102
Damn! We're in a tight spot!

148
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,520
What in the Sam Hill?

149
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,397
Pete's cousin turned
us in for the bounty.

150
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,899
What the hell are you saying?

151
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,109
Wash is kin!

152
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,277
<i>Sorry, Pete!</i>

153
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:03,072
I know we're kin, but they
got this depression on.

154
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,074
I got to do for me and mine.

155
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,118
I'm gonna kill you...

156
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,621
<i>Judas Iscariot Hogwallop!</i>

157
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,749
<i>- You miserable,
horse-eatin' son of a-</i>

158
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,127
Damn! We're in a tight spot!

159
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,921
Damn his eyes!

160
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:21,049
Pa always said, "Never
trust a Hogwallop."

161
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,761
Come and get us, coppers!

162
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,431
<i>You boys is leavin'
us no choice...</i>

163
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,183
<i>but to smoke you out.</i>

164
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,810
<i>Damn! We're in a tight spot.</i>

165
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,102
Light her up!

166
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,437
<i>Hold up, boys!</i>

167
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,648
<i>Ain't you ever heard
of negotiatin'?</i>

168
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,941
<i>Bet we could talk this thing out.</i>

169
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,317
<i>I hate fire!</i>

170
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,778
<i>You lousy, low-down,
yellow-bellied goat-</i>

171
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,280
<i>Pete, we got to speak
with one voice here.</i>

172
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,782
Careful with that fire, now, boys!

173
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,620
<i>Light the loft, son.</i>

174
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:51,579
Aah!

175
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,164
<i>I hate fire!</i>

176
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:57,585
Gapped-toothed. Carpetbaggin',
motherless spawn of hell!

177
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,630
<i>Step back. Damn it. Look out.</i>

178
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,507
Holy St. Christopher!

179
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,133
Get away from that vehicle, chaps!

180
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,260
She's liquid fire!

181
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:11,057
Take cover, boys!
That ain't popcorn!

182
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,607
<i>Let's get the hell out of here!</i>

183
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,026
Scatter, boys!

184
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,114
<i>Goddamn it!</i>

185
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,161
Get in, boys!

186
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,831
I'm gonna R-U-N-N-O-F-T!

187
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,835
Come on, boys, come on! Come on!

188
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,753
What are you doing here?

189
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,256
<i>You ought to be in
bed, clump snatcher.</i>

190
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,508
You ain't the boss of me!

191
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,686
You candy-butted.
Car-thievin' so-and-so's!

192
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,022
I curse your name!

193
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,941
Go back home and mind your pa!

194
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,322
What's the damn problem?

195
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,492
I can get the part from Bristol.

196
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,494
It'll take 2 weeks.
Here's your pomade.

197
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,871
<i>Two weeks?</i>

198
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,539
That don't do me no good.

199
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,292
Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.

200
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,711
Hold on, now. I don't
want this pomade.

201
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,879
I want Dapper Dan.

202
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,007
I don't carry Dapper Dan.
I carry Fop.

203
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,384
Well, I don't want
Fop, goddamn it!

204
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,178
I'm a Dapper Dan man!

205
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,262
Watch your language, young fella.

206
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,555
This is a public market.

207
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,849
Now, if you want Dapper Dan,
I can order it for you.

208
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,185
Have it in a couple of weeks.

209
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,562
Well, ain't this place
a geographical oddity.

210
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,939
2 weeks from everywhere.

211
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,107
Forget it.

212
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,860
Just a dozen hair nets.

213
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,073
Well, didn't look like
a one-horse town...

214
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,659
but try finding a
decent hair jelly.

215
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:53,743
<i>Gopher, Everett?</i>

216
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,412
And no transmission belt
for 2 weeks neither.

217
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,291
Huh? They dam that
river on the 21 st.

218
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,542
Today is the 17th.

219
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,585
Don't I know it.

220
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,421
We got but 4 days to
get to that treasure.

221
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,925
After that, it'll be at
the bottom of a lake.

222
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,593
We ain't gonna make it walkin'.

223
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:11,719
<i>That's right.</i>

224
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:12,887
Gopher, Everett?

225
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,932
But the old tactician
has got a plan.

226
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,100
For the transportation, that is.

227
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,560
I don't know how I'm gonna
keep my coiffure in order.

228
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:22,897
How's this a plan? How
we gonna get a car?

229
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,608
Sell that. I figure
you can only have...

230
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,610
painful association for Wash.

231
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:32,365
"To Washington
Bartholomew Hogwallop."

232
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,075
<i>From his lovin' Cora.</i>

233
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:38,913
<i>"Amor Fidel... is."</i>

234
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,289
<i>It was in his bureau.</i>

235
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,916
<i>I reckon it'll fetch
us enough cash...</i>

236
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,209
<i>for a good used auto voiture...</i>

237
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,253
<i>and a little leftover besides.</i>

238
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,964
Whoo! You got some light
fingers, Everett.

239
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,007
Gopher?

240
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,968
You miserable little snake.

241
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,970
You stole from my kin!

242
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,764
Who was fixin' to betray us.

243
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,017
You didn't know that at the time.

244
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,269
So I borrowed it till I did know.

245
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,479
That don't make no sense!

246
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,148
Pete, it's a fool who
looks for logic...

247
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,733
in the chambers of
the human heart.

248
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,610
What the hell is that singing?

249
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:17,285
Appears to be some kind of a...
congregation.

250
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,413
Care for some gopher?

251
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,377
No, thank you, Delmar.

252
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,047
A third of a gopher would
only arouse my appetite...

253
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,591
without beddin' her back down.

254
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,177
Oh, you can have the whole thing.

255
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,262
Me and Pete already had one.

256
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:44,020
We ran across a whole
gopher village.

257
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,435
Well, I guess hard times
flush the chumps.

258
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,563
Everybody's lookin' for answers.

259
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,110
Where the hell's he going?

260
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:18,322
The Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost.

261
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,750
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.

262
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,961
Delmar's been saved.

263
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,173
Well, that's it, boys.
I been redeemed.

264
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,091
The preacher done washed away...

265
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,844
all my sins and transgressions.

266
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,513
It's the straight and
narrow from here on out.

267
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,474
And heaven everlasting's
my reward.

268
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:46,976
Delmar, what are
you talkin' about?

269
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,519
We got bigger fish to fry.

270
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:52,148
The preacher said all my
sins is washed away...

271
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,443
including that Piggly Wiggly
I knocked over in Yazoo.

272
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,653
I thought you said you was
innocent of those charges.

273
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,156
Well, I was lyin'.

274
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,657
And the preacher said...

275
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:04,160
that that sin's been
washed away, too.

276
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,788
<i>Neither God, nor man's
got nothin' on me now.</i>

277
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:11,292
Come on in, boys.
The water is fine.

278
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,301
<i>Come on, boy. There, boy.</i>

279
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,677
<i>Good doggy.</i>

280
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,015
<i>All right, boys, we got the scent.</i>

281
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,021
The preacher said it absolved us.

282
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,398
For him. Not for the law.

283
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,524
I'm surprised at you, Pete.

284
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,401
I gave you credit for
more brains than Delmar.

285
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,987
But there was witnesses
seen us redeemed.

286
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,697
That's not the issue, Delmar.

287
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,366
Even if it did put you
square with the Lord...

288
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,201
the state of Mississippi's
a little more hard-nosed.

289
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,286
You should have
joined us, Everett.

290
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,871
It couldn't have hurt none.

291
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,331
Hell, at least it would
have washed away...

292
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,541
the stink of that pomade.

293
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,252
Joining you two ignorant fools...

294
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,378
in a ridiculous superstition...

295
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,420
Thank you, anyway.

296
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,297
And I like the smell
of my hair treatment.

297
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,341
The pleasin' odor's
half the point.

298
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,136
Baptism!

299
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,639
You two are just dumber
than a bag of hammers.

300
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,683
Well, I guess you're
just my cross to bear.

301
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,059
Pull over, Everett.

302
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,228
<i>Let's give that
colored boy a lift.</i>

303
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,238
<i>You folks going past Tishomingo?</i>

304
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,823
Sure, hop in.

305
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,126
<i>How you doin', son?
Name's Everett.</i>

306
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,711
These two soggy sons of bitches...

307
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,379
are Pete and Delmar.

308
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,381
<i>Keep your fingers away
from Pete's mouth.</i>

309
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,924
He ain't had nothing
to eat for 13 years...

310
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,927
except prison food, gopher,
and a little greasy horse.

311
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,762
Thanks for the lift, sir.

312
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,140
My name's Tommy. Tommy Johnson.

313
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,267
How you doin', Tommy?

314
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:54,603
Say, I haven't seen a
house out here for miles.

315
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,315
What are you doin' out in
the middle of nowhere?

316
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,276
Well, I had to be at that there
crossroads last midnight.

317
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,819
Sell my soul to the devil.

318
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,487
<i>Well, ain't it a small world?</i>

319
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,114
Spiritually speakin'.

320
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,783
Pete and Delmar just
been baptized and saved.

321
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,994
I guess I'm the only one
that remains unaffiliated.

322
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,954
<i>This ain't no laughin'
matter, Everett.</i>

323
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,956
What'd the devil give you
for your soul, Tommy?

324
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:17,335
Well, he taught me to play
this here guitar real good.

325
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,711
Oh, son...

326
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:22,256
for that you traded
your everlasting soul?

327
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,841
Well, I wasn't usin' it.

328
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:28,262
I've always wondered.
What's the devil look like?

329
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,972
Well, of course, there
are all manner...

330
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,016
of lesser imps and demons, Pete...

331
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,476
but the great Satan hisself...

332
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,770
is red and scaly with
a bifurcated tail...

333
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:36,979
and he carries a hay fork.

334
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,648
<i>Oh, no. No, sir.</i>

335
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:43,319
He's white. As white as you folks.

336
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,447
With empty eyes and a big.
Hollow voice.

337
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,325
He loved to travel around
with a mean old hound.

338
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,326
That's right.

339
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,536
And he told you to
go to Tishomingo?

340
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,664
Well, no, sir. Why,
that was my idea.

341
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,541
I heard there's a man down there.

342
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,336
He pays folks money
to sing into his can.

343
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,213
<i>They say he pays extra...</i>

344
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,423
<i>if'n you play real good.</i>

345
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,509
Tishomingo, huh?

346
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,469
How much he pay?

347
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:27,780
All right. Boys, follow my lead.

348
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,745
Hello?

349
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,165
<i>Who's the honcho around here?</i>

350
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,001
I am. Who are you?

351
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,962
<i>Well, sir, I'm Jordan Rivers...</i>

352
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,965
and these here are the
Soggy Bottom Boys...

353
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,550
out of Cottonelia, Mississippi.

354
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,052
Songs of salvation
to salve the soul.

355
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,888
Uh, we hear that you
pay good money...

356
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,390
to sing into a can.

357
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,724
Well, that all depends.

358
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,893
You boys do Negro songs?

359
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:03,023
Um... well, uh, sir,
we are Negroes.

360
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,859
All except for our
accomp-our accomp...

361
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,278
Uh, the fella that
plays the guitar.

362
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,738
Yeah, well. I don't
record Negro songs.

363
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,908
<i>No, I'm lookin' for some
old-timey material.</i>

364
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,578
You see, people can't seem
to get enough of it...

365
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,204
since we started
broadcasting it...

366
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,373
<i>on The Pappy O'Daniel
Flour Hour...</i>

367
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,834
so thank you for stopping by.
But...

368
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,752
<i>Sir, uh, the Soggy Bottom Boys...</i>

369
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,964
have been steeped in
old-timey material.

370
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,883
Heck, we're silly with
it, ain't we, boys?

371
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:29,925
That's right.

372
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,760
That's right. We ain't
really Negroes.

373
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:34,555
All except for our accompanist.

374
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,996
Whoo! Hot damn. Son!

375
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,998
I believe you did sell
your soul to the devil!

376
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,332
Whoo-ee!

377
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,420
Boy, that was some mighty
fine a-pickin' and a-singin'.

378
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,005
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>

379
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,465
Ahem. You come on in here, you...

380
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,967
You sign these papers here.

381
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:38,220
I'm gonna give you $10 apiece.

382
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:42,600
Uh, uh, okay, sir, but
Mert and, uh, uh...

383
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,727
Aloysious'll just have to sign Xs.

384
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:47,271
Only 4 of us can write.

385
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,522
<i>That'd be fine.</i>

386
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,441
Ha ha!

387
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,692
Whoo!

388
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,402
Hey, mister, I don't mean...

389
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,237
to be tellin' tales
out of school...

390
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,656
but there's a fella in there
who'll pay you $10...

391
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,366
<i>if you sing into his can.</i>

392
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:02,578
I'm not here to make a record.
You dumb cracker.

393
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,580
They broadcast me
out on the radio.

394
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,206
That's Governor Menelaus...

395
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,375
<i>"Pass the Biscuits"
Pappy O'Daniel.</i>

396
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,919
<i>And he'd sure appreciate it
if you ate his farina...</i>

397
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,421
and voted him a second term.

398
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,797
Finest governor we ever
had in Mississippi.

399
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,132
<i>In any state.</i>

400
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,592
<i>Oh, Lord, yes. Every
parish or precinct.</i>

401
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,719
<i>He was makin' the bigger point.</i>

402
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,429
Well, ain't you gonna
press the flesh, Pappy?

403
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,597
Do a little politicking?

404
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,099
I'll press your flesh,
you dimwitted sumbitch.

405
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,602
<i>You don't tell your pappy how
to court the electorate.</i>

406
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,228
<i>We ain't one-at-a-timin' here.</i>

407
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,105
We're mass communicatin'!

408
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,149
Oh, yes. That's a
powerful new force.

409
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,150
Mm-hmm!

410
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,610
Shake a leg, Junior.

411
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,737
Thank God your mammy
died givin' birth.

412
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,781
If she'd have seen you,
she'd have died of shame.

413
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,158
Well, hi there! How you doin'?

414
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:46,140
Let's bed down here for the night.

415
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:50,018
Yeah, it stinks in that old barn.

416
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,520
Suits me.

417
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,188
Pretty soon it'll be nothin'

418
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:57,860
but featherbeds and silk sheets.

419
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,740
Million dollars.

420
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,908
Million-point-two.

421
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:08,036
<i>500,000 each.</i>

422
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,913
<i>400, Delmar.</i>

423
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:13,709
Pete, what are you gonna do...

424
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,003
with your share of the treasure?

425
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:19,548
Go out west somewhere.

426
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:22,009
Open a fine restaurant.

427
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:27,014
I'm gonna be the maitre d'.

428
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,892
Greet all the swells.

429
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:33,479
Go to work every day
in a bow tie...

430
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,773
tuxedo.

431
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,568
And all the staff say
"Yes, sir" and...

432
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,111
"No, sir..."

433
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,863
and "In a jiffy, Pete."

434
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,826
And all my meals for free.

435
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,916
What about you, Delmar?

436
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:57,419
<i>What are you gonna do with
your share of that dough?</i>

437
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:01,298
I'm gonna visit them
foreclosin' son of a guns...

438
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:05,177
down at the Indianola
Savings and Loan.

439
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,554
Slap that money on
the barrel head...

440
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,765
and buy back the family farm.

441
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:15,145
You ain't no kind of man
if you ain't got land.

442
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,398
<i>What about you, Everett?</i>

443
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:19,942
What you have in mind...

444
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:22,444
when you stole it
in the first place?

445
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:26,281
I...

446
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,951
didn't have no plan.

447
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:32,204
Well, that hardly sound like you.

448
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:35,624
<i>All right, boys! It's
the authorities!</i>

449
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,460
<i>Your situation is
purty nigh hopeless!</i>

450
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,004
Damn. They found our car.

451
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,798
<i>We ain't got the time...</i>

452
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,466
<i>and nary the inclination...</i>

453
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:47,135
<i>to chat with you boys any further.</i>

454
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,471
Damn. We got to skedaddle.

455
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:52,391
I left my pomade in the car.

456
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,809
Maybe I can creep up.

457
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:54,935
Don't be a fool, Everett.

458
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,313
We got to R-U-N-N-O-F-T.

459
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:00,440
<i>Where's Tommy?</i>

460
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,109
Already lit out.

461
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,236
<i>Scared out of his wits.</i>

462
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,031
Let's go!

463
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,160
Well, hell, it ain't square one.

464
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:13,996
Ain't no one gonna pick up...

465
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,456
3 filthy, unshaved hitchhikers.

466
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:17,749
And one of them a know-it-all...

467
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,711
who can't keep his trap shut.

468
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,880
Pete, the personal rancor
reflected in that remark...

469
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,215
I don't intend to
dignify with comment.

470
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,593
But I would like to address
your general attitude...

471
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,636
of hopeless negativism.

472
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:32,681
Consider the lilies
of the goddamn field.

473
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,016
Or, hell, take a look
at Delmar here...

474
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,893
as your paradigm of hope.

475
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,811
Yeah. Look at me.

476
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,188
Now, you may call it an
unreasoning optimism.

477
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,982
You may call it obtuse...

478
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,444
but the plain and simple fact
is that we got close to...

479
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,196
3 days before they...

480
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,579
<i>dam that river.</i>

481
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,521
Is this a road to Itta Bena?

482
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,193
Uh... Itta Bena?

483
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,028
Itta Bena?

484
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,405
Isn't that... Isn't that, uh...

485
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,573
Stay on this here road.

486
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:32,574
Nah, that ain't right.

487
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,368
I was thinking of. uh...

488
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:35,369
Take this road...

489
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,912
Nah, nah, nah. That ain't right.

490
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,289
<i>It seems to me there's a road-</i>

491
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,250
cow road that used to
lead all the way...

492
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,127
<i>Well, most of the way.</i>

493
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,879
<i>That ain't right, either.</i>

494
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,798
Hop on in while you
give it a think.

495
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,342
Right. Delmar.

496
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,144
<i>Any of you boys know your way...</i>

497
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,105
around a Walther P.P.K.?

498
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,232
Well, see, that's where
we can't help you.

499
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,109
I don't believe it's
in Mississippi.

500
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,739
Friend, some of your folding
money has come unstowed.

501
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:15,742
<i>Just stuff it down that
sack there, will you?</i>

502
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,078
You boys aren't bad
men, I take it?

503
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,455
Well, it's funny you should ask.

504
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,624
I was bad till yesterday...

505
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,793
but me and Pete here been saved.

506
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,963
<i>I'm Delmar, and that
there is Everett.</i>

507
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,297
George Nelson.

508
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,757
It's a pleasure.

509
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,927
Grab the tiller, will you, buddy?

510
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,644
Hand me that chopper. Ha ha ha ha!

511
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:45,939
Say, what line of
work you in, George?

512
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,941
Ha ha ha ha!

513
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,609
Come and get me, coppers!

514
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:54,114
You flatfooted, lame-brained,
soft-ass sons of bitches!

515
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,699
Ah ha ha ha ha!

516
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,576
No one can catch me!

517
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,327
<i>I'm George Nelson!</i>

518
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:02,205
I'm bigger than any
John, live or limp!

519
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,294
I'm 101/2 feet tall!

520
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:10,964
<i>Cows.</i>

521
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:14,342
I hate cows worse than coppers!

522
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,181
<i>Oh, George. Not the livestock.</i>

523
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:22,517
Come on, you miserable,
salaried sons of bitches!

524
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:23,685
<i>Come and get me!</i>

525
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,246
Come on, boys, we're
going for the record.

526
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,998
3 banks in 2 hours!

527
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,801
Okay. Folks, hold the applause
and drop your drawers.

528
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,385
I'm George Nelson...

529
00:34:57,553 --> 00:35:00,013
and I'm here to sack
the city Itta Bena!

530
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,183
He's a live wire, though.
Ain't he?

531
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,060
<i>All the money in a bag.</i>

532
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,228
<i>What are you lookin' at, grandpa?</i>

533
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,021
Pardon me, George...

534
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,898
you got a plan for
gettin' out of here?

535
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,900
Sure, boys.

536
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:14,903
Here's my plan. Ha ha ha ha!

537
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,197
<i>They ain't never seen
ordnance like this!</i>

538
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,282
Thank you, folks.

539
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,701
And remember, Jesus saves...

540
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,913
but George Nelson withdraws!
Ha ha ha ha!

541
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,748
Go fix the auto voiture, Pete.

542
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,209
Is that Babyface Nelson?

543
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,878
Who said that?

544
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:37,259
<i>What ignorant,
lowdown, slanderizin'</i>

545
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,386
<i>son of a bitch said that?</i>

546
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:45,475
My name is George Nelson. Get me?

547
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:49,020
She didn't mean nothin'
by it, George.

548
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,730
George Nelson!

549
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,315
Not Babyface!

550
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,442
You remember!

551
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,653
And you tell your friends!

552
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,406
<i>I'm George Nelson.</i>

553
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,158
Born to raise hell.

554
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:22,888
Well, that was some fun.
Now, wasn't it, George?

555
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,014
Yeah.

556
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,142
Almost makes me wished I
hadn't have been saved.

557
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,977
Jacking up banks.

558
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,646
I can see how a fella'd derive
a whole lot of pleasure...

559
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,690
and satisfaction out of it.

560
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,151
It's okay.

561
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,611
<i>Hoo, dawgies!</i>

562
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,617
Well...

563
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,829
I'm takin' off.

564
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,835
You boys might as well...

565
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:57,172
keep my... share of the riches.

566
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:01,676
<i>Well, where are you going, George?</i>

567
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:04,763
I don't know.

568
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,389
Who cares?

569
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,312
Now, what do you suppose
is eatin' George?

570
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,147
Well, Delmar...

571
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:17,192
they say that with the
thrill-seeking personality...

572
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,027
<i>What goes up must come down.</i>

573
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:22,656
<i>On top of the world one minute,
haunted by meekness the next.</i>

574
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,575
<i>Yes, sir, it's as if our
old friend, George...</i>

575
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,328
is a alley cat and his
own damn humors...

576
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,705
are swingin' him by the tail.

577
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,082
<i>I wouldn't worry, Delmar.</i>

578
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,709
<i>He'll be back on top again.</i>

579
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:40,048
<i>I don't think we've seen
the last of George Nelson.</i>

580
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,486
Don't be saps for Pappy.

581
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:04,155
Homer Stokes for governor.

582
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,283
Let's sweep this state clean.

583
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,160
Vote for Stokes, brother.

584
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,217
Aw, shh shh. Hang on!

585
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,303
I'm gonna slap one on here.

586
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,972
Folks, here's my
cousin Ezra's niece...

587
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,475
Eudora from out of Greenwood,
doin' a little number...

588
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,144
with her cousin Tom-Tom...

589
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,814
which I predict you
gonna enjoy thoroughly.

590
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:46,323
Now, what can I do
you for, Mr. French?

591
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,701
How can I lay ahold of
them Soggy Bottom Boys?

592
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:50,952
Soggy Bottom.

593
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,455
I don't precisely recollect them.

594
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,623
They cut a record in
here a few days ago...

595
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,208
with an old-timey harmony thing...

596
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,544
with a guitar
accompany-accompany...

597
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,797
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I remember them.

598
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,841
Colored fellas, I believe.

599
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,594
Yes, sir, they a
fine bunch of boys.

600
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,805
They sang into yonder
can, then skedaddled.

601
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:11,973
Well, that record...

602
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:15,310
is just goin' through
the goddamn roof.

603
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:16,936
They playin' it as
far away as Mobile.

604
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:17,979
No.

605
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,023
Whole damn state's goin' apey.

606
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,526
Well, it was a powerful air.

607
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,028
Hot damn. We got to
find them boys...

608
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,322
and sign 'em to a
big fat contract.

609
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,657
Hell's bells, Mr. Lund,
if we don't...

610
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,451
the goddamn competition will.

611
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,996
Oh, mercy, yes, we got to
beat that competition.

612
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,664
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

613
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,963
Delmar. Over here.

614
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,599
Do you have the Soggy
Bottom Boys...

615
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,809
performing "Man of
Constant Sorrow"?

616
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,479
No, ma'am. We got a new
shipment in yesterday.

617
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:26,399
Sorry, but we just can't
keep 'em on our shelves.

618
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,157
How are you?

619
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:21,496
Delmar, come on. Go. Go.

620
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,355
Shut up, Delmar.

621
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:55,738
Uhh! Ohh!

622
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,324
Pull over! Pull over!

623
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,126
Guess old Pete's got the itch.

624
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,108
Howdy do, ladies?

625
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,943
Name of Pete.

626
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,082
Ain't you gonna
introduce us, Pete?

627
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,500
I don't know their names.

628
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,419
I seen 'em first!

629
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,166
<i>Ladies, my name is Ulysses
Everett McGill...</i>

630
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:34,712
and, well, you three
ladies are about the...

631
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,922
the prettiest...

632
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,431
water lilies, uh...

633
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,228
Corn liquor.

634
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:27,617
Everett.

635
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,368
My hair!

636
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,413
Look at this.

637
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,554
Pete!

638
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:51,098
Where the heck are you?

639
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:52,183
Pete!

640
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:56,229
We ain't got time
for hide-and-seek!

641
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,441
<i>Now, we ain't got time
for your shenanigans!</i>

642
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:03,778
Sweet Jesus, Everett.

643
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,363
They left his heart.

644
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:30,304
Aah! Aah!

645
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:32,473
What the-Delmar, what the
heck's got into you?

646
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,183
<i>Can't you see it, Everett?</i>

647
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,978
Them sirens did this to Pete.

648
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:38,688
They loved him up...

649
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:42,275
and turned him into a...
horny toad.

650
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,490
Pete!

651
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:52,159
Pete! Pete!

652
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:52,827
Pete!

653
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:11,345
Pete, it's me-Delmar.

654
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:13,514
It's me-Delmar.

655
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,017
<i>Everett.</i>

656
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,143
Delmar, what the...

657
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,521
What are we gonna do?

658
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,909
I'm not sure that's Pete.

659
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:36,370
Of course it's Pete. Look at him.

660
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:41,083
We got to find some kind of...
wizard can change him back.

661
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,589
I'm just not sure that's Pete.

662
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:52,136
<i>You can't display a toad...</i>

663
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:53,554
<i>in a fine restaurant like this.</i>

664
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:55,556
<i>Why, the good folks here'd
go right off their feed.</i>

665
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,309
Hey. I just don't
think it's right...

666
00:48:58,477 --> 00:48:59,644
keeping him under wraps...

667
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:01,270
like we was ashamed of him.

668
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,564
Well, if it is Pete,
I am ashamed of him.

669
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,232
The way I see it, he
got what he deserved.

670
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,069
Fornicating with some
whore of Babylon.

671
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:10,196
These things don't happen
for no reason, Delmar.

672
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,698
It's obviously some kind of
judgment on Pete's character.

673
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,992
Well, the two of us was
fixin' to fornicate.

674
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:20,206
You're gonna have to excuse
my rusticated friend...

675
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,793
unaccustomed as he
is to city manners.

676
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,086
Hmm?

677
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:27,380
<i>I guess we'll have ourselves...</i>

678
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:28,589
<i>a couple of steaks...</i>

679
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,800
<i>and some, uh, gratine potatoes...</i>

680
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,469
<i>and wash it down with some
of your finest bubbly wine.</i>

681
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,055
Oh, and I don't suppose
you have any...

682
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,476
Maybe the chef could prepare...

683
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,563
Just bring us a couple of
leaves of raw cabbage.

684
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:45,564
Yes, sir.

685
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:46,565
Thank you.

686
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:47,817
That kind of barnyard language...

687
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,527
I don't believe I've seen you
boys around here before.

688
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:50,945
Allow me to introduce myself.

689
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,488
Name of Daniel Teague...

690
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:55,157
known in these precincts
as Big Dan Teague...

691
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,784
<i>Or to those who are
pressed for time-</i>

692
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:57,952
Big Dan tout court!

693
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,495
<i>How you doin', Big Dan?</i>

694
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:00,955
My name's Ulysses Everett McGill.

695
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,541
This is my associate
Delmar O'Donnel.

696
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:04,834
I detect, like me...

697
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,752
you're endowed with
the gift of gab.

698
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,504
I flatter myself that
such is the case.

699
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,923
In my line of work,
it's plumb necessary.

700
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,925
The one thing you don't want...

701
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,138
<i>is air in the conversation.</i>

702
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:18,931
Once again we find
ourselves in agreement.

703
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,641
What kind of work you do, Big Dan?

704
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:23,144
Sales, Mr. McGill. Sales!
And what do I sell?

705
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:25,479
The truth, every
blessed word of it.

706
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:27,648
From Genesis on down
to Revelations.

707
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,150
That's right, the Word of God...

708
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:32,403
which, let me tell you, there
is damn good money in...

709
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,780
during these times
of woe and want.

710
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,323
People are lookin' for answers...

711
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:39,160
and Big Dan sells the
only book that's got 'em.

712
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:40,536
And what do you do...

713
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:44,040
you and your, uh,
tongue-tied friend?

714
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,459
We, uh...

715
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,294
we're adventurers, sir.

716
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,171
<i>Currently pursuing a
certain opportunity...</i>

717
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,339
but we're open to others as well.

718
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:53,674
I like your style, young man...

719
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,593
so I'm gonna propose
you a proposition.

720
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,304
You cover my bill, so I don't
have to run back upstairs...

721
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,389
get your waitress to wrap
your dinner picnic-style...

722
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:03,184
<i>And we shall retire to
more private environs...</i>

723
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:06,187
where I will tell you how there
are vast amounts of money...

724
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,189
to be made in the service
of God almighty.

725
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:10,107
Well, why not? If nothin' else...

726
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:12,193
I can use some civilized
conversation.

727
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,779
Don't forget your
shoe box, friend.

728
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,030
Languishin'!

729
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,240
Goddamn campaign is languishin'!

730
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,909
<i>We need a shot in the arm.</i>

731
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,995
<i>You hear me, boys?
In the goddamn arm!</i>

732
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,121
Election held tomorrow...

733
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:26,624
that son of bitch Stokes
would win it in a walk!

734
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:30,669
Well, he's the reform
candidate, Daddy.

735
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:31,670
Yeah?

736
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,672
A lot of people like that reform.

737
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,467
Maybe we should get us some.

738
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,553
I'll reform you, you
soft-headed son of a bitch.

739
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:42,264
How we gonna run reform when
we're the damn incumbent?

740
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,517
Is that the best idea you
boys can come up with?

741
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:45,726
<i>Reform?!</i>

742
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,853
Weepin' Jesus on the cross.

743
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,230
That's it!

744
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:53,192
You may as well start drafting
my concession speech right now.

745
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,402
Okay. Pappy.

746
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,780
I'm just making a point.
You stupid son of a bitch.

747
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,990
Give me back that hat! Hurry up!

748
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,242
Pappy's just makin' a point.

749
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:02,493
Shut up!

750
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,512
Thank you, boys, for
throwing in that fricassee.

751
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,013
I'm a man of large appetites...

752
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:24,306
and even with lunch
under my belt...

753
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,267
I was feeling a mite peckish.

754
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:27,518
It's our pleasure, Big Dan.

755
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:31,313
Thank you as well for the
conversational hiatus.

756
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:34,191
I generally refrain from
speech during gustation.

757
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:36,861
There are those who attempt
both at the same time.

758
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:39,780
I find it coarse and vulgar.

759
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,031
Where were we?

760
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,117
Making money in the
Lord's service.

761
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,119
You don't say much. Friend,
but when you do...

762
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:46,829
it's to the point and
I salute you for it.

763
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,873
<i>Yes, Bible sales.</i>

764
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,625
Now, the trade is not
a complicated one.

765
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,377
There are but 2 things to learn...

766
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,212
<i>One being where to
find a wholesaler...</i>

767
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,047
the Word of God in
bulk, as it were.

768
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,675
Two-how to recognize
your customer.

769
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,218
Who are you dealing with?

770
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:04,513
It's an exercise in
psychology, so to speak.

771
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:07,683
And it is that which I propose...

772
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,145
to give you a lesson in right now.

773
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,315
Why, I like to think I'm a
pretty astute observer...

774
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:16,400
of the human scene, too, Big Dan.

775
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:18,068
No doubt, brother.

776
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:19,695
I figured as much back
at the restaurant.

777
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:22,698
That's why I invited
you all out here...

778
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,700
for this advanced tutorial.

779
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,744
Unh!

780
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:27,912
What's going on, Big Dan?

781
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,079
It's all about the money, boys!

782
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:31,123
<i>That's it!</i>

783
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:36,086
Gol... durned... money!

784
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,254
I don't get it, Big Dan.

785
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:39,131
Raah!

786
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:44,220
I just take your show cards.

787
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:45,721
Yaah!

788
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,688
And whatever you got in the hole.

789
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,612
What the...

790
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,156
there ain't nothin'
but a damn toad.

791
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:07,368
No, you don't understand.

792
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:08,577
That's Pete.

793
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,291
Pete.

794
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:18,003
You know these things
give you warts?

795
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,096
End of lesson.

796
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,767
So long, boys. Hee hee hee.

797
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,603
See you in the funny papers.

798
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,439
Y'all seen the end
of Big Dan Teague.

799
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,339
<i>Where are they?</i>

800
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:06,510
Talk, you unreconstructed
whelp of a whore!

801
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:07,678
Where they headed?

802
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,388
<i>Aah!</i>

803
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,849
<i>Your screams ain't gonna
save your flesh...</i>

804
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,350
Aah!

805
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:15,102
<i>Only your tongue is, boy.
Where they headed?</i>

806
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,354
Aah!

807
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,035
Lump, I.O.

808
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:41,962
Sweet summer rain.

809
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:46,717
Like God's own mercy.

810
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,971
Your two friends have
abandoned you, Pete.

811
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:54,516
<i>They don't seem to
care about your hide.</i>

812
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,190
Okay.

813
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,739
<i>Stairway to heaven.</i>

814
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,911
We shall all meet by-and-by.

815
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,789
Goddamn it!

816
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:20,417
God forgive me!

817
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,086
Hold.

818
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:37,559
Believe me. Delmar, he would
have wanted us to press on.

819
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:40,604
Pete, rest his soul...

820
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:42,606
was one sour ass son of a bitch...

821
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,484
and not given to acts of
pointless sentimentality.

822
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:46,610
It just don't seem right...

823
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,737
digging up that
treasure without him.

824
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,739
Maybe it's for the
best he was squished.

825
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,658
Why, he...

826
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,619
was barely a sentient being and...

827
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,454
well, as soon as we get
ourselves cleaned up...

828
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,206
and we get a little
smellum in our hair...

829
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:02,292
why, we're gonna feel 100%
better about ourselves...

830
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:05,462
and about... life in general.

831
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,591
Must be near Parchman Farm.

832
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:12,719
Sorry sons of bitches.

833
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:16,515
<i>Seems like a year ago
we busted off the farm.</i>

834
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,526
Pete got a brother?

835
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:30,237
Not that I'm aware.

836
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,409
Heat must be getting to me.

837
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:32,966
That was wonderful. That sure was.

838
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:34,134
Yes.

839
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:37,638
Now, I know the Sunnysiders
would agree with me...

840
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:40,224
when I say the great
state of Mississippi...

841
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:44,394
cannot afford 4 more
years of Pappy O'Daniel!

842
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:47,356
4 more years of cronyism!

843
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:50,526
Nepotism! Rascalism!

844
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:53,570
Of service to the interests!

845
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:57,991
Now, the choice,
she's a clear 'un.

846
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:01,537
Pappy O'Daniel, slave
of the interests.

847
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:05,082
Homer Stokes, servant
of the little man.

848
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,250
Ain't that right, little fella?

849
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:07,709
He ain't lyin'!

850
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:11,922
Ladies and gentlemen. The
little man has admonished me...

851
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,550
to grasp the broom of reform...

852
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:17,344
and sweep this state clean!

853
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:21,098
It's gonna be, "Back to
the flour mill, Pappy!"

854
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,267
The interests can take
care of themselves!"

855
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:24,768
<i>come Tuesday...</i>

856
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:27,646
<i>we're gonna sweep the rascals out!</i>

857
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:33,443
<i>Clean government is
yours for the asking!</i>

858
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:38,365
<i>Folks, now the
little Wharvey gals!</i>

859
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:42,077
Wharvey gals?

860
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,371
Did he just say
little Wharvey gals?

861
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:47,124
Come here, girls.

862
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,709
What y'all gonna sing for us?

863
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:50,961
"In the highways."

864
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:53,046
Goddamn it all!

865
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:54,298
You know them gals, Everett?

866
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:31,251
Hey, girls!

867
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:33,795
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

868
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,131
Ha ha ha!

869
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,342
Daddy? He ain't our daddy.

870
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:40,093
Hell, I ain't. What's
this Wharvey gals?

871
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:41,261
Your name's McGill.

872
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:44,181
No, sir. Not since you
got hit by that train.

873
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:46,433
What are you talking about?
I wasn't hit by any train.

874
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:48,060
Mama says you was hit by a train.

875
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:50,187
- Blooey!
- Nothin' left.

876
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:52,147
Just a grease spot on the L & N.

877
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:54,608
Damn it, I wasn't
hit by any train!

878
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:56,777
That's why Mama's got
us back to Wharvey.

879
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:58,362
That's her maiden name.

880
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:00,072
You got a maiden name, Daddy?

881
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:02,407
No, Daddy don't have a maiden name.
See...

882
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:03,867
<i>That's your misfortune.</i>

883
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:06,203
That's right, and now
Mama's got a new beau.

884
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:07,704
He's a suitor.

885
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:09,665
Yeah, I heard about that.

886
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:13,001
<i>Mama says he's bona fide.</i>

887
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,336
Mmm.

888
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:15,837
He give her a ring?

889
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,339
Yes, sir. A big 'un.

890
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:20,092
- Gotta gem.
- Mama checked it.

891
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:21,426
It's bona fide.

892
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:22,469
He's a suitor.

893
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:23,512
What's his name?

894
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,180
Vernon T. Waldrip.

895
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:26,181
Uncle Vernon.

896
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,432
Till tomorrow.

897
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,725
Then he's gonna be Daddy.

898
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:30,852
I am the only daddy you got.

899
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,479
<i>I am the damn paterfamilias.</i>

900
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,523
But you ain't bona fide.

901
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:39,611
Where's your mama?

902
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,238
She's at the five-and-dime.

903
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:42,531
Buying nipples.

904
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:00,507
Daddy!

905
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:03,552
Hello, sugar! Ha ha!

906
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,554
<i>How's my little girl?</i>

907
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,389
<i>Hi.</i>

908
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:08,598
Who the hell's that?

909
01:02:08,766 --> 01:02:10,100
Starla Wharvey.

910
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:12,269
Starla McGill, you mean.

911
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:13,812
How come you never
told me about her?

912
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,272
'Cause you was hit by a train.

913
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,440
That's another thing.

914
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:18,066
Why are you telling our
gals I was hit by a train?

915
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,068
Lots of respectable people
been hit by trains.

916
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:22,988
Judge Hobby over in Cookville
was hit by a train.

917
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:24,406
What was I supposed to tell 'em...

918
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:25,907
that you were sent
to the penal farm...

919
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,784
and I divorced you from shame?

920
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:29,286
I take your point.

921
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:30,954
But it does put me in a
damned awkward position...

922
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,539
vis à vis my progeny.

923
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:33,623
<i>Hello, Penny.</i>

924
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:37,169
Is this gentlemen bothering you?

925
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,381
You Waldrip?

926
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:43,842
Uh-huh. That's right.

927
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:46,428
Hmm.

928
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:59,649
You been using my hair treatment?

929
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:01,985
Your hair treatment?

930
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:03,945
Excuse me.

931
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,034
I got news for you.

932
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,328
In case you hadn't noticed.
I wasn't hit by a train...

933
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,955
and I have traveled
many a weary mile...

934
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:18,960
to be back with my wife
and my 6 daughters.

935
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:20,712
<i>Seven, Daddy!</i>

936
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,380
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle.

937
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:23,673
Your daddy was hit by a train.

938
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:25,342
Penny, you stop that!

939
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,469
No, you stop it! Vernon
here's got a job.

940
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,679
Vernon's got prospects.
He's bona fide.

941
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:30,889
What are you?

942
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,891
I'll tell you what I am...

943
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:36,102
<i>I am the paterfamilias,
and you can't marry him!</i>

944
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:39,231
I can, I am, and I will. Tomorrow.

945
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:40,941
I got to think about the
little Wharvey gals.

946
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:42,317
They look to me for answers.

947
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,402
Vernon can support 'em...

948
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:45,862
and buy 'em lessons
on the clarinet.

949
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:47,239
The only good thing you
ever did for the gals...

950
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:48,824
was get hit by that train!

951
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:54,287
Why, you lying
unconstant succubus.

952
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:55,539
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>

953
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:58,542
You can't swear at my fiancee!

954
01:03:58,709 --> 01:03:59,543
Oh, yeah?

955
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:02,045
Well, you can't marry my wife!

956
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,846
Unh! Unh!

957
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:26,236
Who is that man?

958
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:30,991
He's not my husband.

959
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:33,493
Just a drifter, I guess.

960
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:35,453
Just some no-account drifter.

961
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:37,581
Aah! Unh!

962
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:41,543
And stay out of Woolworth's!

963
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,801
I'll bet she does imitations, too.

964
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:54,389
<i>Deceitful, two-faced she-wolf.</i>

965
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:56,600
Never trust a female, Delmar.

966
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:58,101
Remember that one
simple precept...

967
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:00,687
and your time with me will
not have been ill-spent.

968
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:01,980
Okay. Everett.

969
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:03,940
"Hit by a train."

970
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:06,693
Truth means nothing
to a woman, Delmar.

971
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:08,028
Triumph of the subjective.

972
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:10,113
You ever been with a woman?

973
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,908
Well, I've...

974
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:15,493
I-I got to get the
family farm back...

975
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:17,287
before I can start
thinking about that.

976
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,456
That's right. If then.

977
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,875
Believe me. Delmar, a woman
is the most fiendish...

978
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:23,793
instrument of torture
ever devised...

979
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:26,630
to bedevil the days of man.

980
01:05:26,797 --> 01:05:29,716
<i>Everett, I never figured
you for a paterfamilias.</i>

981
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:34,638
Ohh, yes. I have spread my seed.

982
01:05:34,805 --> 01:05:36,139
And look what it's...

983
01:05:37,975 --> 01:05:41,519
<i>Goddamn it. What the
hell's going on?</i>

984
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:44,249
<i>Okay, boys. Enjoy
your picture show.</i>

985
01:06:56,637 --> 01:07:02,726
<i>Do... not... seek the treasure.</i>

986
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:06,813
Do not...

987
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:08,732
seek the treasure.

988
01:07:10,651 --> 01:07:12,694
<i>It's a bushwhack.</i>

989
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:15,822
They're fixin' an ambush.

990
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:19,659
Do not seek the treasure.

991
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:25,206
We...

992
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:29,252
We thought you was...

993
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,879
a toad.

994
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:38,011
We... thought...

995
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:42,974
you... was... a toad.

996
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:49,147
Do not seek the treasure.

997
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:51,733
<i>Quiet there! Watch the picture!</i>

998
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:58,990
<i>I signed that bill.</i>

999
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:02,285
<i>I signed a dozen
agriculture bills.</i>

1000
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:05,288
Everyone knows I'm a
friend of the farmer.

1001
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:08,249
What do I gotta do, start
tending livestock?

1002
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:10,043
We can't do that, Daddy.

1003
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:12,087
We might offend our constituency.

1004
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:13,713
We ain't got a constituency!

1005
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:15,799
Stokes got a constituency!

1006
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:20,136
Well, it's a well-run campaign.

1007
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:21,805
Midget and broom and whatnot.

1008
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:23,264
Devil his due.

1009
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:24,974
Hell of an organization.

1010
01:08:25,142 --> 01:08:27,477
Say, I got an idea.

1011
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:28,812
<i>What's that, junior?</i>

1012
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:30,688
We can hire us a little fella...

1013
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:32,315
even smaller than Stokes's.

1014
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:34,734
You slump-shouldered sack of nuts!

1015
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:37,862
Why, we'd look like a bunch
of Johnny-come-latelys...

1016
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:40,115
breakin' out our own midget.

1017
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:41,950
Don't matter how stumpy!

1018
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,701
And that's the goddamn
problem right there.

1019
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:46,955
People think Stokes
has got fresh ideas.

1020
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:49,249
He's au courant and
we're the past!

1021
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:51,126
It's a problem of...

1022
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:52,669
- Perception.
- That's right.

1023
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:54,462
Reason why he's pulling
our pants down.

1024
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:55,839
Gonna paddle a little behind.

1025
01:08:56,006 --> 01:08:58,258
Ain't gonna paddle it. Gonna kick it.
Real hard.

1026
01:08:58,425 --> 01:09:00,051
<i>No, I believe he's
gonna paddle it.</i>

1027
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:02,137
<i>I don't believe that's
a proper description.</i>

1028
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:04,931
<i>Well, that's how I'd
characterize it.</i>

1029
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:07,600
<i>I believe it's more of
a kickin' situation.</i>

1030
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:28,454
God-God forgive me.

1031
01:09:28,622 --> 01:09:33,001
I could not gaze
upon that far shore.

1032
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,252
Pete.

1033
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,213
Hold still!

1034
01:09:37,381 --> 01:09:41,050
Can't... stand much longer.

1035
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:44,846
It was-it was a
mo-moment of weakness.

1036
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,806
Quit yer babblin', Pete.
We gotta skedaddle.

1037
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:48,766
<i>That's all I got.</i>

1038
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:51,686
They lured me out for a bathe...

1039
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:54,731
and then they dunked me,
trussed me up like a hog...

1040
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:56,608
and turned me in for the bounty.

1041
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:57,984
I should have guessed it.

1042
01:09:58,152 --> 01:09:59,235
Typical womanly behavior.

1043
01:09:59,403 --> 01:10:00,737
We're just lucky we left...

1044
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:01,905
before they came back for us.

1045
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:03,948
We didn't abandon you, Pete.

1046
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:06,284
We just thought you was a toad.

1047
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,870
No, they never did
turn me into a toad.

1048
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:11,915
Well, that was our mistake then.

1049
01:10:12,082 --> 01:10:14,459
And we was beat up by
a bible salesman...

1050
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:17,086
and banished from Woolworths.

1051
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:18,588
I don't know, Everett.

1052
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:20,381
Was it the one branch
or all of them?

1053
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:23,384
Well, I ain't had it
easy, either, boys.

1054
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:29,182
Frankly, uh, well, I...

1055
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,768
I spilt my guts
about the treasure.

1056
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:33,645
Huh?

1057
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:39,108
I'm awful sorry I
betrayed you, fellas.

1058
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:41,319
Must be my Hogwallop blood.

1059
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:45,740
That's all right. Pete.

1060
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:48,993
Awful white of you to take
it like that, Everett.

1061
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:51,788
I feel wretched.

1062
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:55,625
Spoiling your play for a
million dollar point two.

1063
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:58,795
<i>It's been eatin' at my guts.</i>

1064
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:01,297
Oh, that's all right.

1065
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:07,804
You boys are true friends! Ohh!

1066
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:10,765
You're my boon companions.

1067
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:12,767
Pete, I don't want you...

1068
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,894
to beat yourself
up about this, eh?

1069
01:11:15,062 --> 01:11:16,396
I can't help it...

1070
01:11:16,563 --> 01:11:21,067
but that's a-a wonderful
thing to say.

1071
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,239
Yeah.

1072
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:29,492
Pete, uh...

1073
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:33,496
the fact of the matter is...

1074
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,543
damn it.

1075
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:39,836
There ain't no treasure.

1076
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,508
Fact of the matter
is there never was.

1077
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:47,510
But...

1078
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:52,015
So where's all the money
from the armored car job?

1079
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:56,769
Never knocked over no armored car.

1080
01:11:56,937 --> 01:12:00,106
Sent up for practicing
law without a license.

1081
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:01,107
But...

1082
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:03,026
Damn it, I had to bust out.

1083
01:12:03,193 --> 01:12:05,528
My wife wrote me she
was getting married...

1084
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:07,488
I gotta stop it.

1085
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:10,783
I had 2 weeks left on my sentence.

1086
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:11,826
I couldn't wait 2 weeks.

1087
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:13,077
She's getting married tomorrow.

1088
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:16,539
My added time for the escape...

1089
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:21,461
I don't get out now till 19... 87.

1090
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:23,463
I am sorry about that.

1091
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:26,174
I'll be...

1092
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:29,635
84 years old.

1093
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:33,097
I guess they'll tack on
50 years for me, too.

1094
01:12:33,265 --> 01:12:36,225
Boys, we was chained together.

1095
01:12:36,393 --> 01:12:37,727
I had to tell you something.

1096
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:40,563
Busting out alone
was not an option.

1097
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:42,273
I'm sorry.

1098
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:46,986
84 years old.

1099
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:50,281
Well, I'll only be 82.

1100
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:52,950
You! You ruined my life!

1101
01:12:53,118 --> 01:12:53,951
Unh!

1102
01:12:54,119 --> 01:12:56,454
You ruined my life!

1103
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:58,748
I do apologize about that, Pete.

1104
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:01,167
84 years old!

1105
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:03,294
I'll be going...

1106
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:05,129
Delmar!

1107
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:11,427
Now, boys. Boys.

1108
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:51,486
<i>That's Tommy. They got Tommy.</i>

1109
01:14:55,115 --> 01:14:56,282
Noose.

1110
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:02,663
Sweet Jesus, we got to save him.

1111
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:19,013
The color guard.

1112
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,041
Brothers!

1113
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:51,087
<i>Oh, brothers!</i>

1114
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:54,423
<i>We have all gathered here...</i>

1115
01:15:54,591 --> 01:15:59,262
<i>to preserve our hallowed
culture and heritage...</i>

1116
01:15:59,429 --> 01:16:01,514
<i>from intrusion...</i>

1117
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:03,516
<i>inclusion...</i>

1118
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:05,434
<i>and dilution...</i>

1119
01:16:05,602 --> 01:16:08,437
of color, of creed...

1120
01:16:08,605 --> 01:16:10,773
and of our old-time religion.

1121
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:15,444
<i>We aim to pull evil
up by the root...</i>

1122
01:16:15,612 --> 01:16:17,738
<i>before it chokes out...</i>

1123
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:21,784
the flower of our
culture and heritage.

1124
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:22,785
And our women.

1125
01:16:22,953 --> 01:16:25,788
Let's not forget those
ladies, y'all...

1126
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:28,916
looking to us for protection...

1127
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:30,376
from darkies...

1128
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:31,961
from jews...

1129
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:33,921
from papists...

1130
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:36,090
and from all those
smart-ass folks...

1131
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:39,969
say we come descended
from monkeys.

1132
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:42,096
That's not my culture
and heritage.

1133
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:43,306
<i>Yes!</i>

1134
01:16:43,473 --> 01:16:44,974
Is that your culture and heritage?

1135
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:47,351
No!

1136
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:50,187
And so...

1137
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:52,315
we gonna hang us a Negro.

1138
01:16:52,482 --> 01:16:55,443
<i>Hooray, hooray!</i>

1139
01:17:06,204 --> 01:17:08,080
I ain't never harmed you...

1140
01:17:08,248 --> 01:17:09,665
Neither of you gentlemen.

1141
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:13,794
Uh...

1142
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:31,604
Mm-hmm.

1143
01:17:33,273 --> 01:17:34,982
I ain't never harmed nobody.

1144
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:39,904
<i>Hey, hey, Tommy.</i>

1145
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:41,197
Huh?

1146
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:43,282
<i>Tommy, we come to rescue you.</i>

1147
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:45,618
That's mighty kind of you boys...

1148
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:49,038
but I don't think nothing's
going to save me now.

1149
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:53,209
<i>The devil's come to
collect his due.</i>

1150
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:55,378
Don't be crazy, Tommy.

1151
01:17:55,545 --> 01:17:57,380
You don't want to get hanged.

1152
01:17:57,547 --> 01:17:59,715
Well, nah, I don't reckon I do...

1153
01:17:59,883 --> 01:18:02,468
but that's the way it
seems to be working out.

1154
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:07,139
Listen, Tommy, I got a plan.

1155
01:18:10,268 --> 01:18:11,644
No!

1156
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:18,818
The color guard is colored.

1157
01:18:20,904 --> 01:18:22,154
Who made them the color guard?

1158
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:28,202
Run, boys!

1159
01:18:32,457 --> 01:18:34,667
Whoa!

1160
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:35,960
No, no, son!

1161
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,215
<i>Can't let that flag
touch the ground!</i>

1162
01:18:47,764 --> 01:18:49,014
Ooh.

1163
01:18:50,308 --> 01:18:51,350
Heh heh.

1164
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:08,701
Leave me alone. Get
your hands off me.

1165
01:19:08,869 --> 01:19:12,079
I can do this myself.
Get away from me.

1166
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:14,749
I'm saying we should
hire this man away.

1167
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:15,791
That's a good idea, Pappy.

1168
01:19:15,959 --> 01:19:16,792
Hell of an idea.

1169
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:17,793
Can't beat 'em. Join 'em.

1170
01:19:17,961 --> 01:19:19,712
Have him join us.
Run our campaign...

1171
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:20,838
instead of that egghead's.

1172
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:23,048
Enticements of power,
wealth, et cetera.

1173
01:19:23,216 --> 01:19:25,301
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.

1174
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:26,385
Oh, gracious, no...

1175
01:19:26,553 --> 01:19:27,803
Not with his blandishments.

1176
01:19:27,971 --> 01:19:28,971
And powers of persuasion.

1177
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:30,306
What's his name again?

1178
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:31,307
The campaign manager?

1179
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:32,308
Yes.

1180
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:33,309
Waldrip.

1181
01:19:33,477 --> 01:19:34,310
Vernon Waldrip.

1182
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:35,311
Vernon T. Waldrip.

1183
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:36,395
Hmm.

1184
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:45,362
It's an invitation-only affair.

1185
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:46,489
We'll have to sneak in...

1186
01:19:46,656 --> 01:19:47,531
through the service entrance.

1187
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:48,532
Hold on.

1188
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:50,201
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

1189
01:19:50,368 --> 01:19:52,703
Who elected you leader
of this outfit?

1190
01:19:52,871 --> 01:19:55,080
Since we've been
following your lead...

1191
01:19:55,248 --> 01:19:57,082
we got nothing but trouble.

1192
01:19:57,250 --> 01:20:00,044
I've gotten this close
to being strung up...

1193
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:03,380
and consumed in a fire
and whipped no end...

1194
01:20:03,548 --> 01:20:05,382
and sunstroked and soggied.

1195
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:07,051
And turned into a frog.

1196
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:08,761
He wasn't turned into a frog.

1197
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:11,889
Almost loved up, though.

1198
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:17,102
So, you're against me now, too?

1199
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:18,687
Is that how it is, boys?

1200
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:23,067
The whole world...

1201
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:25,194
and God almighty...

1202
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:26,612
Now you?

1203
01:20:30,534 --> 01:20:32,576
I guess I deserve it.

1204
01:20:34,579 --> 01:20:36,372
Boys...

1205
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:40,209
I know that I made some
tactical mistakes...

1206
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:41,794
but if you just stick with me...

1207
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:43,587
I got a plan. Believe me. Boys...

1208
01:20:43,755 --> 01:20:45,548
we can fix this thing...

1209
01:20:45,715 --> 01:20:46,590
and I can get my wife back...

1210
01:20:46,758 --> 01:20:47,675
and we can get out of here.

1211
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:55,432
Goddamn disgrace!

1212
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,060
Made a travesty of
the entire evening.

1213
01:20:58,228 --> 01:20:59,311
Ohh.

1214
01:20:59,479 --> 01:21:02,231
What I wouldn't give to get
ahold of those agitators.

1215
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:04,191
I mean, whoever heard
of such behavior...

1216
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:06,068
even amongst the colored?

1217
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:07,194
Or mulattos, maybe.

1218
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:09,613
I suspect some miscegenation
in their heritage.

1219
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:11,073
How else you going to explain it?

1220
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:13,576
Using a confederate
flag as a missile...

1221
01:21:13,743 --> 01:21:16,245
Crazy! No one's ever
going to believe...

1222
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:17,413
we're a real band.

1223
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:18,539
No. It's going to work.

1224
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:20,541
I just got to get close
enough to talk to her.

1225
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:21,834
Taking off with us has
got more future...

1226
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:23,627
than marrying some
guy named Waldrip.

1227
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:25,462
I'm goddamn bona fide.

1228
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:26,922
I got the answers.

1229
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:28,382
<i>Everett, my beard itches.</i>

1230
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:36,056
Hey. Hey.

1231
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:44,189
"In the Jailhouse Now," fellers...

1232
01:21:44,357 --> 01:21:46,233
neighborhood of "B."

1233
01:21:52,032 --> 01:21:54,074
Psst!

1234
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:55,075
Penny.

1235
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:57,912
<i>Ahem.</i>

1236
01:21:58,079 --> 01:21:59,580
It's me.

1237
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:02,041
No.

1238
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:05,169
<i>Honey, honey.</i>

1239
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:22,144
We're leaving the state.

1240
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:23,979
Pursuing opportunities
in another venue.

1241
01:22:24,147 --> 01:22:26,315
<i>I got big plans.</i>

1242
01:22:26,483 --> 01:22:27,775
Not minstrels... this
here's just a dodge.

1243
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:29,276
I'm going to be a dentist.

1244
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:32,863
<i>I know this guy who'll
print me up a license.</i>

1245
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:16,365
Why, that is an
improper suggestion.

1246
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:18,575
I-I-l can't switch sides...

1247
01:23:18,743 --> 01:23:21,704
in the middle of a campaign...

1248
01:23:21,871 --> 01:23:25,374
Especially to work for a
man who lacks moral fiber.

1249
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:26,834
Moral fiber?

1250
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:28,919
Why, you little
pasty-face sumbitch.

1251
01:23:29,087 --> 01:23:30,754
I invented moral fiber.

1252
01:23:30,922 --> 01:23:32,089
Pappy O'Daniel was displaying...

1253
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:33,382
<i>rectitude and high-mindedness...</i>

1254
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:35,300
<i>when that egghead you work for...</i>

1255
01:23:35,468 --> 01:23:36,885
was still messing his drawers.

1256
01:23:37,053 --> 01:23:38,345
<i>Psst! Honey.</i>

1257
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:39,888
Go away.

1258
01:23:40,056 --> 01:23:42,558
I want to be what you
want me to be, honey.

1259
01:23:42,726 --> 01:23:44,226
I want you and the
gals to come with me.

1260
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:45,602
What. Dear?

1261
01:23:50,775 --> 01:23:54,278
What are you doing here, Pappy?

1262
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:55,279
Well, I guess someone let on...

1263
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:56,572
we was giving out liquor.

1264
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:57,698
Yeah, well. You'll be laughing...

1265
01:23:57,866 --> 01:23:59,742
out the other side of
your face come November.

1266
01:23:59,909 --> 01:24:01,702
<i>Pappy O'Daniel will
be laughing then.</i>

1267
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:03,579
Not out the other side of his face.
Though.

1268
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:05,622
Oh, no, no, no. Just
the regular side.

1269
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:20,721
They're my daughters, too, Penny.

1270
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:24,308
Ain't you ever heard
of amor fidelis?

1271
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:55,839
Hot damn! It's the
Soggy Bottom Boys!

1272
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:22,074
Oh!

1273
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:25,786
<i>Whoo!</i>

1274
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:36,505
Holy moley!

1275
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:37,840
These boys are a hit.

1276
01:25:38,007 --> 01:25:40,509
But, Pappy, they's integrated.

1277
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:43,053
Wait a minute.

1278
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:45,722
Well, I guess folks don't
mind they's integrated.

1279
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:48,183
You's miscegenated.

1280
01:25:48,351 --> 01:25:50,310
<i>All you boys is miscegenated!</i>

1281
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:51,520
<i>Give me the microphone!</i>

1282
01:25:51,688 --> 01:25:54,940
Give me the microphone!
Give me the microphone!

1283
01:25:55,108 --> 01:25:57,192
These boys is not white.

1284
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:58,735
These boys is not white.

1285
01:25:58,903 --> 01:26:00,529
Hell, they ain't even old-timey.

1286
01:26:00,697 --> 01:26:03,282
Look, I happen to know,
ladies and gentlemen...

1287
01:26:03,449 --> 01:26:05,200
that this band of
miscreants here...

1288
01:26:05,368 --> 01:26:06,326
this very evening...

1289
01:26:06,494 --> 01:26:08,245
interfered with a lynch mob...

1290
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:11,999
in the performance of its duties.

1291
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,625
Oh, yeah, it's true.

1292
01:26:13,793 --> 01:26:16,378
See, I belong to a
certain secret society.

1293
01:26:16,546 --> 01:26:19,673
I don't believe I got to
mention its name, you know?

1294
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:22,342
<i>Let 'em play! Go on!</i>

1295
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:23,969
Hmm.

1296
01:26:24,137 --> 01:26:26,096
And these boys here...

1297
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:28,307
they trampled all over our
venerated observances...

1298
01:26:28,474 --> 01:26:29,474
and rituals.

1299
01:26:29,642 --> 01:26:33,145
Now, this here music
is over, all right?

1300
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:34,938
And I have-No! Hey!

1301
01:26:35,106 --> 01:26:37,733
<i>Hey, I ain't... listen to me.</i>

1302
01:26:37,901 --> 01:26:39,985
Folks, listen to me. I...

1303
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:43,363
These boys desecrated
a fiery cross.

1304
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:46,909
<i>We was all havin' a good time!</i>

1305
01:26:47,076 --> 01:26:48,535
And they's convicts, folks...

1306
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:51,163
Fugitives escaped off the farm.

1307
01:26:51,331 --> 01:26:53,707
Now, folks, these boys
got to be remanded...

1308
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:55,250
to the authorities.

1309
01:26:55,418 --> 01:26:56,460
Criminals!

1310
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:59,379
And I have it from the
highest authority...

1311
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:02,674
that that Negro sold
his soul to the devil!

1312
01:27:02,842 --> 01:27:04,468
Ohh!

1313
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:05,761
<i>Wait, wait, wait a
minute, now, folks.</i>

1314
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:07,804
<i>No! It's true!</i>

1315
01:27:07,972 --> 01:27:09,932
It's true.

1316
01:27:10,099 --> 01:27:11,350
Wait a minute. Wait
a minute, folks.

1317
01:27:11,517 --> 01:27:14,728
Is you is, or is you
ain't my constituency?

1318
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:15,938
<i>No!</i>

1319
01:27:16,105 --> 01:27:17,439
<i>Is you is, or is you ain't...</i>

1320
01:27:17,607 --> 01:27:18,732
<i>my constituency?</i>

1321
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:21,068
<i>No!</i>

1322
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:23,904
Is you is...

1323
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:26,990
Is you is, or is you ain't...

1324
01:27:27,158 --> 01:27:28,533
<i>My constituency?</i>

1325
01:27:28,701 --> 01:27:31,203
Oh, come on, folks.

1326
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:32,955
No. It's Homer now.

1327
01:27:33,122 --> 01:27:35,290
Come on. I'm a friend
of the little man.

1328
01:27:35,458 --> 01:27:37,084
- Ha ha ha ha!
- Waah!

1329
01:27:46,594 --> 01:27:48,178
<i>This is not fair!</i>

1330
01:27:48,346 --> 01:27:49,930
Hey! Come on!

1331
01:27:53,059 --> 01:27:53,934
Come on, now, folks...

1332
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:55,727
we got a little
misunderstanding here.

1333
01:27:55,895 --> 01:27:57,187
Goddamn!

1334
01:28:35,893 --> 01:28:38,228
Goddamn! Opportunity knocks.

1335
01:28:39,814 --> 01:28:42,024
Get out of my way!

1336
01:29:10,219 --> 01:29:11,386
That's fine.

1337
01:29:11,554 --> 01:29:12,554
That's fine!

1338
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:19,436
Ladies and gentlemens...

1339
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:22,022
here and listening at home...

1340
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:25,400
the great state of Mississippi...

1341
01:29:25,568 --> 01:29:27,569
Pappy O'Daniel, governor...

1342
01:29:27,737 --> 01:29:29,988
Wants to thank the
Soggy Bottom Boys...

1343
01:29:30,156 --> 01:29:32,032
for that wonderful performance.

1344
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:38,205
And it looks like...

1345
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:40,415
the only man in
this great state...

1346
01:29:40,583 --> 01:29:42,125
who ain't a music lover...

1347
01:29:42,293 --> 01:29:44,753
is my esteemed opponent
in the upcoming...

1348
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:47,005
Homer Stokes.

1349
01:29:47,173 --> 01:29:48,799
Yeah, well. There ain't
no accounting for taste.

1350
01:29:50,301 --> 01:29:51,802
He sounded to me like
he was harboring...

1351
01:29:51,969 --> 01:29:53,470
some kind of hateful grudge...

1352
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:55,347
against the Soggy Bottom Boys...

1353
01:29:55,515 --> 01:29:58,100
on account of their
rough and rowdy past.

1354
01:29:59,268 --> 01:30:00,102
<i>Looks like-</i>

1355
01:30:00,269 --> 01:30:01,603
Looks like...

1356
01:30:01,771 --> 01:30:03,355
Homer Stokes is the
kind of fellow...

1357
01:30:03,523 --> 01:30:05,273
wants to cast the first stone.

1358
01:30:06,692 --> 01:30:08,777
Well, I'm with you, folks.

1359
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:11,113
I'm a forgive and
forget Christian...

1360
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:14,783
and I say if their
rambunctiousness...

1361
01:30:14,951 --> 01:30:18,036
and misdemeanoring
is behind them...

1362
01:30:18,204 --> 01:30:19,371
It is, ain't it, boys?

1363
01:30:19,539 --> 01:30:21,289
Yes, sir, it is.

1364
01:30:21,457 --> 01:30:23,417
Well, then. I say...

1365
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:26,002
by the power vested in me...

1366
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:29,089
these boys is hereby pardoned.

1367
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:34,553
And furthermore...

1368
01:30:35,888 --> 01:30:38,807
in the second Pappy
O'Daniel administration...

1369
01:30:38,975 --> 01:30:42,310
these boys is going to
be in my brain trust.

1370
01:30:47,358 --> 01:30:48,650
What's that mean, Everett?

1371
01:30:48,818 --> 01:30:51,403
Well, Delmar, it means
that you and me...

1372
01:30:51,571 --> 01:30:52,946
and Pete and Tommy
are going to be...

1373
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:55,449
the power behind the
throne, so to speak.

1374
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:58,243
Oh, okay.

1375
01:30:58,411 --> 01:31:00,162
<i>So, without further ado...</i>

1376
01:31:00,329 --> 01:31:03,206
and by way of endorsing
my candidacy...

1377
01:31:03,374 --> 01:31:05,000
the Soggy Bottom Boys...

1378
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:06,835
is going to lead us
all in a chorus...

1379
01:31:07,003 --> 01:31:09,379
of "You Are My Sunshine."

1380
01:31:10,673 --> 01:31:11,840
Ain't you, boys?

1381
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:14,718
Governor. It's one
of our favorites.

1382
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:16,678
Son...

1383
01:31:16,846 --> 01:31:19,473
you're going to go far.

1384
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:46,249
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip...

1385
01:31:46,417 --> 01:31:48,376
is gonna be going on relief.

1386
01:31:48,544 --> 01:31:51,421
Maybe I can throw a little
patronage his way...

1387
01:31:51,589 --> 01:31:52,964
Get him a job digging ditches...

1388
01:31:53,132 --> 01:31:54,633
or rounding up stray dogs.

1389
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:57,219
So, is the marriage off,
then, Miss Wharvey?

1390
01:31:57,386 --> 01:31:58,512
It's McGill.

1391
01:31:58,679 --> 01:32:01,223
No. The marriage will
take place as planned.

1392
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:03,308
With a little change of cast.

1393
01:32:03,476 --> 01:32:05,644
Me and the little lady are
going to pick up the pieces...

1394
01:32:05,811 --> 01:32:08,980
and retie the knot,
mixaphorically speaking.

1395
01:32:09,148 --> 01:32:11,566
You boys are invited, of course.

1396
01:32:11,734 --> 01:32:13,527
Hell, you're the best men.

1397
01:32:13,694 --> 01:32:14,986
I already got the rings.

1398
01:32:16,155 --> 01:32:17,239
Where's your ring, honey?

1399
01:32:17,406 --> 01:32:19,908
I ain't worn it since our
divorce came through.

1400
01:32:20,076 --> 01:32:22,077
It must still be in the
roll-top in the old cabin.

1401
01:32:22,245 --> 01:32:23,620
Never thought I'd need it.

1402
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:25,830
Vernon bought one
encrusted with jewels.

1403
01:32:25,998 --> 01:32:28,250
Now's the time to buy
it off him cheap.

1404
01:32:30,253 --> 01:32:31,419
We ain't getting
married with his ring.

1405
01:32:31,587 --> 01:32:33,255
You said you'd changed.

1406
01:32:33,422 --> 01:32:34,756
Honey, it's just an
old pewter thing.

1407
01:32:34,924 --> 01:32:35,924
Ain't going to be no wedding.

1408
01:32:36,092 --> 01:32:37,717
It's just a symbol, honey.

1409
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:38,718
No wedding.

1410
01:32:38,886 --> 01:32:40,428
We'll go fetch it
with you, Everett.

1411
01:32:40,596 --> 01:32:42,222
It's just a... Shut up, Delmar.

1412
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:43,431
It's just a symbol.

1413
01:32:43,599 --> 01:32:47,185
I've spoken my piece
and counted to 3.

1414
01:32:47,353 --> 01:32:48,520
She counted to 3.

1415
01:32:48,688 --> 01:32:51,273
Goddamn it.

1416
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:52,983
She counted to 3.

1417
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:54,401
Son of a bitch!

1418
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:57,112
You have any idea how
far that cabin is?

1419
01:33:13,921 --> 01:33:15,255
George?

1420
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:17,173
Hello, boys!

1421
01:33:17,341 --> 01:33:18,717
Well, these little men...

1422
01:33:18,884 --> 01:33:21,595
finally caught up with the
criminal of the century.

1423
01:33:21,762 --> 01:33:23,972
Looks like the chair
for George Nelson.

1424
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:26,891
<i>Yup, gonna electrify me.</i>

1425
01:33:27,059 --> 01:33:29,561
<i>I'm going to go off
like a Roman candle.</i>

1426
01:33:29,729 --> 01:33:30,770
Ha ha ha!

1427
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:32,188
20,000 volts...

1428
01:33:32,356 --> 01:33:34,441
chasing a rabbit
through yours truly.

1429
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:35,817
<i>Gol damn...</i>

1430
01:33:35,985 --> 01:33:38,445
<i>gonna suck all the power
right out of the state.</i>

1431
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:41,114
Gonna shoot sparks out
the top of my head...

1432
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:43,283
and lightning from my fingertips!

1433
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:45,118
<i>I'm George Nelson...</i>

1434
01:33:45,286 --> 01:33:47,912
<i>and I'm feeling 10 feet tall!</i>

1435
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:51,708
Looks like George is
right back on top again.

1436
01:33:53,085 --> 01:33:54,461
Cow killer!

1437
01:34:07,516 --> 01:34:09,017
Well, at least you
boys get to see...

1438
01:34:09,185 --> 01:34:11,519
the ancestral manse...

1439
01:34:11,687 --> 01:34:14,064
The home where I spent
so many a happy day...

1440
01:34:14,231 --> 01:34:16,149
in the bosom of my family...

1441
01:34:16,317 --> 01:34:17,859
refugin', if you will...

1442
01:34:18,027 --> 01:34:19,653
With a mighty oak
tree out front...

1443
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:22,739
<i>and a happy little
tire swing on it.</i>

1444
01:34:27,703 --> 01:34:31,164
Where's the happy
little tire swing?

1445
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:36,419
<i>End of the road, boys.</i>

1446
01:34:36,587 --> 01:34:37,545
No. Wait a minute.

1447
01:34:37,713 --> 01:34:38,755
Let's go. Boys.

1448
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:40,298
<i>It's had its twists and turns.</i>

1449
01:34:40,466 --> 01:34:43,510
Now it deposits you here.

1450
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:44,928
Wait a minute.

1451
01:34:45,096 --> 01:34:46,554
<i>You have eluded fate...</i>

1452
01:34:46,722 --> 01:34:48,473
<i>and you have eluded me...</i>

1453
01:34:48,641 --> 01:34:50,725
for the last time.

1454
01:34:50,893 --> 01:34:52,394
Tie their hands, boys.

1455
01:34:52,561 --> 01:34:53,895
You can't do this, now.

1456
01:34:54,063 --> 01:34:56,940
Didn't know you'd be
bringing a friend.

1457
01:34:57,108 --> 01:34:59,109
He'll just have to
wait his turn...

1458
01:34:59,276 --> 01:35:01,236
<i>share one of your graves.</i>

1459
01:35:01,404 --> 01:35:02,529
You can't do this.

1460
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:04,906
We just got pardoned by
the governor hisself.

1461
01:35:05,074 --> 01:35:06,700
It went out on the radio.

1462
01:35:08,244 --> 01:35:09,160
Is that right?

1463
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:14,499
Well, we ain't got a radio.

1464
01:35:17,086 --> 01:35:18,837
God have mercy.

1465
01:35:42,528 --> 01:35:44,154
It ain't fittin'.

1466
01:35:44,321 --> 01:35:45,655
It ain't the law.

1467
01:35:45,823 --> 01:35:47,407
The law?

1468
01:35:49,326 --> 01:35:52,537
The law is a human institution.

1469
01:35:59,587 --> 01:36:02,589
Perhaps you should start
making your prayers.

1470
01:36:16,353 --> 01:36:18,062
Oh, my God.

1471
01:36:18,230 --> 01:36:19,105
Everett?

1472
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:24,527
Tommy, I'm sorry we
got you into this.

1473
01:36:24,695 --> 01:36:26,905
Good Lord...

1474
01:36:27,072 --> 01:36:28,531
what do we do?

1475
01:36:38,501 --> 01:36:41,461
Oh, Lord...

1476
01:36:41,629 --> 01:36:42,754
please look down and recognize...

1477
01:36:42,922 --> 01:36:44,964
us poor sinners.

1478
01:36:48,093 --> 01:36:50,220
Please, Lord.

1479
01:36:50,387 --> 01:36:54,349
I just want to see
my daughters again.

1480
01:36:54,517 --> 01:36:58,686
I've been separated from
my family for so long.

1481
01:36:58,854 --> 01:37:00,104
I know I've been
guilty of pride...

1482
01:37:00,272 --> 01:37:02,065
and sharp dealing.

1483
01:37:02,233 --> 01:37:04,526
I'm sorry that I
turned my back on you.

1484
01:37:04,693 --> 01:37:07,654
<i>Forgive me.</i>

1485
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:10,740
<i>We're helpless, Lord.</i>

1486
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:12,534
<i>For the sake of my family.</i>

1487
01:37:12,701 --> 01:37:14,536
For Tommy's sake.

1488
01:37:14,703 --> 01:37:16,746
For Delmar's and Pete's.

1489
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,043
Let me see my daughters
again, Lord.

1490
01:37:24,046 --> 01:37:26,798
<i>Help us, please.</i>

1491
01:39:39,807 --> 01:39:41,683
Ahh. Ahh.

1492
01:39:41,850 --> 01:39:43,643
A miracle.

1493
01:39:43,811 --> 01:39:45,019
It was a miracle!

1494
01:39:45,187 --> 01:39:46,646
Delmar, don't be ignorant.

1495
01:39:46,814 --> 01:39:48,272
I told you they was
flooding this valley.

1496
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:49,941
No! That ain't it!

1497
01:39:50,109 --> 01:39:52,026
We prayed to God and he pitied us!

1498
01:39:52,194 --> 01:39:53,695
Well, it never fails.

1499
01:39:53,862 --> 01:39:55,697
Once again, you two
hayseeds are showin'

1500
01:39:55,864 --> 01:39:57,573
how much you want for intellect.

1501
01:39:57,741 --> 01:39:59,075
There's a perfectly
scientific explanation...

1502
01:39:59,243 --> 01:40:00,201
for what just happened.

1503
01:40:00,369 --> 01:40:02,203
That ain't the tune
you was singin'...

1504
01:40:02,371 --> 01:40:04,038
back there at the gallows!

1505
01:40:04,206 --> 01:40:05,957
Well, any human being
will cast about...

1506
01:40:06,125 --> 01:40:07,291
in a moment of stress.

1507
01:40:07,459 --> 01:40:10,253
No, the fact is, they're
flooding this valley...

1508
01:40:10,421 --> 01:40:12,505
so they can hydroelectric
up the whole durn state.

1509
01:40:12,673 --> 01:40:16,134
Yes, sir, the South
is gonna change.

1510
01:40:16,301 --> 01:40:17,635
Everything's gonna be
put on electricity...

1511
01:40:17,803 --> 01:40:19,679
and run on a paying basis.

1512
01:40:19,847 --> 01:40:21,389
Out with the old
spiritual mumbo jumbo...

1513
01:40:21,557 --> 01:40:23,766
the superstitions, and
the backward ways.

1514
01:40:23,934 --> 01:40:25,727
We're gonna see a
brave new world...

1515
01:40:25,894 --> 01:40:27,729
where they run everybody a wire...

1516
01:40:27,896 --> 01:40:29,230
and hook us all up to a grid.

1517
01:40:29,398 --> 01:40:31,774
Yes, sir, a veritable
age of reason.

1518
01:40:31,942 --> 01:40:33,317
Like the one they had in France.

1519
01:40:33,485 --> 01:40:35,486
Not a moment too soon.

1520
01:40:40,117 --> 01:40:43,202
Not a moment too soon.

1521
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:46,080
Hey, there's Tommy.

1522
01:40:46,248 --> 01:40:48,166
<i>Tommy, what you ridin' there?</i>

1523
01:40:49,209 --> 01:40:52,336
Unh! Whoa.

1524
01:40:52,504 --> 01:40:54,422
Roll-top desk.

1525
01:41:03,807 --> 01:41:06,517
"All's well that ends
well." some poet said.

1526
01:41:06,685 --> 01:41:08,186
That's right, honey.

1527
01:41:08,353 --> 01:41:10,313
Don't mind telling you
I'm awful pleased...

1528
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:13,941
my adventuring days
have come to an end.

1529
01:41:14,109 --> 01:41:16,611
Time for this old boy
to enjoy some repose.

1530
01:41:16,779 --> 01:41:18,279
That's good, honey.

1531
01:41:18,447 --> 01:41:20,531
You were right about
that ring, too.

1532
01:41:20,699 --> 01:41:23,993
Any other wedding
band wouldn't do.

1533
01:41:24,161 --> 01:41:25,703
This here was fore-ordained.

1534
01:41:25,871 --> 01:41:27,705
Fate was a-smilin' on me.

1535
01:41:27,873 --> 01:41:29,624
That's not my ring.

1536
01:41:29,792 --> 01:41:31,918
What? Not your ring?

1537
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:33,669
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.

1538
01:41:33,837 --> 01:41:35,171
You said it was in
the roll-top desk.

1539
01:41:35,339 --> 01:41:36,756
I said I thought it was
in the roll-top desk.

1540
01:41:36,924 --> 01:41:37,799
No, you said...

1541
01:41:37,966 --> 01:41:39,383
Or under the mattress.

1542
01:41:39,551 --> 01:41:41,469
Or maybe in my chifforobe.
I don't know.

1543
01:41:41,637 --> 01:41:44,347
Well, I'm sorry, honey.

1544
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:45,973
We need that ring.

1545
01:41:46,141 --> 01:41:48,684
That ring is at the bottom
of a pretty durn big lake.

1546
01:41:48,852 --> 01:41:49,977
Uh-uh.

1547
01:41:50,145 --> 01:41:51,479
A 9,000-hectare lake.

1548
01:41:51,647 --> 01:41:53,981
I don't care if it's 90.000.
That lake was not my doing.

1549
01:41:54,149 --> 01:41:55,233
Of course not, honey...

1550
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:56,651
I counted to 3, honey.

1551
01:41:56,819 --> 01:41:58,152
No, wait, honey.

1552
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:00,780
Finding one little
ring in the middle...

1553
01:42:00,948 --> 01:42:02,907
<i>of all that water is one
hell of a heroic task!</i>
