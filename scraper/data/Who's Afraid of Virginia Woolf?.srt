1
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:47,771
- It's 2 o'clock in the morning.
- Oh, George!

2
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:49,271
Well, it is.

3
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:52,371
What a cluck you are!

4
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:55,071
It's late, you know. It's late.

5
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:18,171
What a dump!

6
00:04:20,571 --> 00:04:23,671
Hey, what's that from? "What a dump!"

7
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:25,871
How would I know?

8
00:04:26,371 --> 00:04:29,071
Oh, come on, what's it from?
You know!

9
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,371
What's it from, for Christ's sake?

10
00:04:34,771 --> 00:04:36,271
What's what from?

11
00:04:37,071 --> 00:04:40,071
I just told you. I just did it.

12
00:04:40,371 --> 00:04:42,371
"What a dump!"

13
00:04:43,371 --> 00:04:45,371
Huh? What's that from?

14
00:04:45,771 --> 00:04:47,571
I haven't the faintest idea.

15
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:49,471
Dumbbell!

16
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:52,271
It's from some Bette Davis picture...

17
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:54,571
...some goddamn Warner Brothers epic.

18
00:04:54,871 --> 00:04:58,871
Martha, I can't remember all the films
that came out of Warner Brothers.

19
00:04:59,271 --> 00:05:02,271
Nobody's asking you to remember
every Warner Brothers epic.

20
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:04,771
Just one single little epic.
That's all.

21
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,971
Bette Davis gets peritonitis at the end.

22
00:05:08,271 --> 00:05:10,971
And she wears a fright wig
throughout the picture.

23
00:05:11,271 --> 00:05:13,471
She's married to Joseph Cotten
or something.

24
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:14,771
Somebody.

25
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:20,471
She wants to go to Chicago because
she loves that actor with the scar.

26
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,271
She gets sick...

27
00:05:22,471 --> 00:05:24,571
...and sits down at her dressing table...

28
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:26,471
What actor? What scar?

29
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:29,571
I can't remember his name!
What's the picture?

30
00:05:29,971 --> 00:05:31,971
I want to know the name of the picture.

31
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:35,771
She gets this peritonitis...

32
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:39,971
...and decides to go to Chicago anyway.

33
00:05:40,671 --> 00:05:42,671
"Chicago"! It's called "Chicago."

34
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:46,471
What is?

35
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:49,871
I mean the picture. It's "Chicago."

36
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:52,671
Oh, good grief!

37
00:05:53,671 --> 00:05:55,271
Don't you know anything?

38
00:05:56,171 --> 00:05:58,771
"Chicago" was a '30s musical...

39
00:05:59,171 --> 00:06:02,671
...starring little Miss Alice Faye.
Don't you know anything?

40
00:06:03,971 --> 00:06:04,971
This picture...

41
00:06:05,771 --> 00:06:09,471
...Bette Davis comes home from
a hard day at the grocery store...

42
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:11,471
She works in a grocery store?

43
00:06:12,871 --> 00:06:15,471
She's a housewife. She buys things.

44
00:06:17,671 --> 00:06:19,171
She comes with the groceries...

45
00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:22,471
...and she walks into
the modest living room...

46
00:06:22,871 --> 00:06:26,671
...of the modest cottage
modest Joseph Cotten set her up in.

47
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:27,871
Are they married?

48
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,871
Yes, they're married.
To each other, cluck!

49
00:06:32,671 --> 00:06:37,371
And she comes in
and she looks around this room...

50
00:06:38,971 --> 00:06:41,171
...and she sets down her groceries.

51
00:06:41,871 --> 00:06:43,071
And she says...

52
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:46,071
..."What a dump!"

53
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:53,871
She's discontent.

54
00:06:57,071 --> 00:06:58,571
What's the name of the picture?

55
00:06:59,371 --> 00:07:00,871
I really don't know.

56
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,571
Well, think!

57
00:07:02,871 --> 00:07:03,871
I'm tired, dear.

58
00:07:04,171 --> 00:07:07,571
I don't know why you're tired.
You didn't do anything today.

59
00:07:07,871 --> 00:07:09,671
- I'm tired.
- You didn't have classes.

60
00:07:09,871 --> 00:07:13,771
If your father didn't always set up
these Saturday night orgies...

61
00:07:14,071 --> 00:07:15,871
Well, it's just too bad about you.

62
00:07:16,271 --> 00:07:17,871
Well, that's how it is anyway.

63
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,571
You didn't do anything. You never do.
You never mix!

64
00:07:22,871 --> 00:07:24,571
You just sit around and talk.

65
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:29,371
What do you want me to do?
Bray at everyone all night like you do?

66
00:07:29,771 --> 00:07:31,371
I don't bray!

67
00:07:31,771 --> 00:07:33,771
All right, you don't bray.

68
00:07:34,771 --> 00:07:36,271
I did not bray.

69
00:07:36,571 --> 00:07:38,071
I said you didn't bray!

70
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:41,271
Fix me a drink.

71
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:43,871
Haven't you had enough?

72
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:46,971
I said fix me a drink!

73
00:07:49,271 --> 00:07:52,971
Well, I don't suppose a nightcap
would kill either of us.

74
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:56,071
A nightcap? Are you kidding?

75
00:07:57,771 --> 00:07:58,871
We've got guests.

76
00:08:01,271 --> 00:08:02,071
Got what?

77
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:07,071
Guests. Guests!

78
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:13,471
Yeah, guests. People.
We've got guests coming over.

79
00:08:14,071 --> 00:08:14,971
When?

80
00:08:15,971 --> 00:08:16,971
Now.

81
00:08:17,971 --> 00:08:20,271
Good Lord, Martha,
do you know what time it is?

82
00:08:22,171 --> 00:08:23,471
Who's coming over?

83
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:25,871
- What's-their-name.
- Who?

84
00:08:27,571 --> 00:08:29,271
Who's what's-their-name?

85
00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:33,271
I don't know their name, George.

86
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:38,271
We met tonight. They're new. He's
in the math department or something.

87
00:08:38,671 --> 00:08:41,171
I don't remember
meeting anybody tonight.

88
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:42,971
Well, you did.

89
00:08:43,171 --> 00:08:45,971
Of all the asinine...
Who are these people?

90
00:08:46,271 --> 00:08:49,171
He's in the Math Department.

91
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:50,271
Who?

92
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:55,371
He's in the Math Department.
He's young and he's blond...

93
00:08:55,971 --> 00:08:57,671
He's good-looking, well-built?

94
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:00,471
Yes, good-looking, well-built.

95
00:09:01,871 --> 00:09:03,871
- It figures.
- What?

96
00:09:04,071 --> 00:09:05,171
Nothing.

97
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:09,171
His wife's a mousy little type
without any hips or anything.

98
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:11,471
Remember them now?

99
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:14,871
I guess so. But why do they
have to come over now?

100
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:18,171
Because Daddy said
we should be nice to them, that's why.

101
00:09:18,971 --> 00:09:21,471
- Daddy said we should be nice to them.
- Why now...?

102
00:09:21,671 --> 00:09:24,371
Because Daddy said
we should be nice to them!

103
00:09:24,671 --> 00:09:28,171
He didn't mean we were supposed
to stay up all night with them.

104
00:09:28,571 --> 00:09:30,571
We could have them over
some Sunday.

105
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:33,171
Well, never mind.
Besides, it is Sunday.

106
00:09:34,371 --> 00:09:36,171
Very early Sunday.

107
00:09:37,071 --> 00:09:39,671
- It's ridiculous!
- Well, it's done.

108
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:09,071
Where are they?
If we've got guests, where are they?

109
00:10:09,371 --> 00:10:10,871
They'll be here soon.

110
00:10:11,271 --> 00:10:13,571
What'd they do, go home
and get some sleep first?

111
00:10:14,371 --> 00:10:16,371
They'll be here.

112
00:10:16,571 --> 00:10:17,971
I wish you'd tell me...

113
00:10:18,271 --> 00:10:21,271
...about things. Stop springing
things on me all the time.

114
00:10:21,771 --> 00:10:24,471
I don't spring things
on you all the time.

115
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:28,371
You really do! You're always
springing things on me.

116
00:10:29,271 --> 00:10:30,571
Always.

117
00:10:31,371 --> 00:10:35,171
Poor Georgie Porgie put-upon-pie.

118
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:45,071
What are you doing? Are you sulking?

119
00:10:46,571 --> 00:10:50,071
Let me see. Are you sulking?

120
00:10:50,471 --> 00:10:52,771
Is that what you're doing?

121
00:10:53,471 --> 00:10:54,771
Never mind.

122
00:10:57,571 --> 00:10:59,071
Just don't bother yourself.

123
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:12,771
Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf,
Virginia Woolf, Virginia Woolf?

124
00:11:19,671 --> 00:11:23,071
What's wrong? Didn't think it's funny?
I thought it was a scream.

125
00:11:23,471 --> 00:11:24,571
It was all right.

126
00:11:24,971 --> 00:11:27,071
You laughed when you heard it
at the party.

127
00:11:27,471 --> 00:11:28,971
I smiled. I didn't laugh.

128
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,571
You laughed your goddamn head off!

129
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:32,771
It was all right.

130
00:11:33,171 --> 00:11:34,771
It was a scream.

131
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:37,971
It was very funny, yes.

132
00:11:38,771 --> 00:11:40,371
You make me puke.

133
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:43,771
You make me puke.

134
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,571
Wasn't a very nice thing to say.

135
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:48,471
That wasn't what?

136
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:50,671
A very nice thing to say.

137
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:52,671
Oh, I like your anger.

138
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:56,471
I think that's what I like
about you most.

139
00:11:56,871 --> 00:11:58,171
Your anger.

140
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:03,671
You are such a simp!

141
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:05,771
You haven't got...

142
00:12:07,971 --> 00:12:09,271
...the what?

143
00:12:10,971 --> 00:12:11,771
Guts?

144
00:12:13,871 --> 00:12:15,171
Phrase-maker.

145
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:39,871
You never put any ice in my drink.
Why is that?

146
00:12:40,871 --> 00:12:43,871
I always put ice in your drinks.
You eat it, that's all.

147
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:48,671
It's this habit you've got of chewing
on your ice cubes like a cocker spaniel.

148
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:52,371
You'll crack your big teeth.

149
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:55,371
Well, they're my big teeth.

150
00:12:55,871 --> 00:12:57,571
Yeah, some of them, some of them.

151
00:12:57,871 --> 00:12:59,871
I've got more teeth than you have.

152
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:01,371
Two more.

153
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,671
And you're going bald.

154
00:13:06,771 --> 00:13:07,571
So are you.

155
00:13:26,271 --> 00:13:27,171
Hello, honey.

156
00:13:30,971 --> 00:13:34,271
Come on and give your mommy
a big sloppy kiss.

157
00:13:35,771 --> 00:13:38,371
I want a big sloppy kiss!

158
00:13:38,771 --> 00:13:40,571
I don't want to kiss you right now.

159
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:44,871
Where are these people you invited?

160
00:13:45,271 --> 00:13:49,871
Where is this good looking, well-built
young man and his slim-hipped wife?

161
00:13:50,971 --> 00:13:53,071
Talking to Daddy. They'll be here.

162
00:13:56,271 --> 00:13:57,771
Why didn't you want to kiss me?

163
00:14:11,171 --> 00:14:12,871
Why didn't you want to kiss me?

164
00:14:13,271 --> 00:14:17,271
If I kissed you I'd get all excited.
I'd get beside myself...

165
00:14:17,671 --> 00:14:20,971
...and then I'd have to take you by
force on the living room rug.

166
00:14:21,271 --> 00:14:25,771
Then our guests would walk in and
what would your father say about that?

167
00:14:26,371 --> 00:14:27,971
Oh, you pig!

168
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:32,571
Fix me another drink, lover.

169
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:35,671
God, you can swill it down, can't you?

170
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:37,271
I'm thirsty!

171
00:14:37,671 --> 00:14:38,671
Oh, Jesus!

172
00:14:38,971 --> 00:14:42,971
I can drink you under any table you
want, so don't worry about me.

173
00:14:43,371 --> 00:14:47,971
You got the prize years ago.
You've won every abomination award.

174
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:51,471
I swear if you existed I'd divorce you.

175
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:54,971
- Stay on your feet for your guests.
- I can't even see you!

176
00:14:55,471 --> 00:14:59,471
If you pass out or throw up...
And try to keep your clothes on too.

177
00:14:59,871 --> 00:15:04,171
There's no more sickening sight than
you drunk and your skirt over your head.

178
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,471
Your heads, I should say.

179
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:09,871
Party! Party!

180
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:12,871
I'm really looking forward to this.

181
00:15:13,071 --> 00:15:15,071
- Go answer the door.
- You answer it.

182
00:15:15,271 --> 00:15:16,471
Get to that door, you!

183
00:15:17,871 --> 00:15:18,871
Come on in!

184
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:20,671
Get over and answer that door.

185
00:15:21,071 --> 00:15:25,171
All right. Whatever love wants.
Just don't start on the bit, that's all.

186
00:15:25,571 --> 00:15:27,071
The bit?

187
00:15:27,871 --> 00:15:30,671
What language is that?
Imitating one of your students?

188
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,971
Don't start in on the bit
about the kid, that's all.

189
00:15:34,371 --> 00:15:36,671
- What do you take me for?
- Much too much.

190
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:38,871
I'll start in on the kid if I want to.

191
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,371
I'd advise against it.

192
00:15:40,771 --> 00:15:43,871
Well, good for you.
Get over there and open that door.

193
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:45,371
You've been advised.

194
00:15:45,771 --> 00:15:46,671
Sure. Get over there.

195
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,871
Yes, love. Whatever love wants.

196
00:15:49,771 --> 00:15:51,371
Some people still have manners...

197
00:15:51,771 --> 00:15:54,371
...and just don't break into
people's houses.

198
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:58,371
Even if they hear a subhuman monster
yowling at them from inside.

199
00:15:58,771 --> 00:15:59,871
Goddamn you!

200
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:10,871
You must be our little guests.

201
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:14,671
Just ignore old sourpuss here.
Come on in, kids!

202
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:18,071
Just hand your coats to old sourpuss
here.

203
00:16:18,571 --> 00:16:19,871
Perhaps we shouldn't have come.

204
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,771
Yes, it is late!

205
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:25,871
Late! Are you kidding?
Just throw your stuff down any place.

206
00:16:26,271 --> 00:16:29,071
Furniture, floor.
Makes no difference around here.

207
00:16:30,071 --> 00:16:31,771
I told you we shouldn't have come.

208
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:34,071
I said come on in. Now come on!

209
00:16:36,971 --> 00:16:38,771
Look, muckmouth, you cut that out!

210
00:16:39,971 --> 00:16:42,071
Martha's a devil with language.

211
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,171
Kids, sit down.

212
00:16:49,971 --> 00:16:52,071
Isn't this lovely?

213
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,171
- Yes, indeed. Very handsome.
- Thank you.

214
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:14,071
Who did the painting?

215
00:17:15,671 --> 00:17:19,071
Some Greek with a mustache
Martha attacked one night in a...

216
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:24,171
It's got a...

217
00:17:24,671 --> 00:17:26,671
- Quiet intensity?
- Well, no...

218
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:29,171
Then a certain
noisy relaxed quality maybe?

219
00:17:30,971 --> 00:17:33,171
How about a quietly
noisy relaxed intensity?

220
00:17:33,371 --> 00:17:35,171
Dear, you're being joshed.

221
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:36,971
I'm aware of that.

222
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:38,271
I am sorry.

223
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:43,171
It's actually a pictorial representation
of the order of Martha's mind.

224
00:17:46,671 --> 00:17:47,771
Fix the kids a drink.

225
00:17:48,071 --> 00:17:49,871
What would you like to drink?

226
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:53,671
What would you like?

227
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:57,871
A little brandy maybe.
Never mix, never worry!

228
00:17:58,171 --> 00:18:00,371
Brandy? Just brandy.
Simple, simple.

229
00:18:00,671 --> 00:18:02,171
What about you...

230
00:18:06,071 --> 00:18:07,571
Bourbon, if you don't mind.

231
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:10,171
Mind? I don't mind.
Don't think I mind.

232
00:18:10,571 --> 00:18:12,371
Martha, rubbing alcohol for you?

233
00:18:12,671 --> 00:18:14,671
Sure. Never mix, never worry!

234
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:27,871
Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?

235
00:18:30,371 --> 00:18:33,171
Wasn't that funny? That was so funny!

236
00:18:33,871 --> 00:18:34,671
Yes, it was.

237
00:18:34,871 --> 00:18:37,071
I thought I'd bust a gut!

238
00:18:40,271 --> 00:18:42,071
George didn't think it was funny.

239
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:45,871
Martha thinks that unless you
bust a gut you're not amused.

240
00:18:46,271 --> 00:18:48,871
Unless you carry on like a hyena
you're not having fun.

241
00:18:49,271 --> 00:18:52,071
I certainly had fun.
It was a wonderful party!

242
00:18:52,371 --> 00:18:56,371
- It certainly was.
- Your father, he is so wonderful!

243
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,571
He's quite a guy, isn't he?

244
00:19:01,971 --> 00:19:03,271
You better believe it.

245
00:19:03,571 --> 00:19:05,071
He's a marvelous man.

246
00:19:05,471 --> 00:19:07,571
I'm not tearing him down.
We know he's a god.

247
00:19:07,971 --> 00:19:09,271
You lay off my father.

248
00:19:09,571 --> 00:19:12,571
When you've had as many
faculty parties as I have...

249
00:19:12,971 --> 00:19:14,271
I rather appreciated it.

250
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,871
I mean aside from enjoying it,
I appreciated it.

251
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:23,871
Meeting, introducing, how he had us
stay at the Inn till our place is ready.

252
00:19:24,671 --> 00:19:25,871
When I taught in Kansas...

253
00:19:26,171 --> 00:19:27,571
You won't believe it...

254
00:19:27,771 --> 00:19:32,771
...but we had to make our way all by
ourselves. Isn't that right, dear?

255
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:34,971
We had to make our own way.

256
00:19:35,171 --> 00:19:39,471
I'd have to go up to the wives
in the library or the supermarket...

257
00:19:39,771 --> 00:19:42,271
...and say, "Hello, I am new here."

258
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:46,071
"You must be Mrs. So-and-so,
Doctor So-and-so's wife."

259
00:19:46,271 --> 00:19:48,571
It really wasn't very nice at all.

260
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:53,971
Daddy knows how to run things.

261
00:19:54,771 --> 00:19:56,171
He's a remarkable man.

262
00:19:56,471 --> 00:19:57,771
You bet your sweet life.

263
00:19:58,771 --> 00:19:59,971
I'll tell you a secret.

264
00:20:00,671 --> 00:20:05,171
There are easier things in this world,
if you teach at the university...

265
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,471
...than being married
to the daughter of...

266
00:20:07,871 --> 00:20:11,471
...the president of that university.
There are easier things.

267
00:20:11,871 --> 00:20:16,771
It's a great opportunity. For some men
it would be the chance of a lifetime.

268
00:20:16,971 --> 00:20:20,471
There are, believe me,
easier things in this world.

269
00:20:20,871 --> 00:20:23,471
Some men would give their right arm
for the chance!

270
00:20:23,871 --> 00:20:28,371
In reality that sacrifice is of a more
private portion of the anatomy.

271
00:20:30,671 --> 00:20:32,371
Could you show me where the...

272
00:20:32,871 --> 00:20:33,671
Are you all right?

273
00:20:34,071 --> 00:20:38,171
Of course, dear. I just want to
put some powder on my nose.

274
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,871
Show her where we keep the euphemism?

275
00:20:45,071 --> 00:20:47,871
I'm sorry. I want to show you
the house anyway.

276
00:20:48,571 --> 00:20:50,071
We'll be back, dear.

277
00:20:51,171 --> 00:20:53,571
Honestly, George, you burn me up!

278
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:55,171
You really do!

279
00:20:57,171 --> 00:20:59,571
Don't shoot your mouth off
about you-know-what.

280
00:21:00,171 --> 00:21:03,171
I'll talk about
any goddamn thing I want to!

281
00:21:03,571 --> 00:21:04,671
Okay, vanish!

282
00:21:05,071 --> 00:21:07,371
Any goddamn thing I want!

283
00:21:37,571 --> 00:21:38,871
What'll it be?

284
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:40,571
I'll stick to bourbon.

285
00:21:48,071 --> 00:21:50,271
You're in the Math Department?

286
00:21:50,471 --> 00:21:51,371
No.

287
00:21:55,771 --> 00:21:58,071
Martha said so.
I think that's what she said.

288
00:22:05,071 --> 00:22:06,771
Why'd you decide to be a teacher?

289
00:22:08,471 --> 00:22:11,071
The same things that motivated you,
I imagine.

290
00:22:11,471 --> 00:22:12,771
Oh? What were they?

291
00:22:13,971 --> 00:22:15,971
What were the things that motivated me?

292
00:22:16,771 --> 00:22:18,271
Well, I'm sure I don't know.

293
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:21,271
You said the things that motivated you
and me were the same.

294
00:22:21,671 --> 00:22:22,971
I said I imagined they were.

295
00:22:23,471 --> 00:22:24,571
Oh, did you?

296
00:22:35,971 --> 00:22:37,271
You like it here?

297
00:22:39,271 --> 00:22:40,471
Yes, it's fine.

298
00:22:40,771 --> 00:22:42,171
I meant the university.

299
00:22:43,871 --> 00:22:46,071
I know. I meant the university.

300
00:22:47,171 --> 00:22:48,971
Well, I like it fine.

301
00:23:02,371 --> 00:23:05,971
You've been here for quite a long time,
haven't you?

302
00:23:10,971 --> 00:23:15,171
Oh, yes. Ever since I married
what's-her-name. Martha.

303
00:23:16,371 --> 00:23:18,871
Even before that. Forever.

304
00:23:19,371 --> 00:23:21,171
Dashed hopes and good intentions.

305
00:23:22,171 --> 00:23:25,171
Good, better, best, bested!

306
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:29,171
How do you like that for a declension?

307
00:23:29,671 --> 00:23:31,071
You didn't answer my question.

308
00:23:32,071 --> 00:23:36,571
Don't condescend. I asked you
how you liked that declension.

309
00:23:38,671 --> 00:23:40,071
I don't know what to say.

310
00:23:40,571 --> 00:23:41,871
You don't know what to say?

311
00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:45,871
Shall I say it's funny,
so you can say it's sad?

312
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:50,871
Or shall I say it's sad so you can say
it's funny? You can play that game!

313
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,371
- Very good!
- I think we'll just...

314
00:23:53,871 --> 00:23:56,371
Now, calm down. Just calm down.
All right?

315
00:23:56,771 --> 00:23:57,871
Another drink? Here.

316
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,571
I still have one.
And when my wife comes down...

317
00:24:02,271 --> 00:24:06,871
What I mean is, you and your wife
seem to be having some sort of a...

318
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:11,271
Martha and I are having nothing.
Martha and I are merely exercising.

319
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:14,771
We're walking what's left of our wits.
Pay no attention.

320
00:24:15,071 --> 00:24:17,071
Now let's sit down and talk, huh?

321
00:24:17,771 --> 00:24:21,571
It's just I don't like to become
involved in other people's affairs.

322
00:24:22,071 --> 00:24:25,771
You'll get over that. Small college.
Musical beds is the faculty sport.

323
00:24:26,071 --> 00:24:26,971
Sir?

324
00:24:27,271 --> 00:24:30,071
Never mind. I wish you wouldn't go
"sir." How old are you?

325
00:24:30,571 --> 00:24:31,571
Twenty-eight.

326
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:33,071
I'm forty-something.

327
00:24:34,171 --> 00:24:36,571
Aren't you surprised?
Don't I look older?

328
00:24:39,071 --> 00:24:40,471
I think you look fine.

329
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:44,071
I've always been lean. I play handball.
How much do you weigh?

330
00:24:45,571 --> 00:24:48,471
155,160, something like that?
You play handball?

331
00:24:48,771 --> 00:24:50,671
- Not very well.
- We'll play sometime.

332
00:24:50,871 --> 00:24:55,271
Martha is 108... years old.
She weighs somewhat more than that.

333
00:24:55,571 --> 00:24:56,571
How old is your wife?

334
00:24:57,971 --> 00:24:59,271
She's twenty-six.

335
00:24:59,671 --> 00:25:03,171
Martha is a remarkable woman.
I imagine she weighs around 110.

336
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:04,471
Your wife weighs...

337
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:07,271
No, my boy, your wife.
My wife is Martha.

338
00:25:07,971 --> 00:25:09,271
Yes, I know.

339
00:25:09,771 --> 00:25:12,971
If you were married to Martha
you'd know what it means.

340
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,971
If I were married to your wife,
I'd know what that means.

341
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:24,271
Martha says you are in
the Math Department or something.

342
00:25:25,771 --> 00:25:26,771
No, I'm not.

343
00:25:27,171 --> 00:25:30,271
She's seldom mistaken.
Maybe you should be in it.

344
00:25:31,171 --> 00:25:33,771
I'm a biologist.
I'm in the Biology Department.

345
00:25:38,671 --> 00:25:42,971
You're the one's going to make all
that trouble making everyone the same.

346
00:25:43,371 --> 00:25:46,471
Rearranging the chromozones,
or whatever it is, right?

347
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,471
Not exactly. Chromosomes.

348
00:25:49,971 --> 00:25:51,171
I'm very mistrustful.

349
00:25:52,471 --> 00:25:55,971
You think we learn nothing from history?
I'm in the History Department.

350
00:25:56,771 --> 00:25:57,671
Yes, I know.

351
00:25:57,871 --> 00:26:00,371
Martha tells me I'm in
the History Department...

352
00:26:00,671 --> 00:26:05,171
...as opposed to being the History
Department, in the sense of running it.

353
00:26:05,471 --> 00:26:08,371
I do not run the History Department.

354
00:26:08,671 --> 00:26:10,571
I don't run the Biology Department.

355
00:26:10,771 --> 00:26:12,371
You're twenty-one. Twenty-eight.

356
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:16,871
Perhaps when you're forty-something
you'll run the History Department.

357
00:26:17,671 --> 00:26:19,071
Biology Department.

358
00:26:19,571 --> 00:26:22,071
I'm really very mistrustful!

359
00:26:22,871 --> 00:26:26,871
I read somewhere that science fiction
is not really fiction at all.

360
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:31,371
That you rearrange my genes so that
everyone will be like everyone else.

361
00:26:31,671 --> 00:26:34,571
I suspect we shall not have
much music or painting.

362
00:26:35,271 --> 00:26:39,571
But we'll have a civilization of
sublime young men much like yourself.

363
00:26:39,871 --> 00:26:44,071
Cultures and races will vanish.
The ants will take over the world.

364
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:46,571
Don't know much about science, do you?

365
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:49,771
I know history.
I know when I'm being threatened.

366
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:54,071
Your wife doesn't have any hips,
does she?

367
00:26:56,071 --> 00:27:00,371
I'm not hip-happy. I was implying
that your wife is slim-hipped.

368
00:27:01,771 --> 00:27:02,971
Yes, she is.

369
00:27:03,571 --> 00:27:04,571
You got any kids?

370
00:27:05,271 --> 00:27:07,071
No. Not yet. You?

371
00:27:07,371 --> 00:27:08,871
For me to know and you to find out.

372
00:27:12,271 --> 00:27:13,671
No kids, huh?

373
00:27:14,571 --> 00:27:15,371
What's wrong?

374
00:27:16,071 --> 00:27:18,871
Nothing. We wanted to wait
till we're settled.

375
00:27:22,471 --> 00:27:24,071
Think you'll be happy
here at New Carthage?

376
00:27:24,771 --> 00:27:28,071
Well, we hope to stay here.
I don't mean forever.

377
00:27:28,571 --> 00:27:31,771
Don't bandy that about.
The Old Man wouldn't like it.

378
00:27:33,471 --> 00:27:37,571
Martha's father expects his staff
to come here and grow old...

379
00:27:37,971 --> 00:27:40,371
...and fall in the line of service.

380
00:27:40,571 --> 00:27:42,771
One man, a professor of Latin...

381
00:27:43,071 --> 00:27:45,771
...actually fell in the
cafeteria line one lunch.

382
00:27:46,071 --> 00:27:49,671
But the Old Man isn't falling anywhere.
He isn't going to die.

383
00:27:50,471 --> 00:27:51,771
There are rumors...

384
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:55,771
...which you can't breathe to Martha
for she foams at the mouth...

385
00:27:56,271 --> 00:27:57,771
...that the Old Man, her father...

386
00:27:58,171 --> 00:28:01,271
...is over two hundred years old.

387
00:28:01,771 --> 00:28:04,971
There's an irony there, but I'm not
drunk enough to figure it out.

388
00:28:08,671 --> 00:28:09,671
Damnit!

389
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:13,671
I wonder what women talk about
when men talk. I must find out.

390
00:28:14,271 --> 00:28:15,971
What do you want?

391
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:20,171
Isn't that a wonderful sound?

392
00:28:20,971 --> 00:28:22,371
How many kids you having?

393
00:28:23,371 --> 00:28:24,971
I don't know. My wife is...

394
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:28,171
Slim-hipped.
Well, there's one of you at least.

395
00:28:28,471 --> 00:28:33,171
You must see this house, dear.
This is such a wonderful old house.

396
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,971
For Christ's sake, hang on a minute!

397
00:28:37,171 --> 00:28:38,971
She'll be right down, she's changing.

398
00:28:39,371 --> 00:28:41,371
She's changing? What, her clothes?

399
00:28:41,571 --> 00:28:42,971
- Her dress.
- Why?

400
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:45,971
I imagine that she wants
to be comfortable.

401
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:47,871
Oh, she does, does she?

402
00:28:48,171 --> 00:28:49,671
You don't know!

403
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,671
- You all right, dear?
- Yes, dear, perfectly fine.

404
00:28:55,371 --> 00:28:56,871
She wants to be comfortable?

405
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:58,871
Well, we'll see about that!

406
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:01,171
I didn't know that you had a son.

407
00:29:04,371 --> 00:29:07,371
- A son. I hadn't known.
- You to know and me to find out, huh?

408
00:29:07,671 --> 00:29:10,371
Tomorrow is his birthday.
He will be sixteen.

409
00:29:11,971 --> 00:29:12,871
She told you?

410
00:29:13,971 --> 00:29:15,671
- She told you about him?
- Yes.

411
00:29:16,871 --> 00:29:18,471
You said she's changing?

412
00:29:19,471 --> 00:29:21,371
- And she mentioned...
- Your son's birthday.

413
00:29:26,171 --> 00:29:27,771
You look pale. Would you like...

414
00:29:28,071 --> 00:29:31,571
Yes, dear a little more brandy maybe.
Just a drop.

415
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:33,571
The bar?

416
00:29:34,071 --> 00:29:37,871
Yes, by all means, drink away.
You'll need it as years go on.

417
00:29:39,371 --> 00:29:41,271
Damn destructive...

418
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,071
What time is it, dear?

419
00:29:44,471 --> 00:29:46,571
- 2:30.
- So late!

420
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:48,071
We should get home.

421
00:29:48,571 --> 00:29:50,071
Keeping the baby sitter up?

422
00:29:51,871 --> 00:29:53,371
I said we didn't have children.

423
00:29:54,271 --> 00:29:56,271
Sorry, I wasn't even listening.

424
00:29:56,571 --> 00:29:58,371
Or thinking. Whichever applies.

425
00:29:59,271 --> 00:30:00,371
We'll go in a while.

426
00:30:00,771 --> 00:30:02,271
No, you mustn't!

427
00:30:02,671 --> 00:30:07,771
Martha is changing, and not for me.
Martha hasn't changed for me in years.

428
00:30:08,071 --> 00:30:12,071
It means we're going to be here days.
You're being accorded an honor.

429
00:30:12,471 --> 00:30:16,571
Don't forget Martha is the daughter
of our beloved boss... his right arm.

430
00:30:17,271 --> 00:30:19,971
I'd use another word,
but leave that sort of talk to Martha.

431
00:30:20,471 --> 00:30:21,771
What sort of talk?

432
00:30:25,971 --> 00:30:26,971
Well, now!

433
00:30:29,271 --> 00:30:31,371
Why, Martha, your Sunday chapel dress!

434
00:30:31,771 --> 00:30:34,071
Oh, that's most attractive!

435
00:30:34,471 --> 00:30:35,771
You like it? Good.

436
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:39,771
What do you mean screaming
up the stairs at me?

437
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:43,071
We got lonely for the soft purr
of your little voice.

438
00:30:43,771 --> 00:30:46,571
Well, you just trot over
to the bar-ie-poo...

439
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:49,971
...and make your little mommy
a gweat big dwink.

440
00:30:50,271 --> 00:30:51,471
That's right!

441
00:30:54,871 --> 00:30:59,271
You're quite a guy, getting your masters
when you were what, 12?

442
00:31:00,171 --> 00:31:02,571
- Hear that, George?
- 12 and a half, actually.

443
00:31:03,471 --> 00:31:04,471
19, really.

444
00:31:04,671 --> 00:31:07,571
- You needn't have mentioned it.
- I'm proud of you!

445
00:31:07,771 --> 00:31:10,071
- I'm very impressed.
- You're damn right!

446
00:31:10,271 --> 00:31:14,171
I'm wracked with jealousy.
What do you want me to do, throw up?

447
00:31:15,471 --> 00:31:18,171
That's very impressive.
You should be proud.

448
00:31:18,471 --> 00:31:20,471
He's a pretty nice fellow.

449
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,271
You might take over
the History Department.

450
00:31:23,471 --> 00:31:24,771
Biology Department.

451
00:31:25,471 --> 00:31:27,171
Yes. I'm preoccupied with history.

452
00:31:29,171 --> 00:31:31,971
What a remark.
"I am preoccupied with history."

453
00:31:34,471 --> 00:31:38,471
George is not. George is preoccupied
with the History Department.

454
00:31:38,971 --> 00:31:40,971
He's preoccupied with it...

455
00:31:41,371 --> 00:31:45,471
...because he is not the
History Department, he is only in it.

456
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:48,371
We went through that
while you were upstairs.

457
00:31:48,671 --> 00:31:50,471
That's right, baby, keep it clean.

458
00:31:51,371 --> 00:31:54,171
George is bogged down
in the History Department.

459
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:57,871
He's an old bog
in the History Department.

460
00:31:58,371 --> 00:31:59,871
That's what George is...

461
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:04,071
...A bog, a fen, a G.D. Swamp!

462
00:32:07,571 --> 00:32:09,971
Hey, swamp! Hey, swampy!

463
00:32:15,071 --> 00:32:16,171
Can I get you something?

464
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:19,171
Well, sure.

465
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:23,371
You can light my cigarette
if you're of a mind to.

466
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:25,671
No. There are limits.

467
00:32:26,571 --> 00:32:28,071
A man puts up with only so much...

468
00:32:28,371 --> 00:32:32,071
...before he descends on the
evolutionary ladder which is your line.

469
00:32:32,871 --> 00:32:36,671
I'll hold your hand when it's dark
and you're afraid of the bogeyman.

470
00:32:37,071 --> 00:32:40,071
And I'll tote your gin bottles
out after midnight so no one sees.

471
00:32:40,371 --> 00:32:44,671
But I will not light your cigarette.
And that, as they say, is that.

472
00:32:50,871 --> 00:32:53,071
Hey, you played football, huh?

473
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,271
Yes, I was a quarterback.

474
00:32:55,471 --> 00:32:57,871
But I was much more adept at boxing.

475
00:32:58,771 --> 00:33:01,371
Boxing? You hear that, George?

476
00:33:02,971 --> 00:33:06,071
Must've been good. Doesn't look
like you got hit in the face.

477
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:09,271
He was intercollegiate state
middleweight champion.

478
00:33:11,071 --> 00:33:14,271
Still looks like you have a
pretty good body, is that right?

479
00:33:14,471 --> 00:33:15,871
Decency forbids...

480
00:33:16,071 --> 00:33:17,271
Shut up!

481
00:33:17,771 --> 00:33:20,771
Is that right?
Have you kept your body up?

482
00:33:21,271 --> 00:33:23,771
It's still pretty good. I work out.

483
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:28,071
Yes, he has a very firm body.

484
00:33:28,671 --> 00:33:31,071
Have you? I think that's very nice.

485
00:33:31,471 --> 00:33:34,071
You know, once you have it,
you never know...

486
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:35,971
...when it'll come in handy!

487
00:33:38,671 --> 00:33:41,071
I say, why give it up until you have to?

488
00:33:44,871 --> 00:33:47,071
I couldn't agree with you more!

489
00:33:47,471 --> 00:33:49,071
Your obscenity is beyond human...

490
00:33:49,471 --> 00:33:52,271
George here doesn't cotton
too much to body talk.

491
00:33:52,571 --> 00:33:57,471
Paunchy isn't happy when the talk
moves to muscles. How much you weigh?

492
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:00,771
155,150...

493
00:34:01,971 --> 00:34:04,971
Still at the old middleweight limit?
That's pretty good!

494
00:34:08,871 --> 00:34:11,171
Tell them about the boxing match we had.

495
00:34:12,971 --> 00:34:13,771
Christ!

496
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:16,771
Tell them about it.

497
00:34:17,071 --> 00:34:19,171
You tell them, you're good at it.

498
00:34:19,571 --> 00:34:22,271
- Is he all right?
- Him? Oh, sure.

499
00:34:23,371 --> 00:34:25,071
We had this boxing match...

500
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:27,271
...a couple years after we married.

501
00:34:27,671 --> 00:34:29,671
A boxing match? The two of you?

502
00:34:30,871 --> 00:34:32,771
Yeah, the two of us. Really.

503
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,371
I can't imagine it!

504
00:34:35,671 --> 00:34:38,371
Well, it wasn't in a ring
or anything like that.

505
00:34:39,071 --> 00:34:41,371
Daddy was on this physical fitness kick.

506
00:34:42,071 --> 00:34:45,671
He had a couple of us over one Sunday
and we all went out back...

507
00:34:46,071 --> 00:34:50,171
...and Daddy put the gloves on himself
and asked George to box with him.

508
00:34:52,071 --> 00:34:53,971
And George didn't want to.

509
00:34:54,771 --> 00:34:59,771
So Daddy said, "Come on, young man!
What sort of a son-in-law are you?"

510
00:35:01,371 --> 00:35:05,171
And while this was going on,
I don't know why I did it...

511
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:08,071
...I got into a pair of gloves myself...

512
00:35:08,271 --> 00:35:12,671
...and I snuck up behind George,
just kidding and yelled, "Hey, George!"

513
00:35:13,371 --> 00:35:17,371
And let go with a sort of roundhouse
right. Just kidding, you know.

514
00:35:18,271 --> 00:35:22,771
And George wheeled around real quick
and caught it right in the jaw!

515
00:35:25,871 --> 00:35:28,471
He caught it right in the jaw!

516
00:35:29,571 --> 00:35:33,971
He was off-balance. He must have been.
And then he landed...

517
00:35:34,171 --> 00:35:36,671
...flat in a huckleberry bush!

518
00:35:59,671 --> 00:36:00,671
Pow, you're dead.

519
00:36:07,471 --> 00:36:09,371
Where'd you get that, you bastard?

520
00:36:09,771 --> 00:36:12,371
I've had it awhile. Liked that, did
you?

521
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:13,771
Bastard!

522
00:36:16,471 --> 00:36:19,471
Oh, that was pretty good.
Hey, give me a kiss.

523
00:36:19,771 --> 00:36:22,271
- Later, sweetie.
- Give me a kiss.

524
00:36:27,071 --> 00:36:30,471
So that's what you're after?
We having blue games for the guests?

525
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:34,071
Everything in its place.
Everything in it's own good time.

526
00:36:34,971 --> 00:36:36,971
Drinks now. Drinks for all.

527
00:36:37,271 --> 00:36:39,271
You've nibbled away at your glass.

528
00:36:40,171 --> 00:36:43,471
I need something.
I was never so frightened in my life.

529
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:45,371
Weren't you frightened?

530
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:49,571
- I don't remember.
- I bet you were.

531
00:36:49,871 --> 00:36:51,671
Did you think I was going to kill you?

532
00:36:51,971 --> 00:36:54,471
You? Kill me? That's a laugh!

533
00:36:54,871 --> 00:36:55,971
I might some day.

534
00:36:57,471 --> 00:36:58,671
Fat chance!

535
00:36:58,971 --> 00:37:00,271
Where's the john?

536
00:37:01,371 --> 00:37:02,471
Down the hall and right.

537
00:37:02,871 --> 00:37:05,271
Don't come back with
any guns or anything.

538
00:37:06,171 --> 00:37:08,271
You don't need any props,
do you, baby?

539
00:37:08,871 --> 00:37:10,271
I'll bet not.

540
00:37:10,471 --> 00:37:13,771
- No fake gun for you!
- May I leave my drink here?

541
00:37:14,171 --> 00:37:17,771
Why not? We've got half-filled glasses
wherever Martha left them.

542
00:37:17,971 --> 00:37:20,971
In the closet, the bathtub.
I found one in the freezer.

543
00:37:21,171 --> 00:37:24,171
- Oh, you did not!
- Yes, I did.

544
00:37:27,071 --> 00:37:29,571
- Brandy gives you no hangover?
- I never mix.

545
00:37:29,771 --> 00:37:33,171
- I don't drink very much either.
- Oh, good.

546
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:36,671
Your husband was telling us
about chromosomes.

547
00:37:37,671 --> 00:37:40,971
- Chromosomes. He's a biologist.
- He's in the Math Department.

548
00:37:41,171 --> 00:37:43,671
- Biologist.
- He's in the Math Department!

549
00:37:45,671 --> 00:37:46,871
Biology.

550
00:37:48,571 --> 00:37:49,871
Are you sure?

551
00:37:50,271 --> 00:37:52,371
Well, I ought to be sure.

552
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:56,571
So he's a biologist. Good for him!

553
00:37:57,571 --> 00:37:59,171
Biology's even better.

554
00:37:59,871 --> 00:38:02,871
It's at the meat of things.
You're at the meat of things.

555
00:38:03,371 --> 00:38:07,171
- She thought you were Math Department.
- Maybe I ought to be.

556
00:38:07,571 --> 00:38:11,171
You stay right where you are.
Stay right at the meat of things.

557
00:38:11,871 --> 00:38:14,371
You're obsessed by that phrase.
It's ugly.

558
00:38:14,771 --> 00:38:16,071
You stay right there.

559
00:38:17,271 --> 00:38:21,171
You can take over the History Department
as easy from there as any place else.

560
00:38:21,971 --> 00:38:25,171
Somebody's got to take over
the History Department some day.

561
00:38:25,571 --> 00:38:28,871
And it ain't gonna be Georgie-boy
over there, that's for sure.

562
00:38:29,271 --> 00:38:31,771
Are you swampy, are you?

563
00:38:32,571 --> 00:38:35,571
In my mind you are bedded in cement
up to the neck.

564
00:38:36,271 --> 00:38:37,871
No, up to the nose, it's quieter.

565
00:38:45,071 --> 00:38:46,271
When is your son...

566
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:48,271
What?

567
00:38:48,371 --> 00:38:49,771
Something about your son.

568
00:38:54,971 --> 00:38:56,971
When is your son coming home?

569
00:39:04,471 --> 00:39:05,771
When's our son coming home?

570
00:39:06,171 --> 00:39:06,971
Never mind.

571
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:10,571
I want to know. You brought it up.
When's he coming home?

572
00:39:11,671 --> 00:39:14,271
I said never mind.
I'm sorry I brought it up.

573
00:39:14,571 --> 00:39:17,971
Him up! Not it! You brought him up,
more or less.

574
00:39:18,471 --> 00:39:21,771
When's the little bugger appearing?
Isn't tomorrow his birthday?

575
00:39:22,171 --> 00:39:23,971
I don't want to talk about it.

576
00:39:24,671 --> 00:39:26,671
I don't want to talk about it!

577
00:39:26,871 --> 00:39:29,271
She doesn't want to talk about it, him.

578
00:39:29,471 --> 00:39:32,371
Martha is sorry she brought it up. Him.

579
00:39:32,671 --> 00:39:34,971
When's the little bugger coming home?

580
00:39:36,871 --> 00:39:40,971
Since you had the bad taste to
bring it up, when is the bugger coming?

581
00:39:41,471 --> 00:39:44,671
George talks disparagingly about
the little bugger...

582
00:39:44,971 --> 00:39:46,971
...because he has problems.

583
00:39:47,171 --> 00:39:49,371
What problems has the little bugger got?

584
00:39:49,571 --> 00:39:52,271
Not the little bugger.
Stop calling him that!

585
00:39:52,671 --> 00:39:57,471
- You! You've got problems!
- Never heard anything more ridiculous.

586
00:39:57,971 --> 00:39:59,471
Neither have I!

587
00:40:01,071 --> 00:40:04,171
George's biggest problem
about the... about our son...

588
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:08,371
...about our great big son is that deep
down in the private pit of his gut...

589
00:40:08,671 --> 00:40:11,871
...he is not completely sure that it's
his own kid.

590
00:40:12,171 --> 00:40:14,171
My God, you're a wicked woman!

591
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:18,671
And I've told you a million times,
I wouldn't conceive with anyone else.

592
00:40:19,071 --> 00:40:20,871
A deeply wicked person.

593
00:40:22,271 --> 00:40:24,471
I'm not sure this is a subject for...

594
00:40:24,671 --> 00:40:28,471
Martha's lying. I want you
to know that Martha is lying.

595
00:40:29,371 --> 00:40:32,171
There are few things I am certain of,
but the one thing...

596
00:40:32,371 --> 00:40:34,971
...in this sinking world
that I am sure of...

597
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:38,371
...is my partnership,
my chromosomoligical partnership...

598
00:40:38,571 --> 00:40:42,771
...in the creation of our blond-eyed,
blue-haired son.

599
00:40:43,871 --> 00:40:45,171
I'm so glad.

600
00:40:46,271 --> 00:40:49,371
- A very pretty speech, George.
- Thank you, Martha.

601
00:40:49,671 --> 00:40:52,971
You rose to the occasion good.
Real good.

602
00:40:53,371 --> 00:40:54,671
Well. Real well!

603
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:57,771
Martha knows better.

604
00:40:58,071 --> 00:41:00,871
Yes, I've been to college
like everybody else.

605
00:41:01,171 --> 00:41:04,671
George, our son does not
have blue hair.

606
00:41:04,971 --> 00:41:08,371
Or blue eyes for that matter.
He has green eyes like me.

607
00:41:08,671 --> 00:41:10,971
Beautiful, beautiful green eyes.

608
00:41:11,671 --> 00:41:12,671
He has blue eyes.

609
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:13,771
Green.

610
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:14,971
Blue, Martha.

611
00:41:15,371 --> 00:41:16,771
Green, you bastard!

612
00:41:17,771 --> 00:41:19,971
Tut-tut yourself, you old floozy.

613
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:21,971
He's not a floozie.

614
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:25,571
He can't be a floozie.
You're a floozie.

615
00:41:25,871 --> 00:41:27,771
Now you just watch yourself!

616
00:41:28,171 --> 00:41:29,571
All right!

617
00:41:30,171 --> 00:41:33,371
I'd like another little nipper
of brandy please.

618
00:41:33,671 --> 00:41:35,571
- I think you've had enough.
- Nonsense!

619
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:38,471
- We're all ready, I think.
- Nonsense!

620
00:41:41,171 --> 00:41:45,171
George has watery blue eyes,
kind of milky blue.

621
00:41:45,371 --> 00:41:46,771
Make up your mind.

622
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:50,671
I gave you the benefit of a doubt.
Daddy has green eyes too.

623
00:41:50,871 --> 00:41:55,371
No, he has tiny red eyes, like a white
mouse. In fact, he is a white mouse.

624
00:41:56,571 --> 00:41:59,571
You wouldn't say that if he was here.
You're a coward!

625
00:41:59,871 --> 00:42:03,271
You know that shock of white hair
and these beady red eyes?

626
00:42:03,571 --> 00:42:05,271
A great big white mouse.

627
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:10,571
George hates Daddy. Not for anything
Daddy's done to him, but for his own...

628
00:42:10,871 --> 00:42:12,071
Inadequacies?

629
00:42:12,371 --> 00:42:15,371
That's right.
You hit it right on the snout!

630
00:42:15,871 --> 00:42:18,571
You know why the S.O.B.
Hates my father?

631
00:42:18,871 --> 00:42:22,271
When George came to the History
Department, about 500 years ago...

632
00:42:22,571 --> 00:42:23,771
...Daddy approved of him.

633
00:42:24,271 --> 00:42:28,271
And you want to know what I did,
dumb cluck that I am?

634
00:42:28,571 --> 00:42:30,471
I fell for him!

635
00:42:30,871 --> 00:42:32,271
I like that!

636
00:42:32,571 --> 00:42:34,571
She did, you should have seen it.

637
00:42:34,771 --> 00:42:38,271
She'd sit outside my room at night
and howl and claw at the turf.

638
00:42:38,571 --> 00:42:40,371
I couldn't work so I married her.

639
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:44,571
I actually fell for him.

640
00:42:45,071 --> 00:42:46,971
It! That! There!

641
00:42:47,271 --> 00:42:48,771
Martha's a romantic at heart.

642
00:42:50,471 --> 00:42:51,571
That I am.

643
00:42:53,471 --> 00:42:57,771
I actually fell for him.
And the match seemed practical too.

644
00:42:58,571 --> 00:43:01,471
For a while Daddy thought
George had the stuff...

645
00:43:01,771 --> 00:43:03,971
...to take over when
he was ready to retire.

646
00:43:05,471 --> 00:43:07,171
- Stop it!
- What do you want?!

647
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:10,371
- I wouldn't go on if I were you.
- You wouldn't? Well, you're not!

648
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:13,371
You've already sprung a leak
about you-know-what.

649
00:43:13,871 --> 00:43:14,671
What?

650
00:43:14,771 --> 00:43:16,971
About the little bugger. Our son.

651
00:43:17,271 --> 00:43:19,271
If you start in on this, I warn you...

652
00:43:19,671 --> 00:43:22,471
- I stand warned.
- Do we have to go through this?

653
00:43:22,971 --> 00:43:26,171
Anyway, I married the S.O.B.
I had it all planned out.

654
00:43:26,371 --> 00:43:30,671
First he'd take over the History
Department, then the whole college.

655
00:43:30,971 --> 00:43:32,671
That's how it was supposed to be!

656
00:43:32,971 --> 00:43:33,971
Getting angry?

657
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:37,471
That was how it was supposed to be.
All very simple.

658
00:43:37,871 --> 00:43:40,671
Daddy thought it was a good idea too.
For a while!

659
00:43:40,971 --> 00:43:43,671
Until he started watching
for a couple of years.

660
00:43:43,971 --> 00:43:44,971
Getting angry?

661
00:43:45,371 --> 00:43:47,371
Till he watched for a couple years...

662
00:43:47,671 --> 00:43:50,371
...and started thinking
it wasn't such a good idea.

663
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:53,671
That maybe Georgie-boy
didn't have the stuff!

664
00:43:54,171 --> 00:43:55,871
That he didn't have it in him!

665
00:43:56,071 --> 00:43:58,471
- Stop it, Martha!
- Like hell, I will!

666
00:43:59,571 --> 00:44:02,671
George didn't have much push.
He wasn't aggressive.

667
00:44:03,471 --> 00:44:05,471
In fact, he was sort of a flop!

668
00:44:06,171 --> 00:44:08,371
A great big, fat flop!

669
00:44:09,371 --> 00:44:10,871
I said stop it!

670
00:44:11,171 --> 00:44:15,571
I hope that was an empty bottle.
You can't afford to waste good liquor.

671
00:44:15,871 --> 00:44:19,671
Not on your salary! Not on
an associate professor's salary!

672
00:44:20,571 --> 00:44:23,671
So here I am, stuck with this flop...

673
00:44:24,071 --> 00:44:26,371
...this bog in the History Department.

674
00:44:26,671 --> 00:44:29,171
Who's married
to the president's daughter...

675
00:44:29,571 --> 00:44:33,571
...who's expected to be somebody.
Not just a nobody!

676
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:37,571
A bookworm who's so
goddamn complacent...

677
00:44:37,871 --> 00:44:40,171
...he can't make anything
out of himself.

678
00:44:40,571 --> 00:44:43,871
That doesn't have the guts
to make anybody proud of him!

679
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:48,571
All right, George, stop it!

680
00:44:50,971 --> 00:44:52,571
I'm going to be sick!

681
00:45:25,271 --> 00:45:27,771
She'll be all right.
I'll make some coffee.

682
00:45:28,571 --> 00:45:31,271
- You sure?
- She'll be okay.

683
00:47:39,071 --> 00:47:40,771
I'm really very sorry.

684
00:47:44,271 --> 00:47:47,271
She really shouldn't drink.
She's frail.

685
00:47:50,771 --> 00:47:52,271
Slim-hipped, as you say.

686
00:47:55,771 --> 00:47:59,071
Where's my little yum-yum?
Where's Martha?

687
00:48:00,871 --> 00:48:03,771
I think she's going to make some coffee.

688
00:48:09,071 --> 00:48:10,871
She gets sick quite easily.

689
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:14,471
Martha? No, she hasn't been
sick a day in her life.

690
00:48:14,771 --> 00:48:17,071
Unless you count time
she spends in the rest home.

691
00:48:17,471 --> 00:48:18,971
No, no. My wife.

692
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:23,471
My wife gets sick quite easily.
Your wife is Martha.

693
00:48:26,971 --> 00:48:27,771
I know.

694
00:48:29,471 --> 00:48:31,971
She doesn't really spend any time
in a rest home?

695
00:48:33,471 --> 00:48:34,471
Your wife?

696
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,071
No, yours.

697
00:48:37,471 --> 00:48:38,271
Mine?

698
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,271
She doesn't. I would.

699
00:48:49,971 --> 00:48:52,671
If I were her... she... I would.

700
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:55,271
But then I'm not and so I don't.

701
00:48:57,771 --> 00:48:59,471
I'd like to, though.

702
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:03,971
It gets pretty bouncy
around here sometimes.

703
00:49:05,471 --> 00:49:06,671
Yes, I'm sure.

704
00:49:10,871 --> 00:49:13,571
- Your wife throws up a lot?
- I didn't say that.

705
00:49:13,871 --> 00:49:16,171
I said she gets sick quite easily.

706
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,971
By sick I thought that you meant she...

707
00:49:19,471 --> 00:49:22,471
It's true, actually.
She does throw up a lot.

708
00:49:22,771 --> 00:49:23,871
The word is often.

709
00:49:25,371 --> 00:49:27,971
Once she starts
there's practically no stopping.

710
00:49:29,971 --> 00:49:32,071
She'll go right on for hours.

711
00:49:35,071 --> 00:49:36,771
Not all the time.

712
00:49:38,971 --> 00:49:39,971
Regularly.

713
00:49:40,871 --> 00:49:43,071
- You can tell time by her?
- Just about.

714
00:49:56,071 --> 00:49:57,871
I married her because she was pregnant.

715
00:50:02,871 --> 00:50:05,171
But you said you didn't have
any children.

716
00:50:05,371 --> 00:50:06,871
She wasn't really. It was a...

717
00:50:08,971 --> 00:50:10,371
...hysterical pregnancy.

718
00:50:12,471 --> 00:50:15,671
She blew up and then she went down.

719
00:50:17,271 --> 00:50:19,471
And when she was up you married her?

720
00:50:21,171 --> 00:50:22,971
Then she went down.

721
00:50:45,771 --> 00:50:47,671
When I was 16...

722
00:50:48,971 --> 00:50:51,571
...and going to prep school,
during the Punic Wars...

723
00:50:54,171 --> 00:50:57,071
...a bunch of us would go to town
the first day of vacation...

724
00:50:57,371 --> 00:50:59,371
...before we fanned out to our homes.

725
00:51:01,871 --> 00:51:04,971
And in the evening
we would go to a gin mill...

726
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:07,871
...owned by the gangster-father
of one of us...

727
00:51:08,271 --> 00:51:12,271
...and we would drink with the grown-ups
and listen to the jazz.

728
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,871
And one time, in the bunch of us...

729
00:51:16,271 --> 00:51:17,771
...there was this...

730
00:51:18,371 --> 00:51:20,971
...boy who was 15...

731
00:51:21,771 --> 00:51:25,871
...and he had killed his mother
with a shotgun some years before.

732
00:51:27,271 --> 00:51:29,271
Completely accidentally...

733
00:51:29,571 --> 00:51:33,271
...without even an unconscious
motivation, I have no doubt at all.

734
00:51:35,371 --> 00:51:37,971
And this one time this boy
went with us and...

735
00:51:38,771 --> 00:51:40,971
...we ordered our drinks...

736
00:51:41,871 --> 00:51:44,171
...and when it came his turn he said...

737
00:51:44,771 --> 00:51:46,771
"I'll have bergin.

738
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:51,971
"Give me some bergin please.
Bergin and water."

739
00:51:55,071 --> 00:51:56,571
We all laughed.

740
00:51:57,571 --> 00:52:02,571
He was blond and he had the face
of a cherub, and we all laughed.

741
00:52:03,771 --> 00:52:07,271
And his cheeks went red
and the color rose in his neck.

742
00:52:07,771 --> 00:52:12,671
The waiter told people at the next table
what the boy said and they laughed...

743
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:17,671
...and then more people were told
and the laughter grew and grew.

744
00:52:22,871 --> 00:52:25,571
No one was laughing more than us...

745
00:52:25,871 --> 00:52:29,771
...and none of us more than the boy
who had shot his mother.

746
00:52:32,271 --> 00:52:36,371
And soon everyone in the gin mill
knew what the laughter was about...

747
00:52:36,771 --> 00:52:41,371
...and everyone started ordering bergin
and laughing when they ordered it.

748
00:52:42,571 --> 00:52:45,571
And soon, of course,
the laughter became less general...

749
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:50,271
...but it did not subside entirely
for a very long time.

750
00:52:50,571 --> 00:52:53,571
For always at this table or that...

751
00:52:54,071 --> 00:52:56,071
...someone would order bergin...

752
00:52:57,171 --> 00:53:00,971
...and a whole new area
of laughter would rise.

753
00:53:02,771 --> 00:53:04,271
We drank free that night.

754
00:53:05,471 --> 00:53:07,771
We were bought champagne
by the management...

755
00:53:08,071 --> 00:53:11,271
...by the gangster-father of one of us.

756
00:53:13,471 --> 00:53:17,071
And, of course,
we suffered the next day...

757
00:53:17,471 --> 00:53:21,771
...each of us alone,
on his train away from the city...

758
00:53:23,471 --> 00:53:27,271
...and each of us
with a grown-up's hangover.

759
00:53:29,771 --> 00:53:31,871
But it was the grandest day...

760
00:53:33,271 --> 00:53:34,671
...of my...

761
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,471
...youth.

762
00:53:49,571 --> 00:53:50,971
What happened to the boy?

763
00:53:54,071 --> 00:53:55,471
The boy who had shot his mother.

764
00:53:58,371 --> 00:53:59,271
I won't tell you.

765
00:54:02,571 --> 00:54:06,171
The next summer on a country road,
with his learner's permit...

766
00:54:06,371 --> 00:54:11,071
...and his father sitting to his right,
he swerved to avoid a porcupine...

767
00:54:12,171 --> 00:54:14,971
...and drove straight into a large tree.

768
00:54:17,271 --> 00:54:18,871
He was not killed, of course.

769
00:54:20,071 --> 00:54:23,471
In the hospital when he was conscious
and out of danger...

770
00:54:23,871 --> 00:54:26,371
...when they told him
his father was dead...

771
00:54:28,071 --> 00:54:30,971
...he began to laugh, I have been told.

772
00:54:32,371 --> 00:54:36,071
And his laughter grew
and would not stop.

773
00:54:38,071 --> 00:54:41,671
And it was not until after
they'd jammed a needle in his arm...

774
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:46,371
...not until his consciousness
had slipped away from him...

775
00:54:46,671 --> 00:54:50,371
...that his laughter subsided. Stopped.

776
00:54:52,571 --> 00:54:54,871
When he recovered
from his injuries enough...

777
00:54:55,271 --> 00:54:59,871
...so he could be moved without damage
should he struggle...

778
00:55:02,271 --> 00:55:04,271
...he was put in an asylum.

779
00:55:07,571 --> 00:55:09,271
That was thirty years ago.

780
00:55:10,971 --> 00:55:12,571
Is he still there?

781
00:55:14,571 --> 00:55:15,671
Oh, yes.

782
00:55:17,071 --> 00:55:19,271
I'm told that for these thirty years...

783
00:55:21,071 --> 00:55:22,871
...he has not uttered...

784
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:27,271
...one sound.

785
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:50,771
That's Big Martha.

786
00:55:51,671 --> 00:55:53,071
She's making coffee.

787
00:55:54,471 --> 00:55:58,071
For your hysterical wife,
who goes up and down.

788
00:55:59,171 --> 00:55:59,971
Went.

789
00:56:00,471 --> 00:56:01,971
Up and down.

790
00:56:02,471 --> 00:56:04,471
Went? And no more?

791
00:56:05,471 --> 00:56:07,571
No more. Nothing.

792
00:56:10,171 --> 00:56:12,871
Martha doesn't have
hysterical pregnancies.

793
00:56:13,671 --> 00:56:15,571
My wife had one.

794
00:56:15,771 --> 00:56:18,271
Martha doesn't have pregnancies at all.

795
00:56:21,971 --> 00:56:25,471
Do you have any other kids,
any daughters or anything?

796
00:56:26,971 --> 00:56:28,771
Do we have any what?

797
00:56:32,171 --> 00:56:34,271
I mean, do you only have
the one...

798
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,671
...kid, your son?

799
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:40,271
No, just one.

800
00:56:41,971 --> 00:56:43,271
One boy.

801
00:56:44,671 --> 00:56:46,071
Our son.

802
00:56:51,271 --> 00:56:52,571
That's nice.

803
00:56:55,171 --> 00:56:57,171
He's a comfort.

804
00:56:58,971 --> 00:57:00,371
He's a beanbag.

805
00:57:03,471 --> 00:57:04,471
A what?

806
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,471
A beanbag. You wouldn't understand.

807
00:57:08,871 --> 00:57:10,571
A beanbag!

808
00:57:10,771 --> 00:57:14,271
I heard! I didn't say I was deaf,
I said I didn't understand!

809
00:57:14,571 --> 00:57:19,371
- You didn't say that at all.
- I was implying I didn't understand.

810
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:22,871
- You're getting testy.
- I'm sorry!

811
00:57:23,071 --> 00:57:27,371
I just said our son, the apple of
our 3 eyes, Martha being a Cyclops...

812
00:57:27,871 --> 00:57:30,071
...our son is a beanbag,
and you get testy.

813
00:57:30,371 --> 00:57:33,671
It's late, I'm tired.
I've been drinking since 9 o'clock.

814
00:57:33,871 --> 00:57:37,271
My wife is vomiting.
There's been a lot of screaming here.

815
00:57:37,471 --> 00:57:39,771
You get testy, naturally.
Don't worry about it.

816
00:57:39,971 --> 00:57:43,171
Anybody coming here gets testy.
Don't be upset.

817
00:57:43,371 --> 00:57:45,571
- I'm not upset.
- You're testy.

818
00:57:50,071 --> 00:57:54,071
I'd like to set you straight
about something while we're out here.

819
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:57,071
About something Martha said.

820
00:57:58,471 --> 00:58:00,371
Hark! Forest sounds.

821
00:58:01,471 --> 00:58:02,771
Animal noises.

822
00:58:05,271 --> 00:58:07,271
Oh, well, here's nursie!

823
00:58:08,271 --> 00:58:10,571
We're sitting up, we're having coffee.

824
00:58:12,271 --> 00:58:14,271
Is there anything I should do?

825
00:58:14,571 --> 00:58:18,871
No, you just stay there
and listen to Georgie's side of things.

826
00:58:19,471 --> 00:58:21,071
Bore yourself to death!

827
00:58:21,371 --> 00:58:23,871
You clean up the mess you made in here?

828
00:58:24,271 --> 00:58:27,271
No, Martha, I did not
clean up the mess I made.

829
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:32,471
I've been trying for years
to clean up the mess I made.

830
00:58:32,771 --> 00:58:34,471
Have you been trying for years?

831
00:58:34,671 --> 00:58:36,771
Accommodation, adjustment...

832
00:58:37,271 --> 00:58:39,771
...those do seem to be
in the order of things.

833
00:58:39,971 --> 00:58:41,771
Don't put me in the same class with you.

834
00:58:42,071 --> 00:58:45,571
No, of course not.
I mean things are simpler for you.

835
00:58:46,771 --> 00:58:49,271
You marry a woman
because she's all blown up.

836
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:54,271
- Where I, in my old-fashioned way...
- There was more to it than that.

837
00:58:54,471 --> 00:58:56,371
Sure. I bet she has money too.

838
00:58:59,671 --> 00:59:00,471
Yes.

839
00:59:06,671 --> 00:59:08,271
You mean I was right? I hit it?

840
00:59:08,971 --> 00:59:12,871
My God, what archery! First try, too.
How about that?

841
00:59:13,471 --> 00:59:15,471
- There were other things.
- Yes.

842
00:59:15,671 --> 00:59:17,271
To compensate.

843
00:59:18,171 --> 00:59:19,971
There always are.

844
00:59:21,571 --> 00:59:22,371
Allow me.

845
00:59:25,171 --> 00:59:28,171
Tell me about your wife's money.

846
00:59:31,371 --> 00:59:32,271
No.

847
00:59:32,871 --> 00:59:34,271
Okay, don't.

848
00:59:38,371 --> 00:59:41,071
My father-in-law was a man of the Lord.

849
00:59:42,371 --> 00:59:43,771
And he was very rich.

850
00:59:44,371 --> 00:59:45,271
What faith?

851
00:59:47,971 --> 00:59:49,171
My father-in-law...

852
00:59:50,371 --> 00:59:53,471
...was called by God
when he was six or something.

853
00:59:55,471 --> 00:59:59,971
He started preaching, baptized people,
and he saved them and then...

854
01:00:01,971 --> 01:00:05,871
...he traveled around a lot and
became pretty famous. Not like...

855
01:00:07,471 --> 01:00:08,971
...some of them but...

856
01:00:10,671 --> 01:00:12,471
...pretty famous.

857
01:00:15,371 --> 01:00:17,871
When he died he had a lot of money.

858
01:00:18,971 --> 01:00:21,471
- God's money?
- No, his own.

859
01:00:22,571 --> 01:00:26,171
- What about God's money?
- He spent it and he saved his own.

860
01:00:27,871 --> 01:00:29,371
I think that's very nice.

861
01:00:32,571 --> 01:00:34,571
Martha has money because...

862
01:00:34,771 --> 01:00:37,571
...Martha's father's second wife...

863
01:00:37,771 --> 01:00:40,671
...not Martha's mother,
but after her mother died...

864
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:43,271
...was a very old lady...

865
01:00:43,471 --> 01:00:46,471
...who had warts, who was very rich.

866
01:00:47,071 --> 01:00:48,471
She was a witch!

867
01:00:50,171 --> 01:00:53,171
She was a good witch,
and she married the white mouse...

868
01:00:53,371 --> 01:00:55,671
...with the red eyes,
and he must have...

869
01:00:55,871 --> 01:00:58,671
...nibbled her warts
or something...

870
01:01:00,271 --> 01:01:04,271
...because she went up in a
puff of smoke almost immediately.

871
01:01:06,971 --> 01:01:10,771
And all that was left,
apart from some wart medicine...

872
01:01:10,971 --> 01:01:13,371
...was a big, fat will.

873
01:01:18,571 --> 01:01:21,471
Maybe my father-in-law...

874
01:01:21,771 --> 01:01:24,971
...and the witch with the warts
should have gotten together.

875
01:01:26,271 --> 01:01:28,271
Because he was a mouse too.

876
01:01:29,971 --> 01:01:31,871
- He was?
- Sure!

877
01:01:34,571 --> 01:01:36,471
He was a church mouse!

878
01:01:53,471 --> 01:01:55,371
Your wife never mentioned a stepmother.

879
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:57,871
Maybe it isn't true.

880
01:02:00,171 --> 01:02:03,271
You realize I've been
drawing you out on this stuff...

881
01:02:03,971 --> 01:02:07,671
...because you're a threat to me
and I want to get the goods on you.

882
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:08,871
Sure.

883
01:02:09,171 --> 01:02:11,171
I've warned you. You stand warned.

884
01:02:11,371 --> 01:02:12,971
I stand warned.

885
01:02:15,371 --> 01:02:18,471
You sneaky types
worry me the most, you know.

886
01:02:18,671 --> 01:02:21,571
You ineffectual sons of bitches,
you're the worst.

887
01:02:21,971 --> 01:02:25,771
I'm glad you don't believe me.
You've got history on your side.

888
01:02:27,171 --> 01:02:30,671
You've got history on your side.
I've got biology on mine.

889
01:02:31,171 --> 01:02:33,171
History, biology.

890
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:35,471
- I know the difference.
- You don't act it.

891
01:02:35,871 --> 01:02:39,971
We decided you'd take over the History
Department first, then the whole works.

892
01:02:40,171 --> 01:02:40,971
A step at a time.

893
01:02:44,471 --> 01:02:49,371
What I thought I'd do is sort of
insinuate myself generally. You know!

894
01:02:49,671 --> 01:02:51,371
Find all the weak spots.

895
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,771
Like me.

896
01:02:54,471 --> 01:02:58,471
Become sort of a fact
and then turn into a...

897
01:03:00,871 --> 01:03:02,271
A what?

898
01:03:02,271 --> 01:03:05,371
- An inevitability?
- Exactly!

899
01:03:05,571 --> 01:03:07,471
An inevitability.

900
01:03:08,171 --> 01:03:10,771
Take over a few courses
from the older men.

901
01:03:13,471 --> 01:03:15,471
Plow a few pertinent wives.

902
01:03:15,871 --> 01:03:16,771
Now that's it!

903
01:03:17,971 --> 01:03:20,171
You can shove aside
all the older men...

904
01:03:20,471 --> 01:03:23,671
...but until you're plowing pertinent
wives you're not working.

905
01:03:23,971 --> 01:03:25,971
That's the way to power. Plow 'em all!

906
01:03:29,171 --> 01:03:30,471
The way to a man's heart...

907
01:03:30,871 --> 01:03:34,771
...the wide, inviting avenue to his job
is through his wife...

908
01:03:34,971 --> 01:03:36,371
...and don't you forget it.

909
01:03:36,171 --> 01:03:40,871
I bet your wife's got the most inviting
avenue on the whole campus!

910
01:03:44,871 --> 01:03:47,271
I mean, her father
being president and all.

911
01:03:48,371 --> 01:03:50,871
You bet your historical inevitability.

912
01:03:51,671 --> 01:03:54,671
I just better get her off
into the bushes right away.

913
01:03:54,871 --> 01:03:56,371
You'd certainly better.

914
01:03:59,371 --> 01:04:00,971
I almost think you're serious.

915
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:04,971
No, you almost think you're serious.
And it scares you.

916
01:04:05,371 --> 01:04:06,171
Me?

917
01:04:06,771 --> 01:04:07,571
Yes, you.

918
01:04:07,771 --> 01:04:08,871
You're kidding!

919
01:04:09,271 --> 01:04:12,871
I wish I were. I'll give you some
good advice if you want me to.

920
01:04:13,271 --> 01:04:14,671
Good advice? From you?

921
01:04:15,771 --> 01:04:19,671
You haven't learned yet. Take it
wherever you can get it. Listen.

922
01:04:21,071 --> 01:04:23,071
I'm giving you good advice now.

923
01:04:24,771 --> 01:04:28,171
There's quicksand here and you'll be
dragged down before you know it.

924
01:04:28,471 --> 01:04:29,671
Sucked down!

925
01:04:30,971 --> 01:04:34,271
You disgust me on principle and you're
a smug son of a bitch...

926
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:38,371
...but I'm trying to give you
a survival kit. Do you hear me?

927
01:04:38,571 --> 01:04:40,371
I hear you. You come in loud.

928
01:04:40,771 --> 01:04:42,571
You want to play it by ear, right?

929
01:04:42,971 --> 01:04:46,571
Everything will work out anyway,
because the timetable's history, right?

930
01:04:46,971 --> 01:04:49,871
Right. Just tend to your knitting,
grandma. I'll be okay.

931
01:04:50,271 --> 01:04:51,571
I've tried to...

932
01:04:52,571 --> 01:04:54,071
...tried to reach you, to...

933
01:04:54,471 --> 01:04:55,371
Make contact?

934
01:04:56,571 --> 01:04:57,571
Communicate?

935
01:04:57,971 --> 01:04:58,871
Yes, exactly.

936
01:04:59,271 --> 01:05:03,771
Aw, that's touching. That's downright
moving, that's what that is.

937
01:05:04,171 --> 01:05:05,271
Up yours!

938
01:05:05,471 --> 01:05:08,271
- What?
- You heard me.

939
01:05:15,971 --> 01:05:18,271
You take the trouble
to construct a civilization...

940
01:05:18,571 --> 01:05:23,271
...to build a society based on
the principles of... principle.

941
01:05:24,271 --> 01:05:28,071
You make government and art and realize
they are, must be, the same.

942
01:05:28,471 --> 01:05:32,971
You bring things to the saddest point,
where there is something to lose.

943
01:05:33,571 --> 01:05:35,971
Then, all at once,
through all the music...

944
01:05:36,371 --> 01:05:38,571
...through the sensible sounds
of building...

945
01:05:38,971 --> 01:05:41,171
...attempting, comes the Dies Irae.

946
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:44,171
And what is it?
What does the trumpet sound?

947
01:05:44,771 --> 01:05:46,171
Up yours!

948
01:05:52,371 --> 01:05:55,971
Here we are.
A little shaky, but on our feet.

949
01:05:56,171 --> 01:05:58,171
It wasn't too bad, dear, really.

950
01:05:58,471 --> 01:06:01,171
- I'm not cold.
- Just put it on, we're leaving.

951
01:06:01,371 --> 01:06:03,271
- You're what?
- We're going home.

952
01:06:03,671 --> 01:06:06,171
What's been going on here?

953
01:06:06,371 --> 01:06:08,371
- What have you been up to?
- I'll get the car.

954
01:06:08,571 --> 01:06:09,771
I'll call a cab.

955
01:06:11,471 --> 01:06:13,671
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

956
01:06:13,871 --> 01:06:16,371
Now let me see.
I think what I'm doing is...

957
01:06:16,671 --> 01:06:20,871
...I'm getting the car to take
our little guests home.

958
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:33,171
Aren't you going to apologize?

959
01:06:33,571 --> 01:06:34,971
The road should've been straight.

960
01:06:35,371 --> 01:06:37,371
Not that. For making her throw up.

961
01:06:37,671 --> 01:06:40,171
- I did not make her throw up.
- You certainly did.

962
01:06:41,071 --> 01:06:44,371
Who do you think did, sexy there?
He made his own wife sick?

963
01:06:44,671 --> 01:06:46,971
- You make me sick.
- That's different.

964
01:06:47,271 --> 01:06:49,171
Please! I throw up.

965
01:06:49,571 --> 01:06:52,371
I get sick occasionally all by myself,
without reason.

966
01:06:52,571 --> 01:06:54,171
- Is that a fact?
- You're delicate, honey.

967
01:06:55,271 --> 01:06:56,671
I've always done it.

968
01:06:56,871 --> 01:06:58,171
Like Big Ben?

969
01:06:58,371 --> 01:06:59,571
Watch it.

970
01:06:59,871 --> 01:07:02,971
George makes everybody sick.
When our son was a little boy...

971
01:07:03,571 --> 01:07:06,071
...he threw up all the time
because of George.

972
01:07:06,371 --> 01:07:11,071
It got so whenever George came into
a room, he'd start right in retching.

973
01:07:11,271 --> 01:07:14,071
Our son used to throw up all the time...

974
01:07:14,471 --> 01:07:16,171
...because you were always
fiddling at him.

975
01:07:16,571 --> 01:07:19,171
Into his bedroom,
kimono flying, fiddling...

976
01:07:19,571 --> 01:07:22,571
I suppose that's why he ran away
twice in one month.

977
01:07:22,871 --> 01:07:25,771
Twice in one month!
Six times in one year...

978
01:07:26,071 --> 01:07:29,571
Our son ran away from home
because Martha used to corner him.

979
01:07:29,871 --> 01:07:33,071
I never cornered
the son of a bitch in my life!

980
01:07:33,471 --> 01:07:37,371
He'd run to me when I got home
and say, "Mama's always coming at me."

981
01:07:37,771 --> 01:07:38,871
Liar!

982
01:07:39,871 --> 01:07:41,971
Always coming at him.
Very embarrassing!

983
01:07:42,471 --> 01:07:45,071
If it was so embarrassing,
why are you talking about it?

984
01:07:45,871 --> 01:07:47,571
I didn't want to talk about it at all.

985
01:07:48,271 --> 01:07:51,771
I wish I had some brandy.
I love brandy, I really do.

986
01:07:52,571 --> 01:07:54,671
- Good for you.
- It steadies me.

987
01:07:54,871 --> 01:07:56,571
I used to drink brandy.

988
01:07:57,271 --> 01:07:58,971
You used to drink bergin, too.

989
01:07:59,271 --> 01:08:00,271
Shut up, Martha!

990
01:08:03,171 --> 01:08:04,971
- What?
- Nothing.

991
01:08:06,671 --> 01:08:10,571
Did he tell you about that?
Come on, he must have said something.

992
01:08:10,971 --> 01:08:14,471
Actually what we did is
we sort of danced around a little.

993
01:08:15,071 --> 01:08:17,071
I love dancing. I really do.

994
01:08:17,271 --> 01:08:18,071
He didn't mean that.

995
01:08:18,471 --> 01:08:22,271
Well, I didn't think that he did!
Two grown men dancing!

996
01:08:23,971 --> 01:08:27,671
He didn't tell how he tried to publish
a book and Daddy wouldn't let him?

997
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:30,671
- A book? What book?
- Just a book.

998
01:08:30,871 --> 01:08:32,271
Just a book!

999
01:08:32,671 --> 01:08:34,071
Oh, look, dancing!

1000
01:08:34,571 --> 01:08:37,471
Why don't we dance?
I'd love some dancing.

1001
01:08:37,771 --> 01:08:39,771
- We're almost home.
- I want some dancing!

1002
01:08:39,971 --> 01:08:42,771
- That's not such a bad idea.
- Don't you love dancing?

1003
01:08:43,171 --> 01:08:46,271
- With the right man, yeah.
- I dance like the wind.

1004
01:08:47,671 --> 01:08:50,271
Stop the car. We're going dancing!

1005
01:08:50,471 --> 01:08:52,271
- For heaven's sake!
- Did you hear me?

1006
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:55,271
Whatever love wants.

1007
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,871
I dance like the wind!

1008
01:09:05,371 --> 01:09:06,971
Put one on, will you?

1009
01:09:07,871 --> 01:09:10,471
How are we going to work this,
mixed doubles?

1010
01:09:10,971 --> 01:09:12,971
You don't think I'm going
to dance with you?

1011
01:09:13,371 --> 01:09:15,971
Not with him around.
And not with twinkle-toes either.

1012
01:09:16,371 --> 01:09:20,071
I'll dance with anyone!
I'll dance with myself!

1013
01:09:20,871 --> 01:09:24,671
- Honey, you'll get sick again.
- I dance like the wind!

1014
01:09:29,571 --> 01:09:31,871
All right, kiddies, choose up
and hit the sack.

1015
01:09:32,971 --> 01:09:35,671
All right, George, cut that out!

1016
01:09:41,071 --> 01:09:42,371
Cut it out, George!

1017
01:09:43,071 --> 01:09:43,871
What, Martha?

1018
01:09:45,171 --> 01:09:47,371
All right, you son of a bitch!

1019
01:09:47,571 --> 01:09:49,371
- What'd you say, love?
- It stopped!

1020
01:09:49,571 --> 01:09:50,971
Why did it stop?

1021
01:09:53,071 --> 01:09:55,571
I said give me some change.

1022
01:09:57,871 --> 01:09:58,771
Stop that!

1023
01:09:59,471 --> 01:10:02,371
You are always at me
when I'm having a good time!

1024
01:10:02,571 --> 01:10:06,871
Just leave me alone. I like to dance
and you don't want me to.

1025
01:10:07,071 --> 01:10:09,271
Just leave me alone!

1026
01:10:14,071 --> 01:10:15,771
Choose it. Do your stuff.

1027
01:10:16,471 --> 01:10:17,771
You're damned right.

1028
01:10:18,071 --> 01:10:19,571
Hi, sexy!

1029
01:10:19,771 --> 01:10:21,671
You want to dance, angel boobs?

1030
01:10:22,871 --> 01:10:24,371
What'd you call my wife?

1031
01:10:25,771 --> 01:10:29,671
No, if I can't do my interpretive dance,
I don't want to dance at all.

1032
01:10:30,071 --> 01:10:31,571
I'll just sit here.

1033
01:10:32,071 --> 01:10:33,771
Okay, stuff, let's go.

1034
01:10:38,271 --> 01:10:40,771
- We'll just sit here and watch.
- That's right.

1035
01:10:53,571 --> 01:10:55,771
You are strong, aren't you?

1036
01:10:56,271 --> 01:10:57,571
I like that.

1037
01:10:58,771 --> 01:11:00,671
They dance like they've danced before.

1038
01:11:00,871 --> 01:11:03,871
A familiar dance, monkey nipples,
they know it.

1039
01:11:04,271 --> 01:11:05,771
I don't know what you mean.

1040
01:11:08,771 --> 01:11:11,471
- I like the way you move.
- I like the way you move too.

1041
01:11:11,671 --> 01:11:13,871
- They like the way they move.
- That's nice.

1042
01:11:15,971 --> 01:11:19,871
I'm surprised George didn't tell you
his side of things.

1043
01:11:20,271 --> 01:11:22,471
- Well, he didn't.
- That surprises me.

1044
01:11:22,671 --> 01:11:24,471
- Does it?
- Aren't they cute?

1045
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:26,271
He usually does when he can.

1046
01:11:26,471 --> 01:11:28,071
I don't think he trusts me.

1047
01:11:28,271 --> 01:11:32,671
It's really a very sad story.

1048
01:11:33,671 --> 01:11:36,471
It would make you weep.

1049
01:11:36,771 --> 01:11:38,871
You have ugly talents, Martha.

1050
01:11:39,071 --> 01:11:40,571
Is that so?

1051
01:11:41,771 --> 01:11:42,771
Don't encourage her.

1052
01:11:43,271 --> 01:11:44,471
Encourage me.

1053
01:11:44,971 --> 01:11:46,371
I warned you, don't encourage her!

1054
01:11:46,571 --> 01:11:47,871
He warned you.

1055
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:52,171
- Don't encourage me.
- I heard him. Tell me more.

1056
01:11:57,071 --> 01:11:59,871
Georgie-boy had lots of big ambitions...

1057
01:12:00,171 --> 01:12:02,771
...in spite of something funny
in his past...

1058
01:12:02,971 --> 01:12:05,971
...which Georgie-boy here
turned into a novel.

1059
01:12:06,171 --> 01:12:09,771
His first attempt and also his last!

1060
01:12:11,171 --> 01:12:12,771
I rhymed!

1061
01:12:14,771 --> 01:12:15,971
I warn you!

1062
01:12:16,671 --> 01:12:20,671
But Daddy took a look
at Georgie's novel.

1063
01:12:20,871 --> 01:12:22,871
You're looking for a punch in the mouth.

1064
01:12:23,071 --> 01:12:24,171
Do tell!

1065
01:12:24,671 --> 01:12:27,071
And he was very shocked by what he read.

1066
01:12:27,271 --> 01:12:29,171
- He was?
- Yes, he was.

1067
01:12:29,571 --> 01:12:32,471
A novel all about a naughty boy-child.

1068
01:12:32,771 --> 01:12:33,971
I will not tolerate this!

1069
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:35,371
Oh, can it!

1070
01:12:35,871 --> 01:12:38,371
A naughty boy-child...

1071
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:42,171
...who killed his mother...

1072
01:12:42,571 --> 01:12:44,671
...and his father dead!

1073
01:12:45,871 --> 01:12:46,871
Stop it!

1074
01:12:49,371 --> 01:12:51,171
And Daddy said, "Look here...

1075
01:12:51,371 --> 01:12:54,971
"...I will not let you
publish such a thing!"

1076
01:12:55,271 --> 01:12:56,571
The dancing's over!

1077
01:12:56,871 --> 01:12:58,271
Violence!

1078
01:12:58,771 --> 01:12:59,671
And Daddy said...

1079
01:13:00,071 --> 01:13:04,571
..."You don't think I'm going to
let you publish this kind of crap?"

1080
01:13:04,871 --> 01:13:07,571
"Not on your life,
not while you're teaching here."

1081
01:13:07,871 --> 01:13:11,371
"You publish that
and you're out on your ass!"

1082
01:13:11,771 --> 01:13:13,371
Desist! Desist!

1083
01:13:14,571 --> 01:13:16,071
I will not be made mock of.

1084
01:13:16,371 --> 01:13:19,371
He will not be made mock of,
for cripes sake!

1085
01:13:19,771 --> 01:13:20,871
The game is over!

1086
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:22,771
Just imagine...

1087
01:13:23,271 --> 01:13:27,171
...a book all about a boy who murders
his mother and kills his father...

1088
01:13:27,771 --> 01:13:30,171
...and pretends it's all an accident.

1089
01:13:30,871 --> 01:13:32,471
Hey, wait a minute!

1090
01:13:32,971 --> 01:13:34,771
You want to know the clincher?

1091
01:13:35,071 --> 01:13:38,071
You want to know what
big brave Georgie said to Daddy?

1092
01:13:41,171 --> 01:13:42,971
But Daddy...

1093
01:13:43,571 --> 01:13:46,971
I mean, "But, Sir, this isn't
a novel at all."

1094
01:13:47,271 --> 01:13:48,271
You will not say this!

1095
01:13:48,571 --> 01:13:49,771
The hell, I won't! Keep away!

1096
01:13:50,071 --> 01:13:52,071
"No, sir, this is no novel at all."

1097
01:13:52,471 --> 01:13:55,671
"This is the truth.
This really happened to me!"

1098
01:13:55,871 --> 01:13:58,271
- I'll kill you.
- It happened!

1099
01:14:01,871 --> 01:14:02,871
Violence!

1100
01:14:13,671 --> 01:14:14,971
Very quiet now.

1101
01:14:15,971 --> 01:14:17,271
We'll all be...

1102
01:14:17,671 --> 01:14:18,971
...very quiet.

1103
01:14:23,271 --> 01:14:24,171
Murderer!

1104
01:14:25,971 --> 01:14:27,471
What's the trouble in here?

1105
01:14:28,171 --> 01:14:30,971
Nothing. No trouble,
just playing a game.

1106
01:14:32,971 --> 01:14:34,371
Well, we're closing.

1107
01:14:34,671 --> 01:14:35,871
One more round.

1108
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:37,271
Same for everybody.

1109
01:14:37,471 --> 01:14:40,171
Give us one more round
and we'll be on our merry way.

1110
01:14:40,371 --> 01:14:42,471
All right? Good!

1111
01:14:42,671 --> 01:14:43,671
Thanks.

1112
01:14:49,171 --> 01:14:51,371
Well, that's one game.
What shall we do now?

1113
01:14:53,671 --> 01:14:58,171
Let's do something else. We played
Humiliate the Host, what'll we do now?

1114
01:14:59,471 --> 01:15:00,971
Oh, look!

1115
01:15:01,871 --> 01:15:03,871
We must know other games,
us college types.

1116
01:15:04,071 --> 01:15:06,971
- Can't be the limit of our vocabulary.
- Haven't had enough?

1117
01:15:07,171 --> 01:15:08,571
There are other games.

1118
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:10,371
How about...

1119
01:15:10,871 --> 01:15:13,671
How about Hump the Hostess?

1120
01:15:14,171 --> 01:15:17,571
Want to play that one? Do you want
to play Hump the Hostess?

1121
01:15:18,871 --> 01:15:20,671
Or do you want to wait till later,
off in the bushes?

1122
01:15:20,971 --> 01:15:21,971
Hump the Hostess!

1123
01:15:22,171 --> 01:15:23,171
Will you shut up?

1124
01:15:39,871 --> 01:15:43,271
You want to save that for later.
What shall we play now?

1125
01:15:43,571 --> 01:15:46,771
- Portrait of a Man Drowning.
- I'm not drowning.

1126
01:15:47,271 --> 01:15:49,671
- You told me to shut up.
- I'm sorry.

1127
01:15:49,871 --> 01:15:50,671
I'm sorry!

1128
01:15:52,471 --> 01:15:53,771
I know what we do.

1129
01:15:53,871 --> 01:15:57,071
Now that we've done this round
of Humiliate the Host...

1130
01:15:57,371 --> 01:15:59,571
...and don't want to play
Hump the Hostess yet.

1131
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:03,071
I know what! How about a little round
of Get the Guests?

1132
01:16:03,371 --> 01:16:05,571
How about that? Get the Guests?

1133
01:16:06,571 --> 01:16:08,271
Book dropper, child mentioner!

1134
01:16:08,571 --> 01:16:09,371
I don't like these games.

1135
01:16:09,771 --> 01:16:13,971
We've only had one game, we've got to
have another. You can't fly on one.

1136
01:16:14,271 --> 01:16:15,171
Silence!

1137
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:17,671
How will we play Get the Guests?

1138
01:16:17,971 --> 01:16:18,971
You be quiet!

1139
01:16:19,171 --> 01:16:20,971
I wonder.

1140
01:16:26,471 --> 01:16:30,271
Martha, in her indiscreet way,
told you all about my first novel.

1141
01:16:30,471 --> 01:16:32,571
True or false that there
was such a thing.

1142
01:16:32,971 --> 01:16:35,971
She told you about my first novel,
my memory book.

1143
01:16:36,071 --> 01:16:38,571
I preferred she hadn't, but
that's blood under the bridge.

1144
01:16:38,971 --> 01:16:41,471
But what Martha didn't tell you...

1145
01:16:41,771 --> 01:16:44,771
...what Martha didn't tell at all about
was my second novel.

1146
01:16:45,071 --> 01:16:48,271
You didn't know about that, did you?
True or false?

1147
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:52,671
Well, it's an allegory really, probably.

1148
01:16:52,971 --> 01:16:56,271
It's about a nice young couple
who comes out of the Middle West.

1149
01:16:56,771 --> 01:16:58,171
It's a bucolic, you see.

1150
01:16:58,471 --> 01:17:01,171
This nice young couple
comes out of the Middle West.

1151
01:17:01,371 --> 01:17:03,271
He's blond and he's about thirty.

1152
01:17:03,671 --> 01:17:07,171
And he's a scientist,
a teacher, a scientist.

1153
01:17:07,471 --> 01:17:11,571
- His mouse, wifey, gargles brandy...
- Just a minute here!

1154
01:17:11,771 --> 01:17:14,071
This is my game!
You've had your game!

1155
01:17:14,271 --> 01:17:15,971
I want to hear. I love stories.

1156
01:17:16,171 --> 01:17:18,171
Mousie's father was a holy man, see?

1157
01:17:18,471 --> 01:17:22,471
He ran a traveling clip joint and he
took the faithful, just took them.

1158
01:17:22,871 --> 01:17:25,171
- This is familiar.
- No kidding.

1159
01:17:25,371 --> 01:17:28,971
Anyway, Blondie and his frau
out of the Plains States came.

1160
01:17:29,671 --> 01:17:31,371
Very funny, George.

1161
01:17:31,871 --> 01:17:32,671
Thank you.

1162
01:17:32,871 --> 01:17:35,171
They settled in a town
like Nouveau Carthage.

1163
01:17:35,371 --> 01:17:37,171
- I don't think you should go on.
- Do you not?

1164
01:17:37,371 --> 01:17:39,171
I love familiar stories.
They're the best.

1165
01:17:39,471 --> 01:17:42,871
How right you are! But Blondie
was all in disguise as a teacher...

1166
01:17:43,171 --> 01:17:47,471
...because his baggage ticket had
bigger things writ on it. H.I.!

1167
01:17:47,971 --> 01:17:49,471
Historical Inevitability.

1168
01:17:49,871 --> 01:17:52,471
- There's no reason to go further.
- Let them go on.

1169
01:17:53,171 --> 01:17:57,171
He had this baggage, and part of his
baggage was in the form of his mouse.

1170
01:17:57,571 --> 01:17:58,771
We don't have to listen.

1171
01:17:59,071 --> 01:18:00,571
- Why not?
- She has a point.

1172
01:18:00,771 --> 01:18:03,571
Nobody could figure out
Blondie's baggage, his mouse.

1173
01:18:03,871 --> 01:18:07,571
I mean, here he was pan-Kansas
swimming champion or something...

1174
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:09,071
...and he had this mouse.

1175
01:18:09,371 --> 01:18:13,071
Of whom he was solicitous to a point
that faileth human understanding...

1176
01:18:13,371 --> 01:18:15,571
...given that she was
something of a simp.

1177
01:18:15,871 --> 01:18:17,171
This just isn't fair of you.

1178
01:18:17,571 --> 01:18:20,471
Perhaps not. His mouse
tooted brandy immodestly...

1179
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:23,171
...and spent half her time
in the upchuck.

1180
01:18:23,371 --> 01:18:24,871
- I know these people.
- Do you?

1181
01:18:25,071 --> 01:18:27,371
But she was money baggage
among other things.

1182
01:18:27,771 --> 01:18:32,371
Godly money from the golden teeth of the
unfaithful and she was put up with!

1183
01:18:32,571 --> 01:18:35,671
- I don't like this story.
- And she was put up with!

1184
01:18:35,871 --> 01:18:36,871
Stop? Hah!

1185
01:18:37,071 --> 01:18:39,571
- Please, please, don't.
- Beg, baby!

1186
01:18:40,571 --> 01:18:43,571
- Flashback to "How they got married."
- No!

1187
01:18:44,071 --> 01:18:46,371
- Why?
- How they got married was this.

1188
01:18:46,871 --> 01:18:49,071
The mouse got all puffed up one day...

1189
01:18:49,871 --> 01:18:53,771
...and she went over to Blondie's house
and stuck out her puff...

1190
01:18:54,071 --> 01:18:55,371
...and she said, "Look at me."

1191
01:18:55,771 --> 01:18:56,771
I don't like this.

1192
01:18:57,071 --> 01:19:01,471
"Look at me, I'm all puffed up."
"Oh, my goodness," said Blondie.

1193
01:19:01,771 --> 01:19:03,571
And so they were married.

1194
01:19:05,371 --> 01:19:06,471
And then what?

1195
01:19:06,771 --> 01:19:10,471
And then the puff went away again
like magic. Poof!

1196
01:19:13,271 --> 01:19:14,471
The puff went away?

1197
01:19:16,971 --> 01:19:20,471
Honey, I didn't mean to. Honestly.

1198
01:19:23,971 --> 01:19:26,371
You shouldn't have told them!

1199
01:19:26,571 --> 01:19:29,571
No! You couldn't have told them!

1200
01:19:30,671 --> 01:19:32,871
And that's how you play Get the Guests.

1201
01:19:34,171 --> 01:19:36,471
Oh, please! I'm going to be sick!

1202
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:45,771
You shouldn't have done that.

1203
01:19:46,371 --> 01:19:48,671
- I hate hypocrisy.
- That was cruel and vicious.

1204
01:19:48,871 --> 01:19:50,771
She'll get over it. She'll recover.

1205
01:19:50,971 --> 01:19:52,571
- And damaging to me.
- To you!

1206
01:19:52,771 --> 01:19:53,571
To me!

1207
01:19:56,471 --> 01:20:01,071
Beautiful. You got to have a swine
to show you where the truffles are.

1208
01:20:01,771 --> 01:20:04,871
Rearrange your alliances.
Make the best of things.

1209
01:20:05,171 --> 01:20:06,671
Put your wife in the car.

1210
01:20:06,971 --> 01:20:09,371
I've had enough rides tonight.
We'll walk.

1211
01:20:09,671 --> 01:20:11,671
Right, you go plan some new strategy.

1212
01:20:13,871 --> 01:20:14,971
You'll regret this.

1213
01:20:15,171 --> 01:20:16,771
No doubt. I regret everything.

1214
01:20:17,171 --> 01:20:19,171
No, I mean I'll make you regret this.

1215
01:20:19,371 --> 01:20:20,171
Clean up the mess.

1216
01:20:20,671 --> 01:20:21,671
You just wait.

1217
01:20:23,371 --> 01:20:25,171
- Very good, George.
- Thank you.

1218
01:20:25,371 --> 01:20:27,671
- Really good!
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.

1219
01:20:27,871 --> 01:20:32,471
I mean, you did a good job.
You really fixed it.

1220
01:20:34,071 --> 01:20:36,571
That's the most life you've shown
in a long time.

1221
01:20:36,871 --> 01:20:38,271
You bring out the best in me.

1222
01:20:42,271 --> 01:20:44,071
You really are a bastard!

1223
01:20:44,371 --> 01:20:46,871
You can go around like
a hopped-up Arab...

1224
01:20:47,771 --> 01:20:50,871
...slashing at everything,
scarring up half the world...

1225
01:20:51,171 --> 01:20:53,871
...but let somebody else try it?
Oh no!

1226
01:20:54,071 --> 01:20:58,271
Why, baby, I did it all for you!
I thought you'd like it, sweetheart.

1227
01:20:59,071 --> 01:21:01,571
It's to your taste,
blood, carnage and all.

1228
01:21:02,171 --> 01:21:04,271
I thought you'd sort of get excited.

1229
01:21:04,571 --> 01:21:07,971
Heave and pant and come running at me,
your melons bobbling...

1230
01:21:08,271 --> 01:21:10,571
You have really screwed up, George.

1231
01:21:11,271 --> 01:21:12,971
I mean it! You really have!

1232
01:21:14,271 --> 01:21:15,971
You can sit,
gin running from your mouth...

1233
01:21:16,271 --> 01:21:20,271
...you can humiliate me, tear me to
pieces all night, it's perfectly okay.

1234
01:21:20,571 --> 01:21:21,771
You can stand it!

1235
01:21:22,071 --> 01:21:23,071
I cannot stand it!

1236
01:21:23,471 --> 01:21:26,271
You can stand it!
You married me for it!

1237
01:21:29,271 --> 01:21:31,071
That's a desperately sick lie.

1238
01:21:31,471 --> 01:21:33,471
Don't you know it even yet?

1239
01:21:36,771 --> 01:21:39,171
My arm's gotten tired whipping you.

1240
01:21:40,171 --> 01:21:42,671
- Year after year!
- Deluded, Martha.

1241
01:21:42,971 --> 01:21:43,971
It's not what I wanted.

1242
01:21:44,271 --> 01:21:46,971
I thought at least you were onto
yourself. I didn't know.

1243
01:21:47,671 --> 01:21:48,971
No. You're sick!

1244
01:21:50,771 --> 01:21:53,471
I'll show you who's sick!

1245
01:22:08,671 --> 01:22:11,971
You really are having
a field day, aren't you?

1246
01:22:13,671 --> 01:22:16,971
Well, I'm gonna finish you
before I'm through with you.

1247
01:22:17,471 --> 01:22:20,471
You and that quarterback?
You both going to finish me?

1248
01:22:20,671 --> 01:22:24,971
Before I'm through with you you'll
wish you'd died in that automobile!

1249
01:22:25,371 --> 01:22:27,671
You'll wish you'd never mentioned
our son.

1250
01:22:27,971 --> 01:22:28,771
I warned you.

1251
01:22:28,971 --> 01:22:31,371
- I'm impressed!
- I warned you not to go too far!

1252
01:22:31,571 --> 01:22:33,771
I'm just beginning!

1253
01:22:34,371 --> 01:22:37,471
I'm numbed so I can take you
when we're alone. I don't listen.

1254
01:22:38,171 --> 01:22:42,671
And if I do listen I sift it so I don't
really hear, which is the only way.

1255
01:22:43,971 --> 01:22:46,571
But you've taken a new tack
in the last century...

1256
01:22:46,871 --> 01:22:50,171
...which is just too much. Too much!

1257
01:22:52,071 --> 01:22:56,171
I don't mind your dirty underthings in
public. I do, but I'm reconciled to it.

1258
01:22:56,671 --> 01:22:59,871
You've moved into your own
fantasy world! You don't know...

1259
01:23:00,671 --> 01:23:02,071
- You have!
- Nuts!

1260
01:23:02,371 --> 01:23:03,571
You can go on...

1261
01:23:03,871 --> 01:23:08,171
Have you ever listened to your
sentences? You're so convoluted.

1262
01:23:08,871 --> 01:23:11,171
You talk like one of your stupid papers.

1263
01:23:11,571 --> 01:23:14,671
Actually, I'm rather worried about you.
About your mind.

1264
01:23:15,071 --> 01:23:17,571
Don't you worry
about my mind, sweetheart!

1265
01:23:17,871 --> 01:23:18,871
I'll commit you.

1266
01:23:19,371 --> 01:23:20,371
You what?

1267
01:23:20,771 --> 01:23:22,771
I think I'll have you committed.

1268
01:23:26,571 --> 01:23:28,771
Baby, aren't you something?

1269
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:31,271
I've got to find a way to get at you.

1270
01:23:31,571 --> 01:23:35,071
You've got at me, you don't have to
do anything, George.

1271
01:23:35,771 --> 01:23:38,071
A thousand years of you
has been enough!

1272
01:23:38,371 --> 01:23:39,371
You'll go quietly then?

1273
01:23:40,871 --> 01:23:44,371
Do you want to know what's
really happened?

1274
01:23:45,271 --> 01:23:49,271
It snapped! Finally. Not me, it!
The whole arrangement.

1275
01:23:49,871 --> 01:23:53,071
You can go on forever and ever,
everything is manageable.

1276
01:23:53,471 --> 01:23:57,271
You make all sorts of excuses:
"To hell with it, this is life."

1277
01:23:57,471 --> 01:23:59,771
"Maybe tomorrow he'll be dead.
Maybe tomorrow you'll be dead."

1278
01:24:00,271 --> 01:24:01,771
All sorts of excuses.

1279
01:24:02,671 --> 01:24:04,371
Then one day...

1280
01:24:04,571 --> 01:24:07,171
...one night, something happens...

1281
01:24:07,871 --> 01:24:08,871
...and snap!

1282
01:24:09,071 --> 01:24:12,471
It breaks and you just don't
give a damn anymore!

1283
01:24:14,471 --> 01:24:17,471
I tried with you, baby. I really tried.

1284
01:24:18,271 --> 01:24:19,471
Come off it.

1285
01:24:23,271 --> 01:24:25,071
You're a monster. You are.

1286
01:24:26,471 --> 01:24:28,271
I'm loud, and I'm vulgar...

1287
01:24:28,671 --> 01:24:31,771
...and I wear the pants in the house
because somebody's got to!

1288
01:24:32,871 --> 01:24:34,771
But I am not a monster!

1289
01:24:35,771 --> 01:24:36,771
I'm not!

1290
01:24:37,171 --> 01:24:41,071
You're a spoiled, self-indulgent,
dirty-minded, liquor-riddled...

1291
01:24:41,371 --> 01:24:43,471
Snap! It went snap.

1292
01:24:44,171 --> 01:24:46,671
I won't try to get through
to you any more.

1293
01:24:47,771 --> 01:24:50,771
There was a second back there,
when I could've...

1294
01:24:50,971 --> 01:24:52,471
...gotten through to you.

1295
01:24:53,071 --> 01:24:56,471
When maybe we could've out
through all this crap!

1296
01:24:57,671 --> 01:25:01,371
But it's past.
And I'm not going to try.

1297
01:25:01,671 --> 01:25:04,471
Once a month, Martha.
I've gotten used to it.

1298
01:25:05,071 --> 01:25:09,771
We get Misunderstood Martha, the
good-hearted girl beneath the barnacles.

1299
01:25:09,971 --> 01:25:13,371
The little miss that a touch of kindness
will bring to bloom again.

1300
01:25:14,471 --> 01:25:18,171
I believed it more times than I'd admit.
I'm that much of a sucker.

1301
01:25:18,871 --> 01:25:21,471
But I don't believe you,
I just don't believe you!

1302
01:25:21,871 --> 01:25:25,671
There is no moment any more
when we could come together.

1303
01:25:25,971 --> 01:25:29,671
You can't come together with nothing.
And you're nothing!

1304
01:25:30,171 --> 01:25:31,171
Snap!

1305
01:25:32,871 --> 01:25:35,571
I looked at you tonight
and you weren't there!

1306
01:25:37,071 --> 01:25:41,371
It finally snapped.
And I'm gonna howl it out!

1307
01:25:41,871 --> 01:25:43,371
I won't give a damn what I do.

1308
01:25:43,671 --> 01:25:47,171
And I'll make the biggest goddamn
explosion you've ever heard!

1309
01:25:47,871 --> 01:25:49,671
And I'll beat you at your own game.

1310
01:25:50,071 --> 01:25:52,871
- Is that a threat, George?
- That's a threat, Martha.

1311
01:25:53,071 --> 01:25:54,371
You're going to get it, baby!

1312
01:25:54,671 --> 01:25:56,871
Be careful, I'll rip you to pieces.

1313
01:25:57,271 --> 01:26:00,371
You are not man enough.
You haven't the guts!

1314
01:26:01,871 --> 01:26:02,871
Total war?

1315
01:26:03,671 --> 01:26:04,971
Total!

1316
01:30:15,871 --> 01:30:16,771
Bells.

1317
01:30:21,271 --> 01:30:23,771
I've been hearing bells!

1318
01:30:25,271 --> 01:30:26,571
Bells ringing.

1319
01:30:37,371 --> 01:30:39,571
And I couldn't sleep for the bells.

1320
01:30:43,471 --> 01:30:45,171
That woke me up.

1321
01:30:45,571 --> 01:30:46,771
What time is it?

1322
01:30:47,471 --> 01:30:48,971
Don't bother me.

1323
01:30:52,771 --> 01:30:54,071
I was asleep.

1324
01:30:55,271 --> 01:30:57,971
And I was dreaming of something...

1325
01:30:58,571 --> 01:30:59,771
...and I heard the sounds coming...

1326
01:30:59,971 --> 01:31:02,371
...and I didn't know what it was...

1327
01:31:03,771 --> 01:31:05,271
...and it frightened me.

1328
01:31:05,971 --> 01:31:07,771
I'm going to get you, Martha.

1329
01:31:09,771 --> 01:31:11,271
Somehow, Martha.

1330
01:31:12,471 --> 01:31:16,571
And there was someone there and...
I didn't want someone there.

1331
01:31:17,071 --> 01:31:18,771
I was naked.

1332
01:31:19,071 --> 01:31:20,971
You don't know what's going on, do you?

1333
01:31:21,971 --> 01:31:23,671
I don't want to know.

1334
01:31:24,771 --> 01:31:26,171
Listen to them!

1335
01:31:26,671 --> 01:31:28,471
- I don't want to!
- Look at them!

1336
01:31:33,171 --> 01:31:34,771
I don't want any children.

1337
01:31:35,771 --> 01:31:37,971
I don't want any children, please!

1338
01:31:38,971 --> 01:31:42,471
I'm afraid. I don't want to be hurt.

1339
01:31:44,971 --> 01:31:46,671
I should have known.

1340
01:31:47,771 --> 01:31:50,271
Does that stud you married
know about that?

1341
01:31:51,271 --> 01:31:54,471
How do you make your
secret little murders? Pills?

1342
01:31:54,771 --> 01:31:57,871
You got a secret supply of pills?
Apple jelly? Willpower?

1343
01:31:58,171 --> 01:31:59,071
Going to throw up?

1344
01:31:59,271 --> 01:32:01,371
Where is he? I want my husband!
I want a drink!

1345
01:32:01,571 --> 01:32:03,671
That's right, go at it!

1346
01:32:04,471 --> 01:32:06,671
You know what's going on there?

1347
01:32:08,671 --> 01:32:12,671
I don't want to know anything.
You leave me alone.

1348
01:32:14,671 --> 01:32:15,571
Who rang?

1349
01:32:16,471 --> 01:32:17,971
What were the bells? Who rang?

1350
01:32:18,371 --> 01:32:20,171
He's up there and you ask who rang?

1351
01:32:20,371 --> 01:32:21,771
Someone rang!

1352
01:32:26,071 --> 01:32:27,471
Someone rang.

1353
01:32:30,571 --> 01:32:32,571
The bells rang and it was someone...

1354
01:32:32,771 --> 01:32:33,871
Somebody.

1355
01:32:35,371 --> 01:32:38,171
Somebody rang.
The bells rang and it was somebody...

1356
01:32:43,371 --> 01:32:44,371
I've got it!

1357
01:32:45,471 --> 01:32:47,071
I've got it, Martha!

1358
01:32:47,671 --> 01:32:50,171
It was a message. The message was...

1359
01:32:50,371 --> 01:32:53,671
...our son... it was a message...
The bells rang...

1360
01:32:53,971 --> 01:32:56,071
...and it was a message.
And it was about...

1361
01:32:56,671 --> 01:32:58,171
...our son...

1362
01:32:58,371 --> 01:33:00,071
And the message was...

1363
01:33:02,771 --> 01:33:04,371
...our son...

1364
01:33:04,671 --> 01:33:06,871
...is dead!

1365
01:33:07,071 --> 01:33:09,971
Our son is dead
and I haven't told Martha!

1366
01:33:10,271 --> 01:33:13,371
Our son is dead, Martha doesn't know,
and you won't tell her!

1367
01:33:16,271 --> 01:33:19,571
I'll tell her myself.
In good time I'll tell her myself.

1368
01:33:19,871 --> 01:33:21,271
I'm going to be sick.

1369
01:33:21,871 --> 01:33:23,171
Are you? That's nice.

1370
01:33:23,371 --> 01:33:26,771
- I'm going to die.
- Good, go right ahead.

1371
01:33:35,771 --> 01:33:37,271
Martha, I have some...

1372
01:33:37,971 --> 01:33:39,471
...terrible news.

1373
01:33:41,571 --> 01:33:43,171
It's about our son.

1374
01:33:45,171 --> 01:33:46,271
He's dead.

1375
01:33:48,971 --> 01:33:50,471
Do you hear me, Martha?

1376
01:33:52,571 --> 01:33:54,271
Our boy is dead.

1377
01:34:46,671 --> 01:34:49,171
Where the hell is everybody?

1378
01:35:46,071 --> 01:35:50,371
I'll give you bastards five to come from
wherever you're hiding!

1379
01:37:06,171 --> 01:37:08,471
By God, you've gone crazy too.

1380
01:37:10,771 --> 01:37:13,271
I said you've gone crazy too.

1381
01:37:16,971 --> 01:37:18,271
Probably.

1382
01:37:21,071 --> 01:37:22,371
You've all gone crazy.

1383
01:37:24,071 --> 01:37:25,971
I come downstairs and what happens?

1384
01:37:34,571 --> 01:37:36,071
What happens?

1385
01:37:40,471 --> 01:37:44,271
My wife's in the can with
a liquor bottle and she winks at me.

1386
01:37:45,471 --> 01:37:46,871
Winks at me!

1387
01:37:47,971 --> 01:37:49,871
She's never winked at you?

1388
01:37:50,871 --> 01:37:52,671
What a shame!

1389
01:37:53,671 --> 01:37:57,171
She's lying down on the floor,
on the tiles, all curled-up...

1390
01:37:58,871 --> 01:38:02,271
...and she starts peeling
the label on the brandy bottle.

1391
01:38:02,471 --> 01:38:05,371
Maybe she'd be
more comfortable in the tub.

1392
01:38:08,371 --> 01:38:11,071
And I asked her what she's doing
and she goes...

1393
01:38:11,371 --> 01:38:13,871
..."Sshh, nobody knows I'm here."

1394
01:38:16,571 --> 01:38:18,571
And I come down here...

1395
01:38:18,871 --> 01:38:23,371
...and you're stumbling around going
"clink", for God's sake, "clink".

1396
01:38:26,671 --> 01:38:28,571
You've all gone crazy.

1397
01:38:30,571 --> 01:38:32,071
Sad but true.

1398
01:38:33,571 --> 01:38:35,371
Where is your husband?

1399
01:38:35,771 --> 01:38:38,571
He is vanished.

1400
01:38:44,571 --> 01:38:46,271
You're all crazy.

1401
01:38:47,071 --> 01:38:48,171
Nuts!

1402
01:38:48,871 --> 01:38:52,771
'Tis the refuge we take
when the unreality of the world...

1403
01:38:53,071 --> 01:38:55,371
...sits too heavy on our tiny heads.

1404
01:38:57,571 --> 01:39:01,571
Relax! Sink into it. You're no better
than anybody else.

1405
01:39:03,271 --> 01:39:04,571
I think I am.

1406
01:39:10,371 --> 01:39:13,971
You're certainly a flop
in some departments.

1407
01:39:23,271 --> 01:39:24,471
What'd you say?

1408
01:39:26,471 --> 01:39:28,971
I said you're a flop
in some departments.

1409
01:39:29,271 --> 01:39:30,971
I'm sorry you're disappointed.

1410
01:39:31,571 --> 01:39:34,071
Maybe some time
when I didn't drink for ten hours.

1411
01:39:35,271 --> 01:39:37,971
Baby, you sure are a flop!

1412
01:39:39,071 --> 01:39:42,171
You're something. You know that?
You're really something!

1413
01:39:44,871 --> 01:39:46,771
To you, everybody's a flop!

1414
01:39:47,171 --> 01:39:48,671
Your husband's a flop, I'm a flop.

1415
01:39:48,971 --> 01:39:49,971
You're all flops.

1416
01:39:50,271 --> 01:39:54,171
I am the Earth Mother
and you are all flops.

1417
01:39:59,271 --> 01:40:01,271
I disgust me.

1418
01:40:08,771 --> 01:40:12,271
There's only been one man in my life
who's ever made me happy.

1419
01:40:14,471 --> 01:40:16,371
You know that? One.

1420
01:40:16,971 --> 01:40:18,871
The gym instructor or something?

1421
01:40:22,171 --> 01:40:23,071
George.

1422
01:40:26,171 --> 01:40:27,471
My husband.

1423
01:40:27,971 --> 01:40:29,171
You're kidding?

1424
01:40:30,371 --> 01:40:32,171
You must be. Him?

1425
01:40:35,671 --> 01:40:36,971
You don't believe it.

1426
01:40:37,371 --> 01:40:38,671
Why, of course I do.

1427
01:40:39,171 --> 01:40:40,971
You always deal on appearances?

1428
01:40:41,271 --> 01:40:42,471
For God's sake!

1429
01:40:43,971 --> 01:40:47,671
George who is out
somewhere there in the dark.

1430
01:40:49,071 --> 01:40:51,871
Who is good to me. Whom I revile.

1431
01:40:53,371 --> 01:40:58,071
Who can keep learning the games we play
as quickly as I can change them.

1432
01:40:58,671 --> 01:41:01,871
Who can make me happy
and I do not wish to be happy.

1433
01:41:02,171 --> 01:41:04,871
Yes, I do wish to be happy.

1434
01:41:07,171 --> 01:41:09,171
George and Martha.

1435
01:41:10,171 --> 01:41:12,371
Sad, sad, sad.

1436
01:41:14,871 --> 01:41:17,671
Whom I will not forgive
for having come to rest.

1437
01:41:18,371 --> 01:41:20,671
For having seen me and having said...

1438
01:41:21,671 --> 01:41:24,271
..."Yes, this will do."

1439
01:41:25,371 --> 01:41:28,871
Who has made the hideous, the hurting...

1440
01:41:29,271 --> 01:41:33,771
...the insulting mistake of loving me.

1441
01:41:34,571 --> 01:41:36,371
And must be punished for it.

1442
01:41:42,271 --> 01:41:45,071
Sad, sad, sad.

1443
01:41:48,871 --> 01:41:49,871
Some day...

1444
01:41:52,071 --> 01:41:53,271
...some night...

1445
01:41:53,571 --> 01:41:57,971
...some stupid liquor-ridden night
I will go too far.

1446
01:41:59,271 --> 01:42:03,271
I'll either break his back or I'll
push him off for good, which I deserve.

1447
01:42:04,571 --> 01:42:06,571
I don't think he's got
a vertebrae intact.

1448
01:42:08,071 --> 01:42:10,771
Oh, you don't?

1449
01:42:10,971 --> 01:42:12,671
You don't think so?

1450
01:42:13,571 --> 01:42:15,071
Oh, little boy!

1451
01:42:15,971 --> 01:42:19,471
You've got yourself so hunched over
your microphone...

1452
01:42:19,771 --> 01:42:21,071
Microscope!

1453
01:42:21,471 --> 01:42:23,771
Yes. And you don't
see anything, do you?

1454
01:42:24,071 --> 01:42:26,771
You see everything
but the goddamn mind.

1455
01:42:27,071 --> 01:42:31,471
You see all the specks and the crap,
but you don't see what goes on, do you?

1456
01:42:32,771 --> 01:42:36,771
You know so little. And you're going
to take over the world, huh?

1457
01:42:37,271 --> 01:42:38,771
I said, all right!

1458
01:42:40,771 --> 01:42:42,771
The stallion's mad, huh?

1459
01:42:43,171 --> 01:42:46,471
The gelding's getting all upset, huh?

1460
01:42:46,771 --> 01:42:48,771
You swing wild, don't you?

1461
01:42:49,171 --> 01:42:50,771
You poor little bastard!

1462
01:42:51,171 --> 01:42:52,471
Hit out at everything!

1463
01:42:53,171 --> 01:42:54,471
Go answer the door.

1464
01:42:56,171 --> 01:42:57,271
What'd you say to me?

1465
01:42:57,671 --> 01:43:00,171
I said go answer the door.
What are you, deaf?

1466
01:43:00,471 --> 01:43:02,671
You want me to go answer the door?

1467
01:43:02,971 --> 01:43:05,471
That's right, lunkhead,
go answer the door.

1468
01:43:05,971 --> 01:43:08,471
Or are you too drunk to do that, too?

1469
01:43:08,771 --> 01:43:10,271
There's no need for you to...

1470
01:43:10,471 --> 01:43:11,871
Answer it!

1471
01:43:12,571 --> 01:43:14,271
You be houseboy around here awhile.

1472
01:43:14,471 --> 01:43:16,471
You can start in
being houseboy right now.

1473
01:43:16,871 --> 01:43:18,471
Look, I'm no flunky to you.

1474
01:43:18,871 --> 01:43:21,371
Sure, you are!
You're ambitious, aren't you?

1475
01:43:21,671 --> 01:43:25,871
You didn't come back here with me
out of driven passion, did you?

1476
01:43:26,671 --> 01:43:29,471
You were thinking a little bit
about your career.

1477
01:43:30,371 --> 01:43:34,871
You can just houseboy your way up
the ladder for awhile.

1478
01:43:36,671 --> 01:43:38,071
There's no limit to you, is there?

1479
01:43:38,371 --> 01:43:40,571
No, baby, none. Go answer the door.

1480
01:43:40,871 --> 01:43:42,371
Go on, git!

1481
01:43:44,671 --> 01:43:46,171
Aimless. Wanton.

1482
01:43:46,571 --> 01:43:48,671
Now, you just do as you're told.

1483
01:43:49,071 --> 01:43:51,571
You show ol' Martha
there's something you can do.

1484
01:43:51,871 --> 01:43:54,171
I'm coming, for Christ's sake!

1485
01:43:54,571 --> 01:43:56,171
Wonderful! Marvelous!

1486
01:43:56,571 --> 01:43:59,271
Just a gigolo everywhere I go.

1487
01:43:59,571 --> 01:44:00,371
Stop that!

1488
01:44:00,871 --> 01:44:04,571
Sorry, baby. Now you go
answer the little door, huh?

1489
01:44:13,671 --> 01:44:15,571
How lovely!

1490
01:44:18,071 --> 01:44:21,571
Why, sonny, you came home
for your birthday at last!

1491
01:44:22,071 --> 01:44:23,471
Get away from me!

1492
01:44:24,071 --> 01:44:26,871
That's the houseboy, for God's sake!

1493
01:44:27,271 --> 01:44:31,371
That's not our own little Sonny-Jim,
our own all-American something or other?

1494
01:44:31,771 --> 01:44:35,771
I certainly hope not.
He's been acting awful funny if he is.

1495
01:44:36,071 --> 01:44:37,871
I'll bet. Chippie, chippie, huh?

1496
01:44:40,671 --> 01:44:42,671
I brung these flowers...

1497
01:44:44,971 --> 01:44:46,371
...'cause youse...

1498
01:44:47,171 --> 01:44:48,871
Aw, hell, Martha!

1499
01:44:50,671 --> 01:44:55,371
Pansies, rosemary, violence,
mah wedding bouquet!

1500
01:44:55,671 --> 01:44:57,371
If you don't mind, I'll get my wife...

1501
01:44:58,871 --> 01:45:02,071
You stay right where you are.
Make my hubby a drink.

1502
01:45:02,371 --> 01:45:03,671
I don't think I will.

1503
01:45:04,071 --> 01:45:08,371
No, Martha. That would be too much.
He's your houseboy, not mine.

1504
01:45:08,671 --> 01:45:10,671
I'm nobody's houseboy!

1505
01:45:12,671 --> 01:45:16,671
I'm nobody's houseboy now

1506
01:45:18,371 --> 01:45:19,171
Vicious.

1507
01:45:19,171 --> 01:45:20,671
Children? That right?

1508
01:45:21,071 --> 01:45:25,171
Vicious children with their sad games
hopscotching their way through life?

1509
01:45:25,571 --> 01:45:26,671
Something like that.

1510
01:45:27,071 --> 01:45:27,871
Screw, baby.

1511
01:45:28,171 --> 01:45:31,171
Him can't! Him too full o' booze!

1512
01:45:31,571 --> 01:45:34,871
Weally? Here! Dump these in some gin.

1513
01:45:37,571 --> 01:45:40,171
A terrible thing to do
to Martha's snapdragons!

1514
01:45:40,371 --> 01:45:41,871
Is that what they are?

1515
01:45:42,271 --> 01:45:46,371
Yup. And I went by moonlight to Daddy's
greenhouse to pick them for her.

1516
01:45:46,771 --> 01:45:49,571
There is no moon.
I saw it go down from the bedroom.

1517
01:45:49,871 --> 01:45:51,071
From the bedroom?

1518
01:45:53,271 --> 01:45:54,371
There is a moon.

1519
01:45:54,771 --> 01:45:57,271
There is no goddamn moon,
the moon went down.

1520
01:45:57,571 --> 01:45:59,271
That may be, Chastity,
but it came back up.

1521
01:45:59,471 --> 01:46:00,271
Bull!

1522
01:46:00,271 --> 01:46:03,471
Once when I was sailing past Majorca,
the moon went down...

1523
01:46:03,671 --> 01:46:06,771
...thought about it awhile then,
pop, came up again.

1524
01:46:07,071 --> 01:46:09,971
That is not true. That is such a lie!

1525
01:46:10,271 --> 01:46:12,571
You must not call everything a lie.
Must she?

1526
01:46:13,071 --> 01:46:15,071
I don't know when you people are lying.

1527
01:46:15,771 --> 01:46:18,271
- You're damn right!
- You're not supposed to.

1528
01:46:19,871 --> 01:46:23,771
- So, I was sailing past Majorca...
- You never sailed past Majorca.

1529
01:46:24,271 --> 01:46:27,771
You were never in
the Mediterranean at all, ever!

1530
01:46:28,071 --> 01:46:31,071
My mom and dad took me
as a college graduation present.

1531
01:46:31,771 --> 01:46:32,971
After you killed them?

1532
01:46:34,571 --> 01:46:35,671
Maybe.

1533
01:46:37,071 --> 01:46:39,471
Yeah. And maybe not too.

1534
01:46:40,171 --> 01:46:41,071
Jesus!

1535
01:46:41,671 --> 01:46:45,271
Truth and illusion. Who knows
the difference, toots? Houseboy?

1536
01:46:45,671 --> 01:46:46,471
I'm not a houseboy.

1537
01:46:46,771 --> 01:46:50,071
You don't make it in the sack,
you're a houseboy.

1538
01:46:50,971 --> 01:46:52,771
Then you must have made it, yes?

1539
01:46:53,471 --> 01:46:57,771
Somebody's lying, not playing the
game straight. Who's lying? Martha?

1540
01:46:58,671 --> 01:47:00,171
Tell him I'm not a houseboy.

1541
01:47:02,071 --> 01:47:03,971
You're not a houseboy.

1542
01:47:08,171 --> 01:47:09,171
So be it.

1543
01:47:11,171 --> 01:47:13,971
Truth and illusion.
You don't know the difference.

1544
01:47:14,971 --> 01:47:17,471
No, but we must carry on
as though we did.

1545
01:47:18,671 --> 01:47:19,871
Amen.

1546
01:47:21,671 --> 01:47:22,871
Snap went the dragons.

1547
01:47:23,071 --> 01:47:23,871
Thank you.

1548
01:47:24,771 --> 01:47:25,671
Skip it.

1549
01:47:25,971 --> 01:47:27,171
I said snap went the dragons!

1550
01:47:27,471 --> 01:47:28,871
Yeah, we know.

1551
01:47:29,871 --> 01:47:30,871
Don't!

1552
01:47:31,171 --> 01:47:32,371
Don't do that.

1553
01:47:32,671 --> 01:47:33,471
Shut up, stud!

1554
01:47:33,871 --> 01:47:34,871
I'm not a stud.

1555
01:47:35,171 --> 01:47:37,171
Then you're a houseboy. Which is it?

1556
01:47:37,971 --> 01:47:39,671
Does it matter to you?

1557
01:47:40,471 --> 01:47:43,471
No, actually it doesn't.
Either way I've had it.

1558
01:47:44,371 --> 01:47:47,071
Stop throwing these damn things at me!

1559
01:47:47,371 --> 01:47:49,571
- Either way. Snap!
- Shall I do something to him?

1560
01:47:49,871 --> 01:47:51,171
You leave him alone!

1561
01:47:51,571 --> 01:47:53,871
Which are you, baby, houseboy or stud?

1562
01:47:56,371 --> 01:47:59,871
Truth or illusion, George?
Doesn't it matter to you at all?

1563
01:48:02,871 --> 01:48:05,571
Snap! You got your answer, baby.

1564
01:48:10,871 --> 01:48:11,671
Got it.

1565
01:48:16,171 --> 01:48:18,571
You just gird your
blue-veined loins, girl.

1566
01:48:19,071 --> 01:48:22,071
There's one more game to play.
It's called Bringing up Baby.

1567
01:48:23,371 --> 01:48:26,371
I don't want a fuss. Don't want
any scandal around here, do you?

1568
01:48:26,771 --> 01:48:28,571
Want to keep to your timetable?
Then sit!

1569
01:48:29,271 --> 01:48:33,871
And you, pretty miss, you like fun and
games! You're a sport from way back!

1570
01:48:34,271 --> 01:48:35,271
All right.

1571
01:48:35,571 --> 01:48:37,771
Good. But we're not all here.

1572
01:48:40,571 --> 01:48:42,071
Your little wifelet isn't here.

1573
01:48:42,371 --> 01:48:43,771
She had a rough night...

1574
01:48:44,071 --> 01:48:47,371
We can't play without everybody.
We need your little wife.

1575
01:48:50,271 --> 01:48:51,271
Cut that!

1576
01:48:52,271 --> 01:48:55,571
Just get off your butt and bring
that little dip back in here!

1577
01:48:55,971 --> 01:48:58,971
Now be a good puppy, go fetch.
Fetch, good puppy.

1578
01:49:09,271 --> 01:49:10,371
One more game.

1579
01:49:18,871 --> 01:49:20,771
I don't like what's going to happen.

1580
01:49:21,271 --> 01:49:22,571
Do you know what it is?

1581
01:49:23,371 --> 01:49:25,871
No. But I don't like it.

1582
01:49:26,271 --> 01:49:27,871
Maybe you will, Martha.

1583
01:49:29,271 --> 01:49:31,071
It's a real fun game.

1584
01:49:31,371 --> 01:49:32,771
No more games.

1585
01:49:33,071 --> 01:49:36,971
One more, Martha. One more game
and then beddie-bye.

1586
01:49:37,271 --> 01:49:41,571
Everybody packs up his tools
and baggage and stuff and go home.

1587
01:49:41,971 --> 01:49:43,571
And you and me...

1588
01:49:44,171 --> 01:49:46,671
...we're going to climb
them well-worn stairs.

1589
01:49:46,971 --> 01:49:48,571
No, George, no.

1590
01:49:48,971 --> 01:49:50,271
Yes, baby.

1591
01:49:51,571 --> 01:49:53,771
It'll all be done before you know it.

1592
01:49:54,571 --> 01:49:56,571
No climb stairs with Georgie?

1593
01:49:56,971 --> 01:50:01,271
No more games. It's games I don't want.
No more games, please.

1594
01:50:01,571 --> 01:50:05,471
Sure you do. Original game girl!
Of course you do.

1595
01:50:08,671 --> 01:50:10,471
Don't you touch me!

1596
01:50:11,171 --> 01:50:12,871
Keep your paws clean
for the undergraduates.

1597
01:50:14,971 --> 01:50:15,971
Listen to me!

1598
01:50:16,271 --> 01:50:17,571
You've had an evening.

1599
01:50:17,771 --> 01:50:22,271
You can't stop when there's enough
blood in your mouth. We're going on.

1600
01:50:22,571 --> 01:50:26,271
I'm having at you, and your performance
will look like an Easter pageant.

1601
01:50:26,671 --> 01:50:27,871
Get yourself alert.

1602
01:50:28,171 --> 01:50:29,671
- Get some life in you.
- Stop!

1603
01:50:29,871 --> 01:50:31,071
Pull yourself together!

1604
01:50:31,471 --> 01:50:34,571
I'm going to knock you around
and I want you up for it!

1605
01:50:35,571 --> 01:50:36,771
What do you want?

1606
01:50:36,971 --> 01:50:38,771
- An equal battle.
- You'll get it.

1607
01:50:38,971 --> 01:50:41,471
- I want you mad.
- I'm mad. Don't worry about it!

1608
01:50:42,171 --> 01:50:44,271
Good girl!
We'll play to the death.

1609
01:50:44,471 --> 01:50:46,371
- Yours?
- You'll be surprised.

1610
01:50:46,671 --> 01:50:47,971
Here come the tots. Be ready.

1611
01:50:48,371 --> 01:50:49,271
I'm ready for you.

1612
01:50:49,771 --> 01:50:52,171
Hip, hop. Hip, hip, hop.

1613
01:50:52,371 --> 01:50:54,471
Are you a bunny, honey!

1614
01:50:54,871 --> 01:50:57,071
- How's the bunny?
- Bunny funny!

1615
01:50:57,471 --> 01:50:58,971
Bunny funny. Good for bunny.

1616
01:50:59,471 --> 01:51:00,671
Honey funny bunny.

1617
01:51:02,871 --> 01:51:04,171
All right, here we go.

1618
01:51:04,471 --> 01:51:06,171
Last game. All sit.

1619
01:51:07,371 --> 01:51:11,171
- Sit down. This is a civilized game.
- Just get on with it.

1620
01:51:11,671 --> 01:51:15,671
I think we've been having a real good
evening, all things considered.

1621
01:51:16,071 --> 01:51:18,871
We've got to know each other.
And we've had fun and games.

1622
01:51:19,671 --> 01:51:21,071
Like Curl Up On The Floor.

1623
01:51:21,171 --> 01:51:21,971
The Tiles.

1624
01:51:22,171 --> 01:51:23,571
The Tiles, Snap The Dragon.

1625
01:51:24,071 --> 01:51:24,871
Peel the Label!

1626
01:51:26,071 --> 01:51:27,971
Label. Peel the Label.

1627
01:51:28,371 --> 01:51:29,871
I peel labels.

1628
01:51:30,071 --> 01:51:32,071
We all peel labels, sweetie.

1629
01:51:32,371 --> 01:51:35,371
When you get through the skin,
and through the muscle...

1630
01:51:35,671 --> 01:51:39,871
...and slosh aside the organs, down to
the bone, you know what you do?

1631
01:51:41,071 --> 01:51:42,671
When you get down to the bone...

1632
01:51:43,071 --> 01:51:45,471
...you aren't all the way.
Something's inside the bone.

1633
01:51:45,871 --> 01:51:47,971
The marrow.
That's what you got to get at.

1634
01:51:48,571 --> 01:51:51,671
But bones are pretty resilient,
especially in the young.

1635
01:51:52,071 --> 01:51:53,171
Now take our son...

1636
01:51:55,871 --> 01:51:57,871
Our son. Martha's and my little joy.

1637
01:51:59,971 --> 01:52:01,371
Just what are you doing?

1638
01:52:01,571 --> 01:52:03,971
- I'm talking about our son.
- Well, don't.

1639
01:52:04,371 --> 01:52:06,571
I want to.
It's important we talk about him.

1640
01:52:06,871 --> 01:52:09,871
You want to hear about our
bouncy boy, don't you?

1641
01:52:11,371 --> 01:52:13,371
Martha's and my son.

1642
01:52:15,871 --> 01:52:17,271
You have a child?

1643
01:52:17,571 --> 01:52:19,671
Yes indeed, do we ever!

1644
01:52:20,071 --> 01:52:21,571
Will you talk about him or shall I?

1645
01:52:21,771 --> 01:52:24,471
- Don't.
- All rightie, now let's see.

1646
01:52:24,671 --> 01:52:26,471
He's nice, despite home his life.

1647
01:52:26,771 --> 01:52:30,571
Most kids would be neurotic,
Martha carrying on the way she does.

1648
01:52:30,971 --> 01:52:34,071
Sleeping till 4 p. M.
Climbing over the poor bastard...

1649
01:52:34,471 --> 01:52:38,871
...trying to break the bathroom door
to wash him in the tub when he's 16.

1650
01:52:39,471 --> 01:52:41,571
Dragging strangers
to the house all hours.

1651
01:52:43,471 --> 01:52:44,571
That's enough.

1652
01:52:44,971 --> 01:52:46,171
Do you want to take over?

1653
01:52:46,471 --> 01:52:49,071
Why would anyone want to
wash a 16 year-old?

1654
01:52:49,471 --> 01:52:50,771
For Christ's sake!

1655
01:52:51,071 --> 01:52:52,171
Well, why?

1656
01:52:52,371 --> 01:52:53,871
Because it's her baby-poo.

1657
01:52:54,271 --> 01:52:55,371
All right.

1658
01:52:55,771 --> 01:52:58,771
Our son, you want our son?
You'll have it.

1659
01:53:01,671 --> 01:53:02,771
Do you want a drink?

1660
01:53:06,771 --> 01:53:09,271
We don't have to hear it
if you don't want to.

1661
01:53:09,671 --> 01:53:12,071
Who says? You in a position
to set the rules?

1662
01:53:14,471 --> 01:53:15,971
Good boy. You'll go far.

1663
01:53:16,771 --> 01:53:18,771
All right, your recitation please.

1664
01:53:24,771 --> 01:53:25,871
Our son...

1665
01:53:26,171 --> 01:53:27,071
All right!

1666
01:53:28,171 --> 01:53:29,271
Our son.

1667
01:53:31,871 --> 01:53:35,771
Our son was born in a September night,
a night not unlike tonight...

1668
01:53:37,871 --> 01:53:39,071
...though tomorrow...

1669
01:53:39,871 --> 01:53:41,671
...and sixteen years ago.

1670
01:53:41,871 --> 01:53:43,271
See, I told you.

1671
01:53:44,671 --> 01:53:48,071
- It was an easy birth.
- No, you labored, how you labored!

1672
01:53:48,471 --> 01:53:49,971
It was an easy birth!

1673
01:53:50,871 --> 01:53:52,571
Once it had been...

1674
01:53:52,771 --> 01:53:54,171
...accepted.

1675
01:53:54,971 --> 01:53:57,771
- Relaxed into.
- That's better.

1676
01:53:58,871 --> 01:54:02,171
It was an easy birth,
once it had been accepted.

1677
01:54:03,671 --> 01:54:05,271
And I was young.

1678
01:54:05,671 --> 01:54:07,471
And he was healthy...

1679
01:54:08,571 --> 01:54:10,871
...a red, bawling child.

1680
01:54:11,371 --> 01:54:13,671
Martha thinks she saw him at delivery.

1681
01:54:14,171 --> 01:54:16,371
With slippery, firm limbs.

1682
01:54:17,571 --> 01:54:21,371
And a full head of black, fine hair.

1683
01:54:22,571 --> 01:54:23,871
Which, later...

1684
01:54:24,571 --> 01:54:25,671
...later became...

1685
01:54:27,771 --> 01:54:29,171
...blond as the sun.

1686
01:54:30,871 --> 01:54:32,171
Our son.

1687
01:54:32,571 --> 01:54:33,871
He was a healthy child.

1688
01:54:35,371 --> 01:54:39,271
And I had wanted a child.
Oh, I had wanted a child!

1689
01:54:39,571 --> 01:54:41,171
A son? Daughter?

1690
01:54:41,571 --> 01:54:42,571
A child!

1691
01:54:47,571 --> 01:54:49,171
I had my child.

1692
01:54:49,571 --> 01:54:50,671
Our child.

1693
01:54:53,771 --> 01:54:55,171
And we raised him.

1694
01:54:58,071 --> 01:55:00,071
Yes, we did. We raised him.

1695
01:55:03,371 --> 01:55:06,571
And he had green eyes.

1696
01:55:08,571 --> 01:55:12,171
Such green, green eyes.

1697
01:55:13,471 --> 01:55:15,271
Blue, green, brown.

1698
01:55:16,271 --> 01:55:17,971
And he loved the sun.

1699
01:55:18,271 --> 01:55:21,671
And he was tan
before and after everyone.

1700
01:55:23,771 --> 01:55:25,371
And in the sun...

1701
01:55:26,271 --> 01:55:27,771
...his hair became...

1702
01:55:28,771 --> 01:55:29,871
...fleece.

1703
01:55:33,971 --> 01:55:36,871
Beautiful, beautiful boy.

1704
01:55:42,271 --> 01:55:45,171
So beautiful, so wise.

1705
01:55:45,671 --> 01:55:47,071
All truth being relative.

1706
01:55:48,171 --> 01:55:49,471
It was true.

1707
01:55:51,171 --> 01:55:53,471
Beautiful, wise, perfect!

1708
01:55:53,671 --> 01:55:55,271
There's a real mother talking.

1709
01:55:55,571 --> 01:55:57,471
I want a child!

1710
01:55:59,171 --> 01:56:00,071
On principle?

1711
01:56:00,471 --> 01:56:02,971
I want a child. I want a baby.

1712
01:56:03,471 --> 01:56:05,571
This perfection could not last.

1713
01:56:06,671 --> 01:56:08,171
Not with George.

1714
01:56:09,371 --> 01:56:10,771
Not with George around.

1715
01:56:10,971 --> 01:56:12,371
There, you see, I knew she'd shift.

1716
01:56:12,571 --> 01:56:14,271
- Be still!
- Sorry, Mother.

1717
01:56:14,471 --> 01:56:15,871
Can't you be still?

1718
01:56:16,671 --> 01:56:21,071
Not with George. A drowning man takes
down those nearest, and he tried.

1719
01:56:21,871 --> 01:56:24,771
And, God, how I fought him!
How I fought him!

1720
01:56:25,171 --> 01:56:26,471
The one thing...

1721
01:56:26,871 --> 01:56:29,271
...I tried to carry unscathed
through the...

1722
01:56:30,371 --> 01:56:31,671
...sewer of our marriage...

1723
01:56:32,171 --> 01:56:35,771
...through the sick nights and the
pathetic, stupid days...

1724
01:56:36,171 --> 01:56:39,471
...through the derision and the
laughter. God, the laughter!

1725
01:56:40,871 --> 01:56:43,471
Through one failure after another.

1726
01:56:43,871 --> 01:56:47,671
Each attempt more numbing,
more sickening than the one before.

1727
01:56:48,571 --> 01:56:51,871
The one thing, the one person
I tried to protect...

1728
01:56:52,571 --> 01:56:56,971
...to raise above the mire of this vile,
crushing marriage...

1729
01:56:57,871 --> 01:57:01,871
...the one light in all this
hopeless darkness! Our son!

1730
01:57:02,071 --> 01:57:02,871
Stop it!

1731
01:57:07,471 --> 01:57:08,971
Why, don't you like it?

1732
01:57:09,371 --> 01:57:10,671
You can't do this.

1733
01:57:10,871 --> 01:57:11,671
Who says?

1734
01:57:11,671 --> 01:57:14,071
- I say!
- Tell us why, baby.

1735
01:57:15,071 --> 01:57:16,471
Is this game over?

1736
01:57:19,071 --> 01:57:20,971
Oh, no! Not by a long shot.

1737
01:57:22,071 --> 01:57:24,871
I've got a surprise for you.
It's about sonny-Jim.

1738
01:57:26,871 --> 01:57:28,371
I'm running this show!

1739
01:57:29,371 --> 01:57:30,371
Sweetheart...

1740
01:57:31,071 --> 01:57:33,871
...I'm afraid I've got
some bad news for you.

1741
01:57:34,071 --> 01:57:36,371
For both of us, I mean.
Some rather sad news.

1742
01:57:37,371 --> 01:57:38,871
What is this?

1743
01:57:39,071 --> 01:57:43,071
Martha, while you were busy,
while the two of you were busy...

1744
01:57:43,371 --> 01:57:45,371
...I don't know where,
but you were somewhere...

1745
01:57:45,871 --> 01:57:47,771
...while you were busy for awhile...

1746
01:57:48,571 --> 01:57:51,271
...Missy and I
were having a little talk.

1747
01:57:51,471 --> 01:57:53,571
You know, a chaw and a talk.

1748
01:57:53,771 --> 01:57:55,471
And the doorbell rang.

1749
01:57:55,671 --> 01:57:56,671
Chimed.

1750
01:58:03,271 --> 01:58:04,571
It's hard for me to tell you.

1751
01:58:06,271 --> 01:58:07,471
Please don't!

1752
01:58:07,771 --> 01:58:08,771
Tell me!

1753
01:58:09,771 --> 01:58:13,771
It was good old Western Union,
some little boy about seventy.

1754
01:58:14,771 --> 01:58:15,671
Crazy Billy?

1755
01:58:16,071 --> 01:58:17,571
That's right. Crazy Billy.

1756
01:58:18,271 --> 01:58:20,771
And he had a telegram and it was for us.

1757
01:58:22,771 --> 01:58:23,871
I have to tell you about it.

1758
01:58:25,471 --> 01:58:29,771
Why did they bring it?
Why didn't they telephone it?

1759
01:58:30,271 --> 01:58:34,871
There are some telegrams you have to
deliver, Martha. Some you cannot phone.

1760
01:58:36,271 --> 01:58:37,571
What do you mean?

1761
01:58:40,271 --> 01:58:41,971
I can hardly bring myself to say it.

1762
01:58:42,971 --> 01:58:44,071
You want to do it?

1763
01:58:49,771 --> 01:58:54,271
Well, Martha, I'm afraid our boy
isn't coming home for his birthday.

1764
01:58:55,171 --> 01:58:56,571
Of course he is!

1765
01:58:57,471 --> 01:58:59,071
Of course he is! I say he is!

1766
01:58:59,471 --> 01:59:00,271
He can't.

1767
01:59:04,671 --> 01:59:05,871
Our son...

1768
01:59:06,971 --> 01:59:07,971
...is...

1769
01:59:09,571 --> 01:59:10,371
...dead.

1770
01:59:11,971 --> 01:59:14,671
He was killed late in the afternoon...

1771
01:59:15,371 --> 01:59:17,571
...on a country road with his
learner's permit.

1772
01:59:17,771 --> 01:59:20,271
He swerved to avoid a porcupine
and drove...

1773
01:59:20,671 --> 01:59:21,771
You can't do that!

1774
01:59:22,871 --> 01:59:24,171
...into a large tree.

1775
01:59:25,271 --> 01:59:26,771
You cannot do that!

1776
01:59:28,471 --> 01:59:29,971
I thought you should know.

1777
01:59:31,771 --> 01:59:33,471
You cannot do that!

1778
01:59:33,771 --> 01:59:36,671
You can't decide these things
for yourself!

1779
01:59:37,271 --> 01:59:39,171
I will not let you do that!

1780
01:59:39,471 --> 01:59:41,171
Have to leave around noon, I suppose.

1781
01:59:41,471 --> 01:59:43,471
I won't let you decide these things.

1782
01:59:43,671 --> 01:59:46,971
There are matters of identification,
arrangements to be made.

1783
01:59:47,371 --> 01:59:49,471
You can't do this! I won't let you!

1784
01:59:50,171 --> 01:59:52,971
- Get your hands off me!
- I haven't done anything!

1785
01:59:53,371 --> 01:59:55,671
Now you listen to me. Our son is dead!

1786
01:59:55,871 --> 01:59:57,471
Can you get that through your head?

1787
01:59:58,471 --> 02:00:02,871
Listen carefully. We got a telegram.
There was a car accident and he's dead!

1788
02:00:03,171 --> 02:00:05,871
Poof! Just like that!
Now how do you like it?

1789
02:00:09,971 --> 02:00:11,971
Let her go.
She'll be all right.

1790
02:00:23,171 --> 02:00:25,571
He is not dead.

1791
02:00:28,071 --> 02:00:29,071
He is dead.

1792
02:00:34,371 --> 02:00:36,671
You cannot decide.

1793
02:00:37,671 --> 02:00:39,171
He hasn't decided anything.

1794
02:00:39,571 --> 02:00:42,671
It's not his doing.
He doesn't have the power.

1795
02:00:43,071 --> 02:00:47,371
That's right. I'm no god. I have
no power over life and death, do I?

1796
02:00:49,271 --> 02:00:51,371
You can't kill him.

1797
02:00:51,771 --> 02:00:54,271
You can't let him die!

1798
02:00:59,171 --> 02:01:00,571
There was a telegram.

1799
02:01:04,271 --> 02:01:07,571
Show it to me! Show me that telegram!

1800
02:01:12,571 --> 02:01:13,571
I ate it.

1801
02:01:14,871 --> 02:01:17,071
What did you just say to me?

1802
02:01:18,171 --> 02:01:20,771
I ate it.

1803
02:01:24,071 --> 02:01:25,471
Good for you, Martha.

1804
02:01:26,071 --> 02:01:28,971
You make a joke at a time like this?

1805
02:01:29,171 --> 02:01:30,571
Did I not eat the telegram?

1806
02:01:30,771 --> 02:01:33,571
You ate it. I watched you
and you ate it all down.

1807
02:01:33,971 --> 02:01:34,971
Like a good boy.

1808
02:01:36,471 --> 02:01:38,371
You won't get away with this.

1809
02:01:40,571 --> 02:01:42,971
You know the rules, for God's sake!

1810
02:01:44,271 --> 02:01:45,771
What are you talking about?

1811
02:01:46,071 --> 02:01:47,471
I can kill him if I want to.

1812
02:01:47,771 --> 02:01:48,871
He is our child.

1813
02:01:49,071 --> 02:01:52,371
- You bore him. A good delivery.
- He is our child.

1814
02:01:52,571 --> 02:01:53,771
And I've killed him.

1815
02:01:56,171 --> 02:01:58,671
Oh my God, I think I understand this.

1816
02:01:59,171 --> 02:02:00,071
Do you?

1817
02:02:00,871 --> 02:02:04,171
- Oh my God, I think I understand this.
- Good for you.

1818
02:02:08,871 --> 02:02:12,071
You've no right.
You've no right at all.

1819
02:02:12,271 --> 02:02:16,771
I have the right, we never spoke of it.
I could kill him any time I wanted.

1820
02:02:16,971 --> 02:02:18,671
Why?

1821
02:02:18,971 --> 02:02:20,171
You broke our rule, Martha.

1822
02:02:20,471 --> 02:02:23,971
You mentioned him to somebody else.

1823
02:02:24,271 --> 02:02:26,171
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

1824
02:02:29,671 --> 02:02:31,671
To me, you mentioned him to me.

1825
02:02:34,871 --> 02:02:35,971
I forget.

1826
02:02:37,371 --> 02:02:41,271
Sometimes when it's late night
and everybody's talking...

1827
02:02:41,671 --> 02:02:43,671
...I forget and I want to mention him.

1828
02:02:43,971 --> 02:02:46,671
But I hold on. I hold on.

1829
02:02:48,071 --> 02:02:50,671
I've wanted to so often.

1830
02:02:51,671 --> 02:02:53,671
But, George, you've pushed it.

1831
02:02:53,971 --> 02:02:57,171
There was no need,
there was no need for this!

1832
02:02:58,871 --> 02:03:00,671
I mentioned him, all right?

1833
02:03:01,971 --> 02:03:04,571
But you didn't have
to push it over the edge.

1834
02:03:05,371 --> 02:03:07,371
You didn't have to kill him.

1835
02:03:15,371 --> 02:03:18,871
You didn't have to have him die.

1836
02:03:24,571 --> 02:03:27,171
That wasn't needed.

1837
02:03:56,871 --> 02:03:58,371
It's dawn.

1838
02:03:59,971 --> 02:04:01,871
I think the party's over.

1839
02:04:07,771 --> 02:04:09,471
You couldn't have any?

1840
02:04:12,171 --> 02:04:13,371
We couldn't.

1841
02:04:18,271 --> 02:04:21,071
Home to bed, children.
It's way past your bedtime.

1842
02:04:32,071 --> 02:04:33,471
You two go now.

1843
02:04:47,771 --> 02:04:49,671
- I'd like to...
- Goodnight.

1844
02:05:16,771 --> 02:05:18,171
You want anything?

1845
02:05:19,471 --> 02:05:20,971
No. Nothing.

1846
02:05:26,771 --> 02:05:28,171
Time for bed.

1847
02:05:34,871 --> 02:05:35,871
Tired?

1848
02:05:36,271 --> 02:05:37,271
Yes.

1849
02:05:38,571 --> 02:05:39,571
I am.

1850
02:05:48,971 --> 02:05:50,571
Sunday tomorrow.

1851
02:05:52,971 --> 02:05:54,171
All day.

1852
02:06:31,771 --> 02:06:33,771
Did you have to?

1853
02:06:35,871 --> 02:06:36,871
Yes.

1854
02:06:41,771 --> 02:06:43,071
You had to?

1855
02:06:49,771 --> 02:06:50,871
I don't know.

1856
02:06:54,371 --> 02:06:56,571
- It was time.
- Was it?

1857
02:07:07,971 --> 02:07:09,371
I'm cold.

1858
02:07:11,971 --> 02:07:12,971
It's late.

1859
02:07:25,571 --> 02:07:26,971
It will be better.

1860
02:07:30,371 --> 02:07:31,871
I don't know.

1861
02:07:32,971 --> 02:07:34,671
It will be. Maybe.

1862
02:07:37,171 --> 02:07:38,971
I'm not sure.

1863
02:07:47,771 --> 02:07:48,971
Just us?

1864
02:07:53,471 --> 02:07:55,171
- You don't suppose maybe...
- No.

1865
02:08:09,171 --> 02:08:10,871
- You all right?
- Yes.

1866
02:08:16,671 --> 02:08:17,671
No.

1867
02:08:22,871 --> 02:08:26,271
Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?

1868
02:08:28,671 --> 02:08:29,971
I am, George.

1869
02:08:33,671 --> 02:08:34,971
I am, George.

1870
02:08:36,971 --> 02:08:38,071
I am.
