1
00:00:23,801 --> 00:00:25,386
Quiet on the set.

2
00:00:27,054 --> 00:00:29,098
Scene one, take ten.
Marker.

3
00:00:36,397 --> 00:00:38,941
And action!

4
00:00:41,194 --> 00:00:43,154
Joel Levison's office.

5
00:00:43,237 --> 00:00:46,783
l'm sorry, he's not in yet.
May l take a message?

6
00:00:46,866 --> 00:00:49,660
- Mr. Levy, l'll tell him you called.
- Never say that.

7
00:00:49,744 --> 00:00:53,080
He's either in conference, in a meeting.
He's always in.

8
00:00:53,164 --> 00:00:55,333
- Who was that?
- Larry Levy.

9
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:59,212
Was there anything in the trades
this morning?

10
00:00:59,295 --> 00:01:02,840
- l don't know. The mail's late.
- Go get them. Now!

11
00:01:02,924 --> 00:01:06,135
l want them back here
before he arrives.

12
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:25,113
Griffin, hi. Adam Simon.

13
00:01:25,196 --> 00:01:27,532
We weren't supposed to meet
until next week, but--

14
00:01:27,615 --> 00:01:31,661
- l didn't know we were.
- l wanted to plant a seed in your head.

15
00:01:31,744 --> 00:01:34,247
- l'm booked up.
- Picture this.

16
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,999
lt's a planet in the far future
with two suns.

17
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:39,293
- Who plays the sons?
- No, suns. Large solar disks.

18
00:01:39,377 --> 00:01:41,295
Run this idea by Bonnie Sherow.

19
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:44,757
The pictures they make these days
are all MTV. Cut, cut, cut.

20
00:01:44,841 --> 00:01:48,302
The opening shot of Touch of Evil
was six and a half minutes long.

21
00:01:48,386 --> 00:01:50,847
- Six and a half minutes?
- Three or four, anyway.

22
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,142
He set up the whole picture
with that one tracking shot.

23
00:01:54,225 --> 00:01:56,602
My father was key grip on that shoot.

24
00:01:56,686 --> 00:02:00,898
What about Absolute Beginners?
That was an extraordinary shot.

25
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,235
- Never heard of it.
- lt's an English film.

26
00:02:08,614 --> 00:02:11,701
- A Peligrino, please.
- l've got Calistoga.

27
00:02:11,784 --> 00:02:13,828
- Buck, how are you?
- Good. How you doin'?

28
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:18,249
- Good. What have you got for me?
- Okay, here it is.

29
00:02:18,332 --> 00:02:21,169
- The Graduate, Part ll.
- Oh, good.

30
00:02:21,252 --> 00:02:24,255
Listen, the three principals
are still with us.

31
00:02:24,338 --> 00:02:29,802
Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft,
Katharine Ross, 25 years later.

32
00:02:29,886 --> 00:02:34,849
And so are the characters,
Ben, Elaine and Mrs. Robinson.

33
00:02:34,932 --> 00:02:36,851
Ben and Elaine are married, still.

34
00:02:36,934 --> 00:02:41,606
They live in a big, spooky house
up in northern California somewhere.

35
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:44,776
And Mrs. Robinson
lives with them...

36
00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:49,572
her aging mother
who's had a stroke...

37
00:02:49,614 --> 00:02:51,574
so she can't talk.

38
00:02:51,616 --> 00:02:55,203
- Will it be funny?
- lt'll be funny. Dark, weird and funny.

39
00:02:55,286 --> 00:02:58,623
And with a stroke.
Maybe it's not a stroke.

40
00:02:58,706 --> 00:03:01,375
l don't know what it is.
lt's a malady of some sort.

41
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:05,046
She's up in the bedroom listening
to everything that happens.

42
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:08,049
They've got a daughter
who's just graduated from college.

43
00:03:08,132 --> 00:03:12,470
Twenty-two, twenty-three-year-old,
like a Julia Roberts.

44
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,555
Excuse me.
What should l do with these scripts?

45
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,977
They go to Bonnie. And find out from
security how Adam Simon got on the lot.

46
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:23,981
- l want to know.
- Adam Simon? Okay.

47
00:03:24,065 --> 00:03:27,151
Julia Roberts comes home,
their daughter, the graduate.

48
00:03:27,235 --> 00:03:29,070
The new graduate.

49
00:03:29,153 --> 00:03:31,781
Griffin loved it.
He wanted me to run it by you.

50
00:03:31,864 --> 00:03:37,203
- lt's a band of human survivors.
- Write this down for me.

51
00:03:37,286 --> 00:03:40,373
l can't process this.
Write it down for me.

52
00:03:40,456 --> 00:03:43,584
lt's not about words.
You have to visualize.

53
00:03:46,963 --> 00:03:51,050
Jimmy, are you okay?
What happened?

54
00:03:52,385 --> 00:03:55,930
- Are you all right?
- My name's Jimmy Chase.

55
00:03:57,974 --> 00:04:01,644
He came out of nowhere, ran right
in front of the cart. l never saw him.

56
00:04:06,607 --> 00:04:08,901
- That's Adam Simon.
- How you doin', kid?

57
00:04:18,327 --> 00:04:21,706
Rebecca DeMornay.
Actually, you're better looking.

58
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:24,834
- No, l'm not Rebecca DeMornay.
- You're a dead ringer.

59
00:04:24,876 --> 00:04:26,586
Thank you very much.

60
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:29,422
Do you know where
Joel Levison's office is?

61
00:04:29,505 --> 00:04:32,341
The head of the studio?

62
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,343
lt's moving.
lt'll rip your heart out.

63
00:04:34,385 --> 00:04:39,265
This is the area where we make decisions
to give a green light to a picture.

64
00:04:39,348 --> 00:04:43,853
We're going to go 17 stories high.
We'll continue to use all Sony products.

65
00:04:43,895 --> 00:04:46,939
Domo arigato to the Sony products.

66
00:04:47,023 --> 00:04:51,527
lf you need someone to eat sashimi
with you, give me a ring.

67
00:04:57,784 --> 00:05:00,077
The traffic from Malibu
was impossible.

68
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:03,748
- Good morning, Joel.
- Sandy, park the car, please.

69
00:05:03,831 --> 00:05:05,833
Good morning Marty, Annie.

70
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,632
- What are the Japs doing here?
- What's this talk about heads rolling?

71
00:05:12,715 --> 00:05:15,843
The bank's putting screws to us.
Goldman's son is coming out from Boston.

72
00:05:15,927 --> 00:05:17,345
l don't like it.

73
00:05:17,428 --> 00:05:20,890
Reggie Goldman's a pipsqueak.
You can't be serious.

74
00:05:20,932 --> 00:05:25,186
Some changes are going on here.
That's always the way.

75
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:28,106
lt happened at Paramount
three years ago.

76
00:05:28,147 --> 00:05:30,233
Columbia's going through it now.

77
00:05:30,316 --> 00:05:32,610
l hear we're looking
to replace Griffin.

78
00:05:32,652 --> 00:05:34,987
Griffin? l don't believe it.
With whom?

79
00:05:35,071 --> 00:05:38,449
Burke or Patrick.
Maybe Larry Levy.

80
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:42,245
l want to know why
the security is lax.

81
00:05:42,286 --> 00:05:45,289
l'll talk to you later.
l'm in the middle of a pitch.

82
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:47,542
Listen, go ahead.

83
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:52,922
- lt's a TV star who goes on a safari.
- A TV star in a motion picture?

84
00:05:52,964 --> 00:05:57,927
- A TV star played by a movie star.
- A movie star playing a TV star.

85
00:05:57,969 --> 00:06:02,306
- Michelle, Bette, Lily.
- Dolly Parton would be good.

86
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:07,645
- l like Goldie.
- Great, because we have a relationship.

87
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:10,189
Goldie goes to Africa.

88
00:06:10,273 --> 00:06:15,945
- She's found by this tribe.
- Of small people.

89
00:06:16,028 --> 00:06:18,906
She's found and they worship her.

90
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:23,786
lt's like The Gods Must Be Crazy
except the coke bottle is an actress.

91
00:06:23,828 --> 00:06:26,456
Right. lt's Out of Africa
meets Pretty Woman.

92
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:30,126
She has to decide whether to stay
with the TV show...

93
00:06:30,168 --> 00:06:32,670
or save the tribe.

94
00:06:32,753 --> 00:06:35,715
- Where's Griffin Mill's office?
- Right here.

95
00:06:35,798 --> 00:06:38,718
- You're Martin Scorsese!
- No, but l know Harvey Keitel.

96
00:06:38,801 --> 00:06:42,305
l know you do.
l loved Cape Fear.

97
00:06:42,346 --> 00:06:45,057
My old man worked for Hitchcock.

98
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:47,393
Rope. lt was a masterpiece.

99
00:06:47,477 --> 00:06:50,271
The story wasn't any good.
He shot the whole thing without cuts.

100
00:06:50,354 --> 00:06:52,231
l hate all this 'Cut, cut, cut!'

101
00:06:52,315 --> 00:06:57,820
What about Bertolucci, the great shot
with Winger in Sheltering Sky?

102
00:06:57,862 --> 00:06:59,947
l didn't see it.

103
00:07:03,326 --> 00:07:07,330
- l've been here since 8:00.
- l took a chance getting you this job.

104
00:07:07,413 --> 00:07:11,375
- Who were you with?
- l was with Alan Rudolph.

105
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:16,380
- What were you doing with him?
- He asked me to have coffee.

106
00:07:16,422 --> 00:07:19,008
You're my assistant.
You don't get involved with writers.

107
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,969
l wasn't getting involved. l was
listening to this amazing idea he had.

108
00:07:22,053 --> 00:07:24,555
That's interesting.
What's your pitch?

109
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,059
- Does political scare you?
- Political doesn't scare me.

110
00:07:28,142 --> 00:07:30,853
Radical political scares me.
Political political scares me.

111
00:07:30,895 --> 00:07:34,440
This is politely politically radical,
but it's funny.

112
00:07:34,524 --> 00:07:38,820
- lt's a funny political thing.
- And it's a thriller, too, all at once.

113
00:07:38,903 --> 00:07:43,032
-What's the story?
-l want Bruce Willis. l can talk to him.

114
00:07:43,116 --> 00:07:46,577
lt's a story about a bad-guy senator.

115
00:07:46,661 --> 00:07:51,124
He's traveling around the country
on the country's dime, like Sununu did.

116
00:07:51,207 --> 00:07:53,668
lt's a cynical, political
thriller comedy.

117
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:59,006
But it's got heart in the right spot.
Anyway, he has an accident.

118
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:03,886
And he becomes clairvoyant,
like a psychic.

119
00:08:03,928 --> 00:08:07,056
So it's a psychic, political,
thriller comedy with a heart.

120
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:11,477
With a heart, not unlike Ghost
meets Manchurian Candidate.

121
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:15,064
- Go on, l'm listening.
- He starts reading people's minds.

122
00:08:15,148 --> 00:08:19,735
And when he gets to the President's mind
it's completely blank.

123
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:22,071
- Can l get you anything?
- l'd like a beer, please.

124
00:08:22,113 --> 00:08:25,241
- We don't have beer.
- Red wine, please.

125
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:31,998
Someone gets killed at the end.
They always do in political thrillers.

126
00:08:32,123 --> 00:08:36,377
- Griffin Mill's office.
- Can you put him on?

127
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:40,173
- May l ask who's calling?
- l'd like to speak to Griffin Mill.

128
00:08:40,256 --> 00:08:44,427
He's in a meeting right now. l can take
your name and have him get back to you.

129
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:47,889
- Excuse me?
- He'll get back to me?

130
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:51,392
- Do you know how often l've heard this?
- Who is this?

131
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:54,562
- lf he doesn't get back to me--
- Who was that?

132
00:08:54,645 --> 00:08:57,648
- l don't know. He didn't say.
- What do you mean?

133
00:08:57,732 --> 00:09:03,029
l don't know how you'll cast it. The
lead is a 50-year-old circus performer.

134
00:09:03,112 --> 00:09:05,448
Let me read the coverage.

135
00:09:05,531 --> 00:09:07,617
Are we still having lunch
with Aaron Camp?

136
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,787
- What time?
- l made it for 1:00.

137
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,289
- Bad day?
- He's having writer's block.

138
00:09:15,374 --> 00:09:19,837
You have a meeting with Hutter and
Frank South this afternoon at 3:00.

139
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:23,591
l'll be here. Put this morning's
meetings on the computer. Thanks.

140
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:27,804
- Are you going now?
- l'm going to see Levison.

141
00:09:27,887 --> 00:09:30,807
Order me a Caesar salad
and a Crystal Geyser.

142
00:09:38,856 --> 00:09:42,235
About 5:00? Thanks, Sandy.

143
00:09:42,318 --> 00:09:44,612
Hi, Sandy.

144
00:09:44,654 --> 00:09:47,782
You can't go in there!
He's in a meeting.

145
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,786
lt's all right, Celia.

146
00:09:51,869 --> 00:09:55,498
l don't think you've met Reg Goldman.
You know his father Harvey.

147
00:09:55,581 --> 00:09:59,293
Yes, of course. Hi, Reg.
From the bank in Boston.

148
00:09:59,377 --> 00:10:04,465
- Reg is out here for a few weeks.
- Great. Business or pleasure?

149
00:10:04,507 --> 00:10:07,135
A little of both, l hope.

150
00:10:07,176 --> 00:10:08,970
Reg is thinking of producing.

151
00:10:09,053 --> 00:10:11,055
Really?

152
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:13,432
Yeah. Beats work,
doesn't it, Griffin?

153
00:10:13,516 --> 00:10:15,852
l'd like to play some tennis.
Do you play tennis?

154
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,312
Tennis? No.

155
00:10:18,354 --> 00:10:21,023
- l'm too busy.
- l was asking Walter.

156
00:10:21,107 --> 00:10:23,443
Do you know Meg Ryan?

157
00:10:23,526 --> 00:10:25,486
ls she seeing somebody?

158
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:29,157
Yeah, Reg. She's married.

159
00:10:30,366 --> 00:10:31,784
Shit.

160
00:10:31,868 --> 00:10:34,495
What about Winona Ryder?

161
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:39,459
You know, actually,
Walter is the guy to talk to.

162
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:41,878
Walter's got everybody's number.

163
00:10:41,961 --> 00:10:46,048
- Was there anything?
- No. You're real busy.

164
00:10:46,132 --> 00:10:49,510
l want that number, goddamn it.
l want that number.

165
00:10:49,552 --> 00:10:53,181
Oh, boy. What about this one?
Has she done anything?

166
00:10:54,307 --> 00:10:55,725
Celia.

167
00:10:57,143 --> 00:11:00,146
Griffin, don't ask.

168
00:11:00,229 --> 00:11:04,650
Don't ask, you don't know?
Or don't ask, l don't want to know?

169
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:07,028
Just don't ask.

170
00:11:08,154 --> 00:11:12,909
lf it's Reggie Goldman
you're concerned about, forget it.

171
00:11:12,992 --> 00:11:15,495
But be nice to him. He represents
a lot of money to this company.

172
00:11:15,578 --> 00:11:18,623
lt's not Reggie Goldman
l'm worried about.

173
00:11:18,706 --> 00:11:21,250
- lt's Larry Levy.
- Larry Levy?

174
00:11:22,251 --> 00:11:24,670
Larry Levy's at Fox, isn't he?

175
00:11:26,547 --> 00:11:28,758
Come on, Celia.

176
00:11:28,841 --> 00:11:31,969
There's a call for Celia
on line one.

177
00:11:32,053 --> 00:11:35,473
- Should l be looking for a job?
- Celia, are you there?

178
00:11:35,556 --> 00:11:39,894
Joel Levison's office.
Oh, Brad. Yeah.

179
00:11:39,936 --> 00:11:41,479
What?

180
00:11:41,562 --> 00:11:46,067
No, we couldn't sign Angelica Huston
for that. She's booked for two years.

181
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:50,738
Like a ghost story,
but it's not like Ghost.

182
00:11:54,242 --> 00:11:56,410
lt's a supernatural thing.

183
00:11:58,913 --> 00:12:01,624
Joel, Griffin Mill.
A friend of Jennifer's.

184
00:12:01,707 --> 00:12:04,836
No. You're Griffin Mill?
Really?

185
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,838
Good to see you.
l'm a big fan of yours.

186
00:12:06,921 --> 00:12:09,590
- l have that tie.
- You do?

187
00:12:16,013 --> 00:12:18,141
Did you order for me?

188
00:12:20,601 --> 00:12:24,313
Hi. Lunching with the enemy.

189
00:12:24,397 --> 00:12:26,357
Oh, come on.

190
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:29,569
So what's this we hear
about Larry Levy?

191
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:33,281
Larry Levy? lf he had half a brain,
he'd be dangerous.

192
00:12:35,241 --> 00:12:37,618
Aaron says he's coming
to the studio.

193
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,331
Aaron says? Why would you believe
anything he says?

194
00:12:42,415 --> 00:12:45,126
He said it with authority.

195
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:49,964
He's over there with Angelica Huston
and John Cusack.

196
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:53,134
He's in over his head.
He's gonna drown over there.

197
00:12:54,177 --> 00:12:56,721
He's the golden boy at Fox these days.

198
00:12:56,804 --> 00:12:59,640
Did you see that thing on him
in Variety last week?

199
00:12:59,724 --> 00:13:01,267
Two pages.

200
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:05,271
Angelica, Griffin Mill.
Good to see you. You're looking great.

201
00:13:05,354 --> 00:13:08,316
Johnny, Griffin Mill.
A big fan of yours.

202
00:13:08,357 --> 00:13:11,444
- You gonna be in Telluride this year?
- Probably in Park City.

203
00:13:11,527 --> 00:13:13,696
Great. We'll see you there.

204
00:13:15,364 --> 00:13:20,787
- What's happening with Glass Box?
- Let's not talk about Hollywood.

205
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,414
We're educated people.

206
00:13:28,544 --> 00:13:30,671
l'll call you later.

207
00:14:03,037 --> 00:14:05,498
- Talk to somebody about this.
- What?

208
00:14:05,581 --> 00:14:08,376
- You've gotten 5 postcards in 2 weeks.
- Seven, actually.

209
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:11,045
Why don't you talk to Studio Security?

210
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:13,256
l should call Walter Stuckel
and say what?

211
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:18,052
'Someone's sending me poison letters
and l would like for you to make me...

212
00:14:18,094 --> 00:14:21,722
the object of more ridicule now that
things are really shaky for me here.(

213
00:14:21,806 --> 00:14:23,266
l don't think so.

214
00:14:23,307 --> 00:14:25,351
l think they're coming from a writer.

215
00:14:25,435 --> 00:14:27,395
- Which one?
- Take your pick.

216
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:32,275
- ls there anything else?
- Yes, your attorney phoned.

217
00:14:32,358 --> 00:14:35,194
He wants you to attend a party
at his house tonight.

218
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:38,239
- Tell him l'm at a screening.
- Not that attorney. lt's Dick Mellen.

219
00:14:38,281 --> 00:14:39,740
What time?

220
00:14:39,782 --> 00:14:42,785
Cocktails at 7:30, dinner at 8:00.
Bring a date.

221
00:14:42,827 --> 00:14:45,079
And Bonnie Sherow is here to see you.

222
00:14:45,163 --> 00:14:48,124
Send her in.
Oh, here she is.

223
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:51,252
Can we go to the Springs this weekend?

224
00:14:51,335 --> 00:14:55,923
l want to have a massage,
a long soak in a hot tub...

225
00:14:55,965 --> 00:14:59,218
and have Margaritas administered
intravenously.

226
00:14:59,302 --> 00:15:01,512
l have a party at Dick Mellen's.
You want to come?

227
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:04,140
God, movie stars and power players.

228
00:15:04,223 --> 00:15:07,143
- And Vodka.
- Sure.

229
00:15:07,226 --> 00:15:10,438
lt'll be an early dinner,
and we'll go to my place afterwards.

230
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,440
- Can we?
- Yeah.

231
00:15:24,952 --> 00:15:28,748
Brokaw looks like he has
absolutely no intensity.

232
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,542
Ted Koppel looks loose,
and he goes after it...

233
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:33,920
and he digs in.

234
00:15:38,174 --> 00:15:40,718
Hi. How are you?

235
00:15:40,802 --> 00:15:43,095
Marlee, this is Bonnie Sherow.

236
00:15:43,137 --> 00:15:45,932
She read Tales of Fury.

237
00:15:47,058 --> 00:15:50,103
l loved it.
l thought it was wonderful.

238
00:15:50,186 --> 00:15:54,023
l think you're perfect for Ariel.
You're perfect for the part.

239
00:15:55,358 --> 00:15:58,277
We're going to make a couple changes
in the third act.

240
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:00,321
You should set up a meeting.

241
00:16:01,989 --> 00:16:03,950
Yeah, sure.

242
00:16:03,991 --> 00:16:05,993
- You have my number?
- Absolutely.

243
00:16:07,578 --> 00:16:10,081
Excuse me.
l'm going to say hello to those people.

244
00:16:10,164 --> 00:16:13,876
Don't talk about script changes
at parties.

245
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,797
lt was good of you to come.
Don't you look beautiful!

246
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,758
- You know Bonnie Sherow.
- Of course. How are you?

247
00:16:20,842 --> 00:16:23,886
- Tri-Star, right?
- She's at the studio.

248
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:29,267
That's what l meant. Bring Mr. Mill
a martini. And, Bonnie?

249
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:32,311
- l'll take a Ramlosa.
- l'll have a martini.

250
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:37,608
Rod Steiger's here.

251
00:16:37,692 --> 00:16:39,610
Talk to him about the Rudolph project.

252
00:16:39,694 --> 00:16:44,031
He's not that hot on it,
but see if you can get him to read it.

253
00:16:44,115 --> 00:16:46,826
You know who's here? Harry Belafonte.
Harry?

254
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:49,537
Come and say hello, will you?

255
00:16:51,622 --> 00:16:54,292
- Griffin Mill.
- Hi. Good to see you.

256
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:57,211
Bonnie Sherow.
She's gaga over you.

257
00:16:57,295 --> 00:17:01,007
l'm a big fan of yours. l saw you accept
the Nelson Mandela Courage Award.

258
00:17:02,341 --> 00:17:06,053
Who was the villain in Ghostbusters?

259
00:17:06,137 --> 00:17:09,015
You got me there.

260
00:17:09,056 --> 00:17:11,100
l got this--

261
00:17:13,102 --> 00:17:17,857
l got this postcard.
Harassment kind of stuff.

262
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:20,693
What are you talking about?

263
00:17:22,403 --> 00:17:24,697
lt's some writer
l must've brushed off.

264
00:17:24,781 --> 00:17:27,992
Get something to eat.
There's lovely stuff over there.

265
00:17:28,075 --> 00:17:30,244
We will in a few minutes.

266
00:17:30,328 --> 00:17:32,038
Your hands are as cold as mine.

267
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:34,874
Would you like one of these?

268
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,084
l don't think l do.

269
00:17:37,168 --> 00:17:39,879
Are you talking about threats?

270
00:17:39,962 --> 00:17:42,548
No. Yes.

271
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,968
l don't know.
He's pissed off.

272
00:17:46,052 --> 00:17:50,389
l thought writers were your long suit.
You're the writer's executive.

273
00:17:50,473 --> 00:17:52,725
Are you pitching me a dream?

274
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:57,271
- You don't sound sincerely interested.
- lt depends how good the dream is.

275
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:00,566
Levy's here.

276
00:18:03,945 --> 00:18:08,783
- Dick, what's he doing here?
- Goldblum? He's a friend.

277
00:18:08,866 --> 00:18:11,744
- No, Larry Levy.
- He came with Sally.

278
00:18:11,828 --> 00:18:14,080
What's going on with my job?

279
00:18:14,122 --> 00:18:17,416
Everywhere l look,
Larry Levy is in my face.

280
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:21,254
Larry Levy is a comer. That's what
comers do, they get in your face.

281
00:18:21,295 --> 00:18:24,257
You're a comer, too. You can handle it.
Stop worrying about him.

282
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:26,425
So the rumors are true?

283
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:28,427
Rumors are always true.

284
00:18:28,511 --> 00:18:33,015
-l'm always the last to hear about them.
-You're the last one to believe.

285
00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:34,892
Am l out?

286
00:18:34,976 --> 00:18:37,979
You're not out, but you'd better
start thinking about a roommate.

287
00:18:38,062 --> 00:18:41,441
Relax, you can handle this.
You can make it work for you.

288
00:18:41,524 --> 00:18:45,319
- Larry?
- Dick. Sorry to crash your party.

289
00:18:45,403 --> 00:18:49,115
- Do you know everybody?
- l will before the night's out.

290
00:18:49,157 --> 00:18:51,200
You will, indeed.

291
00:18:54,036 --> 00:18:57,707
- Great party, Dick.
- Good. Did you get some food?

292
00:19:02,587 --> 00:19:04,589
Listen to this.

293
00:19:04,672 --> 00:19:07,467
'He lifts her dress.
She kisses him harder.

294
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:11,345
He puts his hands in her underpants.
She grabs his shoulders.

295
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:16,184
He pulls her dress above her waist.
He rubs against her wide, soft belly.

296
00:19:16,267 --> 00:19:20,813
Slowly he pushes her panties down
to her knees. She's faint with passion.

297
00:19:20,897 --> 00:19:24,108
She arches her back and
he lowers her down onto the buckboard.

298
00:19:24,192 --> 00:19:28,654
The horses snort and whinny.
They, too, feel her passion.

299
00:19:28,738 --> 00:19:31,491
The camera moves in
on the nostrils of the horse...

300
00:19:31,532 --> 00:19:34,869
as the buckboard begins to shake.(

301
00:19:34,952 --> 00:19:38,790
God! Do you believe that?
Steve recommended that script.

302
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:42,668
He says they're hot for it at Universal.
They're gonna have a bidding war.

303
00:19:42,752 --> 00:19:46,297
l heard a pitch today. lt wasn't bad.
Stuck on a story point, though.

304
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,010
- l'm a story editor. Go.
- New York City, big advertising agency.

305
00:19:51,093 --> 00:19:54,222
An account executive makes
a presentation to a potential client.

306
00:19:54,305 --> 00:19:56,766
The client promises
to get back to him.

307
00:19:56,849 --> 00:19:59,352
- Does it have to be advertising?
- That's not the problem.

308
00:19:59,435 --> 00:20:03,272
The account executive keeps waiting
for the client to call him back...

309
00:20:03,356 --> 00:20:06,859
to tell him what he thought
of the idea, if he got the job or not.

310
00:20:06,943 --> 00:20:09,362
But the client never calls.

311
00:20:09,403 --> 00:20:14,283
The account executive gets so pissed off
and frustrated, he becomes obsessive.

312
00:20:14,367 --> 00:20:17,787
- He decides to drive the client crazy.
- What does he do?

313
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:22,375
Sends him threatening postcards.
lt's not important.

314
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:26,420
Here's the problem.
How long do you think...

315
00:20:26,462 --> 00:20:29,966
the account executive
harasses the client...

316
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:32,385
before he becomes dangerous?

317
00:20:32,426 --> 00:20:35,471
- Does it have to be advertising?
- How long?

318
00:20:35,555 --> 00:20:38,015
lf it were me--

319
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:39,809
One month?

320
00:20:39,892 --> 00:20:42,562
Three months.
No, more. Five months.

321
00:20:42,603 --> 00:20:45,440
- To be dangerous, five months.
- That's what l thought.

322
00:20:45,523 --> 00:20:47,692
- Who's the writer?
- l don't know.

323
00:20:47,775 --> 00:20:50,403
You don't know the writer
who pitched you the idea?

324
00:20:50,445 --> 00:20:53,990
l don't know his name.
lt's a couple kids.

325
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,909
TV writers.

326
00:20:58,411 --> 00:21:02,373
Can we go to bed now?
l'm starting to wrinkle.

327
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,757
- See you tomorrow afternoon.
- Absolutely.

328
00:21:11,841 --> 00:21:14,719
Burt, Larry Levy. l hope you don't
remember me, and if you do...

329
00:21:14,802 --> 00:21:19,098
l hope there are no hard feelings,
l was working for Gassner then.

330
00:21:24,187 --> 00:21:26,230
Take care.

331
00:21:26,314 --> 00:21:29,066
- Who was that?
- An exec over at Fox.

332
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,235
Was until breakfast, anyway.

333
00:21:39,702 --> 00:21:42,455
- Good morning, Mr. Mill.
- Hi, Susan. How are you?

334
00:21:42,497 --> 00:21:45,124
l'm with Joel.

335
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,294
- Hi, Burt. Griffin Mill.
- Good to see you.

336
00:21:48,377 --> 00:21:50,630
Hi, Charles. How are you?

337
00:21:50,713 --> 00:21:53,216
- Asshole.
- One of a breed.

338
00:21:55,343 --> 00:21:59,764
Actually, he's not. There's a whole
breed of them. They're breeding them.

339
00:21:59,847 --> 00:22:02,725
Joel, you're losing your touch,
scheduling meetings so close together.

340
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:05,269
That guy didn't have time
to finish his breakfast.

341
00:22:05,353 --> 00:22:07,730
He'd already eaten.
Gets up early.

342
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,276
- You went to Mellen's last night.
- Take this away, please. Yes, l did.

343
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,072
- How is he?
- l'd like a Vitelle water.

344
00:22:16,155 --> 00:22:18,157
He's fine.

345
00:22:18,241 --> 00:22:20,493
You left early. Why?

346
00:22:20,535 --> 00:22:24,372
We had to work
on the museum party.

347
00:22:24,455 --> 00:22:27,250
l will not work for Larry Levy.

348
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,669
l'm not asking you to.

349
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,257
l report to you. lf l have to report
to Larry Levy, l quit.

350
00:22:36,592 --> 00:22:40,096
You can't quit.
l won't let you quit.

351
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:42,849
You have a year and a half on your
contract. l'll sue you for breach...

352
00:22:42,932 --> 00:22:46,269
if you don't show up in the office
every day, with a smile.

353
00:22:47,603 --> 00:22:49,856
Why Levy?

354
00:22:49,939 --> 00:22:52,358
Levy was available.

355
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,861
He's good on material,
you're good with writers.

356
00:22:54,902 --> 00:22:57,530
We're a team. He's a new member
of the team, that's all.

357
00:22:58,698 --> 00:23:00,867
He can make us all look good.

358
00:23:00,908 --> 00:23:03,911
This is a wine glass. Can l have
my water in a water glass, please?

359
00:23:05,246 --> 00:23:06,747
Well?

360
00:23:06,831 --> 00:23:09,876
l'll have to think about it.

361
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:11,878
l want an answer this afternoon.

362
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,630
l have to go out to Palmdale.

363
00:23:14,714 --> 00:23:17,633
The director of Lonely Room
is giving Lily a hard time.

364
00:23:18,926 --> 00:23:22,638
- l'll be back around 5:00.
- So call after 5:00.

365
00:23:22,722 --> 00:23:25,057
l'll get back to you.

366
00:23:25,141 --> 00:23:29,187
...you haven't died.
See, he's still hanging on.

367
00:23:41,783 --> 00:23:45,077
Griffin, Joel Levison on line 2.
l'll put it through.

368
00:23:45,161 --> 00:23:47,914
- l'll get back to him.
- Tell Joel you'll get back to him?

369
00:23:47,955 --> 00:23:51,542
Yeah. l want to hear
what he's got to say.

370
00:24:01,177 --> 00:24:04,305
- How did this get here?
- The mail.

371
00:24:04,388 --> 00:24:07,266
But this does not have a postmark.
This was hand-delivered.

372
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,393
Not to me.
lt came with the mail.

373
00:24:09,477 --> 00:24:10,937
Jimmy?

374
00:24:13,397 --> 00:24:16,442
Do you know anything about this?
Who delivered it? Where it came from?

375
00:24:16,526 --> 00:24:18,903
Mail room?

376
00:24:18,986 --> 00:24:21,656
But l want to know how it got
to the goddamn mail room.

377
00:24:21,739 --> 00:24:24,450
- Find out and get back to me.
- Okay, sure.

378
00:24:24,492 --> 00:24:28,329
- You go with him.
- You want me to go to the mail room?

379
00:24:28,412 --> 00:24:30,623
l want you to go to the mail room.
And while you're there...

380
00:24:30,665 --> 00:24:34,085
l would like a copy of
The Lonely Room rewrites...

381
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:36,838
in white pages,
no color.

382
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:39,423
- Find out how this got in my mail.
- Yes, sir.

383
00:24:39,507 --> 00:24:43,469
- You'll get your own phones?
- l can get my own phones.

384
00:24:50,184 --> 00:24:52,353
Son of a bitch!
Five months.

385
00:24:52,437 --> 00:24:55,857
One, two, three, four, five.

386
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,612
Richard Fueller.
David Lucas.

387
00:25:04,907 --> 00:25:08,828
Cal Winstrom. David Kahane.
Sammy Tettleton.

388
00:25:14,709 --> 00:25:16,169
lncoming.

389
00:25:19,922 --> 00:25:23,426
lncoming. Unreturned calls.

390
00:25:23,509 --> 00:25:25,052
Bill Lyndstrom.

391
00:25:26,304 --> 00:25:28,681
Nancy Franklin.
Wouldn't be a woman.

392
00:25:28,764 --> 00:25:30,683
David Kahane.

393
00:25:43,404 --> 00:25:45,031
Lyndstrom.

394
00:25:47,241 --> 00:25:49,660
Strategic Planning.
Wouldn't be him.

395
00:25:49,744 --> 00:25:53,206
What was that other guy's name?

396
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:54,707
Kahane.

397
00:25:57,001 --> 00:26:00,713
Kaltrime. Kahane.

398
00:26:00,797 --> 00:26:02,757
'Unproduced.'
Gotcha!

399
00:27:00,231 --> 00:27:03,401
- Hello.
- Hello. ls David Kahane there?

400
00:27:03,443 --> 00:27:04,902
David!

401
00:27:12,785 --> 00:27:16,747
l'm sorry. l forgot.
He's gone out. Who's this?

402
00:27:16,831 --> 00:27:19,876
- This is Griffin Mill.
- Oh, the dead man.

403
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:23,504
- What did you say?
- Oh, nothing.

404
00:27:23,588 --> 00:27:29,218
- About me being a dead man?
- Just a nickname David has for you.

405
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:33,055
l see.
That's a funny nickname.

406
00:27:33,097 --> 00:27:37,059
l suppose your husband doesn't like me
very much.

407
00:27:37,101 --> 00:27:39,312
l don't have a husband.

408
00:27:39,395 --> 00:27:41,522
l suppose David doesn't like me
very much.

409
00:27:41,606 --> 00:27:43,816
David's gone to the cinema.

410
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:48,112
- When will he be back?
- When the film's over, l presume.

411
00:27:48,196 --> 00:27:50,907
And you are?

412
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:53,701
- June.
- June?

413
00:27:53,785 --> 00:27:56,037
Here we go.
You want to know my last name.

414
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,041
- No one can pronounce it.
- Try me.

415
00:28:00,124 --> 00:28:01,584
Gudmundsdottir.

416
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:03,419
Gudmundsdottir.

417
00:28:06,756 --> 00:28:09,425
- How's that?
- Very good.

418
00:28:09,467 --> 00:28:10,927
Thanks.

419
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,015
- What do people usually say?
- Don't ask.

420
00:28:16,098 --> 00:28:21,145
Anything from Good Dog's Water
to Goulash Wallop.

421
00:28:23,064 --> 00:28:25,399
- You English?
- Yep.

422
00:28:25,483 --> 00:28:27,819
Well, no, not really.

423
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,738
Where are you sort of not from?

424
00:28:30,822 --> 00:28:34,784
Do you want the long story
or the short one?

425
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:36,994
- The long one.
- No, you'd never believe it.

426
00:28:37,036 --> 00:28:40,998
- The short one's lceland.
- lceland?

427
00:28:41,082 --> 00:28:44,585
l didn't know anyone came from lceland.
l thought it was just a block of ice.

428
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:47,004
lt's very green, actually.

429
00:28:47,088 --> 00:28:49,757
Really? l thought that was Greenland.

430
00:28:49,841 --> 00:28:54,428
No, Greenland's very icy.
lceland's very green.

431
00:28:54,512 --> 00:28:57,974
They switched names to fool the Vikings
who tried to steal their women.

432
00:28:58,057 --> 00:28:59,475
l see.

433
00:28:59,517 --> 00:29:02,478
No. Blue sea.

434
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,522
Red sea.

435
00:29:04,564 --> 00:29:07,817
- No red.
- You're a painter.

436
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,861
How did you guess?

437
00:29:11,446 --> 00:29:13,906
What movie did David go to see?

438
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:17,869
He went to the Rialto in Pasadena.
He always goes there.

439
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,871
What's showing?

440
00:29:19,912 --> 00:29:23,916
Bicycle Thief, l think.

441
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,419
lt's a good movie.
Have you seen it?

442
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,964
l don't go to the movies.

443
00:29:30,047 --> 00:29:31,466
Why not?

444
00:29:39,348 --> 00:29:41,684
Life is too short.

445
00:29:41,726 --> 00:29:44,270
l've got to hang up now.

446
00:31:09,355 --> 00:31:11,315
David Kahane!

447
00:31:11,357 --> 00:31:13,943
You have the wrong guy, man.

448
00:31:35,006 --> 00:31:37,800
David Kahane.
Griffin Mill.

449
00:31:39,385 --> 00:31:41,554
Griffin Mill.

450
00:31:41,637 --> 00:31:43,139
Yeah?

451
00:31:43,222 --> 00:31:45,433
Great movie, huh?

452
00:31:45,516 --> 00:31:49,395
lt's refreshing to see something like
this after all these cop movies...

453
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:53,983
and, you know,
things we do.

454
00:31:54,066 --> 00:31:57,153
- Maybe we'll do a remake of this.
- You'd probably give it a happy ending.

455
00:31:57,236 --> 00:31:59,238
No, we'd keep it pure.

456
00:31:59,322 --> 00:32:01,240
Pure, right.

457
00:32:01,324 --> 00:32:04,827
- You want to write it?
- Don't fuck with me.

458
00:32:04,911 --> 00:32:07,497
l'm not fucking with you.
Didn't l say l'd get back to you?

459
00:32:07,538 --> 00:32:11,042
Yeah, about six months ago.
l thought you'd forgotten.

460
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:13,836
You were angry.

461
00:32:13,878 --> 00:32:15,338
Maybe.

462
00:32:15,379 --> 00:32:17,715
Do you want to talk about it?

463
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:20,343
- Okay, sure.
- Great.

464
00:32:20,384 --> 00:32:23,679
Let's let the studio
buy us a drink.

465
00:32:26,057 --> 00:32:30,061
lf you don't mind a place where you
don't have any suck with the maitre d'.

466
00:32:30,144 --> 00:32:32,730
- l know a bar down the street.
- Let's go.

467
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:42,865
Have you ever been to Japan?

468
00:32:42,907 --> 00:32:47,120
Yes. l was there once on
a location scout with Steven Spielberg.

469
00:32:47,203 --> 00:32:49,622
l lived there for a year.

470
00:32:49,705 --> 00:32:51,874
Student year abroad.

471
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:54,752
l wish l'd done that.

472
00:32:54,836 --> 00:32:58,172
l think about it a lot.
l'll never forget it.

473
00:32:58,256 --> 00:33:00,758
You should write about it.

474
00:33:00,842 --> 00:33:03,386
l did.
Don't you remember?

475
00:33:04,595 --> 00:33:06,055
What?

476
00:33:08,349 --> 00:33:13,479
My idea about the American student
who goes to Japan.

477
00:33:13,563 --> 00:33:16,732
That was my pitch, the one you were
supposed to get back to me on.

478
00:33:16,774 --> 00:33:19,652
- You don't remember, do you?
- Of course l remember.

479
00:33:22,113 --> 00:33:24,740
You never got back to me.

480
00:33:24,782 --> 00:33:26,868
Listen.

481
00:33:26,951 --> 00:33:32,081
l was an asshole, all right?
lt comes with the job.

482
00:33:32,123 --> 00:33:34,250
l'm really sorry.

483
00:33:36,544 --> 00:33:39,755
l know how angry you must've been.
l'll make it up to you.

484
00:33:39,797 --> 00:33:41,424
That's why l'm here.

485
00:33:41,466 --> 00:33:45,011
l'm gonna give you a deal, David.

486
00:33:45,094 --> 00:33:48,806
l won't guarantee you l'll make
the movie, but l will give you a shot.

487
00:33:52,643 --> 00:33:57,482
Let's just stop all the postcard shit,
all right?

488
00:33:57,565 --> 00:34:00,359
l'm here to say
that l would like...

489
00:34:00,443 --> 00:34:02,361
to start over.

490
00:34:03,988 --> 00:34:05,448
Friends.

491
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,952
Fuck you, man.
You're a liar.

492
00:34:09,994 --> 00:34:11,996
You're stepping over the line.

493
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,332
You didn't come here
to see The Bicycle Thief.

494
00:34:14,373 --> 00:34:17,502
You came in five minutes
before the picture ended.

495
00:34:17,585 --> 00:34:20,004
Nearly tripped over my feet.

496
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,341
Did you call my house?

497
00:34:25,301 --> 00:34:27,178
Speak to the lce Queen?

498
00:34:28,888 --> 00:34:32,183
You'd like her.
She's a lot like you.

499
00:34:32,225 --> 00:34:33,684
All heart.

500
00:34:39,816 --> 00:34:44,028
You're on my list, pal.
Nothing's gonna change that.

501
00:34:47,865 --> 00:34:51,494
See you in the next reel, asshole.

502
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:43,296
lt's a nice boat you got there,
movie exec.

503
00:35:43,379 --> 00:35:46,674
lt's me, the writer.
Still want to buy my story?

504
00:35:46,757 --> 00:35:50,261
l told you l'd deal. Stop by the studio.
We'll work something out.

505
00:35:50,344 --> 00:35:53,264
And who will l ask for?

506
00:35:53,306 --> 00:35:54,765
Larry Levy?

507
00:35:56,768 --> 00:35:58,728
What's Larry Levy got to do with this?

508
00:35:59,812 --> 00:36:02,106
- How do you know about Larry Levy?
- Don't you read the trades?

509
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:05,401
New York Times business section?
He's movin' in, you're movin' out.

510
00:36:05,485 --> 00:36:08,196
You can't make a deal, they say.
Yesterday's news.

511
00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:10,198
Wait a minute.

512
00:36:11,657 --> 00:36:14,118
Can l borrow your mobile phone?

513
00:36:14,202 --> 00:36:17,789
Larry Levy.
Larry, David Kahane here.

514
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:21,793
Guess who's making promises
about getting pictures made...

515
00:36:21,834 --> 00:36:24,462
to writers in parking lots?

516
00:36:24,504 --> 00:36:27,548
Guess what dumb
son of a bitch executive...

517
00:36:27,632 --> 00:36:31,719
is trying to take advantage of me?

518
00:36:31,803 --> 00:36:35,556
Do you realize how unstoppable
this guy is?

519
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,975
You know,
l cannot wait...

520
00:36:38,017 --> 00:36:43,064
to tell the world that when Griffin Mill
can't cut the pressure at work...

521
00:36:43,147 --> 00:36:46,150
he drives out to Pasadena...

522
00:36:46,234 --> 00:36:49,153
to pick fights with writers.

523
00:36:50,488 --> 00:36:52,490
Tell Larry Levy to call me.

524
00:36:52,573 --> 00:36:58,037
The word is out that he's going to start
making meaningful pictures for a change.

525
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,249
Let's forget this.
Just stop all the postcard shit!

526
00:37:01,332 --> 00:37:03,543
l don't write postcards!
l write scripts!

527
00:37:03,626 --> 00:37:06,838
- We're both wrong.
- No, you're wrong, buddy!

528
00:37:06,921 --> 00:37:09,590
You're in over your head.
That's why you're losing your job.

529
00:37:09,674 --> 00:37:11,801
Then what are you gonna do?

530
00:37:12,927 --> 00:37:15,304
l can write.
What can you do?

531
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:22,311
l said, let's forget this.

532
00:37:27,066 --> 00:37:29,026
Ah, shit.

533
00:37:31,154 --> 00:37:33,364
Mill, you okay?

534
00:37:41,789 --> 00:37:44,625
Keep it to yourself!

535
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:47,295
Keep it to yourself!

536
00:38:12,945 --> 00:38:14,405
Kahane?

537
00:39:35,528 --> 00:39:39,323
That's interesting.
Who's writing this movie?

538
00:39:39,365 --> 00:39:42,910
Who wrote the new ending
to Fatal Attraction? The audience.

539
00:39:42,994 --> 00:39:45,955
A million screenwriters
from the audience wrote that.

540
00:39:46,038 --> 00:39:49,876
Who's to say what it would have done
if you had left the original ending?

541
00:39:49,959 --> 00:39:53,880
You're right, but you can say that it's
done almost 300 million worldwide...

542
00:39:53,921 --> 00:39:56,257
with the new ending.

543
00:39:56,382 --> 00:40:00,011
Larry Levy, l don't believe you've met
my assistant, Whitney Gersh.

544
00:40:00,094 --> 00:40:02,680
- No, l haven't.
- lt's a pleasure to meet you.

545
00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:07,518
How's your picture?
lt just tested last week.

546
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,189
lt's doing well.
lt was our first test.

547
00:40:11,272 --> 00:40:13,191
Excuse me, Walter.

548
00:40:13,232 --> 00:40:17,653
Joel, Griffin isn't in, but l think
we really have to start this meeting.

549
00:40:17,737 --> 00:40:19,989
Okay, Celia. Thank you.

550
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,911
Remember a movie called D.O.A.?

551
00:40:24,994 --> 00:40:27,205
Sure l do.
Eddie O'Brien and Pam Britton.

552
00:40:27,246 --> 00:40:30,750
Disney did a remake in '87 or '88.

553
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:33,669
l think we've got
pretty much the same situation here.

554
00:40:33,753 --> 00:40:36,214
Keep our noses clean, Walter.

555
00:40:39,675 --> 00:40:42,178
lt's a shame to waste a picture.

556
00:40:42,261 --> 00:40:46,474
Who said we're wasting the picture?
Where did that come from?

557
00:40:46,557 --> 00:40:49,352
You know what's interesting?
We're all too busy--

558
00:40:49,435 --> 00:40:54,273
Griffin, you're really late.
They're waiting inside.

559
00:40:54,357 --> 00:40:57,777
To actually rub shoulders
with the great unwashed?

560
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:01,114
We need to give them
the kind of pictures they want...

561
00:41:01,197 --> 00:41:03,324
not the kind
writers want to give them.

562
00:41:10,665 --> 00:41:13,668
- Hello. Sorry l'm late.
- You certainly are.

563
00:41:17,672 --> 00:41:19,924
A few minutes in the office
would be fine.

564
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,219
Griffin, you missed
the formal welcoming ceremony.

565
00:41:23,302 --> 00:41:26,264
You know Larry Levy.

566
00:41:26,347 --> 00:41:28,391
Of course. Hi, Larry.

567
00:41:29,809 --> 00:41:31,227
Hi, Griffin.

568
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:33,229
Larry was able to leave Fox
a week earlier than he thought...

569
00:41:33,312 --> 00:41:35,440
and has come aboard
as of this morning.

570
00:41:35,481 --> 00:41:40,570
- Great. Let's start.
- Larry was in the middle of something.

571
00:41:40,653 --> 00:41:44,240
No, l wasn't. l was just killing time
waiting for Griffin.

572
00:41:44,323 --> 00:41:47,326
No, finish.
What were you saying?

573
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:51,831
l was saying l've yet to meet a writer
who could change water into wine...

574
00:41:51,914 --> 00:41:54,417
and we have a tendency
to treat them like that.

575
00:41:55,501 --> 00:41:57,753
Not at this studio.

576
00:41:57,837 --> 00:42:01,757
A million and a half of these scripts.
lt's nuts.

577
00:42:01,841 --> 00:42:04,135
And l think avoidable.

578
00:42:04,218 --> 00:42:08,222
Let me ask you. When was the last time
you bought a ticket to see a movie?

579
00:42:08,306 --> 00:42:12,226
- You actually paid your own money?
- Last night.

580
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:14,479
Pasadena. The Bicycle Thief.

581
00:42:14,562 --> 00:42:17,774
- You saw The Bicycle Thief?
- l love that. lt's a great film.

582
00:42:17,857 --> 00:42:20,651
lt's an art movie. lt doesn't count.
We're talking about movie movies.

583
00:42:20,693 --> 00:42:22,653
Jesus, people.

584
00:42:22,695 --> 00:42:25,615
l'm just saying there's time
and money to be saved...

585
00:42:25,698 --> 00:42:28,409
if we came up with these stories
on our own.

586
00:42:28,493 --> 00:42:31,496
- Where are these stories coming from?
- Anywhere. lt doesn't matter.

587
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,958
The newspaper.
Pick any story.

588
00:42:39,212 --> 00:42:42,256
'lmmigrants protest budget cuts
in literacy program.'

589
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,802
Human spirit overcoming human adversity.
Sounds like Horatio Alger in the barrio.

590
00:42:45,885 --> 00:42:48,846
Put Jimmy Smits in it and you've got
a sexy Stand and Deliver.

591
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:52,308
- Next. Come on.
- This isn't my field.

592
00:42:52,391 --> 00:42:55,103
lt doesn't matter. Give it a shot.
You can't lose here.

593
00:42:58,106 --> 00:43:02,401
How about 'Mud slide kills 60
in slums of Chili'?

594
00:43:02,485 --> 00:43:05,863
That's good. Triumph over tragedy.
Sounds like a John Boorman picture.

595
00:43:05,947 --> 00:43:09,200
Slap a happy ending on it,
the script will write itself.

596
00:43:09,242 --> 00:43:12,870
- Bonnie. Give me the paper.
- l don't know, Larry.

597
00:43:12,912 --> 00:43:14,872
Give it a shot.

598
00:43:16,582 --> 00:43:19,961
'Further bond losses
push Dow down 7.15.'

599
00:43:20,878 --> 00:43:23,631
- l see Connery as Bond.
- That's funny.

600
00:43:23,714 --> 00:43:27,385
lt's a good thing Oliver Stone wasn't
listening to you. Where would we be?

601
00:43:27,426 --> 00:43:31,722
We would have been spared
sitting through Wall Street.

602
00:43:31,764 --> 00:43:35,435
- What did Wall Street do worldwide?
- 70, 75, maybe 80.

603
00:43:35,518 --> 00:43:38,729
$80 million,
a couple Oscars.

604
00:43:38,813 --> 00:43:42,859
l think Larry's point is well taken.
Let's move on.

605
00:43:42,942 --> 00:43:46,404
Can you give us an update
on the Taylor-Hackford project?

606
00:43:46,487 --> 00:43:48,489
Griffin?

607
00:43:48,573 --> 00:43:49,991
Yeah.

608
00:43:51,284 --> 00:43:53,828
l was thinking what
an interesting concept it is...

609
00:43:53,911 --> 00:43:58,207
to eliminate the writer
from the artistic process.

610
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:04,046
lf we can get rid of the actors and
directors, maybe we've got something.

611
00:44:09,469 --> 00:44:10,887
Hello, Walter.

612
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:13,264
Make yourself at home.

613
00:44:13,347 --> 00:44:17,059
Mr. Mill, l understand you were late
coming in this morning.

614
00:44:17,143 --> 00:44:19,395
You all right?

615
00:44:19,437 --> 00:44:21,063
l'm fine.

616
00:44:21,147 --> 00:44:23,274
l appreciate your concern.

617
00:44:24,692 --> 00:44:27,069
What can l do for you?

618
00:44:27,153 --> 00:44:30,865
Don't tell me you came here
to pitch me a story?

619
00:44:30,907 --> 00:44:33,326
That's exactly what l've come to do.

620
00:44:33,409 --> 00:44:36,454
lt's a good one, too.
lt's about a writer, sort of.

621
00:44:36,537 --> 00:44:37,955
David Kahane.

622
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:43,252
Who's David Kahane?

623
00:44:43,294 --> 00:44:46,881
- You met him.
- l meet a lot of writers.

624
00:44:46,964 --> 00:44:52,553
But this writer was murdered last night
in back of the Rialto Theater.

625
00:44:52,595 --> 00:44:54,096
Murdered?

626
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:58,226
Come to think of it, Pasadena's
as good a place to die as any.

627
00:44:59,602 --> 00:45:01,562
What's the story?

628
00:45:01,604 --> 00:45:05,691
ln 25 words or less?
Okay.

629
00:45:05,775 --> 00:45:08,611
Movie exec calls writer.
Girlfriend says he's at the movies.

630
00:45:08,653 --> 00:45:11,989
Exec goes to movies, meets writer,
drinks with writer.

631
00:45:12,073 --> 00:45:15,618
Writer gets conked and dies
in 4 inches of dirty water.

632
00:45:15,701 --> 00:45:17,995
Movie exec is in deep shit.

633
00:45:19,122 --> 00:45:21,124
What do you think?

634
00:45:21,165 --> 00:45:24,669
That's more than 25 words.
And it's bullshit.

635
00:45:24,752 --> 00:45:28,631
Pasadena homicide doesn't think so.
They've got a complete report.

636
00:45:29,674 --> 00:45:33,970
You met Kahane at the Rialto,
got drunk with him. He left before you.

637
00:45:34,011 --> 00:45:37,306
That's the last time anyone
saw him alive, except you, maybe.

638
00:45:38,516 --> 00:45:41,352
Why are you denying this?

639
00:45:41,436 --> 00:45:44,814
Well, what do the police think?

640
00:45:44,897 --> 00:45:47,650
They think it's a botched robbery.

641
00:45:49,485 --> 00:45:54,449
The window of his car was busted.
He surprised someone taking the radio.

642
00:45:54,532 --> 00:45:56,826
There was a fight, he was killed.

643
00:45:56,868 --> 00:45:59,829
l didn't kill him, Walter.

644
00:45:59,912 --> 00:46:04,459
But l went to see him.
l know l said l didn't, but l did.

645
00:46:04,542 --> 00:46:06,627
Why'd you lie to me?

646
00:46:08,504 --> 00:46:10,840
Now's not a very good time for me.

647
00:46:10,923 --> 00:46:14,469
Haven't you heard the rumors?
l'm on my way out.

648
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:17,013
Just what l need,
a little more controversy.

649
00:46:17,096 --> 00:46:19,015
lt's not a good time.

650
00:46:20,433 --> 00:46:22,727
Look.

651
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:26,397
l'm in charge of studio security
in every definition of the word.

652
00:46:26,481 --> 00:46:32,028
Which means it is my job to take care
of a studio executive should he be...

653
00:46:32,111 --> 00:46:35,364
under suspicion of murder
at a time when profits are down...

654
00:46:35,448 --> 00:46:37,867
and the company is vulnerable
for a takeover.

655
00:46:37,909 --> 00:46:41,078
lt is my job to keep this
very, very quiet!

656
00:46:42,497 --> 00:46:44,582
Do you want to help?

657
00:46:44,665 --> 00:46:47,543
- Of course.
- Then stop lying.

658
00:46:47,585 --> 00:46:50,171
- How many times did you meet with him?
- Once.

659
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,925
- Not counting last night.
- Not counting last night.

660
00:46:54,008 --> 00:46:56,260
Why'd you go all the way to Pasadena
to meet him?

661
00:46:56,344 --> 00:46:59,263
He had an idea l was interested in.
l wanted to talk to him right away.

662
00:46:59,347 --> 00:47:04,143
Was his girlfriend a friend, too?
Think fast.

663
00:47:04,227 --> 00:47:06,854
Jesus Christ, Walter.
What is this?

664
00:47:06,896 --> 00:47:10,066
The third degree. Wait until the police
start asking questions.

665
00:47:10,149 --> 00:47:13,611
l'll go to the police now.
You come with me.

666
00:47:13,694 --> 00:47:16,030
You're acting like someone
who's guilty.

667
00:47:16,072 --> 00:47:18,074
You're not guilty, are you?

668
00:47:18,116 --> 00:47:20,368
l'm not a murderer.

669
00:47:37,593 --> 00:47:39,595
Bad news?

670
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:41,097
What?

671
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:44,100
The fax.
ls it bad news?

672
00:47:46,561 --> 00:47:48,146
Business as usual.

673
00:47:49,814 --> 00:47:53,609
The Hollywood system
did not murder David Kahane.

674
00:47:53,651 --> 00:47:56,821
Not the $98 million movie,
not the $12 million actor.

675
00:47:56,904 --> 00:48:02,535
Not even the million dollar deal
that David Kahane never landed.

676
00:48:02,618 --> 00:48:05,705
The most that we can pin on Hollywood...

677
00:48:05,788 --> 00:48:09,250
is assault with intent to kill.

678
00:48:09,292 --> 00:48:14,130
Because society is responsible
for this particular murder.

679
00:48:14,172 --> 00:48:16,299
lt is to society we must look...

680
00:48:16,382 --> 00:48:20,136
if we are to have justice
for that crime.

681
00:48:20,178 --> 00:48:22,930
Because someone in the night...

682
00:48:22,972 --> 00:48:25,183
killed David Kahane.

683
00:48:25,266 --> 00:48:27,685
And that person
will have to bear the guilt.

684
00:48:29,228 --> 00:48:31,647
And if David were here now...

685
00:48:31,689 --> 00:48:34,233
l know in my heart
that he would say...

686
00:48:35,651 --> 00:48:38,571
'Cut the shit, Phil.

687
00:48:38,654 --> 00:48:42,617
What did you learn from this?
Did you learn anything from this?(

688
00:48:42,658 --> 00:48:45,787
And l'd say, 'Yeah, David,
l've learned a lot.

689
00:48:45,828 --> 00:48:48,790
We here will take it from here.

690
00:48:48,831 --> 00:48:53,169
And the next time we sell a script
for a million dollars...

691
00:48:53,211 --> 00:48:56,547
and nail some shit-bag producer
to the wall, we'll say...

692
00:48:56,631 --> 00:48:59,091
That's another one for David Kahane.(

693
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,599
David was working on something the day
he died. l'd like to share it with you.

694
00:49:07,975 --> 00:49:10,978
'Blackness.
A mangy dog barks.

695
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:14,357
Garbage can lids are lifted
as derelicts in the street...

696
00:49:14,398 --> 00:49:16,859
hunt for food.

697
00:49:16,943 --> 00:49:19,362
Buzzing, as a cheap alarm clock
goes off.

698
00:49:19,445 --> 00:49:23,157
lnterior. Flophouse room.
Early morning.

699
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:26,327
A tracking shot moves
through the grimy room.

700
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:29,997
Light streams in through holes
in yellowing window shades.

701
00:49:30,081 --> 00:49:32,750
Moths dance
in the beams of light.

702
00:49:32,834 --> 00:49:36,170
Track down along the floor.
The frayed rug.

703
00:49:36,212 --> 00:49:39,173
Stop on an old shoe.

704
00:49:39,215 --> 00:49:40,925
lt's empty.(

705
00:49:45,179 --> 00:49:47,265
That's as far as he got.

706
00:49:48,641 --> 00:49:51,102
That's the last thing he wrote.

707
00:49:51,978 --> 00:49:54,188
So long, Dave.

708
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:56,441
Fade out.

709
00:49:56,524 --> 00:49:57,942
Thank you.

710
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,752
Who are you?
You're not a writer.

711
00:50:18,504 --> 00:50:20,840
No, l'm Griffin Mill.

712
00:50:20,923 --> 00:50:22,842
We spoke the night David--

713
00:50:22,925 --> 00:50:25,761
Blue sea, white sea.
Yes.

714
00:50:25,803 --> 00:50:28,097
- lt turned out you were right.
- What?

715
00:50:28,181 --> 00:50:30,600
lt was a red sea.

716
00:50:30,683 --> 00:50:32,435
Oh, yeah.

717
00:50:34,896 --> 00:50:38,065
You're the only person l know here.

718
00:50:38,107 --> 00:50:40,985
l'm really sorry about David.

719
00:50:41,068 --> 00:50:44,155
He was a talent.

720
00:50:45,323 --> 00:50:47,533
You really think so?

721
00:50:47,617 --> 00:50:50,870
l always suspected he was...

722
00:50:50,953 --> 00:50:53,581
uniquely untalented.

723
00:50:55,124 --> 00:50:58,294
lt's nice of you to say that. lt was
nice of you to come. You didn't have to.

724
00:50:58,377 --> 00:50:59,796
l did.

725
00:50:59,879 --> 00:51:04,425
You know, l was probably the last person
to see him alive.

726
00:51:04,467 --> 00:51:06,803
The police told me.

727
00:51:06,844 --> 00:51:08,971
Not quite the last, surely.

728
00:51:12,141 --> 00:51:15,353
l'm sure this is a terrible time
for you.

729
00:51:15,436 --> 00:51:17,772
ls there anything you need?

730
00:51:17,814 --> 00:51:22,527
No, really.
l don't feel bad.

731
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:25,488
lt's like when my parents died.

732
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:29,075
l didn't feel anything at all.
They were just gone.

733
00:51:30,785 --> 00:51:33,996
l'm sure it hasn't sunk in yet.

734
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,832
That was years ago.

735
00:51:35,873 --> 00:51:38,668
No, l meant David.

736
00:51:38,709 --> 00:51:40,586
Oh, God.

737
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:43,673
These people.
l don't like it here.

738
00:51:43,756 --> 00:51:47,343
They're all expecting me
to grieve and mourn.

739
00:51:47,426 --> 00:51:49,720
l can't talk to them.

740
00:51:51,472 --> 00:51:56,602
David's gone and
l'm somewhere else already.

741
00:51:56,686 --> 00:51:59,522
- Will you take me home?
- What?

742
00:51:59,564 --> 00:52:02,316
Will you take me home?

743
00:52:02,358 --> 00:52:05,153
Sure. l'm right here.

744
00:52:42,148 --> 00:52:44,776
These are very interesting.
l like them.

745
00:52:44,859 --> 00:52:48,488
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks.

746
00:52:48,571 --> 00:52:52,492
Where do you show?
What gallery? Who's your dealer?

747
00:52:52,575 --> 00:52:54,994
l don't have a dealer.

748
00:52:55,077 --> 00:52:58,039
l couldn't sell these.
They're never finished. Biccy?

749
00:52:59,624 --> 00:53:02,585
No, thanks.
They're never finished?

750
00:53:02,668 --> 00:53:07,131
No, they're just what l do
for myself.

751
00:53:07,173 --> 00:53:09,717
What l feel.

752
00:53:09,801 --> 00:53:12,470
You ask lots of questions, Mr. Mill.

753
00:53:12,553 --> 00:53:16,307
Just like the police.
That's all they did, ask questions.

754
00:53:18,017 --> 00:53:19,936
They asked me a lot about you.

755
00:53:20,019 --> 00:53:21,729
Did they?

756
00:53:21,813 --> 00:53:23,731
How long we'd known each other.

757
00:53:23,815 --> 00:53:25,817
lf you'd ever been
to the house before.

758
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:30,738
- They have to ask those questions.
- l don't see why.

759
00:53:30,822 --> 00:53:33,074
Because that's what police do.

760
00:53:34,117 --> 00:53:37,286
- Can l ask you a question?
- Sure.

761
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:40,123
Why was it so important
to see David that night?

762
00:53:40,206 --> 00:53:42,291
What was so urgent?

763
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,838
He pitched me a story
a few months ago.

764
00:53:46,921 --> 00:53:49,215
- The Japan story?
- Yes, the Japan story.

765
00:53:49,298 --> 00:53:52,844
l liked it but it needed work,
especially the ending.

766
00:53:52,927 --> 00:53:55,721
l was sitting in my office...

767
00:53:55,805 --> 00:53:58,766
and it suddenly occurred to me
how to make the ending work.

768
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:00,977
So what was it?

769
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:02,478
What?

770
00:54:02,562 --> 00:54:05,523
Your idea for the ending.

771
00:54:05,606 --> 00:54:07,608
Up.

772
00:54:07,692 --> 00:54:09,861
Up? What does that mean?

773
00:54:09,944 --> 00:54:12,697
As opposed to down. Moods.

774
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:15,950
You know, happy as opposed to sad.
Hopeful as opposed to depressing.

775
00:54:16,033 --> 00:54:19,704
- What did you think of his ending?
- l never read it.

776
00:54:21,622 --> 00:54:24,250
- You never read it?
- Nope.

777
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:26,752
l don't like reading.

778
00:54:26,836 --> 00:54:32,008
- Do you like books?
- l like words and letters.

779
00:54:32,091 --> 00:54:34,343
But l'm not crazy
about complete sentences.

780
00:54:36,095 --> 00:54:38,598
What did he think?

781
00:54:38,681 --> 00:54:42,435
He walked out on me.
l don't think David liked me.

782
00:54:42,518 --> 00:54:46,439
l think he just didn't like
happy endings.

783
00:54:50,193 --> 00:54:52,361
Put your face here.

784
00:54:53,905 --> 00:54:55,323
Great.

785
00:54:57,492 --> 00:55:00,077
What are you doing?
You aren't going to paint me, are you?

786
00:55:00,161 --> 00:55:03,414
l might put you
in one of my paintings.

787
00:55:03,456 --> 00:55:07,126
There's one l want to do
of an lcelandic hero.

788
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:10,213
He's a thief
and he's made of fire.

789
00:55:10,296 --> 00:55:12,840
- You might not like that.
- Why not?

790
00:55:12,924 --> 00:55:15,635
Because you're in the movies...

791
00:55:15,718 --> 00:55:19,639
and in movies you can't have thieves
as heroes, can you?

792
00:55:19,722 --> 00:55:23,309
l don't know about that. We have a long
tradition of gangsters in movies.

793
00:55:23,392 --> 00:55:27,105
Yes, but they always have to suffer
for their crimes, don't they?

794
00:55:28,689 --> 00:55:30,858
We should pay for our crimes,
shouldn't we?

795
00:55:30,942 --> 00:55:35,279
l think knowing you've committed a crime
is suffering enough.

796
00:55:35,321 --> 00:55:37,323
lf you don't suffer...

797
00:55:37,406 --> 00:55:41,119
maybe it wasn't a crime after all.

798
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,704
Anyway, what difference does it make?

799
00:55:43,788 --> 00:55:47,041
lt has nothing to do
with how things really are.

800
00:55:51,379 --> 00:55:54,048
Do you really believe that?

801
00:55:54,132 --> 00:55:57,510
l don't know what l believe, Mr. Mill.

802
00:55:57,593 --> 00:56:00,388
lt's just what l feel.

803
00:56:02,056 --> 00:56:05,852
You know what you are,
June whatever-your-name-is?

804
00:56:05,935 --> 00:56:07,603
A pragmatic anarchist.

805
00:56:09,063 --> 00:56:11,023
ls that what l am?

806
00:56:11,065 --> 00:56:13,192
l never was sure.

807
00:56:17,697 --> 00:56:20,116
Can l just pick this up?

808
00:56:21,367 --> 00:56:24,162
- Oh, it's heavy.
- Thirty-seven ounces.

809
00:56:24,203 --> 00:56:26,706
Really? Look.

810
00:56:26,747 --> 00:56:30,960
l want to thank my mother, her mother
and her father's mother who--

811
00:56:32,962 --> 00:56:34,380
Hello.

812
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:39,343
- Meet Detective Susan Avery.
- How do you do? My partner.

813
00:56:39,427 --> 00:56:42,513
- Willa Broom.
- My pleasure. Let's go in here.

814
00:56:42,597 --> 00:56:45,433
This is the first real movie studio
Detective Avery's been to.

815
00:56:45,516 --> 00:56:48,519
- Really?
- Aside from the Universal Tour.

816
00:56:48,603 --> 00:56:51,189
l always take my family there
when they come.

817
00:56:51,272 --> 00:56:54,817
l've been there so often,
l feel like l'm ready to direct.

818
00:56:54,901 --> 00:56:59,405
You'd probably do better
than the film grads these days.

819
00:56:59,489 --> 00:57:02,158
l'm sorry l didn't call you
when l heard Kahane was dead.

820
00:57:02,241 --> 00:57:03,910
- Heard or read?
- Read.

821
00:57:03,951 --> 00:57:07,413
- Why didn't you?
- Walter asked me the same question.

822
00:57:07,497 --> 00:57:11,542
l wish l had a better answer. All
l can say is l didn't think about it.

823
00:57:14,045 --> 00:57:16,130
How did you know where
he was gonna be?

824
00:57:16,214 --> 00:57:19,550
- His wife told me--
- Girlfriend.

825
00:57:20,551 --> 00:57:21,969
Girlfriend.

826
00:57:22,053 --> 00:57:24,263
Girlfriend.
l didn't know either of them.

827
00:57:24,305 --> 00:57:26,682
l was restless,
thought l'd see the movie.

828
00:57:26,766 --> 00:57:30,144
lf he was there, l'd talk to him
about a job l thought he was good for.

829
00:57:30,228 --> 00:57:32,396
You got to the theater,
saw him and?

830
00:57:32,438 --> 00:57:35,108
We had a drink at a Japanese place.

831
00:57:35,191 --> 00:57:39,070
lt was a wild, incredible scene.
lt was like Tokyo.

832
00:57:39,153 --> 00:57:41,989
He left before you.
Why didn't you leave together?

833
00:57:42,073 --> 00:57:44,700
lt was an incredible scene.
l was having a great time.

834
00:57:44,784 --> 00:57:46,619
Why didn't you stay longer?

835
00:57:46,702 --> 00:57:50,915
People stopped singing. Then it was just
a bar and l don't drink.

836
00:57:50,998 --> 00:57:53,918
- You drank with him.
- When in Rome--

837
00:57:54,001 --> 00:57:57,964
Did you know him socially?
Been to his house?

838
00:57:58,047 --> 00:58:00,091
Know anything about him personally?

839
00:58:02,009 --> 00:58:04,929
We'll let you get back to work now.

840
00:58:07,473 --> 00:58:09,475
What's bothering you?

841
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:12,437
Well, l just have to ask.

842
00:58:12,478 --> 00:58:16,315
Did you see him in the parking lot
after you left?

843
00:58:16,399 --> 00:58:19,986
No, l parked on the street.
l drive a Range Rover...

844
00:58:20,069 --> 00:58:22,488
so l feel safer
when it's visible.

845
00:58:22,572 --> 00:58:25,199
Who's gonna smash a window
if it's on the street?

846
00:58:25,283 --> 00:58:28,744
lf you had a shitty car,
you would've parked in the parking lot?

847
00:58:28,828 --> 00:58:31,706
lf l had a shitty car,
l might be a dead man.

848
00:58:31,789 --> 00:58:35,168
Somehow l think you're too lucky
for that.

849
00:58:35,209 --> 00:58:37,086
Thank you.

850
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:39,964
Okay, 63, take three. Marker.

851
00:58:40,923 --> 00:58:43,342
Now.

852
00:58:43,426 --> 00:58:45,094
Action!

853
00:58:46,387 --> 00:58:50,683
No, goddamn it, you listen to me!
l've been around a while. l got a nose.

854
00:58:50,725 --> 00:58:54,520
This situation stinks.
lt stinks of the company.

855
00:58:54,562 --> 00:58:58,399
That's right, Peterson,
the fucking ClA. Ever heard of it?

856
00:58:58,483 --> 00:59:00,777
lt's the kind of operation--

857
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:03,946
You don't understand what he's trying
to go for here.

858
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:06,949
lt's hard to listen to your argument
when you don't understand.

859
00:59:07,033 --> 00:59:11,496
- Would you shut up, please?
- Kiss my ass!

860
00:59:11,537 --> 00:59:13,873
l have to cut.
My robe cut on the drawer.

861
00:59:13,956 --> 00:59:18,294
- For Christ's sakes!
- l like this guy. He's great.

862
00:59:18,377 --> 00:59:23,257
Waters?
Can l have some Volvic, please?

863
00:59:23,341 --> 00:59:25,343
Yeah, he's great.

864
00:59:26,761 --> 00:59:29,847
l heard the police came to see you
about this dead writer.

865
00:59:29,889 --> 00:59:33,559
- Who was this guy?
- His name was David Kahane.

866
00:59:33,643 --> 00:59:36,687
l never heard of him.
We ever hire him for anything?

867
00:59:36,729 --> 00:59:39,732
l was thinking about it.

868
00:59:39,774 --> 00:59:43,569
He pitched me a story.
l went there to talk to him about it.

869
00:59:43,611 --> 00:59:44,529
Jesus. Poor bastard. Just when his ship
comes in, some bastard blasts him--

870
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:49,200
Jesus. Poor bastard. Just when his ship
comes in, some bastard blasts him--

871
00:59:49,283 --> 00:59:51,911
l don't want to criticize you...

872
00:59:51,953 --> 00:59:54,997
but l'm supposed to be talking
on the phone.

873
00:59:55,081 --> 00:59:56,916
Are the cops still bothering you?

874
00:59:56,999 --> 01:00:01,504
- No. No, l don't think so.
- Let Stuckel handle it.

875
01:00:01,587 --> 01:00:05,716
We'll give them passes to a screening.
They can sit behind Michelle Pfeiffer.

876
01:00:05,758 --> 01:00:07,969
They'll leave you alone.

877
01:00:09,262 --> 01:00:12,890
A guy named Joe Gillis called.

878
01:00:12,932 --> 01:00:17,603
He wants you to meet him at the
St. James Club at 10:00 on the patio.

879
01:00:17,687 --> 01:00:21,691
- Never heard of him.
- He said you'd know him.

880
01:00:21,774 --> 01:00:23,734
Anybody know who Joe Gillis is?

881
01:00:23,818 --> 01:00:26,529
He's a character William Holden played
in Sunset Boulevard.

882
01:00:26,612 --> 01:00:30,867
- The writer killed by a movie star.
- Gloria Swanson.

883
01:00:35,329 --> 01:00:39,083
Oh, that guy. Last week he said
he was Charles Foster Kane.

884
01:00:39,125 --> 01:00:41,961
A week before that
it was Rhett Butler.

885
01:00:42,003 --> 01:00:45,339
Why would they think l would kill
my own sister's husband?

886
01:00:47,133 --> 01:00:49,302
l was in love with him.

887
01:01:30,343 --> 01:01:35,097
- Griffin? Griffin.
- Malcolm McDowell, good to see you.

888
01:01:35,181 --> 01:01:38,726
Listen. The next time
you want to badmouth me...

889
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:41,229
have the courage
to do it to my face.

890
01:01:41,312 --> 01:01:43,773
You guys are all the same.

891
01:01:54,117 --> 01:01:56,410
- You love it there?
- l love it. lt's wonderful.

892
01:01:56,494 --> 01:01:58,830
You love your career, don't you?
What is it?

893
01:01:58,913 --> 01:02:02,959
lt was a complete disaster.
Look what happened in Heaven's Gate.

894
01:02:03,042 --> 01:02:04,210
We both are concerned...

895
01:02:04,293 --> 01:02:06,629
about your career.

896
01:02:06,712 --> 01:02:09,382
Where l live, l know how people
think and feel.

897
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:14,762
Montana will end you.
lt ended Cimino in Heaven's Gate.

898
01:02:14,846 --> 01:02:18,933
- Griffin Mill, hi. Andy Civella.
- Andy, how are you?

899
01:02:19,016 --> 01:02:22,687
l've got Andie MacDowell sitting over
here. You know her. She's so hot.

900
01:02:22,728 --> 01:02:25,022
- Come over and meet her.
- Still living in New York?

901
01:02:25,064 --> 01:02:28,067
l couldn't live here.
l'm allergic to happiness.

902
01:02:28,151 --> 01:02:32,071
Andie, it's good to see you again.
How are the kids?

903
01:02:32,155 --> 01:02:34,574
Great, thanks.
He's wonderful, thank you.

904
01:02:35,908 --> 01:02:38,286
You geniuses know each other.
Tom Oakley.

905
01:02:38,369 --> 01:02:41,414
- Yes, Hi, Tom.
- How are you?

906
01:02:41,497 --> 01:02:44,584
- Funny. l just saw Malcolm McDowell.
- Really?

907
01:02:44,667 --> 01:02:48,004
Roddy McDowall is related
to a cousin of my brother-in-law.

908
01:02:48,087 --> 01:02:50,756
Well, l'm not related
to either one of them.

909
01:03:00,766 --> 01:03:02,769
lf l write it, l direct it.

910
01:03:02,852 --> 01:03:06,272
The last three pictures you directed
were bombs!

911
01:03:06,355 --> 01:03:09,692
Thank you for the drink.
l've got to go.

912
01:03:09,776 --> 01:03:13,404
You've got to go?
We'll walk you to the car.

913
01:03:13,446 --> 01:03:15,907
No, it's okay.
Don't worry about it.

914
01:03:15,948 --> 01:03:18,493
We'd like to buy you a drink.

915
01:03:18,576 --> 01:03:21,537
l can't. l'm meeting someone.
Business.

916
01:03:21,621 --> 01:03:24,791
-We should tell him about Habeas Corpus.
-Of course, but he's a busy man.

917
01:03:24,874 --> 01:03:27,960
- ls there anyone waiting for me?
- No one's asked.

918
01:03:28,044 --> 01:03:31,714
l'm expecting someone.
l'll be out by the pool.

919
01:03:31,798 --> 01:03:34,717
But he'll get back to us.
Right, Griffin?

920
01:04:10,378 --> 01:04:11,796
Oh, sorry.

921
01:04:11,879 --> 01:04:14,549
- Jesus, Andy, it's you.
- Of course it's me.

922
01:04:14,632 --> 01:04:17,969
l can't ask you to join me.
l told you. l'm meeting somebody.

923
01:04:18,052 --> 01:04:20,888
Yeah. You're meeting me.
We got some big business.

924
01:04:20,972 --> 01:04:22,557
You? You?

925
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:26,394
- Why not me?
- You think this is fucking funny?

926
01:04:26,477 --> 01:04:28,396
What are you talking about?

927
01:04:28,479 --> 01:04:33,109
Wouldn't she make a great Nora? l'd love
to write another Doll's House for her.

928
01:04:33,192 --> 01:04:35,945
Did you meet Tom Oakley?

929
01:04:36,028 --> 01:04:40,283
- Yes. You mean you didn't call me?
- No, l didn't call you.

930
01:04:40,366 --> 01:04:43,244
l'm sorry. l'm really sorry.

931
01:04:44,328 --> 01:04:47,748
Listen, l really am meeting somebody.

932
01:04:47,832 --> 01:04:51,377
There's no way l can hear a pitch
right now. Call me tomorrow.

933
01:04:51,461 --> 01:04:56,549
No, l can't do it tomorrow. l've got
a meeting at Paramount and Universal.

934
01:04:56,632 --> 01:04:58,259
Congratulations.

935
01:04:58,342 --> 01:05:00,678
- lf you don't hear it now, you'll lose.
- Then l lose it.

936
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,889
lt'll take 20 seconds.
When your friend gets here--

937
01:05:02,972 --> 01:05:05,975
- What friend?
- Whoever you're gonna meet.

938
01:05:08,436 --> 01:05:10,396
Twenty-five words or less.

939
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,233
Absolutely. You sit here, Tom.
Go.

940
01:05:15,318 --> 01:05:18,112
- The D.A. is at a moral crossroads.
- Tom! Jesus Christ.

941
01:05:19,864 --> 01:05:23,201
We open outside
the largest penitentiary in California.

942
01:05:23,242 --> 01:05:26,662
lt's night. lt's raining.
A limousine comes through the gate...

943
01:05:26,746 --> 01:05:30,166
past demonstrators holding
a candlelight vigil.

944
01:05:30,249 --> 01:05:33,961
The candles under the umbrellas
glow like Japanese lanterns.

945
01:05:34,045 --> 01:05:37,048
That's nice. l haven't seen that before.
That's good.

946
01:05:37,131 --> 01:05:40,968
A lone demonstrator, a black woman,
steps in front of the limousine.

947
01:05:41,052 --> 01:05:43,346
The lights illuminate her
like a spirit.

948
01:05:43,429 --> 01:05:46,849
Her eyes fix upon those
of the sole passenger.

949
01:05:49,102 --> 01:05:51,020
The moment is devastating
between them.

950
01:05:51,104 --> 01:05:54,315
He's the D.A. She's the mother
of the person being executed.

951
01:05:54,398 --> 01:05:56,984
You're good!
l told you he's good.

952
01:05:57,068 --> 01:05:58,486
Go on.

953
01:05:58,569 --> 01:06:01,155
The D.A. believes
in the death penalty.

954
01:06:01,239 --> 01:06:05,993
And the execution is a hard case.
Black, 19, and definitely guilty.

955
01:06:06,077 --> 01:06:10,540
The greatest democracy in the world, and
36% of people on death row are black.

956
01:06:10,623 --> 01:06:12,625
Poor, disadvantaged black.

957
01:06:12,708 --> 01:06:15,628
He swears the next person
he sees to die...

958
01:06:15,711 --> 01:06:18,089
will be smart, rich and white.

959
01:06:18,131 --> 01:06:21,926
- You, me, whoever.
- What a hook! Beauty hook.

960
01:06:21,968 --> 01:06:24,095
Cut to the chase.

961
01:06:24,178 --> 01:06:28,558
Cut from the D.A. to an up-market
suburban neighborhood.

962
01:06:28,641 --> 01:06:31,978
A couple have a fight.
He leaves in a fit, gets in a car.

963
01:06:32,061 --> 01:06:34,188
lt's the same rainy night.

964
01:06:34,272 --> 01:06:36,983
The car spins out
and goes into a ravine.

965
01:06:37,066 --> 01:06:39,277
The body is swept away.

966
01:06:39,318 --> 01:06:44,407
When the police examine the car, they
find the brakes have been tampered with.

967
01:06:44,490 --> 01:06:47,785
lt's murder, and the D.A. decides
to go for the big one.

968
01:06:47,827 --> 01:06:50,496
He's going to put the wife
in the gas chamber.

969
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:52,498
But the D.A. falls in love
with the wife.

970
01:06:52,582 --> 01:06:54,834
Of course! But he puts her
in the gas chamber anyway.

971
01:06:55,877 --> 01:06:58,880
Then he finds that the husband
is alive.

972
01:06:58,963 --> 01:07:01,716
That he faked his death.

973
01:07:01,799 --> 01:07:05,011
The D.A. breaks into the prison,
runs down death row...

974
01:07:05,094 --> 01:07:07,138
but he gets there too late.

975
01:07:07,221 --> 01:07:09,682
The gas pellets have been dropped.

976
01:07:09,765 --> 01:07:12,059
She's dead.

977
01:07:12,143 --> 01:07:16,063
l tell you,
there's not a dry eye in the house.

978
01:07:16,147 --> 01:07:17,774
She's dead?

979
01:07:17,857 --> 01:07:22,737
She's dead. She's dead
because that's the reality.

980
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:25,782
The innocent die.

981
01:07:25,865 --> 01:07:28,951
- Who's the D.A.?
- No one.

982
01:07:29,035 --> 01:07:30,036
No one?

983
01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:33,122
No stars on this project.
We're going out on a limb on one.

984
01:07:33,206 --> 01:07:36,000
Like unknown stage actors...

985
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:38,753
or maybe somebody English
like what's-his-name.

986
01:07:40,963 --> 01:07:42,840
- Why?
- Why?

987
01:07:42,882 --> 01:07:48,221
This story is too damned important to
risk being overwhelmed by personality.

988
01:07:48,304 --> 01:07:50,932
That's fine for action pictures,
but this is special.

989
01:07:51,015 --> 01:07:52,934
We want real people.

990
01:07:53,017 --> 01:07:55,812
We don't want people coming
with any preconceived notions.

991
01:07:55,895 --> 01:07:59,607
-We want 'em to see a district attorney.
-Bruce Willis.

992
01:07:59,690 --> 01:08:02,360
Not Bruce Willis or Kevin Costner.

993
01:08:02,401 --> 01:08:05,321
This is an innocent woman
fighting for her life.

994
01:08:05,404 --> 01:08:07,365
- Julia Roberts.
- lf we can get her.

995
01:08:07,406 --> 01:08:08,866
We can!

996
01:08:08,908 --> 01:08:13,538
lf l'm perfectly honest,
this isn't even an American film.

997
01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:19,877
- lt's not?
- No. There are no stars.

998
01:08:19,919 --> 01:08:22,713
No pat happy endings,
no Schwarzenegger, no stickups...

999
01:08:22,755 --> 01:08:24,757
no terrorists.

1000
01:08:24,841 --> 01:08:28,636
This is a tough story, a tragedy
in which an innocent woman dies.

1001
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:32,682
Why? Because that happens!

1002
01:08:34,684 --> 01:08:36,978
Habeas Corpus.

1003
01:08:37,061 --> 01:08:41,774
That's what we're calling it.
'Produce the Corpse.' What do you say?

1004
01:08:43,109 --> 01:08:48,072
-That pitch was more than 25 words.
-But it's brilliant! What's the verdict?

1005
01:08:48,114 --> 01:08:51,409
- Mr. Mill, for you.
- Who gave this to you?

1006
01:08:51,451 --> 01:08:54,787
- l received it at the front desk.
- What is it?

1007
01:08:57,623 --> 01:09:01,252
lt's from the person l was meeting.

1008
01:09:01,294 --> 01:09:03,296
He's not coming.

1009
01:09:03,379 --> 01:09:06,007
Do we have a shot?

1010
01:09:06,090 --> 01:09:09,552
lt's an intriguing idea.
Give me a call at the studio tomorrow.

1011
01:09:09,635 --> 01:09:13,014
There's a scene in Throne of Blood
that has exactly the texture--

1012
01:09:13,097 --> 01:09:16,559
- Tom, just say thank you.
- She has to die! No Hollywood ending.

1013
01:09:16,642 --> 01:09:19,771
Tom, say thank you!

1014
01:11:13,718 --> 01:11:18,473
Fuck! You fucking dog-shit writer!
You fucking tried to kill me!

1015
01:11:42,121 --> 01:11:45,625
Oh, God, you gave me such a scare!

1016
01:11:45,666 --> 01:11:48,544
What are you doing here?

1017
01:11:48,628 --> 01:11:52,465
You gave me such a fright.
Come in.

1018
01:11:52,507 --> 01:11:54,217
Come on in.

1019
01:11:56,052 --> 01:11:59,972
What's the matter?
You look terrible.

1020
01:12:00,014 --> 01:12:01,474
What's up?

1021
01:12:03,976 --> 01:12:06,479
Sit down.
l'll get you a drink.

1022
01:12:17,448 --> 01:12:19,492
Something happened.

1023
01:12:20,701 --> 01:12:24,872
- ls it too late?
- No, it's not too late.

1024
01:12:24,956 --> 01:12:27,125
l don't even know what time it is.

1025
01:12:27,208 --> 01:12:28,960
What's wrong?

1026
01:12:34,257 --> 01:12:39,262
- What are you painting? ls that me?
- Yes, it's you.

1027
01:12:40,888 --> 01:12:42,431
See?

1028
01:12:42,515 --> 01:12:44,642
Do you have snakes in lceland?

1029
01:12:44,725 --> 01:12:46,727
Snakes? No, l don't think so.

1030
01:12:46,811 --> 01:12:48,771
Are you afraid of snakes?

1031
01:12:48,855 --> 01:12:51,816
l don't know.
l've never come close to a real one.

1032
01:12:51,899 --> 01:12:54,527
They scare the shit out of me.

1033
01:13:00,032 --> 01:13:01,534
Have another.

1034
01:13:01,576 --> 01:13:03,953
l don't usually drink.

1035
01:13:07,248 --> 01:13:10,710
Something happened tonight.

1036
01:13:10,751 --> 01:13:12,587
Yes, but...

1037
01:13:14,714 --> 01:13:17,717
there's something else
l have to tell you.

1038
01:13:19,802 --> 01:13:22,972
This isn't easy for me.

1039
01:13:23,055 --> 01:13:24,474
Yes?

1040
01:13:31,439 --> 01:13:33,983
How about if l just get on
with my work...

1041
01:13:34,066 --> 01:13:37,987
and you talk to me
when you feel like it, okay?

1042
01:13:45,286 --> 01:13:47,914
l came very close
to dying tonight.

1043
01:13:51,584 --> 01:13:53,961
All l could think about
was you.

1044
01:13:55,004 --> 01:13:57,590
l don't even know you...

1045
01:13:57,632 --> 01:14:00,551
but you came into my mind.

1046
01:14:04,347 --> 01:14:07,308
l couldn't think of anything else.

1047
01:14:09,727 --> 01:14:12,647
Remember that first night
we spoke on the phone?

1048
01:14:14,857 --> 01:14:19,028
l was outside these windows
watching you and--

1049
01:14:23,241 --> 01:14:25,660
lt was so exciting.

1050
01:14:27,787 --> 01:14:29,580
So new.

1051
01:14:31,916 --> 01:14:33,501
Strange.

1052
01:14:36,879 --> 01:14:39,799
l can't get you out of my mind.

1053
01:14:42,718 --> 01:14:45,888
Are you making love to me?

1054
01:14:47,974 --> 01:14:50,059
Yes, l guess l am.

1055
01:14:51,894 --> 01:14:53,855
l guess l am.

1056
01:14:57,108 --> 01:14:59,485
l want to make love to you.

1057
01:15:07,201 --> 01:15:09,245
lt's too soon.

1058
01:15:12,373 --> 01:15:14,709
lt's too soon, isn't it?

1059
01:15:16,669 --> 01:15:19,255
lt's so strange
how things happen.

1060
01:15:21,257 --> 01:15:23,551
David was here...

1061
01:15:23,634 --> 01:15:25,595
then he left.

1062
01:15:26,721 --> 01:15:28,514
You arrived.

1063
01:15:31,017 --> 01:15:34,020
Maybe it's just the timing,
but l feel like...

1064
01:15:34,103 --> 01:15:37,231
l would go anywhere with you...

1065
01:15:38,983 --> 01:15:40,902
if you asked.

1066
01:15:44,655 --> 01:15:47,074
But we mustn't hurry things.

1067
01:15:47,116 --> 01:15:50,578
We can't hurry things...

1068
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:53,039
any more than we can stop them.

1069
01:15:55,249 --> 01:15:57,543
l think you better go now.

1070
01:15:57,585 --> 01:16:00,213
l think l'm going to cry now.

1071
01:16:04,592 --> 01:16:06,928
You better go quick.

1072
01:16:13,434 --> 01:16:15,061
l'm sorry.

1073
01:16:15,103 --> 01:16:18,439
No, no, don't be sorry.
Just go home...

1074
01:16:18,523 --> 01:16:21,776
and get some sleep.

1075
01:16:21,859 --> 01:16:24,278
Call me...

1076
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,114
tomorrow.

1077
01:16:27,281 --> 01:16:29,826
lnvite me on a proper date.

1078
01:16:30,910 --> 01:16:32,995
l'd like that.

1079
01:16:47,844 --> 01:16:52,014
Jan? Jan!
Get me Larry Levy on the phone.

1080
01:16:52,098 --> 01:16:54,767
- l don't think he's on the lot.
- Try his car.

1081
01:16:55,852 --> 01:16:59,313
- lsn't he at Fox?
- He used to be. Not anymore.

1082
01:16:59,397 --> 01:17:02,108
l pitched him something
a few months ago. He hated it.

1083
01:17:03,317 --> 01:17:05,611
- That Griffin?
- Yeah.

1084
01:17:05,695 --> 01:17:09,991
Larry, Tom Oakley and Andy Civella
are here. l wouldn't bother you...

1085
01:17:10,032 --> 01:17:12,118
but you should hear their idea now.

1086
01:17:12,201 --> 01:17:14,662
- Hi, guys
- Hi, Larry.

1087
01:17:14,745 --> 01:17:19,750
The voice you'll hear has an English
accent. Tom Oakley. l'm Andy Civella.

1088
01:17:19,834 --> 01:17:22,420
Hi, Andy. l know Tom.
How are you?

1089
01:17:22,503 --> 01:17:24,630
Very well, Larry.
And yourself?

1090
01:17:24,714 --> 01:17:26,757
Fine. What's your story?

1091
01:17:27,884 --> 01:17:31,512
We open outside San Quentin.
lt's night.

1092
01:17:31,554 --> 01:17:33,306
lt's raining.

1093
01:17:33,389 --> 01:17:36,768
A limousine enters through the gate,
past demonstrators...

1094
01:17:36,851 --> 01:17:39,479
holding a candlelight vigil.

1095
01:17:39,562 --> 01:17:42,815
The candles flicker under umbrellas
glowing like Japanese lanterns.

1096
01:17:42,899 --> 01:17:46,611
A lone demonstrator, a black woman,
steps in front of the limousine.

1097
01:17:46,694 --> 01:17:49,280
Her eyes connect
with the lone passenger.

1098
01:17:49,363 --> 01:17:51,407
lt's a devastating moment.

1099
01:17:51,491 --> 01:17:53,367
lncredibly potent.

1100
01:17:55,703 --> 01:17:58,956
No stars. No Schwarzenegger.
No pat Hollywood endings.

1101
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:02,668
No car chases.
This is an American tragedy...

1102
01:18:02,752 --> 01:18:04,796
in which an innocent woman dies.

1103
01:18:04,879 --> 01:18:08,174
Because that happens.
That's reality.

1104
01:18:09,258 --> 01:18:11,219
Take me off the speaker phone.

1105
01:18:14,472 --> 01:18:19,185
l don't know. lt's a really hot story.
But what is this bullshit, no stars?

1106
01:18:19,268 --> 01:18:23,189
Let me give you a little tip.
Levison came to power on two movies.

1107
01:18:23,272 --> 01:18:25,650
He made $300 million
with no stars in them.

1108
01:18:25,733 --> 01:18:28,152
He will love this idea.
lt'll remind him of his youth.

1109
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:31,489
His motto used to be
'No stars, just talent.'

1110
01:18:31,572 --> 01:18:34,742
- Has anyone else heard this?
- l don't think so.

1111
01:18:35,618 --> 01:18:37,537
Make a deal now.

1112
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:40,706
Tomorrow may be too late.
Can we get ahold of Levison?

1113
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:43,251
Yeah, l'll get Levison.
When can you be back?

1114
01:18:43,292 --> 01:18:45,086
After my AA meeting.

1115
01:18:45,128 --> 01:18:49,882
l didn't realize
you had a drinking problem.

1116
01:18:49,966 --> 01:18:54,595
l don't really, but that's where all the
deals are being made these days. See ya.

1117
01:18:56,139 --> 01:18:58,266
Tom, that was a hell of a pitch.

1118
01:19:00,309 --> 01:19:03,146
Good work.
l think you sold Larry.

1119
01:19:03,229 --> 01:19:05,523
Great! When will we hear?

1120
01:19:05,606 --> 01:19:09,735
Go home, put some champagne on ice.
l'll give you an answer by tonight.

1121
01:19:09,819 --> 01:19:11,612
Jan, come here.

1122
01:19:11,654 --> 01:19:16,617
You move in mysterious ways,
but l like it.

1123
01:19:16,659 --> 01:19:18,661
Did Levy understand? No stars.

1124
01:19:18,703 --> 01:19:21,414
Yes, he was particularly attracted
to that notion.

1125
01:19:21,497 --> 01:19:23,708
- No Hollywood ending?
- No Hollywood ending.

1126
01:19:26,794 --> 01:19:29,005
They looked happy.

1127
01:19:29,088 --> 01:19:32,091
They have a completely fucked-up idea
that has no second act.

1128
01:19:32,175 --> 01:19:34,927
lf l hadn't heard it myself,
l never would've believed it.

1129
01:19:35,011 --> 01:19:38,181
Larry Levy liked it
because he's a dickbrain.

1130
01:19:38,264 --> 01:19:40,641
Levy will sell the idea
to Levison.

1131
01:19:40,683 --> 01:19:43,186
Then l will let Levison have
the brilliant idea...

1132
01:19:43,269 --> 01:19:46,481
of letting Larry
take over the project from me.

1133
01:19:46,564 --> 01:19:48,107
You will?

1134
01:19:48,191 --> 01:19:50,818
Levison can't wait
to get in bed with Levy.

1135
01:19:50,902 --> 01:19:55,156
This piece-of-shit idea
will blow up in both their faces.

1136
01:19:55,239 --> 01:19:59,660
And then l will step in
and save the day.

1137
01:20:01,913 --> 01:20:03,456
Yes!

1138
01:20:04,624 --> 01:20:06,834
Three points.

1139
01:20:06,876 --> 01:20:09,170
Great shot!

1140
01:20:12,548 --> 01:20:14,550
She's receiving the last rites.

1141
01:20:14,634 --> 01:20:17,345
The D.A. discovers that the husband
faked his own death.

1142
01:20:17,428 --> 01:20:20,807
She's innocent. He races to
the penitentiary, but it's too late.

1143
01:20:20,890 --> 01:20:23,351
The pellets have dropped.
She's dead.

1144
01:20:23,434 --> 01:20:25,937
He helped kill the woman he loved.

1145
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:29,357
- Who are the stars?
- No stars, just talent.

1146
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,484
No stars?

1147
01:20:31,567 --> 01:20:35,321
What the fuck kind of ending
do you call that? lt's depressing.

1148
01:20:35,404 --> 01:20:39,450
Depressing? Terms of Endearment,
Love Story, Steel Magnolias?

1149
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:42,495
E.T. grossed $319 million
worldwide...

1150
01:20:42,578 --> 01:20:44,705
and there wasn't a dry eye
in the house.

1151
01:20:44,747 --> 01:20:47,208
- Depressing? l don't think so.
- Yeah, but--

1152
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:50,044
Normally l'd agree with you, but this
is an entirely different kind of deal.

1153
01:20:50,086 --> 01:20:53,965
lt is a matter of taking the risk,
rolling the dice.

1154
01:20:54,048 --> 01:20:57,051
But if they come up 7,
bingo!

1155
01:20:58,177 --> 01:21:00,596
lt's Oscar time.

1156
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:03,182
- Do they screw?
- Who?

1157
01:21:03,266 --> 01:21:05,726
The D.A. and the woman.
Do they screw?

1158
01:21:05,768 --> 01:21:09,814
lf l'm going to be looking at jail cells
and gas chambers, you need some sex.

1159
01:21:09,897 --> 01:21:13,484
Sure, of course.
We'll get it there. No problem.

1160
01:21:13,568 --> 01:21:16,529
Who's gonna shepherd this thing?

1161
01:21:17,947 --> 01:21:20,533
Larry, you seem to have a good feel
for this. You want to run with it?

1162
01:21:20,616 --> 01:21:23,744
- This project originated with Griffin.
- Bonnie.

1163
01:21:23,786 --> 01:21:26,247
l don't want to dance
at somebody else's wedding.

1164
01:21:26,289 --> 01:21:28,791
lf it's Griffin's project,
it's Griffin's.

1165
01:21:28,875 --> 01:21:31,836
- We should--
- Bonnie, this will have to be my call.

1166
01:21:34,213 --> 01:21:36,132
lt's fine with me.

1167
01:21:36,215 --> 01:21:38,634
My plate is full anyway.

1168
01:21:38,718 --> 01:21:43,055
Larry, it's yours. Hit a home run,
win an Oscar for the home team.

1169
01:21:45,475 --> 01:21:48,811
Griffin, l've got something else
for you. New York tomorrow.

1170
01:21:48,895 --> 01:21:52,356
Tom Wolfe's new book will be in a room
at the hotel. Read it and make your bid.

1171
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,777
Send Bonnie. She'll know if it's
a movie. lf it is, the bid's a million.

1172
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:58,738
- Me?
- A million! That's high, isn't it?

1173
01:21:58,821 --> 01:22:01,532
lt's Tom Wolfe.
Why not you?

1174
01:22:01,616 --> 01:22:04,118
l'm a story editor.
That's a vice president's job.

1175
01:22:04,202 --> 01:22:07,246
- You don't want to be a vice president?
- Bonnie, pack your bags.

1176
01:22:07,330 --> 01:22:11,959
Congratulations. That was
the most amazing piece l've ever heard.

1177
01:22:12,001 --> 01:22:14,921
- lf you don't want the responsibility--
- No, l'm going.

1178
01:22:15,004 --> 01:22:17,256
l really want to be
one of your soldiers.

1179
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:21,219
- l'm glad you're on the team.
- Bonnie will be gone. l'm here for you.

1180
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:24,639
Whitney, now!

1181
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,475
Frank, Marty, come in.

1182
01:22:28,976 --> 01:22:31,062
- May l have a word with you?
- l have a meeting.

1183
01:22:31,145 --> 01:22:33,606
- Find the time. What is going on?
- What do you mean?

1184
01:22:33,689 --> 01:22:36,692
Handing Larry Levy your project.

1185
01:22:36,776 --> 01:22:39,195
l thought Larry had...

1186
01:22:39,278 --> 01:22:43,533
a firm grasp
on the style of the piece.

1187
01:22:43,616 --> 01:22:46,577
The only thing Larry Levy
has a firm grasp on is his dick!

1188
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:48,663
l'm not Oz,
l can't do everything.

1189
01:22:48,746 --> 01:22:50,998
Why shouldn't l use Larry if l think he
has what it takes to get a picture made?

1190
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:54,001
- That way everybody wins.
- Why are you bullshitting me?

1191
01:22:54,043 --> 01:22:56,379
- l'm not!
- You never used to bullshit me.

1192
01:22:56,462 --> 01:23:00,216
l know you.
You've been stringing me along.

1193
01:23:00,299 --> 01:23:03,302
- Habeas Corpus, Griff.
- Habeas Corpus.

1194
01:23:05,012 --> 01:23:07,390
You've been stringing me along
like one of your goddamn writers.

1195
01:23:07,473 --> 01:23:11,436
Why get Levison to send me to New York?
Are you trying to get rid of me?

1196
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:13,729
Get rid of you?
l'm trying to help you.

1197
01:23:13,813 --> 01:23:17,650
lf you score in New York, Levison
has to make you a vice president.

1198
01:23:17,733 --> 01:23:20,862
Jesus, are you afraid of success?

1199
01:23:20,903 --> 01:23:23,448
Are you seeing someone else?

1200
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:27,118
- That's what this is about?
- Not just this. lt's a lot of things.

1201
01:23:27,201 --> 01:23:30,496
lt's the way you've been acting.
Something is going on.

1202
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:32,540
Jesus Christ.

1203
01:23:32,623 --> 01:23:36,085
You're not even looking at me
when you're talking to me.

1204
01:23:36,127 --> 01:23:38,671
Please look me in the eyes
and just tell me.

1205
01:23:38,754 --> 01:23:42,383
No bullshit.
ls there someone else?

1206
01:23:46,387 --> 01:23:48,347
Have a good trip.

1207
01:23:54,437 --> 01:23:58,399
Our top story this evening involves
Hollywood's three favorite G's.

1208
01:23:58,483 --> 01:24:01,402
A glamourous, glitzy, gala night
on the town.

1209
01:24:01,444 --> 01:24:03,571
lt is a who's who of stars.

1210
01:24:03,654 --> 01:24:07,575
No l.D.s necessary,
household names one and all.

1211
01:24:07,617 --> 01:24:09,243
Leeza Gibbons reporting here.

1212
01:24:09,327 --> 01:24:12,538
Right this minute you could fire
a cannon down Sunset Boulevard...

1213
01:24:12,622 --> 01:24:14,916
and not come close to hitting
a celebrity.

1214
01:24:14,999 --> 01:24:18,795
Everybody who is anybody
is right here rubbing elbows...

1215
01:24:18,878 --> 01:24:21,130
and making big talk
in this ballroom.

1216
01:24:21,214 --> 01:24:24,759
All the movers, the shakers,
behind the scenes and on the screens.

1217
01:24:24,801 --> 01:24:27,929
Leave it to Cher to wear red...

1218
01:24:28,012 --> 01:24:30,389
when the impossible-to-come-by
invitations...

1219
01:24:30,473 --> 01:24:33,184
call for 'black and white only,
please.'

1220
01:24:33,267 --> 01:24:35,353
Hi, Terry, nice to see you.

1221
01:24:35,436 --> 01:24:38,189
June Gudmundsdottir,
Teri Garr, Buck Henry.

1222
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:42,652
The occasion this evening, as big
and important as the all-star turnout.

1223
01:24:42,693 --> 01:24:46,531
The studio, world-famous for the slogan
'Movies, now more than ever'...

1224
01:24:46,614 --> 01:24:51,160
is donating prints of 25 of its classic
black-and-white films to the museum.

1225
01:24:51,244 --> 01:24:54,622
Now they'll be able to say,
'Movies, now more than ever forever.'

1226
01:24:54,664 --> 01:24:56,833
Thank you.

1227
01:24:56,916 --> 01:25:01,963
lt's wonderful to see so many familiar
and friendly faces around.

1228
01:25:03,256 --> 01:25:08,469
As you know, the L.A. County Museum
has always been close to our hearts...

1229
01:25:08,553 --> 01:25:11,264
and especially the motion department.

1230
01:25:11,347 --> 01:25:13,766
Motion picture department!

1231
01:25:14,892 --> 01:25:18,104
We're happy to make possible
this donation.

1232
01:25:20,022 --> 01:25:23,818
l'd like to introduce a man
whose idea this all was.

1233
01:25:23,901 --> 01:25:26,279
Griffin Mill, please.

1234
01:25:32,535 --> 01:25:35,037
Thank you, Joel.

1235
01:25:35,121 --> 01:25:37,498
Grab another drink.

1236
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:43,504
l'd like to extend my thanks...

1237
01:25:43,546 --> 01:25:45,923
to the patrons of
the Los Angeles County Museum.

1238
01:25:46,924 --> 01:25:50,011
You have long fostered the art
of motion pictures...

1239
01:25:50,052 --> 01:25:53,931
as a serious and valuable art form
in this community.

1240
01:25:55,224 --> 01:25:58,269
Many people across the country
and around the world...

1241
01:25:58,352 --> 01:26:02,148
have for too long thought of movies
as a popular entertainment...

1242
01:26:02,231 --> 01:26:04,817
more than serious art.

1243
01:26:04,901 --> 01:26:08,988
l'm afraid a large majority of the press
supports this attitude.

1244
01:26:09,071 --> 01:26:12,909
We want great films
with long shelf lives.

1245
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:15,828
We want the films
of the new John Hustons...

1246
01:26:15,912 --> 01:26:18,873
Orson Welles, Frank Capras.

1247
01:26:18,956 --> 01:26:23,920
We and the other major film studios
have a responsibility to the public...

1248
01:26:24,003 --> 01:26:28,007
to maintain the art
of motion pictures...

1249
01:26:28,090 --> 01:26:31,010
as our primary mandate.

1250
01:26:31,093 --> 01:26:35,640
Movies are art, now...

1251
01:26:35,723 --> 01:26:37,767
more than ever.

1252
01:26:38,851 --> 01:26:40,394
Thank you.

1253
01:26:48,027 --> 01:26:50,905
Griffin, that was a hell of a job.
Couldn't have done it better myself.

1254
01:26:50,947 --> 01:26:53,616
l'll know all of your lines soon.

1255
01:26:55,827 --> 01:26:59,914
- Well, are we having fun yet?
- l'm having a great time.

1256
01:26:59,956 --> 01:27:04,669
'Griffin Mill, the writer's enemy.
l'll get back to you'

1257
01:27:14,137 --> 01:27:16,848
ls this a friend of a friend?

1258
01:27:16,931 --> 01:27:18,808
- Sorry?
- How did you meet?

1259
01:27:18,891 --> 01:27:22,437
We met at a funeral.

1260
01:27:22,478 --> 01:27:26,023
- lsn't that right?
- Absolutely. Excuse us.

1261
01:28:03,311 --> 01:28:06,063
Don't make a scene.

1262
01:28:13,321 --> 01:28:16,532
That's what l call a real date.

1263
01:28:21,579 --> 01:28:24,081
Should l come in?

1264
01:28:24,165 --> 01:28:27,335
- Well--
- Well?

1265
01:28:27,418 --> 01:28:31,172
Not tonight, but soon.

1266
01:28:32,381 --> 01:28:34,050
Very soon.

1267
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:39,013
- How about Mexico?
- Mexico?

1268
01:28:39,055 --> 01:28:41,057
Neutral territory.
Acapulco.

1269
01:28:41,140 --> 01:28:44,060
- l've never been there.
- We'll go.

1270
01:28:44,143 --> 01:28:46,562
- ls that the thing to do?
- That's a thing to do.

1271
01:28:46,604 --> 01:28:49,190
- Let's do it then.
- We'll go this weekend.

1272
01:28:49,273 --> 01:28:51,025
- Really?
- Yeah.

1273
01:28:53,569 --> 01:28:56,781
- Do l need a passport?
- Yes.

1274
01:29:44,912 --> 01:29:48,332
Mr. Mill, l'm Detective DeLongpre,
Pasadena police.

1275
01:29:48,416 --> 01:29:50,418
Yes, l recognize you.

1276
01:29:50,501 --> 01:29:52,753
Did you have a good time
at the party last night?

1277
01:29:52,795 --> 01:29:56,632
No, l didn't. l'm not supposed
to have a good time when l'm on duty.

1278
01:29:56,716 --> 01:29:59,135
Great. What do you want?

1279
01:29:59,218 --> 01:30:02,180
- Come down to the station.
- Why?

1280
01:30:02,263 --> 01:30:04,599
- To look at some pictures.
- Pictures?

1281
01:30:04,682 --> 01:30:08,019
Mug shots, like in the movies.

1282
01:30:08,102 --> 01:30:11,314
Ah, mug shots!
All right.

1283
01:30:11,397 --> 01:30:15,193
- Will you follow me to Pasadena?
- Pasadena.

1284
01:30:15,276 --> 01:30:18,070
Will you fasten your safety belt,
please?

1285
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:25,661
No! Take your hands off of her!

1286
01:30:25,745 --> 01:30:28,247
- l want my baby.
- Where's her baby?

1287
01:30:29,749 --> 01:30:32,335
- Mr. Mill!
- Hello, how are you?

1288
01:30:32,418 --> 01:30:35,713
Good to see you. Everybody,
this is Mr. Mill. He makes movies.

1289
01:30:35,797 --> 01:30:37,465
Have a seat.

1290
01:30:38,549 --> 01:30:41,594
Where the fuck is he going?
Excuse me. Mr. Mill?

1291
01:30:41,677 --> 01:30:46,182
Not in here. This is my lieutenant's
office. Have a seat here.

1292
01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:49,352
All right.

1293
01:30:49,435 --> 01:30:54,315
Willa, could you?
Your desk? Thank you.

1294
01:30:54,398 --> 01:30:56,609
Sorry. Have a seat, Mr. Mill.

1295
01:30:56,692 --> 01:31:00,029
Before we start,
Paul saw a movie last night.

1296
01:31:00,113 --> 01:31:02,323
He raved about it.

1297
01:31:02,365 --> 01:31:06,452
- What was the name of that movie?
- Freaks.

1298
01:31:06,536 --> 01:31:10,873
- Have you seen this?
- Tod Browning. Yes.

1299
01:31:10,957 --> 01:31:13,751
One of us, one of us.

1300
01:31:13,835 --> 01:31:16,212
He came in doing that.
He was raving about it.

1301
01:31:16,295 --> 01:31:20,508
He loved it.
lt was thrilling for me. Willa?

1302
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:25,388
Did you see where the tampons went?
l can't find them.

1303
01:31:25,471 --> 01:31:28,141
- l didn't take them.
- Did he take them?

1304
01:31:28,224 --> 01:31:30,143
- l don't know.
- Who did?

1305
01:31:30,226 --> 01:31:33,187
You see this? Damn!

1306
01:31:34,647 --> 01:31:38,192
- Do you have a break in the case?
- What makes you say that?

1307
01:31:38,234 --> 01:31:42,029
Well, why else
would you bring me here?

1308
01:31:43,489 --> 01:31:46,492
Why else, indeed.
Paul?

1309
01:31:46,576 --> 01:31:51,497
Paul, why have we brought
Mr. Mill in here today?

1310
01:31:51,581 --> 01:31:53,916
To look at some pictures.

1311
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,294
Pictures.

1312
01:31:56,377 --> 01:32:01,048
Could you, if you remember,
what were you wearing that night?

1313
01:32:01,132 --> 01:32:05,094
l was wearing a double-breasted suit,
l believe.

1314
01:32:05,178 --> 01:32:07,138
Just-- lt's all right.

1315
01:32:07,221 --> 01:32:10,183
What's the matter?
You're so jumpy. Sit down.

1316
01:32:10,266 --> 01:32:12,810
- l'll get it.
- No, that's what she's here for.

1317
01:32:12,894 --> 01:32:15,855
- Have a seat.
- Sorry.

1318
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:20,109
Will you take a look at this?

1319
01:32:20,193 --> 01:32:24,781
Where were they?
She found them. You're right.

1320
01:32:24,864 --> 01:32:27,575
Wait a minute.
No, these aren't mine.

1321
01:32:27,658 --> 01:32:29,660
These are slender regular.
These are yours.

1322
01:32:29,744 --> 01:32:34,457
- l guess you have jumbo.
- l use jumbo. These aren't mine.

1323
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:37,543
God, just trying to help you out.

1324
01:32:37,627 --> 01:32:40,755
Did you see this guy
the night of the murder?

1325
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:46,010
Sorry.

1326
01:32:46,093 --> 01:32:48,888
No, l, l-- You're putting me
in a terrible position here.

1327
01:32:48,971 --> 01:32:52,099
l would hate to get
the wrong person arrested.

1328
01:32:52,141 --> 01:32:56,354
Please! This is Pasadena. We do not
arrest the wrong person. That's L.A.

1329
01:32:56,437 --> 01:33:00,233
ln L.A. they kick your ass and then
they arrest you. We don't do that here.

1330
01:33:00,316 --> 01:33:02,777
Remember last year? What was
that guy's name they put on tape?

1331
01:33:02,819 --> 01:33:05,488
- What was that?
- King.

1332
01:33:05,571 --> 01:33:07,990
He was the wrong guy.

1333
01:33:11,202 --> 01:33:14,497
- Do you have a witness?
- l can't answer that.

1334
01:33:14,580 --> 01:33:18,292
Either you have a witness or these
are suspects in similar murders.

1335
01:33:18,334 --> 01:33:20,711
Have you been going
to detective school?

1336
01:33:20,795 --> 01:33:24,757
No, actually we're doing a movie
called Lonely Room.

1337
01:33:24,841 --> 01:33:26,884
Scott Glenn plays a detective
like yourself.

1338
01:33:26,968 --> 01:33:31,139
ls he a black woman?
Don't give me turkey.

1339
01:33:31,222 --> 01:33:35,935
Actually l was drawing the comparison
not based on race or gender.

1340
01:33:36,018 --> 01:33:40,440
Speaking of which,
did you go out with June--

1341
01:33:42,024 --> 01:33:45,445
- What is that woman's name?
- Gudmundsdottir.

1342
01:33:45,528 --> 01:33:47,029
What is it?

1343
01:33:47,113 --> 01:33:49,740
Who-- Spell it for me.

1344
01:33:49,824 --> 01:33:53,744
- G-U-D-M-U-N-D-S-D-O-T-T-l-R.
- That really helps.

1345
01:33:53,828 --> 01:33:57,165
- Did you go out with June--
- Gudmundsdottir.

1346
01:33:57,206 --> 01:33:59,959
- Yeah, her, last night?
- Yes, l did.

1347
01:34:00,042 --> 01:34:01,961
Have you known each other long?

1348
01:34:02,044 --> 01:34:04,505
No. l spoke to her for the first time
the night Kahane was killed.

1349
01:34:04,547 --> 01:34:08,759
- Wow. So you didn't know her before.
- No, l didn't.

1350
01:34:08,843 --> 01:34:12,722
We met over the phone. We got to talking
and one thing led to another.

1351
01:34:12,805 --> 01:34:15,308
Did you fuck her?

1352
01:34:15,391 --> 01:34:17,935
- What kind of question is that?
- l think it's pretty direct.

1353
01:34:18,019 --> 01:34:19,604
Did you fuck her?

1354
01:34:19,687 --> 01:34:23,399
l wouldn't answer that
without a lawyer in the room...

1355
01:34:23,483 --> 01:34:26,027
and then l probably
wouldn't even answer that question.

1356
01:34:26,110 --> 01:34:29,614
Why don't you ask your friend?
He's followed me. He'll probably know.

1357
01:34:29,697 --> 01:34:31,532
All right.

1358
01:34:31,616 --> 01:34:37,330
- Did Mr. Mill fuck June 'Hutmahuter'?
- l didn't see him.

1359
01:34:37,413 --> 01:34:40,291
- See? You got away with it.
- What are you implying?

1360
01:34:40,374 --> 01:34:43,586
l'm not implying anything. l asked you
a direct question. Did you fuck her?

1361
01:34:43,669 --> 01:34:46,005
l said l wouldn't answer
without a lawyer.

1362
01:34:46,088 --> 01:34:49,050
- Why are you getting angry?
- Because you're being rude.

1363
01:34:49,091 --> 01:34:54,597
Excuse me. But l think it's soon for her
to be gallivanting with you.

1364
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:57,016
l'm there for her as a friend.

1365
01:34:58,434 --> 01:35:03,606
Why don't you call her? l'm sure she'd
be happy to pick over this horror...

1366
01:35:03,689 --> 01:35:06,359
and tell you
how we became friends.

1367
01:35:06,442 --> 01:35:09,445
What is this, fucking lran?
Since when does the State...

1368
01:35:09,529 --> 01:35:13,324
tell us how long and with whom
we can share our grief?

1369
01:35:13,407 --> 01:35:16,285
Or do you hold June Gudmundsdottir...

1370
01:35:16,369 --> 01:35:19,539
to a special code reserved for women?

1371
01:35:26,003 --> 01:35:30,258
- What the fuck are you laughing at?
- lt's just--

1372
01:35:30,299 --> 01:35:33,052
l'd like to talk to my lawyer.

1373
01:35:33,136 --> 01:35:35,429
One of us, one of us.

1374
01:35:49,819 --> 01:35:52,155
lt's time to get a good lawyer.

1375
01:35:52,238 --> 01:35:55,783
l had a drink with the guy, Walter.
That's all.

1376
01:35:55,867 --> 01:36:00,329
lf you went to Pasadena with intent to
kill, you could go to the gas chamber.

1377
01:36:01,664 --> 01:36:04,208
l went to Pasadena
with the intent to hire.

1378
01:36:04,292 --> 01:36:06,210
So you say.

1379
01:36:06,252 --> 01:36:09,046
The Schecter brothers are here.

1380
01:36:09,130 --> 01:36:11,466
Griffin, don't make us wait.

1381
01:36:11,549 --> 01:36:14,177
- Who is this man?
- The travel agent called.

1382
01:36:14,260 --> 01:36:17,138
- You're confirmed.
- Travel agent?

1383
01:36:17,221 --> 01:36:19,599
l'm going to Puerto Vallarta.

1384
01:36:19,682 --> 01:36:22,810
- You're leaving the country.
- For the weekend.

1385
01:36:22,894 --> 01:36:25,563
- lt's a risk.
- Why?

1386
01:36:25,605 --> 01:36:28,858
Because Larry Levy could have my office
in three days.

1387
01:36:28,941 --> 01:36:32,403
- That's what Walter thinks.
- You know something l don't know?

1388
01:36:34,906 --> 01:36:38,367
- You're pretty smooth.
- l sleep at night.

1389
01:36:39,952 --> 01:36:42,330
- You really should run a studio.
- Tell a friend.

1390
01:36:42,413 --> 01:36:45,249
Walter, it's been real.

1391
01:36:45,333 --> 01:36:49,796
We're tired of shuffling things around.
We want to go exclusive to one studio.

1392
01:36:49,837 --> 01:36:51,798
- How much have our last pictures made?
- $105 million.

1393
01:36:51,881 --> 01:36:56,761
- Some do better but we're under budget.
- He's not listening. Go to Columbia.

1394
01:36:56,803 --> 01:36:59,806
- We already went to Columbia.
- Oh, yeah. What did they say?

1395
01:37:01,015 --> 01:37:03,684
Hey, l got the Tom Wolfe book.

1396
01:37:03,768 --> 01:37:06,020
Congratulations.

1397
01:37:06,104 --> 01:37:09,190
Bonnie, make him give us a deal.
We want a home.

1398
01:37:09,273 --> 01:37:11,275
We're tired of shopping
everything around.

1399
01:37:11,359 --> 01:37:13,361
l thought that's how you guys liked
to do business.

1400
01:37:13,444 --> 01:37:15,363
We changed our minds.

1401
01:37:16,739 --> 01:37:19,200
l'll talk to you later.

1402
01:37:19,283 --> 01:37:21,410
Levison says you're going
out of town tomorrow.

1403
01:37:21,494 --> 01:37:24,080
For the weekend.

1404
01:37:24,163 --> 01:37:27,792
Are you going with someone
named June something?

1405
01:37:27,834 --> 01:37:29,418
Yes.

1406
01:37:30,545 --> 01:37:35,007
You took her to a party
with several hundred of my best friends.

1407
01:37:35,049 --> 01:37:37,009
She's recently widowed.

1408
01:37:37,051 --> 01:37:39,637
You weren't in town
so l took her.

1409
01:37:41,013 --> 01:37:43,808
And now you're taking her to Mexico
for the weekend.

1410
01:37:46,018 --> 01:37:49,647
- Let's leave. Mom and Dad are fighting.
- Guys.

1411
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:53,943
Have your lawyer give me a call.
You've got a deal.

1412
01:37:54,026 --> 01:37:57,822
-Let's leave before he changes his mind.
-We have witnesses.

1413
01:38:10,751 --> 01:38:13,004
Have a good trip.

1414
01:38:14,922 --> 01:38:17,508
''M' The worst crime of all'

1415
01:38:38,571 --> 01:38:40,698
Did you bring your passport?

1416
01:38:40,782 --> 01:38:46,370
- Wanna hear something funny? l forgot.
- We'll have to go back and get it.

1417
01:38:46,454 --> 01:38:50,625
So stupid of me. We'll never be able
to make another plane. Damn it!

1418
01:38:51,876 --> 01:38:55,546
lt's all right. Anyway, l got a better
idea. Do you like the desert?

1419
01:38:55,630 --> 01:39:00,885
- l've never been.
- l know this great hideaway.

1420
01:39:00,927 --> 01:39:04,055
We'll go there. lt's a two hour drive.
l know the people. We'll call ahead.

1421
01:39:04,096 --> 01:39:06,516
Are we hiding?

1422
01:39:06,599 --> 01:39:09,560
Yes, we're hiding from everybody.

1423
01:39:11,896 --> 01:39:14,232
You'll like it there.
lt'll remind you of lceland.

1424
01:39:47,014 --> 01:39:51,269
Good evening, Mr. M. You're checked in.
Capone Villa. You know where it is.

1425
01:39:51,310 --> 01:39:53,646
Yes. Thanks.

1426
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:23,676
Look! The water looks like
it's steaming.

1427
01:40:23,759 --> 01:40:26,220
Comes out of the ground that way.

1428
01:40:48,034 --> 01:40:50,912
There aren't many people around.

1429
01:40:50,995 --> 01:40:53,331
They're fully booked, actually.

1430
01:40:53,372 --> 01:40:56,250
- There's 50 rooms, 100 people.
- Where are they all?

1431
01:40:57,919 --> 01:40:59,462
Hiding.

1432
01:41:00,546 --> 01:41:04,634
- Sir?
- Two Banning Springs waters, please.

1433
01:41:04,717 --> 01:41:06,344
Right away.

1434
01:41:09,180 --> 01:41:11,516
Do places like this really exist?

1435
01:41:12,934 --> 01:41:14,685
Only in the movies.

1436
01:41:45,466 --> 01:41:48,928
Tell me about the movies you make.

1437
01:41:48,970 --> 01:41:50,721
Why?

1438
01:41:50,763 --> 01:41:54,725
Because l want to know
what you do.

1439
01:41:56,310 --> 01:42:01,399
l listen to stories and decide
if they'll make good movies or not.

1440
01:42:02,442 --> 01:42:04,610
l get 125 phone calls a day...

1441
01:42:04,694 --> 01:42:08,448
and if l let that slip to 100...

1442
01:42:08,531 --> 01:42:12,076
l know l'm not doing my job.

1443
01:42:14,620 --> 01:42:18,416
Everyone who calls wants to know
one thing.

1444
01:42:18,499 --> 01:42:21,961
They want me to say yes to them
and make their movie.

1445
01:42:22,003 --> 01:42:24,839
lf l say yes,
they think that come New Year's...

1446
01:42:24,922 --> 01:42:28,885
it will be just them and Jack Nicholson
on the slopes of Aspen.

1447
01:42:30,470 --> 01:42:32,638
That's what they think.

1448
01:42:35,099 --> 01:42:37,935
The problem is
l can only say yes...

1449
01:42:37,977 --> 01:42:41,731
my studio can only say yes
12 times a year.

1450
01:42:41,814 --> 01:42:46,569
And collectively we hear
about 50,000 stories a year.

1451
01:42:46,652 --> 01:42:49,155
So it's hard.

1452
01:42:49,238 --> 01:42:52,742
And l guess sometimes
l'm not nice...

1453
01:42:52,825 --> 01:42:56,370
and make enemies.

1454
01:42:58,790 --> 01:43:01,083
That's what l was to David.

1455
01:43:02,043 --> 01:43:04,462
Enemy.

1456
01:43:04,545 --> 01:43:08,716
- Was his story one of the 12?
- No, it wasn't.

1457
01:43:09,717 --> 01:43:11,177
Why?

1458
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:16,349
lt lacked certain elements that we need
to market a film successfully.

1459
01:43:16,432 --> 01:43:18,142
What elements?

1460
01:43:20,645 --> 01:43:24,482
Suspense, laughter, violence...

1461
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:29,403
hope, heart...

1462
01:43:32,198 --> 01:43:33,950
nudity, sex...

1463
01:43:36,035 --> 01:43:37,620
happy endings.

1464
01:43:39,288 --> 01:43:41,499
Mainly happy endings.

1465
01:43:44,961 --> 01:43:46,921
What about reality?

1466
01:43:48,714 --> 01:43:51,509
You're not from lceland, are you?

1467
01:43:52,510 --> 01:43:54,512
Did l say that?

1468
01:43:57,849 --> 01:44:02,019
Why don't you put me in the hot springs
and see if l melt?

1469
01:44:50,109 --> 01:44:51,861
l love you.

1470
01:44:51,944 --> 01:44:53,905
l know.

1471
01:45:05,917 --> 01:45:10,880
There's something you have to know,
something l have to tell you.

1472
01:45:10,963 --> 01:45:15,051
That's all right.
Nothing can change that.

1473
01:45:15,134 --> 01:45:19,806
- June, David's death.
- lt's in the past.

1474
01:45:20,681 --> 01:45:24,102
Don't. lt's another life.

1475
01:45:24,143 --> 01:45:27,146
There's something you have to know.

1476
01:45:27,188 --> 01:45:30,274
Don't say any more.
Don't.

1477
01:45:30,316 --> 01:45:33,694
- l was responsible.
- l love you. Don't!

1478
01:45:33,778 --> 01:45:36,989
- lt was my fault.
- Don't say that.

1479
01:45:37,031 --> 01:45:40,201
Don't, don't.
l love you.

1480
01:47:00,490 --> 01:47:05,119
Mr. M., l'm sorry disturb you. There's
a phone call and it sounds important.

1481
01:47:05,203 --> 01:47:09,248
- Who is it?
- Dick Mellen. He says he's your lawyer.

1482
01:47:30,937 --> 01:47:32,897
Dick, how'd you find me?

1483
01:47:32,939 --> 01:47:36,150
Come on, who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

1484
01:47:36,234 --> 01:47:38,236
Yeah. What's going on?

1485
01:47:38,277 --> 01:47:41,322
- Levison's out.
- Out?

1486
01:47:41,405 --> 01:47:45,243
- He's cleaning out his office.
- Who's taking over?

1487
01:47:45,284 --> 01:47:49,539
Nothing's been decided. We only know
Reggie Goldman went home with the clap.

1488
01:47:49,622 --> 01:47:52,291
Am l in a position to--

1489
01:47:52,375 --> 01:47:56,671
No studio politics. Why didn't
you tell me about this Kahane business?

1490
01:47:58,256 --> 01:48:01,300
Kahane? l tried to, but--

1491
01:48:01,384 --> 01:48:03,344
You didn't try hard enough.

1492
01:48:03,427 --> 01:48:06,347
You better be at the Pasadena
police station in four hours.

1493
01:48:07,849 --> 01:48:10,101
Pasadena? What for?

1494
01:48:10,143 --> 01:48:15,064
For a fucking lineup.
They got a witness evidently.

1495
01:48:15,148 --> 01:48:17,567
l found you a guy.
His name is Gar Girard.

1496
01:48:17,650 --> 01:48:20,236
He's a topflight criminal lawyer.
He's tough, hard-nosed.

1497
01:48:20,319 --> 01:48:24,115
Don't talk to anybody else.
Just get there.

1498
01:48:24,157 --> 01:48:29,454
- l'll be there.
- This is a tough one. Good luck.

1499
01:48:41,007 --> 01:48:45,636
Mr. Mill, the studio's very upset
about the publicity this might generate.

1500
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:48,514
l'll handle the press, police, judge
and the witness.

1501
01:48:48,598 --> 01:48:52,894
Thank you for coming without a fight.
lt's in your best interest.

1502
01:48:52,977 --> 01:48:56,647
- Did you sleep in that suit?
- Get away from her. She's the enemy.

1503
01:48:56,689 --> 01:49:00,443
- Susan, l had a lovely time.
- l can't believe you remembered.

1504
01:49:00,526 --> 01:49:03,029
Mr. Mill, Gar Girard.
l'm here to represent you.

1505
01:49:03,112 --> 01:49:05,531
Dick Mellen called me in on this.
Here's the situation.

1506
01:49:05,615 --> 01:49:08,326
They've got a witness
and want you to do a lineup.

1507
01:49:08,367 --> 01:49:10,745
lf you say no, they'll arrest you.

1508
01:49:10,828 --> 01:49:13,873
Even if you get identified,
l'll get you off on bail.

1509
01:49:13,956 --> 01:49:17,460
This witness lives across the street
from the parking lot.

1510
01:49:17,543 --> 01:49:19,670
Even if she makes
an identification...

1511
01:49:19,754 --> 01:49:23,800
a positive l.D.,
it was very late at night.

1512
01:49:23,883 --> 01:49:27,762
By the time l'm finished with her, we'll
have a new legal standard for blindness.

1513
01:49:28,805 --> 01:49:32,016
This is like they do on TV.

1514
01:49:34,018 --> 01:49:37,730
Don't worry. You can see them,
but they can't see you.

1515
01:49:37,814 --> 01:49:40,733
Just tell the truth.

1516
01:49:40,775 --> 01:49:42,944
l saw him clearly.

1517
01:49:45,404 --> 01:49:47,532
Fire it up.

1518
01:49:47,615 --> 01:49:50,993
Number one, step forward.
Make a quarter turn to the right.

1519
01:49:53,246 --> 01:49:56,791
- Are those prescription glasses?
- You can't ask her that.

1520
01:49:56,874 --> 01:50:00,920
- lt's very hard, you know.
- Yeah, l know.

1521
01:50:01,003 --> 01:50:04,173
- l wouldn't want to pick the wrong one.
- No. God forbid.

1522
01:50:04,257 --> 01:50:08,386
- Just take your time.
- Anybody look...

1523
01:50:08,427 --> 01:50:10,763
vaguely familiar?

1524
01:50:10,847 --> 01:50:12,723
Well, you know--

1525
01:50:12,765 --> 01:50:14,767
Take your time.

1526
01:50:16,602 --> 01:50:20,481
- This is not easy.
- lt never is.

1527
01:50:20,565 --> 01:50:23,443
- l am trying.
- Yes, just take your time.

1528
01:50:23,526 --> 01:50:25,695
And l did see him clearly.

1529
01:50:33,119 --> 01:50:36,497
- l don't--
- Look hard. Take a good look.

1530
01:50:36,581 --> 01:50:38,499
l did. l am.

1531
01:50:39,459 --> 01:50:43,754
Um, could l see
number three again?

1532
01:50:43,796 --> 01:50:45,506
- Call number three.
- Wait.

1533
01:50:45,590 --> 01:50:48,801
- Could l--
- Could she call her own numbers?

1534
01:50:48,843 --> 01:50:52,096
- Excuse me, excuse me.
- Thank you.

1535
01:50:53,347 --> 01:50:56,267
Which number?
Number five.

1536
01:50:56,309 --> 01:50:58,853
Susan, l think she can call
who she's interested in.

1537
01:50:58,936 --> 01:51:01,022
- You're right.
- No, the other one.

1538
01:51:01,105 --> 01:51:02,607
That one.

1539
01:51:02,648 --> 01:51:05,359
Which one?

1540
01:51:05,443 --> 01:51:08,946
- lt's not number six.
- Not number six.

1541
01:51:08,988 --> 01:51:12,241
- Three.
- What do you mean number three?

1542
01:51:12,325 --> 01:51:14,452
l think she can request
who she wants to see.

1543
01:51:14,494 --> 01:51:17,246
- Wait. You want to see what number?
- Him.

1544
01:51:17,330 --> 01:51:20,750
That's him!
l'd swear on my mother's grave.

1545
01:51:20,833 --> 01:51:22,293
Number three.

1546
01:51:22,335 --> 01:51:25,004
- Number three?
- Number three.

1547
01:51:25,087 --> 01:51:27,423
Number three on her mother's grave.

1548
01:51:27,507 --> 01:51:29,842
We heard what she said.

1549
01:51:29,926 --> 01:51:31,844
Yeah, l would say so.

1550
01:51:31,928 --> 01:51:34,180
- Take them out.
- Number three. Thank you.

1551
01:51:35,765 --> 01:51:40,269
Ma'am, may l be personal?
Where the fuck is your mother buried?

1552
01:51:41,771 --> 01:51:44,023
Let's get out of here.

1553
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:52,990
l don't know who got to that witness.
She wrapped up my case picking that cop.

1554
01:51:53,032 --> 01:51:56,202
You're a lucky man, Mr. Mill.
Goddamn, no ramp again!

1555
01:51:56,285 --> 01:51:59,038
Witnesses can't be relied on.
Remember Witness for the Prosecution?

1556
01:51:59,122 --> 01:52:01,207
Marlene Dietrich
and Tyrone Power?

1557
01:52:01,290 --> 01:52:04,168
You're free as a bird.
No witness, no crime.

1558
01:52:04,210 --> 01:52:06,546
That Avery woman thinks you got away
with murder.

1559
01:52:06,629 --> 01:52:09,048
Everybody does, Mr. Mill.

1560
01:52:56,596 --> 01:52:59,140
Our Father who art in heaven...

1561
01:52:59,223 --> 01:53:01,350
hallowed be Thy name.

1562
01:53:01,434 --> 01:53:03,561
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done...

1563
01:53:03,644 --> 01:53:06,606
on earth as it is in heaven.

1564
01:53:06,647 --> 01:53:10,109
Give us this day
our daily bread...

1565
01:53:10,151 --> 01:53:12,945
and forgive us
our trespasses--

1566
01:54:51,627 --> 01:54:55,465
You have made a wonderful movie.
lt's perfect.

1567
01:54:55,548 --> 01:54:57,717
lt's Oscar time, Larry.

1568
01:55:03,431 --> 01:55:04,557
What?

1569
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:06,267
Too late. Come on.

1570
01:55:15,860 --> 01:55:17,445
Get back!

1571
01:55:37,924 --> 01:55:40,593
- What took you so long?
- Traffic was a bitch.

1572
01:55:51,395 --> 01:55:54,440
- lt's outstanding.
- The audience will love it.

1573
01:55:54,524 --> 01:55:56,109
You sold it out!

1574
01:55:56,150 --> 01:55:59,779
How could you let him sell you out?
What about truth? Reality?

1575
01:55:59,821 --> 01:56:03,074
What about the way the old ending
tested in Canoga Park?

1576
01:56:03,157 --> 01:56:06,536
Everybody hated it. We reshot it,
now everybody loves it.

1577
01:56:06,619 --> 01:56:10,289
- That's reality.
- But you had an ending which was true.

1578
01:56:10,331 --> 01:56:12,458
Who is this person?

1579
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:14,794
Doesn't she know anything
about working with grown-ups?

1580
01:56:14,836 --> 01:56:19,799
Bonnie, goddamn it. This is a hit.
This is what we're here for.

1581
01:56:19,841 --> 01:56:22,176
lt didn't have to end this way.

1582
01:56:22,218 --> 01:56:25,471
- l want you out of here.
- Good thinking, Larry.

1583
01:56:25,555 --> 01:56:27,765
l'm going over your head, Larry.

1584
01:56:27,849 --> 01:56:30,017
Bonnie, you're fired.

1585
01:56:31,686 --> 01:56:33,312
Fuck you!

1586
01:56:33,396 --> 01:56:36,649
lt takes more to make it
in this business than a dirty mouth.

1587
01:56:36,732 --> 01:56:38,985
The campaign.

1588
01:57:07,138 --> 01:57:09,348
lt's very important.
l must talk to him.

1589
01:57:09,432 --> 01:57:12,185
- He's very busy.
- Please?

1590
01:57:12,268 --> 01:57:14,270
lt's me, Bonnie.
We're friends.

1591
01:57:14,353 --> 01:57:18,399
You don't understand.
l am not just me, l'm also the job.

1592
01:57:18,483 --> 01:57:20,401
Please? Please?

1593
01:57:21,444 --> 01:57:25,281
All right. l'll try. Okay?

1594
01:57:31,579 --> 01:57:34,415
Walter, stop that nonsense!

1595
01:57:34,499 --> 01:57:37,460
Griffin, it's Bonnie.

1596
01:57:37,543 --> 01:57:39,337
She's here.

1597
01:57:43,925 --> 01:57:47,303
- Did Levy fire her?
- Yes, sir, l guess he did.

1598
01:57:49,096 --> 01:57:51,516
l can't see her now.

1599
01:57:51,599 --> 01:57:53,935
l promised l'd be home early.

1600
01:57:55,019 --> 01:57:56,938
Tell her l'll get back to her.

1601
01:57:57,021 --> 01:58:00,608
- Get your foot off the fucking couch.
- Tell her yourself.

1602
01:58:00,691 --> 01:58:05,071
Yes. Could you hold, please?
Griffin, it's Larry Levy's--

1603
01:58:05,113 --> 01:58:08,282
Please! Griffin, please,
can we talk about it?

1604
01:58:08,366 --> 01:58:10,952
Bonnie, l know
you'll land on your feet.

1605
01:58:11,035 --> 01:58:15,331
lt's Larry Levy's office.
He says it's very important.

1606
01:58:16,457 --> 01:58:19,335
Give it a minute,
then transfer it to the car phone.

1607
01:58:31,430 --> 01:58:34,642
- Yeah?
- l have Larry Levy on the line.

1608
01:58:34,725 --> 01:58:36,769
How did the screening go?
How's my new ending?

1609
01:58:36,853 --> 01:58:41,858
Fantastic! Worked like gangbusters.
That's why you get the big bucks.

1610
01:58:41,941 --> 01:58:45,445
Yeah. Stop kissing my ass.
What do you want? Can't this wait?

1611
01:58:45,528 --> 01:58:50,032
l don't think it should. This is hot.
You should hear this writer's pitch.

1612
01:58:50,116 --> 01:58:53,035
- We should go for this great idea.
- Who's the writer?

1613
01:58:53,119 --> 01:58:55,788
l'll put him on the speaker.
Hold on.

1614
01:58:55,830 --> 01:59:01,002
Hi, Griff. Remember me? l'm the asshole
who was in the postcard business.

1615
01:59:01,085 --> 01:59:05,506
- You.
- The king of suspense. You remember.

1616
01:59:05,590 --> 01:59:07,717
l haven't heard from you for a while.

1617
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:11,888
- l've been busy writing a script.
- Give him the pitch.

1618
01:59:11,971 --> 01:59:14,390
You'll love this. lt's great!

1619
01:59:14,474 --> 01:59:17,143
lt's a Hollywood story,
a real thriller.

1620
01:59:17,185 --> 01:59:20,646
lt's about a shit-bag producer,
studio exec...

1621
01:59:20,688 --> 01:59:24,358
who murders a writer
he thinks is harassing him.

1622
01:59:24,442 --> 01:59:27,487
The problem is,
he kills the wrong writer.

1623
01:59:27,528 --> 01:59:29,822
Now he's got to deal
with blackmail and the cops.

1624
01:59:29,864 --> 01:59:35,203
But, here's the switch.
The son of a bitch gets away with it.

1625
01:59:35,244 --> 01:59:37,497
Larry, get off the speaker.
l want to talk to him privately.

1626
01:59:37,580 --> 01:59:40,333
Sure.
This is a winner.

1627
01:59:40,374 --> 01:59:42,710
- He gets away with it?
- Absolutely.

1628
01:59:42,794 --> 01:59:44,504
A Hollywood ending.

1629
01:59:44,545 --> 01:59:48,174
He marries the dead writer's girl
and they live happily ever after.

1630
01:59:48,257 --> 01:59:52,637
- Can you guarantee that ending?
- lf the price is right, you got it.

1631
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:56,432
- Guarantee that ending, you got a deal.
- l guarantee it.

1632
01:59:56,516 --> 01:59:59,894
- What do you call this thing?
- The Player.

1633
01:59:59,977 --> 02:00:01,813
The Player.

1634
02:00:04,565 --> 02:00:06,734
l like that.

1635
02:00:09,237 --> 02:00:11,447
What took you so long?

1636
02:00:11,531 --> 02:00:13,783
Traffic was a bitch.
