MARTINEZ: <i>How's it looking
over there, Watney?</i>

5
00:02:12,557 --> 00:02:13,860
WATNEY: <i>Well, you'll
be happy to hear...</i>

6
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,795
<i>that in Grid Section 14-28,</i>

7
00:02:16,995 --> 00:02:19,731
<i>the particles were
predominantly coarse...</i>

8
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:23,101
but in 29, they're much finer...

9
00:02:23,301 --> 00:02:25,203
and they should be ideal for chem analysis.

10
00:02:25,403 --> 00:02:26,571
MARTINEZ: <i>Oh, wow. Did
everybody hear that?</i>

11
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,506
<i>Mark just discovered dirt.</i>

12
00:02:28,706 --> 00:02:29,775
(LAUGHS) <i>Should we alert the media?</i>

13
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:31,743
WATNEY: <i>Sorry, what are
you doing today, Martinez?</i>

14
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,644
Making sure the MAV is still upright?

15
00:02:33,844 --> 00:02:34,880
MARTINEZ: <i>I'd like you to know</i>

16
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,947
<i>that visual inspection
of the equipment...</i>

17
00:02:36,147 --> 00:02:37,648
<i>is imperative to mission success.</i>

18

<i>I also would like to report
that the MAV is still upright.</i>

LEWIS: (SIGHS) <i>Watney,</i>

20
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:43,154
<i>you keep leaving your channel open...</i>

00:02:43,354 --> 00:02:45,124
<i>which leads to Martinez responding...</i>

22
00:02:45,324 --> 00:02:46,492
<i>which leads to all of us listening...</i>

23
00:02:46,692 --> 00:02:48,126
<i>which leads to me being annoyed.</i>

24

would like you to please...</i>

(LAUGHING)

28
00:02:53,932 --> 00:02:55,301
We'd prefer to use a different adjective

29
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:57,337
- to describe Martinez's mouth.

WATNEY: <i>"Dr. Beck." And yes.</i>

32
00:03:01,372 --> 00:03:03,576
Happy to turn the radios
off from here, Commander.

33

Just say the word.

34

Wait, Johanssen.

48

What is it?

49
00:03:33,205 --> 00:03:34,273
JOHANSSEN: <i>A storm warning.</i>

50
00:03:34,473 --> 00:03:35,774
LEWIS: I saw that in
this morning's briefing.

51
00:03:35,974 --> 00:03:37,844
We'll be inside before it hits.

52
00:03:38,044 --> 00:03:40,813
Yeah, they upgraded their estimate.

53
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:42,882
The storm's gonna be a lot worse.

54
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:51,391
LEWIS: <i>Martinez, how does it look?</i>

55
00:03:52,157 --> 00:03:53,760

7,500.

62
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:11,543
MARTINEZ: <i>Anything more than
that and the MAV could tip.</i>

63
00:04:11,743 --> 00:04:12,945
Do we scrub?

We could wait it out.

67

WATNEY: Let's wait it out.

68

JOHANSSEN: Commander?

70

How?

91
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:37,094
Use the cables from the

<i>roughly 50 days to complete.</i>

495

I have doubled my battery life

But if I use the heater...

505
00:36:49,298 --> 00:36:53,905
I will burn through half
my battery every day.

506
00:36:55,271 --> 00:36:59,176

Of course there are other ways...

...the Taiyang Shen booster.
Our engineers have run the numbers,

and it has enough fuel for
a Mars injection orbit.

1148
01:20:56,866 --> 01:20:58,462
Why hasn't NASA approached us?

They don't know.

Our booster technology is classified.

But "Elrond"?

1186

Because it's a secret meeting.

How do you know that?

1188

I'm sorry, what's your name again?

Teddy. I'm the Director of NASA.

1210
01:24:01,695 --> 01:24:03,964
Cool. Teddy, you're Earth.

1211
01:24:04,164 --> 01:24:06,299
And right now, the <i>Hermes</i>
is headed towards you...

1212
01:24:06,499 --> 01:24:08,770
starting its month-long
deceleration to intercept.

1213
01:24:08,970 --> 01:24:11,239
But instead, what I'm proposing is...

1214
01:24:11,439 --> 01:24:13,675
(WHOOSHING)

1215
01:24:15,443 --> 01:24:17,677
we start accelerating immediately

1216
01:24:17,877 --> 01:24:19,614
to preserve velocity and gain even more.

1217
01:24:19,814 --> 01:24:20,681
We don't intercept with Earth at all...

1218
01:24:20,881 --> 01:24:22,181
but we come close enough

1219
01:24:22,381 --> 01:24:24,485
to get a gravity assist and adjust course.

1220
01:24:24,685 --> 01:24:26,888
While we're doing that...

1221
01:24:28,721 --> 01:24:30,391
we resupply with the probe...

1222
01:24:30,591 --> 01:24:31,659
VINCENT: The <i>Taiyang Shen.</i>

1223
01:24:31,859 --> 01:24:33,293
...pick up whatever provisions we need...

1224
01:24:33,493 --> 01:24:35,396
and now we're accelerating towards Mars.

You're Mars.

1227

Now, we're going too fast

1228
01:24:40,967 --> 01:24:42,535
at this point to fall into orbit...

1229
01:24:42,735 --> 01:24:43,971
but we can do a flyby.

1230
01:24:44,171 --> 01:24:45,172
<i>What good is a flyby</i>

1231
01:24:45,372 --> 01:24:47,173
<i>if we can't get Watney off the surface?</i>

1232
01:24:47,373 --> 01:24:50,043
Watney would intercept using the MAV.

1233
01:24:50,243 --> 01:24:51,780
Ow!

1234
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:54,049
(WHOOSHING)

1235
01:24:54,948 --> 01:24:56,683
And then we just head home.

1237
01:25:01,355 --> 01:25:04,059
I've done the math. It checks out.

01:25:05,391 --> 01:25:06,660
- SANDERS: <i>Rich.
- Yes, sir.</i>

1239
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:07,727
Get out.

1240
01:25:07,927 --> 01:25:09,598
All right.

1241
01:25:15,636 --> 01:25:17,338
- Is he right?
- VINCENT: Yeah.

1242
01:25:17,538 --> 01:25:19,940
SANDERS: Bruce, what do you think?

1243
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:22,009
<i>Well, if Vincent says so.</i>

1244
01:25:23,109 --> 01:25:25,046
We need to use the <i>Taiyang Shen?</i>

1245
01:25:25,246 --> 01:25:26,446
VINCENT: Uh-huh.

1246
01:25:26,646 --> 01:25:28,582
What am I missing? Why is that important?

1247
01:25:28,782 --> 01:25:30,116
Because we can only do one.

1248
01:25:30,316 --> 01:25:32,352
Send Watney enough food to
last till <i>Ares 4...</i>

1249
01:25:32,552 --> 01:25:35,021
or send <i>Hermes</i>
back to get him right now.

1250
01:25:35,221 --> 01:25:36,056
Both plans require the <i>Taiyang Shen,</i>

1251
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:38,359
so we have to choose.

1252
01:25:38,559 --> 01:25:39,994
But what about the <i>Hermes</i> crew?

1253
01:25:40,194 --> 01:25:41,861
We'd be asking them to add

1254
01:25:42,061 --> 01:25:45,365
533 extra days to their mission.

1255
01:25:45,565 --> 01:25:47,606
Yeah. They wouldn't
hesitate, not for a second.

1256
01:25:48,368 --> 01:25:50,003
Can the <i>Hermes</i> function for 533 days

1257
01:25:50,203 --> 01:25:51,205
beyond the scheduled mission end?

1258
01:25:51,405 --> 01:25:52,373
It should.

1259
01:25:52,573 --> 01:25:54,542
Built to last the full <i>Ares</i> mission...

1260
01:25:54,742 --> 01:25:57,144
so technically, it's only
halfway through its lifespan.

1261
01:25:57,344 --> 01:25:58,546
But if something goes wrong...

1262
01:25:58,746 --> 01:26:00,381
Then we lose the crew.

1263
01:26:00,581 --> 01:26:01,882
BRUCE: <i>So what? We
either have a high chance</i>

1264
01:26:02,082 --> 01:26:04,051
<i>of killing one person...</i>

1265
01:26:04,251 --> 01:26:06,654
<i>or a low chance of killing six people.</i>

1266
01:26:06,854 --> 01:26:08,055
<i>How do we make that decision?</i>

1267
01:26:08,255 --> 01:26:09,757
We don't have to make it, Bruce.

1268
01:26:09,957 --> 01:26:11,491
He does.

1269
01:26:11,691 --> 01:26:12,994
MITCH: Yeah, well, bullshit.

1270
01:26:13,194 --> 01:26:14,995
It should be Commander Lewis' call.

1271
01:26:15,195 --> 01:26:16,830
We still have a chance to bring

1272
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:18,365
five astronauts home safe and sound.

1273
01:26:18,565 --> 01:26:20,669
I'm not risking their lives.

1274
01:26:21,268 --> 01:26:23,304
Let them make that decision.

1275
01:26:23,837 --> 01:26:26,807
Mitch, we're going with option one.

1276
01:26:28,175 --> 01:26:30,745
You goddamn coward.

1277
01:26:48,496 --> 01:26:51,265
- VOGEL: <i>Johanssen?
- Yeah.</i>

1278
01:26:51,465 --> 01:26:53,700
I know it's your private time.
Can I bother you for a second?

1279
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:54,735
JOHANSSEN: <i>Yeah, go ahead.</i>

1280
01:26:54,935 --> 01:26:55,602
VOGEL: <i>Where are you?</i>

1281
01:26:55,802 --> 01:26:57,304
The gym.

1282
01:27:13,087 --> 01:27:14,856
(BEEPS)

1283
01:27:15,823 --> 01:27:17,725
(PANTING)

1284
01:27:18,725 --> 01:27:20,061
What's up?

1285
01:27:20,261 --> 01:27:21,262
I just got an email from my wife

1286
01:27:21,462 --> 01:27:24,431
and the subject line says, "Our children."

1287
01:27:24,631 --> 01:27:27,001
My computer won't open the attachment.

1288
01:27:27,835 --> 01:27:29,035
Okay.

1289
01:27:29,235 --> 01:27:30,938
Let's take a look.

1290
01:27:34,408 --> 01:27:35,977
Uh...

1291
01:27:36,877 --> 01:27:38,346
Let's see.

1292
01:27:40,212 --> 01:27:42,516
This isn't a JPEG.

1293
01:27:42,716 --> 01:27:45,487
It's a plain ASCII text file.

1294
01:27:48,188 --> 01:27:50,069
I don't really know what we're looking at.

1295
01:27:51,158 --> 01:27:52,827
Does that make any sense to you?

1296
01:27:54,761 --> 01:27:57,065
"Rich Purnell Maneuver."

1297
01:27:57,265 --> 01:28:00,234
It's a course maneuver for the <i>Hermes.</i>

1298
01:28:05,506 --> 01:28:07,741
And the mission concludes
with Earth intercept,

1299
01:28:07,941 --> 01:28:09,376
211 days later.

1300
01:28:10,444 --> 01:28:12,279
MARTINEZ: Would it work?

1301
01:28:12,479 --> 01:28:14,214
LEWIS: Mmm-hmm. We ran the
numbers. They check out.

1302
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:15,850
BECK: It's a brilliant course.

1303
01:28:16,050 --> 01:28:18,986
So why all the cloak and dagger?

1304
01:28:19,186 --> 01:28:20,788
Because it goes directly
against NASA's decision.

1305
01:28:20,988 --> 01:28:22,957
Yeah. If we do the maneuver,

1306
01:28:23,157 --> 01:28:25,159
they'd have to send the
supply ship or we die.

1307
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:28,897
We have the opportunity
to force their hand.

1308
01:28:29,462 --> 01:28:32,299
So, are we gonna do it?

1309
01:28:33,432 --> 01:28:35,235
If it was up to me, we'd
already be on our way.

1310
01:28:35,435 --> 01:28:37,872
But it is, though, isn't it? Up to you.

1311
01:28:38,072 --> 01:28:39,239
(CHUCKLES) Not this time.

1312
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:42,577
This is something NASA expressly rejected.

1313
01:28:43,176 --> 01:28:44,945
We're talking about mutiny here,

1314
01:28:45,145 --> 01:28:46,413
which is not a word that I take lightly.

1315
01:28:46,613 --> 01:28:49,283
So we do this together or not at all.

1316
01:28:49,483 --> 01:28:52,418
And before you answer,
consider the consequences.

1317
01:28:52,618 --> 01:28:55,522
If we mess up the supply
rendezvous, we die.

1318
01:28:55,722 --> 01:28:58,424
If we mess up the Earth
gravity assist, we die.

1319
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:01,628
If we do everything perfectly...

1320
01:29:01,828 --> 01:29:05,098
we add 533 days to our mission.

1321
01:29:05,298 --> 01:29:09,070
533 more days before we
see our families again.

1322
01:29:09,270 --> 01:29:13,707
533 days of unplanned space travel...

1323
01:29:13,907 --> 01:29:15,342
where anything could go wrong.

1324
01:29:15,542 --> 01:29:19,314
If it's mission critical, we die.

1325
01:29:19,747 --> 01:29:20,881
Sign me up.

1326
01:29:21,081 --> 01:29:22,315
All right, cowboy, slow down.

1327
01:29:22,515 --> 01:29:24,452
You and I, we're military.

1328
01:29:24,652 --> 01:29:25,953
Chances are, we go home,
they'll court martial us.

1329
01:29:26,153 --> 01:29:27,154
Yeah, there's that.

1330
01:29:27,354 --> 01:29:28,588
LEWIS: And for the rest of you guys...

1331
01:29:28,788 --> 01:29:31,491
I guarantee they will never
send you back up here again.

1332
01:29:31,691 --> 01:29:36,062
Good. So, if we go for
it, how would it work?

1333
01:29:36,262 --> 01:29:37,698
I plot the course and execute it.

1334
01:29:37,898 --> 01:29:39,199
JOHANSSEN: Remote override.

1335
01:29:39,399 --> 01:29:40,266
They could take over the <i>Hermes</i>

1336
01:29:40,466 --> 01:29:42,202
from Mission Control.

1337
01:29:43,037 --> 01:29:45,172
LEWIS: Can you disable it?

1338
01:29:45,372 --> 01:29:47,341
<i>Hermes</i> has four
redundant flight computers...

1339
01:29:47,541 --> 01:29:49,776
each connected to three
redundant comm systems.

1340
01:29:49,976 --> 01:29:51,111
We can't shut down the comms

1341
01:29:51,311 --> 01:29:52,646
because we'd lose telemetry and guidance.

1342
01:29:52,846 --> 01:29:54,381
And we can't shut down the computers

1343
01:29:54,581 --> 01:29:56,316
because we need to run the ship.

1344
01:29:56,516 --> 01:29:59,787
I'd have to disable remote
override on each system.

1345
01:29:59,987 --> 01:30:01,821
It's part of the OS, I'd
have to jump over the code.

1346
01:30:02,021 --> 01:30:04,992
Okay, but, like, in English,
what would that mean?

1347
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:08,228
I can do it.

1348
01:30:08,729 --> 01:30:10,265
Great.

1349
01:30:11,532 --> 01:30:13,401
Well, it has to be unanimous.

1350
01:30:13,934 --> 01:30:18,973
If we do this, it'll be
over 900 days of space.

1351
01:30:20,907 --> 01:30:24,744
That's more than enough
space for one life...

1352
01:30:24,944 --> 01:30:26,614
so, yes.

1353
01:30:26,814 --> 01:30:28,549
I vote yes.

1354
01:30:30,417 --> 01:30:32,420

1367

Guidance, get a correction ready.

it's not drift. They've adjusted course.

1370

What the hell?

1371
01:31:02,615 --> 01:31:05,619

is instrumentation failure?

Negative, Flight.

1373
01:31:07,554 --> 01:31:08,489

Working on that now, Flight.

1376

(WHISPERS) Hey. Who's Rich Purnell?

1377
01:31:14,127 --> 01:31:15,896
I dunno.

1378
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:18,632
Will somebody find out who
the hell Rich Purnell is?

1379
01:31:18,832 --> 01:31:20,534
SANDERS: Annie will go before
the media this morning...

1380
01:31:20,734 --> 01:31:22,270
and inform them of NASA's decision

1381
01:31:22,470 --> 01:31:25,204
to reroute the <i>Hermes</i> to Mars.

1382
01:31:25,404 --> 01:31:27,441
Sounds like a smart move.

1383
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:30,910
Considering the circumstances.

1384
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:35,515
Whoever gave them the maneuver
only passed along information.

1385

Crew made the decision on their own.

1386
01:31:39,319 --> 01:31:41,456
You may have killed them, Mitch.

1387
01:31:43,288 --> 01:31:45,092
We're fighting the same war.

1388
01:31:45,292 --> 01:31:46,427
Every time something goes wrong,

1389
01:31:46,627 --> 01:31:48,294
the world forgets why we fly.

1390
01:31:48,494 --> 01:31:50,064
I'm trying to keep us airborne.

1391
01:31:50,264 --> 01:31:52,466
It's bigger than one person.

1392
01:31:54,001 --> 01:31:55,570
No.

1393
01:31:55,770 --> 01:31:57,205
It's not.

1394
01:31:58,204 --> 01:32:02,109
When this is over, I'll
expect your resignation.

1395
01:32:05,045 --> 01:32:06,347
I understand.

1396
01:32:06,547 --> 01:32:09,350
Bring our astronauts home.

1397
01:32:12,319 --> 01:32:14,922
Every <i>Ares</i> mission requires
three years of pre-supplies.

1398
01:32:15,122 --> 01:32:17,591
So NASA decided a long time
ago it's a lot easier...

1399
01:32:17,791 --> 01:32:19,025
to send some of the stuff beforehand

1400
01:32:19,225 --> 01:32:20,461
rather than bring it with us.

1401
01:32:20,661 --> 01:32:24,065
So, as a result, the MAV for <i>Ares 4...</i>

1402
01:32:24,265 --> 01:32:25,432
is already there

1403
01:32:25,632 --> 01:32:27,601
at the Schiaparelli Crater, just waiting.

1404
01:32:27,801 --> 01:32:31,338
So the plan is for me to
use that to go into orbit...

1405
01:32:31,538 --> 01:32:34,374
just as the <i>Hermes</i> is passing...

1406
01:32:34,574 --> 01:32:38,245
and I guess they catch me?

1407
01:32:38,845 --> 01:32:40,814
In space.

1408
01:32:43,783 --> 01:32:46,020
So, I've got 200 sols to figure out...

1409
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:48,855
how to take everything here
that's keeping me alive...

1410

What's the intercept plan?

1674
01:50:38,157 --> 01:50:40,292
We finished attaching the
tethers into one long line.

1675
01:50:40,492 --> 01:50:42,395
It's 214 meters long.

1676
01:50:42,595 --> 01:50:43,663
And I'll have the MMU,

1677

so moving around should be easy.

How fast a relative
velocity can you handle?

1679
01:50:48,533 --> 01:50:50,903
I can grab the MAV at 5 meters per second.

Well, we may have some leeway.

And it'll be 52 minutes before intercept.

1685

we'll know our intercept
point and velocity.

01:57:46,518 --> 01:57:47,552

<i>with the transmission.</i>

1794
01:57:56,360 --> 01:57:58,097
JOHANSSEN: <i>I have interval pings.</i>

1795
01:57:58,297 --> 01:57:59,931
Intercept velocity will
be 11 meters per second.

1796
01:58:00,131 --> 01:58:02,301
I can make that work.

1797
01:58:02,835 --> 01:58:05,137
JOHANSSEN: Distance at intercept will be...

1798
01:58:05,337 --> 01:58:07,373
We'll be 68 kilometers apart.

1799

BECK: <i>68 kilometers?</i>

1800

<i>Did she just say 68 kilometers?</i>

1801
01:58:12,944 --> 01:58:13,611
Come on, guys, keep it together.

1802
01:58:13,811 --> 01:58:15,214
Work the problem.

1803
01:58:15,646 --> 01:58:17,815
Johanssen, time to intercept?

1804
01:58:18,015 --> 01:58:20,186
JOHANSSEN: <i>39 minutes, 12 seconds.</i>

1805
01:58:20,618 --> 01:58:21,820
Martinez, what if we point our thrusters

1806
01:58:22,020 --> 01:58:23,622
in the same direction?

1807
01:58:23,822 --> 01:58:26,892
Well, it depends how much
fuel you wanna save...

1808
01:58:27,092 --> 01:58:28,025
for the altitude adjustments
for the trip home.

1809
01:58:28,225 --> 01:58:29,427
How much do you need?

1810
01:58:29,627 --> 01:58:34,199
I can get by with about
20% of what we have left.

1811
01:58:35,167 --> 01:58:38,236
If we use 75.5% of remaining
altitude-adjust fuel...

1812
01:58:38,436 --> 01:58:40,105
that will bring the
intercept range to zero.

1813
01:58:40,305 --> 01:58:41,773
Do it.

1814
01:58:42,307 --> 01:58:45,511
Hang on. It brings the range to zero...

1815
01:58:45,711 --> 01:58:48,113
but the intercept velocity
will be 42 meters per second.

1816
01:58:48,313 --> 01:58:50,382
<i>And that's way too fast.</i>

1817
01:58:50,582 --> 01:58:52,383
Then we'll have 39 minutes to figure out

1818
01:58:52,583 --> 01:58:54,387
how to slow down.

1819
01:58:57,122 --> 01:58:58,824

<i>There was a complication during launch.</i>

1831
01:59:41,167 --> 01:59:42,901
Copy that.

1832
01:59:43,101 --> 01:59:44,936
How bad is it?

1833
01:59:45,136 --> 01:59:46,439
LEWIS: <i>We've corrected
the intercept range,</i>

1834
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:48,574
<i>but we've got a problem
with intercept velocity.</i>

1835
01:59:48,774 --> 01:59:49,842
WATNEY: <i>How big a problem?</i>

1836
01:59:50,042 --> 01:59:51,610
42 meters a second.

1837
01:59:51,810 --> 01:59:53,312
Well...

1838
01:59:54,046 --> 01:59:56,115
shit.

1839
02:00:00,786 --> 02:00:02,488
<i>Commander, I have an idea.</i>

1840
02:00:02,688 --> 02:00:04,222
LEWIS: <i>Go ahead, Mark.</i>

1841
02:00:04,422 --> 02:00:07,458
Well, if I can find
something sharp in here...

1842
02:00:07,658 --> 02:00:10,463
and poke a hole in the
glove of my EVA suit...

1843
02:00:10,663 --> 02:00:12,931
I could use the escaping
air as a thruster...

1844
02:00:13,131 --> 02:00:14,665
<i>and fly towards you.</i>

1845
02:00:14,865 --> 02:00:18,136
<i>It would be easy to control
because it would be on my arm.</i>

1846
02:00:18,336 --> 02:00:19,972
LEWIS: I can't see you having
any control if you did that.

1847
02:00:20,172 --> 02:00:21,906
You'd be eyeballing the intercept

1848
02:00:22,106 --> 02:00:24,342
using a thrust vector
you can barely control.

1849
02:00:24,542 --> 02:00:28,079
Yes, those are all very good points.

1850
02:00:28,279 --> 02:00:31,450
But consider this.

1851
02:00:33,318 --> 02:00:35,753
I'd get to fly around like Iron Man.

Maybe it's not the worst idea.

1858
02:00:51,002 --> 02:00:52,671
No, it is the worst idea.
It's the worst idea ever.

1859
02:00:52,871 --> 02:00:53,972
Not what he said.

1860
02:00:54,172 --> 02:00:56,776
Using atmosphere as thrust.

1861
02:00:58,577 --> 02:01:00,579
What happens if we blow the VAL?

1862
02:01:00,779 --> 02:01:02,614
Wait, you want to open
the vehicular airlock?

1863
02:01:02,814 --> 02:01:03,949
It'll give us a good kick.

1864
02:01:04,149 --> 02:01:06,017
But also blow the nose off the ship.

1865
02:01:06,217 --> 02:01:08,921
And all the air would leave
and we need air to not die.

1866
02:01:09,121 --> 02:01:11,156
We would seal the bridge
and the reactor room.

1867

Probably.

02:01:27,337 --> 02:01:28,573
But I feel obliged to mention

1876

Absolutely not.
