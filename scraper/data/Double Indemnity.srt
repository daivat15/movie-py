Why, hello there,
Mr. Neff.

7
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:48,019
Working pretty late, aren't you,
Mr. Neff? Late enough. Let's ride.

8
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:54,275
You look kind of all
in, at that. I'm fine.

9
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:57,820
How is the insurance
business, Mr. Neff? Okay.

10
00:02:58,696 --> 00:03:00,490
They wouldn't ever
sell me any.

11
00:03:00,573 --> 00:03:02,283

Walter Neff to Barton Keyes,
Claims Manager.

21
00:05:10,707 --> 00:05:12,918
Los Angeles, July 16, 1938.

22
00:05:14,878 --> 00:05:16,380
Dear Keyes...

23
00:05:17,965 --> 00:05:20,968
I suppose you'll call this
a confession when you hear it.

24
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:23,387
Well, I don't like
the word confession.

25
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,597
I just want to set you right
about something you couldn't see...

26
00:05:25,681 --> 00:05:27,349
because it was smack up
against your nose.

27
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:30,644
You think you're such a hot
potato as a Claims Manager...

28
00:05:30,728 --> 00:05:32,897
such a wolf on a phony claim.

29
00:05:34,023 --> 00:05:37,902
Maybe you are, but let's take a
look at that Dietrichson claim.

30
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,322
Accident and double indemnity.

31
00:05:42,198 --> 00:05:45,368
You were pretty good in there
for a while, Keyes.

32
00:05:45,618 --> 00:05:48,246
You said it wasn't
an accident. Check.

33
00:05:48,663 --> 00:05:51,082
You said it wasn't suicide.
Check.

34
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:55,086
You said it was murder. Check.

35
00:05:57,255 --> 00:05:59,758
You thought you had it cold,
didn't you?

36
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:03,053
All wrapped up in tissue paper,
with pink ribbons around it.

37
00:06:03,094 --> 00:06:04,638
It was perfect.

38
00:06:05,263 --> 00:06:08,225
Except it wasn't, because
you made one mistake...

39
00:06:08,308 --> 00:06:10,227
just one little mistake.

40
00:06:11,436 --> 00:06:15,274
When it came to picking the
killer, you picked the wrong guy.

41
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:18,902
You want to know who
killed Dietrichson?

42
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,614
Hold tight to that
cheap cigar of yours, Keyes.

43
00:06:24,074 --> 00:06:25,618
I killed Dietrichson.

44
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:28,579
Me, Walter Neff,
insurance salesman.

45
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:31,791

47
00:06:37,505 --> 00:06:39,173
Yes, I killed him.

48
00:06:40,883 --> 00:06:42,927
I killed him for money...

49
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,595
and for a woman.

50
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:50,560
And I didn't get the money
and I didn't get the woman.

51
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,397

California Spanish houses...</i>

<i>everyone was nuts about
10 or 15 years ago.</i>

61
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:32,978
<i>This one must've cost somebody
about $30,000.</i>

62
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:35,523
<i>That is, if he ever
finished paying for it.</i>

Listen, Mr. Dietrichson is not
in. How soon do you expect him?

69

here, if that's any help to you.

73
00:07:58,254 --> 00:07:59,714
How do you do,
Mrs. Dietrichson?

74
00:07:59,798 --> 00:08:01,716
I'm Walter Neff,
Pacific All Risk.

75

Pacific all what? The Pacific
All Risk Insurance Company.

76
00:08:05,053 --> 00:08:07,013
It's about some renewals
on the automobiles.

77
00:08:07,097 --> 00:08:09,683
I've been trying to contact your
husband for the past two weeks...

78
00:08:09,725 --> 00:08:12,895
but he's never in his office.
Is there anything I can do?

79
00:08:12,978 --> 00:08:14,479
The insurance ran out
on the 15th.

80
00:08:14,563 --> 00:08:16,690
I'd hate to think of your
having a smashed fender...

what you mean, Mr. Neff.

84

I've just been taking a sunbath.
No pigeons around, I hope.

85
00:08:28,077 --> 00:08:31,205
About those policies, Mrs. Dietrichson,
I hate to take up your time, but...

86
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:32,623
Oh, that's all right.

87
00:08:32,707 --> 00:08:35,209

something on, I'll be right down.

Nettie, show Mr. Neff
into the living room.

89
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,175
Where would
the living room be?

90
00:08:42,258 --> 00:08:44,677
In there, but they keep
the liquor locked up.

91

frames, were Mr. Dietrichson and Lola...</i>

by his first wife.</i>

99
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:15,751

little red goldfish...</i>

<i>But to tell you
the truth, Keyes...</i>

102
00:09:19,713 --> 00:09:22,758
<i>I wasn't a whole lot interested
in goldfish right then.</i>

103
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,762
<i>Or in auto renewals, or in Mr.
Dietrichson and his daughter Lola.</i>

104
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:30,766
<i>I was thinking about that dame upstairs,
and the way she had looked at me...</i>

105
00:09:30,808 --> 00:09:33,519
<i>and I wanted
to see her again, close...</i>

106
00:09:33,603 --> 00:09:36,314
<i>without that silly staircase
between us.</i>

107
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:44,030
I wasn't long, was I? (Walter)
Not at all, Mrs. Dietrichson.

108
00:09:44,113 --> 00:09:47,617
Hope I've got my face on straight.
It's perfect, for my money.

109
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:49,119
Neff is the name, isn't it?
Yeah.

110
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,454

Philadelphia, if you know the story.

111
00:09:51,538 --> 00:09:54,124
<i>What story?
The Philadelphia Story.</i>

112
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:56,334
Suppose we sit down and you
tell me about the insurance.

113
00:09:56,418 --> 00:09:58,920
My husband never
tells me anything.

114
00:09:59,004 --> 00:10:02,340
Well, it's on your two cars,
the LaSalle and the Plymouth.

115
00:10:03,842 --> 00:10:06,803
We've been handling this insurance
for Mr. Dietrichson for three years...

116
00:10:06,887 --> 00:10:09,431
and we'd hate to see
the policies lapse.

117
00:10:09,848 --> 00:10:13,644
That's a honey of an anklet
you're wearing, Mrs. Dietrichson.

118
00:10:13,852 --> 00:10:16,355
As I was saying, we'd hate
to see the policies lapse.

119
00:10:16,438 --> 00:10:19,233
Of course, we give them 30 days.
That's all we're allowed to give.

120
00:10:19,316 --> 00:10:21,819
I guess he's been too busy down
at Long Beach in the oil fields.

121
00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:24,071
Couldn't I catch him at home
some evening for a few minutes?

122
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:26,073
I suppose so. But he's
never home much before 8:00.

123
00:10:26,157 --> 00:10:27,491
That's fine with me.

124
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:29,577
You're not connected with
the Automobile Club, are you?

125
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,038
No, the All Risk,
Mrs. Dietrichson. Why?

126
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:35,082
Somebody from the Automobile
Club has been trying to get him.

127
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:38,002
Do they have a better rate?
If your husband's a member.

128
00:10:38,044 --> 00:10:39,128
No, he isn't.

129
00:10:39,212 --> 00:10:42,340
Well, then he'd have to join the club
and pay the membership fee to start with.

130
00:10:42,423 --> 00:10:45,134
I never knock the other fellow's
merchandise, Mrs. Dietrichson.

131
00:10:45,218 --> 00:10:49,180
The Automobile Club's fine. I can
do just as well for you, though.

132
00:10:49,222 --> 00:10:51,433
I have a very attractive
policy here.

133
00:10:51,516 --> 00:10:54,185
It wouldn't take me two minutes
to put it in front of your husband.

134
00:10:54,227 --> 00:10:56,813
For instance, we're writing a new
kind of 50% retention feature...

135
00:10:56,897 --> 00:10:58,899
in the collision coverage.

136
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:01,902
You're a smart insurance man,
aren't you, Mr. Neff?

137
00:11:01,943 --> 00:11:04,529
Well, I've been at it 11
years. Doing pretty well?

138
00:11:04,571 --> 00:11:05,948
It's a living.

139
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:10,244
You handle just automobile
insurance, or all kinds?

140
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:13,747
All kinds. Fire, earthquake, theft,
public liability, group insurance...

141
00:11:13,831 --> 00:11:16,250
industrial stuff and so on,
right down the line.

142
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:17,668
Accident insurance?

143
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:19,962
Accident insurance?
Sure, Mrs. Dietrichson.

144
00:11:20,087 --> 00:11:21,046
[Chuckles]

145
00:11:21,922 --> 00:11:25,092
Wish you'd tell me what's
engraved on that anklet.

146
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,054
Just my name.
As, for instance?

147
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:31,390
Phyllis.
Phyllis, huh?

148
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,852
I think I like that.
But you're not sure?

149
00:11:34,936 --> 00:11:38,064
I'd have to drive it around
the block a couple of times.

150
00:11:38,147 --> 00:11:40,900
Mr. Neff, why don't you drop
by tomorrow evening around 8:30?

151
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:42,819
He'll be in then.
Who?

152
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:46,114
My husband. You were anxious
to talk to him, weren't you?

153
00:11:46,197 --> 00:11:49,117
Yeah, I was, but I'm sort of
getting over the idea...

154
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,535
if you know what I mean.

155
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:54,039
There's a speed limit in this
state, Mr. Neff. 45 miles an hour.

156
00:11:54,122 --> 00:11:57,375
How fast was I going, officer?
I'd say around 90.

157
00:11:57,667 --> 00:12:00,087
Suppose you get down off your
motorcycle and give me a ticket.

158
00:12:00,128 --> 00:12:02,381
Suppose I let you off
with a warning this time.

159
00:12:02,464 --> 00:12:04,174
Suppose it doesn't take.

160
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:06,635
Suppose I have to whack you
over the knuckles.

161
00:12:06,677 --> 00:12:09,596
Suppose I bust out crying and
put my head on your shoulder.

162
00:12:09,638 --> 00:12:12,766
Suppose you try putting it
on my husband's shoulder.

163
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,351
That tears it.

164
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:22,026
8:30 tomorrow evening then.
That's what I suggested.

165
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:24,779
Will you be here, too?
I guess so, I usually am.

166
00:12:24,862 --> 00:12:27,156
Same chair, same perfume,
same anklet?

167
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,283
I wonder if I know
what you mean.

168
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:32,161
I wonder if you wonder.

169
00:12:35,832 --> 00:12:38,251
<i>(Walter) It was a hot afternoon
and I can still remember...</i>

170
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:41,254
<i>the smell of honeysuckle
all along that street.</i>

171
00:12:41,337 --> 00:12:45,550
<i>How could I have known that murder
can sometimes smell like honeysuckle?</i>

172
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:46,801
<i>Maybe you would
have known, Keyes...</i>

173
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:50,513
<i>the minute she mentioned
accident insurance, but I didn't.</i>

174
00:12:50,597 --> 00:12:52,474
<i>I felt like a million.</i>

175
00:12:53,183 --> 00:12:56,436
<i>I went back to the office
to see if I had any mail.</i>

176
00:12:56,686 --> 00:12:59,815
<i>It was the day you had that truck
driver from Inglewood on the carpet.</i>

177
00:12:59,856 --> 00:13:01,191
<i>Remember, Keyes?</i>

178
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:03,652
Mr. Neff, Mr. Keyes
wants to see you.

179
00:13:03,694 --> 00:13:05,612
He's been yelling for you
all afternoon.

180
00:13:05,696 --> 00:13:07,656
Is he sore, or just frothing
at the mouth a little?

181
00:13:07,698 --> 00:13:09,742
Park this for me,
will you, sweetheart?

182
00:13:14,371 --> 00:13:16,248
Hello, Walter.
Hi, George.

183
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,502
Come on. Come on, Garlopis.

184
00:13:19,543 --> 00:13:21,420
You're not kidding anybody
with that line of bull.

185
00:13:21,504 --> 00:13:23,547
You're in a jam and
you know it. Says you.

186
00:13:23,631 --> 00:13:25,841
All I want is my money. Says you.

187
00:13:25,925 --> 00:13:28,553
All you're gonna get
is the cops. Hello, Walter.

188
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:31,806
This is Sam Garlopis from
Inglewood. Sure, I know Mr. Garlopis.

189
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:34,809
Wrote a policy on his truck.
How are you, Mr. Garlopis?

190
00:13:34,892 --> 00:13:39,147
I ain't so good. My truck burned
down. Yeah. Now look, Garlopis.

191
00:13:39,898 --> 00:13:42,400
Every month hundreds of claims
come to this desk.

192
00:13:42,442 --> 00:13:44,736
Some of them are phonies,
and I know which ones.

193
00:13:44,819 --> 00:13:47,822
How do I know? Because
my little man tells me.

194
00:13:49,074 --> 00:13:51,910
What little man?
The little man in here.

195
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,205
Every time one of these phonies comes
along, it ties knots in my stomach.

196
00:13:55,288 --> 00:13:56,748
I can't eat.

197
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:00,043
Yours is one of them, Garlopis. That's
how I knew your claim was crooked.

198
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:01,628
So what did I do?

199
00:14:01,712 --> 00:14:04,298
I sent a tow car over to your
garage this afternoon...

200
00:14:04,381 --> 00:14:06,258
and they jacked up that
burned-out truck of yours.

201
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,843
And what did they find?

202
00:14:07,926 --> 00:14:11,221
They found what was left
of a neat pile of shavings.

203
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,848
What shavings?

204
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:16,477
The ones you soaked with
kerosene and dropped a match on.

205
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:22,233
Look, Mister, I'm just a poor
guy. Maybe I made a mistake.

206
00:14:22,525 --> 00:14:24,610
That's one way
of putting it.

207
00:14:24,694 --> 00:14:26,904
I ain't feeling so good,
Mr. Keyes.

208
00:14:26,988 --> 00:14:29,240
Here. Just a minute. Sign
this and you'll feel fine.

209
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:32,160
Sign what? It's a waiver
on your claim. Right here.

210
00:14:33,411 --> 00:14:34,787
Here?
Here.

211
00:14:38,374 --> 00:14:41,544
Now you're an honest man
again. Goodbye, Garlopis.

212
00:14:41,628 --> 00:14:43,546
But I ain't got no more truck.

213
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,007
$2,600 is lot of dough
where I live.

214
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:48,593
What's the matter, Garlopis, don't
you know how to open the door?

215
00:14:48,635 --> 00:14:51,930
Just put your hand on the
knob, turn it to the left.

216
00:14:52,806 --> 00:14:54,808
Now pull it toward you.

217
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,563
That's the boy.
Thank you, Mr. Keyes.

218
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:05,194
What kind of an outfit
is this, anyway?

219
00:15:05,277 --> 00:15:07,988
Are we an insurance company, or
just a bunch of dimwitted amateurs...

220
00:15:08,072 --> 00:15:09,281
to write a policy
on a mug like that?

221
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:10,991
Now, wait a minute, Keyes.
I don't rate this beef.

222
00:15:11,075 --> 00:15:12,618
I clipped a note to that
Garlopis application...

223
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:13,702
to have him
thoroughly investigated...

224
00:15:13,786 --> 00:15:15,496
before we accepted the risk.
I know you did, Walter.

225
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:18,249
I'm not beefing at you. It's the
company. It's the way they do things.

226
00:15:18,332 --> 00:15:19,417
The way they don't do things!

227
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,211
The way they'll write anything just
to get it down on the sales sheet.

228
00:15:22,295 --> 00:15:24,797
And I'm the guy that has to sit
here up to my neck in phony claims...

229
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,800
so they won't throw more money out the
window than they take in at the door.

230
00:15:27,842 --> 00:15:29,677
Okay, turn the record over,
let's hear the other side.

231
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:33,097
Well, I get darn sick of trying to pick
up after a gang of fast-talking salesmen...

232
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:34,849
dumb enough to sell
life insurance to a guy...

233
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:36,810
who sleeps in the same bed
with four rattlesnakes.

234
00:15:36,851 --> 00:15:39,479
Walter, I've had 26 years of this
and let me tell you, I'm getting...

235
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,523
Yeah, and you've loved
every minute of it, Keyes.

236
00:15:41,564 --> 00:15:45,402
You love it, only you worry about it
too darn much, you and your little man.

237
00:15:45,485 --> 00:15:47,821
You're so darn conscientious,
you're driving yourself crazy.

238
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,615
You wouldn't even say today is Tuesday
unless you looked at the calendar.

239
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,285
Then you'd check to see if it was
this year's or last year's calendar.

240
00:15:53,368 --> 00:15:54,745
Then you'd find out
who printed the calendar...

241
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,623
<i>and find out if their calendar checked
with the World Almanac's calendar.</i>

242
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,874
Now, that's enough
from you, Walter.

243
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:02,169
Now, get out of here
before I throw my desk at you.

244
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,547
[Flicking match]

245
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,216
I love you, too.

246
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,183
<i>(Walter) I really did,
too, you old crab...</i>

247
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:19,562
<i>always yelling your head off,
always sore at everybody.</i>

248
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,441
<i>But you never fooled me with your
song and dance. Not for a second.</i>

249
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,985
<i>I kind of always knew that behind
the cigar ashes on your vest...</i>

250
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,446
<i>you had a heart
as big as a house.</i>

251
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,699
<i>Back in my office there was a phone
message from Mrs. Dietrichson...</i>

252
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,493
<i>about the renewals.</i>

253
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,746
<i>She didn't want me to come
tomorrow evening.</i>

254
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:40,542
<i>She wanted me to come Thursday
afternoon at 3:30 instead.</i>

255
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:44,337
<i>I had a lot of stuff lined up
for that Thursday afternoon...</i>

256
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,381
<i>including a trip
down to Santa Monica...</i>

257
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:50,218
<i>to see a couple of live prospects
about some group insurance.</i>

258
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,388
<i>But I kept thinking
about Phyllis Dietrichson...</i>

259
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,974
<i>and the way that anklet
of hers cut into her leg.</i>

260
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,068
Hello, Mr. Neff.
Aren't you coming in?

261
00:17:06,986 --> 00:17:08,737
I'm considering it.

262
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:12,908
I hope you didn't mind
my changing the appointment.

263
00:17:12,992 --> 00:17:15,953
Last night wasn't so
convenient. That's all right.

264
00:17:16,037 --> 00:17:18,122
I was working on
my stamp collection anyway.

265
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:20,374
I was just fixing some iced
tea. Would you like a glass?

266
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,710
Yeah, unless you've got a bottle
of beer that's not working.

267
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:25,380
There may be some. I never
know what's in the icebox.

268
00:17:25,463 --> 00:17:26,631
Nettie.

269
00:17:30,677 --> 00:17:34,264
About those renewals, Mr. Neff.
I talked to my husband about it.

270
00:17:34,305 --> 00:17:37,058
Oh, you did? Yes. He'll
renew with you, he told me so.

271
00:17:37,142 --> 00:17:39,686
As a matter of fact, I thought
he'd be here this afternoon.

272
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:40,937
But he's not?
No.

273
00:17:40,979 --> 00:17:42,022
[Chuckles]

274
00:17:42,105 --> 00:17:43,690
That's terrible.

275
00:17:44,316 --> 00:17:46,318
Nettie!

276
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,696
Oh, I forgot,
today's the maid's day off.

277
00:17:50,781 --> 00:17:53,659
Never mind the beer.
Iced tea will be fine.

278
00:17:53,742 --> 00:17:56,036
Lemon? Sugar?
Fix it your way.

279
00:17:57,746 --> 00:18:01,291
As long as it's the maid's day off,
maybe there's something I can do for you.

280
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:04,545
Like running the vacuum cleaner. Fresh.

281
00:18:05,004 --> 00:18:07,423
I used to peddle
vacuum cleaners.

282
00:18:07,506 --> 00:18:09,425
Not much money, but you
learn a lot about life.

283
00:18:09,508 --> 00:18:13,179
I didn't think you'd learned
it from a correspondence course.

284
00:18:14,722 --> 00:18:16,974
Where'd you pick up
this tea drinking?

285
00:18:17,016 --> 00:18:19,227
You're not English, are you?
No. Californian.

286
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,354
Born right here
in Los Angeles.

287
00:18:21,437 --> 00:18:24,524
They say all native
Californians come from Iowa.

288
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,152
Mr. Neff, I...
Make it Walter, huh?

289
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:30,071
Walter.
That's right.

290
00:18:30,488 --> 00:18:34,868
Tell me, Walter, on this insurance,
how much commission do you make?

291
00:18:35,035 --> 00:18:36,536
Twenty percent. Why?

292
00:18:36,578 --> 00:18:39,205
I thought perhaps I could throw
a little more business your way.

293
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:41,875
I can always use it. I was
thinking about my husband.

294
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,377
I worry a lot about him
down in those oil fields.

295
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:46,713
It's very dangerous.
Not for an executive, is it?

296
00:18:46,797 --> 00:18:48,215
He doesn't just sit
behind a desk.

297
00:18:48,256 --> 00:18:50,550
He's right down there
with those drilling crews.

298
00:18:50,634 --> 00:18:51,843
It's got me worried sick.

299
00:18:51,927 --> 00:18:54,263
You mean, some dark night a
crown block might fall on him?

300
00:18:54,346 --> 00:18:56,807
Please don't talk like that.
But that's the idea.

301
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,852
The other day a casing line
snapped and caught the foreman.

302
00:18:59,935 --> 00:19:02,730
He's in the hospital with
a broken back. That's bad.

303
00:19:02,813 --> 00:19:05,316
It's got me jittery
just thinking about it.

304
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:07,610
Suppose something like that
happened to my husband.

305
00:19:07,693 --> 00:19:09,362
It could.
Well...

306
00:19:10,738 --> 00:19:14,033
don't you think he ought to
have accident insurance? Mmm-hmm.

307
00:19:15,076 --> 00:19:17,411
What kind of insurance
could he have?

308
00:19:17,495 --> 00:19:19,705
Enough to cover doctors
and hospital bills.

309
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:21,874
Say $125 a week cash benefit.

310
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,335
And he'd rate around
$50,000 capital sum.

311
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:27,672
Capital sum? What's that?
In case he gets killed.

312
00:19:28,464 --> 00:19:30,884
Maybe I shouldn't
have said that.

313
00:19:30,925 --> 00:19:33,303
I suppose you have to think
of everything in your business.

314
00:19:33,386 --> 00:19:34,763
Well, your husband
would understand.

315
00:19:34,846 --> 00:19:37,641
I'm sure I could sell him on the
idea of some accident protection.

316
00:19:37,724 --> 00:19:39,267
Why don't I talk
to him about it?

317
00:19:39,351 --> 00:19:41,520
You could try,
but he's pretty tough-going.

318
00:19:41,603 --> 00:19:43,688
They're all tough at first.

319
00:19:44,481 --> 00:19:45,732
He has a lot on his mind.

320
00:19:45,774 --> 00:19:47,526
He doesn't seem to want
to listen to anything...

321
00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:50,445
except maybe
a baseball game on the radio.

322
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:54,700
Sometimes we sit here all evening
and never say a word to each other.

323
00:19:54,783 --> 00:19:58,412
(Walter) Sounds pretty dull.
So, I just sit and knit.

324
00:19:59,788 --> 00:20:01,123
Is that what you
married him for?

325
00:20:01,207 --> 00:20:04,376
Maybe I like the way
his thumbs hold up the wool.

326
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:07,088
Anytime his thumbs
get tired...

327
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:09,548
Only, with me around,
you wouldn't have to knit.

328
00:20:09,632 --> 00:20:11,717
Wouldn't I? You bet
your life, you wouldn't.

329
00:20:14,804 --> 00:20:18,224
Wonder if a little rum
would get this up on its feet.

330
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:22,812
I want to ask you
something, Walter.

331
00:20:25,064 --> 00:20:28,651
Could I get an accident policy for
him without bothering him at all?

332
00:20:28,735 --> 00:20:29,778
How's that, again?

333
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:32,822
It would make it easier for you, too.
You wouldn't even have to talk to him.

334
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,407
I have a little
allowance of my own.

335
00:20:34,491 --> 00:20:37,661
I could pay for it and he
needn't know anything about it.

336
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:41,289
Why shouldn't he know?

337
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:43,792
Because he doesn't want
accident insurance.

338
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:47,796
He's superstitious about it. A lot
of people are. That's funny, isn't it?

339
00:20:47,838 --> 00:20:52,009
If there was a way to get it like
that, all the worry would be over.

340
00:20:52,968 --> 00:20:56,055
See what I mean, Walter?
Sure. I got good eyesight.

341
00:20:56,138 --> 00:20:58,849
You mean you want him to have
the policy without him knowing it.

342
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:01,977
And that means without the insurance
company knowing that he doesn't know it.

343
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:04,814
That's the setup, isn't it? Is
there anything wrong with it?

344
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:06,232
No, I think it's lovely.

345
00:21:06,315 --> 00:21:08,734
Then, if some dark, wet night,
that crown block did fall on him...

346
00:21:08,818 --> 00:21:09,860
What crown block?

347
00:21:09,944 --> 00:21:13,030
Only sometimes it can't quite make it
on its own, it has to have a little help.

348
00:21:13,114 --> 00:21:14,449
I don't know what
you're talking about.

349
00:21:14,532 --> 00:21:15,950
Of course, it doesn't have
to be a crown block.

350
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:19,120
It can be a car backing over him, or he
could fall out of the upstairs window.

351
00:21:19,203 --> 00:21:21,289
Any little thing like that,
just so it's a morgue job.

352
00:21:21,372 --> 00:21:23,583
Are you crazy?
Not that crazy.

353
00:21:25,668 --> 00:21:27,378
Goodbye, Mrs. Dietrichson.
What's the matter?

354
00:21:29,714 --> 00:21:32,342
Look, baby,
you can't get away with it.

355
00:21:34,219 --> 00:21:35,846
You want to knock him off,
don't you?

356
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:37,389
That's a horrible
thing to say.

357
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,723
What'd you think
I was, anyway?

358
00:21:38,807 --> 00:21:41,184
A guy that walks into a good
looking dame's front parlor and says:

359
00:21:41,226 --> 00:21:43,228
"Good afternoon, I sell
accident insurance on husbands.

360
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,521
"You got one that's been
around too long?

361
00:21:44,605 --> 00:21:46,273
"One you'd like to turn into
a little hard cash?

362
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:48,233
"Just give me a smile
and I'll help you collect. "

363
00:21:48,317 --> 00:21:51,987
Boy, what a dope you must think
I am. I think you're rotten.

364
00:21:52,071 --> 00:21:54,239
I think you're swell, so
long as I'm not your husband.

365
00:21:54,323 --> 00:21:57,243
Get out of here. You bet
I'll get out of here, baby.

366
00:21:57,326 --> 00:21:59,537
I'll get out of here,
but quick.

367
00:22:09,505 --> 00:22:11,924
<i>(Walter) So I let her have
it straight between the eyes.</i>

368
00:22:12,008 --> 00:22:14,552
<i>She didn't fool me
for a minute, not this time.</i>

369
00:22:14,761 --> 00:22:16,262
<i>I knew I had hold
of a red-hot poker...</i>

370
00:22:16,304 --> 00:22:19,057
<i>and the time to drop it was
before it burned my hand off.</i>

371
00:22:19,766 --> 00:22:23,686
<i>I stopped at a drive-in for a bottle of
beer, the one I had wanted all along...</i>

372
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:27,607
<i>only I wanted it worse now, to get rid
of the sour taste of her iced tea...</i>

373
00:22:27,691 --> 00:22:29,609
<i>and everything
that went with it.</i>

374
00:22:29,693 --> 00:22:32,863
<i>I didn't want to go back to the office
so I dropped by a bowling alley...</i>

375
00:22:32,946 --> 00:22:35,449
<i>at Third and Western
and rolled a few lines...</i>

376
00:22:35,532 --> 00:22:38,618
<i>to get my mind thinking about
something else for a while.</i>

377
00:22:39,453 --> 00:22:43,707
<i>I didn't feel like eating dinner when
I left, and I didn't feel like a show.</i>

378
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:47,169
<i>So, I drove home, put the car
away and went up to my apartment.</i>

379
00:22:49,004 --> 00:22:51,423
<i>It had begun to rain outside
and I watched it get dark...</i>

380
00:22:51,465 --> 00:22:53,550
<i>and didn't even
turn on the light.</i>

381
00:22:53,968 --> 00:22:55,427
<i>That didn't help me either.</i>

382
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,304
<i>I was all twisted up inside...</i>

383
00:22:57,388 --> 00:23:00,224
<i>and I was still holding on
to that red-hot poker.</i>

384
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:04,353
<i>And right then it came over me that I
hadn't walked out on anything at all.</i>

385
00:23:04,562 --> 00:23:06,898
<i>That the hook
was too strong...</i>

386
00:23:06,981 --> 00:23:09,525
<i>that this wasn't the end
between her and me.</i>

387
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,277
<i>It was only the beginning.</i>

388
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,361
[Doorbell ringing]

389
00:23:12,445 --> 00:23:16,783
<i>So at 8:00 the bell would ring and I'd
know who it was without even having to think.</i>

390
00:23:17,116 --> 00:23:19,786
<i>As if it was the most
natural thing in the world.</i>

391
00:23:23,498 --> 00:23:26,501
Hello. You forgot your hat
this afternoon.

392
00:23:27,294 --> 00:23:29,921
Did I? Don't you want me to bring it in?

393
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,756
Sure.

394
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,260
Put it on the chair.

395
00:23:43,977 --> 00:23:46,438
How'd you know where I live?
It's in the phone book.

396
00:23:47,314 --> 00:23:49,024
It's raining.
Yeah.

397
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:51,986
Peel off your coat
and sit down.

398
00:23:55,072 --> 00:23:56,157
Your husband out?

399
00:23:56,198 --> 00:23:58,200
Yes. Long Beach. They're
spudding in a new well.

400
00:23:58,284 --> 00:24:00,453
He phoned he'd be late.
About 9:30.

401
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,831
It's about time you said
you were glad to see me.

402
00:24:03,873 --> 00:24:05,333
I knew you wouldn't
leave it like that.

403
00:24:05,374 --> 00:24:08,377
Like what?
Like it was this afternoon.

404
00:24:08,461 --> 00:24:11,756
I must have said something that
gave you a terribly wrong impression.

405
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:14,717
You must never think anything
like that about me, Walter.

406
00:24:14,801 --> 00:24:16,052
Okay.
No, it's not okay.

407
00:24:16,135 --> 00:24:18,972
Not if you don't believe me.
What do you want me to do?

408
00:24:19,973 --> 00:24:21,683
I want you to be nice to me.

409
00:24:22,475 --> 00:24:24,978
Like the first time
you came to the house.

410
00:24:25,061 --> 00:24:27,272
It can't be
like the first time.

411
00:24:27,355 --> 00:24:30,150
Something's happened.
I know it has.

412
00:24:30,942 --> 00:24:32,694
It's happened to us.

413
00:24:35,238 --> 00:24:39,243
I feel as if he was watching me.
Not that he cares. Not anymore.

414
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:43,580
He keeps me on a leash
so tight I can't breathe.

415
00:24:43,622 --> 00:24:46,166
He's in Long Beach,
isn't he? Relax.

416
00:24:46,542 --> 00:24:48,544
Maybe I oughtn't
to have come.

417
00:24:48,627 --> 00:24:51,338
Maybe you oughtn't.
You want me to go?

418
00:24:51,422 --> 00:24:53,716
If you want to.
Right now?

419
00:24:53,757 --> 00:24:55,050
Sure, right now.

420
00:25:09,607 --> 00:25:11,025
[Walter sighing]

421
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:14,571
I'm crazy about you, baby.
I'm crazy about you, Walter.

422
00:25:14,821 --> 00:25:17,407
That perfume on your hair.
What's the name of it?

423
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,410
I don't know.
I bought it in Ensenada.

424
00:25:21,536 --> 00:25:23,705
You ought to have some of that
pink wine to go with it.

425
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:26,666
The kind that bubbles.
All I got is bourbon.

426
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:29,711
Bourbon is fine, Walter.

427
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,637
Get a couple of glasses,
will you?

428
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,188
Club soda?
Plain water, please.

429
00:25:49,857 --> 00:25:53,068
You know, about six months ago a guy
slipped on a cake of soap in his bathtub...

430
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,446
and knocked himself cold
and was drowned.

431
00:25:55,946 --> 00:25:57,907
Only he had
accident insurance.

432
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,493
So they had an autopsy and
she didn't get away with it.

433
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,662
Who didn't?
His wife.

434
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:07,250
Then there was a case of a guy
who was found shot.

435
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:10,545
His wife said he was cleaning a
gun and his stomach got in the way.

436
00:26:11,254 --> 00:26:14,257
All she collected was a
three-to-ten stretch in Tehachapi.

437
00:26:15,091 --> 00:26:17,135
Perhaps it was
worth it to her.

438
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:21,973
See if you can carry that
as far as the living room.

439
00:26:25,852 --> 00:26:28,939
It's nice here, Walter.
Who takes care of it for you?

440
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:31,608
A colored woman comes in
a couple of times a week.

441
00:26:31,692 --> 00:26:34,736
Cook your own breakfast? Squeeze
a grapefruit once in a while.

442
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:37,739
Get the rest down at the corner
drugstore. Sounds wonderful.

443
00:26:37,823 --> 00:26:39,533
Just strangers beside you.

444
00:26:39,992 --> 00:26:42,327
You don't know them
and you don't hate them.

445
00:26:42,494 --> 00:26:43,996
You don't have to
sit across the table...

446
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:47,291
and smile at him and that daughter
of his every morning of your life.

447
00:26:47,374 --> 00:26:50,628
What daughter? You mean the
little girl on the piano?

448
00:26:51,003 --> 00:26:52,713
Lola. She lives with us.

449
00:26:52,797 --> 00:26:55,341
He thinks a lot more of her
than he does of me.

450
00:26:55,716 --> 00:26:58,135
You ever think of a divorce?
He wouldn't give me a divorce.

451
00:26:58,219 --> 00:26:59,637
I suppose because it'd
cost him too much money.

452
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,265
He hasn't got any money. Not since
he went into the oil business.

453
00:27:02,348 --> 00:27:04,100
But he had
when you married him?

454
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,688
Yes, he had.
And I wanted a home. Why not?

455
00:27:09,898 --> 00:27:13,193
But that's not the only
reason. I was his wife's nurse.

456
00:27:13,234 --> 00:27:16,863
She was sick a long time. When she
died, he was terribly broken up.

457
00:27:18,281 --> 00:27:20,367
I pitied him so.
And now you hate him.

458
00:27:20,575 --> 00:27:23,370
Yes, Walter.
He's so mean to me.

459
00:27:23,745 --> 00:27:26,373
Every time I buy a dress or a pair
of shoes he yells his head off.

460
00:27:26,456 --> 00:27:28,208
He never lets me go anywhere.
He keeps me shut up.

461
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,960
He's always been mean to me.

462
00:27:30,252 --> 00:27:33,922
Even his life insurance all
goes to that daughter of his.

463
00:27:34,756 --> 00:27:37,134
That Lola.
Nothing for you at all?

464
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:39,636
No. And nothing is just
what I'm worth to him.

465
00:27:40,721 --> 00:27:44,099
So you lie awake in the dark and
listen to him snore and get ideas.

466
00:27:44,767 --> 00:27:47,186
Walter, I don't want
to kill him. I never did.

467
00:27:47,978 --> 00:27:50,564
Not even when he gets drunk
and slaps my face.

468
00:27:53,442 --> 00:27:56,487
Only sometimes you wish
he was dead. Perhaps I do.

469
00:27:56,571 --> 00:28:00,283
Then you wish it was an accident,
and you had that policy for $50,000.

470
00:28:00,783 --> 00:28:02,910
Is that it?
Perhaps that, too.

471
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:08,166
The other night we drove home
from a party. He was drunk again.

472
00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:12,086
When we drove into the garage, he just sat
there with his head on the steering wheel...

473
00:28:12,128 --> 00:28:13,880
and the motor still running.

474
00:28:14,381 --> 00:28:17,926
And I thought what it would be
like if I didn't switch it off...

475
00:28:18,802 --> 00:28:21,388
just closed the garage doors
and left him there.

476
00:28:21,471 --> 00:28:22,597
I'll tell you what
it'd be like.

477
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:25,267
If you had that accident policy
and tried to pull a monoxide job...

478
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,436
We've got a guy
in our office named Keyes.

479
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,522
For him a setup like that'd be just
like a slice of rare roast beef.

480
00:28:30,647 --> 00:28:32,441
In three minutes he'd know
it wasn't an accident.

481
00:28:32,482 --> 00:28:34,610
In 10 minutes you'd be sitting
under the hot lights.

482
00:28:34,651 --> 00:28:36,820
In a half-hour you'd be signing
your name to a confession.

483
00:28:36,904 --> 00:28:38,739
But, Walter, I didn't do it
and I'm not going to do it.

484
00:28:38,822 --> 00:28:41,075
Not if there's an insurance
company in the picture, baby.

485
00:28:41,158 --> 00:28:43,244
They know more tricks
than a carload of monkeys.

486
00:28:43,327 --> 00:28:45,788
And if there's a death mixed up
in it, you haven't got a prayer.

487
00:28:45,871 --> 00:28:48,958
They'll hang you just as sure
as ten dimes will buy a dollar.

488
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:51,293
And I don't want you
to hang, baby.

489
00:28:54,338 --> 00:28:56,299
Stop thinking about it,
will you?

490
00:28:59,844 --> 00:29:01,512
<i>(Walter)
So we just sat there.</i>

491
00:29:01,888 --> 00:29:05,975
<i>She started crying softly, like the rain
on the window, and we didn't say anything.</i>

492
00:29:06,226 --> 00:29:09,020
<i>Maybe she had stopped thinking
about it, but I hadn't.</i>

493
00:29:09,312 --> 00:29:10,313
I couldn't.

494
00:29:10,396 --> 00:29:13,858
Because it all tied up with something
I'd been thinking about for years.

495
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,653
Since long before I ever
ran into Phyllis Dietrichson.

496
00:29:17,612 --> 00:29:19,573
Because you know
how it is, Keyes.

497
00:29:20,115 --> 00:29:21,283
In this business
you can't sleep...

498
00:29:21,366 --> 00:29:24,202
for trying to figure out all the
tricks they could pull on you.

499
00:29:24,244 --> 00:29:25,704
You're like the guy
behind the roulette wheel...

500
00:29:25,787 --> 00:29:29,082
watching the customers to make
sure they don't crook the house.

501
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:32,836
And then one night, you get to thinking
how you could crook the house yourself.

502
00:29:32,878 --> 00:29:34,421
And do it smart.

503
00:29:34,505 --> 00:29:36,590
Because you've got that wheel
right under your hands.

504
00:29:36,673 --> 00:29:38,801
You know every notch in it
by heart.

505
00:29:39,051 --> 00:29:41,554
And you figure all you need
is a plant out front.

506
00:29:41,887 --> 00:29:43,681
A shill to put down the bet.

507
00:29:44,723 --> 00:29:45,850
And suddenly
the doorbell rings...

508
00:29:45,933 --> 00:29:48,394
and the whole setup is right
there in the room with you.

509
00:29:52,231 --> 00:29:55,318
Look, Keyes, I'm not trying
to whitewash myself.

510
00:29:56,277 --> 00:29:59,739
I fought it, only I guess
I didn't fight it hard enough.

511
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:05,036
The stakes were $50,000, but
they were the life of a man, too.

512
00:30:05,995 --> 00:30:08,414
A man who'd never
done me any dirt, except...

513
00:30:09,124 --> 00:30:11,710
he was married to a woman
he didn't care anything about.

514
00:30:13,294 --> 00:30:14,504
<i>And I did.</i>

515
00:30:26,725 --> 00:30:29,645
Will you phone me? Walter?

516
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:35,359
I hate him.
I loathe going back to him.

517
00:30:35,484 --> 00:30:38,362
You believe me, don't you,
Walter? Sure I believe you.

518
00:30:41,198 --> 00:30:44,326
I can't stand it anymore.
What if they did hang me?

519
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,746
They're not going
to hang you, baby.

520
00:30:46,787 --> 00:30:48,372
It's better than
going on this way.

521
00:30:48,456 --> 00:30:49,582
They're not gonna
hang you because...

522
00:30:49,665 --> 00:30:51,459
you're gonna do it
and I'm gonna help you.

523
00:30:51,542 --> 00:30:54,253
Do you know what you're saying?
Sure, I know what I'm saying.

524
00:30:54,295 --> 00:30:55,797
We're gonna do it
and we're gonna do it right.

525
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,008
And I'm the guy that knows
how. Walter, you're hurting me.

526
00:30:59,092 --> 00:31:02,095
There's not going to be any slip-up.
Nothing sloppy. Nothing weak.

527
00:31:02,136 --> 00:31:03,596
It's got to be perfect.

528
00:31:16,443 --> 00:31:18,945
Call me tomorrow. But not
from your house. From a booth.

529
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:20,906
And watch your step
every single minute.

530
00:31:20,989 --> 00:31:24,117
This has got to be perfect, you
understand? Straight down the line.

531
00:31:24,826 --> 00:31:27,329
Straight down the line.

532
00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:56,484
[Rain pattering]

533
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,030
[Car engine starts]

534
00:32:03,324 --> 00:32:05,076
[Car driving away]

535
00:32:09,873 --> 00:32:11,583
<i>(Walter)
That was it, Keyes.</i>

536
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:14,669
<i>The machinery had started to
move and nothing could stop it.</i>

537
00:32:15,378 --> 00:32:18,840
The first thing we had to do was
fix him up with that accident policy.

538
00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:23,053
I knew he wouldn't buy, but all I wanted
was his signature on an application.

539
00:32:23,595 --> 00:32:26,640
So I had to get him to sign without
his knowing what he was signing.

540
00:32:27,891 --> 00:32:31,729
And I wanted another witness besides
Phyllis to hear me give him a sales talk.

541
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:34,189
I was trying to think
with your brains, Keyes...

542
00:32:34,273 --> 00:32:36,400
because I wanted
all the answers ready...

543
00:32:36,483 --> 00:32:40,988
for all the questions you were gonna
spring as soon as Dietrichson was dead.

544
00:32:41,238 --> 00:32:43,532
A couple of nights later
I went to the house.

545
00:32:44,283 --> 00:32:48,371
Everything looked fine, except I didn't
like the witness Phyllis had brought in.

546
00:32:48,788 --> 00:32:50,915
It was Dietrichson's
daughter, Lola.

547
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:54,502
And it made me feel
a little queer in the belly...

548
00:32:54,585 --> 00:32:57,630
to have her sitting right there in
the room, playing Chinese checkers...

549
00:32:58,715 --> 00:33:00,300
<i>as if nothing
were going to happen.</i>

550
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,887
(Walter) I suppose you
realize, Mr. Dietrichson...

551
00:33:03,928 --> 00:33:05,221
that, not being an employee...

552
00:33:05,305 --> 00:33:07,599
you are not covered by the
State Compensation Insurance Act.

553
00:33:07,682 --> 00:33:10,977
The only way you can protect yourself is
by having a personal policy of your own.

554
00:33:11,061 --> 00:33:12,229
Yeah, I know
all about that.

555
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,772
The next thing
you'll tell me I need...

556
00:33:13,814 --> 00:33:17,359
earthquake insurance and lightning
insurance and hail insurance.

557
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:19,152
If we bought all the insurance
they can think up...

558
00:33:19,236 --> 00:33:21,029
we'd stay broke paying
for it, wouldn't we, honey?

559
00:33:21,113 --> 00:33:24,950
What keeps us broke is you going
out and buying five hats at a crack.

560
00:33:25,033 --> 00:33:26,743
Who needs a hat in California?

561
00:33:26,785 --> 00:33:28,495
Dollar for dollar,
Mr. Dietrichson...

562
00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:30,998
accident insurance is the
cheapest coverage you can buy.

563
00:33:31,081 --> 00:33:33,959
Well, maybe some other time,
Mr. Neff. I had a tough day.

564
00:33:34,001 --> 00:33:35,085
Just as you say.

565
00:33:35,169 --> 00:33:37,963
Suppose we just settle that
automobile insurance tonight.

566
00:33:38,089 --> 00:33:39,256
Sure.

567
00:33:39,507 --> 00:33:42,927
All we'll need on that is for you
to sign the application for renewal.

568
00:33:43,052 --> 00:33:44,887
Phyllis, do you mind
if we don't finish this game?

569
00:33:44,971 --> 00:33:47,306
It bores me stiff.
Got something better to do?

570
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:48,641
Yes, I have.

571
00:33:49,934 --> 00:33:51,769
Father, is it all right
if I run along now?

572
00:33:51,811 --> 00:33:54,939
Run along where? Who with? Just
Anne. We're going roller-skating.

573
00:33:55,023 --> 00:33:56,774
Anne who?
Anne Matthews.

574
00:33:56,858 --> 00:33:58,818
It's not that Nino
Zachetti again, is it?

575
00:33:58,902 --> 00:34:00,320
It better not be
that Zachetti guy.

576
00:34:00,361 --> 00:34:01,613
If I ever catch you
with that...

577
00:34:01,654 --> 00:34:03,031
It's Anne Matthews,
I told you.

578
00:34:03,114 --> 00:34:05,200
And I also told you
we're going roller-skating.

579
00:34:05,283 --> 00:34:08,370
I'm meeting her at the corner of Vermont
and Franklin, the northwest corner...

580
00:34:08,453 --> 00:34:10,914
in case you're interested,
and I'm late already.

581
00:34:10,997 --> 00:34:13,542
I hope that's all quite clear.
Good night, Father.

582
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:15,961
Good night, Phyllis. Good
night, Miss Dietrichson.

583
00:34:16,044 --> 00:34:18,046
I'm sorry. Good night, Mr... Neff.

584
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,798
Good night, Mr. Neff.

585
00:34:22,843 --> 00:34:24,803
A great little fighter
for her weight.

586
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,307
Now, if you'll just
sign these, Mr. Dietrichson.

587
00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:30,768
Sign what? The applications
for the auto renewals.

588
00:34:30,851 --> 00:34:32,811
So you'll be covered until
the new policies are issued.

589
00:34:32,853 --> 00:34:34,563
When will that be?
About a week.

590
00:34:34,647 --> 00:34:36,565
Just so I'm covered
when I drive up north.

591
00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:38,484
San Francisco?
Palo Alto.

592
00:34:38,526 --> 00:34:40,277
He was a Stanford man,
Mr. Neff.

593
00:34:40,361 --> 00:34:42,780
And he still goes to his
class reunion every year.

594
00:34:42,863 --> 00:34:46,409
What's wrong with that? Can't I
have a little fun, even once a year?

595
00:34:46,492 --> 00:34:48,161
Great football school,
Stanford.

596
00:34:48,202 --> 00:34:50,204
Did you play football, Mr.
Dietrichson? Left guard.

597
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:51,914
Almost made the varsity, too.
Where do I sign?

598
00:34:51,998 --> 00:34:53,333
The bottom line.

599
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:00,006
Both copies, please.
Sign twice, huh?

600
00:35:00,048 --> 00:35:01,341
Yes. One is
the agent's copy.

601
00:35:01,424 --> 00:35:05,387
I need it for my files.
Files. Duplicates. Triplicates.

602
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:12,602
Thank you,
Mr. Dietrichson.

603
00:35:12,686 --> 00:35:15,522
Don't worry about the check, I can
pick it up at your office some morning.

604
00:35:15,564 --> 00:35:17,816
How much you taking me for?
$147.50.

605
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,569
I think that's enough insurance
for one evening, Mr. Neff.

606
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:21,862
Plenty.

607
00:35:25,741 --> 00:35:28,410
Bring me some soda when you come
up, Phyllis. Good night, Mr. Neff.

608
00:35:28,494 --> 00:35:29,536
Good night, Mr. Dietrichson.

609
00:35:29,578 --> 00:35:32,206
I think you left your hat
in the hall, Mr. Neff.

610
00:35:47,722 --> 00:35:49,515
Good night, Mr. Neff.

611
00:35:52,185 --> 00:35:53,394
All right, Walter?
Fine.

612
00:35:53,436 --> 00:35:55,355
He signed it, didn't he? Sure
he signed it. You saw him.

613
00:35:55,438 --> 00:35:57,357
Now, listen. That trip to
Palo Alto. When does he leave?

614
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,400
End of the month.

615
00:35:58,483 --> 00:35:59,484
He drives, huh?
He always drives.

616
00:35:59,567 --> 00:36:01,194
Not this time. You're gonna
make him take the train.

617
00:36:01,277 --> 00:36:02,821
Why? Because it's all
worked out for a train.

618
00:36:02,904 --> 00:36:05,282
Listen, baby. There's a clause
in every accident policy...

619
00:36:05,323 --> 00:36:07,200
a little thing called
double indemnity.

620
00:36:07,284 --> 00:36:10,162
The insurance companies put it in as
a sort of come-on for the customers.

621
00:36:10,245 --> 00:36:12,414
That means they pay double
on certain accidents.

622
00:36:12,456 --> 00:36:14,082
The kind that almost
never happen.

623
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:16,668
Like for instance, if a guy
is killed on the train...

624
00:36:16,752 --> 00:36:19,171
they pay $100,000
instead of $50,000.

625
00:36:19,254 --> 00:36:21,673
I see. We're hitting
it for the limit, baby.

626
00:36:21,757 --> 00:36:24,259
That's why
it's got to be the train.

627
00:36:25,594 --> 00:36:28,430
It'll be the train, Walter.
Just the way you want it.

628
00:36:28,472 --> 00:36:30,391
Straight down the line.

629
00:36:49,786 --> 00:36:51,371
(Lola)
Hello, Mr. Neff.

630
00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:53,998
It's me.

631
00:36:54,749 --> 00:36:57,127
Is anything wrong?
I've been waiting for you.

632
00:36:57,168 --> 00:36:58,294
For me? Why?

633
00:36:58,336 --> 00:37:01,631
I thought you could let me ride
with you, if you're going my way.

634
00:37:06,803 --> 00:37:10,265
Which way would that be?
Down the hill. Down Vermont.

635
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:13,310
Sure. Vermont and Franklin.
Northwest corner, wasn't it?

636
00:37:13,393 --> 00:37:14,728
Be glad to, Miss Dietrichson.

637
00:37:19,191 --> 00:37:21,151
Going roller-skating, huh?

638
00:37:21,276 --> 00:37:24,655
You like roller-skating?
I can take it or leave it.

639
00:37:25,823 --> 00:37:28,701
Only tonight you're
leaving it? Yes, I am.

640
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:32,747
I'm having
a very tough time at home.

641
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:36,208
My father doesn't understand
me and Phyllis hates me.

642
00:37:36,626 --> 00:37:40,171
Sounds tough, all right. That's
why I have to lie sometimes.

643
00:37:40,213 --> 00:37:41,631
You mean it's not
Vermont and Franklin?

644
00:37:41,714 --> 00:37:43,633
It's Vermont and Franklin
all right.

645
00:37:43,716 --> 00:37:46,844
Only it's not Anne Matthews.
It's Nino Zachetti.

646
00:37:48,012 --> 00:37:49,973
You won't tell on me,
will you?

647
00:37:50,056 --> 00:37:52,767
I'd have to think it over. Nino's
not what my father says at all.

648
00:37:52,851 --> 00:37:55,937
He's just had bad luck.
He was doing premed at USC...

649
00:37:56,021 --> 00:37:58,982
and working nights as an usher
in a theater downtown.

650
00:37:59,065 --> 00:38:01,693
Got behind in his credits,
flunked out.

651
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:05,822
Then he lost his job for
talking back. He's so hot-headed.

652
00:38:07,032 --> 00:38:08,325
Becomes expensive, doesn't it?

653
00:38:08,408 --> 00:38:10,869
Guess my father thinks nobody's
good enough for his daughter...

654
00:38:10,953 --> 00:38:13,205
except maybe the guy that
owns Standard Oil.

655
00:38:13,247 --> 00:38:17,042
I wish he'd see it my way.
I can't give Nino up.

656
00:38:18,419 --> 00:38:20,629
It'll all straighten out,
Miss Dietrichson.

657
00:38:20,713 --> 00:38:24,884
I suppose it will sometime. This
is the corner right here, Mr. Neff.

658
00:38:27,303 --> 00:38:30,056
(Lola)
Nino? Over here, Nino.

659
00:38:38,773 --> 00:38:41,317
This is Mr. Neff, Nino.
Hello, Nino.

660
00:38:41,567 --> 00:38:43,027
The name is Zachetti.

661
00:38:43,111 --> 00:38:45,738
Nino, please. Mr. Neff gave
me a ride from the house.

662
00:38:45,822 --> 00:38:46,906
I told him all about us.

663
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,366
Why does he have to
get told about us?

664
00:38:48,449 --> 00:38:50,410
We don't have to worry
about Mr. Neff, Nino.

665
00:38:50,493 --> 00:38:52,078
I'm not doing any worrying.

666
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,413
Just don't you
broadcast so much.

667
00:38:53,496 --> 00:38:55,248
Well, what's the matter
with you, Nino?

668
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:57,792
Why, he's a friend.
I don't have any friends.

669
00:38:57,876 --> 00:39:00,128
If I did, I like to pick
them myself. Come on.

670
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,547
Look, sonny, she needed a
ride, so I brought her along.

671
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,758
Is that anything
to get tough about?

672
00:39:04,841 --> 00:39:07,302
All right, Lola, make up your
mind. Are you coming or aren't you?

673
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:09,179
Of course I'm coming.

674
00:39:11,723 --> 00:39:15,018
Don't mind him, Mr. Neff.
And thanks a lot for the ride.

675
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:17,438
You're awfully sweet. Nino?

676
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,528
<i>(Walter)
She was a nice kid.</i>

677
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,782
<i>Maybe he was a little better
than he sounded.</i>

678
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:31,285

to be thinking about them at all...</i>

that had her father's signature in it...</i>

680
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,250
<i>and what that signature meant.</i>

681
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,544
<i>It meant he was a dead pigeon.</i>

682
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:43,673
<i>It was only a question of time,
and not very much time at that.</i>

683
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:46,467
<i>You know that big market
up on Los Feliz, Keyes?</i>

684
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,805
<i>That's the place Phyllis and I
had picked for a meeting place.</i>

685
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,974
<i>I already had most of
the plan in my head...</i>

686
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:55,310
<i>but a lot of details
had to be worked out.</i>

687
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,980
<i>And she had to know them all
by heart when the time came.</i>

688
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:01,983
<i>We had to be very careful
from now on.</i>

689
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,778
<i>We couldn't let anybody
see us together.</i>

690
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,739
<i>We couldn't even talk to
each other on the telephone.</i>

691
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:10,701
<i>Not from her house
or at my office, anyway.</i>

692
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:15,664
<i>So she was to be in the market every
morning about 11:00, buying stuff.</i>

693
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:19,376
<i>And I could sort of run into
her there any day I wanted to.</i>

694
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:21,754
<i>Sort of accidentally
on purpose.</i>

695
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:25,132
Walter, I wanted to...
Not so loud.

696
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,260
I wanted to talk to you,
ever since yesterday.

697
00:40:28,344 --> 00:40:30,471
Let me talk first.
It's all set.

698
00:40:30,554 --> 00:40:33,015
The accident policy came
through. I've got it in my pocket.

699
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:36,060
I got his check, too. I saw
him down in the oil fields.

700
00:40:36,102 --> 00:40:38,229
He thought he was paying
for the auto insurance.

701
00:40:38,312 --> 00:40:41,190
The check's just made out to the
company, so it could be for anything.

702
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:44,027
But you have to send a check
for the auto insurance, see?

Can you get in
the safe-deposit box?

707
00:40:55,664 --> 00:40:57,666
Yes. We both have keys.
Fine.

708
00:40:57,749 --> 00:41:00,043
But don't put the policy in
there yet. I'll tell you when.

709
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:02,838
Remember, you never saw it, you
never even touched it, you understand?

710
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:05,507
I'm not a fool. Okay. When
is he leaving on the train?

711
00:41:05,591 --> 00:41:07,050
That's just it. He isn't going. What?

712
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:09,011
That's what I've been trying
to tell you. The trip is off.

713
00:41:09,094 --> 00:41:10,679
What happened?

714
00:41:12,264 --> 00:41:15,267
Mister, could you reach me
that package of baby food?

715
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:16,977
That one up there?

716
00:41:18,938 --> 00:41:22,733
I don't know why they always
put what I want on the top shelf.

717
00:41:24,568 --> 00:41:25,736
Go ahead. I'm listening.

718
00:41:25,778 --> 00:41:28,155
He had a fall-down at the well.
Broke his leg. It's in a cast.

719
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:30,950
Broke his leg?
What do we do now, Walter?

720
00:41:31,075 --> 00:41:33,661
Nothing. We just wait.
Wait for what?

721
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:35,204
Until he can
take the train.

722
00:41:35,288 --> 00:41:36,497
I told you it's got
to be the train.

723
00:41:36,581 --> 00:41:37,915
But we can't wait.
I can't go on like this.

Look, we're not gonna grab a hammer and
do it quick, just to get it over with.

725
00:41:41,044 --> 00:41:43,796
There are other ways. We're
not gonna do it other ways.

726
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,964
But we can't leave it
like this.

727
00:41:45,048 --> 00:41:47,967
What do you suppose would happen if
he found out about the accident policy?

728
00:41:48,051 --> 00:41:50,095
Plenty. But not as bad as
sitting in that death house.

729
00:41:50,178 --> 00:41:52,973
Don't ever talk like that. Don't let's
start losing our heads, that's all.

It's getting me
just as bad, baby.

But we've got to wait.
Maybe we have, Walter, only...

It's like a wall between us.

Thanks. How would you
like a cheap drink?

Do I laugh now or wait till
it gets funny? No, I'm serious.

I've just been talking to Norton.
Too much stuff piling up on my desk.

Too much pressure
on my nerves.

I spend half the night
walking up and down in my bed.

I've got to have an assistant
and I thought of you.

Me? Why pick on me?

757
00:43:14,682 --> 00:43:17,184
Well, because I've got a crazy
idea you might be good at the job.

758
00:43:17,268 --> 00:43:18,686
That's crazy, all right.
I'm a salesman.

759
00:43:18,727 --> 00:43:21,939
Yeah. A peddler,
a gladhander, a backslapper.

760

You're too good
to be a salesman.

00:43:23,858 --> 00:43:25,985
Nobody's too good to
be a salesman. Phooey!

and dish out a smooth line of monkey talk.

is that $50 cut, isn't it?

764
00:43:31,866 --> 00:43:33,368
Well, that'd trouble anybody.
Now look, Walter.

765
00:43:33,451 --> 00:43:36,412
The job I'm talking about
takes brains and integrity.

766
00:43:36,496 --> 00:43:38,414
It takes more guts than
there is in 50 salesmen.

767

It's the hottest job
in the business.

768
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:40,875
Yeah, but it's still
a desk job.

I don't want to be nailed
to a desk. Desk job?

Is that all you can see in it?

Just a hard chair to park your
pants on from 9:00 to 5:00, huh?

00:43:47,882 --> 00:43:50,594
Just a pile of papers to shuffle
around, and five sharp pencils...

and a scratch pad to make figures on,
maybe a little doodling on the side.

Well, that's not the way
I look at it, Walter.

775
00:43:57,225 --> 00:44:01,313
To me, a claims man is a surgeon,
that desk is an operating table...

776
00:44:01,396 --> 00:44:04,233
and those pencils are scalpels
and bone chisels.

777
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:08,070
And those papers are not just forms and
statistics and claims for compensation.

00:44:51,406 --> 00:44:53,992
Walter?
Yeah. I'm listening, Margie.

795
00:44:54,701 --> 00:44:57,245
Only, make it snappy,
will you? He's on crutches.

796
00:44:57,329 --> 00:45:00,624
The doctor says he can go if he's
careful. The change will do him good.

797
00:45:00,707 --> 00:45:03,460
It's wonderful, Walter. Just the
way you wanted it, on a train.

798
00:45:03,544 --> 00:45:06,130
Only with the crutches it makes
it much better, doesn't it?

799
00:45:06,171 --> 00:45:08,632
Yeah. Yeah,
that's 100% better.

800
00:45:10,217 --> 00:45:11,510
Hold the line a minute,
will you?

801
00:45:11,594 --> 00:45:14,305
Keyes, suppose I join you in your
office? That's all right. I'll wait.

802
00:45:14,388 --> 00:45:16,849
Only tell her
not to take all day.

803
00:45:18,601 --> 00:45:19,727
Go ahead.

804
00:45:20,061 --> 00:45:23,147
It's the 10:15 from Glendale.
I'm driving him.

805
00:45:23,189 --> 00:45:25,024
It's still the same
dark street, isn't it?

806
00:45:25,107 --> 00:45:28,361
And the signal is three honks
on the horn. Okay. Anything else?

807
00:45:29,153 --> 00:45:30,154
No.

808
00:45:30,446 --> 00:45:31,447
Oh, uh...

809
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,616
what color did you pick?

810
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:36,578
Blue. Navy blue. And the
cast is on his left leg.

811
00:45:37,328 --> 00:45:38,496
Mmm-hmm.

812
00:45:39,038 --> 00:45:40,582
Yeah, that suits me fine.

813
00:45:40,665 --> 00:45:42,917
This is it, Walter.
I'm shaking like a leaf.

814
00:45:43,001 --> 00:45:46,004
But it's straight down
the line for both of us.

815
00:45:46,087 --> 00:45:48,215
I love you, Walter. Goodbye.

816
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,219
Sorry, Keyes.
What's the matter?

817
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:55,013
Dames chasing you again? Or still?
Or is it none of my business?

818
00:45:55,055 --> 00:45:56,932
If I told you
it was a customer...

819
00:45:57,099 --> 00:45:59,184
Margie. I bet she drinks
from the bottle.

820
00:45:59,226 --> 00:46:01,103
Why don't you settle down
and get married, Walter?

821
00:46:01,186 --> 00:46:05,232
Why don't you, for instance? I
almost did, once. Long time ago.

822
00:46:05,316 --> 00:46:07,067
Now look, Keyes, I've
got to call on a prospect.

823
00:46:07,151 --> 00:46:09,653
Even had the church
picked out, the dame and I.

824
00:46:09,737 --> 00:46:11,989
She had a white satin dress
with flounces on it.

825
00:46:12,072 --> 00:46:14,867
I was on my way to the
jewelry store to buy the ring.

826
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:17,536
And then suddenly that little
man in here started working on me.

827
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:19,163
So you went back
and had her investigated?

828
00:46:19,247 --> 00:46:21,666
Yeah. And the stuff
that came out...

829
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:25,002
She'd been dyeing her hair
ever since she was 16.

830
00:46:25,086 --> 00:46:27,588
There was a manic depressive in
her family, on her mother's side.

831
00:46:27,672 --> 00:46:29,299
She already had one husband.

832
00:46:29,382 --> 00:46:31,467
He was a professional
pool player in Baltimore.

833
00:46:31,551 --> 00:46:33,595
And as for her brother...
I get the general idea.

834
00:46:33,678 --> 00:46:37,307
She was a tramp from a long line of
tramps. Yeah. All right, all right.

835
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:40,101
Now what do I say to Norton? What
about this job I want you for?

836
00:46:40,185 --> 00:46:41,728
I don't think
I want it, Keyes.

837
00:46:41,811 --> 00:46:44,314
Thanks just the same.
Fair enough.

838
00:46:45,273 --> 00:46:47,484
Only get this,
I picked you for the job...

839
00:46:47,567 --> 00:46:49,736
not because I think
you're so darn smart...

840
00:46:49,778 --> 00:46:53,115
but because I thought you were a shade
less dumb than the rest of the outfit.

841
00:47:00,289 --> 00:47:03,292
Guess I was wrong.
You're not smarter, Walter.

842
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:05,669
You're just a little taller.

843
00:47:16,597 --> 00:47:17,932
<i>(Walter)
Yes, Keyes.</i>

844
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:21,602
<i>Those Fates I was talking about
had only been stalling me off.</i>

845
00:47:21,686 --> 00:47:25,064
<i>Now they had thrown the
switch. The gears had meshed.</i>

846
00:47:25,148 --> 00:47:27,775
<i>The time for thinking
had all run out.</i>

847
00:47:28,526 --> 00:47:32,280
<i>I wanted my movements accounted
for up to the last possible moment.</i>

848
00:47:32,322 --> 00:47:36,451
<i>So when I left the office I put my rate
book on the desk as if I had forgotten it.</i>

849
00:47:36,534 --> 00:47:38,578
<i>That was part of my alibi.</i>

850
00:47:39,996 --> 00:47:42,749
<i>From here on, it was a question
of following the timetable...</i>

851
00:47:42,832 --> 00:47:43,834
<i>move by move.</i>

852
00:47:45,669 --> 00:47:48,797
<i>I got home about 7:00 and
drove right into the garage.</i>

853
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:51,800
<i>This was another item
to establish my alibi.</i>

854
00:47:53,176 --> 00:47:55,470
Hi, Mr. Neff.
Hello, Charlie.

855
00:47:55,512 --> 00:47:57,347
How about giving
the heap a wash job?

856
00:47:57,431 --> 00:47:58,599
How soon you gonna want it?

857
00:47:58,682 --> 00:48:00,059
I got a couple cars
ahead of you.

858
00:48:00,142 --> 00:48:01,644
Any time you get
to it, Charlie.

859
00:48:01,727 --> 00:48:03,979
I'm staying in tonight.
Okay.

860
00:48:04,063 --> 00:48:06,023
<i>(Walter) Up in my apartment
I called Lou Schwartz...</i>

861
00:48:06,106 --> 00:48:08,400
<i>one of the salesmen
that shared my office.</i>

862
00:48:08,484 --> 00:48:11,862
<i>He lived in Westwood, so it was a toll
call and there'd be a record of it.</i>

863
00:48:11,946 --> 00:48:14,240
<i>I told him I'd forgotten my
rate book and needed some dope...</i>

864
00:48:14,323 --> 00:48:17,243
<i>on the public liability bond
I was figuring.</i>

865
00:48:17,368 --> 00:48:21,164
<i>I changed into a navy blue suit
like Dietrichson was going to wear.</i>

866
00:48:21,205 --> 00:48:24,334
<i>Lou Schwartz called me back
and gave me a lot of figures.</i>

867
00:48:24,375 --> 00:48:26,836
<i>I stuffed a hand towel and a roll
of adhesive into my pockets...</i>

868
00:48:26,878 --> 00:48:30,882
<i>so I could fake something that
looked like a cast on a broken leg.</i>

869
00:48:30,965 --> 00:48:33,009
<i>Next, I stuck a card
inside the telephone box...</i>

870
00:48:33,051 --> 00:48:35,887
<i>so that it would fall down
if the bell rang.</i>

871
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:39,474
<i>That way I'd know if anybody
had called me while I was away.</i>

872
00:48:39,558 --> 00:48:43,728
<i>Then I did the same thing to the
doorbell in case anybody came to see me.</i>

873
00:48:44,229 --> 00:48:47,858
<i>I left the apartment by the
service stairs. Nobody saw me.</i>

874
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:52,154
<i>I walked all the way from my
apartment to the Dietrichson house.</i>

875
00:48:52,237 --> 00:48:53,572
<i>I didn't want
to take the bus...</i>

876
00:48:53,655 --> 00:48:57,326
<i>because there was always the chance that
someone might remember seeing me on it.</i>

877
00:48:57,409 --> 00:48:59,370
<i>I was being that careful.</i>

878
00:48:59,787 --> 00:49:02,373
<i>I could smell that
honeysuckle again.</i>

879
00:49:02,498 --> 00:49:05,668
<i>Only it was even stronger,
now that it was night.</i>

880
00:49:10,089 --> 00:49:13,259
<i>I slid the garage door open
as quietly as I could.</i>

881
00:49:13,593 --> 00:49:16,679
<i>She'd backed the sedan in,
just the way I told her to.</i>

882
00:49:16,762 --> 00:49:18,222
<i>I'd figured it was
safer that way...</i>

883
00:49:18,306 --> 00:49:21,392
<i>in case he got into the car
before she drove it out.</i>

884
00:49:21,434 --> 00:49:23,728
<i>I got into
the back of the car.</i>

885
00:49:23,811 --> 00:49:26,272
<i>I lay there on the floor
and waited.</i>

886
00:49:26,356 --> 00:49:29,442
<i>All the time I was thinking about that
dark street on the way to the station...</i>

887
00:49:29,526 --> 00:49:31,319
<i>where I was to do it...</i>

888
00:49:31,403 --> 00:49:34,155
<i>and the three honks on the
horn that were to be the signal.</i>

889
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:36,616
<i>About 10 minutes later
they came down.</i>

890
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,410
All right, honey?
Yeah, I'm all right.

891
00:49:38,493 --> 00:49:40,954
I'll have the car out
in a second.

892
00:49:58,806 --> 00:50:00,182
[Inaudible]

893
00:50:17,742 --> 00:50:21,037
Take it easy, honey. We've
got lots of time. Yeah.

894
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:42,476
Remember what the doctor said.
If you get careless...

895
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,311
you might end up
with a shorter leg.

896
00:50:44,353 --> 00:50:48,148
So what? I could break the other
one and match them up again.

897
00:50:48,524 --> 00:50:51,026
It makes you feel pretty good
to get away from me, doesn't it?

898
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:54,822
It's only for four days. I'll
be back Monday at the latest.

899
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,175
This is not the right street.
Why did you turn here?

900
00:51:16,636 --> 00:51:18,054
[Honking]

901
00:51:18,137 --> 00:51:20,264
What are you doing that for?

902
00:51:21,266 --> 00:51:23,726
What are you
honking the horn for?

903
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:25,895

[Bell ringing]

906
00:52:23,913 --> 00:52:25,874
You take care of the redcap
and the conductor.

907
00:52:25,957 --> 00:52:28,293
Don't worry. Keep away
from me as much as you can.

908
00:52:28,376 --> 00:52:30,837
Tell them I don't want to be
helped. I said, don't worry, Walter.

909
00:52:30,921 --> 00:52:33,131
You start as soon as
the train leaves.

910
00:52:33,215 --> 00:52:35,884
When you get to the refinery, turn
off the highway onto the dirt road.

911
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:37,511
From there it's exactly
eight-tenths of a mile...

912
00:52:37,594 --> 00:52:39,012
to the dump beside the tracks.
Remember.

913
00:52:39,096 --> 00:52:41,598
I remember everything.
No speeding.

914
00:52:42,975 --> 00:52:45,644
You don't want any cops stopping
you with him in the back.

915
00:52:45,727 --> 00:52:48,105
Walter, we've been through
all that so many times.

916
00:52:48,147 --> 00:52:50,441
When you leave the highway,
turn off all your lights.

917
00:52:50,524 --> 00:52:52,609
I'll be back on
the observation platform.

918
00:52:52,693 --> 00:52:55,362
I'll drop off as close to
the spot as I can.

919
00:52:55,446 --> 00:52:58,491
Let the train pass,
then dim your lights twice.

920
00:53:01,035 --> 00:53:03,996
San Francisco train, lady? Car
9, section 11. Just my husband.

921
00:53:04,038 --> 00:53:06,540
Car 9, section 11?
This way please.

922
00:53:14,632 --> 00:53:16,551
Thank you. My husband
doesn't like to be helped.

923
00:53:16,634 --> 00:53:18,469
Car number 8. Up there.

924
00:53:23,808 --> 00:53:27,395
Car 9, section 11. Thank you.

925
00:53:30,023 --> 00:53:32,400
Here're the tickets. Take good
care of yourself with that leg.

926
00:53:32,484 --> 00:53:33,819
Yeah. You take it easy
driving home.

927
00:53:33,902 --> 00:53:37,364
I'll miss you, honey.

Yes, sir.

00:54:02,223 --> 00:54:03,891
I'm going back to the
observation car for a smoke.

935
00:54:03,975 --> 00:54:05,685

No, thanks. I'd rather stand.

My name's Jackson.

941
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:54,109
I'm going all the way
to Medford. Medford, Oregon.

942
00:54:54,527 --> 00:54:56,529
I had a broken arm once.

943
00:54:57,029 --> 00:55:00,324
That darn cast itches
something fierce, doesn't it?

944
00:55:00,449 --> 00:55:02,743
I thought I'd go crazy
with mine.

945
00:55:02,785 --> 00:55:06,873
Palo Alto's a nice little
town. You a Stanford man?

946
00:55:07,665 --> 00:55:11,878
I used to be. I'll bet
you left something behind.

947
00:55:12,629 --> 00:55:14,047
I always do.

948
00:55:14,213 --> 00:55:17,592
My cigar case. I guess I left it
in my overcoat back in the section.

949
00:55:17,634 --> 00:55:20,970
Would you care to roll
yourself a cigarette, Mister...

951
00:55:22,555 --> 00:55:25,058
No thanks,
I really prefer a cigar.

952
00:55:25,767 --> 00:55:28,937
Maybe the porter could... Well,
I could get your cigars for you.

953
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:32,399
Be glad to, Mr. Dietrichson.
If it's not too much trouble.

954
00:55:32,482 --> 00:55:36,278
Car 9, section 11. Car 9,
section 11. With pleasure.

955
00:56:20,532 --> 00:56:22,117
Okay. This has gotta be fast.

956
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,662
Here, take his hat. Pick up
the crutches back on the tracks.

957
00:56:54,942 --> 00:56:56,819
Okay, baby. That's it.

958
00:57:12,794 --> 00:57:14,838
[Engine faltering]

959
00:57:43,659 --> 00:57:45,369
[Engine choking]

960
00:57:47,538 --> 00:57:49,748
[Engine starting]

961
00:57:55,129 --> 00:57:56,923
All right. Let's go.

962
00:58:06,808 --> 00:58:08,601
<i>(Walter) On the way back,
we went over once more...</i>

963
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:10,103
<i>what she was to do
at the inquest...</i>

964
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:13,940
<i>if they had one, and about the
insurance, when that came up.</i>

965
00:58:14,065 --> 00:58:17,110
<i>I was afraid she might go to pieces
a little, now that we had done it.</i>

966
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:21,781
<i>But she was perfect. No nerves. Not
a tear, not even a blink of the eyes.</i>

967
00:58:22,824 --> 00:58:25,869
<i>She dropped me a block
from my apartment house.</i>

968
00:58:26,661 --> 00:58:30,123
Walter, what's the matter?
Aren't you going to kiss me?

969
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:37,673
It's straight down the line,
isn't it?

970
00:58:42,428 --> 00:58:45,890
I love you, Walter.
I love you, baby.

971
00:58:59,028 --> 00:59:02,824
<i>It was two minutes past 11:00, as
I went up the service stairs again.</i>

972
00:59:02,865 --> 00:59:06,869
<i>Nobody saw me this time either. In
the apartment I checked the bells.</i>

973
00:59:06,953 --> 00:59:09,956
<i>The cards hadn't moved.
No calls. No visitors.</i>

974
00:59:11,458 --> 00:59:15,420
<i>Then I changed my clothes again.
That left one last thing to do.</i>

975
00:59:16,379 --> 00:59:20,383
<i>I had to go down to the garage.
I wanted Charlie to see me again.</i>

976
00:59:27,057 --> 00:59:29,977
You gonna use your car, after
all? I'm not quite through.

977
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:31,895
Well, that's all right,
Charlie.

978
00:59:31,979 --> 00:59:34,064
Just going up to the drugstore
to get something to eat.

979
00:59:34,148 --> 00:59:37,109
Been working upstairs all night. My
stomach's getting a little sore at me.

980
00:59:37,192 --> 00:59:38,777
Yes, sir, Mr. Neff.

981
00:59:40,738 --> 00:59:42,698
<i>That was all there was to it.</i>

982
00:59:42,781 --> 00:59:45,451
<i>Nothing had slipped,
nothing had been overlooked.</i>

983
00:59:45,534 --> 00:59:47,912
<i>There was nothing
to give us away.</i>

984
00:59:47,995 --> 00:59:51,624
<i>And yet, Keyes, as I was walking
down the street to the drugstore...</i>

985
00:59:51,707 --> 00:59:55,127
<i>suddenly it came over me that
everything would go wrong.</i>

986
00:59:55,211 --> 00:59:58,381
<i>It sounds crazy, Keyes,
but it's true, so help me.</i>

987
00:59:58,589 --> 01:00:00,967
<i>I couldn't hear
my own footsteps.</i>

988
01:00:04,137 --> 01:00:06,389
<i>It was the walk of a dead man.</i>

989
01:00:14,272 --> 01:00:16,858
That was the longest night
I ever lived through, Keyes...

990
01:00:16,942 --> 01:00:20,779
and the next day was worse, when
the story had broke in the papers...

991
01:00:20,862 --> 01:00:22,781
and they started talking
about it at the office...

992
01:00:22,823 --> 01:00:26,076
and the day after that, when
you started digging into it.

993
01:00:26,118 --> 01:00:30,080
I kept my hands in my pockets
because I thought they were shaking.

994
01:00:30,122 --> 01:00:32,374
I put on dark glasses so
people couldn't see my eyes.

995
01:00:32,458 --> 01:00:36,378
And then I took them off again so they
wouldn't get to wondering why I wore them.

996
01:00:36,462 --> 01:00:39,173
I tried to
hold myself together, but...

997
01:00:39,506 --> 01:00:42,510
<i>I could feel my nerves
pulling me to pieces.</i>

998
01:00:45,262 --> 01:00:48,099
Oh, Walter?
Hello, Keyes.

999
01:00:48,349 --> 01:00:50,518
Come along. The big boss
wants to see us.

1000
01:00:50,601 --> 01:00:52,895
The Dietrichson case?
Must be.

1001
01:00:53,062 --> 01:00:55,022
Anything wrong?
Well, the guy is dead.

1002
01:00:55,106 --> 01:00:58,985
We had him insured and it's gonna
cost us dough. That's always wrong.

1003
01:00:59,068 --> 01:01:01,321
What have they got so far?
Autopsy report.

1004
01:01:01,404 --> 01:01:05,033
No heart failure, no apoplexy, no
predisposing medical cause of any kind.

1005
01:01:05,116 --> 01:01:06,951
Died of a broken neck.

1006
01:01:07,118 --> 01:01:09,120
When's the inquest?
Had it this morning.

1007
01:01:09,204 --> 01:01:11,289
His wife and daughter
made the identification.

1008
01:01:11,331 --> 01:01:14,125
The train people and some of the
passengers told how he went through...

1009
01:01:14,209 --> 01:01:15,460
to the observation car.

1010
01:01:15,544 --> 01:01:19,131
It was all over in 45 minutes.
Verdict? Accidental death.

1011
01:01:20,716 --> 01:01:22,175
What do the police figure?

1012
01:01:22,259 --> 01:01:24,928
That he got tangled up in his
crutches and fell off the train.

1013
01:01:25,012 --> 01:01:26,638
They're satisfied.

1014
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:29,308
It's not their dough.
Come on, Walter.

1015
01:01:30,809 --> 01:01:32,644
(Norton) All right. Thank
you very much, gentlemen.

1016
01:01:32,811 --> 01:01:34,980
I believe the legal position
is now clear.

1017
01:01:35,022 --> 01:01:37,358
Please stand by.
I may need you later.

1018
01:01:37,441 --> 01:01:40,319
Come in, Mr. Keyes.
You, too, Mr. Neff.

1019
01:01:44,657 --> 01:01:46,951
You find this an uncomfortably
warm day, Mr. Keyes?

1020
01:01:47,034 --> 01:01:49,996
I'm sorry, Mr. Norton, but I
didn't know this was formal.

1021
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:51,455
Sit down, gentlemen.
Thank you.

1022
01:01:51,539 --> 01:01:52,540
Any new developments?

1023
01:01:52,623 --> 01:01:55,251
I just talked to this Jackson long
distance, up in Medford, Oregon.

1024
01:01:55,334 --> 01:01:56,335
Who's Jackson?

1025
01:01:56,419 --> 01:01:57,962
He's the last man who saw
Dietrichson alive.

1026
01:01:58,046 --> 01:02:00,590
They were out on the observation
platform together, talking.

1027
01:02:00,673 --> 01:02:02,717
Dietrichson wanted a cigar
and so Jackson went back...

1028
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,469
to get Dietrichson's
cigar case for him.

1029
01:02:04,552 --> 01:02:06,888
When he returned to the observation
platform, no Dietrichson.

1030
01:02:06,971 --> 01:02:08,848
Well, Jackson didn't think
anything was wrong until...

1031
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:10,892
a wire caught up with
the train at Santa Barbara.

1032
01:02:10,934 --> 01:02:13,687
They found Dietrichson's body
on the tracks near Burbank.

1033
01:02:13,728 --> 01:02:16,231
Very interesting about
the cigar case.

1034
01:02:16,314 --> 01:02:18,316
Anything else?
No, not much.

1035
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,361
Dietrichson's secretary says she
didn't know anything about the policy.

1036
01:02:21,445 --> 01:02:24,823
There's a daughter, but all she
remembers is Neff talking to her father...

1037
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:27,117
about accident insurance
at their house one night.

1038
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:28,535
I couldn't sell him at first.

1039
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:31,580
Mr. Dietrichson opposed it.
He said he'd think it over.

1040
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:34,833
Later I saw him in the
oil fields and closed him.

1041
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,919
He signed the application
and gave me his check.

1042
01:02:37,002 --> 01:02:39,380
A fine piece of salesmanship
that was, Mr. Neff.

1043
01:02:39,463 --> 01:02:41,090
Well, there's no sense in
pushing Neff around.

1044
01:02:41,173 --> 01:02:43,134
He's got the best
sales record in the office.

1045
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:46,470
Are your salesmen supposed to know a
customer is going to fall off the train?

1046
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:50,349
Fall off a train? Are we sure
Dietrichson fell off the train?

1047
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:53,019
I don't get it.
You don't, Mr. Keyes?

1048
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:54,562
Then what do you
think of this case?

1049
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:56,397
This policy might cost us
a great deal of money.

1050
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:58,608
As you know, it contains
a double indemnity clause.

1051
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:00,443
Just what is your opinion?

1052
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:02,237
No opinion at all.
Not even a hunch?

1053
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,697
One of those interesting
little hunches of yours?

1054
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,074
Nope. Not even a hunch.

1055
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:09,869
I'm surprised, Mr. Keyes. I've
formed a very definite opinion.

1056
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:13,582
I think I know. In fact, I know I
know what happened to Dietrichson.

1057
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:17,044
You know you know what?
I know it was not an accident.

1058
01:03:20,422 --> 01:03:22,966
What do you say to that?
Me?

1059
01:03:24,343 --> 01:03:26,762
Well, you've got the ball.
Let's see you run with it.

1060
01:03:26,804 --> 01:03:30,391
There's a widespread feeling that just
because a man has a large office...

1061
01:03:30,474 --> 01:03:31,600
[intercom buzzing]

1062
01:03:33,477 --> 01:03:36,146
Yes? Have her come in, please.

1063
01:03:36,689 --> 01:03:38,232
There's a widespread
feeling that...

1064
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:41,610
just because a man has a large
office, he must be an idiot.

1065
01:03:41,694 --> 01:03:43,654
I'm having a visitor,
if you don't mind.

1066
01:03:43,696 --> 01:03:46,657
No, no. I want you to stay
and watch me handle this.

1067
01:03:46,741 --> 01:03:48,367
Mrs. Dietrichson.

1068
01:03:52,538 --> 01:03:54,958
Thank you very much
for coming, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1069
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:57,794
I assure you I appreciate
it. This is Mr. Keyes.

1070
01:03:57,877 --> 01:03:59,337
How do you do?
How do you do?

1071
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:01,423
And Mr. Neff. I've met
Mr. Neff. How do you do?

1072
01:04:01,506 --> 01:04:04,092
Mrs. Dietrichson.
Won't you sit down?

1073
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,555
(Norton) May I extend our
sympathy in your bereavement?

1074
01:04:08,638 --> 01:04:11,099
I hesitated before asking you to
come here so soon after your loss.

1075
01:04:11,183 --> 01:04:14,853
But now that you're here I hope you won't
mind if I plunge straight into business?

1076
01:04:14,936 --> 01:04:16,480
You know why we asked
you to come, don't you?

1077
01:04:16,563 --> 01:04:19,149
No. All I know is that your
secretary made it sound very urgent.

1078
01:04:19,232 --> 01:04:21,360
Your husband had an accident
policy with this company.

1079
01:04:21,443 --> 01:04:23,153
Evidently you don't know that,
Mrs. Dietrichson.

1080
01:04:23,195 --> 01:04:25,948
No. I remember some talk at the
house, but he didn't seem to want it.

1081
01:04:26,031 --> 01:04:29,326
Your husband took the policy out
a few days later, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1082
01:04:29,368 --> 01:04:31,870
You'll probably find the policy
among his personal effects.

1083
01:04:31,954 --> 01:04:33,706
His safe-deposit box
hasn't been opened yet.

1084
01:04:33,789 --> 01:04:35,791
It seems a tax examiner
has to be present.

1085
01:04:35,875 --> 01:04:37,543
Please, Mrs. Dietrichson,
I don't want you to think...

1086
01:04:37,626 --> 01:04:39,045
you're being subjected to
any questioning...

1087
01:04:39,128 --> 01:04:40,755
but there are a few things
we should like to know.

1088
01:04:40,838 --> 01:04:41,839
What sort of things?

1089
01:04:42,256 --> 01:04:44,425
We have the report of
the coroner's inquest.

1090
01:04:44,508 --> 01:04:47,553
Accidental death.
We are not entirely satisfied.

1091
01:04:47,637 --> 01:04:50,223
In fact,
we are not satisfied at all.

1092
01:04:52,183 --> 01:04:54,811
Frankly, Mrs. Dietrichson,
we suspect...

1093
01:04:56,062 --> 01:04:57,355
a suicide.

1094
01:05:00,775 --> 01:05:04,154
I'm sorry. Would you like
a glass of water? Please.

1095
01:05:08,909 --> 01:05:10,243
Thank you.

1096
01:05:16,249 --> 01:05:19,795
Had your husband been depressed
or moody lately, Mrs. Dietrichson?

1097
01:05:19,878 --> 01:05:22,631
Did he have financial worries,
for instance?

1098
01:05:22,714 --> 01:05:26,051
He was perfectly all right and I
don't know of any financial worries.

1099
01:05:26,093 --> 01:05:28,220
Let us examine this
so-called accident.

1100
01:05:28,304 --> 01:05:32,433
First, your husband takes out this
policy in absolute secrecy. Why?

1101
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,519
Because he doesn't want his family
to suspect what he intends to do.

1102
01:05:35,603 --> 01:05:38,230
Do what? Next, he goes on
this trip entirely alone.

1103
01:05:38,314 --> 01:05:41,901
He has to be alone. He hobbles all the
way out to the observation platform.

1104
01:05:41,984 --> 01:05:45,655
Very unlikely with his leg in a cast,
unless he has a very strong reason.

1105
01:05:45,905 --> 01:05:48,991
Once there, he finds he is not
alone. There is a man there.

1106
01:05:49,075 --> 01:05:52,787
What was his name, Keyes? His name
was Jackson. Probably still is.

1107
01:05:53,288 --> 01:05:57,000
So he gets rid of this Jackson with
some flimsy excuse about cigars.

1108
01:05:57,083 --> 01:06:00,378
And then he is alone. And
then he does it. Does what?

1109
01:06:00,462 --> 01:06:04,132
He jumps. Suicide. In which
case, the company is not liable.

1110
01:06:04,507 --> 01:06:07,385
You know that, of course.
Now, we could go to court...

1111
01:06:07,469 --> 01:06:11,264
I don't know anything. In fact,
I don't know why I came here.

1112
01:06:11,473 --> 01:06:14,768
Just a moment, please. I said we could
go to court. I didn't say we want to.

1113
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:17,729
What I want to suggest is
a compromise on both sides.

1114
01:06:17,813 --> 01:06:20,274
A settlement for a certain
sum, a part of the policy value.

1115
01:06:20,315 --> 01:06:24,028
Don't bother, Mr. Norton. When I came in
here, I had no idea you owed me any money.

1116
01:06:24,111 --> 01:06:26,113
You told me you did.
Then you told me you didn't.

1117
01:06:26,196 --> 01:06:28,616
Now you tell me you want to pay
me a part of it, whatever it is.

1118
01:06:28,699 --> 01:06:31,035
You want to bargain with me,
at a time like this.

1119
01:06:31,118 --> 01:06:34,455
I don't like your insinuations about my
husband, and I don't like your methods.

1120
01:06:34,538 --> 01:06:38,292
In fact, I don't like you,
Mr. Norton. Goodbye, gentlemen.

1121
01:06:41,379 --> 01:06:42,421
[Door slamming]

1122
01:06:43,089 --> 01:06:46,342
(Keyes) Nice going, Mr. Norton.
You sure carried that ball.

1123
01:06:46,426 --> 01:06:47,802
Only you fumbled
on the goal line.

1124
01:06:47,844 --> 01:06:51,055
Then you heaved an illegal forward
pass and got thrown for a 40-yard loss.

1125
01:06:51,139 --> 01:06:54,058
Now you can't pick yourself up because
you haven't got a leg to stand on.

1126
01:06:54,142 --> 01:06:57,145
I haven't, eh? She can go to court
and we can prove it was suicide.

1127
01:06:57,228 --> 01:06:58,730
Oh, can we?

1128
01:06:58,813 --> 01:07:02,651
Mr. Norton, the first thing that
struck me was that suicide angle.

1129
01:07:02,692 --> 01:07:06,446
Only I dumped it into the wastepaper
basket just three seconds later.

1130
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:10,075
You know, you ought to take a look
at the statistics on suicide sometime.

1131
01:07:10,158 --> 01:07:12,619
You might learn a little something
about the insurance business.

1132
01:07:12,703 --> 01:07:14,830
Mr. Keyes, I was raised
in the insurance business.

1133
01:07:14,872 --> 01:07:16,665
Yeah, in the front office.

1134
01:07:16,707 --> 01:07:19,877
Come now, you've never read an
actuarial table in your life, have you?

1135
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,212
Why, they've got 10 volumes
on suicide alone.

1136
01:07:22,296 --> 01:07:24,089
Suicide by race, by color,
by occupation...

1137
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:26,133
by sex, by seasons of
the year, by time of day.

1138
01:07:26,217 --> 01:07:29,595
Suicide, how committed? By poisons,
by firearms, by drowning, by leaps.

1139
01:07:29,678 --> 01:07:32,348
Suicide by poison, subdivided
by types of poison...

1140
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:35,017
such as corrosive, irritant,
systemic, gaseous, narcotic...

1141
01:07:35,101 --> 01:07:36,560
alkaloid, protein,
and so forth.

1142
01:07:36,644 --> 01:07:39,355
Suicide by leaps, subdivided
by leaps from high places...

1143
01:07:39,397 --> 01:07:41,524
under the wheels of trains,
under the wheels of trucks...

1144
01:07:41,607 --> 01:07:44,861
under the feet of horses, from
steamboats. But, Mr. Norton...

1145
01:07:45,111 --> 01:07:48,656
of all the cases on record there's not
one single case of suicide by leap...

1146
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:50,074
from the rear end
of a moving train.

1147
01:07:50,158 --> 01:07:51,910
And do you know how fast
that train was going...

1148
01:07:51,993 --> 01:07:54,954
at the point where the body
was found? 15 miles an hour.

1149
01:07:55,038 --> 01:07:57,207
Now how can anybody jump off
a slow moving train like that...

1150
01:07:57,248 --> 01:08:00,126
with any kind of expectation
that he would kill himself?

1151
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:01,878
No. No soap, Mr. Norton.

1152
01:08:01,962 --> 01:08:05,048
We're sunk, and we'll have to pay
through the nose, and you know it.

1153
01:08:05,132 --> 01:08:06,717
May I have this?

1154
01:08:10,095 --> 01:08:11,680
Come on, Walter.

1155
01:08:14,808 --> 01:08:17,019
Next time I'll rent a tuxedo.

1156
01:08:33,452 --> 01:08:35,913
<i>(Walter) I could have hugged you
right then and there, Keyes...</i>

1157
01:08:35,955 --> 01:08:37,540
<i>you and your statistics.</i>

1158
01:08:37,623 --> 01:08:40,334
<i>You were the only one
we were really scared of...</i>

1159
01:08:40,418 --> 01:08:43,129
<i>and instead you were
almost playing on our team.</i>

1160
01:08:43,338 --> 01:08:46,382
<i>That evening when I got home,
my nerves had eased off.</i>

1161
01:08:46,466 --> 01:08:48,468
<i>I could feel the ground
under my feet again.</i>

1162
01:08:48,551 --> 01:08:51,346
<i>And it looked like easy going
from there on in.</i>

1163
01:08:51,429 --> 01:08:53,681
<i>That $100,000 looked
as safe for Phyllis and me...</i>

1164
01:08:53,765 --> 01:08:56,434
<i>as if we had the check
already deposited in the bank.</i>

1165
01:08:56,476 --> 01:08:58,103
[Phone ringing]

1166
01:09:02,816 --> 01:09:07,237
Hello? Oh, hello, baby.
Sure, everything is fine.

1167
01:09:08,071 --> 01:09:09,615
You were wonderful
in Norton's office.

1168
01:09:09,698 --> 01:09:12,951
I felt so funny, I wanted to
look at you all the time.

1169
01:09:12,993 --> 01:09:15,537
How do you think I felt, baby?
Where are you?

1170
01:09:15,621 --> 01:09:18,207
At the drugstore.
Just a block away.

1171
01:09:18,457 --> 01:09:20,542
Can I come up?
Okay. But be careful.

1172
01:09:20,626 --> 01:09:22,378
Don't let anybody see you.

1173
01:09:33,723 --> 01:09:35,433
[Doorbell ringing]

1174
01:09:48,696 --> 01:09:50,156
Hello, Keyes.

1175
01:09:55,829 --> 01:09:58,456
What's on your mind?
That broken leg.

1176
01:09:58,999 --> 01:10:02,085
The guy had a broken leg.
What are you talking about?

1177
01:10:02,169 --> 01:10:05,672
Talking about Dietrichson. He
had accident insurance, didn't he?

1178
01:10:05,964 --> 01:10:08,008
Yeah. Then he broke his leg, didn't he?

1179
01:10:08,091 --> 01:10:10,052
So what?
And he didn't put in a claim.

1180
01:10:10,093 --> 01:10:13,847
Why didn't he put in a claim?
Why? What are you driving at?

1181
01:10:14,056 --> 01:10:18,852
Walter, I had dinner two hours
ago and it stuck half way.

1182
01:10:18,894 --> 01:10:20,604
That little man of yours
is acting up again, huh?

1183
01:10:20,688 --> 01:10:23,023
There's something wrong
with the Dietrichson case.

1184
01:10:23,065 --> 01:10:26,902
Why? Because he didn't file a claim?
Maybe he just didn't have time.

1185
01:10:26,986 --> 01:10:29,989
Maybe he just didn't know that
he was insured.

1186
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:33,659
No. No, that couldn't be it.

1187
01:10:33,743 --> 01:10:35,912
You delivered the policy
to him personally, didn't you?

1188
01:10:35,995 --> 01:10:36,996
Yeah.
You got his check?

1189
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,247
Sure I did.

1190
01:10:39,082 --> 01:10:42,001
Got any bicarbonate of soda?
No, I haven't.

1191
01:10:42,752 --> 01:10:46,381
Walter, I've been living with
this little man for 26 years.

1192
01:10:46,923 --> 01:10:49,551
And he's never failed me yet.
There's got to be something wrong.

1193
01:10:49,634 --> 01:10:52,053
Well, maybe Norton was right.
Maybe it was suicide.

1194
01:10:52,137 --> 01:10:53,722
No. Not suicide.

1195
01:10:54,347 --> 01:10:57,392
But not an accident, either.
What else?

1196
01:10:57,934 --> 01:10:59,186
Now look, Walter.

1197
01:10:59,269 --> 01:11:02,230
A guy takes out an accident
policy that's worth $100,000...

1198
01:11:02,272 --> 01:11:03,357
if he's killed on a train.

1199
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,317
Then two weeks later,
he is killed on a train.

1200
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:09,363
And not in a train accident, mind you,
but falling off some silly observation car.

1201
01:11:09,446 --> 01:11:12,116
Do you know what the mathematical
probability of that is?

1202
01:11:12,199 --> 01:11:15,077
One out of I don't know
how many billions.

1203
01:11:15,869 --> 01:11:20,541
And add to that the broken leg. No,
it just can't be the way it looks.

1204
01:11:21,083 --> 01:11:25,087
Something has been worked
on us. Such as what?

1205
01:11:33,137 --> 01:11:34,305
Murder?

1206
01:11:34,806 --> 01:11:36,682
Don't you have any peppermint
or something?

1207
01:11:36,766 --> 01:11:39,560
Sorry. Want a little
soda water? No, no, no.

1208
01:11:40,937 --> 01:11:41,896
(Walter)
Who do you suspect?

1209
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:43,940
(Keyes) Maybe I like to
make things easy for myself.

1210
01:11:43,982 --> 01:11:46,025
But I always tend to suspect
the beneficiary.

1211
01:11:46,109 --> 01:11:47,193
You mean the wife?
Yeah.

1212
01:11:47,277 --> 01:11:49,821
That wide-eyed dame that just
didn't know anything about anything.

1213
01:11:49,904 --> 01:11:51,906
You're crazy, Keyes.
She wasn't even on the train.

1214
01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:53,283
I know she wasn't, Walter.

1215
01:11:53,325 --> 01:11:55,577
I don't claim to know how it
was worked, or who worked it...

1216
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:58,080
but all I know is that
it was worked.

1217
01:11:58,163 --> 01:11:59,873
I've got to
get to a drugstore.

1218
01:11:59,956 --> 01:12:02,918
This thing feels like
a hunk of concrete inside me.

1219
01:12:03,001 --> 01:12:05,671
Good night, Walter.
Good night, Keyes.

1220
01:12:06,004 --> 01:12:08,966
See you at the office
in the morning. Yeah.

1221
01:12:10,008 --> 01:12:12,594
I'd like to move in on her
right now, tonight.

1222
01:12:12,678 --> 01:12:16,807
If it wasn't for Norton and his
striped-pants ideas about company policy...

1223
01:12:16,891 --> 01:12:19,560
I'd have the police after her
so fast it'd make her head spin.

1224
01:12:19,643 --> 01:12:21,187
They'd put her
through the wringer...

1225
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:24,106
and, brother, the things
they would squeeze out.

1226
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:26,192
Only you haven't got a
single thing to go on, Keyes.

1227
01:12:26,275 --> 01:12:28,569
Not too much.
Just 26 years experience...

1228
01:12:28,653 --> 01:12:32,865
all the percentage there is, and
this hunk of concrete in my stomach.

1229
01:12:35,034 --> 01:12:37,328
Can I have
one of those things?

1230
01:12:48,173 --> 01:12:50,634
Good night, Keyes.
So long, Walter.

1231
01:12:54,262 --> 01:12:55,430
[Elevator door shuts]

1232
01:13:04,064 --> 01:13:07,276
How much does he know?
He doesn't know anything.

1233
01:13:07,901 --> 01:13:10,070
It's those stinking
hunches of his.

1234
01:13:10,154 --> 01:13:11,488
And he can't prove anything,
can he?

1235
01:13:11,572 --> 01:13:15,534
Not if we're careful. Not if we
don't see each other for a while.

1236
01:13:17,578 --> 01:13:20,122
How long a while?
Until this dies down.

1237
01:13:20,206 --> 01:13:21,165
You don't know Keyes.

1238
01:13:21,248 --> 01:13:23,334
Once he gets his teeth into
something, he never lets go.

1239
01:13:23,417 --> 01:13:25,086
He'll investigate you,
have you shadowed.

1240
01:13:25,169 --> 01:13:27,964
He'll watch you
every minute from now on.

1241
01:13:28,047 --> 01:13:30,508
You afraid, baby?
Yes, I'm afraid.

1242
01:13:31,634 --> 01:13:35,596
But not of Keyes. I'm afraid of
us. We're not the same anymore.

1243
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:38,850
We did it so we could be together, but
instead of that it's pulling us apart.

1244
01:13:38,933 --> 01:13:40,685
Isn't it, Walter?
What are you talking about?

1245
01:13:40,768 --> 01:13:44,439
And you don't really care
whether we see each other or not.

1246
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:47,400
Shut up, baby.

Hello, Mr. Neff.

Hello.

Don't you remember me?
Yes. Yes, of course.

Could I talk with you
just a few minutes?

1252
01:14:06,712 --> 01:14:09,131
Somewhere where
we could be alone?

1253
01:14:09,381 --> 01:14:11,592
Oh, yes. Come into my office.

1254
01:14:17,932 --> 01:14:20,101
Is it something about
what happened?

1255
01:14:20,142 --> 01:14:23,771
Yes, Mr. Neff.
It's about my father's death.

I'm terribly sorry,
Miss Dietrichson.

office alone for a few minutes?

1258

No. It's all yours, Walter.

1259

Look at me, Mr. Neff.

1260
01:14:43,333 --> 01:14:46,795
I'm not crazy. I'm not
hysterical. I'm not even crying.

1261
01:14:47,879 --> 01:14:51,341
But I have the awful feeling
that something is wrong...

1262
01:14:51,675 --> 01:14:55,470
and I had that same feeling
once before, when my mother died.

1263
01:14:55,512 --> 01:14:56,555
When your mother died?

1264
01:14:56,638 --> 01:14:59,016
We were at Lake Arrowhead.
That was six years ago.

1265
01:14:59,099 --> 01:15:00,100
We had a cabin there.

1266
01:15:00,184 --> 01:15:04,480
It was winter and very cold. My
mother was very sick with pneumonia.

1267
01:15:04,813 --> 01:15:06,523
She had a nurse with her.

1268
01:15:06,648 --> 01:15:09,610
There were just
the three of us in the cabin.

1269
01:15:09,735 --> 01:15:12,446
One night I got up and
went into my mother's room.

1270
01:15:12,530 --> 01:15:14,365
She was delirious with fever.

1271
01:15:14,448 --> 01:15:18,160
All the bed covers were on the
floor and the windows were wide open.

1272
01:15:18,244 --> 01:15:19,412
The nurse wasn't in the room.

1273
01:15:19,495 --> 01:15:21,664
I ran and covered my mother up
as quickly as I could.

1274
01:15:21,747 --> 01:15:24,500
Just then I heard
a door open behind me.

1275
01:15:25,126 --> 01:15:27,003
The nurse stood there.

1276
01:15:27,545 --> 01:15:31,174
She didn't say a word, but
there was a look in her eyes...

1277
01:15:31,341 --> 01:15:33,009
I'll never forget.

1278
01:15:35,053 --> 01:15:38,181
Two days later,
my mother was dead.

1279
01:15:41,476 --> 01:15:43,812
Do you know who
that nurse was?

1280
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:45,689
No. Who?
Phyllis.

1281
01:15:46,147 --> 01:15:48,525
I tried to tell my father,
but I was just a kid then.

1282
01:15:48,567 --> 01:15:51,737
He wouldn't listen to me. Six
months later she married him...

1283
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:56,199
and I kind of talked myself out of the
idea she could have done anything like that.

1284
01:15:56,283 --> 01:16:00,746
But now it's all back again, now that
something's happened to my father, too.

1285
01:16:00,829 --> 01:16:04,667
You're not making sense, Miss
Dietrichson. Your father fell off a train.

1286
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:07,753
Yes, and two days before he fell off
that train, what was Phyllis doing?

1287
01:16:07,836 --> 01:16:10,339
She was in her room in front of
a mirror, with a black hat on...

1288
01:16:10,422 --> 01:16:11,715
pinning a black veil to it.

1289
01:16:11,799 --> 01:16:15,219
As if she couldn't wait to see
how she would look in mourning.

1290
01:16:15,302 --> 01:16:17,346
You've had a pretty bad shock,
Miss Dietrichson.

1291
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:19,056
Aren't you just
imagining these things?

1292
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:20,558
I caught her eyes
in the mirror.

1293
01:16:20,641 --> 01:16:23,686
They had that look in them
they had before my mother died.

1294
01:16:23,769 --> 01:16:25,229
That same look.

1295
01:16:25,938 --> 01:16:27,732
You don't like
your stepmother, do you?

1296
01:16:27,774 --> 01:16:29,609
Isn't it just because
she is your stepmother?

1297
01:16:29,692 --> 01:16:32,111
I loathe her because she did
it. She did it for the money.

1298
01:16:32,195 --> 01:16:34,531
Only you're not going to
pay her, are you, Mr. Neff?

1299
01:16:34,614 --> 01:16:37,742
She's not going to get away with it
this time, because I'm going to speak up.

1300
01:16:37,784 --> 01:16:39,285
I'm going to
tell everything I know.

1301
01:16:39,369 --> 01:16:43,707
You'd better be careful, saying things
like... I'm not afraid. You'll see.

1302
01:16:44,791 --> 01:16:46,168
[Sobbing]

1303
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:53,342
I'm sorry.

1304
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:59,014
I didn't mean to
act like this.

1305
01:17:00,307 --> 01:17:03,352
All this that you've been telling
me, who else have you told?

1306
01:17:03,435 --> 01:17:04,603
No one.

1307
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:07,231
How about your stepmother?
Of course not.

1308
01:17:08,232 --> 01:17:09,733
I've moved out.

1309
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:12,987
I'm not living
at home anymore.

1310
01:17:13,070 --> 01:17:15,614
And you haven't told that
boyfriend of yours? Zachetti?

1311
01:17:15,698 --> 01:17:18,618
I'm not seeing him anymore.
We had a fight.

1312
01:17:20,203 --> 01:17:22,038
Where are you living now?

1313
01:17:22,121 --> 01:17:25,083
I got myself a little
apartment in Hollywood.

1314
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:28,336
Four walls, and you just
sit and look at them?

1315
01:17:29,212 --> 01:17:30,713
Yes, Mr. Neff.

1316
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:35,093
<i>(Walter) So that evening
I took her to dinner...</i>

1317
01:17:35,176 --> 01:17:38,805
<i>at a Mexican restaurant down on Olvera
Street where nobody would see us.</i>

1318
01:17:38,888 --> 01:17:40,890
<i>I wanted to cheer her up.</i>

1319
01:17:41,308 --> 01:17:44,728
<i>The next day was Sunday and we
went for a ride down to the beach.</i>

1320
01:17:44,811 --> 01:17:47,522
<i>She had loosened up a bit,
she was even laughing.</i>

1321
01:17:47,606 --> 01:17:51,151
<i>I had to make sure that she wouldn't tell
that stuff about Phyllis to anybody else.</i>

1322
01:17:51,234 --> 01:17:54,154
<i>It was dynamite,
whether it was true or not.</i>

1323
01:17:54,363 --> 01:17:56,198
<i>And I had no chance
to talk to Phyllis.</i>

1324
01:17:56,281 --> 01:17:58,492
<i>You were watching her
like a hawk, Keyes.</i>

1325
01:17:58,534 --> 01:18:02,871
<i>I couldn't even phone her because I
was afraid you had the wires tapped.</i>

1326
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:07,084
<i>Monday morning there was a note on my
desk that you wanted to see me, Keyes.</i>

1327
01:18:07,168 --> 01:18:10,129
<i>For a minute I wondered
if it could be about Lola.</i>

1328
01:18:10,212 --> 01:18:11,672
<i>It was worse.</i>

1329
01:18:12,214 --> 01:18:16,177
<i>Outside your door was the last
guy in the world I wanted to see.</i>

1330
01:18:25,353 --> 01:18:27,313
Come in. Come in, Walter.

1331
01:18:28,856 --> 01:18:31,734
Hello, Keyes.
I want to ask you something.

1332
01:18:32,193 --> 01:18:34,028
After all the years
we've known each other...

1333
01:18:34,112 --> 01:18:36,031
do you mind if I make
a rather blunt statement?

1334
01:18:36,114 --> 01:18:37,699
About what?
About me.

1335
01:18:38,325 --> 01:18:40,994
Walter, I'm a very great man.
Yeah?

1336
01:18:41,077 --> 01:18:43,830
This Dietrichson business,
it's murder...

1337
01:18:43,914 --> 01:18:45,874
and murders don't come
any neater.

1338
01:18:45,957 --> 01:18:48,835
As fancy a piece of homicide
as anybody ever ran into...

1339
01:18:48,919 --> 01:18:51,171
smart, tricky,
almost perfect, but...

1340
01:18:52,089 --> 01:18:54,550
I think Papa has it
all figured out.

1341
01:18:54,591 --> 01:18:58,429
Figured out and wrapped up in
tissue paper with pink ribbons on it.

1342
01:18:58,512 --> 01:19:01,223
Go ahead. I'm listening.
You know what?

1343
01:19:01,599 --> 01:19:04,560
That guy Dietrichson
was never on the train.

1344
01:19:05,728 --> 01:19:07,730
He wasn't?
No, he wasn't.

1345
01:19:09,315 --> 01:19:11,609
Now look, Walter. You can't
be sure of killing a man...

1346
01:19:11,692 --> 01:19:14,820
by throwing him off a train
that's going 15 miles an hour.

1347
01:19:14,904 --> 01:19:17,365
The only way you can be sure
is to kill him first...

1348
01:19:17,448 --> 01:19:19,367
and then throw
his body on the tracks.

1349
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:21,619
Now that would mean either
killing him on the train...

1350
01:19:21,703 --> 01:19:25,415
or, and this is where it really gets
fancy, you kill him somewhere else...

1351
01:19:25,498 --> 01:19:26,708
and put him on the tracks.

1352
01:19:26,791 --> 01:19:30,044
Two possibilities, and I
personally buy the second.

1353
01:19:31,296 --> 01:19:32,797
You're way ahead of me,
Keyes.

1354
01:19:32,922 --> 01:19:34,674
Well, look, Walter,
it was like this.

1355
01:19:34,966 --> 01:19:38,595
They killed the guy, the wife
and a somebody else...

1356
01:19:38,887 --> 01:19:42,265
and the somebody else took the crutches
and went on the train as Dietrichson...

1357
01:19:42,349 --> 01:19:44,101
then the somebody
else jumped off...

1358
01:19:44,184 --> 01:19:46,728
then they put the body on the
tracks where the train had passed.

1359
01:19:46,812 --> 01:19:49,481
An impersonation, see?
A cinch to work.

1360
01:19:50,315 --> 01:19:52,442
Because it was night,
very few people were about...

1361
01:19:52,484 --> 01:19:54,027
they have the crutches
to stare at...

1362
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:56,572
they never really looked
at the man at all.

1363
01:19:56,655 --> 01:19:58,782
Fancy all right, Keyes, but
maybe it's a little too fancy.

1364
01:19:58,866 --> 01:20:02,244
Is it? I tell you, it all
fits together like a watch.

1365
01:20:02,912 --> 01:20:04,789
Now let's see what we have
in the way of proof.

1366
01:20:04,872 --> 01:20:07,792
The only guy who really got a good
look at this supposed Dietrichson...

1367
01:20:07,833 --> 01:20:09,961
is sitting
right outside my office.

1368
01:20:10,044 --> 01:20:13,464
I took the trouble to bring
him down here from Oregon.

1369
01:20:15,216 --> 01:20:18,052
Come here, Mr. Jackson.
Yes, sir, Mr. Keyes.

1370
01:20:18,136 --> 01:20:19,804
These are fine cigars
you smoke.

1371
01:20:19,887 --> 01:20:21,639
Two for a quarter.
That's what I said.

1372
01:20:21,681 --> 01:20:23,266
Well, did you study
those photographs?

1373
01:20:23,349 --> 01:20:25,351
Yes, indeed.
I studied them thoroughly.

1374
01:20:25,435 --> 01:20:27,270
Very thoroughly.
Have you made up your mind?

1375
01:20:27,353 --> 01:20:29,314
Mister Keyes, I'm a Medford
man. Medford, Oregon.

1376
01:20:29,397 --> 01:20:31,566
Up in Medford we take our time
making up our mind.

1377
01:20:31,649 --> 01:20:34,653
Well, we're not in Medford now.
We're in a hurry. Let's have it.

1378
01:20:34,736 --> 01:20:36,988
Are these photographs
of the late Mr. Dietrichson?

1379
01:20:37,030 --> 01:20:38,031
Yes.

1380
01:20:38,573 --> 01:20:40,784
Then my answer is no.
What do you mean, no?

1381
01:20:40,867 --> 01:20:43,036
I mean, this is not
the man that was on the train.

1382
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,329
Will you swear to that?

1383
01:20:44,371 --> 01:20:46,373
Mr. Keyes, I'm a Medford man.
Medford, Oregon.

1384
01:20:46,456 --> 01:20:48,834
If I say it, I mean it. If I
mean it, of course I'll swear it.

1385
01:20:48,876 --> 01:20:50,502
There you are, Walter.
There's your proof.

1386
01:20:50,586 --> 01:20:52,254
This is Mr. Neff,
one of our salesmen.

1387
01:20:52,337 --> 01:20:54,298
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Neff.
Pleased, indeed.

1388
01:20:54,381 --> 01:20:55,758
How are you?
Very fine, thank you.

1389
01:20:55,841 --> 01:20:58,177
Never was better.
Sit down, Mr. Jackson.

1390
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:01,639
Just how would you describe the man
you saw on the observation platform?

1391
01:21:01,722 --> 01:21:04,433
Well, I'm pretty sure
he was a younger man...

1392
01:21:04,558 --> 01:21:07,520
about 10 or 15 years younger
than the man in these photographs.

1393
01:21:07,561 --> 01:21:09,605
Dietrichson was about 50,
wasn't he, Walter?

1394
01:21:09,689 --> 01:21:12,066
Fifty-one,
according to the policy.

1395
01:21:12,149 --> 01:21:15,027
The man I saw was nothing like
51 years old.

1396
01:21:15,236 --> 01:21:17,739
Of course, it was pretty dark
out on that platform.

1397
01:21:17,822 --> 01:21:20,074
Come to think of it, he tried
to keep his back towards me.

1398
01:21:20,158 --> 01:21:22,785
But I'm positive just the
same. Thank you, Jackson.

1399
01:21:22,869 --> 01:21:25,288
Of course, you understand this
matter is strictly confidential?

1400
01:21:25,371 --> 01:21:28,458
We may need you again down here in Los
Angeles, if the case comes to court.

1401
01:21:28,541 --> 01:21:31,294
Any time you need me, I'm entirely
at your disposal, gentlemen.

1402
01:21:31,378 --> 01:21:34,673
Expenses paid, of course.
Oh, yes. Yes. Of course.

1403
01:21:36,216 --> 01:21:38,885
Get me Lubin,
in the cashier's office.

1404
01:21:39,553 --> 01:21:41,596
Hello, Lubin. This is Keyes.

1405
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:45,767
Listen. I'm sending a man named Jackson
down to you with an expense account.

1406
01:21:45,851 --> 01:21:48,645
Well, we brought him down here from
Medford, Oregon in connection with...

1407
01:21:48,729 --> 01:21:50,481
the Dietrichson claim.

1408
01:21:51,565 --> 01:21:53,692
Well, take care of his
hotel bill, will you?

1409
01:21:53,776 --> 01:21:54,860
Ever been in Oregon, Mr. Neff?

1410
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:55,945
(Keyes)
Yeah. He'll be right down.

1411
01:21:56,028 --> 01:21:57,529
No. Never been up there.

1412
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:00,366
Wait a minute.
You go trout fishing?

1413
01:22:00,449 --> 01:22:04,078
Maybe I saw you up Klamath
Falls way. Nope. I don't fish.

1414
01:22:04,412 --> 01:22:07,707
You don't go fishing,
Mr. Neff. Neff. It's the name.

1415
01:22:08,249 --> 01:22:10,835
There's a family of Neffs
in Corvallis. No relation.

1416
01:22:10,918 --> 01:22:13,296
Let me see. This man's an
automobile dealer in Corvallis.

1417
01:22:13,379 --> 01:22:15,715
A very reputable man, too, I'm
told. All right, Mr. Jackson.

1418
01:22:15,798 --> 01:22:17,300
Suppose you go down to
the cashier's office.

1419
01:22:17,383 --> 01:22:18,843
Room 27 on the 11th floor.

1420
01:22:18,927 --> 01:22:22,222
He'll take care of your expense account
and your ticket for the train tonight.

1421
01:22:22,263 --> 01:22:23,264
Tonight?

1422
01:22:23,389 --> 01:22:26,601
Tomorrow morning would suit me better.
There's a very good osteopath in town...

1423
01:22:26,684 --> 01:22:29,479
I'd like to see before
I leave. Osteopath?

1424
01:22:30,021 --> 01:22:33,066
Well, just don't put her
on the expense account.

1425
01:22:33,984 --> 01:22:35,527
Well, goodbye, gentlemen.

1426
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:37,904
It's been a pleasure.
Goodbye.

1427
01:22:40,198 --> 01:22:44,119
There it is, Walter. It's beginning
to come apart at the seams already.

1428
01:22:44,203 --> 01:22:46,955
Murder's never perfect. Always
comes apart sooner or later.

1429
01:22:46,997 --> 01:22:49,458
And when two people are
involved, it's usually sooner.

1430
01:22:49,541 --> 01:22:52,461
Now, we know the Dietrichson dame
is in it, and a somebody else.

1431
01:22:52,503 --> 01:22:54,546
Pretty soon we'll know
who that somebody else is.

1432
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:57,466
He'll show. He's got to show. Sometime,
somewhere, they've got to meet.

1433
01:22:57,550 --> 01:22:58,843
Their emotions
are all kicked up.

1434
01:22:58,926 --> 01:23:02,346
Whether it's love or hate doesn't matter.
They can't keep away from each other.

1435
01:23:02,430 --> 01:23:04,890
They may think it's twice as safe
because there are two of them.

1436
01:23:04,974 --> 01:23:06,350
But it isn't twice as safe.

1437
01:23:06,434 --> 01:23:09,604
It's 10 times twice as dangerous.
They've committed a murder...

1438
01:23:09,687 --> 01:23:11,814
and it's not like taking
a trolley ride together...

1439
01:23:11,856 --> 01:23:13,649
where they can get off
at different stops.

1440
01:23:13,691 --> 01:23:15,985
They're stuck with each other
and they've got to ride...

1441
01:23:16,027 --> 01:23:17,487
all the way to
the end of the line.

1442
01:23:17,570 --> 01:23:19,906
And it's a one-way trip, and
the last stop is the cemetery.

1443
01:23:19,989 --> 01:23:21,783
She put in her claim.

1444
01:23:22,408 --> 01:23:24,994
I'm gonna throw it
right back at her.

1445
01:23:30,584 --> 01:23:32,335
Let her sue us if she dares.

1446
01:23:32,419 --> 01:23:35,213
I'll be ready for her
and that somebody else.

1447
01:23:35,297 --> 01:23:37,799
They'll be digging
their own graves.

1448
01:23:46,266 --> 01:23:48,936
Mrs. Dietrichson?
This is Jerry's Market.

1449
01:23:49,019 --> 01:23:51,981
We just got in a shipment of that
English soap you were asking about.

1450
01:23:52,064 --> 01:23:55,651
Will you be coming by today?
Thank you, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1451
01:24:22,721 --> 01:24:25,348
Hello, Walter.
Come over here.

1452
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:31,980
What's the matter?
Everything's the matter.

1453
01:24:34,024 --> 01:24:35,359
Keyes is rejecting your claim.

1454
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:38,028
He's sitting back with his mouth
watering, waiting for you to sue.

1455
01:24:38,111 --> 01:24:39,905
He wants you to sue,
but you're not going to.

1456
01:24:39,947 --> 01:24:42,866
What's he got to stop me?
He's got plenty.

1457
01:24:45,744 --> 01:24:47,079
He's figured out how
it was worked.

1458
01:24:47,162 --> 01:24:48,956
He knows it was somebody else
on the train...

1459
01:24:49,039 --> 01:24:50,874
and he's dug up a witness
he thinks can prove it.

1460
01:24:50,958 --> 01:24:53,294
Prove it how? If he rejects
that claim, I have to sue.

1461
01:24:53,377 --> 01:24:56,881
Yeah? And then you're in court and a
lot of other things are going to come up.

1462
01:24:56,964 --> 01:25:00,760
Like, for instance, about you
and the first Mrs. Dietrichson.

1463
01:25:00,968 --> 01:25:02,762
What about me and
the first Mrs. Dietrichson?

1464
01:25:02,845 --> 01:25:03,888
The way she died.

1465
01:25:03,971 --> 01:25:06,974
And about that black hat you were
trying on before you needed a black hat.

1466
01:25:07,058 --> 01:25:08,810
Lola's been telling you
some of her cockeyed stories.

1467
01:25:08,893 --> 01:25:11,229
She's been seeing you. I've been
seeing her, if you want to know.

1468
01:25:11,312 --> 01:25:12,981
So she won't yell her head off
about what she knows.

1469
01:25:13,064 --> 01:25:15,775
She's putting on an act for you, crying
all over your shoulder, the lying...

1470
01:25:15,859 --> 01:25:18,194
Keep her out of this. All I'm
telling you is we're not going to sue.

1471
01:25:18,278 --> 01:25:19,446
Because you don't want
the money anymore...

1472
01:25:19,529 --> 01:25:20,739
even if you could have it,
because she's...

1473
01:25:20,822 --> 01:25:21,990
made you feel like
a heel all of a sudden?

1474
01:25:22,073 --> 01:25:25,327
It isn't the money anymore. It's our
necks. We're pulling out, do you understand?

1475
01:25:25,410 --> 01:25:28,330
Because of what Keyes can do?
You're not fooling me, Walter.

1476
01:25:28,413 --> 01:25:30,665
It's because of Lola,
what you did to her father.

1477
01:25:30,749 --> 01:25:33,627
You're afraid she might find out
someday and you can't take it, can you?

1478
01:25:33,669 --> 01:25:35,629
I said, leave her out of this.

1479
01:25:40,592 --> 01:25:41,844
It's me I'm talking about.

1480
01:25:41,927 --> 01:25:44,096
I don't want to be left
out of it. Stop saying that.

1481
01:25:44,179 --> 01:25:45,556
It's just that it
hasn't worked as we wanted.

1482
01:25:45,639 --> 01:25:48,267
We can't go through with it, that's
all. We have gone through with it.

1483
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:49,435
The tough part
is all behind us.

1484
01:25:49,518 --> 01:25:51,979
We just have to hold on now
and not go soft inside...

1485
01:25:52,396 --> 01:25:54,815
stick close together
the way we started out.

1486
01:25:54,857 --> 01:25:56,150
Watch it.

1487
01:26:13,918 --> 01:26:16,504
I loved you, Walter,
and I hated him.

1488
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:20,091
But I wasn't going to do anything
about it, not until I met you.

1489
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:23,803
You planned the whole thing.
I only wanted him dead.

1490
01:26:24,387 --> 01:26:27,015
And I'm the one that
fixed it so he was dead.

1491
01:26:27,098 --> 01:26:30,811
Is that what you're telling
me? And nobody's pulling out.

1492
01:26:30,977 --> 01:26:33,522
We went into this together, we're
coming out at the end together.

1493
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:37,359
It's straight down the line
for both of us, remember?

1494
01:26:44,074 --> 01:26:45,701
<i>(Walter)
Yes, I remembered.</i>

1495
01:26:47,077 --> 01:26:50,372
<i>Just like I remembered
what you had told me, Keyes...</i>

1496
01:26:50,414 --> 01:26:52,875
<i>about that trolley car ride...</i>

1497
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:55,378
<i>and how there was no getting
off till the end of the line...</i>

1498
01:26:57,004 --> 01:26:58,881
...where the cemetery was.

1499
01:27:00,341 --> 01:27:03,594
And then I got to thinking
what cemeteries are for.

1500
01:27:04,262 --> 01:27:06,514
They're to put dead people in.

1501
01:27:08,266 --> 01:27:11,895
I guess that was the first time I
ever thought about Phyllis that way.

1502
01:27:11,978 --> 01:27:13,521
Dead, I mean.

1503
01:27:14,689 --> 01:27:17,275
And how it would be
if she were dead.

1504
01:27:18,568 --> 01:27:21,404
<i>I saw Lola three or four times
that week.</i>

1505
01:27:22,072 --> 01:27:25,909
<i>One night we went up into the
hills behind the Hollywood Bowl.</i>

1506
01:27:26,118 --> 01:27:28,912
<i>I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes,
but it was only with her that...</i>

1507
01:27:28,995 --> 01:27:31,415
<i>I could relax
and let go a little.</i>

1508
01:28:01,612 --> 01:28:03,322
Why are you crying?

1509
01:28:05,241 --> 01:28:07,452
Not gonna tell me, huh?

1510
01:28:07,619 --> 01:28:11,539
Of course I will, Walter. I
wouldn't tell anybody else but you.

1511
01:28:12,791 --> 01:28:15,668
It's about Nino.
Zachetti? What about him?

1512
01:28:15,835 --> 01:28:18,713
They killed my father
together. He and Phyllis.

1513
01:28:18,797 --> 01:28:21,258
He helped her do it.
I know he did.

1514
01:28:22,092 --> 01:28:24,052
What makes you say that?

1515
01:28:24,469 --> 01:28:27,764
I've been following him. He's been
to her house, night after night.

1516
01:28:27,806 --> 01:28:30,225
It was Phyllis
and him all along.

1517
01:28:30,517 --> 01:28:34,563
Maybe he was just going with me as a
blind. And the night of the murder...

1518
01:28:34,646 --> 01:28:36,732
You promised me you weren't
gonna talk like this anymore.

1519
01:28:36,815 --> 01:28:40,319
He was supposed to pick me up
after a lecture at UCLA.

1520
01:28:40,402 --> 01:28:43,322
But he never showed up.
He said he was sick.

1521
01:28:44,114 --> 01:28:45,199
Sick!

1522
01:28:45,282 --> 01:28:46,659
[Sobbing]

1523
01:28:47,284 --> 01:28:51,664
He couldn't show up, because the
train was leaving with my father on it.

1524
01:28:57,295 --> 01:29:00,590
Maybe I'm just crazy.
Maybe it's all in my mind.

1525
01:29:01,632 --> 01:29:03,634
Sure, it's all in your mind.

1526
01:29:03,718 --> 01:29:07,847
I only wish it were, Walter,
'cause I still love him.

1527
01:29:14,187 --> 01:29:17,607
<i>(Walter) Zachetti. Phyllis and Zachetti.</i>

1528
01:29:19,317 --> 01:29:23,363
<i>What was he doing up at her house?
I couldn't figure that one out.</i>

1529
01:29:25,032 --> 01:29:28,118
<i>I tried to make sense
out of it and got nowhere.</i>

1530
01:29:28,619 --> 01:29:31,622
<i>But the real braintwister
came the next day.</i>

1531
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:36,168
<i>You sprang it on me, Keyes, after
office hours, when you caught me...</i>

1532
01:29:36,251 --> 01:29:38,170
<i>down in the lobby
of the building.</i>

1533
01:29:38,212 --> 01:29:40,464
Walter. Walter, just a minute.

1534
01:29:45,094 --> 01:29:48,139
Hello, Keyes. Just hang
on to your hat, Walter.

1535
01:29:48,222 --> 01:29:50,182
What for?
Oh, nothing much.

1536
01:29:50,433 --> 01:29:53,311
That Dietrichson case
just busted wide open.

1537
01:29:53,603 --> 01:29:56,606
How do you mean?
The guy showed. That's how.

1538
01:29:57,815 --> 01:30:00,068
What guy?
The guy who helped her do it.

1539
01:30:00,109 --> 01:30:01,819
The somebody else?

1540
01:30:02,737 --> 01:30:05,406
No kidding? Yeah. She
just filed suit against us.

1541
01:30:05,490 --> 01:30:06,783
It's okay by me.

1542
01:30:06,866 --> 01:30:09,911
When we get them in that courtroom,
I'll tear them to pieces, both of them.

1543
01:30:09,994 --> 01:30:12,247
Come on. I'll buy you a martini,
Walter. No thanks, Keyes.

1544
01:30:12,288 --> 01:30:13,289
With two olives.

1545
01:30:13,373 --> 01:30:15,667
No, I've got to get a shave and
a shoeshine. I've got a date.

1546
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:18,837
Margie. I still bet she drinks
from the bottle.

1547
01:30:19,463 --> 01:30:21,173
They give you matches
when you buy cigars, you know.

1548
01:30:21,256 --> 01:30:22,549
All you have to do is
ask for them.

1549
01:30:22,632 --> 01:30:26,762
Don't like them, they always explode
in my pocket. So long, Walter.

1550
01:30:31,099 --> 01:30:33,102
<i>(Walter)
I was scared stiff, Keyes.</i>

1551
01:30:33,435 --> 01:30:36,271
<i>Maybe you were playing
cat-and-mouse with me.</i>

1552
01:30:36,313 --> 01:30:39,483
<i>Maybe you knew all along
I was the somebody else.</i>

1553
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:44,113
<i>I had to find out, and I knew
where to look. In your office.</i>

1554
01:31:16,688 --> 01:31:18,148
<i>(Keyes on dictation machine)
Memo to Mr. Norton.</i>

01:31:18,231 --> 01:31:19,900
<i>Confidential.
Dietrichson file.</i>

1556
01:31:20,692 --> 01:31:23,487
<i>With regard to your proposal to put
Walter Neff under surveillance...</i>

1557
01:31:23,528 --> 01:31:25,238
<i>I disagree absolutely.</i>

1558
01:31:25,322 --> 01:31:27,658
<i>I have investigated his movements
on the night of the crime...</i>

1559
01:31:27,741 --> 01:31:31,578
<i>and he's definitely placed in
his apartment from 7:15 p. m. On.</i>

1560
01:31:32,162 --> 01:31:35,624
<i>In addition to this, I have known
Neff intimately for 11 years...</i>

1561
01:31:35,708 --> 01:31:39,003
<i>and I personally vouch for him
without reservation.</i>

1562

1563
01:31:43,632 --> 01:31:44,633
[Buzzing stops]

1564
01:31:44,717 --> 01:31:47,637
<i>Furthermore, no connection
whatsoever has been established...</i>

1565
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:50,056
<i>between Walter Neff and
Mrs. Phyllis Dietrichson...</i>

1566

<i>on the nights of July 9th,
10th, 11th, 12th and 13th.</i>

they cannot be accounted for.</i>

1576

report for your consideration.</i>

1577

sufficient evidence against Zachetti...</i>

1578

1579

Phyllis? It's Walter.
I've got to see you. Tonight.

1585
01:33:21,233 --> 01:33:23,235
Yes, it has to be tonight.

1586
01:33:23,861 --> 01:33:25,279
How's 11:00?

1587
01:33:26,447 --> 01:33:28,240
Don't worry about Keyes.

1588
01:33:28,282 --> 01:33:31,285
Just leave the front door
unlocked and put the lights out.

1589
01:33:31,327 --> 01:33:34,288
No, nobody's watching
the house. Not anymore.

1590
01:33:34,830 --> 01:33:38,834
It's just for the neighbors. I
told you not to worry about Keyes.

1591
01:33:39,919 --> 01:33:42,797
I'll see you at 11:00. Yeah.

1592
01:33:44,632 --> 01:33:46,092
Goodbye, baby.

01:33:50,054 --> 01:33:51,806
<i>(Walter) I guess I
don't have to tell you...</i>

1594

at 11:00, Keyes.</i>

all at the same time.</i>

1597
01:34:01,399 --> 01:34:03,526
<i>Yeah, that's what I thought.</i>

1598
01:34:04,152 --> 01:34:07,530

1603
01:35:23,484 --> 01:35:24,902
Hello, baby.

1604
01:35:27,112 --> 01:35:29,823
Anybody else in the house?
Nobody. Why?

1605
01:35:31,367 --> 01:35:34,245
What's that music?
A radio up the street.

1606
01:35:42,753 --> 01:35:45,715
Just like the first time
I came here, isn't it?

1607
01:35:45,756 --> 01:35:48,593
We were talking about
automobile insurance.

1608
01:35:48,968 --> 01:35:51,512
Only you were thinking
about murder.

1609
01:35:52,597 --> 01:35:54,474
I was thinking about
that anklet.

1610
01:35:54,557 --> 01:35:56,434
And what are you
thinking about now?

1611
01:35:56,476 --> 01:35:58,770
I'm all through thinking,
baby.

1612
01:35:58,978 --> 01:36:01,272
I just came to say goodbye.
Goodbye?

1613
01:36:01,481 --> 01:36:05,485
Where are you going? You're the
one that's going, baby. Not me.

1614
01:36:05,777 --> 01:36:08,363
I'm getting off the trolley
car right at this corner.

1615
01:36:08,447 --> 01:36:10,907
Suppose you stop being fancy.
Let's have it, whatever it is.

1616
01:36:10,991 --> 01:36:14,453
All right, I'll tell you. A friend
of mine's got a funny theory.

1617
01:36:14,828 --> 01:36:17,789
He says when two people commit a murder,
it's sort of like they're riding...

1618
01:36:17,873 --> 01:36:20,501
on a trolley car together. One
can't get off without the other.

1619
01:36:20,584 --> 01:36:22,878
They're stuck with each other
and they have to go on...

1620
01:36:22,961 --> 01:36:25,255
riding together
clear to the end of the line.

1621
01:36:25,297 --> 01:36:27,633
And the last stop
is the cemetery.

1622
01:36:27,675 --> 01:36:30,845
Maybe he's got something
there. You bet he has.

1623
01:36:30,970 --> 01:36:33,681
Two people are gonna ride to
the end of the line, all right.

1624
01:36:33,764 --> 01:36:38,185
Only I'm not gonna be one of them. I've
got another guy to finish my ride for me.

1625
01:36:38,269 --> 01:36:41,731
Just who are you talking
about? An acquaintance of yours.

1626
01:36:41,814 --> 01:36:43,149
A Mr. Zachetti.

1627
01:36:43,191 --> 01:36:44,984
Come on, baby,
I just got into this thing...

1628
01:36:45,068 --> 01:36:47,695
because I happen to know a little
something about insurance, didn't I?

1629
01:36:47,779 --> 01:36:48,780
I was a sucker.

1630
01:36:48,863 --> 01:36:51,658
I'd have been brushed off just as soon
as you got your hands on the money.

1631
01:36:51,699 --> 01:36:54,369
Nobody wanted to brush you
off. Save it. I'm telling this.

1632
01:36:54,828 --> 01:36:56,871
It's been you and that Zachetti
guy all along, hasn't it?

1633
01:36:56,955 --> 01:36:58,540
That's not true.

1634
01:36:58,623 --> 01:37:01,751
Doesn't make any difference
if it's true or not.

1635
01:37:03,003 --> 01:37:06,506
The point is, Keyes believes Zachetti
is the one he's been looking for.

1636
01:37:06,590 --> 01:37:09,634
He'll have him in that gas chamber
before he knows what's happened to him.

1637
01:37:09,718 --> 01:37:13,096
What's happening to me all
this time? Don't be silly, baby.

1638
01:37:18,352 --> 01:37:22,523
What do you think is gonna happen to you?
You helped him do the murder, didn't you?

1639
01:37:22,606 --> 01:37:23,899
That's what Keyes thinks.

1640
01:37:23,983 --> 01:37:26,235
And what's good enough for
Keyes is good enough for me.

1641
01:37:26,318 --> 01:37:30,656
Maybe it's not good enough for me,
Walter. Maybe I don't go for the idea.

1642
01:37:30,698 --> 01:37:32,575
Maybe I'd rather talk.

1643
01:37:32,700 --> 01:37:37,204
Sometimes people are where they can't
talk. Under six feet of dirt, maybe.

1644
01:37:37,538 --> 01:37:41,584
And if it was you, they'd charge that
up to Zachetti, too, wouldn't they?

1645
01:37:41,667 --> 01:37:45,380
Sure they would, and that's
just what's gonna happen, baby.

1646
01:37:45,797 --> 01:37:48,299
'Cause he's coming here
tonight, in about 15 minutes.

1647
01:37:48,383 --> 01:37:51,845
With the cops right behind
him. It's all taken care of.

1648
01:37:52,929 --> 01:37:55,223
That would make everything
lovely for you, wouldn't it?

1649
01:37:55,265 --> 01:37:59,185
Right. And it's got to be done before
that suit of yours comes to trial...

1650
01:37:59,227 --> 01:38:00,729
and Lola gets a chance
to sound off...

1651
01:38:00,937 --> 01:38:04,024
before they trip you up on the stand, and
you start to go in drag me down with you.

1652
01:38:04,065 --> 01:38:06,401
Maybe I had Zachetti here so they
won't get a chance to trip me up...

1653
01:38:06,485 --> 01:38:07,903
so we can get the money
and be together.

1654
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:11,448
That's cute. Say it again. He came
here first to ask where Lola was.

1655
01:38:11,531 --> 01:38:13,575
I made him come back.
I was working on him.

1656
01:38:13,659 --> 01:38:15,661
He's a crazy sort of guy,
quick-tempered.

1657
01:38:15,744 --> 01:38:17,913
I kept hammering into him that
she was with another man...

1658
01:38:17,996 --> 01:38:22,418
so he'd go into one of his jealous rages,
and then I'd tell him where she was.

1659
01:38:22,459 --> 01:38:25,170
And you know what he would've
done to her, don't you, Walter?

1660
01:38:25,254 --> 01:38:29,300
Yeah, and for once I believe you,
because it's just rotten enough.

1661
01:38:30,176 --> 01:38:31,844
We're both rotten.

1662
01:38:31,927 --> 01:38:33,596
Only you're
a little more rotten.

1663
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:35,765
You got me to take care
of your husband for you...

1664
01:38:35,848 --> 01:38:39,393
and then you got Zachetti to take care
of Lola, maybe take care of me, too.

1665
01:38:39,435 --> 01:38:42,522
Then somebody else would have come
along to take care of Zachetti for you.

1666
01:38:42,605 --> 01:38:45,274
That's the way you operate,
isn't it, baby? Suppose it is.

1667
01:38:45,358 --> 01:38:48,653
Is what you've got cooked up
for tonight any better?

1668
01:38:49,487 --> 01:38:53,199
I don't like that music anymore.
Mind if I close the window?

1669
01:39:08,966 --> 01:39:10,300
[Gun fires]

1670
01:39:13,470 --> 01:39:16,432
You can do better than that,
can't you, baby?

1671
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:18,434
Better try it again.

1672
01:39:21,186 --> 01:39:23,522
Maybe if I came
a little closer?

1673
01:39:34,033 --> 01:39:36,536
How's this?
Think you can do it now?

1674
01:39:45,545 --> 01:39:47,964
Why didn't you
shoot again, baby?

1675
01:39:53,678 --> 01:39:57,641
Don't tell me it's because you've
been in love with me all this time.

1676
01:39:57,682 --> 01:40:01,144
No, I never loved you, Walter,
not you or anybody else.

1677
01:40:01,394 --> 01:40:04,648
I'm rotten to the heart.
I used you, just as you said.

1678
01:40:04,690 --> 01:40:07,150
That's all you
ever meant to me...

1679
01:40:08,318 --> 01:40:10,028
until a minute ago...

1680
01:40:11,196 --> 01:40:13,824
when I couldn't fire
that second shot.

1681
01:40:15,409 --> 01:40:18,162
I never thought
that could happen to me.

1682
01:40:19,163 --> 01:40:21,707
Sorry, baby. I'm not buying.
I'm not asking you to buy.

1683
01:40:21,790 --> 01:40:23,542
Just hold me close.

1684
01:40:29,966 --> 01:40:31,467
Goodbye, baby.

1685
01:40:31,634 --> 01:40:33,386
[Gun fires twice]

1686
01:41:26,107 --> 01:41:27,358
Zachetti.

1687
01:41:29,527 --> 01:41:30,862
Come here.

1688
01:41:36,743 --> 01:41:38,411
I said, come here.

1689
01:41:41,122 --> 01:41:44,167
My name is Neff. Yeah,
and I still don't like it.

1690
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:45,877
What do you want?

1691
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:47,253
Look, kid.

1692
01:41:48,421 --> 01:41:51,675
I want to give you a present.
This nice new nickel.

1693
01:41:51,841 --> 01:41:53,927
What's the gag? Suppose you
go on back down the hill...

1694
01:41:53,969 --> 01:41:55,595
to the drugstore
and make a phone call.

1695
01:41:55,637 --> 01:41:57,764
Keep your nickel and buy
yourself an ice-cream cone.

1696
01:41:57,806 --> 01:41:59,599
The number is Granite-0-3-8-6.

1697
01:41:59,641 --> 01:42:02,227
Ask for Miss Dietrichson.
First name is Lola.

1698
01:42:02,311 --> 01:42:03,395
She isn't worth a nickel.

1699
01:42:03,478 --> 01:42:05,939
If I ever talk to her, it's not
going to be over any telephone.

1700
01:42:06,023 --> 01:42:07,065
Tough, aren't you?

1701
01:42:07,149 --> 01:42:09,151
Here, take the nickel and
call her. She wants you to.

1702
01:42:09,234 --> 01:42:10,986
She doesn't want
any part of me.

1703
01:42:11,278 --> 01:42:13,822
I know who told you that.
It's not true.

1704
01:42:13,906 --> 01:42:16,450
Lola's in love with you.
She always has been.

1705
01:42:16,492 --> 01:42:18,744
Don't ask me why.
I couldn't even guess.

1706
01:42:18,828 --> 01:42:22,081
Here. Granite-0-3-8-6.
Now go on and call her.

1707
01:42:22,748 --> 01:42:24,333
Go on. That way.

1708
01:42:34,594 --> 01:42:36,763
(Walter)
It's almost 4:30 now, Keyes.

1709
01:42:38,139 --> 01:42:39,182
It's cold.

1710
01:42:41,267 --> 01:42:44,854
I wonder if she's still lying
alone up there in that house...

1711
01:42:44,938 --> 01:42:47,065
or if they've found her
by now.

1712
01:42:48,733 --> 01:42:52,028
I wonder a lot of things.
They don't matter anymore.

1713
01:42:53,029 --> 01:42:54,531
[Coughing]

1714
01:42:56,324 --> 01:42:59,328
Except I want you to do
a favor for me, Keyes.

1715
01:43:00,203 --> 01:43:05,125
I want you to be the one to tell Lola,
kind of gently, before it breaks wide open.

1716
01:43:06,794 --> 01:43:10,506
And I want you to take care
of her and that guy Zachetti...

1717
01:43:15,094 --> 01:43:17,888
so he doesn't get
pushed around too much.

1718
01:43:19,890 --> 01:43:21,350
Hello, Keyes.

1719
01:43:31,277 --> 01:43:33,404
Up pretty early, aren't you?

1720
01:43:34,864 --> 01:43:38,201
I always wondered what time
you got down to the office.

1721
01:43:38,910 --> 01:43:42,080
Or did that little man of
yours pull you out of bed?

1722
01:43:42,163 --> 01:43:43,748
The janitor did.

1723
01:43:44,582 --> 01:43:47,210
Seems you leaked a little
blood on the way in here.

1724
01:43:47,294 --> 01:43:48,378
Yeah.

1725
01:43:48,878 --> 01:43:50,755
Wouldn't be surprised.

1726
01:43:52,174 --> 01:43:55,719
I wanted to straighten you out
on that Dietrichson case.

1727
01:43:56,094 --> 01:43:57,512
So I gather.

1728
01:43:59,181 --> 01:44:02,559
How long have you been
standing there? Long enough.

1729
01:44:02,601 --> 01:44:05,604
Kind of a crazy story
with a crazy twist to it.

1730
01:44:06,522 --> 01:44:08,524
One you didn't
quite figure out.

1731
01:44:08,607 --> 01:44:11,026
You can't figure them all,
Walter.

1732
01:44:11,652 --> 01:44:14,405
That's right.
I guess you can't at that.

1733
01:44:15,656 --> 01:44:18,242
Now I suppose
I get the big speech...

1734
01:44:19,285 --> 01:44:22,246
the one with all the
two-dollar words in it.

1735
01:44:23,456 --> 01:44:25,249
Let's have it, Keyes.

1736
01:44:26,626 --> 01:44:29,796
Walter, you're all washed up.

1737
01:44:32,423 --> 01:44:34,926
Thanks, Keyes.
That was short anyway.

1738
01:44:36,302 --> 01:44:38,429
I'm gonna call for a doctor.

1739
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:43,268
What for?
So they can patch me up?

1740
01:44:44,311 --> 01:44:46,980
So they can nurse me along
till I get back on my feet?

1741
01:44:47,063 --> 01:44:50,484
So I can walk into that gas chamber
up at San Quentin on my own power?

1742
01:44:50,525 --> 01:44:52,110
Is that it, Keyes?

1743
01:44:52,194 --> 01:44:53,862
Something like that.

1744
01:44:54,821 --> 01:44:57,157
I've got a different idea.
Yeah?

1745
01:44:57,199 --> 01:44:58,575
Look, Keyes.

1746
01:44:58,951 --> 01:45:01,328
Suppose you went back to bed and
didn't find these cylinders...

1747
01:45:01,411 --> 01:45:03,789
till tomorrow morning,
when the office opens...

1748
01:45:03,831 --> 01:45:06,458
After that you can
play it any way you like.

1749
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:09,128
Would you do
that much for me, Keyes?

1750
01:45:09,378 --> 01:45:13,340
Give me one good reason. I need
four hours to get where I'm going.

1751
01:45:13,382 --> 01:45:16,594
You're not going anywhere,
Walter. You bet I am.

1752
01:45:17,511 --> 01:45:20,389
I'm going across the border.
You haven't got a chance, Walter.

1753
01:45:20,473 --> 01:45:22,016
Good enough to try for.

1754
01:45:22,099 --> 01:45:25,520
You'll never make the border.
That's what you think.

1755
01:45:26,229 --> 01:45:27,730
Just watch me.

1756
01:45:28,189 --> 01:45:30,316
You'll never even make
the elevator.

1757
01:45:30,566 --> 01:45:31,567
So long, Keyes.

1758
01:45:53,715 --> 01:45:55,384
[Phone dialing]

1759
01:46:01,223 --> 01:46:02,516
(Keyes)
Hello...

1760
01:46:02,558 --> 01:46:05,185
send an ambulance to the
Pacific Building on Olive Street.

1761
01:46:07,396 --> 01:46:09,398
Yeah. It's a police job.

1762
01:46:29,210 --> 01:46:31,754
How you doing, Walter?
Fine.

1763
01:46:34,007 --> 01:46:37,552
Only somebody moved the
elevator a couple of miles away.

1764
01:46:38,094 --> 01:46:39,846
They're on the way.

1765
01:46:44,184 --> 01:46:46,812
You know why you couldn't
figure this one, Keyes?

1766
01:46:46,895 --> 01:46:48,396
I'll tell you.

1767
01:46:48,939 --> 01:46:52,192
Because the guy you were
looking for was too close.

1768
01:46:52,275 --> 01:46:54,903
He was right across
the desk from you.

1769
01:46:55,112 --> 01:46:57,072
Closer than that, Walter.

1770
01:46:57,990 --> 01:46:59,366
[Panting]

1771
01:47:01,243 --> 01:47:02,745
I love you, too.
