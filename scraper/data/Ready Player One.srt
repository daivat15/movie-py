1
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:21,413
Get ready for the feel,
the feel of real. X1.

2
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,254
No pain, no gain.

3
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:46,541
Pizza, guys.

4
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:53,682
Whoo-hoo!

5
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,595
Hello, Wade.

6
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,326
Hello, Mrs. Gilmore.

7
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,231
What's the matter?
Life getting you down?

8
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,435
I was born in 2027.

9
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:25,251
After the Corn Syrup Droughts,
after the Bandwidth Riots.

10
00:02:25,252 --> 00:02:27,445
After people stopped trying
to fix problems

11
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,747
and just tried
to outlive them.

12
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,541
My parents,
they didn't make it through those times,

13
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:42,761
so I live here in Columbus,
Ohio, with my Aunt Alice.

14
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:47,101
In 2045, Columbus is the
fastest-growing city on Earth.

15
00:02:47,102 --> 00:02:51,441
It's where Halliday and Morrow
started Gregarious Games.

16
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,709
These days,
reality is a bummer.

17
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,681
Everyone is looking
for a way to escape,

18
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:02,214
and that's why Halliday...

19
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:05,045
That's why he was
such a hero to us.

20
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:08,621
He showed us that we could go somewhere
without going anywhere at all.

21
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,324
You don't need a destination

22
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,055
when you're running on
an omnidirectional treadmill

23
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,400
with quadraphonic,
pressure-sensitive underlay.

24
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,730
James Halliday saw the future.

25
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:21,684
And then he built it.

26
00:03:21,685 --> 00:03:23,637
He gave us a place to go.

27
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:25,966
A place called

28
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,412
the OASIS.

29
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,920
This is the OASIS.

30
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:47,092
It's a place where the limits of
reality are your own imagination.

31
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,636
You can do anything...

32
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,680
...go anywhere.

33
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,906
Like the vacation planet.

34
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,724
Surf a 50-foot monster wave
in Hawaii.

35
00:04:10,725 --> 00:04:13,617
You can ski
down the pyramids.

36
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,520
You can climb Mount Everest

37
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,021
with Batman.

38
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:23,356
Check out this place.
It's a casino the size of a planet.

39
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,030
You can lose your money there.

40
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,431
You can get married.
You can get divorced.

41
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:31,270
You can...
You can go in there.

42
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,371
People come to the OASIS for
all the things they can do,

43
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:37,544
but they stay because of
all the things they can be.

44
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:42,544
Tall, beautiful, scary,
a different sex,

45
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:46,045
a different species,
live-action, cartoon.

46
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,654
It's all your call.

47
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,985
Yeah, that's me.
Well, that's my avatar.

48
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:55,961
At least, until I feel
like changing it.

49
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,214
Except for eating, sleeping,
and bathroom breaks,

50
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:02,467
whatever people wanna do,
they do it in the OASIS.

51
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,468
And since everyone is here,
this is where we meet each other.

52
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,811
It's where we make friends.

53
00:05:06,812 --> 00:05:09,136
Locate Aech.

54
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,482
Locating Aech.

55
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,348
Aech located.

56
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,649
Sector 12. Planet Doom.

57
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,992
Planet Doom,
the most dangerous place in the OASIS,

58
00:05:22,993 --> 00:05:26,089
and a pretty great place
to pick up coin.

59
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,692
Figures Aech would be there.

60
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:33,766
Aech is my best friend
in the OASIS.

61
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,435
He's my best friend, period.

62
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:39,336
Even though I've never actually
met him in the real world.

63
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,506
- WADWhat's up, Aech?
- Hey, what up, Z?

64
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,951
Next race is in 20 minutes,
and I can't do the late one.

65
00:05:47,952 --> 00:05:49,647
What the hell are you up to?

66
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:52,289
Man, gettin' my kills on, bro.

67
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,515
Is that Daito?

68
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,119
Daito and Sho.

69
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,410
This an artifact hunt?

70
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:05,295
Yup. Gregarious 120.

71
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:09,868
Turn into any giant robot
for two minutes. That's rad.

72
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,239
Artifacts.

73
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,840
Those were key.

74
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,011
Halliday made sure
the OASIS was littered

75
00:06:17,012 --> 00:06:19,709
with enough
randomly powerful stuff

76
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:24,082
that anyone could win
if they had the skills.

77
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,923
Death matches and artifact hunts
are a good way to coin-snatch,

78
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:29,689
but depending on your level of armor,
they're risky.

79
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,530
You see,
everyone starts the same,

80
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:34,986
but the more coin you make...

81
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:37,162
- Mom! Mom!
- ...the more you level up.

82
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,073
If you get killed,
your avatar can come back to life...

83
00:06:39,074 --> 00:06:40,365
Go get your dad!

84
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:41,896
...but you lose
all your stuff.

85
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,666
Everything you've
ever worked for.

86
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,009
All your money.

87
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,582
Your clothes.

88
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,180
Your weapons.

89
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,781
Since people spend most of
their time in the OASIS...

90
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,460
...losing your shit means...

91
00:07:02,461 --> 00:07:05,085
Well, losing your shit.

92
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,900
Aech, 10 minutes
until the race starts.

93
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:12,096
AECOkay, Mom, I heard you.

94
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:16,234
You see, the OASIS was the
brainchild of James Halliday.

95
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:21,135
He and his partner, Ogden Morrow,
released the first OASIS build in 2025.

96
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,410
It was an instant success,
and it made them both very rich.

97
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:29,051
But Morrow was out of the picture
after a few years. And Halliday?

98
00:07:29,052 --> 00:07:32,388
He wasn't just the owner of
the world's biggest company.

99
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:36,315
He was like a god.
People loved him.

100
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,492
They worshiped him
as much as his creation.

101
00:07:38,493 --> 00:07:41,331
Maybe we should stop
talking about it

102
00:07:41,332 --> 00:07:43,827
and start, uh, showing it.

103
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,130
If you all wanna reach
under your seats,

104
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,467
you'll find that
there's nothing there.

105
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,668
But we're gonna... we're each
gonna bring you one now.

106
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:56,812
And then,
on January 7, 2040...

107
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,705
He died.

108
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:04,923
And what he left behind

109
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,885
changed everything.

110
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:25,604
Hello. I am James Halliday.

111
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:29,035
If you're watching this,
I'm dead.

112
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:36,281
Before I died, I created what we
in the biz call an "Easter egg."

113
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:43,192
A hidden object in a game that gives
special powers to whoever discovers it.

114
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,192
The first person
to find the egg

115
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,831
I've hidden somewhere
inside the OASIS

116
00:08:50,832 --> 00:08:54,466
will inherit my stock
in Gregarious Games,

117
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:58,337
currently valued in excess
of half a million do...

118
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:01,337
Uh, half a trillion
dollars' worth,

119
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:07,810
and total control
of the OASIS itself.

120
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:13,523
In the form of my avatar,
Anorak the All-Knowing,

121
00:09:13,524 --> 00:09:17,188
I created three keys.

122
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:20,559
Three hidden challenges
test for worthy traits

123
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,813
revealing three hidden keys
to three magic gates.

124
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:29,067
And those with the skill
to survive these straits

125
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:33,868
will reach the end,
where the prize awaits.

126
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,443
Off you go, keys.

127
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:43,721
The keys aren't just laying
around under a rock somewhere.

128
00:09:43,722 --> 00:09:46,446
I suppose you could say
they're invisible,

129
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:50,192
hidden in a dark room
that's at the center of a maze

130
00:09:50,193 --> 00:09:53,159
that's located somewhere

131
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,528
up here.

132
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:00,629
Let the hunt
for Halliday's Easter egg

133
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,543
begin.

134
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,209
The challenge
is to find three keys,

135
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,810
but in five years,
no one has even gotten one key.

136
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,816
And the big scoreboard?
Still empty.

137
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,747
Some long-forgotten gunter
cracked the first clue

138
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:22,036
and found the first challenge.

139
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:24,321
Then, this portal appeared.

140
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:27,763
But the challenge to win the first
key was a race designed by Halliday

141
00:10:27,764 --> 00:10:30,760
that was so hard,
no one had ever finished it.

142
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:34,273
The only ones still trying are the gunters,
as in "egg hunters,"

143
00:10:34,274 --> 00:10:37,836
like me and Sho and Daito,
and my best friend, Aech.

144
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:41,637
Oh, and of course, the Sixers.

145
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,811
The Sixers work for IOI...

146
00:10:42,812 --> 00:10:44,408
Sixers!

147
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,144
...Innovative
Online Industries.

148
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,605
They're the second-largest
company in the world

149
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,848
with designs
on becoming the first.

150
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,819
Which is why they're putting
everything they got

151
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,147
into winning
Halliday's contest.

152
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,852
Buckle up!

153
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,856
Sit in!

154
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,527
We call 'em "Sixers"
'cause that's the company rule.

155
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:03,795
No name, just numbers.

156
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,626
They have a support team
made up of Halliday scholars.

157
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:09,342
Like me, they spend all their
time studying pop culture

158
00:11:09,343 --> 00:11:10,995
that Halliday
was obsessed with,

159
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,013
trying to find clues
to solve the contest.

160
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,538
They're just following
the orders of the head of IOI,

161
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:21,684
this dickweed
named Nolan Sorrento.

162
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,287
How'd you get here before me?

163
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,718
Well, I didn't make a pit stop
at the hair salon.

164
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,234
- What up, Z?
- What's up, Aech?

165
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,526
Saved you a spot.

166
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,898
Thanks, bro.

167
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,634
I gotta go to the back.

168
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,295
Ugh. So you can skim coins
from crashed cars?

169
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:48,073
- That's just sad, man.
- Fuel's low.

170
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:51,884
Oh, but you still had enough to pay
for that Something About Mary hairdo.

171
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,219
First to the key.

172
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,891
First to the egg!

173
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,011
Aech, are you seeing this?

174
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,183
Yeah, I see it.
That's Kaneda's bike from Akira.

175
00:13:33,184 --> 00:13:35,409
It's a licensed skin
over a standard frame.

176
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,768
No, not the bike.
Forget the bike.

177
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:40,093
The girl,
I think it's Art3mis.

178
00:13:40,094 --> 00:13:42,419
The Art3mis? The Sixer Fixer?

179
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:45,361
I've seen all her walk-throughs,
her Twitch streams.

180
00:13:45,362 --> 00:13:47,327
It's her. It's definitely her.

181
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,540
Go, go, go!
Get there! Come on!

182
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,438
AECYou got it, you got it!

183
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,315
Balls.

184
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,029
She's not gonna make it.

185
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,602
Bail! Bail out!

186
00:16:05,603 --> 00:16:06,667
Bail!

187
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,505
Ow!

188
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,537
Damn, I loved that bike.

189
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,206
Oh, Aech could...

190
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,507
Well, he's my friend,
but he could fix it for you.

191
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,620
This is my workshop.
Touch nothing.

192
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,289
Where did you find
an Iron Giant?

193
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:12,213
- Find it? I'm building it.
- That's a commission.

194
00:17:12,214 --> 00:17:15,093
Oh, yeah.
Aech is top-rated on the mod boards.

195
00:17:15,094 --> 00:17:17,974
People all over the OASIS
pay him serious coin.

196
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:20,340
Oh, hey, check this out!

197
00:17:20,341 --> 00:17:23,339
Hey. Z, yo.

198
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,812
- The Galactica, of course.
- These are my babies, all right, man?

199
00:17:25,813 --> 00:17:27,578
Sulaco, from Aliens.

200
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,179
Dude, how are you
showing off my shit?

201
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,752
Valley Forge, from Silent Running.
Oh, where's the Harkonnen Drop-Ship?

202
00:17:31,753 --> 00:17:34,318
That thing is sick.
Folds space like a boss.

203
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,389
I mean, you can get from Incipio
to Arrakis in three seconds...

204
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,156
Fingers!

205
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,587
You'll have to excuse him.

206
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,731
He gets a little nervous
around pretty girls.

207
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,344
I can fix it in 10 minutes.

208
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:55,271
Yup. He's pretty great.

209
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:58,344
I assume you and Shoulder
Blades are clanned up.

210
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:00,611
Oh, Aech? Nah.

211
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:05,582
I mean, he's really good,
but I don't clan.

212
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,286
Oh, 'cause you're Parzival,

213
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,857
as in the knight who found
the Holy Grail by himself.

214
00:18:10,858 --> 00:18:12,856
What about you, Art3mis?

215
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,858
Goddess of the hunt.
Clans must be killing to sign you up.

216
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,397
- Favorite shooter?
- Excuse me?

217
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,368
James Halliday's
favorite first-person shooter.

218
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:22,934
- What?
- Oh. GoldenEye.

219
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,295
- Playing as?
- Oddjob. Is this a test?

220
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,038
Favorite game variant?

221
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,639
Game variant was "slappers only."
No weapons.

222
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,624
I know what "slappers only" means.
Racer?

223
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,609
Turbo. And his favorite food
was Hot Pockets.

224
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,579
Favorite restaurant
was Chuck E Cheese.

225
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,920
Song was Video Killed the
Radio Star by the Buggles.

226
00:18:36,921 --> 00:18:38,815
Video wTake on Me by A-ha.

227
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:43,417
Oh, oh...
His favorite quote was from Superman.

228
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,389
"Some people
can read War and Peace

229
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,590
"and come away thinking it's
a simple adventure story..."

230
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,063
"Others can read the ingredients on
the back of a chewing-gum wrapper

231
00:18:50,064 --> 00:18:53,132
"and unlock the secrets
of the universe."

232
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,572
Lex Luthor.

233
00:18:55,573 --> 00:18:58,236
Cool.

234
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:02,167
What would you do? If you won.
The whole contest, I mean.

235
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:05,276
Oh! I mean,
I've got tons of plans in the real world.

236
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:10,077
I'd... I'd move into a huge mansion,
buy a bunch of cool shit, not be poor.

237
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:14,986
Now I know
why you stopped short.

238
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,157
I stopped because of Kong.
No one ever makes it past Kong.

239
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,424
That... That's...
That's, like, a rule.

240
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:23,755
Well, then you know it can't be true.
Because Halliday hated making rules.

241
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,496
I can't afford to zero out.

242
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,297
- You're afraid to lose your shit.
- No, I'm not!

243
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,869
What happens when IOI
offers you guaranteed coin

244
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,267
for the keys to the kingdom?

245
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,599
Nolan Sorrento
takes over the world.

246
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:36,944
A real gunter would risk everything
to save the OASIS from IOI.

247
00:19:36,945 --> 00:19:38,442
Who said that?

248
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:39,913
Me.

249
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,329
There you go. Good as new.

250
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,546
Thanks for the fix-up, my man.

251
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,328
That's better.

252
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,370
I'll wave to you
from the finish line, McFly.

253
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,004
That went well.

254
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,905
Thanks to you,
Captain Big Mouth.

255
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:12,337
Wade? Wade?
Where the hell are my gloves?

256
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,384
Shit. I gotta go.

257
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,416
ANNOUNCEX1.

258
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:22,388
When I'm after gold on Planet Doom,
I need every edge I can get.

259
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:26,521
Every push, punch, gunshot,
you feel it all.

260
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:30,655
Get ready for the feel,
the feel of real. X1.

261
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:33,002
The X1 is like wearing
a second skin.

262
00:20:33,003 --> 00:20:34,998
A skin that kicks ass.

263
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,612
I zeroed out 'cause
of your broke-ass gloves.

264
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,035
Who told you to use them?

265
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,179
You took hers.

266
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,209
So you lost a death match.

267
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:50,121
Why don't you just respawn and
level up like everyone else?

268
00:20:50,122 --> 00:20:52,275
You don't get it.

269
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,524
I bought all these power-ups for
this challenge, and I lost it all.

270
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:56,389
That artifact
was gonna pay for the house!

271
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,055
Wait.

272
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:02,056
How much of our house money
did you spend on upgrades?

273
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,930
Well, all of it,
but I was gonna win.

274
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,870
That was our ticket
out of here.

275
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,965
You idiot.

276
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,970
No, but I only lost 'cause
of the bad gloves.

277
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,706
Our house! Our goddamn house!

278
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,441
My boys
were in that challenge.

279
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,752
You couldn't have beat them
in a bootsuit, you noob.

280
00:21:19,753 --> 00:21:22,905
Stop! No! No!

281
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,215
Alice, call the police!

282
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,876
No, we are not
calling the cops.

283
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,988
Go to your room, Rick.

284
00:21:27,989 --> 00:21:30,087
Aw, come on, Alice.

285
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:34,088
Why do you put up with this guy?
He's a shitshow.

286
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:38,662
I ought to kick the both of you out.
I swear to G-O-D, Wade Watts,

287
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:41,434
if I catch you
touching my stuff again,

288
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:44,043
not joking... Out.

289
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,244
"Wade Watts."

290
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,005
My dad picked that name

291
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,253
because it sounded
like a superhero's alter ego,

292
00:21:57,254 --> 00:22:00,919
like Peter Parker
or Bruce Banner.

293
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,987
But he died when I was a kid.

294
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,188
My mom, too,
and I ended up here,

295
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,091
living with Aunt Alice

296
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,533
and her endless string
of hard-loving losers.

297
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,200
"Halliday hated making rules."

298
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,871
Why is that line
sticking in my head?

299
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,713
Maybe it's 'cause Art3mis said it,
and she's hot.

300
00:22:24,714 --> 00:22:26,977
Maybe it's because
she called me out,

301
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:30,148
sitting here
in my tiny corner of nowhere,

302
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:32,878
protecting my small slice
of nothing.

303
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,152
Or maybe...

304
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:37,663
Maybe it's because
that line means something

305
00:22:37,664 --> 00:22:39,356
and I missed it.

306
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,109
The day the contest
was announced,

307
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,059
the Halliday Journals
appeared.

308
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:49,403
He told us to look in his brain.
This was the next best thing.

309
00:22:49,404 --> 00:22:52,744
At first, it was jammed with
gunters looking for answers.

310
00:22:52,745 --> 00:22:55,368
Now, the once-crowded halls
of Halliday's memories

311
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,644
are left to people like me.

312
00:22:56,645 --> 00:22:59,410
Parzival. Oh, joy!

313
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:02,911
And how will you eat up
my valuable search time today?

314
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:05,082
Gregarious Games, 2029...
Office party.

315
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:08,253
Office party.
Yes, you've only seen it a thousand times.

316
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:11,021
Why not go back?

317
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:14,732
Each entry into Halliday's
Journals is meticulously assembled

318
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:17,226
from personal photographs,
home video recordings,

319
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,159
surveillance, and nanny cams.

320
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:23,000
All rendered into a three-dimensional
virtual experience.

321
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:26,671
Also, Halliday archived every film,
game, book, and television program

322
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:30,007
he ever saw,
located on the mezzanine.

323
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:33,578
No weapons or mature-themed avatars
are permitted within the Journals.

324
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:37,378
Please enjoy your time with us,
and happy gunting!

325
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:39,216
I like cleaning up.

326
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:41,647
Okay, Jim,
I'm, uh... I'm going.

327
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,527
Everything changes, Jim.
Everything evolves.

328
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:53,247
Some things are perfect just
the way they arAsteroids.

329
00:23:53,248 --> 00:23:56,968
People don't live inside
an Asteroids arcade cabinet.

330
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,137
I know that.

331
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:02,368
Yeah, well,
people are living inside the arcade we built.

332
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,542
- I built.
- Uh, well...

333
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:07,253
Right. Well,
I guess you can say whatever you want.

334
00:24:07,254 --> 00:24:08,775
I don't really wanna
talk about it anymore.

335
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,950
No, of course
you don't wanna talk about it.

336
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:11,378
You're forcing me out.

337
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:12,917
Closer on Halliday.

338
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,788
Look, invention
comes with responsibilities

339
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:16,954
you didn't ask for.

340
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,155
All right,
if you make something people want or need

341
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,957
then it's up to you to set the limits.
You have to make some rules.

342
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,560
"I don't wanna make
any more rules."

343
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,402
I don't wanna make
any more rules.

344
00:24:25,403 --> 00:24:26,827
"I'm a dreamer."

345
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,132
I'm a dreamer.

346
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,068
- I build worlds.
- "I build worlds."

347
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,839
We created something beautiful,
Jim, but it's changed.

348
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,469
Okay? It's really
not a game anymore.

349
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,107
Are we finished?

350
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:41,648
I liked how things were
when they were...

351
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,249
When it was a game.

352
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,020
And we're back to where we started.
But that's the point, isn't it?

353
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:50,519
Things move forward
whether you like it or not.

354
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,662
Yeah, we're finished.

355
00:24:52,663 --> 00:24:54,357
Fine.

356
00:24:56,528 --> 00:25:00,368
Why can't we go backwards,
for once?

357
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,867
Backwards, really fast.
Fast as we can.

358
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,972
Really put the pedal to the metal,
you know?

359
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:11,675
Go back 10 seconds!

360
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:16,306
Why can't we go backwards,
for once?

361
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:20,718
Backwards, really fast.
Fast as we can.

362
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:23,519
Really put the pedal to the metal,
you know?

363
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,323
Bill and Ted did it.

364
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:49,706
Back again so soon?

365
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:53,449
Careful not to lose your shit.

366
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,859
You figured something out.

367
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,088
Parzival, tell me.

368
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,000
Nice racing, Padawan.
You're the first to finish.

369
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:51,538
Mr. Halliday... Anorak.

370
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,804
It's such an honor.

371
00:27:54,805 --> 00:27:56,739
The honor is all mine.

372
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,619
Get yourself a clue.

373
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:27,735
Who is this Parzival,
and how the hell is he winning?

374
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:30,106
Well, here's a better question.
Who cares?

375
00:28:30,107 --> 00:28:32,475
Halliday's contest
is vitally important.

376
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,577
I mean, it's nothing less than a
war for control of the future.

377
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,820
But this Parzival?
He's not even clanned up.

378
00:28:38,821 --> 00:28:42,147
He's alone. We have an army.

379
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:43,893
And yet,
he's got the first key.

380
00:28:43,894 --> 00:28:45,756
Yeah, he has a key,

381
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:48,757
but you have to get three of
'em to win the contest.

382
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,428
Our stock dove 6% yesterday.

383
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:55,399
Loyalty division is reporting
profits of 28%. F'Nale.

384
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,240
We're opening five new
loyalty centers this month.

385
00:28:58,241 --> 00:29:00,266
Debt Services dwarfs Hardware.

386
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:02,341
Now, you really wanna talk
to me about stock prices?

387
00:29:02,342 --> 00:29:04,374
The shareholders
won't be happy.

388
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:07,045
It's not our job to make them happy.
It's our job to make them money,

389
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:11,145
but once we launch this little baby,
they're gonna flip.

390
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,617
We call this Pure O2.

391
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,520
This is the first
of our planned upgrades.

392
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:20,132
Once we can roll back some of
Halliday's ad restrictions,

393
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:24,194
we estimate
we can sell up to 80%

394
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:29,595
of an individual's visual field before
inducing seizures, so picture this...

395
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,671
All of this implies
we win the contest.

396
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:37,743
Indeed, it does.

397
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:42,314
Dude, you won the key
and 100,000 coins?

398
00:29:42,315 --> 00:29:43,814
As soon as I took the key,

399
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,715
all the coins
just appeared in my account.

400
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,047
I'll tell you what,
I'm soiling my haptics right now.

401
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:53,456
What the hell's a Cataclyst?

402
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:57,228
A bomb. Kills every avatar
on a planet, even the owner.

403
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:58,458
Who'd want that?

404
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,533
IOI.
They buy everything.

405
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,643
Twenty-thou
for the holy hand grenade?

406
00:30:04,644 --> 00:30:06,366
That's a steal!

407
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,480
Whoa! Zemeckis Cube!
I need one of those.

408
00:30:12,481 --> 00:30:14,207
Okay, don't spend
all your money.

409
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,186
X1 haptic bootsuit.

410
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,226
Oh, yeah!

411
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,420
i-R0k, old friend.
How are you?

412
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,262
To be honest,
I have kind of a neck thing.

413
00:31:36,263 --> 00:31:38,228
It's like a carpel-tunnel deal

414
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,478
but with your neck,
if that's even a thing.

415
00:31:40,479 --> 00:31:42,728
So if you could just stand
to... to your right.

416
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,004
My right, your left.

417
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:49,240
Thanks, it's the repetitive stress.
Oh.

418
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,435
Here he is.

419
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:57,198
The steampunk pirate king.
I knew him well, Sorrento.

420
00:31:57,199 --> 00:32:00,886
There are only three things
in this world I hate,

421
00:32:00,887 --> 00:32:04,855
steampunk, pirates,
and tabbouleh.

422
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:07,686
I mean,
why do they even have it?

423
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:10,402
Is there a reason
we're meeting here?

424
00:32:10,403 --> 00:32:15,625
Yes, Nolan. The Orb of Osuvox.

425
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:19,003
You wanted it. He had it.
And so here it is.

426
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:26,744
It creates an impenetrable magic
shield that can only be taken down

427
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:29,148
by a magic spell.

428
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:31,048
The Orb of Osuvox.

429
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,949
Don't say that again.

430
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,051
Okay.

431
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,920
Now, I'm gonna need you
to keep this for now.

432
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:42,164
I'm gonna let you know
when I wanna use it.

433
00:32:42,165 --> 00:32:43,230
Okay?

434
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,671
Right now, though,
I have another job for you.

435
00:32:50,672 --> 00:32:51,998
Ah.

436
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,937
Parzival.

437
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:56,908
Let me guess,
you want him off the scoreboard.

438
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,242
Can you do that?

439
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:01,778
Well, he's a superstar.

440
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,647
He made it
through the first gate

441
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,248
and avatars are gonna be
on him like hoes on Santa.

442
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,486
i-R0k, how much more
do you want?

443
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:13,117
That's what I like about you, Nolan.
You never lick.

444
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,164
You bite straight
to the chocolaty center

445
00:33:15,165 --> 00:33:17,294
of the Tootsie Pop.

446
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:19,695
Remember that old commercial,
with the owl?

447
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:20,767
i-R0k.

448
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,500
Three times my normal fee.

449
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,136
Done.

450
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,007
Wait, really?
I should have asked for five.

451
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:30,006
Is four still on the table?

452
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,210
There's five of us
on the big board now.

453
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:38,015
Art3mis was next,
no surprise there.

454
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,346
She was on the track when I won.
She saw me going backwards.

455
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:46,392
I gave Aech a tip, made him promise not
to say anything, and then he won next.

456
00:33:46,393 --> 00:33:49,061
I'm pretty sure
he bragged to our pal Daito,

457
00:33:49,062 --> 00:33:51,795
'cause he won right after.

458
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:55,396
And of course,
Daito told his best friend, Sho...

459
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,547
He totally totaled his car,

460
00:33:57,548 --> 00:33:59,695
but then Sho got it, too.

461
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,914
"A creator who hates
his own creation.

462
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:15,415
"A hidden key, a leap not taken.
Retrace your steps, escape your past."

463
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,155
"A creator who hates
his own creation.

464
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:22,586
"A hidden key, a leap not taken.
Retrace your steps, escape your past.

465
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:25,063
"And the key of jade
will be yours at last."

466
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,874
"Escape your past."

467
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:15,513
What part of your past are you
trying to escape, Halliday?

468
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:29,085
- Hey, it's Parzival!
- Dude!

469
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,101
You're, like,
totally my hero!

470
00:35:32,102 --> 00:35:33,256
Hey, Parzival!
Over here!

471
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:35,398
Dude, you're amazing!

472
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,469
Hey, Parzival! Right here!
Let me get an autograph!

473
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,308
Watch it!

474
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:49,449
You're famous now!
You can't just go wherever you want!

475
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,847
No, no, no, I...

476
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,656
Huh?

477
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:03,525
Ahh!

478
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,800
That is... That is not funny.

479
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:16,458
Oh, God.

480
00:36:16,459 --> 00:36:19,109
Ugh.

481
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,744
Oh, God. Don't you get it?

482
00:36:21,745 --> 00:36:24,379
You're "the Parzival" now.

483
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:25,882
You have to have a disguise.

484
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:29,792
Okay, here.

485
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,722
Clark Kent glasses.

486
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:35,033
They hide your identity
without changing your look.

487
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,344
I'm not wearing that.

488
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,514
This is great.

489
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,575
The way your inventory
bursts out when you die.

490
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:01,251
They didn't want
any more blood.

491
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:02,892
This is right before
the OASIS went live.

492
00:37:02,893 --> 00:37:06,487
Six days prior.
December 2nd, 2025.

493
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,525
Check this out.

494
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,156
You know who that is?

495
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:13,530
Is that Sorrento?

496
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,498
Sorrento started
as an intern.

497
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:17,934
He claims he learned
at the feet of the master.

498
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:20,665
That's how he convinced IOI
to create the Sixers for him,

499
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:22,605
his Halliday knowledge.

500
00:37:22,606 --> 00:37:24,540
But ask Ogden Morrow?

501
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:28,712
He says the only thing Sorrento
actually knew about Halliday

502
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:30,380
was how he liked his coffee.

503
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:32,881
You could have, like,
different tiers of accounts,

504
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,517
like a gold member.

505
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:38,188
A person could be
silver, platinum, bronze.

506
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,257
You know, depending on
what they paid.

507
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,128
You know, highest one maybe being
"Water" because "OASIS," right?

508
00:37:43,129 --> 00:37:45,057
Hell of a latte.

509
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,132
Can you fast-forward to the
stuff about Halliday's date?

510
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:48,971
What? Halliday actually went
on a date?

511
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,738
So, what happened?

512
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:57,974
Nothing. I invited her over.

513
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:00,605
Well, did you at least
get her name?

514
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:04,321
Yeah. Kira, I told you,
like the character in The Dark Crystal.

515
00:38:04,322 --> 00:38:06,145
That's her gamer tag.

516
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,386
- Karen.
- Karen.

517
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:11,717
Yeah, okay? Karen Underwood.

518
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:15,332
No, no. Karen Underwood,
as in Ogden Morrow's wife?

519
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:17,326
Just watch.

520
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:21,098
So, listen, you and Karen Underwood.
What'd you do?

521
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:23,497
She wanted to go dancing,

522
00:38:23,498 --> 00:38:25,897
so we watched a movie.

523
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,368
And?

524
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,138
Where's the juice?

525
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,344
Give me some juice!

526
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:37,745
- There is no juice!
- Oh, God!

527
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:39,416
Hold the phone.

528
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:43,517
Halliday went on a date
with Ogden Morrow's wife?

529
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:46,961
Just once, years before they
were even married, but yeah.

530
00:38:46,962 --> 00:38:49,326
And despite that,
and the fact that she died,

531
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,627
the name "Kira" is only mentioned
once in all of Halliday's Journals.

532
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,960
That's not possible.

533
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:55,865
It is. Look it up.

534
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:58,296
What we just saw is the only
time she's ever mentioned.

535
00:38:58,302 --> 00:38:59,802
It makes no sense.

536
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:02,174
She was an important part
of both their lives.

537
00:39:02,175 --> 00:39:04,113
I'll bet you anything.
All my coin.

538
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:09,813
Search
"Karen Underwood Morrow."

539
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:12,984
Kira, I told you,
like the character in The Dark Crystal.

540
00:39:12,985 --> 00:39:15,185
That's her gamer tag.

541
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,886
Halliday purposely removed every
mention of her except for this one.

542
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:19,518
That's weird. Why?

543
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,088
It's like, it was just
so painful for him

544
00:39:22,089 --> 00:39:24,655
to have to see her face
or hear her name.

545
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:26,529
Well, he loved her.

546
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,398
He couldn't tell that
to Morrow.

547
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,069
Oh, that's sad.
He should have told her how he felt.

548
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,567
Yeah, well,
he missed his chance.

549
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,699
Look.

550
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,914
I found the clue to the race
in the other scene, but...

551
00:39:36,915 --> 00:39:38,507
I've always felt
that the biggest clue

552
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,379
to the contest
was hidden here.

553
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,148
You're right.

554
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,215
I lose.

555
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,016
Don't sweat it, Curator.

556
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:49,517
You see, Kira is the Rosebud
at the center of his story.

557
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,720
She's the big mystery.

558
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,091
No, no. A bet is a bet.

559
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:57,662
Oh, wow. A quarter.
You can keep it.

560
00:39:57,663 --> 00:39:59,801
No. You can keep it.

561
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,470
- You free Thursday?
- Who, me?

562
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:07,973
No, him.

563
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:11,013
Oh, my God. Yes, you!

564
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:15,047
You know The Distracted Globe?

565
00:40:15,048 --> 00:40:17,145
Yeah, the dance club.

566
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,918
Meet me there. 10:00 p.m.

567
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,189
There's something
I wanna show you.

568
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:26,515
Uh, bye-bye!

569
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,391
Did she just ask me out?

570
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:31,263
And I was starting
to like her.

571
00:40:31,264 --> 00:40:33,096
All right.

572
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,667
I don't do that.

573
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:40,295
Z, I can't believe
you told her about Kira.

574
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:43,543
What? I told you.

575
00:40:43,544 --> 00:40:46,776
Hey, what about this?

576
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,646
No. Have you considered that
Art3mis could be using you?

577
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:54,117
Hey, dude, she's giving me a clue.
Maybe I'm the one using her.

578
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,718
Should I go more Thriller?

579
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,161
No.

580
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:00,990
Punk?

581
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:02,061
No.

582
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:05,464
Duran Duran.

583
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:07,297
No.

584
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,468
Does it look like
I'm trying too hard?

585
00:41:08,469 --> 00:41:11,734
Yes! Listen to yourself!

586
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:14,604
You have a massive cyber crush
on this girl.

587
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:17,475
She's hacking your heart
to get to your head.

588
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,846
I got it!

589
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,009
- Buckaroo Banzai?
- Yeah!

590
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:27,284
Really? You're gonna wear the
outfit from your favorite movie?

591
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:28,988
Don't be that guy.

592
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:30,687
I am that guy.

593
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,458
Z, you gotta be more careful
about who you meet in the OASIS.

594
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:35,756
Aech, Art3mis gets me.
She'll get my outfit.

595
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:38,759
There's just this connection.
I mean, sometimes, we even...

596
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:40,462
- Finish each other's sentences?
- Yeah!

597
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:43,366
We have that. Me and you.

598
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:46,937
Yeah, I know,
but that's because we're best friends, dude.

599
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:48,867
She could be a dude,
too, dude.

600
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:50,326
Come on.

601
00:41:50,327 --> 00:41:51,774
I'm serious!

602
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:54,544
She could actually be
a 300-pound dude

603
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:57,715
who lives in his mama's
basement in suburban Detroit.

604
00:41:57,716 --> 00:41:59,615
And her name is Chuck.

605
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:03,885
Think about that.

606
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:34,484
Whoa, dude,
is that Parzival?

607
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:36,215
- Parzival!
- Oh, my God, Parzival!

608
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,490
Come here, man.
Hey, can we get a photo?

609
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:43,832
- Thank you so much!
- Dude, you're my hero!

610
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:45,157
Hey, Parzival.

611
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,298
Thank you.

612
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,180
Get out of town!
Buckaroo Banzai?

613
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:08,523
- Huh?
- I like it. I liBuckaroo Banzai.

614
00:43:08,524 --> 00:43:10,240
- Oh, thanks!
- It's great!

615
00:43:10,241 --> 00:43:11,957
- Yeah! You look...
- Oh.

616
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:13,456
You look awesome!

617
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:14,657
- Thank you.
- Wow.

618
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:18,263
A big one, a small one?

619
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:19,462
A big one!

620
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:38,314
Get out of here.

621
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:40,245
What a freak!
I thought he was kind of cute.

622
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,867
Have you been here before?

623
00:43:41,868 --> 00:43:43,485
It's cool, right? I mean...

624
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,887
So, what's the plan?

625
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:48,329
Are you gonna kill their avatars?
Zero them out?

626
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:50,455
They're both here
at The Distracted Globe.

627
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,929
I can't talk.

628
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,830
The Distracted Globe
was one of the first clubs

629
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:56,102
Halliday created in the OASIS.

630
00:43:56,103 --> 00:43:57,600
That's common knowledge.

631
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:59,936
But I double-checked

632
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:02,407
and it turns out he started building it
right after that moment you showed me.

633
00:44:02,408 --> 00:44:03,666
The date with Kira.

634
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:05,759
Right, and she was
a serious dancer.

635
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,846
Maybe he thought
he'd take her here,

636
00:44:07,847 --> 00:44:10,675
like on a virtual date.

637
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:12,581
As if that ever works.

638
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,083
So Halliday built it for her?

639
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:15,424
But they never made it
past the first date.

640
00:44:15,425 --> 00:44:16,849
So Halliday's the creator...

641
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:18,187
Who hates his own creation.

642
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:19,588
And the club
is the thing he hates.

643
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,890
And "A hidden key,
a leap not taken"?

644
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:26,755
But people jump off it
all night long.

645
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:28,698
But none of those people
had the Copper Key,

646
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:32,339
so when we jump off,
maybe it's different. Right?

647
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,396
WADRight.

648
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:37,676
So we take it together?

649
00:44:37,677 --> 00:44:38,905
Sure.

650
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,984
We're not clanning up
or anything.

651
00:44:42,985 --> 00:44:46,080
Of course not. I don't clan.

652
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:48,419
Wait...

653
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,688
Whoa!

654
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,761
Ow! Whoa.

655
00:44:57,194 --> 00:45:01,004
I don't think this is it.
No scoreboard, no obstacles.

656
00:45:01,005 --> 00:45:03,698
- Maybe a dance challenge?
- Huh? Whoa!

657
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:21,149
Old-school!

658
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:45,838
You come prepared?

659
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:47,113
"Prepared"?

660
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:53,249
What kind of haptics
you rockin'?

661
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,750
You got the gloves and full visor,
or a full body?

662
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:01,390
Can you feel this?

663
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:06,228
Um, yeah.

664
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:09,100
I got the X1 haptic bootsuit with
the microfiber crotch inlay.

665
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:24,348
My, Parzival,
you did come prepared.

666
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:31,254
So, I've been thinking.

667
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:33,885
Maybe it'd be cool if we
met up in the real world.

668
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:35,994
No, you'd be disappointed.

669
00:46:35,995 --> 00:46:38,159
No, I wouldn't. I like you.

670
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,325
You don't even know me.

671
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,165
This isn't
what I really look like.

672
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:46,166
This isn't my real body,
or my real face.

673
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:47,904
I don't care.

674
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:49,465
I wanna know your real name.

675
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:52,983
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha

676
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:04,216
- My name's Wade.
- What?

677
00:47:05,689 --> 00:47:07,657
- I said my name's...
- Stop!

678
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,526
Well, Buckaroo blows it.
Shocking.

679
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:13,157
Are you crazy?
You don't tell anyone who you are.

680
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,673
You can't use your real name.

681
00:47:14,674 --> 00:47:15,925
You're not just anyone.

682
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:17,633
You don't know me.

683
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:18,974
You don't know anything about me.
We've never met.

684
00:47:18,975 --> 00:47:20,769
I do know you, Arty.

685
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,066
I'm in love with you.

686
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:34,949
- Is this part of the challenge?
- No.

687
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:36,192
It's an ambush.

688
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:46,357
IOI, always in the way.

689
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:48,203
Did you hear what I said?
I said I'm in love with you.

690
00:47:48,204 --> 00:47:49,628
No, you're not.

691
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:52,798
You only know
what I want you to know.

692
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:54,713
You only see
what I want you to see.

693
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:59,444
That's what
you're in love with.

694
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:14,457
Watch out!

695
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:26,138
Pull.

696
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:41,915
Head back! Z!
Your armor is running low.

697
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,119
I just bought this.

698
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:52,428
Zemeckis Cube.

699
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,329
Turns everything
back in time 60 seconds.

700
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:00,972
And you waited
until now to use it?

701
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:11,206
Wow, you were amazing.

702
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:16,548
This isn't a game, Z.

703
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:19,789
I'm doing this to stop IOI.

704
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,290
I'm talking about
real-world consequences.

705
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,892
People suffering.

706
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:27,282
- Actual life-and-death stuff.
- I know. I know...

707
00:49:27,283 --> 00:49:30,672
No, you don't know!
My dad died in a loyalty center.

708
00:49:30,673 --> 00:49:33,836
- He borrowed gear.
- He built up debt.

709
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:37,337
He moved in with the promise of
working it off, but he never did.

710
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:39,241
IOI just raised
his living expenses,

711
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:40,812
then he got sick,
and he couldn't afford to get out.

712
00:49:40,813 --> 00:49:43,311
And then he died!

713
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:44,680
I'm so sorry, I didn't...

714
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:46,781
No, you don't live
in the real world, Z.

715
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:49,853
From what you've told me,
I don't think you ever have.

716
00:49:49,854 --> 00:49:52,690
You live inside this...
This illusion,

717
00:49:52,691 --> 00:49:55,527
and I can't afford
to let you distract me.

718
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:10,468
How the hell
did they get away?

719
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:12,784
Do you want the long version?
Your guys suck.

720
00:50:12,785 --> 00:50:14,476
They failed
to kill his avatar,

721
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:16,708
which, if we're offering
constructive criticism,

722
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:19,548
was a lame idea and only
would've slowed him down.

723
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:23,889
Whereas my plan, which was cool
because I rock, actually worked.

724
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:25,654
He's still on the board.

725
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:29,185
I know that, Nolan.
But he won't be for long.

726
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,160
I did a search
for all the Wades

727
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:33,361
who had recently bought
an X1 bootsuit,

728
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:36,573
cross-referenced that with public records,
and voila,

729
00:50:36,574 --> 00:50:40,636
which is French for...
"And then I found out."

730
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,972
Ready?

731
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:47,283
The real-world identity
of Parzival is Wade Watts.

732
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:49,611
Voila.

733
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:54,148
Are you loyal, Ms. Zandor?

734
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:55,921
You really want me
to answer that?

735
00:50:55,922 --> 00:50:57,486
Well, when you're at war,

736
00:50:57,487 --> 00:51:00,517
you need people
who are loyal to a fault.

737
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:02,391
People you can count on
to get things done.

738
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:05,061
I just get people arrested
for not paying their bills.

739
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:08,002
Yeah, 'cause there are some problems
that require a physical solution,

740
00:51:08,003 --> 00:51:10,568
but there are other times,
particularly at war,

741
00:51:10,569 --> 00:51:12,267
when you need
a different set of rules.

742
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:14,099
- The rules of war.
- Exactly.

743
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:16,714
It's too bad my division doesn't
operate inside the OASIS.

744
00:51:16,715 --> 00:51:19,606
Yeah, but if this war
remains in the OASIS,

745
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:22,009
then you can't do anything.

746
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:24,952
So, this is one of those conversations
that we're not really having.

747
00:51:24,953 --> 00:51:26,718
Well, we've had these kind
of conversations before,

748
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:28,446
and look where you are now.

749
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:30,752
You got a seat on the board,
head of your own division,

750
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:34,424
a division that will cease to exist if
the wrong person wins this contest.

751
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:37,760
F'Nale, a game decides
our fate.

752
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:41,601
The only question is,
how far are we willing to go to win it?

753
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:45,843
Tell me what you need, Nolan.

754
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:05,717
Whoa.

755
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:11,146
Where am I?

756
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:13,464
IOI Plaza.
You're a hologram in the real world.

757
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:15,991
That's a really cool rig.

758
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:20,032
Thank you.
It's a brand-new Habashaw, OIR 9400.

759
00:53:20,033 --> 00:53:22,030
It looks like
a giant hamster ball.

760
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:26,802
You know, if you came to work at IOI,
you'd get one of these.

761
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:28,737
I don't clan up.

762
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:30,968
You'd also get your own
penthouse apartment in Columbus

763
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:33,242
with the
highest-speed connection.

764
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:38,653
In the OASIS, you'd get unlimited weapons,
magic items, ships.

765
00:53:38,654 --> 00:53:40,516
You want the ship
from Defender?

766
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:43,247
You know, the kind that can
just jump into hyperspace?

767
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:45,163
You want
the Millennium Falcon?

768
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,516
You have that?

769
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:50,364
Anything you need
to help you find that egg,

770
00:53:50,365 --> 00:53:51,730
and then there's the salary.

771
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:54,929
Four million a year.

772
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:58,541
And if you do happen to find that Easter egg,
there's a bonus.

773
00:53:58,542 --> 00:54:00,835
Twenty-five million dollars.

774
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:09,779
I can see you're using
emotion-suppressing software right now,

775
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,679
and why wouldn't you?
It's smart, not to show your hand.

776
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:21,861
It is a lot of money.
I could really use it.

777
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:29,196
But I don't think you and I
would have the same plans.

778
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:32,239
Well, I don't know about that.
What, for the OASIS?

779
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,435
I guess if you're not
a John Hughes fan...

780
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:38,274
Of course I am.

781
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,905
Because the first thing
that I would do

782
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:44,363
is convert all the schools
on Ludus to replicas

783
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:47,818
from The Breakfast Club
and Ferris Bueller.

784
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:50,986
No way. That's a great idea.

785
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:53,455
Which school,
Ridgemont or Faber?

786
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:56,556
Fast Times at Ridgemont High,
not John Hughes.

787
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,799
It's a trap.
Faber College from Animal House.

788
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,426
John Hughes didn't direct

789
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:04,431
Fast Times at Ridgemont High
or Animal House.

790
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:07,774
Ferris Bueller and The Breakfast Club,
they went to Shermer High School,

791
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:11,311
which is in Shermer, Illinois.
I know what you think.

792
00:55:11,312 --> 00:55:13,008
You think
I'm a corporate asshole,

793
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:16,409
that I don't appreciate
pop culture, but...

794
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:19,523
Man, that's not true.
You know, when I wanna blow off steam...

795
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:23,486
Drink Tab, plRobotron,
listen to Duran Duran.

796
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:25,086
I crack open a Tab.

797
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:27,488
I put on some Duran Duran.
I play Robotron.

798
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,625
That's why I love the OASIS.

799
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:32,956
'Cause it's just full
of all these things, man,

800
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:34,502
that people love. You know?

801
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:44,805
I'm a businessman. I get it.

802
00:55:44,808 --> 00:55:47,608
But I gotta do my job.

803
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:53,350
But I didn't ask you here just to
help us find the egg, Parzival.

804
00:55:53,351 --> 00:55:57,190
I asked you here
for what comes after.

805
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,055
What would Halliday say?

806
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:03,787
James Halliday is dead.

807
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:09,028
Yeah. He is.

808
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:13,972
All that's left of him is this
contest. And you know what?

809
00:56:13,973 --> 00:56:16,340
It just seems like he
wouldn't want you winning it.

810
00:56:16,341 --> 00:56:18,339
A fanboy knows a hater,

811
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:20,411
and I know you've got a whole
department of oologists in your ear.

812
00:56:20,412 --> 00:56:22,680
So, if you wanna know
what I really think...

813
00:56:22,681 --> 00:56:24,209
I think you're full of shit.

814
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:31,186
Here's my offer.

815
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:32,687
Your board of directors,
you got them in the other ear?

816
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:34,619
Why don't you tell 'em this.

817
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:38,559
If they dump you,
I'll consider it.

818
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,661
I might say something
off the record.

819
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:43,699
I had to make the offer.

820
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,700
The board expected it,
but I was really hoping you'd say no.

821
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:50,113
Because if anyone's gonna win
this competition, it's me.

822
00:56:50,114 --> 00:56:52,174
My avatar gets the egg

823
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:55,545
'cause I'm the only one here with
the balls to run this place.

824
00:56:55,546 --> 00:56:58,045
Wow, you really
switched gears there.

825
00:56:58,047 --> 00:57:01,117
From fairly reasonable
to maniacal overlord.

826
00:57:01,118 --> 00:57:04,117
You should be grateful, Wade.

827
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,560
You won't be around
to endure my maniacal reign.

828
00:57:07,561 --> 00:57:09,357
Yeah, that's right.
I know who you are.

829
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:14,596
Wade Owen Watts,
born August 12, 2027.

830
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:18,597
I also know where you are.
Unit 56K, Columbus stacks.

831
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:21,371
You were last seen entering
your trailer three days ago.

832
00:57:21,372 --> 00:57:22,805
You haven't left since.

833
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:24,136
What are you doing?
You can't...

834
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:25,740
With all that's going on
in the world,

835
00:57:25,742 --> 00:57:27,112
do you really think that
anyone's gonna give a damn

836
00:57:27,113 --> 00:57:28,644
about an explosion

837
00:57:28,645 --> 00:57:31,205
in some ghetto trash
rat warren in Columbus?

838
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:33,454
Sorrento, don't do this.
I'm not even there!

839
00:57:33,455 --> 00:57:35,350
Not for long.

840
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:41,218
Call Alice.

841
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:42,964
Dial Alice.

842
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:11,319
Pick up! Pick up! Alice!

843
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:18,829
This bootsuit's pretty awesome.
Thanks for that.

844
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:20,928
Rick! Rick, the place
is gonna blow!

845
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:22,430
Rick, is that Wade?

846
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:24,632
- Put Alice on!
- Let me talk to him.

847
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:26,644
Don't call here anymore,
you got me?

848
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:30,937
I don't wanna hear your voice
ever again.

849
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:11,212
Contact Aech, Daito,
Sho, and Art3mis.

850
00:59:11,213 --> 00:59:14,515
IOI came for me
in the real world.

851
00:59:14,517 --> 00:59:17,317
They gotta be coming after you,
so wherever you are...

852
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:45,496
Sorry about the blindfold.

853
00:59:45,497 --> 00:59:47,615
My guys are a little paranoid.

854
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,618
Say that again.

855
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:53,020
My guys are a little paranoid.

856
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,590
Art3mis?

857
00:59:57,093 --> 01:00:01,163
My real name is Samantha,
but yeah, I'm Art3mis.

858
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:05,772
Showers are that way,
clean clothes, too.

859
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:13,108
Welcome to the rebellion,
Wade.

860
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:29,758
That's IOI.
So the stacks are over there?

861
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:32,629
We've been living this close
to each other the whole time?

862
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:36,231
Next door,

863
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:40,342
around the world, it's...
it's all the same in the OASIS.

864
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:45,172
For the record,

865
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:46,675
um...

866
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:50,676
I'm not disappointed.

867
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,780
You said I... I would be
disappointed when I met you, but...

868
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:57,019
I'm not.

869
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,860
I've lived with it my whole life.
You don't have to pretend.

870
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:17,170
You have a birthmark, so what?

871
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:19,781
Why would that scare me?

872
01:01:26,983 --> 01:01:29,623
Z, if I hurt you,
I'm... I'm sorry.

873
01:01:29,624 --> 01:01:31,819
No, it's...

874
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:35,121
Wait, did... did you
just call me "Z"?

875
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:37,164
- Oh, my God. Did I?
- I think you did.

876
01:01:37,165 --> 01:01:39,261
Wade, I'm sorry.

877
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:41,358
Yeah, Wade, Z.

878
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:44,674
You can call me whatever you want.
And I'll call you Sam.

879
01:01:44,675 --> 01:01:45,737
No.

880
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:48,303
Uh, Samantha?

881
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:50,574
Okay. Cool.

882
01:01:57,847 --> 01:01:59,617
Wow.

883
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:02,546
It's so much slower here.

884
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:07,256
I mean, the wind,
the people...

885
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:10,962
Everything.

886
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:18,595
We forget what it's like
to be outside.

887
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:19,671
Yeah.

888
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:26,408
- Uh...
- Oh, shit!

889
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,079
- I just figured it out.
- Figured what out?

890
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,507
The second clue.
I know what it means.

891
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:37,922
We've been thinking about it
too literally.

892
01:02:37,923 --> 01:02:39,454
"The leap not taken,"

893
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:41,685
the leap Halliday didn't take,
is with Kira.

894
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:45,531
Yeah, but... I mean,
he blamed her for breaking up him and Morrow.

895
01:02:45,532 --> 01:02:48,458
No. Halliday was madly
in love with her.

896
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:50,904
He had a chance with Kira.
He had a chance to kiss her, but...

897
01:02:50,905 --> 01:02:52,234
He didn't take the leap.

898
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:55,965
Right. So that's where
we go next.

899
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:57,542
The place where the leap
wasn't taken.

900
01:02:57,543 --> 01:02:59,210
Where the date was.

901
01:02:59,211 --> 01:03:01,178
At the movies!

902
01:03:01,179 --> 01:03:03,145
Hey, Curator.

903
01:03:03,146 --> 01:03:05,146
We figured out the second clue.
The challenge is here.

904
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:07,215
Halliday kept track of every
movie he ever watched,

905
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:10,286
the week and the year he watched it,
and how many times.

906
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:15,056
Curator, can we see
November 23 to 27, 2025?

907
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:16,887
That's the week
he went on the date with Kira.

908
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:25,104
Okay, so our options for that
week are The Fly remake.

909
01:03:25,105 --> 01:03:27,235
Great flick,
terrible date movie.

910
01:03:27,236 --> 01:03:30,736
Say Anything...
That would make sense.

911
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:35,180
We gotta remember the clue.
"A creator who hates his own creation."

912
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:41,750
The Shining!

913
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:44,019
It's Halliday's
11th favorite horror film,

914
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:46,420
and it's based on the best-selling
book by Stephen King,

915
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:48,022
who hated the movie!

916
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:49,754
Hey! No side chitchat.

917
01:03:49,755 --> 01:03:51,486
I think we found it.

918
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:57,928
Are you absolutely sure
you want to go here?

919
01:03:57,934 --> 01:03:59,801
Absolutely positive.

920
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:02,642
Let's hope
you have the belly for it.

921
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:46,751
Look.

922
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:50,352
Ticking clock.

923
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:53,163
Okay, so I'm estimating about

924
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:56,224
five minutes to find the key.

925
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:57,855
Yeah, there are so many keys
The Shining, though.

926
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:00,695
Where do we start?

927
01:05:00,696 --> 01:05:04,096
I've never seen The Shining.
Is it really scary?

928
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,553
Uh, I had to watch it
through my fingers.

929
01:05:07,554 --> 01:05:11,007
Okay, so we got the key
from room 237,

930
01:05:11,008 --> 01:05:12,907
the keys to the Snowcat,

931
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,739
or the keys they give Jack
at the beginning of the movie.

932
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,374
Well,
if it's "the leap not taken,"

933
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:18,005
maybe the key
isn't a key at all.

934
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:19,084
I know
where the Snowcat keys are!

935
01:05:19,085 --> 01:05:20,281
I say we split up.

936
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:21,950
We get all the keys

937
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:23,491
and then we meet back
at the Torrances' apartment.

938
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:29,133
Hello, Danny.

939
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:32,093
Come play with us.

940
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:35,364
Little girls, y'all know
how to get out of here?

941
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:41,469
Wait, wait!

942
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:43,610
Wait, where's Aech?

943
01:05:43,611 --> 01:05:44,936
Wait!

944
01:05:45,975 --> 01:05:47,035
Aech!

945
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:48,877
No, no, no, no!

946
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:08,733
Ahh!

947
01:06:13,402 --> 01:06:15,042
Ahh!

948
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:51,373
Oh, uh, hi, naked lady.
I'm sorry.

949
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:53,484
I didn't mean to interrupt,
uh, your bath time.

950
01:06:53,485 --> 01:06:55,536
Uh, I know self-care
can be important.

951
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:58,714
Uh, but can you do me a favor and tell me,
where are all the exits?

952
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:03,852
Huh. Whoa.

953
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,221
Okay, am I being punked?

954
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:08,622
'Cause you're likin' me
a little way too much.

955
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:12,286
All right, you know what?
I'ma go with it.

956
01:07:25,808 --> 01:07:26,908
Ahh!

957
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:05,580
Time's running out.

958
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:07,715
Yo, Z, is Art3mis
pissed at me?

959
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:10,116
Dude, I'm pissed at you.
You've never seen The Shining, have you?

960
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:11,519
You know I hate scary movies!

961
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,803
We got the key.

962
01:08:12,804 --> 01:08:14,088
Sweet! To room 237!

963
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,630
We ain't got no business
goin' to room 237!

964
01:08:16,631 --> 01:08:18,425
We should stay out!

965
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:20,057
Plus, there was this crazy,
naked zombie lady in there.

966
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:21,762
There are no zombies
The Shining.

967
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,734
Well, maybe it's not supposed
to be like the movie.

968
01:08:23,735 --> 01:08:25,432
Kira is the key.
You're the one who said it.

969
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:27,644
Hey, y'all.
I saw a picture of Kira!

970
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:29,766
Huh?

971
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:33,341
Where?

972
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:44,422
It's Kira.
"Escape your past."

973
01:08:44,423 --> 01:08:47,620
"The leap not taken."

974
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:49,633
Halliday's greatest fear
wasn't The Shining

975
01:08:49,634 --> 01:08:52,085
or any book or movie.

976
01:08:52,094 --> 01:08:55,668
His biggest fear
was kissing a girl.

977
01:08:55,669 --> 01:08:59,244
That's the leap
he couldn't take.

978
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,875
The ballroom.

979
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:24,588
Aech, come on.

980
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:30,170
Zombies. Told you.

981
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:32,844
That's her.

982
01:09:33,869 --> 01:09:34,639
That's Kira.

983
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:40,375
None of this
is in The Shining.

984
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:42,646
Z, look. That's the zombie-circle
level in Mayhem Mansion,

985
01:09:42,647 --> 01:09:44,275
one of Halliday's first games.

986
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,120
The whole Shining trivia
is just a diversion.

987
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:48,946
One minute left.

988
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:51,692
How do we get to her?

989
01:09:51,693 --> 01:09:52,857
Take the leap.

990
01:09:52,858 --> 01:09:53,915
Wait!

991
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:56,431
Whoa!

992
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:05,001
Okay, Mr. Dead Guy.
Cool if I lead?

993
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:54,915
Care to dance?

994
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:58,447
Do you know how long I've
been waiting for you to ask?

995
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,860
Well, well, well.

996
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:11,302
So you found my Jade Key.

997
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:15,696
Imagine that.

998
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:22,283
Thank you.

999
01:11:26,982 --> 01:11:29,122
- Kira was a very beautiful...
- Go on.

1000
01:11:58,113 --> 01:12:01,183
One of our oologists saw them
enter the media library.

1001
01:12:01,184 --> 01:12:02,850
She cracked the clue.

1002
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:06,661
Now, we just have to win
The Shining challenge.

1003
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:11,791
Get her off me!
Get her off me!

1004
01:12:21,203 --> 01:12:25,773
Mr. Sorrento, I really think
you need to see this.

1005
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:29,713
Now Parzival's
got the Jade Key.

1006
01:12:40,055 --> 01:12:42,455
He's alive.

1007
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:45,388
I know. I'll get back to you.

1008
01:12:45,394 --> 01:12:47,464
I got what you're looking for.

1009
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:55,603
Freeze. This guy.
The one with the lame tattoo.

1010
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:03,082
Run him through our database,
every IOI drone in Columbus.

1011
01:13:03,083 --> 01:13:04,578
Find him.

1012
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,174
Groceries are here.

1013
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:34,675
All right. Gluten-O's...

1014
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:35,906
"If you know
the answer ultimate,

1015
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:38,179
"divide it
by the number magic,

1016
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:41,020
"and what you need, want, and desire
will be found in the fortress tragic."

1017
01:13:41,021 --> 01:13:43,116
"Tragic," that's gotta be
Halliday referring to himself.

1018
01:13:43,118 --> 01:13:44,218
Why?

1019
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:46,019
Because he was lonely.

1020
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:47,921
He had no one to spend his
life with towards the end.

1021
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:50,024
Yeah, that's true.

1022
01:13:50,025 --> 01:13:51,955
The contest has gotta be somehow
about connecting with someone.

1023
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,528
Anyone.

1024
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:55,029
He wants the person
who cares for the OASIS

1025
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:56,730
to be connected
with the world.

1026
01:13:56,732 --> 01:13:59,272
That's what I think
he's trying to tell us.

1027
01:14:05,207 --> 01:14:06,877
Wade.

1028
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:11,207
You understand Halliday.

1029
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:14,564
You know him
better than anyone.

1030
01:14:14,565 --> 01:14:17,917
It's exactly
why I think you'll win.

1031
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:21,790
Really? You really think
I'm gonna win?

1032
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:27,461
Do not move!

1033
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:34,335
Target identified!

1034
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:36,967
Freeze! Don't move!

1035
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:46,419
- This leads right to the alley.
- You first.

1036
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:48,145
I'm right behind you. Go now!

1037
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:51,285
Come on!

1038
01:14:51,286 --> 01:14:53,786
- Wade, the OASIS needs you.
- What?

1039
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:55,089
- I'm gonna delay them.
- Wait!

1040
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:57,525
No, no, no, wait! No, no, no!

1041
01:14:57,526 --> 01:14:59,756
You'll forgive me
for this, I promise.

1042
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:10,567
Freeze, freeze, freeze!

1043
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:12,610
Don't move!

1044
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:20,546
Samantha Evelyn Cook.

1045
01:15:20,549 --> 01:15:24,219
IOI has purchased and consolidated
all of your outstanding debt,

1046
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:27,488
currently in excess
of 23,000 credits.

1047
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:30,359
You will be remanded to the
nearest IOI loyalty center

1048
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,859
until your debt
is paid in full,

1049
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:34,660
including any interest,
processing,

1050
01:15:34,663 --> 01:15:37,331
or late fees
you incur henceforth.

1051
01:15:37,332 --> 01:15:39,572
Does anybody have eyes?
Check down the next street!

1052
01:15:52,347 --> 01:15:54,547
- "First to the key."
- "First to the egg."

1053
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,850
Wait, what?

1054
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:59,856
"Never trust someone you meet
in the OASIS."

1055
01:15:59,857 --> 01:16:02,857
"She might be a 300-pound dude
named Chuck..."

1056
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:06,128
"Who lives in his mama's
basement in suburban Detroit."

1057
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:10,364
Aech!

1058
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:13,935
Helen. My dad called me "H."
It kinda stuck. Let's go!

1059
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:25,975
That thing's IDing my van.

1060
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:42,832
Come on. They've spotted us.

1061
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:45,199
Daito.

1062
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:48,040
My real name is Toshiro.
Samantha got us a message.

1063
01:16:48,041 --> 01:16:49,866
She told us to meet you here.

1064
01:16:49,871 --> 01:16:51,271
Samantha,
they took her to the...

1065
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:53,307
The loyalty center, I know.

1066
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:56,878
Look, in other awesome news,
the Sixers found the third challenge.

1067
01:16:56,879 --> 01:16:58,778
- What?
- Just come on, get in!

1068
01:16:58,780 --> 01:16:59,980
All right. Let's go.

1069
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:02,182
Hurry up.
Go, go, go. All right.

1070
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:16,395
How did IOI find
the third challenge so fast?

1071
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:18,498
IOI cracked the first
three lines of the clue,

1072
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,167
so they knew it was sector 14

1073
01:17:20,168 --> 01:17:21,768
but they couldn't figure out
"the fortress tragic."

1074
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:24,170
So they sent every guide
they had into that sector

1075
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:26,142
until they found
the right fortress.

1076
01:17:27,175 --> 01:17:28,635
Sho?

1077
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,954
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm 11, so what?

1078
01:17:30,955 --> 01:17:32,976
His real name is Xo.

1079
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:35,751
But everyone else calls me Sho,
no big deal.

1080
01:17:35,752 --> 01:17:38,519
No. It is a big deal.

1081
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:42,090
Sho, you're the world's most
badass 11-year-old ever.

1082
01:17:42,091 --> 01:17:43,157
He knows.

1083
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:45,358
Shut up! Let him tell me.

1084
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,500
Aech!

1085
01:17:49,965 --> 01:17:51,665
We have to go save Samantha.

1086
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:54,035
Well, we can't just
go through the doors of IOI.

1087
01:17:54,036 --> 01:17:56,266
Look, I've been thinkin' about it.
I got a better plan.

1088
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:58,271
You saw Sorrento's rig, right?

1089
01:17:58,273 --> 01:18:00,374
Yeah.

1090
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:02,805
Let's go after the man himself and
make him give Art3mis back to us.

1091
01:18:02,811 --> 01:18:04,711
But first,
I have to know exactly,

1092
01:18:04,713 --> 01:18:06,723
how much about Sorrento's rig
do you remember?

1093
01:18:08,116 --> 01:18:10,416
Kind of everything.

1094
01:18:24,132 --> 01:18:28,042
Maintenance,
report to loyalty pod 31-B.

1095
01:18:32,074 --> 01:18:36,714
Security, please report
to section 97 for escort.

1096
01:18:57,432 --> 01:19:00,302
Hey! Newbie, get to work.

1097
01:19:02,437 --> 01:19:03,567
Get to work.

1098
01:19:09,878 --> 01:19:13,008
- Work violation.
- Work violation.

1099
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:17,850
Lay those charges
every six feet.

1100
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:25,028
Keep it moving!

1101
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:27,364
Hey, you!

1102
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:31,304
Those are explosives!

1103
01:19:33,034 --> 01:19:36,244
IOI will not reimburse
any lost coin if you zero out.

1104
01:19:36,245 --> 01:19:38,038
Keep it moving!

1105
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:45,784
So what is this challenge,
some sort of video game thing?

1106
01:19:45,785 --> 01:19:47,881
An Atari 2600, sir.

1107
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:51,493
And every game ever made for it,
thousands of possibilities.

1108
01:19:52,254 --> 01:19:53,624
Come up!

1109
01:19:58,093 --> 01:19:59,560
Halliday,

1110
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:01,495
this is how
you plan to resolve

1111
01:20:01,496 --> 01:20:04,926
the fate of the world's most
important economic resource?

1112
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:06,903
- Call me when you're close.
- Yes, sir.

1113
01:20:06,904 --> 01:20:08,502
Go, go! No! Ahh!

1114
01:20:10,772 --> 01:20:13,942
One minute into Centipede,
the ice broke.

1115
01:20:13,943 --> 01:20:16,010
It has to be Joust!

1116
01:20:16,011 --> 01:20:18,951
Halliday still holds the world record
on the 2600 port of that game.

1117
01:20:18,952 --> 01:20:20,947
Maybe we just need
to beat his high score.

1118
01:20:20,949 --> 01:20:23,249
Pitfall! One of the only 2600
games that still hasn't ended.

1119
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:24,691
And how about
those Swordquest games?

1120
01:20:24,692 --> 01:20:26,586
Yes!
The Swordquest games.

1121
01:20:26,588 --> 01:20:28,658
They were created for a contest
Atari held with real...

1122
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:39,331
i-R0k, how are we doin'?

1123
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:41,604
To be honest, I think I need
physical therapy because it's not...

1124
01:20:41,605 --> 01:20:43,673
Is the Orb ready?

1125
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:46,336
Um, as you wish.

1126
01:20:50,445 --> 01:20:51,605
The Orb...

1127
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:53,083
Of Osuvox.

1128
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:55,049
Ah...

1129
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:57,117
How does it work?

1130
01:20:57,118 --> 01:21:00,558
Has it got, like,
a remote or is there a button or something?

1131
01:21:00,559 --> 01:21:04,185
Nolan, it's a level-99
magic artifact,

1132
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:08,002
not one of your drones,
so it is activated by a magic spell.

1133
01:21:08,003 --> 01:21:10,096
Would you care
to do the honors?

1134
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:03,384
Where is she?

1135
01:22:03,385 --> 01:22:04,685
How'd you get in here?

1136
01:22:04,686 --> 01:22:05,946
- Art3mis.
- Who?

1137
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:10,624
Samantha Cook. Where is she?

1138
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:14,525
If you wanna talk, we can talk,
but you gotta put that gun down.

1139
01:22:14,529 --> 01:22:17,429
You killed my mom's sister.

1140
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:19,066
You think I won't kill you?

1141
01:22:19,067 --> 01:22:23,267
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Just slow down, okay?

1142
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:26,641
That was a corporate decision.
It was not personal.

1143
01:22:26,642 --> 01:22:27,975
Where is she?

1144
01:22:27,976 --> 01:22:30,306
She's downstairs
in the loyalty center!

1145
01:22:30,312 --> 01:22:33,214
I know she's in
the goddamn loyalty center.

1146
01:22:33,215 --> 01:22:36,118
You're gonna tell me
exactly which rig she's in

1147
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:38,517
and the access code
to contact her.

1148
01:22:39,554 --> 01:22:41,864
Yeah, that seems appropriate.

1149
01:22:44,659 --> 01:22:46,729
Start with access code.

1150
01:22:47,896 --> 01:22:49,695
6, 45, 7, 25.

1151
01:22:49,696 --> 01:22:51,495
Where's the rig?

1152
01:23:02,344 --> 01:23:04,578
I think he pissed himself.

1153
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:06,579
Good job, Z.
We're in his account.

1154
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:08,381
So he really doesn't know
he's in the OASIS?

1155
01:23:10,685 --> 01:23:13,285
This is what Sorrento
should be seeing,

1156
01:23:13,288 --> 01:23:17,524
but this... This is what we're
making him see.

1157
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:20,595
We grabbed him in transit just as
he was logging out of the OASIS,

1158
01:23:20,596 --> 01:23:23,464
so he thinks he's back in his
office in the real world.

1159
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:27,295
But actually, he's here,
in the identical office that Aech built.

1160
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:30,004
So, you basically
just remotely hacked his rig.

1161
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:33,035
A fixed rig like Sorrento's is
easy to locate, hard to hack.

1162
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:35,781
Unless he's stupid enough to
leave his password lying around.

1163
01:23:35,782 --> 01:23:37,177
Loyalty center, I'm in.

1164
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:39,008
All right,
let's get to work.

1165
01:23:46,721 --> 01:23:49,056
- Arty.
- Z? Z? Z?

1166
01:23:49,057 --> 01:23:50,624
Arty, don't say anything.

1167
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:52,625
I'm tapped directly
into your audio feed.

1168
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:55,695
How did you find me?

1169
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:57,467
We got his password,
hacked Sorrento's rig.

1170
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:01,502
Z, I have something
to tell you.

1171
01:24:01,503 --> 01:24:03,513
Not now. I have something to show
you that'll get you out of there.

1172
01:24:03,514 --> 01:24:06,975
The Sixers found the third challenge.
It's on Planet Doom.

1173
01:24:06,976 --> 01:24:08,505
And there's more,
they just put a force field

1174
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:10,380
around Anorak's Castle.

1175
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:17,368
I heard one of the guards calling it
"the Orb of Osuvox,"

1176
01:24:17,369 --> 01:24:19,989
and the only way to take it
down is from the inside.

1177
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:23,157
She's right.
Level-99 artifact,

1178
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:26,088
creates a magic-resistant,
impenetrable barrier.

1179
01:24:26,094 --> 01:24:27,828
No way through it.

1180
01:24:27,829 --> 01:24:29,559
Okay, listen.
That's not important right now.

1181
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:30,974
What's important is that
we get you out of the rig.

1182
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:36,071
All right, so I'm looking
at a diagram of your rig.

1183
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,872
If you reach up with your
left hand at 11 o'clock,

1184
01:24:40,873 --> 01:24:43,006
there's some...
there's a panel above your head.

1185
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:49,917
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I can feel it.

1186
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:51,948
Okay, there should be
two release handles.

1187
01:24:51,953 --> 01:24:53,905
Nine o'clock and three o'clock.
Can you feel them?

1188
01:24:53,906 --> 01:24:55,858
- Yeah, I got it.
- Okay, pull it towards you.

1189
01:24:58,193 --> 01:25:00,094
Okay, inside the panel,
there's a lever.

1190
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:02,455
Grab it with your right hand
and slide it to the left.

1191
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:03,974
That should release you.

1192
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:13,979
It worked. It worked, I'm out.

1193
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:16,105
Loyalty pod 41-F,

1194
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:19,111
you are on an authorized
break for 10 minutes.

1195
01:25:24,385 --> 01:25:27,555
Pod 41-F, you are
on 10-minute break.

1196
01:25:27,556 --> 01:25:29,715
Proceed to break area.

1197
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:32,257
Wade, are you still there?

1198
01:25:32,258 --> 01:25:33,557
Yeah, I'm here. Where are you?

1199
01:25:33,561 --> 01:25:35,761
Where is Sorrento's office?

1200
01:25:35,763 --> 01:25:37,173
It's in the IOI war room,
two levels above where you are now.

1201
01:25:37,174 --> 01:25:38,965
But that's not the way out.

1202
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:40,567
What's his password?

1203
01:25:41,836 --> 01:25:43,236
Wade, answer me.

1204
01:25:43,238 --> 01:25:47,178
Okay, it's capital
B-0-55-man-69.

1205
01:25:47,179 --> 01:25:49,575
But, Arty, you need to go.

1206
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:50,907
You need to raise an army.

1207
01:25:51,779 --> 01:25:53,409
An army?

1208
01:25:53,414 --> 01:25:55,024
Get to Planet Doom,
and wait for my signal.

1209
01:25:55,025 --> 01:25:56,316
What signal?

1210
01:25:56,317 --> 01:25:58,447
I'm gonna take down
that shield.

1211
01:25:58,453 --> 01:26:00,193
Wait, Arty, wait!
You gotta get out of there! Arty!

1212
01:26:08,796 --> 01:26:11,426
Hey, how much
are they paying you?

1213
01:26:11,432 --> 01:26:13,200
'Cause, man,
I got a lot of paper.

1214
01:26:13,201 --> 01:26:15,601
You know, I can make you,
like, a forest.

1215
01:26:15,603 --> 01:26:17,873
Hey, shut up.

1216
01:26:17,874 --> 01:26:19,042
Okay.

1217
01:26:41,629 --> 01:26:43,869
This isn't real,
you're tapping my feed.

1218
01:26:43,870 --> 01:26:45,925
Uh-oh. Guys.

1219
01:27:04,419 --> 01:27:07,159
F'Nale, they've hacked my rig.
They're after the girl.

1220
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:09,415
Meet me at loyalty.

1221
01:27:22,937 --> 01:27:26,537
Pod 41-F,
you have exceeded your break time.

1222
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:30,311
Report to security or your coin
count will be reset to zero.

1223
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:44,030
So, she just walks out of here,
how does that happen?

1224
01:27:44,031 --> 01:27:46,285
They're smart. They knew
what they were doing.

1225
01:27:46,294 --> 01:27:49,134
But we know they're in Columbus.
And now, all five of them are together.

1226
01:27:49,135 --> 01:27:51,630
Wait. Wait, we know what?
How do we know?

1227
01:27:51,633 --> 01:27:55,403
We have the make and model of the van.
We'll spot them.

1228
01:27:55,404 --> 01:27:57,537
"We'll spot them"?

1229
01:27:57,538 --> 01:28:00,778
That sounds like a great
inscription for our tombstones.

1230
01:28:00,779 --> 01:28:02,305
Why didn't you tell me
this earlier?

1231
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:03,910
It wasn't relevant yet.

1232
01:28:03,911 --> 01:28:05,311
I need to know where they are.

1233
01:28:05,313 --> 01:28:06,713
We need to know.
We need to find them!

1234
01:28:06,714 --> 01:28:09,750
They're kids, Nolan.
Man the hell up!

1235
01:28:09,751 --> 01:28:12,951
Do your job, and I'll do mine,
unless you wanna take this

1236
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:15,024
and go after them yourself.

1237
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:20,860
Find them!

1238
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:34,484
The Complete Nancy Drew,
Kegel Exercises for...

1239
01:28:36,077 --> 01:28:38,807
Bingo. Okay.

1240
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:41,083
"Congratulations,
you are the proud owner of the Orb of Osuvox,

1241
01:28:41,084 --> 01:28:43,016
"a 99th level magic artifact.

1242
01:28:43,017 --> 01:28:45,847
"Read these instructions before deploying.
To turn orb on, off."

1243
01:28:45,853 --> 01:28:47,354
Off! Yes, off.

1244
01:28:47,355 --> 01:28:49,685
"Utter spell
within 10 feet of orb."

1245
01:29:03,604 --> 01:29:05,806
Citizens of the OASIS,

1246
01:29:05,807 --> 01:29:08,637
I am Parzival,
first to the key.

1247
01:29:08,643 --> 01:29:11,683
I'm here talking to all of you now
because our future's being threatened

1248
01:29:11,684 --> 01:29:15,779
by people who will stop at
nothing to win this contest.

1249
01:29:15,783 --> 01:29:17,818
Some of you already know this,

1250
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:21,789
and you've lost much more than
just your avatars or your weapons.

1251
01:29:21,790 --> 01:29:25,729
Some have lost their freedom.
Some have lost their lives.

1252
01:29:28,162 --> 01:29:30,964
And now, this.

1253
01:29:30,965 --> 01:29:33,965
A force field
around the third challenge.

1254
01:29:36,471 --> 01:29:40,481
I only came here to escape the
shitty hand that life dealt me.

1255
01:29:40,482 --> 01:29:43,235
But I stayed,
like many of you,

1256
01:29:43,244 --> 01:29:48,354
because I found something
much bigger than just myself.

1257
01:29:48,355 --> 01:29:50,219
I found a cause.

1258
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:54,588
I found my friends.

1259
01:29:54,589 --> 01:29:58,089
And yes, I know
it's kind of a groaner, but...

1260
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,000
I found love.

1261
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,864
And I don't wanna lose that

1262
01:30:03,865 --> 01:30:06,525
to this colossal douchebag,
Nolan Sorrento.

1263
01:30:06,534 --> 01:30:10,737
This guy.
Back to work, people.

1264
01:30:10,738 --> 01:30:15,008
He thinks that we're all too
distracted to even notice...

1265
01:30:15,009 --> 01:30:19,779
Nolan Sorrento thinks
that we won't put up a fight.

1266
01:30:19,781 --> 01:30:21,047
Sir! Sir!

1267
01:30:21,048 --> 01:30:22,848
This is going out live!

1268
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:24,950
The only thing
Halliday let this guy do...

1269
01:30:24,952 --> 01:30:26,622
- It's absolutely everywhere.
- ...was get him a cup of coffee.

1270
01:30:26,623 --> 01:30:27,521
And now, we're supposed
to hand him the OASIS?

1271
01:30:35,396 --> 01:30:38,196
This Parzival...
Oh, man.

1272
01:30:42,236 --> 01:30:44,736
Come on, come on.
Give me this thing.

1273
01:30:44,739 --> 01:30:45,939
Yes, sir.

1274
01:30:46,574 --> 01:30:48,708
Left arm.

1275
01:30:48,709 --> 01:30:51,209
- Left arm!
- Sir.

1276
01:30:51,212 --> 01:30:53,212
No, I need the left arm.

1277
01:30:53,214 --> 01:30:55,554
No, I don't care if...
I want it on.

1278
01:30:57,385 --> 01:31:00,145
He thinks that we won't
even put up a fight!

1279
01:31:00,154 --> 01:31:02,956
Well, I say he's wrong.

1280
01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:06,757
I say, tell that to the gunter
clans in the gold mines of Gygax.

1281
01:31:06,761 --> 01:31:10,001
Activate the Iron Giant.

1282
01:31:34,088 --> 01:31:39,158
Ask yourselves,
are you willing to zero out for the OASIS?

1283
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:41,100
Are you willing to fight?

1284
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:45,097
I am Parzival
of the High Five.

1285
01:31:45,099 --> 01:31:47,839
In the name of Art3mis,
in the name of Aech,

1286
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:50,535
in the name of Daito and Sho,

1287
01:31:50,538 --> 01:31:53,872
we ask you to join us
on Planet Doom.

1288
01:31:53,873 --> 01:31:57,208
In the name
of James Halliday himself,

1289
01:31:57,211 --> 01:31:59,281
help us save the OASIS.

1290
01:32:54,235 --> 01:32:56,665
No, no, no, no.

1291
01:33:06,747 --> 01:33:09,377
"No man is a failure
who has friends."

1292
01:33:31,472 --> 01:33:34,712
Squadron 14, armor up,
you're in the lead.

1293
01:33:47,588 --> 01:33:51,988
One minute into Swordquest,
the ice broke.

1294
01:33:51,993 --> 01:33:55,763
Well, all three Swordquests.
What's next?

1295
01:33:55,764 --> 01:33:57,603
Dark Cavern, Laser Blast.

1296
01:33:57,604 --> 01:33:58,828
It's Adventure.

1297
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:01,101
Released in 1979,
for the 2600,

1298
01:34:01,102 --> 01:34:03,169
Adventure was created by
Warren Robinett,

1299
01:34:03,170 --> 01:34:05,340
who was the first video game designer
ever to hide his name. In fact...

1300
01:34:05,341 --> 01:34:07,409
Try Adventure.

1301
01:34:08,609 --> 01:34:10,179
Play Adventure.

1302
01:35:02,496 --> 01:35:04,826
More than a minute,
we're still alive.

1303
01:35:04,832 --> 01:35:06,872
This must be the right game.

1304
01:35:13,641 --> 01:35:16,481
How long does it last,
this orb thing?

1305
01:35:23,884 --> 01:35:26,653
I'd say about ten...

1306
01:35:26,654 --> 01:35:30,024
Yeah, about 10 million years,
so we should be fine.

1307
01:35:47,208 --> 01:35:49,056
First to the key!

1308
01:35:49,057 --> 01:35:50,906
First to the egg!

1309
01:35:50,911 --> 01:35:53,781
First to the egg!

1310
01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:23,739
Adventure.

1311
01:36:39,627 --> 01:36:41,897
What? Come on!

1312
01:37:11,458 --> 01:37:13,088
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1313
01:37:15,196 --> 01:37:17,966
The Sixers are in the final challenge.
It's an Atari 2600.

1314
01:37:17,967 --> 01:37:20,195
Are you in the Sixer war room?

1315
01:37:20,201 --> 01:37:21,801
No, no, no.
You gotta get out of there.

1316
01:37:21,802 --> 01:37:24,102
They're playing Adventure.

1317
01:37:24,104 --> 01:37:26,506
Adventure, of course!

1318
01:37:26,507 --> 01:37:28,307
Created by Warren Robinett!

1319
01:37:28,309 --> 01:37:29,839
He was the first designer to
ever hide an Easter egg in...

1320
01:37:29,844 --> 01:37:30,914
Dude!

1321
01:37:35,883 --> 01:37:38,723
We're looking for a USPS truck,
Ohio plates,

1322
01:37:38,724 --> 01:37:41,789
a drone spitter, 2036 model.

1323
01:38:00,307 --> 01:38:03,707
Daito! When are you
getting into this fight?

1324
01:38:17,658 --> 01:38:18,888
I'm out. Inventory's empty.

1325
01:38:18,893 --> 01:38:20,076
Last clip for me.

1326
01:38:20,077 --> 01:38:21,260
More weapons!

1327
01:38:21,262 --> 01:38:25,432
Anti-personnel
ordinance cannon!

1328
01:38:28,335 --> 01:38:31,065
Railgun!

1329
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:37,910
Yo, Z!

1330
01:38:37,912 --> 01:38:41,622
Yo, Z! Try this little guy.

1331
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:46,786
Ow!

1332
01:38:46,787 --> 01:38:48,687
Get rid of it! Get rid of it!

1333
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:51,627
It's fucking Chucky!

1334
01:38:56,897 --> 01:38:58,711
Move! Move!

1335
01:38:58,712 --> 01:39:00,526
Go, go, go!

1336
01:39:58,258 --> 01:39:59,828
Mechagodzilla!

1337
01:40:20,948 --> 01:40:24,448
Daito, we need you!
Daito, now!

1338
01:40:24,451 --> 01:40:26,691
Get to the bridge.
Go now, he's distracted.

1339
01:40:26,692 --> 01:40:27,757
Go, go, go.

1340
01:41:09,029 --> 01:41:10,099
Z!

1341
01:41:29,950 --> 01:41:31,750
Arty!

1342
01:41:31,752 --> 01:41:33,352
Get to the castle!
Win the third key before they do!

1343
01:41:45,065 --> 01:41:46,765
What is that?

1344
01:41:46,767 --> 01:41:49,197
He's only got 30 seconds
before changing back!

1345
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:03,320
Daito, abort, abort!
You got 10 seconds!

1346
01:42:17,931 --> 01:42:19,201
First to the egg!

1347
01:42:58,605 --> 01:42:59,935
Shit, it's her.

1348
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:23,296
Arty! Arty!

1349
01:43:23,297 --> 01:43:25,827
Z! Got to get
to the castle!

1350
01:43:31,838 --> 01:43:34,468
She never left.
She's still here.

1351
01:43:37,377 --> 01:43:38,977
The girl's in the war room.

1352
01:44:17,050 --> 01:44:18,650
No, no, no.

1353
01:44:32,733 --> 01:44:35,343
Sho! Hang on!

1354
01:44:54,721 --> 01:44:56,361
No!

1355
01:45:18,779 --> 01:45:20,679
Arty, we've got this.
You need to log out.

1356
01:45:20,681 --> 01:45:23,451
If the game is Adventure,
why haven't they won yet?

1357
01:45:23,452 --> 01:45:25,318
I don't know. Arty, Arty.

1358
01:45:25,319 --> 01:45:27,319
I'm serious, Sorrento's crazy.
He'll kill you.

1359
01:45:29,489 --> 01:45:31,373
What are you looking at?

1360
01:45:31,374 --> 01:45:33,258
There's nothing over there.

1361
01:45:34,261 --> 01:45:35,331
You're in trouble, aren't you?

1362
01:45:38,699 --> 01:45:42,269
Samantha, you know I love you.

1363
01:45:42,270 --> 01:45:43,636
Not the time, Z.

1364
01:45:43,637 --> 01:45:45,204
I can handle the challenge,

1365
01:45:45,205 --> 01:45:48,304
but I can't let you get hurt
in the real world.

1366
01:45:48,305 --> 01:45:51,405
Get out of IOI,
and meet us at River South.

1367
01:45:57,718 --> 01:45:59,448
Wade, no.

1368
01:45:59,453 --> 01:46:01,323
You'll forgive me
for this, I promise.

1369
01:46:01,324 --> 01:46:02,521
Wade, no, no, no.

1370
01:46:12,566 --> 01:46:16,036
Get it together, Sixer.
Back to respawn.

1371
01:46:16,037 --> 01:46:17,366
Let's go, move.

1372
01:46:17,371 --> 01:46:18,641
You're in.

1373
01:46:36,857 --> 01:46:39,487
Holy hand grenade!
How much did that cost?

1374
01:46:39,493 --> 01:46:42,003
Less than
it's gonna cost them.

1375
01:46:43,063 --> 01:46:44,633
What is that?

1376
01:46:54,941 --> 01:46:57,681
Sir, the gunters
are approaching the challenge.

1377
01:46:57,682 --> 01:46:59,677
- i-R0k?
- In position, sir.

1378
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:00,946
Prepare my rig.

1379
01:47:00,947 --> 01:47:03,647
The ice is holding.
Still going.

1380
01:47:13,927 --> 01:47:15,257
Wait.

1381
01:47:15,262 --> 01:47:16,462
He's trying to win.

1382
01:47:19,766 --> 01:47:22,366
Yeah! I won.

1383
01:47:25,806 --> 01:47:27,766
He lost.

1384
01:47:27,774 --> 01:47:29,844
Not Adventure.

1385
01:47:33,914 --> 01:47:38,384
Everyone who wins loses.

1386
01:47:38,385 --> 01:47:41,715
It's not about winning.
It's about playing.

1387
01:47:42,789 --> 01:47:45,289
Remember
Halliday's announcement.

1388
01:47:45,292 --> 01:47:47,732
The keys are invisible,
and they're hidden in a dark room

1389
01:47:47,733 --> 01:47:50,296
that's at the center
of a maze.

1390
01:47:50,297 --> 01:47:53,967
Well, there's a secret in Adventure,
and you don't find it by winning.

1391
01:47:53,968 --> 01:47:56,897
You find it by wandering
around in a dark room.

1392
01:47:56,903 --> 01:47:58,604
Until you get
to the invisible dot.

1393
01:47:58,605 --> 01:48:00,305
It's pretty easy
if you know what you're doing.

1394
01:48:00,307 --> 01:48:01,637
Really?

1395
01:48:02,476 --> 01:48:04,846
Let me finish it for you.

1396
01:48:08,815 --> 01:48:10,745
It's your last chance, Wade.

1397
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:13,650
Last chance. Give me the key.

1398
01:48:13,653 --> 01:48:18,693
I give you 50 million
in your account right now.

1399
01:48:18,694 --> 01:48:20,532
Why the hell
would I ever do that?

1400
01:48:22,262 --> 01:48:24,179
Dude!
That's the Cataclyst.

1401
01:48:24,180 --> 01:48:26,097
Now, personally, I don't care.

1402
01:48:26,099 --> 01:48:27,829
I'd just as soon never set
foot in the OASIS again,

1403
01:48:27,834 --> 01:48:30,002
let alone have to deal
with any of this absurdity.

1404
01:48:30,003 --> 01:48:35,207
But I know how important Halliday's
competition is to you, so...

1405
01:48:35,208 --> 01:48:39,648
I will never let the future of the OASIS
rest in your hands, Nolan Sorrento.

1406
01:48:39,649 --> 01:48:43,676
Well, that's fine.
Three easy steps. One.

1407
01:48:43,683 --> 01:48:46,153
Wait, I thought you were bluffing.
You know that kills all of us, right?

1408
01:48:46,154 --> 01:48:48,222
I've got 10 years' worth
of shit inside of me.

1409
01:48:48,223 --> 01:48:49,889
Last chance. Two.

1410
01:48:49,890 --> 01:48:51,290
I'm not goin' out like that.

1411
01:48:51,291 --> 01:48:52,825
That's a camper move.

1412
01:48:52,826 --> 01:48:53,956
You don't even know
how to activate an orb.

1413
01:49:06,139 --> 01:49:07,269
Yeah, I felt those.

1414
01:49:08,642 --> 01:49:10,782
But this is my world,
Sorrento.

1415
01:49:14,681 --> 01:49:15,981
Hadouken!

1416
01:49:35,535 --> 01:49:38,165
- No, no, no!
- Step three.

1417
01:49:38,171 --> 01:49:39,941
No, no, no!

1418
01:50:37,397 --> 01:50:39,127
Get me out of this thing.

1419
01:50:53,513 --> 01:50:54,880
Uh...

1420
01:50:54,881 --> 01:50:56,248
Guys?

1421
01:51:02,789 --> 01:51:04,689
Z. He's still alive!

1422
01:51:12,532 --> 01:51:14,402
Extra life.

1423
01:51:16,770 --> 01:51:18,240
Thanks, Curator.

1424
01:51:21,041 --> 01:51:22,241
Hold on.

1425
01:51:29,949 --> 01:51:32,549
Live feed
in all OASIS channels.

1426
01:51:32,552 --> 01:51:35,162
Halliday's letting everyone
watch the end of the contest.

1427
01:51:35,163 --> 01:51:36,515
That's so Halliday.

1428
01:51:36,523 --> 01:51:38,793
God damn it,
we tried Adventure.

1429
01:51:38,794 --> 01:51:40,359
No, we tried to win it.

1430
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:42,828
But the hidden room isn't
at the end of the game.

1431
01:51:42,829 --> 01:51:45,399
You've gotta go straight to the
invisible dot at the start.

1432
01:51:59,012 --> 01:52:00,979
Is that her?

1433
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:04,380
Red hair, IOI uniform,
doesn't know what planet she's on?

1434
01:52:04,384 --> 01:52:05,494
That's her.

1435
01:52:17,263 --> 01:52:20,073
I'm Toshiro.
You know me as Daito.

1436
01:52:22,902 --> 01:52:24,002
Oh.

1437
01:52:26,706 --> 01:52:28,166
Hey, Arty.

1438
01:52:30,176 --> 01:52:34,346
Yeah, I know. Not what
you were expecting, huh?

1439
01:52:34,347 --> 01:52:38,947
Yeah, I wasn't expecting
a late '30s-model postal van.

1440
01:52:40,954 --> 01:52:43,122
Wade?

1441
01:52:43,123 --> 01:52:45,093
Wait, I thought the Cataclyst went off.
How are you still playing?

1442
01:52:45,094 --> 01:52:47,661
Extra life, long story.
Sorry I shot you.

1443
01:52:49,929 --> 01:52:51,559
Sho?

1444
01:52:51,564 --> 01:52:54,099
What? Do I have to wear
a sign saying,

1445
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:57,240
"I am 11 years old, shoot me first"?
No, thanks.

1446
01:52:57,241 --> 01:52:59,567
- Dude, give me a hug.
- Ninjas don't hug!

1447
01:52:59,572 --> 01:53:01,142
All right, everybody,
hold on to somethin'.

1448
01:53:22,896 --> 01:53:24,226
Got you.

1449
01:53:27,934 --> 01:53:29,704
Come on, Nolan. Pick up.

1450
01:53:31,838 --> 01:53:34,668
F'Nale, tell me
something good.

1451
01:53:34,674 --> 01:53:37,244
I've got a drone on their tail.
I'm close.

1452
01:53:37,245 --> 01:53:38,510
Send me coordinates.

1453
01:53:38,511 --> 01:53:40,751
Maybe you should
leave this to me, Nolan.

1454
01:53:42,515 --> 01:53:45,185
Nolan? Nolan.

1455
01:53:46,586 --> 01:53:47,746
Out.

1456
01:53:56,663 --> 01:53:59,203
Give me that.

1457
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:04,596
What's goin' on out there?

1458
01:54:08,942 --> 01:54:11,442
- The game is over for them.
- What are they watching?

1459
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:16,250
The final key!
It's being broadcast.

1460
01:54:18,284 --> 01:54:19,952
You see,

1461
01:54:19,953 --> 01:54:22,838
Warren Robinett
was proud of Adventure.

1462
01:54:22,839 --> 01:54:25,724
He wanted people to know
who was behind it.

1463
01:54:25,725 --> 01:54:28,455
That's why he created
the first digital Easter egg

1464
01:54:28,461 --> 01:54:31,161
and to find it,
you didn't even have to win.

1465
01:54:31,164 --> 01:54:35,344
You just had to blindly play,
searching around

1466
01:54:35,345 --> 01:54:39,465
in rooms for an invisible dot.

1467
01:54:39,472 --> 01:54:42,040
You took the dot
back to the main screen

1468
01:54:42,041 --> 01:54:46,681
and that's when you found the first
Easter egg ever put in a video game.

1469
01:54:46,682 --> 01:54:47,979
The creator's name.

1470
01:55:12,605 --> 01:55:14,705
What's going on, man?
I can't see shit.

1471
01:55:14,707 --> 01:55:16,137
Parzival just got
the Crystal Key!

1472
01:55:31,391 --> 01:55:33,161
Do you want it or not?

1473
01:55:36,429 --> 01:55:38,529
Aech,
what the hell's going on?

1474
01:55:38,531 --> 01:55:40,531
Just practicing Mario Kart.
What do you think?

1475
01:55:40,533 --> 01:55:42,643
IOI's trying to kill us, man!

1476
01:55:56,816 --> 01:55:59,146
Everyone watching,
if you're in the Columbus stacks,

1477
01:55:59,152 --> 01:56:01,219
this is Parzival.

1478
01:56:01,220 --> 01:56:03,420
My real-world name is Wade Watts,
and we're gonna need your help.

1479
01:56:03,423 --> 01:56:04,993
Aech, head for the stacks!

1480
01:56:04,994 --> 01:56:07,261
Okay, hold on!

1481
01:56:31,918 --> 01:56:33,918
Stick the key in,
how hard is it?

1482
01:56:39,592 --> 01:56:40,832
Come on.

1483
01:56:48,201 --> 01:56:50,271
Yeah! Yes!

1484
01:57:06,452 --> 01:57:07,722
That's it?

1485
01:57:08,488 --> 01:57:10,355
Yeah, that's it.

1486
01:57:10,356 --> 01:57:14,856
Now, you just sign these papers,
and the OASIS is yours.

1487
01:57:14,861 --> 01:57:19,171
You will be
its sole proprietor.

1488
01:57:19,172 --> 01:57:20,695
That ain't so bad, is it?

1489
01:57:42,488 --> 01:57:43,588
I'm gonna need a second.

1490
01:58:12,218 --> 01:58:14,848
This is wrong.

1491
01:58:14,854 --> 01:58:17,794
This pen, this contract.

1492
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:22,730
This is the moment
that Halliday made Morrow

1493
01:58:22,731 --> 01:58:25,297
sign over his shares
in Gregarious.

1494
01:58:25,298 --> 01:58:27,968
That was the biggest mistake
of his life.

1495
01:58:27,969 --> 01:58:30,167
He knew that.

1496
01:58:31,871 --> 01:58:33,971
This can't be the end.

1497
01:58:35,108 --> 01:58:36,878
It's a test.

1498
01:58:41,380 --> 01:58:44,120
I won't make
the same mistake you did.

1499
01:58:49,755 --> 01:58:51,685
Oh, good.

1500
01:58:54,327 --> 01:58:57,827
I just needed to be sure.

1501
01:59:11,777 --> 01:59:14,047
This is where you grew up.

1502
01:59:23,256 --> 01:59:26,186
Oh, that's just me
a long time ago.

1503
01:59:26,192 --> 01:59:29,802
I like to have him around
from time to time.

1504
01:59:29,803 --> 01:59:32,095
Hey, I have
to show you something.

1505
01:59:32,098 --> 01:59:33,798
This, uh... Come on.

1506
01:59:33,799 --> 01:59:35,634
This is the button.

1507
01:59:35,635 --> 01:59:38,935
If you push it,
the whole simulation shuts down

1508
01:59:38,938 --> 01:59:42,538
and a tapeworm program will
erase all of the backup servers.

1509
01:59:42,542 --> 01:59:46,312
So you now have the power
to turn the OASIS off forever.

1510
01:59:46,313 --> 01:59:47,952
Do you understand?

1511
01:59:53,319 --> 01:59:54,486
Yeah,

1512
01:59:54,487 --> 01:59:56,454
try not to accidentally erase

1513
01:59:56,455 --> 01:59:59,185
the whole of the OASIS
on your first day.

1514
02:00:08,501 --> 02:00:10,271
The stacks are straight ahead!

1515
02:00:26,018 --> 02:00:28,987
Well, I expect you have to go.
I know I do.

1516
02:00:28,988 --> 02:00:31,518
So, now is the time for you
to receive your prize

1517
02:00:31,524 --> 02:00:34,059
because you won
all three keys.

1518
02:00:34,060 --> 02:00:38,760
Once you take this egg,
the game will be over.

1519
02:00:38,764 --> 02:00:41,904
The egg, the egg...

1520
02:00:49,275 --> 02:00:51,705
We know what you did here.

1521
02:00:51,711 --> 02:00:55,081
You turn around and walk out
of here while you still can.

1522
02:01:07,627 --> 02:01:10,195
I created the OASIS

1523
02:01:10,196 --> 02:01:14,926
because I never felt at home
in the real world.

1524
02:01:14,934 --> 02:01:19,414
I just didn't know how to
connect with the people there.

1525
02:01:19,415 --> 02:01:22,905
I was afraid
for all of my life.

1526
02:01:22,908 --> 02:01:25,708
Right up until the day
I knew my life was ending.

1527
02:01:31,284 --> 02:01:36,371
Now, that... That was when
I realized that,

1528
02:01:36,372 --> 02:01:41,459
as terrifying and painful
as reality can be,

1529
02:01:42,261 --> 02:01:46,331
it's also the only place

1530
02:01:47,933 --> 02:01:49,643
that you can get
a decent meal.

1531
02:01:56,242 --> 02:01:57,812
Because

1532
02:01:59,478 --> 02:02:01,148
reality

1533
02:02:06,252 --> 02:02:07,919
is real.

1534
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:09,690
You understand
what I'm saying?

1535
02:02:11,457 --> 02:02:14,157
Yes. Yes, I do.

1536
02:02:23,869 --> 02:02:25,199
He did it.

1537
02:02:26,839 --> 02:02:28,369
He got the egg.

1538
02:02:29,141 --> 02:02:30,441
Hooray.

1539
02:02:31,544 --> 02:02:33,254
- No!
- No! Please!

1540
02:03:06,746 --> 02:03:08,076
Hold it!

1541
02:03:10,082 --> 02:03:13,852
Drop the gun! Now!
On the ground!

1542
02:03:13,853 --> 02:03:16,593
Turn around!
Hands on your head.

1543
02:03:16,594 --> 02:03:18,219
Walk back towards me.

1544
02:03:33,873 --> 02:03:39,113
Mr. Halliday.
Something I don't understand.

1545
02:03:39,114 --> 02:03:41,911
You're not an avatar, are you?

1546
02:03:42,448 --> 02:03:44,148
No.

1547
02:03:45,618 --> 02:03:47,688
Is Halliday really dead?

1548
02:03:49,288 --> 02:03:50,958
Yes.

1549
02:03:56,629 --> 02:03:58,459
Then what are you?

1550
02:04:01,634 --> 02:04:03,674
Goodbye, Parzival.

1551
02:04:05,271 --> 02:04:06,441
Thanks.

1552
02:04:07,907 --> 02:04:10,177
Thanks for playing my game.

1553
02:04:39,138 --> 02:04:40,508
Wade?

1554
02:04:41,841 --> 02:04:43,781
- Ogden Morrow?
- Ogden Morrow?

1555
02:04:43,782 --> 02:04:45,944
You can call me "Og."

1556
02:04:45,945 --> 02:04:48,905
Now, there are some people out here
that would very much like to meet you.

1557
02:04:48,914 --> 02:04:52,150
Wow, this is incredible.

1558
02:04:52,151 --> 02:04:54,991
It's an honor to meet you,
Og, but I...

1559
02:04:59,124 --> 02:05:00,864
There's something
I need to do first.

1560
02:05:04,697 --> 02:05:06,527
I'm not like Halliday.

1561
02:05:10,202 --> 02:05:12,342
I'm taking the leap.

1562
02:05:28,721 --> 02:05:31,856
We're looking for Wade Watts.

1563
02:05:31,857 --> 02:05:34,127
We need you to make a statement
about the clip you sent in

1564
02:05:34,128 --> 02:05:36,326
of Nolan Sorrento's
confession.

1565
02:05:36,328 --> 02:05:39,058
Uh, that was me.

1566
02:05:39,064 --> 02:05:41,704
What? I record everything
in my workshop.

1567
02:05:48,040 --> 02:05:49,980
Help me out of this.

1568
02:05:56,248 --> 02:05:58,548
Who are you guys?

1569
02:05:58,551 --> 02:06:02,921
The people you need right now, lawyers.
From Gregarious Games.

1570
02:06:05,691 --> 02:06:07,391
They want
your signature, Wade.

1571
02:06:15,267 --> 02:06:17,336
I'm splitting it with my clan.

1572
02:06:17,337 --> 02:06:19,406
We're gonna
run things together.

1573
02:06:23,876 --> 02:06:26,076
That's a good choice.

1574
02:06:53,872 --> 02:06:57,482
F'Nale, listen to me
very carefully.

1575
02:07:06,118 --> 02:07:09,048
Mr. Morrow... I mean, Og,

1576
02:07:09,054 --> 02:07:10,555
how'd you get here so fast?

1577
02:07:10,556 --> 02:07:13,256
I flew from the stars
on my magic sleigh.

1578
02:07:13,258 --> 02:07:15,827
Everyone's been watching.

1579
02:07:15,828 --> 02:07:19,128
Of course, I've been watching
a little closer than most.

1580
02:07:23,102 --> 02:07:25,002
You?

1581
02:07:25,004 --> 02:07:26,314
You're the Curator?

1582
02:07:29,975 --> 02:07:33,444
Well played, Parzival.

1583
02:07:33,445 --> 02:07:35,475
Jim told me nothing
about the contest,

1584
02:07:35,481 --> 02:07:38,851
so there was no rule about me
losing a bet to a smart kid.

1585
02:07:38,852 --> 02:07:41,486
Not that you needed my help.

1586
02:07:41,487 --> 02:07:45,817
You figured out that Kira
was the key on your own.

1587
02:07:45,824 --> 02:07:48,534
Yeah, but...
Kira wasn't the key.

1588
02:07:49,795 --> 02:07:51,725
It was you, Mr. Morrow.

1589
02:07:53,799 --> 02:07:55,629
You were the Rosebud.

1590
02:07:55,634 --> 02:07:57,904
And Halliday's
biggest regret was

1591
02:07:59,538 --> 02:08:01,208
losing his only friend.

1592
02:08:05,377 --> 02:08:07,707
You know,
Jim used to say the OASIS

1593
02:08:07,713 --> 02:08:10,253
was never supposed to be
a one-player game.

1594
02:08:13,886 --> 02:08:16,686
Now, who do we have here?

1595
02:08:16,689 --> 02:08:19,357
Oh. Well, look who it is.

1596
02:08:19,358 --> 02:08:21,125
It's my heroes, the High Five.

1597
02:08:21,126 --> 02:08:22,925
- You must be Art3mis.
- Samantha.

1598
02:08:22,926 --> 02:08:24,725
The High Five
took over the OASIS,

1599
02:08:24,730 --> 02:08:26,630
and the first thing we did

1600
02:08:26,632 --> 02:08:29,872
was sign Ogden Morrow to
a non-exclusive consultancy.

1601
02:08:29,873 --> 02:08:32,868
The salary, per his demand,

1602
02:08:32,871 --> 02:08:36,141
was 25 cents. One quarter.

1603
02:08:39,344 --> 02:08:42,280
With his guidance,
our second move was to ban

1604
02:08:42,281 --> 02:08:45,498
any loyalty centers
from accessing the OASIS.

1605
02:08:45,499 --> 02:08:48,717
IOI had no choice.
They shut 'em all down.

1606
02:08:51,423 --> 02:08:54,425
The third thing we did
wasn't as popular.

1607
02:08:54,426 --> 02:08:58,426
We closed the OASIS
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

1608
02:08:58,430 --> 02:09:00,930
I know, it sounds
like a weird move,

1609
02:09:00,933 --> 02:09:03,903
but people need to spend
more time in the real world.

1610
02:09:05,504 --> 02:09:08,573
'Cause, like Halliday said,

1611
02:09:08,574 --> 02:09:12,984
reality is the only thing
that's real.
