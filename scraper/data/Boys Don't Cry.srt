1
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,724
- Shorter here.
- Shorter?

2
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,768
- Shorter.
- That is short enough.

3
00:01:45,835 --> 00:01:49,862
- Okay, superstar?
- Wow.

4
00:01:49,973 --> 00:01:52,305
What's with the shirt?

5
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,013
That is the most frightening
thing I've ever seen in my life.

6
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:08,251
- Looks like a deformity.
- I'll fix that.

7
00:02:10,727 --> 00:02:14,686
- Oh, God. Yeah.
- That's better.

8
00:02:14,764 --> 00:02:17,198
If you was a guy, I
might even wanna fuck you.

9
00:02:17,266 --> 00:02:20,724
You mean, if you was a guy
you might even wanna fuck me.

10
00:02:20,837 --> 00:02:24,068
So you're a boy? Now what?

11
00:02:25,742 --> 00:02:27,676
Come on.

12
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:31,840
No fuckin' way.

13
00:02:31,914 --> 00:02:34,678
Yes fuckin' way!

14
00:02:34,751 --> 00:02:37,015
- A joke is a joke. Now, come on.
- Don't be a pussy! Ow!

15
00:02:37,086 --> 00:02:39,179
I'm no fuckin' pussy. Let's go home.

16
00:02:39,255 --> 00:02:41,223
Someone's inside.

17
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,349
You've got a date?

18
00:02:43,426 --> 00:02:45,189
I gotta go!

19
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:48,597
Come here!

20
00:02:48,665 --> 00:02:50,758
Can I talk to you just for a minute?

21
00:02:55,004 --> 00:02:58,906
You look like a fuckin'
idiot in that hat.

22
00:02:58,975 --> 00:03:01,944
I'll be back. I'll be back.

23
00:03:02,011 --> 00:03:03,911
Teena.

24
00:03:27,804 --> 00:03:31,262
#I don't mind you hanging out #

25
00:03:31,374 --> 00:03:34,400
# Or talking in your sleep #

26
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,877
Yeah, athletic's nice.

27
00:03:37,947 --> 00:03:42,008
But the thing is he's sweet.
And good hair. That's important.

28
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:52,919
I'm Billy. Are, are you Nicole?

29
00:03:54,564 --> 00:03:58,523
# Or talking in your sleep #

30
00:03:58,601 --> 00:04:02,162
#I guess you're just what I needed #

31
00:04:02,271 --> 00:04:04,603
#I needed someone to bleed #

32
00:04:04,674 --> 00:04:09,168
You don't seem like
you're from around here.

33
00:04:09,245 --> 00:04:12,510
Where, where do I seem like I'm from?

34
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:16,785
Someplace beautiful.

35
00:04:29,265 --> 00:04:31,756
Okay. Hey.

36
00:04:31,868 --> 00:04:35,463
I'm gonna stand right here
until you're safe inside. Okay?

37
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:37,505
Okay.

38
00:04:50,953 --> 00:04:54,218
# You're just what I needed #

39
00:04:58,361 --> 00:05:01,296
# You're just what I needed #

40
00:05:05,902 --> 00:05:10,896
# You're just what I needed, yeah #

41
00:05:21,651 --> 00:05:25,212
You're not goin' anywhere! Fucker!

42
00:05:25,288 --> 00:05:29,725
- Get back here, you fucker!
- Scumbag!

43
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:34,924
You fuckin' dyke! You freak!

44
00:05:34,997 --> 00:05:38,330
You fucked my sister! Open the
fuckin' door, you fuckin' faggot!

45
00:05:38,401 --> 00:05:41,564
Open the fuckin' door! Fuck you!

46
00:05:41,671 --> 00:05:44,765
- You fuckin' asshole!
- Brothers.

47
00:05:44,874 --> 00:05:47,707
- Alicia.
- Alicia? Who is Alicia?

48
00:05:47,777 --> 00:05:51,076
- Damn! There's a lot of 'em!
- What the fuck have you done?

49
00:05:51,147 --> 00:05:54,275
I'll get your fuckin'
faggot cousin, too!

50
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:58,286
- What is the matter with you?
- I don't know! I don't know what went wrong.

51
00:05:58,354 --> 00:06:01,915
You are not a boy! That is what
went wrong! You are not a boy!

52
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:04,425
Tell them that. They say I'm
the best boyfriend they ever had.

53
00:06:04,493 --> 00:06:08,293
Do you want your mother to lock
you up again? Is that what you want?

54
00:06:08,364 --> 00:06:10,764
No.

55
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:15,361
- Then why don't you admit that you're a dyke?
- Because I'm not a dyke.

56
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:18,872
Fucker!

57
00:06:18,941 --> 00:06:22,536
- Fuck. What are you doin'?
- The money you owe me.

58
00:06:22,612 --> 00:06:26,810
- Get out of my fuckin' pants.
- I want it back. All of it.

59
00:06:26,883 --> 00:06:30,046
Jesus Christ! Careful with
that. You didn't have to do that.

60
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:34,488
You're not crashing here anymore,
Teena! Get your stuff and go!

61
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:59,544
# Why
are you hangin' 'round my door #

62
00:06:59,615 --> 00:07:05,053
#Never felt so lonely before #

63
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:09,353
#Faded on my heart #

64
00:07:09,425 --> 00:07:11,985
Bad night?

65
00:07:13,863 --> 00:07:15,797
The worst.

66
00:07:20,303 --> 00:07:24,330
#Now I know what it's like to cry #

67
00:07:25,508 --> 00:07:30,946
# What it's like to want to die #

68
00:07:32,682 --> 00:07:36,709
- What's your name?
- Candace.

69
00:07:38,187 --> 00:07:40,451
I hate it, though. I'm
thinking of changing it.

70
00:07:40,523 --> 00:07:43,515
Sometimes that helps.

71
00:07:43,592 --> 00:07:45,526
I'm Brandon.

72
00:07:52,468 --> 00:07:55,665
I'll pay if you get 'em.

73
00:07:55,771 --> 00:07:58,604
- Sure.
- Marlboros.

74
00:07:58,674 --> 00:08:01,268
I'll be right back.

75
00:08:01,344 --> 00:08:05,804
#Is a new shade of blue #

76
00:08:09,452 --> 00:08:12,444
Check this out.

77
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:16,321
- My friend's sitting there.
- So?

78
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,194
I said get off.

79
00:08:20,262 --> 00:08:23,823
Excuse me. Why don't you leave the
lady alone? I don't want any trouble.

80
00:08:28,637 --> 00:08:31,037
You've gotta be kidding me.

81
00:08:31,107 --> 00:08:34,338
I didn't ask you what you
wanted, you little fag.

82
00:08:44,787 --> 00:08:48,587
You fucker! You motherfucker!

83
00:08:48,657 --> 00:08:53,560
- I'm gonna kick...
- Hold on. Can't I leave you without you getting us into deeper shit?

84
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:56,462
Fuck! I'm gonna get your ass!

85
00:08:59,568 --> 00:09:01,695
Come on, stud. You got us into this.

86
00:09:01,804 --> 00:09:04,068
Fucker!

87
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,573
Oh, shit! Go, John, go!

88
00:09:10,646 --> 00:09:13,547
Go, John. Go, John, go. Come on!

89
00:09:15,017 --> 00:09:19,681
Cops, man. They suck.

90
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,449
I would've had those guys if
you wouldn't have stopped me.

91
00:09:25,528 --> 00:09:27,223
Oh, my God.

92
00:09:27,296 --> 00:09:28,957
- What?
- John, look.

93
00:09:29,031 --> 00:09:33,058
Yeah, you're gonna have
a shiner in the morning.

94
00:09:33,169 --> 00:09:35,899
- I am?
- Yeah.

95
00:09:36,005 --> 00:09:38,030
Oh, shit!

96
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,576
- You got a light, man?
- Oh, yeah, here.

97
00:09:45,314 --> 00:09:47,805
Mmm.

98
00:09:47,883 --> 00:09:51,080
- You have got the tiniest hands. Yeah.
- No.

99
00:09:51,153 --> 00:09:54,850
They're big! Joe Louis had tiny hands.

100
00:09:54,924 --> 00:09:57,119
So? He didn't throw wild
punches without defence.

101
00:09:57,193 --> 00:10:00,993
If you're gonna get into fights over girls
like Candace, you've gotta learn a few moves.

102
00:10:03,933 --> 00:10:07,334
- Come on.
- Come on.

103
00:10:12,374 --> 00:10:15,366
- Hey, pussy!
- Fuck you, man!

104
00:10:15,478 --> 00:10:17,810
- Tom, this is Brandon.
- Hi.

105
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,546
John. We'll give you a ride home
as soon as we find the goddamn car!

106
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:27,555
Sorry. It's up here somewhere.
We're goin’ to a party. Wanna come?

107
00:10:27,623 --> 00:10:29,420
Candace.

108
00:10:29,492 --> 00:10:33,553
- It's 70 miles away.
- I don't care. The night is young.

109
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:37,258
And I am a mess, so...

110
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,894
John.

111
00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:44,366
Good.

112
00:11:03,058 --> 00:11:06,357
Are we there yet?

113
00:11:06,462 --> 00:11:11,764
Just up ahead, unless you wanna stop at
a roadhouse and get into another fight.

114
00:11:45,668 --> 00:11:50,162
I don't know where the fuck I am.

115
00:11:52,241 --> 00:11:55,176
Falls City?

116
00:11:55,244 --> 00:11:58,771
What are you doin’ down there?
That's not even on the map.

117
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:02,681
Oh, fuck. Lonny, my life
is a fuckin' nightmare.

118
00:12:02,751 --> 00:12:07,711
I got this big court date next week,
and I don't got anywhere to stay.

119
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:12,056
If I don't make it, I'm
fucked. Can I stay at your house?

120
00:12:12,127 --> 00:12:14,391
- What about those doctors?
- I went.

121
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:18,797
That shit's insane! You gotta see
shrinks, shoot hormones up your butt.

122
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:23,463
It costs a fuckin' fortune. I'm gonna be an
old man by the time I get that kind of money.

123
00:12:23,572 --> 00:12:29,101
Do something. You can't just keep running
because... you're gonna end up in jail.

124
00:12:29,178 --> 00:12:31,339
Forever.

125
00:12:33,716 --> 00:12:37,812
- You really think I can do it?
- You're the butch.

126
00:12:37,886 --> 00:12:39,820
Come straight to my house.

127
00:12:39,888 --> 00:12:45,155
No stopping in bars, no
stealing and no more girls.

128
00:12:45,227 --> 00:12:49,687
No more girls. No more girls.

129
00:12:49,765 --> 00:12:54,725
- Hey, handsome. Sleep all right?
- Yeah.

130
00:12:54,803 --> 00:12:56,737
Candace.

131
00:12:56,805 --> 00:12:59,399
I remember.

132
00:12:59,508 --> 00:13:02,443
- This is Cody.
- Cody.

133
00:13:02,511 --> 00:13:04,172
Wow. Beautiful.

134
00:13:04,246 --> 00:13:06,612
You still brooding over your fiancée?

135
00:13:06,682 --> 00:13:11,847
What? Oh. It's a real,
real long story. Hey, hey.

136
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,650
God, you're really good with kids.

137
00:13:14,723 --> 00:13:17,317
Yeah. I got one of my own.

138
00:13:26,302 --> 00:13:28,361
Hey, Brandon!

139
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:32,406
Good news. I got you a ride.

140
00:13:32,508 --> 00:13:35,204
- All right.
- He's goin’ to Lincoln later tonight.

141
00:13:35,277 --> 00:13:37,177
Wow.

142
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:41,376
Cool.

143
00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:03,201
You suck.

144
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:07,106
Ah, hey, champ! You
headin' home tonight?

145
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:09,734
Tom only dates girls that got
a little butt and a long crack.

146
00:14:09,778 --> 00:14:13,236
You know what I mean?
That's how he picks 'em.

147
00:14:15,184 --> 00:14:17,414
Tom likes 'em coyote
ugly. You know coyote ugly?

148
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:20,853
I'm all over some booty.

149
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,924
Thank you.

150
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:29,730
Looks like you're ridin'
home with Ted Bundy.

151
00:14:29,798 --> 00:14:33,063
Shut up, John! He looks fine, right?

152
00:14:33,168 --> 00:14:36,604
- Just like family.
- Speaking of.

153
00:14:36,705 --> 00:14:40,004
- Where's Lana?
- We were gonna go on, but she wandered off.

154
00:14:40,075 --> 00:14:43,306
You got some time to
stick around, right?

155
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:44,676
If these girls get their shit
together, they're gonna do some karaoke.

156
00:14:44,747 --> 00:14:46,840
If these girls get their shit
together, they're gonna do some karaoke.

157
00:14:50,486 --> 00:14:53,978
Lana! Where you been?

158
00:14:54,056 --> 00:14:59,517
Come on, Lana. Let's go on,
already. It was your idea.

159
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:07,794
Who are you?

160
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:23,476
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

161
00:15:45,674 --> 00:15:51,544
# The lonesome Texas
sun was setting slow #

162
00:15:53,982 --> 00:15:59,215
#And in the rearview
mirror I watched it go #

163
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,623
Shut the fuck up!

164
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:09,153
#In her golden hair #

165
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:13,292
# I close my eyes for a moment #

166
00:16:13,368 --> 00:16:16,860
# I'm still there #

167
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,308
#The bluest eyes in Texas #

168
00:16:22,377 --> 00:16:25,505
#Are haunting me tonight #

169
00:16:28,951 --> 00:16:31,920
#Another town #

170
00:16:31,987 --> 00:16:35,252
#Another hotel room #

171
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:43,159
#Another dream that ended way too soon #

172
00:16:45,434 --> 00:16:47,698
# Left me lonely #

173
00:16:47,803 --> 00:16:51,295
#Praying for the dawn #

174
00:16:54,510 --> 00:17:00,881
# Searching for the
strength to carry on #

175
00:17:02,651 --> 00:17:06,519
#The bluest eyes in Texas #

176
00:17:06,622 --> 00:17:09,523
#Are haunting me tonight #

177
00:17:20,235 --> 00:17:23,693
- Come on.
- Whoo!

178
00:17:28,644 --> 00:17:32,410
What the fuckin' fuck? I thought
you were gonna be like five minutes!

179
00:17:32,481 --> 00:17:34,415
We got stuck...

180
00:17:34,483 --> 00:17:37,384
- in time warp.
- Get in the car already.

181
00:17:45,594 --> 00:17:47,619
Hey, Brandon.

182
00:17:47,696 --> 00:17:50,164
- Come with us. - He's
a psycho-killer anyway.

183
00:17:50,232 --> 00:17:52,132
Crash with me again.

184
00:17:54,603 --> 00:17:57,037
Come on, buddy.

185
00:17:58,073 --> 00:18:00,633
Whoo-hoo!

186
00:18:11,687 --> 00:18:14,588
Like I was saying,
when I get to the house,

187
00:18:14,656 --> 00:18:17,386
my sister was totally naked
and totally on fire, right?

188
00:18:17,459 --> 00:18:20,155
Oh, yeah. Tom was like
"Where's my camera?" Right?

189
00:18:20,228 --> 00:18:22,162
You saved everyone?

190
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,394
Oh, yeah. Tom's a big hero. He
rescued everybody. Right, dickwad?

191
00:18:26,468 --> 00:18:28,595
Yeah, so when they brought
me in, they were like,

192
00:18:28,704 --> 00:18:33,573
"This is the biggest fire we seen
here in 50 years. You're a hero, man."

193
00:18:33,642 --> 00:18:35,576
I was like, "Yeah?"
They were like, "Yeah."

194
00:18:35,644 --> 00:18:38,613
That's why they put me in
all of ‘em Lincoln newspapers.

195
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,648
- Probably seen 'em. That was me.
- That's cool.

196
00:18:40,716 --> 00:18:45,153
- What the hell is that?
- Bumper skiing.

197
00:18:46,421 --> 00:18:48,184
Thank you.

198
00:18:50,258 --> 00:18:53,227
Flippinburgers.

199
00:18:53,295 --> 00:18:57,254
That's for squares, man. I mean, give
me real work like in the oil fields.

200
00:18:57,332 --> 00:19:01,200
I was thinkin' about becoming a smoke
jumper out in Mount Saint Helens.

201
00:19:01,303 --> 00:19:04,795
Fightin' fires, makin' lots of money.

202
00:19:04,906 --> 00:19:09,536
- Then traveling all around. Memphis, Graceland, Tennessee.
- You dick.

203
00:19:09,611 --> 00:19:14,139
Graceland is in Memphis. And Memphis is in Tennessee.

204
00:19:14,216 --> 00:19:16,548
I know.

205
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,657
- Maybe you've had enough.
- I ain't had any.

206
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:26,990
No shit, man. People
like you don't need drugs.

207
00:19:27,062 --> 00:19:30,498
You just hallucinate 24 hours a day.

208
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,530
Oh, shit!

209
00:19:40,142 --> 00:19:42,872
All right, Tom, you're up.

210
00:19:42,944 --> 00:19:45,276
Not me, man. I'm drinking.

211
00:19:45,347 --> 00:19:48,544
All right, Brandon,
that means you. Come on.

212
00:19:48,617 --> 00:19:52,109
- Yeah, stud. Let's go, cowboy.
- Come on, you can do it.

213
00:19:52,187 --> 00:19:56,021
Come on. Come on.

214
00:19:56,091 --> 00:19:57,854
This here's Brandon.

215
00:19:57,926 --> 00:20:00,690
A mean prizefighter from Lincoln,
so be careful what you say to him.

216
00:20:00,762 --> 00:20:02,696
Very tough.

217
00:20:02,764 --> 00:20:04,891
Don't let 'em scare you. You can do it.

218
00:20:23,885 --> 00:20:26,183
He is a freak.

219
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,522
Come on!

220
00:20:35,197 --> 00:20:37,688
You can do better than that!

221
00:20:42,104 --> 00:20:46,268
- One more time. One more time.
- John, come on. Stop it, John.

222
00:20:46,374 --> 00:20:49,571
- Oh, okay, okay.
- Stop it!

223
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,812
Ow!

224
00:20:53,882 --> 00:20:56,112
- Take it easy.
- No, I'm fine.

225
00:20:56,184 --> 00:20:58,209
- Yeah, you're fine.
- I'm fine!

226
00:20:58,286 --> 00:21:02,450
- Bring that truck back around!
- You're a crazy fucker. What are we gonna do with you?

227
00:21:02,524 --> 00:21:04,992
- Man, it's nothing.
- Yeah, it's nothing.

228
00:21:05,093 --> 00:21:08,028
Wait, where are
you going? I'll drive!

229
00:21:08,063 --> 00:21:10,497
You don't have a car.

230
00:22:32,314 --> 00:22:37,251
# There's
a diamond in her eye #

231
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:41,779
#It's a-shining up above #

232
00:22:43,758 --> 00:22:48,127
#And the moon in the sky #

233
00:22:48,196 --> 00:22:52,656
#Say you won't tell why #

234
00:22:59,441 --> 00:23:03,172
# We're gamblers that tell you lies #

235
00:23:03,245 --> 00:23:08,547
#Should take a tumble and never lose #

236
00:23:10,552 --> 00:23:12,713
#In the morning #

237
00:23:12,787 --> 00:23:17,224
#She wears a smile
She's made of stone #

238
00:23:17,292 --> 00:23:19,192
Oh, hey.

239
00:23:19,261 --> 00:23:24,062
Ah, you sell... Ruffles?

240
00:23:24,132 --> 00:23:26,532
Ruffles. Right over there.

241
00:23:26,601 --> 00:23:29,092
Thank you.

242
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:44,517
Dream on, Lana.

243
00:23:44,586 --> 00:23:47,987
- I can't be selling you no beer tonight.
- Fine, I'll browse.

244
00:23:50,725 --> 00:23:54,661
The beer's in the back if you want it.

245
00:24:01,603 --> 00:24:03,730
Oh.

246
00:24:03,838 --> 00:24:06,602
- Hey.
- Space cowboy.

247
00:24:09,477 --> 00:24:13,038
I'm so wasted. I don't know
if I'm ever gonna come down.

248
00:24:13,114 --> 00:24:15,412
- That's okay.
- I need beer.

249
00:24:15,483 --> 00:24:18,452
Come here. Shh. Come here.

250
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,854
It's okay. It's okay. Stay right here.

251
00:24:25,193 --> 00:24:28,594
It's okay. Here, um... it's for me.

252
00:24:28,663 --> 00:24:30,688
- Can I see some I.D.?
- Sure.

253
00:24:30,765 --> 00:24:33,233
Oh, look how beautiful.

254
00:24:33,301 --> 00:24:37,965
Jesus Christ! I feel like I'm on
acid. It's like an album cover.

255
00:24:39,307 --> 00:24:43,243
You care to join me?

256
00:24:43,311 --> 00:24:45,404
- Come on.
- Fuck off!

257
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,677
- Hey, hey.
- Don't talk to me like that, you skanky little snake!

258
00:24:52,187 --> 00:24:54,587
Kwik Stop.

259
00:24:56,491 --> 00:25:00,621
Hey, Lana! Lana, wait.

260
00:25:00,695 --> 00:25:03,892
- I'll drive you. I got Candace's car.
- I'm walkin'.

261
00:25:03,965 --> 00:25:06,024
Here.

262
00:25:08,503 --> 00:25:11,370
What are you still hanging
around here for anyway?

263
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:15,569
I thought someone ought to walk you home
before you get an M.I.P. Or somethin'.

264
00:25:15,643 --> 00:25:19,101
I don't need anybody
to walk me anywhere.

265
00:25:21,016 --> 00:25:24,577
- Jeez, watch it.
- I don't need you to stop me from trippin'.

266
00:25:24,652 --> 00:25:27,815
Lana, you are one cranky girl.

267
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:31,325
You'd be cranky too, " Mr. I'm Going
To Memphis-Graceland-Tennessee,"

268
00:25:31,393 --> 00:25:36,057
if you were stuck in a town where there's
nothing to do but bumper skiing and chase bats...

269
00:25:36,131 --> 00:25:38,122
every night of your evil fuckin'g life.

270
00:25:38,199 --> 00:25:41,464
I been bored my whole life.

271
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:46,700
Yeah? Is that why you let John tie you
up to the truck and drag you like a dog?

272
00:25:46,808 --> 00:25:50,801
No. I just thought that's
what guys do around here.

273
00:25:55,283 --> 00:25:59,617
Wait a minute. What's your name again?

274
00:25:59,687 --> 00:26:02,178
Brandon.

275
00:26:04,993 --> 00:26:09,020
The disks took off from here.

276
00:26:09,097 --> 00:26:12,396
That's all
there is. Let's go back.

277
00:26:14,102 --> 00:26:16,536
Lana?

278
00:26:16,604 --> 00:26:18,572
Lana?

279
00:26:19,674 --> 00:26:22,108
Just go on home, okay?

280
00:26:25,213 --> 00:26:27,579
God, I hate my life.

281
00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:30,174
Lana!

282
00:26:30,251 --> 00:26:32,685
I hate your life too.

283
00:26:32,754 --> 00:26:35,689
Don't look at my stupid house.

284
00:26:35,757 --> 00:26:39,818
I'm not looking at your stupid
house. I'm looking at you.

285
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,264
What was I thinking?

286
00:26:51,806 --> 00:26:55,207
Mom? Come on.

287
00:26:55,276 --> 00:26:57,938
Come on.

288
00:26:58,012 --> 00:27:00,503
- Did you
eat? - Uh-uh.

289
00:27:00,582 --> 00:27:03,312
- Upsy. Oh.
- Oh, dear.

290
00:27:03,384 --> 00:27:06,615
- It's all right.
- Okay.

291
00:27:08,156 --> 00:27:10,647
Don't. It's okay.

292
00:27:15,497 --> 00:27:20,332
Hi. Here, drink this. You'll
feel better in the morning.

293
00:27:20,401 --> 00:27:22,528
Come on.

294
00:27:24,506 --> 00:27:26,474
Oh, here.

295
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:37,176
Yuck.

296
00:27:37,252 --> 00:27:39,277
It's good for ya.

297
00:27:40,755 --> 00:27:43,417
I got a thing for cow.

298
00:27:43,491 --> 00:27:46,153
I know a song about cows.

299
00:27:46,227 --> 00:27:48,218
My dad taught it to me.

300
00:27:48,296 --> 00:27:50,560
You're not gonna sing
it for me, are you?

301
00:27:50,632 --> 00:27:54,090
No. I can't
sing to save my life.

302
00:27:54,169 --> 00:27:57,627
- Me neither.
- What?

303
00:27:57,705 --> 00:27:59,400
Sure you can. You sing great.

304
00:27:59,507 --> 00:28:02,567
That wasn't me. It was karaoke.

305
00:28:02,677 --> 00:28:07,137
So? You were still great.

306
00:28:07,248 --> 00:28:09,182
I couldn't do it.

307
00:28:09,217 --> 00:28:12,050
A lot of people I know couldn't.

308
00:28:49,924 --> 00:28:53,087
You don't know any songs about cows.

309
00:28:54,796 --> 00:28:57,026
Sure, I do.

310
00:29:08,843 --> 00:29:11,937
Comin' to
you this beautiful Friday, October 27.

311
00:29:12,013 --> 00:29:14,538
This is "Corn Report."

312
00:29:14,616 --> 00:29:16,709
It is 8.00 a.m. It's 45 degrees.

313
00:29:16,784 --> 00:29:20,447
You better watch out.
That winter is coming.

314
00:29:24,092 --> 00:29:26,117
Hey.

315
00:29:26,194 --> 00:29:28,492
Is it always this nice
here in the morning?

316
00:29:28,563 --> 00:29:30,758
I made you a little breakfast.

317
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:34,498
Wow.

318
00:29:35,737 --> 00:29:38,797
Thank you.

319
00:29:45,046 --> 00:29:47,708
My hand sucks.

320
00:29:47,782 --> 00:29:50,216
How come Aunt Lana's asleep?

321
00:29:50,285 --> 00:29:53,721
Your Aunt Lana, she is a nice
girl, but she is as lazy...

322
00:29:53,788 --> 00:29:55,813
as the day is long.

323
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:58,188
Don't you be like that. Okay? Huh?

324
00:29:58,259 --> 00:30:01,228
April, you answer somebody
when they ask you a question.

325
00:30:01,296 --> 00:30:05,164
- How are things goin’ with her mother?
- She gave me April for a couple days.

326
00:30:05,233 --> 00:30:10,330
- # Who's that lady #
- I love this song! Yes!

327
00:30:10,438 --> 00:30:13,874
- # Who's that lady #
- # Who's that lady #

328
00:30:13,941 --> 00:30:18,708
- # Who's that lady Beautiful lady #
- #A real, real fine lady #

329
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:23,547
#I wish somebody would
introduce her to me #

330
00:30:23,618 --> 00:30:26,849
Come on, get up. Dance with me. Come on.

331
00:30:26,921 --> 00:30:29,389
Get up.

332
00:30:29,457 --> 00:30:32,824
#I asked her to dance #

333
00:30:32,894 --> 00:30:35,328
#It was love at first sight #

334
00:30:35,396 --> 00:30:38,923
April? Come here.

335
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,266
Jesus! Would you turn down the
goddamn music? I'm trying to sleep!

336
00:30:43,371 --> 00:30:45,635
Whoo, yeah!

337
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,436
- Come on, honey, loosen up.
- No, let me go.

338
00:30:48,543 --> 00:30:50,670
Let me go! Let me go!

339
00:30:50,745 --> 00:30:54,772
You motherfuckers! Why'd they
ever let you fuckheads out of jail?

340
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:22,733
#L.A. Is crazy #

341
00:31:22,844 --> 00:31:25,813
#I got a shake in my head #

342
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:30,783
#I feel like I'm dying
And I wish I was dead #

343
00:31:30,852 --> 00:31:35,846
#If I live till tomorrow
that'll be a long time #

344
00:31:35,923 --> 00:31:41,088
#I'll reel and I'll fall
but I'll rise on Codeine #

345
00:31:42,597 --> 00:31:45,623
# You'll forget you're a woman #

346
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,100
# You'll forget about men #

347
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:53,368
# Try it just once and
you'll try it again #

348
00:31:53,474 --> 00:31:57,672
# You'll forget about life
You'll forget about time #

349
00:31:57,745 --> 00:32:03,911
#And live all your days
a slave to Codeine #

350
00:32:03,985 --> 00:32:07,887
#It's real Lord, it's real #

351
00:32:07,955 --> 00:32:11,288
# One more time #

352
00:32:14,195 --> 00:32:18,359
#And some of them fall #

353
00:32:18,433 --> 00:32:21,459
# To rise on Codeine #

354
00:32:25,873 --> 00:32:27,864
I'm an asshole.

355
00:32:28,109 --> 00:32:30,304
Uh-oh.

356
00:32:30,378 --> 00:32:33,006
- What?
- Blowout.

357
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,913
- What happened?
- I'm in the doghouse again, you know what I mean?

358
00:32:35,983 --> 00:32:38,679
- I've been there my whole life.
- Women, right?

359
00:32:38,753 --> 00:32:41,381
Yeah.

360
00:32:41,456 --> 00:32:43,390
Mmm. You gonna do a
little damage control?

361
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:47,224
- Then you're gonna fuck it up all over again.
- Yep. Come on.

362
00:32:47,295 --> 00:32:50,696
Oh, my goodness!

363
00:32:50,765 --> 00:32:53,529
- Hey, who are you? What's your name, huh?
- April.

364
00:32:53,601 --> 00:32:56,695
April? How'd you get such a pretty name?

365
00:32:56,804 --> 00:33:00,706
- My daddy.
- Yeah, that's true. I named her.

366
00:33:00,775 --> 00:33:02,709
- Where you goin’?
- See Grandma.

367
00:33:02,777 --> 00:33:04,574
All right, go on.

368
00:33:07,715 --> 00:33:10,809
- Got an extra
cig, man? - Mm-hmm.

369
00:33:11,886 --> 00:33:13,649
Thanks, man.

370
00:33:13,721 --> 00:33:17,157
Is she, um, Lana's?

371
00:33:17,225 --> 00:33:19,523
Lana's? No.

372
00:33:19,594 --> 00:33:24,327
No. I had April with a
different girl. Mallory.

373
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:29,028
This here's my real family, even
if it isn't my real home. You know?

374
00:33:29,136 --> 00:33:31,366
I mean, uh...

375
00:33:31,472 --> 00:33:34,908
Lana... I don't know.

376
00:33:35,009 --> 00:33:38,035
It's kinda hard to explain.

377
00:33:38,145 --> 00:33:42,104
Well, I got 12 more like this at home.

378
00:33:42,183 --> 00:33:44,117
I keep it in a secret place.

379
00:33:44,185 --> 00:33:46,983
She wrote to me when I was in lockup.

380
00:33:47,054 --> 00:33:49,989
Lana did?

381
00:33:50,057 --> 00:33:55,120
Yep. She wrote to me. Even my own
mom didn't write to me, but she did.

382
00:33:55,196 --> 00:33:58,757
Lana and her mom. They took me in.

383
00:34:01,836 --> 00:34:03,736
Fuck. Fucker.

384
00:34:03,838 --> 00:34:08,275
- Brandon, honey, where'd you say your folks are from?
- I'm from Lincoln.

385
00:34:08,309 --> 00:34:12,245
But my dad's out in...
in Memphis right now.

386
00:34:12,313 --> 00:34:14,372
And my mom's in Hollywood.

387
00:34:14,448 --> 00:34:16,746
- Hollywood? Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

388
00:34:16,817 --> 00:34:20,810
- Yeah, my sister is a model.
- That's glamorous.

389
00:34:20,888 --> 00:34:23,550
Brandon, while you're up, why don't
you clean these ashtrays for us?

390
00:34:23,624 --> 00:34:25,558
- Fuck you.
- Just playin' with you, bud.

391
00:34:26,994 --> 00:34:30,725
Brandon, come here. Over here.

392
00:34:30,798 --> 00:34:35,235
Closer where I can see you. Let me
look at you in the light. Come on.

393
00:34:37,905 --> 00:34:40,874
Come here. Let me.

394
00:34:42,743 --> 00:34:45,610
I can believe you got
a model for a sister.

395
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,649
You're like a little
movie star yourself.

396
00:34:57,058 --> 00:34:59,049
Hey, April?

397
00:34:59,126 --> 00:35:01,856
- Want a beer?
- Hey!

398
00:35:01,929 --> 00:35:04,227
What the fuck are you doing?

399
00:35:04,332 --> 00:35:07,301
Here you go, hon. Have some of Dad's.

400
00:35:07,335 --> 00:35:10,099
Come on. Come on. Little bit.

401
00:35:10,204 --> 00:35:14,664
Four years ago, you wouldn't have thought he
could take care of himself, let alone that kid.

402
00:35:14,775 --> 00:35:20,042
Shit, four years ago you wouldn't
have been able to talk to him.

403
00:35:20,114 --> 00:35:24,813
Prison. Mm-hmm. And her mother!

404
00:35:24,885 --> 00:35:27,445
Jesus Christ!

405
00:35:27,521 --> 00:35:31,116
And this one, this one kept
that boy's spirit alive.

406
00:35:32,793 --> 00:35:35,694
Would you just forget about that?

407
00:35:37,732 --> 00:35:41,725
The bastard pissed on me! This never would've
happened if she had the proper training.

408
00:35:41,802 --> 00:35:44,828
- Your mother's an asshole!
- John, she had an accident.

409
00:35:46,674 --> 00:35:50,405
It's okay,
sweetie. It's not your fault.

410
00:35:53,681 --> 00:35:55,706
Having fun?

411
00:35:55,783 --> 00:35:58,479
Yeah.

412
00:35:58,552 --> 00:36:01,180
What do you think of my
mom? She's pretty weird, huh?

413
00:36:01,255 --> 00:36:04,190
No, I like her. You
know, I think she's funny.

414
00:36:04,258 --> 00:36:06,123
Are you for real?

415
00:36:06,193 --> 00:36:08,923
Excuse me. Am I interrupting something?

416
00:36:08,996 --> 00:36:12,329
Brandon, I want you to take a picture of
me and my daughter. Lana's dad gave us that.

417
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,732
I don't feel like having
my picture taken now.

418
00:36:14,802 --> 00:36:18,465
Come on, honey. Just one. Come on, son.

419
00:36:18,572 --> 00:36:20,563
Hey!

420
00:36:20,675 --> 00:36:23,200
Well, refill time.

421
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,540
Bring it in when you're ready, okay?

422
00:36:25,613 --> 00:36:27,638
Okay.

423
00:36:32,953 --> 00:36:35,285
Here, look. It's not bad, huh?

424
00:36:35,356 --> 00:36:38,519
- Oh!
- What?

425
00:36:39,694 --> 00:36:42,788
- No!
- Why not? You're beautiful.

426
00:36:42,863 --> 00:36:45,423
Come over here.

427
00:36:54,975 --> 00:36:57,967
I had a dream about you last night.

428
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,140
You did? What happened?

429
00:37:02,216 --> 00:37:04,343
- No!
- Come on, tell me the dream.

430
00:37:06,387 --> 00:37:09,151
Someone walked me home last night.

431
00:37:09,223 --> 00:37:11,214
I think it was you.

432
00:37:12,793 --> 00:37:14,852
No fair!

433
00:37:23,871 --> 00:37:26,635
Lana, time to go to work.

434
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:35,948
John, you're too fucked up.
Why don't you let Brandon drive?

435
00:37:37,318 --> 00:37:40,981
Hey, here you go, little buddy.

436
00:37:41,055 --> 00:37:43,683
You all right?

437
00:37:43,758 --> 00:37:45,988
Tom!

438
00:38:00,608 --> 00:38:02,838
Nice car.

439
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,969
Why don't you turn down your radio?

440
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:06,808
Yeah, totally!

441
00:38:08,716 --> 00:38:11,947
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Wall people.

442
00:38:12,019 --> 00:38:14,852
- What the fuck did you say?
- I said, "Wall people."

443
00:38:17,825 --> 00:38:20,794
- Bite me, you fuckin' fudgepacker!
- Eat me.

444
00:38:20,861 --> 00:38:22,795
Fuck you!

445
00:38:38,979 --> 00:38:40,344
Go!

446
00:38:40,414 --> 00:38:44,180
Come on, pussy! Go
faster, you cocksucker.

447
00:38:46,487 --> 00:38:48,751
Go, go, go!

448
00:38:48,823 --> 00:38:51,815
Bitches! Bitches!

449
00:38:55,396 --> 00:38:58,991
Whoo!

450
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:24,655
It's the man! Fuck!

451
00:39:24,725 --> 00:39:26,590
- It's the piggers.
- Oh, fuck.

452
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:29,424
He's catching up. What the fuck?

453
00:39:30,798 --> 00:39:33,665
- Fuck.
- Don't stop, don't stop. Go faster.

454
00:39:33,734 --> 00:39:35,258
Brandon.

455
00:39:35,336 --> 00:39:38,362
Go faster.

456
00:39:38,472 --> 00:39:40,099
Brandon, stop!

457
00:39:40,207 --> 00:39:43,608
They ain't got no fuckin' balls!

458
00:39:52,486 --> 00:39:54,647
When you hit the gravel, drop to 40.

459
00:40:08,035 --> 00:40:09,969
I can't see.

460
00:40:14,608 --> 00:40:18,601
That's okay. Neither
can he. You're flyin'.

461
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,707
Take it out.

462
00:41:01,522 --> 00:41:04,685
Get off me, Dave. I
wasn’t doing anything.

463
00:41:04,792 --> 00:41:07,590
Going awful fast back
there, Mr. Brayman.

464
00:41:07,628 --> 00:41:11,189
- Mind telling me what you're doing in Falls City?
- Just visiting, officer, sir.

465
00:41:11,265 --> 00:41:13,324
Where are you staying?

466
00:41:16,136 --> 00:41:18,570
He's staying with me.

467
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,505
I can't run a check on this, son,
'cause our computers are down.

468
00:41:28,582 --> 00:41:31,107
But I could run you all in right now.

469
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,756
You could let these guys go, huh, man?

470
00:41:36,824 --> 00:41:40,089
They ain't got anything to do
with it. I got carried away.

471
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,288
We don't got anything
like this in Lincoln.

472
00:41:43,364 --> 00:41:45,298
Dustless highways?

473
00:41:45,366 --> 00:41:48,460
Only one in Nebraska.
That's a 100 foot drop.

474
00:41:53,907 --> 00:41:56,341
- I'm not gonna lock you up, but you're gettin' a ticket.
- Okay.

475
00:41:56,410 --> 00:42:00,346
Those are residential streets
back there, so you slow down.

476
00:42:00,414 --> 00:42:03,247
- Do you read me, Mr. Brayman?
- Absolutely, sir.

477
00:42:03,317 --> 00:42:06,912
Let me see this I.D. That's
pretty slick. Charles Brayman.

478
00:42:07,021 --> 00:42:09,717
I let you down. I'm sorry.

479
00:42:09,757 --> 00:42:13,523
Man, don't worry about it. We'll take
you down to the tunnel, chase some bats.

480
00:42:13,594 --> 00:42:17,086
Yeah, it's like the tunnel of love.

481
00:42:17,164 --> 00:42:19,655
God, Candace, would you get a grip?

482
00:42:19,733 --> 00:42:23,567
- Is that your real birthday?
- No, November 10, '72.

483
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:26,764
Hey, that's next week.
Let's have a party.

484
00:42:26,874 --> 00:42:29,843
Twenty-one!
You're gonna be a man!

485
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:32,808
Shit.

486
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,781
Don't you never pull that shit again.

487
00:42:35,849 --> 00:42:38,283
What?

488
00:42:38,352 --> 00:42:41,412
You heard me. I said don't
never pull that shit again.

489
00:42:41,488 --> 00:42:43,581
You got me stopped by the fuckin' cops.

490
00:42:43,657 --> 00:42:49,095
Why, but you're the one who
told me to race after 'em.

491
00:42:49,163 --> 00:42:51,688
I had you in the clear
and you fucked up.

492
00:42:54,935 --> 00:42:57,369
John, it's over. Don't get upset.

493
00:43:00,908 --> 00:43:03,900
I'm not upset. You almost got us killed.

494
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,846
I almost got us killed?

495
00:43:09,917 --> 00:43:12,784
Whoo. Brandon.

496
00:43:12,853 --> 00:43:14,946
You're the one who led us 90
miles an hour into a cloud of dust,

497
00:43:15,022 --> 00:43:19,686
then shut your eyes when we were
about to go off some 400 foot ravine.

498
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,455
Fuck!

499
00:43:21,528 --> 00:43:24,292
Get out of my goddamn car!

500
00:43:24,364 --> 00:43:26,764
Get out of my motherfuckin'g car!

501
00:43:26,834 --> 00:43:29,667
Get out of my goddamn,
motherfuckin'g, shit-eating car!

502
00:43:29,736 --> 00:43:33,672
Get out of my goddamn,
motherfruckin; shit-eating car!

503
00:43:42,483 --> 00:43:44,451
- Not you!
- Fuck you!

504
00:43:44,518 --> 00:43:46,543
No, not you.

505
00:44:11,245 --> 00:44:15,443
Welcome to the psycho ward.

506
00:44:24,758 --> 00:44:28,421
Come on, Kate. He's taking us to work.

507
00:44:28,495 --> 00:44:31,396
You know, Tom set that fire hisself.

508
00:44:48,182 --> 00:44:50,844
That's my car!

509
00:44:54,588 --> 00:44:57,989
Doctors say he ain't
got no impulse control.

510
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,693
I'm the only one who
can control that fucker.

511
00:45:05,899 --> 00:45:09,426
Come on. We'll walk you home, Candace.

512
00:45:13,273 --> 00:45:15,605
You ever try this?

513
00:45:16,677 --> 00:45:18,907
Tom.

514
00:45:18,979 --> 00:45:22,142
Did you set your own
family’s house on fire?

515
00:45:27,154 --> 00:45:29,145
What about this?

516
00:45:29,223 --> 00:45:33,023
You ever do this?

517
00:45:35,495 --> 00:45:37,827
What the fuck, Tom?

518
00:45:39,099 --> 00:45:43,399
Some people punch holes in walls.

519
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:45,734
This helps snap me back into reality.

520
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:48,706
Gets a control of this thing
inside of me so I don't,

521
00:45:48,775 --> 00:45:51,505
you know, lash out at someone.

522
00:45:53,113 --> 00:45:57,243
Me and John used to do it to
ourselves all the time in lockup.

523
00:45:57,317 --> 00:45:59,444
I could always go deeper than him.

524
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:01,987
He's such a wuss.

525
00:46:08,495 --> 00:46:11,658
Try it.

526
00:46:19,106 --> 00:46:22,974
God, I guess I am a
pussy compared to you.

527
00:46:28,348 --> 00:46:32,182
I'm just
jokin' with you, man.

528
00:47:12,426 --> 00:47:14,223
Fuck.

529
00:47:15,629 --> 00:47:18,291
Fuck!

530
00:47:34,614 --> 00:47:37,014
Brandon. Hey.

531
00:47:37,084 --> 00:47:39,484
Lana.

532
00:47:39,553 --> 00:47:43,148
I'm so sorry. I just
had to see someone nice.

533
00:47:43,223 --> 00:47:45,555
I just got off work and I'm
having a nervous breakdown.

534
00:47:45,625 --> 00:47:47,684
Just a minute. I have to pee, okay?

535
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:57,136
God, I was scared to death
that Candace was gonna catch me.

536
00:47:57,204 --> 00:47:59,570
You know she's obsessed
with finding a husband.

537
00:47:59,673 --> 00:48:02,141
I'm positive you're
her favourite candidate.

538
00:48:02,242 --> 00:48:05,609
I can't believe you worked last
night. You must be exhausted.

539
00:48:05,712 --> 00:48:10,775
Me, neither. I do it all the time. You
don't have to be sober to weigh spinach.

540
00:48:12,686 --> 00:48:15,712
- Thanks for the coffee.
- Yeah.

541
00:48:18,792 --> 00:48:23,195
I'm crashing really hard, though.

542
00:48:23,263 --> 00:48:28,599
I, um, have to go back to Lincoln
to take care of some stuff.

543
00:48:30,203 --> 00:48:32,603
- You're really leaving?
- Yeah.

544
00:48:32,706 --> 00:48:36,972
Are you gonna see
your sister? The model.

545
00:48:37,043 --> 00:48:39,011
Yeah.

546
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:44,574
Oh. Nicole. She's pretty.
Is she gonna be there?

547
00:48:44,651 --> 00:48:46,983
Yeah.

548
00:48:47,053 --> 00:48:50,454
Now that she's married, we're
gonna be taking off any second.

549
00:48:52,692 --> 00:48:55,092
So,

550
00:48:55,162 --> 00:48:58,859
where are you going on
your big trip out of here?

551
00:48:58,932 --> 00:49:02,265
Oh, I don't know.

552
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:06,130
I guess it's not all worked out yet.

553
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:08,434
That's okay.

554
00:49:08,542 --> 00:49:11,238
Um,

555
00:49:11,344 --> 00:49:14,973
thanks for giving your
address to the cops.

556
00:49:16,082 --> 00:49:18,141
It was nothing.

557
00:49:26,359 --> 00:49:28,327
I might hitchhike.

558
00:49:28,395 --> 00:49:32,058
Really? I've never done that.

559
00:49:32,132 --> 00:49:34,191
Me, neither.

560
00:49:40,273 --> 00:49:43,174
Well...

561
00:49:43,243 --> 00:49:46,406
This might sound really stupid,

562
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:52,316
but do you think there's anywhere
I could make money doing karaoke?

563
00:49:52,385 --> 00:49:57,220
Why not? People make money
doing all sorts of things.

564
00:50:01,261 --> 00:50:04,697
Did you really write
letters to him in prison?

565
00:50:06,633 --> 00:50:09,864
Give me a break. I was 13 years old.

566
00:50:09,936 --> 00:50:12,166
Who told you that? My mom?

567
00:50:12,272 --> 00:50:14,672
He did.

568
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,291
You better go.

569
00:50:42,802 --> 00:50:45,327
Yeah, yeah.

570
00:50:51,845 --> 00:50:56,646
# That rusty
nail over our front door #

571
00:50:56,716 --> 00:51:01,813
#Is where I hung our tears in the rain #

572
00:51:01,888 --> 00:51:06,757
#I threw that horseshoe into the weeds #

573
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:11,490
# To see what luck can bring #

574
00:51:11,531 --> 00:51:16,468
# 'Cause you're in your
bed And I'm in mine #

575
00:51:16,536 --> 00:51:19,869
# On either side of town #

576
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:21,635
# On either side of town #

577
00:51:21,741 --> 00:51:26,235
#I think I might take a ride #

578
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:40,451
Please, please don't get mad.

579
00:51:40,527 --> 00:51:45,829
Um, one night. One night and I'm gone.

580
00:51:45,899 --> 00:51:50,336
They're not gonna
lock me up, are they?

581
00:51:50,403 --> 00:51:53,236
Teena, how the fuck do I
know what they're gonna do?

582
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:56,537
- I'm sick of watching you fuck up.
- But...

583
00:51:56,643 --> 00:51:59,134
But I'm not fuckin' up.
It is so good down there.

584
00:51:59,245 --> 00:52:04,182
In Falls City? They hang
faggots there. Did you know that?

585
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:07,048
You've never even been there. Look.

586
00:52:08,555 --> 00:52:11,456
Look. See, isn't she beautiful?

587
00:52:11,524 --> 00:52:14,357
If you like white trash.

588
00:52:14,427 --> 00:52:16,452
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

589
00:52:18,832 --> 00:52:21,300
Before or after your
sex change operation?

590
00:52:21,368 --> 00:52:25,566
- Before or after you tell her that you're a girl?
- Shut up!

591
00:52:25,672 --> 00:52:27,936
It's different. It's working.

592
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:31,374
No, I'm not gonna fuck it up this time.

593
00:52:33,913 --> 00:52:36,177
I hope they do lock you up tomorrow.

594
00:52:38,151 --> 00:52:43,714
Keith Pierce, for the crime of
spray painting and smashing 50 new cars,

595
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:47,282
you are sentenced to six months
at the juvenile detention center.

596
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,761
Teena Brandon.

597
00:52:52,332 --> 00:52:56,701
Teena Brandon.
Docket 7-2-3-9-1.

598
00:53:00,407 --> 00:53:05,310
Teena Brandon. Docket
7-2-3-9-1. Grand theft, auto.

599
00:53:56,663 --> 00:54:00,599
Lana.

600
00:54:00,667 --> 00:54:02,999
Down here.

601
00:54:03,069 --> 00:54:04,730
Brandon.

602
00:54:04,838 --> 00:54:07,329
- Where'd you get that?
- Nice hat.

603
00:54:12,979 --> 00:54:16,142
I gotta go. My break's almost over.

604
00:54:32,599 --> 00:54:35,591
It looks so different from the outside.

605
00:54:52,886 --> 00:54:55,354
You're so pretty.

606
00:55:25,285 --> 00:55:28,152
I feel like I'm in a trance.

607
00:55:31,724 --> 00:55:34,454
Am I goin' too fast?

608
00:57:08,421 --> 00:57:12,881
I cannot wear these.
They make me look fat.

609
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:15,860
Quit changing the
subject.

610
00:57:15,929 --> 00:57:18,363
I saved your ass at work.
Tell us what's goin’ on?

611
00:57:18,431 --> 00:57:21,696
Yeah, I bet Brandon
doesn't think you're frat.

612
00:57:21,768 --> 00:57:24,464
Nobody looks fat when
they're laying down.

613
00:57:24,537 --> 00:57:27,802
I knew it! I fuckin'g knew it!

614
00:57:30,643 --> 00:57:33,373
We just drove around taking pictures.

615
00:57:33,479 --> 00:57:36,209
Yeah, right.

616
00:57:56,536 --> 00:57:58,197
Ooh!

617
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:02,037
I cannot talk about
it. It's too intense.

618
00:58:02,141 --> 00:58:04,041
Come on, Lana.

619
00:58:04,143 --> 00:58:06,703
I can't take it.

620
00:58:53,559 --> 00:58:56,619
Are you okay?

621
00:58:56,696 --> 00:58:58,630
Yeah.

622
00:59:05,138 --> 00:59:08,972
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

623
00:59:09,075 --> 00:59:11,805
- What?
- I mean...

624
00:59:11,911 --> 00:59:14,379
I don't know.

625
00:59:42,909 --> 00:59:45,935
You're so handsome.

626
01:00:03,696 --> 01:00:06,859
And then we took off our
clothes and went swimmin'.

627
01:00:13,139 --> 01:00:16,302
Don't be scared, Brandon.

628
01:00:23,082 --> 01:00:27,212
- Did you do it?
- What do you think?

629
01:00:29,555 --> 01:00:32,922
Whoo!

630
01:00:44,203 --> 01:00:46,398
What'd you wish for?

631
01:00:46,472 --> 01:00:48,838
I know what he wished for. Yeah, baby!

632
01:00:48,941 --> 01:00:51,808
Oh, Mom! Don't talk so gross.

633
01:00:51,878 --> 01:00:55,837
I'm being fun.

634
01:00:55,948 --> 01:00:59,475
- Happy birthday.
- You shouldn't have, really.

635
01:01:06,659 --> 01:01:09,389
Keeping me strong, Mom?

636
01:01:09,462 --> 01:01:13,091
- Happy birthday, sweetheart.
- Thanks, Mom.

637
01:01:13,166 --> 01:01:14,997
Sorry, I forgot mine.

638
01:01:16,736 --> 01:01:20,069
- It's okay.
- I haven't wrapped mine yet.

639
01:01:22,208 --> 01:01:24,335
- Hey, grease monkey.
- How ya doin’?

640
01:01:24,443 --> 01:01:27,879
Man, we were doing a job in Omaha. We
could've used a lookout, right, John?

641
01:01:29,949 --> 01:01:34,181
John Lotter.

642
01:01:34,253 --> 01:01:37,950
I know your mother, and I know
she taught you how to knock.

643
01:01:38,024 --> 01:01:41,118
We could've been lying around
here naked, for all you know, baby.

644
01:01:41,194 --> 01:01:43,560
- Where's Lana?
- She's in her room.

645
01:01:43,629 --> 01:01:47,690
Come on, get a beer.
It's Brandon’s birthday.

646
01:01:47,767 --> 01:01:50,065
Sit with us.

647
01:01:57,105 --> 01:01:59,039
Hey, gorgeous.

648
01:01:59,107 --> 01:02:02,543
Walk right in, why don't ya?

649
01:02:02,644 --> 01:02:05,408
- Can't you see I'm busy fixing my hair?
- Your hair's beautiful.

650
01:02:05,514 --> 01:02:09,575
I love your hair.

651
01:02:09,618 --> 01:02:12,985
- I got this for you up in Omaha.
- Cool.

652
01:02:15,757 --> 01:02:19,716
Tom and I went up to, uh,
Lincoln for a couple of days.

653
01:02:19,795 --> 01:02:22,958
Stealing cars?

654
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:32,200
Came by the factory before we
left, and you weren't there.

655
01:02:32,307 --> 01:02:33,865
So?

656
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:40,977
Nice.

657
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:43,210
Nice.

658
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:49,046
- Don't get upset. I just wanna talk.
- About what?

659
01:02:49,124 --> 01:02:52,651
About you and Brandon. I'm
just looking out for you.

660
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:57,323
What are you talking
about? He's your friend too.

661
01:02:59,601 --> 01:03:03,503
- I miss you. I do.
- Stop it, John.

662
01:03:03,605 --> 01:03:07,371
- You give me the creeps. You're like a stalker.
- Fuck you.

663
01:03:10,479 --> 01:03:13,209
- No, no. Fuck you.
- John, I'm sorry.

664
01:03:13,281 --> 01:03:15,647
I just need some privacy right now.

665
01:03:15,717 --> 01:03:18,277
Yeah.

666
01:03:18,353 --> 01:03:20,913
You know, I just want to protect you.

667
01:03:20,989 --> 01:03:23,082
I know.

668
01:03:23,158 --> 01:03:27,322
No one's ever protected me like you.

669
01:03:32,634 --> 01:03:35,068
What do you see in him?

670
01:03:35,136 --> 01:03:39,129
I mean, I know he's nice and
everything, but he's kind of a wuss.

671
01:03:39,241 --> 01:03:43,974
I know he's no big he-man like you.
There's just something about him.

672
01:03:44,045 --> 01:03:46,707
Oh, yeah. "There's just
something about him.

673
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:49,648
- I don't know."
- Stop makin' fun of me!

674
01:03:52,087 --> 01:03:56,046
Lana, honey,
are you fuckin' him?

675
01:03:56,124 --> 01:04:00,288
- Goddamn it! It's none of your fuckin'g business.
- You are. You are.

676
01:04:00,362 --> 01:04:04,093
Excuse me. Did I interrupt something?

677
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:07,634
Lana, you okay?

678
01:04:09,204 --> 01:04:11,331
Don't even think about it, John.

679
01:04:11,439 --> 01:04:13,964
Mmm.

680
01:04:17,178 --> 01:04:19,146
John, let's hit the road.

681
01:04:19,214 --> 01:04:22,513
No. It's Brandon's birthday.

682
01:04:22,584 --> 01:04:25,985
She's beautiful, isn't she?

683
01:04:26,054 --> 01:04:29,785
Oh, man. I've known her since she was...

684
01:04:29,858 --> 01:04:32,691
like this high.

685
01:04:32,761 --> 01:04:36,356
I could tell you stories about her.

686
01:04:36,431 --> 01:04:38,956
You know what kind of stories?

687
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:44,297
She told me about you guys.

688
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:51,240
And I can't think of a better
guy to give Lana to than you.

689
01:04:51,313 --> 01:04:54,942
So, happy birthday!

690
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:56,950
Thanks, John.

691
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:04,558
Just one thing you gotta
remember, little man.

692
01:05:04,626 --> 01:05:07,117
This is my house.

693
01:05:10,599 --> 01:05:13,534
Come on, turn up the music!

694
01:05:13,602 --> 01:05:16,002
Turn up the music!

695
01:06:01,316 --> 01:06:03,876
- I quit.
- Quit what?

696
01:06:03,952 --> 01:06:07,080
My evil job.

697
01:06:07,155 --> 01:06:11,182
I've just been thinkin' and
thinkin’, "What am I doin' here?"

698
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:14,126
Then it came to me. I'll
go to Memphis with you.

699
01:06:14,195 --> 01:06:18,632
- Memphis?
- I've got it all figured out. You're right.

700
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:21,999
- I'll make money singing karaoke.
- Lana.

701
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:24,004
You'll manage me.

702
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:27,472
If I'm no good, then you'll sing
and I'll manage you. It's perfect.

703
01:06:31,079 --> 01:06:34,242
Nothing can go wrong if we're together.

704
01:06:34,315 --> 01:06:36,442
Lana, um...

705
01:06:36,518 --> 01:06:40,113
It's more complicated
than that. Memphis is far.

706
01:06:40,188 --> 01:06:43,919
It's 1,327 miles.

707
01:06:43,992 --> 01:06:45,926
Yeah.

708
01:06:45,994 --> 01:06:49,157
But, you know, I've been thinkin’.

709
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:54,759
We could just start our own trailer
park right here in Falls City.

710
01:06:54,836 --> 01:06:58,795
What, you
don't want to go with me?

711
01:06:58,907 --> 01:07:01,137
No! Of course I do.

712
01:07:01,209 --> 01:07:03,700
That's the point. I'll
marry you right now.

713
01:07:03,812 --> 01:07:07,407
Ooh, Lana.
You're in trouble again.

714
01:07:07,482 --> 01:07:10,918
Actually, that ain't Lana's, it's mine.

715
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:13,613
I'll take care of it.

716
01:07:13,688 --> 01:07:15,883
I just got my first paycheck.

717
01:07:15,957 --> 01:07:18,016
Come on, you go sit down.

718
01:07:18,093 --> 01:07:20,357
- Okay.
- I'll bring your breakfast right over to you.

719
01:07:20,428 --> 01:07:23,829
The thing
about the trailer park...

720
01:07:23,898 --> 01:07:27,390
is we'll have picnic tables,
people playing music...

721
01:07:27,469 --> 01:07:29,801
and barbecues every night.

722
01:07:29,904 --> 01:07:33,704
We'll invite our friends.
Candace, Kate, your mom.

723
01:07:33,775 --> 01:07:37,871
Heck, even John, if you two
don't kill each other first.

724
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:43,879
And best of all, we'll
have our own Airstream.

725
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:55,091
Ahem.

726
01:07:55,163 --> 01:07:58,030
If that's too much of a hassle, you
could mail that receipt to my house.

727
01:07:58,099 --> 01:08:01,865
That's all right. I'll just
be a moment. Um, be right back.

728
01:08:09,544 --> 01:08:13,002
Just one second. Okay? It's slow.

729
01:08:20,355 --> 01:08:22,880
Miss Brandon?

730
01:08:27,262 --> 01:08:31,892
Miss Brandon, we put your Charles Brayman
I.D. Number through the computer yesterday,

731
01:08:31,966 --> 01:08:37,233
and this is what the Lincoln
authorities faxed us over.

732
01:08:43,211 --> 01:08:45,179
You tell me.

733
01:08:47,315 --> 01:08:51,718
Wow. This Teena chick
seems pretty messed up.

734
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:57,724
What the hell is this?

735
01:09:00,395 --> 01:09:03,990
- Who wrote this?
- That guy who was staying with you.

736
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:07,431
Brandon.

737
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:56,539
Dear Lonny.
Bet you can't guess where I am.

738
01:09:56,618 --> 01:10:01,055
That's right. Back in
jail... in Falls City.

739
01:10:01,122 --> 01:10:04,649
I'm so tired of fuckin' up.
I'm trying to stay strong,

740
01:10:04,726 --> 01:10:07,661
but I don't know if I can face
all the mistakes I've made.

741
01:10:18,773 --> 01:10:20,707
I'm staying tough.

742
01:10:51,806 --> 01:10:55,298
Candace, why
do you look so funny?

743
01:11:10,525 --> 01:11:15,724
Lana! Lana, what are you doing here?

744
01:11:15,797 --> 01:11:19,198
What are you doing
here? The girls' cell?

745
01:11:19,267 --> 01:11:23,363
Oh, this place is crazy. It's
like, put you wherever they want.

746
01:11:23,471 --> 01:11:27,840
It's fine with me, I guess,
but... Julie, give us a break.

747
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:31,401
Watch the rest of the
show. Tell us how it ends.

748
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:37,078
Well, we only got
three channels. I hate it.

749
01:11:37,151 --> 01:11:39,244
Brandon, what's goin' on?

750
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,982
You want the truth, don't you?

751
01:11:44,993 --> 01:11:50,693
L-It sounds a lot more
complicated than it is. Um...

752
01:11:50,765 --> 01:11:54,292
Do you have any water? 'Cause
I'm really, my voice is...

753
01:11:54,369 --> 01:11:57,031
dry.

754
01:11:57,138 --> 01:11:59,072
Um...

755
01:12:00,408 --> 01:12:02,376
I'm a hermaphrodite.

756
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:04,411
A what?

757
01:12:04,512 --> 01:12:07,072
Come here.

758
01:12:09,417 --> 01:12:13,820
It's a person who has
both... girl and boy parts.

759
01:12:13,888 --> 01:12:18,188
Brandon’s real name is Teena Brandon.

760
01:12:18,259 --> 01:12:23,424
See, Brandon’s not quite a
he. Brandon’s more like a she.

761
01:12:23,498 --> 01:12:26,763
Shut up. That's your business.

762
01:12:26,834 --> 01:12:31,737
I don't care if you're half monkey or
half ape, I'm gettin' you out of here.

763
01:12:58,299 --> 01:13:00,392
# I would say I'm sorry #

764
01:13:00,468 --> 01:13:05,667
# If I thought that it
would change your mind #

765
01:13:05,773 --> 01:13:10,301
Candace, I spoke to Lana's mom.

766
01:13:10,411 --> 01:13:12,345
She's missing.

767
01:13:13,848 --> 01:13:16,874
- Do you know where she is?
- I don't know, I swear.

768
01:13:16,951 --> 01:13:20,352
Candace, if you know anything,
you better tell me now.

769
01:13:20,421 --> 01:13:23,913
You know what? I already
opened my big mouth.

770
01:13:23,991 --> 01:13:26,323
Now no one's talking to me.

771
01:13:26,394 --> 01:13:29,022
Candace, I'm talking to you.

772
01:13:36,604 --> 01:13:40,734
Either I'm fucked up, or
something's totally weird.

773
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:46,446
Come on, Candy, you can tell
me. I won't tell anybody.

774
01:13:48,416 --> 01:13:51,351
- I need more to drink.
- There you go.

775
01:13:55,723 --> 01:14:00,626
# 'Cause boys don't cry #

776
01:14:02,430 --> 01:14:07,129
#Boys don't cry #

777
01:14:08,336 --> 01:14:11,169
#I would tell you that I loved you #

778
01:14:11,272 --> 01:14:14,332
#If I thought that you would stay #

779
01:14:14,442 --> 01:14:17,240
#But I know that it's no use #

780
01:14:17,311 --> 01:14:20,940
# You've already gone away #

781
01:14:37,198 --> 01:14:38,995
Goddamn it.

782
01:14:39,066 --> 01:14:41,591
I want to touch you
the way you touch me.

783
01:14:43,171 --> 01:14:45,139
No. Wait.

784
01:14:45,206 --> 01:14:48,107
Fuck you, Brandon.

785
01:14:48,176 --> 01:14:50,167
Fuck you.

786
01:14:50,278 --> 01:14:53,338
I want you to feel what I feel.

787
01:14:55,383 --> 01:14:58,819
Lana, wait. Wait.

788
01:15:01,255 --> 01:15:03,223
Soon, I promise.

789
01:15:06,227 --> 01:15:09,287
- Is she back yet?
- No. I'm worried.

790
01:15:09,363 --> 01:15:13,424
- Let's just go find Lana.
- He'll show up.

791
01:15:13,501 --> 01:15:15,401
Tell me what's going on.

792
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:17,664
You read the paper today?

793
01:15:17,772 --> 01:15:20,070
- No.
- Show Mom...

794
01:15:20,174 --> 01:15:23,837
- You promised.
- Is Lana your friend or not?

795
01:15:23,911 --> 01:15:25,936
Gimme that.

796
01:15:27,682 --> 01:15:31,311
"Teena Brandon, age 19, picked
up on speeding violation." So?

797
01:15:31,385 --> 01:15:33,546
- Brandon got a ticket.
- The name, Mom.

798
01:15:33,621 --> 01:15:35,885
The name.

799
01:15:40,027 --> 01:15:43,463
- He's got her brainwashed. That's what they do.
- Get out.

800
01:15:43,531 --> 01:15:46,694
There's nothing in Lana's room.
Get out. Leave her stuff alone.

801
01:15:46,767 --> 01:15:51,727
I'm not touchin' her stuff. If you were any kind
of mother, you wouldn't have let this happen.

802
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:54,330
I've been telling you all
along you couldn't trust him.

803
01:15:54,442 --> 01:15:58,776
- You never told me anything!
- Kate, you've got to stop this.

804
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:01,815
Right. Like you wouldn't jump in
there if it wasn't totally obvious...

805
01:16:01,882 --> 01:16:05,784
that you're in love with Brandon.

806
01:16:05,886 --> 01:16:09,219
Holy fuckin' mother of fuck!

807
01:16:09,257 --> 01:16:11,225
Tom, check this out.

808
01:16:13,561 --> 01:16:15,688
"Cross-dressers and transsexuals:

809
01:16:15,763 --> 01:16:18,561
The Uninvited Dilemma."

810
01:16:18,633 --> 01:16:21,727
Sexual identity crisis. Jesus!

811
01:16:21,802 --> 01:16:24,327
Fuckin Christ, Tom! Check
this out. Look at this.

812
01:16:24,438 --> 01:16:27,566
"The grafted skin will mimic the
loose skin of the natural male penis."

813
01:16:27,675 --> 01:16:30,109
Get this sick shit away from me!

814
01:16:30,177 --> 01:16:33,112
Just give it a minute, okay?

815
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:35,808
She's got to think I was at work.

816
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:38,283
Okay.

817
01:16:38,352 --> 01:16:40,820
But I'll miss you.

818
01:17:02,843 --> 01:17:05,437
- Whoa!
- Thank God you're home.

819
01:17:05,546 --> 01:17:08,140
I go to work and you guys
party all night without me?

820
01:17:08,182 --> 01:17:11,879
- Come on in. Have a beer.
- I've got to take a shower.

821
01:17:11,952 --> 01:17:14,978
I don't mean to be antisocial,
but I'm really tired.

822
01:17:15,056 --> 01:17:19,049
- How was work?
- Whatever, Mom. The usual.

823
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:26,957
Mom, what the hell's goin' on?

824
01:17:27,034 --> 01:17:29,229
God, what did you tell them?

825
01:17:29,303 --> 01:17:32,431
We called work.

826
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:36,772
- We know you weren’t there.
- Why is he talking to me? What are you, my dad?

827
01:17:38,579 --> 01:17:41,912
Why are you all staring at me?

828
01:17:43,851 --> 01:17:48,185
Get away! You're gross. You're
horrible people. Get out of my room!

829
01:17:48,255 --> 01:17:50,849
Honey, we're worried about you.
We're just trying to save you.

830
01:17:50,925 --> 01:17:52,950
You've got a
sick way of showin' it.

831
01:17:53,027 --> 01:17:56,326
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey! Oh, my God.

832
01:17:56,397 --> 01:17:58,331
What's up?

833
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:01,095
Brandon, turn around and walk out
that door now. This is a nuthouse.

834
01:18:01,168 --> 01:18:03,864
- That's fine.
- This is not a nuthouse. I'm just worried about you.

835
01:18:03,971 --> 01:18:05,996
- What's going on?
- Just need to talk about a couple things.

836
01:18:06,107 --> 01:18:08,735
- Why do you need to talk to Brandon?
- There's things I don't understand...

837
01:18:08,843 --> 01:18:10,777
'cause you took a leak with me and...

838
01:18:10,845 --> 01:18:14,508
Pardon my French, Mom. But
you shook off your dick.

839
01:18:14,582 --> 01:18:18,245
What was that bullshit about paying
child support for a kid you can't visit?

840
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:21,914
You been spoutin' nothing but lies
since the minute you came into town.

841
01:18:21,989 --> 01:18:26,016
- When you rode in on your
pussy-whipped faggot horse. - Tom.

842
01:18:26,093 --> 01:18:30,325
The fact is, when it comes right down
to it, you're nothing but a goddamn liar.

843
01:18:30,398 --> 01:18:32,628
- You know what we do to liars?
- No, you guys.

844
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:35,168
- There was never any Memphis, was there?
- Whoo!

845
01:18:35,236 --> 01:18:37,761
Oh, my God. We're
totally fuckin'’ with you.

846
01:18:37,872 --> 01:18:39,840
Seriously.

847
01:18:39,907 --> 01:18:41,875
Go get Brandon a beer.

848
01:18:43,377 --> 01:18:47,313
Wondering about this paper
that you're in, Teena.

849
01:18:53,254 --> 01:18:56,382
Odd. It's our ticket. They're
pretty hungry for news here.

850
01:18:56,457 --> 01:19:01,258
Yeah. But what I'm
wondering about is the name.

851
01:19:01,328 --> 01:19:03,990
Huh, Brandon? I mean, huh, Teena?

852
01:19:04,098 --> 01:19:06,191
Boy, I really fucked up.

853
01:19:06,233 --> 01:19:10,294
I borrowed one of Candace's checks, and
I got that speeding ticket and fake I.D.

854
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:12,862
I guess I need to
learn to stay home, huh?

855
01:19:12,940 --> 01:19:14,931
I invite
you into my home...

856
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:17,476
and you expose my
daughter to your sickness.

857
01:19:17,545 --> 01:19:19,945
Did you ever think
about Lana in all this?

858
01:19:20,014 --> 01:19:22,244
That's all I've been thinking about.

859
01:19:22,316 --> 01:19:25,877
You know, Lana, if you are a
lesbian, you just need to tell me.

860
01:19:25,953 --> 01:19:29,753
- John, I'm not. It's not...
- You gotta stop it. It's not Lana, it's me.

861
01:19:29,824 --> 01:19:32,850
I'm so sorry. Mom, I can
explain. We can work this out.

862
01:19:32,927 --> 01:19:34,918
I have this thing and
I've been to counseling.

863
01:19:34,995 --> 01:19:37,987
You fuckin'g pervert. Are
you a girl or are you not?

864
01:19:38,065 --> 01:19:40,260
Are you a girl or are you not?

865
01:19:40,334 --> 01:19:42,996
- There's a real easy way to solve this problem.
- Fuck you!

866
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:47,268
- Get the fuck off of me!
- No, Tom! Get out of my house!

867
01:19:47,374 --> 01:19:50,138
I should fuckin'’ kill
you for lying to Lana.

868
01:19:50,211 --> 01:19:55,547
There's not gonna be any
killin' goin’ on, okay?

869
01:19:55,616 --> 01:19:59,882
Do you trust me enough to let
Brandon show me? Then I'll tell you.

870
01:20:02,189 --> 01:20:05,625
You trust me enough? Huh?

871
01:20:07,127 --> 01:20:09,061
Okay, John?

872
01:20:09,129 --> 01:20:11,359
All right.

873
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:16,531
Okay. Thank you, God.

874
01:20:18,539 --> 01:20:20,939
Fuck me!

875
01:20:21,008 --> 01:20:24,273
- Holy fuck!
- Get over here.

876
01:20:24,345 --> 01:20:28,213
- I'm so sorry, Brandon.
- Lana, I gotta explain.

877
01:20:28,282 --> 01:20:32,184
No, no. Button up your
pants. Don't show me anything.

878
01:20:32,253 --> 01:20:35,279
Think about it.

879
01:20:35,356 --> 01:20:38,120
- I know you're a guy.
- Okay, but you gotta listen.

880
01:20:38,192 --> 01:20:42,060
I was born with this weirdness.
It's sort of like a birth defect.

881
01:20:42,129 --> 01:20:45,963
I mean, it's actually not that rare,
but these doctors are trying to fix it.

882
01:20:46,033 --> 01:20:49,127
But I have really weird stuff too.

883
01:20:49,203 --> 01:20:54,300
Don't be scared. Look how
beautiful it is out there.

884
01:20:54,408 --> 01:20:56,342
Oh, Lana.

885
01:20:56,410 --> 01:21:01,541
That's us. We can
just beam ourselves out there.

886
01:21:01,782 --> 01:21:04,012
So, what
are you gonna tell 'em?

887
01:21:04,118 --> 01:21:07,246
I'm gonna tell 'em what they wanna hear.

888
01:21:07,288 --> 01:21:10,519
I'm gonna tell 'em what we know is true.

889
01:21:22,102 --> 01:21:25,560
Mom,

890
01:21:25,673 --> 01:21:28,608
I seen him in the full flesh.

891
01:21:28,676 --> 01:21:30,803
I seen it.

892
01:21:30,911 --> 01:21:33,709
I know he's a man.

893
01:21:33,781 --> 01:21:37,615
Problem done. Now, let's go to bed.

894
01:21:37,685 --> 01:21:40,711
Son of a bitch, what
have you done to my baby?

895
01:21:40,788 --> 01:21:45,282
What the fuck are you,
you motherfucker? Huh?

896
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:47,293
Tell me!

897
01:21:53,667 --> 01:21:56,465
You little liar.

898
01:21:56,537 --> 01:21:58,801
- Kate, get her out of here.
- Come on.

899
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:08,507
All I need's the truth,
little buddy. Come on.

900
01:22:11,218 --> 01:22:14,210
All right. I'm sorry to
put you through this. Wait.

901
01:22:14,288 --> 01:22:16,552
- Wait, please. I'll do it!
- Unstrap his belt.

902
01:22:16,624 --> 01:22:19,525
Just turn the light
off. I'll do it. Please!

903
01:22:19,593 --> 01:22:22,153
Fuck, John. Let me the fuck go!

904
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:27,599
What's going on in
there? Open the fuckin'g door!

905
01:22:27,668 --> 01:22:30,136
Open the fuckin'g door!

906
01:22:34,141 --> 01:22:36,735
- John, please.
- What do you see?

907
01:22:36,844 --> 01:22:39,608
- If there's something down there, it's the tiniest one ever.
- Touch it.

908
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:43,616
Oh, goddamn it, I can't. Gotta get...

909
01:22:43,684 --> 01:22:48,144
What the fuck are you? Come on.

910
01:22:48,222 --> 01:22:50,156
Let me go. John, let me go.

911
01:22:54,795 --> 01:22:57,525
Open the fuckin'g door!

912
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:03,028
Don't look like no sexual
identity crisis to me.

913
01:23:04,972 --> 01:23:09,306
- Open the fuckin' door!
- Get in here.

914
01:23:09,376 --> 01:23:13,244
Look at your little boyfriend.
Look at your little boyfriend.

915
01:23:15,249 --> 01:23:18,741
I'm holding you until you look.

916
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,845
- Look!
- Leave him alone!

917
01:23:39,239 --> 01:23:41,207
Leave him alone!

918
01:23:41,275 --> 01:23:43,209
Him? Him?

919
01:23:45,612 --> 01:23:48,740
- Go on, get out of my house.
- We've called the cops.

920
01:23:48,816 --> 01:23:53,116
- Go on, get out!
- You all are just too fucked up!

921
01:23:53,187 --> 01:23:55,382
Leave us all alone!

922
01:23:55,456 --> 01:23:57,822
Leave me alone, please.

923
01:23:57,891 --> 01:24:01,452
- You promised. You promised.
- Leave me alone.

924
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:20,135
I guess that's everything.

925
01:24:20,247 --> 01:24:22,477
You know, I told Brandon...

926
01:24:22,549 --> 01:24:26,485
that nobody has a
right to do that to you.

927
01:24:26,553 --> 01:24:29,818
Come on. We've done everything
we can. Let's get out of here.

928
01:24:29,890 --> 01:24:33,917
- Let's go.
- I'm waitin' for Brandon.

929
01:24:33,994 --> 01:24:35,825
Your mom's right, Lana.

930
01:24:35,896 --> 01:24:38,888
Till this whole thing's straightened
out, it'd be better for everyone...

931
01:24:38,966 --> 01:24:41,491
if Brandon stays someplace else.

932
01:24:41,568 --> 01:24:45,698
What are you talking about? It'd be better
for everyone if you locked up Tom and John.

933
01:24:45,806 --> 01:24:50,106
Lana, everything Teena told
us was lies. Everything.

934
01:24:50,177 --> 01:24:53,374
Everything.

935
01:24:53,447 --> 01:24:56,473
We need to go. Come on... now.

936
01:24:57,918 --> 01:24:59,886
Come on!

937
01:24:59,953 --> 01:25:02,421
Come on, get up!

938
01:25:02,589 --> 01:25:06,548
I'm askin' you this because
if this goes to court,

939
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:11,324
that questions gonna come up
and I'm gonna want an answer.

940
01:25:11,365 --> 01:25:15,096
- Uh, I don't know why I have to...
- All right, let's back up.

941
01:25:15,169 --> 01:25:18,536
After they pulled your pants
down and seen you was a girl,

942
01:25:18,605 --> 01:25:22,063
what'd he do, fondle you any?

943
01:25:27,147 --> 01:25:29,581
No.

944
01:25:40,828 --> 01:25:43,558
Didn't that kind
of get your attention somehow?

945
01:25:43,630 --> 01:25:47,794
That he wouldn't put
his hand in your pants...

946
01:25:47,868 --> 01:25:51,429
and play with you a little bit?

947
01:25:51,505 --> 01:25:53,496
I don't know what he did.

948
01:25:57,945 --> 01:25:59,879
Come on.

949
01:26:03,016 --> 01:26:06,247
Let's go. Come on.

950
01:26:06,353 --> 01:26:10,414
Let's go, buddy. Come on,
let's go for a ride. Move!

951
01:26:13,861 --> 01:26:17,297
I can't believe
that he pulled your pants down,

952
01:26:17,364 --> 01:26:22,301
and if you are a female, that he
didn't stick his hand or finger in you.

953
01:26:22,369 --> 01:26:24,337
Well, he didn't.

954
01:26:41,221 --> 01:26:44,713
Get out of the car. Get out of the car!

955
01:26:44,791 --> 01:26:46,725
Come on.

956
01:26:47,828 --> 01:26:50,228
- John...
- Shut up. Move!

957
01:26:50,297 --> 01:26:52,595
- Wait, John. John, it's me.
- Shut up!

958
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:54,691
- You know me.
- Shut up.

959
01:26:54,768 --> 01:26:57,601
- Don't hurt me. John. John.
- Take off your shirt.

960
01:26:57,671 --> 01:27:02,836
You brought this on yourself.
Tom, get out of the car!

961
01:27:02,943 --> 01:27:06,003
Take off your shirt.
Take off your shirt!

962
01:27:06,113 --> 01:27:09,913
You can make this easy, or you can
get the shit knocked out of you.

963
01:27:09,983 --> 01:27:11,917
All right.

964
01:27:18,358 --> 01:27:21,589
Wait, John, wait. Please, wait.

965
01:27:21,662 --> 01:27:25,689
We can work this out.
Please. Get off me. Get off!

966
01:27:25,766 --> 01:27:29,532
Wait,
John. Please don't hurt me.

967
01:27:29,603 --> 01:27:33,403
After you had your pants off,

968
01:27:33,473 --> 01:27:37,307
how were you positioned in the backseat?

969
01:27:37,377 --> 01:27:39,242
On my back.

970
01:27:39,313 --> 01:27:41,247
You was on your back?

971
01:27:43,383 --> 01:27:46,546
You say you're 21 and you've never
had sex before. Is that correct?

972
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:50,215
- Right.
- No!

973
01:27:50,290 --> 01:27:53,953
When they had a spread of
you and when they poked you,

974
01:27:54,027 --> 01:27:56,552
where'd they try to pop it in first?

975
01:27:56,630 --> 01:27:58,791
I said move your fuckin' hands!

976
01:28:03,303 --> 01:28:04,895
My vagina.

977
01:28:05,005 --> 01:28:07,667
Where?

978
01:28:07,741 --> 01:28:10,403
My vagina.

979
01:28:20,053 --> 01:28:22,647
Go ahead, man. Take her, take her.

980
01:28:33,166 --> 01:28:35,327
Come on. Come on.

981
01:28:35,402 --> 01:28:38,132
Get up there. Get up.

982
01:28:38,205 --> 01:28:40,139
Take this fuckin'g thing off.

983
01:28:43,210 --> 01:28:46,338
Take this fuckin'’ thing off!

984
01:28:54,488 --> 01:28:58,754
No!

985
01:29:08,502 --> 01:29:10,436
Whoo!

986
01:30:14,468 --> 01:30:17,301
Come on, buddy. Up. Let's go.

987
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:20,203
Up.

988
01:30:25,479 --> 01:30:28,778
- You okay? Come on, let's go.
- Yeah.

989
01:30:36,423 --> 01:30:42,293
Now, just... Just take me home, okay?

990
01:30:42,362 --> 01:30:46,196
If you keep our secret, we'll stay
friends. All right, little buddy?

991
01:30:46,266 --> 01:30:50,726
'Cause if you don't, we'll
have to silence you permanently.

992
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:54,903
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

993
01:30:55,008 --> 01:30:57,738
This is all my fault. I know.

994
01:31:08,855 --> 01:31:11,881
You okay in there, little dude?

995
01:31:13,627 --> 01:31:15,993
Yeah.

996
01:31:16,062 --> 01:31:18,087
I'm fine.

997
01:31:29,509 --> 01:31:33,070
I'm gettin’ a beer. You want one?

998
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:35,273
No. I'm fine.

999
01:31:35,382 --> 01:31:37,816
Make sure you get
yourself cleaned up in there.

1000
01:31:40,587 --> 01:31:43,249
Will you need any help?

1001
01:31:46,493 --> 01:31:51,192
No, I'm, I'm good.

1002
01:31:57,704 --> 01:32:00,935
You almost ready in there, little dude?

1003
01:32:01,041 --> 01:32:03,976
Give me a break, man.

1004
01:32:04,077 --> 01:32:07,046
Give me two fuckin'’ seconds.

1005
01:32:11,051 --> 01:32:13,451
Tom! Tom!

1006
01:32:28,068 --> 01:32:31,299
Oh, my God. Brandon.

1007
01:32:31,371 --> 01:32:33,862
What are you doing here?

1008
01:32:33,974 --> 01:32:37,910
Mom, stop it. He's hurt.

1009
01:32:41,481 --> 01:32:43,415
Lana.

1010
01:32:43,483 --> 01:32:47,180
- I don't want "it" in my house.
- Lana.

1011
01:32:48,888 --> 01:32:52,688
- Mom, stop it. He's hurt.
- I'm sorry.

1012
01:32:54,494 --> 01:32:58,658
- Call am ambulance! Now!
- No.

1013
01:33:05,338 --> 01:33:08,330
Okay, almost.

1014
01:33:19,319 --> 01:33:22,254
So they assaulted you?

1015
01:33:25,725 --> 01:33:31,220
If you don't mind,
it's just necessary...

1016
01:33:31,298 --> 01:33:35,701
I, I need for you to
take your pants off. Okay?

1017
01:33:38,138 --> 01:33:40,163
Please.

1018
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:42,868
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1019
01:33:44,878 --> 01:33:48,974
H-How do you know they raped me?

1020
01:34:10,970 --> 01:34:15,430
Why do you run around with
guys, bein' you're a girl yourself?

1021
01:34:15,508 --> 01:34:17,442
Why do you go around kissin' every girl?

1022
01:34:17,510 --> 01:34:20,502
I don't know what this has
to do with what happened.

1023
01:34:20,613 --> 01:34:23,446
'Cause I'm tryin' to get
some answers so I can know...

1024
01:34:23,516 --> 01:34:26,485
exactly what's goin’ on.

1025
01:34:26,553 --> 01:34:30,489
Now, are you gonna answer
my question for me or not?

1026
01:34:33,593 --> 01:34:36,960
I have a sexual identity crisis.

1027
01:34:37,030 --> 01:34:38,964
You what?

1028
01:34:41,267 --> 01:34:44,794
A sexual identity crisis.

1029
01:35:22,942 --> 01:35:24,910
Brandon.

1030
01:35:24,978 --> 01:35:29,415
I just wanted to say I'm really sorry.

1031
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:33,848
Oh, my God!

1032
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:37,083
What did they do to you?

1033
01:35:37,157 --> 01:35:39,921
Oh, my God. Come in here. Come in.

1034
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:43,051
Just go inside.

1035
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:42,553
That is bull.

1036
01:36:42,622 --> 01:36:45,489
If I wanna rape somebody, I got Mallory.

1037
01:36:48,428 --> 01:36:53,161
Listen, John, I'm just here to
tell you that it's been reported.

1038
01:36:53,233 --> 01:36:57,795
- But...
- Listen to me. So if you did anything,

1039
01:36:57,871 --> 01:37:01,500
or anything happened in that
room, you get it cleaned up.

1040
01:37:14,487 --> 01:37:17,923
Um, uh, we went out,

1041
01:37:17,991 --> 01:37:21,392
um, muddin' last night and
we got stuck in a ditch.

1042
01:37:21,461 --> 01:37:24,453
Seriously.

1043
01:37:24,531 --> 01:37:28,331
Why is she fuckin'
makin' lies like that?

1044
01:37:33,606 --> 01:37:35,574
Seriously.

1045
01:37:37,210 --> 01:37:39,735
You want a beer?

1046
01:37:42,215 --> 01:37:45,651
No, not right now. You take care, John.

1047
01:37:45,718 --> 01:37:50,052
I'll come back later and
we'll play cards or something.

1048
01:37:50,123 --> 01:37:53,559
Why don't you just give
it a few days? All right?

1049
01:37:53,626 --> 01:37:55,685
Okay.

1050
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:03,897
- You're such a stupid fuckin'’ pussy!
- What, man?

1051
01:38:04,003 --> 01:38:07,996
You're paranoid. She came here to
warn us. She ain't gonna say nothin'.

1052
01:38:08,074 --> 01:38:10,599
Hello?

1053
01:38:12,645 --> 01:38:16,012
Yes, sir. No, sir.

1054
01:38:16,082 --> 01:38:18,880
Yes, sir, tomorrow morning.

1055
01:38:18,952 --> 01:38:21,045
Yeah, we'll come by.

1056
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:24,055
We have to go by the
station tomorrow morning.

1057
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:03,793
Can I come sit by you?

1058
01:39:22,482 --> 01:39:24,973
Do you hate me?

1059
01:39:29,689 --> 01:39:31,884
Do you need anything?

1060
01:39:45,505 --> 01:39:49,134
Oh, God.

1061
01:39:49,242 --> 01:39:52,109
You're so pretty.

1062
01:39:58,651 --> 01:40:01,313
You're just saying
that 'cause you like me.

1063
01:40:01,387 --> 01:40:03,355
No.

1064
01:40:20,273 --> 01:40:23,208
What were you like...

1065
01:40:23,276 --> 01:40:25,676
before all this?

1066
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:30,847
Were you like me, like a girl-girl?

1067
01:40:33,519 --> 01:40:35,453
Yeah.

1068
01:40:36,789 --> 01:40:39,349
Like a long time ago.

1069
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:44,391
Then I guess I was
just like a boy-girl.

1070
01:40:45,164 --> 01:40:47,632
Then I was just a jerk.

1071
01:40:52,438 --> 01:40:55,236
It's weird.

1072
01:40:55,341 --> 01:40:58,469
Finally everything felt right.

1073
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:07,117
That's pretty weird, huh?

1074
01:41:07,186 --> 01:41:09,746
Yeah.

1075
01:41:11,057 --> 01:41:13,958
That dream I had... the first night?

1076
01:41:15,862 --> 01:41:17,887
We were on the highway together.

1077
01:41:20,099 --> 01:41:22,431
We can still do it.

1078
01:41:24,837 --> 01:41:28,295
Lana, I, um...

1079
01:41:28,374 --> 01:41:30,865
Look, I never been on the highway.

1080
01:41:30,977 --> 01:41:34,435
Or to the Grand Canyon
or anyplace like that.

1081
01:41:34,547 --> 01:41:37,448
Until I came here, I'd never
even been out of Lincoln.

1082
01:41:37,517 --> 01:41:42,477
I never even met my dad.
He died before I was born.

1083
01:41:42,555 --> 01:41:45,922
And my sister ain't no
model out in Hollywood.

1084
01:42:03,543 --> 01:42:06,205
I don't know if I'm
gonna know how to do it.

1085
01:42:06,312 --> 01:42:09,543
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

1086
01:42:55,761 --> 01:42:59,322
Um, I was wonderin'...

1087
01:42:59,398 --> 01:43:02,526
if you wanna come home
to Lincoln with me.

1088
01:43:04,670 --> 01:43:07,104
My mom, she'll love you.

1089
01:43:07,206 --> 01:43:09,766
Then you gotta meet my cousin Lonny.

1090
01:43:09,876 --> 01:43:13,312
He's a pain, but he's great.

1091
01:43:16,449 --> 01:43:19,145
When are we goin’?

1092
01:43:22,855 --> 01:43:26,120
We have to leave tonight.

1093
01:43:26,192 --> 01:43:29,059
But Candace said she'll drive us.

1094
01:43:30,630 --> 01:43:34,726
All right.

1095
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:38,759
- I better get my stuff.
- Okay.

1096
01:43:55,888 --> 01:43:58,413
Be right back.

1097
01:44:12,071 --> 01:44:14,562
Lana.

1098
01:44:14,674 --> 01:44:16,471
Sorry.

1099
01:44:17,843 --> 01:44:22,075
We can leave right now. It's better.

1100
01:44:22,148 --> 01:44:24,844
Okay.

1101
01:44:24,917 --> 01:44:28,114
Don't pack too much.
We'll send for it later.

1102
01:44:28,988 --> 01:44:31,616
By tomorrow morning,

1103
01:44:31,691 --> 01:44:36,219
you and I will be eatin'
breakfast in Lincoln.

1104
01:44:39,765 --> 01:44:41,630
What?

1105
01:44:41,701 --> 01:44:44,966
Did you do something to your hair?

1106
01:44:46,138 --> 01:44:48,902
I don't know.

1107
01:44:49,008 --> 01:44:51,272
You like it?

1108
01:44:51,377 --> 01:44:53,641
I don't know. I guess.

1109
01:44:53,713 --> 01:44:56,944
I'll try and put it back.

1110
01:45:05,091 --> 01:45:07,889
All right. We should go.

1111
01:45:21,007 --> 01:45:23,805
It's okay, Lana.

1112
01:45:23,909 --> 01:45:26,377
You don't have to come with me now.

1113
01:45:26,479 --> 01:45:30,848
There'll be time.

1114
01:45:30,916 --> 01:45:35,148
Just make sure you get out, okay?

1115
01:45:45,398 --> 01:45:48,060
John, what are you doing here?

1116
01:45:48,134 --> 01:45:50,159
Where are they? They here?

1117
01:45:50,236 --> 01:45:53,205
Just wait, okay?

1118
01:45:53,272 --> 01:45:55,638
I'll be right back.

1119
01:45:55,741 --> 01:45:59,438
Brandon ain't here.

1120
01:45:59,545 --> 01:46:04,915
- Where is he?
- I don't know, but he ain't here.

1121
01:46:05,017 --> 01:46:07,508
Where's Lana?

1122
01:46:24,136 --> 01:46:27,003
Brandon’s
out at Candace's place.

1123
01:46:27,073 --> 01:46:29,064
- What?
- He's at Candace's place.

1124
01:46:42,421 --> 01:46:44,981
- You found him?
- Yeah.

1125
01:46:45,057 --> 01:46:47,685
- What are you guys doin’?
- Oh, shit.

1126
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:50,320
I know I've been a jerk lately.
You wanna go out for a drink?

1127
01:46:50,396 --> 01:46:52,523
- No. - I'll
buy. - Yeah, yeah.

1128
01:47:07,947 --> 01:47:11,439
- Where're we goin’?
- Told you not to bring her.

1129
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:14,178
Stay off the main road.

1130
01:47:17,123 --> 01:47:20,524
Think they'd recognize her if we
chopped off her head and hands?

1131
01:47:24,630 --> 01:47:26,928
John.

1132
01:47:26,999 --> 01:47:29,695
We're just takin' care
of a couple of dykes.

1133
01:47:29,768 --> 01:47:33,727
- Are you one of 'em?
- Where'd you get that?

1134
01:47:38,110 --> 01:47:42,012
You still planning on going to Memphis?

1135
01:47:42,081 --> 01:47:45,380
Memphis.

1136
01:48:06,505 --> 01:48:08,700
What are we doin’ here?

1137
01:48:08,774 --> 01:48:11,072
If there's other people in there,
you gotta take care of ‘em, all right?

1138
01:48:11,177 --> 01:48:15,204
What are you gonna do
to Candace? John, no. No.

1139
01:48:15,314 --> 01:48:18,283
John, no! She's got a baby!

1140
01:48:18,384 --> 01:48:20,614
Look at me. No!

1141
01:48:20,686 --> 01:48:23,211
Get the fuck off of me!

1142
01:48:23,289 --> 01:48:25,120
Candace!

1143
01:48:25,191 --> 01:48:28,456
Get the light. The light!

1144
01:48:28,527 --> 01:48:33,123
Where the fuck is it?

1145
01:48:33,199 --> 01:48:37,101
- Where the fuck is she?
- John. John.

1146
01:48:37,169 --> 01:48:40,764
Don't hurt my baby!

1147
01:48:40,839 --> 01:48:44,502
- Shut the fuck up! Don't listen to her.
- Don't hurt Candace.

1148
01:48:44,610 --> 01:48:47,010
She has nothing to do with this.

1149
01:48:47,079 --> 01:48:51,038
You were right about me. I just
keep gettin’ back up, you know...

1150
01:48:51,150 --> 01:48:53,448
- Shut up. Shut up!
- John.

1151
01:48:53,519 --> 01:48:56,147
Candace!

1152
01:48:56,222 --> 01:48:58,747
- Don't listen to her.
- I said, shut up.

1153
01:48:58,824 --> 01:49:00,553
John.

1154
01:49:03,128 --> 01:49:06,291
Teena...

1155
01:49:06,398 --> 01:49:10,664
Please, don't hurt my baby, Tom. Please!

1156
01:49:10,703 --> 01:49:12,671
Why didn't you leave?

1157
01:49:14,406 --> 01:49:16,169
We can still do it.

1158
01:49:24,283 --> 01:49:27,616
No!

1159
01:49:28,721 --> 01:49:31,087
No!

1160
01:49:36,629 --> 01:49:40,030
John, don't!
Please don't hurt my baby.

1161
01:49:40,099 --> 01:49:42,533
Please, John! Please!

1162
01:50:03,422 --> 01:50:06,186
No!

1163
01:50:06,258 --> 01:50:08,624
No!

1164
01:50:10,129 --> 01:50:14,566
Come on, Lana. Come on! Come on, Lana!

1165
01:50:14,633 --> 01:50:16,760
Come on.

1166
01:52:47,719 --> 01:52:52,588
Dear Lana. By the time
you read this, I'll be back home in Lincoln.

1167
01:52:52,658 --> 01:52:55,957
I'm scared of what's ahead,
but when I think of you...

1168
01:52:56,028 --> 01:52:58,963
I know I'll be able to go on.

1169
01:52:59,031 --> 01:53:02,626
You were right. Memphis
isn't far at all.

1170
01:53:02,701 --> 01:53:06,000
I'll be making a trip out on
the highway before too long.

1171
01:53:06,104 --> 01:53:08,038
I'll be waiting for you.

1172
01:53:08,073 --> 01:53:11,668
Love always and forever, Brandon.

1173
01:53:19,818 --> 01:53:25,188
# The lonesome
Texas sun was setting low #

1174
01:53:28,227 --> 01:53:34,632
#And in the rearview
mirror I watched it go #

1175
01:53:36,502 --> 01:53:38,766
#I can still see the
wind in her golden hair #

1176
01:53:38,837 --> 01:53:43,297
#I can still see the
wind in her golden hair #

1177
01:53:45,477 --> 01:53:48,605
#I close my eyes for a moment #

1178
01:53:48,714 --> 01:53:54,084
#I'm still there #

1179
01:53:54,152 --> 01:53:57,883
# The bluest eyes in Texas #

1180
01:53:57,956 --> 01:54:02,154
#Are haunting me tonight #

1181
01:54:02,227 --> 01:54:06,721
#Like the stars that
fill the midnight sky #

1182
01:54:06,832 --> 01:54:11,701
- #Her memory fills my mind #
- # Where did I go wrong #

1183
01:54:11,737 --> 01:54:14,968
#Did I wait too long #

1184
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:19,534
# Or can I make it right #

1185

1186

#Are haunting me tonight #

1187
01:54:30,489 --> 01:54:36,894
#Another town Another hotel room #

1188
01:54:39,031 --> 01:54:47,735
#Another dream that ended way too soon #

1189
01:54:47,806 --> 01:54:54,234
#Left me lonely way before the dawn #

1190
01:54:56,281 --> 01:55:04,620
#Searching for the
strength to carry on #

1191
01:55:04,690 --> 01:55:08,592
# The bluest eyes in Texas #

1192

#For every heart you
break you pay the price #

1201
01:56:06,485 --> 01:56:09,977
#But I can't forget the tears #

1202
01:56:10,055 --> 01:56:15,391
#In her blue eyes #

1203
