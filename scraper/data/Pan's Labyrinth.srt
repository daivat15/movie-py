1
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:19,130
<i>Spain, 1944</i>

2
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,935
<i>The Civil War is over.</i>

3
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,765
<i>Hidden in the mountains...</i>

4
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,965
<i>...armed men are still fighting
the new Fascist regime.</i>

5
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,270
<i>Military posts are established
to exterminate the Resistance.</i>

6
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,160
<i>A long time ago...</i>

7
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,200
<i>...in the Underground Realm,
where there are no lies or pain...</i>

8
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,270
<i>...there lived a princess who dreamt
of the human world.</i>

9
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,480
<i>She dreamt of blue skies,
soft breeze and sunshine.</i>

10
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,790
<i>One day...</i>

11
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,160
<i>...eluding her keepers,
the princess escaped.</i>

12
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,060
<i>Once outside...</i>

13
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,170
<i>...the bright sun blinded her
and erased her memory.</i>

14
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,310
<i>She forgot who she was
and where she came from.</i>

15
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:50,020
<i>Her body suffered cold, sickness and pain.
And eventually she died.</i>

16
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,590
<i>However, her father, the King...</i>

17
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,920
<i>...always knew that
the Princess' soul would return...</i>

18
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,900
<i>...perhaps in another body...</i>

19
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,090
<i>...in another place, at another time.</i>

20
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,030
<i>He would wait for her,
until he drew his last breath...</i>

21
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,670
<i>...until the world stopped turning.</i>

22
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,040
Why did you bring
so many books, Ofelia?

23
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,810
We're going to the country,
the outdoors.

24
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,990
Fairy tales?

25
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,490
You're a bit too old to be
filling your head with such nonsense.

26
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,470
Ask him to stop the car.

27
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,450
Ofelia, wait.

28
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,750
Your brother's not well.

29
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,520
Madam, are you okay?

30
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,330
Ofelia?

31
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,630
Ofelia, Come here.

32
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,070
- I saw a fairy.
- Just look at your shoes!

33
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,300
Let's go.

34
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,350
When we get to the mill,
come out to greet the Captain.

35
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,410
I want you to call him Father.

36
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,290
You have no idea
how good he's been to us.

37
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,990
It's just a word, Ofelia.
Just a word.

38
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,650
They're coming, Captain.

39
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,140
15 minutes late.

40
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,270
Carmen.

41
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,050
Welcome.

42
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,290
That's not necessary.
I can walk perfectly well.

43
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,230
Doctor Ferreiro prefers
that you don't exert yourself.

44
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,790
No.

45
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,830
Come.
Do it for me.

46
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,100
Thank you.

47
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,130
Ofelia, come out.

48
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,240
Say hello to the Captain.

49
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,340
Ofelia.

50
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,690
It's the other hand, Ofelia.

51
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,660
Mercedes!

52
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,770
- Bring the luggage.
- Sir.

53
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,030
It's a labyrinth.

54
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,100
Just a pile of old rocks
that have always been here.

55
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,400
Even before the mill.

56
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,410
Better not to go in there.
You may get lost.

57
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,240
Thank you.

58
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,120
Have you read them all?

59
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,550
Mercedes!

60
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,650
The Captain is calling.

61
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,320
Your father needs me.

62
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,390
He's not my father.

63
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,820
The Captain is not my father.

64
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,330
My father was a tailor.
He died in the war.

65
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,800
He's not my father.

66
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,640
You've made that clear enough.
Shall we go?

67
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,140
Have you seen my mother?

68
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,200
- Isn't she beautiful!
- Yes.

69
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,010
She's sick with baby.
Did you notice?

70
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,670
The guerrillas are sticking
to the woods...

71
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,770
...because it's hard
to track them up there.

72
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,240
Those bastards know the terrain
better than any of us.

73
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,070
We'll block all access
to the woods.

74
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,510
Food, medicine...
We'll store it all. Right here.

75
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,580
We need to force them down,
make them come to us.

76
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,650
We'll set up three
new command posts.

77
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,420
Here, here and here.

78
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,620
Mercedes.

79
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,420
- Ask Dr. Ferreiro to come down.
- Yes, sir.

80
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,230
This will help you sleep
through the night.

81
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,030
Just two drops just before bed.

82
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,370
Two drops only.

83
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,740
Very good.

84
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,910
All of it.
Good.

85
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,880
Don't hesitate to call me
if you need anything. Day or night.

86
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,520
You or your nurse.

87
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,320
Good night.

88
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,860
Close the door
and turn off the lights, sweetie.

89
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,010
You have to help us.
Come up and see him.

90
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,480
The wound is getting worse.
His leg isn't any better.

91
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,420
This is all I could get.

92
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,650
I'm sorry.

93
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,550
Captain Vidal is waiting
for you in his office.

94
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,060
Come here, Ofelia.

95
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,500
Jesus, your feet.
They're frozen!

96
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,510
Are you afraid?

97
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,740
A little.

98
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,950
What's that noise?

99
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,150
Nothing, just the wind.

100
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,830
Nights here are different
from city nights.

101
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,790
There, you hear cars-tramway.

102
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,200
Here the houses are old.

103
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,960
They creak.

104
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,910
As if they were speaking.

105
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,390
Tomorrow, I'm going
to give you a surprise.

106
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,750
- A surprise?
- Yes.

107
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:57,730
- A book?
- No, something much better.

108
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,670
Why did you have to get married?

109
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,240
I was alone too long.

110
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,970
I'm with you.
You weren't alone.

111
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,500
You were never alone.

112
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,720
When you're older, you'll understand.
It hasn't been easy for me either.

113
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,290
Your brother's at it again.

114
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,290
Tell him one of your stories.

115
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,530
I'm sure that'll calm down.

116
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,990
My brother, my brother.

117
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,610
Many, many years ago...

118
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,350
<i>...in a sad, faraway land...</i>

119
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:56,180
<i>...there was an enormous mountain
made of rough, black stone.</i>

120
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,520
<i>At sunset...</i>

121
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,450
<i>...on top of that mountain...</i>

122
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:06,130
<i>...a magic rose blossomed every night
that made whoever plucked it immortal.</i>

123
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,900
<i>But no one dared go near it...</i>

124
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,530
<i>...because its thorns were full of poison.</i>

125
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:27,340
<i>Men talked amongst themselves
about their fear of death...</i>

126
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:32,050
<i>...and pain, but never about
the promise of eternal life.</i>

127
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:43,970
<i>And every day, the rose wilted
unable to bequeath its gift to anyone.</i>

128
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,430
<i>Forgotten and lost at the top
of that cold, dark mountain...</i>

129
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,170
<i>...forever alone,
until the end of time.</i>

130
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,020
Come in.

131
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,330
- How is she?
- Very weak.

132
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,300
She'll have as much rest
as she needs.

133
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,590
I'll sleep down here.

134
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,260
- And my son?
- Pardon?

135
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,410
Excuse us, Captain.

136
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,500
My son, how is he?

137
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,180
For the moment, there's no
reason to be alarmed.

138
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,280
Very good.

139
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:42,180
Captain, your wife should not have
traveled at such a late stage of pregnancy.

140
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,130
- Is that your opinion?
- My professional opinion, yes, sir.

141
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,740
A son should be born
wherever his father is.

142
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,260
That's all.

143
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,210
One more thing, Captain.

144
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,240
What makes you so sure
the baby is a male?

145
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,520
Don't fuck with me.

146
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,980
At 8 o'clock we detected movement
in the northwestern sector.

147
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,480
Gunfire.

148
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,790
Sergeant Bayona searched the area
and captured a suspect.

149
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,490
The other one's his son,
here from the town.

150
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,970
Captain, my father
is an honest man.

151
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,090
Let me judge that.
Take your hat off in front of me.

152
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,770
We found this weapon on him.
It's been fired.

153
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,670
My father was hunting
rabbits, Captain.

154
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,300
Again, keep quiet.

155
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,650
"No God, no country, no Master"?

156
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,250
- Just like that-how do you like that?
- Red propaganda, Captain.

157
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,190
It's not propaganda, sir.

158
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,200
It's an old almanac, Captain.

159
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,900
We're just farmers.

160
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,330
Go on.

161
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,340
I went up into the woods, Captain.
To hunt for rabbits.

162
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,100
For my daughters.
They're sick.

163
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,180
Rabbits, uh?

164
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:16,380
Captain, if my father says so,
he was hunting rabbits.

165
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,460
Leave him alone.

166
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,670
You killed him,
You killed him!

167
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,170
Murderer!
Son of a bitch!

168
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,100
Maybe you'll learn to search
these assholes properly...

169
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,930
...before you come bothering me.

170
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,370
Yes, Captain.

171
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:38,070
Mother.
Mother, wake up!

172
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:41,830
Mother, there's something in the room.

173
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,180
Hello.

174
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,570
Did you follow me here?

175
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,510
Are you a fairy?

176
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:31,850
Look!

177
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,680
This is a fairy.

178
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,150
You want me to go with you?

179
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,190
Outside?
Where?

180
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,870
Hello?

181
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,770
Hello?

182
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,920
Echo.

183
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,960
Echo.

184
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,940
Hello?

185
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,310
Hello?

186
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,220
It's you.

187
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,690
It's you.
You've returned.

188
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,820
Don't be frightened, I beg you.

189
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,100
Look, look.

190
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,000
My name is Ofelia.
Who are you?

191
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,310
Me?

192
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,350
I've had so many names.

193
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:56,550
Old names that only the wind
and the trees can pronounce.

194
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:03,570
I am the mountain,
the forest and the earth.

195
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,670
I am...

196
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,940
I am a faun.

197
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:16,740
Your most humble servant,
Your Highness.

198
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,510
- No, I'm...
- You're Princess Moanna...

199
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:26,280
...daughter of the King
of the underworld.

200
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,090
My father was a tailor.

201
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,320
You are not born of man.

202
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,800
It was the moon that bore you.

203
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,260
Look on your left shoulder...

204
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:39,400
...and you will find a mark
that proves it.

205
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:49,800
Your real father had us open portals
all over the world to allow your return.

206
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,940
This is...

207
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,180
This is the last of them.

208
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:04,420
But we have to make sure
that your essence is intact...

209
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:09,060
...that you have not become a mortal.

210
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,270
You must complete three tasks
before the moon is full.

211
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:27,240
This is The Book of Crossroads.

212
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:31,080
Open it, when you are alone...

213
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,120
...and it will show you your future...

214
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:38,560
...show you what must be done.

215
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,500
But there's nothing in here.

216
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,020
Mercedes, prepare these rabbits
for dinner tonight.

217
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:52,060
They are too young.

218
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:55,630
- Well, maybe they'll do for a stew.
- Yes, sir.

219
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:01,100
This coffee was burnt.
Taste it yourself.

220
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:12,390
You should keep an eye on it.

221
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,620
As you wish, sir.

222
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,150
Cook these.

223
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,400
- He didn't like the coffee.
- He's nothing but a fussy dandy.

224
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,405
A fussy dandy!

225
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,705
We're going to need some beef
and one more chicken.

226
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:34,570
- Where are we supposed to find that?
- The doctor's wife, the mayor's too.

227
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,640
Well, they eat more
than a couple of pigs.

228
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:42,310
- And they don't shut up.
- Not even underwater.

229
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,290
I'll be back in a moment,
Mercedes.

230
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,670
Ofelia.

231
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,980
Your father is giving
a dinner party tonight.

232
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,210
Look what I've made for you.

233
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:16,850
Do you like it?

234
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,650
What I wouldn't have given
to have such a dress...

235
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:24,230
...as fine as this when I was your age!

236
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,520
And look at the shoes!

237
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,590
- Do you like them?
- Yes, very pretty.

238
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,900
Go on, now.
Take your bath.

239
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,350
<i>Tree</i>

240
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,649
<i>Once upon a time,
when the forest was young</i>

241
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:30,149
<i>they were home to creatures
who were full of magic and wonder.</i>

242
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,649
<i>They protected one another and slept
in the shade of a colossal fig tree</i>

243
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,749
<i>that grew on a hill, near the mill.</i>

244
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,750
<i>But now, the tree is dying.</i>

245
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:38,560
Ofelia?

246
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,900
Ofelia?

247
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,800
Hurry up.
I want to see the dress on you.

248
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,640
I want you to be beautiful
for the Captain.

249
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,240
You'll look like a Princess.

250
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,050
A Princess?

251
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,120
Make sure those chickens
are cleaned properly.

252
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,700
And don't forget the beans.

253
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:17,310
- You look marvelous, my girl, just beautiful.
- What a gorgeous dress!

254
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,230
Get back to work,
stop wasting time.

255
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,520
Do you want some milk with honey?

256
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:36,010
Move back, we can't have you getting milk
on your dress, with you looking so pretty.

257
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,330
Mercedes.
Do you believe in fairies?

258
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,360
No.

259
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,530
But when I was a little girl,
I did.

260
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,200
I believed in a lot of things
I don't believe any more.

261
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,340
Last night,
a fairy visited me.

262
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,400
Really?

263
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,780
And it wasn't alone,
there were lots of them...

264
00:29:59,815 --> 00:30:01,480
- ...and a faun, too.
- A faun?

265
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:05,710
He was very old, very tall
and smelled like earth.

266
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,780
My mother warned me
to be wary of fauns.

267
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,080
Mercedes!

268
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,000
Come with me.

269
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,470
Captain,
everything is here.

270
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,410
Flour, salt, oil, medicine...

271
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,710
...olives, bacon.

272
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,680
This-this is real tobacco.

273
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,050
And the ration cards.

274
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,750
- I need you to check the inventory.
- Very well.

275
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,250
Mercedes.

276
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,160
- The key.
- Yes, sir.

277
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,440
- Is this the only copy?
- The only one.

278
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,340
From now on, I'll carry it.

279
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,210
Captain.

280
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,580
Captain,
perhaps it's nothing.

281
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:17,980
It's them.

282
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:33,730
<i>"Once upon a time,
when the forest was young..."</i>

283
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:39,940
<i>"...they were home to creatures
who were full of magic and wonder."</i>

284
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,090
<i>"They protected one another..."</i>

285
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:52,560
<i>"...and slept in the shade
of a colossal fig tree..."</i>

286
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,430
<i>...that grew on a hill, near the mill."</i>

287
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,730
<i>"But now, the tree is dying."</i>

288
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:03,730
<i>"Its branches are dry,
its trunk old and twisted."</i>

289
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,770
<i>"A monstrous toad
has settled in its roots..."</i>

290
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,510
<i>"...and won't let the tree thrive."</i>

291
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:14,010
<i>"You must put the three magic
stones in the toad's mouth..."</i>

292
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,140
<i>"...and retrieve the golden key
from inside his belly."</i>

293
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,920
<i>"Only then will the fig tree
flourish again."</i>

294
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,240
They were here
less than twenty minutes ago.

295
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,880
They left in a hurry.

296
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,920
A dozen men, at most.

297
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,210
Antibiotics.

298
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:26,340
Shit, they forgot this lottery ticket.

299
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:29,880
They're here.

300
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,220
Those sons of bitches are here...

301
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,220
...and they're watching us.

302
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,870
Hey!

303
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,700
You left this behind!

304
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,440
And your lottery ticket!

305
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,070
Why don't you come back
and get it?

306
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,280
Who knows?
This could be your lucky day!

307
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:16,980
Hello.
I'm Princess Moanna...

308
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,830
...and I'm not afraid of you.

309
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,530
Aren't you ashamed
living down here...

310
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,760
...eating all these bugs...

311
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:31,470
...and growing fat
while the tree dies?

312
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,050
Hey!

313
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:16,400
Have you looked in her room?
And the pantry?

314
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,800
Yes, ma'am.

315
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:23,000
Have you checked the garden?

316
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:25,140
- And the barn?
- Yes, ma'am.

317
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,570
Where is that girl?

318
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:28,950
This way, please.

319
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:32,980
Let me to introduce you
to my wife, Carmen.

320
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,720
- Charmed.
- A pleasure to meet you.

321
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:40,630
From now on,
one ration card per family.

322
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,360
Take a look.

323
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,690
- One?
- Only one.

324
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,270
Captain, I'm not sure
it'll be enough.

325
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,670
If people are careful,
it should be plenty.

326
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:51,940
We can't allow anyone to send food
to the guerillas in the mountains.

327
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:55,940
They're losing ground,
and one of them is wounded.

328
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:59,550
Excuse me, Captain,
how can you be so sure?

329
00:39:59,585 --> 00:40:02,280
We almost got them.
We found this.

330
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:04,310
Antibiotics.

331
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,920
God has already
saved their souls.

332
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:10,820
What happens to their bodies
hardly matter to Him.

333
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:13,480
We'll help however we can, Captain.

334
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,760
We know you're not here by choice.

335
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,190
You're wrong about that.

336
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:26,270
I choose to be here because I want
my son to be born in a new, clean Spain.

337
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,340
Because these people
hold the mistaken belief...

338
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:32,170
...that we're all equal.

339
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,250
But there's a big difference:

340
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:37,380
The war is over and we won.

341
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:40,920
And if we need to kill every one
of these vermin to settle it...

342
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,090
...then we'll kill them all,
and that's that.

343
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:46,850
We're all here by choice.

344
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,060
By choice!

345
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:55,770
Put the coffee on.
I'm going for more wood.

346
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,900
We'll take care of it.

347
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,030
Ofelia?

348
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:40,910
So, how did you
and the Captain meet?

349
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:46,150
Ofelia's father used to make
the Captain's uniforms.

350
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,260
Oh, I see.

351
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:51,990
And after he died,
I went to work at the shop.

352
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:54,320
A little more than a year ago...

353
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:59,030
...the Captain and I met again.

354
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,690
Curious, isn't it!

355
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:03,940
I mean, finding each other again?

356
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:08,140
Oh, yes,
very, very curious.

357
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:12,110
Please, forgive my wife.
She hasn't been exposed to the world.

358
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,850
She thinks these silly stories
are interesting to others.

359
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,540
We understand.

360
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,120
Excuse me, madam
Ofelia is here.

361
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,260
Excuse me.

362
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,400
Have I told you that I was acquainted
with your father, Captain?

363
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:40,040
No.
I had no idea.

364
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,270
In Morocco.

365
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,650
I knew him only briefly,
but he left a great impression.

366
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,910
An excellent soldier.

367
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:53,690
The men in his battalion said that when
General Vidal died on the battlefield...

368
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:56,150
...he smashed his watch on a rock...

369
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,850
...so that his son would know
the exact hour and minute of his death.

370
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,290
So he would know
how a brave man dies.

371
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:07,890
Nonsense.
He didn't own a watch.

372
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:12,700
What you've done hurts me.

373
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,840
After your bath,
you'll go to bed without supper.

374
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:19,940
Are you listening?

375
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,180
Sometimes I think
you'll never learn to behave.

376
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,050
You've disappointed me, Ofelia.

377
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:32,530
And your father, too.

378
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,260
You mean the Captain?

379
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,700
Him more than me.

380
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:54,580
I've got the key.

381
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,950
Take me to the Labyrinth.

382
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:54,200
Hello.

383
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:57,810
I got the key out.

384
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,750
That's me,
and the girl is you.

385
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:05,280
And the baby?

386
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,890
So... you retrieved the key.

387
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:12,920
I'm glad.

388
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:25,870
She believed in you
from the very beginning.

389
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,940
She's so glad you succeeded.

390
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,380
Keep the key.

391
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,980
You'll be needing it very soon.

392
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:45,060
And this too,
a piece of chalk.

393
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,735
Two tasks remain...

394
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:54,600
...and the moon is almost full.

395
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,500
Be patient.

396
00:45:56,770 --> 00:46:05,480
We'll soon stroll through
the seven circular gardens of your palace.

397
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:08,110
How do I know
that what you say is true?

398
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:14,360
Why would a poor little faun
like me lie to you?

399
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,670
Proceed.

400
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:41,150
Have your cards
ready for inspection.

401
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,940
Let's go.
Your name?

402
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:49,180
Your names, first and last.

403
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:53,820
Narciso Pena Soriano,
at your service.

404
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:56,150
<i>Name?</i>

405
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:59,560
This is our daily bread
in Franco's Spain...

406
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,900
...kept safe in this mill!
The Reds lie...

407
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:05,930
...because in a united Spain...

408
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:09,810
...there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

409
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:27,590
Come on, show me
what happens now?

410
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,120
Show me.

411
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:08,760
Ofelia, help me...

412
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:16,480
Captain! Captain!

413
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:20,610
Come quickly.

414
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:22,450
...because in a united Spain...

415
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:26,420
...there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

416
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:29,220
This is our daily bread
in Franco's Spain...

417
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:35,100
Your wife needs
uninterrupted rest.

418
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:39,870
She'll have to be sedated
most of the time.

419
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,440
The girl should sleep
somewhere else.

420
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:48,270
I'll stay here until the birth.

421
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:49,710
Make her well.

422
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:53,070
I don't care what it costs
or what you need.

423
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:58,480
Make her well.

424
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:21,280
Don't worry.

425
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,940
Your mother will get better soon,
you'll see.

426
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,940
Having a baby is complicated.

427
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:33,920
Then I'll never have one.

428
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:49,300
You're helping the men
in the woods, aren't you?

429
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:02,280
Have you told anyone?

430
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:04,980
No, I haven't.

431
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:09,280
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

432
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,460
Nor I to you.

433
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:25,130
Do you know a lullaby?

434
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:28,340
Only one...

435
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,500
...but I don't remember the words.

436
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:35,410
I don't care.
I still want to hear it.

437
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:31,530
Don't be afraid.
It's only me.

438
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,450
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

439
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:44,750
Then let's go.

440
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,230
This is sheer madness.

441
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:54,030
When that man finds out about us,
he'll kill us all.

442
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:57,660
- Have you thought about that?
- Are you so afraid of him, Doctor?

443
00:51:58,070 --> 00:52:00,030
It's not fear...

444
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,000
...at least not for myself.

445
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:15,180
Pedro!

446
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,920
Pedro, My brother!

447
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:36,730
You didn't carry out the task.

448
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:40,170
No, my mother is sick.

449
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:44,300
That's no excuse
for negligence.

450
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:49,450
Look.
This is a mandrake root.

451
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:53,420
A plant that dreamt
of being human.

452
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:59,020
Put it under your mother's bed...

453
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:02,630
...in a bowl of fresh milk.

454
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:08,190
Each morning,
give it two drops of blood.

455
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,700
Now, we have no time
to waste.

456
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:15,770
The full moon will be upon us.

457
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:20,610
Take my pets
to guide you through.

458
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:26,810
You're going to a very dangerous
place, so be careful.

459
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:29,790
The thing that slumbers there...

460
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:33,220
...it is not human.

461
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:44,230
You will see a sumptuous feast,
but don't eat or drink anything.

462
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:49,170
Absolutely nothing.

463
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:54,370
Your life depends on it.

464
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:20,000
I've brought some Orujo,
tobacco, cheese.

465
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:23,080
Mail for Trigo and Piloto.

466
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:27,120
Let's see how that leg's doing, Frenchie.

467
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,120
How do you think it's doing?
It's fucked up.

468
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:33,180
Let's see.

469
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:39,520
...N-North American...

470
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:43,560
...British and Canadian troops...

471
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:47,190
...disembarked on a small beach
in the North of F-F.

472
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,730
- "France", idiot.
- F-f-f-rance.

473
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:53,630
More than 150,000 soldiers
give us hope...

474
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:58,680
...under the command
of General Dwight D. Eisenhower...

475
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,850
Is it really bad, doctor?

476
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,510
Look, Frenchie.

477
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:07,350
There's no way to save it.

478
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:22,530
I'll try to make it
in as few cuts as possible.

479
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:33,710
Wait a second, doctor,
just a second.

480
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:14,980
<i>"Use the chalk to trace a door
anywhere in your room."</i>

481
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,120
<i>"Once the door's open,
start the hourglass."</i>

482
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:28,560
<i>"Let the fairies guide you."</i>

483
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:37,280
<i>"Don't eat or drink anything,
during your stay..."</i>

484
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:42,070
<i>"...and come back
before the last grain of sand falls."</i>

485
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:52,070
No.

486
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,110
This other one.

487
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:33,630
No! No!

488
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:51,350
We'll soon have reinforcements
from Jaca.

489
01:02:51,790 --> 01:02:55,690
Fifty men or more.
Then we'll go head to head with Vidal.

490
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,220
And then what?

491
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:03,620
You kill him, they'll send another
just like him. And another...

492
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:07,430
You're screwed, no guns,
no safe shelter...

493
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:11,770
You need food, medicine.
You must take care of Mercedes.

494
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:13,740
If you really love her,
you'd cross the border with her.

495
01:03:13,810 --> 01:03:16,240
- This is a lost cause.
- I'm staying here, doctor.

496
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:17,540
There's no choice.

497
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,120
You have to leave.

498
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:35,830
Here's the key,
but you can't go down there now.

499
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:38,330
It's exactly what he expects.

500
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,470
Leave it to me.

501
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:47,670
I'm a coward.

502
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:51,300
No, you're not.

503
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,710
Yes, I am.

504
01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:58,790
A coward... for living
next to that son of a bitch...

505
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:02,890
...doing his laundry, making his bed,
feeding him.

506
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:09,090
What if the doctor's right
and we can't win?

507
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,630
At least we'll make things
harder for that bastard.

508
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:11,490
Captain Vidal.

509
01:06:13,590 --> 01:06:16,110
Her temperature's down.
I don't know how, but it is.

510
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:17,860
But she still has a fever?

511
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:21,390
Yes, but it's a good sign.
Her body is responding.

512
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,160
Listen to me.

513
01:06:24,830 --> 01:06:27,860
If you have to choose,
save the baby.

514
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,560
That boy will bear my name
and my father's name.

515
01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:31,690
Save him.

516
01:07:07,710 --> 01:07:08,680
Brother.

517
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:11,610
Little brother...

518
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:15,370
If you can hear me...

519
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,650
...things out here aren't too good.

520
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,510
But soon you'll have to come out.

521
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:25,420
You've made Mama very sick.

522
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:31,260
I want to ask you one favor
for when you come out...

523
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,530
...just one:

524
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:36,530
Don't hurt her.

525
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:40,970
You'll meet her,
she's very pretty...

526
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:44,070
...even though sometimes
she's sad for days at a time.

527
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:47,040
You'll see, when she smiles...

528
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:50,140
...you'll love her.

529
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:55,820
Listen, if you do what I say...

530
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:57,680
...I'll make you a promise...

531
01:07:58,630 --> 01:08:02,260
...I'll take you to my kingdom,
and I'll make you a prince.

532
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:06,430
I promise you, a prince.

533
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:35,620
I sounded the whistle,
but they wouldn't move.

534
01:08:35,830 --> 01:08:38,230
I tried to stop, but it was too late.

535
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:40,730
The fireman and I
jumped out just in time...

536
01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:42,370
...but look at the mess they made.

537
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:47,270
What did they steal
from the freight cars?

538
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:49,570
They didn't open a single one.

539
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,280
What the hell are you talking about?

540
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:53,710
This whole mess.
They didn't open any of the cars.

541
01:08:53,910 --> 01:08:58,210
- They didn't take anything.
- Nothing? Are you sure?

542
01:08:58,590 --> 01:09:02,450
God only knows what they wanted,
other than to waste our time.

543
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:21,070
They came out of nowhere, Captain.

544
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:27,580
They have grenades,
they went up hill.

545
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:35,080
Captain, we've surrounded
a small unit that fell behind.

546
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:36,910
They took cover up on the hill.

547
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:16,490
Go ahead, Serrano, don't be afraid,
this is the only decent way to die.

548
01:11:00,210 --> 01:11:01,400
Serrano!

549
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:21,650
Let me see.
Let me see.

550
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,490
Can you talk?

551
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:32,870
Damn it!

552
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:54,050
These are useless! They can't talk.

553
01:12:03,370 --> 01:12:06,030
Captain,
this one's still alive.

554
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:11,480
Shot in the leg.

555
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:18,780
- What's happened?
- They caught one.

556
01:12:18,890 --> 01:12:21,250
They took one of them alive.
And they're taking him to the storeroom.

557
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:27,590
Mercedes!

558
01:12:28,430 --> 01:12:30,660
Pedro... Pedro...

559
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,080
Mercedes?

560
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:53,010
- I need to get into the storeroom.
- Not now.

561
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,850
Move away!

562
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:24,180
That's plenty, dear.

563
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,250
Should I take this up?

564
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:51,580
Here, half the dose.

565
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,880
I don't think I need it.

566
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:57,170
I feel better, much better.

567
01:13:57,450 --> 01:13:59,850
I don't understand.
But I'm glad.

568
01:14:03,190 --> 01:14:03,780
Mother...

569
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:21,300
Damn, this cigarette is good!

570
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:25,480
Real tobacco hard to find.

571
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:29,510
G- G-Go to hell.

572
01:14:32,190 --> 01:14:36,180
Damn, Garces. We catch one
and he turns out to be a stutterer.

573
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:38,580
We'll be here all night.

574
01:14:38,790 --> 01:14:40,760
As long as he talks.

575
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:48,460
Garces is right.

576
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:51,600
You'd do better
to tell us everything.

577
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:55,670
But to make sure it happens,
I brought along a few tools.

578
01:14:58,010 --> 01:15:00,210
Just things you pick up
along the way.

579
01:15:00,410 --> 01:15:02,850
At first,
I won't be able to trust you...

580
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:06,880
...but after I use this,
you'll own up to a few things.

581
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,390
When we get to these...

582
01:15:11,430 --> 01:15:15,090
...we'll have developed...
How can I put this...?

583
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:18,090
A closer bond,
much like brothers.

584
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:21,060
You'll see.

585
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:24,730
And when we get to this one...

586
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:28,540
...I'll believe anything you tell me.

587
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:42,150
I'll make you a deal.

588
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:45,750
If you can count to three
without st-t-tuttering...

589
01:15:46,090 --> 01:15:47,290
...you can go.

590
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:52,400
Don't look at him, look at me.

591
01:15:52,670 --> 01:15:54,430
Above me, there's no one.

592
01:15:54,970 --> 01:15:56,870
- Garces!
- Yes, Captain?

593
01:15:57,140 --> 01:16:00,660
If I say this asshole can leave,
would anybody contradict me?

594
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:02,370
No one, Captain.
He can leave.

595
01:16:03,110 --> 01:16:07,240
There you have it.
Count to three.

596
01:16:23,630 --> 01:16:26,260
- One.
- Good.

597
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:31,470
Two.

598
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:36,140
One more and you will be free.

599
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:54,030
Shame.

600
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:09,970
Your mother is much better,
Your Highness.

601
01:17:11,410 --> 01:17:17,480
Surely, you must be relieved.

602
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:20,080
Yes, thank you.

603
01:17:20,490 --> 01:17:23,950
But things haven't turned out so well.

604
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:25,950
No?

605
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:31,390
- I had an accident.
- An accident?

606
01:17:31,570 --> 01:17:32,530
Yes.

607
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:44,710
- You broke the rules!
- It was only two grapes!

608
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:46,400
I thought no one would notice.

609
01:17:47,810 --> 01:17:50,910
- We've made a mistake!
- A mistake?

610
01:17:51,650 --> 01:17:55,380
You failed.
You can never return.

611
01:17:55,490 --> 01:17:59,150
- It was an accident!
- You cannot return.

612
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:03,220
The moon will be full in three days.

613
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:09,500
Your spirit shall forever remain
among the humans.

614
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:13,470
You shall age like them,
you shall die like them...

615
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:17,640
...and all memory of you
shall fade in time.

616
01:18:18,210 --> 01:18:22,210
And we'll vanish along with it.

617
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:26,650
You will never see us again.

618
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:41,100
Good day, doctor.
Sorry to wake you so early...

619
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,560
...but I think we need your help.

620
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:08,450
My God, what have you done to him?

621
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:09,760
Not much.

622
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:13,500
But things are getting better.

623
01:19:21,410 --> 01:19:26,140
I like having you handy, Doctor.
It has its advantages.

624
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:29,150
Serrano, stay here.

625
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:30,370
I talked.

626
01:19:31,790 --> 01:19:33,010
Not much.

627
01:19:35,390 --> 01:19:38,830
- B-b-but I talked.
- I'm sorry.

628
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,150
I'm so sorry.

629
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:53,430
Kill me.
Kill me now, please.

630
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:11,220
Son of a bitch.

631
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:34,250
It'll take away the pain.

632
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:42,090
It's almost over.

633
01:20:50,830 --> 01:20:52,160
Watch Dr. Ferreiro...

634
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:53,770
- ...I'll be right there.
- Yes, Captain.

635
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:18,920
You're not moving anymore.

636
01:21:20,430 --> 01:21:21,860
Are you sick?

637
01:21:25,070 --> 01:21:27,590
What are you doing down there?

638
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:42,840
- Call him!
- Who?

639
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:45,350
Who else, you imbecile?
Ferreiro!

640
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,540
What the hell is this?

641
01:22:14,610 --> 01:22:16,210
No! No, no!

642
01:22:16,450 --> 01:22:20,050
Leave her.
Leave her alone, please!

643
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:24,320
Look at this! Look what she
was hiding under your bed!

644
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:25,920
What do you think of this?

645
01:22:30,530 --> 01:22:35,020
Ofelia, what is this thing doing
under the bed?

646
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:39,170
It's a magic root
the faun gave me.

647
01:22:39,340 --> 01:22:41,930
This is all because of that junk
you let her read.

648
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:43,240
Look what you've done!

649
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:47,440
Please, leave us alone.
I'll talk to her, darling.

650
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:51,020
Fine.
As you wish.

651
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:55,520
He told me you would get better.
And you did.

652
01:22:55,790 --> 01:22:58,690
Ofelia, you have to listen
to your father.

653
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:01,120
You have to stop all this.

654
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:04,420
No. I want to leave this place!

655
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:07,930
Please, take me away from here!
Let's just go, Please!

656
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:10,370
Things are not that simple.

657
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:14,440
You're getting older...

658
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:18,840
...soon you'll see that life
isn't like your fairy tales.

659
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:21,640
The world is a cruel place.

660
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:26,750
And you'll learn that,
even if it hurts.

661
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:30,880
- No! No!
- Ofelia!

662
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:37,190
Magic does not exist.
Not for you, me or anyone else.

663
01:23:49,010 --> 01:23:51,270
Mom! Help!

664
01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:53,180
Help!

665
01:23:54,050 --> 01:23:55,310
Help!

666
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:02,320
Why did you do it?

667
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:06,320
It was the only thing I could do.

668
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:09,890
No. You could have obeyed me.

669
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:13,930
I could have, but I didn't.

670
01:24:15,870 --> 01:24:18,390
It would have been better for you.
You know it.

671
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:22,780
I don't understand.
Why didn't you obey me?

672
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:29,210
To obey-just like that-for the sake
of obeying, without questioning...

673
01:24:30,950 --> 01:24:33,940
...that's something only people
like you can do, Captain.

674
01:25:11,390 --> 01:25:12,720
Captain!

675
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:21,400
Garces! Call the troop paramedic.

676
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,090
- Get up immediately!
- Yes, Captain.

677
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:00,600
Your wife is dead.

678
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:13,780
<i>Because the paths to the Lord
are inscrutable.</i>

679
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:16,120
<i>Because the essence
of His forgiveness</i>

680
01:26:16,190 --> 01:26:19,520
<i>lies in His word
and in His mystery.</i>

681
01:26:20,390 --> 01:26:23,390
<i>Because although God
sends us the message...</i>

682
01:26:23,530 --> 01:26:26,160
<i>...it is our task to decipher it.</i>

683
01:26:27,030 --> 01:26:28,860
<i>Because when we open our arms...</i>

684
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:33,900
<i>...the earth takes in only a hollow
and senseless shell.</i>

685
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:38,210
<i>Far away now is the soul
in its eternal glory.</i>

686
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:42,480
<i>Because it is in pain
that we find the meaning of life.</i>

687
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:46,220
<i>And the state of grace
that we lose when we are born.</i>

688
01:26:47,550 --> 01:26:52,820
<i>Because God, in His infinite wisdom,
puts the solution in our hands.</i>

689
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:59,390
<i>And because it is only
in His physical absence...</i>

690
01:26:59,570 --> 01:27:03,830
<i>...that the place He occupies
in our souls is reaffirmed.</i>

691
01:27:25,790 --> 01:27:29,280
You knew Dr. Ferreiro pretty
well, didn't you, Mercedes?

692
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:33,300
We all knew him, sir.
Everyone around here.

693
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:38,900
The stutterer spoke of an informer.
Here... at the mill.

694
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:43,940
Can you imagine?
Right under my nose.

695
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:49,220
Mercedes, please.

696
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,390
What must you think of me?

697
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:03,250
You must think that
I'm a monster.

698
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:06,700
It doesn't matter
what someone like me thinks, sir.

699
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:19,780
I want you to the storehouse
and bring me some more liquor, please.

700
01:28:20,050 --> 01:28:23,240
Yes, sir.
Goodnight, sir.

701
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:27,780
Mercedes,
aren't you forgetting something?

702
01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:29,810
Sir?

703
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:35,760
The key.

704
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:39,130
I do have the only copy, don't I?

705
01:28:40,330 --> 01:28:41,320
Yes, sir.

706
01:28:42,870 --> 01:28:46,860
You know, there's an odd detail
that's been bothering me.

707
01:28:47,210 --> 01:28:49,140
Maybe it's not important, but...

708
01:28:49,410 --> 01:28:51,000
...the day they broke into
the storehouse...

709
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:53,580
...with all those grenades
and explosives...

710
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:55,970
...the lock itself wasn't forced.

711
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:01,880
As I said, it's probably
not important.

712
01:29:05,490 --> 01:29:06,790
Be very careful.

713
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:10,120
Good night, sir.

714
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:55,740
Ofelia, Ofelia!

715
01:29:56,010 --> 01:29:58,030
Ofelia, I'm leaving tonight.

716
01:29:58,580 --> 01:30:02,070
- Where to?
- I can't tell you. I can't tell you...

717
01:30:02,180 --> 01:30:05,210
- Take me with you.
- No, no. I can't.

718
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:08,340
I can't, my child. But I'll come
back for you, I promise.

719
01:30:08,490 --> 01:30:09,610
Take me with you.

720
01:30:34,510 --> 01:30:35,810
I heard something.

721
01:30:40,790 --> 01:30:43,950
It's nothing, don't worry.

722
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:54,290
Mercedes.

723
01:30:56,470 --> 01:30:57,440
Ofelia.

724
01:31:06,450 --> 01:31:08,070
How long have
you known about her?

725
01:31:13,490 --> 01:31:15,040
How long have you been
laughing at me?

726
01:31:15,290 --> 01:31:16,480
Little bitch!

727
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:19,090
Watch her!

728
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,290
And if anyone tries to get in...

729
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:26,860
...kill her first.

730
01:31:41,180 --> 01:31:42,150
Dry meat.

731
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:46,740
Tobacco.

732
01:31:48,050 --> 01:31:50,820
If you had asked for it, I would have
given this to you, Mercedes.

733
01:31:58,030 --> 01:32:00,260
I want the names of whoever
wrote these letters.

734
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,160
And I want them
in front of me, tomorrow.

735
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:05,560
Yes, Captain.

736
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:09,910
You can go, Garces.

737
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:12,880
You're sure, Captain?

738
01:32:15,310 --> 01:32:18,080
For God's sake,
she's just a woman.

739
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:24,220
That's what you've always thought.

740
01:32:25,390 --> 01:32:28,190
That's why I was able to get away with it.

741
01:32:28,430 --> 01:32:33,090
- I was invisible to you.
- Damn.

742
01:32:33,930 --> 01:32:37,730
You've found my weakness:
Pride.

743
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:42,470
But it's your weak points
we're interested in.

744
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:47,780
It's very simple:
You will talk...

745
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:50,510
...and I have to know...

746
01:32:52,490 --> 01:32:53,780
...that everything you say is the truth.

747
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:59,290
We have a few things here
strictly for that purpose.

748
01:33:01,230 --> 01:33:02,490
Nothing complicated.

749
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:06,860
Things we learn on the job.

750
01:33:08,970 --> 01:33:10,940
At first...

751
01:33:28,050 --> 01:33:31,290
I'm not some old man!
Not a wounded prisoner!

752
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:35,420
Mother Fucker!
Don't you dare touch the girl?

753
01:33:35,660 --> 01:33:37,420
Won't be the first pig I gutted.

754
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:02,010
Look! He let her go.

755
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:05,820
The fuck did you say?

756
01:34:13,830 --> 01:34:16,530
Get her!
Come on! Bring her to me!

757
01:34:16,970 --> 01:34:18,800
Bring her to me, damn it!

758
01:34:18,940 --> 01:34:20,430
Mount up!

759
01:35:23,370 --> 01:35:25,860
It'll be better if you come
with me without struggling.

760
01:35:26,510 --> 01:35:28,530
The Captain said that if you behave...

761
01:35:33,180 --> 01:35:34,940
Don't be a fool, sweetheart.

762
01:35:35,310 --> 01:35:36,870
If anyone's going to kill you...

763
01:35:38,990 --> 01:35:40,180
...I'd rather it be me.

764
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:55,490
I've decided to give you
one last chance.

765
01:37:00,770 --> 01:37:02,460
Do you promise to do what I say?

766
01:37:04,470 --> 01:37:08,700
Will you do everything I tell you,
without question?

767
01:37:10,510 --> 01:37:13,480
This is your last chance.

768
01:37:14,610 --> 01:37:17,740
Then listen to me.

769
01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:20,580
Fetch your brother...

770
01:37:20,990 --> 01:37:23,650
...and bring him to the labyrinth...

771
01:37:23,790 --> 01:37:28,190
...as quickly as you can, Your Highness.

772
01:37:28,430 --> 01:37:29,760
My brother?

773
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,330
We need him.

774
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:34,520
- But...
- No more questions.

775
01:37:37,540 --> 01:37:39,090
The door's locked.

776
01:37:40,110 --> 01:37:46,010
In that case,
create your own door.

777
01:40:34,650 --> 01:40:36,080
Captain, with your permission.

778
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:40,480
Come quickly.

779
01:40:41,250 --> 01:40:44,520
- Now what?
- Serrano is back. He's wounded.

780
01:40:45,490 --> 01:40:46,860
Wounded?

781
01:41:33,070 --> 01:41:34,470
Where's Garces?

782
01:41:41,950 --> 01:41:42,940
How many were there?

783
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:45,710
I don't know exactly, Captain.

784
01:41:46,150 --> 01:41:47,640
Fifty men, at least.

785
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:51,350
The rest of the men didn't make it.
Our watch posts are not responding.

786
01:41:51,490 --> 01:41:55,090
- How many men we have left?
- Twenty, maybe less, sir.

787
01:42:05,900 --> 01:42:09,270
We're leaving.
Together.

788
01:42:10,310 --> 01:42:11,570
Don't be afraid.

789
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:14,110
Nothing is going to happen to you.

790
01:42:20,490 --> 01:42:22,110
Put them on picket duty
at the tree line.

791
01:42:22,250 --> 01:42:24,380
If the rest of the squad gets back,
have it report immediately to me.

792
01:42:24,620 --> 01:42:28,120
Radio for reinforcements, now.

793
01:42:28,290 --> 01:42:29,590
Yes, Captain.

794
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:57,650
Leave him!

795
01:43:43,740 --> 01:43:45,000
Ofelia!

796
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:14,850
Quickly, Your Majesty.

797
01:45:15,130 --> 01:45:17,650
Give him to me.

798
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:21,290
The full moon is high in the sky...

799
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:24,230
...we can open the portal.

800
01:45:25,140 --> 01:45:26,760
Why is that in your hand?

801
01:45:28,270 --> 01:45:33,180
The portal will only open
if we offer the blood of an innocent.

802
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:37,920
Just a drop of blood.
A pinprick, that's all.

803
01:45:38,020 --> 01:45:40,610
It's the final task.

804
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:42,250
Hurry.

805
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:48,050
You promised to obey me!

806
01:45:48,490 --> 01:45:50,720
- Give me the boy!
- No!

807
01:45:51,330 --> 01:45:53,460
My brother stays with me.

808
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:59,600
You would give up your sacred rights
for this brat you barely know?

809
01:45:59,670 --> 01:46:02,470
Yes, I would.

810
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:06,240
You would give up
your throne for him?

811
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:10,970
He who has caused you
such misery, such humiliation?

812
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:14,380
Yes, I would.

813
01:46:18,490 --> 01:46:24,190
As you wish, Your Highness.

814
01:46:39,910 --> 01:46:40,940
No!

815
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:40,630
My son.

816
01:48:08,230 --> 01:48:09,890
Tell my son...

817
01:48:15,740 --> 01:48:17,830
Tell him what time his father died.

818
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:19,940
- Tell him that I...
- No.

819
01:48:21,150 --> 01:48:22,910
He won't even know your name.

820
01:50:05,750 --> 01:50:07,780
Arise, my daughter.

821
01:50:11,090 --> 01:50:12,350
Come.

822
01:50:38,580 --> 01:50:39,810
Father.

823
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:43,950
You have spilled your own blood
rather than that of an innocent.

824
01:50:44,720 --> 01:50:48,560
That was the final task,
and the most important.

825
01:50:59,070 --> 01:51:04,340
And you chose well,
Your Highness.

826
01:51:04,580 --> 01:51:06,240
Come here with me...

827
01:51:07,110 --> 01:51:09,240
...and sit by your father's side.

828
01:51:09,710 --> 01:51:11,910
He's been waiting for you so long.

829
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:08,600
<i>And it is said the princess
returned to her father's kingdom.</i>

830
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:14,880
<i>That she reigned there with justice
and a kind heart for many centuries.</i>

831
01:52:15,780 --> 01:52:18,040
<i>That she was loved by her people.</i>

832
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:23,020
<i>And that she left behind
small traces of her time on earth...</i>

833
01:52:23,950 --> 01:52:28,850
<i>...visible only to those
who know where to look.</i>
