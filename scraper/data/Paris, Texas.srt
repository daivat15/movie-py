1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Greetings from Martin's Cult Movies.

2
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,276
What the hell?

3
00:05:06,198 --> 00:05:07,324
Hey.

4
00:05:13,404 --> 00:05:15,824
You know which side of the border
you are on?

5
00:05:16,825 --> 00:05:18,241
You got a name for it?

6
00:05:20,285 --> 00:05:25,748
Guess... someone must
have cut your tongue off.

7
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:29,626
Either that, or...

8
00:05:32,253 --> 00:05:34,297
Or has something.

9
00:05:35,673 --> 00:05:37,008
To hide.

10
00:05:40,928 --> 00:05:42,346
As far as I can tell...

11
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,682
You hear me plain enough.

12
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,360
Walter Henderson.

13
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,115
Now I want to ask you one last question.

14
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,992
You see this here card?

15
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,536
Is this you?

16
00:06:13,663 --> 00:06:15,332
Or a relative of yours?

17
00:06:18,793 --> 00:06:21,630
Well, I'm going to call up this number.

18
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:25,215
And see if they can tell me who you are.

19
00:06:25,591 --> 00:06:29,178
I ain't got beds enough to be putting up mutes.

20
00:06:37,392 --> 00:06:41,356
Operator. I need a line out please.

21
00:06:57,329 --> 00:06:58,413
What?

22
00:06:59,164 --> 00:07:03,166
What, can you... can you tell me
the exact location of your hospital down there?

23
00:07:05,794 --> 00:07:07,087
Where the hell is that?

24
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:10,340
Oh, OK, alright.

25
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:14,509
Yeah, OK, I'll be there as fast as I can.

26
00:07:15,176 --> 00:07:17,470
Just, will you tell him that I'm coming, OK?

27
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:18,763
OK.

28
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:27,144
Steven, I think you will have to change that...

29
00:07:27,436 --> 00:07:29,855
- This section right here?
- Yeah, because it's incomplete.

30
00:07:30,064 --> 00:07:31,524
Ann, honey?

31
00:07:33,317 --> 00:07:35,403
I just got the strangest phone call.

32
00:07:35,778 --> 00:07:36,821
Who from?

33
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:40,782
From some hospital in south Texas.
A place called Terlingua.

34
00:07:42,324 --> 00:07:44,243
They say they found Travis.

35
00:07:44,743 --> 00:07:45,869
Oh, no.

36
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:48,414
What are you going to do?

37
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:50,622
Well, I'll go down and get him.

38
00:07:51,123 --> 00:07:52,040
Oh, wow.

39
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:54,793
Well, what am I going to do?
I can't leave him down there.

40
00:07:58,297 --> 00:07:59,674
What about Hunter?

41
00:08:00,215 --> 00:08:02,301
What am I supposed to tell him?

42
00:08:02,676 --> 00:08:05,469
Well, just tell him
I had to go on a business trip.

43
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,555
I mean about Travis.

44
00:08:16,271 --> 00:08:18,398
I guess you better tell him the truth.

45
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,793
Ten to Vanhorn 90...

46
00:08:43,836 --> 00:08:45,838
The Alpine 118 south.

47
00:08:48,382 --> 00:08:49,550
Terlingua.

48
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:23,036
You must be the brother of the mute.

49
00:09:24,412 --> 00:09:26,248
- Mute?
- Yeah.

50
00:09:27,624 --> 00:09:31,002
I couldn't squeeze the time of day out of him.

51
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,005
Must be in a kind of jam.

52
00:09:36,756 --> 00:09:39,301
I don't know, I haven't seen him
in over 4 years.

53
00:09:40,302 --> 00:09:41,512
Is that right?

54
00:09:42,763 --> 00:09:47,015
Well, a lot can happen
to a man in 4 years.

55
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:49,601
All kinds of trouble.

56
00:09:50,602 --> 00:09:51,895
Bits of trouble.

57
00:09:52,604 --> 00:09:53,397
What do you mean?

58
00:09:53,855 --> 00:09:54,939
Well, down here,

59
00:09:56,148 --> 00:09:58,984
A man gets himself into a fix sometimes.

60
00:09:59,734 --> 00:10:01,945
It costs him a little to get him out.

61
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:03,905
If you understand what I mean.

62
00:10:05,865 --> 00:10:07,410
I don't understand you.

63
00:10:07,785 --> 00:10:10,496
I wish you get to the point,
because I'd like to see my brother.

64
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:13,873
Alright son.

65
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,127
But first I would like to ask you something.

66
00:10:18,086 --> 00:10:22,257
Did your brother ever get himself
into a car wreck?

67
00:10:27,135 --> 00:10:28,386
Car wreck, no...

68
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,263
Not that I know of.

69
00:10:31,306 --> 00:10:34,181
Then he must be mixing
with some hard company.

70
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:38,602
I'd like to see my brother now.
If you don't mind...

71
00:10:39,936 --> 00:10:41,146
He disappeared.

72
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,232
You mean he's not here?

73
00:10:43,941 --> 00:10:45,651
After I came all this way?

74
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:48,904
He's been gone since early this morning.

75
00:10:50,614 --> 00:10:53,824
We have his possessions.
Never the less...

76
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:55,618
Saved them.

77
00:10:57,494 --> 00:10:59,830
We'd be glad to turn him over to you.

78
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:04,499
Soon, as you take care of our little reward.

79
00:12:42,168 --> 00:12:43,377
Travis, hey!

80
00:12:47,881 --> 00:12:50,425
Don't you recognize me? It's Walt!

81
00:12:58,765 --> 00:13:00,183
It's your brother, Walt.

82
00:13:19,117 --> 00:13:20,784
What the hell happened to you, anyway?

83
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:22,536
You look like 40 miles of rough road.

84
00:13:33,421 --> 00:13:35,381
Come on, let's get in the car. Trav?

85
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:37,759
Come on...

86
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:33,641
Here Trav, here's your stuff.

87
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:37,561
Got that back at that clinic back there.

88
00:14:39,604 --> 00:14:41,313
Sure picked a hell of a spot to land in.

89
00:14:41,605 --> 00:14:43,858
I don't blame you for running out of it.

90
00:14:50,696 --> 00:14:51,738
Look, Trav...

91
00:14:52,781 --> 00:14:54,533
We've got quite a bit of traveling to do here,

92
00:14:54,616 --> 00:14:56,910
You're not going to clam up
the whole way, are you?

93
00:14:57,953 --> 00:14:59,662
I'm going to get kinda lonely.

94
00:15:04,457 --> 00:15:05,418
Trav?

95
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:11,215
Would you mind telling me
where you disappeared to for the last 4 years?

96
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:19,220
Have you seen Jane, or talked to her?

97
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,058
Ann and I are...

98
00:15:24,934 --> 00:15:26,769
We sort of gave up on you. We actually...

99
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,729
We thought you were dead, boy.

100
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:07,345
This is pretty a...

101
00:16:18,647 --> 00:16:19,898
You OK?

102
00:16:29,074 --> 00:16:29,741
Well...

103
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,913
Well, gee Trav, maybe you want to...

104
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,916
Clean up. Take a shower or something?

105
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,546
I think I'll go back into town
and get you some new cloths.

106
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,379
You could use a new set of cloths, couldn't you?

107
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,050
What size shoes do you wear?

108
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:53,927
Lets see...

109
00:16:57,764 --> 00:16:59,432
I'm probably one size bigger, huh?

110
00:17:02,143 --> 00:17:03,645
So, where did you find that beard?

111
00:17:05,188 --> 00:17:06,147
It's pretty snazzy.

112
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:13,528
OK, I'll zip into town and zip right back.

113
00:17:15,155 --> 00:17:16,365
I won't be gone long.

114
00:17:24,413 --> 00:17:25,622
You'll be OK, won't you, Trav?

115
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:30,711
OK, I'll be right back.

116
00:19:23,432 --> 00:19:24,183
Damn it.

117
00:20:23,318 --> 00:20:25,236
You mind telling me
where you are headed, Trav?

118
00:20:29,991 --> 00:20:30,950
What's out there?

119
00:20:38,207 --> 00:20:39,541
There's nothing out there.

120
00:20:42,794 --> 00:20:44,629
Don't you trust me or something?

121
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,468
I'm just trying to help you Trav, that's all.

122
00:20:56,848 --> 00:20:58,182
Come on, it's alright.

123
00:20:59,016 --> 00:21:00,351
Come on with me in the car.

124
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:09,952
Feels good to be in new cloths, huh?

125
00:22:34,474 --> 00:22:36,641
Hi, Hunter? It's Daddy.

126
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:39,768
I thought you'd be in bed already.

127
00:22:41,604 --> 00:22:44,816
Guess who I'm visiting, here in Texas.

128
00:22:47,527 --> 00:22:48,487
Your father.

129
00:22:49,488 --> 00:22:50,906
Do you remember your father?

130
00:22:53,491 --> 00:22:54,492
Not at all?

131
00:22:57,911 --> 00:22:58,912
He was?

132
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,165
Well, guess what?

133
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,792
I'm going to bring him home to visit.

134
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,056
Travis.

135
00:23:25,226 --> 00:23:28,562
Do you remember your little boy?
Hunter?

136
00:23:31,898 --> 00:23:33,149
Well, he's with us.

137
00:23:34,274 --> 00:23:37,319
He's been living with Ann and me
ever since you disappeared.

138
00:23:39,238 --> 00:23:40,864
We didn't know what else to do.

139
00:23:41,198 --> 00:23:42,783
So, we just kept him.

140
00:23:44,867 --> 00:23:47,620
One day, he was just standing at the door.

141
00:23:48,705 --> 00:23:52,417
All he could tell us was that
someone brought him there in a car.

142
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,336
He didn't know what had happened to you,

143
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:57,170
Or Jane.

144
00:23:57,671 --> 00:24:00,966
So we tried everything we could
think of to find you, or Jane.

145
00:24:01,883 --> 00:24:03,969
Tried to locate her, she vanished too.

146
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:07,764
We didn't know what else to do.

147
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:14,519
Travis,

148
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:17,480
I don't know what kind of trouble
you got into.

149
00:24:18,648 --> 00:24:20,316
I don't know what happened.

150
00:24:21,984 --> 00:24:24,862
But damn it, I'm your brother man.

151
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,031
You can talk to me.

152
00:24:31,367 --> 00:24:34,411
I'm tired of doing all the taking.

153
00:25:17,364 --> 00:25:18,908
Fill it with unleaded please.

154
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:24,704
You know, I'm getting a little sick
with this silence routine.

155
00:25:25,747 --> 00:25:26,957
You can talk.

156
00:25:36,508 --> 00:25:38,633
I can be silent too you know.

157
00:25:41,761 --> 00:25:44,180
I just assumed that if we kept
our mouths shut for the rest of the trip.

158
00:25:44,222 --> 00:25:46,057
- Paris.
- What?

159
00:25:49,184 --> 00:25:50,142
Paris.

160
00:25:56,107 --> 00:25:57,108
Paris?

161
00:25:58,317 --> 00:25:59,318
Paris?

162
00:26:01,655 --> 00:26:02,822
Did you ever go to Paris?

163
00:26:05,241 --> 00:26:06,074
No.

164
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,743
Could we go there now?

165
00:26:11,538 --> 00:26:13,123
It's a little out of the way.

166
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:19,377
Ah, I've never even been to Europe.

167
00:26:19,752 --> 00:26:21,170
Ann keeps on wanting to go there.

168
00:26:22,004 --> 00:26:24,257
Cus, she is from France, you remember?

169
00:26:25,047 --> 00:26:26,507
But we never seem to find the time,

170
00:26:26,841 --> 00:26:29,384
Because my company kinda keeps me busy.

171
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,941
Lets go Trav.

172
00:26:49,403 --> 00:26:50,404
What's the matter?

173
00:26:51,113 --> 00:26:52,197
Where are we going?

174
00:26:52,531 --> 00:26:53,905
We're going to fly to L.A.

175
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,324
You're not afraid of flying, are you?

176
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,786
- Leaving the ground?
- Yeah.

177
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,080
Why?

178
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:04,206
Because it's too far to drive.

179
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:06,876
It would take an extra 2 days,
I can't afford the time, Trav.

180
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,377
Why?

181
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:13,800
It's just easier to fly, Trav.
It's faster. Come on.

182
00:27:33,232 --> 00:27:34,734
It's all OK.

183
00:27:35,276 --> 00:27:38,155
When I get you home, I'll get you settled
and then you can do whatever you want.

184
00:27:39,281 --> 00:27:42,867
But sir, we can't stop the plane
whenever someone gets terrified.

185
00:27:43,034 --> 00:27:45,827
Don't get on a plane and then
refuse to leave the ground.

186
00:27:46,495 --> 00:27:48,955
Don't do things like that,
this isn't the wilderness.

187
00:27:49,873 --> 00:27:51,374
You're living with people now.

188
00:27:52,209 --> 00:27:55,670
You should have acquired a private plane,
do you know how many people you are detaining?

189
00:27:55,962 --> 00:27:57,129
Sorry!

190
00:27:57,296 --> 00:27:59,924
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! OK?

191
00:28:02,758 --> 00:28:05,302
This is getting a little ridiculous Travis.

192
00:28:07,012 --> 00:28:08,472
Are you going to leave me?

193
00:28:09,389 --> 00:28:11,390
No, I'm not going to leave you.

194
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:14,685
It's alright if you leave me.

195
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:19,356
I don't know honey, no...
He just panicked or something.

196
00:28:21,108 --> 00:28:23,776
Well, it won't do any good to try
another plane, it wasn't the plane,

197
00:28:23,984 --> 00:28:25,486
he'll just get off again.

198
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:29,532
Well, we're just going to
have to drive it, that's all.

199
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:31,826
Yeah, it'll take a good 2 days.

200
00:28:35,829 --> 00:28:39,123
I don't understand why you have to
have the exact same car you had before.

201
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:40,791
They are all alike.

202
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:42,876
All the cars we have here are Birds,

203
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:45,171
Olds, Chevy's, and whatever.

204
00:28:45,505 --> 00:28:48,131
- I'm not even sure I can locate the same car...
- I know...

205
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:52,885
My brother left something in the car,
we are hoping we can search the car and find it.

206
00:28:53,219 --> 00:28:56,347
Oh, well, I'll just contact the lost
and found department for you, if that's OK sir.

207
00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:58,432
No, we have to have the very same car.

208
00:28:58,974 --> 00:29:01,809
Well, I can't do that.
There is no way I can trace the car for you.

209
00:29:02,184 --> 00:29:04,770
Well, why not?
You have the license number
right on your form there.

210
00:29:04,854 --> 00:29:07,356
- Well, yes but...
- Well, just give us the license number
and we'll find it.

211
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,984
But I can't allow you on the lot sir.

212
00:29:11,235 --> 00:29:12,611
Why not? We're already on it!

213
00:29:12,945 --> 00:29:15,530
I just have to ask you
to come back to the office with me.

214
00:29:18,533 --> 00:29:21,077
- Travis!
- What?

215
00:29:22,078 --> 00:29:24,456
I don't think we're going to get the very same car.

216
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:27,915
But I can rent you a model
just like the one you had before, sir.

217
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:32,086
I need the same car Walt.
How are we going to go in another car?

218
00:29:33,921 --> 00:29:35,838
Give us the number, will you, please?

219
00:29:37,131 --> 00:29:38,715
Come on... pretty please?

220
00:29:40,675 --> 00:29:44,304
Alright, that number is 667DJP.

221
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:46,806
You remember that? 667DJP?

222
00:29:47,307 --> 00:29:49,435
- It's got a bump on the hood.
- Yes it does...

223
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,239
What's that?

224
00:30:06,615 --> 00:30:07,532
What?

225
00:30:08,116 --> 00:30:09,201
That, what you got in your hand?

226
00:30:10,827 --> 00:30:11,912
A picture.

227
00:30:12,245 --> 00:30:13,704
A picture of what?

228
00:30:14,371 --> 00:30:15,873
A picture of...

229
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:19,417
Paris.

230
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:21,962
Paris, really?

231
00:30:22,463 --> 00:30:24,673
Yes, picture of a piece of Paris.

232
00:30:25,007 --> 00:30:26,967
Where did you get a picture of Paris?

233
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:29,053
- Can I see it?
- Yes.

234
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:33,305
This is it?
This is Paris?

235
00:30:34,224 --> 00:30:36,059
Looks just like Texas to me.

236
00:30:36,226 --> 00:30:37,602
It is.

237
00:30:37,977 --> 00:30:39,687
Paris, Texas?

238
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:41,731
It's right here on the map.

239
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,356
There's really a place called Paris, Texas?

240
00:30:43,523 --> 00:30:45,024
It's right here.

241
00:30:47,777 --> 00:30:50,696
Well, how come you got a picture
of a vacant lot in Paris, Texas?

242
00:30:51,738 --> 00:30:52,823
It's mine.

243
00:30:53,657 --> 00:30:55,992
I know that, but how come you got it?

244
00:30:56,868 --> 00:31:00,455
I purchased it in the mail...

245
00:31:01,123 --> 00:31:02,416
A long time ago.

246
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:05,752
You bought a picture
of vacant lot in the mail?

247
00:31:06,086 --> 00:31:08,129
No, I bought the land...

248
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,754
- Oh, you bought that lot.
- Yes.

249
00:31:11,088 --> 00:31:12,131
Oh, let me see again.

250
00:31:14,925 --> 00:31:16,468
There's nothing on it.

251
00:31:17,845 --> 00:31:19,012
Empty.

252
00:31:20,097 --> 00:31:23,932
Well, why in hell would you want to buy
a vacant lot in Paris, Texas for Christ's sake?

253
00:31:34,442 --> 00:31:35,609
I forgot.

254
00:31:37,987 --> 00:31:38,863
Here Trav.

255
00:31:46,703 --> 00:31:49,621
Do you remember
what mama's very first name was?

256
00:31:50,456 --> 00:31:51,623
Marry.

257
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:56,754
No, I know, I mean, her...
before she found daddy.

258
00:31:57,171 --> 00:31:58,962
- Oh, her median name?
- Yeah.

259
00:31:59,881 --> 00:32:01,841
You don't remember her median name?

260
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,426
No...

261
00:32:04,552 --> 00:32:05,720
Sekinae.

262
00:32:07,138 --> 00:32:08,388
Sekinae.

263
00:32:08,722 --> 00:32:09,848
Spanish.

264
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,640
Her father was.

265
00:32:12,224 --> 00:32:13,309
Yeah?

266
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:20,608
I don't believe it.

267
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,778
You finally decided to eat!

268
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,738
Eating and talking!

269
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:30,824
Before you know it,
you will be back in the land of the living.

270
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,496
You want me to drive?

271
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,582
Sure! Think you remember how?

272
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,834
My body remembers.

273
00:32:47,421 --> 00:32:49,172
You can sleep while I drive.

274
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,383
OK.

275
00:33:06,397 --> 00:33:07,856
Well, Trav...

276
00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:10,651
I think maybe you are ready to...

277
00:33:11,652 --> 00:33:13,821
Tell me what the hell happened to you
over the last 4 years.

278
00:33:16,446 --> 00:33:17,698
No, not yet.

279
00:33:53,979 --> 00:33:54,938
Travis!

280
00:33:55,689 --> 00:33:56,481
What?

281
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:14,583
Where are we, Travis?
What happened?

282
00:34:16,752 --> 00:34:18,335
Why did we get off the high way.

283
00:34:19,378 --> 00:34:21,130
Jesus Christ...

284
00:34:21,253 --> 00:34:23,881
I can't even sleep for 5 minutes
without some crisis.

285
00:34:24,214 --> 00:34:25,549
Why did you turn off?

286
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:32,304
I don't know where I turned off.
Didn't have a name.

287
00:34:34,681 --> 00:34:35,974
That's great.

288
00:34:36,266 --> 00:34:37,934
That's just damn great.

289
00:34:38,185 --> 00:34:41,771
Where we are in the middle of the Mohabi desert
and a place that doesn't have a name.

290
00:34:44,231 --> 00:34:46,317
I could find the high way again.

291
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,045
Trav, I need to talk to you a little
about Hunter.

292
00:35:10,962 --> 00:35:12,589
How old is he now?

293
00:35:12,923 --> 00:35:15,550
He's eight in January.

294
00:35:16,511 --> 00:35:18,637
- She's seven then.
- Yeah.

295
00:35:20,681 --> 00:35:23,349
But see, what I want to talk about is...

296
00:35:24,934 --> 00:35:28,604
Well, he's like part of the family now.

297
00:35:30,606 --> 00:35:32,733
Ann and me are like his parents now.

298
00:35:34,317 --> 00:35:35,276
Ann's your wife.

299
00:35:35,902 --> 00:35:37,237
Yeah, you remember her, don't you?

300
00:35:38,028 --> 00:35:40,239
No... Does he think
that you're his father?

301
00:35:42,533 --> 00:35:46,078
Well, Ann told him you were coming.

302
00:35:48,203 --> 00:35:49,789
Well, who does he think I am?

303
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:54,419
I told him you are his father.

304
00:35:55,336 --> 00:35:56,794
But see,

305
00:35:58,254 --> 00:36:00,046
You've been gone a long time, Trav.

306
00:36:01,172 --> 00:36:02,841
How long have I been gone? Do you know?

307
00:36:04,676 --> 00:36:05,593
4 years.

308
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:09,305
Is 4 years a long time?

309
00:36:12,516 --> 00:36:14,309
It is for a little boy.

310
00:36:16,394 --> 00:36:17,353
It's half his life.

311
00:36:19,814 --> 00:36:21,567
Half a boy's life.

312
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,737
I remember now...

313
00:36:27,696 --> 00:36:28,572
What?

314
00:36:32,034 --> 00:36:33,702
Why I bought that land.

315
00:36:34,077 --> 00:36:35,411
Oh, why?

316
00:36:35,494 --> 00:36:38,788
Well, mama once told me that...

317
00:36:39,122 --> 00:36:41,666
That's where she and daddy first...

318
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,335
Made love.

319
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,046
Oh, in Paris, Texas?

320
00:36:47,422 --> 00:36:49,507
- Yeah.
- She told you that?

321
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:50,507
Yeah.

322
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:56,347
So... I thought that...

323
00:36:56,805 --> 00:36:59,183
that's where I began.

324
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,561
I mean me, Travis Calve Henderson.
They named me that.

325
00:37:05,771 --> 00:37:07,522
I started out there.

326
00:37:09,274 --> 00:37:12,194
- Paris Texas, huh?
- Yeah...

327
00:37:16,196 --> 00:37:18,448
So you think
maybe you were conceived there?

328
00:37:19,991 --> 00:37:21,076
Yeah.

329
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:22,870
You could be right, Travis.

330
00:37:25,206 --> 00:37:27,334
Daddy always had a joke about it.

331
00:37:28,418 --> 00:37:29,877
What was the joke?

332
00:37:31,045 --> 00:37:33,545
He's... he would introduce mama.

333
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:36,215
As the girl he met in Paris.

334
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,133
And then he would wait.

335
00:37:40,135 --> 00:37:43,220
Before he said Texas,
so everybody thought that...

336
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:46,515
He meant...
He would wait.

337
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:49,226
Before he said Texas
till everybody thought,

338
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:52,687
After everybody thought
that he was talking about Paris, France.

339
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,563
He always laughed real hard about it.

340
00:37:58,775 --> 00:38:00,611
So you live in Los Angles, huh?

341
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,114
Yeah, well we live in suburbs,

342
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,324
But I've got my business in town.

343
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,450
What's your business?

344
00:38:08,284 --> 00:38:10,536
I make billboard signs for advertisements.

345
00:38:11,704 --> 00:38:12,830
Oh, yeah?

346
00:38:13,872 --> 00:38:16,542
You're the one that makes all those...
I love those.

347
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:18,210
Some of them are beautiful.

348
00:38:18,544 --> 00:38:20,877
I'm not the only one in the world
that make's them, Trav.

349
00:38:44,899 --> 00:38:46,651
Trav? This way.

350
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:50,529
Nice, huh?
Just been in here 3 months.

351
00:38:50,904 --> 00:38:53,949
I really like it,
but I took a beating financing, I'll tell ya.

352
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:56,577
Like everybody else.

353
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:04,916
Hi baby.

354
00:39:06,627 --> 00:39:08,461
- Everything OK here?
- Oh, sure...

355
00:39:08,627 --> 00:39:10,795
We just miss you a lot.

356
00:39:10,795 --> 00:39:12,255
I missed you too.

357
00:39:13,548 --> 00:39:15,383
- Come on in.
- Travis.

358
00:39:20,388 --> 00:39:21,723
My God.

359
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:26,017
We were beginning to wonder
if we would ever see you again.

360
00:39:26,392 --> 00:39:28,061
It's been so long.

361
00:39:29,479 --> 00:39:31,022
Did you have a good trip?

362
00:39:31,648 --> 00:39:32,940
Yeah, it was fine.

363
00:39:36,609 --> 00:39:37,526
Hunter.

364
00:39:50,038 --> 00:39:51,039
Hunter.

365
00:39:51,873 --> 00:39:53,166
This is Travis.

366
00:40:07,595 --> 00:40:08,388
Hi.

367
00:40:11,517 --> 00:40:12,476
Hi.

368
00:40:22,484 --> 00:40:26,028
I bet it was really hot
coming across the Mohabis Desert.

369
00:40:29,197 --> 00:40:30,407
Yes.

370
00:40:30,865 --> 00:40:32,575
Too bad you had to drive.

371
00:40:33,618 --> 00:40:35,036
What happened?

372
00:40:36,204 --> 00:40:38,790
Well, Travis just didn't feel like flying.

373
00:40:39,581 --> 00:40:41,166
Oh, I don't blame you.

374
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:43,418
I can't stand airplanes anymore.

375
00:40:43,501 --> 00:40:45,336
Especially since we live in this house.

376
00:40:46,087 --> 00:40:49,300
All we hear is planes day in and day out.

377
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,467
I like them.

378
00:40:58,974 --> 00:41:01,018
You used to fly, didn't you, Travis?

379
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:04,853
No.

380
00:41:06,813 --> 00:41:10,150
Oh, I thought...
I remember

381
00:41:10,275 --> 00:41:14,237
Jane telling me
that you flew once to Dallas together.

382
00:41:14,863 --> 00:41:16,282
Or somewhere.

383
00:41:19,451 --> 00:41:20,743
Maybe I'm mistaken.

384
00:41:41,552 --> 00:41:44,054
Honey.
He hasn't slept in a bed.

385
00:41:44,429 --> 00:41:46,556
Since we started, I swear to God.

386
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,808
I don't think that's even necessary.

387
00:41:49,268 --> 00:41:51,312
Where has he been sleeping then?

388
00:41:51,646 --> 00:41:53,898
Well, he doesn't sleep.

389
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,483
He has to sleep somewhere.

390
00:41:56,983 --> 00:41:57,984
OK.

391
00:41:58,484 --> 00:42:00,736
But I don't think he's even going to use it.

392
00:42:01,195 --> 00:42:03,489
He's got to get tired sometime.

393
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:10,160
There is a towel for you, Travis,

394
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:13,080
And some underwear and socks from Walt.

395
00:42:15,248 --> 00:42:16,375
Good night.

396
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,626
Thank you.

397
00:42:24,464 --> 00:42:26,967
OK.
Get some shut eye.

398
00:42:27,592 --> 00:42:28,593
OK.

399
00:42:30,095 --> 00:42:31,221
- Sweet dreams.
- Alright.

400
00:43:41,281 --> 00:43:42,782
You polished them.

401
00:43:45,493 --> 00:43:47,495
That's very nice of you Travis.

402
00:43:49,331 --> 00:43:51,749
Would you like to come in
and have some breakfast?

403
00:43:54,207 --> 00:43:55,417
Aren't you hungry?

404
00:43:57,044 --> 00:43:59,379
We are going to have strawberry waffles.

405
00:44:00,214 --> 00:44:01,424
Do you like them?

406
00:44:02,798 --> 00:44:04,008
Do you want some?

407
00:44:13,893 --> 00:44:17,771
Well, there is hot coffee on the stove
if you want some.

408
00:44:20,815 --> 00:44:22,108
Look at that truck.

409
00:45:00,684 --> 00:45:01,810
Hi.

410
00:45:37,715 --> 00:45:39,467
Decided to rough it, huh?

411
00:45:39,634 --> 00:45:40,635
Yeah.

412
00:45:41,845 --> 00:45:43,555
What did you do, spit shine these?

413
00:45:43,971 --> 00:45:45,598
I can get you a job
at the airport doing that.

414
00:45:48,975 --> 00:45:51,894
Do you want to trade these new boots
for those old boots?

415
00:45:53,021 --> 00:45:54,230
You can wear them.

416
00:45:56,814 --> 00:45:57,898
Thank you.

417
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:30,053
Travis? I have to rush off
to get Hunter to school on time.

418
00:46:30,428 --> 00:46:32,221
We will be back this afternoon.

419
00:46:32,597 --> 00:46:35,473
Walt's office number is
on the dining room table.

420
00:46:36,265 --> 00:46:37,266
See you later.

421
00:46:38,267 --> 00:46:39,894
- OK.
- Bye.

422
00:47:14,047 --> 00:47:15,632
- Ann?
- Yeah?

423
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,928
I was just thinking
maybe I can meet Hunter after school.

424
00:47:19,011 --> 00:47:21,389
And we could walk home together,
if he wants to.

425
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:24,391
That sounds like a great idea, Travis.

426
00:47:26,392 --> 00:47:29,853
Walk home?
I don't want to walk home mom.

427
00:47:31,188 --> 00:47:33,816
Why walk, everybody drives.

428
00:47:34,441 --> 00:47:35,693
Come on, Hunter.

429
00:47:35,693 --> 00:47:37,946
It won't hurt you
once to walk home in your life.

430
00:47:38,362 --> 00:47:40,155
No, no, I don't want to.

431
00:47:41,115 --> 00:47:44,200
Travis, I insist, you are Hunter's father.

432
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:49,832
And get into the car Hunter.
We are late as it is.

433
00:47:54,876 --> 00:47:56,044
You are mean.

434
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:01,643
- Can I come with you?
- Sure.

435
00:49:39,801 --> 00:49:42,095
I'm very sorry about this, Travis.

436
00:49:43,805 --> 00:49:45,680
It's not easy for him, Ann.

437
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:55,021
Ann, it's OK, he's in here.

438
00:50:03,655 --> 00:50:04,698
What are you doing?

439
00:50:05,282 --> 00:50:06,283
Driving.

440
00:50:07,325 --> 00:50:08,368
Where to?

441
00:50:09,744 --> 00:50:10,953
Just driving.

442
00:50:11,954 --> 00:50:13,664
You're not hiding out in there, are you?

443
00:50:14,288 --> 00:50:15,289
No.

444
00:50:20,961 --> 00:50:23,503
Hunter. Travis is your real dad,

445
00:50:23,628 --> 00:50:24,546
You know that, don't you?

446
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:29,426
Dad, when are they going to
make spaceships like they...

447
00:50:29,801 --> 00:50:31,261
Make cars?

448
00:50:33,805 --> 00:50:36,348
Hunter, I'm asking you a question.
Can you answer it?

449
00:50:37,349 --> 00:50:38,517
What?

450
00:50:41,937 --> 00:50:45,232
Well, Travis went to meet you at school,

451
00:50:45,524 --> 00:50:47,026
And he wanted to walk you home.

452
00:50:48,068 --> 00:50:49,694
Nobody walks.

453
00:50:51,154 --> 00:50:52,237
That's not the point.

454
00:50:53,614 --> 00:50:55,824
Travis is your real dad and...

455
00:50:56,158 --> 00:50:57,784
He wants to talk to you.

456
00:51:00,662 --> 00:51:02,622
Why? What about?

457
00:51:04,999 --> 00:51:06,919
OK, come on. Lets go have dinner.

458
00:51:17,969 --> 00:51:22,933
Hey Trav? Do you remember that time
when Ann and me came down
to visit you about 5 years ago?

459
00:51:26,186 --> 00:51:27,019
No.

460
00:51:27,978 --> 00:51:30,146
You and Jane were down in Texas,
right there on the coast.

461
00:51:31,314 --> 00:51:32,565
Hunter was about 3.

462
00:51:33,858 --> 00:51:34,901
Don't you remember that?

463
00:51:38,739 --> 00:51:39,738
No.

464
00:51:39,947 --> 00:51:41,949
I remember, we went fishing.

465
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,284
Yeah.

466
00:51:45,577 --> 00:51:47,871
I took some Super Eight on that trip.
And I put it all together?

467
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:49,579
Thought maybe you might
want to see some of it.

468
00:51:50,664 --> 00:51:51,790
What is it?

469
00:51:52,581 --> 00:51:54,041
Movies. You know, Super Eight?

470
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:56,418
- Oh.
- Walt.

471
00:51:57,169 --> 00:51:59,129
Maybe Travis doesn't want...

472
00:52:00,422 --> 00:52:01,340
What?

473
00:52:03,092 --> 00:52:06,594
Well, maybe he'd like to wait a while
before he looks at it.

474
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,888
Yeah, it's up to him.

475
00:52:10,597 --> 00:52:12,225
Just thought you might like to see some of it.

476
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,978
Movies? Sure.

477
00:52:15,228 --> 00:52:18,980
Great. There's some great stuff on it.
Some great shots of Hunter on it.

478
00:52:19,939 --> 00:52:21,148
I've already seen it.

479
00:52:21,816 --> 00:52:22,900
Well, you have to see it again.

480
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:26,696
- Come on, help me set up the projector.
- OK.

481
00:53:55,189 --> 00:53:56,482
That's me driving.

482
00:53:57,191 --> 00:53:58,859
I know, you are going to be good.

483
00:57:04,143 --> 00:57:05,855
Time for bed now, Hunter.

484
00:57:06,939 --> 00:57:09,024
Oh, mom.

485
00:57:09,275 --> 00:57:11,359
Time to go to bed, it's past ten.

486
00:57:13,861 --> 00:57:15,946
- Good night dad.
- Good night baby.

487
00:57:22,035 --> 00:57:23,410
Good night dad.

488
00:57:29,791 --> 00:57:31,710
Do you think he still loves her?

489
00:57:32,168 --> 00:57:34,128
How would I know that, Hunter?

490
00:57:35,253 --> 00:57:36,880
I think he does.

491
00:57:38,674 --> 00:57:39,800
How can you tell?

492
00:57:40,134 --> 00:57:41,927
Well, the way he looked at her.

493
00:57:42,511 --> 00:57:44,221
You mean when he saw her in the movie?

494
00:57:45,014 --> 00:57:47,349
Yeah, but that's not her.

495
00:57:48,016 --> 00:57:49,142
What do you mean?

496
00:57:50,769 --> 00:57:52,395
That's only her in a movie.

497
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:55,732
A long time ago.

498
00:57:57,108 --> 00:57:59,402
In a galaxy far, far away.

499
00:58:37,184 --> 00:58:38,352
What are you looking for?

500
00:58:38,934 --> 00:58:41,186
I'm looking for a...

501
00:58:42,562 --> 00:58:43,480
The father.

502
00:58:43,856 --> 00:58:44,816
Your father?

503
00:58:45,191 --> 00:58:48,151
No, no, just a father.
Any father.

504
00:58:48,527 --> 00:58:50,111
What does a father look like?

505
00:58:50,737 --> 00:58:52,822
There are many different kinds of fathers,
senior Travis.

506
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:55,616
Well, I just need one.

507
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:57,243
You think you are going to find him in there?

508
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:59,078
Well, I don't know where else to look.

509
00:58:59,787 --> 00:59:02,414
Oh, I see, you want too look like a father.

510
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:04,791
Yeah.

511
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:09,169
Tell me, do you want to be a rich father?

512
00:59:11,171 --> 00:59:12,130
No.

513
00:59:12,422 --> 00:59:14,049
- A poor one?
- No.

514
00:59:15,467 --> 00:59:16,636
Than which?

515
00:59:17,051 --> 00:59:17,969
In between.

516
00:59:17,969 --> 00:59:20,555
No, no. There is no in between, eh?

517
00:59:20,847 --> 00:59:22,932
You either have to be a rich father
or a poor one.

518
00:59:23,307 --> 00:59:24,600
Rich.

519
00:59:41,073 --> 00:59:42,657
One thing you must remember.

520
00:59:42,907 --> 00:59:46,659
To be a rich father, senior Travis,
you must look to the sky,

521
00:59:46,826 --> 00:59:48,161
Never to the ground.

522
00:59:50,414 --> 00:59:51,623
Little higher.

523
01:00:00,213 --> 01:00:02,048
No... Stand.

524
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:04,842
You must walk stiff, senior Travis.

525
01:00:14,392 --> 01:00:15,643
Dignity.

526
01:00:32,493 --> 01:00:33,700
You got it.

527
01:00:54,219 --> 01:00:56,263
Who is that guy, you know him?

528
01:00:57,264 --> 01:00:59,307
Yeah, he's my father's brother.

529
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:06,230
No... they are both brothers.

530
01:01:06,313 --> 01:01:09,566
No, they are both fathers.

531
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:13,860
No... ah, forget it.

532
01:01:14,236 --> 01:01:16,656
- But both who's fathers?
- My father.

533
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:19,325
How they have two fathers?

534
01:01:19,492 --> 01:01:21,033
Just lucky I guess.

535
01:01:22,701 --> 01:01:24,285
- Well, bye.
- Bye.

536
01:03:16,801 --> 01:03:18,134
That's my dad's suite.

537
01:03:20,053 --> 01:03:21,262
I mean Walt.

538
01:03:21,596 --> 01:03:23,515
That's OK if you call him dad.

539
01:03:24,682 --> 01:03:27,352
Yeah, I borrowed it from him.
He said it was OK.

540
01:03:33,107 --> 01:03:34,565
What are those pictures?

541
01:03:35,525 --> 01:03:36,859
That's my dad.

542
01:03:38,612 --> 01:03:40,030
And your grandfather.

543
01:03:43,907 --> 01:03:45,117
What was his name?

544
01:03:46,118 --> 01:03:47,202
Travis.

545
01:03:47,327 --> 01:03:48,912
Same as yours.

546
01:03:50,455 --> 01:03:51,498
Where is he now?

547
01:03:53,207 --> 01:03:54,500
He died...

548
01:03:55,417 --> 01:03:57,418
A couple of years after this picture.

549
01:03:58,086 --> 01:03:59,337
In that car.

550
01:03:59,712 --> 01:04:01,631
- Oh, he's dead?
- Uh huh.

551
01:04:03,216 --> 01:04:05,427
But can you feel that he's dead?

552
01:04:06,136 --> 01:04:07,262
What do you mean?

553
01:04:07,887 --> 01:04:09,513
You knew him
when he was walking around.

554
01:04:09,638 --> 01:04:12,266
- And talking. Right?
- Yeah.

555
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:15,102
So can you feel that he is gone?

556
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:19,565
Yeah, sometimes.
I know he's dead.

557
01:04:21,982 --> 01:04:23,942
I never felt like you were dead.

558
01:04:24,276 --> 01:04:25,777
I could always feel you were walking.

559
01:04:25,861 --> 01:04:28,989
Around and talking... some place.

560
01:04:29,781 --> 01:04:31,448
I feel mom too.

561
01:04:32,031 --> 01:04:34,241
- You do?
- Don't you?

562
01:04:35,576 --> 01:04:36,743
Yeah.

563
01:04:40,415 --> 01:04:42,125
That's me when I was in the navy.

564
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:44,628
You were a general?

565
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:48,173
No... This was when I was in the band.

566
01:04:48,965 --> 01:04:50,215
The high school band.

567
01:04:52,468 --> 01:04:56,013
This is you. I like this picture.
Look at that.

568
01:04:57,014 --> 01:04:58,015
That is really wild.

569
01:04:58,348 --> 01:05:01,266
That's weird when it,
when there is water in between.

570
01:05:01,266 --> 01:05:04,227
And then it turns into nothing.

571
01:05:05,854 --> 01:05:07,063
That's a great picture.

572
01:05:08,273 --> 01:05:09,732
And this is my mom.

573
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:12,692
Your grandmother.

574
01:05:18,407 --> 01:05:19,450
I didn't know.

575
01:05:23,496 --> 01:05:24,663
It just seems that...

576
01:05:25,038 --> 01:05:28,041
Everything has changed between us so fast.

577
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:30,250
Ever since Travis came.

578
01:05:30,542 --> 01:05:31,752
What's changed?

579
01:05:33,921 --> 01:05:35,130
I'm just afraid.

580
01:05:36,924 --> 01:05:38,298
Afraid of Travis?

581
01:05:39,132 --> 01:05:40,092
No...

582
01:05:40,967 --> 01:05:42,469
Then what?

583
01:05:45,055 --> 01:05:47,765
Of what will happen to us if we loose Hunter.

584
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:53,020
We're not going to loose Hunter.

585
01:05:53,395 --> 01:05:56,065
Then why do you keep pushing them together?

586
01:05:56,774 --> 01:05:59,401
It's almost as if you wanted them to leave.

587
01:05:59,985 --> 01:06:02,363
- Who?
- Hunter.

588
01:06:03,613 --> 01:06:05,782
You know what I'm talking about.

589
01:06:06,157 --> 01:06:09,367
You keep promoting this
father son business between...

590
01:06:09,826 --> 01:06:11,327
It's not business.

591
01:06:12,245 --> 01:06:15,540
Travis is his father,
and Hunter is his son.

592
01:06:16,497 --> 01:06:17,748
That's a fact.

593
01:06:18,290 --> 01:06:19,834
You've known that all along.

594
01:06:21,502 --> 01:06:23,338
Travis happens to be my brother.

595
01:06:23,672 --> 01:06:24,756
I know he is.

596
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:27,174
Well, what's this promotion bull shit?

597
01:06:27,508 --> 01:06:29,008
You want us to go on pretending...

598
01:06:29,342 --> 01:06:31,803
That we are the parents
of my brother's son?

599
01:06:32,512 --> 01:06:34,264
Well, how long do you want Hunter
to buy that?

600
01:06:34,597 --> 01:06:36,850
I was never pretending.

601
01:06:37,142 --> 01:06:40,979
I love him, just like
he was my own flesh and blood.

602
01:06:42,563 --> 01:06:43,772
So do I.

603
01:06:54,530 --> 01:06:55,615
Hi Ann.

604
01:06:56,116 --> 01:06:57,200
Hi Travis.

605
01:06:57,909 --> 01:06:59,870
You don't sleep much, do you?

606
01:07:09,878 --> 01:07:11,171
Travis.

607
01:07:12,422 --> 01:07:14,466
There is something I have to tell you.

608
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:16,468
I was not going to,

609
01:07:16,801 --> 01:07:20,304
Because somehow it makes things easier
that nobody knows.

610
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:24,265
I never even told Walt, or Hunter.

611
01:07:26,017 --> 01:07:27,185
What is it?

612
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:32,773
After Hunter came to live with us,

613
01:07:33,523 --> 01:07:34,941
Jane used to call.

614
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:38,487
Asking about him.

615
01:07:38,987 --> 01:07:43,114
She made me promise not to tell anyone
that she was calling.

616
01:07:43,531 --> 01:07:45,074
Did she ask about me?

617
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:50,496
Yes. In the beginning.

618
01:07:54,708 --> 01:07:56,126
Where did she call from?

619
01:07:57,502 --> 01:07:59,170
Places in Texas.

620
01:07:59,504 --> 01:08:00,922
What places?

621
01:08:04,843 --> 01:08:06,345
Let me finish, Travis.

622
01:08:09,431 --> 01:08:12,474
After what happened
between you and Jane...

623
01:08:13,809 --> 01:08:16,603
She decided Hunter should be with us.

624
01:08:18,188 --> 01:08:20,981
She said she couldn't be a mother to him anymore.

625
01:08:29,155 --> 01:08:32,158
She stopped being a mother to him
a long time before that.

626
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:47,873
Travis. I don't want to feel I'm...

627
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,377
Hiding something from you anymore.

628
01:08:56,217 --> 01:08:57,468
She was young...

629
01:09:03,475 --> 01:09:04,685
She wanted something,

630
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:07,063
But I just couldn't figure out what it was.

631
01:09:14,113 --> 01:09:16,825
I just didn't realize how much rage I had.

632
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:28,504
A little more than a year ago
she stopped calling.

633
01:09:29,089 --> 01:09:31,175
I haven't heard from her since then.

634
01:09:32,843 --> 01:09:33,844
Nothing?

635
01:09:35,513 --> 01:09:36,514
Not a word.

636
01:09:37,974 --> 01:09:39,560
But on the last call,

637
01:09:41,145 --> 01:09:44,191
She asked for me
to open a bank account for Hunter.

638
01:09:45,984 --> 01:09:47,402
A bank account?

639
01:09:47,527 --> 01:09:50,073
All I know about Jane now is...

640
01:09:51,074 --> 01:09:52,784
She goes to this bank.

641
01:09:53,367 --> 01:09:55,620
On the 5th of each month...

642
01:09:56,288 --> 01:09:58,290
And wires money for Hunter.

643
01:10:03,004 --> 01:10:05,090
Jane, still sends him money.

644
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:10,971
Sometimes a hundred dollars,
sometimes 50, or 5...

645
01:10:11,973 --> 01:10:13,642
For Hunter's future.

646
01:10:14,559 --> 01:10:16,813
I had the bank trace the wire.

647
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:19,857
It comes from a bank in Huston.

648
01:10:20,483 --> 01:10:21,859
What bank?

649
01:10:23,278 --> 01:10:26,073
I wrote it down if you want it.

650
01:10:29,411 --> 01:10:30,745
What's the date today?

651
01:10:31,287 --> 01:10:32,914
The first of November.

652
01:10:38,671 --> 01:10:41,424
I don't think we should do that. You're right.

653
01:10:44,929 --> 01:10:46,556
I meant the other thing.

654
01:11:06,454 --> 01:11:10,667
You will all be caught
with your diapers down.

655
01:11:11,042 --> 01:11:12,669
That is a promise!

656
01:11:13,211 --> 01:11:17,176
I give you this promise on my mother's head!

657
01:11:17,718 --> 01:11:23,433
For right here today,
standing on the very head of my mother.

658
01:11:23,725 --> 01:11:26,394
Which is how a god treats her.

659
01:11:26,811 --> 01:11:30,442
Which everybody who wasn't bought
in a fucking store.

660
01:11:30,776 --> 01:11:35,197
Wanna know and understand
to the very letter what death holds.

661
01:11:37,033 --> 01:11:39,660
They will invade you in your beds,

662
01:11:40,536 --> 01:11:43,332
They will snap you from your hot tubs.

663
01:11:44,374 --> 01:11:48,420
They will pluck you right
out of your expensive sports cars.

664
01:11:49,213 --> 01:11:51,425
There is no where.

665
01:11:53,427 --> 01:11:55,096
Absolutely no where...

666
01:11:55,596 --> 01:11:58,141
In this God forsaken valley.

667
01:11:59,101 --> 01:12:03,731
I'm talking about from the rage
of my voice right here...

668
01:12:04,065 --> 01:12:07,235
Clear out to the goddamn
Mojave desert.

669
01:12:07,610 --> 01:12:11,490
And beyond that.
Clear up this mess though.

670
01:12:13,242 --> 01:12:16,453
For everywhere else in the valley
always had a sona.

671
01:12:17,664 --> 01:12:20,750
None of that area will be
called the safety zone.

672
01:12:21,418 --> 01:12:23,505
There will be no safety zone.

673
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:25,757
I can guarantee this safety zone...

674
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:27,592
Will be eliminated,

675
01:12:27,759 --> 01:12:29,302
Eradicated.

676
01:12:30,138 --> 01:12:34,725
You will all be exerdited
to the land of no return.

677
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:38,105
It's eradication to no where.

678
01:12:38,814 --> 01:12:41,358
And if you think that's going to be fun,

679
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:44,028
You've got another thing coming.

680
01:12:46,197 --> 01:12:48,366
They made me a slime bucket.

681
01:12:48,741 --> 01:12:52,913
But believe me,
I know what the hell I'm talking about.

682
01:12:53,581 --> 01:12:55,125
I'm not crazy.

683
01:12:55,876 --> 01:12:59,839
And don't say I didn't warn you.
I warned you.

684
01:13:00,256 --> 01:13:01,841
I warned all of you.

685
01:13:13,313 --> 01:13:15,064
Thought you were afraid of heights.

686
01:13:15,732 --> 01:13:18,360
No, I'm not afraid of heights,
I'm afraid of falling.

687
01:13:19,153 --> 01:13:20,905
Oh, yeah? Well then just don't look down.

688
01:13:24,618 --> 01:13:27,287
To bad the things don't look
the same on the ground.

689
01:13:28,164 --> 01:13:29,207
What do you mean?

690
01:13:31,502 --> 01:13:32,920
Things are clearer up here.

691
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:35,964
Might clear things up.

692
01:13:36,131 --> 01:13:38,635
Yeah, I had a talk with Ann last night.

693
01:13:39,427 --> 01:13:40,929
Yeah, she is pretty upset.

694
01:13:42,096 --> 01:13:43,306
Yeah, I know.

695
01:13:45,392 --> 01:13:46,352
I'm going to leave.

696
01:13:47,061 --> 01:13:49,063
- What?
- I'm leaving.

697
01:13:49,939 --> 01:13:53,401
I didn't tell you this in order to make you leave.
I'm not trying to get rid of you, Travis.

698
01:13:53,527 --> 01:13:55,821
- I know that.
- Well, what good is that going to do?

699
01:13:55,821 --> 01:13:57,573
- I wanna...
- That's not going to solve anything.

700
01:13:58,491 --> 01:14:00,409
I'm going to go find Jane.

701
01:14:01,954 --> 01:14:03,247
How you going to do that?

702
01:14:03,832 --> 01:14:06,000
It's been four years.
She's completely disappeared.

703
01:14:06,376 --> 01:14:08,253
I tried to find her, I tried everything,
I couldn't find her.

704
01:14:08,586 --> 01:14:11,132
Now, I haven't tried yet.
I can find her.

705
01:14:11,298 --> 01:14:12,258
What make's you so sure?

706
01:14:12,591 --> 01:14:14,009
Oh, I just know.

707
01:14:14,677 --> 01:14:15,886
Can we go down now?

708
01:14:16,011 --> 01:14:19,516
No! God damn it!

709
01:14:19,850 --> 01:14:22,185
You tell me what happened Travis!

710
01:14:22,602 --> 01:14:24,063
I'm sick of this fucking mystery!

711
01:14:24,439 --> 01:14:26,065
I've been treating you
like a spoiled kid...

712
01:14:26,149 --> 01:14:27,733
Ever since I picked you up in the desert.

713
01:14:28,067 --> 01:14:30,904
Now you tell me what happened,
with you and Jane!

714
01:14:31,947 --> 01:14:32,781
Shit!

715
01:14:34,409 --> 01:14:36,494
I know it's none of my business.

716
01:14:37,955 --> 01:14:40,791
Uh, well, I need to take...

717
01:14:42,001 --> 01:14:44,129
Money, credit cards.

718
01:14:44,629 --> 01:14:46,214
Alright, sure, you can have them.

719
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:47,507
You know you'll get it back.

720
01:14:47,799 --> 01:14:49,342
Oh, forget that. You can have them.

721
01:14:49,885 --> 01:14:51,179
I want to find her, Walt.

722
01:15:17,376 --> 01:15:18,545
Hunter!

723
01:15:28,556 --> 01:15:29,849
That your car?

724
01:15:33,813 --> 01:15:36,315
Yup! Come on!

725
01:15:38,068 --> 01:15:39,278
Radical.

726
01:15:53,128 --> 01:15:54,879
This is not bad stuff.

727
01:15:56,881 --> 01:15:58,884
Ann puts it in lunch everyday.

728
01:15:59,218 --> 01:16:02,179
Lavash, Ki, Ri. Sticky.

729
01:16:02,471 --> 01:16:03,848
Lavash, what?

730
01:16:06,017 --> 01:16:07,602
Ri, Rrrr, Ri.

731
01:16:08,186 --> 01:16:09,604
Ri, Rrrr, Ri.

732
01:16:11,064 --> 01:16:12,442
I like it.

733
01:16:14,653 --> 01:16:16,321
- Dad.
- Yap?

734
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,575
Where did you go all that time?

735
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:23,288
Mexico.

736
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:25,332
How come?

737
01:16:27,168 --> 01:16:28,878
I didn't know where else to go.

738
01:16:31,213 --> 01:16:32,507
Where did mom go?

739
01:16:34,426 --> 01:16:35,469
I don't know.

740
01:16:36,428 --> 01:16:38,054
But right now, she is somewhere in Huston.

741
01:16:38,681 --> 01:16:40,433
That's where the space center is.

742
01:16:44,396 --> 01:16:46,483
And that's what I wanted to talk to you about.

743
01:16:47,484 --> 01:16:48,776
I have to go away now.

744
01:16:49,486 --> 01:16:50,445
Why?

745
01:16:51,572 --> 01:16:52,823
Because I'm going to find her.

746
01:16:53,073 --> 01:16:56,202
What about me, you just found me.
Can I come with?

747
01:17:01,374 --> 01:17:02,417
What about Walt and Ann?

748
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:05,338
We would never come back here?

749
01:17:05,713 --> 01:17:06,964
Sure, but...

750
01:17:08,132 --> 01:17:09,133
I don't know when.

751
01:17:19,271 --> 01:17:20,523
I want to come with.

752
01:17:23,609 --> 01:17:25,487
I want to find her too.

753
01:17:26,112 --> 01:17:27,364
When do we go?

754
01:17:32,787 --> 01:17:33,788
Right now.

755
01:17:34,205 --> 01:17:35,748
Then, come on, lets go.

756
01:17:36,415 --> 01:17:39,002
First we have to stop
to get supplies for the trip.

757
01:17:39,086 --> 01:17:39,920
OK.

758
01:17:55,564 --> 01:17:57,315
We got to buy jackets, tee shirts,

759
01:17:57,315 --> 01:17:59,360
Tooth brushes, stuff like that.

760
01:17:59,485 --> 01:18:01,362
Maybe even walky talkies.

761
01:18:01,863 --> 01:18:03,322
Talkies of course.

762
01:18:03,948 --> 01:18:05,032
Just in case.

763
01:18:14,836 --> 01:18:16,171
Do you know what?

764
01:18:16,629 --> 01:18:17,672
What?

765
01:18:19,259 --> 01:18:22,722
This whole galaxy, the whole universe...

766
01:18:23,055 --> 01:18:26,852
Used to be compressed
into a tiny spot this big.

767
01:18:27,769 --> 01:18:30,272
- And you know what happened?
- What?

768
01:18:31,106 --> 01:18:33,651
It went "Phchue..."
and blew up.

769
01:18:34,027 --> 01:18:37,322
All the spark, flying every place,

770
01:18:37,614 --> 01:18:39,450
In space...

771
01:18:40,326 --> 01:18:42,244
It was just gas. It was flowing around.

772
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:43,621
The earth was?

773
01:18:43,954 --> 01:18:45,957
Yeah, the earth was really gas.

774
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:49,711
And the sun formed, and it was so hot...

775
01:18:50,003 --> 01:18:54,509
That the earth just formed
into one hard ball.

776
01:18:54,967 --> 01:18:57,638
Of ocean. Nothing but ocean.

777
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:00,391
So there was sea animals and...

778
01:19:00,433 --> 01:19:04,145
Under the water,
a volcano went... "Pachooo".

779
01:19:04,979 --> 01:19:07,316
And... The hot lava hit the water...

780
01:19:07,399 --> 01:19:10,402
And formed rock to make land.

781
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:24,710
If you want to make a collect call,

782
01:19:25,002 --> 01:19:26,839
You dial the operator and tell her that...

783
01:19:26,964 --> 01:19:28,049
I know.

784
01:19:28,424 --> 01:19:30,802
Good, then call Walt and Ann.

785
01:19:31,177 --> 01:19:32,136
Why?

786
01:19:32,721 --> 01:19:34,557
Because, so they don't worry about you,

787
01:19:34,598 --> 01:19:35,683
So they know where you are.

788
01:19:36,058 --> 01:19:37,643
But what am I going to say?

789
01:19:37,935 --> 01:19:39,019
Just tell them the truth.

790
01:19:39,396 --> 01:19:42,774
Tell them that you are with me,
and on to Texas.

791
01:19:43,567 --> 01:19:45,110
They are going to flip out.

792
01:19:45,443 --> 01:19:48,114
No... but you can handle it.

793
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:49,323
OK?

794
01:19:49,574 --> 01:19:51,033
Why can't you do it?

795
01:19:51,409 --> 01:19:52,953
I can't do it.

796
01:19:54,371 --> 01:19:55,455
Why?

797
01:19:55,581 --> 01:19:57,833
Because it has to be you.

798
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:03,299
Oh, jeez...

799
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:05,676
Why can't he do anything?

800
01:20:11,892 --> 01:20:13,477
- Hello.
- Hi dad.

801
01:20:13,686 --> 01:20:15,229
Hunter. Where are you?

802
01:20:15,563 --> 01:20:18,065
You know what time it is?
I've been calling everywhere looking for you.

803
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:24,281
Yeah, yeah. Hunter, just listen to me now.

804
01:20:24,615 --> 01:20:26,784
Where are you, exactly?

805
01:20:29,412 --> 01:20:30,997
St. Vernidino?

806
01:20:31,456 --> 01:20:34,419
Hunter, what do you mean
you are in St. Vernidino?

807
01:20:34,961 --> 01:20:35,837
Wait a minute honey.

808
01:20:36,004 --> 01:20:37,672
- How did...
- Let me talk to him.

809
01:20:38,882 --> 01:20:40,009
Hunter.

810
01:20:40,801 --> 01:20:42,220
Are you alright?

811
01:20:42,428 --> 01:20:43,513
Yeah.

812
01:20:44,055 --> 01:20:45,556
What are you doing?

813
01:20:47,976 --> 01:20:49,728
With Travis?

814
01:20:52,356 --> 01:20:53,942
Why are you going?

815
01:20:56,694 --> 01:21:00,491
Tell me where you are Hunter.
Just tell me where you are.

816
01:21:02,493 --> 01:21:04,203
What's the name of it?

817
01:21:05,663 --> 01:21:06,749
Oh, my god.

818
01:21:08,125 --> 01:21:09,043
Hunter.

819
01:21:09,919 --> 01:21:12,505
You tell Travis, to turn around...

820
01:21:12,838 --> 01:21:15,425
And come back right now.

821
01:21:15,842 --> 01:21:17,302
Do you understand me?

822
01:21:18,262 --> 01:21:19,429
Let me talk to him.

823
01:21:20,807 --> 01:21:22,267
What should I do?

824
01:21:23,226 --> 01:21:25,019
Just hang up.

825
01:21:27,773 --> 01:21:29,692
Bye mom. Got to go now.

826
01:21:32,111 --> 01:21:33,112
Hunter...?

827
01:21:34,781 --> 01:21:36,032
Hunter!

828
01:21:53,471 --> 01:21:54,472
Did they flip out?

829
01:21:54,848 --> 01:21:56,099
Yeah, she did.

830
01:21:56,725 --> 01:21:58,560
You're not sorry you came, are you?

831
01:21:58,643 --> 01:21:59,519
No.

832
01:21:59,895 --> 01:22:02,648
Well, you can go back to them
any time you want.

833
01:22:03,024 --> 01:22:04,066
You just tell me, OK?

834
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:05,902
I don't want to go back.

835
01:22:07,029 --> 01:22:09,615
Well, I know, but just in case
you change your mind.

836
01:22:56,003 --> 01:22:58,464
I'm so used to calling her mom.

837
01:23:00,759 --> 01:23:02,052
Ann?

838
01:23:02,803 --> 01:23:03,679
Yeah.

839
01:23:08,893 --> 01:23:11,187
She sounded so sad.

840
01:23:14,316 --> 01:23:15,442
I know.

841
01:23:19,573 --> 01:23:22,034
What do you think mom will look like now?

842
01:23:26,873 --> 01:23:28,125
I don't know.

843
01:23:31,461 --> 01:23:32,921
Do you remember her?

844
01:23:34,007 --> 01:23:37,760
Not really.
Only from that little movie we saw.

845
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:48,773
You look happy then.

846
01:23:50,276 --> 01:23:51,235
Yeah.

847
01:23:58,076 --> 01:23:59,536
You can keep that.

848
01:24:17,724 --> 01:24:18,683
Night.

849
01:25:00,567 --> 01:25:05,489
Dad, if a guy put a baby down,

850
01:25:05,489 --> 01:25:08,703
Traveled at the speed of light
for an hour,

851
01:25:09,287 --> 01:25:11,455
If he traveled at the speed of light,

852
01:25:11,789 --> 01:25:14,585
He would come back in an hour,

853
01:25:14,876 --> 01:25:16,211
He would be an hour older,

854
01:25:16,295 --> 01:25:19,464
But the little baby would be a very old man.

855
01:25:21,216 --> 01:25:22,510
Oh, yeah?

856
01:25:22,635 --> 01:25:25,054
So, how long would it take him
to get to Huston?

857
01:25:28,225 --> 01:25:30,770
Ah, if they were to travel...

858
01:25:31,479 --> 01:25:33,440
I would say about 3 seconds.

859
01:25:35,359 --> 01:25:37,987
Ah, over, I didn't get that last part.

860
01:25:39,739 --> 01:25:41,491
It would take them 3 seconds...

861
01:25:41,825 --> 01:25:43,702
To get from California to Huston.

862
01:25:44,786 --> 01:25:46,496
At light speed.

863
01:25:55,132 --> 01:25:57,426
- This is Huston?
- Yup.

864
01:25:57,968 --> 01:26:00,930
How are we going to find her
in a big city like this?

865
01:26:01,306 --> 01:26:03,601
- I know where she'll be.
- Where?

866
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:07,605
A bank. She's going to deposit
some money at a certain bank today.

867
01:26:11,151 --> 01:26:12,653
This is a bank?

868
01:26:13,403 --> 01:26:15,323
What kind of a bank is this?

869
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:17,450
Looks like a drive in.

870
01:26:17,784 --> 01:26:20,036
I've never seen a bank like that.

871
01:26:21,037 --> 01:26:22,373
Me neither.

872
01:26:23,290 --> 01:26:26,377
There are so many cars...
We'll never find her.

873
01:26:26,710 --> 01:26:28,797
Oh, yeah, we will. Come on.

874
01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:32,008
We will split up and then
we will cover more ground. OK?

875
01:26:32,884 --> 01:26:35,055
Yeah, we could use the walky talkies.

876
01:26:35,389 --> 01:26:37,266
Hey, now you're going.

877
01:26:37,599 --> 01:26:39,810
- I'll let you out here.
- OK.

878
01:26:46,985 --> 01:26:48,821
Can you hear me dad? Over.

879
01:26:49,530 --> 01:26:51,031
Loud and clear.

880
01:26:52,825 --> 01:26:53,659
Good.

881
01:27:19,189 --> 01:27:20,733
Hunter in position one. Over.

882
01:27:21,817 --> 01:27:24,571
Travis in position two.
We got it covered.

883
01:27:25,530 --> 01:27:27,866
I told you it would be
more than a toy. Over.

884
01:27:28,199 --> 01:27:30,077
Ten four. Over and out.

885
01:29:10,447 --> 01:29:12,866
Dad, she is just leaving the building.

886
01:29:13,241 --> 01:29:14,409
Get over here.

887
01:29:14,743 --> 01:29:17,581
Dad, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

888
01:29:22,377 --> 01:29:25,923
She's leaving the building.
Get over here!

889
01:29:26,841 --> 01:29:28,301
Dad!

890
01:29:28,718 --> 01:29:30,095
Come on!

891
01:29:30,596 --> 01:29:33,098
Dad! Wake up!

892
01:29:33,724 --> 01:29:36,645
Wake up! She is leaving the bank.

893
01:29:37,604 --> 01:29:39,189
Dad! Wake up!

894
01:29:40,690 --> 01:29:43,319
Wh... Where is... duh...

895
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:45,696
I'm on my way.

896
01:29:46,530 --> 01:29:47,740
Oh, no.

897
01:30:07,555 --> 01:30:09,182
She went that way!

898
01:30:09,976 --> 01:30:11,477
Which way did she go?

899
01:30:11,852 --> 01:30:13,437
Hunter! Come on!

900
01:30:32,377 --> 01:30:35,547
Hunter, did you really
get a good look at her, or what?

901
01:30:35,922 --> 01:30:38,426
It was the right one,
I know it was her.

902
01:30:38,551 --> 01:30:40,594
Oh, god. We have lost her.

903
01:30:41,053 --> 01:30:43,432
Can this piece of junk go faster?

904
01:30:45,225 --> 01:30:47,602
There are 10 thousand cars here,
how are we going to find it?

905
01:30:47,728 --> 01:30:48,687
I don't know which one is it.

906
01:30:49,062 --> 01:30:50,606
Go faster dad, go faster.

907
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:53,318
Hunter, what color...
the car was red, right?

908
01:30:53,651 --> 01:30:56,238
Yeah, a little red Chevy.

909
01:31:01,119 --> 01:31:03,497
Do you see anything?
I don't know what it looks like.

910
01:31:03,789 --> 01:31:05,916
You'll have to help me look,
can you see it?

911
01:31:06,167 --> 01:31:07,793
No, not yet.

912
01:31:10,213 --> 01:31:12,799
- I see it! I see it!
- Where, where?

913
01:31:13,675 --> 01:31:15,844
Over in that lane, in that lane!

914
01:31:15,969 --> 01:31:17,096
Which, which lane?

915
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:20,558
- The right one!
- Alright, settle down, I see it.

916
01:31:24,855 --> 01:31:27,816
See if it's her. Can you tell?

917
01:31:29,569 --> 01:31:31,405
I can't tell.

918
01:31:31,697 --> 01:31:33,783
Wait a minute, there's two red cars now.

919
01:31:34,575 --> 01:31:35,868
Which one is it?

920
01:31:37,329 --> 01:31:38,830
Ah, the right!
The left one!

921
01:31:39,289 --> 01:31:41,458
- You sure?
- Yeah, the left one.

922
01:31:48,132 --> 01:31:50,469
- You sure this is the one though.
- Yeah.

923
01:31:55,641 --> 01:32:00,648
I hope you are right Hunter,
if we are following the wrong car,
we are going to wait a whole another month.

924
01:32:01,107 --> 01:32:02,067
I'll be eight then.

925
01:32:02,484 --> 01:32:03,402
You'll be what?

926
01:32:03,736 --> 01:32:05,405
I'll be eight then.

927
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:13,288
Lets get closer, we can wave.

928
01:32:13,455 --> 01:32:17,502
No, no... we don't want to get too close.
We might scare her,

929
01:32:17,502 --> 01:32:19,045
She'll have a wreck or something.

930
01:32:21,006 --> 01:32:23,717
- OK?
- OK. I guess so.

931
01:32:34,188 --> 01:32:37,693
Well, I wonder where she is going.

932
01:32:38,152 --> 01:32:40,404
Maybe to work.
What do you think?

933
01:32:41,405 --> 01:32:42,906
Yeah, could be.

934
01:33:54,866 --> 01:33:56,618
Looks like a girls car to me.

935
01:33:57,285 --> 01:33:58,830
Could it be hers?

936
01:34:01,124 --> 01:34:03,710
Could be... get in the truck
and I'll tell you my plan.

937
01:34:03,793 --> 01:34:04,586
OK.

938
01:34:13,431 --> 01:34:16,600
Roll the windows up, lock the doors,
and if anybody talks to you,

939
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:20,439
Tell them your daddy's inside
and he'll be right back. OK?

940
01:34:20,439 --> 01:34:21,231
OK.

941
01:34:21,815 --> 01:34:23,275
- You OK?
- Yap.

942
01:34:52,018 --> 01:34:56,564
Sergeant Jojo, call for you, booth 22.
Sergeant Jojo, booth 22.

943
01:34:57,065 --> 01:34:59,610
Come in, no bets,
you guys are going to love this.

944
01:34:59,777 --> 01:35:02,071
The girls here spend so much time
with a guy that...

945
01:35:02,321 --> 01:35:03,655
Most of them live alone.

946
01:35:03,822 --> 01:35:05,825
But it's tough to live alone in a city like this.

947
01:35:05,909 --> 01:35:07,452
A lot of violent things happen here.

948
01:35:08,078 --> 01:35:10,246
Stuff like rape, like murder,

949
01:35:10,497 --> 01:35:12,416
That's why we have a police force.

950
01:36:12,447 --> 01:36:13,531
Sir?

951
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:17,285
Sir, you are in the wrong place.

952
01:36:19,496 --> 01:36:21,582
It's too early, all the girls are downstairs.

953
01:36:26,005 --> 01:36:28,549
Please get a ride, cus I'm getting crazy.

954
01:38:25,811 --> 01:38:27,064
Yeah, who do you want?

955
01:38:27,397 --> 01:38:31,902
Yeah, I want to see a blond girl
with kinda short straight hair, about 25 years old.

956
01:38:32,862 --> 01:38:33,821
OK.

957
01:38:34,323 --> 01:38:36,533
She's coming down,
stay on the line.

958
01:38:55,556 --> 01:38:56,557
Hello honey.

959
01:38:58,976 --> 01:39:00,396
Oh, mercy.

960
01:39:00,813 --> 01:39:04,817
You know, 23, I work 23
of the 24 bids in this place,

961
01:39:07,655 --> 01:39:09,198
unless I make 24.

962
01:39:10,825 --> 01:39:12,827
What can I do for you today?

963
01:39:14,913 --> 01:39:16,206
I have an idea.

964
01:39:16,957 --> 01:39:18,500
How about water polo?

965
01:39:20,586 --> 01:39:21,796
Fun.

966
01:39:24,340 --> 01:39:25,800
Oh, well...

967
01:39:26,510 --> 01:39:27,636
Tell you what.

968
01:39:28,011 --> 01:39:30,681
Why don't you just tell nurse Piffs
what your pain is.

969
01:39:30,806 --> 01:39:32,182
Maybe I can find a cure... hmm?

970
01:39:32,474 --> 01:39:34,144
Well, why don't you look at me?

971
01:39:34,477 --> 01:39:36,020
I am looking at you.

972
01:39:36,312 --> 01:39:39,149
Yeah, but I'm over here,
can't you see me?

973
01:39:39,441 --> 01:39:42,696
Listen sweet heart, if I can see you,
I wouldn't be working here.

974
01:39:43,613 --> 01:39:45,699
Well, what do you see?

975
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:50,121
See what you see.
Nurse Bibbs.

976
01:39:50,913 --> 01:39:52,957
Nurse Bibbs and a rubber horse.

977
01:39:53,876 --> 01:39:56,712
Oh, oh, I see.

978
01:39:58,297 --> 01:40:00,383
Thank you Nurse Bibbs.

979
01:40:00,717 --> 01:40:02,010
Thank you.

980
01:41:12,259 --> 01:41:13,468
Hi.

981
01:41:18,016 --> 01:41:19,435
Are you out there?

982
01:41:21,730 --> 01:41:25,608
Well, I see your light's still on,
so you must be out there.

983
01:41:31,699 --> 01:41:33,409
It's OK if you don't want to talk,

984
01:41:33,492 --> 01:41:35,996
I don't want to talk either sometimes.

985
01:41:37,873 --> 01:41:39,833
I'd just like to stay silent.

986
01:41:46,674 --> 01:41:48,093
Do you mind if I sit down?

987
01:41:58,105 --> 01:42:00,734
Do you mind if I sit down?

988
01:42:02,903 --> 01:42:03,945
No.

989
01:42:07,115 --> 01:42:08,076
Thanks.

990
01:42:09,035 --> 01:42:12,331
Legs get a little tired from standing all the time.

991
01:42:16,461 --> 01:42:18,296
Is this your first visit here?

992
01:42:19,589 --> 01:42:20,507
Yes.

993
01:42:24,179 --> 01:42:27,307
Well, this whole thing must seem
kinda strange to you, huh?

994
01:42:28,059 --> 01:42:31,145
You realize that I can't see you even
though you can see me.

995
01:42:32,021 --> 01:42:34,107
Well, that takes a little getting used to.

996
01:42:39,363 --> 01:42:41,366
Am I looking at your face now?

997
01:42:51,419 --> 01:42:53,087
It don't matter.

998
01:43:07,981 --> 01:43:10,400
If there is anything you want to talk about.

999
01:43:10,525 --> 01:43:12,777
I'll just listen. Alright?

1000
01:43:14,655 --> 01:43:17,324
I'm a real good listener.

1001
01:43:29,465 --> 01:43:31,300
Is there something...

1002
01:43:32,593 --> 01:43:34,846
Is there something I can do for you?

1003
01:43:44,607 --> 01:43:46,859
Do you mind if I take off my sweater?

1004
01:43:49,696 --> 01:43:51,490
I'll just take off my sweater.

1005
01:43:51,740 --> 01:43:53,450
No, no. Don't.

1006
01:43:54,493 --> 01:43:56,662
Please, please leave it on.

1007
01:44:05,131 --> 01:44:06,216
I'm sorry.

1008
01:44:10,513 --> 01:44:13,516
I just don't know exactly
what it is you want.

1009
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:17,395
I don't want anything.

1010
01:44:19,773 --> 01:44:21,818
So why did you come here then?

1011
01:44:31,829 --> 01:44:33,664
I want to talk to you.

1012
01:44:54,939 --> 01:44:56,984
Is there something you want to tell me?

1013
01:45:00,904 --> 01:45:01,906
No...

1014
01:45:07,288 --> 01:45:10,125
You can tell me, I can keep a secret.

1015
01:45:21,345 --> 01:45:24,808
Is it all you do, just talk?

1016
01:45:28,772 --> 01:45:30,523
Well, yeah.

1017
01:45:32,817 --> 01:45:34,277
Yeah, mostly.

1018
01:45:34,944 --> 01:45:36,406
And listen.

1019
01:45:41,037 --> 01:45:42,581
What else do you do?

1020
01:45:53,802 --> 01:45:55,303
Why are you laughing?

1021
01:45:55,679 --> 01:45:56,889
I'm sorry.

1022
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:02,604
I'm sorry.

1023
01:46:04,272 --> 01:46:06,441
So, what else do you do?

1024
01:46:08,819 --> 01:46:10,613
Nothing, really.

1025
01:46:13,492 --> 01:46:16,412
Oh, well, we are not allowed
to see the customers out of here.

1026
01:46:18,748 --> 01:46:22,878
What if you see them,
do you go home with them?

1027
01:46:24,547 --> 01:46:26,215
No sir, we don't.

1028
01:46:29,094 --> 01:46:32,472
We're not allowed to have any outside
relationships with the customers.

1029
01:46:32,764 --> 01:46:35,475
Yeah, but you can really see them
if you want too, can't you.

1030
01:46:35,475 --> 01:46:38,354
I mean you can go home with them,
if you want to, all these places say that.

1031
01:46:38,521 --> 01:46:42,358
I mean, how much extra money do you make?
How much money do you make on the side?

1032
01:46:55,207 --> 01:46:56,251
I'm sorry,

1033
01:46:56,334 --> 01:46:59,171
Sir, I think you maybe want to talk
to one of the other girls.

1034
01:46:59,296 --> 01:47:01,631
I'll see if I can find one for you.

1035
01:47:01,631 --> 01:47:03,634
No, no, no. No!

1036
01:47:04,302 --> 01:47:05,845
Please.

1037
01:47:08,097 --> 01:47:09,641
Please don't go.

1038
01:47:14,688 --> 01:47:17,650
I just don't think
I'm the one you want to talk to.

1039
01:47:20,029 --> 01:47:21,405
Please.

1040
01:47:22,824 --> 01:47:24,659
Please don't go, I'm sorry.

1041
01:47:34,378 --> 01:47:35,421
Alright.

1042
01:47:42,721 --> 01:47:43,765
I'm sorry.

1043
01:47:51,566 --> 01:47:52,651
That's OK.

1044
01:48:04,832 --> 01:48:08,126
I know how hard it is
to talk to strangers sometimes.

1045
01:48:13,675 --> 01:48:15,218
Just relax.

1046
01:48:17,138 --> 01:48:19,265
Relax and tell me
what's on your mind.

1047
01:48:21,851 --> 01:48:23,228
I'll listen.

1048
01:48:25,773 --> 01:48:26,732
To you...

1049
01:48:32,406 --> 01:48:34,449
I don't mind listening.

1050
01:48:42,876 --> 01:48:45,087
I do it all the time.

1051
01:49:06,780 --> 01:49:08,282
She was there, wasn't she?

1052
01:49:47,328 --> 01:49:48,704
What's that?

1053
01:49:54,962 --> 01:49:56,129
A vacant lot.

1054
01:49:57,006 --> 01:49:58,716
I bought that land
when we were all together,

1055
01:49:59,342 --> 01:50:00,593
With your mom.

1056
01:50:04,307 --> 01:50:07,185
Thought we might live there someday.

1057
01:50:09,521 --> 01:50:10,606
Where?

1058
01:50:11,524 --> 01:50:12,733
Paris.

1059
01:50:13,818 --> 01:50:14,819
Texas.

1060
01:50:15,152 --> 01:50:16,237
Where's that?

1061
01:50:17,906 --> 01:50:19,783
Across the red river.

1062
01:50:24,956 --> 01:50:26,249
Do you like it?

1063
01:50:28,168 --> 01:50:29,711
Mean we live on dirt?

1064
01:50:45,272 --> 01:50:48,192
Why do you drink that stuff?
It stinks.

1065
01:50:50,194 --> 01:50:51,654
Wait a minute, where are you going?

1066
01:50:52,071 --> 01:50:53,448
To the truck.

1067
01:51:13,764 --> 01:51:15,098
Have another one?

1068
01:52:24,973 --> 01:52:28,019
This is not a place to bring a fancy woman.

1069
01:52:30,730 --> 01:52:35,194
Would you say, if you had a fancy woman,
would you bring her in a place like this?

1070
01:52:35,819 --> 01:52:37,696
What's a fancy woman?

1071
01:52:58,055 --> 01:52:59,014
My mother.

1072
01:53:01,808 --> 01:53:03,393
Not your mother.

1073
01:53:04,686 --> 01:53:05,980
But my mother.

1074
01:53:06,648 --> 01:53:08,942
Was not a fancy woman.

1075
01:53:09,192 --> 01:53:10,735
She was...

1076
01:53:17,034 --> 01:53:21,290
She never wanted to be a fancy woman.
She never even pretended to be a fancy woman.

1077
01:53:22,291 --> 01:53:23,751
Then what was she?

1078
01:53:24,669 --> 01:53:26,713
She was just plain.

1079
01:53:29,174 --> 01:53:31,009
Just plain, good.

1080
01:53:32,262 --> 01:53:34,138
She was very good.

1081
01:53:34,764 --> 01:53:35,974
But my daddy...

1082
01:53:38,978 --> 01:53:40,980
See, my daddy had...

1083
01:53:41,939 --> 01:53:43,649
He had this idea...

1084
01:53:43,983 --> 01:53:47,863
He had this idea that was kind of...

1085
01:53:48,989 --> 01:53:50,699
Kind of a sickness...

1086
01:53:52,286 --> 01:53:53,245
What idea?

1087
01:53:54,079 --> 01:53:56,164
He had this idea about her.

1088
01:54:00,044 --> 01:54:01,588
He looked at her...

1089
01:54:03,089 --> 01:54:04,883
But he didn't see her.

1090
01:54:08,220 --> 01:54:09,138
He...

1091
01:54:09,763 --> 01:54:11,599
He saw this idea.

1092
01:54:15,228 --> 01:54:19,609
And he told people
that she was from Paris.

1093
01:54:21,652 --> 01:54:23,279
A big joke.

1094
01:54:23,613 --> 01:54:25,408
He started telling everybody all the time,

1095
01:54:25,783 --> 01:54:27,869
Finally it wasn't a joke anymore.

1096
01:54:31,122 --> 01:54:32,750
He started believing it.

1097
01:54:34,793 --> 01:54:35,920
And...

1098
01:54:36,462 --> 01:54:38,130
He actually believed...

1099
01:54:41,051 --> 01:54:42,260
She...

1100
01:54:43,178 --> 01:54:44,471
Oh, God.

1101
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:47,767
She would get so embarrassed.

1102
01:54:50,269 --> 01:54:51,312
She'd...

1103
01:54:52,481 --> 01:54:53,941
She was so...

1104
01:54:56,778 --> 01:54:58,738
She was so shy...

1105
01:55:47,796 --> 01:55:49,381
Lominos, cha, cha.

1106
01:56:18,541 --> 01:56:19,752
Left, dad.

1107
01:56:35,646 --> 01:56:37,522
Hunter, it's me.

1108
01:56:40,652 --> 01:56:43,863
I was afraid I'd never be able to say
the right words to you,

1109
01:56:44,239 --> 01:56:45,782
In person.

1110
01:56:46,617 --> 01:56:50,371
So, I'm trying to do it like this.

1111
01:56:53,625 --> 01:56:56,544
When I first saw you, this time

1112
01:56:57,712 --> 01:56:59,005
at Walts...

1113
01:57:01,050 --> 01:57:03,886
I was hoping for all kinds of things.

1114
01:57:06,390 --> 01:57:09,602
I was hoping to show you
that I was your father.

1115
01:57:12,230 --> 01:57:14,108
You showed me I was.

1116
01:57:17,861 --> 01:57:20,115
But the biggest thing I hoped for...

1117
01:57:23,034 --> 01:57:24,661
Can't come true.

1118
01:57:27,331 --> 01:57:28,916
I know that now.

1119
01:57:31,794 --> 01:57:33,630
You belong together with your mother.

1120
01:57:36,258 --> 01:57:38,552
You belong together with your mother.

1121
01:57:40,764 --> 01:57:43,142
It was me that tore you apart.

1122
01:57:43,809 --> 01:57:46,938
And I owe it to you
to bring you back together.

1123
01:57:49,107 --> 01:57:50,984
But I can't stay with you.

1124
01:57:51,443 --> 01:57:53,613
I could never heal up what happened.

1125
01:57:54,822 --> 01:57:57,241
It's just the way it is.

1126
01:57:58,826 --> 01:58:01,622
I can't even hardly remember what happened...

1127
01:58:02,331 --> 01:58:03,749
It's like a gap.

1128
01:58:04,666 --> 01:58:07,337
It left me alone in a way that...

1129
01:58:07,712 --> 01:58:09,339
I haven't gotten over.

1130
01:58:10,173 --> 01:58:11,633
And right now...

1131
01:58:12,091 --> 01:58:13,176
I'm afraid.

1132
01:58:15,305 --> 01:58:18,099
I'm afraid of walking away again.

1133
01:58:18,391 --> 01:58:20,770
I'm afraid of what I might find.

1134
01:58:22,563 --> 01:58:24,607
But I'm even more afraid of...

1135
01:58:25,399 --> 01:58:27,527
Not facing this fear.

1136
01:58:28,570 --> 01:58:30,280
I love you Hunter.

1137
01:58:32,282 --> 01:58:34,619
I love you more than my life.

1138
01:58:46,091 --> 01:58:48,678
- Hey.
- Hey.

1139
01:58:54,601 --> 01:58:56,228
Can I tell you something?

1140
01:58:58,981 --> 01:59:01,359
Sure... Anything you like.

1141
01:59:03,152 --> 01:59:04,529
It's kind of long.

1142
01:59:06,281 --> 01:59:07,908
I have plenty of time.

1143
01:59:31,854 --> 01:59:33,480
I knew these people...

1144
01:59:34,274 --> 01:59:35,358
What people?

1145
01:59:37,402 --> 01:59:38,862
These two people...

1146
01:59:44,660 --> 01:59:46,370
They were in love with each other...

1147
01:59:49,708 --> 01:59:51,126
The girl was...

1148
01:59:51,711 --> 01:59:56,050
Very young, about 17, or 18...
I guess.

1149
01:59:57,468 --> 01:59:58,969
And the guy was...

1150
01:59:59,553 --> 02:00:00,931
Quite a bit older.

1151
02:00:02,557 --> 02:00:05,352
And he was kind of raggedy and wild.

1152
02:00:06,895 --> 02:00:08,773
And she was very beautiful, you know?

1153
02:00:11,567 --> 02:00:12,401
Yeah.

1154
02:00:13,194 --> 02:00:17,157
And together they turned everything
into a kind of an adventure.

1155
02:00:18,617 --> 02:00:20,077
And she liked that.

1156
02:00:21,621 --> 02:00:24,959
Just an ordinary trip
down to the grocery store was...

1157
02:00:25,542 --> 02:00:27,127
Full of adventure.

1158
02:00:29,130 --> 02:00:32,008
And they were always laughing
at stupid things...

1159
02:00:32,384 --> 02:00:34,220
He liked to make her laugh.

1160
02:00:35,805 --> 02:00:36,847
And...

1161
02:00:39,058 --> 02:00:41,436
They didn't much care for anything else.

1162
02:00:42,229 --> 02:00:45,649
Cus all they wanted to do
was be with each other.

1163
02:00:47,568 --> 02:00:49,404
They were always together.

1164
02:00:50,196 --> 02:00:52,407
Sounds like they were very happy.

1165
02:00:54,410 --> 02:00:57,289
Yes. They were, they were real happy.

1166
02:00:58,873 --> 02:00:59,916
And he...

1167
02:01:00,458 --> 02:01:02,169
Hey loved her more than...

1168
02:01:04,588 --> 02:01:06,465
He ever felt possible.

1169
02:01:09,803 --> 02:01:12,180
He couldn't stand being away from her,

1170
02:01:12,264 --> 02:01:14,517
During the day
when he went to work.

1171
02:01:19,731 --> 02:01:21,233
So he quit.

1172
02:01:22,901 --> 02:01:24,653
Just to be home with her.

1173
02:01:25,529 --> 02:01:28,074
And then he'd get another job
when the money ran out...

1174
02:01:29,827 --> 02:01:31,662
And then he'd quit again.

1175
02:01:32,330 --> 02:01:35,292
But pretty soon, she started to worry.

1176
02:01:39,713 --> 02:01:41,799
- Bout what?
- Money I guess.

1177
02:01:42,550 --> 02:01:43,926
Not having enough.

1178
02:01:44,260 --> 02:01:46,554
Not knowing when the next check
was coming in.

1179
02:01:49,016 --> 02:01:51,310
Yeap, I know that feeling.

1180
02:01:51,935 --> 02:01:54,438
So, he started to get kinda...

1181
02:01:54,814 --> 02:01:56,274
Torn inside.

1182
02:02:00,278 --> 02:02:01,489
How do you mean?

1183
02:02:02,950 --> 02:02:05,118
Well, he knew he had to work
to support her...

1184
02:02:06,119 --> 02:02:08,539
But he couldn't stand
being away from her either.

1185
02:02:10,875 --> 02:02:12,168
I see.

1186
02:02:12,710 --> 02:02:15,839
And the more he was away from her,
the crazier he got.

1187
02:02:17,299 --> 02:02:20,052
Except now, he got really crazy.

1188
02:02:23,807 --> 02:02:25,934
He started imagining all kinds of things.

1189
02:02:28,187 --> 02:02:29,146
Like what?

1190
02:02:31,691 --> 02:02:35,195
He started thinking
she was seeing other men on the sly.

1191
02:02:37,198 --> 02:02:39,576
He'd come home from work
and accuse her of...

1192
02:02:40,035 --> 02:02:42,372
Spending the day
with somebody else.

1193
02:02:42,747 --> 02:02:45,250
He'd yell at her
and break things in the trailer.

1194
02:02:48,379 --> 02:02:49,422
The trailer...

1195
02:02:54,969 --> 02:02:56,054
Yes.

1196
02:02:57,556 --> 02:02:59,391
They lived in a trailer home.

1197
02:03:14,909 --> 02:03:17,747
Excuse me sir, but were you
in this with me the other day?

1198
02:03:19,248 --> 02:03:20,624
I don't mean to pry...

1199
02:03:23,045 --> 02:03:23,920
No.

1200
02:03:25,714 --> 02:03:26,632
Oh...

1201
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:33,014
I thought I recognized
your voice for a minute.

1202
02:03:34,432 --> 02:03:35,351
No.

1203
02:03:36,310 --> 02:03:37,811
Wasn't me.

1204
02:03:38,479 --> 02:03:39,563
Uh huh...

1205
02:03:42,777 --> 02:03:43,903
Please go on.

1206
02:03:47,156 --> 02:03:50,452
Anyway... He started
to drink real bad.

1207
02:03:51,536 --> 02:03:54,164
He would stay out late to test her.

1208
02:03:56,542 --> 02:03:58,378
What do you mean, test her?

1209
02:03:59,462 --> 02:04:01,297
To see if she would get jealous.

1210
02:04:03,175 --> 02:04:05,260
Ha... uh huh.

1211
02:04:07,721 --> 02:04:11,142
He wanted her to get jealous.
But she didn't.

1212
02:04:11,559 --> 02:04:13,061
She just worried about him,

1213
02:04:14,105 --> 02:04:15,899
But that got him even madder.

1214
02:04:17,693 --> 02:04:18,860
Why?

1215
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:21,863
Because...

1216
02:04:23,116 --> 02:04:25,952
He thought that if she never got jealous of him
she didn't really care about him.

1217
02:04:27,787 --> 02:04:31,250
Jealousy was a sign of her love for him.

1218
02:04:32,209 --> 02:04:33,877
And then one night,

1219
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:38,091
One night she told him
that she was pregnant.

1220
02:04:39,009 --> 02:04:41,594
She was about 3 or 4 months pregnant.

1221
02:04:41,970 --> 02:04:43,681
And he didn't even know.

1222
02:04:44,390 --> 02:04:46,601
And then suddenly everything would change.

1223
02:04:47,686 --> 02:04:50,773
He stopped drinking,
and got a steady job.

1224
02:04:51,649 --> 02:04:53,609
He was convinced
that she loved him now,

1225
02:04:53,693 --> 02:04:55,863
Because she was carrying his child.

1226
02:04:56,822 --> 02:05:00,576
And he was going to dedicate himself
to making a home for her.

1227
02:05:01,827 --> 02:05:03,913
But a funny thing started to happen.

1228
02:05:04,456 --> 02:05:05,665
What?

1229
02:05:06,249 --> 02:05:08,543
He didn't even notice it at first.

1230
02:05:08,918 --> 02:05:10,880
She started to change.

1231
02:05:11,672 --> 02:05:13,215
From the day the baby was born.

1232
02:05:13,341 --> 02:05:15,969
She began to get irritated
with everything around her.

1233
02:05:16,511 --> 02:05:18,221
She got mad at everything.

1234
02:05:19,474 --> 02:05:22,477
Even the baby seemed
to be injustice to her.

1235
02:05:23,062 --> 02:05:25,689
He kept trying to make everything
alright for her,

1236
02:05:25,981 --> 02:05:27,441
Buy her things,

1237
02:05:27,441 --> 02:05:29,778
Take her out to dinner once a week.

1238
02:05:30,487 --> 02:05:32,530
But nothing seemed to satisfy her.

1239
02:05:33,323 --> 02:05:36,786
For two years, he struggled
to pull them back together,

1240
02:05:36,869 --> 02:05:39,246
Like the were when they first met.

1241
02:05:40,498 --> 02:05:44,336
But finally he knew
that it was never going to work out.

1242
02:05:46,463 --> 02:05:48,256
So he hit the bottle again.

1243
02:05:48,632 --> 02:05:50,843
But this time it got mean.

1244
02:05:51,929 --> 02:05:54,098
This time when he came home
late at night,

1245
02:05:54,431 --> 02:05:57,143
She wasn't worried about him,
or jealous.

1246
02:05:57,894 --> 02:06:00,063
She was just enraged.

1247
02:06:01,606 --> 02:06:03,943
She accused him of holding her captive.

1248
02:06:04,277 --> 02:06:06,113
By making her have a baby.

1249
02:06:08,156 --> 02:06:10,451
She told him
that she dreamed about escaping.

1250
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:13,913
That was all she dreamed about... Escape.

1251
02:06:15,123 --> 02:06:18,377
She saw herself at night,
running naked down a highway.

1252
02:06:19,044 --> 02:06:20,921
Running across fields.

1253
02:06:21,296 --> 02:06:22,966
Running down river beds.

1254
02:06:23,383 --> 02:06:24,635
Always running.

1255
02:06:25,094 --> 02:06:27,555
And always when she was
just about to get away...

1256
02:06:27,930 --> 02:06:29,223
He would be there.

1257
02:06:29,808 --> 02:06:31,476
He would stop her somehow.

1258
02:06:33,228 --> 02:06:35,147
He would just appear and stop her.

1259
02:06:38,609 --> 02:06:42,238
And when she told him these dreams,
He believed them.

1260
02:06:43,198 --> 02:06:44,616
He knew she had to be stopped,

1261
02:06:44,783 --> 02:06:46,410
Or she would leave him forever.

1262
02:06:47,327 --> 02:06:49,621
So he tied a cow bell to her ankle,

1263
02:06:49,956 --> 02:06:52,917
So he could hear at night
if she tried to get out of bed.

1264
02:06:54,044 --> 02:06:57,758
But she learned how to muffle the bell,
by stuffing a sock into it.

1265
02:06:58,091 --> 02:07:00,552
And inching her way
out of the bed...

1266
02:07:01,136 --> 02:07:02,637
And into the night.

1267
02:07:04,223 --> 02:07:06,100
He caught her one night
when the sock fell out.

1268
02:07:06,267 --> 02:07:08,603
And he heard her
trying to run to the high way.

1269
02:07:08,770 --> 02:07:12,983
He caught her, dragged her
back to the trailer, and tied her to the stove,

1270
02:07:13,108 --> 02:07:14,651
With his belt.

1271
02:07:16,570 --> 02:07:17,906
He just left her there.

1272
02:07:18,490 --> 02:07:19,949
And went back to bed.

1273
02:07:21,409 --> 02:07:23,454
And lay there listing to her scream.

1274
02:07:25,164 --> 02:07:27,375
Then he'd listen to his son's scream.

1275
02:07:29,585 --> 02:07:34,092
And he was surprised at himself
because he didn't feel anything anymore.

1276
02:07:36,552 --> 02:07:39,264
All he wanted to do was sleep.

1277
02:07:41,558 --> 02:07:45,563
And for the first time,
he wished he were far away.

1278
02:07:49,526 --> 02:07:53,197
Lost in a deep vast country
where nobody knew him.

1279
02:07:54,448 --> 02:07:56,158
Somewhere without language.

1280
02:07:57,285 --> 02:07:58,620
Or streets.

1281
02:08:00,080 --> 02:08:02,875
And he dreamed about this place
without knowing it's name.

1282
02:08:04,169 --> 02:08:05,546
And when he woke up,

1283
02:08:06,046 --> 02:08:07,464
He was on fire.

1284
02:08:10,427 --> 02:08:13,430
There were blue flames
among the sheets of his bed.

1285
02:08:14,514 --> 02:08:16,349
He ran through the flames,

1286
02:08:17,351 --> 02:08:19,437
Toward the only two people he loved.

1287
02:08:20,980 --> 02:08:22,356
But they were gone.

1288
02:08:25,610 --> 02:08:26,945
His arms were burning.

1289
02:08:27,237 --> 02:08:29,156
And he threw himself outside...

1290
02:08:31,200 --> 02:08:33,036
And rolled on the wet ground.

1291
02:08:36,081 --> 02:08:37,417
Then he ran.

1292
02:08:39,335 --> 02:08:41,421
He never looked back at the fire.

1293
02:08:44,383 --> 02:08:45,718
He just ran.

1294
02:08:52,476 --> 02:08:54,519
He ran until the sun came up.

1295
02:08:56,396 --> 02:08:58,316
And he couldn't run any further.

1296
02:09:00,651 --> 02:09:02,403
And when the sun went down...

1297
02:09:03,196 --> 02:09:04,865
He ran again.

1298
02:09:11,123 --> 02:09:13,459
For five days he ran like this.

1299
02:09:15,628 --> 02:09:17,672
Until every sign of man...

1300
02:09:20,717 --> 02:09:22,219
Has disappeared.

1301
02:09:33,650 --> 02:09:34,984
Travis.

1302
02:10:18,203 --> 02:10:19,872
If you turn the light off in there,

1303
02:10:20,205 --> 02:10:21,707
Would you be able to see me?

1304
02:10:29,841 --> 02:10:30,925
I don't know.

1305
02:10:36,307 --> 02:10:37,725
I never tried.

1306
02:10:56,956 --> 02:10:58,167
Can you see me?

1307
02:11:00,836 --> 02:11:02,129
Yeah.

1308
02:11:03,589 --> 02:11:05,008
Do you recognize me?

1309
02:11:07,969 --> 02:11:09,513
Oh, Travis.

1310
02:11:17,105 --> 02:11:19,149
I brought Hunter with me.

1311
02:11:31,748 --> 02:11:33,083
Don't you want to see him?

1312
02:11:36,253 --> 02:11:37,295
Yeah.

1313
02:11:46,765 --> 02:11:51,061
I wanted to see him so bad
that I didn't even dare imagine him anymore.

1314
02:11:57,319 --> 02:11:59,823
Ann kept sending me pictures of him.

1315
02:12:03,118 --> 02:12:05,079
Until I asked her to stop.

1316
02:12:11,879 --> 02:12:13,297
I couldn't stand...

1317
02:12:14,548 --> 02:12:17,634
The pain of seeing him
grow up and missing it.

1318
02:12:26,897 --> 02:12:29,524
Why didn't you keep him with you, Jane?

1319
02:12:32,945 --> 02:12:34,489
I couldn't, Travis.

1320
02:12:39,161 --> 02:12:41,747
I didn't have what I knew he needed.

1321
02:12:48,797 --> 02:12:52,218
I didn't want to use him
to fill all my emptiness.

1322
02:12:57,934 --> 02:12:59,686
Well he needs you now, Jane.

1323
02:13:00,562 --> 02:13:02,022
And he wants to see you.

1324
02:13:02,439 --> 02:13:03,399
He does?

1325
02:13:06,820 --> 02:13:07,737
Yes.

1326
02:13:12,785 --> 02:13:14,995
He's waiting for you...

1327
02:13:15,538 --> 02:13:16,497
Where?

1328
02:13:19,876 --> 02:13:21,044
Downtown.

1329
02:13:22,504 --> 02:13:23,713
In a hotel.

1330
02:13:26,342 --> 02:13:27,510
The Meridian.

1331
02:13:30,179 --> 02:13:32,182
Room 1520.

1332
02:13:39,984 --> 02:13:41,735
You're not going, are you?

1333
02:13:57,587 --> 02:13:59,423
I can't see you Jane.

1334
02:14:01,967 --> 02:14:03,386
Don't go yet.

1335
02:14:08,350 --> 02:14:09,685
Don't go yet.

1336
02:14:28,665 --> 02:14:30,125
I...

1337
02:14:32,712 --> 02:14:36,175
I used to make up long speeches
to you after you left.

1338
02:14:41,389 --> 02:14:43,558
I used to talk to you all the time.

1339
02:14:44,184 --> 02:14:45,727
Even though I was alone.

1340
02:14:49,816 --> 02:14:52,401
I walked around for months
talking to you.

1341
02:14:57,407 --> 02:15:00,161
Now, I don't know what to say.

1342
02:15:04,499 --> 02:15:07,378
It was easier when I just imagined you.

1343
02:15:15,513 --> 02:15:18,057
I even imagined you
talking back to me.

1344
02:15:23,063 --> 02:15:25,441
We'd have long conversations.

1345
02:15:27,444 --> 02:15:28,987
The two of us.

1346
02:15:32,992 --> 02:15:35,578
It was almost like you were there.

1347
02:15:39,958 --> 02:15:41,461
I would hear you.

1348
02:15:41,961 --> 02:15:43,671
I would see you, smell you.

1349
02:15:46,048 --> 02:15:47,676
I could hear your voice.

1350
02:15:51,096 --> 02:15:53,391
Sometimes your voice would wake me up.

1351
02:15:57,020 --> 02:16:00,816
It would wake me up in the middle of the night
just like you were there in the room with me.

1352
02:16:09,493 --> 02:16:10,452
Then...

1353
02:16:14,166 --> 02:16:16,210
It slowly faded.

1354
02:16:18,338 --> 02:16:20,382
I couldn't picture you anymore.

1355
02:16:24,553 --> 02:16:27,891
I tried to talk out loud to you
like I used to,

1356
02:16:27,891 --> 02:16:29,684
But there was no one there.

1357
02:16:33,606 --> 02:16:35,525
I couldn't hear you.

1358
02:16:41,323 --> 02:16:42,449
Then...

1359
02:16:48,207 --> 02:16:49,583
I just gave up.

1360
02:16:56,633 --> 02:16:58,260
Everything stopped.

1361
02:17:00,471 --> 02:17:01,514
You.

1362
02:17:06,185 --> 02:17:07,729
Just disappeared.

1363
02:17:14,529 --> 02:17:16,489
Now I'm working here.

1364
02:17:22,289 --> 02:17:24,499
I hear your voice all the time.

1365
02:17:30,715 --> 02:17:32,300
Every man...

1366
02:17:33,342 --> 02:17:34,970
Has your voice.

1367
02:17:54,494 --> 02:17:56,037
I'll tell Hunter...

1368
02:17:57,079 --> 02:17:58,414
That you are coming.

1369
02:18:02,920 --> 02:18:04,630
- Travis.
- What?

1370
02:18:09,135 --> 02:18:10,470
I'll be there.

1371
02:18:15,976 --> 02:18:16,852
Good.

1372
02:18:22,776 --> 02:18:25,321
- Meridian hotel...
- Yeah.

1373
02:18:30,160 --> 02:18:31,370
Room...

1374
02:19:45,791 --> 02:19:47,084
Oh, you little...

1375
02:21:23,407 --> 02:21:24,617
Your hair.

1376
02:21:25,075 --> 02:21:26,327
It's wet...
