this constant nagging.

It's like you're turning into
one of your sisters.

4
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,800
And I'm tired of your drinking

5
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,096
and feeling sorry for yourself.

6
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,553

for the number of young
lrish people coming to London

25
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,759
in search of work, the crude
indications that do exist

26
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,433
show an enormous increase.

27
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,516
Many take the boat
with barely enough money

28
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,837
to survive a few days in
London, but still they emigrate

29
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,632
because they see hope
across the sea,

00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,398
hope they cannot see
in lreland.

31
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,435
This meeting has been called
to order.

32
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,357
Pray proceed.

33
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,392
Well, as some of you
may have noticed,

34
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,794
your mother and I really are

35
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,400
under a lot of pressure
at the moment.

36
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,919
Like the rest of the country.

37
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,760
I haven't had a single
commission this year.

38
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,831
Your mother is down
to a three-day week.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,275
It doesn't look like it's going
to get much brighter.

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,072
So we had a look
at our accounts,

41
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,873
and... well, we-we see we
could make a significant saving

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,958
if we altered
the education situation.

43
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,798
What education situation?

44
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,558
- Well...
- She means your school.

45
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,233
They're taking you
out of school.

46
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,713
- What?
- No, no.

47
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,319
We're not taking you
out of school.

48
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,635
We're transferring you
from one school

49
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,591
- to another school.
- Why?

50
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,976
Because we need to make some
cuts in the budget somewhere.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,736
I'd suggest taking
your brother out of college,

52
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,496
but he's already dropped out
of his own volition.

53
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,748
Thank you, Robert.

54
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,919
The Christian Brothers have
a fine history of education.

55
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,314
Who are the Christian Brothers?

56
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,176
The Christian Brothers
are an educational institution

57
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,856
- formed by...
- The Christian Brothers, Conor,

58
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,240
are an order
of the Catholic Church

59
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,239
self-appointed
in their education formation

60
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,874
and systematic beating
of their young charges.

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,194
Oh, shut up, Brendan.

62
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,496
Six years in the hands
of the Jesuits,

63
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,078
and look what they did for you.

64
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,395
You're just gonna have
to face up to this, Conor.

65
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,136
Do you know what the
Christian Brothers' motto is?

66
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,229
"Viriliter Age."

67
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,759
Do you know what that means?

68
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,920
"Let's rape our students"?

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,592
No, Brendan, it doesn't.

70
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,359
It means "act manly."

71
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,000
What are you doing?
Get out of the bleedin' way.

72
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,551
Morning, Brother Baxter.

73
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,119
Sit down.

74
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,754
- French, Brother Barnabas.
- Huh?

75
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,677
You're teaching French,
not Latin.

76
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,438
Oh, how modern.

77
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,629
Mind you, I'd be surprised

78
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,096
if any of you knew
where France is,

79
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,395
not to mind speaking
the language.

80
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,635
Oh, go on.

81
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,274
It's on the continent.

82
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,356
Above Spain.

83
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,950
You'll be the new lad, then,
from the Jesuits.

84
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
What's your name?

85
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,874
Conor Lawlor.

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,230
- Ooh! -Conor Lawlor?
- Shut up!

87
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,920
Right, Conor. Morning prayers
are at quarter to 9:00.

88
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,190
The canteen is located
just below the PE hall.

89
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,880
They serve chips and bars.

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,468
We have a strict black-shoe
policy here, Mr. Lawlor.

91
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,670
Your parents should have
read it in the introductory

92
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,836
rule book, page 142.

93
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,150
I don't have black shoes, sir.

94
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,477
Well, you're just going to have
to get a pair then, aren't you?

95
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,875
And report to me first thing
in the morning with them.

96
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,598
Good man.

97
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,948
Brother.

98
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,150
As you were.

99
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,589
Sorry.

100
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,518
Where did he say
the restaurant was again?

101
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,119
Do you mean the canteen?

102
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,719
Of course,
the can-canteen, yeah.

103
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,432
"The restaurant."

104
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,440
You're not in France now,
you bleedin' spanner.

105
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,078
Do you smoke?

106
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,077
- Do you?
- Occasionally.

107
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,832
I'm not really a smoker.

108
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,712
My brother is.
Uh, sometimes steal

109
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,296
a bit of his tobacco
when my friends are over.

110
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,515
So do you want to have
a smoke then or...?

111
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,154
- Here? -Come on, we'll have
a smoke. Come on, follow me.

112
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,952
Come on.

113
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,433
Here, do you want one?

114
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,754
Nah, I'm okay.

115
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,638
I already had two this morning.

116
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,552
Actually, look at this yoke.

117
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,830
It's a Black Widow.

118
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,029
Savage.

119
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,074
- Now, I hear you're a queer.
- What?

120
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,713
Yeah, I hear
you're a little queer.

121
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,035
No, you must have me mixed up
with someone else.

122
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,752
Nah, I don't think so.

123
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,711
Dance.

124
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,432
- Dance?
- Dance!

125
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,993
Dance, like a little queer, go.

126
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
Are you joking?

127
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,559
Jig.

128
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,352
Move it.

129
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,993
No, more arms.

130
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,720
Uh, yeah, disco, kind of.

131
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,751
Now dance with your pants down.

132
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,915
What?

133
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,917
Hmm. Get into that cubicle,

134
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,315
dance with your pants down.

135
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,839
No.

136
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,359
What did you just say?

137
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,677
Uh, I'm not,
I'm not doing that.

138
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,237
It's Thursday.

139
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,839
It's 7:00.

140
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,076
It's Top of the Pops.

141
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,273
Conor, Brendan,
come on, it's 7:00!

142
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,760
They can't be here tonight,

143
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,518
as they are in the USA,

144
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,110
so instead we have
to go to Rio.

145
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,071
It's Duran Duran.

146
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,976
Hey, we're working here.

147
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,309
So are we.

148
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,919
This is my homework, Brendan.

149
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,736
I have a really important essay
due in the morning.

150
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,336
Just because you've given up
on your dreams

151
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,396
doesn't mean we have to,
all right?

152
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,999
Can we put the fire on?

153
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,838
No.

154
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,633
You're gonna love this, man.

155
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,591
Yes! Beautiful.

156
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,234
The jury's still out
on which way these guys'll go,

157
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,391
but they're a lot of fun,
and John Taylor

158
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,136
is one of the most proficient
bass players

159
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,957
in the UK at the moment.

160
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,354
Gives them a really funky edge,

161
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,800
which I hope
they're gonna go for.

162
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,233
Hey, it's not exactly
the Beatles, is it?

163
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,016
Oh, you know, will you go
outside and start up

164
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,776
the time machine there
so we can all go back in time

165
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,680
- for Dad, Conor.
- Well, if this is the future,

166
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,320
we're all screwed, aren't we?
I mean, look at this guy.

167
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,998
He's not even singing live.

168
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,394
It's a video, Robert.

169
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,033
It's art.

170
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,355
Everybody's making them
these days. Look at it.

171
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,955
He's very attractive, though,
isn't he?

172
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,080
You're welcome to him.

173
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,349
Promise?

174
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,192
Who's that guitarist?

175
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,395
John Taylor.

176
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,589
All the girls love him.

177
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,472
Cute, isn't he, Ann?

178
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,669
And he's not a guitarist.

179
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,394
- He's a bassist.
- Yeah, Ann.

180
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,280
I mean, why can't they
get them to play live?

181
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,713
What are they trying to hide?

182
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,114
It's because
they're in the USA.

183
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,240
Did you not hear him?

184
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,111
And this lasts forever.

185
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,994
It's the perfect mixture
of music and visuals.

186
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,872
It's short, to the point.

187
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,319
Look at it.

188
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,872
I mean, what tyranny
could stand up to that?

189
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,477
Good morning, Mr. Lawlor.

190
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,230
Well, I brought it up
with my mum, but she said

191
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,511
we can't afford another pair
at the moment.

192
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,238
I bought these before I knew
about the shoe color policy

193
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,749
here at Synge Street.

194
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,559
But it's not as if
they're runners or something.

195
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,033
They're... they're brown.

196
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,435
They're-they're quite sensible.

197
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,994
They're not black.

198
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,317
I'm-I'm not sure
what you want me to do.

199
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,078
Take them off.

200
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,316
You can leave them
at the door there.

201
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,311
Seeing as you're so fond
of them,

202
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,040
you can pick them up here
at 4:00 every day

203
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,628
until you comply with the rules
of the school.

204
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,557
What?

205
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,477
See you.

206
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,351
Could I have
a Mars bar, please?

207
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,078
25p.

208
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,509
Thank you.

209
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,592
Here.

210
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,079
Ooh!

211
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,959
You should've just danced.

212
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,508
Who is that psycho?

213
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,153
That's Barry Bray.

214
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,999
- He'll be out for your blood
for the year. -Why?

215
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,951
'Cause you've shown
signs of weakness.

216
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,832
So how do you know him?

217
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,678
He lives
in the same flat as me.

218
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,472
His ma and da
are drugs addicts.

219
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,999
But don't worry.

220
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,276
You just need to come up
with a plan for the year.

221
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,594
A solution.

222
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,518
Here.

223
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,596
Check it out.

224
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,393
"Darren Mulvey
Business Solutions."

225
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,839
Call me anytime.

226
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,995
There's no number on it.

227
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,320
Oh, no, we don't have a phone.

228
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,793
Just call around, yeah?

229
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,435
Who's she?

230
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,879
I don't know.

231
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,513
She's always there.

232
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,352
She's beautiful.

233
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,629
Yeah, good luck.

234
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,239
She doesn't speak to anyone.

235
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,679
Stuck-up cow.

236
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,472
She said her boyfriend's
a drug dealer.

237
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,416
She's not interested
in any of the boys in school.

238
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,591
Then why is she standing
over there every morning, then?

239
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,273
Need a light?

240
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,078
No. I'm trying to give up.

241
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,350
I don't have
any matches anyway.

242
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,117
So, how come
you're not in school?

243
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,832
I don't go to school.

244
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,109
I'm a model.

245
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,117
Cool, like, for magazines?

246
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,037
I'm going to London soon.

247
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,071
Just waiting
for my portfolio shots.

248
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,033
There's no real work
for models in Dublin, you know?

249
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,709
Yeah, tell me about it.

250
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,354
Do you want to be in a video?

251
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,708
It's for my band.

252
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,637
You're in a band?

253
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,354
Yes, and we need
a girl for it.

254
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,311
Have you ever been
in a video before?

255
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,509
No.

256
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,790
Is that a problem?

257
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,194
I hope not.

258
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,435
I'll ask the producer.

259
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,754
Who's the producer?

260
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,757
That kid behind me.

261
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,349
I could call you
with the details,

262
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,192
if I had your digits.

263
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,230
So, if you're in a band,
sing me a song.

264
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,630
I can't sing out here.

265
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,069
You're gonna have to sing for,
like, thousands of people.

266
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,559
I'm just one.

267
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,680
Sing.

268
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,478
Don't make me sing.

269
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,556
Jesus.

270
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,908
Sing that song off the radio.

271
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,354
You know, the one by A-ha.

272
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,391
Sing it.

273
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,556
Sing it.

274
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,318
♪ Take... ♪ Sorry.

275
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,509
♪ Take... ♪

276
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,640
No, it's too low.

277
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,430
♪ Take on me ♪

278
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,351
♪ Take me on. ♪

279
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,238
That's all I know.

280
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,712
Cool, bye.

281
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,869
- We need to form a band.
- What?

282
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,359
How are you, Darren?

283
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,913
- Is Eamon there?
- Eamon?

284
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,520
Hey, Eamon.

285
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,715
What are you doing?

286
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,955
Nothing really.

287
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,433
Just feeding me new bunny.

288
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,160
Conor, this is Eamon.
Eamon, this is Conor.

289
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,976
Conor's new in school, and
he's putting a band together.

290
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,719
Oh, good Jesus.

291
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,637
So?

292
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,428
Wow.

293
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,834
Where'd you get all this gear?

294
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,632
Me da's in a covers band.

295
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,955
Weddings, parties, pubs.

296
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,736
Eamon can play every instrument
known to mankind.

297
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,352
Can't you, Eamon?

298
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,072
Probably.

299
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,519
Show him.

300
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,989
Check it.

301
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,600
So what do you think...

302
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,550
So, what do you play yourself?

303
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,868
I'm more of a singer.

304
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,838
I write songs, words, lyrics.

305
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,195
But I haven't put them
to music yet.

306
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,696
What kind of music
are yous gonna be doing?

307
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,472
Well, I-I don't know yet.

308
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,874
What d'you mean you don't know?

309
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,096
You have to know
what you're gonna be playing.

310
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,599
What are you into?

311
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,034
I'm a futurist.

312
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,912
What does that mean?

313
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,031
Like, uh, no nostalgia.

314
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,912
Not like your da's band.

315
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,837
Not looking backwards,
just forwards.

316
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,155
Oh, cool. Like Depeche Mode?

317
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,555
- Okay.
- Or Joy Division?

318
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,511
Right.

319
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,993
Or Duran Duran?

320
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,951
What do you think of them?

321
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,072
Jury is out on which way
those guys'll go.

322
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,792
They're a lot of fun,
and James Taylor

323
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,592
is one of the most
proficient bass players

324
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,030
in the UK at the moment,
giving them a funky edge.

325
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,709
John Taylor.

326
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,836
Yeah, John. Of course.

327
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,239
I'll be in your band.

328
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,554
I'll play guitar.

329
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,438
And I'll help write songs.

330
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,999
We could rehearse here

331
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,076
'cause my da's
in Saint John of Gods.

332
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,792
- Is that a pub?
- No, Darren.

333
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,150
It's a place where alcoholics
go to get off the drink,

334
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,077
stop beating up
their wives and kids.

335
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,474
Right.

336
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,113
And neighbors.

337
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,878
Who's gonna be the manager?

338
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,797
Me.

339
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,353
Have you managed bands before?

340
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,072
No, I'm just breaking
into the market.

341
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,456
Got to get everything straight.

342
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,913
Get everything down
on paper first.

343
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,376
Otherwise,
the major record labels

344
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,656
can rip you off
when they come hunting.

345
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,318
That's what me da says.

346
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,554
When'd you want to rehearse?

347
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,477
Not at the weekends.

348
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,456
He's got a job packing shelves
in Quinnsworth on Saturdays.

349
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,096
You're not giving that up
for any band, d'you hear me?

350
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,519
Yeah.

351
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,517
What about Mondays
and Wednesdays after school?

352
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,908
That's fine.

353
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,917
Sounds good.

354
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,473
Now all we need
is other musicians.

355
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,755
Do yous know any?

356
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,598
- No.
- Eamon?

357
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,233
He usually just plays
on his own.

358
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,360
Don't you, love?

359
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,674
Right, well,

360
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,074
we can't get
any peace in here.

361
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,555
Let's continue
this meeting outside.

362
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,233
No smoking now.

363
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,351
Ma, how many times
do I have to tell you?

364
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,754
I don't smoke.

365
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,114
There's a black guy in 3B.

366
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,639
So?

367
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,671
- Be cool if he was in the band.
- Why?

368
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,616
He's probably the one black guy
in the whole school.

369
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,278
Probably in Dublin.

370
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,360
Having a golliwog in the band
give us a real edge.

371
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,509
You can't say "golliwog."

372
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,834
Why not?

373
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,359
Trust me, you just can't.

374
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,160
And anyway, what if
he can't play anything?

375
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,356
He'll be able
to play something; he's black.

376
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,111
- Wow.
- Can I help you?

377
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,316
Is this the house
where the colored lad lives?

378
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,509
Four doors down.

379
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,039
What do you think?

380
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,416
How many black people
do you think

381
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,919
that lives
on this shitty estate?

382
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,116
- Do you know Ngig?
- What's that?

383
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,515
Ngig. My son.

384
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,000
We're putting a band together.
Does he play any instruments?

385
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,951
Why don't you ask him yourself?

386
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,389
We are putting

387
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,274
a band together.

388
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,039
I am the manager.

389
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,912
What the hell
is wrong with him?

390
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,590
Oh, you, um,
sound different from your mam.

391
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,256
Course I do; been here
half me bleedin' life.

392
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,429
What'd you think?

393
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,596
Would you have any interest
in playing in a band?

394
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,199
What kind of music
are yous playing?

395
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,191
We're not
a hundred percent sure yet,

396
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,032
but do you play
any instruments?

397
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,069
Maybe.

398
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,789
"Futurist band forming.

399
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,672
Looking for
a bass player, drummer."

400
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,949
That's us.

401
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,872
"Influences include
Depeche Mode,

402
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,359
Duran Duran and many more."

403
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,277
- Faggots.
- Piss off, Ryan.

404
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,313
"Contact Management Solutions,
361 at St. Theresa's Gardens.

405
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,668
No telephone, just call in."

406
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,512
Sounds like a gig for us.

407
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,834
Let's go.

408
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,436
So what are we called, then?

409
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,192
All right, what about...

410
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,639
The Rabbits?

411
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,591
What's the story
with you and rabbits?

412
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,517
I don't know, I just love them.

413
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,710
What about La Vie?

414
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,114
What's that mean?

415
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,878
It's French for "The Life."

416
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,416
What's French for, uh,
"That's not gonna be

417
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,509
the name of the band"?

418
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,756
C'est nes pas le nom du groupe.

419
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,880
There you go.

420
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,388
What about... Sing Street?

421
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,750
Do you actually not
get that like?

422
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,233
Sing Street.

423
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,679
- Oh!
- I like that.

424
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,075
- Gobshites.
- Yeah, I like it.

- Really?

438
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,829
- That sounded great.
- Yeah, we sound deadly.

439
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,315
Oh, lads, we're gonna be amazing.

440
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,992
What are you doing?

441
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,840
I'm just letting
the stink of that out, man.

442
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,069
Whew.

443
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,838
That was bad, bad music.

444
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,270
And there is nothing as bad
in this world as bad music.

445
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,675
- You know you can record
over tapes? -No.

446
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,839
That was a novelty act.

447
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,076
You want to have actual
sexual intercourse, right?

448
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,918
- Yeah. What, what?
- The girl.

449
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,376
It's all about the girl,
isn't it?

450
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,550
- Yeah, the girl, yeah.
- And you're gonna use

451
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,336
somebody else's art to get her?
Are you kidding?

452
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,395
We're just starting.

453
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,919
We need to learn how to play.

454
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,632
Did the Sex Pistols
know how to play?

455
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,496
You don't need to know
how to play. Who are you?

456
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,478
Steely Dan? You need to learn
how not to play, Conor.

457
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,756
That's the trick.
That's rock and roll.

458
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,030
And that takes practice.

459
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,230
And you're not a covers band,
by the way.

460
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,634
- Really?
- No.

461
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,193
Every school has a covers band.

462
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,992
Every pub has a covers band.

463
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,553
Every wedding
has a covers band.

464
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,716
And every covers band
has a middle-aged member

465
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,496
who'll never know
whether they could've made it

466
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,640
in the music industry or not

467
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,976
because they never
had the balls

468
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,319
to write a song
for someone else.

469
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,556
Rock and roll is a risk.

470
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,194
You risk being ridiculed.

471
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,736
But I don't know
how to write a song.

472
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,920
Close that door and sit down.

473
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,456
- Really?
- It's gonna be a long night.

474
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,560
I've school in the morning.

475
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,034
This is school.

476
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,037
"She's standing on the corner

477
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,912
"like an angel in disguise.

478
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,759
"I want to try and warn her.

479
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,519
She's got dangerous eyes."

480
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,591
"Dangerous eyes."

481
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,438
I like that.

482
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,999
What does it mean?

483
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,792
I don't know.

484
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,319
What's the song about, Conor?

485
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,357
It's like
when you don't know someone,

486
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,072
they're more interesting.

487
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,430
They can be
anything you want them to be.

488
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,560
Yeah.

489
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,871
But when you know them,

490
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,353
there's limits to them.

491
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,675
No, that doesn't make
any sense.

492
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,597
What's it called?

493
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,472
"The Riddle of the Model."

494
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,431
So what about a rhythm
like this?

495
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,397
Nice.

496
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,839
Slow it down a little.

497
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,556
Yeah.

498
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,955
Yeah, that's cool, that's it.

Maybe for the chorus,
like, a...

505
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,072
Yeah.

506
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,190
Yeah. There you can do a stop.

Check out this effect.

524
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,152
It's like "Video Killed
the Radio Star."

How's it going?

530
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,874
Uh, here's the tape.

531
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,672
What's this?

532
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,995
Oh, that's the song;
I mentioned it to you.

533
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,759
Oh, you're the kid in the band.

534
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,197
Yeah, you should probably
learn the lyrics.

535
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,151
So you can lip-sync
to them properly.

536
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,336
We're shooting at the lane
at the back of Quinnsworth.

537
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,952
- You know Quinnsworth?
- Yeah.

538
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,115
This Saturday at 12:00.

539
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,510
Cool. Well, I'll try
and make it.

540
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,675
What would I wear?

541
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,994
I don't know.

542
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,513
It's kind of like
a Chinese theme.

543
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,312
So, like, a kimono?

544
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,635
Well, it's more like a riff
than a song.

545
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,911
More of an Eastern bit
in the song.

546
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,508
It's called
"The Riddle of the Model."

547
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,434
That's really sweet.

548
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,595
Oh.

549
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,432
No, it's not about you.

550
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,039
It's about another model
I know.

551
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,593
Oh.

552
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,392
Right, well,
I'll give it a listen,

553
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,916
but I'm, like, really,
really busy at the moment.

554
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,598
You know, so I'll try.

555
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,473
Yeah, you should.
It's a, it's a good song.

556
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,160
We've got a great team.

557
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,231
It's a really good opportunity.

558
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,588
Cool.

559
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,199
So this Saturday
at 12:00, then?

560
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,550
12:00. Sounds good.

561
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,829
- Thanks.
- Cool.

562
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,757
Bye.

563
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,313
Looks like loads of gear
back home, doesn't it?

564
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,477
And yet, strangely,
it just looks like shit here.

565
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,636
Yeah.

566
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,751
Ah, hey, where is this chick?

567
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,638
I don't know.

568
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,228
Who the hell
brought a cowboy costume?

569
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,794
Me. It's all I could find.

570
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,036
No one wears
a cowboy costume in a band.

571
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,536
There's a cowboy
in the Village People.

572
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,560
And Adam Ant.

573
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,358
Adam Ant is a highwayman.

574
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,597
So we can have a highwayman,
but we can't have a cowboy?

575
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,711
Are you mentally ill?

576
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,990
I got fangs in the joke shop.

577
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,000
What are you gonna do with them?

578
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,873
It's a music video,

579
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,996
- not a bleedin' horror film.
- Spanner.

580
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,350
So what did yous bring?

581
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,353
It's me da's show band outfit.

582
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,629
So it's a gay band?

583
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,760
Okay.

584
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,016
Coming from the one who wants

585
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,359
to look like
the Village People.

586
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,920
What's gay about
the Village People?

587
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,399
Hello, all. Sorry I'm late.

588
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,073
I was out last night.

589
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,350
At a nightclub.

590
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,710
Jesus Christ,
what are you all wearing?

591
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,831
Yeah, we're just
working that out.

592
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,439
Um, maybe you can help.

593
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,073
Well, who's your
costume person?

594
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,312
We don't really have
a costume person.

595
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,456
Well, who's your cameraman?

596
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,710
Maybe he can make
some of this work.

597
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,478
Well, we don't really have...

598
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,669
I'm the cameraman.

599
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,000
Thought you were the producer.

600
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,348
And the cameraman.

601
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,118
Saving money
at all costs, yeah.

602
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,593
What'd you think of the song?

603
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,835
I really liked it.

604
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,598
It's the only reason I'm here.

605
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,869
Did you write it?

606
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,433
Eamon wrote most of the music.

607
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,913
So you wrote the lyrics?

608
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,155
Cool.

609
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,313
You've got
really good cheekbones.

610
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,759
- What?
- Yeah.

611
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,599
Yeah, you should let me
do your makeup.

612
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,836
- Really? -Yeah.
Now this light's gonna be

613
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,029
really harsh on camera.

614
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,599
It'll take the edge off.

615
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,278
I'm actually
wearing some right now.

616
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,714
In fact,

617
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,273
you should all
be wearing makeup.

618
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,896
Yeah,
I'm not wearing any makeup.

619
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,672
Relax,
you're not even in the band.

620
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,279
Yeah, thank God.

621
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,913
I'm in the band, and I will not

622
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,598
be wearing any makeup.
Thank you.

623
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,113
Why? You've got great lips.

624
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,680
No, piss off.
I'm not wearing makeup.

625
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,312
Whatever.

626
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,237
Those of you who actually
care about the band

627
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,033
and want to do this half
properly, queue over there.

628
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,913
Okay, so we're playing
over here,

629
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,736
and Raphina's standing
over there against the wall.

630
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,320
I go up to you
and start singing to you.

631
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,038
Make sure to pan up to her eyes

632
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,896
when I sing the line,
"She's got dangerous eyes."

633
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,433
I think a zoom would be better.

634
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,118
Okay, a zoom, whatever.

635
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,776
Do you think I should have,
like, lightning flashes

636
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,313
on my eyelids when I close 'em?

637
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,440
Can you do that?

638
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,675
I can do anything.

639
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,233
Cool.

640
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,749
So then for the chorus,
you walk off and I follow,

641
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,480
circling you like
when he's following her

642
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,560
in the "Thriller" video.

643
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,557
- Have you seen the "Thriller" video?
- Yeah.

644
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,511
Cool. So then I follow you
up the laneway,

645
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,976
keeping behind you,
and then we'll swing around

646
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,319
and get the angle in front.

647
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,280
- Let's shoot it.
- Right, let's shoot.

648
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,157
It's just some kids
filming something.

649
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,838
What are yous filming, lads?

650
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,679
A video for a band.

651
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,915
Hi, Barry.

652
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,519
Are these
in your school, Barry?

653
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,756
Yeah, they are, yeah.

654
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,438
But they're wearing
bleedin' makeup.

655
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,754
I know.

656
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,216
Oh, yous making a movie,
lads, is it?

657
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,593
Nah, it's just
a video for a band.

658
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,073
You should get
in a band, Barry.

659
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,071
Put on lipstick,
dance around and all.

660
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,196
- You'd be bleedin' great.
- Piss off.

661
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,436
- What did you say?
- Nothin'.

662
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,079
See yous, lads.

663
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,599
See yous at the Oscars.

664
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,270
Right, lads,
lots of energy in this.

665
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,600
And, Ngig, I want to see you
really pressing those keys.

666
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,035

Why don't we go eat these
in the park?

700
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,115
There you go.

701
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,753
- Thank you.
- No problem.

702
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,152
Can I spin you home?

703
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,714
I didn't know you had a car.

704
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,028
So where d'you live?

705
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,594
Not far from the school.
Harcourt Terrace.

706
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,039
Ah, by the canal.

707
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,434
Did you grow up there?

708
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,391
Yeah. Though we're
probably moving.

709
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,714
My parents are broke.

710
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,432
That's why they sent me
to that school.

711
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,959
Yeah, I was wondering
about that.

712
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,911
You're a bit posh
for around there.

713
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,031
Speak for yourself.
Your house is massive.

714
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,872
Is it?

715
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,592
My parents
are probably splitting up.

716
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,312
That's sad.
Are you doing okay with it?

717
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,759
Oh, yeah.

718
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,296
It's a bit intense
being around them.

719
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,595
Jesus, all that drama.

720
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,631
I'm glad I don't have parents.

721
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,955
Haven't we been down
this square already?

722
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,036
Uh, no.

723
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,918
You are the slowest cyclist
I have ever met.

724
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,359
Okay.

725
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,277
Thanks.

726
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,550
- That was great fun.
- Yeah, it was really fun.

727
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,074
Hey, baby!

728
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,349
Hi.

729
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,596
- This is Evan Adams.
- Word.

730
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,160
- How do you do?
- This is the singer

731
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,496
in the band
I was telling you about.

732
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,158
Oh, yeah,
she played me your song.

733
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,508
Good vibes.

734
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,710
Little bit of Duran Duran
in there,

735
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,273
bit of New Romance.

736
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,720
What style would you say
you were?

737
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,233
I'm a futurist.

738
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,475
Epic.

739
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,835
See you in the future, then.

740
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,394
- Ready, baby?
- Yeah.

741
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,600
- Okay.
- I'll see you soon.

742
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,477
See you.

743
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,477
Let's make
another video sometime.

744
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,353
Nice blouse!

745
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,357
Aw, shit.

746
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,909
You have to imagine
it's not as...

747
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,031
Shit?

748
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,513
This will be good.

749
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,312
- Really?
- Yeah.

750
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,635
You just need some proper
cameras and a good director.

751
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,840
But as long as it's in
your head, that's what counts.

752
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,717
It's an exercise
in imagination.

753
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,559
Think big, Conor.
This is just a means to an end.

754
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,033
And she looks amazing.

755
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,832
She's got to be
in all the videos.

756
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,836
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

757
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,518
She's world-class.

758
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,616
Without her, you're just
a bunch of gay-looking kids

759
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,755
down an alleyway.

760
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,880
Have you kissed her yet?

761
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,194
- No way.
- Why not?

762
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,833
She's a year older than me.

763
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,176
And, anyway,
she's got a boyfriend.

764
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,668
- Ah. Who?
- Evan Adams.

765
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,233
He's, like, a full-grown man.

766
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,157
He's got a car and all
and stubble.

767
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,236
What's he doing
hanging out with a kid?

768
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,674
She's not really like a kid.

769
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,030
Hmm.

770
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,160
- What's this?
- Homework.

771
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,759
You're good. Get better.

772
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,677
How d'you know
he's her boyfriend anyway?

773
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,153
It seemed like it.

774
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,191
Pulled off in his car,
music blaring.

775
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,320
He's pretty cool.

776
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,714
What was he listening to?

777
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,068
Genesis.

778
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,349
He will not be a problem.

779
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,232
- Really?
- Trust me.

780
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,035
No woman can truly love a man
who listens to Phil Collins.

781
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,833
Shh.

782
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,393
Listen.

783
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,318
I think she's having an affair.

784
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,040
What? Why?

785
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,520
She gets a lift home from her
boss a couple of times a week.

786
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,358
She doesn't drive.
What's wrong with that?

787
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,816
She gets out of the car about
100 yards away from the house.

788
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,796
It's a nervous thing.

789
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,078
She's overcompensating.

790
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,513
Good night, then.

791
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,552
Hey, Conor, what's going on?

792
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,680
I don't know.

793
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,954
What are you doing?

794
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,951
Just, just rabbit stuff.

795
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,553
D'you want to write a new song?

796
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,750
Yes, I do.

797
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,074
Records.

798
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,952
Really good records.

799
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,398
My brother loves this.

800
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,988
He says it's homework.

801
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,513
You see how bass guitar

802
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,520
and the bass pedal
are playing the same rhythm?

803
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,953
You'll hear it now, wait.

804
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,832
I told all of yous,
you especially,

805
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,678
shitting on the bed
all the time.

806
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,279
You can't put rabbits
on the bed

807
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,000
and not expect them
to shit on your bed.

808
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,513
A chord like...

809
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,709
Yeah.

810
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,315
Somewhere in the...

811
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,998
♪ Da, da, da, da, da, miles ♪

812
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,554
♪ Miles below me ♪

Boys, look at David Bowie.

857
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,317
Oh, I like this.

858
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,555
- What is it?
- My band.

859
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,312
- You're in a band? Cool.
- Yeah.

860
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,440
What are they called?

861
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,192
Sing Street.

862
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,719
Who's this now?
Your girlfriend?

863
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,716
Yeah.

864
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,671
No.

865
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,438
She's a friend of mine.

866
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,232
- She's a model.
- Hmm.

867
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,753
But she's got a boyfriend.

868
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,995
An older guy.

869
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,872
Ah.

870
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,673
All the complicated boys
and girls.

871
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,276
Good work.

872
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,551
Brother Baxter would like
to see, uh, Conor Lawlor.

873
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,113
Okay. Conor.

874
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,199
Conor Lawlor.

875
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,320
What's going on?

876
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,628
With what?

877
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,875
This.

878
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,672
Oh, well.

879
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,432
I checked the rule book...

880
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,176
the-the one you mentioned
about brown shoes...

881
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,952
and I couldn't find anything
about makeup

882
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,274
or altering hair color.

883
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,356
Oh, and look.

884
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,109
I painted these
with paint from the art room.

885
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,468
Head down to the toilet

886
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,840
and remove the makeup
right now.

887
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,110
- Why?
- Because I told you to.

888
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,514
But I'm in a band.

889
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,153
It's a school band,

890
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,096
and I think it's important
that we have a look.

891
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,872
You're a man.
Men don't wear makeup.

892
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,399
But why not?

893
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,636
People in the 18th century
wore makeup.

894
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,557
That means people
like Mozart wore makeup,

895
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,715
and he was a man.

896
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,229
So you're Mozart now, are you?

897
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,470
That makes me Salieri, is it?

898
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,953
Who's Salieri?

899
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,389
You've a fine face.

900
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,671
Pretty enough without makeup.

901
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,631
Take it off.

902
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,069
You can use my bathroom,
if you like.

903
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,432
Come on in here.

904
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,631
I'm gonna go to class now.

905
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,669
Jesus!

906
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,555
You can't do this!

907
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,477
Do you want to bet?

908
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,158
I'll get you clean,
don't worry.

909
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,633
Clean you all up.

910
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,030
Get all that shite off you.

911
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,709
Take pride
in your God-given features.

912
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,158
No more Ziggy Stardust.

913
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,029
- Hey, Cosmo.
- Who?

914
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,720
Cosmo. That's what
I'm calling you now.

915
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,513
You're gonna need a catchy name
if you're gonna be in a band.

916
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,709
Right.

917
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,319
What happened?

918
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,714
Nothing.

919
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,114
Come on.

920
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,152
I really liked your song.

921
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,838
It made me cry.

922
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,836
Oh.

923
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,837
I'm really sorry.

924
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,514
No, that's a good thing.

925
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,436
So who's the guy with the car?

926
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,879
Evan?

927
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,433
Yeah.

928
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,199
Is he your boyfriend?

929
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,878
We're on and off.

930
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,831
It's complicated.

931
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,315
We're actually on
a little break at the moment.

932
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,078
Yeah.

933
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,872
Good idea.

934
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,797
Take a break for a year or so.

935
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,559
Get some perspective.

936
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,956
He's actually
a really nice guy.

937
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,593
Yeah.

938
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,995
Shit taste in music, though.

939
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,837
We're going to London soon.

940
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,474
I'm too young to go on my own,
so he's organized everything.

941
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:55,070
What's in it for Evan?

942
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,553
Are you jealous, Cosmo?

943
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,954
Why would I be jealous?

944
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,399
Exactly.

945
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,310
Will you write me
a happy song sometime?

946
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,714
I need a laugh.

947
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,193
But what if I don't feel happy?

948
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:13,110
Your problem is that you're
not happy being sad.

949
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,038
But that's what love is, Cosmo.

950
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,718
Happy-sad.

951
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,072
Shit, I've got to go soon.

952
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,789
We only have a half hour
dinner window in our house.

953
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,911
So, what's the house like,
where you live?

954
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,479
It's nice.

955
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,478
Nicer than some of the dumps
I've lived in.

956
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,717
So where are your parents?

957
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,949
My dad's brown bread.

958
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,355
He got hit by a car.

959
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,550
Oh, my God. Sorry.

960
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,676
Really don't be.

961
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,597
He was a drunk.
He deserved it.

962
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,598
And me ma's in and out
of hospital.

963
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,119
Why?

964
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,514
She's a nurse.

965
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,153
Oh, right.

966
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,589
No, she's manic-depressive.

967
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,156
So, like, happy-sad.

968
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,714
You're funny, I like that.

969
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,592
Well, let me know
if you need me

970
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,439
for any more videos
before I go.

971
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,634
When are you going?

972
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,392
Soon.

973
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,597
What did she mean by that?

974
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,312
Well, I think
what she means is that

975
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,198
you need to reach
a place in your life

976
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,833
where you're okay
with your sadness.

977
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,234
It's pretty high concept stuff.

978
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,640
How old d'you say
she was again?

979
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,760
Sixteen.

980
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,119
It's monastic.

981
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,280
She's like a monk.

982
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,470
She sounds really pretentious.

983
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,040
Why, 'cause she wants to leave
school and follow her vocation?

984
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,760
You call wanting
to be a model a vocation?

985
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,552
Anything can be
a vocation, Ann.

986
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,797
Being a taxi driver,
being a bin man, being a poet,

987
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,030
being a singer,
being an artist.

988
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,435
Brendan, I never wanted
to be an artist.

989
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,576
We couldn't get the brush
out of your hand

990
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,476
when you were a kid.

991
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,830
What is wrong
with being an architect?

992
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,188
It's not a vocation.

993
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,629
I thought
everything was a vocation.

994
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,478
Don't be playing
word games with me, Ann.

995
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,029
I don't do "words," all right?

996
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,355
Come on, Conor.

997
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,557
Turn out the lights
before you go to bed, Ann.

998
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,398
So her dad's dead
and her mam is a lunatic.

999
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,873
And you thought
you had problems.

1000
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,470
I see now what the older
boyfriend thing is about.

1001
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,477
Daddy issues.

1002
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,113
I used to know
chicks like this.

1003
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,390
They're tricky, and they need
a lot of protecting.

1004
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,748
Are you up to that, Conor?

1005
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:42,155
I don't know.

1006
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,191
So what's it all about?

1007
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,551
I think she's just
an amazing human being.

1008
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,797
I've never seen
anyone like her.

1009
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,275
The way she talks and looks.

1010
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,776
She wears these sunglasses,

1011
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,429
and when she takes them off,
her eyes

1012
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,280
are like the clouds
clearing past the moon.

1013
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,631
Sometimes I just
want to cry looking at her.

1014
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,113
They're happy-sad.

1015
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,997
So how do you mean
you're "happy-sad"?

1016
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,997
Yeah, how am I supposed
to market that?

1017
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,678
It means we're not pop anymore.

1018
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,119
We were pop?

1019
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,496
Listen,
I'm happy being anything.

1020
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,953
I just want to play music.

1021
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,080
That's fine.

1022
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,200
Be who you are, Eamon.

1023
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,958
Well, I don't know who I am.

1024
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,308
Maybe I'm happy-sad, too.

1025
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,833
I don't know.

1026
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,359
What does happy-sad even mean?

1027
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,357
How can we be both things?
It makes no sense.

1028
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,118
It means that I'm stuck
in this shithole

1029
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,874
full of morons and rapists
and bullies,

1030
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,797
and I'm gonna deal with it,
okay?

1031
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,150
It's just how life is.

1032
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,590
I'm gonna try and accept it
and get on with it

1033
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,950
and make some art.

1034
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,433
So how does that
affect our music?

1035
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,437
- Positively.
- All right.

1036
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,753
Okay.

1037
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,836
So the idea of this video
is about a guy

1038
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,188
standing halfway down a pier,

1039
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,912
and a beautiful woman
walks past him

1040
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,479
towards the lighthouse.

1041
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,956
Half an hour later,
she hasn't come back.

1042
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,719
So he investigates,
but she's gone.

1043
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:52,880
What?

1044
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,876
She killed herself.

1045
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,194
No, she's a mermaid,

1046
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,799
and she's jumped
back into the sea.

1047
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,600
You see, she got washed up
in a fishing net

1048
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,520
so she's been in the city,
and she's been dying

1049
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,830
to get back to the water,
to her friends.

1050
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,109
Back to where she belongs.

1051
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,832
That's much better.

1052
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,599
I know.

1053
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,553
Okay, so we're playing here
and Raphina walks by.

1054
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,591
- So where do I jump from?
- Here.

1055
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,234
- Aah!
- Yeah.

1056
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,873
How'd that look, lads?

1057
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,069
Yeah, it looked all right.

1058
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,355
It's a bit shit.

1059
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,833
That supposed to look like

1060
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,279
they're jumping in
or something?

1061
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,549
Yeah.

1062
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,033
It doesn't.

1063
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,079
Trust me. It'll work.

1081
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:39,556
Yeah, it was great!

00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,636
Ah! Fantastic!

1083
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,795
Can you really not swim?

1084
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,319
No.

1085
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,759
So why'd you do that, then?

1086
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,838
For our art, Cosmo.

1087
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,275
You can never
do anything by half.

1088
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,992
Do you understand that?

1089
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,957
I'm... I'm sorry.

1090
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,559
Look, I was...

1091
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,238
Great is what it was.

1092
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,396
Fair play.

1093
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:15,159
What about Evan?

1094
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,633
Yeah, you ruined it.

1095
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,956
You know, on a clear day,

1096
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,696
you can actually see
the mainland of Britain.

1097
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,553
Island's only 30 miles
from the coast of Wales.

1098
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,478
Bet you didn't know that.

1099
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,910
It has to have just rained,
no dust in the air.

1100
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:47,191
You can just about see it.

1101
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,639
No way.

1102
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,113
How do you know
stuff like that?

1103
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,629
My granddad worked
on the ships to Holyhead.

1104
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,955
He used to take me out here.

1105
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,834
We used to go out
in his little boat, fishing.

1106
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,030
Wow.

1107
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:04,118
So I can wave back to you
when I'm in London.

1108
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,437
My brother says
all the great artists

1109
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,915
had to get off this island.

1110
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,519
The ones who stayed
got depressed

1111
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,710
and turned into alcoholics.

1112
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,519
Makes sense.

1113
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,551
You talk about
your brother a lot.

1114
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:29,076
Do you really love him?

1115
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,191
He was gonna go to Germany
when he was younger.

1116
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,197
But my parents
would never let him go

1117
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,436
without finishing school.

1118
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,115
He was gonna run away;
he had the whole thing planned,

1119
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,355
so he says.

1120
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,595
So what happened?

1121
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,472
My mum found out.

1122
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,600
She closed it down.

1123
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,154
She didn't want him to go.

1124
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,794
Maybe she loved him too much.

1125
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,433
Yeah.

1126
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,118
Actually, I think you're right.

1127
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,835
That's what my dad
always used to say.

1128
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,309
When my ma would be
in hospital, in a spell,

1129
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,271
and it was just the two of us.

1130
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,440
So I'd get all dressed up
to go out with my friends,

1131
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,118
then he'd make me stay in.

1132
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,593
And afterwards, he'd say,

1133
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,876
"I love you too much,
is all."

1134
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,176
And the thing is, me ma's
much better-looking than I am,

1135
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,158
so I don't really know
why he'd bother with me.

1136
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,758
It's a strange
kind of love, isn't it?

1137
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,110
Parents.

1138
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,358
I would've saved her.

1139
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,072
And I could've.

1140
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,696
- No, you couldn't have.
- I could've.

1141
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,314
- You're too small.
- I'm not too small.

1142
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,560
You're way too small.

1143
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:42,868
I've a good joke
for you guys.

1144
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,434
Vagina. Do you get it?

1145
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,959
- No.
- Exactly.

1146
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,434
All right, uh...

1147
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,198
why did the pink...

1148
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,199
Look at her.

1149
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,476
She races home every evening

1150
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,670
just to catch that
last little bit of sun...

1151
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,475
...have a cigarette
and read her papers.

1152
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:19,070
She's always talking about
going on a holiday to Spain.

1153
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,749
But he never takes her.

1154
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,593
That's all she gets.

1155
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:29,110
Then that tall tree blocks it,
and she comes in.

1156
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,475
I often wonder
what she's thinking about.

1157
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,798
That's amazing.

1158
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,760
Ah, how's the band
getting along?

1159
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:18,920
What are they called again?

1160
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,149
"The Queers"?

1161
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,616
Good one, Barry.

1162
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,790
Is, uh, anyone
getting these down?

1163
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,478
You know who you're
a bit like, Barry?

1164
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,919
Uh, Oscar Wilde.

1165
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,336
What class is he in, then?

1166
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,316
He's not in school,
Barry, you spanner.

1167
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,920
You know I am gonna kill you
one of these days.

1168
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,913
No, you're not.

1169
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,355
- 'Cause you don't even exist.
- What?

1170
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,696
Maybe you're living
in my world;

1171
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,676
I'm not living in yours.

1172
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,950
You're just material
for my songs.

1173
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,310
Man, I'd be very careful about
what you say to me next.

1174
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,509
Floor him, Barry.

1175
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,240
I don't want to have
to batter you again.

1176
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,234
Go ahead, Barry.

1177
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,959
Go on.

1178
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,036
You only have the power
to stop things.

1179
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,752
But not to create.

1180
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,151
"End of term disco
at the school hall.

1181
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,952
DJ and lights." So?

1182
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,554
I say we ask if we can
play there. First gig.

1183
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,238
- We're not ready.
- We could be.

1184
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,510
We need a deadline,
something to prepare for.

1185
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,870
We have exams.
We need to prepare for them.

1186
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,120
Yeah, they're midterm exams.
They don't mean anything.

1187
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,913
Yeah, well, they do to my ma.
She wants me to go to college.

1188
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,349
Get qualifications and all.

1189
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:38,879
Will there be girls
at the disco?

1190
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,115
Yes.

1191
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,878
I say we do it.

1192
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,399
We have five songs.

1193
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:46,233
We'd need a half-hour set,
so three more.

1199
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,430
Come on, where are you going?

1200
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,913
It's half-9:00 at night.

1201
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,096
Why are you acting,
all of a sudden,

1202
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,296
- as if it matters?
- Come on,

1203
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,456
- this is bullshit.
- As if you care?

1204
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,496
You're gonna
go down the street.

1205
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:09,856
You're gonna be back
in ten minutes.

1206
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,656
- Not this time.
- That's what you always say.

1207
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,318
It is not what I always say!

1208
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,856
It's 9:00 at night!
It's dark!

1209
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,056
I've got somewhere to go to.

1210
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,400
You're not taking the car.

1211
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,896
I suppose Mr. What's-His-Name
will come around in his.

1212
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,776
- His name's Tony.
- Tony can come around with his.

1213
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,313
Look here,
what about this dress?

1214
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,616
This dress is lovely.
Do you want to take that one?

1215
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,516
Don't touch my things!

1216
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,896
You'd look pretty sexy
in that one.

1217
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,148
When was the last time

1218
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,616
you noticed anything I wore,
any way that I looked?

1219
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,696
That's a pretty
sexy one, isn't it?

1220
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,776
He'll love that one,
won't he?

1221
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,376
What about knickers?
Have you got knickers?

1222
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,496
You probably don't... you don't
need any knickers, do you?

1223
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,520
Just put them away!

1224
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,914
This is life, Conor.

1225
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,359
Drive it like you stole it.

1226
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,513
Come on!

1227
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,829
No!

1228
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,920
- Come on, get her up.
- Let's get her up!

1229
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,316
What do you think
you're doing?

1230
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,313
That's great!

1231
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,116
Try a bit of hi-hat, Larry.

1239
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,117
And begin.

1240
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,717
What does this even mean?

1241
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,070
Suck my balls.

1242
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,430
- Quiet!
- Night now.

1243
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,315
- Hey.
- Hi.

1244
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,795
Do you want to go
on an adventure?

1245
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,796
Oh. Okay.

1246
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,511
Do you see the pole there,
the yellow one?

1247
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,033
Yeah.

1248
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,116
That's where we're heading.

1249
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:13,276
If my parents found out
I took this out,

1250
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,549
they'd kill me.

1251
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,079
Have you taken it out before?

1252
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,349
Every few weeks.

1253
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,096
A boat's like
a musical instrument...

1254
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,838
it doesn't like it
if you don't use it.

1255
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,394
That's what
my granddad said, you know,

1256
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,670
so I like to
look after it for him.

1257
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,480
Look, there's the ferry
heading to England.

1258
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,358
Full of lrish people.

1259
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,316
Okay, so go.

1260
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,793
"You just can't stand the way

1261
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,400
that we walked out
from the wreckage."

1262
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,078
What wreckage?

1263
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,394
Maybe the wreckage of family.

1264
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:52,840
That's what I was
thinking about.

1265
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,075
Okay, next.

1266
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,909
"You just can't stand the way
that I turned my life around."

1267
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,554
That's about you.

1268
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,716
What do you mean?

1269
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:07,149
Well, I was thinking
about my parents

1270
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,350
and how I thought
I had problems.

1271
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,471
And the way you've turned
your life around.

1272
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,431
How have I turned
my life around?

1273
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:14,754
Well, look at you.

1274
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,154
You're going
to a new country.

1275
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,156
You've got a vocation.

1276
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,679
You look amazing.

1277
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,676
Stop.

1278
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,800
Stop what?

1279
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,353
Just get on with the song.

1280
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,072
What's the video
gonna be about?

1281
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,998
So... I think it's set
at a school prom,

1282
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,997
like in
an American high school.

1283
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,315
I've always wanted to go
to an American school.

1284
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,431
With girls and hair gel.

1285
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,160
Have you seen
"Back to the Future"?

1286
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,037
I see all the films.

1287
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:41,118
Imagine the band,
all in suits.

1288
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,470
I have all the shots
planned in my head.

1289
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,272
My brother told me
to think big.

1290
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,755
And what if I come
in a big '50s dress?

1291
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,313
Yeah.

1292
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,591
And the whole crowd parts
and everyone disappears.

1293
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:56,156
And then we all break out
into this big dance routine,

1294
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,236
and everyone is there.

1295
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:02,276
And then you and I
just run off into the night

1296
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,358
with the twinkling lights
of the city behind us.

1297
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,478
You were a bit attractive
back there.

1298
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,756
Back where?

1299
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,519
On the boat.

1300
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,119
Thank you.

1301
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,356
Just a little bit.

1302
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,909
Bit like a captain.

1303
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,349
I like that.

1304
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,675
Aye-aye.

1305
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,995
You're always very attractive.

1306
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,838
I know.

1307
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:32,995
And very conceited.

1308
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,513
Just stop talking.

1309
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,709
For once.

1310
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,515
I've just...

1311
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:05,669
Sorry.

1312
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,479
- Now, is it...?
- Oh, yeah.

1313
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,600
Yeah.

1314
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,916
So when are
we shooting this video?

1315
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,712
Saturday next.

1316
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,193
Oh.

1317
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,556
Conor?

1318
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:51,837
Good. You're up.

1319
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,197
If this is about
my exam results...

1320
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,719
I can explain, see...

1321
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,717
It's not about
your exams, Conor.

1322
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:03,229
We need to talk
to all of you. Sit down.

1323
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,593
Well, so, firstly,

1324
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,816
we don't want to make a big
deal about this, you know.

1325
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,096
It's something we've
thought about a lot.

1326
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,136
A lot of married couples...

1327
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,832
Your father and I
are splitting up.

1328
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:15,393
Thank you. That's great.

1329
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,238
It was just
a matter of time.

1330
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:18,634
I'll go get the bags packed.

1331
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,159
Let me know when
we're ready to go.

1332
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,080
Why don't you sit down,
Brendan, for a second?

1333
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,673
We'll tell you
what we're thinking.

1334
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,189
You see if you agree.

1335
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:29,198
A consensus?

1336
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,316
That's novel. Okay.

1337
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:36,753
Your mother has
fallen in love with Tony.

1338
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,348
They're gonna be moving into
his apartment for awhile and...

1339
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:40,480
Yeah.

1340
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,312
We've had an offer
on this house.

1341
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:45,113
It's half what it's worth,
but we're gonna take it.

1342
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,151
I can't afford
to live here on my own.

1343
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,635
So you're getting a divorce?

1344
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,200
Can't get divorced
in lreland,

1345
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:53,356
so we'll be
legally separated.

1346
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:54,800
I'm gonna be
getting an apartment,

1347
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,037
and you three will live
between there and...

1348
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,513
there.

1349
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,910
I'm not gonna be
staying at Tony's.

1350
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,793
Let's get that crystal clear.

1351
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:07,434
I'd rather sleep
on the street.

1352
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:11,599
I understand this is upsetting
for you, Brendan.

1353
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,438
You don't understand anything!

1354
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:15,994
For all of you.

1355
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,676
This is bullshit.

1356
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:22,593
So you were right.

1357
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,760
They're just
human beings. I told you that.

1358
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,233
I was sort of hoping
they'd come

1359
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,078
to my gig
at the end of the month.

1360
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,280
What, you thought they'd just
become different people

1361
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,590
and start noticing
what you were doing

1362
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,153
and what you wanted?

1363
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:35,680
They've got
their own shit going on.

1364
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,136
They're not going
to your stupid gig.

1365
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,513
So why is it stupid now?

1366
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,480
It's not that it's stupid,
it's just annoying.

1367
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:41,640
What's wrong with you?

1368
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:42,960
I don't know.
I'm in withdrawal!

1369
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,638
- From what?
- I haven't smoked hash

1370
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,557
- in two days, Conor.
- Why?

1371
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:48,591
So I can do something
with my life.

1372
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,312
Like what?

1373
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:02,632
Do you see that guitar?

1374
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,228
I used to be able
to play that guitar... well.

1375
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,032
I used to ride hot girls.

1376
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:10,232
I could run 200 meters faster
than anybody in my school.

1377
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,918
You're the youngest.

1378
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,952
You get to follow the path
that I macheted

1379
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:17,355
through the jungle
that is our mad family.

1380
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:20,040
I was alone with them
for six years.

1381
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,513
You think they're crazy now?

1382
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:22,816
Think about what they were like

1383
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,319
when they were
in their late 20s.

1384
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:27,193
Two Catholics in a rented flat
with a screaming baby,

1385
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:29,595
who just got married because
they wanted to have sex.

1386
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,836
They didn't even
love each other.

1387
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,235
I was in the middle
of that, alone.

1388
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,515
And then you came along.

1389
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:37,471
Thank God!

1390
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,556
And you followed...

1391
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,989
the path that I cut for us.

1392
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,957
Untouched.

1393
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:46,714
You just moved
in my jet stream.

1394
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:48,193
And people
laugh at me, Conor.

1395
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:51,392
The stoner,
the college dropout.

1396
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,192
And they praise you,
which is fine!

1397
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,117
But once...

1398
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,629
I was a fucking jet engine!

1399
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,351
Back in a second.

1400
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:33,277
Need to go to the bathroom.

1401
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,153
Ngig.

1402
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:01,753
Can you move
that mic stand over

1403
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,656
- a bit more, all right?
- Are you expecting her soon?

1404
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:04,908
I thought she was coming,

1405
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,598
but I don't know
where she is.

1406
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,136
Right, so you better
get something filmed.

1407
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,275
Yous have an hour.

1408
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:10,276
Come on, Conor.

1409
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,719
She's not coming.

1410
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:12,955
Let's just do whatever.

1411
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,832
Okay.

1412
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,638
Come over, guys.

1413
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,636
Okay, so this is like
a school video,

1414
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,392
except not like
an lrish school,

1415
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:25,080
more like an American school,
and it's prom night.

1416
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,031
Have you seen
"Back to the Future"?

1417
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:31,717
Okay, well, it's just kind of
like '50s dancing, and...

1418
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,273
Like what?

1419
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:36,278
It's... like dancing
from the '50s, you know,

1420
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,240
clicking fingers and...

1421
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:39,793
Can we try some now, actually?
Just...

1422
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,195
Yeah. Yeah.

1423
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:43,588
That's it. Yeah.

1424
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,200
Yeah, maybe do
a few twirls and stuff.

1425
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:46,548
Just do what's natural.

1426
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,238
Make it as natural as possible.

1427
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:49,918

Hi. Is Raphina there?

No.
She doesn't live here anymore.

What?

1497
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:04,952
Yeah, we all...

She's mad like that,
determined.

Where is she?

1502
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:16,674
She's gone to London
with her fella. Last night.

1503
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,759
Wow, um...

1504
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,836

No.

Raphina.

Raphina.

Oh, no, I'm Raphina's
younger sister.

1529
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:36,680
Sorry.

1530
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,837
No, you're not.

1531
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,349
What are you doing?
I thought you were in London.

1532
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,110
I mean, it was
a mad idea, anyway.

1533
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:58,549
Don't even know
anyone in London.

1534
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,875
I thought he had
booked tickets.

1535
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,228
No.

1536
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:05,557
No, that was just an act
to get a ride.

1537
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,233
He doesn't even have a flat

1538
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,112
or friends or any of that.

1539
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:12,592
So where is he now?

1540
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:14,597
I don't know.

1541
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:16,836
He left me
in a B and B in town.

1542
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,473
We had this big row.

1543
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,397
He said I wasn't
pretty enough to be a model,

1544
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:22,954
and that I was too small.

1545
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:25,674
Kinda true. I'm pretty short.

1546
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,837
What happened to your cheek?

1547
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,474
Did he hit you?

1548
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,556
Yeah, but I totally
deserved it.

1549
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,993
So what are you gonna do now?

1550
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,314
I don't know.

1551
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:46,913
I was gonna print some CVs,

1552
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,400
but I haven't
really done anything,

1553
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,835
except your videos.

1554
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:54,032
McDonald's have an ad
in their window.

1555
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:56,116
Would you still fancy me
if I did that?

1556
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:57,912
"D'you want chips with that?"

As long as you're happy.

1558
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,717
So that's my life now.

1559
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,557

Well...

1576
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,997
she was always going on
about London.

1577
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,678

1611
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,038
See you later.

1612
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:41,030
Cool, she's not here.

1613
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:45,936
Do you know
where the photocopier is?

1614
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:47,416
- Yeah.
- Photocopy 200 of these.

1615
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:48,555
Why?

1616
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:50,796
You'll see.

1617
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:52,194
Come on, Darren.

1618
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:55,392
We've got one more thing to do.

1619
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,193
Now leave this to me.

1620
01:21:58,320 --> 01:21:59,753
Yeah.

1621
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:03,872
Who's that, Barry?

1622
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,991
If it's the TV license man,
tell him to piss off.

1623
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:07,792
What do yous want?

1624
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,896
- We want to talk to you.
- Shut up, you stupid bitch!

1625
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:11,536
You know what, Barry,
you think you're different

1626
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:12,959
from us, and you are.

1627
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:14,513
You're bleedin' nuts.

1628
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:16,640
We all have one thing
in common... me, you and him.

1629
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:19,718
We're all shit at school.
We're bleedin' useless.

1630
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,398
- So?
- What are you gonna do

1631
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:22,840
when you get kicked out
of school?

1632
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,200
Stay at home
with your ma and da

1633
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:25,832
watching day-time telly,
getting wasted?

1634
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,228
Yeah, okay.

1635
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,237
Well, we're gonna be in a band.

1636
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:30,952
Gigging, on the road.

1637
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:33,469
Different venues each night,
different women.

1638
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,079
And d'you know what bands need?

1639
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,713
What do bands need?

1640
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:38,671
Roadies.

1641
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:39,949
Someone who is strong.

1642
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,513
Someone who can fight.

1643
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:43,496
Get in here, Barry,
and get us another beer!

1644
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:44,936
You worthless shite!

1645
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,518
I'm a worthless shite.

1646
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:48,995
I mean, what would you want
with me in a fag band?

1647
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:51,429
Being in a band
is like being in the army.

1648
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:54,028
Everyone has everyone's back.

1649
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:56,390
D'you think you're up for it?

1650
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:59,159
Get in here
and get us another can, Barry,

1651
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,296
or do you want another smack?!

1652
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,590
Where do you think
you're going?!

1653
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:07,278
Get back here,
you little prick!

1654
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,513
Okay, that was good,

1655
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:09,471
but now it's time
for some live music.

1656
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,916

Okay, here's one called
"To Find You."

1700
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:11,634
It's a slow song.

1701
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:16,509
Conor, we're not playing
a bleedin' slow song at a gig.

1702
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,471
- Are you mad?
- No?

1703
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,238
They love us. We'll blow it.

Eamon?

1705
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:23,675
I don't know, it's a bold move.

1706
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:27,071
Let's do it.

1707
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,116
Okay,

1708
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:33,879
this song's for anyone who
thought they had a girlfriend

1709
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,390
for a day, but then she just
turned out to be a friend.

1710

01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,079
Okay.

1737
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:45,475
So this is our last song,
so come back in.

1738
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,272
Don't worry, it's a fast one.

1739
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,296
It's about this school,
and it's for Brother Baxter.

1740
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:50,833
Lights!

1741
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:53,838
Oh, oh, yeah, right.

1742
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:01,679
Hey! Hey!

1743
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:03,836
Leave that light switch alone.

1744
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:05,176
Didn't you hear
what I told you?!

1745
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:06,394
Hey!

1746
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:15,598
You think that's funny?

1747
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,877
Don't you push it now,
d'you hear me?

1748
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,558
What? It's a tribute song.

1749
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:25,336
If you want to keep this band
going next term,

1750
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:26,236
you'd better be careful.

1751
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:27,588
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay.

1752
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:28,720
Go on, Conor!

1753
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:31,149
Are you ready?

1754
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:32,856
This could be all of ours
first and last gig, man.

1755
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:33,710
You ready to do it?

1756
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:35,791
Let's go.

1757
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:37,876
Okay, so this is our last song.

1758
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,752
This is called "Brown Shoes,"

1759
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:41,280
and it's for every
Christian Brother

1760
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:42,594

Thank you!

1796
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:34,316
We're Sing Street!

1797
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,056
That was
Sing Street from Dublin.

1798
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:42,355
Shh, keep it down.

1799
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,630
Come in.

1800
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,760
Hi.

1801
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:49,440
Hey.

1802
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:50,913
Where are the parents?

1803
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:52,718
They're asleep.
How was the gig?

1804
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:54,512
Great.

1805
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:55,709
Hi.

1806
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:57,159
This is Raphina?

1807
01:34:58,240 --> 01:34:59,275
We need your help.

1808
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:00,833
Can you drive us to Dalkey?

1809
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:02,279
What for?

1810
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,834
Well, granddad's little boat
is still moored there.

1811
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,269
We're gonna sail to England,
the two of us.

1812
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:09,960
We're all set. We just need
a lift to the harbor.

1813
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,229
Yeah, sure.

1814
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,713
When are you thinking of going?

1815
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:14,512
Now.

1816
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:16,870
Now?

1817
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,230
Do you know anybody in England?

1818
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,152
- No.
- Do you have any sterling?

1819
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,032
No.

1820
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:25,310
- No?
- No.

1821
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:27,953
She has her photographs.

1822
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:30,958
I've my demo tapes and videos.

1823
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:34,192
Let's go. Get the keys.

1824
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:21,196
I'll see you, Mum.

1825
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:22,912
I love you.

1826
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:29,760
All right.

1827
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:06,759
Okay.

1828
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:08,399
You call as soon as
you get there.

1829
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:10,317
- No messing, all right?
- I will.

1830
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:13,034
Okay.

1831
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:15,355
All right.

1832
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:18,472
Hey, uh, before you go, I...

1833
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:22,269
wrote down some song lyrics.

1834
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:23,833
- Really?
- Yeah, it's pretty

1835
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:25,234
stream of consciousness stuff,

1836
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:26,913
but it's about this kid
and a girl.

1837
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:28,189
In the future.

1838
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:30,351
- Put some music to it sometime.
- Okay.

1839
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:32,550
Wish I'd done this.

1840
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:35,428
You'll probably die.

1841
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:36,560
But anyway, go on.

1842
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:37,675
Go.

1843
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:41,038
You should come and visit us.

1844
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:42,639
You seem like a mad bastard.

1845
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:44,159
Okay.

1846
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:45,680
You look after
that brother of mine.

1847
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:46,920
He's gonna be lost without me.

1848
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,560
I will.

1849
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,473
Call you tonight.

1850
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:15,919
Right, go on. Go on.

1851
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:17,712
Away.

1852
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:19,239
All right, so we're gonna go

1853
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:20,616
around the island
and straight on.

1854
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:21,516
Straight to Wales.

1855
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:22,834
Okay. Straight on.

1856
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,035
Straight on.

1857
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:27,520
All right.

1858
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:29,039
Right.

1859
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:30,275
Forward ho.

1860
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:18,318
Yes! Yes!

1861
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:21,191
Whoo!

1862
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,908
You're gonna want
to sit down around now.

1863
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:01,159
Why?

1864
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:05,710
That's why.

1865
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:13,433
Oh, my God.

1866
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:14,675
You okay?

1867
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,597
Yeah.

1868
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:17,755
Are you okay?

1869
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:19,359
Yeah.

1870
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:20,629
Conor!

1871
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:24,280
Jesus!

1872
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:33,399
Oh, my God.
