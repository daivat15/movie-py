1
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:16,345
Quiet.

2
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,014
Open the door, open the door.

3
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,562
What?

4
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,272
What in the devil?

5
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,362
Can you please stand up
and take us to the cash drawer, ma'am?

6
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,619
- I will not.
- We ain't asking.

7
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,405
There's no money in the drawers yet.

8
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,665
It's in the safe and I ain't got the code.

9
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,496
Prove it.

10
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,081
Drawer!

11
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,836
Here.

12
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,338
Open the drawer.

13
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,374
- I need the keys.
- Keys.

14
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,224
Step back.

15
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,095
Shit. Damn it!

16
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,639
Y'all are new at this, I'm guessing.

17
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,275
- Where's the money?
- I told you, it's in the safe.

18
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,186
- Well, who has the code?
- Mr. Clauson.

19
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,448
He'll be here soon
and I suggest you fellers don't be.

20
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,234
All you're guilty of right now
is being stupid.

21
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,403
Just leave and that's all it'll be.

22
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,825
Tell me I'm stupid again.

23
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,922
What time does Mr. Clauson get here?
Ma'am, look at me.

24
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,004
What time does Mr. Clauson get here, huh?

25
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,713
8:30 every morning.

26
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:33,923
We're walking.

27
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,643
And sit.

28
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,770
Where do you think you're going?
Sit on the floor!

29
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,830
You're stupid.

30
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,129
This ain't about you, darling.

31
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,929
Elsie, you all right?

32
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,101
Good morning.

33
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,318
You didn't have to hit him.

34
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,244
- Slow down.
- I ain't speeding.

35
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,128
See, little brother,
not a worry in the world.

36
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,093
Planning this and doing it
is two different things.

37
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:58,136
Maybe we should get there ahead,
get up to Olney.

38
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,389
Early bird gets the worm.

39
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,106
- Slow down.
- I ain't speeding.

40
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,297
I found these coins in the barn.

41
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,678
Lord knows how long
they've been sitting there.

42
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:40,432
I've been living off an inmate's diet,
and had all these coins

43
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,309
sitting right underneath
a bunch of feed sacks.

44
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,724
- This one says 1953.
- 1953?

45
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,858
I wonder if any of these
is collector's items.

46
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,236
You could be sitting on a fortune here.

47
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,647
I hope so.

48
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,531
Good morning, folks. Open the drawer!

49
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,909
Open the motherfucking drawer!

50
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,661
Ones, fives, 10s, 20s,
no hundreds, no bundles.

51
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,118
- You boys robbing the bank?
- Shut up.

52
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,783
Put your hands on the counter.
On the counter.

53
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,872
- Yes, sir.
- That's it, come on.

54
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,163
That's crazy. Y'all ain't even Mexicans.

55
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,876
Uh-uh, uh-uh. No bundles.

56
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,541
Just loose cash.

57
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,880
Okay.

58
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,544
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

59
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,088
Hands on the counter where I can see them!

60
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:20,801
Yes, sir.

61
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,511
You got a gun on you, old man?

62
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,302
You're damn right I got a gun on me.

63
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,640
- Are you gonna get his gun?
- Yeah.

64
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,430
Keep up with the circumstances, okay?

65
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:31,476
- Yeah, I got it.
- So are y'all gonna steal my gun, too?

66
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,188
I have my own gun.

67
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,524
We ain't stealing from you.
We're stealing from the bank.

68
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,485
Much obliged.

69
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,072
Let's go!

70
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,828
Sorry about this, folks.

71
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,456
Dirty, rotten sons of bitches.

72
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,332
Fuck you, old man!

73
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,121
Go, run, go!

74
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,232
Put the gun on the counter?
You trying to get us killed?

75
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,437
I ain't stealing from some old man.

76
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,648
We're stealing from one place, that's it.

77
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,483
You're turning out to be
a poor-ass criminal.

78
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:18,898
Oh, fuck you.

79
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,151
Whoo!

80
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,821
See what the early bird gets?

81
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,995
Maybe we should hit that branch in Jayton?

82
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,586
No, we ain't. We hit those banks first thing
in the fucking morning, when they're empty.

83
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:35,543
- When they're empty, God damn it!
- All right.

84
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,378
It's the last time I care to be shot at.

85
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,469
We got to be smart.
We're a ways from being finished.

86
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,380
Shit, I can do this all week.

87
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,547
We're gonna.

88
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:49,352
We're like the Comanches,
little brother, raiding wherever we please

89
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:52,435
with the whole of Texas
hunting our shadow.

90
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,232
Lord of the Plains.

91
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,988
- Hands off.
- Fuck off!

92
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,207
You hear about these bank robberies?

93
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,300
Why are you always dressed like me?

94
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,473
This is our uniform.

95
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,225
We ain't got no uniform.

96
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,306
You can wear whatever
color shirt you choose.

97
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,062
You just keep choosing mine.

98
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,690
Ranger regs say white,
blue, or tan dress shirts.

99
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,977
Stands to reason every once in a while
we're gonna be dressed the same.

100
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,488
Well, you know what they say
about imitation, Alberto.

101
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,320
You wanna hear about these bank robberies,

102
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,451
or you'll just sit there
and let Alzheimer's run its course?

103
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,157
Where are they at?

104
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,742
Texas Midlands...

105
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,499
the branch in Archer City
and the branch in Olney.

106
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,035
FBI want an assist?

107
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,750
Midlands ain't got
any branches outside Texas.

108
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,540
Plus, they're just hitting the drawers
for a few thousand.

109
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,128
FBI don't want it.

110
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,973
You may get to have some fun before they
send you off to the rocking chair yet.

111
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,320
I need you sober.

112
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,955
Who the hell gets drunk off a beer?

113
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,163
Place looks like shit.

114
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,831
You got anything else you wanna say?

115
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:09,719
There's not a decent steak in the whole
lot of them sorry sons of bitches.

116
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,676
Yeah, well, while you were busy in jail,

117
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,383
I was busy looking after Mama,
so you can go fuck yourself.

118
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,270
Was she in that bed awhile?

119
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,321
Three months.

120
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,051
The end there was pretty rough.

121
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,890
I could've helped out
a little if she asked.

122
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,723
I could've fed them skinny cows.

123
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,603
We had nothing to feed them.

124
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,110
Well, I could've helped clean up
the house a bit.

125
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,858
Never took you for the go-to guy
for house cleaning.

126
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:16,153
No. Just robbing banks.

127
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,571
You know.

128
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,043
Fuck her.

129
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,304
She never wanted nothing
to do with me anyway.

130
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,765
She leave a will?

131
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:50,274
Yeah.

132
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,946
Am I in it?

133
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:00,826
The will don't matter.

134
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:06,078
She left everything to me.
By Friday it all goes to my boys.

135
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,341
She didn't mean nothing by it.

136
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,340
She damn sure meant it.

137
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,346
She always hated me
for standing up to him.

138
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,223
We all got punished.

139
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:23,137
You never understood that fighting back
makes the beating last longer.

140
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,305
No, I understood.

141
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,145
That's why I stopped fighting
and shot that son of a bitch.

142
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,793
Hey, what's going on?

143
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,586
Somebody robbed the bank this morning.

144
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:39,800
Do what?

145
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:43,345
If you see anyone looking
a little sideways, give me a call.

146
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,181
Sideways don't wanna meet me.

147
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,687
Find itself on the wrong end
of a short rope.

148
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,770
Oh, well, that would simplify things
for everyone but you.

149
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:55,153
Maybe, if you can find the tree.

150
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,033
God, I love West Texas.

151
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,622
- Ranger.
- Hi there.

152
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,658
Wasn't much of a robbery.

153
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,748
Got off with just under $7,000.

154
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,790
Took the drawer money,
20s and under, only loose bills.

155
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,503
- No ink pack?
- Nope.

156
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,339
- Smart.
- That was smart.

157
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,424
Can we get a look at the video?

158
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,590
Let me introduce you
to the bank manager, Mr. Clauson.

159
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,136
This here is Ranger Hamilton.

160
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,599
- Ranger.
- Sir.

161
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,515
Can we get a look
at the surveillance video?

162
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,902
We got cameras, but they're
switching us over to a digital system

163
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,312
that feeds into the computer.

164
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,152
These new cameras don't hook to our VCRs.

165
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,112
Call over the Young County Sheriffs.

166
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:46,613
Ask them if they thought to hook their
cameras to some sort of recording device.

167
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,079
- Armed?
- Yes, sir. Pistols.

168
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,368
Oh.

169
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,836
Faces covered?

170
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:57,875
Ski masks, sweatshirts, baggy pants...

171
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,587
- Uh-huh.
- Like them thugs in Dallas.

172
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,172
Tweakers, maybe?

173
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,427
Maybe.

174
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,431
A little early in the morning
for tweakers.

175
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,560
Tweakers don't sleep. They just tweak.

176
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:12,143
They rob drug stores
and parked cars, not banks.

177
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,522
Can I take a look inside?

178
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,898
Yes, sir.

179
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,559
Yeah, I'm here, Margaret.

180
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,694
So they bopped you in the snozzola, huh?

181
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,821
Yes, sir.

182
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,277
Not very nice.

183
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:28,200
I know their faces was covered,
but could you tell their race?

184
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,456
Black, white?

185
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,243
Their skin or their souls?

186
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,504
Let's leave their souls
out of this for now.

187
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,289
White.

188
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:41,676
From around here somewhere is my guess,

189
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,586
you know, from their voices.

190
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,005
Oh?

191
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,424
Young County says same deal
with the branch in Olney.

192
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,716
Excuse me.

193
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,932
Do they have video?

194
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,516
Same deal all the way around.

195
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:58,189
Doesn't Walmart sell all sorts
of electronic equipment?

196
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,319
My word. Get your hands off that.

197
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:06,447
Well, these boys, they aren't done yet,
I'll tell you that.

198
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,361
- How come?
- Well, they're patient.

199
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:12,249
They're just sticking to the drawers,
not taking the hundreds.

200
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,704
That's the bank's money.
We can trace that.

201
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,245
They're trying to raise a certain amount.

202
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,458
That's my guess.

203
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,545
It's gonna take a few banks to get there.

204
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,480
Your boys know how rich they're gonna be?

205
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,939
They don't know anything yet.

206
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,488
You take them to the funeral?

207
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,951
Like I said, they don't know anything.

208
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,331
When's the last time you saw them?

209
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,585
When we all went to the rodeo
in Stamford right after you got out.

210
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,962
- That was a year ago.
- I talk to them on the phone.

211
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,721
You talk to them on the phone?

212
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,927
- You want a little advice?
- No. No, I don't.

213
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,220
Go see them tomorrow.

214
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,981
You got any idea how much
I owe Debbie in child support?

215
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,863
You've got enough in your front pocket
to fix that problem right now.

216
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,901
We can't spare it, you know that.

217
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,112
Maybe we should hit another branch.

218
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,128
You know, you talk like
we ain't gonna get away with this.

219
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:45,087
I've never met nobody who got away
with anything, ever.

220
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,501
You?

221
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,381
Then why in the hell
did you agree to do it?

222
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,510
Because you asked, little brother.

223
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,194
I got to shit like an old goat.

224
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,231
Grab the check, meet me out front.

225
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,707
Well, if that isn't a hint,
I don't know what is.

226
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,878
- You like your steak?
- Yes, ma'am.

227
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,963
Well, you've got a ways to go yet.

228
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,468
Yeah, you'll be waiting around all day
for me to finish this.

229
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,180
I'll be here whether
you finish it or not, so...

230
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,719
you take your time.

231
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,565
Sure is quiet in here.

232
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:51,399
Open the drawer. Fives, 10s, 20s.

233
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,283
Fan them out like a deck of cards.

234
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,287
What do you do?

235
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,703
Last job was for a...

236
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,746
natural gas company.

237
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,298
Sounds high-dollar.

238
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,553
No, there ain't nothing
high-dollar about drilling.

239
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,840
No one seems to be
drilling for gas now, anyway.

240
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,383
They're sure drilling for oil.

241
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,598
I mean, ain't one drill
the same as the next?

242
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,598
That's my take on it.

243
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,442
Guess I got to get
someone else to believe me.

244
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,477
Son of a bitch!

245
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,859
We could use a cook.

246
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,491
Just a thought.

247
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,620
Order's up, Jenny Ann.

248
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:48,502
Bye.

249
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:11,813
Start the car!

250
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,151
Shit!

251
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,446
Fuck! Shit!

252
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,910
Go, go, go!

253
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,889
I bet you don't owe this much
in child support.

254
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:44,804
I must be out of my goddamn mind
to ask you for help.

255
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,566
You wanna get us killed? Huh?

256
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,604
That's not a Midlands Branch.
That's not part of the plan.

257
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,613
Now, we got to go back
to the ranch and bury the car.

258
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:55,944
- Fuck!
- No, we do not.

259
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,449
We're over halfway to Oklahoma.

260
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:01,704
I'm not driving a stolen getaway car
to a fucking Indian casino.

261
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,239
You just put us a goddamn day behind.

262
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:06,329
Well, I got us a day ahead
this morning, so I guess we're even.

263
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,119
- You're welcome.
- Fuck you.

264
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,513
Can't you answer your own phone?

265
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,801
I'm driving. You're just sitting there
twiddling your fat fingers.

266
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,061
Ranger Hamilton's phone.

267
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,898
It's reckless is what it is.

268
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,148
It's tweakers, I'm telling you.

269
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:13,981
I don't think these boys is reckless.

270
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,237
Damn sure ain't tweakers.

271
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,397
They know exactly what they're doing.

272
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,410
I don't know how you're gonna survive
without somebody to outsmart.

273
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,826
You need a hobby, and quick.

274
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,037
How about a horse?

275
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,545
Mary Beth was the rider.

276
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,206
A horse would only remind me of her.

277
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:39,506
You like to fish.

278
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:44,223
Not enough to do it every goddamn day.

279
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,476
Yeah, when I retire,

280
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:50,684
I'm gonna move Esme and me
down to Galveston.

281
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,143
Buy a fishing boat.

282
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:54,980
Gonna live on that son of a bitch
right at the pier.

283
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,861
Oh, who knows?

284
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,490
Maybe one of these bank robbers
is gonna want a gunfight

285
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:05,495
and I can dodge my retirement
in a blaze of glory.

286
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,530
Well, I've seen you shoot.

287
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,289
There won't be much glory in it.

288
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,243
Oh, well, I'm lucky

289
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,414
I got a half-breed by my side
to avenge me.

290
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,300
If you can stay sober long enough,

291
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,212
knowing how you Injuns like the bottle.

292
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,225
Whoa.

293
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,360
Hey!

294
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:44,525
What you all doing?
You burning this field?

295
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,114
Why in the shit would we do that?

296
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,870
This kicked up on the highway,
been chasing us ever since.

297
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,157
Wish we could do something for you.

298
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,371
Ought to just let it turn me to ashes,
put me out of my misery.

299
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,332
Cut that fence.

300
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:59,089
21st century, I'm racing a fire
to the river with a herd of cattle.

301
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,967
And I wonder why my kids
won't do this shit for a living.

302
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:04,094
Move 'em out. Come on.

303
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,630
Go, go, go.

304
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,600
You wanna call it in?

305
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,433
Oh, it's gonna burn out
when it hits the Brazos.

306
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:17,646
No one to call around here, anyway.

307
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:19,936
No, these boys is on their own.

308
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,453
I still don't see the problem, Toby.

309
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,613
You still don't...

310
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,791
Rhe problem is, thanks to you, we have to
spend tomorrow morning getting another car,

311
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,748
so we'll have to hit two banks
on Wednesday.

312
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,878
We already done three today.

313
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,585
Stop worrying.

314
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:44,835
Whose land is this?

315
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:48,764
Jeremy Chalker.

316
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,763
He lets me stay here in exchange
for shooting coyotes.

317
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,517
Cold beer in the fridge.

318
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,748
You stole my hat.

319
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,128
I borrowed it.

320
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,630
What the fuck you do to it?

321
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,809
- What's this?
- My livelihood.

322
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,815
We don't need all this.

323
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,602
Can't keep the guns
in the trailer days on end.

324
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,191
That's not coming with us in the bank.

325
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:50,655
Just spoke to the teller.

326
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:51,990
She's a little shook up.

327
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,285
Perp took her driver's license,
threatened her family if she talked to us.

328
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:00,335
Mind if I ask you your name, young lady?

329
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:02,246
Natalie Martinez.

330
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,835
Well, Natalie, I want you to know

331
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,968
we're gonna have some officers
watching your house extra careful

332
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,379
till we catch these buggers.

333
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,718
You have my word on that.

334
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,223
There's more than one?

335
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,427
Only one man robbed the bank?

336
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,391
- Yeah.
- What'd he look like?

337
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:22,809
He was dressed like a cowpoke
except for the ski mask.

338
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:27,947
I think he ran to a car
that was parked out front of the diner.

339
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,948
You saw the car?

340
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:32,075
It was green.

341
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,737
- How old?
- I don't know cars, mister.

342
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:38,624
Well, was it a nice car, an okay car,

343
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,079
or a real piece of shit?

344
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,957
It was a real piece of shit.

345
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,418
All right. Now, we're getting somewhere.

346
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,669
Oh, that looks like a man
who could foreclose on a house.

347
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,257
Excuse me, Natalie.

348
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,013
Excuse me, Mr. Banker.

349
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,721
Natalie, I'm gonna have the officer
stay with you till your father arrives.

350
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:57,009
- All right?
- Okay.

351
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,895
Didn't happen to have your surveillance
cameras on this morning, did you?

352
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,145
Of course.

353
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,228
Oh, so you have the robbery on video.

354
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,437
Of course we do.

355
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,319
What kind of bank would we be
if we didn't have video surveillance?

356
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:10,572
Oh, you'd be a Texas Midlands Bank.

357
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:12,529
All right, we've got video.

358
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,820
Care to give it a watch
while I wander over to the burger joint?

359
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,363
Would you order me something
while you're there?

360
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,408
- I'm starving.
- I doubt they serve pemmican.

361
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,497
You know I'm part Mexican, too.

362
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:26,956
Yeah, well, I'm gonna get to that
when I'm through with the Indian insults,

363
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,624
but it's gonna be a while.

364
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,216
You rangers are an odd bunch.

365
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,257
No, just him.

366
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,675
Let's take a look at that video.

367
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,639
Yeah, it's right back here.

368
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,363
Howdy.

369
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,738
Ma'am.

370
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,447
Guess you know about
the goings-on at the bank.

371
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:56,701
I did notice.

372
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,113
Any out-of-towners come through today?

373
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:03,538
Jenny Ann waited on a couple of boys,
ain't from here.

374
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,747
Oh?

375
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,503
I'll go get her.

376
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,005
Appreciate that.

377
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,752
Boys.

378
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,842
Y'all been here for a while?

379
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,927
Well, long enough to watch
a bank getting robbed

380
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,139
that's been robbing me for 30 years.

381
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,723
Oh, you say you've seen them?

382
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:28,021
I'm pretty sure they were sitting
right over there having lunch.

383
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,856
One of them was tall.

384
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,487
The other one was short.

385
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,234
They's both lean like cowboys.

386
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,903
Looked like brothers if you ask me.

387
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,992
You the Texas Ranger?

388
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,031
Yes, ma'am.

389
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:46,577
Tell me about those handsome
young strangers that you waited on.

390
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,921
Who said handsome?

391
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,252
I did.

392
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,926
Based on the fact that you didn't
meet me in the parking lot,

393
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:59,051
hollering about the two out-of-towners
eating here right before a bank robbery.

394
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,635
Well, they didn't mention
they was robbing the bank.

395
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,019
They paid cash?

396
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:07,606
That a crime now?

397
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,193
How much did they leave?

398
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:16,819
How much?

399
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,576
$200.

400
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:23,456
And they left it before
the bank was robbed, so...

401
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,036
Uh, before this bank was robbed.

402
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,332
I'm gonna need to see them bills.

403
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,375
- Ma'am.
- Mm-mm.

404
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,262
Ma'am, them bills is evidence.

405
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,799
Mm-mm, it's evidence
if they're the bank robbers.

406
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,889
Till then, it's my tip.

407
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:47,100
And half my mortgage.

408
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,931
So, you go out there and you get
a warrant, and you come after the money

409
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,977
that I will be using to keep a roof
over my daughter's head.

410
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,572
One man hit the bank, just like she said.

411
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,327
- Yeah.
- Checkered button-down shirt,

412
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:03,863
jeans, ski mask.

413
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,246
- That's all the video will tell us.
- Yep. Yep.

414
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:08,284
Checkered shirt. That is him.

415
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:12,205
They were sitting right over there.
Tipped her $200.

416
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,629
Go wrestle a description

417
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:19,170
from that big sassy girl in the kitchen.

418
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:20,428
You didn't get it yourself?

419
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:24,182
Oh, and get that tip from her.
We're gonna check them bills.

420
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:25,558
Good luck.

421
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,516
Yeah, I'd expect some resistance.

422
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,851
Oh, and, Alberto,

423
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:35,394
call that motel on 287, get us a room.

424
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,607
We're gonna stay the night?

425
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,317
Well, this is where the action is.

426
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,575
Seems foolish.

427
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,155
What's that?

428
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:46,822
The days of robbing banks
and trying to live to spend the money...

429
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,659
they're long gone.

430
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,206
Long gone for sure.

431
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,842
What does Justin want to do
when he's grown?

432
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,976
Right now he's dreaming
of slinging a football for A&M.

433
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,892
He's a lot like you.

434
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:18,562
- I bet that puckers your red eye.
- More than you know.

435
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:24,238
39 years of life, 10 in jail.

436
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:27,450
If he turn left where I turned right,
he'll be okay.

437
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:38,006
Let the world call me a fool

438
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:42,716
Things are right with me and you

439
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:45,464
Yaw.

440
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,514
Yaw.

441
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:05,783
You want anything?

442
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,615
Dr Pepper, Winston Lights.

443
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,868
It's okay. Come on.

444
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,013
What?

445
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,221
What, bitch?

446
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:35,063
You looking for trouble, motherfucker?

447
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:37,145
You came to the right place.

448
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:40,186
Boy, you'd think there were 10 of me.

449
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,608
Oh, yeah?

450
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:48,281
Not so fucking tough now, are you, bitch?

451
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,417
Hey, man, he had it coming.

452
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,086
He had it coming. He had it coming.

453
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:15,096
You got some spunk left in you.

454
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,641
Oh, you remembered the gun.

455
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:21,276
You're getting to be old hat at this.

456
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,487
Asshole could've killed you.

457
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:35,157
Ah, not the way
it would have gone, little brother.

458
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,043
10 of me, I told you!

459
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,004
Are you trying to make me mad?

460
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,089
I said Dr Pepper. This is Mr. Pibb.

461
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,253
That's all they had.

462
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,343
Only assholes drink Mr. Pibb.

463
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,677
Drink up.

464
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:03,981
Hello.

465
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,710
No!

466
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,332
Now we're talking.

467
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,094
The women in this place.

468
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,679
What the hell you talking about?

469
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,764
We should get another shot.
They'll be pretty soon enough.

470
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,395
Bartender, whiskeys if you please.

471
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,680
Coming up.

472
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,273
To your boys.

473
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:59,033
Let's go change that money.

474
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,257
Sorry. I just sold my car.

475
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,667
This is how the fella paid me.

476
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,551
We take it any way you bring it, mister.

477
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,433
Wanna play some poker?

478
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,601
I don't gamble.

479
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,520
You can't lose at poker, not even you.

480
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,941
I'm gonna watch the Aggie game
and have a beer.

481
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,450
All right, suit yourself.

482
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,487
Come on, now.

483
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,200
Suck a D.

484
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,706
Don't lose it all.

485
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,787
Eat my A!

486
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,668
Fucking asshole.

487
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:43,474
That's, uh... that's quite a stack.

488
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:54,985
Check?

489
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,491
Don't chase me, chief.

490
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:10,914
You Comanche?

491
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,552
Lords of the Plains.

492
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,138
Lords of Nothing now.

493
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:29,398
I call.

494
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,398
Show your cards, gentlemen.

495
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,414
Do you know what Comanche means?

496
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,540
It means enemies forever.

497
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,333
Enemies with who?

498
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,377
Everyone.

499
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,296
You know what that makes me?

500
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,463
An enemy.

501
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,507
No.

502
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,768
It makes me a Comanche.

503
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:15,771
Does he look like you?

504
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:17,988
I see his mom in him.

505
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,783
Everybody else sees me.

506
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,282
I don't know.

507
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,122
You staying in the hotel?

508
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:35,294
Yeah.

509
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,883
Take me to your room.

510
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:47,185
Thank you. Just, uh...

511
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:51,856
There's no shame
in needing the touch of a woman.

512
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:56,398
You need it.

513
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,821
I know you do.

514
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,700
Just let me touch you.

515
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:05,695
Trying to work my little brother?

516
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:07,660
- No, I wasn't doing anything, but I...
- Tanner, she didn't do nothin'.

517
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,540
- She didn't do nothin'.
- But, but, but...

518
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,497
You saw there was a stack of chips here.

519
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,706
- Don't.
- Easy mark?

520
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:14,746
- Uh... no.
- What were you gonna do?

521
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,881
Bring him up to his room, call your pimp,

522
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,087
- roll him, drug him, what?
- No. I...

523
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,751
- What were you gonna do?
- Tanner, no.

524
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,761
Mind if I sample the goods?
Real fuckin'...

525
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,925
Hands off. Stop it. Stop it.

526
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,352
- You're fucking crazy!
- Call me.

527
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,515
We got a problem here?

528
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,309
- It's all good.
- It's all good.

529
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,604
It's all good.
Just got a little drunk at the bar.

530
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:39,942
Sorry about that.

531
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:46,369
How the fuck have you managed
to stay out of prison for a year?

532
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,779
It's been difficult.

533
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,787
Like to pay this out in cash or check?

534
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,421
Get some Debbie money.

535
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,129
Four in cash, rest in check.

536
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,261
Who would you like the check made out to?

537
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:06,840
Texas Midlands Bank.

538
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,565
Thank you much.

539
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,311
Let's go get a room.

540
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,162
Welcome to the Comanche 66.
Do you have a reservation?

541
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,917
We do not.

542
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:38,455
Good Lord, look at you.

543
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,958
We would be obliged if you
would provide accommodations,

544
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,219
though we failed to call ahead.

545
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:46,379
Boy, you are trouble.

546
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:47,718
I'm the worst kind, darling.

547
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:52,761
In your last days in the nursing home,
you'll think of me and giggle.

548
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,564
Why, God? Why won't you answer my prayers?

549
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:02,195
You begged him for help,

550
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,776
and yet you look around at your life
and nothing is different.

551
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,193
And so you assume
that God has told you no.

552
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:12,163
God doesn't say no.

553
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,540
Why couldn't we drive back to Lubbock?

554
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,872
'Cause they ain't robbing banks
in Lubbock.

555
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,712
We're not gonna watch this, are we?

556
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:23,583
Ain't you Christian?

557
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,297
Yeah, but I ain't stupid.

558
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,509
God doesn't talk through this man
any more than he talks through my dog.

559
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,390
Well, then maybe you should
give your dog a listen.

560
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,641
Ain't you Indian?

561
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,802
You're supposed to be burning sage

562
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:39,440
and dancing around the bed,
whooping like a bee stung you.

563
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,567
I'm Catholic.

564
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:44,687
Come on.

565
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:50,322
Come on, I'd rather dance
around the fire with a spear.

566
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:53,329
I'd rather have you stab me
with a spear than watch this.

567
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,490
This son of a bitch, he wouldn't know God

568
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,626
if he crawled up his pant leg
and bit him on the pecker.

569
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:00,128
Change the damn channel.

570
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:10,839
Now, this, this is
what God watches right here.

571
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:17,896
Don't worry, they're gonna have
soccer highlights on soon enough.

572
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:19,727
That's for your Mexican half.

573
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:27,401
Wow, look at this boy run.

574
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,525
Longhorns are gonna have
a good team this year.

575
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:37,950
That soccer, never could understand that.

576
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:41,336
Anything a 5-year-old can do
ain't a sport.

577
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:44,919
Who invented it? Aztecs?

578
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:47,379
Kickin' around skulls or something, right?

579
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,004
Sounds like a Comanche sport.

580
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:54,257
You know, in three weeks,

581
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:57,677
you can watch whatever
you want on TV all day.

582
00:43:57,844 --> 00:44:00,267
Hell, you can do it right now
in your own room.

583
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,523
Oh, where's the fun in that?

584
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,518
You know what, Alberto?

585
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:07,691
What?

586
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:14,452
In a year's time,
it's my teasing that you're gonna miss.

587
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:17,451
It's what you'll laugh about

588
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:20,617
when you stand over my grave
and wish me well.

589
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,535
God, I hope that's tomorrow.

590
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:24,955
Oh, that was a good one.

591
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,134
You'll get the hang of this yet.

592
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:37,926
Isn't it getting late for you?

593
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:43,931
Yeah.

594
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,150
Yeah, it is.

595
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:08,331
Oh, heavens above.

596
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:10,670
Heavens above.

597
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,835
Look at those titties.
Are you fucking kidding me?

598
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,219
What are you doing?

599
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:05,601
Sleeping on the porch,
practicing my future.

600
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,613
It's a dangerous thing we do for a living.

601
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,315
You're lucky...

602
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,906
having seen it through to the end.

603
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:22,455
I hope I'm that lucky.

604
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,159
Oh, well.

605
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:30,163
Without me by your side,
I doubt you'll get close enough

606
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,878
to a criminal to ever be in danger again.

607
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,923
Just when I was starting
to feel sorry for you.

608
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:44,761
Indians ain't supposed
to feel sorry for cowboys.

609
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,554
It's the other way around.

610
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:56,864
And this makes you the executor?

611
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,570
Mm-hmm.

612
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:01,486
So, no matter what they charge us with,
they can't take it away?

613
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,201
There's no way to trace funds
from a casino, all right?

614
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:07,742
Once you get the checks to the bank,
trust is untouchable.

615
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:11,629
You can't tell nobody nothing, right?

616
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,004
Well, what is there to tell?

617
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:16,043
I mean, you boys won
that money gambling, didn't you?

618
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,718
$32,000 pays off the reverse mortgage.

619
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:25,351
And those bastards paid
the property tax from 2012 to now.

620
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,557
That's another $11,000.

621
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,690
So, $43,000 and you are free and clear.

622
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:35,487
Just have the loan officer
fax me a release of lien,

623
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,193
and I'll get that over
to the lease manager at Chevron.

624
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:40,358
- The fax number is on the card.
- Okay.

625
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,197
How much you making on this deal?

626
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:45,742
Not near as much as I'm risking.

627
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:47,031
Why you doin' it, then?

628
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:55,256
You know, they loaned
the least they could.

629
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:58,588
Just enough to keep your mama poor
on a guaranteed return.

630
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:03,339
Thought they could swipe
her land for $25,000.

631
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:07,010
That's just so arrogant,
it makes my teeth hurt.

632
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:11,393
To see you boys...

633
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,859
pay those bastards back
with their own money?

634
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:19,818
Well, if that ain't Texan,
I don't know what is.

635
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,449
Thank you.

636
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,489
Now, they can foreclose on Friday.

637
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:31,454
Come hell or high water,
be at the bank in Childress on Thursday.

638
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,039
Knowing them fuckers,
they will close early.

639
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:35,796
- We'll be there.
- Oh, and, Toby.

640
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:38,083
The trust needs to be managed by a bank.

641
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,251
You really wanna cover your tracks?

642
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,963
You get Texas Midland
to handle this trust.

643
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:06,118
So, what's the plan?

644
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:09,531
We're gonna watch that bank
like a deer feeder.

645
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:11,950
In time, we'll be right.

646
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:14,665
Now, let's see what they got to eat here.

647
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:18,084
Howdy, ma'am. How you doing today?

648
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:21,000
Hot, and I don't mean the good kind.

649
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:24,003
So, what don't you want?

650
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,797
Pardon?

651
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,556
What don't you want?

652
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:32,516
Oh, well, uh, I think I'll just, uh...

653
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:35,807
You know, I've been working here
for 44 years.

654
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:40,853
Ain't nobody ever ordered nothing
but T-bone steak and a baked potato.

655
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,523
Except this one asshole from New York

656
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:46,784
tried to order trout back in 1987.

657
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,365
We don't sell no goddamned trout.

658
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:52,865
T-bone steaks.

659
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:56,878
So, either you don't want
the corn on the cob,

660
00:49:57,036 --> 00:49:59,414
or you don't want the green beans.

661
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,048
So, what don't you want?

662
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:06,713
I don't want green beans.

663
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:08,677
I don't want green beans either.

664
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,933
Steaks cooked medium rare.

665
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:14,391
- Can I get my steak cooked...
- That weren't no question.

666
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:15,600
All right.

667
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:18,645
Iced tea for you boys.

668
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,059
Iced tea would be great.

669
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,320
Iced tea, yep. Thank you, ma'am.

670
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:24,696
Uh-huh.

671
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:29,986
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

672
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:33,205
Nobody's gonna rob this son of a bitch.

673
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:35,957
My word.

674
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:45,751
How's she feel?

675
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:48,592
She runs good.

676
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,848
Ain't gonna win any races.

677
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,553
Got New Mexico plates.

678
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:55,470
She got a top?

679
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:56,762
How she came.

680
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:00,354
We'll take her.

681
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,653
Don't report it stolen till Friday.

682
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,825
The guy from Chevron
is dropping off the lease agreement.

683
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,865
Are you okay dealing with that
by yourself?

684
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,658
You okay being with Debbie by yourself?

685
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:19,910
Remember, he ain't the enemy.

686
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,796
Just take the papers, say thank you.

687
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:25,959
The oil man is the enemy, make no mistake.

688
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:27,377
He just ain't ours.

689
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:30,880
I'll be back to the ranch by dark.

690
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:32,047
I will be waiting.

691
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:34,433
Drive like a schoolteacher
with all this shit in the back.

692
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:40,731
Sure feels like beer o'clock.

693
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:44,986
Ask and you shall receive.

694
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:15,345
Come in.

695
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,736
Mama died.

696
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:29,568
When?

697
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:30,902
A few weeks ago.

698
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:33,863
Well, good riddance.

699
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:36,320
No offense.

700
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:39,953
You okay?

701
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:42,751
You?

702
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:47,922
Here's the money I owe you.

703
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:53,303
I guess you'll be selling the ranch.

704
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,548
It goes to the boys.

705
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:56,715
- Really?
- Mmm.

706
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,384
It's been put in a trust.

707
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,722
What's that mean?

708
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,182
It means no one can sell it.

709
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:04,098
Great.

710
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,358
Something else I got to take care of.

711
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:20,447
Hi.

712
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,194
Where's your brother?

713
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,330
I don't know.

714
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:04,750
Friend's house, I guess.

715
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:12,591
How come you ain't in school?

716
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,510
School don't start yet.

717
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:18,388
Just two-a-days for football right now.

718
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:26,097
Your grandmother died.

719
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:30,772
I'm giving the ranch
to you and your brother.

720
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,651
Remember going out there
when you was little?

721
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:38,617
What am I supposed to do with a ranch?

722
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,282
Anything but sell it.

723
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,324
We found oil on it.

724
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:50,629
You and your brother ain't gonna
have to worry about money no more.

725
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:54,374
Now...

726
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:58,842
you may be hearing
a lot of things about me and...

727
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,089
your uncle.

728
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,469
Don't be like us.

729
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:06,762
You hear me?

730
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,649
Whatever I hear, I won't believe.

731
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:12,025
No, you believe it.

732
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:14,771
I did all of it.

733
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,066
Now, you, you do it different.

734
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:31,036
Ain't gonna drink it?

735
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:37,634
You tell me not to be like you,
and then you offer me a beer.

736
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:38,885
Which is it?

737
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:43,014
Good boy.

738
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:06,288
- How are the boys?
- What are you doin'?

739
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:07,572
Insurance.

740
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:10,372
I don't want that shit in the car.

741
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:13,378
We'll be running two cars
next time, brother.

742
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:14,663
They'll ride with me.

743
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,759
So, this is your plan?

744
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:26,804
We're just gonna sit here and see
if this is the branch they rob next.

745
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:28,093
What would you rather do?

746
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,933
You wanna drive 80 miles back to Olney

747
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:32,814
and look for more fingerprints
that we ain't gonna find?

748
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:35,726
Or you wanna drive 200 miles
back to Lubbock

749
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:38,021
and look at mugshots that don't matter
'cause nobody knows

750
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,733
what these sons of bitches look like?

751
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:42,491
Or we can just wait here
for them to rob this bank,

752
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:45,368
which is the one thing I'm pretty
damn sure they are going to do.

753
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:46,699
I know what you're doing.

754
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,115
You're trying to make this last
as long as you can

755
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:53,210
because the longer it lasts,
the farther you are from that front porch.

756
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:55,871
No, I'm waitin' for these boys
to make a mistake.

757
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:57,665
So far they ain't, but they will.

758
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,083
And they're gonna make it here.

759
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:01,919
So, just relax.

760
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,758
Enjoy this little town.

761
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:06,174
Do you wanna live here?

762
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:10,307
Got an old hardware store that
charges twice what Home Depot does,

763
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:14,394
one restaurant with
a rattlesnake for a waitress.

764
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:17,400
I mean, how is anybody
supposed to make a living here?

765
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:20,233
People have made a living here
for 150 years.

766
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:23,069
Well, people lived in caves
for 150,000 years,

767
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:24,483
but they don't do it no more.

768
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:27,324
Well, maybe your people did.

769
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:29,079
Your people did, too.

770
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:33,580
A long time ago,
your ancestors was the Indians...

771
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,496
till someone came along and killed them,

772
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:40,758
broke 'em down, made you into one of them.

773
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:47,097
150 years ago, all this
was my ancestors' land.

774
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:50,301
Everything you can see.

775
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,394
Everything you saw yesterday.

776
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:57,145
Till the grandparents
of these folks took it.

777
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:01,316
And now, it's been taken from them.

778
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:04,648
Except it ain't no army doing it.

779
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:08,111
It's those sons of bitches right there.

780
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:19,667
You thinking about tomorrow?

781
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:23,296
Ain't you?

782
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:26,045
The little hotel clerk.

783
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,598
Why is it always the sweet ones

784
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:32,430
that are such devils
when you get them revved up?

785
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:36,142
Wouldn't know. Never had a sweet one.

786
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:40,976
Yeah, you like them pissed off,
lookin' for someone to blame.

787
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,271
Sure seems that way.

788
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,160
It's a good thing you're doing.

789
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,497
We're doing it.

790
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,772
Go easy on the bank teller tomorrow.

791
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:23,564
I'll be as gentle as a young nurse.

792
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,088
You coming?

793
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,427
On my way.

794
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:16,719
Hey.

795
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:18,846
Shit.

796
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:24,146
Morning.

797
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:27,688
You want some breakfast?

798
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:29,603
Yeah, breakfast sounds good.

799
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:37,369
So we hit the Jayton branch first,
then Coleman, right?

800
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,200
Yeah, that should get us what we need.

801
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:36,086
Let's do this.

802
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:42,096
Ugh... shit.

803
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:44,310
That's not part of the fucking plan.

804
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:45,971
The bastards closed down the branch.

805
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:49,482
What now, little brother?

806
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:52,902
Coleman.

807
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,806
- What the hell you doing?
- We gotta head to Post.

808
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:31,316
- What the hell are you doing?
- Get...

809
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:40,234
- We got to head to Post.
- What are you talking about?

810
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,198
We got to head to Post.

811
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,452
We're going to Coleman.

812
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:44,954
There's only one teller in Coleman.

813
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:46,535
Whatever we get won't be enough.

814
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:49,208
We go to Coleman right now.

815
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:50,493
If that ain't enough, we head to Post.

816
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:53,163
If we don't leave now for Post,
we won't get there till noon.

817
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:55,048
You don't wanna rob a bank
at lunchtime, do you?

818
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:57,709
Yeah, we don't know the patterns
of folks out there.

819
01:03:57,876 --> 01:03:59,423
The patterns are the same everywhere.

820
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:01,680
All these towns are dead.
Post ain't no different.

821
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:04,014
It's a bigger bank.

822
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:07,101
We'll leave your car just out of town.

823
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,352
Come on, now.

824
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:11,060
Shit.

825
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,235
I think I got this figured.

826
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:25,738
First two banks,
they were Texas Midland Banks.

827
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:28,786
All right, there are seven
branches altogether.

828
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:31,076
The main branch is in Fort Worth.

829
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:32,710
They're not gonna mess with that.

830
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:37,462
All right, they hit the branch in Olney.

831
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:40,252
They hit the one in Archer City.

832
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:43,388
- Then there's the one here.
- Which they did not hit.

833
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:49,102
Alberto, will you please follow me?

834
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:54,641
Don't let... just keep your mouth shut
and just listen to what I'm gonna say.

835
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:56,230
There's the one here...

836
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:59,354
then there's the one in Childress.

837
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:00,864
There's the one in Jayton.

838
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:02,365
That one's closed.

839
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:04,276
I know that one's closed!

840
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:09,664
I know that one's closed, Alberto.

841
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:14,036
That's my point.

842
01:05:14,202 --> 01:05:16,625
Jayton is closed.

843
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:18,290
That just leaves Post.

844
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:20,003
They're not gonna mess
with the bank in Childress.

845
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:23,386
That's a fairly decent-sized town.

846
01:05:23,545 --> 01:05:26,264
The branch in Vernon
wasn't Midlands and they hit that.

847
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:28,801
Yeah, one of them did. Alone.

848
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:31,061
Then he ran all the way
across the road to get to the car.

849
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:34,272
I think his partner had no idea
that was gonna happen.

850
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:35,523
What does that mean to us?

851
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:39,277
It means that the only branch
that fits the bill is in Post.

852
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:40,483
Well, then let's go.

853
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,217
The town looks busy.

854
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:12,932
Little bit.

855
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:23,063
My word.

856
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:34,874
It's too big.

857
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:36,330
That's what she said.

858
01:06:39,621 --> 01:06:41,544
It's no good.

859
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:43,800
Aw, this ain't your first rodeo.

860
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,257
Bigger bank...

861
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:50,594
more money.

862
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:12,245
Everybody, get on the fucking ground!

863
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:13,996
Get on the fucking ground!

864
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:17,409
Young ladies, get on
the fucking ground! Now!

865
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:21,876
Sir, down! On the ground! Now!

866
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,585
Thank you very much.

867
01:07:27,335 --> 01:07:28,587
Tellers, stand up!

868
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:32,761
Open the drawers!

869
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:37,937
Get down!

870
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:40,144
Take three steps back!

871
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,684
Open the fucking drawer, young lady!

872
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,272
Are you deaf and dumb?

873
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:46,654
I said open the motherfucking drawer!

874
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:48,440
- You, down!
- All right. Oh, please.

875
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:50,449
Now step back!

876
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:52,694
Very good.

877
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:54,703
Someone's paying attention.

878
01:07:56,573 --> 01:08:00,669
Now get on your motherfucking knees!

879
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:01,919
Hey!

880
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,380
Stay down!

881
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:14,091
All right.

882
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:36,446
Dude.

883
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:49,546
Hey, hey, let's go!

884
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:51,052
Call 911!

885
01:08:52,587 --> 01:08:54,055
Jesus fucking Christ.

886
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:57,550
The whole goddamn town is shooting at us.

887
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:01,138
Get in the back. Get in the fucking back.

888
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:16,194
Come on, let's go! Get in the car!

889
01:09:16,361 --> 01:09:17,453
Don't let them get away!

890
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:22,959
How you doing back there, little brother?

891
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:24,460
You fucking killed them.

892
01:09:24,619 --> 01:09:28,377
These concealed carry permits sure
complicate a bank robbery, don't they?

893
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:30,166
It's not my fault it was payday.

894
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:36,465
This has gone too far, Tan.

895
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:38,508
No one was supposed to fucking die.

896
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:41,224
It was them or us. Take your pick.

897
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:57,485
Yeah, go, Margaret.

898
01:09:57,652 --> 01:09:59,871
Texas Midlands in Post has just been hit.

899
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,327
Ah! What did I tell you?

900
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:03,537
Yeah.

901
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,668
- Yeah!
- Locals are in chase.

902
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:09,293
Suspects escaping west in an old Bronco.

903
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:11,924
All right, Margaret, keep us posted.
We're on our way there.

904
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:13,926
Give me an Indian whoop. Come on.

905
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:18,093
These boys are gonna go down.

906
01:10:18,256 --> 01:10:20,930
Let's get some giddy-up music
going on there.

907
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:26,310
Oh, please, not that.

908
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:47,125
Yeah.

909
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:52,332
Hey, hey. Come on. Snap out of it.

910
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:58,338
Snap the fuck out of it.

911
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:00,677
Shit, let me see that. You're hit.

912
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,308
Boy, you're hit. Get the back.

913
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:07,396
Well, you'll live.
It's a through and through.

914
01:11:07,555 --> 01:11:11,230
Compress it. Wrap it up.
You got to wrap it up tight.

915
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:12,769
Front and back, front and back.

916
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:16,485
Wrap it tight.

917
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:25,911
Oh, brother, hear me now, hear me clear.

918
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:28,667
Unless you wanna be a black mark
on your sons' lives,

919
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:30,920
I need you mountain lion mean.

920
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:32,796
You hear me?

921
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:34,047
I hear you.

922
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:35,459
- Mountain lion mean.
- Yeah.

923
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:39,471
Yeah. It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

924
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:40,801
- Hold on.
- Yeah.

925
01:12:37,812 --> 01:12:38,813
Go.

926
01:12:50,241 --> 01:12:51,367
Here, take the money.

927
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:57,340
- Let's go.
- Get to the casino.

928
01:12:57,498 --> 01:12:58,750
Change the money like we planned.

929
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:02,216
This was your plan, and it worked.

930
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:03,721
Every step of the way.

931
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:06,098
Trust it.

932
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:12,848
Where are you headed?

933
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:20,028
Don't be stupid.

934
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:24,946
I love you, Toby.

935
01:13:28,696 --> 01:13:29,822
I mean it.

936
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:38,335
I love you, too.

937
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:46,555
Hey, Tobe, go fuck yourself.

938
01:13:46,714 --> 01:13:47,886
Go fuck yourself.

939
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:08,157
As I walked out one sunny morning

940
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:11,664
I spied a young cowboy a loping along

941
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:13,699
His hat was laid back

942
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:15,834
His spurs were a jinglin'

943
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:19,372
And as he come near me
He's singing this song

944
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,963
Yippee hiyiyo. You little doggies.

945
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:30,679
It's your misfortune and none of my own

946
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:02,172
This is what they call
white man's intuition.

947
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:05,547
Sometimes a blind pig finds a truffle.

948
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:17,181
It's your misfortune and none of my own

949
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:03,692
Back up! Oh, shit!

950
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:05,478
Go! Move!

951
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:17,832
My word.

952
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:22,078
All right, We're gonna need a SWAT unit
up here and a helo to pin these boys down.

953
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:35,015
Suspect is a white male.

954
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:37,430
Guys, spread it out!

955
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:40,353
He's got a rifle. Get down!

956
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:42,390
He's on the ridge! He's on the ridge!

957
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:46,144
Come on, I see him!

958
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:50,022
There's just one?

959
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:51,361
Yep, just one.

960
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:52,776
There's supposed to be two of them.

961
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:54,990
Maybe the town folks got one.

962
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:58,623
Well, if they did, they got the smart one.

963
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:00,783
This old boy is out of his mind.

964
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:04,580
Why don't you slip up this canyon
and tomahawk that son of a bitch?

965
01:17:23,556 --> 01:17:25,558
Ranger down. Call it in.

966
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:29,649
Get back! Back! Back those trucks up!

967
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:32,439
Get back!

968
01:17:33,691 --> 01:17:35,159
Get these trucks back.

969
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:36,990
Back up!

970
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:40,455
Back them up.

971
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:42,082
How well do you know the land around here?

972
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:44,164
Like the back of my hand.

973
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:46,749
All right, he's hid up
in that brush on that hill.

974
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:48,414
Can you get me up there behind him?

975
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:52,502
Give me a half hour, I'll have that bastard
field dressed on the hood of my truck.

976
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:54,420
I can't let you do that.
You just get me there.

977
01:17:54,587 --> 01:17:56,635
That's gonna be a 500-yard shot
if he's where you said.

978
01:17:56,797 --> 01:17:57,923
Just get me there!

979
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:13,777
Shit.

980
01:18:58,150 --> 01:18:59,276
How are you doing?

981
01:18:59,443 --> 01:19:01,662
Good. You?

982
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:03,072
Where are you headed?

983
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:04,331
Ruidoso.

984
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:07,539
Where you from?

985
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:08,748
Hamlin.

986
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:12,627
Taking the scenic route?

987
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:16,260
Taking the only way I can.

988
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:17,635
They got the road closed at Post.

989
01:19:17,795 --> 01:19:19,718
Everywhere you turn
they got the road closed.

990
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:23,392
- You got your license on you?
- Yes, I do.

991
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:29,397
Wait right there.

992
01:19:29,556 --> 01:19:30,648
Yes, sir.

993
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:10,306
- Sir.
- Yeah.

994
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:13,525
Have a good day.

995
01:20:13,684 --> 01:20:14,776
Thanks much.

996
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:19,171
You're pretty winded.

997
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:21,961
You oughta let me take the shot.
Hell, it's my gun.

998
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:24,255
Not on your life.

999
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:25,968
He's mine.

1000
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:56,833
Just left of the tree.

1001
01:21:56,995 --> 01:21:58,087
I got him.

1002
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:15,939
I got you.

1003
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:26,067
Lord of the Plains.

1004
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:30,411
That's me.

1005
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:45,570
...definitely something
out of a dime-store novel.

1006
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:48,573
Texas Highway Patrol and the locals

1007
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:52,282
chased the robbers
to this hillside behind me,

1008
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:56,494
20 miles west of town,
where the gunfight continued.

1009
01:23:56,657 --> 01:23:58,079
And right now we do know

1010
01:23:58,242 --> 01:24:02,213
Ranger Marcus Hamilton
killed one of the gunmen

1011
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:05,921
using a rifle he actually borrowed
from a resident here.

1012
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:09,132
We don't know the name
of that suspect yet...

1013
01:25:06,393 --> 01:25:07,565
Lucky guy.

1014
01:25:10,022 --> 01:25:12,275
Just in the nick of time, too.

1015
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:13,613
What are the odds?

1016
01:25:16,903 --> 01:25:20,703
Now, this, uh, satisfies

1017
01:25:20,866 --> 01:25:23,961
both the reverse mortgage loan
and the, uh...

1018
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:26,747
and the back taxes that we've paid
on your mother's behalf.

1019
01:25:26,913 --> 01:25:29,211
We do that as courtesy, of course.

1020
01:25:33,587 --> 01:25:36,181
You can fax the release of lien
to that number.

1021
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:41,219
An attorney?

1022
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:46,521
All right, well, I'll... I'll get that
faxed over to your attorney

1023
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:47,775
by the end of the week.

1024
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:50,187
It is the end of the week.
I wanna watch you do it.

1025
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:58,788
Well, it takes a little time to prepare.

1026
01:25:58,945 --> 01:26:00,242
I got all day.

1027
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:11,212
Here we go.

1028
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:14,299
Okay. That's it.

1029
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:18,261
And it's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

1030
01:26:33,063 --> 01:26:34,406
Let me ask you a question.

1031
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:37,613
Do y'all manage trusts?

1032
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:44,992
Hey, Marcus,
ain't you supposed to be retired?

1033
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:46,205
Howdy.

1034
01:26:51,373 --> 01:26:53,626
- Shelley.
- Nice to see you.

1035
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:55,669
- Well, hey, Marcus.
- Hey, Margaret.

1036
01:26:55,836 --> 01:26:57,383
Been awhile. How's life as a civilian?

1037
01:26:57,546 --> 01:27:01,050
Oh, just, you know...

1038
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:04,186
Think I can take a peek
at Mr. Howard's file?

1039
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:05,516
Tanner Howard.

1040
01:27:07,013 --> 01:27:09,983
Oh, come on.
I ain't got nothing better to do.

1041
01:27:10,142 --> 01:27:11,268
It's at my desk.

1042
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:13,520
Uh...

1043
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:21,112
Killed his father
in a hunting accident, huh?

1044
01:27:21,278 --> 01:27:24,202
I'd love to know what he was hunting
in the barn in April.

1045
01:27:24,364 --> 01:27:27,834
10 years in Huntsville
for aggravated assault.

1046
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:29,586
Cellmate was released in 2012.

1047
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:33,382
Before that, he served seven years
on bank robbery charges up in Big Spring.

1048
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:35,793
Been trying to track him down,
but no luck so far.

1049
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:37,677
You all are off the brother?

1050
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:39,759
There's nothing that links him
to the robberies.

1051
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:43,141
Now, what about
that little waitress in Vernon?

1052
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:44,392
Yeah, we showed her photos.

1053
01:27:44,551 --> 01:27:46,269
She said she didn't recognize him.

1054
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:48,726
Pretty upset you took
her tips as evidence.

1055
01:27:50,307 --> 01:27:51,900
She sure was sassy.

1056
01:27:52,058 --> 01:27:53,810
You show that to that old timer?

1057
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:56,696
Yep. He said he didn't look
like the fella from the diner.

1058
01:27:56,855 --> 01:27:59,153
He didn't recognize Tanner's photo either.

1059
01:27:59,316 --> 01:28:02,286
Yeah, tried to get a court order
on his bank accounts and the ranch,

1060
01:28:02,444 --> 01:28:03,491
DA wouldn't do it.

1061
01:28:03,653 --> 01:28:06,156
Toby's got no record.
He's never been arrested.

1062
01:28:06,323 --> 01:28:08,451
His only court appearance
was at his divorce.

1063
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:10,619
He don't fit the bill, Marcus.

1064
01:28:10,786 --> 01:28:12,208
People don't start out robbing banks.

1065
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:14,668
They graduate to it
like his asshole brother.

1066
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:18,051
Besides, when we was out there,
we saw two crews from Chevron

1067
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:20,463
capping wells and putting in pumpjacks.

1068
01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:24,558
Engineers out there said they're gonna
pull 2,000 barrels a month off that place.

1069
01:28:24,716 --> 01:28:27,265
You just try convincing a judge
to issue warrants on somebody

1070
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:29,100
set to clear $50,000 a month

1071
01:28:29,262 --> 01:28:32,357
for robbing $40,000 from the bank
that manages the family trust.

1072
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:34,564
Midland manages the trust?

1073
01:28:37,896 --> 01:28:40,069
You'd think they'd want
this thing figured out.

1074
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:42,109
I don't think the bank cares
about anything

1075
01:28:42,275 --> 01:28:43,948
but keeping that trust right where it is.

1076
01:28:45,028 --> 01:28:47,451
Hell, they were less cooperative
than Toby's attorney.

1077
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:53,079
Marcus, he's not a suspect
and you are retired.

1078
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,292
Oh, I hear you.

1079
01:28:59,376 --> 01:29:00,753
You like my desk?

1080
01:29:02,128 --> 01:29:03,220
I don't hate it.

1081
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:07,429
Hey, I'll see you, Marcus.

1082
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:45,740
Know who I am?

1083
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:52,368
I'm the man who killed your brother.

1084
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:53,656
I know.

1085
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:57,794
I also know you're retired
and you're trespassing.

1086
01:30:59,079 --> 01:31:02,800
Well, you could shoot me now
and be within your rights.

1087
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:05,962
You toting a gun and all, how convenient.

1088
01:31:07,128 --> 01:31:08,721
I figure you got one, too.

1089
01:31:14,761 --> 01:31:16,058
Mind if I sit?

1090
01:31:20,684 --> 01:31:21,731
Go ahead.

1091
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:46,508
You want a beer?

1092
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:50,715
Sure. I ain't on duty no more.

1093
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:02,350
Thanks.

1094
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:11,985
It's nice out here in this breeze,
huh, now that it's cooled down.

1095
01:32:22,704 --> 01:32:23,830
How did you do it?

1096
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:27,418
Oh, never mind.

1097
01:32:27,584 --> 01:32:29,507
I'll figure that out in time.

1098
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:31,763
Why? Why did you do it?

1099
01:32:33,590 --> 01:32:36,013
I know why your brother, Tanner, did it.

1100
01:32:36,176 --> 01:32:39,020
He robbed them banks because he liked it.

1101
01:32:41,473 --> 01:32:44,727
He shot my partner 300 yards away
'cause he liked it.

1102
01:32:44,893 --> 01:32:46,065
It made him feel good.

1103
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:50,778
If I hadn't blown his shit for brains out,

1104
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:54,410
there'd be a new truck out front
with jet skis

1105
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:56,446
or whatever else he could think to buy.

1106
01:32:56,613 --> 01:33:00,834
He'd spend it all just to give
an excuse to steal some more.

1107
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:02,369
But not you.

1108
01:33:04,954 --> 01:33:06,956
There's nothing new around here...

1109
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:11,087
except them pumpjacks.

1110
01:33:11,252 --> 01:33:12,845
Each one of them making you a month

1111
01:33:13,004 --> 01:33:16,258
what you and your brother stole
from all four banks combined.

1112
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:19,310
Help me understand, then.

1113
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:24,350
Help me understand why four people died...

1114
01:33:26,142 --> 01:33:29,942
so you could steal money
that it don't seem you've spent,

1115
01:33:30,105 --> 01:33:32,199
that it don't seem you need.

1116
01:33:32,357 --> 01:33:33,449
You got a family?

1117
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:35,906
My partner had a family. A big one.

1118
01:33:36,903 --> 01:33:38,905
They don't got no pumpjacks
in their backyard.

1119
01:33:39,072 --> 01:33:41,416
- I didn't kill your friend.
- Yes, you did.

1120
01:33:42,909 --> 01:33:44,957
By setting this thing in motion.

1121
01:33:46,162 --> 01:33:49,336
You expect me to believe
your dimwitted brother planned this?

1122
01:33:50,542 --> 01:33:53,591
Oh, no. This was smart.

1123
01:33:53,753 --> 01:33:54,970
This was you.

1124
01:33:58,842 --> 01:34:00,640
I've been poor my whole life.

1125
01:34:04,305 --> 01:34:06,728
So were my parents,
their parents before them.

1126
01:34:09,102 --> 01:34:10,604
It's like a disease...

1127
01:34:12,313 --> 01:34:15,283
passing from generation to generation,
becomes a sickness.

1128
01:34:15,441 --> 01:34:16,533
That's what it is.

1129
01:34:18,361 --> 01:34:20,034
Infects every person you know...

1130
01:34:21,239 --> 01:34:22,707
but not my boys.

1131
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:25,706
Not anymore.

1132
01:34:29,455 --> 01:34:30,752
This is theirs now.

1133
01:34:35,253 --> 01:34:37,096
Now, I ain't never killed
no one in my life,

1134
01:34:37,255 --> 01:34:40,259
but if you want me to start with you,
let's get on with it, old man.

1135
01:34:42,051 --> 01:34:45,100
See if you can grab that pistol
before I blast you off this porch.

1136
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:26,388
- Howdy.
- What's going on?

1137
01:35:28,056 --> 01:35:30,525
The hogs are back in the garden.

1138
01:35:30,683 --> 01:35:33,152
Feral hogs tearing up this place
something fierce.

1139
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:35,943
Who's this?

1140
01:35:36,105 --> 01:35:37,857
I'm an old friend of your husband.

1141
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,117
Ex-husband.

1142
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:43,413
I'm just working on the house.

1143
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:46,248
Oh, you don't live here?

1144
01:35:46,407 --> 01:35:49,206
No, it's not mine. It's theirs.

1145
01:35:51,788 --> 01:35:53,381
Oh.

1146
01:35:53,539 --> 01:35:55,962
The things we do for our kids, huh?

1147
01:35:58,544 --> 01:35:59,591
Well...

1148
01:36:01,631 --> 01:36:02,803
I best be going.

1149
01:36:02,966 --> 01:36:04,092
Ma'am.

1150
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:06,057
Me, too, Debbie. I'm gonna wash up,

1151
01:36:06,219 --> 01:36:08,847
be back around 9:00 tomorrow
to finish the front.

1152
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:11,437
Start painting the extension
and then help Randy with his homework

1153
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:14,478
when he gets back from school, okay?

1154
01:36:14,644 --> 01:36:15,691
Okay.

1155
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:20,237
Hey.

1156
01:36:21,484 --> 01:36:23,407
I rent a little house in town.

1157
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:28,415
If you wanna stop by and finish this
conversation, you're welcome anytime.

1158
01:36:29,867 --> 01:36:31,369
Oh, I'd like that.

1159
01:36:32,495 --> 01:36:33,667
I'll be seeing you.

1160
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:36,583
Yeah. Soon, I hope.

1161
01:36:39,085 --> 01:36:40,553
I'm ready to be done with this.

1162
01:36:40,712 --> 01:36:42,840
You'll never be done with it
no matter what.

1163
01:36:43,006 --> 01:36:45,555
It's gonna haunt you, son,
for the rest of your days.

1164
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:48,344
But you won't be alone.

1165
01:36:48,511 --> 01:36:50,058
It's gonna haunt me, too.

1166
01:36:50,221 --> 01:36:52,315
If you stop by, maybe I'll give you peace.

1167
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:56,353
Maybe. Maybe I'll give it to you.
