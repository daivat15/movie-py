00:20:46,154 --> 00:20:49,241
Well, you know
what I did today?

163
00:20:49,366 --> 00:20:54,413
I, uh, I won the Pennsylvania Lottery
in the morning,

164
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:56,373
I quit my jobs,

165
00:20:56,498 --> 00:21:01,461
<i>and I ate a big picnic in the park
with lots of chocolate mousse pie.</i>

166
00:21:01,587 --> 00:21:04,882
<i>And then I swam
in the fountain all afternoon.</i>

167
00:21:05,007 --> 00:21:06,925
<i>What'd you do?</i>

168
00:21:12,306 --> 00:21:15,767
I was picked first for
kick ball teams at recess.

169
00:21:15,893 --> 00:21:17,769
I hit a grand slam
to win the game.

170
00:21:17,895 --> 00:21:21,940
<i>Everybody lifted me up
on their shoulders
and carried me around, cheering.</i>

171
00:21:26,862 --> 00:21:29,865
Well, in that case, I am gonna
make you some triangle pancakes.

172
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:32,910
You got an hour.

173
00:21:38,957 --> 00:21:40,959
<i>[Malcolm] Hi.</i>

174
00:21:45,005 --> 00:21:47,299
Wanna sit?

175
00:21:51,887 --> 00:21:54,139
<i>Don't feel like
talking today?</i>

176
00:21:57,935 --> 00:21:59,853
Wanna play a game?

177
00:22:01,563 --> 00:22:03,815
<i>It's a mind-reading game.</i>

178
00:22:03,941 --> 00:22:05,901
Here's how it works.

179
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:08,403
I read your mind.

180
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:11,782
If what I say is right, you take
one step towards the chair.

181
00:22:11,907 --> 00:22:15,911
<i>If what I say is wrong,
you take one step back...</i>

182
00:22:16,036 --> 00:22:17,913
<i>towards the doorway.</i>

183
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:21,542
If you reach the chair,
you sit down.

184
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:25,462
If you reach the door,
you can go.

185
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:28,966
<i>Wanna play?</i>

186
00:22:36,265 --> 00:22:38,141
<i>Okay.</i>

187
00:22:53,907 --> 00:22:57,244
When your mother and father
were first divorced,

188
00:22:57,369 --> 00:23:01,623
your mom went to see a doctor
like me, and he didn't help her.

189
00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:04,835
<i>So you think I'm not going
to be able to help you.</i>

190
00:23:20,934 --> 00:23:25,522
You're worried that she said
she told him things...

191
00:23:25,647 --> 00:23:27,941
things she couldn't tell
anyone else.

192
00:23:29,318 --> 00:23:31,195
Secrets.

193
00:23:38,577 --> 00:23:40,746
You have a secret,
but you don't want to tell me.

194
00:23:54,134 --> 00:23:58,222
Your dad gave you that watch
as a present just before he went away.

195
00:24:09,191 --> 00:24:11,568
He forgot it in a drawer.

196
00:24:11,693 --> 00:24:13,570
Doesn't work.

197
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:29,044
You keep pretty quiet
in school, but...

198
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:33,966
you're a good student, you've never
really been in any serious trouble.

199
00:24:41,306 --> 00:24:43,183
<i>We were supposed
to draw a picture.</i>

200
00:24:43,308 --> 00:24:45,435
Anything we wanted.

201
00:24:48,397 --> 00:24:51,358
I drew a man.

202
00:24:51,483 --> 00:24:54,403
He got hurt in the neck by
another man with a screwdriver.

203
00:24:58,073 --> 00:25:00,742
You saw that on TV, Cole?

204

<i>[Footsteps]</i>

205
00:25:04,329 --> 00:25:06,707
Everyone got upset.

206
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,627
They had a meeting.

207
00:25:10,752 --> 00:25:12,629
Mom started crying.

208
00:25:12,754 --> 00:25:15,215
<i>I don't draw
like that anymore.</i>

209
00:25:17,384 --> 00:25:19,428
How do you draw now?

210
00:25:21,722 --> 00:25:25,058
I draw... people smiling,

211
00:25:25,183 --> 00:25:27,144
dogs running,

212
00:25:28,604 --> 00:25:30,480
rainbows.

213
00:25:31,773 --> 00:25:34,860
They don't have meetings
about rainbows.

214
00:25:35,986 --> 00:25:39,198
No. I guess they don't.

215
00:25:48,123 --> 00:25:50,667
What am I thinking now?

216
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:54,296
I don't know
what you're thinking now.

[Sighs]

221
00:26:25,702 --> 00:26:29,206
I thought you meant the other Italian
restaurant I asked you to marry me in.

222

[Sighs]

223

I'm so sorry, Anna.

224
00:26:39,758 --> 00:26:42,386
I just can't seem
to keep track of time.

225
00:26:45,097 --> 00:26:48,100
And I didn't have
a very good session today.

226
00:26:52,521 --> 00:26:55,315
They're both so similar.

227
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,820
The same mannerisms, same expressions,
same things hanging over their head.

228
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,701
I think it might be
some kind of abuse.

229
00:27:06,785 --> 00:27:10,205
Cole has...
scratches on his arm.

230
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,916
I think they might be
fingernail cuts.

231
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:15,335
Defensive cuts, maybe.
I don't know.

232
00:27:16,879 --> 00:27:20,257
[Sighs]
Maybe a teacher or a neighbor.

233
00:27:20,382 --> 00:27:25,095
I don't think it's the mother.
I've seen her with him,
and it doesn't seem to fit.

234
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:30,475
Or I could just be wrong.

235
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:33,645
Maybe he's just a kid
who likes to climb trees a lot.

- [Children Chattering]

246

I walk this way to school

No.

Yes.

- I don't tell her things.
- Why not?

255

- I don't want her to know.

Hey.

You are not a freak.
Okay?

260
00:29:01,024 --> 00:29:05,779
Don't you believe anybody that tries to
convince you of that. That's bullshit.

261
00:29:05,904 --> 00:29:08,240
You don't have to go through
your life believing that.

262
00:29:09,992 --> 00:29:11,910
Okay?

<i>How come?</i>

275
00:30:54,721 --> 00:30:58,433
Well, sometimes we do things
to draw attention,

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:03,647
<i>to express our feelings
about certain issues...</i>

divorce, whatever.

<i>[Cole] No.</i>

281
00:31:21,456 --> 00:31:25,669
<i>[Malcolm] Free association writing
is when you take a pencil in your hand,</i>

282
00:31:25,794 --> 00:31:31,133
<i>and you put the pencil to a piece
of paper and you start writing.</i>

283
00:31:31,258 --> 00:31:33,886
<i>And you don't look
at what you're writing or
think about what you're writing.</i>

<i>You just keep
your hand moving.</i>

<i>And after a while, if you keep
your hand moving long enough,</i>

00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,897
<i>words and thoughts start coming out that
you didn't even know you had in you.</i>

287
00:31:45,022 --> 00:31:50,485
<i>It could be something
you heard somewhere else,</i>

<i>or feelings you had
deep inside of you.</i>

Instead of something I want,
can it be something I don't want?

Okay.
