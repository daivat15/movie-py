Mr. Dufresne,

19
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:12,121
describe the confrontation you had
with your wife the night she was murdered.

20
00:02:16,752 --> 00:02:18,878
It was very bitter.

21
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:23,382
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around...

22
00:02:24,802 --> 00:02:28,346
And she said she wanted a divorce in Reno.

23
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,264
What was your response?

24
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:32,308
I told her I would not grant one.

25
00:02:32,392 --> 00:02:35,436
"I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."

26
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:39,190
Those were the words you used, Mr. Dufresne,
according to your neighbors.

27
00:02:40,317 --> 00:02:43,986
If they say so.
I really don't remember. I was upset.

28
00:02:45,114 --> 00:02:48,616
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

29
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,618
She packed a bag.

30
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:54,872
She packed a bag to go and stay with...
Mr. Quentin.

33
00:02:59,503 --> 00:03:03,381
The man you discovered was your wife's lover.

34
00:03:05,134 --> 00:03:06,509
Did you follow her?

35
00:03:07,761 --> 00:03:09,929
I went to a few bars first.

36
00:03:10,013 --> 00:03:12,890
Later, I drove to his house to confront them.

37
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:16,561
They weren't home, so I...parked in the turnout,

38
00:03:16,645 --> 00:03:18,229
and waited.

39

00:03:24,778 --> 00:03:26,445
Drunk.

43
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:31,200
I think...mostly, I wanted to scare them.

44
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:34,537
When they arrived,
you went up to the house and murdered them.

45
00:03:34,621 --> 00:03:37,707
No. I was sobering up.

46
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,543
I got back in the car,
and I drove home to sleep it off.

47
00:03:40,627 --> 00:03:44,088
Along the way, I stopped,
and I threw my gun into the Royal River.

48
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:46,382
I feel I've been very clear on this point.

49
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:50,261
Well, where I get hazy is where the cleaning
woman shows up the following morning

50
00:03:50,345 --> 00:03:56,017
and finds your wife in bed with her lover,
riddled with .38 caliber bullets.

51
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,314
Now, does that strike you as a fantastic
coincidence, Mr. Dufresne, or is it just me?

52
00:04:01,398 --> 00:04:03,232
<font color="#ff00ff">(Whispers)</font> Yes, it does.

53
00:04:03,317 --> 00:04:09,405
Yet you still maintain that you threw your gun
into the river before the murders took place?

54
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:13,284
- That's very convenient.
- It's the truth.

55
00:04:13,368 --> 00:04:18,080
<font color="#808080">DA :</font> The police dragged that river
for three days, and nary a gun was found.

56
00:04:18,165 --> 00:04:20,958
So, there could be no comparison made
between your gun

57
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:25,213
and the bullets taken from
the bloodstained corpses of the victims.

58
00:04:26,506 --> 00:04:29,383
And that also...

59

Isn’t it, Mr. Dufresne?

61
00:04:34,264 --> 00:04:36,515
Since I am innocent of this crime, sir,

62
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,186
I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

A revolver holds six bullets.

80

Not eight.

81
00:05:40,622 --> 00:05:44,083
I submit that this was not a hot-blooded
crime of passion.

82
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:47,211
That could be understood, if not condoned.

83
00:05:47,296 --> 00:05:49,922
No. This was revenge...

84
00:05:50,007 --> 00:05:54,510

and cold-blooded nature. Consider this.

<i>Not six shots fired, but eight.</i>

87
00:05:59,683 --> 00:06:03,602
<i>That means that he fired the gun empty,</i>

88
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:05,980
<i>and then stopped to reload...</i>

89

297
00:21:56,139 --> 00:21:58,557
Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop.

298
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:05,355
I'm going to look after him
until he's big enough to fly.

299
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,232
Oh, no, no. Here he comes.

300
00:22:10,361 --> 00:22:14,281
Morning, fellas. Fine morning, ain't it?

301
00:22:14,365 --> 00:22:16,784
You know why it's a fine morning, don't you?

302
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:19,286
Come on. Set 'em down.
I want 'em all lined up here,

303
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:22,164
just like a pretty little chorus line.

304
00:22:22,248 --> 00:22:24,333
Yeah, look at that!

305
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:27,294
- Look at that. Oh, Lord!
- I can't stand this guy.

- Smell my ass!
- After he smells mine.

309
00:22:33,426 --> 00:22:38,764
Gee, Red, it was a terrible shame
about your horse coming in last, an' all.

310
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:42,059
But I sure do love that winning horse of mine,
though.

311
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:44,853
I owe that boy a great big, sloppy kiss
when I see him.

312
00:22:44,938 --> 00:22:47,940
Why don't you give him some of your cigarettes,
instead?

313
00:22:48,024 --> 00:22:49,817
Lucky fuck.

314
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:51,610
Hey, Tyrell.

315
00:22:51,694 --> 00:22:54,655
You pull infirmary duty this week?

316
00:22:54,739 --> 00:22:56,448
How's that horse of mine doing?

317
00:22:56,533 --> 00:22:57,991
Dead.

318
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:03,455
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.
The doc had already gone home for the night.

319
00:23:03,456 --> 00:23:06,208
Poor bastard lay there till this morning.

320
00:23:06,292 --> 00:23:09,127
By then, hell, there weren't nothing we could do.

321
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:16,510
What was his name?

322
00:23:19,764 --> 00:23:21,139
What did you say?

323
00:23:23,017 --> 00:23:25,394
I was just wondering if anyone knew his name.

324
00:23:25,478 --> 00:23:28,188
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

325
00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:33,026
It doesn't fuckin' matter what his name was.
He's dead.

326
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,715
Hey...

327
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,551
Anybody come at you yet?

328
00:23:59,053 --> 00:24:01,054
Anybody get to you yet?

329
00:24:02,181 --> 00:24:05,225
Hey, we all need friends in here.

330
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,227
I could be a friend to you.

331
00:24:09,689 --> 00:24:11,356
Hey...

332
00:24:16,195 --> 00:24:18,071

333

- Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

You think your shit smells sweeter than most.
Is that right?

351

354
00:25:36,943 --> 00:25:40,445
I'm known to locate certain things,
from time to time.

355
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:43,532
- I wonder if you might get me a rock hammer.
- A what?

356
00:25:43,616 --> 00:25:44,992
A rock hammer.

357
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:47,369
- What is it, and why?
- What do you care?

358
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:52,124
Well, if it was a toothbrush, I'd just quote a price,

359
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:54,793
but then a toothbrush is a non-lethal object.

00:25:56,212 --> 00:25:57,921
Fair enough.

361
00:25:58,006 --> 00:26:00,465
A rock hammer
is about six or seven inches long.

362
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,175
Looks like a miniature pickaxe.

363
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,385
Pickaxe?

364
00:26:03,469 --> 00:26:05,554
- For rocks.
- Rocks.

365
00:26:07,223 --> 00:26:09,391
Quartz?

366
00:26:09,475 --> 00:26:11,143
Quartz.

367
00:26:12,395 --> 00:26:14,771
And some mica.

368
00:26:14,856 --> 00:26:16,023
Shale.

369
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:18,692
Limestone.

370
00:26:18,776 --> 00:26:20,694
So?

371
00:26:20,778 --> 00:26:22,863
So, I'm a rock hound.

372
00:26:22,947 --> 00:26:26,158
At least, I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again on a limited basis.

373
00:26:26,242 --> 00:26:28,368
Or maybe you want
to hammer somebody's skull.

374
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:29,911
No, sir.

375
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,622
I have no enemies here.

376
00:26:32,707 --> 00:26:35,083
No? Wait a while.

377
00:26:36,627 --> 00:26:38,795
Word gets around.

378
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,007
The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.

379

Especially Bogs.

380

I don't suppose it would help any
if I explained to them I'm not homosexual.

Well, that's free.

387
00:27:10,244 --> 00:27:12,496
You understand my concern.

388
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:15,123
Well, if there's any trouble,
I won't use the hammer.

389
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:19,419
Then I guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

390
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,672
Did I miss something? What's funny?

391
00:27:22,757 --> 00:27:25,801
You'll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

392
00:27:27,678 --> 00:27:29,679
What's an item like this usually go for?

393
00:27:29,764 --> 00:27:32,808
Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.

394
00:27:32,892 --> 00:27:35,602
My normal mark-up's 20 per cent.

395
00:27:35,603 --> 00:27:38,146
But this is a specialty item.

396
00:27:38,231 --> 00:27:40,816
The risk goes up, the price goes up.

397
00:27:40,817 --> 00:27:42,776
Let's make it an even ten bucks.

398
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,736
Ten it is.

399
00:27:45,822 --> 00:27:48,240
Waste of money, if you ask me.

400
00:27:48,324 --> 00:27:49,866
Why's that?

401
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:53,995
Folks around this joint love surprise inspections.

402
00:27:55,581 --> 00:27:57,874
If they find it, you're gonna lose it.

403
00:27:57,959 --> 00:28:00,085
If they do catch you with it, you don't know me.

404
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:02,379
Mention my name, we never do business again.

405
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:05,590
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now, you got that?

406
00:28:07,093 --> 00:28:08,510
I understand.

Why do they call you that?

412
00:28:21,732 --> 00:28:23,817
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

<i>Things went on like that for a while.</i>

454
00:32:32,316 --> 00:32:34,943
<i>Prison life consists of routine...</i>

455
00:32:35,027 --> 00:32:37,237
<i>and then more routine.</i>

456

460
00:32:52,696 --> 00:32:55,240
<i>That was his routine.</i>

461
00:32:55,324 --> 00:32:59,118

those first two years were the worst for him.</i>

do you trust your wife?

00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,531
Oh, that's funny.

00:35:41,615 --> 00:35:44,492
You're gonna look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

519
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:48,037
I mean, do you think

That's it. Step aside, Mert.

He's gonna push him off.

523
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:58,047
Cos if you do trust her,
there's no reason you can't keep that 35,000.

524
00:35:58,132 --> 00:36:00,008
- What did you say?
- 35,000.

525
00:36:00,092 --> 00:36:01,801
- 35,000?
- All of it.

526
00:36:01,802 --> 00:36:04,137
- All of it?
- Every penny.

527
00:36:04,221 --> 00:36:06,055
You'd better start making sense.

528
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,474
If you want to keep the money,
give it to your wife.

529
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:12,687
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

530
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:14,313
Bullshit! Tax-free?

531
00:36:14,314 --> 00:36:17,483
Tax-free. The IRS can't touch one cent.

532
00:36:17,568 --> 00:36:20,153
You're the smart banker what killed his wife.

533
00:36:20,237 --> 00:36:23,781
Why should I believe a smart banker like you?
So I can end up in here with you?

534
00:36:23,866 --> 00:36:25,366
It's legal. Ask the IRS.

535
00:36:25,451 --> 00:36:28,661
They'll say the same thing.
But I feel stupid telling you this.

536
00:36:28,746 --> 00:36:31,039
I'm sure you would have investigated the matter.

537
00:36:31,123 --> 00:36:35,209
Yeah, I don't need no banker to tell me
where the bears shit in the buckwheat.

538
00:36:35,294 --> 00:36:38,337
Of course not, but you do need someone
to set up the tax-free gift.

539
00:36:38,422 --> 00:36:40,298
It'll cost you. A lawyer.

540
00:36:40,382 --> 00:36:42,717
A bunch of ball-washing bastards.

541
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:46,637
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

542
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:49,015
If you get the forms, I'll prepare them for you.

543
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:50,975
Nearly free of charge.

544
00:36:52,061 --> 00:36:55,438
I'd only ask three beers apiece

546
00:36:58,025 --> 00:37:01,486

One side in alabaster, the opposing side

Well, here she is.

757
00:52:23,943 --> 00:52:26,486
Shawshank Prison library.

758
00:52:26,571 --> 00:52:29,448
National Geographics.

759
00:52:29,532 --> 00:52:32,367
Reader's Digest condensed books.

760
00:52:32,452 --> 00:52:34,745
Louis L'Amour.

761
00:52:34,746 --> 00:52:36,872
Look Magazine.

762
00:52:36,956 --> 00:52:39,458
Erle Stanley Gardners.

763
00:52:39,542 --> 00:52:43,086
Every evening,
I load up the cart and make my round.

764
00:52:43,087 --> 00:52:46,256
I enter the names on this clipboard here.

765
00:52:46,341 --> 00:52:49,801
Easy-peasy, Japanesey. Any questions?

766
00:52:49,886 --> 00:52:52,846
Brooks, how long have you been librarian?

767
00:52:52,931 --> 00:52:58,101
Oh...I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1912.

768
00:52:58,186 --> 00:53:01,563
And in all that time,
have you ever had an assistant?

769
00:53:01,648 --> 00:53:04,233
No. No, not much to it, really.

770
00:53:04,317 --> 00:53:06,235
Well, why me? Why now?

771
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:07,819
I don't know,

772
00:53:07,904 --> 00:53:11,240
but it'll be nice to have some company
down here for a change.

773
00:53:11,241 --> 00:53:13,325
<font color="#808080">HADLEY :</font> Dufresne!

774
00:53:22,627 --> 00:53:24,711
That's him. That's the one.

775
00:53:32,262 --> 00:53:33,553
I'm Dekins.

776
00:53:33,638 --> 00:53:36,098
<font color="#ff00ff">(Nervously)</font> I was er...

777
00:53:36,182 --> 00:53:40,185
thinking about maybe setting up
some kind of trust fund for my kids' educations.

778
00:53:42,522 --> 00:53:43,981
Oh...

779
00:53:44,065 --> 00:53:45,732
I see.

780
00:53:47,193 --> 00:53:49,069
Well, erm...

781
00:53:50,446 --> 00:53:51,989
..why don't we have a seat,

782
00:53:52,073 --> 00:53:54,157
and talk it over?

783
00:53:56,703 --> 00:53:59,621
Brooks,
do you have a piece of paper and a pencil?

784
00:54:11,092 --> 00:54:12,801
Thanks.

785
00:54:12,885 --> 00:54:14,553
So...

786
00:54:15,805 --> 00:54:18,307
Mr. Dekins...

787
00:54:18,391 --> 00:54:22,853
And then Andy says to Mr. Dekins,
"Do you want your sons to go to Harvard,

788
00:54:22,937 --> 00:54:25,063
- or Yale?"
- He didn't say that?

789
00:54:25,148 --> 00:54:27,816
As God is my witness, he did!

790
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:31,278
Dekins just blinked for a second.
Then he laughed himself silly.

791
00:54:31,362 --> 00:54:33,238
And afterwards he shook Andy's hand.

792
00:54:33,323 --> 00:54:34,698
My ass!

793
00:54:34,782 --> 00:54:35,991
Shook his hand.

794
00:54:36,075 --> 00:54:39,036
Hell, I...I near soiled myself! <font color="#ff00ff">(Laughs)</font>

795
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:43,332
All Andy needed was a suit and a tie
and a little jiggly hula girl on his desk,

796
00:54:43,416 --> 00:54:44,750
and he would have been:

797
00:54:44,834 --> 00:54:46,376
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please"!

798
00:54:46,461 --> 00:54:48,211
Making a few friends, Andy?

799
00:54:49,255 --> 00:54:51,214
I wouldn't say "friends".

800
00:54:51,299 --> 00:54:55,302
I'm a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning.

801
00:54:55,386 --> 00:54:57,721
It's a wonderful pet to have.

802
00:54:57,805 --> 00:54:59,723
Got you out of the laundry, though.

803
00:54:59,807 --> 00:55:02,017
Well, it might do more than that.

804
00:55:02,101 --> 00:55:05,103
How about expanding the library?
Get some new books in there.

805
00:55:05,188 --> 00:55:07,898
If you're gonna ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

806
00:55:07,982 --> 00:55:10,442
- Right.
- How do you expect to do that?

807
00:55:10,526 --> 00:55:15,781
I mean, get new books in here,
Mr. Dufresne, if you please?

808
00:55:15,865 --> 00:55:17,616
Ask the Warden for funds.

809
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:18,950
<font color="#ff00ff">(Laughter)</font>

810
00:55:19,035 --> 00:55:22,329
Son, son. Six wardens
have been through here in my tenure,

811
00:55:22,413 --> 00:55:26,041
and I've learned one immutable, universal truth.

812
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:27,834
Not one of them born...

813
00:55:27,835 --> 00:55:32,798
whose asshole wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you asked them for funds.

814
00:55:32,882 --> 00:55:35,175
The budget's stretched thin, as it is.

815
00:55:35,259 --> 00:55:36,510
I see.

816
00:55:36,594 --> 00:55:40,138
Perhaps I could write to the State Senate
and request funds from them.

817
00:55:40,223 --> 00:55:44,601
As far as they're concerned, there's only three
ways to spend money when it comes to prisons:

818
00:55:44,685 --> 00:55:46,770
more walls, more bars and more guards.

819
00:55:46,854 --> 00:55:51,274
Still, I'd like to try, with your permission.
A letter a week. They can't ignore me forever.

820
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:52,901
Sure can.

821
00:55:52,985 --> 00:55:55,862
But you write your letters, if it makes you happy.

822
00:55:55,947 --> 00:55:58,240
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

823
00:56:00,159 --> 00:56:03,203
<i><font color="#808080">RED :</font> So, Andy started writing a letter a week,</i>

824
00:56:03,287 --> 00:56:05,372
<i>just like he said.</i>

825
00:56:09,419 --> 00:56:13,547
<i>And, just like Norton said, Andy got no answers.</i>

826
00:56:21,389 --> 00:56:26,893
<i>The following April, Andy did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.</i>

827
00:56:26,978 --> 00:56:30,063
<i>The year after that, he did them all...</i>

828
00:56:30,148 --> 00:56:32,232
<i>including the Warden's.</i>

829
00:56:33,609 --> 00:56:37,362
<i>The year after that, they rescheduled
the start of the intramural season</i>

830
00:56:37,447 --> 00:56:39,531
<i>to coincide with tax season.</i>

831
00:56:41,826 --> 00:56:46,037
<i>The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.</i>

832
00:56:46,122 --> 00:56:50,250
So, Moresby Prison issued you your gun,
but you had to pay for it?

833
00:56:50,334 --> 00:56:52,085
Damn right. The holster, too.

834
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:53,420
That's tax-deductible.

835
00:56:53,504 --> 00:56:54,671
You can write that off.

836
00:56:54,755 --> 00:56:58,091
<i><font color="#808080">RED :</font> Yes, sir.
Andy was a regular cottage industry.</i>

837
00:56:58,176 --> 00:57:01,219
<i>In fact, it got so busy at tax time...</i>

838
00:57:01,304 --> 00:57:03,346
<i>he was allowed a staff.</i>

839
00:57:03,431 --> 00:57:05,891
Hey, Red, can you hand me a stack of 1040s?

840
00:57:05,975 --> 00:57:08,643
<i>It got me out of the wood shop
a month out of the year,</i>

841
00:57:08,728 --> 00:57:11,396
<i>and that was fine by me.</i>

842
00:57:11,481 --> 00:57:14,858
<i>And still...he kept sending those letters.</i>

843
00:57:20,156 --> 00:57:21,990
Red, Andy.

844
00:57:22,074 --> 00:57:23,283
It's Brooks.

845
00:57:23,367 --> 00:57:25,827
<font color="#ff00ff">(Men shouting)</font>
- Watch the door.

846
00:57:25,912 --> 00:57:27,496
Please, Brooks.

847
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,581
- Just calm the fuck down.
- Stay back!

848
00:57:29,665 --> 00:57:31,708
- Stay back!
- What the hell's going on?

849
00:57:31,792 --> 00:57:34,878
You tell me. One second he's fine.
Then out comes the knife.

850
00:57:34,962 --> 00:57:37,422
Brooks, we can talk about this. Right?

851
00:57:37,507 --> 00:57:39,633
Nothing to talk about, goddamn it!

852
00:57:39,717 --> 00:57:41,426
I'm gonna cut his fucking throat.

853
00:57:41,511 --> 00:57:43,386
Heywood? Wait, what's he done to you?

854
00:57:43,471 --> 00:57:45,597
It's what they done!

855
00:57:45,681 --> 00:57:47,098
I...I got no choice...

856
00:57:47,183 --> 00:57:49,851
You're not gonna hurt him.
Even Heywood knows that.

857
00:57:49,936 --> 00:57:52,562
- Right, Heywood?
- I...I know that, sure.

858
00:57:52,647 --> 00:57:56,066
You won't hurt him, because he's a friend,
and you're a reasonable man.

859
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:57,442
That's right. Right, guys?

860
00:57:57,527 --> 00:58:00,904
- Yes.
- So, put the knife down. Brooks, look at me.

861
00:58:00,988 --> 00:58:02,822
Put the knife down.

862
00:58:03,908 --> 00:58:05,075
Brooks...

863
00:58:05,159 --> 00:58:07,410
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

864
00:58:07,495 --> 00:58:09,829
Brooks, look at his neck. It's bleeding.

865
00:58:09,914 --> 00:58:11,081
<font color="#ff00ff">(Heywood gasps)</font>

It's the only...

867
00:58:12,833 --> 00:58:15,126
It's the only way they'd let me stay.

868
00:58:15,211 --> 00:58:17,796
Come on. This is crazy.
You don't want to do this.

869
00:58:17,797 --> 00:58:19,881
Put it down.

<font color="#ff00ff">(Brooks sobs)</font>

871
00:58:27,265 --> 00:58:31,977
Come on. Take it easy.
You're going to be all right.

00:58:32,061 --> 00:58:33,436

873
00:58:33,521 --> 00:58:37,190

you've had worse from shaving.

875
00:58:39,986 --> 00:58:42,237
What the hell did you do to set him off, anyway?

876
00:58:42,321 --> 00:58:44,656
Nothing. I come in here to say fare-thee-well.

877
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:47,867
Ain't you heard? His parole's come through.

878
00:58:49,912 --> 00:58:53,039
I just don't understand what happened in there.
That's all.

879
00:58:53,124 --> 00:58:55,709
The old man's as crazy
as a rat in a tin shithouse.

880
00:58:55,793 --> 00:58:58,003
Oh, Heywood, that's enough out of you.

881
00:58:58,087 --> 00:59:01,089
- I heard he had you shitting in your pants.
- Fuck you!

882
00:59:01,173 --> 00:59:02,549
Would you knock it off?

883
00:59:02,633 --> 00:59:04,968
Brooks ain't no bug.

884
00:59:05,052 --> 00:59:06,928
He's just...

885
00:59:08,806 --> 00:59:10,640
He's just institutionalized.

886
00:59:11,976 --> 00:59:13,643
Institutionalized, my ass.

887
00:59:13,728 --> 00:59:18,023
The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood.
50 years.

888
00:59:18,107 --> 00:59:19,816
This is all he knows.

889
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,319
In here, he's an important man.

890
00:59:22,403 --> 00:59:23,862
He's an educated man.

891
00:59:23,946 --> 00:59:26,031
Outside, he's nothing.

892
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,827
Just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.

893
00:59:30,911 --> 00:59:34,122
Probably couldn't get a library card if he tried.

894
00:59:34,206 --> 00:59:36,291
You know what I'm trying to say?

895
00:59:36,375 --> 00:59:39,127
Red, I do believe you're talking out of your ass.

896
00:59:40,379 --> 00:59:43,298
You believe whatever you want, Floyd.

897
00:59:43,299 --> 00:59:45,842
But I'm telling you, these walls are funny.

898
00:59:47,261 --> 00:59:49,346
First you hate 'em...

899
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:52,974
..then you get used to 'em.

900
00:59:54,602 --> 00:59:57,228
Enough time passes...

901
00:59:57,313 --> 01:00:00,273
you get so you depend on 'em.

902
01:00:00,358 --> 01:00:02,692
That's institutionalized.

903
01:00:02,777 --> 01:00:04,152
<font color="#808080">JIGGER :</font> Shit.

904
01:00:04,153 --> 01:00:05,779

01:00:05,863 --> 01:00:07,781
Oh, yeah?

906
01:00:07,865 --> 01:00:10,450
Say that when you've been here
as long as Brooks has.

907
01:00:10,534 --> 01:00:12,410
Goddamn right.

908
01:00:14,747 --> 01:00:17,290
They send you here for life.

909
01:00:17,375 --> 01:00:19,459
That's exactly what they take.

910
01:00:21,379 --> 01:00:23,463

01:13:31,209 --> 01:13:33,544
And I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

1063
01:13:36,131 --> 01:13:38,174
No danger to society here.

1064
01:13:38,258 --> 01:13:40,342
God's honest truth.

1065
01:13:42,679 --> 01:13:44,763
Absolutely rehabilitated.

1066
01:13:54,691 --> 01:13:56,775
30 years.

1067
01:13:57,861 --> 01:13:59,904
Jesus, when they say it like that...

1068
01:13:59,988 --> 01:14:02,072
You wonder where it went.

1069
01:14:05,035 --> 01:14:07,119
I wonder where ten years went.

1070
01:14:12,167 --> 01:14:13,459
Here.

1071
01:14:13,543 --> 01:14:15,711

Go ahead and open it.

1073
01:14:19,674 --> 01:14:23,469
I had to go through one of your competitors.
I hope you don't mind.

1074
01:14:23,553 --> 01:14:25,638
I wanted it to be a surprise.

1075
01:14:35,774 --> 01:14:37,858
It's very pretty, Andy.

1076
01:14:38,944 --> 01:14:41,028
Thank you.

1077
01:14:42,781 --> 01:14:44,865

No.

No free ride.

1129
01:18:21,332 --> 01:18:24,293
But rather a genuine, progressive advance

1130
01:18:24,377 --> 01:18:26,545
in corrections and rehabilitation.

1131
01:18:27,589 --> 01:18:29,923
Our inmates, properly supervised,

1132
01:18:30,008 --> 01:18:32,760

performing all manner of public service.

1134

to the community and...

1136
01:18:42,771 --> 01:18:47,983
at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. and Mrs. John Q Taxpayer.

<i><font color="#808080">RED :</font> Of course,

<i>And, oh, my Lord, how the money rolled in.</i>

1142
01:19:03,958 --> 01:19:06,084
If this keeps up, you'll put me out of business.

1143
01:19:06,169 --> 01:19:08,337
- Ned!
- This pool of slave labor you've got,

1144
01:19:08,421 --> 01:19:10,464
you can underbid any contractor in town.

1145
01:19:10,548 --> 01:19:14,510
Ned, we're providing
a valuable community service here.

1146
01:19:14,594 --> 01:19:16,845
Well, that's fine for the papers

1147
01:19:16,930 --> 01:19:18,430

Sam...

Sam, we go back a long way.

1150
01:19:22,852 --> 01:19:25,187
I need this new highway contract.

1151
01:19:25,271 --> 01:19:27,481
I don't get it, and I go under.

1152
01:19:27,565 --> 01:19:29,608
That's a fact.

1153
01:19:29,692 --> 01:19:31,777
You just have some of this fine pie

1154

1156
01:19:43,373 --> 01:19:46,291
Ned, I wouldn't worry too much
about this contract.

1157
01:19:46,376 --> 01:19:49,586
It seems to me I already got
my boys committed elsewhere.

1158
01:19:51,464 --> 01:19:54,049
You be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie.

Night drops as always, sir.

1164
01:20:40,430 --> 01:20:42,180
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1165
01:20:42,265 --> 01:20:45,058
- Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.
- Yes, sir.

1166
01:20:45,143 --> 01:20:48,896
Tell them if they over-starch my shirts again,
they'll hear about it from me.

1167
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:50,981
How do I look?

1168
01:20:51,065 --> 01:20:53,775
- Very nice, sir.
- Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1169
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:55,569
The Governor's going to be there.

1170
01:20:56,988 --> 01:20:59,031
Want the rest of this?

1171
01:20:59,115 --> 01:21:01,199

1172
01:21:02,577 --> 01:21:04,369
Thank you, sir.

1173
01:21:06,539 --> 01:21:10,292

- What you hear isn't half of it.

1174
01:21:10,376 --> 01:21:12,836
He's got scams you haven't even dreamed of.

1175
01:21:12,921 --> 01:21:14,963
Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

1176
01:21:15,048 --> 01:21:17,925
There's a river of dirty money
running through this place.

1177
01:21:18,009 --> 01:21:21,261
But the problem with having all that money
is you'll have to explain

1178
01:21:21,346 --> 01:21:23,931
- where it came from.
- That's where I come in.

1179
01:21:24,015 --> 01:21:26,516
I channel it, filter it, funnel it.

1180
01:21:26,601 --> 01:21:29,144
Stocks, securities, tax-free municipals.

1181
01:21:29,228 --> 01:21:31,897
I send that money out into the real world.

1182
01:21:31,981 --> 01:21:35,609
- And when it comes back...
- Clean as a virgin's honey pot, huh?

1183
01:21:35,693 --> 01:21:36,902
Cleaner.

1184
01:21:36,986 --> 01:21:40,614
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

1185
01:21:43,368 --> 01:21:47,788
If they ever catch on, though, he's gonna
wind up in here wearing a number himself.

1186
01:21:47,872 --> 01:21:51,124
Now, Red, I thought you had
a little more faith in me than that.

1187
01:21:51,209 --> 01:21:54,503
I know you're good, Andy,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

1188
01:21:54,587 --> 01:21:57,589
Now, anybody gets curious,
the FBI, the IRS, whatever,

1189
01:21:57,674 --> 01:22:00,509
it's gonna lead to somebody.

1190
01:22:00,593 --> 01:22:02,552
Sure it is. But not to me.

1191
01:22:02,637 --> 01:22:04,638
And certainly not to the Warden.

1192
01:22:08,685 --> 01:22:09,977
All right. Who?

1193
01:22:10,061 --> 01:22:11,770
Randall Stevens.

1194
01:22:11,854 --> 01:22:13,021
Who?

1195
01:22:14,107 --> 01:22:18,819
The silent silent partner. He's the guilty one,
Your Honor. The man with the bank accounts.

1196
01:22:18,903 --> 01:22:21,071
That's where the filtering process starts.

1197
01:22:21,155 --> 01:22:24,324
If they trace anything,
it's just going to lead to him.

1198
01:22:24,409 --> 01:22:25,993
But who is he?

1199
01:22:26,077 --> 01:22:28,120
He's a phantom, an apparition.

1200
01:22:28,204 --> 01:22:30,163
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1201
01:22:30,248 --> 01:22:32,416
I conjured him...

1202
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,543
out of thin air.

1203
01:22:34,627 --> 01:22:37,462
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1204
01:22:40,591 --> 01:22:42,968
Andy, you can’t just make a person up.

1205
01:22:43,052 --> 01:22:46,179
Sure you can, if you know how
the system works, where the cracks are.

1206
01:22:46,264 --> 01:22:49,766
It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail.

1207
01:22:49,851 --> 01:22:52,477
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate,

1208
01:22:52,562 --> 01:22:54,896
a driver's license, social security number.

1209
01:22:54,981 --> 01:22:56,189
You're shitting me?

1210
01:22:56,274 --> 01:22:58,233
If they ever trace any of those accounts,

1211
01:22:58,317 --> 01:23:01,194
they're going to wind up chasing
a figment of my imagination.

1212
01:23:01,279 --> 01:23:03,363
Well, I'll be damned.

1213
01:23:04,657 --> 01:23:06,700

You know, the funny thing is,

1216
01:23:11,164 --> 01:23:15,125
on the outside, I was an honest man,
straight as an arrow.

1217
01:23:16,169 --> 01:23:18,545
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1218

Ever bother you?

1219
01:23:29,724 --> 01:23:33,143
I don't run the scams, Red,
I just process the profits.

1220
01:23:33,227 --> 01:23:35,270
Fine line maybe but...

1221
01:23:35,354 --> 01:23:38,065
I also built that library

1222
01:23:38,149 --> 01:23:40,776
and used it to help a dozen guys
get a high school diploma.

1223
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:42,736
Why do you think the Warden lets me do it?

1224
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:45,572
To keep you happy and doing the laundry.

1225
01:23:45,656 --> 01:23:47,783
Money instead of sheets.

1226
01:23:47,867 --> 01:23:50,577
Well, I work cheap. That's the trade-off.

"Freeze, kid! Hands in the air."

Well, I just stand there,

1245

"Do you hear what I said, boy?"

About four years ago,

I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.

1334
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:14,669
I stole a car. It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1335
01:30:15,963 --> 01:30:18,006
About six months left to go,

1336
01:30:18,090 --> 01:30:20,133
I get a new cellmate in.

1337
01:30:20,217 --> 01:30:22,093
Elmo Blatch.

1338
01:30:23,137 --> 01:30:24,721
Big, twitchy fucker.

1339
01:30:24,722 --> 01:30:27,015
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.

1340
01:30:27,099 --> 01:30:29,142
You know what I'm saying?

1341
01:30:29,226 --> 01:30:31,269
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1342
01:30:31,353 --> 01:30:34,564
He said he'd pulled hundreds of jobs.

1343
01:30:34,648 --> 01:30:36,524
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.

1344
01:30:36,609 --> 01:30:39,611
You'd cut a loud fart,
he'd jump three feet in the air.

1345
01:30:40,738 --> 01:30:42,780
Talked all the time, too.

1346
01:30:42,865 --> 01:30:45,200
That's the other thing. He never shut up.

1347
01:30:45,284 --> 01:30:47,327
Places he'd been in,

1348
01:30:47,411 --> 01:30:50,079
jobs he'd pulled, women he'd fucked.

1349
01:30:50,164 --> 01:30:52,582
Even people he'd killed.

1350
01:30:54,418 --> 01:30:56,794
People who gave him shit.

1351
01:30:57,838 --> 01:30:59,881
That's how he put it.

1352
01:30:59,965 --> 01:31:01,508
So...

1353
01:31:01,592 --> 01:31:03,676
one night, like a joke,

1354
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:08,014
I say to him, I say,
"Yeah, Elmo, who did you kill?"

1355
01:31:08,098 --> 01:31:09,891
So he says...

1356
01:31:09,975 --> 01:31:13,603
I got me this job one time
bussing tables at a country club.

1357
01:31:14,730 --> 01:31:18,316
So I could case
all these big rich pricks that come in.

1358
01:31:20,736 --> 01:31:22,737
So I pick out this guy,

1359
01:31:23,781 --> 01:31:26,366
go in one night and do his place.

1360
01:31:28,536 --> 01:31:30,537
He wakes up.

1361
01:31:30,621 --> 01:31:32,664
He gives me shit.

1362
01:31:33,707 --> 01:31:35,792
So I killed him.

1363
01:31:36,835 --> 01:31:38,920
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1364
01:31:41,215 --> 01:31:43,132
That's the best part.

1365
01:31:44,176 --> 01:31:47,387
She's fucking this prick, see, this golf pro.

1366
01:31:47,471 --> 01:31:49,556
But she's married to some other guy.

1367
01:31:50,599 --> 01:31:52,684
Some hotshot banker.

1368
01:31:54,478 --> 01:31:56,563
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1369
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:11,536
I have to say
that's the most amazing story I ever heard.

1370
01:32:13,163 --> 01:32:16,040
What amazes me most is
you were taken in by it.

1371
01:32:16,125 --> 01:32:17,750
Sir?

1372
01:32:17,835 --> 01:32:19,502
Well...

1373
01:32:19,587 --> 01:32:22,964
it's obvious this fella Williams
is impressed with you.

1374
01:32:23,048 --> 01:32:25,133
He hears your tale of woe

1375
01:32:25,217 --> 01:32:28,136
and quite naturally wants to cheer you up.

1376
01:32:28,220 --> 01:32:30,263
He's young, not terribly bright.

1377
01:32:30,347 --> 01:32:34,225
Not surprising he wouldn't know
what a state he'd put you in.

1378
01:32:34,310 --> 01:32:36,436
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1379
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:40,565
Well, let's say, for the moment,
this Blatch does exist.

1380
01:32:40,649 --> 01:32:43,776
You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry,

1381
01:32:43,861 --> 01:32:46,070
"Yes, I did it! I confess!

1382
01:32:46,155 --> 01:32:48,364
And by the way,
add a life term to my sentence"?

1383
01:32:48,449 --> 01:32:51,618
That doesn't matter.
With Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.

1384
01:32:51,702 --> 01:32:54,912
That's assuming Blatch is even still there.

1385
01:32:54,997 --> 01:32:57,040
The chances are he'd be released by now.

1386
01:32:57,124 --> 01:32:59,709
They'd have his last address,
names of relatives.

1387
01:32:59,793 --> 01:33:01,961
There's a chance, isn't there?

1388
01:33:04,006 --> 01:33:05,882
How can you be so obtuse?

1389
01:33:05,966 --> 01:33:07,467
What?

1390
01:33:08,969 --> 01:33:10,803
What did you call me?

1391
01:33:10,888 --> 01:33:12,722
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1392
01:33:12,806 --> 01:33:14,599
Son, you're forgetting yourself.

1393
01:33:14,683 --> 01:33:17,518
The country club will have his old timecards,

1394
01:33:17,603 --> 01:33:19,729
records, W-2s,

1395
01:33:19,813 --> 01:33:23,816
- with his name on them.
- If you indulge this fantasy, that's your business.

1396
01:33:23,901 --> 01:33:27,862
- Don't make it mine. This meeting is over.
- Sir, if I were to ever get out,

1397
01:33:27,946 --> 01:33:32,950
I would never mention what goes on in here.
I'd be as indictable as you for laundering money.

1398
01:33:34,745 --> 01:33:37,747
Don't ever mention money to me again,
you sorry son of a bitch!

1399
01:33:37,831 --> 01:33:39,707
Not in this office.

1400
01:33:39,708 --> 01:33:41,834
Not anywhere! Get in here now.

1401
01:33:41,919 --> 01:33:45,171
I'm just trying to set your mind at ease,
that's all. Sir, I...

1402
01:33:45,255 --> 01:33:46,631
Solitary. A month.

1403
01:33:46,715 --> 01:33:48,883
- Yes, sir.
- What's the matter with you?

1404
01:33:48,967 --> 01:33:52,220
- Get him out of here.
- This is my chance to get out! Don't you see that?

1405
01:33:52,221 --> 01:33:54,222
It's my life! Don't you understand?

1406
01:33:54,306 --> 01:33:56,766
- Get him out! Get him out!
- This is my life!

1407
01:33:56,850 --> 01:33:58,101
No!

1408
01:33:58,185 --> 01:34:00,019
A month in the hole.

1409
01:34:00,104 --> 01:34:02,689
It's the longest damn stretch I ever heard of.

1410
01:34:02,773 --> 01:34:04,565
It's all my fault.

1411
01:34:04,650 --> 01:34:06,067
Oh, bullshit.

1412
01:34:06,151 --> 01:34:09,445
You didn't pull the trigger
and you certainly didn't convict him.

1413
01:34:09,530 --> 01:34:11,906
Red, are you saying that Andy is innocent?

1414
01:34:11,990 --> 01:34:14,158
I mean, for real innocent?

1415
01:34:14,243 --> 01:34:16,285
It looks that way.

1416
01:34:16,370 --> 01:34:18,413
Sweet Jesus.

1417
01:34:18,497 --> 01:34:20,540
How long's he been here now?

1418
01:34:20,624 --> 01:34:22,667
1947. What is that?

1419
01:34:22,751 --> 01:34:24,293
- 19 years.
<font color="#808080">TOMMY :</font> 19 years...

1420
01:34:24,378 --> 01:34:27,004

- Yeah, over here.

1421
01:34:29,383 --> 01:34:31,634
- Paxon, Edward.
- Yeah.

1422
01:34:32,845 --> 01:34:35,763
What you got?
Board of Education.

1423
01:34:35,848 --> 01:34:38,516
- The son of a bitch mailed it.
- Looks like he did.

1424
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:41,644
Are you gonna open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1425
01:34:41,729 --> 01:34:43,813
The thumb up my butt sounds better.

1426
01:34:44,857 --> 01:34:47,608
Hey, Skeet, come on,
give me that, you shithead.

1427
01:34:48,652 --> 01:34:50,862
- Floyd, come on.
- Over here, over here!

1428
01:34:51,905 --> 01:34:53,990
Hey, Red!

1429
01:34:55,117 --> 01:34:57,535
Come on, will you throw that away, please?

1430
01:35:03,125 --> 01:35:05,209
Well, shit.

1431
01:35:17,431 --> 01:35:20,141
The kid passed. C+ average.

1432
01:35:20,225 --> 01:35:22,310
Thought you'd like to know.

1433
01:35:38,869 --> 01:35:40,953
The Warden wants to talk.

1434
01:35:54,343 --> 01:35:55,468
Out here?

1435
01:35:55,552 --> 01:35:57,637
That's what the man said.

1436
01:36:13,946 --> 01:36:15,738
Warden?

1437
01:36:15,823 --> 01:36:17,907
Tommy.

1438
01:36:23,372 --> 01:36:24,831
Tommy...

1439
01:36:24,915 --> 01:36:29,001
I'm asking you to keep this conversation
just between us.

1440
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:32,505
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1441
01:36:50,983 --> 01:36:53,067
We got a situation here.

1442
01:36:54,111 --> 01:36:56,153
I think you can appreciate that.

1443
01:36:56,238 --> 01:36:57,697
Yes, sir.

1444
01:36:57,781 --> 01:36:59,282
I sure can.

1445
01:36:59,366 --> 01:37:03,411
I tell you, son, this thing really came along
and knocked my wind out.

1446
01:37:05,122 --> 01:37:07,665
It's got me up nights, that's the truth.

1447
01:37:09,877 --> 01:37:11,961
The right thing to do.

1448
01:37:13,297 --> 01:37:16,299
Sometimes it's hard to know what that is.

1449
01:37:18,010 --> 01:37:20,052
You understand?

1450
01:37:21,430 --> 01:37:23,514
I need your help, son.

1451
01:37:24,933 --> 01:37:27,018
If I'm going to move on this,

1452
01:37:27,019 --> 01:37:29,770
there can't be the least little shred of doubt.

1453
01:37:31,315 --> 01:37:34,734
I have to know
if what you told Dufresne was the truth.

1454
01:37:34,818 --> 01:37:36,402
Yes, sir.

1455
01:37:36,403 --> 01:37:38,029
Absolutely.

1456
01:37:38,113 --> 01:37:41,198
Would you be willing
to swear before a judge and jury,

1457
01:37:41,283 --> 01:37:43,701
having placed your hand on the Good Book

1458
01:37:43,702 --> 01:37:46,412
and taken an oath before Almighty God himself?

1459
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:48,623
Just give me that chance.

1460
01:37:52,544 --> 01:37:54,211
That's what I thought.

1461
01:38:26,662 --> 01:38:28,746
<font color="#ff00ff">(Keys rattle)</font>

1462
01:38:41,301 --> 01:38:43,386
I'm sure by now you've heard...

1463
01:38:44,638 --> 01:38:46,013
A terrible thing.

1464
01:38:47,474 --> 01:38:51,060
A man that young, less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

1465
01:38:52,145 --> 01:38:54,772
It broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.

1466
01:38:55,816 --> 01:38:57,900
Truly, it did.

1467
01:38:59,945 --> 01:39:02,029
We just have to put it behind us.

1468
01:39:04,199 --> 01:39:05,616
Move on.

1469
01:39:07,077 --> 01:39:08,953
I'm done.

1470
01:39:09,997 --> 01:39:12,081
Everything stops.

1471
01:39:13,125 --> 01:39:15,960
Get someone else to run your scams.

1472
01:39:17,295 --> 01:39:19,380
Nothing stops.

1473
01:39:20,424 --> 01:39:22,508
Nothing.

1474
01:39:24,261 --> 01:39:26,345
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

1475
01:39:28,223 --> 01:39:30,808
No more protection from the guards.

1476
01:39:30,892 --> 01:39:33,227
I'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton

1477
01:39:33,311 --> 01:39:35,479
and cast you down with the Sodomites.

1478
01:39:37,232 --> 01:39:39,734
You'll think you've been fucked by a train.

1479
01:39:41,028 --> 01:39:43,070
And the library?

1480
01:39:43,155 --> 01:39:44,280
Gone.

1481
01:39:44,364 --> 01:39:46,741
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1482
01:39:47,784 --> 01:39:50,578
We'll have us a little book barbecue in the yard.

1483
01:39:50,662 --> 01:39:52,705
They'll see the flames for miles.

1484
01:39:52,789 --> 01:39:55,291
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1485
01:39:56,877 --> 01:39:58,794
You understand me?

1486
01:39:58,879 --> 01:40:00,963
Catching my drift?

1487
01:40:04,051 --> 01:40:06,135
Or am I being obtuse?

1488
01:40:17,272 --> 01:40:19,398
Give him another month to think about it.

1489
01:40:27,908 --> 01:40:29,992
<font color="#ff00ff">(Lock clicks)</font>

1490
01:41:06,988 --> 01:41:10,032
My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.

1491
01:41:10,117 --> 01:41:12,201
Like a closed book.

1492
01:41:13,411 --> 01:41:16,163
Complained about it all the time.

1493
01:41:16,248 --> 01:41:18,332
She was beautiful.

1494
01:41:20,544 --> 01:41:22,628
God, I loved her.

1495
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:27,967
I just didn't know how to show it, that's all.

1496
01:41:30,470 --> 01:41:32,555
I killed her, Red.

1497
01:41:34,015 --> 01:41:36,100
I didn't pull the trigger.

1498
01:41:37,519 --> 01:41:39,603
But I drove her away.

1499
01:41:40,814 --> 01:41:43,357
That's why she died, because of me.

1500
01:41:43,441 --> 01:41:45,526
The way I am.

1501
01:41:53,869 --> 01:41:55,953
That don't make you a murderer.

1502
01:41:59,166 --> 01:42:01,250
A bad husband, maybe.

1503
01:42:04,629 --> 01:42:08,007
Feel bad about it if you want to,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1504
01:42:08,091 --> 01:42:09,508
No, I didn't.

1505
01:42:09,593 --> 01:42:11,635
Somebody else did.

1506
01:42:12,929 --> 01:42:15,014
And I wound up in here.

1507
01:42:17,392 --> 01:42:19,476
Bad luck, I guess.

1508
01:42:22,397 --> 01:42:24,106
Yeah.

1509
01:42:24,191 --> 01:42:26,483
It floats around.

1510
01:42:26,568 --> 01:42:29,028
It's got to land on somebody.

1511
01:42:29,112 --> 01:42:31,363
It was my turn, that's all.

1512
01:42:32,449 --> 01:42:34,909
I was in the path of the tornado.

1513
01:42:41,499 --> 01:42:45,252
I just didn't expect
the storm would last as long as it has.

1514
01:42:49,341 --> 01:42:51,258
Do you think you'll ever get out of here?

1515
01:42:52,510 --> 01:42:54,178
Me?

1516
01:42:56,473 --> 01:42:57,932
Yeah.

1517
01:42:58,975 --> 01:43:00,935
One day, when I've got a long, white beard

1518
01:43:01,019 --> 01:43:04,521
and two or three marbles rolling around upstairs,
they'll let me out.

1519
01:43:04,941 --> 01:43:07,025
I tell you where I'd go.

1520
01:43:08,236 --> 01:43:09,862
Zihuatanejo.

1521
01:43:09,946 --> 01:43:11,864
Zi...what?

1522
01:43:11,948 --> 01:43:13,991
Zihuatanejo.

1523
01:43:14,075 --> 01:43:16,160
It's in Mexico.

1524
01:43:17,954 --> 01:43:20,164
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1525
01:43:21,416 --> 01:43:23,792
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1526
01:43:23,877 --> 01:43:25,335
No.

1527
01:43:25,420 --> 01:43:27,504
They say it has no memory.

1528
01:43:29,966 --> 01:43:32,509
That's where I want to live the rest of my life.

1529
01:43:34,095 --> 01:43:36,180
A warm place with no memory.

1530
01:43:39,476 --> 01:43:41,769
Open up a little hotel,

1531
01:43:43,605 --> 01:43:45,481
right on the beach.

1532
01:43:45,565 --> 01:43:47,608
Buy some worthless old boat,

1533
01:43:47,692 --> 01:43:49,777
fix it up new.

1534
01:43:52,739 --> 01:43:53,947
Take my guests out.

1535
01:43:54,032 --> 01:43:56,116
Charter fishing.

1536
01:44:00,038 --> 01:44:02,664
Zihuatanejo, huh?

1537
01:44:05,293 --> 01:44:09,171
In a place like that, I could use a man
who knows how to get things.

1538
01:44:15,595 --> 01:44:18,305
I don't think I could make it on the outside, Andy.

1539
01:44:25,063 --> 01:44:27,147
I've been in here most of my life.

1540
01:44:28,650 --> 01:44:30,442
I'm an institutional man now.

1541
01:44:30,527 --> 01:44:32,611
Just like Brooks was.

1542
01:44:34,030 --> 01:44:36,281
Well, you underestimate yourself.

1543
01:44:36,366 --> 01:44:38,450
I don't think so.

1544
01:44:41,079 --> 01:44:45,290
I mean...in here, I'm the guy
who can get things for you, sure.

1545
01:44:45,375 --> 01:44:49,294
But outside, all you need is the Yellow Pages.

1546
01:44:49,379 --> 01:44:51,797
Hell, I wouldn't even know where to begin.

1547
01:44:53,883 --> 01:44:56,218
The Pacific Ocean?

1548
01:44:56,302 --> 01:44:58,345
Shit.

1549
01:44:58,429 --> 01:45:01,598
- About scare me to death, something that big.
- Not me.

1550
01:45:01,683 --> 01:45:05,143
I didn't shoot my wife and I didn't shoot her lover.

1551
01:45:07,063 --> 01:45:10,691
Whatever mistakes I've made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1552
01:45:10,775 --> 01:45:12,943
That hotel, that boat.

1553
01:45:14,529 --> 01:45:16,697
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1554
01:45:21,327 --> 01:45:24,204
I don't think you ought to be
doing this to yourself, Andy.

1555
01:45:24,289 --> 01:45:26,331
These are just shitty pipe dreams.

1556
01:45:26,416 --> 01:45:29,376
I mean, Mexico is way the hell down there
and you're in here.

1557
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:31,503
And that's the way it is.

1558
01:45:31,588 --> 01:45:34,214
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

1559
01:45:35,967 --> 01:45:38,051
It's down there and I'm in here.

1560
01:45:40,763 --> 01:45:43,557
I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really.

1561
01:45:46,394 --> 01:45:48,437
Get busy living

1562
01:45:48,521 --> 01:45:51,440
or get busy dying.

1563
01:45:55,236 --> 01:45:57,321
Andy.

1564
01:45:59,782 --> 01:46:01,867
Red.

1565
01:46:02,911 --> 01:46:05,329
If you ever get out of here, do me a favor.

1566
01:46:05,413 --> 01:46:07,247
Sure, Andy.

1567
01:46:07,332 --> 01:46:08,665
Anything.

1568
01:46:09,751 --> 01:46:13,211
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1569
01:46:15,214 --> 01:46:19,009
- Well, just... There's a lot of hayfields up there.
- One in particular.

1570
01:46:19,093 --> 01:46:21,136
It's got a long rock wall

1571
01:46:21,220 --> 01:46:23,138
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1572
01:46:23,222 --> 01:46:25,933
It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.

1573
01:46:27,310 --> 01:46:30,020
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1574
01:46:31,230 --> 01:46:35,025
We went there for a picnic
and made love under that oak.

1575
01:46:36,527 --> 01:46:38,612
I asked and she said yes.

1576
01:46:42,742 --> 01:46:44,785
Promise me, Red,

1577
01:46:44,869 --> 01:46:46,870
if you ever get out,

1578
01:46:46,955 --> 01:46:48,997
find that spot.

1579
01:46:50,041 --> 01:46:55,504
At the base of that wall, you'll find a rock that has
no earthly business in a Maine hayfield.

1580
01:46:55,588 --> 01:46:58,090
A piece of black, volcanic glass.

1581
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:04,054
There's something buried under it
I want you to have.

1582
01:47:04,138 --> 01:47:06,139
What, Andy?

1583
01:47:06,224 --> 01:47:08,308
What's buried under there?

1584
01:47:10,103 --> 01:47:13,480
You'll have to pry it up to see.

1585
01:47:18,820 --> 01:47:20,904
No, I'm telling you, the guy is...

1586
01:47:21,948 --> 01:47:24,032
He's talking funnier.

1587
01:47:24,117 --> 01:47:27,494
- I'm really worried about him.
- We ought to keep an eye on him.

1588
01:47:27,578 --> 01:47:31,623
That's fine during the day,
but at night he's got that cell all to himself.

1589
01:47:32,709 --> 01:47:34,167
Oh, Lord.

1590
01:47:34,252 --> 01:47:36,294
What?

1591
01:47:37,964 --> 01:47:40,298
Andy come down to the loading dock today.

1592
01:47:40,383 --> 01:47:43,885
- He asked me for a length of rope.
- Rope?

1593
01:47:43,970 --> 01:47:45,804
Six feet long.

1594
01:47:45,888 --> 01:47:47,347
And you gave it to him?

1595
01:47:47,432 --> 01:47:50,100
Sure I did. Why wouldn't I?

1596
01:47:50,101 --> 01:47:51,810
Jesus, Heywood.

1597
01:47:51,894 --> 01:47:54,146
Hey, how the hell was I supposed to know?

1598
01:47:54,230 --> 01:47:56,148
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1599
01:47:56,232 --> 01:47:57,274
No.

1600
01:47:58,317 --> 01:48:00,527
Andy would never do that.

1601
01:48:00,528 --> 01:48:02,612
Never.

1602
01:48:03,656 --> 01:48:05,741
I don't know.

1603
01:48:07,785 --> 01:48:09,870
Every man has his breaking point.

1604
01:48:12,498 --> 01:48:13,749
Lickety-split.

1605
01:48:13,833 --> 01:48:16,710
- I want to get home.
- Just about finished, sir.

1606
01:48:32,810 --> 01:48:34,895
Three deposits tonight.

1607
01:48:43,279 --> 01:48:45,363
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1608
01:48:45,364 --> 01:48:48,825
And shine my shoes.
I want 'em looking like mirrors.

1609
01:48:48,910 --> 01:48:50,285
Yes, sir.

1610
01:48:55,583 --> 01:48:57,250
It's good having you back, Andy.

1611
01:48:57,335 --> 01:49:00,087
The place wasn't the same without you.

- Dufresne.

1627
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:12,719
Get your ass out here, boy.
You're holding up the show.

1628
01:51:15,223 --> 01:51:19,267
Don't make me come down there.
I'll thump your skull for you.

1629
01:51:26,859 --> 01:51:30,237
Damn it, Dufresne, you're putting me behind!
I got a schedule to keep.

1630

You'd better be sick or dead in there,
I shit you not!

01:52:03,479 --> 01:52:05,689
- Start with that friend of his.
- Who?

1636
01:52:05,773 --> 01:52:06,982
Him!

1637
01:52:08,901 --> 01:52:10,986
Open 237.

1638
01:52:13,990 --> 01:52:16,116
What do you mean, he just wasn't here?

1639
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:17,742
Don't say that to me, Haig.

1640
01:52:17,827 --> 01:52:20,078
Don't say that to me again.

1641
01:52:20,162 --> 01:52:21,246
But, sir, he wasn't.

1642
01:52:21,330 --> 01:52:23,498
I can see that, Haig!

1643
01:52:23,582 --> 01:52:25,375
You think I'm blind?

1644
01:52:25,376 --> 01:52:28,503
Is that what you're saying? Am I blind, Haig?

1645
01:52:28,587 --> 01:52:29,587
No, sir.

1646
01:52:29,672 --> 01:52:31,715
What about you?

1647
01:52:31,799 --> 01:52:33,633
Are you blind?

1648
01:52:33,718 --> 01:52:36,261
- Tell me what this is.
- Last night's count.

1649
01:52:36,345 --> 01:52:39,639
You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. See? Right there.

1650
01:52:39,724 --> 01:52:41,599
Dufresne.

1651
01:52:42,852 --> 01:52:44,519
He was in his cell at lights out.

1652
01:52:44,603 --> 01:52:47,814
It stands to reason
he'd still be here in the morning.

1653
01:52:48,899 --> 01:52:50,775
I want him found.

1654
01:52:50,860 --> 01:52:53,445
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast.

1655
01:52:53,529 --> 01:52:54,571
Now!

1656
01:52:54,572 --> 01:52:56,072
Yes, sir!

1657
01:52:57,199 --> 01:52:59,784
Let's go, let's go!
Move your butts! Move it!

1658
01:53:02,621 --> 01:53:03,663
Stand.

1659
01:53:04,790 --> 01:53:06,041
Well?

1660
01:53:09,420 --> 01:53:10,545
Well, what?

1661
01:53:10,629 --> 01:53:14,090
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

1662
01:53:15,134 --> 01:53:16,760
He must have said something.

1663
01:53:16,844 --> 01:53:18,887
No, sir, Warden.

1664
01:53:18,971 --> 01:53:20,430
Not a word.

1665
01:53:22,433 --> 01:53:24,434
Lord, it's a miracle!

1666
01:53:25,478 --> 01:53:27,937
A man up and vanished like a fart in the wind.

1667
01:53:28,022 --> 01:53:29,773
Nothing left but...

1668
01:53:29,857 --> 01:53:32,776
some damn rocks on a windowsill.

1669
01:53:32,860 --> 01:53:34,611
And that cupcake on the wall.

1670
01:53:34,695 --> 01:53:36,321
Let's ask her.

1671
01:53:36,405 --> 01:53:40,367
Maybe she knows. What say there,
Fuzzy Britches? Feel like talking?

1672
01:53:41,452 --> 01:53:42,535
Ah...

1673
01:53:42,536 --> 01:53:43,995
I guess not.

1674
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:46,956
Why should she be any different?

1675
01:53:47,041 --> 01:53:49,501
This is a conspiracy.

1676
01:53:49,585 --> 01:53:51,795
That's what this is.

1677
01:53:51,879 --> 01:53:53,421
One big...

1678
01:53:53,506 --> 01:53:56,257
damn conspiracy!

1679
01:53:56,342 --> 01:53:59,010

Here you go, miss.

Rest room break, boss?

1832
02:09:44,664 --> 02:09:48,959
You don't need to ask me every time you need
to go take a piss. Just go. Understand?

1833
02:09:50,170 --> 02:09:51,837
Yes, sir.

<i>No way I'm gonna make it on the outside.</i>

<i>I could use a good man</i>

<i>Parole violation.</i>
