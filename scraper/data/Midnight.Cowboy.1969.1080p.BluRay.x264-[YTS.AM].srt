157
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,463
Do it for Mama.

158
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,343
Hey, you little old dog.
How you doin' there, scutter?

159
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,388
They got you all gussied up
for some damn thing, ain't they?

160
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,598
Uh, pardon me, ma'am.

161
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,846
Uh, I'm brand-spankin'- new
in this here town,

162
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,474
and I was hopin' to get a look
at the Statue of Liberty.

163
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,398
- Hopin' to get a look at what?
- Uh, Statue of Liberty.

164
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:15,061
It's up in Central Park taking a leak.

165
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,521
If you'll hurry up,
you'll catch the supper show.

166
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,996
He's picking something up for me.

167
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,667
Hi. I just got your message.

168
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,752
- How do you feel?
<i>- Don't ask.</i>

169
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,883
Oh, I had such a head.
I loved your friend Mr. Needleman.

170
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,260
- The last of the great King Midases.
<i>- You ain't kiddin', baby.</i>

171
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,094
Go, go, go. My God, I was exhausted.

172
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,645
It was beautiful, Maury, but...
Oh, God! Stop!

173
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,974
- I'd die from that!
<i>- Who's there? Who you talkin' to?</i>

174
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:56,355
No, I was just talkin' to Baby.

175
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,027
<i>Baby? What baby?</i>

176
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:01,027
- I was talking to the dog, Maury!
<i>- Thatgoddamn dog.</i>

177
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,359
Please. You're annoying me.
Don't start up again.

178
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,114
<i>- I'm annoying</i> you?
- Here, look.

179
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,446
Why don't you say hello to Baby, huh?

180
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,953
Baby wants to say hello to you, Daddy.

181
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,785
<i>I don't wanna say hello to the dog, but...
Oh, sh... Christ.</i>

182
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,369
<i>- Cass!</i>
- Go ahead.

183
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,298
- Daddy wants to say hello to you, Baby.
<i>- Hello, Baby. Hello, Baby.</i>

184
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,171
<i>Hello, you goddamn dog.</i>

185
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,674
<i>Bow-wow-wow, Baby. Bow-wow-wow.</i>

186
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,597
- Am I gonna see you tonight?
<i>- Where do you wanna eat?</i>

187
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,140
Wherever you say.

188
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,809
<i>- Just you and me. No Needleman.</i>
- Hey, that's great.

189
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,262
<i>- Catch an early supper at Lindy's.</i>
- What time?

190
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,599
<i>Like 5:30. We don't have to rush.</i>

191
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,605
<i>My wife's away. Her mother's sick.</i>

192
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:38,936
Beautiful, baby.

193
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,941
I can stay all night, Cass.

194
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,863
<i>How 'bout a little kiss?</i>

195
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,861
You got it.

196
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,910
A big wet one till I see ya.

197
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,872
<i>Hey!
Hey, hold it, baby.</i>

198
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,996
<i>Save some of that for tonight, okay?</i>

199
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,452
<i>- Love you.</i>
- Love you.

200
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:58,664
<i>Love you, Cass.</i>

201
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:17,683
<i>Welcome to</i> State Lines,
<i>the new telephone pun game.</i>

202
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,939
<i>In our isolation booths...</i>

203
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,395
<i>Is it because I'm a stable hand?</i>

204
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,822
<i>One, two. One, two.</i>

205
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,615
<i>- And rest. How you feeling?
- Oh, wow!</i>

206
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,158
<i>Do you think God is dead?</i>

207
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,202
<i>Suppose we just don't
talk about it anymore.</i>

208
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,999
<i>One...</i>

209
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,328
<i>What would you say
if I wanted to take my mother along?</i>

210
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,207
Oh, my God!

211
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,129
<i>It even makes black whiter.</i>

212
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,458
<i>- Bring your knees up.
- Come on out. And they're...</i>

213
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,213
<i>Ho-ho-ho!</i>

214
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,343
Whoo-hoo!

215
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,728
Hey, Cass. You know what you got here?

216
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,274
You got yourself a damn penthouse.

217
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,317
Real damn penthouse, Cass.

218
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,021
Don't look, baby.

219
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,070
Mmm!

220
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,823
Knock off a couple of pounds here and there
and I'd really be a gorgeous chick.

221
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:11,949
Right, Baby?

222
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,247
Ugh! Don't touch, for God sakes.
I'm late already.

223
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,074
What time is it?

224
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,704
Oh, my God!

225
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,916
Straighten out the bed for me, will ya, Tex.

226
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,419
Say, Cass.

227
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,006
I sure have enjoyed bein' here.

228
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:31,423
I believe it's as fine a time
as I've ever had in my damn life.

229
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,928
Me too, lover.

230
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,930
Well, that's good. It is, 'cause, uh...

231
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,808
Well, hell, the way you make me
feel so damn at home here,

232
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,140
I almost hate to bring up business.

233
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:43,352
Yeah, it's murder, isn't it?
What line are you in, sweetie?

234
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,357
Zip me up, will ya, Tex?

235
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:48,440
Maury's always
complaining about his ulcers.

236
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:51,326
Yeah, well, I don't know
what line Maury's in,

237
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:55,577
but, uh, myself, now,
I'm, uh, kinda a hustler.

238
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,373
Well, a person's gotta make a living.

239
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:59,538
Uh, pardon me, ma'am?

240
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,666
I said, "A person's gotta make a living."

241
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,007
Are you sure you heard what I said?

242
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,130
Sorry, Tex. My mind isn't all here.

243
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,303
I don't wanna be late
for my date with Maury.

244
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,803
Listen, sweetie, why don't you
run along and, um, take the number.

245
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,931
And we're gonna get in touch
with each other real soon. Aren't we?

246
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:19,604
Would you believe that?

247
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,057
I forgot to get to the bank,
and now it's too late.

248
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:25,235
Listen, I have to take a taxi.
I need a few bucks.

249
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:28,439
I hate to ask you, but you're such a doll.

250
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:33,156
You know, Cass, that's a funny thing,
you mentioning money,

251
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,329
'cause I was just about to ask <i>you</i> for some.

252
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,783
You were gonna ask me for money? Huh?

253
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:43,086
Well, hell, why do you think I come
all the way up here from Texas for?

254
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,755
You were gonna ask me for money.

255
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,962
Who the hell do you think
you're dealing with?

256
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,841
Some old slut on 42nd Street?

257
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,639
In case you didn't happen to notice it,

258
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,887
you big Texas longhorn bull,

259
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,889
I'm one hell of a gorgeous chick!

260
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,687
- Well, now, Cass, take it easy now.
- You heard it. At 28 years old.

261
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:05,063
You think you can come up here
and pull this kind of crap up here?

262
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,690
- Well, you're out of your mind!
- Cass, now, come on now.

263
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,148
I could kill you with my bare hands!
Will ya get outta here!

264
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:14,325
Will you get outta here!

265
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:17,112
Oh, Cass, honey.

266
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,948
Cass, come on now.

267
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,036
Cass... Hey, Cass. You think I meant that?

268
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:29,045
Would I be after you for money
with a wad like I've got ridin' on my hip?

269
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,047
Now, come on. You stop your cryin'.
You are one gorgeous chick.

270
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,596
Guy gets horny just lookin' at you.
How much you want for that damn taxi?

271
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:37,675
How much you want now? Five?

272
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,969
Ten? You want ten?

273
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,644
Twenty?

274
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,144
There you go, girl.

275
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,389
Terrific shirt.

276
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:30,561
- Are you speakin' to me?
- I was just admiring that colossal shirt.

277
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,771
I mean, that is one hell of a shirt.

278
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,152
I'll bet you paid a pretty price for it.
Am I right?

279
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,655
- Oh, I ain't cheap.
- Yeah. Birds.

280
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:40,988
- I say it's an all-right shirt.
- I like birds.

281
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:44,620
I don't like to have a lot of, you know,
cheap stuff on my back.

282
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,622
- Sure.
- Hi, cowboy.

283
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:47,953
Got a cigarette?

284
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:50,418
Hey, sweetheart.

285
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,300
More goddamn faggots in this town.

286
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,594
- Oh, kiss it, Ratso!
- Up yours.

287
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,093
You gotta watch out for that.

288
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:03,348
Hey, you really know the ropes.
Damn. I wish I'd bumped into you before.

289
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,305
I'm Joe Buck from Texas.

290
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,140
Enrico Rizzo, from the Bronx.

291
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,897
And I'm gonna buy you a drink.
What the hell you think of that?

292
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:15,025
- Don't mind if I do.
- Bartender, drinks all around.

293
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,947
And one for my friend here too.

294
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:20,823
I know when I give satisfaction.
I give her satisfaction.

295
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,496
I mean, you see what I'm getting at here?

296
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,665
She's got a penthouse up there

297
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:28,960
with a color TV and more goddamn diamonds
than an archbishop.

298
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,379
And she busts out bawlin'
when I ask her for money.

299
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,752
- For what?
- For money.

300
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,799
Wait a minute. Money for what?

301
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,296
Well, hell, I'm a hustler.
You didn't know that?

302
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:43,551
How am I supposed to know that?
You gotta tell a person these things.

303
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:45,556
- I'm a hustler.
- Shh.

304
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,937
All right. You're a hustler.

305
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,565
But, I mean, your pickin' up trade
on the street like that, that's nowhere.

306
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:57,272
I mean, you gotta get yourself
some kind of management.

307
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:00,279
I think you put your finger on it.

308
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,361
You know what you need?

309
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,411
You need my friend O'Daniel.

310
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,706
He operates the biggest stable in town.

311
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,284
In fact, in the whole
goddamn metropolitan area.

312
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,290
It's stupid, a stud like you paying.

313
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,588
You don't wanna be stupid.
I mean, I understand.

314
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:16,257
A dame starts cryin',
I'd cut my heart out for her.

315
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,177
I'd call that a very minor operation.

316
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:21,676
In fact, you just sit comfy

317
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,849
and I'll cut it out
with my fingernail file, Ratso.

318
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:25,800
The name's Rizzo.

319
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,851
That's what I said. Ratso.

320
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:30,476
- Hey. You heard him.
- That's all right, Joe.

321
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,024
I mean, you know, I'm used to these types

322
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,067
that get their kicks pickin' on cripples.

323
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:38,113
- The sewer's full of them.
- I wanna ask you one question, cowboy.

324
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,859
If you're sitting over here,
and he's sitting all the way over there,

325
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,944
then how's he gonna get his hand
into your pocket?

326
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:48,031
- Well, suppose you let me work...
- Oh, but I guess he's got that all figured out.

327
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,707
Good night, sweets.

328
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:51,705
Faggot.

329
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,286
- Provolone.
- Faggot.

330
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,043
Look, with these gals that wanna buy it,

331
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,671
most of them are old and dignified.

332
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,127
Social register types.
You know what I mean?

333
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,885
They can't be trottin' down to Times Square
to pick out the merchandise.

334
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:07,718
They gotta have some kind of a middleman.

335
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,554
That's where O'Daniel comes in.
You know what I mean?

336
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,731
Hey, I'm walkin' here!

337
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,809
I'm walkin' here!

338
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,519
- Up yours, you son of a bitch!
- Get out of the way!

339
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,696
You don't talk to me that way!
Get outta here!

340
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,368
Don't worry about that.

341
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:28,197
Actually, that ain't a bad way
to pick up insurance.

342
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:33,251
It's crazy, a stud like you paying that
dame that you told me about double sawbucks.

343
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,044
You know, with proper management,

344
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,669
you could be takin' home $50,
maybe $100 a day, easy.

345
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:41,672
Hey, Brucie. Hang in there, baby.

346
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,465
What's that?

347
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,594
Him I placed with O'Daniel
about two weeks ago.

348
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,017
He ain't much of a stud either,
from what I hear.

349
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,236
All right, all right.

350
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:01,563
Hey, horse.

351
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,400
How about you take me to meet
this Mr. O'Diddleburg right now?

352
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,110
- What do you say about that?
- Well, Joe, you're a nice guy.

353
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:10,868
And I'd be doin' both of youse a favor.
But, you know, for what?

354
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:14,292
What am I draggin' my bum leg
around town for, you know?

355
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:18,463
Tomorrow, some peach like that is liable to be
scratching your back over there at the Plaza.

356
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,540
And where am I gonna be, you know? Where?

357
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:24,753
H-Hold on. Hold it right there.
You think I'm that kind of a son of a bitch?

358
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,758
Well, you just name your cut.

359
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,306
Whatever you want, you got it right now.
I swear.

360
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:30,554
It's all right.

361
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,556
What you want? Five? Ten?

362
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:36,139
What, are you kidding me?
You know what? I'd "ax" somebody else.

363
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:39,647
- There's ten right there.
- All right, all right. Forget it.

364
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,477
I'll take the ten.

365
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,813
But when I take you over
to see Mr. O'Daniel,

366
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:47,275
I'm gonna have to have another ten
just to cover expenses. All right?

367
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:48,655
- Uh...
- Come on.

368
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,032
I'll buy youse coffee. On me.

369
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:55,749
Get outta here. Come on.
Bunch of creeps. Go to work.

370
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,339
He needs you right now. Tonight.

371
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,542
I got his tongue hangin' out.

372
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,673
He... His name is Joe Buck.
He's a cowboy.

373
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,801
He just, uh... Just came in from Texas.
He, uh... Very new to the city.

374
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,427
He don't quite know the ropes.

375
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,477
But he's very promising material, sir,
if you know what I mean.

376
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,563
<i>Fabulous. Right away.</i>

377
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,437
<i>What's your, uh, room
number there again, sir?</i>

378
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:22,443
<i>Right. Okay.</i>

379
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:30,194
901. You got it?
Hey, hold it a second, will ya?

380
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,196
Let's see how you look.

381
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,782
Fine. Fine.

382
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:37,287
You look fine.

383
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,336
Uh, think I could have that other ten now?

384
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:43,373
Where can I reach you?

385
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:46,084
'Cause I'm gon' make this thing right
with you soon as I get me set up.

386
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,636
- Forget it.
- I mean it, damn it. Where do you live?

387
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:50,884
Uh, it's the Sherry-Netherlands Hotel.

388
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,432
Chevy-Netherlands Hotel.
Chevy-Netherlands Hotel.

389
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,386
Hurry up now. Get your ass in there.
He's waitin'. Go ahead.

390
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,346
Come on. What, are you on vacation?

391
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,899
Don't close the doors on me.
What's the matter with you?

392
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,829
You must be Joe Buck.

393
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,578
Yes, sir, I am.

394
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,659
Come on in. Let's take a look at you.

395
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,382
Turn round. Turn round.

396
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,641
Good, strong back.
You're gonna need it.

397
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:38,178
Yeah.

398
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:40,684
So you want help, eh?

399
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:42,936
Yeah. Sit down, sit down. Relax.

400
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,268
Yeah.

401
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:50,985
Cowboy, eh?

402
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:55,946
Uh, w-well, sir, I... I
ain't a for-real cowboy.

403
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,998
But I am one hell of a stud!

404
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,541
Take it easy, boy.

405
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:06,252
Seems to me you're different
from most of the boys that come to me.

406
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,300
Most of those boys
are troubled and confused.

407
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,467
I'd say you know exactly what you want.

408
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,799
- You bet I do, sir.
- Yeah.

409
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:21,851
But I'll bet you got one thing in common
with those other boys.

410
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,603
I'll bet you're lonesome.

411
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,065
Well, not too.

412
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:31,773
I mean, a little.

413
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,779
Yeah.

414
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,656
Lonesome!

415
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:39,744
"I'm lonesome, so I'm a drunk."

416
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:42,576
- "I'm lonesome, so I'm a dope fiend."
- Oh, shut up!

417
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,661
"I'm lonesome, so I'm a thief."

418
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:47,121
"I'm lonesome, so I'm a fornicator!"

419
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,831
- "A whoremonger!"
- Shut up, you phony!

420
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,712
Poop, I say! Poop!

421
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,384
I've heard it all.

422
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,555
I've heard it all, and I'm sick of it.
Sick to death of it!

423
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,257
- Yes, sir, I can see that.
- Lonesomeness.

424
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:02,436
Lonesomeness is something
you take, you hear?

425
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:05,265
Damn it, you take it
and you go right on with your work.

426
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,226
- I'm rarin' to go, sir.
- Yes, I believe you are.

427
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,274
- Cowboy, eh?
- Yes, sir.

428
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,731
Yeah. Ready for some hard work, son?

429
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,691
- I'm ready for anything.
- Yeah.

430
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:19,699
I reckon it's gonna be a lot easier
for you, Joe Buck, than for most others.

431
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:23,078
- It's gonna be like money from home, sir.
- Money from home!

432
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,535
There's your strength, son. See?

433
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:29,168
You've got the way of putting things earthy
so that anybody can understand them.

434
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,709
I warn you, Joe Buck. I'm gonna use you.

435
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:35,378
I'm gonna run you ragged!

436
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,930
Whoo-hah!

437
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,225
You're wonderful, boy.
You and me, we're gonna have fun together.

438
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:44,224
- It don't have to be joyless.
- Hell, no, it don't have to be.

439
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:47,857
Say, why don't you and me

440
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:50,936
get right down on our knees right now?

441
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,320
How's that strike you?

442
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,319
- Where?
- Right here!

443
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:57,866
Here! Here!

444
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,239
Right now!

445
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,992
Why not? Why not?

446
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:05,701
I've prayed on the streets.
I've prayed in the saloons.

447
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:07,410
I've prayed in the toilets.

448
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:10,963
It don't matter where,
so long as he gets that prayer!

449
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,086
Shit!

450
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,168
Aah! That's the ticket, boy!

451
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:17,299
Just open your heart a little more!

452
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:20,097
What's the matter,
as long as you get that love...

453
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,049
Don't be frightened, son!

454
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:25,386
I baptize thee, my brother,
in the name of the Father...

455
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,312
And you shall be heard!

456
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,608
- <i>the Son and the Holy Spirit.
- Don't be frightened, son!</i>

457
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:34,153
<i>No! Don't run from Jesus!</i>

458
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:37,251
Hey. You know that runty little bastard
I was with?

459
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,710
No, I don't know nothing, man.

460
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,930
Stop it!

461
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,139
Stop it! Stop it, stop it, stop it!

462
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:06,070
<i>Now, what's that monstrosity down there?</i>

463
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,746
<i>That's a toupee for dogs.</i>

464
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,994
<i>- For dogs?
- This is Fifi's wig.</i>

465
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,418
That... That's for that dog?

466
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,881
<i>I don't believe this dog.
There's something going on here.</i>

467
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,583
<i>There's something going on here.</i>

468
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,465
<i>Now, really, seriously,</i>

469
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:26,140
<i>isn't this really a case of conning
a lot of lonely people?</i>

470
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:28,434
<i>Well, lonely people, yes.
Who else would do it?</i>

471
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,512
<i>A woman with a lot of children
wouldn't have time.</i>

472
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,564
<i>When they have no children,
a woman who is alone...</i>

473
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,607
There's a TV dinner in the fridge, lover boy.

474
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,607
Expect me when you see me.
I'll leave you movie money.

475
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:45,448
<i>I think that's sick.
Dressing up a dog to look like a child?</i>

476
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:50,994
- <i>This is in case she meets another...
- Oh, no! That's terrible!</i>

477
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:52,416
<i>That's terrible!</i>

478
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,587
<i>Trying to hold this...</i>

479
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:27,819
<i>Gold and silver and candlelight.</i>

480
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,245
<i>Wine and skyrockets</i>

481
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:33,699
<i>and butterfly thoughts
that glitter in your mind.</i>

482
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:37,620
<i>You're special.</i>

483
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:39,922
<i>Give yourselfspecial treatment.</i>

484
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,801
<i>Need money? We'd love to lend it to you.</i>

485
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:48,055
<i>Why worry about your future?</i>

486
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:51,509
<i>What do you want
more than anything in the world?</i>

487
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,640
<i>Take it easy, but take it.</i>

488
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,355
Key to room 514, please, sir.

489
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,702
Looks like, uh, you've been
locked out of your room, buddy.

490
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:21,164
- Till you pick up the tab.
- Well, what about all my things and all?

491
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:25,627
Oh, we keep them nice and safe
till you get this thing settled.

492
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,382
Listen, I'll tell you what.

493
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:30,931
You can keep all the rest of the goddamn junk
if you just let me have the suitcase.

494
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,633
Suitcase means a lot to me.

495
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,969
We keep everything. House rules.

496
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:39,639
I spilled some on my pants.

497
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,776
Can you tell me
how I get to Grand Central?

498
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,777
Surely. You follow the green lights.

499
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:58,488
Uh, Officer.
How do I get to Grand Central?

500
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:11,338
You know what you gotta do, cowboy?

501
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:53,000
<i>Spacecraft to Earth Control.

<i>You have 30 seconds

506
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:14,404
<i>Only 30 seconds. Do you read me?</i>

507
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,947
<i>Spacecraft to Earth Control. I read you.</i>

508
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,420
<i>Chuck! Chuck! I've lost you!</i>

509

<i>Spacecraft to Earth Control.</i>

510

<i>We've lost contact with Captain Grace.</i>

511
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:45,595
<i>- Can you track him?
- Kiss me, Joe. Kiss me.</i>

<i>You're the only one, Joe.
You're the only one.</i>

515
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:03,742
<i>Listen, kissin' Crazy Annie,
man, you better drink a whole damn drugstore.</i>

516
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:11,003
<i>Kiss me, Joe. Kiss me.</i>

517
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:20,095
Oh! You're the only one, Joe!

518
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:33,521
I'm awful damn sorry you're sick.

519
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:37,905
But you're gonna have to give me that money,
like you said.

520
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:43,239
I was lying. I don't have it.

521
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,366
What are you gonna do to me?

522
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:48,415
- You ain't got no $25 on you?
- No.

523
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:51,710
What are you gonna do to me?

524
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:54,209
Well, what in the hell do you think
I'm gonna do?

525
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:57,006
What do you want me to do with you, boy?
You want me to beat on you?

526
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:58,925
- Is that what you want?
- No. No. No.

527
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,968
- How much you got in your pockets?
- Nothing.

528
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,798
You're gonna empty your pockets out
right over there.

529
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,262
- Take my books.
- I don't want your damn books!

530
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,847
- How much is that thing worth?
- No. No.

531
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:14,854
Don't... Don't take my watch. Please.

532
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:18,483
Don't take it. Don't take it.
It's only a cheap watch. I...

533
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:21,657
It's not worth anything.
I can't go home without it either. Please.

534
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,610
My mother would die. Don't take it.

535
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:27,117
I can't go home. She'd die.

536
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:31,412
She would die. Please.

537
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,374
I don't want your damn watch.

568
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:29,986
I tried to get in touch with you when I
heard, but I was laid up with this cold.

569
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:37,417
Hey, you want some free medical advice?

570
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:40,166
You just keep your damn mouth shut

00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:41,463
Right. Fine. Okay.

572
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:44,508
Fine. Okay. Another subject.

573

You still at the hotel?

- You keep away from me! You hear?

577
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:03,186
You come near me again,
I'm gonna snatch you bald-headed, boy.

578
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:06,772
I'm invitin' you.
If you're not located, I got a place.

579
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:11,159
- I'm invitin' you, goddamn it!
- You're inviting. Shit!

580
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:16,369
The "X" on the windows
means the landlord can't collect rent,

581
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:18,826
which is a convenience
on account of it's condemned.

582
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:25,044
Front door. I don't care.
Actually, I prefer it that way.

583

Got my own private entrance here.

585
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:38,395
You're the only one who knows about it.

586
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:45,481
Watch the plank, watch the plank.
You'll break your goddamn skull.

587
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,483
No way to collect insurance.

588
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,274
Okay, okay, okay.

589
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:56,238
Oh, there's glass there.

590
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:01,034
Oh, I've been meaning to take that fridge up.

591
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,539
Get it, will you?

592
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:07,295
- Need any help?
- No, I don't need no help from you.

593
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:10,719
You okay?

594
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:13,217
It's not far.

595
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,516
It's just one more up.

596
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,516
All the electric's off.
I don't mess with Con Edison.

597
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,438
Just another convenience, huh?

598
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:25,438
But the icebox will keep the roaches
from gettin' in the perishables.

599
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:27,986
Where did you steal this damn thing?

600
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:30,780
What do you mean, steal it?
It's been sittin' down there for weeks.

601
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:34,530
- I don't mean now. I mean before then.
- Don't get a hernia. You know what I mean?

602
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,869
Go ahead. Just drop it anywhere.

603
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,845
Not, uh... Not bad, huh?

604
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:06,392
There's no heat here, but, uh, you know,

605
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:09,694
by the time winter comes,
uh, I'll be in Florida.

606
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:12,398
Hey, uh, do you want to stretch out here?

607
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,652
Make yourself comfortable?

608
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:23,533
Okay...

609
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:28,335
Go ahead.
Why don't you take a... take a nap?

610
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:44,646
Would you like a cup of coffee?

611
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:14,342
Joe? Do you love me, Joe?

612
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:25,262
You're the only one, Joe.
You're the only one.

613
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,077
<i>Charlie, don't you think she's pretty?</i>

614
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:51,625
<i>Charlie, don't you think she's pretty?</i>

615
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:52,796
<i>Charlie...</i>

616
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,169
<i>Charlie, do you hear me?</i>

617
00:50:57,263 --> 00:51:00,677
<i>I said stop that!</i>

618
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:12,605
He's the one. He's the only one.

619
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:25,993
<i>He's the one.</i>

620
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,166
<i>He's the only one.</i>

621
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:46,601
<i>Casualty reports have been issued.</i>

622
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:50,647
<i>The American information officer says
there have been 429 American casualties.</i>

623
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:52,725
<i>429 on the death list.</i>

624
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:56,482
<i>This as opposed to 643
South Vietnamese soldiers on the death list.</i>

625
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:58,359
Wait a minute. Hey, what...

626
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:59,906
What's the mat...

627
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:01,654
What's the matter?

628
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:05,787
Where's my boots? Where's my damn boots?

629
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,082
Over there.

630
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,126
How'd they get off me?

631
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,128
I took 'em off.

632
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,344
Wh-What for?

633
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:24,969
What do you mean, what for?
So you could sleep. I mean, Christ.

634
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:31,646
Smart thing for me to do is
haul my ass outta here.

635
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:34,686
What's the matter now?

636
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:39,028
Well, y-you want me to stay here.
You're after somethin'. What you after?

637
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:46,369
- You don't look like no fag.
- What's that supposed to mean?

638
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:50,323
Want me to stay here tonight.
That's the idea, ain't it?

639
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:53,376
Look, I'm not forcing you.
I mean, who's forcing you?

640
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:57,422
Oh, I'm sorry. I truly am.
I must've got the wrong impression then.

641
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,593
Okay. Okay, boy.

642
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:08,429
Look, I want you to stay, all right?

643
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:10,511
I goddamn invited you, didn't I?

644
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:16,900
Well, I hope you know what you're in for.

645
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:19,477
I'm a truly dangerous person. I am.

646
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,938
If someone does me bad like you...

647
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:25,321
If I'd have caught you that night, there
would've been one dead Ratso long about now.

648
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:27,152
You understand me?

649
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,699
You hear?

650
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,201
I'm impressed. You're a killer.

651
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:38,497
So, if I'm gonna stay here a couple days,
I just thought you should know. That's all.

652
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,556
"Property of the YMCA."

653
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:55,855
Sometimes you make me wanna puke, Ratso.

654
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,692
Joe, uh, do me one favor, huh?

655
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:10,153
- This is my place. Am I wrong?
- No, you ain't wrong.

656
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:15,205
You know, in my own place,
my name ain't Ratso.

657
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:20,121
I mean, it just so happens
that in my own place, my name...

658
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:22,628
is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.

659
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,089
Well, hell, I can't say all that.

660
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,381
Rico, then.

661
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:33,093
At least call me Rico
in my own goddamn place.

662
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:35,554
Okay. Rico, Rico, Rico.

663
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:38,185
Rico, Rico, Rico, Rico.
Is that enough for you?

664
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,767
That's fine. Give me a pillow.

665
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:42,727
Come on. Give me one of those pillows.

666
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:53,492
Keep your meat hooks off my radio.

667
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:01,708
Rico, Rico.

668
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:20,974
Are you here again?

669
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:23,435
Didn't I tell you once before
to keep away from here?

670
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:25,566
- Easy, easy.
- Every time you take stuff from me!

671
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:28,148
- Will you get out of here!
- That ain't nice, pickin' on a crippled boy!

672
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:32,486
- Ah, cripple or not, I don't care!
- Who the hell do you think <i>you</i> are, goddamn it?

673
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:46,837
The two basic items
necessary to sustain life

674
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:50,091
are sunshine and coconut milk.

675
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:53,427
Did you know that?

676
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:55,224
That's a fact.

677
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,724
In Florida, you got a terrific
amount of coconut trees there.

678
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:02,478
In fact, I think they even got 'em
in the, uh, gas stations over there.

679
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:04,896
And ladies.

680
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:08,567
You know that in Miami you got, uh...

681
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:10,148
Are you listenin' to me?

682
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,534
You got more ladies in Miami

683
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,408
than in any resort area
in the country there.

684
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:21,209
I think per capita, on a given day,
there's probably 300 of 'em on the beach.

685
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,416
In fact, you can't even scratch yourself

686
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:27,374
without getting a belly button
up the old kazoo there.

687
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,174
It's hot. Let's go.

688
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:31,378
Come on!

689
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,225
Hey.

690
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:46,730
Smells worse hot than it did cold.

691
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:50,484
All right, startin' tomorrow,
you cook your own goddamn dinner.

692
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:53,362
Or you get one of your rich
Park Avenue ladies to cook for you.

693
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:55,660
- I'm eatin' it. I'm eatin' it, see?
- In her penthouse.

694
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:59,114
Look, I'm eatin' this shit, Ratso.
Mmm, good! Mmm.

695
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,173
- It's good.
- I gotta get outta here.

696
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:12,301
I gotta get outta here.

697
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,517
Miami Beach. That's where you could score.

698
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:29,944
Anybody can score there, even you.

699
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:35,943
In New York, no rich lady with any class
at all buys that cowboy crap anymore.

700
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:38,198
They're laughin' at you on the street.

701
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:41,197
Ain't nobody laughin' at me on the street.

702
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,159
Behind your back,
I seen 'em laughin' at you, fella.

703
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,164
Oh, what the hell do you know
about women anyway?

704
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:48,746
When's the last time you scored, boy?

705
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,923
That's a matter
I only talk about at confession.

706
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,217
We're not talkin' about me now.

707
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,465
Well, when was the last time
you been to confession?

708
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:58,548
That's between me and my confessor.
And I'll tell you another thing.

709
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:00,759
Frankly, you're beginning to smell.

710
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:03,223
And for a stud in New York,
that's a handicap.

711
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,054
Don't talk to me about clean.

712
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:08,641
I ain't never seen you change your underwear
once the whole time I've been here in New York.

713
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:11,694
- And that's pretty peculiar behavior.
- I don't have to do that kind of thing in public.

714
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,864
- I ain't got no need to expose myself.
- No, I'll bet you don't!

715
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:18,068
I bet you ain't never even been laid!
How 'bout that?

716
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,153
And <i>you're</i> gonna tell <i>me</i>
what appeals to women.

717
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:23,081
I know enough to know that
that great big dumb cowboy crap of yours

718
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:27,080
don't appeal to nobody
except every jacky on 42nd Street!

719
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:29,412
That's faggot stuff!

720
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:32,882
You wanna call it by its name,
that's strictly for fags.

721
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:37,629
John Wayne!
Are you gonna tell me he's a fag?

722
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:58,241
I like the way I look.
It makes me feel good. It does.

723
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,069
And women like me, goddamn it.

724
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:05,282
Hell, the only one thing
I've ever been good for is lovin'.

725
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,412
Women go crazy for me.
That's a really true fact.

726
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:10,085
Ratso, hell, Crazy Annie,
they had to send her away.

727
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:13,836
Then how come you ain't scored once
the whole time you've been in New York?

728
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:18,423
'Cause I need management, goddamn it!
'Cause you stole $20 off of me!

729
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:21,722
And that's why you're gonna stop
crappin' around about Florida

730
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:25,267
and get your skinny butt movin',
earn $20 worth of management,

731
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,969
which you owe me.

732
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:54,338
Signora...

733
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,916
A woman in your condition
shouldn't have to do all this.

734
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:02,047
Boy, you have a lot of laundry here.

735
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:15,643
<i>Well, it just ain't right,
cheatin' from a pregnant lady.</i>

736
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:18,445
- What did it cost her?
- What do you mean, what'd it cost her?

737
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:21,946
Get outta here. The laundry syndicate
lost a couple of coins. I'm cryin'.

738
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,651
- That's it, sir.
- All right.

739
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:26,658
That's good. Sir, where's mine?
The black homburg.

740
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:29,741
- I-I brought it in at the same time.
- Well, I tell you, I don't know.

741
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:33,579
You no have a hat here, mister.
You gotta bring me the ticket.

742
01:00:33,672 --> 01:00:36,039
What about that black homburg
right up there? Up in there.

743
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:37,840
Is that... Is that it right there?

744
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:41,673
- You want... A ticket? Here's my ticket.
- All right.

745
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:44,346
It's right there on the corner.
You wanna get it, right over there?

746
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:46,219
All right. I'll look 'em over.

747
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,551
Keep goin'. Up to the top.

748
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,307
Right in the corner there. The top one.

749
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:54,641
No, you know, it not belong
to yours. It belong somebody else.

750
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:55,724
Hey!

751
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:28,883
Hey, you're pretty damn good at that. I bet
you could make a livin' at it if you tried.

752
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:31,469
And end up a hunchback like my old man?

753
01:01:31,563 --> 01:01:34,931
If you think I'm crippled, you should've
caught him at the end of the day.

754
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:03,133
My old man spent 14 hours a day
down in that subway.

755
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:08,552
He'd come home at night, two, three dollars'
worth of change stained with shoe polish.

756
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:13,057
Stupid bastard coughed his lungs out
from breathin' in that wax all day.

757
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:18,311
Even the faggot undertaker
couldn't get his nails clean.

758
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,944
They had to bury him with gloves on.

759
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:26,566
Okay, go ahead. Come on. Take a look.

760
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:30,362
Don't rush me, boy.

761
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:32,447
Gotta take your time here.

762
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,957
Get myself primed up,

763
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:38,627
like I was turnin' on the charm
for some pretty little blonde lady, you know?

764
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:42,544
Then when I'm feeling cool and good,
I spin around.

765
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:47,628
And there you are, you handsome devil, you.

766
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:50,013
Not bad.

767
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,716
Not bad.

768
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,474
For a cowboy.

769
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,024
You're okay.

770
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,402
You're okay.

771
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,911
And you will be punctual, won't you?

772
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:15,206
The lady will meet you in the lobby.

773
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:20,495
Taxi!

774
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:29,132
Yes, sir. Oh, I think you got
somethin' on your shoulder there.

775
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:32,135
There, you got it. Go ahead. Go ahead.

776
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:36,219
Say, uh, you haven't got a quarter,
have you?

777
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:37,929
Just a quarter?

778
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,688
- How do you like that cheap bastard?
- Let's see what the hell you got here.

779
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:50,400
Listen, I think we struck gold.
This is one high-class chick.

780
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:53,827
"Barclay Hotel for Women."

781
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:55,905
<i>Women.</i>

782
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:59,829
Is this the Gentleman's Escort Service?

783
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:03,458
I'm calling for, uh, Miss Beecham, uh,

784
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,585
at the Barclay Hotel.

785
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:09,168
Right. Well, she changed her mind.
She won't need nobody tonight.

786
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:12,471
That's right. Thank you very much. Bye.

787
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:29,030
Would you believe a whole
goddamn hotel with nothin' but lonely ladies?

788
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,947
Score once in a setup like that,

789
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:33,742
and, Christ, the way they talk,
I could open up an office in there.

790
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:35,319
Come on.

791
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:41,033
Go ahead. Get the money.

792
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:44,537
Listen!

793
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:47,248
Get the cash.
Remember that lady in the penthouse.

794
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:49,880
Get the cash. Those rich ladies
write out a check at night,

795
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:52,086
and in the morning they call the bank
and stop payment.

796
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:54,923
Go ahead. Watch the car!

797
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:56,803
Go on.

798
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:08,037
Rico!

799
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,334
Hey, Rico!

800
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:13,463
Rico! Up here!

801
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:15,920
Up here! Rico!

802
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,401
B-6.

803
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:41,829
G-49.

804
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:44,828
G-49.

805
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:46,705
I-24.

806
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:48,627
I-24.

807
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:51,046
- And the next one is...
- Oh!

808
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:53,749
O-62, ladies and gentlemen.

809
01:06:54,886 --> 01:06:58,095
<i>O-62! Are there any bingos?</i>

810
01:06:58,181 --> 01:07:02,175
<i>- And the next one is B-13.</i>
- How dare you, in this public place!

811
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:05,852
Wait a second, lady!
Goddamn it, you keep your hands off me, sir.

812
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:24,473
<i>The temperature right now is 28 degrees,</i>

813
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:26,926
<i>and the weatherman says
it's going down tonight.</i>

814
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:30,934
<i>Very cloudy now, and we can expect
a few snow flurries later on.</i>

815
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,449
I'll give you five dollars for it.

816
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:38,872
Yeah.

817
01:11:43,758 --> 01:11:46,501
Oh, for Christ's sake!

818
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:09,773
Hey, Ratso.

819
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:15,658
Hey, get your ass out here.

820
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:17,740
I wanna show you something.

821
01:12:31,889 --> 01:12:34,597
There you go, boy. There's money for you.

822
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:38,560
That's nine dollars right there,
plus assorted change.

823
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,347
Minus 26 cents for milk.

824
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:45,480
Plus five cents for Dentyne. Gum.

825
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:52,858
Oh, tha-that's smart. Light a cigarette.

826
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:58,956
Why don't you take that and buy a carton,
do the job right?

827
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:01,617
Where'd you get it?

828
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:05,044
I got it.

829
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:10,042
Where you been? 42nd Street?

830
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:12,093
That's where you been.

831
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:16,594
- Movies, that's where you've been, ain't it?
- I ain't been nowhere.

832
01:13:16,684 --> 01:13:20,303
Yeah, movies. That's where
you got that thing on your back.

833
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:24,394
- What, this?
- "What, this?"

834
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:26,645
A friend I once did a favor for
give it to me.

835
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:28,022
- A friend!
- Yeah.

836
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:29,648
Who'd you ever do a favor for?

837
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:31,901
You just let some poor bastard
freeze to death, wouldn't you?

838
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:33,778
You stole the damn thing, didn't you?
You stole it.

839
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:37,489
I stoled it for you!

840
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:39,572
The goddamn thing's ten sizes
too big for me.

841
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:41,577
Wear it yourself.
I wouldn't have it on my back.

842
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:44,375
I'll be goddamned if I'll wear it.

843
01:13:44,462 --> 01:13:45,953
Here.

844
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:53,924
Oh, buy yourself some medicine
before you die on my damn hands.

845
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:34,759
- I hate boneyards.
- So split.

846
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:36,837
He ain't your goddamn father.

847
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:13,541
He was even dumber than you.

848
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:15,796
He couldn't even write his own name.

849
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:19,213
"X." That's what it oughta say
on that goddamn headstone.

850
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:20,922
One big lousy "X."

851
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:22,974
Just like our dump.

852
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,928
Condemned by order of city hall.

853
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:33,518
My grandma, Sally Buck...

854
01:15:34,989 --> 01:15:37,151
she died without lettin' me know.

855
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:52,789
Who are you, Hitler's storm troopers?

856
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:56,171
Just because I happened to get out of a car!
Would you believe that?

857
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:58,252
It all depends on what you believe in.

858
01:15:58,345 --> 01:16:03,340
You know, like sometimes your spirit
goes up, sometimes it goes...

859
01:16:03,434 --> 01:16:05,676
It goes, uh... It goes other places.

860
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:09,764
How long did I hold up traffic
just to get out? I ask you.

861
01:16:09,857 --> 01:16:14,067
Give some people a little power,
and they gotta supersede their authority.

862
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:17,772
This whole kind of thing is spiritual...
spiritual matters.

863
01:16:17,865 --> 01:16:20,903
Oh, now you're talkin' priest talk.
You're talkin' priest talk now.

864
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:23,736
I ain't talkin' priest talk.
I'm talkin' about what people believe in.

865
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:26,572
Some people believe
you can come back in another body.

866
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:30,701
Well, I hope I don't come back in your body.

867
01:16:30,795 --> 01:16:32,787
I ain't asking you to come back in my body.

868
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,712
I'm just saying
you can come back as anything.

869
01:16:34,799 --> 01:16:38,543
You could come back
as a... a dog or a president.

870
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:42,592
If I had my choice between a dog and a
president, I'd come back as a president.

871
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:45,344
I ain't that dumb. What do you think?

872
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:50,645
Maybe you've gotta think
about those things for a while.

873
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:55,024
I'm usually not like this. I'm usually
a very calm and collected person.

874
01:16:55,111 --> 01:16:57,398
Really, forgive me. I'm awfully sorry.

875
01:16:57,488 --> 01:16:59,855
I think I'm gonna write a letter
to the mayor.

876
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:06,244
I don't believe in any of that crap.
You're entitled to think what you want.

877
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:08,242
- Well, maybe I <i>do</i> think what I want.
- Him.

878
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:12,952
Maybe I <i>do</i> believe all that damn stuff,
and I... and I...

879
01:17:15,714 --> 01:17:17,876
- Do some thinkin' about it, that's all.
- Here.

880
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:25,051
What was that all about?

881
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:29,181
Hey, lookee here.
I've been chosen for some damn thing.

882
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:30,761
Hey.

883
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:33,980
- It's a come-on.
- Yeah, you know what this is?

884
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:36,399
This is a come-on to a party, is what it is.

885
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:38,977
It's a couple of wackos advertising.
Where does it say to go?

886
01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:40,812
Klein's Bargain Basement?

887
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:44,570
You go there and get a ten-year subscription
to the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica.</i>

888
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:49,246
It says "Broadway and Harmony Lane, Hansel
and Gretel McAlbertson. One flight up."

889
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:51,573
- That's perfectly clear, ain't it?
- Get outta here.

890
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:55,627
What do a couple of fruity wackos like that
want with characters like you and me?

891
01:17:55,713 --> 01:17:57,830
It don't say nothin' about you.

892
01:17:57,923 --> 01:18:00,040
Don't say nothin' about you.

893
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:04,336
- Don't say nothin' about you either.
- They took my picture, didn't they?

894
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,638
- Give me this thing.
- So what are you driving at?

895
01:18:06,724 --> 01:18:09,182
You want me to get lost
so you can go to your fancy-ass party?

896
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:11,760
Wait a minute. Wait a second.
I didn't say nothin' about that.

897
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:14,471
Did I say that? Did I?

898
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:20,144
I'll just tell 'em. "You want me,
I don't go nowhere without my buddy here."

899
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:26,866
I ain't dressed for a party.

900
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:40,379
There you go. Right here.

901
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:47,546
Hey, dog.

902
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:06,944
Hey, you all right?

903
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:09,993
You okay?

904
01:19:12,623 --> 01:19:15,912
Hell, damn,
you're sweating all over the damn place.

905
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:19,161
Come here.

906
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:32,925
You got a comb on you?

907
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:35,055
I don't need a comb.

908
01:19:35,145 --> 01:19:36,727
Here.

909
01:19:36,814 --> 01:19:39,682
Few dozen cooties ain't gonna kill me,
I don't guess.

910
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:49,149
- Okay?
- Yeah.

911
01:19:49,243 --> 01:19:51,075
- I look okay?
- Yeah.

912
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:56,623
Okay, come on. Come on.

913
01:20:04,383 --> 01:20:06,215
They're takin' my picture.

914
01:20:21,025 --> 01:20:23,517
Uh, now just one more close-up of her.

915
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:26,023
I love everything in the theater.

916
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:29,231
I would like to die on the stage.

917
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:31,483
And my hair is fur, you know.

918
01:20:31,577 --> 01:20:35,287
Its tendrils reaching out
into space sometimes.

919
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:37,864
I've watched it touch many stars.

920
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:39,824
Wackos. They're all wackos.

921
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:43,286
I think we better find somebody
and tell 'em that I'm here.

922
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:44,871
Hey!

923
01:20:45,883 --> 01:20:48,421
Uh, well, I made it.

924
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,968
This is my friend Ratso Rizzo and I.

925
01:20:51,055 --> 01:20:53,968
- Rico. Rico Rizzo.
- Hello.

926
01:20:54,058 --> 01:20:58,177
If you need anything, there's beer
and stuff behind me. Anything you want.

927
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:00,553
Oh, Jesus.

928
01:21:05,652 --> 01:21:07,735
If you want the word
on that brother-and-sister act,

929
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:11,030
Hansel's a fag, and Gretel's got the hots
for herself, so who cares, right?

930
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:12,948
Load up on the salami.

931
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:15,948
- It's like what?
- It's like heroin. Death is like heroin.

932
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:17,529
- It's nothing.
- Have you tried heroin?

933
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:20,331
Yeah, I've tried heroin.
It's like nothing. It's like death.

934
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:21,624
It's just nothing.

935
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:24,168
- Why are you here?
- I don't know.

936
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:25,836
Who brought you?

937
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:28,964
I don't know.

938
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:01,406
Hey, whoa.
Hey, sonny, what you doin' there?

939
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,412
She gave it to me, boy.

940
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:45,993
Hey, what do you want? Up or down?

941
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:48,586
Up or down?

942
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:50,664
Here, why don't you take an upper.

943
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:17,800
Why are you stealing food?

944
01:24:18,637 --> 01:24:21,380
I was just, uh, noticin'
that you're out of salami.

945
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:25,387
I think you oughta have somebody go over
to the delicatessen, bring some more back.

946
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:28,970
Well, you know, it's free.
You don't have to steal it.

947
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:31,476
If it's free, then I ain't stealin'.

948
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:34,184
<i>What's the matter?
How did you get crippled?</i>

949
01:24:34,278 --> 01:24:37,271
I slipped on a banana peel. Come on.
I gotta sit down. I feel crummy.

950
01:24:37,364 --> 01:24:39,481
- What's the matter with you?
- Take your hands off of me.

951
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:42,409
- Why don't you run up and use my shower.
- Why don't you take a walk.

952
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:44,827
Just take your hands off of me!
Don't touch me!

953
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:46,905
<i>- Just take a walk!
- Take a shave.</i>

954
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:49,992
- I'm just going to lick the sweat off.
- Keep your hands off of me!

955
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:51,701
Well, you look hot!

956
01:24:51,795 --> 01:24:54,333
- Guess who I am.
- Who?

957
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:56,710
It's me!

958
01:24:57,593 --> 01:25:00,506
How you doin'?
You're gettin' your picture took, huh?

959
01:25:16,028 --> 01:25:17,735
Hi.

960
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:08,198
Oh, no, no.

961
01:26:14,252 --> 01:26:15,743
Hey.

962
01:26:17,506 --> 01:26:19,338
Let's, uh...

963
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:23,334
leave now.

964
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:27,338
Your place...

965
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,091
or mine?

966
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:37,603
- She's hooked.
- Like why a cowboy?

967
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:39,935
I'd say she was good for ten bucks,
but I'll ask for 20.

968
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:42,020
Why a cowboy whore?

969
01:26:42,114 --> 01:26:43,855
Did you know we were gonna make it?

970
01:26:44,783 --> 01:26:47,526
So, uh, you really wanna do business?

971
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:49,451
Who is he?

972
01:26:51,081 --> 01:26:52,993
Don't tell me you two are a couple.

973
01:26:53,083 --> 01:26:55,291
Hey.

974
01:27:02,259 --> 01:27:04,125
Why are you laughing, Joe?

975
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:07,053
- Are you really a cowboy?
- Well, I'll tell you the truth now.

976
01:27:07,139 --> 01:27:10,598
I ain't a for-real cowboy,
but I am one hell of a stud.

977
01:27:10,684 --> 01:27:14,018
A very expensive stud,
and I happen to be his manager.

978
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:20,608
Incidentally,
how much is this gonna cost me?

979
01:27:20,694 --> 01:27:22,435
Twenty bucks.

980
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:24,899
- Okay.
- And taxi fare for me.

981
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:27,733
Oh, get lost, will ya?

982
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:31,365
I agree, but for that service
I charge one buck taxi fare.

983
01:27:33,457 --> 01:27:37,121
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

984
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:38,701
Oh, boy.

985
01:27:40,589 --> 01:27:42,080
Here.

986
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:46,505
- Go ahead.
- Give me a break.

987
01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:49,759
Listen, I don't even know what your name is.
I wanna know your name. What is it?

988
01:27:49,848 --> 01:27:52,386
- My name's Joe!
- Joe! Ah!

989
01:27:52,476 --> 01:27:54,263
Fabulous!

990
01:27:54,352 --> 01:27:57,095
Joe could be anyone. I like that.

991
01:27:57,189 --> 01:28:00,148
Move over, Joe. Come here, Joe.
Kiss me, Joe.

992
01:28:00,233 --> 01:28:02,691
That's a very good idea.
Why don't you kiss me, Joe?

993
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:10,362
Oh, my... Wow!

994
01:28:11,161 --> 01:28:12,493
Too much.

995
01:28:12,579 --> 01:28:14,070
He fell.

996
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:16,284
Hey, fella, you fell.

997
01:28:18,919 --> 01:28:20,455
Is he all right?

998
01:28:21,421 --> 01:28:23,333
Yeah, he's fine.

999
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:26,336
Well, if you're all right,
why you hangin' on the banister?

1000
01:28:26,426 --> 01:28:29,260
- Can't you walk or not?
- Naturally, I can walk.

1001
01:28:29,346 --> 01:28:31,838
Yeah. He's got taxi fare.

1002
01:28:31,932 --> 01:28:34,549
Come on.

1003
01:28:34,643 --> 01:28:37,511
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Yeah.

1004
01:28:37,604 --> 01:28:39,516
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1005
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:47,395
Hey, Ratso!

1006
01:28:47,489 --> 01:28:51,403
Whoopee-tee-yi-yo, boy! Whoo-hah!

1007
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:21,853
Well, it happens.

1008
01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:27,064
- Don't worry about it.
- It ain't never happened to me before.

1009
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:30,734
You bet your bottom dollar on that.

1010
01:29:31,658 --> 01:29:33,991
Where's the matches, ma'am?

1011
01:29:34,077 --> 01:29:36,069
Over there behind that thing.

1012
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:49,878
Maybe if you didn't call me "ma'am,"

1013
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:52,335
things might work out better.

1014
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:55,797
That's the first goddamn time
the thing ever quit on me.

1015
01:29:59,352 --> 01:30:00,968
That's a fact.

1016
01:30:02,731 --> 01:30:04,222
You think I'm lyin' to you?

1017
01:30:04,316 --> 01:30:06,808
No. No, I don't think you're lying.

1018
01:30:07,903 --> 01:30:09,895
I just had this funny image.

1019
01:30:11,281 --> 01:30:14,865
I had this image of a, um, policeman

1020
01:30:14,951 --> 01:30:16,533
without his stick

1021
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:19,328
and a, uh, bugler without his horn.

1022
01:30:20,373 --> 01:30:22,330
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1023
01:30:24,336 --> 01:30:26,202
Oh.

1024
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:29,538
Well, I think I'm making it worse.

1025
01:30:36,598 --> 01:30:39,306
Maybe we oughta take a little nap...

1026
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:43,769
and see what happens.

1027
01:30:43,855 --> 01:30:46,347
- I ain't sleepy.
- Oh.

1028
01:30:53,657 --> 01:30:55,614
I know.

1029
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:57,191
Scribbage.

1030
01:31:10,215 --> 01:31:12,002
Shit!

1031
01:31:21,643 --> 01:31:23,976
Now, look at this here. See?

1032
01:31:24,062 --> 01:31:26,395
There's an "E" in "money."

1033
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:28,063
I mean, if that's your word.

1034
01:31:28,858 --> 01:31:30,645
M-O-N-Y.

1035
01:31:30,735 --> 01:31:34,524
That's just exactly how you spell it
up there on that big building up there.

1036
01:31:34,614 --> 01:31:36,606
M-O-N-Y, money.

1037
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:41,777
"Y."

1038
01:31:41,871 --> 01:31:43,658
What in the hell starts with "Y"?

1039
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:49,126
Well, it can end in "Y"...

1040
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:55,125
like, uh, "say," "pay"...

1041
01:31:56,386 --> 01:31:58,048
"lay."

1042
01:31:58,763 --> 01:32:00,425
Hey, pay,

1043
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:02,840
lay.

1044
01:32:05,687 --> 01:32:07,519
Okay, cut it out now. That's enough.

1045
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:10,222
You're cheating.
Teasin' me so I can't think.

1046
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:16,354
"Gay" ends in "Y."

1047
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:17,734
Hmm?

1048
01:32:19,284 --> 01:32:21,492
Do you like that?

1049
01:32:21,578 --> 01:32:23,319
Cut that out.

1050
01:32:23,413 --> 01:32:25,325
Gay, fey.

1051
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:28,616
Is that your problem, baby?

1052
01:32:30,503 --> 01:32:32,916
I'm gonna show you my darn problem!

1053
01:33:34,109 --> 01:33:35,225
Ow!

1054
01:33:46,538 --> 01:33:48,575
I'm not.

1055
01:33:48,665 --> 01:33:50,782
I'm not exaggerating.

1056
01:33:52,293 --> 01:33:54,159
Listen, Marjorie.

1057
01:33:54,254 --> 01:33:57,543
You should try it.
It might be terrific for you.

1058
01:33:58,967 --> 01:34:01,084
Oh, for God's sake.

1059
01:34:01,177 --> 01:34:03,339
Well, what night is Phil's poker night?

1060
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:06,255
Well, think.

1061
01:34:07,142 --> 01:34:08,553
Yeah, all right.

1062
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:11,932
Uh, Joe, are you available Thursday night?

1063
01:34:12,021 --> 01:34:15,435
What time? Yeah, around 8:30?

1064
01:34:15,525 --> 01:34:19,018
Uh, well, let me think now.
Thursday, 8:30.

1065
01:34:19,863 --> 01:34:22,606
Uh, well, I guess I can be available.

1066
01:34:22,699 --> 01:34:24,190
Hell, yes!

1067
01:34:25,243 --> 01:34:28,953
Hello. Marjorie,
it's all set for Thursday night at 8:30.

1068
01:34:30,081 --> 01:34:34,416
Yes, it's... No, no. I can't talk to you now,
so call me at the office later.

1069
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:36,494
Yeah, okay. Bye-bye.

1070
01:34:38,047 --> 01:34:41,211
Ma'am, Shirley,
I sure hate to trouble you, but...

1071
01:34:41,301 --> 01:34:42,792
Sure.

1072
01:34:45,305 --> 01:34:47,797
- Twenty, wasn't it?
- Yes'm.

1073
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:56,980
Bye.

1074
01:35:19,172 --> 01:35:21,880
Hey, boy. Look right in there.
What do you see?

1075
01:35:21,966 --> 01:35:24,629
Look in there, boy.
Some of that stuff's for you too.

1076
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:27,086
Look. Try that on for size for you.

1077
01:35:27,931 --> 01:35:30,594
I got some of that stuff
you like to swill too.

1078
01:35:30,683 --> 01:35:33,300
Aspirin, Mentholatum, all that crap.

1079
01:35:36,314 --> 01:35:39,523
- What's the matter? They wrong?
- They're okay.

1080
01:35:39,609 --> 01:35:41,601
Only why'd you buy 'em?

1081
01:35:41,694 --> 01:35:44,937
While you were gettin' the aspirin,
I could've lifted this.

1082
01:35:45,031 --> 01:35:46,363
Is that hot?

1083
01:35:47,784 --> 01:35:49,696
- Yeah. You want some soup?
- Yeah.

1084
01:35:49,786 --> 01:35:51,823
I'll get you some soup then.

1085
01:35:51,913 --> 01:35:54,701
We ain't gonna have to steal no more,
is what I'm tryin' to tell you.

1086
01:35:54,791 --> 01:35:58,250
I got eight bucks in my damn pockets.
Twenty more come Thursday, boy.

1087
01:35:58,336 --> 01:36:00,669
We're gonna be ridin' easy before very long,
I'm gonna tell you.

1088
01:36:00,755 --> 01:36:02,667
Give me some soup. Give me some soup.

1089
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:05,670
What do you think I'm gettin' here?
I'm gettin' you some soup.

1090
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,844
Look at that there.
That's good, healthy stuff for you.

1091
01:36:09,597 --> 01:36:11,634
Lookee there. Lookee there. Soup.

1092
01:36:11,724 --> 01:36:13,932
- Thanks.
- It's hot. Watch out.

1093
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:16,768
How was she?

1094
01:36:17,522 --> 01:36:20,731
Well, she went crazy,
if you want to know the damn truth of it.

1095
01:36:20,817 --> 01:36:23,776
- Yeah?
- Yeah. She turned into a damn alley cat.

1096
01:36:23,861 --> 01:36:26,729
- Thanks for the stuff.
- Don't mention it.

1097
01:36:27,991 --> 01:36:29,482
It's good.

1098
01:36:33,413 --> 01:36:35,496
Hey, listen,
don't get sore or anything, okay?

1099
01:36:35,581 --> 01:36:37,197
I ain't sore.

1100
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:40,626
I don't think I can walk anymore.

1101
01:36:40,712 --> 01:36:42,999
I mean, I've been fallin' down a lot.

1102
01:36:46,926 --> 01:36:48,133
I'm scared.

1103
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:50,836
What are you scared of?

1104
01:36:51,764 --> 01:36:54,632
You know what they do to you
when they know you can't...

1105
01:36:54,726 --> 01:36:57,890
when they find out that you can't wa... walk.

1106
01:36:57,979 --> 01:36:59,436
Oh, Christ!

1107
01:37:02,317 --> 01:37:04,479
I gotta lay down.

1108
01:37:04,569 --> 01:37:06,561
- Okay, okay.
- I gotta lay down.

1109
01:37:06,654 --> 01:37:08,691
You're gonna lay down now.
Just take it easy.

1110
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:10,773
- Come on.
- I'm gonna lay you down.

1111
01:37:11,409 --> 01:37:13,617
I'm gonna lay you down. There you go.

1112
01:37:15,204 --> 01:37:17,537
I'm gonna put this thing over you.

1113
01:37:17,623 --> 01:37:19,364
Now, you stay here.

1114
01:37:21,627 --> 01:37:23,414
Where you goin'?

1115
01:37:23,504 --> 01:37:25,621
- I gotta get a doctor.
- What?

1116
01:37:25,715 --> 01:37:28,002
- I gotta get a doctor.
- You ain't gettin' me no doctor.

1117
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:30,709
You're sick, boy. You need a damn doctor.

1118
01:37:30,803 --> 01:37:34,592
Hey! No doctors, no cops.
Don't be so stupid.

1119
01:37:34,682 --> 01:37:37,800
- What the hell you want me to do?
- Florida. You get me to Florida.

1120
01:37:37,894 --> 01:37:40,762
Oh, hell, I can't go to Florida now.

1121
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:43,438
Just put me on a bus.
Just put me on a bus. I don't need you.

1122
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:46,187
You got the damn fever.
How the hell you gonna get to Florida?

1123
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:49,145
Just get me on a bus.
You ain't sendin' me to Bellevue.

1124
01:37:49,238 --> 01:37:52,356
All right. What are you doin'?
What are you doin' that for? It's hot.

1125
01:37:53,326 --> 01:37:56,114
- You're sick. I'm keepin' it on you.
- No. I'm too hot now.

1126
01:37:56,204 --> 01:37:59,072
Dumb. Boy, you're really dumb.

1127
01:37:59,165 --> 01:38:01,532
- I don't need you. You're dumb.
- Shut up! Just shut up!

1128
01:38:01,626 --> 01:38:03,117
Dumb cowboy, boy.

1129
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:05,669
Damn it. Shut up!

1130
01:38:05,755 --> 01:38:10,341
Oh, just when things are goin' right for me,
you gotta pull a damn stunt like this.

1131
01:38:13,179 --> 01:38:15,455
Hi, Shirley. How you doin', girl?

1132
01:38:16,808 --> 01:38:18,299
Miss who?

1133
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:22,636
Well, when will Mrs. Gardner be home?

1134
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:26,648
This is a friend of hers.
This is a goddamn good friend of hers.

1135
01:38:26,734 --> 01:38:28,225
Now, you...

1136
01:38:31,781 --> 01:38:33,898
Well, hell, I can't wait that long.

1137
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:53,421
Too bad.

1138
01:38:53,511 --> 01:38:58,472
Well, we all have our off days.

1139
01:38:58,558 --> 01:39:03,053
I'm Townsend P. Locke, from Chicago.
Call me Towny.

1140
01:39:03,146 --> 01:39:08,232
I'm here on a paper manufacturers convention
and, frankly, to have a little fun, damn it.

1141
01:39:08,317 --> 01:39:11,901
This is my first night in town, and I'd consider
it a privilege if you'd have dinner with me.

1142
01:39:11,988 --> 01:39:15,106
Anywhere you say. There's a little
French restaurant not too far from here.

1143
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:17,486
Italian restaurant? Does that appeal to you?

1144
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:22,159
Don't worry about how you're dressed.
They know me.

1145
01:39:22,248 --> 01:39:24,080
Besides, I'll tell 'em you're with the rodeo.

1146
01:39:24,167 --> 01:39:26,955
There's always a rodeo in town, damn it.

1147
01:39:27,044 --> 01:39:29,957
Besides, you look very elegant.

1148
01:39:30,047 --> 01:39:34,667
Oh, but damn it all, we can't do that.
I'm expecting a telephone call at the hotel.

1149
01:39:35,553 --> 01:39:37,510
Mama? A coincidence.

1150
01:39:37,597 --> 01:39:40,089
Guess who was being discussed.

1151
01:39:40,183 --> 01:39:42,971
Have you got that thing turned up?

1152
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:45,347
Well, why aren't you wearing it?

1153
01:39:45,438 --> 01:39:48,351
Oh, really, Mama, this is just impossible.

1154
01:39:48,441 --> 01:39:51,024
I mean, why go to all the expense?

1155
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:54,023
- Why go to all the expense, Mama? The expense.
- Listen, Towny.

1156
01:39:54,113 --> 01:39:56,856
Did I tell you I got me
a sick kid on my hands?

1157
01:39:56,949 --> 01:40:01,034
Well, he is. He's sick on chill,
and I gotta get him south quick as I can.

1158
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:05,823
I got me a sick boy,
and I'm gonna... I'm gonna get him south.

1159
01:40:05,917 --> 01:40:07,909
Do you understand me?
Do you understand me, Towny?

1160
01:40:08,002 --> 01:40:10,369
I'm gonna get him south.

1161
01:40:11,005 --> 01:40:12,337
What you want?

1162
01:40:13,424 --> 01:40:16,132
What you got me up here for?

1163
01:40:16,219 --> 01:40:17,710
Oh, Joe, it's...

1164
01:40:19,096 --> 01:40:20,712
It's so difficult. I...

1165
01:40:22,183 --> 01:40:25,472
You're a nice person, Joe.
I should never have asked you up here.

1166
01:40:27,855 --> 01:40:29,642
You're a lovely person, really.

1167
01:40:32,443 --> 01:40:35,356
Oh, God, I loathe life. I loathe it.

1168
01:40:36,364 --> 01:40:38,196
Please go. Please.

1169
01:40:38,282 --> 01:40:39,773
You want me to leave?

1170
01:40:41,661 --> 01:40:43,152
No.

1171
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:47,497
I mean, yes, yes. Please go.

1172
01:40:48,167 --> 01:40:50,625
Come back tomorrow. Promise?

1173
01:40:50,711 --> 01:40:52,247
I'm goin' to Florida tomorrow.

1174
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:54,962
That's terrible.

1175
01:40:55,049 --> 01:40:57,132
You meet someone, you think...

1176
01:40:57,218 --> 01:40:58,629
Yeah.

1177
01:40:59,595 --> 01:41:01,131
I want to give you a present...

1178
01:41:02,139 --> 01:41:04,256
for your trip.

1179
01:41:06,185 --> 01:41:07,926
Please take it.

1180
01:41:10,147 --> 01:41:12,013
I want you to have it.

1181
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:14,482
You don't have to be a Catholic.

1182
01:41:14,569 --> 01:41:16,481
<i>St. Christopher's the patron saint
of all travelers.</i>

1183
01:41:16,571 --> 01:41:20,110
I want you to take it.
It's for helping me be good.

1184
01:41:21,534 --> 01:41:23,150
I gotta have money.

1185
01:41:24,287 --> 01:41:26,825
Yes, of course. Wait here.

1186
01:41:36,132 --> 01:41:37,623
I said wait.

1187
01:41:39,093 --> 01:41:41,631
Here. Don't even thank me.

1188
01:41:41,721 --> 01:41:43,383
I gotta have more than ten.

1189
01:41:43,472 --> 01:41:46,385
- I gotta have $57.
- I simply don't have it, Joe.

1190
01:41:46,976 --> 01:41:49,764
- I got family, goddamn it.
- You're wasting your time, Joe.

1191
01:41:49,854 --> 01:41:52,562
- There's nothing in here.
- Get outta my way, please, sir.

1192
01:41:53,357 --> 01:41:56,065
Get outta my way!

1193
01:41:56,152 --> 01:41:57,893
- No, no, no.
- Let go of that table, please, sir.

1194
01:41:57,987 --> 01:42:00,274
- No, you... Please, sir?
- No, please!

1195
01:42:00,364 --> 01:42:02,401
No, don't, don't.

1196
01:42:02,491 --> 01:42:04,608
No. No. Don't.

1197
01:42:04,702 --> 01:42:07,490
Oh, I deserve that.
I brought this on myself, I know I did.

1198
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:11,369
- My nose is bleeding, isn't it?
- Now, you gonna let go of that table?

1199
01:42:11,459 --> 01:42:12,449
No, no.

1200
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:15,581
Now, are you gonna let go of that table,
or you want a busted skull?

1201
01:42:15,671 --> 01:42:18,664
Oh, Joe, Joe, Joe.

1202
01:42:22,637 --> 01:42:24,799
Oh, Joe. Thank you.

1203
01:42:24,889 --> 01:42:26,050
<i>Thank you.</i>

1204
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:27,927
<i>Operator. Number, please.</i>

1205
01:42:28,893 --> 01:42:31,385
<i>- Number, please.</i>
- Hello.

1206
01:42:31,479 --> 01:42:33,971
- No, no, I wasn't calling anyone.
<i>- Hello?</i>

1207
01:42:34,065 --> 01:42:35,351
<i>Hello!</i>

1208
01:42:35,441 --> 01:42:39,105
- I wasn't calling anyone. I wasn't calling anyone.
<i>- Hello!</i>

1209
01:42:39,195 --> 01:42:42,313
No, I wasn't calling anyone.

1210
01:42:42,406 --> 01:42:43,522
Oh, Joe, Joe, Joe.

1211
01:42:55,878 --> 01:42:57,710
Thirty-one hours.

1212
01:42:58,798 --> 01:43:01,290
11:30 in the morning we get there.

1213
01:43:02,385 --> 01:43:06,629
Not this morning, but the next at 11:30.

1214
01:43:07,932 --> 01:43:10,299
These guys are good drivers, boy.

1215
01:43:10,393 --> 01:43:11,884
They gotta be.

1216
01:43:15,523 --> 01:43:17,515
You didn't kill him, did you?

1217
01:43:19,026 --> 01:43:21,018
Got blood on your jacket.

1218
01:43:24,448 --> 01:43:26,360
I don't wanna talk about it.

1219
01:43:59,066 --> 01:44:02,355
If you're gonna shiver,
put your blankets up more.

1220
01:44:05,573 --> 01:44:07,189
I've been thinkin'.

1221
01:44:07,283 --> 01:44:10,776
I hope we're not gonna have a lot of trouble
about my name down there.

1222
01:44:10,870 --> 01:44:13,487
I mean, what's the whole point
of this trip anyway?

1223
01:44:13,581 --> 01:44:15,413
You know?

1224
01:44:15,499 --> 01:44:17,491
Keep your blankets on you.

1225
01:44:20,004 --> 01:44:24,169
I mean, can you see this guy
running around the beach all suntanned

1226
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:26,841
and he's goin' swimmin', like,

1227
01:44:26,927 --> 01:44:30,546
and then somebody yells, "Hey, Ratso."

1228
01:44:31,682 --> 01:44:33,298
What's that sound like to you?

1229
01:44:35,102 --> 01:44:36,934
Sounds like they knew you.

1230
01:44:38,022 --> 01:44:40,264
Sounds like crap. Admit it.

1231
01:44:40,357 --> 01:44:42,269
I'm Rico all the time, okay?

1232
01:44:47,531 --> 01:44:50,615
We're gonna tell all these new people
my name's Rico.

1233
01:44:53,496 --> 01:44:54,486
Okay?

1234
01:44:55,164 --> 01:44:56,245
Okay.

1235
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:33,033
Hey, what's the matter?

1236
01:45:33,118 --> 01:45:34,529
I'm wet.

1237
01:45:34,620 --> 01:45:36,327
You're... You're what?

1238
01:45:37,206 --> 01:45:39,448
I wet my pants. The seat's all wet.

1239
01:45:40,543 --> 01:45:44,537
Well, hell, there ain't no use cryin'
over the damn thing.

1240
01:45:46,674 --> 01:45:49,132
Here I am goin' to Florida, my leg hurts,

1241
01:45:49,218 --> 01:45:51,710
my butt hurts, my chest hurts,
my face hurts,

1242
01:45:52,555 --> 01:45:55,172
and like that ain't enough,
I gotta pee all over myself.

1243
01:45:57,142 --> 01:46:00,761
That's funny? I'm fallin' apart here.

1244
01:46:01,772 --> 01:46:04,139
You just... You know what happened?

1245
01:46:04,233 --> 01:46:07,601
You just took a little rest stop
that wasn't on the schedule.

1246
01:46:23,586 --> 01:46:25,578
Let me put you up here.

1247
01:46:30,634 --> 01:46:33,672
Hey, what size pants you wear?

1248
01:47:04,710 --> 01:47:06,542
Thank you, ma'am.

1249
01:47:08,505 --> 01:47:10,918
- Where you from?
- New York.

1250
01:47:12,051 --> 01:47:13,883
You ever been here before?

1251
01:47:13,969 --> 01:47:15,926
No, ma'am, I ain't. This is my first time.

1252
01:47:17,222 --> 01:47:20,511
- Well, I hope you have a good time in Florida.
- Thank you.

1253
01:47:30,569 --> 01:47:32,356
Hey.

1254
01:47:32,446 --> 01:47:34,062
Hey, what are you doin'?

1255
01:47:34,156 --> 01:47:36,990
I'm zippin' your fly.
What the hell you think I'm doin'?

1256
01:48:02,518 --> 01:48:04,635
Thanks, Joe.

1257
01:48:04,728 --> 01:48:06,936
These shirts are comfortable, ain't they?

1258
01:48:07,773 --> 01:48:10,891
Yours was the only one left
with a palm tree on it.

1259
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:19,783
Clothes are damn cheap here too.
You know that?

1260
01:48:26,417 --> 01:48:29,410
Everything we got
only set us back ten and some.

1261
01:48:32,214 --> 01:48:34,422
Hey, you know, Ratso...

1262
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:37,337
Rico, I mean.

1263
01:48:37,428 --> 01:48:39,886
I got this damn thing all figured out.

1264
01:48:39,972 --> 01:48:41,964
When we get to Miami,

1265
01:48:42,057 --> 01:48:45,846
what I'm gonna do is get some sort of job,
you know?

1266
01:48:46,812 --> 01:48:49,270
'Cause, hell, I ain't no kind of hustler.

1267
01:48:49,356 --> 01:48:52,520
I mean, there must be an easier way
of makin' a livin' than that.

1268
01:48:53,694 --> 01:48:55,856
Some sort of outdoors work.

1269
01:48:57,281 --> 01:48:58,988
What do you think?

1270
01:49:03,704 --> 01:49:05,696
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.

1271
01:49:07,666 --> 01:49:09,248
Okay, Rico?

1272
01:49:14,465 --> 01:49:15,956
Rico?

1273
01:49:19,219 --> 01:49:20,630
Rico.

1274
01:49:20,721 --> 01:49:22,212
Hey, Rico?

1275
01:49:23,307 --> 01:49:24,798
Rico?

1276
01:49:57,049 --> 01:50:00,042
Okay, folks, everything's all right.
Nothin' to worry about.

1277
01:50:05,099 --> 01:50:06,715
Is he kin to you?

1278
01:50:09,603 --> 01:50:11,595
Wanna close his eyes?

1279
01:50:11,688 --> 01:50:15,272
- What?
- Just reach over and close his eyes.

1280
01:50:22,282 --> 01:50:26,242
We'll just drive on in, all right?
Nothin' else we can do.

1281
01:50:26,954 --> 01:50:30,447
Okay, folks, just a little illness.
We'll be in Miami in a few minutes.

1282
01:50:35,212 --> 01:50:37,454
Okay, folks, nothin' to worry about.

1283
01:50:37,548 --> 01:50:40,837
Just a little illness.
We'll be in Miami in just a few minutes.
