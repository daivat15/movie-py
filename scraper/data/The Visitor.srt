(HIGH-PITCHED SOUNDS)

00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:35,714
Once, far away, light years,

3
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,966
distances beyond thought,

4
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:43,679
a great, slender ship
with a tail of fire

5
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,348
slid through the black
reaches of space.

6
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:50,311
On that ship was Zatine...

7
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,856
a prisoner named Zatine.

8
00:03:54,274 --> 00:03:59,652
Words cannot describe
his evil, his criminality.

9
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,531
He had been captured
by Commander Yaveth,

10
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,285
after decades of search and evasion

11
00:04:05,285 --> 00:04:10,498
in a blood-drenched battle that
claimed hundreds of lives.

12
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:17,756
But shortly thereafter,
Zatine escaped in a tiny scout craft.

13
00:04:17,756 --> 00:04:20,132
A fantastic escape

14
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:22,552
from that spaceship.

15
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,680
And soon, he found a hiding place

16
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,184
on the planet Earth.

17
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:38,484
Zatine was a mutant,
his genes transformed.

18
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:42,404
A mutant with a primal wish to kill,

19
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:47,411
but evolved to new psychic
and occult powers.

20
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:52,540
He used these powers to
spread destruction and death.

21
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:56,335
In order to find and destroy Zatine,

22
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:59,631
Commander Yaveth tried many methods.

23
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:04,428
One of these methods was
an immense army of birds,

24
00:05:04,428 --> 00:05:07,138
trained to hunt and to kill.

25
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:11,809
But when these birds
did discover Zatine,

26
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:15,395
he transformed himself into an eagle,

27
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:20,276
and managed to destroy them all...

28
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:23,363
except for three,

29
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:28,951
which survived and wounded
him fatally in the brain.

30
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:32,412
But Zatine, now dead,

31
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,333
lived on in another way.

32
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:39,755
Before he was killed,
he mated with Earth women,

33
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,424
procreating numerous children

34
00:05:42,424 --> 00:05:46,510
and thereby transmitting his
wicked spirit and evil powers

35
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:49,805
through new generations.

36
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,894
Yet the struggle continued

37
00:05:53,894 --> 00:05:56,020
and still goes on.

38
00:05:56,022 --> 00:06:01,441
For Yaveth's descendants
pursued the progeny of Zatine

39
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:08,575
lest their contamination
spread through the cosmos.

40
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,317
Has it happened again?

41
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,195

42
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,032

means, they'll have new money.

new ball players like Abdul.

team, Raymond. The best.

175
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:07,657
It's going to be very
easy for you to win now.

176
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,578
Are you pleased with what you have?
Is it what you wanted?

177
00:22:10,578 --> 00:22:12,787
Yes, I am, of course.

178
00:22:12,788 --> 00:22:15,707
Good.

179
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:18,626
We're in great danger, Raymond.

180
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,630
- The visitor?
- Katie has been designated for that.

181
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,423
Your problem is her mother.

182
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,593
Time is not on our side.

183
00:22:28,012 --> 00:22:29,930
It's on your side.

184
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:35,144
We realise, Raymond,
that Barbara's resisting strongly.

185
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,812
That she doesn't want more children.

186
00:22:36,812 --> 00:22:40,316
Up to this point, you have failed.

187
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,901
Barbara has refused to marry you.

188
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,738
And for us, this is a
very serious matter.

189
00:22:47,031 --> 00:22:51,035
We've always believed that it was not
necessary for you to understand everything.

190
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:57,750
But now, we feel compelled to
reveal to you our real motive.

191
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:02,296
Raymond, I'm going to tell you
something of tremendous importance.

192
00:23:02,296 --> 00:23:06,050
But I must warn you that any
mistake on your part now

193
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,552
would have appalling consequences,

194
00:23:08,552 --> 00:23:12,264
both for you and for us.

195
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:18,562
Barbara is a miracle of nature.

196
00:23:19,522 --> 00:23:22,024
She carries in her womb...

197
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:26,402
something which transcends
the world of everyday reality.

198
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:31,991
She is able to give birth to
children of immense powers,

199
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,578
both natural and supernatural.

200
00:23:34,578 --> 00:23:38,082
She is the only woman
of this generation

201
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,917
who carries the genes...

202
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,171
of Zatine.

203
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:48,175
She was assigned to you...

204
00:23:49,343 --> 00:23:52,178
so far, without success.

205
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,890
We wanna do everything in our
power to assist you, Raymond.

206
00:23:55,891 --> 00:23:59,645
And we feel that events in the next
few days will help your mission,

207
00:23:59,645 --> 00:24:03,022
and that you will achieve our intent.

208
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,734
But we've invested a great
deal of time and money in you.

209
00:24:06,735 --> 00:24:09,071
And we cannot wait much longer.

210
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:12,615
We need another child like Katie.

211
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:18,412
Barbara must give birth
to a brother for Katie.

212
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:23,042
Power corrupts, Raymond.

213
00:24:23,043 --> 00:24:26,630
And absolute power
corrupts absolutely.

214
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:31,218
But we must have that power.

- A parrot.
- A parrot.

It's a winding.
And after you winding it,

what, a cage or a box?

336
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:11,478

until you finish class, is that what you want?

I don't like you.
You're a child molester.

I won't ask you anything else.

OK. What about the bird the
aunt said she put in the box?

370
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,603

I mean, it's gotta be some
kind of wild damn accident.

do things like that?

we'll come another time.

unbelievable happened.

- So you want an abortion.

You've ruined everything.

867
01:39:51,526 --> 01:39:54,068

You can't kill children.

887
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:42,875
Only the evil part.

888
01:45:43,836 --> 01:45:46,879
No, that's not war.
