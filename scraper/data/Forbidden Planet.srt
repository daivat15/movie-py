1
00:01:32,274 --> 00:01:34,708
In the final decade
of the 21st century...

2
00:01:34,777 --> 00:01:38,475
men and women in rocket ships
landed on the moon.

3
00:01:38,548 --> 00:01:43,247
By 2200 A.D., they had reached
the other planets of our solar system.

4
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:46,482
Almost at once there followed
the discovery of hyper-drive...

5
00:01:46,556 --> 00:01:48,922
through which the speed of light
was first attained...

6
00:01:48,992 --> 00:01:51,052
and later greatly surpassed.

7
00:01:51,128 --> 00:01:54,586
And so at last,
mankind began the conquest...

8
00:01:54,665 --> 00:01:57,259
and colonization of deep space.

9
00:01:57,334 --> 00:02:00,667
United Planets cruiser C-57-D...

10
00:02:00,738 --> 00:02:03,902
now more than a year out from Earth base
on a special mission...

11
00:02:03,975 --> 00:02:08,378
to the planetary system of
the great main sequence star, Altair.

12
00:02:16,255 --> 00:02:19,918
- When do we get a D.C. fix, Jerry?
- Half a minute, Skipper.

13
00:02:22,562 --> 00:02:26,158
Ship on course, sir.
We'll reach D.C. point at 1701.

14
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:28,599
That's less than three minutes now.

15
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:32,865
- All right, take it away.
- Aye, aye, sir.

16
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:37,134
Chief, we'll drop back below light speed
in about three minutes.

17
00:02:37,212 --> 00:02:39,339
- Got your breakable gear stowed?
- Aye, aye, sir.

18
00:02:39,414 --> 00:02:40,745
All right. Good.

19
00:02:43,618 --> 00:02:45,882
D.C. set and punched on, Skipper.

20
00:02:45,954 --> 00:02:50,619
All right, attention. Captain to crew.
All hands squared away to decelerate.

21
00:02:50,693 --> 00:02:53,924
Ship's beeper will, as usual,
sound ten times after lights dim.

22
00:02:53,996 --> 00:02:56,396
- Come on, Doc. D.C., Bosun.
- Aye, aye, sir.

23
00:02:56,465 --> 00:03:00,493
D.C. stations, on the double.

24
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,368
Wanna bounce through this one?

25
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:21,348
All right, we're down
to.3896 of light speed.

26
00:04:24,661 --> 00:04:27,357
It's a little warm
in here, Skipper.

27
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,552
There's Altair
right on the nose, Skipper.

28
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:05,027
Meanwhile, this ship
arranges its own eclipses.

29
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:15,142
Okay, Jerry, punch out
an orbit on the fourth planet.

30
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:17,150
Aye, aye, Skipper.

31
00:05:19,254 --> 00:05:23,281
Ship in approach, Skipper.
Helical vector oriented.

32
00:05:23,358 --> 00:05:26,088
Attention.
Captain to crew. Attention.

33
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:30,258
Our destination, Altair-4,
is now visible on the main view-plate.

34
00:05:32,235 --> 00:05:36,035
As you'll recollect from your briefing
lectures, this is an Earth-type planet.

35
00:05:36,105 --> 00:05:39,268
Twenty years ago, the spacecraft
Belerephon landed here...

36
00:05:39,342 --> 00:05:41,208
with a prospecting
party of scientists.

37
00:05:41,412 --> 00:05:45,246
Our mission is to search for survivors.
That is all.

38
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,302
The Lord sure makes
some beautiful worlds.

39
00:06:05,371 --> 00:06:08,067
How do these continents
check with the old charts?

40
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,598
Be able to tell you better in a while,
Skipper. It's time for brakes.

41
00:06:11,677 --> 00:06:14,077
Okay, take it away.

42
00:06:14,146 --> 00:06:17,514
Astrogator to crew.
Stand by to change flux.

43
00:06:43,846 --> 00:06:46,542
Another one of them new worlds.

44
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,983
No beer, no women,
no pool parlors, nothing.

45
00:06:50,053 --> 00:06:53,648
Nothing to do but throw rocks at tin
cans, and we gotta bring our own cans.

46
00:06:53,723 --> 00:06:56,317
Attention. Captain to crew.

47
00:06:56,392 --> 00:06:59,691
We are now entering
the atmosphere of Altair-4.

48
00:06:59,762 --> 00:07:02,425
No survival suits
will be required upon landing.

49
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,028
Oxygen content:
4.7 richer than Earth standard.

50
00:07:07,104 --> 00:07:09,470
Gravity, only.897.

51
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,338
Adjust your equipment accordingly.
That is all.

52
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:14,810
All hands, check equipment.

53
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:29,123
Not even any short-range
radio signals yet?

54
00:07:29,195 --> 00:07:31,129
Not so far, sir.

55
00:07:35,535 --> 00:07:38,004
Can you make out
anything down there?

56
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:40,869
I may be missing
some individual structures...

57
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:44,468
but there are no cities,
ports, roads, bridges, dams.

58
00:07:44,545 --> 00:07:46,479
There's just
no sign of civilization.

59
00:07:49,617 --> 00:07:52,484
Sir, we're being radar-scanned.

60
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:54,613
- Can you zero on it?
- No, sir.

61
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:58,216
It seems to emanate from
an area of about 20 miles square.

62
00:07:58,293 --> 00:08:00,524
Twenty miles square?

63
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:04,326
Bosun, pass the alert.

64
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,267
Combat stations. Blaster men,
activate your scopes.

65
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:09,531
Radio contact, sir.
There's a voice.

66
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:11,540
- Human?
- It sounds like it.

67
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:13,542
Boost it.

68
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,639
Spaceship, identify yourself.
You're being tracked.

69
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:21,013
Cut me in, Quinn.

70
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:26,182
United Planets Cruiser C-57-D,
J.J. Adams commanding.

71
00:08:26,257 --> 00:08:29,454
- Who are you?
- Morbius of theBelerephon.

72
00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:33,190
- Who?
- Edward Morbius.

73
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,462
Here it is. "Morbius, E. Ph.D., Lit.D.
Expedition philologist."

74
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:43,406
- Philologist?
- What do you wish here, cruiser?

75
00:08:43,475 --> 00:08:47,879
You don't understand. We're your
relief. We're glad to find you alive.

76
00:08:47,947 --> 00:08:50,177
I, of course,
appreciate your concern...

77
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,346
but absolutely no assistance
of any sort is required.

78
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,185
The red carpet treatment, huh?

79
00:08:57,258 --> 00:09:01,217
Dr. Morbius, my orders are to
survey the situation on Altair-4.

80
00:09:01,295 --> 00:09:04,594
Let me repeat:
I'm in no sort of difficulty here.

81
00:09:04,665 --> 00:09:09,000
Your best procedure will be to
turn back at once without landing.

82
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,503
Sorry, sir.

83
00:09:10,572 --> 00:09:13,006
If you set down on this planet,
I warn you...

84
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:18,102
that I cannot be answerable for
the safety of your ship or your crew.

85
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:21,638
If you'll just supply me
with landing coordinates.

86
00:09:23,452 --> 00:09:26,546
Dr. Morbius,
I require landing coordinates.

87
00:09:26,622 --> 00:09:30,923
Very well, but I wash my hands
of all responsibility.

88
00:09:30,994 --> 00:09:34,828
- You have standard charts?
- Yes, sir.

89
00:09:34,898 --> 00:09:40,200
You may come in at 83-17-4 north...

90
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:44,071
148-21 west.

91
00:09:44,142 --> 00:09:45,734
Thank you.

92
00:09:47,745 --> 00:09:49,906
It's right back there
in the desert.

93
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:54,009
Commander, I urge you to reconsider.
Please permit me to recommend...

94
00:09:55,421 --> 00:09:57,582
Something funny down there, Skipper.

95
00:10:01,427 --> 00:10:03,827
Okay, Jerry, I'll take her in.

96
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:05,329
Right.

97
00:10:08,168 --> 00:10:11,194
Attention. Captain to crew.
Stand by to reverse polarity.

98
00:10:11,271 --> 00:10:15,298
Standard class "A" security
will be maintained upon landing...

99
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:18,277
and until further notice,
all hands will wear side arms.

100
00:10:18,346 --> 00:10:20,610
That is all.

101
00:10:20,681 --> 00:10:22,615
- Artificial gravity off.
- Grav. off.

102
00:10:22,683 --> 00:10:24,116
- Half flux.
- Half flux.

103
00:10:24,185 --> 00:10:27,177
- Cut primary coils.
- Primaries cut, sir.

104
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:34,727
All clear, sir.

105
00:11:42,937 --> 00:11:44,871
Look at the color of that sky.

106
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:47,134
Yeah, but I'll still take blue.

107
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,269
I don't know. I think a man
could get used to this...

108
00:11:50,345 --> 00:11:51,937
and grow to love it.

109
00:11:52,014 --> 00:11:54,881
Bosun, you can assemble the tractor.

110
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,145
Better check the command mike.

111
00:11:57,219 --> 00:12:00,188
- The command mike, sir.
- Oh, good idea.

112
00:12:00,255 --> 00:12:01,518
- Chief?
- Sir?

113
00:12:01,591 --> 00:12:04,151
You're in command now, Quinn.
You keep right at those instruments.

114
00:12:04,227 --> 00:12:07,424
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Hey, what's this dust coming?

115
00:12:21,979 --> 00:12:23,914
Looks like we're being met.

116
00:12:23,982 --> 00:12:25,916
Bosun.

117
00:12:25,984 --> 00:12:28,418
Hold the tractor.

118
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:34,122
- Quite a vehicle, huh?
- That driver must be a madman.

119
00:12:35,293 --> 00:12:37,455
What driver?

120
00:13:08,363 --> 00:13:11,458
Welcome to Altair-4, gentlemen.

121
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:14,833
I am to transport you
to the residence.

122
00:13:16,872 --> 00:13:19,807
If you do not speak English...

123
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:23,312
I am at your disposal
with 187 other languages...

124
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,076
along with their various
dialects and sub-tongues.

125
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:30,313
Colloquial English
will do fine, thank you.

126
00:13:30,387 --> 00:13:34,324
This is no offense,
but you are a robot, aren't you?

127
00:13:35,993 --> 00:13:37,927
That is correct, sir.

128
00:13:37,995 --> 00:13:42,898
For your convenience, I am monitored
to respond to the name "Robby."

129
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:46,631
Nice climate you have here.

130
00:13:46,705 --> 00:13:48,730
High oxygen content.

131
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:53,039
I rarely use it myself, sir.
It promotes rust.

132
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,208
Hey, Doc,
is it a male or a female?

133
00:13:59,986 --> 00:14:04,423
In my case, sir, the question
is totally without meaning.

134
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,424
Will you get in, gentlemen?

135
00:14:15,235 --> 00:14:19,332
Quinn, tractors if I blink red.

136
00:14:19,407 --> 00:14:22,205
- I'll bring a tractor in a hurry, sir.
- Right.

137
00:14:41,263 --> 00:14:44,859
Passengers will please
fasten their seat belts.

138
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:51,373
Looks after us like a mother.

139
00:15:11,497 --> 00:15:14,796
If you gentlemen will go in,
you're expected.

140
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:30,776
- I am Morbius.
- I am Commander Adams.

141
00:15:30,851 --> 00:15:33,183
This is Lieutenant Farman,
my executive...

142
00:15:33,254 --> 00:15:35,688
and Lieutenant Ostrow,
our ship's doctor.

143
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,063
How ironic that a simple scholar
with no ambition...

144
00:15:43,131 --> 00:15:46,464
beyond a modest measure of seclusion,
should, out of a clear sky...

145
00:15:46,535 --> 00:15:50,335
find himself besieged by
an army of fellow creatures...

146
00:15:50,405 --> 00:15:53,204
all grimly determined
to be of service to him.

147
00:15:53,276 --> 00:15:57,713
I'm sorry, sir, if we're not welcome,
but we do have our orders.

148
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,271
But you must stay
for lunch, gentlemen...

149
00:16:00,349 --> 00:16:03,045
and do forgive the ill manners
of an old recluse.

150
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,054
Won't you come in?

151
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:18,732
Whatever that lunch was,
it was certainly delicious.

152
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:21,237
Simply some of Robby's synthetics.

153
00:16:21,306 --> 00:16:25,766
- He's your cook too?
- Even manufactures the raw materials.

154
00:16:25,844 --> 00:16:28,075
Come around here, Robby.

155
00:16:28,147 --> 00:16:31,241
I'll show you how this works.

156
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,717
One introduces a sample of human food
through this aperture.

157
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:42,489
Here there's a small built-in chemical
laboratory where he analyzes it.

158
00:16:42,562 --> 00:16:45,963
Later he can reproduce identical
molecules in any shape or quantity.

159
00:16:46,032 --> 00:16:49,469
Why, it's a housewife's dream.

160
00:16:49,537 --> 00:16:52,028
Plus absolute selfless obedience.

161
00:16:52,106 --> 00:16:55,041
Activate the dispose-all unit.

162
00:17:05,354 --> 00:17:07,822
A household disintegrator beam.

163
00:17:08,624 --> 00:17:11,252
Put your arm in there.

164
00:17:13,463 --> 00:17:15,897
Order cancelled.

165
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:18,126
Don't attribute feeling
to him, gentlemen.

166
00:17:18,201 --> 00:17:21,398
Robby is simply a tool.
Tremendously strong, of course.

167
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:24,964
He could quite easily topple
this house off its foundation.

168
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:28,534
In the wrong hands, mightn't
such a tool become a deadly weapon?

169
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:32,742
No, Doctor, not even though I were the
mad scientist of the tape thrillers...

170
00:17:32,817 --> 00:17:36,049
because, you see, there happens
to be a built-in safety factor.

171
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:40,387
Commander, may I borrow that
formidable-Iooking side arm of yours?

172
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,496
Thank you.

173
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:52,470
Robby, point this thing at that
althaea frutex out there on the terrace.

174
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,635
Fire.

175
00:18:00,981 --> 00:18:03,108
You understand the mechanism?

176
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:07,620
Yes, Morbius.
A simple blaster.

177
00:18:07,688 --> 00:18:10,954
All right.
Now turn around here.

178
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,094
Point it at the commander.

179
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:22,430
Aim right between the eyes.

180
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:28,542
Fire.

181
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:38,253
You see, he's helpless...

182
00:18:38,321 --> 00:18:41,620
Iocked in a sub-electronic dilemma
between my direct orders...

183
00:18:41,691 --> 00:18:45,093
and his basic inhibitions
against harming rational beings.

184
00:18:45,162 --> 00:18:47,562
Cancelled.

185
00:18:47,632 --> 00:18:50,260
If I were to allow
that to continue...

186
00:18:50,334 --> 00:18:53,497
he would blow
every circuit in his body.

187
00:18:55,473 --> 00:18:58,409
Doctor, how did you
come by such a mechanism?

188
00:18:58,477 --> 00:19:02,208
Uh, I didn't
"come by" him, Doctor...

189
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:06,741
I tinkered him together
during my first months up here.

190
00:19:06,818 --> 00:19:10,448
- Coffee is ready, sir.
- Gentlemen.

191
00:19:10,523 --> 00:19:15,324
Doctor, do you mean that
you made this gentleman?

192
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:17,829
A useful enough toy, Lieutenant...

193
00:19:17,897 --> 00:19:21,732
but nowadays I have
no time for such things.

194
00:19:23,404 --> 00:19:27,602
Dr. Morbius, you're a philologist,
an expert in words and languages...

195
00:19:27,675 --> 00:19:29,609
their origins and meanings.

196
00:19:29,677 --> 00:19:32,704
Yet this robot of yours
is beyond the combined resources...

197
00:19:32,781 --> 00:19:35,716
of all Earth's physical science.

198
00:19:35,784 --> 00:19:38,776
My dear Commander,
maybe you overestimate...

199
00:19:38,853 --> 00:19:41,549
both Robby and myself.

200
00:19:41,623 --> 00:19:45,355
Gentlemen, let me show you
another bit of parlor magic.

201
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:56,639
Forgive me. I didn't mean
to alarm you, gentlemen.

202
00:19:56,707 --> 00:19:59,039
I had Robby install
the steel shutters...

203
00:19:59,109 --> 00:20:02,010
before I realized how
altogether safe I am here.

204
00:20:08,786 --> 00:20:12,017
Well, gentlemen,
this has been very pleasant.

205
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,388
You've seen how
comfortable I am here...

206
00:20:14,459 --> 00:20:18,191
no hardships,
no special difficulties...

207
00:20:18,263 --> 00:20:21,027
and no need at all
for military assistance.

208
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,864
Now I daresay you're impatient
to get back to base.

209
00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:27,394
Yes, the moment we've interviewed the
other members of the Belerephon party.

210
00:20:28,842 --> 00:20:32,505
Others. But there are
no others, Commander.

211
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:35,980
Before the first year was out,
they had all, every man and woman...

212
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:40,282
succumbed to a...
to a sort of a planetary force here...

213
00:20:40,354 --> 00:20:44,085
some dark, terrible,
incomprehensible force.

214
00:20:44,158 --> 00:20:46,092
Only my wife and I were immune.

215
00:20:47,228 --> 00:20:50,095
And just how do you account
for your immunity, Dr. Morbius?

216
00:20:50,164 --> 00:20:54,363
We differed from the others only
in our special love for this world...

217
00:20:54,436 --> 00:20:57,633
in our boundless longing
to make a home here...

218
00:20:57,706 --> 00:21:00,903
far from the scurry
and strife of humankind.

219
00:21:02,377 --> 00:21:06,337
I remember how, when the vote
was taken to return to Earth...

220
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:09,783
she and I were utterly heartbroken.

221
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:13,788
How could we have foreseen the
extinction of coworkers and friends?

222
00:21:15,426 --> 00:21:18,953
Skipper, there is no record of any wife
in the Belerephon rolls.

223
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:22,556
Lieutenant, look under
"biochemistry," Julia Marsin.

224
00:21:22,633 --> 00:21:25,500
She and I were married
by the skipper on the voyage here.

225
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:27,333
I have the certificate.

226
00:21:27,405 --> 00:21:31,933
I thought Robby had managed some
very charming feminine touches.

227
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,535
I take it Mrs. Morbius
isn't at home today?

228
00:21:34,612 --> 00:21:37,946
My dear wife died
a few months after the others.

229
00:21:38,017 --> 00:21:41,418
Only in her case,
it was of natural causes.

230
00:21:41,487 --> 00:21:43,546
I'm very sorry.

231
00:21:43,622 --> 00:21:46,090
Dr. Morbius,
just what were the symptoms...

232
00:21:46,158 --> 00:21:49,253
of all those other deaths,
the unnatural ones?

233
00:21:49,329 --> 00:21:51,957
The symptoms were
striking, Commander.

234
00:21:52,032 --> 00:21:54,364
One by one,
in spite of every safeguard...

235
00:21:54,434 --> 00:21:57,062
my coworkers were torn
literally limb from limb.

236
00:21:57,137 --> 00:21:58,434
By what?

237
00:21:58,505 --> 00:22:00,906
By some devilish thing
that never once showed itself.

238
00:22:00,975 --> 00:22:02,909
- And the Belerephon?
- Vaporized...

239
00:22:02,977 --> 00:22:06,071
as the three remaining survivors
tried to take her off.

240
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:11,079
And yet, in all these 19 years...

241
00:22:11,152 --> 00:22:15,681
you personally have never again
been bothered by this planetary force?

242
00:22:17,526 --> 00:22:20,927
Only in nightmares
of those times.

243
00:22:20,996 --> 00:22:23,226
And yet, always in my mind...

244
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:26,632
I seem to feel the creature
is lurking somewhere close at hand...

245
00:22:26,703 --> 00:22:31,072
sly and irresistible, and only waiting
to be re-invoked for murder.

246
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:35,670
Father?

247
00:22:38,415 --> 00:22:40,349
Alta!

248
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:42,783
Alta, I specifically asked you...

249
00:22:42,853 --> 00:22:44,844
not to join us for lunch.

250
00:22:44,922 --> 00:22:46,948
But, Father, lunch is over.

251
00:22:47,025 --> 00:22:50,153
I'm sure you never said a word
about not coming in for coffee.

252
00:22:50,228 --> 00:22:52,628
Well, did you or did you?

253
00:22:52,697 --> 00:22:55,291
This is Commander Adams...

254
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:59,065
Dr. Ostrow and, uh,
Lieutenant Farman.

255
00:22:59,138 --> 00:23:00,571
- My daughter.
- How do you do?

256
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,270
I've always so terribly wanted to meet
a young man, and now three at once.

257
00:23:05,344 --> 00:23:08,040
- That's very kind of you.
- You're lovely, Doctor.

258
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:12,647
Of course, the two end ones
are unbelievable.

259
00:23:14,321 --> 00:23:16,789
Could this end one
get you some coffee?

260
00:23:16,857 --> 00:23:19,621
I'm quite able to get it,
thank you.

261
00:23:27,969 --> 00:23:29,561
Thank you.

262
00:23:29,637 --> 00:23:32,869
Of course, you must make allowances
for my daughter, gentlemen.

263
00:23:32,942 --> 00:23:37,242
She's never known any human being
except her father.

264
00:23:37,313 --> 00:23:39,838
I hope you'll make
allowances too, sir.

265
00:23:39,915 --> 00:23:44,284
We young men have been shut up in
hyperspace for well over a year now...

266
00:23:44,353 --> 00:23:46,879
and right from here,
the view looks just like heaven.

267
00:23:46,957 --> 00:23:48,390
Sugar?

268
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:52,087
But you keep helping me.
After all, you're not Robby.

269
00:23:52,162 --> 00:23:55,029
I wouldn't mind being Robby
in certain ways.

270
00:23:55,098 --> 00:23:58,330
That's only in certain ways,
of course.

271
00:23:58,402 --> 00:24:02,600
I can see that was probably very clever,
but I don't seem to understand it.

272
00:24:02,673 --> 00:24:06,200
Well, there's...
There's no rush.

273
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:13,210
I suppose one day I shall be obliged
to make the trip to Earth with her...

274
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,914
for the sake of her
natural development.

275
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:19,481
I should say fairly soon too.

276
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,927
Your father wasn't too happy at first
about your meeting us, was he?

277
00:24:23,997 --> 00:24:26,864
Well, naturally not.
You're from Earth.

278
00:24:26,933 --> 00:24:30,369
- What's wrong with Earth?
- How lucky I am, though.

279
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:34,373
All three of you are such
very fine exceptions.

280
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:38,138
- You are exceptions, aren't you?
- Oh, sure, sure.

281
00:24:38,212 --> 00:24:40,237
That is, I am, anyway.

282
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:43,079
Old dependable Jerry.

283
00:24:43,151 --> 00:24:47,417
Of course, the doc can be trusted too,
in the daytime.

284
00:24:49,257 --> 00:24:51,782
What about the commander?

285
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,989
Well, I hate to tell
you this, Alta, but...

286
00:24:55,064 --> 00:24:59,694
that man is notorious
throughout seven planetary systems.

287
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:03,296
Oh, dear.
What does he do?

288
00:25:03,372 --> 00:25:05,705
Well, I don't feel
free to discuss...

289
00:25:05,776 --> 00:25:09,803
the shortcomings of
a fellow officer, but...

290
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,510
any girl or woman who lets him
get her alone, anywhere...

291
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,787
Yes, I can see it now.

292
00:25:24,862 --> 00:25:28,765
There, just then when he looked at me,
his eyes almost had fire in them.

293
00:25:30,235 --> 00:25:34,171
I'm so glad you don't have
any fire in your eyes, Lieutenant.

294
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:36,434
Well, I'm not that harmless.

295
00:25:36,508 --> 00:25:39,842
- Alta?
- Yes, Father?

296
00:25:41,981 --> 00:25:44,950
These gentlemen have expressed
a very kindly concern...

297
00:25:45,018 --> 00:25:47,782
- over the amount of liberty you have.
- Liberty?

298
00:25:47,854 --> 00:25:51,655
I told them that you have my permission
to visit Earth whenever you choose.

299
00:25:51,726 --> 00:25:53,990
Earth? I?

300
00:25:54,061 --> 00:25:57,553
Then my little girl
never feels Ionely or confined?

301
00:25:57,631 --> 00:26:01,829
Why, I don't know.
I have you and Robby and all my friends.

302
00:26:01,902 --> 00:26:03,427
Friends?

303
00:26:06,675 --> 00:26:09,974
- Perhaps you'd better call them, dear.
- All right.

304
00:26:10,045 --> 00:26:11,808
Come, gentlemen.

305
00:26:18,521 --> 00:26:21,786
I felt something
go right through my head.

306
00:26:21,858 --> 00:26:26,421
Alta's whistle is above the pitch of
human hearing. I often feel it myself.

307
00:26:49,455 --> 00:26:51,514
- What's up?
- Look.

308
00:26:56,262 --> 00:26:57,889
No. Watch.

309
00:27:05,639 --> 00:27:08,073
Why, he's as tame as a kitten.

310
00:27:08,141 --> 00:27:12,169
Outside of the range of my daughter's
influence, it's still a deadly beast.

311
00:27:23,357 --> 00:27:26,191
Just a routine checkup from the ship.

312
00:27:26,261 --> 00:27:28,525
- What, Chief?
- Everything okay, Commander?

313
00:27:28,597 --> 00:27:31,589
- No problem.
- Would you mind activating the viewer?

314
00:27:34,937 --> 00:27:39,466
As you can see, we're under
no restraint whatsoever.

315
00:27:41,377 --> 00:27:43,140
Knock that off, Quinn.

316
00:27:43,213 --> 00:27:47,412
If I can be of any help to you in your
preparations for the homeward voyage...

317
00:27:47,485 --> 00:27:51,785
Thank you, sir, but unfortunately
circumstances may keep us here a while.

318
00:27:51,856 --> 00:27:54,051
- Circumstances?
- You see, my orders...

319
00:27:54,124 --> 00:27:56,615
don't quite seem to cover
the Belerephon fatalities.

320
00:27:56,694 --> 00:28:01,098
I am forced now to contact base
for new instructions.

321
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:04,192
But, Commander,
suppose these new instructions...

322
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:07,500
require my return to Earth
for questioning...

323
00:28:07,572 --> 00:28:10,201
two years or more
away from my work here?

324
00:28:10,276 --> 00:28:14,736
Tell me, just what is involved
in your making contact with Earth base?

325
00:28:14,814 --> 00:28:17,442
Fundamentally,
it's a question of crude power...

326
00:28:17,517 --> 00:28:20,918
how to short-circuit the continuum
on a five or six parsec level.

327
00:28:20,987 --> 00:28:23,548
Of course, a transmitter like that
isn't standard equipment.

328
00:28:23,624 --> 00:28:25,558
- No.
- To build one...

329
00:28:25,626 --> 00:28:29,062
we'd cannibalize about two-thirds
of the ship's electronic gear...

330
00:28:29,129 --> 00:28:31,222
and then unship
the main drive to juice it.

331
00:28:31,298 --> 00:28:35,759
Just to construct a bunker to house
the core would take about ten days.

332
00:28:35,837 --> 00:28:39,000
Disabled here
for ten days and nights?

333
00:28:39,073 --> 00:28:42,440
Tell me, would two-inch
lead shielding do as well?

334
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:45,503
It'd be better if we happened to be
carrying 100 square yards of the stuff.

335
00:28:45,581 --> 00:28:47,674
Then I'll have Robby
run it off for you...

336
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,548
and you'll get it
not later than tomorrow noon.

337
00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:53,213
That's very obliging of you, sir.

338
00:28:53,289 --> 00:28:55,189
Obliging?

339
00:28:55,257 --> 00:28:58,250
Look out there, Commander,
the Belerephon party.

340
00:28:58,328 --> 00:29:01,627
Nineteen years ago
I dug those graves with my own hands...

341
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:05,566
and I have, believe me,
no wish to repeat that experience.

342
00:29:20,118 --> 00:29:23,519
We'll see you again soon,
Alta, I hope.

343
00:29:23,589 --> 00:29:27,423
- Thank you very much, Doctor.
- Excellent lunch, Doctor.

344
00:29:27,492 --> 00:29:30,462
To tell the truth, I sometimes
still miss the conversation...

345
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:33,931
of such gentlemen
as yourself, Doctor.

346
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,867
Well, thank you for your
courtesy and concern, sir.

347
00:29:48,382 --> 00:29:51,180
Fasten your seat belts, gentlemen.

348
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:20,181
Easy with this core. Our M.G. coils
won't take us home without it.

349
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:23,344
Come on, Cookie, out of the way.
You wanna get run over?

350
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:26,514
Handle it gently.
It has to get us home.

351
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:33,228
- Is it far enough away from the ship?
- Sure. No interference there.

352
00:30:33,297 --> 00:30:37,529
- What about the magnetic pull?
- Bosun, drop the thing down over there.

353
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,160
Aye, aye, sir.

354
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:49,045
Where do you wish
the shielding stacked, sir?

355
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:53,051
You can just put it right over
there by the core, thank you.

356
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:56,486
Wait a minute.
That's solid lead he's carrying.

357
00:30:56,556 --> 00:30:59,184
Common lead would have
crushed the vehicle, sir.

358
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:03,356
This is my morning's run
of isotope 217.

359
00:31:03,431 --> 00:31:05,865
The whole thing
hardly comes to ten tons.

360
00:31:07,635 --> 00:31:09,068
Hello, Alta.

361
00:31:09,136 --> 00:31:11,696
Does your father know you're here?

362
00:31:11,772 --> 00:31:15,470
He did tell me not to go near the ship,
but this isn't very near.

363
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:19,413
- Cookie, out of here.
- Aye, aye, sir.

364
00:31:19,481 --> 00:31:21,415
Yes, sir.

365
00:31:33,496 --> 00:31:36,659
Commander, put me down, sir!

366
00:31:37,868 --> 00:31:40,268
- Commander.
- What is it, Chief?

367
00:31:40,337 --> 00:31:42,271
If you'd like
to check my assembly...

368
00:31:42,339 --> 00:31:44,705
for the monitor unit
of the Klystron transmitter...

369
00:31:44,775 --> 00:31:47,744
- What, already?
- Yes, sir.

370
00:31:47,811 --> 00:31:49,404
Excellent.

371
00:31:54,252 --> 00:31:57,517
Are... are these condensers
out of my accelerator circuits?

372
00:31:57,589 --> 00:32:01,287
Yes, sir. I borrowed some solenoids
from your gyrostabilizers too.

373
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,294
Here's the big deal, sir.

374
00:32:03,362 --> 00:32:05,830
I'll bet any quantum mechanic
would give his life...

375
00:32:05,898 --> 00:32:08,093
for a chance to fool around
with this gadget.

376
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:10,101
Get this in the ship by dark.

377
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:13,901
It won't do any good to have some fool
fall on it before we transmit tomorrow.

378
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,908
- Good work, Quinn.
- Thank you, sir.

379
00:32:21,782 --> 00:32:23,944
Come here. Over here.

380
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:33,993
Can I be of service, sir?

381
00:32:34,061 --> 00:32:37,463
Never mind the "sir," but I'm
a stranger in this so-called planet...

382
00:32:37,533 --> 00:32:40,263
and I was just wondering
if you could tell me...

383
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:43,429
where I could get hold
of some of the real stuff.

384
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:47,374
- "Real stuff"?
- Just for cooking purposes.

385
00:32:47,443 --> 00:32:50,503
I take a big pride in my duties.

386
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,208
Pardon me, sir. "Stuff"?

387
00:33:01,325 --> 00:33:05,352
Just about one jolt left.
Oh, genuine Ancient Rocket bourbon.

388
00:33:05,429 --> 00:33:07,829
See here? Hey!

389
00:33:10,402 --> 00:33:14,202
You low-living contraption!
I oughta take a can opener to you!

390
00:33:14,272 --> 00:33:16,968
Quiet, please.
I am analyzing.

391
00:33:21,214 --> 00:33:26,117
Yes, relatively simple alcohol molecules
with traces of fusel oil.

392
00:33:28,521 --> 00:33:31,684
Would 60 gallons be sufficient?

393
00:33:31,757 --> 00:33:34,192
Gallons?

394
00:33:34,261 --> 00:33:37,424
I've been from here to there in
this galaxy, and I want you to know...

395
00:33:37,497 --> 00:33:40,864
you're the most understanding soul
I ever met up with.

396
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:49,573
It's nothing really personal,
just a kiss.

397
00:33:49,644 --> 00:33:52,943
Hmm. But why should people
want to kiss each other?

398
00:33:53,014 --> 00:33:54,879
It's an old custom.

399
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,475
All the really high civilizations
go in for it.

400
00:33:57,553 --> 00:34:00,522
- But it's so silly.
- But it's good for you, though.

401
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:02,853
It stimulates the whole system.

402
00:34:02,925 --> 00:34:05,951
As a matter of fact, you can't
be in tip-top health without it.

403
00:34:06,028 --> 00:34:08,759
Really?
I didn't know that.

404
00:34:08,832 --> 00:34:11,460
I'd be only too happy
to show you.

405
00:34:11,534 --> 00:34:14,094
Well, thank you very much,
Lieutenant.

406
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:16,468
No trouble at all.

407
00:34:25,016 --> 00:34:26,608
Is that all there is to it?

408
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:31,148
Well, you've sort of
got to stick with it.

409
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:43,091
Just once more, do you mind?

410
00:34:43,169 --> 00:34:45,103
Not at all.

411
00:34:51,778 --> 00:34:54,145
There must be something
seriously the matter with me...

412
00:34:54,214 --> 00:34:57,047
because I haven't noticed
the least bit of stimulation.

413
00:34:58,285 --> 00:35:01,686
Honey, let's do this thing right.
Now, here.

414
00:35:16,472 --> 00:35:19,339
Are you giving me the treatment?
Are you?

415
00:35:20,676 --> 00:35:22,610
Lieutenant Farman.

416
00:35:22,678 --> 00:35:24,771
Don't say a word, sir.

417
00:35:24,847 --> 00:35:28,340
I know there are lots of pressing duties
waiting for me back at the ship...

418
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:32,047
and rank doth have
its little privileges, hmm, sir?

419
00:35:32,122 --> 00:35:35,114
And you can depend on it that
those privileges won't be stretched...

420
00:35:35,192 --> 00:35:37,626
into taking your kind of advantages.

421
00:35:37,694 --> 00:35:40,027
- But l...
- Dismissed.

422
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:49,863
What's the matter with him?
Why did you both act so funny?

423
00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:52,843
Well, what'd you expect?

424
00:35:52,911 --> 00:35:55,778
Don't you understand, Alta?

425
00:35:55,848 --> 00:35:59,284
No? Well, look at yourself.

426
00:35:59,351 --> 00:36:04,255
You can't dress like that around men,
especially not a space wolf like Farman.

427
00:36:04,324 --> 00:36:08,624
So for Pete's sake, go home
and put on something that'Il...

428
00:36:08,695 --> 00:36:09,627
Anything.

429
00:36:12,966 --> 00:36:15,697
What's wrong with my clothes?
I designed them myself.

430
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,374
Stop looking at me that way.
I don't think I like it.

431
00:36:23,778 --> 00:36:26,509
What do you mean?

432
00:36:26,581 --> 00:36:29,015
We were just trying to get
some healthy stimulation...

433
00:36:29,084 --> 00:36:31,882
from hugging and kissing,
that's all.

434
00:36:31,953 --> 00:36:35,252
Oh, that's all?
It's so easy for you, isn't it?

435
00:36:35,323 --> 00:36:39,658
There's no feelings, no emotions.
You, uh...

436
00:36:39,729 --> 00:36:42,527
Nothing human would
ever enter your mind.

437
00:36:42,598 --> 00:36:46,193
It so happens that I'm in command
of 18 competitively selected...

438
00:36:46,269 --> 00:36:48,533
super-perfect
physical specimens...

439
00:36:48,604 --> 00:36:51,130
with an average age of 24.6...

440
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:55,872
who have been locked up
in hyperspace for 378 days!

441
00:36:55,946 --> 00:36:59,939
It would have served you right
if I hadn't have... and he...

442
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,682
Get out of here before I have you
run out of the area under guard...

443
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:07,919
and then I'll put
more guards on the guards!

444
00:37:18,137 --> 00:37:21,334
"And then I'll put
more guards on the guards!"

445
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:25,639
I don't like him.
I just don't like him.

446
00:37:25,712 --> 00:37:28,977
The way he kept looking at me.
Then he shouted.

447
00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:32,382
- What about?
- I don't know, really.

448
00:37:32,452 --> 00:37:34,420
It was awful.

449
00:37:34,488 --> 00:37:38,186
I was only trying to be nice
about kissing the lieutenant.

450
00:37:40,261 --> 00:37:43,321
- How did the commander react to that?
- He was furious.

451
00:37:43,397 --> 00:37:46,390
He seemed to think that all that about
biology had something to do with me.

452
00:37:46,468 --> 00:37:49,960
Personally, I mean.
I've never been so nervous in my life.

453
00:37:50,038 --> 00:37:54,168
I hope I don't see him again
if I live to be 400 million!

454
00:37:54,243 --> 00:37:56,803
Well, I daresay
you won't have to.

455
00:37:56,879 --> 00:37:59,007
The best thing you can do
is to go to bed.

456
00:37:59,082 --> 00:38:02,176
I still have some work
to do in my study.

457
00:38:02,252 --> 00:38:04,516
- Good night, my dear.
- Good night.

458
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:31,376
Where have you been?
I've beamed and beamed.

459
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:32,712
Sorry, miss.

460
00:38:32,785 --> 00:38:35,515
I was giving myself an oil job.

461
00:38:35,588 --> 00:38:38,648
And what is it you require
this time, Miss Alta?

462
00:38:38,724 --> 00:38:42,751
Robby, I must have a new dress,
right away.

463
00:38:42,828 --> 00:38:45,423
- Again?
- But this one must be different.

464
00:38:45,499 --> 00:38:49,026
Absolutely nothing must show...
below, above or through.

465
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,035
Radiation-proof?

466
00:38:52,105 --> 00:38:54,869
No, just eye-proof will do.

467
00:38:54,942 --> 00:38:57,343
- Thick and heavy?
- Oh, no, Robby.

468
00:38:57,412 --> 00:39:00,745
It must be the loveliest,
softest thing you've ever made for me...

469
00:39:00,815 --> 00:39:04,683
and fit in all the right places,
with lots and lots of star sapphires.

470
00:39:05,753 --> 00:39:09,281
Star sapphires take a week
to crystallize properly.

471
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:12,020
Would diamonds or emeralds do?

472
00:39:12,094 --> 00:39:14,494
Well, if they're large enough.

473
00:39:14,563 --> 00:39:18,660
Five, ten and fifteen carats,
and on hand.

474
00:39:18,735 --> 00:39:22,000
I will run the dress up for you
in time for breakfast.

475
00:39:25,175 --> 00:39:28,667
- Sleep well, miss.
- Thank you, Robby.

476
00:39:28,745 --> 00:39:31,681
I don't really care now
whether I do or not.

477
00:39:42,995 --> 00:39:46,692
Funny to see two moons
in the sky, isn't it?

478
00:39:46,765 --> 00:39:49,233
Funny how quick
a guy gets used to it.

479
00:39:55,241 --> 00:39:57,709
- Joe.
- What?

480
00:39:57,777 --> 00:40:01,543
- Do you hear something?
- Like what?

481
00:40:01,614 --> 00:40:04,082
Like a sort of big breathing.

482
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,783
That's funny. I did.

483
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:57,872
Strong and Grey, last night during
your watch this ship was entered...

484
00:40:57,942 --> 00:41:01,241
and valuable government property
was sabotaged.

485
00:41:01,312 --> 00:41:04,976
The two of you claim to have
been at your posts and awake.

486
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:07,985
Yet this ship was entered,
the heavy-duty hatch was raised...

487
00:41:08,053 --> 00:41:12,251
and latched back, and neither of you
saw or heard anything.

488
00:41:12,324 --> 00:41:14,793
Except you, Grey.
You heard breathing.

489
00:41:16,129 --> 00:41:19,690
And, Youngerford, let me see,
you were asleep in your bunk...

490
00:41:20,567 --> 00:41:23,900
and you think you had a dream.

491
00:41:24,971 --> 00:41:26,963
A dream!

492
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:31,940
Pending more evidence, you're deprived
of space pay and all privileges.

493
00:41:32,012 --> 00:41:35,846
- Me too, sir?
- No, you'll stand 20 extra watches.

494
00:41:35,916 --> 00:41:38,579
I'll have less dreaming
aboard this ship!

495
00:41:40,055 --> 00:41:41,818
Dismissed!

496
00:41:45,894 --> 00:41:50,195
Half of this gear we can replace
and the rest we can patch up somehow...

497
00:41:50,266 --> 00:41:53,463
except this special
Klystron frequency modulator.

498
00:41:53,536 --> 00:41:56,972
With every facility of the ship,
I think I might be able to rebuild it...

499
00:41:57,039 --> 00:41:59,769
but frankly, the book says no.

500
00:41:59,842 --> 00:42:02,277
It came packed in liquid boron
in a suspended grav...

501
00:42:02,346 --> 00:42:05,440
All right, so it's impossible.
How long will it take?

502
00:42:05,516 --> 00:42:08,110
Well, if I don't
stop for breakfast...

503
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:14,650
- Get on it, Quinn.
- Thank you, sir.

504
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,289
The tractor's ready, sir.

505
00:42:22,367 --> 00:42:26,031
- Wait. I'll put on a clean uniform.
- You'd better stay as you are.

506
00:42:26,105 --> 00:42:28,665
- I'm leaving you in command here.
- Oh, I see.

507
00:42:28,741 --> 00:42:32,074
Establish a standard perimeter
and set up a class "A" alert by sundown.

508
00:42:32,144 --> 00:42:34,135
Aye, aye, sir.

509
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:27,131
Good morning, gentlemen.

510
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:29,900
We'd like to see Dr. Morbius.

511
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:32,306
Morbius is in his study, sir...

512
00:43:32,377 --> 00:43:35,710
never to be disturbed
while that door is closed.

513
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:39,583
All right, we'll wait.

514
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:47,152
Is there any other way
out of there?

515
00:43:47,226 --> 00:43:49,285
This is the only door.

516
00:43:49,362 --> 00:43:53,628
In case you require anything,
gentlemen, use the beamer.

517
00:44:00,007 --> 00:44:02,805
How could he have
slipped past two sentries?

518
00:44:08,182 --> 00:44:10,207
Nothing important, Skipper.

519
00:44:10,285 --> 00:44:13,880
Doc, you stay right there where you are
and keep your eye on that door.

520
00:44:13,955 --> 00:44:17,823
Okay, Skipper. If Morbius comes out,
we'll call you from right here.

521
00:44:33,009 --> 00:44:34,271
Good morning.

522
00:44:34,344 --> 00:44:36,073
Good morning.

523
00:44:44,021 --> 00:44:47,422
- Come on in.
- Didn't bring my bathing suit.

524
00:44:47,491 --> 00:44:50,016
What's a bathing suit?

525
00:44:50,094 --> 00:44:51,959
Oh, murder.

526
00:44:52,029 --> 00:44:55,466
Never mind.
I'm coming out.

527
00:44:57,135 --> 00:44:59,103
Alta, listen.
You mustn't...

528
00:44:59,171 --> 00:45:03,073
You just wait right there.
It'll only take me a second to get dry.

529
00:45:05,945 --> 00:45:10,041
- I'll just turn my back here.
- lf that's the way you feel about it.

530
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:15,817
Don't worry. You're not gonna
have to look at me anymore.

531
00:45:17,558 --> 00:45:19,185
You'll see.

532
00:45:20,461 --> 00:45:23,988
- See what?
- You'll see what.

533
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:29,694
Now wait a minute, Alta.
If you're planning on...

534
00:45:29,771 --> 00:45:34,640
I sure didn't expect to see you today
after the way you spoke to me yesterday.

535
00:45:36,845 --> 00:45:40,179
I'm very sorry about the way
I spoke to you yesterday.

536
00:45:40,249 --> 00:45:42,444
I was sort of bothered.

537
00:45:49,191 --> 00:45:51,956
All right, you can look now.

538
00:45:59,903 --> 00:46:02,532
Nothing shows through, does it?

539
00:46:05,309 --> 00:46:08,005
I had it made
especially for you.

540
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,379
Oh, I thought you weren't
expecting me today.

541
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:14,112
I wasn't.

542
00:46:15,988 --> 00:46:20,049
I guess there's just something
about me personally you don't like.

543
00:46:23,295 --> 00:46:26,288
You always look just beautiful.

544
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,665
Then why don't you kiss me
like everybody else does?

545
00:46:29,736 --> 00:46:31,499
Everybody?

546
00:46:32,605 --> 00:46:34,630
Hasn't your father
taught you anything?

547
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,973
Well, he says
I'm terribly ignorant...

548
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,808
but I have had
poetry and mathematics...

549
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,747
Iogic, physics, geology and bi...

550
00:46:42,817 --> 00:46:44,512
Ology?

551
00:46:44,585 --> 00:46:48,112
Of course, that's mostly
on the theoretical side.

552
00:46:48,189 --> 00:46:50,715
Well, so far.

553
00:46:52,461 --> 00:46:53,985
What's wrong with theory?

554
00:47:04,107 --> 00:47:05,199
This.

555
00:47:33,037 --> 00:47:35,939
It's all right.
He's my friend.

556
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:57,260
I'm sorry, Alta.
I had to do that.

557
00:47:57,330 --> 00:47:59,663
He didn't recognize me.

558
00:47:59,734 --> 00:48:01,998
He would've killed me. Why?

559
00:48:04,472 --> 00:48:08,738
- You really don't know, do you?
- No, I don't.

560
00:48:23,293 --> 00:48:26,524
- Is he still in there?
- Hasn't come out.

561
00:48:28,231 --> 00:48:31,826
Wait a minute, Skipper.
After all, it is his house.

562
00:48:33,671 --> 00:48:35,605
What's the matter?

563
00:48:36,774 --> 00:48:39,607
Doc, something new
has been added.

564
00:48:44,349 --> 00:48:46,977
That's gonna
complicate things a bit.

565
00:49:04,203 --> 00:49:06,194
Not even a window.

566
00:49:06,272 --> 00:49:09,765
The robot lied.
Morbius hasn't been in here.

567
00:49:09,843 --> 00:49:12,038
Doc, he's up to something.

568
00:49:12,112 --> 00:49:14,376
Look at this, Skipper.

569
00:49:16,416 --> 00:49:19,648
- Hieroglyphics?
- Maybe.

570
00:49:19,721 --> 00:49:22,918
But it doesn't look like
Egyptian or cuneiform...

571
00:49:22,991 --> 00:49:24,583
or Chinese.

572
00:49:27,929 --> 00:49:30,364
You'll find the household silver
in the dining room...

573
00:49:30,432 --> 00:49:33,492
and my daughter's jewelry
on her dressing table.

574
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:36,003
Dr. Morbius...

575
00:49:37,706 --> 00:49:41,369
last night our Klystron monitor
was sabotaged.

576
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:45,046
And you suspect me?

577
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:48,141
Then the time has come
for clarification.

578
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:49,810
Sit down.

579
00:49:59,897 --> 00:50:02,388
In times long past...

580
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:06,494
this planet was the home of
a mighty and noble race of beings...

581
00:50:06,571 --> 00:50:09,131
which called themselves the Krell.

582
00:50:09,207 --> 00:50:12,040
Ethically,
as well as technologically...

583
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:15,341
they were a million years
ahead of humankind...

584
00:50:15,414 --> 00:50:18,145
for in unlocking
the mysteries of nature...

585
00:50:18,217 --> 00:50:21,050
they had conquered
even their baser selves...

586
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:24,351
and when, in the course of eons,
they had abolished sickness...

587
00:50:24,424 --> 00:50:27,257
and insanity and crime
and all injustice...

588
00:50:27,327 --> 00:50:29,592
they turned,
still with high benevolence...

589
00:50:29,663 --> 00:50:32,291
outward toward space.

590
00:50:32,366 --> 00:50:36,097
Long before the dawn of man's history,
they had walked our Earth...

591
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:38,502
and brought back
many biological specimens.

592
00:50:38,572 --> 00:50:42,475
I see. That explains
the tiger and the deer.

593
00:50:43,845 --> 00:50:46,075
The heights they had reached...

594
00:50:46,147 --> 00:50:50,744
but then, seemingly on the threshold
of some supreme accomplishment...

595
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:54,119
which was to have crowned
their entire history...

596
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:58,217
this all but divine race
perished in a single night.

597
00:50:59,895 --> 00:51:03,662
In the 2,000 centuries
since that unexplained catastrophe...

598
00:51:03,734 --> 00:51:05,827
even their
cloud-piercing towers...

599
00:51:05,902 --> 00:51:08,632
of glass and porcelain
and adamantine steel...

600
00:51:08,705 --> 00:51:11,640
have crumbled back into
the soil of Altair-4...

601
00:51:11,708 --> 00:51:15,839
and nothing, absolutely nothing
remains above ground.

602
00:51:15,913 --> 00:51:18,473
What were they like?

603
00:51:18,549 --> 00:51:21,780
No record of their
physical nature has survived...

604
00:51:21,853 --> 00:51:26,689
except, perhaps, in the form
of this characteristic arch.

605
00:51:26,759 --> 00:51:29,523
I suggest you consider it
in comparison to one of our...

606
00:51:29,595 --> 00:51:32,496
functionally designed human doorways.

607
00:51:48,482 --> 00:51:52,680
That recording was made by Krell
musicians a half a million years ago.

608
00:51:54,522 --> 00:51:58,891
If you will follow me, I will show you
some of their other remaining artifacts.

609
00:52:15,144 --> 00:52:18,136
Krell metal.
Try your blaster there, Commander.

610
00:52:33,864 --> 00:52:35,628
This spot should be molten.

611
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:39,796
It's not even warm,
and no trace of radioactivity.

612
00:52:39,871 --> 00:52:42,806
The molecules are many times
more densely interlocked...

613
00:52:42,874 --> 00:52:44,865
than in earthly steel...

614
00:52:44,943 --> 00:52:47,071
yet it drinks up energy
like a sponge.

615
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:09,136
This is just one
of their laboratories.

616
00:53:09,203 --> 00:53:12,036
You will notice that much
of the equipment is familiar...

617
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:14,666
though designed
for nonhuman technicians.

618
00:53:22,651 --> 00:53:23,879
What's this?

619
00:53:26,522 --> 00:53:28,490
On this screen
may be projected...

620
00:53:28,557 --> 00:53:30,923
the total scientific knowledge
of the Krell...

621
00:53:30,993 --> 00:53:34,327
from its primitive beginning
to the day of its annihilation...

622
00:53:34,397 --> 00:53:38,026
a sheer bulk surpassing
many million earthly libraries.

623
00:53:38,101 --> 00:53:41,093
- You're able to read this?
- A little. It's my profession.

624
00:53:42,305 --> 00:53:44,797
Twenty years ago,
I began here with...

625
00:53:44,875 --> 00:53:46,900
this page
of geometrical theorems.

626
00:53:46,977 --> 00:53:51,073
Eventually I was able to deduce
most of their huge, logical alphabet.

627
00:53:51,148 --> 00:53:52,547
I began to learn.

628
00:53:52,616 --> 00:53:55,313
The first practical result
was my robot...

629
00:53:55,387 --> 00:53:58,322
which you gentlemen
appear to find so remarkable.

630
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:00,358
Child's play.

631
00:54:00,425 --> 00:54:02,655
I've come here every day now
for two decades...

632
00:54:02,727 --> 00:54:06,960
painfully picking up a few of the least
difficult fragments of their knowledge.

633
00:54:07,033 --> 00:54:10,560
A thing like this,
it's too big to evaluate.

634
00:54:10,636 --> 00:54:12,604
Think what a discovery of this kind...

635
00:54:12,672 --> 00:54:14,902
what is this device over here?

636
00:54:14,974 --> 00:54:18,034
I call it
their "plastic educator."

637
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:22,707
As far as I can make out, they used it
to condition and test their young...

638
00:54:22,783 --> 00:54:25,775
in much the same way
as we once employed finger-painting...

639
00:54:25,886 --> 00:54:27,444
among our kindergarten children.

640
00:54:27,521 --> 00:54:30,320
I often play with it myself
for relaxation...

641
00:54:30,391 --> 00:54:33,087
although working here,
I sometimes wish I'd been blessed...

642
00:54:33,161 --> 00:54:35,129
with multiple arms and legs.

643
00:54:36,631 --> 00:54:38,565
Now, you can see
that this headset...

644
00:54:38,633 --> 00:54:42,035
was designed for something
much bulkier than my human cranium.

645
00:54:47,343 --> 00:54:50,005
Now, over here you see...

646
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,673
the electromagnetic waves
of my brain...

647
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:55,377
sending that indicator up
about halfway.

648
00:54:56,519 --> 00:54:59,955
I gather that
one of their own young...

649
00:55:00,023 --> 00:55:02,116
comparable to
a seven-year-old child...

650
00:55:02,192 --> 00:55:05,060
was normally expected to send that
all the way to the top...

651
00:55:05,129 --> 00:55:08,758
which by Krell standards
classifies me as a low-grade moron.

652
00:55:08,833 --> 00:55:12,030
Yet I have
an officially recorded IQ of 183.

653
00:55:13,337 --> 00:55:15,737
Now then, for the primary function.

654
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:20,505
Actually, to operate...

655
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:25,243
Well, I'll choose a familiar subject
to start with to save time.

656
00:55:32,659 --> 00:55:34,126
There now, gentlemen.

657
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:40,791
What's that?

658
00:55:40,868 --> 00:55:42,301
What's happening there?

659
00:55:48,008 --> 00:55:49,441
A statue.

660
00:55:54,949 --> 00:55:56,280
That's Altaira.

661
00:55:56,351 --> 00:55:59,081
Simply a three-dimensional image,
Commander.

662
00:55:59,154 --> 00:56:00,587
But it's alive!

663
00:56:00,655 --> 00:56:05,252
Because my daughter is alive in my brain
from microsecond to microsecond...

664
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:06,852
while I manipulate.

665
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:10,064
There.

666
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:12,867
Something of a strain.

667
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:17,130
Aladdin's lamp
in a physics laboratory.

668
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,142
Would you gentlemen care to take
the Krell test of your intelligence?

669
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:23,043
- Yes, very much.
- You may be disappointed, Commander.

670
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:25,878
Suppose we start
with the good doctor.

671
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:28,748
- What do I do?
- Just sit down there, and I'Il...

672
00:56:30,121 --> 00:56:31,816
Move forward.

673
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,652
There now.

674
00:56:33,725 --> 00:56:36,923
Now, Doctor,
you can read it here.

675
00:56:36,995 --> 00:56:38,519
There's something wrong here.

676
00:56:39,598 --> 00:56:41,862
I have an IQ of 161...

677
00:56:41,934 --> 00:56:45,563
yet I don't register
a third what you did.

678
00:56:45,637 --> 00:56:47,298
Now the commander.

679
00:57:01,555 --> 00:57:04,820
It's all right, sir. A commanding
officer doesn't need brains.

680
00:57:04,892 --> 00:57:07,053
Just a good loud voice, huh?

681
00:57:07,128 --> 00:57:09,062
Do I pull this switch
to make an image?

682
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:10,757
Stop! You'd never survive.

683
00:57:10,831 --> 00:57:15,826
Our Belerephon skipper tried it,
and it was instantly fatal to him.

684
00:57:15,904 --> 00:57:20,170
Oh, I see.
So you're immune to this too?

685
00:57:20,242 --> 00:57:23,007
In my first attempt
at creating an image here...

686
00:57:23,079 --> 00:57:26,515
my brain pattern there
was scarcely any larger than yours.

687
00:57:26,582 --> 00:57:28,948
Afterwards, I lay unconscious
for a day and a night.

688
00:57:30,052 --> 00:57:32,520
Yet you came back
for a second go at it.

689
00:57:33,689 --> 00:57:35,954
It was a question
of science, Doctor...

690
00:57:36,026 --> 00:57:39,257
but you can imagine my joy
when I discovered that the shock...

691
00:57:39,329 --> 00:57:44,266
had permanently doubled
my intellectual capacity.

692
00:57:44,334 --> 00:57:48,271
Otherwise, my researches here
would have come to nothing...

693
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:50,273
poor as they have been.

694
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:56,074
Recently I have turned up
some rather puzzling indications...

695
00:57:56,147 --> 00:57:59,413
that in those final days
before their annihilation...

696
00:57:59,485 --> 00:58:02,420
the Krell had been applying
their entire racial energies...

697
00:58:02,488 --> 00:58:04,080
to a new project...

698
00:58:04,156 --> 00:58:06,420
one which they actually
seemed to hope...

699
00:58:06,492 --> 00:58:09,485
might somehow free them
once and for all...

700
00:58:09,563 --> 00:58:13,499
from any dependence
on physical instrumentalities.

701
00:58:13,567 --> 00:58:15,501
A civilization
without instrumentalities?

702
00:58:15,569 --> 00:58:16,763
Incredible.

703
00:58:16,837 --> 00:58:20,238
Dr. Morbius,
everything here is new.

704
00:58:20,307 --> 00:58:23,243
Not a sign of age or wear
on any of it.

705
00:58:23,311 --> 00:58:28,044
Young man, these devices,
self-serviced, self-maintained...

706
00:58:28,115 --> 00:58:32,314
have stood exactly as you see them
for 2,000 centuries.

707
00:58:32,387 --> 00:58:34,218
2,000 centuries?

708
00:58:34,289 --> 00:58:37,224
And during all this time,
what was their power source?

709
00:58:37,292 --> 00:58:39,226
That's a good question.

710
00:58:39,294 --> 00:58:42,286
May I draw your attention
to these gauges...

711
00:58:42,364 --> 00:58:44,333
all around here, gentlemen?

712
00:58:45,468 --> 00:58:47,402
Their calibrations
appear to indicate...

713
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:49,597
that they are set
in decimal series...

714
00:58:49,672 --> 00:58:52,607
each division recording
exactly ten times as many amperes...

715
00:58:52,675 --> 00:58:54,609
as the one preceding it.

716
00:58:54,677 --> 00:58:56,578
Ten times ten
times ten times ten...

717
00:58:56,647 --> 00:58:59,172
times ten times ten,
on and on and on...

718
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:02,344
row after row,
gauge after gauge.

719
00:59:02,419 --> 00:59:05,820
But there is no direct wiring
that I can discover.

720
00:59:06,992 --> 00:59:09,460
However, when I
activate this machine...

721
00:59:09,528 --> 00:59:11,621
it registers infinitesimally,
you see...

722
00:59:11,696 --> 00:59:14,221
down there in the lower
left-hand corner.

723
00:59:14,299 --> 00:59:16,597
And then...

724
00:59:16,668 --> 00:59:20,070
when I activate
the educator here...

725
00:59:22,041 --> 00:59:24,566
it registers a little more.

726
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:27,738
But this much is negligible.

727
00:59:27,813 --> 00:59:31,511
The total potential here must be
nothing less than astronomical.

728
00:59:31,585 --> 00:59:32,847
Nothing less.

729
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:36,219
The number ten
raised almost literally...

730
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:38,224
to the power of infinity.

731
00:59:40,093 --> 00:59:43,825
Gentlemen, would you care to see
some more of the Krell wonders?

732
00:59:43,898 --> 00:59:46,059
- Indeed, yes.
- Yes.

733
00:59:46,134 --> 00:59:49,160
If you will,
step in this shuttle car.

734
01:00:03,686 --> 01:00:06,781
How often the Krell technicians
have ridden in this little vehicle.

735
01:00:08,758 --> 01:00:10,817
What now, Dr. Morbius?

736
01:00:10,894 --> 01:00:12,828
Prepare your minds
for a new scale...

737
01:00:12,896 --> 01:00:15,194
of physical scientific values,
gentlemen.

738
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:06,253
Twenty miles.

739
01:01:07,489 --> 01:01:09,013
Twenty miles.

740
01:01:11,059 --> 01:01:12,390
Listen.

741
01:01:13,996 --> 01:01:15,588
Circuits opening and closing.

742
01:01:15,665 --> 01:01:19,157
And they never rest. This is
one of their ventilator shafts.

743
01:01:19,235 --> 01:01:23,001
You can feel the warm air rising.
Look down here.

744
01:01:23,072 --> 01:01:25,041
Look down, gentlemen.
Are you afraid?

745
01:01:36,888 --> 01:01:39,288
7,800 levels.

746
01:01:47,732 --> 01:01:51,692
And 400 other shafts
like this one.

747
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,167
Yes, a single machine.

748
01:02:27,242 --> 01:02:30,905
A cube 20 miles on each side.

749
01:02:30,979 --> 01:02:34,882
For 2,000 centuries
it has waited patiently here...

750
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:39,251
tuning and lubricating itself,
replacing worn parts.

751
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:41,688
I have reason to believe
that 16 years ago...

752
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,692
a minor alteration was performed...

753
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,492
throughout the entire 8,000 cubic miles
of its own fabric.

754
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,594
But what's it all for?

755
01:02:52,669 --> 01:02:54,864
Sometimes the gauges
register a little...

756
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:58,431
when the buck deer fight in the autumn
or when birds fly over in the spring...

757
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:00,501
and nearly a whole dial
became active...

758
01:03:00,578 --> 01:03:03,775
when your ship first approached
from deep space.

759
01:03:03,848 --> 01:03:06,783
I'll show you a section
of one of the power units.

760
01:03:08,888 --> 01:03:12,722
These units are sunk
in the body of the planet...

761
01:03:12,792 --> 01:03:15,386
fifty miles
right below our feet.

762
01:03:15,461 --> 01:03:18,555
Now, be sure and look
only in the mirror.

763
01:03:18,631 --> 01:03:21,567
Man does not behold
the face of the Gorgon and live.

764
01:03:30,377 --> 01:03:33,506
9,200 thermonuclear reactors
in tandem.

765
01:03:34,682 --> 01:03:38,083
The harnessed power
of an exploding planetary system.

766
01:03:46,728 --> 01:03:49,060
All hands, stand clear
of fence area.

767
01:03:49,131 --> 01:03:51,099
All right, Quinn, turn it on.

768
01:03:53,101 --> 01:03:55,662
- Have you tested it yet, Bosun?
- Right away, sir.

769
01:04:05,481 --> 01:04:07,450
- There you are, sir.
- Very good.

770
01:04:12,456 --> 01:04:16,392
Lieutenant? Having completed
my washing-up duties after chow...

771
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:18,895
I request the lieutenant's permission
to take a walk...

772
01:04:18,964 --> 01:04:20,898
outside the perimeter, sir.

773
01:04:20,966 --> 01:04:23,366
- There's nothing out there.
- But there is, sir.

774
01:04:23,435 --> 01:04:27,371
I mean... well, I thought it might
brighten the boys' mess up a bit...

775
01:04:27,439 --> 01:04:32,377
if I could find a few
wild radishes or something.

776
01:04:32,445 --> 01:04:35,209
I don't know what you're lying about,
but you better get back...

777
01:04:35,281 --> 01:04:37,545
before the skipper does,
or we'll both be skinned.

778
01:04:37,617 --> 01:04:40,279
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

779
01:04:40,353 --> 01:04:43,551
Quinn, this is Farman.
Kill the power on the fence.

780
01:04:46,793 --> 01:04:48,761
All right, put it back on.

781
01:05:06,949 --> 01:05:09,577
480 pints...

782
01:05:09,652 --> 01:05:11,176
as you requested.

783
01:05:12,421 --> 01:05:15,083
Total: 60 gallons.

784
01:05:15,157 --> 01:05:17,092
Genuine Kansas City bourbon!

785
01:05:22,866 --> 01:05:24,356
It's smooth too.

786
01:05:33,044 --> 01:05:35,535
Robby, I ain't never
gonna forget this.

787
01:05:35,613 --> 01:05:38,582
Any time you're hard up
for lube oil, let me know.

788
01:05:45,357 --> 01:05:47,291
What's up?
Somebody coming this way?

789
01:05:49,094 --> 01:05:52,030
No, sir.
Nothing coming this way.

790
01:05:58,972 --> 01:06:00,633
The fence is shorting!

791
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:08,514
Shall I shut down
the current, sir?

792
01:06:08,582 --> 01:06:11,483
No. It's stopped now.

793
01:06:11,552 --> 01:06:13,817
Check over the whole system
in the morning.

794
01:06:13,888 --> 01:06:15,150
Aye, sir.

795
01:06:57,301 --> 01:07:00,328
It's strange how that fence
just shorted out.

796
01:07:11,317 --> 01:07:13,080
You're too arbitrary, Commander.

797
01:07:13,153 --> 01:07:16,316
Perhaps I do not choose to be
dictated to in my own world.

798
01:07:16,389 --> 01:07:19,358
Dr. Morbius, a scientific find
of this magnitude...

799
01:07:19,426 --> 01:07:21,860
has got to be taken
under United Planet supervision.

800
01:07:21,928 --> 01:07:23,988
No one man can be allowed
to monopolize it.

801
01:07:24,065 --> 01:07:26,090
For the past two hours
I've been expecting you...

802
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:28,260
to make exactly
that asinine statement.

803
01:07:28,335 --> 01:07:30,269
Just one moment, Commander.

804
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:32,828
For close on 20 years now
I've been constantly...

805
01:07:32,907 --> 01:07:36,241
and I hope dispassionately,
considering this very problem...

806
01:07:36,311 --> 01:07:38,336
and I have come
to the unalterable conclusion...

807
01:07:38,413 --> 01:07:41,439
that man is unfit as yet
to receive such knowledge...

808
01:07:41,516 --> 01:07:43,882
such almost limitless power.

809
01:07:43,952 --> 01:07:47,787
Whereas Morbius, with his
artificially expanded intellect...

810
01:07:47,857 --> 01:07:51,520
is now ideally suited to administer
this power for the whole human race.

811
01:07:51,594 --> 01:07:53,084
Precisely, Doctor.

812
01:07:53,162 --> 01:07:54,925
Such portions then
of the Krell science...

813
01:07:54,997 --> 01:07:57,523
as I may, from time to time,
deem suitable and safe...

814
01:07:57,601 --> 01:07:59,364
I shall dispense to Earth.

815
01:07:59,436 --> 01:08:01,427
Other portions,
I shall withhold.

816
01:08:01,505 --> 01:08:04,167
And in this, I shall be
answerable exclusively...

817
01:08:04,241 --> 01:08:06,232
to my own conscience
and judgment.

818
01:08:07,311 --> 01:08:09,712
Dr. Morbius, in the absence
of special instructions...

819
01:08:09,781 --> 01:08:11,715
you leave me
in a very awkward position.

820
01:08:13,151 --> 01:08:15,779
- Commander Adams.
- Speaking, Lieutenant.

821
01:08:15,854 --> 01:08:17,845
Skipper, the chief's
been murdered.

822
01:08:19,124 --> 01:08:20,387
Quinn? Murdered?

823
01:08:20,459 --> 01:08:22,393
Yes, he was alone,
working on the monitor.

824
01:08:22,461 --> 01:08:24,986
The rest of us were outside
on guard duty. l...

825
01:08:25,064 --> 01:08:27,328
- How was it done?
- "Done"?

826
01:08:27,399 --> 01:08:30,334
Skipper, his body is plastered
all over the communications room.

827
01:08:31,537 --> 01:08:33,472
Leave everything as it is.
We're on our way.

828
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:53,993
It's started again.

829
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:03,537
Is that it?

830
01:09:03,605 --> 01:09:07,372
I tried to make a plaster model
from the footprints we found.

831
01:09:12,115 --> 01:09:14,140
37 inches by 19.

832
01:09:16,386 --> 01:09:18,321
Why, it's fantastic.

833
01:09:21,058 --> 01:09:22,582
Doc, I don't understand.

834
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:25,925
Whatever walks on this would be quite
an opponent for a man with a club...

835
01:09:25,996 --> 01:09:27,964
but with our weapons,
Quinn could have...

836
01:09:28,032 --> 01:09:33,437
No. This thing runs counter to
every known law of adaptive evolution.

837
01:09:33,505 --> 01:09:34,938
What do you mean?

838
01:09:36,208 --> 01:09:37,869
Notice this structure here.

839
01:09:38,977 --> 01:09:41,947
Characteristic
of a four-footed animal.

840
01:09:42,014 --> 01:09:44,915
Yet our visitor last night
left the tracks of a biped.

841
01:09:46,485 --> 01:09:49,010
Primarily a ground animal too.

842
01:09:49,088 --> 01:09:52,080
Yet this claw could only belong
to an arboreal creature...

843
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:55,925
like some impossible tree sloth.

844
01:09:55,996 --> 01:09:58,863
Just doesn't fit into normal nature
anywhere in the galaxy.

845
01:09:58,932 --> 01:10:00,399
This is a nightmare.

846
01:10:00,467 --> 01:10:02,662
Is that what you made
out of that footprint?

847
01:10:02,736 --> 01:10:04,705
I think it's fairly close.

848
01:10:06,107 --> 01:10:09,406
Pardon me, Commander. Are you ready
to hold discipline on the cook, sir?

849
01:10:09,477 --> 01:10:11,604
Yeah, let's have him.

850
01:10:15,416 --> 01:10:19,410
I'm obliged to remind you that I gave
him permission to go out last night.

851
01:10:19,488 --> 01:10:21,752
Did you give him permission
to get falling-down drunk?

852
01:10:21,824 --> 01:10:23,314
Drunk, sir? Me, sir?

853
01:10:23,392 --> 01:10:25,326
Ask Dr. Ostrow, sir.

854
01:10:25,394 --> 01:10:28,228
Four pints of 120 proof bourbon
without a trace of hangover in it.

855
01:10:28,298 --> 01:10:30,061
That ain't natural.

856
01:10:30,133 --> 01:10:34,729
Besides, why did that Robert argue me
into drinking all that whiskey?

857
01:10:34,804 --> 01:10:36,533
You were with the robot last night?

858
01:10:36,606 --> 01:10:38,164
Yes, sir.

859
01:10:38,241 --> 01:10:41,439
Him and me, we kind of got to
toasting each other's good health...

860
01:10:41,512 --> 01:10:44,481
just for cordial interplanetary
relations, you understand.

861
01:10:44,548 --> 01:10:48,484
Now, that's all the time?
Even while the chief was being killed?

862
01:10:48,552 --> 01:10:50,214
Certainly, sir.

863
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:53,315
I hope you don't think I got
that stiff in five minutes.

864
01:10:55,994 --> 01:10:57,427
All right. Dismissed.

865
01:11:03,336 --> 01:11:06,032
I guess that kind of
washes the robot up.

866
01:11:06,105 --> 01:11:08,039
Where does that leave us
for suspects?

867
01:11:08,107 --> 01:11:10,473
Maybe it leaves us
with the same one.

868
01:11:10,543 --> 01:11:12,977
Maybe we should drop over
to that Krell laboratory...

869
01:11:13,046 --> 01:11:15,515
and get our IQs boosted
a couple of hundred percent.

870
01:11:15,582 --> 01:11:17,516
Sir, burial detail is ready.

871
01:11:20,688 --> 01:11:23,714
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

872
01:11:27,862 --> 01:11:29,853
- Dismissed.
- Company, dismissed.

873
01:11:40,142 --> 01:11:41,268
Fine technician.

874
01:11:43,179 --> 01:11:45,170
Good shipmate.

875
01:11:45,247 --> 01:11:47,545
That's a good epitaph
for any man.

876
01:11:54,591 --> 01:11:56,525
Good day, Dr. Morbius.

877
01:11:56,593 --> 01:11:59,654
I daresay neither of us
slept any last night.

878
01:11:59,731 --> 01:12:01,892
That's a pretty close guess.

879
01:12:01,966 --> 01:12:04,901
I warned you while your ship
was still in space.

880
01:12:04,969 --> 01:12:07,802
I begged you not to land
on this planet.

881
01:12:07,872 --> 01:12:11,604
Believe me, Commander,
that is only a foretaste.

882
01:12:11,677 --> 01:12:14,077
The Belerephon pattern
is being woven again.

883
01:12:15,514 --> 01:12:19,678
Remain here and the next attack
on your party...

884
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:24,213
will be more deadly and general.

885
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:26,258
How do you know that?

886
01:12:28,328 --> 01:12:30,523
Know? l...

887
01:12:30,597 --> 01:12:33,122
I seem to visualize it.

888
01:12:36,003 --> 01:12:38,062
If you wish, call it...

889
01:12:39,573 --> 01:12:41,507
a premonition.

890
01:12:56,425 --> 01:12:58,394
What do you make of that, Skipper?

891
01:12:58,461 --> 01:13:00,588
I'd say it sounded
like an ultimatum.

892
01:13:01,697 --> 01:13:03,130
- Bosun.
- Aye, sir.

893
01:13:07,637 --> 01:13:10,368
Bosun. I want a clear field
of fire in all directions.

894
01:13:10,441 --> 01:13:12,375
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Randall?

895
01:13:12,443 --> 01:13:14,377
How soon will radar
be operational?

896
01:13:14,445 --> 01:13:17,039
- Operating right now, sir.
- Good. Keep on it yourself.

897
01:13:17,114 --> 01:13:19,810
- Aye, aye, sir.
- The M.A. alert is completed?

898
01:13:19,883 --> 01:13:22,614
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Fine.

899
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:24,279
Activate main batteries.

900
01:13:30,628 --> 01:13:32,187
Alarm for test.

901
01:13:39,905 --> 01:13:41,167
Fire!

902
01:13:53,286 --> 01:13:54,879
Check good.

903
01:13:59,961 --> 01:14:02,293
Lieutenant, you got
your trouble squad in hand?

904
01:14:02,363 --> 01:14:04,797
Yes, sir, but they're
a little trigger-happy.

905
01:14:04,866 --> 01:14:07,335
They're sort of edgy
to see whatever's out there.

906
01:14:09,104 --> 01:14:10,366
Oh, Jerry.

907
01:14:14,209 --> 01:14:17,144
This may be a big deal coming up.

908
01:14:18,748 --> 01:14:20,841
I'm sorry if I've leaned on you...

909
01:14:20,917 --> 01:14:24,876
Stop knocking yourself out, Skipper.
She picked the right man.

910
01:14:28,758 --> 01:14:30,920
- What is it, Randall?
- Radar just picked up something.

911
01:14:30,995 --> 01:14:32,929
- Where away?
- At the head of the arroyo.

912
01:14:32,997 --> 01:14:34,931
- Moving?
- This way. Slowly.

913
01:14:42,207 --> 01:14:43,640
Automatic control.

914
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:51,380
Batteries, fire!

915
01:14:55,922 --> 01:14:57,856
Batteries, hold fire.

916
01:14:58,925 --> 01:15:00,916
Do you see anything out there?

917
01:15:02,028 --> 01:15:03,461
Nothing.

918
01:15:05,265 --> 01:15:07,733
Batteries, fire!

919
01:15:12,372 --> 01:15:14,306
Batteries, cease fire.

920
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:17,606
- Randall.
- Dead on target, sir.

921
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,169
Good.

922
01:15:19,247 --> 01:15:21,511
- Give me audio-com.
- Aye, aye, sir.

923
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:23,175
Attention!

924
01:15:23,251 --> 01:15:26,311
This may have been a ruse to divert us
from some other part of the perimeter.

925
01:15:26,387 --> 01:15:28,720
Continue watching
on your own immediate fronts.

926
01:15:28,791 --> 01:15:30,258
That is all.

927
01:15:36,765 --> 01:15:37,925
What?

928
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,935
It just stopped
at the foot of the pass.

929
01:15:40,003 --> 01:15:41,937
Are you sure you've got
a real blip there?

930
01:15:42,005 --> 01:15:45,099
Big as a house, and we were
on target with both bursts.

931
01:15:45,175 --> 01:15:46,938
It's coming on again!

932
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:49,035
- Straight across?
- It shows here.

933
01:15:49,946 --> 01:15:51,380
It's still coming!

934
01:15:51,449 --> 01:15:53,713
Gray, Strong, set up
a cross fire on those rocks.

935
01:16:28,856 --> 01:16:30,790
Fire!

936
01:16:32,693 --> 01:16:34,627
The blasted thing's invisible!

937
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:21,504
Jerry! Hold fire!

938
01:17:30,689 --> 01:17:31,951
Fire!

939
01:17:56,784 --> 01:17:58,616
Father!

940
01:17:58,687 --> 01:18:00,655
Alta!

941
01:18:04,926 --> 01:18:06,860
- Alta, where are you?
- Father!

942
01:18:06,928 --> 01:18:08,863
What is it?
What's the matter?

943
01:18:08,931 --> 01:18:11,263
I just had a terrible dream!

944
01:18:11,334 --> 01:18:13,734
There was blood and fire
and thunder...

945
01:18:13,803 --> 01:18:17,364
and something awful was moving
in the middle of it.

946
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:19,874
I could hear it roar and bellow.

947
01:18:19,943 --> 01:18:22,104
Now, now. You know
a dream can't hurt you.

948
01:18:22,179 --> 01:18:24,909
Not me. Not us.

949
01:18:24,982 --> 01:18:27,143
The thing I saw was trying
to break in the camp.

950
01:18:27,217 --> 01:18:29,310
It was gonna kill...

951
01:18:29,386 --> 01:18:33,016
You'll take care of him for me,
won't you? You'll protect him.

952
01:18:33,091 --> 01:18:38,393
My darling, I'm completely helpless
as long as he remains here so willfully.

953
01:18:38,463 --> 01:18:39,725
Come now.

954
01:18:49,542 --> 01:18:51,476
- Bosun.
- Yes, sir?

955
01:18:54,748 --> 01:18:56,739
Get those graves dug.
Keep the men busy.

956
01:18:56,817 --> 01:18:58,751
- The busier the better.
- Randall?

957
01:19:00,086 --> 01:19:01,519
Give me audio-com.

958
01:19:03,690 --> 01:19:07,183
Well, men, whatever it was,
our main battery stopped it.

959
01:19:08,963 --> 01:19:10,487
You believe that?

960
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,691
No, it just went away
for some reason. It'll be back.

961
01:19:16,704 --> 01:19:19,640
Doc, an invisible being...

962
01:19:19,708 --> 01:19:22,108
that cannot be disintegrated
by atomic fission.

963
01:19:23,612 --> 01:19:27,048
No, Skipper. That is
a scientific impossibility.

964
01:19:27,115 --> 01:19:29,710
Hypnotic illusions
don't tear people apart.

965
01:19:29,786 --> 01:19:31,651
That's true enough...

966
01:19:31,721 --> 01:19:35,657
but any organism dense enough to
survive three billion electron volts...

967
01:19:35,725 --> 01:19:39,923
would have to be made
of solid nuclear material.

968
01:19:39,996 --> 01:19:42,056
It would sink of its own weight
to the center of this planet.

969
01:19:42,132 --> 01:19:45,033
You saw it yourself standing there
in those neutron beams.

970
01:19:45,102 --> 01:19:46,569
There's your answer.

971
01:19:46,637 --> 01:19:48,901
It must have been renewing
its molecular structure...

972
01:19:48,973 --> 01:19:50,907
from one microsecond
to the next.

973
01:19:55,013 --> 01:19:58,710
- Bosun! I want the tractor.
- Ready, sir.

974
01:19:58,783 --> 01:20:01,775
We pick up the girl and her father
whether they like it or not.

975
01:20:01,853 --> 01:20:03,150
Section 86A:

976
01:20:03,221 --> 01:20:05,690
"Evacuate all civilians
from disaster areas."

977
01:20:05,758 --> 01:20:08,318
You left out
two very important words.

978
01:20:08,394 --> 01:20:09,918
"Where feasible."

979
01:20:09,996 --> 01:20:13,090
If you remember
the Belerephon expedition...

980
01:20:13,165 --> 01:20:15,099
their ship was vaporized
trying to lift off.

981
01:20:15,167 --> 01:20:18,399
Which makes it a gilt-edged priority
that one of us...

982
01:20:18,472 --> 01:20:21,134
gets into that Krell lab
and takes that brain boost.

983
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:25,134
- Bosun.
- Aye, sir?

984
01:20:27,415 --> 01:20:29,679
I'm leaving you in command.
Get the ship operational.

985
01:20:29,751 --> 01:20:32,345
Do your best to wait it out
for me and the doctor...

986
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:35,412
but the second that fence starts
to short again, lift off...

987
01:20:35,490 --> 01:20:38,927
and report back to Earth base
on conditions in this sector.

988
01:20:38,994 --> 01:20:40,427
Right, Skipper.

989
01:20:52,676 --> 01:20:56,442
All right. Get everything
aboard ship. We're pullin' out!

990
01:21:19,871 --> 01:21:21,304
No lights showing.

991
01:21:25,545 --> 01:21:29,276
Look, Doc, in case
we make it into that lab...

992
01:21:29,349 --> 01:21:31,340
I'll take the first go
at the IQ booster.

993
01:21:33,052 --> 01:21:34,485
You hear me?

994
01:21:34,554 --> 01:21:35,987
I hear you.

995
01:21:52,273 --> 01:21:55,640
I am monitored to admit no one
at this hour.

996
01:21:58,913 --> 01:22:00,347
That sounded final.

997
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:05,019
Maybe if we reasoned with him.

998
01:22:11,495 --> 01:22:14,794
My beams are focused
on your blasters, gentlemen.

999
01:22:24,776 --> 01:22:28,212
Hasn't he got a built-in rule
against wringing our necks for us?

1000
01:22:29,647 --> 01:22:31,205
That is true, sir.

1001
01:22:31,282 --> 01:22:34,218
Yet I am monitored
to admit no one.

1002
01:22:38,357 --> 01:22:40,985
- Let them in.
- This is your father's order.

1003
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:43,255
- Get out of the way.
- Quiet.

1004
01:22:45,498 --> 01:22:48,626
Emergency cancellation Archimedes.

1005
01:22:54,808 --> 01:22:56,400
Why are you here?

1006
01:22:58,913 --> 01:23:00,380
We were attacked.

1007
01:23:00,448 --> 01:23:02,712
Three more men dead,
including Jerry Farman.

1008
01:23:11,426 --> 01:23:13,360
I don't know.
It was...

1009
01:23:13,428 --> 01:23:17,194
just some kind of big outline
in the disintegrator beams.

1010
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:19,962
And you can't explain it?

1011
01:23:23,005 --> 01:23:25,599
Well, anyway, we fought it,
and we lost.

1012
01:23:25,675 --> 01:23:28,906
- I figure it'll be back.
- You must leave, now.

1013
01:23:28,978 --> 01:23:30,673
I'm not going without you.

1014
01:23:30,746 --> 01:23:33,910
But I can't possibly leave him alone.
I just can't.

1015
01:23:33,984 --> 01:23:36,179
- Then we'll take him.
- By force?

1016
01:23:36,253 --> 01:23:38,187
I can't agree to that either.

1017
01:23:38,255 --> 01:23:41,190
Can't you? You don't realize
what's loose on this planet!

1018
01:23:41,258 --> 01:23:43,227
But I'm immune,
like both my parents.

1019
01:23:43,294 --> 01:23:45,524
That's what he says.
Nothing could be immune to that thing...

1020
01:23:45,597 --> 01:23:47,963
Oh, darling, please go.

1021
01:23:54,205 --> 01:23:56,504
Oh, please.
If you love me, go.

1022
01:23:56,575 --> 01:24:00,978
Alta. Doc, will you talk
some sense to this girl?

1023
01:24:01,046 --> 01:24:03,446
I'm in over my head. Doc?

1024
01:24:04,650 --> 01:24:05,912
Doc?

1025
01:24:10,524 --> 01:24:12,458
On the sofa, Robby.

1026
01:24:23,905 --> 01:24:25,839
So you took the brain boost, huh?

1027
01:24:26,841 --> 01:24:28,866
You oughta see my new mind.

1028
01:24:30,212 --> 01:24:33,375
Up there in lights.
Bigger than his now.

1029
01:24:35,117 --> 01:24:37,142
Easy, Doc.

1030
01:24:37,219 --> 01:24:40,484
Morbius was too close
to the problem.

1031
01:24:41,824 --> 01:24:43,951
The Krell had completed their project.

1032
01:24:45,094 --> 01:24:46,891
That big machine.

1033
01:24:46,963 --> 01:24:48,453
No instrumentalities.

1034
01:24:49,599 --> 01:24:51,089
True creation.

1035
01:24:52,236 --> 01:24:53,863
Doc, let's have it.

1036
01:24:53,938 --> 01:24:56,463
- But the Krell forgot one thing.
- Yes, what?

1037
01:24:57,942 --> 01:24:59,375
Monsters, John.

1038
01:25:00,511 --> 01:25:02,706
Monsters from the Id.

1039
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:04,874
The Id? What's that?

1040
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:06,383
Talk, Doc.

1041
01:25:10,956 --> 01:25:12,218
Doc?

1042
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:36,281
How romantic!

1043
01:25:41,155 --> 01:25:43,749
The fool!
The meddling idiot!

1044
01:25:43,825 --> 01:25:46,953
As though his ape's brain
could contain the secrets of the Krell.

1045
01:25:48,763 --> 01:25:51,232
Father, he's dead.

1046
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:53,996
He was warned,
and now he's paid.

1047
01:25:54,069 --> 01:25:57,698
Let him be buried with the other victims
of human greed and folly.

1048
01:26:03,513 --> 01:26:07,313
Morbius, you wanted me
to make a choice.

1049
01:26:08,685 --> 01:26:10,516
Now you've chosen for me.

1050
01:26:11,254 --> 01:26:13,314
I'm ready to go with you, darling.

1051
01:26:15,393 --> 01:26:17,452
I will place him
in the tractor, sir.

1052
01:26:17,528 --> 01:26:18,961
Thank you.

1053
01:26:20,197 --> 01:26:22,188
She mustn't do this.
She must be prevented.

1054
01:26:22,266 --> 01:26:24,029
Morbius, what is the Id?

1055
01:26:24,101 --> 01:26:28,061
My daughter is planning a very foolish
action, and she'll be terribly punished.

1056
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:30,472
- What is the Id?
- Id! Id! Id!

1057
01:26:33,512 --> 01:26:35,480
It's an obsolete term...

1058
01:26:36,582 --> 01:26:38,550
I'm afraid,
once used to describe...

1059
01:26:38,618 --> 01:26:42,884
the elementary basis
of the subconscious mind.

1060
01:26:45,825 --> 01:26:47,760
Monsters from the Id.

1061
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:52,060
Monsters from the subconscious.

1062
01:26:54,868 --> 01:26:57,063
Of course.
That's what Doc meant.

1063
01:27:00,375 --> 01:27:03,071
The big machine... 8,000 cubic miles
of Klystron relays...

1064
01:27:03,144 --> 01:27:05,840
enough power for a whole population
of creative geniuses...

1065
01:27:05,914 --> 01:27:08,178
operated by remote control.

1066
01:27:08,249 --> 01:27:11,447
Morbius, operated by
the electromagnetic impulses...

1067
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:13,818
of individual Krell brains.

1068
01:27:13,889 --> 01:27:15,117
To what purpose?

1069
01:27:15,191 --> 01:27:18,024
In return, that machine would
instantaneously project solid matter...

1070
01:27:18,094 --> 01:27:21,530
to any point on the planet, in any shape
or color they might imagine...

1071
01:27:21,597 --> 01:27:23,532
for any purpose, Morbius!

1072
01:27:24,501 --> 01:27:26,093
Creation by mere thought.

1073
01:27:26,169 --> 01:27:29,104
Why haven't I seen this all along?

1074
01:27:30,774 --> 01:27:33,801
Like you, the Krell forgot
one deadly danger...

1075
01:27:33,878 --> 01:27:37,905
their own subconscious hate
and lust for destruction.

1076
01:27:37,982 --> 01:27:40,917
The beast.
The mindless primitive.

1077
01:27:42,553 --> 01:27:45,614
Even the Krell must have
evolved from that beginning.

1078
01:27:46,692 --> 01:27:49,684
And so those mindless beasts
of the subconscious...

1079
01:27:49,762 --> 01:27:52,322
had access to a machine
that could never be shut down.

1080
01:27:52,398 --> 01:27:55,492
The secret devil
of every soul on the planet...

1081
01:27:55,567 --> 01:27:58,059
all set free at once
to loot and maim...

1082
01:27:59,339 --> 01:28:01,330
and take revenge and kill!

1083
01:28:03,276 --> 01:28:05,301
My poor Krell!

1084
01:28:09,517 --> 01:28:12,884
After a million years
of shining sanity...

1085
01:28:15,222 --> 01:28:18,623
they could hardly have understood
what power was destroying them.

1086
01:28:23,432 --> 01:28:24,865
Yes, young man.

1087
01:28:26,268 --> 01:28:30,432
All very convincing
but for one obvious fallacy.

1088
01:28:32,041 --> 01:28:36,341
The last Krell died
2,000 centuries ago...

1089
01:28:36,412 --> 01:28:38,607
but today, as we all know...

1090
01:28:38,681 --> 01:28:41,616
there is still at large
on this planet a living monster.

1091
01:28:43,287 --> 01:28:47,087
Your mind refuses
to face a conclusion.

1092
01:28:47,157 --> 01:28:47,890
What do you mean?

1093
01:28:47,891 --> 01:28:48,623
What do you mean?

1094
01:28:53,430 --> 01:28:54,898
- Morbius!
- What?

1095
01:28:54,966 --> 01:28:57,833
Something is approaching
from the southwest.

1096
01:28:57,902 --> 01:28:59,870
It is now quite close.

1097
01:29:12,384 --> 01:29:14,352
- Could Robby be wrong?
- No, never.

1098
01:29:18,291 --> 01:29:19,986
There it comes.

1099
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:35,570
I feel sorry for you,
young man.

1100
01:29:35,643 --> 01:29:37,941
Feel sorry for your
daughter, Morbius.

1101
01:29:41,016 --> 01:29:42,574
It's listening.

1102
01:29:48,757 --> 01:29:51,783
- Alta, go into my study.
- You still refuse to face the truth.

1103
01:29:51,860 --> 01:29:54,921
- What truth?
- Morbius, that thing out there.

1104
01:29:54,998 --> 01:29:56,932
- It's you.
- You're insane!

1105
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,764
You have led it here where Alta
must see you torn to pieces!

1106
01:29:59,836 --> 01:30:02,464
You think she's immune?
She's joined herself to me!

1107
01:30:02,539 --> 01:30:04,906
- Yes, and whatever comes, forever.
- Say it's a lie.

1108
01:30:04,975 --> 01:30:07,739
Let it hear you!
Tell it you don't love this man!

1109
01:30:07,811 --> 01:30:10,109
Not even if I could.

1110
01:30:14,385 --> 01:30:17,321
Stop it, Robby!
Don't let it in! Kill it!

1111
01:30:27,967 --> 01:30:30,060
It's no use.

1112
01:30:30,136 --> 01:30:32,229
He knows it's your other self.

1113
01:31:02,371 --> 01:31:03,804
We're safe.

1114
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:07,434
Why did you jumble
that combination?

1115
01:31:07,509 --> 01:31:10,740
Whatever you know in here,
your twin self in the tunnel knows too.

1116
01:31:10,813 --> 01:31:12,782
I'm not a monster, you...

1117
01:31:14,084 --> 01:31:17,178
We're all part monsters
in our subconscious!

1118
01:31:17,253 --> 01:31:20,017
- So we have laws and religion.
- Let me go!

1119
01:31:20,090 --> 01:31:23,253
You've got to listen.
We don't have much time.

1120
01:31:26,864 --> 01:31:28,855
Here's where your mind
was artificially enlarged.

1121
01:31:28,933 --> 01:31:32,096
Consciously it still lacked the power
to operate the great machine...

1122
01:31:32,169 --> 01:31:34,569
but your subconscious
had been made strong enough!

1123
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:37,370
- I won't hear you!
- You've got to listen!

1124
01:31:37,442 --> 01:31:40,775
Twenty years ago, when your comrades
voted to return to Earth...

1125
01:31:40,846 --> 01:31:43,974
you sent your secret Id out
to murder them!

1126
01:31:48,588 --> 01:31:52,251
Not quite realizing it, of course,
except maybe in your dreams.

1127
01:31:53,559 --> 01:31:56,050
What man can remember
his own dreams?

1128
01:31:56,129 --> 01:32:00,260
At least when we approached from space,
you remembered enough to warn us off.

1129
01:32:00,334 --> 01:32:04,600
But when you thought we were a threat
to your little egomaniac empire...

1130
01:32:04,672 --> 01:32:08,301
your subconscious
sent its Id monster out again!

1131
01:32:08,375 --> 01:32:11,311
More deaths, Morbius.
More murder!

1132
01:32:11,379 --> 01:32:14,940
And now this too?
Harm my own daughter?

1133
01:32:15,016 --> 01:32:17,507
But now she's defying you, Morbius...

1134
01:32:17,585 --> 01:32:20,110
and even in you, the loving father,
there still exists...

1135
01:32:20,188 --> 01:32:21,952
the mindless primitive...

1136
01:32:22,024 --> 01:32:25,790
more enraged and more inflamed
with each new frustration.

1137
01:32:25,861 --> 01:32:28,227
So now you're whistling up
your monster again...

1138
01:32:28,297 --> 01:32:30,731
to punish her for her disloyalty
and disobedience!

1139
01:32:32,868 --> 01:32:35,838
And if you don't do something
about it soon...

1140
01:32:35,906 --> 01:32:38,534
it's going to be coming
right through that door.

1141
01:32:43,947 --> 01:32:47,076
Solid Krell metal, 26 inches thick.

1142
01:32:47,151 --> 01:32:50,314
Look at your gauges. Look!

1143
01:32:50,388 --> 01:32:52,652
That machine is going
to supply your monster...

1144
01:32:52,724 --> 01:32:55,318
with whatever amount of power
it requires to reach us.

1145
01:32:56,595 --> 01:32:58,028
Look now!

1146
01:33:07,139 --> 01:33:10,507
Red-hot.
Soon it'll be white-hot.

1147
01:33:10,577 --> 01:33:12,909
Then it'll soften and melt.

1148
01:33:23,257 --> 01:33:27,057
Alta, say you don't believe this of me!
Tell me you don't!

1149
01:33:39,508 --> 01:33:41,442
Then it must be true.

1150
01:33:42,344 --> 01:33:44,404
Yes, I must be guilty!

1151
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:46,641
Then help us, darling!

1152
01:33:46,716 --> 01:33:50,243
I've known you great and noble
like the Krell.

1153
01:34:07,138 --> 01:34:09,902
Guilty! Guilty!

1154
01:34:09,974 --> 01:34:14,343
My evil self is at that door,
and I have no power to stop it!

1155
01:34:45,947 --> 01:34:48,677
Stop! No further!
I deny you! I give you up!

1156
01:35:09,672 --> 01:35:12,607
Father. Oh, Father.

1157
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:17,711
Son...

1158
01:35:19,450 --> 01:35:20,883
turn that disc.

1159
01:35:28,059 --> 01:35:30,118
The switch. Throw it.

1160
01:35:39,939 --> 01:35:41,531
In 24 hours...

1161
01:35:42,942 --> 01:35:47,970
you must be 100 million miles
out in space.

1162
01:35:50,817 --> 01:35:53,217
The Krell furnaces...

1163
01:35:53,287 --> 01:35:55,312
Chain reaction...

1164
01:35:55,389 --> 01:35:57,983
They cannot be reversed.
Alta!

1165
01:36:14,176 --> 01:36:17,668
98.6 million.
We're clear now.

1166
01:36:20,849 --> 01:36:22,282
Quite an astrogator.

1167
01:36:23,886 --> 01:36:26,549
A genuine privilege, Commander.

1168
01:36:26,623 --> 01:36:28,784
Activate main view-plate.

1169
01:36:28,858 --> 01:36:30,325
Aye, aye, Skipper.

1170
01:36:32,862 --> 01:36:36,822
That's Altair-4,
the bright speck below the star.

1171
01:36:38,836 --> 01:36:40,133
Fifteen seconds.

1172
01:36:44,008 --> 01:36:48,446
Yes, Alta, your father,
my shipmates...

1173
01:36:48,513 --> 01:36:50,481
all the stored knowledge
of the Krell.

1174
01:36:51,650 --> 01:36:54,346
Five seconds, four...

1175
01:36:54,419 --> 01:36:57,582
three, two, one...

1176
01:37:08,968 --> 01:37:14,100
Alta, about a million years
from now the human race...

1177
01:37:14,174 --> 01:37:17,666
will have crawled up
to where the Krell stood...

1178
01:37:17,745 --> 01:37:21,807
in their great moment
of triumph and tragedy.

1179
01:37:27,288 --> 01:37:30,485
And your father's name
will shine again...

1180
01:37:30,558 --> 01:37:32,549
like a beacon in the galaxy.

1181
01:37:34,296 --> 01:37:38,995
It's true, it will remind us...

1182
01:37:39,068 --> 01:37:41,366
that we are, after all, not God.
