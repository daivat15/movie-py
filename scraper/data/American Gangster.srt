(ALL LAUGHING)

00:55:48,331 --> 00:55:50,458
So do I, you know?
I think about it every day.

784
00:55:50,542 --> 00:55:53,503
I should be down in South Florida with a
68-foot cruiser doing fishing charters.

785
00:55:53,587 --> 00:55:54,671
MAN:
You and me, both.

786
00:55:54,754 --> 00:55:58,008
But you know,
I didn't, so here I am,

787
00:55:58,091 --> 00:56:00,594
and we'll be looking to land
other kind of sharks.

788
00:56:28,121 --> 00:56:29,873
All right?
ABRUZZO: Bingo.

789
00:56:53,355 --> 00:56:55,523
JONES: See that, Richie?
Yeah.

790
00:56:55,607 --> 00:56:58,568
And this stuff is
your everyday stuff.

791
00:56:58,652 --> 00:57:01,529
But this Blue Magic,
twice the potency.

792
00:57:01,655 --> 00:57:06,284
I mean, it's the purest thing I ever seen in the streets.
It's strong enough to smoke.

793
00:57:06,368 --> 00:57:09,412
And that's for those white suburban kids
who are scared of needles.

794
00:57:09,496 --> 00:57:11,331
ABRUZZO:
I paid 10 bucks for that.

795
00:57:11,414 --> 00:57:14,084
And it's everywhere.
I mean, it's on every corner out there.

796
00:57:14,167 --> 00:57:15,919
So, how is that possible?

797
00:57:16,002 --> 00:57:19,714
Who can afford to sell
shit twice as good for half as much?

Puerto Rico? Is she a beauty queen?

What you smiling about?
I don't know.

What is this? Huh?
What's what?

831
00:59:24,172 --> 00:59:26,299
What's what?
Come here.

832

Yeah, that! What you got on.

very nice suit.

That's a very, very,
very nice suit, huh?

You're making too much noise. Look at me.

The loudest one in the room is the weakest
one in the room. I told you that.

to be like Nicky Barnes, now?

What's your problem with Nicky, man?
I like Nicky.

I ain't got no problem with Nicky.
Oh, you like Nicky?

Yeah!

You wanna work for him?

Maybe cook for him?

He wants to talk to you.

Oh, so now you talking to him about me?
What? You...

849
01:00:04,671 --> 01:00:06,214
About what? What is it about?
It ain't like that.

850
01:00:06,297 --> 01:00:07,632
Then what is it like?
We were talking,

851
01:00:07,715 --> 01:00:09,676
your name came up.
About what?

852
01:00:09,759 --> 01:00:12,679
I don't know, man.
I told him I'd tell you.

motherfucking brains out.

I went shopping.
I can tell.

(SINGING) See deep into you

860
01:00:30,196 --> 01:00:34,659
And know what you're thinking now

861
01:00:35,869 --> 01:00:38,955
And if I'm what you're needing

862
01:00:39,762 --> 01:00:43,891
I need some kind of sign

863
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:49,980
Let me know,
'cause I can't read your mind

864
01:00:50,731 --> 01:00:54,652
Are you in or am I
in this on my own?

865
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:57,154
I need some clue from you

866
01:00:57,947 --> 01:00:59,657
It's a tax thing.

867
01:00:59,949 --> 01:01:01,659
It's a mistake my lawyers
are straightening out,

868
01:01:01,784 --> 01:01:05,120
but for the time being...
How much do you owe, Joe?

869
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,999
It's nothing. It's like...

870
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:10,334
Fifty grand.

871
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:13,837
You got it.

872
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:17,758
Thank you, man. Hey, I'm gonna
pay you back as soon as I...

873
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:21,261
Joe, this ain't no loan.
It's a gift. All right?

874
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:23,931
All you did for Bumpy, we owe you.

875
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:26,600
Keep your chin up. All right? Okay?

876
01:01:26,684 --> 01:01:29,687
All you have which is down there. Down.
Chin down.

877
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:32,356
All right. Doc, will see you, okay?

878
01:01:34,817 --> 01:01:36,276
You play it so cool

879
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,528
Hey!

880
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:40,948
You still owe me that dance, right?

That's right.
I'm Frank and this is my place.

889
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:14,231
Why is it called Small's?
Why don't you call it Frank's?

890
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:19,236
When you own something,
you can call it what you want.

Small's.

892
01:02:20,696 --> 01:02:23,532
Or Frank's. Frankie Small's.

Small's Frankie.

That's right.

895
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:31,165
You want to let my hand go?

896
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:33,834
Okay.

897
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,253
You leaving?

898
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:37,755
No, I was going to my table.

Right here, here we go.
What have we got here?

903
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:52,866

I got one print of that, don't smudge it.

01:02:54,897 --> 01:02:56,023
There you go.

906
01:02:56,231 --> 01:02:58,010
JONES: Hey, Spearman, what about him?
Who is that?

907
01:02:58,094 --> 01:03:00,221
Joey Sodano.
Don Cattano's nephew.

908
01:03:00,304 --> 01:03:01,848
SPEARMAN: Yeah, yeah.
Put him up there by the big man.

909
01:03:01,931 --> 01:03:03,349
JONES:
He looks like your uncle, Abruzzo.

910
01:03:03,433 --> 01:03:04,673
Yeah, but he's not as handsome.

911
01:03:04,684 --> 01:03:06,894
JONES: He looks more like your sister.
MAN: Where's Ice Pick's mug?

912

ABRUZZO:
Yeah, that's funny.

913
01:03:08,104 --> 01:03:09,355
Maybe you guys
should take that show on the road.

914
01:03:09,439 --> 01:03:11,858
So we need Ice Pick Paul.

915
01:03:11,941 --> 01:03:13,317
ABRUZZO: Ice Pick Paul?
JONES: Sure. Yeah.

916
01:03:13,401 --> 01:03:14,902
SPEARMAN:
There you go. Get him up.

917
01:03:14,986 --> 01:03:17,613
ABRUZZO: Ice Pick Paul,
he goes way up there, up top.

918
01:03:17,697 --> 01:03:21,117
No, Ice Pick Paul, he's a fucking
soldier. This guy's a lieutenant.

919
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,368
How's that even fucking possible?

920
01:03:22,452 --> 01:03:24,537
JONES:
That's Benny the Bishop.

921
01:03:25,413 --> 01:03:28,624
That guy is a soldier. This guy's
a lieutenant. No way that guy's on top.

922
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:30,501
JONES: You thinking
of Benny the Bishop.

923
01:03:30,585 --> 01:03:33,504
Vinnie Two Socks is fucking
Cattano's deadbeat son-in-law.

924
01:03:33,588 --> 01:03:34,714
SPEARMAN:
Jonesy's right.

925
01:03:34,797 --> 01:03:38,509
Hey, which one of you guys has ever
actually seen Ice Pick Paul selling drugs?

926
01:03:38,593 --> 01:03:40,817
Actually seen it go down?

927
01:03:40,818 --> 01:03:44,196
Yeah, seen it go down.
Been in his place. Seen him handle drugs.

928
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:46,198
That rat, Ricky, has told us...

929
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:49,618
He's fucking dead.
About four weeks ago.

930
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:51,912
He's dead.

931
01:03:51,995 --> 01:03:54,289
SPEARMAN: (LAUGHING) All right, well,
we can take him off the fucking board.

932
01:03:54,373 --> 01:03:58,836
I don't think we got any
solid evidence on anybody on that board.

933
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:02,381
What you saying, Richie?
This is weeks and weeks of work, man.

934
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:05,968
I'm saying, take it down.
We got to start again from the street.

Scotty! What's going down, brother?

939
01:07:28,086 --> 01:07:31,006
Those snow tires you gave me last night.
They come in yet?

940
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:34,843
Oh, the snow tires?
Yeah. I want some more of them.

No problem.

01:18:33,358 --> 01:18:36,278
She did mention your name, though.

1092
01:18:36,361 --> 01:18:37,529
The stewardess?

1093
01:18:37,613 --> 01:18:39,531
No, not the stewardess.

1094
01:18:40,199 --> 01:18:43,827
The lady from Child Services.
She mentioned your name.

1095
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:47,956
Right after she asked me
if I associated with any criminals.

1096

BOY 1:
All right, go! Go, go!

Go, go.

Get in the pool. Go on.

Come on. Come on.

1102
01:19:02,888 --> 01:19:04,932
So, how'd she get my name?

1103
01:19:05,015 --> 01:19:06,475
Laurie.
Hmm.

1104
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:09,853
She's been saying a lot lately.

1105
01:19:10,646 --> 01:19:11,897
A lot.

1106
01:19:15,692 --> 01:19:18,278
You know, when you asked me
to be your son's godfather,

1107
01:19:18,362 --> 01:19:19,571
I took it very seriously.

1108
01:19:19,655 --> 01:19:21,573
I know.
I know and I appreciate that.

1109
01:19:21,657 --> 01:19:24,618
And I said yes, I would take
on this responsibility.

1110
01:19:24,701 --> 01:19:27,287
Take care of your son, if God
forbid, something happened to you.

1111
01:19:27,371 --> 01:19:30,290
Joe, the kind of things
she's saying to Child Social Services

1112
01:19:30,374 --> 01:19:33,085
made me look really bad, all right.

01:19:49,726 --> 01:19:51,353
Okay, I understand.

1120
01:19:51,436 --> 01:19:55,482
They ask me, I'll tell them what you
want me to tell them. I'll lie for you.

1121
01:19:55,566 --> 01:19:57,776
No, don't lie.
You don't have to lie.

1122
01:19:57,860 --> 01:20:01,029
Just, omit certain details.

1123
01:20:01,738 --> 01:20:03,448
Sure. All right.

1124
01:20:05,742 --> 01:20:07,822
You know, there's something else
I was gonna ask you.

1125
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:11,665
Something else.
You don't have to answer if you don't want.

Blue Magic. Anything?

1127
01:20:17,504 --> 01:20:22,092
Just a lot of sorrow, misery from guys
getting put out of work, that's all.

I don't know.

You're telling me,
it's coming in from South America?

I don't know.

All I can tell you is whoever it is, they're
upsetting the natural order of things.

Of course. Excuse me.

Thank you for a wonderful lunch.
It was delicious.

1214

01:26:16,363 --> 01:26:17,530
You mean like the game?

1216
01:26:17,656 --> 01:26:21,284
No, I just think monopolies were
made illegal in the country, Frank,

1217
01:26:21,368 --> 01:26:23,620
'cause nobody wants
to compete, you know.

1218
01:26:23,703 --> 01:26:26,748
Nobody wants to compete,
not with a monopoly.

1219
01:26:26,873 --> 01:26:29,459
I mean, you let the
dairy farmers do that,

1220
01:26:29,542 --> 01:26:31,586
half of them would be
out of business tomorrow.

1221

Just trying to make a living.

1222
01:26:33,255 --> 01:26:37,842
That's your right, I mean,
it's everyone's right. It's America.

1223
01:26:38,176 --> 01:26:42,389
We just can't do it at the
unreasonable expense of others.

1224
01:26:42,722 --> 01:26:44,808
'Cause then it becomes un-American.

1225
01:26:44,891 --> 01:26:46,935
That's why the price
we pay for that gallon of milk

1226
01:26:47,018 --> 01:26:48,812
could never represent
the true cost of production

1227
01:26:48,895 --> 01:26:53,400
'cause it's got to be controlled.
It's gotta be set. It's gotta be fair.

1228
01:26:53,483 --> 01:26:55,986
Gotta be controlled by who?
I set a price that I think is fair.

1229
01:26:56,069 --> 01:26:57,430
I don't think it's fair.
You don't?

1230
01:26:57,487 --> 01:26:58,989
I don't think it's fair.
I think it's fair.

1231
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:01,074
I mean, I know
your customers are happy, Frank,

1232
01:27:01,157 --> 01:27:03,910
bunch of fucking
junkies that they are.

1233
01:27:03,994 --> 01:27:08,540
But we fellow dairy farmers out here,
Frank, are you thinking of us?

1234
01:27:09,207 --> 01:27:11,001
You thinking of them?

1235
01:27:11,084 --> 01:27:13,128
The dairy farmers?
Yeah.

1236
01:27:13,211 --> 01:27:18,008
I'm thinking of them, Dominic, about
as much as they've ever thought about me.

1237
01:27:18,091 --> 01:27:20,427
I'm just thinking out loud now.

1238
01:27:20,927 --> 01:27:25,265
If you took some of your inventory,
Frank, and you sold it wholesale...

1239
01:27:27,267 --> 01:27:28,310

01:37:41,047 --> 01:37:45,885
He's got five brothers.
He's the oldest. And a lot of cousins.

1392
01:37:46,969 --> 01:37:48,090
They all living up here now,

1393
01:37:48,137 --> 01:37:51,015
spread throughout the
five boroughs and Jersey.

1394
01:37:51,098 --> 01:37:53,351
The brothers are Dexter,

1395
01:37:53,434 --> 01:37:55,645
in Brooklyn. He's a dry cleaner.
What can I do for you?

1396
01:37:55,728 --> 01:37:58,439

MAN: Yeah.

1397
01:37:58,564 --> 01:38:02,735
RICHIE: Melvin in Queens has got a
custom furniture and fire doors business.

1398
01:38:03,945 --> 01:38:05,112
That's it right here?
Right there.

1399
01:38:05,237 --> 01:38:08,449
RICHIE: Terrence in Newark,
he has a hardware store.

1400
01:38:09,367 --> 01:38:11,953
Turner in the Bronx
has got a tire shop.

1401
01:38:13,579 --> 01:38:16,374
And Huey Lucas in Bergen County
has a body shop.

That's my price.

somewhere else, all right?

1404

the distribution and collection points

1405

1406
01:38:26,342 --> 01:38:31,889
Everything about Frank's life seems
unpretentious, orderly and legitimate.

1407
01:38:32,598 --> 01:38:35,142
He starts early,
gets up at 5:00 a.m.

1408
01:38:35,226 --> 01:38:39,021
Has breakfast in a diner in Harlem
every morning, usually by himself.

1409
01:38:39,105 --> 01:38:40,189
Then he starts work.

1410
01:38:40,272 --> 01:38:43,734
Takes a meeting with the accountant
or with his lawyer.

1411
01:38:43,818 --> 01:38:47,071
At nights, he usually stays at home.
And if he does go out,

1412
01:38:47,154 --> 01:38:51,200
it's to one of two clubs or a handful
of restaurants with his new wife.

1413
01:38:51,283 --> 01:38:53,283
Some ball players.
That's fucking Wilt Chamberlain.

1414

RICHIE: Friends, musicians.
Never, never with organized crime guys.

1415
01:38:57,665 --> 01:39:00,459
Sundays, he takes his
mother to church.

1416
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,503
Then he drives out
and he changes

1417
01:39:02,628 --> 01:39:06,632
the flowers on Bumpy's grave.
Every Sunday, no matter what.

TOBACK: Not the typical day
in the life of a dope man, Richie.

1419
01:39:10,428 --> 01:39:11,512
RICHIE:
No.

1420
01:39:11,637 --> 01:39:15,474
Bumpy Johnson's life wasn't typical
either, and he ran Harlem for years.

1421
01:39:15,558 --> 01:39:19,061
TOBACK: So you're saying that
Frank Lucas replaced Bumpy Johnson?

1422
01:39:19,145 --> 01:39:20,646
RICHIE: Yeah.
TOBACK: His driver?

1423
01:39:20,730 --> 01:39:23,315
RICHIE: Yeah.
TOBACK: Sounds a little farfetched.

1424
01:39:23,399 --> 01:39:25,985
RICHIE: But is it? Is it?
Because everything he does...

1425
01:39:26,068 --> 01:39:27,236
JONES:
He's handing out turkeys, man.

1426
01:39:27,319 --> 01:39:29,739
RICHIE: he does the same as
Bumpy would have done, right?

1427
01:39:29,822 --> 01:39:32,908
And who was Bumpy
most likely to teach?

1428
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:35,077
The guy he sees every day.

1429
01:39:35,161 --> 01:39:37,496
It's like a Sicilian family.

1430
01:39:37,621 --> 01:39:41,709
He's structured his organization
to protect him in the same way.

1431
01:39:41,792 --> 01:39:43,232
And if he was with
Bumpy for so long,

1432
01:39:43,294 --> 01:39:45,921
that means he would have
spent a lot of time with Italians.

1433
01:39:46,005 --> 01:39:48,841
Definitely long enough
to learn that much.

Who we want is whoever Frank Lucas
is working for.

It's whoever's actually
bringing the heroin in.

1437
01:39:58,562 --> 01:40:05,193
Okay. So what do you have on him that will
stick in court? Because this isn't it.

1438

Without powder, without informants,
no one's going to jail.

RICHIE:
That's understood, sir.

1440
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:15,620
And I don't think we're gonna get
informants, not from inside the family,

You can make enough money off it the way
it is, just by calling it Blue Magic.

1541
01:46:58,162 --> 01:46:59,998
Anything more than
that is greed, son.

1542
01:47:00,081 --> 01:47:02,000
What you want, Frank?
You want me to change the name on it?

1543
01:47:02,083 --> 01:47:04,127
I would have to insist
that you change the name.

1544
01:47:04,210 --> 01:47:08,089
Fine by me, Frank. I'll call it Red Magic,
even though that don't sound as good.

1545
01:47:08,172 --> 01:47:11,052
I don't give a fuck what you call it.
Put a chokehold on the motherfucker

1546
01:47:11,134 --> 01:47:13,761
and call it Blue Dog Shit,
you know what I mean?

1547
01:47:13,845 --> 01:47:18,099
I don't care, just don't let
me catch you doing this again.

1548
01:47:18,224 --> 01:47:20,852
Catch me? Infringement?
Insist?

1549
01:47:20,935 --> 01:47:22,770
I don't like these
words as much as,

1550
01:47:22,895 --> 01:47:25,606
"Please, thank you,
I'm sorry to bother you, Nicky."

1551
01:47:25,732 --> 01:47:27,859
These are better words you use to come
to my motherfucking club

1552
01:47:27,942 --> 01:47:30,528
without an invitation! You hear me?

1553
01:47:31,487 --> 01:47:32,780
My man.

1554
01:47:41,331 --> 01:47:44,334
Oh, shit. Fuck,
is that the cops there, man?

1555
01:47:53,343 --> 01:47:54,969
It's all right.

1556
01:47:56,054 --> 01:47:58,973
The hell they're gonna do,
give us a ticket?

1557
01:47:59,057 --> 01:48:01,351
Stuff's in the car, Frank.

1558
01:48:03,227 --> 01:48:04,270
What?

1559
01:48:04,354 --> 01:48:06,522
Some of it's in the trunk.

1560
01:48:08,149 --> 01:48:09,984
How you doing, Frank?
I'm good. How you doing, Detective?

1561
01:48:10,068 --> 01:48:11,527
How was your Thanksgiving?

1562
01:48:11,611 --> 01:48:14,252
Not so good, as a matter of fact.
Why don't you get out of the car?

1563
01:48:19,619 --> 01:48:20,703
Come on, give me the fucking keys.

1564
01:48:20,787 --> 01:48:23,039
Where's the Shelby at?
The Shelby's gone, Frank.

1565
01:48:23,122 --> 01:48:24,540
The Shelby's gone?
Stay right there.

1566
01:48:24,624 --> 01:48:26,542
Yes, sir. Right here.

1567
01:48:27,585 --> 01:48:29,212
TRUPO: You got anything
worth looking at in here?

1568
01:48:29,295 --> 01:48:31,047
RICHIE: Hey, that's that Trupo guy.

1569
01:48:31,130 --> 01:48:32,715
SPEARMANI Is that him?
RICHIE: Yeah.

1570
01:48:32,799 --> 01:48:34,300
Fucking prick.

1571
01:48:35,468 --> 01:48:37,303
(EXCLAIMING)

1572
01:48:37,512 --> 01:48:39,972
Come over here a minute, Frank.
Yeah.

1573
01:48:42,183 --> 01:48:43,309
What are we gonna do about this?

1574
01:48:43,393 --> 01:48:45,812
We don't do shit about it. We close
it up, throw it back in the trunk,

1575
01:48:45,895 --> 01:48:48,523
everybody go home, have some
pumpkin pie, warm apple cider.

1576
01:48:48,606 --> 01:48:50,441
I got a better idea.

1577
01:48:51,567 --> 01:48:54,946
Or would you rather me throw you
and your brother in the fucking river?

1578
01:48:55,029 --> 01:48:58,116
Would you rather your house
blows up next time?

1579
01:49:02,286 --> 01:49:04,580
I loved that car.
I know.

1580
01:49:07,875 --> 01:49:11,003
RICHIE:
What's he doing? Shakedown!

1581
01:49:11,671 --> 01:49:13,840
Somebody's getting some money
for the Benevolent Fund.

1582
01:49:13,923 --> 01:49:15,004
SPEARMAN:
Look at that shit.

1583
01:49:15,633 --> 01:49:16,968
Sorry, Frank.

1584
01:49:17,051 --> 01:49:19,303
It's all right.
Go and get in the car.

1585
01:49:19,387 --> 01:49:21,305
(CAR ENGINE STARTING)

1586
01:49:42,702 --> 01:49:45,163
RICHIE:
All right, you call me back.

1587
01:49:46,456 --> 01:49:50,584
INS, IRS, FBI. I can't get a
damn thing out of any of them.

1588
01:49:50,585 --> 01:49:56,090
Because they all think you're on
the take. And you think they are.

1589
01:49:56,174 --> 01:49:59,093
You know, I don't think
they want this to stop.

1590
01:49:59,177 --> 01:50:01,596
I think it employs too many people.

1591
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:07,810
Judges, lawyers, cops, politicians,
prison guards, probation officers.

1592
01:50:08,394 --> 01:50:09,520
They stop bringing dope
into this country,

1593
01:50:09,604 --> 01:50:12,356
about 100,000 people
are going to be out of a job.

01:50:15,610 --> 01:50:18,654
Spearman.

1595
01:50:18,738 --> 01:50:22,116
FBI. Here to see Detective Roberts.

1596
01:50:26,704 --> 01:50:30,458
So who took it out? Somebody I know?
My wife?

1597
01:50:31,792 --> 01:50:35,213
Come on, if somebody's taking a contract
out on my life, I'd like to know.

1598
01:50:35,296 --> 01:50:38,883
I can't say without compromising
our source. You understand?

1599
01:50:38,966 --> 01:50:41,385
No. Not when it's my life,
I don't understand.

1600
01:50:41,469 --> 01:50:44,722
If you want we can assign someone to you.
FBI protection.

1601
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:49,060
You know what? My life
is dangerous enough as it is.

1602
01:50:50,311 --> 01:50:52,188
Well, we'll let you get back
to your business.

1603
01:50:52,313 --> 01:50:56,776
Okay. Larry, Bob.
Thanks for visiting The Garden State.

1604
01:50:56,859 --> 01:50:57,944
Take care.

1605
01:50:58,027 --> 01:51:00,404
Hey, what do you know
about Frank Lucas?

1606
01:51:00,488 --> 01:51:03,908
We know that you keep
calling about him.

1607
01:51:13,626 --> 01:51:18,172
We believe that peace is at hand.

1608
01:51:20,174 --> 01:51:24,679
We believe that an agreement
is within sight.

1609
01:51:24,762 --> 01:51:26,138
(PHONE RINGING)

1610
01:51:27,431 --> 01:51:30,601
As I said earlier...

1611
01:51:35,022 --> 01:51:36,148
Yeah.

1612
01:51:37,233 --> 01:51:39,235
Hey, Joey. Hi.

1613
01:51:41,153 --> 01:51:43,990
All right. Yeah, tomorrow. Why?

1614
01:52:02,508 --> 01:52:03,948
RICHIE:
What the fuck is a microwave?

1615
01:52:04,910 --> 01:52:07,997
JOEY: It's a scientific force,
like atomic energy.

1616
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:09,957
Yeah?
JOEY: Yeah.

1617
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:12,126
It rearranges the molecules.

1618
01:52:12,209 --> 01:52:14,336
RICHIE: Of what?
JOEY: Of what? Of popcorn.

(BUZZER BEEPING)

1620
01:52:17,506 --> 01:52:20,301
Of your head.
Stick it in. Go on.

1621
01:52:23,595 --> 01:52:25,681
I can get you one of those.

1622
01:52:25,764 --> 01:52:29,101
Brand new, just like this.
I'll have it delivered.

1623
01:52:29,476 --> 01:52:31,061
No, thank you.

1624
01:52:40,696 --> 01:52:42,740
Hey. Where is that?

1625
01:52:42,823 --> 01:52:47,202
Aspen. We just got back.
Had a great time. You know who we met?

1626
01:52:47,286 --> 01:52:49,038
Who?

1627
01:52:49,121 --> 01:52:50,956
Burt Reynolds.

1628
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:54,793
Yeah? Yeah?
Yeah. I'm not kidding.

1629
01:52:54,877 --> 01:52:58,839
A lot people from Hollywood go up there
now. They're buying up everything.

1630
01:52:58,922 --> 01:53:00,591
This is your place?
Mmm.

1631
01:53:00,674 --> 01:53:04,553
You know what that's worth?
Ski in, ski out. Five bedrooms.

1632
01:53:04,636 --> 01:53:07,765
Sauna. Everything. We were guests.

1633
01:53:12,478 --> 01:53:14,146
It's your place.

1634
01:53:29,244 --> 01:53:31,789
Isn't there something
we can do,

1635
01:53:33,624 --> 01:53:36,460
about leaving the big guy alone?

1636
01:53:36,543 --> 01:53:38,504
You know who I mean.

1637
01:53:38,587 --> 01:53:42,174
I don't report what you just said,
I can get in a lot of trouble.

1638
01:53:42,257 --> 01:53:45,094
I do report it,
then the trouble is yours.

1639
01:53:47,262 --> 01:53:49,598
I'm hoping you won't do that.

1640
01:53:50,391 --> 01:53:52,976
Richie, come on. I'm not taping it.

1641
01:53:53,060 --> 01:53:56,146
How do you know?
Because we're friends.

1642
01:53:56,230 --> 01:53:58,690
And I'm telling you,
this is a real offer.

1643
01:53:58,774 --> 01:54:00,692
From who? Your uncle?

1644
01:54:04,363 --> 01:54:06,907
Why would you do this?
Why would you risk our friendship?

1645
01:54:06,990 --> 01:54:08,367
Because

1646
01:54:10,619 --> 01:54:12,955
I care what happens to you.

1647
01:54:14,998 --> 01:54:16,875
You shouldn't have done this.

1648
01:54:16,959 --> 01:54:20,170
I had to, I had no choice.
Neither do you. Richie!

1649
01:54:20,879 --> 01:54:24,716
You don't have a choice.
Just leave Frank Lucas alone.

1650
01:54:26,385 --> 01:54:27,845
Frank Lucas?

1651
01:54:29,054 --> 01:54:30,222
Yeah.

1652
01:54:32,850 --> 01:54:35,769
You tell Marie I had to leave.
I'm sorry.

1653
01:54:36,562 --> 01:54:38,063
Tell her why.

1654
01:55:20,939 --> 01:55:22,441
Talk! Talk!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

Are you Richie Roberts?
Yes, so what?

1656
01:55:25,569 --> 01:55:27,821
You've been served.
I'm sorry.

1659
01:55:50,469 --> 01:55:54,223
Look, I'm sorry I never gave you
the kind of life you wanted, all right.

1660
01:55:54,306 --> 01:55:56,642
I'm sorry it was never enough.

1661
01:55:59,728 --> 01:56:02,397
Don't punish me for
being honest.

1662
01:56:02,481 --> 01:56:04,483
Don't take my boy away.

(SCOFFS)

1664
01:56:06,818 --> 01:56:10,197
What are you saying?
That because you were honest

1665
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:13,492
and you didn't take money
like every other cop, I left you?

1666
01:56:13,575 --> 01:56:16,119
No, you don't take money
for one reason.

1667
01:56:16,203 --> 01:56:19,414
To buy being dishonest
about everything else.

1668
01:56:19,498 --> 01:56:21,542
And that's worse than taking money
nobody gives a shit about.

1669
01:56:21,625 --> 01:56:24,920
Drug money, gambling money
nobody's gonna miss.

1670
01:56:25,003 --> 01:56:28,507
You know, I'd rather you took it
and been honest with me.

1671
01:56:28,590 --> 01:56:31,301
Or don't take it. I don't care.
But then don't go cheat on me.

1672
01:56:31,385 --> 01:56:33,345
Don't cheat on your kid
by never being around.

1673
01:56:33,428 --> 01:56:37,641
Don't go out and get laid by your snitches
and your secretaries and strippers!

1674
01:56:37,724 --> 01:56:40,561
I can tell byjust looking,
she's one of them.

1675
01:56:40,644 --> 01:56:41,728
You...

1676
01:56:41,812 --> 01:56:46,441
You think you're going to heaven
because you're honest, but you're not.

1677
01:56:46,525 --> 01:56:49,125
You're going to the same hell
as the crooked cops you can't stand.

Please be seated.

1681
01:56:59,538 --> 01:57:03,917
Miss Dickerson, before the
court renders its opinion,

1682
01:57:04,001 --> 01:57:06,712
is there anything else
you'd like to be heard on?

1683
01:57:06,795 --> 01:57:08,547
Yes, Your Honor.

1684
01:57:08,630 --> 01:57:11,800
Your Honor, a lot has been said
here today about how unsavory

1685
01:57:11,883 --> 01:57:15,887
Mr. Roberts' environment is for a child.
How dangerous it is.

1686
01:57:15,971 --> 01:57:19,766
We tell him to protect us.
We give him that responsibility,

1687
01:57:19,850 --> 01:57:22,436
but then say, "Oh, we don't
trust you to raise a child.

1688
01:57:22,519 --> 01:57:24,104
"We don't think
you're fit for that."

1689
01:57:24,187 --> 01:57:25,814

from being so successful. Look at you.

Lots of enemies.

Frank, we can be successful
and have enemies, right?

Or we can be unsuccessful, too,

TRUPO: Hey.
Help me outwith this.

2005
02:17:45,800 --> 02:17:48,261
That was a military
transport plane.

2006
02:17:48,386 --> 02:17:49,554
If there was heroin on board,

2007
02:17:49,637 --> 02:17:51,472
then someone in the military
would have to be involved.

2008
02:17:51,556 --> 02:17:56,018
Which means that even as it fights a war
that's claimed 50,000 American lives,

2009
02:17:56,102 --> 02:17:58,479
the military is
smuggling narcotics.

2010
02:17:58,563 --> 02:18:01,232
That is how this event today
will be interpreted.

2011
02:18:01,315 --> 02:18:02,984
That someone employed
by this office

2012
02:18:03,067 --> 02:18:06,654
believes that the United States Army
is in the drug trafficking business

2013
02:18:06,737 --> 02:18:10,116
and is trying to prove it by
desecrating the remains of young men

2014
02:18:10,199 --> 02:18:13,119
who have given their lives
in the defense of democracy!

2015
02:18:13,202 --> 02:18:15,746
There is dope on that plane.
Shut the fuck up!

2016
02:18:17,248 --> 02:18:20,626
Is it any wonder, then,
because of your actions,

2017
02:18:20,710 --> 02:18:22,920
the entire federal narcotics
program is now in jeopardy

2018
02:18:23,004 --> 02:18:26,007
of being dismantled as completely
and enthusiastically

2019
02:18:26,090 --> 02:18:27,925
as that fucking transport plane?

2020
02:18:28,009 --> 02:18:30,511
That is what you've accomplished,
Mr. Roberts, single-handedly.

2021
02:18:30,595 --> 02:18:32,680
I had good information.

2022
02:18:32,763 --> 02:18:36,309
That the target of my investigation
was bringing dope in on that plane.

2023
02:18:36,392 --> 02:18:38,311
And that target is?
Frank Lucas.

2024
02:18:38,394 --> 02:18:40,521
Who?
His name's Frank Lucas.

2025
02:18:40,605 --> 02:18:43,191
Who is Frank Lucas?
Who does he work for? Which family?

2026
02:18:43,274 --> 02:18:45,359
He's not Italian.
He's black.

Is that supposed to be
some kind of a joke?

2029
02:18:51,616 --> 02:18:53,868
You're this close to the end of
your career in law enforcement

2030
02:18:53,951 --> 02:18:56,579
and you're making
fucking jokes?

2031
02:18:56,662 --> 02:18:58,998
My investigation indicates

2032
02:18:59,123 --> 02:19:02,543
that Frank Lucas is above the
Mafia in the dope business.

2033
02:19:02,627 --> 02:19:04,170
My investigations also indicate

2034
02:19:04,253 --> 02:19:08,424
that Frank Lucas buys direct
from a source in Southeast Asia.

2035
02:19:08,507 --> 02:19:11,677
He cuts out the middlemen
and uses US military planes

2036
02:19:11,802 --> 02:19:15,640
and personnel to transport pure number
4 heroin into the United States

2037
02:19:15,723 --> 02:19:19,810
and he's been doing so
on a regular basis since 1969.

2038
02:19:19,894 --> 02:19:22,813
I have cases against
every member of Frank's organization.

2039
02:19:22,897 --> 02:19:24,023
Frank's organization?

2040
02:19:24,148 --> 02:19:27,902

the American Mafia hasn't in 100 years!

2041

get this fucking kike out of here?

they'd be soldiers. You know that.

2063

They came here because of you.
You called and they came running.

2064
02:21:10,921 --> 02:21:12,006
Right.

2065
02:21:12,089 --> 02:21:15,509
That's because they look up to you.

2066
02:21:15,593 --> 02:21:19,930
They always expect you
to know what's best.

2067
02:21:20,181 --> 02:21:22,350
But even they know

2068
02:21:22,433 --> 02:21:24,268
you don't shoot cops.

02:38:06,144 --> 02:38:08,355
You represent progress.

2303
02:38:08,438 --> 02:38:11,900
The kind of progress that's going
to see them lose a lot of money.

2304
02:38:11,983 --> 02:38:15,612
With you out of the way,
everything can return to normal.

2305
02:38:16,696 --> 02:38:17,947
My man.

2306
02:38:22,786 --> 02:38:25,121
You know what normal
is to me, Richie?

2307
02:38:25,205 --> 02:38:28,291
I ain't seen normal since
I was six years old.

2308
02:38:29,626 --> 02:38:32,253
Normal is seeing the police
right up to my house

2309
02:38:32,337 --> 02:38:35,298
dragging my little 12-year-old
cousin out, tying him to a pole,

2310
02:38:35,382 --> 02:38:38,551
shoving a shotgun in his mouth
so hard they bust his teeth.

2311
02:38:38,635 --> 02:38:41,930
Then they bust two shotgun shells in his
head and knock his fucking head off.

2312
02:38:42,013 --> 02:38:43,264
That's what normal is to me.

2313
02:38:43,348 --> 02:38:46,434
I didn't give a fuck
about no police then.

2314
02:38:46,518 --> 02:38:49,521
I don't give a fuck about
no police now. Shit.

2315
02:38:49,854 --> 02:38:52,148
You know what,
you can do whatever you want to do.

2316
02:38:52,232 --> 02:38:54,734
So, it don't mean nothing to me
for you to show up tomorrow morning

2317
02:38:54,818 --> 02:38:57,737
with your head blown off.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

2318
02:38:57,821 --> 02:39:03,243
Yeah, Frank. Get in line.
That one stretches around the block, too.

2319
02:39:06,663 --> 02:39:07,997
All right.

2320
02:39:11,793 --> 02:39:13,253
What do you want to do?

2321
02:39:19,801 --> 02:39:21,469
You know what you got to do.

2322
02:39:21,553 --> 02:39:23,346
What do you want me to do?
Snitch, huh?

2323
02:39:23,430 --> 02:39:24,931
I know you don't want me
to give up no cops.

2324
02:39:25,014 --> 02:39:27,100
What do you want?
You want gangsters?

2325
02:39:27,183 --> 02:39:30,979
Pick one. Jew gangsters?
Mick gangsters? Guineas?

2326
02:39:31,438 --> 02:39:34,190
They've been bleeding Harlem dry
since they got off the boat, Richie.

2327
02:39:34,274 --> 02:39:38,111
I don't give a fuck about no crime
figures. You can have them.

2328
02:39:39,195 --> 02:39:40,780
I'll take them, too.

2329
02:39:40,864 --> 02:39:42,782
You'll take them, too?

2330
02:39:47,912 --> 02:39:51,624
No, you didn't. You're talking
about police. You want police?

2331
02:39:52,208 --> 02:39:53,251
You want your own kind?

2332
02:39:53,334 --> 02:39:55,295
They're not my kind.

2333
02:39:55,378 --> 02:39:58,089
They're in business with you, Frank.
They ain't my kind.

2334
02:39:58,173 --> 02:40:02,093
They ain't my kind like the
Italians are not yours. All right?

2335
02:40:05,346 --> 02:40:06,389
Huh.

2336
02:40:15,690 --> 02:40:18,109
What can you promise me, Richie?

2337
02:40:21,070 --> 02:40:24,532
I can promise you,
you lie about one name,

2338
02:40:24,616 --> 02:40:26,534
you'll never get out of prison.

2339
02:40:26,618 --> 02:40:29,370
You lie about one dollar,
in one offshore account,

2340
02:40:29,454 --> 02:40:31,748
you'll never get out of prison.

2341
02:40:32,832 --> 02:40:37,086
Now you can live life rich in jail
for the rest of your born days,

2342
02:40:37,587 --> 02:40:40,215
or be poor outside
for some of them.

2343
02:40:41,132 --> 02:40:43,468
That's what I can promise you.

2344
02:40:46,304 --> 02:40:52,477
I want them cops, Richie.
That's what I want, I want them cops

2345
02:40:53,770 --> 02:40:57,023
that took that money
out of my pockets.

2346
02:40:59,734 --> 02:41:01,319
Him, too.

2347
02:41:01,402 --> 02:41:03,321
All right. Okay.

2348
02:41:05,156 --> 02:41:07,450
Hey, Spearman? Spearman.

2349
02:41:08,076 --> 02:41:10,662
So these guys are all connected up
to Gwynn, all right.

2350
02:41:10,787 --> 02:41:13,414
See this guy here,
he's in uniform...

2351
02:41:14,249 --> 02:41:16,543
NEWSCASTER 1: Four police

2353
02:41:19,295 --> 02:41:20,505
MAN:

2354

NEWSCASTER 2: The investigation

2356

will face stiff prison terms,

2360
02:41:41,943 --> 02:41:44,821
say federal prosecutors,
if found guilty.

2361
02:41:44,946 --> 02:41:47,426
NEWSCASTER 5: A report by
federal investigators into New York's

2362
02:41:47,490 --> 02:41:49,617
ever widening police
corruption scandal

2363
02:41:49,701 --> 02:41:52,370
claims that more than
half of the city's officers

2364
02:41:52,495 --> 02:41:56,708
assigned to drug enforcement have
engaged in some form of corruption.

will face sentencing
today in federal court.

2371
02:42:17,145 --> 02:42:20,064
FRANK:
MacNamara. Vendazzo.

2372
02:42:21,232 --> 02:42:22,567
Trupo.

2373
02:42:25,862 --> 02:42:27,322
You are special.

2374
02:43:03,524 --> 02:43:04,734
(GROANS)

2375
02:43:10,740 --> 02:43:12,700
It's good work, Frank.

2376
02:43:13,868 --> 02:43:15,244
You know...

2377
02:43:15,411 --> 02:43:19,082
You don't want a drink or something?
Celebrate?

2378
02:43:19,666 --> 02:43:21,584
You got any holy water?

2379
02:44:16,139 --> 02:44:18,933
Check your property. Sign, please.

2380
02:44:32,655 --> 02:44:34,240
(DOOR BUZZING)

2381
02:45:10,818 --> 02:45:14,280
Smell better out here?

2382
02:45:32,632 --> 02:45:35,134
Frank. There you are.

2383
02:45:35,885 --> 02:45:38,429
Caffe latte. Yeah.
Latte?

2384
02:45:38,513 --> 02:45:41,390
Oh, shit. Yeah.
You all right?

2385
02:45:41,557 --> 02:45:44,477
That's a fancy way of saying
coffee with milk.

2386
02:45:44,644 --> 02:45:45,978
Yeah.
$2.50.

2387
02:45:49,482 --> 02:45:51,943
So you been talking
to your brothers?

2388
02:45:52,026 --> 02:45:55,404
No, no, I ain't talked to them in years.
It's probably best for them.

2389
02:45:59,367 --> 02:46:03,829
What the hell am I going to do out here,
Richie? I don't know how I'm gonna live.

2390
02:46:06,040 --> 02:46:09,126
Hey, I told ya, I ain't gonna
let you starve, all right?

2391
02:46:09,210 --> 02:46:10,670
Obviously, you ain't starving.

2392
02:46:10,753 --> 02:46:11,837
(LAUGHING)

2393
02:46:11,921 --> 02:46:15,007
Bagels and blinches. They will
catch up with you, you know?

2394
02:46:19,178 --> 02:46:20,263
Who's this?

2395
02:46:20,888 --> 02:46:23,683
Expensive sneakers.
About $100 a pair.

2396
02:46:33,025 --> 02:46:34,944
Frederick Douglass Boulevard.

2397
02:46:36,237 --> 02:46:41,200
This used to be Eighth Avenue, why do they
call it Frederick Douglass Boulevard now?

2398
02:46:45,454 --> 02:46:48,541
This was me Richie, right here.
This was all me.

2399
02:46:50,042 --> 02:46:52,169
In my day there were so many niggers
out here buying dope

2400
02:46:52,253 --> 02:46:54,964
you could've made a Tarzan movie.

2401
02:46:55,715 --> 02:46:59,218
You know, one phone call, I'll be right
back in business, you know that.

2402
02:46:59,302 --> 02:47:02,722
You don't do that, Frank.
These days I keep all my promises.

2403
02:47:13,899 --> 02:47:16,235
Why'd you come and get me, huh?

2404
02:47:16,319 --> 02:47:18,279
You're a superstar, Frank.

2405
02:47:18,404 --> 02:47:19,614
A superstar?

2406
02:47:20,781 --> 02:47:24,910
Your evidence alone
gave me 150 convictions.

2407
02:47:25,328 --> 02:47:28,414
Thought the least we could do
is give you a ride home.

2408
02:47:28,748 --> 02:47:32,668
Yeah, you sure did that.
You gave me a ride home. Free ride.

2409
02:47:33,127 --> 02:47:35,588
Coming to gangsters.

2410
02:47:39,300 --> 02:47:40,426
What?

2411
02:47:42,762 --> 02:47:45,765
Ain't nothin', man.
Ain't nothin', man.

2412
02:47:46,515 --> 02:47:48,684
That's life right there.
That's life right there.

2413
02:47:49,101 --> 02:47:52,355
Even a fool gets to
be young once.
