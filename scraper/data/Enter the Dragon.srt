1
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,613
Teacher.

2
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:43,954
I see your talents have gone
beyond the mere physical level.

3
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:48,208
Your skills are now at the point
of spiritual insight.

4
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,796
I have questions: what is the highest
technique you hope to achieve?

5
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,632
-To have no technique.
-Very good.

6
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,302
What are your thoughts
when facing an opponent?

7
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,179
There is no opponent.

8
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,889
And why is that?

9
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:06,185
Because the word "I" does not exist.

10
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,813
So. Continue.

11
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,859
A good fight should be. . .

12
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,573
. . . like a small play, but played seriously.

13
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:25,204
A good martial artist
does not become tense, but ready.

14
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,832
Not thinking, yet not dreaming.

15
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,502
Ready for whatever may come.

16
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,630
When the opponent expand, I contract.

17
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,174
When he contracts, I expand.

18
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,927
And when there is an opportunity. . .

19
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,222
. . . I do not hit.

20
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,101
It hits all by itself.

21
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,853
Now, you must remember. . .

22
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:54,024
. . .the enemy has only images
and illusions. . .

23
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:57,694
. . . behind which he hides his true motives.

24
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:01,532
Destroy the image
and you will break the enemy.

25
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:07,204
The "it" that you refer to
is a powerful weapon. . .

26
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:13,502
. . .easily misused by the martial artist
who deserts his vows.

27
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:19,007
For centuries now, the code
of the Shaolin Temple has been preserved.

28
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:24,847
Remember, the honor of our brotherhood
has been held true.

29
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:30,018
Tell me now the Shaolin commandment
number 13.

30
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:34,189
"A martial artist has to take responsibility
for himself. . .

31
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:38,110
. . .and accept the consequences
of his own doing."

32
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,740
I'm ashamed to tell you now. . .

33
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:47,619
. . .among all the Shaolin men
I have taught. . .

34
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,999
. . .there is one who has turned
the ways of knowledge and strength. . .

35
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,002
. . .to his own base ends.

36
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,090
He has perverted all we hold sacred.

37
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,302
His name is Han.

38
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:07,514
In defiance of all our beliefs. . .

39
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:13,645
. . . he has brought disgrace
to the Shaolin Temple.

40
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:19,610
So it is now for you to reclaim
our lost honor.

41
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:22,905
Yes. I understand.

42
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:27,075
There is a man here.
You will go to him.

43
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,503
Hello, Mr. Lee.
My name's Braithwaite.

44
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,796
Hello, Mr. Braithwaite.

45
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:44,343
I've come to speak to you
about a matter of great importance.

46
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:47,471
-Have some tea?
-Yes, indeed.

47
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,935
This is very pleasant.

48
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,489
Mr. Lee, I've come to speak to you
about a tournament of martial arts.

49
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,617
A tournament to which
you've received an invitation.

50
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,871
Specifically, a tournament
organized by Mr. Han.

51
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,584
-Han's tournament.
-I know, I know, I know.

52
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:22,256
But we'd very much like you to attend
that particular tournament, Mr. Lee.

53
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,175
"We," Mr. Braithwaite?

54
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,346
It's Lao's time.

55
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,515
Yes, of course.

56
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:48,615
Kick me.

57
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,501
What was that? An exhibition?

58
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:04,214
We need emotional content.

59
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,551
Try again.

60
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:23,066
I said, emotional content, not anger.

61
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:26,903
Now, try again. With me.

62
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,999
That's it.

63
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,585
How did it feel to you?

64
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,423
Let me think. . . .

65
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,885
Don't think. Feel.

66
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:54,473
It is like a finger pointing
a way to the moon.

67
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,185
Don't concentrate on the finger. . .

68
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:02,773
. . .or you will miss all that heavenly glory.

69
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,817
Do you understand?

70
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:15,035
Never take your eyes off your opponent,
even when you bow.

71
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,288
That's it.

72
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,766
There.

73
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:46,436
That's Han. That's the only film
we have on him.

74
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,688
We know he was a member
of your temple.

75
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:52,692
A Shaolin monk, now a renegade.

76
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,197
That's Oharra behind him.
Personal bodyguard.

77
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:01,618
Tough, ruthless, as you might expect,
being Han's bodyguard.

78
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,914
We got our hands
on a demonstration film of Oharra.

79
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:10,293
All real bricks and boards,
nothing phony about any of it.

80
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:14,422
This was before he picked up
a facial scar somewhere.

81
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,435
This is where you'll be going.

82
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,605
An island fortress, really.

83
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:36,528
After the war, the nationality of the island
was uncertain.

84
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,407
And sometime after that, Han bought it.

85
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,158
What do you know about Han?

86
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,703
He lives like a king on that island.

87
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,706
Totally self-sufficient.

88
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,666
All of his efforts, seemingly. . .

89
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:55,922
. . .are directed toward supporting
what he calls his "school of martial arts."

90
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,426
Han's only contact with the outside world
is this tournament. . .

91
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,469
. . .which he holds every three years.

92
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:07,350
This was a stewardess, Mary King,
found floating in the harbor.

93
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,186
Nothing unusual about a body
in the harbor.

94
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:14,524
But this girl was last seen at a party
aboard Han's private junk.

95
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,861
They'd reported her lost at sea
before the body was found.

96
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,655
We believe he selects attractive girls...

97
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,533
...methodically builds
their dependence on drugs...

98
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:27,162
...then sells them to an elite clientele
around the world.

99
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,206
What did the autopsy reveal
as the cause of death?

100
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,543
-She did not drown.
-She OD'd?

101
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:44,054
Yes. Cause of death was heroin overdose.

102
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,973
You still don't have enough
to bust up his operation.

103
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:51,436
We know everything.
We can prove nothing.

104
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,523
We want you to go in there as our agent.

105
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:59,194
-Get us our evidence.
-And get out in one piece to give it to you.

106
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,073
We'll give you anything you need.

107
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,867
Electronic equipment, weapons, anything.

108
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,662
-Drink?
-No, thanks.

109
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,205
Guns.

110
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:14,542
Now, why doesn't somebody
pull out a .45 and bang, settle it?

111
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,003
No. No guns.

112
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,048
Look at this map here.

113
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:26,471
As you know, the possession of a weapon
is a serious offense here.

114
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,477
Han's island rests partly
within our territorial waters.

115
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:36,398
If we had the slightest reason to believe
he has any kind of arsenal. . .

116
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,024
. . .we'd move in on him.

117
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:41,903
Besides, Han would never allow guns
on the island anyway.

118
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:46,616
He had a bad experience with them once
and he's fearful of assassination.

119
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:51,204
You can't really blame him.
Any bloody fool can pull a trigger.

120
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,707
I guess I won't need anything.

121
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,168
There's a radio on the island.
We'll monitor it. . .

122
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,254
. . .on the chance you can get to it.

123
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,839
And then you come?

124
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,259
Someone will.

125
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,594
We aren't an agency of enforcement.

126
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,932
We function as gatherers
of information, evidence.

127
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,352
Upon which interested
governments can act.

128
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,065
I see. If there's any trouble,
you make a phone call.

129
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,443
Oh, by the way, two months ago. . .

130
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:26,031
. . .we managed to place a female operative
on the island.

131
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,366
Since then, we've lost her.

132
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,952
If she's there, she might have something.

133
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,705
Name's Mei Ling.

134
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:38,043
-Sure you won't have one?
-No, thanks.

135
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:21,169
But now the time has come to tell you
something very difficult.

136
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:26,424
I'm happy you have decided to go
to Han's tournament.

137
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,593
Yeah.

138
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:33,723
The last of the tournaments
were held three years ago.

139
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:39,062
I was in the city with your sister
at that time.

140
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,483
I didn't know that.

141
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,860
Yes.

142
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,656
Many of Han's men
had come in from the island.

143
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:54,202
They were everywhere,
bullying and arrogant.

144
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,539
We were on our way into town.

145
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,733
Stay back!

146
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,739
Run ! Run !

147
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,742
Now!

148
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:59,530
Now you know the truth.

149
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,116
When you get to the city. . .

150
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:07,288
. . . pay your respects to your sister
and your mother.

151
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,128
I will, old man.

152
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:36,067
You will not agree with
what I am going to do.

153
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:41,155
It is contrary to all
that you have taught me. . .

154
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,328
. . .and all that Su Lin believed.

155
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,839
I must leave.

156
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,846
Please try to find a way to forgive me.

157
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,621
Double or nothing?

158
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,916
That's about 1000 bucks a foot, Roper.

159
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,920
Why not?

160
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:40,107
I'm sorry, Mr. Roper isn't in right now.
May I take a message?

161
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,925
That's a tough shot, Mr. Roper.

162
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,306
Excuse me, fellas.

163
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,726
-I say he can't make it.
-What'll you bet?

164
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,396
You gotta love him.

165
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:23,693
Come on, Roper.
It's 175 big ones by Monday the 15th.

166
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,112
Only 150.

167
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,739
You forget interest.

168
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:33,160
-Maybe I ought to talk to Freddie.
-You take advantage, Roper.

169
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,162
Come on, fellas.

170
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,165
It's the dough, Roper,
or we gotta break something.

171
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,294
You got it?

172
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,340
Freddie says this is for your own good.

173
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,992
Better confirm that flight
to Hong Kong for me.

174
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:19,540
-How much do I have left in the bank?
-$63.43.

175
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,960
-It's all yours.
-Thanks.

176
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:26,589
-Only, I think you'll need it.
-You wanna bet?

177
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,975
Double-punching. Ready. . . .

178
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,968
Going on a trip, are you?

179
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:47,938
-Hey, this jig's got a passport.
-Where you going, jig?

180
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:54,195
-Where's the plane ticket for?
-Hong Kong, via Hawaii.

181
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,614
He's not going to Hawaii.

182
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,119
Well, look what we got here!

183
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,997
Assaulting a police officer.

184
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,551
-Hey, soldier, shape it up!
-Roper! Hey, how are you, man?

185
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:02,763
How am I, man? How am I?
I'm glad to see you, that's how I am.

186
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:06,600
-Hey, how long has it been? Five. . .?
-Six years, man.

187
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,602
-Six.
-It's not as long as it seems.

188
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,229
Yeah, I know what you mean.

189
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:14,191
-What you been doing since Nam?
-Hanging in a little bit.

190
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,443
-All these yours?
-Always first-class.

191
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,279
Same old Roper.

192
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,077
Come here.

193
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:31,500
-Parsons.
-Yeah, from New Zealand.

194
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:34,545
This man's putting
quite a collection together.

195
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,630
Know him?

196
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,674
Never saw him before.

197
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,303
What do you know about this Han cat?

198
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,098
Just rumors. I hear he likes to live big.

199
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,771
They don't live so big over there.

200
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,482
Ghettos are the same all over the world.

201
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,943
They stink.

202
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,238
Same old Williams.

203
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,617
Yeah.

204
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,453
What have we got here? A little action.

205
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:36,125
Insects. Okay, I'll lay you 50 bucks
on the big one.

206
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,378
Fifty. $50 on the big one, all right?

207
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,130
I'll give you 5-to-1.

208
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,465
Would you bet 100?

209
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,593
You're on.

210
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,146
Come on, let's end this thing quickly.

211
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:01,358
Thattababy. Come on. Come on !

212
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:06,238
That's it. Just get him on his back.
Get him on his back! Come on.

213
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:09,867
Come on. Give up!
Come on ! Hey.

214
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:14,997
Oh, for crying out loud.
Would you believe that?

215
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,669
Dumb shit.

216
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,556
Do I bother you?

217
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,142
Don't waste yourself.

218
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:22,147
-What's your style?
-My style?

219
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,984
You can call it the art of fighting
without fighting.

220
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,821
"The art of fighting without fighting"?

221
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,782
-Show me some of it.
-Later.

222
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,833
All right.

223
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,503
Don't you think we need more room?

224
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,132
Where else?

225
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:54,304
That island, on the beach.
We can take this boat.

226
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,605
Okay.

227
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:20,539
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
Hey, are you crazy?

228
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,460
Pull me in ! Pull me in !

229
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:31,800
Don't try to pull yourself up
or I'll let go of the line.

230
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,404
Would you look at that.

231
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:42,579
A woman like that could teach you
a lot about yourself.

232
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,771
Welcome.

233
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,997
This way.

234
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:13,879
I'll show you to your rooms.
The banquet begins promptly at 8.

235
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:17,257
I think you'll find our little island
quite charming.

236
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:18,462
Say, I hope you haven't spent all
that money you won from me yesterday.

237
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,173
-I plan to win it back.
-Oh? How?

238
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,302
You'll find out, after you've lost it.

239
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:29,097
You seem to be very much
at home here, Mr. Roper.

240
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,684
This guy Han's got a great sense
of hospitality.

241
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,604
And a fantastic sense of style.

242
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,316
Yeah, it's great.

243
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,359
Then why are you so apprehensive?

244
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:43,320
Apprehensive?

245
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:48,325
No. I was just wondering
whether it was okay to drink the water.

246
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:52,245
Mr. Roper, don't con me.

247
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,705
Wanna bet?

248
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:08,512
No. I really don't think so. Thanks.

249
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,889
What's the matter, you on a diet?

250
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,559
I'd like to eat, if I could
find something I could keep down.

251
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:20,232
Well, I can't wait to meet our host.
I hear this is only one of his B parties.

252
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:23,735
You ever been to
a martial arts tournament like this?

253
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,613
Never.

254
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:30,075
I have a funny feeling we're being
fattened up for the kill.

255
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:34,496
Better keep an eye out for the referee.

256
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:37,082
-Know what I mean?
-Yeah.

257
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:16,079
Gentlemen, welcome.

258
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,790
You honor our island.

259
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:22,627
I look forward to a tournament. . .

260
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:26,131
. . .of truly epic proportions.

261
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:29,092
We are unique, gentlemen. . .

262
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,387
. . . in that we create ourselves. . .

263
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:35,432
. . .through long years
of rigorous training. . .

264
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,560
. . .sacrifice, denial, pain.

265
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:43,815
We forge our bodies
in the fire of our will.

266
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:47,277
But tonight, let us celebrate.

267
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:53,283
Gentlemen, you have our gratitude.

268
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,394
Mr. Williams.

269
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,863
Mr. Williams!

270
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,499
For me?

271
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,587
You shouldn't have.

272
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,048
But. . . .

273
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,969
I'll take you, darling.

274
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:49,607
And you.

275
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:56,281
Please understand, if I missed anyone. . .

276
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,867
. . . it's been a big day.

277
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,618
I'm a little tired.

278
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:04,831
Oh, of course, Mr. Williams.

279
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:08,668
You must conserve your strength.

280
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,881
Come in.

281
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,221
A gift, Mr. Lee.

282
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:32,650
-If you don't see anything you like. . . .
-There was a girl at the feast tonight.

283
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,152
Which girl, sir?

284
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,322
The owner of this dart.

285
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:42,327
Oh, yes. I know the one.

286
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,496
I'll send her to you.

287
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:55,006
Another fine mess you got me into.

288
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,220
Come in.

289
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,735
Hi.

290
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:20,114
Well, well, one more lovely than the next.

291
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:22,158
What did you have in mind?

292
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:24,202
Pick one.

293
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,998
I already have.

294
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,336
Wise decision.

295
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:49,352
I wanna talk to you, Mei Ling.

296
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,647
Where do you come from?

297
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:55,316
-Braithwaite--
-Let's be quiet.

298
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:56,860
Have you seen anything?

299
00:44:57,152 --> 00:45:01,531
Nothing much.
I'm kept in the palace, watched always.

300
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:05,076
I know nothing of Han's activities
away from the palace.

301
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:08,329
But I can tell you this: people disappear.

302
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:11,749
-Who?
-The girls. Every one of them.

303
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:16,170
They're summoned to Han's at night
and the next day they're gone.

304
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,841
I know I don't have much time.

305
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:38,026
You must attend the morning ritual
in uniform.

306
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:40,111
Outside.

307
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:03,801
Mr. Lee, why you no wear uniform?

308
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,697
Gentlemen, let the tournament begin !

309
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,663
Bolo.

310
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:47,423
Good work. You made me some bread.

311
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,842
-Mr. Roper.
-I'm ready.

312
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,636
Okay.

313
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:56,974
I got myself a real pigeon here.

314
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,727
Keep the action going for me, will you?

315
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,771
What do you think, Roper?

316
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:07,318
Oh, no sweat.
Give my friend 8-to-3 all the way.

317
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:00,014
I'm finding out about myself.

318
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:03,267
This is the real me, definitely.

319
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:05,436
Do you like it here?

320
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,772
Oh, yeah. But a little lower.

321
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:11,609
No. I mean here on the island.

322
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:15,446
Yeah, I like it here.
But a little lower.

323
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:18,115
A man like you belongs here.

324
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,917
To you, I'm just another pretty face.

325
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:01,492
Where you go?

326
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,119
Out in the moonlight, baby.

327
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:07,915
-It is not allowed. You must stay.
-Oh?

328
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,459
Goodbye.

329
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:54,011
A human fly.

330
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:59,266
Gentlemen. . .

331
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:02,269
. . . it seems that one of you. . .

332
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:05,814
. . .was not content last night. . .

333
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:10,527
. . .with the hospitality of the palace. . .

334
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:17,368
. . .and sought diversion
elsewhere on the island.

335
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:22,164
Who it was is not important. . .

336
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,416
. . .at this time.

337
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:28,045
What is important is that. . .

338
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:34,593
. . . my guards performed
their duties incompetently.

339
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:37,554
And now they must prove. . .

340
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:42,726
. . .themselves worthy
to remain among us.

341
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:29,041
Are you shocked, Mr. Williams?

342
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:32,461
Only at how sloppy your man works.

343
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:38,008
Mr. Lee?

344
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:42,137
Are you ready?

345
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:23,804
Boards don't hit back.

346
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:30,435
-Bolo.
-Go!

347
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,086
Oharra!

348
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:40,417
Oharra's treachery has disgraced us.

349
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:02,647
If you wanna talk about this thing,
I'll be in my room.

350
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:04,608
Gotcha.

351
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:10,697
Williams? Williams.

352
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:14,409
-Go to Han's study as soon as possible.
-All right.

353
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:21,416
Hey, Roper.
I'll see you in half an hour.

354
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,210
Right.

355
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:34,554
-Mr. Han?
-You fought well yesterday.

356
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:37,974
Your style is unorthodox.

357
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:39,518
But effective.

358
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:43,980
It is not the art,
but the combat that you enjoy.

359
01:05:45,149 --> 01:05:46,942
The winning.

360
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:50,237
We are all ready to win. . .

361
01:05:50,404 --> 01:05:54,241
. . .just as we are born
knowing only life.

362
01:05:55,952 --> 01:06:00,914
It is defeat that you must learn
to prepare for.

363
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:04,793
I don't waste my time with it.

364
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,921
When it comes, I won't even notice.

365
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:09,714
Oh? How so?

366
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:12,926
I'll be too busy looking good.

367
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:17,055
What were you looking for
when you attacked my guards?

368
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:19,141
Wasn't me.

369
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:22,936
You were the only man
outside the palace.

370
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:27,566
I was outside, but I wasn't the only one.

371
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:30,068
You will tell me who else.

372
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:34,781
Mr. Han, suddenly
I'd like to leave your island.

373
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:39,077
-It is not possible.
-Bullshit, Mr. Han-Man !

374
01:06:45,459 --> 01:06:49,254
Man, you come right out of a comic book.

375
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:14,613
Been practicing, huh?

376
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:05,223
-Williams is expecting me in my room.
-I wanted to talk to you.

377
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:08,268
We will meet your friend Williams later.

378
01:09:08,436 --> 01:09:11,980
-Okay.
-This is my museum.

379
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:15,567
It is difficult
to associate these horrors. . .

380
01:09:15,735 --> 01:09:18,611
. . .with the proud civilizations
that created them:

381
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:23,950
Sparta, Rome, the knights of Europe,
the samurai.

382
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:27,912
They worship strength
because it is strength. . .

383
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:31,166
. . .that makes all other values possible.

384
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:34,377
Nothing survives without it.

385
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:38,923
Who knows what delicate wonders
have died out of the world. . .

386
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:41,968
. . .for want of the strength to survive.

387
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:43,970
What's this?

388
01:09:48,642 --> 01:09:50,518
A souvenir.

389
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:03,782
-Up here.
-A guillotine? No, thanks.

390
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:06,534
This is the only angle I care
to see it from.

391
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:09,162
If you please, Mr. Roper.

392
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:13,958
You want me to put my head
on that thing?

393
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,795
An act of faith.

394
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:21,508
I'm a man of little faith, Mr. Han.

395
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:41,069
Very few people can be totally ruthless.
It isn't easy.

396
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,988
It takes more strength
than you might believe.

397
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:07,387
Now you've got eight more.

398
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:19,065
Then there is a point
you will not go beyond.

399
01:11:23,154 --> 01:11:25,029
Faked out again.

400
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:36,040
This way.

401
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:48,720
Our power plant.

402
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:03,318
Oh, yeah.

403
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:06,946
A lifetime of women, huh?

404
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:09,741
A man's strength
can be measured by his appetites.

405
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:13,745
Indeed, a man's strength flows
from his appetites.

406
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:17,248
Oh, no. They are my daughters.

407
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:21,127
Your daughters?

408
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:27,342
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that--
I misunderstood. Miss Han?

409
01:12:32,264 --> 01:12:35,600
And also,
they are my most personal guard.

410
01:12:36,101 --> 01:12:38,228
I admire your judgment.

411
01:12:38,395 --> 01:12:42,106
Nobody's as loyal as daddy's little girl.

412
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:45,193
-Mr. Roper?
-No, thanks.

413
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:48,279
I'll get up myself.

414
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:50,448
Nice meeting you.

415
01:12:58,832 --> 01:13:00,833
Opium.

416
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:07,799
We are investing in corruption, Mr. Roper.

417
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:11,469
The business of corruption
is like any other.

418
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:12,971
Oh, yeah.

419
01:13:13,138 --> 01:13:18,017
Provide your customers
with products they need. . .

420
01:13:18,185 --> 01:13:22,146
. . .and encourage that need a little bit
to stimulate your market. . .

421
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:25,900
. . . pretty soon your customers
depend on you. I mean, really need you.

422
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:28,152
It's the law of economics.

423
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,988
Right.

424
01:13:30,155 --> 01:13:34,075
And here we are stimulating
quite another need.

425
01:13:51,176 --> 01:13:55,179
You wonder why I am exposing
so much of myself?

426
01:13:55,347 --> 01:13:58,600
I forget what I see very easily.

427
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:00,059
But then, why are you?

428
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:05,607
I'm hoping you'll join us,
represent us in the United States.

429
01:14:07,026 --> 01:14:11,029
I'm beginning to understand the thing
with the tournament. The whole setup.

430
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:14,032
It's a great way
to recruit new talent, huh?

431
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:21,873
And who are they?

432
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:26,544
The refuse found in waterfront bars.

433
01:14:27,338 --> 01:14:29,339
Shanghaied?

434
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:36,137
Just lost, drunken men who no longer care
where they find themselves each morning.

435
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:47,565
You left some rather
sizable debts in America.

436
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:51,235
Diners Club hasn't called in my card yet.

437
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:07,085
There were some questions
which I was forced to ask.

438
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:09,504
I got no answers.

439
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:32,110
And you want me to join this?

440
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:34,445
There are certain realities.

441
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:38,950
I want us to have a clear understanding.

442
01:15:51,171 --> 01:15:52,839
No.

443
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:56,634
There's no misunderstanding between us.

444
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:12,103
Help me. Help, I'm 17!

445
01:18:12,437 --> 01:18:16,190
I'm from California.
Help me! Please, help me!

446
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:20,319
Mister, come back, please!
You have to come back. Please!

447
01:18:20,487 --> 01:18:25,783
-Help me! Help me!
-Hey, quiet! Shut up!

448
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:23,140
The battle with the guards
was magnificent.

449
01:24:23,808 --> 01:24:26,810
Your skill is extraordinary.

450
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,482
And I was going to ask you to join us.

451
01:24:47,499 --> 01:24:51,835
My God. This came in half an hour ago.
Why didn't I--?

452
01:24:52,379 --> 01:24:55,381
Hello. Put your colonel on.

453
01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:58,175
Well, wake him up.

454
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:02,763
I don't care if he's not alone.

455
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:09,103
Damn it all, I don't care who he's with !
You bloody well put him on the line!

456
01:25:34,921 --> 01:25:39,550
Good morning, Mr. Roper.
We have been waiting for you.

457
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:41,885
What's going on?

458
01:25:42,053 --> 01:25:46,307
Would you be good enough to participate
in this morning's edification?

459
01:25:46,599 --> 01:25:47,891
Edification.

460
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:55,649
What are you gonna do to him?

461
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:59,236
Not me, Mr. Roper. You.

462
01:26:02,073 --> 01:26:03,824
Bolo?

463
01:26:41,946 --> 01:26:43,947
Like you said. . .

464
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:46,784
. . .there's a point I won't go beyond.

465
01:26:47,118 --> 01:26:49,286
I was right about you.

466
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:53,791
We shall strive to be worthy
of your sense of grandeur.

467
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:57,378
I will find someone with whom
you can fight.

468
01:26:57,587 --> 01:26:59,088
Bolo.

469
01:29:19,646 --> 01:29:21,230
Quick, go destroy them. Kill !

470
01:29:51,344 --> 01:29:53,178
Kill them !

471
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:01,311
Kill ! Fools!

472
01:32:48,813 --> 01:32:54,651
You have offended my family
and you have offended a Shaolin temple.

473
01:38:23,481 --> 01:38:25,398
Remember...

474
01:38:25,566 --> 01:38:28,693
...the enemy has only images
and illusions...

475
01:38:28,861 --> 01:38:33,156
...behind which
he hides his true motives.

476
01:38:33,574 --> 01:38:38,661
Destroy the image
and you will break the enemy.
