both the living

Give us the strength and the wisdom

In God's name we pray.

When Agave sobered up,

29
00:01:51,536 --> 00:01:53,299
she looked down and saw
the head of her son Pentheus

30
00:01:53,372 --> 00:01:56,398
- right there in her hands.
- She thought he was a wild animal.

31
00:01:56,475 --> 00:01:58,272
That's how Dionysus got his revenge.

I believe we are the most privileged
people in America,

Who wrote that?

102
00:06:54,055 --> 00:06:55,454
Langston Hughes, 1924.

103
00:06:55,523 --> 00:06:57,957

107
00:07:16,246 --> 00:07:18,840
Gwendolyn Bennett wrote that.

108
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:22,052
She was born in 1902.

109
00:07:22,052 --> 00:07:24,680
Unofficially.

110
00:07:24,755 --> 00:07:26,552
You see, in most states,

111
00:07:26,623 --> 00:07:28,420
Negroes were denied birth certificates,

112
00:07:28,492 --> 00:07:31,086
which means I can
lie about my age the rest of my life.

114

You think that's funny?

115
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:38,597
To be born...

116
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:40,796
without record.

117
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:44,703
Mr. Reed, hand these out.

00:07:44,776 --> 00:07:47,404
I'm going to introduce you
to some new voices this semester.

119
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:49,844
There's a revolution going on.

120
00:07:49,947 --> 00:07:52,245
In the North. In Harlem.

121
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,875
They're changing the way
Negroes in America think.

122
00:07:54,986 --> 00:07:58,183
I'm talking about poets
like Hughes, Bennett,

123
00:07:58,256 --> 00:08:00,622
Zora Neale Hurston, Countee Cullen...

in the middle of the night

00:08:34,128 --> 00:08:35,789
dressed like a cotton-chopper?

What is a student doing
in the middle of the night

133
00:08:37,998 --> 00:08:39,158
throwing his life away?

134
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:41,201
It's funny. I thought
I was defending myself.

135
00:08:41,268 --> 00:08:43,634
Mm.

136
00:08:43,704 --> 00:08:46,901
I remember you.

137
00:08:46,974 --> 00:08:49,636
Couple of years ago.
Then you disappeared.

138
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,802
What happened?

139
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:53,676
I come and go whenever it suits me.

140
00:08:53,747 --> 00:08:55,806
- Suspensions?
- Leaves of absence.

141
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,153
Why'd you come back?

142
00:08:59,222 --> 00:09:01,588
School's the only place
you can read all day.

143

Except prison.

144

I want you to come by
my house tonight, 7:30.

145
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:10,298
- Corner of June and Campus.
- Why would I do that?

146
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:12,596
Holding tryouts for the debate team.

147
00:09:15,104 --> 00:09:18,301
- You sure you want somebody like me?
- No.

148
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:20,934
That's why you're trying out.

150
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:24,341

[Professor]
Of the 360 students here at Wiley College,

155
00:10:04,523 --> 00:10:08,619
only 45 of you were brave enough
to try out for the debate team.

156
00:10:08,727 --> 00:10:11,423
Of that 45, only four
of you will remain standing

157
00:10:11,497 --> 00:10:13,590
when the tryouts are over... why?

158
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:16,794
Because debate is
blood sport. It's combat.

159
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,031
But your weapons are words.

160
00:10:19,105 --> 00:10:20,470
[Knocking]
Come on in.

Now that Mr. Farmer
has joined us, we can begin.

00:10:22,776 --> 00:10:24,073
Sit down, Mr. Farmer.

163
00:10:24,144 --> 00:10:26,510
Not right there. Over there.

164
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,411
- Yes, sir.
- James. Right this way.

165
00:10:28,481 --> 00:10:30,540
Good evening, Mrs. Tolson.

166
00:10:30,617 --> 00:10:32,585
- Evening.
- Excuse me.

167
00:10:32,652 --> 00:10:34,051
We're waiting for you, Mr. Farmer.

168
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,587
I'm going, sir.

169
00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:39,056
Thank you, Mr. Farmer.
You smell very good, Mr. Farmer.

170
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,491
- Thank you, sir.
- You're very welcome.

171
00:10:41,562 --> 00:10:43,359
Gentlemen and lady.

172
00:10:43,431 --> 00:10:45,661
This is...

173
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:49,726
the hot spot.

174
00:10:49,804 --> 00:10:53,672
You will enter it at your own risk.

175
00:10:53,741 --> 00:10:55,936
Mr. Tolson, what about
the debaters from last year?

176
00:10:56,011 --> 00:10:57,501
Don't ask a question you
already know the answer to.

177
00:10:57,579 --> 00:10:58,841
Get up here. You'll be first.

178
00:10:58,914 --> 00:11:00,506
Get right here. Hot spot.

179
00:11:00,582 --> 00:11:02,607
Debate starts with a proposition.

180
00:11:02,684 --> 00:11:04,208
With an idea..."Resolved:

181
00:11:04,286 --> 00:11:08,017
Child labor should be regulated
by the federal government."

182
00:11:08,091 --> 00:11:10,150
The first debater argues
the affirmative.

183
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,887
Affirmative means
that you are for something.

184
00:11:11,995 --> 00:11:13,519
Mr. Reed will argue the affirmative.

185
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,257
The second debater
argues the negative.

186
00:11:15,365 --> 00:11:16,798
Negative means that you are what?

187
00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:17,798
Against.

188
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:19,698
Brilliant, Mr. Burgess.

189
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:22,738
You shall argue
the affirmative, Mr. Reed. Go.

190
00:11:22,805 --> 00:11:27,299
Well, sir, I'd begin with a quote
from the poet Cleghorn.

191
00:11:27,377 --> 00:11:31,575
"The golf links lie so near the mill,

192
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:34,947
"that almost every day,

193
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,615
"the laboring children
can look out and...

194
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,555
and..."

195
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:44,356
# And watch the men at play #

196
00:11:44,462 --> 00:11:46,930
Is that what you learned
from last year, Mr. Reed?

197
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,262
To start something,
and not finish it?

198
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,892
- Is it?
- No, sir.

199
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,663
Sit down.

200
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:59,167
Who's next? You? Stand up.

201
00:11:59,244 --> 00:12:01,644
Stand up.

202
00:12:03,081 --> 00:12:05,447
It's getting late.
How much longer can you hide?

203
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,951
I'm not hiding, sir.
I transferred from my college

204
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,646
just to come here
and try out for your team.

205
00:12:09,721 --> 00:12:11,052
I am deeply moved. What's your name?

206
00:12:11,122 --> 00:12:12,612
Samantha Booke.

207
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:13,988
- Book?
- With an "e."

208
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,518
Arise, Miss Booke. With an "e."

209
00:12:18,564 --> 00:12:22,967
Into the hot spot,
Miss Booke with an "e."

210
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:27,028
You know, there's never been a female
on the debating team, ever.

211
00:12:27,107 --> 00:12:28,734
Yes, sir. I know that.

212
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:31,175
What makes you think
you should be the first?

213
00:12:31,244 --> 00:12:33,508
Because, sir, I am just as qualified as...

214
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:35,310
- quit stammering, Miss Booke.
...anybody else here.

215
00:12:35,383 --> 00:12:37,112
- My gender has nothing...
- "Resolved:

216
00:12:37,185 --> 00:12:39,949
Welfare discourages hard work."

217
00:12:40,021 --> 00:12:43,149
- You'll argue the negative.
- All right.

218
00:12:43,224 --> 00:12:46,921
Welfare takes away a man's
strongest reason for working,

219
00:12:46,994 --> 00:12:49,588
which is survival.

220
00:12:49,697 --> 00:12:51,255
And that weakens the will of the poor.

221
00:12:51,366 --> 00:12:54,469
How would you rebut that,
Miss Booke with an "e"?

222
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,563
I would say it does not.

223
00:12:56,672 --> 00:12:59,732
Most of the New Deal
goes to children, anyway,

224
00:12:59,808 --> 00:13:01,969
and to the handicapped,
and to old people...

225
00:13:02,044 --> 00:13:03,477
- Is that fact, or conjecture?
- It is a fact.

226
00:13:03,545 --> 00:13:05,945
- Speak up.
- It is a fact.

227
00:13:06,014 --> 00:13:07,777
- What's your source?
- The president.

228
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,216
- Of the United States?
- Yes, sir.

229
00:13:10,285 --> 00:13:13,448
That's your primary source? You spoke
to President Roosevelt personally?

230
00:13:13,522 --> 00:13:15,922
Of course not. I did not
speak to him personally,

231
00:13:15,991 --> 00:13:17,583
but I listened to his Fireside Chat.

232
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,561
- Oh, a radio broadcast.
- Yes.

233
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,791
- Any other sources?
- Well...

234
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:24,867
Any other sources?

235
00:13:27,203 --> 00:13:29,296
Yes, there are other sources.

236
00:13:29,406 --> 00:13:32,102
Like that look in a mother's eyes
when she can't feed her kids.

237
00:13:32,175 --> 00:13:35,611
Without welfare, Mr. Tolson,
people would be starving.

238
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:36,839
Who's starving, Miss Booke?

239
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:39,280
- The unemployed are starving.
- Mr. Burgess here.

240
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,716
He's unemployed.
Obviously, he's not starving.

241
00:13:43,554 --> 00:13:45,818
I drew you in, Miss Booke.

242
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:49,621
You gave a faulty premise,
so your syllogism fell apart.

243
00:13:49,693 --> 00:13:51,627
- "Syllogism"?
- Your logic fell apart.

244
00:13:51,695 --> 00:13:53,663
Major premise:
The unemployed are starving.

245
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:56,222
Minor premise:
Mr. Burgess is unemployed.

246
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,824
Conclusion: Mr. Burgess is starving.

247
00:13:58,936 --> 00:14:01,769
Your major premise was
based on a faulty assumption.

248
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,638
Classic fallacy. Who's next?

249
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,180
[Whispers]
You were right.

250
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:15,482
[Tolson]
Tell us your name.

251
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:17,854
I'm Henry Lowe. With an "e."

252
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:21,861
All right, Mr. Lowe. I will name a subject.

253
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:24,625
You speak a few words...
a pertinent quote from world literature.

254
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:25,926
Go ahead.

255
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:29,259
Beauty.

256
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,761
"I heard the old, old men say,

257
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:35,239
all that is beautiful
drifts away, like the waters."

258
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,709
Very good.

259
00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:40,975
History. And name
the author this time.

260
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:44,142
"History is a nightmare,
from which I am trying to awake."

261
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:45,583
James Joyce.

262
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:50,350
Self-pity.

263
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:57,827
"I never saw a wild thing
sorry for itself."

264
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:59,196
D.H. Lawrence.

265
00:15:01,002 --> 00:15:03,835
[Whispers]
I love D.H. Lawrence. Have you ever read...

266
00:15:03,873 --> 00:15:04,931
Mr. Farmer.

267
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,099
Yes, sir?

268
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:10,645
I have eyes in the back of my head
and ears on both sides. Stand up.

269
00:15:13,082 --> 00:15:17,451
Tell me the irony in the name
"Bethlehem Steel Corporation."

270
00:15:19,488 --> 00:15:23,788
Bethlehem is the birthplace of Jesus,
Prince of Peace,

271
00:15:23,859 --> 00:15:26,692
and Bethlehem Steel
makes weapons of war.

272
00:15:26,763 --> 00:15:29,231
Very good. Sit down.

273
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,389
Good.

274
00:15:31,469 --> 00:15:33,164
[Tolson]
Who's next?

275
00:15:33,304 --> 00:15:35,101
That went well.
How will we know how we did?

276
00:15:35,172 --> 00:15:37,834
- [Chattering]
- Samantha.

277
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,378
Samantha.

278
00:15:43,748 --> 00:15:45,943
Tolson's tough, isn't he?

279
00:15:46,017 --> 00:15:48,008
He sure is.

280
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,087
I'm James.

281
00:15:52,156 --> 00:15:54,215
Is your father Dr. James Farmer?

282
00:15:54,292 --> 00:15:56,283
Yes... yes, he is.

283
00:15:56,361 --> 00:15:59,762
I'm taking theology from him,
and that man speaks in tongues.

284
00:15:59,831 --> 00:16:01,890
French, Greek, Hebrew, Latin...

285
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:03,628
How many languages
does he speak?

286
00:16:03,702 --> 00:16:07,798
- Seven languages.
- "Seven languages."

287
00:16:07,873 --> 00:16:10,706
He must be the smartest man in Texas.

288
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,710
Well, that's not saying much.

289
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:16,815
So why do you want
to be on the team?

290
00:16:16,883 --> 00:16:20,478
- I think it would be good training.
- For what?

291
00:16:20,553 --> 00:16:22,885
Bein' a lawyer.

292
00:16:22,956 --> 00:16:25,516
Lawyer? That's great.

293
00:16:25,592 --> 00:16:28,459
You know how many Negro
women practice law in this state?

294
00:16:28,528 --> 00:16:29,790
- Two.
- Exactly.

295
00:16:29,862 --> 00:16:31,887
One of them's my aunt.

296
00:16:31,965 --> 00:16:34,593
Well, look at you, Mr. Farmer.

297
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:36,225
How old are you, anyway?

298
00:16:36,302 --> 00:16:38,896
I'll be 16...

299
00:16:38,972 --> 00:16:40,234
in 21 months.
[Chuckles]

300
00:16:40,306 --> 00:16:44,640
Young lady. James.
I just wanted to thank you.

301
00:16:44,744 --> 00:16:46,439
For what?

302
00:16:46,546 --> 00:16:48,138
Well, for your performance tonight.

303
00:16:48,248 --> 00:16:50,307
I mean, how many other students
ever stand up to Tolson?

304
00:16:50,418 --> 00:16:51,680
- I did.
- No.

305
00:16:51,753 --> 00:16:55,052
You answered a question,
and I spouted a few quotes.

306
00:16:55,124 --> 00:16:57,149
Miss Booke with an "e,"

307
00:16:57,226 --> 00:17:00,161
- she fought back.
- And lost!

308
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:02,390
But you didn't have to lose.

309
00:17:02,465 --> 00:17:05,559
Why isn't a Fireside Chat
a legitimate source?

310
00:17:05,635 --> 00:17:08,035
Because Tolson says so?

311
00:17:08,104 --> 00:17:12,768
Nobody has better access
to those statistics than the president.

312
00:17:12,842 --> 00:17:17,245
Now, if you'd have called Tolson on that,
you would have won.

313
00:17:17,346 --> 00:17:22,079
I don't know. I'm sure that man
would have come up with something.

314
00:17:22,151 --> 00:17:23,914
Good night, James.

315
00:17:23,986 --> 00:17:25,647
[Samantha]
Can you believe he's

316
00:17:25,721 --> 00:17:27,780
- Good night, Samantha.
- 14 years old, and he's in college?

317
00:17:30,093 --> 00:17:32,857
You are gifted, all of you.

318
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:35,397
So I want you to know that I chose
this team for balance,

319
00:17:35,465 --> 00:17:38,491
and none of you should
take it as a failure...

320
00:17:38,568 --> 00:17:40,695
as a denigration of your intellect.

321
00:17:40,772 --> 00:17:42,103
Denigrate. There's a word for you.

322
00:17:42,173 --> 00:17:45,108
From the Latin word "niger,"
to defame, to blacken.

323
00:17:45,176 --> 00:17:47,201
It's always there, isn't it?
Even in the dictionary.

324
00:17:47,278 --> 00:17:50,736
Even in the speech
of a Negro professor.

325
00:17:50,848 --> 00:17:54,978
Somehow, "black" is always
equated with failure.

326
00:17:55,086 --> 00:17:57,611
Well, write your own dictionary.

And finally...

Junior, slow down.

338
00:18:34,895 --> 00:18:36,988

- Quiet. He's writing a lecture.

- Dad.
- Junior.

What is the greatest
weakness of man?

Not believing? Doubt?

That's it. Thank you, Junior.

"O you of little faith,
why do you doubt me?"

Dad?

What is it, son?

I made the debate team.

Well, congratulations.

350
00:19:12,968 --> 00:19:14,868
And who is on your team?

351
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:18,303
Um, there's four of us.
I'm one of the alternates.

352
00:19:19,307 --> 00:19:20,296
Who's ahead of you?

353
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,866
Hamilton Burgess and Henry Lowe.

354
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:25,572
And the other alternate's
Samantha Booke.

355
00:19:25,647 --> 00:19:27,308
There's a girl?

356
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:29,578
She wants to be a lawyer.

357
00:19:29,686 --> 00:19:32,450
- A lawyer?
- She's very intelligent.

358
00:19:35,025 --> 00:19:37,152
Is she pretty?

359

I don't know.
I never really noticed.

360
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:43,623
Because extracurricular activities
like the debate team are fine,

361
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,134
but you must not take
your eye off the ball, son.

- Yes, sir.
- Hmph.

00:19:49,574 --> 00:19:52,441
So what do we do here?

364
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,843
We do what we have to do,
so we can do what we want to do.

What do you have to do right now?

366
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,247

to go to college at Boston University.

in front of the remaining male niggers,
female niggers,

and nigger infants.

500

Tar and feather him.

Tie each leg to a horse
facing an opposite direction,

No one?

512
00:27:09,571 --> 00:27:11,835
He was a vicious slave owner
in the West Indies.

513
00:27:11,906 --> 00:27:14,340
The slave-masters
in the colony of Virginia

514
00:27:14,409 --> 00:27:16,741
were having trouble
controlling their slaves,

515
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:20,303
so they sent for Mr. Lynch
to teach them his methods.

516
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:23,908
The word "lynching"
came from his last name.

517
00:27:24,021 --> 00:27:28,219
His methods were very simple,
but they were diabolical.

518
00:27:28,292 --> 00:27:32,353
Keep the slave physically strong
but psychologically weak

519
00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:34,124
and dependent on the slave master.

520
00:27:34,197 --> 00:27:37,598
Keep the body, take the mind.

00:38:19,143 --> 00:38:22,601
She said Tolson was gone
and that you weren't there.

649
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,911
So I'm going to give you another chance.

650
00:38:27,285 --> 00:38:28,946
Where were you?

651
00:38:29,053 --> 00:38:31,021
I can't tell you, sir.

652
00:38:31,122 --> 00:38:32,350
Good Lord, boy.

653
00:38:32,424 --> 00:38:34,517
We've been worried to death about you.

654
00:38:34,593 --> 00:38:35,560
Junior...

655
00:38:37,197 --> 00:38:39,165
where were you?

656
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,497
I can't tell you, sir.

657
00:38:42,569 --> 00:38:43,501
Why not?

658
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,162
I don't know.

659
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,399
"I don't know."

660
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:51,501
"I don't know" is not
an acceptable answer, Junior.

661
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,012
Junior.

662
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,139
Silence is not an option, either.

663
00:38:56,517 --> 00:38:58,451
Son, you been drinking?

664
00:38:58,552 --> 00:38:59,678
Honey...

665
00:38:59,787 --> 00:39:01,880
Because you must've been drinking
coming up in my house

666
00:39:02,056 --> 00:39:05,548
talking about you don't want to tell me
where you been at 1:30 in the morning?

667
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,855
Baby, tell me, what's the matter?

668
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,053
Mom, nothing's the matter.

669
00:39:08,129 --> 00:39:09,153
Something's the matter!

670
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,255
Something is wrong!

671
00:39:11,332 --> 00:39:12,594
Were you with that girl?

672
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:14,327
- You were with that girl.
- No.

673
00:39:14,402 --> 00:39:16,267
Because you're 14 years old, Junior.

674
00:39:16,338 --> 00:39:18,329
You've got plenty of time for girls later.

675
00:39:18,407 --> 00:39:19,601
I wasn't with Samantha.

676
00:39:19,674 --> 00:39:20,766
Junior.

677
00:39:22,711 --> 00:39:24,406
Then where were you?

678
00:39:27,549 --> 00:39:29,574
Where were you, honey?

679
00:39:31,353 --> 00:39:32,547
You don't want to talk?

680
00:39:32,654 --> 00:39:34,986
Fine.

681
00:39:35,057 --> 00:39:36,718
But you're not leaving this house.

682
00:39:36,826 --> 00:39:38,259
What do you mean?

683
00:39:38,327 --> 00:39:39,294
Just what I said.

684
00:39:39,395 --> 00:39:42,091
You're not leaving this house
until you tell me the truth!

685
00:39:42,165 --> 00:39:43,393
What about school?

686
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:45,331
Don't go questioning
what I just said, boy!

687
00:39:45,401 --> 00:39:46,333
Mom, what about school?

688
00:39:46,402 --> 00:39:47,334
And don't raise your voice!

689
00:39:47,403 --> 00:39:48,392
I'm not raising my voice!

690
00:39:48,471 --> 00:39:49,802
You raising your voice in the house?

691
00:39:49,872 --> 00:39:50,804
Apologize to your father.

692
00:39:50,873 --> 00:39:52,397
I'm not raising my voice!

693
00:39:52,475 --> 00:39:53,806
You get a job, pay your own way?

694
00:39:53,876 --> 00:39:54,843
You're a man now?

695
00:39:54,911 --> 00:39:55,969
I'm not raising my voice!

696
00:39:56,046 --> 00:39:57,104
Just apologize!

697
00:39:57,181 --> 00:39:58,148
I didn't say anything!

698
00:39:58,216 --> 00:39:59,581
Why should I apologize?

699
00:39:59,651 --> 00:40:01,949
Like you apologized to that pig farmer?

700
00:40:02,087 --> 00:40:03,816
What did you say, boy?

701
00:40:10,695 --> 00:40:12,356
You go to your room.

702
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,163
Okay, Junior...

703
00:40:28,213 --> 00:40:30,681
I'm not going to be weak on this, Pearl.

704
00:40:31,884 --> 00:40:33,215
I know.

705
00:40:34,687 --> 00:40:38,350
I can't allow my son to be corrupted.

706
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:39,891
You're right.

707
00:40:41,361 --> 00:40:43,829
Let's just go to bed.

708
00:40:43,897 --> 00:40:45,728
I'll take him to school in the morning.

709
00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:47,266
All right?

710
00:40:48,435 --> 00:40:49,663
All right.

711
00:41:02,449 --> 00:41:04,314
I'm going to be honest with you, boys.

712
00:41:04,351 --> 00:41:05,716
I'm not well.

713
00:41:05,752 --> 00:41:08,346
I'm not well at all this morning.

714
00:41:08,421 --> 00:41:09,888
I'm sure sorry to hear that, sir.

715
00:41:09,956 --> 00:41:10,945
You look well to me.

716
00:41:11,024 --> 00:41:12,150
Don't he look well, Sam?

717
00:41:12,259 --> 00:41:14,227
Yes, sir. He looks real good.

718
00:41:14,294 --> 00:41:18,731
Now, we got some white fellas
from up north come into our town.

719
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:21,768
They're stirring up trouble
between our coloreds and our whites.

720
00:41:21,836 --> 00:41:23,701
They say that we need to make a union:

721
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:26,297
The sharecroppers
and the workers all together,

722
00:41:26,376 --> 00:41:27,570
colored and white.

723
00:41:27,644 --> 00:41:29,475
They need to make a union?

724
00:41:29,546 --> 00:41:31,480
How do you boys feel about that?

725
00:41:31,548 --> 00:41:32,810
I don't know, sir.

726
00:41:32,882 --> 00:41:34,873
I really ain't thought much about that.

727
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:36,919
Well, it's a bad idea.

728
00:41:36,986 --> 00:41:39,477
It's a bad idea, take my word for it.

729
00:41:39,556 --> 00:41:41,456
Yes, sir.

730
00:41:41,524 --> 00:41:44,084
And they say that there was
some kind of secret meeting

731
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,525
last night down near the lake.

732
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,152
Now, do you boys know about that?

733
00:41:47,263 --> 00:41:48,662
No, sir.

734
00:41:48,731 --> 00:41:50,858
You don't know about that?

735
00:41:51,935 --> 00:41:53,596
- Samuel?
- No, sir.

736
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:55,001
- You didn't hear about that?
- No, sir.

737
00:41:55,072 --> 00:41:56,369
- You swear to me?
- Yes, sir.

738
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,964
Yes, sir, I swear.

739
00:42:00,811 --> 00:42:02,574
All right, then.

740
00:42:05,082 --> 00:42:06,572
See you later.

741
00:42:06,784 --> 00:42:09,412
Our first debate

742
00:42:09,453 --> 00:42:14,413
is one week from today.

743
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:16,356
- One week?
- That's right.

744
00:42:16,428 --> 00:42:18,089
I thought Prairie View was first.

745
00:42:18,196 --> 00:42:21,029
Prairie View is tough,
so I thought we needed a warm-up.

746
00:42:21,099 --> 00:42:23,590
With the best Negro college in the state?

747
00:42:23,702 --> 00:42:25,431
That's right, Mr. Burgess.

748
00:42:25,503 --> 00:42:26,595
Does that frighten you?

749
00:42:26,705 --> 00:42:28,229
Yes, sir.

750
00:42:28,306 --> 00:42:31,400
One week's not enough time
to write our arguments.

751
00:42:31,476 --> 00:42:33,535
You do the research.
I'll write the arguments.

752
00:42:33,612 --> 00:42:35,477
Wait. You...

753
00:42:35,548 --> 00:42:36,981
You write the arguments?

754
00:42:37,049 --> 00:42:38,038
And you deliver them, Mr. Lowe.

755
00:42:38,117 --> 00:42:39,846
What the hell do I look like, a mailman?

756
00:42:39,919 --> 00:42:42,888
Hell is where you're headed
if you question me again.

757
00:42:42,955 --> 00:42:45,583
In theory, you look like a student.

758
00:42:45,658 --> 00:42:47,956
So what you're saying
is I'm not capable.

759
00:42:48,027 --> 00:42:49,187
It's not a matter of competence.

760
00:42:49,262 --> 00:42:50,320
It's a matter of experience.

761
00:42:50,396 --> 00:42:51,556
How do I know you write...

762
00:42:51,665 --> 00:42:53,360
I write the arguments!

763
00:42:53,467 --> 00:42:54,729
That's the way it's been!

764
00:42:54,835 --> 00:42:57,201
That's the way it's going to be!

765
00:42:57,271 --> 00:42:59,967
Any more questions?

766
00:43:01,608 --> 00:43:03,166
One week.

767
00:43:05,646 --> 00:43:06,772
[Moderator]
I bring to you

768
00:43:06,847 --> 00:43:09,042
our first affirmative debater:

769
00:43:09,117 --> 00:43:13,281
From Paul quinn College,
Otheree Hubbard.

770
00:43:21,096 --> 00:43:25,499
Resolved: Unemployment
relief should be ended

771
00:43:25,601 --> 00:43:28,069
when the Depression ends.

772
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,967
If the Depression ends.

773
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:33,668
I traveled back through history to 1536,

774
00:43:33,742 --> 00:43:36,233
when the first Poor Laws
of England were mandated.

775
00:43:36,312 --> 00:43:39,645
In those days, the dole...
or welfare, as we call it...

776
00:43:39,715 --> 00:43:42,445
was funded by voluntary contributions.

777
00:43:42,518 --> 00:43:44,986
But, as time passed,

778
00:43:45,054 --> 00:43:47,215
the English devised the Allowance System,

779
00:43:47,289 --> 00:43:49,257
the first unemployment relief,

780
00:43:49,325 --> 00:43:52,658
only now it was paid
with involuntary contributions,

781
00:43:52,728 --> 00:43:54,628
more commonly known as taxes.

782
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:55,892
[Audience laughs]

783
00:43:55,965 --> 00:43:58,297
The Allowance System was a disaster.

784
00:43:58,401 --> 00:44:01,268
The only real unemployment relief
is to give a man a job.

785
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:04,340
But to do that, you have
to give the economy life,

786
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:07,606
not tax it to death.

787
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,545
When capitalism was young,

788
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:16,711
the old puritanical concept of duty

789
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:20,154
was, "He who does not work
shall not eat."

790
00:44:20,225 --> 00:44:22,090
That made sense
when there was more work

791
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,855
than men willing to do it.

792
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:25,487
But those days are gone.

793
00:44:25,564 --> 00:44:27,429
Now there are millions
who want to work,

794
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:29,364
but find themselves
standing in breadlines.

795
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:32,096
Now, should they not eat
because there are no jobs?

796
00:44:32,204 --> 00:44:34,365
People, today we need
a new concept of duty:

797
00:44:34,474 --> 00:44:37,443
The right of the individual
to demand from society

798
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:40,445
just as much as he gives to society.

799
00:44:43,216 --> 00:44:46,083
We clutch at anything that
even looks like a solution.

800
00:44:46,152 --> 00:44:49,451
$60 million a month for public relief?

801
00:44:49,522 --> 00:44:53,322
Pay it out if it'll sweep
the hoboes off the streets.

802
00:44:53,394 --> 00:44:57,854
One seventh of the population
of the United States on welfare.

803
00:44:57,931 --> 00:45:00,263
Fine, as long as it ends our misery.

804
00:45:00,334 --> 00:45:04,737
A nation as desperate as this
is a danger to itself.

805
00:45:04,805 --> 00:45:06,796
- [Applause]
- [Audience member] That's right.

806
00:45:09,143 --> 00:45:10,610
Once,

807
00:45:10,711 --> 00:45:14,647
a Roman general brought peace
to a rebellious province...

808
00:45:14,749 --> 00:45:17,547
by killing all its citizens.

809
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:19,280
Even his fellow Romans
were shocked.

810
00:45:19,354 --> 00:45:20,582
One of them wrote,

811
00:45:20,655 --> 00:45:22,953
"Solitudinem faciunt,
pacem appellant,"

812
00:45:23,024 --> 00:45:27,256
which means "They create desolation
and call it peace."

813
00:45:28,363 --> 00:45:30,160
Now, for all their facts and figures,

814
00:45:30,231 --> 00:45:34,065
the Paul quinn debaters would also
create desolation and call it peace.

815
00:45:34,135 --> 00:45:38,231
They would allow the unemployed to die
so the economy can live.

816
00:45:38,339 --> 00:45:39,897
[Applause]

817
00:45:56,093 --> 00:45:57,720
A brilliant young woman I know

818
00:45:57,795 --> 00:46:01,731
was asked once to support her argument
in favor of social welfare.

819
00:46:01,866 --> 00:46:05,165
She named the most powerful source
imaginable:

820
00:46:05,203 --> 00:46:09,435
The look in a mother's face
when she cannot feed her children.

821
00:46:13,377 --> 00:46:15,777
Can you look that hungry
child in the eyes?

822
00:46:15,847 --> 00:46:17,212
See the blood on his feet

823
00:46:17,281 --> 00:46:19,249
from walking barefoot
in the cotton fields?

824
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:22,376
Or do you ask his baby sister
with her belly swollen from hunger

825
00:46:22,453 --> 00:46:24,318
if she cares about
her daddy's work ethic?

826
00:46:24,388 --> 00:46:25,685
[Applause]

827
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:35,655
He's good.

828
00:46:37,369 --> 00:46:40,702
Wiley! Wiley! Wiley! Wiley!

829
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:44,141
Wiley! Wiley! Wiley! Wiley!

830
00:46:44,244 --> 00:46:47,042
Wiley! Wiley! Wiley!

831
00:46:47,146 --> 00:46:48,408
# Had a little girl #

832
00:46:48,515 --> 00:46:49,641
# She's little and low #

833
00:46:49,749 --> 00:46:51,114
# She used to love me #

834
00:46:51,184 --> 00:46:52,412
# But she don't no more #

835
00:46:52,485 --> 00:46:55,181
# You got to step it up and go, yeah #

836
00:46:55,255 --> 00:46:56,244
# Yeah, and go #

837
00:46:56,322 --> 00:46:58,813
The only thing that matters
is that big fish eat little fish,

838
00:46:58,892 --> 00:47:01,019
and the color of the fish
does not count!

839
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,684
#... step it up and go #

840
00:47:03,897 --> 00:47:06,764
If the state of Mississippi
would have turned their heads

841
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:09,199
each and every time
a Negro was lynched,

842
00:47:09,269 --> 00:47:10,896
shouldn't the federal government intervene?

843
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,770
# Yeah, and go #

844
00:47:14,843 --> 00:47:16,276
# Well, you can't stand pat #

845
00:47:16,344 --> 00:47:19,040
# I declare you got
to step it up and go #

846
00:47:20,582 --> 00:47:23,517
# Front door shut, back door, too #

847
00:47:23,585 --> 00:47:25,382
# Blinds pulled down, whatcha gonna do? #

848
00:47:25,453 --> 00:47:28,320
Wiley! Wiley! Wiley! Wiley!

849
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:31,154
Wiley! Wiley! Wiley! Wiley!

850
00:47:31,227 --> 00:47:32,785
# Well, you can't stand pat #

# I declare you got to step it up and go #

852
00:47:38,134 --> 00:47:39,226
# Got a little girl #

853
00:47:39,302 --> 00:47:40,792
# Her name is Ball #

854
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:42,997
# Gave a little bit, but she took it all #

855
00:47:43,072 --> 00:47:45,563
# You got to step it up and go now #

856
00:47:45,641 --> 00:47:47,632
# Yeah, go #

857
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:49,905
[Moderator]
And the winner is...

858
00:47:49,979 --> 00:47:53,346
# I declare you got
to step it up and go now #

859
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:54,917
Wiley College!

860
00:47:55,018 --> 00:47:57,612
# Me and my baby
walkin' down the street #

# Tellin' everybody
'bout the chief of police #

00:48:00,257 --> 00:48:02,521
# You got to step it up and go now #

863
00:48:02,659 --> 00:48:05,594
# Yeah, and go #

00:48:05,629 --> 00:48:07,187
# Well, you can't stand pat #

# I declare you got

00:48:11,702 --> 00:48:14,569
# If you see my woman,

Wiley! Wiley! Wiley! Wiley! Wiley!

870
00:48:22,613 --> 00:48:24,012
# Well, you can't stand pat #

871
00:48:24,082 --> 00:48:26,915
# I declare you got
to step it up and go #

872
00:48:28,186 --> 00:48:29,551
# Well, I'll sing this verse #

873
00:48:29,621 --> 00:48:31,213
# Ain't gonna sing no more #

874
00:48:31,323 --> 00:48:33,120
# Hear my gal call... #

875
00:48:33,192 --> 00:48:34,284
[Dozier]
That's right, Captain.

876
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,952
I think I've got the ringleader.

877
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:41,392
Uh, all right,
if that's what you want.

878
00:48:42,402 --> 00:48:44,267
Yeah. Okey-dokey, then.

879
00:48:44,337 --> 00:48:45,736
Bye-bye.

880
00:48:47,641 --> 00:48:48,801
Shit.

881
00:48:48,875 --> 00:48:50,342
[Deputy]
Who was that?

882
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:51,877
Captain Wainwright.

883
00:48:51,945 --> 00:48:53,708
Texas Rangers?

884
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:54,974
Mm-hmm.

885
00:48:56,449 --> 00:49:00,351
He wants me to, uh, hold off
on picking this fella up

886
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,513
until him and his boys get up here.

887
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:04,919
Shit. Wants to get
his picture in the paper.

888
00:49:04,958 --> 00:49:05,982
Yeah.

889
00:49:06,059 --> 00:49:09,153
We do all the work,
they get all the glory.

890
00:49:09,229 --> 00:49:10,753
Yep.

891
00:49:10,831 --> 00:49:12,230
[Sigh]

892
00:49:12,299 --> 00:49:16,971
I guess that's just the way the world is.

893
00:49:16,972 --> 00:49:18,837
Isn't that right, Samuel?

894
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:27,271
I have an announcement
to make. Excuse me.

895
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:30,918
Recently, l... uh, we...

896
00:49:31,019 --> 00:49:32,486
Mm-hmm.

897
00:49:32,554 --> 00:49:35,990
...sent some letters
to some major universities.

898
00:49:36,058 --> 00:49:38,083
Told them all about us, our team,

899
00:49:38,193 --> 00:49:39,626
what we've been doing,

900
00:49:39,695 --> 00:49:43,654
and, uh, yesterday
we got a response.

901
00:49:44,866 --> 00:49:47,061
From Oklahoma City University.

902
00:49:47,135 --> 00:49:48,568
Aren't they...?

903
00:49:48,637 --> 00:49:50,502
Anglo-Saxon? Yes. Yes.

904
00:49:50,573 --> 00:49:52,404
We'll be the first Negro college in America...

905
00:49:52,475 --> 00:49:54,670
well, one of the first Negro
colleges in America...

906
00:49:54,744 --> 00:49:56,211
to ever debate a white college.

907
00:49:56,279 --> 00:49:57,371
All right!

908
00:49:57,447 --> 00:49:59,074
University of Oklahoma!

909
00:49:59,148 --> 00:50:02,515
Not University of Oklahoma.
Oklahoma City University.

910
00:50:02,652 --> 00:50:05,382
The debate will take place
at an off-campus site.

911
00:50:05,422 --> 00:50:07,083
Wait. An off-campus site? Why?

912
00:50:07,191 --> 00:50:09,216
Because sometimes, Mr. Lowe,

913
00:50:09,327 --> 00:50:11,591
you have to take things
one step at a time.

914
00:50:11,663 --> 00:50:13,460
So what you're saying is
the crackers in Oklahoma

915
00:50:13,531 --> 00:50:14,930
ain't gonna let us on their campus.

916
00:50:14,999 --> 00:50:18,059
No, what I'm saying is you have to take
things one step at a time.

917
00:50:18,136 --> 00:50:19,603
This is a great opportunity.

918
00:50:19,671 --> 00:50:20,603
Thank you very much.

919
00:50:20,672 --> 00:50:24,164
Master is going to give us
a crumb off his plate, huh?

920
00:50:27,345 --> 00:50:29,210
What? Wha...

921
00:50:29,281 --> 00:50:31,977
I think Lowe here is afraid.

922
00:50:32,051 --> 00:50:34,519
What am I afraid of, James?

923
00:50:34,587 --> 00:50:36,555
I think you're afraid
to debate white people.

924
00:50:36,622 --> 00:50:37,987
- Anglo-Saxons.
- Anglo-Saxons.

925
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:38,818
Thank you very much.

926
00:50:38,924 --> 00:50:40,448
Mr. Tolson, let me debate.

927
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:45,189
I mean, I'll debate
Anglo-Saxons anywhere:

928
00:50:45,297 --> 00:50:47,094
In a dark alley, with no light,

929
00:50:47,166 --> 00:50:49,430
with a candle lit and people
chasing you down with guns.

930
00:50:49,502 --> 00:50:51,800
Hell, I'll debate Anglo-Saxons anywhere.

931
00:50:51,871 --> 00:50:53,133
I ain't afraid.

932
00:50:53,205 --> 00:50:54,763
I am.

933
00:50:57,109 --> 00:50:58,269
[Sigh]

934
00:50:58,344 --> 00:51:00,574
Mr. Tolson, when I came here today,

935
00:51:00,646 --> 00:51:03,809
I saw the sheriff outside watching your house.

936
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:05,943
What's going on?

937
00:51:10,291 --> 00:51:12,282
Maybe you should ask the sheriff.

938
00:51:12,393 --> 00:51:15,123
I've been hearing a lot of rumors
about what you're doing.

939
00:51:15,229 --> 00:51:17,129
My dad just called the Dean last week

940
00:51:17,198 --> 00:51:18,756
and asked, "What is
a communist doing

941
00:51:18,866 --> 00:51:20,231
teaching at a good Methodist college?"

942
00:51:20,301 --> 00:51:22,394
My politics are my business,
Mr. Burgess,

943
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:25,200
and I promise you that they
will not endanger the team.

944
00:51:25,273 --> 00:51:26,900
But, sir, it is being endangered.

945
00:51:26,974 --> 00:51:29,306
I came to Wiley College
to be educated, not investigated.

946
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:30,503
I understand that.

947
00:51:30,578 --> 00:51:32,478
I don't want to be dragged into anything.

948
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:34,675
- You're not...
- If my parents find...

949
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:36,547
I'm sorry.

950
00:51:37,686 --> 00:51:40,120
Mr. Tolson, please.

951
00:51:40,189 --> 00:51:42,282
Just tell me you're not
a communist. Otherwise...

952
00:51:42,357 --> 00:51:44,052
Otherwise what?

953
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:48,954
Otherwise what?

954
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:50,896
My father says I have to quit.

955
00:51:50,967 --> 00:51:52,298
Nobody wants that.

956
00:51:52,368 --> 00:51:53,699
Then tell me.

957
00:51:55,372 --> 00:52:01,072
As I said, my politics are my business.

958
00:52:02,813 --> 00:52:04,644
I guess I have to resign.

959
00:52:14,491 --> 00:52:19,292
Mrs. Tolson, thank you
for a wonderful dinner.

960
00:52:19,396 --> 00:52:21,591
You're welcome, Ham.

961
00:52:23,534 --> 00:52:25,126
Good luck in Oklahoma, y'all.

962
00:52:28,106 --> 00:52:29,801
I know you'll win.

963
00:52:44,723 --> 00:52:46,452
All right. Well,

964
00:52:46,525 --> 00:52:49,392
if anybody else wants to quit, I'll understand.

965
00:53:35,376 --> 00:53:36,502
Resolved:

966
00:53:36,577 --> 00:53:40,104
Negroes should be...

967
00:53:40,182 --> 00:53:42,776
should be admitted...

968
00:53:42,851 --> 00:53:44,318
I can't hear you!

969
00:53:44,386 --> 00:53:46,047
Speak up!

970
00:53:46,121 --> 00:53:48,214
[Iouder]
Resolved...

971
00:53:49,592 --> 00:53:56,896
Negroes should be admitted
to state universities.

972
00:53:56,967 --> 00:54:00,164
My partner and I will prove

973
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:04,639
that blocking a Negro's admission
to a state university

974
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:09,407
is not only wrong, it is absurd.

975
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:16,146
The Negro people are not just a color
in the American fabric.

976
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:19,188
They are the thread
that holds it all together.

977
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:23,021
Consider the legal
and historical record.

978
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,061
May 13, 1865:

979
00:54:25,129 --> 00:54:26,756
Sergeant Crocker, a Negro,

980
00:54:26,832 --> 00:54:30,598
is the last soldier to die in the Civil War.

981
00:54:30,669 --> 00:54:32,830
1918: The first U.S. Soldiers

982
00:54:32,939 --> 00:54:34,804
decorated for bravery in France

983
00:54:34,874 --> 00:54:38,366
are Negroes Henry Johnson
and Needham Roberts.

984
00:54:38,478 --> 00:54:41,914
1920: The New York Times announces

985
00:54:41,981 --> 00:54:46,111
that the "N" in Negro would hereafter
be capitalized.

986
00:54:46,185 --> 00:54:50,212
To force upon the South
what they are not ready for

987
00:54:50,289 --> 00:54:52,621
would result in nothing
but more racial hatred.

988
00:54:52,692 --> 00:54:53,681
[Audience member]
What?

989
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,785
Dr. W.E.B. DuBois...

990
00:54:55,862 --> 00:54:59,059
he's perhaps the most eminent
Negro scholar in America.

991
00:54:59,132 --> 00:55:00,997
He comments...

992
00:55:01,134 --> 00:55:05,127
"It's a silly waste
of money, time, and temper

993
00:55:05,171 --> 00:55:06,798
"to try and compel a powerful majority

994
00:55:06,874 --> 00:55:10,833
to do what they are
determined not to do."

995
00:55:10,944 --> 00:55:14,311
My opponent so conveniently chose
to ignore the fact

996
00:55:14,381 --> 00:55:18,044
that W.E.B. DuBois is the first Negro

997
00:55:18,118 --> 00:55:21,781
to receive a Ph. D
from a white college called Harvard.

998
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,413
Dr. DuBois, he adds,

999
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:27,859
"It is impossible...
impossible for a Negro

1000
00:55:27,929 --> 00:55:30,762
to receive a proper education
at a white college."

1001
00:55:30,832 --> 00:55:33,858
The most eminent
Negro scholar in America

1002
00:55:33,935 --> 00:55:36,267
is the product of
an Ivy League education.

1003
00:55:36,337 --> 00:55:39,602
You see, DuBois knows all too well
the white man's resistance to change.

1004
00:55:39,707 --> 00:55:43,507
But that's no reason to keep
a black man out of any college.

1005
00:55:43,578 --> 00:55:46,775
If someone didn't force upon the South
something it wasn't ready for,

1006
00:55:46,849 --> 00:55:48,043
I'd still be in chains,

1007
00:55:48,117 --> 00:55:50,551
and Miss Booke here would be
running from her old Master!

1008
00:55:50,619 --> 00:55:52,314
[Applause]

1009
00:55:52,389 --> 00:55:55,017
I do admit it.

1010
00:55:55,092 --> 00:55:56,992
It is true.

1011
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:01,190
Far too many whites are afflicted
with the disease of racial hatred.

1012
00:56:01,331 --> 00:56:03,458
And because of racism,

1013
00:56:03,533 --> 00:56:06,093
it would be impossible
for a Negro to be happy

1014
00:56:06,136 --> 00:56:07,501
at a southern white college today.

1015
00:56:07,537 --> 00:56:08,629
[Woman]
That's true.

1016
00:56:08,705 --> 00:56:10,070
And if someone is unhappy,

1017
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:14,236
it is impossible to see how they could
receive a proper education.

1018
00:56:14,344 --> 00:56:15,811
That's right.

1019
00:56:15,879 --> 00:56:17,437
Yes, a time will come

1020
00:56:17,548 --> 00:56:20,415
when Negroes and whites
will walk on the same campus

1021
00:56:20,485 --> 00:56:23,147
and we will share
the same classrooms.

1022
00:56:24,689 --> 00:56:27,920
But sadly, that day is not today.

1023
00:56:27,993 --> 00:56:31,485
As long as schools
are segregated,

1024
00:56:31,563 --> 00:56:37,365
Negroes will receive an education
that is both separate and unequal.

1025
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:39,404
By Oklahoma's own reckoning,

1026
00:56:39,471 --> 00:56:43,202
the state is currently
spending five times more

1027
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:45,243
for the education of a white child

1028
00:56:45,344 --> 00:56:47,676
than it is spending
to educate a colored child.

1029
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:51,374
That means better textbooks
for that child than for that child.

1030
00:56:51,483 --> 00:56:53,041
Oh, I say that's a shame,

1031
00:56:53,152 --> 00:56:56,246
but my opponent says
today is not the day

1032
00:56:56,321 --> 00:57:00,121
for whites and coloreds
to go to the same college,

1033
00:57:00,192 --> 00:57:02,456
to share the same campus,

1034
00:57:02,594 --> 00:57:04,585
to walk in the same classroom.

1035
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:08,259
Well, would you kindly tell me
when is that day gonna come?

1036
00:57:08,301 --> 00:57:10,565
Is it gonna come tomorrow?
Is it gonna come next week?

1037
00:57:10,638 --> 00:57:11,935
In a hundred years?

1038
00:57:12,006 --> 00:57:13,064
Never?

1039
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:15,131
No, the time for justice,

1040
00:57:15,209 --> 00:57:18,178
the time for freedom,
and the time for equality

1041
00:57:18,246 --> 00:57:22,012
is always, is always, right now!

1042
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,489
Thank you.

1043
00:57:49,812 --> 00:57:51,541
[Coughing]

1044
00:57:51,614 --> 00:57:53,047
What is this?

1045
00:57:53,149 --> 00:57:54,616
I told you it was holy wine.

1046
00:57:54,717 --> 00:57:55,877
Put hair on your chest.

1047
00:57:55,985 --> 00:57:57,418
If you say so.

1048
00:57:57,486 --> 00:57:58,418
Good, ain't it?

1049
00:57:58,487 --> 00:57:59,579
[Cough]
Uh-huh.

1050
00:57:59,689 --> 00:58:01,816
You know where the bathroom
is if you need it.

1051
00:58:01,958 --> 00:58:03,186
Yeah.
[Cough]

1052
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:05,228
[General chatter]

1053
00:58:08,498 --> 00:58:10,864
And my weapons were words.

1054
00:58:10,934 --> 00:58:13,266
I didn't need a gun. I didn't need a knife.

1055
00:58:13,337 --> 00:58:14,326
You see...

1056
00:58:15,806 --> 00:58:17,933
Meet me outside in five minutes.

1057
00:58:18,008 --> 00:58:20,067
And then what?

1058
00:58:31,856 --> 00:58:33,221
Yes, I did, honey,

1059
00:58:33,291 --> 00:58:35,657
and nobody knows that
better than you know.

1060
00:58:35,727 --> 00:58:36,853
Oh, I'm fine.

1061
00:58:36,928 --> 00:58:38,361
How are you doing, Pearl?

1062
00:58:38,429 --> 00:58:39,453
Pearl!

1063
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:41,395
Yes, I do. Where's your husband?

1064
00:58:41,466 --> 00:58:43,297
- He's in the study.
- Okay.

1065
00:58:56,883 --> 00:58:58,783
Dr. Farmer.

1066
00:58:58,885 --> 00:59:00,182
Congratulations, Melvin.

1067
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:01,185
Thank you.

1068
00:59:01,321 --> 00:59:02,652
You've put us on the map.

1069
00:59:02,722 --> 00:59:04,349
Well, your son is doing a great job.

1070
00:59:04,392 --> 00:59:05,791
His research is impeccable.

1071
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:08,488
That's good to hear.
That's good to hear.

1072
00:59:08,562 --> 00:59:11,429
Listen, there are people around town

1073
00:59:11,499 --> 00:59:14,400
who aren't very happy
with your off-campus activities.

1074
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:17,633
They're calling you a radical.

1075
00:59:17,705 --> 00:59:19,764
In fact, I wouldn't be a bit surprised

1076
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,001
to find out one morning
when I woke up

1077
00:59:22,076 --> 00:59:23,941
that you were strung up to a tree.

1078
00:59:24,011 --> 00:59:25,376
They'd have to catch me first.

1079
00:59:25,446 --> 00:59:26,970
This is serious, Melvin.

1080
00:59:27,048 --> 00:59:28,709
Very serious.

1081
00:59:28,783 --> 00:59:31,343
A hungry Negro steals
a chicken, he goes to jail.

1082
00:59:31,419 --> 00:59:34,252
A rich businessman steals
bonds, he goes to Congress.

1083
00:59:34,355 --> 00:59:35,549
I think that's wrong.

1084
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:38,853
Now, if that makes me a radical,
a socialist, a communist, so be it.

1085
00:59:38,926 --> 00:59:39,984
Amen... Amen on that.

1086
00:59:40,094 --> 00:59:41,618
- Jesus was a radical.
- Careful.

1087
00:59:41,729 --> 00:59:43,594
Yes, He was. Jesus was a radical.

1088
00:59:43,665 --> 00:59:45,189
Mental institutions are filled with people

1089
00:59:45,267 --> 00:59:46,859
who have confused themselves
with Jesus Christ.

1090
00:59:46,935 --> 00:59:47,993
I'm not confused.

1091
00:59:48,071 --> 00:59:49,538
You're convinced you're Jesus Christ now?

1092
00:59:49,605 --> 00:59:51,038
- No.
- You're convinced you're Jesus Christ?

1093
00:59:51,107 --> 00:59:52,438
You know what words do.

1094
00:59:52,508 --> 00:59:53,668
- Okay.
- Come on now.

1095
00:59:53,743 --> 00:59:54,971
Amen.

1096
00:59:55,044 --> 00:59:56,341
Don't want to confuse
yourself with Jesus Christ.

1097
00:59:56,412 --> 00:59:58,243
I'm not confused. I'm convinced.

1098
00:59:58,314 --> 01:00:00,942
I'm not, uh, I'm not judging you.

1099
01:00:02,151 --> 01:00:06,789
I'm just concerned
about your methods.

1100
01:00:06,789 --> 01:00:08,757
What methods?

1101
01:00:08,825 --> 01:00:11,885
James was there that night, wasn't he?

1102
01:00:11,995 --> 01:00:14,623
He was not with me.

1103
01:00:14,698 --> 01:00:15,926
Is he involved in this?

1104
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,261
Of course not, James.

1105
01:00:17,334 --> 01:00:20,098
I've done everything in my power
to keep him out of this.

1106
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:21,228
- To keep him out?
- Yes.

1107
01:00:21,305 --> 01:00:23,068
Are you telling me
he wants to be involved?

1108
01:00:23,141 --> 01:00:24,768
Maybe this is something
you should discuss with him.

1109
01:00:24,843 --> 01:00:26,242
I'm discussing it with you right now,

1110
01:00:26,311 --> 01:00:28,370
and I don't feel like I'm getting
a straight answer.

1111
01:00:28,446 --> 01:00:29,606
You're getting a straight answer.

1112
01:00:29,681 --> 01:00:32,149
I think that you were
there with him that night.

1113
01:00:32,217 --> 01:00:33,149
He was not with me.

1114
01:00:33,218 --> 01:00:34,310
He's a 14-year-old boy.

1115
01:00:34,386 --> 01:00:35,375
I understand that.

1116
01:00:35,453 --> 01:00:38,013
I'll do whatever I have to do
to protect him.

1117
01:00:38,089 --> 01:00:39,249
Is anybody thirsty?

1118
01:00:39,357 --> 01:00:40,847
Here you are.

1119
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,894
Thank you. Thank you, Ruth.

1120
01:00:42,962 --> 01:00:44,361
- You're welcome.
- Mm-hmm.

1121
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:45,897
Okay.

1122
01:00:45,998 --> 01:00:48,364
Ruth, this is a fine party.

1123
01:00:48,434 --> 01:00:49,833
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

1124
01:00:49,902 --> 01:00:51,870
I think it's time
for some sweet potato pie.

1125
01:00:51,937 --> 01:00:52,869
Please.

1126
01:00:52,938 --> 01:00:54,269
I'll help you with that.

1127
01:01:01,313 --> 01:01:03,941
Not the time to talk about it.

1128
01:01:04,017 --> 01:01:04,779
Congratulations.

1129
01:01:04,818 --> 01:01:06,183
Thank you.

1130
01:01:29,985 --> 01:01:32,647
It's so beautiful out here.

1131
01:01:32,721 --> 01:01:34,484
Mm-hmm.

1132
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:35,717
Yeah.

1133
01:01:35,791 --> 01:01:39,522
I was born near here,
a little further up the lake near Jefferson.

1134
01:01:39,596 --> 01:01:43,088
I've been coming here
since I was a little boy.

1135
01:01:43,167 --> 01:01:45,692
Your parents still live around here?

1136
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:48,898
No, no. They're, uh, they're gone.

1137
01:01:49,007 --> 01:01:50,998
My grandparents raised me.

1138
01:01:51,109 --> 01:01:53,077
And my Pah-Pah, he, uh,

1139
01:01:53,177 --> 01:01:55,475
spent his life doing
the levees around here...

1140
01:01:55,546 --> 01:01:56,808
for free, of course.

1141
01:01:56,881 --> 01:01:59,111
- Mm. He was a slave?
- Mm-hmm.

1142
01:01:59,183 --> 01:02:01,617
My grandma was always
telling me to be good

1143
01:02:01,753 --> 01:02:05,189
or else the Confederates would rise up
out of Marshall Cemetery and get me.

1144
01:02:07,725 --> 01:02:09,090
Boy.

1145
01:02:13,364 --> 01:02:14,524
What?

1146
01:02:14,599 --> 01:02:17,864
I've just never seen
this side of you before.

1147
01:02:17,935 --> 01:02:20,028
What side?

1148
01:02:20,138 --> 01:02:22,572
You seem so calm,

1149
01:02:22,641 --> 01:02:24,074
so peaceful.

1150
01:02:24,143 --> 01:02:27,442
It's what the lake does to me.

1151
01:02:27,514 --> 01:02:29,982
I'm happy when I'm out here,
you know?

1152
01:02:31,918 --> 01:02:33,579
It's funny.

1153
01:02:47,367 --> 01:02:52,066
Part of me wants to just stay out here
by the lake, you know?

1154
01:02:52,138 --> 01:02:57,235
Read books all day and hunt
and fish when I get hungry.

1155
01:02:57,343 --> 01:02:59,641
And the other part
wants to go everywhere,

1156
01:02:59,713 --> 01:03:00,975
you know, see everything.

1157
01:03:01,114 --> 01:03:07,849
I want to go to New Orleans and New York
and Chicago and even San Francisco.

1158
01:03:08,824 --> 01:03:11,349
I just want to go...

1159
01:03:11,426 --> 01:03:15,556
walking down the road and...

1160
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:16,995
just disappear.

1161
01:03:20,536 --> 01:03:23,505
Well, maybe you could
take me with you.

1164
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:12,878
It's the school band,

I thought you said nobody

1173
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,558
What's going on?

1174
01:05:26,635 --> 01:05:28,830
We're gonna go get
Mr. Tolson and Samantha,

1175
01:05:28,904 --> 01:05:31,566
head back to the campus,
and have a pep rally.

1176
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:32,971
Come on, get dressed.

1177
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:34,633
You know what?
You go get Tolson,

1178
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:36,803
and I'll meet up with y'all later on campus.

1179
01:05:36,879 --> 01:05:38,073
Come on, Lowe.

1180
01:05:38,146 --> 01:05:40,410
You know it's going to be fun.

1181
01:05:52,095 --> 01:05:54,529
I guess I'll tell them
you're going to join us later?

1182
01:06:07,545 --> 01:06:09,274
He's going to join us later.

1183
01:06:09,347 --> 01:06:12,077
He just has to clean
his house, that's all.

1184
01:06:14,386 --> 01:06:15,353
[Sigh]

1185
01:06:30,436 --> 01:06:34,270
Great news. Great news.
Great news!

1186
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:37,207
My phone has been ringing off the hook.

1187
01:06:37,276 --> 01:06:39,471
University of Michigan
wants to debate us.

1188
01:06:39,545 --> 01:06:41,570
So does SMU. So does Georgia.

1189
01:06:41,647 --> 01:06:42,739
Where's Mr. Lowe?

1190
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,783
When do I get to debate?

1191
01:06:44,850 --> 01:06:46,215
Sooner than you think, James.

1192
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:47,377
Sooner than you think.

1193
01:06:47,486 --> 01:06:48,612
When?

1194
01:06:48,722 --> 01:06:50,053
When you're ready.

1195
01:06:50,123 --> 01:06:51,283
I'm ready now.

1196
01:06:51,391 --> 01:06:54,554
Mr. Tolson, I do not mind if James...

1197
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:57,656
What's wrong?

1198
01:06:57,731 --> 01:07:00,165
Maybe I'm tired of this.

1199
01:07:00,234 --> 01:07:01,565
Of what?

1200
01:07:01,703 --> 01:07:03,637
Of watching other people debate.

1201
01:07:03,705 --> 01:07:05,900
When am I going to get
a chance to prove myself?

1202
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:07,908
You're our best researcher, James.

1203
01:07:07,942 --> 01:07:09,534
We could not do this without you.

1204
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:11,908
You do plenty without me.

1205
01:07:16,751 --> 01:07:18,082
Excuse me.

1206
01:07:21,356 --> 01:07:22,516
- James!
- What?

1207
01:07:22,623 --> 01:07:25,456
James, you wait!

1208
01:07:25,527 --> 01:07:28,360
That was so mean
what you said in there.

1209
01:07:30,099 --> 01:07:32,192
All right, uh, look,

1210
01:07:32,267 --> 01:07:33,962
I don't want to lose your friendship.

1211
01:07:34,036 --> 01:07:37,096
How can you lose something
that you never had?

1212
01:07:37,172 --> 01:07:39,197
You were never my friend?

1213
01:07:39,275 --> 01:07:41,675
Maybe I don't want
to just be your friend.

1214
01:07:41,746 --> 01:07:44,214
Maybe it hurts me
to be your friend.

Where is he?

01:08:13,611 --> 01:08:14,771
Calm down, Henry.

1221
01:08:14,845 --> 01:08:15,777

No, they won't let us.

1223
01:08:17,081 --> 01:08:18,446
They didn't do nothing to you, did they?

01:08:18,517 --> 01:08:20,508
- No, we're fine.
- Deputy,

I'm Dr. James Farmer

This is William Taylor,
Mr. Tolson's attorney.

01:08:24,189 --> 01:08:25,656
And this is his wife Ruth.

01:08:25,724 --> 01:08:26,748
Hello.

1229
01:08:26,858 --> 01:08:28,382
I'd like to see my client, please.

Sheriff Dozier. Dr. James Farmer...

1232
01:08:31,129 --> 01:08:32,926
Hello, William. How you doing today?

1233
01:08:32,998 --> 01:08:34,556
Fine, sir, thank you. And you?

1234
01:08:34,667 --> 01:08:36,259
Oh, not too bad, not too bad.

1235
01:08:36,335 --> 01:08:37,859
Me and William, we go way back.

1236
01:08:37,937 --> 01:08:39,928
I knew William when I was a boy.

1237
01:08:40,006 --> 01:08:42,873
Could I see my client now, Sheriff?

1238
01:08:42,942 --> 01:08:44,136
Your client?

1239
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:46,610
Well, the fact of the business
is, William,

1240
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:48,579
your client is kind of busy right now.

1241
01:08:48,648 --> 01:08:49,910
Busy doing what?

1242
01:08:49,983 --> 01:08:52,611

That's right.

1257
01:09:20,048 --> 01:09:24,075

when you let the unions in.

People get all riled up about nothing.

1260
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:31,624
One of them's liable to get hurt,
if you catch my drift.

1261
01:09:31,694 --> 01:09:33,662
Sheriff, since it's clear

1262
01:09:33,762 --> 01:09:36,925
that you have no evidence
to arrest Mr. Tolson,

1263
01:09:37,033 --> 01:09:38,933
I suggest you let him go.

1264
01:09:39,002 --> 01:09:40,264
You suggest it?

1265
01:09:40,337 --> 01:09:41,634
Who the hell are you?

1266
01:09:42,739 --> 01:09:44,639
Couple of months ago,

1267
01:09:44,708 --> 01:09:47,836
there was a raid
on Floyd Tillman's barn.

1268
01:09:47,911 --> 01:09:51,608
It was a peaceful and lawful
gathering of sharecroppers

1269
01:09:51,681 --> 01:09:56,584
who were brutally attacked
by a gang of violent vigilantes.

1270
01:09:56,653 --> 01:10:00,487
Now, witnesses say
that you were there.

1271
01:10:00,557 --> 01:10:04,118
If you led that raid, Sheriff,

1272
01:10:04,261 --> 01:10:07,424
you're the one who broke
the law, not Tolson.

1273
01:10:08,798 --> 01:10:10,891
Are you threatening me, boy?

1274
01:10:11,001 --> 01:10:12,332
No, sir.

1275
01:10:12,402 --> 01:10:14,370
I wouldn't do that.

1276
01:10:14,471 --> 01:10:17,497
But I cannot speak
for those people outside.

1277
01:10:18,577 --> 01:10:22,570
An unjust law is no law at all.

1278
01:10:22,649 --> 01:10:24,844
What does that mean?

1279
01:10:24,918 --> 01:10:26,943
A mass slaughter

1280
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:30,615
of citizens, both white and colored,

1281
01:10:30,690 --> 01:10:32,419
by Texas Rangers?

1282
01:10:32,492 --> 01:10:36,155
Is that really what you want
as the Sheriff of this county?

1283
01:10:38,731 --> 01:10:41,598
Now, if you let Tolson go home,

1284
01:10:41,701 --> 01:10:43,532
I believe...

1285
01:10:43,603 --> 01:10:49,007
I believe that these folks outside,
they'll go home as well.

01:12:19,972 --> 01:12:21,439
Have a seat, Mr. Farmer.

1291
01:12:23,042 --> 01:12:25,033
Oh, Lord.

1292
01:12:26,345 --> 01:12:27,539
Um...

1293
01:12:30,115 --> 01:12:32,583
SMU has cancelled.

1294
01:12:32,651 --> 01:12:36,519
University of Georgia sounds
like they will follow suit.

1295
01:12:36,588 --> 01:12:37,987
Why?

1296
01:12:39,491 --> 01:12:42,187
I've been blacklisted.

1297
01:12:42,261 --> 01:12:44,252
They're talking about censuring me.

1298
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:46,662
Dean Clay and the board
have asked me

1299
01:12:46,732 --> 01:12:50,190
to stop working with
the sharecroppers, or else.

1300
01:12:50,269 --> 01:12:52,829
They say that it is not my fight.

1301
01:12:52,905 --> 01:12:56,397
So... things are bad.

1302
01:12:56,509 --> 01:12:58,477
My academic career's in jeopardy.

1303
01:12:58,579 --> 01:13:00,945
My debate team has nowhere to go.

1304
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:05,280
Anyone know who Antaeus was?

1305
01:13:05,353 --> 01:13:09,847
Sure. He was a gigantic
wrestler in Greek mythology.

1306
01:13:09,925 --> 01:13:14,259
His mother was, uh, Gaea,
the goddess of Earth,

1307
01:13:14,329 --> 01:13:16,263
and, uh, I mean, he was unbeatable

1308
01:13:16,331 --> 01:13:18,231
because anytime someone
threw him down to the Earth,

1309
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:19,289
it would make him stronger.

1310
01:13:19,368 --> 01:13:20,562
That's correct.

1311
01:13:20,635 --> 01:13:22,034
It would make him stronger.

1312
01:13:22,104 --> 01:13:25,835
Defeat would make him stronger.

1313
01:13:25,907 --> 01:13:28,000
You are my students.
I am your teacher.

1314
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:30,806
I think that's a sacred trust.

1315
01:13:30,912 --> 01:13:32,937
So what do I say to you now?

1316
01:13:33,048 --> 01:13:35,039
Quit because the Dean says so?

1317
01:13:35,151 --> 01:13:37,051
Because the sheriff says so?

1318
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,145
Because the Texas Rangers say so?

1319
01:13:39,222 --> 01:13:40,519
No.

1320
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:42,558
I am diametrically opposed to that.

1321
01:13:42,625 --> 01:13:44,991
My message to you is to never quit.

1322
01:13:45,061 --> 01:13:46,722
We are not quitting.

1323
01:13:46,796 --> 01:13:47,820
Good.

1324
01:13:47,897 --> 01:13:49,421
What do you want us to do?

1325
01:13:49,499 --> 01:13:50,488
Debate Harvard.

1326
01:13:50,567 --> 01:13:52,034
- Harvard?
- Harvard University.

1327
01:13:52,102 --> 01:13:54,366
They're the reigning
national champions.

1328
01:13:54,438 --> 01:13:57,339
If we defeat them, we defeat the best.

1329
01:13:57,408 --> 01:13:59,342
Mr. Tolson, sir, with all due respect,

1330
01:13:59,443 --> 01:14:01,172
um, Harvard ain't going to debate us,

1331
01:14:01,345 --> 01:14:02,812
not little old Wiley College
in Marshall, Texas.

1332
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,313
They know who we are, Henry.

1333
01:14:04,381 --> 01:14:06,542
I've been writing them letters,
sending them articles.

1334
01:14:06,583 --> 01:14:08,448
But how do we get a letter back?

1335
01:14:08,519 --> 01:14:09,486
By continuing to win.

1336
01:14:09,553 --> 01:14:10,679
Dr. Farmer has informed me

1337
01:14:10,754 --> 01:14:13,917
that Howard University is going to be
at Prairie View next week.

1338
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:15,515
We annihilated Fisk.

1339
01:14:15,593 --> 01:14:18,221
If we eliminate Howard,
we will have beaten

1340
01:14:18,296 --> 01:14:20,230
the two best Negro colleges in America,

1341
01:14:20,298 --> 01:14:22,630
and I can guarantee you
that I will see to it

1342
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:24,224
that Harvard does not ignore that.

1343
01:14:24,302 --> 01:14:25,667
All right?

1344
01:14:25,737 --> 01:14:26,726
Yeah.

1345

01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:38,508

[Henry]
I've been looking the whole time.

1352
01:14:39,952 --> 01:14:41,249
Prairie View, Texas. The 127.

1353
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:43,447
You show me where to look
because it's not on...

1354
01:14:43,523 --> 01:14:44,956
127 near Waxahachie.

1355
01:14:45,025 --> 01:14:46,253
It's not there.

1356
01:14:46,326 --> 01:14:48,351
It's there. You just can't find it.

1357
01:14:48,428 --> 01:14:50,191
I see 2, and I see 7.

1358
01:14:50,263 --> 01:14:53,027
Right. Now look for a 1 in front of it,
and you got it.

1359

[Henry laughs]

- Okay.

Before 128.

1362
01:14:58,272 --> 01:15:00,103
I really don't think...

1363
01:15:00,174 --> 01:15:01,106
You don't see it.

1364
01:15:01,242 --> 01:15:02,607
When did you get this map?

01:15:45,688 --> 01:15:47,246
I'm gonna cut him down.

1367

01:42:51,751 --> 01:42:53,184
You should just give up.

1780
01:42:56,856 --> 01:42:57,845
No.

1781
01:43:03,629 --> 01:43:05,563
Who's the judge?

1782
01:43:06,799 --> 01:43:08,198
What?

1783
01:43:08,234 --> 01:43:10,361
Who's the judge?

1784
01:43:12,672 --> 01:43:14,833
The judge is God.

1785
01:43:16,110 --> 01:43:17,839
And why is he God?

1786
01:43:19,546 --> 01:43:24,381
Because he decides who wins or loses,
not my opponent.

1787
01:43:24,451 --> 01:43:27,386
And who is your opponent?

1788
01:43:27,454 --> 01:43:29,979
He doesn't exist.

1789
01:43:30,091 --> 01:43:32,855
Why doesn't he exist?

1790
01:43:32,961 --> 01:43:35,452
[Both]
Because he is a mere a dissenting voice

1791
01:43:35,563 --> 01:43:37,622
to the truth that I speak.

1792
01:43:40,368 --> 01:43:41,596
That's right.

1793
01:43:41,670 --> 01:43:43,515
Speak the truth.

1794
01:43:44,856 --> 01:43:47,229
Direct from Harvard Memorial Hall

1795
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:49,166
in Cambridge, Massachusetts,

1796
01:43:49,236 --> 01:43:53,004
this is WNBC Radio,
bringing to you live

1797
01:43:53,076 --> 01:43:54,738
tonight's history-making debate

1798
01:43:54,813 --> 01:43:58,342
between little Wiley College
from Marshall, Texas,

1799
01:43:58,419 --> 01:44:00,820
and the Harvard University Debate team,

1800
01:44:00,956 --> 01:44:02,150
the first time ever

1801
01:44:02,258 --> 01:44:04,591
a Negro college has faced
the national champions.

1802
01:44:04,662 --> 01:44:05,720
Harvard's Dean of Students

1803
01:44:05,831 --> 01:44:07,697
is making his way to the podium now.

1804
01:44:07,734 --> 01:44:10,135
The crowd, as if on cue, falls silent.

1805
01:44:11,474 --> 01:44:13,409
[Dean]
On this historic occasion,

1806
01:44:13,477 --> 01:44:16,413
we welcome the distinguished team
from Wiley College,

1807
01:44:16,482 --> 01:44:19,577
our illustrious judges, you the audience,

1808
01:44:19,653 --> 01:44:23,147
and through the wonder
of radio, the nation.

1809
01:44:23,226 --> 01:44:27,494
Harvard University celebrates
its 300th anniversary this year,

1810
01:44:27,566 --> 01:44:32,198
and, in Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
its fifth President of the United States.

1811
01:44:32,274 --> 01:44:36,212
But no university, no matter how grand
or august in its history,

1812
01:44:36,314 --> 01:44:38,840
can afford to live in the past.

1813
01:44:38,952 --> 01:44:42,720
So, in the spirit of tomorrow,

1814
01:44:42,793 --> 01:44:45,729
I introduce to you today:

1815
01:44:46,965 --> 01:44:48,934
The debaters from Wiley College:

1816
01:44:49,002 --> 01:44:50,367
Miss Samantha Booke,

1817
01:44:50,437 --> 01:44:52,429
Mr. James Farmer, Junior.

1818
01:44:52,508 --> 01:44:53,770
[Applause]

1819
01:44:53,844 --> 01:44:55,368
What?

1820
01:45:04,195 --> 01:45:07,598
Mr. Farmer will argue the first affirmative.

1821
01:45:26,832 --> 01:45:29,097
Resolved:

1822
01:45:29,170 --> 01:45:32,630
Civil disobedience is a moral weapon

1823
01:45:32,709 --> 01:45:35,645
in the fight for justice.

1824
01:45:35,714 --> 01:45:38,843
But how can disobedience
ever be moral?

1825
01:45:38,919 --> 01:45:40,284
Well, I guess that depends

1826
01:45:40,355 --> 01:45:43,189
on one's definition of the words.

1827
01:45:43,293 --> 01:45:44,282
Word.

1828
01:45:46,298 --> 01:45:49,166
In 1919, in India,

1829
01:45:49,236 --> 01:45:53,902
10,000 people gathered in Amritsar
to protest the tyranny of British rule.

1830
01:45:53,978 --> 01:45:55,036
Has it started?

1831
01:45:55,113 --> 01:45:56,171
- Shh!
- Your brother's talking.

1832
01:45:56,248 --> 01:45:57,476
Just sit down.

1833
01:45:57,550 --> 01:46:00,714
General Reginald Dyer
trapped them in a courtyard

1834
01:46:00,856 --> 01:46:05,819
and ordered his troops
to fire into the crowd for ten minutes.

1835
01:46:05,897 --> 01:46:07,923
379 died...

1836
01:46:07,967 --> 01:46:13,101
men, women, children...

1837
01:46:13,143 --> 01:46:14,873
Shot down in cold blood.

1838
01:46:14,979 --> 01:46:19,418
Dyer said he had
taught them a moral lesson.

1839
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:23,322
Gandhi and his followers responded
not with violence

1840
01:46:23,393 --> 01:46:27,695
but with an organized
campaign of non-cooperation.

1841
01:46:27,767 --> 01:46:30,430
Government buildings were occupied.

1842
01:46:30,505 --> 01:46:33,134
Streets were blocked
with people who refused to rise,

1843
01:46:33,210 --> 01:46:36,112
even when beaten by police.

1844
01:46:36,182 --> 01:46:38,583
Gandhi was arrested,

1845
01:46:38,653 --> 01:46:41,954
but the British were soon
forced to release him.

1846
01:46:42,025 --> 01:46:46,157
He called it a moral victory.

1847
01:46:46,232 --> 01:46:48,565
The definition of moral:

1848
01:46:48,669 --> 01:46:53,074
Dyer's lesson or Gandhi's victory?

1849
01:46:53,143 --> 01:46:54,610
You choose.

1850
01:46:57,182 --> 01:46:58,946
[Applause]

1851
01:47:12,374 --> 01:47:15,573
From 1914 to 1918,

1852
01:47:15,647 --> 01:47:20,849
for every single minute
the world was at war,

1853
01:47:20,922 --> 01:47:24,917
four men laid down their lives.

1854
01:47:25,029 --> 01:47:27,464
Just think of it.

1855
01:47:27,534 --> 01:47:32,770
240 brave young men
were hurled into eternity

1856
01:47:32,842 --> 01:47:36,245
every hour of every day, of every night,

1857
01:47:36,314 --> 01:47:39,011
for four long years.

1858
01:47:40,988 --> 01:47:44,426
35,000 hours.

1859
01:47:44,494 --> 01:47:50,903
8,281,000 casualties.

1860
01:47:52,844 --> 01:47:54,676
240.

1861
01:47:55,881 --> 01:47:58,009
240.

1862
01:47:58,119 --> 01:48:02,558
240.

1863
01:48:02,726 --> 01:48:04,159
Here was a slaughter

1864
01:48:04,229 --> 01:48:08,463
immeasurably greater than
what happened at Amritsar.

1865
01:48:08,502 --> 01:48:11,996
Can there be anything moral about it?

1866
01:48:13,377 --> 01:48:14,776
Nothing...

1867
01:48:14,845 --> 01:48:16,677
except that it stopped Germany

1868
01:48:16,749 --> 01:48:18,650
from enslaving all of Europe.

1869
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:23,591
Civil disobedience isn't moral
because it's non-violent.

1870
01:48:23,660 --> 01:48:26,630
Fighting for your country with violence

1871
01:48:26,698 --> 01:48:29,167
can be deeply moral,

1872
01:48:29,270 --> 01:48:34,438
demanding the greatest
sacrifice of all:

1873
01:48:34,546 --> 01:48:36,845
Life itself.

1874
01:48:36,916 --> 01:48:40,354
Non-violence is the mask
civil disobedience wears

1875
01:48:40,455 --> 01:48:43,984
to conceal its true face...

1876
01:48:44,061 --> 01:48:46,553
anarchy.

1877
01:48:58,017 --> 01:49:00,782
Gandhi believes one must always act

1878
01:49:00,956 --> 01:49:03,755
with love and respect
for one's opponents,

1879
01:49:03,859 --> 01:49:06,385
even if they are Harvard debaters.

1880
01:49:06,497 --> 01:49:07,964
[Laughter]

1881
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,938
Gandhi also believes
that lawbreakers must accept

1882
01:49:12,008 --> 01:49:15,275
the legal consequences for their actions.

1883
01:49:15,348 --> 01:49:17,476
Does that sound like anarchy?

1884
01:49:17,551 --> 01:49:22,821
Civil disobedience is not something
for us to fear.

1885
01:49:22,892 --> 01:49:25,919
It is, after all, an American concept.

1886
01:49:25,998 --> 01:49:28,331
You see, Gandhi draws his inspiration

1887
01:49:28,402 --> 01:49:30,200
not from a Hindu scripture,

1888
01:49:30,272 --> 01:49:32,264
but from Henry David Thoreau,

1889
01:49:32,341 --> 01:49:34,867
who I believe graduated from Harvard

1890
01:49:34,979 --> 01:49:45,229
and lived by a pond
not too far from here.

1891
01:49:45,230 --> 01:49:48,429
My opponent is right about one thing.

1892
01:49:48,502 --> 01:49:51,028
Thoreau was a Harvard grad,

1893
01:49:51,105 --> 01:49:55,840
and, like many of us, a bit self-righteous.

1894
01:49:55,914 --> 01:49:58,281
[Laughter]

1895
01:49:58,352 --> 01:50:03,554
He once said, "Any man
more right than his neighbors

1896
01:50:03,593 --> 01:50:07,326
constitutes a majority of one."

1897
01:50:07,367 --> 01:50:11,100
Thoreau the idealist could never know

1898
01:50:11,206 --> 01:50:15,235
that Adolf Hitler
would agree with his words.

1899
01:50:15,347 --> 01:50:20,481
The beauty and the burden
of democracy is this:

1900
01:50:20,555 --> 01:50:25,928
No idea prevails without
the support of the majority.

1901
01:50:25,996 --> 01:50:28,830
The people decide
the moral issues of the day,

1902
01:50:28,901 --> 01:50:31,268
not a majority of one.

1903
01:50:31,340 --> 01:50:35,802
Majorities do not decide
what is right or wrong.

1904
01:50:35,881 --> 01:50:37,850
Your conscience does.

1905
01:50:37,917 --> 01:50:40,580
So why should a citizen

1906
01:50:40,655 --> 01:50:43,147
surrender his or her conscience

1907
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:44,591
to a legislator?

1908
01:50:44,696 --> 01:50:48,862
No, we must never, ever kneel down

1909
01:50:48,936 --> 01:50:51,838
before the tyranny of a majority.

1910
01:50:51,908 --> 01:50:54,605
[Applause]

1911
01:50:56,783 --> 01:50:58,649
[Applause]

1912
01:51:00,288 --> 01:51:03,817
We can't decide which laws
to obey and which to ignore.

1913
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:06,486
If we could...

1914
01:51:06,565 --> 01:51:08,193
I'd never stop for a red light.

1915
01:51:08,234 --> 01:51:10,032
[Laughter]

1916
01:51:10,070 --> 01:51:12,096
My father is one of those men

1917
01:51:12,175 --> 01:51:15,908
that stands between us and chaos:

1918
01:51:16,015 --> 01:51:18,484
A police officer.

1919
01:51:18,586 --> 01:51:24,528
I remember the day
his partner, his best friend,

1920
01:51:24,595 --> 01:51:27,258
was gunned down in the line of duty.

1921
01:51:29,269 --> 01:51:32,034
Most vividly of all,

1922
01:51:32,107 --> 01:51:35,601
I remember the expression
on my dad's face.

1923
01:51:37,717 --> 01:51:43,625
Nothing that erodes
the rule of law can be moral,

1924
01:51:43,693 --> 01:51:48,223
no matter what name we give it.

1925
01:51:50,739 --> 01:51:52,503
Bravo!

1926
01:52:36,683 --> 01:52:37,809
Why doesn't he say something?

1927
01:52:37,885 --> 01:52:39,113
Shh!

1928
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:59,243
In Texas...

1929
01:52:59,353 --> 01:53:01,219
they lynch Negroes.

1930
01:53:03,627 --> 01:53:05,596
My teammates and I

1931
01:53:05,663 --> 01:53:09,931
saw a man strung up by his neck

1932
01:53:09,971 --> 01:53:11,529
and set on fire.

1933
01:53:14,011 --> 01:53:18,074
We drove through a lynch mob,

1934
01:53:18,151 --> 01:53:21,554
pressed our faces
against the floorboard.

1935
01:53:24,695 --> 01:53:27,722
I looked at my teammates.

1936
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:30,827
I saw the fear in their eyes...

1937
01:53:33,243 --> 01:53:36,213
and worse...

1938
01:53:36,315 --> 01:53:37,577
the shame.

1939
01:53:40,822 --> 01:53:43,417
What was this Negro's crime

1940
01:53:43,493 --> 01:53:45,928
that he should be hung, without trial,

1941
01:53:45,998 --> 01:53:48,559
in a dark forest filled with fog?

1942
01:53:48,635 --> 01:53:52,630
Was he a thief?

1943
01:53:52,710 --> 01:53:55,839
Was he a killer?

1944
01:53:55,915 --> 01:53:57,439
Or just a Negro?

1945
01:53:59,721 --> 01:54:02,350
Was he a sharecropper?

1946
01:54:02,525 --> 01:54:04,653
A preacher?

1947
01:54:04,762 --> 01:54:07,789
Were his children waiting up for him?

1948
01:54:07,834 --> 01:54:13,935
And who are we to just
lie there and do nothing?

1949
01:54:16,615 --> 01:54:21,817
No matter what he did,
the mob was the criminal.

1950
01:54:21,890 --> 01:54:25,191
But the law did nothing,

1951
01:54:25,262 --> 01:54:28,597
just left us wondering why.

1952
01:54:34,845 --> 01:54:36,711
My opponent says

1953
01:54:36,816 --> 01:54:40,982
nothing that erodes the rule
of law can be moral.

1954
01:54:41,089 --> 01:54:43,923
But there is no rule of law
in the Jim Crow South,

1955
01:54:43,994 --> 01:54:46,463
not when Negroes are denied housing,

1956
01:54:46,565 --> 01:54:49,091
turned away from schools, hospitals,

1957
01:54:49,170 --> 01:54:51,401
and not when we are lynched.

1958
01:54:55,947 --> 01:54:57,346
St. Augustine said,

1959
01:54:57,416 --> 01:55:01,946
"An unjust law is no law at all,"

1960
01:55:02,091 --> 01:55:03,923
which means I have a right,

1961
01:55:03,994 --> 01:55:06,657
even a duty, to resist...

1962
01:55:09,003 --> 01:55:13,704
with violence or civil disobedience.

1963
01:55:18,085 --> 01:55:20,611
You should pray I choose the latter.

1964
01:55:34,011 --> 01:55:36,105
Bravo!

1965
01:55:52,375 --> 01:55:53,637
