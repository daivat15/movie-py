00:01:05,578 --> 00:01:10,288
~ Welcome to New Tokyo 
International Airport. Welcome. ~

2
00:02:30,897 --> 00:02:32,865
- Welcome to Tokyo.
- Thank you very much.

3
00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:36,169
- My name is Kawasaki.
- Nice to meet you.

4
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:37,336
- For you.
- Thank you.

5
00:02:37,336 --> 00:02:39,372
- And Mr. Mori from Suntory.
- Hi.

6
00:02:39,372 --> 00:02:41,507
- And Miss Shibata.
- Hey, I need that.

7
00:02:41,507 --> 00:02:43,342
And Mr. Awinami.

8
00:02:43,342 --> 00:02:44,544
Nice to meet you.

9
00:02:44,544 --> 00:02:45,878
All right. Thank you.

10
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:48,347
- And Mr. Tanaka.
- Thank you. Thank you.

11
00:02:48,347 --> 00:02:50,783
And we will pick you up
in the morning?

12
00:02:50,783 --> 00:02:53,052
- Okay.
- Okay. 
- See you tomorrow.

13
00:02:53,052 --> 00:02:55,721
Great. Short and sweet.
Very Japanese. I like that.

14
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:57,023
My pleasure.

15
00:02:57,023 --> 00:02:58,591
Yeah, get some sleep, will you?

16
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:01,761
We're all ... You're all really tired, 
I'm sure. See you tomorrow.

17
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:03,663
- Good night.
- Thank you. Thank you.

18
00:03:03,663 --> 00:03:05,608
Thank you ... What's this?

19
00:03:05,765 --> 00:03:07,244
Something good?

20
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:15,683
Thank you.

21
00:03:25,818 --> 00:03:28,487
- Mr. Harris, welcome to Park Hyatt Tokyo.
- Yeah.

22
00:03:28,487 --> 00:03:30,125
This way, please.

23
00:03:32,091 --> 00:03:34,093
Mr. Harris, pleased to welcome.

24
00:03:34,093 --> 00:03:35,494
- Thank you.
- Have a nice stay with us.

25
00:03:35,494 --> 00:03:36,973
This way.

26
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:40,967
Mr. Harris, 
welcome to Park Hyatt Tokyo.

27
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:42,335
- Thank you.
- Enjoy your stay with us.

28
00:03:42,335 --> 00:03:43,541
Thank you very much.

33
00:04:35,388 --> 00:04:36,525
Yeah.

34
00:04:37,323 --> 00:04:39,492
- You see that guy?
- Yeah.

35
00:04:39,492 --> 00:04:40,993
You know who that is?

36
00:04:40,993 --> 00:04:42,094
It's not him.

37
00:04:42,094 --> 00:04:44,196
It looks like him, but it's not him.

38
00:04:44,196 --> 00:04:46,198
Can you believe it?

39
00:04:46,198 --> 00:04:47,333
Okay, maybe it is.

40
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,768
He's here with us.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

41
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:50,069
Shut up. Shut up.

42
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:53,205
Bob? Bob Harris?
You're awesome, man!

43
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:55,274
Sunset Odds. Loved it.

44
00:04:55,274 --> 00:04:58,110
- Man, that car chase,
- I couldn't believe it.

45
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,113
Four buses ... and he took that 
thing and everything exploded.

46
00:05:01,113 --> 00:05:03,282
- I heard he did his own driving.
- I don't know.

47
00:05:03,282 --> 00:05:05,084
Did you do your own driving?

48
00:05:05,084 --> 00:05:06,519
- I did.
- Cool.

49
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,953
So, what are you doing here?

50
00:05:07,953 --> 00:05:09,193
Yeah.

51
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,825
Um ... seeing friends. 
Seeing friends.

52
00:05:12,825 --> 00:05:14,736
- Yeah?
- Great.

53
00:05:15,027 --> 00:05:16,195
We're here on business.

54
00:05:16,195 --> 00:05:17,763
♪ I can see it in your eyes ♪

55
00:05:17,763 --> 00:05:19,031
Later.

56
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:20,134
- See you, Bob. 
- Keep it up.

57
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:23,433
Are you awake?

58
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,401
John.

59
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:33,975
Go to sleep.

60
00:07:38,938 --> 00:07:40,940
Moshi moshi.

61
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,885
Yeah, I'm coming down.

62
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,683
Okay.

63
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:47,947
I gotta go to work.

64
00:07:47,947 --> 00:07:49,114
Okay.

65
00:07:49,114 --> 00:07:50,716
I love you. I'll see you later.

66
00:07:50,716 --> 00:07:51,819
Okay. Bye.

67
00:08:55,114 --> 00:08:56,320
Mr. Bob-san.

68
00:09:03,522 --> 00:09:05,194
Suntory whisky.

69
00:09:18,137 --> 00:09:19,809
Casablanca. Bogie.

70
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,783
Suntory time.

71
00:09:23,676 --> 00:09:26,315
He want you to turn, look in camera.

72
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:28,286
Okay?

73
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:30,749
That's all he said?

74
00:09:30,749 --> 00:09:31,852
Yes.

75
00:09:32,017 --> 00:09:33,359
Turn to camera.

76
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,625
All right, does he want me
to turn from the right,

77
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,332
or turn from the left?

78
00:10:06,619 --> 00:10:09,555
Passionate. Camera. Passion.

79
00:10:09,555 --> 00:10:12,399
Right side and with intensity.

80
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:14,193
Okay?

81
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:16,829
Is that everything? I mean, 
it seemed like he said ...

82
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:18,530
quite a bit more than that.

83
00:10:19,965 --> 00:10:21,910
Whisky.

84
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:27,413
Gently.

85
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:31,176
Tension.

86
00:10:31,176 --> 00:10:34,247
Like an old friend,
and into the camera.

87
00:10:35,214 --> 00:10:36,488
Okay.

88
00:10:38,384 --> 00:10:39,985
Whisky.

89
00:10:39,985 --> 00:10:42,897
It's Suntory time! Okay?

90
00:10:43,789 --> 00:10:44,926
Okay.

91
00:10:45,357 --> 00:10:46,460
Okay?

92
00:10:48,394 --> 00:10:50,965
- Hey, come on!
- Come on, come on, come on.

93
00:10:58,771 --> 00:11:00,477
For relaxing times,

94
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,246
make it Suntory time.

95
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:07,123
Cut-o! Cut-o, cut-o,
cut-o, cut-o, cut-o!

96
00:11:17,923 --> 00:11:19,391
Could you do it slower ...

97
00:11:19,391 --> 00:11:23,100
and with more intensity?

98
00:11:27,566 --> 00:11:29,045
Suntory time.

99
00:11:45,517 --> 00:11:47,428
For relaxing times,

100
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:51,161
make it Suntory time.

101
00:11:55,794 --> 00:11:57,773
Cut-o, cut-o, cut-o, cut-o!

102
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,308
Hello?

103
00:13:16,308 --> 00:13:17,442
Lauren?

104
00:13:17,442 --> 00:13:18,716
Charlotte! Hey!

105
00:13:19,478 --> 00:13:20,679
Hey.

106
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:22,014
Oh, my God. How's Tokyo?

107
00:13:22,014 --> 00:13:25,290
It's great here.
It's really great. Um ...

108
00:13:25,717 --> 00:13:27,653
I don't know ...
I went to this shrine today.

109
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:29,359
- Mmm-hmm?
- And ...

110
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:33,592
there were these monks,
and they were chanting.

111
00:13:33,592 --> 00:13:37,696
And I didn't feel anything.
You know?

112
00:13:37,696 --> 00:13:41,109
And I don't know ...

113
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:44,736
I even tried ikebana, and John 
is using these hair products.

114
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:46,572
I just ...
I don't know who I married.

115
00:13:46,572 --> 00:13:49,007
Look, can you wait a second?
Just hold on. I'll be right back.

116
00:13:49,007 --> 00:13:50,383
Okay, sure.

117
00:13:52,077 --> 00:13:54,079
Sorry. What were you saying?

118
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,215
Nothing. It's okay.
I'll call you later. Okay?

119
00:13:56,215 --> 00:14:00,419
Okay. Have the best time. Just call 
me when you get back. Okay? Bye.

120
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:01,659
- Bye.
- Love you.

121
00:15:09,254 --> 00:15:10,733
God!

122
00:15:10,989 --> 00:15:12,490
Ow.

123
00:15:16,094 --> 00:15:18,540
At the fitting today,
they had all these ...

124
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:20,666
rock-and-roll clothes,

125
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,567
but the band wasn't tough at all.

126
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:24,703
The label guy just kept saying,
"More lock and loll,"

127
00:15:24,703 --> 00:15:26,204
but it's just so much better ...

128
00:15:26,204 --> 00:15:29,441
if they're just skinny and nerdy
like they came in, you know.

129
00:15:29,441 --> 00:15:32,144
They're making them wear all these
Keith Richards clothes,

130
00:15:32,144 --> 00:15:33,512
and it's just ridiculous.

131
00:15:33,512 --> 00:15:36,381
They should let them be who they are.
Don't you think? I mean ...

132
00:15:36,381 --> 00:15:37,816
Yeah.

133
00:15:37,816 --> 00:15:39,518
Yeah, that's exactly
what I was saying.

134
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:42,692
But then you try to ...
I mean, you know ...

135
00:15:43,622 --> 00:15:45,624
That's what I think.

136
00:15:45,624 --> 00:15:47,626
Do you think this is done?

137
00:15:50,395 --> 00:15:52,875
I don't know. I don't know.

138
00:15:54,032 --> 00:15:58,003
Would you ... 
Would you please stop smoking?

139
00:15:58,003 --> 00:16:00,005
I like to. I don't really
smoke that much.

140
00:16:00,005 --> 00:16:02,951
It's just so bad for you, though.

141
00:16:03,108 --> 00:16:04,746
Well, I'll stop later.

142
00:16:17,255 --> 00:16:18,790
Welcome back, Mr. Harris.

143
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,992
Yes, Mr. Harris.

144
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:22,096
- Please.
- Thank you.

145
00:17:03,835 --> 00:17:05,504
- Mr. Harris?
- Yes?

146
00:17:05,504 --> 00:17:07,672
- Mr. Kazu sent me.
- Oh?

147
00:17:07,672 --> 00:17:09,116
May I enter?

148
00:17:11,977 --> 00:17:13,211
Thank you.

149
00:17:13,211 --> 00:17:14,712
Do you like massage?

150
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:19,051
I don't think
I like massage anymore.

151
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:22,122
Mr. Kazu sends premium fantasy.

152
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:26,468
My stockings, lip them.

153
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:31,803
Lip my stockings.

154
00:17:33,331 --> 00:17:34,707
Yes, please.

155
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,607
Lip them.

156
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,805
What?

157
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:41,215
Lip them.

158
00:17:43,241 --> 00:17:45,477
Hey! Lip my stocking!

159
00:17:45,477 --> 00:17:48,146
Hey! "Lip" them?
"Lip" them? What?

160
00:17:48,146 --> 00:17:51,216
Lip them. Like this.
Lip them.

161
00:17:51,216 --> 00:17:52,717
- Rip them?
- Lip, yes.

162
00:17:52,717 --> 00:17:54,319
You want me to rip
your stockings?

163
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:56,254
Yes, lip my stockings, please.

164
00:17:56,254 --> 00:17:57,722
- Rip your stockings.
- Yes.

165
00:17:57,722 --> 00:17:59,724
- You want me to rip your stockings.
- Please? Please? Please?

166
00:17:59,724 --> 00:18:01,226
All right, I'm gonna
rip your stockings,

167
00:18:01,226 --> 00:18:03,829
and you tell Mr. Kazu ... 
you know ... we had a blast.

168
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:06,665
Oh, no! Mr. Harris!
Oh, my God!

169
00:18:06,665 --> 00:18:08,266
Don't touch me!

170
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:11,372
Mr. Bob Harris, don't touch me!

171
00:18:11,803 --> 00:18:13,505
Just lip my stocking!

172
00:18:13,505 --> 00:18:16,144
Oh, no, Mr. Harris!

173
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,811
- Oh, no! Help! Help!
- Yeah. Yeah.

174
00:18:19,811 --> 00:18:22,114
- Help, please! Help, please!
- Okay.

175
00:18:22,114 --> 00:18:24,082
- Mr. Harris, help, please.
- Careful with those.

176
00:18:24,082 --> 00:18:28,053
- Oh! Help, please! Help, please!
- Come on. Come on.

177
00:18:28,053 --> 00:18:30,489
Let me go, Mr. Harris!

178
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:32,824
- Oh, no! Let me go!
- Come on. Come on.

179
00:18:32,824 --> 00:18:36,294
- Oh! Let me go! Let me go.
- Oh, crap.

180
00:18:36,294 --> 00:18:37,462
- Please let me go.
- With pleasure.

181
00:18:37,462 --> 00:18:42,035
Oh, no, Mr. Bob Harris,
don't let me go! No!

182
00:18:42,234 --> 00:18:46,238
No! Oh, no, Mr. Bob Harris!

183
00:18:47,572 --> 00:18:49,174
Oh, please.

184
00:18:49,174 --> 00:18:50,550
Let me go, please!

185
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:39,925
Hi! Mr. Harris, good morning.

186
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:41,126
Hi.

187
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:43,628
Hello. We just got
a request from Tanabe Mori.

188
00:19:43,628 --> 00:19:45,230
He is the Johnny Carson of Japan.

189
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:48,166
It is a big honor to
be invited to his show.

190
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,168
Can you stay here until Friday?

191
00:19:51,469 --> 00:19:55,340
I'm surprised and honored, but I 
think I need to check with my agent.

192
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,742
- Okay.
- I believe I may have a previous commitment.

193
00:19:57,742 --> 00:19:59,544
- Sure.
- Okay. I understand.

194
00:19:59,544 --> 00:20:01,023
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

195
00:20:23,501 --> 00:20:24,603
I think you should do it.

196
00:20:24,603 --> 00:20:26,471
No, hear this, Fred.

197
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:29,341
I gotta be on a plane
Thursday night.

198
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:30,976
We're looking into it, Bob.

199
00:20:30,976 --> 00:20:33,845
They really want you to stay 
and do that talk show.

200
00:20:33,845 --> 00:20:36,257
Apparently, he's a really big deal ...

201
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:39,184
Johnny Carson of Japan. Yeah.

202
00:20:39,184 --> 00:20:42,687
Bob, these people are paying you a lot.
Would you please consider it?

203
00:20:42,687 --> 00:20:45,890
I already have. You know, 
I gotta get out of here.

204
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,325
As soon as I can.

205
00:20:47,325 --> 00:20:49,160
All right, you're scheduled
to leave Friday,

206
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,962
but we'll hold it for you Saturday.

207
00:20:50,962 --> 00:20:52,230
All right, now ...

208
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:55,567
You're breaking up, Fred. There's 
no reception in this studio.

209
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:57,273
Forget it. Call me back.

210
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,080
So, can you put your hand
close your face, please?

211
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,515
I'm sorry, Naka. What?

212
00:21:10,515 --> 00:21:14,793
Can you put your hand close 
your face? Close your face.

213
00:21:17,889 --> 00:21:20,692
I don't get that close to the 
glass until I'm on the floor.

214
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:21,893
How's this?

215
00:21:22,994 --> 00:21:25,440
Yes. You want a whisky?

216
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:31,536
This is not whiskey. This is iced tea.
If you gave me real whisky ...

217
00:21:31,536 --> 00:21:33,571
I need mysterious face.

218
00:21:33,571 --> 00:21:35,774
Can you show mysterious?
Mysterious.

219
00:21:35,774 --> 00:21:38,543
I think I know what you want.
You want this, right?

220
00:21:38,543 --> 00:21:41,182
I need more mysterious and ...

221
00:21:41,413 --> 00:21:42,580
More mysterious. Yeah.

222
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,650
I'll just try to think,
"Where the hell's the whisky?"

223
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,256
You are a movie star, yes?

224
00:21:51,256 --> 00:21:53,958
Yes, I should be doing movies, 
yes, but ...

225
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,334
And Lat Pack.

226
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,664
Lat Pack.
You know Lat Pack?

227
00:21:58,463 --> 00:22:00,231
- Rat ... Rat Pack?
- Rat Pack. Yes, please.

228
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:01,607
Oh, Rat Pack.

229
00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:09,250
I need more tension, please.

230
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:12,410
More ...

231
00:22:15,714 --> 00:22:17,625
You so gentleman, yes?

232
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:19,989
- A Ring-a-Ding Ding!
- Yeah.

233
00:22:21,219 --> 00:22:23,221
Sinatora. You know Sinatora?

234
00:22:24,723 --> 00:22:26,361
- Ol' Blue Eyes.
- Yeah.

235
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:29,294
That's good. Yeah.

236
00:22:29,294 --> 00:22:30,929
That's more of Dino. That's Dino.

237
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:32,271
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

238
00:22:32,964 --> 00:22:34,170
Great.

239
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:37,439
- Joey Bishop would you like?
- Yes. Just change film.

240
00:22:42,674 --> 00:22:44,542
Are you drinking? No?

241
00:22:44,542 --> 00:22:45,610
- Am I drinking?
- Yeah.

242
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,278
As soon as I'm done.

243
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:49,114
- Okay, close your hand, please.
- Huh?

244
00:22:49,114 --> 00:22:51,116
- Close your hand. Yeah.
- Close it?

245
00:22:51,116 --> 00:22:53,218
Yes. Close your face, please.

246
00:22:53,218 --> 00:22:55,220
- Close my ... 
- Yes. Sorry.

247
00:22:56,521 --> 00:22:58,432
And 007?

248
00:22:58,757 --> 00:23:00,492
He drinks martinis, but okay, 
I got it.

249
00:23:00,492 --> 00:23:02,026
007, yeah.

250
00:23:02,026 --> 00:23:03,266
Loger Moore?

251
00:23:03,695 --> 00:23:05,530
- Loger Moore? 
- Loger Moore.

252
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,132
You know Loger Moore?

253
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:08,333
- Roger Moore?
- Yeah.

254
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,335
Okay. I ...

255
00:23:10,335 --> 00:23:11,536
I always think of Sean Connery.
Seriously.

256
00:23:11,536 --> 00:23:12,670
No, no.

257
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:13,938
Didn't you get the Sean Connery
one over here?

258
00:23:13,938 --> 00:23:16,008
- No. Loger Moore.
- Okay.

259
00:23:16,841 --> 00:23:18,047
Yes.

260
00:23:18,576 --> 00:23:20,180
- Loger Moore? 
- No ...

261
00:23:20,545 --> 00:23:22,422
- Yeah. 
- Okay.

262
00:23:22,914 --> 00:23:25,121
Yeah, okay. Good.

263
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,852
More. Please.

264
00:23:27,852 --> 00:23:30,764
- You mean "more," or Roger Moore again?
- Yeah. Yeah.

265
00:23:32,023 --> 00:23:33,365
Good.

266
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,195

We're glad to be here.

We're Sausalito.

They're beautiful.

Send these over to
that table over there.

Excuse me, sir.
From the woman over there.

00:24:43,695 --> 00:24:46,004
Oh! Oh, they are?

00:24:47,699 --> 00:24:51,236
Is Japan ... 
Is it mainly Buddhism here?

285
00:24:51,236 --> 00:24:53,238
Yeah, it's Buddhism.

286
00:24:53,938 --> 00:24:56,307

289
00:25:01,246 --> 00:25:02,952
That's a beautiful job.

290
00:25:36,814 --> 00:25:38,315
Help!

00:26:05,209 --> 00:26:07,211
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Fine.

294
00:26:08,746 --> 00:26:10,623
Car is outside. Shall we go?

295
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,859
That's what I told him.

296
00:26:17,155 --> 00:26:18,790
- But if ...
- Yeah.

297
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,530
- He never listens.
- Yeah.

298
00:26:23,728 --> 00:26:25,366
John?

299
00:26:25,763 --> 00:26:28,539
Oh, my God! John!
What are you doing here?

300
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,737
Oh, well, you know,
I'm just here, shooting a band.

301
00:26:32,737 --> 00:26:33,805
What about you?

302
00:26:33,805 --> 00:26:35,106
I'm here promoting that
action movie I did.

303
00:26:36,174 --> 00:26:39,243
You know! I'm doing
20 million interviews a day.

304
00:26:39,243 --> 00:26:40,912
It's crazy.

305
00:26:40,912 --> 00:26:43,281
- God, it is so good to see you!
- Yeah. Yeah.

306
00:26:43,281 --> 00:26:44,882
So, how long are you gonna be here?

307
00:26:44,882 --> 00:26:47,018
We're here for a week.

308
00:26:47,018 --> 00:26:48,553
I'm gonna go shoot in Fukawaka.

309
00:26:49,654 --> 00:26:51,189
- Oh, it's amazing!
- Yeah.

310
00:26:51,189 --> 00:26:53,057
- It's amazing.
- Oh, yeah.

311
00:26:56,294 --> 00:26:59,263
Oh, this is ... 
This is my wife, Charlotte.

312
00:26:59,263 --> 00:27:00,765
Hi! It's really nice to meet you!

313
00:27:00,765 --> 00:27:02,000
Hi. Nice to meet you.

314
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,501
- Hello!

315
00:27:04,769 --> 00:27:06,714
- Wife?
- Yeah. Yeah.

316
00:27:07,572 --> 00:27:09,507
- John. John.
- Huh?

317
00:27:09,507 --> 00:27:10,975
You are my favorite photographer.

318
00:27:10,975 --> 00:27:14,012
- Oh, come on!
- No, you are. 
I only want you to shoot me.

319
00:27:15,513 --> 00:27:17,458
It's true!

320
00:27:17,782 --> 00:27:21,285
I have the worst B.O. right now.
I'm so sorry.

321
00:27:21,285 --> 00:27:23,554
No, no, no. But listen,

322
00:27:23,554 --> 00:27:25,723
let's all go out for a drink sometime.
- Yeah.

323
00:27:25,723 --> 00:27:29,293
- You know? Call me. Okay?
- Yeah. Okay.

324
00:27:29,293 --> 00:27:31,295
Listen, I'm under Evelyn Waugh.

325
00:27:31,763 --> 00:27:33,531
- Oh, oh, oh.
- Shh. Okay?

326
00:27:33,531 --> 00:27:35,133
- Okay. 
- Yeah.

327
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:37,010
Okay, arigato, arigato.

328
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:39,011
Moshi moshi!

329
00:27:40,438 --> 00:27:41,873
Evelyn Waugh?

330
00:27:41,873 --> 00:27:43,818
- What?
- Evelyn Waugh was a man.

331
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:45,982
Oh, come on. She's nice.

332
00:27:47,345 --> 00:27:50,416
What? You know ... you know, 
not everybody went to Yale.

333
00:27:51,683 --> 00:27:54,252
It was just a pseudonym,
for Christ's sake.

334
00:27:54,252 --> 00:27:56,187
Why do you have to defend her?

335
00:27:56,187 --> 00:27:59,257
Well, why do you have to point out 
how stupid everybody is all the time?

336
00:27:59,257 --> 00:28:01,396
I thought it was funny.
Forget it.

337
00:28:01,926 --> 00:28:03,336
Well ...

338
00:28:04,295 --> 00:28:07,207
- Hey, John, we gotta go.
- Oh. Yeah.

339
00:28:07,532 --> 00:28:08,908
Bye.

340
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:15,273
Did you ever wonder what
your purpose in life is?

341
00:28:15,273 --> 00:28:18,876
This book is about finding 
your soul's purpose or destiny.

342
00:28:18,876 --> 00:28:22,915
Every soul has its path, but 
sometimes that path is not clear.

343
00:28:23,214 --> 00:28:25,550
The Inner Map Theory
is an example ...

344
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,618
of how each soul begins 
with an imprint,

345
00:28:27,618 --> 00:28:31,022
all compacted into a pattern that 
has been selected by your soul ...

346
00:28:31,022 --> 00:28:32,660
before you've even gotten here.

347
00:28:37,762 --> 00:28:42,033
You know, I guess the reason why
I like Japan the best ...

348
00:28:42,033 --> 00:28:43,534
out of all Asian countries,

349
00:28:43,534 --> 00:28:48,072
is because I really feel
close to Buddhism.

350
00:28:48,072 --> 00:28:49,273
I really feel ...

351
00:28:49,273 --> 00:28:51,209
I really believe in reincarnation.

352
00:28:51,209 --> 00:28:54,378
That's part of what drew me
to Midnight Velocity as well,

353
00:28:54,378 --> 00:28:57,215
because although Keanu dies,

354
00:28:57,215 --> 00:28:59,784
he eventually gets reincarnated.

355
00:28:59,784 --> 00:29:02,954
So there's hope. There's hope 
in reincarnation, I think.

356
00:29:02,954 --> 00:29:05,923
What was it like
working with Keanu Reeves?

357
00:29:05,923 --> 00:29:09,994
He was always so ... He was always, 
you know, giving me ideas,

358
00:29:09,994 --> 00:29:11,596
and, you know, really helpful.

359
00:29:11,596 --> 00:29:13,631
He made me feel 
really comfortable, so ...

360
00:29:13,631 --> 00:29:17,735
And we both have two dogs,
and we both live in L.A.,

361
00:29:17,735 --> 00:29:20,681
so we have all these
different things in common.

362
00:29:20,972 --> 00:29:23,875
So, you know, we both
really like Mexican food,

363
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:26,878
and yoga and ...

364
00:29:26,878 --> 00:29:28,246
karate!

365
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,087
Mexican food. Yoga.

366
00:29:48,933 --> 00:29:50,201
Konnichiwa.

367
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:51,873
- Hello. 
- Hi.

368
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:12,697
Okay.

369
00:30:18,763 --> 00:30:21,709
- Okay.
- Okay.

370
00:31:34,505 --> 00:31:36,678
He got married
a couple of times ...

371
00:31:38,643 --> 00:31:39,844
to some nice women.

372
00:31:39,844 --> 00:31:43,047
Beautiful women too. I mean, you and 
I would be crazy for these women.

373
00:31:43,047 --> 00:31:45,220
But there were always rumors.

374
00:31:46,384 --> 00:31:47,952
I never liked his acting,

375
00:31:47,952 --> 00:31:50,955
so I never gave a damn
whether he was straight or not.

376
00:31:50,955 --> 00:31:53,162
Thank you. Hi. Thanks.

377
00:31:53,758 --> 00:31:55,293
What can I get you?

378
00:31:56,761 --> 00:31:58,035
I'm not sure.

379
00:32:00,965 --> 00:32:03,501
For relaxing times,

380
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:05,503
make it Suntory time.

381
00:32:08,439 --> 00:32:09,807
I'll have a vodka tonic.

382
00:32:10,942 --> 00:32:12,284
Thanks.

383
00:32:17,682 --> 00:32:19,525
So, what are you doing here?

384
00:32:21,152 --> 00:32:22,722
A couple of things.

385
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,362
Taking a break from my wife,
forgetting my son's birthday ...

386
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:29,360
and getting paid $2 million ...

387
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,430
to endorse a whisky ...

388
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:34,306
when I could be doing
a play somewhere.

389
00:32:36,033 --> 00:32:37,204
Oh.

390
00:32:38,336 --> 00:32:40,748
But the good news is,
the whisky works.

391
00:32:48,412 --> 00:32:49,913
What are you doing?

392
00:32:52,283 --> 00:32:53,718
My husband's a photographer,

393
00:32:53,718 --> 00:32:56,061
so he's here working,

394
00:32:56,721 --> 00:32:58,823
and I wasn't doing anything,
so I came along.

395
00:32:58,823 --> 00:33:01,235
And we have some friends
that live here.

396
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:03,160
How long have you
been married?

397
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,400
Thank you.

398
00:33:06,263 --> 00:33:07,469
Two years.

399
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:09,970
Twenty-five long ones.

400
00:33:11,769 --> 00:33:14,408
You're probably just
having a midlife crisis.

401
00:33:15,406 --> 00:33:17,146
Did you buy a Porsche yet?

402
00:33:19,043 --> 00:33:21,785
You know, I was thinking
about buying a Porsche.

403
00:33:25,449 --> 00:33:28,191
Twenty-five years. That's a ...

404
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,624
Well, it's impressive.

405
00:33:33,591 --> 00:33:36,970
Well, you figure you sleep
one-third of your life.

406
00:33:37,261 --> 00:33:39,497
That knocks off eight years of
marriage right there.

407
00:33:39,497 --> 00:33:41,999
So you're down to 16 and change.

408
00:33:41,999 --> 00:33:44,135
You're just a teenager at marriage.

409
00:33:44,135 --> 00:33:47,707
You can drive it, but there's 
still the occasional accident.

410
00:33:47,905 --> 00:33:49,008
Yeah.

411
00:33:50,608 --> 00:33:51,916
What do you do?

412
00:33:56,414 --> 00:33:58,416
I'm not sure yet, actually.

413
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:00,327
I just graduated last spring.

414
00:34:01,185 --> 00:34:02,720
What did you study?

415
00:34:02,887 --> 00:34:04,297
Philosophy.

416
00:34:05,222 --> 00:34:07,124
Yeah, there's a good buck
in that racket.

417
00:34:07,124 --> 00:34:08,398
Yeah.

418
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:12,338
Well, so far it's pro bono.

419
00:34:14,365 --> 00:34:16,133
Well, I'm sure you'll
figure out the angles.

420
00:34:16,133 --> 00:34:17,270
Yeah.

421
00:34:19,904 --> 00:34:22,145
I hope your Porsche works out.

422
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,442
Cheers to that, huh?

423
00:34:24,442 --> 00:34:25,709
Cheers to that.

424
00:34:37,621 --> 00:34:39,156
Wish I could sleep.

425
00:34:39,156 --> 00:34:40,430
Me, too.

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,462
Oh, it was good, you know.
I'm tired.

434
00:36:51,855 --> 00:36:55,092
Yeah, I gotta go downstairs
and meet Kelly for some drinks.

435
00:36:55,092 --> 00:36:57,194
She wants to talk about
some photo thing.

436
00:36:57,194 --> 00:36:59,333
Maybe I'll go downstairs with you.

437
00:36:59,964 --> 00:37:01,443
Oh, you wanna come?

438
00:37:01,732 --> 00:37:03,006
Yeah, sure.

00:37:03,434 --> 00:37:05,811

Everybody is always like,
"Kelly, you are anorexic."

443
00:37:17,848 --> 00:37:19,450
And I'm like, "No, I'm not."

444
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:22,286
I eat so much junk food,
you wouldn't believe it.

445
00:37:22,286 --> 00:37:24,021
Just because I have
a high metabolism.

446
00:37:24,021 --> 00:37:26,023
Because I thought
you were anorexic too.

447
00:37:26,023 --> 00:37:27,524
Everybody does.
Everybody thinks that.

448
00:37:27,524 --> 00:37:29,560
Yeah, 'cause you look so ...

449
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,729
Thank you. I know, but it's ...

450
00:37:31,729 --> 00:37:34,598
I mean, I eat whatever.
I have a really high metabolism.

451
00:37:34,598 --> 00:37:36,168
- Yeah.
- But ...

452
00:37:38,836 --> 00:37:40,975
My dad is an anorexic.

453
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:44,518
- Really?
- Oh, really?

454
00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:46,210
Yeah.

455
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:50,158
He fought on the American side 
of the Bay of Pigs in Cuba.

456
00:37:50,714 --> 00:37:52,182
He was taken prisoner,

457
00:37:52,182 --> 00:37:55,653
and the whole time he was there 
they tortured him about food.

458
00:37:55,653 --> 00:37:58,656
Every day they told him
they put poison in the food.

459
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,925
So they would always make themselves 
throw up after every meal.

460
00:38:01,925 --> 00:38:04,632
That's horrible. That's terrible.

461
00:38:05,929 --> 00:38:07,431
That's some crazy shit.

462
00:38:07,431 --> 00:38:08,799
- You don't think he sounds kinda goofy?
- No.

463
00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:10,835
You know that break beat, right?

464
00:38:11,368 --> 00:38:13,237
Well, I been taking it
to some next level shit.

465
00:38:13,237 --> 00:38:15,606
Like, I'll take that and put 
a delay on it, so it's like ...

466
00:38:18,709 --> 00:38:21,078
So it's, like, evolving the beat.

467
00:38:21,078 --> 00:38:24,957
So it, like, sounds hella large on 
the track. You know what I'm saying?

468
00:38:25,616 --> 00:38:27,117
- No.
- No?

469
00:38:27,117 --> 00:38:28,960
You don't listen to hip-hop?

470
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,459
Oh, my God!
You guys gotta listen.

471
00:38:31,922 --> 00:38:34,692
I tried this power cleanse.
It's so amazing.

472
00:38:34,692 --> 00:38:36,093
Okay, promise me you'll try it.

473
00:38:36,093 --> 00:38:37,594
Will you try this power cleanse?

474
00:38:37,594 --> 00:38:39,530
- I did it last week, and it's amazing. 
- I'll be right back.

475
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:42,666
It's so good to get the toxins
out of your body, you know.

476
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:45,840
With all, like, the pollution,
all, like, the ...

477
00:38:50,507 --> 00:38:52,409
- Hello.
- Hello.

478
00:38:52,409 --> 00:38:54,183
You ever switch seats?

479
00:38:56,313 --> 00:38:59,316
I like this one. If I fall,
someone will notice.

480
00:39:00,284 --> 00:39:01,490
Yeah.

481
00:39:02,386 --> 00:39:04,229
So, you having a nice time?

482
00:39:04,855 --> 00:39:06,459
Can you keep a secret?

483
00:39:06,824 --> 00:39:09,026
I'm trying to organize
a prison break.

484
00:39:09,026 --> 00:39:11,061
I'm looking for, like,
an accomplice.

485
00:39:12,396 --> 00:39:15,532
We'd have to, first,
get out of this bar.

486
00:39:15,532 --> 00:39:19,536
Then the hotel, then the city 
and then the country.

487
00:39:19,536 --> 00:39:21,438
Are you in, or are you out?

488
00:39:21,438 --> 00:39:22,539
I'm in.

489
00:39:22,539 --> 00:39:24,541
Good. I'll go pack my stuff.

490
00:39:24,541 --> 00:39:25,642
Get your coat.

491
00:39:25,642 --> 00:39:26,813
See you.

492
00:39:27,411 --> 00:39:30,255
I hope you've had enough to drink.
It's gonna take courage.

493
00:39:37,087 --> 00:39:40,466
Oh, look. The label got me these.

494
00:39:40,891 --> 00:39:43,428
I love Cristal.
You wanna have some?

495
00:39:44,094 --> 00:39:47,837
Well, I'm ... I gotta go.
I mean, I ...

496
00:39:50,701 --> 00:39:53,303
You know, you don't have to stay.

497
00:39:53,303 --> 00:39:54,438
I mean ...

498
00:39:54,438 --> 00:39:55,672
You don't have to go, do you?

499
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,709
Well, I ...

500
00:39:58,709 --> 00:40:00,577
I know. You're gonna be
working the whole time.

501
00:40:00,577 --> 00:40:01,812
I'll have a much better time here.

502
00:40:01,812 --> 00:40:03,113
I'll call Charlie and those guys.

503
00:40:03,113 --> 00:40:05,092
Yeah! Call those guys.

504
00:40:05,849 --> 00:40:08,329
And I'm gonna be back
on Sunday, and I ...

505
00:40:09,253 --> 00:40:10,925
I love you, you know.

506
00:40:14,158 --> 00:40:16,001
Okay? I love you.

507
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,565
I'll see you. Okay?

508
00:40:21,565 --> 00:40:24,001
Yeah, it's just gonna be a couple 
of ... a couple of days.

509
00:40:24,001 --> 00:40:25,135
Bye.

510
00:40:25,135 --> 00:40:26,341
I love you.

511
00:41:31,602 --> 00:41:32,970
Hello.

512
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,271
- Hello. 
- How are you?

513
00:41:34,271 --> 00:41:35,681
- Good. How are you?

514
00:41:41,044 --> 00:41:42,279
It's a cool pool, isn't it?

515
00:41:42,279 --> 00:41:43,689
Yeah, it's nice.

516
00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:47,584
Get any sleep?

517
00:41:47,584 --> 00:41:49,757
Not yet. How about you?

518
00:41:50,287 --> 00:41:52,232
No. Not yet.

519
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:55,325
How long you staying for?

520
00:41:55,325 --> 00:41:57,694
I'll be in the bar for
the rest of the week.

521
00:41:59,696 --> 00:42:01,436
Well, that's good.

522
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:06,176
I'm going out with some friends 
later, if you wanna come ...

523
00:42:07,237 --> 00:42:08,338
Sure.

524
00:42:08,338 --> 00:42:10,147
Okay. I'll see you later.

525
00:42:10,908 --> 00:42:12,352
- Okay.
- See you.

526
00:42:43,774 --> 00:42:45,150
Which one is burgundy?

527
00:42:47,244 --> 00:42:48,412
Hold on!

528
00:42:49,613 --> 00:42:50,819
Hold on.

529
00:42:55,018 --> 00:42:57,788
You really are having
a midlife crisis, huh?

530
00:42:57,788 --> 00:43:00,063
Really? Yeah, I was afraid of that.

531
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:05,171
I kept telling myself that I just wanted 
to be ready in case we go to war tonight.

532
00:43:08,932 --> 00:43:11,071
My bathroom is messier than yours.

533
00:43:16,373 --> 00:43:18,475
And it's not like you're not trying.

534
00:43:18,475 --> 00:43:20,310
Here, will you cut the tag out for me?

535
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:21,413
Sure.

536
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,256
You're too tall.

537
00:43:28,051 --> 00:43:30,153
Anybody ever tell you,
you may be too small?

538
00:43:31,254 --> 00:43:32,322
Whose is this?

539
00:43:32,322 --> 00:43:34,995
"A Soul's Search: 
Finding Your True Calling."

540
00:43:35,325 --> 00:43:36,565
I don't know.

541
00:43:37,794 --> 00:43:40,399
- I have that. 
- Did it work out for you, then?

542
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:43,941
Obviously.

543
00:43:45,369 --> 00:43:48,278
Okay.

544
00:43:50,007 --> 00:43:51,375
Where's your shoes?

545
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:52,476
They're over here.

546
00:43:52,476 --> 00:43:53,710
Where's your room key?

547
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:54,847
It's in my bag.

548
00:43:55,412 --> 00:43:56,546
And where's your bag?

549
00:43:56,546 --> 00:43:57,786
It's right here.

550
00:43:58,281 --> 00:43:59,483
- Let's go.
- Wait!

551
00:43:59,483 --> 00:44:00,617
There's the elevator.
I gotta go.

552
00:44:00,617 --> 00:44:01,720
Hey!

553
00:44:05,155 --> 00:44:08,295
- Hi! How are you?
- Hi, Charlie!

554
00:44:10,694 --> 00:44:12,503
Bob, this is Charlie Brown.

555
00:44:12,896 --> 00:44:15,766
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

556
00:44:15,766 --> 00:44:17,401
- This is Bambie.
- How are you, Bambie?

557
00:44:17,401 --> 00:44:18,602
His real name's Hayashi, but ...

558
00:44:18,602 --> 00:44:20,170
Why do they call you
Charlie Brown?

559
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:23,006
Everybody say,
"He looks like Charlie Brown."

560
00:44:23,006 --> 00:44:24,474
You know, Snoopy, man.

561
00:44:24,474 --> 00:44:26,749
Oh, I'll be right back.

562
00:44:27,277 --> 00:44:31,281
Bob, over here. These are my friends.
Very beautiful.

563
00:44:31,281 --> 00:44:35,152
She's "B", and she's Rico,
and she's Myumi.

564
00:44:35,152 --> 00:44:37,621
- Myumi. How are you? I'm Bob.
- Oh! Bob.

565
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:39,956
Bob from United States, man.

566
00:44:41,158 --> 00:44:42,659
Hi, Bob.

567
00:44:42,659 --> 00:44:44,394
Maybe you'd like to
sing backup for me.

568
00:44:44,394 --> 00:44:45,829
This is my surfing teacher.

569
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:47,030
He's your surfing teacher?

570
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:50,033
- Sometime, sometime.
- You're a surfer?

571
00:45:26,837 --> 00:45:28,646
- The emperor's house? 
- Cool.

572
00:45:32,142 --> 00:45:33,746
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

573
00:45:37,547 --> 00:45:40,289
- Cool! Right.

574
00:45:40,417 --> 00:45:42,686
You don't have anything ...
Do you have anything ...

575
00:45:42,686 --> 00:45:45,122
- Hey.
- Hey. How you doing?

576
00:45:45,122 --> 00:45:46,189
Good. How are you?

577
00:45:46,189 --> 00:45:47,390
My Japanese is getting better.

578
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:49,292
We started speaking English.

579
00:45:55,632 --> 00:45:56,940
Charlie.

580
00:46:03,206 --> 00:46:05,108
Get out, guys!

581
00:46:05,108 --> 00:46:07,212
- BBs!
- They sting!

582
00:46:14,684 --> 00:46:16,319
Who are these guys, anyway?

583
00:46:22,893 --> 00:46:24,531
Hey, hey, hey!

584
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:27,667
Oh, no.

585
00:46:50,387 --> 00:46:51,524
Hi.

586
00:46:52,789 --> 00:46:54,233
Come on!

587
00:46:54,691 --> 00:46:56,726
Hey, guys! Over here!

588
00:46:56,726 --> 00:46:58,595
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!

589
00:46:58,595 --> 00:46:59,763
Wait! Our tour guide!

590
00:46:59,763 --> 00:47:00,969
Hurry up!

591
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:11,541
- Yeah?
- Gorgeous.

592
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:13,810
- Gorgeous?
- Blonde and black.

593
00:47:19,749 --> 00:47:21,318
Cheese. Cheese-o!

594
00:47:21,318 --> 00:47:22,489
Cheese!

595
00:47:24,321 --> 00:47:26,266
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hi.

596
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:29,659
- Hi, I'm Hans.
- Nice to meet you.

597
00:47:29,659 --> 00:47:31,695
- I'm Charlotte.
- Nice to meet you.

598
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:33,773
- Hi.
- Hi.

599
00:47:37,801 --> 00:47:41,238
- Last weekend, I went surfing.
- Right.

600
00:47:41,238 --> 00:47:44,875
About seven people, you know;
some of my friends.

601
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:48,745
And we camp over there on the beach.

602
00:47:50,146 --> 00:47:53,216
In fact, we made a kind of ...

603
00:47:53,216 --> 00:47:55,252
Wait. What kind of weed is it?

604
00:47:55,252 --> 00:47:56,753

~ Hello? ~

680
00:55:22,932 --> 00:55:24,001
Hey.

681
00:55:24,667 --> 00:55:26,202
~ Hello, Bob. ~

682
00:55:27,236 --> 00:55:29,772
Hey, you know, those carpet samples,

683
00:55:29,772 --> 00:55:31,407
you were right about the burgundy.

684
00:55:31,407 --> 00:55:33,176
It wasn't even close.

685
00:55:33,176 --> 00:55:34,777
Blows the others away.

686
00:55:34,777 --> 00:55:36,950
~ I'm glad you like it. ~

687
00:55:38,381 --> 00:55:42,590
I saw a great house tonight
that you would've loved,

688
00:55:43,052 --> 00:55:45,488
and that burgundy would've 
been good in this house, really.

689
00:55:45,488 --> 00:55:46,723
~ Really? ~

690
00:55:46,723 --> 00:55:49,325
A guy designed his
own house and built it.

691
00:55:49,325 --> 00:55:51,771
~ Oh, yeah? I wish I'd seen it. ~ 

692
00:55:53,696 --> 00:55:57,075
He's a fashion guy.
All these fashion people were there.

693
00:55:57,934 --> 00:56:01,104
And there were 
Japanese surfers there,

694
00:56:01,104 --> 00:56:05,942
and the guy was playing
really, really, really great music.

695
00:56:05,942 --> 00:56:08,378
I should've found out
what it was and brought some ...

696
00:56:08,378 --> 00:56:10,880
I'll bring some back.
I'll try to find out.

697
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,249
~ That sounds great.
Can you hold on? ~

698
00:56:15,685 --> 00:56:19,489
~ You have to have something for 
breakfast. Do you want some cereal? ~ 

699
00:56:19,489 --> 00:56:21,424
Tell her I said
she's gotta eat something.

700
00:56:21,424 --> 00:56:23,793
~ I'm just trying to get her
to eat something. ~

701
00:56:23,793 --> 00:56:26,429
Yeah. Tell her I said
she has to eat something.

702
00:56:26,429 --> 00:56:29,432
~ Your dad says eat something.
- No. ~ 

703
00:56:29,432 --> 00:56:31,667
Eat. Tell her I said so.

704
00:56:31,667 --> 00:56:33,908
~ She won't eat anything.
Forget it. ~

705
00:56:34,404 --> 00:56:36,508
~ Look, I'm glad you're having fun. ~

706
00:56:37,607 --> 00:56:41,020
It's not fun. It's just ...
It's just very, very different.

707
00:56:41,544 --> 00:56:43,148
~ Maybe that's good. ~

708
00:56:44,447 --> 00:56:47,049
~ I have to get the kids off
for school, okay? ~

709
00:56:47,049 --> 00:56:48,994
~ So, can I call you in a while? ~

710
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:53,390
I might not be up.
It's ... it's, like, 4:00.

711
00:56:54,757 --> 00:56:57,860
~ Well, you better get some sleep.
You have work in the morning. ~

712
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:00,272
No, actually,
they gave me tomorrow off.

713
00:57:00,997 --> 00:57:02,840
~ That must be nice. ~

714
00:57:05,902 --> 00:57:08,814
~ All right. Well, thanks
for checking in. I gotta go. ~

715
00:57:09,205 --> 00:57:11,774
- All right. Have a great, great night.
~ All right. ~

716
00:57:11,774 --> 00:57:14,277
I mean, I guess have
a great morning, huh?

717
00:57:14,944 --> 00:57:16,546
~ Good night, Bob. Good night. ~

718
00:57:16,546 --> 00:57:17,649
Good night.

719
00:57:19,816 --> 00:57:21,022
I love you.

720
00:57:23,686 --> 00:57:25,392
That was a stupid idea.

721
00:58:37,793 --> 00:58:39,362
- I was feeling tight, you know?
- Mmm-hmm.

722
00:58:39,362 --> 00:58:41,205
- Shoulders and neck.
- Mmm-hmm.

723
00:58:41,364 --> 00:58:43,969
So I called down and had a ...

724
00:58:45,201 --> 00:58:46,702
shiatsu massage in my room.

725
00:58:46,702 --> 00:58:48,004
That's nice.

726
00:58:48,004 --> 00:58:51,246
And the tightness has
completely disappeared ...

727
00:58:51,641 --> 00:58:53,484
and been replaced by ...

728
00:58:54,677 --> 00:58:56,315
unbelievable pain.

729
00:58:57,179 --> 00:58:59,448
Just staggering, unbearable pain.

730
00:58:59,448 --> 00:59:00,783
That's too bad.

731
00:59:00,783 --> 00:59:02,318
- Yeah. 
- I'm in pain.

732
00:59:02,318 --> 00:59:07,130
I got my foot banged up, and ...
Wanna see it?

733
00:59:08,157 --> 00:59:09,859
How do you say "No"?

734
00:59:09,859 --> 00:59:12,161
- Oh, my gosh!
- I know.

735
00:59:12,161 --> 00:59:13,162
That's ...

736
00:59:13,429 --> 00:59:14,730
How ... when did you do this?

737
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:17,166
I did it the other day.
It hurts, you know?

738
00:59:17,166 --> 00:59:19,035
Didn't you feel any pain? Your ...

739
00:59:19,035 --> 00:59:20,736
Yeah, it really hurt.
It was ...

740
00:59:20,736 --> 00:59:22,672
Yeah. That toe is almost dead.

741
00:59:23,806 --> 00:59:25,274
I think I gotta take you
to a doctor.

742
00:59:25,274 --> 00:59:27,476
You can't just put that
back in the shoe.

743
00:59:27,476 --> 00:59:29,245
No. I don't think so.

744
00:59:29,245 --> 00:59:31,847
Well, you either go to a doctor,
or you leave it here.

745
00:59:34,350 --> 00:59:36,454
He's smiling.
You like that idea?

746
00:59:36,752 --> 00:59:39,322
See, they love black toe
over in this country.

747
00:59:39,322 --> 00:59:41,233
You got a sharp knife?

748
00:59:41,524 --> 00:59:43,392
Gotta be, you know,
in this country,

749
00:59:43,392 --> 00:59:45,194
somebody's gotta 
prefer a black toe.

750
00:59:46,495 --> 00:59:47,863
"Brack toe."

751
00:59:47,863 --> 00:59:51,105
Or we should probably hang around 
until someone orders it.

752
00:59:51,701 --> 00:59:53,202
Hey, what's with the straight face?

753
00:59:53,769 --> 00:59:55,471
Hospital regulations.
Get in there.

754
00:59:55,471 --> 00:59:57,575
- All right. Thank you.
- All right.

755
01:00:00,776 --> 01:00:03,347
Careful, okay? No, don't!

756
01:00:03,879 --> 01:00:05,915
- No!
- Hey, use the horn, fella.

757
01:00:11,887 --> 01:00:13,696
Let's try "Mixed Internal".

758
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:16,436
Yeah. Go.
Switched to beer, huh?

759
01:00:16,993 --> 01:00:18,794
Go. Go.
You might want to switch to sake.

760
01:00:18,794 --> 01:00:20,068
Stop.

761
01:00:23,132 --> 01:00:24,201
Hi.

762
01:00:24,834 --> 01:00:25,968
- Hi.
- Hi.

763
01:00:27,103 --> 01:00:29,472
Yeah. We need a doctor.

764
01:00:29,472 --> 01:00:31,774
For a hurt ... Emergency room.

765
01:00:31,774 --> 01:00:34,584
It's not an emergency.
I just hurt my foot.

766
01:00:41,584 --> 01:00:44,654
Okay, do we fill this out?
We go over there?

767
01:00:44,654 --> 01:00:46,064
Which number?

768
01:00:52,495 --> 01:00:55,331
We're not going to another hospital, 
so whatever you say is okay.

769
01:00:55,331 --> 01:00:56,502
Okay.

770
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,641
Could you put that back
in the garage for us?

771
01:01:34,203 --> 01:01:35,545
"In desuka"?

772
01:01:46,248 --> 01:01:49,454
Japan.

773
01:01:52,088 --> 01:01:53,089
Japan ...

774
01:01:53,989 --> 01:01:54,990
After?

775
01:01:56,058 --> 01:01:57,093
Japan ...

776
01:02:07,336 --> 01:02:11,249
Ahh-ah, so. Ahh-ah.

777
01:02:12,274 --> 01:02:21,358
Ahh, so. Ahh ...

778
01:02:22,885 --> 01:02:24,159
How's that song go?

779
01:02:36,966 --> 01:02:38,342
Is that for me?

780
01:02:39,568 --> 01:02:40,978
Yeah, it can be for you.

781
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:16,472
Hey, Bob, it's Charlotte.

782
01:03:16,472 --> 01:03:20,910
I'm going to meet Charlie and those guys 
at this place called Orange around 10:00,

783
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:23,746

784
01:03:23,746 --> 01:03:26,158
I hope you can come

01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,466
They've got room to run.

809
01:04:46,762 --> 01:04:49,231
He's cutting back. He cut back.

810
01:04:49,231 --> 01:04:51,711
He's dancing. He's dancing.
Where'd he go?

811
01:04:54,970 --> 01:04:56,210
There you are.

812
01:04:59,475 --> 01:05:00,646
Say "Hi".

813
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:06,725
Hi. You ready?

814
01:05:07,883 --> 01:05:09,089
Come on.

815
01:05:11,754 --> 01:05:13,689
Thank you, Tokyo!

~ No, no. Not here. ~

826
01:07:29,892 --> 01:07:31,371
~ It must be over there. ~

827
01:07:47,309 --> 01:07:48,777
You know, 
the first time I saw you,

828
01:07:48,777 --> 01:07:51,280
you were wearing 
a tuxedo at the bar.

829
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,084
You were very dashing.

830
01:07:53,615 --> 01:07:55,116
I liked the mascara.

831
01:08:01,623 --> 01:08:04,293
But the first time I saw you
was in the elevator.

832
01:08:04,293 --> 01:08:05,461
Really?

833
01:08:05,461 --> 01:08:06,530
You don't remember?

834
01:08:10,065 --> 01:08:12,340
I guess you do
kind of blend in, huh?

835
01:08:14,703 --> 01:08:16,238
Did I scowl at you?

836
01:08:17,206 --> 01:08:18,807
No, you smiled.

837
01:08:18,807 --> 01:08:19,908
I did?

838
01:08:19,908 --> 01:08:21,643
Yes, it was a complete accident.

839
01:08:21,643 --> 01:08:23,278
A freak. I haven't seen it since.

840
01:08:23,278 --> 01:08:26,088
Just that one time.
Like that, but bigger.

841
01:08:27,749 --> 01:08:30,354
Bigger. Yeah, big, big ...

842
01:08:30,619 --> 01:08:32,098
Well, not that big.

843
01:08:33,455 --> 01:08:35,229
~ My goodness. ~

844
01:08:41,964 --> 01:08:45,639
~ Marcello, come here. Hurry up. ~

845
01:08:49,505 --> 01:08:52,144
Why do they switch the "R's" and
the "L's" here?

846
01:08:53,275 --> 01:08:55,778
Oh, for yuks.
You know, just to mix it up.

847
01:08:57,346 --> 01:09:00,282
They have to amuse themselves,
'cause we're not making them laugh.

848
01:09:03,852 --> 01:09:07,959
Let's never come here again,
'cause it would never be as much fun.

849
01:09:10,826 --> 01:09:13,101
Whatever you say. You're the boss.

850
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,874
I'm stuck.

851
01:09:23,672 --> 01:09:25,151
Does it get easier?

852
01:09:25,841 --> 01:09:26,910
No.

853
01:09:29,044 --> 01:09:30,284
Yes.

854
01:09:31,346 --> 01:09:32,654
It gets easier.

855
01:09:33,749 --> 01:09:34,989
Oh, yeah?

856
01:09:35,517 --> 01:09:36,791
Look at you.

857
01:09:38,587 --> 01:09:39,895
Thanks.

858
01:09:42,024 --> 01:09:44,293
The more you know who you are,

859
01:09:44,293 --> 01:09:45,863
and what you want,

860
01:09:46,562 --> 01:09:48,666
the less you let ...

861
01:09:49,464 --> 01:09:50,840
things upset you.

862
01:09:52,634 --> 01:09:53,874
Yeah.

863
01:09:55,671 --> 01:09:58,151
I just don't know
what I'm supposed to be.

864
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:00,048
You know?

865
01:10:01,343 --> 01:10:03,618
I tried being a writer, but ...

866
01:10:03,912 --> 01:10:05,380
I hate what I write.

867
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:09,259
And I tried taking pictures,

868
01:10:10,652 --> 01:10:12,688
but they're so mediocre, you know.

869
01:10:12,688 --> 01:10:15,828
Every girl goes through
a photography phase.

870
01:10:16,558 --> 01:10:18,162
You know, like horses?

871
01:10:19,161 --> 01:10:23,439
You know? 
Take dumb pictures of your feet.

872
01:10:25,801 --> 01:10:27,439
You'll figure that out.

873
01:10:29,004 --> 01:10:30,744
I'm not worried about you.

874
01:10:34,309 --> 01:10:35,549
Keep writing.

875
01:10:40,916 --> 01:10:42,554
But I'm so mean.

876
01:10:44,519 --> 01:10:46,362
- Mean's okay.
- Yeah?

877
01:10:53,528 --> 01:10:56,008
What about marriage?
Does that get easier?

878
01:11:03,205 --> 01:11:04,479
That's hard.

879
01:11:10,412 --> 01:11:12,323
We used to have a lot of fun.

880
01:11:13,882 --> 01:11:17,185
Lydia would come with me
when I made the movies,

881
01:11:17,185 --> 01:11:19,858
and we would laugh about it all.

882
01:11:22,057 --> 01:11:25,595
Now she doesn't want to leave 
the kids, and she doesn't ...

883
01:11:27,663 --> 01:11:30,866
need me to be there.

884
01:11:30,866 --> 01:11:34,074
The kids miss me, but they're fine.

885
01:11:36,738 --> 01:11:40,583
It gets a whole lot more complicated
when you have kids.

886
01:11:41,009 --> 01:11:42,783
Yeah. It's scary.

887
01:11:46,481 --> 01:11:48,317
It's the most terrifying
day of your life ...

888
01:11:48,317 --> 01:11:50,421
the day the first one is born.

889
01:11:51,053 --> 01:11:53,590
Yeah. Nobody ever tells you that.

890
01:11:54,856 --> 01:11:56,335
Your life,

891
01:11:57,392 --> 01:11:58,700
as you know it,

892
01:11:59,161 --> 01:12:00,503
is gone.

893
01:12:01,963 --> 01:12:03,339
Never to return.

894
01:12:06,001 --> 01:12:09,414
But they learn how to walk, and 
they learn how to talk, and ...

895
01:12:10,339 --> 01:12:13,285
And you want to be with them.

896
01:12:14,343 --> 01:12:16,845
And they turn out to be the most ...

897
01:12:16,845 --> 01:12:19,147
delightful people ...

898
01:12:19,147 --> 01:12:21,116
you will ever meet in your life.

899
01:12:21,116 --> 01:12:22,993
Hmm, that's nice.

900
01:12:37,299 --> 01:12:38,800
Where'd you grow up?

901
01:12:40,235 --> 01:12:41,839
I grew up in New York,

902
01:12:42,804 --> 01:12:46,149
and I moved to Los Angeles
when John and I got married.

903
01:12:47,209 --> 01:12:49,052
But it's so different there.

904
01:12:49,678 --> 01:12:51,384
Yeah, I know.

905
01:12:53,682 --> 01:12:55,889
John thinks I'm so snotty.

906
01:13:16,438 --> 01:13:17,973
You're not hopeless.

907
01:16:43,712 --> 01:16:44,815
Hello?

908
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:47,892
~ Mr. Harris? ~
- Yes.
~ A fax for you. ~

909
01:16:48,016 --> 01:16:50,452
Okay. Can you send it up?

910
01:16:50,452 --> 01:16:52,053
Do you think you could
kick it under the door for me,

911
01:16:52,053 --> 01:16:53,955
slide it under the door
for me, please?

912
01:16:53,955 --> 01:16:55,624
~ Do you want I send it
to your room? ~

913
01:16:55,624 --> 01:16:58,093
Just slide it under the door,
please. Thank you.

914
01:16:58,093 --> 01:17:00,402
~ Thank you, Mr. Harris. ~
- Okay. All right, bye.

915
01:17:35,764 --> 01:17:39,006
Hey, Ms. Kawasaki. 
It's Bob Harris.

916
01:17:39,801 --> 01:17:43,248
Yes, I would love to
do his talk show.

917
01:17:43,438 --> 01:17:44,609
I would.

918
01:17:45,940 --> 01:17:47,851
I would love to change
my plans and stay.

919
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:07,700
... American movie star ...

920
01:18:14,469 --> 01:18:16,671
Ladies and gentlemen,

921
01:18:16,671 --> 01:18:19,941
Mr. Bob Harris!

922
01:18:19,941 --> 01:18:23,211
Come on! 
Da de da de, da de da dah.

923
01:18:23,211 --> 01:18:27,181
Da de da dah! Whoo!

924
01:18:27,315 --> 01:18:29,150
Come on, Bob.
Come on, Bob.

925
01:18:29,150 --> 01:18:31,527
Bobby, come on!
Bobby, come on!

926
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,456
Nice to meet you.

927
01:18:38,293 --> 01:18:40,705
He said you guys
are e-mailing together.

928
01:18:47,969 --> 01:18:49,871
He wants to show you his dance.

929
01:18:49,871 --> 01:18:52,373
Japanese dance step.
Japanese dance.

930
01:18:52,373 --> 01:18:54,075
Do I ... Do I have
to dance with him?

931
01:18:54,075 --> 01:18:59,180
To-tung a-tung.
To-tung a-tung.

932
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:02,217
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby,
Bobby ... Bobby.

933
01:19:03,585 --> 01:19:05,053
- Welcome, Bob.
- What?

934
01:19:05,053 --> 01:19:06,463
He was saying, "Welcome, Bob."

935
01:19:46,294 --> 01:19:48,239
- Hello?
~ Bob? ~

936
01:19:50,431 --> 01:19:51,602
Hi, Lydia.

937
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:53,504
~ Is this a bad time? ~

938
01:19:54,536 --> 01:19:56,379
No, it's always a good time.

939
01:19:56,938 --> 01:20:00,275
~ Look, your burgundy carpet
isn't in stock. ~

940
01:20:00,275 --> 01:20:03,745
~ It's gonna take 12 weeks. Did you 
like any of the other colors? ~

941
01:20:07,582 --> 01:20:10,324
Whatever you like.
I'm completely lost.

942
01:20:11,619 --> 01:20:13,291
~ It's just carpet. ~

943
01:20:14,455 --> 01:20:16,157
That's not what I'm talking about.

944
01:20:16,157 --> 01:20:17,966
~ What are you talking about? ~

945
01:20:20,762 --> 01:20:23,298
I don't know.
I just want to get healthy.

946
01:20:23,298 --> 01:20:26,005
You know, I want to take
better care of myself.

947
01:20:26,401 --> 01:20:29,404
I would like to start
eating healthier.

948
01:20:29,571 --> 01:20:31,414
I don't want all that pasta.

949
01:20:31,873 --> 01:20:33,044
~ What? ~

950
01:20:33,541 --> 01:20:36,385
I would like to start eating,
like, Japanese food.

951
01:20:37,745 --> 01:20:41,420
~ Well, why don't you just stay there,
and you can have it every day? ~

952
01:20:46,321 --> 01:20:48,061
How are the kids doing?

953
01:20:49,057 --> 01:20:51,696
~ They're fine.
They miss their father. ~

954
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:54,567
~ But they're getting used
to you not being here. ~

955
01:20:54,963 --> 01:20:57,102
~ Do I need to worry
about you, Bob? ~

956
01:20:58,967 --> 01:21:00,605
Only if you want to.

957
01:21:02,370 --> 01:21:06,283
~ Bob, I got things to do.
I gotta go. ~

958
01:21:06,975 --> 01:21:08,112
Okay.

959
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:11,613
~ I'll see you ... I mean,
I'll talk to you later. ~

960
01:21:11,613 --> 01:21:12,921
Okay.

961
01:21:13,448 --> 01:21:14,927
~ Okay, bye. ~

962
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:16,690
Bye.

963
01:21:55,957 --> 01:21:59,734
We have Matthew Smellick!

964
01:22:00,161 --> 01:22:03,039
Matthew Snellick.

965
01:22:10,371 --> 01:22:11,940
Thank you. Thank you so much.

966
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:13,141
We'll take a really short break,

967
01:22:13,141 --> 01:22:14,676
and we'll see you in a minute.

968
01:22:21,649 --> 01:22:23,992
Hi. Champagne. Thanks.

969
01:22:30,591 --> 01:22:31,762

growing up in the '50s.

1004
01:24:44,826 --> 01:24:47,361

I guess, goodbye and enjoy
