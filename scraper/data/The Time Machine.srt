1
00:02:29,498 --> 00:02:31,333
Excuse me, Mr. Filby!

2
00:03:39,943 --> 00:03:41,362
I say...

3
00:03:44,907 --> 00:03:49,995
- I say, it's outright rude of the man!
- He's merely being detained, that's all.

4
00:03:50,204 --> 00:03:52,247
This is such a confounded waste of time!

5
00:03:52,456 --> 00:03:56,210
If he's not coming, I have any
number of more important things to do.

6
00:04:00,547 --> 00:04:03,133
Well, speak up. What is it, woman?

7
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:16,313
Well, are we or are we
not invited for dinner?

8
00:04:17,147 --> 00:04:18,524
Apparently, we are.

9
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:24,196
- How long has he been gone?
- Well, I can't rightly say, sir. Several days.

10
00:04:24,404 --> 00:04:26,698
I've hardly seen him for some time.

11
00:04:26,907 --> 00:04:31,328
And he never leaves the laboratory.
He only comes in and picks at his food.

12
00:04:32,121 --> 00:04:36,542
But he did tell me about dinner tonight,
sir, and left those instructions.

13
00:04:38,877 --> 00:04:40,921
Thank you, Mrs. Watchett.

14
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:46,051
- Well, what does it say, Filby? What's wrong?
- Oh, nothing, really.

15
00:04:46,426 --> 00:04:51,223
George merely says that if he's not here by
8 o'clock, then we're to begin without him.

16
00:04:53,225 --> 00:04:55,060
Walter, what time is it?

17
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,983
Dinner is served, gentlemen.

18
00:05:01,191 --> 00:05:04,528
First sensible thing
I've heard all evening.

19
00:05:05,612 --> 00:05:09,700
This is peculiar. He's usually
most prompt, precise and punctual.

20
00:05:09,908 --> 00:05:12,118
He's making fools of us by
inviting us here and then

21
00:05:12,153 --> 00:05:14,329
not showing up. It's not
the behaviour of a gentleman.

22
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,667
- To say nothing of a waste of time.
- Yes. To say nothing of a waste of time.

23
00:05:18,876 --> 00:05:22,796
It's one thing I like about our George: he's
got the best cellar in the southern England.

24
00:05:23,046 --> 00:05:26,383
And Mrs. Watchett is the
finest cook in the world.

25
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:29,386
Yes, I think I'll drink to that.

26
00:05:44,026 --> 00:05:47,362
- Good Lord! What's happened?
- I'm all right.

27
00:05:49,823 --> 00:05:51,491
Some food.

28
00:05:53,911 --> 00:05:55,329
A drink.

29
00:06:06,798 --> 00:06:10,135
- I didn't recognize you.
- Mrs. Watchett.

30
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:19,811
Well, can't you speak,
man? What happened to you?

31
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,855
- Leave him alone, can't yo?.
- It's all right.

32
00:06:22,064 --> 00:06:25,025
- I've got to tell it now,
David, while I still remember it.

33
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,735
Relax. Try to relax.

34
00:06:27,194 --> 00:06:30,280
You've all the time in the world.

35
00:06:32,532 --> 00:06:34,368
You're right, David.

36
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:38,038
That's exactly what I have.

37
00:06:39,706 --> 00:06:41,792
All the time in the world.

38
00:06:43,877 --> 00:06:46,296
Ever since we were
together five days ago,..

39
00:06:46,713 --> 00:06:48,673
...the last day of 1899.

40
00:06:53,136 --> 00:06:56,932
There in that box rests the
result of two years' labor.

41
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,855
I wanted to finish the job
before the new century began.

42
00:07:04,606 --> 00:07:06,358
I barely made it.

43
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,071
- Cheers, gentlemen.
- Marvelous, old boy.

44
00:07:11,655 --> 00:07:13,657
Yes, but what is it?

45
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:17,869
Well, it has to do with time.

46
00:07:19,121 --> 00:07:22,124
Oh, I've always maintained
that what this nation needs...

47
00:07:22,332 --> 00:07:24,501
...is a reliable timepiece.

48
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,253
The navy needs one.

49
00:07:26,461 --> 00:07:29,297
The army needs one for
the artillery, you know.

50
00:07:29,673 --> 00:07:34,094
You couldn't do better, George. So
that's why you've been in hiding, huh?

51
00:07:34,678 --> 00:07:36,805
That's very clever of you, indeed.

52
00:07:37,097 --> 00:07:40,809
I don't think George is referring
to a new type of timepiece.

53
00:07:42,102 --> 00:07:43,728
No, David.

54
00:07:45,272 --> 00:07:49,526
When I speak of time, gentlemen, I'm
referring to the fourth dimension.

55
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:53,530
Go on, George.

56
00:07:55,157 --> 00:07:58,785
Well, the difficulty in explaining the fourth
dimension is that it cannot be seen or felt.

57
00:07:59,786 --> 00:08:05,208
If you don't mind, George, would you
refresh me on the first three dimensions?

58
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:09,588
Really, Filby. Surely they
taught you something at school.

59
00:08:09,796 --> 00:08:12,090
Suppose you explain it, doctor.

60
00:08:13,425 --> 00:08:14,801
Certainly.

61
00:08:18,305 --> 00:08:22,350
For example, when I move in a
straight line, forward or backward...

62
00:08:22,726 --> 00:08:24,269
...that's one dimension.

63
00:08:24,477 --> 00:08:27,814
And when I move to the left or right
- two dimensions.

64
00:08:28,064 --> 00:08:29,983
And when I move up or down

65
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:32,193
...three dimensions.

66
00:08:34,195 --> 00:08:36,156
For instance, that box.

67
00:08:37,574 --> 00:08:41,578
Well, that box has three dimensions:
length, breadth and height.

68
00:08:42,078 --> 00:08:44,164
Yes, but what is the fourth dimension?

69
00:08:45,332 --> 00:08:47,132
That's mere theory. No one really knows

70
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:49,753
what the fourth dimension
is or even that it exists.

71
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:51,379
On the contrary, Doctor.

72
00:08:51,796 --> 00:08:56,009
The fourth dimension is as real and true
a dimension as any of the other three.

73
00:08:56,217 --> 00:08:58,929
In fact, they couldn't exist without it.

74
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:00,221
What do you mean?

75
00:09:01,723 --> 00:09:03,391
Let's take that box.

76
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:06,686
It has the first three
dimensions, as you said.

77
00:09:07,103 --> 00:09:09,397
- All right. But what's in that box?
- I'm coming to that.

78
00:09:09,606 --> 00:09:11,399
Let's consider this first.

79
00:09:11,608 --> 00:09:14,277
Why is it that we usually
ignore the fourth dimension?

80
00:09:14,312 --> 00:09:16,696
Because we have no freedom
of movement within it.

81
00:09:16,905 --> 00:09:18,788
You see, we can move in the other three:

82
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:21,785
up, down, forward, sideways,
backward, as the Doctor said.

83
00:09:21,993 --> 00:09:24,996
But when it comes to
time, we are prisoners.

84
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,336
Do you follow me, Bridey?

85
00:09:31,711 --> 00:09:33,004
No.

86
00:09:36,007 --> 00:09:40,762
George, you've given the most lucid explanation
of all, but I'm afraid I don't quite understand.

87
00:09:41,262 --> 00:09:44,599
Walter, look, there are many things in this
world you don't understand, aren't there?

88
00:09:44,808 --> 00:09:46,142
Yes, quite... quite a number.

89
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:49,145
Well, you don't refuse to believe
in them because of that, do you?

90
00:09:49,354 --> 00:09:52,273
- No, not if I can see
the proof with my own eyes.

91
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:53,608
Good, Walter.

92
00:09:54,401 --> 00:09:56,861
Gentlemen, all I'm
asking you to do now...

93
00:09:57,654 --> 00:10:00,824
...is to witness a demonstration
of the possibility of movement...

94
00:10:01,032 --> 00:10:03,368
...within the fourth dimension.

95
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,710
- Doctor, can I have your help?
- Oh, certainly, certainly.

96
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:38,486
It's beautiful!

97
00:10:39,154 --> 00:10:41,322
- It's remarkable.
- Very nice, George.

98
00:10:42,824 --> 00:10:43,992
Fascinating.

99
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:45,785
What is it?

100
00:10:46,244 --> 00:10:48,538
This is only a small
experimental model, of course.

101
00:10:51,207 --> 00:10:55,712
- To carry a man, a larger edition is needed.
- To carry a man? Where?

102
00:10:56,504 --> 00:10:58,798
Into the past or into the future.

103
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:01,926
This is a time machine.

104
00:11:02,552 --> 00:11:04,762
All right, George, now
you've had your little joke.

105
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,973
Suppose you tell us what
this contraption's really for.

106
00:11:07,182 --> 00:11:09,058
I've already told you, Doctor.

107
00:11:09,475 --> 00:11:13,104
The larger model can be used to carry
a passenger on a journey through time.

108
00:11:13,313 --> 00:11:15,815
Not through space, mind
you, but through time.

109
00:11:16,024 --> 00:11:18,234
I say, George, if you're gonna
start floating about in the future,

110
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:20,153
how'd you gonna rather mess
things up for the rest of us?

111
00:11:20,486 --> 00:11:23,907
Well, the future's already there.
It's irrevocable and cannot be changed.

112
00:11:26,492 --> 00:11:27,660
I wonder.

113
00:11:29,746 --> 00:11:33,499
Now, that's the most important question
to which I hope to find an answer.

114
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:39,839
Can man control his destiny? Can he
change the shape of things to come?

115
00:11:40,173 --> 00:11:43,092
Now, look here, George, if you've
gone out of your head, I forgive you.

116
00:11:43,301 --> 00:11:48,473
- But if you've made us waste all this time,..
- No, Doctor! You're here as witnesses.

117
00:11:49,057 --> 00:11:51,976
- To see, not to listen.
- To see? What?

118
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,396
The experiment I am about to perform.

119
00:11:56,356 --> 00:11:58,031
First, let me tell you how it works.

120
00:11:58,066 --> 00:12:01,778
Here, in this compartment, you see the
saddle, where the time traveller sits.

121
00:12:01,986 --> 00:12:03,780
And in front of him are the controls.

122
00:12:04,572 --> 00:12:08,576
Let's do this properly. You can
spare a cigar, I trust, Doctor?

123
00:12:12,288 --> 00:12:14,874
Now, let us imagine that this cigar...

124
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:17,627
...is the time traveller.

125
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,006
Now, in front of him is the
lever, which controls movement.

126
00:12:22,882 --> 00:12:25,885
Forward pressure sends the
machine into the future,..

127
00:12:26,219 --> 00:12:28,805
...backward pressure
- into the past.

128
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:32,934
And the harder the pressure,
the faster the machine travels.

129
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:36,688
Of course, our little experiment
can be performed only once.

130
00:12:37,563 --> 00:12:42,985
If it succeeds, I lose my model
forever. That's why I need witnesses.

131
00:12:44,821 --> 00:12:46,406
Go ahead, George.

132
00:12:47,407 --> 00:12:48,950
All ready, gentlemen?

133
00:12:55,873 --> 00:12:57,875
Doctor, would you
here lend me your hand?

134
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,302
I'll be damned!

135
00:13:49,677 --> 00:13:51,179
It worked.

136
00:13:52,346 --> 00:13:55,516
- But where did it go?
- Go?

137
00:13:55,725 --> 00:13:58,269
Nowhere, in the usual
sense. It's still here.

138
00:13:59,937 --> 00:14:02,440
But it's no longer in the present.

139
00:14:03,232 --> 00:14:07,195
Do you realise? It's travelling through
time. To the future, to be exact.

140
00:14:07,403 --> 00:14:09,864
Do you really expect us
to believe such a story?

141
00:14:11,115 --> 00:14:12,074
Well, you've just... Certainly.

142
00:14:12,283 --> 00:14:14,869
- But you yourself just said
that it hadn't really moved.

143
00:14:14,904 --> 00:14:15,661
That's correct.

144
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,872
Well, then why can't we see it?

145
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,334
Because we're in this room on
the 31st of December, 1899...

146
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:25,129
...but the model we just saw is
perhaps a hundred years away by now.

147
00:14:25,338 --> 00:14:28,716
This room, even this whole house
may not be here in a hundred years.

148
00:14:28,925 --> 00:14:32,261
But the time machine occupies
the same space that it did...

149
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,472
...a moment before it
went off on its journey.

150
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,351
Well, if it's occupying the
same space, why can't I feel it?

151
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,438
You must remember that the space you're
putting your hand through is today's space.

152
00:14:42,647 --> 00:14:45,775
You can't put your hand
into the space of tomorrow.

153
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,319
Space doesn't change!

154
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:52,031
The same space that's here now should be here
in a hundred or even a thousand years from now.

155
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,909
No, Philip, time changes space!

156
00:14:57,745 --> 00:15:00,665
Look, this flat ground we're
stading on could've been

157
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,167
at the bottom of the
sea a million years ago.

158
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:08,297
And a million years from now, it could
be the interior of a huge mountain.

159
00:15:08,506 --> 00:15:11,634
All right, suppose, what
you say is true, what do you

160
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:13,844
expect to do with such a contraption?

161
00:15:14,095 --> 00:15:16,013
Contraption?

162
00:15:16,973 --> 00:15:20,643
For my part, I intend taking
a journey into the future.

163
00:15:21,227 --> 00:15:24,230
Well, perhaps the doctor
would volunteer to go?

164
00:15:25,356 --> 00:15:26,983
Well, look here, George...

165
00:15:27,191 --> 00:15:30,653
...suppose you do and go off and get
lost in the 50th century or something.

166
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:34,824
- How you're gonna get back?
- That's a risk I'm prepared to take.

167
00:15:36,158 --> 00:15:38,661
Now, look here, George.

168
00:15:38,911 --> 00:15:41,914
I don't know what you think us
for, but we're not fools, you know!

169
00:15:42,123 --> 00:15:44,000
We're practical men, businessmen.

170
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,752
No, now, the question I
want to put you is this:

171
00:15:46,961 --> 00:15:51,173
Even if you had invented a time machine,
or what have you called it, what of it?

172
00:15:51,382 --> 00:15:53,384
What use would it be to anyone?
Who would want to buy it?

173
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,136
And how much would they
be willing to pay for it?

174
00:15:55,386 --> 00:15:58,639
Yes, George, have you thought
of the commercial possibilities?

175
00:16:00,433 --> 00:16:01,642
No, I really haven't.

176
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:06,272
George...! There's a war on,
you know, in South Africa.

177
00:16:06,647 --> 00:16:09,087
The Boers are putting
up a pretty stiff fight.

178
00:16:09,122 --> 00:16:11,527
Now, George, the country
needs inventors like you.

179
00:16:12,695 --> 00:16:15,823
I can put you in touch with
the War Office if you wish.

180
00:16:19,702 --> 00:16:21,495
What do you think, David?

181
00:16:23,998 --> 00:16:27,334
Oh, I think Dr. Hillyer
has a good point, George.

182
00:16:28,711 --> 00:16:30,546
Now, we're becoming more sensible.

183
00:16:30,755 --> 00:16:32,923
I'll see to it first
thing in the new year.

184
00:16:33,132 --> 00:16:35,342
Good Lord! It's time to go, gentlemen.

185
00:16:35,551 --> 00:16:38,721
Yes, I'm sure we all have
our plans for tonight.

186
00:16:40,723 --> 00:16:44,769
- Are you all right, George?
- Yes, I'm all right, Bridey.

187
00:16:44,977 --> 00:16:46,520
Coming, Bridewell?

188
00:16:52,985 --> 00:16:54,236
Thank you for coming.

189
00:16:54,445 --> 00:16:56,530
- Good night, George.
- Happy New Year, George.

190
00:16:56,906 --> 00:17:00,159
- Happy new century, George.
- Good night, Bridey.

191
00:17:18,594 --> 00:17:21,931
Happy New Year!

192
00:18:38,048 --> 00:18:40,718
I thought I'd better stay.

193
00:18:50,227 --> 00:18:53,272
Well, You shouldn't have troubled
yourself, David. I'm all right.

194
00:18:53,814 --> 00:18:55,190
No, you're not.

195
00:18:55,983 --> 00:18:58,944
You've been behaving
oddly for over a month now.

196
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,073
I'm not leaving here until you
tell me what's on your mind.

197
00:19:03,282 --> 00:19:07,327
Look, David, I appreciate the gesture,
but I just wanna be left alone, that's all.

198
00:19:07,703 --> 00:19:10,622
You've changed, George. Enormously.

199
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,376
I'm sorry.

200
00:19:16,962 --> 00:19:19,798
Will you answer me
one question, honestly?

201
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:25,012
Yes, I'll try.

202
00:19:26,513 --> 00:19:29,600
Why this preoccupation with time?

203
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:32,186
Why not?

204
00:19:33,145 --> 00:19:34,980
Don't go simple on me, George.

205
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:42,154
All right, if you want to know the truth, I
don't much care for the time I was born into.

206
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,199
It seems people aren't
dying fast enough these days.

207
00:19:45,783 --> 00:19:47,493
They call upon science...

208
00:19:47,701 --> 00:19:51,914
...to invent new, more efficient
weapons to depopulate the Earth.

209
00:19:52,581 --> 00:19:54,166
And I agree with you.

210
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:58,754
I agree, George. But here we are
and we have to make the best of it.

211
00:19:58,962 --> 00:20:00,881
You may have to. I don't.

212
00:20:01,089 --> 00:20:04,635
All right. Take your
journey on your contraption.

213
00:20:04,843 --> 00:20:06,428
Who would you become?

214
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:09,348
A Greek? A Roman?

215
00:20:09,556 --> 00:20:12,226
- One of the pharaohs?
- I prefer the future.

216
00:20:14,228 --> 00:20:17,814
You're not seriously
saying you can do it?

217
00:20:18,357 --> 00:20:20,859
David, you saw the experiment
this afternoon, didn't you?

218
00:20:21,693 --> 00:20:24,571
I saw a toy machine vanish.

219
00:20:25,197 --> 00:20:29,368
I'm certain that there are any
number of ways of doing that trick.

220
00:20:29,576 --> 00:20:32,704
Any magician with a hippodrome
could probably do it.

221
00:20:33,372 --> 00:20:35,123
It wasn't a trick!

222
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:41,046
- Would you like to see the
full-scale model? - No, I would not.

223
00:20:41,255 --> 00:20:44,841
I have no desire to tempt
the laws of Providence.

224
00:20:45,384 --> 00:20:47,553
And I don't think you should.

225
00:20:48,637 --> 00:20:53,350
- It's not for man to trifle with.
- You carry on like Hillyer and Kemp now.

226
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,563
There is something to say about
their common-sense attitude to life.

227
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,857
George, I speak to you as a friend.

228
00:21:02,568 --> 00:21:05,737
More. As a brother.

229
00:21:06,655 --> 00:21:10,617
If that machine can do what
you say it can, destroy it.

230
00:21:11,451 --> 00:21:14,121
Destroy it, George,
before it destroys you!

231
00:21:15,664 --> 00:21:20,085
You must have plans for New Year's
Eve, David. Don't let me keep you.

232
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:27,301
Mary wasn't well. We thought
we'd stay home with the baby.

233
00:21:29,303 --> 00:21:34,308
Why don't you come home with me? You
haven't seen wee Jamey for a long time.

234
00:21:39,271 --> 00:21:41,023
I'm sorry, I can't, David.

235
00:21:41,982 --> 00:21:43,859
What's stopping you?

236
00:21:44,776 --> 00:21:50,073
Well... Look, I just want to see the
old century out by myself, that's all.

237
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:55,120
Have it your way, George.

238
00:22:02,753 --> 00:22:07,007
George, will you promise you'll
not go out of the house tonight?

239
00:22:10,635 --> 00:22:13,430
I promise you I won't walk out the door.

240
00:22:20,395 --> 00:22:24,274
Davy, I'm sorry. Please don't
think me unkind or unfriendly, I...

241
00:22:24,483 --> 00:22:26,902
- Look, just come over to
dinner next Friday, will you.

242
00:22:26,937 --> 00:22:27,486
Very well.

243
00:22:27,736 --> 00:22:31,823
- Fine. Bring the others with you.
- As you say, George.

244
00:22:33,075 --> 00:22:36,495
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year, David.

245
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:27,295
- Having supper in tonight, sir?
- I don't think so, Mrs. Watchett.

246
00:23:28,255 --> 00:23:30,590
Why don't you take the
evening off and celebrate?

247
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,058
Well, thank you, sir, but
if you're not need in me,

248
00:23:33,093 --> 00:23:35,637
I think I'll turn in earlier
and get some sleep,.. if I can.

249
00:23:36,012 --> 00:23:37,931
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

250
00:23:39,307 --> 00:23:43,937
Oh, Mrs. Watchett, I've invited Mr. Filby
and the others to dinner next Friday night.

251
00:23:43,979 --> 00:23:44,354
Oh, yes, sir.

252
00:23:44,396 --> 00:23:46,523
- Happy New Year, Mrs. Watchett.
- Happy New Year, sir.

253
00:26:13,253 --> 00:26:16,756
At first, I pushed the lever
forward ever so slightly...

254
00:26:18,675 --> 00:26:21,427
...and the laboratory
grew faint around me.

255
00:26:37,944 --> 00:26:39,445
I stopped.

256
00:26:44,117 --> 00:26:45,702
No change.

257
00:26:46,536 --> 00:26:48,872
Everything exactly
as it had been before.

258
00:26:49,956 --> 00:26:54,419
But no! The clock said 6:31 when
I started, and now it was... 8:09?

259
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:58,673
And the candle, shorter by inches!

260
00:27:02,051 --> 00:27:07,098
And yet by my watch, which was in the machine
with me, only a few seconds had passed.

261
00:27:25,992 --> 00:27:31,331
It was disconcerting to see the
sun arc in less than a minute.

262
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:35,043
To see a snail race by.

263
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:39,505
My flowers flinging wide their
petals to embrace the new day.

264
00:27:40,214 --> 00:27:43,217
And the hours speeding
across the face of my sundial.

265
00:27:44,093 --> 00:27:47,013
And the flowers closing
their eyes for the night.

266
00:27:47,555 --> 00:27:48,848
It was wonderful!

267
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:52,769
Changes that normally took
hours occuring in seconds.

268
00:27:56,647 --> 00:27:58,816
Dear Mrs. Watchett...

269
00:27:59,942 --> 00:28:01,819
...always able to tell
me what tie to wear...

270
00:28:02,028 --> 00:28:04,947
...but never able to decide to
wear anything more stylish...

271
00:28:05,198 --> 00:28:07,658
...than the type of clothes
she's worn all these years.

272
00:28:08,284 --> 00:28:10,953
And as yet I was traveling very slowly.

273
00:28:12,372 --> 00:28:14,290
What if I went faster?

274
00:28:42,026 --> 00:28:44,445
It became intoxicating.

275
00:28:45,238 --> 00:28:48,908
So I pushed the lever on
toward even greater speed.

276
00:28:56,666 --> 00:28:58,793
As I went along I gained
experience in handling the machine.

277
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,424
I found that I could stop for a day, an
hour, or even for a second to observe.

278
00:29:08,553 --> 00:29:10,972
Then go ahead a year or two.

279
00:29:11,472 --> 00:29:16,227
Thus, I was able to see the changing
world in a series of glimpses.

280
00:29:20,273 --> 00:29:23,317
Good heavens. That's a dress?

281
00:29:26,404 --> 00:29:28,322
This was intriguing.

282
00:29:29,073 --> 00:29:32,869
I wondered just how far women
would permit this to go.

283
00:29:51,304 --> 00:29:54,265
I began to grow very
fond of that mannequin.

284
00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:57,977
Maybe because, like me, she didn't age.

285
00:30:11,908 --> 00:30:17,204
Thirteen years have passed.
Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen...

286
00:30:20,124 --> 00:30:23,294
and then suddenly the light
was gone. What had happened?

287
00:30:24,754 --> 00:30:28,633
In the year of 1917, I stopped.

288
00:33:10,502 --> 00:33:11,879
Filby!

289
00:33:12,922 --> 00:33:15,716
Well, what are you doing?
Are you in a masquerade party?

290
00:33:19,219 --> 00:33:22,264
You look rather silly without
your mustache, old man.

291
00:33:22,473 --> 00:33:25,476
- Were you addressing me, sir?
- Filby, it's George!

292
00:33:25,684 --> 00:33:28,395
Well, I must say I expected a little
more enthusiastic a greeting...

293
00:33:28,604 --> 00:33:31,065
I think you're confusing
me with my father, sir.

294
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:35,903
Yes, there was quite a
resemblance. I'm James Filby.

295
00:33:36,987 --> 00:33:38,489
"Was"?

296
00:33:40,366 --> 00:33:43,077
- Were you a friend of Father's?
- Yes.

297
00:33:43,577 --> 00:33:45,162
Yes, I've been away.

298
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,750
He was killed in the war. A year ago.

299
00:33:56,382 --> 00:33:58,217
Oh, I'm so sorry.

300
00:34:00,803 --> 00:34:05,516
- What about the gentleman across the street?
- Oh, him, the inventor chap?

301
00:34:06,308 --> 00:34:09,561
He disappeared around
the turn of the century.

302
00:34:09,853 --> 00:34:13,774
Look, here, if you're interested in that
house, sir, I'm afraid you can't buy it.

303
00:34:14,316 --> 00:34:16,902
- Can't even get inside.
- Why is that?

304
00:34:17,403 --> 00:34:22,825
Well, my father was executor of the inventor's
estate and father just refused to liquidate it.

305
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:25,828
I often chided him on that account...

306
00:34:25,994 --> 00:34:29,331
...but he felt positive the
owner would return some day.

307
00:34:29,581 --> 00:34:32,418
People hereabouts think
it's haunted, but...

308
00:34:35,254 --> 00:34:36,588
Who are you, sir?

309
00:34:39,341 --> 00:34:42,344
Just a stranger who
once knew your father.

310
00:34:43,846 --> 00:34:46,181
Have you been at the front?

311
00:34:47,307 --> 00:34:49,143
Front? What front?

312
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:52,396
What the... the war, of course.

313
00:34:53,021 --> 00:34:54,648
What war?

314
00:34:55,357 --> 00:34:56,775
Good heavens!

315
00:34:57,734 --> 00:35:01,947
You mean you don't know we've been
at war with Germany since 1914?

316
00:35:02,322 --> 00:35:05,200
I thought you'd just
returned from France perhaps.

317
00:35:05,409 --> 00:35:06,326
Or perhaps...

318
00:35:08,287 --> 00:35:11,248
...perhaps a cup of tea might
make you feel better, sir?

319
00:35:11,957 --> 00:35:13,625
Won't you come in?

320
00:35:15,419 --> 00:35:16,837
No, no, thank you.

321
00:35:19,047 --> 00:35:21,675
Are you sure you're all right, sir?

322
00:35:23,552 --> 00:35:25,554
Yes, I'm quite all right.

323
00:35:26,555 --> 00:35:29,391
Then goodbye, sir.

324
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,938
Goodbye, Jamey.

325
00:37:11,785 --> 00:37:15,247
Suddenly, in 1940, I began to
be buffeted from side to side.

326
00:37:15,455 --> 00:37:19,126
My first thought was that the machine had a
mechanical defect or if a quark had worn out.

327
00:37:37,394 --> 00:37:41,857
The last time I had stopped
was in 1917, 23 years ago.

328
00:37:42,315 --> 00:37:47,362
And the war with Germany was still waging.
Now in the air with flying machines.

329
00:37:49,197 --> 00:37:53,535
Then I realized the truth of
the matter. This was a new war.

330
00:37:54,828 --> 00:37:58,707
I decided to push on into time
and see the outcome of this.

331
00:38:02,794 --> 00:38:04,045
Then my house was hit!

332
00:38:04,254 --> 00:38:07,632
The flames shot up into the sky.
And my home was gone in an instant.

333
00:38:07,841 --> 00:38:09,718
And I found myself in the open air.

334
00:38:18,977 --> 00:38:22,564
The years rolled by,
everything unfamiliar.

335
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:30,071
Except the smile of
my never-aging friend.

336
00:38:30,614 --> 00:38:34,618
But what was this? Weird sounds
all around me. What could it be?

337
00:38:35,035 --> 00:38:37,746
My curiosity compelled me to stop.

338
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,892
At first, I wondered if my machine
I was the cause of the panic.

339
00:39:02,562 --> 00:39:04,689
Well, I was soon to
find out that we weren't.

340
00:39:05,023 --> 00:39:07,150
Keep it moving here! Shove it on!

341
00:39:16,785 --> 00:39:18,703
Come on, into the shelter.

342
00:40:12,382 --> 00:40:14,467
Come on, young man! Come on! Come on!

343
00:40:15,885 --> 00:40:18,054
- Filby?
- The name is Mr. Filby.

344
00:40:18,263 --> 00:40:21,891
- And didn't you hear the air raid siren?
- You mean the horrible screeching?

345
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,853
It wasn't constructed for its
aesthetic value, young man...

346
00:40:25,061 --> 00:40:28,148
...but to warn silly young fools
like you to get into the shelter.

347
00:40:28,356 --> 00:40:31,693
- Now, come along, come along.
- But I'm perfectly comfortable here, Mr. Filby.

348
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:34,821
I've got to talk to
somebody. This is fantastic!

349
00:40:35,029 --> 00:40:38,032
Your store is magnificent!
The achievements!

350
00:40:38,241 --> 00:40:42,620
- The gigantic strides that man kinded!
- Come along, young man! Come along! Come along!

351
00:40:43,121 --> 00:40:45,665
You better hurry or the
mushrooms will be sprouting!

352
00:40:45,874 --> 00:40:47,083
Mushrooms?

353
00:40:51,212 --> 00:40:55,216
You look familiar. Haven't
we met somewhere before?

354
00:40:55,633 --> 00:41:00,096
Indeed we have, Mr. Filby.
Right there. Many years ago.

355
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,223
I was sure of that.

356
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,018
But the exact time escapes me.

357
00:41:06,936 --> 00:41:10,774
It was two wars ago. 1917.

358
00:41:11,524 --> 00:41:15,612
Now I recall. The chap who
inquired about my father...

359
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:19,741
...and the house that used
to stand across the way.

360
00:41:21,618 --> 00:41:25,872
But no... No, that's impossible!

361
00:41:26,289 --> 00:41:29,542
You haven't changed.
You're not a day older.

362
00:41:30,293 --> 00:41:31,878
And your clothes!

363
00:41:32,086 --> 00:41:36,007
Don't worry, Filby. It'll take
a little time to explain, but...

364
00:41:37,217 --> 00:41:40,553
That's the last alert! Hurry! Hurry!

365
00:41:40,845 --> 00:41:43,515
- Listen, this is important.
- Look!

366
00:41:45,266 --> 00:41:49,729
An atomic satellite,
zeroing in. That's important.

367
00:41:51,481 --> 00:41:54,150
- But I've got to talk to you!
- Come on!

368
00:41:56,861 --> 00:41:57,904
Hurry!

369
00:41:58,238 --> 00:42:00,114
Till the all clear!

370
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:03,535
But, Filby, I've got to talk to you!

371
00:42:36,567 --> 00:42:40,989
The labor of centuries,
gone in an instant.

372
00:42:51,749 --> 00:42:54,711
And then mother Earth,
aroused by man's violence...

373
00:42:54,919 --> 00:42:58,756
...responded with volcanic
violence of her own.

374
00:43:56,564 --> 00:44:02,069
Only my speed through time saved me from being
roasted alive and encased in stone forever.

375
00:44:03,613 --> 00:44:05,448
The molten rock cooled.

376
00:44:14,123 --> 00:44:15,666
I prayed...

377
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,920
...wondering how many centuries,
how many eons must pass...

378
00:44:19,128 --> 00:44:23,299
...before the wind and rain could wear
away the mountain that enclosed me.

379
00:44:36,813 --> 00:44:38,356
Darkness.

380
00:44:40,399 --> 00:44:42,401
Darkness for centuries.

381
00:44:45,404 --> 00:44:49,325
I wondered if there was still a war
being waged on the ground above me...

382
00:44:49,534 --> 00:44:53,579
...if man would still exist on
Earth when I saw the sun again.

383
00:44:54,372 --> 00:44:56,332
The centuries rolled by.

384
00:44:57,959 --> 00:45:00,002
I put my trust in time...

385
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:03,005
...and waited for the rock
to wear down around me.

386
00:45:06,551 --> 00:45:08,177
I was free again!

387
00:45:17,144 --> 00:45:21,148
Thousands of centuries had passed
but the Earth had stayed green.

388
00:45:21,399 --> 00:45:23,776
There was no winter, no wars.

389
00:45:24,986 --> 00:45:29,240
Had man finally learned to control
both the elements and himself?

390
00:45:29,782 --> 00:45:31,951
I had to stop and find out.

391
00:45:50,886 --> 00:45:52,888
But I'd stopped too fast.

392
00:47:10,966 --> 00:47:12,593
Magnificent!

393
00:47:14,053 --> 00:47:16,889
Flowers. Beautiful flowers everywhere!

394
00:47:17,932 --> 00:47:20,976
Natural splendor beyond compare.

395
00:47:24,355 --> 00:47:28,734
The whole landscape, one vast garden
without any sign of weeds or briars.

396
00:47:29,568 --> 00:47:33,989
Trees and vines laden with fruit
of strange shapes and colors.

397
00:47:34,615 --> 00:47:36,951
Nature tamed completely...

398
00:47:37,284 --> 00:47:39,829
...and more bountiful than ever before!

399
00:47:40,246 --> 00:47:42,748
At last I'd found a paradise.

400
00:47:45,417 --> 00:47:49,421
But it would be no paradise
if it'd belong to me alone.

401
00:48:10,859 --> 00:48:15,948
Unrepaired for centuries.
Maybe unlived-in for as long.

402
00:49:31,523 --> 00:49:33,317
Anybody here?

403
00:51:49,244 --> 00:51:53,915
So this is man's future: to bask in the
sunlight, bathe in the clear streams...

404
00:51:54,166 --> 00:51:58,545
...and eat the fruits of the Earth, with
all knowledge of work and hardship forgotten.

405
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:01,256
Well, and why not?

406
00:52:28,575 --> 00:52:31,078
Don't just sit there! Help her!

407
00:53:23,421 --> 00:53:24,965
Are you all right?

408
00:54:23,607 --> 00:54:25,066
Thank you.

409
00:54:26,985 --> 00:54:30,071
- Why did you?
- Why did I what?

410
00:54:31,156 --> 00:54:33,408
Come after me.

411
00:54:35,911 --> 00:54:37,787
Sit down.

412
00:54:42,042 --> 00:54:44,002
I did it to save your life.

413
00:54:44,461 --> 00:54:48,131
That doesn't seem to mean much to
you, or anybody else around here.

414
00:54:48,381 --> 00:54:50,300
It doesn't.

415
00:54:51,301 --> 00:54:54,471
Do you realize that there were about
twenty of your friends watching you drown.

416
00:54:54,679 --> 00:54:57,515
Not one of them so much as
lifted a finger to save you.

417
00:54:57,724 --> 00:55:00,101
That's a very curious attitude.

418
00:55:02,479 --> 00:55:04,230
Very curious world.

419
00:55:07,734 --> 00:55:12,197
Aren't you the least bit interested
in who I am? Where I come from?

420
00:55:12,781 --> 00:55:14,115
Should I be?

421
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:22,248
I think, perhaps, you better take me to
somebody a little older. Somebody I can talk to.

422
00:55:22,457 --> 00:55:24,209
There is no one older.

423
00:55:26,544 --> 00:55:29,714
Do you mean nobody ages
in this land of yours?

424
00:55:33,927 --> 00:55:37,472
- Well, what's your name?
- Weena.

425
00:55:41,017 --> 00:55:42,811
How do you spell it?

426
00:55:45,021 --> 00:55:48,483
- Spell?
- Spell, write. Can't you write?

427
00:55:50,193 --> 00:55:51,236
Look.

428
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:02,330
- What are your people called?
- Eloi.

429
00:56:15,009 --> 00:56:16,594
Come. We must go now.

430
00:56:16,803 --> 00:56:19,097
- Why, what's wrong?
- It's getting dark.

431
00:56:43,746 --> 00:56:44,330
Hello.

432
00:56:47,167 --> 00:56:50,086
I don't mind telling
you, I'm quite hungry.

433
00:56:51,588 --> 00:56:53,798
And I've come a long, long way.

434
00:56:57,927 --> 00:57:00,388
You know, in my time,
a berry that size...

435
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:03,808
...would've been big news
all over the civilized world.

436
00:57:08,771 --> 00:57:10,315
Excuse me, sir?

437
00:57:12,692 --> 00:57:14,235
Sir?

438
00:57:17,655 --> 00:57:20,366
Perhaps curiosity is died. Perhaps...

439
00:57:20,617 --> 00:57:24,996
...even courtesy is died, but I have come a
long way and I would like to know a few things.

440
00:57:25,538 --> 00:57:26,664
Why?

441
00:57:31,085 --> 00:57:36,007
Well, because I shall return to my time,
and my people will ask me questions.

442
00:57:36,966 --> 00:57:38,509
Such as:

443
00:57:38,801 --> 00:57:41,596
Well, what kind of
government rules your world?

444
00:57:42,305 --> 00:57:44,682
We have no government.

445
00:57:46,017 --> 00:57:50,897
Well, you must have a body of
men who pass and enforce laws.

446
00:57:51,856 --> 00:57:54,359
Laws? There are no laws.

447
00:57:58,363 --> 00:58:00,865
Where do you get food and clothing?

448
00:58:02,742 --> 00:58:04,702
Doesn't anybody work?

449
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:06,579
No.

450
00:58:08,539 --> 00:58:10,416
Well, where does all that come from?

451
00:58:10,792 --> 00:58:14,796
- It grows. It always grows.
- Yes, I know, but it must be...

452
00:58:15,505 --> 00:58:18,007
...cultivated and
planted and nurtured...

453
00:58:21,678 --> 00:58:23,179
Well, unless you...

454
00:58:23,388 --> 00:58:25,264
...well, you may have an economy so

455
00:58:25,306 --> 00:58:28,101
well-developed that you
can spend all your time...

456
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:31,938
...studying and
experimenting? Is that right?

457
00:58:32,355 --> 00:58:34,565
You ask many questions.

458
00:58:38,861 --> 00:58:42,281
Well, that is the only way that
man has learned and developed.

459
00:58:42,865 --> 00:58:44,200
I wish to learn.

460
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,415
I want to learn about you,
about your civilization.

461
00:58:59,132 --> 00:59:01,008
Perhaps you... Do you have books?

462
00:59:01,551 --> 00:59:03,261
Books?

463
00:59:03,511 --> 00:59:06,013
- Yes, we have books.
- Ah, wonderful!

464
00:59:06,222 --> 00:59:11,018
I can learn all I want about you from books.
Books will tell me what I want to know.

465
00:59:13,312 --> 00:59:14,897
Could I see the books?

466
00:59:47,972 --> 00:59:50,475
Yes, they do tell me all about you.

467
01:00:05,239 --> 01:00:06,741
What have you done?

468
01:00:07,074 --> 01:00:11,621
Thousands of years of building and
rebuilding, creating and re-creating...

469
01:00:11,829 --> 01:00:14,457
...so you can let it
all crumble to dust!

470
01:00:16,417 --> 01:00:20,213
A million years of sensitive
men dying for their dreams.

471
01:00:20,421 --> 01:00:21,672
For what?!

472
01:00:22,548 --> 01:00:26,260
So you can swim and dance...

473
01:00:27,345 --> 01:00:28,930
...and play!

474
01:00:38,814 --> 01:00:41,025
You! All of you!

475
01:00:41,651 --> 01:00:45,863
I'm going back to my own time! I won't again
bother to tell of the useless struggle...

476
01:00:46,072 --> 01:00:50,117
...the hopeless future. But
at least I could die among men!

477
01:04:10,776 --> 01:04:13,988
- Weena, what are you doing?
- I hear you pounding. I came to warn you.

478
01:04:14,196 --> 01:04:18,784
- Weena, how do you open that panel?
- No one opens it. Only the Morlocks.

479
01:04:19,451 --> 01:04:21,036
The Morlocks? But who are the Morlocks?

480
01:04:24,748 --> 01:04:28,961
They give us the food we eat and the
clothes we wear. We must obey their command.

481
01:04:29,294 --> 01:04:31,005
Why'd they taken my machine?

482
01:04:32,589 --> 01:04:34,425
Weena, you've got to tell me!

483
01:04:37,261 --> 01:04:39,638
But... it is night. We
mustn't be out in the dark.

484
01:04:40,514 --> 01:04:43,183
Only little children are
frightened by the dark.

485
01:04:44,476 --> 01:04:46,186
And you are a little child, aren't you?

486
01:04:46,437 --> 01:04:49,106
- Well, don't be frightened, I'll light a fire.
- Please, let us go.

487
01:04:49,314 --> 01:04:51,156
Weena, I can't. My machine
is inside there. I've got to

488
01:04:51,191 --> 01:04:53,277
wait here until morning and
find some way of getting it out.

489
01:04:53,569 --> 01:04:56,864
- No, you mustn't.
- Come on. Help me gather some wood.

490
01:05:12,171 --> 01:05:13,630
That's a girl.

491
01:05:22,639 --> 01:05:24,349
Where are you from?

492
01:05:26,727 --> 01:05:29,563
As a matter of fact,
I'm from right here.

493
01:05:32,065 --> 01:05:34,401
That's where my house used to be...

494
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:37,404
...many thousands of years ago.

495
01:05:39,448 --> 01:05:40,824
You see there?

496
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:45,662
From there up to those
panels was my laboratory.

497
01:05:46,789 --> 01:05:49,917
Then beyond the panels was
where my garden used to be.

498
01:05:52,461 --> 01:05:53,504
Right there.

499
01:05:54,671 --> 01:05:56,798
That was my library.

500
01:05:57,549 --> 01:06:00,469
Where I once sat talking
with friends about...

501
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:02,596
...the time machine.

502
01:06:13,106 --> 01:06:14,483
You know, Weena,..

503
01:06:15,734 --> 01:06:18,070
...I'd hoped to learn such a great deal.

504
01:06:21,532 --> 01:06:25,911
I'd hoped to take back the knowledge and
the advancement that mankind had made.

505
01:06:26,912 --> 01:06:29,206
And instead, I find vegetables.

506
01:06:30,374 --> 01:06:33,502
The human race reduced
to living vegetables.

507
01:06:46,181 --> 01:06:49,101
They're gone. Are you all right?

508
01:06:53,272 --> 01:06:55,190
- That was a Morlock, was it?
- Yes.

509
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,860
Oh, don't you worry. The
fire seems to keep them away.

510
01:07:13,417 --> 01:07:16,962
What are you doing? Why did
you put your hand in the fire?

511
01:07:17,212 --> 01:07:19,006
I never saw it before.

512
01:07:24,303 --> 01:07:26,013
No knowledge of fire?

513
01:07:27,848 --> 01:07:29,391
No books? No...

514
01:07:33,311 --> 01:07:34,938
I'm terribly sorry.

515
01:07:36,648 --> 01:07:39,943
I'm sorry I was angry with your
people. I had no right to be.

516
01:07:42,154 --> 01:07:47,242
No more than if I'd visited the
island of Bali in my own time.

517
01:07:51,496 --> 01:07:53,081
But, you know, Weena...

518
01:07:53,999 --> 01:07:58,545
You were safe inside your great house, and
yet you came out into the night to warn me.

519
01:07:59,379 --> 01:08:03,592
The one characteristic which distinguished
man from the animal kingdom...

520
01:08:04,551 --> 01:08:07,095
...was the spirit of self-sacrifice.

521
01:08:08,263 --> 01:08:10,140
And you have that quality.

522
01:08:11,141 --> 01:08:15,520
I think all your people have it really.
It just needs someone to reawaken it.

523
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:21,276
I should like to try, if you let me.

524
01:08:21,526 --> 01:08:22,736
Will you?

525
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:25,739
I do not understand you...

526
01:08:26,948 --> 01:08:28,825
...but I believe you.

527
01:08:29,117 --> 01:08:31,161
That's as good a start as any.

528
01:08:34,247 --> 01:08:38,043
Try to tell me. The Morlocks
- who or what are the Morlocks?

529
01:08:38,335 --> 01:08:40,712
Are they animals or people?

530
01:08:44,341 --> 01:08:46,218
Well, what about yourself?

531
01:08:47,427 --> 01:08:50,514
The past. Don't your people
ever speak of the past?

532
01:08:51,598 --> 01:08:53,350
There is no past.

533
01:08:55,727 --> 01:08:58,855
Well, do they ever
wonder about the future?

534
01:09:00,565 --> 01:09:02,025
There is no future.

535
01:09:07,739 --> 01:09:09,199
Well, the past,..

536
01:09:09,658 --> 01:09:11,034
...man's past,..

537
01:09:13,995 --> 01:09:16,748
...is mainly a grim
struggle for survival.

538
01:09:17,582 --> 01:09:22,212
But there have been moments when
a few voices have spoken up...

539
01:09:23,547 --> 01:09:27,300
...and these rare moments have made
the history of man - man's past -..

540
01:09:28,009 --> 01:09:29,928
...a glorious thing.

541
01:09:32,013 --> 01:09:34,766
I refuse to believe it's dead and gone.

542
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:39,563
We've had our dark ages before. And
this is just another one of them.

543
01:09:41,106 --> 01:09:44,317
All it needs is for someone
to show you the way out.

544
01:09:47,487 --> 01:09:49,364
I'm only a tinkering mechanic, but...

545
01:09:49,614 --> 01:09:53,118
...I'm sure there must be this
hidden spark in one of your people.

546
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:56,288
If only I can kindle that spark...

547
01:09:57,163 --> 01:09:59,499
...my coming here
will have some meaning.

548
01:10:07,173 --> 01:10:10,093
My efforts next morning to
open the panel were fruitless.

549
01:10:10,343 --> 01:10:13,722
I had to find another way
to retrieve my machine.

550
01:10:21,688 --> 01:10:23,148
Listen.

551
01:10:24,149 --> 01:10:25,692
Weenie, you hear that?

552
01:10:27,736 --> 01:10:29,195
Yes.

553
01:10:30,196 --> 01:10:31,865
Machines?

554
01:10:32,324 --> 01:10:34,367
- No, Morlocks.
- Wait.

555
01:10:34,868 --> 01:10:37,120
You mean those animals run machines?

556
01:10:37,495 --> 01:10:39,414
They are Morlocks.

557
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:44,836
- But, have you ever seen the machines?
- No, only heard of them.

558
01:10:45,712 --> 01:10:48,465
- But, who told you?
- The rings.

559
01:10:50,091 --> 01:10:53,011
- What sort of rings?
- Rings that talk.

560
01:10:55,138 --> 01:10:57,515
Could you show me these talking rings?

561
01:11:07,859 --> 01:11:09,819
Come, this way.

562
01:11:24,459 --> 01:11:27,045
- These are the talking rings?
- Yes.

563
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:30,340
They speak?

564
01:11:32,342 --> 01:11:33,718
Of what?

565
01:11:34,636 --> 01:11:37,097
Things no one here understands.

566
01:11:38,098 --> 01:11:39,307
Make it talk.

567
01:11:44,104 --> 01:11:49,150
The war between the East and West,
which is now in its 326th year,..

568
01:11:49,609 --> 01:11:51,569
...has at last come to an end.

569
01:11:52,153 --> 01:11:55,949
There is nothing left to fight
with and few of us left to fight.

570
01:11:56,366 --> 01:11:59,661
The atmosphere has become so
polluted with deadly germs...

571
01:11:59,911 --> 01:12:02,497
...that it can no longer be breathed.

572
01:12:02,747 --> 01:12:05,250
There is no place on this
planet that is immune.

573
01:12:05,917 --> 01:12:10,713
The last surviving factory for the
manufacture of oxygen has been destroyed.

574
01:12:11,422 --> 01:12:14,092
Stockpiles are rapidly diminishing...

575
01:12:14,384 --> 01:12:17,220
...and when they are gone, we must die.

576
01:12:29,315 --> 01:12:31,359
My name is of no consequence.

577
01:12:32,819 --> 01:12:38,575
The important thing you should know is that
I am the last who remembers how each of us...

578
01:12:38,950 --> 01:12:43,246
...man and woman, made his own decision.

579
01:12:43,496 --> 01:12:46,874
Some chose to take refuge
in the great caverns...

580
01:12:47,125 --> 01:12:51,671
...and find a new way of life
far below the Earth's surface.

581
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:56,634
The rest of us decided to take
our chances in the sunlight...

582
01:12:57,927 --> 01:13:01,014
...small as those chances might be.

583
01:13:02,223 --> 01:13:06,352
From the talking rings I learned
how the human race divided itself...

584
01:13:06,811 --> 01:13:10,857
...and how the world of the
Eloi and the Morlocks began.

585
01:13:11,816 --> 01:13:15,236
By some awful quirk of fate...

586
01:13:15,486 --> 01:13:20,283
...the Morlocks had became the
masters and the Eloi, their servants.

587
01:13:20,575 --> 01:13:24,287
The Morlocks maintained
them and bred them like...

588
01:13:24,537 --> 01:13:25,830
...like cattle...

589
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:29,417
...only to take them below
when they reached maturity.

590
01:13:29,667 --> 01:13:32,837
Which explained why there were
no older people among them.

591
01:13:33,087 --> 01:13:35,339
Now I knew I must go below.
It was the only mean to

592
01:13:35,374 --> 01:13:37,592
finding a way up into the
Spfinx to reach my machine...

593
01:13:37,842 --> 01:13:41,137
...and find out what happened to the
little people when they did go below.

594
01:13:41,596 --> 01:13:42,972
Don't go!

595
01:13:57,111 --> 01:14:00,573
- You won't come back!
- I'll be back.

596
01:14:16,005 --> 01:14:17,131
Weena?

597
01:14:59,757 --> 01:15:01,217
Weena, answer me!

598
01:15:01,676 --> 01:15:03,052
Where are you?

599
01:15:30,997 --> 01:15:32,373
What's happening?

600
01:15:33,875 --> 01:15:35,251
What's happening?

601
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:38,629
What's the matter with you all?

602
01:15:56,731 --> 01:15:58,357
Weena, stop!

603
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:48,991
Stop!

604
01:16:50,785 --> 01:16:52,536
Well, what happens to them?

605
01:16:56,290 --> 01:17:00,127
Don't stand there like fatted
cattle! Will you answer me?

606
01:17:02,505 --> 01:17:07,301
- What is wrong?
- There is nothing wrong. It is all clear.

607
01:17:10,221 --> 01:17:13,682
- What do you mean, all clear?
- All clear.

608
01:17:15,810 --> 01:17:20,689
In the middle-1900s, the falling bombs,
the people calling out, "All clear!".

609
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:22,066
No!

610
01:17:22,316 --> 01:17:24,402
That's gone! That's passed!

611
01:17:24,652 --> 01:17:28,447
There are no more flying machines!
No more bombs! No more wars!

612
01:17:28,823 --> 01:17:31,742
The rings have told us that story.

613
01:17:32,201 --> 01:17:35,413
But you didn't listen!
You didn't learn anything!

614
01:17:35,663 --> 01:17:40,209
It was ages ago that men were taught to
hide below the ground when the sirens blew...

615
01:17:40,459 --> 01:17:43,129
...to run from the reigning
death, but it's over!

616
01:17:43,379 --> 01:17:46,715
Those men are dead. The men
who slaughtered them are dead!

617
01:17:48,217 --> 01:17:51,762
But there is nothing to
fear. It is all clear.

618
01:17:52,096 --> 01:17:56,851
What about the ones who went below?
How do you think they gonna come back?

619
01:17:57,768 --> 01:17:59,228
They never come back.

620
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:05,568
- Nobody can bring them back.
- You can try. You can try!

621
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:08,696
Won't even one of you try?!

622
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:14,577
Well, I'll try!

623
01:20:32,339 --> 01:20:35,384
So this was the destiny of the Eloi.

624
01:20:37,302 --> 01:20:40,180
They were being bred by the Morlocks...

625
01:20:40,472 --> 01:20:44,351
...who had degenerated into
the lowest form of human life:

626
01:20:44,685 --> 01:20:45,936
Cannibalism!

627
01:22:32,709 --> 01:22:35,837
Weena, wake up! Come to
your senses! All of you!

628
01:24:07,262 --> 01:24:08,388
Burn.

629
01:24:08,889 --> 01:24:11,892
Give me something to
burn. It's my last match.

630
01:24:20,942 --> 01:24:23,653
Get up the stairs! That's
the way out! Quickly!

631
01:25:31,054 --> 01:25:32,806
The torch!

632
01:25:37,978 --> 01:25:39,771
Weenie, get the torch!

633
01:26:32,449 --> 01:26:35,368
Get up the steps! Hurry up!

634
01:28:18,554 --> 01:28:21,766
All right, get all the
deadwood! Come on! All the wood!

635
01:28:23,101 --> 01:28:25,937
That's fine. Come on, throw it down!

636
01:28:27,730 --> 01:28:29,357
All the deadwood!

637
01:28:32,944 --> 01:28:36,155
Throw it down! Do the
same to the other wells!

638
01:28:36,614 --> 01:28:38,700
All the wood down the wells!

639
01:28:49,961 --> 01:28:53,297
All right, to the river!
Come on! Back to the river!

640
01:29:23,953 --> 01:29:25,788
All right, let's go!

641
01:29:32,628 --> 01:29:37,341
Another night was coming, but
this night no Eloi needed to fear.

642
01:29:41,179 --> 01:29:44,182
The underworld of the
Morlocks was gone...

643
01:29:44,432 --> 01:29:47,477
...and so was the life
of leisure for the Eloi.

644
01:29:50,605 --> 01:29:52,148
But then what of me?

645
01:29:52,690 --> 01:29:55,401
I was imprisoned in a world...

646
01:29:55,651 --> 01:29:58,529
...in which I just did not belong.

647
01:30:00,490 --> 01:30:02,283
Are you sorry?

648
01:30:03,951 --> 01:30:07,872
- Sorry? Sorry for what?
- That you have to stay?

649
01:30:11,209 --> 01:30:12,502
Yes.

650
01:30:13,753 --> 01:30:16,964
I'm sorry because I could tell so
much to the people of my time, Weena.

651
01:30:17,507 --> 01:30:18,883
I could let them know...

652
01:30:19,717 --> 01:30:23,554
...about the sorrow and the happiness
that the future has installed for them.

653
01:30:23,804 --> 01:30:25,890
Maybe they could learn from it.

654
01:30:27,058 --> 01:30:28,434
Or could they?

655
01:30:31,395 --> 01:30:35,233
- You don't want to stay, do you?
- It isn't that.

656
01:30:36,025 --> 01:30:40,613
It's just that I don't really fit here
any more than you would in my time.

657
01:30:41,239 --> 01:30:43,824
I would love to see your time.

658
01:30:44,992 --> 01:30:47,370
You wouldn't be very happy there.

659
01:30:48,037 --> 01:30:51,207
Do you have someone
there? Someone like me?

660
01:30:52,458 --> 01:30:54,085
No, no one like you.

661
01:30:57,380 --> 01:31:00,591
I have friends, of course,
friends who'll miss me.

662
01:31:01,259 --> 01:31:03,135
As a matter of fact, I'm
probably late already.

663
01:31:04,428 --> 01:31:05,721
Women?

664
01:31:07,473 --> 01:31:09,058
No.

665
01:31:11,978 --> 01:31:14,063
As a matter of fact, there is one woman.

666
01:31:15,356 --> 01:31:20,194
But she looks after my house for me.
And she's 62 years old and all wrinkled.

667
01:31:25,491 --> 01:31:27,618
How do they wear their hair?

668
01:31:27,868 --> 01:31:29,996
- Who?
- The women of your time.

669
01:31:33,082 --> 01:31:35,459
- Up.
- Up?

670
01:31:37,586 --> 01:31:39,046
Up how?

671
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:42,466
I don't know. Kind of...

672
01:31:43,217 --> 01:31:44,969
...up, like that.

673
01:31:46,053 --> 01:31:47,305
Show me!

674
01:32:01,902 --> 01:32:03,487
Would I be pretty?

675
01:32:06,032 --> 01:32:08,784
Yes, you would. Very pretty.

676
01:32:12,955 --> 01:32:15,458
Oh, Weena, I wish we
could go back to my time.

677
01:32:16,042 --> 01:32:19,295
Or even into time before
that, when the world was young.

678
01:32:19,545 --> 01:32:22,590
- We could be so very happy.
- Look!

679
01:32:42,860 --> 01:32:44,487
My machine!

680
01:32:46,238 --> 01:32:47,698
Come on, Weena!

681
01:34:07,194 --> 01:34:11,949
I was going the wrong way!
Back! I had to go back!

682
01:36:13,153 --> 01:36:17,366
Well, It's the most ridiculous story
I've ever heard. Absolutely preposterous!

683
01:36:17,825 --> 01:36:21,537
Well, there's one thing I'll say for you,
George, you always could tell a good yarn.

684
01:36:21,787 --> 01:36:24,456
You're a truly great inventor, George.

685
01:36:25,624 --> 01:36:28,001
I think you ought to retire, sir.

686
01:36:29,753 --> 01:36:33,882
Truthfully, George, where
have you been the past week?

687
01:36:34,132 --> 01:36:36,260
You shouldn't ask such questions.

688
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:40,472
It's not hard for a man to lose
a little week now and again.

689
01:36:42,850 --> 01:36:46,770
I can understand your doubt, my
friends. Take it as a lie if you wish.

690
01:36:48,021 --> 01:36:51,108
I scarcely believe it
myself, now that I'm back.

691
01:36:57,739 --> 01:37:00,826
David, there's the flower Weena gave me.

692
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:05,872
A present for you. You were
always interested in botany.

693
01:37:06,123 --> 01:37:08,792
Try and match that with
any species known today!

694
01:37:14,047 --> 01:37:15,924
I don't think I can.

695
01:37:19,928 --> 01:37:21,638
Well, time to go, Bridewell.

696
01:37:22,139 --> 01:37:25,267
- Yes, it is getting late.
- Good night, George.

697
01:37:25,517 --> 01:37:26,893
Good night, George.

698
01:37:32,649 --> 01:37:36,153
You look exhausted, George.
You really should get some rest.

699
01:38:01,011 --> 01:38:03,513
Good night, George. It's
grand having you back.

700
01:38:04,264 --> 01:38:05,474
Goodbye, David.

701
01:38:14,316 --> 01:38:17,986
Thanks for being such a
good friend, David. Always.

702
01:38:33,418 --> 01:38:35,253
What do you think, Filby?

703
01:38:35,796 --> 01:38:37,339
One thing is certain.

704
01:38:37,547 --> 01:38:40,550
That flower couldn't possibly
have bloomed in the wintertime.

705
01:38:40,801 --> 01:38:43,637
You don't really believe
that story is true, do you?

706
01:38:44,888 --> 01:38:46,181
Good night.

707
01:38:48,016 --> 01:38:49,392
Go on, driver.

708
01:39:37,149 --> 01:39:40,193
- Mr. Filby, what..?
- He's gone!

709
01:39:42,237 --> 01:39:43,697
Why, look!

710
01:39:52,747 --> 01:39:56,418
I think I understand.
You see the imprint?

711
01:39:57,544 --> 01:40:00,714
This is where the time
machine originally stood.

712
01:40:01,089 --> 01:40:03,008
But the Morlocks moved it.

713
01:40:03,842 --> 01:40:06,678
They dragged it across the lawn...

714
01:40:06,970 --> 01:40:09,890
...right into the Sphinx. Right there.

715
01:40:11,433 --> 01:40:16,396
And Weena was standing
here when he last saw her.

716
01:40:16,646 --> 01:40:21,151
Right here! The same
space in a different time.

717
01:40:23,278 --> 01:40:26,740
So he dragged his heavy
machine back in here...

718
01:40:27,657 --> 01:40:29,200
...scratching the floor...

719
01:40:30,201 --> 01:40:33,288
...so that he could appear
outside the sphinx again...

720
01:40:34,289 --> 01:40:37,208
...and help the Eloi build a new world.

721
01:40:38,710 --> 01:40:41,588
Build a new world for himself.

722
01:40:43,089 --> 01:40:45,967
- Right where he left her.
- Yes.

723
01:40:56,853 --> 01:41:00,565
It's not like George
to return empty-handed.

724
01:41:00,857 --> 01:41:04,194
To try to rebuild a
civilization without a plan.

725
01:41:05,195 --> 01:41:07,864
He must have taken something with him.

726
01:41:09,866 --> 01:41:11,326
Nothing.

727
01:41:18,416 --> 01:41:22,128
- Except three books.
- Which three books?

728
01:41:23,004 --> 01:41:26,216
I don't know. Is it important?

729
01:41:28,009 --> 01:41:29,552
I suppose not.

730
01:41:31,221 --> 01:41:32,347
Only...

731
01:41:33,348 --> 01:41:36,017
...which three books
would you have taken?

732
01:41:42,607 --> 01:41:45,819
Mr. Filby, do you
think he'll ever return?

733
01:41:46,486 --> 01:41:48,655
One cannot choose but wonder.

734
01:41:48,905 --> 01:41:52,951
You see, he has all
the time in the world.
