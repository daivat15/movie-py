1
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,509
Where's Bailey?

2
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,261
Deaf and dumb, eh?

3
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,776
Can you read lips?

4
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,904
Where is Bailey?

5
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,991
Coming back today?

6
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,415
Come on.

7
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,012
- Hello, Marny.
- Well, look who is back.

8
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,764
- Did you dye your hair?
- Why?

9
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,557
I keep thinking of you as a blond.

10
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,686
For all the thinking you do about
me, I could be bald-headed.

11
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,480
Ham on rye. Did you miss me, honey?

12
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:12,525
If I didn't, I can't think
of anybody else who did.

13
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:16,028
- One thing's sure, Bailey don't miss nothing.
- Neither do you.

14
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,072
She's your girl, and
he ain't my man.

15
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:21,033
So it's no skin off my nose.
I just see what I see.

16
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,952
You sure you don't
see what you hear?

17
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:26,330
Nothing can happen in this town
that I don't hear about it.

18
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm just saying what I see. Every
day they go fishing together.

19
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,711
Look, the sandwich.

20
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:36,424
Burning hamburger and a romance.

21
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,634
You got a customer.

22
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,177
- What'll you have?
- Coffee.

23
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:43,607
- Nothing else?
- Cream.

24
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,225
- Where you been this time?
- L.A.

25
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,102
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.

26
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,730
First she's got you, now
she's got you and Bailey.

27
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,691
And the only thing I
seem to get is older.

28
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,461
Thanks a lot, Marny.
I'll see you later.

29
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,700
Hmm. I guess I must
have said something.

30
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,253
You talked enough.

31
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,747
Everything people ought to know
they just don't want to hear.

32
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,707
That's the trouble with the world.

33
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,877
Either that or you're on the
wrong side of the counter.

34
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,338
- Tell me something.
- You don't look as though I could.

35
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,759
That, uh, Bailey who burns you
up, he run the gas station?

36
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,053
- Do you know him?
- I might have once.

37
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:26,348
If he keeps mooning around
Jim's girl, nobody'll know him...

38
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,809
and that'd be too bad.

39
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,438
You, uh, see much of this Bailey?

40
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,441
Yeah, every day from here.

41
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,526
I often wondered what
happened to him...

42
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:42,333
then one day I'm breezing through here,
and there's his name up on a sign.

43
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:47,338
- It's a small world.
- Yeah, or a big sign.

44
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:08,405
- They're just not feeding today.
- They will later. It's clouding up.

45
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:12,061
They say the day you die,
your name is written on a cloud.

46
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,230
- Who says?
- They.

47
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,440
Never heard of them.

48
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,693
Nothing in that one but rain.
Think we ought to go home?

49
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,111
Yes.

50
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,961
- Do you want to?
- No.

51
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:30,037
Every time I look at the sky, I think
of all the places I've never been.

52
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,808
Yes, and every time you look
up, they're all the same.

53
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,837
- You've been a lot of places, haven't you?
- One too many.

54
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:41,131
- Which did you like best?
- This one right here.

55
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:45,094
- I bet you say that to all the places.
- You see that cove over there?

56
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,137
I'd like to build a
house right there...

57
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:50,738
marry you, live in it and
never go anywhere else.

58
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,987
I wish you would.

59
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:04,196
You were never married
before, were you?

60
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,490
Not that I can remember.

61
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,409
That's good.

62
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,537
You'd be amazed the way
people talk about you.

63
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:15,138
The mysterious Jeff Bailey.

64
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:19,587
My mother tells me that I've only
known you for such a short time.

65
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:22,266
And where'd you come from?
And what did you do?

66
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,111
My father was...

67
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,149
- We'd better go.
- Is something the matter?

68
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,202
Maybe not.

69
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,124
Here.

70
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:55,140
You sure are a secret man.

71
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,043
Thanks.

72
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,962
Oh, a man just wants to see me.

73
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,685
Oh.

74
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:27,613
- A long time.
- Hello, Joe. I wish it was nicer to see you.

75
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,950
Everyone sure missed you, Jeff,
but not as much as I have.

76
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,118
- How's that?
- Whit used to look at me...

77
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,497
shake his head, and wish
I had brains like you.

78
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:40,501
- What's the other reason?
- I had to find you.

79
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,628
- I owe you something?
- Not me.

80
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,505
Who?

81
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:48,217
- How far can that kid read lips?
- I don't know. I'll ask him some time.

82
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,219
This far?

83
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,056
- You don't like to make mistakes, do you?
- They don't let me have many.

84
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,610
All right, come on inside.

85
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:05,776
- Funny racket to find you in, Jeff.
- Yeah, me and the kid laugh all the time.

86
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:08,487
Heh. I guess that's
because it's respectable.

87
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,532
That hash slinger across the
street says you are too.

88
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:15,285
- How did you happen to find me, Joe?
- I was driving down the road one day...

89
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:20,457
and who do I see pumping gasoline
but my old chum from the old times.

90
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,793
Of course, there's a
different name on the sign.

91
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,546
- So you just dropped in?
- Why not?

92
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,674
Okay, then I'm glad to
see an old pal too.

93
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:32,636
So I take you to dinner, buy you
drinks, it gets late chewing the fat...

94
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,055
you hop in your car and
you're gone. Right?

95
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,975
- Almost.
- What else?

96
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,269
I'm still working
for that guy, Jeff.

97
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,563
- Whit?
- He'd like to see you.

98
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,274
- As much as you did?
- Heh.

99
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:48,360
- Worse.
- I see.

100
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,738
No one ever thought
more of you than Whit.

101
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,197
Or more about me.

102
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,784
Well, that could be too.

103
00:08:55,785 --> 00:09:00,247
- All right, what's he want, Joe?
- Maybe he's got something nice for you.

104
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,999
- Try once more.
- Heh.

105
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,586
Look, Whit never steered you
into anything bad, did he?

106
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:09,339
Why, he never even squawked when you
blew the best thing he ever gave you.

107
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,510
- Go on.
- The guy just wants to see you.

108
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,596
Well, you put it that
way, what can I do?

109
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,525
You know of any other
way to put it?

110
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,979
- Say tomorrow morning?
- Where?

111
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:29,787
Lake Tahoe. Turn right at Emerald Bay.
Big house on a hill. You won't miss it.

112
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,956
You can't.

113
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,554
Ann? John, are you
letting her out like this?

114
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:02,656
Are you gonna stand for it, with a
man who won't even come to the door?

115
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,240
Don't worry about them.

116
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,827
- Darling.
- It's no good, is it?

117
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:15,364
- It doesn't matter. It's just that they...
- Oh, honey, I know how they feel.

118
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:18,158
- Don't worry about it.
- I'm not.

119
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,287
- Then don't look so grim.
- No, it's something else.

120
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,541
- What?
- That guy that showed up today...

121
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,668
Yes?

122
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,753
You want to ride with
me up to Lake Tahoe?

123
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,964
- Now?
- Yes, now.

124
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,549
I want to tell you something.

125
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,676
All right, Jeff.

126
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,637
You told me once I'd have
to tell you sometime.

127
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,691
Well, this is it.

128
00:10:56,865 --> 00:11:01,785
Now, the first thing I wanna get off my
My name isn't Bailey, it's Markham.

129
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:06,415
- Markham. Jeff Markham?
- I should have told you before.

130
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:10,043
I meant to, but I kept
putting it off...

131
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,838
because I didn't
like any part of it.

132
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,133
- Please tell me, Jeff.
- Some of it's gonna hurt you.

133
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,552
It doesn't matter.

134
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:22,181
Well, our friend Markham
lived in New York.

135
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:26,894
He worked with a sort of stupid,
oily gent by the name of Jack Fisher.

136
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:30,314
We called ourselves detectives.

137
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:33,942
That was about three
years ago, maybe more.

138
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:38,655
Wintertime. One of the coldest
days I remember in the town.

139
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,991
And we got a call to
come and see a big op.

140
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:44,786
- A what?
- An operator, gambler.

141
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:48,707
He didn't come to see us because he
was too high-powered a character.

142
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:53,170
Also, because some dame had taken
four shots at him with his own .38.

143
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,769
Made one of them good.

144
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:03,180
He was taking it in stride, but he
had a friend who was a ball of fire.

145
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:07,267
Newspaper guys, wise guys, who
do they think they're kidding?

146
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,686
So he shot himself
cleaning a cap pistol.

147
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,106
So I shot the ace of spades out
of a sleeve during a gin game.

148
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,108
A guy can't even get
shot by a dame...

149
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,237
without the whole town
starting to buzz like a...

150
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:22,463
Like you? Smoke a cigarette, Joe.

151
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:29,164
You just sit and stay inside yourself.
You wait for me to talk. I like that.

152
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,208
I never found out much
listening to myself.

153
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,638
Hmm.

154
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:40,259
- It amazes me how she missed so often.
- Maybe you were moving.

155
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,109
A dame with a rod is like a
guy with a knitting needle.

156
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:46,991
- What's he doing here? I called you.
- My partner.

157
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:53,021
- Should I ask why you didn't call the law?
- Should you?

158
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,149
Heh. I guess not.

159
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,652
- Anything happen to her?
- She ran out on me.

160
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:01,196
- With 40,000 bucks.
- I want her back.

161
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,823
Or the money?

162
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:09,788
You know, I once bet $40,000 on a horse
that ran dead last, so I bought the horse.

163
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,707
Yeah, that's what I mean.

164
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:16,295
Oh, you're wrong. I put that
horse in a nice green pasture...

165
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,089
so he'd never get his foot
caught in a mutuel machine.

166
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,643
You should go out and
visit it sometime.

167
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:28,682
No, I just want her back. When you
see her, you'll understand better.

168
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,281
Maybe she's just an impulsive girl.

169
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,326
- Shall we let it go at that?
- I can let it all go.

170
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:42,957
An even 5000 now and 5
when you bring her back.

171
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,157
And expenses.

172
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,035
Now, that should have been
the first thing you said.

173
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:51,705
- Find her, Jeff. Bring her back.
- Why me?

174
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:58,059
Well, I know a lot of smart guys and
a few honest ones, and you're both.

175
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,009
What happens to her?

176
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,778
I won't touch her.

177
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,784
Okay.

178
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:17,522
Get me the stuff on her family,
pictures, anything interesting.

179
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,608
- You'll get it.
- I'll see you.

180
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:23,288
You bring it over, Joe.
Come on, let's go.

181
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:28,293
Oh, by the way, you mind
telling me her name?

182
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:34,140
- Kathie Moffat.
- Thanks.

183
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:41,380
She must be quite a dame.
A wild goose with 40 G's.

184
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,841
You know, for a smart guy, that
Sterling sure trusts you, don't he?

185
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,343
Why not?

186
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,345
- Am I going along?
- No.

187
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:52,682
Oh, he doesn't like my personality, huh?
Well, I'm still in, Jeff, fifty-fifty.

188
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,894
- Did I say anything different?
- All right. It's a good soft touch.

189
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,825
Don't get hot at me. And
don't get any cute ideas.

190
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,001
These are on me.

191
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:24,172
This is an old friend of mine, Jeff Markham.
He wants to ask you something.

192
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,884
- Which one of you is Eunice Leonard?
- Me.

193
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,938
May I ask you a few questions?

194
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,944
Come on, honey, let's dance.

195
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,274
You work for Katherine Moffat?

196
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,193
Not anymore, she's gone.
She got pushed around.

197
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,447
I wouldn't have stayed myself,
only she got sick being vaccinated.

198
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,074
- How come you're asking?
- I want to find her.

199
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:55,078
- You want to find her for that man?
- No, for myself. Where'd she go?

200
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,874
- Maybe I oughtn't to tell nothing.
- More harm might come to her if you didn't.

201
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:02,669
- Is she in harm now?
- I don't know, she disappeared.

202
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,339
- Maybe you better say, honey.
- Well, I can't say much.

203
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,009
It wasn't no cold place though.
That girl hated snow.

204
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,387
Them clothes she took, she was
looking for sun. Florida.

205
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:16,641
- You sure about that?
- Now I seem to remember, and I'm sure.

206
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:20,061
- No trunk?
- She only took suitcases.

207
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,231
- You're sure again?
- I know, I weighed them for her.

208
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,026
- How much did they weigh?
- 131 pounds.

209
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:27,527
- Exactly?
- Exactly.

210
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:31,198
- On account of that's what I weigh myself.
- Thanks.

211
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,627
Bring them another round.

212
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:39,164
You don't get vaccinated for
Florida, but you do for Mexico.

213
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:43,376
So I just followed that 90 pounds
of excess baggage to Mexico City.

214
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,587
She had been at the
Reforma and then gone.

215
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,006
I took the bus south like she did.

216
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:52,093
It was hot in Taxco. You say to
yourself, "How hot can it get?"

217
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,679
And then in Acapulco, you find out.

218
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,139
She had to wind up here...

219
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,226
because if you wanna go south,
here's where you get the boat.

220
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,279
All I had to do was wait.

221
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:06,125
Near the plaza was a little café called
La Mar Azul next to a movie house.

222
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,654
I sat there in the
afternoons and drank beer.

223
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:14,032
I used to sit there half-asleep
with a beer and the darkness...

224
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:18,328
only that music from the movie
next door kept jarring me awake.

225
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:22,165
And then I saw her
coming out of the sun...

226
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,835
and I knew why Whit didn't
care about that 40 grand.

227
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,003
Cuba Libre, please.

228
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,028
Señorita, señor, may
I speak some words?

229
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:56,584
- You will be seated, señor, huh? Yes?
- With pleasure, señor.

230
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:02,247
I am José Rodriguez, a guide,
a most excellent guide.

231
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,499
- Indeed?
- You ask them.

232
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,336
They can tell you that José Rodriguez
knows Acapulco as no one else.

233
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,755
- Each little street...
- I don't want a guide.

234
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:14,593
- A very difficult girl.
- Heh. Is there one not so, señor?

235
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,137
- Perhaps a lottery ticket?
- No.

236
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:21,725
I have here, wrought by
skilled hands, a ring...

237
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:25,395
and earrings of jade
and pure silver.

238
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,619
These.

239
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:37,240
- I never wear them.
- Nor I. Please.

240
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,451
No, thank you.

241
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,329
My name is Jeff Markham, and I
haven't talked to anybody...

242
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,053
who hasn't tried to sell
me something for 10 days.

243
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:50,267
If I don't talk, I think. It's too late
in life for me to start thinking.

244
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,716
I could go down to the cliff and
look at the sea like a good tourist.

245
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:58,887
But it's no good if there isn't somebody
you can turn to and say, "Nice view, huh?"

246
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:02,599
It's the same with the churches, the
relics, the moonlight or a Cuba Libre.

247
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,435
Nothing in the world is any
good unless you can share it.

248
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,238
Maybe you ought to go home.

249
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:11,205
- Maybe that's why I'm here.
- Is it?

250
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,830
Well, there's always
José Rodriguez.

251
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:19,505
If it gets too lonely, there's a cantina
down the street called Pablo's.

252
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:24,162
It's nice and quiet. The man there
plays American music for a dollar.

253
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:28,809
Sip bourbon and shut your eyes.
It's like a little place on 56th Street.

254
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,095
I'll wear my earrings.

255
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,270
I sometimes go there.

256
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,063
I went to send a wire
to Whit that I'd found her...

257
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:53,441
but the telegraph office
was closed for the siesta.

258
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,336
I was glad it was, and
I suddenly knew why.

259
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,538
I went to Pablo's that night.

260
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,915
I knew I'd go every night
until she showed up...

261
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,583
and I knew she knew it.

262
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,838
I sat there and drank bourbon,
and I shut my eyes...

263
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,924
but I didn't think of a
joint on 56th Street.

264
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:23,388
I knew where I was and what I was doing.
I just thought what a sucker I was.

265
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,474
I even knew she wouldn't
come the first night...

266
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:31,155
but I sat there, grinding it out.

267
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:41,281
But the next night
I knew she'd show.

268
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:44,033
She waited until it was late...

269
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:49,090
and then she walked in out
of the moonlight, smiling.

270
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:12,784
- Well, this is a coincidence.
- Yes, it is.

271
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:17,066
- American music.
- You know, I've been here for two nights.

272
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:20,403
- Thinking?
- No, just waiting.

273
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,405
I haven't been lonely.

274
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,200
- Bourbon?
- As you suggested.

275
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,629
Thank you, sir.

276
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,788
I've been sitting
here for three hours.

277
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:33,764
I thought the guy was gonna break
out with "Melancholy Baby."

278
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,045
You know, you're a curious man.

279
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:40,006
You're gonna make every guy you
meet a little bit curious.

280
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:43,593
That's not what I mean.
You don't ask questions.

281
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:46,638
You don't even ask
me what my name is.

282
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,349
All right, what's your name?

283
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,726
Kathie.

284
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:55,688
- I like it.
- Or where I come from.

285
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,066
I'm thinking about
where we're going.

286
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:01,653
- Don't you like it in here?
- I'm just not ready to settle down.

287
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,279
Shall I take you somewhere else?

288
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,782
You're gonna find it very
easy to take me anywhere.

289
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:10,714
You know, I'm a much better guide
than José Rodriguez. Wanna try me?

290
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,172
- That isn't the way to play.
- Why not?

291
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,591
- Because it isn't the way to win.
- Is there a way?

292
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,594
There's a way to lose more slowly.

293
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,558
- I prefer it like that.
- Chunk it in.

294
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:35,784
- Don't you like to gamble?
- Not against a wheel.

295
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:41,192
- Tell me why you're so hard to please.
- Take me where I can tell you.

296
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,819
All right, come on.

297
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,644
Wait a minute.

298
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,388
When are you taking me back?

299
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:40,895
- Is that why you kissed me?
- No.

300
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:44,255
Whit didn't die.

301
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,103
- He didn't?
- No.

302
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,152
- Then why...
- He just wants you back.

303
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,972
I hate him.

304
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:57,449
- I'm sorry he didn't die.
- Give him time.

305
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:03,107
- You are taking me back.
- There's no hurry.

306
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,194
I could have run away last night.

307
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:10,796
- I'd find you.
- Yes, I believe you would.

308
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:15,036
Are you glad you did?

309
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,760
I don't know.

310
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,722
I am.

311
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:24,963
- There was a little business about $40,000.
- I didn't take it.

312
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,757
How'd you know it was taken?

313
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:30,510
It's what you meant.

314
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:34,190
I don't want anything of
his or any part of him.

315
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,850
- Except his life.
- I didn't know what I was doing.

316
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:41,396
I didn't know anything,
except how much I hated him.

317
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:44,899
But I didn't take anything.

318
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,703
I didn't, Jeff.

319
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,447
Won't you believe me?

320
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,547
Baby, I don't care.

321
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:05,003
I never saw her in the daytime.
We seemed to live by night.

322
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:08,965
What was left of the day went away
like a pack of cigarettes you smoked.

323
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:11,718
I didn't know where she lived.
I never followed her.

324
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:15,555
All I ever had to go on was a
place and time to see her again.

325
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:19,225
I don't know what we were waiting for.
Maybe we thought the world would end.

326
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,019
Maybe we thought it was a dream...

327
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,604
and we'd wake up with a
hangover in Niagara Falls.

328
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,024
I wired Whit, but
I didn't tell him.

329
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,943
"I'm in Acapulco, " I said,
"I wish you were here."

330
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:32,238
And every night I went to meet her.

331
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:35,575
How did I know she'd
ever show up? I didn't.

332
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:39,996
What stopped her from taking a boat
to Chile or Guatemala? Nothing.

333
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:44,973
How big a chump can you
get to be? I was finding out.

334
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,547
And then she'd come along
like school was out...

335
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:53,551
and everything else was just a
stone you sailed at the sea.

336
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,512
- I didn't know you were so little.
- I'm taller than Napoleon.

337
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,941
You're prettier too.

338
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:04,062
- Did you miss me?
- No more than I would my eyes.

339
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:08,869
- Where should we go tonight?
- Let's go to my place.

340
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,365
It was the first time she had
mentioned her place or going there.

341
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:21,297
Maybe she'd decided something, or it was
because the sky looked full of rain.

342
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,931
It was a nice little joint with
bamboo furniture and Mexican gimcracks.

343
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,809
One little lamp burned.
It was all right.

344
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:47,021
And the rain hammering like that on the
window made it good to be in there.

345
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,165
Here.

346
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,586
Hey, hey, not so hard.

347
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,159
- Now yours.
- No, Joe, it's all right.

348
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,662
- Oh, come on.
- No, not so hard, Jeff. My earring.

349
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:06,433
Hush! I'm trying to dry your hair.

350
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:31,190
- Are you going with me?
- Where?

351
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:34,026
- Wherever it takes us.
- Why?

352
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:39,549
To make a life for ourselves, to get
away from Whit. He knows I'm here.

353
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:44,036
- When?
- Tomorrow.

354
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:48,499
Pack in the morning, meet me at
the hotel if you can make it.

355
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,461
- I can make it. Can we get away with it?
- Let's find out.

356
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:56,007
- You don't know Whit. He won't forget.
- Everybody forgets.

357
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,425
Not Whit.

358
00:27:57,426 --> 00:28:00,946
So we'll send him a
postcard every Christmas.

359
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,764
Jeff, I'm glad you're
not afraid of him.

360
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,559
I've been afraid of half
the things I ever did.

361
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:11,787
- And this time?
- I'm only afraid you might not go.

362
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:15,151
Don't be.

363
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:18,029
I'll be there tomorrow.

364
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,199
- Love me?
- Mm-hm.

365
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,035
- Poco?
- What's that?

366
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:27,590
- A little.
- Mucho.

367
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,148
- Well, the last guy in the world.
- I hate surprises myself.

368
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:58,204
- You wanna just shut the door and forget it?
- No, no. Come on in.

369
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:02,448
I like surprises. When I was
a kid, we were so busted...

370
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:05,868
that if we got anything at all for
Christmas it was a big surprise.

371
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,579
- Sit down, have a chair.
- Thanks.

372
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,303
- Been here long?
- Oh...

373
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:14,641
- How long, Joe?
- Hardly at all.

374
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,674
I just wondered who
might be following whom.

375
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:22,343
What makes you think that?

376
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:26,222
Look, I know how you trust people. About
as far as you can throw Stephanos here.

377
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:30,685
And that's all right with me, only
let's not get so cute about it.

378
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:35,787
I'm on my way to Mexico City,
see a man about a horse.

379
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:41,206
On the level. A racehorse
from South America.

380
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,158
- Checking out?
- Sure. Why waste your money?

381
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,635
- Did you find her?
- No, only her trail.

382
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:56,850
Not quite as hot as a prairie fire, but
there. Sometimes a little too obvious.

383
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,257
She's a clever little girl.

384
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:04,677
- Is she?
- Wouldn't you say so?

385
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:07,638
You should have told me, I would
have played it differently.

386
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,516
Maybe she wouldn't have
heard my shoes squeaking.

387
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:15,688
Always a hop, skip and a jump ahead
of me. Mexico City to Taxco to here.

388
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:20,443
- And here, Jeff, did you see her?
- No. I wish I had.

389
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:23,404
I don't like playing games
when I'm the fall guy.

390
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:24,780
You might remember that, Whit.

391
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,395
Thank you.

392
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:50,931
- Nice shoes. Sporty for you, aren't they?
- Yeah, I got them down here.

393
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:54,060
As I said before, I thought
maybe the others squeaked.

394
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:58,616
Let's go down to the bar. You can cool
off while we try to impress each other.

395
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,834
Fine.

396
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:09,700
Nice place. I'd like to
stay here a while myself.

397
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,470
You did, by proxy.

398
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:25,132
Something tall and cool,
I don't care what.

399
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,675
- Two.
- Make it three.

400
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,719
Certainly, sir.

401
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,889
- So you blew it.
- Anybody can have bad luck.

402
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,726
- And squeaky shoes.
- Think of a number, Joe.

403
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:40,106
- Where were you off to?
- The telegraph office to wire you.

404
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:43,581
I told you, I don't like
to spend your money.

405
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:48,419
- I can stand it.
- Well, it's your business.

406
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,785
Whit, my friend, there's a million dames
in this world, and they all look like her.

407
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:55,509
No, they don't.

408
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,541
So she was here.

409
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:02,002
Well, according to all
available evidence, she was.

410
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,630
Maybe I should've sent Stephanos.

411
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,883
- Could you find one dame in a million, Joe?
- A one with 40 grand.

412
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:16,142
Sorry.

413
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:17,518
You picked up some nerves.

414
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,604
I don't need a crack like that
any more than I need your dough.

415
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:25,818
That's what I've been telling you. I missed
her. The dame caught a boat south.

416
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:29,113
- Where?
- Look, I got along before this job.

417
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:33,284
I ate good, and I grew as big as you did. If
there's something you don't like, say so.

418
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:37,621
- I just asked where.
- Chile. Guatemala.

419
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:41,625
You wanna go see the guy in the steamship
company? You wanna talk to him right now?

420
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,928
Why not?

421
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,240
- Taxi, sir?
- Yeah.

422
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:59,977
I'm sorry. You missed
her and you feel bad.

423
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,780
I shouldn't have joked about it.

424
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,522
All right, then I won't either.

425
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:07,026
You get your 5 grand back and
Stephanos can take over from here.

426
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:08,777
You're wrong.

427
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,697
I fire people, but nobody quits me.

428
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,376
You started this and you'll end it.

429
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:17,995
Besides, Joe couldn't find
a prayer in the Bible.

430
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,414
You'll find her. Take it easy.

431
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:23,792
Take your time. Well, better
get back to the airport.

432
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,336
Good luck, Jeff.

433
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,264
See you someday.

434
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,847
It wasn't all a lie
because she did take a steamer.

435
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,600
It was just that it went
north instead of south.

436
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,949
And I was on it too.

437
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:45,448
I opened an office
in San Francisco.

438
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:49,151
A cheap little rat hole
that suited the work I did.

439
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:52,196
Shabby jobs for who'd ever hire me.

440
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:57,048
It was the bottom of the barrel,
and I scraped it, but I didn't care.

441
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,512
I had her.

442
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,331
We kept pretty much to ourselves.

443
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:04,959
We found a little movie
house in North Beach.

444
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,629
We were on the run. We went to places
we never would've seen in our lives.

445
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,507
And after a while, we grew a
little more sure of ourselves.

446
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:16,095
We drifted back to more familiar
places, ballparks and the racetracks.

447
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:21,402
Why not? After all, there wasn't one chance
in a million we'd bump into our past.

448
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,826
One chance in a million.

449
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:30,693
One chance in a million was all that chump
ever had in his life, and he made it good.

450
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:34,363
He stood there with our lives in his
pocket, because I knew if he saw her...

451
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:37,417
he'd sell us both for $1.95.

452
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,965
So we had to separate.

453
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:45,082
I went alone to L.A., and I made
it easy for him to follow me.

454
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:49,104
He was a good gumshoe. It was the
one thing he could really do.

455
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:51,880
So I went everywhere like a
guy enjoying the country.

456
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,717
I didn't write to her
or phone or telegraph.

457
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:56,927
I just waited and moved.

458
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:00,347
When it seemed right, I blew out
of town to go and meet her.

459
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:04,824
I wasn't bad at the game myself. I was sure
I had shaken him loose, and I felt good.

460
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:14,997
Fisher was back there somewhere,
and I could see her again.

461
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:19,491
We'd arranged to meet at a little cabin
off the highway on Pyramid Creek.

462
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,869
It was dark when I
was getting there.

463
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,923
And then I saw her walking up
the road in the headlights.

464
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:34,934
- You want a lift, babe?
- Well, I really hadn't ought.

465
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,428
You're a cute little package
to be out walking alone at night.

466
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:42,306
You're kind of cute yourself
to be walking alone any night.

467
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:43,984
That does it.

468
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:52,232
It was meeting her
somewhere, like in the first times.

469
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,943
There was still that something
about her that got me.

470
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,417
A kind of magic or whatever it was.

471
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:01,756
Well, I held her, and we could laugh
because we were together again.

472
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:05,134
We'd played it smart
and forgotten nothing.

473
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:07,873
Forgotten nothing except one thing.

474
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,885
He had followed her.

475
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,483
Hello, Jeff.

476
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,162
Don't I get introduced?

477
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,955
I don't blame you, Jeff.

478
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,957
Maybe I'd have lied my head
off just like you did.

479
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:44,302
Your picture don't do
you justice, baby.

480
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:48,414
- Why don't you break his head, Jeff?
- Cute.

481
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:51,917
Whit should've got her back. As I
understand, they deserve each other.

482
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:55,546
- You working for him now?
- Who else would he get to find my partner?

483
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,020
All right, Fisher,
what's the pitch?

484
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,884
You and I had a little deal, Jeff.

485
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,304
Ten grand and expenses,
fifty-fifty.

486
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,808
Remember? You used to have a good
memory. Whatever happened to it?

487
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:10,227
- I didn't collect.
- Not the 10 grand.

488
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:14,356
I can give you a tip. You tell Whit where
we are, he might slip you a sawbuck.

489
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,954
Jeff.

490
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,068
He isn't going to
tell Whit anything.

491
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:22,656
Sure not. You just come up with that
40 grand, and we're all pals again.

492
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:26,493
- I might even cut you in for a piece of it.
- There isn't any 40 grand.

493
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,495
Of course Whit's broad-minded.

494
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,914
He don't care about a few
slugs in the stomach...

495
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,217
or the 40 grand the
dame went off with...

496
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:36,225
or even Jeff pretending
he fell down on the job.

497
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:40,924
But you and Jeff ganging up
together, he might not like that.

498
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,273
Tell him, Kathie.

499
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,596
Sure, I shot him.

500
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,570
I'm not sorry about that.

501
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,571
But I didn't take his money.

502
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,936
- Beat it.
- Look at all the angles.

503
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,689
You know Whit and you know
how far he can reach.

504
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,401
So just pay me off and
I'm quiet, but use cash.

505
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:03,752
Don't try to pay me off with pitch handed
to you by this cheap piece of baggage.

506
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,876
I was hoping you'd do this.

507
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:47,300
- You didn't have to kill him.
- Yes, I did.

508
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:51,453
You wouldn't have killed him. You would've
beaten him up and thrown him out.

509
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,553
- You didn't have to do it.
- You wouldn't have killed him.

510
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:58,769
He'd have been against
us, gone to Whit.

511
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,885
I buried him up there.

512
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:41,628
I wasn't sorry for
him or sore at her.

513
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,476
I wasn't anything.

514
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,769
- Did you ever see her again?
- No.

515
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,529
Did you want to?

516
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:53,111
No.

517
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,985
Well, I told you
it wasn't a nice story.

518
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:07,630
And I said once that whatever
had happened was done.

519
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:10,198
Yeah, but you should've
known about it long ago.

520
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,784
It's all right. I understand.

521
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,578
And it's all past.

522
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,204
Maybe it isn't.

523
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,582
- What'll happen?
- I don't know.

524
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:21,501
It's been a long time. I don't
know how much he knows.

525
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,920
Don't go, Jeff.

526
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:27,174
I've got to. I'm tired of running.
I gotta clean this up some way.

527
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,176
Just one thing, Ann.

528
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:30,761
Do you want me to come back?

529
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,609
Of course.

530
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,951
Put that in your pocket.

531
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,157
Look who's here.

532
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:22,062
Hello, Markham. Glad
to see you again.

533
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,147
I always wondered if you missed me.

534
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,733
Ah. Same guy. Time-proof,
weatherproof.

535
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,128
- Cigarette?
- Smoking.

536
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,201
- Thanks. Had breakfast?
- No.

537
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,620
Joe, tell the boy we have a guest.

538
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,790
Say, I understand you're operating
a little gasoline station.

539
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:44,543
- You say it like it's hard to understand.
- Well, it is.

540
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:48,088
It's very simple. I sell gasoline.
I make a small profit.

541
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:51,008
With that I buy groceries,
the grocer makes a profit.

542
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:54,594
They call it earning a living.
You may have heard of it somewhere.

543
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,889
I may have, but it wasn't from you.

544
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,684
- I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, Whit.
- My feelings?

545
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:04,354
Ten years ago, I hid them somewhere
and I haven't been able to find them.

546
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,064
Where did you look?

547
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,242
In my pocketbook.

548
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,861
Nice, isn't it?

549
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,836
Yeah, it must have set
you back a few shells.

550
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:17,075
Always worrying about my expenses.

551
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,202
It's a nice view.
Am I here to admire it?

552
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,096
Not exactly.

553
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:23,165
I need your help.

554
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,708
Like old times.

555
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:27,137
I always liked you.

556
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:31,006
You liked me because you could use me.
You could use me because I was smart.

557
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:33,216
I'm not smart anymore.
I run a gas station.

558
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,010
I like the view.

559
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:36,887
Can you still listen?

560
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,638
I can hear.

561
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,599
Well, you told me
about your business.

562
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,603
Well, mine is a little more precarious,
and I earn considerably more.

563
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:46,021
So I've heard.

564
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:47,856
So has the government.

565
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:50,942
Well, this may sound ridiculous,
but you could pay them.

566
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:54,029
- That would be against my nature.
- All right, forget I said it.

567
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:58,617
So I collaborated with a certain
man who understands these things.

568
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:00,994
He saved me quite a bit
of money, $1 million.

569
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:05,624
I didn't particularly trust him, so
I paid him well, but he's unhappy.

570
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:08,543
- He wants more money.
- Well, he saved you a lot.

571
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:12,422
Oh, I appreciate it. I always
remember what any man did for me.

572
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,840
Or didn't.

573
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:17,969
Perhaps. The point is that
now he wants 200,000.

574
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,932
Or he could get 10 percent of the million
from the government, if he turns you in.

575
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,892
You're up on these things.

576
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:27,729
- Has he got anything to trade?
- Well, he has the income tax records.

577
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:31,900
But I don't see why I should buy them
when I might persuade you to get them.

578
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:33,777
- Then I'd have them.
- I know.

579
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,403
But I can trust you.

580
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,948
You know, I don't think
you can trust anybody.

581
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,450
You better go in there
and get them yourself.

582
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,078
- I'd rather you did it.
- I pass.

583
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:44,496
You don't like it?

584
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:47,207
No, I just can't get
away from my business.

585
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,668
Well, it's a nice view.

586
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,767
Let's have some breakfast.

587
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:01,151
You remember Kathie, don't you?

588
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,659
Yeah, I remember Kathie.

589
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:09,354
Sit down.

590
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:12,190
Kathie's back in the fold now.

591
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:15,694
- You're back in the fold too, Jeff.
- I see what you mean.

592
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:18,113
You see, Jeff, you
owe me something.

593
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:20,633
You'll never be happy until
you square yourself.

594
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,669
Did you bare your
heart to him, Kathie?

595
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,888
I couldn't help it, Jeff.

596
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,250
- Well, that settles things.
- Does it?

597
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:32,085
You're working for me.

598
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,838
This man I told you about,
his name is Leonard Eels...

599
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,798
but, uh, you won't
go to him directly.

600
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:39,342
He has a secretary that
he's rather fond of.

601
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,387
Her name is Meta Carson.
You'll find her charming.

602
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,531
She may even find you charming.

603
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,017
I understand that women have.

604
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,412
She'll tell you how it's lined up.

605
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,282
You, uh, know San
Francisco, don't you?

606
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:56,443
Yeah, I was there once at a party.

607
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,213
- Then you get around.
- Like the monkey and the weasel.

608
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,550
We'll put you on a
train this afternoon.

609
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:07,305
- Right now, I'd like to get some sleep.
- Find Joe. He'll show you to your room.

610
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:10,665
And don't start worrying.

611
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,639
Why should I?

612
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:38,536
Jeff, I had to come back.
What else could I do?

613
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:41,196
You can never help
anything, can you?

614
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:45,627
You're like a leaf that the wind
blows from one gutter to another.

615
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,079
You can't help anything
you do, even murder.

616
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,332
- You can't say it was that.
- I can say one thing. I buried him.

617
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:55,762
- What did you tell him? About us?
- Uh...

618
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:01,800
- But you couldn't help it, could you?
- He looked right into me and he knew it.

619
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:03,843
- How much?
- What, Jeff?

620
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,263
About Fisher. Did he look
into you for that too?

621
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:08,441
No, I didn't tell that.

622
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:11,142
- Don't lie to me.
- I didn't.

623
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:14,187
I wouldn't tell him that.
I wouldn't tell anyone that.

624
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,439
I swear it, Jeff. Believe me.

625
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,608
Sure. Sure, I believe you.

626
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,610
I didn't know what to do.

627
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,446
I was always afraid of him
and afraid of what I'd done.

628
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:26,533
I couldn't live that way
anymore. I couldn't stand it.

629
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:28,618
Oh, Jeff, I've missed you.

630
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:32,122
I've wondered about you and
prayed you'd understand.

631
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:33,540
Can you understand?

632
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,343
You prayed, Kathie?

633
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:37,644
Can't you even feel sorry for me?

634
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,171
- I'm not going to try.
- Jeff...

635
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:43,521
Look, just get out, will you?
I have to sleep in this room.

636
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:49,865
Let's just leave it where
it all is. Get out.

637
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,730
- Meta Carson?
- Yes.

638
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:41,784
- My name is Bailey.
- Come in.

639
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:47,864
- I was expecting you.
- Well, I wasn't expecting you.

640
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:51,201
- Should I take that as a compliment?
- Whit told me you'd be charming.

641
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:53,578
Really? Would you
like a gin and tonic?

642
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,122
- That'd be nice.
- You may have whiskey, if you like.

643
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,425
That'd be even nicer.

644
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:04,728
Miserable weather
we're having, isn't it?

645
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:09,688
- Are you acquainted with San Francisco?
- We were quite intimate.

646
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:12,680
- Indeed?
- We lived together.

647
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,516
It's a nice apartment
you have here.

648
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:18,061
Yes, these old houses can be amusing
when they're remodeled, can't they?

649
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:20,688
I used to live in one in
New York that was old.

650
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,357
It wasn't very amusing.

651
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:26,027
- I've never been to New York.
- You take a trip there sometime.

652
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:28,947
You'll see one reason why
I'm in San Francisco.

653
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:30,698
Whit said you'd tell me the other.

654
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:34,911
You know, you're rather charming yourself,
but I'm afraid I don't quite understand you.

655
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,038
If you'll drop this
Junior League patter...

656
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:39,762
we may get the conversation
down where it belongs.

657
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:43,336
- You worried about something?
- I don't know. Should I be?

658
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:47,507
- Not if you do what you're told.
- That's why I'm here. I do what I'm told.

659
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:51,553
People trust me. Whit even
trusts me twice. Do you?

660
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:54,152
Just as far as I have to.

661
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:57,851
Can you find your way
to 114 Fulton Street?

662
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:59,853
- When?
- Tonight.

663
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:03,356
I'll be there in the apartment of
an attorney named Leonard Eels.

664
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:06,025
You can call for me
at 8 and look around.

665
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:09,362
I can depend on that.
We'll leave together.

666
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,865
In a day or so, he'll
take some papers home.

667
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:13,366
I'll let you know.

668
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,702
Then you get them.
He won't be there.

669
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:17,203
Where will he be?

670
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:20,665
With me. I'm his secretary.

671
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:24,085
- Well, it sounds simple enough.
- It is.

672
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:27,356
- Like two and two make four.
- That's right.

673
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:35,280
Just remember, I'm coming out of
this in one piece, Miss Carson.

674
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:39,058
Do you always go around leaving your
fingerprints on a girl's shoulder?

675
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:44,115
Not that I mind particularly.
You've got nice strong hands.

676
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:01,706
- Jeff.
- Petey, how are you?

677
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,750
Where you been? You
marry an honest dame?

678
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:07,420
- I went in the gasoline business.
- But you're looking for me now, ain't you?

679
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,975
I went out of business. Come on,
let's take a ride in your hack.

680
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,096
Buddy, you look like
you're in trouble.

681
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:20,276
- Why?
- Because you don't act like it.

682
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:23,071
I think I'm in a frame.

683
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:25,188
Don't sound like you.

684
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:27,732
I don't know. All I
can see is the frame.

685
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,068
I'm going in there now
to look at the picture.

686
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:33,873
- I don't have to tell you to wait.
- You don't have to tell me nothing.

687
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:04,769
My name is Jeff Bailey.

688
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,814
Oh, yes, Miss Carson said you'd
pick her up. I'm Leonard Eels.

689
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:10,618
- How do you do?
- Bring him out here, Leonard.

690
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:18,616
Thank you.

691
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,410
Hello, Jeffrey.

692
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:23,371
I always wanted my favorite
cousin to meet my favorite boss.

693
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:25,373
- Apple martini?
- Thanks.

694
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:28,501
Meta talked about you like you're
the ninth wonder of the world.

695
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,753
- She skipped one.
- Meta must be the eighth.

696
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:34,716
All women are wonders because they
reduce all men to the obvious.

697
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:36,940
And so do martinis.

698
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:40,013
So nice here, I hate to go.

699
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:42,942
Don't then. Why don't you
both stay and have dinner?

700
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,517
Yes, why don't we?

701
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:47,604
We can't, Jeffrey. We promised
the Bigelows, remember?

702
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:49,897
Oh, call them up.
We can see them anytime.

703
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:52,066
We can't, Jeffrey.
I'm sorry, Leonard.

704
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:55,120
Some other time. How long will
you be in town, Mr. Bailey?

705
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:58,448
- I don't really know.
- You're on business?

706
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:01,753
- You might call it that.
- Where are you from? The South?

707
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:06,414
- No. Tahoe.
- We must go, Jeff.

708
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:08,388
All right.

709
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:14,339
Your, uh, cousin is a
very charming young lady.

710
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:18,611
No, he isn't. His name is Norman and
he's a bookmaker in Cleveland, Ohio.

711
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:23,556
- Where did you say you were from?
- Tahoe...

712
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:26,861
where we worry as much about
the income tax as anybody.

713
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,063
Frankly, you don't make sense.

714
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:32,440
Neither does my being her cousin...

715
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:34,859
or my being brought up here...

716
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,986
to, uh, leave my
fingerprints around.

717
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,030
On the other hand, maybe it does.

718
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:42,200
You know, it could be that I'm the
patsy, and you're on the spot.

719
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:44,869
- Coming, Jeff?
- Right away.

720
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:47,969
Keep the martinis
dry, I'll be back.

721
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,463
I'm glad you could
come, both of you.

722
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:57,882
- Mr. Eels, you make a great martini.
- Thank you.

723
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,300
- Good night.
- Good night.

724
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,979
- Good night, Leonard.
- Good night.

725
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:11,521
For a man who appears to be
clever, you can act like an idiot.

726
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:14,917
That's one way to be
Look like an idiot.

727
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:19,195
He looked like an underweight
ghost. What did you say to him?

728
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,197
I told him he made a great martini.

729
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,408
- You are an idiot.
- So is he.

730
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:27,134
- You think so?
- Why not? He's in love with you.

731
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:34,353
Mason Building.

732
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:42,385
Doesn't your conscience bother
you, crossing a nice guy like that?

733
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:44,345
Maybe he isn't such a nice guy.

734
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,489
Maybe he crosses people too.

735
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:56,232
- Do I go alone?
- No, you go back to your hotel and wait.

736
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,456
Yes, ma'am.

737
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:06,242
- Nice.
- Awfully cold around the heart. Let's go.

738
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,869
Hold it.

739
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:10,844
Drive around the block
and stop right here.

740
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:02,191
Follow her, Petey, then wait for
me at Eels' apartment house.

741
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:49,465
- I lost her.
- She's worth losing.

742
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:53,636
I jumped a signal and I got
stopped by a gabby cop.

743
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:56,406
Here. You finish it.

744
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:59,141
- Shall I pick up her hack?
- No.

745
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:02,186
- Where to?
- Telegraph Hill.

746
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,938
Did you have some bad luck?

747
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:07,288
Yeah. My timing was
a few minutes off.

748
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:39,366
- Hello?
- Mr. Tillotson.

749
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,911
- Yes.
- This is Mr. Eels' secretary.

750
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:43,746
I'm worried about Mr. Eels.

751
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:46,207
I know he's home, but he
doesn't answer his phone.

752
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:48,834
- Would you see if he's all right?
- Maybe he went out.

753
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,753
No, he was to wait for my call.

754
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:55,216
I don't want to be a nuisance, but
I'm sure he's there and I'm worried.

755
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:57,676
- Would you call me right back?
- Yes.

756
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:00,054
Fillmore 0710.

757
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:03,529
- Yes, Miss Carson. Right away.
- Thank you.

758
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:39,343
- Yes?
- He isn't there.

759
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:41,237
He isn't?

760
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,305
- Did you go in the apartment?
- Yes.

761
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,779
But he must be there.

762
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:47,944
Thank you.

763
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,866
- Hello?
- Joe Stephanos, please.

764
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:03,284
He isn't here.

765
01:01:03,285 --> 01:01:07,010
Then leave word for him to call
Miss Carson's apartment right away.

766
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:13,724
Was there a slip-up, baby?

767
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:20,176
Did you send your friend up
there to find Eels dead?

768
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:23,105
- No, Jeff.
- Tell me.

769
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:25,222
- Tell me.
- Don't, Jeff.

770
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:27,183
- Don't what?
- I don't want to die.

771
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:30,352
Neither do I, baby. But if I
have to, I'm gonna die last.

772
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,979
Something slipped up, didn't it?

773
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:35,274
They told you they'd knock him off,
and haven't done it, have they?

774
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:38,360
They haven't because I
tipped him off. He blew.

775
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,529
- He's all right?
- Didn't you want him to be?

776
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:44,175
Yes. Yes, because if he
dies, they'll say you did it.

777
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:47,036
Oh, you're wonderful, Kathie.
You're magnificent.

778
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:51,342
- You can change sides so smoothly.
- Don't, Jeff. You're hurting me.

779
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:54,168
I'm almost getting it.

780
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:56,003
Very pretty.

781
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:59,340
Whit wants Eels out of the picture
and to square an account with me.

782
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:02,176
Two birds together. So I come
to town with an address.

783
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:05,012
A redhead takes me up to visit
the chump who has to go.

784
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:07,431
I have a drink, leave
my prints around.

785
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:09,391
I leave and somebody gets him.

786
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,852
Eels dies and the tax papers...

787
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:14,688
they were in the briefcase
that Meta took, weren't they?

788
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:17,566
The papers go back to
Whit. I'm the fall guy.

789
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,276
There's only one thing missing:

790
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:20,861
The plant.

791
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:24,865
What was there to give me a motive? I
wouldn't kill a guy for a martini.

792
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:26,867
- Tell me, Kathie.
- They made me sign it.

793
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:28,661
- Sign what?
- An affidavit.

794
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:30,537
- Go on.
- I couldn't help it, Jeff.

795
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:33,374
They made me sign it.
I swear I couldn't help it.

796
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:36,502
They said they'd find the body
and tell the police I killed him.

797
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:39,338
Fisher. Then you did
tell them about Fisher.

798
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:41,423
Only you told them I did it.

799
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,192
Perfect.

800
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:45,469
Foolproof and beautiful.

801
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:47,304
That Whit can really
hate, can't he?

802
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,515
You said it once, he can remember.

803
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:51,850
I never stopped hating him, Jeff.

804
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:54,353
I couldn't help myself.
I was caught too.

805
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:56,563
We don't have to be
against each other now.

806
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:58,857
- Aren't we?
- No. We can break out of it.

807
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,609
All we need is the briefcase.

808
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:04,363
Then we've got them, Jeff. We can
get anything we want from them.

809
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:06,240
I'd like that affidavit you signed.

810
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:08,993
We can get it. It's
in Eels' office safe.

811
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:12,538
We can make Meta get it.
We can make them do anything.

812
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:14,248
Sure.

813
01:03:14,249 --> 01:03:15,708
Oh, Jeff...

814
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:18,127
You ought to have killed
me for what I did.

815
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:21,297
- There's time.
- No. You won't.

816
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:23,382
I've never stopped loving you.

817
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:26,593
I was afraid and no good,
but I never stopped...

818
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:28,721
even if you hated me.

819
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:30,139
Did you?

820
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:33,785
- Yes.
- But you don't now.

821
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,163
No.

822
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,523
We can be together again.

823
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:42,985
In a way we never were.
We can go back to Acapulco...

824
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:46,030
and start all over as though
nothing had happened.

825
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:48,004
Yes.

826
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:56,040
How do we get the briefcase?

827
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:57,708
Whit owns a club.

828
01:03:57,709 --> 01:03:59,793
The Sterling Club on North Beach.

829
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:03,172
Meta took it there to
a man named Baylord.

830
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:05,007
I might get by with it.

831
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:06,675
You will, darling.

832
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:09,608
Hurry.

833
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:32,534
What happened to you?

834
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:35,287
I went to a bar and bought a
double. I must be slipping.

835
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:37,247
I guess you must be.

836
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:42,086
He just stood there shaking so
hard he couldn't even pray.

837
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:45,464
I never saw anyone
so afraid to die.

838
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:47,984
- I didn't like it.
- You killed him?

839
01:04:49,052 --> 01:04:51,025
Certainly.

840
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:55,450
But I called. A man went up and looked
in the apartment and he wasn't there.

841
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:59,228
- Eels?
- Yes, Eels. He wasn't there.

842
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:02,373
I was there. And the way I
left him, he didn't walk away.

843
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:06,369
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

844
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,957
I do. Where's Bailey?

845
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:56,201
What do you want?

846
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:02,291
- Yeah?
- Mr. Baylord, a man just went up...

847
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:05,141
- heading toward your office.
- Forget it.

848
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:42,511
- You wanted to see somebody?
- I just saw him. Thanks.

849
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,944
- You know that hack driver?
- Yeah, I think so.

850
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:14,029
- Rafferty.
- Yeah?

851
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:17,199
Get Joe. Bring back that
guy any way you have to.

852
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,549
- Just so that briefcase comes with him.
- Right.

853
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:26,500
- All arranged, sir.
- Twenty for you, the rest for transportation.

854
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:29,336
Have the boy meet me at
the airport with the ticket.

855
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:32,923
- Thank you, sir.
- You know, a bad memory is like an ill wind.

856
01:07:32,924 --> 01:07:37,604
- It can blow somebody luck.
- I always say everybody's right.

857
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,788
After you.

858
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:52,109
- You won't need this.
- I couldn't do nothing.

859
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:53,902
You can now. Start moving.

860
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:58,458
- I sure get into a lot of trouble, don't I?
- You shouldn't steal so much.

861
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:11,722
Well, we meet in all
kinds of places.

862
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:20,679
That evens this. Fold your
hands, or I'll do it for you.

863
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,108
You talk big, mister.

864
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:35,360
- All right, wise guy.
- I wouldn't.

865
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:37,696
I told you. I'm tired of
getting pushed around.

866
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:40,824
You'll only get yourself out
of breath. Won't he, Joe?

867
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:42,409
Cut it, Lou.

868
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:45,704
Your move now is to do a little
thinking. A little talking.

869
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:48,999
See, I've got the files that
were in your briefcase.

870
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,585
I also know the address of
the Treasury Department.

871
01:08:51,586 --> 01:08:55,088
That's the theory, isn't it? Keep the
files away from the treasury boys.

872
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:57,507
Save Whit from doing 10
years in a federal pen.

873
01:08:57,508 --> 01:09:01,345
- Now, you correct me if I make a mistake.
- We may do that.

874
01:09:01,346 --> 01:09:05,140
Sure. Of course, the government may
just pat Whit on the back and say:

875
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:09,144
"Go on home. We got all the dough we need.
We'll never miss your million dollars."

876
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,605
You wanna lay a price on that?

877
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:13,658
How did you know I
had the briefcase?

878
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:17,361
I had Meta tailed.

879
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:20,322
You sure about that?

880
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:23,909
Look, I don't have to be sure
about anything except the files.

881
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:27,430
Now, do you wanna talk business,
or do you wanna play house?

882
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,165
What's your idea?

883
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:33,335
You get the files, and you
also get Eels' body...

884
01:09:33,336 --> 01:09:35,796
in case you wanna keep
it from the cops.

885
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:37,940
What do you want?

886
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:42,612
I want the affidavit that Meta put in
Eels' safe when she took the files out.

887
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:47,491
A lie that somebody put on paper that
I killed a guy named Jack Fisher.

888
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,777
Because, you see,
I only buried him.

889
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:52,655
And you don't get the gas
for being the undertaker.

890
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:56,024
Four of us knew about that
affidavit outside of Whit.

891
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:58,077
Somebody talked.

892
01:10:04,075 --> 01:10:07,128
- Did Meta tell you?
- No.

893
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:09,589
Sorry.

894
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,750
- Put in a call for Whit Sterling...
- No, sit down.

895
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:16,962
- We better keep Whit out of this.
- He's right, Kathie.

896
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:20,799
Oh, you've hurt her feelings, Lou.
I can tell you, she's a sensitive girl.

897
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,885
- I'm kind of sensitive myself.
- And you won't need Whit.

898
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:27,347
All you'll need is Meta to unlock
that safe in Eels' office.

899
01:10:27,348 --> 01:10:30,225
- I hope Meta's still around.
- She's around.

900
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:32,853
Good. Then you can start right now.

901
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:36,982
I'll call you in about an hour. That'll
give you time to find her and get there.

902
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:40,402
Give you a little extra time to
figure out how you're gonna cross me.

903
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:42,455
But you won't.

904
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:36,166
Will you bust this for me, Jackson?

905
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:38,014
Sure.

906
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:43,715
That's right. Whit Sterling
at the Blue Sky Club in Reno.

907
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:47,771
- Shut the door.
- Don't forget, those dames listen in.

908
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:54,351
- Hello?
- Mr. Sterling?

909
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:55,727
- Speaking.
- One moment.

910
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:58,522
- Thank you.
- Go ahead.

911
01:11:58,523 --> 01:12:01,691
- Whit, darling, this is Kathie.
- Everything all right?

912
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:03,735
- No.
- Seldom is.

913
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:06,363
I think you'd better stay
where you are for a while.

914
01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:09,366
- Well, could you tell me why?
- I can't talk now.

915
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:11,201
Things are mixed up.

916
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:12,911
Bailey mix them?

917
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:15,580
I can't talk on the phone.
We're trying to get a plane.

918
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:17,833
But you're bringing me something?

919
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:22,295
No, Whit. I can't explain now,
darling. I just wanted to tell you.

920
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:25,006
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

921
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:27,676
- Like what, honey?
- Don't go to Tahoe.

922
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:31,402
Be careful and wait in
Reno for me. Goodbye.

923
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:42,649
- You look like I might be in trouble.
- You will be if we don't find Bailey.

924
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:45,373
I might be if I do.

925
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:17,517
"Bridgeport service station operator
sought in San Francisco slaying.

926
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:20,520
Five-year-old murder
motive, the police say.

927
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:23,982
Leonard Eels, attorney, was found
murdered in his apartment house...

928
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:27,736
114 Fulton Street, early
this morning." Well.

929
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:31,239
"Jeff Bailey, at one time private
detective and more recently...

930
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,409
operator of a small gas
station in Bridgeport...

931
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:38,371
- is hunted for two murders."
- I knew he was no good.

932
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:42,208
I said all along, "There's a man
who should be run out of town."

933
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:46,421
Look at that. Police are
hunting him for two murders.

934
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:49,507
- I told you, Ann.
- Ann.

935
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:52,277
Oh, leave me alone.

936
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:04,230
Cooper reporting. Road is now blocked
20 miles south of Bridgeport.

937
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:06,691
Checking all cars. That is all.

938
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:09,861
- Hi, Jim.
- Hello, Ed. You talked to the kid yet?

939
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:12,238
He's gone. The station's
locked up tight.

940
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:15,700
- Gone where?
- Maybe with Bailey.

941
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:18,870
Well, that doesn't make sense.
If you had the law on your tail...

942
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:21,915
would you let a guy working for
you come up to chew the fat?

943
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:25,470
I'd want a partner,
if I could get him.

944
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:28,672
- Ed?
- Yeah?

945
01:14:28,673 --> 01:14:30,256
Our attention.

946
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:34,094
Says, "Bailey took a plane to L.A.
last night. No trace since."

947
01:14:34,095 --> 01:14:36,179
Says, "May be headed this way."

948
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:37,948
Okay.

949
01:14:38,057 --> 01:14:42,282
Would you consider it too dumb
for him to try to hole up here?

950
01:14:42,353 --> 01:14:45,105
He'll come here. And when
he does, I'll know it.

951
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:47,249
See you.

952
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:56,032
- What's he mean, he'll know it?
- What do you suppose? Ann Miller.

953
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:59,337
Me? I'll take the kid.

954
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,975
You all right, Ann?

955
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:16,771
I know what you're going to say,
and I don't wanna hear it.

956
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:19,556
Jeff didn't kill anybody.

957
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:21,359
He told me everything.

958
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:24,112
Has he got you mixed up in this?

959
01:15:24,145 --> 01:15:27,564
- Has he?
- Whatever he's mixed up in, I am too.

960
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:30,191
Well, I'm not going to stand
by and see him hurt you.

961
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,819
- If he comes back here...
- What'll you do?

962
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:35,613
- You won't go to the police.
- I don't know what I'll do.

963
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:37,115
No, Jimmy.

964
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:40,215
Do you expect me to
help him get away?

965
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:42,509
Jim.

966
01:15:49,837 --> 01:15:52,435
He can read your lips.

967
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:56,843
Mr. Sterling is fishing.

968
01:15:56,844 --> 01:15:59,512
No. In the high mountains.

969
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:02,015
Tell Jeff we're sending for him.

970
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:04,489
Where can we reach you?

971
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:16,293
Joe will find you at the
station when we have word.

972
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:29,292
I'm not so sure this
is a bright idea.

973
01:16:29,293 --> 01:16:32,597
You think of a brighter one on
the way, come back with it.

974
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:24,365
He follow you from Tahoe?

975
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:26,618
Who'd you see? Sterling?

976
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:28,717
Kathie?

977
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:35,056
Cute kids, aren't they?

978
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:07,129
What are you scared about?

979
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:12,048
Joe isn't coming back. He got
careless and fell in the river.

980
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:16,209
Didn't you hear what I said?
Joe's dead, Kathie.

981
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:19,229
Can't you find some tears for him?

982
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:23,174
- Come on.
- What are you gonna do?

983
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:25,426
Talk to Whit. Don't
you think I should?

984
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:29,138
Yes, of course you should. He wants
to see you. He's waiting for you.

985
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:32,100
With his fishing rod? You
told the kid he was fishing.

986
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:34,852
He, uh, came back
late this afternoon.

987
01:19:34,853 --> 01:19:37,480
I'll bet he's pacing up and
down, worrying about Joe.

988
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:42,318
- You think I sent Joe?
- Oh, you're wonderful, Kathie.

989
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:46,406
- All right. Where is the gentleman?
- Downstairs. In the library, I think.

990
01:19:46,407 --> 01:19:49,284
Jeff, don't let him trick you.

991
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:51,911
He'll pay anything you ask.
He'll do anything you ask.

992
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:54,886
Sure he will. Anything.

993
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:02,297
If only there was some
way about Fisher.

994
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:04,396
There is.

995
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:19,564
Well, you getting things in
shape for the treasury boys?

996
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:23,460
Hello, Jeff. I've been
sort of expecting you.

997
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:27,363
Well, let's get down to business.
Start all over again, right?

998
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:31,117
- You have some papers of mine.
- All right, you take the frame off me.

999
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:33,637
You pin the Eels murder on Joe.

1000
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:37,599
Sure. Sure.

1001
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:40,668
I get a modest settlement. Say...

1002
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:42,670
Oh, say 50,000.

1003
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:46,396
That should be enough for me to
spend my waning years in Mazatlán.

1004
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:49,844
Not Acapulco because I'd keep
thinking about you, Kathie.

1005
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:52,847
Up there in the women's
prison in Tehachapi.

1006
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:56,243
It won't be too bad. Hills all
around you, plenty of sun.

1007
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:59,645
You make me nervous.

1008
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:04,067
You'll be happier if you let the cops
have her. That's what you'll have to do.

1009
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:08,196
Somebody's gotta take the rap for
Fisher's murder. It's not gonna be me.

1010
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:10,198
Wait a minute.

1011
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:13,719
- I'm not framing any woman.
- When did you reform?

1012
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:16,718
I wouldn't try it, Whit.
You're out of shape.

1013
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:20,375
- Besides, it's not a frame. She shot him.
- He was gonna kill you.

1014
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:24,462
See, Whit? Self-defense. A cinch to beat.
She might not even have to do time.

1015
01:21:24,463 --> 01:21:28,609
- I'll say you killed him. They'll believe me.
- Do you believe her?

1016
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:32,817
Go on, Kathie, tell him about Joe.

1017
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:35,014
What about Joe? Where is he?

1018
01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:37,934
Last time I saw him, he was
in the East Walker River.

1019
01:21:37,935 --> 01:21:41,660
I didn't send him after Jeff.
It was his own idea.

1020
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:46,943
- Did you kill him?
- He slipped and fell.

1021
01:21:46,944 --> 01:21:50,696
When I got there, it was too
late. That's a mean river.

1022
01:21:50,697 --> 01:21:52,115
He was trailing you?

1023
01:21:52,116 --> 01:21:54,700
Well, you don't go fishing
with a .45 in your hand.

1024
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:57,453
But stop worrying about it.
It makes everything simple.

1025
01:21:57,454 --> 01:22:01,374
A dead man? Fish him out. Stick
a note in his pocket. Suicide.

1026
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:04,627
He couldn't stand living
with what he had done.

1027
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:08,148
Don't look so stricken, Whit.
You'll get over it. I did.

1028
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:11,773
But you talk it out if you want
to. I'll be waiting in there.

1029
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:13,678
Oh, one thing, Kathie:

1030
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:17,014
Did it take much persuasion to
make you say I killed Fisher?

1031
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:21,227
Come on. Feed my ego.
Tell me he beat you.

1032
01:22:21,228 --> 01:22:24,577
Tell me he had to drag
every word out of you.

1033
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:28,818
- Well, that's the way it is.
- You said you were going.

1034
01:22:28,819 --> 01:22:30,871
Get out.

1035
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:50,131
You dirty little phony.
Go on, lie some more.

1036
01:22:50,132 --> 01:22:52,842
Tell me how you handled things
for me in San Francisco.

1037
01:22:52,843 --> 01:22:55,052
Tell me it was all Joe's
idea. Go on, Kathie.

1038
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:57,847
Show me how you're gonna
squirm your way out this time.

1039
01:22:57,848 --> 01:23:00,850
- Listen...
- What a sucker you must think I am.

1040
01:23:00,851 --> 01:23:04,520
I took you back when you came
whimpering and crawling.

1041
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:07,440
I should have kicked your teeth in.

1042
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:10,693
No, I'm not going to.

1043
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:14,947
Not now, Kathie. We'll let
the law push you around.

1044
01:23:14,948 --> 01:23:16,866
- You can't.
- You're wrong.

1045
01:23:16,867 --> 01:23:19,076
You're gonna take the
rap and play along.

1046
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:21,996
You're gonna make every
exact move I tell you.

1047
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:24,499
If you don't, I'll kill you.

1048
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,335
And I'll promise you one
It won't be quick.

1049
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:29,420
I'll break you first.

1050
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:33,466
You won't be able to answer a phone or
open a door without thinking, "This is it."

1051
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:37,303
And when it comes,
it still won't be quick.

1052
01:23:37,304 --> 01:23:39,527
And it won't be pretty.

1053
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:43,527
You can take your choice.

1054
01:23:43,936 --> 01:23:45,863
Whit.

1055
01:24:04,831 --> 01:24:08,334
I have to go to Reno for
your money. Where's the file?

1056
01:24:08,335 --> 01:24:10,933
It'll be mailed to you.

1057
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:14,353
I crossed you once. I know better
than to try it a second time.

1058
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:18,010
I've got a reason for
wanting to be let alone.

1059
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:20,814
You'll get the file,
after I'm out of reach.

1060
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:24,934
Well, if that's the
way it has to be.

1061
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:28,187
While you're in Reno, find a pilot
who can keep his mouth shut.

1062
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:31,691
Tell him to set his plane down in
the desert where he won't be seen.

1063
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:33,734
Make it about dawn.

1064
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:36,696
And cheer up, Kathie.
You'll get out of it all right.

1065
01:24:36,697 --> 01:24:39,170
You always have.

1066
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:30,458
- They say you killed a man.
- Do you believe them?

1067
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:34,503
- Not until you tell me.
- You believe everything I say, don't you?

1068
01:25:34,504 --> 01:25:37,506
Everything you say
to me, I believe.

1069
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:40,310
I don't know why I do this.

1070
01:25:40,636 --> 01:25:43,804
I don't know why I let you come
back into my life. Why I don't...

1071
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:47,183
slap your face and send
you home. I don't know.

1072
01:25:47,184 --> 01:25:50,436
- Because you said you'd come back.
- But not like this.

1073
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:53,707
- You didn't kill him, did you?
- No.

1074
01:25:54,316 --> 01:25:56,914
You know, I had to come back.

1075
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:05,010
- Take me with you, Jeff.
- I have to play this alone.

1076
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:09,622
- You've seen her again?
- Yeah, I saw her.

1077
01:26:09,623 --> 01:26:13,268
- Was it the same?
- I saw her, and it was nothing.

1078
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:17,171
She can't be all bad. No one is.

1079
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,840
Well, she comes the closest.

1080
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:22,843
- Are you going to see her again?
- Tonight, for the last time.

1081
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:25,930
Then look at her.
And look at yourself.

1082
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:31,237
And be very sure that there isn't
even a little bit of love left for her.

1083
01:26:31,978 --> 01:26:36,691
Then when you find out and you
know it once and forever...

1084
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:38,693
send for me.

1085
01:26:38,694 --> 01:26:42,498
I don't have to find out.
I know it now.

1086
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:48,119
- That's all I wanted to hear.
- You know, maybe I was wrong...

1087
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:51,580
and luck is like love. You have
to go all the way to find it.

1088
01:26:51,581 --> 01:26:53,666
You do to keep it.

1089
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:56,627
You better go. Did the
kid do what I told him?

1090
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:59,672
They're following him south,
the state police and all of them.

1091
01:26:59,673 --> 01:27:01,225
Good.

1092
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:04,770
I can't go.

1093
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:27,626
- You can put that away.
- I can't think of a better place to put it.

1094
01:27:29,161 --> 01:27:32,538
- I just want to tell you something.
- Tell it.

1095
01:27:32,539 --> 01:27:34,307
I was going to kill you.

1096
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:37,219
- Who isn't?
- Or tell the cops where you were.

1097
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:41,181
I followed Ann tonight.

1098
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:45,968
- What stopped you?
- Some things you said to her.

1099
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:49,764
- You said were gonna tell me something.
- I grew up with her.

1100
01:27:49,765 --> 01:27:52,558
I've loved her ever since
I fixed her roller skates.

1101
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:55,853
I don't know whether I'm good enough
for her, but I know you aren't.

1102
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:59,106
That's one difference. The
other is that she loves me.

1103
01:27:59,107 --> 01:28:02,693
You told her you didn't know why you
let her back into your dirty life.

1104
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:06,197
I don't know what got you where you
are or where it's gonna take you.

1105
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:08,671
She's not going with it.

1106
01:28:09,993 --> 01:28:11,869
Why don't you say it to the law.

1107
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:15,390
Then all the rest of your life
you can tell her how you did it.

1108
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:05,394
You can't make deals
with a dead man, Jeff.

1109
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:08,105
No, you can't.

1110
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:17,309
- Let's get out of here.
- There's someplace left to go?

1111
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:20,955
- I think so.
- You're running the show now?

1112
01:29:24,484 --> 01:29:26,752
Do you mind, Jeff?

1113
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:33,534
Remember the mountains? Higher than
these and always snow on them.

1114
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:37,663
- We should have stayed there.
- I'm trying to remember something else.

1115
01:29:37,664 --> 01:29:40,207
I never told you I was
anything but what I am.

1116
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:42,501
You just wanted to imagine I was.

1117
01:29:42,502 --> 01:29:46,005
That's why I left you.
Now we're back to stay.

1118
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:49,884
- And I have nothing to say about it?
- Well, have you?

1119
01:29:49,885 --> 01:29:53,721
Whit's dead. A bundle of
papers isn't any good.

1120
01:29:53,722 --> 01:29:57,182
If Joe was around, you could
use him, but Joe's dead too.

1121
01:29:57,183 --> 01:29:59,643
So, what are you gonna do
about Eels and Fisher?

1122
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:02,187
For that matter, what are
you gonna do about this?

1123
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:04,398
Someone has to take the blame.

1124
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:08,954
You have nothing on me, but I'd make
a fine witness for the prosecution.

1125
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:13,834
Don't you see? You've only
me to make deals with now.

1126
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:17,383
- Well, build my gallows high, baby.
- No.

1127
01:30:17,871 --> 01:30:21,916
No, we're starting all over.
I wanna go back to Mexico.

1128
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:25,002
I wanna walk out of the sun
again and find you waiting.

1129
01:30:25,003 --> 01:30:29,173
I wanna sit in the same moonlight and tell
you all the things I never told you...

1130
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:33,093
until you don't hate me.
Until sometime you love again.

1131
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:36,221
They'll always be looking for us.
They won't stop till we die.

1132
01:30:36,222 --> 01:30:39,822
I don't care. Just so
they find us together.

1133
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:44,980
If you're thinking of anyone
else, don't. It wouldn't work.

1134
01:30:44,981 --> 01:30:47,483
You're no good for anyone but me.

1135
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:49,661
You're no good and neither am I.

1136
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:52,880
That's why we deserve each other.

1137
01:30:58,411 --> 01:31:00,454
Did he get the plane?

1138
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:03,916
- Where is it?
- I'm running the show, don't forget.

1139
01:31:03,917 --> 01:31:06,210
I doubt you'll ever let me.
Where's the money?

1140
01:31:06,211 --> 01:31:10,436
- Upstairs.
- Better pack a couple of bags and get it.

1141
01:31:12,425 --> 01:31:16,195
- Put a few things in for me.
- I have.

1142
01:32:05,979 --> 01:32:07,187
Thanks.

1143
01:32:09,691 --> 01:32:12,460
Do you remember La Mar Azul?

1144
01:32:12,902 --> 01:32:16,071
If I remember, you were a very
clumsy flirt, but I liked that.

1145
01:32:16,072 --> 01:32:18,466
We owe it all to José Rodriguez.

1146
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:23,259
I wonder if he'll ever know
what a bad guide he really was.

1147
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:27,750
Jeff, we've been wrong a
lot and unlucky a long time.

1148
01:32:27,751 --> 01:32:30,600
I think we deserve a break.

1149
01:32:32,005 --> 01:32:33,881
We deserve each other.

1150
01:33:06,206 --> 01:33:08,349
Hurry, Jeff.

1151
01:33:53,795 --> 01:33:55,847
Dirty, double-crossing rat!

1152
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:44,904
Sorry.

1153
01:34:48,516 --> 01:34:52,227
Too many people. Too much talk.

1154
01:34:52,228 --> 01:34:54,563
Maybe that's why I like this town.

1155
01:34:54,564 --> 01:34:57,913
Here, three people
are really a crowd.

1156
01:34:59,444 --> 01:35:02,571
Let's get in the car and
get away from them.

1157
01:35:02,572 --> 01:35:05,616
I won't talk to you, Ann.
I just wanna be with you.

1158
01:35:05,617 --> 01:35:09,046
Thanks, Jim, but I can't.

1159
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:22,935
You can tell me. You knew
him better than I did.

1160
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:26,028
Was he going away with her?

1161
01:35:27,096 --> 01:35:29,524
I have to know.

1162
01:35:31,226 --> 01:35:33,278
Was he going away with her?
