We found a new solar system. ;

the Alliance was
a beacon of civilization.

The savage outer planets
were not so enlightened...

00:09:09,456 --> 00:09:11,875
Young miss,
I need you to go to work now.

163
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:15,796
I think I may have
a long way to travel.

164
00:09:25,222 --> 00:09:29,768
Where are you hiding,
little girl?

165
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,450
[Explosion]

166
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:27,576
[Alarm buzzing]

167
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:30,412
What was that?
Did you see that?

168
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:35,083
Was that the primary
buffer panel?

169
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,419
It did seem to resemble...
Did the primary
buffer panel...

170
00:10:37,502 --> 00:10:40,464
just fall off my gorramn ship
for no apparent reason?

171
00:10:42,382 --> 00:10:43,425
Looks like.

172
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:45,052
I thought Kaylee checked
the entry couplings.

173
00:10:45,135 --> 00:10:47,137
I've a clear memory of it.
If she doesn't get us...

174
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,765
extra flow
from the engine room
to offset the burn-through...

175
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:51,475
this landing is gonna
get pretty interesting.

176
00:10:51,516 --> 00:10:54,478
Define "interesting."
"Oh, God,
we're all gonna die?"

177
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:59,149
This is the captain.
We have a little problem...

178
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:01,318
with our entry sequence,
so we may experience some...

179
00:11:01,401 --> 00:11:03,779
slight turbulence
and then explode.

180
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:05,364
Can you shave the vector?
I'm doing it!

181
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:08,116
It's not enough.
Just get us on the ground!

182
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,577
That part will happen
pretty definitely.

183
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:13,872
We're gonna explode?
I don't wanna explode.

184
00:11:13,956 --> 00:11:15,541
Jayne, how many weapons
you plan on taking?

185
00:11:15,624 --> 00:11:17,543
You only got two arms.
I just get excitable...

186
00:11:17,584 --> 00:11:19,503
as to choice.
Like to have my options open.

187
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,880
I don't plan on any shooting
taking place during this job.

188
00:11:21,964 --> 00:11:25,551
What you plan
and what takes place ain't
ever exactly been similar.

189
00:11:25,634 --> 00:11:28,011
No grenades.

190
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,347

Good to go, sir.

192

193
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:33,850
Those grenades?

194
00:11:33,892 --> 00:11:35,310
(Jayne)
Yeah, Captain
doesn't want them.

195
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,896
Jayne, we're robbing
the place. We're not
occupying it.

196

[Crashing]

197
00:11:42,526 --> 00:11:43,819
Kaylee!

198
00:11:47,155 --> 00:11:50,284
Kaylee, what in the sphincter
of hell are you playing at?

199
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:52,327
We got the primary
buffer panel coming right...

200
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,663
Everything's shiny, Captain.
Not to fret.

201
00:11:55,455 --> 00:11:58,208
You told me
those entry couplings
would hold for another week!

202
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:02,254
That was six months ago,
Captain.
My ship don't crash.

203
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,756
If she crashes,
you crashed her.

204
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:08,552
Doctor.

205
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:12,389
Guess who needs
to get innocked
before we hit planet-side.

206
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:14,641
Bit of a rockety ride.

207
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:17,185
Nothing to be worried about.
I'm not worried.

208
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,521
Fear is nothing to
be ashamed of, Doctor.

209
00:12:19,563 --> 00:12:22,190
This isn't fear.
This is anger.

210
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:27,404
Well, kind of hard to tell
one from the other,
face like yours.

211
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:30,782
Well, I imagine
if it were fear,
my eyes would be wider.

212
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:32,618
I'll keep a lookout
for that next time.

213
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:33,994
You're not taking her.

214
00:12:34,077 --> 00:12:36,914
No, no, this is not
a thing I'm interested
in talking over with...

215
00:12:36,997 --> 00:12:39,291
She's not going with you,
and that's final.

216
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:42,336
I hear the words
"that's final" come
out your mouth ever again...

217
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:43,879
they truly will be.

218
00:12:44,838 --> 00:12:48,008
This boat is my home.
You all are guests on it.

219
00:12:48,425 --> 00:12:49,635
Guests?

220
00:12:49,927 --> 00:12:52,262
Now, I earned my passage,
Captain...
(Mal)

221
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,097
your little sister learned
from your example.

222
00:12:54,181 --> 00:12:56,391
I have earned my passage...

00:12:56,975 --> 00:13:00,312
treating bullet holes,
knife wounds, laser burns.

224
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:02,147
Some jobs are more
interesting than others.

225
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:04,191
And you want to put my sister
in the middle of that.

226
00:13:04,274 --> 00:13:06,401
Didn't say "want."
Said "will."

227
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,153
It's one job, Doc.
She'll be fine.

228
00:13:08,237 --> 00:13:10,781
She's a 17-year-old girl.

229
00:13:11,114 --> 00:13:13,742

traumatized 17...
She's a reader.

Sees into the truth
of things.

231
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:18,956
Might see trouble
before it's coming.
Which is of use to me.

232
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,417
And that's your guiding star,
isn't it? What's of use.

233
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:26,463
Honestly, Doctor,
I think we may really
crash this time anyway.

234
00:13:27,297 --> 00:13:28,882
Do you understand
what I have gone through...

235
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:30,384
to keep River away
from the Alliance?

236
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:33,011
I do, and it's a fact
we here have been courteous...

237
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:34,638
enough to keep
to our own selves.

Are you threatening to...
I look out for me and mine.

That don't include you
less I conjure it does.

240
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:45,023
You stuck a thorn
in the Alliance's paw.
That tickles me a bit.

241
00:13:45,107 --> 00:13:47,901
But it also means
I got to step
twice as fast to avoid them...

242
00:13:47,985 --> 00:13:50,445
and that means
turning down plenty of jobs.

there well may not be another.

Someone is talking to her.

632

Subliminal.

633
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:36,987
It's a subliminal message,
broadwaved to trigger her.

634
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:40,449
I've been seeing this code
pop up all over,
the last few weeks.

635
00:41:40,866 --> 00:41:43,410
It's Alliance
and it's high military.

636
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:48,874
They have gone
to enormous trouble
to find your little friend.

637
00:41:49,833 --> 00:41:51,793
And found her, they have.

638

Do you all know
what it is you're carrying?

639
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:05,140
They're afraid of me.

640
00:42:06,517 --> 00:42:09,603
I'm sorry.
They should be.

641
00:42:10,854 --> 00:42:14,316
But I'll show them. Oh, God.

642

It's okay. Hey, it's okay.

I don't know what I'm saying.
I never know what I'm saying.

647
00:42:36,046 --> 00:42:38,298
In the Maidenhead,
you said something.

648
00:42:39,341 --> 00:42:41,635
When you were triggered,
do you remember?

649
00:42:41,718 --> 00:42:44,346
The Captain saw you
say something on the feed.

00:42:51,895 --> 00:42:53,522
Ask her.

653
00:42:55,607 --> 00:42:57,359
Who is Miranda?

654
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:04,908
Am I talking to Miranda now?

655
00:43:07,828 --> 00:43:08,829
No.

656
00:43:10,747 --> 00:43:11,790
Not right.

657
00:43:14,668 --> 00:43:18,630
But I think
when they triggered you...

658
00:43:19,464 --> 00:43:21,425
it somehow brought this up.

659
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:24,052
This memory.
It isn't mine.

660

The memory, it isn't mine.

And I shouldn't have
to carry it. It isn't mine.

Put a bullet to me.

Bullet in the brainpan,

Don't say that. Not ever.

You got a plan?

they want her hid.

That means closed file.

you've not known.

in the 'verse...

something of a problem
here with the locals.

And, I thought maybe...
You could use a gun hand?

734
00:48:17,262 --> 00:48:21,391
I'm hoping not.
But if you happen
to be close at all, you...

your ease here for a while.

to drop it off.

I didn't mean to leave stuff.
I didn't look
through the stuff.

where it's a trap?

then Inara's already
caught in it.

happens to me...

within the hour...

please bring me a pony,
and a plastic rocket, and...

doing here?

774
00:50:49,831 --> 00:50:50,999
Well, you invited me.

775
00:50:51,083 --> 00:50:53,669
I never thought for a second
you'd be stupid enough
to come.

776
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:55,587
Well, that makes you
kind of a tease, doesn't it?

777
00:50:55,671 --> 00:50:57,589
You knew my invitation
wasn't on the level.

778
00:50:57,673 --> 00:51:00,634
Which led me to conclude
that you must be
in some trouble.

779
00:51:00,717 --> 00:51:02,469
I'm fine. I'm giddy.

780
00:51:02,553 --> 00:51:04,972
For a woman schooled
in telling a man
what he wants to hear...

781
00:51:05,055 --> 00:51:08,517
you ain't much of a liar.
Mal, you cannot
handle this man.

782
00:51:14,606 --> 00:51:15,774
I have to say, Captain...

783
00:51:15,858 --> 00:51:18,694
I'm impressed that you
would come for her yourself.

784
00:51:19,027 --> 00:51:22,155
And that you would make it
this far, in that outfit.

785
00:51:23,323 --> 00:51:25,617
I can be very graceful
when I need to.

786
00:51:25,701 --> 00:51:27,035
I've no doubt.

787
00:51:28,453 --> 00:51:31,164
What are you doing?
I'm praying for you, Mal.

788
00:51:31,874 --> 00:51:33,667
She's very thoughtful.

789
00:51:34,084 --> 00:51:37,045
But I mean it when I say
I've no intent to harm you.

790
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:39,464
Speak your piece.

791
00:51:39,923 --> 00:51:41,800
I think you're
beginning to understand...

792
00:51:41,884 --> 00:51:43,844
how dangerous River Tam is.

793
00:51:44,219 --> 00:51:46,013
She is a mite unpredictable.

It usually is.

796
00:51:50,851 --> 00:51:54,479
That girl will
rain destruction down
on you and your ship.

797
00:51:55,898 --> 00:51:58,650
She is an albatross, Captain.

798
00:51:58,817 --> 00:52:00,527
Way I remember it...

799
00:52:00,652 --> 00:52:03,989
albatross was
a ship's good luck,
till some idiot killed it.

Yes, I've read a poem.

I know how you must feel about
the Alliance.

803
00:52:13,415 --> 00:52:15,584
You really don't.
Fair to say.

804
00:52:16,335 --> 00:52:19,171
But I have to hope
you understand,
you can't beat us.

805
00:52:19,254 --> 00:52:20,964
I got no need to beat you.

806
00:52:21,048 --> 00:52:23,926
I just want to go my way.
And you can do that...

807
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,763
once you let me take
River Tam back home.

808
00:52:31,475 --> 00:52:34,019
No, no. You're working
this deal all crabbed.

809
00:52:34,102 --> 00:52:36,813
You got to open with payment.
That is a trap.

810

you'll play the man of honor
and take umbrage.

I have no stomach for games.

813
00:52:46,448 --> 00:52:48,450
I already know
you will not see reason.

814
00:52:48,534 --> 00:52:50,077
The Alliance wanted to
show me a reason...

815
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,371
they shouldn't have sent
an assassin.

816
00:52:58,585 --> 00:53:01,713
I have a warship
in deep orbit, Captain.

817
00:53:02,381 --> 00:53:05,884
We locked on
to Serenity's pulse beacon
the moment you hit atmo.

818
00:53:06,051 --> 00:53:08,053
I can speak a word
and send a missile...

819
00:53:08,136 --> 00:53:10,848
to that exact location
inside of three minutes.

820

01:43:33,412 --> 01:43:36,206
You should know
there's no shame in this.

1406
01:43:38,417 --> 01:43:40,544
You've done remarkable things.

1407
01:43:41,753 --> 01:43:43,964
But you're fighting a war...

1408
01:43:45,174 --> 01:43:46,383
you've already lost.

1409
01:43:47,467 --> 01:43:48,635
[Groans]

1410
01:43:49,887 --> 01:43:50,846
[Gasping]

1411
01:43:51,221 --> 01:43:53,098
Well, I'm known for that.

1412
01:43:55,017 --> 01:43:56,018
[Groaning]

1413
01:44:02,024 --> 01:44:05,652
Piece of shrapnel tore up
that nerve cluster
my first tour.

1414
01:44:06,236 --> 01:44:07,571
Had it moved.

1415
01:44:09,156 --> 01:44:10,574
Sorry about the throat.

1416
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:14,036
Expect you'd want to say your
famous last words right now.

1417
01:44:15,078 --> 01:44:16,663
Just one trouble.

1418
01:44:21,418 --> 01:44:22,878
I ain't gonna kill you.

1419
01:44:23,545 --> 01:44:24,838
[Gasping]

1420
01:44:26,381 --> 01:44:29,468
Hell, I'm gonna grant
your greatest wish.

1421
01:44:31,178 --> 01:44:32,179
[Beeping]

1422
01:44:36,808 --> 01:44:39,645
I'm gonna show you
a world without sin.

1423
01:44:45,484 --> 01:44:47,569
These are just a few of
the few images we've recorded.

1424
01:44:47,611 --> 01:44:48,612
And you can see...

1425
01:44:51,532 --> 01:44:53,700
it isn't what we thought.

1426
01:44:55,410 --> 01:44:57,287
There's been no war here...

1427
01:44:57,955 --> 01:45:02,251
and no terraforming event.
The environment is stable.

1428
01:45:03,919 --> 01:45:05,671
It's the Pax.

1429
01:45:07,339 --> 01:45:11,677
The G-23 Paxilon Hydroclorate
that we added
to the air processors.

1430
01:45:12,386 --> 01:45:14,972
It was supposed to calm
the population...

1431
01:45:15,097 --> 01:45:16,515
[roaring]

1432
01:45:43,584 --> 01:45:45,252
We meant it for the best...

1433
01:45:46,170 --> 01:45:47,713
to make people safer.

1434
01:45:47,796 --> 01:45:49,423
[Reavers growling]

1435
01:45:49,464 --> 01:45:50,799
God!

1436
01:45:52,801 --> 01:45:54,219
[Woman screaming]

1437
01:45:54,303 --> 01:45:55,929
[Reaver growling]

1438
01:46:07,357 --> 01:46:08,358
[Panting]

1439
01:46:13,655 --> 01:46:16,116
Sir?
It's done.

1440
01:46:19,286 --> 01:46:20,621
Report.

1441
01:46:22,789 --> 01:46:23,957
River?

1442
01:46:49,525 --> 01:46:50,484
(soldier #1)
Drop your weapons!

1443
01:46:50,567 --> 01:46:51,610
(soldier #2)
Do it now.

1444
01:46:51,693 --> 01:46:53,153
Weapons down.
Let it down, now.

1445
01:46:53,195 --> 01:46:54,821
I want to see
your hands in the air.

1446
01:46:54,863 --> 01:46:56,740
Stand down.
Do it.

1447
01:47:02,204 --> 01:47:03,705
Targets are acquired.

1448
01:47:03,747 --> 01:47:05,165
Do we have a kill order?

1449
01:47:08,126 --> 01:47:09,878
Do we have an order?

1450
01:47:18,053 --> 01:47:19,304
(Operative)
Stand down.

1451
01:47:20,430 --> 01:47:23,183
Stand down. It's finished.

1452
01:47:26,979 --> 01:47:28,355
We're finished.

1453
01:49:30,727 --> 01:49:32,604
It's not over,
you know.

1454
01:49:34,314 --> 01:49:36,984
I can't guarantee
that they won't
come after you.

1455
01:49:37,818 --> 01:49:38,819
The Parliament.

1456
01:49:39,695 --> 01:49:42,698
Your broadwave about Miranda
has weakened their regime.

1457
01:49:42,781 --> 01:49:47,119
They are not gone
and they are not... forgiving.

1458
01:49:47,703 --> 01:49:50,164
That don't bode
especially well for you...

1459
01:49:50,914 --> 01:49:53,917
giving the order to let us go,
patching up our hurt.

1460
01:49:55,294 --> 01:49:58,755
I told them the Tams
were no longer a threat,
damage done.

1461
01:49:59,298 --> 01:50:00,799
They might listen...

1462
01:50:01,550 --> 01:50:04,970
but I think they know
I'm no longer their man.

1463
01:50:06,722 --> 01:50:09,808
They take you down,
I don't expect
to grieve over much.

1464
01:50:12,060 --> 01:50:14,479
Like to kill you myself,
I see you again.

1465
01:50:15,314 --> 01:50:16,315
You won't.

1466
01:50:19,276 --> 01:50:21,445
There is nothing left to see.

1467
01:50:27,159 --> 01:50:28,702
Sir, we have
a green light.

1468
01:50:29,119 --> 01:50:31,330
Inspection's pos
and we're clear
for up-thrust.

1469
01:50:37,836 --> 01:50:39,963
Think she'll hold together?

1470
01:50:40,964 --> 01:50:43,592
She's tore up plenty.
But she'll fly true.

1471
01:50:47,888 --> 01:50:50,140
Make sure
everything's secure.

1472
01:50:52,017 --> 01:50:54,895
Could be bumpy.
Always is.

1473
01:51:02,319 --> 01:51:03,320
Taking her out...

1474
01:51:03,403 --> 01:51:05,989
should be about a day's ride
to get you back to your girls.

1475
01:51:06,031 --> 01:51:07,199
Right.

1476
01:51:08,617 --> 01:51:10,828
Ready to get off this heap,
back to civilized life?

1477
01:51:10,911 --> 01:51:11,912
I, uh...

1478
01:51:16,708 --> 01:51:18,043
I don't know.

1479
01:51:20,045 --> 01:51:21,213
Good answer.

1480
01:51:46,446 --> 01:51:48,991
So, you gonna ride
shotgun with me,
help me fly?

1481
01:51:49,199 --> 01:51:50,450
That's the plan.

1482
01:51:51,118 --> 01:51:52,661
Think you can work out...

1483
01:51:52,744 --> 01:51:54,496
[engine revving]

1484
01:52:00,335 --> 01:52:01,336
Okay.

1485
01:52:02,713 --> 01:52:05,841
Clearly some
aptitude for the...

1486
01:52:07,342 --> 01:52:09,845
It ain't all buttons
and charts, little albatross.

1487
01:52:10,304 --> 01:52:12,431
You know what the first rule
of flying is?

1488
01:52:12,931 --> 01:52:15,934
Well, I suppose you do,
since you already know
what I'm about to say.

1489
01:52:16,977 --> 01:52:18,437
(River)
I do.

1490
01:52:19,605 --> 01:52:21,356
But I like to hear you say it.

1491
01:52:26,153 --> 01:52:27,154
Love.

1492
01:52:27,488 --> 01:52:29,406
You can learn all the math
in the 'verse...

1493
01:52:29,448 --> 01:52:31,492
but you take a boat in
the air that you don't love...

1494
01:52:31,575 --> 01:52:34,411
she'll shake you off
just as sure as
the turn of the worlds.

1495
01:52:37,748 --> 01:52:40,459
Love keeps her in the air
when she ought to fall down...

1496
01:52:41,919 --> 01:52:44,254
tells you she's hurting
before she keels.

1497
01:52:47,090 --> 01:52:48,300
Makes her a home.

1498
01:52:49,635 --> 01:52:51,220
[Rain pattering]

1499
01:52:53,889 --> 01:52:55,724
Storm's getting worse.

1500
01:52:58,060 --> 01:53:00,729
We'll pass through it
soon enough.

1501
01:53:21,834 --> 01:53:22,751
(Mal)
What was that?
