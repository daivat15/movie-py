1
00:01:01,459 --> 00:01:04,761
<i>I have no idea
how to tell this story.</i>

2
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,531
<i>I don't even know
how to start it.</i>

3
00:01:08,533 --> 00:01:10,766
<i>Like, I guess I could use
one of those classic</i>

4
00:01:10,768 --> 00:01:13,535
<i>story beginning sentences.</i>

5
00:01:13,537 --> 00:01:16,604
<i>"It was the best of times;
it was the worst of times."</i>

6
00:01:16,606 --> 00:01:19,306
<i>But what would that even mean?</i>

7
00:01:19,308 --> 00:01:21,174
<i>I mean, obviously,
somewhere in the world,</i>

8
00:01:21,176 --> 00:01:23,476
<i>it's the best of times
for someone.</i>

9
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:25,377
<i>Like he's eating all this insane</i>

10
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:26,911
<i>Vietnamese food
he just got for free...</i>

11
00:01:26,913 --> 00:01:28,913
<i>...and the woman
who delivered the food</i>

12
00:01:28,915 --> 00:01:31,282
<i>looks exactly like the hot
girl from Pussy Riot</i>

13
00:01:31,284 --> 00:01:33,450
<i>and now she's situated
in the corner</i>

14
00:01:33,452 --> 00:01:35,752
<i>playing unspeakably beautiful
melodies on the harp.</i>

15
00:01:35,754 --> 00:01:37,653
<i>While he's just going to town
on that food.</i>

16
00:01:37,655 --> 00:01:40,455
<i>So, yeah,
that's the best of times.</i>

17
00:01:40,457 --> 00:01:42,623
<i>Meanwhile, some other guy
is having</i>

18
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,458
<i>his will broken
by professional torturers...</i>

19
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,794
<i>over a crocodile-infested
pool of acid.</i>

20
00:01:47,796 --> 00:01:49,462
<i>And because it's acid,</i>

21
00:01:49,464 --> 00:01:51,530
<i>these crocodiles
are just pissed.</i>

22
00:01:51,532 --> 00:01:53,698
<i>And they're also piping in
that gross smell you get...</i>

23
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,332
<i>...when they spill
a bunch of milk</i>

24
00:01:55,334 --> 00:01:56,499
<i>in the school parking lot.</i>

25
00:01:56,501 --> 00:01:58,367
<i>And this beefy torture dude</i>

26
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:00,302
<i>is just punching
the hell out of him.</i>

27
00:02:00,304 --> 00:02:02,403
<i>Check.</i>

28
00:02:09,843 --> 00:02:13,412
<i>All right, look.
I'll just start.</i>

29
00:02:13,414 --> 00:02:15,447
<i>This is the story of
my senior year of high school</i>

30
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:17,348
<i>and how it destroyed my life.</i>

31
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:20,384
<i>And how I made a film so bad,
it literally killed someone.</i>

32
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:49,777
<i>I used to think about it
this way:</i>

33
00:02:49,779 --> 00:02:52,880
<i>Schenley High School
was a world unto itself.</i>

34
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:55,782
<i>By senior year, I had mastered
the languages and customs</i>

35
00:02:55,784 --> 00:02:57,064
<i>of its various sovereign states.</i>

36
00:02:57,684 --> 00:03:00,419
<i>The head nods of Jock Nation.</i>

37
00:03:00,421 --> 00:03:02,821
<i>The fist bumps
of the Kingdom of Stoners.</i>

38
00:03:02,823 --> 00:03:04,656
<i>The innocuous witticisms of</i>

39
00:03:04,658 --> 00:03:05,857
<i>The People's Republic
of Theater Dorks.</i>

40
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:08,259
Greg, how was your summer?

41
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:10,327
Summer. What does that word
even mean?

42
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:12,295
Like, more "summ"?

43
00:03:12,297 --> 00:03:13,462
<i>In a typical high school life,</i>

44
00:03:13,464 --> 00:03:15,597
<i>you belong to one nation...</i>

45
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,966
<i>...which can never
guarantee you total security.</i>

46
00:03:19,401 --> 00:03:21,281
<i>But I thought
I found a way out.</i>

47
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,871
<i>Get citizenship in every nation.</i>

48
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:28,273
<i>Get passports to everywhere.</i>

49
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,575
<i>Just be on low-key
good terms with everyone...</i>

50
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,777
<i>...casually interact with them
once in a while...</i>

51
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,945
<i>...in a way that is invisible
to everyone else.</i>

52
00:03:35,746 --> 00:03:37,613
<i>Never commit to an interaction</i>

53
00:03:37,615 --> 00:03:39,381
<i>that won't be casual or mellow.</i>

54
00:03:39,982 --> 00:03:41,849
Your test was today?

55
00:03:41,851 --> 00:03:43,951
Ugh. Tests!
I've been there.

56
00:03:43,953 --> 00:03:46,720
<i>That's like sending troops
to Afghanistan.</i>

57
00:03:46,722 --> 00:03:48,722
<i>Maintain relationships
with citizens</i>

58
00:03:48,724 --> 00:03:50,323
<i>of the most
dicked-upon nations.</i>

59
00:03:50,325 --> 00:03:52,792
<i>For example, Scott Mayhew,</i>

60
00:03:52,794 --> 00:03:54,827
<i>the gothy dork
I'm sitting next to here.</i>

61
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:55,961
Scott, nice Berserker.

62
00:03:55,963 --> 00:03:57,796
Thank you?

63
00:03:57,798 --> 00:04:00,298
<i>It took years of cultivation
to win his trust.</i>

64
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:05,902
<i>Or the universally
ostracized Ill Phil.</i>

65
00:04:09,407 --> 00:04:10,939
<i>Truly a nation of one.</i>

66
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:16,510
<i>And there were some
places I simply couldn't go.</i>

67
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,979
<i>Like the cafeteria.</i>

68
00:04:18,981 --> 00:04:21,781
<i>Every last square inch of it
was disputed territory.</i>

69
00:04:22,616 --> 00:04:24,550
<i>It was Crimea, Kashmir,</i>

70
00:04:24,552 --> 00:04:26,632
<i>and the Gaza Strip
all rolled into one.</i>

71
00:04:27,653 --> 00:04:31,055
<i>Also the part of
the Indian Ocean with pirates.</i>

72
00:04:31,057 --> 00:04:34,958
Captain Phillips <i>pirates,</i>
<i>not</i> Pirates of the Caribbean.

73
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,593
<i>Although, actually, who knows?
Maybe both.</i>

74
00:04:44,365 --> 00:04:45,732
<i>Instead, I always ate lunch
in the office</i>

75
00:04:45,734 --> 00:04:47,033
<i>of my history teacher.</i>

76
00:04:47,035 --> 00:04:48,067
<i>Mr. McCarthy.</i>

77
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:49,968
Fact:

78
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,037
I'm in 309 for
the next... 20 minutes.

79
00:04:54,572 --> 00:04:56,940
<i>The only reasonable adult
in all of Schenley.</i>

80
00:04:56,942 --> 00:04:58,474
Heathens.

81
00:04:58,476 --> 00:05:00,409
Respect the research.

82
00:05:00,411 --> 00:05:02,611
<i>With Earl,
whose role in my life</i>

83
00:05:02,613 --> 00:05:05,380
<i>I'm not even gonna try to
explain to you right now.</i>

84
00:05:05,382 --> 00:05:09,884
<i>The harmony of overwhelming
and collective murder.</i>

85
00:05:09,886 --> 00:05:11,986
<i>Hot girls destroy your life.</i>

86
00:05:11,988 --> 00:05:16,123
<i>It doesn't matter if the hot
girl is also a good person.</i>

87
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,992
<i>She's a moose,
you're a chipmunk.</i>

88
00:05:18,994 --> 00:05:21,234
<i>She's just wandering through
the forest, oblivious.</i>

89
00:05:22,596 --> 00:05:24,877
<i>And she doesn't even know that
she stomped on your head.</i>

90
00:05:26,998 --> 00:05:28,631
Hey, Madison.

91
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:30,733
Hey, how was your summer?

92
00:05:30,735 --> 00:05:33,368
Summer. What does that word
even mean, right?

93
00:05:33,802 --> 00:05:36,003
More "summ."

94
00:05:36,005 --> 00:05:38,672
Winter, same deal.
More "wint"?

95
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,507
McCarthy's in 309.

96
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:43,809
Great, thanks.

97
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,744
<i>To become humbled</i>

98
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:47,712
<i>in front of
this overwhelming misery...</i>

99
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,781
<i>...and overwhelming
fornication</i>

100
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,516
<i>and overwhelming lack of order.</i>

101
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,750
Titties.

102
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,053
Honey, can we come in?
Jesus, Jesus!

103
00:05:58,055 --> 00:06:00,455
Yeah. What do you want?

104
00:06:00,457 --> 00:06:02,056
First of all,
I was going through...

105
00:06:02,058 --> 00:06:04,525
...your stuff
and I saw that you

106
00:06:04,527 --> 00:06:06,126
have not even unwrapped
your college directory.

107
00:06:06,128 --> 00:06:07,827
Mom, don't go through my stuff.

108
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:10,863
We discussed it, and she gets
to go through your stuff.

109
00:06:10,865 --> 00:06:12,531
Just have a look.
It's fun.

110
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:13,832
It's like a menu
for your future.

111
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:16,668
What are you in the mood for?
Some Penn State?

112
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,437
Some Pepperdine?
Pomona? Princeton?

113
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,638
I'm not getting into Princeton.

114
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,280
He's not getting into Princeton.

115
00:06:22,706 --> 00:06:24,073
Um, so, is that it?

116
00:06:24,075 --> 00:06:26,041
No, honey, it's not it.

117
00:06:26,043 --> 00:06:28,963
Your father and I want to talk to you
about something kind of sad.

118
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:31,879
What?

119
00:06:36,049 --> 00:06:37,849
What happened?

120
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:39,984
Well, I just got off the phone
with Denise Kushner,

121
00:06:39,986 --> 00:06:42,152
Rachel's mom. You know Denise?

122
00:06:42,154 --> 00:06:43,987
Um, not really.

123
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:45,555
You're friends
with Rachel, though.

124
00:06:45,557 --> 00:06:46,997
Yeah, I mean,
we're like, acquainted.

125
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,523
Come here.

126
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:51,025
Okay.

127
00:06:57,464 --> 00:07:00,032
Rachel's been diagnosed
with leukemia.

128
00:07:00,034 --> 00:07:01,566
They just found out.

129
00:07:03,068 --> 00:07:04,601
Your test was today?

130
00:07:07,204 --> 00:07:08,938
Ugh. Tests! I've been there.

131
00:07:10,974 --> 00:07:12,474
Oh, God.

132
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,777
Is that serious?

133
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:18,011
They're doing
all kinds of tests.

134
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:19,178
They're doing
everything they can.

135
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,746
They just don't know.

136
00:07:20,748 --> 00:07:22,647
Man, that sucks.

137
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:23,781
You're right.

138
00:07:23,783 --> 00:07:25,916
It sucks.

139
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:27,884
It sucks really bad.

140
00:07:27,886 --> 00:07:29,685
It sucks quite a bit.

141
00:07:29,986 --> 00:07:30,986
Yeah.

142
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:38,892
Dad, Cat Stevens is clawing me.

143
00:07:38,894 --> 00:07:40,760
Well, he's deeply distraught.

144
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,795
Well, you know,
I was talking to Denise...

145
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,197
...and Denise feels that
you might be someone...

146
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,599
...who could make
Rachel feel better.

147
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,101
Yeah, but like I said,

148
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,102
we're not really friends, so...

149
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,837
Just give Rachel a call.

150
00:07:54,972 --> 00:07:56,639
Yeah, well, what do you
want me to say?

151
00:07:56,641 --> 00:07:57,940
"Hey, it's Greg, the guy who's

152
00:07:57,942 --> 00:07:59,342
"never really paid
attention to you...

153
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:01,677
"...but now you have cancer,
so let's hang out"?

154
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:02,911
That's not gonna work.

155
00:08:02,913 --> 00:08:04,078
She'll think
you're being sarcastic.

156
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,345
Are you telling me
you can't do

157
00:08:05,347 --> 00:08:07,246
one nice thing
for another person?

158
00:08:07,248 --> 00:08:09,281
I mean, honestly, is that
really what's happening here?

159
00:08:09,283 --> 00:08:11,650
Fine. Okay.

160
00:08:11,652 --> 00:08:13,918
Just, please don't
go through my stuff.

161
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,253
Or I'll start going through
your stuff.

162
00:08:16,255 --> 00:08:18,922
I hope you like tampons.

163
00:08:18,924 --> 00:08:21,858
<i>It's
Central Pittsburgh on 90.5...</i>

164
00:08:24,928 --> 00:08:26,295
<i>This is Rachel.</i>

165
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,030
Hey, it's Greg Gaines.

166
00:08:28,032 --> 00:08:29,032
<i>Hi.</i>

167
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,133
Yo!

168
00:08:32,135 --> 00:08:35,870
So, I called a doctor...

169
00:08:35,872 --> 00:08:38,239
...he said you needed
a prescription of Greg-acil.

170
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:39,481
<i>What's that?</i>

171
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:41,081
Uh...

172
00:08:41,342 --> 00:08:42,809
It's me.

173
00:08:45,012 --> 00:08:46,879
In convenient gel-tab form.

174
00:08:47,847 --> 00:08:48,847
<i>Oh.</i>

175
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:50,881
Yeah.

176
00:08:52,818 --> 00:08:54,317
<i>So, I guess
you heard I'm sick.</i>

177
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:55,785
Yeah.

178
00:08:55,787 --> 00:08:57,319
<i>Did my mom tell you?</i>

179
00:08:57,321 --> 00:08:59,921
Um, well, my mom told me.

180
00:08:59,923 --> 00:09:00,923
<i>Oh.</i>

181
00:09:01,857 --> 00:09:03,023
So, um...

182
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:04,991
<i>What?</i>

183
00:09:04,993 --> 00:09:06,025
What?

184
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:08,126
<i>What were you gonna say?</i>

185
00:09:08,827 --> 00:09:09,860
Um...

186
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:12,195
<i>Greg, what?</i>

187
00:09:12,197 --> 00:09:14,630
Uh, yeah,
I was just calling to see

188
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:16,164
if you wanted to hang out.

189
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:17,898
<i>Right now?</i>

190
00:09:18,332 --> 00:09:19,999
Um, sure.

191
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:21,967
<i>No, thanks.</i>

192
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:24,202
Oh.

193
00:09:24,204 --> 00:09:26,204
Okay, so you don't
wanna hang out?

194
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:27,905
<i>No. Thanks anyways.</i>

195
00:09:28,907 --> 00:09:31,008
Okay. Um, bye.

196
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:32,376
<i>Bye.</i>

197
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:36,178
Mom, what are you doing?

198
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,046
Okay, Mom, listen,
she doesn't want to see me.

199
00:09:38,048 --> 00:09:39,680
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you, Gregory...

200
00:09:39,682 --> 00:09:40,647
...that you do not
have a choice

201
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:42,081
in this particular matter.

202
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,348
Mom, please, let me say
one thing for one second.

203
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,882
You have been
given an opportunity

204
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,984
to make a very real difference
in someone's life.

205
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,385
And if what you're
choosing instead

206
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:49,419
is to lie around the house
all day...

207
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:52,054
She doesn't want to see me!

208
00:09:52,056 --> 00:09:53,755
...I will be required
to step in...

209
00:09:53,757 --> 00:09:55,857
We're not even friends!

210
00:09:55,859 --> 00:09:58,125
...and inform you that
that is 100% unacceptable.

211
00:09:58,127 --> 00:10:00,760
Your nonstop stream of
words is making me freak out!

212
00:10:00,762 --> 00:10:02,094
And if you think that all
these excuses you're making

213
00:10:02,096 --> 00:10:03,795
are in any way better...

214
00:10:03,797 --> 00:10:05,930
...or more important,
than the happiness

215
00:10:05,932 --> 00:10:07,298
of a girl with cancer...

216
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,932
Mom! I am now entering
a subhuman state.

217
00:10:08,934 --> 00:10:10,233
...a friend with cancer,

218
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,101
you are sadly mistaken,
my friend.

219
00:10:13,704 --> 00:10:15,904
You are going to pick up
that phone.

220
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,373
You're going to
call Rachel again.

221
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,295
You are going to.
You are going to.

222
00:10:48,869 --> 00:10:50,336
Oh, Greg.

223
00:10:52,472 --> 00:10:54,239
Oh, Mrs. Kushner.

224
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,173
Denise, Greg.

225
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:59,141
To you, I'm Denise, okay?

226
00:10:59,143 --> 00:11:01,309
Oh, okay. Good.

227
00:11:01,311 --> 00:11:03,978
You're a real good kid,
you know that?

228
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,113
You really are.
You just have a big heart.

229
00:11:07,148 --> 00:11:09,082
You're kind, nice.

230
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:13,051
I really appreciate it.

231
00:11:14,186 --> 00:11:15,426
Thank you.

232
00:11:17,822 --> 00:11:20,142
Good, good, good, good, good...

233
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,024
...good boy.

234
00:11:23,026 --> 00:11:24,759
Okay.

235
00:11:24,761 --> 00:11:27,928
You really are kind,
big-hearted, delicious...

236
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,996
...yummy, yummy, young boy.

237
00:11:31,331 --> 00:11:34,099
And you're so, so, handsome.

238
00:11:34,101 --> 00:11:36,768
Oh, I'm not handsome,
but thank you.

239
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,170
And so modest.

240
00:11:39,172 --> 00:11:40,292
I guess I'm a modest mouse.

241
00:11:42,774 --> 00:11:45,208
Greg, where do you come up
with this stuff?

242
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,843
Well, that's the name
of a band, actually.

243
00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:49,325
Oh.
Yeah.

244
00:11:49,811 --> 00:11:51,378
Rachel!

245
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,180
I've got a modest little mouse
here to see you!

246
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:56,248
Rachel.

247
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,916
Greg, what are you doing here?

248
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,084
So, uh...

249
00:12:01,286 --> 00:12:02,819
...the doctor
really recommends

250
00:12:02,821 --> 00:12:05,154
a strong dosage of Gregitor.

251
00:12:05,156 --> 00:12:06,421
You already used that joke.

252
00:12:06,423 --> 00:12:07,423
No.

253
00:12:08,824 --> 00:12:11,292
No, 'cause last time
it was about Greg-acil...

254
00:12:11,294 --> 00:12:14,194
...which if you recall comes
in convenient gel-tab form.

255
00:12:14,196 --> 00:12:16,262
Look, I don't want you
hanging out with me.

256
00:12:16,264 --> 00:12:17,896
I don't need your stupid pity.

257
00:12:17,898 --> 00:12:18,863
It's fine, you can just go.

258
00:12:18,865 --> 00:12:20,364
No, no.

259
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:22,966
You got it all wrong. I'm not
here 'cause I pity you.

260
00:12:22,968 --> 00:12:25,435
I'm actually here
because my mom is making me.

261
00:12:27,004 --> 00:12:28,504
That's actually worse.

262
00:12:28,506 --> 00:12:30,772
Yeah, I know.

263
00:12:30,774 --> 00:12:34,108
Look, it's okay. Honestly,
I'm fine. Just... just go.

264
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,443
Okay, Rachel, just listen
to me for a second.

265
00:12:37,878 --> 00:12:40,412
My mom is gonna turn my life
into a living hell...

266
00:12:40,414 --> 00:12:42,881
...if I don't hang out
with you.

267
00:12:42,883 --> 00:12:46,251
I can't overstate how annoying
she's being about this.

268
00:12:46,253 --> 00:12:48,920
She's basically like
the LeBron James of nagging.

269
00:12:51,056 --> 00:12:52,389
LeBron James plays basketball.

270
00:12:52,391 --> 00:12:53,631
I know who LeBron James is.

271
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:58,093
Look, I know I'm not doing you
any favors here.

272
00:12:58,095 --> 00:13:00,261
What I'm asking is for you
to do me a favor.

273
00:13:00,263 --> 00:13:01,061
You want a favor from me?

274
00:13:01,228 --> 00:13:02,928
Yes.

275
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,430
Just let me hang out
with you for one day.

276
00:13:05,432 --> 00:13:07,265
I could tell
my mom we hung out

277
00:13:07,267 --> 00:13:09,567
and then we'll just be
out of each other's lives.

278
00:13:10,168 --> 00:13:11,334
Deal?

279
00:13:13,437 --> 00:13:14,437
Deal.

280
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:16,938
Word.

281
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,373
Is that a Black Power salute?

282
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,141
No, I was going in
for a fist bump.

283
00:13:21,143 --> 00:13:22,275
I can't fist bump you
from up here.

284
00:13:22,277 --> 00:13:24,143
Yeah, I realize that.

285
00:13:39,893 --> 00:13:40,959
Books.

286
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,560
Nice.

287
00:13:46,397 --> 00:13:47,430
And, uh...

288
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:50,432
...tree wallpaper.

289
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,533
That's good.

290
00:13:53,101 --> 00:13:54,101
Why?

291
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:56,102
I don't know.

292
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,596
There's a lot of pillows
in here.

293
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:29,466
Mmm-hmm.

294
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,502
Seriously, like, how many...
how many pillows is that?

295
00:14:33,871 --> 00:14:34,971
I don't know.

296
00:14:36,073 --> 00:14:38,240
I wish I had
that many pillows.

297
00:14:38,242 --> 00:14:42,011
So, ask your parents for some.

298
00:14:42,013 --> 00:14:44,346
No, they'd be suspicious
or something.

299
00:14:45,715 --> 00:14:47,682
What, that you'd sleep
all the time?

300
00:14:47,684 --> 00:14:49,684
No. Probably assume

301
00:14:49,686 --> 00:14:51,318
I was gonna masturbate
all over them.

302
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,621
They just have
some gross ideas about me.

303
00:14:54,623 --> 00:14:55,623
But that's on them.

304
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,225
They're always getting
sexy pillows.

305
00:15:01,194 --> 00:15:02,527
This is a nice pillow.

306
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:03,661
This pillow is a dude,
obviously...

307
00:15:03,663 --> 00:15:05,195
...but it reminds me
of this pillow

308
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:07,096
we used to have
named Francesca.

309
00:15:07,098 --> 00:15:08,630
They have a similar coloring.

310
00:15:08,632 --> 00:15:10,498
Anyway, Francesca,
we had to eventually

311
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,733
give away because in the end...

312
00:15:12,735 --> 00:15:15,035
...that whole situation
was just a real problem.

313
00:15:15,037 --> 00:15:16,636
It was a mess.

314
00:15:16,638 --> 00:15:19,071
There was a real chemistry

315
00:15:19,073 --> 00:15:21,239
between us both that
I think no one could deny.

316
00:15:22,441 --> 00:15:24,308
I know the world may have
thought it was wrong...

317
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,144
...but I think, personally,
the world was wrong...

318
00:15:27,146 --> 00:15:29,045
...about what
could be between...

319
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,581
...a pillow, and a boy...

320
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:35,149
...who became a man.

321
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,486
Or whatever. I'm just...

322
00:15:41,354 --> 00:15:43,288
...trying to be funny.

323
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,689
No, that was good. Thank you.

324
00:15:48,727 --> 00:15:49,759
Oh, shit.

325
00:15:54,164 --> 00:15:56,131
I actually have to go.

326
00:15:56,133 --> 00:15:58,066
That's okay. Who was that?

327
00:15:58,068 --> 00:16:00,535
Sorry. Uh, that was Earl.

328
00:16:00,537 --> 00:16:01,577
Oh, who's Earl?

329
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:05,139
<i>You may remember Earl
from 15 minutes ago.</i>

330
00:16:05,141 --> 00:16:06,640
Titties.

331
00:16:06,642 --> 00:16:08,575
<i>So, some people think
Earl is my friend,</i>

332
00:16:08,577 --> 00:16:09,776
<i>but he's really not.</i>

333
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:11,677
<i>He's more like a coworker.</i>

334
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,311
<i>I've known him
since kindergarten.</i>

335
00:16:13,313 --> 00:16:15,680
<i>His house is
a short walk from mine,</i>

336
00:16:15,682 --> 00:16:17,648
<i>but in a much
tougher neighborhood.</i>

337
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:21,118
<i>His dad is in Texas, his mom
is a depressed shut-in.</i>

338
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,153
<i>And his brother
Derrick's dog Doopie</i>

339
00:16:23,155 --> 00:16:25,155
<i>will definitely eat me someday.</i>

340
00:16:27,124 --> 00:16:28,691
Doopie, Doopie, chill!

341
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,097
<i>So over the years we've
mostly hung out at my place.</i>

342
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:40,366
<i>Usually with my dad,
a tenured sociology professor.</i>

343
00:16:40,368 --> 00:16:42,601
What you got, cat?
You wanna fight?

344
00:16:42,603 --> 00:16:45,203
Didn't think so, punk-ass cat.

345
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,071
- Boys!
<i>- His job allows him</i>

346
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:48,572
<i>to be frequently at home
doing nothing.</i>

347
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,607
You'll want to pay
close attention to this.

348
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:53,610
The insane conquistador,
Aguirre,

349
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,278
is raging through the jungle...

350
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,847
...in search of a golden city
that doesn't exist.

351
00:16:57,849 --> 00:16:59,548
<i>The wrath of God.</i>

352
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:02,284
It's a classic
of foreign cinema.

353
00:17:02,286 --> 00:17:03,785
<i>Who else is with me?</i>

354
00:17:05,455 --> 00:17:06,787
<i>In addition to the best films...</i>

355
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:08,488
This is cuttlefish.

356
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,323
<i>...my house also has
the weirdest food.</i>

357
00:17:10,325 --> 00:17:12,325
A sea creature
much like a squid.

358
00:17:12,327 --> 00:17:14,860
It is a favorite East Asian
snack food.

359
00:17:14,862 --> 00:17:17,162
<i>Obviously we come from
pretty different backgrounds.</i>

360
00:17:17,164 --> 00:17:19,464
<i>But somehow, we like
most of the same things.</i>

361
00:17:19,466 --> 00:17:22,200
Yes, its smell is
odd and repellent

362
00:17:22,202 --> 00:17:23,668
to our Western noses.

363
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,170
<i>And we learned pretty early on</i>

364
00:17:26,172 --> 00:17:27,638
<i>that we were the only ones
who liked...</i>

365
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,407
<i>...for example,
classics of foreign cinema.</i>

366
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,643
<i>Why did we like them?</i>

367
00:17:33,645 --> 00:17:35,645
<i>It's hard to say.</i>

368
00:17:35,647 --> 00:17:37,380
<i>Maybe it's that they were
weird and often violent,</i>

369
00:17:37,382 --> 00:17:39,315
<i>like us.</i>

370
00:17:39,317 --> 00:17:41,817
<i>Or confusing and possibly
meaningless, like life.</i>

371
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:44,452
<i>You can't escape of
this stinkin' camp</i>

372
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:45,653
<i>because you never know
when they call you.</i>

373
00:17:45,655 --> 00:17:49,123
<i>Because you're paid for,
you're under contract.</i>

374
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,593
<i>Anyway,
we liked them so much</i>

375
00:17:53,595 --> 00:17:54,795
<i>we started making our own.</i>

376
00:17:55,662 --> 00:17:57,329
<i>Action!</i>

377
00:17:57,331 --> 00:17:59,197
<i>The idea behind
each one was...</i>

378
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:00,298
<i>...we took a film
that we liked</i>

379
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,799
<i>and made the title stupider.</i>

380
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:03,367
<i>And then made a new film</i>

381
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:05,202
<i>to reflect
the new stupid title.</i>

382
00:18:05,204 --> 00:18:07,204
<i>It's a formula that only
produces horrible films...</i>

383
00:18:07,206 --> 00:18:09,706
<i>...but for some reason
we keep using it.</i>

384
00:18:52,912 --> 00:18:55,313
<i>We've made 42 films.</i>

385
00:18:55,315 --> 00:18:56,881
<i>You'd think we'd have stopped
making them by now.</i>

386
00:18:56,883 --> 00:18:58,782
<i>But we haven't.</i>

387
00:18:58,784 --> 00:19:00,517
<i>Honestly, it's like
you can't go anywhere.</i>

388
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:03,319
<i>You can't escape this
stinking place...</i>

389
00:19:03,321 --> 00:19:04,920
<i>...because you don't know
when they call you...</i>

390
00:19:04,922 --> 00:19:08,623
<i>and you're paid to be here,
it's bullshit.</i>

391
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,524
<i>Yeah, and it's like, you know,</i>

392
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:12,692
<i>I can't do anything.
I'm not a free person.</i>

393
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:16,495
Truly, one of my favorites
from your oeuvre.

394
00:19:16,497 --> 00:19:19,331
A mature investigation
into the nature of violence.

395
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,633
Dad, for like
the billionth time,

396
00:19:21,635 --> 00:19:22,955
you're not allowed
to watch these.

397
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:25,536
I'm a fan.

398
00:19:27,639 --> 00:19:29,373
You gonna go see
that girl again?

399
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:33,276
I mean, probably, yeah.

400
00:19:33,278 --> 00:19:34,710
You gonna play
with them titties?

401
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:37,446
No. It's not like that.

402
00:19:37,448 --> 00:19:38,780
Well, that's not right.

403
00:19:38,782 --> 00:19:40,414
I mean, this could be
her last chance on Earth

404
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:41,748
to be with a man.

405
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,216
Don't make this about you.

406
00:19:43,218 --> 00:19:44,218
Earl!

407
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:47,453
First of all,
if it's that high-stakes,

408
00:19:47,455 --> 00:19:49,455
probably won't even be able
to get a boner.

409
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,457
Did I even say shit
about boners?

410
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:54,659
No.

411
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:58,262
What kind of cancer even is
acute myelogenous leukemia?

412
00:19:59,397 --> 00:20:01,631
You know, cancer of the, uh...

413
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:04,299
...the thing.

414
00:20:05,801 --> 00:20:07,902
<i>It's bullshit!</i>

415
00:20:07,904 --> 00:20:10,971
The Battle of Antietam was
the bloodiest day

416
00:20:10,973 --> 00:20:11,705
in American history.

417
00:20:11,707 --> 00:20:14,774
Class, what do you have to
say for yourselves?

418
00:20:14,776 --> 00:20:15,776
Respect the research.

419
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,477
That is what
I'm talking about!

420
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:21,278
All right, run for your lives.

421
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,160
Save yourselves.
Go, go, go, go, go.

422
00:20:23,613 --> 00:20:25,780
Good work today, everybody.

423
00:20:25,782 --> 00:20:28,616
Way to go. Bam.
Love it. Good stuff.

424
00:20:28,618 --> 00:20:30,551
Good job.
Excellent work today.

425
00:20:30,553 --> 00:20:32,486
Excellent. Nice job.
Hey, can I talk to you?

426
00:20:32,488 --> 00:20:33,487
Can I talk to you
for a second?

427
00:20:33,489 --> 00:20:35,555
Sure, Greg, what's up?

428
00:20:35,557 --> 00:20:39,025
Uh, do you know
any facts about leukemia?

429
00:20:39,027 --> 00:20:40,726
Leukemia?

430
00:20:40,728 --> 00:20:44,795
Yeah, it's a cancer of the
blood and/or bone marrow.

431
00:20:44,962 --> 00:20:46,662
Why?

432
00:20:46,664 --> 00:20:48,930
Right, so it's pretty
spread out in the body?

433
00:20:48,932 --> 00:20:50,765
That is a fact, yes.

434
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:53,400
How soon do
people die from it?

435
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:54,968
I think it's often
pretty treatable, bud.

436
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,636
Why do you ask?

437
00:20:56,638 --> 00:20:59,572
Well, you know Rachel Kushner
has leukemia, right?

438
00:20:59,574 --> 00:21:00,673
Wait, Rachel has what?

439
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,608
I'm, like,
innovatively stupid.

440
00:21:05,577 --> 00:21:08,045
Everyone was gonna find out
sooner or later.

441
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:10,380
Just hate having to share
everything about myself.

442
00:21:10,382 --> 00:21:11,622
I'm the exact same way.

443
00:21:12,315 --> 00:21:14,449
You know, one thing you can do

444
00:21:14,451 --> 00:21:15,716
if you don't want to
talk to anyone...

445
00:21:15,718 --> 00:21:17,598
...is just enter
a subhuman state.

446
00:21:19,754 --> 00:21:21,954
Here, pretend you're
someone annoying.

447
00:21:29,061 --> 00:21:30,561
"Hi, Rachel.

448
00:21:30,563 --> 00:21:32,003
"I'm really sorry
you have cancer."

449
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:46,841
Does that ever work?

450
00:21:46,843 --> 00:21:50,845
Yeah, of course.
It works all the time.

451
00:21:50,847 --> 00:21:53,080
It's called passive resistance.

452
00:21:53,082 --> 00:21:55,549
You know, that's what Gandhi
was all about.

453
00:21:55,551 --> 00:21:57,671
I'm pretty sure Gandhi
never did the subhuman thing.

454
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:03,489
That's how India achieved
statehood. Here, try it.

455
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:08,526
Nope.

456
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:09,768
Come on, it's easy.

457
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:14,898
Okay. Or another thing
you can do is just

458
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,399
flat-out pretend to be dead.

459
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:19,535
Say something annoying to me.

460
00:22:19,537 --> 00:22:20,537
Um...

461
00:22:22,438 --> 00:22:24,506
"Hey, Rachel. I just want you
to remember

462
00:22:24,508 --> 00:22:26,474
"that your cancer
is all part of God's plan."

463
00:22:33,114 --> 00:22:34,848
<i>Hey, asshole.</i>

464
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,182
<i>Yeah, over here.</i>

465
00:22:37,217 --> 00:22:38,817
<i>Just so we're straight on this,</i>

466
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:40,518
<i>you're advising
a girl with cancer...</i>

467
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,520
<i>...to pretend to be dead.</i>

468
00:22:43,722 --> 00:22:45,155
<i>No, seriously.</i>

469
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:47,090
<i>Think about what you're
doing here, dickhead.</i>

470
00:22:47,092 --> 00:22:48,724
<i>I've been doing
my broody Wolverine face on</i>

471
00:22:48,726 --> 00:22:50,025
<i>this girl's wall...</i>

472
00:22:50,027 --> 00:22:51,860
<i>...for five
and a quarter years,</i>

473
00:22:51,862 --> 00:22:53,161
<i>and at this point, I'm
probably only still here...</i>

474
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,795
<i>...because she'd feel
weirdly guilty</i>

475
00:22:54,797 --> 00:22:56,496
<i>or disloyal taking me down.</i>

476
00:22:56,498 --> 00:22:58,097
<i>But I'm goddamned
if I'm letting</i>

477
00:22:58,099 --> 00:22:59,631
<i>a little punk like you
waltz in here...</i>

478
00:22:59,633 --> 00:23:00,932
<i>...stupiding up the place!</i>

479
00:23:00,934 --> 00:23:02,166
<i>Not on my watch, pal.</i>

480
00:23:02,168 --> 00:23:03,200
Greg, what's wrong?

481
00:23:05,703 --> 00:23:07,003
I'm really sorry.

482
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:10,506
I shouldn't have told you
to pretend to be dead.

483
00:23:10,508 --> 00:23:11,940
That was really insensitive.

484
00:23:13,242 --> 00:23:14,976
I mean, I'm sick.
I'm not dying.

485
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:17,211
Yeah, I know, but I just...

486
00:23:17,213 --> 00:23:19,479
Now I'm being
all weird about it.

487
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,814
And I can't get un-weird,
'cause I just...

488
00:23:21,816 --> 00:23:23,248
Despite what you said,

489
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,083
I'm clearly still sitting here
thinking...

490
00:23:25,085 --> 00:23:27,445
..."death, death, death,
death, death, death."

491
00:23:39,262 --> 00:23:41,730
That's exactly
what I'm talking about!

492
00:23:44,199 --> 00:23:46,667
<i>So if this was
a touching romantic story...</i>

493
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:47,901
<i>...this is probably
where a new feeling</i>

494
00:23:47,903 --> 00:23:49,102
<i>would wash over me...</i>

495
00:23:49,104 --> 00:23:52,505
<i>and suddenly we would be
furiously making out...</i>

496
00:23:52,507 --> 00:23:54,467
<i>...with the fire
of a thousand suns.</i>

497
00:23:58,877 --> 00:24:00,878
<i>But this isn't
a touching romantic story.</i>

498
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,813
Anyway...
Yep.

499
00:24:02,815 --> 00:24:04,581
<i>But we did still become friends.</i>

500
00:24:12,156 --> 00:24:14,557
Daniel Craig's thing is,
he's got an accent, right?

501
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,293
So he's used to talking with
his mouth in a weird shape...

502
00:24:17,295 --> 00:24:19,695
...which is why he has
pouty lips, like a woman.

503
00:24:19,697 --> 00:24:22,564
Lickable technology, like,
I could text you a sandwich.

504
00:24:22,566 --> 00:24:26,768
There's a button on the nape
of his neck, under the skin.

505
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:29,103
Just push it
if you want him to stop.

506
00:24:29,105 --> 00:24:31,171
Do you believe animals
just live in our house,

507
00:24:31,173 --> 00:24:32,872
and everyone's cool with it?

508
00:24:32,874 --> 00:24:34,773
Like, real animals?

509
00:24:34,775 --> 00:24:36,875
Anyway. You talk now.

510
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,710
You mean, talk about cancer?

511
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:42,145
Only if you want to.

512
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,813
The hardest part is
watching my mom

513
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,816
trying to deal with it all.

514
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,551
And sometimes, I mean,
I do think if it ends up

515
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,853
that she's alone
in that house...

516
00:24:50,855 --> 00:24:52,588
She has no one. She and my dad
hate each other.

517
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,089
She has no siblings.

518
00:24:54,091 --> 00:24:55,623
I don't know what she'd do.

519
00:24:57,859 --> 00:24:59,226
Don't cry.

520
00:24:59,228 --> 00:25:01,828
I'm not crying.

521
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,030
Right, well, you know,
you can cry if you need to.

522
00:25:04,032 --> 00:25:05,752
I thought you said,
"Don't cry."

523
00:25:08,868 --> 00:25:10,235
Me and my dad used to
walk around the block

524
00:25:10,237 --> 00:25:12,770
and count squirrels.

525
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:14,705
Why? Did he work for, like,
the squirrel census?

526
00:25:14,707 --> 00:25:16,106
No, it was just
something we did

527
00:25:16,108 --> 00:25:18,341
when it was time for us
to spend time together.

528
00:25:18,343 --> 00:25:19,775
We didn't even say anything
while we did it.

529
00:25:19,777 --> 00:25:21,743
All we'd say was stuff like:

530
00:25:21,745 --> 00:25:24,779
"Squirrel, seven."
"Two squirrels, nine."

531
00:25:24,781 --> 00:25:28,582
Jesus. You need to apply
for a dad refund immediately.

532
00:25:28,584 --> 00:25:29,616
What group am I in?

533
00:25:29,618 --> 00:25:31,084
What?

534
00:25:31,086 --> 00:25:32,785
Yesterday you were
saying you'd mapped out

535
00:25:32,787 --> 00:25:33,919
the entire high school by group.

536
00:25:33,921 --> 00:25:35,320
What's my group?

537
00:25:35,322 --> 00:25:37,655
Seriously?
Yeah.

538
00:25:37,657 --> 00:25:40,924
Boring Jewish Senior Girls,
Subgroup 2-A.

539
00:25:42,294 --> 00:25:43,826
Please appreciate
how honest I was just now.

540
00:25:43,828 --> 00:25:44,828
You're an asshole.

541
00:25:45,828 --> 00:25:47,962
What group are you in?

542
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:51,131
Uh, I'm not
in a group, actually.

543
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,766
I just wouldn't belong to
a group that doesn't suck.

544
00:25:54,734 --> 00:25:57,368
You know,
I'm terminally awkward

545
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,103
and I have a face
like a little groundhog.

546
00:25:59,105 --> 00:26:00,370
So...

547
00:26:00,372 --> 00:26:02,071
You can't really think that.

548
00:26:02,939 --> 00:26:04,773
No, I don't think that.

549
00:26:04,775 --> 00:26:06,908
I know that.

550
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:10,011
I just feel like, you know,
for a kid like me...

551
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,715
...in high school,
best case scenario,

552
00:26:14,717 --> 00:26:16,383
just... survive. You know?

553
00:26:16,385 --> 00:26:19,352
Survive without creating
any mortal enemies...

554
00:26:19,354 --> 00:26:21,787
...or hideously embarrassing
yourself forever.

555
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,222
Just survive until college?

556
00:26:24,224 --> 00:26:27,024
College? No. God, college is
going to be even worse.

557
00:26:27,258 --> 00:26:29,025
What?

558
00:26:29,027 --> 00:26:31,761
I mean, at least high school,
it's over at 3:00...

559
00:26:31,763 --> 00:26:34,897
...and it's kids
I mostly know by now.

560
00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:36,765
But college is just gonna be
non-stop strangers.

561
00:26:36,767 --> 00:26:38,266
And some of them
even live in your room.

562
00:26:38,268 --> 00:26:40,801
It's like you can
literally never relax.

563
00:26:40,803 --> 00:26:43,069
I see myself dying of
a panic attack two weeks in.

564
00:26:44,004 --> 00:26:46,071
I might just not apply.

565
00:26:46,073 --> 00:26:48,740
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard you say.

566
00:26:48,742 --> 00:26:50,742
It's probably
not even top five.

567
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,912
And, you know,
high school, college,

568
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:56,213
we're forced to spend
these years of our lives...

569
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:58,248
...in randomly selected
groups of people

570
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,983
that we have nothing
in common with.

571
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:01,217
It's a nightmare.

572
00:27:02,252 --> 00:27:04,253
Anyone who says otherwise
is lying.

573
00:27:05,822 --> 00:27:07,155
Congratulations, Greg.

574
00:27:07,157 --> 00:27:08,322
Tomorrow,
you're eating lunch with

575
00:27:08,324 --> 00:27:10,857
Boring Jewish Senior Girls,
Subgroup 2-A.

576
00:27:14,727 --> 00:27:15,967
So where do you usually sit?

577
00:27:18,663 --> 00:27:21,023
It's literally like we're trying
to have lunch in Kandahar.

578
00:27:24,968 --> 00:27:28,003
Rachel, we just found out the
theme for this year's prom:

579
00:27:28,005 --> 00:27:29,971
"A Knight to Remember."

580
00:27:29,973 --> 00:27:31,973
Knight with a "K."
Medieval prom!

581
00:27:31,975 --> 00:27:34,175
Isn't prom like
six months away?

582
00:27:34,177 --> 00:27:35,342
Hi, guys. This is Greg,

583
00:27:35,344 --> 00:27:37,344
he's gonna be
sitting with us today.

584
00:27:37,346 --> 00:27:39,879
Anybody need any spoons? No?

585
00:27:42,148 --> 00:27:43,214
Hello.

586
00:27:45,684 --> 00:27:48,318
So, Greg, why are you
sitting with us today?

587
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,853
You know, it's lunch.

588
00:27:50,855 --> 00:27:53,088
You gotta eat somewhere.
Can't stand and eat.

589
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:56,024
You and Rachel seem very
friendly, all of a sudden.

590
00:27:56,191 --> 00:27:58,225
Yeah.

591
00:27:58,227 --> 00:27:59,793
You're only talking to her
because she has cancer.

592
00:27:59,795 --> 00:28:01,227
What?

593
00:28:01,229 --> 00:28:03,696
Greg, you hung out
with Rachel once.

594
00:28:03,698 --> 00:28:04,997
You're befriending her to
feel good about yourself.

595
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:06,398
No, I'm not.

596
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,400
Who even does that?

597
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,269
You guys mind
if I sit with you?

598
00:28:12,271 --> 00:28:13,271
Of course not.

599
00:28:16,072 --> 00:28:17,472
Sorry, it's a...

600
00:28:17,474 --> 00:28:19,140
It's a pillow.
It's meant to be a baby,

601
00:28:19,142 --> 00:28:20,975
for health class.

602
00:28:20,977 --> 00:28:22,142
You think it's safe here?

603
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,176
A pillow?

604
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,531
Greg, what do you think?

605
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,746
Mmm, I don't know.

606
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:29,114
Better not get it
too close to me,

607
00:28:29,116 --> 00:28:31,476
otherwise I might just
masturbate onto it.

608
00:28:32,851 --> 00:28:34,571
Ew, Greg,
that's just weird and gross.

609
00:28:39,256 --> 00:28:40,789
Hey, everyone,

610
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:43,024
check out Scott Mayhew's
Tyrannosaurus walk.

611
00:28:43,026 --> 00:28:45,226
It's a great way to get
from point A to point B.

612
00:28:45,727 --> 00:28:47,094
That was really mean, Greg.

613
00:28:47,096 --> 00:28:48,328
I think he heard you.

614
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:56,067
<i>And just like that...</i>

615
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,803
<i>...eight years
of carefully-cultivated</i>

616
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:02,105
<i>invisibility... gone.</i>

617
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,041
Fin.

618
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:07,442
Your mom made cookies?

619
00:29:07,444 --> 00:29:11,145
Nah, I won them off
of Ill Phil in a game of tonk.

620
00:29:11,147 --> 00:29:14,315
Got tired of whooping
your sorry ass.

621
00:29:14,317 --> 00:29:16,850
Why do they even call it
Scholar Horizons Biology?

622
00:29:16,852 --> 00:29:20,119
Maybe they should call it
Scholar Horizons Tonk.

623
00:29:20,121 --> 00:29:21,620
Or Sometimes Paper Football.

624
00:29:21,622 --> 00:29:23,288
Heathens.

625
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,810
What up?
Hi, Mr. McCarthy.

626
00:29:26,291 --> 00:29:27,291
Wow.

627
00:29:28,493 --> 00:29:32,295
Earl, fact,
that lunch is garbage.

628
00:29:32,297 --> 00:29:35,498
You're literally poisoning
yourself right in front of us.

629
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,266
At least I ain't eating
no funky ass

630
00:29:37,268 --> 00:29:39,968
seaweed-looking tentacle soup.

631
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,603
Seriously, this stuff
is the business.

632
00:29:42,605 --> 00:29:44,905
It's Vietnamese.
It's called Pho.

633
00:29:44,907 --> 00:29:46,940
It is "Pho-nomenal."

634
00:29:46,942 --> 00:29:48,142
Well, let me try
some one time.

635
00:29:48,241 --> 00:29:49,241
Mmm.

636
00:29:50,609 --> 00:29:52,309
Now you want to try some?
Yeah.

637
00:29:52,311 --> 00:29:54,077
Well, no.

638
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:56,345
It's strictly forbidden for me
to give you food.

639
00:29:56,347 --> 00:29:57,479
However, if you go to...

640
00:29:59,248 --> 00:30:01,582
...Thuyen's Super
Saigon Flavor

641
00:30:01,584 --> 00:30:03,183
over in Lawrenceville...

642
00:30:03,185 --> 00:30:05,151
...and ask for Thuyen.

643
00:30:05,153 --> 00:30:07,619
Tell him to put it on my tab.
You'll be all set.

644
00:30:10,623 --> 00:30:13,091
I ain't going to
no damn Lawrenceville.

645
00:30:13,093 --> 00:30:14,358
Fair enough.

646
00:30:16,661 --> 00:30:18,327
You'll have to excuse me.

647
00:30:21,964 --> 00:30:23,297
Boys.

648
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:24,998
Respect the research.

649
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Respect!

650
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:34,571
God! You know,
people just assume that

651
00:30:34,573 --> 00:30:36,272
Rachel and I are dating.

652
00:30:36,274 --> 00:30:37,906
It's ruining my life.

653
00:30:37,908 --> 00:30:40,575
Today I threatened to
sexually assault a fake baby.

654
00:30:40,577 --> 00:30:43,210
And I became mortal enemies
with Scott Mayhew.

655
00:30:43,212 --> 00:30:45,452
Both of which
are Rachel's fault.

656
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,114
Sorry, but they just are.

657
00:30:48,116 --> 00:30:51,016
Of course I'm a dick
for complaining about it.

658
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:53,258
I mean, I am a dick
for complaining about it.

659
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:55,954
I didn't actually mean
any of that.

660
00:30:55,956 --> 00:30:57,388
Better play with them titties.

661
00:31:02,326 --> 00:31:04,806
Does this taste strange to you?

662
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,147
<i>The soup had drugs.</i>

663
00:32:08,318 --> 00:32:09,350
Whoa!

664
00:32:14,622 --> 00:32:16,155
McCarthy must've
put weed in that soup

665
00:32:16,157 --> 00:32:17,456
because my brain
is trying to eat itself.

666
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:19,090
Oh, my God.

667
00:32:19,092 --> 00:32:20,458
I have to go visit
Rachel right now.

668
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,193
Okay, well, you do that.

669
00:32:22,195 --> 00:32:24,261
I'ma be at your house
eatin' up all your dad's food.

670
00:32:24,263 --> 00:32:26,096
No! You have to
come help!

671
00:32:26,098 --> 00:32:27,263
Help with what?

672
00:32:27,265 --> 00:32:28,265
Help!

673
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,167
Hey, in class,
do McCarthy act all, like,

674
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:34,434
stoned and shit?

675
00:32:35,402 --> 00:32:37,302
Uh, I don't know.
I guess.

676
00:32:37,304 --> 00:32:38,736
Yeah, sometimes.

677
00:32:38,738 --> 00:32:40,637
Well, not sometimes,

678
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:42,138
but you know what I'm...
You know how he is.

679
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,206
Goddamn, son.

680
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:46,308
You can't even put a full damn
sentence together.

681
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:49,244
It's insane that Mr. McCarthy
eats soup with drugs in it.

682
00:32:49,246 --> 00:32:51,479
Hey, come on, man,
keep your damn voice down.

683
00:33:04,092 --> 00:33:05,692
We can't tell anyone
we're on drugs.

684
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:07,093
Why the hell not?

685
00:33:09,496 --> 00:33:11,263
Because then they'll know.

686
00:33:30,614 --> 00:33:33,382
It's my humble little mouse.

687
00:33:33,384 --> 00:33:35,417
And who is
his little mouse friend?

688
00:33:37,386 --> 00:33:40,054
Earl Jackson.

689
00:33:40,056 --> 00:33:43,524
Earl's just my coworker,
and, uh, he's a great guy.

690
00:33:43,526 --> 00:33:45,659
We were just walking around
the neighborhood, you know.

691
00:33:45,661 --> 00:33:48,495
Not really doing anything,

692
00:33:48,497 --> 00:33:50,096
and just wanted
to come say "What's up?"

693
00:33:50,098 --> 00:33:52,331
'Cause Rachel's
about to lose her hair.

694
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:53,799
Mmm.
So, just wanted to say,

695
00:33:53,801 --> 00:33:57,435
you know,
"Bye, hair. Good riddance."

696
00:33:57,437 --> 00:34:00,137
She's gonna look great without
hair. That's a fact, so...

697
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:02,105
Yeah, I just wanted to say
what's up.

698
00:34:02,107 --> 00:34:05,141
Rachel! We've got
two cute little mouse boys

699
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:07,023
on our doorstep
that wanna say hi!

700
00:34:10,146 --> 00:34:14,415
Would you two... mice
like a little bit of cheese?

701
00:34:18,486 --> 00:34:19,606
Okay.

702
00:34:26,793 --> 00:34:29,427
I like your room, Rachel.

703
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:31,729
Thanks. Greg thinks
it's too girly.

704
00:34:31,731 --> 00:34:34,364
No, I love girly,
I think it's fine.

705
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:35,732
Well,
it ain't too girly.

706
00:34:35,734 --> 00:34:38,534
"Yo, this some
pink puffy bullshit."

707
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:40,269
I mean, Hello Kitty posters

708
00:34:40,271 --> 00:34:42,537
and chocolate and naked dudes
all over the wall.

709
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:44,672
They make me want to
throw up for real.

710
00:34:44,674 --> 00:34:47,174
Hey, if you're gonna throw up,
don't do it in here, okay?

711
00:34:47,176 --> 00:34:48,176
This is her room.

712
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,611
Anyways.

713
00:34:51,613 --> 00:34:53,933
Rachel, we really just wanted
to see how you was doin'.

714
00:34:54,314 --> 00:34:55,714
Thanks.

715
00:34:55,716 --> 00:34:58,383
Yeah, chemotherapy.
That really sucks.

716
00:34:58,385 --> 00:34:59,385
Greg.

717
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:03,554
What the hell, bro?
Don't say it suck, dumb-ass!

718
00:35:03,556 --> 00:35:05,589
It does kinda suck.

719
00:35:05,591 --> 00:35:07,490
Yeah, but I mean, you gotta do
what you gotta do.

720
00:35:07,492 --> 00:35:08,624
Yeah, I guess.

721
00:35:10,593 --> 00:35:11,593
Um...

722
00:35:14,129 --> 00:35:15,662
Uh...

723
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:17,230
Look, you guys can go
if you want.

724
00:35:17,232 --> 00:35:18,731
We're on drugs.
Oh, shit!

725
00:35:18,733 --> 00:35:20,432
Why are you on drugs?

726
00:35:20,434 --> 00:35:21,800
Well, we're accidentally
on drugs.

727
00:35:21,802 --> 00:35:23,301
"Accidentally"?

728
00:35:23,303 --> 00:35:25,269
McCarthy gave us some soup.

729
00:35:25,271 --> 00:35:27,504
Well, McCarthy gave us
some of his,

730
00:35:27,506 --> 00:35:29,439
you know, just regular,
normal soup...

731
00:35:29,441 --> 00:35:30,506
...but then, it was
the last of the soup

732
00:35:30,508 --> 00:35:31,607
so we had to
go get some more...

733
00:35:31,609 --> 00:35:33,675
...from a restaurant,

734
00:35:33,677 --> 00:35:35,443
on the fifth floor
of an office building.

735
00:35:35,445 --> 00:35:36,877
And in the same building,

736
00:35:36,879 --> 00:35:38,245
there was a Jamaican embassy...

737
00:35:38,247 --> 00:35:40,780
...and we ended up
getting trapped

738
00:35:40,782 --> 00:35:42,515
in an elevator
with a Rastafarian guy...

739
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:45,317
...and he just hotboxed
the whole elevator, so...

740
00:35:45,319 --> 00:35:47,852
We were stuck in there
for, like, 25 minutes...

741
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:48,786
...and we had to breathe
the weird marijuana air.

742
00:35:48,788 --> 00:35:50,687
Earl, am I right?

743
00:35:50,689 --> 00:35:51,889
That's exactly what happened.

744
00:35:52,922 --> 00:35:55,590
You guys had
quite an adventure.

745
00:35:55,592 --> 00:35:58,225
Being on drugs
just really sucks.

746
00:35:58,227 --> 00:36:00,193
Being around people
on drugs sucks.

747
00:36:00,195 --> 00:36:03,663
This whole situation, really
sorry, just sucks. I'm sorry.

748
00:36:03,665 --> 00:36:06,232
Yo, yo. What the hell
is your problem, man?

749
00:36:06,234 --> 00:36:07,700
All apologetic and shit,

750
00:36:07,702 --> 00:36:09,201
making shit
'bout your sorry ass.

751
00:36:09,203 --> 00:36:11,303
Look, that's not what we came
here to do. Okay?

752
00:36:11,305 --> 00:36:12,504
You wanna help,
you gonna take this girl out

753
00:36:12,506 --> 00:36:13,872
to get some ice cream.

754
00:36:14,874 --> 00:36:16,875
And me, too,
'cause I love that shit.

755
00:36:16,877 --> 00:36:18,209
You like ice cream?

756
00:36:18,211 --> 00:36:19,877
Yeah.

757
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:21,545
So, you know
Greg from class?

758
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,881
I've known Greg
ever since we were little.

759
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:26,616
You know, I was in
y'all kindergarten, right?

760
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:28,317
Really?

761
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:29,851
Mmm-hmm. I remember you.

762
00:36:29,853 --> 00:36:31,886
You was the girl who called
Justin Jones perverted...

763
00:36:31,888 --> 00:36:34,321
...for showing girls
the birthmark on his butt.

764
00:36:34,323 --> 00:36:35,323
Oh, my God, yes!

765
00:36:35,923 --> 00:36:37,924
Yeah, dude came running up,

766
00:36:37,926 --> 00:36:40,026
showed you his butt.
You were calm.

767
00:36:40,028 --> 00:36:42,595
Said, "Justin, only perverts
show their butts."

768
00:36:42,597 --> 00:36:43,796
I was right there.

769
00:36:43,798 --> 00:36:45,898
I can't believe
you remember that.

770
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,001
You a hero. Shut his
perverted ass right down.

771
00:36:49,003 --> 00:36:50,402
I never forget it.

772
00:36:51,437 --> 00:36:53,538
So you and Greg are coworkers?

773
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,039
Naw, we friends.

774
00:36:55,041 --> 00:36:57,641
He just hates calling people
his friend. Dude's got issues.

775
00:36:57,643 --> 00:37:00,410
Yeah, he does.
What's going on?

776
00:37:00,412 --> 00:37:02,812
Man, I don't even know.
It might be his folks.

777
00:37:02,814 --> 00:37:04,747
I mean, dude's mom
always tellin' him

778
00:37:04,749 --> 00:37:06,882
how handsome he is,
which he ain't.

779
00:37:06,884 --> 00:37:09,584
So now he think he can't trust
anybody close to him.

780
00:37:09,586 --> 00:37:11,018
Dude's weird-ass dad

781
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,487
don't socialize with anybody
'cept the cat.

782
00:37:13,489 --> 00:37:15,956
So that's a role model
ain't got no friends.

783
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:17,724
Bottom line, dude's terrified

784
00:37:17,726 --> 00:37:19,726
of callin' somebody
his friend...

785
00:37:19,728 --> 00:37:21,928
...and they sayin', "Hey, bro,
I'm not your friend."

786
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,429
Then he'd have to kill himself.

787
00:37:23,431 --> 00:37:25,397
But how are you coworkers?

788
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:27,732
We, um, we make films.

789
00:37:27,999 --> 00:37:29,833
Movies?

790
00:37:29,835 --> 00:37:32,602
Yeah. We been making them
for a few years now.

791
00:37:32,604 --> 00:37:34,470
We have, like, 42 in total.

792
00:37:34,938 --> 00:37:36,872
Greg! You never told me.

793
00:37:36,874 --> 00:37:38,406
Well, we never told
anybody 'bout them.

794
00:37:38,408 --> 00:37:40,408
They suck.
I mean, they're terrible.

795
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,610
I'm pretty sure they don't suck.

796
00:37:42,612 --> 00:37:44,532
Well, you can see
for yourself if you want.

797
00:37:44,879 --> 00:37:46,412
Are you sure?

798
00:37:46,414 --> 00:37:47,413
Hell, yeah,
don't even worry about it.

799
00:37:47,415 --> 00:37:48,580
Just don't tell nobody.

800
00:37:48,582 --> 00:37:49,662
No, of course,
I won't.

801
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:52,716
All right, son,
get on your feet.

802
00:37:52,718 --> 00:37:53,718
Sounds good.

803
00:37:54,584 --> 00:37:55,850
Where are we going?

804
00:38:23,573 --> 00:38:24,940
We can walk you home.

805
00:38:24,942 --> 00:38:26,374
He needs to recover,

806
00:38:26,376 --> 00:38:28,296
and you probably
should look after him.

807
00:38:29,644 --> 00:38:30,844
Peace, peace.

808
00:38:30,846 --> 00:38:32,686
Thanks.
Bye.

809
00:38:35,548 --> 00:38:37,649
Goddamn it, Earl.

810
00:38:37,651 --> 00:38:39,450
Son, don't even start.

811
00:38:39,452 --> 00:38:40,651
Pig's foot.

812
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:48,424
<i>So, we're pretty far
into this stupid story now...</i>

813
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:50,726
<i>...and you're probably
saying to yourself,</i>

814
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,694
<i>"Hey. I like this girl Rachel.</i>

815
00:38:52,696 --> 00:38:55,463
<i>"And I'm gonna be pissed
if she dies at the end."</i>

816
00:38:55,465 --> 00:38:58,499
<i>don't freak out. She survives.</i>

817
00:38:59,734 --> 00:39:01,735
<i>So, hopefully,
that reassures you.</i>

818
00:39:03,671 --> 00:39:05,938
<i>Although, actually,
why would it?</i>

819
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:09,074
I'm just overwhelmed
with your enthusiasm today.

820
00:39:09,076 --> 00:39:10,542
I guess we're just gonna have
to do it

821
00:39:10,544 --> 00:39:12,043
the old-fashioned way.

822
00:39:12,878 --> 00:39:14,678
I'm thinking of one of you.

823
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,079
I'm not gonna mention
any names,

824
00:39:16,081 --> 00:39:17,914
but your initials...

825
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:19,649
...are Scott Mayhew.

826
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:21,684
Greg's been telling everyone

827
00:39:21,686 --> 00:39:23,152
your soup has marijuana in it.

828
00:39:23,154 --> 00:39:25,020
I didn't tell anyone.

829
00:39:25,022 --> 00:39:26,621
I heard you bellowing about it
on public transit.

830
00:39:26,623 --> 00:39:28,122
Is that a fact, Greg?

831
00:39:30,859 --> 00:39:33,961
Look, yesterday,
Earl and I got stoned somehow.

832
00:39:33,963 --> 00:39:35,829
And it was after
we both ate your soup.

833
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,063
And we didn't smoke
any marijuana,

834
00:39:37,065 --> 00:39:38,898
which I have never done, so...

835
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,199
Your soup
must have drugs in it,

836
00:39:40,201 --> 00:39:41,867
'cause that was the only thing
we both ate...

837
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:43,468
...other than some cookies
we got from Ill Phil,

838
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,769
the drug dealer.

839
00:39:46,438 --> 00:39:48,739
Aha.

840
00:39:48,741 --> 00:39:51,074
Man, how did you not know
it was the cookies?

841
00:39:51,076 --> 00:39:54,010
Man, it was your dumb ass
yelling that shit on the bus.

842
00:39:54,012 --> 00:39:55,578
Yo, Greg!

843
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,179
Did you snitch on me?

844
00:39:57,181 --> 00:39:58,613
He did snitch on you!

845
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:00,781
I was there.

846
00:40:00,783 --> 00:40:02,749
I heard you ridiculing me

847
00:40:02,751 --> 00:40:04,111
in front of
your loathsome harem.

848
00:40:04,951 --> 00:40:08,053
You have made...
a mortal enemy.

849
00:40:08,055 --> 00:40:09,954
And I will never stop
hounding you.

850
00:40:09,956 --> 00:40:12,489
Yeah, you made two mortal
enemies. I stabbed a dude.

851
00:40:12,491 --> 00:40:13,957
Jesus.

852
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:48,586
So they haven't really
done anything.

853
00:40:48,588 --> 00:40:50,788
It's been about a month now.

854
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:53,524
They did say they're never
gonna stop hounding me...

855
00:40:53,526 --> 00:40:56,059
...so, sooner or later...
you know...

856
00:40:56,061 --> 00:40:57,193
...gonna get hounded.

857
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:03,098
Sorry, next time
I'll bring you some flowers.

858
00:41:04,967 --> 00:41:07,034
Though I don't even know
where I'd put them.

859
00:41:07,036 --> 00:41:09,276
It's like, like the only place
left is the barf bucket.

860
00:41:12,238 --> 00:41:13,805
Flowers.

861
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:16,841
Where you barf.

862
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,113
I like that hat.

863
00:41:26,015 --> 00:41:27,248
It's pretty cute.

864
00:41:32,254 --> 00:41:36,824
Look, I've never been
very beautiful...

865
00:41:36,826 --> 00:41:39,726
...and that's fine because
that's not important to me.

866
00:41:40,027 --> 00:41:41,193
But...

867
00:41:44,263 --> 00:41:45,963
I thought it'd be
easier looking like this.

868
00:41:45,965 --> 00:41:47,097
It's just not.

869
00:41:50,067 --> 00:41:53,102
Everyone comes in here
and sees me...

870
00:41:53,104 --> 00:41:55,070
...and they're
so clearly repulsed.

871
00:41:56,872 --> 00:41:58,872
It's so much harder
than I thought it would be.

872
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,673
Hey, come on.

873
00:42:01,074 --> 00:42:02,607
You look good.

874
00:42:02,609 --> 00:42:06,877
I'm ugly, Greg! I'm so ugly.

875
00:42:06,879 --> 00:42:08,845
Everyone feels like they have
to lie to me and no one

876
00:42:08,847 --> 00:42:11,547
realizes how insulting that is.

877
00:42:11,549 --> 00:42:13,549
Everyone thinks they're
helping, and they're not.

878
00:42:29,197 --> 00:42:30,297
Here.

879
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:32,999
That one's called <i>Mono Rash.</i>

880
00:42:33,001 --> 00:42:35,234
It's based on <i>Rashomon</i>
by Kurosawa.

881
00:42:35,236 --> 00:42:36,668
Plot's basically
just Earl killing people

882
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,069
'cause he has a rash...

883
00:42:38,071 --> 00:42:40,352
...from mono,
you know, the STD.

884
00:42:42,305 --> 00:42:45,173
Anyway, we're supposed
to go work on

885
00:42:45,175 --> 00:42:47,608
our homage to <i>Apocalypse Now.</i>

886
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:49,676
Ours is called
<i>A Box O' Lips, Wow,</i>

887
00:42:49,678 --> 00:42:51,558
which is even worse
than <i>Mono Rash.</i>

888
00:42:51,978 --> 00:42:54,079
It's a war movie
where these two guys

889
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:55,747
take part in the unspeakable
brutality of war...

890
00:42:55,749 --> 00:42:58,015
...and then they find
a box of tulips.

891
00:42:58,017 --> 00:43:00,250
Box O' Lips, yeah.
And they're just, "Wow."

892
00:43:00,252 --> 00:43:02,318
They can't get over
how great these tulips are,

893
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,360
it's like,
"A box o' lips, wow!"

894
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,320
The worst part is,
tulips might not

895
00:43:06,322 --> 00:43:07,821
even be in the budget anymore.

896
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:11,691
I should actually
just stay here

897
00:43:11,693 --> 00:43:12,933
and keep you
from watching that.

898
00:43:13,259 --> 00:43:15,827
No! I'm fine. Go make it.

899
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:17,029
Okay.

900
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,297
Okay. Have fun watching

901
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:23,232
this incredibly terrible movie.

902
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:25,334
Mmm. Have fun

903
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:27,376
making the next one.
Mmm-hmm.

904
00:43:49,891 --> 00:43:51,925
Hey, white boy!

905
00:43:51,927 --> 00:43:53,459
Why don't you make me a tulip
'fore I have Doopie come down

906
00:43:53,461 --> 00:43:55,060
there and eat your face?

907
00:43:56,262 --> 00:43:58,296
But no, for real.
Can you make me a tulip?

908
00:43:58,298 --> 00:44:00,031
Oh, my God!
Am I on set right now?

909
00:44:00,033 --> 00:44:01,399
Oh, damn!
Oh, my God!

910
00:44:01,401 --> 00:44:04,101
Ahh! I can't take it!
Action! Cut!

911
00:44:05,269 --> 00:44:07,837
Madison, why are you here?

912
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,305
Rachel said that
I could find you here...

913
00:44:09,307 --> 00:44:11,173
...and your phone was going
straight to voice mail.

914
00:44:11,175 --> 00:44:13,341
Probably 'cause there ain't
no good service down there!

915
00:44:13,343 --> 00:44:15,343
But I had to get here
'cause I had to let you know.

916
00:44:15,345 --> 00:44:18,012
So, I was visiting Rachel,
and I was giving her a card...

917
00:44:18,014 --> 00:44:20,347
...and she was watching
one of your secret movies.

918
00:44:20,349 --> 00:44:21,948
Oh, my God.
Wait, did you see any of it?

919
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,316
No! No, she turned it
off immediately.

920
00:44:23,318 --> 00:44:24,950
It was good, it was good.

921
00:44:24,952 --> 00:44:26,184
You know,
you're both Japanese, and...

922
00:44:26,186 --> 00:44:27,852
...Earl beheaded you,
and, but then,

923
00:44:27,854 --> 00:44:29,520
she, like, turned it off.

924
00:44:29,522 --> 00:44:32,055
But I had a brainstorm. Okay?
I had an amazing brainstorm.

925
00:44:32,057 --> 00:44:35,157
I realized... you need to
make a film for Rachel.

926
00:44:36,526 --> 00:44:39,160
What do you think?

927
00:44:39,162 --> 00:44:41,095
It would be like her favorite
thing in the entire world...

928
00:44:41,097 --> 00:44:43,257
...and it's like the most
important thing you could do.

929
00:44:43,298 --> 00:44:44,831
You have to do it.

930
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:50,402
Yeah, word.

931
00:44:50,404 --> 00:44:52,504
"Word"? Like, word,
you'll do it, word?

932
00:45:00,277 --> 00:45:01,810
Yep.

933
00:45:01,812 --> 00:45:03,044
Oh, my God, awesome!

934
00:45:03,046 --> 00:45:04,311
Okay, well,
I can't wait to see it.

935
00:45:04,313 --> 00:45:05,553
Um, okay, I gotta go, but...

936
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,500
Cut!

937
00:45:08,348 --> 00:45:09,588
That's a wrap!

938
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,015
Rolling!

939
00:45:12,016 --> 00:45:13,316
Titties.

940
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:14,784
Goddamn it!

941
00:45:15,452 --> 00:45:17,052
<i>In the next few weeks,</i>

942
00:45:17,054 --> 00:45:19,254
<i>did I start
making that movie? No.</i>

943
00:45:19,256 --> 00:45:21,189
<i>Because I didn't agree
to make that movie.</i>

944
00:45:21,191 --> 00:45:23,324
<i>All I said was, "Word."</i>

945
00:45:23,326 --> 00:45:25,326
<i>"Word" could mean anything.</i>

946
00:45:25,328 --> 00:45:26,794
<i>Plus, we had at least
a month or two...</i>

947
00:45:26,796 --> 00:45:30,230
<i>all the terrible films
we'd already made.</i>

948
00:45:30,232 --> 00:45:33,099
<i>For example,</i>
A Sockwork Orange.

949
00:45:58,324 --> 00:45:59,423
"Droogle"?

950
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,591
It's Google for droogs.

951
00:46:03,826 --> 00:46:05,960
What's that?

952
00:46:05,962 --> 00:46:07,602
Nothing, just the bane
of my existence.

953
00:46:09,431 --> 00:46:11,131
Which my mom is forcing me
to carry around

954
00:46:11,133 --> 00:46:12,432
until I apply
to some colleges.

955
00:46:14,168 --> 00:46:15,935
She says it's like a menu

956
00:46:15,937 --> 00:46:17,002
for my future,
and I was, like, "Sure.

957
00:46:17,004 --> 00:46:19,137
"A menu that only has food

958
00:46:19,139 --> 00:46:21,372
"that will humiliate me
for four years."

959
00:46:21,374 --> 00:46:25,142
You have to be less
of an idiot about college.

960
00:46:25,144 --> 00:46:27,377
Listen, even if you think
people won't like you...

961
00:46:27,379 --> 00:46:30,480
...which is literally
an insane thing to think...

962
00:46:30,482 --> 00:46:32,281
...you're way less exposed
to people in college.

963
00:46:32,283 --> 00:46:35,050
High school is 40 hours
of class a week.

964
00:46:35,052 --> 00:46:38,019
College is, like, 15 and 20.

965
00:46:38,021 --> 00:46:39,153
And if you don't want to
live with other people,

966
00:46:39,155 --> 00:46:41,455
then go to Pittsburgh State.

967
00:46:41,457 --> 00:46:43,523
Live at home.

968
00:46:43,525 --> 00:46:46,392
It's better than
sitting college out

969
00:46:46,394 --> 00:46:47,914
because you irrationally
hate yourself.

970
00:46:48,261 --> 00:46:50,328
Not irrationally, though.

971
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:51,595
Apply to Pittsburgh State.

972
00:46:52,863 --> 00:46:56,031
Right now. Apply early.

973
00:46:56,033 --> 00:46:59,000
Come on. Do it in front of me.
Apply to Pittsburgh State.

974
00:46:59,002 --> 00:47:00,242
What if I say no?

975
00:47:02,036 --> 00:47:03,970
I have stage four cancer.

976
00:47:06,306 --> 00:47:08,373
So that would be a pretty
dick move. Come on.

977
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:09,375
Fine.

978
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,282
"Why I want to
go... to college."

979
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:26,487
By Werner Herzog.

980
00:47:28,356 --> 00:47:29,456
The highly selective

981
00:47:29,458 --> 00:47:31,357
admissions process...

982
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:34,360
...weeds out the cruel
and the stupid.

983
00:47:34,362 --> 00:47:37,930
So college is unlike
the senseless chaos...

984
00:47:37,932 --> 00:47:41,500
...and sickening enormity
of high school.

985
00:47:41,502 --> 00:47:44,936
High school is the mouth
of a great demon...

986
00:47:44,938 --> 00:47:46,671
...biting and chewing

987
00:47:46,673 --> 00:47:48,105
and smushing people in the face.

988
00:47:49,474 --> 00:47:52,108
It is simply overwhelming.

989
00:47:55,946 --> 00:47:57,613
In all seriousness,

990
00:47:57,615 --> 00:47:59,581
I am looking forward
to college...

991
00:47:59,583 --> 00:48:02,350
...because I didn't really
fit in in high school,

992
00:48:02,352 --> 00:48:03,184
because of my weird
rodent face...

993
00:48:03,186 --> 00:48:04,685
No.

994
00:48:04,687 --> 00:48:07,454
...and a habit of saying
the dumbest possible shit.

995
00:48:07,456 --> 00:48:09,088
No!

996
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:12,157
The sheer pastiness
of my complexion...

997
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:16,294
...overwhelms all who behold
it with existential nausea.

998
00:48:16,296 --> 00:48:20,564
"In high school, I never
truly felt comfortable...

999
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:22,966
"...in my own skin.

1000
00:48:22,968 --> 00:48:25,068
"In fact,
I've always been someone...

1001
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:29,605
"...who doesn't
really like themselves.

1002
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:33,709
"But I think that's because I
have some growing up to do...

1003
00:48:33,711 --> 00:48:37,578
"...and college is the place
where I'm going to do it."

1004
00:48:41,115 --> 00:48:42,415
That's way too personal.

1005
00:48:46,653 --> 00:48:48,053
Fine, if you want to
see this again...

1006
00:48:48,055 --> 00:48:49,587
Okay! Okay!

1007
00:48:50,589 --> 00:48:52,723
But only because cancer.

1008
00:48:54,192 --> 00:48:56,526
And you know what? You have to
do this too now. Here.

1009
00:48:57,561 --> 00:48:59,228
Page through this huge,
horrible book

1010
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:00,495
and find some colleges.

1011
00:49:00,497 --> 00:49:01,737
That's yours now.

1012
00:49:03,131 --> 00:49:05,412
Mmm. It's like a menu
for your future.

1013
00:49:09,469 --> 00:49:11,336
Can I finish my movie first?

1014
00:51:32,726 --> 00:51:34,560
So,
if we make this film,

1015
00:51:34,562 --> 00:51:35,642
people are gonna be, like:

1016
00:51:36,095 --> 00:51:37,328
"Oh, Greg and Earl,

1017
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:39,129
"they're those weird filmmakers.

1018
00:51:39,131 --> 00:51:40,864
"They're always
creepily filming stuff.

1019
00:51:40,866 --> 00:51:42,465
"They'll probably sneak into
your house one night

1020
00:51:42,467 --> 00:51:43,833
"and film you
while you're sleeping."

1021
00:51:43,835 --> 00:51:45,334
But people probably
already think that,

1022
00:51:45,336 --> 00:51:48,837
So now, I've become
completely conspicuous,

1023
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:50,405
like all the time.

1024
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:51,739
People look at me and think,

1025
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:53,107
"Filmmaker."
The hell even is this?

1026
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:54,108
When they're not
already thinking,

1027
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,342
"Cancer girl's boyfriend."

1028
00:51:55,344 --> 00:51:56,609
It tastes like a dog's
funky-ass butthole.

1029
00:51:56,611 --> 00:51:58,211
Furthermore,
we agreed to do a film

1030
00:51:58,213 --> 00:51:59,645
that we have no idea
what it should look like...

1031
00:51:59,647 --> 00:52:01,647
...or sound like, or even be.

1032
00:52:01,649 --> 00:52:02,748
I mean,
what the hell sort of film

1033
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:04,916
should we even make? Huh?

1034
00:52:04,918 --> 00:52:06,918
I mean, what was I thinking?

1035
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:07,919
You were thinking
that girl Madison

1036
00:52:07,921 --> 00:52:09,420
had nice titties.

1037
00:52:09,422 --> 00:52:10,621
I mean,
I like the titties too,

1038
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:12,489
but now you got a problem.

1039
00:52:12,491 --> 00:52:13,756
'Cause I ain't agreed
to do this shit.

1040
00:52:13,758 --> 00:52:14,758
You did.

1041
00:52:16,659 --> 00:52:18,726
Are you not gonna
help me make this?

1042
00:52:18,728 --> 00:52:20,761
The hell we gonna make, son?

1043
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:23,363
<i>They want fresh inspiration.</i>

1044
00:52:23,365 --> 00:52:24,731
I must tell you,
the richest inspiration

1045
00:52:24,733 --> 00:52:26,833
I have ever known was...

1046
00:52:26,835 --> 00:52:29,335
...during my period of
quarantine in the Amazon.

1047
00:52:30,571 --> 00:52:32,370
Where I
and a half dozen other...

1048
00:52:32,372 --> 00:52:34,705
...unfortunates
had nothing to watch...

1049
00:52:34,707 --> 00:52:38,608
...but the bristling,
leviathan tarantula...

1050
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:41,777
...bunched up on
the rotting, flimsy thatch...

1051
00:52:41,779 --> 00:52:43,659
...perhaps eight feet
above our faces.

1052
00:52:44,346 --> 00:52:47,414
Spiders the size of your fist.

1053
00:52:47,416 --> 00:52:49,883
Their fangs glistening
with venom and...

1054
00:52:49,885 --> 00:52:51,684
...their thousand-fold
black eyes

1055
00:52:51,686 --> 00:52:53,986
shining dully in the gloom.

1056
00:52:53,988 --> 00:52:55,454
In the darkness,
you would hear

1057
00:52:55,456 --> 00:52:57,456
the sudden anguished hiss...

1058
00:52:57,458 --> 00:53:00,392
...of a spider being struck
by an adult leopard wasp...

1059
00:53:00,394 --> 00:53:01,693
...and in their
mortal struggle,

1060
00:53:01,695 --> 00:53:02,994
they would plummet
to one's bed...

1061
00:53:02,996 --> 00:53:05,629
...biting and stinging
and thrashing...

1062
00:53:07,598 --> 00:53:09,438
You know that you can
smoke a hornet?

1063
00:53:11,334 --> 00:53:13,635
Okay, so just look at me
when you answer the questions.

1064
00:53:13,637 --> 00:53:15,437
Don't worry
about the camera, all right?

1065
00:53:16,571 --> 00:53:18,705
Okay, Denise.

1066
00:53:18,707 --> 00:53:20,988
Tell me a little
about Rachel's birth.

1067
00:53:21,308 --> 00:53:22,775
Uh, Rachel's birth.

1068
00:53:23,543 --> 00:53:24,976
What an ordeal that was.

1069
00:53:27,645 --> 00:53:30,013
Greg, just...
let me tell you one thing.

1070
00:53:31,582 --> 00:53:33,015
I was a really good mom
to her, you know?

1071
00:53:33,017 --> 00:53:35,283
I really was.

1072
00:53:35,285 --> 00:53:37,685
Some single moms,
their kids grow up too fast...

1073
00:53:37,687 --> 00:53:39,453
...but I always tried to
protect Rachel from that.

1074
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:41,775
I did my very best
to protect her from...

1075
00:53:43,624 --> 00:53:45,424
...growing up too quickly,
you know?

1076
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,493
Right.

1077
00:53:48,495 --> 00:53:50,361
And now,
I'm learning that there are...

1078
00:53:52,631 --> 00:53:55,331
protect your kid from,
you know?

1079
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,107
No matter what you do,
you just...

1080
00:54:05,907 --> 00:54:09,409
So, did she have
any favorite toys?

1081
00:54:09,411 --> 00:54:11,411
Before I answer that question,
this is serious...

1082
00:54:13,046 --> 00:54:15,447
...so use your ears
and listen to me.

1083
00:54:16,782 --> 00:54:18,315
I want you
to promise me something

1084
00:54:18,317 --> 00:54:19,916
as I care about you.

1085
00:54:19,918 --> 00:54:21,584
You gotta promise me you're
not gonna have a baby...

1086
00:54:21,586 --> 00:54:22,785
...unless you're ready to love

1087
00:54:22,787 --> 00:54:23,986
that baby's mother
your whole life...

1088
00:54:23,988 --> 00:54:25,620
...and this is serious.

1089
00:54:25,622 --> 00:54:28,889
I'm telling you something
that nobody's gonna tell you.

1090
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:32,392
Don't pick a girl
who's push-pull, you know?

1091
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,874
You wanna pick somebody
who's gonna love you...

1092
00:54:35,629 --> 00:54:38,330
...and not forget you,
and not...

1093
00:54:38,332 --> 00:54:40,765
...leave you for someone
with a big, fat ass.

1094
00:54:41,633 --> 00:54:43,400
So, no favorite toy.

1095
00:54:43,968 --> 00:54:44,867
Um...

1096
00:54:44,869 --> 00:54:48,036
Oh, you want to know what?
Here's a favorite toy.

1097
00:54:48,038 --> 00:54:49,570
Scissors.

1098
00:54:49,572 --> 00:54:51,572
When Rachel's father
first left...

1099
00:54:51,574 --> 00:54:52,940
...she gathered up
all his books,

1100
00:54:52,942 --> 00:54:56,977
...and she rounded 'em up
and she cut them right up.

1101
00:54:56,979 --> 00:54:58,011
Please, don't tell her
I'm telling you,

1102
00:54:58,013 --> 00:54:59,712
she would chop my head off.

1103
00:54:59,714 --> 00:55:02,481
But she just...

1104
00:55:02,483 --> 00:55:04,516
And I was, like, "Atta girl."

1105
00:55:04,518 --> 00:55:07,852
Snip, snip, snip.
She was very mad.

1106
00:55:07,854 --> 00:55:10,354
Can we take a little break
and have a little taste?

1107
00:55:10,356 --> 00:55:11,855
You boys are old enough
to have a little taste, right?

1108
00:55:11,857 --> 00:55:13,977
Can we take a teeny break,
just have a little taste?

1109
00:55:15,725 --> 00:55:18,460
Oh, yeah, that's a good boy.

1110
00:55:18,462 --> 00:55:21,062
Greg, will you join us?

1111
00:55:21,064 --> 00:55:22,897
Oh, I'm okay.

1112
00:55:22,899 --> 00:55:25,399
Oh, come on,
don't be a party pooper!

1113
00:55:28,136 --> 00:55:30,403
Now we can get back
to our interview.

1114
00:55:31,638 --> 00:55:32,671
So, basically,
this whole setup

1115
00:55:32,673 --> 00:55:34,072
is so that, you know...

1116
00:55:34,074 --> 00:55:35,940
...I can talk to you,
you can talk to me...

1117
00:55:35,942 --> 00:55:38,542
...and I can see you,
and you can see me.

1118
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:39,776
Except it's not really me,
it's a phone.

1119
00:55:39,778 --> 00:55:41,477
And I know that
sounds kind of weird,

1120
00:55:41,479 --> 00:55:43,545
but it's not.

1121
00:55:43,547 --> 00:55:46,080
So, anyway, just treat it
like a get-well card,

1122
00:55:46,082 --> 00:55:47,614
you can look into the lens.

1123
00:55:47,616 --> 00:55:49,449
And, uh...

1124
00:55:49,451 --> 00:55:51,384
Yeah, it's a video,
so you know...

1125
00:55:51,386 --> 00:55:52,451
...don't think about it
too hard,

1126
00:55:52,453 --> 00:55:54,386
but just make it good.

1127
00:55:54,388 --> 00:55:55,754
Start whenever you're ready.

1128
00:55:55,756 --> 00:55:57,455
Hi, Rachel.

1129
00:55:57,457 --> 00:55:59,824
I guess I don't really
know you that well...

1130
00:55:59,826 --> 00:56:01,959
...but I believe in you.
You can do it.

1131
00:56:01,961 --> 00:56:03,927
That's real nice, yo.

1132
00:56:03,929 --> 00:56:05,762
It's so sweet
that your boyfriend

1133
00:56:05,764 --> 00:56:07,497
is doing this for you.

1134
00:56:07,499 --> 00:56:09,031
He must really love you.

1135
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:10,866
Girl, that ain't her boyfriend.

1136
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:12,667
Oh.

1137
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:14,702
<i>I know you're Jewish,
but I just wanted you to know</i>

1138
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,770
<i>that God has a plan for you.</i>

1139
00:56:16,772 --> 00:56:17,871
<i>You seem like
a really cool person.</i>

1140
00:56:17,873 --> 00:56:19,639
<i>I know we don't really talk.</i>

1141
00:56:19,641 --> 00:56:22,708
<i>But you've got
a lot of friends. And, uh...</i>

1142
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:23,608
<i>Out of all the people
in this school,</i>

1143
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:25,943
<i>I don't hate you.</i>

1144
00:56:25,945 --> 00:56:27,945
<i>I believe in you
and you can do it.</i>

1145
00:56:28,579 --> 00:56:30,079
<i>You can do it.</i>

1146
00:56:30,081 --> 00:56:31,613
<i>I believe in you.</i>

1147
00:56:32,147 --> 00:56:33,680
<i>You can do it.</i>

1148
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:34,881
Damn.

1149
00:57:00,169 --> 00:57:02,003
<i>So again,</i>

1150
00:57:02,005 --> 00:57:03,838
<i>if this was a touching,
romantic story...</i>

1151
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,006
<i>...we'd obviously fall in love</i>

1152
00:57:06,008 --> 00:57:07,741
<i>and she'd say all the wise,
beautiful things...</i>

1153
00:57:07,743 --> 00:57:10,877
<i>in life's twilight or whatever.</i>

1154
00:57:10,879 --> 00:57:12,745
<i>And then she'd die in my arms.</i>

1155
00:57:18,217 --> 00:57:20,818
<i>But again,
that's not what happened.</i>

1156
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:23,787
<i>She just got quieter.
And unhappier.</i>

1157
00:57:24,955 --> 00:57:26,522
So, how are you?

1158
00:57:27,657 --> 00:57:28,857
For real.

1159
00:57:30,459 --> 00:57:31,659
For real?

1160
00:57:33,561 --> 00:57:35,194
Feeling like
you might have been right.

1161
00:57:38,731 --> 00:57:39,971
Right when?

1162
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,799
Back in October.

1163
00:57:43,901 --> 00:57:46,002
When you thought I was dying.

1164
00:57:52,241 --> 00:57:54,608
Well, I mean,
I regret thinking that.

1165
00:57:56,811 --> 00:57:58,077
Don't regret it.

1166
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:20,596
What is that noise?

1167
00:58:20,598 --> 00:58:22,196
It's Regretful Polar Bear.

1168
00:58:25,667 --> 00:58:27,200
Polar Bears have
the purest expression

1169
00:58:27,202 --> 00:58:29,642
of regret in the animal kingdom.

1170
00:58:30,704 --> 00:58:33,338
Just listen to how haunting
and plaintive they sound.

1171
00:58:36,809 --> 00:58:39,742
Don't make me laugh.
Please. It kinda hurts.

1172
00:58:41,277 --> 00:58:42,517
All right.

1173
00:58:53,088 --> 00:58:55,528
Kind of a monster
silence in here.

1174
00:58:57,724 --> 00:58:58,724
Yeah.

1175
00:59:01,193 --> 00:59:03,327
It's okay to just be silent
for a while.

1176
00:59:06,197 --> 00:59:08,097
<i>Look,</i>

1177
00:59:08,099 --> 00:59:09,932
<i>I know you're really
bracing for this sweet girl...</i>

1178
00:59:09,934 --> 00:59:12,668
<i>...that you probably
like a lot to die.</i>

1179
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:15,971
<i>Just please bear with me.
She doesn't. She gets better.</i>

1180
00:59:15,973 --> 00:59:17,839
<i>I promise.</i>

1181
00:59:57,011 --> 00:59:59,278
<i>Pretty much all I remember
from that winter...</i>

1182
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,113
<i>...is working on
that stupid film...</i>

1183
01:00:01,115 --> 01:00:04,349
<i>that made some kind of sense...</i>

1184
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:06,017
<i>...and knowing the whole time
that I couldn't...</i>

1185
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:09,320
<i>to make the thing
we wanted to make...</i>

1186
01:00:09,322 --> 01:00:11,322
<i>...but it wasn't
possible for us.</i>

1187
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:14,991
<i>That was
an entire winter of my life.</i>

1188
01:00:19,362 --> 01:00:20,862
<i>I mean, obviously,</i>

1189
01:00:20,864 --> 01:00:22,624
<i>I remember visiting Rachel too.</i>

1190
01:00:24,699 --> 01:00:25,965
<i>Sometimes she talked,</i>

1191
01:00:25,967 --> 01:00:27,866
<i>and sometimes,
she didn't want to.</i>

1192
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:31,202
<i>When she didn't want to,
I talked.</i>

1193
01:00:31,204 --> 01:00:32,870
<i>Or we watched movies.</i>

1194
01:00:33,371 --> 01:00:34,491
<i>Sometimes, she laughed.</i>

1195
01:00:36,206 --> 01:00:37,439
<i>Sometimes, she didn't.</i>

1196
01:00:43,478 --> 01:00:46,046
<i>What I don't remember
is doing schoolwork.</i>

1197
01:00:48,883 --> 01:00:51,043
<i>I did literally zero
schoolwork during this time.</i>

1198
01:00:57,723 --> 01:00:58,723
<i>Not figuratively.</i>

1199
01:00:59,757 --> 01:01:02,058
<i>Literally zero schoolwork.</i>

1200
01:01:06,797 --> 01:01:08,717
<i>That's actually
sort of hard to do.</i>

1201
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:29,951
So, what's going on at school?

1202
01:01:32,921 --> 01:01:35,055
Well, right now,
the whole school looks like a castle...

1203
01:01:35,057 --> 01:01:37,057
...'cause everyone's
getting ready

1204
01:01:37,059 --> 01:01:38,299
for Medieval Prom.

1205
01:01:41,061 --> 01:01:43,862
I guess everyone's trying
to figure out how to, like...

1206
01:01:43,864 --> 01:01:45,104
...twerk medievally?

1207
01:01:46,898 --> 01:01:48,231
Are you going?

1208
01:01:48,233 --> 01:01:49,465
No, of course not.

1209
01:01:49,467 --> 01:01:51,166
You should go.

1210
01:01:51,168 --> 01:01:52,500
No way!

1211
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:55,335
Have you seen me in a tux?

1212
01:01:57,304 --> 01:01:59,538
It's like when they make
a dog wear human clothes.

1213
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:01,206
Have you seen that?

1214
01:02:01,208 --> 01:02:03,508
It just makes you
really sad to look at.

1215
01:02:06,545 --> 01:02:09,146
Oh, and I don't have
anyone to go with.

1216
01:02:09,148 --> 01:02:10,388
So there's that.

1217
01:02:15,485 --> 01:02:17,486
Unless...

1218
01:02:17,488 --> 01:02:19,221
...you know...
you wanted to...

1219
01:02:19,223 --> 01:02:21,189
Greg, I'm not going to prom.

1220
01:02:21,191 --> 01:02:23,224
I mean, you totally could.

1221
01:02:23,226 --> 01:02:24,992
It could be like a,
s-, awesome statement.

1222
01:02:25,326 --> 01:02:27,126
Hey, uh...

1223
01:02:27,128 --> 01:02:29,861
When are you guys
finishing your movie?

1224
01:02:33,265 --> 01:02:35,465
You don't know we're working
on a movie right now.

1225
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,433
You don't have to pretend.

1226
01:02:37,435 --> 01:02:40,034
Earl told me you guys
were making a movie for me.

1227
01:02:42,837 --> 01:02:44,003
God, yeah...

1228
01:02:45,405 --> 01:02:47,005
I guess he probably did.

1229
01:02:48,107 --> 01:02:49,273
I was just asking, because...

1230
01:02:49,275 --> 01:02:51,308
Goddamn it, Earl! Ugh.

1231
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:53,510
It was just, it was
supposed to be a surprise!

1232
01:02:54,411 --> 01:02:56,378
You know? It's taking forever

1233
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:57,912
because we really want
to get it right, and...

1234
01:02:57,914 --> 01:03:00,547
I'm probably gonna
stop treatment pretty soon.

1235
01:03:05,452 --> 01:03:06,692
What?

1236
01:03:10,956 --> 01:03:12,923
It just isn't
doing me any good.

1237
01:03:12,925 --> 01:03:14,891
All it's doing
is making me sicker.

1238
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:26,335
Yeah, but it...
I mean, if you stop, then...

1239
01:03:26,337 --> 01:03:28,236
Well, we'll just
see what happens.

1240
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:32,272
Well, we know
what's gonna happen, right?

1241
01:03:45,082 --> 01:03:46,948
I know who
you can take to prom.

1242
01:03:49,918 --> 01:03:51,038
Who?

1243
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:55,087
This sexy pillow here.

1244
01:03:55,089 --> 01:03:56,188
Oh, my God, can you just...

1245
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:58,089
Ooh, Greg,

1246
01:03:58,091 --> 01:03:59,223
this pillow's name is Francesca.

1247
01:03:59,225 --> 01:04:00,390
Don't joke,
I can't deal with that.

1248
01:04:00,392 --> 01:04:01,424
She's a filthy Italian woman.

1249
01:04:01,426 --> 01:04:02,666
Please, stop!

1250
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,094
Don't yell at me.

1251
01:04:06,096 --> 01:04:07,595
So, that's it?
Just, to hell with college,

1252
01:04:07,597 --> 01:04:08,529
to hell with growing up?

1253
01:04:08,531 --> 01:04:10,097
Greg, don't.

1254
01:04:10,099 --> 01:04:11,364
Rachel, what the hell
is wrong with you?

1255
01:04:11,366 --> 01:04:12,932
This is your life!

1256
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,067
Yeah, it is my life.

1257
01:04:17,169 --> 01:04:19,370
It's me who has to
lie in bed all day,

1258
01:04:19,372 --> 01:04:20,571
with a shaved head...

1259
01:04:20,573 --> 01:04:22,573
...getting weaker and uglier,

1260
01:04:22,575 --> 01:04:26,243
and more miserable,
with no hope in sight.

1261
01:04:26,245 --> 01:04:27,911
I'm the one who
has to suffer through this,

1262
01:04:27,913 --> 01:04:29,913
not you, so don't yell at me.

1263
01:04:32,549 --> 01:04:34,883
I'm sorry,
but I'm not gonna sit here

1264
01:04:34,885 --> 01:04:37,285
and get comfortable
watching you die.

1265
01:04:38,921 --> 01:04:41,081
Okay? I'm not.
I'm not gonna do that.

1266
01:04:41,356 --> 01:04:43,090
So don't ask me to.

1267
01:04:44,358 --> 01:04:46,225
If you can't accept
that I'm going to do

1268
01:04:46,227 --> 01:04:48,260
what I want to do
with my life...

1269
01:04:49,562 --> 01:04:51,195
...then you're
a terrible friend.

1270
01:04:53,031 --> 01:04:54,564
I'm a terrible friend?

1271
01:04:54,566 --> 01:04:55,531
Okay.

1272
01:04:55,533 --> 01:04:58,200
You know,
I'm not the one giving up.

1273
01:04:58,202 --> 01:04:59,501
I'm not ruining
my friend's life

1274
01:04:59,503 --> 01:05:01,202
by giving up
on the whole world.

1275
01:05:01,204 --> 01:05:03,170
Oh, please, Greg,
you should be overjoyed.

1276
01:05:03,172 --> 01:05:04,437
Now you can
go back to your life

1277
01:05:04,439 --> 01:05:06,672
of being invisible
and detached...

1278
01:05:06,674 --> 01:05:08,373
...and self-hating.

1279
01:05:11,076 --> 01:05:12,156
Yeah.

1280
01:05:13,611 --> 01:05:15,771
And you can go back
to your life of being dead.

1281
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:19,514
Nice. Really nice.

1282
01:05:25,687 --> 01:05:27,387
This is gonna kill your mom.

1283
01:05:31,458 --> 01:05:33,658
Have you gotten
comfortable with that?

1284
01:05:37,497 --> 01:05:39,631
That doesn't
bother you anymore?

1285
01:05:39,633 --> 01:05:40,665
Thinking about your mom?

1286
01:05:40,667 --> 01:05:42,033
Get outta here, Greg.

1287
01:05:42,035 --> 01:05:43,701
You've done your time.

1288
01:05:43,703 --> 01:05:46,023
You don't have to hang around
with the sick girl anymore.

1289
01:05:49,474 --> 01:05:51,914
How can you even
say that to me?

1290
01:05:52,576 --> 01:05:55,344
Your mom forced you
to hang out with me.

1291
01:05:55,346 --> 01:05:57,112
Earl forced you
to show me your movies.

1292
01:05:57,114 --> 01:05:59,280
Madison forced you
to make a movie about me.

1293
01:05:59,282 --> 01:06:01,382
So, what part of this
did you actually want to do?

1294
01:06:21,534 --> 01:06:23,835
Just... Just do something
nice for me for once

1295
01:06:23,837 --> 01:06:25,536
and just get out.

1296
01:06:51,328 --> 01:06:53,128
<i>Earl!</i>

1297
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:55,530
This is it!
You've gone too far!

1298
01:06:55,532 --> 01:06:56,731
You've leaked
the unleakable secret

1299
01:06:56,733 --> 01:06:58,399
because you hold nothing sacred.

1300
01:06:58,401 --> 01:06:59,466
'Cause you're a dickhead!

1301
01:06:59,468 --> 01:07:00,733
The foundation of any

1302
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:02,568
good working partnership
is trust...

1303
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:04,336
...and I can no longer
trust you in any way.

1304
01:07:04,338 --> 01:07:05,704
You'll leak anything to anyone.

1305
01:07:05,706 --> 01:07:07,272
It's like working
with Julian Assange.

1306
01:07:07,274 --> 01:07:09,207
Assangde. Ass-andge.
Damn it!

1307
01:07:22,721 --> 01:07:24,822
The hell you want?

1308
01:07:24,824 --> 01:07:26,864
Just waiting for Earl.
Awright, awright.

1309
01:07:27,525 --> 01:07:29,392
Whassup, boy?
You gonna come in?

1310
01:07:29,394 --> 01:07:31,627
So, Rachel told me that
you told her about the, uh...

1311
01:07:31,629 --> 01:07:33,749
...about the film
that we're making for her.

1312
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:36,797
You're like Julian Assange, man.

1313
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:38,431
It's like you always do this...

1314
01:07:38,433 --> 01:07:39,765
I don't know,
'cause you, like,

1315
01:07:39,767 --> 01:07:41,399
wanna be a better friend
than me or something?

1316
01:07:41,401 --> 01:07:42,533
I don't know if I can
work with you again

1317
01:07:42,535 --> 01:07:43,634
after you sell me out
like a dick!

1318
01:07:43,636 --> 01:07:45,702
Oh, okay. Watch out, yo.

1319
01:07:47,137 --> 01:07:49,371
Hey, yo,
shut your ass up, man!

1320
01:07:49,373 --> 01:07:50,672
Like you care so much about
what other people think,

1321
01:07:50,674 --> 01:07:51,806
boy, you go around here...

1322
01:07:51,808 --> 01:07:53,274
...kissin' everybody ass,

1323
01:07:53,276 --> 01:07:56,710
Look, nobody
gives a shit about you, Greg!

1324
01:07:56,712 --> 01:07:57,777
All right? Nobody give a shit!

1325
01:07:57,779 --> 01:07:59,478
Whoop his ass!

1326
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,646
And then the one girl
who do actually care about you...

1327
01:08:01,648 --> 01:08:02,847
...you wanna come
over here and

1328
01:08:02,849 --> 01:08:05,583
bitch and whine
about some films, yo? Huh?

1329
01:08:05,585 --> 01:08:07,885
Because somebody
actually cares about you?

1330
01:08:07,887 --> 01:08:09,453
Like, damn,
I'm so tired of you

1331
01:08:09,455 --> 01:08:11,288
treating this girl
like she a burden.

1332
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:13,189
You know,
her life is over after this!

1333
01:08:13,191 --> 01:08:14,557
And you want to come over here

1334
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:17,626
bitchin' and whinin' about
some irrelevant bullshit!

1335
01:08:17,628 --> 01:08:19,494
Like, yo, you so close to me
knocking your shit loose right now, son!

1336
01:08:19,496 --> 01:08:20,862
Go for it!

1337
01:08:20,864 --> 01:08:23,931
Yeah, I don't care!
You want me to hit you now?

1338
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,732
Yeah, Earl, I want you to!

1339
01:08:25,734 --> 01:08:28,134
That's right! Jack that
little dude up there!

1340
01:08:32,904 --> 01:08:34,537
See, Greg?

1341
01:08:34,539 --> 01:08:37,373
You lucky that was him
and not me out there...

1342
01:08:37,375 --> 01:08:39,408
...'cause I'd have been
whooping your ass up and down this street.

1343
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:41,770
It'd have been a ass-whoopin'
fest around here, you dig?

1344
01:08:50,451 --> 01:08:53,352
So what's the status
on the 20-pager on Nixon?

1345
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:58,255
Uh, I need another extension.

1346
01:08:58,257 --> 01:09:00,357
That might prove difficult...

1347
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:02,926
...seeing how it's the...

1348
01:09:02,928 --> 01:09:04,728
...the end of the quarter
and all.

1349
01:09:05,295 --> 01:09:07,862
Yeah, I've just been busy.

1350
01:09:09,965 --> 01:09:11,665
You know, I heard...

1351
01:09:15,369 --> 01:09:16,609
...about Rachel.

1352
01:09:17,771 --> 01:09:19,304
How you holding up?

1353
01:09:23,541 --> 01:09:24,781
You know...

1354
01:09:25,843 --> 01:09:27,310
...not great.

1355
01:09:32,983 --> 01:09:36,719
You know, my dad died
when I was 15, Greg.

1356
01:09:36,721 --> 01:09:39,421
A couple years
younger than you.

1357
01:09:39,423 --> 01:09:41,923
You know, the thing is that,
when I was a kid...

1358
01:09:42,958 --> 01:09:45,726
...I really,
I really can only remember

1359
01:09:45,728 --> 01:09:47,828
thinking about him as this...

1360
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:50,697
...you know, big,
kind of like asshole guy.

1361
01:09:52,599 --> 01:09:54,733
At his wake,
these buddies of his

1362
01:09:54,735 --> 01:09:56,000
kept coming up to me...

1363
01:09:56,002 --> 01:09:58,902
...and telling me
these stories about him.

1364
01:09:58,904 --> 01:10:00,904
And it was like
they were talking about

1365
01:10:00,906 --> 01:10:02,572
some complete other guy.

1366
01:10:04,308 --> 01:10:05,741
To give you an example.

1367
01:10:06,876 --> 01:10:09,811
He knew every single
European pop song

1368
01:10:09,813 --> 01:10:11,445
from the 1970s.

1369
01:10:13,581 --> 01:10:14,914
He'd memorize these songs,

1370
01:10:14,916 --> 01:10:16,982
and he'd do that
so he could go...

1371
01:10:16,984 --> 01:10:19,517
...and sing them
to German girls in bars.

1372
01:10:20,652 --> 01:10:22,319
He had a go-to,

1373
01:10:22,321 --> 01:10:24,454
his number one
go-to song. It was a...

1374
01:10:25,856 --> 01:10:29,591
It was a Dutch song.
It was called <i>Ding-a-Dong.</i>

1375
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:34,862
My dad used to sing that
to German girls in bars.

1376
01:10:36,331 --> 01:10:37,764
That's a fact.

1377
01:10:41,602 --> 01:10:43,269
So what does that mean?

1378
01:10:46,306 --> 01:10:48,666
Well, Greg, I think that
it just means that...

1379
01:10:50,008 --> 01:10:51,975
...even after somebody dies,
you can...

1380
01:10:53,477 --> 01:10:55,597
...you can still
keep learning about them.

1381
01:10:56,579 --> 01:10:58,947
You know, their life.

1382
01:11:01,450 --> 01:11:03,951
It can keep unfolding
itself to you just as long...

1383
01:11:05,553 --> 01:11:07,793
...just as long as
you pay attention to it.

1384
01:11:09,056 --> 01:11:10,489
Are you seriously
trying to turn this

1385
01:11:10,491 --> 01:11:12,657
into some stupid sappy lesson?

1386
01:11:15,026 --> 01:11:16,726
You're a good kid, Greg.

1387
01:11:16,728 --> 01:11:18,928
No! Look, I'm going home.

1388
01:11:20,931 --> 01:11:23,465
See, I'm cutting class
right in front of you. 'Kay?

1389
01:11:23,467 --> 01:11:25,800
I'm not a good kid. I'm not.

1390
01:11:42,984 --> 01:11:43,984
Okay.

1391
01:11:45,085 --> 01:11:47,352
Earl came by earlier
to drop something off...

1392
01:11:47,354 --> 01:11:49,454
...but he turned down
this superb

1393
01:11:49,456 --> 01:11:51,622
Andouille rabbit sausage...

1394
01:11:51,624 --> 01:11:53,357
...which is quite unlike him.

1395
01:11:54,592 --> 01:11:55,892
Is everything all right?

1396
01:11:57,494 --> 01:11:58,594
Buddy?

1397
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:18,912
<i>We tried
a lot of different ways</i>

1398
01:12:18,914 --> 01:12:20,947
<i>of making a film for you...</i>

1399
01:12:20,949 --> 01:12:23,683
<i>...but they were all
too goofy or irrelevant...</i>

1400
01:12:23,685 --> 01:12:25,651
<i>...or just not what we wanted.</i>

1401
01:12:25,653 --> 01:12:27,719
<i>So, now I'm gonna
talk to you directly.</i>

1402
01:12:28,587 --> 01:12:30,387
<i>Um...</i>

1403
01:12:30,389 --> 01:12:32,789
<i>All right, I'm gonna be
honest here. Okay?</i>

1404
01:12:32,791 --> 01:12:35,124
<i>Sometimes, white girls
are particularly stupid.</i>

1405
01:12:35,126 --> 01:12:39,595
<i>I mean, everybody's stupid,
but white girls, you know...</i>

1406
01:12:39,597 --> 01:12:41,363
<i>They think
they better than everybody</i>

1407
01:12:41,365 --> 01:12:43,365
<i>and self-centered
and pretend they not.</i>

1408
01:12:43,367 --> 01:12:45,700
<i>But...</i>

1409
01:12:45,702 --> 01:12:47,622
<i>you aren't like that,
you know. Um...</i>

1410
01:12:48,436 --> 01:12:50,537
<i>It's just crazy
how patient you've been.</i>

1411
01:12:50,539 --> 01:12:52,739
<i>You know, I know if it was me
that had cancer, uh...</i>

1412
01:12:53,873 --> 01:12:56,574
<i>...I'd be upset and angry</i>

1413
01:12:56,576 --> 01:12:59,610
<i>and trying to beat
everybody's ass half the time.</i>

1414
01:12:59,612 --> 01:13:02,713
<i>So I'm just, I'm just amazed
at how patient you've been.</i>

1415
01:13:05,383 --> 01:13:07,150
<i>You, you make me feel blessed.</i>

1416
01:13:17,528 --> 01:13:20,862
<i>By Michael Powell
and Emeric Pressburger.</i>

1417
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:23,964
<i>I think, ultimately,
what one has to understand</i>

1418
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:25,699
<i>watching this film...</i>

1419
01:13:25,701 --> 01:13:28,034
<i>...it's a very special
piece of filmmaking.</i>

1420
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:29,969
Oh.

1421
01:13:29,971 --> 01:13:31,603
Are you eating lunch
in here still?

1422
01:13:32,772 --> 01:13:35,039
Not if you are.

1423
01:13:35,041 --> 01:13:37,081
Well, I'm not eating
lunch in here if you are.

1424
01:13:37,809 --> 01:13:40,677
Good,
'cause I like it in here.

1425
01:13:40,679 --> 01:13:42,612
So I guess I could just go.

1426
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:44,680
Or you could go.

1427
01:13:45,648 --> 01:13:48,249
No, I like
the air-conditioner.

1428
01:13:48,251 --> 01:13:50,251
And I like
the comfortable chair.

1429
01:13:53,955 --> 01:13:56,022
Yeah, I like those too.

1430
01:13:57,157 --> 01:13:59,258
Sounds like your damn problem.

1431
01:14:01,728 --> 01:14:04,029
<i>Which showed
one film per week...</i>

1432
01:14:04,031 --> 01:14:06,197
<i>...twice a night,
and three times on Saturday.</i>

1433
01:14:07,265 --> 01:14:09,132
<i>In a way,</i>
Tales of Hoffmann <i>is...</i>

1434
01:14:09,134 --> 01:14:13,536
<i>...the culmination of
Powell-Pressburger's work...</i>

1435
01:14:13,538 --> 01:14:15,738
<i>...with what they call
the composed film.</i>

1436
01:14:37,025 --> 01:14:38,892
Hey!

1437
01:14:38,894 --> 01:14:40,214
Can I talk to you
about the movie?

1438
01:14:40,627 --> 01:14:41,893
Um...

1439
01:14:41,895 --> 01:14:43,861
Yeah, it's not done yet.

1440
01:14:43,863 --> 01:14:44,928
Greg, you guys
have been working on it

1441
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:46,095
for like four months.

1442
01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:49,731
Yeah, well...

1443
01:14:49,733 --> 01:14:50,665
I don't know,
we tried a bunch of stuff

1444
01:14:50,667 --> 01:14:52,233
and it just...

1445
01:14:52,934 --> 01:14:54,167
...didn't really work.

1446
01:14:54,169 --> 01:14:55,067
It's not that good.

1447
01:14:55,069 --> 01:14:56,768
Greg!

1448
01:14:56,770 --> 01:14:59,203
Now is not the time for your
"I'm Greg, I suck,

1449
01:14:59,205 --> 01:15:00,871
"nothing I do
is any good" thing.

1450
01:15:00,873 --> 01:15:02,172
I'm sure what you have
is awesome

1451
01:15:02,174 --> 01:15:04,207
and I think she would
really benefit...

1452
01:15:04,209 --> 01:15:06,249
...if you just got it done
and gave it to her.

1453
01:15:07,276 --> 01:15:08,975
Madison,
she stopped treatment.

1454
01:15:12,179 --> 01:15:13,379
She gave up.

1455
01:15:15,348 --> 01:15:16,848
She quit.

1456
01:15:19,251 --> 01:15:20,784
Well, I guess
that's a really good reason

1457
01:15:20,786 --> 01:15:22,051
to just finish
the fucking movie.

1458
01:15:22,053 --> 01:15:23,252
And give it to her.

1459
01:15:25,655 --> 01:15:26,821
But whatever.

1460
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:41,068
Honey?

1461
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:43,903
What?

1462
01:15:49,942 --> 01:15:51,842
Rachel's back
in the hospital, honey.

1463
01:15:56,314 --> 01:15:58,595
Wait, is she starting
treatment again?

1464
01:16:00,917 --> 01:16:02,784
It's not for treatment, honey.

1465
01:16:07,889 --> 01:16:08,889
Oh.

1466
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:13,993
Mom, what?

1467
01:16:15,128 --> 01:16:16,695
Well, I thought
we could go and...

1468
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:19,397
To force me
to hang out with her?

1469
01:16:19,399 --> 01:16:20,898
Greg, come on.

1470
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,099
Don't worry, Mom,
I'm sure you can find

1471
01:16:22,101 --> 01:16:24,261
another girl with cancer
after Rachel dies.

1472
01:16:25,636 --> 01:16:27,169
Which, by the way...

1473
01:16:27,837 --> 01:16:29,304
...she's decided to do.

1474
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,341
She's just decided to die...

1475
01:16:34,343 --> 01:16:37,010
...so maybe I can decide
not to visit her.

1476
01:16:42,682 --> 01:16:45,650
I promise you,
you will regret that...

1477
01:16:45,652 --> 01:16:46,732
...if you don't visit her.

1478
01:16:48,054 --> 01:16:49,853
You'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

1479
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:51,654
Mom, that's probably true.

1480
01:16:51,656 --> 01:16:52,888
But honestly,
I have a shitload of things

1481
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:54,890
to regret right now.

1482
01:16:54,892 --> 01:16:57,158
I regret not having a date
for tomorrow's stupid prom.

1483
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:59,894
I regret being too weird
to make friends.

1484
01:16:59,896 --> 01:17:01,061
I definitely regret making

1485
01:17:01,063 --> 01:17:02,729
all those shitty films
with Earl.

1486
01:17:02,731 --> 01:17:04,931
And I assume you saw the email
I got today, from Pitt?

1487
01:17:06,132 --> 01:17:07,832
Oh, no? You didn't see it

1488
01:17:07,834 --> 01:17:08,999
while you're going though
all my shit? Here.

1489
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:11,234
Have a look.

1490
01:17:11,236 --> 01:17:12,735
I'm definitely gonna regret

1491
01:17:12,737 --> 01:17:14,417
doing literally
no school work this year!

1492
01:17:14,704 --> 01:17:16,004
Oh, my God, Greg.

1493
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:18,039
I know. Admission rescinded,

1494
01:17:18,041 --> 01:17:20,141
due to significant change
in my academic record.

1495
01:17:20,143 --> 01:17:22,009
Oh, well,
no college next year.

1496
01:17:22,011 --> 01:17:23,944
I guess I'll just be home,
which sucks for you...

1497
01:17:23,946 --> 01:17:24,911
...because it's gonna be
so hard for you

1498
01:17:24,913 --> 01:17:26,712
to go through all my stuff.

1499
01:17:26,714 --> 01:17:28,180
Can you just do me a favor
right now, Mom?

1500
01:17:28,182 --> 01:17:29,848
Just leave me alone. Okay?

1501
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:31,449
Just let me sit here
and regret stuff.

1502
01:17:31,451 --> 01:17:32,817
I'm just gonna think about

1503
01:17:32,819 --> 01:17:33,918
all the things
that I've ever done...

1504
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,352
...and all the things
I haven't done

1505
01:17:35,354 --> 01:17:37,794
and just regret the living shit out of it.
Okay?

1506
01:17:42,893 --> 01:17:45,060
All the deadlines
have passed, Victor.

1507
01:17:45,062 --> 01:17:46,327
What's he gonna do next year?

1508
01:17:46,329 --> 01:17:47,795
He's just gonna
waste the year?

1509
01:17:47,797 --> 01:17:49,096
He is grieving, honey.

1510
01:17:49,098 --> 01:17:50,397
You have to let him grieve.

1511
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:51,398
But I can't just sit by

1512
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,133
and just let him
ruin his life.

1513
01:17:53,135 --> 01:17:56,336
The universe does not operate

1514
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:58,058
according to a college deadline!

1515
01:18:17,223 --> 01:18:18,323
Can I ask you something?

1516
01:18:19,825 --> 01:18:21,192
Nope.

1517
01:18:21,194 --> 01:18:22,826
No. It's not what you think.

1518
01:18:22,828 --> 01:18:24,060
It's just that
prom is tonight and...

1519
01:18:24,062 --> 01:18:26,195
Let me ask you something.
What is this?

1520
01:18:27,163 --> 01:18:29,063
What is up
with the arm touching?

1521
01:18:29,065 --> 01:18:30,264
Are you just being friendly,

1522
01:18:30,266 --> 01:18:31,732
or is this some
calculated maneuver...

1523
01:18:31,734 --> 01:18:33,133
...to get me to do
whatever you want?

1524
01:18:33,135 --> 01:18:34,367
'Cause you have to understand

1525
01:18:34,369 --> 01:18:36,135
what it does
when a beautiful, sexy...

1526
01:18:36,137 --> 01:18:37,336
...otherwise
thoughtful girl...

1527
01:18:37,338 --> 01:18:39,237
...touches the arm
of a scrawny, pasty

1528
01:18:39,239 --> 01:18:40,404
groundhog-faced kid.

1529
01:18:40,406 --> 01:18:41,505
It's an act of cruelty.

1530
01:18:42,507 --> 01:18:44,007
Are you done?

1531
01:18:44,009 --> 01:18:45,208
Yeah. Yeah, I'm done.

1532
01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:46,943
I'm done with you.

1533
01:18:46,945 --> 01:18:49,145
I'm done
with this stupid film.

1534
01:18:49,147 --> 01:18:50,513
All right? I'm done.

1535
01:18:52,115 --> 01:18:53,815
Yo! But you ain't
done with me!

1536
01:18:53,817 --> 01:18:55,149
I'm back for my revenge

1537
01:18:55,151 --> 01:18:56,416
Stab you in the dick

1538
01:18:56,418 --> 01:18:58,151
Pardon my French

1539
01:18:58,153 --> 01:19:00,486
Really? You're gonna stab me
in the dick? Go ahead.

1540
01:19:00,488 --> 01:19:01,854
Stab me in the dick.

1541
01:19:01,856 --> 01:19:04,523
Just no rapping.
Okay? All right?

1542
01:19:04,525 --> 01:19:06,057
I'll break your eyeball

1543
01:19:06,059 --> 01:19:07,224
with a fist I got clenched

1544
01:19:07,226 --> 01:19:09,025
Shove your body
under another bench

1545
01:19:09,027 --> 01:19:10,826
Stop rapping!

1546
01:19:10,828 --> 01:19:12,828
Knock your teeth out
with the fist I got clenched

1547
01:19:12,830 --> 01:19:15,070
I can't do this if you're
gonna rap the whole time.

1548
01:19:31,944 --> 01:19:33,077
Aw!

1549
01:19:35,914 --> 01:19:37,014
Break it up!

1550
01:19:37,016 --> 01:19:38,348
Earl!

1551
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:40,950
Break it up! Break it up!

1552
01:19:40,952 --> 01:19:41,951
I thought you were
eating lunch

1553
01:19:41,953 --> 01:19:43,118
in Mr. McCarthy's office.

1554
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,352
Man, I was,
but he all sad talking

1555
01:19:44,354 --> 01:19:45,486
about German music and shit.

1556
01:19:45,488 --> 01:19:47,788
That's boring as hell, man.

1557
01:19:47,790 --> 01:19:50,323
I'm surprised and disappointed
to see you two fighting.

1558
01:19:50,325 --> 01:19:52,058
And, Phillip,
I'm surprised and disappointed

1559
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:53,359
to see you
back on school grounds...

1560
01:19:53,361 --> 01:19:54,993
...after being expelled!

1561
01:19:54,995 --> 01:19:56,260
All right, man.

1562
01:19:56,262 --> 01:19:57,094
Please leave the premises.

1563
01:19:57,096 --> 01:19:58,428
Back to class.

1564
01:19:58,430 --> 01:19:59,962
Let's go!

1565
01:19:59,964 --> 01:20:02,097
Maxwell, Ryan, Soledad,

1566
01:20:02,099 --> 01:20:04,365
stop gawking and start walking!

1567
01:20:09,236 --> 01:20:11,003
Greg!

1568
01:20:11,005 --> 01:20:13,338
Yo, babe!
You see me pummel this bitch?

1569
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:14,572
Come on and keep walking

1570
01:20:14,574 --> 01:20:16,274
'fore I can whoop
that ass again, man.

1571
01:20:16,276 --> 01:20:17,608
Madison, what?

1572
01:20:18,676 --> 01:20:20,143
Come to prom with me.

1573
01:20:22,579 --> 01:20:24,212
I know the whole
movie situation

1574
01:20:24,214 --> 01:20:26,013
was really difficult for you...

1575
01:20:26,015 --> 01:20:28,095
...and I kind of feel like
it was my fault.

1576
01:20:28,649 --> 01:20:30,049
So I just kind of wanted to

1577
01:20:30,051 --> 01:20:32,371
make it up to you
a little bit.

1578
01:20:33,619 --> 01:20:35,419
Is this a pity date?

1579
01:20:35,421 --> 01:20:36,686
No.

1580
01:20:36,688 --> 01:20:38,220
No, it's not a pity date.

1581
01:20:40,189 --> 01:20:41,389
Greg, just come
to prom with me.

1582
01:20:41,391 --> 01:20:42,631
I think we'd have a good time.

1583
01:20:45,627 --> 01:20:47,527
Told you you would get a date.

1584
01:20:48,395 --> 01:20:49,395
Yep.

1585
01:20:55,234 --> 01:20:58,069
So you're welcome.
For the tux and everything.

1586
01:20:59,337 --> 01:21:00,503
Thanks, Mom.

1587
01:21:15,952 --> 01:21:18,553
I'm very upset
about this college thing.

1588
01:21:20,422 --> 01:21:22,055
But your father and I can wait

1589
01:21:22,057 --> 01:21:24,537
till you're ready
to talk about it.

1590
01:21:25,959 --> 01:21:27,225
I appreciate that.

1591
01:21:30,262 --> 01:21:32,062
Don't forget your corsage.

1592
01:21:35,166 --> 01:21:36,166
All right.

1593
01:21:42,005 --> 01:21:44,339
My handsome boy...

1594
01:21:44,341 --> 01:21:45,973
...going to prom.

1595
01:21:48,710 --> 01:21:50,711
Take lots of pictures, okay?

1596
01:22:09,596 --> 01:22:10,661
302 Halket Street.

1597
01:22:11,195 --> 01:22:12,628
What's that?

1598
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:14,162
I said 302 Halket Street.

1599
01:22:14,630 --> 01:22:16,263
Huh?

1600
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:17,664
302 Halket Street.

1601
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:19,532
Halket? Okay.
Okay.

1602
01:22:19,534 --> 01:22:21,200
You got it, baby.

1603
01:22:21,202 --> 01:22:22,668
So you love this girl?

1604
01:22:24,404 --> 01:22:26,304
Uh, no.
I wouldn't go that far.

1605
01:22:26,571 --> 01:22:28,004
What?

1606
01:22:28,006 --> 01:22:30,039
No. I... No.

1607
01:22:30,041 --> 01:22:31,106
Yeah, so you guys
are gonna be getting busy

1608
01:22:31,108 --> 01:22:33,041
on my brand new Tuscan leather?

1609
01:22:33,043 --> 01:22:35,076
No. I think...
Huh?

1610
01:22:35,078 --> 01:22:36,677
No, we're not.
I don't think so.

1611
01:22:36,679 --> 01:22:38,612
Nah, I'm just
playing with you.

1612
01:22:38,614 --> 01:22:40,614
But I do hope you get some.

1613
01:22:40,616 --> 01:22:42,549
It's really gonna depend
on what she wants to do.

1614
01:22:42,551 --> 01:22:43,550
If you really love her,
though,

1615
01:22:43,552 --> 01:22:45,118
you definitely got a shot.

1616
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,486
Because she'll know.

1617
01:22:47,454 --> 01:22:49,054
She is fine though?

1618
01:22:50,589 --> 01:22:51,589
Huh?

1619
01:23:54,417 --> 01:23:55,517
Hey.

1620
01:23:59,455 --> 01:24:00,721
I know, I look amazing.

1621
01:24:05,659 --> 01:24:07,393
Can I put some flowers on you?

1622
01:24:22,541 --> 01:24:24,141
Like that.

1623
01:24:32,116 --> 01:24:33,276
Okay.

1624
01:24:34,217 --> 01:24:36,885
Before we watch this...

1625
01:24:36,887 --> 01:24:39,187
...I'm sorry
it took so long to make.

1626
01:24:39,189 --> 01:24:41,689
But the reason is...

1627
01:24:41,691 --> 01:24:44,458
...just couldn't figure out
how to get it to not suck.

1628
01:24:45,827 --> 01:24:48,895
But... we never really
did figure it out.

1629
01:24:48,897 --> 01:24:50,329
It still sucks.

1630
01:24:55,167 --> 01:24:57,201
It's not exactly
what I wanted to say to you.

1631
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:04,807
But...

1632
01:25:06,309 --> 01:25:08,176
...whatever.

1633
01:25:08,178 --> 01:25:10,138
Let's just
watch this first, okay?

1634
01:28:23,602 --> 01:28:25,069
Hey, should I get a nurse?

1635
01:28:27,072 --> 01:28:29,073
Denise! Denise!

1636
01:29:41,579 --> 01:29:43,580
<i>That was the last time
I saw Rachel.</i>

1637
01:29:44,882 --> 01:29:47,116
<i>She went into a coma
shortly after that,</i>

1638
01:29:47,118 --> 01:29:48,584
<i>and died about 10 hours later.</i>

1639
01:29:51,854 --> 01:29:53,814
<i>I know I told you
she doesn't die.</i>

1640
01:29:54,489 --> 01:29:55,755
<i>And I'm sorry.</i>

1641
01:29:56,490 --> 01:29:58,190
<i>Deep down...</i>

1642
01:29:58,192 --> 01:30:00,759
<i>...somehow,
I didn't think she would.</i>

1643
01:30:02,528 --> 01:30:03,794
<i>But she did.</i>

1644
01:33:30,363 --> 01:33:32,297
<i>Dear Greg,
I heard what happened</i>

1645
01:33:32,299 --> 01:33:33,765
<i>with your class work.</i>

1646
01:33:33,767 --> 01:33:35,099
<i>And with Pitt State.</i>

1647
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,967
<i>So, I wrote them a letter,</i>

1648
01:33:37,969 --> 01:33:40,049
<i>trying to convince them
to let you back in.</i>

1649
01:33:40,903 --> 01:33:44,038
<i>There's a copy in here,
if you want to read it.</i>

1650
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:45,839
<i>Hopefully, it works,
because that would mean...</i>

1651
01:33:45,841 --> 01:33:48,775
<i>...I have powers
from beyond the grave.</i>

1652
01:33:48,777 --> 01:33:51,058
<i>But you should probably
send them something too.</i>

1653
01:33:52,679 --> 01:33:55,981
<i>Goodbye, Greg.
You're a good friend.</i>

1654
01:33:55,983 --> 01:33:57,082
<i>Although if you don't
go to college,</i>

1655
01:33:57,084 --> 01:33:58,716
<i>you're also an idiot.</i>

1656
01:33:58,718 --> 01:34:00,250
<i>But you already knew that.</i>

1657
01:34:01,252 --> 01:34:02,385
<i>Love, Rachel.</i>

1658
01:34:04,888 --> 01:34:08,257
<i>I'd also like for you
to take some of my pillows.</i>

1659
01:34:08,259 --> 01:34:10,959
<i>They'll want a good home
where they'll be loved.</i>

1660
01:34:10,961 --> 01:34:12,927
<i>Not in the way you're thinking,</i>

1661
01:34:12,929 --> 01:34:13,969
<i>that's disgusting.</i>

1662
01:37:49,207 --> 01:37:51,441
<i>Dear Pittsburgh
State Admissions:</i>

1663
01:37:51,443 --> 01:37:53,142
<i>I'm writing
on behalf of someone</i>

1664
01:37:53,144 --> 01:37:54,910
<i>who gave me
half a year of his life...</i>

1665
01:37:54,912 --> 01:37:56,177
<i>...at the time when I was at</i>

1666
01:37:56,179 --> 01:37:58,412
<i>my most difficult to be around.</i>

1667
01:37:58,414 --> 01:38:00,547
<i>He has a very
low opinion of himself,</i>

1668
01:38:00,549 --> 01:38:01,614
<i>which is why
I think it's necessary...</i>

1669
01:38:01,616 --> 01:38:03,082
<i>...that you hear from someone</i>

1670
01:38:03,084 --> 01:38:05,184
<i>who sees him
as he actually is:</i>

1671
01:38:05,186 --> 01:38:07,452
<i>A limitlessly kind,
sweet, giving,</i>

1672
01:38:07,454 --> 01:38:09,487
<i>and genuine person.</i>

1673
01:38:09,489 --> 01:38:11,529
<i>No matter how much
he would deny it.</i>

1674
01:38:12,356 --> 01:38:14,590
<i>The drop in his academic
performance this year...</i>

1675
01:38:14,592 --> 01:38:15,591
<i>...is the consequence
of all the time</i>

1676
01:38:15,593 --> 01:38:19,494
<i>...and the time he spent
making things for me...</i>

1677
01:38:19,496 --> 01:38:21,629
<i>...and how hard
that was for him.</i>

1678
01:38:21,631 --> 01:38:23,597
<i>You can ask him about it...</i>

1679
01:38:23,599 --> 01:38:25,632
<i>...but his sort of
over-the-top humility</i>

1680
01:38:25,634 --> 01:38:27,200
<i>will probably get in the way.</i>

1681
01:38:27,202 --> 01:38:31,537
<i>No one has done more
to make me smile than he has.</i>

1682
01:38:31,539 --> 01:38:33,105
<i>And no one ever could.</i>

1683
01:38:51,290 --> 01:38:52,523
<i>Rachel's ashes were scattered</i>

1684
01:38:52,525 --> 01:38:54,291
<i>in a park behind her house.</i>

1685
01:38:55,427 --> 01:38:57,161
<i>Apparently, she ran away
from home once</i>

1686
01:38:57,163 --> 01:38:58,595
<i>and tried to live there.</i>

1687
01:39:00,464 --> 01:39:03,432
<i>It was this story
her aunt told at the funeral.</i>

1688
01:39:03,434 --> 01:39:05,367
<i>She was trying
to become a squirrel.</i>

1689
01:39:06,469 --> 01:39:07,635
<i>She thought she could
turn into one</i>

1690
01:39:07,637 --> 01:39:09,236
<i>just by being in the forest...</i>

1691
01:39:09,238 --> 01:39:12,372
<i>...and wanting it really bad.</i>

1692
01:39:12,374 --> 01:39:15,475
<i>I guess maybe that's
what Mr. McCarthy meant...</i>

1693
01:39:15,477 --> 01:39:18,077
<i>...about someone's life
continuing to unfold.</i>

1694
01:39:19,512 --> 01:39:21,112
<i>It was weird to be
learning something new</i>

1695
01:39:21,114 --> 01:39:22,646
<i>about Rachel after she died.</i>

1696
01:39:24,248 --> 01:39:26,515
<i>But somehow,
it was reassuring as well.</i>
