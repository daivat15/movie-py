1
00:02:16,048 --> 00:02:19,443
Fuck Wolverine.

2
00:02:19,487 --> 00:02:22,185
First, he rides my coattails
with the R rating.

3
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:26,624
Then the hairy motherfucker
ups the ante by dying.

4
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:28,844
What a dick.

5
00:02:28,887 --> 00:02:31,107
Well, guess what, Wolvie?

6
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,979
I'm dying in this one, too.

7
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:39,115
To understand
why I took a cat-nap

8
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,248
on 1,200 gallons
of high-test fuel...

9
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,640
I need to take you back

10
00:02:42,684 --> 00:02:45,121
to the dewy slopes
of six weeks ago.

11
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,514
I'd gone international,

12
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:48,472
taking out mass murderers,
gangsters,

13
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:50,213
unspeakable monsters.

14
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:53,216
People nobody would touch.
Except me.

15
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,218
I'm gonna touch them all over.

16
00:02:58,874 --> 00:03:00,789
Hey, it's Gail calling.

17
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:01,964
Love the shiny suit.

18
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:03,748
Really brings out

19
00:03:03,792 --> 00:03:05,872
the sex trafficker
in your eyes.

20
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:11,016
I don't
speak Cantonese, Mister...

21
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,193
Well, I'm not even gonna
attempt that.

22
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:15,717
But I did take 8th grade Spanish, so...

23
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:20,896
Which literally
translates to...

24
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:23,986
I don't bargain,
pumpkin fucker.

25
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:36,477
Oh. Oh, this isn't Gilbert's.

26
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,782
I am so sorry.

27
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:39,506
I thought this was
an anal-bleaching party.

28
00:04:02,024 --> 00:04:03,895
Don't worry.
You're not going to die.

29
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:06,028
Although these will kill you.

30
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:07,290
Hit it, Dolly.

31
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:28,964
I'm merely
a vessel for the Lord.

32
00:04:40,236 --> 00:04:42,804
Taking the hands out
of the guns of the criminals!

33
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,857
Whoo! Do not go in there!

34
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,649
Let's see
Captain America do that.

35
00:05:10,614 --> 00:05:12,137
Too exotic?

36
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:37,266
Oh, God! Oh, God,
time out! Time out!

37
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:40,835
Cut. I've got bad guy blood,
right in my open eye.

38
00:06:40,878 --> 00:06:42,880
Oh, that's so gross.

39
00:06:44,012 --> 00:06:46,188
Fuck.

40
00:06:46,231 --> 00:06:48,122
Looks like you left
a little landing strip there.

41
00:06:48,146 --> 00:06:49,191
I like it.

42
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:55,937
Oh, man!

43
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:02,247
My world tour
brought me home

44
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,728
to this guy,
Sergei Valishnikov.

45
00:07:04,772 --> 00:07:06,295
But we'll get to him
in a moment.

46
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:07,775
'Cause I know
what you're thinking.

47
00:07:07,818 --> 00:07:10,560
"I'm so glad
I left the kiddos at home."

48
00:07:10,604 --> 00:07:12,301
But that's where
you'd be wrong.

49
00:07:12,344 --> 00:07:15,086
That babysitter of yours
is high as fuck right now...

50
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,439
and, believe it or not,
Deadpool 2 is a family film.

51
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:21,266
True story.

52
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,487
And every good family film
starts with a vicious murder.

53
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:27,621
Bambi, The Lion King, Saw 7.

54
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:30,972
Holy shit pickles!
That guy's on fire.

55
00:07:31,015 --> 00:07:33,931
That's not CGI, folks.
He's actually on fire.

56
00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:37,369
Yeah. You know I get paid
to take out bad guys, right?

57
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:38,632
But this guy?

58
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:40,634
He was
one of the worst of 'em.

59
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:44,855
Hurry up and open
this fucking door,

60
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:46,179
and let's kill
this motherfucker!

61
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:55,170
Ugh. So gross.

62
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:58,042
A panic room? Really?

63
00:07:58,086 --> 00:08:00,305
Can you come out?

64
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:03,439
I really have to go.
It's my anniversary.

65
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:10,770
Over and over,
I hear people say,

66
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:12,361
"I just don't have
enough confidence."

67
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:14,494
Listen, confidence is not
something you have.

68
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:15,973
It's something you create.

69
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:17,932
And you can create it
at any moment in time.

70
00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:19,673
A sense of confidence
is nothing

71
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:21,457
but a sense of power
within yourself...

72
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,043
a sense of certainty that
you can pull something off.

73
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:25,156
Start the fucking car!

74
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,331
Dopinder!

75
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,898
Start the fucking car!

76
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:35,079
Shoot that motherfucker!
Shoot him!

77
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:36,646
Whoo! Oh, I shit my pants.

78
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,083
Actually, that may
have been me.

79
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:40,389
Oh, mission accomplished?

80
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:42,565
Oh, in a George W.
sort of way.

81
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:44,306
Fucker can't stay
in a panic room forever.

82
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:45,805
Oh, you're living
the dreams, DP.

83
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:48,005
It has been
quite the run, Dopinder,

84
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:49,354
and who'da thought?

85
00:08:49,398 --> 00:08:51,835
Now I'm talked about
in the same sentence as Jesus.

86
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,750
Passion of the Christ, then me.

87
00:08:53,794 --> 00:08:55,056
At least domestically.

88
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:56,318
We beat them overseas,

89
00:08:56,361 --> 00:08:58,363
where there's no such thing
as religion.

90
00:08:58,407 --> 00:09:00,583
I do want to live
the dreams, Pool Boy.

91
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:03,020
Taxiing is not as sexy
as it looks.

92
00:09:03,064 --> 00:09:04,848
I want to fill my... Pockets?

93
00:09:04,892 --> 00:09:08,112
What's your poison?
A little, uh, cokey cokey?

94
00:09:08,156 --> 00:09:09,505
Can't maintain an erection

95
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,091
without buying shoes online?

96
00:09:11,115 --> 00:09:13,074
I've never experienced
that last one.

97
00:09:13,117 --> 00:09:14,510
Talk to me, Goose.

98
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,252
I was going to say "soul".
I want to fill my soul.

99
00:09:17,295 --> 00:09:20,385
I want to belong to something,
like you, Pool, sir.

100
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:22,387
Dopinder... Hmm?

101
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,259
You never cease
to surprise me.

102
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,393
You know, the depth of
your heart is extraordinary.

103
00:09:28,437 --> 00:09:30,091
We all need
a sense of belonging.

104
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:31,919
We all need
a genuine sense of home.

105
00:09:31,962 --> 00:09:33,094
A place in this world.

106
00:09:33,137 --> 00:09:34,497
I want to become
a contract killer.

107
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,358
I'm sorry. What did you say?

108
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:38,360
Remember when
I kidnapped Bandhu

109
00:09:38,403 --> 00:09:39,729
and threatened him
with great violence?

110
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:41,363
You kind of killed him.

111
00:09:41,406 --> 00:09:42,993
And then remember the movie
Interview with the Vampire?

112
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:44,192
Don't want to.

113
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:45,323
When Tom Cruise fed

114
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:47,195
10-year-old
Kirsten Dunst blood

115
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:48,457
for the first time...

116
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,894
and she looked up
at his smooth,

117
00:09:50,938 --> 00:09:53,157
handsome face and said...

118
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:55,725
"I want some more."

119
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:59,424
Oh, Pool, picture me,
a 10-year-old Kirsten Dunst.

120
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:03,167
I'll never not picture that.

121
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:04,995
But I can't wait
to never speak of this,

122
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,084
as soon as possible.

123
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:09,609
We're here.

124
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:18,400
Dopinder, it's me again.

125
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:20,141
Look, a saner man
might discourage you

126
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:22,056
from joining
the deadly merc business...

127
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:23,579
what, with your concave chest

128
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,276
and your
paper towel tube arms.

129
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,017
But you're an eagle...

130
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:29,063
and goddamn it,
an eagle's gotta soar.

131
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:30,499
You gotta grab those dreams,

132
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:32,153
grab those dreams
by the dick tip...

133
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:33,720
and make it rain!

134
00:10:33,763 --> 00:10:35,678
I don't know what that means.

135
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:37,680
Me neither.

136
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:39,769
I'm gonna see you...

137
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:42,424
at the office.

138
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,121
In the sky.

139
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:45,296
You're my Tom Cruise!

140
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,950
And you're my Kristen Dunst!

141
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:48,473
Kristen? Kirsten?

142
00:10:53,522 --> 00:10:55,132
Sorry I'm late.

143
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:56,743
There was a bunch of

144
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:58,875
handicapable children
stuck in a tree...

145
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,442
and I had to, uh... Uh-uh.

146
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:03,227
You're right.
I was fighting a caped badass.

147
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:05,621
But then we discovered
his mom is named Martha, too.

148
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,971
No.You got me.

149
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:09,799
I was rounding up
all the gluten in the world

150
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:11,061
and launching it into space...

151
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:13,237
where it can't not
hurt us ever again.

152
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:14,456
Try again.

153
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:16,588
Diarrhea?

154
00:11:16,632 --> 00:11:18,392
We can't be sure
until I get this suit off...

155
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,289
but, uh,
all signs point to yes.

156
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:24,205
Traffic?

157
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:25,859
Hmm?

158
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:28,731
Kiss me
like you miss me, Red.

159
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:29,775
Well, come here.

160
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:43,920
I'm gonna shower
and get out of this suit.

161
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:45,139
Don't you want
your surprise?

162
00:11:45,182 --> 00:11:47,010
Do I look like
a patient burn victim?

163
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:49,056
I got one for you, too.

164
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:51,711
Happy anniversary, baby.

165
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:53,321
Open, open, open.

166
00:11:55,323 --> 00:11:57,064
Skee-Ball token.

167
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:58,500
Our first date.

168
00:11:58,543 --> 00:12:00,110
Yup.

169
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:02,809
That's genuine,
high-grade lead.

170
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,031
I'll keep it forever.

171
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:09,511
Thank you, baby.

172
00:12:11,121 --> 00:12:12,819
Open yours. All right, all right.

173
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,038
Oh...

174
00:12:16,431 --> 00:12:18,322
That's just the most
beautiful thing that I've...

175
00:12:18,346 --> 00:12:19,739
I don't know
what this is.

176
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,610
My IUD.

177
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:22,829
A bomb?

178
00:12:22,872 --> 00:12:25,962
No, dick for brains.
My birth control device.

179
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:27,094
What, you mean that your...

180
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:28,878
Baby factory's open
for business.

181
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:30,227
Oh, my God!

182
00:12:30,271 --> 00:12:33,535
Oh, my God! I want a boy!

183
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:36,668
Or a little girl!
Definitely one or the other!

184
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:39,497
Oh! And I want our kid
to have only one name.

185
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:43,327
Like Cher or Todd.

186
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:45,155
You gotta pump a baby
in me first, cowboy.

187
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:46,548
Yes, I do.

188
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:48,091
Let's watch some porn
and show that bed who's boss.

189
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:49,116
Let's do that.

190
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:52,467
♪ Papa... ♪

191
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,686
♪ Can you hear me? ♪

192
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:58,778
♪ Papa, can you see me? ♪

193
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:01,041
Does this song
sound familiar to you?

194
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:05,523
May.

195
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:09,266
Connor, if it's a boy.
May, if it's a girl.

196
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:14,358
So weird.

197
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:16,796
Family was always
an F-word to me.

198
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:22,671
My pile of shit father
took off and bailed.

199
00:13:22,714 --> 00:13:24,934
I mean, it's not like I have
a lot of strong role models

200
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:26,718
to draw off of for Todd.

201
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:30,505
Hey. Look at me.

202
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,813
You are not your father.

203
00:13:35,553 --> 00:13:36,990
Besides...

204
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:41,777
I will never, ever
let our child be named Todd.

205
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:43,823
But here's the thing,

206
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,694
isn't that how
it always works?

207
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:47,261
Like in Star Wars,

208
00:13:47,304 --> 00:13:50,003
men are destined
to become their father...

209
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:53,136
and then have consensual sex
with their sister?

210
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,487
I think you missed
big, big chunks of that movie.

211
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:58,794
No, I'm pretty sure
Luke nailed her.

212
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,883
Baby, that's Empire.

213
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:03,538
The point is, kids...

214
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:07,672
they give us a chance
to be better than we are.

215
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:11,154
Better than we used to be.

216
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:13,722
You're a lot smarter
than I look.

217
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:16,420
I'm gonna go make dessert.

218
00:14:16,464 --> 00:14:20,903
You get the strap-on.
Let's make a super baby.

219
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:24,341
Pretty sure it doesn't work
that way, but we can try.

220
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:27,910
What about Krystal?
But with a "K"?

221
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:29,912
It's too stripper-y.

222
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:31,479
Kevin with a "K"!

223
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:33,611
No, too stripper-y, too.

224
00:14:34,177 --> 00:14:36,092
Uh, Earl!

225
00:14:36,136 --> 00:14:38,486
He's gonna go straight to jail

226
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:40,749
if we name him Earl.

227
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:42,664
What about Bruce?

228
00:14:43,665 --> 00:14:45,101
No.

229
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:46,189
Get down.

230
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:47,625
What?

231
00:15:16,524 --> 00:15:18,613
Baby? Baby?

232
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:23,574
I'm okay.

233
00:15:23,618 --> 00:15:26,273
Thank God I didn't have to use
the cream cheese spreader.

234
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:02,135
Please.

235
00:16:07,227 --> 00:16:09,055
Please. Please.

236
00:16:09,098 --> 00:16:12,275
Baby, I'm so sorry.

237
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:16,105
No!

238
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:23,336
♪ Papa, can you hear me? ♪

239
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:26,077
Is it just me, or does

240
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:27,707
Do You Want to Build
a Snowman? from Frozen...

241
00:19:27,731 --> 00:19:29,037
sound suspiciously like

242
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,039
Papa, Can You Hear Me?
from Yentl?

243
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:34,521
♪ Papa, can you hear me? ♪

244
00:19:36,305 --> 00:19:38,916
And nobody
fucking realizes it.

245
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,527
Wade, you gotta go home.

246
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:43,312
You've been sitting here
for three days, okay?

247
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:47,055
You smell like sauerkraut
left in the warm rain.

248
00:19:47,098 --> 00:19:49,405
Like wet garbage
in hot urine.

249
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:51,625
You smell like
a dog ate kitty litter...

250
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:53,714
and then farted his way
out of the living room.

251
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:55,585
I mean, like Rush Limbaugh's

252
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:57,457
couch cushions
after Shark Week.

253
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,241
I love Frozen.

254
00:19:59,285 --> 00:20:02,853
I loved her. I loved her
like an ocean loves water.

255
00:20:02,897 --> 00:20:04,420
An ocean is water.

256
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:09,208
More importantly, I liked her.
I really liked her, you know?

257
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:10,383
George Michael was right.

258
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:12,254
I'm never gonna
dance again. Fuck!

259
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:13,864
He's dead, too.

260
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,389
At least we still have Bowie.

261
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:18,173
Oh, Mr. Pool.
David Bowie is...

262
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,479
Uh, uh, uh...

263
00:20:19,522 --> 00:20:20,697
still with us.

264
00:20:20,741 --> 00:20:23,613
We do.
We'll always have Bowie.

265
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,267
I'm sorry.

266
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:26,747
Shot after shot,

267
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,638
it's not gonna change the fact
that I think you're...

268
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:30,292
Are you pissing?
Are you urinating right now?

269
00:20:30,316 --> 00:20:33,232
You're making the face that
you make when you urinate.

270
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:34,842
Is he pissing? I'm on it!

271
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:36,365
There you go, Dopinder.

272
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:38,454
If you want to be
a contract killer...

273
00:20:38,498 --> 00:20:41,065
you gotta handle a mop
before you handle a gun.

274
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:42,173
Although I don't
quite understand

275
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:43,764
how they are at all similar.

276
00:20:43,807 --> 00:20:45,916
'Cause I could shove either
one up your ass and kill you.

277
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,071
Now, leave me.

278
00:20:47,115 --> 00:20:48,116
I get it.

279
00:20:48,638 --> 00:20:50,249
Go home, Wade.

280
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,642
I don't have a home,
Weas, you know. I got a...

281
00:20:54,078 --> 00:20:55,471
Okay, I'm fine.

282
00:20:55,515 --> 00:20:56,646
I'm fine.

283
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,518
You know what "fine"
stands for, Wade?

284
00:20:58,561 --> 00:21:02,304
Fucked up, insecure,
needy, and emotional.

285
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:03,566
According to the...

286
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:06,352
Kubler-Ross.Yeah.

287
00:21:06,395 --> 00:21:08,267
According to
the Kubler-Ross model...

288
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:11,095
denial is just one of
the five stages of grief.

289
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:13,489
Jesus Christ, Buck!

290
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:15,448
No more speaking lines
for you.

291
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:26,459
Hey, bud. Bud.

292
00:21:26,502 --> 00:21:28,591
- Huh?
- Got a match?

293
00:21:28,635 --> 00:21:30,158
Match?

294
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:31,681
Yes, I have one right here.

295
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:33,093
Don't make a move.
This is a stick-up.

296
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:34,858
- What?
- You heard me.

297
00:21:34,902 --> 00:21:36,947
Mister, Mister,
put down that gun.

298
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:39,602
Shut up. Now, come on.
Your money or your life?

299
00:21:47,784 --> 00:21:51,527
Look, bud. I said,
"Your money or your life."

300
00:21:51,571 --> 00:21:52,876
"I'm thinking it over!"

301
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,313
Motherfuck!

302
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:55,401
Fuck!

303
00:21:58,404 --> 00:21:59,883
The hell you doin' here?

304
00:21:59,927 --> 00:22:02,016
Don't you know how to knock?

305
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:03,974
I thought you saw me...

306
00:22:04,018 --> 00:22:05,541
with your ears.

307
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:06,649
You're lucky I didn't
shoot you in the...

308
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:07,717
The wall?

309
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:11,155
The refrigerator?
I'm in so much pain.

310
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:15,551
I heard the news,
sweetie.

311
00:22:15,595 --> 00:22:17,684
I'm very sorry. I am.

312
00:22:17,727 --> 00:22:19,642
What am I gonna do, Al?

313
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:21,383
Probably something terrible.

314
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:23,951
Knowing you.

315
00:22:23,994 --> 00:22:25,518
It was my fault.

316
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:29,435
I fucking did this.

317
00:22:29,478 --> 00:22:31,350
And all I wanna do
is grab her and see her

318
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:33,352
and tell her that I'm sorry,
and I can't.

319
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,007
She's gone.

320
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:40,837
Sweetheart,
can you speak up?

321
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:42,143
It's a little hard
to hear you

322
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:43,884
with that pity dick
in your mouth.

323
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:46,974
Now, look, sugar.
You need to just keep living.

324
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:48,323
Thank you...

325
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,370
Matthew McConaughey,
your words are a treasure.

326
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,459
Listen to the pain.

327
00:22:53,502 --> 00:22:56,287
It's both history teacher
and fortune teller.

328
00:22:56,331 --> 00:22:59,943
Pain teaches us
who we are, Wade.

329
00:22:59,987 --> 00:23:03,860
Sometimes, it's so bad,
we feel like we're dying.

330
00:23:03,904 --> 00:23:06,602
But we can't really live till
we've died a little, can we?

331
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:10,345
Wade?

332
00:23:12,782 --> 00:23:14,958
Wade? I'm right here, Althea.

333
00:23:15,002 --> 00:23:17,613
And that is
the most beautiful thing

334
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:18,875
I've ever heard.

335
00:23:19,615 --> 00:23:21,182
And you're absolutely right.

336
00:23:25,055 --> 00:23:27,406
I'm about to do
something terrible.

337
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:34,717
Precious, aren't they?

338
00:23:35,544 --> 00:23:36,980
Whoa!

339
00:23:37,024 --> 00:23:38,460
Are you a superhero?

340
00:23:38,504 --> 00:23:40,201
Fucking A, sweetie.

341
00:23:40,244 --> 00:23:41,811
What's your name?

342
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:43,639
Captain Delicious Pants.

343
00:23:43,683 --> 00:23:45,859
Who's Captain Delicious Pants?

344
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:13,234
I can't believe
he's still alive.

345
00:24:13,277 --> 00:24:15,758
I can't believe you left
the house in that shirt.

346
00:24:17,238 --> 00:24:19,196
There's gotta be
some way to die.

347
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,285
I just need to die harder.

348
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:22,548
Trademark Fox.

349
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:23,592
Y'all caught up now?

350
00:24:36,866 --> 00:24:38,520
Open for business.

351
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:44,526
Your crazy
matches my crazy.

352
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,722
I will never, ever
let our child be named Todd.

353
00:24:46,746 --> 00:24:48,008
Skee-Ball token.

354
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:49,331
You're a lot smarter
than I look.

355
00:24:55,232 --> 00:24:56,514
About why
we're so good together.

356
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:57,733
I love you,
Wade Wilson.

357
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:01,761
Ness?

358
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,372
Ness?

359
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,766
Ness.

360
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:09,508
Ness, there's something here.
I can't get to you.

361
00:25:11,205 --> 00:25:13,729
Your heart's not
in the right place.

362
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:16,427
Wait, hold on. What?

363
00:25:16,471 --> 00:25:18,560
Your heart's not
in the right place.

364
00:25:18,604 --> 00:25:19,996
Wait. What do you mean

365
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,000
my heart's not in the right
place? What does it...

366
00:25:41,235 --> 00:25:43,759
I'm terribly sorry
for your loss, Wade.

367
00:25:44,238 --> 00:25:45,369
You're broken.

368
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:48,372
Oh, God.
I know that voice.

369
00:26:09,437 --> 00:26:10,873
Well, Russell.

370
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:13,572
I hear you're handy
at picking locks.

371
00:26:14,964 --> 00:26:17,184
There will be no need
for that here.

372
00:26:17,227 --> 00:26:20,535
There's no locks on our doors,
no bars on our windows.

373
00:26:21,884 --> 00:26:23,930
I know what you're thinking.

374
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:26,628
Why don't the kids just run?

375
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:29,631
Who would choose to stay
in such a place?

376
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:32,155
You stay because...

377
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:36,943
deep down inside, you know
you're unfit to leave.

378
00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:42,339
Don't worry.

379
00:26:43,514 --> 00:26:45,168
We can fix that.

380
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:53,742
Blessed are the wicked
who are healed by my hand.

381
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:17,418
"Heart's in the right place."

382
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:18,917
"Heart's in the right..."
What does that mean?

383
00:27:18,941 --> 00:27:20,856
Take your mask off, Wade.

384
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,597
I wish you'd said "pants".

385
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,859
Let's play a game.

386
00:27:23,903 --> 00:27:26,427
It's called
"Adrien Brody or Adam Brody?".

387
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,821
Now, close your eyes
and open your mouth.

388
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:30,692
You don't need
to be funny here.

389
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:32,563
We must talk.

390
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:35,088
You need fresh start.

391
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:36,698
Such a glare.

392
00:27:36,742 --> 00:27:39,005
It's like I'm on stage
at the Gaiety.

393
00:27:39,048 --> 00:27:41,660
With training,
you can be X-Man.

394
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:43,792
You're wasting your time,
Shiny Jesus.

395
00:27:43,836 --> 00:27:45,141
I'm not X-Man material.

396
00:27:45,185 --> 00:27:46,752
Understatement of the year.

397
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,231
Wade, Yukio.

398
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,625
Yukio, Wade.

399
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,758
What in the fuck knuckles
is this?

400
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:55,456
She's my girlfriend,
you intolerant shit.

401
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:57,327
Whoa! Pump the hate brakes,
Fox & Friends.

402
00:27:57,371 --> 00:27:59,242
I'm just surprised
anyone would date you.

403
00:27:59,286 --> 00:28:01,897
Especially Pinkie Pie
from My Little Pony.

404
00:28:01,941 --> 00:28:03,769
I like this guy.

405
00:28:03,812 --> 00:28:05,901
Give him a chance.

406
00:28:05,945 --> 00:28:07,052
It's great seeing you
like this.

407
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:09,252
Yeah.

408
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:11,037
Bye, Wade!

409
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,561
Now, some ground rules
while under our roof.

410
00:28:13,604 --> 00:28:16,390
"Rule number one.
No killing...

411
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:19,872
"anyone ever,
no matter how bad.

412
00:28:19,915 --> 00:28:22,570
"Rule two. Label everything
in refrigerator."

413
00:28:22,613 --> 00:28:23,614
Wade?

414
00:28:24,485 --> 00:28:25,747
Wade?

415
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:27,618
Don't try to chase me. Wade!

416
00:28:27,662 --> 00:28:29,751
I'm not ready
to be touched again.

417
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:32,014
All these old guys
on the wall.

418
00:28:32,058 --> 00:28:34,147
Who lives here,
Calista Flockhart?

419
00:28:36,453 --> 00:28:39,369
Those were already damaged
after they fell there!

420
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:41,284
What am I supposed
to do around here, anyway?

421
00:28:41,328 --> 00:28:43,591
Sit in a share circle,
talk about my feelings?

422
00:28:43,634 --> 00:28:46,507
And how would I
do that exactly?

423
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,988
'Cause where the fuck
is everyone?

424
00:28:49,031 --> 00:28:50,250
It's always just you

425
00:28:50,293 --> 00:28:51,618
and Negasonic Teenage
Longest Name Ever...

426
00:28:51,642 --> 00:28:52,861
Enough!

427
00:28:52,905 --> 00:28:54,733
I said no touching!

428
00:28:56,517 --> 00:28:59,781
What the fuck?

429
00:28:59,825 --> 00:29:02,001
You'd think the studio
would throw us a bone.

430
00:29:02,044 --> 00:29:04,873
One that doesn't end up
in my mouth.

431
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:06,111
The first movie
made more money

432
00:29:06,135 --> 00:29:08,485
than the guy
who invented pants.

433
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:10,705
They can't just dust off
one of the famous X-Men?

434
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,838
How 'bout that putz
with the giant pigeon wings?

435
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:14,187
What do those do anyway, huh?

436
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,710
Carry him
three feet off the ground

437
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,799
to snatch up
the nearest muffin crumb?

438
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:20,019
No, no, no!

439
00:29:20,062 --> 00:29:22,804
I am not X-Man material
at all.

440
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:25,502
First off...

441
00:29:25,546 --> 00:29:27,591
I'm not even a virgin.
Second and more...

442
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:30,856
I should have left you

443
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:32,640
in the self-pitying mess
I found you in.

444
00:29:32,683 --> 00:29:35,774
But this is what friends do.
They show up!

445
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:37,819
Not when convenient or easy.

446
00:29:37,863 --> 00:29:42,171
When hard,
and you always make it hard.

447
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:44,695
You are unwell.

448
00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:46,828
I'm sticking my neck out
bringing you here.

449
00:29:46,872 --> 00:29:48,787
Wait.
One of the assholes

450
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,310
who killed Vanessa got away.

451
00:29:52,878 --> 00:29:55,054
Oh, Jesus Christ!

452
00:29:55,097 --> 00:29:56,988
I thought you were gonna
kiss me for a second there.

453
00:29:57,012 --> 00:29:58,947
Please know I wouldn't be
able to stop you if you did.

454
00:29:58,971 --> 00:30:01,016
Wade, whoever they are...

455
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,410
we track them down
and bring them to justice.

456
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:05,412
It was me.

457
00:30:08,241 --> 00:30:10,896
I'm the asshole who got away.

458
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:14,073
I killed every last one
of them, except me.

459
00:30:14,116 --> 00:30:15,814
Couldn't kill me.

460
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:20,949
We were gonna start a family.

461
00:30:22,777 --> 00:30:24,735
We were, uh...

462
00:30:25,954 --> 00:30:27,695
We were gonna be a family.

463
00:30:28,478 --> 00:30:29,610
Wade...

464
00:30:29,653 --> 00:30:32,439
Vanessa is gone.
She's not coming back.

465
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:36,356
This may not be
family you want...

466
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,837
but it's family you need.

467
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,142
You have a good heart.

468
00:30:40,186 --> 00:30:41,752
It belongs here
where it can grow.

469
00:30:43,537 --> 00:30:44,538
What did you say?

470
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:47,889
About my heart?

471
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:55,331
I think
I'm in the right place.

472
00:32:03,138 --> 00:32:05,967
I'mma tell you
what the big lie is.

473
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:07,621
Toilet paper.

474
00:32:07,664 --> 00:32:09,057
What's so bad
about toilet paper?

475
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:10,319
Gets the job done.

476
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:13,235
Does it really
get the job done?

477
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,498
All right. Say you wake up
tomorrow morning...

478
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:20,242
and, hypothetically, find some
fresh shit on your face.

479
00:32:20,286 --> 00:32:22,003
Your cheek, maybe
a little bit in the beard.

480
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:23,743
What the hell?
I'm about to be fucking sick!

481
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:24,855
What do you do?

482
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:26,205
Do you go to a bathroom

483
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:27,946
and tear off
a piece of dry tissue...

484
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:29,860
and rub it around
on your beard a little bit

485
00:32:29,904 --> 00:32:31,471
and then go on,
get on with your day?

486
00:32:31,514 --> 00:32:33,125
Go to church,
maybe dinner and a movie,

487
00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:34,300
like nothing happened?

488
00:32:34,343 --> 00:32:35,736
Where is this
coming from, man?

489
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:36,998
But something did happen.

490
00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:38,521
Your face smells like shit.
Right?

491
00:32:38,565 --> 00:32:40,132
So what you would do,

492
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:42,438
is you would get some soap,
you'd get some hot water...

493
00:32:42,482 --> 00:32:44,832
and you would scrub
the fucking shit

494
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:46,877
out of your beard
for 10 straight minutes.

495
00:32:46,921 --> 00:32:48,618
You could not
scrub it enough.

496
00:32:48,662 --> 00:32:50,316
Are you trying
to make me feel disgusting?

497
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:51,578
I'm starting to feel...

498
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:54,320
Toilet paper is
a pretty fine appetizer.

499
00:32:54,363 --> 00:32:56,670
But, then...

500
00:32:56,713 --> 00:32:59,020
Huggies Natural Care
wet wipes.

501
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:00,456
That's your main course.

502
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,417
They're soft, they're moist.
They're for babies.

503
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,246
Finally, one more pass
with toilet paper,

504
00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:09,204
maybe clear out
that excess moisture.

505
00:33:09,248 --> 00:33:10,901
Maybe treat yourself
to a blow and go,

506
00:33:10,945 --> 00:33:12,251
if you can get you
a hair dryer.

507
00:33:12,294 --> 00:33:14,644
Just about 30 seconds
would do you good.

508
00:33:18,344 --> 00:33:19,345
The fuck?

509
00:33:20,607 --> 00:33:21,651
Year.

510
00:33:22,652 --> 00:33:23,653
What?

511
00:33:24,872 --> 00:33:26,526
What year is it?

512
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:29,007
What kind of dumbass question
is that to ask?

513
00:33:59,776 --> 00:34:02,562
We have 8 weeks of
boot camp ahead of us, men.

514
00:34:02,605 --> 00:34:03,954
That'll get us
toned and prepared

515
00:34:03,998 --> 00:34:05,565
for all manner of combat.

516
00:34:07,654 --> 00:34:11,875
Not working out at all.

517
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:13,573
Masking tape.

518
00:34:13,616 --> 00:34:15,966
It is no friend
to chilled aluminum.

519
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,057
Velcro.
Color-coded, efficient,

520
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,145
environmentally friendly.

521
00:34:20,928 --> 00:34:22,495
Who is he talking to?

522
00:34:22,538 --> 00:34:24,212
And why is he dressed like
a registered sex offender?

523
00:34:24,236 --> 00:34:26,238
Can we focus
for a moment, ladies?

524
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:28,588
Please, we need to talk about
next month's meal plan.

525
00:34:28,631 --> 00:34:30,416
Obviously,
everyone hated the ceviche.

526
00:34:30,459 --> 00:34:31,808
I read the suggestion box.

527
00:34:31,852 --> 00:34:33,462
I'm gonna stop you
right there.

528
00:34:33,506 --> 00:34:35,508
I see through this weak act.

529
00:34:35,551 --> 00:34:39,903
You may have fooled Colossus
with this nice guy shit...

530
00:34:39,947 --> 00:34:41,122
but not me.

531
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:42,254
Don't be mean.

532
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:43,646
Back off, NTW.

533
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,909
No, no, no. Let her go.

534
00:34:45,953 --> 00:34:47,128
Let her go, it's okay.

535
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:48,738
She has a right
to be skeptical.

536
00:34:48,782 --> 00:34:51,393
Look at me.
I'm an easy target.

537
00:34:52,568 --> 00:34:53,961
You know, historically,

538
00:34:54,004 --> 00:34:55,919
mischief has been
my mistress...

539
00:34:55,963 --> 00:34:58,618
so I understand, you know.
But I like to think...

540
00:35:00,228 --> 00:35:03,536
that you guys have
really rubbed off on me.

541
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:05,659
I like to think that I've
rubbed off around you, too.

542
00:35:07,627 --> 00:35:09,585
A lot.

543
00:35:09,629 --> 00:35:12,284
And for the first time
in a long while...

544
00:35:12,327 --> 00:35:13,502
I like me.

545
00:35:15,722 --> 00:35:18,246
I accept your apology. I never apologized.

546
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,856
I was talking to your heart.

547
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,294
See? You're not
lost cause you thought.

548
00:35:22,337 --> 00:35:25,558
I'm proud. You're everything
I knew you can be.

549
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:27,603
Thank you, Colossus.

550
00:35:27,647 --> 00:35:29,257
Just trying to be
the world's best X-Man.

551
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:30,737
Sorry, X-Person.

552
00:35:32,304 --> 00:35:35,002
Hmm. Something wrong
with the soap.

553
00:35:35,045 --> 00:35:36,656
It's fine.

554
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:38,919
I just filled it. Give it
a few more pumps there.

555
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,618
Now, if you'll excuse me...

556
00:35:42,662 --> 00:35:44,446
it's dust bunny season...

557
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,491
and I'm hunting wabbits.

558
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:47,319
Bye, Wade!

559
00:35:49,495 --> 00:35:52,062
Fuck.
Fuck you.

560
00:36:03,726 --> 00:36:06,294
No one is born perfect.

561
00:36:06,338 --> 00:36:08,340
But you can be.

562
00:36:08,383 --> 00:36:10,733
I know you're doing
what comes naturally.

563
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:16,870
You can't help yourself.

564
00:36:20,743 --> 00:36:22,832
But you can.

565
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:25,966
It takes work, discipline...

566
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:27,228
and treatment.

567
00:36:27,272 --> 00:36:28,969
Your abilities...

568
00:36:30,927 --> 00:36:33,713
I know how seductive they are.

569
00:36:33,756 --> 00:36:36,890
How powerful
they make you feel.

570
00:36:36,933 --> 00:36:39,458
But you must learn
never to use them...

571
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:42,112
so they will never use you.

572
00:36:48,336 --> 00:36:49,946
Please don't cry.

573
00:36:50,773 --> 00:36:52,384
I'm going to help.

574
00:36:52,427 --> 00:36:55,604
I'm gonna make you feel
what you should feel.

575
00:36:55,648 --> 00:36:58,172
How you need to feel...

576
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,567
every time you're tempted
to act upon your urges.

577
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:05,527
Suck my mutant dick,
you four-eyed fuck.

578
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:21,151
Wade.

579
00:37:22,152 --> 00:37:23,719
Wade!

580
00:37:23,763 --> 00:37:25,852
Come in!
Hey, I was just doing

581
00:37:25,895 --> 00:37:27,810
a little bit
of light reading here...

582
00:37:27,854 --> 00:37:29,290
We have mission.

583
00:37:29,334 --> 00:37:30,857
Well, you guys be
safe out there.

584
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,162
I'll be praying for you.

585
00:37:32,206 --> 00:37:34,600
No, I want you to join.

586
00:37:35,818 --> 00:37:36,993
I'm sorry, what?

587
00:37:37,037 --> 00:37:38,647
You heard me.

588
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:41,084
Trust me,
that's a terrible idea.

589
00:37:41,128 --> 00:37:42,216
I'm really not ready.

590
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,957
You are ready. I'm not.

591
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,872
Be at the X-Jet in five.

592
00:37:45,915 --> 00:37:47,090
I can do thirty.

593
00:37:47,134 --> 00:37:49,092
Now. I can do now.

594
00:37:49,136 --> 00:37:50,355
Final offer.

595
00:37:50,398 --> 00:37:52,966
Irene Merryweather, WHIT News.

596
00:37:53,009 --> 00:37:55,011
Live here
at a breaking news situation

597
00:37:55,055 --> 00:37:57,710
at the Essex House
for Mutant Rehabilitation.

598
00:37:57,753 --> 00:37:59,712
A mutant boy
is appearing to have

599
00:37:59,755 --> 00:38:01,235
some sort of an incident...

600
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,778
- with police here behind me.
- Get away from me!

601
00:38:02,802 --> 00:38:05,239
There are two police vehicles
that are overturned.

602
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,738
There are open fires. Fuck off! Stay back!

603
00:38:06,762 --> 00:38:07,826
A scene of
absolute chaos here.

604
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:08,982
Calm down.

605
00:38:09,025 --> 00:38:11,637
I'll burn you!
You stay back!

606
00:38:12,377 --> 00:38:14,161
Get away from me!

607
00:38:14,204 --> 00:38:16,685
You wanna fucking die?

608
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,921
And it appears as if the X-Men
are arriving...

609
00:38:34,964 --> 00:38:36,488
Scatter!

610
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:38,533
...with what appears
to be a trainee.

611
00:38:38,577 --> 00:38:41,580
Everyone, calm down!
The pros are here. I...

612
00:38:41,623 --> 00:38:42,798
We're the X-Men!

613
00:38:42,842 --> 00:38:45,366
A dated metaphor for racism
in the '60s.

614
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:47,934
So, respect.

615
00:38:47,977 --> 00:38:49,239
At ease, Officer.

616
00:38:50,806 --> 00:38:52,330
What are you doing?

617
00:38:52,808 --> 00:38:54,114
My job!

618
00:38:54,157 --> 00:38:55,557
You're the one who said
I was ready,

619
00:38:55,594 --> 00:38:57,117
and I frankly disagreed
with you.

620
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,554
But here we are, trying to
overcome our differences.

621
00:38:59,598 --> 00:39:02,035
Like Beyonce says, "Please...

622
00:39:02,862 --> 00:39:04,254
"Please, stop cheating on me."

623
00:39:04,298 --> 00:39:05,386
Hey!

624
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,822
This is the fifth incident.

625
00:39:06,866 --> 00:39:09,085
This kid needs to be
in the Ice Box, not here.

626
00:39:09,129 --> 00:39:10,783
Russell belongs in our care.

627
00:39:10,826 --> 00:39:12,611
Not in prison.
I assure you...

628
00:39:12,654 --> 00:39:13,805
we have everything
under control.

629
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:14,937
Stay back!
I'll burn you!

630
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:16,179
Not getting a real

631
00:39:16,223 --> 00:39:18,312
"under control"
vibe here, Marty.

632
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,401
It is Glen, isn't it? Daniel.

633
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:21,663
I'll ask the questions,
Miguel.

634
00:39:21,707 --> 00:39:23,056
Let me talk to the kid.

635
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:27,930
You stay here with your weird,
secret sex lips.

636
00:39:29,671 --> 00:39:30,716
You wanna die?

637
00:39:30,759 --> 00:39:31,954
This kid's adorable.

638
00:39:31,978 --> 00:39:32,998
I don't know why I packed
the hollow points.

639
00:39:33,022 --> 00:39:34,197
I'll burn your balls off!

640
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:37,592
First day.
I'm so nervous!

641
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:39,202
Did you just say
"hollow points"?

642
00:39:39,246 --> 00:39:40,595
Yeah, probably should've

643
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:42,684
brought a Super Soaker.

644
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,251
Hi, there!

645
00:39:45,513 --> 00:39:48,037
Stay back
or Justin Bieber dies!

646
00:39:48,081 --> 00:39:51,563
Justin Bieber.
He called you Justin Bieber.

647
00:39:52,955 --> 00:39:54,629
Hold on! Wait, wait, wait!

648
00:39:54,653 --> 00:39:57,786
Okay, let's not do
whatever that is.

649
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,353
Okay? Let's just talk!

650
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,007
It's Russell, right?

651
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:03,313
Firefist.Firefist.

652
00:40:03,357 --> 00:40:05,577
Ooh, that's a great name.
Where does it burn?

653
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,420
Just the fist, or all the way
up to the elbow?

654
00:40:12,105 --> 00:40:14,760
Definitely all
the way up to the elbow.

655
00:40:14,803 --> 00:40:17,632
Come quietly,
or there will be trouble.

656
00:40:17,676 --> 00:40:20,461
You stole that from Robocop!
That's from Robocop!

657
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:22,158
Just stand down!

658
00:40:22,202 --> 00:40:24,291
You're embarrassing me.
Look, Fire...

659
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,164
Oh, my God! I can't say it!
I'm so sorry!

660
00:40:32,691 --> 00:40:36,695
Oh, shit!
That fucking does it!

661
00:40:36,738 --> 00:40:38,131
Put your hands
behind your knees

662
00:40:38,174 --> 00:40:39,654
and get down
on your head! Now!

663
00:40:39,698 --> 00:40:41,961
Wade! What was first rule?

664
00:40:42,004 --> 00:40:43,963
Label everything
in the refrigerator!

665
00:40:44,006 --> 00:40:46,618
Do not escalate!
Rules are meant to be broken!

666
00:40:46,661 --> 00:40:48,097
That's the exact opposite

667
00:40:48,141 --> 00:40:49,490
of what they're meant for!

668
00:40:50,535 --> 00:40:52,493
Fuck! Fine!

669
00:40:52,537 --> 00:40:54,147
I'll start from the beginning.

670
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:56,541
My name is Deadpool,
and I'm an X-Man.

671
00:40:56,584 --> 00:40:58,543
Trainee! Shut it!

672
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,763
Look, I get it.

673
00:41:02,938 --> 00:41:04,549
All right, you're scared.

674
00:41:05,114 --> 00:41:06,202
Alone.

675
00:41:06,246 --> 00:41:07,334
You got no family.

676
00:41:07,377 --> 00:41:08,442
I didn't have
a family, either.

677
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,206
You live in this dump.
Guess what?

678
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,947
I used to live in a shithole
just like it.

679
00:41:12,861 --> 00:41:14,210
But you know something?

680
00:41:14,254 --> 00:41:15,995
A wise woman
once said to me...

681
00:41:16,038 --> 00:41:17,518
"Speak up."

682
00:41:17,562 --> 00:41:20,390
"I can't hear you with that
pity dick in your mouth."

683
00:41:20,434 --> 00:41:22,044
Too much? I went too far.

684
00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:31,532
That was effervescent.

685
00:41:31,576 --> 00:41:33,839
Stay in school, kid.

686
00:41:33,882 --> 00:41:35,710
Or don't. I didn't.

687
00:41:35,754 --> 00:41:37,364
And I'm an X-Man.

688
00:41:37,407 --> 00:41:38,539
Trainee.

689
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:39,932
Fuck it!

690
00:41:39,975 --> 00:41:41,716
Superhero landing coming up!

691
00:41:45,328 --> 00:41:46,982
Ah, fuck, fuck, fuck!

692
00:41:47,026 --> 00:41:49,115
That is so not practical.

693
00:42:09,614 --> 00:42:11,746
I could get used
to this X-Man shit.

694
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:12,941
Trainee!

695
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:14,183
Trainee!

696
00:42:14,227 --> 00:42:16,011
Get a power restraint
on him. Now!

697
00:42:16,055 --> 00:42:19,275
Calm down, squirt.
It's over. We got ya.

698
00:42:21,147 --> 00:42:22,670
What's that do?

699
00:42:22,714 --> 00:42:24,237
Power-dampening collar.

700
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,586
Shuts down
all mutant abilities.

701
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:28,458
You can't get it off.
Unless you've got a grenade.

702
00:42:28,502 --> 00:42:31,505
Huh. Could've used
one of those in the first act.

703
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,767
Thank you!

704
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:36,858
That was absolutely thrilling.

705
00:42:36,902 --> 00:42:39,121
True heroism in action.

706
00:42:39,165 --> 00:42:40,819
We are in your debt.

707
00:42:41,646 --> 00:42:43,299
We can take it from here.

708
00:42:43,343 --> 00:42:45,563
Take me
to the Ice Box, please!

709
00:42:45,606 --> 00:42:46,781
Anywhere's better than here.

710
00:42:46,825 --> 00:42:48,087
Believe me, son,

711
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,871
you do not wanna go
to the Ice Box.

712
00:42:49,915 --> 00:42:52,526
That place makes Hitler's anus
look like Waikiki.

713
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,441
Let's get you inside,
young man.

714
00:42:54,484 --> 00:42:56,486
No, wait, wait. Wait.

715
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,010
You guys stay there.

716
00:43:08,107 --> 00:43:09,717
Those guys hurt you?

717
00:43:11,153 --> 00:43:12,198
Who?

718
00:43:14,243 --> 00:43:16,942
Baldilocks? Jared Kushner?

719
00:43:18,421 --> 00:43:19,901
Both of 'em?

720
00:43:23,644 --> 00:43:25,341
Oh, fuck it.

721
00:43:25,385 --> 00:43:26,952
Four or five moments!

722
00:43:26,995 --> 00:43:28,040
I'm sorry?

723
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:31,260
Four or five moments!

724
00:43:32,522 --> 00:43:35,264
That's all it takes
to be a hero.

725
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:38,616
People think
you wake up a hero...

726
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:40,792
brush your teeth a hero...

727
00:43:40,835 --> 00:43:43,751
ejaculate into
a soap dispenser a hero.

728
00:43:45,187 --> 00:43:48,887
But, no, being a hero
takes only a few moments!

729
00:43:50,236 --> 00:43:51,890
A few moments...

730
00:43:51,933 --> 00:43:54,632
doing the ugly stuff
no one else will do.

731
00:43:58,113 --> 00:43:59,245
No!

732
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,181
Stand down!
Hold your fire!

733
00:44:03,205 --> 00:44:05,555
Wade, what did you do? Colossus, no!

734
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,863
You were right, Wade.
You are not X-Men material.

735
00:44:08,907 --> 00:44:11,213
No shit, Shiny Gandhi!

736
00:44:11,257 --> 00:44:12,737
What was your first clue?

737
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,914
The hollow point
through that fuckhead's face?

738
00:44:15,957 --> 00:44:17,263
That kid was abused!

739
00:44:17,306 --> 00:44:19,352
- You can always tell!
- We have rules!

740
00:44:19,395 --> 00:44:22,137
You are not judge,
jury or executioner!

741
00:44:22,181 --> 00:44:25,140
Fuck your rules!
I fight for what's right!

742
00:44:25,184 --> 00:44:27,012
And sometimes
you gotta fight dirty!

743
00:44:27,055 --> 00:44:30,102
You let me down
for the last time, Wade.

744
00:44:33,235 --> 00:44:35,542
Okay,
get these guys in the pod.

745
00:44:35,585 --> 00:44:37,762
Take them to the Ice Box.

746
00:44:58,391 --> 00:44:59,392
Hey, baby!

747
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,743
I wonder what gang
I'll be in.

748
00:45:02,787 --> 00:45:04,266
Yeah!

749
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:06,573
- Is there, like, a Sorting Hat?
- Hi.

750
00:45:08,444 --> 00:45:09,837
I've always seen myself as

751
00:45:09,881 --> 00:45:11,273
more of
an East Coast Hufflepuff.

752
00:45:12,797 --> 00:45:15,756
I've made a critical error
on my Airbnb reservation.

753
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,673
This is not what the website
looked like at all.

754
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,981
I love the decor though.

755
00:45:23,024 --> 00:45:24,983
I had no idea
hopeless was a color.

756
00:45:25,026 --> 00:45:26,288
Hard left, douchebag.

757
00:45:30,815 --> 00:45:32,033
Please, after you.

758
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:36,864
Another disgusting minority
off the streets.

759
00:45:36,908 --> 00:45:38,039
We'll sleep well tonight.

760
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:39,127
Let's get a bagel.

761
00:45:42,391 --> 00:45:45,220
Nighty-night,
you annoying prick!

762
00:46:20,995 --> 00:46:22,886
You're a long way
from your superpowers.

763
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:25,347
Yeah. Just a touch of cancer.

764
00:46:25,391 --> 00:46:27,872
Not to worry,
we're old friends.

765
00:46:27,915 --> 00:46:29,134
Fuck!

766
00:46:29,177 --> 00:46:31,353
I wanted to be a superhero.

767
00:46:31,397 --> 00:46:33,355
Always wanted
a real super suit.

768
00:46:33,399 --> 00:46:34,966
What happened?

769
00:46:35,009 --> 00:46:37,129
When was the last time you saw
a plus-sized superhero?

770
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,274
Never.

771
00:46:39,318 --> 00:46:41,102
The industry discriminates.

772
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:44,279
Fuck superheroes.

773
00:46:44,323 --> 00:46:46,586
The thing that
pisses me off the most...

774
00:46:46,629 --> 00:46:48,457
I never stood up
for myself in there.

775
00:46:50,068 --> 00:46:52,984
My whole life.

776
00:46:53,027 --> 00:46:56,509
I've been waiting for someone
to come and save me.

777
00:46:58,903 --> 00:47:01,862
Nobody's gonna sacrifice
anything for me.

778
00:47:05,997 --> 00:47:08,260
I gotta start taking care
of myself.

779
00:47:09,609 --> 00:47:12,351
I have a mission now.

780
00:47:12,394 --> 00:47:15,049
The first thing I wanna do
when I get out of here...

781
00:47:15,093 --> 00:47:17,443
burn the headmaster alive...

782
00:47:17,486 --> 00:47:21,186
and then take a selfie
with his smoldering corpse.

783
00:47:21,229 --> 00:47:23,666
Aw. That's, like,
my favorite part of the Bible.

784
00:47:25,407 --> 00:47:27,888
I don't have
a sock puppet on me...

785
00:47:27,932 --> 00:47:29,977
but what did he do to you?

786
00:47:30,021 --> 00:47:31,631
Did he taste the rainbow?

787
00:47:31,674 --> 00:47:33,720
I'd whisper it,
but Skittles would sue us.

788
00:47:34,895 --> 00:47:36,897
Fucker hates mutants.

789
00:47:36,941 --> 00:47:38,899
He tried to beat
the genes out of us.

790
00:47:38,943 --> 00:47:41,467
Nothing worse than
a "pray the gay away" type guy.

791
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,643
Sick piece of shit.

792
00:47:45,036 --> 00:47:48,735
Tomorrow, we'll find
the biggest guy in here...

793
00:47:49,692 --> 00:47:51,390
and we'll make him our bitch!

794
00:47:55,307 --> 00:47:56,656
What was that?

795
00:47:56,699 --> 00:47:59,267
That is the biggest guy
in here.

796
00:47:59,311 --> 00:48:01,400
Fun fact about the Ice Box...

797
00:48:01,443 --> 00:48:03,271
though no one's ever seen it,

798
00:48:03,315 --> 00:48:05,534
they keep a monster
in the basement.

799
00:48:05,578 --> 00:48:07,319
Right next to a huge,

800
00:48:07,362 --> 00:48:08,886
steaming bowl
of foreshadowing.

801
00:48:09,538 --> 00:48:10,539
Look.

802
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,803
I can't protect you.

803
00:48:13,847 --> 00:48:14,979
With this collar on,

804
00:48:15,022 --> 00:48:18,156
my superpower
is just unbridled cancer.

805
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:21,681
Give me a bow and arrow,
I'm basically Hawkeye.

806
00:48:21,724 --> 00:48:23,813
Now, if you'll excuse me...

807
00:48:23,857 --> 00:48:27,034
I've got tumors to grow.
Vanessa awaits.

808
00:48:27,078 --> 00:48:29,558
I'll start by making us
a shank.

809
00:48:29,602 --> 00:48:31,517
Good listening. I stole that guard's pen...

810
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,519
and stashed it
in the old prison wallet,

811
00:48:33,562 --> 00:48:34,955
if you know what I'm saying.

812
00:48:34,999 --> 00:48:37,479
I really hope I don't know
what you're saying.

813
00:48:39,568 --> 00:48:41,919
I know it's in there,
I just need to get it out.

814
00:48:41,962 --> 00:48:44,051
Oh, Jesus Christ.

815
00:48:44,095 --> 00:48:46,749
I can hear you
rummaging around in there.

816
00:48:46,793 --> 00:48:49,187
Do they make Purell
for your ears?

817
00:48:53,713 --> 00:48:55,073
And to update you

818
00:48:55,106 --> 00:48:56,498
on the story reported earlier,

819
00:48:56,542 --> 00:48:58,239
after a lengthy standoff

820
00:48:58,283 --> 00:49:00,894
outside the Essex House
for Mutant Rehabilitation...

821
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,243
two mutants were arrested

822
00:49:02,287 --> 00:49:04,028
and transported
to the Ice Box...

823
00:49:04,071 --> 00:49:05,551
Entering repair mode.

824
00:49:09,903 --> 00:49:11,489
...several
police cars were destroyed

825
00:49:11,513 --> 00:49:13,341
and the X-Men were called in
to restore order.

826
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:36,582
Cells seven and nine

827
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:40,020
now off-limits
for medical personnel.

828
00:49:40,064 --> 00:49:41,543
Cells seven and nine

829
00:49:41,587 --> 00:49:44,329
now off-limits
for medical personnel.

830
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:47,462
Psst!

831
00:49:49,769 --> 00:49:52,119
Don't do that.

832
00:49:52,163 --> 00:49:55,035
What? Why are you
winking at me?

833
00:49:58,647 --> 00:50:00,040
I got your back.

834
00:50:00,084 --> 00:50:01,302
Oh, my God.

835
00:50:01,346 --> 00:50:02,869
You're sick,
I gotta protect you.

836
00:50:02,912 --> 00:50:04,827
Just leave me alone, kid.

837
00:50:05,959 --> 00:50:07,004
Oh, great.

838
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:11,399
Well, hello there, new fish.

839
00:50:11,443 --> 00:50:14,489
It's nice to see some
fresh faces around here.

840
00:50:14,533 --> 00:50:16,796
I've done some
light catalog work...

841
00:50:16,839 --> 00:50:19,320
but, really, modeling is just
a stepping stone to acting.

842
00:50:19,364 --> 00:50:22,149
I was talking to him.Oh.

843
00:50:22,193 --> 00:50:25,587
Have we met?
I can't place your mustache.

844
00:50:25,631 --> 00:50:28,286
Black Tom Cassidy. White Wade Wilson.

845
00:50:28,329 --> 00:50:31,767
What's your superpower?
Cultural appropriation?

846
00:50:31,811 --> 00:50:34,379
You're supposed to be
the toughest cunt in here.

847
00:50:34,422 --> 00:50:36,990
You don't look
like much to me.

848
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:39,471
First rule of the yard,
fuckface...

849
00:50:39,514 --> 00:50:41,560
find the biggest guy
and make him your...

850
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:47,609
Second biggest guy.

851
00:50:47,653 --> 00:50:50,090
The last thing I need
is more hepatitis.

852
00:50:50,134 --> 00:50:53,702
Oh, it's slippery, too.
This table needs a wipe down!

853
00:50:53,746 --> 00:50:55,574
Can we get a wipe down
on the table?

854
00:50:56,879 --> 00:50:59,099
Kid, I think you picked
the wrong side.

855
00:50:59,143 --> 00:51:01,493
No, I didn't!
He's my friend!

856
00:51:01,536 --> 00:51:03,799
Zip it. We're not friends.

857
00:51:05,497 --> 00:51:06,777
You're about to get
dick-slapped.

858
00:51:19,163 --> 00:51:20,903
I had so much fun!
You were like...

859
00:51:20,947 --> 00:51:23,036
And I was like,
"Take a seat, shit dick."

860
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,820
Just let me die in peace.

861
00:51:24,864 --> 00:51:26,996
We make a great team!

862
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,608
Oh, God! We're not a team.

863
00:51:29,651 --> 00:51:34,003
Why'd you say that back there?
We're friends, partners.

864
00:51:34,047 --> 00:51:36,441
We're not partners
or friends.

865
00:51:37,877 --> 00:51:39,966
This doesn't end with us
riding into the sunset.

866
00:51:40,009 --> 00:51:42,186
It ends with me
dying of cancer...

867
00:51:42,229 --> 00:51:46,103
and you winning the Ice Box
award for softest mouth.

868
00:51:47,539 --> 00:51:49,149
There's only one person
in this world

869
00:51:49,193 --> 00:51:50,977
that I care about,
and she's gone.

870
00:51:52,761 --> 00:51:55,938
You wanna survive?

871
00:51:55,982 --> 00:51:59,290
Stop trying to shank
the biggest guys in here...

872
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:01,205
and make friends with them.

873
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:04,121
Make friends with someone.

874
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:06,949
Anyone but me.

875
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,431
Maybe even Black Tim.

876
00:52:11,345 --> 00:52:12,955
Black Evan, I don't know.

877
00:52:12,999 --> 00:52:15,480
All I remember is
he was African-American.

878
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,049
System malfunctioning.

879
00:53:03,092 --> 00:53:06,444
Cells 7, 12, 14, 27.

880
00:53:06,487 --> 00:53:08,750
Back in your cells, you filthy
mutants! Get in there!

881
00:53:08,794 --> 00:53:12,101
Cells 1, 3, 7, 8.

882
00:53:13,277 --> 00:53:14,717
Searching.

883
00:53:16,236 --> 00:53:18,586
Cell 04 located.

884
00:53:19,979 --> 00:53:22,111
Door won't open!

885
00:53:22,155 --> 00:53:23,765
On your fucking knees!

886
00:54:00,715 --> 00:54:02,413
That was our cell.

887
00:54:04,545 --> 00:54:06,852
What did I do to piss off
a grumpy old fucker

888
00:54:06,895 --> 00:54:08,070
with a Winter Soldier arm?

889
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:19,256
Get away from me, kid!

890
00:54:26,872 --> 00:54:28,090
Listen to me! Go!

891
00:54:33,574 --> 00:54:34,880
Hello, Russell.

892
00:56:18,462 --> 00:56:19,463
Who are you?

893
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,595
I'm Batman.

894
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:34,086
Ooh!

895
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:41,702
Oh. That's got some zip.

896
00:56:50,232 --> 00:56:53,018
Don't feel bad.
Even I can't kill me.

897
00:56:53,714 --> 00:56:55,281
Talk!

898
00:56:55,324 --> 00:56:57,109
What kind of
spineless shit stick

899
00:56:57,152 --> 00:56:58,502
tries to kill
a 14-year-old boy?

900
00:56:59,807 --> 00:57:01,330
You might wanna start talking!

901
00:57:01,374 --> 00:57:03,614
'Cause I got a long history of
firing at times like this!

902
00:57:04,986 --> 00:57:06,988
The name's Cable.

903
00:57:07,032 --> 00:57:09,687
I'm from the future.
Just walk away.

904
00:57:10,383 --> 00:57:11,689
Oh!

905
00:57:11,732 --> 00:57:13,691
So, you're from the future.

906
00:57:13,734 --> 00:57:15,693
I have
three questions then.

907
00:57:15,736 --> 00:57:19,348
One, is dubstep still a thing?

908
00:57:19,392 --> 00:57:21,873
Two, do people still homebrew?

909
00:57:21,916 --> 00:57:24,484
And three,
does Dopinder ever find love?

910
00:58:08,659 --> 00:58:10,443
Dubstep's for pussies.

911
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:11,792
You're so dark!

912
00:58:11,836 --> 00:58:13,925
Are you sure you're not
from the DC universe?

913
00:58:14,665 --> 00:58:16,231
I love dubstep!

914
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,955
Is that a fanny pack?

915
00:58:43,998 --> 00:58:46,566
I used to have one of those
in 1990-never.

916
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:49,656
Something to remember you by.

917
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:53,486
Give me that back!
That goes with me everywhere.

918
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,880
Like the memory
of your fucking fanny pack!

919
00:59:05,629 --> 00:59:07,718
Why are you protecting
the kid?

920
00:59:09,023 --> 00:59:11,330
I don't give a fuck
about him...

921
00:59:11,373 --> 00:59:13,767
and his Are You My Mother?
complex!

922
00:59:16,117 --> 00:59:17,379
What's this one do?

923
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,178
In every film,
there's a moment

924
00:59:33,221 --> 00:59:35,615
when the hero
hits rock bottom.

925
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:37,617
InCool Runnings,
it was when John Candy's

926
00:59:37,661 --> 00:59:39,619
prized bobsled broke.

927
00:59:39,663 --> 00:59:42,404
InHuman Centipede,
it was when those people...

928
00:59:42,448 --> 00:59:44,015
signed on to be in that movie.

929
00:59:44,058 --> 00:59:46,191
But in this film, well...

930
00:59:46,234 --> 00:59:47,453
you're looking at it.

931
00:59:47,496 --> 00:59:49,237
On your fucking knees, mutant.

932
00:59:52,153 --> 00:59:53,154
Rock...

933
00:59:57,202 --> 00:59:58,682
meet bottom.

934
01:00:09,388 --> 01:00:10,539
I love you, Wade Wilson.

935
01:00:10,563 --> 01:00:11,738
Ness?

936
01:00:12,783 --> 01:00:14,262
Hey, Ness!

937
01:00:15,133 --> 01:00:16,961
Ness, can you let me in?

938
01:00:17,004 --> 01:00:19,093
Please! Please.

939
01:00:21,269 --> 01:00:22,401
Jesus.

940
01:00:25,317 --> 01:00:27,077
You're not giving me
a lot of direction here.

941
01:00:27,101 --> 01:00:28,929
I'm at the end of my rope.

942
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:33,760
Then I joined the X-Men.

943
01:00:33,804 --> 01:00:35,632
I went to prison. I, uh...

944
01:00:39,723 --> 01:00:41,246
Is it the kid?

945
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:46,207
Kids give us a chance to be
better than we used to be.

946
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:48,645
The kid!

947
01:01:02,267 --> 01:01:03,877
That's exactly what she meant.

948
01:01:03,921 --> 01:01:05,333
Your heart needs to be
in the right place.

949
01:01:05,357 --> 01:01:07,228
I'm not gonna
abandon this kid.

950
01:01:07,272 --> 01:01:09,883
He's never had anyone, ever.

951
01:01:09,927 --> 01:01:11,276
I need to be selfless.

952
01:01:11,319 --> 01:01:13,278
Yeah, but what does
that mean?

953
01:01:13,321 --> 01:01:16,585
It means
I'm gonna save Russell.

954
01:01:16,629 --> 01:01:18,152
Maybe I couldn't
save Vanessa...

955
01:01:18,196 --> 01:01:21,199
but maybe I can save a robust
teenager from New Zealand.

956
01:01:21,242 --> 01:01:23,307
Yeah, but what I mean is,
like, the world "selfless."

957
01:01:23,331 --> 01:01:24,855
I literally don't know
what that means.

958
01:01:24,898 --> 01:01:26,073
Jesus Christ.

959
01:01:26,117 --> 01:01:28,859
Okay, look.
According to my guy, okay...

960
01:01:28,902 --> 01:01:30,730
those muties
are being transferred

961
01:01:30,774 --> 01:01:32,601
to a supermax, 80 miles away.

962
01:01:32,645 --> 01:01:34,473
Great, I'll pick 'em off
along the way.

963
01:01:34,516 --> 01:01:36,693
Hold your testicles there,
buddy, okay?

964
01:01:36,736 --> 01:01:38,738
We're talking about
an armored convoy...

965
01:01:38,782 --> 01:01:41,393
and a vicious super soldier
from the future...

966
01:01:41,436 --> 01:01:43,787
that is looking to turn your
skull into a fuckable ashtray.

967
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:45,310
You know what we need to do?

968
01:01:45,353 --> 01:01:47,225
We need to build
a fucking team.

969
01:01:47,268 --> 01:01:49,357
We need 'em tough,
morally flexible...

970
01:01:49,401 --> 01:01:50,794
and young enough
so they can carry

971
01:01:50,837 --> 01:01:52,032
this franchise 10 to 12 years.

972
01:01:52,056 --> 01:01:53,927
A team of
highly-skilled motherfuckers.

973
01:01:53,971 --> 01:01:57,017
I'm talking about some
Ocean's 14shit. Rogue Two.

974
01:01:57,061 --> 01:01:59,498
John Wick 3,but with
the original director.

975
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:01,456
My body is an
instrument of death.

976
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,849
Not now, Dopinder.

977
01:02:02,893 --> 01:02:04,372
I could be of great use.

978
01:02:04,416 --> 01:02:05,983
What's your superpower?

979
01:02:07,811 --> 01:02:09,464
Courage. That's adorable.

980
01:02:09,508 --> 01:02:11,181
Do you have the courage
to check and see...

981
01:02:11,205 --> 01:02:13,599
if there are enough sanitary
napkins in the dispenser?

982
01:02:13,642 --> 01:02:14,687
Yes, sir.

983
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:15,993
I'm sorry
you had to see that,

984
01:02:16,036 --> 01:02:18,386
although I'm glad
you heard it.

985
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:20,345
All right, I'll put out
a call for resumes.

986
01:02:20,388 --> 01:02:22,651
But we're not paying
medical or dental.

987
01:02:22,695 --> 01:02:24,741
It's time to get back
on LinkedIn.

988
01:03:01,603 --> 01:03:03,257
Attention, all inmates!

989
01:03:03,301 --> 01:03:05,738
Transport to Cross Force
Maximum Security

990
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,261
Mutant Containment Facility...

991
01:03:07,305 --> 01:03:09,263
will begin at 0800 hours.

992
01:03:09,307 --> 01:03:11,309
Inspection of your cells
and out processing

993
01:03:11,352 --> 01:03:13,398
will begin at 0600.

994
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:22,799
Oi.

995
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:24,191
What the fuck
do you want?

996
01:03:24,235 --> 01:03:26,063
That's my fucking pudding.

997
01:03:26,106 --> 01:03:28,108
Fuck your pudding! You like pudding?

998
01:03:49,129 --> 01:03:50,130
Hello?

999
01:03:52,437 --> 01:03:54,787
I know you're in there.

1000
01:04:10,455 --> 01:04:12,761
Must be hard
being the biggest guy in here.

1001
01:04:14,024 --> 01:04:16,330
Lonely at the top, eh?

1002
01:04:16,374 --> 01:04:18,332
They're moving us tomorrow.

1003
01:04:20,813 --> 01:04:22,597
Maybe I can get you
out of here.

1004
01:04:23,816 --> 01:04:26,950
And we can make
the whole world our bitch.

1005
01:04:28,821 --> 01:04:30,562
We need a secret code.

1006
01:04:33,782 --> 01:04:36,220
No,
that's stupid, Russell. Idiot.

1007
01:04:43,488 --> 01:04:45,011
We're a team.

1008
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:47,013
We're like thugs,
we're like gangsters.

1009
01:04:47,057 --> 01:04:50,712
I'm like Tupac,
and you're like Ice Cube.

1010
01:04:50,756 --> 01:04:51,864
Supposedly,
she can rap, too.

1011
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:52,976
Yeah.

1012
01:04:53,019 --> 01:04:54,064
I like that.

1013
01:04:54,107 --> 01:04:55,761
Terrific,
these are all terrific.

1014
01:04:55,804 --> 01:04:57,545
Meet Bedlam.

1015
01:04:57,589 --> 01:04:59,852
Cool name! Superpowers?

1016
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,419
I can distort
electrical fields.

1017
01:05:02,637 --> 01:05:04,857
Including the one
inside your brain...

1018
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:07,599
causing anxiety, confusion...

1019
01:05:07,642 --> 01:05:09,644
pain.

1020
01:05:09,688 --> 01:05:11,777
So, basically,
you're Dave Matthews.

1021
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:12,952
We can use him.

1022
01:05:14,736 --> 01:05:16,390
I'm Zeitgeist.

1023
01:05:16,434 --> 01:05:17,739
Cool. I like it.

1024
01:05:17,783 --> 01:05:19,045
So you have the power

1025
01:05:19,089 --> 01:05:21,439
to put your finger
on the pulse of society?

1026
01:05:22,483 --> 01:05:23,658
No.

1027
01:05:23,702 --> 01:05:25,269
No, I spit acidic vomit.

1028
01:05:25,312 --> 01:05:26,444
Oh.Do you want me

1029
01:05:26,487 --> 01:05:27,880
to demonstrate? DEADPOOL: No!

1030
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:29,403
We'll take
your word for it.

1031
01:05:29,447 --> 01:05:31,599
Thank you. Yeah. Listen,
we've all eaten at Arby's, okay?

1032
01:05:31,623 --> 01:05:34,234
And this is the Vanisher.

1033
01:05:37,585 --> 01:05:38,586
But...

1034
01:05:39,761 --> 01:05:41,241
Vanisher!

1035
01:05:43,765 --> 01:05:45,419
Nice! Right?

1036
01:05:46,725 --> 01:05:47,856
He's not here, is he?

1037
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:49,423
He may be running late.

1038
01:05:51,034 --> 01:05:53,862
My name's Rusty,
but I go by Shatterstar.

1039
01:05:53,906 --> 01:05:55,125
That's good, yeah.

1040
01:05:55,168 --> 01:05:57,301
"Rusty" is terrible.Toughie.

1041
01:05:57,344 --> 01:06:00,173
So, uh, where are you from?
The planet Mojo World.

1042
01:06:00,217 --> 01:06:02,262
So you're an alien, I guess. Bad name.

1043
01:06:02,306 --> 01:06:04,003
How does that, uh, help us?

1044
01:06:04,047 --> 01:06:06,963
I'm basically better
than you at everything.

1045
01:06:07,006 --> 01:06:08,723
Just once, I'm gonna find
a planet of people

1046
01:06:08,747 --> 01:06:10,314
that are worse than me
at everything.

1047
01:06:10,357 --> 01:06:12,577
A whole bunch
of functional idiots.

1048
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:14,555
I'm gonna go there, and I'm
gonna be their Superman.

1049
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:15,710
Isn't that Canada?

1050
01:06:15,754 --> 01:06:18,148
You shut your
goddamn trash mouth!

1051
01:06:19,323 --> 01:06:20,846
Meet... Domino.

1052
01:06:20,889 --> 01:06:22,935
What's your shtick? I'm lucky.

1053
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,371
That's not a superpower.

1054
01:06:24,415 --> 01:06:25,546
Yeah, it is. No, it isn't.

1055
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:26,852
Yes, it is. No, it isn't.

1056
01:06:26,895 --> 01:06:27,940
Yeah, it is. No, it isn't.

1057
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,028
Yes, it is. No, it isn't.

1058
01:06:29,072 --> 01:06:30,092
Yeah, it is. Really isn't.

1059
01:06:30,116 --> 01:06:31,335
No, it isn't.Yes, it is.

1060
01:06:31,378 --> 01:06:32,553
Told you.

1061
01:06:32,597 --> 01:06:33,946
Get out of my head!

1062
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,600
I'm not in your head.

1063
01:06:35,643 --> 01:06:36,993
I'm in an
11-year-old's bedroom.

1064
01:06:37,036 --> 01:06:38,168
Well, if you're so lucky,

1065
01:06:38,211 --> 01:06:39,821
then what are you
doing here with us?

1066
01:06:39,865 --> 01:06:40,997
I don't know yet.

1067
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,563
What's that supposed to mean?

1068
01:06:42,607 --> 01:06:43,888
There's a reason why I'm here,
and I'll know when I know.

1069
01:06:43,912 --> 01:06:45,716
Everything usually
just kind of works out for me.

1070
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:47,568
Like 2008 Ryan Reynolds.

1071
01:06:48,874 --> 01:06:50,006
I don't know who that is.

1072
01:06:50,049 --> 01:06:51,529
You're hired.

1073
01:06:51,572 --> 01:06:52,617
Lucky me.

1074
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:53,879
I like her!

1075
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,316
And last, but not least...

1076
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:57,491
Peter.

1077
01:06:58,884 --> 01:07:01,408
Am I getting
catfished here or...?

1078
01:07:01,452 --> 01:07:03,367
Any powers you wanna
tell us about?

1079
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:05,021
No.

1080
01:07:05,064 --> 01:07:06,761
I don't have one.

1081
01:07:06,805 --> 01:07:08,111
Um, I just saw the ad.

1082
01:07:08,154 --> 01:07:09,938
No superpowers at all?

1083
01:07:09,982 --> 01:07:13,072
Uh, I have both
Type 1 and 2 Diabetes.

1084
01:07:13,594 --> 01:07:14,943
Ow! Oh!

1085
01:07:14,987 --> 01:07:16,119
That's all the diabetes.

1086
01:07:16,162 --> 01:07:17,468
Right?
Yeah, you got 'em all.

1087
01:07:17,511 --> 01:07:19,426
If you find a Type 3,
let us know.

1088
01:07:19,948 --> 01:07:20,993
Yeah.

1089
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:22,125
You're in.

1090
01:07:22,168 --> 01:07:23,691
Yeah. Fuck!

1091
01:07:26,085 --> 01:07:27,478
It's fulfilling work.

1092
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:33,875
Let's go!

1093
01:07:47,498 --> 01:07:50,109
This is Convoy 17
departing the Ice Box.

1094
01:07:50,153 --> 01:07:51,502
We are en route.

1095
01:07:59,118 --> 01:08:01,468
Peacetime makes people soft.

1096
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,863
I was born into war.

1097
01:08:06,386 --> 01:08:07,561
Bred into it.

1098
01:08:08,693 --> 01:08:10,477
Okay.

1099
01:08:10,521 --> 01:08:12,871
What's the most pain
you've ever felt?

1100
01:08:14,829 --> 01:08:16,092
These restraints are pretty...

1101
01:08:16,135 --> 01:08:18,006
People think
they understand pain.

1102
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:19,486
They have no concept of it

1103
01:08:19,530 --> 01:08:21,488
beyond their own
worst experience.

1104
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:26,276
5 years old. That's what?

1105
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:27,886
A bee sting.

1106
01:08:27,929 --> 01:08:29,061
Oh, yeah.

1107
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,629
20 years old, shrapnel.

1108
01:08:31,672 --> 01:08:34,371
40 years old, disease.

1109
01:08:34,414 --> 01:08:38,984
Maybe the kind that leaves you
more machine than man.

1110
01:08:39,027 --> 01:08:40,427
Yeah, getting old's
not for sissies.

1111
01:08:40,464 --> 01:08:42,118
That's what my
Grandma Ginny used to...

1112
01:08:42,161 --> 01:08:43,336
I've got a list.

1113
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,078
We're gonna work down it.

1114
01:08:46,774 --> 01:08:47,775
Together.

1115
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:51,997
Number one,
I'm gonna bend something.

1116
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,347
Something that was not
meant to bend.

1117
01:08:54,391 --> 01:08:55,542
I'm gonna
stop you right there

1118
01:08:55,566 --> 01:08:56,891
because I'm not gonna
make it to two.

1119
01:08:56,915 --> 01:08:58,221
I won't even
make it to one.

1120
01:08:58,264 --> 01:09:00,005
I don't do well with pain,
you know.

1121
01:09:00,048 --> 01:09:02,399
If I stub my toe,
I'm done for the day.

1122
01:09:02,442 --> 01:09:04,836
I cried when they
canceled Felicity.

1123
01:09:04,879 --> 01:09:06,727
When I get really scared,
I get nervous erections.

1124
01:09:06,751 --> 01:09:08,144
I have one right now.

1125
01:09:08,187 --> 01:09:09,754
Don't look.
It'll only make it worse.

1126
01:09:09,797 --> 01:09:10,929
I don't want you
to hurt me,

1127
01:09:10,972 --> 01:09:13,149
and I'll tell you
anything you wanna know.

1128
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,282
Except for where they are.

1129
01:09:16,326 --> 01:09:17,607
Russell's in a convoy
heading southbound

1130
01:09:17,631 --> 01:09:19,024
on Gerry Duggan Parkway.

1131
01:09:19,067 --> 01:09:20,393
The monster's with them.
I wouldn't fuck with him.

1132
01:09:20,417 --> 01:09:21,896
You all know the plan.

1133
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:23,681
Intercept the convoy,

1134
01:09:23,724 --> 01:09:25,726
grab the boy.
But not inappropriately!

1135
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:27,119
You know what,

1136
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,686
I wouldn't fuck with
Deadpool either.

1137
01:09:28,729 --> 01:09:30,862
Because he's built a team.
He's unstoppable.

1138
01:09:30,905 --> 01:09:33,604
He has an ass pen.
He'll stab you with it.

1139
01:09:33,647 --> 01:09:36,259
Watch out for this guy, Cable!

1140
01:09:36,302 --> 01:09:39,566
He's very short, 5'11".
Not like in the comics.

1141
01:09:39,610 --> 01:09:42,700
And if we succeed,
we all go home early.

1142
01:09:42,743 --> 01:09:44,823
So if you go after
them, Cable, I warn you...

1143
01:09:45,616 --> 01:09:47,313
there's a wind advisory
in effect.

1144
01:09:58,455 --> 01:10:00,095
A little turbulent up here.

1145
01:10:07,464 --> 01:10:09,248
I don't know much
about this Cable fella...

1146
01:10:09,292 --> 01:10:10,684
but I guarantee
he hasn't killed

1147
01:10:10,728 --> 01:10:12,469
as many people
as melanoma has.

1148
01:10:13,861 --> 01:10:15,254
We're getting close!

1149
01:10:15,298 --> 01:10:16,995
As a former X-Man...

1150
01:10:17,038 --> 01:10:18,953
Trainee. Thank you, Bedlam.

1151
01:10:18,997 --> 01:10:21,347
I was always appalled
by the blatant sexism

1152
01:10:21,391 --> 01:10:23,001
in the group's name.

1153
01:10:23,044 --> 01:10:25,090
X-Men! Men!

1154
01:10:25,133 --> 01:10:28,136
The point is, our group
will be forward thinking.

1155
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:29,486
Gender neutral.

1156
01:10:29,529 --> 01:10:31,836
From now on,
we'll be known as...

1157
01:10:34,099 --> 01:10:35,448
X-Force.

1158
01:10:35,492 --> 01:10:37,276
Isn't that
a little derivative?

1159
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,713
I don't recall asking
your opinion, Peter!

1160
01:10:40,975 --> 01:10:42,412
That wasn't me.

1161
01:10:49,462 --> 01:10:51,812
Hang the laundry out
at 1,300 feet...

1162
01:10:51,856 --> 01:10:53,684
intercept the convoy,
and grab the boy.

1163
01:10:53,727 --> 01:10:54,835
Let's bring on
the carnage, baby!

1164
01:10:54,859 --> 01:10:56,730
Get me on the ground,
watch me go!

1165
01:10:56,774 --> 01:10:57,905
Yeah!

1166
01:10:57,949 --> 01:10:59,646
I can't wait to kill!

1167
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:02,432
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1168
01:11:02,475 --> 01:11:05,173
I just wanna say
how proud I am of this team.

1169
01:11:05,217 --> 01:11:08,089
You know,
you guys look amazing!

1170
01:11:08,133 --> 01:11:11,005
Vanisher, I have no doubt
you look amazing too.

1171
01:11:11,049 --> 01:11:12,180
This is the family

1172
01:11:12,224 --> 01:11:13,904
that I've always dreamed
of having and I...

1173
01:11:14,661 --> 01:11:15,749
Ah, shit.

1174
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,057
I just get a little choked up
sometimes.

1175
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:20,928
I hate to interrupt,
but is anybody nervous

1176
01:11:20,972 --> 01:11:22,321
about the high winds?

1177
01:11:22,365 --> 01:11:23,714
Gary. My name's Peter.

1178
01:11:23,757 --> 01:11:25,672
I realize that you're
new to this, but relax.

1179
01:11:25,716 --> 01:11:27,370
You've been chosen
by a higher power.

1180
01:11:27,413 --> 01:11:29,720
Did he just call himself God?
I think he did.

1181
01:11:29,763 --> 01:11:31,330
I'd like to go home. And I'd like...

1182
01:11:31,374 --> 01:11:33,898
the McRib to be available
year round,

1183
01:11:33,941 --> 01:11:35,769
but sometimes dreams
don't come true.

1184
01:11:35,813 --> 01:11:37,989
I spent 10 years
in Special Forces.

1185
01:11:38,032 --> 01:11:39,183
You think we didn't
jump out of the plane

1186
01:11:39,207 --> 01:11:41,166
because of a light breeze?

1187
01:11:41,209 --> 01:11:43,473
You're in this shit now,
Mustache!

1188
01:11:43,516 --> 01:11:45,494
I'm only yelling
to impress the other guys.

1189
01:11:45,518 --> 01:11:47,825
I'd never let anything
happen to you, Sugarbear.

1190
01:11:47,868 --> 01:11:50,088
Leonard, hit it!

1191
01:11:58,792 --> 01:12:00,838
Go! Go! Go!

1192
01:12:36,526 --> 01:12:37,962
Let's get some!

1193
01:12:38,005 --> 01:12:39,180
Whoo!

1194
01:12:39,224 --> 01:12:40,399
Oh, yeah!

1195
01:12:40,443 --> 01:12:43,271
Convoy, 12 o'clock!
On my command!

1196
01:12:44,316 --> 01:12:45,796
Deploy! Oh, hey now!

1197
01:12:45,839 --> 01:12:47,101
Whoa!

1198
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:54,282
Little off course here.

1199
01:12:56,459 --> 01:12:59,287
Holy mommy fucking shit!

1200
01:13:00,027 --> 01:13:01,464
Ah, there they are.

1201
01:13:01,507 --> 01:13:05,119
Look at these gorgeous
sons of bitches.

1202
01:13:05,163 --> 01:13:07,078
Oh, yeah!
That's right, Bedlam!

1203
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:16,435
No! Tripping
motherfucking billies!

1204
01:13:16,479 --> 01:13:19,569
Shatterstar.
Okay, you got this.

1205
01:13:20,352 --> 01:13:21,397
Left!

1206
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,789
Left!

1207
01:13:22,833 --> 01:13:25,096
You'd have to be insane
to take off in this.

1208
01:13:25,139 --> 01:13:27,359
No, stage left, you idiot!

1209
01:13:31,276 --> 01:13:32,799
Well, I guess
we found something

1210
01:13:32,843 --> 01:13:33,931
you're not better at.

1211
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:37,456
Vanisher.

1212
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,284
Maybe the wind can't blow
what it can't see.

1213
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:43,854
Oh! Really?

1214
01:13:43,897 --> 01:13:46,247
All right,
we could do this with four.

1215
01:13:46,291 --> 01:13:49,294
Sugarbear.
You got this, buddy!

1216
01:13:49,337 --> 01:13:51,427
That's the stuff!
That's the X-Force spirit!

1217
01:13:52,645 --> 01:13:54,734
Never underestimate
a man with a mustache!

1218
01:13:54,778 --> 01:13:56,344
Just ask anyone in Brooklyn.

1219
01:13:56,388 --> 01:13:57,563
We did it!

1220
01:13:57,607 --> 01:13:59,173
You're a goddamn
superhero, you!

1221
01:13:59,217 --> 01:14:00,305
X-Force!

1222
01:14:00,914 --> 01:14:02,002
X-Force.

1223
01:14:06,398 --> 01:14:08,269
Oh!

1224
01:14:11,969 --> 01:14:13,013
Peter.

1225
01:14:13,057 --> 01:14:14,362
I got you, buddy!

1226
01:14:14,406 --> 01:14:15,601
You're gonna be fine!
This is not good, man!

1227
01:14:15,625 --> 01:14:17,931
You got this, big guy!
Here we go, Peter!

1228
01:14:17,975 --> 01:14:19,455
Look at me.
We're X-Force, right?

1229
01:14:19,498 --> 01:14:21,587
Yeah, we're X-Force. We're X-Force.

1230
01:14:25,635 --> 01:14:27,680
Oh, my God!
What the fuck?

1231
01:14:27,724 --> 01:14:29,726
Fucking acidic vomit!

1232
01:14:31,292 --> 01:14:34,078
Oh, God! I'm gonna throw up
in my mask.

1233
01:14:37,168 --> 01:14:39,562
Okay,
I'm over the convoy.

1234
01:14:39,605 --> 01:14:42,042
Where did the rest
of the team land?

1235
01:14:42,086 --> 01:14:43,740
Good news and bad news.

1236
01:14:43,783 --> 01:14:46,917
Bad news is
the whole team is dead.

1237
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,266
The good news is,

1238
01:14:48,309 --> 01:14:50,137
I don't think anyone's
gonna miss Shatterstar.

1239
01:14:50,181 --> 01:14:53,532
He was a bit of a prick.
Oh, but Paul!

1240
01:14:53,576 --> 01:14:54,577
Peter!

1241
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:56,100
Peter, I'm gonna
miss him most.

1242
01:14:56,143 --> 01:14:57,275
But there is
a slight chance

1243
01:14:57,318 --> 01:14:58,668
Vanisher could make it.

1244
01:14:58,711 --> 01:15:01,322
Nope, no chance. He's dead.

1245
01:15:01,366 --> 01:15:02,541
The whole team?

1246
01:15:02,585 --> 01:15:04,456
Only the main ones.
We're still good.

1247
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,762
Fuck, you are dumb.

1248
01:15:05,805 --> 01:15:07,459
Whoever planned this stunt's

1249
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,679
been smoking
a lot jazz cabbage.

1250
01:15:09,722 --> 01:15:10,854
I'll tell you that much.

1251
01:15:10,897 --> 01:15:12,551
That's pretty obvious!

1252
01:15:12,595 --> 01:15:14,335
Looking good, Vanisher.

1253
01:15:24,171 --> 01:15:26,043
They're headed
into the tunnel.

1254
01:15:27,044 --> 01:15:28,524
I'm that kid's only hope,

1255
01:15:28,567 --> 01:15:30,438
so sit tight
and wait for my word.

1256
01:15:31,178 --> 01:15:32,484
Whatever.

1257
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:34,051
We're gonna lose 'em.
I'm dropping in.

1258
01:15:34,094 --> 01:15:36,488
Uh, that's
a negative, sole survivor.

1259
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:39,056
Luck is not a superpower!
We are so fucked!

1260
01:15:39,099 --> 01:15:42,189
No, we most certainly
are not fucked.

1261
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:47,934
Seriously,
I don't get it!

1262
01:15:47,978 --> 01:15:50,458
What, you shoot luck lasers
out of your eyes?

1263
01:15:52,635 --> 01:15:54,462
It's just
it's hard to picture.

1264
01:15:54,506 --> 01:15:56,595
And certainly
not very cinematic.

1265
01:15:59,293 --> 01:16:00,904
I mean, luck?

1266
01:16:00,947 --> 01:16:03,515
What coked out,
glass pipe-sucking

1267
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:04,908
freakshow comic book artist...

1268
01:16:04,951 --> 01:16:06,605
came up
with that little chestnut?

1269
01:16:06,649 --> 01:16:08,912
Probably a guy
who can't draw feet!

1270
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:23,317
Once again, it all falls
on my shoulders.

1271
01:16:23,361 --> 01:16:24,599
It's why I'm cursed to be
a solo act.

1272
01:16:24,623 --> 01:16:25,644
Wander the Earth... I'm in.

1273
01:16:25,668 --> 01:16:27,191
I'm sorry, what did you say?

1274
01:16:27,234 --> 01:16:28,366
I'm in.

1275
01:16:28,409 --> 01:16:30,281
How in the fuck
are you in already?

1276
01:16:30,716 --> 01:16:32,544
Oh, shit.

1277
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:33,806
It's Cable. 12 o'clock.

1278
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:34,981
Okay.

1279
01:16:35,025 --> 01:16:37,462
New plan. Use all of your
imaginary powers

1280
01:16:37,505 --> 01:16:40,247
to stop Cable
from killing that kid.

1281
01:16:40,291 --> 01:16:41,901
I'm coming up on your six.

1282
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:52,216
That gun is amazing!

1283
01:17:01,355 --> 01:17:03,401
Hey!
Asshole!

1284
01:17:03,444 --> 01:17:05,055
Where is he?
I can't see him.

1285
01:17:05,098 --> 01:17:06,839
He's on top of you.

1286
01:17:06,883 --> 01:17:08,754
He's tearing you open!

1287
01:17:08,798 --> 01:17:10,713
He's going in
through the back!

1288
01:17:10,756 --> 01:17:11,888
Oh, God, he's inside!

1289
01:17:11,931 --> 01:17:13,237
You hear yourself, right?

1290
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:14,736
Accidental double entendres!

1291
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:17,284
Russell! Russell Collins!

1292
01:17:17,328 --> 01:17:19,243
Hands off that kid,
John Connor!

1293
01:17:24,248 --> 01:17:25,249
No, no, no!

1294
01:17:29,601 --> 01:17:30,689
Shit!

1295
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:54,582
Two can play that game!

1296
01:17:56,715 --> 01:17:58,543
Got it! No, I don't.

1297
01:17:59,544 --> 01:18:00,588
Showtime, mama!

1298
01:18:00,632 --> 01:18:02,242
Lady Luck, take the wheel.

1299
01:18:40,063 --> 01:18:41,867
I'd ask who you are, but
you'll be dead in a second.

1300
01:18:41,891 --> 01:18:43,980
I'm Domino, and doubtful.

1301
01:19:00,561 --> 01:19:01,562
Hang in there, Doms!

1302
01:19:02,868 --> 01:19:04,565
Oh, this is really hard.

1303
01:19:16,839 --> 01:19:18,239
And give me back
my Skee-Ball token.

1304
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,280
You're doing great.X-Force.

1305
01:19:25,238 --> 01:19:27,284
I guess dubstep never dies.

1306
01:19:31,549 --> 01:19:32,593
Whoo!

1307
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,255
You killed Black Tom,
you racist son of a bitch!

1308
01:19:45,041 --> 01:19:46,172
That's unfortunate.

1309
01:19:49,306 --> 01:19:50,698
We got no brakes!

1310
01:19:50,742 --> 01:19:51,961
Figure it out!

1311
01:19:56,356 --> 01:19:57,880
There's nothing I can't kill.

1312
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:03,233
Well, as Scoutmaster Kevin
used to say...

1313
01:20:03,276 --> 01:20:05,626
"There's a first time
for everything, son."

1314
01:20:07,324 --> 01:20:08,891
Give me your best shot,
One-Eyed Willy.

1315
01:20:23,775 --> 01:20:25,690
Those bullets were, like,
super fast.

1316
01:20:26,256 --> 01:20:27,257
Here we go.

1317
01:20:28,345 --> 01:20:30,608
Domino, mind slowing us down?

1318
01:20:30,651 --> 01:20:32,784
Here goes nothing.

1319
01:21:03,946 --> 01:21:05,686
Knock, knock.

1320
01:21:12,215 --> 01:21:13,259
That's my boy.

1321
01:21:19,657 --> 01:21:20,876
Holy...

1322
01:21:31,103 --> 01:21:32,757
I'll be first to admit...

1323
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,151
this did not go
according to plan.

1324
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,067
I'll also be the first
to admit that

1325
01:21:38,110 --> 01:21:39,982
that plan was
written in crayon.

1326
01:21:40,025 --> 01:21:43,289
Looks like Russell found
a new friend. Jelly.

1327
01:21:43,333 --> 01:21:44,943
Turns out Domino's
a bit of a badass,

1328
01:21:44,987 --> 01:21:47,903
and maybe,
possibly mildly lucky.

1329
01:21:47,946 --> 01:21:51,210
But Cable? Ugh.
That guy's in a mood.

1330
01:21:51,254 --> 01:21:52,472
A mood that is

1331
01:21:52,516 --> 01:21:54,300
about to get
significantly worse.

1332
01:22:18,063 --> 01:22:20,500
Something is so terribly,
terribly wrong.

1333
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:24,940
Oh.

1334
01:22:26,724 --> 01:22:28,378
Oh, God, that hurt.

1335
01:22:28,421 --> 01:22:30,032
Suck it, Mel Gibson.

1336
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,688
Russell.

1337
01:22:37,387 --> 01:22:38,475
Russell!

1338
01:22:39,084 --> 01:22:41,173
Russ, where are ya?

1339
01:22:44,829 --> 01:22:47,005
Russell. Russell, you're okay!

1340
01:22:47,049 --> 01:22:50,487
Oh, thank God.
Oh, my God!

1341
01:22:50,530 --> 01:22:51,879
Juggernaut!

1342
01:22:53,055 --> 01:22:55,100
I thought that was you!

1343
01:22:55,144 --> 01:22:57,973
I should've worn
my white pants.

1344
01:22:58,016 --> 01:23:01,846
You probably get this a lot,
but I am a huge fan.

1345
01:23:01,889 --> 01:23:05,197
Uncanny X-Men183. Thor411.

1346
01:23:05,241 --> 01:23:06,590
X-Men Unlimited12.

1347
01:23:06,633 --> 01:23:08,766
You know, it has always been
a dream of mine...

1348
01:23:08,809 --> 01:23:10,594
to see my face
reflected in your helmet...

1349
01:23:10,637 --> 01:23:12,857
as you charge at me
with murderous intent.

1350
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:14,685
I don't mean right now.

1351
01:23:14,728 --> 01:23:16,643
I'm gonna rip you
in half now.

1352
01:23:16,687 --> 01:23:19,037
That is such
a Juggernaut thing to say.

1353
01:23:23,085 --> 01:23:27,132
Oh, my God!
I can't feel my legs.

1354
01:23:27,176 --> 01:23:28,264
I can't feel...

1355
01:23:29,221 --> 01:23:30,744
Oh, no, they're right here.

1356
01:23:31,571 --> 01:23:33,356
Got 'em.
God, Russell.

1357
01:23:33,399 --> 01:23:35,749
I have a mission.

1358
01:23:35,793 --> 01:23:37,360
To get my revenge.

1359
01:23:37,403 --> 01:23:39,710
I'm going to burn
that headmaster alive.

1360
01:23:39,753 --> 01:23:41,973
You're not the revenge type.

1361
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:43,540
Take it from a friend.

1362
01:23:43,583 --> 01:23:47,413
Friend? You were sick,
and I protected you.

1363
01:23:47,457 --> 01:23:49,633
You said it yourself.

1364
01:23:49,676 --> 01:23:52,375
"I'm not your friend.
Find someone stronger."

1365
01:23:52,418 --> 01:23:53,854
So I did.

1366
01:23:55,378 --> 01:23:57,554
Russell, I couldn't
protect you back then.

1367
01:23:57,597 --> 01:24:01,601
But I can now. What do you
want me to say, huh?

1368
01:24:01,645 --> 01:24:03,516
"I care about you"?
'Cause goddamn it,

1369
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:05,997
I care about you, Russell.

1370
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:08,130
What's Juggernaut got
that I don't have?

1371
01:24:08,173 --> 01:24:11,872
Don't you say legs!
I know you're gonna say legs!

1372
01:24:11,916 --> 01:24:14,701
Legs! Still hurts to hear out loud!

1373
01:24:16,877 --> 01:24:19,837
What is that?
That's not a real rope!

1374
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:22,187
You get back here, young man!

1375
01:24:23,145 --> 01:24:24,624
Doms!

1376
01:24:24,668 --> 01:24:26,887
Doms, get me
out of here, please.

1377
01:24:26,931 --> 01:24:29,325
Use my arms
as backpack straps.

1378
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:33,155
I think we may have found

1379
01:24:33,198 --> 01:24:35,374
your cosmic reason
for being here.

1380
01:24:35,418 --> 01:24:37,202
I'm pretty sure
this isn't it.

1381
01:24:37,246 --> 01:24:38,508
X-Force.

1382
01:24:52,043 --> 01:24:53,871
No child is hopeless.

1383
01:24:53,914 --> 01:24:57,396
Don't give up on the boy.
How could he just walk away?

1384
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:00,138
It was the coldness
in his eyes.

1385
01:25:00,182 --> 01:25:01,748
You should've heard it.

1386
01:25:03,663 --> 01:25:05,970
I guess family
really is an F-word.

1387
01:25:06,884 --> 01:25:09,104
Rub my legs, Mama.

1388
01:25:09,147 --> 01:25:10,540
Why would I
rub your legs?

1389
01:25:10,583 --> 01:25:13,499
Please, they hurt.
I have growing pains.

1390
01:25:16,633 --> 01:25:18,287
What in the...

1391
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:21,072
Why is your hand
so tiny again?

1392
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:22,943
That's not my hand.

1393
01:25:22,987 --> 01:25:25,337
Oh! Mary,
mother of Joseph!

1394
01:25:25,381 --> 01:25:27,296
That was nice for me.

1395
01:25:27,339 --> 01:25:30,168
Wade! I heard what happened
with the convoy and...

1396
01:25:34,607 --> 01:25:36,914
Why wouldn't you
cover that up?

1397
01:25:36,957 --> 01:25:39,177
A warrior has nothing
to be ashamed of.

1398
01:25:39,221 --> 01:25:41,179
Yeah, but you do.
Look at you.

1399
01:25:41,223 --> 01:25:43,225
You're just
straight shirt-cocking it,

1400
01:25:43,268 --> 01:25:44,748
toddler-style.

1401
01:25:44,791 --> 01:25:46,750
Oh, yeah.
Full Winnie the Pooh.

1402
01:25:46,793 --> 01:25:48,795
The hell's happening?
Describe it.

1403
01:25:48,839 --> 01:25:50,121
I wouldn't ask him to do that,
if I were you.

1404
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:51,755
It's like, um... Here we go.

1405
01:25:51,798 --> 01:25:53,080
It's like he was
giving birth anally,

1406
01:25:53,104 --> 01:25:54,627
but they quit halfway through.

1407
01:25:54,671 --> 01:25:55,822
They got the legs out,
and they said,

1408
01:25:55,846 --> 01:25:57,195
"You know what, I'm done."

1409
01:25:57,239 --> 01:25:58,501
Happy?

1410
01:25:58,544 --> 01:25:59,652
It's like he's a Muppet
from the waist down.

1411
01:25:59,676 --> 01:26:00,851
But this time, you can see

1412
01:26:00,894 --> 01:26:02,331
the Muppet's dick.

1413
01:26:02,374 --> 01:26:03,897
Grover's got a cock
the size of a twig.

1414
01:26:03,941 --> 01:26:05,136
Mr. Weasel, I can
no longer be double-parked.

1415
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,760
I've had three tickets
already.

1416
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:11,035
No, no, no, DP,
not again!

1417
01:26:11,078 --> 01:26:13,690
This has happened before?

1418
01:26:13,733 --> 01:26:15,233
Jesus! Either vomit or don't.

1419
01:26:15,257 --> 01:26:16,562
The indecision is killing me.

1420
01:26:16,606 --> 01:26:18,477
Why couldn't God
take my hearing?

1421
01:26:20,087 --> 01:26:22,264
Oh. Wow!

1422
01:26:22,307 --> 01:26:24,004
Cool your pits.
They're growing back.

1423
01:26:24,048 --> 01:26:26,006
I'm talking about your face.

1424
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:27,965
I've never seen you
without your mask before.

1425
01:26:28,008 --> 01:26:30,228
Jesus Christ! Looks like an avocado.

1426
01:26:30,272 --> 01:26:32,187
Your legs, though,
they're cute.

1427
01:26:32,230 --> 01:26:34,014
You wanna borrow
a pair of pants?

1428
01:26:35,581 --> 01:26:37,192
I'm glad everybody dropped by.

1429
01:26:37,235 --> 01:26:39,933
You must be wondering
why I didn't call you here.

1430
01:26:39,977 --> 01:26:41,587
I'll tell you why I'm here.

1431
01:26:41,631 --> 01:26:43,981
"The Time Traveler's Wife's"
husband...

1432
01:26:44,024 --> 01:26:45,263
beat me within
an inch of my life.

1433
01:26:45,287 --> 01:26:46,636
He was torturing me!

1434
01:26:46,679 --> 01:26:49,552
But all I told him was
everything he wanted to know.

1435
01:26:49,595 --> 01:26:52,250
So, I'm here
to help us gear up.

1436
01:26:52,294 --> 01:26:53,445
So we can go after him
without me.

1437
01:26:53,469 --> 01:26:54,861
No!

1438
01:26:54,905 --> 01:26:56,254
I'm doing this alone.

1439
01:26:56,298 --> 01:26:57,429
The Juggernaut

1440
01:26:57,473 --> 01:26:58,909
will kill you all. Fair enough.

1441
01:26:58,952 --> 01:27:00,843
I just need a couple of
hours to get some legs

1442
01:27:00,867 --> 01:27:01,999
under me. What will you do?

1443
01:27:02,042 --> 01:27:03,368
I don't care
what the kid did to me.

1444
01:27:03,392 --> 01:27:04,741
I ain't letting Cable
get to him,

1445
01:27:04,784 --> 01:27:06,153
even if I have to
teabag him to death.

1446
01:27:06,177 --> 01:27:08,223
It's really just a sip of tea
at this point.

1447
01:27:08,266 --> 01:27:10,050
Zip it, black Black Widow!
I'm flowing.

1448
01:27:10,094 --> 01:27:11,158
The first order
of business is

1449
01:27:11,182 --> 01:27:12,575
to get me in front of Cable...

1450
01:27:12,618 --> 01:27:14,030
so I can pull all the fucking
blood out of his body...

1451
01:27:14,054 --> 01:27:16,405
and fashion his bones
into holiday jewelry.

1452
01:27:16,448 --> 01:27:18,276
Then,
I'm gonna take his skin...

1453
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:21,366
and stretch it out
over a homemade mating drum.

1454
01:27:22,976 --> 01:27:24,576
He's standing right
behind you, isn't he?

1455
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:35,250
What in the ass?

1456
01:27:35,293 --> 01:27:38,601
Is this apartment listed
on Tinder? Grindr?

1457
01:27:38,644 --> 01:27:41,691
You picked the wrong shithole
to fuck, future boy.

1458
01:27:41,734 --> 01:27:44,259
Ugh. Is that really necessary?

1459
01:27:46,522 --> 01:27:49,307
No. It's his
"Basic Instinct."

1460
01:27:49,351 --> 01:27:51,091
What can we help you with?

1461
01:27:51,135 --> 01:27:52,789
I'm here to proposition you.

1462
01:27:54,312 --> 01:27:55,400
Oh, boy!

1463
01:27:55,444 --> 01:27:56,508
He's really teeing it up,
isn't he?

1464
01:27:56,532 --> 01:27:58,664
Who gets to make
the first joke?

1465
01:27:58,708 --> 01:28:00,076
I think we should all do it
at the same time.

1466
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:01,145
Good call.

1467
01:28:01,188 --> 01:28:02,755
For $45, you get sucky-suck.

1468
01:28:02,799 --> 01:28:04,037
I only do over
the pants, mouth stuff.

1469
01:28:04,061 --> 01:28:05,192
Fuck!

1470
01:28:05,236 --> 01:28:06,344
The Proposition
has a wonderful

1471
01:28:06,368 --> 01:28:07,673
Guy Pearce performance.

1472
01:28:07,717 --> 01:28:09,477
Wait, wait, wait!
I wanna do mine over.

1473
01:28:09,501 --> 01:28:12,112
Give us the line again. I need your help!

1474
01:28:12,156 --> 01:28:14,463
Trust me, I'm even less happy
about this than you are...

1475
01:28:14,506 --> 01:28:17,640
but you unleashed
the Juggernaut, you dumb cunt!

1476
01:28:17,683 --> 01:28:20,077
I can't bring him down alone.

1477
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:21,644
So here we are.

1478
01:28:22,993 --> 01:28:24,777
We're no longer
accepting applications

1479
01:28:24,821 --> 01:28:26,257
for X-Force, unfortunately.

1480
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:27,737
Even if we were...

1481
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:29,454
there's a wind advisory
in effect until at least...

1482
01:28:29,478 --> 01:28:30,740
We don't have a lot of time.

1483
01:28:30,783 --> 01:28:32,524
Your friend's about
to make his first kill.

1484
01:28:32,568 --> 01:28:34,091
No offense,
but if you know so much...

1485
01:28:34,134 --> 01:28:37,007
why not travel back to when
he was a baby, kill him then?

1486
01:28:37,050 --> 01:28:38,114
Or better yet, head back
a little further,

1487
01:28:38,138 --> 01:28:39,226
kill baby Hitler.

1488
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:41,228
I use a device
to slide through time.

1489
01:28:41,272 --> 01:28:43,927
The longer I travel,
the harder it is to control.

1490
01:28:43,970 --> 01:28:46,582
I got two charges:
one to get me here,

1491
01:28:46,625 --> 01:28:47,800
one to get me home.

1492
01:28:47,844 --> 01:28:49,019
Well.

1493
01:28:49,062 --> 01:28:50,977
That's just lazy writing.

1494
01:28:51,021 --> 01:28:52,303
Your boy's
gonna kill the headmaster

1495
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:53,893
of the orphanage tonight.

1496
01:28:53,937 --> 01:28:56,069
After that,
he gets a real taste for it.

1497
01:28:56,113 --> 01:28:58,855
Like 10-year-old
Kirsten Dunst, motherfucker!

1498
01:28:58,898 --> 01:29:00,900
So he keeps killing...

1499
01:29:00,944 --> 01:29:02,424
and killing, and killing,

1500
01:29:02,467 --> 01:29:03,990
and killing.

1501
01:29:04,034 --> 01:29:07,254
Until one day, he kills
the wrong fucking people.

1502
01:29:09,822 --> 01:29:11,215
My people.

1503
01:29:15,132 --> 01:29:16,394
Relax.

1504
01:29:16,438 --> 01:29:18,831
I'm retrieving something
from my utility bag.

1505
01:29:18,875 --> 01:29:21,443
It's a goddamn fanny pack...

1506
01:29:21,486 --> 01:29:24,097
and you know it,
you sick son of a bitch!

1507
01:29:24,141 --> 01:29:25,795
The difference
is night and day.

1508
01:29:27,623 --> 01:29:29,886
You remind me of my wife.

1509
01:29:29,929 --> 01:29:31,409
I'm sorry.

1510
01:29:31,453 --> 01:29:32,560
I said, "You remind me
of my wife."

1511
01:29:32,584 --> 01:29:33,944
No, I'm sorry
that you said that...

1512
01:29:33,977 --> 01:29:36,762
while making heavy eye contact
and applying lip balm.

1513
01:29:36,806 --> 01:29:37,981
She always struggled.

1514
01:29:39,112 --> 01:29:40,549
But she was funny...

1515
01:29:40,592 --> 01:29:43,943
and filtered her pain
through the prism of humor.

1516
01:29:43,987 --> 01:29:46,206
Something I could
never master.

1517
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:49,340
It was my fault she died.

1518
01:29:50,950 --> 01:29:54,606
It was my job
to stop people like him.

1519
01:29:54,650 --> 01:29:56,608
I came close a few times.

1520
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:02,484
He wasn't too happy
about that.

1521
01:30:04,224 --> 01:30:05,400
He was trying to hurt me...

1522
01:30:05,443 --> 01:30:07,402
and he knew exactly
how to do it.

1523
01:30:11,449 --> 01:30:13,146
Blessed are the wicked

1524
01:30:13,190 --> 01:30:14,757
who are healed by my hand.

1525
01:30:17,890 --> 01:30:20,240
He came into my home...

1526
01:30:20,284 --> 01:30:23,156
and took the only thing
that made it a home.

1527
01:30:27,378 --> 01:30:28,727
Sound familiar?

1528
01:30:29,772 --> 01:30:31,426
I'm sorry.Uh-huh.

1529
01:30:31,469 --> 01:30:33,123
No, I'm really sorry.

1530
01:30:35,342 --> 01:30:37,475
But that isn't Russell.

1531
01:30:37,519 --> 01:30:39,453
It doesn't have to be him.
If you knew what I knew...

1532
01:30:39,477 --> 01:30:41,479
Yeah, he's got anger issues...

1533
01:30:41,523 --> 01:30:43,089
maybe a small
learning disability...

1534
01:30:43,133 --> 01:30:44,526
splash of diabetes...

1535
01:30:44,569 --> 01:30:45,918
but nothing
that can't be fixed.

1536
01:30:45,962 --> 01:30:47,616
If you could go back...

1537
01:30:47,659 --> 01:30:50,357
and stop the people that took
your girl, would you?

1538
01:30:50,619 --> 01:30:51,881
No.

1539
01:30:51,924 --> 01:30:53,665
I'd buy them all
a bouquet of hand jobs.

1540
01:30:53,709 --> 01:30:55,450
Of course I fucking would!

1541
01:30:56,233 --> 01:30:57,364
But I wouldn't kill a kid.

1542
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:59,454
I'm not asking you
to kill a kid!

1543
01:30:59,497 --> 01:31:01,064
I'll kill the kid.

1544
01:31:01,107 --> 01:31:04,589
I'm asking you to save
hundreds of other kids.

1545
01:31:04,633 --> 01:31:06,983
Russell's gonna burn down
that orphanage.

1546
01:31:07,026 --> 01:31:09,072
And I can imagine
your dead girlfriend...

1547
01:31:09,115 --> 01:31:11,378
would want you to do
the right thing, wouldn't she?

1548
01:31:12,379 --> 01:31:15,557
So, what's it gonna be,
handsome?

1549
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,341
Give me a chance to save him.

1550
01:31:17,384 --> 01:31:18,821
What? You said...

1551
01:31:18,864 --> 01:31:20,538
once he kills someone,
he gets a taste for it.

1552
01:31:20,562 --> 01:31:22,912
If we can get to him
before that happens...

1553
01:31:22,955 --> 01:31:24,609
promise you'll give me
a chance

1554
01:31:24,653 --> 01:31:26,524
to put him
on a different path.

1555
01:31:26,568 --> 01:31:27,743
Define "chance."

1556
01:31:27,786 --> 01:31:29,024
I don't know.
How long does it take

1557
01:31:29,048 --> 01:31:30,417
to save someone's soul?
That's not...

1558
01:31:30,441 --> 01:31:31,703
I'll give you 30 seconds.

1559
01:31:31,747 --> 01:31:33,792
What? No! Best I can do.

1560
01:31:33,836 --> 01:31:35,141
Take it or leave it.

1561
01:31:45,587 --> 01:31:47,066
He's doing it!

1562
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:48,720
Look at the little fella.
He's doing it.

1563
01:31:48,764 --> 01:31:50,722
There he goes.

1564
01:31:50,766 --> 01:31:52,245
Jesus Christ!

1565
01:31:52,289 --> 01:31:53,769
Just shirt-cocking it.

1566
01:31:53,812 --> 01:31:55,727
Ugh.

1567
01:31:55,771 --> 01:31:57,131
There you go, little fella.

1568
01:31:57,860 --> 01:31:59,557
Go on, you're doing it!

1569
01:31:59,601 --> 01:32:02,473
My beautiful, hairless,
Twizzler-legged baby boy.

1570
01:32:04,649 --> 01:32:05,781
Christ!

1571
01:32:05,824 --> 01:32:07,522
That's disturbing.

1572
01:32:07,565 --> 01:32:08,958
30 seconds.

1573
01:32:14,354 --> 01:32:15,834
Deal.Deal.

1574
01:32:22,275 --> 01:32:25,365
Man, that sucks they didn't
have anything in your size.

1575
01:32:25,409 --> 01:32:27,411
I really wanted to match,
you know?

1576
01:32:27,454 --> 01:32:29,500
Being a menacing team.

1577
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:30,719
Oh, man, it sucks.

1578
01:32:30,762 --> 01:32:32,634
That was some
cold-ass shit, kid.

1579
01:32:34,026 --> 01:32:36,594
And that is just
the first five steps

1580
01:32:36,638 --> 01:32:38,335
to a prostate-assisted orgasm.

1581
01:32:39,249 --> 01:32:40,685
Where the hell
are we going?

1582
01:32:40,729 --> 01:32:42,078
You said it yourself.

1583
01:32:42,121 --> 01:32:45,037
Nothing can stop the
Juggernaut. We need backup.

1584
01:32:45,081 --> 01:32:48,040
I will bathe in the blood
of your enemies.

1585
01:32:52,175 --> 01:32:53,785
Can you turn off the music?

1586
01:32:54,786 --> 01:32:56,919
You'll do no such thing.

1587
01:32:56,962 --> 01:32:58,834
Why don't you just say it
in an Indian accent?

1588
01:32:58,877 --> 01:33:00,618
I'm sorry? Apology accepted.

1589
01:33:00,662 --> 01:33:02,751
This is a side of you
I do not like.

1590
01:33:02,794 --> 01:33:04,143
Let me guess,

1591
01:33:04,187 --> 01:33:05,686
some of your best friends
in the future are Indian.

1592
01:33:05,710 --> 01:33:06,972
What the hell are you...?

1593
01:33:07,016 --> 01:33:08,887
Once again, intolerance rears
its ugly head.

1594
01:33:08,931 --> 01:33:10,236
I am so sorry.
It gets better.

1595
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:11,847
I'm not a fucking racist,
moron!

1596
01:33:11,890 --> 01:33:13,936
That's precisely
what a racist would say.

1597
01:33:13,979 --> 01:33:15,633
I'm with the old white guy
on this one.

1598
01:33:15,677 --> 01:33:16,939
And that's a twist.

1599
01:33:16,982 --> 01:33:18,505
When this is over...

1600
01:33:18,549 --> 01:33:20,440
I'm going to fuck you to death
with your own broken feet.

1601
01:33:20,464 --> 01:33:22,640
And a sexual predator, too.
That's rich.

1602
01:33:22,684 --> 01:33:24,076
I should have
finished college.

1603
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:25,271
So what exactly do you

1604
01:33:25,295 --> 01:33:26,359
do in the future, anyway, huh?

1605
01:33:26,383 --> 01:33:27,645
Some kind of soldier?

1606
01:33:27,689 --> 01:33:29,516
Yeah, something like that.

1607
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:31,736
I was a soldier.
Special Forces.

1608
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:34,478
I bet 50 years from now,
we're bestest buddies.

1609
01:33:34,521 --> 01:33:36,523
50 years from now,
you're very dead.

1610
01:33:36,567 --> 01:33:38,961
Your entire generation fucked
this planet into a coma.

1611
01:33:39,004 --> 01:33:40,615
Boom!

1612
01:33:40,658 --> 01:33:41,920
Spoiler alert.

1613
01:33:43,139 --> 01:33:44,488
Planets.

1614
01:33:44,531 --> 01:33:46,098
Next time, Uber.

1615
01:33:46,142 --> 01:33:47,447
Here's a spoiler alert.

1616
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:50,581
You're not a fucking hero.

1617
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:54,672
You're just an annoying clown
dressed up as a sex toy.

1618
01:33:54,716 --> 01:33:55,910
Well, I got news for you.

1619
01:33:55,934 --> 01:33:57,283
My heart
is in the right place.

1620
01:33:57,327 --> 01:33:58,850
Russell's not
gonna kill anyone.

1621
01:33:58,894 --> 01:34:00,872
Because of me, he's gonna know
what real love looks like.

1622
01:34:00,896 --> 01:34:01,984
We're all going to die.

1623
01:34:02,027 --> 01:34:03,289
Because of you,
I'll always know

1624
01:34:03,333 --> 01:34:05,291
what a grown man
with baby balls looks like.

1625
01:34:05,335 --> 01:34:07,729
I'm a grower, not a shower.

1626
01:34:07,772 --> 01:34:08,947
God, I wish this were a bus

1627
01:34:08,991 --> 01:34:10,185
where I could pull
the string and get out.

1628
01:34:10,209 --> 01:34:11,863
It's a good thing
Cable's not driving,

1629
01:34:11,907 --> 01:34:13,125
or you'd be in the back.

1630
01:34:13,169 --> 01:34:15,519
- I am in the back.
- Right here!

1631
01:34:33,668 --> 01:34:35,713
I made mistakes!

1632
01:34:35,757 --> 01:34:37,454
I wanna take them back!

1633
01:34:37,497 --> 01:34:40,457
You trusted me.
I took that trust...

1634
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:41,937
and turned it
into a glory hole

1635
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:43,547
in an airport bathroom.

1636
01:34:43,590 --> 01:34:46,855
The one in Minneapolis.
You know the one.

1637
01:34:46,898 --> 01:34:49,509
But even you know I'm not
a complete piece of shit.

1638
01:34:49,553 --> 01:34:51,076
I was once an X-Man.

1639
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:52,164
Trainee!

1640
01:34:56,821 --> 01:34:59,389
You're still using
my Velcro labels. Aw.

1641
01:34:59,432 --> 01:35:01,043
They do stick better
than tape.

1642
01:35:01,086 --> 01:35:02,131
Hi, Wade!

1643
01:35:02,174 --> 01:35:03,610
Please don't.

1644
01:35:03,654 --> 01:35:06,048
Say whatever it is you're here
to say. Make it quick.

1645
01:35:06,091 --> 01:35:07,353
Right. Quick.

1646
01:35:07,397 --> 01:35:09,114
It's the kid.
Just like you, I let him down.

1647
01:35:09,138 --> 01:35:10,574
And just like me,

1648
01:35:10,617 --> 01:35:11,769
he's never had anyone
sacrifice anything for him...

1649
01:35:11,793 --> 01:35:12,813
because the whole world
wrote him off

1650
01:35:12,837 --> 01:35:14,273
as a piece of shit
a long time ago.

1651
01:35:14,317 --> 01:35:16,014
Look, he's teamed up
with the Juggernaut!

1652
01:35:16,058 --> 01:35:17,581
The Juggernaut!

1653
01:35:17,624 --> 01:35:19,385
Who's, like, my favorite
Marvel character ever...

1654
01:35:19,409 --> 01:35:21,628
And hi, Yukio! That was really
nice of you to say hi...

1655
01:35:21,672 --> 01:35:23,021
so I'm saying hi back.

1656
01:35:23,065 --> 01:35:24,457
You guys make
a super cute couple.

1657
01:35:24,501 --> 01:35:26,198
Yeah. Where was I?

1658
01:35:26,242 --> 01:35:28,113
Oh, yeah. You should never
meet your heroes...

1659
01:35:28,157 --> 01:35:29,854
because, honestly,
he's a bit of a dick!

1660
01:35:29,898 --> 01:35:31,738
And like a lot of dicks,
he's hard as a rock...

1661
01:35:31,769 --> 01:35:33,162
and causes nothing
but problems!

1662
01:35:33,205 --> 01:35:36,078
Look, you can stop the
Juggernaut. I know you can.

1663
01:35:36,121 --> 01:35:39,342
Do you know what would happen
to me if I helped you?

1664
01:35:39,385 --> 01:35:41,474
I would be disgraced.

1665
01:35:41,518 --> 01:35:43,563
You are a criminal,
a fugitive.

1666
01:35:43,607 --> 01:35:45,130
But worst of all...

1667
01:35:45,174 --> 01:35:46,915
you broke my heart, Wade.

1668
01:35:48,612 --> 01:35:49,831
Then you know what?

1669
01:35:49,874 --> 01:35:51,474
Your heart's in
the wrong place, big guy.

1670
01:35:52,529 --> 01:35:55,227
Doing the right thing
is sometimes messy...

1671
01:35:55,271 --> 01:35:58,665
and fucked up, and not
particularly convenient!

1672
01:35:58,709 --> 01:36:01,799
So stay here
in Chateau de Virgin...

1673
01:36:01,843 --> 01:36:03,975
while we go get our fuck on!

1674
01:36:07,152 --> 01:36:08,545
You're doing great.

1675
01:36:14,203 --> 01:36:15,746
So you wear
that helmet because

1676
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:17,510
your brother
tries to read your mind?

1677
01:36:17,554 --> 01:36:20,818
Yeah, but he's in
a wheelchair, so even-steven.

1678
01:36:20,862 --> 01:36:23,342
Someone's coming.
It's Russell, sir.

1679
01:36:23,386 --> 01:36:25,344
And he's not alone.

1680
01:36:25,388 --> 01:36:27,042
Secure the children.

1681
01:36:29,479 --> 01:36:32,221
They will not replace us.

1682
01:36:32,264 --> 01:36:35,050
What do you say
we go fuck some shit up?

1683
01:36:35,093 --> 01:36:38,923
"Let's fuck some shit up"
is my legal middle name.

1684
01:36:42,274 --> 01:36:44,886
Watch my back.
I've got the old man.

1685
01:36:44,929 --> 01:36:46,496
Amen, brother.

1686
01:36:53,024 --> 01:36:54,678
Time to make the chimichangas.

1687
01:36:54,721 --> 01:36:56,898
30 seconds.

1688
01:36:56,941 --> 01:36:59,465
I finally know why I'm here.

1689
01:36:59,509 --> 01:37:01,467
I was raised in this place.

1690
01:37:01,511 --> 01:37:03,774
Well, not raised.
I was tortured.

1691
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:06,690
Wow! It's your cosmic reason
for being here.

1692
01:37:06,733 --> 01:37:08,039
Shall we? This is gonna be fun.

1693
01:37:08,083 --> 01:37:09,171
Yeah!

1694
01:37:09,214 --> 01:37:10,607
Hey! Been meaning
to ask you...

1695
01:37:10,650 --> 01:37:13,915
what's with the dirty,
disgusting hobo bear?

1696
01:37:13,958 --> 01:37:17,135
It's not dirt. It's the blood
of my dead daughter.

1697
01:37:17,179 --> 01:37:19,877
Are You Bear, God?
It's Me, Margaret.

1698
01:37:19,921 --> 01:37:21,357
Give me some.

1699
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:22,967
They say
laughter heals anything...

1700
01:37:23,011 --> 01:37:24,142
except, of course, that.

1701
01:37:24,186 --> 01:37:25,404
We should just cue the music.

1702
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:53,258
Welcome home, Russell.
We missed you.

1703
01:37:54,477 --> 01:37:55,521
Russell!

1704
01:37:55,565 --> 01:37:58,960
You don't need to do this!
Let's talk!

1705
01:37:59,003 --> 01:38:00,523
Why are you dressed
like the Unabomber?

1706
01:38:04,661 --> 01:38:05,923
That's why!

1707
01:38:05,967 --> 01:38:07,292
Told you this little fucker's
too far gone.

1708
01:38:07,316 --> 01:38:09,033
Zip it, Thanos!
We have a deal and you fuck...

1709
01:38:09,057 --> 01:38:11,537
Hey!

1710
01:38:11,581 --> 01:38:14,714
I'm gonna shove that
cab driver right up your ass.

1711
01:38:15,846 --> 01:38:18,022
My body and my hands
are so soft.

1712
01:38:18,066 --> 01:38:19,304
You should probably
head back to the car.

1713
01:38:19,328 --> 01:38:21,025
I think I'll head
back to the car.

1714
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:24,899
It works best
when you pull the trigger.

1715
01:38:27,814 --> 01:38:29,077
That gun is amazing!

1716
01:38:30,426 --> 01:38:31,644
Say it!

1717
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:36,867
You are an abomination!

1718
01:38:44,135 --> 01:38:47,443
Now, I'm gonna shove
the red guy up the old guy.

1719
01:38:47,486 --> 01:38:49,924
I believe him!
Every man for themselves!

1720
01:38:54,276 --> 01:38:55,364
Gotcha!

1721
01:38:56,147 --> 01:38:57,322
Beat it, midget!

1722
01:39:00,325 --> 01:39:03,415
Hey, big guy,
the sun's getting real low!

1723
01:39:03,459 --> 01:39:04,547
Oh, shit fuck!

1724
01:39:18,430 --> 01:39:19,997
Come here, beautiful.

1725
01:39:27,787 --> 01:39:28,919
Whoo!

1726
01:39:38,102 --> 01:39:39,190
Say it!

1727
01:41:02,665 --> 01:41:03,796
You came for me.

1728
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:05,276
I'm not giving up on you,

1729
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:07,452
and you are not
giving up on that boy.

1730
01:41:07,496 --> 01:41:09,541
Who says that rules
aren't meant to be broken?

1731
01:41:09,585 --> 01:41:11,978
It's time to fight dirty.

1732
01:41:12,022 --> 01:41:13,371
Time to sweep the leg, Johnny.

1733
01:41:13,415 --> 01:41:16,200
Hey! Pick on someone
your own size!

1734
01:41:16,244 --> 01:41:18,333
That's such
a you thing to say!

1735
01:41:18,376 --> 01:41:20,335
Go get him, tiger!

1736
01:41:20,378 --> 01:41:22,250
Big CGI fight coming up!

1737
01:41:45,316 --> 01:41:46,709
He's doing great.

1738
01:41:46,752 --> 01:41:47,971
Say it!

1739
01:41:52,149 --> 01:41:53,542
- Russell.
- Bingo!

1740
01:41:58,938 --> 01:42:00,940
You see that bus?

1741
01:42:00,984 --> 01:42:02,184
I'm gonna
shove it up your ass.

1742
01:42:05,554 --> 01:42:07,512
That's right!
I'm fighting dirty!

1743
01:42:08,426 --> 01:42:09,471
Oh, great!

1744
01:42:09,514 --> 01:42:10,926
There they are!
Those freaks!

1745
01:42:10,950 --> 01:42:13,059
A bunch of armed
pedophiles in nursing shoes.

1746
01:42:13,083 --> 01:42:15,216
Can I have
one of those guns?

1747
01:42:15,259 --> 01:42:17,087
No.That's fine.

1748
01:42:17,131 --> 01:42:19,089
Get off this property,
mutant scum!

1749
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:20,293
I'm just gonna
use this brick.

1750
01:42:20,873 --> 01:42:21,961
Maximum effort.

1751
01:42:28,011 --> 01:42:29,752
Who says you
can't go home again?

1752
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:40,241
Oh!

1753
01:42:46,899 --> 01:42:47,900
Yeah!

1754
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:51,774
Say it.

1755
01:42:51,817 --> 01:42:54,864
Say what you said
every time you tortured me!

1756
01:42:55,386 --> 01:42:56,735
Say it!

1757
01:42:56,779 --> 01:42:59,477
Blessed are the wicked
who are healed by my hand!

1758
01:43:00,696 --> 01:43:02,828
Blessed are the wicked...

1759
01:43:02,872 --> 01:43:04,090
who are healed...

1760
01:43:04,569 --> 01:43:06,092
by my hand.

1761
01:43:24,154 --> 01:43:25,851
You commie motherfucker!

1762
01:43:52,922 --> 01:43:55,446
Oh, my God.
Did you feel that, too?

1763
01:43:55,490 --> 01:43:57,709
Only best buddies
execute pedophiles together.

1764
01:44:00,582 --> 01:44:02,932
You got 30 seconds,
you jabbering butt plug!

1765
01:44:02,975 --> 01:44:04,194
Now we're getting it.

1766
01:44:08,894 --> 01:44:11,157
I need a bus
to get you all out of here.

1767
01:44:16,424 --> 01:44:17,468
Orphans.

1768
01:44:18,643 --> 01:44:19,862
Oh, geez.

1769
01:44:21,298 --> 01:44:23,996
It's time to burn
for what you've done!

1770
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:26,521
A child should not be burdened
with such power!

1771
01:44:35,356 --> 01:44:36,400
Russell! Wait!

1772
01:44:42,406 --> 01:44:43,712
Oh!

1773
01:44:50,936 --> 01:44:53,069
Wait! He hasn't killed
anyone yet!

1774
01:44:53,112 --> 01:44:55,134
What more do you need to see?
Don't you fucking dare!

1775
01:44:55,158 --> 01:44:56,333
He's just a kid!

1776
01:44:56,377 --> 01:44:58,292
Tick, tock. Meter's running!

1777
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,046
I'm gonna melt you down
and make a cock ring.

1778
01:45:34,415 --> 01:45:37,069
I told you! Leave me alone! Come on!

1779
01:45:37,592 --> 01:45:38,723
Listen to me!

1780
01:46:01,964 --> 01:46:03,618
That's how we do it

1781
01:46:03,661 --> 01:46:05,141
in Mother Russia.

1782
01:46:07,361 --> 01:46:09,885
They say millennials are
the hardest to reach.

1783
01:46:11,277 --> 01:46:14,498
Oh, no.
You're doing amazing.

1784
01:46:15,804 --> 01:46:18,676
Damn, it feels good
to be a gangsta!

1785
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:20,548
Go home, Wade!

1786
01:46:20,591 --> 01:46:22,419
You're ruining everything!

1787
01:46:27,772 --> 01:46:29,121
I'm getting good at this shit.

1788
01:46:29,165 --> 01:46:30,471
Go, go, go!

1789
01:46:33,691 --> 01:46:35,650
He dies tonight, Wade.

1790
01:46:35,693 --> 01:46:38,174
You can't stop me!

1791
01:46:38,217 --> 01:46:40,089
He even runs
like a fucking pervert.

1792
01:46:40,132 --> 01:46:42,874
Like an online predator
who lost his laptop.

1793
01:46:44,310 --> 01:46:45,790
There's one bullet left
in that gun.

1794
01:46:45,834 --> 01:46:47,836
Wait, wait, wait!
Please, just give me a second!

1795
01:46:47,879 --> 01:46:49,359
I got this.

1796
01:46:49,403 --> 01:46:51,622
Russell! Stay back! Go home, Wade!

1797
01:46:51,666 --> 01:46:54,364
Let's talk. It doesn't
have to go this way!

1798
01:46:54,408 --> 01:46:56,061
That piece of shit...

1799
01:46:56,105 --> 01:46:57,846
he deserves to die
for what he did to you.

1800
01:46:57,889 --> 01:47:01,284
He hurt you badly.
Makes you wanna hurt others.

1801
01:47:02,154 --> 01:47:03,939
But if you kill him, he wins.

1802
01:47:03,982 --> 01:47:07,856
You become everything
he says you are, but worse.

1803
01:47:07,899 --> 01:47:09,901
You're just a kid.

1804
01:47:09,945 --> 01:47:11,686
You don't wanna hurt anyone.

1805
01:47:11,729 --> 01:47:12,991
How do you know what I want?

1806
01:47:13,035 --> 01:47:14,645
Because I've been inside you.

1807
01:47:15,341 --> 01:47:17,213
That came out wrong.

1808
01:47:17,256 --> 01:47:18,954
I've been inside your shoes.

1809
01:47:18,997 --> 01:47:20,869
Which is also off-putting.

1810
01:47:20,912 --> 01:47:22,392
It's not a great analogy.

1811
01:47:22,436 --> 01:47:24,263
The point is...

1812
01:47:24,307 --> 01:47:26,004
there are people...

1813
01:47:26,048 --> 01:47:29,094
There are people
in this fucking world...

1814
01:47:29,138 --> 01:47:31,836
besides him,
who will treat you right.

1815
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:34,491
It isn't too late.
Don't do it.

1816
01:47:40,062 --> 01:47:42,456
I never should've left
you there.

1817
01:47:44,196 --> 01:47:46,068
I never should've left you
in that prison.

1818
01:47:53,162 --> 01:47:54,468
I can't trust you.

1819
01:47:56,165 --> 01:47:58,515
I can't trust anybody!

1820
01:48:07,742 --> 01:48:09,004
Wonderful kid.

1821
01:48:09,047 --> 01:48:10,832
You can't stop me, Wade!

1822
01:48:13,051 --> 01:48:15,314
I got one more idea.

1823
01:48:15,358 --> 01:48:18,274
It's just a really bad one,
even for me.

1824
01:48:18,317 --> 01:48:19,580
Wade, what are you doing?

1825
01:48:19,623 --> 01:48:21,930
All right. This is for
all the marbles, kid!

1826
01:48:21,973 --> 01:48:24,062
You're gonna kill
someone today...

1827
01:48:24,106 --> 01:48:25,542
Blessed are the wicked...

1828
01:48:25,586 --> 01:48:27,501
...then it's gotta be me.

1829
01:48:28,589 --> 01:48:30,504
...who are healed by my hand!

1830
01:48:33,594 --> 01:48:36,031
Fuck this!

1831
01:49:36,744 --> 01:49:39,703
Tell me they got that
in slow motion.

1832
01:49:44,708 --> 01:49:46,231
Oh, that's not good.

1833
01:49:47,798 --> 01:49:49,234
No, sir.

1834
01:49:56,851 --> 01:49:59,767
You sacrificed yourself
for me.

1835
01:50:00,202 --> 01:50:01,377
Yeah.

1836
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:03,640
And it was the best thing
I ever did.

1837
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:07,688
I told you
I care about you.

1838
01:50:07,731 --> 01:50:09,515
You're a good kid, Russell.

1839
01:50:11,213 --> 01:50:12,301
Hey.

1840
01:50:13,607 --> 01:50:14,825
The bear.

1841
01:50:14,869 --> 01:50:16,261
It worked.

1842
01:50:23,225 --> 01:50:24,835
Because of you.

1843
01:50:24,879 --> 01:50:27,185
No, Wade, because of you.

1844
01:50:28,056 --> 01:50:30,145
Stop, stop, stop!

1845
01:50:30,188 --> 01:50:31,363
Stop!

1846
01:50:32,538 --> 01:50:35,498
Just let it happen, okay?

1847
01:50:35,541 --> 01:50:39,241
I guess my heart was finally
in the right place.

1848
01:50:39,284 --> 01:50:41,678
That riddle
is so fucked up.

1849
01:50:46,509 --> 01:50:48,903
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1850
01:50:48,946 --> 01:50:50,295
Don't be. Don't be.

1851
01:50:50,339 --> 01:50:52,558
I've been trying to make
this happen for a while.

1852
01:50:52,602 --> 01:50:54,256
Please, just don't leave me.

1853
01:50:54,299 --> 01:50:55,910
I don't wanna die
without an audience.

1854
01:50:55,953 --> 01:50:57,607
We are not going anywhere.

1855
01:50:57,651 --> 01:50:59,740
Oh, God, I hope
the Academy is watching.

1856
01:50:59,783 --> 01:51:00,915
Just rest, okay?

1857
01:51:02,743 --> 01:51:03,831
Papa.

1858
01:51:06,050 --> 01:51:08,009
♪ Papa, can you hear me? ♪

1859
01:51:10,272 --> 01:51:16,278
♪ Papa, can you find me
in the night? ♪

1860
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:39,301
Before I go...

1861
01:51:39,344 --> 01:51:41,042
Sorry, I got a bit more in me.

1862
01:51:41,651 --> 01:51:43,000
Domino.

1863
01:51:43,044 --> 01:51:47,483
I want you to have
my Adventure Timewatch.

1864
01:51:50,007 --> 01:51:52,880
Turns out
that I'm the lucky one.

1865
01:51:53,663 --> 01:51:54,751
Thank you.

1866
01:51:56,100 --> 01:51:59,364
Hey, Sabrina,
the Teenage Witch.

1867
01:51:59,408 --> 01:52:01,715
I liked you better
with your hair short.

1868
01:52:01,758 --> 01:52:02,890
Think everyone did.

1869
01:52:03,717 --> 01:52:06,458
Hi, Yukio. Hi, Wade!

1870
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:09,548
And you...

1871
01:52:10,071 --> 01:52:12,073
Chrome Bone.

1872
01:52:12,116 --> 01:52:15,032
I haven't always been
the best friend to you.

1873
01:52:15,076 --> 01:52:17,382
But you've always been
that to me.

1874
01:52:17,426 --> 01:52:18,775
So thank you.

1875
01:52:20,951 --> 01:52:22,561
Say "fuck" for me.

1876
01:52:23,388 --> 01:52:24,694
Just once. Come on,

1877
01:52:24,738 --> 01:52:26,348
we'll do it together.
It's no big deal.

1878
01:52:26,391 --> 01:52:29,438
Here we go. One, two, three.
F... F... F...

1879
01:52:29,481 --> 01:52:30,656
Fuck.

1880
01:52:30,700 --> 01:52:33,964
Wow! Enjoy hell, swamp mouth.

1881
01:52:35,313 --> 01:52:38,403
And you, Cable.

1882
01:52:38,447 --> 01:52:42,930
You get back to your family.
You tell 'em Wade says hi.

1883
01:52:42,973 --> 01:52:46,629
And promise me.
Promise me one thing.

1884
01:52:46,672 --> 01:52:48,065
That you'll start
judging people...

1885
01:52:48,109 --> 01:52:49,501
not by the color
of their skin,

1886
01:52:49,545 --> 01:52:51,416
but by the content
of their character.

1887
01:52:52,156 --> 01:52:53,767
- Jesus.
- R-Dog?

1888
01:52:54,942 --> 01:52:57,422
There you are. Hey!

1889
01:52:57,466 --> 01:52:59,685
You're a superhero now, bubba.

1890
01:52:59,729 --> 01:53:02,732
That's why it's high time
that you had a super suit.

1891
01:53:02,776 --> 01:53:04,168
This one is yours.

1892
01:53:04,212 --> 01:53:05,953
You might wanna
get it steam cleaned.

1893
01:53:05,996 --> 01:53:07,432
Especially around the pants.

1894
01:53:07,476 --> 01:53:09,173
And let it out
a little in the waist.

1895
01:53:10,131 --> 01:53:11,132
But, hey.

1896
01:53:12,176 --> 01:53:13,525
Look.

1897
01:53:13,569 --> 01:53:16,180
Family is not an F-word.

1898
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:18,269
All right?

1899
01:53:18,313 --> 01:53:20,750
There's one out there
for you.

1900
01:53:20,794 --> 01:53:22,491
Just keep looking, okay?

1901
01:53:25,973 --> 01:53:28,758
Guys, for a second there...

1902
01:53:29,585 --> 01:53:31,717
we made a pretty good team.

1903
01:53:46,776 --> 01:53:48,778
Oh, it's so hard to go.

1904
01:53:50,345 --> 01:53:52,651
I just love being around
you guys so much.

1905
01:53:53,739 --> 01:53:54,958
So, so much.

1906
01:53:55,698 --> 01:53:57,047
Mmm.

1907
01:53:57,091 --> 01:53:59,920
No, I can feel it now.
Here it comes, yeah.

1908
01:53:59,963 --> 01:54:03,793
I feel the soul
exiting the husk.

1909
01:54:03,837 --> 01:54:04,838
Yeah.

1910
01:54:06,709 --> 01:54:09,190
Can you see it?

1911
01:54:09,233 --> 01:54:11,409
Do you see
that beautiful bright light?

1912
01:54:12,889 --> 01:54:14,021
There it is.

1913
01:54:20,288 --> 01:54:21,550
Oh, that's the sun.

1914
01:54:21,593 --> 01:54:23,465
Don't stare
directly into that.

1915
01:54:23,508 --> 01:54:24,945
I just have a few final words.

1916
01:54:27,164 --> 01:54:28,557
Woodpecker.

1917
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:30,689
Gingivitis.

1918
01:54:32,735 --> 01:54:34,084
Codswallop.

1919
01:54:38,436 --> 01:54:40,395
Do You Want to
Build a Snowman?

1920
01:55:55,383 --> 01:55:56,601
Sorry I'm late.

1921
01:55:56,645 --> 01:55:58,342
There was a bunch

1922
01:55:58,386 --> 01:55:59,754
of handicapable children
who were stuck in a tree.

1923
01:55:59,778 --> 01:56:01,998
No.No.

1924
01:56:02,042 --> 01:56:05,132
But I did have to help a kid.Yeah.

1925
01:56:05,175 --> 01:56:07,090
He's got a terrible name. It's just awful.

1926
01:56:07,134 --> 01:56:08,135
Ugh. I tried to tell him.

1927
01:56:10,485 --> 01:56:11,921
Is this heaven?

1928
01:56:12,791 --> 01:56:13,967
It is now.

1929
01:56:17,448 --> 01:56:19,320
I am so sorry.

1930
01:56:20,147 --> 01:56:21,496
It's okay.

1931
01:56:41,342 --> 01:56:43,213
I missed you so much.

1932
01:56:48,827 --> 01:56:50,481
What is it? What's wrong?

1933
01:56:52,396 --> 01:56:54,485
It's not time.

1934
01:56:54,529 --> 01:56:56,531
What do you mean
it's not time?

1935
01:56:56,574 --> 01:56:58,185
I'm here, I made it.

1936
01:56:58,228 --> 01:56:59,969
You can't stay. No, no, no.

1937
01:57:00,013 --> 01:57:02,667
I'm staying. I'm not going
anywhere without you.

1938
01:57:02,711 --> 01:57:04,147
It's okay.

1939
01:57:04,191 --> 01:57:07,020
There's a time for us.
It's just not now.

1940
01:57:08,064 --> 01:57:10,501
They need you. Who?

1941
01:57:12,547 --> 01:57:13,852
Your F-word.

1942
01:57:15,115 --> 01:57:16,116
Why?

1943
01:57:16,159 --> 01:57:17,160
You'll find out.

1944
01:57:18,422 --> 01:57:19,989
It's all right. I'll be here.

1945
01:57:21,338 --> 01:57:24,124
It's pretty fucking
awesome over here.

1946
01:57:24,167 --> 01:57:26,082
I can have anything I want.

1947
01:57:26,126 --> 01:57:28,258
Can every day be
International Women's Day?

1948
01:57:28,302 --> 01:57:29,868
It is heaven.

1949
01:57:29,912 --> 01:57:31,131
I love you.

1950
01:57:33,655 --> 01:57:36,397
I know. I love you, too.

1951
01:57:37,006 --> 01:57:38,399
Now, go.

1952
01:57:39,269 --> 01:57:41,271
Go on. Go, get out of here.

1953
01:57:42,316 --> 01:57:43,317
Go.

1954
01:57:46,146 --> 01:57:47,146
Hey!

1955
01:57:50,150 --> 01:57:52,282
Kiss me
like you miss me, Red.

1956
01:57:52,935 --> 01:57:54,067
Well, come here.

1957
01:58:13,390 --> 01:58:15,131
Don't fuck Elvis.

1958
01:58:15,175 --> 01:58:16,915
Ooh, too late. I'm sorry?

1959
01:58:26,403 --> 01:58:27,665
Time to make the chimichangas.

1960
01:58:27,709 --> 01:58:28,840
30 seconds.

1961
01:58:28,884 --> 01:58:30,146
Hey. Been meaning
to ask you...

1962
01:58:30,190 --> 01:58:32,670
what's with the creepy,
dirty hobo bear?

1963
01:58:32,714 --> 01:58:34,890
It's my daughter's teddy bear.

1964
01:58:34,933 --> 01:58:36,457
Her name's Hope.

1965
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:37,632
Well...

1966
01:58:38,459 --> 01:58:40,374
What are you doing?

1967
01:58:40,417 --> 01:58:42,071
Somebody swiped right.

1968
01:58:54,823 --> 01:58:57,608
Tell me they got that
in slow motion.

1969
01:59:00,524 --> 01:59:02,309
You sacrificed
yourself for me.

1970
01:59:02,352 --> 01:59:03,875
It would seem I...

1971
01:59:06,051 --> 01:59:07,314
Huh?

1972
01:59:08,445 --> 01:59:10,795
Genuine, high-grade lead.

1973
01:59:12,710 --> 01:59:15,757
You time-sliding
son of a bitch!

1974
01:59:15,800 --> 01:59:17,367
You did this for me?

1975
01:59:19,239 --> 01:59:22,329
Wait. You can't go back.

1976
01:59:22,372 --> 01:59:23,678
You used
the last of your fuel.

1977
01:59:23,721 --> 01:59:25,462
What about your girl,
your wife?

1978
01:59:25,506 --> 01:59:28,770
Now, my family's safe.
And I didn't do it for you.

1979
01:59:30,250 --> 01:59:32,687
No, I'm gonna stick around
for a while...

1980
01:59:32,730 --> 01:59:33,992
and make sure the world

1981
01:59:34,036 --> 01:59:35,733
doesn't shit itself
into oblivion.

1982
01:59:36,430 --> 01:59:39,302
No. You did it for me.

1983
01:59:40,085 --> 01:59:41,522
No, I didn't.

1984
01:59:41,565 --> 01:59:43,001
You did. I really didn't.

1985
01:59:43,045 --> 01:59:44,885
Pretty sure you did.
No, I'm positive I didn't.

1986
01:59:44,916 --> 01:59:46,701
Fine. All right,
let's flip a coin. Okay?

1987
01:59:46,744 --> 01:59:49,486
Heads, you did it for me.
Tails, you did it for me.

1988
01:59:49,530 --> 01:59:52,315
I'm not even gonna look,
because you did it for me.

1989
01:59:52,359 --> 01:59:53,490
Say it again.

1990
01:59:53,534 --> 01:59:55,144
He did it for me. CABLE: Jesus.

1991
01:59:55,188 --> 01:59:56,991
We must get the collar off.
Forget it. It's no use.

1992
01:59:57,015 --> 01:59:58,930
These collars
don't just come off.

1993
01:59:58,974 --> 02:00:00,454
Wade.

1994
02:00:00,497 --> 02:00:02,412
I have an idea.

1995
02:00:02,456 --> 02:00:04,588
No, no, no!
Let's not do that. Please!

1996
02:00:04,632 --> 02:00:07,069
I'd rather die of cancer.
Let's just...

1997
02:00:07,112 --> 02:00:10,246
Oh, God! They do say the pen
is grosser than the sword.

1998
02:00:10,290 --> 02:00:12,596
We need the code.

1999
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:14,555
Try, uh, seven?

2000
02:00:14,598 --> 02:00:16,209
Settle down,
Captain Lucky.

2001
02:00:16,252 --> 02:00:17,688
It's not gonna be one number.

2002
02:00:17,732 --> 02:00:18,892
Oh, God, that's lazy writing.

2003
02:00:19,821 --> 02:00:21,170
I still got it.

2004
02:00:24,217 --> 02:00:26,175
Put that back
in your prison wallet.

2005
02:00:27,872 --> 02:00:29,787
I don't know how to thank you.

2006
02:00:29,831 --> 02:00:31,746
But I do know how to hug you.

2007
02:00:31,789 --> 02:00:33,095
No.Yes.

2008
02:00:33,138 --> 02:00:34,618
Here we go. Bring it in.

2009
02:00:34,662 --> 02:00:35,750
Come on.

2010
02:00:35,793 --> 02:00:37,230
Pelvis to pelvis.

2011
02:00:37,273 --> 02:00:38,622
Let's go tip to tip.

2012
02:00:38,666 --> 02:00:41,234
There we go.
The kids call this docking.

2013
02:00:42,931 --> 02:00:44,498
Is there a knife in my dick?

2014
02:00:44,541 --> 02:00:46,345
There's a knife in your dick.
I'm just gonna back up now.

2015
02:00:46,369 --> 02:00:48,284
Yeah, yeah. No need to go full Yentl.

2016
02:00:48,328 --> 02:00:51,113
Gonna pretend
like that never happened.

2017
02:00:51,156 --> 02:00:53,071
Let's go home, Russell.

2018
02:00:56,727 --> 02:00:58,512
All you dirty mutants

2019
02:00:58,555 --> 02:01:01,123
are gonna rot in hell
with the boy!

2020
02:01:01,166 --> 02:01:04,257
Your souls
are beyond redemption!

2021
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:05,562
Let's see your soul, perv!

2022
02:01:05,606 --> 02:01:08,435
No, no! No! No more!
We're better than that!

2023
02:01:08,478 --> 02:01:09,784
We're better than him!

2024
02:01:09,827 --> 02:01:12,439
No more senseless violence!
No more bloodshed!

2025
02:01:12,482 --> 02:01:14,092
We'll let karma
take care of him.

2026
02:01:14,136 --> 02:01:17,139
The day of reckoning is here!

2027
02:01:26,453 --> 02:01:28,542
I'm gonna miss him.
He seemed great.

2028
02:01:28,585 --> 02:01:29,804
Whoo!

2029
02:01:29,847 --> 02:01:31,458
Courage, motherfuckers!

2030
02:01:31,501 --> 02:01:32,981
And karma, motherfucker.

2031
02:01:33,024 --> 02:01:34,437
I could hear you
coming the last 30 seconds.

2032
02:01:34,461 --> 02:01:36,463
I could barely keep
a straight face.

2033
02:01:36,506 --> 02:01:38,421
I want some more.

2034
02:01:38,465 --> 02:01:40,205
I bet you do, Brown Panther.

2035
02:01:40,249 --> 02:01:43,774
We should leave
before Fuckernaut wakes up.

2036
02:01:43,818 --> 02:01:46,081
Good call.
You guys coming with us?

2037
02:01:46,124 --> 02:01:48,083
No, we'll get the kids
back to the mansion.

2038
02:01:48,126 --> 02:01:49,650
Besides, we're X-Men.

2039
02:01:49,693 --> 02:01:52,348
No, you're X-People.

2040
02:01:52,392 --> 02:01:53,741
You're exhausting.

2041
02:01:53,784 --> 02:01:55,569
I see what you did there.
Puns.

2042
02:01:55,612 --> 02:01:57,048
Our door's always open.

2043
02:01:57,092 --> 02:01:58,876
That's kind, but
I'm not ready to date again.

2044
02:01:58,920 --> 02:01:59,921
Let alone two women.

2045
02:02:01,052 --> 02:02:02,750
God, you're a douche.

2046
02:02:02,793 --> 02:02:04,926
Bye, Wade! Bye, Yukio!

2047
02:02:07,624 --> 02:02:08,930
What do you get

2048
02:02:08,973 --> 02:02:09,887
when you take
eight feet of chrome...

2049
02:02:09,931 --> 02:02:11,106
one pinch of courage...

2050
02:02:11,149 --> 02:02:12,368
a cup of good luck...

2051
02:02:12,412 --> 02:02:13,978
a dab of racism...

2052
02:02:14,022 --> 02:02:15,545
a splash of diabetes...

2053
02:02:15,589 --> 02:02:17,982
and a wheelbarrow
full of stage four cancer?

2054
02:02:18,026 --> 02:02:20,724
Answer: a family.

2055
02:02:20,768 --> 02:02:23,901
See? I didn't lie
what kind of film this was.

2056
02:02:23,945 --> 02:02:25,488
If there's anything
you take away today...

2057
02:02:25,512 --> 02:02:28,471
other than the need to Google,
"What the fuck is dubstep?"...

2058
02:02:28,515 --> 02:02:31,344
it's that we all need
to belong to someone.

2059
02:04:28,417 --> 02:04:30,158
How something
so small generates

2060
02:04:30,201 --> 02:04:31,768
enough energy
to reverse time is...

2061
02:04:31,812 --> 02:04:34,205
Oh, just fix it, Eleven,

2062
02:04:34,249 --> 02:04:36,512
or I'll take it
to the Genius Bar.

2063
02:04:36,556 --> 02:04:37,794
Cable's gonna kill you
when he finds out.

2064
02:04:37,818 --> 02:04:38,862
Never heard of him.

2065
02:04:38,906 --> 02:04:40,385
Why do you think
I'm helping him?

2066
02:04:41,648 --> 02:04:43,911
The Lord works
in mysterious ways,

2067
02:04:43,954 --> 02:04:46,217
don't I? A good day.

2068
02:04:46,957 --> 02:04:47,958
Bye, Wade!

2069
02:04:48,481 --> 02:04:49,482
Bye, Yukio!

2070
02:04:50,787 --> 02:04:53,311
That was probably a bad idea.

2071
02:04:53,355 --> 02:04:54,356
What have we done?

2072
02:05:12,896 --> 02:05:14,942
I hope we sharpened
the cream cheese spreader.

2073
02:05:25,082 --> 02:05:26,519
I'll be right back!

2074
02:05:28,521 --> 02:05:31,045
We're definitely naming
our kid Cher!

2075
02:05:31,436 --> 02:05:32,437
Whoo!

2076
02:05:34,265 --> 02:05:35,571
Peter!

2077
02:05:35,615 --> 02:05:37,181
Whoo! X-Force!

2078
02:05:37,225 --> 02:05:40,271
Walk away! Just walk away!

2079
02:05:40,315 --> 02:05:42,317
But we're X-Force! Nope! We're not.

2080
02:05:42,360 --> 02:05:43,710
X-Force is just
a marketing tool

2081
02:05:43,753 --> 02:05:45,059
designed by Fox executives...

2082
02:05:45,102 --> 02:05:46,800
to keep Josh Brolin employed.

2083
02:05:46,843 --> 02:05:48,366
It doesn't exist.

2084
02:05:48,410 --> 02:05:51,718
All right, well,
this has been pretty scary!

2085
02:05:51,761 --> 02:05:53,458
And I need to feed my cat!

2086
02:05:53,502 --> 02:05:55,983
Go home, Sugarbear. Go home.

2087
02:05:56,026 --> 02:05:59,290
Okay. Will you give
Domino my email?

2088
02:06:08,473 --> 02:06:10,345
Wade, is that you?

2089
02:06:12,608 --> 02:06:13,957
I guess Stryker finally

2090
02:06:14,001 --> 02:06:15,393
figured out
how to shut you up.

2091
02:06:21,965 --> 02:06:25,360
Hey! It's me!
Don't scratch!

2092
02:06:25,403 --> 02:06:27,449
Just cleaning up
the timelines!

2093
02:06:27,492 --> 02:06:31,322
Look, eventually you're
going to hang up the claws...

2094
02:06:31,366 --> 02:06:33,586
and it's gonna make
a lot of people very sad.

2095
02:06:33,977 --> 02:06:35,370
Huh?

2096
02:06:35,413 --> 02:06:36,739
But one day, your old pal
Wade's gonna ask you...

2097
02:06:36,763 --> 02:06:38,721
to get back
in the saddle again.

2098
02:06:39,635 --> 02:06:42,159
And when he does,
say yes.

2099
02:06:43,421 --> 02:06:45,380
Oh, right.

2100
02:06:46,294 --> 02:06:47,600
Love you!

2101
02:06:49,950 --> 02:06:51,604
Goddamn, that's beautiful.

2102
02:06:58,959 --> 02:07:00,787
You're welcome, Canada.

2103
02:07:13,321 --> 02:07:14,496
Boy howdy.

2104
02:07:16,367 --> 02:07:19,283
Hi. This is a toughie.

2105
02:07:19,327 --> 02:07:20,763
Yeesh.

2106
02:07:20,807 --> 02:07:24,201
Oh, yes. You're already
practicing your salute, huh?

2107
02:07:24,245 --> 02:07:27,074
Yes, you are. Well, we'll
take care of that, won't we?

2108
02:07:27,117 --> 02:07:29,903
Jesus Christ! This is
so much harder than I thought.

2109
02:07:30,730 --> 02:07:32,383
Oh, I'm going to hell.

2110
02:07:32,427 --> 02:07:34,124
That makes two of us.

2111
02:07:34,168 --> 02:07:35,778
You can do this.

2112
02:07:35,822 --> 02:07:38,476
This is crazy. This is crazy.
This is crazy. This is crazy.

2113
02:07:38,520 --> 02:07:39,652
All right.

2114
02:07:47,007 --> 02:07:49,400
Maximum effort.

2115
02:13:27,086 --> 02:13:29,392
That's okay.
Let me see here.

2116
02:13:29,436 --> 02:13:30,959
Oh, God.

2117
02:13:31,003 --> 02:13:32,961
That's why you're
such a little bastard.

2118
02:13:33,005 --> 02:13:35,355
No one's ever changed you.

2119
02:13:35,398 --> 02:13:38,140
Yeah, you got a big, old
stinky in there, don't you?

2120
02:13:38,184 --> 02:13:41,013
God, it smells like
Hitler's anus...

2121
02:13:41,056 --> 02:13:43,624
which would makes sense,
wouldn't it? Yeah.

2122
02:13:43,667 --> 02:13:44,842
I think we both know

2123
02:13:44,886 --> 02:13:46,298
I don't have
what it takes to do this...

2124
02:13:46,322 --> 02:13:48,498
so I'm just gonna change
your diaper real quick...

2125
02:13:48,542 --> 02:13:50,476
and then I'm gonna come back
with my friend, Cable.

2126
02:13:50,500 --> 02:13:51,893
He loves killing kids.
