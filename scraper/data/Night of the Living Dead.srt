1
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:57,388
<i>They are coming to get you, Barbara.</i>

2
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,723
<i>Stop it!
They are coming.</i>

3
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:07,683
They don't like being awakened this way.

4
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:11,436
Why do you have to be so mean?
Hey, I'm your older brother.

5
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,612
Being mean and heartless
is part of my job.

6
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,194
They're going
to get you, little sister.

7
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,370
Johnnie, now you're being silly
and I don't want to hear it.

8
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,914
Will you cut it out,
right now?

9
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,250
You never know
when to stop, do you? Never!

10
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,130
What's the matter, Barbara?
You gettin' scared?

11
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,211
You're still scared
of her, aren't you?

12
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,468
That's why
we're here, isn't it?

13
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:42,801
No, that's not
why we're here.

14
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,095
Tell me somethin', will ya?

15
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,648
Why do we have to put ourselves
through this... charade?

16
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,897
Because she is
our mother!

17
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:54,274
Can't you at least give her
one day out of your life?

18
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:57,231
One day? This is the fourth
time we've been up here...

19
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,442
in the three months
since she died.

20
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:03,120
I'm spending more time with her
now than when she was alive.

21
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,706
And you know why?
Don't start.

22
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,954
She couldn't possibly
be buried in the city.

23
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,082
No. That would
have been much too easy.

24
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:13,790
<i>She knew I'd have to be
the one to drive you up here.</i>

25
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:17,548
That's why she had herself buried 200
miles from the nearest glass of beer.

26
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,346
Johnnie, now we're here. Will
you just please stop it?

27
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,094
Stop what?
The truth?

28
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:26,177
She drove our father
to an early grave.

29
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,182
She drove
me away from home,

30
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:31,853
and she damned near drove you into a convent.
That's not true.

31
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,353
When's the last time you had a date?
That is none of your business!

32
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:38,690
The one thing
she never, ever drove...

33
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:41,071
was 200 miles
to visit anything.

34
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,780
Johnnie, please. Now, I need
you to stop talking like that.

35
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,036
Don't talk like that.
Not here.

36
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,083
What do you mean,
“not here”?

37
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:53,955
Not here. Not in the middle of-
Of what?

38
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:57,587
Show some respect.

39
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,636
Ha! You're afraid,
aren't you?

40
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:04,974
You really are afraid of this place.
God, you never stop!

41
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:10,771
For the love of God, Johnnie.
Bastard!

42
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:14,358
Jesus, you're weird. Let's just
get through this, can we, please?

43
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,731
Just get it over with.

44
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:20,190
They're coming
to get you, Barbara.

45
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:28,118
- Barbara-
- For the love of God, Johnnie.

46
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:35,581
They're horny, Barbara.
They've been dead a long time.

47
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:41,924
Look! Look!
There's one of them now.

48
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,304
He wants you!

49
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,509
He's getting closer.

50
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:51,975
Dangerously closer!
Stop it. John!

51
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,647
He's going to hear you!

52
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,565
It doesn't matter.
He knows we're here.

53
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:03,240
It's too late now.
There's no escape!

54
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,409
No, Mother!

55
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,954
You bastard.

56
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,119
Johnnie-

57
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,747
I'm sorry. Very sorry.

58
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,795
Hey! I'm sorry.

59
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,129
Hey, man, are you okay?

60
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,840
Is there something
we can do to help?

61
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,052
It's weird, huh?

62
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,176
Aaah.

63
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,513
- Aaah!
- Uh, uh- Oh-

64
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,735
Oh-

65
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,182
Johnnie!

66
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,518
Johnnie!

67
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,568
Help! Help!

68
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,573
Please, my brother's hurt!

69
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,933
Hey! Hey, mister! Hey!

70
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,928
Please, we need help.

71
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,888
Please, mister, help us.

72
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:37,603
Oh, sh-
No! No!

73
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,548
Hey. Hey!

74
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,676
Hey! Is there anybody here?

75
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,097
Hey!

76
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,718
Hello?

77
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,136
Hello?

78
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,932
Hello.

79
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,542
Hello?

80
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,914
Hello?

81
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,378
Hello?

82
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,126
Hello?

83
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,943
Oh, no!

84
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,001
Oh-

85
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,319
Anyone else inside?

86
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,741
Huh?

87
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,074
You got any shotguns in there?

88
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,202
Hunting rifle, anything.

89
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,125
I don't know.

90
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,328
I don't know.

91
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,547
What?
I don't-

92
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,541
You don't know?
No.

93
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:03,045
Hey. Hey.

94
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,177
Hey. Hey. Hey.

95
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,017
Hey, come on! Come on!

96
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,261
Come on!

97
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,482
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

98
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,727
Come on.

99
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,564
Come on!

100
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,737
No! Come on.

101
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,989
Come on!

102
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,989
Come on. Come on.

103
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,911
Come on!  No!

104
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,847
Die! Damn it!

105
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,670
Who is he?

106
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,251
Do you know him?

107
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,722
It's all right. it's all right.

108
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,678
Did what you had to do.

109
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,721
Do you know any of them?

110
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,767
Ones outside?

111
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,531
This isn't your house?

112
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:32,202
You don't live here?

113
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:36,282
Look. Talk to me, girl.

114
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,368
Do you have a car?
Huh?

115
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,671
Huh?

116
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:46,045
Do you have a car?

117
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,844
Yes. I- No. My brother-

118
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,679
The windows. They're not strong
enough to break through the door,

119
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,390
but they can get through
the window glass.

120
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,435
Goddamn you!

121
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:13,609
Goddamn all of you!

122
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,599
Truck's on empty.

123
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,938
We can't take the chance of running
dry out in the middle of nowhere.

124
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,312
We'll hole up here.

125
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,318
Hope that some help comes.

126
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,083
My name is Ben.
What's your name?

127
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,834
- Barbara.
- Barbara.

128
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,468
- Yes.
- Now look here, Barbara.

129
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:02,138
I don't need you falling apart on me.
You understand?

130
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:06,058
I see what you did over there. I
know you can fight when you have to.

131
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,432
Well, you have to now.
Right now.

132
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,264
Fight what you're thinkin'.
Fight what you're feelin'.

133
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,566
The fight'll keep you strong,
keep you thinkin' straight.

134
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,109
What's happening?

135
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,690
I don't know.

136
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,736
Nobody knows.

137
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,210
Radio in the truck.

138
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:22,669
All I heard was trash talk.

139
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,720
Same as always.

140
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,014
People tryin' to sound
like they know what's goin' on.

141
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,012
They don't really know shit!

142
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,639
Same as always.

143
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,891
One guy saying it's...

144
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,234
escaped prisoners on the loose
from up at Hennessey.

145
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,861
Another guy saying it's...

146
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:48,320
some kind of chemical spill
makin' everybody go crazy.

147
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,914
They don't know shit.

148
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,427
How do they explain...

149
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,256
a man walkin' around
with his neck broken?

150
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,601
A man shot full of holes...

151
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,850
and still comin' at you?

152
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,319
Assholes... down in Evans City
out for a good time...

153
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,693
with their guns
and their six-packs.

154
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:31,238
Assholes tryin' to round them up
and put them in the back of trucks.

155
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,913
Like they know what
they going to do with them.

156
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:43,708
They had 10, 20 of them
in the back of this panel truck.

157
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,254
They opened the door
to let another one in.

158
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,553
They come spillin' out of there...

159
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,093
like bugs.

160
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,292
I was at a diner.

161
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,042
Windows shot out.

162
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,178
Lady next to me shot dead.

163
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,509
Others too.

164
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,819
I saw six or seven go down.

165
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,619
Car exploded outside.

166
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,657
My car caught on fire.

167
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:45,168
It was like- like a war.

168
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:52,345
Some of those things
made it inside the diner.

169
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,677
Started comin' after us.

170
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:59,602
Some good ol'
boy comes chasin' him.

171
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,476
Mean son of a bitch
got some kind of...

172
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,853
hot-shit gun,
like an M-16 or somethin'.

173
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:09,063
He starts-
shooting wild.

174
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:12,615
Bullets tearin' up the place.

175
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:17,787
I saw one of those things
take 30 hits and keep on comin'.

176
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:21,161
The damn thing had to be dead,
but it kept on comin'...

177
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,368
till it took a hit in the head.

178
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,538
That brought it down.

179
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,299
The only way to stop 'em-
You got to-

180
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,876
You got to...

181
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,050
get 'em in the head.

182
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,970
Look, I don't know what's goin' on,

183
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,722
but I sure as hell know
that it ain't no prison break.

184
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:44,226
It ain't no kind of chemical that I ever
heard about can make a dead man walk.

185
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:51,233
This is something that nobody has ever
heard about and nobody's ever seen before.

186
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,699
This is hell on earth.

187
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:01,372
This is pure hell on earth.

188
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,265
Damn!

189
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:32,980
Doesn't take long for the world
to fall apart, does it?

190
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,133
There's got to be guns
in this house.

191
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,146
Maybe upstairs.

192
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,773
I'm going to go
take a look around.

193
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,446
You all right down here alone?

194
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,656
There's something up there.
What?

195
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,822
What is it?

196
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:04,403
It's all right.

197
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,122
It's nothin' to worry about.

198
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:12,044
- What is it?
- It's nothin'. It's nothin'.
It's all right.

199
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,261
Ben!

200
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,392
It's all right. Don't shoot.
Don't shoot, mister!

201
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:11,641
- It's just us!
- Who the hell is “us"?
- Tom Bitner, sir. That's me.

202
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,185
Harry, what's going on?
This here's Harry Cooper.

203
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:16,608
That's his wife callin'
down in the cellar.

204
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,857
They got a sick little girl
down there too.

205
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,439
My woman's down there too,
that's Judy Rose Larson.

206
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,774
Um, that's all of us.

207
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,780
Do you mind if we ask
who the hell you are now?

208
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:30,035
- Girl's Barbara. I'm Ben.
- You damned near broke my arm, Mr. Ben.

209
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,036
Harry, for God's sake!

210
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,744
- Aren't you going to answer her?
- Harry, please answer me!

211
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,829
Uh, it's all right.
We're all right.

212
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:40,758
- There's some people up here.
- Didn't you hear all the noise up here?

213
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,391
We could've used some help.

214
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:45,454
Hey, maybe you can see through walls.
I can't.

215
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,005
We heard some
bangin' around up here.

216
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,262
It could've been those things
for all we could tell.

217
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,310
We just heard
some bangin' around is all.

218
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,307
No, no, that ain't right.

219
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,607
We heard the girl callin' out,
askin' if anyone was here.

220
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,560
We was just scared, that's all.
Want to know the truth?

221
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:01,521
We was scared to hell.

222
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,736
You live here, Tom?

223
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:11,991
No. This is my Uncle Rege's house.

224
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,825
Him and my cousin Satchel.

225
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:15,914
Ol' Uncle Rege, he's dead.

226
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,745
I seen him. I swear to God.
I touched him.

227
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,455
He was stone cold dead.
He died today.

228
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,415
- And that's the truth!
- Harry, please!

229
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,839
Let's go. We can talk in the cellar.
Me and Judy Rose,

230
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,762
we walked on over to be
with Satchel, you know?

231
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,886
Radio said there was some kind of trouble.
We didn't see nothin'.

232
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:31,934
We didn't see nothin'. Home to
here, we didn't see nothin'.

233
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,887
Damn it!
We have heard all this before!

234
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:37,770
I didn't hear it before, Cooper.

235
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,941
Go on, Tom.

236
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:43,521
Well, me and Judy Rose,
we walked on over like we said.

237
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,777
We wasn't here more than 10
minutes when Mr. Cooper there,

238
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,778
he come bangin' on the door.

239
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,782
How'd you get here?
You don't look like neighbors.

240
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,113
Oh, what? You tryin' to figure
out if somebody's got a car?

241
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,119
You don't think we've
all been through this before?

242
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,951
Mine is broken down
on the interstate,

243
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,412
and the kid here doesn't own one,
if you can believe that.

244
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:01,789
Damn!
What about you, Mr. Ben?

245
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,716
You don't exactly look
like neighbors yourself.

246
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:09,630
Truck- outside, out of gas. Gas?

247
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:14,014
Evans City is five miles away.
Hey, we can make five miles on freakin' fumes!

248
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:16,015
Yeah, what if
we don't make it?

249
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,813
You willin' to take that chance?

250
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,685
Besides,
Evans City's a war zone, man.

251
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,358
I know. I been there.

252
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:25,734
It's going to take us a hell of a lot more
than five miles before we find any real help.

253
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:28,198
There's a gas pump out by the shed.
Huh?

254
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:30,822
But Uncle Rege,
he keeps it locked.

255
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,994
Do you know where the key is?

256
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:36,199
No, but I could hunt for it.

257
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:40,127
We will, but not now.
It could take too long.

258
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:43,001
Besides, we might never find it.

259
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,049
We got to figure out
what we're doin' first!

260
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:49,049
- Finish your story, Tom.
- This is bullshit.

261
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,255
If we're going to do something,
let's do it.

262
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,967
If we're going to stand around and
bullshit, let's do it in the cellar...

263
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:57,640
where it's safe. I'm not so sure goin'
down in that cellar is a smart move.

264
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,684
What do you mean?
I mean I'm not so sure...

265
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:02,233
lookin' ourselves down in that
cellar is such a smart move!

266
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,731
I'm not goin' down there until
I know what all the options are.

267
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,903
What damned options?

268
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,028
And who the fuck gave you the right
to decide for the rest of us?

269
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,530
I'm not deciding for you
or anybody else, Cooper.

270
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:15,989
I'm thinkin' about my own ass!
Now, you want to go down in that cellar, go!

271
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:19,037
Nobody's stoppin' you.
For God sakes, Harry, what's going on?

272
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,869
Damn it, Helen!
Will you quit yelling at me?

273
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,079
I can't think straight
with you yelling at me!

274
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:27,383
You know, I've only been
around you a minute or two,

275
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:30,052
but that's enough time for me
to know that I don't like you.

276
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,425
I'm sure you feel the same
about me, so let's just...

277
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:34,974
try to stay out of each
other's way, all right?

278
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,975
Go on, Tom.
What else you got to tell?

279
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:46,231
Well, like I said,

280
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:50,736
Judy Rose and I, we wasn't here
more than 10 minutes, and...

281
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:53,113
Mr. Cooper, he come bangin'
on the door, you know.

282
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:55,410
We let him in,
him and his wife,

283
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:57,454
and I seen
their little girl was hurt,

284
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,077
so I, uh-

285
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,124
I tried to call for help, you know.

286
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:03,122
The phone's makin' this funny sound.

287
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,623
Tried and tried,
and I couldn't call nobody.

288
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,798
That's when Uncle Rege, uh,

289
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,298
he come walkin' out
of the bedroom, you know?

290
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:14,847
He was dead a minute before.
I swear to God.

291
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,221
<i>He was not dead.
He couldn't have been.</i>

292
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:21,645
Y-You were wrong.
You made a mistake. That's all.

293
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,650
He was dead.
I know he was.

294
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,853
What happened?

295
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:33,691
Uncle Rege, he went
after my cousin Satchel.

296
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,449
H-He- He went
after him like, uh-

297
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,494
I don't know.

298
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,875
Anybody else in the house?

299
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,536
No, just them.

300
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:53,636
Tom, I'm afraid
your cousin is dead.

301
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:58,137
Uh-huh. I know he's dead.

302
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,716
Shot himself.

303
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:04,097
I mean, Uncle Rege comin'
after him and all, you know?

304
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:06,307
I run down here and got the
shotgun, but what could I do?

305
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,358
I couldn't imagine
shootin' Uncle Rege.

306
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:13,527
Couldn't imagine
doin' a thing like that.

307
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:16,154
And that's when I told everyone
to go down in the cellar.

308
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,236
Goin' down in the cellar,
that's my idea.

309
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:22,744
- It was a good idea.
- Look. Look outside.

310
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:36,675
- Into the cellar, quick.
- No, that cellar's a death trap.

311
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,381
Those things don't have much strength,

312
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:41,012
but get enough together. they may
be able to break through the door.

313
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,684
Be cornered down there.
No way out.

314
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:45,729
We'd do better fightin' 'em off here
where there's still some way to escape.

315
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,807
A way out is a way in.
T-The windows-

316
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,901
Maybe we can board 'em up.
There's no time.

317
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,396
Those things are- Look, there's
only three of them, man.

318
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,857
I've handled more than that by myself.
We found these two guns.

319
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,363
I'm worried about more of 'em comin'.
That cellar door won't hold 'em.

320
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,696
- Oh, and the windows will.
- Look, I don't need this!

321
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:05,408
I told you before, you want
to go downstairs, go on. Get!

322
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:08,244
You can be boss down there.
I'm boss up here.

323
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,454
What you going
to do, Tom?

324
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:19,506
Judy Rose, come on up.
We need your help.

325
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,591
You're crazy!
You're out of your minds.

326
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:24,518
This here's Judy Rose.

327
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:27,138
Go get them old shelves out of the kitchen.
What are we doin' now?

328
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:31,438
We're going to board up them windows.
Tommy!

329
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:34,236
Board up the windows? Are you
sure we're going to be all right?

330
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,360
There are more of them things out there.
More of them things like Uncle Rege.

331
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,359
Tommy!
Go on. Do what I tell ya!

332
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:50,123
I shut this door, I'm not openin' it until
somebody comes who can get us out of here.

333
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:54,252
If somebody like that comes,
we'll try to remember to call you.

334
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,676
Idiots! You lamebrains!

335
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,467
You're going to die up here.

336
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:04,558
You're going to die.

337
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:21,946
You're going to be fine.
We're all going to be fine.

338
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:25,029
Daddy's found someone,
and we're going to get some help.

339
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,659
What's happening? They
decided to stay upstairs.

340
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:33,537
What about us?
it's safer down here.

341
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:37,045
- What about Sarah?
- It's safer down here, Helen.

342
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,968
There's just that one hammer.

343
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:47,222
Here. Use this.
Nail 'em up quick and dirty.

344
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,974
Get the windows covered
as fast as you can.

345
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,306
We'll go around later
and reinforce them.

346
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,358
Anybody find any keys,
hang on to 'em.

347
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:58,605
How many people are up there?
There's two more.

348
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,656
- And they've got the gun.
- No, they've got two guns.

349
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:04,656
They might have a hundred
guns, for all I know.

350
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:09,035
But it doesn't matter,
because it's safer down here!

351
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,537
We're going up.
We've got to get help for Sarah.

352
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:13,744
I'm not opening that door,
Helen, and neither are you.

353
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,839
And if you try, so help me I'll kill you.
You'll what?

354
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:20,543
That is your daughter lying there.

355
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:22,753
We have got to
get her to a doctor!

356
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,758
There's no doctors
upstairs, Helen.

357
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,887
And there's
no way out of here!

358
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:32,187
None of those yo-yos has a car!

359
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,937
What a place to be stuck!

360
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,985
Middle of nowhere.
Bunch of yo-yos.

361
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:41,154
Judy Rose, help me here!

362
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:45,241
That's it. Grab this. Perfect.
Fever's gotten worse.

363
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:50,159
Look, she's going
to be all right.

364
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,787
Somebody'll come.
We'll get out of here.

365
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,837
We're all going to be all right.

366
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,005
Did you find anything?

367
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:01,626
I'm done over here.
They're crazy.

368
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,802
They're out of their minds.

369
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,175
You bunch of yo-yos!

370
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:19,815
This is the last of the big stuff, huh?
Not going to do it.

371
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,487
Hey, Tom, give me a hand.

372
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,410
Turn it over.
Come on. Come on.

373
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:39,872
Get the legs off. Shit!

374
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,763
All right. We'll leave our gun here.

375
00:37:43,789 --> 00:37:45,778
I'll be back.
Come on, come on, come on!

376
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,838
Get over here.

377
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:55,346
Okay, great.
Bring my gun when you come back.

378
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,024
Come on. Nail it up.

379
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:08,613
Just get it up.
We'll reinforce it later.

380
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,111
They're so slow!

381
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:17,167
We could just walk right past 'em.
We wouldn't even have to run.

382
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,120
We could just walk
right past 'em.

383
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:24,124
We have the guns.

384
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,426
If we're careful,
we can get away.

385
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,471
You told me to fight.

386
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:32,640
Well, I'm fighting.
I'm not panicking.

387
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:36,641
This place is not safe,
not upstairs or down.

388
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,895
We should leave
before it's too late.

389
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,022
Look, I know you want
to get out of here,

390
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:46,070
and so do I,
and we're going to do it.

391
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,320
We're going to figure out a way to
get to that gas, and we'll be gone.

392
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,027
Now, you're doin' fine, all right?
I'm doin' fine.

393
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,283
We're all doin' just fine.

394
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:57,036
We're going to make it,
if we're careful.

395
00:38:57,126 --> 00:39:00,118
Like you said,
we've got to be careful.

396
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:04,499
Get them doors down and nail 'em up!
That's it! Nice goin'!

397
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,840
Is she crazy or what?

398
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:15,934
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

399
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,387
Tommy!
Easy- Easy.

400
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:24,564
Wait for Tom. Wait.

401
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,645
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
All right. Nail it up.

402
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:30,194
Nail it up! Come on. Come on.

403
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:32,196
Just get a few nails in.

404
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,198
Okay. Get some in the table top.
All right?

405
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:28,628
It's all right. Come on.
Keep nailing. Keep pounding.

406
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:32,302
Get a hole for that one. Come on, Tom.
Tom! Oh, yeah, another door.

407
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:37,303
Let's get this baby off.

408
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:40,602
That's good.

409
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,146
Easy, easy, easy.
All right.

410
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,553
Hit it.
Come on!

411
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:19,641
Hey, we're goin'
upstairs for a minute.

412
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,014
We're going to leave
the weapons here, all right?

413
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:28,229
Hey, hey, Tom. Tom.
Wait a minute.

414
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,538
Wait a minute.
Don't go up.

415
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:57,971
It's all right.
Come on. Don't look at it.

416
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:26,579
What is this?
All new stuff in here?

417
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,630
Uncle Rege was
fixin' up the place.

418
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,299
- No good.
- it's better than nothin', Ben.

419
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:39,383
No good.

420
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,147
Hey, Tom.
Television.

421
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,979
Check it out and see
if anything's on.

422
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,038
Tellin' you what to do,
I think.

423
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:19,253
Damn. This must really be big.

424
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:26,344
Station's in Zelienople.
it's only about 20 miles from here.

425
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:29,099
Might as well be a hundred.

426
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,608
- Says they're going to come on live.
- Yeah? Well, we can't wait.

427
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,860
Give me a hand with some
of that lumber over there.

428
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:43,740
We can use some of this stuff
to cover the windows downstairs.

429
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,115
I'm some kind of stupid.
What?

430
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:52,669
Them old doors, the ones we took
down, they're all in the cellar.

431
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,048
Heads up down there!

432
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,806
- Idiots!
- What's happening up there?

433
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:12,981
How do I know what's
happening up there?

434
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,525
Said they were going
to board it up.

435
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,694
- Board it up, please.
- And you refused to help them.

436
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,738
That's right, Helen.
I refused.

437
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:23,738
Right! I refused.
You know why?

438
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:25,990
Because they're wrong.
it's a stupid idea.

439
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,913
The cellar is the only
safe place in the house.

440
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,991
You watch.
You just watch.

441
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:35,454
They're going to come begging for us to let
them in down here before this is all over.

442
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,835
And what will you do then?

443
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:41,293
- Will you open the door then?
- Mr. Cooper?

444
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:44,012
Harry.

445
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:47,557
Mr. Cooper, we need the doors that's down
there so we can board up the windows.

446
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:52,763
- For God's sakes, Harry!
- Then fuck him!

447
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:55,098
Mr. Cooper,
can you hear me?

448
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:59,190
Cooper! You open
this door right now!

449
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,523
We need those doors,
Cooper!

450
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:11,031
I got a shotgun out here. Open this door,
motherfucker, or I'll blow it to shit!

451
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,742
What are you doing? Cooper
Open this door, now!

452
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:16,745
What do you hope to accomplish?
Shut up, Helen!

453
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:20,377
I'm counting to three,
then I'm coming through.

454
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:22,379
We're going to open!

455
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,682
I'm counting.
That's one-

456
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:40,352
What you going to do, Cooper?
That's two!

457
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:43,313
Better open this door
right now, Cooper!

458
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,632
Get your hands off of me.

459
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:07,087
Look. From now on,
you leave that door open!

460
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:10,424
We may want to get down there. We may need
to get down there if those things break in.

461
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:13,476
Yeah, sure. You want
the best of both worlds.

462
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,849
You get caged in up here, you want
to be able to run downstairs.

463
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,022
That's not the way
it's workin', pal.

464
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:21,272
You want to get in that cellar, you get
in there now or you can forget it!

465
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:24,855
I'm not boxin' myself in down there until
there's absolutely no other choice.

466
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:27,281
And I'm not gamblin'
with my daughter's life!

467
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:31,987
You want to stay up here, that's your
decision, but don't count on me to help you.

468
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:35,290
Look, I am not counting on you for shit.
That's why I'm not going to let you-

469
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:37,834
If you're going to keep on
fighting, then get out!

470
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,213
This is our house.
This is Tommy's house.

471
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:42,530
You're just all playin'
rooster with it.

472
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:46,835
I'd like to know where you'd all
be if we didn't let you in here.

473
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:49,546
Where would you be
if we kicked you the hell out?

474
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,224
We're not going to kick anyone out, Judy Rose.
We're not going to do anything like that.

475
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:57,270
Now, come on. Let's try to work together
and get some of this damn shit done!

476
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,340
You ought to keep her covered.

477
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,760
Get some blankets
from upstairs or somethin'.

478
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:03,419
How'd she get hurt?

479
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:06,874
One of those people
bit her on the arm.

480
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:21,270
What? You want
this one too?

481
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:33,446
We have to get help.
We have to get a doctor for Sarah.

482
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:35,903
We're going to try.

483
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:40,661
Since you ain't doin' nothin', maybe you
want to start lookin' for those keys.

484
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:48,506
What keys? Keys to the
gas pump out back.

485
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:52,093
You mean, there's a car?
It's a truck!

486
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,637
The gas pump
is locked.

487
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:57,010
The keys could
be anywhere!

488
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:07,017
You know where- keys- I'm-

489
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:10,194
I'm looking for-
Oh, my God.

490
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,865
Oh, my God.

491
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,194
Oh, my God.

492
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,724
I need the hammer in here.

493
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,021
Bring the hammer-

494
00:49:57,077 --> 00:50:00,035
Tommy!

495
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:14,547
Tommy!
Tommy!

496
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:18,255
Helen, we ought
to get downstairs quickly!

497
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:26,725
Damn.

498
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:32,523
Cooper, get me them nails
over there and that wrench!

499
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:33,237
Helen!

500
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:35,756
I can't let go.
You got to help me out.

501
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:39,029
Get me the wrench and nails, man!
Helen!

502
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,530
Cooper!

503
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:57,964
This is definitely not going to work.

504
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,977
We've got to get
downstairs quickly.

505
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,820
Take your hands off of me.
Take your hands-

506
00:51:08,846 --> 00:51:10,002
Take your hands off of me!

507
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,978
Damn it!

508
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,078
No!

509
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:28,749
No, don't shoot it.
It's Mr. Magruder from the Legion Hall.

510
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:30,608
You shot Mr. Magruder!

511
00:51:30,634 --> 00:51:33,856
Look at his back.
- You shot him!

512
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,962
Look at his back. I didn't do that.
Look there.

513
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:40,386
Barbara.

514
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:43,009
Just like Uncle Rege. They're dead,
but they're coming right for us.

515
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,263
No. That's impossible.

516
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,936
That just can't be.

517
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:52,186
Grab him. We'll throw him
up and out the window.

518
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,317
Is he dead?

519
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:09,616
Is he dead? You're all seeing this.
Is he dead?

520
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:12,748
Stop it! You're losing it, girl.

521
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:15,956
You are losing it!

522
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,961
You think so?

523
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:25,465
Whatever I lost,
I lost along time ago.

524
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,550
And I do not plan on
losing anything else.

525
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:30,387
You can talk
to me about losing it...

526
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:34,190
when you stop screaming at each other
like a bunch of two-year-olds.

527
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:48,496
You all right?
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

528
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,493
You all right?
Look at me.

529
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,996
It's going to be all right, okay?

530
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:55,704
How many bullets
does this thing hold?

531
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:58,756
Fifteen. There's more in the desk.

532
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:06,673
Look, we have a few more
windows to cover up, all right?

533
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:09,099
Why don't you grab some of that
lumber over there and get started.

534
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:11,765
It's going to take us a while.
Okay?

535
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:17,897
Tommy. Tommy.

536
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,604
<i>Hospitals are deluged</i>

537
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:10,071
<i>Random acts of violence are being committed
by people in a trance-like or hypnotic state.</i>

538
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:14,203
<i>They've lost their ability to communicate
and reason, and they do not respond...</i>

539
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:16,625
<i>to command or authority.</i>

540
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:20,671
<i>Civil forces and the military have been
mobilized but the violence is so widespread...</i>

541
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:25,093
<i>that it is impossible for rescue
services to respond with any efficiency.</i>

542
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:28,843
<i>People left to defend themselves are
caught in a river of...</i>

543
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:41,521
<i>Citizens faced with the collapse of
local police and fire departments...</i>

544
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:44,104
<i>have taken the law
into their own hands.</i>

545
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:47,190
<i>Civil and social services have
been disrupted or suspended</i>

546
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,241
<i>Most communities
are without telephones.</i>

547
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:53,822
<i>Many are without power,"
some are without gas and water</i>

548
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:56,783
<i>The scientific community
is focusing on the phenomenon.</i>

549
00:54:56,877 --> 00:55:02,293
<i>Specifically, on that trance-like state
that seems to characterize the assailants-</i>

550
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:05,545
<i>clearly a behavioral disorder.
But what could have caused...</i>

551
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:09,470
<i>so widespread and dramatic a condition
as the one we are facing tonight?</i>

552
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:13,515
<i>We've heard speculation on everything from
the ozone layer and chemical weapons...</i>

553
00:55:13,602 --> 00:55:16,264
<i>to, uh,</i>

554
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:20,474
<i>voodoo, mysticism and organisms from space.</i>

555
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:23,104
<i>Biologists in Stockton, California,
have released a report...</i>

556
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:25,311
<i>stating that the, uh,</i>

557
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:28,989
<i>bodies of
the recently dead are...</i>

558
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:30,908
<i>returning to life,</i>

559
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:37,157
<i>driven by an unknown force that enables
the brain to continue to function.</i>

560
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:46,167
<i>Doctors at the Center for Disease
Control in Atlanta reject that theory,</i>

561
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,877
<i>calling it "preposterous

562
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:52,009
<i>They feel that the only
reasonable explanation...</i>

563
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:54,716
<i>is a germ- uh, a bacteria
or a virus that has...</i>

564
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:57,518
<i>a mind-altering effect
on its victims,</i>

565
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:01,017
<i>though how such a germ could have
been delivered so quickly...</i>

566
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:04,442
<i>and over such a vast area
does remain a mystery.</i>

567

<i>It's being called "Judgment Day"

568
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:55,489
Hey, man. Where you takin' that? Huh?
What the hell-

569
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:58,363
That stays up there, pal. Will
you get off my back, Goddamn it!

570
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:01,035
Damn it!

571
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:05,328
Damn it! Nice going, asshole!
You smashed it!

572
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:08,252
You were taking it downstairs!
I was not!

573
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:11,171
You stupid-
You fuck-

574
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:15,050
Damn you!
I'll kill you.

575
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:17,139
You son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!

576
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:20,434
That was our only way
of finding out what was going on,

577
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,012
and you smashed it!

578
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:25,768
I wasn't taking it downstairs!

579
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:29,693
You can't get any reception
in a basement, dickhead!

580
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,148
What the hell
is she doin'? Hey!

581
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:45,034
Is that your Uncle Rege?
Looks like him.

582
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,665
Do you think he might have
a set of keys in his pocket?

583
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:08,562
We've got to get the keys.
Damn it, stay back here!

584
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:38,086
We can get away.

585
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:41,678
No, it's too dangerous.

586
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:44,009
I'm telling you,
we could make it!

587
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:46,766
Five miles. We got that kid.
Cooper's kid.

588
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:49,474
- Leave him. We'll bring help.
- We better make some kind of damn move.

589
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:52,067
We're drawing a crowd here.

590
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:03,286
You know I'm right.

591
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:07,037
Like I told you,
we can walk right by them.

592
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:10,461
I got 'em. I got the keys.

593
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:15,708
We got to get to the gas.
It's our best chance.

594
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,464
All right. Everybody,
back inside quick!

595
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:26,515
Damn it! Get in here!

596
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,563
I want you to stay inside. What?

597
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,978
Keep the rifle. You can't
go out without the guns.

598
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:16,982
We have Tom's gun. If something
happens, I want that rifle in here.

599
01:00:17,072 --> 01:00:21,111
- I don't want any locked doors between me and this guy.
- Oh, for crying out loud.

600
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:21,899
Do you think that-

601
01:00:21,925 --> 01:00:23,843
- Shut up, Cooper.
I don't want to hear another word.

602
01:00:23,912 --> 01:00:27,371
The only way I'm going out there is with
you and that rifle keepin' things straight.

603
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,289
Tom, let's go.
it's you and me.

604
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,036
I'm coming with you.
I can drive.

605
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:36,083
No, you're staying here.
Somebody's gotta drive,

606
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:38,506
somebody's got to do the gas, and
somebody's gotta ride shotgun.

607
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:43,759
That means three of us goes out. Tommy,
tell them I know how to drive. I can do it!

608
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:46,341
Her daddy's got trucks. She's been
driving since she was little.

609
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:50,894
All right. Is that shotgun loaded?

610
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:52,847
Yeah, I got shells in my pocket.

611
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:58,985
Can't tell how many
are on the porch.

612
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,029
Probably be the toughest
getting past those.

613
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:04,154
Once we get to the yard, we oughta be all right.
Not too many out there.

614
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,825
There's no way.
This is crazy.

615
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:13,534
We're never going
to make it.

616
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:14,993
Hah!

617
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:33,558
You keep an eye
on us outside.

618
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:36,766
When we get that gas and start driving
back, get that kid up there fast.

619
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,726
Judy, get in that truck, all right?

620
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,312
Get in; get it started.
Don't stop, no matter what happens.

621
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:43,898
Tom and I will keep those things off of you.
You just move!

622
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:52,781
Heads up!

623
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:58,499
Go! Come on!
Get in the truck!

624
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:03,797
Get in!

625
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:13,052
No! Oh, God!

626
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,137
Oh, God!

627
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,573
Damn it!

628
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:02,192
Shut the door!
Shut the door!

629
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:05,271
Darn you piece of shit!
Start!

630
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:34,599
Come on! Come on! Wait! Wait!

631
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:38,053
Ben, come on!

632
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,557
What's happening?

633
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:50,900
Ben!

634
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:53,326
Judy Rose, slow down!
We lost Ben!

635
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:57,748
Judy Rose, stop!
Stop the car!

636
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,075
We lost Ben!
Go back!

637
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:02,081
Judy!

638
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:05,873
Ben!

639
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:13,385
We lost Ben!
What?

640
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:16,178
We lost Ben! Oh, my God.
Why didn't you tell me?

641
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:19,557
I was hollering at you!
Go back and pick him up!

642
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:28,362
Tommy, here he comes! What should I do?
I don't wanna leave you!

643
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:31,440
Go down there
and get him, Judy Rose!

644
01:04:33,745 --> 01:04:35,986
- These are the wrong keys!
- What?

645
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:39,581
These are the wrong damn keys!

646
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:42,375
Tom! What the hell
are you doing?

647
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:04,393
I want you down
in that cellar, Helen!

648
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:06,771
There's nothing more we can do up here.
Not now.

649
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:09,444
Do what he says. We're
gonna try to get to town.

650
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:13,195
At least I am. I f I can find
any help, I'll be back.

651
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:15,195
Come on.

652
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:17,118
We mustn't leave Ben!

653
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:33,802
But we should wait until Ben gets back.
I'll wait as long as I can.

654
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:36,004
Right now, I want you in
that cellar where it's safe.

655
01:05:36,141 --> 01:05:39,679
But maybe we should-
Into the cellar, Helen. Now.

656
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:43,262
Your daughter needs you.

657
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:18,838
Sarah?

658
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:31,234
Oh, my baby!

659
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:54,749
I want that gun.

660
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:57,381
God. You go to hell.

661
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:03,179
I want that gun. Give it up, Cooper!
just crawl back into-

662
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:08,351
Help me! No!

663
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:11,024
Cooper! Cooper!

664
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:13,317
Open this door,
Goddamn it!

665
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:19,032
Son of a bitch, Cooper!

666
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:22,782
Open it up!
Cooper!

667
01:07:30,922 --> 01:07:34,381
Cooper! Open this door!

668
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:37,755
Goddamn it!

669
01:07:40,682 --> 01:07:45,392
Barbara!
Give that to me!

670
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,347
Cooper! Son of a bitch!

671
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:54,901
Let me in!
Let me in!

672
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:57,275
Cooper!

673
01:07:57,365 --> 01:08:00,778
Open the door!

674
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:06,363
Cooper!
Let me in!

675
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,342
Cooper!

676
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:29,853
- Go on! Push!
- I'm trying!

677
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,650
Push!

678
01:08:45,747 --> 01:08:48,205
Let him in!
Let him in!

679
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:54,623
The gun! Get his gun!

680
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:16,191
S-Sarah?

681
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:21,070
Shoot it.

682
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,532
No.

683
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:27,990
Shoot it, Cooper.

684
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:30,994
No, I-
Shoot it, Cooper.

685
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:33,416
But... it's my-

686
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:35,835
No!

687
01:09:40,802 --> 01:09:43,510
Ohh.

688
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:06,783
Stop it! Ben, are you crazy?
Stop it!

689
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:13,577
Cooper, no!
Cooper!

690
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:17,411
No! God!

691
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:22,215
Madness.

692
01:10:49,704 --> 01:10:51,286
They're coming.

693
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:53,742
No.

694
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:56,291
- We can still make it.
- No, I can't.

695
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:58,163
I'm hurt bad.

696
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:02,961
Go on.
Get out of here. Go!

697
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:06,634
I'll bring help if I can.

698
01:11:06,721 --> 01:11:07,836
Go!

699
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:38,156
Oh, God!

700
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:29,491
<i>Do not attempt
to reach friends or family</i>

701
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:32,043
<i>Do not attempt to reach
any of the rescue stations...</i>

702
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:35,212
<i>identified in previous advisories.</i>

703
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:37,916
<i>They may no longer be in operation.</i>

704
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:41,799
<i>Repeating this advisory number nine from
the Office of Emergency Preparedness...</i>

705
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:45,507
<i>dated 11:00 p.m. August 23, 1989.</i>

706
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:48,719
<i>It has been confirmed
that the bodies of the dead...</i>

707
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:52,101
<i>are being reactivated
by forces as yet unknown.</i>

708
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:54,432
Got that right.

709
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:58,111
<i>These reactivated
bodies are weak and uncoordinated</i>

710
01:16:58,197 --> 01:17:02,532
<i>but are capable of inflicting
damage on people and on property.</i>

711
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:05,906
<i>They are to be considered
extremely dangerous,</i>

712
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:09,114
<i>especially when encountered
in large numbers.</i>

713
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:13,247
<i>These bodies can be disposed of
in only one known manner-</i>

714
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:15,578
<i>that is by incapacitating the brain.</i>

715
01:17:15,673 --> 01:17:17,630
They got that right too.

716
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:20,003
<i>These reactivated bodies...</i>

717
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:23,462
<i>will attack warm-blooded animals
of all species,</i>

718
01:17:23,556 --> 01:17:27,265
<i>including human beings,
without pro vocation,</i>

719
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:30,931
<i>and will devour flesh of any prey.</i>

720
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:35,185
<i>It's been confirmed that acts
of homicide and cannibalism...</i>

721
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:37,979
<i>reported through the afternoon and evening...</i>

722
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:40,186
<i>of August 23, 1989...</i>

723
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:42,989
<i>are attributable,
at least in part,</i>

724
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:45,487
<i>to these reactivated bodies.</i>

725
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:27,366
Don't shoot!

726
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:29,990
Don't shoot!

727
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:40,955
Johnnie!

728
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:52,384
Jesus Goddamn holy-lovin' shit!

729
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:55,061
What in the name
of Jupiter's balls...

730
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:57,889
are you doin' out here
alone, little lady?

731
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:10,135
...they're hangin' out down there.

732
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:12,839
'Cause me and the boys
must have dragged out...

733
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:15,721
at least seven, eight
of them down there already.

734
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:20,271
Very interesting. Tell me,
Chief, are these things slow-moving?

735
01:20:20,357 --> 01:20:22,564
Yeah, they're dead.
They're all messed up.

736
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:25,393
Ward, puttin' on a little
extra weight, aren't you, buddy?

737
01:20:47,134 --> 01:20:50,252
They're us.
We're them, and they're us.

738
01:20:51,722 --> 01:20:53,508
Say what?

739
01:20:55,142 --> 01:20:57,053
Nothing.

740
01:20:57,144 --> 01:21:00,682
No more
beer for you, man!

741
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:04,687
- Having fun?
- Give me a break.

742
01:22:53,177 --> 01:22:55,384
Whoa.
Drag that outta here.

743
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:58,213
I'm goin' in there. Watch your back.
There may be more of 'em.

744
01:22:58,307 --> 01:22:59,797
All right.

745
01:23:09,443 --> 01:23:11,810
Oh!

746
01:23:11,904 --> 01:23:15,067
You came back.

747
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,032
You came back.

748
01:23:28,378 --> 01:23:30,085
There's another one for the fire.
