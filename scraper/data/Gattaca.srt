1
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,220
<i>Welcome to Gattaca.</i>

2
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,490
You keep your workstation so clean.

3
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:29,955
<i>- It's next to godliness.
- Godliness ...</i>

4
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:34,918
I reviewed your flight plan. Not
one error in a million keystrokes.

5
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:40,299
Phenomenal. It's right that someone
like you is taking us to Titan.

6
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:45,179
Has the committee approved the
mission? There's talk of delay.

7
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:50,392
You shouldn't listen to talk.
You leave in a week.

8
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:54,855
You've got a substance test.

9
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:29,556
<i>If you have to take a substance
test, report to the testing centre.</i>

10
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:42,027
Jerome. Never shy.
Pisses on command.

11
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:46,949
- A beautiful piece of equipment.
- You tell me every time I'm here.

12
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:54,748
I see a great many in my job.
Yours happens to be exceptional.

13
00:06:55,916 --> 00:07:00,879
Why didn't my folks
order one like that for me?

14
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:19,940
- Have I ever told you about my son?
- No.

15
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:23,443
Remind me to, sometime.

16
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,740
So you're about to go up.
One week left.

17
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:33,453
Please tell me
you're the least bit excited.

18
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:38,876
I'll tell you
at the end of the week.

19
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:52,347
Congratulations, Jerome.

20
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,643
Thank you.

21
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:03,108
How many launches are there
in a day? A dozen?

22
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:10,240
- Sometimes more.
- Only you watch every one of them.

23
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:18,499
If you're going to pretend
like you don't care, don't look up.

24
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,710
<i>The most unremarkable of events.</i>

25
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:26,924
<i>Jerome Morrow, Navigator 1 st Class,
is about to embark -</i>

26
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:33,180
<i>- on a one-year manned mission
to Titan, the 14th moon of Saturn.</i>

27
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:39,269
<i>This highly prestigious assignment
was guaranteed Jerome at birth.</i>

28
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:47,611
<i>He has all the gifts required.
A genetic quotient second to none.</i>

29
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:53,242
<i>There's nothing remarkable about
the progress of Jerome Morrow.</i>

30
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:57,162
<i>Except that I am not Jerome Morrow.</i>

31
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:10,592
<i>I was conceived in the Riviera.
Not the French Riviera.</i>

32
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,887
<i>The Detroit variety.</i>

33
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:20,060
<i>They used to say that a love child
has a greater chance of happiness.</i>

34
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:23,438
<i>They don't say that any more.</i>

35
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:28,694
<i>I don't know
why my mother trusted God -</i>

36
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:31,989
<i>- rather than her local geneticist.</i>

37
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:39,538
<i>Ten fingers, ten toes, that's all
that used to matter... Not now.</i>

38
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:46,211
<i>Only seconds old, the ex act time
and cause of my death was known.</i>

39
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:56,096
Neurological condition, 60%,
manic depression, 42% probability.

40
00:09:56,263 --> 00:10:01,059
<i>Attention deficit disorder,
89% probability. Heart disorder ...</i>

41
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:07,482
<i>... 99% probability.
Early fatal potential.</i>

42
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:14,072
- Life expectancy: 30.2 years.
- 30 years?

43
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,621
<i>- The name for the certificate?
- Vincent Anton.</i>

44
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:25,876
That's a good name.

45
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:33,467
I know he'll do something.
You'll do something.

46
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:43,185
<i>I quickly thought of myself
as others did. Chronically ill.</i>

47
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:47,481
<i>Every skinned knee and runny nose
was treated as a fatal threat.</i>

48
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:54,780
<i>The insurance won't cover it. If he
fell ... There's nothing I can do.</i>

49
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:08,418
<i>Like most other parents then,
they wanted their next child -</i>

50
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:13,382
<i>- to be conceived in what
has become the natural way.</i>

51
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,678
Your extracted eggs, Marie, -

52
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:22,641
- have been fertilized
with Antonio's sperm.

53
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:28,605
We have screened two healthy boys
and two very healthy girls.

54
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:33,277
Without predispositions
to any inheritable diseases.

55
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:41,076
Let's select the most compatible
candidate. What gender do you want?

56
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:47,499
We would want Vincent
to have a brother to play with.

57
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:56,133
<i>You have specified hazel eyes,
dark hair and ... fair skin.</i>

58
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,970
I've eradicated
prejudicial conditions:

59
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:06,894
Premature baldness, alcoholism,
propensity for violence, obesity.

60
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,064
<i>We didn't want ...
Diseases, yes, but ...</i>

61
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:15,235
We would like to leave
a few things to chance.

62
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:21,325
Give your child the best start. We
have enough imperfection built-in.

63
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:27,498
Your child doesn't need any
additional burdens. It's still you.

64
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,751
Simply the best of you.

65
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:35,797
You could conceive naturally 1,000
times and never get such a result.

66
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:44,181
<i>That's how Anton came to be.
A son worthy of my father's name.</i>

67
00:12:55,817 --> 00:13:01,907
- I'm proud of you, son.
- See how much he's grown.

68
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,215
<i>When we played blood brothers -</i>

69
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:22,302
<i>- I understood my blood was
very different from Anton's.</i>

70
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:28,559
<i>I'd need a lot more than a drop
if I was going to get anywhere.</i>

71
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:52,082
<i>We played chicken.
When our parents weren't watching -</i>

72
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:58,380
<i>- we'd swim as far out as we dared
and see who'd turn back first.</i>

73
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:15,772
Come on, you coward!

74
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:19,860
<i>Of course it was always me.</i>

75
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:25,616
<i>Anton was the stronger swimmer
and had no excuse to fail.</i>

76
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:33,624
300 million,
350 million, 400 million.

77
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:38,962
<i>Maybe it was my love of the planets
or just my dislike for this one, -</i>

78
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:44,384
<i>- but for as long as I remember
I've dreamed of going into space.</i>

79
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:50,307
750 million,
800 million, 850 million.

80
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:56,480
How many astronauts are there?
I bet I could be one if I wanted.

81
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:59,900
Don't eat that. It's Pluto.

82
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:09,785
<i>My goals didn't change a lot.
Much to my parents' dismay.</i>

83
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:13,205
<i>Vincent ...</i>

84
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:21,713
<i>Be realistic. With
a heart condition like yours ...</i>

85
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:28,595
- There's a chance my heart's fine.
- One chance in 100.

86
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:33,725
- I'll take it.
- They won't.

87
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:38,522
You've got to understand something.

88
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,613
You'll only get inside a spaceship
to clean it.

89
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:54,997
<i>He was right. I lied on my resume,
but my real resume was my cells.</i>

90
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:58,750
<i>Why waste money on training me -</i>

91
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:03,338
<i>- when there are 1, 000 other
applicants with a cleaner profile?</i>

92
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:07,968
<i>It is illegal to discriminate.
"Genoism", it's called.</i>

93
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:11,013
<i>But no one takes the law seriously.</i>

94
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:23,108
<i>If you refuse to tell, they take
a sample from a door handle -</i>

95
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:28,989
<i>- or a handshake. Even the saliva
on your application form.</i>

96
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:32,576
<i>A legal drug test can become-</i>

97
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:38,874
<i>- an illegal peek
at your future in the company.</i>

98
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:49,510
Sure you want to do this?
You know you're going to lose.

99
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:03,357
<i>It was the last time we swam
together. Out into the open sea.</i>

100
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:10,113
<i>Knowing each stroke out was one
we'd have to make back.</i>

101
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:28,090
<i>But something was different. Every
time Anton tried to pull away -</i>

102
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:32,386
<i>- he found me right beside him.</i>

103
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:38,100
<i>Until finally
the impossible happened.</i>

104
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:40,310
Vincent!

105
00:17:55,534 --> 00:18:00,164
<i>For once in our lives Anton was
not as strong as he believed -</i>

106
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:05,586
<i>- and I was not as weak. That
made everything else possible.</i>

107
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:55,928
<i>Like others in my situation I moved
around getting work where I could.</i>

108
00:18:56,136 --> 00:19:00,599
<i>I must've cleaned
half the toilets in the state.</i>

109
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:06,939
<i>The underclass wasn't determined
by social status or skin colour now.</i>

110
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:13,487
<i>- Welcome to Gattaca, gentlemen.
- Today discrimination is a science.</i>

111
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:19,243
There's your cleaning material.
Start here and clean to the back.

112
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:23,163
I want to see my smiling face
on that floor.

113
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:36,218
Dreaming of space, Your Majesty?

114
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:39,471
Come here.

115
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:45,561
Start by cleaning this space.

116
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,653
<i>I knew how far away I was from my
goal when I stood right beside it.</i>

117
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:11,438
- Don't clean the glass too well.
- What do you mean?

118
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:14,274
You might get ideas.

119
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:19,821
But if the glass is clean, it'll be
easier to see me on the other side.

120
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:16,003
<i>I knew it was just brave talk.
No matter how much I studied, -</i>

121
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,841
<i>- the best test score in the world
needs a blood test to match it.</i>

122
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:26,805
<i>I had to go to extreme measures.</i>

123
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:31,685
<i>The man who came didn't exactly
advertise in the Yellow Pages.</i>

124
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:34,396
Stand straight.

125
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:39,318
- How did you hear about me?
- People.

126
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:44,823
Any distinguishing marks?
Tattoos, scars, birth marks?

127
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,534
No.

128
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:52,372
Are you serious about this?
I hope you're not wasting my time.

129
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:58,086
- I'd give 100%.
- That'll get you halfway there.

130
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:04,843
That's an old edition,
but I know it all by heart.

131
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:12,267
- The commitment is binding.
- You have somebody in mind?

132
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:39,920
<i>For the genetic elite, success
is attainable, but not guaranteed.</i>

133
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:44,299
<i>There is no gene for fate.</i>

134
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:49,763
<i>And when a member of the elite
falls on hard times -</i>

135
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:54,268
<i>- their genetic identity
becomes a valued commodity.</i>

136
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:57,312
<i>One man's loss is another's gain.</i>

137
00:23:57,479 --> 00:24:01,233
He's got impeccable credentials.
An unbelievable expiration date.

138
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:12,077
He'll practically live forever.
His IQ is off the register.

139
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:18,959
Better than 20/20 vision. Strong
heart. He could run through a wall.

140
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:27,092
If he could still run.

141
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:31,388
He was a big-time swimming star.

142
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:37,978
You could go anywhere with this
guy's DNA tucked under your arm.

143
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:46,486
- You look so right together.
- We don't look anything alike.

144
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:52,826
Nobody looks at photos today.
Christ, you could have my face.

145
00:24:53,035 --> 00:24:58,790
- How do I explain the accident?
- It happened out of the country.

146
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:06,006
No one knows he broke his back. He's
still a fully productive citizen.

147
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:12,012
- Just fill in his last year.
- You're a foreigner.

148
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:17,684
They don't care where you were born.
Blood has no nationality.

149
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:22,439
As long as it's got what they want,
it's the only passport you'll need.

150
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:29,863
- Who lives up there?
- Well, I certainly don't.

151
00:25:30,656 --> 00:25:34,159
<i>The process of becoming him began.</i>

152
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:38,705
<i>Myopia is one of the most obvious
signs of a disadvantaged birth.</i>

153
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:43,627
- Isn't there another way?
- Surgery will leave scars.

154
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:47,923
It's contact lenses or a white cane.

155
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:52,719
- Besides, the colour doesn't match.
- He's right.

156
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:56,723
My eyes are prettier.

157
00:25:58,392 --> 00:26:01,353
I take 25% of all you make.

158
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,567
If it fails, all this equipment
must be returned in seven days.

159
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:10,904
- And you lose your deposit.
- Wait! You said 20%.

160
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:14,158
- 20%.
- It's not negotiable.

161
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:35,679
- I guess that's it.
- No. There's still the height.

162
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:41,185
How tall were you
before the accident?

163
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:47,107
- His profile says he's 6' 1 ".
- I can wear lifts.

164
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:53,739
Even with lifts
you're not that tall.

165
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:57,284
So what?

166
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:04,082
<i>No ...</i>

167
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:11,215
- We never discussed that.
- I thought you were serious.

168
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:15,511
I am. I'm not doing that.

169
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:20,807
No.

170
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:30,234
<i>Now Jerome knew I was committed.</i>

171
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,155
<i>I endured the pain by reminding
myself that when I did stand up -</i>

172
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:39,493
<i>- I'd be exactly two inches
closer to the stars.</i>

173
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:47,876
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Do you want to go dancing?

174
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:55,092
You had to be a right-hander.
No one orders southpaws any more.

175
00:27:56,593 --> 00:28:01,807
Jerome Morrow. It's a nice name.

176
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:08,021
- It's my name.
- I can't be you without it.

177
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:12,317
What makes you think
you can be me at all?

178
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,703
Look at this.

179
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:27,374
- Look at it.
- It's nice.

180
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:35,799
- Is it real?
- Are you colour-blind? It's silver.

181
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:41,346
Jerome Morrow was never meant
to be one step down on the podium.

182
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:48,687
With all I had going for me,
I was still second best.

183
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:54,401
Me!
So how do you expect to pull it off?

184
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:00,574
I don't know, exactly.

185
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:07,206
Your signature needs work.

186
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:10,250
<i>Soon we were put to the test.</i>

187
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:17,090
<i>Jerome had the genes to get
into Gattaca, but not the desire.</i>

188
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:22,679
- Do you really want to be in there?
- Not in there. Up there.

189
00:29:25,057 --> 00:29:30,771
- What's up there?
- That's want I want to see, Jerome.

190
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:36,735
Call me Eugene. My middle name.

191
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:41,990
If you're going to be Jerome,
you better start getting used to it.

192
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:56,129
- I must go. Where's my sample?
- In the fridge. Door on the left.

193
00:29:57,714 --> 00:30:01,802
- Which pouch?
- Any of them.

194
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:09,142
- You think I should test it?
- If you like.

195
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:21,155
- What's wrong with the machine?
- You've been drinking again!

196
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:26,118
- I haven't.
- Christ, it's eight in the morning!

197
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:38,046
This is no joke.
My interview is in an hour!

198
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:49,683
- There's more vodka than piss!
- I had half a glass to celebrate.

199
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:54,521
- Friday's will be all right.
- There's only Wednesday left.

200
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:58,108
That's the one.

201
00:31:08,911 --> 00:31:13,874
It's not too late to back out.

202
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:21,298
This is the last day
you will be you and I will be me.

203
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:26,887
Well?

204
00:31:54,289 --> 00:32:00,254
- Congratulations.
- What about the interview?

205
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,714
That was it.

206
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:14,017
I got it.

207
00:32:14,184 --> 00:32:17,312
Of course you got it.

208
00:32:25,946 --> 00:32:32,953
<i>Each day I would dispose of
all my loose skin, nails and hair.</i>

209
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:39,001
<i>To limit how much of my In- Valid
self I'd leave in the Valid world.</i>

210
00:32:44,715 --> 00:32:51,054
<i>Eugene prepared samples of his
body matter so I'd pass for him.</i>

211
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:54,641
<i>Urine for the substance tests.</i>

212
00:32:54,808 --> 00:33:01,398
<i>Blood for the security checks
and vials filled with other traces.</i>

213
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:05,736
<i>Eugene gave me his identity
while I paid the rent -</i>

214
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:10,657
<i>- and kept him in the style
to which he'd become accustomed.</i>

215
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:17,247
<i>Eugene had never been called
"utero", "faith birth", "In- Valid".</i>

216
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:24,296
<i>As a "Valid", he suffered
under the burden of perfection.</i>

217
00:33:26,465 --> 00:33:32,179
<i>I was now a member of a new
and detested segment of society.</i>

218
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:39,186
<i>One of those who won't accept
their fate. A "borrowed ladder".</i>

219
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:42,689
<i>Or... a "de-gene-erate".</i>

220
00:33:48,612 --> 00:33:53,659
<i>In the guise of Jerome Morrow
I've risen quickly in Gattaca.</i>

221
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:59,081
<i>Only one of the mission directors
has come close to exposing me.</i>

222
00:33:59,248 --> 00:34:05,838
<i>He may have more success exposing
me in death than he did in life.</i>

223
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:32,948
I think we can rule out suicide.

224
00:34:33,198 --> 00:34:35,409
Thank you.

225
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:43,584
This will take a while.
We may have to push things back.

226
00:34:55,554 --> 00:35:00,350
Irene, I want you
to assist the investigators.

227
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:06,440
- That would put me behind.
- I appreciate your sacrifice.

228
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:11,570
- I won't lose my place in line?
- Your place is assured.

229
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:17,117
So kindly inform the authorities
we will cooperate in any way, -

230
00:35:17,284 --> 00:35:21,622
- although we can't tolerate
a major disruption.

231
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:26,919
- Thank you, Irene.
- Thank you, Director.

232
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:33,926
- How will this affect the mission?
- We'll go ahead as planned.

233
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:37,513
The launch can only be this week.

234
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:45,312
Tragic though this event may be, it
hasn't stopped the planets turning.

235
00:35:55,906 --> 00:36:01,245
- What happened?
- I'm going up.

236
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:06,834
- End of the week.
- That soon?

237
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,714
- What about the mission director?
- He's dead.

238
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:17,886
Are you serious?

239
00:36:18,053 --> 00:36:23,851
They found him beaten so badly
they had to check his name tag.

240
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:27,145
You are serious.

241
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:33,527
There's nothing
between us and ignition.

242
00:36:33,694 --> 00:36:37,739
I'm going up.

243
00:36:37,906 --> 00:36:40,909
- The man was murdered?
- I didn't do it.

244
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:47,332
- It'll be crawling with Hoovers.
- I'll handle the J. Edgars.

245
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:53,380
What if they do find something?
I'll be out of their jurisdiction.

246
00:36:57,968 --> 00:37:00,053
We have to get drunk immediately.

247
00:37:07,644 --> 00:37:13,358
Good evening, gentlemen. I hear
you're leaving us, Mr. Morrow.

248
00:37:13,525 --> 00:37:17,863
- We're going to miss you.
- You've opened the wine, I hope?

249
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,782
Pour yourself a glass, Cavendish.

250
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:47,518
How old is the specimen?

251
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:53,941
- I kissed him five minutes ago.
- I'll see what I can do.

252
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:02,115
- You want the full sequence?
- Yes.

253
00:38:03,534 --> 00:38:05,744
Good luck.

254
00:38:22,678 --> 00:38:29,977
- 9.3. Quite a catch.
- Yes. Quite a catch.

255
00:38:56,336 --> 00:39:02,509
<i>God, I've told Cavendish ... This
has only been open five minutes!</i>

256
00:39:02,718 --> 00:39:05,262
Wine needs to breathe.

257
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:12,519
They say being weightless is the
closest thing to being in the womb.

258
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:20,861
I can't believe you pulled this off.
They're sending you up there.

259
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:23,489
Up there! You, of all people.

260
00:39:23,697 --> 00:39:28,577
You'll be alone
in that room for a year.

261
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:34,500
- It's bigger than your tin can.
- What are you going to do?

262
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:38,420
I have my books.
I travel in my head.

263
00:39:38,587 --> 00:39:43,008
I wish you had company.
Someone you didn't have to pay for.

264
00:39:43,175 --> 00:39:48,514
- I wouldn't have it any other way.
- What are you going to do?

265
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:54,478
I'm going to finish this.

266
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:09,076
What's Titan like
this time of year?

267
00:40:11,078 --> 00:40:16,708
What's Titan like?
Titan is exactly like this.

268
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:33,976
The cloud around it is so thick,
no one can tell what's underneath.

269
00:40:35,185 --> 00:40:40,315
- Maybe there's nothing there.
- There's something there.

270
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:50,284
- You should be going, not me.
- Why is that?

271
00:40:51,618 --> 00:40:56,582
Because up there
your legs wouldn't matter.

272
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:05,048
I'm scared of heights.

273
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:26,403
I'm sorry.

274
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:31,867
Do you want this?
I'll save some for you, shall I?

275
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:44,838
I'm so sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.

276
00:41:48,634 --> 00:41:53,263
Don't give me a hard time.
Give me a break.

277
00:41:54,348 --> 00:42:00,437
- Come on! Help!
- I'm sorry.

278
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:12,157
<i>I wasn't drunk ...</i>

279
00:42:12,324 --> 00:42:16,620
<i>... when I walked
in front of that car.</i>

280
00:42:16,787 --> 00:42:22,417
I stepped right out in front of it.
I'd never been more sober, ever.

281
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:29,675
- Go to sleep.
- I couldn't even get that right.

282
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:34,263
If at first you don't succeed,
try, try again.

283
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:37,724
Go to sleep.

284
00:42:41,436 --> 00:42:44,565
I'm proud of you, Vincent.

285
00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:51,029
You must be drunk
to call me Vincent.

286
00:43:30,694 --> 00:43:35,449
- How much do you need?
- 20 minutes.

287
00:43:54,885 --> 00:43:57,888
You can go.

288
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:07,272
It's all right, Irene.
You're excused.

289
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,675
We found our man. It's the only
specimen we can't account for.

290
00:44:34,842 --> 00:44:39,346
- Every 10 years things go our way.
- Tell me about the eyelash.

291
00:44:39,513 --> 00:44:45,060
An unregistered In-Valid. A janitor.
He disappeared a few years back.

292
00:44:45,227 --> 00:44:51,275
- The specimen could be from then.
- Nothing lies around here for long.

293
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:55,988
Would a janitor come back after so
long to kill a man he never knew?

294
00:44:56,155 --> 00:44:58,365
His profile suggests he's violent.

295
00:44:58,574 --> 00:45:06,999
It also suggests he's a sick man.
There's a 90% chance he's dead.

296
00:45:07,166 --> 00:45:11,295
That leaves a 10% chance
he's still alive.

297
00:45:11,461 --> 00:45:16,925
<i>The owner of the eyelash is the
murderer. I'll do a cross-check ...</i>

298
00:45:17,092 --> 00:45:22,222
- He has no living relatives.
- That's a damn shame, sir.

299
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:26,143
Check the entry log.
Alibis, grudges.

300
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:31,815
I see a lot of dry eyes. The mission
director was not universally loved.

301
00:45:31,982 --> 00:45:36,403
He was leading cutbacks
in the programme.

302
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:39,198
<i>With all due respect, sir ...</i>

303
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:45,454
Whatever you say.

304
00:45:59,843 --> 00:46:02,596
Jerome the metronome.

305
00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:07,267
I could play the piano
by that heartbeat of his.

306
00:46:07,434 --> 00:46:12,856
- We have a suspect.
- That is a relief. Who is he?

307
00:46:13,023 --> 00:46:17,778
We found an unaccounted-for
specimen. Here's his picture.

308
00:46:19,404 --> 00:46:23,158
- An In-Valid.
- We're still following other leads.

309
00:46:23,325 --> 00:46:28,789
- I'm posting this immediately.
- I'm curious, Director.

310
00:46:28,956 --> 00:46:33,669
An advantage, I should imagine,
in your line of work.

311
00:46:33,836 --> 00:46:38,799
<i>- Your hiring practices ...
- Our "recruitment philosophy".</i>

312
00:46:38,966 --> 00:46:45,722
- Who do you have to be, to be here?
- We don't take common citizens.

313
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:49,059
Are they all equally excellent?

314
00:46:49,226 --> 00:46:53,981
Occasionally we've had to accept
candidates with minor shortcomings.

315
00:46:54,148 --> 00:47:00,821
But nothing that would stop them
joining the police, for example.

316
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:07,578
Now, there are enough of the right
kind to warrant a new standard.

317
00:47:07,744 --> 00:47:14,835
Bodies with minds to match.
Essential, as we push out further.

318
00:47:15,002 --> 00:47:20,132
- Yet you still monitor performance.
- To see they meet their potential.

319
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:24,261
- And exceeding it?
- No one exceeds his potential.

320
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:30,100
If he did, we just didn't accurately
gauge his potential right off.

321
00:47:41,862 --> 00:47:44,573
- All right?
- Terrific.

322
00:48:09,223 --> 00:48:13,227
The entry log for the past week.

323
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:19,900
What about you, Irene?
Do you have an alibi?

324
00:48:20,108 --> 00:48:25,239
- I was alone.
- I find that hard to believe.

325
00:48:34,581 --> 00:48:38,585
I'll take care of that
for you, Mr. Morrow.

326
00:48:51,139 --> 00:48:57,020
I see I'm not the only one who looks
up every time there's a launch.

327
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:05,362
- It's awful about the director.
- Awful it didn't happen sooner.

328
00:49:05,529 --> 00:49:12,494
Didn't he threaten to cancel your
mission? Somebody did you a favour.

329
00:49:12,661 --> 00:49:17,374
- Do they know who I should thank?
- They found an eyelash.

330
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:22,713
- Does it have a name?
- Just some In-Valid.

331
00:49:22,921 --> 00:49:26,425
<i>Jerome ...</i>

332
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:32,306
I had you sequenced.
I read your profile.

333
00:49:32,472 --> 00:49:35,809
I'm sorry.

334
00:49:37,436 --> 00:49:42,065
Seems you're everything
they say you are and more.

335
00:49:42,232 --> 00:49:46,695
You're engineered
just like the rest of us.

336
00:49:46,862 --> 00:49:50,199
Not quite.

337
00:49:50,365 --> 00:49:55,162
"Unacceptable likelihood of heart
failure." That's how they put it.

338
00:49:55,370 --> 00:50:00,083
The only trip I'll take in space
is around the sun on this satellite.

339
00:50:01,919 --> 00:50:06,507
If there's anything wrong with you,
I can't see it from where I stand.

340
00:50:09,593 --> 00:50:12,346
<i>If you don't believe me ...</i>

341
00:50:14,473 --> 00:50:17,851
Here. Take it.

342
00:50:26,401 --> 00:50:30,948
If you're still interested,
let me know.

343
00:50:32,825 --> 00:50:36,954
I'm sorry. The wind caught it.

344
00:50:57,432 --> 00:51:01,520
<i>Please check
the latest Gattaca bulletin.</i>

345
00:51:10,904 --> 00:51:17,661
Jerome. Is this
the approach path we discussed?

346
00:51:19,246 --> 00:51:25,752
- Absolutely, Director.
- Quite right.

347
00:51:40,184 --> 00:51:44,771
Listen, I want what I ordered.

348
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:50,068
It's a completely different colour.
No. I'm bored of talking to you.

349
00:51:50,277 --> 00:51:54,281
I'll call you back.

350
00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:59,119
That was about your hair dye.
They've sent me "Summer Wheat".

351
00:51:59,286 --> 00:52:02,289
It's too light.

352
00:52:02,456 --> 00:52:06,460
"Why don't you try a change?"
We can't use it!

353
00:52:07,961 --> 00:52:12,841
- I'll probably have to pay for it.
- We can't stay here.

354
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:18,263
<i>- The idiots I have to deal with ...!
- They think I killed the director.</i>

355
00:52:20,015 --> 00:52:24,228
- What makes them think that?
- They found my eyelash.

356
00:52:26,063 --> 00:52:29,149
- Where?
- In the corridor.

357
00:52:29,316 --> 00:52:32,069
Thank God it wasn't in your eye.

358
00:52:32,236 --> 00:52:38,408
My picture is everywhere. I can't
turn around without seeing my face.

359
00:52:38,575 --> 00:52:45,666
<i>- They'll recognize me. They will!
- I don't recognize you.</i>

360
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:51,839
They won't accept one of their elite
could've suckered them for so long.

361
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:58,262
No, we do as we planned. You're
Jerome Morrow, Navigator 1 st Class.

362
00:52:58,428 --> 00:53:02,975
I'm not Jerome Morrow.
I'm a murder suspect.

363
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:08,564
What are you doing?
That's more than a day's worth!

364
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:14,903
<i>- We can't stay here.
- Stop that! Fine ... fine!</i>

365
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:20,826
Leave if you want. But don't
take that stuff. It's mine!

366
00:53:22,035 --> 00:53:25,372
I would've chosen a brave partner -

367
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:30,586
- if I'd known you'd go
belly-up on me at the last gasp.

368
00:53:30,752 --> 00:53:35,299
You can't quit on me now.

369
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:40,429
Do you want me to wheel in there
and finish the job myself?

370
00:53:40,637 --> 00:53:48,061
<i>- They are going to find me.
- You still don't understand ...</i>

371
00:53:51,023 --> 00:53:57,613
When they look at you, they
don't see you any more. Only me.

372
00:54:10,292 --> 00:54:15,255
Keep your lashes on your lids
where they belong.

373
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:18,592
How could you be so careless?

374
00:54:50,332 --> 00:54:53,836
- I'm going out.
- Where?

375
00:54:54,044 --> 00:54:57,548
I want some fun before they nail me.

376
00:54:57,714 --> 00:55:03,053
- Are you sure that's a good idea?
- You said not to change anything.

377
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:08,976
- Who's going?
- I'd say everybody.

378
00:55:09,142 --> 00:55:13,397
If I don't go
it'll look suspicious.

379
00:55:13,564 --> 00:55:17,568
You don't want to look suspicious,
do you?

380
00:55:20,404 --> 00:55:22,614
Thanks.

381
00:56:21,715 --> 00:56:26,053
Who ordered this?
What are we doing here?

382
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:31,016
I'm following a lead. Forgive me,
but I'm a detective. I follow leads.

383
00:56:31,225 --> 00:56:36,897
- Why should the suspect be here?
- He's an In-Valid.

384
00:56:37,064 --> 00:56:41,735
- This is where the In-Valids are.
- He's an In-Valid.

385
00:56:41,902 --> 00:56:48,325
He's been in hiding all these years.
You think he'll lie down for us now?

386
00:56:48,492 --> 00:56:52,246
- What do you suggest?
- Go back to the scene.

387
00:56:52,454 --> 00:56:55,749
Sweep the area around Gattaca.

388
00:57:18,856 --> 00:57:25,279
- You're a navigator? At Gattaca?
- That's what it says, doesn't it?

389
00:57:25,445 --> 00:57:32,828
- It doesn't say you're crippled.
- I hurt my leg training, you moron.

390
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:40,544
How dare you question me?
What's your number?

391
00:57:40,752 --> 00:57:45,632
- Your number, you fucking flatfoot!
- What do you want? An apology?

392
00:57:45,841 --> 00:57:52,723
It gets to you that I can live your
dreams. I'm leaving this dirtball!

393
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:57,686
- You're harassing me!
- My mistake.

394
00:57:57,853 --> 00:58:00,647
What's your number?

395
00:58:02,232 --> 00:58:07,279
This is a crime scene.
What's this man doing here?

396
00:58:07,488 --> 00:58:12,451
- What are you doing, old man?
- My job, sir.

397
00:58:12,618 --> 00:58:18,373
- This is evidence.
- But it's just trash.

398
00:59:08,757 --> 00:59:14,638
You didn't know?
Wonderful, wasn't it?

399
00:59:15,681 --> 00:59:19,726
12 fingers or 1, it's how you play.

400
00:59:19,893 --> 00:59:25,023
That piece can only
be played with 12.

401
00:59:40,497 --> 00:59:46,170
- What's all this about?
- It's probably nothing.

402
01:00:23,874 --> 01:00:30,130
No. I don't want to give you
a contaminated specimen. Get it?

403
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:05,082
Thanks. You never know
where those swabs have been.

404
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:10,337
I want to show you something.

405
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:58,343
Come on, we'll miss it.

406
01:02:24,912 --> 01:02:28,499
Come on. We'll miss it.

407
01:03:14,628 --> 01:03:18,674
What did I tell you?

408
01:03:37,484 --> 01:03:41,572
Strange. Your eyes look different.

409
01:03:41,738 --> 01:03:47,119
- I guess it must be the light.
- Must be.

410
01:04:09,516 --> 01:04:13,562
Positive match. I'm impressed.

411
01:04:13,729 --> 01:04:19,193
- The cup was used recently?
- Two samples, two days.

412
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:24,114
He may have returned to the
crime scene to get a drink of water.

413
01:04:24,281 --> 01:04:28,577
- Or he may still work there.
- We checked all the service staff.

414
01:04:28,744 --> 01:04:34,041
I don't think he cleans any more.
I think he's there in disguise.

415
01:04:34,208 --> 01:04:40,714
- A borrowed ladder at Gattaca?
- Far-fetched, but not impossible.

416
01:04:40,923 --> 01:04:48,055
He can't be among the elite. He's
mentally and physically inferior.

417
01:04:48,222 --> 01:04:54,061
Maybe he is an imposter
and maybe the director found out.

418
01:04:54,228 --> 01:04:57,481
Let's sample every employee
intravenously.

419
01:04:57,648 --> 01:05:04,488
We'd close them down for days. No,
take a fingertip or a urine sample.

420
01:05:04,655 --> 01:05:09,451
I suggest blood from the vein.
I hope I'm not out of line.

421
01:05:37,688 --> 01:05:41,358
It's only a matter of time, sir.

422
01:05:44,862 --> 01:05:51,785
What's with the plungers, Lamar?
You open up a blood bank?

423
01:05:51,952 --> 01:05:59,585
The detectives fear my methods
may have been compromised.

424
01:06:12,055 --> 01:06:18,562
- Goddamn! Are you out of practice?
- Let me look at that.

425
01:06:18,729 --> 01:06:22,900
- It's all right.
- Luckily, we have enough.

426
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:28,113
If you need any more,
you can get it off his shoes.

427
01:06:42,211 --> 01:06:45,339
Irene.

428
01:06:47,591 --> 01:06:53,847
- So you didn't do it after all?
- I guess someone beat me to it.

429
01:06:54,056 --> 01:06:57,267
I guess.

430
01:07:02,523 --> 01:07:05,526
I leave in two days.

431
01:07:07,694 --> 01:07:11,365
<i>I guess you know that. But ...</i>

432
01:07:23,877 --> 01:07:26,880
That's the last.

433
01:07:27,047 --> 01:07:30,259
- Something's wrong.
- He's not here.

434
01:07:30,425 --> 01:07:37,724
- I say we test again.
- No. No more disruptions.

435
01:07:37,891 --> 01:07:44,481
- You have a murderer in your midst.
- Your presence is more of a threat.

436
01:07:44,648 --> 01:07:49,528
The window for our latest launch is
open for seven days every 70 years.

437
01:07:49,695 --> 01:07:55,868
- It's crucial we leave on time.
- This mission means a lot to you.

438
01:07:56,076 --> 01:07:59,496
Your late colleague opposed it.

439
01:07:59,663 --> 01:08:05,460
Take another look at my profile.
I haven't a violent bone in my body.

440
01:08:05,627 --> 01:08:10,507
My apologies.
He won't trouble you any further.

441
01:08:10,674 --> 01:08:15,554
This is not the only place
we can look.

442
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:21,477
Let's start making the rounds.

443
01:09:21,995 --> 01:09:26,250
I'm luckier than most.
Not as lucky as some.

444
01:09:28,669 --> 01:09:34,925
- I know something about that.
- What heart problem have you had?

445
01:09:35,133 --> 01:09:38,887
Did you get yours broken once?

446
01:09:41,849 --> 01:09:48,105
I had this crazy idea you were more
interested in the murder than in me.

447
01:09:49,523 --> 01:09:52,651
You're right.

448
01:09:54,278 --> 01:09:57,865
That's a crazy idea.

449
01:09:59,783 --> 01:10:03,203
Would you like to dance?

450
01:10:38,405 --> 01:10:44,661
<i>It's funny. You work so hard
to get away from a place ...</i>

451
01:10:45,621 --> 01:10:52,920
And when you finally get to leave,
you find a reason to stay.

452
01:10:57,841 --> 01:11:03,764
- A year is a long time.
- Not so long.

453
01:11:03,931 --> 01:11:08,101
Just once around the sun.

454
01:11:15,651 --> 01:11:21,281
Hello, I'm your detective
for the evening. Please stay here.

455
01:11:22,658 --> 01:11:27,704
Don't leave! Am I speaking
in some strange foreign language?

456
01:11:27,871 --> 01:11:33,794
Check lenses, dentures, napkins,
cigarette butts, saliva off cups.

457
01:11:35,379 --> 01:11:40,008
That's a familiar face.
Check him out.

458
01:11:43,136 --> 01:11:48,100
- I thought you wanted to dance.
- Where are you going?

459
01:11:48,642 --> 01:11:51,645
Jerome!

460
01:12:00,487 --> 01:12:04,074
- Are you insane?
- Come on!

461
01:12:21,508 --> 01:12:23,510
Where did they go?

462
01:12:29,516 --> 01:12:32,519
Come on.

463
01:12:43,071 --> 01:12:46,658
- I can't do that!
- You just did.

464
01:12:47,534 --> 01:12:52,748
Don't touch your face.
Don't swallow. Clean his teeth.

465
01:12:56,752 --> 01:12:59,213
Vincent!

466
01:13:02,716 --> 01:13:06,136
Vincent!

467
01:13:11,266 --> 01:13:14,353
Who's Vincent?

468
01:13:18,524 --> 01:13:21,151
<i>I ...</i>

469
01:13:24,571 --> 01:13:27,908
Don't say anything.

470
01:13:28,075 --> 01:13:31,328
Don't say anything.

471
01:16:23,375 --> 01:16:26,253
What happened?

472
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:32,551
The scars on your legs?

473
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:38,557
Remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron?

474
01:16:38,724 --> 01:16:44,897
I bumped into the front fender.
Looked left instead of right.

475
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:54,198
- Is that the new or the old excuse?
- The old one.

476
01:16:55,782 --> 01:17:00,746
- You are involved with the murder.
- That's not true, Irene.

477
01:17:10,088 --> 01:17:13,759
Isn't that the man from last night?

478
01:17:14,843 --> 01:17:16,970
He's nobody.

479
01:17:26,939 --> 01:17:34,112
He's one of our best. He has nothing
to do with this business.

480
01:17:35,405 --> 01:17:38,325
Jerome Morrow.

481
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:52,256
You don't look well, Jerome.
Why don't you go home?

482
01:18:02,808 --> 01:18:05,686
- Yes?
- Jerome Morrow.

483
01:18:05,853 --> 01:18:11,066
He's ill. A little nausea.
It's quite common before a mission.

484
01:18:11,275 --> 01:18:16,864
I want to visit him. I understand
you can show me the way.

485
01:19:00,324 --> 01:19:04,328
You don't know who he is, do you?

486
01:19:21,428 --> 01:19:25,349
- Hello?
- Be yourself today.

487
01:19:25,557 --> 01:19:30,979
- I was never very good at it.
- Tell the investigators you're ill.

488
01:19:31,146 --> 01:19:35,609
<i>- How long have I got?
- Not long.</i>

489
01:21:24,343 --> 01:21:27,846
I guess he's not home.

490
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:34,603
- I'm here to see Jerome Morrow.
- That's me. Come up.

491
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:38,524
I guess he's home.

492
01:22:12,432 --> 01:22:14,351
Come in.

493
01:22:14,351 --> 01:22:16,353
Come in.

494
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:20,274
Come in.

495
01:22:20,482 --> 01:22:23,735
Hello, sweetheart.

496
01:22:24,987 --> 01:22:28,907
Where's my kiss?

497
01:22:29,992 --> 01:22:37,708
- Good to see you're feeling better.
- Of course, now that you're here.

498
01:22:46,216 --> 01:22:51,096
Who's your friend? How can I help?

499
01:22:51,263 --> 01:22:55,309
- It's about the director.
- Again?

500
01:22:55,476 --> 01:22:59,146
- I hope it's no trouble.
- No, no.

501
01:22:59,313 --> 01:23:03,567
- I won't show you around. Sorry.
- Can't we do this another time?

502
01:23:03,734 --> 01:23:09,990
- This won't take a moment.
- Maybe he can tell me why I'm ill.

503
01:23:45,651 --> 01:23:49,738
Who were you expecting?

504
01:24:31,405 --> 01:24:37,327
<i>- We have our man in custody.
- I'll come right away.</i>

505
01:24:59,975 --> 01:25:05,564
- How are you, Jerome?
- Not bad, Jerome.

506
01:25:07,024 --> 01:25:12,446
- How the hell did you get up here?
- I can walk. I've been faking it.

507
01:25:29,004 --> 01:25:31,965
<i>Irene ...</i>

508
01:25:32,132 --> 01:25:35,803
Don't touch me!
I don't even know who you are.

509
01:25:35,969 --> 01:25:41,099
- I'm the same as I was yesterday.
- No more lies, Jerome.

510
01:25:41,308 --> 01:25:45,145
My name is Vincent Anton Freeman.

511
01:25:45,312 --> 01:25:51,318
I'm a faith birth or a de-gene-erate
or whatever. But I'm not a murderer.

512
01:25:52,986 --> 01:25:58,742
- You're a God-child?
- We do have one thing in common.

513
01:25:58,909 --> 01:26:04,498
Only I don't have 20-30 years left
in mine. It's 10,000 beats overdue.

514
01:26:04,665 --> 01:26:10,003
- It's not possible.
- You know what isn't possible.

515
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:13,841
Don't you, Irene?

516
01:26:14,049 --> 01:26:19,346
They've got you looking so hard for
any flaw, that that's all you see.

517
01:26:22,474 --> 01:26:27,813
For whatever it's worth, I'm here
to tell you that it is possible.

518
01:26:28,939 --> 01:26:32,693
It is possible.

519
01:27:09,897 --> 01:27:16,862
Congratulations, sir. His spit was
found in the dead director's eye.

520
01:27:17,029 --> 01:27:23,368
While I obsessed over an eyelash,
your instincts pointed the way.

521
01:27:23,577 --> 01:27:26,788
So the In-Valid wasn't involved?

522
01:27:26,955 --> 01:27:32,085
No, our friend acted alone. This
mission meant everything to him.

523
01:27:35,631 --> 01:27:39,551
He'll only live to see this launch.

524
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:45,474
Since nothing can stop the launch
now, he's very, very cooperative.

525
01:27:48,727 --> 01:27:55,442
- So, will you celebrate tonight?
- Of course.

526
01:28:11,458 --> 01:28:18,298
- I think she likes us.
- In time she'll get used to it.

527
01:28:18,465 --> 01:28:22,136
- What was he like?
- Just a cop.

528
01:28:22,302 --> 01:28:25,472
- Did you get his name?
- No.

529
01:28:25,639 --> 01:28:29,560
- He'll be back.
- They have their man. It's over.

530
01:28:29,726 --> 01:28:33,230
No, it's not. I have to meet him.

531
01:29:00,507 --> 01:29:03,177
Vincent?

532
01:29:12,019 --> 01:29:15,439
My God, you have changed.

533
01:29:17,691 --> 01:29:22,488
- Don't you recognize your brother?
- Are we brothers?

534
01:29:22,696 --> 01:29:28,702
Our parents died thinking they'd
outlived you. I had my doubts.

535
01:29:29,661 --> 01:29:35,042
<i>- What are you doing here?
- I have a right to be here.</i>

536
01:29:36,001 --> 01:29:42,007
- You don't.
- You sound as if you believe that.

537
01:29:42,174 --> 01:29:46,887
I committed no murder.
You must be disappointed.

538
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:54,102
You committed fraud. You're in
trouble. I can get you out of here.

539
01:29:54,311 --> 01:29:59,817
- I've struggled to get here!
- You've gone as far as you can go.

540
01:30:00,818 --> 01:30:03,987
There's still a million miles to go.

541
01:30:04,154 --> 01:30:07,741
Can you only succeed
by seeing me fail?

542
01:30:07,908 --> 01:30:13,580
God! Even you are going to tell me
what I can and can't do now?

543
01:30:13,747 --> 01:30:20,337
I don't need any rescuing.
But you did, once.

544
01:30:22,422 --> 01:30:29,096
- How do you explain that?
- You didn't beat me. I beat myself.

545
01:30:31,014 --> 01:30:35,269
- Who are you trying to convince?
- Do you want me to prove it?

546
01:30:36,186 --> 01:30:41,150
It's not important, Anton.
It's forgotten.

547
01:30:41,316 --> 01:30:45,404
I'll prove it to you.
Do you want me to prove it?

548
01:30:45,571 --> 01:30:47,197
I do.

549
01:31:52,888 --> 01:31:55,349
Vincent!

550
01:31:55,974 --> 01:32:00,020
Vincent! Where's the shore?
We're too far out!

551
01:32:00,187 --> 01:32:03,357
Do you want to quit? Do you?

552
01:32:05,192 --> 01:32:07,653
No.

553
01:32:29,591 --> 01:32:34,972
Vincent!
How are you doing this, Vincent?

554
01:32:35,764 --> 01:32:39,768
How have you done any of this?
We have to go back.

555
01:32:39,935 --> 01:32:45,732
- No. We're close to the other side.
- Do you want to drown us both?

556
01:32:47,192 --> 01:32:49,945
You want to know how I did it?

557
01:32:50,112 --> 01:32:56,076
This is how I did it. I never
saved anything for the swim back.

558
01:34:39,513 --> 01:34:45,144
You couldn't see, could you?
That night, crossing the street.

559
01:34:46,812 --> 01:34:50,732
You crossed anyway.

560
01:35:04,413 --> 01:35:09,710
If you're still interested,
let me know.

561
01:35:15,090 --> 01:35:18,093
<i>Sorry ...</i>

562
01:35:21,138 --> 01:35:25,684
The wind caught it.

563
01:36:17,110 --> 01:36:23,116
You're flying today, aren't you?
Look at what a mess you're in.

564
01:36:25,619 --> 01:36:31,875
- I have your samples ready.
- I don't need any where I'm going.

565
01:36:36,255 --> 01:36:39,675
You might when you get back.

566
01:36:41,802 --> 01:36:46,431
Everything you need
to last you two lifetimes.

567
01:36:47,975 --> 01:36:53,981
- Why have you done all this?
- So Jerome will always be here.

568
01:36:54,189 --> 01:36:59,319
- Where are you going?
- I'm travelling, too.

569
01:37:01,530 --> 01:37:07,619
<i>- I don't know how to thank you.
- No, no ...</i>

570
01:37:07,828 --> 01:37:13,750
I got the better end of the deal.
I only lent you my body.

571
01:37:13,917 --> 01:37:17,754
You lent me your dream.

572
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:30,517
Not until you're upstairs.

573
01:38:02,007 --> 01:38:06,386
- What is this?
- New policy.

574
01:38:12,059 --> 01:38:17,022
- Flight got you nervous?
- There's a problem, Lamar.

575
01:38:17,189 --> 01:38:23,153
I never did tell you about my son,
did I? He's a big fan of yours.

576
01:38:26,156 --> 01:38:31,745
Just remember that I was as good
as any and better than most.

577
01:38:31,912 --> 01:38:38,001
- He wants to apply here.
- I could have gone up and back.

578
01:38:38,836 --> 01:38:44,216
Unfortunately, my son's
not all that they promised.

579
01:38:44,383 --> 01:38:49,096
But then,
who knows what he could do?

580
01:38:49,263 --> 01:38:52,349
Right?

581
01:39:06,697 --> 01:39:12,953
For future reference, right-handed
men don't hold it with their left.

582
01:39:13,162 --> 01:39:17,082
Just one of those things.

583
01:39:28,177 --> 01:39:33,390
You're going to miss your flight,
Vincent.

584
01:42:16,804 --> 01:42:21,141
<i>For someone who was never meant
for this world, -</i>

585
01:42:21,308 --> 01:42:25,979
<i>- I'm suddenly having a hard time
leaving it.</i>

586
01:42:26,146 --> 01:42:31,276
<i>Of course, they say every atom in
our bodies was once part of a star.</i>

587
01:42:31,485 --> 01:42:37,574
<i>Maybe I'm not leaving.
Maybe I'm going home.</i>
