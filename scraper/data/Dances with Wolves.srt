1
00:01:29,779 --> 00:01:32,699
- Is this the last one?
- I don't know.

2
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:34,784
There's no ether, either.

3
00:01:34,868 --> 00:01:36,536
Jesus Christ.

4
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,789
You there! Is this the last one?

5
00:01:47,005 --> 00:01:48,632
God, what a mess.

6
00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:51,801
At least there's no gangrene.

7
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:54,721
There will be 
if it doesn't come off soon.

8
00:01:54,804 --> 00:01:57,766
I can't saw 
if I can't keep my eyes open.

9
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:00,602
I'm sorry.

10
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,065
Let's coffee up. 
He can wait a few more minutes.

11
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:19,389
God!

12
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:47,811
Glass.

13
00:04:50,605 --> 00:04:53,441
- Is that Tucker's men?
- Yes, sir. I think it is.

14
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,652
How long has it been like this?

15
00:04:55,735 --> 00:04:59,614
We found 'em this morning, sir.
They've been here for two days.

16
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,960
Is that you, Lieutenant?

17
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,048
Sons of bitches.

18
00:05:20,218 --> 00:05:23,054
Come on. You better take cover.

19
00:05:24,347 --> 00:05:27,893
I ain't kidding. These boys are 
shooters. Come on. Go under cover.

20
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,020
There you go.

21
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,862
You went to the hospital?

22
00:05:40,488 --> 00:05:41,990
It was no good.

23
00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:47,412
What's going on here?

24
00:05:47,787 --> 00:05:49,539
What's going on here?

25
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:52,500
That seems to be 
the question, all right.

26
00:05:53,251 --> 00:05:55,378
See, you could ask the major ...

27
00:05:56,213 --> 00:05:57,756
but he don't know.

28
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,174
He's busy.

29
00:05:59,257 --> 00:06:02,135
He's busy trying to figure out
how come the officers' mess ...

30
00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:04,221
run out of peach ice cream.

31
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,015
Then, of course, you got the general.

32
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:09,309
He come up to see the show.

33
00:06:09,392 --> 00:06:11,436
All he knows is there ain't no show ...

34
00:06:11,603 --> 00:06:14,648
which ain't entirely correct
'cause we started a balloon up ...

35
00:06:14,731 --> 00:06:17,400
but they shot her down
before we got off the ground.

36
00:06:17,484 --> 00:06:21,071
Nobody's made a run either way.
It's been a standoff all damned day.

37
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,159
Now, the major, 
he's looking at the general.

38
00:06:27,285 --> 00:06:30,455
He's thinking to himself,
"I better do something."

39
00:06:30,622 --> 00:06:32,123
You know what that means.

40
00:06:32,207 --> 00:06:35,335
I sure as hell don't want to be
the first one across this field.

41
00:06:36,044 --> 00:06:38,922
They're supposed to be 
beat up just like us.

42
00:06:39,172 --> 00:06:42,509
Hell, everybody knows
Tucker's men are tough as cobs.

43
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:46,763
So far, the only thing been killed 
out here is three milking cows.

44
00:06:48,056 --> 00:06:49,933
Course, that's about to change.

45
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,731
You son of a bitch.

46
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:02,153
You know, some of the boys are saying
if we ain't gonna fight ...

47
00:07:03,405 --> 00:07:06,241
we could just settle this whole 
business with a little ...

48
00:07:06,283 --> 00:07:08,076
high-stakes poker.

49
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:10,078
Wouldn't that be a sight?

50
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:13,623
A bunch of fellas sitting in 
the middle of this field ...

51
00:07:13,707 --> 00:07:15,000
drawing cards.

52
00:07:24,342 --> 00:07:25,886
What is it, sir?

53
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:27,429
Looks like a suicide.

54
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:29,431
Tucker!

55
00:07:41,985 --> 00:07:43,570
What's he doing?

56
00:08:10,347 --> 00:08:13,433
- What did you say to him?
- I didn't say nothing.

57
00:08:37,707 --> 00:08:39,626
Come on back, you son of a bitch!

58
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:45,006
- You won't make it no second time!
- All right by me.

59
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,220
Forgive me, Father.

60
00:08:54,307 --> 00:08:56,935
- He's coming back again!
- Here he comes, boys!

61
00:09:31,595 --> 00:09:33,722
- Ready!
- I got him.

62
00:11:17,993 --> 00:11:19,202
Don't ...

63
00:11:21,663 --> 00:11:23,290
Don't take off my foot.

64
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,585
You rest easy, son. 
You'll keep your foot.

65
00:11:27,043 --> 00:11:29,588
With God as my judge, you'll keep it.

66
00:11:34,676 --> 00:11:36,803
- Bring up my ambulance.
- Sir?

67
00:11:37,304 --> 00:11:40,140
Bring up my ambulance,
and bring my surgeon with it!

68
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:44,644
We got an officer
who's worth something lying here.

69
00:12:12,214 --> 00:12:14,716
"The strangeness of this life
cannot be measured.

70
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,551
"In trying to produce my own death ...

71
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,429
"I was elevated to the status 
of a living hero.

72
00:12:19,512 --> 00:12:21,389
"I was also awarded Cisco ...

73
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:24,434
"the trusty mount that carried
me across the field that day.

74
00:12:24,517 --> 00:12:28,438
"And on full recovery, was given 
transfer to any station I desired.

75
00:12:28,688 --> 00:12:32,442
"The bloody slaughter continues in 
the east as I arrive at Fort Hayes.

76
00:12:32,526 --> 00:12:37,239
"A tiny island of men and material
surrounded by a never-ending sea of prairie."

77
00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:36,506
Lieutenant.

78
00:13:58,528 --> 00:14:00,739
Where can I find Maj. Fambrough?

79
00:14:00,822 --> 00:14:02,407
Down at the end of the hall.

80
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,825
Thank you.

81
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,503
"Lt. John J. Dunbar."

82
00:14:20,342 --> 00:14:22,219
Lt. John J. Dunbar?

83
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,930
- Yes, sir.
- "Yes, sir."

84
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:27,933
Indian fighter.

85
00:14:29,017 --> 00:14:30,185
Excuse me?

86
00:14:30,227 --> 00:14:32,771
It says here that you're
to be posted on the frontier.

87
00:14:32,854 --> 00:14:34,189
The frontier is Indian country.

88
00:14:34,272 --> 00:14:36,775
I quickly deduced that 
you're an Indian fighter.

89
00:14:36,858 --> 00:14:39,486
I did not ascend to this 
position by being stupid.

90
00:14:39,528 --> 00:14:41,446
- No, sir.
- "No, sir."

91
00:14:46,368 --> 00:14:49,663
It says here that 
you've been decorated.

92
00:14:49,746 --> 00:14:51,039
Yes, sir.

93
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,877
And they sent you here to be posted?

94
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:58,672
Actually, sir, 
I'm here at my own request.

95
00:14:58,713 --> 00:15:00,632
Really? Why?

96
00:15:01,675 --> 00:15:04,302
I've always wanted 
to see the frontier.

97
00:15:04,511 --> 00:15:06,388
You want to see the frontier?

98
00:15:07,264 --> 00:15:08,557
Yes, sir.

99
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,058
Before it's gone.

100
00:15:16,857 --> 00:15:19,568
Such a smart lad, 
coming straight to me.

101
00:15:26,116 --> 00:15:27,242
Sir ...

102
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,077
Knight.

103
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:33,164
I am sending you on a knight's errand.

104
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,751
You will report to Captain Cargill ...

105
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:39,796
at the furthermost 
outpost of the realm ...

106
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:41,965
Fort Sedgewick.

107
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:47,178
My personal seal 
will assure your safety ...

108
00:15:47,762 --> 00:15:50,807
through many miles
of wild and hostile country.

109
00:16:00,775 --> 00:16:02,777
- I was wondering ...
- Yes?

110
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:06,948
I was wondering, sir, 
how will I be getting there?

111
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:09,659
You think I don't know?

112
00:16:09,743 --> 00:16:11,745
- No, sir.
- You think that.

113
00:16:11,828 --> 00:16:14,039
- It's just that I don't know —
- Hold your tongue.

114
00:16:14,122 --> 00:16:16,708
I am in a generous mood
and I will grant your boon.

115
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,835
See that peasant out there?

116
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:20,754
He calls himself Timmons.

117
00:16:20,795 --> 00:16:24,758
He's going there this very afternoon.
You can ride with him if you like.

118
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,386
He knows the way. 
Thank you. That is all.

119
00:16:41,107 --> 00:16:42,484
Sir Knight?

120
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:48,532
I've just pissed in my pants ...

121
00:16:50,617 --> 00:16:53,119
and nobody can do anything about it.

122
00:17:07,676 --> 00:17:09,302
To your journey!

123
00:17:14,224 --> 00:17:15,725
To my journey!

124
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:34,619
Haw!

125
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:39,082
Over a little bit, Jim!

126
00:17:41,793 --> 00:17:43,461
- Have this by tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

127
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:45,463
I'll have my crown now.

128
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,718
- Sir?
- I'll have my crown now!

129
00:17:51,553 --> 00:17:53,972
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Are you deaf, fool?

130
00:17:54,055 --> 00:17:56,474
I said I'll have my crown right now!

131
00:17:56,558 --> 00:17:57,642
Now!

132
00:18:02,022 --> 00:18:03,023
No.

133
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:06,359
- I'll get your crown.
- No.

134
00:18:16,578 --> 00:18:17,579
Sir?

135
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,457
Major?

136
00:18:25,086 --> 00:18:26,713
The king is dead.

137
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:33,261
Long live the king.

138
00:18:57,244 --> 00:18:59,621
Get these kids out of here, come on!

139
00:19:15,303 --> 00:19:16,972
Haw, Jim and Jake!

140
00:19:21,476 --> 00:19:23,520
Gee a little bit, Jim!

141
00:21:04,246 --> 00:21:05,580
The hell was that?

142
00:21:06,998 --> 00:21:08,458
What is that?

143
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:15,966
What the hell is that?

144
00:21:41,157 --> 00:21:43,618
Why don't you put that in your book?

145
00:21:53,336 --> 00:21:54,880
"Were it not for my companion ...

146
00:21:54,963 --> 00:21:57,591
"I believe I would be having 
the time of my life.

147
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,050
"I know he means well ...

148
00:21:59,134 --> 00:22:02,429
"but he is quite possibly
the foulest man I have ever met."

149
00:22:37,297 --> 00:22:39,299
How far you make the Fort?

150
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:40,800
Far.

151
00:22:43,845 --> 00:22:44,846
How far?

152
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:47,807
Forty, fifty mile, maybe.

153
00:22:48,683 --> 00:22:51,019
What's the big hurry on Sedgewick?

154
00:22:51,853 --> 00:22:53,605
It's to be my post.

155
00:22:54,898 --> 00:22:56,149
My home.

156
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,032
You ain't hard to please, 
I'll give you that much.

157
00:23:09,371 --> 00:23:10,789
Look yonder.

158
00:23:22,175 --> 00:23:23,885
What you got there?

159
00:23:35,188 --> 00:23:38,441
Somebody back east is saying,
"Why don't she write?"

160
00:23:40,902 --> 00:23:42,612
You stupid bastard.

161
00:24:58,313 --> 00:24:59,898
Get up, Timmons.

162
00:25:03,818 --> 00:25:05,028
Get up.

163
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:19,626
Get up.

164
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,379
Come on. Get up.

165
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:28,343
Get up!

166
00:25:34,224 --> 00:25:37,143
Someone poked me in my butt. 
Was that you?

167
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:38,895
Goddamn it!

168
00:25:41,314 --> 00:25:43,108
I'm gonna have a welt.

169
00:26:57,766 --> 00:26:59,351
Cpl. Guest?

170
00:27:12,614 --> 00:27:15,283
You don't have to talk to me,
just please come out.

171
00:27:36,513 --> 00:27:37,806
It's the end.

172
00:27:39,307 --> 00:27:42,102
Assemble the men 
in front of my quarters.

173
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:53,655
You hate me.

174
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:58,076
But I feel none of the same for you.

175
00:27:59,953 --> 00:28:01,496
You men stayed.

176
00:28:04,165 --> 00:28:07,002
You stayed after 
they took all our horses.

177
00:28:09,212 --> 00:28:11,715
You stayed after 
all the others deserted.

178
00:28:13,675 --> 00:28:16,720
You stayed after the army 
failed to re-supply us.

179
00:28:20,557 --> 00:28:23,435
I have looked for that wagon 
from Fort Hayes ...

180
00:28:23,643 --> 00:28:25,103
just as you have ...

181
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,522
day after miserable day.

182
00:28:30,692 --> 00:28:33,320
And all I can say 
is that I'm proud of you.

183
00:28:35,197 --> 00:28:38,450
Now get your things, men.
We're leaving this place.

184
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:41,036
The army can go to hell.

185
00:28:45,332 --> 00:28:46,333
Go.

186
00:28:46,583 --> 00:28:48,168
Get your things.

187
00:29:27,749 --> 00:29:30,293
How come we haven't seen any buffalo?

188
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,754
You can't figure the stinking buffalo.

189
00:29:33,213 --> 00:29:36,132
You can't. Sometimes you 
won't see any for days.

190
00:29:36,216 --> 00:29:39,553
Other times, they'll be thick,
like curls on a whore.

191
00:29:42,931 --> 00:29:44,266
What about Indians?

192
00:29:44,307 --> 00:29:46,685
Indians? Goddamn Indians!

193
00:29:47,102 --> 00:29:50,605
You just as soon not see 'em
unless the bastards are dead.

194
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:53,149
They're nothing 
but thieves and beggars.

195
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:54,860
Ho, up there!

196
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:27,536
Not what you would call
much of a going concern now, is it?

197
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,583
Go down there.

198
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:36,711
- Why? There ain't nothing down there.
- Because I said.

199
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:39,381
Go down there.

200
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,179
There, son of a bitch!

201
00:32:12,747 --> 00:32:14,708
There ain't nothing here, Lieutenant.

202
00:32:35,395 --> 00:32:37,731
There ain't nothing here, Lieutenant.

203
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:43,904
Lieutenant!

204
00:32:45,447 --> 00:32:47,574
Everybody's run off or got killed.

205
00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:09,179
All right. Let's unload the wagon.

206
00:33:09,846 --> 00:33:12,182
What? What, and leave it all here?

207
00:33:13,808 --> 00:33:15,435
I'm staying, too.

208
00:33:15,977 --> 00:33:17,854
There ain't nothing here.

209
00:33:18,521 --> 00:33:20,982
No, not at the moment.

210
00:33:21,483 --> 00:33:23,443
We don't know what's happened.

211
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,781
Things being as they are ...

212
00:33:28,532 --> 00:33:31,618
we might as well just turn 
around and get headed back.

213
00:33:31,826 --> 00:33:33,161
This is my post.

214
00:33:33,203 --> 00:33:34,496
"This is my post?"

215
00:33:34,663 --> 00:33:36,248
This is my post.

216
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:39,501
"This is my post?"

217
00:33:39,793 --> 00:33:41,211
Jesus H. Christ.

218
00:33:41,294 --> 00:33:42,963
What, are you crazy, boy?

219
00:33:46,508 --> 00:33:48,301
Fast son of a bitch.

220
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,137
- Jesus H. Christ.
- This is my post.

221
00:33:51,221 --> 00:33:52,681
All right, put it down.

222
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:56,518
And these are the post provisions, all right?
Now get your ass off the wagon —

223
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,687
- Put it down!
- And help me unload.

224
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,523
We're just havin' a conversation,
now put it down.

225
00:34:52,616 --> 00:34:54,951
I'll let them know where you are.

226
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:56,703
Good.

227
00:34:59,247 --> 00:35:00,582
Good luck.

228
00:35:02,792 --> 00:35:04,002
Thank you.

229
00:35:08,381 --> 00:35:09,841
Jake and Jim!

230
00:35:21,144 --> 00:35:22,646
Good mule!

231
00:35:23,563 --> 00:35:24,814
Haw up there now!

232
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,304
Good mules!

"Have arrived to find 
Fort Sedgewick deserted.

254
00:42:27,863 --> 00:42:29,948
Come on, Cisco. One more time.

255
00:42:30,031 --> 00:42:31,199
Git up!

256
00:42:32,284 --> 00:42:34,202
Come on! Git up, Cisco.

257
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:38,999
Git up!

258

Git up! There you go!

259

Easy.

260
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:26,922
Only a white man would make 
a fire for everyone to see.

261
00:43:27,797 --> 00:43:30,383
Maybe there's more than one.

262
00:43:30,467 --> 00:43:33,053
There might be three or four.

263
00:43:33,929 --> 00:43:35,472
I know three or four ...

264
00:43:35,555 --> 00:43:38,016
who will not be making 
the trip back home.

265
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:41,102
We have nothing to show for this trail.

266
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,272
We have no rifles.

267
00:43:44,356 --> 00:43:46,566
White men are sure to have rifles.

268
00:43:47,943 --> 00:43:51,696
It's hard to say 
how many might be down there.

269
00:43:58,787 --> 00:44:01,373
We should forget this and go home.

270
00:44:01,915 --> 00:44:03,291
Then go.

271
00:44:04,084 --> 00:44:06,086
I would rather die ...

272
00:44:06,127 --> 00:44:09,923
than argue about a single line 
of smoke in my own country.

273
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:24,104
He will not quit until we are all dead.

Don't hurt my mules.

277
00:46:05,205 --> 00:46:06,414
Stop.

278
00:46:06,748 --> 00:46:07,749
Stop it.

324
00:55:58,798 --> 00:56:01,509
"Have made first contact 
with a wild Indian.

325
00:56:01,593 --> 00:56:04,763
"One came to the fort
and tried to steal my horse.

326
00:56:04,888 --> 00:56:07,599
"When I appeared, he became 
frightened and ran off.

327
00:56:08,391 --> 00:56:12,520
"Have decided to bury excess ordnance
lest it fall into enemy hands.

328
00:56:12,646 --> 00:56:15,732
"Keeping only the barest 
necessities for myself.

329
00:56:21,071 --> 00:56:24,449
"My afternoon rides have been pared 
down to short circular patrols ...

330
00:56:24,533 --> 00:56:26,701
"always keeping the post in sight.

331
00:56:27,577 --> 00:56:30,830
"Am taking steps to prepare
for another visitation.

332
00:56:30,956 --> 00:56:33,500
"Do not know how many more
might be in the vicinity ...

333
00:56:33,542 --> 00:56:37,045
"but am assuming that where there 
is one there's sure to be another.

334
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:42,842
"Most of my work has been geared
toward creating the illusion ...

335
00:56:42,926 --> 00:56:44,803
"of strength and stability.

336
00:56:46,012 --> 00:56:49,558
"I'm still alone, however,
and unless troops arrive soon ...

337
00:56:49,641 --> 00:56:51,184
"all may be lost."

338
00:57:07,242 --> 00:57:11,371
'Kicking Bird' has been keeping 
to himself these last few days.

339
00:57:12,914 --> 00:57:17,002
I do not like to see our 
medicine man walking so alone.

340
00:57:19,296 --> 00:57:21,590
What does his wife say?

341
00:57:21,673 --> 00:57:24,384
She says that he is 
keeping to himself.

342
00:57:24,551 --> 00:57:26,970
That's not what I asked you.

343
00:57:27,053 --> 00:57:28,680
Well, what did you ask me?

344
00:57:28,763 --> 00:57:30,849
What did she say?

345
00:57:30,932 --> 00:57:34,144
She said that he is keeping
to himself these days.

346
00:57:35,395 --> 00:57:37,397
That's what she says.

347
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:41,693
Make sure that my meat is soft.

348
00:57:41,776 --> 00:57:44,112
My teeth hurt.

349
00:57:54,206 --> 00:57:56,249
May I come in?

350
00:58:07,469 --> 00:58:11,932
No, let him sit with me.

351
00:58:16,353 --> 00:58:19,898
Our country seems good 
this summer ...

352
00:58:19,981 --> 00:58:24,402
but I have not been out to see it.

353
00:58:25,654 --> 00:58:29,282
But the buffalo are late.

354
00:58:29,324 --> 00:58:32,953
And I always worry about 
the bellies of our children.

355
00:58:35,914 --> 00:58:38,625
I was thinking of a dance.

356
00:58:38,708 --> 00:58:42,504
Yes. A dance is always a good idea.

357
00:58:42,587 --> 00:58:47,842
It would be good to have a strong sign.

358
00:59:02,524 --> 00:59:05,694
There's a funny thing about signs.

359
00:59:05,777 --> 00:59:08,363
We know when they are bad or good.

360
00:59:09,698 --> 00:59:14,160
Sometimes they are strange
and it's hard to understand them.

361
00:59:14,202 --> 00:59:17,038
A smart man will think 
on these things.

362
00:59:18,164 --> 00:59:22,168
If he is still confused, 
he will tell somebody.

363
00:59:22,711 --> 00:59:24,838
For instance, 
he might tell you or me.

364
00:59:24,921 --> 00:59:26,882
A smart man always does this.

365
00:59:32,554 --> 00:59:35,390
I have seen such a sign.

366
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:37,934
Really?

367
00:59:51,907 --> 00:59:54,367
I saw a man.

368
00:59:54,409 --> 00:59:57,495
A naked, white man.

369
00:59:57,579 --> 00:59:59,206
Are you sure it was a man?

370
01:00:01,499 --> 01:00:03,627
I saw his sex.

371
01:00:05,962 --> 01:00:07,505
Did you speak to him?

372
01:00:10,258 --> 01:00:11,384
No.

373
01:00:26,399 --> 01:00:28,777
"It's been two days now, and nothing.

374
01:00:28,818 --> 01:00:31,905
"My presence here must
have been reported by now.

375
01:00:31,947 --> 01:00:34,866
"Have made all the preparations 
I can think of.

376
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:37,452
"Cannot mount an adequate defense
as I am still alone.

377
01:00:37,536 --> 01:00:40,205
"But will try to make
a big impression when they come.

378
01:00:40,372 --> 01:00:41,581
"Waiting.

379
01:00:42,082 --> 01:00:43,375
"Post-script ...

380
01:00:43,458 --> 01:00:46,920
"The man I encountered was
a magnificent-looking fellow."

381
01:00:57,764 --> 01:01:01,643
He might be a god.

382
01:01:01,685 --> 01:01:06,606
Or a white chief 
with special abilities.

383
01:01:06,648 --> 01:01:09,025
That is why we should talk with him.

384
01:01:11,695 --> 01:01:14,447
I do not care for this 
talk about this white man.

385
01:01:14,531 --> 01:01:18,368
Whatever he is, he is not a Sioux,
and that makes him less.

386
01:01:18,451 --> 01:01:22,831
When I hear that more whites 
are coming, I want to laugh.

387
01:01:22,873 --> 01:01:25,208
We took a hundred horses 
from these people.

388
01:01:25,292 --> 01:01:27,669
There was no honor in it.

389
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:30,463
They don't ride well. 
They don't shoot well.

390
01:01:30,505 --> 01:01:33,341
They're dirty.

391
01:01:33,383 --> 01:01:37,178
Those soldiers could not even 
make it through one winter here.

392
01:01:38,346 --> 01:01:40,223
And these people are said to flourish?

393
01:01:40,307 --> 01:01:42,809
I think they will all be dead soon.

394
01:01:45,228 --> 01:01:48,899
I think this fool is probably lost.

395
01:01:54,362 --> 01:01:57,949
'Wind In His Hair's' words are 
strong and I have heard them.

396
01:01:58,033 --> 01:02:00,994
It's true "The Whites" are a 
poor race and hard to understand.

397
01:02:01,953 --> 01:02:04,456
But make no mistake. 
"The Whites" are coming.

398
01:02:04,539 --> 01:02:06,666
Even our enemies agree on this.

399
01:02:06,708 --> 01:02:10,378
So when I see one man alone
without fear in our country ...

400
01:02:10,462 --> 01:02:15,217
I do not think he is lost.
I think he may have medicine.

401
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:18,720
I see someone who might speak ...

402
01:02:18,803 --> 01:02:22,057
for all the white people 
who are coming.

403
01:02:22,098 --> 01:02:26,436
I think this is a person
with which treaties might be struck.

404
01:02:28,897 --> 01:02:35,737
'Kicking Bird' is always looking 
ahead and that is good.

405
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:39,991
But this man cannot cover our 
lodges or feed our children.

406
01:02:40,075 --> 01:02:43,828
He is nothing to us.

407
01:02:43,912 --> 01:02:45,664
I will take some men.

408
01:02:45,747 --> 01:02:47,874
We will shoot some arrows 
into this white man.

409
01:02:47,916 --> 01:02:51,545
If he truly has medicine, 
he will not be hurt.

410
01:02:51,628 --> 01:02:54,381
If he has no medicine, 
he will be dead.

411
01:02:59,761 --> 01:03:03,306
No man can tell another what to do.

412
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:06,768
But killing a white man 
is a delicate matter.

413
01:03:06,851 --> 01:03:10,897
If you kill one, 
more are sure to come.

414
01:03:16,278 --> 01:03:20,907
It's easy to become confused
by these questions.

415
01:03:20,991 --> 01:03:23,535
It's hard to know what to do.

416
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:29,040
We should talk about this some more.

417
01:03:30,083 --> 01:03:32,878
That is all I have to say.

418
01:04:08,455 --> 01:04:09,831
What's the matter, now?

419
01:04:09,915 --> 01:04:12,584
We don't think this is 
such a good idea.

420
01:04:13,793 --> 01:04:15,670
If we take the horse 
of a white god ...

421
01:04:15,712 --> 01:04:17,964
they will make up songs about us.

422
01:04:19,007 --> 01:04:19,966
Maybe.

423
01:04:21,134 --> 01:04:23,386
They will ask us to go on raids.

424
01:04:23,470 --> 01:04:26,473
Who gets the horse?

425
01:04:26,556 --> 01:04:27,557
I do.

426
01:04:28,725 --> 01:04:33,980
I do, but we share. Now who can say
this is not a great plan?

427
01:04:38,026 --> 01:04:40,237
It's always the same.

428
01:04:41,071 --> 01:04:42,822
Every time.

429
01:04:49,204 --> 01:04:51,706
Yes, sir, I have. 
No, I'll ask, sir.

430
01:05:16,356 --> 01:05:18,692
We'll be heroes.

431
01:05:21,778 --> 01:05:24,030
They'll write songs about us.

432
01:05:36,751 --> 01:05:39,212
What happened?

433
01:05:43,425 --> 01:05:47,554
I don't know. My arm doesn't work.

434
01:05:50,223 --> 01:05:53,894
You shouldn't have fallen off.
Now we'll get in trouble.

435
01:05:54,477 --> 01:05:56,563
It was your idea.

436
01:05:56,646 --> 01:06:02,110
My idea was only to take the horse,
not fall down.

437
01:06:06,698 --> 01:06:08,742
Otter hurt himself.

438
01:06:11,953 --> 01:06:13,955
What are you looking at?
I'm the one who's hurt.

439
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:18,460
I will be when my father finds out.
His bow will be across my back.

440
01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:45,315
I am 'Wind In His Hair'.

441
01:08:46,441 --> 01:08:48,944
I am 'Wind In His Hair'.

442
01:08:49,945 --> 01:08:53,365
Do you see that 
I am not afraid of you?

443
01:08:53,615 --> 01:08:55,075
Do you see?

444
01:10:08,273 --> 01:10:11,693
The party that went against 
"The Utes" is coming back.

445
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,822
There are many hearts on the ground.

446
01:11:51,251 --> 01:11:53,628
"I realize now that I have been wrong.

447
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:55,630
"All this time, I've been waiting.

448
01:11:55,714 --> 01:11:57,257
"Waiting for what?

449
01:11:57,299 --> 01:11:58,800
"For someone to find me?

450
01:11:58,884 --> 01:12:00,719
"For Indians to take my horse?

451
01:12:00,802 --> 01:12:02,429
"To see a buffalo?

452
01:12:02,512 --> 01:12:05,807
"Since I have arrived at this post
I have been walking on eggs.

453
01:12:05,891 --> 01:12:08,727
"It has become a bad habit 
and I am sick of it.

454
01:12:08,810 --> 01:12:11,229
"Tomorrow morning,
I will ride out to the Indians.

455
01:12:11,313 --> 01:12:13,899
"I do not know the outcome
or wisdom of this thinking ...

456
01:12:13,982 --> 01:12:17,569
"but I've become a target and 
a target makes a poor impression.

457
01:12:17,652 --> 01:12:19,446
"I am through waiting."

458
01:12:20,530 --> 01:12:22,449
What are you looking at?

459
01:13:53,248 --> 01:13:54,791
Son of a bitch!

460
01:14:07,804 --> 01:14:09,055
No. Wait.

461
01:14:10,098 --> 01:14:11,224
Wait.

462
01:14:13,685 --> 01:14:14,728
Wait.

463
01:14:18,064 --> 01:14:19,774
You need help. You're hurt.

464
01:14:19,858 --> 01:14:21,902
- You need —
- No!

465
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:26,406
Let me ... You need help.

466
01:14:26,698 --> 01:14:29,743
You need help. 
You're hurt. Let me help you.

467
01:14:34,247 --> 01:14:35,624
You're hurt.

468
01:14:40,795 --> 01:14:41,963
Don't.

469
01:18:01,162 --> 01:18:02,539
She's hurt.

470
01:18:09,087 --> 01:18:10,422
She's hurt.

471
01:18:21,433 --> 01:18:23,768
You are not welcome here.

472
01:18:27,439 --> 01:18:29,774
No. She's hurt.

473
01:18:31,902 --> 01:18:34,362
Go away from us.

474
01:18:42,829 --> 01:18:46,291
You are not welcome. 
Go away from us.

475
01:19:28,625 --> 01:19:30,585
Stop.

476
01:19:30,669 --> 01:19:33,880
The soldier did not come to fight.

477
01:19:33,964 --> 01:19:37,217
He is going away and we will let him.

478
01:20:02,784 --> 01:20:06,037
I am in agreement with 'Kicking Bird'.

479
01:20:06,913 --> 01:20:09,583
We will go down and talk to the white man.

480
01:20:10,709 --> 01:20:13,670
And find out why he is here.

481
01:20:23,305 --> 01:20:25,849
If this council decides 
to talk to the white man ...

482
01:20:25,932 --> 01:20:28,143
then it will be so.

483
01:20:28,226 --> 01:20:30,186
But in my mind it's not right ...

484
01:20:30,228 --> 01:20:32,063
that a chief as great as 'Ten Bears' ...

485
01:20:32,147 --> 01:20:35,275
goes to ask the business of a puny,
trespassing white man ...

486
01:20:35,358 --> 01:20:40,071
who has only a smart horse
and a few white man's clothes.

487
01:20:41,823 --> 01:20:43,533
I will not go.

488
01:20:44,326 --> 01:20:46,244
You will go.

489
01:20:51,791 --> 01:20:54,127
And you will go.

490
01:20:55,253 --> 01:20:58,173
That is all I have to say.

491
01:21:18,777 --> 01:21:19,986
Welcome.

492
01:21:20,946 --> 01:21:22,197
Welcome.

493
01:21:24,449 --> 01:21:25,408
Hi!

494
01:21:32,624 --> 01:21:33,708
Come.

495
01:21:34,584 --> 01:21:36,211
Please, sit down.

496
01:21:37,128 --> 01:21:38,296
Sit down.

497
01:22:03,154 --> 01:22:05,240
Wait just a ... Just a minute.

498
01:22:10,370 --> 01:22:12,414
His mind is gone.

499
01:22:40,358 --> 01:22:42,027
Tatanka. Buffalo.

500
01:22:43,028 --> 01:22:44,863
- Buffalo.
- Tatanka.

501
01:22:52,537 --> 01:22:54,206
Buffalo. Tatanka.

502
01:22:56,958 --> 01:23:00,295
"The fierce one, as I call him,
seems a very tough fellow.

503
01:23:00,378 --> 01:23:02,214
"I hope I never have to fight him.

504
01:23:02,297 --> 01:23:05,884
"From the little I know,
he seems to be honest and very direct.

505
01:23:05,967 --> 01:23:08,178
"I like the quiet one immensely.

506
01:23:08,261 --> 01:23:10,180
"He's been patient and inquisitive.

507
01:23:10,222 --> 01:23:12,349
"He seems eager to communicate.

508
01:23:12,432 --> 01:23:15,685
"I would conclude that he is a man
of some weight among his people."

509
01:23:15,769 --> 01:23:17,020
Buffalo.

510
01:23:25,153 --> 01:23:28,365
"I believe I made an even greater 
impression on their next visit.

511
01:23:28,406 --> 01:23:32,661
"I produced a coffee grinder,
something none of them had seen before."

512
01:24:14,786 --> 01:24:16,162
Is the coffee not good?

513
01:24:17,455 --> 01:24:19,040
It's too strong, maybe.

514
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:23,128
Sugar.

515
01:24:24,296 --> 01:24:25,463
Put in.

516
01:24:35,265 --> 01:24:36,516
Taste it.

517
01:24:47,861 --> 01:24:49,029
Sugar.

518
01:24:50,071 --> 01:24:51,573
You want some?

519
01:24:52,157 --> 01:24:53,617
You want some?

520
01:24:59,664 --> 01:25:01,124
That's a lot.

521
01:25:07,505 --> 01:25:08,506
Okay.

522
01:25:09,257 --> 01:25:10,258
Yeah.

523
01:25:14,721 --> 01:25:17,057
"It's good to finally 
have some company.

524
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:20,101
"So much goes unsaid and I have 
the feeling that these people ...

525
01:25:20,185 --> 01:25:23,021
"the quiet one in particular,
want something from me.

526
01:25:23,104 --> 01:25:25,482
"Made presents of coffee
and most of the sugar.

527
01:25:25,524 --> 01:25:27,817
"It didn't figure to last anyway.

528
01:25:27,901 --> 01:25:29,736
"Don't believe I go 
too far in saying ...

529
01:25:29,819 --> 01:25:32,614
"that a foundation
for good relations is being laid."

530
01:26:07,732 --> 01:26:10,277
'Stands With A Fist'.

531
01:26:13,989 --> 01:26:16,575
We will talk awhile.

532
01:26:25,083 --> 01:26:28,044
Your wounds are healing well?

533
01:26:29,379 --> 01:26:32,132
Yes, they are.

534
01:26:35,385 --> 01:26:37,971
You are happy here, with my family?

535
01:26:38,054 --> 01:26:40,390
I am glad to be here.

536
01:26:41,099 --> 01:26:44,603
I am missing my husband.

537
01:26:47,147 --> 01:26:50,400
Perhaps you will marry again
when the time is right?

538
01:26:50,483 --> 01:26:51,818
Perhaps.

539
01:26:57,032 --> 01:27:02,245
We have word from many places
that "The Whites" are coming.

540
01:27:03,663 --> 01:27:06,041
They are coming 
into everyone's country.

541
01:27:06,124 --> 01:27:08,210
I think they will soon be in ours.

542
01:27:08,543 --> 01:27:11,087
This white man who lives 
at the old soldier fort ...

543
01:27:11,171 --> 01:27:14,132
I have visited him and I believe 
his heart is a good one.

544
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:23,433
I am afraid of the 
white man at the fort.

545
01:27:24,226 --> 01:27:27,896
I am afraid he will 
tell others that I am here.

546
01:27:27,979 --> 01:27:30,315
I am afraid they will 
try to take me away.

547
01:27:30,398 --> 01:27:33,443
I've heard they take people away.

548
01:27:33,485 --> 01:27:36,238
Every warrior in camp
would fight them if they tried.

549
01:27:36,321 --> 01:27:39,032
I cannot make the white man language.

550
01:27:39,115 --> 01:27:41,368
He cannot speak Sioux.

551
01:27:42,494 --> 01:27:45,789
It has been a long time 
since I made the talk.

552
01:27:45,830 --> 01:27:47,916
I want you to try.

553
01:27:48,542 --> 01:27:50,168
I don't know how.

554
01:27:50,252 --> 01:27:51,753
Yes, you do.

555
01:27:51,836 --> 01:27:53,463
I can't.

556
01:27:54,714 --> 01:27:56,967
I can't. It's dead in me.

557
01:27:58,009 --> 01:28:02,430
I don't ask this for myself.
I ask this for all the people.

558
01:28:02,514 --> 01:28:05,642
He knows things about "The Whites"
which we do not.

559
01:28:05,684 --> 01:28:08,103
Now, you must remember.

560
01:28:11,523 --> 01:28:13,483
I can't.

561
01:28:24,202 --> 01:28:27,372
Will she make the white words?

562
01:28:28,582 --> 01:28:31,376
She won't try. She is being difficult.

563
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:34,546
Well, she's the one who's crying.

564
01:28:34,629 --> 01:28:38,008
Perhaps the difficulty is yours.

565
01:29:44,407 --> 01:29:45,742
Christine!

566
01:30:01,299 --> 01:30:03,593
Get 'em, Joe! Get them chickens!

567
01:30:06,304 --> 01:30:08,932
Billy, you get away from those puppies!

568
01:30:15,605 --> 01:30:16,690
Damn!

569
01:30:17,315 --> 01:30:19,943
Get the kids, 
and get them in the house.

570
01:30:21,278 --> 01:30:22,445
Go on!

571
01:30:24,865 --> 01:30:26,199
Christine!

572
01:30:27,158 --> 01:30:29,870
Christine! Where are you?

573
01:30:31,705 --> 01:30:33,498
I'm up here, mother.

574
01:30:33,582 --> 01:30:35,500
- Get down now.
- Why?

575
01:30:35,584 --> 01:30:36,960
Just do it.

576
01:30:44,926 --> 01:30:48,638
Stay right where you are. 
Get back. Do you hear me?

577
01:30:49,681 --> 01:30:51,975
Joe, get in the house right now!

578
01:30:58,982 --> 01:31:00,150
Willie!

579
01:31:00,775 --> 01:31:04,196
- Who is it, Willie?
- They look like Pawnee.

580
01:31:04,237 --> 01:31:07,199
My father and your father 
are talking to them.

581
01:31:07,949 --> 01:31:10,493
- What do they want?
- I don't know.

582
01:31:11,328 --> 01:31:13,914
Go on. You heard him. 
Get out of here.

583
01:31:26,468 --> 01:31:28,511
Run, Christine!

584
01:31:28,887 --> 01:31:30,847
I said run!

585
01:31:33,558 --> 01:31:34,976
Joe!

586
01:31:50,992 --> 01:31:52,327
Christine!

587
01:32:04,297 --> 01:32:05,757
Mommy!

588
01:32:44,754 --> 01:32:47,591
Come on, Two Socks. Bacon.

589
01:32:47,632 --> 01:32:50,927
"Two Socks, like Cisco,
has become a trusted friend.

590
01:32:51,094 --> 01:32:53,263
"He still won't eat from my hand ...

591
01:32:53,346 --> 01:32:57,601
"but his keen eyes and ears never fail 
to alert me when something is wrong."

592
01:33:22,959 --> 01:33:24,169
Tatanka.

593
01:33:26,254 --> 01:33:27,255
No.

594
01:33:27,464 --> 01:33:29,674
No, I haven't seen any buffalo.

595
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:31,718
Sorry.

596
01:33:50,654 --> 01:33:52,697
Are you hungry?

597
01:33:54,616 --> 01:33:56,117
Are you hungry?

598
01:33:56,618 --> 01:33:59,871
I have food. I have a lot of food.

599
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:26,314
"Nothing I've been told
about these people is correct.

600
01:34:26,398 --> 01:34:28,149
"They are not beggars and thieves.

601
01:34:28,233 --> 01:34:31,111
"They are not the bogeymen
they've been made out to be.

602
01:34:31,236 --> 01:34:35,490
"On the contrary, they are polite guests
and have a familiar humor I enjoy.

603
01:34:35,574 --> 01:34:37,701
"Real communication 
is slow, however ...

604

"and the quiet one is 
as frustrated as I am.

605

"Most of our progress has been 
built on the basis of failure ...

606

"rather than success.

607
01:34:45,625 --> 01:34:49,546
"I've thought to inquire if the 
woman I found lived or not ...

608

"but it seems far too complicated 
a subject, given our limitations.

609
01:34:53,633 --> 01:34:56,386
"One thing is clear, however.
There are no buffalo.

610
01:34:56,428 --> 01:34:58,889
"And it weighs heavy on their minds.

611

and I'm looking forward to going."

613
01:36:33,859 --> 01:36:35,360
We were waiting for you.

614
01:36:48,206 --> 01:36:50,709
We were waiting for you.

615
01:36:50,792 --> 01:36:54,462
Now tell him we are glad 
that he is here.

616
01:36:59,718 --> 01:37:01,011
Hello.

617
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:03,388
You ...

618
01:37:04,180 --> 01:37:05,348
Here ...

619
01:37:08,059 --> 01:37:09,185
Good.

620
01:37:12,731 --> 01:37:14,816
Thank you. I feel good.

621
01:37:15,567 --> 01:37:16,526
I feel good.

622
01:37:19,613 --> 01:37:23,408
Ask him why he is 
at the soldier fort.

623
01:37:27,204 --> 01:37:31,499
The soldier fort.

624
01:37:32,334 --> 01:37:33,460
Wait.

625
01:37:35,545 --> 01:37:37,255
What is your names?

626
01:37:38,340 --> 01:37:41,259
- Our names?
- What is his name?

627
01:37:46,097 --> 01:37:51,519
He's right. 
Introductions should come first.

628
01:37:54,147 --> 01:37:55,398
He ...

629
01:37:57,108 --> 01:37:58,401
He ...

630
01:37:59,444 --> 01:38:00,570
Kick.

631
01:38:01,112 --> 01:38:02,614
Kick?

632
01:38:03,198 --> 01:38:04,241
More.

633
01:38:04,616 --> 01:38:05,742
More kick?

634
01:38:06,159 --> 01:38:07,619
More kicking?

635
01:38:08,078 --> 01:38:09,287
Kicking.

636
01:38:11,456 --> 01:38:13,959
Bird? Bird, kicking bird.

637
01:38:14,042 --> 01:38:15,710
'Kicking Bird'.

638
01:38:20,966 --> 01:38:22,342
What is he ...

639
01:38:23,969 --> 01:38:25,345
Is he chief?

640
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:26,721
No.

641
01:38:39,109 --> 01:38:41,778
A holy man.

642
01:38:42,237 --> 01:38:44,155
Holy man.

643
01:38:48,952 --> 01:38:49,911
Your name?

644
01:38:51,705 --> 01:38:54,457
- I don't —
- How are you called?

645
01:39:25,864 --> 01:39:27,240
Get up?

646
01:39:32,037 --> 01:39:33,163
Stand up?

647
01:39:34,664 --> 01:39:36,208
Stands?

648
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:39,294
Stands. Your name's "Stands"?

649
01:39:39,669 --> 01:39:41,171
Stands.

650
01:39:44,466 --> 01:39:46,509
- With.
- With?

651
01:39:46,593 --> 01:39:49,554
- With.
- Stands with?

652
01:39:52,766 --> 01:39:53,850
Fist?

653
01:39:54,476 --> 01:39:55,518
Yes.

654
01:39:56,061 --> 01:39:57,812
Stands With A Fist?

655
01:40:01,149 --> 01:40:02,859
'Stands With A Fist'.

656
01:40:03,318 --> 01:40:04,903
I'm John Dunbar.

657

John Dunbar.

658

Dumb Bear.

659

No, not Dumb Bear.

Bar.

Not Dumb Bear.

Dunbar.

"There's been an exciting 
breakthrough with the Indians.

"The woman I found
on the prairie speaks English ...

667

"She is white, and though I cannot be sure
how she came to be with these people ...

"I can tell she is not a captive.

"While I'm not afraid ...

"I don't feel completely
welcome by everyone in the village.

672

"My being here must 
be 'Kicking Bird's' idea.

"He is very enthusiastic 
and like two children ...

674

"we are both anxious
to know more about each other.

to answer all his questions.

"Maybe it's my sense of duty ...

"but something tells me 
not to say too much.

"It was good to see 
Fort Sedgewick again ...

visit with my new neighbors.

for my relief and can only hope ...

"that my negotiations with the wild 
people of the plains will bear fruit."

Buffalo!

685
01:44:01,097 --> 01:44:04,059
Buffalo! I've seen buffalo!

Buffaloes!

Tatanka?

Yeah.

my things at Sedgewick ...

"Their efficiency and speed
with which they moved ...

694

"was enough to impress
any military commander.

"Spirits are high, and overnight
I've gone from a person of suspicion ...

this impossible image ...

it could only be white hunters.

"Voices that had been 
joyous all morning ...

left to rot in this valley ...

I realized that the gap between us ...

people not able to predict a future."

Are you all right?

I can't.

734
02:04:58,230 --> 02:05:00,565
No, I'm full.

735
02:05:00,649 --> 02:05:04,027
I'm full, and I can't 
tell the story anymore.

02:05:05,195 --> 02:05:06,363
No.

737

You want to try it?

738
02:05:16,623 --> 02:05:18,291
You want to try it?

739
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:23,004
Here.

740
02:05:53,034 --> 02:05:55,036
I can't. This is too much.

741
02:06:02,127 --> 02:06:03,503
Good trade.

742
02:06:06,506 --> 02:06:08,758
This is a good trade.

743
02:06:13,805 --> 02:06:16,433
No, no, I can't. 
I'm full, I'm tired.

744
02:06:16,516 --> 02:06:17,559
No!

745
02:06:27,986 --> 02:06:30,155
Loo ten tant! Loo ten tant!

746
02:06:38,205 --> 02:06:40,498
Tatanka. Big tatanka.

747
02:06:40,582 --> 02:06:42,000
Big tatanka.

748
02:07:11,988 --> 02:07:13,073
That's my hat!

749
02:07:23,500 --> 02:07:25,085
You're wearing my hat.

750
02:07:29,005 --> 02:07:30,382
It's my hat.

751
02:07:30,715 --> 02:07:33,009
I found it on the prairie. 
It's mine.

752
02:07:35,512 --> 02:07:37,264
No, you ...

753
02:07:38,723 --> 02:07:39,933
My hat.

754
02:07:58,702 --> 02:08:02,831
That hat belongs to the Lieutenant.

755
02:08:02,914 --> 02:08:07,752
He left it on the prairie. 
He didn't want it.

756
02:08:09,379 --> 02:08:12,591
Well, you can see he wants it now.

757
02:08:13,717 --> 02:08:17,637
We all know that it's a soldier's hat.

758
02:08:18,972 --> 02:08:21,641
We all know who wears it.

759
02:08:22,601 --> 02:08:24,811
If you want to keep it, 
that's all right.

760
02:08:24,895 --> 02:08:27,105
But give something for it.

761
02:09:03,600 --> 02:09:04,976
Good trade.

762
02:11:17,692 --> 02:11:19,236
There you are.

763
02:11:19,319 --> 02:11:20,946
Come here, Cisco.

764
02:12:17,961 --> 02:12:20,797
"It seems every day ends 
with a miracle here.

"And whatever God may be,
I thank God for this day.

"To stay any longer 
would have been useless.

767

"We had all the meat 
we could possibly carry.

768

"We had hunted for three days,
losing a half a dozen ponies ...

"and only three men injured.

770

"so devoted to family,
so dedicated to each other.

772
02:12:42,986 --> 02:12:46,031
"And the only word
that came to mind was "harmony."

773

"Many times I've felt alone ...

for the fact that I am bored ...

"for my regular duties here.

782

serious signs of neglect.

the company of my friends.

them a visit.

obligations to the military."

Go home!

You were right. 
He is a special white man.

02:21:59,668 --> 02:22:04,381
"I tell him they will most likely
pass through this country and nothing more.

806
02:22:04,548 --> 02:22:06,675
"But I am speaking in half-truths.

807
02:22:06,841 --> 02:22:11,388
"One day there will be too many, but I 
cannot bring myself to tell him that.

808
02:22:11,513 --> 02:22:14,766
"I am sure that 'Stands With A Fist'
knows that I am holding back ...

809
02:22:15,058 --> 02:22:17,561
"but to her credit, she says nothing."

810
02:22:46,423 --> 02:22:50,594
"A war party is going against the 
Pawnee soon and I have asked to go.

811
02:22:50,719 --> 02:22:52,888
"I sense I made a mistake in doing so ...

812
02:22:52,971 --> 02:22:55,849
"but I could not bring myself 
to take it back.

813
02:22:55,891 --> 02:22:58,602
"They are my friends,
and from what little I gather ...

814
02:22:58,685 --> 02:23:01,187
"the Pawnee have been
very hard on these people.

815
02:23:01,271 --> 02:23:03,982
"I hope I have not 
overstepped my bounds."

816
02:23:08,403 --> 02:23:09,988
Come in, please.

817
02:23:12,449 --> 02:23:13,700
Sit down?

818
02:23:17,204 --> 02:23:19,289
'Kicking Bird' want to know ...

819
02:23:19,372 --> 02:23:22,959
why you want to make war 
on the Pawnee.

820
02:23:23,585 --> 02:23:26,296
They have done nothing to you.

821
02:23:26,963 --> 02:23:28,840
They are Sioux enemies.

822
02:23:36,389 --> 02:23:39,142
Only Sioux warriors to go.

823
02:23:40,101 --> 02:23:41,978
Tell him that 
I have been a warrior ...

824
02:23:42,062 --> 02:23:45,398
longer than many of the young men
who will go on this war party.

825
02:23:45,857 --> 02:23:47,108
Tell him.

826
02:24:01,706 --> 02:24:04,960
He said that the Sioux way 
of being a warrior ...

827
02:24:05,043 --> 02:24:06,962
is not the white way.

828
02:24:07,546 --> 02:24:11,591
- You are not ready.
- I know, I understand.

829
02:24:11,633 --> 02:24:14,219
Tell him I cannot learn 
these ways in camp.

830
02:24:21,643 --> 02:24:23,812
He also asks that you ...

831
02:24:24,813 --> 02:24:28,275
watch over his family 
while he is gone.

832
02:24:29,276 --> 02:24:33,029
This thing he asks 
is a great honor for you.

833
02:24:36,575 --> 02:24:40,495
Tell him that I would be happy
to watch over his family.

834
02:24:46,918 --> 02:24:49,671
He thanks 'Dances With Wolves'
for coming.

835
02:24:51,172 --> 02:24:53,174
Who is Dances With Wolves?

836
02:24:55,135 --> 02:24:58,638
It is the name 
which all the people ...

837
02:24:58,722 --> 02:25:00,515
are calling you now.

838
02:25:01,057 --> 02:25:02,559
Dances With ...

839
02:25:04,019 --> 02:25:05,520
That's right.

840
02:25:05,937 --> 02:25:07,230
That day.

841
02:25:08,481 --> 02:25:10,150
'Dances With Wolves'.

842
02:25:11,818 --> 02:25:13,486
How do you say it?

843
02:26:13,255 --> 02:26:18,718
Keep on with the white man 
talk if it pleases you.

844
02:26:18,802 --> 02:26:21,263
I like to make the talk.

845
02:27:01,887 --> 02:27:03,138
I'm here.

846
02:27:06,308 --> 02:27:07,726
We walk.

847
02:27:40,842 --> 02:27:42,385
I cut this off.

848
02:27:43,386 --> 02:27:45,680
I shaved it off. More.

849
02:27:47,849 --> 02:27:49,976
Grass grows on the prairie.

850
02:27:50,018 --> 02:27:51,519
"Grass grows on the prairie"?

851
02:27:53,772 --> 02:27:55,232
- Wrong.
- Wrong?

852
02:27:55,315 --> 02:27:57,484
You said, "Fire lives on the prairie."

853
02:27:57,526 --> 02:27:58,777
I did?

854
02:27:59,444 --> 02:28:02,405
No laughing, though.

855
02:28:06,409 --> 02:28:09,246
That man is a fighter.

856
02:28:13,500 --> 02:28:14,709
Again.

857
02:28:15,502 --> 02:28:18,880
- That man is a fighter.
- Okay, I have it.

858
02:28:22,551 --> 02:28:23,677
Yes.

859
02:28:31,101 --> 02:28:32,852
Hoo hoo, right?

860
02:28:38,400 --> 02:28:39,359
No?

861
02:28:48,493 --> 02:28:49,828
Try this.

862
02:28:52,080 --> 02:28:53,748
What's the word ...

863
02:28:54,291 --> 02:28:55,834
for beautiful?

864
02:29:01,089 --> 02:29:03,341
What are you doing?

865
02:29:03,425 --> 02:29:07,178
It's hot, and we are 
sitting in the shade.

866
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:13,602
I'm hungry.

867
02:29:31,369 --> 02:29:34,080
How is 'Dances With Wolves'?

868
02:29:36,166 --> 02:29:38,335
What do you mean?

869
02:29:39,544 --> 02:29:42,088
How is he learning?

870
02:29:42,881 --> 02:29:46,593
He is a fast learner.

871
02:29:46,676 --> 02:29:49,554
What did you think I meant?

872
02:30:09,699 --> 02:30:11,826
You go for water, today?

873
02:30:16,623 --> 02:30:19,709
Then let us take you.

874
02:30:35,016 --> 02:30:37,060
How did you get your name?

875
02:30:41,356 --> 02:30:44,276
I was not very old ...

876
02:30:45,235 --> 02:30:47,696
when I came to be with the people.

877
02:30:48,530 --> 02:30:50,448
And I was made to work.

878
02:30:51,575 --> 02:30:53,702
I worked every day, very hard.

879
02:30:55,453 --> 02:30:58,832
There was a woman ...

880
02:30:58,874 --> 02:31:00,876
who didn't like me much.

881
02:31:02,460 --> 02:31:06,548
She used to call me bad names,
and sometimes she ...

882
02:31:11,136 --> 02:31:12,387
Beat me?

883
02:31:16,391 --> 02:31:18,143
And one day, she was ...

884
02:31:18,977 --> 02:31:21,187
calling me these bad names ...

885
02:31:21,563 --> 02:31:24,107
with her face in my face ...

886
02:31:25,066 --> 02:31:26,401
and I hit her.

887
02:31:28,361 --> 02:31:31,489
I was not very big, but she fell down.

888
02:31:31,740 --> 02:31:33,950
She fell hard and didn't move.

889
02:31:35,368 --> 02:31:38,747
And then I stood over 
her with my fist ...

890
02:31:38,955 --> 02:31:40,290
and I asked if ...

891
02:31:40,707 --> 02:31:43,001
there was any other woman ...

892
02:31:43,585 --> 02:31:45,879
who wanted to call me bad names.

893
02:31:47,797 --> 02:31:50,217
No one bothered me after that day.

894
02:31:53,261 --> 02:31:56,264
No, I wouldn't think so.

895
02:32:01,353 --> 02:32:02,729
Show me.

896
02:32:03,772 --> 02:32:05,774
Show me where you hit her.

897
02:32:34,511 --> 02:32:36,471
Why are you not married?

898
02:32:40,517 --> 02:32:42,018
- I'm sorry.
- I have to go.

899
02:32:44,938 --> 02:32:46,273
I'm sorry.

900
02:32:48,441 --> 02:32:49,609
Can I help you?

901
02:33:19,931 --> 02:33:22,767
You are not talking today?

902
02:33:22,851 --> 02:33:24,561
No, I am not.

903
02:34:30,919 --> 02:34:37,050
Some of your words are wrong
but you are learning fast.

904
02:34:38,093 --> 02:34:42,430
So what can I tell you today?

905
02:34:43,640 --> 02:34:45,976
I want to know about 
'Stands With A Fist'.

906
02:34:46,059 --> 02:34:49,145
Why is there no man with her?

907
02:34:50,522 --> 02:34:53,233
She is in mourning.

908
02:34:55,777 --> 02:34:56,945
I don't ...

909
02:34:58,280 --> 02:35:01,825
I do not understand "mourning."

910
02:35:03,368 --> 02:35:05,787
She cries for someone.

911
02:35:07,998 --> 02:35:10,417
Cries for who?

912
02:35:14,170 --> 02:35:17,048
It is not polite 
to speak of the dead.

913
02:35:17,132 --> 02:35:21,094
But you are new, so I will tell you.

914
02:35:21,177 --> 02:35:23,471
She cries for her husband.

915
02:35:23,513 --> 02:35:25,640
He was killed not long ago.

916
02:35:25,724 --> 02:35:30,353
That is how you came 
to find her on the prairie.

917
02:35:33,732 --> 02:35:37,652
How long will she cry?

918
02:35:39,571 --> 02:35:44,492
It is 'Kicking Bird's' place
to say when she is finished.

919
02:35:44,826 --> 02:35:48,455
He's the one that found her
when she was very little.

920
02:36:06,181 --> 02:36:09,142
People are talking about you.

921
02:36:11,811 --> 02:36:13,855
What are they saying?

922
02:36:16,566 --> 02:36:18,777
They are proud of the medicine ...

923
02:36:18,860 --> 02:36:22,322
you are making with 
'Dances With Wolves'.

924
02:36:25,158 --> 02:36:29,454
I have hurt him, 
and I should go talk to him.

925
02:36:30,539 --> 02:36:33,250
You can't. He is gone.

926
02:36:34,084 --> 02:36:36,336
He left this morning.

927
02:39:01,523 --> 02:39:03,441
Bet you were thinking:

928
02:39:03,525 --> 02:39:05,527
"Now, why don't he write?"

929
02:39:06,361 --> 02:39:08,029
Hello, Two Socks.

930
02:39:35,515 --> 02:39:36,766
Come on.

931
02:39:41,396 --> 02:39:44,983
I won't hurt you. 
Come on. You can do this.

932
02:39:45,358 --> 02:39:46,985
You can do this.

933
02:39:51,364 --> 02:39:52,532
Come on.

934
02:40:04,669 --> 02:40:06,129
This is easy.

935
02:40:06,671 --> 02:40:08,590
This is easy, Two Socks.

936
02:41:30,005 --> 02:41:31,673
I am in mourning.

937
02:41:41,016 --> 02:41:42,517
No, we cannot.

938
02:41:42,809 --> 02:41:45,729
- Yes.
- We must be careful.

939
02:41:47,772 --> 02:41:49,191
We must be careful.

940
02:41:49,274 --> 02:41:50,734
Okay.

941
02:42:54,548 --> 02:42:55,632
Wait!

942
02:45:01,883 --> 02:45:02,968
What?

943
02:45:03,802 --> 02:45:05,011
Trouble.

944
02:45:28,660 --> 02:45:32,080
The Pawnee are coming.
A big party of 40 or 50 men this time.

945
02:45:32,163 --> 02:45:34,666
Hunters found them not far 
to the north. Soon be here.

946
02:45:34,791 --> 02:45:38,837
'Stone Calf', wait. I will follow you.

947
02:45:38,920 --> 02:45:41,798
The Pawnee do not come for horses.
They come for blood.

948
02:45:41,882 --> 02:45:43,842
Get your weapons and come to my lodge.

949
02:45:45,760 --> 02:45:46,970
I will get them.

950
02:45:47,721 --> 02:45:49,639
'Stone Calf', wait.

951
02:45:49,723 --> 02:45:50,807
I have guns.

952
02:45:50,891 --> 02:45:53,351
I have many rifles.

953
02:45:55,520 --> 02:45:57,647
- At the fort?
- Yes.

954
02:45:58,356 --> 02:46:00,901
No. The ride is long and 
we can spare no men.

955
02:46:00,984 --> 02:46:04,112
Guns would make one warrior like two.

956
02:46:09,534 --> 02:46:12,746
Take one man and go quickly.

957
02:46:13,830 --> 02:46:16,374
I will take 'Smiles A Lot'.

958
02:47:06,299 --> 02:47:07,300
Okay!

959
02:49:42,122 --> 02:49:43,623
Shoot the gun!

960
02:54:11,433 --> 02:54:13,560
"It was hard to know how to feel.

961
02:54:13,643 --> 02:54:16,229
"I'd never been in a battle 
like this one.

962
02:54:16,313 --> 02:54:18,982
"There was no dark 
political objective.

963
02:54:19,065 --> 02:54:23,069
"This was not a fight for territory 
or riches or to make men free.

964
02:54:23,153 --> 02:54:27,073
"It was fought to preserve the food stores
that would see us through the winter.

965
02:54:27,115 --> 02:54:31,578
"To protect the lives of women and children
and loved ones only a few feet away.

966
02:54:31,828 --> 02:54:35,498
"'Stone Calf' was a great loss, but even 
the old men could not remember ...

967
02:54:35,582 --> 02:54:37,542
"such a one-sided victory.

968
02:54:37,626 --> 02:54:40,587
"And I gradually began
to look at it in a new way.

969
02:54:40,795 --> 02:54:43,340
"I felt a pride 
I'd never felt before.

970
02:54:44,132 --> 02:54:46,968
"I'd never really known 
who John Dunbar was.

971
02:54:47,302 --> 02:54:49,846
"Perhaps the name itself 
had no meaning.

972
02:54:49,930 --> 02:54:53,099
"But as I heard my Sioux name
being called over and over ...

973
02:54:53,141 --> 02:54:56,019
"I knew for the first time 
who I really was."

974
02:56:18,977 --> 02:56:22,981
When we were younger, he always 
bragged about how brave he was.

975
02:56:23,064 --> 02:56:26,526
And what a great chief he would make.

976
02:56:26,610 --> 02:56:28,904
He thought I was impressed.

977
02:56:28,987 --> 02:56:33,575
While walking on the prairie,
we surprised a small herd of buffalo.

978
02:56:33,658 --> 02:56:37,245
And the first thing this brave 
warrior did is run for a tree.

979
02:56:39,915 --> 02:56:41,917
He would have forgotten 
all about me ...

980
02:56:41,958 --> 02:56:44,085
if he hadn't needed 
my help to climb it.

981
02:56:44,169 --> 02:56:48,798
And we sat there all day
as this old cow circled below.

982
02:56:48,882 --> 02:56:51,760
Making loud noises and hitting 
her head against the trunk.

983
02:57:02,854 --> 02:57:06,733
Where are you going?
There is gambling tonight.

984
02:57:06,775 --> 02:57:09,277
'Horseback's' games are always good.

985
02:57:10,612 --> 02:57:15,116
I'm tired. 'Horseback' already 
has a good rifle of mine.

986
02:57:18,620 --> 02:57:20,497
Good night.

987
02:58:03,665 --> 02:58:06,751
How long will 
'Stands With A Fist' mourn?

988
02:58:07,544 --> 02:58:09,504
I don't know.

989
02:58:13,174 --> 02:58:16,303
I hope it will not be too long.

990
02:58:18,889 --> 02:58:20,974
Has something happened?

991
02:58:21,600 --> 02:58:23,226
What?

992
02:58:24,060 --> 02:58:26,855
She has found love again.

993
02:58:27,898 --> 02:58:29,900
With who?

994
02:58:29,983 --> 02:58:31,484
Who do you think?

995
02:58:31,526 --> 02:58:32,819
Tell me.

996
02:58:32,903 --> 02:58:35,238
'Dances With Wolves'.

997
02:58:38,200 --> 02:58:40,160
Are you certain of this?

998
02:58:40,994 --> 02:58:44,748
When you see them together, 
you will know.

999
02:58:46,458 --> 02:58:48,501
What are people saying?

1000
02:58:49,211 --> 02:58:51,296
They like the match.

1001
02:58:56,384 --> 02:58:58,511
No one is angry?

1002
02:58:58,595 --> 02:59:02,641
It makes sense. 
They are both white.

1003
02:59:04,643 --> 02:59:08,855
I suppose I will be the one 
to say something.

1004
02:59:09,731 --> 02:59:12,359
She's your daughter now.

1005
02:59:12,859 --> 02:59:14,819
I know.

1006
02:59:20,283 --> 02:59:24,204
Relax. You can't see everything coming.

1007
02:59:24,913 --> 02:59:28,250
Stop it. Quit your playing.

1008
02:59:41,972 --> 02:59:43,640
'Stands With A Fist'.

1009
02:59:44,933 --> 02:59:47,477
You will mourn no more.

1010
03:00:07,789 --> 03:00:10,375
Sit, sit.

1011
03:00:16,464 --> 03:00:19,509
There's talk that you want 
to get married.

1012
03:00:21,803 --> 03:00:23,179
To who?

1013
03:00:23,930 --> 03:00:26,016
To 'Stands With A Fist'.

1014
03:00:26,099 --> 03:00:28,018
That's the one, isn't it?

1015
03:00:28,101 --> 03:00:29,311
She's in mourning.

1016
03:00:29,394 --> 03:00:30,854
Not today.

1017
03:00:30,937 --> 03:00:33,732
'Kicking Bird' has released her.

1018
03:00:33,815 --> 03:00:35,775
He did?

1019
03:00:36,151 --> 03:00:38,320
What are you doing here?

1020
03:00:39,613 --> 03:00:42,782
'Kicking Bird' told me to wait.

1021
03:00:44,534 --> 03:00:46,786
You might have to wait a long time.

1022
03:00:46,828 --> 03:00:50,957
'Smiles A Lot' says he saw 'Kicking Bird'
riding on the prairie.

1023
03:00:52,417 --> 03:00:55,503
He says he was talking to himself.

1024
03:00:55,587 --> 03:00:57,130
A medicine man takes it pretty hard ...

1025
03:00:57,172 --> 03:00:59,174
when he is the last to know something.

1026
03:01:01,343 --> 03:01:03,595
What do I do?

1027
03:01:06,765 --> 03:01:10,977
You are pretty poor
and a Sioux girl is not for free.

1028
03:01:11,019 --> 03:01:13,563
I don't know if you can get married.

1029
03:01:18,318 --> 03:01:20,320
I have the buckskin ...

1030
03:01:20,362 --> 03:01:21,905
No, that's too much medicine.

1031
03:01:24,366 --> 03:01:28,787
Do you think my horse is 
too much medicine?

1032
03:01:30,705 --> 03:01:33,208
For a girl.

1033
03:01:37,629 --> 03:01:41,508
Wait here. Maybe we can help you.

1034
03:01:41,591 --> 03:01:43,260
Wait.

1035
03:01:45,470 --> 03:01:47,430
That's all I do is wait!

1036
03:02:08,243 --> 03:02:11,955
"The whole village was eager
to take up a collection on my behalf.

1037
03:02:12,080 --> 03:02:15,041
"The generosity 
of the people was astonishing.

1038
03:02:15,083 --> 03:02:18,461
"The more valued the gift,
the more easily it was given.

1039
03:02:18,587 --> 03:02:22,924
"Even the poorer families wanted to 
give up animals they could not afford.

1040
03:02:23,049 --> 03:02:25,260
"It was hard to turn them away.

1041
03:02:29,973 --> 03:02:32,017
"'Black Shawl' was a mystery.

1042
03:02:32,767 --> 03:02:36,271
"I couldn't guess what she was thinking
and she offered no advice ...

1043
03:02:36,771 --> 03:02:38,815
"no words of encouragement.

1044
03:02:44,613 --> 03:02:46,948
"I may have been the brunt 
of an inside joke ...

1045
03:02:47,032 --> 03:02:49,367
"that included the entire village ...

1046
03:02:49,492 --> 03:02:51,328
"but I was determined.

1047
03:02:54,664 --> 03:02:58,084
"'Wind In His Hair' told me if all the 
gifts were gone in the morning ...

1048
03:02:58,126 --> 03:03:00,253
"my offer had been accepted.

1049
03:03:01,296 --> 03:03:05,550
"I spent a sleepless night wondering 
what mis-step, if any, I had made.

1050
03:03:06,468 --> 03:03:09,804
"I had no idea what 'Kicking Bird's' 
decision would be."

1051
03:03:33,203 --> 03:03:34,746
Turn around.

1052
03:03:36,831 --> 03:03:39,209
You look good.

1053
03:03:39,292 --> 03:03:42,337
You know, the man she mourned for ...

1054
03:03:42,420 --> 03:03:45,215
He was my best friend.

1055
03:03:47,008 --> 03:03:49,135
I didn't know that.

1056
03:03:51,638 --> 03:03:53,723
He was a good man.

1057
03:03:54,349 --> 03:03:57,519
It has been hard 
for me to like you.

1058
03:03:58,979 --> 03:04:02,399
I am not the thinker 
'Kicking Bird' is.

1059
03:04:02,482 --> 03:04:04,901
I always feel anger first.

1060
03:04:04,985 --> 03:04:07,654
There were no answers 
to my questions.

1061
03:04:07,696 --> 03:04:12,909
But now I think he went away
because you were coming.

1062
03:04:12,993 --> 03:04:15,287
That is how I see it.

1063
03:04:39,394 --> 03:04:42,022
This is a good day for me.

1064
03:04:43,940 --> 03:04:45,317
And for me.

1065
03:04:48,820 --> 03:04:52,532
If you want this man, 
take his hand in yours.

1066
03:05:07,339 --> 03:05:09,424
"I had never been married before.

1067
03:05:09,507 --> 03:05:12,427
"I don't know if all grooms
have the same experience ...

1068
03:05:12,510 --> 03:05:16,890
"but as 'Kicking Bird' began to speak about
what was expected of a Sioux husband ...

1069
03:05:16,932 --> 03:05:20,727
"my mind began to swim in a way that
shut out everything but her ...

1070
03:05:20,769 --> 03:05:23,063
"the tiny details of her costume ...

1071
03:05:23,146 --> 03:05:25,232
"the contours of her shape ...

1072
03:05:25,482 --> 03:05:27,400
"the light in her eyes ...

1073
03:05:27,567 --> 03:05:29,611
"the smallness of her feet.

1074
03:05:30,320 --> 03:05:33,156
"I knew that the love
between us would be served."

1075
03:05:38,995 --> 03:05:42,290
Have you heard all that I have said?

1076
03:05:44,626 --> 03:05:45,627
Yes.

1077
03:05:47,462 --> 03:05:51,174
Good, then take her inside.

1078
03:05:51,258 --> 03:05:52,968
She is your wife.

1079
03:05:55,387 --> 03:05:56,680
Good.

1080
03:05:58,181 --> 03:06:00,642
Thank you.

1081
03:06:07,274 --> 03:06:08,316
Bye.

1082
03:06:13,738 --> 03:06:14,781
Bye.

1083
03:06:58,909 --> 03:07:02,495
'Dances With Wolves' door
is closed a lot these days.

1084
03:07:02,579 --> 03:07:06,541
I think they're having 
trouble making a baby.

1085
03:07:06,583 --> 03:07:09,920
I don't think they're 
having trouble at all.

1086
03:07:13,882 --> 03:07:17,344
If we pull the smoke flap shut,
they will come out for sure.

1087
03:07:42,410 --> 03:07:46,248
'Dances With Wolves', 
are you in there?

1088
03:07:48,917 --> 03:07:53,046
Today I am riding away 
to a far away place.

1089
03:07:53,129 --> 03:07:55,298
I would like you to ride with me.

1090
03:08:11,022 --> 03:08:13,233
It's good to be out.

1091
03:08:14,234 --> 03:08:16,611
Yes, it must be.

1092
03:08:17,779 --> 03:08:20,156
We are trying for a baby.

1093
03:08:21,533 --> 03:08:23,243
No waiting?

1094
03:08:23,827 --> 03:08:25,579
No waiting.

1095
03:08:29,833 --> 03:08:34,296
I was just thinking that of all 
the trails in this life ...

1096
03:08:35,463 --> 03:08:38,258
there is one that matters most.

1097
03:08:38,341 --> 03:08:41,636
It is the trail of a true human being.

1098
03:08:42,929 --> 03:08:47,392
I think you are on this trail, 
and it is good to see.

1099
03:09:07,329 --> 03:09:09,831
We call you the Busy Bee.

1100
03:09:45,867 --> 03:09:49,704
It is said that all the 
animals were born here.

1101
03:09:49,788 --> 03:09:54,000
That from here they spread over 
the prairies to feed all the people.

1102
03:09:54,626 --> 03:09:58,171
Even our enemies agree
that this is a sacred place.

1103
03:10:49,306 --> 03:10:51,057
It's quiet here.

1104
03:12:51,094 --> 03:12:53,680
We must wait for these people.

1105
03:12:55,015 --> 03:12:58,768
No, they've been gone a week. 
Maybe more.

1106
03:13:01,396 --> 03:13:04,691
We will water the horses and go home.

1107
03:13:51,029 --> 03:13:54,824
You always ask about the white people.

1108
03:13:56,618 --> 03:13:58,787
You always want to know
how many more are coming.

1109
03:14:01,122 --> 03:14:03,792
There will be a lot, my friend.

1110
03:14:03,875 --> 03:14:05,627
More than can be counted.

1111
03:14:08,171 --> 03:14:09,422
How many?

1112
03:14:12,133 --> 03:14:13,635
Like the stars.

1113
03:14:27,983 --> 03:14:31,945
It makes me afraid for all the Sioux.

1114
03:14:39,327 --> 03:14:42,122
We should tell this to 'Ten Bears'.

1115
03:15:08,607 --> 03:15:10,650
The men who wore this came ...

1116
03:15:10,734 --> 03:15:13,612
in the time of my 
grandfather's grandfather.

1117
03:15:14,196 --> 03:15:16,907
Eventually we drove them out.

1118
03:15:17,657 --> 03:15:21,369
Then the Mexicans came.
They do not come here anymore.

1119
03:15:21,786 --> 03:15:24,831
In my own time, the Texans.

1120
03:15:24,873 --> 03:15:27,417
They have been like all the others.

1121
03:15:30,462 --> 03:15:35,175
They take without asking.

1122
03:15:36,134 --> 03:15:39,930
I don't know if we are 
ready for these people.

1123
03:15:41,389 --> 03:15:45,936
But I think you are right.
I think they will keep coming.

1124
03:15:47,187 --> 03:15:49,648
When I think of that, 
I look at this helmet.

1125
03:15:52,192 --> 03:15:56,321
Our country is all that we have,
and we will fight to keep it.

1126
03:15:57,405 --> 03:15:59,449
Tomorrow we will 
strike the village ...

1127
03:15:59,533 --> 03:16:01,868
and go to the winter camp.

1128
03:16:33,066 --> 03:16:35,861
You have everything 
from the soldier fort?

1129
03:16:36,111 --> 03:16:37,153
Yes.

1130
03:16:37,487 --> 03:16:39,614
There's nothing for me there.

1131
03:16:40,574 --> 03:16:41,992
That's good.

1132
03:16:55,589 --> 03:16:56,965
The journal.

1133
03:16:59,217 --> 03:17:00,927
Stands With ... Wait!

1134
03:17:01,303 --> 03:17:02,470
Words are important!

1135
03:17:02,554 --> 03:17:04,931
The words in the book are like a 
trail for people to follow.

1136
03:17:04,973 --> 03:17:08,768
Now, it tells everything about 
my life here. I must get it.

1137
03:17:08,977 --> 03:17:10,145
Enough.

1138
03:17:10,228 --> 03:17:12,814
We cannot wait for you.

1139
03:17:24,701 --> 03:17:26,912
I'll catch up.

1140
03:18:08,537 --> 03:18:09,663
Injun!

1141
03:18:10,080 --> 03:18:11,581
Get him! Injun!

1142
03:18:17,212 --> 03:18:18,213
No!

1143
03:18:39,818 --> 03:18:42,028
Stay down. Stay.

1144
03:18:42,404 --> 03:18:43,822
My God.

1145
03:18:44,489 --> 03:18:45,740
God.

1146
03:18:51,413 --> 03:18:52,664
It's okay.

1147
03:19:34,956 --> 03:19:36,499
Something has happened.

1148
03:19:36,583 --> 03:19:39,169
'Dances With Wolves' is not coming.

1149
03:19:39,794 --> 03:19:41,796
He must have trouble.

1150
03:19:43,465 --> 03:19:48,803
Pick two good men and send them 
back to the soldier fort.

1151
03:20:00,607 --> 03:20:01,983
Spivey.

1152
03:20:02,859 --> 03:20:05,070
- Spivey!
- Yeah, Sergeant.

1153
03:20:06,154 --> 03:20:08,365
Tell the major he's waking up.

1154
03:20:10,283 --> 03:20:12,202
Move your worthless ass.

1155
03:20:23,755 --> 03:20:25,799
You got yourself 
a hell of a shiner ...

1156
03:20:26,591 --> 03:20:27,884
didn't you?

1157
03:20:27,968 --> 03:20:30,053
Major's coming through.

1158
03:20:40,146 --> 03:20:42,023
Does he speak English?

1159
03:20:42,190 --> 03:20:43,817
I don't know, sir.

1160
03:20:45,610 --> 03:20:47,404
Speak English?

1161
03:20:49,197 --> 03:20:51,783
Talk English? Talk!

1162
03:20:53,535 --> 03:20:55,161
I speak English.

1163
03:20:59,708 --> 03:21:01,084
Who are you?

1164
03:21:03,253 --> 03:21:07,465
Lt. John J. Dunbar. This is my post.

1165
03:21:08,049 --> 03:21:09,759
Why are you dressed like this?

1166
03:21:12,012 --> 03:21:15,849
I came out from Fort Hayes last April,
but there was nobody here.

1167
03:21:16,433 --> 03:21:18,435
Do you have proof of that?

1168
03:21:20,979 --> 03:21:25,275
My journal's on the bunk in my quarters.
My orders are in the journal.

1169
03:21:25,358 --> 03:21:27,485
It will tell you everything.

1170
03:21:27,777 --> 03:21:30,405
Spivey, you and Edwards
were the first ones here.

1171
03:21:30,488 --> 03:21:32,824
Did you find anything? A journal?

1172
03:21:33,158 --> 03:21:35,493
No, we didn't find nothing, sir.

1173
03:21:35,911 --> 03:21:37,495
Where's Edwards?

1174
03:21:37,996 --> 03:21:39,456
He's outside.

1175
03:21:44,085 --> 03:21:46,504
He didn't find nothing either.

1176
03:21:50,717 --> 03:21:53,053
Somebody find me Edwards.

1177
03:22:01,811 --> 03:22:03,521
You turned Injun, didn't you?

1178
03:22:08,610 --> 03:22:09,986
Didn't you?

1179
03:22:14,658 --> 03:22:16,910
What did you say your name was?

1180
03:22:17,619 --> 03:22:18,787
Dunbar.

1181
03:22:19,871 --> 03:22:22,290
D-u-n-b-a-r. John.

1182
03:22:22,374 --> 03:22:24,376
You say you're an officer?

1183
03:22:24,626 --> 03:22:28,463
- God. Did you read my orders?
- No.

1184
03:22:29,130 --> 03:22:31,216
They're in my journal.

1185
03:22:31,466 --> 03:22:33,176
There are no orders.

1186
03:22:33,635 --> 03:22:35,387
There's no journal.

1187
03:22:39,808 --> 03:22:41,851
Why are you out of uniform?

1188
03:22:44,229 --> 03:22:45,981
I have to relieve myself.

1189
03:22:49,192 --> 03:22:51,945
- Sergeant, take care of him.
- Yes, sir.

1190
03:22:53,572 --> 03:22:54,781
Let's go.

1191
03:22:58,785 --> 03:23:00,954
- He's a white man.
- Doesn't look white to me.

1192
03:23:01,746 --> 03:23:04,749
- They say he's a soldier.
- He's an officer.

1193
03:23:04,833 --> 03:23:06,668
Do you salute him or shoot him?

1194
03:23:15,677 --> 03:23:17,554
Here, you. Eyes front.

1195
03:23:23,435 --> 03:23:25,061
I said eyes front!

1196
03:23:27,105 --> 03:23:29,566
Don't shoot him! Hit him! Get him!

1197
03:23:29,649 --> 03:23:30,942
Get him!

1198
03:24:21,409 --> 03:24:23,411
Why are you out of uniform?

1199
03:24:27,415 --> 03:24:28,917
What's the army doing out here?

1200
03:24:29,960 --> 03:24:32,546
- Lieutenant's asking the questions.
- Bauer.

1201
03:24:38,802 --> 03:24:41,137
We're charged with apprehending ...

1202
03:24:44,057 --> 03:24:47,519
We're charged with apprehending hostiles
and recovering stolen property ...

1203
03:24:47,602 --> 03:24:50,397
retrieving white captives
taken in hostile raidings.

1204
03:24:50,480 --> 03:24:54,442
- There are no hostiles.
- We will ascertain that for ourselves.

1205
03:24:54,526 --> 03:24:57,571
If you'll guide us to these camps
and serve as an interpreter ...

1206
03:24:57,612 --> 03:25:00,031
your conduct will be re-evaluated.

1207
03:25:00,532 --> 03:25:02,576
- What conduct?
- With all due respect —

1208
03:25:02,617 --> 03:25:05,912
Your status as a traitor might 
improve should you choose ...

1209
03:25:05,996 --> 03:25:08,748
to cooperate with the 
United States Army.

1210
03:25:10,542 --> 03:25:12,878
There's nothing for you to do out here.

1211
03:25:16,506 --> 03:25:19,009
Are you willing to cooperate or not?

1212
03:25:21,761 --> 03:25:23,263
Speak up!

1213
03:25:27,058 --> 03:25:30,437
I am 'Dances With Wolves'.

1214
03:25:32,606 --> 03:25:33,481
What's that?

1215
03:25:36,318 --> 03:25:38,987
I have nothing to say to you.

1216
03:25:39,070 --> 03:25:42,282
You are not worth talking to.

1217
03:25:52,292 --> 03:25:55,962
Sergeant, form a detail and 
take this man down to the river.

1218
03:25:56,838 --> 03:25:59,674
- Let him clean up his face.
- Yes, sir.

1219
03:26:01,760 --> 03:26:03,261
Not you, Spivey.

1220
03:26:31,331 --> 03:26:32,666
Lieutenant.

1221
03:26:35,252 --> 03:26:37,212
Major wants to see you.

1222
03:27:11,496 --> 03:27:12,914
Spivey.

1223
03:27:17,919 --> 03:27:19,963
Spivey. You got paper?

1224
03:27:20,589 --> 03:27:24,050
- What's it to you?
- Give me some, shit-bird.

1225
03:27:24,426 --> 03:27:25,468
Can you read?

1226
03:27:25,635 --> 03:27:27,846
No, I can't read. 
What the hell's the difference?

1227
03:27:27,929 --> 03:27:30,891
You can't read either. 
Now just give me some.

1228
03:27:31,391 --> 03:27:35,228
- Quick, give me some!
- All right. Hold your horses.

1229
03:28:57,352 --> 03:28:58,520
Bauer!

1230
03:29:02,148 --> 03:29:03,441
Let go of me!

1231
03:29:11,700 --> 03:29:14,578
Lap it up, Injun. 
Go ahead. Lap it up.

1232
03:29:17,330 --> 03:29:19,082
You son of a bitch!

1233
03:29:22,002 --> 03:29:23,503
It's all right.

1234
03:29:24,212 --> 03:29:25,755
It's all right.

1235
03:29:26,339 --> 03:29:30,510
He's going to get hungrier, that's all.
But maybe that don't matter.

1236
03:29:31,303 --> 03:29:34,306
Word is they're going 
to ship you back to Hayes.

1237
03:29:34,389 --> 03:29:37,058
And once you get there, 
they gonna hang you.

1238
03:29:40,729 --> 03:29:43,732
Come on. Forget about him.
Go on. Get out of here.

1239
03:29:58,830 --> 03:29:59,998
Get up in there!

1240
03:30:25,982 --> 03:30:27,984
Spivey, what is that?

1241
03:30:28,401 --> 03:30:30,570
Looks like he's following us.

1242
03:30:30,820 --> 03:30:32,572
Hell, I'm going to shoot him.

1243
03:30:33,698 --> 03:30:34,866
Dang. You missed him.

1244
03:30:35,909 --> 03:30:38,828
- Don't shoot, damn it. It's my shot.
- Wait. I seen him first.

1245
03:30:38,912 --> 03:30:40,747
- Get down!
- Look at that stupid bastard.

1246
03:30:40,830 --> 03:30:42,582
He ain't even moving.

1247
03:30:43,124 --> 03:30:46,753
- Wait a minute! That's my shot.
- Shoot him!

1248
03:30:47,837 --> 03:30:50,298
Shoot him, Edwards. 
He's standing there.

1249
03:30:50,757 --> 03:30:51,633
Shoot him!

1250
03:30:54,970 --> 03:30:57,055
Jesus Christ! Holy shit!

1251
03:31:01,643 --> 03:31:03,478
Bauer, get him off him!

1252
03:31:10,277 --> 03:31:11,820
He might have killed you.

1253
03:31:19,661 --> 03:31:21,162
I'll get that son of a bitch.

1254
03:31:27,752 --> 03:31:29,421
Sit down, goddamn it!

1255
03:31:41,766 --> 03:31:43,351
That's it. I got him!

1256
03:31:46,855 --> 03:31:48,982
Dead shot, boys. Come on.

1257
03:31:50,400 --> 03:31:51,943
Son of a bitch!

1258
03:31:52,527 --> 03:31:53,737
Get up!

1259
03:31:55,405 --> 03:31:56,489
Get up!

1260
03:31:58,033 --> 03:31:59,826
I mean it! Get up!

1261
03:31:59,910 --> 03:32:01,912
Get up! Come on, get up!

1262
03:32:02,454 --> 03:32:03,496
What?

1263
03:32:03,580 --> 03:32:06,833
You bash that prisoner one more time,
I'll put those shackles on you.

1264
03:32:07,876 --> 03:32:10,045
You men get back here!

1265
03:32:13,673 --> 03:32:15,050
Goddamn it!

1266
03:32:53,713 --> 03:32:54,631
Boo.

1267
03:33:03,181 --> 03:33:05,475
Clear behind that stand of trees?

1268
03:33:09,688 --> 03:33:11,439
All right. Let's go.

1269
03:33:34,963 --> 03:33:36,256
I don't see nobody.

1270
03:33:54,983 --> 03:33:56,193
Indians!

1271
03:37:38,832 --> 03:37:39,791
No.

1272
03:40:28,376 --> 03:40:33,048
'Dances With Wolves' is quiet these days.

1273
03:40:34,799 --> 03:40:37,302
Is his heart bad?

1274
03:40:46,394 --> 03:40:49,606
Killing the soldiers at the river ...

1275
03:40:52,067 --> 03:40:54,277
was a good thing.

1276
03:40:55,153 --> 03:40:58,073
I did not mind killing those men.
I was glad to do it.

1277
03:41:02,077 --> 03:41:07,832
But the soldiers hate me now,
like they hate no other.

1278
03:41:08,959 --> 03:41:12,254
They think I am a traitor.

1279
03:41:16,925 --> 03:41:20,345
And they will hunt for me.

1280
03:41:20,428 --> 03:41:24,641
And when they find me, 
they find you.

1281
03:41:26,101 --> 03:41:31,982
I think it would be wise 
to move the village now.

1282
03:41:38,947 --> 03:41:41,199
I will be leaving.

1283
03:41:43,618 --> 03:41:47,622
I must go and talk with 
those who would listen.

1284
03:41:56,464 --> 03:41:59,342
Quiet. You are hurting my ears.

1285
03:42:09,311 --> 03:42:11,980
Leave us alone.

1286
03:42:29,789 --> 03:42:33,835
You are the only white man 
I have ever known.

1287
03:42:33,919 --> 03:42:37,881
I have thought about you a lot.
More than you know.

1288
03:42:37,964 --> 03:42:41,760
But I think you are wrong.

1289
03:42:42,677 --> 03:42:45,764
The man the soldiers are 
looking for no longer exists.

1290
03:42:45,847 --> 03:42:52,270
Now there is only a Sioux
named 'Dances With Wolves'.

1291
03:42:56,191 --> 03:42:58,443
Let's smoke awhile.

1292
03:43:04,074 --> 03:43:06,910
"With 'Ten Bears', it was 
always more than a while.

1293
03:43:06,993 --> 03:43:10,789
"There was purpose in everything he did
and I knew he wanted me to stay.

1294
03:43:10,872 --> 03:43:12,541
"But I was sure of myself.

1295
03:43:12,624 --> 03:43:16,795
"I would be an excuse and that's all
the army would need to find this place.

1296
03:43:16,878 --> 03:43:19,548
"I pushed him as far as I could
to move the camp ...

1297
03:43:19,631 --> 03:43:23,009
"but in the end he only smiled
and talked of simple pleasures.

1298
03:43:23,093 --> 03:43:27,347
"He reminded me that at his age
a good fire is better than anything.

1299
03:43:27,764 --> 03:43:30,183
"'Ten Bears' was an extraordinary man."

1300
03:44:11,516 --> 03:44:13,393
You have nothing to say?

1301
03:44:15,770 --> 03:44:17,564
What can I tell you?

1302
03:44:19,232 --> 03:44:21,193
What's ever on your mind.

1303
03:44:27,824 --> 03:44:29,826
You've made the decision.

1304
03:44:34,289 --> 03:44:36,082
My place is with you.

1305
03:44:37,042 --> 03:44:38,710
I go where you go.

1306
03:44:42,255 --> 03:44:43,924
You're not afraid?

1307
03:44:45,008 --> 03:44:46,051
No.

1308
03:44:49,512 --> 03:44:52,599
I told 'Ten Bears' we'd leave 
when the snow breaks.

1309
03:44:59,731 --> 03:45:01,608
Did you tell everyone?

1310
03:45:05,654 --> 03:45:07,113
Not everyone.

1311
03:45:43,650 --> 03:45:45,902
It's all right.

1312
03:46:18,810 --> 03:46:20,186
You ...

1313
03:46:21,229 --> 03:46:22,772
finish your pipe?

1314
03:46:35,911 --> 03:46:37,204
Good pipe.

1315
03:46:38,705 --> 03:46:40,040
How ...

1316
03:46:40,582 --> 03:46:41,958
does it smoke?

1317
03:46:45,086 --> 03:46:46,630
I've never smoked it.

1318
03:46:58,433 --> 03:46:59,809
We come far ...

1319
03:47:00,227 --> 03:47:01,561
you and me.

1320
03:47:04,272 --> 03:47:06,149
I will not forget you.

1321
03:48:54,716 --> 03:48:57,344
'Dances With Wolves'.

1322
03:48:58,470 --> 03:49:01,139
I am 'Wind In His Hair'.

1323
03:49:01,223 --> 03:49:04,726
Do you see that I am your friend?

1324
03:49:08,730 --> 03:49:11,983
Can you see that you will 
always be my friend?

1325
03:50:39,654 --> 03:50:41,656
Sergeant! Over here! Now!
