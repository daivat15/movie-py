1
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:46,379
-Mr. Mills, how are you?
-l'm fine.

2
00:01:46,546 --> 00:01:47,674
-How are you?
-Fine.

3
00:01:47,966 --> 00:01:50,429
-l suppose you wanna see it again?
-lf you don't mind.

4
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,226
-You know where it is.
-Oh, yeah.

5
00:01:53,393 --> 00:01:56,733
lf l charged you a dollar every time
you came to examine the machine...

6
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,990
...you'd probably own it.
lt's the one all the pros use.

7
00:02:00,157 --> 00:02:02,578
Mariah Carey. Beyoncé. Gwen Stefani.

8
00:02:02,787 --> 00:02:04,875
Really? Who's Beyoncé?

9
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:07,630
Just kidding. l'll take it.

10
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:39,235
Excuse me, sir.
The adult party's in the front.

11
00:02:39,402 --> 00:02:42,032
-l'm Kim's father.
-Excuse me, l work for her father.

12
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:45,205
-Her real father.
-lt's okay, Cyril. l got it.

13
00:02:45,372 --> 00:02:47,502
-Hello, Bryan.
-Lenore.

14
00:02:49,213 --> 00:02:51,426
l just wanted to give Kim her present.

15
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,472
We're letting the kids
have their space.

16
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:56,561
-Put it with the others.
-l wanna give it to her myself.

17
00:02:56,728 --> 00:03:00,027
-Still having trouble following the rules.
-Oh, come on, Lennie.

18
00:03:00,152 --> 00:03:03,158
-l've asked you not to call me that.
-Excuse me. Lenore.

19
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,703
-Dad!
-Oh, my darling.

20
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,623
-Hi.
-Hello, my sweet.

21
00:03:06,957 --> 00:03:09,254
-Happy birthday.
-l was telling your father...

22
00:03:09,421 --> 00:03:12,051
-...how we arranged the presents.
-Here.

23
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:13,888
lt's bad manners to open the one...

24
00:03:14,055 --> 00:03:15,892
-...and not the others.
-Go on. Open it.

25
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,651
-Cool.
-A karaoke machine?

26
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:24,075
-Well, l figured she wants to be a singer.
-When she was 12, Bryan.

27
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:26,705
-We've moved on.
-Thank you, Daddy.

28
00:03:26,872 --> 00:03:28,500
My pleasure.

29
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,715
-l still wanna be a singer. Don't tell Mom.
-You got it.

30
00:03:31,882 --> 00:03:33,677
Here. One for the book.

31
00:03:33,844 --> 00:03:36,642
-We have a professional photographer.
-Big smile, sweetie.

32
00:03:37,268 --> 00:03:39,230
That's my girl.

33
00:03:46,369 --> 00:03:49,292
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

34
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:51,254
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

35
00:03:51,338 --> 00:03:52,507
Oh, my-- Stuart!

36
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,304
Stuart, l love you! l love you!
l love you!

37
00:03:55,596 --> 00:03:57,391
Happy birthday, sweetie.

38
00:04:08,288 --> 00:04:12,046
-Oh, Stuart, you're impossible.
-l know.

39
00:04:12,171 --> 00:04:13,841
-Hey, Bryan.
-Stuart.

40
00:04:14,426 --> 00:04:17,682
-She's not a little girl anymore, huh?
-l guess not.

41
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:20,980
-Will you join us for lunch?
-No, thanks.

42
00:04:21,147 --> 00:04:24,195
l just wanted to be here
to wish her a happy birthday.

43
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:27,368
-Good to see you, Bryan.
-You too.

44
00:04:41,897 --> 00:04:43,233
Thanks.

45
00:05:19,973 --> 00:05:21,101
-Hey.
-Hey.

46
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,023
You forgot.

47
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,860
Come on in.

48
00:05:26,027 --> 00:05:29,409
lt's not like l didn't call to remind you.
Third Saturday in May?

49
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:32,999
-Red meat, red wine? Sound familiar?
-He probably had a lot on his mind.

50
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,339
Yeah, the busy life of a retiree.
Every day a new adventure.

51
00:05:36,465 --> 00:05:39,888
What does a retiree do, anyway?
Take naps? Play golf?

52
00:05:40,055 --> 00:05:42,560
-Hit on rich widows?
-That takes care of the morning.

53
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:45,190
Yeah, well, come on, guys.
You know why l'm here.

54
00:05:45,357 --> 00:05:46,986
Yeah, how's that going?

55
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,031
Okay. We had her birthday today.

56
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,743
Can you believe my Kimmy's 17?

57
00:05:51,787 --> 00:05:53,624
Seventeen?

58
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:57,381
-To Kim.
-Lennie still got a hard-on for you?

59
00:05:58,175 --> 00:06:00,513
She's not Lennie anymore.
She's Lenore.

60
00:06:00,721 --> 00:06:02,266
Oh, she's still got a hard-on.

61
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:04,896
-And the husband?
-The same. Perfect.

62
00:06:05,063 --> 00:06:08,570
-Dig deep enough, there's always shit.
-We can dig if you want us to dig.

63
00:06:08,737 --> 00:06:11,075
What, you think he hasn't
done it already?

64
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:12,537
Thank you, Bernie.

65
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:15,543
-How's Kimmy?
-Good. She's good.

66
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:17,839
Yeah? She sleep over yet?

67
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,595
Well, let's say we're working on it.

68
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,227
She appreciate the fact
that you've given up your life...

69
00:06:24,394 --> 00:06:26,774
...in order to be closer to her?

70
00:06:27,316 --> 00:06:29,070
What a life, huh?

71
00:06:29,696 --> 00:06:32,159
Hey, remember Beirut
after the chief disappeared?

72
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,957
Bry was in deep with that
crazy sheik from Hezbollah?

73
00:06:35,124 --> 00:06:37,420
The guy said he'd get us inside
then disappeared.

74
00:06:37,545 --> 00:06:39,424
We're scrambling to get the hell out...

75
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:41,845
...before we get taken down
and where are you?

76
00:06:42,054 --> 00:06:43,849
l promised never to miss her birthday.

77
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:46,020
Yeah, that went down well
at Langley...

78
00:06:46,187 --> 00:06:48,442
...when they found out
you flew the coop...

79
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:51,323
...to attend your child's birthday
9000 miles away.

80
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,452
Where did you say
your next posting was?

81
00:06:53,702 --> 00:06:56,374
The Arctic Circle spying on penguins,
l believe it was.

82
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,211
No, penguins live in Antarctica.

83
00:06:58,337 --> 00:07:00,800
Actually, it was Alaska.
What's your point, Sam?

84
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:05,476
My point is we have an open space.
Say the word, it's yours.

85
00:07:07,438 --> 00:07:09,233
Who likes theirs rare?

86
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,029
-Guys.
-See you, Bryan.

87
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:13,492
-Good night, guys.
-See you, Bry.

88
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:15,663
Hey, look, look, look.
All kidding aside...

89
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,961
...it's a great thing trying to make up
for lost time with Kimmy.

90
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,965
But tomorrow's job? Right here.

91
00:07:21,258 --> 00:07:22,761
Four hours' work, 2500 bucks...

92
00:07:23,095 --> 00:07:26,017
...just for taking some pop diva
to and from her concert.

93
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:27,562
-We're one short.
-A singer?

94
00:07:27,854 --> 00:07:30,818
l don't know if you'd call her a singer.
More like a cash cow.

95
00:07:30,985 --> 00:07:33,824
Twenty million records sold already
and she's not even 25.

96
00:07:34,075 --> 00:07:35,453
Job's a piece of cake.

97
00:07:35,578 --> 00:07:38,626
We get her there and back.
lnside, they've got their own people.

98
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:40,922
-Okay.
-Okay. Okay?

99
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:42,258
-Yeah.
-Like that's it?

100
00:07:42,383 --> 00:07:43,552
Yeah.

101
00:07:43,844 --> 00:07:47,602
-lt'll be perfect. Just like old times.
-Better. No one gets killed.

102
00:07:48,312 --> 00:07:51,151
-Tomorrow. Good night, guys.
-See you.

103
00:07:51,318 --> 00:07:54,741
-Get in the back, Wendy.
-l always get in the back.

104
00:08:22,046 --> 00:08:24,676
Ma'am, if you don't mind,
l suggest you keep moving.

105
00:08:24,843 --> 00:08:26,847
My mother is ma'am,
if you don't mind.

106
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,277
-Come on, it's time now. Let's go.
-Okay.

107
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:37,535
Bernie, Casey, you're out here.
Bry, you're in the room.

108
00:08:37,702 --> 00:08:39,247
Okay.

109
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,171
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

110
00:08:43,213 --> 00:08:45,008
Thank you for coming.

111
00:08:58,995 --> 00:09:01,124
Wow, it was beautiful.

112
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,213
Thanks. What did you say
your name was again?

113
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,050
Mills. Bryan Mills.

114
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:08,889
-Nice to meet you, Bryan Mills.
-You too.

115
00:09:09,724 --> 00:09:12,981
-You're on. Come on, let's go now.
-Okay, guys.

116
00:09:13,148 --> 00:09:14,192
Excuse me, miss.

117
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:18,784
l've a daughter who wants to be a singer
and was wondering if you had any tips.

118
00:09:19,953 --> 00:09:21,581
Yeah, l do.

119
00:09:21,748 --> 00:09:23,878
Tell her to pick another career.

120
00:09:26,842 --> 00:09:29,055
l got one.
We're waiting on an air strike...

121
00:09:29,347 --> 00:09:32,144
...and we're waiting
and then my satellite phone rings.

122
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:33,272
-Who is it?
-Hello?

123
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,401
-The guy we're to terminate.
-Honey.

124
00:09:35,568 --> 00:09:38,449
-He'd like to know if we want some tea.
-Sorry, guys, it's Kim.

125
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:42,123
The noise?

126
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,335
l'm at a concert.

127
00:09:44,962 --> 00:09:47,592
You know this song? Yeah?

128
00:09:47,675 --> 00:09:50,890
Yep, that's her.
No, no, no, l'm not attending.

129
00:09:50,974 --> 00:09:52,435
l'm-- l'm not attending.

130
00:09:52,602 --> 00:09:55,232
l'm helping some friends out
with security.

131
00:09:55,524 --> 00:09:57,487
Well, of course l met her.

132
00:09:57,654 --> 00:09:59,449
Who do you think's guarding her?

133
00:09:59,616 --> 00:10:01,745
l'm glad you're impressed.

134
00:10:01,912 --> 00:10:04,041
Hey, l'm happy you called.

135
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:07,423
l'm happy you called. What?

136
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,886
Lunch? Tomorrow?

137
00:10:10,513 --> 00:10:13,769
Sure, sure. l know the place.

138
00:10:13,936 --> 00:10:16,191
Twelve-thirty it is.

139
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,320
l'll see you then.

140
00:10:18,946 --> 00:10:20,741
-Here he is. And...?
-What happened?

141
00:10:20,908 --> 00:10:22,704
-She wants to have lunch.
-Okay.

142
00:10:22,871 --> 00:10:25,167
-Just the two of us.
-All right. Fantastic.

143
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,004
See? There's progress. That's great.

144
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,996
Who left that gate open?
Bry, get her out of here. Take the lead.

145
00:10:44,163 --> 00:10:45,291
-Move!
-Go, go!

146
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,965
More security here now!

147
00:10:49,132 --> 00:10:50,718
That's it. Move.

148
00:10:57,315 --> 00:10:59,277
Casey!

149
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:02,993
Bernie, stand by, stand by.

150
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,247
-Go, go, go.
-Watch your head.

151
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,971
Here, take this. The sugar will
take the edge off the shock.

152
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:15,309
Come on, come on, drink some more.

153
00:11:24,577 --> 00:11:26,456
lt's okay. lt's okay. You're safe.

154
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,763
You're safe now.

155
00:11:36,226 --> 00:11:37,520
Bernie.

156
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:39,524
Casey. Rambo.

157
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:43,156
Seriously, Bry,
you should think about coming with us.

158
00:11:43,323 --> 00:11:45,787
You've got the edge.
There's more of this to be had.

159
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:47,916
-She's going to college next year?
-Yep.

160
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:51,214
-You're gonna lose her.
-That gives me a year to find her.

161
00:11:52,007 --> 00:11:54,846
Mr. Mills, she'd like to see you.

162
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:02,904
-How are you feeling?
-Better.

163
00:12:05,743 --> 00:12:07,538
So your daughter
wants to be a singer?

164
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:10,837
Yep, since she was 5.

165
00:12:11,004 --> 00:12:12,799
lt's not what everyone thinks it is.

166
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:18,143
Once the glam wears off, it's just
a lot of hotel rooms, lots of airports.

167
00:12:18,644 --> 00:12:19,729
lt's what she wants.

168
00:12:23,863 --> 00:12:26,034
The first number is Gio,
my vocal coach.

169
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:28,205
lf he says she can sing, she can sing.

170
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,960
He'll give her coaching she needs,
the fee is on me.

171
00:12:31,127 --> 00:12:33,090
The second number is my manager.

172
00:12:33,215 --> 00:12:35,887
lf Gio clears her,
he'll make sure she gets a shot.

173
00:12:37,766 --> 00:12:42,191
-Thank you.
-No, Mr. Mills, thank you.

174
00:12:58,474 --> 00:13:00,603
-There she is.
-Dad.

175
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:05,738
-Hi, sweetie.
-Hey.

176
00:13:06,114 --> 00:13:08,034
-Hi.
-Hi.

177
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:09,537
Don't look so excited.

178
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:13,253
l was just surprised.
l thought it was just gonna be Kim and l.

179
00:13:13,754 --> 00:13:14,965
l asked Mom to come.

180
00:13:17,094 --> 00:13:20,726
One raspberry-banana milkshake,
extra cherries, just the way you like it.

181
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:22,355
-Thanks.
-Lennie-- Lenore.

182
00:13:22,522 --> 00:13:25,319
-Would you like something?
-l'm fine, thanks.

183
00:13:25,778 --> 00:13:27,281
So?

184
00:13:27,782 --> 00:13:29,285
So, Dad, guess what.

185
00:13:29,452 --> 00:13:31,122
-You know my friend Amanda?
-Yep.

186
00:13:31,915 --> 00:13:35,047
Her cousins asked us to spend vacation
with them in Paris.

187
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,216
How cool is that?

188
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,846
-Why do you want to go to Paris?
-Dad. Hello?

189
00:13:39,013 --> 00:13:42,311
The Louvre, the lmpressionist museum,
the Picasso Museum.

190
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,315
l didn't know you were so into art.

191
00:13:44,482 --> 00:13:47,697
Are you kidding? l've been to the MOMA,
like, a hundred times.

192
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:52,582
Amanda went last summer, she came
back, she could practically speak French.

193
00:13:54,878 --> 00:13:56,339
And because you're under 18...

194
00:13:56,506 --> 00:13:59,471
...you need my permission
to leave the country?

195
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:03,395
Dad, please. l really, really wanna go.

196
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,401
They've got this
sick apartment overlooking the river.

197
00:14:06,568 --> 00:14:09,157
-Just you and Amanda?
-And her cousins.

198
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:12,455
Don't make a big deal out of this, Bryan.
Just sign the paper.

199
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,886
-What?
-l'm not comfortable with this.

200
00:14:20,095 --> 00:14:21,723
-Dad.
-l know the world, sweetie.

201
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,147
-Dad, please.
-A 17-year-old should not travel alone.

202
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:27,485
-l'm not gonna be alone.
-Two 17-year-olds.

203
00:14:27,694 --> 00:14:29,781
Amanda's 19.

204
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:37,881
How about this?
How about if l go along?

205
00:14:38,048 --> 00:14:40,845
You won't know l'm there.
l'm very good at being invisible.

206
00:14:41,012 --> 00:14:44,310
As you so amply demonstrated
for most of her life.

207
00:14:44,477 --> 00:14:46,106
Just sign the paper, Bryan.

208
00:14:49,362 --> 00:14:50,531
l'll think about it.

209
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,869
Everyone at this table
knows what that means.

210
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:56,293
Hey, Kimmy, there's something else.

211
00:14:57,128 --> 00:14:59,591
-l don't want anything else.
-Kim.

212
00:15:06,229 --> 00:15:07,523
-l don't get you.
-What?

213
00:15:08,317 --> 00:15:11,114
You sacrificed our marriage
in the service of the country.

214
00:15:11,281 --> 00:15:13,953
You made a mess of your life
in service of your country.

215
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,917
Can't you sacrifice a little
this time for your daughter?

216
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:20,048
-l would sacrifice anything for her.
-What's your problem?

217
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:23,555
l'm not comfortable
putting my daughter at risk.

218
00:15:23,848 --> 00:15:27,605
Putting our daughter at risk
by going to Paris?

219
00:15:27,897 --> 00:15:30,110
You're pathetic.

220
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:48,355
-She's coming.
-Thanks.

221
00:15:51,486 --> 00:15:52,530
Three conditions.

222
00:15:52,864 --> 00:15:55,494
The address and phone number
of where you're staying.

223
00:15:55,787 --> 00:15:58,751
You move, l wanna know where
and with whom you'll be staying.

224
00:15:58,918 --> 00:16:02,425
Call me when you land. Call me
every night before you go to sleep.

225
00:16:02,592 --> 00:16:04,429
lt's international. My number is in.

226
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,683
-Okay, awesome.
-Kimmy, you're not focused.

227
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,145
-l am.
-What did l say?

228
00:16:08,353 --> 00:16:11,652
You said call you when l land,
every night before l go to sleep...

229
00:16:11,777 --> 00:16:14,616
...your phone's international,
the number's programmed in.

230
00:16:14,783 --> 00:16:17,956
Okay, one last thing.
l get to take you to the airport.

231
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:19,542
Okay.

232
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:22,340
-There you go.
-Yes.

233
00:16:22,507 --> 00:16:25,847
Thank you, Daddy.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

234
00:16:26,014 --> 00:16:27,725
Mom!

235
00:16:29,813 --> 00:16:30,773
l love you, Dad.

236
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:35,157
Mom, he signed it, he signed it.
l'm gonna go call Amanda!

237
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:41,587
Wouldn't it have been easier
to sign the first time?

238
00:16:41,795 --> 00:16:45,261
Wouldn't it have been easier
if you and l had talked about it first?

239
00:16:49,436 --> 00:16:52,525
Certain areas in Paris you should avoid.
l've written them down.

240
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:53,986
-Dad.
-Come on, take it.

241
00:16:54,153 --> 00:16:57,953
We're gonna be spending 90 percent
of our time in museums. Don't worry.

242
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,875
That's like telling water
not to be wet, sweetie.

243
00:17:01,293 --> 00:17:03,046
Mom says
your job made you paranoid.

244
00:17:03,171 --> 00:17:04,883
Well, my job made me aware.

245
00:17:06,678 --> 00:17:10,144
l used to ask Mom what your job was
that you were away all the time.

246
00:17:10,311 --> 00:17:12,607
And she would tell me to ask you.

247
00:17:12,774 --> 00:17:16,448
Whenever l did see you,
l was afraid to ask.

248
00:17:16,615 --> 00:17:18,327
Yeah? Why?

249
00:17:19,203 --> 00:17:22,001
l don't know. Maybe because...

250
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:24,798
...l was afraid to find out.

251
00:17:26,635 --> 00:17:28,764
Like, maybe it was something
l wouldn't like.

252
00:17:29,474 --> 00:17:32,355
l worked for the government.
You knew that.

253
00:17:32,856 --> 00:17:37,114
So you were like a spy, right?

254
00:17:37,281 --> 00:17:40,788
-What happens if l push this button?
-Don't touch that button.

255
00:17:41,498 --> 00:17:46,884
Well, no, l was a--
l was a preventer, actually.

256
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:48,846
-A preventer?
-Yeah.

257
00:17:49,472 --> 00:17:51,017
What did you prevent?

258
00:17:51,184 --> 00:17:53,313
Bad things from happening.

259
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:57,781
So it was a good job?

260
00:17:57,948 --> 00:18:00,870
Yes. Yep, it was.

261
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,878
Do you miss it?

262
00:18:05,379 --> 00:18:06,548
l missed you more.

263
00:18:22,664 --> 00:18:24,083
-Kim!
-Dad, there's Amanda.

264
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:25,962
Go ahead. l'll get the bags.

265
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:50,469
-Jimmy'll give you a hand with those.
-l can manage.

266
00:18:50,553 --> 00:18:52,014
Lenore.

267
00:18:52,181 --> 00:18:54,978
Do you know about this?
She's not just going to Paris.

268
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:57,275
-l know.
-She lied to me.

269
00:18:57,442 --> 00:18:59,738
Yes, because she can't be honest
with you.

270
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:01,992
Why? What are you talking about?

271
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:03,746
Your rules and conditions.

272
00:19:03,913 --> 00:19:05,291
What is this?

273
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,171
lt's U2's European tour dates.

274
00:19:08,338 --> 00:19:10,468
She's following a rock band
around Europe?

275
00:19:10,593 --> 00:19:14,225
All kids do. Stuart got her tickets,
arranged her to stay in the best hotels.

276
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,565
Best hotels. You know,
you live in your little bubble here...

277
00:19:17,732 --> 00:19:21,030
...behind your wall, with your maids
and chauffeurs and servants.

278
00:19:21,156 --> 00:19:22,784
No idea what the world is like.

279
00:19:22,951 --> 00:19:26,667
Yes, and neither will she
unless she goes out and experiences it.

280
00:19:29,088 --> 00:19:30,883
Don't tell me l don't know the world.

281
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:35,058
For five years l waited for a phone call
that didn't come for weeks at a time.

282
00:19:35,225 --> 00:19:38,190
For a knock on the door
telling me there'd be no calls anymore.

283
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:46,540
Listen, l know you moved here to build
some sort of relationship with Kimmy.

284
00:19:46,707 --> 00:19:49,462
But you're not gonna do that
by smothering her.

285
00:19:49,546 --> 00:19:53,178
Let her live, or l promise,
l promise you'll lose her.

286
00:20:00,109 --> 00:20:01,111
Girls.

287
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,958
Kim!

288
00:20:13,928 --> 00:20:15,013
l love you.

289
00:20:16,892 --> 00:20:19,188
Let's go. Come on.

290
00:20:31,379 --> 00:20:33,049
l'll teach you the French words
l know.

291
00:20:33,175 --> 00:20:35,888
-Which may not be that much, but--
-Okay. Yeah, right.

292
00:20:40,898 --> 00:20:42,902
Three. Okay, now take one--

293
00:20:43,069 --> 00:20:44,906
Need some help?
One with the two of you?

294
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:47,537
Yes, please.

295
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,708
-Okay.
-He's really cute.

296
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,630
Okay. Yeah, great. Very nice.

297
00:20:52,797 --> 00:20:53,799
Where are you from?

298
00:20:54,342 --> 00:20:56,096
California.

299
00:21:01,982 --> 00:21:02,984
No. l'm Peter.

300
00:21:08,913 --> 00:21:10,750
-This is Kim.
-Hi.

301
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:12,086
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

302
00:21:12,253 --> 00:21:13,631
Hey.

303
00:21:13,881 --> 00:21:16,219
You're going into Paris?

304
00:21:17,012 --> 00:21:19,476
You know, taxis here
are so damned expensive.

305
00:21:19,643 --> 00:21:20,686
Want to share?

306
00:21:20,937 --> 00:21:22,774
-Yeah. Sure.
-Okay, perfect.

307
00:21:22,857 --> 00:21:24,736
Thanks.

<i>Please enter the flight number.</i>

311

312
00:21:43,064 --> 00:21:44,400
Yeah.

313
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:47,072
Oh, are you serious?

314
00:21:47,323 --> 00:21:49,536
-Oh, my God.
-Nice address.

315
00:21:49,703 --> 00:21:51,039
Oh, yeah, thanks.

316
00:21:51,206 --> 00:21:55,423
lt's my cousins', but they're in Madrid,
so we have the whole place to ourselves.

317
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,093
How cool is that?

318
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,932
-l didn't know that.
-lt's no biggie.

319
00:22:00,182 --> 00:22:02,144
Well, l have to be going.

320
00:22:02,311 --> 00:22:04,023
-Nice to meet you.
-Oh, okay.

321
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,276
-You too.
-Bye.

322
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:07,447
Hey.

323
00:22:08,282 --> 00:22:11,037
There is a party tonight at school.
Want to come?

324
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,958
-Sure. Yeah.
-We don't even know him.

325
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,254
What is there to know? He's hot.

326
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:17,550
-l come pick you up around 9?
-Okay, yeah.

327
00:22:17,842 --> 00:22:19,805
Okay, great. Your apartment?

328
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:23,604
-lt's the whole fifth floor. Hoffmann.
-Okay. See you tonight. Bye.

329
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:25,316
Bye.

330
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:34,876
Yeah.

331
00:22:35,962 --> 00:22:36,922
Fifth floor.

332
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,636
Two girls around 18.

333
00:22:41,932 --> 00:22:44,061
Oh, my God.

334
00:22:44,228 --> 00:22:47,360
-How sick is this?
-Are you kidding me? lt's great.

335
00:22:47,652 --> 00:22:50,366
l just wish you would've told me
they weren't gonna be here.

336
00:22:50,616 --> 00:22:53,288
-What's the difference?
-l told my dad they'd be here.

337
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,752
You told your dad you were
going to museums too.

338
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,714
Oh, come on. He's not gonna know.

339
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,803
-l'm gonna sleep with him.
-Who?

340
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:02,390
-Peter.
-You just met him.

341
00:23:02,974 --> 00:23:05,980
l hear French guys are amazing in bed.

342
00:23:06,147 --> 00:23:08,444
-Maybe he has a friend, huh?
-No.

343
00:23:08,611 --> 00:23:09,905
-No.
-Oh, come on.

344
00:23:10,072 --> 00:23:13,871
You gotta lose it sometime.
Might as well be in Paris.

345
00:23:18,338 --> 00:23:19,466
Hey!

346
00:23:39,297 --> 00:23:41,426
-Amanda, where's the bathroom?
-What?

347
00:23:41,593 --> 00:23:42,720
l have to pee!

348
00:24:08,773 --> 00:24:10,902
-Hello?
-lt's me. Has Kim called you?

349
00:24:11,403 --> 00:24:15,870
Bryan, she's 17. She's in Paris.
Give her some space.

350
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,500
<i>She'll call. Take a sleeping pill.</i>

351
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:20,755
Have a drink or something. Good night.

352
00:24:21,632 --> 00:24:23,552
Good night.

353
00:24:39,626 --> 00:24:40,753
Hi, Daddy.

354
00:24:41,755 --> 00:24:43,509
Kim.

355
00:24:45,012 --> 00:24:47,600
What did l say?
You were supposed to call me.

356
00:24:47,809 --> 00:24:48,769
l'm sorry.

357
00:24:48,936 --> 00:24:51,149
<i>I thought something was wrong
with the phone.</i>

358
00:24:51,316 --> 00:24:54,030
-No. lt was such a rush at the airport.
-All right.

359
00:24:54,238 --> 00:24:56,910
Well, if l'd had the number
where you were staying...

360
00:24:57,036 --> 00:24:58,747
<i>...I would've just called there.</i>

361
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,000
<i>What's the number?</i>

362
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:02,672
<i>-I don't have it.
-Kimmy, come on.</i>

363
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:05,678
<i>This is one of the conditions.
Let me talk to the cousins.</i>

364
00:25:05,845 --> 00:25:07,473
<i>I'll get it from them.</i>

365
00:25:07,766 --> 00:25:11,398
Dad, they're in Spain.
l didn't know. l swear.

366
00:25:12,024 --> 00:25:13,652
To Spain?

367
00:25:14,821 --> 00:25:18,328
Kim, is there anything else
you want to tell me?

368
00:25:21,752 --> 00:25:23,631
Kimmy.

369
00:25:27,597 --> 00:25:30,519
-There's someone here.
-The cousins are back?

370
00:25:30,686 --> 00:25:32,482
No.

371
00:25:33,317 --> 00:25:35,738
-Oh, my God. They got Amanda.
-What?

372
00:25:36,281 --> 00:25:38,535
<i>What are you talking about? Kimmy?</i>

373
00:25:38,577 --> 00:25:39,955
<i>-Dad.
-Kim.</i>

374
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,838
<i>-Kim.
-Dad. They took her.</i>

375
00:25:44,005 --> 00:25:46,301
<i>-They took her.
-All right, listen to me.</i>

376
00:25:46,468 --> 00:25:47,971
Oh, God.

377
00:25:48,096 --> 00:25:50,726
-Did you meet anyone on the plane?
-No.

378
00:25:50,893 --> 00:25:53,899
-ln the airport?
-No. Yes, Peter.

379
00:25:54,108 --> 00:25:55,736
<i>-Peter? Peter who?
-I don't know.</i>

380
00:25:56,029 --> 00:25:57,031
<i>-An American?
-No.</i>

381
00:25:57,198 --> 00:25:59,327
Did he know where you were staying?

382
00:25:59,494 --> 00:26:00,955
He took a cab with us.

383
00:26:03,502 --> 00:26:06,592
Dad, they're coming.

384
00:26:07,134 --> 00:26:09,890
<i>-Please, I'm scared.
-l know you are.</i>

385
00:26:10,057 --> 00:26:12,353
Stay focused, Kimmy.
You have to hold it together.

386
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,065
How many people are there?

387
00:26:14,232 --> 00:26:16,779
-Three, four. l don't know.
-Where are you?

388
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:20,787
-l'm in the bathroom.
-Go to the next bedroom.

389
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:23,709
Get under the bed.
Tell me when you're there.

390
00:26:32,184 --> 00:26:35,566
-l'm here.
-Now, the next part is very important.

391
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:42,705
They are going to take you.
Kim, stay focused, baby. This is key.

392
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,379
You will have five, maybe ten seconds.
Very important seconds.

393
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:49,135
<i>Leave the phone on the floor.
Concentrate.</i>

394
00:26:49,177 --> 00:26:53,268
Shout out everything you see about them.
Hair color, eye color, tall, short, scars.

395
00:26:53,435 --> 00:26:55,857
Anything you see. You understand?

396
00:26:59,656 --> 00:27:01,284
They're there. l can hear them.

397
00:27:01,493 --> 00:27:03,163
<i>Remember, concentrate.</i>

398
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,151
Put the phone closer so l can hear.

399
00:27:43,368 --> 00:27:46,374
They're leaving. l think they're--

400
00:27:50,382 --> 00:27:55,225
<i>Beard. Six feet.
Tattoo right hand, moon and star.</i>

401
00:28:15,683 --> 00:28:18,313
l don't know who you are.

402
00:28:19,775 --> 00:28:21,904
l don't know what you want.

403
00:28:22,029 --> 00:28:25,912
lf you are looking for a ransom,
l can tell you, l don't have money.

404
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:30,504
But what l do have
are a very particular set of skills.

405
00:28:30,671 --> 00:28:33,594
Skills l've acquired
over a very long career.

406
00:28:33,761 --> 00:28:37,602
Skills that make me a nightmare
for people like you.

407
00:28:38,103 --> 00:28:41,526
lf you let my daughter go now,
that'll be the end of it.

408
00:28:41,693 --> 00:28:45,493
l will not look for you.
l will not pursue you.

409
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:49,459
But if you don't, l will look for you.

410
00:28:49,626 --> 00:28:52,423
l will find you...

411
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,886
...and l will kill you.

412
00:28:58,686 --> 00:29:00,690
<i>Good luck.</i>

413
00:29:11,962 --> 00:29:14,008
Sam, it's me. l need a favor.

414
00:29:14,175 --> 00:29:18,267
l'm gonna download something.
l need it analyzed. Right now.

415
00:29:19,102 --> 00:29:20,605
-She's been taken.
-What?

416
00:29:20,772 --> 00:29:23,193
-Any enemies overseas?
-Why would l have enemies?

417
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,324
You do business overseas
through multiple shell corporations.

418
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:30,165
You were involved in an oil deal with
a bunch of Russians that went south.

419
00:29:30,332 --> 00:29:33,130
-How do you know that?
-l was not gonna let my daughter...

420
00:29:33,297 --> 00:29:36,052
...live with someone without knowing
everything about them.

421
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:39,392
-l have a few resources--
-Now is not the time for dick measuring.

422
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:41,688
-Anyone looking to hurt you?
-Not that l know.

423
00:29:41,855 --> 00:29:43,818
-Which room's Kim's?
-What happened?

424
00:29:43,985 --> 00:29:47,492
l got a call from her. There were people
in the apartment. She was taken.

425
00:29:47,742 --> 00:29:48,995
-Oh, God.
-Which one?

426
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,790
That one.

427
00:29:55,048 --> 00:29:56,844
ls there something l should be doing?

428
00:29:57,011 --> 00:29:59,975
You have a lease agreement
with NetJet through your company.

429
00:30:00,184 --> 00:30:01,645
l do.

430
00:30:02,229 --> 00:30:04,108
-Get me a plane to Paris.
-For when?

431
00:30:04,275 --> 00:30:05,361
An hour ago.

432
00:30:05,569 --> 00:30:08,868
-l'm gonna make the call. You all right?
-Yeah, yeah. l'm okay.

433
00:30:17,635 --> 00:30:21,059
Would you please
get her back to me, Bryan?

434
00:30:21,727 --> 00:30:23,021
First l have to find her.

435
00:30:27,196 --> 00:30:29,826
Sam, what have you got?

436
00:30:29,993 --> 00:30:31,288
<i>They're speaking Albanian.</i>

437
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:34,920
Based on their accents and dialects,
they must be from Tropoja.

438
00:30:35,087 --> 00:30:36,840
<i>The place is ground zero
for scummers.</i>

439
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:39,220
<i>Even the Russians
give these guys a wide berth.</i>

440
00:30:39,888 --> 00:30:42,184
The one you spoke to,
his name is Marko.

441
00:30:42,477 --> 00:30:44,314
We have information
that a mobster boss...

442
00:30:44,481 --> 00:30:47,779
...by the name of Marko Hoxha
moved to Paris about six months ago.

443
00:30:47,988 --> 00:30:53,707
<i>If he's the one, he's a big fish.
The tattoo, by the way, is a group ID.</i>

444
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:56,839
<i>-Am I on speaker or are you by yourself?
-Lenore is here.</i>

445
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,262
<i>-Hey, Lennie.
-Hello, Sam.</i>

446
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:01,807
She needs to hear it, Sam.

447
00:31:02,725 --> 00:31:06,733
The specialty of the groups coming out
of this area is trafficking in women.

448
00:31:10,407 --> 00:31:12,620
-Keep going.
-Okay.

449
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:17,547
Their previous m.o. was to offer women
from emerging East European countries...

450
00:31:17,756 --> 00:31:21,847
<i>...like Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria,
jobs in the West as maids and nannies.</i>

451
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:26,314
Once smuggled in, they'd addict them
to drugs and turn them into prostitutes.

452
00:31:27,817 --> 00:31:30,782
Lately, however, they've decided
that it's more economical...

453
00:31:30,949 --> 00:31:35,792
...just to kidnap traveling young women.
Saves on transportation costs.

454
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:38,338
Oh, my little baby.

455
00:31:38,505 --> 00:31:40,175
What else?

456
00:31:40,301 --> 00:31:43,348
Based on the way these groups operate,
our analyst says...

457
00:31:43,474 --> 00:31:46,271
...you have a 96-hour window
from the time she was grabbed.

458
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:49,026
-To what?
-To never finding her.

459
00:31:49,193 --> 00:31:52,325
No, no, no.

460
00:31:52,492 --> 00:31:54,036
<i>Daddy!</i>

461
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:58,629
<i>Mustache. Six feet.
Tattoo on right hand, moon and star.</i>

462
00:31:58,796 --> 00:32:00,424
<i>Da--</i>

463
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:09,192
<i>Good luck.</i>

464
00:32:12,114 --> 00:32:13,784
<i>Good luck.</i>

465
00:32:15,496 --> 00:32:16,957
<i>Good luck.</i>

466
00:32:18,753 --> 00:32:19,880
<i>Good luck.</i>

467
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,498
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

468
00:34:02,794 --> 00:34:04,506
<i>Dad, they got Amanda.</i>

469
00:34:15,611 --> 00:34:16,613
<i>Oh, God.</i>

470
00:34:17,448 --> 00:34:20,705
<i>Dad, they got her.</i>

471
00:34:23,627 --> 00:34:24,713
<i>They took her.</i>

472
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:27,009
<i>Go to the next bedroom.
Get under the bed.</i>

473
00:34:27,343 --> 00:34:30,641
<i>-Tell me when you're there.
-I'm here.</i>

474
00:34:36,737 --> 00:34:39,659
<i>Stay focused, baby.
Leave the phone on the floor.</i>

475
00:34:39,826 --> 00:34:42,290
<i>Concentrate. Shout out
everything you see about them.</i>

476
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:46,298
<i>Hair color, eye color, tall, short, scars.
Anything you see. You understand?</i>

477
00:34:46,548 --> 00:34:49,429
<i>They're there. I can hear them.
Remember, concentrate.</i>

478
00:35:02,622 --> 00:35:05,544
<i>They're leaving. Daddy!</i>

479
00:35:08,509 --> 00:35:09,719
<i>Dad!</i>

480
00:35:10,763 --> 00:35:14,103
Beard. Six feet.
Tattoo right hand, moon and star.

481
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:15,940
Dad!

482
00:36:57,727 --> 00:36:58,896
-Hi.
-Hi.

483
00:36:59,105 --> 00:37:00,691
-l'm Peter.
-l'm lngrid.

484
00:37:00,858 --> 00:37:02,111
-On holidays?
-Yes.

485
00:37:02,278 --> 00:37:03,990
-Me too.
-Cool.

486
00:37:04,157 --> 00:37:06,662
Cabs here are so damned expensive.
Want to share?

487
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:09,125
-Sure. Why not?
-Great.

488
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,300
-Excuse me.
-Hey.

489
00:37:15,972 --> 00:37:17,224
-Hey.
-Drive.

490
00:37:19,813 --> 00:37:22,485
-The two American girls from yesterday?
-l don't know.

491
00:37:23,278 --> 00:37:27,286
The next rib drives into your lungs.
The two American girls, where are they?

492
00:39:29,071 --> 00:39:32,036
-Just like the old days.
-Would you have it any other way?

493
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,747
Between you and me? No.

494
00:39:33,873 --> 00:39:37,171
But now that l sit behind a desk,
the world looks different.

495
00:39:37,338 --> 00:39:39,634
-You mean, looks boring.
-l mean different.

496
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:44,227
Okay, a little boring. But is being retired
any more interesting?

497
00:39:44,394 --> 00:39:47,817
lt wasn't. Until my daughter
disappeared in Paris yesterday.

498
00:39:47,984 --> 00:39:51,992
She and her friend were marked by a
spotter at the airport. Albanians took her.

499
00:39:52,034 --> 00:39:54,330
-How do you know this?
-l'm retired, not dead.

500
00:39:54,915 --> 00:39:57,378
And l assume you don't want
to go to the police.

501
00:39:57,545 --> 00:40:00,259
l was told l have 96 hours.
That was 16 hours ago.

502
00:40:00,426 --> 00:40:04,225
-Okay, first, we should find the spotter.
-l found him, he's dead.

503
00:40:06,313 --> 00:40:09,110
You found him that way?

504
00:40:11,782 --> 00:40:15,080
Bryan, you cannot just run around
tearing down Paris--

505
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:17,543
l'll tear down the Eiffel Tower
if l have to.

506
00:40:17,543 --> 00:40:20,341
-Don't forget who you talk to.
-l'm talking to a friend.

507
00:40:20,508 --> 00:40:25,559
You are. But please remember,
your friend has a desk now.

508
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:29,233
''Deputy director, lnternal Security.''
Very impressive.

509
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,363
The Albanians?

510
00:40:31,655 --> 00:40:34,494
They showed up from the East,
six, seven years ago.

511
00:40:34,703 --> 00:40:36,999
Fifteen, 20 of them.
Now there are hundreds.

512
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:39,838
We don't even know how many.
And dangerous.

513
00:40:40,005 --> 00:40:42,761
So l heard. Where do l find them?

514
00:40:42,928 --> 00:40:49,190
The best place to start is Porte de Clichy.
Bryan, try not to make a mess.

515
00:40:53,341 --> 00:40:55,765
I need an agent to follow somebody.

516
00:41:10,822 --> 00:41:16,115
Little Red Riding Hood said to the wolf,
"Grand-ma! What big arms you have"!

517
00:41:16,323 --> 00:41:19,324
- And the wolf replied...
- Jean Claude, it's your assistant.

518
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:25,823
Yes?

519
00:41:25,824 --> 00:41:28,866
He went to the Interim branch
and rented a car.

520
00:41:28,908 --> 00:41:31,617
- That's all?
- Yes, nothing else happening.

521
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:34,323
With him it doesn't take long,
don't be fooled.

522
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:55,114
-Gregor Milocivic?
-Yes. Yes, l am Gregor.

523
00:41:55,448 --> 00:41:57,744
l'm Mr. Smith. Get in.

524
00:42:02,378 --> 00:42:03,839
Here is my résumé.

525
00:42:03,881 --> 00:42:06,762
The employment agency said
we would be doing translations.

526
00:42:06,804 --> 00:42:09,810
Yes. Albanian to English.
You do speak Albanian?

527
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:13,108
Albanian, Serbian, Croatian.
l was a teacher in primary school...

528
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:16,072
-...before the war began in Pristina--
-What's your rate?

529
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:17,533
My rate?

530
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,957
lt is 25 per hour for the first three hours
and then it goes up--

531
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,798
Okay. Now, here's for 10 hours.
Wait here.

532
00:42:25,883 --> 00:42:29,390
Mr. Smith, l do not understand.
What is the job exactly?

533
00:42:29,683 --> 00:42:31,854
Right now the job is to wait here.

534
00:42:39,953 --> 00:42:41,414
Good evening.

535
00:42:41,623 --> 00:42:45,715
-Hi. Looking for a date?
-l love your dress. ls that silk?

536
00:42:46,049 --> 00:42:48,053
l don't know.
You want to know the prices?

537
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,015
Just the way it falls, it must be silk.

538
00:42:50,182 --> 00:42:53,606
How it compliments
the natural curves of your body.

539
00:42:53,773 --> 00:42:55,735
The rate is 40 euros for the standard.

540
00:42:55,902 --> 00:42:57,739
Standard? Could you be more specific?

541
00:42:58,031 --> 00:43:00,661
Back home, the standard covers
a range of possibilities.

542
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,166
Like kissing,
you know, closed lips, open lips.

543
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:06,423
-lf you're not buying, piss off.
-l didn't say l wasn't buying.

544
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:08,719
l like to get comfortable
before l purchase.

545
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:10,723
Like this karaoke machine l bought.

546
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:14,564
l must have read that manual
from cover to cover so many times.

547
00:43:14,731 --> 00:43:18,155
l don't give a shit. You're gonna
get me in trouble if you don't buy.

548
00:43:18,322 --> 00:43:20,618
-Trouble? Really? With who?
-Piss off.

549
00:43:20,785 --> 00:43:23,457
Okay, okay. Listen, l'm sorry.

550
00:43:23,499 --> 00:43:26,755
lf l want a package deal,
do l get a discount?

551
00:43:27,381 --> 00:43:30,680
-You cost me two now.
-My name's Bryan.

552
00:43:31,682 --> 00:43:34,604
-Oh, God. You better leave.
-l thought we were negotiating.

553
00:43:35,523 --> 00:43:37,276
Anton, l swear, it's not my fault.

554
00:43:37,485 --> 00:43:40,240
-l told him--
-Why are you bothering the girl?

555
00:43:40,574 --> 00:43:42,745
-None of your business.
-She is my business.

556
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:45,543
And if you're not spending money,
you're costing money.

557
00:43:45,835 --> 00:43:48,549
-l was negotiating.
-No negotiating. Price is the price.

558
00:43:48,716 --> 00:43:50,636
Now you owe me
for two that got away.

559
00:43:50,803 --> 00:43:52,974
l don't owe you nothing.

560
00:43:54,603 --> 00:43:57,734
-Fifty euros or l kick your ass.
-Sure, sure, okay.

561
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:59,696
Chill.

562
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,625
Okay. Here's your 50.

563
00:44:06,418 --> 00:44:10,384
And another 50 for being an asshole.
Now get the hell out of here.

564
00:44:10,551 --> 00:44:13,265
lf l see you again, l'll kill you.

565
00:44:19,152 --> 00:44:22,993
Mr. Smith, l do not know what kind of
job l'm supposed to do for you, but--

566
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:26,082
-You are to translate.
-Yes. But translate what?

567
00:44:26,249 --> 00:44:28,211
This.

568
00:44:35,476 --> 00:44:36,895
Translate.

569
00:44:37,647 --> 00:44:40,569
-They're talking about you.
-What about me?

570
00:44:40,736 --> 00:44:43,367
-They're not saying nice things.
-Be specific.

571
00:44:43,534 --> 00:44:47,041
They're saying-- Excuse me, Mr. Smith.
--what an asshole you are.

572
00:44:48,627 --> 00:44:51,299
Please, if you can explain to me
why we're doing this--

573
00:44:51,466 --> 00:44:53,095
Just translate.

574
00:44:53,262 --> 00:44:56,059
One of them says,
the sausage gave him heartburn.

575
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:57,437
Keep going.

576
00:44:57,562 --> 00:45:02,029
The other one is suggesting something
his grandmother used to give him.

577
00:45:02,196 --> 00:45:05,787
-Do you really want to hear all this?
-Every word.

578
00:45:06,956 --> 00:45:11,005
Now they're talking about football.
The game between Lazio and Marseille.

579
00:45:11,089 --> 00:45:13,009
And they lost money on the betting.

580
00:45:13,176 --> 00:45:17,811
-Perhaps if l knew the purpose--
-You're better off not knowing.

581
00:45:17,978 --> 00:45:20,274
ls it still football?

582
00:45:20,441 --> 00:45:22,403
One is on the phone.

583
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:24,783
He has to do a job
at the construction site.

584
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:28,039
Something about fresh merchandise
giving problems.

585
00:45:28,206 --> 00:45:30,503
Mr. Smith,
l do not understand any of this.

586
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:33,676
You're not supposed to. Goodbye.

587
00:45:34,845 --> 00:45:38,769
l asked for an English-Albanian
dictionary, did you bring one?

588
00:45:41,065 --> 00:45:42,193
Thank you.

589
00:47:20,389 --> 00:47:21,433
l love you.

590
00:47:37,131 --> 00:47:39,177
Where did you get this?

591
00:47:39,427 --> 00:47:41,389
Where did you get this?

592
00:47:41,723 --> 00:47:44,562
-l'm good.
-Who gave this to you?

593
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:49,071
-Who--? Who gave this to you?
-l'm good.

594
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,079
Hey.

595
00:48:17,128 --> 00:48:18,631
Hey.

596
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,830
Come on.

597
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,070
I told you
he wouldn't stay quiet for long.

598
00:51:19,112 --> 00:51:20,237
Okay, so what're we gonna do now?

599
00:51:20,279 --> 00:51:23,404
Now since he's started this mess,
it wont be long before it's finished!

600
00:51:41,073 --> 00:51:41,948
Oh shit!

601
00:52:15,479 --> 00:52:17,275
Monsieur Allen, how are you?

602
00:52:17,442 --> 00:52:19,237
Hello, Gilles. How's the wife?

603
00:52:19,571 --> 00:52:21,074
Well, still in charge.

604
00:52:21,241 --> 00:52:23,913
-Been a long time since l've seen you.
-Way too long.

605
00:52:24,497 --> 00:52:26,668
-The usual accommodation?
-Plus one.

606
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:14,467
Yes?

607
00:54:14,634 --> 00:54:17,098
<i>-We need to talk.
-l'm listening.</i>

608
00:54:19,394 --> 00:54:21,356
Well, can't you come
and meet me first?

609
00:54:21,523 --> 00:54:23,068
l can't see you. Where are you?

610
00:54:23,402 --> 00:54:25,990
l can see you and hear you very well.

611
00:54:26,867 --> 00:54:29,289
You can tell them
to stop jogging now.

612
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:32,784
We'll get his cell phone signal
with your connection.

613
00:54:32,785 --> 00:54:36,270
Okay, we're good,
we got his cell phone signal.

614
00:54:37,555 --> 00:54:39,684
Didn't think
l was gonna come down, did you?

615
00:54:39,851 --> 00:54:42,148
l didn't think you were gonna
make such a mess.

616
00:54:42,315 --> 00:54:44,319
l didn't have time to worry
about neatness.

617
00:54:44,486 --> 00:54:47,617
<i>-I know. You have 7 0 hours.
-Now l have 56.</i>

618
00:54:49,245 --> 00:54:50,915
No, now you have none.

619
00:54:51,207 --> 00:54:54,506
My chief wanted to arrest you,
l convinced him to send you home.

620
00:54:55,174 --> 00:55:00,058
<i>Air France 001 leaves today at 2.
First class.</i>

621
00:55:00,225 --> 00:55:03,273
Courtesy of the French government
for past services rendered.

622
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:10,120
-And what about my daughter?
-l told you, l sit behind a desk now.

623
00:55:10,204 --> 00:55:13,460
<i>I take my orders from someone
who sits behind a bigger desk.</i>

624
00:55:13,627 --> 00:55:17,427
Come on, seven dead bodies,
three in hospital, a building destroyed.

625
00:55:17,594 --> 00:55:18,888
<i>Total chaos at the airport.</i>

626
00:55:19,055 --> 00:55:22,395
He wanted your ass in chains.
lt's the best l could do, l'm sorry.

627
00:55:22,562 --> 00:55:25,150
Sorry doesn't cut it, Jean-Claude.
Not this time.

628
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:31,246
You can't beat the state, Bryan.
You know that.

629
00:55:31,413 --> 00:55:34,001
l'm not trying to.
l'm trying to save my daughter.

630
00:55:34,168 --> 00:55:35,755
lt was a trailer, not a building.

631
00:56:16,253 --> 00:56:17,589
No, no, no. Leave it.

632
00:56:18,549 --> 00:56:20,261
lt's all right, it's fluids.

633
00:56:20,386 --> 00:56:22,515
And medication
to counteract the drugs.

634
00:56:23,225 --> 00:56:24,519
lt's all right.

635
00:56:27,609 --> 00:56:28,736
Where'd you get this?

636
00:56:29,446 --> 00:56:31,575
Where did you get this jacket?

637
00:56:32,911 --> 00:56:34,080
Did you get it from her?

638
00:56:34,706 --> 00:56:36,627
Was it from this girl?

639
00:56:38,881 --> 00:56:40,635
l didn't steal it.

640
00:56:40,802 --> 00:56:44,476
-l was cold, she gave it to me.
-Where? Where did she give it to you?

641
00:56:46,187 --> 00:56:48,567
-ln the house.
-What house?

642
00:56:49,736 --> 00:56:51,364
The house with the red door.

643
00:56:54,496 --> 00:56:55,790
Sorry.

644
00:57:00,758 --> 00:57:04,056
He said it was a party.

645
00:57:05,184 --> 00:57:07,480
The girl who gave you this,
was she in the house?

646
00:57:12,657 --> 00:57:14,369
She was nice.

647
00:57:14,536 --> 00:57:16,080
l know.

648
00:57:17,082 --> 00:57:18,544
She's my daughter.

649
00:57:23,637 --> 00:57:26,351
l need to find this house.
Do you know where it is?

650
00:57:33,198 --> 00:57:34,242
Paradise.

651
00:57:50,357 --> 00:57:51,986
-Good morning.
-May l help you?

652
00:57:52,153 --> 00:57:54,324
-l'm here to see your boss.
-No boss.

653
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:02,006
We're doing nothing wrong here.

654
00:58:03,383 --> 00:58:05,346
One button,
and 30 agents will be here...

655
00:58:05,513 --> 00:58:07,767
...before you have time
to scratch your balls.

656
00:58:07,934 --> 00:58:11,149
Stop jerking around before
l close you down for wasting my time.

657
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,372
Wait here.

658
00:58:31,231 --> 00:58:32,275
You have weapon?

659
00:58:32,859 --> 00:58:33,986
You're holding it.

660
00:59:02,418 --> 00:59:03,879
Black, one sugar, please.

661
00:59:11,144 --> 00:59:12,229
What is it you want?

662
00:59:13,732 --> 00:59:15,402
l'm here to negotiate the rates.

663
00:59:15,736 --> 00:59:18,868
We already negotiated the rate
with Mr. Macon.

664
00:59:18,993 --> 00:59:22,166
Mr. Macon has moved
to another division.

665
00:59:22,333 --> 00:59:24,170
l'm here for the renegotiation.

666
00:59:28,095 --> 00:59:31,518
Unless you think l'm being unreasonable,
let me explain ourselves.

667
00:59:32,395 --> 00:59:36,612
Nice coffee. We have you under
satellite surveillance, 24 hours a day.

668
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:40,578
We hear everything you say,
we know everything you do.

669
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:43,960
Do you have any idea what it costs
just to change the angle...

670
00:59:44,127 --> 00:59:47,675
...of the lens on a satellite
orbiting 200 miles above the Earth?

671
00:59:47,926 --> 00:59:49,387
And those costs have gone up.

672
00:59:49,512 --> 00:59:52,811
Our costs go up, your costs go up.
lt's only logical.

673
00:59:53,646 --> 00:59:56,109
By the way,
which one of you is Marko?

674
00:59:56,318 --> 00:59:58,113
Why do you want to know?

675
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,741
l was told Marko is in charge.

676
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:01,703
We are all Marko.

677
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:04,334
Marko from Tropoja.

678
01:00:04,501 --> 01:00:05,795
We are all from Tropoja.

679
01:00:08,467 --> 01:00:11,807
lf that's the game you want to play,
the rate just went up 10 percent.

680
01:00:11,974 --> 01:00:16,358
lf you are trying to extort us because
we are immigrants, we know the law.

681
01:00:16,566 --> 01:00:19,155
l'm extorting you because
you are breaking the law.

682
01:00:19,322 --> 01:00:21,869
Which charge would you
like to be arrested for?

683
01:00:22,036 --> 01:00:24,958
Drugs, kidnapping, prostitution?
Take your pick.

684
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:27,756
You come to this country,
take advantage of it...

685
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:31,012
...and think because we are tolerant,
we are weak and helpless.

686
01:00:31,346 --> 01:00:33,141
Your arrogance offends me.

687
01:00:33,308 --> 01:00:35,187
For that,
the rate went up 10 percent.

688
01:00:36,356 --> 01:00:39,446
Now, do you want to get down
to business or to keep playing?

689
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:43,370
-How much?
-Twenty percent.

690
01:00:43,537 --> 01:00:46,251
And you have my word it'll not go up
for a year.

691
01:00:48,188 --> 01:00:49,188
Bring me the can.

692
01:00:55,227 --> 01:00:58,400
How do you say ''sugar''
in your language?

693
01:01:11,718 --> 01:01:13,889
You've made a very good investment,
gentlemen.

694
01:01:14,223 --> 01:01:15,225
See you in a month.

695
01:01:20,194 --> 01:01:23,408
A friend gave this to me.
lt's Albanian. You mind translating it?

696
01:01:35,767 --> 01:01:37,311
Good luck.

697
01:01:37,812 --> 01:01:38,940
<i>-Good luck.
-Good luck.</i>

698
01:01:39,775 --> 01:01:41,570
<i>-Good luck. Good luck.
-Good luck.</i>

699
01:01:51,465 --> 01:01:53,135
You don't remember me.

700
01:01:53,928 --> 01:01:55,932
We spoke on the phone
two days ago.

701
01:01:59,439 --> 01:02:00,900
l told you l would find you.

702
01:03:05,947 --> 01:03:06,949
Kim.

703
01:03:21,353 --> 01:03:22,981
Amanda.

704
01:03:58,886 --> 01:03:59,888
Wake up!

705
01:04:00,514 --> 01:04:02,226
l need you to be focused.

706
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:07,236
Are you focused yet?

707
01:04:17,131 --> 01:04:18,300
Where is this girl?

708
01:04:18,968 --> 01:04:20,596
Where is she?

709
01:04:49,153 --> 01:04:53,078
You know, we used to outsource
this kind of thing.

710
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:55,750
But what we found was the countries
we outsourced to...

711
01:04:55,917 --> 01:04:59,382
...had unreliable power grids.
Very Third World.

712
01:04:59,549 --> 01:05:01,887
You'd turn on a switch,
power wouldn't come on...

713
01:05:02,012 --> 01:05:06,104
...and then tempers would get short.
People would resort to pulling fingernails.

714
01:05:06,271 --> 01:05:08,567
Acid drips on bare skin.

715
01:05:08,734 --> 01:05:11,114
The whole exercise
would become counterproductive.

716
01:05:11,281 --> 01:05:12,909
But here, the power's stable.

717
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:15,498
Here, there's a nice even flow.

718
01:05:15,665 --> 01:05:18,963
Here, you can flip a switch
and the power stays on all day.

719
01:05:23,096 --> 01:05:24,307
Where is she?

720
01:05:45,307 --> 01:05:49,315
Now, l don't have any more time
to waste, Marko from Tropoja.

721
01:05:49,691 --> 01:05:52,071
Give me what l need
or this switch'll stay on...

722
01:05:52,113 --> 01:05:55,202
...till they turn power off
for lack of payment on the bill.

723
01:05:56,371 --> 01:05:57,749
Where is my daughter?

724
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:01,673
We don't keep virgins, we sell them.

725
01:06:01,882 --> 01:06:04,095
She was virgin, lot of money.

726
01:06:04,304 --> 01:06:06,433
You sold my daughter? You sold her?

727
01:06:08,395 --> 01:06:10,065
To who?

728
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:12,361
l don't know.

729
01:06:14,866 --> 01:06:16,787
-What?
-Saint-Clair.

730
01:06:17,163 --> 01:06:18,290
Saint-Clair.

731
01:06:18,791 --> 01:06:21,338
Saint-Clair? Saint-Clair.
ls that a person, a place?

732
01:06:22,882 --> 01:06:25,888
Person. Patrice Saint-Clair.

733
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:27,057
Patrice Saint-Clair.

734
01:06:28,226 --> 01:06:29,521
Where can l find him?

735
01:06:30,648 --> 01:06:32,318
l don't know, l don't know.

736
01:06:33,195 --> 01:06:35,825
l don't know. l don't know.
l don't know.

737
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:38,288
Please! l don't know!

738
01:06:38,413 --> 01:06:42,505
l don't know! No! Please! Please.

739
01:06:42,672 --> 01:06:44,467
Please.

740
01:06:44,634 --> 01:06:46,847
Not that. Please.

741
01:06:46,972 --> 01:06:48,308
l believe you.

742
01:06:51,273 --> 01:06:53,527
But it's not gonna save you.

743
01:07:06,614 --> 01:07:07,736
I'm Home.

744
01:07:09,453 --> 01:07:11,531
- Good evening my dear.
- Good evening, papa.

745
01:07:12,601 --> 01:07:14,676
The children should be in bed.

746
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:18,452
Look who dropped by.

747
01:07:19,329 --> 01:07:21,917
Bryan, what a pleasant surprise.

748
01:07:22,126 --> 01:07:23,128
Jean-Claude.

749
01:07:23,295 --> 01:07:25,758
The children waited up for you.

750
01:07:25,925 --> 01:07:29,349
lf you tuck them in, maybe we can eat
before everything gets cold.

751
01:07:29,516 --> 01:07:30,977
Bryan, will you do the honors?

752
01:07:31,269 --> 01:07:33,023
-Sure.
-l'll be just a minute.

753
01:07:31,742 --> 01:07:33,479
Children, bed time.

754
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,559
- Oh...
- Time to go to sleep, thank you.

755
01:07:41,814 --> 01:07:43,894
Good night.

756
01:08:03,751 --> 01:08:05,755
l was just telling Bryan
how nice it's been...

757
01:08:05,922 --> 01:08:08,051
...since you left the old job
for the new one.

758
01:08:08,385 --> 01:08:11,099
Home every night for dinner,
get to see the kids more.

759
01:08:11,266 --> 01:08:14,355
Yeah, must be nice coming home
every night, seeing your kids.

760
01:08:14,522 --> 01:08:16,652
Bryan has been thinking
about relocating.

761
01:08:17,153 --> 01:08:18,614
-Really?
-Yes.

762
01:08:18,739 --> 01:08:20,576
To Paris, he's been visiting houses.

763
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:23,290
-White or dark meat?
-Dark, please.

764
01:08:23,457 --> 01:08:24,876
Find anything interesting?

765
01:08:25,043 --> 01:08:28,843
As a matter of fact, l did, in the 10th
arrondissement on Rue Paradis.

766
01:08:29,678 --> 01:08:32,141
People there know someone
that works in your office.

767
01:08:32,433 --> 01:08:34,437
A Mr. Macon. Do you know him?

768
01:08:34,604 --> 01:08:36,775
Oh, Henry. l call him Mr. Nervous.

769
01:08:36,942 --> 01:08:40,700
Always seems like he's about to
have a problem. Carrots?

770
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:42,662
l got to the bottom of it,
Jean-Claude.

771
01:08:43,121 --> 01:08:44,165
l know everything.

772
01:08:45,042 --> 01:08:47,255
l hope you're not involved in this shit.

773
01:08:48,465 --> 01:08:51,555
-What shit?
-This is not the time or place, Bryan.

774
01:08:51,722 --> 01:08:53,726
-Are you involved?
-lnvolved in what?

775
01:08:54,352 --> 01:08:55,855
What are you two talking about?

776
01:08:56,022 --> 01:08:59,613
-Are you?
-My salary is X, my expenses are Y.

777
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:01,825
As long as my family is provided for...

778
01:09:01,992 --> 01:09:04,623
...l do not care
where the difference comes from.

779
01:09:04,831 --> 01:09:06,710
That is my entire involvement.

780
01:09:06,877 --> 01:09:08,839
-What about my family?
-l told you...

781
01:09:09,090 --> 01:09:11,470
...l would help
as long as it didn't cause trouble.

782
01:09:11,637 --> 01:09:13,014
Who is Patrice Saint-Clair?

783
01:09:13,181 --> 01:09:16,647
l don't know, l don't care.
l am driving you to the airport.

784
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,536
Quiet, Isabel.
Shut up!

785
01:09:16,814 --> 01:09:18,108
Jean-Claude.

786
01:09:19,486 --> 01:09:21,281
Let's get going. Dinner is over.

787
01:09:21,448 --> 01:09:23,118
-l'm not finished yet.
-Yes, you are.

788
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:26,207
-No!
-No, l'm not.

789
01:09:31,092 --> 01:09:34,307
That's what happens when you sit
behind a desk. You forget things.

790
01:09:34,474 --> 01:09:36,895
Like the weight in the hand
of a gun that's loaded.

791
01:09:36,918 --> 01:09:38,543
Isabelle!
You shot her cold.

792
01:09:39,066 --> 01:09:40,194
lsabelle!

793
01:09:41,530 --> 01:09:42,782
lt's a flesh wound.

794
01:09:42,949 --> 01:09:46,623
But if you don't get me what l need,
the last thing you'll see...

795
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:48,794
...is the bullet
l put between her eyes.

796
01:09:48,961 --> 01:09:52,093
Now, Patrice Saint-Clair.

797
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:05,411
You could've made this
less painful...

798
01:10:05,578 --> 01:10:09,711
...if you had been more concerned about
my daughter and less about your desk.

799
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,216
Please apologize to your wife for me.

800
01:11:17,597 --> 01:11:20,352
-Can l help you?
-Yes, l'm here to see Mr. Saint-Clair.

802
01:11:26,030 --> 01:11:27,993

803
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,788

-Your champagne.
-Yeah, l will take it.

807

Now, Mr...?

Well, we know you're not this man.
So, what do we call you?

844
01:15:28,766 --> 01:15:30,728
lt doesn't matter what we call you...

845
01:15:30,937 --> 01:15:33,400
...what does matter
is what you're doing here.

846
01:15:34,736 --> 01:15:36,698
The last girl, l'm her father.

-Oh, my.
-Give her to me.

851
01:15:50,225 --> 01:15:53,148
...but let me tell you something,
Mr. Whoever-You-Are.

852
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:54,693
This is a business.

...discounts, buybacks.
All sales are final.

857
01:16:04,713 --> 01:16:09,598
Besides discretion,
it's about the only rule we have.

858
01:16:11,476 --> 01:16:13,940
Kill him. Quietly. l have guests.

859

-...they did not understand?
-Yes, sir.

861
01:17:36,688 --> 01:17:40,362
Okay, we can resolve this.
l know how you feel.

862
01:17:40,529 --> 01:17:43,118
We should talk, okay?
We can work this out.

863
01:17:45,539 --> 01:17:47,168
You have no idea--

864
01:17:48,253 --> 01:17:49,547
-Where is she?
-Please.

Please understand.

868
01:18:01,571 --> 01:18:06,122
lt was all business,
it wasn't personal.

869
01:18:06,289 --> 01:18:07,876
lt was all personal to me.

870
01:20:52,016 --> 01:20:53,975
It's ready.

871
01:21:54,941 --> 01:21:57,607
You... take the girls.

872
01:21:57,608 --> 01:22:00,067
You... follow me.

873
01:22:00,108 --> 01:22:02,775
Invaders!  Search the boat.

874
01:22:40,447 --> 01:22:42,031
Where are you?

875
01:22:43,864 --> 01:22:45,448
Why aren't you answering?

876
01:23:11,451 --> 01:23:13,285
Get inside!

877
01:23:13,368 --> 01:23:15,243
What's the problem?

878
01:23:15,327 --> 01:23:17,577
The girls father has arrived.

01:23:17,619 --> 01:23:18,577
Leave it to me.

880
01:25:05,127 --> 01:25:06,087

<i>Attention, travelers.
You are not required to--</i>

Shall we go?

897
01:26:53,302 --> 01:26:55,765
Sure you don't wanna ride with us?

898

-Hi.
-Hi.

902
01:27:44,613 --> 01:27:47,953
When someone says ''hi,''
