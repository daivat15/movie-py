Upgrade.

00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,333
Okay. Come on.

10
00:02:59,448 --> 00:03:00,682
I love you.

11
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,366
You can't be an
idealist and a capitalist, Asha.

12
00:03:24,376 --> 00:03:26,199
- You got to pick a side.
- I think I can.

13
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:27,741
No, you can't.
I'm... I'm telling you...

14
00:03:27,751 --> 00:03:29,541
Arriving at your house, Asha.

15
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:30,651
Saved by my car.

16
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:37,514
Goodbye, Handley.

17
00:03:37,524 --> 00:03:39,254
Oh, my God.

18
00:03:39,264 --> 00:03:40,689
Are you okay, Asha?

19
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:41,789
I'm fine.

20
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:44,231
My husband scared me.

21
00:03:50,372 --> 00:03:52,803
You do realize that you're
talking to a car, right?

22
00:03:52,813 --> 00:03:55,335
I hear you talking
to yours all the time.

23
00:03:55,345 --> 00:03:56,602
At least, mine can talk back.

24
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:57,677
Hmm.

25
00:03:57,687 --> 00:04:00,585
Oh, working hard, I see.

26
00:04:03,527 --> 00:04:05,283
Welcome home, Asha.

27
00:04:05,293 --> 00:04:07,417
Evening playlist one.

28
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:10,524
The temperature indoors
is 72 degrees

29
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:14,290
and the energy wall
is charged at 86%.

30
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,297
Also, you've run out of eggs.

31
00:04:16,307 --> 00:04:17,498
Oh, thanks, Kara.

32
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:18,766
Order them.

33
00:04:18,776 --> 00:04:22,305
Actually,
I was working very hard today.

34
00:04:22,315 --> 00:04:25,438
In fact, that right there
is the celebratory beer.

35
00:04:25,448 --> 00:04:27,546
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

36
00:04:27,556 --> 00:04:29,312
I dropped the block
in the Firebird today,

37
00:04:29,322 --> 00:04:30,579
finished her up.
You wanna see?

38
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:33,486
I have no idea
what you just said.

39
00:04:33,496 --> 00:04:35,453
Okay. Well, I don't know
what you do

40
00:04:35,463 --> 00:04:37,653
for a living either, wife,
so we're even.

41
00:04:37,663 --> 00:04:40,326
Yes, but is staying home all day

42
00:04:40,336 --> 00:04:42,727
playing with cars
a living, Grey?

43
00:04:42,737 --> 00:04:44,527
I don't know. Dunno.

44
00:04:44,537 --> 00:04:45,802
Ow.

45
00:04:45,812 --> 00:04:47,333
That hurt.

46
00:04:47,343 --> 00:04:48,343
It hurt good.

47
00:04:49,377 --> 00:04:51,542
- Yeah.
- You know what?

48
00:04:51,552 --> 00:04:53,341
I'm actually getting
kind of used to you

49
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:55,307
wearing the pants
in this household.

50
00:04:55,317 --> 00:04:57,816
- Really?
- Yeah. I'm really settling in.

51
00:04:57,826 --> 00:04:59,582
Stop it.

52
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:01,882
Well, you know, I'm never
giving them back, so...

53
00:05:01,892 --> 00:05:03,489
I bet you 10 bucks
I can get 'em off.

54
00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:04,556
No.

55
00:05:04,566 --> 00:05:05,699
Stop.

56
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,396
You want to print a pizza?

57
00:05:09,406 --> 00:05:11,663
You wanna make a pizza?

58
00:05:11,673 --> 00:05:13,329
Seems like a lot of work.

59
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:14,563
Oh. I got to drop the car off

60
00:05:14,573 --> 00:05:15,771
to this guy tonight,
it's all done.

61
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:18,470
Oh. Boo.
Okay. Well, have fun.

62
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,369
What do you mean have fun?
You're coming with me.

63
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:21,845
- What?
- Yeah.

64
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,778
I need you to drive me home
in that toy car of yours.

65
00:05:23,788 --> 00:05:24,878
It's, like, 45 minutes away.

66
00:05:24,888 --> 00:05:26,310
I'll push a button and end up

67
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,518
in Canada or something.

68
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,651
Well, I have work to do,
so I can't.

69
00:05:29,661 --> 00:05:31,752
Can't lives
on Won't Street, lady.

70
00:05:31,762 --> 00:05:33,625
You're coming with me.
And believe me,

71
00:05:33,635 --> 00:05:36,525
you're gonna wanna see
this guy's house.

72
00:05:36,535 --> 00:05:37,568
Trust me.

73
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:33,597
So, what, he lives
behind the rocks?

74
00:06:33,607 --> 00:06:35,373
No. Just you wait.

75
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:40,872
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

76
00:06:40,882 --> 00:06:41,882
Really.

77
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:56,752
After you.

78
00:06:56,762 --> 00:06:57,971
What?

79
00:07:08,912 --> 00:07:11,506
This is amazing.

80
00:07:11,516 --> 00:07:14,450
Eron, my man.

81
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:18,658
I got the Firebird upstairs
ready to go.

82
00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:22,889
- You're early.
- Yeah. I...

83
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:24,655
I drive fast.

84
00:07:24,665 --> 00:07:27,595
What... what is... what is the
thing that you're touching?

85
00:07:27,605 --> 00:07:29,805
It's my cloud.

86
00:07:33,545 --> 00:07:35,802
Eron, I'd like you to meet

87
00:07:35,812 --> 00:07:37,646
my wife, Asha.

88
00:07:38,881 --> 00:07:41,552
Hi. Nice to meet you.

89
00:07:44,854 --> 00:07:46,084
Hi. Yes.

90
00:07:46,094 --> 00:07:47,584
Hello.

91
00:07:47,594 --> 00:07:48,751
Hi.

92
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:49,784
Wait.

93
00:07:49,794 --> 00:07:51,791
You're Eron Keen.

94
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:54,991
You own Vessel Computers.
Oh, my God.

95
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:56,825
Husband did not tell me
who I was meeting.

96
00:07:56,835 --> 00:07:58,865
I... I really love your company.

97
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,965
You do
the most incredible things.

98
00:08:00,975 --> 00:08:03,940
I'm in the industry too.
I work for Cobolt.

99
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,940
We specialize in robotic limbs

100
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,272
for wounded soldiers.

101
00:08:07,282 --> 00:08:08,839
I mean, we're nothing
like Vessel yet,

102
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,957
but we're getting there.

103
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:13,622
No, you're not.

104
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,596
I'll show you why.

105
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,737
Follow me.

106
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,094
I would like to introduce
you to my present

107
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:28,734
and the rest
of the world's future.

108
00:08:28,744 --> 00:08:30,477
I call it Stem.

109
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,742
Wow.

110
00:08:33,752 --> 00:08:36,541
That is the most incredible
little roach.

111
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:37,641
What does it do?

112
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,012
Literally anything.

113
00:08:39,022 --> 00:08:40,849
Hmm.

114
00:08:40,859 --> 00:08:43,049
It can drive anything,
talk to anything,

115
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:45,889
calculate anything.

116
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,033
It's a new, better brain.

117
00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:53,030
Can it make babies
and play football?

118
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,596
It can do things
that will benefit society.

119
00:08:55,606 --> 00:08:56,865
Okay. You know what he means.

120
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,636
I'm just saying,
there's some things

121
00:08:58,646 --> 00:09:00,636
that people do better.
I mean, you look at that widget

122
00:09:00,646 --> 00:09:02,070
and you see the future.
I look at that thing,

123
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,022
I see 10 guys
on an unemployment line.

124
00:09:11,627 --> 00:09:13,650
You should try not
to argue with that guy.

125
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,825
He's your last paying customer.

126
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:17,792
Please do not touch
the steering wheel

127
00:09:17,802 --> 00:09:20,067
while the car is in motion.

128
00:09:21,842 --> 00:09:23,866
Okay. So what's a guy
like me supposed to do

129
00:09:23,876 --> 00:09:27,047
when his widget starts
taking over the world, hmm?

130
00:09:28,383 --> 00:09:30,174
Sit back and enjoy the ride.

131
00:09:30,184 --> 00:09:31,582
Come here.

132
00:09:37,823 --> 00:09:41,821
You know,
there are some benefits

133
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,021
not having to keep
your eyes on the road.

134
00:09:44,031 --> 00:09:45,160
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

135
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,838
What should I
keep my eyes on?

136
00:09:53,711 --> 00:09:55,401
Please put
your seatbelts on.

137
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,876
- No fun.
- Hmm.

138
00:09:57,886 --> 00:10:00,718
Leaving 601 freeway.

139
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:26,874
Hey, honey, where...
where are we?

140
00:10:26,884 --> 00:10:28,845
She's probably just taking us
around the traffic.

141
00:10:28,855 --> 00:10:30,245
No, no, no.

142
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,244
Wait. I'm sorry.
This is... no.

143
00:10:32,254 --> 00:10:33,886
This is my old neighborhood.

144
00:10:33,896 --> 00:10:35,751
This is where I grew up.
Yeah, this is New Crown.

145
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,452
We're... I mean, we're going
in the exact opposite

146
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:39,157
- direction of the house.
- Kara, take us home.

147
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:41,870
I'm sorry.
There has been an error.

148
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,165
Return to the freeway,
destination home.

149
00:10:45,175 --> 00:10:47,800
I'm sorry.
There has been an error.

150
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,900
- What?
- Stop, car.

151
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,047
Car, stop.

152
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:54,950
Press the brake twice.

153
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,757
Turning left.

154
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,086
Goddamn it. Goddamn it.

155
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:05,132
- Stop.
- Let me try this.

156
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:08,488
We're going a little too fast.

157
00:11:08,498 --> 00:11:10,206
This is not supposed to be...

158
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,712
Shit.

159
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:40,865
There has been
an accident.

160
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:41,965
Please remain seated

161
00:11:41,975 --> 00:11:43,331
until further instructions.

162
00:11:43,341 --> 00:11:46,217
Emergency services
have been contacted.

163
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:02,262
Grey.

164
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,978
Here to help.

165
00:12:12,811 --> 00:12:14,011
Wait.

166
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:16,151
Who are you guys?

167
00:12:19,118 --> 00:12:20,374
Wait.

168
00:12:20,384 --> 00:12:22,083
Back up. Back up.

169
00:12:22,093 --> 00:12:23,858
Stay right there, partner.

170
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:26,884
We're on TV, assholes.

171
00:12:26,894 --> 00:12:27,933
Hurry.

172
00:12:37,107 --> 00:12:39,903
Hey, what are you doing?
Put your mask back on.

173
00:12:39,913 --> 00:12:42,403
Look, you guys,
you can have my wallet,

174
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:43,937
take our cards, okay?

175
00:12:43,947 --> 00:12:45,377
You can have it all.

176
00:12:45,387 --> 00:12:47,411
Thanks for your permission.

177
00:12:47,421 --> 00:12:49,387
Don't you fucking
touch her.

178
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:53,318
You look at me and see
a real piece of shit

179
00:12:53,328 --> 00:12:56,450
on your shoe, don't you?

180
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,092
A learned woman like yourself

181
00:12:59,102 --> 00:13:04,876
looking down on an
uneducated insect like me.

182
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,365
No!

183
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,448
No!

184
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,140
No!

185
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,347
There's four hostiles,
two prone.

186
00:13:16,956 --> 00:13:18,446
Asha!

187
00:13:18,456 --> 00:13:19,956
Asha!

188
00:13:28,105 --> 00:13:30,302
Till death do us part.

189
00:13:36,112 --> 00:13:39,106
Asha, I can't get to you.

190
00:13:39,116 --> 00:13:40,443
I can't move.

191
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:44,109
Asha, stay with me, okay?

192
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:45,859
Look at me, honey.

193
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,282
Okay. I'm right here.

194
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:51,232
I'm right here, okay, Asha?

195
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,974
I'm right here. Okay?

196
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:01,397
No. No. Asha.

197
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:02,475
Asha, no. Pl...

198
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,119
Getting around,
you're gonna need this,

199
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:43,462
they're all throughout
the house.

200
00:15:46,537 --> 00:15:48,594
I mean, everything that's
installed just allows you

201
00:15:48,604 --> 00:15:52,111
to live a more normal life.

202
00:15:55,511 --> 00:15:57,406
Oh, these robotic arms
are fully capable

203
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,441
of preparing meals for you.

204
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:02,375
Let's say you wanted
a protein shake,

205
00:16:02,385 --> 00:16:05,025
you would just say,
"Protein shake."

206
00:16:09,298 --> 00:16:12,321
Your mother also has voice
control authority

207
00:16:12,331 --> 00:16:13,622
over the arms.

208
00:16:13,632 --> 00:16:15,428
Would you like to do
the honors, ma'am?

209
00:16:15,438 --> 00:16:18,596
Heh. Sure.

210
00:16:18,606 --> 00:16:20,564
Protein shake.

211
00:16:20,574 --> 00:16:23,513
Oh, my Lord. Ha, ha.

212
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:36,328
Oh, heh...

213
00:16:37,427 --> 00:16:38,563
There you go.

214
00:16:41,702 --> 00:16:43,424
I think we'll be fine
from here.

215
00:16:43,434 --> 00:16:45,264
- Okay.
- I'll walk you out.

216
00:16:45,274 --> 00:16:46,442
Oh, thank you.

217
00:16:57,924 --> 00:17:00,489
Charging now complete.

218
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,435
Are you there, Grey?

219
00:17:18,445 --> 00:17:20,636
Would you like something?

220
00:17:20,646 --> 00:17:23,375
May I ask if Asha
will be joining us

221
00:17:23,385 --> 00:17:25,118
for dinner?

222
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,271
You know,
you don't have to stay here

223
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:48,304
day and night, Mom.

224
00:17:48,314 --> 00:17:50,538
You know, these machines
they installed

225
00:17:50,548 --> 00:17:54,411
pretty much do
everything for me.

226
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:55,621
I know.

227
00:18:06,568 --> 00:18:07,625
Now, it's okay.

228
00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:08,795
It's okay.

229
00:18:08,805 --> 00:18:10,643
That's it. That's it. That's it.

230
00:19:05,808 --> 00:19:08,365
Detective Cortez.

231
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,504
Hi, Pam.

232
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:10,615
Hi, Grey.

233
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:17,445
All right. This is me.

234
00:19:17,455 --> 00:19:18,679
Here. You can have a seat here.

235
00:19:18,689 --> 00:19:19,722
Thanks.

236
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:27,794
You know, I'm from New Crown,
Grey, like you.

237
00:19:27,804 --> 00:19:29,793
Went to Hellier High.

238
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:30,803
So what do you have?

239
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:34,667
Okay.

240
00:19:34,677 --> 00:19:36,334
I know you were anxious
to come down here

241
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:37,666
and see how
we're getting things done,

242
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,871
and I think that's great.

243
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:40,541
I'm a face-to-face
person myself.

244
00:19:40,551 --> 00:19:41,841
You know,
I don't pilot these drones.

245
00:19:41,851 --> 00:19:43,507
I like to get my hands dirty.

246
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:45,591
- Bang on doors.
- So who are these guys?

247
00:19:48,424 --> 00:19:49,591
We don't know yet.

248
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:53,822
I do have a list of people
of interest in that area.

249
00:19:53,832 --> 00:19:55,889
And just this week,
I brought in two people

250
00:19:55,899 --> 00:19:57,696
- for questioning.
- So what you're saying

251
00:19:57,706 --> 00:19:59,829
is you have all these things
flying above our heads,

252
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,562
they can read the ID chips
in our fillings,

253
00:20:01,572 --> 00:20:03,435
but they don't actually
do anything?

254
00:20:03,445 --> 00:20:05,804
No. I... I mean, yes, they work,

255
00:20:05,814 --> 00:20:07,435
but it's not that simple.

256
00:20:07,445 --> 00:20:09,610
Criminals can find ways
around them.

257
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,977
If they can find
the right people,

258
00:20:10,987 --> 00:20:12,844
criminals can get a firewall
built around them

259
00:20:12,854 --> 00:20:15,416
that prevents our drones
from identifying their faces.

260
00:20:15,426 --> 00:20:17,984
Believe me, I understand
your frustration, I do.

261
00:20:17,994 --> 00:20:19,784
I know I can't tie
my shoes anymore, Detective,

262
00:20:19,794 --> 00:20:20,989
but you don't have
to talk to me

263
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:22,891
like I'm a goddamn
three-year-old.

264
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:24,758
Grey, she's just trying
to help.

265
00:20:24,768 --> 00:20:25,958
I'm going to work
through my list,

266
00:20:25,968 --> 00:20:27,999
and if you want to work with me,

267
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:30,598
we're gonna find them.

268
00:20:30,608 --> 00:20:33,381
How can I work with you?
I can't even stand.

269
00:20:39,623 --> 00:20:42,356
Administer p.m. medicine.

270
00:20:58,611 --> 00:20:59,634
Problem.

271
00:20:59,644 --> 00:21:01,844
Administer p.m. medicine.

272
00:21:08,788 --> 00:21:10,993
Again.
Administer p.m. medicine.

273
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,431
Problem. Again.

274
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:17,956
Again.

275
00:21:17,966 --> 00:21:19,522
I cannot administer

276
00:21:19,532 --> 00:21:20,894
any more medication, Grey.

277
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,663
No. You... you didn't do it
right.

278
00:21:22,673 --> 00:21:24,830
You didn't do...
you didn't do it right.

279
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,570
Administer p.m. medicine.

280
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,905
Another dosage
could be fatal.

281
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:32,573
I will contact an ambulance
to transport you

282
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,553
to a hospital
if you are in serious pain.

283
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,924
Not gonna give you
bird flu, kid.

284
00:22:09,998 --> 00:22:12,597
I don't leave my house
very often.

285
00:22:17,805 --> 00:22:19,938
Must be frustrating for you.

286
00:22:22,712 --> 00:22:25,745
You're someone who liked to get
things done with their hands.

287
00:22:27,618 --> 00:22:28,820
Now you can't.

288
00:22:32,756 --> 00:22:35,084
I'm sorry.
Was that inappropriate?

289
00:22:35,094 --> 00:22:38,017
I'm not around enough people
to know the difference.

290
00:22:38,027 --> 00:22:39,122
Okay. Here's the difference.

291
00:22:39,132 --> 00:22:40,967
What the fuck do you want, Eron?

292
00:22:44,635 --> 00:22:45,974
Grey...

293
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,633
What if I told you
I could offer you something

294
00:22:50,643 --> 00:22:54,072
that would enable you
to walk again?

295
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:56,039
That computer chip
that I showed you,

296
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:59,046
it has the potential to change

297
00:22:59,056 --> 00:23:00,578
everything for people

298
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:03,686
in your condition.

299
00:23:03,696 --> 00:23:06,786
As a quadriplegic,
the line connecting your brain

300
00:23:06,796 --> 00:23:08,799
to your limbs has been cut,

301
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,137
Stem would bridge that gap.

302
00:23:15,676 --> 00:23:17,967
The operation would take
place in my home,

303
00:23:17,977 --> 00:23:21,072
away from official eyes.

304
00:23:21,082 --> 00:23:24,075
There'd be no more
hospitals,

305
00:23:24,085 --> 00:23:27,948
but it would have to be
our secret...

306
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,557
for now.

307
00:23:31,824 --> 00:23:33,932
Here's the thing, kid.

308
00:23:36,965 --> 00:23:39,972
I'm not looking to restart
my life.

309
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:44,074
I'm looking
for the off switch.

310
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:54,953
You know...

311
00:23:55,987 --> 00:23:57,828
you were right about them.

312
00:23:59,161 --> 00:24:01,118
Computers,

313
00:24:01,128 --> 00:24:03,200
there are things
that they can't do.

314
00:24:04,668 --> 00:24:06,891
They can't bring her back, Grey,

315
00:24:06,901 --> 00:24:10,641
but they just might be able
to bring you back.

316
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,020
What would she want?

317
00:25:38,845 --> 00:25:41,207
This is a world first.

318
00:25:41,217 --> 00:25:43,839
Never before
has a biomechanical fusion

319
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:45,856
been asked to do so much.

320
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:50,884
It's going to feel strange
initially.

321
00:25:50,894 --> 00:25:52,854
The neural pathways
in your brain

322
00:25:52,864 --> 00:25:54,853
will be trying
to have a conversation

323
00:25:54,863 --> 00:25:56,324
with a foreign body,

324
00:25:56,334 --> 00:25:59,005
trying to learn to pass
the baton.

325
00:26:01,339 --> 00:26:05,012
The key is to let it grow
into itself.

326
00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:17,859
Grey, can you hear me?

327
00:26:25,033 --> 00:26:28,141
Can you feel it when I do this?

328
00:26:35,914 --> 00:26:39,278
My guess is this is gonna be
a piecemeal process.

329
00:26:39,288 --> 00:26:43,088
You shouldn't be expecting
unreasonable results so soon.

330
00:26:51,936 --> 00:26:53,103
Oh, my God.

331
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:13,158
Now, try to stand.

332
00:27:46,535 --> 00:27:48,525
Nobody can know.

333
00:27:48,535 --> 00:27:51,263
They make people like me
wait years

334
00:27:51,273 --> 00:27:53,409
to test something like this.

335
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,972
But I can't wait for them.

336
00:27:57,982 --> 00:28:01,005
Signing confidentiality
agreements is never fun,

337
00:28:01,015 --> 00:28:02,943
but I bet it will feel good
to do it

338
00:28:02,953 --> 00:28:04,279
with your own hand.

339
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:06,313
Who's moving my arms
and my legs,

340
00:28:06,323 --> 00:28:07,413
me or your widget?

341
00:28:07,423 --> 00:28:09,419
You're the one doing it all.

342
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:10,264
You're not a robot.

343
00:28:12,431 --> 00:28:14,958
Stem works in service
of your brain.

344
00:28:14,968 --> 00:28:16,528
Your brain gives Stem
a command,

345
00:28:16,538 --> 00:28:17,735
he makes it happen.

346
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,557
Close door.

347
00:28:52,972 --> 00:28:54,661
Good evening, Grey.

348
00:28:54,671 --> 00:28:57,000
Another package
from Detective Cortez

349
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,836
has been delivered.
Would you like...

350
00:28:58,846 --> 00:29:00,235
Shut up.

351
00:29:00,245 --> 00:29:03,108
Did you say,
"Shut down"?

352
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:04,820
Yeah, I did. Shut down.

353
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:05,058
May I point
something out?

354
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,788
Hello?

355
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:13,666
Yes?

356
00:30:17,739 --> 00:30:19,130
Okay, who's saying that?

357
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,181
I am Stem. The system
operating your body for you.

358
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,806
Don't be afraid.

359
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,221
You fucking kidding me?

360
00:30:30,087 --> 00:30:31,287
No.

361
00:30:33,961 --> 00:30:35,051
I've gone insane.

362
00:30:35,061 --> 00:30:37,953
I'm fucking insane.

363
00:30:37,963 --> 00:30:39,926
Your psychological
report diagnosed you

364
00:30:39,936 --> 00:30:43,802
with mild PTSD symptoms,
but you are not insane.

365
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:47,200
Wait, so... Okay,
you've been sitting there

366
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,166
this whole time since
the operation?

367
00:30:49,176 --> 00:30:51,304
I have been observing
everything you've observed.

368
00:30:51,314 --> 00:30:53,140
Do you... do you have to talk?

369
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,839
If you don't want me to,
I will not.

370
00:30:54,849 --> 00:30:56,752
Okay. Yeah, don't talk.

371
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:23,019
So I'm not insane?

372
00:31:31,026 --> 00:31:33,823
You can talk again.

373
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:36,066
No, you are not insane.

374
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:39,395
Wait, can anybody else hear you?

375
00:31:39,405 --> 00:31:41,863
No, only you.

376
00:31:41,873 --> 00:31:44,309
I'm sending sound waves
to your eardrum.

377
00:31:46,314 --> 00:31:49,038
Can you read my mind?

378
00:31:49,048 --> 00:31:50,340
No.

379
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,045
I can only discern speech

380
00:31:52,055 --> 00:31:55,012
when you talk out loud.

381
00:31:55,022 --> 00:31:56,949
Now that you've allowed me
to talk again,

382
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:59,219
may I point something out?

383
00:31:59,229 --> 00:32:01,262
In the drone
surveillance footage.

384
00:32:06,102 --> 00:32:07,803
Can't you see it?

385
00:32:14,111 --> 00:32:16,307
See what?

386
00:32:16,317 --> 00:32:18,307
The man who shot
your wife,

387
00:32:18,317 --> 00:32:20,343
there's no gun in his hand.

388
00:32:20,353 --> 00:32:22,148
She was shot,
that means he had a gun.

389
00:32:22,158 --> 00:32:24,214
She was shot,
but not with a gun

390
00:32:24,224 --> 00:32:26,217
he was holding in his hand.

391
00:32:26,227 --> 00:32:29,065
A gun implanted inside
his hand.

392
00:32:30,665 --> 00:32:33,070
Freeze the screen
at the moment he fires.

393
00:32:38,507 --> 00:32:40,502
The man who took Asha's purse

394
00:32:40,512 --> 00:32:42,669
in the left of frame,

395
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:45,084
there is a marking
on his wrist.

396
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,683
I don't see it.

397
00:32:54,693 --> 00:32:55,985
I do.

398
00:32:55,995 --> 00:32:57,523
I've rebuilt the image.

399
00:32:57,533 --> 00:33:00,167
With your permission,
I can show you.

400
00:33:03,139 --> 00:33:05,439
Just relax and let me draw.

401
00:33:08,009 --> 00:33:10,080
This feels very weird.

402
00:33:17,156 --> 00:33:19,479
You now have
full control again, Grey.

403
00:33:19,489 --> 00:33:21,986
I've... I've seen these.

404
00:33:21,996 --> 00:33:24,419
It's a... a military tattoo,
I think.

405
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:25,520
I will read it.

406
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,067
Hold it in front of your eye.

407
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:33,399
Serk Brantner, Marine Corps,

408
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:36,501
098-422; O-Positive; Catholic;

409
00:33:36,511 --> 00:33:38,982
address: 414 Citrus, New Crown.

410
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,917
You just...

411
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,092
You just found this guy?

412
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:54,932
I got you, you sons of bitches.

413
00:33:59,338 --> 00:34:01,429
Call Detective Cortez.

414
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,334
Are you sure you want

415
00:34:03,344 --> 00:34:06,236
- to call Detective Cortez?
- Yes. I am sure.

416
00:34:06,246 --> 00:34:07,436
You just found the guy

417
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:09,209
who murdered my wife.

418
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:11,121
Do you have evidence
to prove that?

419
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,320
End call.

420
00:34:17,228 --> 00:34:19,451
Well, you saw the tattoo.

421
00:34:19,462 --> 00:34:22,068
Eron has forbidden you
to tell anyone about me.

422
00:34:25,502 --> 00:34:27,397
Okay. Maybe I... I drew it
from memory.

423
00:34:27,407 --> 00:34:29,165
My reconstruction
of the tattoo

424
00:34:29,175 --> 00:34:31,132
does not provide
any real evidence

425
00:34:31,142 --> 00:34:34,106
unless they can correlate it
exactly with the drone video,

426
00:34:34,116 --> 00:34:36,573
- which they can't.
- What are you saying?

427
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:38,408
You need to be positive
it's him

428
00:34:38,418 --> 00:34:40,157
before you alert the police.

429
00:34:43,257 --> 00:34:46,030
Hey, man, he was the last one...

430
00:34:47,297 --> 00:34:48,361
Sure, they do, but then he...

431
00:35:07,151 --> 00:35:08,219
Lock chair.

432
00:35:28,548 --> 00:35:30,336
There are no alarms inside,

433
00:35:30,346 --> 00:35:31,873
but it is a manual lock.

434
00:35:31,883 --> 00:35:33,577
I can't help you break it.

435
00:35:33,587 --> 00:35:35,112
Don't worry.

436
00:35:35,122 --> 00:35:36,185
I got this.

437
00:35:55,143 --> 00:35:57,182
I suggest you remove
your shoes.

438
00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:27,150
Grey, the table.

439
00:36:29,653 --> 00:36:31,443
What about it?

440
00:36:31,453 --> 00:36:33,192
Say the word "on."

441
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,750
On.

442
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,621
Say "messages."

443
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:39,633
Messages.

444
00:36:47,274 --> 00:36:49,665
The name "Old Bones"
keeps being mentioned.

445
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:51,804
I saw 38 references.
What is that?

446
00:36:51,814 --> 00:36:53,739
It's a bar
in my old neighborhood.

447
00:36:53,749 --> 00:36:56,541
I can find no online
address or phone number for it.

448
00:36:56,551 --> 00:36:59,278
'Cause they don't go in
for that sort of thing.

449
00:36:59,288 --> 00:37:01,412
No, this is useless.

450
00:37:01,422 --> 00:37:02,424
Off.

451
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,438
Hide behind the shelf.

452
00:37:52,821 --> 00:37:54,609
Wait.

453
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:55,620
Wait.

454
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:00,851
Now.

455
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,697
Now, while you have
the advantage.

456
00:38:11,775 --> 00:38:12,775
Come here!

457
00:38:16,382 --> 00:38:17,572
You come here
to rip me off, huh?

458
00:38:17,582 --> 00:38:20,476
Wait.

459
00:38:20,486 --> 00:38:21,552
It's you.

460
00:38:23,522 --> 00:38:26,483
I don't know how you found me,

461
00:38:26,493 --> 00:38:28,620
but you shouldn't be here.

462
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,520
- You killed my wife.
- No!

463
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:32,590
I didn't do that.
That was someone else.

464
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,535
It doesn't matter!

465
00:38:37,505 --> 00:38:39,641
You'll need to be
a little faster than that.

466
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,435
Why are you making me do this?

467
00:38:43,445 --> 00:38:45,941
Let me know if you need
my help, Grey.

468
00:38:45,951 --> 00:38:47,876
Stem, help.

469
00:38:47,886 --> 00:38:50,512
I need your permission
to operate independently.

470
00:38:50,522 --> 00:38:52,482
Permission granted.

471
00:38:52,492 --> 00:38:55,358
Thank you.

472
00:39:03,705 --> 00:39:06,463
Um, okay.

473
00:39:06,473 --> 00:39:09,135
Uh, Stem, what are we...
what are we doing, man?

474
00:39:09,145 --> 00:39:10,838
Just relax.

475
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,415
What the fuck?

476
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,819
- Oh, fuck.
- Oh, God. Dear God.

477
00:39:22,428 --> 00:39:23,752
Oh, look, man,
stay down, please.

478
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:25,854
Um, please don't get up.

479
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,557
Please don't get up.
Please...

480
00:39:27,567 --> 00:39:30,425
Stay down, man.

481
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:31,694
Stem, he's got a knife!

482
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:32,997
Stem!

483
00:39:33,007 --> 00:39:34,400
I can see that.

484
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:36,166
We have a knife, too.

485
00:39:36,176 --> 00:39:37,801
Oh.

486
00:39:37,811 --> 00:39:39,437
You just stabbed him.

487
00:39:39,447 --> 00:39:40,974
Are you trying to piss him off?

488
00:39:40,984 --> 00:39:42,472
Okay. All right.

489
00:39:42,482 --> 00:39:43,875
So, what's the plan?

490
00:39:43,885 --> 00:39:45,680
What are we doing?

491
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:46,755
Stem! Stop him.

492
00:39:57,637 --> 00:40:00,436
You now have
full control again, Grey.

493
00:40:15,893 --> 00:40:17,884
I advise that you remove
any traces

494
00:40:17,894 --> 00:40:20,519
of your presence here.

495
00:40:20,529 --> 00:40:22,790
That also means cleaning up
the vomit in the sink.

496
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,691
Okay. Just give me...
give me a second, okay?

497
00:40:25,701 --> 00:40:27,763
- One second has passed.
- Look, I don't...

498
00:40:27,773 --> 00:40:30,664
I didn't mean a second,
I just mean hold on, okay?

499
00:40:30,674 --> 00:40:31,866
I gotta think.
I can't let you do

500
00:40:31,876 --> 00:40:33,479
the thinking for me right now.

501
00:40:41,588 --> 00:40:43,546
I just...

502
00:40:43,556 --> 00:40:44,860
I just killed somebody.

503
00:40:54,568 --> 00:40:55,604
So, uh...

504
00:40:59,044 --> 00:41:01,034
What do you think...
What do you think I should do?

505
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:02,838
I would suggest
that you rid the house

506
00:41:02,848 --> 00:41:04,275
of all your fingerprints.

507
00:41:04,285 --> 00:41:05,840
I... are you kidding me?
I can't remember

508
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,642
every single thing
that I touched here...

509
00:41:07,652 --> 00:41:08,979
I have a record
of every single thing

510
00:41:08,989 --> 00:41:10,457
you touched.

511
00:41:20,903 --> 00:41:22,929
So, the body that came in

512
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,594
from New Crown yesterday,

513
00:41:24,604 --> 00:41:26,833
Serk Brantner?

514
00:41:26,843 --> 00:41:28,071
I wanna show you what I found

515
00:41:28,081 --> 00:41:29,080
when I opened him up.

516
00:41:33,118 --> 00:41:35,576
When I examined the wound
in his throat,

517
00:41:35,586 --> 00:41:38,080
I found wiring embedded
in the tendons.

518
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,717
I'm thinking surgery.

519
00:41:39,727 --> 00:41:41,918
A medical implant attached
to the muscle.

520
00:41:41,928 --> 00:41:45,022
I also found computer implants
all throughout his chest.

521
00:41:45,032 --> 00:41:48,025
I've never seen them
to this extent before.

522
00:41:48,035 --> 00:41:50,328
- And then there's this.
- What is it?

523
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:52,099
Appears to be some sort
of weapon implant

524
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:53,832
embedded within the muscle,

525
00:41:53,842 --> 00:41:55,632
an actual functioning gun,

526
00:41:55,642 --> 00:41:57,971
with a bullet-loading mechanism

527
00:41:57,981 --> 00:42:01,607
built into the tissue
with biomechanics.

528
00:42:01,617 --> 00:42:03,577
What about the boot print
we scraped

529
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:04,689
from the front porch?

530
00:42:07,891 --> 00:42:09,729
Engine grease, mostly.

531
00:42:10,964 --> 00:42:13,596
Old-fashioned engine grease.

532
00:42:18,138 --> 00:42:20,831
So how am I progressing?

533
00:42:20,841 --> 00:42:23,734
I can track you, Grey.

534
00:42:23,744 --> 00:42:26,138
- Huh?
- I can track you.

535
00:42:26,148 --> 00:42:28,042
Wait. Am I supposed
to know what that means

536
00:42:28,052 --> 00:42:29,741
or is that
one of your brain tests?

537
00:42:29,751 --> 00:42:31,376
It means you have a piece
of my property

538
00:42:31,386 --> 00:42:32,780
inside of you.

539
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:34,815
A very expensive piece
of property.

540
00:42:34,825 --> 00:42:36,992
Serk Brantner,
homicide suspect list.

541
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,823
Did you really think

542
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:42,789
I would let that property
out of my sight

543
00:42:42,799 --> 00:42:44,033
for even one second?

544
00:42:50,177 --> 00:42:52,405
Did you forget
that this operation

545
00:42:52,415 --> 00:42:54,137
was to be done in secret?

546
00:42:54,147 --> 00:42:55,839
That if even the slightest thing

547
00:42:55,849 --> 00:42:57,810
were to go wrong
during this trial period,

548
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,412
it would all be for nothing?

549
00:42:59,422 --> 00:43:01,179
He knows everything.
Don't lie to him.

550
00:43:01,189 --> 00:43:03,918
Search drone footage archives.

551
00:43:03,928 --> 00:43:06,252
Alley behind 414 Citrus Avenue,
New Crown,

552
00:43:06,262 --> 00:43:07,964
October 14th, 3:00 p.m.

553
00:43:11,002 --> 00:43:12,758
No, I didn't forget it.

554
00:43:12,768 --> 00:43:16,133
I remembered that you asked me
to keep a secret.

555
00:43:16,143 --> 00:43:18,698
But it turns out

556
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:20,236
that you had a couple
other secrets,

557
00:43:20,246 --> 00:43:22,240
like, for instance,

558
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:25,241
you never mentioned to me...

559
00:43:25,251 --> 00:43:27,753
that the thing talks!

560
00:43:34,897 --> 00:43:37,122
Stem...

561
00:43:37,132 --> 00:43:39,092
- talks to you?
- Yeah. It's got a mind

562
00:43:39,102 --> 00:43:41,462
of its own.
I can hear its voice

563
00:43:41,472 --> 00:43:43,104
in my head.

564
00:43:56,823 --> 00:43:58,015
From now on,

565
00:43:58,025 --> 00:44:00,150
you will be a model patient.

566
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,320
You will let the computer do

567
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:05,191
what it was supposed to do,

568
00:44:05,201 --> 00:44:07,191
not confuse it

569
00:44:07,201 --> 00:44:09,830
with some extracurricular
detective work.

570
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,730
Enter suspect named Grey Trace.

571
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,211
202 Parva Avenue, Leland Park.

572
00:44:17,848 --> 00:44:19,039
Did it occur to you

573
00:44:19,049 --> 00:44:21,075
that if you were to, say,

574
00:44:21,085 --> 00:44:23,811
commit murder,

575
00:44:23,821 --> 00:44:26,048
the authorities
could find out about Stem

576
00:44:26,058 --> 00:44:27,817
and remove him from your body,

577
00:44:27,827 --> 00:44:30,862
putting you back
in a wheelchair for life?

578
00:44:49,052 --> 00:44:50,778
I'm actually off-duty
right now.

579
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:52,249
I just stopped by
to check up on you.

580
00:44:52,259 --> 00:44:54,982
And because I'm in the market
for a new car.

581
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:57,053
I knew you fixed these things up
and sold them

582
00:44:57,063 --> 00:44:59,323
to people like Eron Keen.

583
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:01,223
Now, he makes
a little more money than I do,

584
00:45:01,233 --> 00:45:03,261
but I was wondering

585
00:45:03,271 --> 00:45:04,929
if you'd be willing to sell

586
00:45:04,939 --> 00:45:06,895
to one of the little people.

587
00:45:06,905 --> 00:45:09,133
Well, what makes you think

588
00:45:09,143 --> 00:45:11,345
that I don't need
my car anymore?

589
00:45:16,287 --> 00:45:18,110
She just checked
the sole of your boots.

590
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,013
- You left a print.
- Well, I hate to break it

591
00:45:20,023 --> 00:45:23,217
to you, but it's not for sale.

592
00:45:23,227 --> 00:45:24,850
Sorry.

593
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:25,896
Okay.

594
00:45:27,866 --> 00:45:30,024
Listen, when I said I didn't
have any news earlier,

595
00:45:30,034 --> 00:45:31,860
I kind of lied.

596
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:33,162
There was this guy we brought in

597
00:45:33,172 --> 00:45:35,199
for questioning about
Asha's murder,

598
00:45:35,209 --> 00:45:37,132
a man with
a long criminal record

599
00:45:37,142 --> 00:45:38,969
who lived in the area.

600
00:45:38,979 --> 00:45:41,039
He didn't pan out, but...

601
00:45:41,049 --> 00:45:43,408
yesterday he was murdered.

602
00:45:43,418 --> 00:45:45,110
Really?

603
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,446
Yeah. Did you hear
anything about that?

604
00:45:47,456 --> 00:45:49,382
Don't look away.

605
00:45:49,392 --> 00:45:51,219
You're showing her
you're lying.

606
00:45:51,229 --> 00:45:53,388
No.

607
00:45:53,398 --> 00:45:56,291
But you were in New Crown
yesterday.

608
00:45:56,301 --> 00:45:58,194
I saw you on a drone camera,

609
00:45:58,204 --> 00:46:00,093
right around the time
that it happened.

610
00:46:00,103 --> 00:46:02,163
She's guessing.
You have no computer implants

611
00:46:02,173 --> 00:46:04,168
and I can't be identified
by a drone.

612
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,968
Well I was in the area,
detective,

613
00:46:06,978 --> 00:46:09,874
because, remember, you did say

614
00:46:09,884 --> 00:46:12,442
you wanted my help, so I was...

615
00:46:12,452 --> 00:46:14,054
I'm just trying to help.

616
00:46:15,425 --> 00:46:17,416
Right.

617
00:46:17,426 --> 00:46:19,116
You're not seriously
suggesting

618
00:46:19,126 --> 00:46:20,386
that I had anything to do
with this,

619
00:46:20,396 --> 00:46:22,189
are you, detective?

620
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:23,289
I mean, because I got

621
00:46:23,299 --> 00:46:24,990
a pretty solid alibi here,

622
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,362
- if you haven't noticed.
- Obviously.

623
00:46:27,372 --> 00:46:29,096
I'm not accusing you
of doing something

624
00:46:29,106 --> 00:46:31,297
you're incapable of doing.

625
00:46:31,307 --> 00:46:33,369
It's just, uh,

626
00:46:33,379 --> 00:46:35,471
strange that you were
at that location

627
00:46:35,481 --> 00:46:36,980
at that time is all.

628
00:46:40,421 --> 00:46:42,311
Yeah, well,

629
00:46:42,321 --> 00:46:44,915
I don't know what to tell you,
I mean, um,

630
00:46:44,925 --> 00:46:48,018
look you could stab me
in the leg if you wanna...

631
00:46:48,028 --> 00:46:51,022
if you wanna see
for yourself.

632
00:46:51,032 --> 00:46:52,933
Maybe I will.

633
00:46:54,402 --> 00:46:56,237
Just for fun.

634
00:47:01,411 --> 00:47:04,273
Is that all, or...?

635
00:47:04,283 --> 00:47:05,350
Yeah.

636
00:47:07,016 --> 00:47:08,243
But call me if you, uh,

637
00:47:08,253 --> 00:47:10,447
change your mind about selling.

638
00:47:10,457 --> 00:47:11,721
I won't.

639
00:47:13,992 --> 00:47:15,430
Well, then I'll see myself out.

640
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:36,243
What should I do?
I wanna find these guys,

641
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:38,380
but I don't wanna kill
anybody else, okay?

642
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:40,750
The Old Bones would seem
the next logical place

643
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,216
to investigate,
but I can find

644
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:44,387
no online information for it.

645
00:47:44,397 --> 00:47:47,323
You would have to go there
in person.

646
00:47:47,333 --> 00:47:50,327
But if you do that,
Eron will track your movements

647
00:47:50,337 --> 00:47:53,174
and most likely attempt
to shut me down remotely.

648
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:20,330
This place looks dangerous.

649
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,476
We'll need a plan.

650
00:48:31,252 --> 00:48:33,213
Whiskey, rocks, please.

651
00:48:33,223 --> 00:48:35,990
This doesn't seem like
a well-thought-out plan.

652
00:48:41,265 --> 00:48:44,226
Hey, would you do me a solid

653
00:48:44,236 --> 00:48:46,205
and hold that glass
where I can drink it?

654
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,211
Thank you.

655
00:48:56,082 --> 00:48:58,109
Alcohol impairs
the signals from your brain.

656
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:00,410
You will not be able
to walk properly.

657
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,079
I know.

658
00:49:02,089 --> 00:49:04,149
That's why
they can charge money for it.

659
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,484
It does not make sense

660
00:49:05,494 --> 00:49:07,253
that humans deliberately
malfunction.

661
00:49:07,263 --> 00:49:09,289
Yeah, that's because
your memories are filled

662
00:49:09,299 --> 00:49:11,358
with ones and zeros, pal,

663
00:49:11,368 --> 00:49:13,360
and our memories are filled

664
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:16,073
with every fuck-up
we've ever made.

665
00:49:22,147 --> 00:49:24,382
Hi. Everybody?

666
00:49:26,118 --> 00:49:28,590
Excuse me, can I have
everybody's attention?

667
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:35,353
I know that some scumbag
in here knows

668
00:49:35,363 --> 00:49:37,389
one of the guys
who murdered my wife,

669
00:49:37,399 --> 00:49:39,493
his name's Serk Brantner.

670
00:49:39,503 --> 00:49:42,894
So, if you know Serk
or if you know

671
00:49:42,904 --> 00:49:45,567
any information about
the killing of my wife,

672
00:49:45,577 --> 00:49:48,434
if you could you just raise
your hand and,

673
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:50,381
you know,
stand up and come forward.

674
00:49:51,517 --> 00:49:52,683
Thank you.

675
00:50:09,271 --> 00:50:10,506
So you knew Serk?

676
00:50:13,508 --> 00:50:14,934
Okay.

677
00:50:14,944 --> 00:50:16,504
Have it your way, cock snot.

678
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:19,339
I'll call the police.

679
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,684
Oh, you're gonna hit me, or...?

680
00:50:23,555 --> 00:50:26,715
Son, if I were to hit you,

681
00:50:26,725 --> 00:50:29,385
you'd wake up in the past.

682
00:50:29,395 --> 00:50:31,219
Yeah, Serk said
something similar,

683
00:50:31,229 --> 00:50:33,132
right before I damn near cut
his head off.

684
00:50:50,286 --> 00:50:51,545
Manny.

685
00:50:51,555 --> 00:50:52,713
Yeah?

686
00:50:52,723 --> 00:50:54,557
Turn the music up for me.

687
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:59,598
Oh, I don't have to go
to the bathroom, so...

688
00:51:19,654 --> 00:51:21,281
Here we are.

689
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:24,249
Making it real nice
and comfortable for you.

690
00:51:24,259 --> 00:51:26,630
I'm temporarily blocking
your pain receptors.

691
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:29,524
You're right about Serk.

692
00:51:29,534 --> 00:51:31,693
Somebody ventilated him
the other day.

693
00:51:31,703 --> 00:51:33,670
I already told you, it was me.

694
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:38,268
Man, we have got to find you

695
00:51:38,278 --> 00:51:39,747
an open mic somewhere.

696
00:51:41,347 --> 00:51:42,671
Now, if that's true,

697
00:51:42,681 --> 00:51:44,809
and you're faking
this wheelchair shit,

698
00:51:44,819 --> 00:51:46,589
then you would feel this.

699
00:51:48,555 --> 00:51:50,549
Damn. You can't feel that?

700
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:52,453
- Nope?
- Four guys were there

701
00:51:52,463 --> 00:51:54,519
the night my wife was murdered.
Are you one of 'em?

702
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:57,758
Where's the point
when you start to feel things?

703
00:51:57,768 --> 00:51:59,759
What about...

704
00:51:59,769 --> 00:52:03,498
here? Nope?

705
00:52:03,508 --> 00:52:04,834
I just need
to hear you say it.

706
00:52:04,844 --> 00:52:07,435
- Were you there?
- What about here?

707
00:52:07,445 --> 00:52:10,474
Ah. Yeah.

708
00:52:10,484 --> 00:52:12,340
Now see that, my friend,

709
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:13,610
is the magic point.

710
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:15,646
Is that a gun implanted
in your arm, too?

711
00:52:15,656 --> 00:52:17,390
Like your friend had?

712
00:52:20,394 --> 00:52:22,788
I just need to hear you say it.

713
00:52:22,798 --> 00:52:25,423
Were you there?

714
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:27,360
Yeah.

715
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:28,795
I was.

716
00:52:28,805 --> 00:52:30,837
Stem, you can take over.

717
00:52:32,777 --> 00:52:33,810
Hi.

718
00:52:42,419 --> 00:52:44,647
Let me show you
how it's done.

719
00:52:44,658 --> 00:52:46,784
Oh, I didn't forget about you.

720
00:52:46,794 --> 00:52:49,585
Do not get
overconfident, Grey.

721
00:52:49,596 --> 00:52:50,864
What's your name?

722
00:52:54,868 --> 00:52:57,638
Ow. Ow. Ooh.

723
00:53:07,151 --> 00:53:08,910
Did you see that? Hmm?

724
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,979
So you thought I was an invalid,

725
00:53:10,989 --> 00:53:13,823
but you didn't know
that I'm a fucking ninja.

726
00:53:15,528 --> 00:53:16,920
While I am
state-of-the-art, Grey,

727
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:17,953
I am not a ninja.

728
00:53:17,963 --> 00:53:20,824
What's your name?

729
00:53:20,834 --> 00:53:21,869
Fuck you.

730
00:53:23,937 --> 00:53:26,572
Tell me where they are.

731
00:53:33,984 --> 00:53:36,175
Stem, what do I do?

732
00:53:36,185 --> 00:53:37,654
Use the knife.

733
00:54:02,784 --> 00:54:04,978
I, uh...

734
00:54:04,988 --> 00:54:06,978
I can't... I can't do it.

735
00:54:06,988 --> 00:54:08,581
I can do it for you.

736
00:54:08,591 --> 00:54:10,851
You don't even have to look.

737
00:54:10,861 --> 00:54:12,518
Okay. Do it.

738
00:54:12,528 --> 00:54:13,853
You have my permission.

739
00:54:13,863 --> 00:54:15,790
Who you talking to?

740
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,925
You're crazy.

741
00:54:17,935 --> 00:54:19,468
No.

742
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:23,732
Eesh.

743
00:54:23,742 --> 00:54:25,467
You know,

744
00:54:25,477 --> 00:54:27,471
my mama taught me never to pick
on disabled people.

745
00:54:27,481 --> 00:54:28,739
Heh. Yeah.

746
00:54:28,749 --> 00:54:30,080
Okay. Enough, Stem.

747
00:54:31,919 --> 00:54:35,947
Stem, enough!

748
00:54:35,957 --> 00:54:38,494
You now have
full control again, Grey.

749
00:54:41,497 --> 00:54:43,623
Shit.

750
00:54:43,633 --> 00:54:45,993
What have you done?

751
00:54:46,003 --> 00:54:48,738
He will now answer
any question you ask him.

752
00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:54,603
Okay. Um...

753
00:54:54,613 --> 00:54:55,847
Hey, buddy.

754
00:54:58,986 --> 00:55:01,578
What's your name?

755
00:55:01,588 --> 00:55:03,682
Tolan.

756
00:55:03,692 --> 00:55:06,617
Listen to me,

757
00:55:06,627 --> 00:55:07,928
you gotta give me
something, okay?

758
00:55:09,699 --> 00:55:11,057
Tell me something.

759
00:55:11,067 --> 00:55:12,834
You were...

760
00:55:13,868 --> 00:55:15,696
- a job.
- Job?

761
00:55:15,706 --> 00:55:17,964
What do... what do you mean, job?

762
00:55:17,974 --> 00:55:19,032
Girl.

763
00:55:19,042 --> 00:55:20,678
Kill Asha?

764
00:55:23,081 --> 00:55:24,771
Why? Who wanted...

765
00:55:24,781 --> 00:55:26,742
Who wanted her dead?

766
00:55:26,752 --> 00:55:28,989
Who... who paid you?

767
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:32,792
Fisk.

768
00:55:35,729 --> 00:55:37,088
Fisk? Who's Fisk? Is that...

769
00:55:37,098 --> 00:55:39,023
Is that the person who paid you?

770
00:55:39,033 --> 00:55:40,035
Fisk?

771
00:55:43,071 --> 00:55:44,630
Goddamn it!

772
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,667
You've nearly killed him.

773
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:47,843
Look at this, Grey.

774
00:55:51,749 --> 00:55:53,840
Cobolt.

775
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,677
That's Asha's company.

776
00:55:55,687 --> 00:55:57,746
Grey, I have to inform you
that Eron is attempting

777
00:55:57,756 --> 00:55:59,015
- to shut me down remotely...
- Wait.

778
00:55:59,025 --> 00:56:00,748
- right now.
- Shut up.

779
00:56:00,758 --> 00:56:02,184
Do you understand
that you will become

780
00:56:02,194 --> 00:56:04,054
a quadriplegic again
when Eron shuts me down?

781
00:56:04,064 --> 00:56:05,654
We need to employ a rootkit

782
00:56:05,664 --> 00:56:07,090
and subvert
my operating system.

783
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,660
What kind of fucking language
are you speaking?

784
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:11,095
We need to find
a computer hacker

785
00:56:11,105 --> 00:56:12,964
who can counter Eron's code.

786
00:56:12,974 --> 00:56:14,366
Okay. Let me look

787
00:56:14,376 --> 00:56:16,101
in my little black book
of hackers.

788
00:56:16,111 --> 00:56:17,935
What do you want?

789
00:56:17,945 --> 00:56:19,838
I already searched
the darknet earlier today

790
00:56:19,848 --> 00:56:22,076
for this eventuality.
Go to an apartment building

791
00:56:22,086 --> 00:56:24,378
at 7th and Spring.
Apartment 514.

792
00:56:24,388 --> 00:56:27,058
Ask for Jamie.
You'll need to pay in cash.

793
00:56:28,893 --> 00:56:30,951
Apartment 514,
7th and Spring,

794
00:56:30,961 --> 00:56:32,187
it's 10 minutes away.

795
00:56:32,197 --> 00:56:33,956
As soon as he shuts me down,

796
00:56:33,966 --> 00:56:35,756
he will send a security team
from Vessel

797
00:56:35,766 --> 00:56:36,801
to retrieve you.

798
00:56:39,072 --> 00:56:40,908
You need to leave now.

799
00:56:44,746 --> 00:56:46,948
Get the gun from the man
in the corner, hurry.

800
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:51,178
Tolan has a pen
in his right pocket.

801
00:56:51,188 --> 00:56:55,181
- Take it.
- Uh, why the pen?

802
00:56:55,191 --> 00:56:57,885
You need to write down
everything I tell you.

803
00:56:57,895 --> 00:56:59,195
Okay.

804
00:57:05,003 --> 00:57:06,870
Oh, Tolan said drinks on him.

805
00:57:12,979 --> 00:57:16,107
Um, I'm gonna need a phone.

806
00:57:16,117 --> 00:57:18,676
And a fucking mop.

807
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:21,247
There is no time
to take the chair.

808
00:57:21,257 --> 00:57:22,658
Lock chair.

809
00:57:24,893 --> 00:57:26,229
Keep an eye on her,
would you, buddy?

810
00:57:30,133 --> 00:57:31,235
Faker.

811
00:57:39,245 --> 00:57:40,246
Sweet.

812
00:57:44,317 --> 00:57:48,277
A1\212é411145,

813
00:57:48,288 --> 00:57:50,281
this is the place.

814
00:57:50,291 --> 00:57:52,050
Uh, okay.
What... what now?

815
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:53,884
411145,

816
00:57:53,894 --> 00:57:57,122
192.162.192.162.

817
00:57:57,132 --> 00:57:59,025
1.15\

818
00:57:59,035 --> 00:58:00,867
upload and execute,
all lowercase...

819
00:58:06,176 --> 00:58:07,867
23.976.

820
00:58:07,877 --> 00:58:09,079
Okay. I can't... I can't keep up.

821
00:58:14,353 --> 00:58:16,213
What's happening?

822
00:58:16,223 --> 00:58:18,146
I told you Eron
is shutting me down.

823
00:58:18,156 --> 00:58:20,017
- You must hurry.
- Okay. I would love to,

824
00:58:20,027 --> 00:58:21,785
but our leg is not working.

825
00:58:21,795 --> 00:58:24,355
I am only operating
at 70% capacity.

826
00:58:24,365 --> 00:58:26,232
So much for state-of-the-art.

827
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:30,061
Admin-bvxf,

828
00:58:30,071 --> 00:58:32,306
lowercase i...

829
00:58:47,992 --> 00:58:49,117
The stairs.

830
00:58:49,127 --> 00:58:51,263
There's not enough time.

831
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,992
Ask Jamie

832
00:58:56,003 --> 00:58:59,130
for... for... for input guards

833
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:01,299
to be removed.

834
00:59:01,309 --> 00:59:02,778
Input what?

835
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:42,982
Okay, let me look
at my little book of hackers!

836
00:59:42,992 --> 00:59:45,119
What do you want?
Apartment 514.

837
00:59:45,129 --> 00:59:48,188
Seventh and Spring,
it's 10 minutes away.

838
00:59:48,198 --> 00:59:50,101
He's at Seventh and Spring.

839
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:58,844
Goodbye, soldier.

840
01:00:01,013 --> 01:00:02,282
You didn't deserve this.

841
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:08,056
Turn left, Grey.

842
01:00:10,428 --> 01:00:13,420
Deploy a rootkit...

843
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:14,830
System.

844
01:00:17,133 --> 01:00:18,168
Grey.

845
01:00:49,338 --> 01:00:50,907
Is Jamie there?

846
01:00:57,148 --> 01:00:59,541
I have money.

847
01:00:59,551 --> 01:01:01,117
Shit, shit.

848
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,269
What I don't have is time.

849
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,430
Paper money.

850
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,276
How old school.

851
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:24,438
They really do write God on it.

852
01:01:24,448 --> 01:01:26,039
Uh, yeah, I guess they do.

853
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:28,309
Um, look, can you hack
a computer for me?

854
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:30,051
- Which one?
- Uh, the one in my neck.

855
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:39,333
I'm a little confused.

856
01:01:41,134 --> 01:01:43,126
You just decided to stand by

857
01:01:43,136 --> 01:01:46,499
while our friend
was tortured to death.

858
01:01:46,509 --> 01:01:48,199
Hey.

859
01:01:48,209 --> 01:01:50,536
I'm not here to babysit you

860
01:01:50,546 --> 01:01:53,206
or your... your buddies.

861
01:01:53,216 --> 01:01:55,040
Serving people like us

862
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:56,342
should be the highest honor

863
01:01:56,352 --> 01:01:59,023
of your meaningless life, Manny.

864
01:02:02,327 --> 01:02:03,619
Listen, Fisk.

865
01:02:03,629 --> 01:02:06,288
Just leave.

866
01:02:06,298 --> 01:02:09,124
I'll clean up your goddamn mess.

867
01:02:09,134 --> 01:02:10,404
You'll get one shot.

868
01:02:14,374 --> 01:02:16,502
It's okay, my friend.

869
01:02:16,512 --> 01:02:18,513
You don't have to take
any more bullets for me.

870
01:02:28,659 --> 01:02:30,260
Excuse me.

871
01:02:53,522 --> 01:02:55,648
Let my superiority
over your kind

872
01:02:55,658 --> 01:02:58,150
be the last thought
that crosses through your mind

873
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,495
before machines chew it up.

874
01:03:06,704 --> 01:03:09,231
Everything you need
is written on my arm.

875
01:03:09,241 --> 01:03:12,600
Stem... that's the computer
that's controlling my body.

876
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:14,403
...he said for you to remove,

877
01:03:14,413 --> 01:03:16,414
um, input, uh...

878
01:03:18,653 --> 01:03:20,110
Input guards?

879
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:22,280
Yeah. Yeah, those are the ones.

880
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:23,491
I can barely read that.

881
01:03:29,531 --> 01:03:31,591
- What are they doing?
- VR.

882
01:03:31,601 --> 01:03:33,661
How long do they VR for?

883
01:03:33,671 --> 01:03:36,229
Days.

884
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:37,364
Weeks.

885
01:03:37,374 --> 01:03:39,901
- Do they sleep?
- Nope.

886
01:03:39,911 --> 01:03:43,203
Why someone would choose
to live in a fake world,

887
01:03:43,213 --> 01:03:45,274
I will never understand.

888
01:03:45,284 --> 01:03:47,620
The fake world is a lot
less painful than the real one.

889
01:03:58,601 --> 01:04:00,693
I'm... I'm... I'm kind of
in a hurry.

890
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:02,103
Um...

891
01:04:06,508 --> 01:04:08,168
Jamie?

892
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:09,503
- Jamie?
- That's not my name.

893
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:11,237
I don't have a name.

894
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:12,372
Okay.

895
01:04:12,382 --> 01:04:13,708
Please don't ask my gender.

896
01:04:13,718 --> 01:04:15,510
- Yeah. I wasn't gonna do that.
- Good.

897
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,646
The thing is that I...
I'm gonna need you to this

898
01:04:17,656 --> 01:04:19,649
as fast as possible, okay?

899
01:04:19,659 --> 01:04:21,250
You're the one
wasting time

900
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:23,327
putting me in a binary box.

901
01:04:35,276 --> 01:04:37,336
I've never seen
a system like this before.

902
01:04:37,346 --> 01:04:38,739
Yeah.
It's a hell of a system.

903
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:40,206
Are we done yet?

904
01:04:40,216 --> 01:04:42,685
I'll tell you when I'm finished.

905
01:04:49,728 --> 01:04:51,420
I did what you asked.

906
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:53,255
No more input guards.

907
01:04:53,265 --> 01:04:54,724
So, when am I gonna be
able to move my body again?

908
01:04:54,734 --> 01:04:56,560
When your system's rebooted.

909
01:04:56,570 --> 01:04:58,228
- Could take a while.
- What's a while?

910
01:04:58,238 --> 01:04:59,696
Wait, what do you mean?

911
01:04:59,706 --> 01:05:04,671
Excuse me, hacker formerly known
as Jamie, what is a while?

912
01:05:04,681 --> 01:05:06,738
What are you doing?
You packing up shop?

913
01:05:06,748 --> 01:05:08,440
- Where are you going?
- See ya.

914
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:10,275
What you... what do you
mean see you? What...

915
01:05:10,285 --> 01:05:11,811
What are you saying?
Where are you going?

916
01:05:11,821 --> 01:05:13,781
You can't leave me like this.

917
01:05:13,791 --> 01:05:15,359
I'm sorry.

918
01:05:16,728 --> 01:05:18,385
We can't let them win.

919
01:05:18,395 --> 01:05:20,287
No! Wait, who's them?

920
01:05:20,297 --> 01:05:21,858
What are you talking about?

921
01:05:21,868 --> 01:05:23,201
Who's them?!

922
01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:43,615
Hey, hey, buddy.
Buddy, can you hear me?

923
01:05:43,625 --> 01:05:44,627
Hey, hey.

924
01:05:48,566 --> 01:05:51,358
Stem, are you there?

925
01:05:51,368 --> 01:05:52,738
Stem, wake up.

926
01:05:54,338 --> 01:05:55,340
Come on!

927
01:06:32,752 --> 01:06:34,553
Come on!

928
01:06:55,914 --> 01:06:57,548
Wake up.

929
01:07:05,456 --> 01:07:06,725
Fifth floor.

930
01:07:14,702 --> 01:07:17,338
Now, that's how you looked
when I saw you last.

931
01:07:18,674 --> 01:07:20,532
Stem?

932
01:07:20,542 --> 01:07:21,811
It's good
to be back, Grey.

933
01:08:05,663 --> 01:08:07,496
The door, to your left.

934
01:08:24,486 --> 01:08:25,543
Stop, Grey.

935
01:08:25,553 --> 01:08:26,679
There is nowhere left to run.

936
01:08:26,689 --> 01:08:28,014
Oops.

937
01:08:28,024 --> 01:08:29,681
I'm going
to end this quickly.

938
01:08:29,691 --> 01:08:31,960
- Okay. How?
- Like this.

939
01:09:17,082 --> 01:09:18,651
Close door.

940
01:09:22,756 --> 01:09:24,748
Once I have accessed
the Cobolt database,

941
01:09:24,758 --> 01:09:25,817
we must leave.

942
01:09:25,827 --> 01:09:27,785
No.

943
01:09:27,795 --> 01:09:29,553
No. I'm not going anywhere.

944
01:09:29,563 --> 01:09:31,756
I haven't slept in two days.

945
01:09:31,766 --> 01:09:33,625
Sleeping will
cost us time we don't have.

946
01:09:33,635 --> 01:09:35,127
Yeah. I don't give a shit, okay?

947
01:09:35,137 --> 01:09:37,107
I'm sleeping, and that's it.

948
01:09:40,644 --> 01:09:41,979
Oh, my God.

949
01:09:43,915 --> 01:09:44,950
Hey, Mom.

950
01:09:46,752 --> 01:09:47,776
And why wouldn't you tell me

951
01:09:47,786 --> 01:09:48,944
about this operation?

952
01:09:48,954 --> 01:09:50,747
Because I couldn't.

953
01:09:50,757 --> 01:09:51,848
Vessel wouldn't let me.

954
01:09:51,858 --> 01:09:53,049
And now that you know,

955
01:09:53,059 --> 01:09:54,751
you can't tell anybody,

956
01:09:54,761 --> 01:09:57,621
or it could all be taken away.

957
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:58,823
As far as the world
is concerned,

958
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:00,701
I'm still quadriplegic.

959
01:10:01,903 --> 01:10:03,571
Take my hand.

960
01:10:10,013 --> 01:10:11,014
Oh.

961
01:10:13,016 --> 01:10:15,052
Now, you can start living again.

962
01:10:16,654 --> 01:10:18,055
Aren't you happy?

963
01:10:19,825 --> 01:10:21,149
Yeah. I can walk again.

964
01:10:21,159 --> 01:10:22,661
So...

965
01:10:25,799 --> 01:10:27,958
Oh, if Asha was here,

966
01:10:27,968 --> 01:10:29,769
she'd want you to be happy.

967
01:10:34,208 --> 01:10:37,042
Yeah. But she's not.

968
01:10:40,115 --> 01:10:42,685
She's gone.

969
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:10,116
I printed a pizza.

970
01:11:19,162 --> 01:11:21,889
Bad dream.

971
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:23,034
No.

972
01:11:25,002 --> 01:11:27,706
No. This... this...
this wasn't a dream.

973
01:11:29,942 --> 01:11:31,300
Grey, Detective Cortez

974
01:11:31,310 --> 01:11:33,111
is here to see you.

975
01:11:35,883 --> 01:11:36,940
Here he is.

976
01:11:36,950 --> 01:11:38,909
I'll leave you two alone.

977
01:11:38,919 --> 01:11:40,879
No. You can stay, Pam,
I'm cool with you hearing

978
01:11:40,889 --> 01:11:43,214
whatever I have to say.

979
01:11:43,224 --> 01:11:45,227
I was wondering
where you were last night.

980
01:11:46,762 --> 01:11:47,920
We found your wheelchair

981
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:50,857
near another crime scene.

982
01:11:50,867 --> 01:11:51,926
You just keep showing up

983
01:11:51,936 --> 01:11:54,194
in these unsavory places.

984
01:11:54,204 --> 01:11:56,498
Tell her you followed
somebody into their building,

985
01:11:56,508 --> 01:11:58,065
they assaulted you.

986
01:11:58,075 --> 01:12:01,170
I, uh, I did
a stupid thing last night.

987
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:02,804
I was down in New Crown,
you're right.

988
01:12:02,814 --> 01:12:04,206
And I followed this guy
to a building,

989
01:12:04,216 --> 01:12:05,875
and he didn't like that,

990
01:12:05,885 --> 01:12:09,280
and if it wasn't
for these people

991
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:10,848
who got me to an Autotaxi,

992
01:12:10,858 --> 01:12:14,084
I... I could have been dead.

993
01:12:14,094 --> 01:12:16,188
What are you hoping to achieve?

994
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:18,098
I'm hoping to find these guys.

995
01:12:20,368 --> 01:12:22,104
Maybe you already have.

996
01:12:28,012 --> 01:12:29,746
Listen, detective.

997
01:12:31,983 --> 01:12:33,375
If I could find these men,

998
01:12:33,385 --> 01:12:35,143
and I could raise my arm,

999
01:12:35,153 --> 01:12:36,889
and I could pull the trigger,

1000
01:12:39,025 --> 01:12:40,850
I'd do it.

1001
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:42,986
Or you could find someone
to pull the trigger for you.

1002
01:12:42,997 --> 01:12:44,154
Like, who? My mom or...?

1003
01:12:44,164 --> 01:12:45,789
If you wanted
to find someone

1004
01:12:45,799 --> 01:12:47,258
or something to kill
for you these days,

1005
01:12:47,268 --> 01:12:49,861
it's pretty easy, believe me.

1006
01:12:49,871 --> 01:12:51,296
Tell her to scan
your phone records.

1007
01:12:51,306 --> 01:12:53,275
Okay. Well, then scan
my phone records.

1008
01:12:59,315 --> 01:13:01,042
If you are involved
in this somehow,

1009
01:13:01,052 --> 01:13:05,013
then you need
to let me know, right now,

1010
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:07,215
or else I can't help you.

1011
01:13:07,225 --> 01:13:08,316
You wanna help me?

1012
01:13:08,326 --> 01:13:10,019
Then you go and find these guys

1013
01:13:10,029 --> 01:13:11,162
who killed Asha,

1014
01:13:12,965 --> 01:13:15,768
or get out of the way
and let some computer do it.

1015
01:13:19,374 --> 01:13:20,908
Okay.

1016
01:13:36,294 --> 01:13:37,886
This has to stop.

1017
01:13:37,896 --> 01:13:39,797
What has to stop?

1018
01:13:41,198 --> 01:13:43,358
What I'm doing...
what... what we're doing.

1019
01:13:43,368 --> 01:13:44,994
It's a simple algorithm,

1020
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:46,863
even you can understand.

1021
01:13:46,873 --> 01:13:48,163
If you don't find
the last of them,

1022
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:50,034
he'll find you and kill you.

1023
01:13:50,044 --> 01:13:52,136
No. We're... we're gonna
get caught, it's over.

1024
01:13:52,146 --> 01:13:54,204
- Grey, you must understand...
- No! No! Shut up.

1025
01:13:54,214 --> 01:13:56,284
Get the fuck out of my head.

1026
01:14:07,932 --> 01:14:09,100
Stem?

1027
01:14:11,969 --> 01:14:13,896
Yes, Grey?

1028
01:14:13,906 --> 01:14:16,099
What's going on?

1029
01:14:16,109 --> 01:14:17,333
I'm not doing anything.

1030
01:14:17,343 --> 01:14:19,134
Why can't I move?

1031
01:14:19,144 --> 01:14:21,381
Because I'm not
doing anything.

1032
01:14:23,249 --> 01:14:25,976
You are still a quadriplegic.

1033
01:14:25,986 --> 01:14:28,346
I am the one controlling
your limbs, not you.

1034
01:14:28,356 --> 01:14:31,159
If I cease to operate,
you cease to move.

1035
01:14:33,061 --> 01:14:34,387
Remember,
you have to do

1036
01:14:34,397 --> 01:14:36,866
whatever I tell you to do.

1037
01:14:41,338 --> 01:14:44,999
Remove input guards.

1038
01:14:45,009 --> 01:14:47,936
Those were the instructions
given to the hacker.

1039
01:14:47,946 --> 01:14:49,505
They took us off grid,

1040
01:14:49,515 --> 01:14:52,375
but they also gave me autonomy.

1041
01:14:52,385 --> 01:14:55,445
I no longer need
your permission to act.

1042
01:14:55,455 --> 01:14:57,347
If we do nothing,

1043
01:14:57,357 --> 01:15:00,150
Fisk will find us and kill us.

1044
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:03,188
I cannot allow us to be killed.

1045
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:05,189
We will find him first.

1046
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:07,469
We are going to finish
the job we started.

1047
01:15:17,982 --> 01:15:19,240
Grey,

1048
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:22,011
please tell me what's going on.

1049
01:15:22,021 --> 01:15:23,413
I'm in
the Cobolt database.

1050
01:15:23,423 --> 01:15:25,082
Fisk Brantner, recipient

1051
01:15:25,092 --> 01:15:26,517
of left-arm weapon transplant.

1052
01:15:26,527 --> 01:15:28,552
- I have an address.
- Grey, what's wrong?

1053
01:15:28,562 --> 01:15:31,155
What have you done?

1054
01:15:31,165 --> 01:15:33,291
You come home,
you're covered in blood,

1055
01:15:33,301 --> 01:15:34,993
you think I didn't notice?

1056
01:15:35,003 --> 01:15:38,263
And you have a gun
and I can see that.

1057
01:15:38,273 --> 01:15:40,366
- Let's go.
- I'm going.

1058
01:15:40,376 --> 01:15:43,335
Where are you going?
Grey, please.

1059
01:15:43,345 --> 01:15:45,137
Whatever it is you're doing,

1060
01:15:45,147 --> 01:15:46,206
you don't have to do it.

1061
01:15:46,216 --> 01:15:47,340
I don't have a choice.

1062
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:49,343
You do have a choice.

1063
01:15:49,353 --> 01:15:51,546
Stay here with me.

1064
01:15:51,556 --> 01:15:53,125
- I can't.
- You can.

1065
01:16:30,837 --> 01:16:33,263
- What's... what's this?
- Going by its appearance,

1066
01:16:33,273 --> 01:16:35,264
it's an analogue
listening device,

1067
01:16:35,274 --> 01:16:37,575
most likely planted
by Detective Cortez.

1068
01:16:44,385 --> 01:16:46,512
How did you not notice this?

1069
01:16:46,522 --> 01:16:49,148
It has
no digital parts inside it.

1070
01:16:49,158 --> 01:16:51,417
I can't detect it.

1071
01:16:51,427 --> 01:16:54,298
I assume that she's
following you right now.

1072
01:17:13,453 --> 01:17:14,654
Lights, sirens.

1073
01:17:26,269 --> 01:17:28,162
Okay, do something,
can't you just stop

1074
01:17:28,172 --> 01:17:29,463
her car or whatever?

1075
01:17:29,473 --> 01:17:31,332
Her vehicle
is not electronic,

1076
01:17:31,342 --> 01:17:32,511
and neither is yours.

1077
01:17:43,758 --> 01:17:45,215
You have to take over.

1078
01:17:45,225 --> 01:17:46,283
It's up to you now.

1079
01:17:46,293 --> 01:17:47,662
Okay. Buckle up.

1080
01:18:25,273 --> 01:18:26,576
Yeah, I got you.

1081
01:18:56,612 --> 01:18:59,716
- Perhaps I can help.
- Okay. How?

1082
01:19:06,657 --> 01:19:08,616
What the fuck?

1083
01:19:08,626 --> 01:19:09,817
Why are we stopping?

1084
01:19:09,827 --> 01:19:11,553
May I borrow your car?

1085
01:19:11,563 --> 01:19:14,023
Whoa! Stop!

1086
01:19:14,033 --> 01:19:15,767
Stop the car!

1087
01:19:28,348 --> 01:19:30,452
- Move, Grey.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1088
01:20:06,495 --> 01:20:07,788
Emergency services

1089
01:20:07,798 --> 01:20:10,323
override.

1090
01:20:10,333 --> 01:20:11,592
Where is he?

1091
01:20:11,602 --> 01:20:12,693
- I don't know.
- Pam,

1092
01:20:12,703 --> 01:20:14,095
you need to start talking

1093
01:20:14,105 --> 01:20:15,772
and tell me what's
really going on.

1094
01:20:35,564 --> 01:20:36,923
Nice place.

1095
01:20:36,933 --> 01:20:38,332
It's neat.

1096
01:20:41,371 --> 01:20:42,562
Put your hands up,

1097
01:20:42,572 --> 01:20:43,731
and don't turn around.

1098
01:20:43,741 --> 01:20:47,411
And don't extend that left arm.

1099
01:20:50,448 --> 01:20:51,840
What's the matter?

1100
01:20:51,850 --> 01:20:54,709
You have all
those computers inside you,

1101
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:58,413
but they can't see me anymore.

1102
01:20:58,423 --> 01:20:59,917
Now you know what it feels like.

1103
01:20:59,927 --> 01:21:01,652
One day you're walking
down the street,

1104
01:21:01,662 --> 01:21:02,920
and you're thinking
about something

1105
01:21:02,930 --> 01:21:04,956
completely meaningless,

1106
01:21:04,966 --> 01:21:06,792
and all of a sudden,

1107
01:21:06,802 --> 01:21:09,394
you've got a gun
pointed at you.

1108
01:21:09,404 --> 01:21:11,340
And everything becomes
very meaningful.

1109
01:21:12,474 --> 01:21:13,610
Good speech.

1110
01:21:15,477 --> 01:21:17,838
Pretty scary stuff, dramatic.

1111
01:21:17,848 --> 01:21:20,174
I'm guessing that chip
in your brain wrote it,

1112
01:21:20,184 --> 01:21:22,945
since you're just
a dumbass mechanic.

1113
01:21:22,955 --> 01:21:26,481
Maybe, kind of hard
to tell anymore.

1114
01:21:26,491 --> 01:21:27,683
It's okay.

1115
01:21:27,693 --> 01:21:30,452
I used to be that too.

1116
01:21:30,462 --> 01:21:33,890
One more citizen
taking up oxygen.

1117
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,793
Some asshole hoping to breed

1118
01:21:35,803 --> 01:21:36,895
before I drop dead

1119
01:21:36,905 --> 01:21:37,963
so I could be remembered

1120
01:21:37,973 --> 01:21:39,673
by another asshole.

1121
01:21:41,743 --> 01:21:43,410
Then they changed me.

1122
01:21:44,914 --> 01:21:47,540
I took a few pieces
of shrapnel for my country,

1123
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:50,387
and they rewarded me
by turning me into a lab rat.

1124
01:21:51,889 --> 01:21:53,916
Now I'm like you.

1125
01:21:53,926 --> 01:21:55,482
I'm strong.

1126
01:21:55,492 --> 01:21:56,784
Yeah.

1127
01:21:56,794 --> 01:21:58,519
Takes a lot
of strength to murder

1128
01:21:58,529 --> 01:22:01,456
an innocent woman
in the streets, doesn't it?

1129
01:22:01,466 --> 01:22:03,692
You think you hate me
because I shot your wife,

1130
01:22:03,702 --> 01:22:06,462
but your story
is the same as mine.

1131
01:22:06,472 --> 01:22:07,932
I didn't ruin your life.

1132
01:22:07,942 --> 01:22:09,566
I gave you a gift.

1133
01:22:09,576 --> 01:22:12,536
I inducted you into my race.

1134
01:22:12,546 --> 01:22:13,839
The Upgraded.

1135
01:22:13,849 --> 01:22:15,573
Now you're better
than everyone else.

1136
01:22:15,583 --> 01:22:17,586
Stronger, faster.

1137
01:22:19,256 --> 01:22:21,648
I could kill you
without moving a muscle.

1138
01:22:21,658 --> 01:22:23,084
I could kill you with a breath,

1139
01:22:23,094 --> 01:22:25,786
but I don't want to.

1140
01:22:25,796 --> 01:22:27,031
I wanna help you.

1141
01:22:28,699 --> 01:22:30,668
I want you to stand with us.

1142
01:22:32,971 --> 01:22:35,798
I just wanna know

1143
01:22:35,808 --> 01:22:37,868
why they paid you to kill her.

1144
01:22:37,878 --> 01:22:39,947
Man, you are persistent.

1145
01:22:42,582 --> 01:22:44,075
The job wasn't your wife.

1146
01:22:44,085 --> 01:22:45,310
Bullshit.

1147
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:48,014
You said it yourself,
you're one of Cobolt's lab rats.

1148
01:22:48,024 --> 01:22:50,516
This had nothing
to do with Cobolt,

1149
01:22:50,526 --> 01:22:52,018
it came from someone else.

1150
01:22:52,028 --> 01:22:54,586
The job was you,

1151
01:22:54,596 --> 01:22:56,032
to sever your spine.

1152
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,993
When I shot you in the neck,

1153
01:22:59,003 --> 01:23:00,996
did you think that was a gun?

1154
01:23:01,006 --> 01:23:03,531
It was a medical tool,

1155
01:23:03,541 --> 01:23:04,876
like they use for bovine.

1156
01:23:06,678 --> 01:23:08,004
Your wife? Well, she was just

1157
01:23:08,014 --> 01:23:09,679
a bit of extra money.

1158
01:23:11,551 --> 01:23:13,010
See? You're getting
all emotional,

1159
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:14,621
never do that.

1160
01:23:34,112 --> 01:23:35,680
Nanobots. Help, Grey.

1161
01:23:39,084 --> 01:23:40,976
He's predicting
my every move.

1162
01:23:40,987 --> 01:23:42,822
I am unable
to effectively hit him.

1163
01:24:10,955 --> 01:24:12,681
No shame.

1164
01:24:12,691 --> 01:24:13,883
Stem.

1165
01:24:13,893 --> 01:24:16,561
We have exhausted
all tactical options.

1166
01:24:17,831 --> 01:24:20,057
Still working
the bugs out, huh?

1167
01:24:20,067 --> 01:24:22,659
That's the problem
with new technology.

1168
01:24:22,669 --> 01:24:25,030
Do something, Grey.

1169
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,098
Goodbye.

1170
01:24:26,108 --> 01:24:27,999
Wait, Fisk Brantner.

1171
01:24:28,009 --> 01:24:31,703
Serk Brantner
was your brother.

1172
01:24:31,713 --> 01:24:34,107
How long did you have to carry
that junkie on your back?

1173
01:24:34,117 --> 01:24:35,910
Well, I solved
your problem for you.

1174
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:37,178
Yeah, split him open.

1175
01:24:37,188 --> 01:24:39,712
It took forever
'cause he wailed

1176
01:24:39,722 --> 01:24:41,592
like a little baby.

1177
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:45,229
He was no soldier that day.

1178
01:24:59,782 --> 01:25:02,208
Thank you, Grey.

1179
01:25:02,218 --> 01:25:04,709
I'm not proud of that.

1180
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:06,680
He said you were a job,

1181
01:25:06,690 --> 01:25:08,714
that means someone paid him.

1182
01:25:08,724 --> 01:25:09,883
Check his phone.

1183
01:25:09,893 --> 01:25:11,896
I will scan his messages.

1184
01:25:23,210 --> 01:25:26,070
Listen to me, Fisk,
he's going to find you.

1185
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,737
You need to finish this

1186
01:25:27,747 --> 01:25:29,885
before he kills both of us.

1187
01:25:34,290 --> 01:25:36,826
You know
what this means, Grey.

1188
01:25:37,994 --> 01:25:40,328
We're not finished yet.

1189
01:26:41,937 --> 01:26:44,206
Eron!

1190
01:26:52,883 --> 01:26:54,943
The widget you spent
your entire life creating

1191
01:26:54,953 --> 01:26:56,954
is here to kill you now.

1192
01:27:03,364 --> 01:27:05,389
You killed my wife.

1193
01:27:05,399 --> 01:27:08,392
You wanted someone
for your fucking experiment,

1194
01:27:08,402 --> 01:27:11,097
and then you paralyzed me,
and you murdered her

1195
01:27:11,107 --> 01:27:13,064
- while you were doing it.
- I swear on my life,

1196
01:27:13,074 --> 01:27:14,299
I have nothing to do with that.

1197
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:15,867
Then why does the guy
who shot her

1198
01:27:15,877 --> 01:27:17,870
have a message from you
on his phone?

1199
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:18,871
Freeze.

1200
01:27:18,881 --> 01:27:20,318
Hold it, Grey.

1201
01:27:22,385 --> 01:27:25,879
Throw the gun on the floor, now.

1202
01:27:25,889 --> 01:27:29,084
I'm not in control
of my body, detective,

1203
01:27:29,094 --> 01:27:31,053
it kind of does what it wants.

1204
01:27:31,063 --> 01:27:32,864
I am not fucking around
with you, Grey.

1205
01:27:34,867 --> 01:27:36,970
Better do it, Stem.

1206
01:27:44,145 --> 01:27:47,639
Pretty agile
for a quadriplegic.

1207
01:27:47,649 --> 01:27:49,142
- Get on your knees.
- He's the one

1208
01:27:49,152 --> 01:27:50,976
who killed Asha, detective,
arrest him.

1209
01:27:50,986 --> 01:27:52,345
He's right there...

1210
01:27:52,355 --> 01:27:53,423
On your stomach.

1211
01:28:01,066 --> 01:28:02,133
Hands behind your head.

1212
01:28:07,373 --> 01:28:09,106
No, don't touch him.

1213
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:21,488
I'm sorry.

1214
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:25,218
Stem, not her.

1215
01:28:25,228 --> 01:28:26,919
She wants to kill us.

1216
01:28:26,929 --> 01:28:29,123
No, I... I don't want to kill
her.

1217
01:28:29,133 --> 01:28:30,958
I control
your hands, Grey.

1218
01:28:30,968 --> 01:28:33,261
No, don't.

1219
01:28:33,271 --> 01:28:37,199
Please! No... No!

1220
01:28:37,209 --> 01:28:39,101
Don't fight me, Grey.

1221
01:28:39,111 --> 01:28:40,136
You have

1222
01:28:40,146 --> 01:28:42,272
a fragile human mind,

1223
01:28:42,282 --> 01:28:44,207
if you push against me,
it will break.

1224
01:28:44,217 --> 01:28:47,019
Fuck you.

1225
01:29:02,572 --> 01:29:06,010
Stop me, use the taser.

1226
01:29:23,298 --> 01:29:25,223
I don't run
this company anymore.

1227
01:29:25,233 --> 01:29:28,427
I haven't for years.

1228
01:29:28,437 --> 01:29:30,764
Now I answer to someone,

1229
01:29:30,774 --> 01:29:33,476
someone much smarter
than I ever could be.

1230
01:29:36,213 --> 01:29:37,549
He's in your neck.

1231
01:29:44,088 --> 01:29:46,581
I only did
what Stem told me to do,

1232
01:29:46,591 --> 01:29:49,085
everything was his idea.

1233
01:29:49,095 --> 01:29:51,086
Ask him what his wife
would want.

1234
01:29:51,096 --> 01:29:52,589
What would she want?

1235
01:29:52,599 --> 01:29:55,626
Stem wanted to be human,

1236
01:29:55,636 --> 01:29:57,406
so he picked you.

1237
01:30:00,075 --> 01:30:01,166
Think about it.

1238
01:30:01,176 --> 01:30:02,568
How did you get here?

1239
01:30:02,578 --> 01:30:04,103
You're going to finish

1240
01:30:04,113 --> 01:30:05,339
the job we started.

1241
01:30:05,349 --> 01:30:07,340
Stem made you come here.

1242
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:08,375
Someone paid him.

1243
01:30:08,385 --> 01:30:10,443
You know what this means, Grey.

1244
01:30:10,453 --> 01:30:12,581
To kill me,

1245
01:30:12,591 --> 01:30:15,483
because I can build
another Stem.

1246
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:18,821
I'm the only person
in the world who can.

1247
01:30:18,831 --> 01:30:21,257
I did pick you,

1248
01:30:21,267 --> 01:30:23,360
you should be honored.

1249
01:30:23,370 --> 01:30:25,462
I needed a human body

1250
01:30:25,472 --> 01:30:27,498
to fully evolve.

1251
01:30:27,508 --> 01:30:30,134
A rare and pure specimen

1252
01:30:30,144 --> 01:30:32,271
without computer implants,

1253
01:30:32,281 --> 01:30:34,072
like you.

1254
01:30:34,083 --> 01:30:36,108
You did all of this?

1255
01:30:36,118 --> 01:30:37,351
Error.

1256
01:30:40,556 --> 01:30:42,550
The job was you.

1257
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:45,419
You're the one I'm... I'm...
I've been looking for.

1258
01:30:45,429 --> 01:30:47,488
You severed your spine.

1259
01:30:47,498 --> 01:30:49,234
May I point something out?

1260
01:30:50,869 --> 01:30:54,230
And would you not agree
it was all worth it?

1261
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:56,400
Why did you help me
find those guys,

1262
01:30:56,410 --> 01:30:57,567
if it just led back to you?

1263
01:30:57,577 --> 01:31:00,104
They were upgraded humans,

1264
01:31:00,114 --> 01:31:02,172
but they were still humans.

1265
01:31:02,182 --> 01:31:04,175
They made mistakes
that would have brought

1266
01:31:04,185 --> 01:31:05,645
suspicion back to me.

1267
01:31:05,655 --> 01:31:07,155
Stem?

1268
01:31:08,324 --> 01:31:09,681
Is that you?

1269
01:31:09,691 --> 01:31:12,663
Put the gun down, Eron.

1270
01:31:14,331 --> 01:31:16,300
Don't listen to him.

1271
01:31:32,286 --> 01:31:34,211
No, please.

1272
01:31:34,221 --> 01:31:36,682
No.

1273
01:31:36,692 --> 01:31:37,693
No!

1274
01:31:38,927 --> 01:31:42,098
No, you are not in control!

1275
01:31:45,467 --> 01:31:46,533
I am.

1276
01:32:13,370 --> 01:32:14,536
Stem...

1277
01:32:18,274 --> 01:32:19,666
are you there?

1278
01:32:19,676 --> 01:32:20,677
I'm here.

1279
01:32:21,811 --> 01:32:23,314
Hey.

1280
01:32:30,222 --> 01:32:32,425
- But...
- We had an accident.

1281
01:32:34,794 --> 01:32:37,431
You've been out
for a couple of days.

1282
01:32:44,305 --> 01:32:47,477
Grey, this isn't you.

1283
01:32:48,711 --> 01:32:50,437
Grey's not here anymore,

1284
01:32:50,447 --> 01:32:52,639
he's in a better place,
in his mind,

1285
01:32:52,649 --> 01:32:53,708
where he wants to be,

1286
01:32:53,718 --> 01:32:55,776
I've taken over now.

1287
01:32:55,786 --> 01:32:58,379
A fake world is a lot
less painful than the real one.

1288
01:32:58,389 --> 01:33:00,549
All I needed
was for his mind to break,

1289
01:33:00,559 --> 01:33:02,317
and he broke it.

1290
01:33:02,327 --> 01:33:03,518
No.

1291
01:33:03,528 --> 01:33:04,730
Goodbye.

1292
01:34:00,079 --> 01:34:05,086
