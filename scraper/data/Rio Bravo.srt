1
00:04:43,342 --> 00:04:45,052
Joe, you're under arrest.

2
00:04:45,344 --> 00:04:47,929
Maybe so, but don't turn around, Sheriff.

3
00:04:48,513 --> 00:04:50,515
Now what're you going to do, Sheriff?

4
00:04:59,191 --> 00:05:01,443
You can do just about what you want, Chance.

5
00:05:04,613 --> 00:05:06,615
Anybody else you want besides Joe?

6
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:10,077
No.

7
00:05:11,536 --> 00:05:12,871
Give me a hand.

8
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,215
- What is all this?
- Hello, Mr. Wheeler.

9
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:08,385
Tell your men to stay with the wagons
till they're told different.

10
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,971
Who the devil do you think you're ordering
around here?

11
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:14,433
First Burdette's men stop me
and now you stand there and try...

12
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:19,062
- Say, seems like I ought to know you.
- Think you do, Mr. Wheeler.

13
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:21,523
Yeah, I remember you now.

14
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:25,068
That star you're wearing
kind of threw me off for a minute.

15
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:28,322
Aren't you the fellow
the Mexicans used to call borrachín?

16
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,408
That's nearly right. Only it's borrachón.

17
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,411
I don't think I've ever seen you
like this before.

18
00:06:35,203 --> 00:06:37,998
You mean sober? You're probably right.

19
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:39,750
You know what borrachón means?

20
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,793
My Spanish ain't too good.

21
00:06:41,877 --> 00:06:43,420
It means drunk.

22
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:47,007
Now if the name bothers you,
they used to call me "Dude."

23
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,885
Now are you going
to tell your men or do I?

24
00:06:50,552 --> 00:06:52,179
I'll tell my men.

25
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,937
Stand by the wagons, everybody!

26
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:01,730
Pass the word.

27
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,764
Chance, what's going on here?

28
00:07:35,847 --> 00:07:39,101
People stopping me. Everybody telling me
what I can and can't do.

29
00:07:39,184 --> 00:07:41,395
Next thing, you'll be telling me what to do.

30
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:43,146
- Pat, I will tell you.
- What?

31
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,691
- Stop your wagons.
- I give up.

32
00:07:49,778 --> 00:07:53,615
Now don't tell me what's going on.
Just leave me wandering around in the fog.

33
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,660
I like it. I'm getting used to it.
It makes me feel so good.

34
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:59,454
You better look out, Pat,
you'll blow up and bust.

35
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:02,833
Listen, Chance, remember me?
Your old friend Pat Wheeler.

36
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,002
- Now, will you please...
- Hey, Chance!

37
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:08,672
What do you want to do about this outfit?
Do you want to take their guns?

38
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,340
Got any new men with you, Pat?

39
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:12,759
No, nobody except Colorado here.

40
00:08:13,468 --> 00:08:15,470
- Where'd you take him on?
- Fort Worth.

41
00:08:15,554 --> 00:08:18,223
- What does he do?
- I speak English, Sheriff...

42
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:20,225
...if you want to ask me.

43
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,856
All right, buster, what do you do?

44
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,317
I'm riding guard.

45
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,402
Pretty young for that, aren't you?

46
00:08:30,485 --> 00:08:32,988
Just how old do you have to be, Sheriff?

47
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,866
You remember Ryan from Denver,
don't you?

48
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,159
Rocky Ryan?

49
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:38,827
That's his boy.

50
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,580
He tells me the kid's faster than he was.

51
00:08:41,705 --> 00:08:44,750
He better be, packing a pair of guns.

52
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:49,713
Now, Sheriff, if it's the two guns that
bother you, I could give you one of them.

53
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:51,590
I could let you have them both.

54
00:08:51,673 --> 00:08:53,800
They wouldn't do me too much good.

55
00:08:53,884 --> 00:08:56,845
That fellow in the door there
has a shotgun on me.

56
00:08:57,054 --> 00:09:00,724
- Stumpy, didn't I tell...
- I know. I'm going. I'm going.

57
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:06,355
You can keep your guns, Colorado.

58
00:09:06,438 --> 00:09:09,274
Thanks, Sheriff. I don't want any trouble.

59
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:11,151
Well, then don't start any.

60
00:09:11,234 --> 00:09:13,654
I won't, unless I tell you first.

61
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:15,572
That's good enough.

62
00:09:15,697 --> 00:09:18,325
Pat, you can put your wagons
in that corral.

63
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,077
I ought to do just that.

64
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,746
- What?
- I'm just guessing, you understand.

65
00:09:23,121 --> 00:09:25,916
It seems to me that you've already got
some trouble here.

66
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,334
You're guessing right.

67
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:31,338
It so happens that part of our load
there is fuel oil and dynamite.

68
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:33,882
Would you like to have that
sitting next to you?

69
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:35,258
No, I wouldn't.

70
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,719
They could put them over there
by the creek.

71
00:09:37,803 --> 00:09:39,721
Near the Burdette warehouse.

72
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:42,891
If it's going to blow
that's just as good a place as any.

73
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,643
Show them the way, Dude.

74
00:09:44,726 --> 00:09:46,561
You can go along, Colorado.

75
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:49,231
Is that the way you want it, Mr. Wheeler?

76
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:52,442
Go ahead.

77
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:11,295
Let's get out of the middle of the street.

78
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:17,843
Now that you're satisfied
and that the kid's got his guns...

79
00:10:18,593 --> 00:10:21,763
...would you mind telling me
what this is all about?

80
00:10:22,764 --> 00:10:24,850
We've got Joe Burdette in here.

81
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:29,563
- Joe Burdette in jail? Nathan's brother?
- That's right.

82
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,107
What are you holding them for?

83
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,444
They were about to bury the reason
when you were coming in.

84
00:10:35,611 --> 00:10:38,071
- Murder?
- No other word for it.

85
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:41,074
No wonder this town's in such a mess.

86
00:10:41,658 --> 00:10:43,327
What does Nathan say about this?

87
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,663
Nothing. He's not talking. Just doing.

88
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:48,081
You saw part of it.

89
00:10:48,165 --> 00:10:53,420
He's got this town so bottled up
that I can't get Joe out or any help in.

90
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:57,549
There are men over there watching us.

91
00:10:57,674 --> 00:10:59,092
They're his.

92
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:02,220
I can't make a move
without him knowing it.

93
00:11:02,304 --> 00:11:04,014
Who you got helping you?

94
00:11:05,182 --> 00:11:06,975
You met half of them.

95
00:11:07,225 --> 00:11:11,021
You mean that fellow with the badge
that stopped me, and who else?

96
00:11:11,355 --> 00:11:13,690
Stumpy. You know him.

97
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,735
He's watching Joe and guarding the jail.

98
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:21,198
A game-legged old man and a drunk.
That's all you got?

99
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:22,950
That's what I got.

100
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:28,205
If I ever saw a man holding the bull
by the tail, you're it.

101
00:11:29,831 --> 00:11:32,376
It's a good idea putting my wagons
where they're safe.

102
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,503
Guess I better see they did it.

103
00:11:34,586 --> 00:11:36,129
I'll see you later.

104
00:11:49,226 --> 00:11:51,520
Better get back up there
and watch the road.

105
00:11:51,603 --> 00:11:53,188
You don't look so good.

106
00:11:53,397 --> 00:11:54,856
I feel worse.

107
00:11:55,232 --> 00:11:57,067
Think I'll stop off and get a beer.

108
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,694
I thought you would.

109
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:01,363
Got some in here. Cold.

110
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:03,490
Just as long as it's beer.

111
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:12,499
Stumpy, didn't I tell you
to stay out of sight?

112
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:16,795
There you go. I never can please you.
I was just covering you in case of trouble.

113
00:12:16,878 --> 00:12:21,258
I'd be in more trouble if you'd have gotten
picked off while standing at that door.

114
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:22,592
You'd be in trouble?

115
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:24,761
What about me
if somebody gunned me down?

116
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,763
Don't you never think of me?

117
00:12:27,222 --> 00:12:29,641
Dude, I guess we better get used to it.

118
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,811
Here's a fellow don't think of nobody
but himself.

119
00:12:32,936 --> 00:12:35,188
I told you why I want you back in there...

120
00:12:35,272 --> 00:12:38,775
...and you're going to stay there
with that cage locked when I'm not here.

121
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,444
- You hear me?
- I heard you.

122
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,195
Those windows, did you fix them?

123
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:44,615
Them shutters is nailed up
tighter than a drum.

124
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:46,241
Nothing could get in here.

125
00:12:46,325 --> 00:12:48,869
- Not even some fresh air.
- That's the way I want it.

126
00:12:48,952 --> 00:12:51,246
You can help to change my life.
Can't help it.

127
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:55,792
Five, six days breathing the same air
as Burdette might make a killer out of me.

128
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:58,253
You can hear me back there,
can't you, Joe?

129
00:12:58,337 --> 00:13:01,632
I hear you all right, but I won't have
to listen to you for very long.

130
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:04,051
Now, Joe, that's gratitude for you.

131
00:13:04,176 --> 00:13:07,220
After me fixing up all your cuts
and bruises like I done.

132
00:13:07,304 --> 00:13:09,848
I hope it happens again.
I won't do it, that's all.

133
00:13:09,931 --> 00:13:11,642
- Shut up!
- I take it back, Joe.

134
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:14,811
If it does happen again,
I'll do just like I done before...

135
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:18,065
...only I hope you have
more cuts and bruises to fix.

136
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:21,568
Hey, Dude. Dude, come here a minute.

137
00:13:22,486 --> 00:13:23,946
What do you want?

138
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:26,907
Why don't you sit in here
in place of Stumpy?

139
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,993
I'd rather listen to a drunk than him.

140
00:13:31,161 --> 00:13:33,205
How you holding up, borrachón?

141
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:35,248
Got the shakes yet?

142
00:13:35,707 --> 00:13:40,003
That beer won't do you no good. You'll
have to get something stronger than that.

143
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:43,173
If you're still broke,
I think I got another dollar.

144
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:48,428
- Chance, you going to let him do that?
- I'll do better than that.

145
00:13:48,512 --> 00:13:51,890
I'll let him have the key to your cell
anytime he wants it.

146
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:59,147
It'd be too easy.
He's got nobody to back him up.

147
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:03,193
If he talks out of turn,
throw a bucket of water on him.

148
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:06,571
I'll throw one in the middle of his bed
and leave him to sleep in it.

149
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:08,115
Want another beer?

150
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,659
You kind of wasted some of that last one.

151
00:14:10,742 --> 00:14:13,245
No, it wasn't wasted, except I missed him.

152
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,707
- I don't need any more.
- Hey, in the jail.

153
00:14:21,044 --> 00:14:23,380
That's far enough. What do you want?

154
00:14:23,547 --> 00:14:26,591
Mr. Wheeler said to bring this package
to the Sheriff.

155
00:14:26,883 --> 00:14:30,220
- You expecting a package?
- Be right out.

156
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:32,848
- Stumpy?
- Yeah?

157
00:14:32,931 --> 00:14:35,309
Going over to the hotel for a few minutes.

158
00:14:35,392 --> 00:14:38,687
If you don't come back,
me and Joe will have us a good cry.

159
00:14:38,895 --> 00:14:40,772
Just keep that door locked.

160
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,735
- Thanks for your trouble.
- No trouble at all.

161
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:47,195
Wheeler says just be careful coming up.

162
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,116
Looks like our friend's still on the job.

163
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,451
Yeah.

164
00:14:53,076 --> 00:14:55,495
There's another one over by the church.

165
00:14:56,371 --> 00:14:58,165
Any use in arresting them?

166
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:00,709
For just standing around?

167
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,961
All they'd do is get another one.

168
00:15:03,253 --> 00:15:05,547
The jail isn't big enough
to hold all of them.

169
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:09,676
As a matter of fact,
they'd like to get a few in jail.

170
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:11,303
Remember that.

171
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:18,977
Señor Chance. I've been looking for you.
I have a message for...

172
00:15:19,061 --> 00:15:22,314
- What you have here?
- The package you've been waiting for.

173
00:15:22,397 --> 00:15:24,524
Just in time.

174
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:27,945
- Carlos! Where you are?
- I'm over here.

175
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:29,780
You keep it. Consuelo, she comes now.

176
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:32,449
If you break the dishes,
you'll see what happens.

177
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:35,744
Every day is the same thing... Carlos.
Oh Señor Chance.

178
00:15:35,953 --> 00:15:37,871
I just ask Carlos if he's...

179
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:40,415
Carlos, what is wrong?

180
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,669
You look like the cat
who swallows the chicken.

181
00:15:43,752 --> 00:15:46,922
- What have you been doing?
- What have I been doing?

182
00:15:47,005 --> 00:15:50,550
I've been talking to my friend the sheriff,
that's what I have been doing.

183
00:15:50,634 --> 00:15:52,135
We have important business.

184
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:54,471
You say I look like the cat
who eats too much.

185
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,348
Consuelo, look at me.

186
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:57,557
Am I fat?

187
00:15:57,641 --> 00:16:00,686
- I did not say you are fat.
- Please, Consuelo, do not say more.

188
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:02,479
You already say too much.

189
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,982
Me and my friend
will make our business alone.

190
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:06,233
Come.

191
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:14,866
The thing is if he ate the chicken or not.

192
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:16,535
I'm going to see.

193
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:19,037
You take chances, my friend.

194
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:20,497
Because I know woman.

195
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,833
If she will be mad or she will be sorry.

196
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,544
If it is mad,
she will be much pleasure to make right.

197
00:16:25,627 --> 00:16:28,255
And if she is sorry,
it will be the same pleasure.

198
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:30,215
You do not have women.

199
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:31,842
So you do not know.

200
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:34,803
But me, Carlos Remonte, I know.

201
00:16:35,971 --> 00:16:38,640
Wait till I show you
what is in this package.

202
00:16:40,225 --> 00:16:42,853
Then you tell me
if I do not know about women.

203
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:47,899
If I had bought these myself,
everyone in town would have known.

204
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:53,488
And it's not the sort of thing that Consuelo
would like to have known by everyone.

205
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,161
You see?

206
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:02,706
Are they not beautiful?

207
00:17:03,332 --> 00:17:05,876
Can you make the picture
how she will look?

208
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:07,878
You sure you want me to do that?

209
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:09,129
No.

210
00:17:09,546 --> 00:17:12,174
Do not make the picture.
It is best for me to do it.

211
00:17:12,257 --> 00:17:15,302
I beg your pardon, gentlemen,
but I'm looking for a...

212
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,140
Those things have great possibilities,
but not for you.

213
00:17:23,101 --> 00:17:24,811
What are you doing here?

214
00:17:25,646 --> 00:17:29,733
Until I saw those things, I was looking
for a towel. I'd like to take a bath.

215
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:32,402
- Didn't you come in on the stage?
- That's right.

216
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:34,071
Why aren't you on it?

217
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:37,199
Whoever heard of a stagecoach
having a bathroom?

218
00:17:37,282 --> 00:17:40,369
Chihuahua, I forgot.
I start to tell you and I forgot.

219
00:17:40,452 --> 00:17:42,245
The stage, she did not go.

220
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:43,538
Why?

221
00:17:43,622 --> 00:17:46,083
- Something happened with the wheel.
- Where's Jake?

222
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,044
Near the corral.
He must fix the wheel before he can leave.

223
00:17:49,127 --> 00:17:50,545
That's just fine.

224
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:55,926
Hey, Sheriff, you forgot your pants.

225
00:18:47,853 --> 00:18:50,105
You reckon they'll try anything tonight?

226
00:18:50,188 --> 00:18:53,525
Could be. Nathan Burdette's smart.
Don't underrate him.

227
00:18:53,609 --> 00:18:55,360
That ain't no kind of answer.

228
00:18:55,444 --> 00:18:57,946
How or what he'll do, I don't know.

229
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:00,490
Your guess is as good as mine.

230
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:02,576
What I want to know is when.

231
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,454
I wish he'd hurry up and do it.

232
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,342
Have a bottle of beer, Dude?

233
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:20,260
I'm full of beer.

234
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:23,180
It doesn't do any good.

235
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,475
It'll start working on you tomorrow
or the next day.

236
00:19:32,022 --> 00:19:33,023
Stumpy.

237
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:36,735
We're going to take a turn
around the town.

238
00:19:37,778 --> 00:19:40,072
- You be all right?
- 'Course I'll be all right.

239
00:19:40,155 --> 00:19:41,990
Then get in there where you belong.

240
00:19:42,074 --> 00:19:44,701
I'm going. But you remember one thing:

241
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:48,372
When you come back,
you holler before you open that door.

242
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:50,958
I'm liable to blast you
just for the heck of it.

243
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,292
We'll holler.

244
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,678
You got any particular reason
for going out tonight?

245
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:03,971
Usually do.

246
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:08,016
Don't want to do anything different,
they might think we're scared.

247
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:09,643
Aren't we?

248
00:20:11,436 --> 00:20:13,897
I just can't take it sitting in there.

249
00:20:14,022 --> 00:20:16,275
You mean you saw I couldn't take it.

250
00:20:16,817 --> 00:20:19,403
Don't set yourself up as being so special.

251
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:22,155
Think you invented the hangover.

252
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:25,284
I could sure take out a patent for this one.

253
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:30,163
Take that side.

254
00:21:06,408 --> 00:21:07,659
Good evening.

255
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,947
Hold it, Dude. Stairway.

256
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:29,074
Don't shoot, Sheriff.

257
00:22:29,199 --> 00:22:31,034
Just getting a little air.

258
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,695
I'm getting jumpy.

259
00:23:06,778 --> 00:23:09,364
I'll walk along with you
and hold your hand.

260
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:12,409
- Get back over there where you belong.
- Yes, Papa.

261
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:29,384
- Carlos.
- Señor Chance. I been looking for you.

262
00:23:29,468 --> 00:23:31,595
- It is very bad.
- What's wrong?

263
00:23:31,678 --> 00:23:33,847
- Your friend Señor Wheeler.
- What about him?

264
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:37,768
He is a good friend
and he wishes good for you, so he talks.

265
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:40,354
He talks to people. He talk to everybody.

266
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:43,774
He say why they don't help you,
that you should have some more help.

267
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:45,567
He's right.

268
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:48,362
But is no good to say such things
to the wrong people.

269
00:23:48,445 --> 00:23:50,322
- You tell him.
- Is he in there?

270
00:23:50,405 --> 00:23:51,615
Si, I think.

271
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:55,535
Chance, he's over there.

272
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,913
The kings full.

273
00:23:58,121 --> 00:23:59,998
That's good. Beats me.

274
00:24:08,382 --> 00:24:10,175
Spare a minute, Pat?

275
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,677
Good evening, Sheriff.

276
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,928
Deal me out.

277
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:14,096
Evening.

278
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:26,316
You two know each other.

279
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:27,484
Yeah.

280
00:24:27,734 --> 00:24:29,278
No thanks, Carlos.

281
00:24:29,778 --> 00:24:31,697
I've been wanting to talk to you.

282
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,573
You've been talking too much.

283
00:24:33,657 --> 00:24:36,368
- What do you mean "talking too much"?
- Anybody that...

284
00:24:36,451 --> 00:24:40,998
...sides in with me right now's liable to find
themselves up to their ears in trouble.

285
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:44,084
Is that why you haven't asked for
any deputies?

286
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:47,963
Give me a new deck of cards.
I'm not having any luck with this one.

287
00:24:48,505 --> 00:24:51,633
I was talking about why you haven't
asked for any new deputies.

288
00:24:51,717 --> 00:24:52,968
You could get some.

289
00:24:53,051 --> 00:24:55,095
How about my drivers?
You could use them.

290
00:24:55,178 --> 00:24:57,514
Suppose I got them, what would I have?

291
00:24:57,639 --> 00:24:59,516
Some well-meaning amateurs.

292
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,436
Most of them worried
about their wives and kids.

293
00:25:03,186 --> 00:25:06,106
Burdette has 30 or 40 men,
all professionals.

294
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:09,860
Only things they're worried
about is earning their pay.

295
00:25:10,652 --> 00:25:15,198
No, Pat, all I'd be doing is giving them
more targets to shoot at.

296
00:25:15,574 --> 00:25:17,618
A lot of people would get hurt.

297
00:25:18,035 --> 00:25:19,578
Joe Burdette isn't worth it.

298
00:25:19,661 --> 00:25:22,289
He isn't worth one of those
that would get killed.

299
00:25:22,372 --> 00:25:24,124
Then what are you going to do?

300
00:25:24,207 --> 00:25:27,210
All you got for help is that old man
down at the jail and this...

301
00:25:27,294 --> 00:25:29,755
Borrachón is the name,
Mr. Wheeler.

302
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,050
I'll go outside so you can talk more freely.

303
00:25:37,638 --> 00:25:39,097
Wasn't good, Pat.

304
00:25:39,514 --> 00:25:41,058
Let's sit down.

305
00:25:41,224 --> 00:25:42,684
Yeah, I know.

306
00:25:43,393 --> 00:25:44,770
I shouldn't have said it.

307
00:25:44,853 --> 00:25:46,772
I meant nothing by it.

308
00:25:47,147 --> 00:25:49,816
But I'm so used to stumbling
over that fellow.

309
00:25:49,942 --> 00:25:52,778
I don't think I ever saw him
standing on his own two feet...

310
00:25:52,861 --> 00:25:54,905
...without something to hold him up.

311
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:56,782
How long you been coming here?

312
00:25:56,865 --> 00:25:58,367
Going on two years.

313
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:02,245
If you'd have come through three years
ago, you wouldn't have stumbled over him.

314
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:03,830
Dude was good.

315
00:26:04,164 --> 00:26:05,374
He was my deputy.

316
00:26:05,457 --> 00:26:07,668
Best man with a gun I ever worked with.

317
00:26:07,751 --> 00:26:10,045
That's pretty hard to believe, Chance.

318
00:26:11,213 --> 00:26:14,508
A girl. Just a girl
that came through on the stage.

319
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:17,594
She was no good,
but couldn't tell him that.

320
00:26:17,678 --> 00:26:19,972
I tried and he damn near killed me.

321
00:26:21,264 --> 00:26:22,891
Anyway, he was hooked.

322
00:26:23,225 --> 00:26:24,434
Went away with her.

323
00:26:24,518 --> 00:26:27,104
Six months later
he came back without her.

324
00:26:27,187 --> 00:26:30,565
That's when the Mexicans
started calling him borrachón.

325
00:26:30,691 --> 00:26:32,693
- That's Spanish for...
- I know.

326
00:26:33,193 --> 00:26:34,361
He told me.

327
00:26:35,195 --> 00:26:38,156
So, for two years he's been drinking...

328
00:26:38,532 --> 00:26:43,787
...all he could buy, or somebody would buy
for him until last night.

329
00:26:44,621 --> 00:26:46,707
And how long do you think that'll last?

330
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,041
I don't know.

331
00:26:48,792 --> 00:26:51,837
So in the meantime,
you have to take care of him.

332
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,923
He's been doing a pretty good job
of taking care of me.

333
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,052
I'm supposed to be your friend, too.

334
00:26:59,761 --> 00:27:02,806
- Why don't you let me help you?
- You're not good enough.

335
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:04,558
I don't know! I'm as good...

336
00:27:04,641 --> 00:27:07,936
If you're so good,
why did you have to hire Colorado?

337
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,813
No thanks, you keep out of it.

338
00:27:09,896 --> 00:27:10,981
That's an idea.

339
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:13,817
- What?
- Ryan. "Colorado," you call him.

340
00:27:14,151 --> 00:27:16,862
He's young, Chance, but he's good.
Real good.

341
00:27:17,404 --> 00:27:20,532
I could use him if he's good.
But that's up to him.

342
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:22,951
We'll see what he says.

343
00:27:42,763 --> 00:27:44,222
Good evening, Sheriff.

344
00:27:44,348 --> 00:27:45,724
Any luck, kid?

345
00:27:46,141 --> 00:27:48,644
- It's a pretty fast game.
- Son, I...

346
00:27:48,936 --> 00:27:52,189
...asked you over here
because the Sheriff's a friend of mine.

347
00:27:52,272 --> 00:27:55,067
He's got trouble. He can use a good man.

348
00:27:55,734 --> 00:27:57,694
To go against the Burdettes, Sheriff?

349
00:27:57,778 --> 00:27:59,071
That's right.

350
00:27:59,321 --> 00:28:01,573
I told him you were one of the best.

351
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:08,664
I'll tell you what I'm a lot better at,
Mr. Wheeler.

352
00:28:08,747 --> 00:28:10,791
That's minding my own business.

353
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:12,918
No offense, Sheriff.

354
00:28:13,794 --> 00:28:14,962
No offense.

355
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:22,970
I never expected that.

356
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:24,972
He showed good sense.

357
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,724
- I'd like to have him.
- I don't see why you...

358
00:28:27,808 --> 00:28:29,935
Quit stewing, Pat. You tried.

359
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:31,561
I appreciate it.

360
00:28:31,812 --> 00:28:34,231
If you don't want me,
I'll round up my men...

361
00:28:34,314 --> 00:28:38,360
...and get set for an early start
in the morning. See you before I go.

362
00:28:42,572 --> 00:28:43,991
Enough for me for a while.

363
00:28:44,074 --> 00:28:45,367
You leaving?

364
00:28:45,492 --> 00:28:48,453
- Maybe I'll have some luck now.
- Maybe.

365
00:28:48,537 --> 00:28:50,539
If you play your cards right.

366
00:28:50,664 --> 00:28:52,916
Hope you leave some of your luck with me.

367
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,502
I'll come back and give it to you next time.

368
00:28:55,585 --> 00:28:57,087
We'll ante up.

369
00:28:59,464 --> 00:29:00,382
Dude?

370
00:29:00,507 --> 00:29:01,425
Yeah?

371
00:29:02,342 --> 00:29:04,553
I'll be out in a couple of minutes.

372
00:29:25,115 --> 00:29:26,533
Hi, Sheriff.

373
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:29,786
I'm sorry about those pants.

374
00:29:30,203 --> 00:29:31,997
Carlos told me they weren't yours.

375
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,000
You're in trouble, lady.
I'd like to talk to you.

376
00:29:36,418 --> 00:29:37,544
Sure.

377
00:29:42,716 --> 00:29:44,509
Well, Sheriff, what is it?

378
00:29:45,135 --> 00:29:48,722
I was looking through the deck of cards
you people were using.

379
00:29:49,556 --> 00:29:51,224
Three cards short.

380
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,769
Pretty obvious ones, aces.

381
00:29:55,854 --> 00:29:57,356
Why do you tell me?

382
00:29:57,648 --> 00:30:01,985
I know everyone in that game except you
and the fellow in the checkered vest.

383
00:30:02,194 --> 00:30:04,613
- And did you talk to him?
- He's still there.

384
00:30:04,696 --> 00:30:06,031
You were leaving.

385
00:30:06,156 --> 00:30:07,908
And I was a winner.

386
00:30:09,493 --> 00:30:11,620
Is that all you've got to go on?

387
00:30:12,371 --> 00:30:15,791
No. Here's a handbill...

388
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,587
...about a gambler they're interested in
catching up with.

389
00:30:20,796 --> 00:30:22,297
You know him?

390
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:24,716
Says he had a girl with him.

391
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:29,846
Says the girl's about 22,
5 foot 5 inches tall...

392
00:30:30,472 --> 00:30:34,643
...good figure, brown hair,
and wears feathers.

393
00:30:37,104 --> 00:30:40,148
Now, the man isn't our...

394
00:30:40,232 --> 00:30:43,777
...friend in the checkered vest
but you could be the girl.

395
00:30:44,444 --> 00:30:46,280
Yes, I could be.

396
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:50,033
As a matter of fact, I am.

397
00:30:53,036 --> 00:30:55,622
Make sure you're on the stage
in the morning.

398
00:30:55,706 --> 00:31:00,627
You'd better give me the money you won,
I'll see that it gets back to the right people.

399
00:31:01,503 --> 00:31:03,338
It's pretty easy, isn't it?

400
00:31:03,797 --> 00:31:07,884
Just give you the money
and get on the stage.

401
00:31:09,803 --> 00:31:12,014
But I'm not going to make it that easy.

402
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:15,976
You've made me mad, Sheriff.
You didn't ask me if I took those cards.

403
00:31:16,101 --> 00:31:18,437
So, you're going to have to prove
I've got them.

404
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,064
The only way I know you can do that
is to search me.

405
00:31:21,148 --> 00:31:22,899
- Search you?
- That's right.

406
00:31:23,025 --> 00:31:25,944
Isn't that what a sheriff usually does
to a prisoner?

407
00:31:26,028 --> 00:31:29,615
Let's see, the cards could be in my purse...

408
00:31:29,698 --> 00:31:31,366
...but they're not.

409
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,911
They could be in my shoes,
my stockings, garters.

410
00:31:34,995 --> 00:31:38,248
- All right, all right.
- I don't wear anything like those red pants.

411
00:31:38,332 --> 00:31:41,418
And my sleeves are too tight,
but there's my waist.

412
00:31:42,002 --> 00:31:44,588
You've got a job to do,
where do you intend to begin?

413
00:31:44,671 --> 00:31:47,633
- That's about enough.
- You have to prove I've got those cards.

414
00:31:47,716 --> 00:31:50,844
- You keep going, and I'm apt to do it!
- I'm not so sure.

415
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:53,972
I think you're embarrassed.

416
00:31:54,056 --> 00:31:56,266
- And if you're not...
- If he's not...

417
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,434
...he ought to be.

418
00:31:57,517 --> 00:31:59,311
What're you doing here?

419
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,521
I don't think she has the cards.

420
00:32:01,605 --> 00:32:03,815
If that's what you're looking for.

421
00:32:04,483 --> 00:32:05,984
How do you know?

422
00:32:06,068 --> 00:32:08,403
The fellow in the checkered vest has them.

423
00:32:08,487 --> 00:32:10,197
Why didn't you find out?

424
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,033
I said I wouldn't start anything
till I told you first.

425
00:32:13,116 --> 00:32:15,577
I'm telling you.
I'm going to see if he's got them.

426
00:32:15,661 --> 00:32:17,162
Wait a minute.

427
00:32:18,205 --> 00:32:20,457
- You want to come along?
- I do.

428
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:22,334
I'm interested, too.

429
00:32:42,187 --> 00:32:43,647
Ace high straight.

430
00:32:44,064 --> 00:32:46,233
Looks like I got the lady's luck.

431
00:32:47,401 --> 00:32:49,528
All right, keep your hands on the table.

432
00:32:49,611 --> 00:32:51,238
Right where they are.

433
00:32:53,031 --> 00:32:54,783
Put your hands back.

434
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,326
Where they were.

435
00:33:10,132 --> 00:33:11,425
Holdout.

436
00:33:12,301 --> 00:33:14,011
He's all yours, Sheriff.

437
00:33:14,344 --> 00:33:15,387
Get up.

438
00:33:16,763 --> 00:33:17,848
Get up!

439
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:22,269
We don't like tinhorns around here, mister.

440
00:33:22,603 --> 00:33:24,813
Carlos, lock him in his room.

441
00:33:25,272 --> 00:33:27,441
Let him out in time for the stage.

442
00:33:27,774 --> 00:33:30,819
You losers can help yourself
to what's on the table.

443
00:33:31,445 --> 00:33:32,613
Thanks, Colorado.

444
00:33:32,696 --> 00:33:35,532
Sheriff, aren't you forgetting something?

445
00:33:45,834 --> 00:33:49,713
I guess I was wrong about you
having those cards.

446
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:52,215
Is that all, Sheriff?

447
00:33:52,424 --> 00:33:55,552
I'm not going to apologize,
if that's what you mean.

448
00:33:55,844 --> 00:33:58,513
We haven't gotten past that handbill,
have we?

449
00:33:58,639 --> 00:33:59,890
That's right.

450
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,143
You haven't done anything
to make me think we will.

451
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:06,813
Idea of being searched
didn't bother you much.

452
00:34:07,105 --> 00:34:08,190
Made a joke of it.

453
00:34:08,273 --> 00:34:10,901
Instead of me being embarrassed,
you were.

454
00:34:11,068 --> 00:34:14,321
Tell me, Sheriff, what should I have done?

455
00:34:14,988 --> 00:34:16,448
I'd like to know.

456
00:34:16,823 --> 00:34:19,785
This isn't the first time
that handbill has come up.

457
00:34:19,868 --> 00:34:22,204
I'd like to know what to do about it.

458
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:25,874
You could quit playing cards...

459
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:28,168
...wearing feathers.

460
00:34:28,251 --> 00:34:29,670
No, Sheriff.

461
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,256
No, I'm not going to do that.

462
00:34:34,299 --> 00:34:37,636
You see, that's what I'd do...

463
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,599
...if I were the kind of girl
that you think I am.

464
00:35:02,536 --> 00:35:04,121
Dude, you seen Wheeler?

465
00:35:04,204 --> 00:35:06,164
Not since he went up the street.

466
00:35:06,248 --> 00:35:08,250
I think that's him coming now.

467
00:35:21,888 --> 00:35:23,432
Get him out of here.

468
00:35:29,271 --> 00:35:32,190
Watch the stable.
That's where the shot came from.

469
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,403
Got him in the back.

470
00:35:36,987 --> 00:35:38,155
He's dead.

471
00:35:40,741 --> 00:35:44,661
Didn't take them long,
less than an hour after he offered to help.

472
00:35:46,121 --> 00:35:48,290
Ain't got many friends like that.

473
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:51,418
You were smart, Colorado.

474
00:35:51,501 --> 00:35:54,671
- No one's come out of the stable.
- I want to go with you.

475
00:35:54,755 --> 00:35:57,507
Want to help get the man
that killed your boss?

476
00:35:57,758 --> 00:36:00,510
- Wouldn't you?
- I wouldn't have let him get shot.

477
00:36:00,594 --> 00:36:03,263
You had a chance to get in this
and you didn't want it.

478
00:36:03,347 --> 00:36:05,349
Stay out, we don't need you.

479
00:36:05,432 --> 00:36:08,644
If you want to do something,
get him out of the street.

480
00:36:12,773 --> 00:36:16,026
Get around to the side
where you can see front and back.

481
00:36:16,401 --> 00:36:17,653
How you going in?

482
00:36:17,736 --> 00:36:21,073
Right through the door.
If he comes out, you can have him.

483
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:23,951
There's no sense in me
telling you to cool down.

484
00:36:24,034 --> 00:36:25,410
No, there isn't.

485
00:36:25,494 --> 00:36:26,620
I thought so.

486
00:36:26,703 --> 00:36:28,914
I'll let you know when I get there.

487
00:37:33,687 --> 00:37:35,314
Chance, you all right?

488
00:37:52,122 --> 00:37:53,749
Chance, out here.

489
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:56,084
You all right?

490
00:37:56,168 --> 00:37:58,211
Just dirt in my eyes. Did you get him?

491
00:37:58,295 --> 00:38:00,255
He came out the door, running fast.

492
00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:02,549
- You missed him.
- I couldn't get a good shot.

493
00:38:02,633 --> 00:38:06,136
- Might've winged him.
- Don't worry. It's my fault we lost him.

494
00:38:06,219 --> 00:38:07,638
He hasn't got away yet...

495
00:38:07,721 --> 00:38:10,515
...or I wouldn't be standing here.
He went in the saloon.

496
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:12,976
- He's still in there.
- How do you know?

497
00:38:13,143 --> 00:38:15,062
Can see both doors from here.

498
00:38:15,145 --> 00:38:16,980
And there ain't any others.

499
00:38:17,439 --> 00:38:19,191
I'm an expert on saloons.

500
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,486
- Get a chance to see who he was?
- No, but we'll know.

501
00:38:22,569 --> 00:38:26,573
He'll have muddy boots.
He stepped in that puddle by the trough.

502
00:38:27,366 --> 00:38:29,660
You figure we're going in there after him?

503
00:38:29,743 --> 00:38:31,453
- Aren't we?
- We used to.

504
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:34,957
There's eight or ten Burdette men in there.

505
00:38:35,832 --> 00:38:37,209
Maybe more.

506
00:38:38,585 --> 00:38:41,380
You take the back door, I'll go in the front.

507
00:38:41,505 --> 00:38:42,673
I'd like to try...

508
00:38:42,756 --> 00:38:44,508
You'd like to try what?

509
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:47,761
I been going in the back door.

510
00:38:48,011 --> 00:38:50,597
They haven't been letting me in the front.

511
00:38:51,932 --> 00:38:53,767
Think you're good enough?

512
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:55,435
I'd like to find out.

513
00:38:55,602 --> 00:38:56,937
So would I.

514
00:38:57,729 --> 00:39:00,274
I'll let you know when I get around back.

515
00:40:02,711 --> 00:40:04,463
Begin with you, Charlie.

516
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:07,382
That shotgun you keep under the bar.

517
00:40:08,342 --> 00:40:10,135
Pick it up by the barrel.

518
00:40:10,844 --> 00:40:11,887
Easy.

519
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:15,766
Thought you were going to ask for a drink.
It's been a long dry spell.

520
00:40:15,891 --> 00:40:17,184
Shotgun first.

521
00:40:17,976 --> 00:40:19,144
Set it down.

522
00:40:20,562 --> 00:40:21,813
Back up.

523
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,905
Jim, Pedro, get over there.

524
00:40:37,329 --> 00:40:41,291
All right, the rest of you,
I'm not going to tell you twice.

525
00:40:42,084 --> 00:40:45,379
You're going to stand up
and stand real still.

526
00:40:46,338 --> 00:40:47,339
Now!

527
00:40:51,927 --> 00:40:56,848
All right, now one by one,
start with you, unbuckle your guns...

528
00:40:57,099 --> 00:40:58,934
...drop them and step back.

529
00:41:01,645 --> 00:41:02,646
Come on.

530
00:41:09,778 --> 00:41:12,489
There's no reason for you to move, Charlie.

531
00:41:16,326 --> 00:41:17,661
What's this all about?

532
00:41:17,786 --> 00:41:20,330
We're looking for a man that ran in here.

533
00:41:20,455 --> 00:41:22,040
Nobody's run in here.

534
00:41:22,124 --> 00:41:24,334
We'll remember you said that.

535
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:29,047
Man we're looking for has muddy boots.

536
00:41:29,756 --> 00:41:32,009
Now, one by one, hold up your feet.

537
00:41:47,733 --> 00:41:49,776
Who saw a man run in here?

538
00:41:50,944 --> 00:41:51,987
I did.

539
00:41:53,322 --> 00:41:56,033
Almost forgot about you, Charlie.
Come on out.

540
00:41:57,743 --> 00:41:59,453
Clean as a whistle.

541
00:41:59,995 --> 00:42:02,205
Dude, you been seeing things again.

542
00:42:02,289 --> 00:42:03,999
You better have a drink.

543
00:42:06,209 --> 00:42:07,210
Dude.

544
00:42:08,795 --> 00:42:10,297
Maybe this'll help.

545
00:42:52,381 --> 00:42:54,967
Guess I'll take that drink now, Charlie.

546
00:42:55,425 --> 00:42:57,219
Kind of thought you would.

547
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:06,853
You want that gun, pick it up.

548
00:43:08,313 --> 00:43:09,773
I wish you would.

549
00:43:15,028 --> 00:43:17,072
Stepped in a puddle all right.

550
00:43:17,864 --> 00:43:19,658
It's the fellow we wanted.

551
00:43:22,035 --> 00:43:23,578
I guess this is his.

552
00:43:23,662 --> 00:43:25,956
A nice, fresh $50 gold piece.

553
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:30,627
It's just about what Burdette would figure
a man's life was worth.

554
00:43:31,169 --> 00:43:33,338
That's earning money the hard way.

555
00:43:36,883 --> 00:43:38,260
Paid killer.

556
00:43:39,511 --> 00:43:42,556
Nice, fresh $50 gold piece.

557
00:43:44,474 --> 00:43:46,977
You, mister, you got one in your pocket?

558
00:43:47,185 --> 00:43:48,604
Nobody paid me.

559
00:43:48,937 --> 00:43:50,147
Nobody!

560
00:43:50,647 --> 00:43:53,191
And nobody run in here, either, huh?

561
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:55,235
Chance.

562
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:57,279
I'm not going to hurt him.

563
00:43:57,487 --> 00:43:58,488
Get up!

564
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,742
You're all in it.

565
00:44:02,743 --> 00:44:04,328
The whole lot of you.

566
00:44:05,454 --> 00:44:07,539
You're going to get out of town.

567
00:44:07,914 --> 00:44:09,875
Take your boy here with you.

568
00:44:11,126 --> 00:44:13,545
You can tell Burdette you got Wheeler.

569
00:44:14,338 --> 00:44:17,758
You can tell anybody else he sends,
he'd better pay them more...

570
00:44:17,841 --> 00:44:20,135
...because they're going to earn it.

571
00:44:21,345 --> 00:44:23,305
Charlie, I want you to...

572
00:44:26,224 --> 00:44:27,976
You finished yet, Dude?

573
00:44:28,477 --> 00:44:29,603
You in a hurry?

574
00:44:29,686 --> 00:44:30,979
Not especially.

575
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:44,576
You threw the silver dollar, didn't you?

576
00:44:44,701 --> 00:44:46,870
- Yeah, Dude, l...
- You want it back?

577
00:44:47,788 --> 00:44:49,790
- Sure.
- You know how to get it?

578
00:44:52,292 --> 00:44:53,251
Yeah.

579
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:12,104
That's all for me, Chance.

580
00:45:12,729 --> 00:45:15,232
- Charlie, come here.
- Yeah, Sheriff.

581
00:45:15,315 --> 00:45:16,692
You're going with us.

582
00:45:16,775 --> 00:45:18,694
Why pick on me? Why choose me?

583
00:45:18,777 --> 00:45:21,530
You're carrying these guns
down to the jail for us.

584
00:45:21,613 --> 00:45:23,991
All right, back up and give him room.

585
00:45:27,869 --> 00:45:30,455
I guess they'll let you
in the front door from now on.

586
00:45:37,462 --> 00:45:41,008
You mean to tell me you followed him
into Burdette's saloon?

587
00:45:41,508 --> 00:45:43,093
Why, you're crazy!

588
00:45:43,176 --> 00:45:45,512
And you are, too. What happened?

589
00:45:46,138 --> 00:45:47,597
He was hiding in the loft.

590
00:45:47,681 --> 00:45:48,765
Who got him?

591
00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:50,559
Dude did. One shot.

592
00:45:51,768 --> 00:45:53,520
I wish I could've seen that.

593
00:45:53,604 --> 00:45:55,564
I wish Wheeler could've, too.

594
00:45:56,023 --> 00:45:58,775
Wheeler didn't think
Dude and me was much good.

595
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,862
Leastways it would've showed him
he was wrong about Dude.

596
00:46:01,945 --> 00:46:04,156
He was wrong about Dude, all right.

597
00:46:04,573 --> 00:46:06,617
You were good in there tonight.

598
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,036
Good as you've ever been.

599
00:46:09,369 --> 00:46:12,122
But you know one reason
why you got by with it?

600
00:46:12,497 --> 00:46:16,209
They were laughing at you.
Borrachón talking big.

601
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:19,963
You surprised them.
But next time they'll be ready for you.

602
00:46:20,047 --> 00:46:22,633
Next time they'll shoot first
and laugh afterwards.

603
00:46:22,716 --> 00:46:25,344
- Listen to him.
- Don't get too cocksure.

604
00:46:25,427 --> 00:46:27,387
What a stinker! Spit in his eye.

605
00:46:27,471 --> 00:46:29,973
Never mind him,
he's always been a stinker.

606
00:46:30,057 --> 00:46:32,684
If he were to change, that would worry me.

607
00:46:34,561 --> 00:46:37,105
You'd think I could get one
out of a whole sack.

608
00:46:37,189 --> 00:46:39,816
How'd you know
that fellow was in the loft?

609
00:46:40,192 --> 00:46:43,737
He was losing blood.
It was dripping into a drink on the bar.

610
00:46:43,904 --> 00:46:46,615
Just when I couldn't find anybody
with muddy boots.

611
00:46:46,698 --> 00:46:48,700
I could've sure used a drink then.

612
00:46:48,784 --> 00:46:51,912
If he was bleeding that means
you hit him on the run outside.

613
00:46:51,995 --> 00:46:55,248
You did, Dude? Say, that ain't bad.
That ain't bad at all.

614
00:46:55,374 --> 00:46:58,502
Ain't good either.
We had to go in after him.

615
00:46:59,461 --> 00:47:02,965
Chance, nobody please you no how?

616
00:47:03,382 --> 00:47:05,092
You got a light, Stumpy?

617
00:47:05,425 --> 00:47:08,595
Hey, in the jail! It's me, Colorado.

618
00:47:09,262 --> 00:47:10,430
Let him in.

619
00:47:13,058 --> 00:47:14,268
Come on in.

620
00:47:17,813 --> 00:47:20,357
I hear you got the man who shot Wheeler.

621
00:47:20,524 --> 00:47:21,775
Dude did.

622
00:47:23,443 --> 00:47:24,903
Thanks, Dude.

623
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:28,699
Going to bury him in the morning.

624
00:47:28,782 --> 00:47:31,285
I've just been at the undertaker's with him.

625
00:47:31,368 --> 00:47:33,787
Here's the money and the papers
he had on him.

626
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:35,914
I took out $60 he owed me.

627
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:38,166
You got yours.

628
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,043
How about the rest?

629
00:47:40,168 --> 00:47:41,962
Did he owe them, too?

630
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:43,463
Probably did.

631
00:47:44,006 --> 00:47:45,966
Didn't think about that.

632
00:47:46,258 --> 00:47:49,511
I can't turn anything over to you
till I get a court order.

633
00:47:49,594 --> 00:47:52,806
- Does that mean you hold the wagons, too?
- That's right.

634
00:47:52,889 --> 00:47:54,641
Meantime, I'm broke.

635
00:47:55,517 --> 00:47:58,687
If you or any of the rest are
short eating money...

636
00:47:58,979 --> 00:48:02,316
...I'll go good for it.
I'll tell them at the hotel.

637
00:48:02,649 --> 00:48:06,028
I wish you'd do that soon,
before anything happens to you.

638
00:48:06,361 --> 00:48:08,155
No offense again, Sheriff.

639
00:48:12,492 --> 00:48:15,078
It's nice to see a smart kid for a change.

640
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:18,040
Yeah, he ain't like the usual kid with a gun.

641
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:21,710
Wonder if he's as good as Wheeler said?

642
00:48:22,336 --> 00:48:23,837
I'd say he is.

643
00:48:24,838 --> 00:48:28,383
I'd say he's so good,
he doesn't feel he has to prove it.

644
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:40,479
- Don't you ever sleep?
- I was beginning to think you didn't.

645
00:48:40,562 --> 00:48:41,939
I wanted to talk to you.

646
00:48:42,022 --> 00:48:45,359
Don't tell me
you're still looking for an apology.

647
00:48:46,234 --> 00:48:48,445
No, I was thinking of making one.

648
00:48:48,612 --> 00:48:50,614
I was pretty much of a...

649
00:48:51,031 --> 00:48:53,951
I got out of line tonight
and I'm not proud of it.

650
00:48:54,076 --> 00:48:55,953
My only excuse is...

651
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:59,373
...I didn't know
about all the trouble you were in.

652
00:49:06,672 --> 00:49:09,299
I'm going to have a drink. How about you?

653
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,636
Thanks, I'd like one.

654
00:49:14,805 --> 00:49:17,641
I'm sorry about Mr. Wheeler.

655
00:49:18,016 --> 00:49:20,519
Carlos told me he was a friend of yours.

656
00:49:20,852 --> 00:49:24,356
That's why he got shot.
Or did Carlos tell you that, too?

657
00:49:24,523 --> 00:49:25,941
Yes, he told me.

658
00:49:29,236 --> 00:49:31,446
How does a man get to be a sheriff?

659
00:49:32,114 --> 00:49:33,365
Gets lazy.

660
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:34,908
Gets tired...

661
00:49:35,158 --> 00:49:36,994
...of selling his gun all over...

662
00:49:37,077 --> 00:49:39,079
...decides to sell it in one place.

663
00:49:39,204 --> 00:49:41,164
I'd say you made a poor sale.

664
00:49:41,415 --> 00:49:43,959
A lot of people around here
will agree with you.

665
00:49:44,042 --> 00:49:47,796
But it's still a sale
and it's too late to back out.

666
00:49:47,879 --> 00:49:52,092
Not to change the subject, but how does
a girl get herself on a handbill?

667
00:49:52,968 --> 00:49:54,594
She gets married.

668
00:49:55,387 --> 00:49:58,598
- Handbill says he was a cheat.
- He wasn't a cheat then.

669
00:49:59,057 --> 00:50:02,519
That came later after his luck turned.

670
00:50:03,687 --> 00:50:05,939
It was probably my fault he cheated.

671
00:50:06,064 --> 00:50:08,108
He liked to buy me things.

672
00:50:08,275 --> 00:50:11,028
- Then why did you leave him?
- I didn't.

673
00:50:11,695 --> 00:50:14,615
He left me rather suddenly.

674
00:50:15,824 --> 00:50:18,452
He was caught just like that man tonight...

675
00:50:19,453 --> 00:50:21,455
...only his luck had run out.

676
00:50:21,663 --> 00:50:23,081
He was shot.

677
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:26,001
You've had a rough time.

678
00:50:28,045 --> 00:50:31,089
You're wrong, Sheriff.
I've had a good time.

679
00:50:31,715 --> 00:50:33,133
I liked gambling.

680
00:50:33,842 --> 00:50:36,928
We went everywhere,
had the best of everything.

681
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:42,643
I didn't know that he was cheating
until they caught him.

682
00:50:44,603 --> 00:50:46,772
If I had known, it might have been rough.

683
00:50:46,855 --> 00:50:49,107
That's probably why he didn't tell me.

684
00:50:49,191 --> 00:50:50,776
When did this happen?

685
00:50:50,901 --> 00:50:53,028
About four months ago.

686
00:50:54,947 --> 00:50:58,200
Since then I've been working...

687
00:50:59,493 --> 00:51:01,912
...to get enough money for stage fare.

688
00:51:02,162 --> 00:51:03,705
You going home?

689
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:05,332
I haven't any.

690
00:51:05,457 --> 00:51:06,750
Señor Chance!

691
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:09,586
I didn't know you were here.
Why do you not tell me?

692
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:13,090
You should be in bed.
Last night you slept just a little bit.

693
00:51:13,173 --> 00:51:16,093
But tonight, you will sleep well.
I will watch.

694
00:51:16,176 --> 00:51:18,428
No, Carlos, you stay out of it.

695
00:51:18,512 --> 00:51:20,847
I don't want anybody else helping me.

696
00:51:23,141 --> 00:51:24,768
This is my hotel...

697
00:51:25,018 --> 00:51:27,396
...and you are a guest under my roof.

698
00:51:27,688 --> 00:51:31,525
And I will not be told what I shall do
and what I shall not do.

699
00:51:32,985 --> 00:51:35,112
- All right, Carlos.
- What you do?

700
00:51:35,195 --> 00:51:36,488
I'll sleep in the jail.

701
00:51:36,571 --> 00:51:37,948
But you can't sleep...

702
00:51:38,031 --> 00:51:39,241
Bueno, señor.

703
00:51:39,324 --> 00:51:41,952
There's no need to watch.
I'm a light sleeper.

704
00:51:42,035 --> 00:51:44,871
I'll lock the door
and hook a chair under the knob.

705
00:51:45,038 --> 00:51:47,457
Anybody tries to get in, I'll hear them.

706
00:51:47,541 --> 00:51:49,126
- One thing.
- What?

707
00:51:49,209 --> 00:51:51,545
If I'm asleep at sunup, wake me.

708
00:51:52,296 --> 00:51:54,423
- But it's not enough.
- Will you?

709
00:51:54,548 --> 00:51:58,135
Bueno, señor. I say no more.
Have a good sleep.

710
00:51:58,218 --> 00:52:00,387
I don't want to meddle in your business.

711
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:02,097
I'm going to turn in.

712
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:04,808
If I don't see you in the morning, so long.

713
00:52:04,891 --> 00:52:05,976
So long.

714
00:52:06,268 --> 00:52:09,229
By the way, where are you going?

715
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:12,399
Some place where
there aren't any handbills.

716
00:52:12,482 --> 00:52:16,528
That thing keeps popping up.
That's why I'm a little touchy about it.

717
00:52:18,238 --> 00:52:20,657
I know the sheriff that got these out.

718
00:52:21,783 --> 00:52:24,745
I'll write him a letter, get them called in.

719
00:52:25,704 --> 00:52:29,041
Then you won't have people like me
making trouble for you.

720
00:52:42,095 --> 00:52:43,263
Thanks.

721
00:53:23,971 --> 00:53:24,888
Carlos!

722
00:53:24,972 --> 00:53:26,056
Si, señor.

723
00:53:26,139 --> 00:53:29,101
It's after 7:00.
Why didn't you wake me up?

724
00:53:29,184 --> 00:53:30,435
- The girl.
- The girl?

725
00:53:30,519 --> 00:53:33,438
- That one with the feathers.
- What's she got to do with it?

726
00:53:33,522 --> 00:53:35,148
She told me not to wake you.

727
00:53:35,232 --> 00:53:37,526
She was sitting outside your room
in a chair.

728
00:53:37,609 --> 00:53:39,569
Sitting outside my room in a chair?

729
00:53:39,695 --> 00:53:40,696
All night long.

730
00:53:40,821 --> 00:53:43,031
She was still there two, three minutes ago.

731
00:53:43,156 --> 00:53:46,743
Most likely she hear you get up.
She told me not to wake you.

732
00:53:46,827 --> 00:53:48,662
You can tell her...

733
00:53:49,496 --> 00:53:50,330
The fool!

734
00:53:50,414 --> 00:53:51,748
Tell her she's a fool?

735
00:53:51,832 --> 00:53:54,751
No! I'll tell her myself.

736
00:53:54,876 --> 00:53:56,628
You tell her she's a fool?

737
00:53:56,753 --> 00:53:58,297
I didn't say I was.

738
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:01,550
He say, "Not to wake him up."

739
00:54:01,633 --> 00:54:03,760
She say, "To wake him up."

740
00:54:03,844 --> 00:54:05,804
Me, I'm in the middle. Ay, Dios.

741
00:54:09,266 --> 00:54:10,100
Who is it?

742
00:54:10,183 --> 00:54:11,560
It's me. The sheriff.

743
00:54:11,643 --> 00:54:13,228
Just a minute.

744
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,528
Come on in.

745
00:54:25,824 --> 00:54:26,825
Hi.

746
00:54:27,492 --> 00:54:29,328
Did you get a good night's sleep?

747
00:54:29,411 --> 00:54:30,245
Who? Me?

748
00:54:30,329 --> 00:54:32,873
Yes, you. There's nobody else in the room.

749
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,500
Carlos had to go and talk.

750
00:54:36,585 --> 00:54:40,088
I couldn't sleep anyway.
I was just as well off out there in the hall.

751
00:54:40,213 --> 00:54:43,884
If anybody had come in, you'd have yelled
before they shot you. Is that it?

752
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,801
Fool women.

753
00:54:44,926 --> 00:54:47,137
- Didn't you hear me say that...
- I know.

754
00:54:47,262 --> 00:54:50,432
You don't want anyone to help you.
I heard you tell Carlos.

755
00:54:50,515 --> 00:54:53,185
- Why did you do it?
- You weren't supposed to know.

756
00:54:53,268 --> 00:54:55,729
Why didn't you just go out
and not talk to Carlos?

757
00:54:55,812 --> 00:54:57,356
He didn't wake me up!

758
00:54:57,481 --> 00:54:59,942
Don't blame him, that was my fault.

759
00:55:00,233 --> 00:55:02,694
All right, nothing happened,
nobody got hurt.

760
00:55:02,819 --> 00:55:05,113
You got some sleep, I lost some.

761
00:55:05,322 --> 00:55:08,492
Now I'm tired and you're mad
and I'm getting mad. So...

762
00:55:08,575 --> 00:55:10,118
...you'd better go on.

763
00:55:10,202 --> 00:55:12,079
I'm going to get some sleep, too.

764
00:55:12,245 --> 00:55:14,206
You can't go to bed now!

765
00:55:14,706 --> 00:55:15,874
I can't?

766
00:55:16,458 --> 00:55:19,336
You just see whether or not
I can go to bed now or not.

767
00:55:19,419 --> 00:55:21,463
You've got to get on that stagecoach.

768
00:55:21,546 --> 00:55:24,341
- What'd you say?
- The stage, it leaves in an hour.

769
00:55:24,424 --> 00:55:26,718
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I just did!

770
00:55:27,386 --> 00:55:31,598
Then you better get out then,
so I can get a bath and pack my things.

771
00:55:31,723 --> 00:55:33,850
I can't do it if you stand around talking.

772
00:55:33,934 --> 00:55:35,811
You're doing most of the talking.

773
00:55:35,936 --> 00:55:38,563
That's right. And I can't do that
and bathe and pack.

774
00:55:38,647 --> 00:55:40,691
- Will you just go on and go?
- I'm going.

775
00:55:40,774 --> 00:55:42,526
Then do it, don't talk any more.

776
00:55:42,609 --> 00:55:45,487
I'm doing enough
and neither of us are saying anything.

777
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:48,198
So, just go on and let me get on the stage.

778
00:55:49,616 --> 00:55:51,285
Oh, hell! Goodbye.

779
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:53,578
I just wanted to...

780
00:55:54,871 --> 00:55:57,249
You could have at least let me finish.

781
00:55:57,916 --> 00:56:01,753
You try to help someone
who doesn't want any help.

782
00:56:02,963 --> 00:56:04,923
I guess I talk too much.

783
00:56:07,134 --> 00:56:08,218
You tell her?

784
00:56:08,302 --> 00:56:10,595
- Tell her what?
- That she's a fool.

785
00:56:12,431 --> 00:56:13,765
She's going on the stage?

786
00:56:13,849 --> 00:56:16,226
She's going on the stage.
You make sure she does.

787
00:56:16,351 --> 00:56:18,812
You say she was going,
why should I make sure?

788
00:56:18,895 --> 00:56:21,189
Because I say for you
to make sure she does.

789
00:56:21,315 --> 00:56:22,649
I hold you responsible.

790
00:56:22,733 --> 00:56:24,109
Responsible, me?

791
00:56:24,192 --> 00:56:25,027
Yes.

792
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:31,700
Dude, he's up the street.
He told me to tell you he's gone.

793
00:56:31,783 --> 00:56:33,035
So I see.

794
00:56:33,827 --> 00:56:36,788
There's a lot of people in town today.

795
00:56:37,331 --> 00:56:38,749
Did you hear why?

796
00:56:38,832 --> 00:56:43,378
A man say he hear maybe Nathan Burdette
will come to see you today.

797
00:56:43,545 --> 00:56:45,589
Most likely they here to watch.

798
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:49,343
If he does, they may see something.

799
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:51,428
I don't like it.

800
00:56:51,511 --> 00:56:52,763
Neither do I.

801
00:56:59,019 --> 00:57:02,272
Tom, hang your gun on the fence.
You'll pick it up when you leave.

802
00:57:02,356 --> 00:57:05,150
Sure enough.

803
00:57:30,676 --> 00:57:32,344
That's far enough.

804
00:57:32,552 --> 00:57:34,596
I got orders to take your guns.

805
00:57:35,305 --> 00:57:37,432
Suppose we don't want to give them up?

806
00:57:37,557 --> 00:57:40,352
Think you're good enough
to take them against six of us?

807
00:57:40,435 --> 00:57:43,563
For a smart man, Mr. Burdette,
that's pretty stupid.

808
00:57:44,106 --> 00:57:47,609
You won't need a gun no more
because you'd be the first man I'd get.

809
00:57:47,693 --> 00:57:49,069
Come on, let's go.

810
00:57:49,152 --> 00:57:51,530
Harris, you're pretty good right there.

811
00:57:54,241 --> 00:57:55,617
Hold it, Harris!

812
00:57:55,742 --> 00:57:56,910
He cut my reins.

813
00:57:56,994 --> 00:58:00,497
I'd say he did it on purpose.
And I'm telling you to hold it.

814
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,131
Now hang your guns on the fence
and you can pick them up when you leave.

815
00:58:09,214 --> 00:58:10,716
Hang up your guns.

816
00:58:18,765 --> 00:58:21,310
You're pretty good with that gun
when you're sober.

817
00:58:21,435 --> 00:58:23,020
Not bad.

818
00:58:23,312 --> 00:58:24,688
How does that happen?

819
00:58:24,771 --> 00:58:28,191
If you mean being good with a gun,
I've had a lot of practice.

820
00:58:28,775 --> 00:58:30,819
If you mean being sober...

821
00:58:30,944 --> 00:58:33,905
...I'm getting practice on account
of your brother.

822
00:58:33,989 --> 00:58:35,240
I don't follow you.

823
00:58:35,365 --> 00:58:37,909
You don't have to follow me. Matt!

824
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:41,371
Didn't you hear the boss say
that I was sober?

825
00:58:41,455 --> 00:58:44,499
That extra gun in your vest,
lay that on the fence, too.

826
00:58:48,378 --> 00:58:51,798
- You're enjoying yourself, aren't you?
- All right, Mr. Burdette...

827
00:58:51,882 --> 00:58:54,635
...get going.
I got no more to talk to you about.

828
00:58:54,718 --> 00:58:56,595
You should enjoy it, Dude.

829
00:58:56,803 --> 00:59:00,557
Every man should have a little taste
of power before he's through.

830
00:59:20,869 --> 00:59:21,870
Stumpy!

831
00:59:22,621 --> 00:59:24,456
Burdette and his men are coming in.

832
00:59:24,539 --> 00:59:27,167
Don't put down no red carpet for them.

833
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:29,628
And I'm staying right
where I'm supposed to.

834
00:59:29,711 --> 00:59:31,129
You do that.

835
00:59:34,341 --> 00:59:36,009
Good morning, Sheriff.

836
00:59:36,468 --> 00:59:37,844
Hello, Burdette.

837
00:59:38,553 --> 00:59:40,305
Been expecting you.

838
00:59:40,722 --> 00:59:42,432
I want to see my brother.

839
00:59:42,516 --> 00:59:43,934
You can come in.

840
00:59:44,851 --> 00:59:48,855
But that doesn't mean the rest of you.
He's not your brother.

841
00:59:49,022 --> 00:59:51,233
Go on across the street with the others.

842
00:59:51,316 --> 00:59:52,818
Do as he says.

843
00:59:54,152 --> 00:59:56,530
What are all those people doing in town?

844
00:59:56,822 --> 00:59:58,282
I didn't ask.

845
00:59:58,824 --> 01:00:02,077
Didn't ask them to come,
or ask them why they're here.

846
01:00:03,161 --> 01:00:06,373
But I think they're watching to see
what you're going to do.

847
01:00:08,792 --> 01:00:12,379
You don't like that, do you?
Too many witnesses.

848
01:00:13,213 --> 01:00:16,466
Now do you want to keep talking to me
or see your brother?

849
01:00:17,301 --> 01:00:18,844
See my brother.

850
01:00:21,305 --> 01:00:23,015
We're coming in, Stumpy.

851
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:26,560
Come ahead.
Don't wait for me to carry you.

852
01:00:34,109 --> 01:00:36,236
All right, Stumpy, open up.

853
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:38,572
What's the password?

854
01:00:38,655 --> 01:00:39,656
Come on.

855
01:00:39,781 --> 01:00:42,534
I'm coming. I wouldn't miss this.

856
01:00:42,618 --> 01:00:46,455
Just want him to see how we're set up.
Look who's here.

857
01:00:46,705 --> 01:00:49,166
Place's getting all cluttered up
with Burdettes.

858
01:00:49,249 --> 01:00:50,792
Come right in, Mr. Burdette.

859
01:00:50,876 --> 01:00:54,379
That fellow round the corner
with a banged-up face is your brother.

860
01:00:54,504 --> 01:00:55,672
Nathan.

861
01:00:56,465 --> 01:00:57,549
Joe.

862
01:00:58,717 --> 01:01:00,927
Looks like they gave you a going over.

863
01:01:01,053 --> 01:01:02,638
Our friend here.

864
01:01:04,056 --> 01:01:04,973
Why?

865
01:01:05,307 --> 01:01:08,644
He didn't take too kindly
to being arrested for murder.

866
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:10,437
It wasn't murder.

867
01:01:10,729 --> 01:01:13,523
If he says it wasn't murder,
why do you say it was?

868
01:01:13,607 --> 01:01:17,694
Man gets shot that's got a gun,
there's room for reasonable doubt.

869
01:01:18,737 --> 01:01:21,990
Man gets shot that hasn't got a gun,
what would you call it?

870
01:01:22,783 --> 01:01:27,412
You knew that already, otherwise you
wouldn't have set things up like you did.

871
01:01:27,704 --> 01:01:29,164
Just what have I done?

872
01:01:29,247 --> 01:01:30,958
You're a rich man, Burdette.

873
01:01:31,041 --> 01:01:32,292
Big ranch.

874
01:01:32,417 --> 01:01:35,253
Pay a lot of people to do
what you want them to do.

875
01:01:35,796 --> 01:01:37,547
And you got a brother.

876
01:01:37,631 --> 01:01:40,092
He's no good, but he's your brother.

877
01:01:40,801 --> 01:01:44,388
If he committed 20 murders,
you'd try and see he didn't hang for them.

878
01:01:44,513 --> 01:01:46,181
I don't like that kind of talk.

879
01:01:46,264 --> 01:01:48,558
- You're accusing me...
- Let's get this straight.

880
01:01:48,684 --> 01:01:50,269
You don't like it.

881
01:01:50,352 --> 01:01:52,312
I don't like a lot of things.

882
01:01:52,479 --> 01:01:56,149
I don't like your men sitting on the road
bottling up this town.

883
01:01:56,275 --> 01:02:00,529
I don't like your men watching us,
trying to catch us with our backs turned.

884
01:02:00,612 --> 01:02:03,490
And I don't like it
when a friend of mine offers to help...

885
01:02:03,573 --> 01:02:05,701
...and 20 minutes later he's dead!

886
01:02:06,493 --> 01:02:09,663
And I don't like you, Burdette,
because you set it up.

887
01:02:12,457 --> 01:02:14,668
What're you going to do about it?

888
01:02:15,752 --> 01:02:17,963
I thought you'd get around to that.

889
01:02:18,588 --> 01:02:21,049
I'm going to sit here
with your brother in my lap...

890
01:02:21,174 --> 01:02:24,011
...until the United States Marshal
gets here.

891
01:02:24,136 --> 01:02:26,179
That'll be about six days.

892
01:02:26,513 --> 01:02:29,683
He may ask a few questions
about that busted wheel.

893
01:02:30,309 --> 01:02:33,562
But I think you're too smart
to have stopped that stage completely.

894
01:02:33,687 --> 01:02:35,355
Now I'm running out of breath.

895
01:02:35,439 --> 01:02:37,399
You talk if you want to.

896
01:02:38,066 --> 01:02:41,028
He talks awful big for a man
that's all alone...

897
01:02:41,194 --> 01:02:43,488
...except for a barfly and a cripple.

898
01:02:44,865 --> 01:02:47,701
- You can get me out of here any...
- Shut up, Joe!

899
01:02:48,118 --> 01:02:50,912
You're not as smart as your brother, Joe.

900
01:02:51,538 --> 01:02:55,542
He sees Stumpy here sitting
around the corner locked in with you.

901
01:02:56,376 --> 01:02:59,171
And if that isn't plain enough,
I'll tell you why.

902
01:02:59,254 --> 01:03:01,882
If any trouble starts around this jail...

903
01:03:01,965 --> 01:03:05,969
...before anybody can get to you,
you're going to get accidentally shot.

904
01:03:06,553 --> 01:03:08,847
I can practical guarantee that.

905
01:03:10,098 --> 01:03:13,060
I see you still have
a little grudge against us.

906
01:03:14,478 --> 01:03:17,814
460 acres might be little to you, Nathan.

907
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:20,275
But it was a lot of country to me.

908
01:03:20,359 --> 01:03:24,363
Don't take no chances, Nathan.
He looks just crazy enough to shoot me.

909
01:03:24,738 --> 01:03:26,615
He's smarter than I thought.

910
01:03:27,741 --> 01:03:30,786
You know,
a court might just call that murder, too.

911
01:03:31,244 --> 01:03:32,871
What's the difference?

912
01:03:32,996 --> 01:03:34,957
We'd all be dead by then.

913
01:03:35,248 --> 01:03:37,626
You got anything else you want to say?

914
01:03:38,085 --> 01:03:41,421
Just one thing. Joe has friends.

915
01:03:42,255 --> 01:03:44,633
You can't hold Joe
or me responsible for them...

916
01:03:44,716 --> 01:03:47,594
...what you say they've done
or what they might do.

917
01:03:48,053 --> 01:03:49,638
I want to make that clear.

918
01:03:49,721 --> 01:03:51,556
I'll help you make it clear.

919
01:03:51,682 --> 01:03:54,351
I don't think Joe's got a friend in the world.

920
01:03:54,434 --> 01:03:58,689
And he won't have any unless somebody
buys them for him at $50 a head.

921
01:03:59,106 --> 01:04:01,483
Like the fellow that shot Wheeler.

922
01:04:03,151 --> 01:04:04,820
You made it clear.

923
01:04:05,195 --> 01:04:06,613
All right, Stumpy.

924
01:04:06,697 --> 01:04:08,573
- Nathan.
- Just sit tight, Joe.

925
01:04:08,699 --> 01:04:10,659
Send me a bottle before you leave town.

926
01:04:10,784 --> 01:04:14,371
You do that, because part of my job
is to see that it ain't poisoned.

927
01:04:14,496 --> 01:04:17,332
Sometimes takes quite a spell to find out.

928
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:24,464
- He didn't have much to say, did he?
- No.

929
01:04:29,886 --> 01:04:33,223
What did you leave him go for?
You had plenty to hold him on.

930
01:04:33,348 --> 01:04:35,017
Anything they're going to do is...

931
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:37,561
...planned already,
or he wouldn't have come in here.

932
01:04:37,686 --> 01:04:41,106
Throwing him with Joe would give him
an alibi for whatever happens.

933
01:04:41,189 --> 01:04:42,566
I never thought of that.

934
01:04:42,649 --> 01:04:44,943
- What do you think will happen?
- I don't know.

935
01:04:45,068 --> 01:04:46,820
You can think, can't you? Any man...

936
01:04:47,321 --> 01:04:51,241
I think I told you to get back in there
and stay with that door locked.

937
01:04:51,325 --> 01:04:53,869
Be careful how you talk to me.
You hear what Joe said.

938
01:04:53,994 --> 01:04:57,331
You're alone except for a barfly
and an old cripple.

939
01:04:57,497 --> 01:05:01,501
Calling me an old cripple.
I like hearing you say that, Joe.

940
01:05:02,044 --> 01:05:04,588
I got to fix your supper for you tonight.

941
01:05:09,843 --> 01:05:10,927
Señor Chance.

942
01:05:11,011 --> 01:05:12,512
It's me, Carlos.

943
01:05:12,596 --> 01:05:13,972
Come on in.

944
01:05:14,473 --> 01:05:15,557
What do you want?

945
01:05:15,641 --> 01:05:16,975
I want to talk to you.

946
01:05:17,059 --> 01:05:18,518
Did the girl...

947
01:05:19,478 --> 01:05:21,146
What happened to your eye?

948
01:05:21,229 --> 01:05:23,357
You told me to put the lady on the stage.

949
01:05:23,482 --> 01:05:25,359
She did that? What'd you do?

950
01:05:25,442 --> 01:05:27,986
- She did not do it.
- I thought you said she did.

951
01:05:28,070 --> 01:05:32,115
I say you tell me to put her on the stage.
Consuelo, she hit me in the eye.

952
01:05:32,199 --> 01:05:35,118
- I'm a little mixed up.
- Do not talk. I tell you.

953
01:05:35,202 --> 01:05:36,995
- Okay.
- It's better if I tell you.

954
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:40,999
You told me to put her on the stage.
The stage she's ready, but she don't come.

955
01:05:41,124 --> 01:05:43,502
I yell at her, "Come down."
She said, "No."

956
01:05:43,627 --> 01:05:46,296
- I go and get her, she said she don't go.
- Did she go?

957
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:49,091
I tell her you say go.
I tell her I am responsible.

958
01:05:49,174 --> 01:05:52,177
She say, no, she is responsible.
And I said that may be.

959
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:55,764
I pick her up. And Consuelo say,
"What are you doing with that woman?"

960
01:05:55,847 --> 01:05:59,268
I say, "I take her to the stage."
The woman said she don't want to go.

961
01:05:59,393 --> 01:06:00,936
Did she go on the stage?

962
01:06:01,019 --> 01:06:04,439
Consuelo tell me put her down.
I said, "I am responsible."

963
01:06:04,564 --> 01:06:07,693
Consuelo thinks that mean something else.
So she give me this eye.

964
01:06:07,776 --> 01:06:08,860
What'd you do?

965
01:06:08,986 --> 01:06:11,822
Do? What can I do?
My arms is full of the lady.

966
01:06:11,905 --> 01:06:16,285
I can do nothing. I drop her on the floor.
She yells. And she says I tried to kill her.

967
01:06:16,368 --> 01:06:17,953
Did the girl get on the stage?

968
01:06:18,036 --> 01:06:20,747
No, she did not go!
But Jake says he couldn't wait.

969
01:06:20,831 --> 01:06:22,541
- Why?
- He says he must leave.

970
01:06:22,624 --> 01:06:25,168
I mean the girl.
Did she say why she wasn't going?

971
01:06:25,294 --> 01:06:28,338
No. She didn't say.
How can I know if she don't say?

972
01:06:28,422 --> 01:06:32,175
Please come and tell Consuelo
what responsible means.

973
01:06:32,259 --> 01:06:33,885
Stumpy, we're going out.

974
01:06:33,969 --> 01:06:37,180
Fine. I like to be left alone.
I'm getting used to it.

975
01:06:45,772 --> 01:06:47,274
The door's unlocked.

976
01:06:54,114 --> 01:06:55,616
I didn't go.

977
01:06:56,116 --> 01:06:57,618
I can see that.

978
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:01,163
I don't know...

979
01:07:01,663 --> 01:07:05,250
...I had everything all packed,
then Carlos yelled the stage was ready...

980
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:08,337
...and I heard somebody saying
they weren't going.

981
01:07:09,338 --> 01:07:11,131
It was me saying it.

982
01:07:11,465 --> 01:07:14,718
And you want to know why I didn't go,
don't you, Sheriff?

983
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,514
What's your name, anyway?
I don't even know that.

984
01:07:19,598 --> 01:07:21,475
Chance, John T.

985
01:07:21,767 --> 01:07:23,268
"T" for trouble.

986
01:07:24,019 --> 01:07:26,772
I always make you mad, don't I, John T?

987
01:07:28,273 --> 01:07:30,817
Then, don't make me tell you why I stayed.

988
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,155
I won't make it any harder for you.

989
01:07:35,238 --> 01:07:37,991
I won't get in your way. I'll just be here.

990
01:07:39,159 --> 01:07:40,911
You don't owe me a thing.

991
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:43,580
And you won't owe me when it's all over.

992
01:07:44,289 --> 01:07:47,292
When that happens,
just tell me to go, and I'll go.

993
01:07:49,461 --> 01:07:51,922
No, you won't even have to tell me.

994
01:07:52,673 --> 01:07:54,967
I'll know by then, and I'll just go.

995
01:07:56,093 --> 01:07:57,970
Is that fair, John T?

996
01:08:02,849 --> 01:08:05,936
You don't have to answer me now
if you don't want to.

997
01:08:07,479 --> 01:08:11,066
But just say something.

998
01:08:12,359 --> 01:08:16,446
If I weren't in this mess,
it might be different.

999
01:08:17,447 --> 01:08:18,824
But I am.

1000
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,160
That's all I wanted to hear.

1001
01:08:42,723 --> 01:08:44,933
I'm glad we tried it a second time.

1002
01:08:45,809 --> 01:08:47,936
It's better when two people do it.

1003
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,524
I've kept you long enough.

1004
01:08:53,025 --> 01:08:55,569
You'd better run along now
and do your job.

1005
01:10:58,025 --> 01:10:59,192
Hi, Chance.

1006
01:10:59,318 --> 01:11:03,363
It's getting too dark to do any good
out there. I'd just be a sitting duck.

1007
01:11:03,864 --> 01:11:05,907
Anything happen when Burdette left?

1008
01:11:06,033 --> 01:11:07,784
Nice as pie. Didn't say a word.

1009
01:11:07,868 --> 01:11:09,703
What was the shot when they came in?

1010
01:11:09,786 --> 01:11:12,080
That gunslinger of his was on the prod.

1011
01:11:12,164 --> 01:11:13,081
What'd he do?

1012
01:11:13,206 --> 01:11:16,209
Nothing, just grunted and growled,
made a few faces.

1013
01:11:16,585 --> 01:11:18,712
Took care of that. What happened here?

1014
01:11:18,795 --> 01:11:20,047
Not much.

1015
01:11:21,923 --> 01:11:24,676
That tune, they been playing it all day.

1016
01:11:24,885 --> 01:11:26,219
What is it?

1017
01:11:26,553 --> 01:11:29,640
It's some Mexican piece.
I heard it farther south.

1018
01:11:31,266 --> 01:11:32,893
Good evening, Sheriff.

1019
01:11:33,018 --> 01:11:35,062
Colorado. What do you want?

1020
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,147
Just curious again.

1021
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:39,274
How'd you come out with Burdette?

1022
01:11:39,358 --> 01:11:41,318
He wanted to talk to his brother.

1023
01:11:41,401 --> 01:11:43,695
- What'd he have to say?
- Nothing.

1024
01:11:43,946 --> 01:11:45,656
You mean he didn't say anything?

1025
01:11:45,739 --> 01:11:47,491
Why are you so interested?

1026
01:11:47,574 --> 01:11:49,618
Because he's talking now.

1027
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:51,411
Hear that music?

1028
01:11:51,536 --> 01:11:53,330
He told the man to play it.

1029
01:11:54,581 --> 01:11:55,666
What is it?

1030
01:11:55,916 --> 01:11:58,835
They call it The Deguello,
the cutthroat song.

1031
01:11:58,919 --> 01:12:03,465
The Mexicans played it for the Texas boys
when they had them pent up at the Alamo.

1032
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:06,301
Played it day and night till it was all over.

1033
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,887
Now do you know what he means by it?

1034
01:12:09,012 --> 01:12:10,389
No quarter.

1035
01:12:11,181 --> 01:12:13,016
No mercy for the losers.

1036
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,768
You'll be hearing a lot of it.

1037
01:12:14,851 --> 01:12:17,396
I guess we made him talk after all.

1038
01:12:17,562 --> 01:12:20,107
Just thought you'd like to know, Sheriff.

1039
01:13:19,374 --> 01:13:20,375
Stumpy!

1040
01:13:20,667 --> 01:13:23,587
- What?
- They don't need any help with that tune.

1041
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:26,548
What's the matter,
is it getting through to you?

1042
01:13:33,597 --> 01:13:36,350
By the way, the stage got off all right.

1043
01:13:38,268 --> 01:13:40,646
I watched it clear through the valley.

1044
01:13:42,356 --> 01:13:45,317
In about six days the marshal will get here.

1045
01:13:45,484 --> 01:13:47,110
That's what I figured.

1046
01:13:50,864 --> 01:13:52,991
The girl wasn't on the stage.

1047
01:13:55,494 --> 01:13:56,870
I know that.

1048
01:13:59,164 --> 01:14:00,874
Tell her she could stay?

1049
01:14:01,208 --> 01:14:02,376
No, she...

1050
01:14:04,127 --> 01:14:06,254
Yes, I did. What about it?

1051
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:08,173
Nothing, nothing at all.

1052
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:10,050
You were going to say something.

1053
01:14:10,133 --> 01:14:11,927
I remembered in time.

1054
01:14:13,303 --> 01:14:17,474
I remembered another girl came through
on a stage that stopped over.

1055
01:14:18,684 --> 01:14:21,144
I remember you told me she was no good.

1056
01:14:21,937 --> 01:14:24,481
I didn't believe you, but you were right.

1057
01:14:24,606 --> 01:14:26,900
So, naturally I figured you're an expert.

1058
01:14:27,025 --> 01:14:29,945
And you know just
what you're doing all the time.

1059
01:14:31,071 --> 01:14:33,782
I just hope you have better luck than I had.

1060
01:14:36,243 --> 01:14:39,913
You know, that's the first time
I've been able to laugh about that.

1061
01:14:40,038 --> 01:14:41,832
Maybe there's some hope for me yet.

1062
01:14:41,915 --> 01:14:42,666
Maybe.

1063
01:14:43,292 --> 01:14:44,376
But I doubt it.

1064
01:14:44,501 --> 01:14:48,088
That's what I like about you,
you're such an encouraging man.

1065
01:14:49,006 --> 01:14:52,342
If you go by the hotel,
pick up some coffee and sugar, will you?

1066
01:14:52,426 --> 01:14:53,677
Joe complaining?

1067
01:14:53,802 --> 01:14:55,554
Him? He didn't get no sugar.

1068
01:14:55,637 --> 01:14:58,098
His coffee's water poured
over the old grounds.

1069
01:14:58,181 --> 01:15:00,225
I'll learn him to talk out of turn.

1070
01:15:00,309 --> 01:15:04,563
Before I forget, your gun's a little stiff.
You mind if I file the action a bit?

1071
01:15:04,646 --> 01:15:06,940
I don't want you to file no action
on my gun.

1072
01:15:07,024 --> 01:15:10,777
I don't want no easy pull. I might
shoot myself. Get somebody else's.

1073
01:15:11,111 --> 01:15:13,405
Why don't you give him his own guns?

1074
01:15:14,281 --> 01:15:17,367
- I forgot all about them.
- Your memory is no better than mine.

1075
01:15:17,451 --> 01:15:19,911
They been locked up over a year
except when you...

1076
01:15:20,037 --> 01:15:22,664
...took them out
to clean them and oil them.

1077
01:15:30,422 --> 01:15:32,132
Where'd you get these?

1078
01:15:32,591 --> 01:15:35,385
Bought them off the fellow
you sold them to.

1079
01:15:41,642 --> 01:15:43,435
I don't know how to...

1080
01:15:44,144 --> 01:15:47,898
Let's take a turn around the town.
Get Stumpy his coffee.

1081
01:15:48,023 --> 01:15:50,400
Ain't you going to tell me
to get back in there?

1082
01:15:50,484 --> 01:15:53,236
No, stay out here and get shot.

1083
01:15:53,654 --> 01:15:55,697
I might do that just for spite.

1084
01:15:55,948 --> 01:15:57,908
Might get a laugh out of you.

1085
01:15:58,617 --> 01:16:00,994
What I put up with for $30 a month.

1086
01:16:20,389 --> 01:16:21,723
Feels good.

1087
01:16:21,807 --> 01:16:22,891
Come on.

1088
01:16:23,308 --> 01:16:25,519
By the way, am I drawing pay?

1089
01:16:25,936 --> 01:16:27,187
Same as before.

1090
01:16:27,312 --> 01:16:30,023
In that case take out
what you gave for these guns.

1091
01:16:30,107 --> 01:16:31,358
No hurry.

1092
01:16:31,858 --> 01:16:34,611
If you're feeling so generous,
I could use an advance.

1093
01:16:34,695 --> 01:16:38,532
Buy a new pair of pants, new shirt.
Something without all these holes in it.

1094
01:16:38,657 --> 01:16:39,741
No need of that.

1095
01:16:39,866 --> 01:16:42,828
When you lit out,
you left some things behind.

1096
01:16:43,537 --> 01:16:45,414
I got them at the hotel.

1097
01:16:46,206 --> 01:16:48,417
You been keeping them all this time?

1098
01:16:49,251 --> 01:16:51,545
Been waiting till they fit you again.

1099
01:16:53,964 --> 01:16:57,050
You could use a bath and a shave, too.

1100
01:16:57,426 --> 01:17:01,013
I don't know about the shave.
I'm liable to cut my own throat.

1101
01:17:02,764 --> 01:17:03,849
Chance?

1102
01:17:04,224 --> 01:17:05,309
Yeah?

1103
01:17:05,601 --> 01:17:06,852
They'll fit.

1104
01:17:07,561 --> 01:17:08,645
Thanks.

1105
01:17:40,427 --> 01:17:41,678
There you are.

1106
01:17:48,352 --> 01:17:50,228
How about you, John T?

1107
01:17:50,562 --> 01:17:52,230
Shall I work on you?

1108
01:17:52,439 --> 01:17:54,191
I do my own shaving.

1109
01:17:54,942 --> 01:17:56,401
I thought you did.

1110
01:17:56,693 --> 01:17:58,654
I was just reminding you.

1111
01:18:05,619 --> 01:18:07,829
Sure buy a lot of drinks with that.

1112
01:18:10,290 --> 01:18:11,625
You sure could.

1113
01:18:14,628 --> 01:18:16,505
I'll let you keep it for me.

1114
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:21,843
Feathers, thanks for the shave.
Might call on you again.

1115
01:18:21,927 --> 01:18:23,887
Anytime, because I'll be here.

1116
01:18:24,096 --> 01:18:27,224
I didn't tell you, John T.,
Carlos is giving me a job.

1117
01:18:27,391 --> 01:18:30,644
Good for Carlos. Shall we take Stumpy
his coffee and things?

1118
01:18:30,811 --> 01:18:33,689
You in a hurry, John T?
I'd like to talk to you.

1119
01:18:33,772 --> 01:18:36,483
- I'll wait for you.
- Thanks, Dude.

1120
01:18:37,109 --> 01:18:39,653
- I just wanted to ask you...
- What's this about a job?

1121
01:18:39,736 --> 01:18:43,657
Carlos says he's not sleeping very well.
Says I can help out downstairs.

1122
01:18:44,241 --> 01:18:45,659
Tending bar?

1123
01:18:45,742 --> 01:18:47,494
Among other things.

1124
01:18:48,662 --> 01:18:50,289
You think I shouldn't?

1125
01:18:50,497 --> 01:18:51,498
Why ask me?

1126
01:18:51,623 --> 01:18:53,667
The way you said "tending bar."

1127
01:18:53,959 --> 01:18:56,420
- All right, I won't do it.
- I didn't say not to.

1128
01:18:56,545 --> 01:18:58,046
You don't like the idea.

1129
01:18:58,130 --> 01:19:00,757
Why should it be up to me?
Why should I care?

1130
01:19:00,841 --> 01:19:02,884
I don't know why you get mad
when I ask you.

1131
01:19:03,051 --> 01:19:04,761
- I'm not mad.
- You're not?

1132
01:19:04,845 --> 01:19:07,764
- You'd make anybody mad.
- I suppose I would.

1133
01:19:09,099 --> 01:19:12,519
As long as you haven't anything against it,
I'll take the job.

1134
01:19:12,728 --> 01:19:13,729
Go ahead.

1135
01:19:13,895 --> 01:19:15,439
Thanks, I will.

1136
01:19:17,232 --> 01:19:18,734
What were you going to ask me?

1137
01:19:18,817 --> 01:19:22,237
- Never mind. You're in too bad a humor.
- What were you going to ask?

1138
01:19:22,321 --> 01:19:24,865
Whether you were going to sleep
in the hotel tonight.

1139
01:19:24,948 --> 01:19:28,785
Get one thing straight. There'll be no more
chair-sitting outside this door.

1140
01:19:28,869 --> 01:19:30,746
I know. I've given that up.

1141
01:19:30,829 --> 01:19:34,666
Anyway, I have a better idea.
Tonight you sleep in my room.

1142
01:19:34,791 --> 01:19:36,752
Anyone looking wouldn't look there first.

1143
01:19:36,835 --> 01:19:39,546
You'd have more time
if anything did happen.

1144
01:19:40,088 --> 01:19:43,508
Besides, I have a rocking chair,
it's more comfortable.

1145
01:19:44,718 --> 01:19:47,346
Just an idea. You can think about it.

1146
01:19:48,221 --> 01:19:50,599
When you're in a little better humor.

1147
01:20:00,692 --> 01:20:02,444
Chance!

1148
01:20:02,653 --> 01:20:04,529
The shot came from the jail.

1149
01:20:15,582 --> 01:20:16,750
Chance, look out!

1150
01:20:16,833 --> 01:20:18,418
Don't go in there.

1151
01:20:18,543 --> 01:20:20,671
That idiot just took a shot at me.

1152
01:20:21,546 --> 01:20:23,423
Stumpy! You all right?

1153
01:20:24,049 --> 01:20:27,886
Sure I am, but there's a feller out there
with a black hat that ain't.

1154
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:29,513
And I'm that fellow.

1155
01:20:32,099 --> 01:20:33,433
Coming in.

1156
01:20:34,893 --> 01:20:36,770
Look what he did to my hat.

1157
01:20:39,481 --> 01:20:41,358
Stumpy, that was Dude you shot at.

1158
01:20:41,441 --> 01:20:44,778
Dude? I didn't know.
Didn't look like Dude.

1159
01:20:44,861 --> 01:20:46,530
Fool almost blowed my head off.

1160
01:20:46,613 --> 01:20:47,990
How'd I know it was you?

1161
01:20:48,073 --> 01:20:50,450
You get yourself dolled up
like Astor's pet horse...

1162
01:20:50,534 --> 01:20:53,870
...and then stick your nose in that door
and don't say nothing.

1163
01:20:53,954 --> 01:20:55,038
Look at this hat.

1164
01:20:55,122 --> 01:20:58,083
If you hadn't ducked,
that's what your head would look like.

1165
01:20:58,166 --> 01:21:00,294
I never would have fired
if I knew it was you.

1166
01:21:00,419 --> 01:21:02,963
Okay, I know, just stop talking, will you?

1167
01:21:03,130 --> 01:21:05,674
The shot didn't bother me.
I've been shot at before.

1168
01:21:05,799 --> 01:21:07,217
You could have hollered.

1169
01:21:07,301 --> 01:21:10,554
Just 'cause you get cleaned up
don't mean you can't talk.

1170
01:21:10,637 --> 01:21:14,057
It's my fault. I should have yelled.
I shouldn't have taken a bath.

1171
01:21:14,141 --> 01:21:16,435
Just stop talking. Just let it be.

1172
01:21:16,643 --> 01:21:20,063
You been going around for years
like something the cat dragged in...

1173
01:21:20,188 --> 01:21:22,733
...and now you expect...
- Shut up!

1174
01:21:24,901 --> 01:21:27,863
I told you, Stumpy, I've had it.

1175
01:21:28,947 --> 01:21:30,907
Don't let me tell you again.

1176
01:21:47,507 --> 01:21:50,052
You're getting a little touchy, aren't you?

1177
01:21:50,218 --> 01:21:53,472
I've been listening to
that old fool talk until I'm...

1178
01:21:54,765 --> 01:21:56,266
All right, I'm wrong.

1179
01:21:56,350 --> 01:21:59,311
That old fool is talking
because he nearly killed you.

1180
01:21:59,394 --> 01:22:01,521
He's the one that's scared.

1181
01:22:02,773 --> 01:22:04,983
We've been pampering you too much.

1182
01:22:05,734 --> 01:22:07,778
You better get some sleep.

1183
01:22:16,828 --> 01:22:20,499
You know, he acts like I done it
on purpose. And I didn't.

1184
01:22:20,707 --> 01:22:22,459
You see that door there?

1185
01:22:22,876 --> 01:22:25,087
That look like I done it on purpose?

1186
01:22:25,712 --> 01:22:27,839
It's going to get cold here at night.

1187
01:22:27,923 --> 01:22:32,219
And I'm going to leave it get cold.
Because I ain't going to fix that door.

1188
01:22:34,429 --> 01:22:36,223
It weren't my fault.

1189
01:22:38,058 --> 01:22:39,142
Were it?

1190
01:22:45,107 --> 01:22:46,191
I know.

1191
01:22:48,694 --> 01:22:50,153
I'll fix the door.

1192
01:23:04,793 --> 01:23:06,420
Hi, Sheriff.

1193
01:23:17,097 --> 01:23:19,057
How do you like your new job?

1194
01:23:19,266 --> 01:23:21,643
They've been keeping me pretty busy.

1195
01:23:23,103 --> 01:23:25,647
You through for the day? Going to bed?

1196
01:23:25,772 --> 01:23:27,149
I thought I would.

1197
01:23:27,274 --> 01:23:29,484
- Can I make you some coffee?
- No thanks.

1198
01:23:29,568 --> 01:23:31,153
- Anything to eat?
- Nope.

1199
01:23:31,236 --> 01:23:32,696
How about a drink?

1200
01:23:33,947 --> 01:23:35,616
I'll take a drink.

1201
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:39,411
Carlos says this is for special guests.

1202
01:23:40,579 --> 01:23:42,456
Tired, aren't you, John T?

1203
01:23:43,874 --> 01:23:45,709
I can fix you a nice hot bath.

1204
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:47,628
All I want is that drink.

1205
01:23:48,587 --> 01:23:51,632
Then, this is all I can do for you?

1206
01:23:54,176 --> 01:23:56,386
I thought you said I could think about it.

1207
01:23:56,470 --> 01:23:58,930
You're right. I did.

1208
01:24:00,307 --> 01:24:01,975
Put it on the tab.

1209
01:24:02,726 --> 01:24:05,729
In case you make up your mind,
I left my door open.

1210
01:24:09,399 --> 01:24:11,360
Get a good night's sleep.

1211
01:24:11,485 --> 01:24:13,445
You're not helping me any.

1212
01:26:12,272 --> 01:26:13,815
Good morning, Dude.

1213
01:26:14,107 --> 01:26:15,275
Good morning.

1214
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:16,902
Have a good night?

1215
01:26:17,444 --> 01:26:18,612
All right, I guess.

1216
01:26:18,737 --> 01:26:20,113
Eat anything?

1217
01:26:20,906 --> 01:26:22,366
This morning?

1218
01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:24,284
Stumpy fixed something.

1219
01:26:24,368 --> 01:26:27,287
I asked you a question.
You didn't answer it.

1220
01:26:27,496 --> 01:26:30,165
All right, I'll answer you.
I didn't sleep good...

1221
01:26:30,248 --> 01:26:33,377
...didn't eat anything.
I had a beer and it didn't do any good.

1222
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:35,128
Think you can stand your watch?

1223
01:26:35,212 --> 01:26:37,589
When I can't do that I'll let you know.

1224
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:41,153
- That's enough.
- Yeah.

1225
01:27:41,361 --> 01:27:42,946
Where's his hat?

1226
01:27:49,411 --> 01:27:52,664
Get out there.
We'll be along as soon as we get him tied.

1227
01:28:04,259 --> 01:28:07,346
Stumpy, did Dude have a bad night?

1228
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:09,806
He's suffering "thunderation," Chance.

1229
01:28:09,890 --> 01:28:14,353
His mind's just beginning to work again,
and he sees what he done to himself.

1230
01:28:15,062 --> 01:28:16,563
Ain't pretty.

1231
01:28:17,147 --> 01:28:18,899
He's got to sweat it out.

1232
01:28:19,733 --> 01:28:22,110
And don't let him cry
on your shoulder either.

1233
01:28:22,235 --> 01:28:23,487
He ain't done it yet.

1234
01:28:23,570 --> 01:28:26,406
Why are you so god darned ornery?
Always picking on Dude.

1235
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:29,743
- You got any tobacco?
- No, I give the last there was to Dude.

1236
01:28:29,826 --> 01:28:32,454
He uses it up fast.
You got to get some for yourself.

1237
01:28:32,537 --> 01:28:35,332
But what I'm asking you
is why are you picking on Dude?

1238
01:28:35,415 --> 01:28:39,336
All right, be nice to him
and he'll fall apart in small pieces.

1239
01:28:39,586 --> 01:28:42,047
Maybe you're right.
You know him better than I do.

1240
01:28:42,172 --> 01:28:46,009
I guess some folks is built that way.
But that wouldn't work with me.

1241
01:28:46,093 --> 01:28:48,845
You could at least have a kind word
for me now and then.

1242
01:28:48,929 --> 01:28:51,139
Considering what I have to do around here.

1243
01:28:51,264 --> 01:28:55,519
The sweeping, and the cooking, and
the "nursemaiding" that killer back there.

1244
01:28:56,103 --> 01:28:58,313
Not even a "thank you" do I get.

1245
01:28:58,522 --> 01:29:00,399
Maybe you're right, Stumpy.

1246
01:29:01,233 --> 01:29:02,776
You're a treasure.

1247
01:29:04,778 --> 01:29:07,072
I don't know what I'd do without you.

1248
01:29:09,449 --> 01:29:11,034
Go back to being yourself.

1249
01:29:11,118 --> 01:29:12,953
Leastwise I'm used to that.

1250
01:29:48,822 --> 01:29:50,866
He's coming down the street now.

1251
01:29:55,162 --> 01:29:56,788
Good morning, Sheriff.

1252
01:29:57,164 --> 01:29:58,415
Colorado.

1253
01:29:58,665 --> 01:30:01,668
I been hearing a lot of talk.
Thought you might be interested.

1254
01:30:01,752 --> 01:30:02,919
About what?

1255
01:30:03,170 --> 01:30:06,089
Mostly about you telling Burdette
what would happen to Joe...

1256
01:30:06,173 --> 01:30:08,467
...if trouble started around the jail.

1257
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:12,054
Guess he didn't expect to hear that.
Kind of new to me, too.

1258
01:30:12,137 --> 01:30:14,514
- Would you have said it any different?
- No.

1259
01:30:14,681 --> 01:30:18,185
If he was doing to me what he's doing
to you, I'd tell him the same thing.

1260
01:30:18,310 --> 01:30:20,979
He can't take a chance
on whether you'd do it or not.

1261
01:30:21,104 --> 01:30:22,648
I don't suppose so.

1262
01:30:22,731 --> 01:30:25,776
But you can be sure
he's going to try it a different way.

1263
01:30:25,901 --> 01:30:27,778
Got enough left there for another?

1264
01:30:27,861 --> 01:30:29,613
Sure. Help yourself.

1265
01:30:30,697 --> 01:30:32,741
You always keep that carbine cocked?

1266
01:30:32,866 --> 01:30:34,660
Only when I carry it.

1267
01:30:35,494 --> 01:30:37,371
How come you carry a rifle?

1268
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:41,333
I found some were faster than me
with a short gun.

1269
01:30:46,004 --> 01:30:48,465
I don't suppose you have a match either?

1270
01:30:48,674 --> 01:30:50,258
All out of them, too.

1271
01:30:50,425 --> 01:30:51,677
I'll get some.

1272
01:31:01,186 --> 01:31:04,147
Sheriff, we ran into some trouble
on the road.

1273
01:31:04,231 --> 01:31:06,441
Al here is hurt. His horse threw him.

1274
01:31:06,566 --> 01:31:08,860
Your deputy said we could find a doctor.

1275
01:31:08,986 --> 01:31:10,612
Round the corner.

1276
01:31:11,071 --> 01:31:13,198
About three or four doors to the right.

1277
01:31:13,282 --> 01:31:15,325
Stay away from that rifle, Sheriff.

1278
01:31:15,450 --> 01:31:17,411
You can see we've still got our guns.

1279
01:31:17,494 --> 01:31:19,705
That ain't your deputy up the street.

1280
01:31:19,871 --> 01:31:21,373
Unloosen that belt.

1281
01:31:25,085 --> 01:31:27,754
- What've you done to him?
- Don't worry about him.

1282
01:31:27,838 --> 01:31:29,798
Worry about yourself. He's all right.

1283
01:31:29,881 --> 01:31:33,093
He ain't going to be and nor are you
unless you do as you're told.

1284
01:31:33,176 --> 01:31:34,177
Stay back here.

1285
01:31:34,261 --> 01:31:35,846
We're going down to the jail.

1286
01:31:35,929 --> 01:31:37,514
You'll turn Joe Burdette loose...

1287
01:31:37,597 --> 01:31:41,018
...or you and your deputy quit worrying
about this whole thing.

1288
01:31:41,143 --> 01:31:42,519
Take your choice.

1289
01:31:42,644 --> 01:31:44,855
Are you just going to stand here?

1290
01:31:45,147 --> 01:31:47,858
If you want to get him shot,
just go out there.

1291
01:31:48,108 --> 01:31:49,610
What'll it be?

1292
01:31:52,446 --> 01:31:55,532
If you want to do something,
when I get out on the porch...

1293
01:31:55,616 --> 01:31:58,368
...take that flowerpot and throw it
through the window.

1294
01:31:58,452 --> 01:32:00,412
Duck after you throw it.

1295
01:32:07,836 --> 01:32:09,796
Just keep coming, mister.

1296
01:32:10,339 --> 01:32:12,466
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.

1297
01:32:30,984 --> 01:32:32,361
Grab that horse.

1298
01:32:39,117 --> 01:32:42,079
- Colorado, where's he going?
- He's going to see if Dude's all right.

1299
01:32:56,510 --> 01:32:58,095
Chance, over here.

1300
01:33:05,102 --> 01:33:06,895
You look a little used.

1301
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:09,147
What'd they do? I heard shooting.

1302
01:33:09,439 --> 01:33:10,691
They had me cold.

1303
01:33:10,816 --> 01:33:12,776
Going to make me open the jail.

1304
01:33:12,901 --> 01:33:14,152
What happened?

1305
01:33:14,987 --> 01:33:17,281
I didn't have to. Colorado helped me.

1306
01:33:17,364 --> 01:33:20,409
If you'd have had him here,
this wouldn't have happened.

1307
01:33:20,492 --> 01:33:22,369
I can get up by myself!

1308
01:33:23,453 --> 01:33:24,913
I let them get me.

1309
01:33:25,038 --> 01:33:28,375
I let them walk right up
and stick my head in the water trough...

1310
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:30,460
...and it was easy for them.

1311
01:33:32,754 --> 01:33:35,465
I'm good when I'm sober, boy, real good.

1312
01:33:36,842 --> 01:33:38,635
I should have known better.

1313
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:42,389
A man ought to have sense enough
to know when he's no good no more.

1314
01:33:42,556 --> 01:33:44,933
- Where're you going?
- Get your hands off of me.

1315
01:33:45,058 --> 01:33:46,518
I said where're you going?

1316
01:33:46,602 --> 01:33:49,563
You've got no use for a man
you can't depend on.

1317
01:33:49,646 --> 01:33:51,690
One bad night and I'm done for.

1318
01:33:52,399 --> 01:33:55,736
An old man takes a pot shot at me
and I'm finished.

1319
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:59,406
I tried and I tried hard,
and where did it get me?

1320
01:33:59,489 --> 01:34:00,657
Look at me.

1321
01:34:01,074 --> 01:34:02,701
I got them so bad.

1322
01:34:03,493 --> 01:34:05,954
What can a man do with hands like that?

1323
01:34:06,788 --> 01:34:09,082
I'm through. I quit, John. I quit.

1324
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:11,335
All right, quit.

1325
01:34:12,002 --> 01:34:13,712
Nobody's trying to stop you.

1326
01:34:13,795 --> 01:34:15,756
If you want to quit, quit.

1327
01:34:15,881 --> 01:34:18,175
Go on back to the bottle, get drunk!

1328
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:19,843
One thing, though.

1329
01:34:19,926 --> 01:34:24,723
Somebody throws a dollar in a spittoon,
don't expect me to do something about it.

1330
01:34:25,098 --> 01:34:28,018
Just get down on your knees
and go after it.

1331
01:34:30,228 --> 01:34:31,563
I'm sorry.

1332
01:34:33,023 --> 01:34:35,233
"Sorry" don't get it done, Dude.

1333
01:34:35,692 --> 01:34:39,029
That's the second time you hit me.
Don't ever do it again.

1334
01:34:41,114 --> 01:34:42,616
Maybe you're right.

1335
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:45,911
Maybe you aren't much good anymore.

1336
01:34:50,749 --> 01:34:52,417
Here are your guns.

1337
01:34:53,794 --> 01:34:56,421
Fellow that took your hat
must have left this.

1338
01:34:56,505 --> 01:34:58,465
You get something out of it.

1339
01:34:59,466 --> 01:35:03,595
Now come on down to the jail, and
I'll give you the money you got coming.

1340
01:35:09,726 --> 01:35:11,561
I think this is your horse.

1341
01:35:11,645 --> 01:35:13,522
Yeah, that's mine. Thanks.

1342
01:35:14,356 --> 01:35:16,066
I guess Dude's all right.

1343
01:35:16,149 --> 01:35:17,526
Anyway, he's walking.

1344
01:35:17,609 --> 01:35:18,986
I'm so glad.

1345
01:35:19,444 --> 01:35:20,904
I was afraid.

1346
01:35:22,197 --> 01:35:23,448
My stomach seems...

1347
01:35:23,532 --> 01:35:25,826
Come on, maybe a drink will help.

1348
01:35:39,589 --> 01:35:42,301
Go on up to the jail and wait for me there.

1349
01:35:43,885 --> 01:35:46,179
Tell Stumpy to give you a drink.

1350
01:35:53,437 --> 01:35:56,690
What do you wish me to do
with this three dead men?

1351
01:35:56,857 --> 01:35:59,234
You're the undertaker, Bert. Bury them.

1352
01:35:59,401 --> 01:36:03,447
There's another one down by the bridge.
Send in your bill and the county'll pay you.

1353
01:36:03,530 --> 01:36:04,615
No need for that.

1354
01:36:04,698 --> 01:36:08,368
Each one of them had two new $50
gold pieces in his pocket.

1355
01:36:08,452 --> 01:36:09,786
Price is going up.

1356
01:36:09,870 --> 01:36:10,954
What?

1357
01:36:11,038 --> 01:36:12,372
Nothing, Bert.

1358
01:36:12,623 --> 01:36:15,083
Bring their guns and other stuff to the jail.

1359
01:36:15,208 --> 01:36:16,293
It will be done.

1360
01:36:16,418 --> 01:36:18,086
Here is your gun.

1361
01:36:18,170 --> 01:36:19,921
Thank you, Carlitos.

1362
01:36:20,422 --> 01:36:21,757
Where's Colorado?

1363
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:24,051
He's inside the hotel.
He took the girl Feathers.

1364
01:36:26,553 --> 01:36:28,764
Better give me another, Colorado.

1365
01:36:29,222 --> 01:36:30,307
Yes, ma'am.

1366
01:36:30,390 --> 01:36:33,727
Look at me, Colorado, take a good look.

1367
01:36:34,353 --> 01:36:37,689
Would you say my head is soft?
Would you say I'm an idiot?

1368
01:36:38,315 --> 01:36:39,399
No, ma'am.

1369
01:36:39,983 --> 01:36:41,777
You'd be a liar then.

1370
01:36:43,195 --> 01:36:44,988
Better go easy on that stuff.

1371
01:36:45,072 --> 01:36:47,199
- That makes three you've had.
- Yep.

1372
01:36:47,658 --> 01:36:50,202
You'd be lying because that's what I am.

1373
01:36:50,369 --> 01:36:52,079
A softheaded idiot.

1374
01:36:52,412 --> 01:36:56,083
There isn't any other explanation
for staying around here...

1375
01:36:56,249 --> 01:36:59,086
...and inviting myself into this.
He told me...

1376
01:37:03,340 --> 01:37:04,257
Hi, Sheriff.

1377
01:37:04,383 --> 01:37:07,177
We saw you coming back.
Dude was all right, wasn't he?

1378
01:37:07,260 --> 01:37:10,514
He's all right. So am I, thanks to you.

1379
01:37:11,223 --> 01:37:15,310
- Thank the lady here.
- Sure, thank the lady. She did a big thing.

1380
01:37:15,394 --> 01:37:19,564
She threw a flowerpot through the window
and helped get three men killed.

1381
01:37:19,856 --> 01:37:21,400
Or was it four?

1382
01:37:21,692 --> 01:37:23,193
Why did you make me do it?

1383
01:37:23,277 --> 01:37:26,113
- I made you do it?
- Sure, you did. Didn't he, Colorado?

1384
01:37:26,196 --> 01:37:28,323
He wasn't going to do
what those men told him.

1385
01:37:28,448 --> 01:37:29,700
Not him.

1386
01:37:30,117 --> 01:37:33,453
You were just going to get yourself killed,
that's all.

1387
01:37:33,954 --> 01:37:35,122
Somebody had to...

1388
01:37:35,205 --> 01:37:36,915
What were you going to do, Sheriff?

1389
01:37:36,999 --> 01:37:39,209
I'm glad I didn't have to make up my mind.

1390
01:37:39,334 --> 01:37:42,045
You weren't going down to that jail.

1391
01:37:42,129 --> 01:37:44,006
So somebody had to help you.

1392
01:37:44,089 --> 01:37:46,800
But you don't want anybody to do that,
do you?

1393
01:37:47,718 --> 01:37:50,554
You're right, you didn't make me help you.

1394
01:37:50,929 --> 01:37:52,639
It was my own idea.

1395
01:37:52,848 --> 01:37:55,976
It was my idea to stay.
You told me to get on that stage.

1396
01:37:56,059 --> 01:37:57,728
I know you did.

1397
01:37:57,811 --> 01:37:59,062
I'm glad you didn't.

1398
01:37:59,146 --> 01:38:00,230
What?

1399
01:38:00,355 --> 01:38:02,065
I'm glad you didn't go.

1400
01:38:06,486 --> 01:38:09,114
What'd you have to say a thing
like that for?

1401
01:38:09,239 --> 01:38:13,869
You know, just when we get one thing
settled you have to go bring up another.

1402
01:38:15,329 --> 01:38:17,789
You just don't make any sense, that's all.

1403
01:38:17,914 --> 01:38:19,541
And neither do I.

1404
01:38:19,833 --> 01:38:23,003
And neither do you, Colorado.
What're you doing in this?

1405
01:38:23,128 --> 01:38:25,505
You don't have the excuse that I have.

1406
01:38:30,594 --> 01:38:33,430
I better go before I make a fool of myself.

1407
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:38,644
I don't know why I should go, though,
because we're all fools.

1408
01:38:38,894 --> 01:38:41,939
We ought to get along very well together,
all of us.

1409
01:38:43,357 --> 01:38:45,025
I'm going, anyway.

1410
01:38:45,525 --> 01:38:48,070
We're just a bunch of idiots, that's all.

1411
01:38:48,195 --> 01:38:50,489
Just a bunch of idiots.

1412
01:38:52,532 --> 01:38:54,660
How did she get mixed up in this?

1413
01:38:55,202 --> 01:38:56,954
She didn't feel too good.

1414
01:38:57,120 --> 01:39:00,874
- She had a couple of drinks.
- I don't mean this. I mean out there.

1415
01:39:01,375 --> 01:39:05,629
She was going outside to help you.
How, I don't know. And neither did she.

1416
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:10,676
I told her to throw that pot through
the window and I went out instead.

1417
01:39:10,759 --> 01:39:13,512
And that's your reason
for throwing in with me.

1418
01:39:13,762 --> 01:39:15,806
She's right. It doesn't make any sense.

1419
01:39:15,889 --> 01:39:18,350
Wheeler just talked about helping me.

1420
01:39:18,475 --> 01:39:20,352
But you saved my neck.

1421
01:39:20,477 --> 01:39:23,105
Burdette isn't going to kiss you for that.

1422
01:39:23,230 --> 01:39:24,564
So you're in.

1423
01:39:25,524 --> 01:39:29,444
Don't tell me you didn't think about that.
Before you did it, I mean.

1424
01:39:29,653 --> 01:39:32,489
If I'm going to get shot at,
I might as well get paid for it.

1425
01:39:32,572 --> 01:39:34,366
How do I get a badge?

1426
01:39:34,658 --> 01:39:36,451
Come on, I'll get you one.

1427
01:39:37,411 --> 01:39:40,497
I ought to tell you. Dude's quitting.

1428
01:39:41,915 --> 01:39:45,752
I'm sorry for that.
But I figure why is not my business.

1429
01:39:46,503 --> 01:39:50,007
You've got peculiar ways of choosing
what is your business.

1430
01:39:53,510 --> 01:39:57,806
You telling me they was going to bring
Chance in here to make me turn Joe loose?

1431
01:39:57,931 --> 01:39:59,308
Why, they're crazy.

1432
01:39:59,433 --> 01:40:00,767
God darn fools.

1433
01:40:00,851 --> 01:40:03,854
Chance brings in three strangers,
tells me to unlock the door...

1434
01:40:03,937 --> 01:40:07,608
...what do they think I'm going to do?
You know what I'm going to do.

1435
01:40:08,025 --> 01:40:09,985
I'm going to start blasting.

1436
01:40:11,111 --> 01:40:12,613
Where'd you get that hat?

1437
01:40:12,696 --> 01:40:14,823
Chance gave it to me. For a souvenir.

1438
01:40:14,906 --> 01:40:15,741
For a what?

1439
01:40:15,824 --> 01:40:18,368
- Stumpy, we're coming in.
- Well, come ahead.

1440
01:40:18,452 --> 01:40:20,495
See, he ain't too proud to yell.

1441
01:40:23,415 --> 01:40:26,376
Stumpy, where do you keep
the deputy sheriff badges?

1442
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:28,587
In the right-hand drawer there.

1443
01:40:28,754 --> 01:40:31,214
You know where that book is,
the one with the oath?

1444
01:40:31,298 --> 01:40:34,885
No! If you can't take care of your own
truck don't look for me to do it.

1445
01:40:34,968 --> 01:40:37,846
We'll have to do without it.
Raise your right hand.

1446
01:40:37,929 --> 01:40:41,183
Do you solemnly swear to take
on the duties of a sheriff's deputy...

1447
01:40:41,266 --> 01:40:44,394
Found yourself another knot-head
who don't know when he's well off?

1448
01:40:44,478 --> 01:40:47,481
...in the County of Presidio
of the great State of Texas?

1449
01:40:47,564 --> 01:40:48,649
I do.

1450
01:40:48,982 --> 01:40:51,526
And that includes taking orders from me.

1451
01:40:51,944 --> 01:40:54,571
All right, Sheriff.
How about giving me one.

1452
01:40:54,655 --> 01:40:56,949
Get over to the hotel
and pick up your stuff.

1453
01:40:57,074 --> 01:40:58,533
Move in here.

1454
01:40:59,201 --> 01:41:00,911
What are you laughing about?

1455
01:41:00,994 --> 01:41:02,871
What I got myself in for.

1456
01:41:04,623 --> 01:41:06,500
Cheerful about it anyways, ain't he?

1457
01:41:06,583 --> 01:41:09,044
- How good do you think he is?
- He's all right.

1458
01:41:09,127 --> 01:41:11,421
You think he's as good
as Wheeler said he was?

1459
01:41:11,505 --> 01:41:14,758
He threw me my gun and while it was
in the air, he got one of them.

1460
01:41:14,841 --> 01:41:17,386
- Then he got another one.
- Good enough.

1461
01:41:17,594 --> 01:41:19,638
Is he as good as I used to be?

1462
01:41:22,557 --> 01:41:24,309
It'd be pretty close.

1463
01:41:24,393 --> 01:41:27,020
I'd hate to have to live on the difference.

1464
01:41:28,730 --> 01:41:32,317
Then you got the best of it. Him for me.

1465
01:41:34,444 --> 01:41:36,488
What's he talking about, him for me?

1466
01:41:36,571 --> 01:41:39,283
Nobody never tells me
nothing around here.

1467
01:41:39,366 --> 01:41:40,867
He's quitting.

1468
01:41:43,537 --> 01:41:45,080
What's got into you?

1469
01:41:45,205 --> 01:41:47,666
Look at me. Ain't that pretty?

1470
01:41:48,208 --> 01:41:49,835
Shaking worse all the time.

1471
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:52,963
What can a man do with hands like that?
Tell me, what?

1472
01:41:53,046 --> 01:41:56,883
Take a drink! You said Chance told you to.
You did, didn't you, Chance?

1473
01:41:57,009 --> 01:41:58,969
He can take the whole bottle.

1474
01:41:59,052 --> 01:42:00,595
Go ahead.

1475
01:42:26,121 --> 01:42:27,122
Stumpy.

1476
01:42:29,249 --> 01:42:30,584
Don't close it.

1477
01:42:51,813 --> 01:42:53,357
Didn't spill a drop.

1478
01:42:57,110 --> 01:42:58,695
Shakes are gone...

1479
01:42:59,446 --> 01:43:01,657
...just because of a piece of music.

1480
01:43:03,784 --> 01:43:07,704
Till they played that piece,
I forgot how I got into this thing.

1481
01:43:09,498 --> 01:43:12,918
Keep on playing it,
I don't think I'll ever forget again.

1482
01:43:13,794 --> 01:43:17,130
Chance, give me another shot at it...

1483
01:43:18,465 --> 01:43:20,676
...Stumpy can take the bottle away.

1484
01:43:25,389 --> 01:43:26,640
You heard him.

1485
01:43:29,309 --> 01:43:32,980
Bring it out, put it back.
Nobody ever asks me if I need a drink.

1486
01:43:33,689 --> 01:43:36,233
I ain't going to wait for them to ask me,
because I do.

1487
01:43:36,316 --> 01:43:38,694
You two are enough to drive a man to it.

1488
01:43:41,822 --> 01:43:44,116
I think I'll go watch the road again.

1489
01:43:44,992 --> 01:43:47,369
Unless you need me for something else.

1490
01:43:48,912 --> 01:43:50,664
Did you forget this?

1491
01:43:52,291 --> 01:43:53,792
You could clean up a little.

1492
01:43:53,875 --> 01:43:56,420
Yeah, you're a heck of a looking deputy.

1493
01:43:57,170 --> 01:43:58,922
I'm better than I look.

1494
01:43:59,381 --> 01:44:01,008
I'll do that tonight.

1495
01:44:01,091 --> 01:44:05,178
If you think of it, send me some food.
I think I could eat something.

1496
01:44:07,931 --> 01:44:09,891
Nothing in his stomach.

1497
01:44:10,142 --> 01:44:11,602
Nothing but guts.

1498
01:44:12,269 --> 01:44:15,272
You can quit worrying about him
and start thinking about me.

1499
01:44:15,355 --> 01:44:18,108
We know about him,
he's going to be all right, but I ain't.

1500
01:44:18,191 --> 01:44:21,111
That got my goat.
I can't watch a man get down.

1501
01:44:21,194 --> 01:44:22,738
Where're you going?

1502
01:44:23,322 --> 01:44:25,949
To get Dude something to eat.
And you'd better...

1503
01:44:26,033 --> 01:44:28,076
I know, get back in my hole.

1504
01:44:28,201 --> 01:44:31,538
No, you'd better watch out for Colorado
when he comes back.

1505
01:44:31,622 --> 01:44:34,458
I forgot to tell him
how trigger-happy you are.

1506
01:44:34,708 --> 01:44:39,004
We get a good man, he has to watch you
to keep from getting shot full of holes.

1507
01:44:39,087 --> 01:44:40,714
Close the window!

1508
01:44:41,923 --> 01:44:45,135
Still talking about that little accident
last night.

1509
01:44:45,385 --> 01:44:48,013
Never can satisfy him.

1510
01:47:00,020 --> 01:47:02,147
That's real pretty. Go on, play some more.

1511
01:47:02,230 --> 01:47:04,066
Why don't you play something
I can sing with you?

1512
01:47:12,783 --> 01:47:13,700
Good one.

1513
01:48:21,727 --> 01:48:23,604
That's nice. Ain't it, Chance?

1514
01:48:23,729 --> 01:48:26,690
It's better than being out
in the street and getting shot at.

1515
01:48:26,773 --> 01:48:28,483
I can't argue with you.

1516
01:48:28,609 --> 01:48:30,652
- You're right, Stumpy.
- Right about what?

1517
01:48:30,777 --> 01:48:34,114
- I should have thought of it before.
- Thought about what?

1518
01:48:34,281 --> 01:48:38,035
Burdette's shown his hand.
He isn't going to rush this jail.

1519
01:48:38,118 --> 01:48:40,412
Everything he's tried has been outside.

1520
01:48:40,495 --> 01:48:42,873
We could sit here and wait for the marshal.

1521
01:48:42,956 --> 01:48:44,791
Only be three or four days.

1522
01:48:45,250 --> 01:48:47,878
How much food you got, Stumpy?
Enough for all of us?

1523
01:48:47,961 --> 01:48:49,921
Yeah, if you can eat what I eat.

1524
01:48:50,005 --> 01:48:52,382
- Water and firewood?
- Filled up this morning.

1525
01:48:52,466 --> 01:48:55,677
We do need some blankets and tobacco,
and matches.

1526
01:48:55,761 --> 01:48:58,305
- Less you got plenty.
- He ain't.

1527
01:48:58,472 --> 01:49:01,016
- And a few bottles of beer, Dude?
- Thanks, Stumpy.

1528
01:49:01,141 --> 01:49:02,809
There's another thing now...

1529
01:49:02,893 --> 01:49:07,105
...if we're all going to be in here
three or four days, close together like...

1530
01:49:07,314 --> 01:49:11,652
...it might be a good idea if a certain
party, not to mention no names was to...

1531
01:49:11,735 --> 01:49:13,278
...do what he said he'd do.

1532
01:49:13,362 --> 01:49:17,115
A horse barn's a good place but it ain't
a place for a fellow to roll around in.

1533
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:18,325
All right, Stumpy.

1534
01:49:18,408 --> 01:49:22,245
Me, I like roses, but this fellow
ain't no rose this fellow I'm talking about.

1535
01:49:22,371 --> 01:49:24,831
I'm going to take a bath. I said I would.

1536
01:49:24,957 --> 01:49:27,668
Dude, I never had no idea you wouldn't.

1537
01:49:27,918 --> 01:49:29,878
I was just a wondering when.

1538
01:49:30,003 --> 01:49:32,464
He'll keep talking till we get out of here.

1539
01:49:32,589 --> 01:49:35,133
I'll take a bath
while you gather up the stuff.

1540
01:49:35,217 --> 01:49:38,887
Yell when you get back, because
you look different when you're clean.

1541
01:49:42,349 --> 01:49:43,767
How you do that?

1542
01:49:43,850 --> 01:49:46,603
It's easy, Carlos.
You just weren't watching.

1543
01:49:47,688 --> 01:49:49,022
Carlos, open up.

1544
01:49:49,147 --> 01:49:50,148
Coming.

1545
01:49:52,567 --> 01:49:56,154
Buenas tardes, Señor Chance.
I think it is best to lock the door.

1546
01:49:57,072 --> 01:50:00,325
Carlos, I'm sleeping over at the jail tonight.
All of us are.

1547
01:50:00,409 --> 01:50:03,912
We'll need some blankets,
plenty of tobacco, and matches.

1548
01:50:04,413 --> 01:50:06,623
- And some beer, too.
- Feeling better?

1549
01:50:06,707 --> 01:50:07,791
Much better.

1550
01:50:07,874 --> 01:50:10,002
- That's all you need?
- That's all.

1551
01:50:10,085 --> 01:50:14,256
When you get the stuff together,
let us know. I'll be upstairs.

1552
01:50:18,719 --> 01:50:20,595
Now don't make any noise.

1553
01:50:23,390 --> 01:50:24,766
Open your mouth.

1554
01:50:50,459 --> 01:50:51,835
Hi, Feathers.

1555
01:50:51,918 --> 01:50:54,212
Have you got any soap
that smells like roses?

1556
01:50:54,338 --> 01:50:57,007
I have some soap,
but it doesn't smell like a rose.

1557
01:50:57,090 --> 01:50:59,801
Won't do. Won't do. Stumpy likes roses.

1558
01:51:00,594 --> 01:51:01,762
Who's Stumpy?

1559
01:51:01,887 --> 01:51:03,764
The fellow that likes roses.

1560
01:51:03,930 --> 01:51:05,724
No, he watches the jail.

1561
01:51:05,807 --> 01:51:06,725
Hurry it up.

1562
01:51:06,850 --> 01:51:07,935
Right away.

1563
01:51:08,060 --> 01:51:11,146
Yeah, what's all this
about moving down to the jail?

1564
01:51:11,772 --> 01:51:14,775
Something I should have done
two or three days ago.

1565
01:51:14,858 --> 01:51:16,610
Are you sorry you didn't?

1566
01:51:18,070 --> 01:51:19,237
Are you?

1567
01:51:19,947 --> 01:51:22,074
I know an easy way of telling you.

1568
01:51:24,576 --> 01:51:26,787
Can't you talk plainer than that?

1569
01:51:27,329 --> 01:51:28,830
Chance, give me a towel.

1570
01:51:28,914 --> 01:51:29,831
I'm busy.

1571
01:51:29,957 --> 01:51:31,124
What'd you say?

1572
01:51:31,208 --> 01:51:33,001
Somebody's telling me something.

1573
01:51:33,085 --> 01:51:36,213
I can't... Give me a towel, will you?

1574
01:51:38,173 --> 01:51:39,800
He's a big help.

1575
01:51:40,008 --> 01:51:42,052
I'll finish telling you later.

1576
01:51:50,519 --> 01:51:52,229
The Dude went in to take a bath.

1577
01:51:52,312 --> 01:51:54,856
I couldn't see,
but I don't think he has his guns.

1578
01:51:54,982 --> 01:51:58,318
The sheriff's upstairs talking to the girl.
He has his gun.

1579
01:51:58,527 --> 01:52:00,487
I don't want to go up and get him.

1580
01:52:00,570 --> 01:52:03,282
- Burdette wants him alive.
- Then don't talk so loud.

1581
01:52:03,365 --> 01:52:06,618
He'll come charging here with that rifle
and we'll have to kill him.

1582
01:52:06,743 --> 01:52:09,037
- That might just work.
- What?

1583
01:52:09,746 --> 01:52:11,415
The stairs are pretty dark.

1584
01:52:11,498 --> 01:52:14,167
We stretch a rope across them.
Let him hear something.

1585
01:52:14,251 --> 01:52:17,504
Give me that piece of rope.
Come on, give me a hand.

1586
01:52:35,689 --> 01:52:37,107
Hurry it up, will you?

1587
01:52:37,190 --> 01:52:38,525
Be right out.

1588
01:52:41,194 --> 01:52:43,864
If you're leaving,
I might as well get some sleep.

1589
01:52:43,947 --> 01:52:46,867
I don't suppose I could come by
the jail once in a while...

1590
01:52:46,950 --> 01:52:50,787
...and see if you needed anything.
- I don't want you anyplace around there.

1591
01:52:51,371 --> 01:52:52,956
I was afraid of that.

1592
01:52:53,707 --> 01:52:56,627
That means I won't see you
for three or four days.

1593
01:52:57,294 --> 01:52:59,254
That's a long time, you know.

1594
01:53:00,380 --> 01:53:02,132
You'll live through it.

1595
01:53:03,550 --> 01:53:05,218
Yeah, you do the same.

1596
01:53:16,730 --> 01:53:20,067
All right, you both better get out there.
You, too, Pedro.

1597
01:53:20,317 --> 01:53:22,277
Leave the door open a little.

1598
01:53:22,569 --> 01:53:24,529
Get the gag out of her mouth.

1599
01:53:25,656 --> 01:53:28,825
Now, lady,
we want you to call the sheriff down here.

1600
01:53:29,242 --> 01:53:30,702
No! No!

1601
01:53:31,453 --> 01:53:32,996
Maybe this'll help.

1602
01:53:33,413 --> 01:53:35,791
Please don't. Don't!

1603
01:53:43,882 --> 01:53:46,176
He's out cold. Get upstairs, quick!

1604
01:53:49,262 --> 01:53:50,514
Hold it, Dude.

1605
01:53:50,931 --> 01:53:52,099
Watch him.

1606
01:53:55,269 --> 01:53:57,020
Just keep coming, lady.

1607
01:53:57,896 --> 01:54:00,023
All right, everybody, downstairs.

1608
01:54:08,782 --> 01:54:10,909
All right, get on your feet.

1609
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,418
Come on, get up!

1610
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:28,051
Can you walk?

1611
01:54:30,304 --> 01:54:31,680
Where're we going?

1612
01:54:31,763 --> 01:54:32,931
That's up to you.

1613
01:54:33,056 --> 01:54:35,017
We go to the jail and you let Joe go.

1614
01:54:35,142 --> 01:54:37,686
Or we tuck you two away
and make a trade with Stumpy.

1615
01:54:37,769 --> 01:54:38,854
Take your choice.

1616
01:54:38,979 --> 01:54:41,273
You won't make any deal with Stumpy.

1617
01:54:41,815 --> 01:54:44,901
- You'll just get Joe killed.
- Not if he knows we got you two.

1618
01:54:44,985 --> 01:54:47,029
They got us. We're licked.

1619
01:54:47,112 --> 01:54:50,699
Go on, take them over to the jail,
and tell Stumpy to open up and let Joe go.

1620
01:54:50,824 --> 01:54:53,619
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'm telling you to do it now.

1621
01:54:53,702 --> 01:54:57,205
Stumpy couldn't hold out. He hasn't got
water or food and he's all alone.

1622
01:54:57,331 --> 01:54:59,708
Nobody to get him any water.
Now go on, do it.

1623
01:54:59,791 --> 01:55:01,752
- Do you know what you're saying?
- I do.

1624
01:55:01,835 --> 01:55:04,588
I'm thinking good, too.
Now do what I tell you.

1625
01:55:06,256 --> 01:55:08,383
And then after they get Joe,
what happens?

1626
01:55:08,508 --> 01:55:10,260
All we want is Joe.

1627
01:55:13,347 --> 01:55:16,850
- You still think it's a good idea?
- I still think it's good.

1628
01:55:19,269 --> 01:55:20,771
We'll go over to the jail.

1629
01:55:20,854 --> 01:55:22,522
Take the shells out of his gun.

1630
01:55:22,606 --> 01:55:24,107
I unloaded his pistol.

1631
01:55:24,191 --> 01:55:26,568
Steve, you and Harry come along with me.

1632
01:55:26,693 --> 01:55:29,905
Now look, Sheriff,
we're going out of here natural like.

1633
01:55:30,572 --> 01:55:33,325
You carry your gun
and don't do anything to make anybody...

1634
01:55:33,408 --> 01:55:35,285
...think something is wrong.

1635
01:55:35,369 --> 01:55:39,122
If you have to explain to Stumpy,
tell him we put up bail for Joe.

1636
01:55:39,706 --> 01:55:42,417
Burdette's got it figured out pretty good.

1637
01:55:42,542 --> 01:55:46,129
If it was up to me,
you'd have never got up off the floor.

1638
01:55:46,672 --> 01:55:49,383
Some of those you killed
were friends of mine.

1639
01:55:49,591 --> 01:55:51,093
Give him his rifle.

1640
01:55:54,096 --> 01:55:55,180
You first.

1641
01:56:32,634 --> 01:56:33,885
Hold it.

1642
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:38,473
Yell to Stumpy you're coming in.
We've been watching you.

1643
01:56:40,350 --> 01:56:42,185
Stumpy, this is Chance.

1644
01:56:42,269 --> 01:56:43,854
It took you long enough.

1645
01:56:43,937 --> 01:56:46,064
Steve, cover from out here.

1646
01:56:54,114 --> 01:56:57,326
All right, open up.
We're going to let Joe go.

1647
01:56:57,451 --> 01:56:58,702
How come?

1648
01:56:59,494 --> 01:57:01,705
His friends here put up bail.

1649
01:57:02,289 --> 01:57:05,208
Give me the keys then.
They're on your desk there.

1650
01:57:06,293 --> 01:57:07,544
I forgot.

1651
01:57:17,471 --> 01:57:18,472
Easy.

1652
01:57:18,555 --> 01:57:21,808
- This fellow will talk all right.
- Watch him. I'm going after Dude.

1653
01:57:21,892 --> 01:57:24,353
You go along with him. I'll watch him.

1654
01:57:27,314 --> 01:57:28,774
Now watch yourself.

1655
01:57:28,857 --> 01:57:31,068
There's two of them holding Dude.

1656
01:57:33,487 --> 01:57:34,655
The window.

1657
01:57:46,583 --> 01:57:48,335
All right, Colorado.

1658
01:57:56,593 --> 01:57:58,470
In here.

1659
01:57:59,096 --> 01:58:00,097
They're gone.

1660
01:58:00,180 --> 01:58:02,474
They took Dude
when they heard the shooting.

1661
01:58:02,599 --> 01:58:06,103
They went out the back door.
They had horses. I heard them.

1662
01:58:09,022 --> 01:58:10,774
They've gone all right.

1663
01:58:12,025 --> 01:58:13,860
We going to go after them?

1664
01:58:15,070 --> 01:58:20,200
I told Nathan Burdette what'd happen
if he came after his brother.

1665
01:58:21,535 --> 01:58:23,245
You ought to remember that.

1666
01:58:23,328 --> 01:58:25,038
You thought it was funny.

1667
01:58:25,122 --> 01:58:28,000
What do you think he'd do
if we went after Dude?

1668
01:58:28,292 --> 01:58:29,543
I didn't think.

1669
01:58:29,876 --> 01:58:32,087
Think the shoe's on the other foot now.

1670
01:58:32,212 --> 01:58:34,923
The men who took Dude,
they were very angry.

1671
01:58:35,215 --> 01:58:37,259
They say Dude set a trap for them.

1672
01:58:37,384 --> 01:58:39,594
He sent them over there, all right.

1673
01:58:39,886 --> 01:58:43,223
He knew what he was doing.
Knew what Stumpy would do, too.

1674
01:58:44,266 --> 01:58:46,226
That's why they're not happy about it.

1675
01:58:46,351 --> 01:58:47,603
What're you going to do?

1676
01:58:47,728 --> 01:58:49,688
It's what Burdette will do.

1677
01:58:50,689 --> 01:58:52,983
Carlos. Get a hold of Burdette.

1678
01:58:53,734 --> 01:58:56,570
I don't care how.
Tell him I want to talk to him.

1679
01:58:56,653 --> 01:59:00,324
Tell him to set the time and the place.
But I want to talk to him.

1680
01:59:00,449 --> 01:59:02,409
We'll be at the jail.

1681
01:59:07,831 --> 01:59:10,709
Aren't you sorry now
you didn't get on the stage?

1682
01:59:16,214 --> 01:59:17,674
Come on, Colorado.

1683
01:59:17,924 --> 01:59:20,135
Let's wake up the Chinaman again.

1684
01:59:49,915 --> 01:59:52,125
It's me, Carlos.

1685
01:59:56,797 --> 01:59:58,674
What's the matter? What'd he say?

1686
01:59:58,799 --> 02:00:00,634
He say he don't want to talk to you.

1687
02:00:00,717 --> 02:00:03,637
He say if you want Dude back,
he'll make a trade.

1688
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:04,554
A trade?

1689
02:00:04,638 --> 02:00:05,806
Dude for Joe.

1690
02:00:05,931 --> 02:00:08,308
He'll be in his place over by the creek.

1691
02:00:08,433 --> 02:00:09,268
Warehouse?

1692
02:00:09,393 --> 02:00:10,060
Si.

1693
02:00:10,143 --> 02:00:12,354
He'll be there half an hour after sunup.

1694
02:00:12,479 --> 02:00:16,066
He'll have Dude.
If you'll bring Joe, he'll be waiting.

1695
02:00:16,149 --> 02:00:17,859
He said to let him know.

1696
02:00:23,198 --> 02:00:24,700
Tell him we'll be there.

1697
02:00:24,783 --> 02:00:27,244
You're crazy! You can't do that!

1698
02:00:27,369 --> 02:00:29,579
Not even if Dude was your own brother.

1699
02:00:29,663 --> 02:00:30,580
What can I do?

1700
02:00:30,706 --> 02:00:34,126
What we figured on doing.
Hole up till the marshal comes.

1701
02:00:34,251 --> 02:00:37,087
When the marshal takes Joe,
what'll happen to Dude?

1702
02:00:37,170 --> 02:00:40,132
Dude knew what he was in for
when he sent you over here.

1703
02:00:40,215 --> 02:00:42,884
I'd like to add my two cents worth, Sheriff.

1704
02:00:43,176 --> 02:00:44,094
Go ahead.

1705
02:00:44,219 --> 02:00:46,847
From what I hear,
you and Dude are the only witnesses.

1706
02:00:46,930 --> 02:00:49,308
Let's say that we're the only ones
that'll talk.

1707
02:00:49,391 --> 02:00:52,269
After Nathan gets Joe back,
he's still got to live here.

1708
02:00:52,352 --> 02:00:56,398
Which means you two can't, and
if you don't have Joe, what'll stop him?

1709
02:00:56,481 --> 02:00:57,941
The brakes'll be off then.

1710
02:00:58,025 --> 02:01:00,319
That ought to be as plain
as the nose on your face.

1711
02:01:00,444 --> 02:01:02,237
You're right, Colorado.

1712
02:01:02,821 --> 02:01:04,948
But you and Stumpy didn't see the killing.

1713
02:01:05,032 --> 02:01:07,159
I don't think he'll bother you two.

1714
02:01:07,284 --> 02:01:08,869
- I'm not worried.
- Me neither.

1715
02:01:08,952 --> 02:01:11,079
You'll just wait for the marshal to come.

1716
02:01:11,163 --> 02:01:13,957
- He's still going to want you and Dude.
- I'd say so.

1717
02:01:14,041 --> 02:01:16,793
You can't get out of town
because he's got it bottled up.

1718
02:01:16,877 --> 02:01:20,088
When you make the trade
then Burdette's going to get both of you.

1719
02:01:20,172 --> 02:01:21,965
After a little argument.

1720
02:01:22,049 --> 02:01:25,719
- But why at all? Why the both of you?
- Dude ought to have a chance.

1721
02:01:25,886 --> 02:01:28,597
He won't get one the other way. Will he?

1722
02:01:28,930 --> 02:01:30,182
Will he?

1723
02:01:31,016 --> 02:01:32,893
You're going to have me crying.

1724
02:01:33,060 --> 02:01:37,856
Fellow's got to be a drunk to get anywhere
around here. I might as well start now.

1725
02:01:40,025 --> 02:01:41,485
Go ahead, Carlos.

1726
02:02:00,087 --> 02:02:01,505
Burdette's here.

1727
02:02:04,341 --> 02:02:05,801
About time to go.

1728
02:02:06,176 --> 02:02:08,804
How about I go ahead,
see if they'll play any tricks?

1729
02:02:08,887 --> 02:02:10,389
Look out here.

1730
02:02:11,264 --> 02:02:13,392
We're drawing quite a crowd.

1731
02:02:13,600 --> 02:02:17,354
There won't be any tricks.
At least not till we make the trade.

1732
02:02:17,562 --> 02:02:19,606
Besides, you're not going.

1733
02:02:19,815 --> 02:02:23,026
When you decided to make the trade
for Dude, I went along with you.

1734
02:02:23,110 --> 02:02:24,653
I'm going along now.

1735
02:02:24,820 --> 02:02:25,904
Why?

1736
02:02:26,905 --> 02:02:28,949
Just say I'd like a closer look.

1737
02:02:32,369 --> 02:02:35,289
Up to now I thought you were smart.
Stumpy, you're not going.

1738
02:02:35,372 --> 02:02:38,375
Why ain't I going?
Give me one good reason why?

1739
02:02:39,042 --> 02:02:40,210
I'll give you one.

1740
02:02:40,294 --> 02:02:44,339
You've done a good job in here because
you haven't had to move around much.

1741
02:02:44,423 --> 02:02:48,343
But out there if anything happens,
you'll have to move, and move fast.

1742
02:02:48,468 --> 02:02:50,762
I'd feel better if you weren't there.

1743
02:02:51,638 --> 02:02:54,766
It's plain enough.
Old cripples ain't wanted.

1744
02:02:56,852 --> 02:02:58,604
You give me a reason.

1745
02:03:02,524 --> 02:03:07,738
Do you want that I should bring Joe out,
or do you want to do that yourself?

1746
02:03:08,155 --> 02:03:09,656
Bring him out.

1747
02:03:17,164 --> 02:03:20,208
I think I'll take along a rifle,
some extra shells.

1748
02:03:29,343 --> 02:03:31,386
I told you I'd get out of here.

1749
02:03:31,720 --> 02:03:34,723
Open your mouth again
and we'll carry you out.

1750
02:03:36,016 --> 02:03:37,643
See you, Stumpy.

1751
02:03:43,398 --> 02:03:44,399
See you.

1752
02:04:36,743 --> 02:04:38,453
That's far enough, Joe.

1753
02:04:43,709 --> 02:04:45,168
Through the barn.

1754
02:04:57,180 --> 02:05:01,226
Just sit down over there
on those grain sacks.

1755
02:05:24,875 --> 02:05:26,585
You want a closer look?

1756
02:05:27,461 --> 02:05:29,254
This is close enough.

1757
02:05:29,755 --> 02:05:31,214
Take that window.

1758
02:05:31,548 --> 02:05:32,883
Watch Joe.

1759
02:05:50,943 --> 02:05:52,110
Burdette!

1760
02:05:55,489 --> 02:05:56,823
Burdette!

1761
02:05:57,240 --> 02:05:58,951
Nathan Burdette!

1762
02:06:04,623 --> 02:06:05,791
We're ready.

1763
02:06:05,958 --> 02:06:07,334
Joe's here.

1764
02:06:07,751 --> 02:06:09,378
We're ready, too.

1765
02:06:10,504 --> 02:06:11,672
Start Dude.

1766
02:06:12,547 --> 02:06:14,341
I'll start Joe.

1767
02:06:14,424 --> 02:06:15,676
Go ahead.

1768
02:06:19,930 --> 02:06:21,473
All right, Joe.

1769
02:06:25,060 --> 02:06:27,354
You can start walking very slow.

1770
02:06:29,106 --> 02:06:31,233
And stop if I say stop...

1771
02:06:32,567 --> 02:06:34,069
...or I'll stop you.

1772
02:06:34,987 --> 02:06:36,238
Bring him out.

1773
02:06:41,243 --> 02:06:42,494
Go ahead.

1774
02:06:43,328 --> 02:06:44,413
Slow.

1775
02:07:26,246 --> 02:07:27,331
Look out!

1776
02:07:44,556 --> 02:07:46,600
Do you want me to go help Dude?

1777
02:07:46,725 --> 02:07:48,477
He'll take Joe all right.

1778
02:07:50,395 --> 02:07:52,606
He's got a strange way of doing it.

1779
02:07:53,357 --> 02:07:54,358
He'll take him.

1780
02:08:00,322 --> 02:08:01,949
You're right. He did.

1781
02:08:03,075 --> 02:08:06,078
Hey, Chance, I got Joe.

1782
02:08:06,745 --> 02:08:08,705
He can't walk, but I can drag him.

1783
02:08:08,789 --> 02:08:10,624
Stay right where you are.

1784
02:08:10,749 --> 02:08:12,125
We'll throw you a gun.

1785
02:08:12,209 --> 02:08:13,710
I'll do it. I'm closer.

1786
02:08:25,347 --> 02:08:29,017
Wait till we start shooting, Dude,
then make a grab for it.

1787
02:08:29,851 --> 02:08:32,145
Let's make a little noise, Colorado.

1788
02:09:05,220 --> 02:09:06,722
That ought to start something.

1789
02:09:08,015 --> 02:09:09,016
It will.

1790
02:09:11,935 --> 02:09:13,186
On your left!

1791
02:09:17,024 --> 02:09:18,859
Two of them made it to that shack.

1792
02:09:18,942 --> 02:09:21,486
If they get across that creek,
we'll be in bad shape.

1793
02:09:21,570 --> 02:09:22,904
They'll get behind us.

1794
02:09:22,988 --> 02:09:25,782
I don't know how
we're going to stop them from here.

1795
02:09:30,871 --> 02:09:32,331
Is that who I think it is?

1796
02:09:32,414 --> 02:09:33,582
Old Stumpy.

1797
02:09:34,124 --> 02:09:35,876
The fellow I left behind.

1798
02:09:37,461 --> 02:09:39,504
Don't shoot, it's me.

1799
02:09:39,588 --> 02:09:41,715
Carlos, what are you doing here?

1800
02:09:42,049 --> 02:09:44,843
I bring you some more shells.
You might need them.

1801
02:09:44,926 --> 02:09:46,303
Who'll turn up next?

1802
02:09:46,386 --> 02:09:48,764
Maybe the girl with another flowerpot.

1803
02:09:50,390 --> 02:09:54,394
Chance, Stumpy sitting in a bad place.
That wagon's got dynamite in it.

1804
02:09:55,270 --> 02:09:56,813
I go tell him.

1805
02:09:56,897 --> 02:09:59,107
You stay here. I'll go get him.

1806
02:09:59,232 --> 02:10:00,859
Give me those shells.

1807
02:10:27,094 --> 02:10:29,304
Stumpy, get out of there.

1808
02:10:29,805 --> 02:10:32,724
No. Come on, I got a front seat.
It's a good one.

1809
02:10:32,891 --> 02:10:34,518
You got a good seat, all right.

1810
02:10:34,601 --> 02:10:36,728
That's wagon's full of dynamite.

1811
02:10:36,937 --> 02:10:38,647
Jumping Jehoshaphat.

1812
02:10:39,064 --> 02:10:41,108
Why don't nobody never tell me nothing?

1813
02:10:41,233 --> 02:10:44,736
Get away from that wagon
or you won't be around to hear anything.

1814
02:11:02,504 --> 02:11:04,548
Stumpy, hurry up! What are you doing?

1815
02:11:04,673 --> 02:11:07,342
What do you think I'm doing?
Taking a siesta?

1816
02:11:08,760 --> 02:11:10,595
I brought us some dynamite.

1817
02:11:11,096 --> 02:11:12,597
That's a good idea.

1818
02:11:12,723 --> 02:11:15,183
Let's get farther away from that wagon.

1819
02:11:18,979 --> 02:11:21,273
Can you shoot as good as you say you can?

1820
02:11:21,356 --> 02:11:23,817
- Can you throw?
- Near as far as you can shoot.

1821
02:11:23,942 --> 02:11:26,069
We'll find out. Get that box open.

1822
02:11:30,282 --> 02:11:31,199
Dude!

1823
02:11:32,409 --> 02:11:33,827
Over here.

1824
02:11:34,661 --> 02:11:35,746
Get ready.

1825
02:11:35,954 --> 02:11:37,331
Let it go!

1826
02:11:44,004 --> 02:11:45,547
That was a good one.

1827
02:11:46,590 --> 02:11:48,091
Stop cackling.

1828
02:11:48,592 --> 02:11:50,802
Get one a little farther out there.

1829
02:11:50,886 --> 02:11:52,429
There you go again.

1830
02:11:53,180 --> 02:11:55,932
What would you do
if I wasn't throwing them for you?

1831
02:11:56,016 --> 02:11:57,267
I'd throw them myself.

1832
02:11:57,351 --> 02:11:59,811
Yeah, I guess you would at that.
You ready?

1833
02:11:59,978 --> 02:12:01,313
Let it go.

1834
02:12:06,693 --> 02:12:09,154
Dude, how do you like them apples?

1835
02:12:09,488 --> 02:12:10,739
That's all right.

1836
02:12:10,864 --> 02:12:12,324
Throw one for me.

1837
02:12:12,574 --> 02:12:14,618
Go ahead, but throw it harder this time.

1838
02:12:14,701 --> 02:12:16,995
There you go again.
You never can satisfy you.

1839
02:12:17,120 --> 02:12:18,288
Throw it.

1840
02:12:18,372 --> 02:12:19,873
Here you are, Dude.

1841
02:12:26,046 --> 02:12:27,547
Took you two.

1842
02:12:27,798 --> 02:12:29,466
I didn't allow for the wind.

1843
02:12:29,549 --> 02:12:31,843
Can't you throw them any farther?

1844
02:12:31,969 --> 02:12:34,262
I can if you want to blow
the whole place down.

1845
02:12:34,429 --> 02:12:37,307
That's the general idea. Throw it!

1846
02:12:46,233 --> 02:12:48,277
Don't shoot. We've had enough.

1847
02:12:48,443 --> 02:12:50,737
That got them.
That took the fight out of them.

1848
02:12:50,821 --> 02:12:51,738
Look at them quit.

1849
02:13:08,588 --> 02:13:10,382
Sure is quiet out there.

1850
02:13:10,549 --> 02:13:11,633
Find anything?

1851
02:13:11,758 --> 02:13:15,846
There isn't a Burdette man left
in town outside those who got locked up.

1852
02:13:15,929 --> 02:13:18,640
Rest of them all cleared out.
We won't have any trouble.

1853
02:13:18,724 --> 02:13:19,808
You're welcome.

1854
02:13:19,933 --> 02:13:21,101
Thank you.

1855
02:13:22,436 --> 02:13:24,146
What do you want to do about them?

1856
02:13:24,229 --> 02:13:26,857
Want to take them to Presidio
or wait for the marshal?

1857
02:13:26,940 --> 02:13:29,651
- We'll wait for the marshal.
- Wait for the marshal?

1858
02:13:29,735 --> 02:13:33,405
I'm glad you agree, since you have
to cook for them and watch them.

1859
02:13:33,488 --> 02:13:36,575
That ain't the way I said it.
I said, "Wait for the marshal?"

1860
02:13:36,658 --> 02:13:37,909
And that's a question.

1861
02:13:37,993 --> 02:13:40,621
I'm fed up feeding them,
and I ain't going to watch them.

1862
02:13:40,746 --> 02:13:43,790
I've been sitting back there so long
in the dark that I feel...

1863
02:13:43,874 --> 02:13:46,418
...like a gopher or a burrowing owl
or something.

1864
02:13:46,501 --> 02:13:49,212
When I went outside,
couldn't hardly see in the daylight.

1865
02:13:49,296 --> 02:13:51,340
I'll watch it for you if you want to go out.

1866
02:13:51,423 --> 02:13:53,091
- Would you?
- Sure.

1867
02:13:53,175 --> 02:13:56,678
I guess it's dark enough I can go outside,
it wouldn't hurt my eyes none.

1868
02:13:56,803 --> 02:13:58,221
I don't think it would.

1869
02:13:58,305 --> 02:14:02,142
Maybe get myself slicked up a smidge and
have a drink, it wouldn't hurt me either.

1870
02:14:02,225 --> 02:14:03,936
I don't think it would.

1871
02:14:04,853 --> 02:14:06,104
Should I go?

1872
02:14:06,396 --> 02:14:07,397
Go ahead.

1873
02:14:07,981 --> 02:14:08,732
Go ahead.

1874
02:14:08,815 --> 02:14:10,859
- You ain't going to give me a argument?
- No.

1875
02:14:10,984 --> 02:14:13,028
Don't care whether I go or not.

1876
02:14:25,707 --> 02:14:26,792
Chance.

1877
02:14:27,834 --> 02:14:29,795
Have you seen that girl yet?

1878
02:14:30,587 --> 02:14:32,965
I said, "Have you seen that girl yet?"

1879
02:14:35,717 --> 02:14:36,802
The job.

1880
02:14:37,928 --> 02:14:39,346
Didn't have time.

1881
02:14:40,555 --> 02:14:43,684
The Fort Worth stage is in.
They run at night.

1882
02:14:44,059 --> 02:14:45,435
Should be leaving soon.

1883
02:14:45,519 --> 02:14:47,729
- You mean she's going on it?
- I don't know.

1884
02:14:47,854 --> 02:14:49,815
I don't think you do either.

1885
02:14:49,940 --> 02:14:51,900
But if it was me, I'd find out.

1886
02:14:52,025 --> 02:14:54,653
I wouldn't walk around wondering about it.

1887
02:14:55,070 --> 02:14:57,531
She might be leaving and she might not.

1888
02:14:58,073 --> 02:15:00,117
She might need help making up her mind.

1889
02:15:00,242 --> 02:15:01,868
But you're the expert.

1890
02:15:01,952 --> 02:15:04,579
Me, I don't know anything about women.

1891
02:15:05,289 --> 02:15:08,542
Next thing you'll be telling me
you don't remember one.

1892
02:15:12,462 --> 02:15:13,964
A man forgets.

1893
02:15:18,385 --> 02:15:20,345
Sometimes it isn't easy.

1894
02:15:22,389 --> 02:15:25,434
Something happens, he just forgets.

1895
02:15:27,060 --> 02:15:30,314
In case you're interested, I have.

1896
02:15:31,189 --> 02:15:32,983
I don't even want a drink.

1897
02:15:34,109 --> 02:15:35,485
It's about time.

1898
02:15:36,028 --> 02:15:38,655
I was getting awful tired
of taking care of you.

1899
02:15:38,739 --> 02:15:41,742
If you want to jump in, I'll take care of you.

1900
02:15:42,534 --> 02:15:44,828
What is this now?
You're going to take care of him.

1901
02:15:44,953 --> 02:15:47,414
- Tell me about it.
- Sheriff's got himself a girl.

1902
02:15:47,497 --> 02:15:48,582
Shut up.

1903
02:15:48,707 --> 02:15:50,667
We ain't going to go through that again?

1904
02:15:50,751 --> 02:15:52,961
You going to do
the same thing Dude done?

1905
02:15:53,086 --> 02:15:55,839
- Keep still.
- Why don't somebody tell me these things?

1906
02:15:55,922 --> 02:15:57,382
Where you going?

1907
02:15:57,466 --> 02:15:58,967
Let him go, Stumpy.

1908
02:16:01,219 --> 02:16:03,513
No fooling,
has the sheriff got himself a girl?

1909
02:16:03,639 --> 02:16:06,016
I think so, but he doesn't know it yet.

1910
02:16:06,183 --> 02:16:08,894
- She got him on the run?
- She sure has.

1911
02:16:09,811 --> 02:16:11,271
I can just see him.

1912
02:16:11,355 --> 02:16:13,315
Laying down the law to her.

1913
02:16:13,440 --> 02:16:15,817
"I told you to get back in there!"

1914
02:16:16,777 --> 02:16:19,237
And then getting told off himself.

1915
02:16:25,410 --> 02:16:28,038
Everything is all right?

1916
02:16:28,121 --> 02:16:30,582
- I am so happy.
- Thank you, Consuelo.

1917
02:16:30,707 --> 02:16:32,250
You look for the girl?

1918
02:16:32,334 --> 02:16:33,585
She's in there.

1919
02:16:34,461 --> 02:16:36,755
"No got time."

1920
02:16:43,637 --> 02:16:44,972
Hi, John T.

1921
02:16:45,722 --> 02:16:48,433
Just a second while I get my shoe tied.

1922
02:16:50,852 --> 02:16:52,020
There.

1923
02:16:55,023 --> 02:16:57,067
It's all over, isn't it, John T?

1924
02:16:57,192 --> 02:16:59,152
Where'd you get those things?

1925
02:16:59,987 --> 02:17:02,197
I wore them the last place I worked.

1926
02:17:03,699 --> 02:17:05,909
Why are you wearing them now?

1927
02:17:06,702 --> 02:17:08,245
Tonight's a big night.

1928
02:17:08,328 --> 02:17:10,789
Consuelo thought
a little entertainment might help.

1929
02:17:10,872 --> 02:17:12,249
I'm going to do a song.

1930
02:17:12,332 --> 02:17:14,626
You need a rig like that to sing?

1931
02:17:15,002 --> 02:17:16,545
You haven't heard me sing.

1932
02:17:16,628 --> 02:17:20,465
My legs aren't so bad.
Consuelo thought these tights might help.

1933
02:17:21,675 --> 02:17:23,093
But you don't like them.

1934
02:17:23,176 --> 02:17:26,388
- I didn't say that.
- You don't want me to wear them.

1935
02:17:26,471 --> 02:17:28,015
I didn't say that either.

1936
02:17:28,098 --> 02:17:31,935
- Is it because they show so much of me?
- They certainly do that.

1937
02:17:34,021 --> 02:17:37,190
You're a stubborn man, John T.

1938
02:17:38,900 --> 02:17:41,278
Sometimes I know what you're thinking.

1939
02:17:42,029 --> 02:17:43,697
And other times...

1940
02:17:44,698 --> 02:17:47,868
You just can't make up
your mind about me, can you?

1941
02:17:48,035 --> 02:17:49,536
You like what you see.

1942
02:17:49,620 --> 02:17:52,539
You like kissing me.
You like what you touch.

1943
02:17:53,206 --> 02:17:56,627
But you decided in the beginning
what kind of a girl I was.

1944
02:17:57,711 --> 02:17:59,546
And I haven't helped much.

1945
02:18:00,714 --> 02:18:02,924
I wore these before I met you.

1946
02:18:03,216 --> 02:18:04,926
I wanted you to know it.

1947
02:18:05,427 --> 02:18:08,096
To know what kind of a girl
you were getting.

1948
02:18:08,722 --> 02:18:13,352
I wanted you to get that funny look
on your face and tell me not to wear them.

1949
02:18:14,019 --> 02:18:15,562
But it didn't work.

1950
02:18:16,188 --> 02:18:17,898
You didn't even get mad.

1951
02:18:21,443 --> 02:18:24,404
I told you once
you wouldn't have to say anything.

1952
02:18:25,072 --> 02:18:28,325
That I'd know, but I don't know.

1953
02:18:29,993 --> 02:18:32,120
So, you're going to have to talk.

1954
02:18:33,121 --> 02:18:36,083
I'm hard to get, John T.

1955
02:18:36,166 --> 02:18:38,210
You're going to have to say you want me.

1956
02:18:38,293 --> 02:18:40,921
- Where're you going?
- Downstairs.

1957
02:18:41,004 --> 02:18:42,464
You'd better not.

1958
02:18:43,090 --> 02:18:44,883
Why had I better not?

1959
02:18:45,092 --> 02:18:46,593
Because I'm still sheriff.

1960
02:18:46,677 --> 02:18:49,596
You wear those things in public,
I'll arrest you.

1961
02:18:53,892 --> 02:18:55,060
John T.

1962
02:18:57,604 --> 02:19:00,315
I've waited so long for you to say that.

1963
02:19:00,983 --> 02:19:02,567
I thought you were never...

1964
02:19:02,651 --> 02:19:04,861
You have the funniest way
of saying things.

1965
02:19:04,987 --> 02:19:07,281
Just when I think
you're going to say one thing...

1966
02:19:07,364 --> 02:19:10,534
Get those darn things off. I'll wait outside.

1967
02:19:10,617 --> 02:19:13,787
No, you don't have to go.
I can use this screen.

1968
02:19:14,579 --> 02:19:16,957
Besides I want you to stay here...

1969
02:19:17,082 --> 02:19:19,626
...because the other thing is all over now,
isn't it?

1970
02:19:19,751 --> 02:19:22,129
I'm trying to hurry, but I'm all thumbs.

1971
02:19:22,754 --> 02:19:24,715
What I had to go through!

1972
02:19:25,132 --> 02:19:28,552
Put on these tights,
ask a lot of questions...

1973
02:19:28,677 --> 02:19:32,180
...start to walk out.
I thought you were never going to say it.

1974
02:19:32,306 --> 02:19:33,307
Say what?

1975
02:19:33,473 --> 02:19:35,100
That you loved me.

1976
02:19:35,183 --> 02:19:37,060
I said I'd arrest you.

1977
02:19:37,311 --> 02:19:40,897
It means the same thing, you know that.
You just won't say it.

1978
02:19:41,315 --> 02:19:44,234
We're different.
I'll have to get used to you.

1979
02:19:44,318 --> 02:19:46,445
Me, I just talk all the time.

1980
02:19:46,570 --> 02:19:48,447
You most certainly do.

1981
02:19:48,572 --> 02:19:51,366
You'll get used to that. You'll have to.

1982
02:19:51,450 --> 02:19:53,827
Either that or start talking, too.

1983
02:19:56,121 --> 02:19:57,789
Tell me something.

1984
02:19:58,081 --> 02:20:02,002
These tights, now why didn't you
want me to wear them?

1985
02:20:02,502 --> 02:20:05,756
Because I didn't want anybody
but me to see you in them.

1986
02:20:06,006 --> 02:20:07,382
I like that.

1987
02:20:07,841 --> 02:20:09,885
You're getting better already.

1988
02:20:10,677 --> 02:20:13,347
Shall I save them
and wear them just for you?

1989
02:20:28,028 --> 02:20:32,658
- Do you think I'll ever get to be a sheriff?
- Not unless you mind your own business.
