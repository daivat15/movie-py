Is to get your supper and

Good evening. Saturday
night, Mr. Peabody.

339
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:18,585
Better order early before those
drunks come from across the street.

Hallie, please. The proprieties
concerning the cutlery.

The usual.

346

Steak, beans, potatoes,
and deep-dish apple pie.

347
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:44,652
Three steaks with
a lot of black.

- All right. - KAINTUCK:
Lot of black-eyes, Hallie.

All right, Kaintuck!

"Under the law of

No. I can't read,
and I can't write.

and writing done you?

didn't mean to hurt her.

She'll get over it. What is
reading and writing for a girl?

She'll make a wonderful wife
for the man she marries.

Yeah. And if Tom Doniphon is smart,
he pops the question to Hallie

before some busybody I am married
to upsets his bag of apples.

before come the drunks.

the other day,

but I've been reading
up, and there it is.

I'll draw up the complaint,
take care of the details,

it says so right there.

- Right, right.

Not to yours, Tom.
Sit down, sit down.

I suppose you know who's
across the street?

477
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,812
Yeah. I hear he
sent word on ahead.

478
00:39:58,814 --> 00:40:03,359
He won't like what the town's been
saying about him and that hold-up.

How about you, Kaintuck?

- Yes, ma'am.
- Well-burnt.

- (STAMMERING) And deep...
- Deep-dish apple pie.

- Yeah.
- Coming up.

Mighty pretty.

I agree with you, Sir.

486
00:40:24,506 --> 00:40:26,090
Just told her so.

00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:29,135
What? Do I hear wedding bells?

00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:33,347

- Don't Rush me, Mr. Editor.

There's your cactus Rose.
Sure is pretty.

00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:46,819
Thank you, Pompey. It is pretty.

492
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:49,614
- Go in and get supper.
- Thank you, ma'am.

Oh, Rance.

Look at that.

Isn't that the prettiest
thing you ever saw?

496
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,709
Yeah, it's very pretty.

497
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,256
Did you ever see a real Rose?

498
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,592
No.

When you finish the dishes,
will you help wait tables?

503
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:31,656
- Sure. - Washing dishes
is enough for him.

504
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:35,409
- A man waiting on tables?
- Well, no, I'd be glad to help.

505
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,204
Be glad to.

Oh. 37, huh?

Well, by golly! If we can
only get them to vote,

00:50:28,443 --> 00:50:31,111
maybe we can handle

see how Julietta was doing.

00:52:07,959 --> 00:52:09,334
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

631
00:52:09,419 --> 00:52:12,421
How's the rest of my
family doing in reading?

632
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:15,632
Well, Hallie's in charge
of the kindergarten.

633
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:18,885
Hallie, why don't you
run through the ABCs?

634
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:25,726
All right, you ready?

635
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:29,688
One, two, three.

636
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:34,443
A, B, C, D, E, F, G

637
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:38,238
H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P

638
00:52:38,573 --> 00:52:42,242
Q, R, S and T, U, V.

639
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:46,204
W, X and Y and Z.

640
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:50,334
Now I know my ABCs.

641
00:52:50,752 --> 00:52:54,087
Tell me what you think of me.

642
00:52:54,422 --> 00:52:56,965
RANCE: Well, that was
just fine, just fine.

643
00:52:57,884 --> 00:53:00,552
Well, I see a couple more
new pupils back there.

644
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:05,265
Highpockets, Kaintuck, you fellas
really serious about readin'?

645
00:53:05,558 --> 00:53:07,476
Go on. Stand up. Tell him.

646
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:13,023
Well, Miss Hallie,

647
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:16,651
she talked such a right smart
argument to the Lazy J...

648
00:53:16,736 --> 00:53:17,944
(STAMMERING)

649
00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:19,738
The boss of the Lazy J...

650
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:24,117
Well, he just up and told all
the hands to cut the cards

651
00:53:24,202 --> 00:53:27,913
to see who come to
school, and I lost.

652
00:53:28,081 --> 00:53:32,084
I see. Well, we'll try...
Good morning, Mr. Carruthers.

653
00:53:32,168 --> 00:53:36,588
Good morning. Caught him
playing hookey again, fishing.

654
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:38,382
Catch anything, Herbert?

655
00:53:38,466 --> 00:53:41,551
- No, Sir. They weren't biting.
- That's too bad.

656
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:44,179
- Ain't you gonna whop him?
- He's too big.

657
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:47,349
For the benefit of those
of you just starting,

658
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:50,894
none of us in here
smoke, Mr. Carruthers.

659
00:53:52,814 --> 00:53:54,147
Thank you.

660
00:53:54,816 --> 00:53:57,776
For those of you who
have just started,

661
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:01,238
I might explain to you that
we've begun the school

662
00:54:01,322 --> 00:54:03,698
by studying about our country

663
00:54:04,826 --> 00:54:06,660
and how it's governed.

664
00:54:07,537 --> 00:54:08,787
Now, let's see.

665
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:10,539
Well, now, Nora...

666
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:15,836
Would you tell the class what you've
learned about the United States?

667
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:25,679
The United States is a Republic

668
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:29,349
and a Republic

669
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:33,353
is a state in which

670
00:54:35,231 --> 00:54:37,149
the people are the boss.

671
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:40,485
That means us.

672
00:54:41,696 --> 00:54:46,700
And if the big shots in
Washington don't do like we want,

673
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:50,203
we don't vote for them,
by golly, no more.

674
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:52,414
- Any more!
- Any more.

675
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:55,709
That's fine, Nora.
That's just fine.

676
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:59,796
Now, I wonder if anybody
in class remembers

677
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:02,883
what the basic law of
the land is called.

678
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:05,177
You remember I told you

679
00:55:05,261 --> 00:55:08,430
it had to be added to
and changed sometimes

680
00:55:08,514 --> 00:55:10,307
by things called amendments.

681
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:12,184
Does anybody remember?

682
00:55:12,268 --> 00:55:14,144
Julietta, your hand's always up.

683
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:17,189
Here, let's... Pompey,
you try this one.

684
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,655
It was writ by Mr. Thomas
Jefferson of Virginia.

685
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:29,534
- "Was written", Pompey. -
Written by Mr. Thomas Jefferson.

686
00:55:30,036 --> 00:55:33,747
- He called it the Constitution. -
RANCE: Declaration of Independence.

687
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:36,416
It begun with the words,

688
00:55:36,501 --> 00:55:40,378
"We hold these truths to be..."

689
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:43,548
- (WHISPERING) Self-evident.
- Let him alone, Charlie.

690
00:55:43,633 --> 00:55:46,885
"Self-evident that..."

691
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:50,472
"That all men are
created equal."

692
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:54,893
That's fine, Pompey.

693
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:57,479
I knew that, but I
plumb forgot it.

694
00:55:57,730 --> 00:56:01,608
A lot of people forget that part.
You did just fine, Pompey.

695
00:56:01,943 --> 00:56:03,026
Thank you.

696
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,278
This law also states

697
00:56:05,363 --> 00:56:08,031
that the governing power
rests with the electorate.

698
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:11,201
Now, that means you,
that means the people.

699
00:56:11,786 --> 00:56:16,456
And you exercise this power
through the vote. Now, then. Yes?

700
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:19,167
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

701
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:24,965
Well, Hallie? Go
right ahead, Hallie.

702
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:30,470
Now, here is the best
textbook in the world.

703
00:56:30,555 --> 00:56:31,846
It's an honest newspaper.

704
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:35,684
This is the Shinbone Star,
Dutton Peabody, Editor-in-Chief.

705
00:56:36,018 --> 00:56:39,729
And reading this ought to
bring home to everybody

706
00:56:39,814 --> 00:56:42,732
the importance of
using that vote.

707
00:56:42,817 --> 00:56:46,236
Now, the headlines say,
"Cattlemen fight statehood."

708
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,280
"Small homesteaders in danger."

709
00:56:48,364 --> 00:56:53,034
It says clearly that if big ranchers
north of the Picketwire River

710
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:56,496
win their fight to keep this
territory in open reign,

711
00:56:56,581 --> 00:57:01,209
then all your truck
farms and your corn,

712
00:57:01,294 --> 00:57:03,378
the small shopkeepers
and everything,

713
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:07,090
the future of your kids, it
will all be all over, be gone!

714
00:57:07,675 --> 00:57:10,677
And they call upon
you in this article,

715
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:15,765
they call upon you to unite
behind a real strong delegate

716
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:19,352
and carry this fight to
Washington if necessary.

717
00:57:20,021 --> 00:57:21,354
Hello, Tom.

718
00:57:21,856 --> 00:57:24,024
Welcome back. You
want to join us?

719
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:26,276
I'm looking for Pompey.

720
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:30,905
I've been away three weeks, and
there's no sashes or doors in yet.

721
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:35,785
Why have you been wasting time here?
Get to work. Your schooling's over.

722
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:39,497
Don't get rough with Pompey.
He's entitled to a...

723
00:57:39,582 --> 00:57:43,126
What I got to say to you
will be a whole lot rougher.

724
00:57:43,878 --> 00:57:47,547
The good editor here has
written some noble words,

725
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:51,760
and you read 'em good, but
if you put that paper out,

726
00:57:51,844 --> 00:57:54,763
the streets of Shinbone
will be running with blood.

727
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:58,141
Why are you against this,
Tom, you of all people?

728
00:57:58,225 --> 00:58:02,395
Aren't there more votes south
of the Picketwire than north?

729
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:05,940
That's right, but votes won't
stand up against guns.

730
00:58:06,108 --> 00:58:08,568
Guns? What guns, Tom?

731
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:12,947
You think Valance stays away from
here 'cause he's scared of you?

732
00:58:13,282 --> 00:58:16,242
He's recruiting hired guns
for the big ranchers.

733
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:17,911
- Julietta.
- (SPEAKING SPANISH)

734
00:58:18,037 --> 00:58:19,788
Take the little ones home.

735
00:58:20,331 --> 00:58:21,706
(BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH)

736
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:22,832
Come on.

737
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:26,711
Hallie, it would be a good
idea if you dismissed class.

738
00:58:26,796 --> 00:58:29,589
- Dismiss class?
- Go on. Dismiss them, please.

739
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:31,508
(RINGING)

740
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:34,302
Class dismissed!
Same time tomorrow.

741
00:58:34,387 --> 00:58:36,346
AMOS: You get to the store.

742
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:42,644
This could get worse
than the sheep wars.

743
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:46,481
- Will they start anything
here? - It's already started.

744
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:49,275
Valance and his men crossed
the river yesterday,

745
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,904
killed old man
Holliday and his son.

746
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:55,865
- You know that for a
fact, Tom? - I do.

747
00:58:56,117 --> 00:58:59,994
They tried to bushwhack me,
unfortunately for one of them.

748
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:02,497
You gonna put that
in your newspaper?

749
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:04,708
It's news, and I'm
a newspaperman.

750
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:07,168
Print that, he'll kill
you, sure as hell.

751
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:08,855
LINK: You think they'll
come here, Tom?

752
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:13,591
They'll be here, tomorrow
or the next day,

753
00:59:13,676 --> 00:59:16,970
according to how much
who-hit-John they consume,

754
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:21,725
but election day, pilgrim, you can
depend on it, they'll be here.

755
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:24,269
Hallie, go back
where you belong.

756
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:26,771
I don't want you in
no shooting gallery.

757
00:59:26,856 --> 00:59:29,149
Now, you listen to
me, Tom Doniphon.

758
00:59:29,567 --> 00:59:32,527
What I do and where I go
is none of your business.

759
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:34,154
You don't own me.

760
00:59:35,698 --> 00:59:40,160
Like I said, Hallie, you're
awful pretty when you get mad.

761
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:43,621
Hal.

762
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:04,267
Rance, after all
you've taught us,

763
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:07,228
how can you say we should
knuckle under now?

764
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:09,856
You heard what Tom said.

765
01:00:10,149 --> 01:00:13,318
When force threatens,
talk's no good any more.

766
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,575
Hallie...

767
01:00:23,204 --> 01:00:26,164
Hallie, you go find Tom
and make it up to him.

768
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:27,373
He...

769
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:30,210
He's only trying to protect you.

770
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:12,585
Rance.

771
01:01:13,921 --> 01:01:15,255
Rance!

772
01:01:16,257 --> 01:01:18,216
Better let him go, Hallie.

773
01:01:21,554 --> 01:01:23,888
Why? Where's he going?

774
01:01:24,932 --> 01:01:27,433
He's gonna need all the
practice he can get.

775
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:32,105
Practice? What are
you talking about?

776
01:01:36,652 --> 01:01:38,945
I might as well
let you know now.

777
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:43,241
When he decided to come in with
me, I let him have a gun of mine.

778
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:48,121
He's been going out in the country
twice a week, practising, ever since.

779
01:01:49,832 --> 01:01:53,543
You mean he's going to face up
to Liberty, Liberty Valance?

780
01:01:54,503 --> 01:01:55,545
Rance?

781
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:57,922
That's the only way
I can figure it.

782
01:01:58,007 --> 01:02:01,467
He never would discuss it.
He just keeps on

783
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:04,137

01:59:22,740 --> 01:59:24,699
back again to the Senate,

1417
01:59:25,409 --> 01:59:28,411
and a man who, with a
snap of his fingers,

1418
01:59:29,580 --> 01:59:32,999
could be the next vice-president
of the United States.

1419
01:59:38,213 --> 01:59:40,673
You're not going to use
the story, Mr. Scott?

1420
01:59:41,759 --> 01:59:43,051
No, Sir.

1421
01:59:47,514 --> 01:59:49,307
This is the west, Sir.

1422
01:59:49,391 --> 01:59:52,518
When the legend becomes
fact, print the legend.

1423
01:59:53,103 --> 01:59:54,771
He's right, Rance.

(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING)

1425
02:00:17,127 --> 02:00:19,170
It's getting late, Hallie.

1426
02:00:23,759 --> 02:00:26,344
We'll keep in touch
with you, Pompey.

1427
02:00:27,221 --> 02:00:28,679
I promise.

1428
02:00:29,181 --> 02:00:30,807
But, Mr. Rance...

1429
02:00:30,974 --> 02:00:32,600
Pork chop money.

Hallie...

1433
02:00:55,707 --> 02:00:58,334
Hallie, would you be too sorry

1434
02:00:59,378 --> 02:01:02,672
if once I get the new
irrigation bill through...

1435
02:01:04,883 --> 02:01:09,595
Would you be too sorry if we
just up and left Washington?

1436
02:01:11,515 --> 02:01:12,557
I...

1437
02:01:13,684 --> 02:01:18,563
I sort of have a hankering
to come back here to live.

1438
02:01:20,023 --> 02:01:23,025
- Maybe open up a law office.
- Rance...

1439
02:01:25,404 --> 02:01:28,156
If you knew how often
I'd dreamed of it.

1440
02:01:29,491 --> 02:01:31,159
My roots are here.

1441
02:01:33,036 --> 02:01:35,037
I guess my heart is here.

1442
02:01:36,707 --> 02:01:38,499
Yes, let's come back.

1443
02:01:41,253 --> 02:01:44,380
Look at it. It was
once a wilderness.

1444
02:01:45,549 --> 02:01:47,216
Now it's a garden.

1445
02:01:47,926 --> 02:01:49,552
Aren't you proud?

1446
02:01:53,390 --> 02:01:58,186
Hallie, who put the cactus
roses on Tom's coffin?

1447
02:02:00,272 --> 02:02:01,564
I did.

1448
02:02:08,780 --> 02:02:12,408
Here, I got a brand-new
spittoon, cuspidor, Hallie.

1449
02:02:12,784 --> 02:02:16,496
And the engineer's got a full
head of steam in this bucket.

1450
02:02:16,914 --> 02:02:20,833
We'll make 25 miles an hour
or bust a boiler trying.

1451
02:02:20,918 --> 02:02:24,378
And we wired ahead
to Junction City.

1452
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:26,672
They'll hold the Express.

1453
02:02:26,757 --> 02:02:29,967
In two days and nights,
you'll be back in Washington.

1454
02:02:30,135 --> 02:02:31,844
Thank you, Jason.

1455
02:02:31,929 --> 02:02:35,264
I'll write to the officials
of this rail road

1456
02:02:35,349 --> 02:02:39,644
and thank them for their kindness
and for going to all this trouble.

1457
02:02:40,062 --> 02:02:41,604
You think nothing of it.

Nothing's too good for the man
who shot Liberty Valance.
