Yeah!

39
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:12,942
Here's some for 37 cents.
Here's some for 32.

40
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,736
Thirty-one.

41
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,864
Think that's it.
Don't they have any generics here?

42
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,408
I think this is their generic.
I never heard of that brand.

43
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,743
Maybe we should get this one.
Maybe it's worth a penny.

44
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,745
You're paying for advertising.

45
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:28,165
Tuna. We should get tuna.
Please, no more tuna, okay?

46
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,834
It's got protein. We need protein.

47
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,420
Beans are protein.
Beans make you fart.

48
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,589
We got a convertible.

49
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,758
I'm gettin' it for myself.

50
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,227
One burrito
and one large Slush.

51
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:56,235
$21.67.
Can you fill this up?

52
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,032
21.67.

53
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,062
This next one's
a WSTT special request.

54
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:34,148
It goes out to Ernestine
from Charles Weaver
with a big old hug and kiss.

55
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,485
-Jesus. Look.
I forgot to pay for this.

56
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:41,697
You could have gotten caught.
What if somebody saw?
The laws are medieval down here.

57
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,450
You know what the minimum age
for execution is in Alabama?

58
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,077
What, 16?
Ten!

59
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,245
Ten?

60
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,587
- There's a cop behind us.
- A cop?

61
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,756
There's nothin'
to worry about.
There might be.

62
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,050
There's nothin' to worry about
until there's somethin' to worry about.

63
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,719
Just relax. Please.

64
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,975
Is he still there?
Yeah.

65
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,143
Goddamn it.
Just calm down.

66
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:14,605
There's a cop behind us. That's all.
There's nothing wrong. There's no problem.

67
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,274
Uh-oh.

68
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,318
What?
His light's on.

69
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:21,362
Fuck. Fuck! Goddamn it!

70
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,656
Fuck! What are we gonna do now?
It's probably nothin'.

71
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,533
It might be a taillight.
Just relax.

72
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,284
We don't have any money for bail.

73
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:30,162
Bail? We don't need money for bail.
Nothing's happened. Relax.

74
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:33,165
Nothing? We're getting pulled over,
aren't we? You stole something.
You're finished.

75
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,002
- Shut up. All right?

76
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,590
All right. Here he comes.

77
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,388
Show me your hands!

78
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,558
-Jesus.
- Show me your hands!
Get 'em up!

79
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:53,477
Get 'em up! Up!

80
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:58,232
Now put your hands
on top of your head
and get out of the car!

81
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:01,527
Out of the car!
Go.

82
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:05,573
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
It's number three and five.

83
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,200
Ridiculous.
All this over a can of tuna.

84
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,494
Keep quiet!

85
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,998
Yeah. Uh-huh. You sure about that?

86
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:18,085
- Yeah, he's standing right here.

87
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,212
All right. Bye.

88
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,882
I think
we may get a confession.

89
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,889
I just heard that
someone shot Jimmy Willis.

90
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,892
He's dead.
Oh, my God!

91
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,935
Who would do such a thing?

92
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,570
Hello, Bill. I'm Sheriff Farley.
Hi.

93
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,203
Do you know why you're here?
Yeah.

94
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,663
I do. I'm sorry.
It was a stupid thing to do.

95
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,166
Have you been made aware of your rights?

96
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,834
Yes.

97
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,544
You willing to waive that right?

98
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,254
Yes. I'm willing to cooperate fully.

99
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,382
I'll sign a statement or whatever
makes this whole thing easier.

100
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:10,679
Good. Good.
That's-That's good.

101
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:14,308
But I want you to know, Stan,
he had nothing to do with it.

102
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,977
Did he help you plan it?

103
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:21,899
No. I mean- I mean,
it wasn't planned out.
You know, it just happened.

104
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,860
Did Stan try to stop you at any time?

105
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,739
No. I mean, he was-

106
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,206
- Why? Is that a big deal?
- Aidin' and abettin'.

107
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,959
Aiding and abetting?
What is that, a major thing?

108
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:43,129
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

109
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,881
An accessory?

110
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:49,301
Are you guys kidding? An accessory?
I didn't help. I didn't plan it.

111
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,472
You didn't try to stop it.

112
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:56,684
I didn't know it was happening.
I found out later in the car.

113
00:07:56,768 --> 00:08:00,604
Why didn't you get out?
Call the police then?

114
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,858
He's my friend.

115
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,861
Well,

116
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:10,239
your friend has put you
in a lot of trouble.

117
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,283
What's gonna happen to Bill?

118
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:17,079
Nothin', unless he's convicted.

119
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,957
Of course if he is,

120
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,960
we're gonna run enough electricity
through him to light up Birmingham.

121
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,047
We were friends at NYU.

122
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,967
We both applied,
and we got scholarships to UCLA.

123
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,470
We figured the weather and the scenery
would be nicer going through the South.

124
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:36,557
- What about the tuna fish?
- Then I forgot about the can of tuna fish.

125
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,559
And then we-we left.

126
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,604
Did he catch you with the tuna fish?
Is that how it started?

127
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,691
- No. He didn't say anything.
- But he knew about it?

128
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,862
I don't know.

129
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,825
Let's talk about that
for a moment.

130
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,787
You paid for the groceries.

131
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:05,002
- And then what?
- We went out to the car, and that's it.

132
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,171
When'd you shoot him?

133
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,842
- What?
- At what point did you shoot the clerk?

134
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,971
- I shot the clerk?
- Yes. When did you shoot him?

135
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,973
I shot the clerk?

136
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,892
Hey, Dean.
We need you out here.

137
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,269
I'm in the middle
of a damn confession here!

138
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,984
Whoa! Wait a minute!

139
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,914
What's the matter?

140
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,084
Do you know what this is all about?
Yeah, they're fucking with us.

141
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,754
You don't believe them?
No. They don't execute
for shoplifting.

142
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,839
You think we're being booked
for shoplifting, huh?
No.

143
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:54,927
You're being booked for shoplifting.
I'm being booked for accessory
to shoplifting.

144
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:59,473
No. Stan,
I'm being booked for murder, and you're
being booked for accessory to murder.

145
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,229
It's time to make
your phone calls.

146
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,815
Goddamn it!
Is there any way you
could contact your parents?

147
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,566
How? Call the Chilean consulate?

148
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:13,195
What are they going to do,
send a guide into the mountains,
looking for them? No.

149
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,739
We need to call an attorney,
a great attorney.

150
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,992
Do you know any great attorneys?

151
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:21,078
No. I'm calling my mother.

152
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,499
Hello, Ma. We're in Wahzoo.

153
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,876
It's in Beechum County,
Alabama, Ma.

154
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,754
Not too good, Ma.
We, uh...

155
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,133
We-We've been arrested.

156
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,260
Ma? Ma, please.

157
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,638
Ma, please, first of all,
we didn't do it, all right?

158
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,435
Murder. Ma. Ma, please-

159
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,396
Ma, it's a mistake.
We must look like the guys
who did it.

160
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,024
Tell her what
we think is happening.
What we think's happening is-

161
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,776
Shut up. We think they're trying
to set us up as patsies, Ma.

162
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,945
You know how corrupt
it is down here.

163
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,699
They all know each other.
The Klan's here. They're inbred.
They sleep with their sisters.

164
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,203
Some of them do.
All right, Ma, listen.

165
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:07,207
We gotta get an attorney,
and it's gonna cost a lot of money.

166
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:12,546
How much would an attorney cost?
A decent one?
$50,000. $100,000.

167
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,841
50,000. 100,000-
I know, Ma. I know.

168
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,803
Can we use any attorney?
I think so.

169
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,805
He says he thinks so.

170
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:27,978
- Oh, he is? Well, that's a great idea.
You'll think he'll do it?
- What?

171
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:30,064
- We got an attorney in the family.
- Great! Who?

172
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,440
My cousin Vinny!

173
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,492
' Mind your business ♪
' She's sayin' this '

174
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,244
- ♪ Then he's sayin' that '
- What is that?

175
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,706
' I thought she was thin
I thought she was fat '

176
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:51,794
' Deception, collection
Use your own affliction '

177
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,546
' The trial of survival '

178
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,757
' You need to mind your business '

179
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,885
' Yeah
Mind your business '

180
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,388
' Mind your business '
' Mind your business '

181
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:06,016
' Mind your business '
Where is he from?

182
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,437
' You need to mind your business '

183
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,439
' They try to tie you down '

184
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,066
' With a ball and chain'

185
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,984
' You try to make a move '

186
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,278
' So they change the game '

187
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:21,949
' Every time you're up
they try to bring you down '

188
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,743
' I'm telling you right now '

189
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:38,757
' Deception, collection
Infection, objection... ''

190
00:12:57,152 --> 00:13:01,363
- What?
- Nothin'. You stick out like
a sore thumb around here.

191
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,031
Me? What about you?

192
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:06,535
I fit in better than you.
At least I'm wearing cowboy boots.

193
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,746
Oh, yeah, you blend.

194
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:14,460
I bet the Chinese food here
is terrible.

195
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,629
I don't see anything
out of whack under there.

196
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:21,300
It feels like the wheels went out
of balance after we hit that mud.
That's not it.

197
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:24,303
I think you should put it on a rack
and take a look.

198
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,930
What's wrong?

199
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,141
What?
What's the problem?

200
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,435
Nothing. The car was shimmying
on the highway a little bit.

201
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,479
You got mud in your tires.

202
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,522
I got mud in my tires?
Mm-hmm.

203
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:39,693
How do you get mud into the tires?
That's just a figure of speech.

204
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:43,405
The mud gets around
the inside of the wheel,
throws the balance off.

205
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,657
You ever hear of that?
Mud in the tires?

206
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:50,662
- No.
- She never heard of it.
She knows everything about cars.

207
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,332
Hmm.

208
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:57,044
Now see, down here,
everybody gets stuck
in the mud every now and then.

209
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,129
Yep, we're famous
for our mud.

210
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:03,175
Famous for your mud?
How's your Chinese food?

211
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:07,221
- You just keep on asking
about Chinese food.

212
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,306
Can't you tell they don't have
Chinese restaurants around here?

213
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,308
Gotta let everybody know
you're a tourist. Come on.

214
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,478
Oh. What are you,
a fuckin' world traveler?

215
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,870
Stop the death penalty!

216
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:34,039
Our jail was condemned this morning.

217
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:38,168
That's why we're bringing you all out
to the state corrections facility.

218
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:43,924
Stop the death penalty!

219
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,468
Stop the death penalty!

220
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,933
Unlock the gate!

221
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,313
Go on through.

222
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,485
Whoo!

223
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:50,449
You know what happens
in these places?
Yeah, I know what happens in these places.

224
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:54,620
And sometimes there's
a big guy named Bubba
no one wants to tangle with.

225
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:58,165
He'll protect you,
but you have to become his sex slave
and do whatever he wants.

226
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:01,084
There's only the two of us here.

227
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:05,589
What about those cots?
I mean, what if they put
somebody else in here?

228
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,966
Stan.

229
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,969
Shut up.
Okay.

230
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,897
Hey! I can't believe my luck!

231
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,870
Here.

232
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,624
We got somebody for you.

233
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,796
You must be Stan.
How ya doin'?

234
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:50,008
Why'd they
bring you in here?
Well, I just got in.

235
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,719
I asked where the new guys were,
and they brought me right here.

236
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,013
He's sleeping, huh?
Cute little guy.

237
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:59,226
Maybe I'll just start with you.
We'll let him sleep a little bit.

238
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:03,021
I don't wanna do this.
Hey, I don't blame you.

239
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:06,900
If I was in your situation,
I'd want to get through
this whole thing as quickly...

240
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,986
and with as little pain as possible.

241
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:14,157
So, you know,
let's try our best to make it
a simple in-and-out procedure.

242
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,078
What's the matter?

243
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,580
Relax. Relax. Relax.

244
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,500
You know,
maybe we should spend
a couple of minutes together,

245
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:27,504
you know, to get acquainted
before we, uh, you know,
before we get to it.

246
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:33,176
What's wrong with you?
I don't want to do this.

247
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:37,973
Well, I understand,
but, you know, what are your alternatives?

248
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,100
My alternatives?
Yeah.

249
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,854
To what? To you?
I don't know. Suicide. Death.

250
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:49,443
Look, it's either me or them.
You're gettin' fucked one way
or the other.

251
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,987
Hey, hey, hey.

252
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,906
Lighten up, okay?
Don't worry. I'm gonna help ya.

253
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,908
Oh. Gee, thanks.

254
00:17:56,993 --> 00:18:00,996
Excuse me, but I think a modicum of
gratitude would not be out of line here.

255
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,039
You think I should be grateful?

256
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,333
Yeah. I mean,
it's your ass, not mine.

257
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,170
I think you should be grateful.

258
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,714
I think you should be down
on your fuckin' knees.

259
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,508
I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was such an honor
to get a visit from you.

260
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:17,345
I'm doing a favor here, you know?
You're gettin' me for nothing,
ya little fuck.

261
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,598
Boy, that's one hell
of an ego you've got.

262
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,559
What the fuck is your problem?

263
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,020
I did not come down here
just to get jerked off.

264
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,397
No, no. No, no.

265
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:30,817
I'm not jerking you off.
I'm not doing anything.

266
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:33,904
That's it. You're on your own.
I'm just taking care of Sleeping Beauty.

267
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,490
Hey, Billy!
Hey, back off!

268
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,159
Vin! Hey, Vinny!
Vinny?

269
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:42,245
Vinny Bag-o'-doughnuts,
how are ya?
This is Vinny?

270
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,498
I don't know where to start.

271
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:48,168
Have you had
any murder cases before?

272
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,587
None. This would be my first.

273
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,589
Your first?
Yeah.

274
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:59,262
What kind of cases have you had?
Assault and battery, armed robbery.
You know.

275
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,391
No.

276
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:08,230
Well, I expect he's done burglary,
grand theft auto, drugs. Right, Vin?

277
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:12,943
No. Nothing like that either.

278
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,946
What kind...
What kind of law do you practice?

279
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:21,660
Well, up till now, uh, personal injury.

280
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:28,458
Well, you're a trial attorney, right?
I mean, personal injury trials.

281
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:32,462
Well, actually, this would be
my first foray into the trial process.

282
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:35,298
I haven't had
to go to court yet.

283
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:38,134
Knock on wood.

284
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:43,431
You haven't had to go to court yet.
How long have you been practicing?

285
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,475
Almost six weeks.

286
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,401
But- Vin, you graduated
from law school six years ago.
What have you been doing since?

287
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,653
Studying for the bar.

288
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,156
- Six years?
- Mm-hmm.

289
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,701
That's a lot of studying.

290
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:05,412
Well, to be honest with you,

291
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:09,165
I, um- I didn't pass my first time out.

292
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,627
That's okay. You probably
passed the second time, right?

293
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,880
I'm afraid not.

294
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:19,009
- Three times a charm?
- Not for me it isn't.

295
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,887
No. For me, six times was a charm.

296
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,182
Six times.

297
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,381
A little informal, aren't we?

298
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,676
I was just resting...
Not wearing a coat or tie.

299
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,012
Oh! Sorry.

300
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:09,809
Well, approving an attorney
from out of state is
a pretty informal matter.

301
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:14,064
- I just have a few questions.
- Okay. Fire away, Judge.

302
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,150
Where did you
go to law school?
Brooklyn Academy of Law.

303
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,653
Is that an accredited law school?

304
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,279
Uh-

305
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:27,243
Oh. Yes.

306
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:29,329
How long you been practicing?

307
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:33,416
Oh, about, uh, six, uh-

308
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:36,127
Almost 16 years.

309
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:40,548
- Any murder cases?
Lots of them. Quite a few. Yes.

310
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,759
What was the outcome?

311
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,011
Uh, you know, win some, lose some.

312
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:47,389
Hmm.

313
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,766
This is not the forum to be cavalier.

314
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,353
Oh, of course.
Now let me see.

315
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,397
Most recently,
I had an ax murder,

316
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,984
which I won on the grounds
of temporary insanity.

317
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,277
- Want to hear the facts of the case?
- No.

318
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:03,488
What else?
Let me see. What else?

319
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,199
You ever heard of the Son of Sam?

320
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,827
Fellow who received orders
to kill from a dog?

321
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,495
That one.

322
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:13,957
You defended him?
Well, no. Not exactly.

323
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,793
I, uh-
I defended the first guy they arrested.

324
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:21,256
And, uh,
he was found innocent and set free,

325
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,134
and, uh, they caught the real guy.

326
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:31,141
Well, we don't have
any serial killers in Beechum County.

327
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:36,187
But what we do have is every bit as
sophisticated a system of justice...

328
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,231
as they do
in the rest of the country.

329
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:43,570
- Oh, I'm sure.
- You being from New York and all
might have the impression that law is...

330
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:47,323
practiced with a certain degree
of informality down here.

331
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,743
It isn't.
Right.

332
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:54,998
I tell you this because I want you to
know that when it comes to procedure,

333
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,584
I'm not a patient man.

334
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,714
I advise you, sir,
when you come into my courtroom,
you are to know the letter of the law.

335
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,009
- I react harshly when you don't.
- You should.

336
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:09,679
- Don't think being from New York
you're gonna get special treatment.
- I shouldn't.

337
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,475
You won't.

338
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,811
You'll be given
no leeway whatsoever.

339
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:23,693
I expect you to know this information
when you come into my courtroom.

340
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:25,737
Uh-huh. Right.

341
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:28,698
You willing
to accept those terms?
Right. No problem.

342
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,036
Just this?

343
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,741
' And if you love him '

344
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:16,162
' Oh, be proud of him '

345
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:19,707
' 'Cause after all, he’s just a man '

346
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,585
This is gonna be great.
Vinny's first case.

347
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:28,258
- So? What can I do to help?
- ' Stand by your man '

348
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,387
Nothing?
' Give him two arms to cling to '

349
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,347
No.

350
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:38,893
' And something warm to come to '

351
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,979
' When nights are cold ''

352
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,490
What the fuck is that?

353
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:09,132
Want to sit at the counter?

354
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,511
Hey. How ya doin'?

355
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:19,100
Listen. Uh, what's the story
with this incredibly, remarkably,

356
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:22,395
loud whistle
at 5:30 in the morning?

357
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,231
It's the steam whistle.
Oh.

358
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:28,735
Over at the sawmill.
Tell folks it's time to get up.

359
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:32,530
You can hear it for miles.

360
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,616
Y'all want something?
Yeah.

361
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:41,956
Hmm.

362
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:45,793
Breakfast?
Ya think?

363
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:48,171
Uh... Good choice.

364
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,340
Two.

365
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:00,516
Excuse me.

366
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:01,976
You guys down here...

367
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:05,355
hear about the ongoing
cholesterol problem in the country?

368
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:20,328
- What's-What's this over here?
- You never heard of grits?

369
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,373
Sure. Sure. I heard of grits.

370
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:26,918
I just actually never seen a grit before.

371
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,923
- Go ahead, honey. You gonna try it?
- You first.

372
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:40,390
- What is a grit anyways?
- It's made out of corn. Them hominy grits.

373
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:42,475
Hominy.

374
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,645
Hmm.

375
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:52,026
- How you cook it?
- Well, you simmer it in water
for 15 or 20 minutes.

376
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:55,113
Put it on the plate and add butter.

377
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,740
So? You gonna eat it or not?

378
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,269
Here?

379
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:47,874
Is your attorney here?
I am the attorney.

380
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:52,211
Oh. Jim Trotter III,
District Attorney,
Beechum County.

381
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:55,882
Vincent La Guardia Gambini I.
Brooklyn.

382
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:58,760
Nice to see you.

383
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,794
Yeah.

384
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,674
Vin.
Hey.

385
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:47,058
All rise for His Honor,
Judge Chamberlain Haller.

386
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:51,062
The court of Beechum County
is now in session.

387
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,024
Be seated.

388
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,530
First case.. The People
of the State of Alabama...

389
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:04,992
versus William Robert Gambini
and Stanley Marcus Rothenstein.

390
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:07,578
Stein. She called me "Stine."
Just-

391
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:12,708
Counselor, your clients are charged
with first-degree murder.
How do they plead?

392
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:16,003
- Your Honor, my clients...
- Don't talk to me sittin' in that chair.

393
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,592
Well, he told me to sit here.

394
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:24,470
When you're addressing this court,
you will rise...

395
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:27,598
and speak to me
in a clear, intelligible voice.

396
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:30,685
Sorry.

397
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,521
- My clients are...
- What are you wearin'?

398
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,566
Huh?

399
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:41,112
What are you wearin'?
I'm, uh, wearin', uh, clothes.

400
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,241
I-I-I don't get the question.

401
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:49,662
When you come into my court
looking like you do,

402
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,497
you not only insult me,

403
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:54,709
but you insult
the integrity of this court.

404
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,674
I apologize, sir,
but, uh, this is how I dress.

405
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:06,262
Next time
you come into my courtroom,
you will look lawyerly.

406
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:09,932
And I mean you comb your hair
and wear a suit and tie.

407
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:14,854
And that suit better
be made out of some kind of cloth.

408
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,397
You understand me?

409
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:20,067
Uh, yes. Uh, fine, Judge. Fine.
Good.

410
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,195
You may continue.
How do your clients plead?

411
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:26,991
Uh, my clients, caught
completely by surprise,

412
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:32,246
they thought
they were getting arrested
for, uh, shoplifting a can of tuna.

413
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:35,541
What are you telling me,
that they plead not guilty?

414
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:38,002
No. I'm-I'm just trying to explain.

415
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:42,924
I don't want to hear explanations.
The State of Alabama has its procedure.

416
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:46,636
And that procedure, at this point in time,
is to have an arraignment.

417
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,222
- Are we clear on this?
- Uh, yes.

418
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:52,475
But, uh, there seems to be
a great deal of confusion here.

419
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,520
- Mr. Gambini.
- See, my clients, uh-

420
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,522
Uh, Mr. Gambini.

421
00:30:57,606 --> 00:31:00,149
You want me
to come all the way?

422
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:03,819
Okay.

423
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:08,366
All I ask from you is a very simple
answer to a very simple question.

424
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:12,119
There are only two ways to answer it.
Guilty or not guilty.

425
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,456
Your Honor,
my clients didn't do anything.

426
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:18,501
Once again the communication process
is broken down.

427
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:25,508
It appears to me that you want
to skip the arraignment process,

428
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:31,013
go directly to trial,
skip that and get a dismissal.

429
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:38,187
Well, I'm not about to revamp
the entire judicial process...

430
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:42,275
just because you find yourself
in the unique position...

431
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:45,194
of defending clients
who say they didn't do it.

432
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:50,157
Now, next words out of your mouth are
either gonna be "guilty" or "not guilty."

433
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:54,954
I don't want to hear commentary,
argument or opinion.

434
00:31:55,038 --> 00:32:00,668
If I hear anything other than "guilty"
or "not guilty," you'll be in contempt.

435
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,879
I don't even want to hear you
clear your throat.

436
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,258
I hope I've been clear.

437
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:14,098
Now, how do your clients plead?

438
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,726
I think I get the point.

439
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:20,229
No, I don't think you do.

440
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:22,398
You're now in contempt of court.

441
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:26,068
Would you like to go
for two counts of contempt?

442
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:29,780
- Not guilty.
- Thank you.

443
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:33,242
Bail will be set at $200,000.

444
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:37,747
Preliminary hearing will be set
for 9:30 a.m. tomorrow morning.

445
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:43,794
Bailiff, please take
Mr. Gambini into custody.
His bail will be set at $200.

446
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:46,297
Come with me, please.

447
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:50,760
All rise as the judge leaves.

448
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,889
You have to bail me out.
You know that, right?

449
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,492
Hey, Tom!

450
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:16,702
Let's go.
Yeah, what you want, Junior?

451
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:35,513
They're gonna nuke
this guy Norton this weekend.

452
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:37,890
Looks like it.

453
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:41,686
You got one huge responsibility,
taking on this murder case.

454
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,146
You screw up,
and those boys get fried.

455
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:46,232
I know.

456
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:48,275
So you think you know
what you're doin'?

457
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,695
Yeah, I think I know what I'm doin'.

458
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:54,824
'Cause you didn't look like you knew
what you were doin' today
in that courtroom.

459
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,035
Why is that?
Well, it's a lot of procedure.
That's all.

460
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,330
I mean, I'll learn it as I go.
Learn as you go?

461
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,417
Yeah. Yeah.
Didn't they teach that
in law school?

462
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:10,047
No. That's not what they teach you.
They teach you contracts,
precedents, interpretations.

463
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:13,551
Then the firm that hires you,
they teach you procedures.

464
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:16,303
Or you could go to court
and watch.

465
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:19,098
So why didn't you
go to court and watch?

466
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:23,769
Because between your father's garage
and working nights,
when was I supposed to go?

467
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:27,440
I thought maybe this summer
I would take off a couple of months.

468
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:29,150
But it ain't no big deal.

469
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:33,195
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.

470
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:39,201
I don't know how you can be so sure
when you don't know what it is
you're supposed to know.

471
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:43,414
It's a procedure. Like rebuilding
a carburetor has a procedure.

472
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:47,626
You know when you rebuild a carburetor,
the first thing you do is you take
the carburetor off the manifold?

473
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:50,629
Supposing you skipped
the first step?

474
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:54,175
And, while you're replacing one of
the jets, you accidentally drop the jet.

475
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:58,262
It goes down the carburetor,
rolls along the manifold
and goes into the head. You're fucked.

476
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:01,974
You just learned the hard way
that you gotta remove
the carburetor first. Right?

477
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:05,019
So that's all
that happened to me today.
I learned the hard way.

478
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,313
Actually, it was
a good learning experience for me.

479
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:12,610
All right. Is there any way
I could help out
in this procedure situation?

480
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:15,321
Yeah. Keep bailing me out.

481
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:17,823
There is one problem.
We can't afford
to keep bailing you out.

482
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:19,825
I already cashed in
half the traveler's checks.

483
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,953
I didn't want to cash them in,
but I didn't want
to bounce a check,

484
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:27,500
so I tried hustling the money,
but I got stiffed, so I had to cash in
the traveler's checks.

485
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:31,045
What do you mean you got stiffed?
Did you say you got stiffed?

486
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:52,817
' 'Cause I'll always come back to you '

487
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,903
' If it ain't none of your business, baby '

488
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,322
' You better keep it... ''

489
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,974
Hey. Vincent La Guardia Gambini.

490
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:29,270
- His name's J.T.
- J.T.

491
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:35,150
I believe you and Lisa played
a game of pool for $200 which she won.
I'm here to collect.

492
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:40,239
- How about if I just kick your ass?
- Oh, a counteroffer.

493
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:44,910
That's what we lawyers...
I'm a lawyer-
We lawyers call that a counteroffer.

494
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:47,997
Let me see. This is
a tough decision
you give me here.

495
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:51,667
Get my ass kicked
or collect $200. Hmm.

496
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:55,296
What do you think?
I could use a good ass kicking.
I'll be very honest with you.

497
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,049
Hmm.

498
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:01,719
Nah, I think
I'll just go with the 200.

499
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,475
Over my dead body.

500
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,979
You like to renegotiate
as you go along, huh?

501
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,982
Okay, then here's my counteroffer.

502
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:20,487
Do I have to kill you?
What if I was just to kick
the ever-lovin' shit out of ya?

503
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:24,450
- In your dreams.
- Oh, no, no, no. In reality.

504
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:28,203
If I was to kick the shit out of you,
do I get the money?

505
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,710
If you kick the shit
out of me?

506
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,254
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Then you get the money.

507
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:43,886
- What happened? Rear-ended?
- No. I fell.

508
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,388
Oh. Okay.

509
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:48,974
Let's see if we agree
on the terms.

510
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:52,227
The choice now is
I get my ass kicked,

511
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:57,066
or option B,
I kick your ass
and collect the 200.

512
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:03,781
I'm going with option B:
kicking your ass
and collecting $200.

513
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,867
We gonna fight now?

514
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:08,953
Yeah. First, let me see the money.

515
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:12,748
- I have the money.
- All right. Let me see it.
Show it to me.

516
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:17,044
- I can get it.
- You can get it?

517
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,297
All right. Get it,
and then we'll fight.

518
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:29,014
Did you fall in your place
or somebody else's?

519
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:31,100
My place.
Shit.

520
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,855
He blew the arraignment.

521
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,191
It's a simple procedure.
You heard what the judge said.

522
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:42,194
All he had to do
was say "guilty" or "not guilty."
We could have done that.

523
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:46,073
- So? What are you saying?
- What am I saying?

524
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:50,786
You saw what happened in there.
You want to stay with him after that?

525
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,206
Shit, Stan.
I don't want to fire him.
I mean, he's family, you know.

526
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,417
My mother-
the way her health is right now-

527
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:01,005
I appreciate that,
but should you die for that?

528
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:03,090
Wouldn't your mother
be more upset if you die?

529
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:07,886
The thing is, given the chance,
I think he could do a good job.

530
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:11,140
- No. You're wrong.
- Come on, fellas.
Knock it off. Let's go.

531
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:16,353
All right, Stan.
Listen to me.
You have to see the Gambinis in action.

532
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:20,566
These people... they love to argue.
I mean, they live to argue.

533
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,110
My parents argue too.
That doesn't make them good lawyers.

534
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:27,156
Stan, I've seen your parents argue.
Trust me. They're amateurs.

535
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,043
Is that a drip I hear?

536
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,171
Yeah.

537
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:45,924
Weren't you the last one
to use the bathroom?

538
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:48,010
So?

539
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:50,137
Well, did you use the faucet?
Yeah.

540
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,392
- Then why didn't you turn it off?
- I did turn it off.

541
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:57,978
Well, if you turned it off,
why am I listening to it?

542
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:03,192
Did it ever occur to you it could be
turned off and drip at the same time?

543
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:05,402
No, because if you turned it off,
it wouldn't drip.

544
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:09,198
Maybe it's broken.
Is that what you're saying?
It's broken?

545
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:11,575
Yeah, that's it. It's broken.

546
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,370
You sure?

547
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:18,207
I'm positive.

548
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,960
Maybe you didn't
twist it hard enough.

549
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:26,381
- I twisted it just right.
- How could you be so sure?

550
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:34,223
If you will look in the manual,
you will see that this
particular model faucet...

551
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:37,893
requires a range
of 10 to 16 foot-pounds
of torque.

552
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,979
I routinely twist to
maximum allowable torquage.

553
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:44,483
How could you be sure you used
16 foot-pounds of torque?

554
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:48,445
Because I used
a Craftsman model 10-19,

555
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:52,783
laboratory edition,
signature series torque wrench.

556
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:57,830
The kind used by Caltech high-energy
physicists and NASA engineers.

557
00:40:57,914 --> 00:41:02,334
Well, in that case,
how could you be sure that's accurate?

558
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:07,923
Because a split second
before the torque wrench
was applied to the faucet handle,

559
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,801
it had been calibrated
by top members...

560
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:15,222
of the state and federal Department
of Weights and Measures...

561
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,016
to be dead-on balls accurate.

562
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:21,520
Here's a certificate of validation.

563
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,360
Dead-on balls accurate?

564
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,612
It's an industry term.

565
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,787
I guess the fuckin' thing is broken.

566
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:57,306
We gotta move.

567
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:02,686
Then I heard two loud bangs
like firecrackers.

568
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:07,941
I looked up and saw two young men
run out from the Sac-O-Suds...

569
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:13,238
and jump into a green car
with a white convertible top...

570
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:15,657
and drive off like the dickens.

571
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:21,330
Mrs. Riley, are those two young men
present in the courtroom today?
Yes, sir, they are.

572
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:26,126
- Could you point 'em
out for me, please, ma'am?
- They's sittin' right there.

573
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:32,466
Uh-huh. Now, uh,
Mrs. Riley, is this the car?

574
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:36,887
Yes, sir, it is.
Thank you, ma'am.

575
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:41,683
Let the record show
Mrs. Constance Riley
identified the defendant's car.

576
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:46,021
I was makin' my breakfast.

577
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:51,443
I saw them two boys
go into the store.

578
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,779
Then later, I heard a gunshot.

579
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:58,116
Looked out the window.

580
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:02,079
- They was runnin' out,
got into the car and drove off.

581
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,206
Is this the car?

582
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:10,545
Yes, it is.

583
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,673
Thank you, sir.

584
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:24,393
You saw those two boys
run out of the Sac-O-Suds,
jump in this car and take off?

585
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:28,355
Yeah. They peeled away.
Car was all over the road.
Thank you, sir.

586
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:35,654
I asked him if he did it,
and he said, "I shot the clerk."

587
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:41,076
I asked him again,
and again he said, "I shot the clerk."

588
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,913
Your Honor, no further questions.

589
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,583
- Mr. Gambini?
- Yes?

590
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:52,379
- You have anything to add?
- Thing? What thing?

591
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,423
Not for me to say.

592
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,467
Uh, no, sir.

593
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:02,764
You can stand down.

594
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:05,475
- Do you have any other witnesses?
- No, Your Honor.

595
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:10,605
The court finds sufficient evidence
exists for this matter to go to trial.

596
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:16,778
I'm setting this matter for trial
this Monday, February 2, 10:00 a.m.

597
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,783
- Mr. Gambini.

598
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:25,495
Stand up.

599
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:34,421
Now didn't I tell you next time
you appear in my courtroom
that you dress appropriately?

600
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:38,800
You were serious about that?

601
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,141
Why didn't you
ask them any questions?
Questions?

602
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,810
Ask who questions?

603
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:52,356
You knew you could ask questions,
didn't you, Vin?

604
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,859
Maybe if you put up some kind
of a fight, you could've gotten
the case thrown out.

605
00:44:55,943 --> 00:45:00,906
Hey, Stan, you're in Ala-fuckin'-bama.

606
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:04,951
You come from New York.
You killed a good ol' boy.

607
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:08,330
There is no way
this is not goin' to trial.

608
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:13,877
What the fuck
is goin' on here, Vinny?

609
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,921
You fuckin' up
this case or what?

610
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:19,383
I explained it to you already.
It’s just procedure.
I'm bound to fuck up a little.

611
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:22,344
A little?
You got thrown in jail. Twice.

612
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:26,598
Hey. I know I was in jail.
I don't need you to point it out
to me, okay?

613
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,975
I mean, you-you're my fiancée.

614
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,270
You're supposed to stand by your man,
you know, encourage me a little bit.

615
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:34,147
A little encouragement.

616
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,274
Is that what you want?
Yeah.

617
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:39,152
Oh, I'm sorry.
You were wonderful in there.

618
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:43,031
The way you handled that judge.
Oh, you are a smooth talker!

619
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:46,827
You are. You are.
All right. Knock it off.
Knock it off.

620
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:49,788
You think I like fuckin' up?
Is that it?

621
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:53,708
You know, you raggin' on me
is not gonna give me
any great spontaneous knowledge.

622
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:55,877
- Yeah?
- So shut it!

623
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,569
Fuck.

624
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:24,865
- You done readin'?
- Yeah.

625
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:29,035
You wanna go to bed?

626
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:34,207
I don't know.
I don't feel good.

627
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:37,669
You shouldn't feel good.
You haven't slept much in three days.

628
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,631
That's part of it.

629
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:44,217
You know what it is?

630
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:55,812
I'm, uh... I'm really scared.

631
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:59,483
You should be.

632
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:04,446
How the fuck
did I get into this shit?

633
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:08,033
"Oh, sure, no problem.
I could win the case."

634
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:11,036
I already got myself
sent to jail twice.

635
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:14,706
I could win this thing,
you know. I know I could.

636
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:18,418
If I could keep my ass awake
and out of jail long enough,
bet you I could, huh?

637
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,504
You know
what I think?
What?

638
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:25,550
Honestly?
I think that once you're out there,
and you're doing your thing out there,

639
00:47:25,635 --> 00:47:27,636
I think you're
gonna be really great.

640
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:32,098
Really great.

641
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:41,983
If... you don't fuck up.

642
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:26,069
If this was a conspiracy,
they'd have to get all those people to lie.

643
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:30,949
You think that's
what's happening?

644
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:37,664
Look, I think we should meet
with the public defender,
see what he's like.

645
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:41,751
If he's honest,
then we should go with him.

646
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:47,007
All right.

647
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,432
That's Death Row in there.

648
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:57,142
It is?

649
00:48:57,226 --> 00:48:59,269
The chair ain't
workin' like it used to.

650
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,396
The guy we fried last week-

651
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,399
took us three attempts,
and his head caught fire.

652
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:07,235
See, there's no money
in the budget
to get it looked at.

653
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,863
I say it'd be cheaper
to get it fixed...

654
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,198
than keep runnin' up them
extra electric bills.

655
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:25,754
Hi, Stanley.

656
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:28,423
My name is John Gibbons,

657
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:31,635
and I'm, um, an attorney
in the public defender's office.

658
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:33,803
Hi, John.
Hey.

659
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:38,391
Now, the evidence against you
is pretty strong.

660
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:43,438
So, um, why don't you just tell me
your side of the story?

661
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:56,701
Hey, Vin.

662
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:59,663
Hey. Billy.
How are you?

663
00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:01,998
How you feel? Okay?
All right. Hanging in.

664
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:06,586
Where's Stan?
Uh, Stan.
He's not comin'... Stan.

665
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:10,507
He's, um-

666
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:13,301
Well, he wants to go
with the public defender.

667
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,810
Listen, Vin. I-

668
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:25,230
I'm goin' with
the public defender too.

669
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:30,151
I'm sorry. I-I'm sorry.
I just didn't know what little
experience you have with this.

670
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:35,115
What, are you scared?

671
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:37,117
Yeah, I'm scared.

672
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:41,246
Look, maybe I could have handled
the preliminary a little better, okay?
I admit it.

673
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:44,958
But what's most important
is winnin' the case. I could do it.

674
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,335
I really could.

675
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:50,797
Let me tell you how, okay?
The D.A. has got to build a case.

676
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,800
Building a case
is like building a house.

677
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,594
Each piece of evidence
is just another building block.

678
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:59,013
He wants to make
a brick bunker of a building.

679
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:03,059
He wants to use serious,
solid-looking bricks like these, right?

680
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,061
Right.

681
00:51:05,146 --> 00:51:07,021
Let me show you something.

682
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:13,111
He's gonna show you the bricks.

683
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,613
He'll show you
they got straight sides.

684
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:18,283
He'll show you how
they got the right shape.

685
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:21,369
He'll show them to you
in a very special way...

686
00:51:21,454 --> 00:51:24,581
so that they appear to have
everything a brick should have.

687
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:27,417
But there's one thing
he's not gonna show you.

688
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,627
When you look at the bricks
at the right angle,

689
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:31,921
they're as thin
as this playing card.

690
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:36,009
His whole case is an illusion,
a magic trick.

691
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:39,679
It has to be an illusion,
'cause you're innocent.

692
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:43,767
Nobody- I mean nobody-

693
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:47,812
pulls the wool over the eyes
of a Gambini, especially this one.

694
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:50,315
Give me the chance.

695
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,317
One chance.

696
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:54,652
Let me question the first witness.

697
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:59,282
If after that point you don't think
that I'm the best man for the job,
fire me then and there.

698
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:02,368
I'll leave quietly, no grudges.

699
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:04,913
All I ask is for that one chance.

700
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:08,792
I think you should give it to me.

701
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:13,963
He thinks you should give it to him?

702
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:16,424
What was he before he was a lawyer,
a fuckin' comedian?

703
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:19,677
How can it hurt?
If he doesn't ask the right questions,
your lawyer will, right?

704
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:21,471
He could still fuck things up.

705
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:24,015
There's more to cross-examination
than knowing what to say.

706
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:26,476
It's knowing what not to say.

707
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,270
Look, let's say he asks
all the possible questions, right?

708
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:33,358
And the witness has all the answers.
He ends up proving the prosecution's case.

709
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:37,612
How did he ever talk you into it?

710
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:45,912
At my cousin Ruthie's wedding,
the groom's brother
was that guy Alakazam.

711
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,164
You know
who I'm talking about?

712
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,291
The magician with the ponytail?
Right.

713
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:54,879
Well, he did his act. Every time
he made something disappear,
Vinny jumped on him.

714
00:52:54,964 --> 00:52:57,257
I mean, he nailed him.
It was, "It's in his pocket."

715
00:52:57,341 --> 00:53:00,760
Or, "He's palming it."
Or, "There's a mirror
under the table."

716
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:04,055
He was like, "Wait a second.
Wait a second.
It’s joined in the middle.

717
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,975
There's a spring around it.
It pops it open when
it's inside the tube."

718
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:11,437
I mean, it was...
it was Alakazam's
worst nightmare.

719
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:14,232
But he was just being Vinny.

720
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:17,527
He was just being
the quintessential Gambini.

721
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:30,164
There goes
the quintessential Norton.

722
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:36,796
Lookee here, J.T.

723
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:47,015
Hey, hey, little Yankee boy.
Look here what I got.

724
00:53:48,017 --> 00:53:49,851
What is it?

725
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:52,854
Two hundred dollars.

726
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:55,648
Bring it here. Let me see it.

727
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:05,658
Hmm.

728
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:10,413
How do I know that's not a bunch of ones
with a 20 wrapped around it?

729
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:15,501
- It's 200 bucks.
- Fan it out. Show it to me.

730
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:22,383
Yeah, right.

731
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:45,740
Mmm.

732
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:49,095
Does that freight train
come through at 5:00 a.m.
every morning?

733
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,347
No, sir. It's very unusual.

734
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:54,142
Okay.

735
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:57,770
I was making a lot of money,
winning most of my cases.

736
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:00,189
Excuse me, Mr. Trotter.
Thank you, Shirley.

737
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:02,358
But my clients were guilty as hell.

738
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:06,863
And finally, after getting this one fellow off
some very serious charges
for about the fourth time,

739
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:09,157
I tell you the truth...
my conscience got to me.

740
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:12,994
Wouldn't I be better off serving justice
by puttin' the guilty in jail?

741
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:16,622
Well, that's what I've been doing,
and, uh, I'm a happier man for it.

742
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:19,292
Hmm.
How about you?

743
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,502
Well, I got a bullshit traffic ticket.

744
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:23,379
I went to court.

745
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:27,216
I got the cop on the stand, and I argued
with him until he admitted he was wrong.

746
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:32,430
And, uh, the judge-
this Judge Malloy-

747
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:35,099
all the while,
he's laughin' and smilin'.

748
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:39,187
And then afterwards,
he asked me to go
to lunch with him.

749
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:42,273
Then he says to me,
"You know what?
You'd be a good litigator."

750
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:45,651
I don't know
what the hell he was talking about.
I don't know what a litigator is.

751
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:50,198
I never thought of becoming a lawyer.

752
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:52,408
But this Judge Malloy
was from Brooklyn too.

753
00:56:52,493 --> 00:56:56,621
I mean, he did it,
so all of a sudden it seemed possible.

754
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,664
So I went to law school.

755
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:01,751
Then, from time to time,
he would come by,

756
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:05,838
see how I was doin',
if I needed anything.

757
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:08,091
He was a nice man.

758
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:11,177
I mean, to go out of his way
like that for me, you know?

759
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:16,474
He wanted his son
to follow in his footsteps,
but he became a musician or something.

760
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:20,728
I remember when I graduated,
he was so proud of me.

761
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:25,274
That's quite a story.
Yeah.

762
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,653
So, we got some case
ahead of us here, huh?
Oh, yeah.

763
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:31,155
How do you feel about it?
Oh.

764
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,700
Well, I'd... I'd like to have
the murder weapon.

765
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:37,203
But other than that,
I feel pretty good.

766
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:40,832
- You do?
- Oh, yeah.

767
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:44,752
- Hmm.
- Hey, what are you doing this afternoon?

768
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:48,506
- You're going hunting?
- That's right.

769
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:52,260
Why are you goin' huntin'?
Shouldn't you be out preparin' for court?

770
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:54,679
I was thinkin' last night.

771
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:56,931
If only I knew
what he knows, you know?

772
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:00,351
If he let me look at his files-
Oh, boy.

773
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:04,897
Well, I don't get it.
What has gettin' to Trotter's files
have anything to do with hunting?

774
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:09,944
Well, you know,
two guys out in the woods,
guns, on the hunt.

775
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:13,406
It's a bonding thing, you know?
Show him I'm one of the boys.

776
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,742
He's not gonna let me look at his
files, but maybe he'll relax enough...

777
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:21,080
to drop his guard so that I can finesse
a little information out of him.

778
00:58:22,374 --> 00:58:25,168
What am I gonna wear?
What are you gonna hunt?

779
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:29,088
I don't know. He's got, uh...
He's got a lot
of stuffed heads in his office.

780
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:31,299
Heads?

781
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:33,926
What kind of heads?
I don't know.

782
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:38,014
- He's got a boar, a bear, a couple of deer.
- Whoa. You're gonna shoot a deer?

783
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:44,103
I don't know. I suppose.
I mean, I'm a man's man.
I could go deer huntin'.

784
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:49,442
A sweet, innocent, harmless,
leaf-eatin', doe-eyed, little deer.

785
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:53,696
Hey, Lisa, I'm not gonna go
out there just to wimp out,
you know?

786
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:57,116
I mean, the guy will lose respect for me.
Would you rather have that?

787
00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:06,751
What about these pants I got on?
You think they're okay?

788
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:10,296
Oh!

789
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,592
Imagine you're a deer.

790
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:17,595
You're prancin' along.
You get thirsty.

791
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,639
You spot a little brook.

792
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:24,101
You put your little deer lips
down to the cool, clear water.

793
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:27,104
Bam! A fuckin' bullet rips off
part of your head!

794
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:30,524
Your brains are laying
on the ground
in little bloody pieces.

795
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:33,277
Now I ask you, would you give
a fuck what kind of pants...

796
00:59:33,362 --> 00:59:36,197
the son of a bitch
who shot you was wearing?

797
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,212
I'd sure like to get
a look at your files.

798
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:53,881
You would?
Sure.

799
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:57,510
You got a Xerox machine
over there?
Uh, no.

800
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:01,722
Oh, that's okay.
I'll have my secretary do it.

801
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:04,976
Shirley, can you xerox
all the files...

802
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:09,272
on the Gambini/Rothenstein case
for Mr. Gambini?

803
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:11,732
Yeah.
Thank you, sweetheart.

804
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:24,036
What's all that?
Trotter's files, all of 'em.

805
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:27,456
You stole his files?
I didn't steal his files.

806
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:28,749
Listen to this.

807
01:00:28,834 --> 01:00:32,336
I'm just waiting to finesse him.
I'm startin' to finesse him.
I got him goin'.

808
01:00:32,421 --> 01:00:36,090
He offers to have his secretary
copy everything for me.

809
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:39,302
That's very impressive finessing.

810
01:00:39,386 --> 01:00:41,220
That's not all.

811
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:44,098
He's lettin' us use
his hunting cabin
as soon as he gets back.

812
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:47,977
It's in the woods. It's quiet.
He sleeps like a baby
when he's there.

813
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:49,812
Terrific.
You're a hell of a bonder.

814
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:55,359
What's this?
You, uh, readin' this book?

815
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,738
Yeah.
Do me a favor, okay?
Don't read this book.

816
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,657
Okay?
Thank you very much.

817
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:03,743
All right.

818
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,330
Don't you wanna know why
Trotter gave you his files?

819
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:09,832
I told you why already.

820
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:14,879
He has to, by law. You're entitled.
It's called "disclosure," you dickhead.

821
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:16,922
He has to show you everything.

822
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:18,966
Otherwise, it could be a mistrial.

823
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:23,429
He has to give you a list
of all his witnesses.
You can talk to all his witnesses.

824
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,848
He's not allowed any surprises.

825
01:01:27,726 --> 01:01:30,102
They didn't teach you that
in law school either?

826
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:39,445
Now let me ask you this.

827
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:42,490
How many different
levels of thickness
have you gone through?

828
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:45,951
What'd you have for breakfast?
Well-

829
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:49,413
What's that brown stuff?

830
01:01:49,498 --> 01:01:51,457
Huh?

831
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:19,819
Yesterday, you told me
that freight train hardly ever
comes through here...

832
01:02:19,945 --> 01:02:22,071
at 5:00 a.m. in the morning.
I know.

833
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,532
She's supposed to come through
at 10 after 4:00.

834
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:33,040
Can you participate in an endeavor
in which the ultimate decision
might be death by electrocution?

835
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:35,876
Ma'am?

836
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:40,214
I think it should be
left up to the victims' families
rather than the courts.

837
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:44,552
Uh-huh.
Uh, the defendants in this case...

838
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:47,430
are charged with robbing
a convenience store,

839
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:51,851
and then, in a most cowardly fashion,
shootin' the clerk in the back.

840
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:57,314
Now, if sufficient evidence is offered
to prove these facts,
you think you could...

841
01:02:57,399 --> 01:02:58,732
Fry 'em.

842
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:01,902
She'll do.

843
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,497
Hmm.

844
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:21,338
Mr. Gambini.

845
01:03:21,423 --> 01:03:24,049
Come in, come in.

846
01:03:33,268 --> 01:03:37,438
I just got a fax
from the New York State Office
of Judicial Records...

847
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:42,610
that they have no records...

848
01:03:42,694 --> 01:03:47,865
of any Vincent Gambini
ever trying any case
in the entire state of New York.

849
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:51,577
Uh, you're not gonna find
any, uh- any records...

850
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:54,580
of Vincent La Guardia Gambini
practicing in any courts.

851
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:56,665
I just told you that.
You don't understand.

852
01:03:56,750 --> 01:04:00,544
See, 20 years ago,
I became a actor.

853
01:04:00,629 --> 01:04:05,132
And there was this very prominent
stage actor in New York.
His name was Vincent Gambini.

854
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:07,176
Maybe you heard of him.
No.

855
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,178
Never heard of him?
Doesn't matter. Anyway,

856
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:13,015
I had to change my name,
which I did, legally.

857
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:17,144
- So now I practice law under
my legally changed stage name.
- What name is that?

858
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:20,105
Jerry Gal-

859
01:04:22,234 --> 01:04:23,859
Jerry Gallo.

860
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:31,116
You can still call me Gambini.

861
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:36,455
Sorry.

862
01:04:37,499 --> 01:04:41,085
And what name
did you tell him?
Jerry Gallo.

863
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:43,587
Jerry Gallo?
The big attorney?

864
01:04:43,672 --> 01:04:46,840
Yeah.
Think that was
a smart move?

865
01:04:46,925 --> 01:04:49,510
Yeah, well, the man is
a seriously accomplished lawyer.

866
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:52,137
He checks up on this guy,
his name will show up
all over the place.

867
01:04:52,264 --> 01:04:54,974
His name was in the papers
all last week.
Yeah, I saw that.

868
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:57,017
But you didn't actually
read the articles.

869
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,562
No.
That's too bad.

870
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:02,523
Why is that?
'Cause he's dead.

871
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:23,460
What's the matter with you?

872
01:05:23,545 --> 01:05:25,546
I don't know.

873
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:32,219
- You're acting like
you're nervous or somethin'.
- Well, yeah, I am.

874
01:05:32,304 --> 01:05:34,471
What are you nervous about?
I'm the one under the gun here.

875
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:37,683
Trial starts tomorrow.
You wanna know
what I'm nervous about?

876
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:41,604
I'll tell you what I'm nervous about.
I am in the dark here
with all this legal crap.

877
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:46,775
I have no idea what's going on.
All's I know is you're
screwin' up, and I can't help.

878
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:48,819
You lent me your little camera,
didn't you?

879
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:51,780
Oh, Vinny, I'm watchin' you
go down in flames,

880
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:54,700
and you're bringing me with you,
and I can't do anything about it.

881
01:05:56,328 --> 01:05:58,871
And?
Well, I hate to bring it up,

882
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,707
because you got enough pressure
on you already, but...

883
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:04,251
we agreed to get married
as soon as you won your first case.

884
01:06:04,336 --> 01:06:07,004
Meanwhile, 10 years later,
my niece,

885
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:09,340
the daughter of my sister,
is gettin' married.

886
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:12,301
My biological clock is tickin' like this,

887
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:16,013
and the way this case is goin',
I ain't never gettin' married!

888
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:18,557
Lisa, I don't need this.

889
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:22,519
I swear to God,
I do not need this right now, okay?

890
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:26,649
I got a judge that’s just achin'
to throw me in jail,

891
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:30,861
an idiot who wants to fight me
for $200, slaughtered pigs,

892
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:33,656
giant, loud whistles.

893
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,783
I ain't slept in five days.

894
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:38,494
I got no money,
a dress-code problem,

895
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:41,455
and a little murder case which,
in the balance,

896
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:43,666
holds the lives of two innocent kids,

897
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:49,421
not to mention your...
biological clock,
my career'

898
01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:52,049
your life, our marriage,
and let me see...

899
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,801
What else could we pile on?

900
01:06:53,885 --> 01:06:59,223
Is there any more shit we could pile on
to the top of the outcome of this case?

901
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:01,475
Is it possible?

902
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:06,689
Maybe it was a bad time
to bring it up.

903
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:28,043
- What the fuck is that?

904
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,157
This is very romantic...

905
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:04,788
out here in this field,
under the stars,

906
01:08:04,873 --> 01:08:07,291
quiet,

907
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:10,002
no one around for miles.

908
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:14,214
It's very romantic.

909
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:19,845
I don't see no stars.

910
01:08:35,987 --> 01:08:38,822
Oh, honey, move.

911
01:08:38,907 --> 01:08:40,908
My back. Wait.

912
01:08:42,202 --> 01:08:44,203
I gotta get up.

913
01:08:45,747 --> 01:08:47,915
Just let me-

914
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:51,126
This fucking jacket!

915
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:54,296
Hey!
Ohh.

916
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,422
Oh.

917
01:09:09,938 --> 01:09:11,313
Fuck!

918
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:40,592
Okay.

919
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:02,739
- Whoa!
- You okay?

920
01:10:02,866 --> 01:10:06,451
What was in that pink
plastic thing in the trunk?
It's your suit.

921
01:10:07,662 --> 01:10:09,580
What is my suit
doin' in the trunk?

922
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:13,876
I had it cleaned.
I thought it would be a nice surprise-
go in there with a nice clean suit.

923
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:24,803
Got 30 fucking minutes
to take a shower,

924
01:10:24,888 --> 01:10:27,931
get a new suit, get dressed
and get to the fuckin' courthouse.

925
01:10:28,016 --> 01:10:29,933
You fuckin' shower.
I'll get your fuckin' suit.

926
01:10:30,018 --> 01:10:31,768
Hey, hey!
Little Yankee wuss!

927
01:10:31,853 --> 01:10:34,855
Lookee here.
I got your $200.

928
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:38,859
You gonna kick the shit
outta me now?

929
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:30,744
- Well, here he comes.

930
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:49,346
Mr. Gambini,

931
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:51,765
are you mocking me
with that outfit?

932
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:55,519
Mocking you?
No, I'm not mocking you, Judge.

933
01:11:55,603 --> 01:11:58,146
Then explain that... outfit.

934
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:05,737
I bought a suit. You've seen it.
Now it's covered in mud.

935
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:08,115
This town doesn't have
a one-hour cleaners,

936
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:10,158
so I had to buy a new suit.

937
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:13,829
Except that the only store
you could buy a new suit in
has got the flu.

938
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:17,374
You get that?
The whole store got the flu.

939
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:20,752
So I had to get this
in a secondhand store.

940
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:22,421
So...

941
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:24,798
it's either wear the leatherjacket,

942
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:28,176
which I know you hate, or this.

943
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:34,433
So I wore this
ridiculous thing for you.

944
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:39,938
Are you on drugs?

945
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,442
Drugs? No, I don't take drugs.

946
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:47,112
- I don't like your attitude.
- What else is new?

947
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:51,241
- I'm holdin' you in contempt of court.
- There's a fuckin' surprise.

948
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:54,119
- What'd you say?
- What?

949
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:55,829
What'd you just say?

950
01:12:57,582 --> 01:13:00,125
What'd I say? What?

951
01:13:04,005 --> 01:13:09,593
Uh, Your Honor, counsel,
members of the jury,

952
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:12,763
the evidence in this case
is gonna show...

953
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:15,557
that at 9:30 in the morning
of January 4,

954
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:19,853
both defendants,
Stanley Rothenstein
and William Gambini,

955
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:23,190
were seen gettin' out
of their metallic green...

956
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:27,903
1964 Buick Skylark convertible
with a white top.

957
01:13:27,987 --> 01:13:30,614
The evidence is gonna show
that they were seen entering...

958
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:34,743
the Sac-O-Suds convenience store
in Wahzoo City.

959
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:39,331
The evidence is gonna show
that minutes after
they entered the Sac-O-Suds,

960
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:43,085
a gunshot was heard
by three eyewitnesses.

961
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:47,464
You're gonna then hear
the testimony
of the three eyewitnesses...

962
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:50,092
who saw the defendants
running out of the Sac-O-Suds...

963
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:52,677
a moment after
the shots were heard,

964
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:57,557
gettin' into their faded,
metallic green 1964 Buick Skylark...

965
01:13:57,642 --> 01:13:59,893
and driving off in great haste.

966
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:02,395
Finally, the state is gonna prove...

967
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:06,233
that the defendants,
Gambini and Rothenstein,

968
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:11,655
admitted, then recanted, their testimony
to the sheriff of Beechum County.

969
01:14:11,739 --> 01:14:13,907
Now let's get down
to the link lock.

970
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:16,618
Your verdict is gonna depend...

971
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:20,163
on what you think
of the sworn testimony.

972
01:14:20,248 --> 01:14:22,833
Not what I think.
What I think don't count.

973
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:26,920
You're the jury. It's your job
to decide who's telling the truth.

974
01:14:27,004 --> 01:14:31,174
Truth.
That's what "verdict" means.

975
01:14:31,259 --> 01:14:33,385
It's a word comes down
from old England...

976
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,428
and all our little old ancestors.

977
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:40,142
Now, we're gonna be asking you
to return a verdict...

978
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:43,478
of murder in the first degree
for William Gambini...

979
01:14:45,148 --> 01:14:50,318
and a verdict of accessory
to murder in the first degree...

980
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:52,571
for Stanley Rothenstein...

981
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:55,490
for helping Gambini...

982
01:14:55,575 --> 01:14:58,577
commit this heinous crime.

983
01:15:08,171 --> 01:15:11,464
Counselor, do you wish
to make an opening statement?

984
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:15,802
Counselor?

985
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:24,603
Vinny. Vinny.
What?

986
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:28,690
Come on. It's time to make
your opening statement.
Come on, Vin.

987
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:38,992
Uh, everything that guy just said
is bullshit. Thank you.

988
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:43,914
Objection, Your Honor.
Counsel's entire
opening statement is argument.

989
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:47,375
Objection sustained.
The entire opening statement,

990
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:51,630
with the exception of “Thank you,"
will be stricken from the record.

991
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:57,052
The jury will please disregard
counsel's entire opening statement.

992
01:15:58,346 --> 01:16:00,305
And you, Mr. Gambini-

993
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:05,101
You will not use that kind
of language in my court.
You understand me?

994
01:16:05,186 --> 01:16:07,646
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

995
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:11,691
Putz.

996
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:17,864
Counselor?
Your statement, sir.

997
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:39,135
Well, now, uh,

998
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:43,139
ladies and gentlemen of the j-j-j-

999
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:46,643
of-of-of-of the j-j-j...

1000
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:50,272
jury!

1001
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:54,234
Um, on-on...
on-on...

1002
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:57,696
on January f-f-f-f-

1003
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:01,908
f-f-f-f-f-f-f-fourth of this year,

1004
01:17:01,993 --> 01:17:04,661
my client did indeed visit...

1005
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:07,956
the Sac-O-Suds con-con-

1006
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,667
um, um,

1007
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:13,586
um, convenience store.

1008
01:17:13,671 --> 01:17:16,548
But... But...

1009
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:22,304
he didn't, um-
kill anyone.

1010
01:17:22,388 --> 01:17:26,766
He-He, uh, um, uh-

1011
01:17:29,103 --> 01:17:31,521
We-We intend to prove...

1012
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:33,898
that the p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-

1013
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:38,820
prosecution's case is circumstantial...

1014
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:41,573
and-and-and-and-and-

1015
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:46,494
Oh! Uh, coincidental.

1016
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:48,580
Thank you.

1017
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:03,636
That's it? What about
everything we talked about?

1018
01:18:03,763 --> 01:18:07,474
I get a little nervous sometimes.
I'm gettin' better.
A little nervous?

1019
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:11,227
I heard a gunshot,
so I looked out the window,

1020
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:14,606
and I seen them two boys run out,

1021
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:17,942
get into their car
and drive off like maniacs,

1022
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:21,196
tires screeching, smoking,
going up on the curb.

1023
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:25,241
Is this the car?
Yes, sir.

1024
01:18:25,326 --> 01:18:28,870
Thank you, sir.
No further questions,
Your Honor.

1025
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:30,955
Your witness.

1026
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:39,756
All right. Mr., uh, T-T-T-T-T-T-

1027
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,841
uh... um-

1028
01:18:41,926 --> 01:18:44,844
uh, T-T-T... uh, Tipton!

1029
01:18:44,929 --> 01:18:47,722
Now, when you
viewed my clients,

1030
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:49,891
how-how-how far away were you?

1031
01:18:50,017 --> 01:18:53,395
About 50 feet.
Oh, now, do you think
that's close enough...

1032
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:57,649
to make an accurate, uh, i-

1033
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:00,443
i-i-i-i-i-i-i...

1034
01:19:00,528 --> 01:19:02,070
identification?

1035
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:03,530
Yes.

1036
01:19:06,826 --> 01:19:09,702
Mr. Tipton, I see
you wear eyeglasses.

1037
01:19:09,829 --> 01:19:14,874
Sometimes.
Would you care to show those eyeglasses
to the jury, please? Thank you.

1038
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:21,840
Thank you. Now, Mr. Tipton,
were you wearing them that day?

1039
01:19:21,966 --> 01:19:24,008
No.
You see,

1040
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:28,513
you were 50 feet away,
you made a positive
eyewitness identification,

1041
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:32,767
and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and yet,

1042
01:19:32,852 --> 01:19:36,813
you were not wearing
your necessary
prescription eyeglasses?

1043
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:39,274
They're readin' glasses.

1044
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:49,868
Um-

1045
01:19:51,871 --> 01:19:57,250
Well, um, uh,
Mr., uh, uh, uh, uh-

1046
01:19:57,334 --> 01:19:59,252
Could you tell the court...

1047
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:04,424
what color eyes
the-the-the defendants have?

1048
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:09,554
Brown. Hazel green.

1049
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:15,435
No more questions.

1050
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:23,276
Mr. Gambini, your witness.

1051
01:20:23,402 --> 01:20:26,613
He's a tough one.
Yes.

1052
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:30,783
Mr. Tipton,

1053
01:20:30,868 --> 01:20:34,537
when you viewed the defendants
walking from their car...

1054
01:20:34,622 --> 01:20:37,790
into the Sac-O-Suds,
what angle was
your point of view?

1055
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:42,170
They was kinda walkin' toward me
when they entered the store.

1056
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:44,506
And when they left,
what angle was your point of view?

1057
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:47,175
They was kinda
walkin' away from me.

1058
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:53,139
So would you say you got
a better shot of them going in
and not so much comin' out?

1059
01:20:53,224 --> 01:20:56,935
- You could say that.
- I did say that. Would you say that?

1060
01:20:57,019 --> 01:21:02,106
- Yeah.
- Is it possible the two "youts"-

1061
01:21:02,191 --> 01:21:04,150
The two what?

1062
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:10,907
Wh-Wh-What was that word?
Uh, what word?

1063
01:21:11,033 --> 01:21:12,992
Two what?
What?

1064
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:16,496
- Did you say "youts"?
- Yeah, two "youts."

1065
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:20,750
- What is a "yout"?
- Oh. Excuse me, Your Honor.

1066
01:21:20,834 --> 01:21:22,460
Two youths.

1067
01:21:29,677 --> 01:21:34,180
Is it possible the two defendants
entered the store,

1068
01:21:34,265 --> 01:21:37,433
picked 22 specific items
off of the shelves,

1069
01:21:37,518 --> 01:21:41,020
had the clerk take money,
make change,

1070
01:21:41,105 --> 01:21:45,608
then leave...
then two different men
drive up in a similar-

1071
01:21:45,693 --> 01:21:47,902
Don't shake your head.
I'm not done yet.

1072
01:21:47,987 --> 01:21:50,154
Wait till you hear the whole thing
so you can understand this now.

1073
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:53,825
Two different men drive up
in a similar-looking car,

1074
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:58,454
go in, shoot the clerk,
rob him and then leave?

1075
01:21:58,539 --> 01:22:01,082
No. They didn't have enough time.

1076
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:03,042
Well, how much time
was they in the store?

1077
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:05,753
Five minutes.
Five minutes? Are you sure?

1078
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:07,797
Did you look at your watch?
No.

1079
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:13,136
Oh, I'm sorry.
You testified earlier that
the boys went into the store...

1080
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:15,388
and you had just begun
to make breakfast.

1081
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:18,349
You were just ready to eat,
and you heard a gunshot.
That's right. I'm sorry.

1082
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:20,727
So obviously,
it takes you five minutes
to make breakfast.

1083
01:22:20,853 --> 01:22:23,271
That's right.
So you knew that.

1084
01:22:23,397 --> 01:22:26,357
Uh, do you remember
what you had?
Eggs and grits.

1085
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:28,526
Eggs and grits.
I like grits too.

1086
01:22:28,611 --> 01:22:30,820
How do you cook your grits?

1087
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:32,905
You like 'em regular,
creamy or al dente?

1088
01:22:35,659 --> 01:22:38,369
Just regular, I guess.

1089
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:40,330
Regular. Instant grits?

1090
01:22:40,414 --> 01:22:43,124
No self-respecting Southerner
uses instant grits.

1091
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:45,293
I take pride in my grits.

1092
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:48,588
So, Mr. Tipton,

1093
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:53,593
how could it take you five minutes
to cook your grits...

1094
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:59,307
when it takes the entire
grit-eating world 20 minutes?

1095
01:23:05,064 --> 01:23:07,982
I don't know.
I'm a fast cook, I guess.

1096
01:23:08,067 --> 01:23:10,568
I'm sorry. I was all the way over here.
I couldn't hear you.

1097
01:23:10,653 --> 01:23:12,612
Did you say you're a fast cook?
That's it?

1098
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:19,077
Are we to believe that
boiling water soaks into a grit...

1099
01:23:19,161 --> 01:23:24,040
faster in your kitchen than on
any place on the face of the Earth?

1100
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:25,750
I don't know.

1101
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:31,047
Well, perhaps the laws of physics
cease to exist on your stove.

1102
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:33,424
Were these magic grits?

1103
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:38,596
I mean, did you buy them
from the same guy
who sold Jack his beanstalk beans?

1104
01:23:38,681 --> 01:23:40,973
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Objection sustained.

1105
01:23:41,058 --> 01:23:43,101
- You sure about five minutes?
- Ignore the question.
- I don't know.

1106
01:23:43,185 --> 01:23:45,395
- Are you sure about that five minutes?
- I don't know.

1107
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:48,940
- I think you made your point.
- Are you sure about that five minutes?

1108
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:55,530
I may have been mistaken.

1109
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:58,658
I got no more use for this guy.

1110
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:09,711
You're fired.

1111
01:24:09,795 --> 01:24:11,796
I want him!

1112
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:16,008
Come on, now. Move it.

1113
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:17,343
Don't worry.

1114
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:19,679
I'll find a way
to bail you out.
No, don't.

1115
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:24,183
I'm gonna stay in prison tonight.
Maybe I'll finally get some sleep.
I'm doin' good, huh?

1116
01:24:42,745 --> 01:24:44,579
Hey, how ya doin'?

1117
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:47,331
Hey, Mr. Crane.

1118
01:24:47,416 --> 01:24:50,209
What are these pictures of?

1119
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:54,881
My house and stuff.
House and stuff.

1120
01:24:54,965 --> 01:24:59,677
And what is this brown stuff
on the windows?

1121
01:24:59,803 --> 01:25:02,346
Dirt.
Dirt?

1122
01:25:04,141 --> 01:25:09,395
What is this rusty, dusty,
dirty-looking thing over your window?

1123
01:25:11,315 --> 01:25:14,275
It's a screen.
A screen!

1124
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:15,985
It's a screen.

1125
01:25:16,069 --> 01:25:21,657
And what are these really big things
right in the middle of your view...

1126
01:25:21,742 --> 01:25:24,994
from the window of your kitchen
to the Sac-O-Suds?

1127
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:27,955
What do we call these big things?

1128
01:25:30,501 --> 01:25:34,587
Trees?
Trees. That's right. Don't be afraid.
Just shout 'em right out when you know.

1129
01:25:34,671 --> 01:25:40,426
Now, what are these thousands
of little things that are on trees?

1130
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:44,305
Leaves.
Leaves!

1131
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:49,852
- And these bushy things
between the trees?

1132
01:25:49,937 --> 01:25:53,105
Bushes.
Bushes, right.
So, Mr. Crane,

1133
01:25:54,107 --> 01:25:57,610
you could positively identify
the defendants,

1134
01:25:57,694 --> 01:25:59,904
for a moment of two seconds,

1135
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:03,699
lookin' through
this dirty window,

1136
01:26:03,784 --> 01:26:06,744
this crud-covered screen,

1137
01:26:06,829 --> 01:26:11,374
these trees with
all these leaves on them,

1138
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:13,751
and, I don't know,
how many bushes?

1139
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:21,968
Looks like five.
Uh-uh. Don't forget
this one and this one.

1140
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:25,972
Seven bushes.
Seven bushes.
So, what do you think?

1141
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:29,100
Is it possible you just saw
two guys in a green convertible...

1142
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:33,688
and not necessarily
these two particular guys?

1143
01:26:35,107 --> 01:26:38,860
- Well, I suppose.
- I'm finished with this guy.

1144
01:26:46,994 --> 01:26:52,748
- Mrs. Riley, when you saw the defendants,
were you wearing your glasses?
- Yes, I was.

1145
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:54,876
Over here, dear.

1146
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:01,132
Would you mind puttin'
your glasses on for us, please?

1147
01:27:06,805 --> 01:27:09,599
Whoa! How long
have you been wearin' glasses?

1148
01:27:09,683 --> 01:27:11,434
Since I was six.

1149
01:27:11,518 --> 01:27:13,227
Have they always been that thick?

1150
01:27:13,312 --> 01:27:16,689
Oh, no.
They got thicker over the years.

1151
01:27:16,773 --> 01:27:20,651
So as your eyes have gotten
more and more out of whack...

1152
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:24,280
as you've gotten older,
how many different levels
of thickness have you gone through?

1153
01:27:24,364 --> 01:27:26,866
Oh, I don't know.

1154
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:30,870
Over 60 years,
maybe 10 times.

1155
01:27:30,954 --> 01:27:33,039
Maybe you're ready for a thicker set.

1156
01:27:33,123 --> 01:27:37,418
Oh, no, no.
I-I think they're okay.

1157
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:39,712
Maybe we should make sure.
Let's check it out.

1158
01:27:44,968 --> 01:27:48,304
Now, how far were
the defendants from you...

1159
01:27:48,388 --> 01:27:51,098
when you saw them
entering the Sac-O-Suds?

1160
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:53,100
About a hundred feet.

1161
01:27:53,185 --> 01:27:55,853
A hundred feet.
Would you hold this please?

1162
01:27:55,938 --> 01:27:58,105
Thank you.

1163
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:02,193
Sorry. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

1164
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:04,195
Sorry. Sorry.

1165
01:28:06,907 --> 01:28:09,992
Okay, this is 50 feet.

1166
01:28:10,077 --> 01:28:12,787
That's half the distance.

1167
01:28:12,871 --> 01:28:15,081
How many fingers am I holding up?

1168
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:20,294
Let the record show that counsel
is holding up two fingers.

1169
01:28:21,421 --> 01:28:23,339
Your Honor, please, huh?

1170
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:26,801
Oh. Sorry.

1171
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:32,473
Now, Mrs. Riley...
and only Mrs. Riley...

1172
01:28:34,142 --> 01:28:37,269
how many fingers
am I holding up now?

1173
01:28:42,275 --> 01:28:43,526
Four.

1174
01:28:49,533 --> 01:28:51,909
What do you think now, dear?

1175
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:56,122
I'm thinking of gettin'
thicker glasses.

1176
01:28:56,206 --> 01:28:58,457
Thank you.

1177
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:12,722
- Hello?
- You did good out there today, Yankee.
I like the competition.

1178
01:29:12,806 --> 01:29:15,433
You like competition too?
Makes things kind of fun, doesn't it?

1179
01:29:15,517 --> 01:29:19,478
- I'm enjoying myself so far.
- I got a little surprise for you tomorrow.

1180
01:29:19,563 --> 01:29:23,399
What's that?
You know you have to disclose
all your evidence to me.

1181
01:29:23,483 --> 01:29:25,860
Well, I just got it myself tonight.

1182
01:29:25,944 --> 01:29:29,196
I'll disclose it first thing in the morning.
Judge is gonna have to admit it.

1183
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:34,160
- Should I be worried?
- I sure would be if I were you.

1184
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:43,711
Honey, where did you read
about all that disclosure shit?

1185
01:29:45,172 --> 01:29:47,965
Let me show you. Why?

1186
01:29:48,175 --> 01:29:51,135
I'm a special automotive instructor
of forensic studies...

1187
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:53,262
for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

1188
01:29:53,346 --> 01:29:55,556
Uh-huh. How long you been
in that position?

1189
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:58,267
Eighteen years.
Your Honor?

1190
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:01,103
May we approach the bench, please?
If you wish.

1191
01:30:08,695 --> 01:30:11,989
I object to this witness
being called at this time.

1192
01:30:12,074 --> 01:30:16,494
We've been given no prior notice
he'd testify, no discovery
of any tests he's conducted...

1193
01:30:16,578 --> 01:30:19,246
or reports he's prepared,
and, as the court is aware,

1194
01:30:19,331 --> 01:30:23,125
the defense is entitled
to advance notice
of any witness who will testify,

1195
01:30:23,210 --> 01:30:26,003
particularly those who will give
scientific evidence...

1196
01:30:26,088 --> 01:30:28,798
so that we could properly prepare
for cross-examination...

1197
01:30:28,882 --> 01:30:32,384
and well as to give the defense
an opportunity to have
the witness' reports reviewed...

1198
01:30:32,469 --> 01:30:35,638
by a defense expert
who might then be in a position...

1199
01:30:35,722 --> 01:30:38,891
to contradict the veracity
of his conclusions.

1200
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:42,311
Mr. Gambini?
Yes, sir?

1201
01:30:42,395 --> 01:30:45,981
That is a lucid, intelligent,
well-thought-out objection.

1202
01:30:46,108 --> 01:30:48,567
Thank you,
Your Honor.
Overruled.

1203
01:30:57,953 --> 01:31:01,872
Now, Mr. Wilbur,

1204
01:31:01,957 --> 01:31:04,291
these are photos of tires...

1205
01:31:04,376 --> 01:31:06,961
belonging to the defendants' car.

1206
01:31:07,045 --> 01:31:09,421
And these are photos of the tire marks...

1207
01:31:09,506 --> 01:31:13,342
left by the assailants' car
as it fled the convenience store.

1208
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:15,678
Now, are you familiar with these?
Yes, I am.

1209
01:31:15,762 --> 01:31:18,514
Uh-huh. Could you, uh,
elaborate please, sir?

1210
01:31:18,598 --> 01:31:22,518
We compared the tire marks
outside the convenience store...

1211
01:31:22,602 --> 01:31:25,813
with the rear tires
of the defendants' car.

1212
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:29,316
They're the same model and size tire.

1213
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:33,320
Michelin model XGV,
size 75-R, 14-inch wheel.

1214
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:38,617
They're the same size
and model tire.
Anything else, sir?

1215
01:31:38,702 --> 01:31:41,871
Yes, indeed.
The car leaving
the convenience store...

1216
01:31:41,955 --> 01:31:44,415
spun its rear tires dramatically...

1217
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:46,834
and left a residue of rubber
on the asphalt.

1218
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:50,004
Now I took a sample of that rubber
and analyzed it.

1219
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:53,090
I also took a sample of the rubber
from the rear tires...

1220
01:31:53,175 --> 01:31:56,010
of the defendants' Buick
and analyzed that too.

1221
01:31:56,094 --> 01:31:59,680
What kind of equipment
did you use to find this out?

1222
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:03,559
I used a Hewlett-Packard 5710-A
dual-column gas chromatograph...

1223
01:32:03,643 --> 01:32:05,728
with flame analyzation detectors.

1224
01:32:05,854 --> 01:32:09,565
Uh-huh.
Is that thing turbocharged?

1225
01:32:09,649 --> 01:32:12,568
Only on the floor models.

1226
01:32:12,652 --> 01:32:16,780
Now, Mr. Wilbur,
what was the result
of your analysis?

1227
01:32:16,865 --> 01:32:21,744
The chemical composition
between the two samples
was found to be identical.

1228
01:32:21,828 --> 01:32:24,622
Identical!

1229
01:32:29,127 --> 01:32:31,212
No further questions, Your Honor.

1230
01:32:32,422 --> 01:32:35,507
Your Honor?
Thank you, Mr. Wilbur.

1231
01:32:36,635 --> 01:32:40,429
The court'll take
a 60-minute recess for lunch.

1232
01:32:40,513 --> 01:32:46,101
Your Honor, I respectfully
request a full day's continuance
to go over all this sh... stuff.

1233
01:32:46,186 --> 01:32:48,896
- Request denied.
- Thanks a lot.

1234
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:51,440
And Mr. Gambini?
Yes, sir?

1235
01:32:51,524 --> 01:32:54,526
I'd like to speak to you
in my chambers.

1236
01:32:55,528 --> 01:32:57,655
- You're a dead man.
- I'm a dead man?

1237
01:32:57,739 --> 01:33:01,825
That's right. I just faxed
the clerk of New York and asked him
what he knew about Jerry Gallo.

1238
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:04,078
You wanna know
what he replied?

1239
01:33:04,204 --> 01:33:06,664
Did you say Jerry "Gallo"?
Yes, I did.

1240
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:08,916
"Gallo" with a "G"?
That's right.

1241
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,252
Jerry Gallo's dead.

1242
01:33:11,336 --> 01:33:13,254
I'm aware of that.

1243
01:33:13,338 --> 01:33:16,757
Well, I'm not Jerry Gallo.
I'm Jerry "Callo."

1244
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:19,551
C-A-L-L-O.

1245
01:33:25,225 --> 01:33:27,226
All right.

1246
01:33:28,395 --> 01:33:30,396
All right.

1247
01:33:35,402 --> 01:33:37,653
Let's get this cleared up
right now.

1248
01:33:46,913 --> 01:33:50,582
Hello. This is Judge Chamberlain Haller.
Can I speak to the clerk?

1249
01:33:52,961 --> 01:33:54,545
Okay, I'll be here.

1250
01:33:56,339 --> 01:33:58,257
He's gonna call back after 3:00.

1251
01:33:59,467 --> 01:34:03,095
That gives you
a stay of execution,

1252
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:08,142
unless by some miracle,
you happen to win this case
in the next 90 minutes.

1253
01:34:10,353 --> 01:34:12,771
Why don't you go to lunch?

1254
01:34:26,953 --> 01:34:29,288
Thanks.

1255
01:34:37,172 --> 01:34:40,883
I got my pictures back.
Oh, good.

1256
01:34:40,967 --> 01:34:43,552
What'd the judge say?

1257
01:34:43,636 --> 01:34:47,639
He said he found out
that Gallo's dead.

1258
01:34:47,766 --> 01:34:49,683
He found out?
Yeah.

1259
01:34:49,768 --> 01:34:51,769
What'd he say?

1260
01:34:51,853 --> 01:34:57,107
Lisa, I'm trying to...
I'm trying to think about
the case now, okay? I'm sorry.

1261
01:34:59,361 --> 01:35:01,904
Can I help?
"Can I help?"

1262
01:35:01,988 --> 01:35:04,490
No, you can't help.
I wish you could, but you can't.

1263
01:35:08,244 --> 01:35:11,538
Look how you're lookin' at me.
Look how you're...
What is that look supposed to mean?

1264
01:35:11,623 --> 01:35:15,209
I'm a piece of shit 'cause I can't
figure out a way for you to help?

1265
01:35:18,671 --> 01:35:21,840
Okay, you're helping.
We'll use your pictures.

1266
01:35:21,925 --> 01:35:25,386
Ah! These are gonna be...
You know, I'm sorry.
These are gonna be a help.

1267
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:27,805
I should have looked
at these pictures before.

1268
01:35:27,889 --> 01:35:31,600
I like this. This is, uh-
This is our first hotel room, right?

1269
01:35:31,684 --> 01:35:34,937
That'll intimidate Trotter.
Here's one of me from behind.

1270
01:35:35,021 --> 01:35:38,232
And I didn't think I could feel worse
than I did a couple of seconds ago.
Thank you.

1271
01:35:38,316 --> 01:35:41,443
Ah, here's a good one
of the tire marks.

1272
01:35:41,528 --> 01:35:43,320
Could we get any farther away?

1273
01:35:43,405 --> 01:35:47,282
Where'd you shoot this from?
Up in a tree? What's this over here?

1274
01:35:47,367 --> 01:35:49,243
What-

1275
01:35:49,327 --> 01:35:51,745
It's dog shit.

1276
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:54,790
Dog shit! That's great!
Dog shit! What a clue!

1277
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:58,252
Why didn't I think of that?
Here's one of me reading. Terrific.

1278
01:35:58,336 --> 01:36:00,587
I should have asked you
a long time ago for these pictures.

1279
01:36:00,672 --> 01:36:04,550
Holy shit. You got it, honey!
You did it!

1280
01:36:04,634 --> 01:36:07,219
The case-cracker:
me in the shower!

1281
01:36:07,303 --> 01:36:10,139
I love this! That's it!

1282
01:36:10,223 --> 01:36:14,351
That is it!
I'm out of here.

1283
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:17,729
Lisa!

1284
01:36:20,233 --> 01:36:21,733
Lisa!

1285
01:36:24,028 --> 01:36:25,571
I'm sorry.

1286
01:36:25,655 --> 01:36:27,156
Fuck!

1287
01:36:42,589 --> 01:36:45,632
I know I'm missing somethin'.
I'm missing somethin'.

1288
01:37:04,152 --> 01:37:06,361
Did you find anything?

1289
01:37:06,446 --> 01:37:08,447
Very, very little.

1290
01:37:09,616 --> 01:37:12,201
Something? Enough to-

1291
01:37:15,163 --> 01:37:18,332
Is it possible
that two separate cars...

1292
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:24,296
could be driving
on Michelin model XGV 75-R14s?

1293
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:26,673
Of course.

1294
01:37:26,758 --> 01:37:30,594
Let me ask you this:
What's the best-selling
single model tire...

1295
01:37:30,678 --> 01:37:33,055
being sold
in the United States today?

1296
01:37:33,139 --> 01:37:35,766
The Michelin XGV.

1297
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:39,770
- And what's the most popular size?
- 75-R14.

1298
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:43,607
The same size
as on the defendants' car.

1299
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:48,153
But two faded green
1964 Buick Skylark convertibles?

1300
01:37:48,238 --> 01:37:51,365
Excuse me.
What I'm asking you...

1301
01:37:51,449 --> 01:37:56,370
is if the most popular size
of the most popular tire...

1302
01:37:56,454 --> 01:37:58,580
is on the defendants' car.

1303
01:37:58,665 --> 01:38:00,874
Well,

1304
01:38:00,959 --> 01:38:02,876
yeah.

1305
01:38:04,212 --> 01:38:07,839
Yes.
Um, thank you.

1306
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:11,218
No further questions.

1307
01:38:13,388 --> 01:38:15,681
The witness can stand down.

1308
01:38:16,683 --> 01:38:18,600
Counsel?

1309
01:38:18,685 --> 01:38:22,604
Uh, Your Honor,
the prosecution rests.

1310
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:29,528
Mr. Gambini, your first witness.

1311
01:38:39,539 --> 01:38:41,540
Mr. Gambini.

1312
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:45,961
I will ask you one more time
and one more time only.

1313
01:38:46,045 --> 01:38:49,006
- If I ask you again...
- Your Honor.

1314
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:52,968
Uh, please, uh, can I have
a five-minute recess?

1315
01:38:53,052 --> 01:38:55,679
My next witness is not
in the courtroom right now.

1316
01:38:55,763 --> 01:38:59,057
Three minutes, no more.

1317
01:39:11,362 --> 01:39:14,489
Sheriff, do me a favor.
Please trace this.

1318
01:39:14,574 --> 01:39:16,491
It's not my job.
You do your own investigating.

1319
01:39:16,576 --> 01:39:19,119
Please. I only have three minutes.

1320
01:39:25,293 --> 01:39:29,546
Lisa. Lisa, please, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, okay?

1321
01:39:29,631 --> 01:39:32,507
I need you to come back
into the courtroom,
and I need the phone.

1322
01:39:32,592 --> 01:39:34,801
Honey, come on now.
Stop it. I need the phone.

1323
01:39:34,886 --> 01:39:37,137
We have to make up.
Listen, let's make up, all right?

1324
01:39:37,221 --> 01:39:39,973
We gotta go back inside.
Everybody's waiting for us.

1325
01:39:40,099 --> 01:39:42,184
Come on.
We don't have a lot of time.
Just shut up.

1326
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:44,686
Gimme this!
Fuck you!

1327
01:39:44,771 --> 01:39:46,813
What is it with you with that mouth?
Shut up!

1328
01:39:46,898 --> 01:39:48,774
Mr. Gambini.

1329
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:51,318
Hey, Sheriff, how are ya?
Tell me why.

1330
01:39:53,071 --> 01:39:56,281
Lisa, I need your help.
I don't give a shit!
Leave me alone!

1331
01:39:56,366 --> 01:39:57,908
Come on. You'll see.
Stop!

1332
01:39:58,034 --> 01:40:00,285
Come on. I found it.
I found it. Come on. You'll see.

1333
01:40:04,332 --> 01:40:09,753
Your Honor, the defense calls
as its first witness
Ms. Mona Lisa Vito.

1334
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:13,507
I-I object, Your Honor.
This person is not
on the witness list.

1335
01:40:13,591 --> 01:40:16,218
This witness is a expert
in the field of automobiles...

1336
01:40:16,302 --> 01:40:19,596
and is being called to rebut
the testimony of George Wilbur.

1337
01:40:21,391 --> 01:40:23,850
- Your Honor, would you please
instruct the bailiff-
- Officer!

1338
01:40:23,935 --> 01:40:26,311
to escort Ms. Vito
to the witness stand please?

1339
01:40:39,826 --> 01:40:42,869
Hold up your right hand.
Do you swear to tell the truth,

1340
01:40:42,995 --> 01:40:46,331
the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?
Yeah.

1341
01:40:51,546 --> 01:40:53,463
Ms. Vito,

1342
01:40:53,548 --> 01:40:58,802
you're supposed to be some
kinda expert in automobiles-
Is that correct?

1343
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:03,807
Is that correct?

1344
01:41:05,852 --> 01:41:07,978
Will you please answer
the counselor's question?

1345
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:09,938
No. I hate him.

1346
01:41:10,022 --> 01:41:13,775
Your Honor, may I have permission
to treat Ms. Vito as a hostile witness?

1347
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:16,111
You think I'm hostile now,
wait till you see me tonight.

1348
01:41:16,195 --> 01:41:18,739
Uh... Do you two know each other?

1349
01:41:18,823 --> 01:41:21,324
Yeah. She's my fiancée.

1350
01:41:21,409 --> 01:41:23,869
Well, that would certainly
explain the hostility.

1351
01:41:23,953 --> 01:41:26,913
Your Honor, I object to this witness.
Improper foundation.

1352
01:41:26,998 --> 01:41:29,207
I'm not aware of
this person's qualifications.

1353
01:41:29,292 --> 01:41:31,960
I'd like to, uh, voir dire...

1354
01:41:32,044 --> 01:41:35,630
this witness as to the extent
of her expertise.

1355
01:41:35,715 --> 01:41:39,718
Granted.
Mr. Trotter, you may proceed.

1356
01:41:39,802 --> 01:41:44,264
Mm-hmm. Uh, Miss Vito,

1357
01:41:44,348 --> 01:41:46,808
what's your current profession?

1358
01:41:46,893 --> 01:41:48,810
I'm an out-of-work hairdresser.

1359
01:41:48,895 --> 01:41:52,647
Out-of-work hairdresser.
Now, in what way does that qualify you...

1360
01:41:52,732 --> 01:41:55,942
as an expert in automobiles?
It doesn't.

1361
01:41:56,027 --> 01:41:57,903
Well, in what way are you qualified?

1362
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:03,325
Well, my father was a mechanic.
His father was a mechanic.

1363
01:42:03,409 --> 01:42:05,535
My mother's father was a mechanic.

1364
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:07,913
My three brothers are mechanics.

1365
01:42:07,997 --> 01:42:10,457
Four uncles on my father's side
are mechanics.

1366
01:42:10,541 --> 01:42:13,084
Miss Vito,
your family's obviously qualified,

1367
01:42:13,169 --> 01:42:16,755
but, uh, have you ever
worked as a mechanic?

1368
01:42:16,839 --> 01:42:20,759
Yeah, in my father's garage, yeah.
As a mechanic?

1369
01:42:23,429 --> 01:42:26,056
What'd you do in your father's garage?

1370
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:31,978
Tune-ups, oil changes,
brake relining, engine rebuilds,

1371
01:42:32,104 --> 01:42:34,481
rebuilt some trannies,
rear ends...
Okay.

1372
01:42:34,565 --> 01:42:37,567
Okay. But does being
an ex-mechanic necessarily...

1373
01:42:37,652 --> 01:42:40,028
qualify you as being
expert on tire marks?

1374
01:42:40,112 --> 01:42:42,405
No. Thank you.

1375
01:42:42,490 --> 01:42:46,117
- Good-bye.
- Sit down and stay there
until you're told to leave.

1376
01:42:49,622 --> 01:42:54,417
Your Honor, Ms. Vito's expertise
is in general automotive knowledge.

1377
01:42:54,502 --> 01:42:58,171
It is in this area
that her testimony will be applicable.

1378
01:42:58,256 --> 01:43:01,633
Now if Mr. Trotter wishes
to voir dire the witness...

1379
01:43:01,717 --> 01:43:04,761
as to the extent of her expertise
in this area,

1380
01:43:04,846 --> 01:43:10,058
I'm sure he's gonna be
more than satisfied.

1381
01:43:10,142 --> 01:43:11,810
Okay.

1382
01:43:13,729 --> 01:43:15,939
All right. All right.

1383
01:43:16,023 --> 01:43:19,109
Now, uh, Miss Vito,

1384
01:43:19,193 --> 01:43:24,698
being an expert on general
automotive knowledge,

1385
01:43:24,782 --> 01:43:27,367
can you tell me...

1386
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:33,164
what would the correct ignition timing be
on a 1955 Bel Air Chevrolet...

1387
01:43:33,249 --> 01:43:38,545
with a 327 cubic inch engine
and a four-barrel carburetor?

1388
01:43:38,671 --> 01:43:42,549
That's a bullshit question.
Does that mean that
you can't answer it?

1389
01:43:42,633 --> 01:43:45,051
It's a bullshit question.
It's impossible to answer.

1390
01:43:45,177 --> 01:43:49,222
Impossible because
you don't know the answer!
Nobody could answer that question.

1391
01:43:49,307 --> 01:43:53,351
Your Honor, I move to disqualify
Miss Vito as a expert witness.

1392
01:43:53,436 --> 01:43:55,562
Can you answer the question?

1393
01:43:55,646 --> 01:43:58,023
No. It is a trick question.

1394
01:43:58,107 --> 01:44:00,483
Why is it a trick question?

1395
01:44:00,568 --> 01:44:02,027
Watch this.

1396
01:44:02,111 --> 01:44:04,613
'Cause Chevy didn't make
a 327 in '55.

1397
01:44:04,697 --> 01:44:06,865
The 327 didn't come out till '62.

1398
01:44:06,949 --> 01:44:10,243
And it wasn't offered in the Bel Air
with the four-barrel carb till '64.

1399
01:44:10,328 --> 01:44:13,079
However, in 1964,

1400
01:44:13,164 --> 01:44:17,000
the correct ignition timing would be
four degrees before top dead center.

1401
01:44:19,587 --> 01:44:20,962
Well,

1402
01:44:21,047 --> 01:44:26,551
um, she's acceptable, Your Honor.

1403
01:44:30,097 --> 01:44:32,057
Your Honor,
this is a picture...

1404
01:44:32,141 --> 01:44:36,144
taken by my fiancée
outside the Sac-O-Suds.

1405
01:44:36,228 --> 01:44:38,229
We agree on this?

1406
01:44:39,398 --> 01:44:41,232
Yeah.
Thank you.

1407
01:44:42,318 --> 01:44:46,488
I'd like to submit this picture
of the tire tracks as evidence.

1408
01:44:46,572 --> 01:44:48,073
Mr. Trotter?

1409
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:52,786
No objection, Your Honor.

1410
01:44:58,876 --> 01:45:01,169
Ms. Vito,
did you take this picture?

1411
01:45:01,295 --> 01:45:04,673
You know I did.
And what is this picture of?

1412
01:45:04,799 --> 01:45:07,092
You know what it's of.
Ms. Vito,

1413
01:45:07,176 --> 01:45:10,136
it has been argued by me,

1414
01:45:10,221 --> 01:45:13,682
the defense,
that two sets of guys met up...

1415
01:45:13,766 --> 01:45:16,101
at the Sac-O-Suds
at the same time...

1416
01:45:16,185 --> 01:45:19,604
driving identical
metallic mint-green...

1417
01:45:19,689 --> 01:45:23,441
1964 Buick Skylark convertibles.

1418
01:45:23,526 --> 01:45:27,445
Now, can you tell us,
by what you see in this picture,

1419
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:30,615
if the defense's case
holds water?

1420
01:45:38,624 --> 01:45:42,127
Ms. Vito, please answer the question.

1421
01:45:42,211 --> 01:45:46,172
Does the defense's case
hold water?

1422
01:45:50,136 --> 01:45:51,302
No.

1423
01:45:52,805 --> 01:45:54,597
The defense is wrong.

1424
01:45:57,977 --> 01:45:59,978
Are you sure?

1425
01:46:00,062 --> 01:46:02,647
I'm positive.

1426
01:46:02,732 --> 01:46:05,150
How could you be so sure?

1427
01:46:06,318 --> 01:46:08,945
Because there is no way
that these tire marks were made...

1428
01:46:09,030 --> 01:46:11,406
by a '64 Buick Skylark.

1429
01:46:11,490 --> 01:46:15,118
These marks were made
by a 1963 Pontiac Tempest.

1430
01:46:15,202 --> 01:46:17,120
Objection, Your Honor.
Can we clarify to the court...

1431
01:46:17,204 --> 01:46:19,122
whether the witness is stating
opinion or fact?

1432
01:46:19,206 --> 01:46:22,751
- This is your opinion?
- It's a fact.

1433
01:46:22,835 --> 01:46:26,963
I find it hard to believe
that this kind of information...

1434
01:46:27,048 --> 01:46:30,592
could be ascertained
simply by looking at a picture.

1435
01:46:30,676 --> 01:46:33,511
Would you like me to explain?

1436
01:46:33,596 --> 01:46:36,973
- I would love to hear this!
- So would I.

1437
01:46:37,058 --> 01:46:42,145
The car that made these two
equal-length tire marks had positraction.

1438
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:44,272
You can't make those marks
without positraction,

1439
01:46:44,356 --> 01:46:49,194
which was not available
on the '64 Buick Skylark.

1440
01:46:49,278 --> 01:46:51,529
And why not?
What is positraction?

1441
01:46:51,614 --> 01:46:55,158
It's a limited slip differential
which distributes power equally...

1442
01:46:55,242 --> 01:46:57,160
to both the right and left tires.

1443
01:46:57,244 --> 01:47:00,747
The '64 Skylark
had a regular differential,

1444
01:47:00,831 --> 01:47:03,500
which anyone
who's been stuck in the mud
in Alabama knows,

1445
01:47:03,584 --> 01:47:06,878
you step on the gas,
one tire spins,
the other tire does nothin'.

1446
01:47:06,962 --> 01:47:08,379
That's right.

1447
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:11,800
Is that it?
No, there's more.

1448
01:47:11,884 --> 01:47:14,511
You see when the left tire mark
goes up on the curb...

1449
01:47:14,595 --> 01:47:16,930
and the right tire mark
stays flat and even?

1450
01:47:17,014 --> 01:47:20,225
Well, the '64 Skylark
had a solid rear axle.

1451
01:47:20,309 --> 01:47:22,936
So when the left tire
would go up on the curb,

1452
01:47:23,020 --> 01:47:25,814
the right tire would tilt out
and ride along its edge.

1453
01:47:25,898 --> 01:47:29,359
But that didn't happen here.
The tire mark stayed flat and even.

1454
01:47:29,443 --> 01:47:32,070
This car had
an independent rear suspension.

1455
01:47:32,154 --> 01:47:37,283
Now, in the '60s, there were only
two other cars made in America...

1456
01:47:37,368 --> 01:47:40,328
that had positraction
and independent rear suspension...

1457
01:47:40,412 --> 01:47:42,413
and enough power
to make these marks.

1458
01:47:42,498 --> 01:47:47,502
One was the Corvette,
which could never be confused
with the Buick Skylark.

1459
01:47:47,586 --> 01:47:52,257
The other had
the same body length,
height, width, weight,

1460
01:47:52,341 --> 01:47:56,010
wheelbase and wheel track
as the '64 Skylark, and that was...

1461
01:47:56,095 --> 01:47:58,763
the 1963 Pontiac Tempest.

1462
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:03,852
And because both cars
were made by G.M.,

1463
01:48:03,936 --> 01:48:06,187
were both cars available...

1464
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:09,065
in metallic mint-green paint?

1465
01:48:09,150 --> 01:48:12,527
- They were.
- Thank you, Ms. Vito.

1466
01:48:12,611 --> 01:48:16,406
No more questions.
Thank you very, very much.

1467
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:21,661
You've been a lovely,
lovely witness.

1468
01:48:32,381 --> 01:48:35,800
Mr. Trotter, would you like
to question Ms. Vito?

1469
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:43,600
- Mr. Trotter?

1470
01:48:43,684 --> 01:48:46,144
Mr. Trotter!

1471
01:48:48,772 --> 01:48:53,902
Uh... Uh, no. No, Your Honor.
No further questions.

1472
01:48:53,986 --> 01:48:58,072
In that case, Your Honor, uh,
I'd like to recall George Wilbur.

1473
01:48:59,950 --> 01:49:03,703
Ms. Vito, you can stand down.

1474
01:49:11,003 --> 01:49:13,796
You realize
you're still under oath?

1475
01:49:13,881 --> 01:49:16,216
Yes, sir.

1476
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:21,512
Uh, Mr. Wilbur,
how'd you like Ms. Vito's testimony?

1477
01:49:21,639 --> 01:49:25,850
Very impressive.
She's cute too, huh?

1478
01:49:25,976 --> 01:49:28,394
Yes, very.

1479
01:49:28,479 --> 01:49:31,231
- Mr. Gambini.
- Sorry. Sorry, Your Honor.

1480
01:49:31,315 --> 01:49:35,693
Uh, Mr. Wilbur,
in your expert opinion,

1481
01:49:35,778 --> 01:49:40,490
would you say that everything
Ms. Vito said on the stand...

1482
01:49:40,574 --> 01:49:43,952
was a hundred percent accurate?

1483
01:49:44,036 --> 01:49:45,954
I'd have to say that.

1484
01:49:46,038 --> 01:49:48,248
And is there
any way in the world...

1485
01:49:48,332 --> 01:49:53,211
the Buick that the defendants
were driving made those tire tracks?

1486
01:49:56,340 --> 01:50:00,134
Come on. You could say.
It's okay. They know.

1487
01:50:01,303 --> 01:50:04,264
Actually... no.

1488
01:50:04,348 --> 01:50:05,974
No. Thank you.

1489
01:50:06,058 --> 01:50:08,726
No more questions.

1490
01:50:11,272 --> 01:50:14,524
Your Honor, I call Sheriff Farley.

1491
01:50:14,650 --> 01:50:18,528
You may stand down now, Mr. Wilbur.

1492
01:50:24,410 --> 01:50:27,537
Sheriff, you realize
you're still under oath?
Yes, sir.

1493
01:50:29,081 --> 01:50:34,711
Uh, Sheriff Farley, um,
what'd you find out?

1494
01:50:34,795 --> 01:50:37,505
On a hunch,

1495
01:50:37,589 --> 01:50:40,425
I took it upon myself to check out
if there was any information...

1496
01:50:40,509 --> 01:50:43,261
on a '63 Pontiac Tempest...

1497
01:50:43,345 --> 01:50:46,389
stolen or abandoned recently.

1498
01:50:46,473 --> 01:50:48,391
This computer readout confirms...

1499
01:50:48,475 --> 01:50:51,019
that two boys who fit
the defendants' description...

1500
01:50:51,103 --> 01:50:56,024
were arrested two days ago
by Sheriff Tilman
in Jasper County, Georgia...

1501
01:50:56,108 --> 01:51:01,446
for driving a stolen metallic mint-green
1963 Pontiac Tempest...

1502
01:51:01,530 --> 01:51:06,242
with a white convertible top,
Michelin model XGV tires,

1503
01:51:06,327 --> 01:51:10,538
size 75-R14.

1504
01:51:10,622 --> 01:51:12,457
Is that it?

1505
01:51:12,541 --> 01:51:13,750
No.

1506
01:51:15,294 --> 01:51:18,379
A .357 magnum revolver
was found in their possession.

1507
01:51:18,464 --> 01:51:21,049
- Sheriff Farley,

1508
01:51:21,133 --> 01:51:23,509
just to refresh the court's memory,

1509
01:51:23,594 --> 01:51:27,638
what caliber bullet was used
to murder Jimmy Willis?

1510
01:51:27,723 --> 01:51:29,182
A .357 magnum.

1511
01:51:29,266 --> 01:51:32,101
The defense rests.

1512
01:51:37,733 --> 01:51:40,651
Mr. Trotter?

1513
01:51:48,494 --> 01:51:51,120
Your Honor,

1514
01:51:51,205 --> 01:51:55,083
in light of Miss Vito's
and Mr. Wilbur's testimony,

1515
01:51:55,167 --> 01:51:57,168
the state would like to dismiss
all charges.

1516
01:51:57,252 --> 01:51:59,420
- Yes!

1517
01:51:59,505 --> 01:52:02,465
All right!

1518
01:52:02,549 --> 01:52:05,885
- Order in the court.

1519
01:52:05,969 --> 01:52:07,470
Yeah!

1520
01:52:17,898 --> 01:52:20,066
Order here!

1521
01:52:33,288 --> 01:52:36,416
I have to get outta here by 3:00.
Make sure all the bags are in the car.
Okay.

1522
01:52:36,542 --> 01:52:38,543
Bring it around.
Vinny.

1523
01:52:38,627 --> 01:52:41,129
I'm sorry to have
ever doubted you at any time.

1524
01:52:41,213 --> 01:52:44,215
And for this, I apologize.
Under the circumstances-

1525
01:52:45,342 --> 01:52:48,094
You were great, and, um,
I just want to say thank you.

1526
01:52:48,178 --> 01:52:50,138
You're welcome.
I hope we can do it
again sometime.

1527
01:52:50,222 --> 01:52:52,682
- Fine job, Mr. Gambini.
- Thanks.

1528
01:52:52,808 --> 01:52:55,059
Y'all come back and see us anytime now.
I'll see ya. I'll see ya.

1529
01:52:55,185 --> 01:52:58,146
Vin.
Bill.

1530
01:53:00,190 --> 01:53:02,400
You're welcome. You're welcome.
Vin, I-

1531
01:53:04,153 --> 01:53:09,699
Bill, listen. Take your time.
Pick the right words.
Get back to New York, give me a call.

1532
01:53:11,827 --> 01:53:13,202
Okay.

1533
01:53:13,328 --> 01:53:16,122
Vinny. You did a terrific job.
Thanks. Thanks.

1534
01:53:16,248 --> 01:53:19,000
I want you to know,
you got an open invitation
anytime you want to come down here.

1535
01:53:19,126 --> 01:53:21,544
Hell, we'll get us a deer next time.
Okay. Thanks a lot.

1536
01:53:21,628 --> 01:53:25,840
I feel like
if I don't get out of here now,
I might never be able to leave.

1537
01:53:25,924 --> 01:53:28,342
Mr. Gambini.

1538
01:53:28,427 --> 01:53:31,762
I have a fax here
from the clerk of New York.

1539
01:53:34,808 --> 01:53:36,809
I owe you an apology, sir.

1540
01:53:36,894 --> 01:53:39,729
I'm honored to shake your hand.

1541
01:53:39,813 --> 01:53:42,356
"Win some, lose some."

1542
01:53:42,441 --> 01:53:45,693
Your courtroom manner
may be rather unconventional,

1543
01:53:45,777 --> 01:53:50,072
but I gotta tell ya-
you're one hell of a trial lawyer.

1544
01:53:50,157 --> 01:53:53,034
Thank you.
And you're one hell of a judge.

1545
01:53:53,118 --> 01:53:55,119
Ooh, sorry.

1546
01:53:57,789 --> 01:54:00,666
Bye now.
Bye!

1547
01:54:07,925 --> 01:54:11,427
What the hell
was that all about back there?

1548
01:54:11,512 --> 01:54:13,763
I had a friend
send a fax to the judge...

1549
01:54:13,847 --> 01:54:16,974
confirming the very impressive
legal stature...

1550
01:54:17,059 --> 01:54:20,394
of Jerry Callo.

1551
01:54:20,479 --> 01:54:23,105
What friends you got
in the clerk's office?

1552
01:54:23,232 --> 01:54:26,400
Your friend.
My friend?

1553
01:54:26,485 --> 01:54:28,569
Judge Malloy?

1554
01:54:30,822 --> 01:54:34,242
So, what's your problem?
My problem is...

1555
01:54:34,326 --> 01:54:38,120
I wanted to win my first case
without any help from anybody.

1556
01:54:38,247 --> 01:54:41,624
Well, I guess
that plan's moot.
Yeah.

1557
01:54:43,210 --> 01:54:45,586
You know, this could be
a sign of things to come.

1558
01:54:45,671 --> 01:54:49,632
You win all your cases,
but with somebody else's help, right?

1559
01:54:49,716 --> 01:54:54,011
You win case after case,
and then afterwards you have
to go up to somebody...

1560
01:54:54,096 --> 01:54:56,180
and you have to say "Thank you."

1561
01:54:57,266 --> 01:55:01,519
Oh, my God,
what a fuckin' nightmare!

1562
01:55:07,067 --> 01:55:09,777
I won my first case.
You know what this means.

1563
01:55:09,861 --> 01:55:11,654
Yeah, you think
I'm gonna marry you.

1564
01:55:13,073 --> 01:55:16,158
What, you're not
gonna marry me now?
No way.

1565
01:55:16,243 --> 01:55:18,995
Can't win a case by yourself.
You're fuckin' useless.

1566
01:55:21,456 --> 01:55:23,374
I thought we'd get married
this weekend.

1567
01:55:23,458 --> 01:55:27,211
You don't get it, do you?
That is not romantic.

1568
01:55:27,296 --> 01:55:31,048
I want a wedding in church
with bridesmaids and flowers.

1569
01:55:31,133 --> 01:55:35,469
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
How many times did you say
that spontaneous is romantic?

1570
01:55:35,554 --> 01:55:39,181
Hey, a burp is spontaneous.
A burp is not romantic.

1571
01:55:39,391 --> 01:55:41,475

you anyway?
