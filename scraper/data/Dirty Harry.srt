2
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,342
Jesus!

3
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,886
"To the city of San Francisco.

4
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,473
I will enjoy killing
one person every day...

5
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:52,810
...until you pay me
one hundred thousand dollars.

6
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,188
If you agree,
say so tomorrow morning...

7
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,442
<i>...at personal column,
San Francisco Chronicle...</i>

8
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,527
...and I will set up meeting.

9
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:03,404
If I do not hear from you...

10
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:07,283
...it'll be my next pleasure
to kill a Catholic priest or a..."

11
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,245
"Scorpio."

12
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,167
What goes on in their minds?

13
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:17,668
Kooks.

14
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,839
Where the hell does he expect me to
find a hundred thousand dollars?

15
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:25,551
You're not thinking of paying him,
are you, Mr. Mayor?

16
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:30,681
The City of San Francisco does not
pay criminals not to commit crimes.

17
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,809
Instead, we pay a police department.

18
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,229
Chief, who's in charge of this case?

19
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,274
Inspector Callahan.
He's outside.

20
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,822
Send Inspector Callahan in.

21
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,410
Callahan?

22
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,997
Mr. Mayor, Inspector Callahan.

23
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:56,374
All right.

24
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:57,750
Let's have it.

25
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,338
- Have what?
- Your report. What have you been doing?

26
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:04,215
For the past 3/4 hour...

27
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:07,385
...I've been sitting on my ass
waiting on you.

28
00:07:08,552 --> 00:07:11,514
Damn it, Harry.
It's the mayor you're talking to.

29
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:17,311
Won't you sit down, Inspector Callahan?

30
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:29,573
There's a madman loose.

31
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:33,077
I've asked you what's being done.
Fair enough?

32
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:39,375
We've got a dozen men
checking identification files.

33
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,212
Checking on all known extortionists,
rooftop prowlers...

34
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:44,630
...rifle nuts, peepers...

35
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,507
Mr. Mayor?

36
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,802
We've arranged for rooftop
surveillance and helicopters...

37
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,597
...especially around
the Catholic churches and schools...

38
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:55,433
...and in the black area.

39
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,977
Ballistics is checking on the slug.

40
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,603
We're sure it's a 30-06.

41
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,732
Seven lands and grooves,
right-hand twist...

42
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,608
We're running a computer check...

43
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:08,696
...on everybody in the files
whose birthday falls between...

44
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,489
...October 23 and November 21.

45
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,741
Why?

46
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,784
Natives of Scorpio.

47
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,996
Thank you, inspector.

48
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,583
Have you mentioned this note to anyone?

49
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,628
How about you?

50
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,088
Nobody.

51
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,174
Your wife, sweetheart?
Press?

52
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,675
Nobody.

53
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,973
<i>All right. Give the message
to the Chronicle.</i>

54
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,477
We'll pay. But we need time
to get the money together.

55
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,687
Wait a minute. Do I get this right?

56
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,689
You'll play this creep's game?

57
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,733
It'll give us breathing space.

58
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,069
It might get somebody killed.

59
00:08:49,236 --> 00:08:50,821
Let me meet with the son of a bitch!

60
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:54,784
Nope, none of that.
We would end up with a real bloodbath.

61
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,828
I agree with the chief.
We'll do it this way.

62
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,915
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
Come on, Callahan, let's go.

63
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:11,342
I don't want trouble, like you had
last year in the Fillmore district.

64
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,594
That's my policy.

65
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:17,098
When an adult male
is chasing a female...

66
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,686
...with intent to commit rape,
I shoot the bastard. That's my policy.

67
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,562
Intent?

68
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,439
How did you establish that?

69
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:32,154
When a naked man chases a woman in
an alley with a knife and a hard-on...

70
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,866
...I figure he isn't out
collecting for the Red Cross.

71
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,580
I think he's got a point.

72
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,472
- Inspector Callahan.
- Jaffe.

73
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,223
Usual.

74
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,477
Usual lunch, or usual dinner?

75
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,228
What difference does it make?

76
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,481
Not much.

77
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,443
Hey, Jaffe...

78
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,447
...is that tan Ford still
in front of the bank?

79
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,784
Tan Ford?

80
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:04,914
Yeah, tan Ford.

81
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,957
Engine running?

82
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,002
I don't know.
How can I tell?

83
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,798
- Exhaust fumes out of the tailpipe.
- That's awful!

84
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,050
Look at that pollution.

85
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,140
Do me a favor, will you?

86
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,185
Call this telephone number.

87
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,187
Police Department?

88
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:31,190
Tell them Inspector Callahan
thinks there's a...

89
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,735
...two-eleven in progress
at the bank. Got it?

90
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:37,571
Got it.

91
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:41,075
Be sure and tell them
it's in progress, right?

92
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:44,120
In progress.
Yes, sir.

93
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:53,295
Now, if they'll just wait
till the cavalry arrives.

94
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,508
Shit!

95
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,481
Halt!

96
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,360
I know what you're thinking.

97
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,947
Did he fire six shots or only five?

98
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:47,326
To tell the truth, in the excitement
I kind of lost track myself.

99
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,830
This is a.44 Magnum, the most
powerful handgun in the world...

100
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,374
...and would blow
your head clean off...

101
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:57,878
...you've got to ask yourself
one question: "Do I feel lucky?"

102
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,755
Well, do you, punk?

103
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,696
I got to know.

104
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,716
Son of a bitch!

105
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,139
It looks like we can save that leg.

106
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,266
I've got a couple under my knee.

107
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,268
Ever consider
another line of work?

108
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,979
I really appreciate this, Steve.

109
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,690
We Potrero Hill boys
have to stick together.

110
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,567
Nothing fancy, now.

111
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:05,404
Just a little tweezers
and Mercurochrome.

112
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,616
Do I tell you how to beat a confession
out of a prisoner?

113
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:13,204
- I haven't got all night.
- You might experience discomfort.

114
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,083
But if you do,
just have your wife fix a...

115
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,418
Sorry, Harry.

116
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,380
- What will you do with those?
- Cut your pants off.

117
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,883
- No. We'll pull them off.
- It'll hurt.

118
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,636
For $29.50, let it hurt.

119
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,430
You can turn your back
if you're embarrassed.

120
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,515
- Good morning, inspector.
- Maria.

121
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,899
You wanted to see me, lieutenant?

122
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,238
When the hell
you going to get a haircut?

123
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,366
Whenever you do.

124
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:17,703
Who's got time? I was up till 3 a.m.
Checking the search patterns.

125
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:21,248
- Put in for overtime.
- That'll be the day.

126
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,709
You made a good pinch.
Chief was pleased.

127
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,046
- He was?
- He said to say, "Well done!"

128
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,340
I can't tell you how moved I am.

129
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,634
I pass along a compliment...

130
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,763
...you could be a little polite.
It might not kill you to say thanks.

131
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,973
I'd rather say thanks to a raise.

132
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:42,520
Harry, check communications.
Something from Chicago. A gun nut.

133
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,731
- I'll get right on it.
- Now wait a minute!

134
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,441
I'm putting somebody
with you.

135
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:56,242
- What are you talking about?
- You need a partner.

136
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,037
- What's wrong with the one I've got?
- He's in the hospital!

137
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:03,874
- He'll be out in a few weeks.
- Say hello to Chico Gonzales.

138
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,752
- He'll be working with you.
- You must be kidding.

139
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,130
I have no time to break in newcomers.

140
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,591
- Why don't you do this boy a favor?
- What do you mean?

141
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:17,013
You know what happens to guys I worked
with. Deitzick's in the hospital...

142
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,597
...and Fanduchi's dead.

143
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,057
So?

144
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,895
If I need a partner, I'll get me one
who knows what he's doing.

145
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,355
What about De Georgio?

146
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,898
No way!

147
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,317
You work with Gonzales
or you don't work.

148
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,611
Straight from the fifth floor.
Got it?

149
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:36,782
I got it.

150
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,956
If you see De Georgio,
send him in here!

151
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,959
You from around here?

152
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,337
Yeah, but I went to San Jose State.

153
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:53,049
- Play ball?
- No, I boxed. Light heavyweight.

154
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,218
Just what I need is a college boy.

155
00:18:56,469 --> 00:19:00,389
- Found anything you like about me yet?
- It's early yet.

156
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,808
- Get your degree?
- Sociology.

157
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,645
Sociology! You'll go far, if you live.

158
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,064
I intend to.

159
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,483
Inspector Callahan.

160
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:14,445
Don't let your degree get you killed.
I'm liable to get killed with you.

161
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,946
I'll remember that.

162
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:21,160
- Hero! Nice work yesterday.
- Fatso! Bressler wants to see you.

163
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,330
You're a sweet man, Harry.

164
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,921
There is one question,
Inspector Callahan.

165
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,298
Why do they call you Dirty Harry?

166
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,384
That's one thing about our Harry.

167
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:37,885
Doesn't play favorites.

168
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:42,682
Harry hates everybody: Limeys, micks,
hebes, dagos, niggers, honkies, chinks.

169
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,433
You name it.

170
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:48,646
- How does he feel about Mexicans?
- Ask him!

171
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,399
Especially spics.

172
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,324
Hey! There's a guy
on the roof over there!

173
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,492
On Stockton Street
by Washington Square.

174
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:13,976
<i>You, on the roof!</i>

175
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,020
<i>You, there!</i>

176
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,980
<i>Yes, you.
Stop what you're doing.</i>

177
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,983
<i>Turn around
and put your hands in the air.</i>

178
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:41,545
<i>I don 't know
how the helicopter boys lost him!</i>

179
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:44,757
How could they let him get out
without seeing him?

180
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:48,803
They were probably talking instead of
looking, like they were supposed to.

181
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:50,721
That's possible.

182
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:01,440
<i>- Attention, all units.
- Turn that thing up louder.</i>

183
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:06,404
<i>Prowler last seen
in the vicinity of Washington Square.</i>

184
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:07,780
<i>He is an adult male.</i>

185
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,701
<i>Caucasian. Repeat,
adult male Caucasian.</i>

186
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,245
<i>When last seen,
he was wearing tan chinos...</i>

187
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:18,290
<i>... pale blue shirt, brown coat
or sweater, dark gloves.</i>

188
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,917
<i>He had a tan suitcase...</i>

189
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:24,422
<i>... which probably contains a
30-06 rifle. He's wanted...</i>

190
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:28,092
Those loonies! They ought to throw
a net over the whole bunch!

191
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:30,219
I know what you mean.

192
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,266
- There!
- What?

193
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,184
Tan suitcase.

194
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,812
- Where?
- I lost him.

195
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,524
There he goes, over there.

196
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,109
Does that bag look tan?

197
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,611
I don't know,
I haven't even seen him yet.

198
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,572
Go to Filbert and hang a left.

199
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,407
Look out for these people!

200
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:54,785
- Fruitcake!
- Get out of the way, hammerhead!

201
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:02,251
It was a tan suitcase.
I know it was.

202
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,755
I saw him.

203
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,631
- There he is.
- I see him.

204
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,261
<i>Car 2, the license number...</i>

205
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,348
<i>... at 10-32 on that Chevrolet,
Colorado plates.</i>

206
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:24,565
- How do you want to work this?
- Find another entrance. I'll go here.

207
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:27,777
<i>Car 2, what's the model
of that Chevrolet?</i>

208
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:33,491
<i>Car 2. It's an Impala convertible.</i>

209
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,368
<i>10-4.</i>

210
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,591
<i>You can cancel that 10-25.
Three cars here.</i>

211
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,282
Anybody home?

212
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,560
- I brought you a nice present.
- Let me see it.

213
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:02,997
It's beautiful! Why don't you go get
a nice container of egg rolls?

214
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:10,046
You getting an eyeful?

215
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:12,506
You goddamn pie hawker!

216
00:27:12,757 --> 00:27:15,134
- We should call the police.
- I am a police...

217
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,770
Up against the wall.
Right now! Move.

218
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:32,651
- Let them go.
- Let them go?

219
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,571
- You heard me.
- They assaulted a police officer.

220
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,949
A police officer!
He was standing on a can peeking in...

221
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,118
...on Hot Mary and her boyfriend!

222
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:42,828
Beat it. Get out of here.

223
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:50,711
- How about the man with the suitcase?
- Wrong number.

224
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:53,881
I just had another thought.

225
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,591
Yeah? About what?

226
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,302
About why
they call you Dirty Harry.

227
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:06,852
<i>Inspector 71.</i>

228
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:12,525
<i>Inspector 71.
Please respond to your call.</i>

229
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,945
<i>Inspector 71.
Do you read me?</i>

230
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:20,074
<i>- This is Inspector 71.
- I've got an 8-0-4 in progress.</i>

231
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,994
<i>California Hall
at Polk and Turk streets.</i>

232
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:25,037
10-4. We're on our way.

233
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,393
It's some idiot.

234
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:49,729
Where? I don't see him.

235
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:52,690
- There he is.
- Yeah. Now I see him.

236
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:58,362
<i>I have a 10-29 and a 10-28.</i>

237
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:01,866
<i>In 600 block of Baker.
On a Chevrolet.</i>

238
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:06,912
<i>California license D-dog,
C- Charles, V-Victor 4-7-2.</i>

239
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:19,550
We thought it was your sniper, but
it turned out to be a suicide attempt.

240
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:37,401
- Anybody try to talk him down?
- Yeah, no luck. But now you're here...

241
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:40,446
- You mean, I go up.
- We'd sure appreciate it.

242
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:54,770
Don't you try to get me!

243
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:59,650
Not me. You're the one who
wants to get yourself killed. Not me.

244
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:03,988
Always happens with you guys.
The last minute you want to...

245
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:09,243
...grab onto somebody, take somebody
with you. Down you go. Not me!

246
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:11,495
Won't you try to grab me?

247
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:17,626
A friend of mine was up about 20
floors with a jumper a few years ago.

248
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:20,046
The jumper grabbed him
and they went off.

249
00:31:20,338 --> 00:31:21,380
Mashed all over.

250
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:25,843
Couldn't tell which legs was
with which, which arms with which...

251
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:29,388
It was a terrible mess.
I tell you, I almost threw up myself.

252
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:33,225
- I'd just like your name and address.
- Why?

253
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:37,730
It's a mess down there afterwards!
It makes identification impossible.

254
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,107
Even if they find
your driver's license!

255
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:41,734
All that blood!

256
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,615
I think I'm going to puke!

257
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:51,494
Don't do that, son. All those people
down there looking up.

258
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:54,664
The fire chief looking up.
With his face...

259
00:31:55,373 --> 00:31:56,540
You bastard!

260
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:46,048
Get the stretcher up here.

261
00:32:58,436 --> 00:33:01,105
Now you know why I'm called
Dirty Harry.

262
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,774
Every dirty job that comes along.

263
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:18,622
<i>Inspector 71.</i>

264
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:22,126
This is Inspector 71.

265
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:26,964
<i>Got something for you. Corner of
Sierra and Texas. A young boy, Negro.</i>

266
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:30,343
What about him?

267
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:33,346
Shot in the face.
Blew part of it away.

268
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:37,350
Anybody know who the boy is?

269
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,727
His name was Charlie Russell.

270
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:41,562
I'm his mother.

271
00:33:42,313 --> 00:33:45,358
He's only 10 years old.

272
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:01,874
Inspector, this officer...
Oh, Jesus Christ!

273
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:04,293
You'd better go check on the mother.

274
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:17,932
What do you have?

275
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:21,227
<i>That 30-06 shell casing.</i>

276
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:23,270
<i>He was up here all right.</i>

277
00:34:27,942 --> 00:34:29,527
Welcome to Homicide.

278
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:53,050
The man who designed blue serge
uniforms for police departments...

279
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:55,553
...has to sell these for a living!

280
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:02,435
.458 Magnum?

281
00:35:04,437 --> 00:35:07,440
- This thing will stop an elephant.
- Yeah.

282
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:12,361
- Apparently you like a little edge.
- All I can get, sir.

283
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:15,781
He's no elephant, Harry.
He's no animal of any kind.

284
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:17,658
What have you got, lieutenant?

285
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:22,288
The blue flags represent the units that
will be on duty by dark tonight.

286
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:24,790
- Double shifts and overtime.
- At nighttime.

287
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:27,835
Daylight, the helicopters
will keep him off the roofs.

288
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:32,173
We're going for high visibility. Units
will make themselves very noticeable.

289
00:35:32,423 --> 00:35:34,967
- Except here.
- Right. The North Beach area.

290
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:36,886
We're saving that for him.

291
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:39,680
- Have you found a good stakeout?
- I think so.

292
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:44,060
It's a building that overlooks the
roof where they spotted him yesterday.

293
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:46,312
Something bothering you?

294
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:50,441
- Nothing.
- Speak up. You're among friends here.

295
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:53,778
It seems a long shot
that he'd come back to the same roof.

296
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:57,198
There are a lot of rooftops
in San Francisco.

297
00:35:57,406 --> 00:36:00,910
Most of them are locked.
This particular one'll be open for him.

298
00:36:01,786 --> 00:36:05,039
These sick guys have behavior patterns.

299
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:09,126
We know they'll rob the very
same store 3, 4 times in a row.

300
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:11,921
Must appeal to their
superego or something.

301
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:14,507
Scorpio strikes again.

302
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:17,134
They like that feeling.

303
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:20,971
There's one other reason
why he might pick the same rooftop.

304
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:24,266
He's got a clear view
of the St. Peter and Paul's Church.

305
00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:26,644
And they're having a novena tonight.

306
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:28,437
Go on.

307
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:32,024
The note. He threatened
to kill a priest or a Negro.

308
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:33,901
The Russell boy was black.

309
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:37,905
<i>He may just figure
he owes himself a padre.</i>

310
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:55,172
Inspector 71.

311
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:58,843
We're in position
to start our surveillance.

312
00:37:22,742 --> 00:37:23,951
How about the priest?

313
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,496
- He knows he's being set up for bait?
- Yeah, he wanted to.

314
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:31,709
We told him we had a volunteer
willing to take his place.

315
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:33,461
Who?

316
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:36,422
Never guess.

317
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:40,092
Yeah, I know.
Welcome to Homicide.

318
00:39:11,225 --> 00:39:14,729
You owe it to yourself
to live a little, Harry.

319
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:31,329
Son of a bitch took the bait!

320
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:35,624
When I say "now,"
hit him with the light.

321
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:18,501
Now!

322
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:01,293
- You all right?
- I think so.

323
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,725
Call an ambulance.

324
00:41:59,143 --> 00:42:01,020
Collins never knew what hit him.

325
00:42:05,566 --> 00:42:08,653
Let's go. Clear the alley.
There's nothing to see.

326
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:11,155
Call headquarters.
He's loose in North Beach.

327
00:42:58,327 --> 00:43:00,454
It's a whole new ball game, fellows.

328
00:43:01,372 --> 00:43:03,874
He grabbed a 14-year-old girl.

329
00:43:05,543 --> 00:43:06,669
Ann Mary Deacon.

330
00:43:06,961 --> 00:43:10,589
The bomb squad got a call.
Suspicious object in Golden Gate Park.

331
00:43:10,798 --> 00:43:15,469
It was addressed to the mayor. The lab
sent it to us, with this letter inside.

332
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,513
"Ann Mary Deacon, buried alive."

333
00:43:17,763 --> 00:43:21,183
The poor kid went to the movies
last night and never came home.

334
00:43:22,184 --> 00:43:25,312
"Double-crossing San Francisco police
made me do this.

335
00:43:25,563 --> 00:43:29,275
Now ransom $200,000,
in used tens and twenties.

336
00:43:29,859 --> 00:43:31,319
One man with yellow bag.

337
00:43:31,569 --> 00:43:34,405
South side Marina.
Green East Harbor.

338
00:43:34,655 --> 00:43:36,073
9 p.m.

339
00:43:36,365 --> 00:43:38,492
She has oxygen
till 3 a.m. Tomorrow.

340
00:43:38,743 --> 00:43:41,329
Red panties and bra. Nice tits.

341
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:45,374
Mole on left thigh. Anything cute
and you'll force me to let girl die...

342
00:43:45,624 --> 00:43:48,252
...of slow suffocation.
Signed, Scorpio."

343
00:43:50,796 --> 00:43:51,797
Anything else?

344
00:43:53,549 --> 00:43:55,885
The mother identified the bra...

345
00:43:56,135 --> 00:43:57,762
...the hank of hair...

346
00:43:58,137 --> 00:43:59,305
...and that.

347
00:43:59,555 --> 00:44:01,182
The dentist identified that.

348
00:44:03,184 --> 00:44:05,561
Said it was pulled out
with a pair of pliers.

349
00:44:07,688 --> 00:44:08,773
You know she's dead.

350
00:44:09,065 --> 00:44:13,444
All I know is the letter says
she'll be alive until 3 a.m.

351
00:44:14,654 --> 00:44:18,199
The mayor's out trying to
put the money together now.

352
00:44:19,075 --> 00:44:20,660
He's using up a lot of favors.

353
00:44:22,828 --> 00:44:24,413
He wants to pay.

354
00:44:26,123 --> 00:44:27,667
No tricks.

355
00:44:33,756 --> 00:44:35,716
We need a bag man.
You want the job?

356
00:44:37,927 --> 00:44:38,844
You got it.

357
00:44:39,095 --> 00:44:42,181
- Be in the chief's office at 6 p.m.
- All right.

358
00:44:42,431 --> 00:44:45,059
- Wait a minute. What about me?
- You're out.

359
00:44:45,309 --> 00:44:47,061
No cover?
Not even one man?

360
00:44:49,397 --> 00:44:50,815
Sure that's how to do it?

361
00:44:51,023 --> 00:44:53,985
I'm not sure!
But those are my orders. All right?

362
00:44:56,028 --> 00:45:00,366
No wonder they call him Dirty Harry.
He gets the shit end of the stick.

363
00:45:00,616 --> 00:45:03,411
One more word and you're
chopped off at the ankles.

364
00:45:04,286 --> 00:45:07,373
Al, let's split the difference.
Give him the night off.

365
00:45:08,332 --> 00:45:10,501
Get the hell out of here,
both of you.

366
00:45:21,887 --> 00:45:24,015
Testing 1, 2, 3...

367
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:27,685
- What are you yelling for?
- All you have to do is whisper.

368
00:45:28,144 --> 00:45:30,896
"Mary had a little lamb,
its fleece as white as snow."

369
00:45:31,105 --> 00:45:32,732
Okay, that's better.

370
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,901
It's good for 2 or 3 blocks.
But in a tunnel...

371
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:37,528
...forget it.

372
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,947
All right, Sid.
What do I owe you?

373
00:45:40,197 --> 00:45:42,325
Bring it back in one piece.

374
00:45:46,537 --> 00:45:48,289
$200,000.

375
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:50,499
Count it and sign for it.

376
00:45:53,127 --> 00:45:55,087
Did you count it out?

377
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:59,425
Did you count it, chief?

378
00:46:01,135 --> 00:46:03,429
It's not my responsibility.

379
00:46:05,598 --> 00:46:09,101
Always knew I'd get rich
on the police force.

380
00:46:11,687 --> 00:46:15,107
Just make sure
nobody takes it away from you.

381
00:46:18,277 --> 00:46:22,198
God knows how he'll contact you.
He'll probably run you all over town.

382
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:24,867
Go where you're told.
Do what you're told.

383
00:46:25,159 --> 00:46:28,245
Play it straight down the line. Okay?

384
00:46:37,296 --> 00:46:39,548
Nothing cute.
Nothing fancy.

385
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,135
Just pay the ransom money
and report back here.

386
00:46:46,013 --> 00:46:48,891
Would you mind if I borrowed
a little Scotch tape?

387
00:46:59,568 --> 00:47:03,406
It's disgusting that a police officer
should know how to use that weapon.

388
00:48:08,012 --> 00:48:11,766
<i>- You got a yellow suitcase?
- Yeah, I got it right with me.</i>

389
00:48:15,102 --> 00:48:17,313
<i>- What's your name?
- Callahan.</i>

390
00:48:17,605 --> 00:48:20,232
<i>- What are you?
- Police officer.</i>

391
00:48:21,776 --> 00:48:23,194
Hello?

392
00:48:33,913 --> 00:48:35,915
<i>All right, police officer...</i>

393
00:48:36,165 --> 00:48:38,000
<i>... this is how we play.</i>

394
00:48:39,168 --> 00:48:42,421
<i>I bounce you all over town
to make sure you're alone.</i>

395
00:48:42,963 --> 00:48:46,050
<i>If I even think you're being followed,
the girl dies.</i>

396
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:50,429
<i>If you talk to anyone, even if it's
a Pekinese pissing on a lamppost...</i>

397
00:48:50,763 --> 00:48:52,181
<i>... the girl dies.</i>

398
00:48:52,431 --> 00:48:55,518
<i>- Is the girl okay?
- Just shut up and listen.</i>

399
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:57,103
<i>No car.</i>

400
00:48:57,603 --> 00:49:01,273
<i>I give you some time
to go from phone booth to phone booth.</i>

401
00:49:01,482 --> 00:49:05,069
<i>I ring 4 times.
You don 't answer by the fourth ring...</i>

402
00:49:05,361 --> 00:49:07,363
<i>... that's the end of the game.</i>

403
00:49:07,863 --> 00:49:09,407
<i>The girl dies.</i>

404
00:49:09,657 --> 00:49:11,534
<i>What time you got?</i>

405
00:49:12,535 --> 00:49:15,830
<i>- 9:30. Now listen...
- You listen.</i>

406
00:49:16,539 --> 00:49:18,124
<i>I'm watching you.</i>

407
00:49:18,749 --> 00:49:22,336
<i>Not all the time,
but you'll never know when or where.</i>

408
00:49:23,462 --> 00:49:27,842
<i>Now get to Forest Hills Station
as fast as you can. Understand?</i>

409
00:49:33,723 --> 00:49:36,600
<i>- Yeah.
- I hope you're not stupid.</i>

410
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,518
<i>Downstairs.
Take the "K" car.</i>

411
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:23,522
<i>Get off at Church and 20th.
Hurry up, or you'll blow it.</i>

412
00:52:29,357 --> 00:52:31,233
<i>You sound like you had a good rest.</i>

413
00:52:31,484 --> 00:52:35,279
<i>You'll need it. I'm going to give you
a nice little run this time.</i>

414
00:52:35,488 --> 00:52:38,908
<i>You better make it,
because if you don 't, dead girl!</i>

415
00:52:39,158 --> 00:52:42,370
<i>Public phone,
hamburger stand, Aquatic Park.</i>

416
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:47,708
<i>Hubba-hubba-hubba, pig bastard.</i>

417
00:53:21,409 --> 00:53:23,244
What's in the bag, man?

418
00:53:24,412 --> 00:53:27,665
- You dudes get lost now, you hear?
- Screw the bag!

419
00:53:27,957 --> 00:53:29,333
Just give us the wallet.

420
00:53:32,962 --> 00:53:34,839
You don't listen, do you, asshole?

421
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,660
Don't answer that!

422
00:54:13,794 --> 00:54:18,257
<i>- Who picked it up?
- Some old guy. Never saw him before.</i>

423
00:54:22,928 --> 00:54:24,805
<i>Chico, he hung up.</i>

424
00:54:27,308 --> 00:54:29,602
<i>- You know Mt. Davidson Park?
- Yeah.</i>

425
00:54:29,852 --> 00:54:31,103
<i>Go to the cross.</i>

426
00:55:10,226 --> 00:55:12,520
I'm at the entrance
on Lansdale Street.

427
00:55:13,521 --> 00:55:15,564
<i>I'm going up.</i>

428
00:55:29,954 --> 00:55:31,998
I see a couple of people.

429
00:55:35,376 --> 00:55:37,169
Just a couple of kids necking.

430
00:55:37,461 --> 00:55:39,880
Boys or girls?

431
00:55:58,441 --> 00:56:00,609
I'm Callahan.

432
00:56:02,862 --> 00:56:04,655
My friends call me Alice.

433
00:56:05,281 --> 00:56:06,699
And I will take a dare.

434
00:56:08,034 --> 00:56:10,911
When was the last time
you were busted?

435
00:56:11,412 --> 00:56:14,498
If you're a vice, I'll kill myself.

436
00:56:14,999 --> 00:56:16,375
Well, do it at home.

437
00:57:20,022 --> 00:57:21,107
Freeze!

438
00:57:22,149 --> 00:57:23,943
Just like a statue.

439
00:57:24,944 --> 00:57:26,445
That's right.

440
00:57:27,154 --> 00:57:30,074
One wrong move,
anything, I don't care.

441
00:57:30,366 --> 00:57:33,035
I'll kill you and the girl both.

442
00:57:33,703 --> 00:57:35,079
Understand?

443
00:57:36,622 --> 00:57:37,790
Yeah.

444
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,668
Drop the bag.

445
00:57:44,296 --> 00:57:45,631
Left hand.

446
00:57:46,173 --> 00:57:47,800
Let's see the gun.

447
00:57:53,389 --> 00:57:54,557
My!

448
00:57:55,016 --> 00:57:56,642
That's a big one.

449
00:57:58,185 --> 00:58:00,146
Left hand. Throw it.

450
00:58:01,439 --> 00:58:02,690
Easy.

451
00:58:07,069 --> 00:58:08,404
Raise your hands.

452
00:58:08,654 --> 00:58:10,406
Come on, get them up.

453
00:58:14,243 --> 00:58:15,453
Now turn.

454
00:58:15,703 --> 00:58:17,496
Face the cross.

455
00:58:20,082 --> 00:58:21,208
Come on.

456
00:58:21,459 --> 00:58:24,253
Put your nose right up
against the cement.

457
00:58:46,192 --> 00:58:50,363
You lift that hand once more and I
won't let you know where the girl is!

458
00:58:50,738 --> 00:58:52,573
Do we understand each other?

459
00:58:53,574 --> 00:58:54,909
Do we understand each other?

460
00:58:56,243 --> 00:58:58,329
Don't pass out on me yet!
No, no.

461
00:58:58,579 --> 00:59:00,206
No, no. Not yet. Not yet!

462
00:59:00,456 --> 00:59:02,625
Don't pass out on me yet,
you rotten oinker!

463
00:59:03,751 --> 00:59:06,212
Do we understand each other?

464
00:59:06,962 --> 00:59:11,634
If you care what happens to the girl,
you'd better answer me! All right?

465
00:59:11,884 --> 00:59:13,052
Listen to me carefully.

466
00:59:14,178 --> 00:59:15,888
I've changed my mind.

467
00:59:16,472 --> 00:59:18,099
I'm going to let her die.

468
00:59:20,101 --> 00:59:22,353
I just wanted you to know that.

469
00:59:26,732 --> 00:59:31,278
<i>You understand? I just wanted to make
sure you knew that before I killed you.</i>

470
00:59:40,705 --> 00:59:42,248
Goodbye, Callahan!

471
00:59:51,674 --> 00:59:53,467
Chico, don't kill him!

472
01:01:48,499 --> 01:01:51,836
The hospital report on Gonzales
looks okay, chief.

473
01:01:52,169 --> 01:01:54,505
Yeah. Well, he's a pretty tough kid.

474
01:01:55,047 --> 01:01:56,382
He's right here.

475
01:01:56,632 --> 01:01:58,217
He's got two cracked ribs.

476
01:01:58,467 --> 01:02:01,262
They want to do some more tests
on him in the morning.

477
01:02:01,512 --> 01:02:04,682
The son of a bitch really
kicked him a couple of beauts.

478
01:02:04,932 --> 01:02:06,142
I'm sending him home.

479
01:02:06,434 --> 01:02:07,768
Right, chief.

480
01:02:08,894 --> 01:02:10,646
He says beat it! That's an order.

481
01:02:12,815 --> 01:02:16,319
The chief wants to know
if I misunderstood his orders.

482
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:20,197
Meaning, am I just plain stupid
or did I deliberately disobey him?

483
01:02:20,489 --> 01:02:22,658
He wants to know
what Gonzales was doing there.

484
01:02:22,908 --> 01:02:25,494
He wants to know
why we screwed everything up.

485
01:02:25,786 --> 01:02:27,496
What am I going to tell him?

486
01:02:30,041 --> 01:02:32,376
Why don't you start
by telling him the truth?

487
01:02:33,002 --> 01:02:36,213
Tell him Gonzales was obeying orders
from a superior. Me.

488
01:02:36,422 --> 01:02:39,091
Tell him you didn't know
anything about it.

489
01:02:39,342 --> 01:02:42,762
When this is over, if he wants
my badge, he can have that too.

490
01:02:44,847 --> 01:02:47,558
You wouldn't have a belt of booze
around here, would you?

491
01:02:54,649 --> 01:02:56,734
Lieutenant Bressler's office.

492
01:02:59,612 --> 01:03:01,656
- Put him on.
- What is it?

493
01:03:02,323 --> 01:03:07,536
It's Park Emergency. They just treated
a guy who had a knife wound in the leg.

494
01:03:09,288 --> 01:03:12,291
Yeah, Doctor?
What'd this guy look like?

495
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:14,669
Long blond hair...

496
01:03:14,919 --> 01:03:17,880
...medium build, about 150 pounds.

497
01:03:18,547 --> 01:03:19,715
Pale complexion.

498
01:03:19,965 --> 01:03:23,511
- He didn't give you his name, Doc?
- Nope.

499
01:03:24,679 --> 01:03:26,389
They usually give a phony name.

500
01:03:27,848 --> 01:03:29,850
But I've seen him someplace.

501
01:03:30,393 --> 01:03:34,522
It's important you remember. There's
a 14-year-old girl who's suffocating.

502
01:03:34,814 --> 01:03:36,732
I'm trying to think!

503
01:03:37,024 --> 01:03:38,401
It was...

504
01:03:39,193 --> 01:03:40,861
I believe he works around here.

505
01:03:41,112 --> 01:03:44,198
Doctor, could you give
him something? He's in pain!

506
01:03:44,448 --> 01:03:46,117
Yes, just a moment.

507
01:03:50,371 --> 01:03:51,831
She'll be dead in an hour!

508
01:03:52,081 --> 01:03:54,083
I'm trying to remember!

509
01:03:56,502 --> 01:03:58,421
I've got who he is.

510
01:03:59,255 --> 01:04:03,509
When they had football,
he used to sell programs at the stadium.

511
01:04:04,135 --> 01:04:06,846
I think the groundskeeper
lets him live there.

512
01:04:07,096 --> 01:04:09,765
- Live where?
- There.

513
01:04:14,770 --> 01:04:16,397
Kezar Stadium.

514
01:05:20,878 --> 01:05:23,005
Illegal entry. No warrant.

515
01:05:23,339 --> 01:05:25,091
Looks like we climb.

516
01:05:26,467 --> 01:05:27,968
Too much linguine.

517
01:05:30,179 --> 01:05:31,847
I'll find another way.

518
01:08:49,003 --> 01:08:50,046
Stop!

519
01:09:09,982 --> 01:09:13,194
Don't do anything more!
You tried to kill me!

520
01:09:14,570 --> 01:09:15,738
You need any help?

521
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:21,327
- Go on and get some air, fatso.
- Please! No more!

522
01:09:21,744 --> 01:09:25,289
Can't you see I'm hurt?
You shot me! Please, don't!

523
01:09:25,831 --> 01:09:27,958
Let me have a doctor!

524
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:30,795
Please, get me the doctor!
Don't kill me!

525
01:09:31,337 --> 01:09:32,922
The girl, where is she?

526
01:09:33,172 --> 01:09:34,340
You tried to kill me!

527
01:09:34,590 --> 01:09:38,761
If I did, your head would be splattered
all over this field. Where's the girl?

528
01:09:39,011 --> 01:09:40,179
I want a lawyer.

529
01:09:40,346 --> 01:09:42,264
I said, where's the girl?

530
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,810
- I have the right for one.
- Where's the girl?

531
01:09:47,061 --> 01:09:49,271
I have the right to a lawyer!

532
01:09:50,272 --> 01:09:51,732
Don't! Please!

533
01:09:51,983 --> 01:09:54,485
I have rights. I want a lawyer!

534
01:11:33,042 --> 01:11:35,336
Harry Callahan.
He said it was urgent.

535
01:11:35,628 --> 01:11:39,632
Yes, the district attorney has
been wanting to talk to you.

536
01:11:39,924 --> 01:11:43,135
<i>- It's Inspector Callahan.
- Have him come in, please.</i>

537
01:11:44,178 --> 01:11:46,389
Won't you come this way?

538
01:11:46,806 --> 01:11:50,226
- May I bring you in a cup of coffee?
- No, thanks.

539
01:11:58,901 --> 01:12:00,695
I'll be done in a minute.

540
01:12:01,445 --> 01:12:02,822
Have a seat.

541
01:12:07,243 --> 01:12:10,746
I've just been looking over
your arrest report.

542
01:12:12,331 --> 01:12:15,710
A very unusual piece of police work.

543
01:12:17,461 --> 01:12:18,754
Really amazing.

544
01:12:20,006 --> 01:12:21,257
I had some luck.

545
01:12:21,507 --> 01:12:25,261
You're lucky I'm not indicting you for
assault with intent to commit murder!

546
01:12:29,015 --> 01:12:33,060
Where does it say you've got a right
to kick down doors, torture suspects?

547
01:12:33,311 --> 01:12:37,231
Deny medical attention and legal
counsel? Where have you been?

548
01:12:38,024 --> 01:12:40,735
Does Escobedo ring a bell?
Miranda?

549
01:12:42,528 --> 01:12:45,448
You must have heard
of the 4th Amendment!

550
01:12:46,866 --> 01:12:49,702
What I'm saying is,
that man had rights.

551
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,998
I'm all broken up
about that man's rights.

552
01:12:54,206 --> 01:12:56,542
You should be.
I've got news for you.

553
01:12:56,751 --> 01:12:59,462
When he's well enough
to leave the hospital, he walks.

554
01:13:00,796 --> 01:13:02,298
What are you talking about?

555
01:13:02,548 --> 01:13:03,716
He's free!

556
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:05,926
You're letting him go?

557
01:13:06,177 --> 01:13:07,970
We have to.
We can't try him.

558
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:09,472
And why is that?

559
01:13:09,722 --> 01:13:12,725
Because I'm not wasting
1/2 million tax dollars...

560
01:13:12,975 --> 01:13:15,227
...on a trial we can't possibly win.

561
01:13:15,686 --> 01:13:18,189
The problem is,
we don't have any evidence.

562
01:13:18,564 --> 01:13:21,359
- What do you call that?
- I call it nothing.

563
01:13:21,817 --> 01:13:23,027
Zero.

564
01:13:24,445 --> 01:13:28,199
You're saying that Ballistics can't
match the bullet up to this rifle?

565
01:13:28,491 --> 01:13:31,452
It does not matter
what Ballistics can do!

566
01:13:31,911 --> 01:13:34,789
This rifle might make a nice souvenir.

567
01:13:35,873 --> 01:13:38,417
- But it's inadmissible as evidence!
- Who says?

568
01:13:38,709 --> 01:13:39,877
It's the law.

569
01:13:40,628 --> 01:13:42,088
Then the law is crazy!

570
01:13:43,172 --> 01:13:46,092
This is Judge Bannerman
of the appellate court.

571
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:51,180
He holds classes in constitutional
law. I've asked him for an opinion.

572
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:52,515
Your Honor?

573
01:13:53,808 --> 01:13:58,646
In my opinion, the search
of the suspect's quarters was illegal.

574
01:13:58,854 --> 01:14:03,025
Evidence obtained thereby, such as
that hunting rifle for instance...

575
01:14:03,275 --> 01:14:05,194
...is inadmissible in court.

576
01:14:05,444 --> 01:14:09,407
You should have gotten
a search warrant. I'm sorry.

577
01:14:09,615 --> 01:14:12,910
- It's that simple.
- Search warrant? A girl was dying!

578
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:16,205
She was, in fact, dead
according to the medical report!

579
01:14:16,455 --> 01:14:17,623
But I didn't know that!

580
01:14:18,207 --> 01:14:23,045
The court would recognize the officer's
legitimate concern for the girl...

581
01:14:23,337 --> 01:14:27,466
...but there is no way they can
possibly condone police torture.

582
01:14:28,217 --> 01:14:31,804
All evidence concerning the girl,
the suspect's confession...

583
01:14:32,054 --> 01:14:33,306
...physical evidence...

584
01:14:33,514 --> 01:14:35,850
...would have to be excluded.

585
01:14:41,731 --> 01:14:43,816
There must be something
you can get him on!

586
01:14:44,025 --> 01:14:47,028
Without the evidence
of the gun and the girl?

587
01:14:47,820 --> 01:14:50,573
I couldn't convict him
of spitting on the sidewalk!

588
01:14:52,283 --> 01:14:54,702
Now, the suspect's rights...

589
01:14:54,952 --> 01:14:56,746
...were violated...

590
01:14:56,996 --> 01:14:59,165
...under the 4th and 5th...

591
01:14:59,415 --> 01:15:02,209
...and probably the 6th
and 14th Amendments.

592
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:05,004
And Ann Mary Deacon,
what about her rights?

593
01:15:05,254 --> 01:15:08,341
She's raped and left in a hole to die!
Who speaks for her?

594
01:15:08,591 --> 01:15:10,134
The district attorney's office!

595
01:15:11,135 --> 01:15:12,845
If you'll let us.

596
01:15:14,513 --> 01:15:18,601
I have a wife and 3 kids. I don't want
him on the streets any more than you do.

597
01:15:18,934 --> 01:15:20,686
He won't be out there long.

598
01:15:20,936 --> 01:15:23,105
What is that supposed to mean?

599
01:15:23,564 --> 01:15:26,525
Sooner or later he will stub his toe
and I'll be there.

600
01:15:26,776 --> 01:15:29,445
This office won't stand
for any harassment!

601
01:15:30,154 --> 01:15:34,408
You're crazy if you think you've heard
the last of him. He will kill again.

602
01:15:34,784 --> 01:15:36,285
How do you know?

603
01:15:37,578 --> 01:15:39,330
Because he likes it.

604
01:18:06,852 --> 01:18:08,604
You sure you weren't tailed?

605
01:18:09,146 --> 01:18:10,314
Yeah.

606
01:18:35,047 --> 01:18:37,300
You really want $200 worth.

607
01:18:38,384 --> 01:18:40,303
Every penny of it.

608
01:18:54,608 --> 01:18:56,068
Might as well be comfortable.

609
01:18:56,777 --> 01:18:58,404
Go on, sit.

610
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:07,621
Relax.

611
01:19:08,831 --> 01:19:10,791
Take it easy.

612
01:19:11,167 --> 01:19:13,461
It's going to be all right.

613
01:19:54,835 --> 01:19:57,088
You sure you want the rest of it?

614
01:19:57,838 --> 01:19:59,590
Every penny's worth!

615
01:20:01,133 --> 01:20:04,595
You black son of a bitch!

616
01:20:26,283 --> 01:20:28,744
This one's on the house.

617
01:20:43,342 --> 01:20:44,927
That's got to be him.

618
01:20:47,513 --> 01:20:51,642
Are you claiming that the
San Francisco Police did this to you?

619
01:20:51,892 --> 01:20:53,811
I swear it. As God is my judge.

620
01:20:54,061 --> 01:20:56,188
Why are they harassing you?

621
01:20:56,439 --> 01:20:58,399
They tried to frame me with the murder.

622
01:20:58,691 --> 01:21:01,527
And now they're trying to murder me.
And look at me!

623
01:21:01,819 --> 01:21:05,990
I'm innocent until proven guilty
and look at what they did to me.

624
01:21:06,282 --> 01:21:09,452
Everywhere I go cops follow me.
And just look at me!

625
01:21:10,036 --> 01:21:12,997
Just a minute, nurse.
Let me ask him one more question.

626
01:21:13,205 --> 01:21:15,249
Did you see who did this to you?

627
01:21:15,499 --> 01:21:16,667
Can you identify him?

628
01:21:16,959 --> 01:21:21,547
<i>His name is Callahan. He's a big cop.
Works Homicide. Callahan.</i>

629
01:21:24,008 --> 01:21:27,136
Now, that's the rerun
from the 4 o'clock news.

630
01:21:27,386 --> 01:21:30,348
<i>Since then he's given
a statement to The Chronicle.</i>

631
01:21:30,848 --> 01:21:34,101
He claims you've been following him.
And beat him up.

632
01:21:35,102 --> 01:21:36,896
What about it, Harry?

633
01:21:37,813 --> 01:21:40,316
- You want my star?
- I want an answer.

634
01:21:40,566 --> 01:21:42,276
Have you been following him?

635
01:21:43,944 --> 01:21:47,448
Yeah, I've been following him
on my own time.

636
01:21:47,865 --> 01:21:50,117
- Anybody can tell I didn't do that.
- How?

637
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:53,579
Because he looks
too damn good, that's how!

638
01:21:54,372 --> 01:21:57,041
Before I let you go,
let's get one thing straight.

639
01:21:57,291 --> 01:22:00,002
I don't want any more surveillance!

640
01:22:00,961 --> 01:22:02,713
Neither does he.

641
01:22:04,674 --> 01:22:05,758
What does that mean?

642
01:22:07,551 --> 01:22:09,178
Good night, sir.

643
01:22:13,057 --> 01:22:14,767
Go ahead. Try them.

644
01:22:15,351 --> 01:22:18,896
- Guy makes them where I always eat.
- Thank you.

645
01:22:19,188 --> 01:22:21,857
I talked to Bressler
about being on with me.

646
01:22:22,858 --> 01:22:25,528
So you know you got a spot
when you get out.

647
01:22:26,195 --> 01:22:29,281
I don't know
if I am coming back, Harry.

648
01:22:32,451 --> 01:22:35,579
Doing a lot of thinking
about it and...

649
01:22:37,581 --> 01:22:40,876
I have a teaching credential.
And I figure...

650
01:22:41,585 --> 01:22:43,587
...what for? You know?

651
01:22:46,966 --> 01:22:49,885
- Time for therapy.
- You hang in there now.

652
01:22:55,891 --> 01:22:58,060
See you tomorrow. Same time?

653
01:23:20,916 --> 01:23:23,669
- It's my fault, you know.
- What?

654
01:23:24,295 --> 01:23:26,672
His leaving.
I thought I could take it.

655
01:23:26,922 --> 01:23:28,424
No class.

656
01:23:29,175 --> 01:23:31,385
- Don't ever say that.
- What?

657
01:23:31,636 --> 01:23:33,512
Don't ever low-rate yourself.

658
01:23:34,096 --> 01:23:37,767
What I meant was, whatever it takes
to be a cop's wife...

659
01:23:38,017 --> 01:23:40,061
...I'm just not sure I'm making it.

660
01:23:40,311 --> 01:23:42,855
He really tries,
and all these bastards...

661
01:23:43,105 --> 01:23:45,399
..."pig" this and "pig" that.

662
01:23:46,651 --> 01:23:50,404
But maybe it's when I watch him
walk out that door at night.

663
01:23:50,696 --> 01:23:51,947
And I think...

664
01:23:53,115 --> 01:23:55,576
...what if it's the last time
I see him?

665
01:23:56,661 --> 01:23:58,329
Am I the only one?

666
01:23:58,621 --> 01:24:00,581
Doesn't it drive your wife crazy?

667
01:24:00,873 --> 01:24:01,999
No.

668
01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:05,294
You mean she got used to it?

669
01:24:05,795 --> 01:24:07,588
No, she never did, really.

670
01:24:07,838 --> 01:24:09,131
What, then?

671
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,384
She's dead.

672
01:24:12,134 --> 01:24:13,844
Please, forgive me.

673
01:24:14,553 --> 01:24:17,765
She was driving home
and a drunk crossed the center line.

674
01:24:18,015 --> 01:24:19,475
No reason for it, really.

675
01:24:20,351 --> 01:24:22,603
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

676
01:24:23,354 --> 01:24:25,022
I want you to tell Chico...

677
01:24:25,898 --> 01:24:28,109
...that I understand him quitting.

678
01:24:28,359 --> 01:24:31,529
I think he's right.
This is no life for you two.

679
01:24:32,154 --> 01:24:35,324
- Why do you stay in it, then?
- I don't know.

680
01:24:36,951 --> 01:24:38,327
I really don't.

681
01:25:15,656 --> 01:25:17,908
Let me have a fifth of Seagram's.
Please.

682
01:25:19,368 --> 01:25:21,287
What the hell happened to you?

683
01:25:21,537 --> 01:25:23,497
My wife's brother.

684
01:25:23,748 --> 01:25:24,874
I hit her...

685
01:25:25,124 --> 01:25:26,792
...so he hit me.

686
01:25:27,043 --> 01:25:28,544
Several times.

687
01:25:30,087 --> 01:25:31,547
$5.69.

688
01:25:33,549 --> 01:25:36,636
You're the guy
that's been robbed all these times.

689
01:25:36,886 --> 01:25:39,347
14 times the last 3 years.

690
01:25:39,555 --> 01:25:42,558
Last 2 times, I sent them
out of here on platters.

691
01:25:42,850 --> 01:25:45,394
I'm getting to be a pretty good shot.

692
01:25:46,562 --> 01:25:50,399
And I always keep it right here.
Right where it's handy.

693
01:25:50,608 --> 01:25:53,110
Please, I scare easy.

694
01:25:56,364 --> 01:25:59,075
Dirty son of a bitch! You pilferer!

695
01:26:35,611 --> 01:26:36,737
Goodbye.

696
01:26:38,030 --> 01:26:39,824
See you tomorrow.

697
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:52,461
Everybody out who gets out here?

698
01:26:52,795 --> 01:26:54,380
School bus inspector.

699
01:26:54,588 --> 01:26:57,216
One minute.
I'm not allowed to have anybody...

700
01:26:57,425 --> 01:26:59,051
I'm authorizing it, so go.

701
01:26:59,343 --> 01:27:01,137
What are you doing?
I don't know you.

702
01:27:01,387 --> 01:27:05,683
Hear me, old hag. Drive or I'll
decorate this bus with your brains.

703
01:27:07,768 --> 01:27:11,397
- Where?
- Just get started. I'll tell you where.

704
01:27:16,152 --> 01:27:17,695
Let's have some fun now.

705
01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:19,488
Who knows a song?

706
01:27:19,655 --> 01:27:22,742
Everybody knows a song. You?
You must know a beautiful one.

707
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:25,036
Come on, sing for us.

708
01:29:08,389 --> 01:29:12,268
- Millie, this is Inspector Callahan.
- The Mayor is waiting for you.

709
01:29:16,605 --> 01:29:19,191
- What's up?
- Another note from our boy.

710
01:29:19,442 --> 01:29:23,529
- Who's he grabbed now?
- That's the trouble, we don't know yet.

711
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:28,492
The jet must be fueled and
ready to go in half an hour.

712
01:29:29,076 --> 01:29:32,079
Skeleton crew.
They must be volunteers.

713
01:29:32,663 --> 01:29:34,540
Tell them the man is dangerous.

714
01:29:34,832 --> 01:29:38,586
I'll read you this note which
was delivered at 8:00 this morning.

715
01:29:38,919 --> 01:29:40,338
"To the City of San Francisco.

716
01:29:40,546 --> 01:29:43,090
You double-crossed me
for the last time.

717
01:29:43,341 --> 01:29:48,054
I'm warning you to have my $200,000
in a jet airplane ready and waiting.

718
01:29:48,804 --> 01:29:52,558
I'll call the Mayor's office at 1:00
and tell you about the hostages...

719
01:29:52,808 --> 01:29:55,394
...who I will be happy to kill
if you don't do...

720
01:29:55,645 --> 01:29:58,022
...exactly what I say. Scorpio."

721
01:30:00,983 --> 01:30:03,069
Better have somebody standing by!

722
01:30:03,319 --> 01:30:05,196
I don't think it's a false alarm.

723
01:30:05,446 --> 01:30:07,698
<i>There's a call for you on line 2.</i>

724
01:30:07,907 --> 01:30:10,326
<i>I think it's the one
you've been waiting for.</i>

725
01:30:16,999 --> 01:30:19,877
<i>- It's the Mayor.
- I got 7 kids from Park Street School.</i>

726
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:23,547
I got the bus and...

727
01:30:23,839 --> 01:30:27,343
Come on, honey, now back in the bus.
That's a good girl.

728
01:30:27,593 --> 01:30:29,428
I got the bus driver.
Here she is.

729
01:30:29,762 --> 01:30:31,222
Just tell him.

730
01:30:31,681 --> 01:30:33,140
Not my fault, he had a gun...

731
01:30:33,349 --> 01:30:34,266
Just your name!

732
01:30:38,312 --> 01:30:39,772
<i>This is Marcella Platt.</i>

733
01:30:41,649 --> 01:30:44,193
<i>You can check if you want.
But I don 't see any point.</i>

734
01:30:44,443 --> 01:30:45,987
<i>I'm not bullshitting.</i>

735
01:30:46,195 --> 01:30:49,323
<i>It's simple. I got the kids.
You start screwing around...</i>

736
01:30:49,532 --> 01:30:51,075
<i>... the kids start dying.</i>

737
01:30:51,325 --> 01:30:54,954
<i>- The plane ready?
- It's being fueled, and ready to go.</i>

738
01:30:55,162 --> 01:30:57,957
<i>The money will be there
by the time you get there.</i>

739
01:30:58,165 --> 01:31:01,294
<i>Listen carefully.
I will drive along nice and easy.</i>

740
01:31:01,585 --> 01:31:03,546
<i>Just me and a busload of kids.</i>

741
01:31:03,879 --> 01:31:07,091
<i>I'll turn off at Sir Francis Drake
on my way to Santa Rosa Airport.</i>

742
01:31:07,341 --> 01:31:09,176
<i>I don 't want any police cars...</i>

743
01:31:09,385 --> 01:31:10,553
<i>... helicopters, whatever.</i>

744
01:31:10,928 --> 01:31:15,016
If you play this game by the rules,
the kids will have a nice plane ride.

745
01:31:15,224 --> 01:31:17,018
Where are you going?

746
01:31:17,601 --> 01:31:20,813
I'll tell the pilot
when I get on. No alerts.

747
01:31:22,690 --> 01:31:25,901
I guarantee you, you will not
be molested in any way.

748
01:31:26,152 --> 01:31:27,695
I give you my word of honor.

749
01:31:29,071 --> 01:31:30,990
Marcella Platt. It checks.

750
01:31:35,286 --> 01:31:37,455
Willing to take the money to him?

751
01:31:37,747 --> 01:31:41,959
When will you stop messing around with
this guy? He has to be stopped now!

752
01:31:42,335 --> 01:31:45,296
He's got a busload of kids
and I can't take that chance.

753
01:31:45,921 --> 01:31:48,883
I gave my word of honor
and he will not be molested!

754
01:31:49,091 --> 01:31:50,760
And that's a direct order!

755
01:31:52,803 --> 01:31:56,140
You can just get yourself
another delivery boy.

756
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:31,736
Where are we going?

757
01:33:32,737 --> 01:33:36,449
- This isn't the right way!
- We're going to the ice cream factory.

758
01:33:36,657 --> 01:33:38,576
Anyone doesn't want to, can get off.

759
01:33:38,784 --> 01:33:41,412
I want to go home to my mother.

760
01:33:41,662 --> 01:33:42,830
Go home to your what?

761
01:33:43,748 --> 01:33:45,458
Now, sing! Sing again!

762
01:33:47,543 --> 01:33:49,295
What's the matter?
Don't you sing?

763
01:33:51,130 --> 01:33:53,257
Are you sick?
What is it?

764
01:33:54,091 --> 01:33:56,677
Sing or your mothers will die!

765
01:33:56,927 --> 01:33:59,639
I'll kill your mothers!
And the rest of you!

766
01:34:06,979 --> 01:34:08,898
Get in the right-hand lane.

767
01:34:09,148 --> 01:34:11,525
Not right to treat children that way.

768
01:34:11,734 --> 01:34:14,236
- You'll hurt them.
- Just drive the goddamn bus!

769
01:34:14,487 --> 01:34:16,572
And get in the right-hand lane!

770
01:34:23,454 --> 01:34:25,581
I want my mother.

771
01:34:33,923 --> 01:34:35,591
The sign, Sir Drake Blvd.

772
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:36,884
Make a right there.

773
01:34:37,718 --> 01:34:40,972
There's a sign to Sir Drake Boulevard!

774
01:34:41,639 --> 01:34:43,516
Not this one.

775
01:34:44,141 --> 01:34:45,518
I want my mother.

776
01:34:46,811 --> 01:34:47,853
Shut up!

777
01:34:49,897 --> 01:34:51,440
Just get to the right!

778
01:35:06,414 --> 01:35:07,999
Jesus!

779
01:35:16,090 --> 01:35:18,634
What the hell is he doing up there?

780
01:35:23,306 --> 01:35:26,392
What the hell are you doing?
Pass the V.W., will you?

781
01:38:45,883 --> 01:38:47,468
Drop the gun, creep!

782
01:38:50,304 --> 01:38:52,390
I'll blow his brains out.

783
01:38:55,893 --> 01:38:57,561
Drop the fucking gun!

784
01:39:45,026 --> 01:39:46,694
I know what you're thinking.

785
01:39:47,987 --> 01:39:51,490
You're thinking,
did he fire 6 shots, or only 5?

786
01:39:52,450 --> 01:39:55,786
To tell you the truth, I forgot
myself, in all this excitement.

787
01:39:56,787 --> 01:40:00,541
But being this is a.44 Magnum, the
most powerful handgun in the world...

788
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:03,461
...and will blow your head
clean off...

789
01:40:03,753 --> 01:40:05,671
...you've got to ask yourself:

790
01:40:07,048 --> 01:40:08,758
"Do I feel lucky?"

791
01:40:14,722 --> 01:40:16,891
Well, do you, punk?

792
01:42:13,966 --> 01:42:15,009
