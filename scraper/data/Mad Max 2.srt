1
00:01:32,177 --> 00:01:34,179
<i>My life fades...</i>

2
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:36,681
<i>...the vision dims.</i>

3
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,351
<i>All that remains are memories.</i>

4
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:45,398
<i>I remember a time of chaos...</i>

5
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:49,861
<i>ruined dreams, this wasted land</i>

6
00:01:50,904 --> 00:01:55,074
<i>But most of all,
I remember the Road Warrior...</i>

7
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:58,119
<i>...the man we called Max.</i>

8
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:02,957
<i>To understand who he was,
you have to go back to another time...</i>

9
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:06,795
<i>...when the world was powered
by the black fuel...</i>

10
00:02:07,337 --> 00:02:11,591
<i>...and the deserts sprouted
great cities of pipe and steel.</i>

11
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:16,763
<i>Gone now, swept</i> away.

12
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:21,893
<i>For reasons long forgotten,
two mighty warrior tribes went to war...</i>

13
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,563
<i>...and touched off a blaze
which engulfed them all.</i>

14
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:30,235
<i>Without fuel they were nothing.
They'd built a house of straw.</i>

15
00:02:30,944 --> 00:02:34,280
<i>The thundering machines
sputtered and stopped.</i>

16
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:41,663
<i>Their leaders talked and talked and talked.</i>

17
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:47,502
<i>But nothing could stem the avalanche.</i>

18
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:50,588
<i>Their world crumbled...</i>

19
00:02:51,548 --> 00:02:53,591
<i>...the cities exploded.</i>

20
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:56,302
<i>A whirlwind of looting...</i>

21
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,514
<i>...a firestorm of fear.</i>

22
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:03,017
<i>Men began to feed on men.</i>

23
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:08,064
<i>On the roads,
it was</i> a <i>white-line nightmare</i>

24
00:03:08,773 --> 00:03:11,442
<i>Only those mobile enough to scavenge...</i>

25
00:03:11,985 --> 00:03:14,737
<i>...brutal enough to pillage, would survive.</i>

26
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:18,116
<i>The gangs took over the highways...</i>

27
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:22,161
<i>...ready to wage war for a tank of juice.</i>

28
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:26,249
<i>And in this maelstrom of decay...</i>

29
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:29,586
<i>...ordinary men
were battered and smashed.</i>

30
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,921
<i>Men like</i> Max.

31
00:03:32,672 --> 00:03:34,340
<i>The warrior</i> Max.

32
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:40,471
<i>In the roar of an engine,
he lost everything...</i>

33
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,146
<i>...and became a shell of a man.</i>

34
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:51,065
<i>A burnt-out, desolate man.</i>

35
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:55,945
<i>A man haunted by the demons of his past.</i>

36
00:03:56,946 --> 00:04:00,491
<i>A man who wandered out
into the wasteland.</i>

37
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:03,870
<i>And it was here...</i>

38
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,123
<i>...in this blighted place...</i>

39
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,252
<i>...that he learned to live again.</i>

40
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,726
Don't hurt the snake. Put it down.

41
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:45,396
Gently, gently. Nice. Nice.

42
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:47,064
Now the iron.

43
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:51,527
The gun.

44
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:55,781
Down, down. Turn around.

45
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,963
Looks like I got myself some gasoline, eh?

46
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:13,299
V8?

47
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:17,762
Booby-trapped.
Touch those tanks and:

48
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:28,647
Booby trap. Back up.

49
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:33,361
Oh, you crafty little man, you.

50
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:36,364
You're quick, very quick.

51
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:41,619
Never seen a man beat the snake before.
Who are you?

52
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:47,124
Reflexes. Yeah. That's what you've got.

53
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:51,295
Me, I got brains.

54
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:56,592
Hey!

55
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:01,263
A fella, a quick fella...

56
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:06,102
...might have a weapon under there.
I'd have to pin his head to the panel.

57
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,658
Hey. Hey, hey-

58
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:25,538
Don't play me the fool.

59
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:35,881
Gas, fuel, gasoline!
Thousands of gallons of it!

60
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:38,217
- As much as you want!
- Where? Where?

61
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:41,679
Twenty miles from here.
Pumping it, they are. Refining!

62
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:45,099
- A huge tanker full.
- Crap.

63
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:47,685
No. No, no, no, it's true! It's true.

64
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:50,938
It's not self-service, no, no.
It's too hard for me.

65
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:54,024
- But a man of your ingenuity...
- Where? Where? Where?

66
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:57,528
Kill me and you'll never find out.

67
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,509
Good dog. Nice doggy, eh?

68
00:13:21,594 --> 00:13:22,970
Good doggy.

69
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:30,895
Bless you, dog.

70
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:57,963
Well, there it is.

71
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:02,927
Four days I was up here...

72
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:07,431
...me and the snakes,
playing mahjong, taking tea...

73
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:10,392
...watching, thinking...

74
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:14,104
...how was I gonna
get in and get the gas?

75
00:14:16,232 --> 00:14:18,442
Day and night it's pumping.

76
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:23,113
Fuel to burn.

77
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,826
They've got the lot.
Power, lights, you name it.

78
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:31,580
You can bet your life they mean to keep it.

79
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:34,250
Thirty of them in there.

80
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,919
Arrows, flamethrowers, guns.

81
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:41,006
No place for man or reptile, I thought.

82
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:44,301
Then this trash arrived...

83
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:47,137
...as moths to a flame.

84
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:50,349
Round and round, attack, attack...

85
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:55,062
...like angry ants,
mad with the smell of gasoline.

86
00:15:10,995 --> 00:15:14,123
In the tanker, that's where they keep it.

87
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:18,168
Thousands of gallons.
As much as you want.

88
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:23,507
If anyone's gonna get in there,
it's gonna be you.

89
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:27,136
Me, I'm gonna feed the snakes.

90
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:34,768
A man lives by his word, I reckon,
and I've kept mine, eh?

91
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:47,156
Look, we had a deal. I show you the gas
and you let me go, right?

92
00:15:47,323 --> 00:15:51,285
- The arrangement was I wouldn't kill you.
- After all I've done for you...

93
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,413
I reckon you got a bargain, don't you?

94
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:25,194
<i>Attack, my vermin, attack!</i>

95
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:53,597
<i>Onward! Bring me the fuel.
For the glory of Humungus.</i>

96
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,225
<i>For the great glory of Humungus.</i>

97
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:03,065
<i>Smegma crazies to the left!</i>

98
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,779
<i>The gate! Gayboy berserkers to the gate!</i>

99
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:17,454
<i>I am your Lord.</i>

100
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,669
<i>Attack!</i>

101
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,703
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

102
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,080
Save it

103
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,791
I'm just here for the gasoline.

104
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,251
Yeah. Yeah.

105
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:26,842
As much as you like.

106
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:28,969
Just take me back there.

107
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:18,435
Show your weapons and come forward!

108
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:24,149
Steady now.

109
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:28,153
Take it real easy.

110
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:31,323
That's as far as you go.

111
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:33,450
Turn around.

112
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:37,829
- Nathan! Nathan! It's Nathan!
- Hurry, get the stretcher!

113
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:39,247
Lose them.

114
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,002
Open the gate.

115
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:51,551
Hurry up with that damned stretcher.

116
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:53,011
Nathan!

117
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:56,139
Hey, that's fine. It's fine. Just stay here.

118
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,433
Cover him. Cover him.

119
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,687
Come on, quick. Quick.

120
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:05,273
Oh, what a waste!

121
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:07,984
Watch his leg.

122
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:13,031
You and your handiwork!

123
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:14,991
He didn't stand a chance!

124
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:18,870
Oh, I warned him. You all heard me.
"Madness," I said.

125
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,499
"We can escape, take our gas," he said.
"How?" I said.

126
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,793
Get that machine inside.
Charlie, help me--

127
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,169
Derek?

128
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:34,511
Get that machine inside.

129
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:36,763
Close the damned gate.

130
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,182
Mind your backs, mind your backs.
Coming through.

131
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:53,905
All right, give him room, give him room.

132
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,868
Who are you?

133
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:02,038
How did you get through out there?

134
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:05,125
Look, I want some answers.
Where did you find him?

135
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:08,878
Two or three miles down the road,
left for dead. We had a deal.

136
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,339
There were three other vehicles.
Did you see them?

137
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:13,883
They're heading to the southwest
in heaps of trouble.

138
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,553
He said if I brought him back,
you'd give me some gas.

139
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,889
- Now, there's not much time.
- There was a woman in the car.

140
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:22,350
She's dead.

141
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,270
What did they do?

142
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:28,231
It was quick. I just want my gas,
I wanna get out of here.

143
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:30,775
For all we know, he's one of them.
Give him nothing.

144
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:32,610
She's right, he's a parasite.

145
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:35,655
Trading in human flesh. Mercenary trash.

146
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:39,826
- We had an arrangement.
- What do you mean, an arrangement?

147
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:41,745
You talk to this man.

148
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:45,957
No, no. Try something. Try something.

149
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:02,057
If you had a contract, it was with him.

150
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:03,933
And it died with him.

151
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,102
- Get rid of him.
- Move it.

152
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:07,604
Left!

153
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:11,441
Left.

154
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:18,531
Gotta hand it to you, treasure.
The last of the V8 Interceptors.

155
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:20,408
A piece of history.

156
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:24,329
Would have been a shame to blow it up.

157
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:35,256
Let him go!

158
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:38,927
It's all right, mate.

159
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:42,722
Here they come! Close the gates!
They're coming back!

160
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:56,421
Hold your fire! He comes in peace!

161
00:29:56,796 --> 00:30:01,217
For Christ's sake, hold your fire!

162
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:56,439
Greetings from the Humungus!

163
00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:58,775
The Lord Humungus!

164
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:02,278
The Warrior of the Wasteland!

165
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:08,117
The Ayatollah of Rock 'n' Roll-ah!

166
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:13,039
I am gravely disappointed.

167
00:31:13,623 --> 00:31:16,793
Again you have made me
unleash my dogs of war.

168
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,295
- Look at what remains...
- Help!

169
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:21,464
-...Of your gallant scouts.
- Kill him now...

170
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:24,926
- Why? Because you're selfish.
-...while you've got the chance.

171
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:26,803
You hoard your gasoline.

172
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:30,223
- You will not listen to reason.
- Don't listen to him!

173
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,475
Now, my prisoners say...

174
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:36,062
...you plan to take your gasoline
out of the wasteland.

175
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:39,857
You sent them out this morning
to find a vehicle.

176
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,696
A rig big enough to haul
that fat tank of gas.

177
00:31:45,488 --> 00:31:47,156
What a puny plan.

178
00:31:47,782 --> 00:31:49,367
Look around you.

179
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:53,955
This is the Valley of Death.

180
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:55,164
See!

181
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:59,836
Nothing can escape!
The Humungus rules the wasteland!

182
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:04,173
Give them nothing. Blow it up.
Give them--

183
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:08,886
Humungus will not be defied.

184
00:32:30,575 --> 00:32:32,327
Wez. Wez.

185
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:34,370
Listen to me!

186
00:32:41,252 --> 00:32:43,046
I got it. I got it.

187
00:32:51,262 --> 00:32:52,263
Good one.

188
00:32:57,518 --> 00:33:00,688
Quiet. Quiet. No more games.

189
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:03,316
No more games!

190
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:05,860
We are here for a purpose.

191
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:08,237
We've come with an offer.

192
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:15,078
No. No more talk.

193
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:17,580
We go in. We kill.

194
00:33:17,747 --> 00:33:19,874
We'll kill them!

195
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:26,005
We'll kill them! Kill them. Kill them!

196
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:29,926
Do you see him?

197
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:35,098
Kill! Kill!

198
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:40,061
Be still, my dog of war.

199
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:42,230
I understand your pain.

200
00:33:42,522 --> 00:33:46,442
We all lost someone we love.
But we do it my way.

201
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,569
Losers. Losers wait.

202
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:50,780
We do it my way.

203
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:55,576
Their fear is our ally.
The gasoline will be ours.

204
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:58,913
Then you shall have your revenge.

205
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:05,670
Take him away.

206
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:24,397
There has been too much violence,
too much pain.

207
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:27,150
None here are without sin.

208
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:30,653
But I have an honorable compromise.

209
00:34:31,654 --> 00:34:33,197
Just walk away.

210
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:35,491
Give me the pump...

211
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:37,160
...the oil...

212
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:39,287
...the gasoline...

213
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:43,291
...and the whole compound,
and I'll spare your lives.

214
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,421
Just walk away. I will give you
safe passage in the wasteland.

215
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:52,675
Just walk away
and there will be an end to the horror.

216
00:34:58,181 --> 00:34:59,932
I await your answer.

217
00:35:00,391 --> 00:35:02,727
You have one full day to decide.

218
00:35:30,213 --> 00:35:32,048
We'll never walk away!

219
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:34,550
Never!

220
00:35:56,197 --> 00:35:59,283
You heard what he said.
It sounds reasonable.

221
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:02,078
We don't have to die.

222
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:04,789
All we have to do is walk away.

223
00:36:04,956 --> 00:36:06,290
No. We've worked too hard.

224
00:36:06,457 --> 00:36:10,545
It's simple. All we do is change the fuel
and this junkyard for our lives.

225
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:13,089
Look, if we walk out there,
they'll slaughter us.

226
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:16,467
They'll set us loose
and then cut us down like pigs.

227
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:18,010
Don't listen to them.

228
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:20,596
All right. All right. This is it.

229
00:36:20,972 --> 00:36:23,099
I'll talk to this Humungus.

230
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,600
Fool.

231
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:26,644
He's a reasonable man...

232
00:36:27,645 --> 00:36:29,605
...open to negotiation.

233
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:33,067
He promised us safe passage.
He gave his word.

234
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:35,486
And let us suppose he keeps it...

235
00:36:36,112 --> 00:36:39,699
...and we walk away from here
with our lives. What then?

236
00:37:48,976 --> 00:37:50,478
But remember.

237
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:54,273
Remember one thing.
That is more than just a tanker of gas.

238
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,861
That is our lifeline to a place
beyond that vermin on machines.

239
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:01,822
That's 2,000 miles from here!

240
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:05,576
How do you expect us to get it there?
Drag it?

241
00:38:05,743 --> 00:38:08,537
If we have to, yes. There's always a way.

242
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:11,248
But the first step...

243
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:13,876
...defend the fuel.

244
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:16,295
Words.

245
00:38:17,046 --> 00:38:18,422
Just words!

246
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,716
You'd die for a pipe dream!

247
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:23,719
Wrong. We fight for a belief. I stay.

248
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:35,231
I wish it could have worked, Pappagallo.

249
00:38:35,398 --> 00:38:37,650
You can't expect to compete with that.

250
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:41,779
Every day we get weaker
while they get stronger. It's finished.

251
00:38:42,405 --> 00:38:43,739
I'm sorry.

252
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,624
Two days ago I saw a vehicle
that'd haul that tanker.

253
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:57,503
You wanna get out of here...

254
00:38:58,129 --> 00:38:59,672
...you talk to me.

255
00:39:04,927 --> 00:39:06,929
Okay, so that's my offer.

256
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:09,515
I deliver a rig big enough
to haul that tanker...

257
00:39:09,682 --> 00:39:13,102
...you give me back my vehicle
and as much juice as I can carry.

258
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:15,438
We lost eight good people this morning.

259
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,817
What's he got in mind?

260
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:23,362
Now, to do the job
I need five gallons of diesel...

261
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:25,531
...and some high-octane gasoline.

262
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:31,162
Think of it as a down payment.

263
00:39:31,454 --> 00:39:33,956
And that's the last we'll ever see of him.

264
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:36,292
He has to come back for his wheels.

265
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:38,502
What have we got to lose?

266
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:42,631
You've got yourself a deal.

267
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:10,117
My vehicle and all the juice I can carry.

268
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,670
Come on, dog.

269
00:43:56,719 --> 00:43:59,888
You know what I miss most of all?
Clean women.

270
00:44:00,931 --> 00:44:03,642
Nail polish, perfume...

271
00:44:04,393 --> 00:44:08,230
...the smell of bicycle seats, cocktails...

272
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:10,566
- Shut up.
- Desserts.

273
00:44:11,442 --> 00:44:15,237
Lingerie. Remember lingerie?

274
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,417
I knew it. I knew it'd work.

275
00:44:28,709 --> 00:44:32,629
Lethal. Lethal, these snakes. Born killers.

276
00:44:34,423 --> 00:44:35,424
Down!

277
00:44:35,591 --> 00:44:38,635
It's my snake. I trained it.
I'm gonna eat it.

278
00:44:39,053 --> 00:44:42,181
So find your own. Get out of it.

279
00:44:42,848 --> 00:44:45,768
I've got a recipe for snake. Delicious.

280
00:44:46,602 --> 00:44:49,229
Fricassee of reptile. Get out.

281
00:44:49,646 --> 00:44:51,899
Better than your dog food. No!

282
00:44:52,608 --> 00:44:55,986
Pure protein, minerals, vitamins.

283
00:44:56,487 --> 00:44:58,947
A man's gotta look after himself.

284
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:01,617
Healthy mind, healthy body, dog.

285
00:45:01,825 --> 00:45:05,537
Hey! You are what you eat, I reckon.
Get away!

286
00:45:06,622 --> 00:45:09,458
You two ought to take a look
in the mirror some time.

287
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:11,668
No style, no taste.

288
00:45:13,796 --> 00:45:14,963
Empty-

289
00:45:15,798 --> 00:45:17,633
All this time.

290
00:45:21,804 --> 00:45:24,765
That's dishonest. Low.

291
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:30,604
Let's have a look at this machine of yours.

292
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,816
How do I know that one's not a dud?

293
00:45:34,608 --> 00:45:37,569
- Find out.
- Cool. Cool, cool.

294
00:45:38,654 --> 00:45:42,324
Now, you've gotta understand the basics
of aerodynamics in a thing like this.

295
00:45:42,491 --> 00:45:43,826
Shut up. Shut up.

296
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:32,416
What about me, eh?
You're not gonna leave me here, are you?

297
00:46:35,752 --> 00:46:37,212
Do what you want.

298
00:46:39,381 --> 00:46:41,300
We're partners.

299
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,895
You and me, we're partners.

300
00:46:53,604 --> 00:46:55,063
Partners!

301
00:48:03,465 --> 00:48:04,633
Go. Go.

302
00:51:35,427 --> 00:51:38,054
My dogs, run. The gate.

303
00:51:42,768 --> 00:51:47,063
The gate. The gate. The gate.

304
00:53:07,102 --> 00:53:10,564
You. You can run, but you can't hide.

305
00:53:36,798 --> 00:53:38,800
You did a great job.

306
00:53:39,342 --> 00:53:40,844
That's my man.

307
00:53:41,595 --> 00:53:43,138
That's my man.

308
00:53:43,305 --> 00:53:45,265
Don't go overboard now.

309
00:53:46,433 --> 00:53:49,603
No, don't touch, please.
It's a precision instrument.

310
00:53:52,397 --> 00:53:54,190
Don't touch.

311
00:54:01,698 --> 00:54:03,158
Don't touch.

312
00:54:04,451 --> 00:54:05,493
Go.

313
00:54:08,997 --> 00:54:10,081
Go on.

314
00:54:13,418 --> 00:54:16,171
Tell me, son, this machine of yours...

315
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:19,633
...it can take two, can it?

316
00:54:21,635 --> 00:54:22,886
Possibly.

317
00:54:28,183 --> 00:54:29,309
All right?

318
00:54:29,476 --> 00:54:32,938
I'm okay. Just get them organized,
we're moving out tonight.

319
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:40,362
Okay, listen, everyone.
We're going out tonight.

320
00:54:40,528 --> 00:54:42,906
You all know what to do,
just get on with it.

321
00:54:43,073 --> 00:54:45,700
Timbo, Derek, Pappagallo's been hurt.

322
00:54:47,202 --> 00:54:48,703
How's the rig?

323
00:54:49,871 --> 00:54:51,539
The rig. How is she?

324
00:54:51,706 --> 00:54:53,041
A cracked timing case cover.

325
00:54:53,208 --> 00:54:55,210
It's broken some teeth
off the timing gears.

326
00:54:55,377 --> 00:54:57,087
It's got a cracked timing case cover.

327
00:54:57,253 --> 00:54:59,756
It's broken a couple of teeth
off the timing gears.

328
00:54:59,923 --> 00:55:03,301
- The radiator's damaged at the core.
- The radiator's damaged at the core.

329
00:55:03,468 --> 00:55:06,054
- A cracked water pump.
- It's got a cracked water pump.

330
00:55:06,221 --> 00:55:09,766
- And a fractured injector line.
- And it's got a fractured injector line.

331
00:55:09,933 --> 00:55:13,478
- Well, what does all that mean?
- Yeah, okay, but what does that mean?

332
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,897
- What does that mean?
- Twenty-four hours.

333
00:55:16,064 --> 00:55:17,565
Twenty-four hours.

334
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,276
They've got 12.

335
00:55:21,152 --> 00:55:22,904
- You've got 12.
- Okay.

336
00:55:23,071 --> 00:55:24,072
Okay.

337
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:26,616
Let's get him down. Quick, come on.

338
00:55:32,038 --> 00:55:34,582
Listen, I was wrong about you...

339
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,543
...and I'm sorry.

340
00:55:52,267 --> 00:55:53,393
Heel.

341
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,438
It's been a long time
since I've seen driving like that, man.

342
00:55:56,604 --> 00:55:58,523
You're okay by me, son.

343
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:02,360
With you driving that rig, we got it licked!
Nice to have you aboard, son.

344
00:56:02,527 --> 00:56:05,321
I've been saving those.
I want you to have them.

345
00:56:09,284 --> 00:56:11,161
Thank you, and welcome.

346
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:17,250
It's been a pleasure doing business
with you, but I'm leaving.

347
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:19,294
I'm leaving. Thanks.

348
00:56:26,301 --> 00:56:27,927
Oh, my God, look!

349
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:29,637
Up on the hill!

350
00:56:30,305 --> 00:56:33,058
They're stringing them up, the bastards!

351
00:56:34,934 --> 00:56:36,019
Look!

352
00:56:42,317 --> 00:56:44,444
You have defied me.

353
00:56:45,278 --> 00:56:49,657
You will know the vengeance
of Lord Humungus.

354
00:56:50,784 --> 00:56:52,368
I promise you...

355
00:56:53,328 --> 00:56:54,829
nobody

356
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:59,167
...nobody gets out of here alive.

357
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:54,639
Who's supposed to be helping out
with the drums? Come on!

358
00:57:55,974 --> 00:57:58,893
Hey, don't forget,
don't waste a bit before we leave.

359
00:58:02,063 --> 00:58:03,606
Just wanna catch the pigs.

360
00:58:03,773 --> 00:58:06,067
Come on with the drums, come on!

361
00:58:06,234 --> 00:58:08,361
Is anybody helping over there?

362
00:58:12,198 --> 00:58:13,408
Hey, come on!

363
00:58:46,608 --> 00:58:49,694
What's wrong? Come on.

364
00:58:50,195 --> 00:58:53,656
It just seems really wrong,
sneaking away like this.

365
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:00,830
But you said you wanted to come,
sweetheart.

366
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:02,790
I know I did, but...

367
00:59:03,958 --> 00:59:07,253
Look, you're scared. Now, come on,
it'll be much safer up there.

368
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:09,756
- What are we waiting for, eh?
- No,don%.

369
00:59:11,758 --> 00:59:13,468
This is my family.

370
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:17,430
I'm not gonna leave these people.

371
00:59:18,681 --> 00:59:20,099
I'm staying.

372
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:23,770
I'm sorry.

373
00:59:33,613 --> 00:59:36,699
Come on, keep it together.

374
00:59:53,925 --> 00:59:56,511
I told you, he's leaving.
What did I tell you?

375
00:59:56,678 --> 00:59:58,179
Look, he's leaving.

376
01:00:00,014 --> 01:00:04,394
Look, I don't have time for long speeches.
I want you to drive the tanker.

377
01:00:06,187 --> 01:00:07,355
Sorry.

378
01:00:08,856 --> 01:00:12,068
We had a contract.
I kept my part of the bargain.

379
01:00:13,111 --> 01:00:15,154
We'll make a new contract.

380
01:00:18,908 --> 01:00:20,910
I've got all I need here.

381
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:25,331
You don't have a future.
I could offer you that. Rebuild our lives.

382
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:26,582
Max...

383
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:28,918
...buy a ticket for 2,000 miles.

384
01:00:29,085 --> 01:00:33,381
You have to come, sonny.
This is where we're going. Paradise.

385
01:00:34,215 --> 01:00:36,050
Two thousand miles from here.

386
01:00:36,384 --> 01:00:38,803
Fresh water, plenty of sunshine.

387
01:00:39,345 --> 01:00:41,347
Nothing to do but breed.

388
01:00:43,057 --> 01:00:44,392
No, thanks.

389
01:00:45,143 --> 01:00:48,146
What is it with you, huh?
What are you looking for?

390
01:00:48,813 --> 01:00:51,649
Come on, Max,
everyone's looking for something.

391
01:00:52,233 --> 01:00:54,485
You happy out there, are you?

392
01:00:54,694 --> 01:00:57,447
Wandering?
One day blurring into another?

393
01:00:58,364 --> 01:01:01,242
You're a scavenger, Max.
You're a maggot.

394
01:01:01,909 --> 01:01:03,161
Do you know that?

395
01:01:03,328 --> 01:01:06,080
You're living off the corpse
of the old world.

396
01:01:06,581 --> 01:01:08,791
Tell me your story.
Come on, tell me your story.

397
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:10,460
What burned you out?

398
01:01:10,626 --> 01:01:12,128
Kill one man too many?

399
01:01:12,295 --> 01:01:14,630
See too many people die?
Lose some family?

400
01:01:14,797 --> 01:01:19,093
Oh, so that's it. You lost some family.
That make you something special, does it?

401
01:01:19,677 --> 01:01:20,928
Listen to me.

402
01:01:43,326 --> 01:01:46,120
Do you think
you're the only one that's suffered?

403
01:01:46,537 --> 01:01:50,249
We've all been through it in here.
But we haven't given up.

404
01:01:51,584 --> 01:01:54,295
We're still human beings with dignity.

405
01:01:54,921 --> 01:01:58,549
But you, you're out there
with the garbage.

406
01:01:59,092 --> 01:02:00,635
You're nothing.

407
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:43,761
Get out, kid.

408
01:02:46,681 --> 01:02:48,683
Come on, get out of here.

409
01:03:09,996 --> 01:03:12,623
Go on, get out. Scat. Get out.

410
01:03:44,197 --> 01:03:46,073
You're letting him go?

411
01:03:47,909 --> 01:03:50,244
Well, let's keep his vehicle, at least.

412
01:03:51,037 --> 01:03:54,707
He fulfilled his contract.
He's an honorable man.

413
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:58,920
Okay, so who's gonna drive the tanker?

414
01:04:00,254 --> 01:04:01,339
I am.

415
01:04:28,199 --> 01:04:30,660
They've got you wrong,
you're not a coward.

416
01:04:30,826 --> 01:04:33,287
Stupid maybe, but not a coward.

417
01:04:34,455 --> 01:04:36,791
You're making a serious mistake...

418
01:04:37,917 --> 01:04:40,002
...splitting a great team.

419
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,673
You and me together,
think of the possibilities.

420
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:46,801
See you around, maybe.
Goodbye, good luck.

421
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:15,371
We go!

422
01:05:26,465 --> 01:05:29,176
You disobey me. You puppy.

423
01:06:31,906 --> 01:06:34,241
Toadie, the gas. Hurry up.

424
01:06:42,583 --> 01:06:45,419
Don't waste him. If he's alive...

425
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:47,755
...I want him.

426
01:07:13,948 --> 01:07:18,285
The tanks are full, O, mighty Wez,
and it's all yours!

427
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:14,842
It's all over.

428
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,052
Let's go.

429
01:08:29,398 --> 01:08:31,859
Look, out there. Northwest.

430
01:08:40,034 --> 01:08:41,535
Oh, hell.

431
01:08:44,038 --> 01:08:45,873
You blew it, you fool.

432
01:10:03,158 --> 01:10:05,703
Relax, partner.

433
01:11:42,091 --> 01:11:43,968
I'll be driving the tanker.

434
01:11:45,094 --> 01:11:48,097
We're gonna crash or crash through.

435
01:11:49,765 --> 01:11:53,102
Now at this point, that's all they want.
The tanker.

436
01:11:53,727 --> 01:11:55,854
So they'll come straight after us.

437
01:11:56,021 --> 01:11:58,732
So we'll use that to punch our way out...

438
01:11:59,024 --> 01:12:01,902
...which will give all of you
a very, very good chance.

439
01:12:02,403 --> 01:12:03,904
Now, don't hesitate.

440
01:12:04,071 --> 01:12:08,158
Once you're outside there,
split up and go as hard as you can.

441
01:12:09,535 --> 01:12:11,495
Now, 200 miles to the north...

442
01:12:12,204 --> 01:12:16,583
...there's a place with a bridge
called Powder River.

443
01:12:17,001 --> 01:12:18,919
That's our rendezvous.

444
01:12:20,254 --> 01:12:22,047
Give us till sunset.

445
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:26,677
If we haven't made it by then, keep going.

446
01:12:27,553 --> 01:12:29,722
Good enough for me to build,
but not to ride on?

447
01:12:29,888 --> 01:12:32,474
- You are not coming on this tanker!
- I sweated blood on this...

448
01:12:32,641 --> 01:12:35,352
...and no bastard's gonna tell me
to ride in no school bus!

449
01:12:35,519 --> 01:12:37,104
Okay, settle down!

450
01:12:37,479 --> 01:12:39,606
If it's all the same to you...

451
01:12:41,275 --> 01:12:43,193
...I'll drive that tanker.

452
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:48,115
The offer is closed. Too late for deals.

453
01:12:48,824 --> 01:12:51,326
No deals. I wanna drive that truck.

454
01:12:52,453 --> 01:12:55,289
Why? Why the big change of heart?

455
01:12:55,456 --> 01:12:57,291
Believe me, I haven't got a choice.

456
01:12:57,458 --> 01:12:59,585
And how do you think you'll do it?

457
01:12:59,752 --> 01:13:03,130
I mean, look at you.
You couldn't even drive a wheelchair.

458
01:13:04,631 --> 01:13:07,718
You should look at yourself, Max.
You're a mess.

459
01:13:09,136 --> 01:13:11,013
Come on, cut the crap.

460
01:13:12,806 --> 01:13:15,142
I'm the best chance you've got.

461
01:13:23,484 --> 01:13:25,277
Right, let's get moving.

462
01:14:37,057 --> 01:14:39,268
Move that kid! Get rid of him!

463
01:15:55,636 --> 01:15:56,929
Oh, shit!

464
01:19:12,165 --> 01:19:16,253
Go! Go, go, 90. 99!

465
01:20:26,698 --> 01:20:28,700
I'm all right, I'm all right.

466
01:20:34,915 --> 01:20:36,750
Move it. Move it.

467
01:21:08,532 --> 01:21:10,951
Come on, come on, come on!

468
01:23:06,858 --> 01:23:09,903
The tire! Shoot the tire!

469
01:25:44,182 --> 01:25:46,643
Boy! Come on, jump!

470
01:25:47,685 --> 01:25:48,937
Come on, jump!

471
01:25:49,687 --> 01:25:50,688
I say.

472
01:25:51,564 --> 01:25:52,899
We've won.

473
01:25:53,441 --> 01:25:55,193
It's over, boy.

474
01:27:43,509 --> 01:27:44,636
Hey, kid.

475
01:27:45,553 --> 01:27:47,263
Get the bullet. The bullet.

476
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:49,474
Get up. Go on.

477
01:27:53,645 --> 01:27:55,146
Get the shell.

478
01:27:56,814 --> 01:27:58,191
Get the shell.

479
01:27:58,358 --> 01:28:00,109
Come on. Come on, go!

480
01:31:32,071 --> 01:31:35,408
<i>And so began the journey north to safety...</i>

481
01:31:36,075 --> 01:31:37,743
<i>...to our place in the sun.</i>

482
01:31:38,327 --> 01:31:42,331
<i>Among us we found a new leader,
the man who came from the sky...</i>

483
01:31:42,790 --> 01:31:44,458
<i>...the Gyro Captain.</i>

484
01:31:44,959 --> 01:31:47,253
<i>And just as Pappagallo had planned...</i>

485
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:50,756
<i>...we traveled far beyond
the reach of men on machines.</i>

486
01:31:51,632 --> 01:31:55,595
<i>The juice, the precious juice,
was hidden in the vehicles.</i>

487
01:31:57,346 --> 01:31:59,557
<i>As for me, I grew to manhood...</i>

488
01:32:00,224 --> 01:32:03,144
<i>...in the fullness of time,
I became the leader...</i>

489
01:32:03,311 --> 01:32:05,938
<i>...the chief of the Great Northern Tribe.</i>

490
01:32:07,857 --> 01:32:09,692
<i>And the Road Warrior?</i>

491
01:32:10,568 --> 01:32:13,196
<i>That was the last we ever saw of him.</i>

492
01:32:14,113 --> 01:32:18,284
<i>He lives now only in my memories.</i>
