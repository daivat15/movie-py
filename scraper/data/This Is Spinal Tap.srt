1
00:00:38,804 --> 00:00:42,390
Hello, my name is Marty
Di Bergi. I'm a filmmaker.

2
00:00:43,308 --> 00:00:45,184
I make a lot of commercials.

3
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:48,729
That little dog that chases the
covered wagon underneath the sink?

4
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:49,814
That was mine.

5
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:55,694
In 1966, I went down to
Greenwich Village, New York City,

6
00:00:55,779 --> 00:00:58,697
to a rock club called
The Electric Banana.

7
00:00:58,782 --> 00:01:01,075
Don't look for it,
it's not there anymore.

8
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:06,664
But that night, I heard a band that for
me redefined the word "rock 'n' roll."

9
00:01:07,582 --> 00:01:13,129
I remember being knocked out by
their exuberance, their raw power

10
00:01:13,213 --> 00:01:15,131
and their punctuality.

11
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:19,135
That band was Britain's
now legendary Spinal Tap.

12
00:01:20,387 --> 00:01:23,639
Seventeen years
and fifteen albums later,

13
00:01:23,723 --> 00:01:26,517
Spinal Tap is
still going strong.

14
00:01:26,893 --> 00:01:29,270
And they've earned a
distinguished place in rock history

15
00:01:29,354 --> 00:01:31,897
as one of
England's loudest bands.

16
00:01:32,816 --> 00:01:35,276
So, in the late fall of 1982,

17
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,530
when I heard that Tap was releasing
a new album called Smell the Glove,

18
00:01:39,614 --> 00:01:42,825
and was planning their first tour of
the United States in almost six years

19
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:44,285
to promote that album,

20
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:48,122
well, needless to say, I jumped at
the chance to make the documentary,

21
00:01:48,206 --> 00:01:52,209
the, if you will, rockumentary
that you are about to see.

22
00:01:53,003 --> 00:01:57,756
I wanted to capture the
sights, the sounds, the smells

23
00:01:58,508 --> 00:02:01,218
of a hard-working
rock band on the road.

24
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,220
And I got that.

25
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:05,431
But I got more.

26
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:07,308
A lot more.

27
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:10,102
But, hey,
enough of my yakking.

28
00:02:10,187 --> 00:02:11,896
What do you say?
Let's boogie.

29
00:02:21,823 --> 00:02:23,908
Gives me a lot of energy,
makes me happy.

30
00:02:23,992 --> 00:02:25,951
Heavy metal is deep.
You can get stuff out of it.

31
00:02:26,036 --> 00:02:27,995
The way they dress.
The leather.

32
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,830
Which one is this?
Is this LaGuardia...

33
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:31,665
No, this is JFK.

34
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,292
Oh, yes.
New York, New York.

35
00:02:37,923 --> 00:02:39,465
Watch it now.
Watch it now!

36
00:02:51,186 --> 00:02:53,771
It's like you become one
with the guys in the band.

37
00:02:53,855 --> 00:02:57,566
I mean, there's no division,
you just...

38
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:03,656
The music just unites
people with the players.

39
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:08,160
Come on and ride, direct
from hell, Spinal Tap!

40
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,663
You're hot
You take all we got

41
00:03:10,747 --> 00:03:13,290
Not a dry seat in the house

42
00:03:14,084 --> 00:03:16,168
Next day
We'll be on our way

43
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:18,420
But tonight I'm gonna rock you
Tonight I'm gonna rock you

44
00:03:18,505 --> 00:03:21,215
Yes, tonight I'm gonna rock
you Tonight I'm gonna rock you

45
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:22,508
Tonight!

46
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,848
We are Spinal Tap
from the UK!

47
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:32,101
You must be the USA!

48
00:04:00,422 --> 00:04:02,548
Little girl,
it's a great big world

49
00:04:02,632 --> 00:04:04,508
But there's only one of

50
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:11,098
Me!

51
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:30,909
Let's talk a little bit about
the history of the group.

52
00:04:30,994 --> 00:04:34,872
I understand, Nigel, you and
David originally started the band

53
00:04:34,956 --> 00:04:37,458
back in, when was it, 1964?

54
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:39,168
Before that, we were
in different groups.

55
00:04:39,252 --> 00:04:41,629
I was in a group called The
Creatures, which was a skiffle group.

56
00:04:41,713 --> 00:04:42,755
I was in Lovely Lads.

57
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,965
And then we
looked at each other

58
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,260
and said, well,
we might as well join up.

59
00:04:49,012 --> 00:04:51,180
So we became The Originals. Right.

60
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:53,891
And we had to change
our name, actually.

61
00:04:54,017 --> 00:04:56,727
Well, there was another group in
the East End called The Originals.

62
00:04:56,895 --> 00:04:59,146
You know, we had to
rename ourselves.

63
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,773
New Originals.
New Originals.

64
00:05:00,857 --> 00:05:03,067
And then they became...
The Regulars.

65
00:05:03,151 --> 00:05:04,652
They changed their name
back to The Regulars.

66
00:05:04,736 --> 00:05:08,238
We thought, well, we could go back to
The Originals, but what's the point?

67
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:10,699
Then we became The
Thamesmen at that point.

68
00:05:12,952 --> 00:05:14,495
Stop wasting my time

69
00:05:16,456 --> 00:05:18,248
You know what I want

70
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:21,585
You know what I need

71
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,130
Or maybe you don't

72
00:05:26,758 --> 00:05:31,428
Do I have to come right flat
out and tell you everything?

73
00:05:31,513 --> 00:05:34,264
Gimme some money

74
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:38,018
Gimme some money

75
00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:45,943
Your first drummer was...

76
00:05:46,027 --> 00:05:48,237
The Peeper.
John "Stumpy" Pepys.

77
00:05:48,321 --> 00:05:53,242
Great, great tall,
blonde geek with glasses.

78
00:05:54,411 --> 00:05:55,869
Good drummer. Great
look, good drummer, yeah.

79
00:05:55,954 --> 00:05:57,037
Good, good drummer.
Fine drummer.

80
00:05:57,122 --> 00:05:58,789
What happened to him?

81
00:05:58,873 --> 00:06:03,627
He died. He died in a bizarre
gardening accident some years back.

82
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:06,380
It's really one of
those things. It was...

83
00:06:06,464 --> 00:06:11,844
The authorities said best
leave it unsolved, really.

84
00:06:12,303 --> 00:06:14,054
And he was replaced by...

85
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:15,222
Stumpy Joe.

86
00:06:15,306 --> 00:06:16,974
Eric "Stumpy Joe" Childs.

87
00:06:17,058 --> 00:06:18,726
And what happened
to Stumpy Joe?

88
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,312
Well, it's not
a very pleasant story.

89
00:06:22,981 --> 00:06:24,898
He's passed on.
He died...

90
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:26,734
He choked on...

91
00:06:26,818 --> 00:06:30,988
The official explanation
was he choked on vomit.

92
00:06:31,906 --> 00:06:32,990
He passed away.

93
00:06:33,074 --> 00:06:35,826
It was actually
someone else's vomit.

94
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:36,952
It was ugly.

95
00:06:37,036 --> 00:06:38,620
You know,
there's no real...

96
00:06:38,705 --> 00:06:41,874
They can't prove whose vomit
it was. They don't have...

97
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:42,916
There's no prints.

98
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:44,084
...facilities
in Scotland Yard.

99
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:45,794
There's no way to print
a spectra-photograph.

100
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:46,920
You can't really
dust for vomit.

101
00:06:48,173 --> 00:06:49,965
Here we go.
Hello.

102
00:06:50,508 --> 00:06:52,426
SoHo, they call this. SoHo.

103
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,178
"So" what?
SoHo.

104
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,603
How are you?
Good to see you.

105
00:07:03,438 --> 00:07:08,066
Ian. Hi, fellas!
How are you doing?

106
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:09,443
Come over here.

107
00:07:09,527 --> 00:07:10,611
I want you to meet everybody.

108
00:07:10,695 --> 00:07:12,279
Bobbi Flekman.

109
00:07:12,363 --> 00:07:13,781
Who's that?
Bobbi Flekman.

110
00:07:13,865 --> 00:07:16,658
Viv! Come over here, everybody.
With the record company?

111
00:07:16,743 --> 00:07:18,327
So... Yes, Bobbi Flekman.

112
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:19,703
Bobbi, of course,
how are you?

113
00:07:19,788 --> 00:07:20,871
The hostess with
the mostess.

114
00:07:20,955 --> 00:07:21,955
We know, we know.

115
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,207
You know, you know.

116
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,293
Hi, handsome,
how are you doing?

117
00:07:26,377 --> 00:07:29,254
All right, listen, I want you
to all meet Sir Denis Eton-Hogg.

118
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,089
Now, he's the head of Polymer. We know.

119
00:07:31,174 --> 00:07:33,300
You, don't talk so much,
just smile a little. Smile.

120
00:07:33,384 --> 00:07:34,426
Oh,
she knows...

121
00:07:34,511 --> 00:07:36,929
Denis, come here!
Come here.

122
00:07:37,013 --> 00:07:39,848
I want you to meet Spinal Tap.
They're our guests of honor.

123
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:40,974
How very nice to meet you.

124
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:42,810
Kids, this is
Sir Denis Eton-Hogg.

125
00:07:42,894 --> 00:07:44,019
This is Nigel.

126
00:07:44,103 --> 00:07:45,103
Yeah, this is Nigel.
Hi.

127
00:07:45,188 --> 00:07:47,439
Thanks a lot
for letting us...

128
00:07:48,107 --> 00:07:50,901
Let's go over here, and we'll
all take a picture together.

129
00:07:50,985 --> 00:07:53,529
Where's Christine?
Where's my photographer?

130
00:07:53,613 --> 00:07:56,156
Come over here, honey.
What's your name? Christine?

131
00:07:56,866 --> 00:07:58,742
Okay, right over here.

132
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:01,203
Good. Good!

133
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:02,538
He's not into negro music.

134
00:08:02,622 --> 00:08:04,915
No, no, I don't
eat that shit.

135
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,960
Guys, you look great.
I mean, you look fantastic.

136
00:08:08,044 --> 00:08:09,711
You would never know
you were almost 40.

137
00:08:09,796 --> 00:08:11,004
I mean,
if I looked this good...

138
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:13,090
And from the stage, too,
it's amazing.

139
00:08:13,174 --> 00:08:14,925
I did the Bird.
Do the Dead Bird.

140
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:16,635
Change this, get the dwarf
cannolis, the little ones.

141
00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:19,012
All right. I did the Bird.
Come on! Don't talk back.

142
00:08:19,097 --> 00:08:20,806
Mime is money. Let's go!
Come on, move it!

143
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:23,684
Now, we here at Polymer,
we're all looking forward

144
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:28,063
to a long and fruitful
relationship with Spinal Tap.

145
00:08:28,314 --> 00:08:32,401
We wish them great success
on their North American tour.

146
00:08:32,485 --> 00:08:37,364
And so say all of us,
"Tap into America!"

147
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:45,789
Excuse me,
are you reading Yes I Can?

148
00:08:46,457 --> 00:08:47,708
Yeah, have you read it?

149
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:49,209
Yeah, by Sammy Davis Jr?

150
00:08:49,294 --> 00:08:50,294
Yeah.

151
00:08:50,378 --> 00:08:53,130
You know what the title
of that book should be?

152
00:08:53,214 --> 00:08:56,049
Yes, I Can, if Frank
Sinatra Says It's Okay.

153
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,053
'Cause Frank calls the
shots for all those guys.

154
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:03,891
Did you get to the part yet where
Sammy's coming out of the Copa,

155
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:08,145
and it's about 3:00 in the
morning, and he sees Frank?

156
00:09:08,229 --> 00:09:11,064
Frank's walking down
Broadway by himself...

157
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:15,193
Fucking limeys.

158
00:09:15,987 --> 00:09:17,571
Well, they're not
used to that world.

159
00:09:17,655 --> 00:09:18,864
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I know.

160
00:09:18,948 --> 00:09:21,617
Frank Sinatra. It's a
different world that they're in.

161
00:09:21,701 --> 00:09:24,453
It's just,
people like this,

162
00:09:25,788 --> 00:09:26,872
they get all they want,

163
00:09:26,956 --> 00:09:30,375
so they don't really understand
about a life like Frank's.

164
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,004
I mean, when you've loved
and lost the way Frank has,

165
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,214
then you know
what life's about.

166
00:09:36,341 --> 00:09:38,258
The Times may even do
- Really?

167
00:09:38,343 --> 00:09:40,427
The New York Times?
The New York Times.

168
00:09:40,511 --> 00:09:43,305
The bump we've got to iron out here
is when do we get the album released?

169
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:45,807
I mean, it doesn't matter how good
the press is or what the stringers...

170
00:09:45,892 --> 00:09:47,601
As I explained
last night,

171
00:09:47,685 --> 00:09:50,771
we're not gonna saturate
the New York market.

172
00:09:50,855 --> 00:09:53,023
Now, Philly, now that's
a real rock 'n' roll town.

173
00:09:53,107 --> 00:09:54,274
Oh,
Philly's a great town.

174
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:56,568
Be assured that the
album will be available

175
00:09:56,653 --> 00:09:59,112
all through the Philadelphia
metropolitan area.

176
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:00,614
So you are
hitting that market.

177
00:10:00,698 --> 00:10:03,617
We're certainly doing...

178
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:05,953
I'm doing everything I can.

179
00:10:06,037 --> 00:10:07,287
You know that
we're not blaming you.

180
00:10:07,372 --> 00:10:09,790
But you don't feel that these
guys have an effect on an audience.

181
00:10:09,874 --> 00:10:12,709
I mean, kids go to their
concert, they have a great time...

182
00:10:12,794 --> 00:10:16,088
But it's a passing thing.
It's...

183
00:10:17,382 --> 00:10:22,386
I mean, I would never tell
them this, but this is a fad.

184
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:48,245
The bigger the
cushion, the sweeter the pushin'

185
00:10:48,746 --> 00:10:50,747
That's what I said

186
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:56,670
The looser the waistband,
the deeper the quicksand

187
00:10:56,754 --> 00:10:59,006
Or so I have read

188
00:11:01,384 --> 00:11:05,846
My baby fits me
like a flesh tuxedo

189
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,433
I like to sink her
with my pink torpedo

190
00:11:10,476 --> 00:11:13,979
Big bottom, big bottom

191
00:11:14,063 --> 00:11:18,066
Talk about bum cakes,
my girl's got 'em

192
00:11:18,776 --> 00:11:22,112
Big bottom,
drive me out of my mind

193
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,991
How could I leave this behind?

194
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:35,042
I met her on Monday

195
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:37,210
It was my lucky bun day

196
00:11:37,295 --> 00:11:39,629
You know what I mean

197
00:11:41,424 --> 00:11:43,383
I love her each weekday

198
00:11:43,468 --> 00:11:45,844
Each velvety cheek day

199
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,346
You know what I mean

200
00:11:50,391 --> 00:11:54,186
My love gun's loaded
and she's in my sights

201
00:11:54,645 --> 00:11:58,607
Big game is waiting there
inside her tights, yeah!

202
00:11:58,983 --> 00:12:02,569
Big bottom, big bottom

203
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,740
Talk about mud flaps,
my girl's got 'em

204
00:12:07,533 --> 00:12:10,619
Big bottom,
drive me out of my mind

205
00:12:11,162 --> 00:12:14,831
How could I leave this behind?

206
00:12:23,132 --> 00:12:25,675
Let's talk about your
reviews a little bit.

207
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,302
Regarding
Intravenus de Milo,

208
00:12:27,386 --> 00:12:29,888
"This tasteless cover
is a good indication

209
00:12:29,972 --> 00:12:32,474
"of the lack of
musical invention within.

210
00:12:32,558 --> 00:12:36,019
"The musical growth rate of
this band cannot even be charted.

211
00:12:36,104 --> 00:12:40,107
"They're treading water in a sea of
retarded sexuality and bad poetry."

212
00:12:40,191 --> 00:12:41,650
That's nitpicking,
isn't it?

213
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:44,069
The Gospel
According To Spinal Tap.

214
00:12:44,153 --> 00:12:47,447
"This pretentious, ponderous
collection of religious rock psalms

215
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:49,825
"is enough to prompt
the question,

216
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:52,869
"'What day did
the Lord create Spinal Tap,

217
00:12:52,954 --> 00:12:55,872
"'and couldn't he have
rested on that day, too?"'

218
00:12:55,957 --> 00:12:58,917
I never heard that one. That's
a good one. That's a good one.

219
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:00,335
The review you had
on Shark Sandwich,

220
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:03,463
which was merely
a two-word review,

221
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:05,924
it just said,
"Shit sandwich."

222
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,136
Where'd they print
that? Who printed that?

223
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,887
That's not real, is it?
- You can't print that.

224
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:15,016
You know, all those arguments
about touring or not touring,

225
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:17,477
and all that, I mean, it's
obvious, we belong on tour.

226
00:13:17,562 --> 00:13:19,563
You know, it's a great idea.
- I couldn't agree more.

227
00:13:19,647 --> 00:13:20,814
You know all that stuff
about you being too old

228
00:13:20,898 --> 00:13:22,023
and you being too white...
- Yeah.

229
00:13:22,108 --> 00:13:24,317
But what about
the album, Ian?

230
00:13:24,402 --> 00:13:25,443
Well, that's
the real problem...

231
00:13:25,528 --> 00:13:26,945
There's beginning
to be a refrain here.

232
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:29,322
You know, there's no way to promote
something that doesn't exist,

233
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:30,782
you know?

234
00:13:30,867 --> 00:13:32,325
It's a very
unimportant reason.

235
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,245
It's just that they're just
experimenting with a...

236
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:37,080
With some new
packaging materials.

237
00:13:37,248 --> 00:13:38,456
Right, let me get the door.

238
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,500
What kind of experimenting? They
got monkeys opening it or what?

239
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:43,670
The other thing is that the
Boston gig has been canceled.

240
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:44,754
What?
Yeah.

241
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:47,340
I wouldn't worry about it, though,
it's not a big college town.

242
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:53,138
Hey, I heard you boys had an
album coming out right now?

243
00:13:53,222 --> 00:13:55,640
Yeah, it's Smell the
Glove. It should be out now...

244
00:13:55,725 --> 00:13:57,893
Smell the Glove?
Smell the Glove, yeah.

245
00:13:57,977 --> 00:14:00,395
It's a provocative title.
I love it.

246
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:02,063
Wait till you see the cover,
wait till you see the cover.

247
00:14:02,148 --> 00:14:03,607
Very provocative indeed.

248
00:14:03,691 --> 00:14:06,568
Bobbi, can I tear
you away from all this?

249
00:14:08,196 --> 00:14:09,196
Do you have a drink?

250
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,072
No, I don't...
I don't really need one.

251
00:14:11,157 --> 00:14:13,700
But, listen, I really do
have to talk to you a bit

252
00:14:13,784 --> 00:14:15,035
about this whole
issue of the...

253
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:17,204
Ian, just tell me
whatever's on your mind.

254
00:14:17,288 --> 00:14:18,830
The issue of the cover.

255
00:14:18,915 --> 00:14:20,665
Yeah?
Um...

256
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:24,836
We... I mean, we feel,
and it seems to be facts,

257
00:14:25,171 --> 00:14:27,339
that the company is rather down
on the cover. Is that the case?

258
00:14:27,465 --> 00:14:29,424
Yes. You can give it to
me straight, you know.

259
00:14:29,508 --> 00:14:31,551
Listen, they don't
like the cover.

260
00:14:31,636 --> 00:14:33,136
They don't like the cover.
That's certainly straight.

261
00:14:33,221 --> 00:14:35,805
They find it very offensive
and very sexist.

262
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,432
Well, what exactly
do you find offensive?

263
00:14:37,558 --> 00:14:41,728
Ian, you put a greased, naked
woman... I mean, what's offensive?

264
00:14:41,854 --> 00:14:43,146
...on all fours...
Yes.

265
00:14:43,272 --> 00:14:45,232
...with a dog collar around
her neck... With a dog collar.

266
00:14:45,316 --> 00:14:46,816
...and a leash...
And a leash.

267
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:48,818
...and a man's arm,
extended out,

268
00:14:48,903 --> 00:14:51,154
up to here,
holding on to the leash

269
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:54,991
and pushing a black glove
in her face to sniff it.

270
00:14:55,117 --> 00:14:56,743
You don't find that
offensive? No, I don't.

271
00:14:56,827 --> 00:14:57,911
You don't find that sexist?

272
00:14:57,995 --> 00:14:59,371
This is 1982, Bobbi,
come on.

273
00:14:59,455 --> 00:15:01,748
That's right, it's 1982.
Get out of the '60s.

274
00:15:01,832 --> 00:15:04,125
We don't have this mentality
anymore. Listen to me.

275
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,627
Well, you should've seen
the cover they wanted to do.

276
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,087
I don't care... It wasn't
a glove, believe me.

277
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:08,171
See, now this is
something, Ian,

278
00:15:08,256 --> 00:15:09,881
that you're going to have
to talk to your boys about.

279
00:15:09,966 --> 00:15:11,466
We're certainly not
laying down any conditions.

280
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,093
And I don't think
a sexy cover is the answer

281
00:15:13,177 --> 00:15:14,761
for why an album sells
or doesn't sell.

282
00:15:14,845 --> 00:15:18,098
Because, you tell me, The
White Album, what was that?

283
00:15:18,182 --> 00:15:19,683
There was nothing on
that goddamn cover.

284
00:15:20,851 --> 00:15:22,352
Excuse me, the phone's ringing. Sure.

285
00:15:22,436 --> 00:15:23,603
Ian, we'll talk
about this after.

286
00:15:23,688 --> 00:15:24,771
Okay, right, love.

287
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:26,147
Hello?

288
00:15:26,274 --> 00:15:27,649
Hi, Denis.

289
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:29,901
Uh-oh.

290
00:15:29,986 --> 00:15:32,320
Okay. Why don't you tell him?

291
00:15:32,697 --> 00:15:34,239
Okay, hold on one minute.

292
00:15:34,323 --> 00:15:35,407
Ian?

293
00:15:35,574 --> 00:15:37,450
It's Eaton-Hogg.
He wants to talk to you.

294
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:38,535
Okay. Thank you, darling.

295
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:40,412
You're welcome, dear.

296
00:15:41,831 --> 00:15:43,665
Hello, Sir Denis?

297
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,542
Hi, how are you?

298
00:15:48,587 --> 00:15:49,713
Oh!

299
00:15:51,132 --> 00:15:52,882
Fucking old poofter!

300
00:15:53,968 --> 00:15:57,470
But it's really not that
offensive, Sir Denis, come on.

301
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:02,225
Okay. I'll call you absolutely
first thing in the morning.

302
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,603
Oh, shit!

303
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,315
They're not going
to release the album,

304
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,568
because they have decided
that the cover is sexist.

305
00:16:12,236 --> 00:16:13,611
- Well, so what?
- Yeah.

306
00:16:13,696 --> 00:16:15,655
What's wrong with being sexy?
I mean, there's no...

307
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,324
Sexist!
"Ist."

308
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,326
They wanted sexy. Okay, listen,
I wanted to tell you this,

309
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,910
and I was holding back,

310
00:16:20,995 --> 00:16:23,496
because I didn't know what
Denis' decision was going to be.

311
00:16:23,581 --> 00:16:26,333
But, at this point, both
Sears and Kmart stores have

312
00:16:26,417 --> 00:16:27,917
refused to
handle the album.

313
00:16:28,002 --> 00:16:30,628
They're boycotting the album
only because of the cover.

314
00:16:30,713 --> 00:16:31,713
If the first album
was a hit...

315
00:16:31,797 --> 00:16:32,797
If a company's
behind an album,

316
00:16:32,882 --> 00:16:34,924
it can shove it
right down their throats.

317
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:37,427
Money talks and
bullshit walks.

318
00:16:37,511 --> 00:16:39,304
And if the first
album was a hit,

319
00:16:39,388 --> 00:16:40,680
then we could've
pressed on them,

320
00:16:40,765 --> 00:16:42,015
then we could've told them,

321
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:43,475
"Yes, let's..."
The music, every cut,

322
00:16:43,601 --> 00:16:45,518
on this album is a hit. I don't
give a shit what the album...

323
00:16:45,603 --> 00:16:47,562
It's a matter of
compromise. It was a joke.

324
00:16:47,646 --> 00:16:49,773
And they're making it a big deal.
Yeah, that's it. That's true.

325
00:16:49,857 --> 00:16:51,066
You know, if we were
serious, and we said,

326
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,027
"Yes, she should be forced
to smell the glove,"

327
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:56,696
then you'd have a point, you know,
but it's all a joke, isn't it?

328
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:58,698
I mean, it's making fun...
Well, it is and it isn't.

329
00:16:58,783 --> 00:16:59,866
We're making fun of
that sort of thing.

330
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,368
She should be made
to smell it, you know?

331
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:03,370
Not, you know, over
and over again, of course.

332
00:17:03,454 --> 00:17:05,205
Listen, the thing is, we can
probably work something out.

333
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:08,041
I'll talk to Denis and maybe we
can come up with a compromise.

334
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,543
A new design concept
that we can all live with.

335
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:11,920
You guys were schoolmates?

336
00:17:12,004 --> 00:17:15,924
We don't... We're not
university material.

337
00:17:16,008 --> 00:17:17,842
What's that on your finger?
It's my gum.

338
00:17:17,927 --> 00:17:19,177
What are you doing
with it on your finger?

339
00:17:19,261 --> 00:17:21,054
I might need it later.

340
00:17:21,138 --> 00:17:23,640
Put it on the table,
that's terrible.

341
00:17:23,724 --> 00:17:25,350
I might forget
it on the table.

342
00:17:25,476 --> 00:17:28,144
How old were you guys when you
met? I can't take him anywhere.

343
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,564
About eight years old.
Eight or nine.

344
00:17:31,649 --> 00:17:34,317
You were eight
and I was seven.

345
00:17:34,402 --> 00:17:35,485
That's right, yeah.

346
00:17:35,569 --> 00:17:39,489
Do you remember the first song
that you guys ever wrote together?

347
00:17:39,573 --> 00:17:41,408
All The Way Home,
probably.

348
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:42,450
Yeah.
All The Way Home?

349
00:17:42,535 --> 00:17:45,245
Yeah. Can you remember
a little bit of it?

350
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:47,664
I'd love to hear it.
Christ.

351
00:17:47,748 --> 00:17:49,249
With some black coffee
maybe we could do it.

352
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,583
How does it go?

353
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:55,213
I was standing
there beside the railroad track

354
00:17:56,507 --> 00:17:59,676
And I'm waiting for that
train to bring you back

355
00:17:59,885 --> 00:18:01,344
Bring you back

356
00:18:03,347 --> 00:18:09,185
If she's not on the 5:19, then
I'm gonna know what sorrow means

357
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,981
And I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
All the way home

358
00:18:13,858 --> 00:18:16,234
All the way home

359
00:18:16,318 --> 00:18:18,695
All the way home
All the way home

360
00:18:20,322 --> 00:18:22,615
Cry, cry, cry
all the way home...

361
00:18:23,033 --> 00:18:25,827
It's fairly simple. It's about six
words in the whole song, you know.

362
00:18:25,953 --> 00:18:27,620
We just repeat them over
and over again. Yeah.

363
00:18:27,705 --> 00:18:29,664
Let's talk about
your music today.

364
00:18:29,748 --> 00:18:34,836
One thing that puzzles me is
the make-up of your audience

365
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,132
seems to be, predominantly,
young boys.

366
00:18:39,925 --> 00:18:41,634
Well, it's
a sexual thing, really.

367
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:44,471
Aside from the identifying
that boys do with us,

368
00:18:44,555 --> 00:18:47,599
there's also like
a reaction to the female...

369
00:18:47,683 --> 00:18:49,350
Of the female to our music.

370
00:18:49,435 --> 00:18:50,518
What was the way... Yeah.

371
00:18:50,603 --> 00:18:51,936
Really, they're
quite fearful.

372
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:53,021
That's my theory.

373
00:18:53,105 --> 00:18:55,857
They see us on stage,
with tight trousers.

374
00:18:55,941 --> 00:18:58,568
We've got, you know,
armadillos in our trousers.

375
00:18:58,652 --> 00:19:00,820
I mean, it's really quite
frightening, the size.

376
00:19:00,905 --> 00:19:02,280
Yeah.

377
00:19:02,364 --> 00:19:03,656
And they run screaming.

378
00:19:08,787 --> 00:19:10,872
Ian, can I have a word
with you for a minute?

379
00:19:10,956 --> 00:19:12,165
Yes, of course.

380
00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:15,168
Listen, we have problems...

381
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:16,377
What?

382
00:19:16,462 --> 00:19:18,505
...with the arrangements
backstage.

383
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:20,840
What exactly?
What, I mean...

384
00:19:20,925 --> 00:19:22,592
Well, no, there's
some problems here.

385
00:19:22,676 --> 00:19:23,843
I don't even know
where to start.

386
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:26,721
All right, this... No,
no, no. Sound check? What?

387
00:19:26,805 --> 00:19:30,099
This, this... Look, there's
a little problem with the...

388
00:19:30,184 --> 00:19:32,018
Look, this miniature bread,

389
00:19:32,102 --> 00:19:36,147
it's, like, I've been working with
this now for about half an hour.

390
00:19:36,232 --> 00:19:39,526
I can't figure out... Let's
say I want a bite, right?

391
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,027
I got this...
You'd like bigger bread?

392
00:19:41,111 --> 00:19:42,654
Exactly. I don't
understand how...

393
00:19:42,738 --> 00:19:44,155
You could just
fold this, though.

394
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:46,324
Well, no, then it's half the
size. I mean, you could fold it.

395
00:19:46,408 --> 00:19:48,201
No, not the bread.
You just fold the meat.

396
00:19:48,285 --> 00:19:50,036
Yeah, but then
it breaks apart.

397
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,120
No, no, no.

398
00:19:51,205 --> 00:19:52,747
You put it on the bread
like this, see?

399
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:55,166
But then if you keep folding
it, it keeps breaking...

400
00:19:55,251 --> 00:19:56,751
But why would you
keep folding it?

401
00:19:56,835 --> 00:20:00,213
...and everything has to be
folded, and then it's this.

402
00:20:00,297 --> 00:20:03,132
And I don't want this,
I want large bread,

403
00:20:03,217 --> 00:20:05,009
so that I can put this...

404
00:20:05,094 --> 00:20:06,219
Right.

405
00:20:06,303 --> 00:20:08,846
...so then it's like this.
But this doesn't work,

406
00:20:08,931 --> 00:20:10,348
because then it's all...

407
00:20:10,432 --> 00:20:11,766
Because it hangs out
like that.

408
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,893
Look, would you be
holding this?

409
00:20:13,978 --> 00:20:15,728
No, I wouldn't want to
put that in my mouth.

410
00:20:15,813 --> 00:20:17,939
All right, A. Exhibit A.
No, you're right.

411
00:20:18,023 --> 00:20:21,526
And then we move onto this.
Look. Who's in here? No one.

412
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,237
And then in here,
there's a little guy. Look.

413
00:20:24,321 --> 00:20:25,822
So it's a complete
catastrophe!

414
00:20:25,906 --> 00:20:27,031
No, you're right.
Nigel, Nigel...

415
00:20:27,116 --> 00:20:28,700
But calm down. Calm down.

416
00:20:28,784 --> 00:20:29,909
Calm... No, it's no big deal.

417
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:31,494
It's a joke, really.
I'm sorry.

418
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:33,913
It's just some cracker
university, you know?

419
00:20:33,998 --> 00:20:35,290
No, it's a joke.
No, I really...

420
00:20:35,374 --> 00:20:36,916
I don't want it to affect
your performance. All right?

421
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:38,793
It's not going to
affect my performance.

422
00:20:38,877 --> 00:20:40,628
Don't worry about it,
all right?

423
00:20:40,713 --> 00:20:41,754
I just hate it, really.

424
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,006
It does disturb me.
It won't happen again.

425
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,174
But I'll rise above it,
I'm a professional.

426
00:20:50,514 --> 00:20:53,391
It's better in a hell hole

427
00:20:53,475 --> 00:20:57,520
You know where you
stand in a hell hole

428
00:20:57,605 --> 00:21:01,816
Folks lend a hand
in a hell hole

429
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:06,279
Girl, get me back
to my hell hole

430
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:01,959
Do Stonehenge!

431
00:22:02,461 --> 00:22:05,129
Do you actually
play all these, or...

432
00:22:06,048 --> 00:22:08,341
Well, I play them
and I cherish them.

433
00:22:08,425 --> 00:22:11,177
This is at the top of the heap, right
here. There's no question about it.

434
00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:14,639
Look at the flame on that
one. I mean, it's just...

435
00:22:14,723 --> 00:22:16,516
It's quite unbelievable.

436
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:22,563
This one is just perfect.
1959, you cannot...

437
00:22:22,648 --> 00:22:25,400
How much... Listen,
just listen for a minute.

438
00:22:25,484 --> 00:22:26,776
The sustain, listen to it.

439
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,444
I'm not hearing anything.

440
00:22:29,238 --> 00:22:30,863
You would, though,
if it were playing,

441
00:22:30,948 --> 00:22:33,783
because it really is
famous for its sustain.

442
00:22:33,867 --> 00:22:35,034
You can just hold it...

443
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,285
So you'd have to play...

444
00:22:37,496 --> 00:22:38,913
You can go and
have a bite and...

445
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,499
You'd still be
hearing that one.

446
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:43,209
Can you hold this a sec?
Sure.

447
00:22:43,293 --> 00:22:47,338
This one... This, of course,
is a custom three-pickup Paul.

448
00:22:47,631 --> 00:22:49,590
This is my radio unit.

449
00:22:49,675 --> 00:22:54,595
So I strap this piece on, right
down in here when I'm on stage.

450
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,848
It's a wireless.
Wireless, exactly.

451
00:22:57,266 --> 00:22:59,475
And I can play without
all the mucky-muck.

452
00:22:59,601 --> 00:23:01,227
You can run anywhere on
stage with that. Exactly.

453
00:23:01,311 --> 00:23:04,397
Now, this is special, too.
Look. See?

454
00:23:04,481 --> 00:23:07,567
Still got the old tagger on
it, see? Never even played it.

455
00:23:07,651 --> 00:23:08,985
You just bought it?
Don't touch it!

456
00:23:09,069 --> 00:23:11,028
Don't touch it. No one...
I wasn't gonna touch it.

457
00:23:11,113 --> 00:23:12,905
No. Don't touch it.
I was just pointing at it.

458
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,991
Well, don't point, even.
Don't even point?

459
00:23:15,075 --> 00:23:17,493
No. It can't be
played. Never.

460
00:23:17,578 --> 00:23:18,870
Can I look at it?

461
00:23:18,954 --> 00:23:20,413
No, you've seen
enough of that one.

462
00:23:20,497 --> 00:23:24,459
This is a top to what we use
on stage, but it's very special,

463
00:23:24,543 --> 00:23:26,753
because if you can see...
Yeah.

464
00:23:26,837 --> 00:23:29,881
...the numbers all go to 11.

465
00:23:29,965 --> 00:23:33,342
Look, right across
the board, 11, 11, 11...

466
00:23:33,427 --> 00:23:35,553
And most of these
amps go up to 10.

467
00:23:35,637 --> 00:23:36,637
Exactly.

468
00:23:36,722 --> 00:23:39,098
Does that mean it's louder?
Is it any louder?

469
00:23:39,183 --> 00:23:42,351
Well, it's one louder,
isn't it? It's not 10.

470
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:45,396
You see, most blokes
will be playing at 10.

471
00:23:45,481 --> 00:23:48,649
You're on 10 here, all
the way up, all the way up,

472
00:23:48,734 --> 00:23:52,695
you're on 10 on your guitar,
where can you go from there? Where?

473
00:23:52,905 --> 00:23:54,530
I don't know.
Nowhere. Exactly!

474
00:23:54,615 --> 00:23:56,532
What we do is,
if we need that

475
00:23:56,617 --> 00:23:59,410
extra push over the cliff,
you know what we do?

476
00:23:59,495 --> 00:24:01,871
Put it up to 11.
11! Exactly. One louder.

477
00:24:01,955 --> 00:24:05,625
Why don't you just make 10 louder,
and make 10 be the top number,

478
00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:07,919
and make that
a little louder?

479
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,506
These go to 11.

480
00:24:12,216 --> 00:24:13,841
Are you Spinal Tap?

481
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:14,967
Spinal Tap?
This is Spinal Tap.

482
00:24:15,052 --> 00:24:16,636
Tap, tap, tap, tap.
Welcome to Memphis, gentlemen.

483
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,514
We have a slight problem with your
reservation. Nothing serious, I'm afraid.

484
00:24:19,598 --> 00:24:20,598
How slight?

485
00:24:20,682 --> 00:24:22,308
You wanted
seven suites, yes.

486
00:24:22,392 --> 00:24:23,392
Seven suites.

487
00:24:23,477 --> 00:24:26,646
He mistakenly put you on the
seventh floor, with one suite.

488
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,981
That's considerably
more than minor.

489
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:32,985
But it's a good size room, sir, it's
a King Leisure. We can get you...

490
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:36,489
How are we gonna get 14 people
in a King Leisure bed, Tucker?

491
00:24:36,573 --> 00:24:38,491
Don't tempt me, sir. Have a
good time, will you? Take care.

492
00:24:38,575 --> 00:24:39,617
I'll take care of it.

493
00:24:39,701 --> 00:24:41,994
You're welcome, gentlemen. And
very attractive, they are, too.

494
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:43,538
Listen to me!
Yes, sir.

495
00:24:43,622 --> 00:24:45,540
We want these suites, and
we want them now, okay?

496
00:24:45,624 --> 00:24:46,958
These people are tired.
Yes, we can help you.

497
00:24:47,084 --> 00:24:49,001
We have sound check in an hour.
Reba! Perhaps you can help us.

498
00:24:49,086 --> 00:24:50,419
What's the problem, sir?
Give me a hand, please.

499
00:24:50,504 --> 00:24:52,088
What's the matter? I'll
tell you what's wrong, okay?

500
00:24:52,172 --> 00:24:55,049
This twisted old
fruit here tells me

501
00:24:55,133 --> 00:24:56,676
that you have not
got my reservations.

502
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,844
I'm just as God made me, sir.

503
00:24:57,928 --> 00:25:00,137
What's the difference between
golf and miniature golf?

504
00:25:00,222 --> 00:25:01,931
I think the balls...
The holes are smaller.

505
00:25:02,015 --> 00:25:04,183
Uh-oh! Look out,
here they come.

506
00:25:04,268 --> 00:25:05,685
Duke, Duke!

507
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:08,521
Can I have your autograph?

508
00:25:08,605 --> 00:25:09,689
It's Duke Fame!
It's Duke Fame.

509
00:25:09,773 --> 00:25:11,691
Duke! Duke.

510
00:25:11,775 --> 00:25:13,401
It's okay, we know him.
Spinal Tap.

511
00:25:13,485 --> 00:25:15,862
David St. Hubbins,
Spinal Tap.

512
00:25:15,946 --> 00:25:17,822
Derek Smalls, Spinal Tap.
Nigel...

513
00:25:17,906 --> 00:25:18,906
We gotta get going...

514
00:25:18,991 --> 00:25:20,324
Listen, where are
you playing in town?

515
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:22,326
You playing here?
We're doing the...

516
00:25:22,411 --> 00:25:24,203
Enormodome, whatever
it is, it's terrific.

517
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:25,997
Yeah, big place, outside of
town. Sold it out. Very nice.

518
00:25:26,081 --> 00:25:27,373
That's a big place.
You sold it out?

519
00:25:27,457 --> 00:25:28,666
What's that?
20,000 seats?

520
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,543
We really should run,
you know...

521
00:25:30,627 --> 00:25:33,254
Good heavens!
How are you, Laddy?

522
00:25:33,338 --> 00:25:35,006
Great to see you, Ter.

523
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,757
Terrific to see you.
Liam!

524
00:25:36,842 --> 00:25:38,634
Ian. Ian.
Ian, yeah.

525
00:25:39,011 --> 00:25:40,803
Listen, we'd love to
stand around and chat,

526
00:25:40,888 --> 00:25:43,389
but we gotta sit down in the
lobby and wait for the limo.

527
00:25:43,473 --> 00:25:45,516
Okay. Duke, great to see you.
Catch up with you on the road.

528
00:25:45,642 --> 00:25:47,268
Great to see you again,
Terry. Yeah, cheers!

529
00:25:47,352 --> 00:25:48,352
Best of luck.
- Duke!

530
00:25:48,437 --> 00:25:49,437
We'll catch up
at your house, maybe.

531
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:51,480
Great! Great!
Great to see you.

532
00:25:51,565 --> 00:25:53,357
See you. See you, Duke.
Good days, good days.

533
00:25:54,776 --> 00:25:56,402
Wanker.
- What a wanker.

534
00:25:56,486 --> 00:25:57,612
What a wanker.
- No-talent sod.

535
00:25:57,696 --> 00:25:59,989
He's got this much talent.
This much, if he's lucky.

536
00:26:00,073 --> 00:26:01,115
We carried him.

537
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:02,742
We had to apologize
for him with our set.

538
00:26:02,826 --> 00:26:03,868
That's right.

539
00:26:03,952 --> 00:26:05,953
People were still
booing him when we went on.

540
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:07,747
It's all bull.
It's all hype.

541
00:26:07,831 --> 00:26:10,041
We got our rooms.
Big fat suites.

542
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:11,250
Can I ask you something?

543
00:26:11,335 --> 00:26:14,128
Have you seen Duke Fame's
current album?

544
00:26:14,922 --> 00:26:16,297
Um... Yes, yes.

545
00:26:16,381 --> 00:26:17,965
Have you seen the cover?

546
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,258
No, I don't think I have.

547
00:26:19,343 --> 00:26:20,426
It's a rather lurid cover.

548
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:23,012
I mean, it's like
naked women, and...

549
00:26:23,096 --> 00:26:26,557
He's tied down to this table,
and they've got these whips,

550
00:26:26,683 --> 00:26:29,018
and they're all
semi-nude... Knocking on him.

551
00:26:29,102 --> 00:26:30,603
And it's like... It's much
worse... What's the point?

552
00:26:30,687 --> 00:26:32,605
Well, the point is that it's
much worse than Smell the Glove.

553
00:26:32,689 --> 00:26:35,149
He releases that,
and he's number three!

554
00:26:35,233 --> 00:26:36,525
Because he's the victim.

555
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,903
Their objections were that
she was the victim, you see.

556
00:26:38,987 --> 00:26:39,987
Oh.
Oh.

557
00:26:40,072 --> 00:26:42,782
That's all right. If the singer's the
victim, it's different. It's not sexist.

558
00:26:42,866 --> 00:26:43,908
He did a twist on it.

559
00:26:43,992 --> 00:26:45,159
He did,
he turned it around.

560
00:26:45,285 --> 00:26:46,869
We should have thought
of that. We were so close.

561
00:26:46,954 --> 00:26:49,914
If we had all you guys tied up,
that probably would have been fine.

562
00:26:49,998 --> 00:26:51,415
But it's still
a stupid cover.

563
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,335
It's such a fine line
between stupid and clever.

564
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:56,170
Yeah, just that
little turnabout.

565
00:26:56,254 --> 00:26:58,422
I have a small
piece of bad news.

566
00:26:58,548 --> 00:27:00,007
Although, it may not be that
- For a change.

567
00:27:00,092 --> 00:27:02,051
We're canceled here.

568
00:27:02,886 --> 00:27:03,886
At the hotel?

569
00:27:03,971 --> 00:27:06,389
No, we're canceled.
The gig is canceled.

570
00:27:06,556 --> 00:27:07,682
Fuck.

571
00:27:08,308 --> 00:27:12,520
It says, "Memphis show canceled
due to lack of advertising funds."

572
00:27:13,105 --> 00:27:15,815
The last time
Tap toured America,

573
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:21,112
they were booked into 10,000-seat
arenas and 15,000-seat venues.

574
00:27:21,697 --> 00:27:24,281
And it seems that now,
on the current tour,

575
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:29,161
they're being booked into
1,200-seat arenas, 1,500-seat arenas,

576
00:27:29,413 --> 00:27:33,290
and I was just wondering, does this mean
the popularity of the group is waning?

577
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:35,501
Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no.

578
00:27:36,253 --> 00:27:39,296
No, not at all.
I just think that

579
00:27:39,381 --> 00:27:41,716
their appeal is
becoming more selective.

580
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,800
Ah.

581
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,720
Now, I notice this here, you
got this cricket bat here.

582
00:27:45,846 --> 00:27:47,096
Yes.
Do you play?

583
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,765
No, I carry this
partly out of...

584
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,892
I don't know, sort of...

585
00:27:54,187 --> 00:27:55,396
I suppose,
what's the word?

586
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,522
Affectation?

587
00:27:56,606 --> 00:28:00,192
Yes, I mean, it's a kind of
totemistic thing, you know?

588
00:28:00,277 --> 00:28:02,194
But, to be quite frank
with you,

589
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:04,030
it's come in useful
on a couple situations.

590
00:28:04,197 --> 00:28:07,366
Certainly, in the topsy-turvy
world of heavy rock,

591
00:28:07,451 --> 00:28:11,620
having a good solid piece of wood
in your hand is quite often useful.

592
00:28:12,497 --> 00:28:14,498
I miss you, too, darling.

593
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:17,209
Um... Not too well,
actually.

594
00:28:17,294 --> 00:28:18,961
Well, we've got some
cancellations, that's all.

595
00:28:19,046 --> 00:28:21,213
We got to Memphis and
there's no gig in Memphis,

596
00:28:21,298 --> 00:28:24,008
and we find out this
promoter in the Midwest

597
00:28:24,092 --> 00:28:27,470
has pulled out
St. Louis and Kansas City

598
00:28:27,971 --> 00:28:31,432
and Des Moines.

599
00:28:32,392 --> 00:28:35,311
I don't know, it's in
Indiana or something.

600
00:28:36,813 --> 00:28:38,189
I thought...

601
00:28:39,232 --> 00:28:40,900
Don't tease me.

602
00:28:40,984 --> 00:28:43,194
That's not until
April. Great!

603
00:28:43,487 --> 00:28:46,113
We'll do it!
Oh, fucking great.

604
00:28:47,491 --> 00:28:49,825
Milwaukee.
Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

605
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:53,162
I have no idea. You might have
to take a plane to New York,

606
00:28:53,246 --> 00:28:55,998
and then go to
Milwaukee from there.

607
00:28:57,667 --> 00:29:00,753
Oh, God, I love you, too.
Okay, bye.

608
00:29:03,882 --> 00:29:05,174
Well, my problems
are solved, mate.

609
00:29:05,258 --> 00:29:06,258
Who's that?

610
00:29:06,343 --> 00:29:08,427
Was Jeanine, she's
gonna come meet us.

611
00:29:08,512 --> 00:29:13,099
She was supposed to do this window
layout for Neil Kite's boutique.

612
00:29:13,517 --> 00:29:14,600
But it's not
until April!

613
00:29:14,684 --> 00:29:17,061
Is she coming to drop some stuff
off? You know, and going right back?

614
00:29:17,145 --> 00:29:19,605
No, no. She's coming on her
own. She's gonna travel with us.

615
00:29:19,731 --> 00:29:21,107
She's gonna go on
the road with us.

616
00:29:21,191 --> 00:29:22,274
Turn it up.
Turn it up!

617
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:24,735
She says she can hear that I'm
eating too much sugar on the phone.

618
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,862
She says my larynx is fat.

619
00:29:27,823 --> 00:29:29,365
You might want
to come next door.

620
00:29:29,449 --> 00:29:32,326
The radio is playing
a bit of your past.

621
00:29:33,912 --> 00:29:35,371
You happy for me?

622
00:29:39,918 --> 00:29:41,168
I don't believe it!

623
00:29:41,253 --> 00:29:42,962
...cups and cakes

624
00:29:43,046 --> 00:29:46,799
I'm so full my tummy aches

625
00:29:46,883 --> 00:29:51,262
How sad it must end
But I'm glad I have a friend

626
00:29:51,346 --> 00:29:54,431
Sharing cups
and cakes with me

627
00:29:54,516 --> 00:29:58,144
And cakes with me

628
00:29:58,228 --> 00:29:59,812
- Sounds good.
- Yeah?

629
00:29:59,896 --> 00:30:00,980
Oh, yeah!

630
00:30:01,064 --> 00:30:03,983
Going all the way
back to 1965, that one.

631
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:05,609
Doesn't it feel good?

632
00:30:05,694 --> 00:30:08,154
With The Thamesmen
and Cups and Cakes.

633
00:30:08,238 --> 00:30:09,238
You're an oldie!

634
00:30:09,322 --> 00:30:12,032
Of course, The Thamesmen later
changed their name to Spinal Tap.

635
00:30:12,117 --> 00:30:13,492
They had a couple
of nice size hits.

636
00:30:13,577 --> 00:30:16,328
They're currently residing in
the "Where Are They Now" file.

637
00:30:16,413 --> 00:30:18,914
Johnny Q with you on Golden
106, and right after we...

638
00:30:18,999 --> 00:30:20,249
Fuck you.

639
00:30:21,918 --> 00:30:23,544
I'm not really sure
this was such a great idea.

640
00:30:23,628 --> 00:30:27,464
I mean, I don't feel any
better than I did at the hotel.

641
00:30:28,258 --> 00:30:31,677
He was going to do a TV special
from here, before he died.

642
00:30:31,761 --> 00:30:35,347
Yeah, that's right, the musical
version of Somebody Up There Likes Me.

643
00:30:38,268 --> 00:30:41,270
Well, since my baby left me

644
00:30:41,354 --> 00:30:44,273
I found a new place to dwell

645
00:30:44,357 --> 00:30:47,109
Well, it's down at
the end of Lonely Street

646
00:30:47,194 --> 00:30:49,945
At Heartbreak Hotel

647
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,655
Do it with the
harmony parts.

648
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,781
All right.

649
00:30:52,866 --> 00:30:54,617
Well, since my baby left me...
Since my baby...

650
00:30:54,701 --> 00:30:56,535
The same key,
though, I think.

651
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:59,455
Well, since my baby left me
Since my baby left me

652
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:00,539
If I'm going...

653
00:31:00,624 --> 00:31:02,041
Since my baby left me

654
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:03,500
Left me

655
00:31:03,585 --> 00:31:04,543
Me

656
00:31:04,628 --> 00:31:05,628
No, you can't
hit that note.

657
00:31:05,712 --> 00:31:07,213
Since my...

658
00:31:07,297 --> 00:31:10,424
Since my baby left me
Since my baby left me

659
00:31:10,508 --> 00:31:13,886
Well, I found
a new place to dwell

660
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:16,055
That's all right.
Not really, not really.

661
00:31:16,139 --> 00:31:17,806
Voice down.
Well, it sounds raga.

662
00:31:17,891 --> 00:31:18,933
You don't want to
go raga on this.

663
00:31:19,017 --> 00:31:20,309
No, not with this, it don't. It does.

664
00:31:20,393 --> 00:31:21,644
Well, since my baby left me

665
00:31:21,686 --> 00:31:23,604
It sounds fucking
barbershop. Don't... Hey.

666
00:31:23,688 --> 00:31:24,897
Barbershop raga.

667
00:31:24,981 --> 00:31:26,148
Watch the...
Watch the language.

668
00:31:26,191 --> 00:31:28,901
You're paying homage to
the King. A new hybrid.

669
00:31:28,985 --> 00:31:30,152
Sorry.

670
00:31:30,278 --> 00:31:33,405
This is
thoroughly depressing.

671
00:31:33,823 --> 00:31:35,991
It really puts perspective
on things, though, doesn't it?

672
00:31:36,076 --> 00:31:39,495
Too much. There's too much
fucking perspective now.

673
00:31:40,622 --> 00:31:42,539
In 1967, you...

674
00:31:42,624 --> 00:31:45,626
That was the first time
Spinal Tap came into existence.

675
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,087
Well, the whole world was
changing in those days.

676
00:31:48,171 --> 00:31:49,380
And also we had
the world's ear...

677
00:31:49,464 --> 00:31:50,589
We were changing
the world.

678
00:31:50,674 --> 00:31:52,967
...because we had just released
an enormous-selling single.

679
00:31:53,093 --> 00:31:55,427
Flower
People. Flower People.

680
00:31:55,512 --> 00:31:57,763
We toured the world,
we toured the States...

681
00:31:57,847 --> 00:31:59,390
We toured the world
and elsewhere.

682
00:31:59,474 --> 00:32:00,683
It was a dream come true.

683
00:32:00,767 --> 00:32:02,393
Listen

684
00:32:02,477 --> 00:32:05,729
To what the flower people say

685
00:32:09,859 --> 00:32:15,781
Listen, it's getting
louder every day

686
00:32:18,868 --> 00:32:23,372
Listen, it's
like a bolt out of the blue

687
00:32:27,836 --> 00:32:32,881
Listen, it could be
calling now for you

688
00:32:52,402 --> 00:32:55,237
Now during the Flower
People period, who was your drummer?

689
00:32:55,322 --> 00:32:57,656
Stumpy's replacement,
Peter "James" Bond,

690
00:32:57,741 --> 00:33:00,659
he also died in
mysterious circumstances.

691
00:33:00,744 --> 00:33:01,785
We were playing a...

692
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:02,828
Festival.

693
00:33:02,912 --> 00:33:04,455
...jazz-blues festival.
Where was that?

694
00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:06,415
- Blues-jazz, really.
- Blues-jazz festival.

695
00:33:06,499 --> 00:33:09,001
It was the Isle...
It was in the Isle of...

696
00:33:09,085 --> 00:33:10,085
Isle of Lucy.
Isle of Lucy.

697
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:12,004
The Isle of Lucy Jazz-Blues
Festival. Isle of Lucy.

698
00:33:12,088 --> 00:33:15,883
And it was tragic, really.
He exploded on stage.

699
00:33:17,177 --> 00:33:18,177
Just like that.

700
00:33:18,261 --> 00:33:19,303
He just went up.

701
00:33:19,387 --> 00:33:22,014
He just was like a flash of green light,

702
00:33:22,974 --> 00:33:24,808
and that was it.
Nothing was left.

703
00:33:24,893 --> 00:33:26,393
Look at his face.
Well, there was.

704
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:27,519
It's true, this really
did happen. It's true.

705
00:33:27,604 --> 00:33:30,522
There was a little green
globule on his drum seat.

706
00:33:30,607 --> 00:33:31,607
Like a
stain, really.

707
00:33:31,691 --> 00:33:33,484
It was more of a stain
than a globule, actually, and...

708
00:33:33,568 --> 00:33:35,819
You know, several... You
know, dozens of people

709
00:33:35,904 --> 00:33:38,238
spontaneously
combust each year.

710
00:33:38,323 --> 00:33:40,032
It's just not really widely reported.

711
00:33:40,116 --> 00:33:41,367
Right.

712
00:33:43,661 --> 00:33:45,913
Testing.
Hello, hello.

713
00:33:45,997 --> 00:33:49,083
Test, test, test. This is mic
number one. This is mic number one.

714
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:50,209
Isn't this
a lot of fun?

715
00:33:50,293 --> 00:33:52,127
Two, two.
Okay, got the mics.

716
00:33:52,212 --> 00:33:55,506
Let's do GSM,
all right? GSM.

717
00:33:58,426 --> 00:34:00,636
Stop wasting my time

718
00:34:02,222 --> 00:34:05,099
You know what I want

719
00:34:06,267 --> 00:34:09,144
You know what I need

720
00:34:09,938 --> 00:34:12,481
Or maybe you don't

721
00:34:14,651 --> 00:34:19,446
Do I have to come right smack
damn out and tell you everything?

722
00:34:19,531 --> 00:34:22,449
Gimme some money

723
00:34:23,576 --> 00:34:26,829
Gimme some money

724
00:34:26,913 --> 00:34:28,163
Oh, yeah!

725
00:34:33,837 --> 00:34:35,462
Hello, darling.

726
00:34:36,548 --> 00:34:39,133
Hello, I've got a
surprise for you.

727
00:34:39,217 --> 00:34:40,926
Hey! Where'd
you come from?

728
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:43,262
Where do you
think I came from?

729
00:34:43,346 --> 00:34:45,639
Bloody airplane,
didn't I? Right?

730
00:34:48,685 --> 00:34:53,105
David. David.
David. David.

731
00:34:55,733 --> 00:34:59,945
Feels good. I've been wanting
to do that for the longest time.

732
00:35:01,865 --> 00:35:03,365
Want me to carry
you about with me?

733
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:05,617
What's all this?
What? Tell me.

734
00:35:05,702 --> 00:35:06,743
That's the film crew.

735
00:35:06,828 --> 00:35:09,746
I told you about this.
It's the film crew. Martin?

736
00:35:09,831 --> 00:35:10,914
Hi, Martin.
This is Jeanine.

737
00:35:10,999 --> 00:35:12,458
Hello.
- Hello.

738
00:35:13,418 --> 00:35:15,127
Here it is! It's
Visitors' Day, isn't it?

739
00:35:15,211 --> 00:35:16,295
Here it is, lads!

740
00:35:16,379 --> 00:35:17,421
We better turn to...

741
00:35:17,505 --> 00:35:18,839
Smell the Glove,
me old beauties!

742
00:35:18,923 --> 00:35:19,965
Oh, really?

743
00:35:20,049 --> 00:35:21,091
Gather around.
Where's David?

744
00:35:21,176 --> 00:35:22,176
Come on, Ian,
you're kidding.

745
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,470
David. David,
get up here!

746
00:35:24,554 --> 00:35:28,223
David, Smell the
Glove is here. Hello, Jeanine.

747
00:35:28,308 --> 00:35:29,975
The moment we've all
been waiting for.

748
00:35:30,059 --> 00:35:31,643
I thought
I'd never see it.

749
00:35:31,728 --> 00:35:33,645
Here we go. I never
thought I'd live to see the day.

750
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,355
Plenty for everybody.

751
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,523
Wait a minute.
A little fanfare.

752
00:35:36,608 --> 00:35:37,649
What do you think?

753
00:35:37,734 --> 00:35:39,026
Is this the
test pressing?

754
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,611
No, this is it.
Yes, that's right.

755
00:35:40,695 --> 00:35:42,279
This is Smell the Glove
by Spinal Tap?

756
00:35:42,363 --> 00:35:43,864
When you go to the store...
That's Smell the Glove.

757
00:35:43,948 --> 00:35:47,618
That's the jacket cover that's going
out across the country in every store.

758
00:35:47,744 --> 00:35:49,369
Is this the compromise you made? Yes.

759
00:35:49,454 --> 00:35:50,871
Is it going to say anything
here or along the spine?

760
00:35:50,914 --> 00:35:52,623
It doesn't even say anything?
It's not going to say anything.

761
00:35:52,749 --> 00:35:54,333
It's just going to be all
black? It's going to be that,

762
00:35:54,417 --> 00:35:56,960
simple, beautiful,
classic.

763
00:35:57,045 --> 00:35:58,754
Does look like, you know, black leather.

764
00:35:58,838 --> 00:36:00,881
You can see yourself
in both sides.

765
00:36:00,965 --> 00:36:02,508
I wouldn't
feel so bad...

766
00:36:02,592 --> 00:36:04,343
It's like a black
mirror. Yeah, it is.

767
00:36:04,427 --> 00:36:06,136
Well, I think it
looks like death.

768
00:36:06,221 --> 00:36:08,138
It looks like mourning.
I mean, it looks...

769
00:36:08,223 --> 00:36:11,016
David, David, every movie in
every cinema is about death.

770
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,684
Death sells!

771
00:36:12,769 --> 00:36:14,478
I think he's right,
there's something about this

772
00:36:14,562 --> 00:36:18,357
that's so black, it's like, "How
much more black could this be?"

773
00:36:18,441 --> 00:36:22,027
And the answer is,
"None, none more black."

774
00:36:22,111 --> 00:36:24,363
I think you're, like,
rationalizing this whole thing

775
00:36:24,447 --> 00:36:27,449
into something that
you did on purpose.

776
00:36:27,534 --> 00:36:29,826
I think we're stuck
with a very, very stupid

777
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:31,954
and a very
dismal-looking album.

778
00:36:32,038 --> 00:36:33,205
This is depressing!

779
00:36:33,289 --> 00:36:34,540
This is something you
wear around your arm,

780
00:36:34,624 --> 00:36:35,791
you don't put this on
your fucking turntable.

781
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:36,959
David, it's a choice.

782
00:36:37,043 --> 00:36:39,378
I frankly think that this
is the turning point, okay?

783
00:36:39,462 --> 00:36:41,880
I think this is...
We're on our way now.

784
00:36:41,965 --> 00:36:44,299
It's time to kick ass!
- I agree, I agree.

785
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:19,001
When there
was darkness

786
00:37:19,085 --> 00:37:24,172
And the void was king
and ruled the elements

787
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:30,596
When there was silence and
the hush was almost deafening

788
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:36,560
Out of the emptiness

789
00:37:36,644 --> 00:37:38,562
Salvation

790
00:37:38,646 --> 00:37:40,063
Salvation

791
00:37:41,691 --> 00:37:44,151
Rhythm and light and sound

792
00:37:45,445 --> 00:37:48,947
'Twas the rock 'n' roll
creation

793
00:37:49,032 --> 00:37:51,992
'Twas a terrible big bang

794
00:37:52,076 --> 00:37:55,746
'Twas the ultimate mutation

795
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:58,957
Yin was searching
for his yang

796
00:37:59,042 --> 00:38:03,337
And he looked and he
saw that it was good

797
00:38:14,515 --> 00:38:21,063
I look to the stars
and the answer is clear

798
00:38:21,814 --> 00:38:28,236
I look in the mirror
and see what I fear

799
00:38:44,045 --> 00:38:47,631
'Tis the rock 'n' roll
creation

800
00:38:47,715 --> 00:38:51,301
'Tis the absolute rebirth

801
00:38:51,386 --> 00:38:54,805
'Tis the rolling of the ocean

802
00:38:54,889 --> 00:38:57,974
And the rocking
of the earth

803
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:01,895
And I looked and I
saw that it was good

804
00:39:26,629 --> 00:39:30,507
Given the history of Spinal
Tap drummers in the past,

805
00:39:30,591 --> 00:39:34,177
do you have any
fears for your life?

806
00:39:34,262 --> 00:39:36,388
When I did join, you know,
they did tell me.

807
00:39:36,472 --> 00:39:38,348
They kind of took
me aside and said,

808
00:39:38,433 --> 00:39:40,976
"Well, Mick, you know,
it's like this."

809
00:39:41,644 --> 00:39:44,020
And it did kind of
freak me out a bit,

810
00:39:44,105 --> 00:39:47,274
but it can't always
happen to... Can it?

811
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:49,067
Right. Right.

812
00:39:49,152 --> 00:39:50,318
I mean, really.
The law of averages says...

813
00:39:50,403 --> 00:39:51,403
The law of averages.

814
00:39:51,487 --> 00:39:52,571
It says you will survive. Yeah.

815
00:39:56,451 --> 00:39:57,534
Whoa.

816
00:39:57,618 --> 00:40:02,038
Quite exciting. Quite
exciting, this computer magic.

817
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:04,040
Whee!

818
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:06,251
How many planets
have you destroyed, Viv?

819
00:40:06,335 --> 00:40:10,046
Well, fourth or fifth time round,
I think. We're doing really five.

820
00:40:10,131 --> 00:40:11,548
Few galaxies gone,
you know...

821
00:40:14,177 --> 00:40:15,177
Don't.

822
00:40:15,261 --> 00:40:16,344
This is Cindy's
first mustache.

823
00:40:16,429 --> 00:40:17,429
Is it?

824
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:20,640
Can I take it off now?

825
00:40:20,725 --> 00:40:22,058
Why? Too hot in it?

826
00:40:22,143 --> 00:40:23,518
No, it's...

827
00:40:23,853 --> 00:40:25,061
I thought I might
go back to see

828
00:40:25,146 --> 00:40:26,938
what they were up to
back there, you know.

829
00:40:27,023 --> 00:40:28,440
Don't think they really
need to see this

830
00:40:28,524 --> 00:40:29,858
until you're finished
with it, you know.

831
00:40:29,942 --> 00:40:32,778
Well, you were reading.
You can read here.

832
00:40:33,196 --> 00:40:37,199
Yeah, but they got the new game
back there. Thought I'd maybe...

833
00:40:37,784 --> 00:40:39,910
Thought I'd have a look at the new game.

834
00:40:39,994 --> 00:40:41,369
It's like
a submarine thing.

835
00:40:41,454 --> 00:40:43,497
You've got all this
stuff all over you again.

836
00:40:43,706 --> 00:40:47,375
Before I met Jeanine, my
life was cosmically in shambles.

837
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,628
It was... I was using
bits and pieces

838
00:40:49,712 --> 00:40:51,296
of whatever
Eastern philosophies

839
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,507
happened to drift
through my transom.

840
00:40:53,591 --> 00:40:56,968
And she sort of sorted it out for
me, straightened it out for me.

841
00:40:57,053 --> 00:40:59,137
Gave me a path, you know,
a path to follow.

842
00:40:59,222 --> 00:41:02,974
I wonder if you have as much
influence over his musical expression.

843
00:41:03,059 --> 00:41:05,143
Oh, yeah. I mean,
I listen to him

844
00:41:05,228 --> 00:41:07,312
when he's experimenting
and things like that.

845
00:41:07,396 --> 00:41:08,522
Don't I, doll?

846
00:41:08,606 --> 00:41:11,650
He plays things
to me sometimes

847
00:41:11,734 --> 00:41:15,946
when he's got a new bit that he
wants to tell me about, you know,

848
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,948
and I say, "Yeah, that's
good," or, "That's bad,"

849
00:41:18,032 --> 00:41:19,491
or, "That's shit,"
or whatever.

850
00:41:19,575 --> 00:41:20,826
- Yeah.
- You know.

851
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:23,703
Yes, she's very honest,
she's brutally frank.

852
00:41:23,788 --> 00:41:25,664
Well, how does that go
over with the other band members?

853
00:41:25,748 --> 00:41:27,332
I mean, you...

854
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:30,252
Well, what happens is, she gives
me the brutally frank version,

855
00:41:30,336 --> 00:41:31,378
and I sort of tart
it up for them.

856
00:41:31,462 --> 00:41:32,462
Yeah.

857
00:41:32,547 --> 00:41:36,508
And of course it's so strange
because Nigel and Jeanine

858
00:41:36,592 --> 00:41:40,846
are so similar in so many
ways, but they just can't...

859
00:41:41,514 --> 00:41:43,348
They don't dislike
each other at all. No.

860
00:41:43,432 --> 00:41:44,724
There's a great love
between the two of them.

861
00:41:44,809 --> 00:41:46,017
Oh, yes.

862
00:41:46,102 --> 00:41:47,644
But there's some sort of communication

863
00:41:47,728 --> 00:41:50,564
that's just not... It's
just blocked or something.

864
00:42:06,205 --> 00:42:07,706
It's pretty.

865
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:08,999
Yeah, I like it.

866
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:12,377
Just been fooling about
with it for a few months now.

867
00:42:12,461 --> 00:42:14,045
Very delicate.

868
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:16,381
It's a bit of
a departure

869
00:42:16,465 --> 00:42:18,842
from the kind of thing
you normally play.

870
00:42:19,176 --> 00:42:21,928
Yeah, well, it's part
of a trilogy, really,

871
00:42:22,013 --> 00:42:23,930
a musical trilogy
that I'm doing,

872
00:42:24,849 --> 00:42:28,143
in D minor,
which I always find

873
00:42:28,227 --> 00:42:30,228
is really the saddest
of all keys.

874
00:42:30,313 --> 00:42:33,565
Really. I don't know why, but it makes
people weep instantly, to play a...

875
00:42:36,819 --> 00:42:38,486
It's a horn part.

876
00:42:38,738 --> 00:42:40,405
It's very pretty.

877
00:42:42,491 --> 00:42:45,660
You know, just simple
lines intertwining.

878
00:42:45,745 --> 00:42:49,205
You know, very much like... I'm
really influenced by Mozart and Bach,

879
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:50,582
and it's sort of in
between, though,

880
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:52,500
it's like a Mach
piece, really.

881
00:42:52,585 --> 00:42:54,502
What do you
call this?

882
00:42:54,587 --> 00:42:57,547
Well, this piece is
called Lick My Love Pump.

883
00:42:58,966 --> 00:43:02,761
Midwest
Airlines, Flight 406...

884
00:43:04,013 --> 00:43:06,097
Excuse me, sir. Do you have any
metal objects in your pockets?

885
00:43:06,182 --> 00:43:07,390
Yeah. Take them out and put them

886
00:43:07,475 --> 00:43:09,309
in the bucket.
Right.

887
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:11,519
Coins, keys.

888
00:43:15,524 --> 00:43:16,942
Tuning fork.

889
00:43:17,443 --> 00:43:20,654
Musician. I like to stay in
tune, you know? There you go.

890
00:43:21,864 --> 00:43:23,198
Be a moment.

891
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:27,953
Okay. Could you take
this jacket off, please?

892
00:43:28,037 --> 00:43:30,997
Oh, it's the zipper
setting off the machine.

893
00:43:31,082 --> 00:43:33,625
Let's go, then.
Let's go, hurry up.

894
00:43:36,963 --> 00:43:38,922
Step over here,
please.

895
00:43:39,006 --> 00:43:39,965
Troublemaker.

896
00:43:40,049 --> 00:43:41,633
Raise your arms.

897
00:43:41,717 --> 00:43:43,635
MAN ON PA:... scheduled
for departure at Gate 12

898
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:46,554
has been delayed
approximately 20 minutes.

899
00:44:01,237 --> 00:44:03,905
Do you have any
artificial plates or limbs?

900
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:05,573
Not really, no.

901
00:44:06,909 --> 00:44:08,118
Would you...

902
00:44:08,202 --> 00:44:09,369
Yeah, do it.

903
00:44:17,128 --> 00:44:18,253
Nice!

904
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:31,516
I don't need a
woman I won't take me no wife

905
00:44:33,102 --> 00:44:37,981
I got the rock 'n' roll
And that'll be my life

906
00:44:41,193 --> 00:44:46,614
No page in history, baby
That, I don't need

907
00:44:47,742 --> 00:44:52,287
I just wanna make
some eardrums bleed

908
00:44:53,622 --> 00:44:55,206
Heavy
Heavy

909
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:57,125
Duty
Duty

910
00:44:57,626 --> 00:45:00,879
Heavy duty rock 'n' roll

911
00:45:06,218 --> 00:45:08,011
Heavy
Heavy

912
00:45:08,095 --> 00:45:09,888
Duty
Duty

913
00:45:09,972 --> 00:45:14,684
Brings out the
duty in my soul

914
00:45:47,343 --> 00:45:48,843
Hi. Artie Fufkin.

915
00:45:48,969 --> 00:45:50,845
Hey, Artie. ARTIE:
Polymer Records. How are you?

916
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:52,722
Hey, how you doing?
You are...

917
00:45:52,807 --> 00:45:53,848
Derek.
Derek.

918
00:45:53,933 --> 00:45:55,350
Artie Fufkin,
Polymer Records.

919
00:45:55,476 --> 00:45:56,810
Hello, Artie. How are
you? I'm your promo man

920
00:45:56,852 --> 00:45:58,394
here in Chicago. Nice to
meet you. Well, that's great.

921
00:45:58,479 --> 00:45:59,938
I love you guys.
And of course, Nigel.

922
00:46:00,022 --> 00:46:01,147
Nigel.

923
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:03,233
I love you. Nigel Tufnel. Right.

924
00:46:03,317 --> 00:46:05,151
I love your stuff. I
go back with you guys.

925
00:46:05,236 --> 00:46:07,445
Boy, do I... Artie
Fufkin, Polymer Records.

926
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:08,738
I love you. And who are you, darling?

927
00:46:08,823 --> 00:46:10,448
Oh, this is my special
new friend, Cindy.

928
00:46:10,533 --> 00:46:11,574
Hello, Cindy.

929
00:46:11,659 --> 00:46:13,326
And this is Belinda.
Hello, Belinda.

930
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:14,494
Hi, nice to meet you.

931
00:46:14,578 --> 00:46:15,787
Artie Fufkin, Polymer Records, promo.

932
00:46:15,871 --> 00:46:18,248
And I... Oh, what's
going on here? Hi.

933
00:46:18,332 --> 00:46:19,415
Oh, they're
making a...

934
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,708
Hi, guys. Artie Fufkin,
Polymer Records.

935
00:46:20,793 --> 00:46:21,751
Nice to see you.

936
00:46:21,836 --> 00:46:23,211
And where is David?

937
00:46:23,295 --> 00:46:24,587
Oh, David, hi.

938
00:46:24,672 --> 00:46:26,381
Artie Fufkin. How are you?

939
00:46:26,465 --> 00:46:27,465
It's nice to see you.

940
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:28,967
We've got something
exciting happening tomorrow.

941
00:46:29,051 --> 00:46:31,386
All right, the food.
The food.

942
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:35,723
Oh, thank God. Civilization!
Where do I put this?

943
00:47:02,334 --> 00:47:03,585
What are you
doing to me here?

944
00:47:03,711 --> 00:47:05,628
I'm not doing anything. I thought
we had a relationship here.

945
00:47:05,713 --> 00:47:06,880
I don't know
what happened.

946
00:47:06,964 --> 00:47:08,173
Business is terrible,
Artie.

947
00:47:08,257 --> 00:47:09,591
What can I tell you?
This is the truth.

948
00:47:09,675 --> 00:47:10,675
I know business
is terrible,

949
00:47:10,759 --> 00:47:12,218
but what happens
with the record store

950
00:47:12,303 --> 00:47:13,678
with a promotion
and nobody shows up?

951
00:47:13,762 --> 00:47:15,096
This isn't a personal
thing, Artie.

952
00:47:15,139 --> 00:47:16,639
Nobody's coming to the
store... Forget personal thing.

953
00:47:16,724 --> 00:47:20,226
We had a relationship here. Forget about
personal, what about our relationship?

954
00:47:22,104 --> 00:47:25,398
I feel like a schlub, and I
don't know what's happening.

955
00:47:25,482 --> 00:47:27,192
It's me. That's
what's happening.

956
00:47:27,276 --> 00:47:29,819
It's me. I did it.
It's my fault.

957
00:47:29,904 --> 00:47:30,904
I know.

958
00:47:30,988 --> 00:47:32,280
We were told "massive radio support."

959
00:47:32,323 --> 00:47:34,365
We did. We did massive, we did
massive. Sponsoring, vast...

960
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:35,575
We saturated.
We oversaturated.

961
00:47:35,659 --> 00:47:37,035
They said
vast radio support.

962
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,537
That's what it is. It's
me. I did it. I fucked up.

963
00:47:39,622 --> 00:47:41,623
I fucked up the timing, that's
all. I fucked up the timing.

964
00:47:41,707 --> 00:47:43,875
I got no timing, I got no
timing. I got no timing.

965
00:47:43,959 --> 00:47:46,044
You know what I want you to do?
Will you do something for me?

966
00:47:46,128 --> 00:47:47,879
What?
Do me a favor.

967
00:47:47,963 --> 00:47:49,964
Just kick my
ass, okay?

968
00:47:50,049 --> 00:47:51,799
Kick this ass for
a man, that's all.

969
00:47:51,884 --> 00:47:53,009
Kick my ass!
No.

970
00:47:53,093 --> 00:47:55,094
Enjoy! Come on.
I'm not asking,

971
00:47:55,179 --> 00:47:56,846
I'm telling with this.
Kick my ass.

972
00:48:09,818 --> 00:48:12,820
Well, we've kept them waiting
long enough. Let's do it to them.

973
00:48:12,905 --> 00:48:13,905
Come on, Mick!

974
00:48:15,366 --> 00:48:16,908
Let's go, Mr. Shrimpton.

975
00:48:16,992 --> 00:48:20,328
Rock 'n' roll!

976
00:48:23,123 --> 00:48:25,166
Let's hear some
rock 'n' roll!

977
00:48:25,251 --> 00:48:27,502
Rock 'n' roll!
Let's go, then.

978
00:48:29,171 --> 00:48:30,546
Yeah, mate.

979
00:48:32,007 --> 00:48:33,299
It's gonna be a hot one, isn't it?

980
00:48:33,384 --> 00:48:34,425
It's gonna
be a great show.

981
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:36,469
No, it's not an exit.
It's not an exit.

982
00:48:36,553 --> 00:48:38,054
Don't want an exit.
No, that's true.

983
00:48:38,138 --> 00:48:39,973
Oh, this way.
Hope so.

984
00:48:40,099 --> 00:48:42,350
Yeah, this way, let's
go. Probably this way.

985
00:48:47,606 --> 00:48:49,232
This
looks familiar, though.

986
00:48:49,316 --> 00:48:51,109
Listen.
Really does.

987
00:48:55,531 --> 00:48:56,572
Shit.

988
00:48:56,699 --> 00:48:57,782
That way.

989
00:48:59,034 --> 00:49:01,035
Let's not lose it, now.
Let's not lose it.

990
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,496
Where the fuck is Ian?
You know, he should be here.

991
00:49:06,542 --> 00:49:08,376
We gotta get to it
some way.

992
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,503
We've been on stage, right?

993
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,673
We're in the group.

994
00:49:13,799 --> 00:49:15,550
We're in the group
that's playing tonight.

995
00:49:15,759 --> 00:49:17,927
You go right straight
through this door here,

996
00:49:18,053 --> 00:49:20,221
down the hall,
turn right,

997
00:49:20,889 --> 00:49:24,142
and then there's a little
jog there, about 30 feet.

998
00:49:24,226 --> 00:49:26,102
Jog to the... We don't
have time for that.

999
00:49:26,228 --> 00:49:28,396
Go straight ahead. We'll
trust you, we'll trust you.

1000
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,191
Turn right the next two
corners, and first door, a sign,

1001
00:49:32,276 --> 00:49:34,319
"Authorized
Personnel Only,"

1002
00:49:34,403 --> 00:49:36,321
open that door.
That's the stage.

1003
00:49:36,405 --> 00:49:38,031
You think so?
You're authorized.

1004
00:49:38,157 --> 00:49:39,532
You're musicians, aren't
you? We've got the guitars.

1005
00:49:39,658 --> 00:49:41,534
Exactly. Thank you, thank you very much.

1006
00:49:41,618 --> 00:49:43,119
Rock 'n' roll!

1007
00:49:43,746 --> 00:49:45,330
Rock 'n' roll!
Yeah!

1008
00:49:45,414 --> 00:49:47,999
Let's get it,
let's get it!

1009
00:49:48,083 --> 00:49:50,001
No, he said this way.

1010
00:49:50,085 --> 00:49:52,128
Straight here. Rock 'n' roll!
Here we go! Rock 'n' roll!

1011
00:49:52,212 --> 00:49:55,715
Hello, Cleveland!
Hello, Cleveland!

1012
00:49:55,799 --> 00:49:57,383
Let's go in.

1013
00:49:57,468 --> 00:49:58,634
Fuck!

1014
00:49:59,678 --> 00:50:01,220
You must have
made a wrong turn.

1015
00:50:01,347 --> 00:50:02,889
We've got to
go another way.

1016
00:50:02,973 --> 00:50:06,517
Other way.
Other way. Other way.

1017
00:50:07,019 --> 00:50:08,353
I hate to keep
harping on this,

1018
00:50:08,437 --> 00:50:11,564
but I think that the notion of a
black album has really cursed us.

1019
00:50:11,648 --> 00:50:14,192
Believe me, we're getting some
very substantial reports of air play.

1020
00:50:14,276 --> 00:50:15,943
I don't think we have
to worry about that.

1021
00:50:16,028 --> 00:50:18,321
You know, it might
have been better

1022
00:50:18,447 --> 00:50:20,740
if the album had
been mixed right.

1023
00:50:20,824 --> 00:50:22,492
Well, there's no use
crying over that.

1024
00:50:22,618 --> 00:50:24,327
Of course, that's true.
I mean...

1025
00:50:24,411 --> 00:50:25,828
Well, it
just wasn't...

1026
00:50:25,913 --> 00:50:27,246
It was mixed all wrong,
wasn't it?

1027
00:50:27,331 --> 00:50:28,331
It was mixed wrong?
Yeah.

1028
00:50:28,415 --> 00:50:29,916
Were you there? How do you
know... You couldn't hear...

1029
00:50:30,042 --> 00:50:32,001
She's heard the record.
No, but I've heard the album.

1030
00:50:32,086 --> 00:50:34,545
So your judgment is
it was mixed wrong.

1031
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:36,381
You couldn't hear
the lyrics on all of it.

1032
00:50:36,465 --> 00:50:37,924
You don't agree that
you can't hear the vocals?

1033
00:50:38,008 --> 00:50:39,842
No,
I do not agree. No.

1034
00:50:39,927 --> 00:50:42,887
Well, I think maybe it's interesting
that she's bringing it up.

1035
00:50:42,971 --> 00:50:44,597
Well, she'd like
to hear vocals.

1036
00:50:44,681 --> 00:50:46,140
It's like me saying,
you know,

1037
00:50:46,225 --> 00:50:48,893
"You're using the wrong
conditioner for your hair."

1038
00:50:48,977 --> 00:50:50,269
Don't be
stupid now.

1039
00:50:50,354 --> 00:50:51,479
It looks sort of frizzy.

1040
00:50:51,563 --> 00:50:53,981
You don't do heavy metal
in Doubly, you know. You mix it.

1041
00:50:54,066 --> 00:50:55,817
In what? In what?

1042
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:58,152
What?
- Dolby.

1043
00:50:58,612 --> 00:50:59,821
In Doubly.
I mean, you can't...

1044
00:50:59,863 --> 00:51:01,989
- In Dublin? What's that?
- She means Dolby, all right?

1045
00:51:02,074 --> 00:51:04,325
She means Dolby. You know
perfectly well what she means.

1046
00:51:05,035 --> 00:51:06,411
We shan't
recover from this one.

1047
00:51:06,495 --> 00:51:07,787
We shan't recover
from this one.

1048
00:51:07,871 --> 00:51:08,996
Come on.

1049
00:51:09,081 --> 00:51:10,206
Can I have the floor
for just one moment?

1050
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:13,334
Because I've got something
I'd like to show you.

1051
00:51:13,836 --> 00:51:16,587
Jeanine's been working
on these very hard.

1052
00:51:16,672 --> 00:51:18,339
These are
a new direction...

1053
00:51:18,424 --> 00:51:20,049
Got a new idea
for a new presentation.

1054
00:51:20,134 --> 00:51:21,717
DAVID:... for the stage
look of the band.

1055
00:51:21,802 --> 00:51:23,302
The signs of the zodiac for everyone.

1056
00:51:23,429 --> 00:51:25,763
I thought we needed a new presentation.
It's the signs of the zodiac.

1057
00:51:25,848 --> 00:51:27,515
This is a look for Viv.
He's a Libra.

1058
00:51:27,683 --> 00:51:29,392
There's the yin-yang...

1059
00:51:29,476 --> 00:51:31,602
Yin and the yang.
DAVID:... sort of look.

1060
00:51:31,687 --> 00:51:34,814
This is Nigel.
He's a Capricorn.

1061
00:51:35,357 --> 00:51:37,108
We've given you a little beard.

1062
00:51:37,192 --> 00:51:38,401
Is this a joke?

1063
00:51:38,485 --> 00:51:39,610
This is...

1064
00:51:39,695 --> 00:51:41,446
Excuse me, is this a joke?

1065
00:51:41,572 --> 00:51:43,364
Just bear with us
for one moment, please.

1066
00:51:43,449 --> 00:51:46,117
This, I love this.
I wish I were the Cancer.

1067
00:51:46,285 --> 00:51:47,410
That's attractive.

1068
00:51:47,494 --> 00:51:48,536
This is your crab face.

1069
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:49,912
Your brainchild, now.

1070
00:51:49,997 --> 00:51:51,205
Give it a chance,
give it a chance.

1071
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:53,249
And this is David...
David's the lion.

1072
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:57,920
Please wait a minute. Have
you any idea what it will cost

1073
00:51:59,214 --> 00:52:01,174
to dress up
the band as animals?

1074
00:52:01,258 --> 00:52:02,425
Well, they're
not animals.

1075
00:52:02,509 --> 00:52:03,593
They're signs of the zodiac.

1076
00:52:03,677 --> 00:52:05,470
It's a way
to fight the drabs.

1077
00:52:05,554 --> 00:52:07,305
You know,
we've got the drabs.

1078
00:52:07,389 --> 00:52:10,433
That's true. I think mine
will look better in Doubly,

1079
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,226
if it was done in Doubly.

1080
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,688
I'm quite open-minded enough.

1081
00:52:15,772 --> 00:52:16,981
David.
No, no, David.

1082
00:52:17,065 --> 00:52:19,817
You know, there are
solutions to our problems.

1083
00:52:19,902 --> 00:52:20,902
I think we know
what they are.

1084
00:52:20,986 --> 00:52:23,070
I've yet to hear them.
I've yet to hear them.

1085
00:52:23,155 --> 00:52:24,655
Since you're all
such geniuses...

1086
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,908
We take a rational approach,
we can say...

1087
00:52:26,992 --> 00:52:28,910
May I make a suggestion?
I've got one other suggestion.

1088
00:52:28,994 --> 00:52:30,453
Let's hear yours.
Let's hear your suggestion.

1089
00:52:30,537 --> 00:52:32,663
Stonehenge. Stonehenge.

1090
00:52:33,582 --> 00:52:35,791
What about it? Best production
value we've ever had on stage.

1091
00:52:35,876 --> 00:52:37,043
But we haven't
got the equipment.

1092
00:52:37,169 --> 00:52:38,753
We haven't got Stonehenge.
Not yet we don't.

1093
00:52:38,837 --> 00:52:41,172
Let's... Please,
please, just a moment.

1094
00:52:41,256 --> 00:52:43,341
We know it works. NIGEL:
Musically, we all know it.

1095
00:52:43,425 --> 00:52:44,509
I don't think
it's a bad idea.

1096
00:52:44,593 --> 00:52:45,551
Musically,
we all know it, right?

1097
00:52:45,636 --> 00:52:48,387
No problems musically.
We go right on stage,

1098
00:52:48,472 --> 00:52:50,181
and it's quite simple.

1099
00:52:50,265 --> 00:52:52,475
Ian can take care of this.

1100
00:52:52,809 --> 00:52:54,435
I know what the
Stonehenge monument looks like.

1101
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,270
We don't have that piece
of scenery anymore.

1102
00:52:56,355 --> 00:52:58,606
I know,
so we build a new one.

1103
00:52:59,942 --> 00:53:01,442
And this it.

1104
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:03,110
Consider it done.

1105
00:53:04,071 --> 00:53:05,571
So, you're just gonna
take care of it like that?

1106
00:53:05,656 --> 00:53:07,865
You're gonna find someone to
design it, using that as a plan?

1107
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:08,950
Let's try.
Let's try.

1108
00:53:09,034 --> 00:53:10,117
If you can do it,
I'll do the number.

1109
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:13,871
Do you feel that,
in collaboration with David,

1110
00:53:13,956 --> 00:53:18,417
that you are afforded the opportunity
to express yourself musically

1111
00:53:18,502 --> 00:53:19,669
the way you would like to?

1112
00:53:19,753 --> 00:53:22,004
Well, I think I do,
in my solos.

1113
00:53:22,089 --> 00:53:23,673
My solos are
my trademark.

1114
00:54:09,678 --> 00:54:12,013
This looks absolutely
perfect. I mean, it's...

1115
00:54:12,097 --> 00:54:14,098
It's the right proportions.
It'll be this color, eh?

1116
00:54:14,558 --> 00:54:16,809
Yeah.
That's just terrific.

1117
00:54:16,935 --> 00:54:19,770
I mean, it almost looks like
the real thing. You got it.

1118
00:54:19,855 --> 00:54:22,815
Yeah. When we get the actual
set, when we get the piece,

1119
00:54:22,899 --> 00:54:24,692
it'll follow exactly
these specifications,

1120
00:54:24,818 --> 00:54:26,611
even these contours
and everything?

1121
00:54:26,695 --> 00:54:30,448
I don't understand, Ian.
The actual piece?

1122
00:54:30,532 --> 00:54:32,742
When you build
the actual piece.

1123
00:54:32,868 --> 00:54:35,077
But this is what you
asked for, isn't it?

1124
00:54:35,412 --> 00:54:36,537
What?

1125
00:54:37,122 --> 00:54:38,205
Well, this is the piece.

1126
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:39,373
This is the piece?

1127
00:54:39,833 --> 00:54:40,708
Yes.

1128
00:54:40,792 --> 00:54:42,543
Are you telling
me that this is it?

1129
00:54:43,545 --> 00:54:45,129
This is scenery?

1130
00:54:45,464 --> 00:54:47,089
Have you ever
been to Stonehenge?

1131
00:54:47,174 --> 00:54:48,382
No, I've never
been to Stonehenge.

1132
00:54:48,508 --> 00:54:50,384
The triptychs
are 20-feet high!

1133
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:52,303
You can stand four men up them. Ian!

1134
00:54:52,387 --> 00:54:54,347
I was asked to build it...
This is insane!

1135
00:54:54,473 --> 00:54:56,515
This isn't a piece of scenery.
...18 inches high. Look, look.

1136
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,517
Look, this is what I
was asked to build.

1137
00:54:58,602 --> 00:55:01,896
Eighteen inches. Right
here, it specified 18 inches.

1138
00:55:02,564 --> 00:55:03,814
I was given this napkin.
I mean...

1139
00:55:03,899 --> 00:55:04,899
Forget this!

1140
00:55:04,983 --> 00:55:05,983
Fuck the napkin!

1141
00:55:10,864 --> 00:55:13,324
In ancient times

1142
00:55:15,035 --> 00:55:18,996
Hundreds of years
before the dawn of history

1143
00:55:20,707 --> 00:55:23,417
Lived an ancient
race of people

1144
00:55:26,421 --> 00:55:27,922
The Druids

1145
00:55:37,516 --> 00:55:40,601
No one knows who they were

1146
00:55:42,145 --> 00:55:45,815
Or what they were doing

1147
00:55:48,026 --> 00:55:50,611
But their legacy remains

1148
00:55:51,738 --> 00:55:58,661
Hewn into the living rock
of Stonehenge

1149
00:56:11,091 --> 00:56:14,552
Stonehenge,
where the demons dwell

1150
00:56:14,636 --> 00:56:18,222
Where the banshees live
and they do live well

1151
00:56:18,682 --> 00:56:21,892
Stonehenge,
where a man's a man

1152
00:56:21,977 --> 00:56:25,896
And the children
dance to the pipes of Pan

1153
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:35,239
And you, my love,
won't you take my hand?

1154
00:56:36,867 --> 00:56:42,580
We'll go back in time
to that mystic land

1155
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:49,587
Where the dewdrops cry
and the cats meow

1156
00:56:51,173 --> 00:56:53,674
I will take you there

1157
00:56:54,301 --> 00:56:57,261
I will show you how

1158
00:57:14,237 --> 00:57:20,075
And, oh, how they danced The
little children of Stonehenge

1159
00:57:21,036 --> 00:57:24,413
Beneath the haunted moon

1160
00:57:25,123 --> 00:57:31,712
For fear that daybreak
might come too soon

1161
00:57:53,735 --> 00:57:56,654
I do not, for one, think that
the problem was that the band was down.

1162
00:57:56,738 --> 00:57:58,322
I think that
the problem may have been

1163
00:57:58,406 --> 00:57:59,949
that there was
a Stonehenge monument

1164
00:58:00,033 --> 00:58:03,828
on the stage that was in danger
of being crushed by a dwarf.

1165
00:58:04,287 --> 00:58:08,249
All right? That tended to understate
the hugeness of the object.

1166
00:58:08,333 --> 00:58:10,751
I really think you're just making
much too big a thing out of it.

1167
00:58:10,836 --> 00:58:13,337
Making a big thing out of it
would have been a good idea.

1168
00:58:13,421 --> 00:58:16,257
Nigel gave me a drawing that
said 18 inches, all right?

1169
00:58:16,341 --> 00:58:17,716
I know he did, and that's
what I'm talking about.

1170
00:58:17,801 --> 00:58:20,344
Whether he knows the difference between
feet and inches is not my problem.

1171
00:58:20,428 --> 00:58:21,470
I do what I'm told.

1172
00:58:21,555 --> 00:58:23,681
But you're not as
confused as him, are you?

1173
00:58:23,765 --> 00:58:26,350
I mean, it's not your job to
be as confused as Nigel is.

1174
00:58:26,434 --> 00:58:27,852
It's my job to do
what I'm asked to do

1175
00:58:27,936 --> 00:58:29,728
by the creative
element of this band.

1176
00:58:29,813 --> 00:58:30,980
And that's what I did.

1177
00:58:31,064 --> 00:58:32,565
The audience were laughing.

1178
00:58:32,691 --> 00:58:34,733
So it became a comedy
number. Yes, it did.

1179
00:58:34,818 --> 00:58:36,861
Yes, it fucking well did,
and it was not pleasant

1180
00:58:36,945 --> 00:58:38,696
to be part of
the comedy on stage.

1181
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:41,073
Backstage, perhaps
it was very amusing.

1182
00:58:41,157 --> 00:58:44,785
Maybe we just fix the
choreography, keep the dwarf clear.

1183
00:58:45,328 --> 00:58:47,872
What do you mean?
So he won't trod upon it.

1184
00:58:47,956 --> 00:58:49,415
I don't think
that's the issue.

1185
00:58:49,499 --> 00:58:54,753
I think it's symptomatic that maybe
you're taking on more than you can handle.

1186
00:58:55,505 --> 00:58:58,507
It's not exactly the first time
you've messed things up, is it?

1187
00:58:58,592 --> 00:59:01,051
I mean, there have
been some gaping holes

1188
00:59:01,136 --> 00:59:02,136
in the business
end of this...

1189
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:03,387
Excuse me
for a minute, David.

1190
00:59:03,471 --> 00:59:06,307
Excuse me, this is
a band meeting, right?

1191
00:59:06,433 --> 00:59:08,267
Are you here for some reason?
- Don't worry about it.

1192
00:59:08,351 --> 00:59:09,518
- She's with me.
- Yeah.

1193
00:59:09,603 --> 00:59:11,645
Is she now in the band?
Is she singing backup?

1194
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:14,106
I care what
happens to the band.

1195
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:17,568
David, whenever a single bump or a
ruffle comes into this little fantasy,

1196
00:59:17,652 --> 00:59:20,863
adolescent fantasy world you
guys have built around yourself,

1197
00:59:20,947 --> 00:59:24,408
you start screaming like a
bunch of poncey hairdressers.

1198
00:59:24,492 --> 00:59:27,912
I mean, it's just a problem,
you know? It gets solved.

1199
00:59:27,996 --> 00:59:30,080
It doesn't.
You can't live in a bubble.

1200
00:59:30,165 --> 00:59:32,082
If it got solved,
that would be all right.

1201
00:59:32,167 --> 00:59:33,459
But it doesn't get solved.

1202
00:59:33,543 --> 00:59:35,920
What do you think happened out
there? What got solved tonight?

1203
00:59:36,004 --> 00:59:39,423
The one thing that goes wrong,
one single thing goes wrong,

1204
00:59:39,507 --> 00:59:40,883
100 things go right.

1205
00:59:40,967 --> 00:59:42,927
Do you know what I spend
my time doing? What?

1206
00:59:43,011 --> 00:59:45,012
I sleep two or
three hours a night.

1207
00:59:45,138 --> 00:59:47,097
There's no sex and
drugs for Ian, David.

1208
00:59:47,182 --> 00:59:49,475
You know what I do?
I find lost luggage.

1209
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:52,436
I locate mandolin strings
in the middle of Austin!

1210
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,439
I pries the rent out of the
local Hebrews. That's what I do.

1211
00:59:55,523 --> 00:59:57,691
Maybe you should get
someone else to find the lost luggage,

1212
00:59:57,776 --> 00:59:59,860
and you should concentrate
on what's going on onstage.

1213
00:59:59,945 --> 01:00:01,320
Yes! That's
what we're talking about.

1214
01:00:01,363 --> 01:00:02,863
You'd like me to be the
road manager? All bad... No!

1215
01:00:02,948 --> 01:00:04,907
All bad... Could we...

1216
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:09,036
What David's trying to say, if
you'll let him get a word through,

1217
01:00:10,038 --> 01:00:12,665
is you could maybe
do with some help.

1218
01:00:13,583 --> 01:00:15,918
Some help? It's very
simple, it's very simple.

1219
01:00:16,002 --> 01:00:16,961
It's that clear.

1220
01:00:17,045 --> 01:00:19,421
Maybe there's someone
already in the organization.

1221
01:00:19,506 --> 01:00:20,673
We don't have
to pay insurance.

1222
01:00:20,757 --> 01:00:22,508
We don't have to
pay extra room, et cetera.

1223
01:00:22,592 --> 01:00:24,802
Since she's already here,
she's already among us,

1224
01:00:24,886 --> 01:00:26,220
and she can...
- She?

1225
01:00:26,346 --> 01:00:28,472
She's perfectly capable
to taking over. She?

1226
01:00:28,598 --> 01:00:30,391
Wait a minute! Well, who do
you think I'm talking about?

1227
01:00:30,517 --> 01:00:32,476
Who do you think I'm talking
about? I would never have dreamed

1228
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,311
in a million years, that it
was her you were talking about.

1229
01:00:34,396 --> 01:00:35,479
Why not?

1230
01:00:35,563 --> 01:00:37,523
I am offering to help out.

1231
01:00:37,607 --> 01:00:38,732
No, you're not
offering to help out.

1232
01:00:38,817 --> 01:00:40,693
You're offering to co-manage
the band with me, is that it?

1233
01:00:40,777 --> 01:00:41,819
Yes.
Let's get it straight...

1234
01:00:41,903 --> 01:00:42,987
In so many words,
that is exactly it.

1235
01:00:43,071 --> 01:00:44,071
Exactly.

1236
01:00:44,155 --> 01:00:46,156
Well, I'm certainly not going
to co-manage with some girl

1237
01:00:46,241 --> 01:00:47,324
just because
she's your girlfriend.

1238
01:00:47,409 --> 01:00:48,659
His girlfriend, is it?
Don't call her my girlfriend.

1239
01:00:48,743 --> 01:00:50,244
All right, she's not
your girlfriend. I don't know.

1240
01:00:50,328 --> 01:00:51,662
You couldn't manage
a classroom full of kids.

1241
01:00:51,746 --> 01:00:52,913
I don't know what you're
doing managing the band.

1242
01:00:52,998 --> 01:00:54,456
Why don't we just...
Shut up!

1243
01:00:54,541 --> 01:00:57,209
Look, look. I...
This is my position, okay?

1244
01:00:57,293 --> 01:00:58,752
I am not
managing it with you...

1245
01:00:58,878 --> 01:01:00,963
Good. ...or any other woman,
especially one who dresses

1246
01:01:01,047 --> 01:01:03,340
Like an Australian's
nightmare. So, fuck you.

1247
01:01:03,425 --> 01:01:04,508
Well, fuck you, too.
Fuck all of you,

1248
01:01:04,592 --> 01:01:06,343
because I quit.
All right?

1249
01:01:06,428 --> 01:01:07,928
That's it.
Good night.

1250
01:01:17,731 --> 01:01:20,107
Can I raise a practical
question at this point?

1251
01:01:20,191 --> 01:01:21,608
Yeah.

1252
01:01:21,735 --> 01:01:23,152
Are we gonna do
Stonehenge tomorrow?

1253
01:01:23,611 --> 01:01:26,405
No, we're not gonna
fucking do Stonehenge!

1254
01:01:27,323 --> 01:01:29,616
Okay, we're all set.
Thank you.

1255
01:01:30,201 --> 01:01:31,994
All right, fellas,
I've got the tickets.

1256
01:01:32,078 --> 01:01:35,414
We're on the 3:10 flight
at Gate 24.

1257
01:01:35,498 --> 01:01:38,375
All right? And this
arrives at 4:00 in Colorado.

1258
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:41,045
Then we got a limo
to take us to the lodge.

1259
01:01:41,129 --> 01:01:44,048
It's about 100 yards
from Rainbow Trout Studio.

1260
01:01:44,132 --> 01:01:48,385
What I've done is to arrange
a whole load of charts.

1261
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:50,054
Wait till you see this.
This is so great.

1262
01:01:50,138 --> 01:01:53,474
Now, I know that
the band's sign is Virgo

1263
01:01:53,558 --> 01:01:56,560
and, you see it,
Saturn's in the third house,

1264
01:01:56,644 --> 01:01:58,687
all right,
and it's a bit rocky.

1265
01:01:58,772 --> 01:02:04,693
But because Virgo is one of the most
highly intelligent signs of the zodiac,

1266
01:02:04,778 --> 01:02:07,237
we're gonna pull through
this with great aplomb.

1267
01:02:07,322 --> 01:02:08,947
Yeah. And has someone not got one?

1268
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:10,741
It's so clear. Really is. Nigel
hasn't got one. Here you go.

1269
01:02:10,825 --> 01:02:12,076
It's so clear.
Nigel.

1270
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,454
Nigel! I've got pages for
you. I think Nigel has one.

1271
01:02:15,538 --> 01:02:17,164
He's got one.
He's got it.

1272
01:02:17,248 --> 01:02:18,248
If you have
a look at this...

1273
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:20,876
If you think about the jumble
the tour book usually is...

1274
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,044
No, he's got one.
He's got one.

1275
01:02:22,128 --> 01:02:23,170
He's got one?
All right.

1276
01:02:23,254 --> 01:02:24,379
And what's all this
on the...

1277
01:02:24,464 --> 01:02:26,465
Now, what I want to explain
to you here, is that Denver...

1278
01:02:26,925 --> 01:02:31,428
How would you characterize your
relationship with David over the years?

1279
01:02:31,513 --> 01:02:33,555
Has it changed in any way?

1280
01:02:33,681 --> 01:02:35,724
Not really. I mean, you know, they go...

1281
01:02:35,809 --> 01:02:37,518
We've grown up.

1282
01:02:38,394 --> 01:02:41,355
But, really, it's not...
No, not really.

1283
01:02:42,065 --> 01:02:46,026
We feel like children much of
the time, even when we're playing.

1284
01:02:46,611 --> 01:02:48,695
We're closer than brothers.

1285
01:02:50,073 --> 01:02:51,949
Brothers always fight.

1286
01:02:52,075 --> 01:02:53,992
Sort of disagreements
and all that.

1287
01:02:55,370 --> 01:02:59,540
We really have a relationship
that's way, way past that.

1288
01:03:05,547 --> 01:03:06,755
He can't play
the fucking guitar anymore.

1289
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:07,881
You know the parts.

1290
01:03:07,966 --> 01:03:09,258
You did it this morning.
No, he doesn't know the...

1291
01:03:09,342 --> 01:03:11,802
If he knew the fucking part,
he'd play it, wouldn't he?

1292
01:03:11,886 --> 01:03:13,262
That's it.
- Are you walking out?

1293
01:03:13,346 --> 01:03:14,763
Fuck. I'm not planning on walking out.

1294
01:03:14,848 --> 01:03:16,014
Great.
Just tell me

1295
01:03:16,099 --> 01:03:17,224
what I'm supposed to do,
all right?

1296
01:03:17,308 --> 01:03:19,518
Well, we're supposed to play
the fucking thing, aren't we?

1297
01:03:19,602 --> 01:03:21,395
We have no choice.
We spent an hour and half...

1298
01:03:21,479 --> 01:03:22,813
Well, I'm doing my part.
...setting up this...

1299
01:03:22,897 --> 01:03:24,314
You know what would
make this a lot simpler?

1300
01:03:24,399 --> 01:03:26,608
I mean, I hate to
cut right to it here.

1301
01:03:26,734 --> 01:03:28,277
Why don't you
play this alone,

1302
01:03:28,361 --> 01:03:30,195
without some fucking angel
hanging over your head,

1303
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,655
you know what I mean?

1304
01:03:31,739 --> 01:03:34,283
Jesus Christ.
This is fucking all we need.

1305
01:03:34,534 --> 01:03:37,327
You can't fucking concentrate
because of your fucking wife.

1306
01:03:37,412 --> 01:03:38,537
Simple as that, all right?

1307
01:03:38,621 --> 01:03:39,705
It's your fucking wife.

1308
01:03:39,789 --> 01:03:40,831
She's not my wife.

1309
01:03:40,915 --> 01:03:42,332
Well, whatever the
fuck she is, all right?

1310
01:03:42,417 --> 01:03:43,792
You can't concentrate.

1311
01:03:43,877 --> 01:03:45,627
We can't fucking do that
track. This is unbelievable.

1312
01:03:45,753 --> 01:03:47,713
This is unbelievable. No,
it's not unbelievable at all.

1313
01:03:47,797 --> 01:03:49,173
Will you check me on this?
It all leads up to this.

1314
01:03:49,257 --> 01:03:51,008
Am I losing my fucking mind?
It all leads up to this.

1315
01:03:51,092 --> 01:03:52,885
Can you check me on this?
Am I losing my mind?

1316
01:03:52,969 --> 01:03:55,888
I don't understand what
this has to do with anything.

1317
01:03:56,181 --> 01:03:58,098
We're very lucky
in the sense that

1318
01:03:58,183 --> 01:04:00,684
we've got two visionaries
in the band.

1319
01:04:01,186 --> 01:04:04,188
You know, David and Nigel
- Right.

1320
01:04:04,939 --> 01:04:06,023
...like poets, you know.

1321
01:04:06,107 --> 01:04:08,233
Like Shelley or Byron
or people like that.

1322
01:04:08,318 --> 01:04:11,361
They're two totally distinct
types of visionaries.

1323
01:04:11,446 --> 01:04:13,864
It's like fire and ice,
basically, you see,

1324
01:04:13,948 --> 01:04:15,866
and I feel my role
is to, in the band,

1325
01:04:15,950 --> 01:04:17,451
is to be kind of
in the middle of that.

1326
01:04:17,535 --> 01:04:19,453
Kind of like lukewarm water, in a sense.

1327
01:04:27,712 --> 01:04:29,880
Listen, I don't think we've
got time to go to the hotel.

1328
01:04:29,964 --> 01:04:31,548
I think you better go
straight to the base.

1329
01:04:31,633 --> 01:04:32,674
To the what?

1330
01:04:32,759 --> 01:04:34,092
Base?
The gig.

1331
01:04:34,219 --> 01:04:35,886
Yeah, to the base. DEREK:
To the Civic Arena, right?

1332
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:36,970
Yeah.
No!

1333
01:04:37,055 --> 01:04:38,180
No, that fell through.

1334
01:04:38,264 --> 01:04:39,431
We had it.
What do you mean?

1335
01:04:39,515 --> 01:04:40,849
Wait a second.
Hold it, hold it.

1336
01:04:40,934 --> 01:04:43,310
What do you... Do you know about
this and we don't know about this?

1337
01:04:43,394 --> 01:04:44,519
What are you talking about?

1338
01:04:44,604 --> 01:04:45,896
We're going
to the Air Force base.

1339
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:47,648
Why are we going
to an Air Force base?

1340
01:04:47,732 --> 01:04:50,150
'Cause the original gig
fell through.

1341
01:04:55,448 --> 01:04:57,407
Lieutenant Hookstratten?
Hookstratten.

1342
01:04:57,492 --> 01:04:58,742
You are Spinal Tarp?

1343
01:04:58,826 --> 01:05:01,411
I'm Jeanine Pettibone
and this is Spinal Tap.

1344
01:05:01,496 --> 01:05:02,913
Spinal Tap, my mistake.

1345
01:05:02,997 --> 01:05:04,498
I'm Lieutenant
Bob Hookstratten.

1346
01:05:04,582 --> 01:05:06,583
Welcome to Lindberg
Air Force Base.

1347
01:05:06,668 --> 01:05:09,127
Is this your gentlemen's first
visit to a military facility?

1348
01:05:09,212 --> 01:05:11,004
Yeah.
Fine, may I start by saying

1349
01:05:11,089 --> 01:05:12,756
how thrilled we are
to have you here?

1350
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,508
We are such
fans of your music

1351
01:05:14,634 --> 01:05:16,301
and all of your records.
- That's great.

1352
01:05:16,386 --> 01:05:17,970
I'm not speaking
of yours personally,

1353
01:05:18,054 --> 01:05:19,596
but the whole genre
of the rock 'n' roll.

1354
01:05:19,681 --> 01:05:20,722
- I understand that.
- Yeah.

1355
01:05:20,807 --> 01:05:21,932
And so many of
the exciting things

1356
01:05:22,016 --> 01:05:23,058
that are happening
in music today.

1357
01:05:23,142 --> 01:05:24,226
And let me explain a bit
about what's going on.

1358
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:27,187
This is our monthly
"at-ease weekend."

1359
01:05:27,438 --> 01:05:29,231
It gives us a chance
to kind of let down our hair.

1360
01:05:29,357 --> 01:05:31,942
Although, I see you
all have a head start on that.

1361
01:05:32,026 --> 01:05:34,486
These haircuts wouldn't pass
military muster, believe me.

1362
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:35,862
Although,
I shouldn't talk.

1363
01:05:35,947 --> 01:05:37,197
My hair's getting
a little shaggy, too.

1364
01:05:37,282 --> 01:05:38,448
Better not get
too close to you.

1365
01:05:38,533 --> 01:05:39,616
They'll think I'm
part of the band.

1366
01:05:39,701 --> 01:05:40,909
I'm joking, of course.

1367
01:05:40,994 --> 01:05:42,160
Shall we go in,
and I'll show you around?

1368
01:05:42,912 --> 01:05:45,580
Walk this way,
please. Right through here.

1369
01:05:45,665 --> 01:05:48,125
Did you ever run into a musical
group, works out of Kansas City,

1370
01:05:48,209 --> 01:05:50,085
calls himself Four
Jacks and a Jill?

1371
01:05:50,211 --> 01:05:52,087
They've been at a Ramada Inn
there for about 18 months.

1372
01:05:52,171 --> 01:05:55,007
If you're ever in Kansas City and
you want to hear some good music,

1373
01:05:55,091 --> 01:05:57,134
you might want
to drop by.

1374
01:05:57,719 --> 01:06:00,345
I would like to
get the playing on

1375
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:03,056
about 19:00 hours if
that's satisfactory.

1376
01:06:03,308 --> 01:06:04,558
When will that be?

1377
01:06:04,642 --> 01:06:07,144
I make it now,
it's about 18:30 hours.

1378
01:06:07,228 --> 01:06:08,520
So, that's what?
50 hours?

1379
01:06:08,604 --> 01:06:09,896
120 hours?

1380
01:06:10,189 --> 01:06:11,857
That's actually
about 30 minutes.

1381
01:06:11,941 --> 01:06:13,233
About a half hour,
give or take just

1382
01:06:13,318 --> 01:06:14,568
a few minutes.
I don't want to rush you.

1383
01:06:14,652 --> 01:06:17,654
The idea is if we can get it
on, then we get it over with.

1384
01:06:17,739 --> 01:06:18,739
And I have
just one request.

1385
01:06:18,823 --> 01:06:21,033
Would you play a couple of
slow numbers so I can dance?

1386
01:06:21,451 --> 01:06:23,910
Working on a sex farm

1387
01:06:25,747 --> 01:06:28,832
Plowing through
your bean field

1388
01:06:30,001 --> 01:06:32,210
Getting out my pitchfork

1389
01:06:34,255 --> 01:06:36,423
Poking your hay

1390
01:06:38,551 --> 01:06:42,679
Sex farm woman
I'm gonna mow you down

1391
01:06:42,764 --> 01:06:46,683
Sex farm woman
I'll rake and hoe you down

1392
01:06:46,809 --> 01:06:48,769
Sex farm woman

1393
01:06:48,853 --> 01:06:54,900
Don't you see my silo
rising high? High, high

1394
01:07:06,662 --> 01:07:08,330
All units,
re-bay at the airport.

1395
01:07:08,414 --> 01:07:10,040
We need to know
your vicinity.

1396
01:07:12,168 --> 01:07:13,877
...light speed...

1397
01:07:13,961 --> 01:07:16,380
...just hitting the bend.
52-49...

1398
01:07:16,464 --> 01:07:19,091
Working on a sex farm

1399
01:07:20,134 --> 01:07:21,301
But today...

1400
01:07:21,386 --> 01:07:23,512
Trying to raise
some hard love

1401
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:27,808
Getting out
my pitchfork

1402
01:07:27,892 --> 01:07:29,726
And you
talk to one guy for like...

1403
01:07:29,811 --> 01:07:31,812
Poking your hay

1404
01:07:32,563 --> 01:07:34,356
Annie and I
are crying about the wire line

1405
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,358
on our story, you know...

1406
01:07:36,859 --> 01:07:38,902
He totally
ruined the gig, there.

1407
01:07:38,986 --> 01:07:40,529
And he walks off
and then, you know...

1408
01:07:40,655 --> 01:07:43,573
I mean, he can't be expected
to sit at home and get monies.

1409
01:07:43,658 --> 01:07:45,200
We've got to get
someone else in there.

1410
01:07:45,284 --> 01:07:46,660
Has he ever done
this before? Has he ever...

1411
01:07:46,744 --> 01:07:48,078
Well, no, but...
...quit the band before?

1412
01:07:48,162 --> 01:07:49,746
Well, no, but it's...

1413
01:07:49,831 --> 01:07:51,289
You've got to
understand that, like,

1414
01:07:51,374 --> 01:07:53,250
in the world of
rock 'n' roll there are

1415
01:07:53,334 --> 01:07:55,627
certain changes
that sometimes occur,

1416
01:07:56,671 --> 01:07:58,046
and you've just
got to, sort of,

1417
01:07:58,131 --> 01:07:59,423
roll with them, you know.
I mean, this...

1418
01:07:59,507 --> 01:08:01,383
You've read...
You read that... You know,

1419
01:08:01,467 --> 01:08:02,801
you saw exactly
how many people

1420
01:08:02,885 --> 01:08:04,219
have been in this
band over the years.

1421
01:08:04,303 --> 01:08:07,097
Thirty-seven people have been
in this band over the years.

1422
01:08:07,181 --> 01:08:09,266
I mean, it's like, you know,
six months from now,

1423
01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:13,186
I can't see myself missing
Nige any more than I might miss

1424
01:08:13,479 --> 01:08:15,605
Ross MacLochness
or Ronnie Pudding

1425
01:08:15,731 --> 01:08:17,858
or Denny Upham or
Little Danny Schindler,

1426
01:08:17,942 --> 01:08:19,109
any of those, you know.

1427
01:08:19,193 --> 01:08:20,360
I can't believe that.

1428
01:08:20,445 --> 01:08:22,737
I can't believe that,
you know,

1429
01:08:23,322 --> 01:08:25,198
you're lumping Nigel in with

1430
01:08:26,117 --> 01:08:28,785
these people you played with
for short periods of time.

1431
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:30,120
Well, I'm sure I'd feel
much worse

1432
01:08:30,204 --> 01:08:32,038
if I weren't under
such heavy sedation,

1433
01:08:32,123 --> 01:08:33,832
but still, in all, I mean,

1434
01:08:33,916 --> 01:08:37,127
you've got to be realistic about
this sort of thing, you know.

1435
01:08:37,211 --> 01:08:39,546
So what happens
to the band now?

1436
01:08:40,214 --> 01:08:41,298
What do you mean?

1437
01:08:41,382 --> 01:08:42,340
Well, this is...
He's not coming back? Or...

1438
01:08:42,425 --> 01:08:44,885
No, we shan't
work together again.

1439
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:55,645
- Oh, no.
- Great.

1440
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:59,274
If I told them once, I
told them a hundred times,

1441
01:08:59,525 --> 01:09:02,819
put Spinal Tap first
and puppet show last.

1442
01:09:02,904 --> 01:09:05,238
It's a morale builder,
isn't it?

1443
01:09:05,364 --> 01:09:07,073
You've got a big dressing
room, though. What?

1444
01:09:07,158 --> 01:09:08,950
It's all right. You know,
you've got the big dressing room.

1445
01:09:09,035 --> 01:09:10,619
We got a bigger dressing
room than the puppets?

1446
01:09:10,703 --> 01:09:11,995
The Muppet Show.
That's refreshing.

1447
01:09:12,371 --> 01:09:14,581
I've got some of this
Mendocino Rocket Fuel

1448
01:09:14,665 --> 01:09:15,874
that's supposed
to be really nice.

1449
01:09:15,958 --> 01:09:17,167
Can you play...

1450
01:09:17,251 --> 01:09:20,337
Excuse me, Viv.
Can you play a bass line

1451
01:09:20,421 --> 01:09:22,464
like Nigel used
to on Big Bottom?

1452
01:09:22,548 --> 01:09:23,715
Can you double that?
Yeah.

1453
01:09:23,799 --> 01:09:25,300
You might recall the line,
it's in fifths.

1454
01:09:25,384 --> 01:09:27,844
Oh yeah, I've got two
hands here. I can do it.

1455
01:09:27,929 --> 01:09:29,346
Great. So that's
good. We can play that one.

1456
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:30,597
All right, that's it.
Hole is out.

1457
01:09:30,681 --> 01:09:31,765
Heavy is out.

1458
01:09:31,891 --> 01:09:33,767
Heavy, Hole, Heavy, Hole...
Right, right, right. We know.

1459
01:09:33,851 --> 01:09:35,602
America we know is out.
America we can't do.

1460
01:09:35,686 --> 01:09:36,686
That's Nigel's tune.
That's not my tune.

1461
01:09:36,771 --> 01:09:37,687
We know, we know.

1462
01:09:37,772 --> 01:09:38,855
That's a nice
little set, isn't it?

1463
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:40,857
That's a cozy 10 minutes.

1464
01:09:40,942 --> 01:09:42,359
What we gonna do?
We got nothing to play here.

1465
01:09:42,443 --> 01:09:43,527
We got nothing.

1466
01:09:43,611 --> 01:09:44,778
I'll tell you what
we're gonna have to do.

1467
01:09:44,862 --> 01:09:45,987
What?

1468
01:09:46,113 --> 01:09:47,280
Jazz Odyssey.

1469
01:09:47,698 --> 01:09:52,202
We're not going about to do
a free-form jazz exploration

1470
01:09:52,286 --> 01:09:53,995
in front of a festival crowd.

1471
01:09:55,122 --> 01:10:00,627
You are witnesses at the new
birth of Spinal Tap Mark ll.

1472
01:10:03,339 --> 01:10:05,757
Hope you enjoy
our new direction.

1473
01:10:26,404 --> 01:10:30,198
On the bass, Derek Smalls.
He wrote this.

1474
01:10:39,542 --> 01:10:40,917
So, tonight's
the last show of the tour.

1475
01:10:41,002 --> 01:10:42,085
How's that feel?

1476
01:10:42,169 --> 01:10:43,753
You know, is this,
like, your last waltz?

1477
01:10:43,838 --> 01:10:45,463
Are we talking
the end of Spinal Tap?

1478
01:10:45,548 --> 01:10:47,132
Or are you going to
try to milk it for

1479
01:10:47,216 --> 01:10:48,758
a few more years
in Europe? I mean...

1480
01:10:48,843 --> 01:10:53,763
Well, I don't, I don't really
think that the end can be assessed,

1481
01:10:54,348 --> 01:10:57,183
as of itself,
as being the end,

1482
01:10:57,268 --> 01:10:58,852
because what does
the end feel like?

1483
01:10:58,936 --> 01:11:02,647
It's like saying when you try and
extrapolate the end of the universe.

1484
01:11:02,732 --> 01:11:05,984
If you say the end... If the
universe is indeed infinite,

1485
01:11:06,068 --> 01:11:07,360
then how...
What does that mean?

1486
01:11:07,445 --> 01:11:09,446
How far is all the way?

1487
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:11,156
And then if it stops,
what's stopping it,

1488
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:12,824
and what's behind
what's stopping it?

1489
01:11:12,867 --> 01:11:15,368
So, "What's the end,"
you know... Mmm-hmm.

1490
01:11:15,453 --> 01:11:16,786
...is my question
to you.

1491
01:11:17,246 --> 01:11:18,413
It's a good crowd.
Good crowd.

1492
01:11:18,497 --> 01:11:19,623
It is, isn't it?

1493
01:11:19,707 --> 01:11:22,042
Yeah, it really is. I mean, you
know, some of these things just...

1494
01:11:22,126 --> 01:11:24,336
Well, it's hard to get at
the last minute, you know?

1495
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:27,464
You can't arrange
it all overnight.

1496
01:11:27,548 --> 01:11:29,966
David, we had
a 15-year ride, mate.

1497
01:11:30,051 --> 01:11:32,761
I mean, who wants to be a fucking
45-year-old rock 'n' roller

1498
01:11:32,845 --> 01:11:35,347
farting around in front of
people less than half their age?

1499
01:11:35,431 --> 01:11:36,473
That is so true, yeah.

1500
01:11:36,557 --> 01:11:39,726
Cranking out some kind of
mediocre head-banging bullshit,

1501
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:40,810
you know,
that we forgot...

1502
01:11:40,895 --> 01:11:41,895
Yeah, well,
it's beneath us.

1503
01:11:41,979 --> 01:11:42,937
That's right.

1504
01:11:43,022 --> 01:11:44,481
Who wants to see it?
Absolutely right.

1505
01:11:44,565 --> 01:11:45,940
Not me. I mean, you can
take all those projects

1506
01:11:46,025 --> 01:11:47,359
that we thought,
you know, we didn't...

1507
01:11:47,443 --> 01:11:48,818
Oh, there's dozens,
they're so...

1508
01:11:48,903 --> 01:11:51,363
You know, we didn't have
time for them because of Tap,

1509
01:11:51,447 --> 01:11:53,073
and bring them
back to life, maybe.

1510
01:11:53,157 --> 01:11:54,616
Do you remember what we
were... Do you remember...

1511
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:58,662
At the Luton Palace, we were
talking about a rock musical

1512
01:11:58,746 --> 01:11:59,996
based on the life
of Jack the Ripper.

1513
01:12:00,081 --> 01:12:02,082
Yeah, Saucy Jack.
Right, Saucy Jack.

1514
01:12:02,166 --> 01:12:03,166
Saucy Jack.
Now's the time to do that.

1515
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:05,669
You're
a naughty one, Saucy Jack

1516
01:12:05,753 --> 01:12:08,129
You're a haughty one,
Saucy Jack

1517
01:12:08,255 --> 01:12:09,964
Right. Bit of freeing up, isn't it?

1518
01:12:10,049 --> 01:12:12,008
It's all this free time is...
Suddenly, time is so elastic.

1519
01:12:12,093 --> 01:12:14,344
It's a gift.
It's a gift of freedom.

1520
01:12:14,428 --> 01:12:18,306
I've always wanted to do a
collection of my acoustic numbers

1521
01:12:18,391 --> 01:12:21,184
with the London Philharmonic,
as you know.

1522
01:12:21,268 --> 01:12:22,394
We're lucky.
Yeah.

1523
01:12:22,478 --> 01:12:25,105
I mean, people should be, people
should be envying us, you know.

1524
01:12:25,189 --> 01:12:26,481
I envy us.
Yeah.

1525
01:12:26,565 --> 01:12:27,691
I do.
Me, too.

1526
01:12:35,783 --> 01:12:37,826
It's gonna be fine,
right?

1527
01:12:39,412 --> 01:12:40,704
We'll make them
miss us.

1528
01:12:40,788 --> 01:12:42,163
Nice thought.

1529
01:12:44,625 --> 01:12:45,834
I'm in.

1530
01:12:46,168 --> 01:12:47,627
I'm in tune.

1531
01:12:47,962 --> 01:12:49,421
Come on, The last tuning.
Let's go in.

1532
01:12:49,547 --> 01:12:51,381
I think we should go
in, huh? The last tuning.

1533
01:12:51,507 --> 01:12:53,341
I think it's
time to go, right?

1534
01:12:54,176 --> 01:12:55,260
Can we go?

1535
01:12:55,553 --> 01:12:56,469
Yeah.

1536
01:12:57,096 --> 01:13:00,765
All right, we're going to
do a good show, a dynamite show.

1537
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:18,324
Come to see the show?

1538
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:20,285
Yeah.

1539
01:13:20,661 --> 01:13:22,328
Hi, Mick.
Nige.

1540
01:13:27,042 --> 01:13:29,210
So, did you just come here
to hang around backstage,

1541
01:13:29,295 --> 01:13:30,378
like a real
rock 'n' roller?

1542
01:13:30,463 --> 01:13:31,755
Is that what
you're doing?

1543
01:13:31,839 --> 01:13:33,798
I'm really a messenger.

1544
01:13:33,924 --> 01:13:35,425
Oh, a messenger? Yeah.

1545
01:13:35,509 --> 01:13:37,010
I bumped into Ian, and...

1546
01:13:37,094 --> 01:13:38,386
Ian? Ian?

1547
01:13:39,138 --> 01:13:41,347
Oh, the other dead man, yeah.

1548
01:13:41,474 --> 01:13:45,935
Seems that Sex Farm
is on the charts in Japan.

1549
01:13:46,771 --> 01:13:48,688
Spinal Tap's
recording, Sex Farm?

1550
01:13:48,773 --> 01:13:51,983
It's number five
last week, actually, and...

1551
01:13:52,067 --> 01:13:54,027
So, he...

1552
01:13:54,653 --> 01:13:59,199
He asked me
to ask you, Tap,

1553
01:14:00,409 --> 01:14:06,623
if you'd be interested in
reforming and doing a tour, Japan.

1554
01:14:07,374 --> 01:14:09,083
So you've come
back to re-plug

1555
01:14:09,168 --> 01:14:10,794
our life-support
systems in, is that it?

1556
01:14:10,878 --> 01:14:13,129
By the grace
of your...

1557
01:14:13,214 --> 01:14:14,964
By the stroke of your hand,
you're going to set us...

1558
01:14:15,049 --> 01:14:16,174
Is that what
you're going to do?

1559
01:14:16,258 --> 01:14:17,383
You gonna bring
us back to life?

1560
01:14:17,426 --> 01:14:18,885
That what you've come
here for? No, I've come...

1561
01:14:18,969 --> 01:14:19,969
I mean, it's...
Don't you...

1562
01:14:20,054 --> 01:14:24,057
The fucking nerve that
you display in coming...

1563
01:14:24,141 --> 01:14:25,892
No, that's...

1564
01:14:26,018 --> 01:14:28,061
I'm just passing on
the information, really.

1565
01:14:29,063 --> 01:14:30,980
Yeah, well, I think it's time to go in.

1566
01:14:31,065 --> 01:14:32,899
We haven't got time
to discuss this now.

1567
01:14:32,983 --> 01:14:34,234
Come on.

1568
01:14:37,738 --> 01:14:39,113
All right?

1569
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:02,262
David...

1570
01:15:03,597 --> 01:15:05,682
Do a good show,
all right?

1571
01:15:06,892 --> 01:15:08,268
Yeah, okay.

1572
01:15:34,962 --> 01:15:36,921
Little girl,
it's a great big world

1573
01:15:37,006 --> 01:15:39,424
But there's only one of me

1574
01:15:40,384 --> 01:15:42,427
You can't touch
'cause I cost too much

1575
01:15:42,511 --> 01:15:44,095
But, tonight,
I'm gonna rock you

1576
01:15:44,179 --> 01:15:45,430
Tonight,
I'm gonna rock you

1577
01:15:45,514 --> 01:15:47,891
Tonight, I'm gonna rock you

1578
01:15:47,975 --> 01:15:49,142
Tonight!

1579
01:15:59,236 --> 01:16:01,279
You're sweet,
but you're just 4 feet

1580
01:16:01,363 --> 01:16:03,823
And you still
got your baby teeth

1581
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,701
You're too young
and I'm too well-hung

1582
01:16:06,785 --> 01:16:08,411
But, tonight,
I'm gonna rock you

1583
01:16:08,495 --> 01:16:09,662
Tonight,
I'm gonna rock you

1584
01:16:09,747 --> 01:16:12,415
Tonight,
I'm gonna rock you

1585
01:16:12,499 --> 01:16:13,708
Tonight!

1586
01:16:15,294 --> 01:16:16,586
Oh, yeah!

1587
01:16:38,943 --> 01:16:41,527
Nigel Tufnel,
lead guitar!

1588
01:17:04,927 --> 01:17:06,803
You're hot,
you take all we got

1589
01:17:06,971 --> 01:17:09,097
Not a dry seat in the house

1590
01:17:10,182 --> 01:17:12,225
Next day,
we'll be on our way

1591
01:17:12,309 --> 01:17:13,685
But, tonight,
I'm gonna rock you

1592
01:17:14,853 --> 01:17:16,270
Yeah, tonight,
we're gonna rock you

1593
01:17:16,355 --> 01:17:17,480
Tonight, I'm gonna rock you

1594
01:17:17,564 --> 01:17:18,773
Tonight!

1595
01:17:28,117 --> 01:17:30,076
Little girl,
it's a great big world

1596
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:32,078
But there's only one of

1597
01:17:33,789 --> 01:17:37,000
Me!

1598
01:17:52,850 --> 01:17:57,353
Do you feel that playing rock
'n' roll music keeps you a child?

1599
01:17:57,938 --> 01:18:01,190
That is, keeps you in a state
of arrested development?

1600
01:18:01,275 --> 01:18:03,651
No, no.
No, I feel it's like...

1601
01:18:03,736 --> 01:18:07,321
It's more like going to a
national park or something,

1602
01:18:07,406 --> 01:18:09,866
and there's, you know,
they preserve the moose.

1603
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:11,951
And that's my
childhood up there

1604
01:18:12,036 --> 01:18:14,037
on stage,
is that moose, you know?

1605
01:18:14,121 --> 01:18:16,372
So, when you're playing, you feel
like a preserved moose on stage?

1606
01:18:16,457 --> 01:18:17,457
Yeah.

1607
01:18:17,541 --> 01:18:18,708
I've been listening
to the classics.

1608
01:18:18,792 --> 01:18:21,294
I belong to a
great series.

1609
01:18:22,129 --> 01:18:24,672
It's called the Namesake
Series, of cassettes.

1610
01:18:24,757 --> 01:18:26,883
And they send you the works
of famous authors

1611
01:18:26,967 --> 01:18:29,677
done by actors with
the same last name.

1612
01:18:30,012 --> 01:18:33,514
So I've got Denholm Elliott
reading T.S. Eliot on this one.

1613
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:35,183
Well, that's interesting. Yes.

1614
01:18:35,267 --> 01:18:37,226
I've got Danny Thomas
doing A Child's

1615
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:39,228
Christmas in
Wales by Dylan Thomas.

1616
01:18:39,313 --> 01:18:44,484
And next month, it's McLean Stevenson
reads Robert Louis Stevenson.

1617
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:46,194
Treasure Island,
I believe.

1618
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,154
That's interesting.
That's fascinating. Yeah.

1619
01:18:48,238 --> 01:18:49,489
There's also something...

1620
01:18:49,573 --> 01:18:51,908
There's a shorter works
of Washington Irving

1621
01:18:51,992 --> 01:18:54,243
read by someone
called Dr. J.

1622
01:18:54,328 --> 01:18:56,037
Oh, that's
Julius Erving.

1623
01:18:56,163 --> 01:18:57,872
There you go. Julius Erving,
the basketball player.

1624
01:18:57,956 --> 01:18:59,082
In keeping with
the series, yeah.

1625
01:18:59,166 --> 01:19:00,249
I didn't know that.

1626
01:19:00,334 --> 01:19:01,334
You like this?

1627
01:19:01,418 --> 01:19:02,585
It's very nice.
It looks like Halloween.

1628
01:19:02,669 --> 01:19:06,839
This is my exact inner
structure, done in a T-shirt.

1629
01:19:07,591 --> 01:19:09,967
Exactly medically accurate.
See?

1630
01:19:10,511 --> 01:19:12,011
So, in other words,
if we were to

1631
01:19:12,096 --> 01:19:13,721
take all your
flesh and blood...

1632
01:19:13,806 --> 01:19:15,264
Take them off.
And you'd see...

1633
01:19:15,349 --> 01:19:16,682
This is what you'd see.

1634
01:19:16,767 --> 01:19:18,059
It wouldn't be
green, though.

1635
01:19:18,143 --> 01:19:19,519
It is green.

1636
01:19:19,603 --> 01:19:22,105
You know, see how
your blood looks blue?

1637
01:19:22,189 --> 01:19:23,481
Yeah, well,
that's just the vein,

1638
01:19:23,565 --> 01:19:24,941
I mean, the color
of the vein, I mean.

1639
01:19:25,025 --> 01:19:26,317
The blood is actually red.

1640
01:19:26,401 --> 01:19:28,027
Oh, maybe
it's not green, then.

1641
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:30,154
Anyway, this is what I
sleep in sometimes. Yeah.

1642
01:19:30,405 --> 01:19:32,406
Denis Eton-Hogg,
the president

1643
01:19:32,491 --> 01:19:35,409
of Polymer Records,
was recently knighted.

1644
01:19:35,744 --> 01:19:38,955
What were the circumstances
surrounding his knighthood?

1645
01:19:39,039 --> 01:19:40,790
The specific reason
why he was knighted

1646
01:19:40,874 --> 01:19:43,209
was for the founding
of Hoggwood,

1647
01:19:43,919 --> 01:19:47,213
which is a summer camp
for pale young boys.

1648
01:19:49,842 --> 01:19:51,259
David St. Hubbins,

1649
01:19:51,343 --> 01:19:53,761
I must admit, I've never heard
of anybody with that name.

1650
01:19:53,846 --> 01:19:55,012
It's an unusual name.

1651
01:19:55,097 --> 01:19:56,472
Well, he was
an unusual saint.

1652
01:19:56,557 --> 01:19:58,099
He's not a very
well-known saint.

1653
01:19:58,183 --> 01:19:59,684
Oh, there actually is...
There was a saint Hubbins?

1654
01:19:59,768 --> 01:20:01,144
Oh, yes.
That's right, yes.

1655
01:20:01,228 --> 01:20:02,728
Yeah. What was he the saint of?

1656
01:20:02,813 --> 01:20:05,731
He was the patron saint
of quality footwear.

1657
01:20:05,816 --> 01:20:10,570
You play to predominantly
a white audience.

1658
01:20:10,737 --> 01:20:13,156
Do you feel your music
is racist in any way?

1659
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:15,491
No, not at all.
No, of course not.

1660
01:20:15,576 --> 01:20:17,994
You know, we say,
"Love your brother."

1661
01:20:18,078 --> 01:20:19,370
We don't say it,
really, but...

1662
01:20:19,413 --> 01:20:21,122
We don't literally say
it. No, we don't say it.

1663
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:23,207
We don't really literally mean
it. We don't believe it either.

1664
01:20:23,292 --> 01:20:25,418
But we're not racists.
But...

1665
01:20:25,502 --> 01:20:26,919
That message
should be clear, anyway.

1666
01:20:27,004 --> 01:20:28,379
We're anything
but racists.

1667
01:20:28,463 --> 01:20:29,505
You know,
we've grown musically.

1668
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:30,882
I mean, you listen
to some of the rubbish

1669
01:20:30,966 --> 01:20:33,176
we did early on, it
- Yeah.

1670
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:35,803
You know, now, I mean,
a song like Sex Farm,

1671
01:20:35,888 --> 01:20:38,806
we're taking
a sophisticated

1672
01:20:38,891 --> 01:20:42,268
view of the idea of sex,
you know, and...

1673
01:20:42,686 --> 01:20:44,437
Putting it on a farm.
Yeah.

1674
01:20:44,521 --> 01:20:46,981
If I were to ask you
what your philosophy

1675
01:20:47,065 --> 01:20:49,609
of life or your creed,
what would that be?

1676
01:20:50,652 --> 01:20:55,865
Have a good time
all the time.

1677
01:20:57,659 --> 01:20:59,827
That's my philosophy, Marty.

1678
01:20:59,953 --> 01:21:02,038
I believe virtually
everything I read,

1679
01:21:02,122 --> 01:21:06,542
and I think that is what makes
me more of a selective human

1680
01:21:06,627 --> 01:21:08,711
than someone who doesn't
believe anything.

1681
01:21:08,795 --> 01:21:12,089
Do you have a philosophy
or creed that you live by?

1682
01:21:12,341 --> 01:21:15,301
Well, you know, personally,
I like to think about

1683
01:21:15,385 --> 01:21:17,303
sex and drugs and
rock 'n' roll, you know.

1684
01:21:17,387 --> 01:21:18,387
That's my life.
Yeah.

1685
01:21:18,472 --> 01:21:22,016
If you were to have
something written as your epitaph...

1686
01:21:22,976 --> 01:21:25,645
"Here lies David St. Hubbins,

1687
01:21:28,148 --> 01:21:29,607
"and why not?"

1688
01:21:31,944 --> 01:21:33,694
You feel that
sums up your...

1689
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:35,863
No, it's the first thing I
could think of. Oh, I see.

1690
01:21:35,948 --> 01:21:37,281
It doesn't sum up
anything, really.

1691
01:21:37,366 --> 01:21:38,658
Yeah.

1692
01:21:38,742 --> 01:21:41,494
I'm a real fish nut.
I really like fish.

1693
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:43,329
What kind of fish?

1694
01:21:43,747 --> 01:21:46,040
Well, in the United States,
you have cod.

1695
01:21:46,291 --> 01:21:47,625
I like cod.

1696
01:21:47,709 --> 01:21:50,419
And I love tuna, those
little cans you've got here.

1697
01:21:50,504 --> 01:21:52,171
Tuna fish.
Yeah.

1698
01:21:52,547 --> 01:21:54,048
No bones.
Yeah.

1699
01:21:56,385 --> 01:21:59,595
If you could not play
rock 'n' roll, what would you do?

1700
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:01,764
I'd be a full-time dreamer.

1701
01:22:01,848 --> 01:22:03,849
I'd probably get
a bit stupid and start

1702
01:22:03,976 --> 01:22:05,935
to make a fool of
myself in public,

1703
01:22:06,019 --> 01:22:08,354
'cause there wouldn't
be a stage to go on.

1704
01:22:08,438 --> 01:22:10,606
Probably work with children.

1705
01:22:11,233 --> 01:22:14,193
As long as there's, you know,
sex and drugs,

1706
01:22:14,278 --> 01:22:15,903
I can do without
the rock 'n' roll.

1707
01:22:17,364 --> 01:22:20,574
I suppose I could work
in a shop of some kind,

1708
01:22:20,659 --> 01:22:25,746
or do freelance selling
of some sort of product.

1709
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:27,873
A salesman?
You think...

1710
01:22:27,958 --> 01:22:30,584
A salesman.
Maybe in a haberdasher.

1711
01:22:30,669 --> 01:22:35,464
Or maybe like a
chapeau shop or something.

1712
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:39,969
You know, like, "Would you...
What size do you wear, sir?"

1713
01:22:40,053 --> 01:22:41,053
And then you answer me.

1714
01:22:41,138 --> 01:22:42,638
Seven and a quarter.

1715
01:22:42,723 --> 01:22:44,598
"I think we have that."

1716
01:22:44,725 --> 01:22:46,767
See, something like
that, I could do. Yeah.

1717
01:22:46,852 --> 01:22:48,185
Do you think you'd be happy
doing something...

1718
01:22:48,270 --> 01:22:50,980
"No, we're all out.
Do you wear black?"

1719
01:22:51,064 --> 01:22:53,899
See, that sort of thing I think
I could probably muster up.

1720
01:22:53,984 --> 01:22:56,944
Yeah. Do you think
you'd be happy doing that?

1721
01:22:57,154 --> 01:22:59,405
Well, I don't know.
What are the hours?
