knowing you watched while a guy
like Antony Skomal walked away?

163
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,154
You think I just watched?

164
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,781
If I was a cop
and some guy ran over my wife,

165
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:46,492
I'd be pretty pissed off
if his dad paid his way out of jail.

166
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,495
He killed my mom,
he nearly beat his girlfriend to death,

167
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,123
and you just sit there
saying the same bullshit

168
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,501
-about how people better trust your aim--
-I'm gonna assume you're still raw

169
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,170
by what you saw today at school,

170
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,505
and that's keeping you
from thinking before you speak.

171
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,591
I suggest you stop talking.

172

[thunder rumbles]

173
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:32,497

174

-[Ryuk] Hey, kid.
-Ah!

00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,908
It's pronounced Ree-yook.

184
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,744
Ryuk.

185
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,164
Oh. Hi.

186
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,583
Sorry for the mispronunciation.

187
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,420
Ryuk, what exactly can I do
with this<i></i>Death Note?

188
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,130
What exactly did you have in mind?

189
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,966
Well, it says that I can specify
the manner of death.

190
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,428
If I can choose how they die, does that
mean I can actually control them?

191
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:14,682
Every human spends the last moments
of his life in the shadow of a death god.

192
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:18,352
If we so desire,
we can influence those moments.

193
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,480
There are, of course, limitations.

194
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,440
"Rule 20:

195
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:27,320
A subject can be influenced for no more
than two days leading up to his death."

196
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,989
Two days? Your fingers are huge.

197
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,701
"Rule 28: Each death
must be physically possible,"

198
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,412

while someone's on the toilet.

[laughs]

200
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,540
As much as I love that idea.

201
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,584
Uh, where did it come from?

202
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:45,087
[sighs] The history of the note
is as long as history itself.

203
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,507
But who gave it to me?
I mean, did you give it to me?

204
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:52,053
The last keeper of the note passed away.
It fell to me to find a new one.

205
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,097
-What if I didn't want it?
-You may pass it on.

206
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,517
Or better yet, I will.

207
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,019
-How would you do that?
-I told you!

208
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,564
When the note is separated
from the keeper for seven days,

209
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,483
I find a new one.

210
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,610
Who wrote those warnings about you
in the margins?

211
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:12,198
Oh, is that what we're gonna do
with the note, Light? Rules and warnings?

And we didn't see eye to eye
on everything.

Our friend Kenny.

251
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,924
Oh, yeah.
It's terrible what happened to Kenny.

252
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,014
You don't have to lie to me.
Kenny was a sociopath,

253
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,266
and just because he's dead
does not make it a tragedy.

-Right.
-I just wish I'd seen it.

into a million pieces.

So are you gonna tell me what you saw,
Light Turner?

265
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,425

I'm sorry.

267
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,348
I, uh... thought you could use
some medical attention

268
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,767
and I wasn't aware of the fact
that you were carrying around

269
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,394
a stockpile of illegal papers
in your backpack.

-Do you really want to know?

-Sure.
-Okay, then I'll tell you. I just...

Follow me.

this isn't your poetry journal.

with the "Most Wanted" list.

464
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,209
These guys wanna throw him a parade.

465
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:50,297
But now that rumor has it Kira's a cop,
it's in my world.

466
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:55,176
The idea that Kira is associated
with law enforcement is not a rumor.

467
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,803
It is a fact,

468
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,431
uncovered by the individual I work with.

469
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,017
-Oh, yeah, and who's that?
-He goes by the letter "L."

470
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:03,518
L is real?

471
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:04,769
You're familiar?

472
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,521
Yeah, I hear things.

473
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,899
That giant smuggling ring
in Eastern Europe,

474
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,651
practically handed to police on a platter.

475
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:15,030
L would like to speak with you
regarding the Kira investigation.

476
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,324
-Okay. When?
-Right now.

477
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:28,877
-[L]<i> Hmm, Detective Turner.</i>
-What is this?

478
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,378
<i>A one-time offer.</i>

479
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:33,298
<i>I'd like to assist you</i>
<i>in the capture of Kira.</i>

480
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:37,177
Why me? The FBI, CIA
have hundreds of men on this.

481
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,763
<i>I've been in communication</i>
<i>with Interpol and the FBI,</i>

482
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,223
but I believe you have something
they do not.

483
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,642
<i>What's that?</i>

484
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:46,853
An in-depth understanding
of potential suspects.

485
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,480
<i>Why would I have a better understanding?</i>

486
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,483
The FBI thinks the killer
is operating out of Japan.

487
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,026
<i>Because of the name Kira.</i>

488
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:56,029
Ah, but the name
is an intentional misdirection.

489
00:35:56,613 --> 00:36:00,325
He wants us to believe that he's Japanese,
operating a half a world away.

490
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,620
He's not.

491
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,330
Kira's in Seattle.

492
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:09,084
<i>Shall we help one another?</i>

493

"Justice for the Wicked." What is this?

495
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,562
It's a site for Kira worshipers.

496
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,731
They put up names of people
that deserve to die.

497
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:32,774
[Light] Holy shit.

498
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,359
[Mia] Rapists, pedophiles,

499
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,111
human trafficking, murder.

500
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,655
This guy killed four people
in a house fire.

501
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:41,783
I don't know.
How do we know that it's real?

502
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:42,784
What do you mean?

503
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:46,454
What if somebody fucked your girlfriend
and you put him on the list to kill him?

504
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,249
What would you do if some guy fucked me?

505
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,044
-[stammers] Oh, I'd kill him.
-Yeah?

506
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,546
-Yeah.
-You'd kill him?

507
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:55,547
-Yeah.
-You'd kill him?

508
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,967
But that is the reason why we can't
kill people based on website rumors.

509
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,387
It's not like that.

510
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,432
These are real people with real problems,
and they've been ignored.

511
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:08,685
They need our help.

512
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,722
[L humming]

513
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,147
[Light's father] Figured you'd be older.

514
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:57,066
And that I'd be able to see
more of your face.

515
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:02,405
Yes, well, I find I'm not
in a very trusting mood these days.

516
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:05,742
I took the liberty of moving your evidence
to a more secure location.

517
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,912
Oh, I can see that.
Were you gonna let me know or...?

518
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:13,833
Wow, this is very, very impressive, James.
Your men must be proud.

519
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:16,169
Ask your partner
how my men think about me these days.

520
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,880
So you did all of this yourself?

521
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,966
Even more impressive.

522
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:25,637
Please, James, have a seat.
Rest your glutes.

523
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,852
Mm-mmm. You've made two mistakes.

524
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,356
This is zero day,
Kira's first recorded murders.

525
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:40,068
But previously, on April 15th,
convicted felon James W. Brode

526
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,695
<i>had taken his wife and children hostage.</i>

527
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:45,198
I remember that. You think that was Kira?

528
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,742
[L] <i>Initial speculation was that</i>
<i>his behavior was drug-related,</i>

529
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:50,370
<i>but lost in the ensuing crush</i>
<i>of Kira activities</i>

530
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,540
was the fact that Brode's toxicology
had come back clean.

531
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:55,500
The stand-off
had never made national news,

532
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,127
and it was only broadcast
on local Seattle stations.

533
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:01,130
-So that's how you knew he was here.
-I infiltrated your network

534
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:03,633
in order to ensure
that there hadn't been a data breach.

535
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,386
Prior to my access,
the network was intact.

536
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:09,347
Did you just hand me evidence
you hacked the Seattle P.D.?

537
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,766
I handed you evidence
that whoever Kira is,

538
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,143
they have access to the database
from the inside.

539
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:15,645
Kira's one of ours.

540
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,190
Here's a cross-reference list
of officers and their access

541
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:21,776
as well as the dates of Kira activities.

542
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,988
The Federal Administration has agreed
to make resources available to us.

543
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,240
We can begin seeing
who was where when.

544
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:30,368
-What are you gonna do?
-I'd like to start by speaking with Kira.

-Hey.
-Light, turn on the news.

551
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,109
<i>The individual known as Kira,</i>

552
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:06,446
<i>as I'm sure you're aware,</i>
<i>has taken credit for over 400 deaths.</i>

553
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:07,363
Oh, shit.

554
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,199
<i>While we don't know</i>
<i>how he kills his victims,</i>

555
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:11,993
<i>we do know how he chooses them.</i>

556
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,286
Prior to these deaths,

557
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,623
all of the victims have had
their identities released to the media.

558
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,293
This would suggest that Kira
is not some omnipotent force.

559
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:22,670
He's a person...

560
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:24,756
like you or me.

561
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,674
He is also a coward.

562
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,719
<i>A child wielding power</i>
<i>he does not understand,</i>

563
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:33,681
<i>mistakenly believing in doing so,</i>
<i>he's at no risk to himself.</i>

564
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:34,724
<i>He's wrong.</i>

565
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:39,604
Kira, if you're watching this,
know that I am coming for you.

566
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:44,525
Unless, of course,
you'd like to kill me right now.

Now I'm rooting for this guy.

00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,119
Would you shut the fuck up?

571
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:56,996
<i>No?</i>

572
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,292
<i>Well, in that case, Kira,</i>

573

<i>I shall be meeting you face-to-face</i>

What the fuck was that?

577
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:16,724
I have a theory.

578
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,560
Kira cannot kill by simply sight alone.

579
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,105
He needs a name and a face.

580
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:25,149
Every victim we've seen so far
fits this pattern.

581
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,068
So you antagonize him on purpose?

582
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,529
While withholding my identity
from the record.

583
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:33,491
Now, we know that he wants to kill me
but is unable.

584
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:34,909
And what if you're wrong?

585
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,329
Then, James, I'd be dead.

586
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,916
Either way, we'll have gained
valuable information.

587
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,752
He always pull this kind of stuff?

You guys getting close to catching Kira?

590
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:15,158
Oh, I'd say the haystack's down
to a hay pile. Still a lot of hay.

591
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,161
I saw the press conference today.

592
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,123
Who's that guy on TV with the turtleneck?

593
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:25,376
You like that look?
I'm thinking of taking it myself.

594
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,337
Hmm.

595
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:31,591
Goes by L.
He's an independent investigator.

596
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,801
Wow, so you don't even know
his real name.

597
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:37,346
About the only thing I know is
he's got some handler named Watari.

598
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,848
Really likes ice cream.

599
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,142
He's connected an awful lot of dots.

600
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,603
Do you think he's connected the dots
because he's Kira?

601
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,981
I don't think so.

602
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:49,192
He has a history of cracking big cases.

603
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:53,112
Besides, I think you can tell when you're
sitting across from a killer like Kira.

604
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:54,655
Right. Of course.

605
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,866
What happens when they catch Kira?

606
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,744
Well... he's murdered over 400 people,

607
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,163
so, my guess...

608
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,166
it's probably gonna be a fight
between those who want to hang him

609
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:08,711
and those who want to dissect him
and figure out how he did it.

610
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:12,840
-You okay?
-Yeah.

611
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:25,812
[Ryuk cackles]

You put someone on my kid?

613
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,655
We agreed that everyone with access
needed to be thoroughly vetted.

614
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,157
I did not see it prudent
to have you investigate yourself.

615
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:40,785
What? We're not talking
about investigating me.

616
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,620
We're talking about

769
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:45,371
I'll admit,
I always wondered if you had a line.

770
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:47,498
I guess it's fortunate for us,

771
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:51,752
the line you finally decided to draw
points so clearly in your direction.

772
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,754
-So you really think I'm Kira.
-No, I know it.

773
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:56,048
If you're so sure,
why haven't you just arrested me?

774
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:59,843
Because I don't do check, Light.
Only checkmate.

775
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:04,139
-But we'll be there soon enough.
-Great. Until then, enjoy the gelato.

776
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:07,434
Assuming you can eat through that thing.
And I'll just, uh...

777
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:14,525
Can I ask you something?

778
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,276
Yeah.

779
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:21,073
How do you think he does it? Kira.

780
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,909
I was hoping you could
shed some light on that for me.

781
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,035
I have a theory.

782
00:53:25,494 --> 00:53:28,163
I think that it's some form
of remote viewing

783
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:31,542
coupled with maybe some latent
psychic ability of some sort. Am I close?

784
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:34,128
So you really have no idea, do you?

785
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,088
Well, I have several ideas.

786
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:38,382
Eventually, you'll tell me
which is correct.

787
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:42,010
What if it turned out
that all arresting Kira did

788
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:45,973
was give that power to someone else,
someone potentially much worse.

789
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,809
You're suggesting the ability
is somehow transferable.

790
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,311
I'm suggesting maybe what you
and the person you're after want

791
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:52,229
isn't so different.

792
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,773
Maybe they're as ready
to see the killing end as you are.

793
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:57,192
And if that were true,
perhaps now would be a good time

794
00:53:57,276 --> 00:53:59,445
to start helping them
instead of hunting them.

795
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,365
Helping...

796
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:05,701
Hmm...

797
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:11,707
You know what I think, Light?
I think you want to make a deal.

798
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,917
Good deals are made by those
in a position of strength.

799
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,919
Criminals, such as yourself,
never make those deals.

800
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:18,839
What they do is wait until they're caught
and then they beg.

801
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:22,885
I'm not begging.
I'm telling you that you don't understand.

802
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:25,304
Let me put this in terms
you're more familiar with.

803
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,432
A man kills 400 people.

804
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,434
[loud clattering]

805
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,896
He tells us that it's complicated,
that he's misunderstood.

806
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:38,817
Do you think that Kira would hear
his excuses or walk him off a bridge?

807
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:41,153
Think you're better than me,
but you're trying to kill Kira!

808
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:43,822
-Kira, Kira, Kira!
-I do not kill, Light!

809
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:45,782
I don't even carry a gun,
it's distracting.

810
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:47,951
What I do is bring people to justice.

811
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:52,873
But the form it takes is their own making.
A consequence of their actions, not mine.

812
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,708
You're the one who flew into the sun.

813
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,127
I'm just here to make sure
you actually burn.

814
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:01,256
-Well, if that's how it has to be.
-It is, Light!

815
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:04,801
You know that as well as I do.
There are no draws in this game.

816
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,077
-Please, you have to forgive me.
-It was my dad, Mia.

817
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,788
If I could take it back, I would.
I promise. I was just scared.

818
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:35,082
Do you think I'm not scared?

819
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,460
I'm a fucking cheerleader, Light.

820
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:41,255
Nothing I do has ever mattered
until I met you.

821
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,841
I made a mistake. If I could take it back,
I would. I just...

822
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:48,011
I wasn't ready to lose you.

823
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,016
I love you.

824
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:02,651
I love you.

825
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,371
L showed me his face.

826
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:17,416
I'm gonna get his name,
and I'm gonna stop him.

827
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:25,507
That's Watari. He's L's right-hand man.

828
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:28,010
If anybody's gonna give us
L's real name, it's gonna be him.

829
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,014
All right.

830
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:34,892
[Light]<i> "Watari becomes obsessed</i>

00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:51,116
<i>At 7:00 p.m., on October 12th, he dies."</i>

835
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:53,285
[Ryuk] You didn't say how he dies.

836
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:55,203
-It doesn't matter, it's dealer's choice.
-What?

837
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:57,456
Huh? Oh, I was talking to Ryuk. Sorry.

838
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,917
-So kill his friend to get his name?
-No, I'm not gonna kill Watari.

839
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:02,044
That's the best part.

840
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,212
Rule 89 says:

841
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:06,381
"If the person who writes a name
destroys its page

842
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:09,760
prior to the death being carried out,
the target will be spared."

843
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:13,013
So if I burn Watari's page
before October 12th at 7:00 p.m...

844
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:15,641
then nothing bad happens, right, Ryuk?

845
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:18,894
Only one name can be removed
from the Death Note by burning it.

846
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:22,731
Get this one wrong,
you won't get another chance.

847
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,651
I only get one page to burn.

-This information is not known to me.
-I'm sorry. What do you mean?

852
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,750
I took responsibility for L

853
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:45,295
only after he left
the St. Martin's orphanage in Montauk

<i>where he was one of the Rochester wards.</i>

One of the...
Sorry, what is a Rochester ward?

856
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:52,094
They were orphans trained since childhood

857
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:55,639
to become the greatest detectives
the world had ever seen.

-You've gotta be kidding me.
<i>-I am not.</i>

859
00:57:57,808 --> 00:58:01,728
For their first test, the wards
were placed in a conditioning vault.

860
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:05,107
Those who retained their sanity
after seven months

861
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,317
were initiated into the program.

<i>L joined at six,</i>
<i>the youngest candidate ever.</i>

Okay, but what was his name
before the vault or whatever?

864
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:17,411
That name exists now
only in their records.

865
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,747
Okay. Okay. Watari,
you need to go there right now.

866
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,374
I should like to rest first.

867
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:26,128
Sleep is key to strong thought.

868
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:29,631
No. You don't have any time to sleep.
You have 48 hours to get a name.

Of course I do.

How?

889
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:35,507
Watari has disappeared.

890
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,509
I've known him my entire life.

891
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:41,555
He has not, would not, could not leave
without me being sure of his plans.

892
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,890
-Okay, let me make a call.
-What is it that you want?

-Sorry, I don't have any idea.
-I get that this has got you upset.

Your son is Kira, James!

01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:51,648
What?

896
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,775
Don't know why you haven't been able
to put one and one together,

01:00:53,859 --> 01:00:55,527
even despite him having spared your life,

898
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:58,613
but it does not speak well
to your deductive abilities at all.

899

It's time to leave.

-I'm not going anywhere.
-Wanna fucking bet?

I have a search warrant

So, as I said, I will be staying. You?
You have managed a strong move.

Now, provided that
you return Watari to me safely,

904

I'm willing to put
your position of strength into account.

905

I'm sorry about your friend.

01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:54,324
<i>As the Northwest Ferris Wheel</i>
<i>mysteriously collapses...</i>

1228
01:30:55,367 --> 01:30:58,411
<i>she pulls the page with my name on it</i>
<i>from the note.</i>

1229
01:30:59,496 --> 01:31:01,706
<i>And it is ultimately consumed by fire.</i>

1230
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:05,251
<i>Although her boyfriend</i>
<i>lands safely in the water...</i>

1231
01:31:05,794 --> 01:31:07,337
<i>Mia strikes the shoreline...</i>

1232
01:31:08,213 --> 01:31:09,214
<i>dying instantly.</i>

1233
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:13,051
<i>? Never wonder where I am ?</i>

1234
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:16,596
<i>? 'Cause I am always ?</i>

1235
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:21,267
<i>? By your side ?</i>

1236
01:31:22,435 --> 01:31:25,271
<i>? 'Cause you are my lady ?</i>

1237
01:31:25,355 --> 01:31:27,148
I made a lot of mistakes.

1238
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:30,276
And then I tried to fix them,
but it didn't work.

1239
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:33,863
I thought it was simple at first:
I was just gonna kill all the bad guys

1240
01:31:33,947 --> 01:31:36,408
and the good guys would win,
but it wasn't like that.

1241
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:39,828
<i>? Whenever you reach for me ?</i>

1242
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:47,752
<i>? I'll do all that I can ?</i>

1243
01:31:48,878 --> 01:31:53,133

<i>? Of the power of love ?</i>

1247
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:16,990
It's like you said...

1248
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:20,368
sometimes you gotta choose
the lesser of the two evils.

1249
01:32:21,911 --> 01:32:23,246
Which one are you, son?

What?

1255
01:32:38,428 --> 01:32:42,098
You humans are so interesting.
