1
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,931
MS-1, go ahead.

2
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,843
Activate the V-10 recorder.

3
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,322
Copy.

4
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,281
Quarter activation complete.

5
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,161
Copy. Thank you.

6
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,921
I know I'm not an ordinary
ten-year-old kid.

7
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,440
I mean, I do ordinary things.

8
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,687
Eat ice cream. Ride my bike.

9
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,289
I'm really good at playing sports.

10
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,721
Well... on my Xbox.

11
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,484
I love Minecraft, science
and dressing up for Halloween.

12
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,362
I love to lightsaber fight with my dad

13
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,728
and watch Star Wars movies with him.

14
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,805
And drive my big sister crazy.

15
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,405
And dream about being in outer space,
just like any ordinary kid.

16
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,164
I just don't look ordinary
when I'm doing these things.

17
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,288
Not even my birth was ordinary.

18
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,361
It was...

19
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,007
hilarious.

20
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,171
Now, how can a birth be hilarious,
you ask?

21
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,810
Ow! Ow!

22
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,484
A teenage doctor helps.

23
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,607
This is my first day.

24
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,207
Nate!

25
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,282
A massive video camera
also aids the situation.

26
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,606
But to really be funny,
you need what all the best jokes have:

27
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,241
a punch line.

28
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,765
He's coming!

29
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,168
With the baby. Go with the baby.

30
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,601
- Go, sir.
- Go with the baby.

31
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,925
I've had 27 surgeries since then.

32
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,405
They've helped me to breathe, to see,
to hear without a hearing aid,

33
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,121
and some even helped me look a bit better.

34
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,691
But none of them
have made me look ordinary.

35
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,201
He said he doesn't want to go.

36
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,447
But he's ready.

37
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,806
No, he's not ready.

38
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,962
I cannot home school him forever.

39
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,926
Every year that we wait,
it'll just be harder to start.

40
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,926
This is the first year of middle school
for everyone.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,002
He will not be the only new kid.

42
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,682
Okay, well, he's gonna be the only
new kid that looks like him.

43
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,850
Look, will you stop folding towels
for just one second and please listen?

44
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,161
It's like leading a lamb
to the slaughter...

45
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,441
and you know it.

46
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,808
I know I'll never
just be an ordinary kid.

47
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,443
Ordinary kids don't make other kids
run away from playgrounds.

48
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,847
Ordinary kids don't get stared
at wherever they go.

49
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,969
But it's okay if you wanna stare too.

50
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,686
My name is Auggie Pullman.

51
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,761
Next week, I start fifth grade.

52
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,166
And since I've never been
to real school before...

53
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,051
I'm pretty much totally
and completely petrified.

54
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,930
Mrs. Pullman, so good to see you again.

55
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,686
And you must be Auggie.
What a pleasure to meet you.

56
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,241
I'm Mr. Tushman.

57
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,848
You can laugh about that. Tushman.

58
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,401
I've heard them all.

59
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,161
- Tushy. Butt man. Butt face.
- Oh.

60
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,402
Mr. Tukus.

61
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,003
And then in the spring,
we have a science fair.

62
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,526
And from what your home school teacher
tells me, you'll get first prize.

63
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,041
You hear that, Auggie?

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,480
Then right before graduation,
whole class takes a trip

65
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,242
to a nature reserve in Pennsylvania.

66
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,164
It is the highlight of the year.

67
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,404
I promise you.

68
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,402
Oh good, they're here.

69
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,130
Um... who are they?

70
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,086
I thought it would be helpful for you
to meet some of our students

71
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,010
before you start school, Auggie.
What do you think?

72
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,245
Other kids now?

73
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,091
They were in the elementary
school so they know their way around...

74
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,486
and they'll give you a nice tour.

75
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,406
It will be fine.

76
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,130
Auggie, this is Jack Will,
Julian, and Charlotte.

77
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,210
Guys, this is Auggie Pullman.

78
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,088
- Hi.
- Hi.

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,922
Hey.

80
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,841
Meeting kids is harder
than meeting adults.

81
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,601
Everyone makes the same face at first...

82
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,526
but kids aren't as good at hiding it.

83
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,843
So I usually look down.

84
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,401
You can learn a lot
about people from their shoes.

85
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,211
I think these three are:

86
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,565
trust fund kid,

87
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,920
hand-me-down kid...

88
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,525
Uh-oh, crazy kid.

89
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,605
I act in TV commercials.

90
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,162
Really?

91
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,483
Yeah. Tide.

92
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,641
Why don't you guys
take Auggie around the school a bit, huh?

93
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,565
Just be back here in, um, a half hour?

94
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,331
I started when I was two.
Local spots mostly.

95
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,604
Then, when I was three, I booked
my first national. Nestlé Quik.

96
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,682
It was hard, because
I'm lactose intolerant.

97
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,402
Anyway, have you ever heard
of a spit bucket?

98
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,450
So this is our homeroom.
We have Mr. Browne.

99
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,804
My mom says he's a little weird.

100
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,170
Then I was in the chorus

101
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,689
of the Radio City Music Hall
Christmas Spectacular.

102
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,763
I auditioned for Annie on Broadway.

103
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,401
I got two callbacks for Molly, but I guess
they went in a different direction.

104
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,442
Hey, Charlotte?

105
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,045
Don't you ever stop talking?

106
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,488
So this is the cafeteria.

107
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,890
The food here is okay for school food.

108
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,330
Or do you eat special food?

109
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,881
Wow! This reminds me
of my guess spot on Law & Order.

110
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,250
So, the science elective
is supposably really hard.

111
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,169
So you probably won't be
spending much time here.

112
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,241
No offense, but if you've never
been in a real school before...

113
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,245
Dude, he's been home schooled.

114
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,841
Okay, I'm just saying.

115
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,123
Science is supposably really hard.

116
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,200
But you're taking it, too, right?

117
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,770
Hey, maybe you could
fail together.

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,446
Why don't you get out of the way,
so he can check it out?

119
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,162
Okay-

120
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,169
I mean, there's nothing much to see.
Desks. Chairs.

121
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,408
The incubator. Bunsen burners.

122
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,528
Those are some
really gross science posters.

123
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,047
Oh! And this is an eraser.

124
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,284
He knows what an eraser is.

125
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,324
How am I supposed to know what he knows?
He doesn't say anything.

126
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,129
You know what an eraser is, right?

127
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,611
Dude, you have to say something.

128
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,889
Yeah, I know what an eraser is.

129
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,002
Is-- is your name Jack or Jack Will?

130
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,602
Wait, you thought his name
was Jack Will?

131
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,202
Yeah, a lot of people call me
by my first and last name.

132
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,962
I don't know why.

133
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,766
Got any other questions?

134
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,888
Actually, I've got a question for Auggie.

135
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,362
- What's the deal with your face?
- Dude!

136
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,164
I mean, were you
in a car crash or something?

137
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,401
- Julian!
- What?

138
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,847
Tushman said we could
ask questions if we wanted to.

139
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,481
Not rude questions. Besides, he was born
like that, Mr. Tushman said.

140
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,007
Yeah, I know. I just thought maybe he was,
like, in a fire, too.

141
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,889
Hey, Julian, shut up.

142
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,089
- You shut up!
- Why don't we all shut up?

143
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,769
No, I wasn't in a fire.

144
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,364
And the word's "supposedly."

145
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,247
What?

146
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,321
You said that science
is "supposably really hard."

147
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,681
Twice.

148
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,530
The word's "supposedly." With a

149
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,601
Maybe my mom can home school you, too.

150
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,161
Do you wanna tell us yet
how you felt about the tour today?

151
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,562
Mr. Tushman went out of his way
to tell me how sweet those kids were

152
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,769
and that Julian
is apparently quite the dream.

153
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,085
No.

154
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,161
Not a dream?

155
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,330
Is he one of those kids that acts one way
in front of grownups

156
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,289
and then another way in front of kids?

157
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,211
Yeah, I guess.

158
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,171
Well, I know it's hard,
but you have to understand that

159
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,686
he probably feels badly about himself.

160
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,687
And when someone acts small, you just
have to be the bigger person, all right?

161
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,410
- Right.
- Right.

162
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,531
Via, I'll get the pizza.
Can you get the trivet?

163
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,761
Look at me, Auggie.

164
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,004
That kid sounds like a real jerk.

165
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,242
If somebody pushes you, you push back.

166
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,890
Don't be afraid of anyone.

167
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,086
Why are we whispering?

168
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,691
Because I'm afraid of Mom.

169
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,000
You just gotta be a bigger person
and rise above it. It's that easy.

170
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,090
Auggie, I do believe that this is the best
year for you to start school

171
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,487
because everybody is going to be new.

172
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,285
- But if you really don't wanna go--
- No. It's okay. I wanna go.

173
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,202
You do?

174
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,288
Mm-hmm.
- What changed your mind?

175
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,362
Well they have a really good
science elective.

176
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,244
And I need a better science teacher.

177
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,205
Oh!

178
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,601
- Oh, wow. There's that.
- Whoa! Whoa!

179
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,091
Are you gonna take that, Mom?

180
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,731
Can I get some backup here? You gonna
let him talk to your wife like this?

181
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,962
I'm not gonna let him
talk to my wife like that.

182
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,326
- Please!
- Get him. Come on, Via.

183
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,727
Get in there. Get in there. Get in there.

184
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,931
I'll meet you right here after school.

185
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,651
Okay? Right here.

186
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,284
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

187
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,841
I'll see you later.

188
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,721
Can you hear me?

189
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,009
We're gonna have a little man-to-man.

190
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,890
Now, I gotta stop here, because past this
point is a "No Dad Zone"

191
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,611
and you don't wanna walk up
with your parents because it's not cool.

192
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,522
But you're cool.

193
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,045
I know I am, but technically
most dads aren't, so...

194
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,565
And neither are these helmets.

195
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,327
Hey.

196
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,328
Two rules.
First, only raise your hand once a class,

197
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,811
no matter how many answers you know.

198
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,090
Except for science. Crush them all.

199
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,242
Check.

200
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,162
Second... you're gonna feel like
you're all alone, Auggie, but you're not.

201
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,521
Check.

202
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,961
Should we lose this? Come on,
costumes are for Halloween.

203
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,681
Prepare for blastoff.

204
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,961
I love you.

205
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,161
I love you, too.

206
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,964
- Have fun.
- Bye.

207
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,328
Have an excellent mission and Godspeed.

208
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,724
We are ready to proceed at this time.

209
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,202
10, 9, 8, 7...

210
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,203
Dear God, please,
make them be nice to him.

211
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,401
...4, 3, 2, 1.

212
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,566
My mom always said...

213
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,250
"If you don't like where you are...

214
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,484
just picture where you wanna be."

215
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,086
Auggie! Auggie!

216
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,045
Auggie! Auggie!

217
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,604
I can't wait till Halloween.

218
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,130
All right, let's settle down.

219
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,926
Everybody settle down.

220
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,889
Uh... Saved.

221
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,242
Sorry.

222
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,245
Everybody find your seats? Yes?

223
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,483
Finding our seats. Great.

224
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,080
All right, now some of us are lucky
enough to know each other. Yeah?

225
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,083
And-- and others are new. Hi there.

226
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,121
Okay-

227
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,967
My name is Mr. Browne.

228
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,401
And you're late.

229
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,647
Yeah. I'm so sorry.

230
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,730
I was just helping set up
chairs for the assembly.

231
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,724
Don't worry about it.
Can anybody tell me what this word means?

232
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,531
Anybody? No?

233
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,604
Precepts are rules
for really important things.

234
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,681
Like mottos.

235
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,366
Like mottos or like famous quotes.

236
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,286
Or like, um, lines
from a fortune cookie. Right?

237
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,966
Precepts can help motivate us.

238
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,963
They can guide us when
we have to make decisions

239
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,280
about really important things.

240
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,283
"Okay, so why are you talking to me
about precepts

241
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,646
this early in the morning, Mr. Browne?"

242
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,881
Well, let me tell you.

243
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,209
Because precepts also can
tell us a lot about ourselves.

244
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,768
"Who is it that I aspire to be?"

245
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,531
That is the question that we should
be asking ourselves all the time.

246
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,568
"What kind of person am I?"

247
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,331
So this is what we're gonna do.

248
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,926
Um, everyone's gonna come up
with two things...

249
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,607
that they think everybody else
should know about them.

250
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,841
All right? I'll go first.

251
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,641
Number one, I used to work on Wall Street.
For a long time.

252
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,567
And two, I left Wall Street
to pursue my dream and teach.

253
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,801
Boom! Who's next?

254
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,561
Yes.

255
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,806
Julian Albans.

256
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,451
And I think it's cool how
you're pursuing your dream.

257
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,486
Thank you very much, Julian.
Let's hear your two things.

258
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,961
Okay-

259
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,450
One, I just got Battleground Mystic
on my Wii and it's totally awesome.

260
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,242
And number two, we got
a ping pong table this summer.

261
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,088
Amazing. Any questions for Julian?

262
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,647
Yes?

263
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,883
Is Battleground Mystic
multiplayer or single player?

264
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,689
Let's-- Not those kinda questions.

265
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,286
Okay, uh...

266
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,485
Hi. My name's August Pullman.

267
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,561
"Auggie."

268
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,805
And, um...

269
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,203
I have a sister named Via
and a dog named Daisy.

270
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,566
I love Star Wars.

271
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,085
And I just said three things.

272
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,410
Yeah. Sorry.

273
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,562
Well, that sounds like a bonus
to me. Three things.

274
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,291
Thank you very much, Auggie,
that was perfect. Who's next?

275
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,125
Oh! I actually have a question for Auggie.

276
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,362
What's the deal with the braid
in the back of your hair?

277
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,245
Is it like a Padawan thing?

278
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,211
What's a Padawan thing?

279
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,247
Oh. It's from Star Wars.
Padawan is a Jedi apprentice.

280
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,720
Who's your favorite character, Auggie?

281
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,801
Boba Fett.

282
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,522
What about Darth Sidious? Do you like him?

283
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,521
Ouch.

284
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,448
Okay, can we talk about
Star Wars at recess? Yes?

285
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,610
All right. Who wants to read
this month's precept?

286
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,569
Me! Me! Me!

287
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,451
What about you? What's your name?

288
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,885
- Summer.
- Summer.

289
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,761
Wanna give it a shot?

290
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,766
"When given the choice between
being right or being kind...

291
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,241
choose kind."

292
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,121
Hey, can I sit there?

293
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,441
Sure.

294
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,446
You eat like the Sarlacc monster,
my young Padawan.

295
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,766
Newton's first law of motion.

296
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,648
An object in motion
will stay in motion unless...

297
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,162
It's okay, I didn't expect you
to know that on the first day.

298
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,645
Acted on by another force.

299
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,089
Acted on by another force.

300
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,841
Very good.

301
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,607
Here's how it works.

302
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,925
A moving object will only change
its speed or direction...

303
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,400
if something else causes it to do that.

304
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,524
Hey Darth Hideous, did you hear?

305
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,684
Padawan braids were lame 15 years ago.

306
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,885
Supposedly. With a

307
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,647
- Dude!
- More like they were always lame.

308
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,767
See you tomorrow.

309
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,646
Later, Barf Hideous.

310
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,685
- Hey.
- Hey, Mom.

311
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,401
Auggie, you're supposed to knock.

312
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm serious this time.

313
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,125
Wait, did someone make fun of it?

314
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,044
I, for one, had a great day.

315
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,891
Just trying to lighten the mood.

316
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,691
Right, Daisy? Right. Good girl.

317
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,810
Well I went to, um, Kinko's today

318
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,249
to see if they could get
my thesis off this.

319
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,730
You're gonna finish your dissertation?

320
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,687
- What is that?
- It's a floppy disk.

321
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,602
A What?

322
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,569
Come on! You-- It-- A floppy...

323
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,209
These kids today.
It's basically an iPhone.

324
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,131
You know, it doesn't play music
or, you can't call, but...

325
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,486
They couldn't get the file.

326
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,689
That's okay. You'll find a place.

327
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,441
Well, I think it's great, Mom.

328
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,881
Maybe. Thank you.

329
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,767
So Auggie...

330
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,801
Yeah?

331
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,602
Hi.

332
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,010
How was your first day of school?

333
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,610
Earth to Auggie. We asked you a question.

334
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,768
- Come on, how was your day?
- Good.

335
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,243
Good how? "Good," like it was good?

336
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,766
Or "good," like it was bad and
you just don't wanna tell us?

337
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,684
It was good, okay? I just don't know
what you want me to say! It was good!

338
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,845
Okay, hey! If you're mad at Mom about
going to school, it was my idea, too.

339
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,763
Why can't I just say "good"
like anybody else?

340
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,929
Batting a thousand today.

341
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,725
Are they gonna ask about my day?

342
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,842
That is not the way we leave the table.

343
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,887
Hey, come on. Talk to me.

344
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,401
Sit down.

345
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,007
Take that off, please.

346
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,724
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

347
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,691
It'll be okay.

348
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,289
Why do I have to be so ugly?

349
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,842
You are not ugly, Auggie.

350
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,086
You just have to say that
because you're my mom.

351
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,921
Oh, because I'm your mom,
it doesn't count?

352
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,482
Yeah.

353
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,610
Because I'm your mom, it counts the most
because I know you the most.

354
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,251
You are not ugly and anyone
who cares to know you will see that.

355
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,604
They won't even talk to me.

356
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,163
It matters that I look different.

357
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,690
I try to pretend that it doesn't,
but it does.

358
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,402
I know.

359
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,090
Is it always gonna matter?

360
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,847
I don't know.

361
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,081
Oh, honey.

362
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,601
Listen...

363
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,690
Look at me. We all...
have marks on our face.

364
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,486
I have this wrinkle here
from your first surgery...

365
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,049
and have these wrinkles here
from your last surgery.

366
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,362
This is the map...
that shows us where we're going.

367
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,602
And this is the map...
that shows us where we've been.

368
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,682
And it's never... ever ugly.

369
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,210
But what about your gray hair?

370
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,128
That's compliments of your dad, I think.

371
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,523
And as though we summoned him.

372
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,521
HOW Was your day?

373
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,048
My day is really good right now.

374
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:13,923
So they went to Florida,
where Gollum was living in Miami.

375
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,522
And...

376
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,331
Oh, you know what it is?
Daddy doesn't have his glasses on.

377
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,640
You're making this up.

378
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,285
August is the sun.

379
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,690
My mom and dad and me
are planets orbiting the sun.

380
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,562
But I love my brother and I'm used
to the way this universe works.

381
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,722
My mom says that on my fourth birthday...

382
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,886
I wished for a little brother.

383
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:00,288
And when he was born, it only took me
a few seconds and I was all over him.

384
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,841
Can you hear me?

385
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,526
If they stare, let them stare.

386
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,041
You can't blend in
when you were born to stand out.

387
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,160
I've never asked my mom
for help with my homework.

388
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,084
I never needed my dad to remind me
to study for a test.

389
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,844
I just did most of my studying
in waiting rooms and hospitals.

390
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,446
Mom and Dad would always say I was
the most understanding girl in the world.

391
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,281
I don't know about that.

392
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,086
I just knew my family
couldn't take one more thing.

393
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,087
I know my family loves me,
but ever since my grandma died,

394
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,370
my best friend Miranda is the only person
who knows me.

395
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,401
Miranda!

396
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,288
Wow. Look at you.

397
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,287
Hey, Via.

398
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,442
I've texted you, like, 1000 times.

399
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,806
When'd you get back from camp?

400
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,007
Two weeks ago.

401
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,967
Two weeks?

402
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,646
Sorry, it's been crazy. You know?

403
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,971
Yeah, no, that's okay.

404
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,681
What'd you do to your hair?

405
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,322
Do you like it?

406
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,886
Yeah. Yeah.

407
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,450
It looks wild.

408
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,201
Just trying something different, you know?

409
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,641
I'll catch you later.

410
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,923
- Hey, Ella.
- Hey.

411
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,881
Thinking about signing up?

412
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,366
- For what?
- The Drama Club.

413
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,728
They study theater in the fall
and do a play in the spring.

414
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,091
Um... No, not really.
I'm-- I'm not a theater nerd.

415
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,880
Well, that's too bad. I am.

416
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,360
I'm Justin, by the way.

417
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,282
Sorry, that was... That was rude. Um...

418
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,849
I'm Via. Olivia.

419
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,610
First days suck, don't they?

420
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,808
Yeah. Yeah, they do.

421
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,447
My mom tried to walk me here
from the subway.

422
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,049
I literally had to ditch her
at the traffic light.

423
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,566
My mom still doesn't think
I can use a MetroCard.

424
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,646
Are you an only child too?

425
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,210
Yeah. Yeah.

426
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,281
They never listen.

427
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,971
This one time I told my mom

428
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,646
I wanted to take guitar lessons
and play like Jimi Hendrix.

429
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,002
What happened?

430
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,202
Well it was nice to meet you, Via. Olivia.

431
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,604
Yeah. It was nice to meet you too, Justin.

432
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,841
Maybe, I'll see you around.

433
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,445
Though not onstage, clearly.

434
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,322
Come in.

435
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,641
Good night, honey.

436
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,961
Wh-- Where's Mom?

437
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,685
She fell asleep.

438
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,291
Oh. Okay.

439
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,326
How's Auggie?

440
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,243
There's some bully, you know, that...

441
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,771
How was your first day?

442
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,645
It was-- It was really good.

443
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,842
It was good?

444
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,162
Yeah.

445
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,170
Say hi to Miranda for us.

446
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,562
I Will.

447
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,001
Sweet dreams.

448
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,002
Good night.

449
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,526
My mom put her life
on hold for my brother.

450
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,603
She always wanted to be a children's book
illustrator and teach art.

451
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,491
She was one thesis shy of getting
her master's when Auggie was born.

452
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,131
Then... she stopped writing it.

453
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,966
She stopped a lot of things
when Auggie was born.

454
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,850
But she is still great at drawing.

455
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,522
I don't know if she even realizes that

456
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,042
she makes Auggie the center
of every universe she draws.

457
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,607
Miranda used to joke that
my house was like the Earth.

458
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,362
It revolved around the son...
not the daughter.

459
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,604
That doesn't change the fact
that my mother has a great eye.

460
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,090
I just wish that one time...

461
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,891
she would use it to look at me.

462
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,371
Yeah, good job, good job.

463
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,802
Miranda?

464
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,888
Via? What are you doing here?

465
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,164
Just trying something new. You?

466
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,081
Uh, same.

467
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,451
All right, everybody,
let's go. Time for vocal warm up.

468
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,488
Bring it in!
Bring it in, people, let's go!

469
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,245
Everybody, hands up! Reach high! And...

470
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,161
Guys, can you please...

471
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,130
Okay. You, you... You guys, scooch.

472
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,248
Sit. Just be closer.

473
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,321
Ladies and gentlemen.

474
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,809
Stay. Stay, good.

475
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,851
Hey, hey. What's your name?

476
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,401
Auggie.

477
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,121
Nice boots.

478
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,844
Great. Thanks.

479
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,123
Okay, everybody, here we go.
We're scooching and say "Cheese."

480
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,767
Cheese!

481
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,649
School became...
Well, I got used to it.

482
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,405
Except for dodgeball.

483
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,320
What evil man invented dodgeball?

484
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,164
But my least favorite zone
at school is courtyard.

485
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,443
Because the whole school's there.

486
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,441
No one does anything mean.
Or says anything. Or laughs.

487
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,168
They all just look, then look away,
then look back.

488
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,371
They're just being normal kids.

489
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,606
I kinda wanna tell them,
"Hey, I know I look weird, but it's okay."

490
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,689
I mean, if Chewbacca started
going to school here one day,

491
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,923
I'd probably stare at him a bit, too.

492
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,528
I'm sorry if my staring
made you feel weird.

493
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,082
In order for any of us to see,
we need light.

494
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:48,003
So right now light is bouncing off
this card traveling through the air,

495
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,889
through the glass, to your eye.

496
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,368
But what if we added water?

497
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,249
Whoa!

498
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,800
Whoa, indeed.

499
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:08,804
Any time light passes from one material
or medium to another, it bends.

500
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,603
This bending of light is also known as...

501
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,481
Refraction.

502
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,841
Very good, Auggie.

503
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,601
Jack, you okay?

504
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,086
Yeah, yeah, refraction.

505
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,604
Good. Clear your desks. Pop quiz.

506
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,001
Hurry.

507
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,050
Hey, Jack, come sit here.

508
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,001
In a sec.

509
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,802
Where's he going?

510
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,161
Hey. Thanks for your help today.

511
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,561
No problem.

512
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,041
And don't worry, I got a couple wrong
so Ms. Petosa wouldn't know.

513
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,285
I'm not worried.
The worst they can do is kick me out.

514
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,805
Not loving school either, huh?

515
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,201
Oh, it's great.

516
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,371
I wanted to go to Wayne Middle.

517
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,324
The one with the great sports teams.

518
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,561
Then Why'd you come here?

519
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,331
They gave me the scholarship.

520
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,006
Well, if you need help in science,

521
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,162
you can come to my house after school.

522
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,167
You know, if you want.

523
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,851
Great. Thanks!

524
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,281
What's wrong?

525
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,088
I just don't like eating
in front of people.

526
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,521
What do you mean?

527
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,166
It's a long story,

528
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,006
but when I eat, I think I chew like
some prehistoric swamp turtle.

529
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,169
No joke? Me too!

530
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,090
Now there's tuna on your face.

531
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,169
Yeah! Tuna-Man!

532
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,447
No, no, no, let me show you how it's done.

533
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,490
Dude, that's even more gross.

534
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,484
I'm going as Boba Fett this year.

535
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,007
I like Halloween,
but Christmas is still the best holiday.

536
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,128
No way. Halloween is the best.

537
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,011
A pillowcase of candy versus
two weeks off school?

538
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,362
You're nuts.

539
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,487
You see? Even your dog agrees.

540
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,648
Hey, Mom, is it okay if Jack comes over?

541
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,364
- Yes!
- Thanks, Mrs. P.

542
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,289
I mean, you get snow on Christmas.

543
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,410
But you can get snow on Halloween.

544
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,922
- How?
- If you live in Alaska

545
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,001
or there's a blizzard.

546
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,084

No, I've never thought about it. Why?

What?

576
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,366
Um, I can't figure you out.

577
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,601
Oh?

578
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,729
Well, most theater people won't
stop talking about themselves,

579
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,411
but you don't talk.

580
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,841
I-- I listen.

581
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,482
- Me too.
- I know.

582
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,571
Oh. So you do pay attention.

583
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,531
Okay, that's a start. Uh...

584
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,162
I'm a good listener so tell me something.

585
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,161
Who are you gonna audition for?

586
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,082
Um, I'm not really the Our Town-type.

587
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,284
Oh come on.
Don't be the "run lights girl."

588
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,802
Should be Emily.

589
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,882
The lead?

590
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,242
Look, your family can't cheer
for you in a booth.

591
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,690
Oh, they're-- they're pretty busy.

592
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,569
I don't think they would
cheer for me anyway.

593
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,367
Come on, there-- there's not one person
in your family who would applaud you?

594
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,361
My grandmother.

595
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,886
There you go. Bring her.

596
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,447
I can't.

597
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,608
Well, uh, then I'll applaud you.

598
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,285
Why are you being so nice to me?

599
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,971
Because you're an only child.

600
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,046
We have to stick together.

601
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,120
Think about it. Okay?

602
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,361
And, uh, your grandmother's
still cheering you on.

603
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,251
I know you.

604
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,124
And I love you more than
anything in the world.

605
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,242
Well... what about Auggie?

606
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,286
I love your brother.

607
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,606
But he has a lot of angels
looking out for him.

608
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,806
And you have me.

609
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,122
Yeah.

610
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,644
You are everywhere.

611
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,041
And...

612
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,641
you are my favorite.

613
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,848
You're my favorite too, Grams.

614
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,568
Mom, Daisy ruined my Boba Fett costume!

615
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,962
What? Where have you been? It's very late.

616
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,530
- She threw up all over it.
- Sorry.

617
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,882
Okay, well, you'll just have to wear
your costume from last year.

618
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,203
But I told Jack I was going as Boba Fett,
not Ghostface.

619
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,642
Well, tomorrow is Halloween.
And all the shops are closed.

620
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,802
And my artistic hands are busy
making meatloaf.

621
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,927
So you do the math.

622
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,247
Fine!

623
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,965
- Do you need some help, Mom?
- What?

624
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,807
Some help.

625
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,207
Oh, um, yes, thank you.

626
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,724
Uh, mince that rosemary, please.

627
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,806
Where did you say you were?

628
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,561
I, uh... I went to Coney Island.

629
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,609
How about you stay home
from school tomorrow? Hmm?

630
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,160
It's Halloween. We can
make it a three-day weekend.

631
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,851
Spend some time together.

632
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,968
Yeah. Yeah, that would be really nice.

633
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,011
Yeah? Okay, good.

634
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,411
Peppers? I don't want peppers.
Peppers give Daddy gas.

635
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,530
I don't care what Jack Will says
about Christmas.

Hey, Auggie!

638
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,050
For me, Halloween
is the best holiday in the world.

639
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,571
It's so awesome,
when I'm wearing the costume.

640
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,450
I usually walk with my head down
to avoid being seen.

641
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,562
But on Halloween,
I walk with my head up high.

642
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,122
♪ He did the mash
It caught on in a flash ♪

643
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,602
♪ He did the mash
He did the monster mash... ♪

644
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,444
I don't even know who that was.

645
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,171
He didn't even know who I was.
It's so cool.

646
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,527
Especially because people
don't like to touch me

647
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,409
because they think I'm contagious.

648
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,041
Oh, yeah, Chewie! Up high!
Boom goes the dynamite!

649
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,408
♪ They did the mash
They did the monster mash... ♪

650
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,369
It really does look like him.

651
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,570
- This part right?
- Yeah.

652
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,969
I mean, he's always reminded
me of, like, the shrunken head, you know?

653
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,326
- Or an orc.
- Yeah.

654
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,411
If I looked like him I swear,
I'd put a hood over my face every day.

655
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,529
Yeah, if I looked like him,
I think I'd kill myself.

656
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,250
Why do you hang out with him
so much, Jack?

657
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,129
- Yeah.
- Uh... I dunno.

658
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,003
Tushman asked me to be his welcome buddy

659
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,811
and now he just
follows me around everywhere.

660
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,241
Well, that must stink!
That must stink.

661
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,245
Oh, yeah. Just like him.

662
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,405
Nobody puts Baby in the corner.

663
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,322
Come on.

664
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,607
Always blows my mind how much Daddy
looks like Patrick Swayze in this movie.

665
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,521
Ew!

666
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,931
Ew, no!

667
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,850
Honey, tell me what's going on
with Miranda?

668
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,680
It's not-- It's not just the pink hair.

669
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,681
She's just...

670
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,205
She won't even talk to me.

671
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,565
I had a friend in high school.

672
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,569
We went through this exact same thing.

673
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,764
And what I did, which fixed it
almost immediately...

674
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,762
Yeah?

675
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:40,809
Was, um, to eat an entire jack-0'-lantern
bucket of candy.

676
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,925
Mm. Hello?

677
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,401
Yes, Mr. Tushman.

678
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,321
He's nauseous?

679
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,200
Does he have a fever?

680
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,401
What did the nurse say?

681
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,727
I'm so sorry, honey.

682
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,485
All right. Okay. Thank you.
I will be right there.

683
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,167
Honey, I have to go, your brother
just threw up at school.

684
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,442
Nate, do you know
where his helmet is?

685
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,249
He's asking for it
and I've looked everywhere.

686
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,686
I don't know. Something at school.

687
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,489
He won't say.
He won't come out of his room.

688
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,767
And now he says he doesn't even
wanna go trick-or-treating.

689
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,646
I know. Okay. Thank you. Just get here.

690
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,761
Come on, get ready.

691
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,044
It's almost time for the Halloween parade.

692
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,605
You're supposed to knock!

693
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,527
Go away!

694
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,402
Mom says you won't say what happened.

695
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,481
Did someone say something?

696
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,802
Someone always says something!

697
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:16,927
Well tell me what happened.

698
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,690
It's none of your business!

699
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,003
You took my day with Mom,
so it is my business.

700
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,725
I heard Jack Will talking
about me behind my back.

701
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,641
He said he'd kill himself
if he looked like me.

702
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:30,961
Jack Will?

703
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,800
Isn't he the nice one?

704
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,769
There are no nice ones!

705
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,401
I wish I'd never gone
to school in the first place!

706
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,001
But you were liking school.
I know you were.

707
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,923
I hate it, okay? I hate it.

708
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,966
Auggie, I'm sorry, but you're not
the only one who has bad days.

709
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,206
Bad days? Do people avoid touching you?

710
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,843
When a person accidentally touches you,
do they call it "the plague"?

711
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,601
- No.
- Jack Will was all I had.

712
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,162
So just don't compare your bad days
at school to mine, okay?

713
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,162
Okay-

714
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,282
Hey.

715
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,242
Did you notice that Miranda
doesn't come around anymore?

716
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,487
What?

717
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,122
You didn't. Shocker.

718
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,725
Yeah. She went away to camp this summer
and now she doesn't like me anymore.

719
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,287
Why?

720
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,161
Because“.

721
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,766
School sucks.

722
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,840
And people change.

723
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,407
So if you wanna be a normal kid, Auggie,
then those are the rules.

724
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,803
So let's go trick-or-treating.

725
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,681
Okay?

726
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,486
Because right now...
we're each other's best friends.

727
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,042
Really?

728
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:55,647
Yes.

729
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,721
So... come on.

730
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,249
I'll let you have all my Halloween candy.

731
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,721
I'll trade you my apples.

732
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,122
Okay, no. I-- I know that I said
that you could have all my candy,

733
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,601
but I was really just saying that
to get you out of the house.

734
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,647
What about the chocolate?

735
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,085
- No.
- And the Smarties?

736
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,567
Gummies, the licorice,
the Reese's, the Hersheys...

737
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,165
- No!
- And everything else.

738
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,368
All right, I'll let you have all my candy.

739
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:33,523
Okay, Via. You are next please.
Let's hear it for Via.

740
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,322
Daisy...

741
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,761
do you wanna help me
take back my corner office?

742
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,322
Hey, Auggie! You feeling better?

743
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,162
Are you okay, Auggie?

744
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,602
Yeah.

745
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,766
You sure?
'Cause you're acting really weird.

746
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:29,921
I'm okay, Jack, okay?

747
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,522
Okay-

748
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,085
They want me to do what?

749
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,844
Give a tour through the school.

750
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,926
But Mom, it's summer vacation.

751
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,001
I know.

752
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,120
But your teachers told Mr. Tushman
you're known as a good egg.

753
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,282
- No, I'm a bad egg.
- You're a good egg.

754
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,891
And I'm actually really proud
they thought of you for this.

755
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,365
Mom, enough with the guilt.

756
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,364
And you know they gave you
a scholarship, right?

757
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,967
Mom...

758
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,160
Who else is doing it?

759
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,482
Uh, Charlotte and Julian.

760
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,445
- No.
- Why, what's wrong?

761
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,923
Charlotte will just talk about
Broadway the whole time.

762
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,685
And Julian is the biggest
phony on the planet.

763
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,842
So I'm sorry, but no.

764
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,321
Jack, it's for that boy.

765
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:35,767
Who?

766
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,970
The one from the ice cream shop.

767
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,442
Oh.

768
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:42,962
Yeah.

769
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,690
So if a nice kid like your little brother
cries when he sees him,

770
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,761
what kind of a chance do you
think he has in middle school?

771
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,765
Okay-

772
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,247
Thank you, kiddo.

773
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,121
Four things I've learned
about Auggie Pullman:

774
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,610
First of all, you do get used to his face.

775
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,608
Now, this is not like regular ice.

776
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,569
You can't touch it with your hands, okay?

777
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,611
Second, he's really smart.

778
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,921
He's ahead of me in everything.

779
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,601
In science, he's ahead
of the whole school.

780
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,241
Is everybody watching?

781
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,840
Whoo!

782
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,722
Third of all,
he's actually pretty funny.

783
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,681
But fourthly, now that I know him,

784
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,650
I would say I actually do
wanna be friends with Auggie.

785
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,248
At first, I admit it,

786
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,324
I was only friendly to him
because my mom asked me to be nice.

787
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,649
But now I would choose
to hang out with him.

788
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,771
Like, he's a good friend.

789
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,525
Like if all the guys in fifth grade
were lined up against a wall

790
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,921
and I could choose anyone
I wanted to hang out with...

791
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,120
I would choose Auggie.

792
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,561
Hey, what's wrong?

793
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,001
Go away.

794
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,041
Oh, hey, Jack, come sit with us.

795
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,087
Yeah, come on, man.

796
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,126
I wonder what happened.

797
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,885
Maybe Jack touched Auggie

798
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,327
and couldn't wash his hands in time.
Jack finally got "the plague."

799
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,285
That's not very nice.

800
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,571
What? We didn't start it.

801
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,961
Where you going?

802
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,965
Hi. I'm Summer.

803
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,248
I know. We're in the same homeroom.

804
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,445
You don't have to do this.

805
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,041
Do what?

806
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,405
You don't have to be my friend.

807
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,171
I know Tushman talked to you.

808
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,245
I don't know what you're
talking about, Auggie.

809
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,365
I know Tushman talked to some kids
before school started

810
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,324
and told them they had to be
friends with me.

811
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,961
He didn't talk to me.

812
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,641
Yeah, he did.

813
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,082
- No, he did not.
- Yeah, he did.

814
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,049
No, he didn't, I swear on my life!

815
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:06,090
Okay, okay.
You don't have to get mad.

816
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,722
I don't like being accused
of things, okay?

817
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,485
Okay. I'm sorry.

818
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,561
You should be.

819
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,288
- He really didn't talk to you?
- Auggie!

820
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,840
Okay, I just--
Why are you sitting here then?

821
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,322
Because I want some
nice friends for a change.

822
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,122
Me, too.

823
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:26,801
Cool beans.

824
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,526
But you'll get "the plague."

825
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:31,642
Good.

826
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,286
Summer has "the plague."

827
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,961
Shut up!

828
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,129
So what happened with Jack Will?

829
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,401
Promise you won't tell?

830
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,485
I got it! I got the part!

831
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,449
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

832
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,647
She got it! She got the part! Oh, my God!

833
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,766
- Bet she got Emily.
- Yep.

834
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,002
What'd you get?

835
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,446
Emily's understudy.

836
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,485
I'm not saying poison or anything,

837
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,244
but just a little Benadryl

838
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,845
to knock Miranda out before the show.

839
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,048
Okay, enough.

840
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,806
Look, just learn her lines and it'll give
us an excuse to hang out more.

841
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,763
We can start rehearsing
the kissing scene on page 110.

842
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,447
Wait. George and Emily?

843
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,810
There is no page 110.

844
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:39,086
So I'm thinking...
I really wanna kiss you right now.

845
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,889
But I don't know how you'll respond.

846
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:00,921
What's wrong?

847
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,770
I'm not an only child.

848
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:12,482
Mom?

849
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,881
One sec, Via. Auggie, let's go!

850
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,844
I thought you were at the library.

851
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,531
Er, um... Yeah, change of plans.

852
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,722
Mm-hmm.

853
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,926
Hi, I'm Justin.

854
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,406
I'm Isabel.

855
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,050
Daisy threw up again. Bucket loads.

856
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:36,801
Bucket loads.

857
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,046
Um, Justin, this is
my little brother Auggie.

858
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,524
- Hey. Dude!
- Hey.

859
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,051
What's that in your case? A machine gun?

860
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,682
Uh, no. It's a fiddle.

861
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,410
You should tell people it's a machine gun.

862
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,925
That's way cooler.

863
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,322
You know what?

864
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,931
That's a great idea, you're right.

865
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,080
We're on our way to the grocery.

866
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,566
Mom's making... What's it called?

867
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,768
- Feijoada.
- Feij... Mom's making feijoada.

868
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,762
It's Dad's favorite.

869
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,525
You're welcome to stay
if you want, Justin.

870
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,207
Oh, thank you very much.
It was nice meeting you.

871
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,441
Nice to meet you too.

872
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,450
Psst. Oy!

873
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,806
Bye, Auggie.

874
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,246
Nothing to see here.

875
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:34,165
It's a gene. Well, it's sort of two genes,
but two genes that are identical.

876
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:36,328
And the trouble is that both of my parents

877
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,687
carry the gene at the same time,
which is...

878
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,766
Well essentially... he won the lottery.

879
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,361
Backwards or something.

880
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:48,960
And... in another world,
I'd look like him.

881
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,611
I'm sorry for telling you
that I was an only child.

882
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,807
Sometimes it's nice to hide a little.

883
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,289
I get it. It's okay.

884
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,726
- Hello?
- Major Tom, is that you?

885
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:42,722
Miranda!

886
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,122
It's so great to hear your voice again.

887
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,644
Sorry, Via's not here.

888
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,362
I was actually calling
to say hello to you.

889
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,001
How have you been?

890
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,721
Good. Did you know I'm going
to a regular school now?

891
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:55,967
No way.

892
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,561
Do you like it?

893
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,530
Yeah, I guess.

894
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,489
It's not as hard as Mom's home school.

895
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,330
Yeah, I'll bet.

896
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,445
How are the kids? Are they nice?

897
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,281
No. But I made one friend.

898
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,321
Her name's Summer.
We started a summer names club.

899
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,202
Summer, August. Get it?

900
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,408
Good for you, Auggie.

901
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,688
Um, where's Via, anyway?

902
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,000
She's out with her boyfriend.

903
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:26,402
Really?

904
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,931
Yeah. We met him last week.
He's super nice.

905
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,885
I've missed you, Major Tom.

906
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,086
I miss you too, Miranda.

907
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,568
And can you tell Via
that I've missed her too?

908
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,406
Well, but why don't you just
tell her yourself?

909
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,250
Listen, I gotta go,
my mom's calling me, but, um...

910
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,128
you know that you can call me
anytime, right?

911
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:57,481
Yeah.

912
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,968
Okay, so call me anytime.

913
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:02,962
I Will.

914
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,726
Merry Christmas, Auggie.

915
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,091
Merry Christmas, Miranda.

916
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,928
- Get after it.
- Just open it. Rip it apart.

917
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,966
Via and I have been best friends
since kindergarten.

918
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,521
Oh, my God!

919
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,126
Her family's always
been like my second family.

920
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,883
Auggie's always felt
like my little brother.

921
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,405
How does it feel?

922
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:46,651
- Awesome.
- Good.

923
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,849
And for a few years even,
our family's spent Christmas together.

924
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,604
Everybody say "Merry Christmas!"

925
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,047
Merry Christmas!

926
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,446
But now my dad's busy
with his new wife...

927
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:01,885
who was his old boss.

928
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:07,521
And my mom, well,
she's busy not getting over that.

929
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,404
I got a job at a summer camp...

930
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,162
just so I 'd have somewhere
to go that wasn't home.

931
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:22,287
One day, and I swear
I didn't plan this but...

932
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,601
I started playing this little
make believe game...

933
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,890
with the girls in the camp.

934
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,961
I said I lived in a huge brownstone.

935
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,091
On a nice street...

936
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,047
with my two awesome parents

937
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,968
and my awesome dog, named Daisy.

938
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,003
And my awesome little brother...

939
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,405
with a facial deformity.

940
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,767
And, oh, my God, everyone went crazy.

941
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,691
"What do you mean, 'deformity'?

942
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,046
What does he look like?"

943
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:57,289
Suddenly, everyone wanted to talk to me.

944
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,166
And by the end of summer...
I was the most popular girl in camp.

945
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,601
When I got home, I wanted to call Via.

946
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:11,166
But she would've asked me
about my parents and about camp.

947
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,691
And then I saw Via audition for the play

948
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,201
and I remembered how cool she is.

949
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:21,925
And how I understood why everyone in camp

950
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,367
loved me more when I pretended to be her.

951
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,806
She used to let Auggie
hang out with us all the time.

952
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:33,001
I was the one who bought him
his astronaut helmet.

953
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,769
He was so into outer space.

954
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,164
And I wanted him to know that the world
was bigger than his room.

955
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:47,405
And now he's out there...
and I didn't even know.

956
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:50,845
I could've helped him.

957
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,242
Maybe he could've helped me.

958
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:56,881
I don't know.

959
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,689
But I could sure use some help right now.

960
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:14,250
♪ Yeah, you better watch out
You better not cry ♪

Thanks for the help, Daisy.
Way to put your back into it.

981
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,121
What about you?

982
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:09,730
Christmas was awesome.

983
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,883
We drove up into the mountains where they
had the most amazing snow I've ever seen.

984
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,004
- It was like powder.
- Nice.

985
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,081
What about you, Jack?

986
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:19,369
I went up Skeleton Hill. It was the best.

987
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,488
- Skeleton Hill?
- I hate that place.

988
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:22,686
It should be called Garbage Hill.

989
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:23,761
I know, right?

990
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:26,446
I left my old lightning sled
there last time I was up.

991
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,049
It was the crappiest piece of junk.

992
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,528
Went back the next day
and someone had taken it.

993
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,523
Hey, maybe a homeless
guy wanted to go sledding.

994
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:34,761
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

995
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:36,646
New precept.

996
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:39,161
Your deeds are your monuments.

997
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,368
Archaeologists found these words inscribed

998
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,408
on the walls of an ancient Egyptian tomb.

999
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,005
Can anybody tell me what they mean?

1000
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,441
Summer?

1001
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,485
Oh, uh...

1002
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:56,081
I think it means that the things we do
are the things that matter most.

1003
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,206
Excellent. Anybody else?

1004
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:03,720
Hey, Summer.

1005
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,645
Hey. You okay?

1006
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,046
Yeah. Fine. Just...

1007
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:13,248
This is gonna sound stupid, but...

1008
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:17,001
do you know why Auggie stopped liking me?

1009
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,761
You should ask him.

1010
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:23,724
I have, but ever since Halloween,
he just won't talk to me.

1011
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:28,121
I mean, you know what?
I don't care. Sorry.

1012
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,526
Ghostface.

1013
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:32,607
Wait, wait, what?

1014
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,765
That's all I can tell you.

1015
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:42,450
Okay... Now that we've finished our tests,

1016
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:46,844
I want you all to start thinking about
our fifth grade science fair project.

1017
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:50,367
Which you will need to work on
to have ready after spring break.

1018
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:54,287
Okay? Now it could be about anything.

1019
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:55,486
Just make sure...

1020
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,206
The point is...

1021
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,011
to create something you're excited about.

1022
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:13,650
Something you're proud to show.

1023
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:15,327
Mr. Will?

1024
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:17,881
Mr. Will?

1025
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,565
Something more important to think about?

1026
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,162
No.

1027
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,164
So, it'll be teams of two.

1028
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,528
Your partner will be your tablemate.

1029
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:28,807
Uh, Ms. Petosa?

1030
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,762
I know we're supposed to be in pairs,
but...

1031
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,922
Jack, Amos, and I had
this science fair project idea

1032
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,331
that we wanted to work on together.

1033
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,164
- Okay, maybe we can switch--
- Uh, no.

1034
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,043
- Sorry?
- What?

1035
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:44,250
No, um, it's-- it's okay.
I'll stay with who I've got.

1036
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,445
I'll stick with Auggie.

1037
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:54,082
Hey! What did you do that for?

1038
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:55,730
Dude, I don't want to switch.

1039
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,849
Why not? Do you really wanna
be partners with that freak?

1040
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:11,921
Dear Mr. Tushman,
I am very sorry for punching Julian.

1041
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,130
It was wrong of me to do that.

1042
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,529
I know you may need to expel me,

1043
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:19,410
but I'd still rather not say...

1044
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:22,044
Why I did What I did.

1045
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,802
It might get Julian in trouble too

1046
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,684
- and that's not fair.
- Stop!

1047
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,721
Sincerely, Jack Will.

1048
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,646
Dear Mr. Will...

1049
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:36,610
one thing I've learned in 20 years
in education

1050
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,331
is that there are two sides
to every story.

1051
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:44,762
So I think I can imagine
what started the fight.

1052
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:49,170
While nothing justifies
striking another student...

1053
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:53,001
I know good friends are worth defending.

1054
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:57,251
So, after your two-day suspension...

1055
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,203
your scholarship will be waiting for you.

1056
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,086
I thought we were friends.

1057
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,571
Just keep up the good work.

1058
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,400
And keep being the fine boy
we all know you to be.

1059
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:10,404
Sincerely, Mr. Tushman.

1060
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,806
What's so wrong with me
not telling you about a stupid play?

1061
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,042
I'm not even in it,
I'm just doing the lights.

1062
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:23,124
Well, your boyfriend is and don't
you think we would like to see him?

1063
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,885
- No, I don't.
- Look, let's all calm down for a second.

1064
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,405
You know, you've been really good

1065
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:28,891
at leaving me alone my whole life.

1066
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,323
So why are you suddenly
so interested, huh?

1067
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,926
Are you-- Are you bored
now that Auggie's in school?

1068
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:35,810
Your thesis not going well?

1069
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,725
Nate, could you please excuse us?

1070
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,131
- Izzy, she doesn't mean--
- Nate!

1071
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:47,891
What are they saying down there?

1072
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:51,129
They, my friend,
are saying a lotta things.

1073
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:53,049
None of which concern us.

1074
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,330
Let's see your new Minecraft world,

1075
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,649
'cause we might be moving to it.

1076
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:12,249
So, are we going to see the play?

1077
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:17,365
Um... I hadn't realized what the play was

1078
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,762
and I don't think it will be of any
interest to a kid your age.

1079
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,726
Yeah, uh, you'd-- you'd get totally bored.

1080
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,886
Are you and Dad going?

1081
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,566
Daddy will go
and I'm gonna stay here with you.

1082
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,162
What?

1083
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,007
So now you're gonna punish me
by not going?

1084
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:37,001
Well, you didn't want me to go
in the first place, remember?

1085
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,886
Well, now that you know about it,
of course I want you to come.

1086
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:42,366
What are you talking about?

1087
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:43,407
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

1088
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,081
You're lying.

1089
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,807
It's just something to do
with Via's school, honey.

1090
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:54,281
You just don't want your
fancy high school friends

1091
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:55,691
to know your brother's a freak, huh?

1092
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,489
- Auggie!
- Auggie, that's not true.

1093
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:00,484
Stop lying to me. I'm not an idiot,
I know what's going on!

1094
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:11,841
Daisy girl?

1095
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:14,762
Auggie. Come on.

1096
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,687
It's okay, I don't wanna go
to your stupid high school anyway.

1097
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:18,602
I don't care.

1098
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:21,001
Auggie, not everything
in the world is about you.

1099
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,041
What's wrong?

1100
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:40,171
You're gonna be fine, girlie.

1101
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:42,720
Daddy's gonna meet me there.
Take care of your brother.

1102
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:46,203
- Yeah.
- Okay. All right.

1103
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:04,810
Did Daisy really bite Mom?

1104
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:09,603
Well, um... she was whimpering.

1105
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:13,803
And then Mom tried to pick her up
and Daisy bit her.

1106
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,524
Do you think the vet can fix her?

1107
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:21,243
She was in a lot of pain, Auggie.

1108
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:24,961
She's really old.

1109
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:30,762
Auggie?

1110
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:35,605
I want you to come to my play. Okay?

1111
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:38,487
Really?

1112
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:40,722
Really.

1113
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:59,049
Every time I came home
from the hospital, Daisy was here.

1114
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,125
She was a real friend.

1115
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:09,921
And real friends... are hard to find.

1116
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,210
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

1117
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:02,601
Thank you.

1118
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:07,726
This is perfect.

1119
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,723
Here we go. Good seats.

1120
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,928
See if you can find
Via's name in there, honey.

1121
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:17,041
Glasses. Oh, no!
I think I forgot my glasses.

1122
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:20,884
Auggie, you're missing a great episode
of Hoarders, right here.

1123
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,004
Starring your mom's purse.

1124
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,367
You ready?

1125
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,204
Are you supposed to be
in the girls' dressing room?

1126
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:31,891
Just wanted to wish you good luck.

1127
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:33,965
"Break a leg," not “good luck."

1128
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:35,482
You too.

1129
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,160
Anyone cheering you on tonight?

1130
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,204
Uh, yeah...

1131
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,289
my mom invited the entire block.

1132
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:46,811
It's gonna be really embarrassing.

1133
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:49,362
YOU?

1134
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,844
Uh, my dad is on his belated honeymoon

1135
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:54,491
and my mom's in a funk,

1136
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,562
but maybe she'll come tomorrow.

1137
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,285
Well, um, Via's family will cheer you on.

1138
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:05,521
You'll be great tonight.

1139
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:19,763
- Honey, just enjoy the play.
- Okay.

1140
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:24,801
All right, go get them.

1141
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:27,766
- Mr. Davenport...
- Hmm?

1142
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,808
I'm really sorry,
but I can't go on tonight.

1143
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:31,564
I don't feel well.
I think I might throw up.

1144
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,927
Okay, everybody gets nervous.
You know, when I did my Hamlet,

1145
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,809
I threw up every night.
You're gonna be fine.

1146
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:37,803
Just do it.
You'll have of spring break to recover.

1147
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,882
Mr. Davenport, you're not listening.
I'm not going on.

1148
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:45,567
Are you kidding me?

1149
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,931
I'm really sorry, but Via knows
all the lines. She can do it.

1150
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,285
Then go find her then.

1151
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:54,602
Thank you.

1152
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:00,044
- Hi.
- Hi.

1153
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:12,961
This play is called Our Town.

1154
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,609
It was written by Thornton Wilder.

1155
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:20,970
The name of our town
is Grover's Corners, New Hampshire.

1156
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:24,127
Just across the Massachusetts line.

1157
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:25,531
Is this-- Is this really happening?

1158
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,251
Yes, you're going on as Emily.
Only we don't have much time.

1159
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,800
Well, I don't even know
if I'm gonna remember all of my lines.

1160
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,484
You'll be great.
Justin will help you through it.

1161
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:33,527
Where is she?

1162
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:35,845
Via, you're on in two minutes.

1163
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:37,725
Why-- why are you doing this?

1164
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:41,122
- I told you... I feel sick.
- Okay.

1165
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:44,041
We've got a factory in our town too.

1166
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:46,121
You hear it?

1167
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:47,966
- Hey, it's okay.
- Makes blankets.

1168
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:49,568
Hey, break a leg.

1169
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:52,081
Cartwrights own it
and it brung them a fortune.

1170
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,329
Children, now I won't have it.

1171
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:01,408
Breakfast is just as good
as any other meal

1172
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,808
and I won't have you gobbling like wolves.

1173
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,530
It'll stunt your growth. That's a fact.

1174
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,684
Miranda looks so different.

1175
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,048
That's not Miranda, that's Via.

1176
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,450
- What?
- It's Via.

1177
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:14,681
Oh, great.

1178
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:19,522
As for me, I'd rather have
my children healthy than bright.

1179
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:22,202
I'm both, Mama, you know I am.

1180
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:25,402
I'm the brightest girl in school
for my age.

1181
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:27,050
I have a wonderful memory.

1182
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:29,005
Eat your breakfast.

1183
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,485
Hmm. Your stomach flu got better fast.

1184
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,130
Sorry, sir, just jitters.

1185
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:43,601
I'll be ready by tomorrow night.

1186
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:46,006
She's doing very well.

1187
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:53,761
I can't...

1188
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,240
I can't go on.

1189
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,570
It-- It goes so fast.

1190
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:04,522
We don't even have time
to look at one another.

1191
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:07,360
I didn't realize.

1192
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:10,405
So all that was going on
and we never noticed?

1193
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:17,724
Take me back... up the hill...
to my grave.

1194
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:20,321
But first...

1195
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:24,245
wait... one more look.

1196
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:30,842
Goodbye... Goodbye, world.

1197
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:35,163
Goodbye, Grover's Corners.

1198
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:37,721
Mama...

1199
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:39,967
and Papa.

1200
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:43,205
Goodbye to clocks ticking.

1201
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:46,887
And food.

1202
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:49,801
And coffee.

1203
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,005
And hot baths.

1204
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:55,406
And sleeping.

1205
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:58,880
And waking up.

1206
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:05,321
Oh, Earth...

1207
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,165
You're too wonderful
for anybody to realize you.

1208
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:17,600
Blow out the candles. Ready?

1209
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:18,681
Take a big breath.

1210
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:23,211
Ha! We did it.

1211
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:24,846
Did you make a wish?

1212
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,010
I wished for a brother.

1213
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:28,760
You did?

1214
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,362
Mm. Wow.

1215
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,208
Happy birthday, honey.

1216
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:04,121
Whoo!

1217
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,242
Via! Oh, my God!

1218
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:25,810
That was incredible!

1219
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:27,644
- It was just a play.
- It wasn't "just" anything.

1220
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:29,882
- You were amazing!
- You were great, Via! Amazing!

1221
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:30,961
Thanks, Auggie.

1222
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,643
- And then there was the nurse...
- Yeah.

1223
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:00,321
...who farted, and I don't use
that word a lot, about 100 times.

1224
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,846
Honey, that was you.

1225
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:06,606
To put it delicately.
I don't know how else to say it.

1226
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:07,761
It's-- It's not true.

1227
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,205
- Busted now!
- No, it's not--

1228
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:11,887
Anyone? Raise your hand
if you wanna change the subject

1229
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:13,200
and save us from this story.

1230
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:16,602
All right, I will. I will.
Um, what is that?

1231
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:20,844
Oh that is, uh, Jack and Auggie's
science fair project.

1232
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:23,446
Not to be confused with an eyesore
in the middle of the room.

1233
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:25,961
No, but what is it?

1234
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,890
Well, I don't know.
I guess it's like a... Uh, yeah.

1235
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,161
Follow me, you'll see.

1236
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,288
- Oh, okay.
- Come on!

1237
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:33,722
All right.

1238
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:36,089
- Sweet.
- What?

1239
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:38,686
Are you kidding me?
I cannot believe you just did that.

1240
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,047
- Go, go, go.
- Okay.

1241
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:42,521
But just no kissing.

1242
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,286
Seen a lotta horror movies end this way.

1243
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:49,002
We're gonna open the apertures in 3, 2, 1.

1244
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:56,247
It's a camera obscure.

1245
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:58,923
Yeah. He's ten.

1246
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:03,283
Oh, my God, that was so cool.

1247
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,362
Cinema history come to life.

1248
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:07,841
All right, people, single file.

1249
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:11,482
Step right up for an amazing
camera obscura.

1250
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:15,087
Step right up to witness
Earth's greatest mystery, the volcano.

1251
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:18,084
Okay, we're gonna open the apertures in...

1252
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:20,242
- 3, 2, 1!
- 3, 2, 1!

1253
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,922
- Whoa!
- That's awesome!

1254
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:34,371
Jack and Auggie.

1255
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,841
- Dude!
- Dude!

1256
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,325
- See, you have to go--
- No, I did.

1257
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:10,327
Okay, now I'll go.

1258
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,125
Let's go, let's go.

1259
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:30,727
Everybody get in here.

1260
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:31,926
Find your seats.

1261
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:35,486
We good today?
It's gonna be a good one, guys.

1262
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:39,130
All right. Everybody inside.

1263
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,770
Come on. New month, new precept.

1264
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,882
Look at him.

1265
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:44,406
Hey, where's Auggie?

1266
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,041
Right there.

1267
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:51,249
Hey, hey, hey.
Why are we running in the hallway?

1268
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,042
Auggie, you okay?

1269
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,483
Yeah. Everything's fine.

1270
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:04,806
I'm late for class.

1271
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:06,120
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

1272
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:09,048
Auggie, you know
if you need help you can ask for it.

1273
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,127
You're not alone.

1274
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:11,602
I know.

1275
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:19,921
Amos.

1276
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,810
You know something about this.

1277
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:31,881
You understand?

1278
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:36,208
We take bullying very seriously
at this school.

1279
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,090
There's zero tolerance.

1280
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:43,683
Excuse me, can you explain
what's going on here?

1281
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,087
Wasn't Julian the one
who got punched in the mouth?

1282
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:49,401
If there's any bullying
going on, it isn't my son.

1283
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:01,726
You wrote that, Julian?

1284
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:03,882
Yes, sir.

1285
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:07,243
That one note was on the back
of a class photo.

1286
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,002
Your son photoshopped Auggie out of it.

1287
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:18,601
No. No, he didn't. I did.

1288
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:21,642
Of course, I didn't think that
he would bring it to school.

1289
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:23,963
But when our friends come over
and they see that picture,

1290
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:26,407
I want them to ask about our son,
not the Pullmans'.

1291
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:28,641
Mrs. Albans.

1292
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,891
When we pressed Auggie,
he showed us these other notes...

1293
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:39,084
that your son left
in his locker and in his desk and...

1294
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:42,607
his chair.

1295
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:51,483
Okay, if no one else is gonna have the
courage to say it, then I guess I will.

1296
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,327
These kids are too young to be dealing
with this sort of thing.

1297
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:57,768
Julian has had nightmares
because of that kid.

1298
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:58,887
- Sarah.
- Did you know that?

1299
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,962
We had to take him to a child psychologist

1300
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,883
to help him deal with his night terrors.

1301
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:04,405
It's just a two-day suspension.

1302
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:08,806
You'll stay home from the nature
preserve trip. That's all.

1303
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:12,528
Two days for a couple of notes from a kid?

1304
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:16,401
After all the money that we have poured
into this school?

1305
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:19,167
We have a lot of friends on
the school board, Mr. Tushman.

1306
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:20,441
Oh.

1307
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:23,608
Well, I have more.

1308
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:25,565
So what would you have us do?

1309
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,728
Bend over backwards for every
single person in the world?

1310
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,761
Nobody can get their feelings hurt ever?

1311
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:34,969
You are not doing
these kids any favors.

1312
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:38,965
Mrs. Albans, Auggie
can't change the way he looks.

1313
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:44,369
So, maybe we can change the way we see.

1314
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:54,406
Yes. I will be sure to tell that
to the real world.

1315
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:59,161
Thank you for this.
We won't be back in the fall.

1316
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,967
Mom. I like this school.

1317
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:08,843
Mom, Mom. I have friends, Dad.

1318
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:09,967
Let's go, Julian.

1319
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,202
Come on.

1320
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:20,601
Mr. Tushman.

1321
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:25,321
I'm really sorry.

1322
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:29,521
I know you are, Julian.

1323
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:48,567
He's not even looking at us.

- The sound of joy!
- Ah.

1346
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:29,687
All right. I want you to close your eyes,
because I have a surprise for you.

1347
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:33,850
Do you take requests?

1348
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:36,561
Not before 9:45.

1349
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:38,481
Okay-

1350
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:40,681
Open your eyes.

1351
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:46,600
- No! Are you... You finished your thesis!
- Let's get drunk.

1352
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:49,411
Yes! Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

1353
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:54,289
Wait a minute.
The double surprise, surprise.

1354
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:57,564
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

1355
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,049
- Nothing's gonna jump out at me, is it?
- No.

1356
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:02,970
Giving me the eyes.

1357
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:05,042
What's in here? I'm kind of scared--

1358
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:09,361
Good, right?

1359
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:12,248
I'm just gonna keep that
in the box for now.

1360
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:15,405
Does that merit a kiss? Come here.

1361
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:17,681
More than a kiss.

1362
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:19,322
Thank you.

1363
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:25,080
All right, kids! Let's give a big
warm welcome to the William Heath School,

1364
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:28,602
The Glover Academy and Beecher Prep!

1365
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:30,729
Last chance to get popcorn!

1366
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:32,450
- Hello.
- Okay!

1367
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:36,362
Well, welcome to the 23rd annual

1368
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:40,331
Big Movie Saturday in the
Broarwood Nature Reserve!

1369
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:43,161
Whoo!

1370
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:45,924
Tonight's movie will be...

1371
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:47,531
The Wizard of Oz!

1372
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:49,881
Yay!

1373
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:54,288
Hey, dude.
You wanna go outside?

1374
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:55,522
Why?

1375
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:57,563
We can watch this movie any time.

1376
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:13,401
Dude!

1377
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:16,284
Aw, man, I need to pee.

1378
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:17,961
Wanna go back?

1379
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:20,046
Nah, I'll just go over here.

1380
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,642
Like in the subways? That's gross.

1381
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:24,922
No. This is gross.

1382
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:35,561
Look at that.

1383
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:37,847
What? What are you looking at?

1384
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:41,684
I'm going up there someday.

1385
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:44,881
Well, I'm going down here right now, so...

1386
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:46,481
I gotta go too now.

1387
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:50,328
You go there. I'll go here. Don't look.

1388
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:53,166
What do we got here?

1389
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:55,682
Couple of losers stinking up the woods.

1390
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:00,521
Holy crap! Look at his face!

1391
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:03,683
He's a freak! Jesus, I've never
seen anything that ugly in my life.

1392
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:05,241
Maybe it's an orc.

1393
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:06,731
- Dude, let's go.
- Go where?

1394
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,325
Hey, talking to you, Gollum.

1395
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,971
Is this the one mask to rule them all?
My precious.

1396
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:13,086
Hey, what's your problem?

1397
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:18,801
Your boyfriend's my problem.

1398
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:21,121
Hey! Leave him alone.

1399
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:23,131
What are you gonna do about it?

1400
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:25,886
- Get outta my way.
- No.

1401
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:27,811
I said get outta my way!

1402
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:29,245
I said no!

1403
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:31,604
Yo, Jack, what's up, man?

1404
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:33,686
What's this? More little freaks?

1405
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:35,046
What you call us, hick?

1406
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:36,361
Come on, prep boy.

1407
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:40,681
Guys, stop!

1408
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:43,921
Guys, Stop!

1409
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:46,521
Guys, stop!

1410
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:49,320
Just stop, please! Stop!

1411
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:51,368
Just go!

1412
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:59,285
Oh, man! Dude! Come on! Let's go!

1413
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:00,721
Let's get out!

1414
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:11,450
- Are you okay?
- Uh...

1415
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:13,120
Dude, you're bleeding.

1416
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:16,531
What was that? Something's coming.

1417
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:20,688
- Amos?
- Jack!

1418
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:22,569
- Over here!
- Amos, come on!

1419
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,281
They following you?

1420
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,041
I think we lost them.

1421
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,041
Whoa!

1422
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:36,203
How did you guys
know we needed help?

1423
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,130
We saw them follow you out of the lodge.

1424
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:41,124
I think they were seventh graders.
They were huge.

1425
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:43,005
Thanks, guys.

1426
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:45,969
You totally saved our butts.

1427
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:47,366
Yeah, thanks, guys.

1428
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:54,282
You know, it was cool
how you stood your ground, little dude.

Hi!

1440
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:23,450
Oh, my gosh, I missed you so much! Mm.

1441
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:24,521
See you later, Auggie!

1442
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:26,291
- Bye!
- How are you?

1443
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,324
Good. And guess what? I got in a fight.

1444
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:31,131
Oh my God,
you're bleeding! Are you okay?

1445
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:32,087
What happened?

1446
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:33,491
- Auggie got in a fight.
- What?

1447
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:36,486
That's terrible. I'm sorry.

1448
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:39,123
- Did you win?
- Nate!

1449
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:41,567
Well, I'm getting a vibe
like maybe he won.

1450
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:43,807
Did you?

1451
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:47,009
Yeah. And guess what?
They were seventh graders.

1452
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:48,961
Yes!

1453
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:50,766
See you later, buddy!

1454
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:51,841
Bye!

1455
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:55,444
Fighting is bad, Auggie.

1456
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:57,807
- Bye, Mr. and Mrs. P.
- Goodbye.

1457
01:38:57,880 --> 01:38:59,564
See you at graduation, Auggie.

1458
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:06,003
Looking sharp.

1459
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:08,404
- Thanks, Dad.
- I'm talking about me.

1460
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,446
Oh, hey! Ah, you look good too.

1461
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:16,562
I think it's safe to say the Pullman men
are crushing it today.

1462
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:22,811
- You've come a long way, huh?
- Yeah.

1463
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:29,488
Auggie, I am proud of you
for sticking it out.

1464
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:31,165
You didn't think I would, did you?

1465
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:32,241
Of course I did.

1466
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:37,046
Okay, well, come on, you gotta--

1467
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:38,849
I mean, when you started
you were still wearing

1468
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:40,809
the astronaut helmet in public.

1469
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:45,043
I love that helmet.
I wish I knew where it was.

1470
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:49,721
It's in my office.

1471
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:53,722
What? Dad! That was a gift.
You had no right to hide it!

1472
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:55,683
Auggie, Auggie, please, don't be mad.

1473
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:58,929
You gotta understand,
you were wearing it all the time.

1474
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:00,885
I never got to see you anymore.

1475
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:02,450
I missed your face.

1476
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:05,728
I know you don't always like it,
but I love it.

1477
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:07,850
It's my son's face.

1478
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:12,606
I wanna see it.

1479
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,081
Can you forgive me?

1480
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:18,402
No.

1481
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:22,362
Yes.

1482
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:25,607
Does Mom know?

1483
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:28,001
No. God, no, she'd kill me.

1484
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:31,929
But I can maybe find it,
if you need it back.

1485
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:33,201
That's okay.

1486
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:47,243
Follow the day

1487
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:51,571
Follow the day and reach for the sun!

1488
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:55,008
You don't see me flying to the red

1489
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:57,606
One more you're done

1490
01:40:58,120 --> 01:41:00,088
Just follow the day...

1491
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:01,844
- Mom.
- Yes?

1492
01:41:02,120 --> 01:41:03,167
Thank you.

1493
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:07,521
- For what?
- Making me go to school.

1494
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:12,924
I was so mad at you sometimes.

1495
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:15,050
But I'm really happy to be here.

1496
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:19,564
You really are a wonder, Auggie.

1497
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:22,771
You are a wonder.

1498
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,322
Follow the day

1499
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:32,162
Follow the day and reach for the sun!

1500
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:44,971
Whew!

1501
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:49,089
Thank you, choir. That was beautiful.

1502
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:56,450
Ladies, gentlemen,
boys and girls, graduates.

1503
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:02,365
Final award this morning
is the Henry Ward Beecher medal

1504
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:08,366
to honor students
who have been notable or exemplary.

1505
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:14,326
Usually, it's a "good works..."
a service award.

1506
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:17,726
But I came upon a passage that he wrote,

1507
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:24,727
which made me realize that good works...
come in many forms.

1508
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:32,205
"Greatness," he wrote,
"lies not in being strong

1509
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:37,081
but in the right using of strength.

1510
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:41,563
He or she is the greatest...

1511
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:46,325
whose strength carries up the most hearts

1512
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:50,289
by the attraction of his own."

1513
01:42:54,160 --> 01:43:00,008
Without further ado...
this year, I am very proud

1514
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:04,282
to award the Henry Ward Beecher medal

1515
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:08,926
to the student whose quiet strength

1516
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:12,082
has carried up the most hearts.

1517
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:14,161
So,

1518
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:18,766
will August Pullman please come up here
to receive this award?

1519
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:26,491
Whoo!

1520
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,650
You're the best, dude!

1521
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:03,451
Walking up towards that stage,
I felt like I was floating.

1522
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,082
My heart was beating so fast.

1523
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:09,161
I didn't really understand
why I was getting a medal.

1524
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:12,161
It's not like I blew up the Death Star.

1525
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:17,411
All I did was get through fifth grade,
just like everyone else here.

1526
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:18,567
Congratulations.

1527
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,570
Here you go. That's for you.

1528
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:25,487
Then again, maybe
that's kind of the point.

1529
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:30,450
Maybe the truth is,
I'm really not so ordinary.

1530
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:35,086
Maybe if we knew
what other people were thinking

1531
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:37,242
we'd know that no one's ordinary.

1532
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:42,009
And we all deserve a standing ovation
at least once in our lives.

1533
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:44,961
My friends do.

1534
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,001
My teachers do.

1535
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:54,921
My sister does
for always being there for me.

1536
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:59,005
My dad does for always making us laugh.

1537
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:02,125
And my mom does the most.

1538
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:05,131
For never giving up... on anything.

1539
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:06,561
Especially, me.

1540
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:11,285
It's like that last precept
Mr. Browne gave us.

1541
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:15,969
Be kind, for everyone
is fighting a hard battle.

1542
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:19,168
And if you really wanna see
what people are,

1543
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:21,880
all you have to do...

1544
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:24,681
is look.
