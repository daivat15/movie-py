00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,320
- I'm Statler.
- I'm Waldorf.

00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:07,456
<i>We're here to heckle
The Muppet Movie.</i>

4
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:10,297
That's straight ahead,
private screening room "D."

5
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:14,533
- Private screening?
- They're afraid to show it in public!

6
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:18,510
Look at this place.
What a dump!

7
00:01:18,577 --> 00:01:21,239
Bunch of weirdos around here.
Look at 'em.

8
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:26,012
- Yes, I know you all want to...
- Lady, is this seat taken?

9
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:29,452
What... Hey, you!
Bring that back!

10
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:34,049
I'm so nervous. If I'm not funny,
I won't be able to live with myself.

11
00:01:34,126 --> 00:01:37,118
Well, then you'll have to get
another apartment, won't you?

12
00:01:37,196 --> 00:01:40,632
I hear this movie is dynamite.

13
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:44,328
Get your fresh organic popcorn,
only a buck.

14
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:47,338
- Buy me some, please.
- Sure, Mama.

15
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:53,276
- Nothin's too good for my woman.
- Woman! Woman! Woman!

16
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:56,576
- I like the movie fine so far.
- It hasn't started yet.

17
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,913
That's what I like about it!

18
00:02:01,453 --> 00:02:02,943
Do it!

19
00:02:05,724 --> 00:02:08,090
Oh, hey, Mr. Defrog!

20
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,358
Is it okay for me and my boomerang fish
to be in your movie?

21
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:13,659
Hey!

22
00:02:13,732 --> 00:02:16,530
I told you, Luke, not in the movie
or at the screening.

23
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:18,934
Hey, but watch.

24
00:02:19,004 --> 00:02:22,872
Kermit, does this film have
socially redeeming value?

25
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:25,172
I certainly hope so, Sam.

26
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:27,075
Sorry about that.

27
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:30,013
- Kermie!
- Hi, Piggy.

28
00:02:30,082 --> 00:02:32,915
I tried to save you a seat,
but somebody took it.

29
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:36,853
<i>Hi, everybody, and welcome to
the first screening of The Muppet Movie.</i>

30
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:43,454
But before we begin, I'd like to thank
everyone who contributed to this film...

31
00:02:43,529 --> 00:02:46,054
starting with the little people,
from the hairdressers...

32
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:47,962
to special effects...

33
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:53,161
- That's enough of that, Harry!
- Blow it up! Blow it up!

34
00:02:54,506 --> 00:02:57,737
To the costume designers,
to the prop makers...

35
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,906
Speeches are not necessary, dear.
Roll the film.

36
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:03,710
But I'd like
to thank everybody...

37
00:03:03,782 --> 00:03:07,013
for all of their hard work
and patience...

38
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:09,554
Roll film! Roll film!

39
00:03:09,621 --> 00:03:11,521
Roll film!

40
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,899
Excuse me.

41
00:03:27,973 --> 00:03:32,433
Uncle Kermit, is this about how
the Muppets really got started?

42
00:03:32,511 --> 00:03:36,208
Well, it's sort of
approximately how it happened.

43
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:50,886
<i>Why are there so many</i>

44
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:53,925
<i>Songs about rainbows</i>

45
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:58,554
<i>And what's on the other side</i>

46
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:03,266
<i>Rainbows are visions</i>

47
00:05:03,335 --> 00:05:06,361
<i>But only illusions</i>

48
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:11,137
<i>And rainbows have nothing to hide</i>

49
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:14,971
<i>So we've been told</i>

50
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:19,074
<i>And some choose to believe it</i>

51
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:23,645
<i>I know they're wrong
Wait and see</i>

52
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,426
<i>Someday we'll find it</i>

53
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,486
<i>The rainbow connection</i>

54
00:05:31,563 --> 00:05:36,159
<i>The lovers, the dreamers and me</i>

55
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:43,970
<i>Who said that every wish</i>

56
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:47,011
<i>Would be heard and answered</i>

57
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:51,778
<i>When wished on the morning star</i>

58
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,511
<i>Somebody thought of that</i>

59
00:05:56,588 --> 00:05:59,853
<i>And someone believed it</i>

60
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:04,294
<i>Look what it's done so far</i>

61
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:08,625
<i>What's so amazing</i>

62
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,136
<i>That keeps us stargazing</i>

63
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:16,732
<i>And what do we think
we might see</i>

64
00:06:18,477 --> 00:06:21,412
<i>Someday we'll find it</i>

65
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,608
<i>The rainbow connection</i>

66
00:06:24,683 --> 00:06:29,518
<i>The lovers, the dreamers and me</i>

67
00:06:29,588 --> 00:06:33,718
<i>All of us under its spell</i>

68
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:37,353
<i>We know that it's probably</i>

69
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:42,128
<i>Magic</i>

70
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:45,068
<i>Have you been half asleep</i>

71
00:06:45,137 --> 00:06:47,571
<i>And have you heard voices</i>

72
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:52,810
<i>I've heard them calling my name</i>

73
00:06:54,346 --> 00:06:57,406
<i>Is this the sweet sound</i>

74
00:06:57,482 --> 00:07:00,610
<i>That calls the young sailors</i>

75
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:05,350
<i>The voice might be one and the same</i>

76
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,526
<i>I've heard it too many times</i>

77
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,996
<i>To ignore it</i>

78
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:17,764
<i>It's something
that I'm supposed to be</i>

79
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:22,373
<i>Someday we'll find it</i>

80
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:25,342
<i>The rainbow connection</i>

81
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:30,438
<i>The lovers, the dreamers and me</i>

82
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,594
Help! Hello!
This is a serious call for help.

83
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:53,529
- Yeah?
- Someone help!

84
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:01,304
You with the banjo,
can you help me?

85
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,507
I have lost
my sense of direction.

86
00:08:03,582 --> 00:08:05,209
Have you tried Hare Krishna?

87
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:08,986
No, I mean, I'm really lost!

88
00:08:09,054 --> 00:08:12,922
One second.
Darn, I missed.

89
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:15,551
That's the first thing
to go on a frog, his tongue.

90
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:17,891
The tongue goes and you
can't catch flies.

91
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:21,660
I'm sorry about your tongue,
but I have to get out of this swamp.

92
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:25,191
- I have to catch a plane.
- With that tongue? No way.

93
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:30,265
- There's a boat dock just downstream.
- Thank you.

94
00:08:30,342 --> 00:08:33,937
- Just watch out for the alligators.
- I will.

95
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:35,843
- Alligators?
- That's right.

96
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:40,408
- Did you say alligators?
- Read my lips... alligators.

97
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:43,113
I'm not used to alligators
where I come from.

98
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:47,386
See, I'm an agent.
I winged in from Hollywood.

99
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,222
- Hollywood?
- That's right.

100
00:08:49,294 --> 00:08:53,390
- Did you say Hollywood?
- Read my lips... Hollywood.

101
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:57,026
<i>You know... Hollywood
The dream factory. The magic store.</i>

102
00:08:57,102 --> 00:08:59,662
Hey, don't you ever
go to the movies?

103
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:02,605
Sure, there's a double feature
in town every Saturday.

104
00:09:03,942 --> 00:09:06,809
- Wait a minute.
- What?

105
00:09:06,878 --> 00:09:10,712
There's an ad in here that you
should be very interested in.

106
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:15,013
Feast your eyes on that.

107
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:18,921
"World Wide Studios announces
open auditions for frogs...

108
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,719
wishing to become rich and famous."

109
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:25,058
Thanks anyway, but I'm really
pretty happy where I am.

110
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:29,362
If I were you, I would give this
audition very careful consideration.

111
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:32,062
You've got talent, kid...
singin', tellin'jokes.

112
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:34,605
I mean, if you get your tongue fixed,
who knows?

113
00:09:34,673 --> 00:09:36,607
You could make
millions of people happy.

114
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:39,510
Millions of people happy.

115
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:42,103
Millions!
If you ever come west...

116
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,377
to Hollywood, look me up...
Bernie, the agent.

117
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,817
Listen, Bernie the agent, why don't
you say hello to Arnie the alligator?

118
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:51,522
- What!
- Arnie!

119
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:57,989
- Arnie, wait a minute. Careful.
- Stay! Stay!

120
00:09:58,063 --> 00:10:02,329
Arnie, leave him alone.
He's from Hollywood.

121
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,172
Hollywood. Gee.

122
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:14,508
Well, I'd miss
this old swamp, but...

123
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:16,479
millions of people happy.

124
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:48,646
What the...

125
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:51,773
Okay, you guys,
do what I tell you.

126
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,715
I don't know where your...

127
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:56,754
Don't step on that asphalt!

128
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,052
We gotta get this...
Off the asphalt!

129
00:10:59,124 --> 00:11:02,525
I told you, stay off the asphalt!
Hey, look at him.

130
00:11:06,064 --> 00:11:09,363
- What are those big legs?
- Hey, you on the bike!

131
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:12,130
Watch out! Watch out!

132
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,104
Oh, my gosh!

133
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:23,373
That's pretty dangerous, building a road
in the middle of the street.

134
00:11:23,448 --> 00:11:27,077
I mean, if frogs couldn't hop,
I'd be gone with the Schwinn.

135
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:32,089
"The El Sleezo Cafe."

136
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,994
Foreign food.

137
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:43,330
Doesn't smell promising, but...

138
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:45,562
a frog's gotta eat.

139
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:55,241
Wow.

140
00:11:59,284 --> 00:12:00,717
Rough place, huh?

141
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,779
That the toughest, meanest, filthiest
pest hole on the face of the Earth!

142
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:09,691
- Why not complain to the owner?
- I am the owner.

143
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,544
Watch out. Hot plates
comin' through. Look out.

144
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:37,110
You got your french-fried
frog legs au gratin...

145
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:39,986
you got your frog legs almandine,
you got your frog legs stroganoff.

146
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:42,151
Everybody happy?
All right.

147
00:12:51,536 --> 00:12:54,699
Hello, sailor.
Buy me a drink?

148
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,673
I'm not a sailor, I'm a frog.

149
00:12:56,741 --> 00:13:00,575
- Cut the small talk and buy me a drink.
- I don't even know you.

150
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:03,944
Hey, you makin'
a move on my girl?

151
00:13:04,015 --> 00:13:06,950
- No, sir.
- He did too. He touched me.

152
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:09,077
Go wash!
You'll get warts.

153
00:13:09,154 --> 00:13:12,351
- No, that's just a myth.
- Yeah, but she's my "mith"!

154
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,016
No, no, myth, myth!

155
00:13:14,092 --> 00:13:17,584
- Yes?
- What the hey?

156
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:24,163
Show time!
Show time at the El Sleezo.

157
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:30,968
And now, filling in for the vacationing
El Sleezo dancing girls...

158
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:34,273
the funny, furry, fabulous...

159
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:37,338
Fozzie Bear!

160
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:47,053
You're a great crowd!
Thank you, thank you and thank you!

161
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:54,562
Here I am, Fozzie Bear,
to tell you jokes both old and rare!

162
00:13:58,503 --> 00:14:00,095
Get off the stage!

163
00:14:00,171 --> 00:14:03,902
Let's start things off
with a bang!

164
00:14:03,975 --> 00:14:06,739
Thank you, sir.

165
00:14:06,811 --> 00:14:09,541
This guy's lost.

166
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:11,707
Maybe he should try
Hare Krishna.

167
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:15,252
Good grief.
It's a running gag.

168
00:14:17,722 --> 00:14:19,952
There was this sailor
who was so fat...

169
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,619
How fat was he?

170
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:26,630
He was so fat
that everybody liked him...

171
00:14:26,698 --> 00:14:29,166
and there was nothing
funny about him at all.

172
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:32,296
No problem!

173
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,362
Please!
Oh, please!

174
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,341
I'm trying so hard.
Please don't get mad.

175
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,937
I'm a professional.
I've had three performances.

176
00:14:42,013 --> 00:14:44,004
- Curtain! Curtain!
- Do you know any dance routines?

177
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:46,642
What? Not really. Do you?

178
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:50,210
- Play something snappy.
- You got it.

179
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:55,252
- Now dance!
- What?

180
00:14:55,326 --> 00:14:56,759
Dance!

181
00:15:07,972 --> 00:15:10,133
It's too bad the dancing girls
are on vacation.

182
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,836
The crowd is getting ugly.

183
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:16,039
You think this crowd's ugly,
you should see the dancing girls!

184
00:15:20,952 --> 00:15:23,477
Two, three, four.

185
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,156
- Two, three, kick!
- Kick. Yeah, sorry.

186
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:33,590
Comin' home!

187
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,409
I just cleaned the fur, please!

188
00:16:09,634 --> 00:16:13,195
I hope you appreciate that
I'm doing all my own stunts.

189
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:22,572
Okay, everybody,
drinks on the house!

190
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:28,447
- Drinks on the house!
- Yeah! Go, go! On the house!

191
00:16:34,492 --> 00:16:36,551
I don't see no drinks up here.
What's he talkin' about?

192
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,892
The bartender said there
were drinks on the house.

193
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:46,226
- Works every time.
- Huh. Wow.

194
00:16:46,304 --> 00:16:49,831
My name is Kermit the Frog,
and I'm on my way to Hollywood.

195
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,603
- Hollywood?
- You want to join me?

196
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:55,271
Big-time show biz!
That's always been my dream.

197
00:16:55,346 --> 00:16:58,247
They're holding auditions
for frogs next week.

198
00:16:58,316 --> 00:17:01,945
And if they need frogs,
they must need bears too.

199
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,011
My car's right outside!

200
00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:09,159
Gee, a Studebaker.
Where'd you get it?

201
00:17:09,227 --> 00:17:11,821
- My uncle left it to me.
- Is he dead?

202
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:13,830
No, he's hibernating.

203
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:32,246
You know, Fozzie, you really
do have a lot of talent.

204
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:36,617
- Thank you.
- How about we put together an act?

205
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:39,953
Nope. Sorry.
I only work as a single.

206
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:41,958
Okay.

207
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:49,164
All right, you talked me into it!
We'll be a team!

208
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,862
- Oh, good.
- What's this?

209
00:17:51,936 --> 00:17:54,336
- You better pull over here.
- Yes, sir.

210
00:17:59,544 --> 00:18:01,478
Hey, what's goin' on?

211
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:05,415
Howdy, Mr. Frog.

212
00:18:05,483 --> 00:18:08,350
- I'm a businessman with a proposition.
- What?

213
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:11,786
Let me show you somethin' that
might change your whole life.

214
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:18,323
Hop right over here,
my little green friend.

215
00:18:18,396 --> 00:18:21,888
- Listen, mister...
- That's it.

216
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:25,060
This is the kind of chance
you can't afford to pass up.

217
00:18:25,937 --> 00:18:29,873
Now, now, don't be afraid.
Watch the window.

218
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:32,975
What's that?

219
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,506
<i>Hi, I'm Doc Hopper...</i>

220
00:18:36,581 --> 00:18:40,745
<i>invitin'you to hop on down and get
some Hopper's french-fried frog legs...</i>

221
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:44,618
<i>right here, at the sign
of the bright green legs!</i>

222
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:46,486
Good grief!

223
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:49,185
<i>Hurry, hurry, hurry.</i>

224
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,785
<i>Frog legs, frog legs
Frog legs so fine</i>

225
00:18:51,863 --> 00:18:54,627
<i>Hopper's is the place
you should dine</i>

226
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:57,725
<i>There's cheese legs
bacon legs, chili legs too</i>

227
00:18:57,802 --> 00:19:01,397
<i>- French-fried frog legs, barbecued
- Oh, Fozzie.</i>

228
00:19:01,472 --> 00:19:04,407
<i>- If you want just a snack
- Don't worry.</i>

229
00:19:04,475 --> 00:19:07,444
<i>Then here is the one</i>

230
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:10,675
<i>A frog-leg burger
on a bright green bun</i>

231
00:19:13,751 --> 00:19:18,313
That is terrible! That's the most
revolting thing I've ever seen!

232
00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:20,755
I know. I'm a great businessman
and a sweet fella...

233
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:22,793
but I do lack the skills
of a performer.

234
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,828
You also make a lousy frog!

235
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:27,729
You, on the other hand,
make a terrific frog!

236
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,825
- What?
- He's right. You are very likable.

237
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:33,837
The bear's right.
You, my little likable friend...

238
00:19:33,905 --> 00:19:36,237
are gonna do all our
television commercials!

239
00:19:36,307 --> 00:19:38,832
- No way!
- Just a minute.

240
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,141
There's $500 in it for you,
up front.

241
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:45,910
$500 is just the beginnin'.

242
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:49,078
You could be earnin'
this much every year.

243
00:19:49,153 --> 00:19:53,146
- Let's go, Fozzie.
- $500?

244
00:19:53,224 --> 00:19:55,590
Would you consider
a bear in a frog suit?

245
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,629
- Fozzie!
- I just lost my head.

246
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:02,154
Just a minute, Mr. Frog.
Everything's negotiable.

247
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:06,693
- Okay, here we go. Sorry!
- Hey, that's my Caddy!

248
00:20:06,771 --> 00:20:10,070
- Just get it in gear, Fozzie!
- Yes, sir. Here we go!

249
00:20:10,141 --> 00:20:13,304
This is money we're talkin' about.
Max!

250
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:17,180
Follow that frog!

251
00:20:18,349 --> 00:20:19,782
Max!

252
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:27,087
Follow that frog
with me in the car!

253
00:20:27,158 --> 00:20:31,458
I'm sorry, Doc, I just got excited.
Isn't the frog terrific?

254
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:34,327
- Terrific. Now go!
- But you promised me a reward.

255
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,391
Later, Max.
Now follow that frog!

256
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,376
- It's a gorgeous day.
- Yep, certainly is.

257
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:49,243
- Yep, terrific day for a drive.
- Beautiful country out here.

258
00:20:49,313 --> 00:20:52,214
A frog and a bear,
seeing America!

Fozzie, turn left if you
come to a fork in the road.

273
00:21:38,329 --> 00:21:40,763
Yes, sir, turn left at
the fork in the road.

274
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:44,996
- Turn left!
- I don't believe that.

a Studebaker.

00:22:31,949 --> 00:22:35,407
- Hey, Fozzie, look up ahead.
- What is that?

289
00:22:35,486 --> 00:22:37,249
Maybe we should give him a ride.

290
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:40,222
I don't know, he's pretty big.

- No, thanks.

00:24:00,638 --> 00:24:01,900
Kermit, that's you!

310
00:24:04,508 --> 00:24:06,976
You got the picture, boy?
You see what I mean?

311
00:24:07,044 --> 00:24:11,310
Kermit the Frog, symbol of
Doc Hopper's French-Fried Frog Legs.

312
00:24:11,382 --> 00:24:15,716
Isn't that splendid?
Just take a look at it.

313
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:19,187
All I can see are millions
of frogs on tiny crutches.

314
00:24:20,124 --> 00:24:24,220
Now listen, boy, don't you
want to be rich and famous?

315
00:24:24,295 --> 00:24:26,229
- Not workin' for you, I don't!
- That's right.

316
00:24:26,297 --> 00:24:29,698
- Crutches?
- Shut up, Max!

317
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:31,701
We're a small-time operation...

318
00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:35,569
but we're expandin',
just like you frogs expand!

319
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,201
- Don't you frogs expand?
- That's a myth!

320
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:41,768
- What?
- Myth, myth!

321
00:24:41,846 --> 00:24:43,575
Yes?

322
00:24:46,984 --> 00:24:48,611
- Burn rubber.
- Yes, sir.

323
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:52,518
Hey, frog!

324
00:24:54,425 --> 00:24:56,393
That's the second time!

325
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,985
Max, I've done
my best with that frog.

326
00:24:59,063 --> 00:25:01,258
Now's the time to do my worst.
Open the door.

327
00:25:01,332 --> 00:25:03,232
- No, you open the door!
- What?

328
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:05,769
I'm through, Doc.
The frog is right.

329
00:25:05,836 --> 00:25:08,516
You're asking him to do something
terrible. I can't be a part of it.

330
00:25:08,572 --> 00:25:10,699
It's a moral decision,
and I'll stand by it!

331
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:13,403
- I'll double your percentage.
- I'll open the door.

332
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:21,510
- Kermit, where are we?
- Well, let's see.

333
00:25:21,585 --> 00:25:24,748
We were just travelling down
this little black line here...

334
00:25:24,822 --> 00:25:27,814
and we just crossed that
little red line over there.

335
00:25:27,892 --> 00:25:30,258
Let's take the blue line, huh?

336
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:34,162
- We can't take that. That's a river.
- I knew that.

337
00:25:34,231 --> 00:25:38,167
- Yeah, sure.
- Listen, why don't we just go...

338
00:25:38,235 --> 00:25:39,668
- Fozzie?
- Yeah?

339
00:25:39,737 --> 00:25:41,170
Who's driving?

340
00:25:44,508 --> 00:25:47,773
- Look out! Stop!
- No problem!

341
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,848
- Okay, back it up.
- Yes, sir.

342
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:53,474
Fozzie, where did you
learn to drive?

343
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:56,111
I took a correspondence course.

344
00:25:58,589 --> 00:26:01,683
- This looks like a nice, quiet spot.
- Uh-huh.

345
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:07,621
It feels like we've been
driving for days.

346
00:26:07,698 --> 00:26:11,395
- Funny, I'm still wide awake.
- Me too.

347
00:26:14,805 --> 00:26:16,397
Me too.

348
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,479
I'm up! I'm up!

349
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,812
What's that?

350
00:26:35,459 --> 00:26:37,859
They don't look like
Presbyterians to me.

351
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:53,167
Hey, cool it, everybody!

352
00:26:56,113 --> 00:27:00,516
Our gentle mornin' melodies have
attracted wanderin' admirers.

353
00:27:00,584 --> 00:27:04,145
- Hey, who are you guys?
- We am, is, are and be...

354
00:27:04,221 --> 00:27:07,952
they whom as are known as
the Electric Mayhem.

355
00:27:08,025 --> 00:27:09,720
For sure!

356
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,126
He's Dr. Teeth!

357
00:27:12,196 --> 00:27:16,565
Golden teeth and golden tones.
Welcome to my presence.

358
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,693
- Thank you.
- Fozzie...

359
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:20,794
I'm Floyd.
I blow bass.

360
00:27:20,871 --> 00:27:23,704
And I'm...

361
00:27:23,774 --> 00:27:25,742
Zoot.
Sax is your axe.

362
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,802
Uh-oh, Zoot skipped a groove again.

363
00:27:28,879 --> 00:27:32,781
Wow, like, I'm Janice
on lead guitar, for sure.

364
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,418
That's Animal.
Show 'em what you do, Animal!

365
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:43,290
I want to eat drums!

366
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,851
No, no, beat drums!
Beat drums!

367
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:50,065
Beat drums! Beat drums!

368
00:27:51,268 --> 00:27:55,534
- Down, Animal! Back! Sit!
- Down, back, sit!

369
00:27:55,606 --> 00:27:58,473
Hey, don't forget about me.

370
00:27:58,542 --> 00:28:00,874
I'm Scooter,
the band's road manager.

371
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:04,403
Yeah, we couldn't go
anywhere without him.

372
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:07,815
- He's the man with the contacts?
- No, he's the man with the van!

373
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,583
We're takin' this old church
and turnin' it into a coffee house.

374
00:28:12,656 --> 00:28:16,888
Yeah, with real good music
and organic refreshments.

375
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:21,398
Boy, it'll be so fine and laid back
and mellow and profitable.

376
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:25,226
Yeah, but what
brings you dudes here?

377
00:28:25,302 --> 00:28:28,863
Listen, see, Kermit here
was living in the swamp.

378
00:28:28,939 --> 00:28:30,873
- Fozzie...
- Then a fisherman came along.

379
00:28:30,941 --> 00:28:34,206
You can't tell 'em the whole story.
You'll bore the audience.

380
00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:38,514
Oh, sorry.
But, Kermit.

381
00:28:38,582 --> 00:28:41,949
- The band here wants to know.
- Let 'em read the screenplay.

382
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:44,715
Yes, sir!

383
00:28:46,657 --> 00:28:50,457
See, it starts here on page one.

384
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,519
<i>The Muppet Movie, huh?</i>

385
00:28:53,597 --> 00:28:57,465
Let's see.
"Exterior. Swamp. Day.

386
00:28:57,535 --> 00:29:01,403
In a long helicopter shot
we discover Kermit the Frog...

387
00:29:01,472 --> 00:29:03,440
playin' his banjo and singin'.

388
00:29:03,507 --> 00:29:06,499
A Hollywood agent starts
the frog traveling west.

389
00:29:06,577 --> 00:29:09,842
Doc Hopper comes on strong
and they get to this church.

390
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,712
Interior. Church. Day. Fozzie.

391
00:29:12,783 --> 00:29:15,752
They don't look like
Presbyterians to me.

392
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,846
Kermit and Fozzie come walkin'
down the aisle...

393
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,392
to the thunderously loud music...

394
00:29:22,459 --> 00:29:25,587
of Dr. Teeth
and the Electric Mayhem."

395
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:28,097
Which am us!
Yeah! Yeah!

396
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:33,330
This is a narrative of
very heavy-duty proportions.

397
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:38,467
Cosmic, man. We gotta keep this little
froggy away from this Hopper dude.

398
00:29:38,542 --> 00:29:40,601
Too true.
Too true.

399
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:44,774
It is indeed a problem for
us to "probosculate" upon.

400
00:29:44,848 --> 00:29:49,547
But it seems the frog and the bear
are temporarily out of service.

401
00:29:50,554 --> 00:29:53,546
Wow, like, what
can we do to help them?

402
00:29:53,624 --> 00:29:56,559
- Well, if this were the movies...
- Which it is.

403
00:29:56,627 --> 00:29:58,720
We'd think of
a clever plot device.

404
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:02,823
Like disguising their car
so they won't be recognized.

405
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,663
Right, two, three, four.

406
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:09,838

recognize you now.

I don't know how
to thank you guys.

448
00:32:35,786 --> 00:32:39,153
- I don't know why to thank you guys.
- Our pleasure, green stuff.

00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,316
Are you sure you won't come
with us to Hollywood?

450
00:32:41,391 --> 00:32:44,360
Can't, baby.
But when you get rich and famous...

451
00:32:44,428 --> 00:32:47,124
maybe we'll show up
and exploit your wealth.

452
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,298
Movin' right along, Fozzie.

453
00:32:52,369 --> 00:32:55,497
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

454

Hollywood! Hollywood!

455
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:08,350
Remember,
this frog does everything.

456
00:33:08,418 --> 00:33:10,909
He talks, he sings,
he dances, he tells jokes.

457
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:13,286
He even rides a bicycle.

458
00:33:13,357 --> 00:33:15,825
Max, find me a frog and a bear
in a tan Studebaker.

459
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:21,092
Gee, Doc, all I can see is a frog and
a bear in a rainbow-colored Studebaker.

460
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,895
- What?
- What?

461
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:27,334
- Fozzie, they're right behind us!
- I know! I know!

462
00:33:27,404 --> 00:33:29,964
- How did they recognize us?
- They recognized you.

463
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,974
- What do you mean?
- There's a hundred bears around.

464
00:33:32,042 --> 00:33:33,976
I'm gaining on 'em, Doc!

465
00:33:34,044 --> 00:33:36,740
- Can't you drive any faster?
- No, sir.

466
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:38,304
Pull in front of that sign.

467
00:33:38,382 --> 00:33:41,112
- Now duck.
- What?

468
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,278
- Get down, Fozzie.
- Yes, sir.

469
00:33:53,764 --> 00:33:58,360
Oh, yeah?

470
00:33:58,435 --> 00:34:00,369
Uh-huh, yeah.

471
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:07,509
I tell ya, Camilla.
Great plumbers are born, not made.

472
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:10,308
I'm a prince of the plunger,
fair maiden.

473
00:34:12,716 --> 00:34:16,618
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah. We'll do that.
Just wait till we get there.

474
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:19,155
Fozzie, look at that
funny little truck.

475
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,953
- Yeah. Cute, huh?
- No, it's coming straight at us.

476
00:34:25,262 --> 00:34:26,695
We're gonna hit!

477
00:34:28,532 --> 00:34:32,832
- We missed it.
- Oh? You call that a miss?

478
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,432
I'm getting in your car.

479
00:34:41,044 --> 00:34:45,037
- You guys okay?
- Why are you hopping up and down?

480
00:34:45,115 --> 00:34:48,516
- Because I'm hopping mad.
- Guy's got a sense of humor.

481
00:34:49,286 --> 00:34:52,312
- Hey, why don't you join us?
- Where are you going?

482
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:56,883
- We're following our dream.
- Really? I have a dream too.

483
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,428
- Oh?
- But you'll think it's stupid.

484
00:34:59,496 --> 00:35:01,430
- No, I won't.
- Tell us. Tell us.

485
00:35:01,498 --> 00:35:05,059
I wanna go to Bombay, India,
and become a movie star.

486
00:35:06,136 --> 00:35:08,764
You don't go to Bombay
to become a movie star.

487
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:10,898
You go where we're going...
Hollywood!

488
00:35:10,974 --> 00:35:15,104
Sure, if you wanna do it
the easy way.

489
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,942
We picked up a weirdo.

490
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,243
Hey, look up ahead.
There's Mad Man Mooney's.

491
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:24,651
- What's that?
- That's a used car lot.

492
00:35:24,721 --> 00:35:27,656
Maybe we can trade in both
these old cars and get one big one.

493
00:35:27,724 --> 00:35:30,716
- Wait, trade in my uncle's Studebaker?
- Sure.

494
00:35:30,794 --> 00:35:34,787
- When he wakes up, he'll kill me.
- You're swingin' this turn very wide.

495
00:35:34,865 --> 00:35:37,026
Hold it, will ya?
Here we go. Up the bump.

496
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,796
Okay, here we go. Hold on.

497
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,805
- Pull it up ahead there.
- Look at these cars!

498
00:35:42,873 --> 00:35:46,673
- Are you gonna sell my plunger too?
- No, he's not.

499
00:35:46,743 --> 00:35:49,371
Look at 'em up there.
Pull it up a little farther.

500
00:35:49,446 --> 00:35:51,937
Where shall I stop?
How should I stop?

501
00:35:52,015 --> 00:35:54,074
- A little bit farther.
- Okay. Here?

502
00:35:56,353 --> 00:35:58,480
- Everybody out of the car.
- Okay. Chickens first.

503
00:35:58,555 --> 00:36:03,185
My dear friends, welcome to
Mad Man Mooney's hubcap heaven.

504
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,785
Today is your lucky day.

505
00:36:05,862 --> 00:36:08,160
- It is?
- Yes, it is. You, for example.

506
00:36:08,231 --> 00:36:10,665
- You're drivin' the wrong car.
- I am?

507
00:36:10,734 --> 00:36:14,966
I can put you in this German
street machine for only $2,000.

508
00:36:15,038 --> 00:36:18,474
Less a $12 trade-in
on your old vehicle.

509
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:20,772
Now, this car is one
of the greatest...

510
00:36:24,681 --> 00:36:27,013
Detachable fenders
for narrow garages.

511
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:28,244
No, thanks.

512
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:31,412
What is this pile of...
Jack, get rid of this heap.

513
00:36:31,488 --> 00:36:33,547
Come out here!

514
00:36:33,623 --> 00:36:35,215
What?
What, what?

515
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:38,318
What's the matter with you?
That's myJack.

516
00:36:38,395 --> 00:36:42,331
- Hi, Jack.
- Jack not name. Jack job.

517
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,630
How many times have I told you
not to talk to the customers?

518
00:36:46,703 --> 00:36:50,036
- Yeah, I know...
- Just move this. You understand?

519
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:55,277
Wow!

520
00:37:03,253 --> 00:37:07,849
Friends, Mad Man Mooney doesn't believe
in all that dealing and wheeling.

521
00:37:07,924 --> 00:37:10,484
No, the price on the sticker
is the price you pay.

522
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,721
And never more and never less.

523
00:37:15,065 --> 00:37:17,693
We'll take that one for $11.95.

524
00:37:18,535 --> 00:37:21,732
- What?
- Less our $12 trade-in.

525
00:37:21,805 --> 00:37:23,796
You owe us a nickel.

526
00:37:27,844 --> 00:37:31,541
Thank you very much. Hey, we're
all going to Hollywood. Wanna come?

527
00:37:31,615 --> 00:37:36,075
- Hollywood!
- That's strange. He just ran away.

528
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,383
- Moving right along, Fozzie.
- Yes, sir.

529
00:37:44,461 --> 00:37:48,693
- Watch where you're going now, Fozzie.
- Yes, sir.

530
00:37:48,765 --> 00:37:51,996
Hey! Wait!
Where are ya goin'?

531
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:56,938
Hey! Wait for me!
I wanna go to Hollywood!

532
00:37:57,007 --> 00:37:58,941
Hey! Wait for me!

533
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:01,842
Come on, guys!
Wait, please!

534
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:04,244
I wanna go to Hollywood!

535
00:38:41,351 --> 00:38:44,514
Testing, one, two, three.
Testing. Can you hear me?

536
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:49,218
It's time to announce the winner of
this year's Bogen County Beauty Pageant.

537
00:38:51,294 --> 00:38:55,355
<i>- We sure grow 'em pretty around here.
- What's that?</i>

538
00:38:55,432 --> 00:38:57,366
<i>All right, here they are.</i>

539
00:38:57,434 --> 00:38:59,732
<i>- The first runner-up...
- What's over there?</i>

540
00:38:59,803 --> 00:39:03,261
<i>- Is Debbie Sue Anderson.
- See?</i>

541
00:39:07,844 --> 00:39:11,075
Nice-looking girls, huh?

542
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:13,514
- Wow! Nice-looking chickens.
- What?

543
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:16,814
<i>- No hard feelings, honey.
- Before announcing the winner...</i>

544
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:19,720
I think we should thank
the judges of today's contest...

545
00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:22,280
Edgar Bergen
and Charlie McCarthy.

546
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:29,089
You're not gonna believe
who the winner is, folks.

547
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:32,897
- Come now, Charlie. It's their movie.
- So 'tis.

548
00:39:36,506 --> 00:39:41,569
And here she is, folks,
this year's Miss Bogen County...

549
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:44,113
Miss Piggy!

550
00:39:48,818 --> 00:39:50,285
Thank you.

551
00:39:51,454 --> 00:39:54,617
Wow! It's a pig!
Did you see that?

552
00:39:54,691 --> 00:39:57,182
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you.

553
00:40:01,131 --> 00:40:03,156
Oh, Debbie Sue.

554
00:40:03,233 --> 00:40:07,294
Oh, Ama Jane.
Thank you. Thank you.

555
00:40:08,605 --> 00:40:09,867
Thank you.

556
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:13,700
Thank you.
Kissy-kissy.

557
00:40:13,777 --> 00:40:16,337
Kissy-kissy.
Thank you.

558
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:19,075
- Kermit, you know...
- Not right now, Fozzie.

559
00:40:19,149 --> 00:40:22,778
I just want to say one thing.

560
00:40:22,852 --> 00:40:26,652
This is the happiest
moment of my...

561
00:40:39,035 --> 00:40:42,766
<i>Never before</i>

562
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:46,070
<i>Have two souls joined so freely</i>

563
00:40:46,142 --> 00:40:49,578
<i>And so fast</i>

564
00:40:49,646 --> 00:40:55,141
<i>For me this is the first time
and the last</i>

565
00:40:55,218 --> 00:40:59,552
<i>Is this an angel's wish</i>

566
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,217
<i>For men</i>

567
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:05,386
<i>Never before</i>

568
00:41:05,462 --> 00:41:09,592
<i>And never again</i>

569
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:14,831
<i>And where to find the words
to sing its won'th</i>

570
00:41:16,306 --> 00:41:19,503
<i>This love was bound for Heaven</i>

571
00:41:19,576 --> 00:41:22,067
<i>Not for Earth</i>

572
00:41:22,145 --> 00:41:24,375
<i>This love was meant</i>

573
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:29,146
<i>To light the stars</i>

574
00:41:29,219 --> 00:41:31,153
<i>But when we touched</i>

575
00:41:31,221 --> 00:41:36,090
<i>We made it ours</i>

576
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:38,320
<i>And could they take it back</i>

577
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:41,956
<i>Oh, no, they wouldn't dare</i>

578
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:45,331
<i>Why should they take it back</i>

579
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:48,803
<i>When there's enough</i>

580
00:41:48,872 --> 00:41:52,171
<i>To share with all the world</i>

581
00:41:52,242 --> 00:41:57,043
<i>And fill the heavens above</i>

582
00:41:57,113 --> 00:41:59,411
<i>With leftover love</i>

583
00:41:59,482 --> 00:42:03,009
<i>Never before</i>

584
00:42:03,086 --> 00:42:06,146
<i>A love that keeps on growing</i>

585
00:42:06,222 --> 00:42:09,555
<i>On and on</i>

586
00:42:09,626 --> 00:42:12,220
<i>To fill each lover's heart</i>

587
00:42:12,295 --> 00:42:15,423
<i>And light the dawn</i>

588
00:42:15,498 --> 00:42:19,457
<i>Is this an angel's wish</i>

589
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:22,437
<i>For men</i>

590
00:42:22,505 --> 00:42:25,372
<i>Never before</i>

591
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:30,778
<i>And never again</i>

592
00:42:32,482 --> 00:42:38,114
<i>Never before</i>

593
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:44,093
<i>And never again</i>

594
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:07,945
Excuse me.

595
00:43:08,017 --> 00:43:10,747
- Yes. Of course.
- Listen.

596
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,584
Congratulations on winning
the beauty contest.

597
00:43:13,656 --> 00:43:18,787
Thank you. Of course, normally,
I don't do anything so trivial.

598
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:22,423
- I am an actress/model.
- Oh, is that right? Well, um...

599
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:24,797
I'm gonna be a performer too.

600
00:43:26,069 --> 00:43:29,004
Hey, Kermit,
who's the cute-lookin' pig?

601
00:43:29,072 --> 00:43:31,097
I beg your pardon.

602
00:43:31,174 --> 00:43:33,540
If you were a chicken,
you'd be impeccable.

603
00:43:34,611 --> 00:43:36,772
Hey, I thought we were
gonna go get some ice cream.

604
00:43:36,846 --> 00:43:39,178
In a minute.
I'll join you.

605
00:43:44,654 --> 00:43:47,646
Well, what are you doing in town...

606
00:43:47,724 --> 00:43:50,989
short, green and handsome?

607
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:55,190
- Well, we're headed west.
- Really?

608
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:58,757
Yeah, but I should join
my friends for ice cream.

609
00:44:00,203 --> 00:44:02,433
You want to come along?

610
00:44:02,505 --> 00:44:05,997
Me? You mean it?
I'll be right back.

611
00:44:06,075 --> 00:44:08,407
Don't move!

612
00:44:11,147 --> 00:44:11,347
Hello, I'd like an ice cream.

613
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:13,747
Hello, I'd like an ice cream.

614
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,752
What do you want?
Chocolate, vanilla, coffee, peach fudge?

615
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,253
- Rum banana?
- Honey.

616
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:22,758
Honey? I beg your pardon.
I hardly know ya.

617
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:26,557
But seriously, I'd like
a honey ice-cream cone for me...

618
00:44:26,629 --> 00:44:29,496
and a dragonfly ripple
for my friend, the frog.

619
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:33,935
Okay, one honey cone
for the bear.

620
00:44:34,003 --> 00:44:36,665
- One dragonfly ripple for the frog.
- Yucky.

621
00:44:36,739 --> 00:44:39,435
- Don't get 'em mixed up.
- Gotcha.

622
00:44:49,419 --> 00:44:51,444
All right, Camilla,
I'll get you a balloon.

623
00:44:51,521 --> 00:44:55,082
But you have to pick the color.
Red or green?

624
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:58,787
- Can I give you a word of advice?
- What?

625
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:02,263
Why not take both?

626
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,336
What a wild idea!

627
00:45:07,403 --> 00:45:10,236
Yeah, a beautiful chicken
like that deserves two balloons.

628
00:45:10,306 --> 00:45:12,638
You're right.
I have guys in all the time.

629
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:14,802
Sometimes they get a bunch
of balloons for their girls.

630
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:18,746
- They go gaga for it.
- Gaga? I'll take the whole bunch.

631
00:45:31,961 --> 00:45:34,054
I wonder where they went?

632
00:45:37,867 --> 00:45:39,787
- Where's your pig friend?
- I'm not really sure.

633
00:45:39,836 --> 00:45:41,997
She said she was coming
for ice cream, but...

634
00:45:42,071 --> 00:45:44,699
Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!
Here I am!

635
00:45:44,774 --> 00:45:47,334
Here I am! I'm packed!
I'm packed!

636
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:53,280
- Yeah, so I see. What for?
- You said I could come with you.

637
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:56,113
Yeah, but, to buy ice cream,
not to Hollywood.

638
00:45:56,185 --> 00:45:59,848
- We're going to Hollywood!
- No! I mean, listen.

639
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:03,415
When I said...
Well, when you heard...

640
00:46:03,493 --> 00:46:04,926
Oh, brother.

641
00:46:06,262 --> 00:46:07,695
What?

642
00:46:14,003 --> 00:46:17,598
- What are you doing?
- About seven knots.

643
00:46:20,109 --> 00:46:23,510
- We'll follow you. To the car!
- Yes, sir!

644
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,105
Gonzo, we're coming!

645
00:46:26,182 --> 00:46:28,776
- Step on it, Fozzie.
- Yes, sir.

646
00:46:28,851 --> 00:46:32,514
- Kermit, you're a born leader.
- Where is he?

647
00:46:34,023 --> 00:46:37,789
Isn't this great?
Here I am, floating in space.

648
00:46:38,661 --> 00:46:42,757
This is the place to be.
Whoopee!

649
00:46:42,832 --> 00:46:45,995
- Fozzie, bear left.
- What?

650
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:47,696
- Bear left.
- Right, frog.

651
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:49,795
- What? That's cute.
- Never mind.

652
00:46:51,207 --> 00:46:53,903
This is...
Look at our little car down there.

653
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,445
This is like flying.

654
00:46:57,513 --> 00:46:59,674
Maybe this is flying.

655
00:46:59,749 --> 00:47:02,513
I'm flying! Whoopee!

656
00:47:02,585 --> 00:47:04,815
Doc, isn't that a frog up there?

657
00:47:05,888 --> 00:47:08,118
No, that's a frog down here.

658
00:47:08,191 --> 00:47:10,659
He's caught in a crosswind, Fozzie.
We're gonna lose him.

659
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:11,989
Oh, no!

660
00:47:15,031 --> 00:47:18,296
- What are you doin', Doc?
- I'm goin' after their tires.

661
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:22,464
We're okay now. The wind shifted.
Wait a minute.

662
00:47:22,538 --> 00:47:25,974
Stay with him, Fozzie.
He's right above us.

663
00:47:28,211 --> 00:47:30,145
- He's okay.
- Yeah. Hi, Gonzo!

664
00:47:30,213 --> 00:47:33,671
- Fozzie, come back in here!
- What? Yes, sir.

665
00:47:34,884 --> 00:47:38,047
- Watch down the road!
- Kermit!

666
00:47:40,056 --> 00:47:42,991
Look out for the billboard!

667
00:47:48,631 --> 00:47:51,327
- Take off, Fozzie!
- Yes, sir!

668
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:54,336
Come back, you!

669
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:57,601
No frog's gonna make
a monkey outta me!

670
00:48:00,243 --> 00:48:04,577
- I'm back.
- I don't understand any of this.

671
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,611
I just gotta
catch up with those guys!

672
00:48:16,025 --> 00:48:20,428
Kermit. You were so courageous,
so magnificent.

673
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:23,255
Gee, I don't know what to say.

674
00:48:23,332 --> 00:48:26,597
Say the bear was magnificent.
After all, I did the driving.

675
00:48:26,669 --> 00:48:30,161
And I took a 100-foot belly flop
onto a moving car.

676
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:34,642
Yes, but, Kermit assumed
the awesome responsibility...

677
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,372
of command.

678
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:39,779
- Gee.
- Oh, brother.

679
00:48:41,517 --> 00:48:43,815
Why don't we stop
somewhere for the night...

680
00:48:43,886 --> 00:48:48,050
and have a quiet,
little dinner for two?

681
00:48:48,124 --> 00:48:51,116
Terrific!
I'll eat with you, Miss Piggy.

682
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:53,992
Not you, buzzard beak!

683
00:48:54,063 --> 00:48:55,997
<i>Just mon capitaine...</i>

684
00:48:56,065 --> 00:48:58,090
<i>and moi.</i>

685
00:48:59,168 --> 00:49:02,865
Well, that might be nice.

686
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:16,275
Wow.

687
00:49:17,453 --> 00:49:21,787
Good evening, Miss Piggy.
You look lovely tonight.

688
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:23,985
Thank you.

689
00:49:33,436 --> 00:49:36,963
I'm so sorry
if I kept you waiting.

690
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:39,064
It was won'th it.

691
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,133
<i>How charming of vous.</i>

692
00:49:49,385 --> 00:49:54,186
I took the liberty
of ordering us some wine.

693
00:49:56,459 --> 00:49:58,051
Oh, waiter.

694
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:02,620
Yes?
May I help you?

695
00:50:02,698 --> 00:50:04,962
The wine, please.

696
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:12,236
You mad, impetuous fink.
It's champagne.

697
00:50:12,308 --> 00:50:15,038
Not exactly.
Sparkling muscatel.

698
00:50:15,111 --> 00:50:19,207
One of the finest wines of Idaho.

699
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:23,878
- You may serve us now, please.
- May I?

700
00:50:24,954 --> 00:50:30,051
- Look how he does that.
- Yeah. Pretty suave.

701
00:50:40,236 --> 00:50:42,864
Don't you want to smell
the bottle cap?

702
00:50:47,343 --> 00:50:48,833
- Smells good.
- Yeah.

703
00:50:48,911 --> 00:50:50,572
Would you like
to taste it first?

704
00:50:50,646 --> 00:50:52,876
Well...

705
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:57,784
- I think he's supposed to.
- Would you taste it for us, please?

706
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:13,733
Excellent choice.

707
00:51:13,803 --> 00:51:15,896
Should be for 95 cents.

708
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:22,902
- And may we have straws, please?
- Yes.

709
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:25,971
I expected that.

710
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:30,243
Thank you.
That'll be all for now.

711
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:34,551
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

712
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:36,251
Thank you!

713
00:51:38,594 --> 00:51:40,892
Here's to you, Miss Piggy.

714
00:51:40,963 --> 00:51:42,555
Drink up.

715
00:52:01,484 --> 00:52:03,418
Makes me giggly.

716
00:52:05,187 --> 00:52:06,620
The wine?

717
00:52:07,857 --> 00:52:09,791
Everything.

718
00:52:13,896 --> 00:52:15,989
It's a beautiful evening,
isn't it?

719
00:52:16,999 --> 00:52:18,694
Uh-huh.

720
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:22,397
And the moon is just lovely.

721
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:29,735
But you know, Miss Piggy...

722
00:52:29,812 --> 00:52:31,905
the moon doesn't look like you.

723
00:52:40,656 --> 00:52:44,057
Miss Piggy! Miss Piggy!

724
00:52:44,126 --> 00:52:47,562
- Are you Miss Piggy?
- Yes?

725
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:49,188
Telephone.

726
00:52:55,237 --> 00:52:58,798
I did place one phone call
to my agent.

727
00:52:59,875 --> 00:53:03,038
It'll only be
an eensy-teensy moment.

728
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:09,651
What the hey.

729
00:53:30,039 --> 00:53:32,906
Evenin'.
Rowlf. Rowlf the Dog.

730
00:53:32,975 --> 00:53:35,205
Sit yourself down.

731
00:53:35,277 --> 00:53:37,905
- Kermit. Kermit the Frog.
- Pleased to meet ya.

732
00:53:42,651 --> 00:53:44,778
I'm no Heifetz, but I get by.

733
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:47,118
That was...
That was very nice.

734
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:51,091
Whoa, hey, broken heart, right?

735
00:53:52,094 --> 00:53:53,288
Does it show?

736
00:53:53,362 --> 00:53:57,765
Listen, when you've been ticklin'
the ivories as long as I have...

737
00:53:57,833 --> 00:54:00,859
you've seen a broken heart
for every drop of rain.

738
00:54:00,936 --> 00:54:03,803
A shattered dream
for every fallen star.

739
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:08,673
Exactly.
She just walked out on me.

740
00:54:08,744 --> 00:54:13,010
- Typical. That's why I live alone.
- You do, huh?

741
00:54:13,082 --> 00:54:14,947
You bet.

742
00:54:15,017 --> 00:54:17,884
I finish work,
I go home, read a book...

743
00:54:17,953 --> 00:54:21,548
have a couple of beers,
take myself for a walk and go to bed.

744
00:54:21,624 --> 00:54:23,592
Nice and simple.

745
00:54:23,659 --> 00:54:27,993
- Stay away from women. That's my motto.
- But I can't.

746
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:30,999
Neither can I.
That's my trouble.

747
00:54:32,868 --> 00:54:34,927
<i>You can't live with 'em</i>

748
00:54:35,004 --> 00:54:37,268
<i>You can't live without 'em</i>

749
00:54:37,339 --> 00:54:41,605
<i>There's something
irresistible-ish about 'em</i>

750
00:54:41,677 --> 00:54:45,204
<i>We grin and bear it
'cause the nights are long</i>

751
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:48,079
<i>I hope that somethin'better
comes along</i>

752
00:54:49,351 --> 00:54:51,342
I see what you mean.

753
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:55,220
<i>It's no good complainin'
and pointless to holler</i>

754
00:54:56,058 --> 00:54:59,323
<i>If she's a beauty
she'll get under your collar</i>

755
00:55:00,062 --> 00:55:03,088
<i>She made a monkey
out of old King Kong</i>

756
00:55:03,165 --> 00:55:06,430
<i>I hope that somethin'better
comes along</i>

757
00:55:09,138 --> 00:55:11,538
<i>Still, it's fun
when you're fetchin'</i>

758
00:55:11,607 --> 00:55:13,541
<i>And agree to see an etching</i>

759
00:55:13,609 --> 00:55:17,238
<i>That you keep at your lily pad</i>

760
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:21,249
<i>There is no solution
It's part of evolution</i>

761
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:23,251
<i>The pitter patter of soles</i>

762
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:25,412
<i>The little feet of tadpoles</i>

763
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:28,423
Rowlf, tadpoles don't have feet.

764
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:31,483
Sorry about that.
Two, three, four.

765
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:36,054
<i>There's no limitation
to mixin'and matchin'</i>

766
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:39,863
<i>Some get an itchin'for a critter
they've been scratchin'</i>

767
00:55:39,935 --> 00:55:43,427
<i>A skunk was badgered
The results were strong</i>

768
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,440
<i>I hope that something better</i>

769
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,499
<i>I hope that something better</i>

770
00:55:47,576 --> 00:55:53,481
<i>I hope that something better
comes along</i>

771
00:56:02,124 --> 00:56:04,092
Phone call for Kermit the Frog!

772
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,027
- You Kermit the Frog?
- Yeah.

773
00:56:07,096 --> 00:56:08,188
Phone.

774
00:56:13,669 --> 00:56:18,333
It's not that often you see a guy
that green have the blues that bad.

775
00:56:22,878 --> 00:56:24,812
Kermie, please!

776
00:56:26,582 --> 00:56:29,278
<i>- Piggy, is that you?
- Yes, that's her.</i>

777
00:56:29,351 --> 00:56:33,549
<i>And this is Doc Hopper.
Now you listen, frog, and listen good.</i>

778
00:56:33,622 --> 00:56:38,491
Step outside the motel right now.
My guys'll meet you there.

779
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:42,187
Well, what if I don't?

780
00:56:42,264 --> 00:56:45,597
Then your girlfriend
will be ham hocks by breakfast.

781
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:49,137
Kermie, don't, don't!

782
00:57:06,155 --> 00:57:08,214
Are you the guys
I'm supposed to meet?

783
00:57:11,093 --> 00:57:13,960
Good, Glen. That's good.
Nice and tight.

784
00:57:16,398 --> 00:57:20,164
- The professor's here, Doc.
- Show him in. Show him in.

785
00:57:21,437 --> 00:57:25,237
Kermie, I'm not a bit worried.

786
00:57:25,307 --> 00:57:29,641
I know you're planning
something bold and clever.

787
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:32,476
Well, I got us
this far, didn't I?

788
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:39,585
- How are you?
- Professor Krassman.

789
00:57:39,655 --> 00:57:42,886
It's good to see you, Doc,
you little rustic devil, you.

790
00:57:42,958 --> 00:57:46,621
Where's my victim?
I mean, patient.

791
00:57:46,695 --> 00:57:48,629
- Step this way, Professor.
- Of course.

792
00:57:48,697 --> 00:57:51,757
Let me introduce you
to your patient.

793
00:57:51,834 --> 00:57:54,098
Prof. Krassman is
the world's leading authority...

794
00:57:54,169 --> 00:57:56,569
on mind control in frogs.

795
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:01,269
It's a very rapidly growing field.
You like garlic, don't you?

796
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:04,244
Tell us what you're gonna do
to our little Kermit.

797
00:58:04,313 --> 00:58:09,273
Well, we're going to perform
an electronic "cerebrectomy."

798
00:58:09,351 --> 00:58:12,616
- A what?
- An electronic cerebrectomy!

799
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:16,858
What's that?

800
00:58:16,925 --> 00:58:20,588
It's something so sensational
that you'll have to hold on to your hat.

801
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:22,824
- Yes?
- When a German scientist says...

802
00:58:22,898 --> 00:58:25,059
"Hold on to your hat,"
it's not casual conversation.

803
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:27,694
Hold on to your hat!
Hat, hold! Good!

804
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:31,137
Now, what we're going to do is bring out
a machine that's going to wow you.

805
00:58:31,206 --> 00:58:33,970
Bertram, Bertram,
bring out the machine!

806
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:36,409
Wait till you see this. You think
we're sleeping in Dusseldorf?

807
00:58:36,478 --> 00:58:39,709
You think we're taking a nap
in Cologne? No, we're working at night.

808
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:43,149
Each night, a new dial,
a new knob, a diode.

809
00:58:43,218 --> 00:58:46,483
- Electronic ce...
- Cerebrectomy.

810
00:58:46,555 --> 00:58:49,991
- Electronic cerebrectomy.
- What does it do?

811
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:52,152
What does it do?

812
00:58:52,227 --> 00:58:54,991
It turns the brains into guacamole.

813
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:00,635
First of all,
I'll pull out of this, okay?

814
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,637
Wonderful.

815
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,799
Second?

816
00:59:09,478 --> 00:59:11,844
Halt!

817
00:59:11,914 --> 00:59:14,508
I detest the surfeit
of provincial laughter.

818
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:18,280
Now, we take your friend,
the little "F-O-R-G"...

819
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:21,118
put him in the chair,
clamp on the terminals...

820
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,385
drop the electronic yarmulke...

821
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:26,394
and throw, what we call
in German, the switch.

822
00:59:29,431 --> 00:59:31,524
Yes, you little green devil...

823
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:35,730
soon it'll be a hot time
at the old skull tonight.

824
00:59:35,804 --> 00:59:39,103
Thank you, Herr Machine.
Now, the frog will do your bidding.

825
00:59:39,174 --> 00:59:42,837
He will do your every whim, He will do
your television commercial, yes.

826
00:59:42,911 --> 00:59:47,007
He will sell your frogs' legs.

827
00:59:47,082 --> 00:59:49,414
- Zaparooni.
- Head full of jelly.

828
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:53,683
- A noggin full of library paste!
- Let's fry them brains!

829
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,850
- You've got a fun job.
- I love it, I love it.

830
00:59:56,925 --> 01:00:00,725
If I could inflict a little pain during
the afternoon, I sleep good at night.

831
01:00:00,796 --> 01:00:03,264
- We'll let you get on with it, then.
- My pleasure.

832
01:00:03,332 --> 01:00:05,562
Max.

833
01:00:05,634 --> 01:00:09,900
I'll be back later
to pick up what's left of the frog.

834
01:00:09,972 --> 01:00:13,635
"What's left of the frog." You can have
everything, excuse the brain.

835
01:00:13,709 --> 01:00:16,234
All right.
Bring over the frog.

836
01:00:18,013 --> 01:00:20,675
Kermie, whatever happens next...

837
01:00:20,749 --> 01:00:24,446
I wouldn't give up
this evening together for anything.

838
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,455
- Would you?
- Make me an offer.

839
01:00:33,195 --> 01:00:35,720
Okay, I got him.
I got him.

840
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:38,266
Good, good.

841
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:40,824
And why don't we take
a little seat, Kermit?

842
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:43,394
Hold his hands down.

843
01:00:43,472 --> 01:00:46,464
Get your feeties in place.

844
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:48,840
Will you stop whimpering?

845
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:51,539
Go out like a frog,
not a little toad.

846
01:00:51,613 --> 01:00:56,277
Okay, Herr Machine, this is
big time here. Ready to go to work?

847
01:00:56,351 --> 01:00:58,546
Hand clamps!

848
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:00,485
Foot clamps!

849
01:01:02,758 --> 01:01:05,420
You can struggle
all you want now, frog.

850
01:01:05,494 --> 01:01:08,861
It'll do you very little good.

851
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:12,025
All right. And now
it's time to drop...

852
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,034
the electronic beanie.

853
01:01:15,771 --> 01:01:19,229
Soon there'll be enough voltage coursing
through your little frog brain...

854
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:22,175
to light up Cincinnati.

855
01:01:22,244 --> 01:01:25,839
- Here we go.
- Oh, please! Not my frog, please!

856
01:01:25,914 --> 01:01:30,044
- Say good-bye to the frog, pig.
- Why should I?

857
01:01:30,118 --> 01:01:35,181
Because in ten seconds,
he won't know you from kosher bacon.

858
01:01:35,257 --> 01:01:37,191
That does it!

859
01:02:02,451 --> 01:02:04,385
What the heck's goin' on here?

860
01:02:04,453 --> 01:02:07,513
A pig that goes bananas?
What is this, a luau?

861
01:02:07,589 --> 01:02:09,557
Where'd she go?

862
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:11,650
Oh, boys.

863
01:02:11,727 --> 01:02:13,718
There she is! Get her!

864
01:02:15,364 --> 01:02:18,333
I must reach the switch.
I must!

865
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,391
- Switch... I must reach...
- Oh, no.

866
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:29,944
- Now, Kermie.
- Thank you.

867
01:02:41,523 --> 01:02:43,491
Well...

868
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:45,527
shall we go now, Kermie?

869
01:02:47,963 --> 01:02:51,592
Well...
Just a second.

870
01:02:56,872 --> 01:02:59,466
What?
Piggy, it's your agent.

871
01:03:01,643 --> 01:03:03,577
Thank you.

872
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:07,407
Yeah, Morty.
What have you got?

873
01:03:07,482 --> 01:03:08,779
Commercial?

874
01:03:10,352 --> 01:03:14,288
How much? When?

875
01:03:14,356 --> 01:03:16,483
Take it.

876
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:27,001
Good-bye!

877
01:03:45,687 --> 01:03:47,177
What happened?

878
01:03:49,691 --> 01:03:51,989
Flip, flip, flip, flip.

879
01:03:55,964 --> 01:03:58,455
Don't worry, Animal.
Your big scene is coming up.

880
01:03:58,533 --> 01:04:02,128
Yeah, yeah. Just be cool and
eat another seat cushion.

881
01:04:02,204 --> 01:04:04,138
Seat cushion!

882
01:04:07,776 --> 01:04:09,744
Well, how do you like the film?

883
01:04:09,811 --> 01:04:13,907
I've seen detergents that
leave a better film than this.

884
01:04:13,982 --> 01:04:18,180
I don't care what anybody else says.
I'm having a great time.

885
01:04:18,253 --> 01:04:20,084
Oh, good.

886
01:04:21,289 --> 01:04:24,986
- The "flim" is okey-dokey.
- Good. Roll film.

887
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:27,051
"Flim" is "rooling."

888
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:29,097
Quiet, quiet.

889
01:04:31,633 --> 01:04:33,965
This is the patriotic part.

890
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:36,869
- Should we stand up?
- No.

891
01:04:38,306 --> 01:04:42,572
<i>Oh, beautiful for spacious skies</i>

892
01:04:42,644 --> 01:04:46,740
<i>For amber waves of grain</i>

893
01:04:46,815 --> 01:04:51,081
<i>For purple mountains'majesties</i>

894
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:55,556
<i>Above the fruited plain</i>

895
01:04:55,624 --> 01:04:59,924
<i>America, America</i>

896
01:04:59,995 --> 01:05:04,364
<i>God shed His grace on thee</i>

897
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:08,870
<i>And crown thy good
with brotherhood</i>

898
01:05:08,937 --> 01:05:11,337
<i>From sea to</i>

899
01:05:11,406 --> 01:05:14,967
<i>Shining sea</i>

900
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:21,743
Patriotism swells in the heart
of the American bear.

901
01:05:36,598 --> 01:05:38,828
Hold it, boys. Hold it!

902
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,834
Hold your fire!

903
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:45,737
Now, boys, no reflection
on the job you been doin'...

904
01:05:45,807 --> 01:05:48,241
but I decided
to bring in a specialist.

905
01:05:59,087 --> 01:06:02,022
Now, boys, this is Snake Walker.

906
01:06:03,091 --> 01:06:05,286
Tell 'em what you do, Snake.

907
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:09,154
Kill frogs.

908
01:06:16,071 --> 01:06:19,302
- How long is it to Hollywood?
- We gotta be there by tomorrow.

909
01:06:19,374 --> 01:06:22,309
Hey, Kermit! Are you going to
get an agent like that pig had?

910
01:06:22,377 --> 01:06:25,107
Gonzo, you know
he's touchy about that.

911
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:28,841
- Hey, who's that? I don't believe that.
- Oh, no.

912
01:06:33,321 --> 01:06:35,687
- That's Piggy.
- Yeah, I know.

913
01:06:36,591 --> 01:06:38,582
Do you think we should
help her with her bag?

914
01:06:44,099 --> 01:06:47,330
Oh, Kermie!
What an unbelievable coincidence!

915
01:06:51,706 --> 01:06:53,970
Hello again.
It's me!

916
01:06:54,042 --> 01:06:56,306
Would you hold my laundry case?

917
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:01,845
- Well.
- Well what?

918
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:04,477
So much has happened to me
since I saw you last.

919
01:07:06,555 --> 01:07:09,149
Frankly, Miss Piggy,
I don't give a hoot.

920
01:07:09,224 --> 01:07:13,593
My name is Rowlf the Dog, and I was
playin' the piano in a... Oh, never mind.

921
01:07:19,401 --> 01:07:21,335
I missed you.

922
01:07:23,738 --> 01:07:26,798
Don't I get
one kissy-kissy?

923
01:07:26,875 --> 01:07:30,208
I don't think so, Miss Piggy.

924
01:07:30,278 --> 01:07:32,678
Just one little hug?

925
01:07:39,888 --> 01:07:42,379
<i>You've been listening
to music to hug frogs by...</i>

926
01:07:42,457 --> 01:07:44,948
<i>and this is Doc Hopper sayin'
that if Kermit the Frog...</i>

927
01:07:45,026 --> 01:07:47,153
don't stop right now and call me...

928
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:51,188
and agree to be my national spokesman,
he will soon be a frogburger.

929
01:07:54,669 --> 01:07:58,366
<i>- We'll be okay.
- Oh, mon capitaine.</i>

930
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:07,705
Oh, boy. Yeah.
What? No problem!

931
01:08:07,782 --> 01:08:11,548
It's okay, it's okay.
No problem. Hey, all right!

932
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:17,282
We're in trouble.

933
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,919
I wish I still had
my Studebaker.

934
01:08:19,995 --> 01:08:22,463
There's probably somethin'
broken about the engine.

935
01:08:22,530 --> 01:08:25,363
Hey, don't worry.
Someone's bound to come along.

936
01:08:25,433 --> 01:08:26,866
Yeah?

937
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:48,787
Well, I guess we blew it,
huh, Gonzo?

938
01:08:48,857 --> 01:08:50,791
Yeah.

939
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:55,487
But the sky sure is
beautiful out here.

940
01:08:55,563 --> 01:08:57,497
Look at that.

941
01:08:59,801 --> 01:09:04,738
We're gonna miss
the auditions tomorrow, right?

942
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:19,216
Boy, you could get lost
in a sky like that.

943
01:09:20,855 --> 01:09:23,847
I wish I had
those balloons again.

944
01:09:23,925 --> 01:09:27,122
So much for Hollywood.

945
01:09:27,963 --> 01:09:31,592
Listen, gang.
I never promised we'd make it.

946
01:09:31,666 --> 01:09:34,567
I never promised anything.

947
01:09:43,044 --> 01:09:46,172
<i>This looks familiar</i>

948
01:09:47,248 --> 01:09:50,547
<i>Vaguely familiar</i>

949
01:09:50,618 --> 01:09:55,180
<i>Almost unreal, yet</i>

950
01:09:55,256 --> 01:09:59,625
<i>It's too soon to feel yet</i>

951
01:09:59,694 --> 01:10:02,857
<i>Close to my soul</i>

952
01:10:02,931 --> 01:10:07,561
<i>And yet so far away</i>

953
01:10:07,635 --> 01:10:13,096
<i>I'm going to go
back there someday</i>

954
01:10:15,944 --> 01:10:20,608
<i>Sun rises, night falls</i>

955
01:10:20,682 --> 01:10:24,846
<i>Sometimes the sky calls</i>

956
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:28,650
<i>Is that a song there</i>

957
01:10:28,723 --> 01:10:31,988
<i>And do I belong there</i>

958
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:36,588
<i>I've never been there</i>

959
01:10:36,664 --> 01:10:39,633
<i>But I know the way</i>

960
01:10:40,702 --> 01:10:44,468
<i>I'm going to go back there</i>

961
01:10:44,539 --> 01:10:46,666
<i>Someday</i>

962
01:10:48,443 --> 01:10:52,607
<i>Come and go with me</i>

963
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:55,649
<i>It's more fun to share</i>

964
01:10:56,384 --> 01:11:00,377
<i>We'll both be completely</i>

965
01:11:00,455 --> 01:11:03,822
<i>At home in midair</i>

966
01:11:03,892 --> 01:11:08,158
<i>We're flyin', not walking</i>

967
01:11:08,229 --> 01:11:11,630
<i>On featherless wings</i>

968
01:11:11,699 --> 01:11:15,601
<i>We can hold on to young</i>

969
01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:19,333
<i>Like invisible string</i>

970
01:11:24,646 --> 01:11:28,707
<i>There's not a word yet</i>

971
01:11:28,783 --> 01:11:33,311
<i>For old friends who've just met</i>

972
01:11:33,388 --> 01:11:37,347
<i>Part heaven, part space</i>

973
01:11:37,425 --> 01:11:41,987
<i>Or have I found my place</i>

974
01:11:42,063 --> 01:11:45,555
<i>You can just visit</i>

975
01:11:45,633 --> 01:11:49,501
<i>But I plan to stay</i>

976
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:54,872
<i>I'm going to go back there</i>

977
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:57,878
<i>Someday</i>

978
01:12:00,548 --> 01:12:05,383
<i>I'm going to go back there</i>

979
01:12:05,453 --> 01:12:07,921
<i>Someday</i>

980
01:12:42,924 --> 01:12:45,324
I didn't promise anybody anything.

981
01:12:46,828 --> 01:12:49,763
What do I know
about Hollywood anyway?

982
01:12:49,831 --> 01:12:53,699
Just the dreams I got from sitting
through too many double features.

983
01:12:53,768 --> 01:12:56,669
<i>So why did you leave the swamp
in the first place?</i>

984
01:12:56,738 --> 01:12:59,901
'Cause some agent fella
said I had talent.

985
01:12:59,974 --> 01:13:01,965
He probably says that
to everybody.

986
01:13:02,043 --> 01:13:04,568
<i>On the other hand,
if you hadn't left the swamp...</i>

987
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:07,274
<i>you'd be feeling
pretty miserable anyhow.</i>

988
01:13:07,348 --> 01:13:11,682
Yeah, but then it would
just be me feelin' miserable.

989
01:13:11,753 --> 01:13:14,847
Now I got a lady pig
and a bear and a chicken...

990
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:18,017
a dog, a thing...
whatever Gonzo is.

991
01:13:18,092 --> 01:13:21,892
- He's a little like a turkey.
- Yeah, A little like a turkey.

992
01:13:21,963 --> 01:13:24,363
- But not much.
- No, I guess not.

993
01:13:24,432 --> 01:13:27,026
Anyhow, I brought 'em all out here
into the middle of nowhere.

994
01:13:27,101 --> 01:13:29,069
It's all my fault.

995
01:13:29,137 --> 01:13:31,571
Still...

996
01:13:31,639 --> 01:13:33,630
whether you promised them
something or not...

997
01:13:33,708 --> 01:13:37,371
you gotta remember
they wanted to come.

998
01:13:37,445 --> 01:13:39,879
But that's because
they believed in me.

999
01:13:39,948 --> 01:13:42,473
No, they believed in the dream.

1000
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:45,713
- Well, so do I, but...
- You do?

1001
01:13:45,787 --> 01:13:49,314
- Yeah. Of course I do.
- Well, then?

1002
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:51,790
Well, then...

1003
01:13:51,859 --> 01:13:54,726
I guess I was wrong
when I said I never promised anyone.

1004
01:13:55,897 --> 01:13:57,865
I promised me.

1005
01:14:07,642 --> 01:14:09,576
Hey, now, wait a minute.

1006
01:14:24,125 --> 01:14:26,059
Hey, what's happening?

1007
01:14:26,127 --> 01:14:28,925
At the moment,
we're what's happening.

1008
01:14:30,798 --> 01:14:33,392
Oh, great!
Wonderful! Yeah!

1009
01:14:33,468 --> 01:14:35,902
Zoot! Hey, Zoot!

1010
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:39,303
Hold it, hold it.
Animal, cool it back there.

1011
01:14:39,374 --> 01:14:41,808
Yeah.

1012
01:14:41,876 --> 01:14:44,572
All right, yeah.

1013
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:47,979
Hey, it's wonderful to see you,
but how did you ever find us?

1014
01:14:48,049 --> 01:14:51,143
Oh, easy. We just read
the screenplay you left us.

1015
01:14:51,219 --> 01:14:54,655
"Exterior desert, night."
We knew right where you were.

1016
01:14:54,722 --> 01:14:56,747
Like, can you get behind it?

1017
01:14:56,824 --> 01:14:59,384
Hey, when you dudes
have to be at that audition?

1018
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:02,486
- 2:00 tomorrow afternoon.
- Well, climb aboard the bus.

1019
01:15:02,563 --> 01:15:04,997
We'll have breakfast
at Hollywood and Vine.

1020
01:15:11,939 --> 01:15:14,373
<i>Movin'right along</i>

1021
01:15:14,442 --> 01:15:16,740
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1022
01:15:16,811 --> 01:15:18,676
Here we go.

1023
01:15:20,915 --> 01:15:22,906
<i>Movin'right along</i>

1024
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:36,927
Kermie, whisper sweet nothings
into my ear.

1025
01:15:36,998 --> 01:15:39,432
Motorcycle cop.

1026
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,627
"Motorcycle cop"
is a sweet nothing?

1027
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:44,137
A motorcycle cop is chasing us.

1028
01:15:46,007 --> 01:15:47,941
Hey, Dr. Teeth,
you better pull over.

1029
01:15:48,009 --> 01:15:51,843
Hey, easier done than said.

1030
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:57,282
- Drag city.
- What do we do now?

1031
01:15:58,519 --> 01:16:00,885
Oh, dear.

1032
01:16:00,955 --> 01:16:03,890
Hey, hey. The man with the badge.
The police.

1033
01:16:03,958 --> 01:16:06,654
The cops, the fuzz, the P-l...

1034
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:10,357
- Don't you dare.
- I wouldn't think of it.

1035
01:16:15,036 --> 01:16:17,368
Did we do something
wrong, Officer?

1036
01:16:19,607 --> 01:16:22,371
- Kermie, it's him!
- Okay, gang. Let him explain.

1037
01:16:22,443 --> 01:16:25,469
This whole disguise is
only so I could warn you.

1038
01:16:25,546 --> 01:16:27,571
Yeah. Sure, sure.

1039
01:16:27,648 --> 01:16:31,812
I never thought Doc would hurt Kermit.
I thought he was gonna lean on him.

1040
01:16:31,886 --> 01:16:34,753
But now he's got this
frog killer in from the coast...

1041
01:16:34,822 --> 01:16:36,756
and the man is deadly!

1042
01:16:36,824 --> 01:16:38,849
Oh, no. Kermit,
what are we gonna do?

1043
01:16:38,926 --> 01:16:41,724
It's time to beat feet,
green stuff.

1044
01:16:41,796 --> 01:16:44,492
I love it. Chase music is
one of our best riffs.

1045
01:16:44,565 --> 01:16:47,033
Hold it, Dr. Teeth.
What's up ahead?

1046
01:16:47,101 --> 01:16:50,298
- Only an old ghost town.
- Fine.

1047
01:16:50,371 --> 01:16:53,670
Listen, you go tell Doc Hopper
I'll be waiting for him there.

1048
01:16:53,741 --> 01:16:56,904
- What?
- Kermit, you'll get killed!

1049
01:16:56,978 --> 01:16:59,913
Listen, guys. Listen.

1050
01:16:59,981 --> 01:17:02,609
I can't spend my whole life
running away from a bully.

1051
01:17:02,683 --> 01:17:05,117
It's time for a showdown.

1052
01:17:21,402 --> 01:17:23,495
Chugga, chugga.

1053
01:17:34,715 --> 01:17:37,275
Hey, listen.
I'm gonna check things out.

1054
01:17:37,351 --> 01:17:39,785
Everybody stay on the bus, okay?

1055
01:17:43,491 --> 01:17:45,152
- Hey, Kermit?
- Yeah?

1056
01:17:45,226 --> 01:17:48,627
Can I take Animal for a walk?
He needs some exercise.

1057
01:17:48,696 --> 01:17:50,630
Yeah, sure.

1058
01:18:08,049 --> 01:18:10,108
What is that?

1059
01:18:10,184 --> 01:18:14,746
That's one of my latest inventions...
a musical rotating rain barrel.

1060
01:18:14,822 --> 01:18:17,290
- Oh, yeah.
- You see...

1061
01:18:17,358 --> 01:18:21,852
I'm Dr. Bunsen Honeydew,
and this is my assistant, Beaker.

1062
01:18:21,929 --> 01:18:24,557
We live here,
perfecting useful inventions.

1063
01:18:24,632 --> 01:18:26,623
Come in, come in.

1064
01:18:31,372 --> 01:18:33,340
Welcome to our laboratory.

1065
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:38,235
Please don't touch anything.

1066
01:18:42,016 --> 01:18:44,712
Is this the only street into town?

1067
01:18:44,785 --> 01:18:46,719
Yes, yes.

1068
01:18:47,522 --> 01:18:49,717
Hey, what are you dudes
doin' in here?

1069
01:18:49,790 --> 01:18:51,917
I'm so glad you asked!

1070
01:18:51,993 --> 01:18:54,393
We're perfecting
our latest invention...

1071
01:18:54,462 --> 01:18:57,192
insta-grow pills.

1072
01:18:57,265 --> 01:19:00,860
Well, what in the name
of Fats Waller is that?

1073
01:19:02,169 --> 01:19:04,933
A four-foot prune!

1074
01:19:05,006 --> 01:19:07,304
A four-foot prune.

1075
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:11,038
Yeah, man. Well, what else
do these pills make big?

1076
01:19:11,112 --> 01:19:13,080
They work on anything.

1077
01:19:13,147 --> 01:19:15,445
But the effect is,
sadly, temporary.

1078
01:19:15,516 --> 01:19:17,279
Sadly temporary.

1079
01:19:27,528 --> 01:19:29,462
Hey, Kermit!
Here comes Doc Hopper!

1080
01:19:29,530 --> 01:19:32,124
I know.
I'll be ready for him.

1081
01:19:37,338 --> 01:19:40,739
Okay, frog. Where are ya?

1082
01:19:42,076 --> 01:19:44,135
I'm here. I'll meet you
in the middle of the street.

1083
01:19:44,211 --> 01:19:48,238
- Oh, yeah?
- Man to frog.

1084
01:20:07,835 --> 01:20:11,532
- All right, Hopper.
- All right, frog.

1085
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:14,734
One last chance.

1086
01:20:14,809 --> 01:20:18,267
You can do my TV commercials
live or stuffed.

1087
01:20:21,315 --> 01:20:23,249
What's the matter with you?

1088
01:20:23,317 --> 01:20:25,683
You gotta be crazy chasin' me
halfway across the country.

1089
01:20:25,753 --> 01:20:27,687
Why are you doin' this to me?

1090
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:32,787
'Cause all my life I wanted to own
a thousand frog-leg restaurants...

1091
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:34,794
and you're the key, greenie.

1092
01:20:34,862 --> 01:20:37,057
Yeah, well,
I've got a dream too.

1093
01:20:37,131 --> 01:20:40,658
But it's about singing and
dancing and making people happy.

1094
01:20:40,735 --> 01:20:44,330
The kind of dream that gets better
the more people you share it with.

1095
01:20:44,405 --> 01:20:52,005
And, well, I've found a whole bunch
of friends who have the same dream.

1096
01:20:52,079 --> 01:20:55,105
And it kind of
makes us like a family.

1097
01:20:55,182 --> 01:20:57,047
You have anybody
like that, Hopper?

1098
01:20:57,118 --> 01:21:00,315
Once you get all those restaurants,
who're you gonna share it with?

1099
01:21:00,388 --> 01:21:04,722
Who are your friends, Doc?
Those guys?

1100
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:11,391
I got lots of friends.

1101
01:21:13,234 --> 01:21:15,168
Max, for instance.

1102
01:21:18,339 --> 01:21:21,240
- Max.
- I don't think you're a bad man, Doc.

1103
01:21:21,308 --> 01:21:23,538
I think if you look
in your heart...

1104
01:21:23,611 --> 01:21:26,341
you'll find you really want
to let me and my friends go...

1105
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:28,541
to follow our dream.

1106
01:21:28,616 --> 01:21:32,177
But if that's not
the kind of man you are...

1107
01:21:32,253 --> 01:21:35,586
and if what I'm saying
doesn't make any sense to you...

1108
01:21:35,656 --> 01:21:39,456
well, then,
go ahead and kill me.

1109
01:21:52,707 --> 01:21:54,641
All right, boys.

1110
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:55,971
Kill him.

1111
01:21:57,978 --> 01:21:59,104
No, wait, please!

1112
01:22:51,665 --> 01:22:55,658
- Everybody goin' to Hollywood?
- Yeah!

1113
01:23:07,448 --> 01:23:09,643
Next stop is Hollywood and Vine.

1114
01:23:17,658 --> 01:23:21,059
Look at the ocean!
The ocean!

1115
01:23:23,964 --> 01:23:27,263
Yes, Mr. Lord. I'll have those
deal memos for you in a jiffy.

1116
01:23:33,607 --> 01:23:35,097
I'm sorry.

1117
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:38,907
Mr. Lord can't be disturbed by anyone.
He's packaging a blockbuster.

1118
01:23:42,983 --> 01:23:45,884
Look! It's wonderful!
Like a dream come true.

1119
01:23:45,953 --> 01:23:49,719
Don't count your tadpoles until they're
hatched. I still have to audition.

1120
01:23:49,790 --> 01:23:52,315
Hey, ain't nothin' to it
but to do it.

1121
01:23:55,462 --> 01:23:58,329
And where do you think
you're going?

1122
01:23:58,399 --> 01:24:02,062
Hi, there!
I'm going to audition for Lew Lord.

1123
01:24:02,136 --> 01:24:05,071
You can't just walk in here
off the street, you know.

1124
01:24:05,139 --> 01:24:07,232
Especially not with
all these animals.

1125
01:24:07,308 --> 01:24:09,401
Animals?
What's wrong with animals?

1126
01:24:12,947 --> 01:24:16,110
This is a movie studio,
not a zoo!

1127
01:24:16,183 --> 01:24:18,048
Besides...

1128
01:24:20,387 --> 01:24:24,118
I'm allergic to animal hair.
Now, get along, all of you.

1129
01:24:24,191 --> 01:24:26,523
Now, wait a second.
See here, miss.

1130
01:24:26,594 --> 01:24:30,052
I may not be one of your fancy
Hollywood frogs, but I deserve a chance.

1131
01:24:30,130 --> 01:24:33,691
We're going to stay here until you let
us in to see Lew Lord, aren't we, gang?

1132
01:24:33,767 --> 01:24:35,860
Yes! Yes!

1133
01:24:35,936 --> 01:24:38,928
- Yeah, come on!
- We're gonna sit right down and wait.

1134
01:24:39,006 --> 01:24:42,772
Yes, Security? Miss Tracy.

1135
01:24:42,843 --> 01:24:45,004
I want to report a...

1136
01:24:45,079 --> 01:24:47,513
Shake! Shake, everyone!

1137
01:24:47,581 --> 01:24:50,175
- That's it!
- Look what it's doing!

1138
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:52,776
- Go get 'em, man!
- Way to go!

1139
01:24:52,853 --> 01:24:55,287
Allergies are nothing
to sneeze at.

1140
01:24:55,356 --> 01:24:57,517
I'm allergic to cats, myself.

1141
01:25:07,935 --> 01:25:10,403
Okay, way to go, guys!

1142
01:25:10,471 --> 01:25:12,405
Thanks, miss.

1143
01:25:15,309 --> 01:25:17,243
Well, friends...

1144
01:25:17,311 --> 01:25:19,836
this is it.

1145
01:25:36,230 --> 01:25:40,166
Mr. Lord? Forgive the interruption,
but I'm here to audition.

1146
01:25:40,234 --> 01:25:41,997
Yes, yes.

1147
01:25:42,069 --> 01:25:45,835
We've come over 2,000 miles just...

1148
01:25:47,308 --> 01:25:48,570
Oh, boy.

1149
01:25:52,279 --> 01:25:55,043
We're all with you.

1150
01:25:57,518 --> 01:26:00,851
Please, sir, my name is Kermit the Frog,
and we read your ad...

1151
01:26:00,921 --> 01:26:04,084
and, well, we've come
to be rich and famous.

1152
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:22,404
Miss Tracy...

1153
01:26:22,476 --> 01:26:25,843
prepare the standard
"Rich and Famous" contract...

1154
01:26:25,913 --> 01:26:28,541
for Kermit the Frog and company.

1155
01:26:45,966 --> 01:26:48,696
Just look at all this.

1156
01:26:49,770 --> 01:26:51,829
How did a frog
make the big time?

1157
01:27:02,216 --> 01:27:04,411
It starts when we're kids.

1158
01:27:05,486 --> 01:27:08,353
<i>A show-off at school</i>

1159
01:27:08,422 --> 01:27:11,323
<i>Makin'faces at friends</i>

1160
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:13,326
<i>You're a clown and a fool</i>

1161
01:27:14,928 --> 01:27:18,489
<i>Doin'pratfalls and birdcalls
and bad imitations</i>

1162
01:27:18,565 --> 01:27:21,762
<i>Ignoring your homework
There's that dedication</i>

1163
01:27:21,835 --> 01:27:24,303
<i>Working the mirror</i>

1164
01:27:24,371 --> 01:27:27,397
<i>You're getting standing ovations</i>

1165
01:27:28,475 --> 01:27:30,568
<i>You're burning with hope</i>

1166
01:27:31,645 --> 01:27:34,580
<i>You're building up steam</i>

<i>You've found a home
at the magic store</i>

1172
01:27:53,267 --> 01:27:55,827
All right, everybody,
production number, okay?

1173
01:27:55,903 --> 01:27:58,701
Off the trucks and on the job!

1174
01:27:58,772 --> 01:28:01,263
- On the job!
- Hey, whoa! Aw, geez...

1175
01:28:01,341 --> 01:28:03,809
Wow, let's do it!

1176
01:28:03,877 --> 01:28:05,902
- Do what?
- The movie!

1177
01:28:05,979 --> 01:28:09,073
- Yes, sir! A footstomper!
- Makeup!

1178
01:28:09,149 --> 01:28:13,142
- Yes! Let's do it!
- Fozzie, take those wagons out of there.

1179
01:28:14,221 --> 01:28:16,382
Yes, sir. I'm off.

1180
01:28:22,529 --> 01:28:24,759
Scenery over there. Great.

1181
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:26,891
Moving right along. Hey!

1182
01:28:28,635 --> 01:28:31,126
Hey, those are
the trees for the swamp.

1183
01:28:31,205 --> 01:28:33,639
Mellow and profitable.

1184
01:28:36,810 --> 01:28:39,711
- Let's make the scene!
- Okay, hon.

1185
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:43,409
- Watch the tree, Rowlf.
- Careful, Scooter.

1186
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:48,421
Watch it!

1187
01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:50,889
Miss Piggy, you look beautiful.

1188
01:28:50,958 --> 01:28:53,324
- Thank you!
- Hollywood talk.

1189
01:28:56,864 --> 01:28:57,864
Good.

1190
01:28:57,898 --> 01:29:00,196
The lights... Yeah.

1191
01:29:00,267 --> 01:29:02,735
Good. Save those arcs.

1192

Crazy Harry plays

Sound is ready.
Give me a level.

Okay, everybody.
Stay in focus, huh?

1197

Okay, stand by.
Here we go!
