2
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,170
Good morning, Mr Blake.
My name's Amanda.

3
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,420
I've got a couple of questions
here for you today

4
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,060
to establish your eligibility for
Employment Support Allowance.

5
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,420
It won't take up much of your time.

6
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,220
Could I just ask firstly,

7
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,930
can you walk more than 50 metres
unassisted by any other person?

8
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,780
- Yes.
- Okay.

9
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,940
Can you raise either arm as if to
put something in your top pocket?

10
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,940
I've filled this in already
on your 52-page form.

11
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,500
Yeah, I can see that you have

12
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,980
but, unfortunately, I couldn't
make out what you had said there.

13
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,460
Yes.

14
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,970
Can you raise either arm
to the top of your head

15
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,980
as if you are putting on a hat?

16
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,360
I've telt you, there's nowt wrong
with me arms and legs.

17
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,400
Could you just answer
the question, please.

18
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,800
Well, you've got me
medical records.

19
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,380
Can we just talk about me heart?

20
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,420
D'you think you could
just answer these questions?

21
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,980
Okay.

22
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,380
So was that a yes, that you
can put a hat on your head?

23
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,220
- Yes.
- Okay, that's great.

24
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,900
Can you press a button
such as a telephone keypad?

25
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,680
There's nowt wrong
with me fingers either.

26
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,140
I mean, we're getting farther
and farther away from me heart.

27
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,060
If we could just keep
to these questions, thank you.

28
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,340
Do you have any significant difficulty

29
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,030
conveying a simple message to strangers?

30
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:56,020
Yes. Yes, it's me fucking heart.
I'm trying to tell you but you'll not listen.

31
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,820
Mr Blake, if you continue
to speak to us like that

32
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,740
that's not gonna be very helpful
for your assessment.

33
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,330
If you could just answer
the question, please.

34
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,140
- Yes.
- Okay.

35
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:17,020
Do you ever experience any loss of control
leading to extensive evacuation of the bowel?

36
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,020
No. But I cannot guarantee

37
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,190
there won't be a first if we divvent
get to the point.

38
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,060
Can you complete a simple
task of setting an alarm clock?

39
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,340
Oh, Jesus. Yes.

40
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,260
Can I ask you a question?
Are you medically qualified?

41
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,820
I'm a health care professional

42
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,330
appointed by the
Department of Work and Pensions

43
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,060
to carry out assessments for
Employment and Support Allowance.

44
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,260
But there was a bloke out in the,
er, in the waiting room,

45
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,620
he says that you work
for an American company.

46
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,260
Our company's been
appointed by the Government.

47
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,500
Are you a nurse?
Are you a doctor?

48
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,380
I'm a health care professional.

49
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,940
Listen, I've had a major heart attack.

50
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,900
I nearly fell off the scaffolding.

51
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,700
I wanna get back to work, too.

52
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,810
Now, please, can we talk about me heart?

53
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,540
Forget about me arse, that works a dream.

54
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,460
Piper, you lazy bastard.

55
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,620
Will you get out of bed
and do some housework!

56
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,890
China!

57
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,150
China!

58
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,140
Sorry, Dan, just got a text
to go to work. I'm late.

59
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,260
Did you enjoy your
chicken tikka masala?

60
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,440
- How did you know that?
- Cos I can bloody smell it.

61
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,200
How many times have I told you about
leaving rubbish lying about the place,

62
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,290
stinking it up?

63
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,060
- Can I dump it later? I'm running late.
- No. Now!

64
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,980
Dan...

65
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,420
Erm, I've got a big favour to ask

66
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,450
I'm expecting a package. Really important.

67
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,560
They've changed my hours, so I won't be in.

68
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,190
Can you keep an eye out for the postman?

69
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,380
If you swear nae more rubbish.

70
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,500
- Catch!
- Don't you fucking dare.

71
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,180
- I'll kick your arse into next week.
- Okay.

72
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,180
Daft as a bloody brush.

73
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,340
When can I go back to work?

74
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,620
Ah, not yet, that's for certain.

75
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,220
You're making progress.

76
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,780
I think if we just
continue you on the same dosage.

77
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,220
And, yeah, rehab exercise.

78
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,220
We'll see if we can
the pumping capacity to increase.

79
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,620
- Yeah.
- And it might.

80
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,620
But if not, we might need to look
at fitting you with a defibrillator.

81
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,020
Keep up with the exercise, keep moving.
That's gonna build you up.

82
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,860
But you need to be rested as well.

83
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,980
Well, I'm a bit of a night owl, you know.

84
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,220
I got into the habit
when I was looking after the missus

85
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,620
before she passed away.

86
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,940
How you doing, son? How you doing?

87
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,020
- All right.
- How's the old ticker?

88
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,780
Ah, you know, me marathon days are over.

89
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,020
But, you know,
I'll be fine in a month or two.

90
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,140
Ah, well, be leaving that Viagra alone.

91
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,250
I'll keep it for you, shall I?

92
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,730
Aye, I probably need it more than you.

93
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,700
Right, well, owt you want here?

94
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,940
- Have a look
- Oh, that's nice, aye.

95
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,260
Meranti, aye, African Meranti.
It's great, man.

96
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,270
So, er, d'you reckon
you'll get back to Ferguson's?

97
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,280
Depends on the work, I suppose.

98
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,380
I mean, you know what it's like.
It's up and down.

99
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,540
Aye, well.

100
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,940
Gotta see this.

101
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,860
There you go.

102
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,940
Oh, that's a lovely piece.

103
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,340
Aye, I'll have the...
I'll have the lads drop it by for you.

104
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,380
Erm, are you all right?

105
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,460
I'm on the mend.

106
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,100
I mean, I can get your shopping
sorted out for you, you know.

107
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,280
Like, the heavy stuff and that,
like, it's nae bother.

108
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,020
Thanks, Joe.
You know, I like to get out and about.

109
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,290
Gives us something to do.

110
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,870
Well, give us a shout if you need anything.

111
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,740
I mean, I mean that.

112
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,300
You, you gave us a big fright, you know.

113

Morning, mate.
Got a package for Mr Max Million.

143
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,700
- "Mr Max Million"?
- Yeah. Mr Max Million.

144
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,020
My address?

145
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,770
Yeah, definitely this address.

146
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,580
- Where's it from?
- China.

147
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,620
Oh. Give it here.

148
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,540
D'you know how long
I've been on this phone?

149
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,100
One hour, forty-eight minutes.

150
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,380
Jesus Christ, that's longer than
a football match. It'll cost a fortune.

151
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,150
I'm sorry, sir,
but it's been very busy.

152
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,530
There must be some mistake.

153
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,460
I've got a serious heart condition.

154
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,180
I'm in rehab and the doctor's
told us I cannae go back to work.

155
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,620
Now, I was getting the benefits
fine until that bloody assessment.

156
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,120
I see you've only
scored twelve points, er,

157
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,860
and you need 15 to obtain benefits.

158
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,060
Oh, points, that's your game?

159
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm sorry, sir,
but according to our health, er,

160
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,580
health care professional,

161
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,020
you've been deemed fit for work.

162
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,980
So she knows better than my doctor,

163
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,770
a consultant surgeon and a physio team?

164
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,580
Well, I wanna appeal.

165
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,040
Well, that's fine,

166
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,470
but you'll have to first request
a mandatory reconsideration.

167
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,860
What the bloody hell does that mean?

168
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,640
It means the decision
maker will reconsider it

169
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,620
and if he comes to the same
decision, you can then appeal.

170
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,830
Right, well put us down for that, then.

171
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,960
Okay, sir, but you must wait

172
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,580
to get a call from the decision maker.

173
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,260
Why?

174
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,110
To tell you what the decision is.

175
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,460
But that's already been decided.

176
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,900
It is, but you're supposed to get the call,

177
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,460
before the letter.

178
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,260
Well, is he gonna change his mind?

179
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,030
No, the call's
just to discuss the decision.

180
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,840
Well, I know what the decision is,
I've got the letter here in front of us.

181
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,620
D'you want us to read it to you?

182
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,840
But he should have called you first.

183
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,140
But he didn't.

184
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,240
But he should have.

185
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,600
Well unless we've got a time machine,
we're pretty much knackered,

186
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,980
divvent you agree?

187
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,640
Er, he has to call you first, sir.

188
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,300
Listen,

189
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:12,620
can you not just put him on now,
so I don't have to waste any more time?

190
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,710
I can't do that, sir.

191
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,420
Where is he?

192
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,440
He'll give you a call back when he, er,

193
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,620
- he gets the chance.
- When?

194
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,940
I don't know, sir.

195
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,050
This is ridiculous, man.

196
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,410
On the one hand, Jobseeker's Allowance,

197
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,420
only for those able and ready to work.

198
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:53,020
But if you're ill, you have to apply
for Employment and Support,

199
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,150
get an assessment carried out.

200
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,380
Well, I've done that
but they've knocked us back.

201
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,520
Right, well if you've
been deemed fit for work,

202
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,660
your only option is Jobseeker's Allowance.

203
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,870
Or proceed with the appeal on
Employment and Support.

204
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,180
Well, can you give me a form for...

205
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,750
You know, erm, Jobseeker's Allowance

206
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,250
and then an appeal form
Employment and Support?

207
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,780
You have to apply online, sir.

208
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,980
I cannot do that.

209
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,550
Well that's how it is, sir.
Or you can phone the helpline.

210
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,700
Listen, you know,
you give me a plot of land,

211
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,020
I can build you a house.

212
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,700
But I've never been
anywhere near a computer.

213
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,700
D'you know what, we're digital by default.

214
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,980
Oh, here we gan.

215
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,700
I hear this all the time on the phone,
"I'm digital by default."

216
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,540
Well I'm pencil by default.

217
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,420
Look, I mean, what happens
if you just cannae do it?

218
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,900
There's a special number
if you've been diagnosed as dyslexic.

219
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,580
Right, well can you give us that?
Cos with computers I'm dyslexic.

220
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,740
You'll find it online, sir.
I must ask you to leave now,

221
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,420
if you've got no appointment.

222
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,190
Right, can I help you?

223
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:55,460
Yeah, I'm here to see about
changing my work coach.

224
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,900
Thomas Armstrong, please.

225
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,740
Hang on a minute, Thomas, hang on.

226
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,250
Erm, would you like to take a seat?

227
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,820
Oh, I just need a minute. I just felt...
I'm just feeling dizzy, you know.

228
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,740
- Come and sit down.
- Oh, cheers, thanks.

229
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,260
Could you move up, please, love?

230
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,020
Thanks, pet, thank you.

231
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,540
- All right. I'll just get you a glass of water.
- Thank you.

232
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,650
Oh, thank you, pet.
Thank you.

233
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,580
Are you all right?
You look a bit pale.

234
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,780
It's just so bloody confusing,
all the jargon.

235
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,390
I mean, there must be some mistake.
I'm just ganning round and round in circles.

236
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,240
I've, I've really gotta
get this sorted out.

237
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,760
Oh I can understand that,
but you were late.

238
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,460
Thomas. You sit here
and drink your water, pet.

239
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,780
Thank you.

240
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,280
So now you're gonna sanction me so, er...

241
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,770
- No, I'm not gonna sanction you.
- I may not get any money for a month.

242
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,360
I'm gonna refer you to the decision maker
and they'll make the decision

243
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,360
- on whether they're gonna sanction you.
- That's ridiculous...

244
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,480
I'm not actually making the decision,
they're gonna do that.

245
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,580
And then if they do decide
to sanction you,

246
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,820
then you will take a 40%
cut in your benefits.

247
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,960
I know what it is,
I don't need you to explain it to me.

248
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,800
- I'm more than aware...
- Well there isn't anything else

249
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,810
anybody can do today.

250
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,400
So what I'm gonna have to do is,
look, I think I'm...

251
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,200
I've decided to...
Are you gonna put me in for a sanction?

252
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,360
I have to, I have to follow the rules.

253
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,960
And the thing is if you're gonna,
be aggressive with me

254
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,640
- then I'm gonna have to ask you...
- It's not about me being aggressive.

255
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:20,520
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
- I'm trying to explain to you a situation

256
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,580
and you don't care.

257
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,640
- Er, security. Security?
- I don't know why people like you do this job.

258
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,810
I'm referring you
to the decision maker.

259
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,740
It's all the same thing.
I don't wanna hear your language

260
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,720
- I, I beg your pardon.
- Listen, I, I'm sorry, love,

261
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,480
- but you're gonna have to leave.
- Yeah, all right, frankly,

262
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,080
take your hands off me.
I'm gonna speak to the manager,

263
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,720
- I don't wanna speak to you.
- The fact is I'm just trying to explain...

264
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,880
- Sorry?
- I'm just explaining...

265
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,080
Well it's not you I wanna speak to...

266
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,920
- You can go back up there.
- Right, come and talk to me then

267
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,720
- if you've got something to say.
- Okay. Sorry.

268
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,860
All right.

269
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,480
I've tried to explain to the woman,
I've never been to Newcastle before.

270
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,860
We've just moved up here from London.

271
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,280
I've been here a few days,
I don't know where I'm going. Okay?

272
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,860
I was on the bus, it's gone the wrong way.

273
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:54,430
We've run, got off the bus,
run so that I wasn't any more late.

274
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,140
She just don't wanna know

275
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,400
and now she's telling me
she's gonna refer me for a sanction.

276
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,100
What I want you to
do is listen to me. Okay?

277
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,780
The lady's told you what's right.

278
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,330
There's rules here,
rules that we have to stick to. Okay?

279
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,920
- It isn't against you, but you have a duty.
- Oh, mate, listen,

280
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,780
- I'm not saying it's against me.
- You have a duty to be here on time.

281
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,850
And I'm explaining to you

282
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,340
why I wasn't here on time.

283
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,820
- D'you know what? I understand, right...
- I got lost.

284
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,140
But what I gather now
is the decision maker...

285
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,840
The decision maker's gonna be
sending you a letter through the post.

286
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,850
So you're gonna have to wait for that.

287
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,960
- And then nobody...
- Yeah, I've got... My kids

288
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,680
have gotta start school tomorrow.
I've got about 12 quid in my purse.

289
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,880
- D'you know what?
- All because you can't just calm down

290
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:28,890
- and listen to people when they talk.
- Right.

291
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,040
- You have to do this.
- Right, d'you know what,

292
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,240
- I've listened to you. You've created a scene.
- With your rules.

293
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,440
- I think you need to...
- I've created a scene?

294
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,680
- You need to leave the building.
- If I was gonna create a scene,

295
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,800
you'd know about it, trust me.

296
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,890
I'm sorry, love,
but you are gonna have to go.

297
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:38,910
This is ridiculous.

298
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,480
- Jesus Christ!
- What am I supposed to do?

299
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,080
- Who's first in this queue?
- I am.

300
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,620
D'you mind if this young
lass signs on first?

301
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,700
- No, no, you carry on.
- There you go.

302
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,460
Now you can go back to your
desk and let her sign on

303
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,820
and do the job that the
taxpayer pays you for.

304
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,420
- This is a bloody disgrace.
- Listen, all right,

305
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,900
this doesn't have to involve you.

306
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,180
Everybody's trying to do their job here
and you're creating more of a scene again.

307
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,600
But, look, you're not listening to her.

308
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,190
She's out of the area.
She's just been a few minutes...

309
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,870
Can you not let her sign on?
She's got two kids with her, man.

310
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,920
- What's wrong with you people?
- Right, listen, this isn't your concern.

311
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,400
I want you to get out as well. All right?

312
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,730
I need you to leave.
We need to do this right. Yeah.

313
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,400
- All right.
- Listen, listen, listen...

314
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,000
- They're just gonna call the police.
- Phone the police.

315
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,620
Can we get some perspective in here?

316
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,600
You need to go or we're gonna
phone the police. All right?

317
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,820
Come on. Thanks very much...

318
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,600
Can we have a bit of perspective,
please, here, man?

319
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,080
- Away, don't be silly.
- Shouldn't even have this job.

320
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,440
- Come on. Please.
- Shouldn't even have this job.

321
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,160
- Come on, get out.
- All she needs is help, man.

322
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,830
- Let's get going.
- Just let her sign on.

323
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,180
Let's get going, all right.

324
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,610
Please.

325
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,920
I don't know what's wrong
with you lot, I really don't.

326
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,820
I need you to keep going for me, okay?

327
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:44,190
- You want me to take one of them bags?
- No, it's all right, I'm fine, pet. I'm fine.

328
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,980
- Where's Dylan?
- I don't know.

329
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,540
Dylan! Come on!

330
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,760
- Honestly. Honestly.
- He's a handful, isn't he?

331
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,240
I can't sit down for five minutes
without him getting in trouble, can I?

332
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,380
Right.

333
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,670
- Good, good choice.
- She loves spaghetti.

334
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,320
Hey, you cannae go wrong
with spaghetti on toast.

335
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,590
Spaghetti, spaghetti on toast, isn't it?

336
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,890
Where's your brother gone?

337
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,740
- Dylan!
- Dylan!

338
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,460
Come on.

339
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,540
This, this is what he does.
He runs, he runs off.

340
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,110
- He's a handful, in't he?
- Come on!

341
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,660
Where ye been, on an adventure?

342
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,900
Dylan, not on the fences.

343
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,800
- It's just here.
- Mum, look, she's back, she's back.

344
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,180
She's back.

345
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,020
Tell you what, if it's the last thing I do,
I'm gonna make this place a home.

346
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,030
You don't know how to
fix a cistern, do you?

347
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,700
It's driving me insane.

348
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,510
- Yeah, I'll have a look at that.
- Yeah?

349
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,020
I can fix owt, me, pet,

350
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,020
apart from computers.

351
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,630
- Straight up. You show him...
- I'll show him.

352
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,050
Dylan, can you stop it? Get in.

353
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,740
Hello, Mum. How are you doing?

354
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:11,940
Yeah.

355
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,260
Yeah, all right. All right. Yeah.

356
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,050
It's nice, it's nice.
There's plenty of space.

357
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,080
And, erm, yeah, it looks like they've put...
There's a nice bit of fresh carpet down.

358
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,780
The, the walls are all
nicely painted and that.

359
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:31,660
No, I know, Mum. Well, look, once...
Once you're feeling better and we're settled,

360
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,990
then you'll have to come up. You can come
up with Auntie May and stay, can't you?

361
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,470
Yeah, they're nice, yeah, friendly.
Friendlier than London.

362
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,260
Yeah.

363
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,470
D'you wanna have a word with Daisy?

364
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,380
All right, hold on. Talk to Nana.

365
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,020
Hello, Nan.

366
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,340
- Hello, Daisy. How are you?
- Good.

367
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,100
- Yeah? D'you like it?
- Yeah.

368
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,300
- Are you happy?
- Yeah, very.

369
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,340
I miss you, too. Bye.

370
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,100
Bye-bye.

371
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,110
Hello, Mum.

372
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,220
All right. That's all right.
All right, I'll speak... Yeah, I've gotta go

373
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,980
but I'll speak, I'll call you tomorrow.

374
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,880
- All right.
- All right, love you.

375
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,500
- Love you, too. Bye.
- Bye, bye, bye.

376
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,470
So what are you doing up here, Katie?

377
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,600
It started when we got
kicked out of the flat.

378
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,900
We got in a bit of trouble.

379
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,130
It was ridiculous.

380
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,790
In Dylan's room there was a leak
coming through the wall,

381
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,950
coming through the top of the ceiling
down the wall.

382
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,760
And it was making him really sick.
Weren't it, Dais?

383
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,360
- Remember when Dylan weren't well?
- Yeah.

384
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,500
We had to run all the way to the hospital.

385
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,140
Yeah, he was in and out the hospital.

386
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,120
I was talking to the landlord about it,
spoke to him.

387
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,140
And cos I complained, kicked us out.

388
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,430
What, they can just do that?

389
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,150
- Just throw you out?
- Yeah, yeah.

390
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,940
So we got out of there.

391
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,820
We was in a homeless hostel
for about two years, waiting on a flat.

392
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:56,820
Yeah. But it was close to their school
which they loved, so...

393
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,820
We just had to stick it out.
But we was in one room,

394
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,130
the three of us were in one room.

395
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,310
Like eating, sleeping, all the rest of it
and Dylan was just climbing the walls.

396
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:09,050
Honestly,
like boxed in like that, so, yeah.

397
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:13,700
They eventually offered me a flat,
so the good news was it was a flat.

398
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,460
Bad news was it was up here.

399
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,000
And they couldn't give you
anywhere near your family?

400
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,170
No, not in London.

401
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:23,180
They're, they're moving out the likes of me.
It's just too expensive for 'em.

402
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,170
So how's the kids taking it?

403
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,180
They're brokenhearted about leaving school.

404
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,780
Especially Daisy. She's furious with me.

405
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,260
Having to leave her friends and her nan.

406
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,870
I mean there was nothing I could do about it.
I couldn't have Dylan boxed in like that.

407
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,910
- Ah, she'll make friends soon enough.
- That's what I've told her.

408
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,580
And I've got a plan.

409
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,640
We got a little garden now and they've
each got a room of their own.

410
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,390
I'm gonna get a part-time job
and then I'm gonna go back to me books.

411
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,250
- Oh, you at college?
- Open University.

412
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:57,220
Yeah, I mucked up a little bit at school
so it's like a second chance.

413
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,880
But that all fell apart a little bit when
we was at the hostel,

414
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:02,060
but I'm not gonna give up.

415
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,860
Can't, can I?

416
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,460
Good on you, lass.

417
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,140
It's bloody freezing in here.

418
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,900
Oh, it must be a short.

419
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,820
Right, where's your fuse box?

420
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,540
There's nothing on the metre.

421
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,700
The kids are starting school and
I wanted to get 'em some nice new clothes.

422
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,790
And I thought I was gonna
get me money tomorrow.

423
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,460
Right.

424
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:29,420
I'll bring me tools round
and I'll sort this place out for you.

425
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,820
- Will ya?
- Yeah, course I will.

426
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,700
Shouldn't take long.

427
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,260
Right, thank you.

428
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,580
"Max Million", to my fucking address?

429
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:48,220
- China, what's in this box?
- Dan, it's not what you think it is.

430
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,700
Don't jump to conclusions.

431
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,340
Shift that bloody rubbish
and shift your arse.

432
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,180
I wanna see what's in this box.

433
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,970
Oh my God. Wow.

434
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,490
- What d'you think of these?
- Bloody trainers?

435
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,260
- Trainers.
- Trainers.

436
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,340
- These are only the best, Dan.
- Very best.

437
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,020
Aren't they, Piper?

438
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,290
Aren't they?

439
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,740
Stop it, man, I've got brittle bones.

440
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,780
Anyways, I've got a test for you, Dan.

441
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,540
- Go on, open it.
- Open that.

442
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,140
What's the difference?

443
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,310
Yeah. What's the difference
between them two?

444
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,530
They look the same.

445
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,540
- Bang on, brother.
- Exactly.

446
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:45,540
The difference is, they'd have cost me
150 quid on the high street...

447
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,580
And I'm gonna sell those for 80 quid.

448
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:51,380
Cheap counterfeits
to my fucking address?

449
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,460
I could have the Chinese Mafia
or the bloody Customs at me door.

450
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,580
The brass neck of the bloody pair of you.

451
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,580
Dan, these are not counterfeits.

452
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,980
They're from the same factory as these.

453
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:05,420
Exactly the same quality.
Continuation of the same run.

454
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,370
- D'you not believe us?
- It's fucking genius.

455
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,500
How d'you manage this?

456
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:12,340
Well I know a guy from Guangzhou, don't I,
who works in the factory.

457
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,980
Yeah, works in the factory.

458
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,340
He's football mad.

459
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,100
He knows everything
about the teams, the players, everything.

460
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:21,020
So we do the deals by e-mails.
I send him the money by PayPal,

461
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,300
then he sends me the package by post.

462
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,460
Me, you mean.

463
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:29,100
Honestly, Dan, I did mean to say,
like I get them sent to different mates.

464
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:32,420
You know, small packages
like not to attract too much attention.

465
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,060
They usually get through.

466
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,470
I'll be able to tell all me mates
I knew both of you

467
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,140
before you were arrested.

468
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,740
See these trainers, Dan,

469
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,260
these are the future.

470
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,860
No more crap jobs.

471
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,220
No more shit from that warehouse.

472
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,190
D'you know what the bastards
did this morning?

473
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,460
Got us in at 5:30.

474
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:56,170
Unloaded one truck.
Guess how long that took?

475
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:59,030
Forty-five minutes.
And you know how much I got paid?

476
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,460
Three pound and seventy-nine pence.

477
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:04,660
Waste of my fucking time.
It's worse than China.

478
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,460
I'm gonna make it big
one day, Dan. I'm serious.

479
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,820
Hi there, can I help you?
You look a bit lost.

480
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,980
Aye. I have to apply
for Jobseeker's Allowance...

481
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,490
- Right, yeah. Mmm-hmm.
- And I wanna use one of them

482
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,970
to get on to that Internet web thing.

483
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,420
Right, you could do that today.

484
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,490
We're a bit busy at the moment.

485
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,590
If you can come back a bit later,
would that be okay?

486
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,650
- And then contact Job Centre Plus.
- Mmm-hmm.

487
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,820
And, here we are. "Claim Jobseeker's".

488
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,840
- Okay? So double-click on that one.
- Okay. All right.

489
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:52,060
And then we need to scroll
right the way down here to continue.

490
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,620
And that's your,
that's your form there for you.

491
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,580
So you need to run the mouse up the screen,

492
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,500
click into there and pop your postcode in.

493
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,820
- Run the mouse up the screen, yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.

494
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,590
- No. No, not quite like that.
- No?

495
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:10,580
- What you need to do is get your cursor...
- "Your cursor"?

496
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,180
It's a fucking apt name for it.

497
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,180
So when you're moving your mouse,

498
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,560
- you see what I'm doing with my hand?
- Aye, right.

499
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,100
- Look at my hand.
- Aye. Oh, right, it moves like that.

500
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,580
- And then continue.
- Right, okay.

501
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,620
- And then you start from there. Okay?
- Okay.

502
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,900
- I'll leave you with it. Okay?
- Right.

503
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:31,980
Right.

504
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,660
Excuse me, pet.
You couldn't help us with this, could you?

505
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,620
Yeah. What is it?

506
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,580
I'm just filling this in.
I'm just... I cannot get the...

507
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,540
This keeps darting all over the place.

508
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:54,580
What do I do?
Do I get on to that and...

509
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,440
Do you just...
I mean, how do you get this down?

510
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:59,980
Right, so you're controlling this,
and you click on this bar.

511
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,620
- Right.
- And then you pull it down.

512
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,950
- Oh, right.
- And then you get...

513
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,640
- What, do I hold that on there, do I? Okay.
- The rest of it. Yeah.

514
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,840
- All right, then I can just...
- On the left side.

515
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,640
What, what, so I hold this
and just pull that down?

516
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,310
- Yeah, and click the left.
- And click...

517
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,660
- Click to the left.
- Yeah. Right.

518
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:15,780
And I just put that in there?
Oh, that's right, thanks very much.

519
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,460
- It's fine.
- Aye.

520
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:20,900
You're a star. Right.

521
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:25,220
Right, have I done it right?
There we are...

522
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,660
Oh, bloody hell. What's this now?

523
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,650
"Error"?

524
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,660
Well, what have I...

525
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,480
Here, mate, you divvent know
what I've done here, do you?

526
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,620
- This error thing.
- Yeah, that's a big thing.

527
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:45,700
Do you? I don't know, I was just
filling in the thing and it just went...

528
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,680
- There we go.
- Oh, oh, yeah, there we go.

529
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,740
We're back on, right.

530
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,200
- You're sorted, yeah?
- Hey, can you just hang on

531
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:53,100
just for two seconds so I divvent
go back here again. I'll...

532
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,680
Just, just, just, I'll just like do
a couple more questions.

533
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,470
Yeah, I'll just stand over here,
don't worry.

534
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,220
Er...
"Are you a Br..."

535
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:02,460
- Yeah.
- "Yes". Right. I do that.

536
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,740
- Right. What?
- Yeah.

537
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,160
- What's...
- Then you should continue.

538
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,460
Should be all right.

539
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,700
Right, okay.

540
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,700
What's...

541
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,420
It's, it's, it's not bloody, it's not...

542
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,280
- Well nowt's happening now.
- Yeah, just give it a second.

543
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,660
Just give it a second.

544
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,150
But it's just not mov... I mean, look,
it's not even, it's not even moving.

545
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:21,180
- Let me try, right.
- What? Here, get that.

546
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:24,740
This is driving me mental, this.
I mean, what have I done now?

547
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,380
- It's frozen. Yeah.
- It's frozen?

548
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,340
Well... Well, can you defrost it?

549
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,970
No, mate, I can't.

550
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,700
Think your time's up.

551
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,980
- What?
- Your time's up.

552
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,420
- Me time's up?
- Yeah, I'm sorry, mate.

553
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,730
Oh, sorry, mate, yeah.

554
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,940
- I'll just leave you to it.
- Oh jeez.

555
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:44,020
- Do you have a partner?
- Er, no. She, er, she's passed away.

556
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:46,420
- Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that.
- Thank you.

557
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,900
D'you have any dependent children
aged under 20 living with you?

558
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,060
No, I don't.

559
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:56,260
It's really important we get this filled in
because we need to get the process started.

560
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,820
Yeah.

561
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:03,860
Excuse me, Ann. Can I have a word, please?

562
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,440
Could you just give me 30 seconds, please?
We're just getting...

563
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,440
Well, actually,
can I have a word now, in my office?

564
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,500
Thank you.

565
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:12,660
- Right.
- Jesus, I've got you into trouble now.

566
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,540
- I'm really sorry.
- It's me that should be sorry.

567
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,420
You just carry on, you're doing good.

568
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,060
You know, Ann, we've spoke
about this before.

569
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,460
That isn't acceptable.

570
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,960
- I think in this case it's quite reasonable...
- Come on in the office.

571
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,820
The thing is you're setting a precedent.

572
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,100
It's not acceptable.

573
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,620
Oh, bugger. Bugger, it's...

574
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,010
Jesus...

575
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,420
I don't believe this.

576
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,040
No, I only want my share of the football.

577
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:54,540
Right then, that's the only team you
need to know in the northeast, is Newcastle.

578
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:55,860
What other teams do you know?

579
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:58,860
- Er, Middle... Middle-borough.
- Middlesbrough, aye.

580
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:59,880
- Middlesbrough. Yeah.
- Middlesbrough.

581
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:02,980
You know, you divvent need to think
about them either. Aye?

582
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,900
There you go.

583
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:10,780
Er, we only have one Wagon Wheel left,
so I cut it into four.

584
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,900
But you can have two pieces
considering you're the host.

585
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:15,290
Oh, there you go.
I'll put your tea down there.

586
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:18,110
- Oh, hang on.
- Barclay's Premier League.

587
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,100
Here's the big question, Stan Li.

588
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:21,910
Did you say "Stan Li"?

589
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:24,060
Yeah. Stan Li from Guangzhou.

590
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,900
Are you two winding me up?

591
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,340
No, that's not our style.

592
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,300
Can you hear me, Stan Li?

593
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,020
Favourite player in the Premier?

594
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:35,380
Charlie Adams, Stoke City.

595
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,460
Get the fuck out of here.

596
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,900
Are, are you taking the piss?

597
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:43,860
EPL is crazy money, man.

598
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:47,140
Charlie Adam. Four million.

599
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,700
No ego.

600
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:49,980
Team player.

601
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,980
Tough guy.

602
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:57,500
You see his goal against Chelsea
from his own half?

603
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,500
Boom!

604
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:04,340
The ball flies up, over Courtois' head.
Cross the line, line. Goal!

605
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:09,570
He's not in China.
He's in the bloody takeaway down the road.

606
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:12,700
You two, you're taking the piss.

607
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:17,940
Okay, Stan Li,
I'll e-mail you my best price. Top price.

608
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,940
I'm gonna see how I get on selling
these ones I've got, okay?

609
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,420
So I'll let you know.

610
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,940
Best price, no bullshit.

611
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:28,780
Remember, Charlie Charlie, all good money.

612
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:31,980
Okay, no best price, no more trainer.

613
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,540
No more business.

614
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:36,100
No more talkie-talkie. No more...

615
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:40,700
# Swing low, sweet chariot

616
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:44,580
# Coming for to carry me home #

617
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:56,820
Right, Dan.
Check your National Insurance Number.

618
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,380
Yep, that's okay.

619
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,380
Press that button right there, Bill Gates.

620
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,540
- What, this one here?
- That one there, "Send."

621
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:10,020
Huh. It's taken me bloody days
to get this sorted out.

622
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,340
Well done, son.

623
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,860
Jobseeker's Application done.

624
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:21,980
Dan, don't know why you're applying
for that after your heart attack.

625
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:27,660
Right, now I'm printing your appeal form
for Employment and Support Allowance.

626
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:32,420
But you can't appeal till they carry out
a mandatory reconsideration.

627
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,460
Is that printing out now?

628
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:39,580
You mean, they could have
given it to me just like that?

629
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:44,300
Dan, they'll fuck you around,
I'm warning you.

630
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,500
Make it as miserable as possible.

631
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:48,780
No accident. That's the plan.

632
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,780
I know dozens who have just given up.

633
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:54,500
Well they've picked the wrong one
if they think I'm gonna give up.

634
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,060
I'm like a dog with a bone, me, son.

635
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,060
I have a note on the screen, sir,

636
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:08,110
that you're awaiting a call
from the decision maker.

637
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,700
Jesus, 55 minutes
to hear all this again.

638
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,180
Am I in a time warp?

639
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,040
You can't proceed to the appeal

640
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,940
or the mandatory reconsideration

641
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,100
till you have the call
from the decision maker.

642
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,500
Well, can you ask him to phone us
now, because I've got no income.

643
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:25,100
I've got no pension
and I've still got the bedroom tax.

644
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,790
I'll make a note on my screen, sir.

645
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,520
Well can you not give
him the note now?

646
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,100
You know, put it in his hand?

647
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,350
This is a call centre, sir.

648
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,780
Hey, Dylan. D'you want a shot
at the screwdriver?

649
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:14,140
What kills more people,
coconuts or sharks?

650
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:30,020
He likes bouncing that ball, doesn't he?

651
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,130
Pardon?

652
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,820
That ball.
He likes bouncing it, doesn't he?

653
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:38,140
Well, it started in the hostel
where we had only one small room.

654
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,100
Why d'you think he does that?

655
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,980
I think he's missing his friends.

656
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:47,180
But he also does it when he's angry.

657
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,500
People never listen to him,
so why should he listen to them?

658
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:05,220
There you go. And we don't need
any glue, nothing like that.

659
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:09,020
Now you give me a hand
and we'll stick this up.

660
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:14,940
Right, you go that end
and I'll go this end.

661
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,220
And we'll stick this up here.

662
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,340
Yeah? Just pass it up here.

663
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:23,020
Aye, right. You do the bottom edge.
That's it.

664
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:28,740
The sun heats up all
the air in these bubbles...

665
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:32,220
And it'll keep your room nice and warm.

666
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,900
Can you go into my tool bag there,

667
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:41,220
there's a piece of cloth.

668
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,220
Can you open it?

669
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,450
Eh?

670
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,350
- What do you think of that?
- It's gorgeous.

671
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:02,540
Well it's a little present for
your new room.

672
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,260
- Now...
- Thank you.

673
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:07,180
- Where shall we put it?
- Up there, maybe.

674
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,060
Okay, hang on.

675
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,660
I'll get a hook and hang it there.

676
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,700
Yeah, what do you think?

677
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,480
It's great.

678
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,260
It'll look like you're under the sea.

679
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:20,460
And the sun will shine on them.

680
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,940
I think there will be fine, yeah?

681
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,260
I'll light these candles.

682
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,490
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

683
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,260
- Now hang on.
- That one's big.

684
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,860
It is. Now there's four candles. Right?

685
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,360
Mind you don't burn yourself.

686
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,900
I won't burn meself,
don't worry about that.

687
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,900
But thank you for thinking about us, Daisy.

688
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,220
Put that in there like that.

689
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,940
And I put this one in here.
Now there's four candles in there, right.

690
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,700
And they last for four hours.

691
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:53,660
I'll put this small pot over. Right?

692
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,100
Block the hole off up there.

693
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:00,300
And then I put this big pot over the top.

694
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:05,300
Now it takes a little while
but it'll take the chill off the room.

695
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:09,260
And if you just put your hand
over there now, you'll feel it, Daisy.

696
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:12,230
If you just put your hand over there,
you'll feel it starting to warm up.

697
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:15,780
- Huh, can you feel it? Yeah?
- A little bit.

698
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:18,500
- What about you?
- Yeah, a little bit.

699
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,460
Were you a soldier, Dan?

700
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,140
Was I a soldier?

701
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:25,650
Oh, more dangerous than that.
I was a carpenter.

702
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,440
Right, grub's ready.

703
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,960
- Yay!
- Go round that way then, Dylan.

704
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,980
Good boy. There's yours, poppet.

705
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,370
Right, put Sweet on there.

706
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,580
Sit down nicely then.

707
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,920
- And, Dan, this one's yours.
- Oh, no, not for me, thanks, no.

708
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,340
That's yours. All right?

709
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,980
Here you are. All right?

710
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:50,310
- Well, where's yours?
- I had mine earlier.

711
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,750
I'm just gonna have a bit of fruit.

712
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,420
You said that yesterday,
and the day before.

713
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,100
All right, eat up then.

714
00:40:56,350 --> 00:41:00,220
Looks delicious but, you know,
it's a wee... It's a wee bit early for me.

715
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,780
Please, Dan. It's the least I can do.

716
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:07,140
- Thank you, Katie.
- All right.

717
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,180
What was that sound, Mum?

718
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:10,990
Oh, babe, one of the tiles just fell off
the wall in the bathroom

719
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,260
where I was cleaning it.

720
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:13,420
It's the middle of the night.

721
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,760
- I know.
- You should really get to bed.

722
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:16,040
Okay. I'm gonna go to bed.

723
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,100
I'm gonna go to bed.

724
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,960
I just wanted to
get all the cleaning done in there

725
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:20,470
so you can have a nice bath tomorrow.

726
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,420
You like a bath, don't ya?

727
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:23,860
Yeah?

728
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:26,570
So you're gonna go up
and get into bed and wrap up nicely.

729
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:29,460
Okay, good girl.
Give me a kiss.

730
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:34,500
Go and get into bed.

731
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:37,560
- All right? Good girl.
- Promise me you'll get to bed.

732
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,460
I promise you I'm gonna go to bed.

733
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:42,590
- Good night.
- 'Night, baby.

734
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,380
Daniel Blake?

735
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,420
If you'd like to follow me, Mr Blake.

736
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,660
If you'd like to just take a seat.

737
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:11,660
This is the Claimant Commitment form.

738
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:15,540
You must commit yourself to spending
35 hours a week looking for work.

739
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:19,020
Now that can be newspapers, agencies,

740
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:22,540
and online via the Universal Job Match.

741
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,580
You just fill in the details.

742
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:28,820
But you must prove that
you've done this as well, mind.

743
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:32,900
Well I've been told by my doctor that I'm
not supposed to go back to work yet.

744
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:36,140
Then you should apply
for Employment and Support Allowance.

745
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:39,580
I have, but I've been knocked
back by some quack

746
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,380
and now I'm trying to appeal.

747
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:44,540
Okay. Well that's your choice, Mr Blake.

748
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:46,820
No, it's not my choice.

749
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,140
I've got no other form of income.

750
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:52,700
Do you want to sign this or not?

751
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:58,940
You just need to put your
signature here. I shall date it later on.

752
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:07,140
Thank you.

753
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:09,860
Now can I have a look at your CV?

754
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:11,630
"CV"?

755
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:15,220
You still don't get this, do you, Mr Blake?

756
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:20,570
This is an agreement between
you and the State.

757
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:22,610
No, you still don't get it.

758
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:25,620
- No, you must...
- I'm desperate to go back to work.

759
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:28,740
- If you're desperate to get back to work...
- Unless the doctor tells us...

760
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:30,820
You need to have an up-to-date CV,

761
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:33,180
in order to help you look for work.

762
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:35,060
Now, just hold it right there.

763
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:39,580
There's a CV workshop
that I would like you to attend

764
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:43,620
and it's this Saturday at 9:00.

765
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:46,220
No, thanks, I'll sort that out on me own.

766
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:51,100
No, Mr Blake.
This is a formal direction.

767
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:56,650
You will attend if you want to proceed
with your Jobseeker's Allowance claim.

768
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:58,580
What happens if I don't?

769
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:01,660
Then you will be referred for a sanction.

770
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:08,690
Ten seconds.

771
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:11,300
Ten short seconds.

772
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:16,900
That's how much a typical employer
spends flipping through a CV.

773
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:18,340
Fact.

774
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:22,100
Sixty applications for
every low-skilled job.

775
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:23,230
Fact.

776
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:26,700
For a skilled job, it's twenty to one.

777
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:27,900
Fact.

778
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:31,740
Costa Coffee advertised eight jobs.

779
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:35,220
D'you know how many applications
they got from that?

780
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,740
Over 1,300.

781
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:39,370
Fact.

782
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:42,740
So, what does that mean?

783
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:45,510
We should all be drinking
a lot more bloody coffee.

784
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:47,680
Yeah, d'you wanna share that with us?

785
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:50,120
I said, we should all be drinking
a lot more bloody coffee then.

786
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:51,880
This is serious business

787
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:54,290
and people have only got
one shot at this, all right?

788
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:57,660
Well if you can count, it's obvious.
There's not enough jobs. Fact.

789
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:00,630
Yeah, well, you'll be at
the back of the queue, won't you?

790
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:03,860
For those of us in the real world,

791
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:07,260
what that means is...

792
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:16,380
"You must stand

793
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:21,180
"out from the crowd."

794
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:26,900
Get noticed. Get smart.

795
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:30,620
It's not enough these days just to, er,

796
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:32,740
just to show you have the skills.

797
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,940
You have to prove

798
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:39,020
how keen you are.
How dedicated.

799
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:40,690
Okay...

800
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:44,970
What I'd like you to do now
is to, er, format your CVs.

801
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:49,900
And, remember, all of these
have to be typed up in a clear font

802
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:51,810
in hard copy.

803
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:55,660
And we're also gonna need
a digital version for online.

804
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:57,780
And some companies,

805
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:03,140
they're demanding CV videos,
sent in by smartphone.

806
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,770
How about that?

807
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:07,940
Okay? Let's make a start.

808
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:34,820
Are you taking any blokes on, mate?

809
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:39,790
I'm a joiner, you know
I'm just looking for some work, you know.

810
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:42,660
Not at the minute. Er, all manned up.

811
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:46,420
Okay, can, can I give you my CV?
And then if you can get in touch...

812
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:55,380
- Excuse me, mate.
- Yeah.

813
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:57,810
D'you know if anybody's
taking anybody on round here?

814
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,300
Er, no, we're not taking anyone on.

815
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:02,810
Er, I'll tell you what you could do.

816
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:05,870
If you try about three units
up on the left there,

817
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,960
they'll probably...
They, they might be havin' one.

818
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:09,660
- Okay, thanks.
- Okay? Cheers, mate.

819
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:13,950
- Your best bet is to see him.
- Is he the boss? Him?

820
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:15,950
He's, he's the supervisor.
That's the boss there.

821
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:23,860
Excuse me, mate. D'you know if
they're taking anybody on here?

822
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:25,860
Have you got any jobs ganning?

823
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:27,970
No, you haven't?

824
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:31,510
Hey, mate, I'm looking for some work.

825
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:34,840
- Is there anything ganning on around here?
- There's nowt here, mate. There's...

826
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:36,780
There might be something,
erm, a bit further up,

827
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:38,950
- if you try one of the other estates, but...
- Yeah?

828
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:40,860
...nothing doing on here.

829
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:56,100
Help you, mate?

830
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:57,920
Aye, I was just looking
for some work, mate.

831
00:49:57,950 --> 00:49:59,860
I was wondering if you had
anything ganning on?

832
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:01,540
I might have.

833
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:02,760
- Aye?
- Done this graft before?

834
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:05,660
- You got any experience?
- Oh, I've got 40 years of experience, mate.

835
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:07,670
I can turn me hand to owt.
Can I give you me CV?

836
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:09,380
Way-ay, course, I'll have a look at it.

837
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:13,140
There you go.

838
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:15,890
Cheers.

839
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:17,860
- Daniel?
- Aye, that's me.

840
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:19,460
I'm Harry, by the way.

841
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:24,320
Well, you've got plenty
of experience, like, I've gotta be honest,

842
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:25,940
I'm absolutely sick of young'uns.

843
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:28,750
Half the time they divvent turn up.
When they do, they cannot be arsed.

844
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:40,820
Dylan, Dylan, come off the road, come on.

845
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:42,380
Come on.

846
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:47,780
Dylan, come on.
Catch up. Come on.

847
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:02,620
- Is this the, er, queue for the food bank?
- It is, aye.

848
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:03,930
D'you know how long we'll be waiting?

849
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:06,980
Oh, a canny long time, I reckon.
We've been here ages already.

850
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:08,650
Okay, thanks. Cheers.

851
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:47,180
- Hello.
- Hello.

852
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:49,380
How nice to see you.

853
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,540
Have you brought your little dog today?

854
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:53,620
Thank you very much, thank you.

855
00:51:57,390 --> 00:52:01,010
Is it just food for yourself
and the two children, Katie? Thank you.

856
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:03,590
Would your children have
a drink of juice and a biscuit?

857
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,740
Would you like to go and see Agnes?

858
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:09,060
Agnes?
Could you do a juice and a biscuit, please?

859
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:12,980
- Jackie?
- Yeah.

860
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:15,870
Would you be able to
help Katie with her shopping today, please?

861
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:17,310
- There you are.
- Thank you.

862
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:20,260
- Hiya, Katie.
- Thank you.

863
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:25,050
So, we've got one adult and two
children, yeah? Come with me.

864
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:27,870
- We'll start with the vegetables, yeah?
- Okay.

865
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:31,420
Right.

866
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:34,500
I'll give you one side and
we'll share it, yeah?

867
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:38,440
- Couple of onions.
- Is there anything we can do for you, hun?

868
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:40,060
- No, I'm fine, thanks.
- Are you sure?

869
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:42,230
- Aye, all right then.
- Toiletries, yeah?

870
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:44,820
Okay...

871
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,350
Have you just moved up here?
Your accent's not from here.

872
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:50,000
- You're not a Geordie girl.
- Yeah. Yeah, been up a little while.

873
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:51,090
Just come up from London.

874
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:53,060
Right. Nice accent.

875
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:55,060
Can you understand the Geordies?

876
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:56,210
Almost.

877
00:52:57,070 --> 00:52:58,130
Right, over here.

878
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:00,610
I think we need another bag.
Have we got one?

879
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:02,540
Did you bus here?

880
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:05,740
- No? Well, sometimes.
- Well, sometimes.

881
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:07,660
She likes tea sometimes.

882
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:10,100
- Well, I'll just keep going in with stuff.
- Yeah.

883
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:11,920
And then you tell me
what you don't need, yeah?

884
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:13,270
Have you got any sanitary towels?

885
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:16,440
- We don't have sanitary towels, no.
- No? All right, not to worry. It's all right.

886
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:18,080
- Don't really donate things much like that.
- Yeah.

887
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:19,540
It's a shame, they should.

888
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:23,100
Right, right, if you open your bag. Rice?

889
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:34,940
- And a couple of toilet rolls?
- Mmm-hmm.

890
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:36,100
Yeah?

891
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:39,060
We'll go to the food.
It's falling out me bag.

892
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:41,660
- You can put...
- I've got this one. Right.

893
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:45,860
Erm, tins in yours.
Put them in there.

894
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:50,260
Can you see anything else you want?

895
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:52,430
- There you go.
- Okay, thank you.

896
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:55,020
- Erm, there's pasta sauce over here.
- Mmm-hmm.

897
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:56,940
I'll get you some pasta sauce?

898
00:53:57,950 --> 00:53:59,260
The pasta sauce...

899
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:05,820
And there's, er, pasta here as well.
I'll get you a pasta.

900
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:15,140
Hey, pet, are you all right?
What are you doing? What are you doing?

901
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:20,020
Come and sit down. It's all right.
It's all right, it's all right.

902
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,300
Come and sit down.
Come and sit down, it's all right.

903
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:24,140
Oh...

904
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:30,100
Okay, it's all right.
It's all right, it's all right.

905
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:31,590
It's all right. D'you want a drink?

906
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:34,180
- D'you want a drink?
- I'm really sorry...

907
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:37,280
- What's the matter?
- It's okay, don't worry.

908
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:39,590
- I'll get you a drink.
- Mum, what's going on?

909
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:41,540
It's okay. It's okay

910
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:45,300
I'm just really hungry.

911
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:50,180
- Okay, don't look at me.
- No, no, no, it's okay, it's okay.

912
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:53,340
There's no harm done.

913
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:59,540
I can't cope, Dan.
I feel like I'm going under.

914
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:01,580
Look, you'll get through this, darling.

915
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:03,390
- Thank you.
- You'll get through this.

916
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:06,420
Katie, listen to me.
This isn't your fault.

917
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:10,180
You've done amazing.

918
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:12,780
Dumped up here, on your own with two kids.

919
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:14,820
You've done nothing to be ashamed of.

920
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:16,860
Come on, you're okay.

921
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:18,340
Come on, wipe yourself.

922
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:22,420
Come on... You're okay.

923
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:26,180
- If my mum could see me...
- It's okay.

924
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:29,900
Look, these people are here to help you.

925
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:32,000
You know, you've done nothing
to be ashamed of.

926
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:33,940
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, you're all right.

927
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:35,840
- Can I get you anything else?
- I just felt really faint.

928
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:38,220
D'you need some paper
tissues or baby wipes?

929
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:40,220
- I'll get you some baby wipes.
- Thank you.

930
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:44,100
I felt really faint.

931
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:47,980
Katie, can I get you something to eat?
Would you like some soup or something?

932
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:50,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
If you could get her some water.

933
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:52,930
Sure, yeah, anything. Yeah.
You not want some food?

934
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:55,260
- Yeah, please, get...
- Even something sugary.

935
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:56,780
I'll get you a doughnut or something.

936
00:55:56,910 --> 00:55:58,130
Yeah, yeah?

937
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:10,270
There's no middlemen.
Straight from the factory.

938
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:11,940
Same quality as the shop.

939
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:14,240
- Same quality, exactly.
- Well, you're gonna have to do us a deal.

940
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:15,250
I couldn't pay 80 quid for this, though.

941
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:17,620
If you go to the shop, they're 150 pounds.

942
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:19,680
- A hundred and fifty quid?
- I'm selling these for 80 pounds.

943
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,880
- Only 80 quid.
- See, they've still got the stickers on.

944
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:24,540
Why are they 80?

945
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:27,680
The reason they're 80 is because
there's no middlemen, nothing.

946
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:30,710
- No middlemen, whatsoever.
- You and Piper, the top new businessmen.

947
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:32,280
That's my driver, Dan.

948
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:33,950
I'll give you a bloody driver.

949
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:35,440
So no-one's worn them before?

950
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:37,480
No-one's wore them. Nothing, look.
Check the quality yourself.

951
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:39,100
I'd probably wear them for the gym.

952
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,720
I couldn't say 80 quid, mate.
This is too expensive for 80 quid.

953
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:44,710
- They're 150 pound in the shop.
- A hundred and fifty pound, yeah.

954
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:50,500
- Oh, Dan. You all right, mate?
- Hello, Joe.

955
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:53,750
- Aye, I'm all right, mate, aye.
- How are you doing?

956
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:57,300
Erm, listen, we're ganning, erm...
We're away down the pub the night.

957
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:59,320
There's a load of us ganning.
There's a band on, you know.

958
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:02,300
We're gonna sink a few pints.
D'you fancy, fancy coming down?

959
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:06,140
Aye, I'd murder a pint, mate, but I daresn't.
I've been telt to lay off the sauce, you know.

960
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:08,340
- Oh, really?
- But, listen, tell the lads I'll come down

961
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:09,780
and pop into the sawmill, eh?

962
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:11,340
Oh, aye, aye, aye.

963
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:13,820
You know, if you fancy it anyway,
we're all going down.

964
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:15,340
So we might see you later, mate.

965
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,830
- Nice to see you, man.
- See you then. Ta-ta, see you.

966
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:29,790
Message for Daniel Blake.

967
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:33,340
Mr Blake, this is a call
from the DWP decision maker.

968
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:35,660
You should soon receive a letter

969
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:38,140
which states that you have been
deemed fit for work

970
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:41,220
and not entitled to Employment
and Support Allowance.

971
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:43,580
If you need any further information,

972
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:46,380
it's available online.
Thank you.

973
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:51,420
Fuck's sake.

974
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:15,740
- Hello?
- Hi, is that Daniel?

975
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:17,220
Yes, it is. Hi.

976
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:18,920
Hi, Daniel, it's Harry Edwards here.

977
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:20,360
We spoke the other day
at the garden centre...

978
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:22,200
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- ...when you came down and handed your CV.

979
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:25,400
- How are you doing, mate? Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, thanks, yeah.

980
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:27,800
Er, listen. I tell you what, mate,
I've been going through all the CVs

981
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:29,600
I've had handed over the
last couple of weeks.

982
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:31,260
And I really like the look of yours.

983
00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:33,230
Erm, you've got the experience
I'm looking for.

984
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:36,790
I was wondering if you could possibly, er,
pop by tomorrow and that for an interview?

985
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:40,100
Oh... I'm really sorry, er, Mr Edwards,

986
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:43,420
but, you know, er, my doctor's told
us I cannae come back to work yet.

987
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:47,110
So you're not actually
looking for work, then?

988
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:49,300
Well, it's hard to explain, you know.

989
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:52,840
So, well, what's the point
of handing in your CV

990
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:54,420
if you're not looking for work?

991
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:57,070
Well it's the only way
I can get me benefits, you know?

992
00:58:57,470 --> 00:59:01,060
"Benefits"? So you prefer to be on
benefits than do a day's graft?

993
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:02,950
You know, I thought you were
a genuine bloke.

994
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:05,040
You know, I've spent a lot of time
going through them all.

995
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:06,830
I've... I was gonna put
some graft your way.

996
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:09,990
You've just wasted my time completely.
Why don't you just sod right off!

997
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:12,070
Listen, that's not...

998
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:44,460
- That's your change and your receipt.
- Thank you.

999
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:46,460
- Thank you very much. Have a good day.
- Bye.

1000
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:47,980
- Bye.
- Thank you, bye.

1001
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:50,490
Excuse me, madam.
I think you've been shoplifting.

1002
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:53,830
Would you like to come with me to the
manager's office and we can sort it out?

1003
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:55,130
I haven't been shoplifting.

1004
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:57,640
Okay, you have, and I've seen you.
So if you'd like to come with me...

1005
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:59,240
No, I've got a receipt.
I've got, I've just,

1006
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:01,880
- the lady there's just served me.
- Okay, and if everything on your receipt

1007
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:03,360
is all you've got on you,
then there's no problem.

1008
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:05,480
If you'd just like to come this way
to the manager's office.

1009
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:06,490
No, I'm not going to the manager's office.

1010
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:08,800
You just stood there and watched
her serve me, I've got a receipt.

1011
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:10,430
I can lock the door and call the police.

1012
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:12,440
You're talking about locking the
door and calling the police.

1013
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:14,080
Would you like to come with me
to the manager's office?

1014
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,990
No, because I've just, you've
just watched me...

1015
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,270
Okay, and we'll sort that out.

1016
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:19,480
Okay, and if everything
on the receipt's in your bags,

1017
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:21,240
- then there's no problem.
- You don't need to shout at me.

1018
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:22,750
Okay, if you'd like to come this way.

1019
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:25,760
She's just, you've just stood
there and watched it...

1020
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:28,120
- Okay, then we'll sort it out.
- ...and serve me with, didn't you?

1021
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:29,540
And she's given me a receipt.

1022
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:30,780
Just this way.

1023
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:51,380
Ivan, I'll take it from here.

1024
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:54,340
What's your name, love?

1025
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,420
- Katie.
- Katie?

1026
01:00:56,550 --> 01:00:58,660
- Katie Morgan.
- Katie Morgan.

1027
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:00,220
I'm really sorry.

1028
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:03,010
I haven't done anything like this before.
I've paid for these.

1029
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:08,700
What are you gonna do?

1030
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:12,180
Katie.

1031
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:15,420
It's between me and you...

1032
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:18,900
It's got nowt to do with the store.
All right?

1033
01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:21,900
They're paid for.

1034
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:27,780
Get yoursel' away.

1035
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:33,780
Thank you.

1036
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:50,580
Hey, hang on a second.
Hey, hang on...

1037
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:53,020
I'm sorry about that, I am.

1038
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:54,940
Can I get a quiet word?

1039
01:01:56,070 --> 01:02:00,300
Look, if you're in trouble and you
need money, I can help, okay?

1040
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:03,390
Look, a nice girl like you,
I can definitely help.

1041
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:07,010
That's my number.
My name's Ivan, okay?

1042
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:13,060
Ring me any time, all right?

1043
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:14,460
Okay?

1044
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:37,780
Come and have a look at this.

1045
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:41,890
That is a miracle.

1046
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:43,710
He's been sat there for about 15 minutes.

1047
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:03,060
What's this, Dan?

1048
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:04,660
It's a cassette.

1049
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:06,050
What's a cassette?

1050
01:03:06,430 --> 01:03:08,150
Plays music. Come here, I'll show you.

1051
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:15,740
All right.

1052
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:20,140
You pop that in there. Oh, no, you
gotta take it out the case first.

1053
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:23,340
It'll not play like that.

1054
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:26,190
Right, you put that in
there like that. Yeah?

1055
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:28,860
And press that button there.

1056
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:33,460
Bit more. Harder.

1057
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:35,010
That's it.

1058
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:38,250
It was Molly's.

1059
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:40,940
She recorded it off the radio.

1060
01:03:41,710 --> 01:03:42,710
Shipping forecast.

1061
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:44,700
It's on late at night.

1062
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:48,420
Sailing By.
D'you like that tune?

1063
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:50,700
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Molly loved it.

1064
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,100
It's nice, isn't it?

1065
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:12,380
So how'd the interview go?

1066
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:15,340
Oh, nothing's working out
with the school times at the minute.

1067
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:18,950
So I went to, erm, some of the agencies
and put my name down on the waiting list,

1068
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:20,750
cos I could do cleaning in the morning.

1069
01:04:21,110 --> 01:04:23,740
Went to some hotels.
Went round all the cafes.

1070
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,500
Must have walked for bloody miles.

1071
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:27,760
Well, I can pick the kids
up for you, you know.

1072
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:28,980
Till I start work again.

1073
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:38,130
Dan. The answer is "coconuts".

1074
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:40,900
Correct.

1075
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:42,910
What's he talking about, "coconuts"?

1076
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:44,980
Ah, shall we tell your mum?

1077
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:50,380
- Go on.
- When I was bouncing my ball on the stairs.

1078
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:52,760
- What stairs?
- The stairs in our house.

1079
01:04:52,790 --> 01:04:55,660
- Yeah.
- Dan asked me a question.

1080
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:57,380
What, what question did he ask ya?

1081
01:04:57,790 --> 01:04:59,620
"What kills people more?

1082
01:04:59,790 --> 01:05:01,780
- "Coconuts or sharks?"
- Mmm-hmm.

1083
01:05:01,790 --> 01:05:03,140
And I said coconuts.

1084
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:04,390
And you got it right?

1085
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:06,030
- Is that right?
- Yeah, he's right.

1086
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:12,650
Is that Molly?

1087
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:16,340
Yeah. Yeah, that's Molly, yeah.

1088
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:18,820
Let's see that, Dais.

1089
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:20,820
Show me that one.

1090
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:27,220
"Molly." Like the name.

1091
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:29,580
What was she like?

1092
01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:31,860
She was special.

1093
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:35,620
Yeah, she was special, Daisy.

1094
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:38,460
Not easy.

1095
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:42,220
She was up one minute, down the next.

1096
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:46,860
Smart and funny. Huh.

1097
01:05:48,670 --> 01:05:50,860
Ah, that lass made me laugh.

1098
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:54,010
Kind.

1099
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:56,970
She had a big, big heart.

1100
01:05:58,870 --> 01:05:59,870
But...

1101
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:04,300
She said her head
was like the ocean.

1102
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:09,020
Dead still, then wild.

1103
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:12,860
Never knew where she'd end up next.

1104
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:16,300
I mean, the music helped that.

1105
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:19,620
But then she'd hit the rocks.

1106
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:22,300
"Where'll we sail to tonight, Dan?"

1107
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:24,340
That was our little joke.

1108
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:27,140
Her last words to me were,

1109
01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:33,940
"I wanna sail away, Dan,
with the wind at me back.

1110
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:37,050
"That's all I need, Dan."

1111
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:41,010
Do you have any children?

1112
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:45,060
I'd have loved that, Daisy. No.

1113
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:48,260
- Do you miss her?
- Dais.

1114
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:50,020
It's okay.

1115
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:52,900
She was crazy.

1116
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,700
Hard work.

1117
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:00,180
But I loved her to bits.

1118
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:04,580
I'm lost without her, really.

1119
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:10,390
- There you go, pet.
- Oh, thank you.

1120
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:12,940
That must have been hard for you, Dan.

1121
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:15,150
I mean, did you look after her
right till the end?

1122
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:19,940
Well, you know, I thought it'd be
a relief when she passed away.

1123
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:23,970
Cos it was difficult to go into work,
you know, when she was ill.

1124
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:28,100
And after you've been looking after
somebody for so long...

1125
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:30,700
It seems to take over your life, you know.

1126
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:33,070
- Yeah, and you forget your own.
- Huh.

1127
01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:36,340
Well she was lucky to have you.

1128
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:41,690
Daisy's dad, I thought was
something really special.

1129
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:44,170
He turned out not to be.

1130
01:07:44,950 --> 01:07:47,940
Me mum tried to warn me about it,
but I was 18, so I didn't listen.

1131
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:50,980
And then I did the same
thing with Dylan's dad.

1132
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:54,830
You're a young lass,
you got your whole life ahead of you.

1133
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:57,970
And when you get back
to those books, you'll be flying.

1134
01:07:58,990 --> 01:08:01,100
Yeah, I can't look at 'em, Dan.
They really upset me.

1135
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:05,980
- You gotta keep a hold, you know.
- Mmm-hmm.

1136
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:08,220
You're doing your kids proud.

1137
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:15,980
I mean, we all need the wind
at our back every now and then.

1138
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:18,660
- Don't we?
- Mmm. Yeah.

1139
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:31,060
Well that's not good enough, Mr Blake.

1140
01:08:32,590 --> 01:08:36,420
And how do I know you've actually
been in contact with all these employers?

1141
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:40,660
Well, I walked round the town.
I gave out me CV by hand.

1142
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:42,900
Well, prove it.

1143
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:45,690
- How?
- Well, did you get a receipt?

1144
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:47,420
Take a picture with your mobile?

1145
01:08:49,030 --> 01:08:50,030
With this?

1146
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:52,540
I give you my word that's what I did.

1147
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:54,430
That's not good enough, Mr Blake.

1148
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:57,940
What about the Universal Job Match online?

1149
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:02,020
I went to the library,
there's my appointment card.

1150
01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:08,340
Did my head in. And I tried my best.

1151
01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:11,060
It's not good enough.

1152
01:09:12,070 --> 01:09:13,740
Can I look at your CV?

1153
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,180
All right.

1154
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:29,060
Did you not learn anything
at the CV workshop?

1155
01:09:29,350 --> 01:09:30,900
You'd be surprised.

1156
01:09:33,070 --> 01:09:34,700
Not good enough, Sheila?

1157
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:38,560
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to refer you

1158
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:42,060
to a decision maker for a possible
sanction for four weeks.

1159
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:45,380
Your payment will be frozen.

1160
01:09:46,110 --> 01:09:48,620
You may be entitled
to Hardship Allowance if you apply.

1161
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:50,900
Do you understand?

1162
01:09:52,110 --> 01:09:56,260
And if you are sanctioned, you must
continue to look for work and sign on.

1163
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:59,300
If you don't, you may be sanctioned again.

1164
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:04,100
And it's likely to be for thirteen weeks
on the second occasion, and thereafter.

1165
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:08,700
And likely to be the maximum
of up to three years.

1166
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:13,100
Would you like me to write
you a referral to a food bank?

1167
01:10:46,110 --> 01:10:47,860
Dan, you're not leaving, are you?

1168
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:49,580
Aye, I'm off to the Bahamas.

1169
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:53,140
Nah, I'm just sick of the old stuff.
I need a change.

1170
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:55,530
Are you okay, Dan?

1171
01:10:56,910 --> 01:10:57,940
I'm fine, son.

1172
01:10:58,310 --> 01:10:59,940
You don't look okay.

1173
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:01,580
No, really, I'm fine.

1174
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:04,850
You haven't given us a row
about leaving the rubbish out.

1175
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:07,300
I'm okay, China, really.

1176
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:10,540
If you need anything, Dan, let me know.

1177
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:12,180
Absolutely anything.

1178
01:11:15,190 --> 01:11:16,980
I mean it, Dan, anything.

1179
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:18,740
I know, son.

1180
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:23,460
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a hundred.

1181
01:11:23,590 --> 01:11:27,180
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, two hundred.

1182
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:29,140
All right?

1183
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:32,100
Aye, fair enough.

1184
01:11:32,710 --> 01:11:34,180
Anything else I can help you with?

1185
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:36,090
No, that's it.

1186
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:44,740
What about these?

1187
01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:46,210
Good quality hand tools.

1188
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:50,220
Nae chance. I'll be ganning back
to work soon enough.

1189
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:52,700
Well, the offer's there.

1190
01:11:54,590 --> 01:11:57,220
Now these look nice.
How much d'you want?

1191
01:11:58,030 --> 01:11:59,220
They're not for sale, mate.

1192
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:02,980
Give us a ring if you change
your mind. See you now.

1193
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:43,260
What are you doing?

1194
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:47,100
Oh, you're freezing.

1195
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:49,820
What's wrong?

1196
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:55,100
Well, erm, the girls at school
are making fun of me.

1197
01:12:56,190 --> 01:12:57,250
They're what?

1198
01:12:57,350 --> 01:12:59,620
The girls at school
are making fun of me.

1199
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:02,260
Why are they making fun of you?

1200
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:05,020
My shoes fell apart.

1201
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:06,300
Oh, did they?

1202
01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:09,710
But we glued them back together.

1203
01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:11,790
- Mmm.
- They fell apart again?

1204
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:17,030
All right, we can get you
a new pair of shoes.

1205
01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:18,790
We don't have the money.

1206
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:22,150
Don't you worry about that,
we can get you a new pair of shoes.

1207
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:24,260
Okay.

1208
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:29,100
One of the girls heard about
what happened at the food bank.

1209
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:33,190
And they're saying
things to you about that, are they?

1210
01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:36,030
We'll get it sorted,
don't you worry.

1211
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:39,870
D'you wanna sleep here with me?

1212
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:43,300
Yeah? All right, babe,
roll over then. Tuck in.

1213
01:13:44,230 --> 01:13:47,620
That's it. Roll right over.
I'll tuck you in.

1214
01:13:49,310 --> 01:13:50,420
Good girl.

1215
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:17,460
Hello?

1216
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:19,140
Hello, is that Ivan?

1217
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:21,340
It is, yeah. Who's that?

1218
01:14:22,110 --> 01:14:24,340
It's, it's Katie,
the girl at the supermarket.

1219
01:14:24,350 --> 01:14:26,380
You gave me... You gave me
your phone number.

1220
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:28,580
Okay, I remember you.

1221
01:14:29,150 --> 01:14:32,690
Yeah, I was, erm... I was ringing about
the work that you were talking about.

1222
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:13,820
It's nice to meet you.

1223
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:31,420
You don't need to be nervous
with me. I can see you're in pain.

1224
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:33,190
You don't...
You don't need to be, all right?

1225
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:35,420
I'm gonna help you. Okay?

1226
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:37,340
So, don't cry, right.

1227
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:39,420
I don't want you to cry,
I'm gonna help you.

1228
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:42,740
I know the situation. Ivan's told us a
little bit about you and, you know,

1229
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:44,830
and that's what I'm here for.
I am gonna help you.

1230
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:51,470
Hey, ya.

1231
01:15:52,190 --> 01:15:53,460
- All right?
- Yeah.

1232
01:15:54,070 --> 01:15:55,550
Did they, er, they go down all right?

1233
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:58,460
Nae bother. Both fast asleep. How'd it go?

1234
01:15:59,070 --> 01:16:02,660
Yeah, it was good, it was good.
It was a, it was a single-parent meeting.

1235
01:16:03,470 --> 01:16:06,160
One of the mums came and spoke
to me afterwards, she was really nice.

1236
01:16:06,190 --> 01:16:07,460
Ah, there's some good
people round, yeah.

1237
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:08,470
Yeah.

1238
01:16:10,470 --> 01:16:12,440
Make sure you take care
of yourself, Dan, won't ya?

1239
01:16:12,470 --> 01:16:13,790
- Course I will.
- All right.

1240
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:15,460
- See you soon.
- Good night.

1241
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:19,460
- Give my love to the kids in the morning.
- I will do.

1242
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:21,180
- Thank you.
- 'Night.

1243
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:29,540
Dan, it's me. Erm, thank you
for coming round tonight.

1244
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:34,140
Daisy woke up and she forgot to ask
you about her school project.

1245
01:17:34,350 --> 01:17:37,020
She's, erm, she's gotta interview
somebody about their work

1246
01:17:37,150 --> 01:17:38,540
and she wants to speak to you.

1247
01:17:39,310 --> 01:17:41,380
Oh, and they, they loved all your stories.

1248
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:44,550
She said that Dylan was just
laughing and laughing.

1249
01:17:45,550 --> 01:17:48,660
It was lovely. Nearly made me cry
when she told me.

1250
01:17:50,350 --> 01:17:54,580
All right, I'll speak to you soon.
Sleep well. 'Night.

1251
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:42,900
I've come to see the girl.

1252
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:44,620
Okay. Come in.

1253
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:53,700
Erm, do I pay you?

1254
01:18:54,070 --> 01:18:56,630
No, you pay the girl. It's that door there.

1255
01:18:57,630 --> 01:18:58,630
Right.

1256
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:10,620
Oh, no, Dan.

1257
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:17,020
Katie, you don't need to do this.

1258
01:19:19,990 --> 01:19:21,380
You shouldn't see me like this.

1259
01:19:22,990 --> 01:19:24,020
I'm sorry.

1260
01:19:25,870 --> 01:19:28,870
No, this, this is cut off. This is separate.
Can you... You need to get out.

1261
01:19:31,870 --> 01:19:34,710
Listen, I couldn't speak to you in the flat,
I need to speak to you now.

1262
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:36,730
Dan, please, get out.

1263
01:19:37,670 --> 01:19:39,580
Oh, Katie, please,
I need to speak to you.

1264
01:19:42,830 --> 01:19:44,660
I just wanna speak to you. Katie!

1265
01:19:44,670 --> 01:19:46,700
Dan, please, just go.

1266
01:19:49,670 --> 01:19:53,060
Dan, please, I don't want you here!
Will you just go, please!

1267
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:57,700
- I've built you a bookcase.
- What?

1268
01:19:57,910 --> 01:19:58,970
For your books.

1269
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:01,900
Oh, Dan. Please, just go.

1270
01:20:02,670 --> 01:20:05,000
- Please, just go, I don't want you here.
- This is breaking my heart.

1271
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:07,060
Dan, please, just leave me alone.

1272
01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:20,060
I've got 300 quid in my pocket.

1273
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:23,100
I can buy the kids fresh fruit.

1274
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:31,790
If you can't deal with it,
I can't see you any more.

1275
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:35,020
Listen, I've gotta go back inside.
D'you understand?

1276
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:40,190
I don't wanna speak to you any more.

1277
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:43,220
And don't show me any more love.

1278
01:20:46,510 --> 01:20:48,060
Cos you're gonna break me, Dan.

1279
01:21:17,310 --> 01:21:18,340
I don't understand.

1280
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:21,740
So what jobs have you actually applied for?

1281
01:21:23,710 --> 01:21:25,140
It's a monumental farce, isn't it?

1282
01:21:25,790 --> 01:21:30,780
You sitting there with your
friendly name tag on your chest, Ann,

1283
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:35,940
opposite a sick man looking
for nonexistent jobs,

1284
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:38,340
that I can't take anyway.

1285
01:21:38,950 --> 01:21:42,900
Wasting my time,
employers' time, your time.

1286
01:21:44,350 --> 01:21:47,580
And all it does is humiliate me,
grind me down.

1287
01:21:48,550 --> 01:21:51,140
Or is that the point,
to get my name off those computers?

1288
01:21:52,910 --> 01:21:54,300
Well, I'm not doing it any more.

1289
01:21:54,830 --> 01:21:55,970
I've had enough.

1290
01:21:57,830 --> 01:21:59,740
I want my date for my appointment

1291
01:21:59,830 --> 01:22:02,820
for my appeal for Employment and Support.

1292
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:05,140
- Have you not had that yet?
- No.

1293
01:22:06,830 --> 01:22:08,180
Please listen to me, Dan.

1294
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:14,780
It's a huge decision to come off JSA
without any other income coming in.

1295
01:22:15,150 --> 01:22:18,820
Look, it... It could be weeks before
your appeal comes through.

1296
01:22:18,910 --> 01:22:23,460
You see, there's no time limit
for a mandatory reconsideration.

1297
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:25,250
I've got a time limit.

1298
01:22:25,990 --> 01:22:27,860
And you might not win.

1299
01:22:29,830 --> 01:22:32,780
Please, just keep signing on.

1300
01:22:33,470 --> 01:22:35,900
Get somebody to help you
with the online job searches.

1301
01:22:36,030 --> 01:22:39,940
Otherwise, you could lose everything.

1302
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:44,940
Please don't do this.
I've seen it before.

1303
01:22:45,630 --> 01:22:49,660
Good people, honest people, on the street.

1304
01:22:51,710 --> 01:22:52,850
Thank you, Ann.

1305
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:57,420
But when you lose your self-respect,
you're done for.

1306
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:08,510
I'll be seeing you gentlemen later.

1307
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:42,660
Oh, wait until security sees this.

1308
01:24:01,070 --> 01:24:04,140
What's going on here?
What are you fucking playing at?

1309
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:07,310
- Aye-aye. You cannot touch us.
- Well that's clever, in't it?

1310
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:09,940
It's me new art installation.

1311
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:26,970
Eh? Certainly can, lads. Come on.

1312
01:24:28,670 --> 01:24:30,310
Look at this, you got all the technology.

1313
01:24:58,990 --> 01:25:01,500
- Look at this!
- I can't believe it.

1314
01:25:02,990 --> 01:25:05,740
I cannot believe it, man.
What have you done?

1315
01:25:06,230 --> 01:25:09,020
This is me new hobby.
Shall I put that on my CV?

1316
01:25:09,550 --> 01:25:11,930
Did you stop, even for a second,

1317
01:25:12,030 --> 01:25:14,490
to think about the consequences
of what you've done here?

1318
01:25:14,630 --> 01:25:18,060
All I know, mate,
is if I divvent get my appeal date,

1319
01:25:18,190 --> 01:25:21,020
I'll be here every day doing this.

1320
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:23,780
- Unbelievable. Every day?
- Every day.

1321
01:25:24,030 --> 01:25:26,100
Tell you what, Ben,
just phone the police. Okay.

1322
01:25:26,550 --> 01:25:28,320
I cannae... Listen, mate,
I cannot believe this now.

1323
01:25:28,350 --> 01:25:30,800
This is out of our hands.
We're gonna have to phone the cops, man.

1324
01:25:30,830 --> 01:25:32,960
Well, if youse had done your job
like you should have done,

1325
01:25:32,990 --> 01:25:34,400
I wouldn't have had to resort to this.

1326
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:36,340
I cannot believe it. I cannot believe it.

1327
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:39,940
Go on, lad, give him a hand.

1328
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:43,160
Yes!

1329
01:25:43,190 --> 01:25:45,180
Words of wisdom!

1330
01:25:45,630 --> 01:25:47,260
You're the man, wee man! Eh?

1331
01:25:47,630 --> 01:25:49,540
Fucking eh? Yeah!

1332
01:25:52,070 --> 01:25:53,500
Are youse out of work, mate?

1333
01:25:53,630 --> 01:25:55,260
Are you fucking...
Are you Daniel Blake?

1334
01:25:55,390 --> 01:25:56,420
I am Daniel Blake, yes.

1335
01:25:56,550 --> 01:25:58,140
Hey, this is Daniel Blake!

1336
01:25:58,270 --> 01:26:00,730
Fucking look at that. Yeah!

1337
01:26:00,870 --> 01:26:02,340
Yeah! Hey!

1338
01:26:05,350 --> 01:26:08,100
You look fucking freezing, pal.
Here, have my jacket.

1339
01:26:08,230 --> 01:26:10,060
- No, no.
- No, come on, man, have my fucking jacket.

1340
01:26:10,070 --> 01:26:12,360
It's all right, son.
Look after yoursel', eh?

1341
01:26:12,390 --> 01:26:13,700
Keep yoursel' warm like.

1342
01:26:13,830 --> 01:26:15,050
You're a gentleman.

1343
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:19,900
So what's, what's your appeal all about?

1344
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:24,980
Liar!

1345
01:26:27,110 --> 01:26:29,550
You're... You're under arrest
on suspicion of criminal damage.

1346
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:32,010
Hey, a miscarriage of justice, eh.

1347
01:26:32,110 --> 01:26:34,900
Slow down. Whoa. Back off.

1348
01:26:35,030 --> 01:26:36,090
All right, all right, all right.

1349
01:26:36,110 --> 01:26:37,820
What the fuck's going on? Eh?

1350
01:26:37,950 --> 01:26:41,100
You should be arresting the wankers
who came up with sanctions. Eh?

1351
01:26:41,950 --> 01:26:44,250
That preachy baldy cunt.
What's his name?

1352
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:46,900
Ian Duncan fucking what's-his-face.

1353
01:26:47,230 --> 01:26:48,870
Aye, and the posh dicks in their mansions

1354
01:26:48,950 --> 01:26:51,080
who came up with the fucking
bedroom tax for disabled...

1355
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:54,940
Listen, youse are all gonna
be out of a fucking job anyway.

1356
01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:58,100
Privatizing you, eh?
All the fucking Tories, man.

1357
01:26:58,230 --> 01:27:01,100
Aye, members
of the fucking big club, eh.

1358
01:27:01,110 --> 01:27:02,820
Fucking posh Eton twats.

1359
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:08,130
Sir Daniel fucking Blake, pal!

1360
01:27:08,150 --> 01:27:11,300
Hey, should be a statue
made for you, pal.

1361
01:27:11,950 --> 01:27:14,140
Fucking Sir Daniel Blake!

1362
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:16,540
Yer a fucking beauty!

1363
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:22,260
Yay!

1364
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:28,940
So, what happens now?

1365
01:27:29,230 --> 01:27:32,700
Right, this is a copy of the caution sheet.

1366
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:35,140
Because you fully admitted the offences

1367
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:37,140
and you've been of good
character in the past,

1368
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:40,140
we're cautioning you for the offence
of criminal damage,

1369
01:27:40,270 --> 01:27:42,700
under Section Five of the Public Order Act.

1370
01:27:43,870 --> 01:27:47,060
But please remember
that these can come back

1371
01:27:47,190 --> 01:27:50,100
and haunt you if you re-offend.

1372
01:27:50,190 --> 01:27:52,300
So try to keep yourself out of trouble.

1373
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:56,780
Aye.

1374
01:27:58,950 --> 01:28:01,510
- See him out, please.
- This way, Mr Blake.

1375
01:28:43,590 --> 01:28:46,340
Dan. Dan!

1376
01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:49,580
Come, I need to talk to you.

1377
01:28:52,150 --> 01:28:53,780
We called you loads of times.

1378
01:29:06,830 --> 01:29:07,940
Dan!

1379
01:29:10,790 --> 01:29:12,940
Mum's been so sad lately.

1380
01:29:13,790 --> 01:29:15,340
Why don't you speak to her?

1381
01:29:16,270 --> 01:29:17,980
Don't you have credit on the phone?

1382
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:32,270
I see you.

1383
01:29:38,190 --> 01:29:40,260
We understand what happened to your heart.

1384
01:29:41,070 --> 01:29:42,980
Mum spoke to one of your neighbours.

1385
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:46,060
We didn't know about it.

1386
01:29:57,790 --> 01:29:59,060
It's cold out here.

1387
01:30:01,310 --> 01:30:02,310
I'm freezing.

1388
01:30:06,230 --> 01:30:09,300
Please, Daisy, I'm not feeling very well.

1389
01:30:10,510 --> 01:30:12,100
I made you some couscous.

1390
01:30:13,270 --> 01:30:14,940
And Dylan sent you his lollipop.

1391
01:30:17,950 --> 01:30:19,300
He's really missing you, too.

1392
01:30:22,710 --> 01:30:24,300
Just go, Daisy, please.

1393
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:30,060
Can I ask you one question, Dan?

1394
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:34,020
Did you help us?

1395
01:30:35,710 --> 01:30:36,900
Suppose so.

1396
01:30:37,150 --> 01:30:38,660
So why can't I help you?

1397
01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:48,350
I'm sorry.

1398
01:30:49,910 --> 01:30:51,340
I'm sorry, Daisy.

1399
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:54,130
I'm really sorry.

1400
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:10,130
You know, I'm not usually a nervous person,
Katie, but I'm nervous about this.

1401
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:11,860
It's only natural, Dan.

1402
01:31:11,990 --> 01:31:13,380
I just want it done, you know?

1403
01:31:13,470 --> 01:31:16,380
Yeah. Well, you're prepared.
You got all your papers.

1404
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:18,380
You've got a good,
good person representing you.

1405
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:21,540
And then when you're done,
you can come, come to dinner to celebrate.

1406
01:31:22,230 --> 01:31:24,190
The kids are really looking
forward to seeing you.

1407
01:31:46,390 --> 01:31:50,420
Hi, er, Daniel Blake. I've come for my
appeal for the reinstatement of my...

1408
01:31:50,430 --> 01:31:52,420
Employment and Support Allowance.

1409
01:31:57,590 --> 01:31:59,660
- Daniel, hi. Hello. Are you all right?
- Hello.

1410
01:31:59,790 --> 01:32:02,140
- Hi, I'm Katie. I'm a friend of Daniel's.
- Hi.

1411
01:32:02,270 --> 01:32:04,570
- You're here for support, yeah?
- Yeah.

1412
01:32:06,430 --> 01:32:11,980
Daniel, your appeal will be heard by a
legally qualified chairperson and a doctor.

1413
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:14,060
- Aye, fingers crossed.
- Yeah...

1414
01:32:14,190 --> 01:32:16,700
If I lose this appeal,
I'm out on the streets.

1415
01:32:16,830 --> 01:32:20,780
Well, we've got some updated
reports here from your GP,

1416
01:32:21,030 --> 01:32:23,380
your own consultant and your
physiotherapist.

1417
01:32:24,030 --> 01:32:25,140
And they're all furious.

1418
01:32:26,390 --> 01:32:27,660
You're gonna win this, Dan.

1419
01:32:28,470 --> 01:32:30,060
I do this every week.

1420
01:32:32,150 --> 01:32:33,870
- I bet me life on it.
- I told ya.

1421
01:32:35,790 --> 01:32:40,420
Just be yourself,
answer the questions and relax.

1422
01:32:40,830 --> 01:32:42,420
I'm really confident.

1423
01:32:44,070 --> 01:32:45,460
D'you have any questions?

1424
01:32:46,110 --> 01:32:48,870
Well, I've got one or two things
I'd like to get off me chest.

1425
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:51,260
- But will they listen?
- It's the least they can do.

1426
01:32:51,590 --> 01:32:52,780
And can I go in with him?

1427
01:32:53,030 --> 01:32:54,460
I'll certainly ask.
Would you like her to?

1428
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:55,750
- Yeah. Definitely, yeah.
- Yeah?

1429
01:32:55,790 --> 01:32:58,220
Okay, I'll certainly ask.
No problem at all.

1430
01:32:58,470 --> 01:33:00,060
All right. Thank you.

1431
01:33:00,270 --> 01:33:02,980
My pleasure.
I'll just go and see what the score is.

1432
01:33:04,430 --> 01:33:06,460
- Yeah.
- Sounds good, don't it?

1433
01:33:08,390 --> 01:33:09,450
Look at them.

1434
01:33:10,630 --> 01:33:13,900
It's funny, they've got
my life in their hands.

1435
01:33:20,430 --> 01:33:21,490
Thanks, Katie, for coming.

1436
01:33:22,470 --> 01:33:23,780
Thank you for asking me.

1437
01:33:24,430 --> 01:33:26,260
You stubborn old bastard.

1438
01:33:31,910 --> 01:33:34,420
I think I'll go
and freshen up, yeah?

1439
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:35,660
All right.

1440
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:31,580
Can somebody, er,
phone an ambulance, please? 9-9-9.

1441
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:33,860
There's a guy collapsed in the toilet.
He's flat out.

1442
01:34:33,990 --> 01:34:36,660
Phone 9-9-9. Somebody, please.

1443
01:34:37,190 --> 01:34:38,330
Dan!

1444
01:34:38,510 --> 01:34:40,300
No! Dan!

1445
01:34:43,150 --> 01:34:44,580
Just had a heart attack.
Yeah, two breaths, please.

1446
01:34:44,590 --> 01:34:45,780
Oh, Dan!

1447
01:34:46,190 --> 01:34:49,380
- Just the two breaths...
- Is he breathing?

1448
01:34:49,710 --> 01:34:51,420
Oh, Dan.

1449
01:34:51,550 --> 01:34:52,840
Listen, we're trying to help
him as much as we can.

1450
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:55,580
No, no, no, please keep going,
please keep going. Don't stop.

1451
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:56,910
I'm afraid we've lost him.

1452
01:34:57,110 --> 01:35:01,580
No, don't say that,
please don't say that. No.

1453
01:35:02,590 --> 01:35:05,180
- No, please!
- I'm so sorry.

1454
01:35:05,310 --> 01:35:06,340
I'm sorry.

1455
01:35:06,590 --> 01:35:09,100
- Please...
- Where's the ambulance now?

1456
01:35:09,430 --> 01:35:11,700
- Please.
- No response at all.

1457
01:35:17,310 --> 01:35:19,690
Please. Please try again.

1458
01:36:11,790 --> 01:36:12,820
Erm...

1459
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:18,820
They call this a "pauper's funeral"
because it's the cheapest slot, at 9:00.

1460
01:36:21,310 --> 01:36:22,860
But Dan wasn't a pauper to us.

1461
01:36:24,670 --> 01:36:27,420
He gave us things that money can't buy.

1462
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:32,700
When he died, I found this on him.

1463
01:36:35,550 --> 01:36:37,460
He always used to write in pencil.

1464
01:36:39,470 --> 01:36:40,500
Erm...

1465
01:36:41,310 --> 01:36:45,700
And he wanted to read it at his appeal
but he never got the chance to.

1466
01:36:48,670 --> 01:36:51,540
And I swear that this lovely man,

1467
01:36:52,630 --> 01:36:53,980
had so much more to give,

1468
01:36:56,070 --> 01:36:59,260
and that the State drove him
to an early grave.

1469
01:37:03,430 --> 01:37:04,700
And this is what he wrote.

1470
01:37:07,230 --> 01:37:12,300
"I am not a client, a customer,
nor a service user.

1471
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:18,730
"I am not a shirker, a scrounger,
a beggar, nor a thief.

1472
01:37:19,830 --> 01:37:23,740
"I'm not a National Insurance Number
or blip on a screen.

1473
01:37:25,030 --> 01:37:29,140
"I paid my dues, never a penny short,
and proud to do so.

1474
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:35,690
"I don't tug the forelock, but look my
neighbour in the eye and help him if I can.

1475
01:37:36,950 --> 01:37:39,380
"I don't accept or seek charity.

1476
01:37:41,310 --> 01:37:46,380
"My name is Daniel Blake.
I am a man, not a dog.

1477
01:37:47,510 --> 01:37:49,780
"As such, I demand my rights.

1478
01:37:51,150 --> 01:37:53,380
"I demand you treat me with respect.

1479
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:58,500
"I, Daniel Blake, am a citizen,

1480
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:02,350
"nothing more and nothing less."

1481
01:38:03,630 --> 01:38:04,690
Thank you.
