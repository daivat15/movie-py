<font color="#ffff80">His family taken from him,
his kingdom in ruins,</font>

40
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,130
<font color="#ffff80">and his army destroyed

<font color="#ffff80">in search of
a magical suit of armor.</font>

00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,288
<font color="#ffff80">The only weapon
in the whole world</font>

<font color="#ffff80">that could protect him from
the power of the Moon King.</font>

46
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,124
<font color="#ffff80">This armor was
made up of three pieces.</font>

47
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,282
<font color="#ffff80">The first...
Oh! I know! I know!</font>

48
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,771
<font color="#ffff80">The sword unbreakable.</font>

49
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,251
<font color="#ffff80">The second...</font>

50
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,846
<font color="#ffff80">The breastplate...</font>

51
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,251
<font color="#ffff80">Impenetrable.</font>

52
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,651
<font color="#ffff80">Impenetra-bubble!</font>

53
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,085
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah!</font>

54
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,961
<font color="#ffff80">And finally,
the third weapon,</font>

55
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,565
<font color="#ffff80">the final piece
of the armor...</font>

56

<font color="#ffff80">I know this one. Pick me!</font>

57
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,321
<font color="#ffff80">The helmet invulnerable!</font>

58
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,923
<font color="#ffff80">Before Hanzo
could claim the armor</font>

59
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,083
<font color="#ffff80">and unite the pieces
to reveal their true power,</font>

64

<font color="#ffff80">Hanzo was filled with rage.</font>

65
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,606
<font color="#ffff80">His soul tormented</font>

66
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,251
<font color="#ffff80">by the grief of
a family stolen from him!</font>

67
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,045
<font color="#ffff80">At last, our hero was
face-to-face with his nemesis,</font>

68
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,281
<font color="#ffff80">the Moon King.</font>

69
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,403
<font color="#ffff80">So, be sure to
come back tomorrow.</font>

70
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,451
<font color="#ffff80">What? Oh, come on!</font>

71
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,760
<font color="#ffff80">People like an ending.</font>

72
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,885
<font color="#ffff80">Where are you going?</font>

73
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,770
<font color="#ffff80">No, you can't...
You can't leave!</font>

74
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,681
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo.</font>

75
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,322
<font color="#ffff80">- Kubo.
- Yes, Mother.</font>

76
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,446
<font color="#ffff80">I'm here.</font>

77
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,806
<font color="#ffff80">Hungry?</font>

78
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,607
<font color="#ffff80">And even though
he could barely see</font>

79
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,729
<font color="#ffff80">his own hand in
front of his face,</font>

80
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,811
<font color="#ffff80">Hanzo and his
army of loyal samurai</font>

81
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,769
<font color="#ffff80">pressed on
through the blizzard.</font>

82
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,767
<font color="#ffff80">And suddenly, as quickly
as it had started,</font>

83
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,646
<font color="#ffff80">the storm cleared
before him.</font>

84
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,964
<font color="#ffff80">Hanzo breathed a sigh of
relief, for he was home.</font>

85
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,201
<font color="#ffff80">His fortress?</font>

86
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,805
<font color="#ffff80">The Beetle Clan castle!
Yes.</font>

87
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,201
<font color="#ffff80">At the very edge
of the Far Lands,</font>

88
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,204
<font color="#ffff80">hidden from the Moon King
by powerful magic.</font>

89
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,201
<font color="#ffff80">And then what happened,
when he got to the castle?</font>

90
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,120
<font color="#ffff80">When who got
to the castle?</font>

91
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,725
<font color="#ffff80">Hanzo! My father!</font>

92
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,649
<font color="#ffff80">Hanzo”.
Hanzo was at the castle?</font>

93
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,124
<font color="#ffff80">He...</font>

94
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,205
<font color="#ffff80">Just give me
a second. I'm...</font>

95
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,569
<font color="#ffff80">No.</font>

96
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,211
<font color="#ffff80">It's gone. I can't...</font>

97
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,481
<font color="#ffff80">I'm sorry, Kubo.</font>

98
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,682
<font color="#ffff80">Perhaps I could recall
a different story.</font>

99
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,287
<font color="#ffff80">Mother, what was
Father like?</font>

100
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,086
<font color="#ffff80">Oh.</font>

101
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,401
<font color="#ffff80">This one is easy.</font>

102
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,008
<font color="#ffff80">Hanzo was a mighty warrior,
skilled with sword and bow.</font>

103
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,970
<font color="#ffff80">No, what was he
really like?</font>

104
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,442
<font color="#ffff80">When he wasn't fighting,
when he was with us.</font>

105
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,127
<font color="#ffff80">He was just like you.</font>

106
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,604
<font color="#ffff80">Like me?
Yes.</font>

107
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,003
<font color="#ffff80">Strong, and clever,
and funny,</font>

108
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,885
<font color="#ffff80">and, oh, so handsome.</font>

109
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,361
<font color="#ffff80">Ugh. Mother.
Come on!</font>

110
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:22,089
<font color="#ffff80">Never forget how much
he loved you, Kubo.</font>

111
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,891
<font color="#ffff80">He died protecting us.</font>

112
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,970
<font color="#ffff80">Did the Moon King...
Uh.</font>

113
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,405
<font color="#ffff80">Your grandfather.</font>

114
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,049
<font color="#ffff80">Did Grandfather and your
sisters really kill my father?</font>

115
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,884
<font color="#ffff80">It can't be true, can it?</font>

116
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,086
<font color="#ffff80">They're family.</font>

117
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,049
<font color="#ffff80">No, they are monsters.</font>

118
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,408
<font color="#ffff80">Grandfather and my sisters
stole your eye, Kubo.</font>

119
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,324
<font color="#ffff80">They must never
find you again. Never!</font>

120
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,722
<font color="#ffff80">You must always stay hidden
from the night sky,</font>

121
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,961
<font color="#ffff80">or they will find you</font>

122
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,883
<font color="#ffff80">and they'll take
you away from me.</font>

123
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,169
<font color="#ffff80">Promise me you will
never let this happen.</font>

124
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,049
<font color="#ffff80">Promise me, Kubo!</font>

125
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,730
<font color="#ffff80">Don't be sad, Kubo.</font>

126
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,808
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo?</font>

127
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,770
<font color="#ffff80">Remember what you must do,
Kubo?</font>

128
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,527
<font color="#ffff80">Remember?</font>

129
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,371
<font color="#ffff80">Keep you with me
at all times, Mr. Monkey.</font>

130
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,441
<font color="#ffff80">And?</font>

131
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,804
<font color="#ffff80">And keep Father's robe
on my back at all times.</font>

132
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,006
<font color="#ffff80">Yes, Kubo.</font>

133
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,130
<font color="#ffff80">And there's
one more thing.</font>

134
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:30,521
<font color="#ffff80">Never, ever
stay out after dark.</font>

135
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,561
<font color="#ffff80">Huh?</font>

136
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,887
<font color="#ffff80">Remember?</font>

137
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,286
<font color="#ffff80">Yes, Mr. Monkey.
Good boy.</font>

138
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,166
<font color="#ffff80">Bedtime.</font>

139
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,371
<font color="#ffff80">Mother, wake up.
You're dreaming.</font>

140
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,602
<font color="#ffff80">No. Kubo.</font>

141
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,205
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo, is that you?</font>

142
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,964
<font color="#ffff80">Yes, Mother. I'm here.</font>

143
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,170
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo, what happened
to your eye?</font>

144
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,130
<font color="#ffff80">Paper boy!</font>

145
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,840
<font color="#ffff80">Here, here!</font>

146
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,045
<font color="#ffff80">Come on. Come on.</font>

147
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,323
<font color="#ffff80">Come sit next to me.
I got us a good spot here.</font>

148
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,125
<font color="#ffff80">What do you think?</font>

149
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,170
<font color="#ffff80">I got myself all spruced
up for the big day.</font>

150
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,567
<font color="#ffff80">Mmm.</font>

151
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,086
<font color="#ffff80">I do so love the festival.</font>

152
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,640
<font color="#ffff80">A time to celebrate.</font>

153
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,402
<font color="#ffff80">You know, it's a shame
you never stay past sundown.</font>

154
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,484
<font color="#ffff80">There's fireworks,
and singing, and dancing,</font>

155
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,127
<font color="#ffff80">and feasting, of course.</font>

156
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,362
<font color="#ffff80">But the best part of all...</font>

157
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,881
<font color="#ffff80">Do you see those
lamps and altars?</font>

158
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,171
<font color="#ffff80">We use those to speak to the
loved ones that left us behind.</font>

159
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,648
<font color="#ffff80">We listen to their tales,</font>

160
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,805
<font color="#ffff80">and guide their safe return
to the blissful pure land.</font>

161
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,928
<font color="#ffff80">Really?
Did you speak to someone?</font>

162
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,769
<font color="#ffff80">Yes, I did. My husband.</font>

163
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,084
<font color="#ffff80">His voice was
as clear and loud</font>

164
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,925
<font color="#ffff80">as the one you use
for your stories.</font>

165
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,367
<font color="#ffff80">In 72 years, he never
had a thing to say.</font>

166
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,046
<font color="#ffff80">Now he's gone,
I can't shut him up.</font>

167
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,962
<font color="#ffff80">You have someone
you wanna talk to, huh?</font>

168
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,087
<font color="#ffff80">Very much.</font>

169
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,730
<font color="#ffff80">Well,
what's stopping you?</font>

170
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,211
<font color="#ffff80">Don't I need a lamp?</font>

171
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,763
<font color="#ffff80">Well, I'll bet you could
make a really nice one</font>

172
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,322
<font color="#ffff80">with that paper
folding thing you do.</font>

173
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,041
<font color="#ffff80">You see,</font>

174
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,807
<font color="#ffff80">not just a pretty face, huh?</font>

175
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,927
<font color="#ffff80">Now, hurry along.</font>

176
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,171
<font color="#ffff80">Go! There's still
time before dark.</font>

177
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,890
<font color="#ffff80">Go! Get out of here.</font>

178
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,447
<font color="#ffff80">Place the lamp
at the altar.</font>

179
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,404
<font color="#ffff80">Very good.</font>

180
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,084
<font color="#ffff80">What do we
do next, Daddy?</font>

181
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,764
<font color="#ffff80">Now we pray.</font>

182
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,208
<font color="#ffff80">We ask her spirit
to honor us with its light.</font>

183
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,884
<font color="#ffff80">Grandma, will you
please honor...</font>

184
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,246
<font color="#ffff80">Shh.</font>

185
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,963
<font color="#ffff80">Softly, softly.</font>

186
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,124
<font color="#ffff80">Hello, Father.
I hope you're well.</font>

187
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,050
<font color="#ffff80">I mean, I know you're dead,</font>

188
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,522
<font color="#ffff80">but I hope
everything is okay.</font>

189
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,324
<font color="#ffff80">Look, it's your robe.</font>

190
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,044
<font color="#ffff80">Mother says
I'll grow into it.</font>

191
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,730
<font color="#ffff80">She says you were
a great leader</font>

192
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,922
<font color="#ffff80">who died protecting me.</font>

193
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,446
<font color="#ffff80">Saving one of my eyes.</font>

194
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,524
<font color="#ffff80">Two would have been ideal,
but thanks anyway.</font>

195
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,644
<font color="#ffff80">Father, I'm worried
about Mother.</font>

196
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,088
<font color="#ffff80">With every day that goes by,
she drifts further away.</font>

197
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,247
<font color="#ffff80">She talks a lot
about you, but...</font>

198
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,442
<font color="#ffff80">But I just don't know.</font>

199
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,251
<font color="#ffff80">I don't think she remembers
what's real anymore.</font>

200
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,687
<font color="#ffff80">I don't know
what's real anymore.</font>

201
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,126
<font color="#ffff80">I just wish you were here,</font>

202
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,683
<font color="#ffff80">so I could talk
to you, see you,</font>

203
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,205
<font color="#ffff80">find out what I should do.</font>

204
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,886
<font color="#ffff80">Daddy, Daddy, she's here!
Grandma is here!</font>

205
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,645
<font color="#ffff80">Now it's time
for the final part.</font>

206
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,445
<font color="#ffff80">We have to help her
get back to the spirit world.</font>

207
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,205
<font color="#ffff80">But she just got here.</font>

208
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,522
<font color="#ffff80">Come on.</font>

209
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,931
<font color="#ffff80">Father? Hello?</font>

210
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,051
<font color="#ffff80">Anytime.</font>

211
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,725
<font color="#ffff80">Fine!</font>

212
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,123
<font color="#ffff80">I don't need you anyway.</font>

213
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,003
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo.</font>

214
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,246
<font color="#ffff80">I'm sorry.</font>

215
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,327
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo.</font>

216
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,726
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo.</font>

217
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,331
<font color="#ffff80">Little boy.</font>

218
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,562
<font color="#ffff80">What happened to your eye?</font>

219
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,928
<font color="#ffff80">Who are you?
How do you know my name?</font>

220
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,321
<font color="#ffff80">We are your family, Kubo.</font>

221
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,880
<font color="#ffff80">Your mother's sisters.</font>

222
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,885
<font color="#ffff80">And we've been looking
for you for so long.</font>

223
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,842
<font color="#ffff80">It's so lovely
to meet you, Kubo.</font>

224
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,603
<font color="#ffff80">Face-to-face.</font>

225
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,406
<font color="#ffff80">Come, Kubo.
Come to your aunties.</font>

226
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,601
<font color="#ffff80">No reason to be afraid, Kubo.</font>

227
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,682
<font color="#ffff80">We just need
your other eye.</font>

228
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,124
<font color="#ffff80">Your grandfather
admires it so.</font>

229
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,561
<font color="#ffff80">Help! Help!</font>

230
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,650
<font color="#ffff80">Somebody help!</font>

231
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,643
<font color="#ffff80">Help! Look out!</font>

232
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,570
<font color="#ffff80">Run!</font>

233
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,685
<font color="#ffff80">We're here, Kubo.</font>

234
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,001
<font color="#ffff80">Your family has
come for you.</font>

235
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,881
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo.</font>

236
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,521
<font color="#ffff80">Mother.</font>

237
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,760
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo, you must find the armor.
It's your only chance.</font>

238
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,200
<font color="#ffff80">Remember this.</font>

239
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,168
<font color="#ffff80">Mother! Mother! No!</font>

240
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,601
<font color="#ffff80">Mother!</font>

241
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,811
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo.</font>

242
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,481
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo!</font>

243
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,960
<font color="#ffff80">Can you hear me, Kubo?</font>

244
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,801
<font color="#ffff80">I said your mother
is gone.</font>

245
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,850
<font color="#ffff80">Your village is destroyed.
Burned to the ground.</font>

246
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,002
<font color="#ffff80">We landed here
in the Far Lands.</font>

247
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,930
<font color="#ffff80">Your enemies
aren't far behind.</font>

248
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,002
<font color="#ffff80">We must search for shelter
before your grandfather comes.</font>

249
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,042
<font color="#ffff80">We need to go now.</font>

250
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,002
<font color="#ffff80">Come on,
get up, let's go.</font>

251
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,690
<font color="#ffff80">Once we're inside,</font>

252
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,162
<font color="#ffff80">you might be tempted
to complain about the odor.</font>

253
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,647
<font color="#ffff80">Keep in mind
my sense of smell</font>

254
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,405
<font color="#ffff80">is 10 times
stronger than yours.</font>

255
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,009
<font color="#ffff80">You have questions,
I can tell.</font>

256
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,965
<font color="#ffff80">Who...
You get three.</font>

257
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,569
<font color="#ffff80">I think I have more.</font>

258
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,247
<font color="#ffff80">Three, but first
you're gonna eat.</font>

259
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,250
<font color="#ffff80">Why only three?</font>

260
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,561
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, that was your first question.
What?</font>

261
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,051
<font color="#ffff80">I don't understand
what's happening!</font>

262
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,971
<font color="#ffff80">Who are you?</font>

263
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,724
<font color="#ffff80">You don't recognize me?</font>

264
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,325
<font color="#ffff80">All these years, you had
to keep me in your pack.</font>

265
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,646
<font color="#ffff80">Well, now you know why.</font>

266
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,722
<font color="#ffff80">But you were a wooden charm.</font>

267
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,610
<font color="#ffff80">You were this big.</font>

268
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,763
<font color="#ffff80">I called that charm
"Mr. Monkey."</font>

269
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,166
<font color="#ffff80">And if I were
alive at that point,</font>

270
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,730
<font color="#ffff80">I might have
found that insulting.</font>

271
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,566
<font color="#ffff80">Look, your mother used the
last of her magic to save you</font>

272
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,210
<font color="#ffff80">and bring me to life.</font>

273
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,605
<font color="#ffff80">Here. Drink.</font>

274
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,164
<font color="#ffff80">It smells.
Everything in here smells.</font>

275
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,571
<font color="#ffff80">Drink it.
I don't want it.</font>

276
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,847
<font color="#ffff80">I said drink it.</font>

277
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,764
<font color="#ffff80">You're a mean monkey,
aren't you?</font>

278
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,320
<font color="#ffff80">Yes. Yes, I am.
And that's three.</font>

279
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,323
<font color="#ffff80">You're out of questions now,
so just listen.</font>

280
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,329
<font color="#ffff80">I'm here
to protect you, Kubo.</font>

281
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,767
<font color="#ffff80">And that means
you have to do as I say.</font>

282
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,207
<font color="#ffff80">So, if you don't eat,
you'll be weak.</font>

283
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,884
<font color="#ffff80">If you're weak,
you'll be slow.</font>

284
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,644
<font color="#ffff80">If you're slow, you'll die.</font>

285
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,531
<font color="#ffff80">It's too hot!</font>

286
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,921
<font color="#ffff80">Drink.</font>

287
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,970
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, excuse me.</font>

288
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,091
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, you better start
taking this seriously, Kubo.</font>

289
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,606
<font color="#ffff80">This is real.
This is not a story.</font>

290
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,646
<font color="#ffff80">Those things, your aunts,
they never get hungry.</font>

291
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,846
<font color="#ffff80">They never sleep.</font>

292
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,410
<font color="#ffff80">They will find you!</font>

293
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,927
<font color="#ffff80">And if we're not prepared,</font>

294
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,243
<font color="#ffff80">they'll kill me
and take your other eye.</font>

295
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,606
<font color="#ffff80">What are we gonna do?</font>

296
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,287
<font color="#ffff80">We're going to
find the armor.</font>

297
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,727
<font color="#ffff80">It's the only thing
that can protect you.</font>

298
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,083
<font color="#ffff80">So it's real. Really real.</font>

299
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,007
<font color="#ffff80">Don't worry.
I'm not going to keep it.</font>

300
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,689
<font color="#ffff80">I pulled that
from her head.</font>

301
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,721
<font color="#ffff80">I didn't mean to.</font>

302
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,560
<font color="#ffff80">Your mother
was very powerful.</font>

303
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,005
<font color="#ffff80">She blessed your robes</font>

304
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,528
<font color="#ffff80">so that when the need was most,
they would fly you away.</font>

305
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,803
<font color="#ffff80">She used the last of that
power to bring me to life.</font>

306
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,482
<font color="#ffff80">This bracelet,
her hair, it's a memory.</font>

307
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,086
<font color="#ffff80">And memories are
powerful things, Kubo.</font>

308
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,766
<font color="#ffff80">Never lose it.</font>

309
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,961
<font color="#ffff80">One more question?</font>

310
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,961
<font color="#ffff80">Last one.</font>

311
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,485
<font color="#ffff80">Do you know where it is?</font>

312
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,166
<font color="#ffff80">The armor?</font>

313
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,326
<font color="#ffff80">No. No, I don't.</font>

314
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,649
<font color="#ffff80">Now, go to sleep.</font>

315
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,490
<font color="#ffff80">Goodnight, Monkey.</font>

316
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,201
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo.</font>

317
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,125
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo.</font>

318
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,929
<font color="#ffff80">You were
talking in your sleep.</font>

319
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,131
<font color="#ffff80">You were dreaming,
calling out to your father,</font>

320
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,171
<font color="#ffff80">and then the paper flew out of
your bag and folded itself into</font>

321
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,241
<font color="#ffff80">him.</font>

322
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,040
<font color="#ffff80">He's been standing there for
hours, quietly judging us.</font>

323
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,965
<font color="#ffff80">I'm not even convinced
this counts as origami.</font>

324
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,046
<font color="#ffff80">I could swear
scissors were involved.</font>

325
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,721
<font color="#ffff80">Ow.</font>

326
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,286
<font color="#ffff80">Back home in the cave,
my mother's dreams did this,</font>

327
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,001
<font color="#ffff80">and the paper always
unfolded itself by morning.</font>

328
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,690
<font color="#ffff80">What's that about?</font>

329
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,645
<font color="#ffff80">What are you doing?</font>

330
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,323
<font color="#ffff80">I guess this is how my
father answered me. Hmm.</font>

331
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,927
<font color="#ffff80">I'm tempted to say
that entrusting our fate</font>

332
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,447
<font color="#ffff80">to the guidance
of a small paper man</font>

333
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,965
<font color="#ffff80">seems like a bad idea.</font>

334
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,564
<font color="#ffff80">But it's the best
bad idea we have.</font>

335
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,410
<font color="#ffff80">You're growing stronger.</font>

336
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,887
<font color="#ffff80">You might not wanna look
quite so pleased about that.</font>

337
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,047
<font color="#ffff80">We grow stronger, the world
grows more dangerous.</font>

338
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,488
<font color="#ffff80">Life has a funny way
of keeping things balanced.</font>

339
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,002
<font color="#ffff80">Monkey, do you ever say
anything encouraging?</font>

340
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,362
<font color="#ffff80">I encourage you not to die.</font>

341
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,402
<font color="#ffff80">"I encourage you not to die."</font>

342
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,131
<font color="#ffff80">Mosquitoes. Annoying.</font>

343
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,170
<font color="#ffff80">Wasn't me, I swear.</font>

344
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,085
<font color="#ffff80">Paper runs out,
as does patience.</font>

345
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,730
<font color="#ffff80">I didn't ask them
to do that.</font>

346
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,965
<font color="#ffff80">The second time.</font>

347
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,486
<font color="#ffff80">I didn't!
At least, not exactly.</font>

348
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,164
<font color="#ffff80">I mean, I felt it, but...</font>

349
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,208
<font color="#ffff80">Magic is not
meant to be easy.</font>

350
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,964
<font color="#ffff80">You need to
learn control.</font>

351
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,647
<font color="#ffff80">Concentrate on what you're
doing, and always remember,</font>

352
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,121
<font color="#ffff80">don't mess with the monkey.</font>

353
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,770
<font color="#ffff80">Tread carefully, Kubo. This
isn't one of your stories.</font>

354
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,323
<font color="#ffff80">How do you know?
Maybe it is.</font>

355
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,927
<font color="#ffff80">And I'm the valiant hero
and you're the mean monkey.</font>

356
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,411
<font color="#ffff80">Heroes come and go.</font>

357
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,768
<font color="#ffff80">Any moment, something terrible
could come out of nowhere and...</font>

358
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,040
<font color="#ffff80">Monkey!</font>

359
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,406
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo!</font>

360
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,810
<font color="#ffff80">Monkey, wait.</font>

361
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,848
<font color="#ffff80">He wasn't trying to hurt me.</font>

362
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,051
<font color="#ffff80">He just wanted...</font>

363
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,525
<font color="#ffff80">Hanzo.
Hanzo?</font>

364
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,281
<font color="#ffff80">Hanzo.</font>

365
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,210
<font color="#ffff80">I still think
I'm gonna stab him.</font>

366
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,521
<font color="#ffff80">Why must you always
assume the worst?</font>

367
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,082
<font color="#ffff80">Oh! Oh! Pardon me for not trusting
this giant, spiky, insect-monster</font>

368
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,286
<font color="#ffff80">that just kidnapped you.</font>

369
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,125
<font color="#ffff80">Hanzo. Yes,
I remember him.</font>

370
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,771
<font color="#ffff80">I think, maybe,
he was my master.</font>

371
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,725
<font color="#ffff80">What?
What did you say?</font>

372
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,445
<font color="#ffff80">We had a crest.
A samurai crest.</font>

373
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,242
<font color="#ffff80">Have you seen
this crest before?</font>

374
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,285
<font color="#ffff80">This is a miracle.</font>

375
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,010
<font color="#ffff80">You have our robes.</font>

376
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,924
<font color="#ffff80">You're wearing our robes!</font>

377
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,204
<font color="#ffff80">Why are you
wearing our robes?</font>

378
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,645
<font color="#ffff80">He doesn't have to
answer your questions.</font>

379
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,085
<font color="#ffff80">Anyway, who are you?</font>

380
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,521
<font color="#ffff80">Many years ago,
I was cursed.</font>

381
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,925
<font color="#ffff80">Trapped in this
cursed state.</font>

382
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,845
<font color="#ffff80">Cursed to wander
the Far Lands.</font>

383
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,287
<font color="#ffff80">Cursed or curs-ed.</font>

384
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,771
<font color="#ffff80">No comrades, no master.</font>

385
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,411
<font color="#ffff80">Not even a name
or a single memory</font>

386
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,725
<font color="#ffff80">of the noble warrior
I once was.</font>

387
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,962
<font color="#ffff80">You used to be a man?</font>

388
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,610
<font color="#ffff80">No, not just any man.</font>

389
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,125
<font color="#ffff80">A samurai.</font>

390
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,762
<font color="#ffff80">I mean,
I'm pretty certain.</font>

391
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,520
<font color="#ffff80">Look, I had the stuff.</font>

392
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,046
<font color="#ffff80">I mean, I'm either a samurai
or a really bad hoarder.</font>

393
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,205
<font color="#ffff80">Either way, inside my thorax
beats the heart of a warrior.</font>

394
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:28,286
<font color="#ffff80">If you have no memory, how can
you be certain of anything?</font>

395
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,489
<font color="#ffff80">Because I get flashes.</font>

396
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:35,129
<font color="#ffff80">They come about from objects
I find on my travels.</font>

397
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,530
<font color="#ffff80">Sometimes it's a sound.</font>

398
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,285
<font color="#ffff80">Or a smell.</font>

399
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,404
<font color="#ffff80">You must get
a lot of flashes.</font>

400
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,369
<font color="#ffff80">The memories, they fade.</font>

401
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,329
<font color="#ffff80">And all I'm left with
is the sense that I was</font>

402
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,611
<font color="#ffff80">once part of
something much greater.</font>

403
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,485
<font color="#ffff80">Monkey, can I tell him?</font>

404
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,005
<font color="#ffff80">I really don't think
that's a good idea.</font>

405
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,969
<font color="#ffff80">He has a right.
Absolutely not.</font>

406
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,684
<font color="#ffff80">But... I...
No "buts." No!</font>

407
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,728
<font color="#ffff80">What? Tell me what?
Hanzo was my father.</font>

408
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,484
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo!</font>

409
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,806
<font color="#ffff80">This is a miracle.</font>

410
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,804
<font color="#ffff80">I have found
the son of my master.</font>

411
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,043
<font color="#ffff80">Don't even.
Oh.</font>

412
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,283
<font color="#ffff80">Whatever brings you to these
lands, whatever your quest,</font>

413
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,442
<font color="#ffff80">it is now my quest, too.</font>

414
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,129
<font color="#ffff80">I will join you, and I will give
my life for you, if necessary.</font>

415
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,929
<font color="#ffff80">Wow. You will?</font>

416
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,211
<font color="#ffff80">What? Do you think
that's possible?</font>

417
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,602
<font color="#ffff80">Look, kid, I mean, I know how these
quests go. People die all the time.</font>

418
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,160
<font color="#ffff80">They drop like flies.
That doesn't matter.</font>

419
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,810
<font color="#ffff80">'Cause I have a feeling</font>

420
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,565
<font color="#ffff80">this is my destiny.</font>

421
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,085
<font color="#ffff80">No, it isn't!</font>

422
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,969
<font color="#ffff80">We can't trust
anything you say,</font>

423
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,560
<font color="#ffff80">because you can't
trust anything you say.</font>

424
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,160
<font color="#ffff80">We don't know anything about you.</font>

425
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,047
<font color="#ffff80">Monkey,
you said it yourself.</font>

426
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,441
<font color="#ffff80">Our quest
is a difficult one.</font>

427
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,606
<font color="#ffff80">A samurai, even a cursed one with
no memory, that looks like a bug,</font>

428
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,881
<font color="#ffff80">could be helpful.</font>

429
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,770
<font color="#ffff80">Yes, I am certain
I could be helpful.</font>

430
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,807
<font color="#ffff80">Indispensable.</font>

431
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,564
<font color="#ffff80">In what way?</font>

432
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,322
<font color="#ffff80">Firing an arrow into a wall
is hardly what I call...</font>

433
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,921
<font color="#ffff80">Impressive.</font>

434
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,967
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, look at that.</font>

435
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,650
<font color="#ffff80">Literally, the first
time I've ever done it.</font>

436
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,404
<font color="#ffff80">Just tell me of our quest,</font>

437
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,764
<font color="#ffff80">and I will quickly demonstrate
my numerous indispensabilities.</font>

438
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,720
<font color="#ffff80">Well, that's kind of
a long story.</font>

439
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,641
<font color="#ffff80">You've got my attention.
I promise I won't even blink.</font>

440
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,649
<font color="#ffff80">I actually don't think
I even can blink.</font>

441
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,330
<font color="#ffff80">- Do I have eyelids?
- Fine.</font>

442
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,801
<font color="#ffff80">Walk and talk.
Hanzo has found a path.</font>

443
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,091
<font color="#ffff80">So, you used
to be a toy monkey.</font>

444
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,482
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo, I really don't see how
this part is important to our story.</font>

445
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:11,571
<font color="#ffff80">I kept her in my pocket. She was only
like this big.</font>

446
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,880
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, Kubo, that's enough. Tiny.</font>

447
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,689
<font color="#ffff80">And she was called
"Mr. Monkey."</font>

448
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,485
<font color="#ffff80">I wasn't a toy.
I was a charm.</font>

449
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,801
<font color="#ffff80">Of course you were.</font>

450
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,006
<font color="#ffff80">That doesn't look good.</font>

451
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,810
<font color="#ffff80">Don't touch anything.</font>

452
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,606
<font color="#ffff80">He did it.</font>

453
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,561
<font color="#ffff80">Okay.</font>

454
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,040
<font color="#ffff80">No. No. No.</font>

455
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,887
<font color="#ffff80">Yes.</font>

456
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,804
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo, look.</font>

457
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,723
<font color="#ffff80">The sword unbreakable.</font>

458
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,607
<font color="#ffff80">It could be a trap.</font>

459
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,569
<font color="#ffff80">Allow me.</font>

460
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,041
<font color="#ffff80">What, it's not a trap
if you do it?</font>

461
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,646
<font color="#ffff80">Stealth is my middle name.</font>

462
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,484
<font color="#ffff80">You don't even
have a first name.</font>

463
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,369
<font color="#ffff80">Don't worry. I got this.</font>

464
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,325
<font color="#ffff80">The mighty
Beetle is victorious!</font>

465
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,401
<font color="#ffff80">I don't got this.</font>

466
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,481
<font color="#ffff80">I don't got this!</font>

467
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,050
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, for crying out loud!</font>

468
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,284
<font color="#ffff80">I invoke
the sword unbreakable!</font>

469
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,726
<font color="#ffff80">It broke.</font>

470
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,770
<font color="#ffff80">So, does it just
mean the handle or...</font>

471
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,487
<font color="#ffff80">I'm a little disappointed
with this magic sword.</font>

472
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,767
<font color="#ffff80">It's not the right sword,
you idiot!</font>

473
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,481
<font color="#ffff80">Look!</font>

474
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,120
<font color="#ffff80">The sword!
It's in his head.</font>

475
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,649
<font color="#ffff80">Hey! I've got
a bone to pick with you.</font>

476
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,724
<font color="#ffff80">See, because
he's made of bones.</font>

477
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,290
<font color="#ffff80">You're an embarrassment.</font>

478
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,967
<font color="#ffff80">Uh...</font>

479
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,725
<font color="#ffff80">This is problematic.</font>

480
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,485
<font color="#ffff80">Enough with the arrows!</font>

481
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,281
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, foot!</font>

482
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,407
<font color="#ffff80">You can fly?</font>

483
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,050
<font color="#ffff80">Apparently, yes!</font>

484
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,646
<font color="#ffff80">Are you sure it isn't
the sword unfindable?</font>

485
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,681
<font color="#ffff80">I think I found it!</font>

486
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,366
<font color="#ffff80">A hand here. Anyone?</font>

487
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,605
<font color="#ffff80">Anyone else?</font>

488
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,966
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo!</font>

489
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,881
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo!
Monkey!</font>

490
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,361
<font color="#ffff80">Whoa!</font>

491
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,606
<font color="#ffff80">No!
Kubo!</font>

492
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,206
<font color="#ffff80">Huh.</font>

493
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:37,841
<font color="#ffff80">Yes!</font>

494
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,365
<font color="#ffff80">Thank goodness that's over.</font>

495
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:01,167
<font color="#ffff80">Everything turning black.</font>

496
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,083
<font color="#ffff80">Then open your eyes.</font>

497
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,481
<font color="#ffff80">Oh.</font>

498
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,120
<font color="#ffff80">I can't feel my wings.</font>

499
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,601
<font color="#ffff80">You didn't even know you
had them five minutes ago.</font>

500
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,841
<font color="#ffff80">Stop wriggling.</font>

501
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:11,921
<font color="#ffff80">Here.</font>

502
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,087
<font color="#ffff80">Is that feeling better?</font>

503
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,645
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, yeah.
A little to the left.</font>

504
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,201
<font color="#ffff80">Down, just a bit.</font>

505
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,284
<font color="#ffff80">Right there. That's good.</font>

506
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,362
<font color="#ffff80">Wait, you're being
nice to me.</font>

507
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,044
<font color="#ffff80">Shh. Don't tell anyone.</font>

508
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,246
<font color="#ffff80">We did it, Beetle.</font>

509
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,766
<font color="#ffff80">We got the sword.</font>

510
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,928
<font color="#ffff80">Whoa. Put that down,
it's sharp!</font>

511
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,250
<font color="#ffff80">Ooh. Mmm.</font>

512
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:47,245
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, we're done here.
Get up.</font>

513
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,725
<font color="#ffff80">We have a lot
of walking to do.</font>

514
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,961
<font color="#ffff80">You can't be serious.</font>

515
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,084
<font color="#ffff80">I'm always serious.</font>

516
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,921
<font color="#ffff80">Are you two going
to fight, again?</font>

517
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,480
<font color="#ffff80">Of course not. We're having
a grown-up conversation.</font>

518
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,686
<font color="#ffff80">You're going to
fight again.</font>

519
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,047
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo, just go over there
and play with something.</font>

520
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,724
<font color="#ffff80">Not that!</font>

521
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,168
<font color="#ffff80">Monkey, this is
the Long Lake.</font>

522
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,402
<font color="#ffff80">We can't walk around it.</font>

523
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,686
<font color="#ffff80">We need to swim across.</font>

524
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,884
<font color="#ffff80">I can carry Kubo.</font>

525
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,486
<font color="#ffff80">"Carry Kubo."
That's your better idea?</font>

526
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,961
<font color="#ffff80">Look, I appreciate
your help. I really do.</font>

527
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,644
<font color="#ffff80">But when it comes
to the boy,</font>

528
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,051
<font color="#ffff80">I know what's best.
Oh, is that right?</font>

529
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,966
<font color="#ffff80">And what's best is not to be fielding
ideas from a talking cockroach.</font>

530
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,724
<font color="#ffff80">This coming from
a talking monkey.</font>

531
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,484
<font color="#ffff80">I can still
hear you, you know.</font>

532
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,244
<font color="#ffff80">Then play louder.</font>

533
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,966
<font color="#ffff80">This conversation is over. Monkeys
don't swim.</font>

534
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,805
<font color="#ffff80">- Not to worry. Monkey see, monkey do.
- Oh.</font>

535
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,530
<font color="#ffff80">How long have you
been waiting to say that?</font>

536
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,125
<font color="#ffff80">Ever since
I met you.</font>

537
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,408
<font color="#ffff80">Hey, what were we grown-up
conversation-ing about? Oh!</font>

538
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,531
<font color="#ffff80">You're ridiculous. You're
just absolutely ridiculous.</font>

539
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,601
<font color="#ffff80">Ridiculous!</font>

540
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,889
<font color="#ffff80">Crossing the lake
is a ridiculous idea.</font>

541
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:51,203
<font color="#ffff80">It's not your fault. There's
no sense left in your head.</font>

542
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,406
<font color="#ffff80">I think I resent that.</font>

543
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,522
<font color="#ffff80">I may not know everything...</font>

544
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,045
<font color="#ffff80">Anything.
Anything.</font>

545
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:59,203
<font color="#ffff80">But I do know Kubo is more
capable than you think he is.</font>

546
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,329
<font color="#ffff80">You're being a tiny
bit overprotective here.</font>

547
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,164
<font color="#ffff80">I'm being a lot
overprotective here.</font>

548
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,881
<font color="#ffff80">It's my job to make sure Kubo
is safe, and that is not safe.</font>

549
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,042
<font color="#ffff80">You... You are not safe.</font>

550
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,849
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo is just a child.</font>

551
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,764
<font color="#ffff80">And an incredibly gifted one.
He just saved our lives.</font>

552
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:20,210
<font color="#ffff80">Yes, he's very powerful, but
he still has much to learn!</font>

553
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,691
<font color="#ffff80">What?</font>

554
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,610
<font color="#ffff80">Well,
fast learner.</font>

555
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,124
<font color="#ffff80">Did you know
you could do that?</font>

556
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,440
<font color="#ffff80">Show off.</font>

557
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:08,164
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, now take
a deep breath.</font>

558
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,082
<font color="#ffff80">Clear your mind.</font>

559
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,242
<font color="#ffff80">Guess I got that part covered.</font>

560
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:18,211
<font color="#ffff80">Now, draw back slowly.
That's it.</font>

561
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,807
<font color="#ffff80">Close one eye. Guess you
got that part covered.</font>

562
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,648
<font color="#ffff80">Concentrate on what is
directly in front of you.</font>

563
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,200
<font color="#ffff80">Let everything else
fall away.</font>

564
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,329
<font color="#ffff80">And release!</font>

565
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,724
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah!</font>

566
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,201
<font color="#ffff80">Perfect shot!</font>

567
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,560
<font color="#ffff80">Not bad.</font>

568
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,847
<font color="#ffff80">And what's your plan for getting
the fish into the boat,</font>

569
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,365
<font color="#ffff80">so we can actually eat it?</font>

570
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,050
<font color="#ffff80">Well, I said I was teaching
him how to shoot, not fish.</font>

571
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,521
<font color="#ffff80">Fishing is
tomorrow's lesson.</font>

572
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,291
<font color="#ffff80">Give me that.
Whoa.</font>

573
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,886
<font color="#ffff80">Grabby monkey.</font>

574
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,286
<font color="#ffff80">Now try it.</font>

575
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,201
<font color="#ffff80">Pull back and...</font>

576
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,041
<font color="#ffff80">Whoo-hoo!</font>

577
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,325
<font color="#ffff80">A rope.</font>

578
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,640
<font color="#ffff80">It's a pretty good idea.</font>

579
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,927
<font color="#ffff80">Hmm. And you're not
an awful shot.</font>

580
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,481
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, now you two
are being weird.</font>

581
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,600
<font color="#ffff80">Um...</font>

582
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,160
<font color="#ffff80">We're going to need
something to cut this with.</font>

583
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,404
<font color="#ffff80">Sword unbreakable.</font>

584
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,448
<font color="#ffff80">Must you play
with your food?</font>

585
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,280
<font color="#ffff80">Yes.</font>

586
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,806
<font color="#ffff80">What's the matter, Kubo?</font>

587
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,407
<font color="#ffff80">You act like you've
never had a meal</font>

588
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,687
<font color="#ffff80">sitting between a monkey
and a beetle before.</font>

589
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,009
<font color="#ffff80">I've never had a meal sitting
between anyone before.</font>

590
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,481
<font color="#ffff80">Come on, eat.
You need energy.</font>

591
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,608
<font color="#ffff80">And this is much better
than whale soup.</font>

592
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:23,126
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo, question.</font>

593
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,764
<font color="#ffff80">Before you started on your heroic
quest, what were you like?</font>

594
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:32,242
<font color="#ffff80">Well, I looked
after my mother mostly.</font>

595
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,368
<font color="#ffff80">And I told stories</font>

596
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,767
<font color="#ffff80">about mighty
warriors seeking revenge</font>

597
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,208
<font color="#ffff80">with battles, and
monsters, and magic.</font>

598
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,163
<font color="#ffff80">I was pretty good
at telling them.</font>

599
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,645
<font color="#ffff80">Not so good
at ending them.</font>

600
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,411
<font color="#ffff80">Sometimes I would tell my mother
stories about little things.</font>

601
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:52,245
<font color="#ffff80">Like skimming
rocks across the river</font>

602
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,563
<font color="#ffff80">or catching fireflies
in the mulberry fields.</font>

603
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,244
<font color="#ffff80">And when I told
those stories,</font>

604
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,766
<font color="#ffff80">I could see her eyes
were mostly clear.</font>

605
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,049
<font color="#ffff80">I could tell she saw me.</font>

606
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,289
<font color="#ffff80">Really saw me.</font>

607
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,884
<font color="#ffff80">I could see her, too.</font>

608
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,371
<font color="#ffff80">Her real self.</font>

609
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:12,240
<font color="#ffff80">Her spirit trying
to fight its way out.</font>

610
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,091
<font color="#ffff80">It was beautiful.</font>

611
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,171
<font color="#ffff80">You know something, Kubo?</font>

612
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,762
<font color="#ffff80">Back when you
just told stories,</font>

613
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,241
<font color="#ffff80">before you went on
this great adventure,</font>

614
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,847
<font color="#ffff80">you were still
very much a hero.</font>

615
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,690
<font color="#ffff80">We're gonna have
to head for shore.</font>

616
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,808
<font color="#ffff80">Find a hiding place and...</font>

617
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,724
<font color="#ffff80">The second piece
of armor.</font>

618
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,040
<font color="#ffff80">The breastplate.</font>

619
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,168
<font color="#ffff80">It's down there?</font>

620
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,520
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, I got it.</font>

621
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,602
<font color="#ffff80">Beetle, wait!
No, don't worry.</font>

622
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,321
<font color="#ffff80">Beetles can hold their breath
under water for a very long time.</font>

623
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,481
<font color="#ffff80">What? Since when?</font>

624
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,164
<font color="#ffff80">It's a well-known fact,
Monkey.</font>

625
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,811
<font color="#ffff80">So, you don't remember anything
at all, but beetles swimming?</font>

626
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,325
<font color="#ffff80">That's what
sticks in there?</font>

627
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,367
<font color="#ffff80">No, Beetle.</font>

628
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,330
<font color="#ffff80">My mother told me
a story about the Long Lake.</font>

629
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,164
<font color="#ffff80">There's something
under the water.</font>

630
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,241
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, yeah?</font>

631
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,845
<font color="#ffff80">Um...</font>

632
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,003
<font color="#ffff80">What kind of something?</font>

633
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,162
<font color="#ffff80">She said there was
a garden of eyes,</font>

634
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:36,687
<font color="#ffff80">eyes that stare into you,
into your soul.</font>

635
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,924
<font color="#ffff80">They show you secrets, things to
keep you down there with them.</font>

636
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,647
<font color="#ffff80">Forever.</font>

637
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,885
<font color="#ffff80">Okay.</font>

638
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,244
<font color="#ffff80">Well, I won't look
directly into anyone's eyes,</font>

639
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,607
<font color="#ffff80">even if I'm being
incredibly sincere.</font>

640
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,526
<font color="#ffff80">You're gonna miss me, Monkey.</font>

641
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,481
<font color="#ffff80">Be careful.</font>

642
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:35,844
<font color="#ffff80">He's searching for the armor
just like his insolent father.</font>

643
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,649
<font color="#ffff80">Yes, sister.</font>

644
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:42,169
<font color="#ffff80">Then we must ensure he does
not find what remains.</font>

645
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,802
<font color="#ffff80">Monkey,
I think he's in trouble!</font>

646
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,686
<font color="#ffff80">We should help him.</font>

647
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,764
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo, your aunts are still out there.
I'm sorry.</font>

648
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,002
<font color="#ffff80">But we have to head for shore.</font>

649
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,121
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo!</font>

650
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,521
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo.</font>

651
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,285
<font color="#ffff80">Look at this.</font>

652
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:21,282
<font color="#ffff80">I come fishing and all I
reel in is a stinking ape.</font>

653
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,083
<font color="#ffff80">How pathetic that
this filthy creature</font>

654
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,481
<font color="#ffff80">is all that's left
of my sister's magic.</font>

655
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:31,162
<font color="#ffff80">This filthy creature
will tear you apart!</font>

656
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,050
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Kubo.</i></font>

657
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,081
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo?</font>

658
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,729
<font color="#ffff80">I have crushed creatures who could
fit this world on their fingernail.</font>

659
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,402
<font color="#ffff80">This victory
brings me no honor.</font>

660
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,210
<font color="#ffff80">Imagine how you're going
to feel when you lose.</font>

661
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,402
<font color="#ffff80">I felt loss only once.</font>

662
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,965
<font color="#ffff80">Eleven years ago,
I lost my sister.</font>

663
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,926
<font color="#ffff80">She fell in love with a fool
and betrayed our father!</font>

664
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,802
<font color="#ffff80">She was an
ungrateful coward!</font>

665
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,928
<font color="#ffff80">Who's the coward now?</font>

666
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,448
<font color="#ffff80">I got it! I got it!</font>

667
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:34,082
<font color="#ffff80">Beetle, what happened?
Where's Kubo?</font>

668
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,890
<font color="#ffff80">Um...</font>

669
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,166
<font color="#ffff80">Uh-oh.</font>

670
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,646
<font color="#ffff80">Get back down there!
He's in trouble!</font>

671
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,969
<font color="#ffff80">I got it.</font>

672
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,330
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Mother. Mother.</i></font>

673
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,286
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Mother. Mother.</i></font>

674
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,250
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Mother.</i></font>

675
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,004
<font color="#ffff80">It never fails to amaze me</font>

676
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:54,722
<font color="#ffff80">how the creatures down here fight
so hard just to die another day.</font>

677
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,724
<font color="#ffff80">Down here, there are
days worth fighting for.</font>

678
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,249
<font color="#ffff80">There is nothing down
here worth anything!</font>

679
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:11,251
<font color="#ffff80">It's pathetic what
happened to my sister.</font>

680
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:14,244
<font color="#ffff80">I looked up to her.
She was so strong.</font>

681
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,651
<font color="#ffff80">And love made her weak.</font>

682
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:18,721
<font color="#ffff80">No!</font>

683
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,611
<font color="#ffff80">It made me stronger.</font>

684
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:39,881
<font color="#ffff80">Over here.</font>

685
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:42,965
<font color="#ffff80">The eyes...</font>

686
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,966
<font color="#ffff80">It was the eyes.</font>

687
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,285
<font color="#ffff80">They had him in a trance.</font>

688
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,051
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, no.</font>

689
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,565
<font color="#ffff80">No.</font>

690
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,166
<font color="#ffff80">Come on. Come on, Kubo.</font>

691
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,403
<font color="#ffff80">Wake up. Please wake up!</font>

692
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:01,604
<font color="#ffff80">Please, please wake up.</font>

693
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,130
<font color="#ffff80">It's gonna be all right.</font>

694
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,604
<font color="#ffff80">It's gonna be all right.</font>

695
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,281
<font color="#ffff80">I'm here.</font>

696
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:10,845
<font color="#ffff80">I'm right here.</font>

697
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,321
<font color="#ffff80">I saw...</font>

698
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,444
<font color="#ffff80">What? What did you see?</font>

699
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,001
<font color="#ffff80">I saw...</font>

700
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,487
<font color="#ffff80">Mother.</font>

701
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:44,726
<font color="#ffff80">My son.</font>

702
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,444
<font color="#ffff80">So, you must look
more like your dad, then?</font>

703
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,771
<font color="#ffff80">You're staring.</font>

704
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,480
<font color="#ffff80">Let me guess.
You have questions.</font>

705
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,964
<font color="#ffff80">Why...
I'll start.</font>

706
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:16,681
<font color="#ffff80">First question. If I'm
Beetle and you're Monkey,</font>

707
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,364
<font color="#ffff80">why isn't he called "Boy"?</font>

708
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:21,721
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, boy.</font>

709
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,929
<font color="#ffff80">Questions can wait.</font>

710
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:26,641
<font color="#ffff80">We need sleep.</font>

711
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,724
<font color="#ffff80">Tell us your story,
then we can sleep.</font>

712
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:31,641
<font color="#ffff80">Please?</font>

713
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,087
<font color="#ffff80">Okay.</font>

714
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,250
<font color="#ffff80">Perhaps you can help me.</font>

715
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,601
<font color="#ffff80">The night I met
your father...</font>

716
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:51,966
<font color="#ffff80">Mother.</font>

717
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:01,005
<font color="#ffff80">My sisters and I went to the
Temple of Bones to kill Hanzo.</font>

718
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:07,566
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, right.</font>

719
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,248
<font color="#ffff80">At the bidding
of the Moon King,</font>

720
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:20,130
<font color="#ffff80">my sisters and I had come
down from the night sky</font>

721
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,407
<font color="#ffff80">and killed many
noble warriors.</font>

722
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,361
<font color="#ffff80">Your grandfather told us</font>

723
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:28,125
<font color="#ffff80">that any man who
found the magical armor</font>

724
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,890
<font color="#ffff80">would grow too powerful</font>

725
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,883
<font color="#ffff80">and be a threat
to the heavens.</font>

726
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:36,206
<font color="#ffff80">That night, I arrived at
the temple before my sisters.</font>

727
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:41,481
<font color="#ffff80">And there he was,
the mighty Hanzo.</font>

728
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,331
<font color="#ffff80">"You have offended
my father," I told him.</font>

729
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,489
<font color="#ffff80">"Now you must die."</font>

730
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,961
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah, that's so you.</font>

731
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,883
<font color="#ffff80">Beetle. Shh!</font>

732
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,125
<font color="#ffff80">We fought.</font>

733
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:02,805
<font color="#ffff80">Hanzo was strong.</font>

734
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,331
<font color="#ffff80">But then he stopped.</font>

735
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:09,442
<font color="#ffff80">He looked into my eyes and
uttered four simple words.</font>

736
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,768
<font color="#ffff80">These words
changed everything.</font>

737
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:17,281
<font color="#ffff80">"I love you,</font>

738
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,405
<font color="#ffff80">"Monkey"?</font>

739
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,887
<font color="#ffff80">"You are my quest,"</font>

740
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,200
<font color="#ffff80">he whispered.</font>

741
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,081
<font color="#ffff80">I had seen the wonders
of the universe,</font>

742
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:32,006
<font color="#ffff80">but the warmth of his gaze
as I looked into his eyes...</font>

743
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,686
<font color="#ffff80">That...
That I had never known.</font>

744
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:39,287
<font color="#ffff80">It was his humanity I saw.</font>

745
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,283
<font color="#ffff80">And it was more powerful
than anything</font>

746
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:43,203
<font color="#ffff80">in my cold realm.</font>

747
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,771
<font color="#ffff80">In recognizing
his compassion,</font>

748
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,530
<font color="#ffff80">I recognized my own.</font>

749
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,890
<font color="#ffff80">I spared his life.</font>

750
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,050
<font color="#ffff80">He gave me mine.</font>

751
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,925
<font color="#ffff80">And...
And then he gave me you.</font>

752
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,123
<font color="#ffff80">But your grandfather
found us.</font>

753
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:04,641
<font color="#ffff80">His rage at my betrayal
shook the heavens.</font>

754
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:13,562
<font color="#ffff80">Your father and his army
gave their lives,</font>

755
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:16,405
<font color="#ffff80">allowing me to escape
with you in my arms.</font>

756
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,605
<font color="#ffff80">Why does Grandfather
hate me?</font>

757
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,686
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, Kubo...</font>

758
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,530
<font color="#ffff80">He doesn't hate you.</font>

759
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:31,244
<font color="#ffff80">He wants to make
you just like him.</font>

760
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,004
<font color="#ffff80">Blind to humanity,</font>

761
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,004
<font color="#ffff80">as I once was.</font>

762
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,722
<font color="#ffff80">Only then can you take
your place beside him</font>

763
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,484
<font color="#ffff80">as part of his family.</font>

764
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,128
<font color="#ffff80">Cold and hard.</font>

765
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,051
<font color="#ffff80">And perfect.</font>

766
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,966
<font color="#ffff80">I'll never be like him,
never.</font>

767
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,160
<font color="#ffff80">I know.</font>

768
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,566
<font color="#ffff80">He's exhausted.</font>

769
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:07,641
<font color="#ffff80">Mmm.</font>

770
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,641
<font color="#ffff80">Me, too.</font>

771
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:11,449
<font color="#ffff80">I'm not tucking you in.</font>

772
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,041
<font color="#ffff80">You're hurt.</font>

773
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,125
<font color="#ffff80">It's just a scratch.</font>

774
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:27,924
<font color="#ffff80">Monkey, why didn't you tell him
sooner who you really are?</font>

775
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:34,129
<font color="#ffff80">The magic that keeps
me here, it's fading.</font>

776
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,970
<font color="#ffff80">Soon I'll be gone.</font>

777
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:40,241
<font color="#ffff80">And then Kubo
will be alone again.</font>

778
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,481
<font color="#ffff80">Not alone.</font>

779
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:44,281
<font color="#ffff80">He is the son of Hanzo.</font>

780
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:47,807
<font color="#ffff80">I will do everything I can
to keep him from harm.</font>

781
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:50,284
<font color="#ffff80">Thank you, Beetle.</font>

782
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:55,482
<font color="#ffff80">To know Kubo has someone to
watch over him when I'm gone.</font>

783
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,845
<font color="#ffff80">That would be a fine way
to end my story.</font>

784
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:04,322
<font color="#ffff80">Your story will never end.</font>

785
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:09,169
<font color="#ffff80">It will be told by him and by
the people he shares it with.</font>

786
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,368
<font color="#ffff80">And by the people
they share it with.</font>

787
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,001
<font color="#ffff80">And by the people
they share it with,</font>

788
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,321
<font color="#ffff80">and by the people
they share it with.</font>

789
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,050
<font color="#ffff80">And by the people...
Beetle.</font>

790
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:23,008
<font color="#ffff80">The point is
your story will live on</font>

791
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,001
<font color="#ffff80">in him.</font>

792
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:56,924
<font color="#ffff80">Hello, my young friend.</font>

793
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,682
<font color="#ffff80">Why don't you
join in my song?</font>

794
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,926
<font color="#ffff80">But how did you...</font>

795
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:04,600
<font color="#ffff80">You're...
Even blinder than you?</font>

796
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,129
<font color="#ffff80">Twice as much,
to be precise.</font>

797
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,730
<font color="#ffff80">Which means I see
double the truth.</font>

798
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,285
<font color="#ffff80">This is all a dream.</font>

799
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,203
<font color="#ffff80">Is this a good dream
or a bad one?</font>

800
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,204
<font color="#ffff80">See for yourself.</font>

801
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,843
<font color="#ffff80">My father's fortress.</font>

802
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:39,921
<font color="#ffff80">Yes.</font>

803
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,770
<font color="#ffff80">The last piece
of the armor.</font>

804
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,286
<font color="#ffff80">It's here?</font>

805
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:54,129
<font color="#ffff80">Follow the setting sun
and you'll find it,</font>

806
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,603
<font color="#ffff80">in the place that
might have been your home.</font>

807
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:01,205
<font color="#ffff80">Claim your birthright, Kubo.</font>

808
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:05,409
<font color="#ffff80">Give this story
a happy ending.</font>

809
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:12,722
<font color="#ffff80">Mother! Beetle! Wake up!</font>

810
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,529
<font color="#ffff80">I'm up. I'm up.</font>

811
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,648
<font color="#ffff80">Well, I'm down.</font>

812
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,087
<font color="#ffff80">Off.</font>

813
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,209
<font color="#ffff80">I think I slept
on something.</font>

814
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:23,484
<font color="#ffff80">Sword uncomfortable.</font>

815
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,888
<font color="#ffff80">The helmet,
I know where it is.</font>

816
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,644
<font color="#ffff80">I saw it in a dream, Beetle.</font>

817
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,491
<font color="#ffff80">A dream?</font>

818
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,726
<font color="#ffff80">Well, it doesn't mean
anything in particular.</font>

819
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,805
<font color="#ffff80">I mean, I dreamed I fought a giant
skeleton with swords in its head.</font>

820
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,242
<font color="#ffff80">That really happened.</font>

821
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,560
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, yeah.</font>

822
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:42,245
<font color="#ffff80">Beetle.</font>

823
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,243
<font color="#ffff80">Come on, this way.</font>

824
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:26,365
<font color="#ffff80">I spy with my one eye
something beginning with "S".</font>

825
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,371
<font color="#ffff80">Snow?
No.</font>

826
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:33,361
<font color="#ffff80">Snowflake?</font>

827
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,290
<font color="#ffff80">No.
Okay.</font>

828
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,127
<font color="#ffff80">Oh. Pfft.</font>

829
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,326
<font color="#ffff80">Snow covered trees.</font>

830
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,289
<font color="#ffff80">Nothing to do with snow.</font>

831
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,963
<font color="#ffff80">How about "serious"?</font>

832
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,166
<font color="#ffff80">Stupid.</font>

833
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,531
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, I got it.</font>

834
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,806
<font color="#ffff80">Snow.</font>

835
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,565
<font color="#ffff80">He said it wasn't "snow."</font>

836
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,325
<font color="#ffff80">It's a song.</font>

837
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,845
<font color="#ffff80">Well, that's not fair.</font>

838
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:56,285
<font color="#ffff80">How do you see a song?</font>

839
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,361
<font color="#ffff80">You look.</font>

840
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,405
<font color="#ffff80">Golden heron.</font>

841
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,090
<font color="#ffff80">It's believed they hold the
souls of the departed,</font>

842
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,561
<font color="#ffff80">carrying them over
to wherever they need to go.</font>

843
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,401
<font color="#ffff80">Hmm.</font>

844
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,730
<font color="#ffff80">What are they singing?</font>

845
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,331
<font color="#ffff80">It's beautiful.</font>

846
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:17,927
<font color="#ffff80">Many say the song's about
what happens when we die.</font>

847
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:22,123
<font color="#ffff80">How we don't
just disappear.</font>

848
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:23,681
<font color="#ffff80">We don't?</font>

849
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,206
<font color="#ffff80">Uh, so, what happens to us?</font>

850
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,688
<font color="#ffff80">Well, like Kubo's paper,
we shift.</font>

851
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,206
<font color="#ffff80">We transform so we can
continue our story</font>

852
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,566
<font color="#ffff80">to another place.</font>

853
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:37,085
<font color="#ffff80">The end of one story is merely
the beginning of another.</font>

854
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,969
<font color="#ffff80">I remember this place.</font>

855
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:45,330
<font color="#ffff80">This was where my father
prepared for his quest.</font>

856
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:12,966
<font color="#ffff80">There's something
I don't understand.</font>

857
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,849
<font color="#ffff80">Why would the helmet
be here?</font>

858
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:20,886
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo!</font>

859
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,160
<font color="#ffff80">Release us!</font>

860
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:56,570
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, sister.</font>

861
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,402
<font color="#ffff80">I remember how we
looked up to you.</font>

862
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,206
<font color="#ffff80">Of all of us,
you shone the brightest.</font>

863
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,485
<font color="#ffff80">Such a waste.</font>

864
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:11,489
<font color="#ffff80">All we ever wished was to be a
family in our home among the stars.</font>

865
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:15,088
<font color="#ffff80">I think we have very different
definitions of family.</font>

866
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,208
<font color="#ffff80">Don't you touch him,
you witch!</font>

867
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,691
<font color="#ffff80">And then there's you,</font>

868
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:22,207
<font color="#ffff80">the thieving insect
who stole my sister's soul.</font>

869
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,281
<font color="#ffff80">What?</font>

870
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,123
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, this is precious.</font>

871
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,243
<font color="#ffff80">You've been
together all this time</font>

872
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:31,527
<font color="#ffff80">and you haven't
even realized?</font>

873
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:38,122
<font color="#ffff80">You took her from us.</font>

874
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,965
<font color="#ffff80">It was only fitting
we took something from you.</font>

875
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:44,324
<font color="#ffff80">How swiftly those memories
spilled from your head,</font>

876
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:48,724
<font color="#ffff80">wiping out all recollection
of your obscene union.</font>

877
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,040
<font color="#ffff80">Hanzo.</font>

878
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:51,721
<font color="#ffff80">What?</font>

879
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:53,801
<font color="#ffff80">Hanzo?</font>

880
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,489
<font color="#ffff80">I... I didn't know.</font>

881
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:02,170
<font color="#ffff80">No!</font>

882
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,643
<font color="#ffff80">I'm forgetting
what I came here for.</font>

883
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:00,446
<font color="#ffff80">Mother!</font>

884
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,768
<font color="#ffff80">Shh. It's okay. I'm here.</font>

885
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:21,766
<font color="#ffff80">Father?</font>

886
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:23,801
<font color="#ffff80">My son.</font>

887
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:32,248
<font color="#ffff80">Seems I'm married to a bug.</font>

888
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,326
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah.</font>

889
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,885
<font color="#ffff80">But a samurai bug.</font>

890
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,642
<font color="#ffff80">You are my quest.</font>

891
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,410
<font color="#ffff80">You always have been.</font>

892
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:51,889
<font color="#ffff80">Hanzo, keep him safe,
no matter what.</font>

893
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,210
<font color="#ffff80">I promise I will.</font>

894
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:06,807
<font color="#ffff80">No!</font>

895
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,522
<font color="#ffff80">Fly home, Kubo.</font>

896
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,202
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo? Is that you?</font>

897
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:13,969
<font color="#ffff80">You have to
leave this place.</font>

898
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:16,486
<font color="#ffff80">The Moon King, he's coming.</font>

899
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:31,720
<font color="#ffff80">Grandfather!</font>

900
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,050
<font color="#ffff80">It's me, Kubo!</font>

901
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,809
<font color="#ffff80">I know you can see me!</font>

902
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,482
<font color="#ffff80">Hello, grandson.</font>

903
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,567
<font color="#ffff80">It's so good to
see you at last.</font>

904
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,650
<font color="#ffff80">Soto speak.</font>

905
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:52,363
<font color="#ffff80">And I see you found
the armor.</font>

906
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:55,449
<font color="#ffff80">Seems your mother
had a reason</font>

907
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:58,205
<font color="#ffff80">to bring you to this
dreadful place after all.</font>

908
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,326
<font color="#ffff80">I see.</font>

909
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:07,526
<font color="#ffff80">I know you do.</font>

910
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,288
<font color="#ffff80">That's how this all began.
You finally saw me.</font>

911
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:15,482
<font color="#ffff80">It was my fault. I should've
listened to my parents.</font>

912
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:21,682
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo, we both want
the exact same thing.</font>

913
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:24,843
<font color="#ffff80">You want to take my other eye.
That's what you want!</font>

914
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:30,408
<font color="#ffff80">Well, yes. But do you
know why I want it?</font>

915
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:35,086
<font color="#ffff80">Because you're old,
and mean, and cruel.</font>

916
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:37,811
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, now,
that's a little harsh.</font>

917
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:42,044
<font color="#ffff80">As long as you cling
to that silly, useless eye,</font>

918
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:45,044
<font color="#ffff80">you can't come up
to live with me.</font>

919
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:47,324
<font color="#ffff80">In the heavens.</font>

920
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:52,641
<font color="#ffff80">You'll be stuck
down here in this hell,</font>

921
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:58,329
<font color="#ffff80">staring with that lonely eye
at hate and heartache</font>

922
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:02,485
<font color="#ffff80">and suffering and death.</font>

923
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,091
<font color="#ffff80">Where I want to
take you,</font>

924
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:10,483
<font color="#ffff80">we have none
of those things.</font>

925
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:13,848
<font color="#ffff80">It'll just be you
with your family.</font>

926
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,766
<font color="#ffff80">Where you belong.</font>

927
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,002
<font color="#ffff80">My family is gone.</font>

928
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,686
<font color="#ffff80">You killed them.
No...</font>

929
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:24,367
<font color="#ffff80">They brought their
fates upon themselves!</font>

930
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:29,606
<font color="#ffff80">They disgraced me and upset
the order of everything!</font>

931
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:31,762
<font color="#ffff80">That's how
your story goes.</font>

932
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:35,085
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, Kubo...</font>

933
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:40,242
<font color="#ffff80">When you're up there with me,
you will be beyond stories.</font>

934
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:44,769
<font color="#ffff80">You will be immortal.</font>

935
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:46,929
<font color="#ffff80">You will be</font>

936
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:50,929
<font color="#ffff80">infinite.</font>

937
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:55,287
<font color="#ffff80">No. You're wrong,
not infinite.</font>

938
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:57,601
<font color="#ffff80">All stories have an end.</font>

939
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:00,128
<font color="#ffff80">Is that right?</font>

940
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:04,123
<font color="#ffff80">And how does
this story end?</font>

941
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,684
<font color="#ffff80">I kill you.</font>

942
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:09,761
<font color="#ffff80">Oh.</font>

943
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,884
<font color="#ffff80">Very well.
Is this your wish,</font>

944
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:17,363
<font color="#ffff80">to do battle with a hideous
monster who ruined your life,</font>

945
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:22,162
<font color="#ffff80">to prove your worth
like your doomed father?</font>

946
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:24,489
<font color="#ffff80">How mortal.</font>

947
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,211
<font color="#ffff80">You want to be human?</font>

948
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:51,280
<font color="#ffff80">Then share their weakness!</font>

949
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:55,722
<font color="#ffff80">Suffer their humiliation!</font>

950
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:59,562
<font color="#ffff80">Feel their pain!</font>

951
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:47,205
<font color="#ffff80">This is the end
of your story.</font>

952
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:51,968
<font color="#ffff80">Now, take one last
look with that lonely eye,</font>

953
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:58,571
<font color="#ffff80">one last look at this
wretched place you call home.</font>

954
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:01,849
<font color="#ffff80">I'm not leaving.</font>

955
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:04,443
<font color="#ffff80">For every horrible thing
down here,</font>

956
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:07,402
<font color="#ffff80">there's something
far more beautiful.</font>

957
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:09,689
<font color="#ffff80">My mother saw it.</font>

958
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:12,161
<font color="#ffff80">So did my father. I see it.</font>

959
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:14,249
<font color="#ffff80">Even with just one eye.</font>

960
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:18,644
<font color="#ffff80">Then I'll just have to rip
it out of your head again,</font>

961
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:20,160
<font color="#ffff80">won't I?</font>

962
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,691
<font color="#ffff80">If you must blink,
do it now.</font>

963
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,968
<font color="#ffff80">I know why
you want my eye.</font>

964
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:33,966
<font color="#ffff80">Because without it,</font>

965
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:37,328
<font color="#ffff80">I can't look into the eyes of
another and see their soul.</font>

966
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:41,247
<font color="#ffff80">Their love...
Everything you loved is gone!</font>

967
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,482
<font color="#ffff80">Everything you knew
has been taken from you!</font>

968
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:46,766
<font color="#ffff80">No.</font>

969
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:48,285
<font color="#ffff80">It's in my memories.</font>

970
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:50,761
<font color="#ffff80">The most powerful
kind of magic there is.</font>

971
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:06,565
<font color="#ffff80">It makes us stronger
than you'll ever be.</font>

972
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:13,491
<font color="#ffff80">These are the memories of
those we have loved and lost.</font>

973
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:17,203
<font color="#ffff80">And if we hold their stories
deep in our hearts,</font>

974
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:20,644
<font color="#ffff80">then you will never
take them away from us.</font>

975
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:35,362
<font color="#ffff80">And that really
is the least of it.</font>

976
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:56,970
<font color="#ffff80">Where am I?</font>

977
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,202
<font color="#ffff80">Hello, Grandfather.</font>

978
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:00,966
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, hello.</font>

979
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:05,128
<font color="#ffff80">What happened to your eye?</font>

980
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:06,931
<font color="#ffff80">Don't you remember?</font>

981
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:11,167
<font color="#ffff80">No, I... I'm sorry,
young man.</font>

982
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,446
<font color="#ffff80">But I seem to have
forgotten my story.</font>

983
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,604
<font color="#ffff80">Can you help me?</font>

984
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,005
<font color="#ffff80">I'll tell him.</font>

985
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:22,730
<font color="#ffff80">No, we'll all tell him.</font>

986
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,565
<font color="#ffff80">We'll tell him
everything he needs to know.</font>

987
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:30,604
<font color="#ffff80">You are the kindest,
sweetest man</font>

988
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:32,489
<font color="#ffff80">to ever live
in this village.</font>

989
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:34,449
<font color="#ffff80">Oh. Oh, really?
Yes.</font>

990
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:35,726
<font color="#ffff80">Uh... Uh...</font>

991
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:38,041
<font color="#ffff80">Every day,
you walk around smiling</font>

992
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:39,884
<font color="#ffff80">and handing out
coins to children.</font>

993
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:41,041
<font color="#ffff80">Like me!</font>

994
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,849
<font color="#ffff80">And old women.</font>

995
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:43,921
<font color="#ffff80">Oh.</font>

996
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,571
<font color="#ffff80">You... You taught
my kids to swim.</font>

997
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:47,687
<font color="#ffff80">What?</font>

998
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,967
<font color="#ffff80">And you give
blankets to the poor.</font>

999
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:51,007
<font color="#ffff80">You're a good man.</font>

1000
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:53,646
<font color="#ffff80">You fed the hungry. You
always lend a helping hand.</font>

1001
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:55,927
<font color="#ffff80">You're a great
example.</font>

1002
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:59,450
<font color="#ffff80">It turns out
I'm pretty selfless.</font>

1003
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,170
<font color="#ffff80">That's why we love you.</font>

1004
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:05,245
<font color="#ffff80">You know, we have
something in common.</font>

1005
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:07,527
<font color="#ffff80">We both adore
your grandson.</font>

1006
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:11,207
<font color="#ffff80">His name is Kubo.</font>

1007
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:14,930
<font color="#ffff80">Kubo?</font>

1008
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:18,010
<font color="#ffff80">I'm sorry.</font>

1009
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,890
<font color="#ffff80">But I...
But I don't remember.</font>

1010
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:23,761
<font color="#ffff80">Well...</font>

1011
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:26,840
<font color="#ffff80">Your grandson's
a storyteller.</font>

1012
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:30,684
<font color="#ffff80">He'll tell you all the
stories you've forgotten.</font>

1013
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:33,326
<font color="#ffff80">Really?</font>

1014
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:38,125
<font color="#ffff80">Of course.</font>

1015
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:06,881
<font color="#ffff80">Hello, Mother.</font>

1016
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:08,881
<font color="#ffff80">Father.</font>

1017
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:15,286
<font color="#ffff80">I know my stories can tend
to get a little, um, long,</font>

1018
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:17,886
<font color="#ffff80">so I'll keep this brief.</font>

1019
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:22,203
<font color="#ffff80">I'm very grateful I've had
the chance to meet you both,</font>

1020
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:26,208
<font color="#ffff80">hear your wisdom,
feel your kindness,</font>

1021
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:29,487
<font color="#ffff80">even eat a meal
sitting between you.</font>

1022
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:32,569
<font color="#ffff80">This was a happy story.</font>

1023
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:37,240
<font color="#ffff80">But it could still be
a whole lot happier.</font>

1024
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:42,841
<font color="#ffff80">I don't know exactly
what the rules are</font>

1025
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:44,809
<font color="#ffff80">or how this works,</font>

1026
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:47,528
<font color="#ffff80">but if there
were any way to...</font>

1027
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:51,842
<font color="#ffff80">You know, I still need you.</font>

1028
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:56,288
<font color="#ffff80">So I can say this
has been a happy story,</font>

1029
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:57,725
<font color="#ffff80">or I could feel it.</font>

1030
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,923
<font color="#ffff80">We could all feel it.</font>

1031
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:02,723
<font color="#ffff80">Then we could
end this story.</font>

1032
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,240
<font color="#ffff80">Together.</font>

1033
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:49,401
<font color="#ffff80"><i>The end.</i></font>
