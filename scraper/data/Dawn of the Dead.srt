I got this one.

314
00:26:35,445 --> 00:26:37,728
There's a lot of private planes
in farm country like this.

315
00:26:38,727 --> 00:26:41,068
I guess they all hit the pumps
and they took off.

316
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:41,856
Yeah, to where?

317
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:43,052
Got some here.

318
00:26:44,084 --> 00:26:45,384
- Can you handle that?
- Yeah, I got it.

319
00:26:47,658 --> 00:26:49,091
I'm gonna see what's left
in the hangars.

320
00:27:42,513 --> 00:27:43,912
Bunch of junk!

321
00:28:01,141 --> 00:28:01,969
Steve?

322
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,162
Fran, Run!

323
00:28:18,332 --> 00:28:19,332
Run!

324
00:28:46,644 --> 00:28:47,644
Run!

325
00:29:04,506 --> 00:29:05,506
Roger!

326
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:52,919
It's all right...

327
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:54,021
Peter!

328
00:30:55,786 --> 00:30:57,423
Right... Fuck!

329
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,527
You never aim a gun at anyone, Mr.

330
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:20,909
Peter, my god!
What are you doin'?

331
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,442
Scary... Isn't it?

332
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,500
Isn't it?

333
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:32,849
C'mon.

334
00:31:45,391 --> 00:31:48,994
We gotta find fuel.
Maybe closer to Cleveland.

335
00:31:48,995 --> 00:31:50,940
No, we've gotta stay
out of the big cities.

336
00:31:50,941 --> 00:31:53,079
If it's anything like Philly we
might never get out alive.

337
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,834
We might never get out
of any place alive.

338
00:31:54,834 --> 00:31:58,147
- We didn't almost get out of there.
- We're gettin' outta here fine!

339
00:31:58,306 --> 00:32:00,897
As long as there's not too many of
those things we can handle 'em easy.

340
00:32:00,898 --> 00:32:03,515
It wasn't one of "those things"
that nearly blew me away.

341
00:32:04,271 --> 00:32:06,261
We gotta stay in the sticks.

342
00:32:07,805 --> 00:32:09,833
There's bound to be more little
private airports upstate.

343
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:11,638
There's the locks along the Allegheny.

344
00:32:11,857 --> 00:32:14,065
Fuel stations there.
State. Private.

345
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:16,221
Those are probably still manned.
We don't need those hassles either.

346
00:32:16,222 --> 00:32:18,037
They're just out after
scavengers and looters.

347
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:19,807
Oh, you got the papers
for this limousine?

348
00:32:19,808 --> 00:32:21,998
I got J.A.S id.
And so does Fran.

349
00:32:21,999 --> 00:32:24,530
Right! And we're out here
doin' traffic reports.

350
00:32:24,531 --> 00:32:25,906
Wake up, sucker!

351
00:32:25,907 --> 00:32:29,301
We're thieves and we're bad guys!
That's exactly what we are.

352
00:32:30,195 --> 00:32:31,764
We gotta find our own way.

353
00:32:31,765 --> 00:32:33,591
Jesus Christ! We don't even
know where we going

354
00:32:33,592 --> 00:32:36,435
We don't have food. We don't have
water. We don't even have a radio.

355
00:32:38,518 --> 00:32:40,532
Stephen you need to
get some sleep.

356
00:32:52,453 --> 00:32:53,630
[Peter] What the hell is it?

357
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:57,934
[Roger] Looks like a... shopping center.
One of those big indoor lots.

358
00:33:38,075 --> 00:33:39,075
[Fran] Oh my God!

359
00:33:39,076 --> 00:33:40,473
No chance. Forget it.
Let's get out of here!

360
00:33:40,474 --> 00:33:42,036
Wait a minute. They can't
get up here.

361
00:33:42,036 --> 00:33:43,659
[Steve] Yeah, I we can't
go down there!

362
00:33:43,659 --> 00:33:44,961
[Roger] Let's check it out.

363
00:34:09,395 --> 00:34:12,681
Most of the gates are down.
I don't think they can get into the stores.

364
00:34:12,682 --> 00:34:14,746
I haven't seen any of then
up on the second floor.

365
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:18,147
The big departments stores
usually use both floors.

366
00:34:18,148 --> 00:34:19,224
If we can get it up top...

367
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:20,891
Ok.

368
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:38,835
Guess the power's not off in
this area. Could be nuclear.

369
00:34:39,647 --> 00:34:41,686
[Fran] What are they doing?
Why do they come here?

370
00:34:41,687 --> 00:34:42,943
Some kind of instinct.

371
00:34:42,944 --> 00:34:46,029
Memory... Of what they
used to do.

372
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,154
This was an important
place in their lives.

373
00:34:50,275 --> 00:34:52,366
Hey... Look at this!

374
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,879
These don't go down to the mall.

375
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:00,289
What the hell is this?

376
00:35:07,551 --> 00:35:08,270
How do we get down there?

377
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:50,525
Ok, c'mon Fran, let go.

378
00:35:50,526 --> 00:35:52,010
Well, it's done.

379
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,770
Looks like a free lunch.

380
00:35:59,436 --> 00:36:00,627
Spam!

381
00:36:00,628 --> 00:36:02,164
Do you bring a can opener?

382
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:04,160
No, I guess I didn't.

383
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:05,948
Then don't knock it.
It got its own key.

384
00:36:10,806 --> 00:36:11,789
What do you think?

385
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,172
This is the only way up here.
What do you think?

386
00:36:49,077 --> 00:36:50,637
You better get some sleep too, buddy.

387
00:36:54,356 --> 00:36:57,338
There's an awful lot of stuff
down there that we could use.

388
00:36:59,446 --> 00:37:00,779
I know it.

389
00:37:01,035 --> 00:37:05,843
Big place. But they're pretty
spread down there.

390
00:37:06,995 --> 00:37:08,099
I think we can out-run 'em

391
00:37:08,982 --> 00:37:09,652
Hit and run?

392
00:37:09,653 --> 00:37:10,944
Hit and run.

393
00:37:12,885 --> 00:37:14,041
Are you crazy?

394
00:37:14,042 --> 00:37:16,827
This place could be a gold mine.
We gotta a least check it out.

395
00:37:17,126 --> 00:37:20,056
This is exactly what we're
trying to go away from... Look what...

396
00:37:20,057 --> 00:37:21,057
Stephen!

397
00:37:21,058 --> 00:37:23,164
Leave him be.
We're going ourselves.

398
00:37:24,211 --> 00:37:25,777
That's ready to shoot. Be careful.

399
00:37:25,778 --> 00:37:27,690
The trigger squeezes really easy...

400
00:37:27,691 --> 00:37:31,314
but the weapon'll kick you good
when it fires. Be ready for that!

401
00:37:31,812 --> 00:37:34,849
Anyone but us comes up the stairs,
you guys take off in the machine.

402
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:44,502
You'll probably hear some shooting.
Just don't panic, ok?

403
00:38:11,802 --> 00:38:12,828
Here.

404
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,580
Keys to the kingdom.

405
00:38:50,385 --> 00:38:52,209
Grab the walkie talkies.

406
00:39:38,026 --> 00:39:40,225
It's Christmas time down there, buddy.

407
00:39:40,226 --> 00:39:42,741
Fat city, brother. How we gonna work it?

408
00:39:44,185 --> 00:39:48,570
We get into one of the stores up here.
They'll probably have their own escalators.

409
00:39:48,571 --> 00:39:50,140
Let's check those keys.

410
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,422
Fifteen upper and lower.

411
00:39:53,223 --> 00:39:54,499
Right here.

412
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,692
How about a little music?

413
00:39:56,206 --> 00:39:56,924
What?

414
00:39:57,287 --> 00:39:58,513
Might cover the noise we make.

415
00:40:03,751 --> 00:40:06,779
Hit 'em all. Might as well
have power in everything.

416
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,882
We might need it.

417
00:40:36,866 --> 00:40:37,962
Stephen?

418
00:40:38,357 --> 00:40:39,357
Stephen!

419
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:35,025
What do you think?
Bag it or try for it?

420
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:36,363
- You game?
- I need lighter fuel.

421
00:41:36,364 --> 00:41:37,894
You got it.

422
00:41:49,698 --> 00:41:53,381
Jesus Christ! They're maniacs!

423
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,399
Wait...

424
00:42:10,065 --> 00:42:11,225
Alright!

425
00:42:14,093 --> 00:42:15,229
C'mon!

426
00:42:18,378 --> 00:42:19,831
Stephen, don't go down there!

427
00:42:19,985 --> 00:42:21,186
- Bastard!
- What happen?

428
00:42:21,187 --> 00:42:22,388
Don't open!

429
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:25,513
Not working!

430
00:42:44,243 --> 00:42:45,243
C'mon!

431
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:56,613
Don't open the door! C'mon!

432
00:43:04,636 --> 00:43:06,375
Let her go!
Take care of the other one!

433
00:43:18,795 --> 00:43:19,771
Stephen, for God sake!

434
00:43:19,772 --> 00:43:22,632
We can't leave those
guys down there.

435
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:26,267
[Roger] Well... We're in.
Now how the hell we're gonna get back?

436
00:43:26,268 --> 00:43:28,829
[Peter] Who the hell cares?
Let's go shopping first!

437
00:43:30,715 --> 00:43:32,058
[Roger] Watch it! Watch it!

438
00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:35,831
[Peter] Just let's get the stuff we need!
I'm gonna get us a television and a radio!

439
00:43:35,832 --> 00:43:38,921
[Roger] Ok, find the goods.
I got them! I got them!

440
00:43:38,922 --> 00:43:39,922
[Peter] Ok.

441
00:43:42,916 --> 00:43:43,805
[Roger] I'm gonna need
at least a couple!

442
00:43:43,806 --> 00:43:44,765
[Peter] Why not?

443
00:44:09,361 --> 00:44:11,672
Hey man, we can't carry all that shit.

444
00:44:12,935 --> 00:44:14,963
Oh, I see. We're just
gonna wheel right by 'em.

445
00:44:14,964 --> 00:44:21,137
We gonna try brother. We ain't doin' this for
the exercise. We might try to get what we can.

446
00:44:53,084 --> 00:44:56,308
Alright. Let's go brother!
The old okey dokey!

447
00:44:59,481 --> 00:45:02,399
- Hey, Ugly!
- Let's raise some hell... Hey... Hey...!

448
00:45:03,216 --> 00:45:05,005
- Come here champ! Come here!
- Over here... Hey... Hey...!

449
00:45:06,765 --> 00:45:09,713
- C'mon, over here!
- Over here! That's right!

450
00:45:09,714 --> 00:45:11,585
C'mon, C'mon...
C'mon, C'mon...!

451
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,517
Alright, c'mon!

452
00:45:19,635 --> 00:45:21,123
C'mon... Over here...

453
00:45:24,236 --> 00:45:27,310
Just give it time...
give it time.

454
00:45:49,347 --> 00:45:51,771
Ok. They're coming.

455
00:45:51,984 --> 00:45:56,246
Go on up. Stay outta sight but
lemme know when is clear enough.

456
00:45:56,247 --> 00:45:57,318
- Ok.
- Ok.

457
00:45:59,722 --> 00:46:04,262
Come to papa! That's it.
Keep coming... Keep coming.

458
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:14,696
Peter, it's good. Let's do it.

459
00:46:14,697 --> 00:46:15,805
Is it clear?

460
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:18,288
Not altogether... But they
spread out pretty good.

461
00:46:18,289 --> 00:46:20,681
- I think we can move the wagon.
[Peter on radio] - I'm comin'

462
00:46:55,649 --> 00:46:57,815
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know... Fuzz maybe?

463
00:46:57,816 --> 00:46:59,818
- Or maybe flyboy. Where's it comin' from?

464
00:46:59,819 --> 00:47:00,819
- I don't know. I can't tell.

465
00:47:53,277 --> 00:47:53,801
C'mon. Open up.

466
00:47:54,944 --> 00:47:57,865
- Maybe I'd go with you.
- Open up so I can get the wagon over!

467
00:47:57,866 --> 00:48:00,762
- If it's flyboy, let's get him on our side.
- Ok.

468
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,882
- You just cover me good. You hear?
- You got it!

469
00:49:20,888 --> 00:49:22,772
[Peter] Hold it flyboy!

470
00:49:22,773 --> 00:49:24,314
Don't go into the stairway!

471
00:49:26,449 --> 00:49:29,826
Don't open that door, baby.
You'll lead 'em right up with you.

472
00:49:30,538 --> 00:49:32,182
Run for it. Run this way.

473
00:49:37,477 --> 00:49:42,898
That's it. C'mon! Run...
Run... Run... C'mon!

474
00:49:44,041 --> 00:49:47,436
Now... Head for the department store.
Go!

475
00:50:11,093 --> 00:50:13,637
Ok, downstairs again...
Same trick... Let's go!

476
00:51:32,975 --> 00:51:35,653
- What do we do?
- Let them know we're here.

477
00:51:35,654 --> 00:51:39,925
Whoooo Hoooo!
C'mon. Let's go... Over here!

478
00:51:41,034 --> 00:51:43,475
You did alright this time, flyboy.
How about it?

479
00:51:44,921 --> 00:51:48,215
- Whooooo peeeee!
- Over here.

480
00:52:04,748 --> 00:52:09,463
[Distorted Voice in P.A.] Now is the time to make
savers in our weekend sales department.

481
00:52:16,162 --> 00:52:17,667
Jesus Christ!

482
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:22,168
[Voice in P.A.] ...dining room fest
with a 40 by 60 burlap table...

483
00:52:22,169 --> 00:52:28,714
[Voice in P.A. keep talking]

484
00:52:28,715 --> 00:52:33,143
[Voice in P.A.] Why pay more when
the sales are open right here!

485
00:52:34,145 --> 00:52:36,367
We just gotta wait longer before we move.

486
00:52:36,368 --> 00:52:39,339
There's always the chance of some
of 'em stayin' up on the balcony.

487
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:41,324
We can handle that.
We can break through 'em.

488
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:45,267
If any of 'em see or hear us. They'll
just follow us up. It's not good.

489
00:52:45,268 --> 00:52:48,882
We can sure outrun 'em. Load up
what we can and get the hell outta here.

490
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:51,806
I've been thinking...

491
00:52:51,807 --> 00:52:53,671
Maybe we got a good thing going here...

492
00:52:53,672 --> 00:52:56,830
- Maybe we shouldn't be in such a hurry to leave.
- Oh, man!

493
00:52:56,831 --> 00:53:00,064
If we could get back up there
without them catchin' on...

494
00:53:00,065 --> 00:53:03,971
We could hold up for a while.
At least long enough to catch a breath.

495
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:06,202
Check out the radio. See what's happening'

496
00:53:06,203 --> 00:53:08,961
- Oh, man!
- There's some kind of passageway
over the top of the stores.

497
00:53:10,598 --> 00:53:12,996
I don't know if it's just heating
ducts or some kind of access.

498
00:53:14,837 --> 00:53:16,191
I saw 'em on a map.

499
00:53:18,748 --> 00:53:21,631
Upstairs... Let's go!

500
00:53:29,907 --> 00:53:30,810
Ceiling is just lighting grids!

501
00:53:32,145 --> 00:53:34,135
Is gotta be in this area.

502
00:53:34,136 --> 00:53:35,339
It's on the map!

503
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:36,566
Elevator shaft...

504
00:53:44,441 --> 00:53:45,439
Hold the doors!

505
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:59,355
It's here. You gonna need a screwdriver
or somethin' to stand on for down there.

506
00:53:59,356 --> 00:54:01,537
I know where the tools are.
Why don't you grab the stool over there?

507
00:54:11,367 --> 00:54:15,507
It's alright. We can get it off.
You found it, flyboy.

508
00:54:18,815 --> 00:54:21,956
One stop shopping. Anything you
need right at your fingertips.

509
00:54:22,118 --> 00:54:24,360
- Phillips?
- Here you go.

510
00:54:38,936 --> 00:54:40,089
Stephen?

511
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,358
Shit!

512
00:55:02,104 --> 00:55:03,690
[Roger] Jesus!

513
00:55:03,691 --> 00:55:05,368
I seen it. C'mon.

514
00:57:06,904 --> 00:57:09,431
Don't shoot! They'll hear it downstairs!

515
00:57:46,477 --> 00:57:48,223
Looks like we're gonna be ok.

516
00:57:54,445 --> 00:57:56,798
You should see all the great
stuff we got, Frannie.

517
00:57:56,799 --> 00:58:00,001
All kinds of stuff...
This place is terrific!

518
00:58:00,002 --> 00:58:05,319
It's really easy to pick the profit.
All kinds of things...

519
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,768
We really got it made in here... Frannie!

520
00:58:09,349 --> 00:58:10,866
Frannie?

521
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:23,195
What the hell time is it, anyway?

522
00:58:23,196 --> 00:58:24,821
Not quite nine.

523
00:58:24,822 --> 00:58:25,965
And nothing?

524
00:58:25,966 --> 00:58:28,623
As long as we're getting the pattern
that's means they're sending the signal.

525
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:45,437
[Voice over radio static] No longer seek occupancy
in private residences...

well protected they may be.

[The voice of radio fades out]

529
00:58:59,671 --> 00:59:01,579
[Peter] Is she alright?
She looks blunt.

530
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:04,994
- What do you expect?
- I mean, she really looks sick.

531
00:59:05,387 --> 00:59:06,453
Physically.

532
00:59:06,454 --> 00:59:07,332
She's pregnant.

Detroit had been knocked out ...

[Roger] How long?

535
00:59:15,737 --> 00:59:17,166
Three and half, maybe four months.

Jesus!

537
00:59:19,687 --> 00:59:21,870
Steve, maybe we should
try to get movin'

538
00:59:21,871 --> 00:59:22,962
We can deal with it.

539
00:59:22,963 --> 00:59:24,888
Yeah, but maybe she needs a
doctor or somethin'

540
00:59:24,889 --> 00:59:27,662
We can deal with it!
Doesn't change a thing.

[Peter] Do you wanna get
rid of it?

542
00:59:32,089 --> 00:59:35,799
- Huh?
- Do you want to abort?

543
00:59:37,177 --> 00:59:40,639
It's not too late.
And I know how.

How your decisions were made?

Do you want to abort it?

01:00:22,019 --> 01:00:23,399
Do you?

548
01:00:27,585 --> 01:00:29,570
Somebody better sit
watch all the time.

549
01:00:29,571 --> 01:00:31,124
They'll never get through there.

550
01:00:31,125 --> 01:00:35,458
Enough of 'em will. And ain't just
them things we got to worry about.

551
01:00:35,459 --> 01:00:40,424
That chopper up there could give us
away if somebody comes messin' around.

What are gonna do?
Land another pilot to fly it out.

They're not gonna mess with a little bird
like that. They got enough in their hands.

So, I guess we forget
about Canada, right?

[Voice on TV] ... normal question.
The first question is always ...

571
01:02:07,685 --> 01:02:10,886
... are these cannibals?
No, they're not cannibals ...

572
01:02:10,887 --> 01:02:16,278
... Cannibalism in the true sense of
the word implies an intraspecies activity ...

573

... these creatures cannot
be consider human ...

574

... they prey on humans.
they do not prey on each other! ...

575
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:29,504
... that's the difference. They attack...
They feed only on warm human flesh ...

... Intelligence? Seemingly little
or no reasoning power ...

remembered behaviours from normal life ...

... There are reports of these
creatures using tools ...

are the most primitive ...

as bludgeons and so forth ...

adopt the basic use of tools in this manner ...

582
01:02:56,888 --> 01:03:03,299
... These creatures are nothing but
pure motorised instinct ...

these are our family members or our friends ...

... of this whole phenomenon ...

with it in that way ...

specimens available ...

01:05:07,049 --> 01:05:09,995
I don't know about you two,
but I wanna learn how to fly that helicopter

620
01:05:12,881 --> 01:05:16,159
If anything happens to you,
we have to be able to fly out of here

621
01:05:17,448 --> 01:05:19,162
She's right, man

622
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:22,813
C'mon. Let's go.

623
01:05:25,477 --> 01:05:28,255
[Fran] And I don't want to believe
you're leaving me without a gun again

624
01:05:40,704 --> 01:05:43,178
I just might be able to
figure how to use it

625
01:05:46,388 --> 01:05:47,968
I'm sorry, Stephen

626
01:05:48,974 --> 01:05:50,583
It's alright. It's alright

627
01:05:51,254 --> 01:05:52,151
Stephen?

628
01:05:55,407 --> 01:05:56,315
Yeah?

629
01:05:57,838 --> 01:05:59,449
Be careful

630
01:06:01,325 --> 01:06:02,712
Yeah, we'll be alright

631
01:06:06,912 --> 01:06:11,191
[Host on TV] In spite of everything you hear here
there's still some people with a sense of humour

632
01:06:18,105 --> 01:06:19,740
How about it?

633
01:06:19,876 --> 01:06:20,955
Gettin' it

634
01:06:32,179 --> 01:06:34,574
I'm not too sure of this thing.
I'll just ride pick up

635
01:06:34,575 --> 01:06:36,528
I grew up on one of these.
C'mon, let's go!

636
01:06:36,529 --> 01:06:37,529
Alright!

637
01:07:10,834 --> 01:07:14,115
Hey, your tail is to slow too?
Come in.

638
01:07:14,813 --> 01:07:17,536
You look my size when you're
sitting in that truck

639
01:07:19,674 --> 01:07:23,103
Well, I wanna know is how if we've both
have the same force together...

640
01:07:23,104 --> 01:07:24,104
...yours be so enlarge?,
You know

641
01:07:24,105 --> 01:07:26,875
Well, they told me it was
a midget force...

642
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,714
They needed somebody
to look out you

643
01:07:29,853 --> 01:07:32,011
Hey, where's flyboy?
What's his twenty?

644
01:07:32,317 --> 01:07:35,178
I just hope he'll fly
off that roof or we fly zero!

645
01:07:45,556 --> 01:07:47,021
Ok, let's go! C'mon!

646
01:08:25,898 --> 01:08:27,090
C'mon, Roger, Come on!

647
01:08:28,691 --> 01:08:30,151
C'mon, c'mon, man!

648
01:09:16,746 --> 01:09:20,173
- Like a charm, uh? A Fucking charm!
- C'mon, man. Three more, baby!

649
01:09:59,219 --> 01:10:00,134
Roger!

650
01:10:07,374 --> 01:10:09,864
C'mon, look, man!

651
01:10:15,101 --> 01:10:16,101
Look!

652
01:11:18,296 --> 01:11:19,545
Get its head up...

653
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,331
Get its head up!

654
01:11:24,654 --> 01:11:26,384
Roger, get its head up, man!

655
01:11:51,495 --> 01:11:54,735
Get down! Stay down... I got it!

656
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:57,233
[Peter] Roger, move!

657
01:12:08,196 --> 01:12:09,674
Bastards

658
01:12:11,674 --> 01:12:13,824
You bastards

659
01:12:14,754 --> 01:12:15,997
Roger?

660
01:12:16,844 --> 01:12:18,091
We got 'em, buddy. Didn't we?

661
01:12:23,874 --> 01:12:26,563
We got this, man.
We got this by the ass!

662
01:12:32,229 --> 01:12:33,320
[Peter] Roger?!

663
01:12:33,564 --> 01:12:37,030
C'mon, man! Get your head together!
We got a lot to do!

664
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,902
Let's go, baby. Number two...

665
01:12:41,856 --> 01:12:43,044
You alright?

666
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:46,327
Perfect, baby. Perfect!

667
01:13:56,930 --> 01:13:58,508
Come on, here!

668
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,250
Let finish this. C'mon man!

669
01:14:22,369 --> 01:14:24,241
Roger, c'mon. C'mon man!

670
01:14:38,461 --> 01:14:41,476
Leave him, motherfuckers! Son of bitches!

671
01:14:54,854 --> 01:14:57,314
- Oh, God! Oh, Jesus!
- What?

672
01:14:58,552 --> 01:15:01,047
My bag. I left my goddam bag
in the other truck!

673
01:15:05,502 --> 01:15:08,338
Alright. You better screw
your head on.

674
01:15:08,339 --> 01:15:10,274
Yeah! C'mon, c'mon!
Let's go!

675
01:15:10,275 --> 01:15:16,002
I mean it, man! Now you're not just
playin' with your life, your playin' with mine!

676
01:15:16,555 --> 01:15:18,517
Now are you straight?

677
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:25,167
Yeah

678
01:15:47,109 --> 01:15:49,279
Go, go, go!

679
01:15:50,218 --> 01:15:52,309
C'mon, Roger, come on!

680
01:16:03,564 --> 01:16:04,916
Watch it, man!

681
01:16:05,813 --> 01:16:06,575
Watch out, watch out!

682
01:16:12,572 --> 01:16:16,394
Roger watch it!
Damn!

683
01:16:56,697 --> 01:16:58,322
That's it, man

684
01:17:01,921 --> 01:17:03,695
- That's it
- Bullshit!

685
01:17:03,696 --> 01:17:05,015
We gotta deal with that leg!

686
01:17:05,016 --> 01:17:07,535
I'm dealin' with it... I'm just dealin' with
it fine! Don't you worry, buddy!

687
01:17:10,935 --> 01:17:13,753
There's a lot to get done before
you can afford to lose me

688
01:17:25,148 --> 01:17:27,831
It all depends on how many of
them are still inside

689
01:17:27,832 --> 01:17:30,121
There's one hell of a run
we gotta make

690
01:17:30,122 --> 01:17:34,071
[Steven] If we have more flares,
or maybe some of those propane jobs

691
01:17:34,072 --> 01:17:37,292
Guns are first.
Guns and ammunition

692
01:17:51,126 --> 01:17:52,720
You sure you gonna make it?

693
01:17:55,874 --> 01:17:57,373
Just hurry up with that!

694
01:18:49,862 --> 01:18:51,593
[Peter] Don't try to shoot
through those gates

695
01:18:51,594 --> 01:18:55,841
Openings are too small. Bullet will
wind up chasin' us around in here

696
01:18:56,710 --> 01:18:58,423
Don't worry. They can't
get through

697
01:19:12,725 --> 01:19:14,954
- Ain't it a crime
- What?

698
01:19:14,955 --> 01:19:17,328
The only person who could
ever miss with gun...

699
01:19:17,329 --> 01:19:19,648
... is the sucker with the
bread to buy it.

700
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,840
[Peter] You just wait
out there, sissies...

701
01:19:26,841 --> 01:19:31,401
... we comin'
And we ready!

702
01:20:05,354 --> 01:20:07,154
OK, let's go!

703
01:20:36,335 --> 01:20:38,689
OK, the door is open.
Push, push!

704
01:20:38,690 --> 01:20:40,314
That's it! Push! That's it!

705
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:56,683
We're inside. C'mon, let's go!

706
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:07,445
Hardware

707
01:21:09,223 --> 01:21:10,607
Look here, man... I'm ...

708
01:21:10,608 --> 01:21:12,382
I know, shut up. Will you

709
01:21:26,174 --> 01:21:29,208
[Peter] Alright. The toughest part
will be gettin' by these right here

710
01:21:29,209 --> 01:21:30,528
It's too far

711
01:21:30,529 --> 01:21:32,644
There's no backing up now

712
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:34,605
We gotta lock those main doors

713
01:21:34,606 --> 01:21:37,178
We'll never make all four entrances.
It's too risky

714
01:21:37,179 --> 01:21:40,251
We'll make it. You just
be ready to open up for us

715
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,540
[Fran] Wait a minute!
The car!

716
01:21:44,541 --> 01:21:45,079
What?

717
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:48,377
One of those car? Why don't
you use the car over there?

718
01:21:53,284 --> 01:21:54,692
[Peter] You OK to start it?

719
01:21:55,437 --> 01:21:56,437
OK, let's go

720
01:22:08,672 --> 01:22:10,578
Close the door. Close the door!

721
01:22:13,966 --> 01:22:15,743
The keys, Stephen... The keys!

722
01:22:27,356 --> 01:22:29,104
C'mon, man.
Get out of there!

723
01:22:30,891 --> 01:22:32,055
God dammit!

724
01:22:32,056 --> 01:22:33,618
Keep 'em! Just keep 'em!

725
01:22:33,619 --> 01:22:35,582
Lock yourself in there!

726
01:23:44,465 --> 01:23:45,554
Jump in the back!

727
01:23:55,849 --> 01:23:57,668
- You alright?
- Yeah

728
01:24:24,073 --> 01:24:26,764
- Keep 'em at large and I'll do the lock
- Gotcha!

729
01:24:41,495 --> 01:24:45,228
That's not 100%, but I don't
think they'll get through

730
01:24:45,229 --> 01:24:46,744
Can't they smash the glass?

731
01:24:46,745 --> 01:24:49,335
Safety stuff.
Pretty indestructible

732
01:24:49,336 --> 01:24:51,553
They got no leverage under the truck

733
01:24:51,554 --> 01:24:54,084
I hopin' they'll just go away
after they find they can't get in

734
01:24:54,694 --> 01:24:57,316
I'll get the alarms.
You get in the car

735
01:25:13,524 --> 01:25:16,975
We're OK. We got it made.
It's gonna work

736
01:25:46,338 --> 01:25:48,041
How many you figure are already in?

737
01:25:48,042 --> 01:25:50,248
I don't know.
Not too many

738
01:25:50,249 --> 01:25:52,232
We'll get 'em easy

739
01:25:52,233 --> 01:25:56,292
We get it all locked off.
Then we're goin' on a hunt!

740
01:27:40,155 --> 01:27:41,917
We put up the wall here

741
01:27:41,918 --> 01:27:43,640
This way we can still
get to the plumbing

742
01:27:43,641 --> 01:27:45,734
Why can't we just
board up the stairway?

743
01:27:45,735 --> 01:27:48,784
Sooner or later, it might
be a patrol through here

744
01:27:48,785 --> 01:27:50,783
Looters maybe...

745
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:54,139
I don't want anybody to
even know that stairway exists

746
01:28:22,908 --> 01:28:24,880
I don't know what else to do?

747
01:28:25,492 --> 01:28:27,176
You're doin' fine

748
01:28:28,323 --> 01:28:31,150
His leg is awful.
The infection is spreading quickly

749
01:28:32,116 --> 01:28:34,634
Can't we do somethin'?
Can't we take him to a Med Unit?

750
01:28:34,847 --> 01:28:39,568
[Peter] I've seen half a dozen
guys get bitten by those things...

751
01:28:39,569 --> 01:28:43,579
None of 'em lasted more
than three days

752
01:28:46,894 --> 01:28:48,320
[Roger] Peter where are you?

753
01:28:49,584 --> 01:28:51,043
Right here, trooper

754
01:28:53,386 --> 01:28:55,916
We did it, didn't we?

755
01:28:55,916 --> 01:28:57,592
We whip 'em, didn't we?

756
01:28:57,593 --> 01:28:59,566
That's right Rog

757
01:28:59,567 --> 01:29:04,128
Didn't we? Didn't we whip 'em?

758
01:29:04,129 --> 01:29:05,851
We sure did, buddy

759
01:29:05,852 --> 01:29:10,338
We whipped 'em.
We whipped 'em good.

760
01:29:10,339 --> 01:29:14,132
We whipped 'em!
We got it all!

761
01:29:57,270 --> 01:29:59,714
Leave me alone. It's alright
It's my problem

762
01:29:59,715 --> 01:30:03,216
Just get out of here.
I don't want you here!

763
01:30:06,890 --> 01:30:10,364
I just don't want you
to see me like this

764
01:30:11,641 --> 01:30:13,914
Stephen get out. Please!

765
01:30:27,754 --> 01:30:30,994
This place is gonna be rotten

766
01:30:32,321 --> 01:30:34,733
We gotta cleaning up, brother

767
01:31:48,484 --> 01:31:50,758
You never know

768
01:33:21,085 --> 01:33:22,441
What do you think?

769
01:33:25,381 --> 01:33:26,881
Watch this!

770
01:34:57,655 --> 01:34:59,538
They're still here

771
01:34:59,539 --> 01:35:03,290
They're after us.
They know we're still in here

772
01:35:03,291 --> 01:35:04,994
They're after the place...

773
01:35:04,995 --> 01:35:09,261
They don't know why.
They just remember

774
01:35:09,262 --> 01:35:11,584
Remember that they
wanna be in here

775
01:35:11,585 --> 01:35:13,371
What the hell are they?

776
01:35:13,372 --> 01:35:17,702
They're us, that's all.
There's no more room in Hell

777
01:35:18,668 --> 01:35:20,417
What?

778
01:35:20,418 --> 01:35:23,079
Something' my granddad
used to tell us

779
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:27,669
You know Macumba?
Voodoo...

780
01:35:27,670 --> 01:35:33,213
Granddaddy was a priest in Trinidad.
Used to tell us...

781
01:35:33,214 --> 01:35:35,975
When there's no more
room in Hell...

782
01:35:35,976 --> 01:35:39,121
The dead will walk the Earth

783
01:35:51,935 --> 01:35:53,742
Got him! Hurry up! C'mon!

784
01:36:33,805 --> 01:36:37,503
Go on... I'll stay with him

785
01:37:00,086 --> 01:37:02,560
You'll take care of me,
wouldn't you, Peter?

786
01:37:05,166 --> 01:37:07,555
You'll take care of me...
when I go

787
01:37:07,556 --> 01:37:10,850
Try to get some sleep.
Save your strength

788
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:18,314
I don't wanna be walkin'
around like that

789
01:37:20,332 --> 01:37:22,278
Peter?

790
01:37:23,833 --> 01:37:24,833
Peter?!!

791
01:37:24,834 --> 01:37:25,834
Yeah, I'm here man!

792
01:37:32,074 --> 01:37:35,970
Don't do it, till you're sure
I am comin' back

793
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:45,554
I'm gonna try not to...

794
01:37:45,555 --> 01:37:50,458
I'm gonna try not to...
come back

795
01:37:50,459 --> 01:37:54,225
I'm gonna try...

796
01:37:56,358 --> 01:38:00,006
... not to.

797
01:38:00,007 --> 01:38:03,306
[Scientist] They use...
maybe...

798
01:38:03,307 --> 01:38:06,021
five percent of the food
available on the human body

799
01:38:06,022 --> 01:38:08,175
[TV Host] ... the kind of things...

800
01:38:08,176 --> 01:38:12,817
...with that food amount, the body
is usually intact enough

801
01:38:12,818 --> 01:38:14,372
...to be mobile when it revives

802
01:38:14,373 --> 01:38:16,428
[TV Host] What are you saying?
I mean... You scientists...

803
01:38:16,429 --> 01:38:19,129
- Dummies, dummies!
- What are you suggesting?

804
01:38:19,130 --> 01:38:23,339
[TV Host] Excuse me.
Listen, quiet! Quiet!

805
01:38:24,245 --> 01:38:26,725
[Scientist] One wonders what
is worth saving...

806
01:38:26,726 --> 01:38:28,258
...which is I do

807
01:38:29,030 --> 01:38:31,743
[Scientist] For all I know...
The brain is already dead...

808
01:38:31,744 --> 01:38:33,606
....is the idiots who still alive

809
01:38:35,583 --> 01:38:37,761
Can I speak it up how
to stay alive too?

810
01:38:37,762 --> 01:38:40,363
And I'm tryin' to help
you gentlemen

811
01:38:40,364 --> 01:38:43,068
[TV Host] And you can help.
But what you do take...

812
01:38:43,069 --> 01:38:46,069
[Scientist] - In a logical way...!
[TV Host] - ...is illogical!

813
01:38:46,070 --> 01:38:47,986
[Scientist] Illogical hell!

814
01:38:47,987 --> 01:38:53,677
Illogical hell! I'm showing you a way
that we can opt...

815
01:38:53,678 --> 01:38:56,422
... to pull supplies twenty times!

816
01:38:58,494 --> 01:39:00,232
To pull supplies for whom?

817
01:39:00,233 --> 01:39:03,212
For a whole specimen that is
walking around there...

818
01:39:03,213 --> 01:39:06,127
-... in increasing numbers.
[TV Host] - We should feed 'em?

819
01:39:06,128 --> 01:39:07,659
[Scientist] What else we
should with 'em?

820
01:39:07,660 --> 01:39:09,714
Gimme an alternative!

821
01:39:09,715 --> 01:39:12,400
[TV Host] I thought you
scientists can come up with that?

822
01:39:12,401 --> 01:39:18,084
... actually, that way solve the problem of growing.
Feeding the opposition doesn't make any sense!

823
01:39:18,085 --> 01:39:20,914
Well I can think on one alternative

824
01:39:20,915 --> 01:39:22,641
I can think on another one, yes.

825
01:39:22,642 --> 01:39:26,995
Since they seem to congregate
in heavily populated areas...

826
01:39:26,996 --> 01:39:30,332
and since we haven`t touch
upon our nuclear resources

827
01:39:30,333 --> 01:39:32,474
why don't we drop a bomb
in all the big cities?

828
01:39:32,475 --> 01:39:35,177
[TV host] - You probably can't be serious?
[Scientist] - I'm deadly serious! What are the choices?

829
01:39:35,178 --> 01:39:40,031
- What if they run out of food?
- They don't run out of food. That's the problem!

830
01:39:40,032 --> 01:39:43,007
And they won't run out of
food while we still alive

831
01:39:43,008 --> 01:39:46,850
This kind of things, you know,
things that we're talking about here...

832
01:39:46,851 --> 01:39:50,636
...sounds like just a bunch of
people talking crazy

833
01:39:50,637 --> 01:39:53,038
- This is not fighting...!
- ... without actually picture it out!

834
01:39:53,039 --> 01:39:56,239
[Scientist] This is not the
republic against the democrats...

835
01:39:56,240 --> 01:40:00,657
...that got us in a hole economically.
Or lead us to another war!

836
01:40:00,658 --> 01:40:04,243
... is more crucial that we go
down to the line, folks

837
01:40:04,559 --> 01:40:10,898
...we're down to the line. There are
no divisions upon 'em and the living...

838
01:40:10,899 --> 01:40:15,293
[TV host] At least... At
least let him finish, please!

839
01:40:16,309 --> 01:40:18,432
It`s really all over, isn't it?

840
01:40:18,433 --> 01:40:21,158
[Scientist] ...unemotional!

841
01:40:22,750 --> 01:40:25,671
...we got to remain rational

842
01:40:25,672 --> 01:40:33,772
- Logical... logical
- Scientist always think in those kinda turns...

843
01:40:33,773 --> 01:40:37,296
...if it doesn't work that way
that's not how people really are

844
01:40:37,297 --> 01:40:41,327
[Scientist] You've got
to remain logical. We've got to.

845
01:40:41,328 --> 01:40:45,295
There's no choice.
It has to be.

846
01:40:45,296 --> 01:40:48,398
It's gonna be that!

847
01:41:20,209 --> 01:41:21,251
[Peter] Here it comes!

848
01:41:24,677 --> 01:41:27,937
- Oh nice!
- Wow!

849
01:41:27,938 --> 01:41:32,138
- Bon appétit!
- thank you!

850
01:41:32,139 --> 01:41:37,412
- Stephen?
- Thank you very much!

851
01:41:40,747 --> 01:41:42,962
Peter, what about you?
Where you goin'?

852
01:41:42,963 --> 01:41:46,032
This is just for the two of you

853
01:41:52,172 --> 01:41:54,128
Enjoy

854
01:42:49,097 --> 01:42:51,353
We can't Stephen. Not now

855
01:42:53,656 --> 01:42:55,033
But we will...

856
01:44:25,191 --> 01:44:27,716
Hey, when you finish the rove,
we wrapped it up the drugstore

857
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:04,504
[P.A. Voice] Attention, all shoppers...

858
01:47:04,505 --> 01:47:10,763
...if you have a 32,
we have a special treat for you...

859
01:47:10,764 --> 01:47:14,487
...if your purchase is in the
next half an hour

860
01:47:14,488 --> 01:47:17,416
...with an amount of
five dollars or more

861
01:47:17,417 --> 01:47:23,300
...we'll give you a bag
of Hard Candy free!

862
01:48:26,014 --> 01:48:29,160
There hasn't been a broadcast
for three days. Why don't you give it up?

863
01:48:31,335 --> 01:48:33,841
They might come back on

864
01:49:16,706 --> 01:49:20,349
What have we done
to ourselves?

865
01:49:48,995 --> 01:49:51,910
OK, now easy... easy

866
01:49:55,333 --> 01:49:57,280
Stabilise it. That's right!

867
01:49:59,459 --> 01:50:03,213
Bring 'er down. Down, down.

868
01:50:06,273 --> 01:50:09,666
That's it! You got it!

869
01:50:10,272 --> 01:50:14,473
- Hon, you got it!
- Yeah, I did it!

870
01:50:18,781 --> 01:50:21,352
- Wow!
- They must get in through the roof

871
01:50:21,353 --> 01:50:22,683
Son of a bitch!

872
01:50:22,684 --> 01:50:26,363
- They have trucks blockin' all the entrances
- Yeah, trucks!

873
01:50:26,364 --> 01:50:28,854
No sweat!

874
01:50:28,855 --> 01:50:30,700
What do you think?

875
01:50:30,701 --> 01:50:33,395
Hit 'em now or tonight?

876
01:50:34,296 --> 01:50:36,594
Tonight

877
01:50:41,746 --> 01:50:46,247
[Voice on radio] Hey, we know you in there?
seen the helicopter on the roof...

878
01:50:53,267 --> 01:50:56,520
... how many of you in there?

879
01:50:59,606 --> 01:51:02,015
We know you're up there.
We seen the whirlybird on the roof

880
01:51:02,016 --> 01:51:06,234
Hey you guys shut up.
Cut it! Shut up!

881
01:51:06,235 --> 01:51:07,497
[Peter] Raiders

882
01:51:07,498 --> 01:51:11,867
Could ya use some company
up there?

883
01:51:15,338 --> 01:51:18,671
- They know we're here, maybe we should...
- No chance

884
01:51:18,672 --> 01:51:22,378
Oh, change your mind...
Do you wanna try?

885
01:51:22,379 --> 01:51:24,875
Alright, cut. Cut, cut!

886
01:51:24,876 --> 01:51:32,034
Listen... How many of you in
there, anyway... there's three of us

887
01:51:33,969 --> 01:51:35,916
- What if...
- Quiet!

888
01:51:35,917 --> 01:51:39,442
- I think we should...
- Jesus Christ! Shut up and listen

889
01:51:39,443 --> 01:51:45,306
We don't like people who don't share.
You just fucked up real bad!

890
01:51:49,158 --> 01:51:50,481
Let's go

891
01:52:22,623 --> 01:52:23,681
[Biker] It's time.
Let's go

892
01:52:39,293 --> 01:52:42,984
[Peter] Just three, huh?

893
01:52:43,493 --> 01:52:45,456
Holy shit!

894
01:52:49,812 --> 01:52:53,118
They'll get in. They'll
move the trucks

895
01:52:53,517 --> 01:52:55,363
There's hundreds of those
creatures down there

896
01:52:55,364 --> 01:52:57,840
C'mon man, that's a
professional army

897
01:52:57,841 --> 01:53:01,815
Looks like they been survivin'
on the road all through this thing

898
01:53:01,816 --> 01:53:07,736
Well let's not make
it easy for 'em. Come on!

899
01:53:13,574 --> 01:53:14,692
What's happening?

900
01:53:14,693 --> 01:53:17,270
There's fifteen or twenty of 'em.
We're gonna shut off the gates

901
01:53:17,271 --> 01:53:19,400
- Stephen
- We're just gonna shut the gates

902
01:53:19,401 --> 01:53:21,008
They'll never know
we're here

903
01:53:35,343 --> 01:53:38,254
Downstairs first.
Got your talk box?

904
01:53:38,255 --> 01:53:39,639
- Yeah
- Keep it handy

905
01:54:53,005 --> 01:54:57,995
Shit... It's all taped up.
It's all ready for us

906
01:54:57,996 --> 01:55:02,524
What the hell are they doing? There's a
whole fucking glass latch and won't open!

907
01:55:02,525 --> 01:55:05,340
Yeah, everyone fucking
thinks like, Joe

908
01:55:06,603 --> 01:55:10,133
Hey, the whole damn gate
locks won't open

909
01:55:10,134 --> 01:55:12,550
Let's go blow the
goddamned gate locks!

910
01:55:12,551 --> 01:55:14,202
Watch that guy with the machine gun,
you won't believe it!

911
01:55:16,111 --> 01:55:17,122
Watch out, dude!

912
01:55:35,471 --> 01:55:38,064
They're in, flyboy.
They're opening the outer locks

913
01:55:53,058 --> 01:55:58,376
When those doors will open, there's
gonna be a thousand zombies in here

914
01:55:58,377 --> 01:56:02,584
They're gonna have their
hands full

915
01:56:20,136 --> 01:56:22,122
Just let 'em fire it up!

916
01:56:22,123 --> 01:56:24,407
Get up on the balcony.
Stay out of sight.

917
01:56:24,408 --> 01:56:27,674
I'll meet you...
at the Information room

918
01:56:50,052 --> 01:56:53,567
Alright guys, look out for yourselves.
It's good for us. Let's go!

919
01:58:12,218 --> 01:58:13,635
Hey you there!

920
01:58:15,024 --> 01:58:16,423
Hello

921
01:58:32,487 --> 01:58:34,293
Flyboy?

922
01:58:35,554 --> 01:58:37,224
Flyboy?

923
01:58:37,603 --> 01:58:39,456
Flyboy, where the hell
are you?

924
01:58:57,574 --> 01:58:58,855
C'mon man, you're too slow!

925
01:59:07,459 --> 01:59:11,492
It's ours.
We took it

926
01:59:11,493 --> 01:59:13,488
It's ours.

927
01:59:28,650 --> 01:59:31,694
What the hell are you doing playin' around,
let's go upstairs and doin' him

928
01:59:32,735 --> 01:59:36,040
Goddammit Flyboy,
what the hell are you doing?

929
01:59:55,160 --> 01:59:56,404
[Peter] Just stay out of sight!

930
01:59:56,405 --> 01:59:58,656
They're after the place,
they don't care about us!

931
02:00:07,345 --> 02:00:10,731
Alright, dammit!
Now we got a war!

932
02:00:21,522 --> 02:00:23,289
Say goodbye creep

933
02:02:11,281 --> 02:02:13,779
Where the hell are you
gonna watch that thing?

934
02:02:13,780 --> 02:02:15,092
You alright, man

935
02:02:36,697 --> 02:02:38,698
He's upstairs. Let's go!

936
02:02:54,168 --> 02:02:56,066
C'mon, mother...

937
02:03:03,417 --> 02:03:05,687
- Where he go?
- I don't know. Come on!

938
02:03:24,754 --> 02:03:26,693
I see you!

939
02:03:44,294 --> 02:03:47,313
Peter? Peter?!

940
02:03:53,023 --> 02:03:55,632
Peter!

941
02:04:26,876 --> 02:04:29,754
- I know he's in there!
- Come on!

942
02:04:31,178 --> 02:04:36,764
Hey you! I see you up there!

943
02:04:36,765 --> 02:04:39,306
C'mon, let's go!
Let's get out of here

944
02:05:07,744 --> 02:05:09,899
Son of a bitch!

945
02:05:12,885 --> 02:05:14,511
C'mon man. Let's get
the hell out of here

946
02:06:38,714 --> 02:06:41,324
Peter? Peter are you there?

947
02:06:41,325 --> 02:06:42,708
Where the hell are you?

948
02:06:42,709 --> 02:06:43,870
The elevator

949
02:06:43,871 --> 02:06:47,125
Those things are all over the place.
Climb up top...

950
02:06:47,126 --> 02:06:50,052
I'll get you out the
grid on the shaft

951
02:06:50,053 --> 02:06:54,089
I'm coming

952
02:08:06,855 --> 02:08:10,424
Flyboy? Flyboy!

953
02:09:37,338 --> 02:09:39,488
Stephen?

954
02:09:39,489 --> 02:09:43,358
I heard his gun...
may he's alright

955
02:09:49,138 --> 02:09:56,053
We'll just wait...
We'll just wait a while

956
02:10:24,563 --> 02:10:26,674
It's almost light.
Let's go

957
02:10:28,441 --> 02:10:31,669
He doesn't answer the
radio for hours

958
02:10:35,761 --> 02:10:37,861
For God sake!

959
02:12:44,652 --> 02:12:50,759
- What is it?
- Stephen...

960
02:12:49,340 --> 02:12:51,018
They're coming up

961
02:13:05,605 --> 02:13:07,528
Go on... get out of here

962
02:13:12,280 --> 02:13:14,991
- Peter?
- I said... get out of here

963
02:13:17,489 --> 02:13:21,195
- Oh, Jesus Christ, Peter...
- I don't want to go

964
02:13:23,953 --> 02:13:27,556
I really don't

965
02:13:59,252 --> 02:14:00,495
Come on!

966
02:14:00,496 --> 02:14:04,417
Get there! Move woman!

967
02:17:06,864 --> 02:17:10,012
How much fuel do we have?

968
02:17:08,357 --> 02:17:11,909
Not much

969
02:17:14,127 --> 02:17:15,361
Alright

970
02:17:37,180 --> 02:17:42,180
