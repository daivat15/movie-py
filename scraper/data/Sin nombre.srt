1
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:21,892
Miss.

2
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:25,103
What do you want?

3
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,481
I told you not to come here to bother Benito.

4
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:29,107
Benito!

5
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,487
You are a criminal and my
baby won't be a criminal like you.

6
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,115
Benito is not coming out!

7
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,911
Or I'll call the police to take you to jail,
that's what you want, you asshole.

8
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:41,870
Grandma.

9
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,207
You shut up and go back inside!

10
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,212
You aren't going out I told you,
don't you understand spanish

11
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,022
Let this be our secret my friend...

12
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,316
...keep the secret here, ok?

13
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,116
Lil' Mago wants to see you.

14
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,132
One...

15
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,222
Two...

16
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,852
Three...

17
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,521
Four...

18
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:54,735
Five...

19
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:58,739
Six...

20
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,450
Seven...

21
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,244
Eight...

22
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,121
Nine...

23
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:08,957
Ten...

24
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:11,543
Eleven...

25
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:13,754
Twelve...

26
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,051
Twelve...

27
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:23,347
Twelve... Twelve...

28
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,935
...Thirteen.

29
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,251
Congratulations little Homie!

30
00:04:54,044 --> 00:05:00,551
Casper, look at the kids smile.

31
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,224
The gang who controls "Salvatrucha" gang.

32
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,531
Your dad is waiting for you.

33
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:27,494
Look, I know why you
want to do this trip, but...

34
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,998
...I don't know why I have to do it.

35
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,628
If you don't want to go,
grandma can not make you go, but...

36
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,631
...my brother won't come back for you again.

37
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:46,722
Look, I don't need anyone, I can go
to the north by myself if I wanted to.

38
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:55,647
Come with us, it won't be easy over
there, but at least we will be together.

39
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,569
There is nothing for you here, Sayra.

40
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,779
Nothing.

41
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:21,340
She is here.

42
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:31,183
Damn, if I didn't know I wouldn't recognize her.

43
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:41,276
She is a lady now.

44
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,322
Now you can recover your lost time.

45
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:48,742
We will do that on the way mother.

46
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:54,373
Tomorrow before sunrise we will grab the bus.

47
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:57,334
Don't worry, she will be ready.

48
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:06,593
"The Bombilla" Tapachula, Southern Mexico.

49
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,764
Here is Lucrecia with her products.

50
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:15,894
Casper, how have you been, now you
are a pederast?, the smaller the more idiots.

51
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:19,273
Look how you beat him up, you are a barbarian.

52
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:22,484
Tortillas, coffee, baleadas,soups!

53
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,876
Thank you!

54
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,765
Slow baby, slow..

55
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,572
Stop it.

56
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,630
Martha Marlene.

57
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,760
I am bored.

58
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:54,761
why?

59
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:58,140
Can you take me somewhere?

60
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,767
Where do you want to go?

61
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:09,735
I don't know, wherever you want to,
where you go when you are not here.

62
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,324
You have another girl in your neighborhood, right?

63
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:16,533
Of course not.

64
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,829
You better not, because if I
realize that you have other girl...

65
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:28,921
What?

66
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:30,506
It shrinked...

67
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,468
Oh, it's normal, look...

68
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:36,970
...now it will be refreshed.

69
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,643
Do you think she will have a friend for me?

70
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,316
Be careful my friend "Smiley"...

71
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,070
...don't say anything that
we left from the "Bombilla"

72
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,073
Don't say anything at all,
so Lil' Mago won't notice.

73
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,782
Ok?

74
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:58,367
Yes.

75
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,160
Not a fucking word!

76
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:11,171
Little Homie, you will first earn your letters,
hitting on a "Kiddo"...

77
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:16,635
...then after that, you will conquer a girl.

78
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,475
Welcome to the destroyer.

79
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:26,478
- What's up, homie?
- Cool, brother.

80
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,407
What's up Casper you dog!

81
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,619
What, did he kill a "kiddo" yet, uh?

82
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:50,169
This is the "Naughty" and the "Smoky"...

83
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:54,798
...they just arrived, they come and
go to see what's going on here.

84
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:57,801
They are "Guanacos".
Are you thirsty?

85
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,908
This guy is "gold" we call him "the buttocks"...

86
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,746
...and this is the "Querubin".

87
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,753
He can't sit, his ass is bleeding...

88
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:36,673
...he has hemorroids.

89
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:58,862
This you have to earn it...
for the moment you have to share.

90
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:01,406
What's for the gang is for the gang.

91
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:13,794
He is the one that has the second voice.

92
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:18,048
Hey, my dogs are here.

93
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:23,720
How was it?

94
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:26,431
Did you go to the "Bombilla"?

95
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:31,144
Yes, but we didn't find anything.

96
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:41,446
The "Sol" found him with
another group of "chickens"...

97
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:43,574
...in the "Bombilla".

98
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,202
Take him out.

99
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:53,834
Don't worry, nothing is happening,
now that dog that scares you will die.

100
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:06,638
You fucked up "Kiddo",
you got in the train of the gang.

101
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:13,604
I'm only going to the north, please, please!

102
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:18,567
You are already worthless you fucker...

103
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:23,697
...we will cut you in 18 pieces
and we will feed the dogs.

104
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:28,994
I have a family...
and I'm not a gangster anymore.

105
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:39,046
"kiddo" will always be a "kiddo"

106
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,677
Casper, give "Smiley" a hand.

107
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:49,973
Both of you, get him.

108
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:03,153
Point to his head.

109
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,864
This is for the fallen Homies, you fucker.

110
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:07,574
To the count of three...

111
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:09,284
One...

112
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:10,786
Two...

113
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:12,412
...Three.

114
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:42,109
The first time is like this
little Homie, don't chicken out.

115
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:49,741
The scareness goes away,
but the gang is forever.

116
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:57,958
Now you belong to a family
with thousands of brothers...

117
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:04,089
...wherever you go, there will
always be someone that protects you

118
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,348
Food is here!

119
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,410
You were not in the "Bombilla" today.

120
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:36,914
The "Sol" didn't see you.

121
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:42,794
I was there the whole day,
and I didn't see him neither.

122
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,549
You are not playing gay, right Homie?

123
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:56,141
It has been many times already,
now the "Sol" didn't see you.

124
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:02,898
Forget what I said Homie...

125
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:07,027
...the homies are getting altered.

126
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,949
I love you dog, from my heart.

127
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:19,540
3 days later.

128
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:29,299
9085550187... again.

129
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:34,847
we learned it already.

130
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:36,223
repeat it.

131
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:37,724
I told you we learned it already.

132
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:43,355
you have to learn that number, if something
goes wrong, Yessenia can help you out.

133
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:47,276
Horacio, how much time left man?

134
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:49,862
Around 6 hours.

135
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:51,989
Are you tired?

136
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,448
Yes.

137
00:17:56,285 --> 00:18:00,873
You have to see it as an adventure brother,
we are going to an adventure.

138
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:06,128
repeat the number one more time.

139
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:29,067
Guatemala-México Border.

140
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:51,757
Welcome to México.

141
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:54,718
Your documents.

142
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,554
You don't have, right?
everyone come this way.

143
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:10,859
First you are going to empty your pockets
and take out everything that has some value...

144
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:17,199
...after that, take off your clothes and put it
in front of you... start with the shoes.

145
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,338
We walked too much!

146
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:15,966
We need to buy some water for her...

147
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:17,676
With what money?

148
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:28,145
Bring two big bottles.

149
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:48,040
Your second toe is bigger than the others...

150
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,959
...that means you run fast.

151
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:06,975
This is what we have walked today.

152
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:11,730
If there is no immigration
we will be here in two weeks.

153
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:14,942
- Two weeks?
- Maybe three.

154
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:20,531
Where is New Jersey?

155
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:24,326
It's not in the map.

156
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:31,625
Look, not even half of them will arrive to the U.S.

157
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:38,966
...but we are going to get there.

158
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:51,061
Yessenia is not as pretty as your Mom was...

159
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:54,606
...but she has a big heart.

160
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:56,900
The girls are beautiful.

161
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:06,535
Keep it, now they are your family also.

162
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:09,079
I don't want a picture of your family.

163
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:16,628
You are taking me in this trip,
and I thank you for that.

164
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:28,849
I will go call home.

165
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:48,368
Look at him,
I remember him more handsome.

166
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:51,872
No, the handsome one in the family is me.

167
00:22:57,085 --> 00:23:01,089
Don't tell me you are not a little happy.

168
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:03,342
If he was not deported, he wouldn't be here.

169
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:06,470
- Don't think in that bullshit.
- It's not bullshit.

170
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:55,519
Do you see that train?

171
00:23:57,646 --> 00:24:03,902
That's our train, what do you say if
we grab it and go all the way to Texas?

172
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:07,948
I can take you to six flags.

173
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:21,545
Tell me one more time that you love me.

174
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:24,423
I love you.

175
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:28,844
Tell me that you won't hide me anymore.

176
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:31,597
It's not that.

177
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:33,974
Of course, you hide from me.

178
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:40,314
You already know all that is worth it.

179
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,901
Martha Marlene.

180
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:46,695
Martha Marlene.

181
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:56,788
You think I don't realize what you
do the whole day with your friends?

182
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,709
You get high with other girls,
and fool around the whole day.

183
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:02,586
Homies you two go to the trains.

184
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:11,553
Casper, Smiley.

185
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:13,138
What's up "Sol"?

186
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:19,019
What's up?

187
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:21,605
Who is this girl?

188
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:25,192
Martha Marlene, he is the "Sol".

189
00:25:29,488 --> 00:25:30,906
Is she your girl?

190
00:25:31,532 --> 00:25:33,867
No, she is just a friend.

191
00:25:39,832 --> 00:25:44,461
We have meeting tomorrow
at the cemetery, in the afternoon.

192
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:47,339
Be careful, ok?

193
00:25:53,595 --> 00:26:00,269
Hey, be aware Homie,
the entrance is full of "kiddos"...

194
00:26:00,978 --> 00:26:03,272
...who knows who is sneaking in with the people.

195
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:13,407
I'll take you home.

196
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:15,826
Friend... you idiot.

197
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:19,872
Homie, wait here Smiley.

198
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,165
Wait for me.

199
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:50,485
Let's go.

200
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:07,187
There will be no train.

201
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:10,148
The train went off the rail ahead,
there were many dead people.

202
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:11,483
Where did you hear that?

203
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:14,444
Some "Salvadorians" told me.

204
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:22,953
There will be no train!

205
00:28:57,446 --> 00:29:01,783
We need more money to buy the
defense for the homies that are in jail.

206
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:05,829
finally, some Homies have
screwed up in their obligations...

207
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:08,457
...and the "kiddos" are getting in the territory.

208
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:13,795
We cannot allow those dogs bringing
their garbage in the neighborhood...

209
00:29:14,171 --> 00:29:16,840
There will be "cut" for Casper and Smiley.

210
00:29:19,218 --> 00:29:20,135
They fooled me...

211
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:25,390
...and you know that you cant lie to the leader...
worst, lie to the neighborhood.

212
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:29,186
Now I want to hear your version.

213
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,106
Where did you go after the "Bombilla"?

214
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:39,822
Smiley, where did you go?

215
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:45,619
Ok, your gun.

216
00:29:57,589 --> 00:29:59,508
that's all.

217
00:30:00,175 --> 00:30:03,220
"Salvatrucha" gang, the gang who
controls the "Salvatrucha" gang.

218
00:30:19,403 --> 00:30:20,696
What are you doing here?

219
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:22,489
You have to go!

220
00:30:22,698 --> 00:30:23,824
Now!

221
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:27,494
Why? is it a private party?

222
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:31,790
What's up Casper? who is this girl?

223
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:33,333
A friend.

224
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:34,668
From where?

225
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:37,629
I am from downtown.

226
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:41,466
Oh, sorry, I confused you.

227
00:30:41,592 --> 00:30:42,885
I was going to take her to the exit.

228
00:30:43,427 --> 00:30:44,094
No.

229
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:50,601
It won't take time Homie.

230
00:30:51,143 --> 00:30:52,728
If you want I can take her...

231
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:56,440
...or she can stay and watch.

232
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,901
But you don't go anywhere Homie.

233
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:06,533
Take her directly to her house Homie.

234
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:30,974
13 seconds of cut for being a liar.

235
00:31:31,308 --> 00:31:32,601
One...

236
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:36,146
Two... Three...

237
00:31:38,273 --> 00:31:41,235
Smiley, you also have 13 seconds
for not saying anything against Casper.

238
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:53,914
This is the largest tree in Tapachula, if you
go to the top, you can see very far away.

239
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,752
Why Willie couldn't come?

240
00:31:59,461 --> 00:32:00,546
Willie?

241
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:05,384
Do you refer to Casper?

242
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:14,059
Ohh, I get it now.

243
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:26,363
You are the reason for him being abscent.

244
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:32,244
Sit down, I want to talk to you.

245
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:42,462
Closer.

246
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:45,966
Closer.

247
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:53,557
Don't be shy, I won't bite you.

248
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:57,895
So...

249
00:33:02,024 --> 00:33:04,026
...you and Casper are more than friends.

250
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:12,993
I have to go.

251
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,795
Has he told you anything about us?

252
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:36,600
Do you know what are the most
important rules to keep a friendship?

253
00:33:39,645 --> 00:33:46,693
Honesty, respect, and generosity.

254
00:34:23,355 --> 00:34:26,441
hey girl...

255
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:55,846
Where is Martha Marlene?

256
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:58,640
She left.

257
00:34:59,141 --> 00:35:00,851
To her house?

258
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:05,272
The beast took her.

259
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:16,909
You will find another one.

260
00:35:40,098 --> 00:35:42,768
We are going to make a trip to Tonala...

261
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,521
...you and smiley will go with me.

262
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:54,822
Homie, one more thing...

263
00:35:58,826 --> 00:36:01,245
...you lie to me again...

264
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:05,123
...and I will kill you myself.

265
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:18,136
Horacio, they already cleared the railway...

266
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,013
...the train goes this night thank god.

267
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:46,094
Give me the money!

268
00:39:51,892 --> 00:39:54,061
Fast, fast!

269
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:25,342
give me the money!

270
00:40:28,637 --> 00:40:32,182
Give him the money fast, fast.

271
00:40:33,225 --> 00:40:36,144
That's enough!

272
00:40:52,828 --> 00:40:54,329
Turn around!

273
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,166
Dad, Dad!

274
00:41:46,715 --> 00:41:48,967
Smiley, get off the train!

275
00:41:50,052 --> 00:41:51,970
but.. Casper.

276
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:54,515
Get off man!

277
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:00,020
Go Smiley, Go!

278
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:50,070
He is dangerous.

279
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:52,781
Are you ok?

280
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:55,075
He is not doing anything to us.

281
00:42:56,535 --> 00:42:58,245
He is a gangster man.

282
00:43:00,372 --> 00:43:02,207
We have to knock him off the train.

283
00:44:03,393 --> 00:44:06,271
Immigration! immigration!

284
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:28,418
Raise your spawn "Salvatrucha" gang.

285
00:44:45,936 --> 00:44:47,563
Homies...

286
00:44:50,065 --> 00:44:52,776
...we have to talk about Casper.

287
00:44:53,068 --> 00:44:55,863
We should all go and get him at once.

288
00:44:56,238 --> 00:45:00,325
No Homie, water is not ready for beans yet.

289
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:03,704
Much less with so many fucker around.

290
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,248
They can attack the neighborhood...

291
00:45:06,498 --> 00:45:12,629
...we have to run the voice, even we don't catch
him now, sooner or later the sun will light him

292
00:45:13,172 --> 00:45:15,007
when that happens...

293
00:45:18,844 --> 00:45:22,139
I am not a sissy, that's why I returned.

294
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:29,521
Then you are lucky I don't kill you smiley.

295
00:45:31,523 --> 00:45:34,818
You seem not to have feelings
for the neighborhood, right?

296
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:41,074
If you didn't have the balls to kill Casper,
how do I know you didn't help him escape?

297
00:45:42,993 --> 00:45:44,786
That's what happened right, you fucker?

298
00:45:44,995 --> 00:45:46,914
I didn't do anything!

299
00:45:50,709 --> 00:45:53,545
I will dissapear you from
the neighborhood, you fucker!

300
00:45:59,676 --> 00:46:03,388
Show me you are not a sissy, show me!

301
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:22,616
Send me, send me so I can show you
that I have feelings for the neighborhood.

302
00:46:23,659 --> 00:46:30,332
Send me so I can look for him, and kill him.

303
00:46:39,883 --> 00:46:46,056
Calm down "Sol", hold it, hold it man.

304
00:46:53,021 --> 00:46:54,398
Get going now.

305
00:46:55,566 --> 00:46:58,902
Go and kill him if you want to stand out.

306
00:46:59,945 --> 00:47:05,242
if you don't kill him, then don't even
dare to come back to the neighborhood.

307
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:14,001
Son of a bitch, he doesn't
even know where his dick is!

308
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:19,548
We have to communicate it
to all the gangsters in L.A.

309
00:47:21,675 --> 00:47:25,179
That dog cannot have even a shadow to hide!

310
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:54,791
You going to die.

311
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:49,847
Thank you.

312
00:48:51,682 --> 00:48:52,975
My name is Sayra.

313
00:49:05,237 --> 00:49:07,698
I am Willie.

314
00:49:15,831 --> 00:49:18,041
He killed Lil' Mago...

315
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:22,838
...he got warned, there is green light
to kill him, those are the rules.

316
00:49:23,755 --> 00:49:26,675
And how are you going to kill him?

317
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:35,184
Wow!, thats so pretty! how many you got?

318
00:49:35,809 --> 00:49:38,979
Enough to kill you all.

319
00:49:46,987 --> 00:49:51,909
Kill him but hiding.

320
00:50:43,293 --> 00:50:47,256
Sleep, I will stay awake.

321
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:56,343
You see, my family is very poor, we barely
had a little bit of beans to eat once in a while.

322
00:53:42,514 --> 00:53:44,516
You are not going to wash yourself?

323
00:53:52,608 --> 00:53:54,610
It feels good.

324
00:53:57,905 --> 00:54:00,324
I don't know, maybe later.

325
00:54:03,202 --> 00:54:05,996
When there is less people.

326
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:12,044
And what will you do later?

327
00:54:13,337 --> 00:54:14,630
I don't know.

328
00:54:23,805 --> 00:54:25,724
Will you stay here tonight?

329
00:54:36,401 --> 00:54:39,696
If i find food around I will bring you later.

330
00:54:46,411 --> 00:54:48,247
What were you talking with him?

331
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,040
We can help him.

332
00:54:50,624 --> 00:54:54,711
Are you crazy?
we have to stay away from him.

333
00:54:55,045 --> 00:54:56,547
No, you don't understand.

334
00:54:58,507 --> 00:55:00,342
He is a killer.

335
00:55:00,801 --> 00:55:02,719
- He is in trouble.
- I am ordering you.

336
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:04,972
But he is in trouble!

337
00:55:06,223 --> 00:55:10,853
I don't care about him, I care
about you and my brother Orlando.

338
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:15,899
Look, we still have a long way to get there.

339
00:55:19,194 --> 00:55:25,075
We have to be aware, we
can't let anyone separate us, ok?

340
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,348
Who is the boss?

341
00:55:48,724 --> 00:55:49,433
I am.

342
00:55:52,769 --> 00:55:54,438
I am Smiley from the Confetti neighborhood.

343
00:55:58,859 --> 00:56:01,487
Who is the boss now in the Confetti?

344
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,572
The "Sol".

345
00:56:05,949 --> 00:56:08,160
we knew what happened...

346
00:56:09,953 --> 00:56:12,247
...are you hungry or thirsty?

347
00:56:15,584 --> 00:56:17,753
Have you ever got into one of those?

348
00:56:20,506 --> 00:56:21,965
...me neither.

349
00:56:23,967 --> 00:56:30,098
In a road heading to Texas, I saw
a factory where they build them.

350
00:56:31,767 --> 00:56:35,145
There was a letter board,
very big, with the world shape...

351
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:38,148
...and it was shiny, so beautiful.

352
00:56:40,859 --> 00:56:43,570
I wanted to get on it.

353
00:56:44,905 --> 00:56:51,078
when I go through there, I will
see it and it will remind me of you.

354
00:56:51,578 --> 00:56:53,163
If you make it all the way.

355
00:56:54,748 --> 00:56:58,043
I will make it... I am sure.

356
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:04,591
In Tegus I went with my friend Clarissa,
to my neighbor's house...

357
00:57:04,842 --> 00:57:07,469
...a crazy old lady called Leonor...

358
00:57:07,594 --> 00:57:09,221
...she was a witch.

359
00:57:11,223 --> 00:57:16,687
She told me with scared voice,
you will make it to the U.S.

360
00:57:16,854 --> 00:57:21,859
...but not holding god's hand,
but holding the devil's spawn.

361
00:57:28,198 --> 00:57:32,202
if you come with us, you can show me
the letter board you are talking about...

362
00:57:32,953 --> 00:57:35,372
...we are heading to New Jersey.

363
00:57:38,667 --> 00:57:41,128
They are coming for you right?

364
00:57:42,129 --> 00:57:45,674
I think so, sooner or later they will find me...

365
00:57:47,467 --> 00:57:49,678
...the gang has good memory.

366
00:57:51,221 --> 00:57:52,598
Are you afraid?

367
00:57:54,183 --> 00:57:55,684
To be killed?

368
00:57:56,643 --> 00:58:01,231
No, I live by the day.

369
00:58:02,149 --> 00:58:06,612
What worries me is not knowing
what time and which day they will kill me.

370
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:13,452
- So you have not seen him?
- No.

371
00:58:16,663 --> 00:58:18,165
He has a teardrop tatooed here.

372
00:58:18,373 --> 00:58:22,836
No, I haven't seen anyone tatooed,
since 5 days ago until now you guys.

373
00:58:30,344 --> 00:58:33,472
Hey, sons of a bitch!

374
00:58:34,097 --> 00:58:37,768
I know about that guy you are looking for...

375
00:58:40,062 --> 00:58:43,065
...he has a tear drop tatooed here.

376
00:59:48,839 --> 00:59:50,632
Thank you!

377
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:00,851
We have to get down...

378
01:00:01,268 --> 01:00:02,352
What?

379
01:00:02,853 --> 01:00:04,354
We have to get down.

380
01:00:05,731 --> 01:00:07,316
why?

381
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:11,195
In this station, immigration is
always fucking up...

382
01:00:11,445 --> 01:00:13,030
...and sometimes the police also.

383
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:16,742
So what do we do?

384
01:00:17,284 --> 01:00:21,914
We get down and surround the train fast,
we must be alert!

385
01:00:44,561 --> 01:00:47,189
Good day for running, uh?

386
01:00:49,274 --> 01:00:52,277
Me and Smiley will go the other way...

387
01:00:52,653 --> 01:00:54,655
...we see each other in the other side of the station.

388
01:01:42,703 --> 01:01:45,247
Hey, what's up, ese?

389
01:01:45,455 --> 01:01:47,749
The "M", what's your neighborhood, fucker?

390
01:01:49,668 --> 01:01:51,670
Hey, look at the guy, he is from the other gang.

391
01:01:57,426 --> 01:02:00,012
Take out your fucking gun Smiley!

392
01:02:02,973 --> 01:02:07,227
Don't worry Homie, these
guys always miss the target...

393
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,273
...except this one.

394
01:03:11,416 --> 01:03:13,919
Where the fuck were you Homies?

395
01:03:14,419 --> 01:03:16,839
...didn't you hear the gunshots?

396
01:03:18,632 --> 01:03:22,344
Yes Homie, but we almost catch Casper.

397
01:03:22,636 --> 01:03:29,685
You left us behind with those
assholes, and.. where is Casper?

398
01:03:31,186 --> 01:03:32,604
In the train.

399
01:03:34,064 --> 01:03:36,733
I want to take that fucker down.

400
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:40,529
Get on, Smiley, you go in the front.

401
01:06:35,996 --> 01:06:37,956
You are leaving just like that?

402
01:06:38,665 --> 01:06:39,833
So what do you want?

403
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,919
Go with you.

404
01:06:57,226 --> 01:06:59,311
Oh, God! She fucked up!

405
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:08,237
I can't take care of you.

406
01:07:11,865 --> 01:07:14,535
I am not asking you for it.

407
01:07:15,035 --> 01:07:18,831
For god sake Sayra,
realize that I am a dead man!

408
01:07:19,623 --> 01:07:21,416
...don't you get it?

409
01:07:23,252 --> 01:07:24,795
Don't worry Willie.

410
01:07:25,671 --> 01:07:27,381
Everything will be ok.

411
01:07:35,848 --> 01:07:42,312
You messed up, you don't have
any idea about the mess you are in.

412
01:07:57,703 --> 01:08:00,956
Horacio, Sayra is not here.

413
01:08:11,633 --> 01:08:15,220
Oh Casper, why the fuck you came here?

414
01:08:15,929 --> 01:08:18,891
You are just putting me into trouble.

415
01:08:21,602 --> 01:08:25,314
I can do what you are asking for,
but really, it's trouble.

416
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,775
I have to do some things first.

417
01:08:29,651 --> 01:08:31,278
you guys hungry?

418
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:35,199
You can stay sleeping in the sofa.

419
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,993
Do you guys want to take a shower?

420
01:08:41,163 --> 01:08:43,874
You are a little one.

421
01:08:45,667 --> 01:08:48,504
Well, let me see what I've got.

422
01:08:52,341 --> 01:08:54,510
I thought you didn't have family.

423
01:08:54,635 --> 01:08:57,513
I don't, she is not my aunt...

424
01:08:58,055 --> 01:09:00,891
...I used to take people on her territory.

425
01:09:01,308 --> 01:09:03,227
And she will take us to the border?

426
01:09:06,188 --> 01:09:07,940
Are you coming with me?

427
01:09:08,065 --> 01:09:10,442
Let's see, try this on..

428
01:09:11,652 --> 01:09:13,237
I hope it fits you.

429
01:09:13,654 --> 01:09:15,197
The shower is over there...

430
01:09:15,489 --> 01:09:17,491
...but don't get close to the window, ok?

431
01:09:17,866 --> 01:09:19,785
I don't want anyone to know you are here.

432
01:09:38,095 --> 01:09:40,889
What are you going to do with the girl?

433
01:09:42,641 --> 01:09:47,020
I'll help her get to the border
so she can find her family over there.

434
01:09:49,273 --> 01:09:51,692
And what do you get with all this?

435
01:09:51,817 --> 01:09:53,193
Nothing.

436
01:09:55,904 --> 01:09:57,781
Ok, Casper.

437
01:10:00,075 --> 01:10:02,161
Going straight to the border...

438
01:10:03,662 --> 01:10:05,914
...you know what awaits for you.

439
01:10:07,416 --> 01:10:09,626
Did you know they already called me?

440
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:12,254
And what did you tell them?

441
01:10:12,421 --> 01:10:17,009
Nothing, the truth, that I haven't seen you...
but they called me yesterday.

442
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:26,185
You are not going to tell them, right?

443
01:10:26,435 --> 01:10:28,520
I always do the right thing.

444
01:10:29,521 --> 01:10:32,316
Maybe she went down to
take a pee and the train left her.

445
01:10:37,446 --> 01:10:39,364
She left.

446
01:10:40,782 --> 01:10:42,576
So, we wait here.

447
01:10:49,041 --> 01:10:50,751
We can't wait.

448
01:10:52,461 --> 01:10:55,255
We have to go
or we won't get there either.

449
01:11:22,407 --> 01:11:24,660
Ok, fuck!

450
01:11:39,049 --> 01:11:39,508
Take this.

451
01:11:39,633 --> 01:11:40,634
Thank you, aunt.

452
01:11:40,884 --> 01:11:42,094
Don't thank me.

453
01:12:10,164 --> 01:12:14,626
"Sol", it's a pleasure to hear you.

454
01:12:38,984 --> 01:12:40,277
Are you afraid?

455
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:45,949
No, if I am with you I am ok.

456
01:12:50,162 --> 01:12:55,501
The opposite, while you
are with me you are not ok.

457
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:59,588
I don't care, I trust you.

458
01:13:02,799 --> 01:13:04,760
This scar here...

459
01:13:09,139 --> 01:13:11,850
...my gang sent me to leave
a "chicken" to the border...

460
01:13:13,685 --> 01:13:20,818
...and in Tamaulipas, a cop started to shoot me...

461
01:13:22,694 --> 01:13:29,618
...and here, one from the 18,
there was a fight in their territory.

462
01:13:30,661 --> 01:13:36,959
This scar here is from the night that the
Homies that I have defended all my life...

463
01:13:39,753 --> 01:13:42,297
...killed my love.

464
01:13:45,926 --> 01:13:49,805
And I couldn't do anything for her.

465
01:13:54,143 --> 01:13:57,312
Do you still trust me, Sayra?

466
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:02,067
We both know what a loss is.

467
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:08,615
All that I know, is that my
whole life has been worthless.

468
01:14:09,533 --> 01:14:12,494
And that I can ruin your life too.

469
01:14:27,968 --> 01:14:36,477
Get off, go away!

470
01:14:55,996 --> 01:14:57,039
I love you!

471
01:14:57,789 --> 01:15:00,250
Come on, say it with more feeling.

472
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:04,129
It's just that I love you so much
that I don't even know what to tell you.

473
01:15:04,379 --> 01:15:06,381
I don't know how to express it.

474
01:15:11,428 --> 01:15:14,973
if you can measure it with
your hands, how much would it be?

475
01:15:15,641 --> 01:15:19,770
It wouldn't be possible, I would need many miles...

476
01:15:20,562 --> 01:15:24,066
...or the whole universe to
tell you how much I love you.

477
01:17:22,810 --> 01:17:24,603
Get off, you assholes!

478
01:17:27,815 --> 01:17:31,652
Hide, hide, hide there.

479
01:19:02,201 --> 01:19:07,039
Ok, this card is your pass,
it's only valid for 3 nights...

480
01:19:07,581 --> 01:19:11,752
...then you have to leave to give
space to the people that just arrived.

481
01:19:11,793 --> 01:19:18,300
You have two meals everyday, lunch and
dinner and please respect the rules in the wall.

482
01:19:54,795 --> 01:19:59,508
We don't want low life people like
you here, you fucking gangster.

483
01:20:00,384 --> 01:20:01,385
Not now.

484
01:20:01,718 --> 01:20:05,514
That's the least, you can't be here!

485
01:20:12,062 --> 01:20:14,481
Let him go kid, let him!

486
01:20:24,324 --> 01:20:29,204
Hey, I can't believe that you are here.

487
01:20:29,663 --> 01:20:31,748
Have you seen my dad and my uncle?

488
01:20:39,089 --> 01:20:40,424
What?

489
01:20:40,549 --> 01:20:42,676
Your uncle was deported, and...

490
01:20:48,348 --> 01:20:51,351
...your father is not with us anymore.

491
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:58,687
When we are in the other side,
I want you to promise something.

492
01:22:59,271 --> 01:23:00,314
What?

493
01:23:00,481 --> 01:23:04,151
That no matter what, you
will look for your family in New Jersey.

494
01:23:10,908 --> 01:23:14,036
Now you have to little sisters
that have no father anymore.

495
01:23:14,995 --> 01:23:18,957
I would be trouble for them,
as I am for everyone.

496
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:20,918
Not for me.

497
01:23:25,005 --> 01:23:29,510
But you have to help them
in something, working.

498
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:36,600
Are you coming with me?

499
01:23:38,101 --> 01:23:39,019
Yes.

500
01:23:58,872 --> 01:24:00,374
I am looking for a boat.

501
01:24:00,874 --> 01:24:02,584
Do you want to cross?

502
01:24:19,726 --> 01:24:20,811
Come on!

503
01:24:28,819 --> 01:24:30,237
I can only pass one at the time.

504
01:24:30,612 --> 01:24:31,697
The money?

505
01:24:32,739 --> 01:24:34,491
When we cross we give it to you.

506
01:25:01,643 --> 01:25:02,811
Go on fast.

507
01:25:17,868 --> 01:25:19,745
Turn around.

508
01:25:44,978 --> 01:25:47,356
Hurry up and get in the water.

509
01:26:14,508 --> 01:26:17,845
No... we have to go back!

510
01:26:33,152 --> 01:26:34,695
Let me go!

511
01:26:51,753 --> 01:26:53,046
Smiley...

512
01:26:57,217 --> 01:26:59,136
The gang is forever, Homie.

513
01:30:57,916 --> 01:31:01,628
Collect call, please.

514
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:04,131
Sayra.

515
01:31:15,350 --> 01:31:17,186
Hello?

516
01:31:20,689 --> 01:31:21,982
Yessenia?
