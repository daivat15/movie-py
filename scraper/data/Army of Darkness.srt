1
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,643
My name is Ash,

2
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:49,811
and I am a slave.

3
00:00:53,273 --> 00:00:58,778
Close as I can figure it the year is 13000 AD
and I'm being dragged to my death.

4
00:00:58,612 --> 00:01:00,113
It wasn't always like this.

5
00:01:01,532 --> 00:01:03,825
I had a real life... once.

6
00:01:05,452 --> 00:01:06,536
A job.

7
00:01:12,626 --> 00:01:18,757
Amm.. Hardware, out 12.
Shop smart, shop S-Mart.

8
00:01:17,506 --> 00:01:19,216
I had a wonderful girlfriend...

9
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:20,884
Linda.

10
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,098
Together we drove to a small cabin
in the mountains.

11
00:01:30,143 --> 00:01:33,771
It seemas that an archeologist
have come to this remote place

12
00:01:33,313 --> 00:01:35,106
to translate and study

13
00:01:34,982 --> 00:01:37,317
his latest find.

14
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:43,365
Necronomicon Ex Mortis.
The Book Of The Dead.

15
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:46,493
Bound in human flesh

16
00:01:46,076 --> 00:01:50,538
and inked in blood.

17
00:01:49,663 --> 00:01:53,416
This ancient Cimmerian text contained
bizarre burial rights,

18
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:58,004
Funerary incantations and
demon ressurection passages.

19
00:01:58,505 --> 00:02:01,132
It was never ment for the world of the living.

20
00:02:01,716 --> 00:02:04,969
The book awoke something dark in the woods.

21
00:02:11,351 --> 00:02:13,895
It took Linda.

22
00:02:13,728 --> 00:02:16,689
And than it came... for me.

23
00:02:17,691 --> 00:02:20,902
It got into my hand and it went bad.

24
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,488
So I lopped it off at the wrist.

25
00:02:28,285 --> 00:02:30,453
But that didn't stop it.

26
00:02:30,036 --> 00:02:32,538
It came back.

27
00:02:34,207 --> 00:02:36,792
Big time.

28
00:02:52,976 --> 00:02:56,479
For God's sake, how do you stop it?! NO!

29
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:24,799
ARMY OF DARKNESS

30
00:03:23,048 --> 00:03:31,389
Subtitles provider:
Sibirski

31
00:04:07,634 --> 00:04:12,764
Where the hell...

32
00:04:22,315 --> 00:04:24,859
Wow... now... easy now chief.

33
00:04:24,317 --> 00:04:26,485
Amm... I don't know how I got here,

34
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:30,782
and... amm... I'm not looking for any trouble.

35
00:04:32,992 --> 00:04:35,202
What a piece of armor is this?

36
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:37,621
Wiseman!

37
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:48,174
Mu lord, I believe he is the one
written of in the Necronomicon.

38
00:04:47,173 --> 00:04:53,053
He who is prophesized to fall from the heavens
and delier us from the terrors of the Deadites.

39
00:04:52,345 --> 00:04:54,513
What? That bafoon?

40
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:00,143
Likely, he is one of the Henry's men!

41
00:05:03,523 --> 00:05:06,734
I say to the pit with him!

42
00:05:07,944 --> 00:05:09,070
To the pit!

43
00:05:11,697 --> 00:05:14,282
You miserable bastard!

44
00:05:15,868 --> 00:05:21,123
Get off of me!

45
00:05:37,723 --> 00:05:39,933
All right men, you've got something to look forward to...

46
00:05:58,536 --> 00:06:02,623
Lor Arthur approaches! Raise the port!

47
00:06:50,296 --> 00:06:52,214
Lord Arthur!

48
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:54,007
Where is my brother?

49
00:06:53,632 --> 00:06:55,467
Did he not ride with you?

50
00:06:55,092 --> 00:06:57,677
Aye!

51
00:06:57,678 --> 00:07:01,556
And fought valiantly. Last night
he fell in to Duke Henry's men.

52
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,977
I'm sorry Sheila.

53
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,523
Stop it you bastards! Barbarians!

54
00:07:21,869 --> 00:07:26,748
Stop it! Stop it you little brat!

55
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:27,540
Thou art a murderer! Black murderer!

56
00:07:33,881 --> 00:07:38,010
My brother's death shall be avenged!

57
00:07:50,522 --> 00:07:53,775
Company pull!

58
00:08:01,074 --> 00:08:04,994
Kill him! Into the pit!

59
00:08:12,377 --> 00:08:15,880
You sir, are not one of my vassals.

60
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,592
Who are you?

61
00:08:19,384 --> 00:08:21,886
Who want's to know?

62
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:30,145
I am Henry the Red. Duke of Shale, Lord of the Northlands
and leader of its people.

63
00:08:29,561 --> 00:08:32,355
Well hello mister Mr. Fancypants.

64
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:40,572
I got news for you pal, you ain't leadin'
but two things now: Jack and shit.
And Jack left town.

65
00:08:39,071 --> 00:08:41,573
Shut your mouth!

66
00:08:41,615 --> 00:08:44,117
Gentleman, lord Arthur!

67
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:56,545
There is an evil awakened in this land,

68
00:08:55,629 --> 00:09:00,467
and while my people fight
to their very soul against it,

69
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:02,343
you Henry the Red, waged war on us!

70
00:09:02,552 --> 00:09:10,601
-Charlatan! It was you who raised your swords on us.

71
00:09:09,476 --> 00:09:13,229
And this evil is fought my people as well!

72
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:16,274
Your people are no better than the foul corruption

73
00:09:15,482 --> 00:09:18,526
that lies in the bowels of that pit!

74
00:09:19,945 --> 00:09:24,407
May God have mercy on your souls.

75
00:09:37,671 --> 00:09:41,841
God's name, what hell lurkes there?!

76
00:09:46,346 --> 00:09:50,808
Aye. Into the pit with the bloodthirsty sons of whores!

77
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:35,769
-Heavenly God!
-He's escaping!

78
00:11:19,522 --> 00:11:24,902
Wow! Holt it! Wait a minute...

79
00:11:23,943 --> 00:11:26,320
You gotta understand

80
00:11:26,738 --> 00:11:30,074
I've never even saw these assholes before!

81
00:11:35,997 --> 00:11:39,417
Henry, you gotta tell him you don't know me.

82
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,543
We never met. Tell 'em!

83
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:46,548
I do not think he'll listen, lad.

84
00:11:47,884 --> 00:11:52,763
Look, I'm telling you. You've got the wrong guy.

85
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:30,152
Spikes.

86
00:13:30,945 --> 00:13:32,946
Ay, he said spikes, give him spikes.

87
00:13:47,211 --> 00:13:49,671
Make way!

88
00:13:49,171 --> 00:13:50,881
Strange one!

89
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,310
Strange one!

90
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,670
Damn you. Damn you.

91
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:57,215
You know, your shoelace is untied.

92
00:16:07,642 --> 00:16:10,144
Alright,

93
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:13,273
who want some?

94
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,817
Who's next?

95
00:16:15,484 --> 00:16:18,320
Huh? How 'bout it?

96
00:16:19,196 --> 00:16:21,698
Who want some?!

97
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:24,617
Huh? Who want's to have a little?

98
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:30,456
You!

99
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,042
You want some more?

100
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:39,299
You want a little?

101
00:16:42,177 --> 00:16:44,721
Do ya? Want some more?! Huh?!

102
00:17:00,528 --> 00:17:04,823
Now get on those horses and get out of here.

103
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,412
Let him go!

104
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:34,020
-Halt!
-Thank you generous hosts!

105
00:17:37,774 --> 00:17:39,942
Swordfight!

106
00:17:47,117 --> 00:17:52,288
For that arrogance I shall see you dead.

107
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:07,219
Yeah. All right you primitive screwheads! Listen up!

108
00:18:07,762 --> 00:18:10,639
See this?!

109
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:15,644
This is my BOOM-STICK!

110
00:18:15,144 --> 00:18:20,691
12 gauge double-bareled Remington,
S-Mart's top of the line.

111
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,528
You can find this on sporting good's
department.

112
00:18:23,528 --> 00:18:27,490
That's right this sweet baby
was made in Grandrappids Michigen.

113
00:18:26,823 --> 00:18:30,243
Retails are about 109.95$

114
00:18:29,784 --> 00:18:35,873
It has a wallnut stock, cobalt blue steel
and a hear trigger.

115
00:18:35,123 --> 00:18:38,584
That's right. Shop smart. Shop S-Mart!

116
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:43,797
YOU GOT THAT!

117
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:53,474
Now I swear, next one of you primates,
even touches me...

118
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:24,713
Now, let's talk about how I get home.

119
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:00,874
I pray thee to forgive me, my lord.
I believed thee one of Henry's men.

120
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:06,963
First you wanna kill me, now you wanna kiss me. Blow.

121
00:20:10,384 --> 00:20:13,845
So, what's the deal? Can you send me back or not?

122
00:20:13,387 --> 00:20:18,975
Only the Necronomicon has the power.
And a holy book which we also require.

123
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:23,230
Within its pages are passages,
that can send you back in your time.

124
00:20:22,229 --> 00:20:26,441
Only you the Promised One can quest for it.

125
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:30,070
I don't want your book, I don't want your bullshit,

126
00:20:29,278 --> 00:20:33,031
just send me back to my own time, pronto, today ch...

127
00:20:42,917 --> 00:20:46,253
You shall die!

128
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:55,471
You shall never taim the Necronomicon!

129
00:20:55,346 --> 00:21:01,935
We shall feast upon your souls!

130
00:21:22,206 --> 00:21:25,959
It's a trick. Get an axe.

131
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:41,766
Oh my eyes! I'm blind!

132
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:52,569
Yo she-bitch!

133
00:21:53,404 --> 00:21:55,906
Let's go.

134
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:20,471
If the Necronomicon falls into the hands of Deadites,

135
00:22:19,847 --> 00:22:23,392
the whole mankind can be consumed by this evil.

136
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:26,102
Now, will thou quest for the book?!

137
00:22:38,865 --> 00:22:41,450
That one.

138
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:10,563
Groovie!

139
00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:26,162
What's the matter? Raised in a barn?
Shut the door.

140
00:23:38,091 --> 00:23:41,886
The wiseman says thou art the Promised One.

141
00:23:45,015 --> 00:23:51,563
It is said thee will journey for the book to help us.
And thou will lead our people against the evil.

142
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:55,733
Only reason I'm going to get the book is to get home...

143
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:03,032
I believe thou will be leaving in the morning.

144
00:24:02,532 --> 00:24:04,700
Don't touch that.

145
00:24:04,284 --> 00:24:08,371
Your primitive intelect wouldn't understand
alloyes and composition and...

146
00:24:07,537 --> 00:24:16,587
things with molecular stucture and...
What are you doing here, anyway?

147
00:24:16,796 --> 00:24:22,343
I want to say that all of my hopes
and prayers go with thee,

148
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,761
and I made this for thee.

149
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:27,306
Good, I need hors' blanket.

150
00:24:49,329 --> 00:24:52,832
Gimme some sugar baby.

151
00:25:32,872 --> 00:25:34,915
What? What is it?

152
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:43,633
This path will lead you to an unholy place, a cemetery.
There a Necronomicon awates.

153
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:50,139
When thou retreves the book from its cradle
you must recite the words:

154
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,933
Clatoo, Verata, Nicto.

155
00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:55,144
Clatoo, Verata, Nicto. OK.

156
00:25:55,895 --> 00:25:58,397
Well, repeat them.

157
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,649
Clatoo, Verata, Nicto.

158
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,734
Again!

159
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:06,239
I got it! I got it! I know your damn words alright?!

160
00:26:05,488 --> 00:26:08,449
Now you get his straight, both of you!

161
00:26:08,032 --> 00:26:14,204
If I get that book, you send me back.
After that I'm history.

162
00:26:54,036 --> 00:26:56,204
What is it boy?

163
00:29:33,487 --> 00:29:35,989
Ready, aim, fire!

164
00:29:44,665 --> 00:29:47,918
Oh, ough, you lousy little...

165
00:30:55,068 --> 00:30:57,528
What a horrible nightmare. Oh God!

166
00:30:57,988 --> 00:31:00,615
I can't move!

167
00:31:43,992 --> 00:31:49,747
OK little fella. How 'bout some hot chocolate? Huh?!

168
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:02,009
How'd you like a taste of that? How'd you like a...

169
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,282
Oh dear God, it's growing bigger!

170
00:32:41,007 --> 00:32:44,468
I'm bling. I'm blind.

171
00:32:53,853 --> 00:32:56,355
Where are you taking me?

172
00:33:03,613 --> 00:33:06,115
What are you?

173
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,242
Are you me?

174
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:10,411
I'm bad ASh.

175
00:33:09,911 --> 00:33:14,290
And you're good Ash. Little goody two-shoes!

176
00:33:43,444 --> 00:33:49,950
Good, bad... I'm the guy with a gun.

177
00:34:48,718 --> 00:34:54,306
That'll teach ya. That'll teach ya.

178
00:34:55,015 --> 00:34:58,268
You shall never retrev the Necronomicon!

179
00:34:57,893 --> 00:35:01,396
You'll die in the graveyard before you get it!

180
00:35:01,355 --> 00:35:05,484
Hey, what's that you got on you face?

181
00:35:06,235 --> 00:35:09,071
I'll come back for you!

182
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,372
Three books?!

183
00:36:45,584 --> 00:36:48,086
Wait a minute. Hold it.

184
00:36:48,253 --> 00:36:51,839
Nobody said anything about three books.

185
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:55,093
Like... like what am I supposed to do?

186
00:36:54,927 --> 00:36:59,598
Take one book, or all books?

187
00:37:58,323 --> 00:38:00,825
Or... or what?

188
00:38:56,923 --> 00:39:01,844
You... I'll get back to you.

189
00:39:06,015 --> 00:39:08,851
Well, it seems fairly obvious.

190
00:39:11,771 --> 00:39:16,275
Ouh, wait a minute... the words... rght, right, right.

191
00:39:16,234 --> 00:39:18,778
Say the words.

192
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:24,450
CLATOO...

193
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,910
VERATA...

194
00:39:25,535 --> 00:39:28,037
N...

195
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:39,006
Nicty, Nictor, Nicle...

196
00:39:46,431 --> 00:39:49,725
It's an "N" word. Definitely an "N" word.

197
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:06,701
CLATOO, VERATA, N@$#*%^!...

198
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:23,759
OK than. That's it!

199
00:40:33,436 --> 00:40:38,816
Hey, wait a minute. Everything's cool.

200
00:40:38,524 --> 00:40:41,193
I said the words!

201
00:40:40,651 --> 00:40:45,447
I did! No!

202
00:40:51,871 --> 00:40:56,041
You people seek cover!

203
00:40:56,542 --> 00:41:02,464
Seek your children!

204
00:41:02,632 --> 00:41:06,177
Something's wrong! Something's amiss!

205
00:42:15,538 --> 00:42:18,666
I'll crush you, I'll mash you, you bony things...

206
00:42:44,233 --> 00:42:48,695
I'm threw being their garbidge boy. I did my part.

207
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:51,532
Now I want back. Like in the deal.

208
00:43:02,543 --> 00:43:07,047
I live...

209
00:43:07,798 --> 00:43:10,926
... again!

210
00:43:19,435 --> 00:43:25,649
Hey, the Promised One! The Promised One has returned!

211
00:43:36,952 --> 00:43:39,704
He is the Promised One!

212
00:43:39,997 --> 00:43:42,332
He brought the Necronomicon!

213
00:43:44,543 --> 00:43:48,588
Yeah, great, great. Fuck out of my face.

214
00:43:54,219 --> 00:43:59,807
The Necronomicon quickly. Did you bring the Necronomicon?

215
00:43:59,391 --> 00:44:03,061
-Yeah, it's... it's just that...
-Just what?!

216
00:44:03,604 --> 00:44:06,440
Nothing. Here.

217
00:44:12,529 --> 00:44:15,281
Now send me back, like in the deal.

218
00:44:15,574 --> 00:44:20,078
When you removed the Necronomicon from the cradle,
did yopu speak the words?

219
00:44:20,412 --> 00:44:24,124
-Yeah, basically...
-Did you speak the exact words?

220
00:44:23,373 --> 00:44:29,420
Well maybe I didn't say every single tiny little syllable,
no, but basically I said them, yeah.

221
00:44:28,211 --> 00:44:36,677
Damn thee fool! Thou has doomed us all!
When thee spoke the words the army of the dead awoke!

222
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,887
Now, wow,wow right there spinach-chin.

223
00:44:37,346 --> 00:44:43,685
You said that you can clean this mess up, once you got that book.

224
00:44:42,434 --> 00:44:45,228
You said there's a passage in there that can rid this
thing and send me back.

225
00:44:44,644 --> 00:44:50,191
It's true. The book still posesses the power to send you back,
but to us... It is useless!

226
00:44:49,107 --> 00:44:56,155
The evil has a terrible hunger for the Necronomicon!
And it will come here, to get it.

227
00:44:55,197 --> 00:45:01,661
We had a deal. You wanted the damn book, I got it for ya.

228
00:45:00,368 --> 00:45:03,037
I did my part now you send me back!

229
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:09,627
Very well. As we are a men of our word
we shall honor a bargain.

230
00:45:09,377 --> 00:45:13,714
The Wiseman shall return you to your own time.

231
00:45:13,381 --> 00:45:15,216
Yeah?!

232
00:45:15,717 --> 00:45:17,468
We thought he was the One.

233
00:45:17,135 --> 00:45:20,555
Yeah, right, cause that was the deal.

234
00:45:19,846 --> 00:45:24,684
When do you think we could... start with all the... thing in a...

235
00:45:28,355 --> 00:45:34,194
-When do you think we can start with all the... ceremony and...
-Wretched excuse for a man!

236
00:45:36,029 --> 00:45:39,657
The Wiseman was a fool to trusted you.

237
00:45:40,367 --> 00:45:42,994
I knew he couldn't be trusted.

238
00:45:45,705 --> 00:45:48,124
I still believe that thou will help us.

239
00:45:48,291 --> 00:45:51,711
Oh, Sheila, don't you get it?

240
00:45:51,044 --> 00:45:57,175
It's over. I didn't have what it took.

241
00:45:57,759 --> 00:46:00,261
So long.

242
00:46:03,807 --> 00:46:10,271
But what of all the things we share?
What of all the sweet words that you spoke in private?

243
00:46:11,815 --> 00:46:16,694
Oh, well that's just what we call pillow-talk, baby. That's all.

244
00:46:16,152 --> 00:46:19,446
It was more than that.

245
00:46:19,489 --> 00:46:22,575
I still have faith in thee.

246
00:46:22,117 --> 00:46:26,538
I still believe that thou will stay and save us.

247
00:46:31,417 --> 00:46:33,752
I... Covard.

248
00:46:55,817 --> 00:46:58,027
Help me!

249
00:46:58,444 --> 00:47:01,029
Sheila!

250
00:47:12,709 --> 00:47:16,254
Hold your arms you'll hit the girl!

251
00:47:26,681 --> 00:47:28,557
Damn you!

252
00:47:46,743 --> 00:47:52,165
Dig damn you! Dig faster!

253
00:47:51,748 --> 00:47:54,750
I shall command every wormy flesh son of a bitch...

254
00:47:54,167 --> 00:47:57,753
-...that ever died in battle.
-Thank you sir!

255
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:02,132
-You there hansom me now!
-Aye my leash!
-We shall strong their castle and get my book!

256
00:48:09,015 --> 00:48:16,731
Welcome back to the land of the living.
Now pick up a showel and get digging!

257
00:48:17,523 --> 00:48:20,525
Bring on the witch!

258
00:48:31,245 --> 00:48:33,872
Gimme some sugar baby!

259
00:48:39,128 --> 00:48:44,216
Boy, aren't you a sweet little thing?

260
00:48:43,215 --> 00:48:46,927
Don't touch me you foul thing.

261
00:48:46,427 --> 00:48:48,762
Come on.

262
00:48:48,554 --> 00:48:52,140
That's it.

263
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,727
We've got planes for you valley girl! Move!

264
00:49:11,911 --> 00:49:16,498
The scout approaches!

265
00:49:23,506 --> 00:49:25,883
-Arise.
-My lord.

266
00:49:25,424 --> 00:49:29,052
An army of the dead is gathering in the wilderness,
and approaches the castle.

267
00:49:28,302 --> 00:49:32,055
-How far from here?
-'Bout two days ride.

268
00:49:32,932 --> 00:49:36,852
-Perhaps we should flee as soon as possible?
-We'll be safe in the mountains.

269
00:49:36,185 --> 00:49:40,647
It is written Arthur! It is been fortold!

270
00:49:39,772 --> 00:49:44,151
-It'll take our souls!
-We will die!

271
00:49:45,653 --> 00:49:53,994
Go ahead and run! Run home and cry to mama!

272
00:49:53,327 --> 00:50:04,087
Me, I threw running! I say we stay here and fight it out.

273
00:50:02,378 --> 00:50:08,133
Are all men from the future loud mouth braggarts?!

274
00:50:06,966 --> 00:50:12,262
Nope. Just me baby. Just me.

275
00:50:12,638 --> 00:50:17,100
How we'll fight an army of the dead at
our castle's walls?

276
00:50:17,101 --> 00:50:19,061
How will you fight that?

277
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:19,478
More words?!

278
00:50:19,478 --> 00:50:24,733
Most of our people had already fled. We are but 60 men.

279
00:50:24,817 --> 00:50:27,819
Than we'll get Henry the Red and his men to fight with us.

280
00:50:33,367 --> 00:50:35,243
Now, who's with me?!

281
00:50:49,216 --> 00:50:50,842
I'll stand by ya.

282
00:50:53,345 --> 00:50:56,097
You can count on my steel.

283
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:58,308
I'll offer up my courage.

284
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:00,352
And me!

285
00:51:26,169 --> 00:51:28,713
Well my dear...

286
00:51:28,213 --> 00:51:31,424
say hello to the boys.

287
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:50,776
I may be bad, but I feel... good.

288
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:53,821
-Who rules?
-You my lord!
-You sir!

289
00:51:53,113 --> 00:51:56,950
To the castle!

290
00:53:17,447 --> 00:53:21,951
They are comming! The Deadites approach!

291
00:53:38,551 --> 00:53:40,928
There's so many damn of 'em.

292
00:53:43,848 --> 00:53:50,563
Maybe... just maybe my boys'll
stop 'em from taking the book.

293
00:53:54,192 --> 00:53:59,780
Yeah, maybe I'm a Chinese jet pilot.

294
00:54:33,272 --> 00:54:36,817
On the battle-station! Get those rocks on the double!

295
00:54:36,109 --> 00:54:38,486
Ready the catapult!

296
00:54:38,027 --> 00:54:40,988
By God let's give them one for!

297
00:54:48,788 --> 00:54:52,583
Company halts! Company halt!

298
00:55:44,844 --> 00:55:49,014
-Bing on the scout!
-My Lord, we have position on both fronts.

299
00:55:49,015 --> 00:55:52,560
-Fine, fine, fine... Where are they keeping my book?

300
00:55:51,392 --> 00:55:55,145
There my Lord, beyond the wall.

301
00:55:54,395 --> 00:55:56,897
That would be the most likely place.

302
00:55:57,606 --> 00:56:03,111
Right. Bring me forth into the castle!

303
00:56:02,028 --> 00:56:05,906
Forward!

304
00:56:05,364 --> 00:56:11,078
By havoc let them loose the dogs of war!

305
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:12,912
To the castle!

306
00:56:16,542 --> 00:56:19,836
Death to the mortals!

307
00:56:22,339 --> 00:56:23,923
Arrows!

308
00:56:23,758 --> 00:56:26,343
Torch by!

309
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,463
Steady...

310
00:57:09,511 --> 00:57:12,889
Fire!

311
00:57:44,004 --> 00:57:47,632
Squire, the second division approaching from the south.

312
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:51,178
Ram the gates!

313
00:57:55,432 --> 00:57:59,978
Catapults!

314
00:58:08,278 --> 00:58:12,657
Fire!

315
00:58:27,756 --> 00:58:31,676
-Seek cover!
-Watch out!
-Make way!

316
00:58:45,065 --> 00:58:48,610
Ough! Oh, you miserable bags of bones!

317
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:59,579
Pick yourselves up and sally arh... sally agh... sally forth.

318
00:59:13,969 --> 00:59:16,638
Forward!

319
00:59:17,973 --> 00:59:21,184
Clutches the door, now!

320
00:59:45,041 --> 00:59:47,460
Oooh! That's gotta hurt!

321
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:52,298
Down you creatures! Arrows!

322
01:00:02,475 --> 01:00:06,478
We've broken through! The castle's ours!

323
01:00:48,772 --> 01:00:51,774
Fall back!

324
01:00:51,524 --> 01:00:54,318
Protect the book!

325
01:00:54,194 --> 01:00:56,821
God save us all.

326
01:01:01,075 --> 01:01:04,203
Say hello to the 21st century.

327
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:20,552
Come on! I got plenty for everybody!

328
01:01:32,732 --> 01:01:36,277
Up and get him!

329
01:02:10,436 --> 01:02:12,813
Sheila...

330
01:02:37,004 --> 01:02:39,339
We've secured the cortyard, my Lord.

331
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:41,466
Excellent.

332
01:03:18,671 --> 01:03:21,924
-My Lord...
-Stay with the book!

333
01:03:21,757 --> 01:03:24,259
A bok where we are.

334
01:03:27,722 --> 01:03:32,226
The Red! The Red! Duke Henry
and his men arrived!

335
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:41,318
Bows, bolts arms and heads!

336
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:24,569
The book is mine.

337
01:04:32,411 --> 01:04:34,496
Now I'll cut your desert out.

338
01:04:35,748 --> 01:04:37,833
Hey, where'd he go? Hey!

339
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:50,303
Come to papa.

340
01:04:50,596 --> 01:04:52,180
Get him.

341
01:05:18,624 --> 01:05:22,961
Oh you crazy bitch, get off me!

342
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:39,519
You found me beautiful once.

343
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:43,356
Honey, you got real ugly.

344
01:05:58,664 --> 01:06:01,208
There we are.

345
01:06:09,174 --> 01:06:14,721
Wanna play rough, ey?

346
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:31,112
Prepare to die!

347
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:46,294
You're going down.

348
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,962
I'm goin' up.

349
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:50,089
I'm coming for ya!

350
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:45,311
I'll spoil those good looks! Backstabber!

351
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:13,923
We cant hold the battle!

352
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,508
We will hold! We must protect the book!

353
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:32,316
I got a bone to pick with you. Come on.

354
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:23,451
At last! The book!

355
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:31,250
I posses the Necronomicon!

356
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:35,880
No I'll have my vengeance!

357
01:09:35,046 --> 01:09:39,675
Buckle up bonehead, cause you're going for a ride.

358
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:56,191
Victory is ours!

359
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:02,072
-Retreat! Retreat!
-Let's get the hell out of here!

360
01:11:25,906 --> 01:11:28,450
Hey Henry.

361
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:28,992
How's it going?

362
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:32,871
Well won my friend.

363
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:41,087
We're brother's then...

364
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:44,966
a new kingdom shall be born!

365
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:50,638
The book tells us that once you drink this liquid,

366
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:54,851
and recite the words: Clatoo, Verata, Nicto

367
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:58,021
thou shall awaken in thou own time.

368
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:03,819
Remember, you must recite the words exactly.

369
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:58,540
I thought about staying.

370
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:02,210
They offered me a chance to lead them, teach them... to...

371
01:13:01,376 --> 01:13:03,878
to be king!

372
01:13:04,212 --> 01:13:06,297
But my place is here,

373
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:09,384
so I swallow the juice, said the words,

374
01:13:08,675 --> 01:13:10,134
and here I am.

375
01:13:09,843 --> 01:13:12,345
Did you said the words right this time?

376
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:17,308
Well maybe I didn't say every
single tiny little syllable,

377
01:13:17,309 --> 01:13:19,144
no, but basically I said them, yeah.

378
01:13:20,604 --> 01:13:22,397
Basically...

379
01:13:25,358 --> 01:13:27,777
You know that story how you could have been king?

380
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:31,114
I... think it's kind a cute.

381
01:13:32,324 --> 01:13:33,575
Yeah.

382
01:13:52,385 --> 01:13:53,969
Die!

383
01:14:08,443 --> 01:14:11,946
Lady I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave the store.

384
01:14:11,821 --> 01:14:14,073
Who the hell are you?!

385
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:15,617
Name's Ash...

386
01:14:17,661 --> 01:14:18,953
House-wares.

387
01:14:39,849 --> 01:14:42,601
I'll swallow your soul!

388
01:14:42,602 --> 01:14:43,686
Come get some.

389
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:07,585
Sure I could 've stayed in the past...

390
01:15:08,628 --> 01:15:10,296
coul of even been king...

391
01:15:12,382 --> 01:15:16,803
But in my own way... I am king.

392
01:15:18,138 --> 01:15:19,806
Hail to the king baby.
