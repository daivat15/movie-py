...seemed very pleased.

01:42:24,139 --> 01:42:28,225
I think the girl was the only one
who guessed at their position.

You're just as l imagined you:
you're my political conscience.

878
01:42:33,106 --> 01:42:37,609
I asked him, hadn't he one of his own?
And so he talked about the Revolution.

879
01:42:37,819 --> 01:42:42,323
You lay life on a table, and you cut out
all the tumors of injustice. Marvelous.

880
01:42:42,532 --> 01:42:45,993
I told him if he felt like that,
he should join the Party.

881
01:42:46,202 --> 01:42:49,705
But cutting out the tumors of injustice,
that's a deep operation.

882
01:42:49,914 --> 01:42:55,085
Someone must keep life alive while you
do it, by living. lsn't that right?

883
01:42:55,295 --> 01:42:57,546
I thought, then, it was wrong.

884
01:42:58,048 --> 01:43:01,884
He told me what he thought
about the Party and I trembled for him.

885
01:43:02,093 --> 01:43:06,847
He approved of us, but for reasons
which were subtle, like his verse.

886
01:43:07,057 --> 01:43:10,809
Approval such as his could
vanish overnight. I told him so.

887
01:43:11,019 --> 01:43:14,396
Well, l can't approve this evening
something you may do tomorrow.

888
01:43:14,606 --> 01:43:18,567
He was walking about with a noose
round his neck and didn't know.

889
01:43:18,985 --> 01:43:22,654
So I told him what
I had heard about his poems.

890
01:43:24,908 --> 01:43:26,825
Not liked?

891
01:43:27,452 --> 01:43:29,328
Not liked by whom?

892
01:43:30,246 --> 01:43:31,455
Why not liked?

893
01:43:31,664 --> 01:43:34,124
So I told him that.

894
01:43:42,717 --> 01:43:46,595
Do you think it's "personal,
petit-bourgeois and self-indulgent'!?

895
01:43:47,472 --> 01:43:48,847
I lied.

896
01:43:49,974 --> 01:43:51,642
But he believed me.

897
01:43:52,102 --> 01:43:55,813
It struck me through
to see that my opinion mattered.

898
01:43:57,273 --> 01:43:59,775
The girl knew what it meant,
what it was going to mean.

899

They couldn't survive
what was coming in the city.

900
01:44:03,321 --> 01:44:06,407
I urged them to leave and live
obscurely in the country...

901
01:44:06,616 --> 01:44:08,617

keep themselves alive.

01:44:17,168 --> 01:44:21,922
He didn't resist. I offered
to obtain permits, passes, warrants.

905
01:44:22,132 --> 01:44:25,050
Told them what to take
and what to leave behind.

906
01:44:28,805 --> 01:44:32,933
I had the impertinence to ask him
for a volume of his poems.

907
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:35,269
And so we parted.

908

I think I even told him that we would
meet again in better times.
