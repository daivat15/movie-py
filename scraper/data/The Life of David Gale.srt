1
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,626
Shit!

2
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,595
Stop, please!

3
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:31,614
<i>In a related story, the
high court had also refused to stay</i>

4
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:35,539
<i>Friday's execution of former
philosophy professor David Gale.</i>

5
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,834
<i>Gale had sought a review
of his 1994 conviction</i>

6
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,004
<i>for the rape and murder of his
University of Austin colleague,</i>

<i>Constance Harraway.</i>

8
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,174
<i>The case has received
nationwide media attention</i>

9
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,879
<i>because Gale and Harraway
were activists for Death Watch,</i>

10
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,259
<i>a nonprofit abolitionist
organization.</i>

11
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:57,266
<i>Do you understand how much money taxpayers
pay in Texas to put one person to death?</i>

12
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:00,139
<i>- What do we want?
- No more executions!</i>

13
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:03,483
<i>Governor, can't we all admit
the capital punishment system</i>

14
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,980
<i>in this country is not working?</i>

15
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,859
They're not going to stay Gale.
It's on TV right now. Listen.

16
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,781
<i>Defense lawyers
had hoped to argue</i>

17
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,735
<i>that Gale's former activism
against capital punishment</i>

18
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,537
<i>unduly prejudiced
the Texas judicial system.</i>

19
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:19,116
The deal was Bitsey would get the
interview if the stay was refused.

20
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,327
He'll talk to her for
two hours a day,

21
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,538
Tuesday, Wednesday
and Thursday.

22
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,831
Can't do Friday. No.

23
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,258
Friday's the day
they execute him.

24
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,883
The lawyer said only Bitsey.

25
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,635
Gale's going down.
Shh!

26
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,600
Only Bitsey means only Bitsey.

27
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,143
I don't get to
make the rules, Joe.

28
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,765
Please, I'm a fat black woman.

29
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:42,348
What we need is to put
her on a plane to Texas.

30
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,558
Why do you get like
that around legal?

31
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,689
Hold on, we're coming over.

32
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,698
What's this "Only Bitsey
means only Bitsey" stuff?

33
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,946
They asked for you,
and no substitutes.

34
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,073
Who's they, exactly?
Gale's lawyers.

35
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:59,783
More exactly, Gale's lawyer.
Some good old boy in Austin.

36
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,082
Why do they want me?

37
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,375
You don't want the assignment?

38
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,744
I'm not saying that.

39
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,171
I can't see why a guy
about to be executed

40
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,623
should suddenly ask for me.

41
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:10,960
Maybe they liked your kiddie
porn piece, and going to jail.

42
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,511
Maybe he saw your picture
and thinks you're cute.

43
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,260
So how much access do I get?

44
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,007
Three interviews.
No time for more.

45
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,808
By Friday, the guy's a goner.

46
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,386
What exactly is our story?

47
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,309
Rape, murder, death row.

48
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,775
Very intelligent guy.
Maybe he's even innocent.

49
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,227
Yeah, right.

50
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,522
No, tell him I'll
call him back. Thanks.

51
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,448
So what's your problem?

52
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,993
Hi, Barbara. Morning, Bitsey.
Okay, here's my concern.

53
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,782
Setting aside the cost issue,

54
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:42,116
although $500,000 in cash
for three days of interviews

55
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,167
is not only illegal,
it's obscene.

56
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,995
That's market value.
The guy's never talked.

57
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:50,628
Aside from that, I, we are still
uncomfortable with the arrangement.

58
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:51,958
Why?

59
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,636
You just spent a very
public seven days in jail

60
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,964
for a very public
contempt-of-court citation.

61
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:00,551
For protecting sources. If you
were uncomfortable with the story,

62
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,353
why did you slap it on the
domestic and international covers?

63
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:07,478
What makes us uncomfortable
is that a rapist/murderer

64
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,901
has asked to spend the last
three days of his life

65
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,274
giving an interview,
his very first,

66
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,947
to a reporter who is now famous

67
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,657
for protecting sexual deviants.

68
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,406
A reporter who is also
a very attractive woman.

69
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,112
This is disparate treatment.

70
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,830
Oh, boy.

71
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,657
I could go if I
were an ugly guy?

72
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,040
The agenda issue would be diffused
with the presence of a male.

73
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,496
I hear lawyers
gleefully saying,

74
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,999
"Bloom versus
<i>News Magazine</i> Inc."

75
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,631
"Your Honor, I started
to notice my assignments

76
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,962
"were being determined
on the basis of my sex."

77
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,672
You've got to let her go now.

78
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,007
That's not what I meant.

79
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,428
He's got to let you go.

80
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,602
All right. Enough.

81
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,351
But the intern will be
with you at all times.

82
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,147
What? Intern.

83
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,814
No, you've got to be kidding.
That's what he said.

84
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,519
He's a jerk.
He's the boss.

85
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,650
Not an intern.
I always work alone.

86
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:55,855
Not this time, Bitsey.

87
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,316
I'm not baby-sitting.

88
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,169
Gale's DNA was everywhere.
His semen was inside her.

89
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,845
He was seen leaving her house.

90
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,890
His prints were all over the
kitchen, including one on the bag.

91
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,387
Half a thumbprint.

92
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,976
Half a thumbprint.
That's enough.

93
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,520
He could've touched it before
it was a murder weapon.

94
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,564
You fondle your
friends' garbage bags?

95
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,188
Yeah, I get very touchy
around household plastics.

96
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,235
I'm particularly
fond of Tupperware.

97
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,528
Tupperware?

98
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:39,825
I'm just saying the bag could've
been sitting on the counter.

99
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,578
He did it. Now he's going to die.
And you know something?

100
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,621
Maybe that's exactly
what he deserves.

101
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,745
But the murder's way
too fucking clumsy.

102
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:52,000
This guy is an intellectual. Top of
his Harvard class, Rhodes Scholar,

103
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,752
tenured at 27,
two books published.

104
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,504
He's an academic stud.

105
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,174
Look at his wife.
A regular Grace Kelly.

106
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,802
Old money svelte. Father
was ambassador to Spain.

107
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,849
Shit! The light's on again.

108
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,843
Ignore it, it's a rental.

109
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,845
Do you smell anything?

110
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,597
The guy's a flaming Liberal.

111
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,432
A person's politics
has nothing to do

112
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,607
with his tendency
to commit crime.

113
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:14,772
Wrong.

114
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,774
Shouldn't it smell
if it's overheating?

115
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,777
Seventy-three percent of all
serial killers vote Republican.

116
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,234
Throw your cigarette out,
so we can smell.

117
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,117
You'll stink up the car.
Throw it out.

118
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,994
I'm not going to
fucking pollute.

119
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,557
There's definitely
something wrong with this car.

120
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:47,976
This is so irritating.

121
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,473
How far to Huntsville?

122
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,429
I'm going to pull off.

123
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:55,101
<i>"News Magazine</i> reporters

Call the office and get the

133

No signal.

134

God damn it.

Yeah?

139
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,145
Morning.
Hi.

140
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,321
A little early
for that, isn't it?

141
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,070
The nonsmoking
section's over there.

142
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,114
I meant the book.

143
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,954
<i>Dialogical Exhaustion</i>
by David Gale.

144
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,290
The guy's a genius.

145
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,037
What time is it?

146
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,205
9:15 a.m.

147
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,833
There are 10
prisons around here.

148
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,706
Death row is in the Ellis unit,

149
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,963
but they're moving it to the Terrell
unit at the end of the year.

150
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,794
The waitress's
boyfriend works there.

151
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,130
Her last boyfriend worked
in the Huntsville unit.

152
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,056
The two before that in Walker.

153
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,305
The Estelle unit
has the cutest guys.

154
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:38,434
And I'm quoting, "My butt's too
big to get an Estelle guy."

155
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,316
Ellis is 15 minutes
out of town.

156
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,060
We've got five
and a half hours.

157
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:47,239
Never eat in a place where the
menus have pictures of the food.

158
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,238
We should drive into Austin.
Check out the crime scene.

159
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,910
That could be some
great stuff for our story.

160
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,581
This isn't our story. It's not even
a story. It's an interview.

161
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:00,911
Most importantly for you to
remember, it's my interview.

162
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,002
What do I do for
the next five hours?

163
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,630
Drive around. Look for
a decent restaurant.

164
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,090
Your reputation as
Mike Wallace with PMS

165
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,675
doesn't do you justice.

166
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,847
My reputation got
us invited here.

167
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,679
I play by the rules, even if
my colleagues don't like it.

168
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,355
It's called...
Ambition?

169
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,432
Objectivity.

170
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,767
What can I get you, ma'am?

171
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,109
Just coffee.

172
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,199
Don't push me, smart ass.

173
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,629
You know you're
in the Bible belt

174
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,836
when there are more
churches than Starbucks.

175
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,297
When there are more
prisons than Starbucks.

176
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,011
He's ready for y'all now.

177
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,338
Yes, I am.

178
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:25,313
I'm not gonna debate with you the
rights and wrongs of the situation.

179
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,558
Our job is to run the
state prison system.

180
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,901
This is not France. This is not
Germany. This is Texas.

181
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,074
And we're gonna
follow Texas law.

182
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,364
You're very welcome, ma'am.
Goodbye, now.

183
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,905
Thank you, Margie.

184
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,412
Correspondents Bloom and
Stevens, I presume?

185
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,788
Yes, hello.

186
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,745
Stemmons.

187
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,413
Sorry.
Won't happen again.

188
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,340
I'm Duke Grover, TDCJ,
Community Relations.

189
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,544
He's usually real
good with names.

190
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,220
And these days I
always like to ask

191
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,674
do you prefer Miss,
Mrs., or Ms.?

192
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,383
Bitsey.

193
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,555
Bitsey it is.

194
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,931
Margie, I'm stealing
your guests.

195
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,350
Okey-dokey.

196
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,765
You ever been in a prison?
Yes.

197
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,316
On death row?
No.

198
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,230
ID's again, please.

199
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:16,406
All executions in the state of Texas
occur at the Huntsville unit.

200
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,984
But death row is here
for the time being.

201
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:22,742
This is home to all 442
offenders prior to their date.

202
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,331
Average stay on
the row is nine years.

203
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,205
Some get commuted, but
most get put to death.

204
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,464
It'll put you off your supper,
but then, it's supposed to.

205
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,757
New York
guests for Mr. Gale.

206
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,467
Can I get your bags?

207
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:40,422
We have three concerns here,
safety, safety, and safety.

208
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,599
The visitation area
is entirely secure.

209
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,846
We just ask that you
don't touch the glass.

210
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,678
Windex gets expensive.

211
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,689
You're not carrying a
weapon, are you, Bitsey?

212
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,018
Sorry. No.

213
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,350
Mr. Stemmons, you packing?

214
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,396
No, sir.

215
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,446
Cell phone?

216
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,562
They're not working.

217
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,904
Then you won't mind
leaving them here.

218
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,487
We also have rules against the
carrying of large sums of cash

219
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,743
and the wearing
of open-toed shoes.

220
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,085
Those will do just fine. You
want to step on through now?

221
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,794
There you go.

222
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,288
Thank you, ma'am.

223
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,506
That's right.

224
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,133
Open-toed shoes?

225
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,343
Drives them crazy.

226
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,422
Your turn, Mr. Stemmons.
Right on through there.

227
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:23,673
Good.

228
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,553
Should anything unpleasant
occur in the visitation area,

229
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,262
we ask you to stay put.

230
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,565
Please follow the instructions of
our fine correctional officers

231
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,813
should they see fit
to give you any.

232
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,317
Anything you say
can be overheard.

233
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:42,651
Any discussion of criminal activity
on your part is admissible.

234
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,532
You're not planning on
a jailbreak, are you?

235
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,497
The rain seems
to be holding off.

236
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:52,203
You watch your step here. This
cement can get pretty slippery.

237
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,545
This is our Japanese garden.

238
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:57,875
We ask you not to
throw coins in the pond.

239
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,882
Right this way.
Almost there.

240
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:07,263
Here we are. This is our
visitation area right here.

241
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,394
All yours, Mr. Belyeu.

242
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,690
That's it for me. You
folks have a safe visit.

243
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,771
Thank you.
Bye now.

244
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,397
- Ms. Bloom?
- Yes.

245
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,063
Come right on in here and
make yourself comfortable.

246
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,444
Did that PR man
validate your parking?

247
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,651
He said the gift
shop would do it.

248
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,614
She's a smart one.

249
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,913
Braxton Belyeu,
Mr. Gale's attorney.

250
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,160
This is Zack Stemmons.

251
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,453
My good pleasure.

252
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,581
And right over here,
we have the man of the hour.

253
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,387
Hello.

254
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,089
Hello.
Hi.

255
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:50,264
<i>Sit down, Gale.
Prisoner will not stand.</i>

256
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,562
Why can't they
turn that thing down?

257
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,185
My lawyer respectfully requests

258
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,108
that you adjust the volume
on the speaker system.

259
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,063
<i>Gale, sit down.</i>

260
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,903
They're practicing
being cruel and unusual.

261
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,448
I'm sure you're
biting at the bit.

262
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,375
It is our understanding
that you are

263
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,290
to have three
two-hour sessions.

264
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,872
Today, tomorrow, and Thursday.

265
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,957
All at 3:00 p.m.

266
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,047
I'm sorry we can't
afford you more time.

267
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,756
But contrary to popular rumor,
we have not yet begun to fight.

268
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,058
It is our understanding
that you will do this alone.

269
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,227
The magazine would prefer that...
Alone.

270
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,394
Understood.

271
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,397
Also, you'll use no
recording equipment of any kind.

272
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,193
- Correct.
- Excellent.

273
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:44,364
I have a few papers for which
I need your Jo Anne Hancock.

274
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:48,784
So if you'd stop by my Austin office
at your earliest convenience.

275
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,486
Thursday morning, say?

276
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,329
Expenses and so forth.

277
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,332
Fine. Till Thursday, then.
Good luck.

278
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,171
I'll stop by later.

279
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:06,298
What say you and me partake
of a death-defying cigarette

280
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:08,254
in the visitors' parking lot?

281
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,429
Bye-bye, y'all.

282
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,015
So...

283
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,642
Please pull up a seat.

284
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,449
He's quite a character.

285
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,526
Yes.

286
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,284
He's about the only outside
contact I have now.

287
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,739
And a good friend.

288
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,791
Where's your ex-wife?

289
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:41,087
I don't want you to ask me
questions about her or my son.

290
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,464
What I offer you is one thing.

291
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,133
Questions about them
are not part of our deal.

292
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,209
Okay.

293
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,964
Just say, "Off the record,"
and I'll take it to my grave.

294
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:52,594
You can trust me on that.

295
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,977
Does this count as
recording equipment?

296
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:00,894
How do we start?

297
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,187
We start with

298
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,774
you telling me
what I'm doing here.

299
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,865
No one who looks through
that glass sees a person.

300
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,317
They see a crime.

301
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,496
I'm not David Gale.
I'm a murderer and a rapist.

302
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,744
Four days shy of his execution.

303
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,827
You're here because I
want to be remembered

304
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:25,131
as much for howl led my life
and the decisions that I made

305
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,254
as for how my life ended.

306
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,634
Why me?

307
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:30,924
Why not?

308
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,597
You've spent some time behind
bars yourself recently.

309
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,141
I certainly have.

310
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,594
Because you do take
things to your grave.

311
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,015
Protecting sources, even kiddie
porn scum, is the magazine policy

312
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,771
and mine.
I know.

313
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,394
That's your reputation.

314
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,278
I have a hard story for
you to tell, Miss Bloom.

315
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,235
It's not going to be easy.

316
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,156
Where do we begin?

317
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:03,377
I should tell you how
I became Head of Philosophy

318
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,170
<i>at the University of Austin.</i>

319
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,345
<i>Come on, think.</i>

320
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,924
<i>I want you to reach
back into those minds.</i>

321
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,349
<i>And tell me, tell us all,</i>

322
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,138
what is it that
you fantasize about?

323
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,310
World peace?

324
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,148
Thought so.

325
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,603
Do you fantasize about
international fame?

326
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,571
Do you fantasize about
winning a Pulitzer Prize?

327
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,073
Or a Nobel Peace Prize?

328
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,121
An MTV Music Award?

329
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:44,161
Do you fantasize about
meeting some genius hunk

330
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:48,248
ostensibly bad, but secretly
simmering with noble passion

331
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,674
and willing to sleep
on the wet spot?

332
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,419
I'll take two!
What was that?

333
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,674
I'll take two!

334
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,009
Kimberley will take two.

335
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,515
You get Lacan's point.

336
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,270
Fantasies have
to be unrealistic.

337
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,598
Because the moment, the second
that you get what you seek,

338
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,400
you don't,
you can't want it anymore.

339
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,945
In order to continue to exist,

340
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,070
desire must have its objects
perpetually absent.

341
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:19,029
It's not the "it" that you want,
it's the fantasy of "it."

342
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:23,704
Desire supports
crazy fantasies.

343
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,456
Sorry.

344
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,261
This is what Pascal means when he
says that we are only truly happy

345
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,805
when daydreaming
about future happiness.

346
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:39,928
It came today.

347
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,760
Or why we say, "The hunt
is sweeter than the kill."

348
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,686
Or, "Be careful
what you wish for."

349
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,639
Not because you'll get it,

350
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,726
because you're doomed
not to want it once you do.

351
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,311
So the lesson of Lacan is

352
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,988
living by your wants
will never make you happy.

353
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,907
What it means to be fully human

354
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,826
is to strive to live
by ideas and ideals.

355
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,996
Not to measure your life

356
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:05,245
by what you've attained
in terms of your desires

357
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:10,581
but those moments of integrity,
compassion, rationality,

358
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,170
even self-sacrifice.

359
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:14,717
Because in the end,

360
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:18,547
the only way we can measure the
significance of our own lives

361
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:21,098
is by valuing
the lives of others.

362
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,764
All right,
I'll see you all on Monday.

363
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:52,205
Sorry about being late.

364
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,420
There was, you know, a thing.

365
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,632
There usually is, Berlin.

366
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:02,181
I know that I'm
not doing too well.

367
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:07,224
And to torture a cliché,

368
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,481
I would do anything to pass.

369
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,737
Anything?

370
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:22,409
Anything.

371
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:26,865
Okay, Berlin.

372
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:36,132
I will give you
a very good grade

373
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,759
if you would just

374
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,135
study.

375
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:57,357
The TA's transcribed the
Governor's radio and TV comments.

376
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,063
Listen to this gem.

377
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,274
"Journalist,
'Governor, don't you think

378
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,530
"'three executions in
one week is excessive?'

379
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:07,785
"Governor, 'I say bring 'em in, strap
'em down, and let's rock and roll."'

380
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,958
It's good that our governor's in
touch with his inner frat boy.

381
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:13,206
Will you tell me why you're
not doing this debate?

382
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,083
Telegenics.
You have a cuter butt.

383
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,835
I hadn't noticed.
I know.

384
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:18,837
I didn't mean that.

385
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,418
I've highlighted some stuff.

386
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,810
He'll do the whole
down-home wisdom thing.

387
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,889
"Capital punishment is God's law,"
"An eye for an eye" and all.

388
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:36,476
Stick to arguments about rational
facts and watch your ego.

389
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,269
Don't come across as,

390
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:40,946
"I hate authority because
everyone here wears big hats,

391
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,399
"and nobody in charge
reads The New Yorker."

392
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:44,483
Anything else?

393
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,568
I'm getting new stats
from Amnesty tonight.

394
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,825
Bring them by Greer's party.

395
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,577
I have papers to grade.

396
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,394
If you have
a hangover tomorrow...

397
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,701
I'm walking away.

398
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:55,001
10:00 a.m.

399
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,621
Bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed!

400
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,042
Bushy-tailed!

401
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,513
Hey, Jamie. Did you
mark your calendar yet?

402
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,973
I sure did.

403
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:20,770
One, two, three, four more
days until Mom comes home.

404
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:24,073
Only four more days?
That's great news.

405
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:28,236
Can I ask you something?
It's really important.

406
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,740
Of course you can.

407
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,243
Can we have
pancakes for breakfast?

408
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:37,127
With syrup and strawberries?

409
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,749
We'll have to see.

410
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,373
And chocolate shavers?

411
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,959
No, it's chocolate shavings.

412
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,632
And whipped cream?

413
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:46,879
Whipped cream?

414
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,761
That's a lot of requests
for one little boy.

415
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,846
Why don't you go to sleep?

416
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,643
Do Cloud Dog, too.

417
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:55,479
Good night, Cloud Dog.

418
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,897
There you go.

419
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,349
You go to sleep.

420
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,684
Good night.

421
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,779
Don't forget to feed the fish.

422
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,318
What?

423
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,990
Don't forget to feed the fish.

424
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,742
Okay.

425
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,530
I'll be back before midnight.

426
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,582
Here's the number if
you have to reach me.

427
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,501
There's chicken in the
refrigerator, if you want some.

428
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,296
That's fine. Maybe I'll fix
myself something later.

429
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,748
Bye.
Bye.

430
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,720
Dad, did you feed the fish?

431
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:34,302
Yes, I did.
Now go to sleep.

432
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,367
He's the Immanuel
Kant of the NFL.

433
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,365
He's consistent,
accurate, effective,

434
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,412
and let's not forget boring.

435
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:55,535
He is boring.

436
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,789
If you want boring,

437
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,414
read William Bennett's Book of Virtues.
I'm still asleep.

438
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:00,665
Someone wake me up.

439
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,041
John, how are you?

440
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,379
Where's your better half?

441
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:06,717
My wife?
She's in Spain.

442
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,794
Again? I am sorry.

443
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,630
John, have you seen Alma?
She's been looking for you.

444
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,557
My wife's affair is just
this big, open secret.

445
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:16,469
Hermeneutical bias.

446
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:19,271
The only fun truths are the
ones someone's trying to hide.

447
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,565
She's been to Barcelona
four times this year.

448
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,517
I don't think she's
trying to hide anything.

449
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,318
Her father is the ambassador.

450
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:28,022
Yeah, except the
embassy's in Madrid.

451
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,570
By the way, Berlin's here.

452
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,193
Pretty livid.
Why?

453
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,746
We've expelled her.
She got the letter today.

454
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,324
Took the opportunity to
throw a fit in my office.

455
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,250
Talking about me?

456
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,952
As a matter of fact, we were.

457
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,379
Did he tell you I said
when you were circumcised

458
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,548
they threw away the wrong part?

459
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,375
Yes, he mentioned it.

460
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,381
It's called schmuck.
What?

461
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,634
The part of the foreskin they
throw away after circumcision.

462
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:55,011
It think it's called schmuck.

463
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,717
Aren't we so fucking clever.

464
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,469
Perhaps I should get another.

465
00:27:58,552 --> 00:27:59,804
Black Bush.

466
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:02,185
You were a jerk this afternoon.

467
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,726
I didn't know about the
expulsion till just now.

468
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,937
Is that supposed
to be an apology?

469
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,067
No.

470
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,946
It's more like a conciliation.

471
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:38,092
Ross! Ross!

472
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,311
All right.

473
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:45,312
"As the poets
have mournfully sung

474
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,353
"Death takes the innocent young

475
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,988
"The screamingly funny
The rolling in money

476
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,987
"And those who
are very well hung"

477
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:05,120
Gale! Gale!

478
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:10,337
"There once was
a lesbian from Cancún.

479
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:14,049
"Who took a young man
up to her room

480
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,380
"Where they argued all night
as to who had the right

481
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,682
"To do what and
how much and to whom"

482
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,350
Enough!

483
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,105
I'm spent!

484
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,182
I have no more.

485
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,902
Ross! Ross!

486
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,304
Okay, I'm finished.
I'm done.

487
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,230
I'm not a student anymore.

488
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:11,523
I do not think I want
to know what that means.

489
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,530
"There once was
a girl named Berlin

490
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,659
"Who liked a bit now and again

491
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,986
"Not now and again

00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,740
"But now and again

493
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,829
"And again"

494
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,493
Cute?

495
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,959
Yeah. Very cute.

496
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:33,958
I have a secret.

497
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,343
But I have to come
over there to tell you.

498
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:38,420
No.

499
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,305
Here...

500
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,800
You stay back.
...I come.

501
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,093
Woman.

502
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:48,689
You should stay...

503
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,608
I wasn't after the grade.

504
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,573
I don't think this is such a...

505
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,612
Now we can talk, analyze,

506
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:05,864
contemplate.

507
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,246
Or you can put
your mouth on my body.

508
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,204
Don't reject me.

509
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:14,748
Please.

510
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:39,023
Rip them.
What?

511
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:40,323
Rip them off.

512
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,761
No. From behind.

513
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:06,846
From behind.

514
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,191
Do it hard.

515
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,580
Harder.

516
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,077
Bite my shoulder.

517
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,970
Thanks for coming, people.

518
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:55,221
I don't care where you go.

519
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,308
Come on!

520
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,611
All right, you guys, it's time
to go home! Good night!

521
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:10,698
It won't work.
That's a faulty argument.

522
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,659
Let's say we found an innocent on
death row. What would change?

523
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,336
After the retrial, the Governor
would go on TV and say,

524
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,665
"See? Thanks to the good people
at Deathwatch, the system works."

525
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:22,718
If we had absolute proof that
he had executed an innocent,

526
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,511
we could demand a moratorium,
like in Illinois.

527
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,468
Are you okay?

528
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:28,636
Sorry. Yeah.

529
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,058
But that won't happen.

530
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,977
Dead men can't make a case, and
almost-martyrs don't count.

531
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:34,976
Got it.
So keep it rational.

532
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:36,894
And stop that!

533
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:38,767
What?

534
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,773
Active listening.
I hate active listeners.

535
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,856
They're too busy pretending to
listen to hear what I'm saying.

536
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,407
I can listen and
actively listen

537
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:46,946
at the same time.
I'm good at it.

538
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,740
Did you bring the Amnesty stats?
Yes.

539
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,866
No. I left them at home.

540
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,412
I have a copy.

541
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:02,281
You want to tell me what's up?

542
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:03,458
Nothing.

543
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,543
Everything.

544
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:12,221
Something profoundly stupid
happened last night.

545
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,927
I hope you used a condom.

546
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,683
Jesus Christ, David.

547
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,812
Was she one of yours?

548
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:26,819
It was Berlin.

549
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:28,946
Great.

550
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,828
That's great.

551
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,573
I can hear the grapevine,

552
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,203
"They suspended
her so Gale could

553
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,871
"dick her with
a clear conscience.

554
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:39,749
"A power differential
equals coercion."

555
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,626
That is great.
You're so weak.

556
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,707
You're not my wife,
Constance. Thank God.

557
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,464
Don't worry, it's not a position
I aspire to. So fuck you!

558
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,716
I didn't mean it that way.
Are you okay?

559
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,257
Really?
Yes! Let's go.

560
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:57,600
There are 17,000 murders a
year in the United States.

561
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,307
Ten states that have
abolished the death penalty

562
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,893
have a murder rate lower
than the national average.

563
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:05,650
If he starts with the religious
stuff, just say that

564
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:09,700
nearly every denomination in the U.S.
opposes the death penalty.

565
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,402
Are you listening?
Yes.

566
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:26,128
All right, 10 seconds.

567
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,380
Count them in, Mac.

568
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,717
Five, four...

569
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,807
<i>Welcome back to Batter's Box.</i>

570
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:42,937
We continue our special four-part
program with Governor Hardin.

571
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,735
And arguing capital
punishment with him

572
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,110
is deathwatch regional
co-director, Professor David Gale.

573
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:50,691
You are up, Governor.

574
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:53,994
I always say the same thing and
I'm gonna keep on saying it.

575
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:57,494
I hate killing, and my
administration will kill to stop it.

576
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,407
How about it?

577
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,745
Murderers are not deterred
by the thought of execution.

578
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,956
You know it. Every single
study done on the subject,

579
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:08,212
and there's been over 200,
you've read them,

580
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,293
has reached
the same conclusion.

581
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:12,175
Maybe you should
read your Bible.

582
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,678
Deuteronomy: 19:21. "An eye for
an eye, a tooth for a tooth."

583
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:18,510
What did Gandhi say about that?

584
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:22,143
"The old law of an eye for
an eye leaves us all blind."

585
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:26,193
I'm sorry, and with respect,
that's fuzzy liberal thinking.

586
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,860
You believe that?
Of course.

587
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,779
Interesting, 'cause you said it

588
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,781
in a speech in
your first campaign.

589
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,777
He got you there, Governor.
How about it?

590
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,577
Yes, he did.

591
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:39,372
"If you're not a Liberal at
30, you've got no heart.

592
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,950
"If you're still a Liberal
at 40, you've got no brain."

593
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,080
That's Winston Churchill.

594
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,248
Touché.

595
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,421
What you're
essentially saying is,

596
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,540
and this is to
choose another quote,

597
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:52,753
"A healthy society must stop at
nothing to cleanse itself of evil."

598
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,550
Yes, I'd have to agree.

599
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:01,686
Did I say that, too?
No, sir. That was Hitler.

600
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:08,936
Governor, can't we all just admit
the capital punishment system

601
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,611
in this country is not working?

602
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,439
We are condemning
people to death

603
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,316
based on phony expert testimony

604
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:17,198
on junk science,
on jailhouse snitches.

605
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:21,498
Did you know Texas has the highest
per capita incarceration rate

606
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,541
in the world, including in China?

607
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,415
Forty-three people,
Governor, that you executed

608
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,794
were represented by lawyers at one
time disbarred or sanctioned.

609
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:32,422
There are two men on death
row right now, on this day,

610
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,754
whose lawyers fell asleep
during their cross-examination.

611
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:36,804
I'm not a lawyer.

612
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,974
Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals ruled

613
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,551
that it was not
a basis for a retrial.

614
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,979
Governor, that's just a
flawed, insane, crazy system.

615
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,648
And a flawed system
will kill innocent men!

616
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,476
All right.
Let him answer.

617
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,069
All right,
we'll play your game.

618
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:53,146
Name one.

619
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,073
Name one innocent
man that Texas

620
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,783
has put to death
during my tenure.

621
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:59,202
Of the 100 or so executions...

622
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,450
That's 131,
in case you've lost count.

623
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:02,872
Let him finish.

624
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,286
Fine. Whatever.

625
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:07,209
Just give me a name.
I'm gonna write it down.

626
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,163
A man that you can
prove was innocent,

627
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,758
and I'll call a moratorium.

628
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:17,337
Mr. Gale?

629
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,515
Are we through here, Alan?

630
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:22,805
We're running out of time.

631
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:24,886
I'd like to thank my guests,
Governor Hardin

632
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,846
and Professor Gale from deathwatch.

633
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:27,977
Roll credits.

634
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:30,058
I hope you will join me tomorrow.

635
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,313
Your exact words were,

636
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,899
"Tell me when my ego's getting
in the way of the work."

637
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,655
Now I'm telling you.

638
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,494
I didn't want to do this.

639
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,242
You put up two
seconds of protest

640
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,077
at the thought of
being on a TV debate.

641
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,282
What does that mean?

642
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,533
Deathwatch suffers

643
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,745
because you're so anxious
to finger authority

644
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:53,298
to publicly prove David Gale is
smarter than the powers that be.

645
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,794
Work without an audience. Try
squeezing money from the donor list.

646
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,844
Have you licked a single
mail-out envelope?

647
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,092
Mr. Gale?

648
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:01,339
The Governor went that way.

649
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,676
Ramirez. Austin Police.
This is Officer Hasermann.

650
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,727
Is debating the
Governor a crime now?

651
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:08,271
No, sir. Rape is.

652
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:17,523
Berlin had my bite marks...

653
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,323
<i>Gale, time's up.</i>

654
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,411
bruises, her clothes
were ripped.

655
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,488
My skin was found
under her fingernails.

656
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:27,370
It didn't look like
anything but rape.

657
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,792
Then she drops charges
and leaves town,

658
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,370
making it look
like I was guilty,

659
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,955
and she was too
traumatized to face trial.

660
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,884
My wife read all this sitting in
the airport wondering where I was.

661
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,552
Why I wasn't there
to pick her up.

662
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,130
Took me almost two
weeks to get bailed out.

663
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:46,301
And the grad student, Berlin?
Why do you think she did it?

664
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:49,100
To poke her
finger at authority.

665
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,806
Show the powers that be
how much smarter she was.

666
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,268
Grad student's revenge.
I don't really know.

667
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,360
Know where I can find her?
No.

668
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:59,815
First year I was in here I got
a postcard from San Francisco.

669
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:03,318
It was signed, "From the student
who would do anything."

670
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,987
Did she say anything else?

671
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:08,573
"I'm sorrier
than you can know."

672
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:09,999
Move it, Gale.

673
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,284
I'm running out of time.

674
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:21,086
Can you imagine his wife letting
him stew in jail for two weeks?

675
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,887
Who can blame her?

676
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,681
Get an address for the Berlin
girl from the university.

677
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,634
Still don't think
he's telling the truth?

678
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:30,015
On the Berlin rap?
On the whole rap.

679
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:33,439
Who knows? Anyway, there is
no truth, only perspectives.

680
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,312
If you say there's no truth,

681
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,143
you're claiming it's
true there's no truth.

682
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,853
It's a logical contradiction.

683
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:41,281
Working on our
philosophy merit badge?

684
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:44,109
With rape, an accusation
is as good as a conviction.

685
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,614
It sticks like shit.

686
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,036
That's an appetizing metaphor.

687
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,408
Technically a simile.

688
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:50,240
I think he's telling the truth.

689
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,371
This you know from sitting
in the prison lobby?

690
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,952
It's just my perspective.

691
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:56,629
Three different
courts found him guilty.

692
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:59,127
That's enough
perspective for me.

693
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,041
What? 330... What?

694
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:35,793
Seven.

695
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,335
3303.

696
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:42,383
3305.

697
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,586
3307. Right there.

698
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,392
Jesus, look at the sign.

699
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:08,906
Hi. I'm Bitsey Bloom.
This is Zack Stemmons.

700
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:10,407
You want the tour?

701
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:14,958
There's a $20 mandatory
donation apiece.

702
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:18,628
You get a re-enactment photo packet.
It's got five pictures.

703
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:20,876
Okay.
I got to collect first.

704
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:21,956
Sure.

705
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,007
I got it.

706
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,890
Got to sign the book. It doesn't
have to be your real name.

707
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,809
It says you're here to do
research on violent crime.

708
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:36,183
State requires it
for nonprofit shit.

709
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:40,517
Take a re-enactment
photo packet.

710
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,568
If you guys could share
one, it would be cool.

711
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:45,112
The fuckers that do my
prints jerk my chain.

712
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:47,862
That's me.
My boyfriend took it.

713
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,692
We also got a video.

714
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:52,746
It's $50 'cause
you can see my tits.

715
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,743
There's a version
without tits. It's $35.

716
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,575
Do many people take the tour?

717
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,418
Not so much anymore.

718
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:01,167
We thought it
would be a busy week

719
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,002
with Gale getting
the prune juice.

720
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:05,254
So you don't mind living here?

721
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:08,257
It's better than living
with my dickwad parents.

722
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:09,838
It starts over here.

723
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,594
She let him
crash here sometimes.

724
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,550
He was constantly wasted.

725
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:16,261
Exhibit one.

726
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:18,062
He drank Scotch religiously.

727
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,357
The rest is in the kitchen.

728
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:24,606
Here's number two.

729
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,692
This is where the tripod was.

730
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:29,695
My boyfriend borrowed the one
we usually show to folks.

731
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:33,244
They never found a camera, or
photos, a video or anything.

732
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,492
Gale must have buried them.

733
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:39,952
These serial killer dudes take
photos to whack off to later.

734
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,371
He's not exactly
a serial killer.

735
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,502
Whatever.

736
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,673
She was totally naked,
right here.

737
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,049
The meter man saw
her through the door.

738
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,257
Gale handcuffed her,
taped her mouth,

739
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,889
then taped a bag over her
head so she couldn't breathe.

740
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:59,892
He used housewife gloves
so he wouldn't leave prints.

741
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:02,645
They found sticky stuff
from the tape on them.

742
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,727
We ask folks not to
touch the exhibit.

743
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:10,148
The totally sick part is where they
found the key to the handcuffs.

744
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,033
We know.

745
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:14,861
Wait. What?
Where was it?

746
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,162
It was in her stomach, dude.

747
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:19,866
Gale made her swallow it
before he bagged her.

748
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:22,748
That's pretty
much the highlights.

749
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:25,250
Got questions?

750
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,760
I can still smell
he cigarette smoke.

751
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:38,176
It's the barbecue!

752
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,180
Can you imagine?

753
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,974
That key was in her stomach.

754
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:47,025
That's so fucking cold, man.

755
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:51,981
- Zack?
- What?

756
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:56,077
Isn't that the cowboy
from the rest area?

757
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,118
The same truck.

758
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,783
Weird coincidence?

759
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,295
Coincidences are always weird.
That's why they're coincidences.

760
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,089
Off the record.

761
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,301
Okay. We're off.

762
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:21,977
Constance was murdered by what's
known as the Securitat Method.

763
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:25,060
You're handcuffed,
forced to swallow the key,

764
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,688
your mouth is taped, a bag
is sealed around your head,

765
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:29,269
and you're left to suffocate.

766
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:31,070
The Securitat
did it to Romanians

767
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,863
when they wouldn't
inform or confess.

768
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:36,034
Sometimes the bag was ripped off
to give you a second chance.

769
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,655
Otherwise, you died

770
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,658
knowing that the
key to your freedom

771
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,788
was inside of you
the entire time.

772
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:44,326
It's a cheap but
effective method.

773
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,042
The problem is

774
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,671
I once mentioned it in
an article that I wrote.

775
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:57,051
Prosecution never knew that.

776
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,349
Someone's framing you?

777
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:01,805
It's more than that.

778
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:05,104
There was a tripod.

779
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:06,806
Right.

780
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:09,309
Facing her body.

781
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,773
Are we back on the record?
Yes.

782
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:15,114
The tripod had no
fingerprints on it.

783
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:18,489
That means somebody brought
it there, set it up,

784
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,820
wiped it clean, and left it.

785
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:22,989
Why?

786
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:26,497
It's as if they wanted me to
know that somewhere out there

787
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:29,545
is a record of exactly what
happened that afternoon.

788
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,338
As if they wanted me to die

789
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:34,714
knowing that the key to my
freedom is out there somewhere.

790
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,680
Maybe you're being paranoid.

791
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:43,134
I used to be the state's leading
death penalty abolitionist.

792
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:46,642
Now I'm on death row! Doesn't
that strike you as a little odd?

793
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:50,274
Any idea who "they" are?

794
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:54,403
No, but I've got
someone working on that.

795
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:58,149
Someone I'm relying on
to prove my innocence.

796
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,950
Belyeu has hired a detective?

797
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:02,571
A journalist.

798
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:05,240
She has to help me.

799
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:10,915
You know I'm innocent.

800
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:12,038
No.

801
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:16,917
No, I don't.

802
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:29,017
Wear me like a fur, Daddy.

803
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:31,144
Okay, who's your hero?

804
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:33,609
All right,
you go get Cloud Dog.

805
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:35,319
Hey, Cloud Dog!

806
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:39,399
Cali me when you land.

807
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,736
Has any couple ever really
survived a trial separation?

808
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,538
Isn't it contrary to the idea
of trying to work things out?

809
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:47,786
Don't.

810
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,743
Get in, sweetie.

811
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:54,876
See you later, alligator.

812
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,419
After a while, crocodile.

813
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:58,217
Take it easy,
Japa-nee-zee.

814
00:47:58,334 --> 00:48:00,086
Okey-dokey,
artichokey.

815
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:02,092
Scoot.

816
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:06,263
Listen.

817
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:07,556
I sent you an e-mail.

818
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,805
An e-mail?

819
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,480
Just read it.

820
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,236
Come on, sweetie.

821
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:04,526
Just read it.

822
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:19,540
You could at
least hide the bottle.

823
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:33,762
Well?

824
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:37,441
Officially,
you're on sabbatical.

825
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,649
Unofficially, they
want you out of here.

826
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:43,197
It was four to two.

827
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,529
How did Ross vote?

828
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:49,866
I'm not supposed to...

829
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,536
Against you.

830
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,257
And you?

831
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:07,880
For you.

832
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,384
And against my politics.

833
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,177
Please.

834
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:53,806
Madam, <i>atención.</i>

835
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,604
My name is David Gale.

836
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,682
I have phoned before, yes?

837
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:02,768
Can...

838
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:12,119
What? No, never mind.

839
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:15,038
Can you please get Sharon Gale?

840
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:17,541
Yes, Miss Gale!

841
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,002
Hello?

842
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:49,774
I wanted to hear your
feedback on the idea.

843
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,568
Look, Professor Gale,

844
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:54,870
I could sit here
like others have,

845
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:57,206
and plead
departmental cutbacks,

846
00:51:57,656 --> 00:52:00,876
claim you need more publications,
I need a minority.

847
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,585
Whatever.

848
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,459
All bull-<i>geschichte.</i>

849
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:07,546
Your record's brilliant.

850
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,593
You're an original
voice, worth,

851
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,633
in today's
scarcity-defines-value,

852
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:15,012
capitalist system under which
we toil, your weight in gold.

853
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:19,054
Hell, it's not even
your alcohol problem.

854
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:23,558
It would be nice to have a faculty
member whose crutch wasn't Prozac.

855
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:27,650
But to speak plain,
if I were to hire you,

856
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:30,151
in the eyes of the
regents, the alumni,

857
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:33,154
and every freshman
with an ear for gossip,

858
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,156
I'd be hiring a rapist.

859
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,495
Those charges were dropped.

860
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,949
People would say
you had a good lawyer.

861
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:42,251
I was innocent.

862
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,586
You don't get it, do you?

863
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:47,256
You're not politically correct.

864
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,292
Welcome to the club.

865
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:55,214
Socrates is sentenced to death.

866
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:00,348
I bet you didn't know that.
He was sentenced to death.

867
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:04,398
But Athenian law
let the condemned

868
00:53:04,473 --> 00:53:07,022
come up with their own
alternate punishment.

869
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,103
Isn't that a great idea?

870
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:12,030
Where are the Athenians
when you really need them?

871
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:15,739
So anyway, Socrates...

872
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:17,786
And he was ugly.
Did I mention that?

873
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:20,956
Did I mention that
Socrates was ugly?

874
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,284
Socrates was ugly,
Plato was fat,

875
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:25,628
and Aristotle was
a prissy dresser.

876
00:53:27,246 --> 00:53:30,841
So anyway, Socrates comes
up with this idea.

877
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:35,137
He says, "What if I pay
a fine instead of death?"

878
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,930
He suggests a fine.

879
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:39,099
All he has to do
in order to live is

880
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,218
to come up with
an appropriately

881
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,894
punitive figure.

882
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:48,067
Guess what he
suggested? $30!

883
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:54,986
Does that make
any sense? $30.

884
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,488
That's 30 mina. That was the
currency of the day, a mina.

885
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,366
Well, minae.

886
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:00,947
That's plural. Minae.

887
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,286
$30!

888
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,917
Thirty pieces of silver.

889
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:10,673
And the judges are so pissed that
more of them voted to kill him

890
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:12,625
than had voted him
guilty in the first place.

891
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,585
That doesn't make any sense.

892
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:17,259
Thirty pieces of silver.

893
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:19,552
Just like the Judas guy.

894
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,725
The Jesus-kisser

895
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,723
who was also a prissy dresser.

896
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,393
Without a successful completion

897
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,182
of an alcohol
treatment program,

898
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,017
you can forget visitation.

899
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:15,150
You'll be lucky to
get a Christmas card.

900
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:17,732
That's if there even
is a custody hearing.

901
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:20,734
What does that mean?

902
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:23,367
If your wife convinces
a Spanish court

903
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:26,870
that you're a danger to the child,
you'll never see him again.

904
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:30,877
He just has to come home.
He's got to come back.

905
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:33,251
Pete, can we have
another round here?

906
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:36,466
I'm fine.

907
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,840
I'll just have to
go get him then.

908
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:46,348
Europe's not Mexico, David. They've
got real borders over there.

909
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:50,021
You might be able to get in, but
getting out with a 6-year-old?

910
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:54,105
That's a whole different
kettle of crawdads.

911
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,982
You want to see Jamie again?

912
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,301
Then you get
your life together.

913
00:55:57,396 --> 00:55:58,613
I'm fine.

914
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:00,653
Pronto.

915
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,119
Who wants to start?

916
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:24,636
Hi, my name is David,

917
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,301
and I am an alcoholic.

918
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:30,388
Hi, David.

919
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:38,191
So, Mr. Gale,

920
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:42,324
tell me three
personal qualities

921
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,242
that you feel you have

922
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:46,946
that would make you a
successful Radio Shed manager.

923
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:50,078
Three.

924
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:54,912
Okay.

925
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:38,622
I'm sorry.

926
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:44,344
I'm sorry. Welcome back.

927
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:45,420
Thanks.

928
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:48,056
You look good.
I feel good.

929
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:52,181
There's something
that you've got to see.

930
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,596
Betty Sue Johnson
has been rescheduled.

931
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,523
Her execution date
is set for the eighth.

932
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:58,646
I have a call with
Washington tonight.

933
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:01,069
If the national director
commits to emergency funds...

934
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,317
She gets commuted and you
prove the system works.

935
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:05,650
But I'll save a life.

936
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,826
Where did you get that bruise?

937
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,199
Just doing chores.

938
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:12,701
Is your cowboy
getting rough with you?

939
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:17,953
There he is.

940
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:21,415
Dusty, does she ever invite you
over and not put you to work?

941
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:27,592
All right, tell me her story.

942
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:29,844
She was sentenced at 17.

943
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:32,893
I really want to get behind this one.
She's so articulate.

944
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:34,015
Who did she kill?

945
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:35,846
She'll put a face
on the death penalty.

946
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,227
Constance, who did she kill?

947
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,058
A cop.

948
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,893
You're crazy.

949
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:45,197
Not just your medium-range, thinks-
she's-Roosevelt's-bath robe,

950
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:49,277
but I mean stark-raving,
screws-loose, in-the-belfry insane!

951
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,906
Seventeen.

952
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,955
Four years before she could
legally drink a beer.

953
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:55,999
But she killed a cop, Constance.

954
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:58,076
Will you help?
Of course.

955
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,330
You're burning up.

956
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,892
Hi, Mr. Gale.

957
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,970
How are you?
It's good to see...

958
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:31,443
Caffeine jolt.
We deliver.

959
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:32,823
Howdy, David.
Howdy, folks.

960
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:36,248
Hello. My, this is service.
Thank you.

961
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:38,621
Gladly. Latte on the left
there for you, John.

962
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,168
Mocha.
Thanks.

963
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:43,129
She's on the phone to Washington.

964
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,248
Sinclair, new National Director.

965
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:50,963
I'm sure we can get some
pulpit time, maybe some cable.

966
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:53,056
<i>Cable's good. Listen, I need to run.</i>

967
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,929
<i>I agree the first press release</i>

968
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,851
<i>should focus on
the woman's youth.</i>

969
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:59,271
<i>I'll have Washington
look into counsel competency.</i>

970
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:02,316
<i>Though I'm almost sure she's
exhausted this on appeal.</i>

971
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,734
<i>See what resources...
David's going to go.</i>

972
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:07,313
<i>I almost forgot.
Gale's not around, is he?</i>

973
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:09,610
No.

974
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:10,948
<i>Good. Keep it that way.</i>

975
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,573
<i>His relationship
with Death Watch is over.</i>

976
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:16,701
<i>Last thing we need is this rape
thing coming back to bite us.</i>

977
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,908
<i>These guys don't stay
on the wagon for long.</i>

978
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:21,001
<i>I'm serious, Constance.</i>

979
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:24,125
<i>Ban him from the premises.
I realize the two of you...</i>

980
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:32,678
David!

981
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:53,818
Sharon, pick up the phone.
I'm begging you.

982
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,447
He's my son, all right?

983
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:57,950
He's my son, too,
and I want to talk to him.

984
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:00,157
You've not let... Hello?

985
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,493
Jamie, is that you?

986
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:05,204
Hey, little moose horn.

987
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,919
I miss you so much.
It's Daddy.

988
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:14,137
Jamie, wait.
Don't hang up the phone!

989
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:16,840
God damn it!

990
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:27,771
Fuck!

991
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:19,615
You scared me.

992
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:21,829
My sheep needs a manager.

993
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:23,911
A manger.

994
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,788
My sheep needs a manger.

995
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:28,704
Are you okay?

996
01:02:31,373 --> 01:02:33,717
I fell off the wagon,
and I hurt myself.

997
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,257
Come on inside.

998
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:47,014
Do you know why St. Jude is the
patron saint of lost causes?

999
01:02:47,097 --> 01:02:49,350
'Cause his real name was Judas.

1000
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:53,104
Judas! There were
two Judases.

1001
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:57,032
Judae, who was the saint
guy, and then the other one,

1002
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:59,780
Judas, who was the bad one.

1003
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:03,864
He's the one who ratted out
Jesus and tried to kiss him.

1004
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:06,621
In medieval times, they would
never pray to the good Judas

1005
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:09,874
for fear of getting the bad Judas
on the line just by mistake.

1006
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:12,752
Ergo, they never
really gave him business

1007
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:14,708
unless absolutely desperate.

1008
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:19,296
That's why. And then
they changed his name.

1009
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:21,761
Your mail is blowing.

1010
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:35,478
Shit.

1011
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:44,113
Are you the doctor?
What's wrong with her?

1012
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:45,162
She'll be fine.

1013
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:47,206
How do you know?
Calm down.

1014
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:50,832
She was opening her mail and fell over.
I don't know what's wrong.

1015
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,378
Please.
Is there a doctor?

1016
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,963
Wait here.

1017
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:55,165
I have to go with her!

1018
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:56,382
Hold up, Professor!

1019
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:58,677
You want to get arrested again?

1020
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,638
How do you know who I am?

1021
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:04,933
I watch the news.
Now go wait.

1022
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:43,717
How're we doing?
Fine. How's Constance?

1023
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:44,798
Sleeping.

1024
01:04:46,091 --> 01:04:47,764
A leukemia patient's
condition is

1025
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:49,435
very susceptible to
external stress...

1026
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:50,512
What?

1027
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:55,479
Constance's illness requires
a degree of regularity.

1028
01:04:58,812 --> 01:05:00,485
Constance has leukemia?

1029
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:03,776
You didn't know?

1030
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:07,495
Wait.

1031
01:05:12,117 --> 01:05:13,334
No, I didn't.

1032
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:25,297
It's funny how selfish
we can be, isn't it?

1033
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:31,804
When I first heard Constance was
dying, I was so mad at her.

1034
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:35,895
I thought, "How can
you do this to me?

1035
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:39,274
"I mean, you know how hard it is
for me to need other people."

1036
01:05:42,147 --> 01:05:43,865
Why hadn't she told you?

1037
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:47,702
She said she was too busy.

1038
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,749
I guess since
death was chasing her,

1039
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:54,918
she wanted to help
other people avoid it.

1040
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:02,042
That's what she
did with her life.

1041
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:10,093
Constance left this world a
better place than she found it.

1042
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:16,724
It's a small but difficult thing.

1043
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:01,943
Let's go.
So, what'd you get?

1044
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:05,022
I talked to the Austin prosecutor.
Belyeu's a joke.

1045
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:08,608
Actually, the exact phrase he
used was, "Big hat, no cattle."

1046
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:10,451
He was sanctioned twice.
What?

1047
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:12,370
Seriously fucked up
the penalty phase.

1048
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:15,073
He could have got life
on mitigating factors.

1049
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:17,033
Despite major pro bono offers

1050
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:18,868
from some of the top
lawyers in the country,

1051
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:20,579
Gale stuck with him all through

1052
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,296
the appeals process,
which by the way,

1053
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:24,625
Belyeu continued to screw up.

1054
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:27,836
So, Belyeu's a joke.
Great.

1055
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:32,216
Anything else?
Nothing on Berlin.

1056
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:34,721
We pick up the payola money
in Houston tonight.

1057
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:36,144
Houston?

1058
01:07:36,261 --> 01:07:37,582
That's what the head office said.

1059
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:39,059
Overheat light came on twice...

1060
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,602
Come on.

1061
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:10,799
Oh, man, I never knew $1
million could weigh so much.

1062
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:12,175
$500,000.

1063
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:13,514
It's still heavy.

1064
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,763
But $1 million sounds
better for our...

1065
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:18,265
Excuse me, your story.
$1 million.

1066
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:20,346
No, wait.
$1 million in cash.

1067
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:22,439
Just relax, Zack.
It's only money.

1068
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,734
So you coming in?

1069
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:35,911
Excuse me?

1070
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:38,740
You want to come in?

1071
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:41,284
Please.

1072
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:44,246
What? I thought you were
into guys with money.

1073
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:49,333
Zack?

1074
01:08:49,417 --> 01:08:50,964
What?
It's open.

1075
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:54,221
Well, maybe the maid forgot.

1076
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:57,550
Look.

1077
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:06,897
We got to call somebody.

1078
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:11,397
Wait.

1079
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:25,578
What is that?
I don't know.

1080
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:43,688
This is not good.

1081
01:09:58,611 --> 01:09:59,783
I'm gonna check the bathroom.

1082
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:01,118
No, Bitsey.

1083
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:02,574
Wait there.

1084
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,156
Bitsey!
What?

1085
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:45,040
Zack, there could
have been prints.

1086
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:46,375
Look.

1087
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:07,055
The lady at reception says
no one asked for you.

1088
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:09,937
All the keys are different. She
and her husband have masters.

1089
01:11:10,016 --> 01:11:11,188
What'd you tell her?

1090
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:12,522
You have a jealous boyfriend.

1091
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:13,694
How about the VCR?

1092
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:14,945
She didn't ask.

1093
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:17,991
I think she assumed it had something
to do with why he was jealous.

1094
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:19,942
You sure we shouldn't
call the cops?

1095
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:21,949
Whoever got in
here without a key

1096
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:23,701
in broad daylight,
was smart enough

1097
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:26,249
not to leave prints.
I have the remote. Here.

1098
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,828
You sure you want to
see what's on here?

1099
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:33,088
Try three.

1100
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:37,339
I hope this isn't
what I think it is.

1101
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:45,475
Oh, my God.

1102
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:50,185
Is it her?

1103
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,398
That's her.

1104
01:12:42,942 --> 01:12:46,116
Belyeu said to bring the
tape first thing tomorrow.

1105
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:51,160
He also said you were right
about not calling the police.

1106
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:58,624
You gonna be all right?

1107
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:25,402
He deserves it
though, probably.

1108
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:27,327
There's a lot of sick
people in this world,

1109
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,155
and if they done
wrong and found guilty...

1110
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,832
All right, let's just say
Gale's telling the truth.

1111
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:33,956
Maybe some right-wing
fuck set him up,

1112
01:13:34,035 --> 01:13:35,412
arranged the perfect murder.

1113
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:37,713
Why would you send a
magazine journalist proof

1114
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:39,085
a few hours before you'd won?

1115
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:40,667
It does not make sense.

1116
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,335
No, it's perfect.

1117
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:46,301
Whoever this is knows how hard
it is to get a retrial in Texas.

1118
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:48,257
They know the magazine
can't give this

1119
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:50,264
any substantial play
before the execution.

1120
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:54,098
We'd have to give it to a daily or
a network. That won't happen.

1121
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:57,354
But mostly, they know
I'll tell Gale today.

1122
01:13:58,225 --> 01:13:59,226
So?

1123
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:04,195
What if Constance's murder was
just a means of getting at Gale?

1124
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:07,322
Not only to get rid of him, but
to make abolitionists look crazy.

1125
01:14:07,401 --> 01:14:10,780
Of course, he sympathizes
with murderers. He is one.

1126
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:13,082
They make sure he sits
six years on death row

1127
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:15,785
for a brutal rape and murder,
then they let him die.

1128
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:18,587
Die knowing everyone will
remember him with disgust.

1129
01:14:18,663 --> 01:14:22,509
They destroy his life, his work,
his memory. And they make him watch.

1130
01:14:24,585 --> 01:14:26,132
That's a lot of hate.

1131
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:29,848
Well, then why release it?

1132
01:14:29,924 --> 01:14:31,642
Hate's no fun if you
keep it to yourself.

1133
01:14:50,778 --> 01:14:51,779
We got company.

1134
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:52,905
Who? The cowboy?

1135
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:56,917
And doing
a lousy job of hiding.

1136
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:59,378
He must think we're idiots.

1137
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:00,917
Is he gaining?

1138
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:02,715
No. He's just
sitting back there.

1139
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:04,584
Get a license plate number.

1140
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:10,594
God, I'm sorry.

1141
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:11,928
He's turned off.

1142
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:14,601
What does this guy want?

1143
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:21,685
Fine. Bobbi, could you make
a quick copy of that videotape

1144
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:24,691
and bring in Miss Bloom's
original when that's done?

1145
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:28,358
I don't blame you for
not watching that twice.

1146
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:29,613
I couldn't sleep afterwards.

1147
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:30,826
I understand.

1148
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:33,495
I tell folks I'm no more
afraid of the Grim Reaper

1149
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:35,949
than I am of a Presbyterian
on Mother's Day.

1150
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:40,253
But watching that tape,
I had to keep telling myself,

1151
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:42,750
"That's not Constance,"
just to get through.

1152
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:45,333
Unfortunately,
others may argue the same.

1153
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:49,212
But it's in her kitchen.
In her house.

1154
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:52,515
But currently home to
Weirdoes Incorporated.

1155
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:55,594
Arguably, that tape could've
been made by anybody with $20

1156
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:57,553
and a tolerance for vulgarity.

1157
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:58,836
Will it get us a postponement?

1158
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:00,060
Us?

1159
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:04,985
This ain't my first rodeo,
Miss Bloom.

1160
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:07,860
Now, I got to tell you that
there's a machine a-running.

1161
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:09,690
And come tomorrow
night at 6:00,

1162
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:11,567
that machine gonna
want to be fed.

1163
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:12,993
All here, Mr. Belyeu.

1164
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:14,453
Thank you, Aaron.

1165
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:17,414
Now, to add to our troubles,
your own credibility

1166
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:18,582
may come into question.

1167
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:19,624
Why?

1168
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,873
You've been fraternizing
with the condemned.

1169
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:23,750
I've been what?
In the court's eyes,

1170
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:26,582
he's the most likely candidate
to have put you onto that tape.

1171
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:29,464
He's a persuasive man. You're
an out-of-state woman.

1172
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:30,920
That don't look good.

1173
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:34,132
Mr. Belyeu, someone put
the tape in my room.

1174
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:36,468
That's a fact for which
we have no evidence.

1175
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:37,676
Thank you, Bobbi.

1176
01:16:37,802 --> 01:16:38,849
Thanks.

1177
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:43,437
Let's not throw a pity party
and sit around reading Kafka.

1178
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:45,814
Could be we find
a sympathetic judge.

1179
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:48,271
Now, I'll file within the hour.

1180
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:50,106
You going to see Gale?
Yeah.

1181
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:51,907
Fine. I'll give you
a call over to

1182
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:53,776
the motel later with an update.

1183
01:17:08,207 --> 01:17:10,005
My coat.
Shoot.

1184
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:30,779
What?
You saw him?

1185
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:31,902
Who?
The cowboy.

1186
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:32,982
He was here?

1187
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:35,818
He's in the lobby! See if his
truck's out front. Tail him.

1188
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:37,653
Get a license number.
Find out who he is.

1189
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:39,488
Don't screw it.
It's important.

1190
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:40,744
But how will you
get to the prison?

1191
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,078
Taxi.

1192
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:28,662
Fuck!

1193
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:34,377
You're not being straight.

1194
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:36,383
I walk out of Belyeu's office,
the guy's in the lobby!

1195
01:18:36,462 --> 01:18:38,055
Maybe you should calm down.

1196
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:40,303
<i>Visitor needs to stay seated.</i>

1197
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:43,803
Maybe you should sit down.

1198
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:52,061
His name is Dusty Wright.

1199
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:54,943
He's the local deathwatch
director before Constance.

1200
01:18:55,022 --> 01:18:57,116
He's a bullhorner.

1201
01:18:57,191 --> 01:18:58,443
He's a zealot who thinks

1202
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:01,995
that a good demonstration has
to end with riots and arrests.

1203
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:05,787
Deathwatch fired him because
he punched someone at a rally.

1204
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:08,460
But Constance kept
him in the organization.

1205
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:12,585
He adored her. They were close.
Real close.

1206
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:16,085
He testified at my trial.

1207
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:19,847
Testified to support you, or
to oppose the death penalty?

1208
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,178
He testified against me.

1209
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:23,721
Against you?

1210
01:19:23,801 --> 01:19:26,020
He testified
about the drinking.

1211
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:28,848
Alcohol is a mitigating
factor in capital cases.

1212
01:19:29,974 --> 01:19:31,942
I always told
myself that he did it

1213
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:35,738
in some sick way to try to help
me get a reduced sentence.

1214
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:39,033
I guess he believes
I really killed her.

1215
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:42,070
Dusty's a man easily
blinded by hatred.

1216
01:19:44,697 --> 01:19:47,576
Maybe he hated you because
you were seeing Constance.

1217
01:19:47,658 --> 01:19:49,376
I wasn't seeing Constance.

1218
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:51,166
She had your semen inside her.

1219
01:19:51,245 --> 01:19:54,374
I know. Look, it's a little
more complicated than that.

1220
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,634
Respect
for life means every life.

1221
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:23,823
<i>When you kill someone,
you rob their family.</i>

1222
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:27,574
<i>Not just of a loved one,
but of their humanity.</i>

1223
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:30,455
<i>You harden their
hearts with hate,</i>

1224
01:20:30,534 --> 01:20:33,959
<i>you take away their capacity
for civilized dispassion,</i>

1225
01:20:34,038 --> 01:20:36,416
<i>you condemn them to bloodlust.</i>

1226
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:40,340
<i>It's a cruel and
horrible thing.</i>

1227
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:44,094
<i>But indulging that
hate will never help.</i>

1228
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:47,555
<i>The damage is done.</i>

1229
01:20:47,634 --> 01:20:50,854
<i>And once we've had our pound
of flesh, we're still hungry.</i>

1230
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:54,308
<i>We leave the death house
muttering that lethal injection</i>

1231
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:56,314
<i>was just too good for them.</i>

1232
01:20:56,393 --> 01:21:00,648
<i>In the end, a civilized society
must live with the hard truth.</i>

1233
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:04,618
<i>He who seeks
revenge digs two graves.</i>

1234
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:07,746
They're bringing Betty Sues people out.

1235
01:21:09,615 --> 01:21:10,958
Thank you, Dusty.

1236
01:21:26,757 --> 01:21:28,805
Just look.
Look at those losers.

1237
01:21:29,343 --> 01:21:33,314
Rednecks, ghetto hustlers,
drug addicts, schizophrenics!

1238
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:36,017
They're murderers!
And who cares if they die?

1239
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:41,322
Who cares if the cycle
just goes on and on?

1240
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:04,929
Hey, did you make it
to your meeting today?

1241
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:08,883
Yeah. But I think I have to
find one less guru-like.

1242
01:22:10,968 --> 01:22:13,221
Did you take your medicine?

1243
01:22:15,389 --> 01:22:16,561
Feel better?

1244
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:26,734
You know those stages
of Kubler-Ross?

1245
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:30,158
The ones the dying go through?

1246
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:36,373
Anger. Denial.

1247
01:22:37,828 --> 01:22:39,296
Bargaining.

1248
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,297
Depression.

1249
01:22:44,418 --> 01:22:45,715
Depression.
Acceptance.

1250
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:47,637
Which one are you?
Denial.

1251
01:22:47,713 --> 01:22:50,182
Denial's good.
That's a good one.

1252
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:54,645
The whole idea of there being
a process makes me tired.

1253
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:58,315
I'm not up to the
job of dying person.

1254
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,734
Marveling at blades of grass,

1255
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:04,063
lecturing strangers
to relish every moment.

1256
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:07,442
Mending bridges.

1257
01:23:08,609 --> 01:23:10,532
Confessing regrets.

1258
01:23:10,611 --> 01:23:11,863
What? No regrets?

1259
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:13,239
Nope.

1260
01:23:15,282 --> 01:23:16,283
Wow.

1261
01:23:18,744 --> 01:23:20,417
I take that back.

1262
01:23:22,206 --> 01:23:23,799
I wish I'd had a child.

1263
01:23:23,916 --> 01:23:25,543
Yeah, so do I.

1264
01:23:25,626 --> 01:23:27,424
I'm sorry, David.
No.

1265
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:34,510
I guess I just wish
I had risked more.

1266
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:38,305
And not enough sex.

1267
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:40,440
I should have had more sex.

1268
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:41,854
Really?

1269
01:23:49,233 --> 01:23:51,076
How many lovers did you have?

1270
01:23:51,151 --> 01:23:52,824
Including college?

1271
01:23:52,903 --> 01:23:54,576
Including college.

1272
01:24:04,581 --> 01:24:07,551
Sex is really... It's not
all it's cracked up to be.

1273
01:24:08,669 --> 01:24:10,137
It's so overrated.

1274
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:14,341
You should have had more sex.

1275
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:20,689
You work so hard not to
be seen as a sex object.

1276
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:24,693
Before long,
you're not seen at all.

1277
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:31,112
I see you.

1278
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:40,075
You want to make it five?

1279
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:43,082
Complete the hand?

1280
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:45,331
What? A pity lay?

1281
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:48,208
No, thanks.

1282
01:24:55,591 --> 01:24:57,093
It wouldn't be pity.

1283
01:25:17,195 --> 01:25:18,447
Are you okay?

1284
01:25:18,572 --> 01:25:19,824
Yeah, don't worry.

1285
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:22,000
No, it's good.

1286
01:25:22,075 --> 01:25:24,624
Just talk to me.
Let me hear your voice.

1287
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:27,752
I'm here. I'm so happy.

1288
01:25:27,873 --> 01:25:31,468
Hold me tight.
God, I'm so scared.

1289
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:34,088
It's okay.

1290
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:35,509
No, don't stop.
Just...

1291
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:37,724
No, stay in me, please.

1292
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:39,260
Okay.

1293
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:43,556
I need just to feel you inside.

1294
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:45,641
I'm right here.

1295
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:47,192
I'm so tired.

1296
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:54,487
I'm so tired of being so afraid.

1297
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:56,409
I know. I'm here.

1298
01:25:57,152 --> 01:26:00,076
Help me. Please.

1299
01:26:01,782 --> 01:26:03,580
Just make it go away.

1300
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,582
I'm right here.

1301
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:13,418
I'm not going anywhere.

1302
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:53,359
Can I help you?

1303
01:27:53,477 --> 01:27:54,524
No.

1304
01:27:54,603 --> 01:27:56,776
I'm leaving.
I'm sorry. Thanks.

1305
01:29:11,304 --> 01:29:12,851
It was Dusty.

1306
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:17,019
He had a motive. He knew you both.
He visited that morning.

1307
01:29:17,102 --> 01:29:19,855
If I could answer
that for sure,

1308
01:29:19,938 --> 01:29:22,737
we wouldn't be
having this conversation.

1309
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:26,700
It's what I need you for.
It's why I chose you.

1310
01:29:26,778 --> 01:29:28,200
Now I've told you everything.

1311
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:29,789
But I still don't know.

1312
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:31,537
I need more time.

1313
01:29:31,658 --> 01:29:33,126
You'll find time.

1314
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:35,958
You should have
done this earlier.

1315
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:38,294
You're not here to save me.

1316
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:41,718
You're here to save my son's
memory of his father.

1317
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:45,138
That's all I want.

1318
01:29:47,465 --> 01:29:49,718
You're gonna let them kill you?

1319
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:53,726
Bitsey, we spend our whole
lives trying to stop death.

1320
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:56,479
Eating, inventing, loving,

1321
01:29:57,309 --> 01:29:59,937
Praying, fighting,

1322
01:30:01,563 --> 01:30:02,564
killing.

1323
01:30:03,815 --> 01:30:06,489
But what do we
really know about death?

1324
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:08,366
Just that nobody comes back.

1325
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:12,457
But there comes
a point in life,

1326
01:30:13,325 --> 01:30:14,622
a moment,

1327
01:30:15,827 --> 01:30:19,001
when your mind
outlives its desires,

1328
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:21,883
its obsessions.

1329
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:25,170
When your habits

1330
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:28,344
survive your dreams.

1331
01:30:31,927 --> 01:30:34,180
And when your losses...

1332
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:42,108
Maybe death is a gift.

1333
01:30:44,856 --> 01:30:46,028
You wonder.

1334
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:47,317
That's it.

1335
01:30:47,859 --> 01:30:48,985
Let's go, Gale.

1336
01:30:54,157 --> 01:30:58,162
All I can tell you is that by
this time tomorrow, I'll be dead.

1337
01:30:59,245 --> 01:31:00,747
I know when.

1338
01:31:02,207 --> 01:31:03,925
I just can't say why.

1339
01:31:06,711 --> 01:31:08,713
You have 24 hours to find out.

1340
01:31:15,053 --> 01:31:16,305
Goodbye, Bitsey.

1341
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:14,033
Miss Bloom?
Yeah.

1342
01:32:16,114 --> 01:32:18,708
Thought I'd return your coat.
It's getting kind of chilly.

1343
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:20,751
Any news from our
video intruder friend?

1344
01:32:20,827 --> 01:32:22,875
No. Any word on the appeal?

1345
01:32:22,954 --> 01:32:25,958
Denied. Tape went to a
federal judge two hours ago.

1346
01:32:26,583 --> 01:32:29,052
Now what you got was
definitely a snippet.

1347
01:32:29,127 --> 01:32:31,129
Could be your
video supplier friend

1348
01:32:31,296 --> 01:32:33,264
has more nasty
previews scheduled.

1349
01:32:33,339 --> 01:32:36,058
Best you not get into too
much sightseeing right now.

1350
01:32:36,134 --> 01:32:38,353
Just stick close
to your motel room.

1351
01:32:42,223 --> 01:32:44,225
How's David?
He's holding up.

1352
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:46,437
Gonna be a hard night.

1353
01:32:46,519 --> 01:32:48,738
Will you tell him
I'll take care of it?

1354
01:32:48,813 --> 01:32:50,360
About his son, I mean.

1355
01:32:50,482 --> 01:32:52,075
I'll do that.

1356
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:54,323
You staying for the execution?

1357
01:32:55,612 --> 01:32:58,161
Then I'll see you tomorrow.
Watch yourselves.

1358
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:05,255
Were Dusty Wright
and Constance close?

1359
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:07,674
Yeah. Thick as thieves,
those two.

1360
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:09,751
Lovers?

1361
01:33:09,876 --> 01:33:11,002
Whoa, now.

1362
01:33:11,086 --> 01:33:13,464
You're plowing a little
too close to the cotton.

1363
01:33:13,546 --> 01:33:15,799
That was just a rumor.
Nothing more.

1364
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:17,258
Night-night.

1365
01:36:20,149 --> 01:36:23,119
Wake up! Did you throw
the towel on the floor?

1366
01:36:23,236 --> 01:36:25,580
What? This towel was
on my bathroom floor.

1367
01:36:25,655 --> 01:36:27,032
Did you throw it there?

1368
01:36:27,156 --> 01:36:28,533
I guess. What?
It's a motel.

1369
01:36:28,574 --> 01:36:30,622
Would you do that at home?
No.

1370
01:36:30,702 --> 01:36:33,455
It's not like we're staying
in the frigging Four Seasons.

1371
01:36:33,538 --> 01:36:36,587
Come on, get the TV.
We're taking it with us.

1372
01:36:36,666 --> 01:36:39,670
What are you talking about?
Where are we going?

1373
01:36:39,752 --> 01:36:41,174
Austin. Get the TV.

1374
01:36:41,296 --> 01:36:42,718
All right.

1375
01:36:47,593 --> 01:36:48,594
Hold on.

1376
01:37:11,617 --> 01:37:12,743
Want to make $100?

1377
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:14,002
What do I got to do?

1378
01:37:14,078 --> 01:37:16,172
We're going
over the crime scene.

1379
01:37:16,873 --> 01:37:18,750
Put the TV on the bed, Zack.

1380
01:37:22,086 --> 01:37:25,511
Now, for the next hour, I want
you to do exactly what I say

1381
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:28,594
when I say to do it. If I
say, "Jump," you jump.

1382
01:37:28,676 --> 01:37:30,519
You want me to jump?
A figure of speech.

1383
01:37:30,595 --> 01:37:32,268
Your boyfriend
put the tripod back.

1384
01:37:32,388 --> 01:37:33,935
He's not my boyfriend anymore.

1385
01:37:34,057 --> 01:37:35,855
Still have the video camera?
Yes.

1386
01:37:35,933 --> 01:37:37,901
Good. Get it. I got
to collect first.

1387
01:37:37,977 --> 01:37:39,729
Zack, give her the money.

1388
01:37:47,779 --> 01:37:49,998
Can you move that stuff
off the counter for me?

1389
01:37:50,073 --> 01:37:52,792
By the lamp.
Yeah, thanks.

1390
01:37:59,207 --> 01:38:00,754
Put the gloves
on the dish rack.

1391
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:02,377
I don't have a dish rack.

1392
01:38:02,919 --> 01:38:04,466
Zack, could you...

1393
01:38:10,218 --> 01:38:11,765
Turn them inside out.

1394
01:38:15,264 --> 01:38:17,437
Put the duct tape on the floor.

1395
01:38:18,851 --> 01:38:20,103
By the stove.

1396
01:38:25,983 --> 01:38:27,906
Could you...
What's your name?

1397
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:29,407
Nico's fine.

1398
01:38:29,904 --> 01:38:34,000
Nico, I want you to lie
down facing the counter.

1399
01:38:35,368 --> 01:38:37,120
We can imagine that part.

1400
01:38:42,834 --> 01:38:43,960
Zack, put her in position.

1401
01:38:44,085 --> 01:38:45,211
Okay.

1402
01:38:49,507 --> 01:38:51,009
Move this way.

1403
01:38:51,092 --> 01:38:52,890
- All right.
- Now forward.

1404
01:38:53,553 --> 01:38:56,181
There. Okay. On her side.

1405
01:38:57,181 --> 01:39:00,230
Right. Her top leg
out a little.

1406
01:39:01,686 --> 01:39:02,778
There.

1407
01:39:06,732 --> 01:39:08,109
Now look at this.

1408
01:39:12,864 --> 01:39:14,741
She moves her foot.

1409
01:39:14,824 --> 01:39:16,918
I noticed this
back at the motel.

1410
01:39:17,702 --> 01:39:20,046
She moves her foot.
Quite deliberately.

1411
01:39:20,830 --> 01:39:22,332
And then she's still.

1412
01:39:22,415 --> 01:39:25,259
For another 15
seconds she's still.

1413
01:39:25,334 --> 01:39:27,177
And then she
starts to struggle.

1414
01:39:27,253 --> 01:39:29,631
That doesn't make sense.
If this was a murder,

1415
01:39:29,714 --> 01:39:33,184
she'd just be struggling and then
she'd be still. She'd be dead.

1416
01:39:33,259 --> 01:39:36,229
Maybe she was faking.
Hoping he'd go away.

1417
01:39:38,598 --> 01:39:39,599
Or...

1418
01:39:43,478 --> 01:39:45,355
We've got to bag her.

1419
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:47,357
We're going a bit too far here.

1420
01:39:55,448 --> 01:39:56,825
I'll do it.

1421
01:40:05,374 --> 01:40:06,876
Thank you, Bobbi.

1422
01:40:20,264 --> 01:40:22,687
Supreme Court death clerk
gave the go-ahead.

1423
01:40:31,817 --> 01:40:34,536
Give the keys to Zack and
stand over by the tripod.

1424
01:40:34,612 --> 01:40:37,035
Wait three minutes before
you take the bag off.

1425
01:40:37,114 --> 01:40:39,492
I'm not sure about this.
It's too dangerous.

1426
01:40:39,575 --> 01:40:42,203
Three full minutes. Stand
over there with her.

1427
01:40:42,912 --> 01:40:44,539
Keep your eyes on your watch.

1428
01:41:19,991 --> 01:41:22,835
Twenty-two seconds.
She shouldn't be doing this!

1429
01:41:42,805 --> 01:41:44,182
Oh, my God.

1430
01:41:50,771 --> 01:41:52,148
This isn't cool!

1431
01:41:56,694 --> 01:41:58,617
No more experiments, all right?

1432
01:41:58,696 --> 01:42:00,118
Just tell me what's going on.

1433
01:42:00,197 --> 01:42:01,369
Are you okay?

1434
01:42:01,532 --> 01:42:02,704
She did it herself.

1435
01:42:32,521 --> 01:42:35,946
She used the gloves to keep her
fingerprints off the tape and bag.

1436
01:42:36,025 --> 01:42:38,323
Then she put them
back on the dish rack.

1437
01:42:38,402 --> 01:42:41,531
But upside down and inside out.
A housewives' habit.

1438
01:42:41,614 --> 01:42:43,787
A murderer would've
tossed them aside

1439
01:42:43,866 --> 01:42:45,994
like you do with
a towel in a crap motel.

1440
01:42:46,077 --> 01:42:47,670
All right, maybe.

1441
01:42:49,246 --> 01:42:51,294
But why wear these?

1442
01:42:51,415 --> 01:42:53,509
They threw me.
But she needed them.

1443
01:42:53,584 --> 01:42:56,588
She knew she would instinctively
try to rip the bag off.

1444
01:42:56,671 --> 01:42:59,174
And she swallowed the key
so she couldn't get to it.

1445
01:42:59,256 --> 01:43:01,850
She made sure
there was no way out.

1446
01:43:01,926 --> 01:43:05,351
Why not hang yourself or take pills?
Why take your clothes off?

1447
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:07,181
Why make it look like a murder?

1448
01:43:07,306 --> 01:43:09,104
I don't know.
It's so calculated.

1449
01:43:09,975 --> 01:43:11,727
She's handcuffed,
taped at the mouth.

1450
01:43:11,811 --> 01:43:13,609
The gloves.
The damn tripod.

1451
01:43:14,063 --> 01:43:16,782
Why fake your own murder?
It doesn't make sense.

1452
01:43:16,857 --> 01:43:19,110
The woman's a
bleeding-heart abolitionist.

1453
01:43:19,193 --> 01:43:20,285
Why frame an innocent man?

1454
01:43:20,361 --> 01:43:21,521
Why send Gale to the chair...

1455
01:43:21,529 --> 01:43:22,576
What?

1456
01:43:22,655 --> 01:43:25,750
She had to know some innocent
jerk would take the fall.

1457
01:43:26,701 --> 01:43:28,078
Oh, my God, Zack.

1458
01:43:29,537 --> 01:43:30,629
That's it.

1459
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:34,125
That's why!
To prove it happens!

1460
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:37,007
To have absolute proof that the
system convicts innocents.

1461
01:43:37,086 --> 01:43:38,133
Get out of here!

1462
01:43:38,295 --> 01:43:39,296
No.

1463
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:40,723
That's how she thought.

1464
01:43:40,798 --> 01:43:43,551
Think about it! This woman
lived for deathwatch!

1465
01:43:43,634 --> 01:43:46,729
If she's gonna die anyway,
why not die for it?

1466
01:43:46,804 --> 01:43:48,647
That's why the tripod was here.

1467
01:43:48,764 --> 01:43:50,562
To record proof.
Undeniable proof!

1468
01:43:50,641 --> 01:43:52,234
That's why we got the video!

1469
01:43:52,309 --> 01:43:53,982
A dead woman put
the tape in your room?

1470
01:43:54,061 --> 01:43:56,484
No, of course not.
I mean, she needed help.

1471
01:43:56,564 --> 01:43:59,238
Someone to keep it, release it.

1472
01:43:59,316 --> 01:44:02,991
Someone dedicated to the cause.
Someone she could trust.

1473
01:44:47,072 --> 01:44:49,575
What a dump.
The guy's a freak.

1474
01:45:10,971 --> 01:45:12,348
Dusty's a bullhorner.

1475
01:45:12,431 --> 01:45:14,809
A zealot who's OD'd
on too many good causes.

1476
01:45:14,892 --> 01:45:17,486
You know, the original plan
was probably for Dusty

1477
01:45:17,561 --> 01:45:20,155
to release the tape
after Gale's conviction.

1478
01:45:20,231 --> 01:45:22,199
You know, after a year or so.

1479
01:45:22,274 --> 01:45:25,619
It'd force him to dry out,
give him back his dignity.

1480
01:45:25,694 --> 01:45:28,914
So Dusty Wright is sitting
on this tape, waiting.

1481
01:45:29,448 --> 01:45:31,997
And he's the only
one who knows about it.

1482
01:45:32,076 --> 01:45:35,000
So Dusty starts to think
that an erroneous execution

1483
01:45:35,079 --> 01:45:37,832
is a lot more politically
useful than a last-minute save.

1484
01:45:37,915 --> 01:45:41,089
Because a last-minute save would
only prove the system works.

1485
01:45:41,168 --> 01:45:43,842
Almost-martyrs don't count.

1486
01:45:43,921 --> 01:45:48,142
Dusty's thinking, "What's one
murder if it stops thousands?"

1487
01:45:49,301 --> 01:45:52,555
So, he'll release the whole
tape only after the execution.

1488
01:45:56,141 --> 01:45:58,894
Which means he must have
the original somewhere.

1489
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:00,896
What time is it?

1490
01:46:01,021 --> 01:46:02,147
It's 4:50.

1491
01:46:02,231 --> 01:46:03,608
Bitsey, Jesus.

1492
01:46:31,051 --> 01:46:33,349
I want to talk about your tape.

1493
01:46:33,429 --> 01:46:36,683
No, meet me down the hill at
the gas station in 15 minutes.

1494
01:46:39,977 --> 01:46:41,604
So, don't move from the phone.

1495
01:46:41,687 --> 01:46:44,281
Call the second you see his pickup.
Let it ring once.

1496
01:46:44,356 --> 01:46:45,403
Then get into the woods.

1497
01:46:45,482 --> 01:46:46,449
I know. Go.

1498
01:46:46,525 --> 01:46:48,323
Into the woods, Zack.
Go!

1499
01:46:50,654 --> 01:46:51,655
Oh, shit.

1500
01:47:12,092 --> 01:47:15,266
<i>Details of Gale's last meal

01:47:31,612 --> 01:47:32,613
<i>Fresh strawberries.</i>

<i>Puts you to sleep...</i>
Reddi-wip whipped cream.

<i>pancuronium bromide...</i>

<i>Potassium chloride

Chocolate shavings,
extra chocolate.

1515
01:47:45,668 --> 01:47:47,591
<i>and chocolate shavings.</i>

1516

Please, Bitsey, come on!

1531
01:53:09,825 --> 01:53:11,202
Call everyone!

1532

The Governor, the warden, New York,
the Supreme Court death clerk!

1533

How far is it?
You've got eight minutes,

01:53:16,748 --> 01:53:18,625
maybe more.
Okay, we'll make it.

1535

You can do it.
Go!

1536
01:53:32,472 --> 01:53:33,724
Shower. Go.

01:58:47,329 --> 01:58:48,626
<i>The footage appears to show...</i>

1588
01:58:48,705 --> 01:58:50,924
<i>Constance
Harraway committing suicide.</i>

1589
01:58:50,999 --> 01:58:52,592
<i>Bloom reports that she received</i>

1590
01:58:52,709 --> 01:58:54,302
<i>the tape Friday
morning in a motel</i>

1591
01:58:54,377 --> 01:58:56,345
<i>in Huntsville,
where she was staying</i>

1592
01:58:56,421 --> 01:58:58,423
<i>while conducting
Gale's last interview.</i>

1593
01:59:03,845 --> 01:59:06,064
<i>The tape has been
in the possession of</i>

1594
01:59:06,139 --> 01:59:09,643
<i>former Death Watch employee,
Dustin Emil Wright.</i>

1595
01:59:11,728 --> 01:59:14,607
<i>As you can see, police have
been in and out of his cabin</i>

1596
01:59:14,689 --> 01:59:17,442
<i>all morning, looking for
clues to his whereabouts.</i>

1597
01:59:17,525 --> 01:59:19,653
<i>Ever since his
1994 conviction...</i>

1598
01:59:19,736 --> 01:59:21,955
<i>been on death row,
awaiting execution.</i>

1599
01:59:22,030 --> 01:59:24,328
<i>Blacks and Latinos are
five times more likely</i>

1600
01:59:24,407 --> 01:59:26,284
<i>to face the death
penalty than whites.</i>

1601
01:59:26,368 --> 01:59:28,496
<i>A fanatic in the movement
to stop the death...</i>

1602
01:59:28,578 --> 01:59:29,579
It's all there?

1603
01:59:29,663 --> 01:59:31,791
<i>actively seeking
a Dustin Wright.</i>

1604
01:59:33,583 --> 01:59:35,961
<i>It appears Wright
withheld a tape to make...</i>

1605
01:59:36,044 --> 01:59:38,012
<i>a political point
about the potential</i>

1606
01:59:38,088 --> 01:59:40,136
<i>for error in capital
punishment cases.</i>

1607
01:59:40,215 --> 01:59:41,762
Passport and ticket as well.

1608
01:59:43,510 --> 01:59:45,604
<i>Dana, what everyone
here is asking...</i>

1609
01:59:45,679 --> 01:59:48,182
<i>It's a terrible tragedy.
There 'II be an investigation.</i>

1610
01:59:48,264 --> 01:59:49,937
<i>I assure you that
this man, Dusty,</i>

1611
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:51,727
<i>will be caught
and shown justice.</i>

1612
01:59:51,810 --> 01:59:53,890
<i>Justice, for Christ's sakes!
Ever since this world...</i>

1613
01:59:53,937 --> 01:59:55,689
<i>The people of
Texas are not deterred.</i>

1614
01:59:55,772 --> 01:59:57,570
<i>We're behind the death penalty</i>

1615
01:59:57,649 --> 02:00:00,493
<i>because it works. The system
cannot be blamed for the acts</i>

1616
02:00:00,568 --> 02:00:02,696
<i>of a deranged individual
with an ax to grind.</i>

1617
02:00:02,779 --> 02:00:05,373
<i>People have been put to death
in the name of justice.</i>

1618
02:00:05,448 --> 02:00:08,497
<i>Let's not throw the baby
out with the bathwater, folks.</i>

1619
02:00:13,498 --> 02:00:16,468
<i>Of course, the ultimate
irony is that David Gale...</i>

1620
02:00:16,543 --> 02:00:18,716
a man who became
an unwitting martyr...

1621
02:00:18,795 --> 02:00:20,923
<i>may achieve in
death what he worked for...</i>

1622
02:00:21,005 --> 02:00:23,133
<i>but could not
accomplish in life.</i>

1623
02:00:23,216 --> 02:00:26,060
<i>This is A.J. Roberts
reporting from Bastrop, Texas.</i>

1624
02:01:27,489 --> 02:01:29,082
This just came.

1625
02:02:52,198 --> 02:02:54,451
"Key to your freedom"?

1626
02:02:54,534 --> 02:02:55,535
What?

1627
02:03:52,342 --> 02:03:53,719
<i>It's over.</i>
