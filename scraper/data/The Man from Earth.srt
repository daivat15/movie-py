1
00:00:43,451 --> 00:00:45,748
Hey, buddy.

2
00:00:45,783 --> 00:00:47,783
You don't waste time, do you?

3
00:00:47,818 --> 00:00:49,482
I try not to.

4
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:50,817
Well, you need help?

5
00:00:50,852 --> 00:00:51,917
Sure.

6
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:57,717
Would you like to tell us

7
00:00:57,752 --> 00:00:59,783
what the hell that was all about?

8
00:00:59,818 --> 00:01:01,115
I don't like good-byes.

9
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,983
Kind of the point of
a good-bye party, John.

10
00:01:04,018 --> 00:01:06,534
Went to a certain amount
of trouble, you know?

11
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:09,015
Could've at least stayed
a few minutes, huh?

12
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,950
Eaten some of the food
we so feverishly prepared?

13
00:01:12,985 --> 00:01:14,549
I apologize, Harry.

14
00:01:14,584 --> 00:01:16,149
But why are you moving so quickly?

15
00:01:16,184 --> 00:01:18,284
You only resigned a couple of days ago.

16
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,384
You got the history chair at Stanford.

17
00:01:20,419 --> 00:01:21,482
I wish.

18
00:01:21,517 --> 00:01:23,683
Well, taquitos, chicken wings,

19
00:01:23,718 --> 00:01:25,567
Roastie-Toasties and beer.

20
00:01:25,602 --> 00:01:27,382
If we'd had more time,

21
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:29,451
we'd have done something
a little more grandiose.

22
00:01:29,486 --> 00:01:31,217
Candlelight dinner at McDonald's.

23
00:01:31,252 --> 00:01:32,782
Strippers.

24
00:01:32,817 --> 00:01:34,618
Taquitos are fine.

25
00:01:34,653 --> 00:01:36,549
A'right.

26
00:01:36,584 --> 00:01:38,349
Art's gonna be along, too.

27
00:01:38,384 --> 00:01:40,150
He's, uh, talking to a student. Pfft.

28
00:01:40,185 --> 00:01:42,049
Is George taking over for you?

29
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:44,750
- George or Trimbell.
- Has the dean made up his mind?

30
00:01:44,785 --> 00:01:45,850
He hasn't called.

31
00:01:45,885 --> 00:01:46,882
My god!

32
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:48,316
Wh-What is this?

33
00:01:48,351 --> 00:01:49,616
It looks like a Van Gogh,

34
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,101
But I've never seen it before.

35
00:01:51,136 --> 00:01:52,516
Is that an original, John?

36
00:01:52,551 --> 00:01:54,883
No, it's just a gift someone gave me.

37
00:01:54,918 --> 00:01:56,867
Still, it's a superb copy.

38
00:01:56,902 --> 00:01:58,826
Contemporaneous, I think,

39
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:00,750
May I take a closer look?

40
00:02:00,785 --> 00:02:01,883
Please, yeah.

41
00:02:04,084 --> 00:02:06,684
Yeah, it's the same
stretcher as Van Gogh used.

42
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,284
Yeah, there's writing
on the back in French.

43
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:11,718
Oh, "to my friend Jacques Borne."

44
00:02:11,753 --> 00:02:12,949
Wonder who that was?

45
00:02:12,984 --> 00:02:14,449
Someone he knew, I guess.

46
00:02:14,484 --> 00:02:16,149
Brilliant deduction, sherlock.

47
00:02:16,184 --> 00:02:19,084
Surely you'll have this
looked at, appraised?

48
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:21,082
Well, maybe sometime,

49
00:02:21,117 --> 00:02:24,351
but I wouldn't really want money for it.

50
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,049
That does it.

51
00:02:28,084 --> 00:02:29,915
Put that stuff in the kitchen.

52
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,451
No, I'm gonna put it
in the bathroom, John.

53
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,718
Gas is off, electricity's on.

54
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:38,949
Get comfortable while you can.

55
00:02:38,984 --> 00:02:41,484
The furniture's going this afternoon.

56
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,984
It's been years since I sat on a floor.

57
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:45,934
Heh. I can't remember her name.

58
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:47,576
Eh, it's good for the back.

59
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:49,464
Can we do yoga exercises?

60
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:51,317
Tantric yoga, we can.

61
00:02:52,684 --> 00:02:55,284
So you're leaving
good old "we teach you."

62
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:58,351
Rather suddenly, you must admit.

63
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,035
Truth time, John.

64
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,684
Is there a problem?

65
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,049
No.

66
00:03:03,084 --> 00:03:05,267
Oh, come on, you know we wanna help.

67
00:03:05,302 --> 00:03:07,451
That's appreciated, but really -

68
00:03:07,486 --> 00:03:09,485
There's no problem.

69
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,102
Well, now I am curious.

70
00:03:11,137 --> 00:03:12,410
Where are you going?

71
00:03:12,445 --> 00:03:13,649
Givin' up tenure...

72
00:03:13,684 --> 00:03:15,649
A decade of professorship,

73
00:03:15,684 --> 00:03:18,082
in line to chair the department,

74
00:03:18,117 --> 00:03:20,950
and you don't know where you're going?

75
00:03:20,985 --> 00:03:22,416
Call it cabin fever.

76
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:24,950
After a while, I get itchy feet.

77
00:03:24,985 --> 00:03:26,249
I've done this before.

78
00:03:26,284 --> 00:03:29,351
No, no, no, you're too young
to have done this before.

79
00:03:29,386 --> 00:03:31,651
And he hasn't aged a day in ten years.

80
00:03:31,686 --> 00:03:33,182
Every woman on the faculty

81
00:03:33,217 --> 00:03:35,783
would give anything to have that secret.

82
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:37,384
Is that what they're after, Edith?

83
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:39,050
Oh, stop, Harry.

84
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:43,451
Wow, can you pull this?

85
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:46,467
What the hell?

86
00:03:46,502 --> 00:03:47,793
What do you hunt?

87
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,039
Deer, mostly.

88
00:03:49,074 --> 00:03:50,216
Around big bear.

89
00:03:50,251 --> 00:03:51,616
With a bow and arrow?

90
00:03:51,651 --> 00:03:53,382
Most people can't bag a deer

91
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:55,417
with a rifle and a telescopic sight.

92
00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:57,035
Though, good eatin'.

93
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,583
The best wild game.

94
00:03:58,618 --> 00:04:00,184
Lives naturally, eats naturally.

95
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:01,750
Well, it's beautiful.

96
00:04:04,885 --> 00:04:06,584
Art.

97
00:04:08,284 --> 00:04:09,915
Ah.

98
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,217
So, can I get an "a" for awesome?

99
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:14,268
Oh, my gosh.

100
00:04:15,561 --> 00:04:17,039
That was fun.

101
00:04:17,074 --> 00:04:18,482
Hey, John.

102
00:04:18,517 --> 00:04:20,950
You know Linda.
You had her last semester.

103
00:04:20,985 --> 00:04:22,316
Hi. Hey.

104
00:04:22,351 --> 00:04:24,250
She's one of my victims now.
I'm taking her home.

105
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:26,150
She wanted to come by
and say hello good-bye.

106
00:04:26,185 --> 00:04:27,617
Is Art as tough as I hear?

107
00:04:27,652 --> 00:04:29,015
Oh, archaeology's tough.

108
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,050
Dr. Jenkins is a fine teacher.

109
00:04:31,085 --> 00:04:33,050
Oh, that's very politic.

110
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:34,616
It's very true. Uh-huh.

111
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:37,115
Something for you to
read on the road, pal.

112
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,050
<i>"Shadows of the cave:
parallels to early man."</i>

113
00:04:40,085 --> 00:04:41,484
M. Jenkins.

114
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,701
Publish or perish.

115
00:04:42,736 --> 00:04:43,848
I'd rather read

116
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:44,950
than write another one.

117
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,883
Thank you.

118
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:48,149
Hi.

119
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:50,434
Oh, everybody, this is Linda.

120
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:52,684
Linda, this is everybody.

121
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:54,251
Linda. Hi.

122
00:04:54,286 --> 00:04:56,516
So.

123
00:04:56,551 --> 00:04:59,050
Where you going, John,
like we give a damn?

124
00:04:59,085 --> 00:05:00,251
We've already covered that.

125
00:05:00,286 --> 00:05:02,715
John's got itchy feet.

126
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,050
There are over-the-counter
remedies for that, John.

127
00:05:07,984 --> 00:05:09,317
So there is a problem.

128
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:11,115
No.

129
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,451
I just like to move on now and then.

130
00:05:13,486 --> 00:05:14,817
It's a personal thing.

131
00:05:16,284 --> 00:05:18,284
Well, not to pry.

132
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,715
I'm sorry I don't
have more to offer you.

133
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,284
Got conversation, some
seats for your behinds,

134
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,351
And, uh...

135
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:38,618
Is he ducking out on us again?

136
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,715
...I do have this.

137
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,382
Oh ho ho! Johnny Walker green!

138
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:49,184
Didn't even
know they made it in green.

139
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:50,649
What do they pay you?

140
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,616
Nothing is too good for my friends.

141
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:55,618
But I'm sorry -
we are down to plastic cups now.

142
00:05:55,653 --> 00:05:57,618
That's a sacrilege I'll tolerate.

143
00:05:57,653 --> 00:05:59,301
I will do the honors.

144
00:05:59,336 --> 00:06:00,950
Oh, come to papa.

145
00:06:02,551 --> 00:06:04,050
Ooh! Here, cups, cups.

146
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:05,117
There we go.

147
00:06:05,152 --> 00:06:06,251
Step on in here.

148
00:06:06,286 --> 00:06:07,316
There ya go...

149
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:09,817
One for the birthday boy
- Excuse me. Art?

150
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:10,949
No, not for me.

151
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:12,349
Oh, no, I don't drink.

152
00:06:12,384 --> 00:06:14,417
We're not
gonna card you, darling.

153
00:06:14,452 --> 00:06:16,451
All right, here, join
the circle at least.

154
00:06:16,486 --> 00:06:21,150
Well, to long life and good fortune

155
00:06:21,185 --> 00:06:22,715
To our esteemed friend

156
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,667
and colleague, John Oldman.

157
00:06:24,702 --> 00:06:26,584
May he find undeserved bliss

158
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:27,817
wherever he goes.

159
00:06:27,852 --> 00:06:28,815
Hear, hear.

160
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,734
<i>Skol. Na zdorovye.</i>

161
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:32,618
One off the top, John.

162
00:06:37,718 --> 00:06:39,451
Mm! Oh, that's good.

163
00:06:39,486 --> 00:06:40,651
Excuse me.

164
00:06:42,883 --> 00:06:46,251
John, we're all sorry to see you go.

165
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:47,351
Truly.

166
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,949
Okay. Now we're done with that,

167
00:06:51,984 --> 00:06:53,984
what do we do for the
rest of the afternoon?

168
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:55,801
Anyone got a good topic?

169
00:06:55,836 --> 00:06:57,584
Like this, maybe? Heh.

170
00:06:57,619 --> 00:06:58,616
What is that?

171
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:01,384
It's a burin off a parrot beak.

172
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:03,234
Inclined chisel point...

173
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:05,293
Probably early Magdalenian.

174
00:07:05,328 --> 00:07:07,317
May I see that?
Sure.

175
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:15,150
Yes indeed, that's what it is.

176
00:07:16,384 --> 00:07:17,583
What's a burin?

177
00:07:17,618 --> 00:07:19,249
A burin is a flint tool

178
00:07:19,284 --> 00:07:21,883
for grooving wood and
bone, antlers especially,

179
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:24,382
to make spear and harpoon points.

180
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:26,417
Magdalenians weren't
noted for flint work,

181
00:07:26,452 --> 00:07:28,184
so this is a very nice specimen.

182
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:30,684
Okay, what's a Magdalenian?

183
00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:32,115
A later Cro-Magnon,

184
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,449
without gettin' technical.

185
00:07:33,484 --> 00:07:36,618
It's the final culture
of the upper Paleolithic.

186
00:07:36,653 --> 00:07:38,435
If stones could speak, eh, Art?

187
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,182
So where'd you get that, John?

188
00:07:40,217 --> 00:07:42,783
Believe it or not, from a thrift shop.
A quarter.

189
00:07:42,818 --> 00:07:44,349
You lucky dog!

190
00:07:44,384 --> 00:07:46,651
I gotta go digging
for this kind of stuff.

191
00:07:46,686 --> 00:07:47,883
Can I, uh...?

192
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:48,917
Yeah.

193
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:53,451
Huh.

194
00:07:58,484 --> 00:08:00,182
Maybe...

195
00:08:00,217 --> 00:08:01,782
I'm glad you did this.

196
00:08:01,817 --> 00:08:04,618
Did what? You mean come over?

197
00:08:04,653 --> 00:08:06,349
Maybe?

198
00:08:06,384 --> 00:08:07,667
Definitely.

199
00:08:07,702 --> 00:08:09,026
Gee, thanks.

200
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:10,351
Well, so are we.

201
00:08:10,386 --> 00:08:11,782
So are we.

202
00:08:11,817 --> 00:08:13,950
We couldn't let you just run off.

203
00:08:13,985 --> 00:08:15,150
Thanks.

204
00:08:17,184 --> 00:08:18,949
John, what is up, huh?

205
00:08:18,984 --> 00:08:20,484
<i>Are you on America's most wanted?</i>

206
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,649
We won't turn you in.

207
00:08:21,684 --> 00:08:23,050
Yeah, come on, out with it.

208
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,050
You're among friends.

209
00:08:24,085 --> 00:08:25,317
Snoopy friends.

210
00:08:25,352 --> 00:08:26,349
Forget it.

211
00:08:26,384 --> 00:08:28,015
You are creating the mystery here.

212
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,351
Obviously, you have something
you'd like to say. Say it!

213
00:08:31,984 --> 00:08:33,618
Well, maybe I...

214
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,984
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

215
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:37,050
Harry, stop.

216
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:41,416
There is something I'm
tempted to tell you, I think.

217
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:45,050
I've never done this before,
and I wonder how it'll pan out.

218
00:08:48,217 --> 00:08:50,517
I wonder if I could ask
you a silly question.

219
00:08:50,552 --> 00:08:51,516
John, we're teachers.

220
00:08:51,551 --> 00:08:53,484
We answer silly questions all the time.

221
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,583
Hey!

222
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:58,284
What if a man from the upper Paleolithic

223
00:08:58,319 --> 00:09:00,118
survived until the present day?

224
00:09:00,153 --> 00:09:01,917
What do you mean, survived?

225
00:09:01,952 --> 00:09:03,249
Never died?

226
00:09:03,284 --> 00:09:05,351
Yes. What would he be like?

227
00:09:05,386 --> 00:09:06,882
Well, I know some guys.

228
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:08,734
You ever been to the Ozarks?

229
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:10,516
It's an interesting idea.

230
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:13,050
What, are you working on
a science fiction story?

231
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,317
Say I am. What would he be like?

232
00:09:15,352 --> 00:09:16,634
Pretty tired.

233
00:09:18,528 --> 00:09:20,282
Well, seriously,

234
00:09:20,317 --> 00:09:22,484
As Art's book title suggests,

235
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,651
he might be like any of us.

236
00:09:24,686 --> 00:09:25,949
Dan. A caveman?

237
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:27,801
Well, there's no anatomical difference

238
00:09:27,836 --> 00:09:29,583
between, say, a Cro-Magnon and us.

239
00:09:29,618 --> 00:09:32,017
Except that as a rule,
we've grown taller.

240
00:09:32,052 --> 00:09:34,382
What's the selective
advantage of height?

241
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:37,150
Better to see predators
in tall grass, my dear.

242
00:09:37,185 --> 00:09:39,449
Actually, tall and skinny

243
00:09:39,484 --> 00:09:42,351
radiates heat more
effectively in warmer climates.

244
00:09:42,386 --> 00:09:43,649
And as for neanderthals,

245
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:45,384
I mean, we've all seen apish people.

246
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:46,618
That strain's still with us.

247
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,750
But he'd be a caveman.

248
00:09:48,785 --> 00:09:49,782
No, he wouldn't.

249
00:09:49,817 --> 00:09:50,815
John's hypothetical man

250
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,618
would have lived
through 140 centuries...

251
00:09:52,653 --> 00:09:54,015
Yeah, roughly.

252
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,433
...and changed with every one of them.

253
00:09:56,468 --> 00:09:58,782
I mean, assuming normal intelligence.

254
00:09:58,817 --> 00:10:01,284
Well, we think men of
the upper Paleolithic

255
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:03,151
were as intelligent as we are.

256
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,949
They just didn't know as much.

257
00:10:04,984 --> 00:10:07,950
John's man would have
learned as the race learned.

258
00:10:07,985 --> 00:10:11,118
In fact, if he had an inquiring mind,

259
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:14,216
his knowledge might be astonishing.

260
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:16,517
If you do write that,
let me have a look at it.

261
00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:18,783
I'm sure you'll make some
anthropological boners.

262
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:19,882
It's a deal.

263
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:21,767
What would keep him alive?

264
00:10:21,802 --> 00:10:23,618
What does the biologist say?

265
00:10:23,653 --> 00:10:25,282
Cigarettes.

266
00:10:25,317 --> 00:10:27,115
And ice cream.

267
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,249
All right, all right, I'll play.

268
00:10:29,284 --> 00:10:32,984
All right, um, in science fiction terms,

269
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:34,651
I would say...

270
00:10:36,184 --> 00:10:39,984
Perfect regeneration
of the body's cells,

271
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:42,115
especially in the vital organs.

272
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,017
Actually, the human
body appears designed

273
00:10:44,052 --> 00:10:46,115
to live about 190 years.

274
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:49,984
Most of us just die of slow poisoning.

275
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:51,516
Maybe he did something right,

276
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:54,850
something everybody else
in history had done wrong.

277
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:56,282
What, like eat the food,

278
00:10:56,317 --> 00:10:58,317
drink the water, and breathe the air?

279
00:10:58,352 --> 00:11:00,301
Prior to modern times,

280
00:11:00,336 --> 00:11:02,216
those were pristine.

281
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:06,718
We've extended our lifespan
in a world that's, uh...

282
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:08,616
not fit to live in.

283
00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:10,115
You know, it could happen.

284
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,451
The pancreas turns over
cells every 24 hours,

285
00:11:12,486 --> 00:11:14,085
the stomach lining in three days,

286
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,684
the entire body in seven years,

287
00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:17,249
but the process falters.

288
00:11:17,284 --> 00:11:20,084
Waste accumulates, eventually
proves fatal to function.

289
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:22,750
Now if a quirk in his immune system

290
00:11:22,785 --> 00:11:24,516
led to perfect detox,

291
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,517
perfect renewal, then yeah.

292
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,782
He could duck decay.

293
00:11:28,817 --> 00:11:31,050
Mm, that's a secret
we'd all love to have.

294
00:11:31,085 --> 00:11:34,017
Would you really want to do that?

295
00:11:34,052 --> 00:11:35,949
Live 14,000 years?

296
00:11:35,984 --> 00:11:38,783
Well, if I could stay
healthy and I didn't age,

297
00:11:38,818 --> 00:11:39,949
I mean, why not?

298
00:11:39,984 --> 00:11:42,150
Yeah. What a chance to learn.

299
00:11:42,185 --> 00:11:45,015
Is anyone hungry?

300
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,917
You know, the more I think
about it, yeah, it's possible.

301
00:11:47,952 --> 00:11:49,516
Anything is possible, right?

302
00:11:49,551 --> 00:11:52,817
After all, one century's magic,
another century's science.

303
00:11:52,852 --> 00:11:54,984
They thought Columbus
was a nut job, right?

304
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:56,082
Pasteur, Copernicus?

305
00:11:56,117 --> 00:11:57,750
Aristarchus long before that.

306
00:11:57,785 --> 00:11:58,882
Right.

307
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:01,234
I had a chance to sail with Columbus,

308
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:03,643
Only I'm not the adventurous type.

309
00:12:03,678 --> 00:12:06,614
I was pretty sure the Earth was round,

310
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:09,366
but at that point, I still thought

311
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:12,084
he might fall off an edge someplace...

312
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,417
Look around, John.

313
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,848
We just did.

314
00:12:25,883 --> 00:12:28,217
I suppose there's a
joke in there somewhere,

315
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:29,516
but I don't get it.

316
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:31,417
There's nothing to get.

317
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:33,249
What are we talking about?

318
00:12:33,284 --> 00:12:35,184
We were just talking about a caveman

319
00:12:35,219 --> 00:12:37,584
who survives until the present time.

320
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:39,950
As you said, what a chance to learn,

321
00:12:39,985 --> 00:12:41,384
once I learned to learn.

322
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:45,618
Did you start the whiskey
before we got here?

323
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:50,584
Pretend it's science fiction.

324
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:52,382
Figure it out.

325
00:12:52,417 --> 00:12:56,917
Okay, a-
- Very old Cro-Magnon

326
00:12:56,952 --> 00:12:58,484
living until the present.

327
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:02,082
Oh!

328
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,349
What?

329
00:13:08,384 --> 00:13:11,284
John just confided that
he's 14,000 years old.

330
00:13:11,319 --> 00:13:14,917
Oh, John, you don't look a day over 900.

331
00:13:14,952 --> 00:13:16,182
Okay, okay.

332
00:13:16,217 --> 00:13:17,950
All right, Spock, I'll
play your little game.

333
00:13:17,985 --> 00:13:20,668
What do you want? What's the punch line?

334
00:13:20,703 --> 00:13:23,351
Every ten years or so, when people start

335
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,117
to notice I don't age, I move on.

336
00:13:27,718 --> 00:13:30,134
That's very good,
that's very quick, John.

337
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:32,551
I wanna read that
story when you're done.

338
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:34,082
You want more?

339
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:35,984
By all means. This is great.

340
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:37,017
All right, now...

341
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:40,718
So you think that you are a...

342
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:41,815
A, uh, Cro-Magnon.

343
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,417
Well, I didn't learn it in school.

344
00:13:43,452 --> 00:13:45,149
That's my best guess,

345
00:13:45,184 --> 00:13:49,651
based on archaeological data,
maps, anthropological research.

346
00:13:49,686 --> 00:13:51,049
Since Mesopotamia,

347
00:13:51,084 --> 00:13:54,250
I've got the last...
4,000 years straight.

348
00:13:54,285 --> 00:13:57,417
You're ahead of most
people, so please, go on.

349
00:13:57,452 --> 00:13:59,017
Well, you know the background stuff,

350
00:13:59,052 --> 00:14:00,482
so I'll make it brief.

351
00:14:00,517 --> 00:14:02,984
In what I call my first lifetime,

352
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:04,718
I aged to about 35...

353
00:14:04,753 --> 00:14:06,382
what you see.

354
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:08,551
I ended up leading my group.

355
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:10,416
They saw me as magical.

356
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:13,482
I didn't even have to fight for it.

357
00:14:13,517 --> 00:14:16,384
Then fear came, and they chased me away.

358
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:17,915
They thought that I was

359
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,284
stealing their lives away to stay young.

360
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,618
The prehistoric origin
of the vampire myth.

361
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:23,583
That is good!

362
00:14:23,618 --> 00:14:24,649
First thousand years,

363
00:14:24,684 --> 00:14:26,782
I didn't know up from sideways.

364
00:14:26,817 --> 00:14:29,251
How do you know the
first thousand years?

365
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:30,818
An informed guess, based on what

366
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:32,316
I've learned in my memories.

367
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:34,417
Most people can scarcely
remember their childhood,

368
00:14:34,452 --> 00:14:36,517
but you have memories of that time?

369
00:14:36,552 --> 00:14:38,115
Like yours, selective.

370
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:41,517
You know, the high points,
the low points, traumas.

371
00:14:41,552 --> 00:14:43,282
They stick in the mind forever.

372
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:47,217
Put down at 3 or 35,
you still feel a twinge.

373
00:14:49,684 --> 00:14:51,015
Go on.

374
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:54,100
I kept getting chased
because I wouldn't die,

375
00:14:54,135 --> 00:14:57,526
so I got the hang of
joining new groups I found.

376
00:14:57,561 --> 00:15:00,917
I also got the idea of
periodically moving on.

377
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:03,549
We were semi-nomadic, of course,

378
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:06,551
following the weather
and the game we hunted.

379
00:15:06,586 --> 00:15:08,549
The first 2,000 years were cold.

380
00:15:08,584 --> 00:15:11,184
We learned it was warmer
at lower elevations.

381
00:15:11,219 --> 00:15:13,818
Late glacial period, I assume.

382
00:15:13,853 --> 00:15:16,417
What was the terrain like?

383
00:15:16,452 --> 00:15:19,583
Mountainous.

384
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,484
Vast plains to the west.

385
00:15:22,684 --> 00:15:25,618
West - something you learned in school.

386
00:15:25,653 --> 00:15:28,249
Towards the setting sun.

387
00:15:28,284 --> 00:15:30,617
I suspect I saw the British isles

388
00:15:30,652 --> 00:15:32,950
from what is now the French coast.

389
00:15:32,985 --> 00:15:34,616
Huge mountains...

390
00:15:34,651 --> 00:15:37,384
on the other side of
an enormous deep valley

391
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:39,335
that was shadowed by the setting sun.

392
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,216
This is before they were separated

393
00:15:41,251 --> 00:15:43,883
from the continent by rising
seas, as glaciers melted.

394
00:15:45,017 --> 00:15:46,482
That happened?

395
00:15:46,517 --> 00:15:48,651
Yes, the end of the Pleistocene.

396
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:50,718
So far, what he says fits.

397
00:15:50,753 --> 00:15:52,785
Oh, yeah, into any textbook.

398
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,782
And that's where I found it.

399
00:15:54,817 --> 00:15:56,684
How can I have knowledgeable recall

400
00:15:56,719 --> 00:15:58,551
if I didn't have knowledge?

401
00:15:58,586 --> 00:16:00,583
It's all retrospective.

402
00:16:00,618 --> 00:16:03,084
All I can do is
integrate my recollections

403
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:04,882
with modern findings.

404
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:07,584
Caveman, you gonna hit me
over the head with a club

405
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:09,268
and drag me into the bedroom?

406
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:10,917
You'd be more fun conscious.

407
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:11,882
Oh, John.

408
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:13,182
Let me get this straight.

409
00:16:13,217 --> 00:16:15,067
We're not talking about reincarnation.

410
00:16:15,102 --> 00:16:16,917
You're not saying that you remember

411
00:16:16,952 --> 00:16:18,351
whatever the hell it would be,

412
00:16:18,386 --> 00:16:19,715
200 separate lifetimes, dying

413
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,150
and being born again and yada yada?

414
00:16:22,185 --> 00:16:23,651
One lifetime.

415
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,184
Some lifetime.

416
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:27,516
Wow.

417
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:30,017
Maybe there is something
to this reincarnation thing.

418
00:16:30,052 --> 00:16:31,316
You're supposed to come back

419
00:16:31,351 --> 00:16:32,951
again and again, learn and learn,

420
00:16:32,986 --> 00:16:34,551
and somehow, John, you just managed

421
00:16:34,586 --> 00:16:36,117
to bypass all the other bodies.

422
00:16:36,152 --> 00:16:38,417
Well, what's the point?

423
00:16:41,451 --> 00:16:43,282
What about oceans?

424
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:45,616
Didn't see them till much later.

425
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:47,984
So how would you know
an ocean from a lake?

426
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:49,848
Big waves - something else.

427
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,082
I can only surmise in retrospect.

428
00:16:52,117 --> 00:16:54,117
Were you curious about
where it all came from?

429
00:16:55,584 --> 00:16:57,784
We would look up at the sky and wonder.

430
00:16:57,819 --> 00:16:59,984
"There's gotta be
some big guys up there.

431
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,783
What else made all this down here?"

432
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:03,316
At first I thought

433
00:17:03,351 --> 00:17:05,951
there was something wrong with me -

434
00:17:05,986 --> 00:17:08,551
maybe I was a bad guy for not dying.

435
00:17:09,718 --> 00:17:12,950
Then I began to wonder if I was cursed

436
00:17:12,985 --> 00:17:15,249
or perhaps blessed.

437
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,950
Then I thought maybe I had a mission.

438
00:17:18,985 --> 00:17:20,734
Do you still think you do?

439
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:22,484
God works in mysterious ways.

440
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:25,883
I think I just happened.

441
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:34,718
Wow.

442
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:35,817
Hello?

443
00:17:36,883 --> 00:17:38,733
Yes, Ellie?

444
00:17:38,768 --> 00:17:40,584
What's wrong?

445
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:41,734
Sandy?

446
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,850
Coming.

447
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,115
Yeah?

448
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,883
Do we have Ellie's midterm here?

449
00:17:51,317 --> 00:17:52,349
Yeah, sorry.

450
00:17:52,384 --> 00:17:54,850
I picked it up with the periodicals.

451
00:17:54,885 --> 00:17:56,182
Got it.

452
00:17:56,217 --> 00:17:57,917
No, you're worried about your parents?

453
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,351
Don't- Don't worry.

454
00:17:59,386 --> 00:18:00,715
You passed, C+.

455
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,150
Take care of yourself.

456
00:18:03,185 --> 00:18:04,583
Good kid.

457
00:18:04,618 --> 00:18:06,451
What does pre-med need with history?

458
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:07,818
Got it.

459
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,150
Thank you.

460
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:12,616
Sorry, guys.

461
00:18:12,651 --> 00:18:14,349
John, please continue.

462
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,618
Come on, I thought we
were done with that.

463
00:18:16,653 --> 00:18:18,251
No! Let's go on with it.

464
00:18:18,286 --> 00:18:19,649
It's interesting.

465
00:18:19,684 --> 00:18:22,517
Besides, I think he's making
a certain amount of sense.

466
00:18:22,552 --> 00:18:25,117
Like Hegel.
Logic from absurd premises.

467
00:18:25,152 --> 00:18:26,482
That Van Gogh?

468
00:18:26,517 --> 00:18:28,683
He gave it to me.

469
00:18:28,718 --> 00:18:31,417
I was, uh, Jacques Bourne at the time,

470
00:18:31,452 --> 00:18:32,667
A pig farmer.

471
00:18:32,702 --> 00:18:34,009
A pig farmer?

472
00:18:35,317 --> 00:18:37,382
I like to work with my hands.

473
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,517
He would come out to the place, paint.

474
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,618
We talked about capturing nature in art.

475
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,785
Turner, Cezanne, Pissarro.

476
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,752
Oh, the Nolde landscapes.

477
00:18:45,787 --> 00:18:47,649
Not in Van Gogh's time.

478
00:18:47,684 --> 00:18:49,217
He would have loved them, though.

479
00:18:49,252 --> 00:18:50,249
Yes.

480
00:18:50,284 --> 00:18:51,982
Well, I don't understand

481
00:18:52,017 --> 00:18:54,184
why you can't remember
where you're from.

482
00:18:54,219 --> 00:18:55,984
Geography hasn't changed.

483
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:57,683
I learned that in-

484
00:18:57,718 --> 00:18:59,017
professor Hensen's tepid lectures.

485
00:18:59,052 --> 00:19:00,449
But you're right.

486
00:19:00,484 --> 00:19:02,618
Where did you live when
you were five years old?

487
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:03,748
Little Rock.

488
00:19:03,783 --> 00:19:05,783
Your mother, she took you to the market?

489
00:19:05,818 --> 00:19:07,117
Mm-Hmm. What direction was it?

490
00:19:07,152 --> 00:19:08,534
From your house.

491
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:09,917
I don't know.

492
00:19:09,952 --> 00:19:10,882
How far?

493
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:12,782
Um, three blocks.

494
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:14,317
Were there any references

495
00:19:14,352 --> 00:19:15,782
that stuck in your mind?

496
00:19:15,817 --> 00:19:17,284
Well, there was a gas station

497
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:18,882
and a big field.

498
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:21,050
I was told I could never go there alone.

499
00:19:21,085 --> 00:19:22,718
And if you went back there today,

500
00:19:22,753 --> 00:19:24,216
Would it be the same?

501
00:19:24,251 --> 00:19:27,117
No. I'm sure it's all
different and built up.

502
00:19:27,152 --> 00:19:29,984
Thus the saying
"You can't go home again"

503
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:31,284
Because it isn't there anymore.

504
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:33,082
Picture it on my scale-

505
00:19:33,117 --> 00:19:36,417
I migrated through an endless flat space

506
00:19:36,452 --> 00:19:38,848
full of endless new things.

507
00:19:38,883 --> 00:19:43,718
Forests, mountains, tundra, canyons.

508
00:19:43,753 --> 00:19:47,301
My memory sees what I saw then.

509
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:50,626
My eye sees freeways, urban sprawl,

510
00:19:50,661 --> 00:19:53,882
Big Macs under the Eiffel tower.

511
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:56,618
Early on, the world
got bigger and bigger,

512
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,949
and then...

513
00:19:58,984 --> 00:20:00,783
Think what I've had to unlearn.

514
00:20:00,818 --> 00:20:02,649
And now you're moving on.

515
00:20:02,684 --> 00:20:05,384
As you've said, there's
talk of my not aging,

516
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:08,182
And when that happens, I move on.

517
00:20:08,217 --> 00:20:11,783
Well, it might make sense
to set up your next identity,

518
00:20:11,818 --> 00:20:15,084
Your next ten years, and
then just drop into it.

519
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,868
I've done that a few times,

520
00:20:16,903 --> 00:20:18,727
even passed as my own son.

521
00:20:18,762 --> 00:20:20,516
"Oh, you're an engineer, too?

522
00:20:20,551 --> 00:20:23,049
You're Ben's son. He was a good man."

523
00:20:23,084 --> 00:20:25,734
Saves trouble with
credentials and references.

524
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:28,384
On the other hand, I've
been busted a few times.

525
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:31,451
Spent a year in jail, Belgium, 1862

526
00:20:31,486 --> 00:20:33,115
- I won't forget that -

527
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,150
for faking a government application.

528
00:20:35,185 --> 00:20:37,049
When'd you come to America?

529
00:20:37,084 --> 00:20:39,217
1890, right after Van Gogh's death,

530
00:20:39,252 --> 00:20:41,284
With some French immigrants...

531
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,883
Moving on.

532
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:48,718
An answer for every question.

533
00:20:48,753 --> 00:20:50,482
Except one, John.

534
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:51,850
Why're you doing this?

535
00:20:54,384 --> 00:20:56,850
A whim. Maybe not such a good idea.

536
00:20:56,885 --> 00:20:58,416
I...

537
00:20:58,451 --> 00:21:01,551
Wanted to say good-bye to you as me,

538
00:21:01,586 --> 00:21:03,501
not what you thought I was.

539
00:21:03,536 --> 00:21:05,382
Well, since this isn't funny,

540
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:07,850
we think you might have a problem.

541
00:21:07,885 --> 00:21:09,651
A very serious problem.

542
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,748
I've got boxes to move.

543
00:21:12,783 --> 00:21:14,517
I'll give you a hand.

544
00:21:15,718 --> 00:21:20,517
Wouldn't you have
some relic, an artifact

545
00:21:20,552 --> 00:21:22,950
to remind you of your early life?

546
00:21:22,985 --> 00:21:24,451
Like this, maybe?

547
00:21:24,486 --> 00:21:25,850
Thrift shop.

548
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:26,950
Really.

549
00:21:29,251 --> 00:21:31,618
If you lived 100... 1,000 years...

550
00:21:34,184 --> 00:21:35,616
Would you still have this?

551
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:37,617
What would cause you to keep it?

552
00:21:37,652 --> 00:21:39,584
As a memento to your beginnings,

553
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:41,118
even if you didn't have

554
00:21:41,153 --> 00:21:43,185
the concept of beginnings?

555
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,217
It would be gone, lost.

556
00:21:46,351 --> 00:21:47,416
No.

557
00:21:47,451 --> 00:21:49,251
I don't have artifacts.

558
00:21:51,718 --> 00:21:53,117
Keep that.

559
00:21:55,251 --> 00:21:56,484
Interesting.

560
00:21:58,117 --> 00:22:00,250
You could have lied about that.

561
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:02,384
Don't talk about me while I'm gone.

562
00:22:10,417 --> 00:22:12,216
Is he serious?

563
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:15,015
If he is, I'm sorry to say he's...

564
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:17,950
Oh, how could he have
concealed that for ten years?

565
00:22:17,985 --> 00:22:20,084
Least he doesn't appear to be dangerous.

566
00:22:22,783 --> 00:22:23,949
What are you doing?

567
00:22:23,984 --> 00:22:25,984
Checkin' for a hidden mic.

568
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:27,351
<i>Candid camera.</i>

569
00:22:29,184 --> 00:22:31,134
He's fabricating these wild stories.

570
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:33,084
I've never seen him acting like this.

571
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:35,216
Oh, it's crazy.

572
00:22:35,251 --> 00:22:38,684
All right, all right,
as soon as you can, then.

573
00:22:45,251 --> 00:22:46,917
I love you, you know.

574
00:22:48,251 --> 00:22:49,718
I know.

575
00:22:51,517 --> 00:22:54,251
Since my first week at the office.

576
00:22:58,317 --> 00:22:59,282
And?

577
00:22:59,317 --> 00:23:02,649
I care very much about you,

578
00:23:02,684 --> 00:23:05,251
but now you know what
you'd be getting into.

579
00:23:05,286 --> 00:23:07,184
Do you really think you're a caveman?

580
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,783
Do you?

581
00:23:14,817 --> 00:23:16,049
Could you love me,

582
00:23:16,084 --> 00:23:18,484
or don't you believe in that anymore?

583
00:23:19,917 --> 00:23:22,150
I've gotten over it too many times.

584
00:23:23,718 --> 00:23:25,184
Fond of you...

585
00:23:26,517 --> 00:23:28,883
certainly attracted to you.

586
00:23:31,251 --> 00:23:32,217
That's it?

587
00:23:36,317 --> 00:23:37,750
I can work with that.

588
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,500
If what I'm saying is true,

589
00:23:43,535 --> 00:23:46,050
you and any children will age.

590
00:23:46,085 --> 00:23:47,349
I won't.

591
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,316
And one day I'll leave.

592
00:23:49,351 --> 00:23:52,317
You'll go back to your
May-December romances.

593
00:23:52,352 --> 00:23:53,482
The simple fact is

594
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:55,517
that I can't give you forever.

595
00:23:57,517 --> 00:23:58,917
How long's forever?

596
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,850
Who ever really has it?

597
00:24:06,484 --> 00:24:09,434
My parents split up before I was born,

598
00:24:09,469 --> 00:24:12,384
And then my mom's next marriage lasted

599
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:13,850
what, a whole three years?

600
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,783
Then there's death,
illness, acts of god...

601
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,950
No one knows how long they have.

602
00:24:24,718 --> 00:24:26,384
Or how little.

603
00:24:29,883 --> 00:24:31,184
I love you.

604
00:24:33,117 --> 00:24:34,718
Take whatever you can get.

605
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,284
Like ten years?

606
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,733
Ah! Ha ha ha!

607
00:24:48,185 --> 00:24:49,167
Uhn!

608
00:24:49,202 --> 00:24:50,115
Oh.

609
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,182
Why did you do that?

610
00:24:52,217 --> 00:24:54,850
I wanted to see how fast you
were. Check your reflexes.

611
00:24:54,885 --> 00:24:57,017
I don't have eyes in
the back of my head,

612
00:24:57,052 --> 00:24:58,818
I can't hear a flea walking,

613
00:24:58,853 --> 00:25:00,549
I am not in any way superman.

614
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:03,017
Well, I'm a second-degree black belt.

615
00:25:03,052 --> 00:25:04,850
Give it another thousand years.

616
00:25:06,484 --> 00:25:08,517
Well. I got it, I got it, I got it.

617
00:25:10,117 --> 00:25:11,082
Jesus.

618
00:25:11,117 --> 00:25:12,984
Smooth demonstration, Harry.

619
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:15,017
Sit on it, Dan.

620
00:25:16,217 --> 00:25:17,783
I still have questions.

621
00:25:17,818 --> 00:25:19,583
I-I do too, John.

622
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,217
I mean, are we done with prehistory yet?

623
00:25:22,252 --> 00:25:25,134
Remember any of your original language?

624
00:25:25,169 --> 00:25:28,017
A little. One thing
hasn't changed much...

625
00:25:31,718 --> 00:25:33,616
Did you ever do any cave art?

626
00:25:33,651 --> 00:25:35,684
Do you know the rock art at Les Eyzies?

627
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:36,848
Mm-Hmm.

628
00:25:36,883 --> 00:25:39,217
It was the work of a man named...

629
00:25:40,783 --> 00:25:41,815
Giraud.

630
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,500
He did a pretty good job.

631
00:25:43,535 --> 00:25:45,976
He would draw the animals

632
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,331
that we hoped to find to eat.

633
00:25:48,366 --> 00:25:50,441
One day after a fruitless hunt,

634
00:25:50,476 --> 00:25:52,597
our chief stomped his teeth out

635
00:25:52,632 --> 00:25:54,683
because his magic had failed him.

636
00:25:54,718 --> 00:25:57,783
After that, someone had
to chew his food for him.

637
00:25:57,818 --> 00:25:59,618
Finally, he got- I suspect-

638
00:25:59,653 --> 00:26:01,715
an infected jaw,

639
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,417
and he was abandoned.

640
00:26:03,452 --> 00:26:05,216
That's awful.

641
00:26:05,251 --> 00:26:07,067
You have to know what to kill.

642
00:26:07,102 --> 00:26:08,848
Is this why all your students

643
00:26:08,883 --> 00:26:11,217
say your knowledge of history is...

644
00:26:11,252 --> 00:26:12,282
so amazing?

645
00:26:12,317 --> 00:26:14,382
No, that's mostly based on study.

646
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:18,684
Remember, it's one man,
one place at a time,

647
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:20,982
My solitary viewpoint

648
00:26:21,017 --> 00:26:23,718
of a world I knew almost nothing about.

649
00:26:23,753 --> 00:26:24,949
Well, let's talk about

650
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:27,017
what you say you do know about:

651
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,467
Historical times.

652
00:26:28,502 --> 00:26:29,883
Don't encourage him.

653
00:26:29,918 --> 00:26:31,082
Edith.

654
00:26:31,117 --> 00:26:33,950
Next few thousand years, it got warmer.

655
00:26:33,985 --> 00:26:35,349
A few thousand years-

656
00:26:35,384 --> 00:26:37,884
See, now I know you're guessing.

657
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,384
You can't get there from here, Art.

658
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:42,750
Well then, pray, continue.

659
00:26:43,883 --> 00:26:45,750
We hunted reindeer, mammoths,

660
00:26:45,785 --> 00:26:47,748
bison, horses,

661
00:26:47,783 --> 00:26:49,284
The game retreated northward

662
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:50,482
as the climate changed.

663
00:26:50,517 --> 00:26:52,618
You got the idea of growing food

664
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,416
rather than gathering it,

665
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:56,584
raising animals rather
than hunting them.

666
00:26:56,619 --> 00:26:58,217
Am-Am I getting warm, here?

667
00:26:58,252 --> 00:26:59,748
I bet I am.

668
00:26:59,783 --> 00:27:02,251
Lakeside living becomes commonplace,

669
00:27:02,286 --> 00:27:03,883
- Fishing, fowling...
- Come on!

670
00:27:04,984 --> 00:27:07,150
John, this is out of any textbook.

671
00:27:07,185 --> 00:27:08,182
Even yours.

672
00:27:08,217 --> 00:27:11,049
You got most of it right.

673
00:27:11,084 --> 00:27:13,100
Eventually I headed to the east.

674
00:27:13,135 --> 00:27:15,309
I'd grown curious about the world.

675
00:27:15,344 --> 00:27:17,914
I'd gotten the hang of going it alone,

676
00:27:17,949 --> 00:27:20,484
Learning how to fit in when I wanted to.

677
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:22,349
East.

678
00:27:22,384 --> 00:27:24,249
Towards the rising sun?

679
00:27:24,284 --> 00:27:27,050
Yes. I thought it might be warmer there.

680
00:27:28,317 --> 00:27:31,184
That's when I saw an ocean.

681
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:35,182
The Mediterranean, probably.

682
00:27:35,217 --> 00:27:37,550
It was around the
beginning of the bronze age,

683
00:27:37,585 --> 00:27:39,883
So I followed the trade
routes from the east,

684
00:27:39,918 --> 00:27:41,115
Copper, tin,

685
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:44,283
Learning languages as I went.

686
00:27:44,318 --> 00:27:47,382
Everywhere, creation myths,

687
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:50,150
new gods, so many, so different.

688
00:27:50,185 --> 00:27:52,883
I finally realized that it was...

689
00:27:52,918 --> 00:27:55,449
probably all hogwash,

690
00:27:55,484 --> 00:27:58,049
So I was Sumerian for 2,000 years,

691
00:27:58,084 --> 00:28:00,384
Then finally Babylonian under Hammurabi.

692
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:01,915
Great man.

693
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,482
And I sailed as a Phoenician for a time.

694
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:07,718
See, moving on had been
easier as a hunter-gatherer...

695
00:28:09,351 --> 00:28:11,782
Difficult when villages emerged,

696
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:15,251
tougher still in city states
where authority was centralized.

697
00:28:15,286 --> 00:28:17,049
Strangers were suspect.

698
00:28:17,084 --> 00:28:20,750
It seemed as though I
was always moving on.

699
00:28:20,785 --> 00:28:22,748
I learned some new tricks-

700
00:28:22,783 --> 00:28:25,384
even faked my death a couple of times.

701
00:28:27,584 --> 00:28:29,718
I continued east

702
00:28:29,753 --> 00:28:31,516
to India,

703
00:28:31,551 --> 00:28:35,017
luckily at the time of the Buddha.

704
00:28:35,052 --> 00:28:36,217
Luckily.

705
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,684
Most extraordinary man I've ever known.

706
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:42,848
He taught me things

707
00:28:42,883 --> 00:28:45,200
I'd never thought about before.

708
00:28:45,235 --> 00:28:47,517
You studied... with the Buddha?

709
00:28:47,552 --> 00:28:48,984
Until he died.

710
00:28:50,284 --> 00:28:53,251
He knew there was something
different about me.

711
00:28:53,286 --> 00:28:55,701
I never told him.

712
00:28:55,736 --> 00:28:58,082
This is fascinating.

713
00:28:58,117 --> 00:29:00,382
I almost wish it were true.

714
00:29:00,417 --> 00:29:04,150
Yeah, if it was true,
why are you telling us?

715
00:29:04,185 --> 00:29:05,883
I mean, we might leave here today,

716
00:29:05,918 --> 00:29:07,451
Go out there, tell everybody.

717
00:29:07,486 --> 00:29:08,984
It would vanish in disbelief.

718
00:29:10,217 --> 00:29:12,651
A story that goes around the room.

719
00:29:12,686 --> 00:29:14,715
No credibility.

720
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,850
Even if I could make you believe me,

721
00:29:17,885 --> 00:29:19,583
in a month, you wouldn't.

722
00:29:19,618 --> 00:29:22,118
Some of you would call me a psychopath,

723
00:29:22,153 --> 00:29:24,618
Others would be angry
at a pointless joke.

724
00:29:24,653 --> 00:29:26,652
Some of us are angry now.

725
00:29:26,687 --> 00:29:28,616
This-this was a bad idea.

726
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:31,384
Uh, I love you all, and I do not want

727
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:32,751
to put you through anything.

728
00:29:32,786 --> 00:29:34,049
Then why are you doing it?

729
00:29:34,084 --> 00:29:36,384
'Cause I wanted
to say good-bye-

730
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:37,349
As yourself.

731
00:29:37,384 --> 00:29:38,917
I think you've done that,

732
00:29:38,952 --> 00:29:40,017
whoever that self is.

733
00:29:40,052 --> 00:29:41,249
Easy, Edith.

734
00:29:41,284 --> 00:29:42,915
We're just grading his homework.

735
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,750
I see what's going on. You're
playing the good cop, Dan.

736
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:47,082
That's fine. Just enjoy it.

737
00:29:47,117 --> 00:29:49,783
All right, I think this
whole thing is just a crock!

738
00:29:49,818 --> 00:29:51,516
I should leave, but I'm gonna stay.

739
00:29:51,551 --> 00:29:54,251
You know why? 'Cause I wanna
see what this is all about.

740
00:29:54,286 --> 00:29:55,782
So do I. What is this all about?

741
00:29:55,817 --> 00:29:57,917
Let's ask Dr. Freud,
who's just arrived.

742
00:29:57,952 --> 00:29:59,317
Hey, Will! Will!

743
00:30:01,317 --> 00:30:02,251
Art. Hey.

744
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:04,616
John!

745
00:30:04,651 --> 00:30:06,115
I'm glad I caught you.

746
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,083
Someone mentioned
that you were leaving-

747
00:30:08,118 --> 00:30:09,982
Called you, told you that I've lost it.

748
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:12,783
Glad you're here. Things are
going in unexpected directions.

749
00:30:12,818 --> 00:30:14,050
Yes, so I hear.

750
00:30:14,085 --> 00:30:15,316
Hi.

751
00:30:15,351 --> 00:30:16,934
Are you hungry?

752
00:30:16,969 --> 00:30:18,482
Uh, thank you, no.

753
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:20,684
Whiskey? Johnny Walker green.

754
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:22,684
Oh, yes.

755
00:30:26,084 --> 00:30:28,684
You look very familiar,
my dear. Linda Murphy.

756
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:31,284
I'm in your tuesday
psych 1 class, Dr. Gruber.

757
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:33,850
Ah, well, this lesson may be something

758
00:30:33,885 --> 00:30:36,915
I could not have imagined.

759
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:41,282
I regret being so
obvious about this, John,

760
00:30:41,317 --> 00:30:44,584
but these people are all
very concerned for you.

761
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:47,216
Yes, I'm cutting out paper dinosaurs.

762
00:30:47,251 --> 00:30:50,417
I really wish I'd been
here from the beginning.

763
00:30:50,452 --> 00:30:51,449
Me too.

764
00:30:51,484 --> 00:30:53,482
Let me just say something right now.

765
00:30:53,517 --> 00:30:55,850
There's absolutely no
way in the whole world

766
00:30:55,885 --> 00:30:58,616
for John to prove this story to us,

767
00:30:58,651 --> 00:31:01,618
just like there's no way
for us to disprove it.

768
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:03,815
No matter how outrageous we think it is,

769
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:07,117
no matter how highly trained
some of us think we are,

770
00:31:07,152 --> 00:31:09,316
there's absolutely
no way to disprove it.

771
00:31:09,351 --> 00:31:13,817
Our friend is either a
caveman, a liar, or a nut.

772
00:31:13,852 --> 00:31:15,317
So while we're thinking about that,

773
00:31:15,352 --> 00:31:17,984
why don't we just go with it?

774
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:19,449
I mean, hell, who knows,

775
00:31:19,484 --> 00:31:21,500
he might jolt us into believing him,

776
00:31:21,535 --> 00:31:23,517
or we might jolt him back to reality.

777
00:31:23,552 --> 00:31:26,034
Believing? Whose reality?

778
00:31:26,069 --> 00:31:28,517
So... you're a caveman.

779
00:31:28,552 --> 00:31:29,815
Yes. Uh...

780
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:33,282
<i>Uh, I was a Cro-Magnon, I think.</i>

781
00:31:33,317 --> 00:31:36,084
You don't know if
you're a caveman or not?

782
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:37,384
No, I'm sure about that.

783
00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:38,516
A Cro-Magnon, then.

784
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:40,649
When did you first realize this?

785
00:31:40,684 --> 00:31:42,883
When the Cro-Magnon
was first identified,

786
00:31:42,918 --> 00:31:44,984
when anthropology gave them a name,

787
00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:46,482
I had mine.

788
00:31:46,517 --> 00:31:47,915
Well, please continue.

789
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,883
I'm sure you must have more to say.

790
00:31:49,918 --> 00:31:51,817
Would you like me to lie on the couch?

791
00:31:51,852 --> 00:31:54,417
As you wish.

792
00:31:56,284 --> 00:31:58,882
As a physician, I'm curious.

793
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,251
In this enormous lifetime you describe,

794
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:04,101
have you ever been ill?

795
00:32:04,136 --> 00:32:05,917
Sure, as much as anyone.

796
00:32:05,952 --> 00:32:07,484
Seriously ill?

797
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,982
Sometimes.

798
00:32:09,017 --> 00:32:10,949
Of what? Do you know?

799
00:32:10,984 --> 00:32:12,550
In prehistory, I can't tell you.

800
00:32:12,585 --> 00:32:14,117
Maybe pneumonia once or twice.

801
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:18,015
Last few hundred years,

802
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:21,217
I've gotten over typhoid, yellow fever,

803
00:32:21,252 --> 00:32:24,384
smallpox... I survived the black plague.

804
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:25,683
Bubonic?

805
00:32:25,718 --> 00:32:27,082
Oh, that's terrible.

806
00:32:27,117 --> 00:32:28,815
More so than history describes.

807
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:32,384
And smallpox.
- But you're not scarred.

808
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:33,583
I don't scar.

809
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,984
No, John, that is not possible.

810
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,316
Please, let's take John's story

811
00:32:36,351 --> 00:32:39,467
at face value and explore
it from that perspective.

812
00:32:39,502 --> 00:32:42,584
If he doesn't scar, it's
no stranger than the rest.

813
00:32:42,619 --> 00:32:45,050
John, would you please stop by my lab,

814
00:32:45,085 --> 00:32:46,882
suffer a few tests from

815
00:32:46,917 --> 00:32:48,750
your friendly neighborhood biologist.

816
00:32:48,785 --> 00:32:50,082
I'm leery of labs.

817
00:32:50,117 --> 00:32:52,433
Afraid I might go in and
stay for a thousand years

818
00:32:52,468 --> 00:32:54,750
while cigarette smoking
men try to figure me out.

819
00:32:54,785 --> 00:32:56,618
You don't think that I would betray you?

820
00:32:56,653 --> 00:32:58,082
Walls have ears.

821
00:32:58,117 --> 00:33:00,618
Medical tests might be a
way of proving what you say.

822
00:33:00,653 --> 00:33:01,835
I don't wanna prove it.

823
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,010
So you're telling us this,

824
00:33:03,045 --> 00:33:04,115
the yarn of the century,

825
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,884
And you don't care if
we believe it or not?

826
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,585
I guess I shouldn't
have expected you to.

827
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,251
You're not as crazy as you think I am.

828
00:33:09,286 --> 00:33:10,216
Amen.

829
00:33:10,251 --> 00:33:11,717
I've always liked you.

830
00:33:11,752 --> 00:33:13,168
Why, thank you, dear.

831
00:33:13,203 --> 00:33:14,549
Now that's changing.

832
00:33:14,584 --> 00:33:16,082
Surely you don't believe this nonsense.

833
00:33:16,117 --> 00:33:18,150
I think we should remain
courteous to someone

834
00:33:18,185 --> 00:33:19,782
who we've known and trusted, Edith.

835
00:33:19,817 --> 00:33:22,517
Here you sit.
You can't break his story.

836
00:33:22,552 --> 00:33:25,217
All you can do is thumb your nose at it.

837
00:33:25,252 --> 00:33:27,251
Is that what you're doing, John?

838
00:33:27,286 --> 00:33:28,935
Are you laughing at us inside?

839
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,549
I wish you didn't feel that way.

840
00:33:30,584 --> 00:33:33,950
What you're saying -
it offends common sense.

841
00:33:33,985 --> 00:33:35,783
So does relativity, quantum mechanics-

842
00:33:35,818 --> 00:33:37,449
That's the way nature works.

843
00:33:37,484 --> 00:33:41,883
But your story doesn't fit
into nature as we know it.

844
00:33:41,918 --> 00:33:43,618
But we know so little, Dan.

845
00:33:44,684 --> 00:33:45,917
We know so little.

846
00:33:45,952 --> 00:33:47,115
How many of you know

847
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,434
five geniuses in your field

848
00:33:48,469 --> 00:33:49,683
that you disagree with...

849
00:33:49,718 --> 00:33:51,317
One you would like to strangle?

850
00:33:51,352 --> 00:33:53,482
Strangle them all.

851
00:33:53,517 --> 00:33:55,150
It's bad enough we have to listen

852
00:33:55,185 --> 00:33:56,418
to Harry's idiotic jokes.

853
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:57,616
Thank you very much, Edith.

854
00:33:57,651 --> 00:34:00,050
Maybe when I'm 110, I'll
be as smart as you are.

855
00:34:00,085 --> 00:34:01,517
If you lived as long as John did,

856
00:34:01,552 --> 00:34:03,201
you still wouldn't grow up.

857
00:34:03,236 --> 00:34:04,815
Come on, guys. Take it easy.

858
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:07,317
How often do we get to meet someone

859
00:34:07,352 --> 00:34:10,783
who says he's a stone age man?

860
00:34:10,818 --> 00:34:12,050
Well, once is enough.

861
00:34:12,085 --> 00:34:13,449
Edith.

862
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:15,584
All right. A guy with your mind-

863
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:17,649
you'd have studied a great deal.

864
00:34:17,684 --> 00:34:21,117
I have ten degrees,
including all of yours...

865
00:34:21,152 --> 00:34:23,516
Except yours, Will.

866
00:34:23,551 --> 00:34:25,718
That makes me feel a trifle lilliputian.

867
00:34:25,753 --> 00:34:28,082
That's over the span of 170 years.

868
00:34:28,117 --> 00:34:31,351
I got my biology degree
at Oxford in 1840,

869
00:34:31,386 --> 00:34:33,084
So I'm a little behind the times.

870
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,382
The same in other areas-

871
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:37,184
I can't keep up with the
new stuff that comes along.

872
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:38,149
No one can.

873
00:34:38,184 --> 00:34:39,484
Not even in their specialty.

874
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:41,049
So much for the myth

875
00:34:41,084 --> 00:34:42,817
of the super-wise,
all-knowing immortal.

876
00:34:42,852 --> 00:34:44,715
I see your point, John.

877
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,382
No matter how long a man lives,

878
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,516
he can't be in advance of his times.

879
00:34:48,551 --> 00:34:51,551
He can't know more than
the best of the race knows,

880
00:34:51,586 --> 00:34:54,551
if that- I mean, when the
world learned it was round,

881
00:34:54,586 --> 00:34:55,901
you learned it.

882
00:34:55,936 --> 00:34:57,260
It took some time.

883
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:58,549
News traveled slowly

884
00:34:58,584 --> 00:35:00,484
before communications were fancy.

885
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:03,115
There were social obstacles,

886
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:06,351
preconceptions, screams from the church.

887
00:35:06,386 --> 00:35:07,516
Ten doctorates.

888
00:35:07,551 --> 00:35:09,417
That's impressive,
John. Did you teach them?

889
00:35:09,452 --> 00:35:10,782
Some.

890
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,416
You might have all done the same.

891
00:35:13,451 --> 00:35:16,584
Living 14,000 years
didn't make me a genius.

892
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:17,917
I just had time.

893
00:35:17,952 --> 00:35:19,549
Time.

894
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,549
We can't see it, we can't hear it,

895
00:35:21,584 --> 00:35:25,284
we can't weigh it, we can't
measure it in a laboratory.

896
00:35:25,319 --> 00:35:27,549
It's a subjective sense of becoming

897
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:32,050
what we are instead of what
we were a nanosecond ago,

898
00:35:32,085 --> 00:35:34,484
becoming what we will
be in another nanosecond.

899
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:36,518
The Hopis see time as a landscape,

900
00:35:36,553 --> 00:35:39,002
existing before and behind us,

901
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:41,451
and we move--
we move through it,

902
00:35:41,486 --> 00:35:43,249
slice by slice.

903
00:35:43,284 --> 00:35:44,549
Clocks measure time.

904
00:35:44,584 --> 00:35:45,949
No, they measure themselves.

905
00:35:45,984 --> 00:35:48,349
The objective referent
of clock is another clock.

906
00:35:48,384 --> 00:35:50,783
How very interesting. What
has it got to do with John?

907
00:35:50,818 --> 00:35:52,815
Oh, he- he might be a man

908
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:57,883
who lives outside of time as we know it.

909
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,882
Yes, uh, well.

910
00:36:02,917 --> 00:36:06,033
People do go around armed these days.

911
00:36:06,068 --> 00:36:09,150
If I shot you, John...
You're immortal?

912
00:36:09,185 --> 00:36:11,115
Would you survive this?

913
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:13,917
I never said I was immortal, just old.

914
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,115
I might die.

915
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,549
And then you could wonder

916
00:36:16,584 --> 00:36:18,950
the rest of your incarcerated
life what you shot.

917
00:36:20,651 --> 00:36:23,417
Well, uh, may I?

918
00:36:25,084 --> 00:36:26,748
Preferable to a gun.

919
00:36:26,783 --> 00:36:30,050
Will, that was a bit much.

920
00:36:30,085 --> 00:36:32,701
Ooh. Books.

921
00:36:32,736 --> 00:36:35,282
Doctorates.

922
00:36:35,317 --> 00:36:38,533
Yes, you have grown and changed.

923
00:36:38,568 --> 00:36:40,959
But there is always innate nature.

924
00:36:40,994 --> 00:36:43,351
Wouldn't you be more comfortable

925
00:36:43,386 --> 00:36:44,984
squatting in the backyard?

926
00:36:45,019 --> 00:36:46,501
Sometimes I do, Will.

927
00:36:46,536 --> 00:36:47,984
Look up at the stars.

928
00:36:48,019 --> 00:36:49,015
Wonder.

929
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,451
And what did primitive man make of them?

930
00:36:51,486 --> 00:36:53,382
A great mystery.

931
00:36:53,417 --> 00:36:55,815
There were gods up there then.

932
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:58,351
Shamans who knew about them told us.

933
00:36:58,386 --> 00:36:59,618
They still do.

934
00:37:01,184 --> 00:37:03,084
Have you ever wished it would end?

935
00:37:05,718 --> 00:37:06,683
No.

936
00:37:06,718 --> 00:37:09,082
Fourteen thousand years.

937
00:37:09,117 --> 00:37:11,767
Injuries, illness, disasters.

938
00:37:11,802 --> 00:37:14,126
You've survived them all.

939
00:37:14,161 --> 00:37:16,451
You're a very lucky man.

940
00:37:21,769 --> 00:37:22,984
Come in.

941
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,050
John Oldman?

942
00:37:27,085 --> 00:37:28,416
Yes.

943
00:37:28,451 --> 00:37:30,351
Charity now. We're here
to pick up the furniture.

944
00:37:30,386 --> 00:37:32,149
It's all yours.

945
00:37:32,184 --> 00:37:33,416
Here, take this chair.

946
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:35,417
I'm gonna go drink in the corner.

947
00:37:37,384 --> 00:37:39,984
You're, uh... you're donating it?

948
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:41,218
Everything?

949
00:37:41,253 --> 00:37:42,382
I'll get more.

950
00:37:42,417 --> 00:37:43,950
Do you always travel this light?

951
00:37:43,985 --> 00:37:46,084
It's the only way to move.

952
00:37:47,783 --> 00:37:49,649
Oh, you-

953
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,216
You've talked a good deal

954
00:37:51,251 --> 00:37:54,484
about your extraordinary
amount of living.

955
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:56,684
What do you think of dying, John?

956
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:58,317
Do you fear death?

957
00:37:58,352 --> 00:37:59,616
Who wouldn't?

958
00:37:59,651 --> 00:38:01,784
How did primitive man regard death?

959
00:38:01,819 --> 00:38:03,917
Well, we had the practical concept.

960
00:38:03,952 --> 00:38:05,884
You know, we stopped,

961
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:07,782
fell down, didn't get up,

962
00:38:07,817 --> 00:38:10,017
Started to smell bad, come apart.

963
00:38:10,052 --> 00:38:12,182
Injuries we could understand.

964
00:38:12,217 --> 00:38:14,783
If someone's insides
were all over the ground.

965
00:38:14,818 --> 00:38:16,115
Infections...

966
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:20,618
They were, uh, mysterious.

967
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,182
Aging...

968
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,748
The biggest mystery of all.

969
00:38:24,783 --> 00:38:26,782
You realized you were different.

970
00:38:26,817 --> 00:38:29,883
<i>Longer to realize how I was different,</i>

971
00:38:29,918 --> 00:38:31,715
to find a way to synthesize

972
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,266
my experience into a view of myself.

973
00:38:34,301 --> 00:38:36,783
At first, I thought everybody had

974
00:38:36,818 --> 00:38:38,549
something wrong with them.

975
00:38:38,584 --> 00:38:42,184
They got old and they
died, animals, too...

976
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:43,249
but not me.

977
00:38:46,202 --> 00:38:49,050
Oh, forgive me, my dear.

978
00:38:49,085 --> 00:38:50,715
You live simply.

979
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:53,251
I've owned castles, but why leave a lot

980
00:38:53,286 --> 00:38:54,551
if you're always leaving?

981
00:38:54,586 --> 00:38:55,782
I have money.

982
00:38:55,817 --> 00:38:58,551
What, you get into
AT&T at 50 cents, John?

983
00:39:00,783 --> 00:39:02,482
As one grows older,

984
00:39:02,517 --> 00:39:07,850
the days, weeks, months
go by more quickly.

985
00:39:07,885 --> 00:39:10,951
What does a day or a year

986
00:39:10,986 --> 00:39:13,568
or a century mean to you?

987
00:39:13,603 --> 00:39:16,150
The birth-death cycle?

988
00:39:16,185 --> 00:39:17,801
Turbulence.

989
00:39:17,836 --> 00:39:19,382
I meet someone,

990
00:39:19,417 --> 00:39:22,251
learn their name, say
a word, they're gone.

991
00:39:22,286 --> 00:39:26,684
Others come like waves. Rise, fall.

992
00:39:28,251 --> 00:39:30,651
Ripples in a wheat
field, blown by the wind.

993
00:39:30,686 --> 00:39:33,384
Do you ever get tired of it all?

994
00:39:33,419 --> 00:39:34,815
I get bored now and then.

995
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:38,117
They keep making the same
stupid mistakes over and over.

996
00:39:38,152 --> 00:39:39,050
They.

997
00:39:40,117 --> 00:39:41,349
Then you see yourself

998
00:39:41,384 --> 00:39:43,584
as separate from the rest of humanity.

999
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:46,384
I didn't mean it that way.

1000
00:39:47,684 --> 00:39:48,850
But of course...

1001
00:39:50,017 --> 00:39:51,015
I am.

1002
00:39:52,417 --> 00:39:55,249
Are you comfortable
knowing that you have lived

1003
00:39:55,284 --> 00:39:59,150
while everyone you knew
- Everyone you knew, John! -

1004
00:39:59,185 --> 00:40:00,316
has died?

1005
00:40:00,351 --> 00:40:02,117
I've regretted losing people...

1006
00:40:02,152 --> 00:40:03,149
often.

1007
00:40:03,184 --> 00:40:05,584
Have you ever felt guilt about that,

1008
00:40:05,619 --> 00:40:07,868
something akin to survivor's guilt?

1009
00:40:07,903 --> 00:40:10,117
In the strict psychological sense?

1010
00:40:10,152 --> 00:40:11,484
I suppose I have.

1011
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:12,618
Yeah.

1012
00:40:14,084 --> 00:40:16,184
But what can I do about it?

1013
00:40:18,184 --> 00:40:19,684
Indeed.

1014
00:40:20,783 --> 00:40:22,017
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1015
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:23,216
Gentlemen, I'm-

1016
00:40:23,251 --> 00:40:25,184
I'm gonna keep the couch.

1017
00:40:25,219 --> 00:40:26,149
Thanks.

1018
00:40:26,184 --> 00:40:28,349
Ladies? Will? Oh, no...

1019
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:31,017
You've got a heart condition.
Don't grump about it.

1020
00:40:31,052 --> 00:40:32,817
Hey, how about changing
the subject, Will?

1021
00:40:32,852 --> 00:40:34,616
Enough with the- with the dying.

1022
00:40:34,651 --> 00:40:38,351
But this is the flip
side of his coin, Harry.

1023
00:40:38,386 --> 00:40:41,149
I'm very curious to know his feelings.

1024
00:40:41,184 --> 00:40:44,084
Would you prefer I asked
him about his father?

1025
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:45,517
I thought you always started with

1026
00:40:45,552 --> 00:40:46,882
"Tell me about your mother."

1027
00:40:46,917 --> 00:40:49,950
Yes, but prehistory was
strongly patriarchal.

1028
00:40:49,985 --> 00:40:53,101
Surely you remember your father.

1029
00:40:53,136 --> 00:40:56,182
I seem to remember a figure,

1030
00:40:56,217 --> 00:40:59,150
Perhaps an older brother,
a social father, maybe.

1031
00:40:59,185 --> 00:41:00,848
Well, no matter.

1032
00:41:00,883 --> 00:41:03,251
I can scarcely remember mine.

1033
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,282
Do you feel a vacancy

1034
00:41:07,317 --> 00:41:09,334
in your life about that, John,

1035
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:11,351
something you wish could be filled

1036
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:14,251
by a face, a voice, an image?

1037
00:41:16,651 --> 00:41:18,115
Not at this late date.

1038
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:20,451
There must be
someone - probably many -

1039
00:41:20,486 --> 00:41:22,184
that you valued intensely.

1040
00:41:22,219 --> 00:41:23,583
Loved.

1041
00:41:23,618 --> 00:41:27,115
You saw them age and die -

1042
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:30,583
a friend, a colleague, a wife.

1043
00:41:30,618 --> 00:41:33,917
Certainly you've had wives and children?

1044
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,316
I'd move on.

1045
00:41:35,351 --> 00:41:37,149
I had to move on.

1046
00:41:37,184 --> 00:41:39,883
Making him history's biggest bigamist.

1047
00:41:40,984 --> 00:41:43,651
Have you ever in your life thought

1048
00:41:43,686 --> 00:41:45,284
"It should have been me"?

1049
00:41:47,551 --> 00:41:48,616
Maybe.

1050
00:41:48,651 --> 00:41:50,115
Yeah, Art has told me

1051
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,915
that some of your early fellows

1052
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:54,633
feared you were stealing their lives.

1053
00:41:54,668 --> 00:41:57,317
Have you thought that perhaps you were?

1054
00:41:57,352 --> 00:41:58,782
Perhaps you are!

1055
00:41:58,817 --> 00:42:02,017
There have always been
legends of such a thing,

1056
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:04,082
a creature not quite human

1057
00:42:04,117 --> 00:42:08,184
taking not the blood,
but the life force itself?

1058
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:09,482
My God, Will.

1059
00:42:09,517 --> 00:42:11,949
Unconsciously, perhaps,

1060
00:42:11,984 --> 00:42:15,984
by some biological or psychic mechanism

1061
00:42:16,019 --> 00:42:17,982
that we can only guess at.

1062
00:42:18,017 --> 00:42:21,017
I'm not saying you would do
such a thing deliberately.

1063
00:42:21,052 --> 00:42:24,084
I'm not saying that you
would even know how to...

1064
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:25,417
Would you?

1065
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:29,850
But would such a thing be fair?

1066
00:42:29,885 --> 00:42:31,516
So you believe me now?

1067
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:34,882
I'm only exploring what you have said.

1068
00:42:34,917 --> 00:42:38,817
Whether I believe it or
not is of no importance.

1069
00:42:38,852 --> 00:42:40,634
We will die.

1070
00:42:40,669 --> 00:42:42,382
You will live.

1071
00:42:42,417 --> 00:42:44,551
Will you come to my funeral, John?

1072
00:42:44,586 --> 00:42:45,835
Hey, Will...

1073
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,049
You've gone too far.

1074
00:42:47,084 --> 00:42:49,750
John didn't ask to be what he is.

1075
00:42:49,785 --> 00:42:52,417
And we did not ask to hear about it.

1076
00:42:52,452 --> 00:42:53,949
But if it were true,

1077
00:42:53,984 --> 00:42:57,050
is there one among us
who would not feel envy,

1078
00:42:57,085 --> 00:42:59,551
even perhaps a touch of hatred?

1079
00:43:01,317 --> 00:43:03,267
You told us of yourself, John.

1080
00:43:03,302 --> 00:43:05,217
Can you imagine how we feel?

1081
00:43:05,252 --> 00:43:07,334
I never thought of that.

1082
00:43:07,369 --> 00:43:09,382
Since you may not die,

1083
00:43:09,417 --> 00:43:12,182
while we most assuredly will...

1084
00:43:12,217 --> 00:43:14,384
There must be a reason for that, no?

1085
00:43:14,419 --> 00:43:16,251
Perhaps you are an expert.

1086
00:43:17,651 --> 00:43:20,184
Uh, that's it, Mr. Oldman.
Have a good one.

1087
00:43:20,219 --> 00:43:21,917
Thank you. You too.

1088
00:43:25,684 --> 00:43:27,750
Or are you a vampire, John?

1089
00:43:28,883 --> 00:43:30,517
Even an unknowing one.

1090
00:43:31,584 --> 00:43:33,249
Do you stand alive and tall

1091
00:43:33,284 --> 00:43:35,417
in a graveyard that you helped to fill?

1092
00:43:35,452 --> 00:43:36,915
That's going too far.

1093
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,850
Bored, perhaps lonely,
because your heart

1094
00:43:39,885 --> 00:43:41,901
cannot keep its treasures.

1095
00:43:41,936 --> 00:43:43,917
Is that what you're doing?

1096
00:43:45,317 --> 00:43:47,284
Have you led a wrongful life?

1097
00:43:48,384 --> 00:43:50,384
Well, then, perhaps

1098
00:43:51,517 --> 00:43:53,317
it is time to die.

1099
00:43:55,084 --> 00:43:56,316
Wait a minute, now.

1100
00:43:56,351 --> 00:43:58,316
Look, I don't know what John is doing,

1101
00:43:58,351 --> 00:44:00,782
But I sure as hell don't
like what you're doing.

1102
00:44:00,817 --> 00:44:03,251
Give me that gun or I'm
gonna break your goddamn arm.

1103
00:44:03,286 --> 00:44:06,584
You sound like our football coach, Dan.

1104
00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:08,551
What do you think, John?

1105
00:44:08,586 --> 00:44:10,516
A shot to the arm?

1106
00:44:10,551 --> 00:44:13,451
Perhaps we could watch it heal.

1107
00:44:13,486 --> 00:44:15,634
A bullet in the head...

1108
00:44:15,669 --> 00:44:17,783
What exactly will happen?

1109
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,915
I have papers to correct.

1110
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:28,667
As much as I dislike that job,

1111
00:44:28,702 --> 00:44:31,384
it'll be preferable to this.

1112
00:44:32,984 --> 00:44:35,050
I leave you with it.

1113
00:44:37,384 --> 00:44:39,683
Jesus Christ.

1114
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,651
What the hell was that all about?

1115
00:44:41,686 --> 00:44:42,949
Where'd he get a gun?

1116
00:44:42,984 --> 00:44:44,567
He had you on the ropes, John.

1117
00:44:44,602 --> 00:44:46,150
Are you really so damn smart?

1118
00:44:46,185 --> 00:44:47,517
It's not like Will.

1119
00:44:49,384 --> 00:44:51,217
Mary passed away yesterday.

1120
00:44:53,718 --> 00:44:54,949
Who?

1121
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:57,384
His wife.

1122
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:00,584
She had, uh, pancreatic cancer.

1123
00:45:02,484 --> 00:45:03,551
Will!

1124
00:45:05,184 --> 00:45:06,882
I didn't know about Mary.

1125
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:10,317
I'm sorry. I can see how
this might have hit you.

1126
00:45:10,352 --> 00:45:14,251
Please, permit me to
be infantile by myself.

1127
00:45:14,286 --> 00:45:16,584
Will, please.

1128
00:45:33,184 --> 00:45:35,033
What the hell were you thinking, Art?

1129
00:45:35,068 --> 00:45:36,883
Oh, come on. Something had to be done.

1130
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:38,301
I have to say I agree.

1131
00:45:38,336 --> 00:45:39,649
And he's our friend.

1132
00:45:39,684 --> 00:45:41,917
Whatever else on Earth is going on,

1133
00:45:41,952 --> 00:45:43,018
He's our friend!

1134
00:45:43,053 --> 00:45:44,049
You sure about that?

1135
00:45:44,084 --> 00:45:45,649
Why are you being so hard on him?

1136
00:45:45,684 --> 00:45:48,384
One of my favorite
people has disappeared.

1137
00:45:48,419 --> 00:45:51,751
Can you get Alzheimer's at 35?

1138
00:45:51,786 --> 00:45:55,084
Maybe I'm trying to wake him up.

1139
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,718
Maybe I'm too sad to cry.

1140
00:46:03,017 --> 00:46:05,984
What I said about myself hurt him.

1141
00:46:06,019 --> 00:46:08,382
He struck back expertly.

1142
00:46:08,417 --> 00:46:11,183
That stuff about stealing life forces?

1143
00:46:11,218 --> 00:46:13,950
I've always wondered about the reasons.

1144
00:46:20,317 --> 00:46:23,618
Well, we still have an
afternoon to kill, right?

1145
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,517
Charades?

1146
00:46:29,718 --> 00:46:31,915
No. John?

1147
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:34,618
I have a charade, and
it is just for you.

1148
00:46:34,653 --> 00:46:35,649
Sandy, come here.

1149
00:46:35,684 --> 00:46:37,334
Come on, come on, come on.

1150
00:46:37,369 --> 00:46:38,984
Okay, this one's for you.

1151
00:46:39,019 --> 00:46:40,949
Ready?

1152
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:53,467
Ooh!

1153
00:46:53,502 --> 00:46:54,949
Unh.

1154
00:46:54,984 --> 00:46:56,600
My first wedding?

1155
00:46:56,635 --> 00:46:58,143
There you go.

1156
00:46:58,178 --> 00:46:59,616
There you go!

1157
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:02,351
Very good, and I bet at least one of us

1158
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:03,516
is your direct descendent.

1159
00:47:03,551 --> 00:47:05,617
And I didn't even send a Christmas card.

1160
00:47:05,652 --> 00:47:07,818
Christmas card? What
about a birthday card?

1161
00:47:07,853 --> 00:47:09,984
And don't even get me
started on the candles...

1162
00:47:10,019 --> 00:47:11,984
with the blowing and the

1163
00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:13,883
for years with the blowing.

1164
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:17,882
Yeah, all right. I tried.

1165
00:47:17,917 --> 00:47:21,184
Well, uh, call me underdeveloped,

1166
00:47:21,219 --> 00:47:23,551
but I'd like to hear more.

1167
00:47:25,783 --> 00:47:27,100
Me too.

1168
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,382
More.

1169
00:47:28,417 --> 00:47:30,783
You double-damn swear
this isn't some cockamamie

1170
00:47:30,818 --> 00:47:32,984
science fiction story or...

1171
00:47:33,019 --> 00:47:34,351
you're pulling on us?

1172
00:47:34,386 --> 00:47:36,848
Next question.

1173
00:47:36,883 --> 00:47:38,217
You-You-You realize

1174
00:47:38,252 --> 00:47:39,516
this is an invitation

1175
00:47:39,551 --> 00:47:41,718
to men in white suits with happy pills.

1176
00:47:41,753 --> 00:47:42,748
Think about it.

1177
00:47:42,783 --> 00:47:44,618
A mechanism allowing survival

1178
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:45,982
for thousands of years?

1179
00:47:46,017 --> 00:47:48,249
Run out of room even faster.

1180
00:47:48,284 --> 00:47:50,551
Then we'd have to go to Mars as a colony

1181
00:47:50,586 --> 00:47:52,451
as we expanded, as we'd have to.

1182
00:47:52,486 --> 00:47:54,382
I'd like that.

1183
00:47:54,417 --> 00:47:56,384
On a planet of another star.

1184
00:47:56,419 --> 00:47:58,249
I envy you.

1185
00:47:58,284 --> 00:48:00,616
Did you have a pet dinosaur?

1186
00:48:00,651 --> 00:48:03,017
They were a little bit before my time.

1187
00:48:03,052 --> 00:48:04,249
At least something is.

1188
00:48:04,284 --> 00:48:07,351
No doubt you could give us
a thousand details, John,

1189
00:48:07,386 --> 00:48:08,416
corroborating your story,

1190
00:48:08,451 --> 00:48:10,917
from the Magdalene to the Buddha to now.

1191
00:48:10,952 --> 00:48:12,082
Ten thousand,

1192
00:48:12,117 --> 00:48:13,718
and you could stay out of the books.

1193
00:48:13,753 --> 00:48:16,182
Oh, it's getting chilly.

1194
00:48:16,217 --> 00:48:18,417
Here, come over here. Join me.

1195
00:48:20,783 --> 00:48:24,417
That, uh, raises an
interesting question, John.

1196
00:48:24,452 --> 00:48:25,915
Could there be others like you

1197
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:28,150
who escaped the aging
process as you have?

1198
00:48:28,185 --> 00:48:29,534
Representing something terrific

1199
00:48:29,569 --> 00:48:30,883
we don't even know about in biology.

1200
00:48:30,918 --> 00:48:32,151
We're learning all the time.

1201
00:48:32,186 --> 00:48:33,349
Yeah, but how would he know?

1202
00:48:33,384 --> 00:48:36,417
He doesn't wear an I.D. badge
saying "yabba dabba doo."

1203
00:48:36,452 --> 00:48:39,068
There was a man in the 1600s.

1204
00:48:39,103 --> 00:48:41,649
Where were you in 1292 A.D.?

1205
00:48:41,684 --> 00:48:44,284
Where were you a year ago on this date?

1206
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:49,718
Anyway, it was the
1600s, and I met a man,

1207
00:48:49,753 --> 00:48:52,451
and I had a hunch that he was...

1208
00:48:52,486 --> 00:48:54,382
like me, so I told him.

1209
00:48:54,417 --> 00:48:58,184
Ah. See, you said this was a first.

1210
00:48:58,219 --> 00:48:59,182
I forgot.

1211
00:48:59,217 --> 00:49:01,084
A crack in your story, John?

1212
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,118
A touch of senility.

1213
00:49:03,153 --> 00:49:05,082
Anyway, he said yes,

1214
00:49:05,117 --> 00:49:07,117
but from another time, another place.

1215
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:08,649
We talked for two days.

1216
00:49:08,684 --> 00:49:10,651
It was all pretty convincing,

1217
00:49:10,686 --> 00:49:12,915
But we couldn't be sure.

1218
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,217
We each confirmed what the other said,

1219
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:17,484
but how do we know if the confirmation

1220
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:19,284
was genuine or an echo?

1221
00:49:19,319 --> 00:49:21,015
I knew I was kosher,

1222
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:24,950
but I thought, "maybe he's
playing a game on me."

1223
00:49:24,985 --> 00:49:28,349
You know, a scholar
of all we spoke about.

1224
00:49:28,384 --> 00:49:31,417
He said he was inclined
with the same reservation.

1225
00:49:31,452 --> 00:49:32,649
Now, that's interesting.

1226
00:49:32,684 --> 00:49:34,850
Just as we can never be sure,

1227
00:49:34,885 --> 00:49:36,434
even if we wanted to.

1228
00:49:36,469 --> 00:49:37,949
I mean, if we were sure,

1229
00:49:37,984 --> 00:49:39,649
you couldn't be sure of that.

1230
00:49:39,684 --> 00:49:41,783
We parted, agreeing to keep in touch

1231
00:49:41,818 --> 00:49:43,216
- of course, we didn't -

1232
00:49:43,251 --> 00:49:45,718
and 200 years later I thought I saw him

1233
00:49:45,753 --> 00:49:47,984
in a train station in Brussels.

1234
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:49,551
Lost him in the crowd.

1235
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:51,715
Oh, what a shame.

1236
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,550
I- I mean, if it were true.

1237
00:49:53,585 --> 00:49:55,316
Okay, here's one for you.

1238
00:49:55,351 --> 00:49:57,651
What do you do in your spare time?

1239
00:49:58,817 --> 00:49:59,915
Every 50 years or so,

1240
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:01,815
when I wanna get away from the rush,

1241
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:04,234
I go down to a primitive
tribe in New Guinea

1242
00:50:04,269 --> 00:50:06,618
where I'm worshipped as an immortal god,

1243
00:50:06,653 --> 00:50:09,017
and they have a huge statue of me.

1244
00:50:09,052 --> 00:50:10,216
It's a big party.

1245
00:50:10,251 --> 00:50:12,217
Yeah, I've got a lot of pictures of it,

1246
00:50:12,252 --> 00:50:14,149
but I've already packed
them up. I'm sorry.

1247
00:50:14,184 --> 00:50:17,917
I won't make the obvious nasty
crack about more unwashed cavemen.

1248
00:50:17,952 --> 00:50:19,282
Actually, bathing was the style

1249
00:50:19,317 --> 00:50:21,184
until the middle ages
when the church told us

1250
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:24,050
it was sinful to wash away God's dirt,

1251
00:50:24,085 --> 00:50:25,282
so people were sewn

1252
00:50:25,317 --> 00:50:26,967
into their underwear in October

1253
00:50:27,002 --> 00:50:28,709
and they popped out in April.

1254
00:50:28,744 --> 00:50:30,417
You said you just happened.

1255
00:50:30,452 --> 00:50:32,284
I don't believe that.

1256
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,082
If your story's true,

1257
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:37,033
why did God allow you to happen?

1258
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:39,950
That makes an interesting point.

1259
00:50:39,985 --> 00:50:41,616
Are you religious, John?

1260
00:50:41,651 --> 00:50:44,184
I don't follow a known religion. No.

1261
00:50:44,219 --> 00:50:45,249
Ever.

1262
00:50:45,284 --> 00:50:47,567
Long time ago I did,

1263
00:50:47,602 --> 00:50:49,815
like most people.

1264
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:51,651
Some just never get over it.

1265
00:50:51,686 --> 00:50:53,050
Do you believe in God?

1266
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:55,915
As Laplace said,

1267
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:58,584
"I have no need of that hypothesis."

1268
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:00,115
He may be around, though.

1269
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:02,800
He's everywhere. We just can't see him.

1270
00:51:02,835 --> 00:51:05,451
Pfft. If this was the best I could do,

1271
00:51:05,486 --> 00:51:07,001
I'd be hiding, too.

1272
00:51:07,036 --> 00:51:08,482
And creation...

1273
00:51:08,517 --> 00:51:10,850
It's here.
- I'm not so sure it was created.

1274
00:51:10,885 --> 00:51:12,182
What then?

1275
00:51:12,217 --> 00:51:15,783
Maybe it's just accumulated,
fields affecting fields.

1276
00:51:15,818 --> 00:51:18,451
What about the source
of the field energies?

1277
00:51:18,486 --> 00:51:20,416
Wouldn't that imply a prime mover?

1278
00:51:20,451 --> 00:51:22,549
I'd wonder about the
source of the prime mover,

1279
00:51:22,584 --> 00:51:25,783
infinite regress, but that
doesn't imply anything to me.

1280
00:51:25,818 --> 00:51:27,549
Back to the mystery.

1281
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,616
It's a very old question,

1282
00:51:29,651 --> 00:51:33,517
But there's no answer
except in religious terms.

1283
00:51:33,552 --> 00:51:36,249
If you have faith, it's answered.

1284
00:51:36,284 --> 00:51:39,718
Did you ever meet any person
from our religious history?

1285
00:51:39,753 --> 00:51:41,783
A biblical figure?

1286
00:51:41,818 --> 00:51:43,117
In a way.

1287
00:51:43,152 --> 00:51:44,815
Who?

1288
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:46,316
We should skip this one.

1289
00:51:46,351 --> 00:51:48,050
No, no, no skipping. Come on.

1290
00:51:48,085 --> 00:51:49,301
Next question.

1291
00:51:49,336 --> 00:51:50,710
No, come on!

1292
00:51:52,084 --> 00:51:53,349
Come on, spit it out!

1293
00:51:53,384 --> 00:51:55,015
Good lord! You were one of them!

1294
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:58,684
This is going in a direction
that I didn't expect.

1295
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:01,901
I hoped it wouldn't.
We... call it a night.

1296
00:52:01,936 --> 00:52:05,084
Come on! You were someone
in religious history?

1297
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:06,316
Yes.

1298
00:52:06,351 --> 00:52:07,883
In the Bible?

1299
00:52:07,918 --> 00:52:08,848
Yes.

1300
00:52:08,883 --> 00:52:09,915
Someone we know?

1301
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:11,984
How could we not know
someone in the Bible?

1302
00:52:12,019 --> 00:52:13,451
I mean somebody important.

1303
00:52:13,486 --> 00:52:14,883
You may think you know him,

1304
00:52:14,918 --> 00:52:16,416
but it's mostly myth.

1305
00:52:16,451 --> 00:52:19,800
The entire Bible is
mostly myth and allegory

1306
00:52:19,835 --> 00:52:23,150
with maybe some basis
in historical events.

1307
00:52:23,185 --> 00:52:27,484
You were part of that history?

1308
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,584
Yes.

1309
00:52:29,718 --> 00:52:30,949
Moses.

1310
00:52:30,984 --> 00:52:34,817
Moses was based on Misis, a Syrian myth,

1311
00:52:34,852 --> 00:52:36,684
and there are earlier versions.

1312
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:38,482
All found floating on water,

1313
00:52:38,517 --> 00:52:41,050
the staff that changed to a snake,

1314
00:52:41,085 --> 00:52:43,584
waters that were parted so followers

1315
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:45,151
could be led to freedom

1316
00:52:45,186 --> 00:52:46,649
and even receive laws

1317
00:52:46,684 --> 00:52:48,251
on stone or wooden tablets.

1318
00:52:48,286 --> 00:52:51,149
One of the apostles.

1319
00:52:51,184 --> 00:52:53,600
They weren't really apostles.

1320
00:52:53,635 --> 00:52:55,982
They didn't do any real teaching.

1321
00:52:56,017 --> 00:52:59,317
Peter the fisherman learned
a little more about fishing.

1322
00:52:59,352 --> 00:53:01,351
How do you know that?

1323
00:53:03,783 --> 00:53:06,750
The mythical overlay is so enormous...

1324
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:10,182
and not good.

1325
00:53:10,217 --> 00:53:16,382
The truth is so, so simple.

1326
00:53:16,417 --> 00:53:20,117
The New Testament in 100
words or less: you ready?

1327
00:53:20,152 --> 00:53:21,718
I don't think I wanna hear this.

1328
00:53:21,753 --> 00:53:23,249
Harry, will you take me home?

1329
00:53:23,284 --> 00:53:25,115
No, not right now.
I do want to hear this.

1330
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:27,517
Sit down, Edith.
You act like you believe him.

1331
00:53:27,552 --> 00:53:28,915
It's sacrilege.

1332
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:30,149
How can it be sacrilege?

1333
00:53:30,184 --> 00:53:31,282
He hasn't said anything yet.

1334
00:53:31,317 --> 00:53:33,934
The new New Testament is sacrilege.

1335
00:53:33,969 --> 00:53:36,826
There are a dozen new New Testaments,

1336
00:53:36,861 --> 00:53:39,684
From Hebrew to Greek
to Latin to Tyndale,

1337
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:41,517
all the way to King James,

1338
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:42,848
all revisionist,

1339
00:53:42,883 --> 00:53:45,115
and all called revealed truth.

1340
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:48,316
I mean a new New Testament in 100 words.

1341
00:53:48,351 --> 00:53:50,651
I can give you the ten
commandments in ten words:

1342
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:52,216
Don't. Don't, don't, don't,

1343
00:53:52,251 --> 00:53:54,050
Don't, don't, don't,
don't, don't, don't.

1344
00:53:54,085 --> 00:53:55,649
Don't.

1345
00:53:55,684 --> 00:53:58,750
The commandments are just modern
updates of more ancient laws.

1346
00:53:58,785 --> 00:54:00,583
Hammurabi's code.

1347
00:54:00,618 --> 00:54:03,117
That's right, they
weren't the first, right?

1348
00:54:03,152 --> 00:54:06,084
Edith, I was raised on the Torah...

1349
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:07,549
My wife, on the Koran.

1350
00:54:07,584 --> 00:54:09,217
My oldest son is an atheist.

1351
00:54:09,252 --> 00:54:11,067
My youngest is a Scientologist.

1352
00:54:11,102 --> 00:54:12,848
My daughter is studying Hinduism.

1353
00:54:12,883 --> 00:54:17,117
I imagine that there is room there
for a holy war in my living room,

1354
00:54:17,152 --> 00:54:19,317
but we practice live and let live.

1355
00:54:20,651 --> 00:54:22,084
Why don't you sit down?

1356
00:54:29,184 --> 00:54:32,117
What is your preferred
version of the Bible?

1357
00:54:32,152 --> 00:54:33,583
The King James, of course.

1358
00:54:33,618 --> 00:54:36,084
It's the most modern, the
work of great scholars.

1359
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:37,584
Modern is good.

1360
00:54:39,384 --> 00:54:41,618
All right, John,
hit us with the short form.

1361
00:54:43,651 --> 00:54:45,684
Guy met the Buddha, liked what he heard,

1362
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:47,518
thought about it for a while -

1363
00:54:47,553 --> 00:54:49,317
say 500 years, while he returned

1364
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:51,318
to the Mediterranean,

1365
00:54:51,353 --> 00:54:53,249
became an Etruscan.

1366
00:54:53,284 --> 00:54:55,001
Seeped into the Roman empire.

1367
00:54:55,036 --> 00:54:56,718
He didn't like what they became -

1368
00:54:56,753 --> 00:54:58,949
A giant killing machine.

1369
00:54:58,984 --> 00:55:00,683
He went to the Near East thinking,

1370
00:55:00,718 --> 00:55:03,984
"Why not pass the Buddha's
teachings on in a modern form."

1371
00:55:04,019 --> 00:55:06,216
So he tried.

1372
00:55:06,251 --> 00:55:08,417
One dissident against Rome?

1373
00:55:08,452 --> 00:55:09,583
Rome won.

1374
00:55:09,618 --> 00:55:10,982
The rest is history.

1375
00:55:11,017 --> 00:55:13,484
Well, sort of. Lot of
fairy tales mixed in.

1376
00:55:16,317 --> 00:55:18,282
I knew it.

1377
00:55:18,317 --> 00:55:20,250
He's saying he was Christ.

1378
00:55:20,285 --> 00:55:22,149
Oh, no. That's the medal

1379
00:55:22,184 --> 00:55:24,517
they pinned on Jesus
to fulfill prophecy.

1380
00:55:24,552 --> 00:55:25,715
The crucifixion.

1381
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:28,750
He blocked the pain
as he had learned to do

1382
00:55:28,785 --> 00:55:30,115
in Tibet and India.

1383
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:32,516
He also learned to
slow his body processes

1384
00:55:32,551 --> 00:55:35,150
down to the point where
they were undetectable.

1385
00:55:35,185 --> 00:55:36,584
They thought he was dead.

1386
00:55:36,619 --> 00:55:37,949
So his followers pulled him

1387
00:55:37,984 --> 00:55:40,282
from the cross, placed him in a cave...

1388
00:55:40,317 --> 00:55:42,950
His body normalized as
he had trained it to.

1389
00:55:44,217 --> 00:55:46,683
He attempted to go away undetected,

1390
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:49,150
but some devotees were standing watch.

1391
00:55:50,584 --> 00:55:53,034
Tried to explain.

1392
00:55:53,069 --> 00:55:55,449
They were ecstatic.

1393
00:55:55,484 --> 00:55:57,949
Thus, I was resurrected,

1394
00:55:57,984 --> 00:56:00,000
and I ascended to central Europe

1395
00:56:00,035 --> 00:56:01,982
to get away as far as possible.

1396
00:56:02,017 --> 00:56:04,484
You don't mean a word of this, John.

1397
00:56:04,519 --> 00:56:06,484
My God, why are you doing this?

1398
00:56:06,519 --> 00:56:08,050
Let me see your wrists.

1399
00:56:08,085 --> 00:56:09,516
I don't scar.

1400
00:56:09,551 --> 00:56:11,182
Besides, they tied me...

1401
00:56:11,217 --> 00:56:14,384
but nails and blood make
better religious art.

1402
00:56:14,419 --> 00:56:17,551
All the speculations about Jesus.

1403
00:56:17,586 --> 00:56:19,316
He was black, he was Asian,

1404
00:56:19,351 --> 00:56:21,834
he was a blue-eyed Aryan
with a golden beard

1405
00:56:21,869 --> 00:56:24,282
and hair straight out
of Vidal Sassoon's,

1406
00:56:24,317 --> 00:56:27,484
He was a benevolent alien,
he never existed at all.

1407
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:29,616
Now he's a caveman.

1408
00:56:29,651 --> 00:56:32,750
The Christ figure goes all
the way back to Krishna -

1409
00:56:32,785 --> 00:56:33,834
Hercules, of course.

1410
00:56:33,869 --> 00:56:34,848
Hercules?

1411
00:56:34,883 --> 00:56:37,550
Born of a virgin, Alcmene.

1412
00:56:37,585 --> 00:56:40,217
A god for a father, Zeus.

1413
00:56:40,252 --> 00:56:42,848
The only begotten.

1414
00:56:42,883 --> 00:56:45,449
<i>The savior
- The greek? Soter.</i>

1415
00:56:45,484 --> 00:56:47,616
The good shepherd, the prince of peace,

1416
00:56:47,651 --> 00:56:50,184
bringing gentle persuasion
and divine wisdom.

1417
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:53,018
He died, joined his father on Olympus

1418
00:56:53,053 --> 00:56:55,782
a thousand years before Gethsemane.

1419
00:56:55,817 --> 00:56:59,684
How can you compare pagan
mythology to the true word?

1420
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:02,251
Pretty damn closely, I'd say.

1421
00:57:02,286 --> 00:57:04,748
The early Christian leaders,

1422
00:57:04,783 --> 00:57:06,683
they threw away Hebrew manuscripts

1423
00:57:06,718 --> 00:57:09,618
and borrowed from pagan
sources all over the place.

1424
00:57:09,653 --> 00:57:12,249
Do you realize how...

1425
00:57:12,284 --> 00:57:14,516
inconsiderately you're
treating my feelings?

1426
00:57:14,551 --> 00:57:18,050
About as inconsiderately
as we're treating John's.

1427
00:57:18,085 --> 00:57:20,316
Well, he doesn't
believe what he's saying!

1428
00:57:20,351 --> 00:57:22,917
Do you believe literally
everything in the Bible, Edith?

1429
00:57:22,952 --> 00:57:24,049
Yes!

1430
00:57:24,084 --> 00:57:25,449
Before you say it,

1431
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:28,150
I know it's undergone a lot of changes,

1432
00:57:28,185 --> 00:57:30,651
But God has spoken through man

1433
00:57:30,686 --> 00:57:32,683
to make his word clearer.

1434
00:57:32,718 --> 00:57:35,115
He couldn't get it right the first time?

1435
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:38,350
We're imperfect! He had to
work to make us understand.

1436
00:57:38,385 --> 00:57:41,516
<i>He couldn't get us right
the first time, Edith?</i>

1437
00:57:41,551 --> 00:57:44,351
Taken alone, the
philosophical teachings of Jesus

1438
00:57:44,386 --> 00:57:46,482
are Buddhism with a Hebrew accent.

1439
00:57:46,517 --> 00:57:50,284
Kindness, tolerance, brotherhood, love,

1440
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:51,982
a ruthless realism acknowledging

1441
00:57:52,017 --> 00:57:55,251
that life is as it is here
on Earth, here and now.

1442
00:57:55,286 --> 00:57:58,385
The kingdom of God, meaning goodness,

1443
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:01,484
is right here, where it should be.

1444
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:03,583
"I am what I am becoming."

1445
00:58:03,618 --> 00:58:05,184
That's what the Buddha brought in.

1446
00:58:05,219 --> 00:58:06,583
And that's what I taught.

1447
00:58:06,618 --> 00:58:09,584
But a talking snake
make a lady eat an apple,

1448
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:10,715
So we're screwed.

1449
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:12,282
Heaven and hell were peddled

1450
00:58:12,317 --> 00:58:15,567
so priests could rule
through seduction and terror,

1451
00:58:15,602 --> 00:58:18,817
save our souls that we never
lost in the first place.

1452
00:58:18,852 --> 00:58:20,449
I threw a clean pass...

1453
00:58:20,484 --> 00:58:22,584
they ran it out of the ballpark.

1454
00:58:22,619 --> 00:58:25,316
This is blasphemy.

1455
00:58:25,351 --> 00:58:28,167
It's horrible! Who else were you?

1456
00:58:28,202 --> 00:58:30,492
Solomon, Elvis, Jack the ripper?

1457
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,605
It's been said that Buddha and Jesus

1458
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,684
would laugh or cry if they'd known

1459
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,115
what was done in their name.

1460
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:37,950
And if there is a creator,

1461
00:58:37,985 --> 00:58:40,834
he'd probably feel the same way.

1462
00:58:40,869 --> 00:58:43,443
I see ceremony, ritual, processions,

1463
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:46,147
genuflecting, moaning, intoning,

1464
00:58:46,182 --> 00:58:48,817
venerating cookies and wine,

1465
00:58:48,852 --> 00:58:50,583
and I think...

1466
00:58:50,618 --> 00:58:51,984
It's not what I had in mind.

1467
00:58:52,019 --> 00:58:53,316
But that's Vatican flapdoodle.

1468
00:58:53,351 --> 00:58:55,817
It doesn't have a thing to do with God.

1469
00:58:55,852 --> 00:58:59,001
As you said, John,
everywhere, religions...

1470
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:02,150
from exalting life to
purging joy as a sin.

1471
00:59:02,185 --> 00:59:04,817
Rome does it as grand opera.

1472
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,883
A simple path to goodness needs

1473
00:59:07,918 --> 00:59:09,850
a supernatural roadmap.

1474
00:59:09,885 --> 00:59:11,982
Supernatural...

1475
00:59:12,017 --> 00:59:14,649
A stupid word, I mean...

1476
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:16,584
Anything that happens,
happens within nature,

1477
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:18,718
whether we believe in it or not.

1478
00:59:18,753 --> 00:59:20,817
Like a 14,000-year-old caveman.

1479
00:59:29,651 --> 00:59:31,800
I- I-I drove for a while,

1480
00:59:31,835 --> 00:59:33,950
and then I sat for a while.

1481
00:59:33,985 --> 00:59:35,349
I'm so ashamed.

1482
00:59:35,384 --> 00:59:37,084
And I'm freezing.

1483
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:38,349
Well, come inside.

1484
00:59:38,384 --> 00:59:40,517
I still don't believe you, of course.

1485
00:59:40,552 --> 00:59:41,549
You need help.

1486
00:59:41,584 --> 00:59:42,583
Everybody needs help.

1487
00:59:42,618 --> 00:59:44,684
Yes, well, some more than others.

1488
00:59:58,684 --> 01:00:00,848
From the Buddha to the cross,

1489
01:00:00,883 --> 01:00:05,551
I have always imagined
both as entirely mythic -

1490
01:00:05,586 --> 01:00:07,949
but I would like to hear more.

1491
01:00:07,984 --> 01:00:10,650
May I lie on the couch for a moment?

1492
01:00:10,685 --> 01:00:13,317
I'm not as young as I used to be.

1493
01:00:16,017 --> 01:00:17,049
Ohh!

1494
01:00:19,184 --> 01:00:23,216
So, you were Jesus.

1495
01:00:23,251 --> 01:00:26,351
Well, perhaps somebody had to
be, for better or for worse.

1496
01:00:26,386 --> 01:00:28,082
The jury is still out.

1497
01:00:28,117 --> 01:00:31,115
When did you begin to
believe you were Jesus?

1498
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:34,251
When did you begin to believe
you were a psychiatrist?

1499
01:00:34,286 --> 01:00:37,349
Since I graduated Harvard medical school

1500
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:40,084
and finished my residency,
I've had that feeling.

1501
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:42,368
Oh, I sometimes dream about it.

1502
01:00:42,403 --> 01:00:44,583
Have you acted upon this belief?

1503
01:00:44,618 --> 01:00:46,984
I had a private practice for a while,

1504
01:00:47,019 --> 01:00:48,484
and then I taught.

1505
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:49,915
Nothing unusual -

1506
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:53,217
oh, until one day, I met a caveman

1507
01:00:53,252 --> 01:00:55,784
who thought he was Jesus.

1508
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:58,282
Do you find that unusual?

1509
01:00:58,317 --> 01:01:00,750
Very. I would stake my reputation

1510
01:01:00,785 --> 01:01:03,149
he is as sane as I am,

1511
01:01:03,184 --> 01:01:06,117
so why does he persist in such a story?

1512
01:01:06,152 --> 01:01:08,284
There must be a reason, though.

1513
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:10,184
Unless I imagined it all?

1514
01:01:10,219 --> 01:01:11,449
Is that possible?

1515
01:01:11,484 --> 01:01:13,317
I think you're as sane as he is.

1516
01:01:13,352 --> 01:01:15,067
Oh, God, I-

1517
01:01:15,102 --> 01:01:16,783
No.

1518
01:01:18,317 --> 01:01:21,251
Did you ever find it
prudent to worship yourself

1519
01:01:21,286 --> 01:01:23,050
rather than be thought a heretic?

1520
01:01:23,085 --> 01:01:24,282
That would be something.

1521
01:01:24,317 --> 01:01:26,850
Other times, Christianity
was considered heresy.

1522
01:01:26,885 --> 01:01:28,616
I had to pretend other faiths.

1523
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:32,718
And what does Jesus have
to say to those present

1524
01:01:32,753 --> 01:01:35,117
who find it difficult to believe in him?

1525
01:01:35,152 --> 01:01:37,783
Believe in what he tried to teach,

1526
01:01:37,818 --> 01:01:39,715
without rigmarole.

1527
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:42,433
Piety is not what the
lessons bring to people.

1528
01:01:42,468 --> 01:01:45,117
It's the mistake they
bring to the lessons.

1529
01:01:52,517 --> 01:01:55,251
Well, it's getting to be night.

1530
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:58,917
I still have stuff to carry

1531
01:01:58,952 --> 01:02:01,284
and a long drive.

1532
01:02:01,319 --> 01:02:02,815
I'll help.

1533
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:06,451
John, do you have
a destination in mind?

1534
01:02:07,817 --> 01:02:09,200
Never mind.

1535
01:02:09,235 --> 01:02:10,584
I won't ask.

1536
01:02:11,651 --> 01:02:12,651
Thank you.

1537
01:02:20,017 --> 01:02:22,848
Anyone mentally ill can imagine

1538
01:02:22,883 --> 01:02:25,850
a fantastic background,
even an entire life,

1539
01:02:25,885 --> 01:02:28,149
and sincerely believe it.

1540
01:02:28,184 --> 01:02:30,783
The man who thinks he is Napoleon

1541
01:02:30,818 --> 01:02:32,649
does believe it.

1542
01:02:32,684 --> 01:02:35,600
His true identity has taken a backseat

1543
01:02:35,635 --> 01:02:38,517
to his delusion and the need for it.

1544
01:02:38,552 --> 01:02:40,534
If that's the case with John,

1545
01:02:40,569 --> 01:02:42,517
there is a grave disorder.

1546
01:02:42,552 --> 01:02:44,949
Organized brilliantly.

1547
01:02:44,984 --> 01:02:47,049
He's got an answer for everything.

1548
01:02:47,084 --> 01:02:49,718
It might involve
rejection of his father,

1549
01:02:49,753 --> 01:02:51,401
of his entire early past,

1550
01:02:51,436 --> 01:02:53,015
replaced by this fantasy.

1551
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:55,150
He says he can't remember his father.

1552
01:02:55,185 --> 01:02:56,149
Precisely why?

1553
01:02:56,184 --> 01:02:57,750
You said he was sane.

1554
01:02:57,785 --> 01:02:59,050
Did I?

1555
01:03:00,484 --> 01:03:02,950
Do you think that perhaps our caveman

1556
01:03:02,985 --> 01:03:04,750
has a monkey on his back?

1557
01:03:04,785 --> 01:03:06,349
Drugs?

1558
01:03:06,384 --> 01:03:07,848
No, no, no, no.

1559
01:03:07,883 --> 01:03:10,284
I've done a lot of consulting
work with narcotics.

1560
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,401
I've seen people tripping, strung out--

1561
01:03:12,436 --> 01:03:14,484
Whatever's up with John, it isn't that.

1562
01:03:14,519 --> 01:03:16,368
I've looked for signs - none.

1563
01:03:16,403 --> 01:03:18,182
Could cavemen really talk?

1564
01:03:18,217 --> 01:03:20,618
We think that language
came into existence

1565
01:03:20,653 --> 01:03:21,882
60,000 years ago.

1566
01:03:21,917 --> 01:03:23,915
The structure of stone age culture

1567
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:26,217
is evidence of the
ability to communicate -

1568
01:03:26,252 --> 01:03:27,616
verbally.

1569
01:03:29,352 --> 01:03:31,484
Oh, shut up.

1570
01:03:40,651 --> 01:03:42,850
Maybe it'd be easier if I were.

1571
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:44,017
Crazy?

1572
01:03:45,284 --> 01:03:46,815
No.

1573
01:03:59,984 --> 01:04:02,715
That is fascinating, isn't it,

1574
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:05,883
a brave attempt to teach
Buddhism in the west.

1575
01:04:05,918 --> 01:04:07,601
It's no wonder he failed.

1576
01:04:07,636 --> 01:04:09,249
We're not ready for it.

1577
01:04:09,284 --> 01:04:11,718
You're talking
as if you believed him.

1578
01:04:11,753 --> 01:04:13,885
Well, it is possible, isn't it?

1579
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,901
I mean, anything is possible.

1580
01:04:15,936 --> 01:04:18,143
Look, we have two simple choices.

1581
01:04:18,178 --> 01:04:20,316
We can get all bent out of shape

1582
01:04:20,351 --> 01:04:22,718
intellectualizing or
bench-pressing logic,

1583
01:04:22,753 --> 01:04:25,351
or we can simply relax and enjoy it.

1584
01:04:25,386 --> 01:04:27,149
I can listen critically,

1585
01:04:27,184 --> 01:04:30,551
but I don't have to make
up my mind about anything.

1586
01:04:30,586 --> 01:04:32,015
But you think you do?

1587
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:34,783
Well, unfortunately, there's
no authorities on prehistory,

1588
01:04:34,818 --> 01:04:36,549
so we couldn't stop him there.

1589
01:04:36,584 --> 01:04:38,384
There are experts on the Bible.

1590
01:04:38,419 --> 01:04:39,982
Dream on.

1591
01:04:40,017 --> 01:04:42,316
Yeah, thus the lost years of Jesus.

1592
01:04:42,351 --> 01:04:45,015
He didn't exist until John put on a hat.

1593
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:49,084
I don't believe in angels and the
Nativity and the star in the east,

1594
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:52,217
but there are stories about
the childhood of Jesus.

1595
01:04:52,252 --> 01:04:54,616
History hates a vacuum.

1596
01:04:54,651 --> 01:04:57,217
Improvisation, some of it very sincere,

1597
01:04:57,252 --> 01:04:58,349
fills the gaps.

1598
01:04:58,384 --> 01:04:59,715
It would have been easy

1599
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:02,649
to falsify a past back then.

1600
01:05:02,684 --> 01:05:06,050
A few words, credulity...
time would do the rest.

1601
01:05:06,085 --> 01:05:08,182
Now you're talking as
if you believed him.

1602
01:05:08,217 --> 01:05:10,633
Well, look at the
popular myths surrounding

1603
01:05:10,668 --> 01:05:13,050
the Kennedy assassination
in a few short years.

1604
01:05:13,085 --> 01:05:16,084
You had, uh, conspiracy, mafia, CIA.

1605
01:05:16,119 --> 01:05:19,049
That's a mystique that'll never go away.

1606
01:05:19,084 --> 01:05:22,917
It's always been a small step
from a fallen leader to a god.

1607
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:25,783
I don't think anybody
will deify Kennedy.

1608
01:05:25,818 --> 01:05:27,750
We're more sophisticated than that.

1609
01:05:27,785 --> 01:05:29,284
We are?

1610
01:05:29,319 --> 01:05:30,917
We are.

1611
01:05:34,517 --> 01:05:36,783
Well, you're finally fulfilling

1612
01:05:36,818 --> 01:05:39,050
one prophecy about the millennium, John.

1613
01:05:39,085 --> 01:05:40,984
What's that?

1614
01:05:41,019 --> 01:05:42,883
Here you are again.

1615
01:05:52,451 --> 01:05:54,416
You like the fire, John.

1616
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:57,950
Everywhere I've lived,
I've had a fireplace.

1617
01:05:57,985 --> 01:06:00,451
Childhood fixation, I guess.

1618
01:06:02,117 --> 01:06:04,150
Helps me to feel secure.

1619
01:06:05,551 --> 01:06:07,618
There are predators out there.

1620
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:11,867
One thing I didn't pack...

1621
01:06:11,902 --> 01:06:13,684
I thought I might need it.

1622
01:06:20,917 --> 01:06:24,217
<i>Wouldn't Sacre du printemps
be more appropriate?</i>

1623
01:06:24,252 --> 01:06:25,284
What?

1624
01:06:26,917 --> 01:06:28,982
You've got...

1625
01:06:29,017 --> 01:06:32,184
four men of science
completely baffled, my friend.

1626
01:06:32,219 --> 01:06:34,748
We-We don't know what to make of you.

1627
01:06:34,783 --> 01:06:37,516
Did you know Voltaire
was the first to suggest

1628
01:06:37,551 --> 01:06:40,984
that the universe was created
by a gigantic explosion?

1629
01:06:41,019 --> 01:06:43,282
I think Paul would agree.

1630
01:06:43,317 --> 01:06:45,748
And then Goethe was the first to suggest

1631
01:06:45,783 --> 01:06:49,651
that spiral nebulae were
swirling masses of stars.

1632
01:06:49,686 --> 01:06:51,815
We now call them galaxies.

1633
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:54,549
It's kind of funny how
often new concepts of science

1634
01:06:54,584 --> 01:06:57,484
find their first tentative
forms of expression in the arts.

1635
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:01,634
So did Beethoven do physics on the side?

1636
01:07:01,669 --> 01:07:05,750
He spent most of his
time lying on the floor

1637
01:07:05,785 --> 01:07:07,449
in front of his legless piano

1638
01:07:07,484 --> 01:07:10,217
surrounded by orange
peels and apple cores.

1639
01:07:12,384 --> 01:07:15,184
Now we're on the floor
listening to Beethoven.

1640
01:07:16,451 --> 01:07:17,982
Full circle.

1641
01:07:18,017 --> 01:07:20,317
Did you have, um...

1642
01:07:21,417 --> 01:07:23,115
any religious beliefs,

1643
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:25,400
or did you give it much thought?

1644
01:07:25,435 --> 01:07:27,651
You can't get there with thought.

1645
01:07:27,686 --> 01:07:29,335
You have faith?

1646
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:30,949
In a lot of things.

1647
01:07:30,984 --> 01:07:34,050
Do you have faith in
the future of the race?

1648
01:07:34,085 --> 01:07:36,015
I've seen species come and go.

1649
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:38,117
Depends on their balance
with the environment.

1650
01:07:39,817 --> 01:07:41,517
We've made a mess of it.

1651
01:07:41,552 --> 01:07:43,234
There's still time,

1652
01:07:43,269 --> 01:07:44,882
if we use it well.

1653
01:07:44,917 --> 01:07:47,618
Christianity has been a worldwide belief

1654
01:07:47,653 --> 01:07:49,316
for 2,000 years.

1655
01:07:49,351 --> 01:07:51,551
How long did the Egyptians worship Isis

1656
01:07:51,586 --> 01:07:53,182
or the Sumerians Ishtar?

1657
01:07:53,217 --> 01:07:55,850
In India, sacred cows wandered freely

1658
01:07:55,885 --> 01:07:57,683
as reincarnated souls.

1659
01:07:57,718 --> 01:07:59,401
In a thousand years,
they'll be barbecued

1660
01:07:59,436 --> 01:08:01,084
and their souls will be in squirrels.

1661
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:02,451
You weren't Jesus!

1662
01:08:04,484 --> 01:08:05,684
Oh, Edith.

1663
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:11,251
If...it rains...
It won't.

1664
01:08:11,286 --> 01:08:12,635
How do you know that?

1665
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:13,984
I don't smell it.

1666
01:08:17,451 --> 01:08:18,417
Were you...

1667
01:08:19,684 --> 01:08:21,950
I guess... a medicine man?

1668
01:08:21,985 --> 01:08:24,182
I was a shaman a few times.

1669
01:08:24,217 --> 01:08:27,551
I revealed some truths
to eat a little better.

1670
01:08:27,586 --> 01:08:30,618
You think that's all
religion is about...

1671
01:08:30,653 --> 01:08:33,182
selling hope and survival?

1672
01:08:33,217 --> 01:08:35,767
The Old Testament sells fear and guilt.

1673
01:08:35,802 --> 01:08:38,292
The New Testament is
a good code of ethics,

1674
01:08:38,327 --> 01:08:40,783
put into my mouth by
poets and philosophers

1675
01:08:40,818 --> 01:08:42,884
that are much smarter than I am.

1676
01:08:42,919 --> 01:08:44,950
The message is never practiced.

1677
01:08:46,117 --> 01:08:47,750
Fairy tales build churches.

1678
01:08:48,817 --> 01:08:50,967
What about the name "Jesus"?

1679
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:53,117
Did you pull that out of a hat?

1680
01:08:53,152 --> 01:08:55,484
I called myself John.

1681
01:08:55,519 --> 01:08:57,782
I almost always do.

1682
01:08:57,817 --> 01:08:59,848
As tales of the resurrection spread,

1683
01:08:59,883 --> 01:09:02,651
<i>the name was confused
with the Hebrew "Yochanan,"</i>

1684
01:09:02,686 --> 01:09:04,501
Meaning "God is gracious."

1685
01:09:04,536 --> 01:09:06,282
My stay on Earth was seen

1686
01:09:06,317 --> 01:09:09,967
as divine proof of immortality.

1687
01:09:10,002 --> 01:09:13,618
That led to "God is salvation"

1688
01:09:13,653 --> 01:09:15,115
<i>or Hebrew "Yahshua,"</i>

1689
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:18,317
which in translation
became my proper name,

1690
01:09:18,352 --> 01:09:20,951
<i>changing to late Greek, "Iesous,"</i>

1691
01:09:20,986 --> 01:09:23,516
<i>then to late Latin, "Iesus,"</i>

1692
01:09:23,551 --> 01:09:26,149
and finally medieval Latin, "Jesus,"

1693
01:09:26,184 --> 01:09:29,150
and it was a wonder
to watch it all happen.

1694
01:09:29,185 --> 01:09:32,301
Then you didn't claim
to be the son of God?

1695
01:09:32,336 --> 01:09:35,382
Began as a schoolhouse
and ended as a temple.

1696
01:09:35,417 --> 01:09:38,984
I said I had a master that
was greater than myself.

1697
01:09:39,019 --> 01:09:41,001
I never said he was my father.

1698
01:09:41,036 --> 01:09:42,949
I wanted to teach what I learned.

1699
01:09:42,984 --> 01:09:45,049
I never claimed to be king of the Jews,

1700
01:09:45,084 --> 01:09:48,217
I never walked on water,
I never raised the dead.

1701
01:09:48,252 --> 01:09:51,551
I never spoke of divine
except in the sense

1702
01:09:51,586 --> 01:09:53,718
of human goodness on Earth.

1703
01:09:57,251 --> 01:10:00,850
No wise men came from the
east to worship at a manger.

1704
01:10:00,885 --> 01:10:02,982
I did do a little healing

1705
01:10:03,017 --> 01:10:04,850
with some eastern medicine I'd learned.

1706
01:10:07,651 --> 01:10:08,750
That's it.

1707
01:10:12,551 --> 01:10:14,434
The three wise men began as a myth

1708
01:10:14,469 --> 01:10:16,317
about the birth of the Buddha.

1709
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:25,017
John, I should be home,
uh, kissing my wife.

1710
01:10:27,217 --> 01:10:29,384
We're all here, trapped by your story...

1711
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:36,618
hoping for a...
revolution? I don't know.

1712
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:41,900
Are there any, uh...

1713
01:10:41,935 --> 01:10:43,850
more revelations for us?

1714
01:10:50,317 --> 01:10:52,217
It's just like old times.

1715
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:00,817
You weren't Jesus.

1716
01:11:03,718 --> 01:11:06,017
Quote the sermon on the mount.

1717
01:11:06,052 --> 01:11:07,316
Which one?

1718
01:11:07,351 --> 01:11:10,551
Darby, King James,
new American standard?

1719
01:11:10,586 --> 01:11:12,416
Do you know them all?

1720
01:11:12,451 --> 01:11:15,618
No one knows the one, not even me.

1721
01:11:15,653 --> 01:11:16,949
I...

1722
01:11:16,984 --> 01:11:19,284
I did some teaching on a hill one day.

1723
01:11:19,319 --> 01:11:21,351
Not that many people stayed.

1724
01:11:21,386 --> 01:11:22,482
But you...

1725
01:11:22,517 --> 01:11:24,516
Biblical Jesus said,

1726
01:11:24,551 --> 01:11:26,984
"Who do you think I am?"

1727
01:11:27,019 --> 01:11:29,417
He gave them a choice.

1728
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:32,317
I'm giving you one.

1729
01:11:35,284 --> 01:11:36,651
Were you?

1730
01:11:38,651 --> 01:11:41,284
If I said no, could you ever be sure?

1731
01:11:58,451 --> 01:12:00,384
Turn that off.

1732
01:12:00,419 --> 01:12:01,351
Please.

1733
01:12:04,451 --> 01:12:06,467
This has gone far enough.

1734
01:12:06,502 --> 01:12:08,449
It's gone much too far.

1735
01:12:08,484 --> 01:12:11,034
These people are very upset.

1736
01:12:11,069 --> 01:12:13,549
I don't believe you're mad,

1737
01:12:13,584 --> 01:12:15,883
But what you're saying is not true.

1738
01:12:16,984 --> 01:12:19,817
That leaves only one explanation.

1739
01:12:20,984 --> 01:12:23,084
The time has come when you must admit

1740
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:24,284
this is a hoax...

1741
01:12:25,984 --> 01:12:27,249
A lie.

1742
01:12:27,284 --> 01:12:30,915
Isn't that true, John?

1743
01:12:30,950 --> 01:12:33,718
If you don't drop this now
- If you can -

1744
01:12:33,753 --> 01:12:35,249
I'll be convinced

1745
01:12:35,284 --> 01:12:38,234
that you need a great deal of attention.

1746
01:12:38,269 --> 01:12:41,184
I can have you committed
for observation.

1747
01:12:41,219 --> 01:12:42,851
You know that.

1748
01:12:42,886 --> 01:12:44,802
I ask you now

1749
01:12:44,837 --> 01:12:46,683
- I demand it -

1750
01:12:46,718 --> 01:12:49,783
that you tell these people the truth.

1751
01:12:49,818 --> 01:12:53,067
Give them closure.

1752
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:56,317
It's time, John.

1753
01:12:56,352 --> 01:12:57,517
Please.

1754
01:13:11,184 --> 01:13:13,950
End of the line. Everybody off.

1755
01:13:17,217 --> 01:13:19,182
What?!

1756
01:13:19,217 --> 01:13:21,350
It was a story.

1757
01:13:21,385 --> 01:13:23,484
It was all a story.

1758
01:13:24,503 --> 01:13:25,417
Good God!

1759
01:13:27,217 --> 01:13:29,000
Another fairy tale?

1760
01:13:29,035 --> 01:13:30,748
All of it? But what--?

1761
01:13:30,783 --> 01:13:32,149
What in the name of heaven...?

1762
01:13:32,184 --> 01:13:34,417
John, you had us wondering
whether you were sane or not,

1763
01:13:34,452 --> 01:13:36,015
and it's just a story!

1764
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:39,351
Where'd you come off with such
a half-baked, asinine idea?

1765
01:13:39,386 --> 01:13:41,150
At least you're relieved I'm not a nut.

1766
01:13:41,185 --> 01:13:42,818
I'd prefer you were!

1767
01:13:42,853 --> 01:13:44,451
You gave me the idea.

1768
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:45,851
All of you.

1769
01:13:45,886 --> 01:13:47,182
Come again?

1770
01:13:47,217 --> 01:13:48,784
Edith saw my fake Van Gogh.

1771
01:13:48,819 --> 01:13:50,235
You could have just told me.

1772
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:51,860
You commented that I never age.

1773
01:13:51,895 --> 01:13:53,451
You gave me the book on early man.

1774
01:13:53,486 --> 01:13:55,049
Dan, you spotted the burin

1775
01:13:55,084 --> 01:13:56,750
and you said, "if stones could speak."

1776
01:13:56,785 --> 01:13:58,382
I knew it.

1777
01:13:58,417 --> 01:14:00,848
I got the notion, I ran it past you

1778
01:14:00,883 --> 01:14:03,451
to check your reactions,
and I took it too far.

1779
01:14:03,486 --> 01:14:04,815
Too far?

1780
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:06,316
Check my reaction.

1781
01:14:06,351 --> 01:14:08,917
You asked if I was a figure
from religious history,

1782
01:14:08,952 --> 01:14:10,434
if there were others like me,

1783
01:14:10,469 --> 01:14:11,882
if I'd created future identities.

1784
01:14:11,917 --> 01:14:15,067
We were chasing our
tails around the maypole,

1785
01:14:15,102 --> 01:14:18,217
enjoying the mystery,
the analytical stretch.

1786
01:14:18,252 --> 01:14:20,150
You were playing my game!

1787
01:14:20,185 --> 01:14:21,715
I was playing yours.

1788
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:24,351
Oh, man, you know,
you had us going, right?

1789
01:14:24,386 --> 01:14:25,583
You were good, man.

1790
01:14:25,618 --> 01:14:27,082
You know those Chinese boxes,

1791
01:14:27,117 --> 01:14:30,184
one inside the other inside
the other inside the other?

1792
01:14:30,219 --> 01:14:33,251
I feel like I'm in the last box.

1793
01:14:33,286 --> 01:14:35,551
You son of a...

1794
01:14:35,586 --> 01:14:36,583
bitch!

1795
01:14:36,618 --> 01:14:38,150
How could you do this to us?

1796
01:14:38,185 --> 01:14:40,216
I was worried about you.

1797
01:14:40,251 --> 01:14:42,600
I know, I was tempted
to cop out many times,

1798
01:14:42,635 --> 01:14:44,950
But I couldn't resist
seeing whether or not

1799
01:14:44,985 --> 01:14:46,718
you could refute what I was saying.

1800
01:14:46,753 --> 01:14:48,652
I had the perfect audience.

1801
01:14:48,687 --> 01:14:50,551
Anthropologist, archaeologist,

1802
01:14:50,586 --> 01:14:52,651
Christian literalist...

1803
01:14:52,686 --> 01:14:54,815
a psychologist.

1804
01:14:54,850 --> 01:14:56,915
Okay, I've had enough of this.

1805
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:59,017
I'm outta here.
You wanna come? Let's go.

1806
01:15:00,150 --> 01:15:01,382
So, John.

1807
01:15:01,417 --> 01:15:03,017
Are you gonna write the story?

1808
01:15:03,052 --> 01:15:04,651
If I do, I'll send you copies.

1809
01:15:04,686 --> 01:15:06,901
Don't bother with mine, okay?

1810
01:15:06,936 --> 01:15:09,117
You are absolutely certifiable.

1811
01:15:09,152 --> 01:15:10,850
I don't know you!

1812
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:15,551
It was nice seeing
you again, Dr. Oldman.

1813
01:15:16,984 --> 01:15:18,783
Your name's a pun, isn't it?

1814
01:15:18,818 --> 01:15:19,783
Old man?

1815
01:15:21,651 --> 01:15:24,251
Did that help you with your story?

1816
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:25,883
Linda!

1817
01:15:27,517 --> 01:15:28,584
Bye.

1818
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:33,984
Well, Art was half right.

1819
01:15:35,553 --> 01:15:37,017
Which half?

1820
01:15:39,817 --> 01:15:42,817
Well, at least I don't
have to throw away half

1821
01:15:42,852 --> 01:15:44,618
of what I know about biology.

1822
01:15:44,653 --> 01:15:46,251
Which half?

1823
01:15:47,850 --> 01:15:49,915
It's a beautiful idea,

1824
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:53,817
so rich, so full of possibilities.

1825
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:57,184
Perhaps you should write
a paper on it, doctor.

1826
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:58,915
Maybe I will.

1827
01:15:58,950 --> 01:16:01,117
I'll interview you in the rubber room

1828
01:16:01,152 --> 01:16:02,616
for further details.

1829
01:16:02,651 --> 01:16:04,684
You may still need help, my friend.

1830
01:16:18,217 --> 01:16:19,649
My ass.

1831
01:16:19,684 --> 01:16:21,848
I thought it sounded pretty good.

1832
01:16:21,883 --> 01:16:23,950
They believe you because they have to.

1833
01:16:23,985 --> 01:16:26,017
But the one thing that I know about you

1834
01:16:26,052 --> 01:16:27,583
is that you would never use people

1835
01:16:27,618 --> 01:16:29,351
or abuse their goodwill and intelligence

1836
01:16:29,386 --> 01:16:31,084
like they think you've
just done to them.

1837
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:32,216
Psych 101?

1838
01:16:32,251 --> 01:16:34,815
No, it's woman,
one-on-one.

1839
01:16:34,850 --> 01:16:37,633
So you're a pretty fast liar, Mr. Ugg,

1840
01:16:37,668 --> 01:16:40,382
But I wanna know:
What's your real name?

1841
01:16:40,417 --> 01:16:45,351
Believe it or not, the
sound was always John.

1842
01:16:45,386 --> 01:16:47,285
Why'd you cave to Gruber?

1843
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:48,952
What happened was enough.

1844
01:16:48,987 --> 01:16:50,549
Just- just needed to stop.

1845
01:16:50,584 --> 01:16:52,750
I shouldn't have expected it to work.

1846
01:16:54,150 --> 01:16:56,100
Fourteen thousand years old.

1847
01:16:56,135 --> 01:16:58,050
I bet that's a lot of women.

1848
01:16:58,085 --> 01:17:00,050
Are we counting?

1849
01:17:00,085 --> 01:17:01,417
Maybe.

1850
01:17:03,384 --> 01:17:05,451
Well, I'm taking Edith home.

1851
01:17:05,486 --> 01:17:06,384
Sandy?

1852
01:17:07,783 --> 01:17:09,317
I'm gonna stay.

1853
01:17:13,317 --> 01:17:16,050
Are you sorry for some
of those things you said?

1854
01:17:16,085 --> 01:17:18,618
I'm sorry I said them.

1855
01:17:18,653 --> 01:17:20,082
Well.

1856
01:17:20,117 --> 01:17:21,584
Like a good Christian,

1857
01:17:21,619 --> 01:17:24,783
I... oh, John.

1858
01:17:24,818 --> 01:17:26,584
Oh! Well.

1859
01:17:27,783 --> 01:17:30,015
You did a terrible thing,

1860
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:32,449
but we're all so
thankful you're all right.

1861
01:17:32,484 --> 01:17:35,551
Even Art. He just hates
things he can't understand.

1862
01:17:35,586 --> 01:17:37,349
You're a sadist, John,

1863
01:17:37,384 --> 01:17:39,482
But I admit I got a kick out of

1864
01:17:39,517 --> 01:17:41,251
chasing my tail around your maypole...

1865
01:17:41,286 --> 01:17:43,451
Even if that is all I caught.

1866
01:17:43,486 --> 01:17:44,616
Good luck to you.

1867
01:17:44,651 --> 01:17:46,217
Wish you the best. Thank you.

1868
01:17:46,252 --> 01:17:47,251
Ready?

1869
01:17:56,284 --> 01:17:58,150
Later on.
Okay, good night.

1870
01:18:00,984 --> 01:18:01,917
Mm-hmm.

1871
01:18:05,317 --> 01:18:06,549
Mmm.

1872
01:18:06,584 --> 01:18:09,482
I don't know, man.

1873
01:18:09,517 --> 01:18:11,484
Something about this...

1874
01:18:11,519 --> 01:18:13,768
something about you, John.

1875
01:18:13,803 --> 01:18:15,982
The more I think about it,

1876
01:18:16,017 --> 01:18:18,883
the more I'm no longer
in that Chinese box.

1877
01:18:20,819 --> 01:18:22,616
I sense... space.

1878
01:18:22,651 --> 01:18:27,551
A kinda latitude of what
we happily call reality,

1879
01:18:27,586 --> 01:18:30,618
in which, as everybody keeps saying...

1880
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:33,683
anything's possible.

1881
01:18:33,718 --> 01:18:35,584
Yes. No, no. No, no.

1882
01:18:35,619 --> 01:18:37,418
No. No more words.

1883
01:18:37,453 --> 01:18:39,182
I'm gonna go home,

1884
01:18:39,217 --> 01:18:41,017
<i>and I'm gonna watch Star Trek</i>

1885
01:18:41,052 --> 01:18:43,134
for a dose of sanity.

1886
01:18:43,169 --> 01:18:45,182
Good luck to you, man,

1887
01:18:45,217 --> 01:18:47,633
wherever this may lead you.

1888
01:18:47,668 --> 01:18:50,015
You drop me a line sometime.

1889
01:18:50,050 --> 01:18:51,883
Let me know how you're making out.

1890
01:18:53,451 --> 01:18:54,417
I will.

1891
01:19:05,917 --> 01:19:08,782
So, John Oldman.

1892
01:19:08,817 --> 01:19:11,384
What other pun names have you used?

1893
01:19:11,419 --> 01:19:12,718
Lots.

1894
01:19:14,251 --> 01:19:17,317
John Paley for John Paleolithic,

1895
01:19:17,352 --> 01:19:19,715
John Savage...

1896
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:21,850
Got really crazy about 60 years ago,

1897
01:19:21,885 --> 01:19:23,718
when I was teaching at Harvard,

1898
01:19:23,753 --> 01:19:26,549
I was John Thomas Partee.

1899
01:19:26,584 --> 01:19:29,117
John T. Partee -
Boston tea party.

1900
01:19:29,152 --> 01:19:30,334
I get it.

1901
01:19:30,369 --> 01:19:31,576
Yeah, I know.

1902
01:19:31,611 --> 01:19:32,783
Wait, wait, wait.

1903
01:19:32,818 --> 01:19:35,115
Boston?

1904
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:37,283
60 years ago?

1905
01:19:37,318 --> 01:19:39,417
J-John Partee?

1906
01:19:43,317 --> 01:19:47,883
You did not teach chemistry!
I do not believe you!

1907
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:51,718
Your mother's name was Nola.

1908
01:19:51,753 --> 01:19:52,950
No. Yeah.

1909
01:19:52,985 --> 01:19:55,015
No.

1910
01:19:55,050 --> 01:19:57,516
Yes, Nola.

1911
01:19:57,551 --> 01:19:59,184
My mother!

1912
01:20:00,551 --> 01:20:02,150
I reject this!

1913
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:05,750
My-My-My dog's name.

1914
01:20:06,850 --> 01:20:08,750
We had him before I was born.

1915
01:20:08,785 --> 01:20:09,782
Woofie.

1916
01:20:09,817 --> 01:20:11,150
Woof, woof, woofie...

1917
01:20:16,651 --> 01:20:18,601
Gruber. She remarried?

1918
01:20:18,636 --> 01:20:20,551
She said you abandoned us.

1919
01:20:21,618 --> 01:20:23,282
Sorry, I had to move on.

1920
01:20:23,317 --> 01:20:25,050
You know that. I left enough.

1921
01:20:25,085 --> 01:20:27,234
- I left enough.
- I'm cold.

1922
01:20:27,269 --> 01:20:29,360
Chilly Willy, always cold.

1923
01:20:29,395 --> 01:20:31,416
Never could stand the cold.

1924
01:20:31,451 --> 01:20:35,150
Wait, you-- you had a beard.

1925
01:20:35,185 --> 01:20:36,817
Yeah, you used to tug on it

1926
01:20:36,852 --> 01:20:38,384
to see if it was real.

1927
01:20:38,419 --> 01:20:39,950
Agh! Will!

1928
01:20:39,985 --> 01:20:40,883
God.

1929
01:20:42,317 --> 01:20:43,748
911, now!

1930
01:20:45,685 --> 01:20:47,517
Come on, Will.

1931
01:20:47,552 --> 01:20:48,683
Will.

1932
01:20:48,718 --> 01:20:49,651
Come on, buddy.

1933
01:21:21,850 --> 01:21:23,933
You'll stay in touch, Dr. Oldman,

1934
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:26,076
in case there are any questions.

1935
01:21:26,111 --> 01:21:28,184
I'll be back for the funeral.

1936
01:21:28,219 --> 01:21:29,217
Miss.

1937
01:21:39,484 --> 01:21:41,651
You never saw a grown child die.

1938
01:21:43,117 --> 01:21:44,050
No.
