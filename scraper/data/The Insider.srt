2
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:36,698
- Coffee?
- Yeah, thank you.

3
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:41,870
How have you liked
your stay?

4
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:44,582
What I've seen, I've liked.

5
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,298
Please to explain why
l should agree to interview...

6
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:54,926
with pro-Zionist
American media?

7
00:03:56,594 --> 00:03:58,596
Because I think
Hezbollah...

8
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:03,270
is trying to broaden into
a political party right now,

9
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:05,981
so you care about what
you're thought of in America,

10
00:04:06,064 --> 00:04:08,942
and in America
at this moment in time,

11
00:04:08,984 --> 00:04:11,987
Hezbollah does not
have a face.

12
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:16,199
- That's why.
- Perhaps you approve journalism objectivity,

13
00:04:16,283 --> 00:04:18,201
and I see
the questions first.

14
00:04:18,285 --> 00:04:21,038
Then I decide if l grant
the interview.

15
00:04:21,122 --> 00:04:23,582
No.
We don't do that.

16
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,961
You've seen 60 Minutes
and Mike Wallace,

17
00:04:27,044 --> 00:04:30,298
so you know our reputation
for integrity and objectivity.

18
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:34,760
You also know we are
the highest-rated, most-respected...

19
00:04:34,844 --> 00:04:38,265
TV magazine news show
in America.

20
00:04:46,106 --> 00:04:49,443
So, Mr. Wallace...
Should he get on a plane or not?

21
00:04:51,278 --> 00:04:54,449
Tell him I'll see him
day after tomorrow.

22
00:04:54,532 --> 00:04:56,785
That's good.
That works.

23
00:04:59,538 --> 00:05:04,335
You know, I want to ask you something.
I know it sounds odd, but...

24
00:05:09,006 --> 00:05:10,924
Hello? Sheikh?

25
00:05:14,554 --> 00:05:17,140
Hello? Sheikh?

26
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:26,358
- Norman?
- What? What?

27
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,777
Take your blindfold off.

28
00:05:34,158 --> 00:05:37,286
Welcome to the world.

29
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,379
Fluctuating
all over the place.

30
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,842
Anywhere we shoot here, it's gonna
be portable gennies and we'll run cable.

31
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:02,021
- Hello?
- Mike, it's me.

32
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:04,899
We're on.

33
00:07:53,684 --> 00:07:56,979
Hi, honey.

34
00:07:57,062 --> 00:07:59,398
- Hi, Daddy.
- What's new?

35
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:03,485
- Miss Loughrey gave me a star today.
- Yeah? What for?

36
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:06,613
- For reading.
- That's great.

37
00:08:14,163 --> 00:08:17,125
A little early for cartoons,
isn't it?

38
00:08:18,293 --> 00:08:20,963
Okay.

39
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:29,306
Deborah? Debbie?

40
00:08:38,565 --> 00:08:41,067
Oh, I didn't know
you were home.

41
00:08:41,151 --> 00:08:44,487
It's early,
isn't it?

42
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:47,658
Gotta take Debbie to ballet.

43
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:51,829
Mommy!

44
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,088
Sweetheart, come on.
Come on.

45
00:09:01,172 --> 00:09:04,009
- She was playing
with my Pooh doll again.

46
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:07,846
Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.
Breathe deep. Breathe deep.

47
00:09:10,057 --> 00:09:11,893
Slow down, honey. Slow down.

48
00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:14,812
Slow down.

49
00:09:14,896 --> 00:09:18,024
Here we go.
Deep breaths.

50
00:09:18,107 --> 00:09:20,568
- Deep breaths.
- She was playing with the Pooh doll.

51
00:09:20,652 --> 00:09:24,907
Pooh's dusty, sweetheart.
He's dusty, and you breathed him in.

52
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:27,034
Okay? So, what's happening to you...
Look at me.

53
00:09:27,117 --> 00:09:29,828
What's happening to you now
is cells called mass cells...

54
00:09:29,912 --> 00:09:33,999
told your lungs, " Don't breathe
any more of that dust in."

55
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,543
And the airways in your lungs
are like branches,

56
00:09:36,627 --> 00:09:40,548
and when the branches close up,
you get an asthmatic attack,

57
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,426
and we give you medicine,
and you get better.

58
00:09:43,468 --> 00:09:45,929
Uh-huh? Okay?

59
00:09:46,012 --> 00:09:47,931
Better already,
aren't you?

60
00:09:55,939 --> 00:09:57,858
Okay, baby?

61
00:10:06,493 --> 00:10:08,870
Can I go to dance tomorrow?
L-l'm better.

62
00:10:08,954 --> 00:10:12,582
If you are, then I'll take Barbara
to soccer and take you to dance after.

63
00:10:12,624 --> 00:10:15,128
I can take her.

64
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:18,715
Don't you have to
be at the office?

65
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:22,260
- Is there any more rice?
- Yes, it's on the stove.

66
00:10:25,847 --> 00:10:27,807
Do you want more rice?

67
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,393
- May be later.
- How about you?

68
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:32,396
- l'll take some.
- Instant rice?

69
00:10:38,235 --> 00:10:40,195
Can l go ower to Jeanine's house?

70
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:44,700
- I'm sorry, darling. Have you seen my coffee mug?
- Try the car.

71
00:11:06,641 --> 00:11:10,145
Um, what are
those boxes?

72
00:11:10,228 --> 00:11:13,231
- I'm going to the store. You need anything?
- What do you need at the store?

73
00:11:13,315 --> 00:11:15,400
- Soy sauce.
- Right now?

74
00:11:15,484 --> 00:11:17,402
That's my stuff
from the office.

75
00:11:17,486 --> 00:11:20,072
Why did you take
your stuff from the office?

76
00:11:20,155 --> 00:11:22,866
- I didn't want to leave it there.
- I don't understand.

77
00:11:26,496 --> 00:11:29,624
I got fired
this morning.

78
00:11:29,707 --> 00:11:32,710
Where else am I
gonna take it?

79
00:11:32,794 --> 00:11:36,214
Why?
Who said?

80
00:11:36,297 --> 00:11:38,216
Thomas Sandefur.

81
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,309
What are we
supposed to do?

82
00:11:46,393 --> 00:11:50,146
What about our medical coverage?
What about our health?

83
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,943
What about our... car payments?
The payments on this house?

84
00:12:03,202 --> 00:12:05,705
The severance agreement
includes cash payoffs over time...

85
00:12:05,788 --> 00:12:08,582
and continuing
medical coverage.

86
00:12:08,624 --> 00:12:11,085
Sure you don't need anything?

87
00:12:11,168 --> 00:12:13,421
No, thank you.

88
00:12:21,263 --> 00:12:23,974
Jeffrey?

89
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,998
I am very pleased to receive you
as my guest, Mr. Wallace.

90
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:50,210
- Well, thank you for having us.
- Think l got a problem with the gennie.

91
00:12:50,252 --> 00:12:52,212
I gotta go outside.

92
00:12:55,216 --> 00:12:57,052
Give me a hand with this,
will you?

93
00:13:00,096 --> 00:13:02,098
Norman!

94
00:13:05,644 --> 00:13:08,855
- He says, uh, you must not sit so close.
- What?

95
00:13:10,315 --> 00:13:12,610
I can't conduct an interview
from back there.

96
00:13:16,322 --> 00:13:19,784
You must move back
your chair.

97
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:22,495
Well, you tell him that when
I conduct an interview,

98
00:13:22,578 --> 00:13:25,748
I sit anywhere
I damn please.

99
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:35,385
- There is no interview.
- You!

100
00:13:35,468 --> 00:13:40,598
I'm talking to you! What the hell do
you think I am, a 78-year-old assassin?

101
00:13:40,682 --> 00:13:44,060
You think I'm gonna karate him
to death with this notepad?

102
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,070
- Are you interpreting what I'm saying?
- Yes.

103
00:13:53,153 --> 00:13:56,949
- We're there.
- Good. Well, ask him if Arabic is his second language.

104
00:13:56,991 --> 00:13:59,243
Don't interpret that. Hold it.

105
00:13:59,326 --> 00:14:01,870
Hold it! Hold it!
Slow. Slow.

106
00:14:01,954 --> 00:14:04,623
Sheikh, do you mind?

107
00:14:04,665 --> 00:14:07,460
If you would just turn
your chair a little bit...

108
00:14:07,502 --> 00:14:10,213
to face Mr. Wallace.

109
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,884
- Is that okay?
- Okay.

110
00:14:16,511 --> 00:14:19,222
Are you ready, or do you
wanna keep fucking around...

111
00:14:19,306 --> 00:14:21,225
and warm up some more?

112
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:24,438
- No. I've got my heart started.
- Okay.

113
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:28,066
All right, Todd.

114
00:14:29,192 --> 00:14:31,820
Give me the three-button
on Mike, please.

115
00:14:32,904 --> 00:14:36,491
Good. Good.

116
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:39,828
Okay, we are rolling.

117
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,668
- Okay, Mike.
- Sheikh Fadlallah.

118
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:48,838
Thank you so much for seeing us.
Are you a terrorist?

119
00:14:50,214 --> 00:14:54,135
Mr. Wallace, I am
a servant of God.

120
00:14:54,218 --> 00:14:57,305
A servant of God?
Really?

121
00:14:57,388 --> 00:15:00,726
Americans believe that you...
As an lslamic fundamentalist...

122
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:06,482
that you are a leader who contributed
to the bombing of the U.S. Embassy.

123
00:15:27,755 --> 00:15:33,135
Everybody thinks Canadian Mounties ride
horses and rescue ladies from rapids.

124
00:15:33,219 --> 00:15:36,556
Mike, they backed locals
in Oka in a fight with Mohawks...

125
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,101
over building a golf course
on their burial site,

126
00:15:39,142 --> 00:15:41,853
they beat up protesters at Kanasake...

127
00:15:44,314 --> 00:15:46,274
- Where'd you hear that?
- Hello.

128
00:15:46,316 --> 00:15:50,195
Oh, someone took a poll?
"Are all things Canadian boring?"

129
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:52,573
- It's Stuart. He's in Mexico City.
- Oh. Let me call you back.

130
00:15:53,616 --> 00:15:55,994
Yeah, Stuart?

131
00:15:56,077 --> 00:15:58,830
- What New York bank?
- Hey, Dad.

132
00:15:58,913 --> 00:16:02,083
Will he go on camera and talk
about the Mexico City branch?

133
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,294
- Hey, Jake.
- Whose money are they laundering?

134
00:16:04,378 --> 00:16:07,589
- No classes this morning?
- I don't have to be there till 1 0:30.

135
00:16:07,631 --> 00:16:11,177
- Hey, Mom. Hello.
- Hi, sweetheart.

136
00:16:15,223 --> 00:16:17,851
- Hello? Yeah.
- Do independent sources corroborate?

137
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:25,525
- Dad, you got a box out here.
- Let me see this a second.

138
00:16:25,608 --> 00:16:29,238
- 'Cause I gotta know where
you're going at all times.

139
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,794
I can't. I've gotta fly
to Boston tomorrow.

140
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,173
2:00 P.M. Great.

141
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:50,010
- Bye-bye.
- "ignition propensity."

142
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,471
You understand
any of this?

143
00:16:55,975 --> 00:16:58,019
No.

144
00:16:59,187 --> 00:17:01,981
Uh, this looks like
a table of temperatures.

145
00:17:02,065 --> 00:17:05,611
- Who's this from?
- It's anonymous.

146
00:17:05,694 --> 00:17:08,238
References to " P.M."

147
00:17:08,322 --> 00:17:10,324
It's gotta be
Phillip Morris, huh?

148
00:17:10,407 --> 00:17:13,285
Hmm. I have to
take a shower.

149
00:17:30,553 --> 00:17:33,807
Yeah?

150
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,850
Hi. This is
Doug Oliver.

151
00:17:35,892 --> 00:17:38,019
Oh, hi, Doug.
It's Lowell.

152
00:17:38,103 --> 00:17:41,774
I'm doing this story on fire safety, and
people burning up from falling asleep smoking.

153
00:17:41,857 --> 00:17:46,320
I receive a shit load of scientific
papers from inside Phillip Morris.

154
00:17:46,404 --> 00:17:49,533
Anonymous. You or anybody
in F.D.A. Know someone...

155
00:17:49,616 --> 00:17:52,327
who can translate this stuff
into English for me?

156
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:54,538
Uh, yeah.

157
00:18:11,014 --> 00:18:14,560
- Hello?
- Uh, Mr. Wigand, please?

158
00:18:14,643 --> 00:18:18,647
Someone's calling
for Daddy, Mom.

159
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:24,069
- Oh. Thank you, Bob.
- Who's calling?

160
00:18:24,153 --> 00:18:26,322
Uh, my name
is Lowell Bergman.

161
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:31,118
- Did you say " Berman"?
- No, Bergman. B-E-R-G-M-A-N.

162
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,705
- I'm a producer for 60 Minutes.
- 60 Minutes?

163
00:18:33,788 --> 00:18:36,750
- Yeah.
- 60 Minutes, the television show?

164
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:40,212
- Yes.
- He doesn't want to talk to you.

165
00:18:42,465 --> 00:18:45,217
How does he know he doesn't want to talk to
me? He doesn't know what I'm calling him about.

166
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:47,845
He doesn't care to know.

167
00:19:09,952 --> 00:19:13,122
This is the Wigands'.

168
00:19:13,206 --> 00:19:16,668
- If you'd like to leave a message
or send a fax, start now.

169
00:19:16,751 --> 00:19:19,712
This is Lowell Bergman with 60 Minutes,
and l'm doing a story...

170
00:19:19,796 --> 00:19:21,839
on fire safety
and cigarettes.

171
00:19:21,923 --> 00:19:25,009
I have scientific documents
from a tobacco company,

172
00:19:25,093 --> 00:19:27,846
and lcould use your help
as a consultant...

173
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,890
explaining these documents
tome.

174
00:19:29,932 --> 00:19:35,855
Now, my number is
area code 510-555-0199.

175
00:19:35,897 --> 00:19:40,694
- I'll be there at this number
in ten minutes.

176
00:22:09,187 --> 00:22:12,232
If you're curious
to meet me,

177
00:22:12,315 --> 00:22:17,279
I'm gonna be in the lobby
of the Seelbach Hotel in Louisville...

178
00:22:17,362 --> 00:22:21,366
reading The New York Times
tomorrow at 5:00.

179
00:23:39,992 --> 00:23:42,620
Have you always lived in Louiswille?

180
00:23:42,662 --> 00:23:46,791
Mr. Bergman, what did you
want me to consult about?

181
00:23:46,874 --> 00:23:50,421
Who's that?

182
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:55,343
That's room service.

183
00:23:55,427 --> 00:23:58,179
They usually
knock first.

184
00:23:58,263 --> 00:24:00,473
Come on in.

185
00:24:00,515 --> 00:24:02,600
Over here, please.

186
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:15,948
- Thank you.
- How do you like your coffee? Black?

187
00:24:16,032 --> 00:24:18,993
Black. Black.

188
00:24:19,076 --> 00:24:22,121
I really don't have that much time.

189
00:24:24,373 --> 00:24:27,001
Is there anything you want to know
about me, Mr. Wigand?

190
00:24:27,084 --> 00:24:29,212
Like what?
Your sign?

191
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:34,634
I know what I
have to know.

192
00:24:34,718 --> 00:24:38,513
Just so I know you know,
when I talk to people in confidence,

193
00:24:38,555 --> 00:24:40,516
it stays that way.

194
00:24:42,935 --> 00:24:46,857
How did a radical journalist
from Ramparts magazine end up at CBS?

195
00:24:49,693 --> 00:24:52,154
I still do
the tough stories.

196
00:24:52,237 --> 00:24:54,615
60 Minutes reaches
a lot of people.

197
00:24:56,784 --> 00:24:58,994
Let me see
the documents.

198
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:29,360
This is a, um,

199
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:33,323
fire-safety product study
for Phillip Morris.

200
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:37,369
Burn rates, ignition propensity,
things of this nature.

201
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:40,289
I could very easily explain this
to you in layman's terms...

202
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,291
because it's from
another company.

203
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:46,129
- But that's as far as I go.
- As far as you go where?

204
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:49,132
This issue is
a drop in the bucket.

205
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,217
I can talk to you
about what's in here, but l...

206
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,928
I can't talk to you
about anything else.

207
00:25:58,058 --> 00:26:01,270
I signed a confidentiality agreement.
I honor agreements.

208
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:07,735
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality
agreements, Mr. Bergman?

209
00:26:07,818 --> 00:26:11,655
Between journalists and management,
yes, I believe they do.

210
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:15,076
But I don't take that seriously.
Where do you work?

211
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,078
Did work.

212
00:26:17,162 --> 00:26:21,291
- Did work?
- How much would I get paid?

213
00:26:24,628 --> 00:26:28,090
That you have to discuss
with CBS Business Affairs.

214
00:26:28,174 --> 00:26:32,804
But for something like this, I would
say anywhere between ten, 1 2 thousand.

215
00:26:36,767 --> 00:26:38,852
Should I just take
the documents now?

216
00:26:40,103 --> 00:26:42,606
If you want to do it.

217
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,949
I worked as a, uh,

218
00:26:52,033 --> 00:26:54,911
head of Research and Development
for Brown &Williamson.

219
00:26:54,994 --> 00:26:57,455
Tobacco company.

220
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:03,461
I was a corporate
vice president.

221
00:27:04,921 --> 00:27:07,298
Mr. Bergman.

222
00:27:34,745 --> 00:27:36,706
President Assad of Syria said...

223
00:27:36,747 --> 00:27:39,917
that difficult obstacles remain,
but tha this country,

224
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,423
"looks forward to a great long peace
with lsrael."

225
00:27:44,506 --> 00:27:47,008
That's a Peabody, Mike.

226
00:27:47,092 --> 00:27:50,178
When you're dead and buried, this is
the one they're gonna remember you by.

227
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:54,641
- Are you eating with us?
- Yeah.

228
00:27:54,725 --> 00:27:58,437
- Bring a tie so they let us
in the front door.

229
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,605
Come on.

230
00:28:07,865 --> 00:28:10,534
- Debbie!
- Hey, Lowell.

231
00:28:10,576 --> 00:28:13,412
Oh, Bill. Main Justice is investigating
a major New York bank...

232
00:28:13,454 --> 00:28:15,914
Iaundering narco dollars
out of their Mexico City branch.

233
00:28:15,998 --> 00:28:18,042
- You want it for the news?
- What about you? You got a crew already?

234
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:21,129
- I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Catch you later. - Okay.

235
00:28:26,217 --> 00:28:28,136
- Debbie.
- How are you?

236
00:28:28,219 --> 00:28:31,639
I want you to get Legal on a corporate
confidentiality agreement.

237
00:28:31,723 --> 00:28:34,100
- Okay.
- Boundaries of their constraint,

238
00:28:34,184 --> 00:28:37,104
Kentucky state law about...

239
00:28:37,188 --> 00:28:39,106
- I want you to drop everything.
- Okay.

240
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:41,525
- I don't have any change. You got some change?
- Oh, here.

241
00:28:50,451 --> 00:28:52,411
Tony.

242
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,473
Mr. Wigand? You can go up now.

243
00:29:33,123 --> 00:29:35,417
Sorry. I'm accepting
an award...

244
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:39,254
from the Retinitis
Pigmentosa Foundation.

245
00:29:39,295 --> 00:29:41,673
It's gonna kill
the rest of my day.

246
00:29:47,303 --> 00:29:51,435
So, have you had a chance
to play golf?

247
00:29:51,518 --> 00:29:55,355
Jeffs a premier golfer.
What are you, a two handicap?

248
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:58,650
- Seven.
- And he gets out there...

249
00:29:58,734 --> 00:30:01,403
and he has
five strokes on us.

250
00:30:01,445 --> 00:30:04,740
He has more concentration
than anybody I've ever met.

251
00:30:04,781 --> 00:30:08,244
It's spooky
how he can concentrate.

252
00:30:11,205 --> 00:30:13,458
I'd rather play
than talk about it.

253
00:30:15,084 --> 00:30:17,754
What did you
want to see me about?

254
00:30:17,837 --> 00:30:19,797
I don't like
being back here.

255
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:22,633
Jeffrey says exactly
what's on his mind.

256
00:30:22,675 --> 00:30:25,637
Most people consider
what they're saying... social skills.

257
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,640
Jeffrey just charges
right ahead.

258
00:30:28,682 --> 00:30:33,687
Now, I know you understood the nature
of the confidentiality portion...

259
00:30:33,771 --> 00:30:36,648
of your severance agreement
with Brown &Williamson.

260
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:39,651
- Chapter and verse.
- Yeah, I know you do.

261
00:30:39,693 --> 00:30:43,657
You know, I came up
through sales.

262
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:46,118
One of the reasons
I was a great salesman...

263
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,246
was I never made a promise
I couldn't keep.

264
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:52,041
I knew that if l ever
broke my promise,

265
00:30:52,124 --> 00:30:54,794
I'd suffer
the consequence.

266
00:30:54,877 --> 00:30:56,754
Is that a threat?

267
00:30:58,047 --> 00:31:01,468
We worked together for...
What was it, three years?

268
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:04,471
Now, the work we did here is
confidential, not for public scrutiny...

269
00:31:04,513 --> 00:31:06,640
any more than
are one's family matters.

270
00:31:06,723 --> 00:31:09,017
You're threatening
my family now too?

271
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:12,687
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.

272
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:16,234
About the direction of research here,
we may have had our differences, but...

273
00:31:16,317 --> 00:31:21,030
Research. You declare as a badge of honor
you don't even know what makes water boil.

274
00:31:21,072 --> 00:31:23,574
Well, that's why
we hire scientists.

275
00:31:23,658 --> 00:31:26,953
Okay.

276
00:31:27,036 --> 00:31:29,872
I don't believe that you can
maintain corporate integrity...

277
00:31:29,914 --> 00:31:32,709
without
confidentiality agreements.

278
00:31:32,792 --> 00:31:34,838
I was paid well
for my work,

279
00:31:34,879 --> 00:31:37,924
the health and welfare
benefits are good,

280
00:31:38,007 --> 00:31:40,385
the severance package
is fair.

281
00:31:40,427 --> 00:31:44,389
I have no intention of violating
my confidentiality agreement...

282
00:31:44,472 --> 00:31:48,101
and disclosing that
which l said l wouldn't.

283
00:31:49,561 --> 00:31:51,981
I appreciate
all that, Jeff,

284
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:57,611
but upon reflection, we've decided
to expand our zone of comfort with you,

285
00:31:57,695 --> 00:32:00,781
so we've drafted a supplement
to your agreement.

286
00:32:02,158 --> 00:32:05,494
It broadly defines and
expands in more detail...

287
00:32:05,578 --> 00:32:07,538
what is confidential.

288
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:11,376
Nobody will be able
to say, "Well, hell's bells, Margaret,

289
00:32:11,418 --> 00:32:14,004
I didn't know that
was a secret."

290
00:32:14,087 --> 00:32:17,340
We're very serious
about protecting our interests.

291
00:32:17,424 --> 00:32:20,177
We'd like you
to sign it.

292
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,889
And if l don't?

293
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:27,394
If we arrive at the conclusion
that you're acting in bad faith,

294
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:31,440
we would terminate right now
payoffs under your severance package,

295
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:36,612
you and your family's medical benefits and
initiate litigation against you, Mr. Wigand.

296
00:32:38,113 --> 00:32:42,034
- Dr. Wigand.
- Dr. Wigand.

297
00:32:42,117 --> 00:32:45,747
If you've examined the document, you'll
see it's in your own best interest...

298
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,957
and you'll sign it.

299
00:32:53,755 --> 00:32:58,259
What you're saying is it isn't enough
that you fired me for no good reason.

300
00:32:58,301 --> 00:33:00,345
Now you question
my integrity?

301
00:33:00,428 --> 00:33:05,101
On top of the humiliation
of being fired, you threaten me,

302
00:33:05,142 --> 00:33:08,479
you threaten
my family.

303
00:33:08,562 --> 00:33:11,690
It never crossed my mind
not to honor my agreement.

304
00:33:11,774 --> 00:33:14,735
I will tell you, Mr. Sandefur...
And Brown &Williamson too...

305
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:17,989
Fuck me?
Well, fuck you!

306
00:33:27,834 --> 00:33:31,003
I'm not sure
he got the message.

307
00:33:31,087 --> 00:33:33,798
Oh, I think he did.

308
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,021
- Yeah.
- You fucked me!

309
00:33:49,273 --> 00:33:51,817
- Who's this?
- Protect your sources?

310
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,861
You screwed me.
You sold me out.

311
00:33:55,696 --> 00:34:00,368
- What are you talking about? Where are you?
- Fuck you too!

312
00:37:23,169 --> 00:37:25,463
Stay away from me.

313
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,217
You stay away from me!

314
00:37:37,436 --> 00:37:40,355
Jeffrey, you forgot
the lunches!

315
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,823
- Mrs. Wigand?
- Jump in quick. Come on.

316
00:37:48,906 --> 00:37:52,452
How do you do? I'm Lowell Bergman.
We spoke on the phone.

317
00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:57,582
- Come here. I want to talk to you.
- Good. I want to talk to you.

318
00:37:57,665 --> 00:38:00,585
- This is my house. In front of my wife, my kids?
- I did not burn you.

319
00:38:00,626 --> 00:38:02,837
I did not give you up
to anyone.

320
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,091
- What business do we have?
- I'm here to straighten something out with you.

321
00:38:06,133 --> 00:38:08,135
Right here, right now.

322
00:38:08,177 --> 00:38:10,804
You haven't mentioned my name?
You haven't talked to anybody about me?

323
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:12,306
- What am I gonna mention your name for?
- Why are Brown &Williamson...

324
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:14,308
How the hell do I know about
Brown &Williamson?

325
00:38:14,391 --> 00:38:17,853
It happened just after I talked to you.
I do not like coincidences.

326
00:38:17,936 --> 00:38:20,856
Well, I don't like paranoid accusations.
I'm a journalist.

327
00:38:20,939 --> 00:38:25,070
Think. Use your head. How do I operate
as a journalist? By screwing the people...

328
00:38:25,153 --> 00:38:29,366
who could provide me with information
before they provided me with it?

329
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:32,787
- You came all the way down here to tell me that?
- No, I did not.

330
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,914
Big Tobacco
is a big story,

331
00:38:34,997 --> 00:38:37,374
and you got something
important to say. I can tell.

332
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:41,004
But yes, I did. I came all
the way down here to tell you...

333
00:38:41,088 --> 00:38:44,132
Story, no story...
Fuck your story.

334
00:38:45,717 --> 00:38:48,512
I don't burn people.

335
00:39:19,462 --> 00:39:22,173
Ride with me while I
take the girls to school.

336
00:39:51,162 --> 00:39:53,373
My little girl has a cute asthma.

337
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:57,169
Deborah, my oldest daughter.

338
00:39:57,252 --> 00:40:00,589
And I'm unemployed, so I have
to protect my medical coverage.

339
00:40:02,758 --> 00:40:06,720
So I left them a message this morning.
Their expanded confidentiality agreement...

340
00:40:08,889 --> 00:40:11,560
I will sign it.

341
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:14,396
- They're afraid of you, aren't they?
- They should be.

342
00:40:21,195 --> 00:40:24,031
Talk to me outside the zone
of your agreement.

343
00:40:24,114 --> 00:40:28,161
- Like what?
- Like, uh, where'd you work before Brown &Williamson?

344
00:40:28,244 --> 00:40:30,538
Johnson &ohnson.

345
00:40:30,622 --> 00:40:32,624
Union Carbide in Japan.

346
00:40:32,707 --> 00:40:36,169
I was the general manager and director
of new products. I speak Japanese.

347
00:40:36,252 --> 00:40:40,590
I was a director
of corporate development at Pfizer.

348
00:40:40,632 --> 00:40:43,259
All health-related.

349
00:40:45,763 --> 00:40:47,723
What else
outside the zone?

350
00:40:50,101 --> 00:40:52,686
I don't know. Do you think the Knicks
are gonna make it to the semifinals?

351
00:41:05,868 --> 00:41:07,703
- Just give me an example.
- Okay.

352
00:41:07,787 --> 00:41:10,665
For example, um,
James Burke.

353
00:41:10,706 --> 00:41:12,834
- C.E.O. Of Johnson &Johnson.
- Yeah.

354
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:17,713
When he found out that some lunatic
had put poison in Tylenol bottles,

355
00:41:17,797 --> 00:41:19,715
he didn't argue
with the F.D.A.

356
00:41:19,799 --> 00:41:22,469
He didn't even wait for the F.D.A.
To tell him. He just pulled Tylenol...

357
00:41:22,553 --> 00:41:26,890
off every shelf of every store
right across America, instantly.

358
00:41:26,974 --> 00:41:30,144
And then he developed a safety cap.

359
00:41:30,227 --> 00:41:34,815
Because as a C.E.O, sure, he's
gotta be a great businessman, right?

360
00:41:34,898 --> 00:41:37,317
But he's also
a man of science.

361
00:41:37,401 --> 00:41:42,699
He's not gonna allow his company to put on
the shelf a product that might hurt people.

362
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,868
Not like
the Seven Dwarfs.

363
00:41:44,909 --> 00:41:47,704
- Seven Dwarfs?
- Seven C.E.O.s of Big Tobacco.

364
00:41:47,746 --> 00:41:49,873
They got in front of Congress
that time. It was on television.

365
00:41:49,914 --> 00:41:52,625
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Swore under oath that
they know nothing about addiction...

366
00:41:52,709 --> 00:41:54,712
It was on C-SPAN.
Yeah.

367
00:41:54,754 --> 00:41:59,885
Okay, so, here you are.
You-You-You go to work for tobacco.

368
00:41:59,926 --> 00:42:02,846
You come from corporate cultures
where research...

369
00:42:02,929 --> 00:42:05,557
really creative thinking...
These are core values.

370
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:09,019
You go to tobacco.
Tobacco is a sales culture...

371
00:42:09,102 --> 00:42:12,147
market and sell enormous volume,
go to a lot of golf tournaments.

372
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,484
The hell with everything else.
What are you doing?

373
00:42:14,567 --> 00:42:17,278
- Why are you working for tobacco in the first place?
- I can't talk about it.

374
00:42:17,361 --> 00:42:20,072
The work I was supposed to do...

375
00:42:20,156 --> 00:42:23,242
might have had some positive effect,
I don't know.

376
00:42:23,284 --> 00:42:27,997
Could have been beneficial.
Mostly, I got paid a lot.

377
00:42:28,081 --> 00:42:31,334
I took the money.
My wife was happy.

378
00:42:31,417 --> 00:42:34,671
My kids had good medical,
good schools. Got a great house.

379
00:42:34,755 --> 00:42:36,965
I mean, what the hell
is wrong with that?

380
00:42:37,049 --> 00:42:39,593
Nothing's wrong with that. That's it.
You're making money.

381
00:42:39,676 --> 00:42:42,346
You're providing for your family.
What could be wrong with that?

382
00:42:45,433 --> 00:42:49,187
I always thought of myself as a man of
science, that's what's wrong with it.

383
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:54,276
Then you're in
a state of conflict, Jeff.

384
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,071
Because look,
here's how it lays out.

385
00:42:57,154 --> 00:42:59,115
If you've got vital
insider stuff,

386
00:42:59,156 --> 00:43:01,826
the American people, for their
welfare, really do need to know,

387
00:43:01,909 --> 00:43:03,869
and you feel impelled
to disclose it...

388
00:43:03,953 --> 00:43:07,124
and violate your agreement
in doing so, that's one thing.

389
00:43:07,207 --> 00:43:11,128
On the other hand, if you want
to honor this agreement,

390
00:43:11,169 --> 00:43:13,463
then that's simple...
You do so.

391
00:43:13,505 --> 00:43:15,715
You say nothing,
you do nothing.

392
00:43:15,799 --> 00:43:19,010
There's only one guy
who can figure that out for you,

393
00:43:19,094 --> 00:43:21,930
and that's you
all by yourself.

394
00:43:28,062 --> 00:43:30,189
I gotta go pick up the girls.
They only had a half a day.

395
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,338
l've heard virtually
all the... We touched on it...

396
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:56,134
- Yes or no, do you believe nicotine is not addictive?
- Congressman,

397
00:43:56,217 --> 00:44:01,390
cigarettes and nicotine clearly do not
meet the classic definitions of addiction.

398
00:44:01,474 --> 00:44:04,143
- There is no intoxication.
- We'll take that as no.

399
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:06,187
Again, time is short.

400
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:08,856
I think each of you believe
nicotine is not addictive...

401
00:44:08,898 --> 00:44:11,275
and just would like to
have this for the record.

402
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:15,404
I believe that nicotine
is not addictive.

403
00:44:15,488 --> 00:44:17,907
I too believe
that nicotine...

404
00:44:17,948 --> 00:44:20,994
He referred to this...
The Sewen Dwarfs...

405
00:44:21,077 --> 00:44:24,039
- What Seven Dwarfs?
- The seven C.E.O. Of Big Tobacco... Referred to this.

406
00:44:24,122 --> 00:44:28,168
Said they should be afraid of him.
I assume afraid of what he could reveal.

407
00:44:28,251 --> 00:44:33,091
Now you tell me. What does this guy
have to say that threatens these people?

408
00:44:33,174 --> 00:44:35,343
Well, it isn't cigarettes
are bad for you.

409
00:44:35,426 --> 00:44:37,679
- Hardly new news.
- No shit.

410
00:44:39,306 --> 00:44:43,852
- What's this?
- What that is is tobacco's standard defense.

411
00:44:43,936 --> 00:44:45,854
It's the "we don't know"
litany.

412
00:44:45,938 --> 00:44:49,775
Addiction? We believe not.
Disease? We don't know.

413
00:44:49,817 --> 00:44:52,653
We take a bunch of leaves,
we roll them together, you smoke 'em.

414
00:44:52,736 --> 00:44:56,074
After that, you're on your own.
We don't know.

415
00:44:56,116 --> 00:44:58,201
So, that
tells me nothing.

416
00:44:58,284 --> 00:45:01,496
- Besides, you'll never get what he's got.
- Why not?

417
00:45:01,579 --> 00:45:03,623
Because of this guy's
confidentiality agreement,

418
00:45:03,706 --> 00:45:06,084
he's never gonna be able
to talk to you.

419
00:45:06,126 --> 00:45:08,753
That's not good enough.
This guy is the top scientist...

420
00:45:08,837 --> 00:45:11,297
in the number-three
tobacco company in America.

421
00:45:11,381 --> 00:45:15,344
He's a corporate officer. You never get
whistle-blowers from Fortune 500 companies.

422
00:45:15,428 --> 00:45:18,097
This guy is
the ultimate insider.

423
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:21,226
He's got something to say. He wants
to say it. I want it on 60 Minutes.

424
00:45:21,309 --> 00:45:23,437
- Doesn't matter what he wants.
Am l missing something here?

425
00:45:23,478 --> 00:45:26,773
- What do you mean, Mike?
- He's got a corporate secrecy agreement.

426
00:45:26,815 --> 00:45:29,067
Give me a break.

427
00:45:29,151 --> 00:45:32,989
This is a public health issue, like an
unsafe air frame on a passenger jet...

428
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,825
or some company dumping cyanide
into the East River.

429
00:45:35,908 --> 00:45:38,619
Issues like that.
He can talk, we can air it.

430
00:45:38,661 --> 00:45:42,206
They've got no right to hide behind
a corporate agreement. Pass the milk.

431
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:44,959
They don't need the right.
They got the money.

432
00:45:45,001 --> 00:45:48,380
The unlimited checkbook.
That's how Big Tobacco wins...

433
00:45:48,464 --> 00:45:50,466
every time
on everything.

434
00:45:50,507 --> 00:45:55,679
They spend you to death.
$600 million a year in outside legal.

435
00:45:55,763 --> 00:45:59,683
Chadbourne-Park, Ken Starr's firm,
Kirkland and Ellis.

436
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:02,478
Listen, G.M. And Ford,
they get nailed...

437
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:05,523
after 11 or 12 pickups
blow up, right?

438
00:46:05,607 --> 00:46:08,818
- These clowns have never... I mean ever...
- Not even once.

439
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:12,364
Not even with hundreds of thousands
dying each year from an illness...

440
00:46:12,448 --> 00:46:16,118
related to their product have ever
lost a personal injury lawsuit.

441
00:46:16,202 --> 00:46:19,580
On this case, they'll issue gag orders,
sue for breach... anticipatory breach...

442
00:46:19,663 --> 00:46:24,419
enjoin him, you, us,
his pet dog, the dog's veterinarian,

443
00:46:24,503 --> 00:46:27,923
tie 'em up in litigation for ten or 1 5
years, I'm telling you, they bat a thousand.

444
00:46:28,006 --> 00:46:31,718
Every time. He knows that.
That's why he's not gonna talk to you.

445
00:46:38,809 --> 00:46:42,688
Okay, let's look through
the looking glass the other way.

446
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:45,358
What do you mean?

447
00:46:45,399 --> 00:46:47,777
We got a guy who wants to talk,
but he's constrained.

448
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:51,030
- What if he were compelled to talk?
- Oh, torture. Great ratings.

449
00:46:51,072 --> 00:46:53,241
What do you mean, "compelled"?

450
00:46:53,324 --> 00:46:56,494
I mean, compelled
by a, uh, Justice Department.

451
00:46:56,577 --> 00:46:58,705
State courts.
Be a witness.

452
00:46:58,789 --> 00:47:02,042
That would cut through any
confidentiality agreement, wouldn't it?

453
00:47:02,084 --> 00:47:04,462
- What does that do?
- What do you mean, what does it do?

454
00:47:04,546 --> 00:47:07,882
What I mean is like, how does it cut
through the confidentiality agreement?

455
00:47:07,924 --> 00:47:10,760
Because he has to, uh,
reveal it in a court of law.

456
00:47:10,844 --> 00:47:13,596
It's on record. It's out.
It's no secret anymore.

457
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,518
So how can they restrain his speech
or retaliate? It's out in the world.

458
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:20,229
If you could engineer it into the
court record, you might have something.

459
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:23,315
They would have a hell of a time trying
to restrain his speech then, wouldn't they?

460
00:47:23,399 --> 00:47:27,153
Yeah, but what venue? And where does
he get... Does he have killer attorneys?

461
00:47:27,236 --> 00:47:30,114
I don't think he's got
any attorneys.

462
00:47:30,197 --> 00:47:33,743
He's gonna need attorneys who aren't
afraid of risking years of litigation...

463
00:47:33,827 --> 00:47:38,165
and millions of dollars
of their own dough in legal costs.

464
00:47:38,248 --> 00:47:40,750
What do you say, Mike?
What do you think?

465
00:47:43,336 --> 00:47:45,839
Even if he gets
the defense team,

466
00:47:50,343 --> 00:47:52,930
will he go for it?

467
00:47:59,021 --> 00:48:02,149
You're awfully
over qualified, Dr. Wigand.

468
00:48:08,906 --> 00:48:11,326
I'm trying to start
a new career.

469
00:48:13,244 --> 00:48:15,288
I believe I could be
a good teacher.

470
00:48:20,168 --> 00:48:22,086
Let me give it
some thought.

471
00:48:26,633 --> 00:48:30,846
And not a lot of companies in the health
care field hire ex-tobacco scientists.

472
00:49:05,092 --> 00:49:07,010
That's it.

473
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:18,272
It's where
our babies were born.

474
00:49:22,026 --> 00:49:24,404
Debbie took her first steps
right there on...

475
00:49:26,531 --> 00:49:28,450
In the grass.

476
00:49:31,536 --> 00:49:35,123
- I didn't plan on this.
- Hey, hey, hey.

477
00:49:35,206 --> 00:49:37,292
Come on. Come on.

478
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:45,510
We can make this
work for us. Okay?

479
00:49:45,552 --> 00:49:47,512
It's just...
It's not...

480
00:49:47,554 --> 00:49:50,390
It's just...
It's a smaller scale.

481
00:49:50,474 --> 00:49:54,394
Simpler, easier.

482
00:49:54,436 --> 00:49:58,691
More time.
More time together.

483
00:49:58,733 --> 00:50:01,027
More time
with the kids.

484
00:50:01,068 --> 00:50:03,905
More time for us.
Okay? It's just...

485
00:50:06,741 --> 00:50:10,411
Can you imagine me
coming home from some job...

486
00:50:10,495 --> 00:50:12,663
feeling good
at the end of the day?

487
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:17,085
This is gonna be better.

488
00:50:19,755 --> 00:50:22,090
This is gonna be better.

489
00:50:40,778 --> 00:50:43,531
Love your home
with beautiful Broyhill furniture...

492
00:51:00,799 --> 00:51:04,344
If you've been putting off
decorating that special room,

493
00:51:04,427 --> 00:51:08,391
now's the time to act during the
lowe-your-home sale at Smith's.

494
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:12,103
- Back to...
- Welcome back.

495
00:51:27,495 --> 00:51:29,956
Hey, baby.
What's wrong?

496
00:51:29,998 --> 00:51:32,125
Who's that outside,
Daddy?

497
00:51:34,335 --> 00:51:37,130
- Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
- I heard him.

498
00:51:38,756 --> 00:51:41,342
- Where?
- In the backyard.

499
00:51:58,277 --> 00:52:01,156
Sit at Daddy's desk, okay?
Why don't you sit up at the desk.

500
00:52:01,198 --> 00:52:03,158
All right?

501
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,329
Get out some paper,
and draw me a picture. Okay?

502
00:52:12,876 --> 00:52:17,006
What are you gonna draw me, baby?
An animal? Something like that?

503
00:52:17,048 --> 00:52:20,219
You stay down here until Daddy
gets back, all right, Barbara?

504
00:52:20,302 --> 00:52:22,221
You stay down here.

505
00:53:19,615 --> 00:53:21,951
You almost got
your damn head blown off.

506
00:54:01,785 --> 00:54:03,704
Daddy!

507
00:54:04,831 --> 00:54:08,627
It was just a racoon, baby.
Nothin'.

508
00:54:08,668 --> 00:54:11,171
They're nocturnal.
You know what that means?

509
00:54:11,254 --> 00:54:13,673
That means that they
only come out at nighttime.

510
00:54:26,771 --> 00:54:27,939
- Yeah.
- Lowell. Jeffrey Wigand.

511
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:30,775
- Yeah.
- Lowell. Jeffrey Wigand.

512
00:54:30,817 --> 00:54:34,111
Is it too late?

513
00:54:34,195 --> 00:54:36,280
No, no, it's okay. I...

514
00:54:36,364 --> 00:54:38,282
How-How's the new place?

515
00:54:38,366 --> 00:54:40,786
The new place?
New.

516
00:54:40,828 --> 00:54:44,289
- You okay?
- Sure.

517
00:54:44,331 --> 00:54:47,793
I was thinking of
calling you tomorrow anyway.

518
00:54:47,835 --> 00:54:52,507
- Uh, how's your kids, uh, handling the new house?
- Good.

519
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:55,802
- You got kids?
- We have a couple.

520
00:54:55,885 --> 00:54:59,849
One's hers, one's mine.
Everybody uses a different name.

521
00:54:59,932 --> 00:55:01,851
Modern marriage.

522
00:55:01,934 --> 00:55:04,145
Uh, how's Liane?

523
00:55:05,855 --> 00:55:09,150
Uh, she's okay. Uh...

524
00:55:09,233 --> 00:55:11,152
Hold on a minute.

525
00:55:17,909 --> 00:55:20,328
Lowell.

526
00:55:20,412 --> 00:55:23,623
Somebody may be following me. I-l don't
know. They came on the property.

527
00:55:23,707 --> 00:55:26,960
What do you mean, following you?
Did you call the police?

528
00:55:27,043 --> 00:55:30,005
I-l don't wanna be paranoid.
I mean...

529
00:55:30,088 --> 00:55:33,801
- Maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
- What do you really think?

530
00:55:33,885 --> 00:55:35,803
I don't know what the fuck
I really think.

531
00:55:35,887 --> 00:55:38,848
Are they doing it?
Ls some crank doing it?

532
00:55:38,931 --> 00:55:40,851
Are they doing it
to make me feel paranoid?

533
00:55:40,934 --> 00:55:43,854
Are they doing it for real and don't
give a shit what I think? I don't know.

534
00:55:43,896 --> 00:55:46,815
- I don't fuckin' know.
- Jeffrey, describe for me...

535
00:55:46,899 --> 00:55:48,859
in detail what happened.

536
00:55:48,901 --> 00:55:50,944
Well...

537
00:55:51,028 --> 00:55:54,574
No. Look, I mean, there was
a footprint. Forget it.

538
00:55:54,657 --> 00:55:57,160
It's probably
not important at all.

539
00:55:57,243 --> 00:56:02,081
You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching
high school. Japanese and Chemistry.

540
00:56:04,125 --> 00:56:07,337
Uh, so, uh, what were you
calling about?

541
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:10,841
- You called me.
- No, you said you were gonna call me tomorrow.

542
00:56:10,925 --> 00:56:13,719
- So, what about?
- Oh, yes, yes, yes. I did. I wanted to talk to you.

543
00:56:13,802 --> 00:56:18,557
I wanted to hook up with you, talk to you
about what we were talking about in your car.

544
00:56:20,684 --> 00:56:22,603
Okay.

545
00:56:22,686 --> 00:56:26,190
It makes you feel good,
putting what you know to use?

546
00:56:28,777 --> 00:56:31,697
- How'd you know that, Lowell?
- It's obvious, isn't it?

547
00:56:34,826 --> 00:56:37,161
Hello?
Are you there?

548
00:56:37,245 --> 00:56:39,705
Yeah.

549
00:56:39,789 --> 00:56:42,291
Look, um...

550
00:56:42,375 --> 00:56:44,628
Thanks for talking.
I'm sorry I woke you up.

551
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:48,298
- I didn't know.
- It's okay.

552
00:56:56,807 --> 00:57:00,644
Lowell.

553
00:57:00,727 --> 00:57:02,647
Who is this?

554
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:05,316
Donot call here!
Donot...

555
00:57:29,968 --> 00:57:31,887
What are you
gonna get us?

556
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:33,930
Tempura.

557
00:57:37,852 --> 00:57:40,313
The lnternet said you did
graduate work at Wisconsin,

558
00:57:40,396 --> 00:57:43,900
then went to U.C. La Jolla
with Professor Herbert?

559
00:57:43,983 --> 00:57:46,360
- Marcus...
- Marcuse. Yeah.

560
00:57:46,444 --> 00:57:48,738
He was my mentor.

561
00:57:48,821 --> 00:57:51,991
He had a major influence
on the New Left in the late '60s.

562
00:57:52,033 --> 00:57:54,076
And on me, personally.

563
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,663
- Next to your father?
- My father?

564
00:57:56,747 --> 00:57:59,333
What the hell's that got
to do with my father?

565
00:58:01,543 --> 00:58:03,629
I, uh...

566
00:58:03,712 --> 00:58:07,633
Is that why you became a journalist?
Then you get to ask all the questions?

567
00:58:07,716 --> 00:58:11,094
You charge by the hour?

568
00:58:11,178 --> 00:58:14,057
My father was a...
A mechanical engineer.

569
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,060
Most ingenious man
I ever knew.

570
00:58:16,143 --> 00:58:18,145
My father left us
when I was five years old.

571
00:58:18,229 --> 00:58:20,189
He was not the most ingenious man
I ever knew.

572
00:58:20,231 --> 00:58:24,860
Let's get back to Brown &Williamson.
If you decide to go on 60 Minutes,

573
00:58:24,902 --> 00:58:28,197
I gotta know everything
about why you were fired.

574
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:32,410
- Why?
- They're gonna dig up stuff from your past.

575
00:58:32,494 --> 00:58:36,039
They're gonna throw it at you.
I gotta know what they're gonna throw.

576
00:58:36,122 --> 00:58:38,041
You understand?

577
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:42,629
I drink.

578
00:58:42,712 --> 00:58:45,382
- Couple of occasions more
than I should have. - Um-hmm.

579
00:58:49,011 --> 00:58:52,348
I was cited for shoplifting
once, but it was a mistake.

580
00:58:55,017 --> 00:58:57,979
Pushed Liane one time. We were both
stressed out because of the pressure.

581
00:58:58,062 --> 00:59:00,731
She went to her mother's.

582
00:59:00,773 --> 00:59:03,776
I got, uh, fired,
because, uh,

583
00:59:03,818 --> 00:59:06,656
when I get angry, I have
difficulty censoring myself,

584
00:59:06,739 --> 00:59:09,576
and I don't like
to be pushed around.

585
00:59:09,659 --> 00:59:13,121
I'm not pushing you around.
I'm asking you questions.

586
00:59:15,623 --> 00:59:18,209
I'm just a commodity
to you, aren't l?

587
00:59:18,293 --> 00:59:21,629
I could be anything, right? Anything
worth putting on between commercials.

588
00:59:21,713 --> 00:59:24,090
To a network, probably,
we're all commodities.

589
00:59:24,174 --> 00:59:26,635
To me, you're not a commodity.
What you are is important.

590
00:59:28,554 --> 00:59:31,974
You go public, and 30 million people
hear what you gotta say,

591
00:59:32,057 --> 00:59:35,603
nothing... I mean nothing...
Will ever be the same again.

592
00:59:35,686 --> 00:59:37,897
- You believe that?
- No.

593
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:40,733
You should. Because when
you're done the judgement...

594
00:59:40,816 --> 00:59:44,779
is gonna go down in the court
of public opinion, my friend.

595
00:59:44,863 --> 00:59:47,449
And that's...
The power you have.

596
00:59:47,532 --> 00:59:50,785
- You believe that?
- I believe that?

597
00:59:50,869 --> 00:59:52,787
- Yes, I believe that.
- You believe that...

598
00:59:52,871 --> 00:59:55,624
- because you get information out to people, something happens?
- Yes.

599
00:59:55,665 --> 00:59:58,544
Maybe that's just what you've been
telling yourself all these years...

600
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:00,547
to justify having a good job.

601
01:00:00,631 --> 01:00:02,591
Having status.

602
01:00:02,633 --> 01:00:05,677
Maybe for the audience it's just voyeurism,
something to do on a Sunday night.

603
01:00:05,761 --> 01:00:07,763
Maybe it won't
change a fuckin' thing,

604
01:00:07,846 --> 01:00:10,307
and people like myself
and my family...

605
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:14,520
are left hung out to dry,
used up, broke, alone.

606
01:00:14,603 --> 01:00:17,606
Are you talking to me, or did somebody
else just walk in here? I never...

607
01:00:19,526 --> 01:00:23,363
Don't evade a choice you gotta make
by questioning my reputation...

608
01:00:23,446 --> 01:00:25,824
or 60 Minutes
with this cheap skepticism.

609
01:00:25,907 --> 01:00:28,827
I have to put my family's welfare
on the line here, my friend.

610
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:31,538
- What are you putting up? You're putting up words.
- "Words."

611
01:00:31,621 --> 01:00:34,833
While you've been dicking around some
fucking company golf tournaments,

612
01:00:34,916 --> 01:00:37,795
I've been out in the world
givin' my word...

613
01:00:37,878 --> 01:00:40,381
and backing it up
with action.

614
01:00:44,552 --> 01:00:47,179
Now, are you gonna go
and do this thing or not?

615
01:00:49,932 --> 01:00:52,227
I said I'd call the kids
before they went to bed.

616
01:01:05,241 --> 01:01:09,203
Stringer was supposed to be shooting
B-roll on street cops in New Orleans.

617
01:01:09,287 --> 01:01:12,624
- What's with all the horses?
- Camera guy's got a thing about mounted police.

618
01:01:12,749 --> 01:01:16,295
Don't any of these guys
ride in cars? Walk?

619
01:01:16,336 --> 01:01:18,630
- How long are these things?
- What was he saying?

620
01:01:18,672 --> 01:01:21,175
Hello. Yes, I'm trying
to reach Mr. Richard Scruggs.

621
01:01:21,216 --> 01:01:23,677
This is Richard Scruggs.

622
01:01:23,719 --> 01:01:25,679
Can you hold on
a second, please?

623
01:01:25,721 --> 01:01:28,056
Lowell, got him
on the phone.

624
01:01:31,436 --> 01:01:34,480
- Hello, I'm Lowell Bergman.
- Hold on.

625
01:01:34,564 --> 01:01:38,318
Mobile Approach, this is
Leo-November-643. Over.

626
01:01:40,987 --> 01:01:42,990
Request a flight level
of220...

627
01:01:43,073 --> 01:01:45,659
on a heading
of284 degrees. Over.

628
01:01:47,496 --> 01:01:49,498
- Mr. Bergman?
- Yes, I'm right here.

629
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:52,292
- Could you call me back on a hard line?
- All right.

630
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:57,923
- Area code 21 2-555-01 99.
- I'll call you then.

631
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,724
What do we do with that?

632
01:02:06,807 --> 01:02:09,268
I don't know.

633
01:02:09,352 --> 01:02:11,270
Richard Scruggs.

634
01:02:11,354 --> 01:02:14,565
You filed a lawsuit against tobacco
on behalf of the state of Mississippi.

635
01:02:14,649 --> 01:02:16,567
- Did you not?
- That's right.

636
01:02:16,651 --> 01:02:21,197
I'm working with someone now who's the
former head of research at Brown &Williamson.

637
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,867
Former corporate officer there.

638
01:02:23,951 --> 01:02:25,911
What's your interest
in this, Mr. Bergman?

639
01:02:25,994 --> 01:02:28,288
Well, he may tape
an interview with us,

640
01:02:28,372 --> 01:02:31,708
and we believe if his testimony
showed up in a court record first,

641
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:35,797
it would free him up from his confidentiality
agreement and give him some protection.

642
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,842
It could work. If it's public record,
it's public record.

643
01:02:38,925 --> 01:02:41,220
Yeah, and he's gonna need
legal representation.

644
01:02:41,303 --> 01:02:43,556
He sure as hell will.

645
01:02:43,639 --> 01:02:46,392
Has he decided
to go public?

646
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:49,144
Because let me tell ya.
We been doin' this for three years now,

647
01:02:49,228 --> 01:02:52,773
and we've worked with a lot of corporate
cases involving whistle-blowers.

648
01:02:52,857 --> 01:02:56,110
So we know Big Tobacco will do
everything in their power to stop him.

649
01:02:56,193 --> 01:02:59,239
So is your man
truly committed?

650
01:02:59,322 --> 01:03:02,659
Well, actually, no... Well, he's
on the fence. That's the point.

651
01:03:05,370 --> 01:03:08,748
Well, we'd certainly be interested
in making his acquaintance.

652
01:03:08,832 --> 01:03:11,334
But without knowing
what he's gonna do...

653
01:03:11,418 --> 01:03:14,754
Would you want him to call you, or you
wanna call him? How do you wanna do it?

654
01:03:14,838 --> 01:03:17,717
It would be better
if he called us.

655
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,760
- Yeah. Okay.
- All right?

656
01:03:19,844 --> 01:03:22,096
Okay. Thank you.
Shit.

657
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:28,854
We need cops on the streets.
We don't need them on horses.

658
01:03:28,937 --> 01:03:30,814
- I don't know what he was thinking.
- For God's sake.

659
01:03:30,898 --> 01:03:32,941
- This guy got a horse fetish?
- All right, all right.

660
01:03:33,025 --> 01:03:35,195
Get me, uh...
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon.

661
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:37,488
I'll shoot
the fucking thing myself!

662
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:40,867
- Have a good one.
- All right.

663
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,641
What are you cooking?

664
01:04:03,682 --> 01:04:07,561
- I'm cooking pasta primavera.
- Oh, l love that stuff.

665
01:04:11,191 --> 01:04:13,151
I'm going to
have to go downstairs.

666
01:04:45,103 --> 01:04:46,855
Jeffrey!

667
01:05:09,004 --> 01:05:11,047
Jeffrey! Jeffrey!

668
01:05:11,131 --> 01:05:14,426
Jeffrey! Jeffrey!

669
01:05:42,623 --> 01:05:46,585
- What happened?
- Dispatcher received a call of shots fired in the area.

670
01:05:46,627 --> 01:05:51,298
Uniforms arrived on the scene, found
this white male subject shot to death.

671
01:05:51,381 --> 01:05:54,635
- Was it gang related?
- There's no indication...

672
01:05:54,718 --> 01:05:59,599
as far as a tag or an advertisement.

673
01:05:59,641 --> 01:06:02,186
Yeah.

674
01:06:03,646 --> 01:06:06,357
They're terrorizing us.
Death threats. My family, my kids.

675
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,359
Whoa. What are you
talking about?

676
01:06:08,442 --> 01:06:11,904
- Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
- Jeff, call the F.B.I.

677
01:06:11,987 --> 01:06:14,282
- Right away.
- They do this with impunity.

678
01:06:14,324 --> 01:06:16,826
- Jeff...
- They get to go home at night.

679
01:06:16,868 --> 01:06:19,538
What does it cost these people
to do this to us? Nothing!

680
01:06:21,581 --> 01:06:24,125
My girls are crying.
So fuck them.

681
01:06:24,209 --> 01:06:26,294
- I wanna tape. I'm done...
- I heard you.

682
01:06:26,378 --> 01:06:28,880
I gotta arrange
for a legal defense first.

683
01:06:28,964 --> 01:06:32,051
I gotta get you to testify in court,
get it on public record.

684
01:06:32,134 --> 01:06:34,929
Then hold it off the air until you
got that, but I wanna go to New York,

685
01:06:35,012 --> 01:06:38,307
and I wanna go on the record...
Right now.

686
01:06:38,391 --> 01:06:42,645
- Good. But, Jeff...
- I'll call them, Lowell.

687
01:06:47,066 --> 01:06:50,863
Did you handle the round,
Mr. Wigand?

688
01:06:50,946 --> 01:06:52,866
Yes, I'm afraid I did.

689
01:06:52,949 --> 01:06:55,535
We won't be able to lift
usable prints.

690
01:06:57,495 --> 01:07:00,039
Do you own a gun,
Mr. Wigand?

691
01:07:01,249 --> 01:07:03,835
- A gun? Yes.
- What caliber is your gun?

692
01:07:05,295 --> 01:07:07,214
What caliber is my gun?

693
01:07:07,298 --> 01:07:10,217
Yes, sir.
What caliber is your gun?

694
01:07:10,301 --> 01:07:13,178
What does that have to do
with the price of tea in China?

695
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:19,852
You think I put the bullet
in the mailbox myself?

696
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:22,521
If we could
take a look, Mr. Wigand.

697
01:07:35,744 --> 01:07:37,704
Why do you keep this gun?

698
01:07:37,746 --> 01:07:41,249
I don't think it's unconstitutional
yet to own a gun. I'm a target shooter.

699
01:07:41,333 --> 01:07:44,421
That bullet was for a.38 caliber.
Do you own a.38?

700
01:07:44,504 --> 01:07:47,549
Yes, l do. A.38 Target Master
in my gun safe downstairs.

701
01:07:47,591 --> 01:07:50,719
A.45 Gold Cup,
a.22 target pistol. So what?

702
01:07:52,137 --> 01:07:55,766
Do you have a history
of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?

703
01:07:55,849 --> 01:07:57,893
Yeah. Yes, I do.

704
01:07:57,976 --> 01:08:01,731
Yes, I get extremely emotional when
assholes put bullets in my mailbox.

705
01:08:01,773 --> 01:08:05,902
I didn't tell you that so you could
pick it up and take it away.

706
01:08:05,944 --> 01:08:08,488
- Jeffrey!
- What's going on?

707
01:08:08,571 --> 01:08:10,490
I told them you had an e-mail
death threat that told you...

708
01:08:10,573 --> 01:08:12,492
if you didn't shut the " F" up,
they were gonna kill you.

709
01:08:12,575 --> 01:08:15,995
You can't take that. It's personal
property. My personal correspondence,

710
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:18,791
Ietters to my brother, my will.

711
01:08:30,344 --> 01:08:32,263
You all right?

712
01:08:41,649 --> 01:08:43,609
That computer has
every single...

713
01:08:44,944 --> 01:08:46,904
You all right, Mr. Wigand?

714
01:08:47,029 --> 01:08:49,949
We need to take a look
at your gun safe, Mr. Wigand.

715
01:09:07,009 --> 01:09:10,972
I'm telling you... your agents
in that office are acting improperly.

716
01:09:11,055 --> 01:09:13,016
Now who are they
trying to protect?

717
01:09:13,057 --> 01:09:15,018
Let me, tell you something,
Lowell. Look, look.

718
01:09:15,059 --> 01:09:17,312
You're talking about two agents
in a regional office in Louisville.

719
01:09:17,395 --> 01:09:20,607
I got the goddamned Unabomber
threatening to blow up L.A.X.

720
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:24,944
I gotta move 45 agents
from all over the country into L.A.

721
01:09:25,028 --> 01:09:26,947
All right? When I get a chance,
I'll give it a look.

722
01:09:27,031 --> 01:09:29,826
You better take a good
look because I'm getting two things:

723
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:32,120
pissed off and curious!

724
01:09:32,204 --> 01:09:37,000
Now, any of these guys been offered jobs
in corporate security after they retire?

725
01:09:37,042 --> 01:09:40,378
Either one of those guys got
ex-agent pals already in those jobs?

726
01:09:40,462 --> 01:09:43,715
Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor
who's already at Brown &Williamson...

727
01:09:43,798 --> 01:09:45,842
as we fuckin' speak!

728
01:09:45,926 --> 01:09:47,887
- I'll give it a look.
- You're getting my drift?

729
01:09:47,929 --> 01:09:49,889
I'll give it a look.

730
01:09:51,349 --> 01:09:53,684
So is everything okay?

731
01:09:55,311 --> 01:09:58,189
- How are the rooms? Comfortable?
- Yes, very.

732
01:09:58,231 --> 01:10:01,359
Do you know,
I enjoy your work so much.

733
01:10:01,442 --> 01:10:04,988
When you're talkin' to somebody,
I always feel like I'm right there.

734
01:10:05,072 --> 01:10:07,366
Thank you for saying that.

735
01:10:07,407 --> 01:10:09,576
Do you think we could
talk about the taping?

736
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:14,081
Tomorrow's taping? Just so we
can get it out of the way and order.

737
01:10:14,164 --> 01:10:19,212
Yeah, well, questions will go towards what work
you did there, why you were fired and other...

738
01:10:19,295 --> 01:10:21,881
Taping?

739
01:10:25,511 --> 01:10:29,598
- What are you taping?
- I'm doin' an interview.

740
01:10:32,434 --> 01:10:34,728
An interview?

741
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:42,946
Do you know what
they will do to us?

742
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:44,948
I thought we...

743
01:10:48,952 --> 01:10:50,912
I'm sorry.

744
01:10:50,954 --> 01:10:52,914
Liane, this is
a preliminary...

745
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:05,386
You didn't
tell her we were taping?

746
01:11:05,469 --> 01:11:09,223
What did she think she was
coming to New York for?

747
01:11:09,307 --> 01:11:12,728
Talk about it, think about it.
I had a plan to, uh, ease her into it,

748
01:11:12,811 --> 01:11:15,607
but I really...
I don't know how to do that.

749
01:11:21,321 --> 01:11:23,907
Oh, man.

750
01:11:28,036 --> 01:11:29,996
Who are these people?

751
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:35,961
Ordinary people under
extraordinary pressure, Mike.

752
01:11:37,755 --> 01:11:40,633
What the hell you expect,
grace and consistency?

753
01:12:09,081 --> 01:12:12,960
Five, four, three, two...

754
01:12:14,503 --> 01:12:16,713
You heard Mr. Sandefur say...

755
01:12:16,797 --> 01:12:21,385
before Congress that he believed
nicotine was not addictive.

756
01:12:21,468 --> 01:12:24,471
I believe Mr. Sandefur
perjured himself...

757
01:12:24,555 --> 01:12:26,474
because I watched those
testimonies very carefully.

758
01:12:26,558 --> 01:12:30,728
All of us did. I mean,
there was this whole line of people,

759
01:12:30,812 --> 01:12:33,356
whole line of C.E.O.'s
up there swearing.

760
01:12:33,398 --> 01:12:37,485
Part of the reason
I'm here is that l felt...

761
01:12:37,569 --> 01:12:39,946
that their representation
clearly misstated...

762
01:12:40,029 --> 01:12:41,948
at least within Brown &Williamson's
representation...

763
01:12:42,031 --> 01:12:46,370
clearly misstated what is common
language within the company.

764
01:12:46,412 --> 01:12:48,831
We are in
the nicotine delivery business.

765
01:12:48,914 --> 01:12:51,000
And that's what
cigarettes are for.

766
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:53,336
Delivery device for nicotine.

767
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:55,338
A delivery device
for nicotine.

768
01:12:55,422 --> 01:12:58,216
Put it in your mouth, light it up
and you're going to get your fix.

769
01:12:58,258 --> 01:13:02,722
- You're gonna get your fix.
- You're saying that Brown &Williamson...

770
01:13:02,763 --> 01:13:05,892
manipulates and adjusts
the nicotine fix...

771
01:13:05,975 --> 01:13:07,935
not by artificially
adding nicotine,

772
01:13:07,977 --> 01:13:11,022
but by enhancing
the effect of nicotine...

773
01:13:11,105 --> 01:13:15,526
through the use
of chemical elements such as ammonia.

774
01:13:15,610 --> 01:13:18,279
The process is known
as impact boosting.

775
01:13:18,362 --> 01:13:21,074
While not spiking nicotine,

776
01:13:21,116 --> 01:13:24,077
they clearly manipulate it.

777
01:13:24,119 --> 01:13:28,540
There is extensive use of this
technology, known as ammonia chemistry.

778
01:13:28,624 --> 01:13:32,169
It allows for the nicotine to be
more rapidly absorbed in the lung...

779
01:13:32,252 --> 01:13:34,922
and therefore affect the brain
and central nervous system.

780
01:13:39,177 --> 01:13:42,805
The straw that broke the camel's back for me
and really put me in trouble with Sandefur...

781
01:13:42,889 --> 01:13:45,559
was a compound called coumarin.

782
01:13:45,643 --> 01:13:47,561
When I came on board
at B&,

783
01:13:47,645 --> 01:13:52,358
they had tried to transition
from coumarin to a similar flavor...

784
01:13:52,441 --> 01:13:56,071
that would give the same taste
and had been unsuccessful.

785
01:13:56,154 --> 01:13:59,783
I wanted it out immediately.
I was told...

786
01:13:59,824 --> 01:14:03,870
that it would effect sales, so
I should mind my own business.

787
01:14:03,954 --> 01:14:06,998
I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur
indicating I could not in conscience...

788
01:14:07,082 --> 01:14:09,793
continue with coumarin
in a product that we now knew...

789
01:14:09,876 --> 01:14:14,340
we had documentation... was similar to
coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen.

790
01:14:14,423 --> 01:14:17,176
And you sent the document
forward to Sandefur?

791
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:19,178
I sent the document
forward to Sandefur.

792
01:14:19,262 --> 01:14:22,640
I was told that we would
continue to work on a substitute.

793
01:14:22,723 --> 01:14:26,519
We weren't going to remove it as it would
impact sales and that that was his decision.

794
01:14:26,602 --> 01:14:29,272
ln other words,
you are charging Sandefur...

795
01:14:29,355 --> 01:14:31,275
and Brown &Williamson...

796
01:14:31,358 --> 01:14:33,694
with ignoring health
considerations consciously?

797
01:14:36,196 --> 01:14:38,992
- Most certainly.
- And on March 24,

798
01:14:39,033 --> 01:14:42,745
Thomas Sandefur,
C.E.O. Of Brown &Williamson,

799
01:14:42,829 --> 01:14:45,164
had you fired.

800
01:14:46,791 --> 01:14:48,711
And the reason
he gave you?

801
01:14:50,713 --> 01:14:52,923
Poor communication skills.

802
01:14:55,050 --> 01:14:58,679
And you wish
you hadn't come forward?

803
01:14:58,721 --> 01:15:01,348
You wish you hadn't
blown the whistle?

804
01:15:02,933 --> 01:15:05,394
Yeah, there are times
I wish I hadn't done it.

805
01:15:07,272 --> 01:15:10,525
There are times I feel com...
Compelled to do it.

806
01:15:12,485 --> 01:15:14,446
If you'd asked me...

807
01:15:14,529 --> 01:15:17,157
would I do it again,
do I think it's worth it?

808
01:15:21,036 --> 01:15:23,079
Yeah, I think it's worth it.

809
01:15:56,282 --> 01:15:59,410
- Hi.
- Hi.

810
01:15:59,494 --> 01:16:01,872
My name is Jeff Wigand.

811
01:16:04,416 --> 01:16:06,752
You can call me, uh,
Mr. Wigand.

812
01:16:06,835 --> 01:16:08,754
You can call me
Dr. Wigand.

813
01:16:08,837 --> 01:16:12,383
I have a Ph. D. in biochemistry
and endocrinology.

814
01:16:12,466 --> 01:16:15,219
You can call me Jeff.

815
01:16:16,971 --> 01:16:19,724
Anything else you want to call me,
you'll have to do so in private.

816
01:16:19,766 --> 01:16:23,563
Um, okay.

817
01:16:23,604 --> 01:16:25,856
I find chemistry
to be magical.

818
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:28,067
I find it an adventure.

819
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:32,530
An exploration into the building
blocks of our physical universe.

820
01:16:32,613 --> 01:16:35,074
So how many of you have
taken chemistry before?

821
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:41,081
Okay. I've never taught it
before, so we're gonna be fine.

822
01:16:41,164 --> 01:16:43,917
Our first experiment
is gonna be measuring...

823
01:16:44,001 --> 01:16:46,044
the molecular weight
of butane.

824
01:16:48,088 --> 01:16:50,716
He's on line three.

825
01:16:54,137 --> 01:16:57,932
- Hello?
- Mr. Scruggs? Jeff Wigand.

826
01:16:57,974 --> 01:17:00,101
Lowell Bergman said
I should give you a call.

827
01:17:00,143 --> 01:17:02,645
My co-counsel,
Ron Motley and l,

828
01:17:02,729 --> 01:17:06,149
have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco
industry on behalf of the state of Mississippi...

829
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:08,735
to get the state
reimbursed Medicaid costs...

830
01:17:08,818 --> 01:17:11,405
for treatin' people
with smoking-related illness.

831
01:17:12,616 --> 01:17:14,618
If you'd be interested
in talkin' to us,

832
01:17:14,701 --> 01:17:17,078
we'd certainly like
to talk to you.

833
01:17:18,997 --> 01:17:20,832
When should we do this?

834
01:17:44,565 --> 01:17:47,027
Who the hell are you?
What are you doing in my house?

835
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:49,655
- It's okay, Jeff. It's okay.
- Mr. Wigand, you need to speak to...

836
01:17:49,738 --> 01:17:54,034
You've got
your own security now.

837
01:17:56,328 --> 01:17:58,580
You know, Lowell,
I can't... I can't afford to...

838
01:17:58,664 --> 01:18:02,834
No, they volunteered.
A friend owns a large security company.

839
01:18:02,876 --> 01:18:06,006
How're you doing, Mr. Wigand?
I'm John Telafarro.

840
01:18:06,048 --> 01:18:08,968
There'll be three of us
on the detail.

841
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:13,055
I'm going to the store. Please explain
our new house guests to your children.

842
01:18:14,848 --> 01:18:18,227
Mrs. Wigand's leaving the house.

843
01:18:21,397 --> 01:18:25,193
Uh, I called Richard Scruggs
in Mississippi.

844
01:18:25,235 --> 01:18:29,698
- I heard.
- I'm gonna be a witness for them in their litigation.

845
01:18:31,783 --> 01:18:34,327
So I'm gonna fly to Pascagoula,
give a deposition.

846
01:18:34,411 --> 01:18:36,580
I know. I'm gonna
go there tonight.

847
01:18:38,498 --> 01:18:41,210
You all right?

848
01:18:41,294 --> 01:18:43,838
- Did you have a good day?
- Yes, I did. I had a great day.

849
01:18:43,921 --> 01:18:46,507
- Uh, coffee, Lowell?
- Yeah, all right.

850
01:18:46,591 --> 01:18:48,926
Wanna play that game
we were playing before?

851
01:18:48,968 --> 01:18:51,804
You know, I think you
got it up to five.

852
01:18:51,887 --> 01:18:54,265
I was ahead of you,
and then you just...

853
01:19:14,704 --> 01:19:18,417
- Please don't wash your hands
in the sink.

854
01:19:18,459 --> 01:19:21,545
Where should I wash them?

855
01:19:21,629 --> 01:19:24,089
Use the bathroom.

856
01:19:24,131 --> 01:19:26,091
What's the difference?

857
01:19:26,133 --> 01:19:28,093
That's for food.

858
01:19:41,566 --> 01:19:44,653
Leave it on.
Just leave it on! Okay?

859
01:20:41,881 --> 01:20:44,135
I don't think
I can do this.

860
01:20:50,349 --> 01:20:52,643
I want to stand by
my husband.

861
01:20:52,727 --> 01:20:55,062
I really do, Jeffrey,
but...

862
01:20:56,939 --> 01:20:59,358
I don't think I can
do this anymore.

863
01:21:02,654 --> 01:21:04,573
I am so sorry.

864
01:21:24,093 --> 01:21:26,930
Can we talk about this
when I get back?

865
01:21:32,436 --> 01:21:34,396
Yes, Jeffrey.

866
01:22:30,373 --> 01:22:33,335
It's okay.

867
01:22:46,056 --> 01:22:48,058
Jeff!

868
01:22:51,771 --> 01:22:53,732
You've been served.

869
01:23:06,245 --> 01:23:08,915
Now, what this one is is
a temporary restraining order,

870
01:23:08,998 --> 01:23:12,460
a gag order,
issued by a Kentucky court.

871
01:23:12,543 --> 01:23:15,130
Jeff Wigand,
Michael Moore.

872
01:23:15,213 --> 01:23:17,132
Good to meet you,
Dr. Wigand.

873
01:23:17,215 --> 01:23:19,217
Mike's our attorney general
down here.

874
01:23:19,259 --> 01:23:21,511
I was just explaining to Jeff
they got a Kentucky court...

875
01:23:21,595 --> 01:23:24,432
to issue a gag order
to stop his deposition today.

876
01:23:24,515 --> 01:23:26,643
- Right.
- Now,

877
01:23:26,726 --> 01:23:29,103
they tried to get
the Mississippi court to honor it,

878
01:23:29,145 --> 01:23:31,105
but the judge threw it out.

879
01:23:31,147 --> 01:23:35,944
However, for you, there is a more
perilous effect of the gag order.

880
01:23:36,027 --> 01:23:40,073
Dr. Wigand, you do understand
what can happen, don't you?

881
01:23:42,826 --> 01:23:47,081
I'm not free to testify...
Here.

882
01:23:47,122 --> 01:23:49,959
That's right. If you violate
the Kentucky order,

883
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,169
when you
step foot back in Kentucky...

884
01:23:52,253 --> 01:23:55,214
they can find you in contempt
and they can incarcerate you.

885
01:23:55,297 --> 01:23:57,216
And you ought to know that.

886
01:24:00,845 --> 01:24:03,139
- Jail.
- Possibly, yes.

887
01:24:03,223 --> 01:24:06,269
That is one of the possible consequences
of your testifying here today.

888
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:08,271
That's right.

889
01:24:13,359 --> 01:24:16,904
How does...
How does one go to jail?

890
01:24:16,988 --> 01:24:20,659
Wh-What does my family do?

891
01:24:20,701 --> 01:24:23,078
Go on welfare?

892
01:24:23,161 --> 01:24:26,415
If my wife has to work,
who's gonna look after the kids?

893
01:24:26,498 --> 01:24:28,959
Put food on the table?
I mean, my children need me.

894
01:24:29,042 --> 01:24:31,295
If l'm not teaching,
there's no medical.

895
01:24:31,336 --> 01:24:35,258
No medical, even on co-pay,
that's like... Tuition...

896
01:24:35,341 --> 01:24:38,219
Dr. Wigand, listen.

897
01:24:38,303 --> 01:24:40,722
You may not be able
to do this thing.

898
01:24:40,805 --> 01:24:43,516
As I understand from Dick,
you're our key witness,

899
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:47,020
and I hope
you don't withdraw.

900
01:24:47,103 --> 01:24:49,606
Um, I guess we'd all
understand if you did.

901
01:24:50,898 --> 01:24:52,985
Guys, I gotta go.
I'm gonna be late for court.

902
01:24:53,068 --> 01:24:56,447
I'll see y'all later.
Dr. Wigand, good luck.

903
01:25:06,374 --> 01:25:08,835
I know what you're facing,
Jeff.

904
01:25:08,918 --> 01:25:10,880
And I think I know
how you're feeling.

905
01:25:12,757 --> 01:25:17,053
In the navy, I flew
A-6's off carriers.

906
01:25:17,136 --> 01:25:20,598
In combat, events have
a duration of seconds.

907
01:25:20,681 --> 01:25:23,017
Sometimes minutes.

908
01:25:23,059 --> 01:25:25,937
But what you're going through
goes on day in, day out,

909
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:28,189
whether you're
ready for it or not.

910
01:25:28,230 --> 01:25:30,192
Week in, week out.

911
01:25:30,233 --> 01:25:32,903
Month after month
after month.

912
01:25:32,986 --> 01:25:36,531
Whether you're up
or whether you're down.

913
01:25:36,573 --> 01:25:39,534
You're assaulted
psychologically.

914
01:25:39,576 --> 01:25:41,912
You're assaulted
financially,

915
01:25:41,995 --> 01:25:46,668
which is its own special kind of violence
because it's directed at your kids.

916
01:25:46,751 --> 01:25:49,088
What school can you afford?

917
01:25:49,129 --> 01:25:51,632
How will that
affect their lives?

918
01:25:51,715 --> 01:25:53,634
You're asking yourself,

919
01:25:53,717 --> 01:25:57,012
"Will that limit
what they may become?"

920
01:25:57,096 --> 01:25:59,765
You feel your whole family's future
is compromised,

921
01:25:59,848 --> 01:26:02,393
held hostage.

922
01:26:02,476 --> 01:26:04,604
I do know how it is.

923
01:26:19,077 --> 01:26:20,996
You attract a crowd.

924
01:26:21,079 --> 01:26:22,999
Yeah.
Great.

925
01:26:24,959 --> 01:26:28,004
I heard about
the Kentucky gag order.

926
01:26:31,674 --> 01:26:34,135
I don't know what to do.

927
01:27:36,536 --> 01:27:39,831
Hold on a second.

928
01:27:39,915 --> 01:27:44,002
Would you please ask Mr. Motley if he
expects his witness to appear or not?

929
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:14,618
I can't seem to find
the criteria to decide.

930
01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:19,915
It's too big a decision to make
without being resolved in my own mind.

931
01:28:22,251 --> 01:28:25,255
Maybe things have changed.

932
01:28:46,445 --> 01:28:48,405
A lot's changed.

933
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:55,621
You mean since this morning?

934
01:28:57,956 --> 01:29:01,168
No, I mean since whenever.

935
01:29:07,383 --> 01:29:09,802
Fuck it.

936
01:29:09,844 --> 01:29:12,013
Let's go to court.

937
01:29:12,096 --> 01:29:14,767
Dr. Wigand would like to leave now.

938
01:31:39,463 --> 01:31:41,883
Okay, Jeff. I'm gonna sit you down
at that table over there.

939
01:31:41,967 --> 01:31:43,885
I want to start
as fast as possible.

940
01:31:43,969 --> 01:31:46,346
I don't want to give them a chance to
get another restraining order. Okay?

941
01:31:46,429 --> 01:31:48,348
- Let's go.
- Good luck, Doc.

942
01:31:56,607 --> 01:32:00,278
Please stand.
Raise your right hand.

943
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:04,449
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

944
01:32:04,533 --> 01:32:07,703
- l do.
- You may be seated.

945
01:32:07,786 --> 01:32:10,580
You understand, Dr. Wigand,
you are under oath?

946
01:32:10,664 --> 01:32:14,668
This is a sworn deposition.
There's no judge. It's not a trial.

947
01:32:14,751 --> 01:32:17,922
Will you state your name
for the record?

948
01:32:18,006 --> 01:32:21,467
Jeffrey S. Wigand.
R-E-Y. W-l-G-A-N-D.

949
01:32:24,971 --> 01:32:27,432
Got any idea what's
going on in there?

950
01:32:27,473 --> 01:32:29,434
No, I don't have
a clue.

951
01:32:31,644 --> 01:32:34,105
- That is correct.
- In other words, it acts as a drug,

952
01:32:34,188 --> 01:32:36,442
- Object to the form of the question.
- It acts as a drug...

953
01:32:36,525 --> 01:32:38,360
- Object to the form...
- It acts as a drug...

954
01:32:38,444 --> 01:32:40,529
- Object!
- Is there an echo in here?

955
01:32:40,612 --> 01:32:42,615
Your objection's been recorded.

956
01:32:42,699 --> 01:32:45,869
She typed it into her little machine
ower there. It's on there cord.

957
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:50,415
So now l'll proceed
with my deposition of my witness.

958
01:32:52,334 --> 01:32:55,630
- Does it act as a drug?
- Dr. Wigand!

959
01:32:55,713 --> 01:32:58,257
I am instructing you...

960
01:32:58,299 --> 01:33:00,718
not to answer that question.

961
01:33:00,801 --> 01:33:04,430
In accordance to the terms of
the contractual obligations...

962
01:33:04,472 --> 01:33:07,016
under taken by you...

963
01:33:07,099 --> 01:33:10,144
not to disclose
any information...

964
01:33:10,227 --> 01:33:13,940
about your work at the Brown
&Williamson Tobacco Company.

965
01:33:13,982 --> 01:33:17,235
And in accordance
with the force and effect...

966
01:33:17,319 --> 01:33:19,404
of the temporary
restraining order...

967
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:21,615
that has been
entered against you...

968
01:33:21,698 --> 01:33:25,577
by the court
in the state of Kentucky.

969
01:33:25,661 --> 01:33:28,289
That means you don't talk.

970
01:33:28,373 --> 01:33:30,416
Mr. Motley, we have rights here.

971
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:32,794
Oh, you've got rights.

972
01:33:32,835 --> 01:33:36,840
And lefts.
Ups and downs and middles.

973
01:33:36,924 --> 01:33:41,637
So what? You don't get
to instruct anything around here!

974
01:33:41,679 --> 01:33:46,017
This is not North Carolina,
not South Carolina, nor Kentucky.

975
01:33:46,059 --> 01:33:49,479
This is the sovereign state
of Mississippi's proceeding.

976
01:33:49,521 --> 01:33:52,357
Wipe that smirk off your face!

977
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:56,361
Dr. Wigand's deposition
will be part of this record!

978
01:33:56,403 --> 01:34:00,448
And I'm gonna take my witness' testimony
whether the hell you like it or not!

979
01:34:14,505 --> 01:34:16,424
Answer the question,
Doctor.

980
01:34:16,507 --> 01:34:21,680
Yes. It produces a physiological response,
which meets the definition of a drug.

981
01:34:21,763 --> 01:34:25,018
Um, nicotine
is associated with...

982
01:34:25,059 --> 01:34:27,520
impact, satisfaction.

983
01:34:27,562 --> 01:34:32,150
It has a pharmacological effect that
crosses the blood-brain barrier intact.

984
01:34:35,069 --> 01:34:37,947
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.

985
01:35:21,787 --> 01:35:24,247
One of the reasons
I'm here is that I felt...

986
01:35:24,289 --> 01:35:27,584
that their representation
clearly...

987
01:35:29,795 --> 01:35:33,967
Run that Sandefur piece
on "nicotine's not addictive."

988
01:35:34,050 --> 01:35:37,637
Run that on camera, then cut right to
Wigand with "l believe they perjured..."

989
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:40,556
Then go wide to the C.E.O.s
all taking the oath.

990
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:43,559
Then back on Jeff...

991
01:35:43,643 --> 01:35:46,229
and play the pause after
the word "felt" on the B-side.

992
01:35:46,312 --> 01:35:49,607
Hell of a show, Mike.
Explosive material.

993
01:35:51,694 --> 01:35:54,446
- It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
- Good.

994
01:35:55,698 --> 01:35:57,783
- I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
- Yeah.

995
01:35:57,825 --> 01:36:01,161
They argued that he was going to reveal
the secret formula of Kools to the world.

996
01:36:03,831 --> 01:36:06,291
Sealeddoesn'thurtScruggs'litigation,

997
01:36:06,333 --> 01:36:09,964
and since we're the only ones with the story,
l believe we're sitting on an exclusive.

998
01:36:10,006 --> 01:36:12,425
- I like that.
Corporate has some questions.

999
01:36:12,508 --> 01:36:14,844
We've got a meeting at "Black Rock "
first thing in the morning.

1000
01:36:14,927 --> 01:36:18,973
- When's the air date?
- Lowell, Sharon's online three.

1001
01:36:19,015 --> 01:36:23,144
- Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
- Here we go.

1002
01:36:23,185 --> 01:36:25,688
That they had long
known that the nicotine in tobacco...

1003
01:36:25,730 --> 01:36:30,027
is an addictive drug despite their
public statements to the contrary.

1004
01:36:30,110 --> 01:36:33,864
Like the testimony before Congress
of Dr. Wigand's former boss,

1005
01:36:33,947 --> 01:36:37,909
Brown &Williamson's chief
executive officer, Thomas Sandefur.

1006
01:36:37,993 --> 01:36:40,495
I believe that nicotine
is not addictive.

1007
01:36:40,579 --> 01:36:43,165
I believe Mr. Sandefur
perjured himself...

1008
01:36:43,206 --> 01:36:45,710
because I watched those
testimonies very carefully.

1009
01:36:45,752 --> 01:36:49,255
All of us did.
There was this whole line of people,

1010
01:36:49,339 --> 01:36:51,758
whole line of C.E.O.'s
up there all swearing.

1011
01:36:51,841 --> 01:36:54,510
Part of the reason
I'm here is that I felt...

1012
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:57,805
that their representation
clearly misstated...

1013
01:36:57,889 --> 01:37:00,142
what is common language
within the company.

1014
01:37:00,225 --> 01:37:02,479
We are in the nicotine
delivery business.

1015
01:37:02,562 --> 01:37:06,066
There is extensive use of this
technology, known as ammonia chemistry.

1016
01:37:06,149 --> 01:37:10,070
It allows for the nicotine to be
more rapidly absorbed in the lung...

1017
01:37:10,111 --> 01:37:12,781
and therefore affect the brain
and central nervous system.

1018
01:37:12,864 --> 01:37:15,909
That's what cigarettes are for.
- Delivery device for nicotine.

1019
01:37:15,992 --> 01:37:18,870
A delivery device
for nicotine. Put it in your mouth,

1020
01:37:18,912 --> 01:37:21,040
Iight it up and
you're going to get your fix.

1021
01:37:21,082 --> 01:37:23,417
You're going to get your fix.

1022
01:40:27,574 --> 01:40:30,535
- Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
- No, we're fine.

1023
01:40:30,618 --> 01:40:33,413
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1024
01:40:33,496 --> 01:40:35,791
All right. I thought
we'd get together...

1025
01:40:35,833 --> 01:40:37,793
because there's
a legal concept...

1026
01:40:37,835 --> 01:40:40,546
that has been getting
some new attention recently.

1027
01:40:40,629 --> 01:40:42,715
Tortious interference.

1028
01:40:42,798 --> 01:40:46,594
If two people have an agreement,
like a confidentiality agreement,

1029
01:40:46,677 --> 01:40:51,140
and one of them breaks it because they
are induced to do so by a third party,

1030
01:40:51,182 --> 01:40:54,311
the third party can be sued
for damages for interfering.

1031
01:40:54,353 --> 01:40:56,563
Hence, tortious interference.

1032
01:40:56,646 --> 01:40:59,775
"lnterfering"?
That's what we do.

1033
01:40:59,858 --> 01:41:02,569
I think what we're trying to tell you
is that it happens all the time.

1034
01:41:02,652 --> 01:41:06,657
This is a news organization. People are
always telling us things they shouldn't.

1035
01:41:06,740 --> 01:41:10,995
We have to verify if it's true and in the
public interest. And if it is, we air it.

1036
01:41:11,037 --> 01:41:15,375
And after we corroborate it. That's why we've
never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show.

1037
01:41:15,458 --> 01:41:20,255
- Anything else?
- And 60 Minutes' verification is exact and precise.

1038
01:41:20,339 --> 01:41:24,218
And I don't think it would hurt
to make sure you're right on this one.

1039
01:41:24,301 --> 01:41:28,223
Why? You think we have liability?

1040
01:41:28,306 --> 01:41:30,392
What's the CBS News position,
Eric?

1041
01:41:30,475 --> 01:41:32,644
There's a possibility.
It's rather remote.

1042
01:41:32,727 --> 01:41:35,689
But one we
have to check on, Mike.

1043
01:41:35,772 --> 01:41:38,358
I've retained outside counsel
to do exactly that...

1044
01:41:38,441 --> 01:41:43,029
on a segment, I might add,
that's already rife with problems.

1045
01:41:43,113 --> 01:41:45,073
What does that mean?
" Rife with..."

1046
01:41:45,115 --> 01:41:48,369
I'm told unusual promises
were made to Wigand.

1047
01:41:48,452 --> 01:41:51,539
No, only that we would hold his story
until it was safe for him.

1048
01:41:51,622 --> 01:41:54,709
And I'm told there are questions
as to our star witness' veracity.

1049
01:41:54,792 --> 01:41:57,795
His "veracity" was good enough
for the state of Mississippi.

1050
01:41:57,878 --> 01:42:00,339
Our standards have to be
higher than anyone else's,

1051
01:42:00,423 --> 01:42:03,384
because we are the standard
for everybody else.

1052
01:42:03,468 --> 01:42:08,640
Well, as a "standard," I'll hang with
"is this guy telling the truth?"

1053
01:42:08,724 --> 01:42:11,436
Well, with tortious interference,
I'm afraid...

1054
01:42:11,519 --> 01:42:15,023
the greater the truth,
the greater the damage.

1055
01:42:16,607 --> 01:42:19,027
- Come again?
- They own...

1056
01:42:19,110 --> 01:42:21,655
the information he's disclosing.

1057
01:42:21,739 --> 01:42:23,782
The truer it is,

1058
01:42:23,866 --> 01:42:25,868
the greater
the damage to them.

1059
01:42:25,951 --> 01:42:29,580
If he lied, he didn't disclose their
information, and the damages are smaller.

1060
01:42:34,668 --> 01:42:39,507
- Is this Alice in Wonderland?
- You said "on this one."

1061
01:42:39,591 --> 01:42:41,509
What about this one?

1062
01:42:41,593 --> 01:42:45,263
If this holds up...
And it very well may not, Mike.

1063
01:42:45,347 --> 01:42:48,641
But if it did
and we aired this segment,

1064
01:42:48,725 --> 01:42:52,771
and CBS was sued
by Brown &Williamson,

1065
01:42:52,812 --> 01:42:54,898
I think we could be
at grave risk.

1066
01:42:54,981 --> 01:42:58,778
- How grave?
- Well, at the end of the day,

1067
01:42:58,819 --> 01:43:01,531
because of your segment,

1068
01:43:01,615 --> 01:43:04,034
the Brown &Williamson
Tobacco Company...

1069
01:43:04,117 --> 01:43:06,119
could own CBS.

1070
01:43:08,246 --> 01:43:11,166
Oh. You know,

1071
01:43:11,208 --> 01:43:15,171
I am sorry,
but I'm due upstairs.

1072
01:43:15,254 --> 01:43:18,216
Is CBS Corporate
telling CBS News...

1073
01:43:18,299 --> 01:43:21,803
" Do not go to air
with this story"?

1074
01:43:21,844 --> 01:43:24,472
You're getting ahead of yourself.
We're all in this together.

1075
01:43:24,555 --> 01:43:27,767
We're all CBS.
We'll find out soon.

1076
01:43:27,850 --> 01:43:29,769
Thank you, gentlemen.

1077
01:43:36,819 --> 01:43:38,779
"Tortious interference."

1078
01:43:38,862 --> 01:43:41,907
That sounds like a disease
caught by a radio.

1079
01:43:41,990 --> 01:43:44,410
- Lunch?
- Sure.

1080
01:43:44,493 --> 01:43:46,870
Don't worry.
We call the shots around here.

1081
01:44:00,469 --> 01:44:02,847
Hello?

1082
01:44:02,888 --> 01:44:05,725
Debbie, it's me. I want
you to check some filings,

1083
01:44:05,808 --> 01:44:08,311
and give me John Wilson's number
at Bear-Stearn.

1084
01:44:16,570 --> 01:44:19,031
- What now?
- Kluster's coming over.

1085
01:44:26,706 --> 01:44:28,666
Hello, Lowell, Mike.

1086
01:44:28,750 --> 01:44:31,085
Don.

1087
01:44:31,169 --> 01:44:35,506
There has been so much soul searching
about this Wigand.

1088
01:44:35,590 --> 01:44:39,010
I've decided we should cut an alternate
version of the show without his interview.

1089
01:44:39,052 --> 01:44:39,802
I've decided we should cut an alternate
version of the show without his interview.

1090
01:44:39,844 --> 01:44:44,516
So what happened to Ms. Caperelli's
checking with outside counsel first?

1091
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:46,519
- All that crap?
- That's happening.

1092
01:44:46,603 --> 01:44:49,189
Hopefully, we won't have to use the
alternate, but we should have it in the can.

1093
01:44:49,272 --> 01:44:51,608
- I'm not touching my film.
- I'm afraid you are.

1094
01:44:51,691 --> 01:44:55,820
- No, I'm not.
- We're doing this with or with out you, Lowell.

1095
01:44:55,904 --> 01:44:59,866
If you like, I can assign
another producer to edit your show.

1096
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:04,038
Since when has the, uh,

1097
01:45:04,121 --> 01:45:07,541
paragon of
investigative journalism...

1098
01:45:07,583 --> 01:45:11,837
allowed lawyers to determine
the news content on 60 Minutes?

1099
01:45:11,921 --> 01:45:14,256
It's an alternate version.

1100
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:17,009
So what if we have
an alternate version?

1101
01:45:17,093 --> 01:45:19,721
And I don't think our being cautious
is so damned unreasonable.

1102
01:45:21,056 --> 01:45:23,016
So now, if you will
excuse me, gentlemen,

1103
01:45:23,058 --> 01:45:25,686
Mr. Rather's been complaining
about his chair again.

1104
01:45:25,727 --> 01:45:28,563
Before you go,

1105
01:45:29,648 --> 01:45:31,608
I discovered this.

1106
01:45:33,568 --> 01:45:38,158
S.E.C. Filing for the sale of CBS
Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.

1107
01:45:38,242 --> 01:45:40,494
- What?
- Yeah, I heard rumors.

1108
01:45:40,577 --> 01:45:43,706
It's not a rumor. It's a sale.
If Tisch can unload CBS...

1109
01:45:43,747 --> 01:45:46,083
for $81 a share
to Westinghouse,

1110
01:45:46,166 --> 01:45:48,127
and then is
suddenly threatened...

1111
01:45:48,210 --> 01:45:51,964
with a multi-billion dollar
lawsuit from Brown &Williamson,

1112
01:45:52,047 --> 01:45:53,966
that could screw up the sale,
could it not?

1113
01:45:54,049 --> 01:45:57,971
- What are you implying?
- I'm not implying. I'm quoting.

1114
01:45:58,054 --> 01:46:01,933
Uh, " More vested interests. Persons
who will profit from this merger.

1115
01:46:02,017 --> 01:46:07,230
" Ms. Helen Caperelli, general counsel
of CBS News, 3.9 million.

1116
01:46:07,313 --> 01:46:10,400
" Mr. Eric Kluster,
president of CBS News,

1117
01:46:10,442 --> 01:46:13,320
1.4 million."

1118
01:46:13,404 --> 01:46:16,532
Are you suggesting that
she and Eric are influenced by money?

1119
01:46:16,615 --> 01:46:20,619
No, no, of course they're not
influenced by money. They work for free.

1120
01:46:20,703 --> 01:46:23,122
And you are a volunteer
executive producer.

1121
01:46:23,205 --> 01:46:27,126
CBS does not do that. And you're
questioning our journalistic integrity.

1122
01:46:27,209 --> 01:46:29,129
No, I'm questioning
your hearing.

1123
01:46:29,212 --> 01:46:31,507
You hear "reasonable"
and "tortious interference."

1124
01:46:31,591 --> 01:46:34,761
I hear "potential Brown
&Williamson lawsuit...

1125
01:46:34,844 --> 01:46:37,847
jeopardizing the sale
of CBS to Westinghouse."

1126
01:46:37,930 --> 01:46:41,309
I hear "Shut the segment down.
Cut Wigand loose.

1127
01:46:41,392 --> 01:46:44,187
Obey orders and fuck off."
That's what I hear.

1128
01:46:44,270 --> 01:46:46,189
- You're exaggerating.
- I am?

1129
01:46:46,272 --> 01:46:49,068
You pay me
to go get guys like Wigand,

1130
01:46:49,151 --> 01:46:52,988
to draw him out, to get him to trust
us, to get him to go on television.

1131
01:46:53,030 --> 01:46:55,949
I do. I deliver him.
He sits. He talks.

1132
01:46:55,991 --> 01:46:59,370
He violates his own fucking
confidentiality agreement.

1133
01:46:59,453 --> 01:47:03,499
And he's only the key witness in the
biggest public health reform issue,

1134
01:47:03,582 --> 01:47:05,668
maybe the biggest,
most expensive...

1135
01:47:05,752 --> 01:47:08,671
corporate malfeasance case
in U.S. History.

1136
01:47:08,755 --> 01:47:11,091
And Jeffrey Wigand,
who's out on a limb,

1137
01:47:11,174 --> 01:47:13,510
does he go on television
and tell the truth?

1138
01:47:13,593 --> 01:47:15,929
Yes.
Is it newsworthy?

1139
01:47:16,012 --> 01:47:18,682
Yes.
Are we gonna air it?

1140
01:47:18,765 --> 01:47:20,768
Of course not. Why?

1141
01:47:20,851 --> 01:47:23,104
Because he's not
telling the truth? No.

1142
01:47:23,187 --> 01:47:27,025
Because he is telling the truth.
That's why we're not gonna air it.

1143
01:47:27,067 --> 01:47:29,361
And the more truth he tells,
the worse it gets.

1144
01:47:29,444 --> 01:47:33,365
You are a fanatic,
an anarchist. You know that?

1145
01:47:33,448 --> 01:47:36,993
If we can't have a whole show, then
I want half a show rather than no show.

1146
01:47:37,035 --> 01:47:40,831
But, oh, no. Not you. You won't be satisfied
unless you're putting the company at risk!

1147
01:47:40,872 --> 01:47:44,127
What are you? Are you a businessman
or are you a newsman?

1148
01:47:44,210 --> 01:47:46,546
Because that happens to be
what Mike and l...

1149
01:47:46,629 --> 01:47:49,257
and some other people
around here do for a living.

1150
01:47:49,340 --> 01:47:52,927
- Lowell...
- Put the corporation at risk? Give me a fucking break!

1151
01:47:53,010 --> 01:47:55,179
These people are
putting our whole reason...

1152
01:47:55,221 --> 01:47:57,890
- for doing what we do on the line!
- Lowell!

1153
01:47:57,974 --> 01:48:00,019
What?

1154
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:02,271
I'm with Don
on this.

1155
01:48:24,754 --> 01:48:26,714
What's wrong?

1156
01:48:26,756 --> 01:48:29,341
They're killing
the Wigand interview.

1157
01:48:29,425 --> 01:48:33,679
- What?
- They're pretending it's process. That's bullshit. It's foregone.

1158
01:48:37,100 --> 01:48:39,019
What are you and Mike
gonna do?

1159
01:48:41,813 --> 01:48:44,441
I'm alone on this.

1160
01:48:45,525 --> 01:48:47,861
- Oh, baby.
- Yeah.

1161
01:49:17,060 --> 01:49:18,978
It's Jeffrey Wigand.

1162
01:49:28,781 --> 01:49:32,243
Jeffrey.
How are you?

1163
01:49:32,326 --> 01:49:34,453
How's the family?
Okay?

1164
01:49:34,537 --> 01:49:37,498
- There is... There is no family.
- What do you mean, "there is no family"?

1165
01:49:37,540 --> 01:49:39,834
Uh, Liane has filed for divorce.

1166
01:49:39,917 --> 01:49:43,254
And, so,
I've moved out.

1167
01:49:43,337 --> 01:49:45,882
I see the girls
a couple of days a week.

1168
01:49:45,966 --> 01:49:51,346
- Where are you staying now?
- Our favorite hotel, honey.

1169
01:49:51,388 --> 01:49:55,476
I checked into room 930.

1170
01:49:55,560 --> 01:49:57,520
Odd choice, huh?

1171
01:50:01,315 --> 01:50:03,527
I don't know how
to say this,

1172
01:50:03,610 --> 01:50:05,988
Jeff, except to just
say it right out.

1173
01:50:06,030 --> 01:50:10,284
So, uh, I'll say it.
They do not want to air it.

1174
01:50:12,161 --> 01:50:17,291
- What?
- B& may have threatened litigation.

1175
01:50:17,374 --> 01:50:19,918
CBS is on the block.

1176
01:50:20,002 --> 01:50:23,131
- But you, I mean... I know how you...
- No.

1177
01:50:24,215 --> 01:50:26,342
No, what?

1178
01:50:26,426 --> 01:50:31,181
I do not think that you know for me
what it is to walk in my shoes.

1179
01:50:32,974 --> 01:50:36,061
For my kids
to have seen it,

1180
01:50:36,144 --> 01:50:39,023
for them to know why I've
put them through what I did.

1181
01:50:39,065 --> 01:50:42,693
The public airing of that,
the testament to why I did what I did.

1182
01:50:42,735 --> 01:50:45,738
You're telling me it's not
gonna see the light of day?

1183
01:50:45,780 --> 01:50:48,533
Jeff.

1184
01:51:31,203 --> 01:51:33,123
Mrs. Wigand?

1185
01:51:34,874 --> 01:51:38,087
It hasn't been Mrs. Wigand
for some time.

1186
01:51:38,129 --> 01:51:42,800
I'm an investigator, and I was wondering if l
could ask you a couple of questions about that.

1187
01:51:44,677 --> 01:51:46,637
All right.

1188
01:51:50,559 --> 01:51:53,103
Um, seven months
after we were married,

1189
01:51:53,186 --> 01:51:55,605
we found out that I had
multiple sclerosis.

1190
01:51:55,689 --> 01:51:57,607
And you had a daughter, Diane...

1191
01:51:59,693 --> 01:52:04,156
He's not going to allow Brown &Williamson
to be demonized to the American public.

1192
01:52:04,197 --> 01:52:07,200
So I told Peter Jennings.
And l... Hold on.

1193
01:52:07,284 --> 01:52:10,913
You had multiple sclerosis.
You had a small child to raise.

1194
01:52:10,997 --> 01:52:15,043
Uh, mention that part in the
executive summary and in the chapters.

1195
01:52:15,126 --> 01:52:17,545
First wife
and estrangement of daughter.

1196
01:52:17,587 --> 01:52:20,048
So I was telling Pete, I said,
"You've been taken in by this guy."

1197
01:52:20,089 --> 01:52:22,842
The divorce was something
that we both wanted.

1198
01:52:23,926 --> 01:52:26,555
He's a shoplifter.

1199
01:52:26,638 --> 01:52:29,099
He's a convicted
shoplifter.

1200
01:52:47,703 --> 01:52:51,040
So, um, what are you
gonna do?

1201
01:52:51,082 --> 01:52:54,251
What do you think I'm gonna do?
Quit in protest?

1202
01:52:54,335 --> 01:52:56,587
I'm not gonna do that.

1203
01:52:56,629 --> 01:52:58,589
You're taking "no"
for an answer?

1204
01:52:58,631 --> 01:53:01,593
No, I'm not gonna take
"no" for an answer. No.

1205
01:53:01,676 --> 01:53:04,805
You're not?
What are you doing?

1206
01:53:04,888 --> 01:53:08,350
I'm staying right here, doing my job.
Fighting to get my show on the air.

1207
01:53:08,433 --> 01:53:11,103
You don't like it?
Hey, I tell you what?

1208
01:53:11,186 --> 01:53:14,231
Fire my ass.

1209
01:53:14,314 --> 01:53:18,110
End up in a high-profile lawsuit with
Lowell, the First Amendment martyr?

1210
01:53:21,448 --> 01:53:25,077
I don't think so.
Take a look at this.

1211
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:27,996
This is a summary of a dossier
that's being prepared.

1212
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:30,290
He wouldn't lie
about his whole life.

1213
01:53:30,374 --> 01:53:33,127
Who's gonna believe him
about anything he says?

1214
01:53:33,210 --> 01:53:37,006
The Wall Street Journal is doing
a major story, and, I think, the Post.

1215
01:53:38,091 --> 01:53:40,427
You backed the wrong horse.

1216
01:53:40,468 --> 01:53:44,806
The version without the interview
is gonna air the week after next.

1217
01:53:50,603 --> 01:53:53,606
What was that about?

1218
01:53:53,690 --> 01:53:55,735
- Get me Wigand.
- Sure.

1219
01:53:58,821 --> 01:54:02,533
What the fuck is this?
Fuck!

1220
01:54:02,616 --> 01:54:04,785
You never told me
you were married before.

1221
01:54:04,827 --> 01:54:08,122
- That you had a daughter.
- How is that any of your business?

1222
01:54:08,164 --> 01:54:10,583
That is not something
that you people need to know.

1223
01:54:10,666 --> 01:54:12,627
Oh, you know what we do
or do not need to know?

1224
01:54:12,669 --> 01:54:15,131
- Since when have you become a media expert?
- What do you wanna do, Lowell?

1225
01:54:15,173 --> 01:54:17,508
- Look up my ass too?
- Oh, for God's sake.

1226
01:54:17,550 --> 01:54:20,303
- You're not even on this anymore. What do you care?
- Jeff, wake the fuck up!

1227
01:54:20,344 --> 01:54:23,848
Everybody is on the line here.
If they catch you in a lie,

1228
01:54:23,931 --> 01:54:26,684
they can paint everything with
that brush, you understand?

1229
01:54:26,726 --> 01:54:29,228
- Everything you say.
- I told the truth.

1230
01:54:29,312 --> 01:54:32,816
Everything you say.
And I can't defend you, man,

1231
01:54:32,900 --> 01:54:34,943
with one hand tied
behind my back...

1232
01:54:35,027 --> 01:54:37,571
because you keep from me
what they can discover.

1233
01:54:37,654 --> 01:54:40,365
And they will discover
everything. Believe me.

1234
01:54:40,449 --> 01:54:42,618
I was young!
I was young!

1235
01:54:42,701 --> 01:54:45,704
Confused. We didn't
handle it the right way.

1236
01:54:45,788 --> 01:54:48,541
- She sued you for back payments of child support?
- She did not sue me.

1237
01:54:48,625 --> 01:54:53,755
We had a dispute over money. I settled
it. She dropped the complaint.

1238
01:54:53,838 --> 01:54:55,757
- Any other questions?
- Yes. Did you lie...

1239
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:58,051
about being on the American
judo team in the Olympics?

1240
01:54:59,177 --> 01:55:01,262
- What?
- Some public relations guy...

1241
01:55:01,346 --> 01:55:03,390
got hold of a tape of an interview
where you're saying...

1242
01:55:03,473 --> 01:55:06,019
you were on the American
judo team in the Olympics.

1243
01:55:06,103 --> 01:55:09,231
What kind of shit is this?
L... I was...

1244
01:55:09,314 --> 01:55:12,818
I was not on the team.
I sparred with the Olympic team.

1245
01:55:12,901 --> 01:55:15,904
- Okay?
- All right. ABC Telemarketing Company?

1246
01:55:15,987 --> 01:55:19,658
- ABC...
- ABC Telemarketing Company.

1247
01:55:19,741 --> 01:55:22,577
The can opener!
A 39.95 can opener!

1248
01:55:22,661 --> 01:55:25,373
I cancelled payment.
It was junk!

1249
01:55:25,415 --> 01:55:28,584
You ever bounce a check, Lowell?
You ever look at another woman's tits?

1250
01:55:28,668 --> 01:55:30,962
You ever cheat a little
on your taxes?

1251
01:55:31,045 --> 01:55:34,590
Whose life, if you look at it under
a microscope, doesn't have any flaws?

1252
01:55:34,674 --> 01:55:37,218
Well, that's the whole point, Jeffrey.
That's the whole point.

1253
01:55:37,260 --> 01:55:41,140
Anyone's, everyone's.
They are gonna look under every rock,

1254
01:55:41,223 --> 01:55:44,977
dig up every flaw,
every mistake you've ever made.

1255
01:55:45,060 --> 01:55:49,022
They are going to distort and exaggerate
everything you've ever done, man.

1256
01:55:49,106 --> 01:55:51,775
- Don't you understand?
- What does this have to do with my testimony?

1257
01:55:51,859 --> 01:55:54,027
- That's not the point...
- What does it have to do with my testimony?

1258
01:55:54,111 --> 01:55:56,823
- I told the truth! It's true and provable!
- It's not about...

1259
01:55:56,906 --> 01:56:00,286
That's not the fucking point,
whether you told the truth or not!

1260
01:56:01,829 --> 01:56:03,789
Hello?

1261
01:56:06,667 --> 01:56:09,044
I told the truth.

1262
01:56:10,755 --> 01:56:12,673
I told the truth.

1263
01:56:14,008 --> 01:56:16,595
I gotta teach class. I gotta go.

1264
01:56:16,636 --> 01:56:20,432
- I gotta teach class.
- And I gotta refute every fucking accusation made...

1265
01:56:20,474 --> 01:56:23,351
in this report before
the WalI Street Journal runs.

1266
01:56:27,189 --> 01:56:29,274
I am trying to protect you,
man.

1267
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:32,319
I hope you improve
your batting average.

1268
01:56:51,799 --> 01:56:55,136
They're cutting the interestrate,
and l have that great feature...

1269
01:57:01,476 --> 01:57:03,395
- Hello?
- It's Lowell.

1270
01:57:03,478 --> 01:57:08,108
Are you guys planning to do a piece on
a former top executive in Big Tobacco?

1271
01:57:08,191 --> 01:57:11,028
- You caught me in a news meeting.
- Are you, are you not, Charlie?

1272
01:57:11,070 --> 01:57:13,072
You bet we are,
and I can't talk to you now.

1273
01:57:13,155 --> 01:57:16,075
- We gotta hook up.
- Sure. Where?

1274
01:57:16,158 --> 01:57:19,036
- P.J.'s.
- I'll be there.

1275
01:57:26,085 --> 01:57:28,713
Yeah, I got it.
Five hundred pages of it.

1276
01:57:28,797 --> 01:57:32,426
They looked in every corner of this
guy's life, from the spousal abuse charge,

1277
01:57:32,509 --> 01:57:36,179
to shoplifting, to a traffic ticket
he got once for running a red light.

1278
01:57:36,263 --> 01:57:39,809
It's Terry Lenzner's outfit,
l. G.I. Jack, listen to me.

1279
01:57:39,892 --> 01:57:44,480
Their strategy: discredit this guy, ruin
his reputation in the WalI Street Journal...

1280
01:57:44,564 --> 01:57:47,943
and then nobody will ever listen
to what he's got to say about tobacco.

1281
01:57:48,026 --> 01:57:51,155
He's dead unless I can
get this thing knocked down.

1282
01:57:51,238 --> 01:57:53,657
Make it even
a little more attractive.

1283
01:57:53,741 --> 01:57:56,326
I don't know if you're
ever gonna get paid.

1284
01:57:56,410 --> 01:57:58,996
- Is there any truth to any of it?
- That's a good question.

1285
01:57:59,079 --> 01:58:01,457
"ls there any truth to any of it?"
I doubt it.

1286
01:58:01,540 --> 01:58:05,003
- What's the deadline?
- Soon.

1287
01:58:08,923 --> 01:58:11,760
- Fax me the summary.
- That's great, Jack.

1288
01:58:18,475 --> 01:58:22,063
- Hey. How are you? Hey, listen.
- Hey.

1289
01:58:22,104 --> 01:58:25,441
I hear you guys are sitting
on something sensational over there.

1290
01:58:25,483 --> 01:58:29,070
- Really? Hi, June.
- Oh, hi, baby.

1291
01:58:30,863 --> 01:58:32,991
- Catch you later.
- Okay. Take care.

1292
01:58:34,826 --> 01:58:36,787
- When's your deadline?
- Monday.

1293
01:58:36,828 --> 01:58:39,791
- Push it.
- What? Forget it.

1294
01:58:39,832 --> 01:58:41,793
It's a smear campaign,
Charlie.

1295
01:58:41,834 --> 01:58:43,795
- It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
- Oh, yeah.

1296
01:58:43,878 --> 01:58:46,923
Real selective. About as hard to get
a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.

1297
01:58:46,964 --> 01:58:50,802
Well, it's authoritive...
And overwhelmingly documented.

1298
01:58:50,843 --> 01:58:53,846
And it's bullshit. And if
I'm right, are you gonna put...

1299
01:58:53,930 --> 01:58:57,101
the Journal's reputation behind a story
that's gonna blow up in your face?

1300
01:58:57,184 --> 01:59:01,105
I'll take a look at what you got but I'm
not moving any deadlines because you say so.

1301
01:59:08,654 --> 01:59:10,614
Are you all right?

1302
01:59:12,866 --> 01:59:14,828
Yeah.

1303
01:59:24,130 --> 01:59:26,507
Officer Muravchick?

1304
01:59:26,590 --> 01:59:29,635
Thank you.

1305
01:59:29,677 --> 01:59:32,097
Officer Muravchick,
how are you?

1306
01:59:32,180 --> 01:59:34,266
- I'm Sandra Sutherland.
- How do you do?

1307
01:59:34,349 --> 01:59:36,393
Fine, thank you.
I'm doing a background check.

1308
01:59:36,476 --> 01:59:38,395
Mind if l sit down?

1309
01:59:40,605 --> 01:59:44,359
Your Honor,
could I have a word with you?

1310
01:59:44,443 --> 01:59:48,196
You presided in a dispute
over support payments.

1311
01:59:48,280 --> 01:59:51,576
Jeffrey Wigand?
Yeah, I cited him.

1312
01:59:51,659 --> 01:59:55,705
CBS is under criticism because
the CBS News program, 60 Minutes,

1313
01:59:55,788 --> 01:59:57,749
will not be presenting
an interview...

1314
01:59:57,832 --> 02:00:00,710
What the hell
are you doing?

1315
02:00:00,793 --> 02:00:02,837
What does it look like
I'm doing? I'm editing.

1316
02:00:02,879 --> 02:00:05,757
No, no, no that. I'm talking
about the Associated Press.

1317
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:10,429
They got the story that we pulled this
interview, and they talked to Mike and l.

1318
02:00:10,512 --> 02:00:12,514
Did you tell them
that we were lying?

1319
02:00:12,556 --> 02:00:14,559
No!
I should have.

1320
02:00:14,601 --> 02:00:16,811
I told them I disagreed
with you, Mike and Kluster...

1321
02:00:16,895 --> 02:00:19,731
that this segment
is as good as the original.

1322
02:00:19,773 --> 02:00:21,900
I'm not lying for you.
I'm not gonna shut up for you.

1323
02:00:21,983 --> 02:00:24,861
- Not on any of it.
- Hey, I'm not gonna fire you.

1324
02:00:24,903 --> 02:00:27,948
Okay? Take a vacation. Now!

1325
02:00:31,619 --> 02:00:35,247
Lowell? Look, I've decided
to preface Sunday's show.

1326
02:00:35,331 --> 02:00:38,125
I did three minutes on the
Ewening News. You'll want to see it.

1327
02:00:38,209 --> 02:00:41,212
- Where are you going?
- I've been banished...

1328
02:00:41,295 --> 02:00:44,549
in lieu of being fired.

1329
02:00:44,591 --> 02:00:47,594
I took off on Tisch.
I took off on Corporate.

1330
02:00:47,636 --> 02:00:50,263
They'll know they're not, uh, going
to see everything on Sunday night.

1331
02:00:51,598 --> 02:00:54,810
I don't know. How does that
get Wigand on the air?

1332
02:00:54,893 --> 02:00:57,020
Do me a favor,
will you? Spare me.

1333
02:00:57,104 --> 02:00:59,564
For God's sake, get in the
real world. What do you think?

1334
02:00:59,606 --> 02:01:03,236
I'm going to resign in protest
to force it on the air?

1335
02:01:03,277 --> 02:01:06,198
The answer's no. I don't plan
to spend the end of my days...

1336
02:01:06,281 --> 02:01:09,284
wandering in the wilderness
of National Public Radio.

1337
02:01:09,368 --> 02:01:11,286
That decision
I've already made.

1338
02:01:13,288 --> 02:01:15,707
This Sunday,
Wallace will broadcast a report...

1339
02:01:15,791 --> 02:01:20,046
on the tobacco industry, including the
tough tactics tobacco companies employ...

1340
02:01:20,130 --> 02:01:22,924
to keep a lid on information
that might be damaging.

1341
02:01:22,966 --> 02:01:25,760
Is there information
that people should have...

1342
02:01:25,844 --> 02:01:30,181
that they're not going to have because
you're not going to broadcast this interview?

1343
02:01:30,265 --> 02:01:34,310
- Yes.
- Today, CBS News president Eric Kluster...

1344
02:01:34,394 --> 02:01:37,148
defended the network's decision
not to broadcast...

1345
02:01:37,231 --> 02:01:40,192
key portions
of the controversial interview.

1346
02:01:40,276 --> 02:01:43,070
Mr. Kluster said, quote,
"The atmosphere is tougher than ever. "

1347
02:01:43,154 --> 02:01:45,614
- Where's the rest?
- Dan.

1348
02:01:45,698 --> 02:01:47,658
Where the hell's the rest?

1349
02:01:47,700 --> 02:01:50,661
- Nebraska football fans voiced their criticism...
- You cut it!

1350
02:01:50,745 --> 02:01:53,664
Coming up in
Bernard Goldberg's America.

1351
02:01:53,706 --> 02:01:56,710
- You cut the guts out of what I said!
- It was a time consideration...

1352
02:01:56,793 --> 02:01:59,630
Time? Bullshit!
You corporate lackey.

1353
02:01:59,672 --> 02:02:03,509
Who told you your incompetent little
fingers have the requisite skills to edit me?

1354
02:02:03,593 --> 02:02:06,304
I'm trying to Band-Aid a situation
here, and you're too dim...

1355
02:02:06,387 --> 02:02:08,765
Mike. Mike. Mike.

1356
02:02:08,848 --> 02:02:12,853
" Mike"? Mike!

1357
02:02:12,936 --> 02:02:14,730
Try " Mr. Wallace."

1358
02:02:14,813 --> 02:02:18,692
We work in the same corporation. Doesn't
mean we work in the same profession.

1359
02:02:18,734 --> 02:02:21,320
Now, now what are you going to do now?
You going to finesse me?

1360
02:02:21,403 --> 02:02:25,741
Lawyer me some more? I've been
in this profession 50 fucking years!

1361
02:02:25,824 --> 02:02:28,702
You and the people you work for
are destroying the most respected,

1362
02:02:28,744 --> 02:02:31,706
the highest rated, the most
profitable show on this network.

1363
02:02:47,765 --> 02:02:51,103
Here. These are
their leads, their sources.

1364
02:02:51,186 --> 02:02:54,439
- I want you to have your reporters...
- Sue in Hwang and Milo Geyelin.

1365
02:02:54,523 --> 02:02:56,691
Have them make
their own calls.

1366
02:02:56,775 --> 02:03:01,530
They'll find that these sources have a different
story than the one that's in the dossier.

1367
02:03:02,823 --> 02:03:04,741
Push the deadline,
Charlie.

1368
02:03:09,997 --> 02:03:14,335
I'll push it for a week.
I want Milo and Suein to go through it.

1369
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:30,644
What do you want
to buy him for a gift?

1370
02:03:30,727 --> 02:03:34,481
Mmm, he's into
kind of little cars that, um...

1371
02:03:34,565 --> 02:03:36,775
- That remote control thing?
- Yeah.

1372
02:03:36,859 --> 02:03:39,153
All right.
We'll go do that tomorrow.

1373
02:03:39,236 --> 02:03:43,617
The 63-36 vote was three
shy of the two-thirds needed to pass...

1374
02:03:43,659 --> 02:03:46,120
- Mom. There's Dad.
- Yes?

1375
02:03:46,162 --> 02:03:49,582
- On the TV.
- ...dating back to 1986.

1376
02:03:49,623 --> 02:03:51,792
The most recent trouble
for Wigand occurred here...

1377
02:03:51,876 --> 02:03:54,003
And in local news,
WLKO, Louisville,

1378
02:03:54,086 --> 02:03:56,672
has gained access
to a 500-page dossier...

1379
02:03:56,756 --> 02:03:59,634
on former Brown &Williamson
research head, Jeffrey Wigand,

1380
02:03:59,718 --> 02:04:03,597
detailing charges of shoplifting
and failing to pay child support.

1381
02:04:03,638 --> 02:04:05,640
Wigand is currently teaching
chemistry and Japanese...

1382
02:04:05,724 --> 02:04:07,642
at the
DuPont ManuaI High School.

1383
02:04:07,726 --> 02:04:09,644
Maria.

1384
02:04:31,292 --> 02:04:33,545
Thousands of documents
from inside the tobacco industry...

1385
02:04:33,629 --> 02:04:35,715
have surfaced
over the past year.

1386
02:04:35,757 --> 02:04:37,801
Documents that
appear to confirm...

1387
02:04:37,884 --> 02:04:39,803
what a former
U.S. Surgeon general...

1388
02:04:39,886 --> 02:04:43,765
and the current head of the Food and
Drug Administration have been saying.

1389
02:04:43,807 --> 02:04:46,434
We learned of a tobacco insider
who could tell us...

1390
02:04:46,518 --> 02:04:50,522
whether or not the tobacco industry
has been leveling with the public.

1391
02:04:50,605 --> 02:04:52,525
That insider was formerly...

1392
02:04:52,608 --> 02:04:55,528
a highly-placed executive
with a tobacco company.

1393
02:04:55,611 --> 02:04:59,448
But we cannot broadcast what critical
information about tobacco,

1394
02:04:59,490 --> 02:05:02,785
addiction and public health
he might be able to offer.

1395
02:05:02,868 --> 02:05:06,705
Why? Because he had to sign
a confidentiality agreement...

1396
02:05:06,789 --> 02:05:09,125
with the tobacco company
he worked for.

1397
02:05:09,208 --> 02:05:12,337
The management of CBS
has told us...

1398
02:05:12,420 --> 02:05:14,548
that knowing
he had that agreement...

1399
02:05:14,631 --> 02:05:17,092
if we were to broadcast
an interview with him,

1400
02:05:17,175 --> 02:05:21,096
CBS could be faced with
a multi-billion dollar lawsuit.

1401
02:05:21,179 --> 02:05:24,809
The fact is, we are not allowed
ewen to mention his name...

1402
02:05:24,892 --> 02:05:27,646
or the name of the company
he worked for.

1403
02:05:27,688 --> 02:05:32,025
And, of course, we cannot
show you his face.

1404
02:05:32,109 --> 02:05:35,195
And your confidentiality
agreement with...

1405
02:05:35,279 --> 02:05:37,823
- Is still in force?
- Yes, it is.

1406
02:05:37,906 --> 02:05:41,034
So what are they gonna do?
Sue you for making this appearance?

1407
02:05:41,118 --> 02:05:43,495
I would bet on it.

1408
02:05:43,537 --> 02:05:46,541
The former executive
has reason to bet on being sued,

1409
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:49,502
for major cigarette
manufacturers...

1410
02:06:08,606 --> 02:06:11,567
Yeah.

1411
02:06:11,650 --> 02:06:14,111
You disappeared on me.

1412
02:06:14,195 --> 02:06:17,532
- How long you staying?
- I disappeared on you?

1413
02:06:17,574 --> 02:06:20,243
All right.
What did you think?

1414
02:06:21,329 --> 02:06:23,623
I think it was
a disgrace.

1415
02:06:47,231 --> 02:06:50,943
- Still no answer.
- Get me the manager's office.

1416
02:06:52,152 --> 02:06:54,404
David. David, you've got
a call on line four.

1417
02:06:54,488 --> 02:06:57,534
I think you
better take it.

1418
02:06:57,617 --> 02:06:59,619
This is David McDougal.
How can I help you?

1419
02:06:59,702 --> 02:07:03,581
Mr. McDougal, my name is Lowell Bergman.
I'm a producer for 60 Minutes.

1420
02:07:03,623 --> 02:07:09,004
I'm concerned for a friend of mine
who's staying at your hotel right now.

1421
02:07:15,637 --> 02:07:17,764
Mr. Wigand?

1422
02:07:17,848 --> 02:07:19,766
Mr. Wigand?

1423
02:07:25,439 --> 02:07:28,608
I-l think I need to call the police.
He won't respond.

1424
02:07:28,650 --> 02:07:31,403
No, no, don't call the police. Just
tell him I'm on the phone with you.

1425
02:07:31,486 --> 02:07:33,948
My name is Lowell Bergman.
Just tell him that.

1426
02:07:33,990 --> 02:07:38,536
Mr. Wigand, Mr. Bergman
is on the telephone.

1427
02:07:38,619 --> 02:07:41,080
Did he hear you?

1428
02:07:41,164 --> 02:07:43,499
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.

1429
02:07:43,583 --> 02:07:46,169
What about now?

1430
02:07:46,252 --> 02:07:48,754
- What?
- Hello? Can you hear me now?

1431
02:08:56,495 --> 02:09:00,374
- What's happening?
- He doesn't seem to be listening.

1432
02:09:00,457 --> 02:09:04,379
All right. Now listen to me.
I want you... I want you to tell him...

1433
02:09:04,420 --> 02:09:06,881
in these words:
Get on the fucking phone.

1434
02:09:06,923 --> 02:09:09,217
I-l can't say that.

1435
02:09:09,259 --> 02:09:11,803
No, you can. Tell him
to get on the fucking phone!

1436
02:09:11,886 --> 02:09:14,973
He told me to tell you
to get on the... fucking phone!

1437
02:09:20,980 --> 02:09:23,899
You manipulated me into this.

1438
02:09:23,941 --> 02:09:26,235
- That's bullshit, Jeff.
- You greased the rails.

1439
02:09:26,277 --> 02:09:30,406
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted
to say "yes." I helped him to say "yes."

1440
02:09:30,489 --> 02:09:33,117
That's all.
You're not a robot, Jeff.

1441
02:09:33,200 --> 02:09:36,120
- All right? You got a mind of your own, don't you?
- " Up to you, Jeffrey.

1442
02:09:36,204 --> 02:09:38,415
"That's the power you have,
Jeffrey.

1443
02:09:38,457 --> 02:09:40,917
Vital inside information
the American public need to know."

1444
02:09:41,001 --> 02:09:44,464
Lowell Bergman... the hotshot who never
met a source he couldn't turn around.

1445
02:09:44,547 --> 02:09:46,757
I fought for you,
and I still fight for you!

1446
02:09:46,799 --> 02:09:49,469
You fought for me?
You manipulated me...

1447
02:09:49,552 --> 02:09:52,597
into where I am now... staring
at the Brown &Williamson building!

1448
02:09:52,680 --> 02:09:55,893
It's all dark except the tenth floor.
That's the legal department.

1449
02:09:55,976 --> 02:09:59,813
That's where they
fuck with my life.

1450
02:10:02,941 --> 02:10:04,860
Jeffrey, where you going
with this?

1451
02:10:06,487 --> 02:10:09,281
So, where you going?

1452
02:10:13,453 --> 02:10:16,289
You are... important...

1453
02:10:16,331 --> 02:10:19,250
to a lot of people,
Jeffrey.

1454
02:10:19,292 --> 02:10:21,377
You think about that.

1455
02:10:22,462 --> 02:10:24,380
You think about them.

1456
02:10:37,479 --> 02:10:39,856
I'm running out
of heroes, man.

1457
02:10:40,982 --> 02:10:43,109
Guys like you
are in short supply.

1458
02:10:49,242 --> 02:10:51,160
Yeah, guys like you too.

1459
02:10:55,957 --> 02:10:58,042
Where are you, anyway?

1460
02:10:58,126 --> 02:11:02,630
I'm on a leave of absence.
Forced vacation.

1461
02:11:04,841 --> 02:11:08,011
- You try and have a good time.
- Yeah.

1462
02:11:08,095 --> 02:11:10,389
Yeah, I will.

1463
02:11:24,487 --> 02:11:27,533
I'm Lowell Bergman. I'm from 60 Minutes.
You know, you take the 60 Minutes...

1464
02:11:27,616 --> 02:11:30,161
out of that sentence,
nobody returns your phone calls.

1465
02:11:31,454 --> 02:11:35,249
Maybe Wigand's right.
Maybe I'm hooked.

1466
02:11:36,584 --> 02:11:38,502
What am I hooked on?

1467
02:11:38,586 --> 02:11:40,839
The rush of 60 Minutes?

1468
02:11:40,922 --> 02:11:44,718
What the hell for?
"lnfotainment"!

1469
02:11:44,801 --> 02:11:47,053
It's so fucking useless,
all of it.

1470
02:11:47,137 --> 02:11:50,849
So it's a big country with a free press.
You can go and work somewhere else.

1471
02:11:50,932 --> 02:11:53,018
" Free press"?
The press is free.

1472
02:11:53,101 --> 02:11:56,771
For anyone who owns one.
Larry Tisch has a free press.

1473
02:11:56,813 --> 02:11:59,025
- Get some perspective, Lowell.
- I got perspective.

1474
02:11:59,108 --> 02:12:01,068
No, you do not.

1475
02:12:02,528 --> 02:12:05,031
From my perspective,

1476
02:12:05,114 --> 02:12:08,993
what's been going on and what
I've been doing is ridiculous.

1477
02:12:09,076 --> 02:12:11,412
- It's half-measures.
- You're not listening.

1478
02:12:17,837 --> 02:12:20,799
Really know what you're
going to do before you do it.

1479
02:13:02,467 --> 02:13:04,553
I've got Richard Scruggs on the phone.

1480
02:13:04,636 --> 02:13:07,514
Patch him through.

1481
02:13:07,597 --> 02:13:10,394
Well, Lowell, you are
not gonna believe this.

1482
02:13:10,477 --> 02:13:14,773
The governor of Mississippi
is suing his own attorney general...

1483
02:13:14,857 --> 02:13:18,443
to abandon litigation
against Big Tobacco.

1484
02:13:18,527 --> 02:13:22,406
- Oh, good.
- But now that the version without Jeff ran,

1485
02:13:22,489 --> 02:13:25,826
what's the chance of getting
his interview on the air?

1486
02:13:28,288 --> 02:13:30,373
- Hello?
- Yeah, I'm here.

1487
02:13:30,457 --> 02:13:32,834
What chance is there of getting
Jeffs interview on the air?

1488
02:13:32,876 --> 02:13:34,836
Less than great.

1489
02:13:39,507 --> 02:13:41,801
I'd be lying to you
if l did not tell you...

1490
02:13:41,885 --> 02:13:45,264
how important it was
in the court of public opinion.

1491
02:13:45,347 --> 02:13:48,017
I'd be lying to you
if l didn't tell you...

1492
02:13:48,100 --> 02:13:51,854
I'm about out of moves,
Dick.

1493
02:13:54,106 --> 02:13:56,066
All right.
See ya.

1494
02:14:18,216 --> 02:14:20,844
Hi.

1495
02:14:22,596 --> 02:14:26,934
So, what are you folks
doing... here in Lincoln?

1496
02:14:28,018 --> 02:14:32,022
- Geology survey.
- Geology?

1497
02:14:32,105 --> 02:14:35,108
Yeah?
Really?

1498
02:14:35,192 --> 02:14:37,110
How about you?

1499
02:14:38,530 --> 02:14:41,074
I work for CBS News.

1500
02:14:41,157 --> 02:14:43,660
Oh, yeah?

1501
02:15:10,981 --> 02:15:13,567
Just ran into
two of your geologists.

1502
02:15:13,650 --> 02:15:16,154
Geologists whose hands
aren't all chewed up.

1503
02:15:16,237 --> 02:15:20,283
Lowell, do not...
Screw this up.

1504
02:15:20,366 --> 02:15:22,743
We are a week away
from an arrest.

1505
02:15:22,827 --> 02:15:27,165
- So I'll hold it. And? - We'll
give you a heads-up before we launch.

1506
02:15:27,206 --> 02:15:29,709
- How long?
- Three hours.

1507
02:15:29,792 --> 02:15:31,712
You got a deal.

1508
02:15:47,020 --> 02:15:50,691
...like the testimony before Congress
of Dr. Wigand's former boss,

1509
02:15:50,774 --> 02:15:54,528
Brown &Williamson's chief
executive officer, Thomas Sandefur.

1510
02:15:54,612 --> 02:15:56,864
I believe that nicotine
is not addictive.

1511
02:15:56,906 --> 02:15:59,408
I believe Mr. Sandefur
perjured himself...

1512
02:15:59,492 --> 02:16:03,204
- because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
- All of us did.

1513
02:16:03,245 --> 02:16:05,456
There was this
whole line of people,

1514
02:16:05,539 --> 02:16:08,043
whole line of C.E.O.'s
up there all swearing.

1515
02:16:08,126 --> 02:16:11,213
Part of the reason I'm here
is that I felt...

1516
02:16:11,296 --> 02:16:13,507
that their representation...

1517
02:16:42,956 --> 02:16:44,874
...can be more rapidly absorbed
in the lung...

1518
02:16:44,958 --> 02:16:47,085
and therefore affect the brain
and central nervous system.

1519
02:17:11,777 --> 02:17:13,696
- Hello?
- Jim, it's Lowell.

1520
02:17:13,779 --> 02:17:17,491
- Hey, where are you?
- Remember that night at P.J.'s?

1521
02:17:17,575 --> 02:17:21,079
You asked me if we were sitting on something
explosive. Well, we're not sitting on it.

1522
02:17:21,163 --> 02:17:24,875
CBS Corporate leaned on CBS News,
which yanked an interview we did...

1523
02:17:24,958 --> 02:17:28,921
with a top-ranking tobacco scientist,
corporate officer.

1524
02:17:29,005 --> 02:17:31,048
They're trying to
close down the story.

1525
02:17:31,132 --> 02:17:34,385
You mean, 60 Minutes
is letting CBS Corporate...

1526
02:17:34,468 --> 02:17:36,805
decide what is
or is not news?

1527
02:17:36,889 --> 02:17:39,516
What's Wallace think
about this? Or Hewitt, or...

1528
02:17:39,600 --> 02:17:41,727
How prominent?
What kind of placement?

1529
02:17:41,810 --> 02:17:45,272
Oh, come on, Lowell. This is
The New York Times. I don't know.

1530
02:17:45,314 --> 02:17:49,526
Well, until you do, all I can
tell you is what you already know.

1531
02:17:49,610 --> 02:17:51,612
They will not
air an interview.

1532
02:17:51,695 --> 02:17:54,073
Call me back in ten.

1533
02:18:01,873 --> 02:18:04,167
- Hello?
- Debbie, it's me.

1534
02:18:04,250 --> 02:18:06,669
Hi.
What time is it?

1535
02:18:06,753 --> 02:18:10,798
- Oh, it's late.
- That I know. When are you coming back?

1536
02:18:10,882 --> 02:18:13,636
I can't get out of here till
mid-morning. I'll be in tomorrow night.

1537
02:18:13,719 --> 02:18:17,348
Listen, could you call a number
for me? It's in Mississippi.

1538
02:18:17,431 --> 02:18:19,350
Okay.
Hold on a second.

1539
02:18:21,812 --> 02:18:23,772
What is it?

1540
02:18:29,612 --> 02:18:31,531
- Hello?
- It's Lowell.

1541
02:18:31,614 --> 02:18:35,618
All right, Lowell. Page one.
Editorial's interested. Let's talk.

1542
02:18:35,701 --> 02:18:40,081
Here's how it works. You ask me
questions. I tell you if you're wrong.

1543
02:18:40,164 --> 02:18:44,418
- Lowell, you sure you want to do this?
- Why?

1544
02:18:44,502 --> 02:18:48,048
Hey, it doesn't work,
you've burned your bridges, man.

1545
02:18:48,131 --> 02:18:50,300
You ready?

1546
02:18:50,384 --> 02:18:52,928
Okay.
About this whistle-blower,

1547
02:18:53,011 --> 02:18:55,722
did Mike and Don go along
with the corporate decision?

1548
02:18:57,891 --> 02:19:02,688
- Lowell?
- Did I tell you you were wrong?

1549
02:19:02,729 --> 02:19:06,693
No. Um, I'm assuming
the cave-in begins...

1550
02:19:06,776 --> 02:19:09,195
with the threat of litigation
from Big Tobacco.

1551
02:19:09,237 --> 02:19:11,740
Are we talking, uh...

1552
02:19:11,824 --> 02:19:14,702
Are we talking
Brown &Williamson here?

1553
02:19:47,528 --> 02:19:49,572
Did I get you up?

1554
02:19:49,655 --> 02:19:53,701
No, I usually sit around my hotel room
dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning,

1555
02:19:53,784 --> 02:19:55,703
sleepy look on my face.

1556
02:19:57,747 --> 02:19:59,750
How many shows have
we done? Huh?

1557
02:19:59,791 --> 02:20:01,919
- Come on. How many?
- Oh, lots.

1558
02:20:01,960 --> 02:20:03,922
That's right.

1559
02:20:05,840 --> 02:20:08,343
But in all that time,
Mike,

1560
02:20:08,426 --> 02:20:11,221
did you ever get off a plane,
walk into a room...

1561
02:20:11,304 --> 02:20:16,477
and find that a source
for a story changed his mind?

1562
02:20:16,560 --> 02:20:18,854
Lost his heart?
Walked out on us?

1563
02:20:18,938 --> 02:20:21,607
Not one fucking time.
You wanna know why?

1564
02:20:21,690 --> 02:20:24,235
I see a rhetorical question
on the horizon.

1565
02:20:24,318 --> 02:20:26,237
I'm gonna tell you why.

1566
02:20:26,320 --> 02:20:29,740
Because when I tell someone
I'm gonna do something, I deliver.

1567
02:20:29,824 --> 02:20:33,954
Oh, how fortunate I am to have
Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage...

1568
02:20:34,037 --> 02:20:36,790
- to point me down the shining path, to show me the way.
- Oh, please, Mike.

1569
02:20:36,832 --> 02:20:39,125
- Give me a break.
- You give me a break.

1570
02:20:39,167 --> 02:20:42,295
I never left a source
hung out to dry ewer.

1571
02:20:42,379 --> 02:20:45,298
Abandoned.
Not till right fucking now.

1572
02:20:45,340 --> 02:20:49,094
When I came on this job,
I came with my word intact.

1573
02:20:49,177 --> 02:20:53,099
I'm gonna leave with my word intact.
Fuck the rules of the game!

1574
02:20:53,182 --> 02:20:55,143
Hell, you're supposed
to know me, Mike.

1575
02:20:55,185 --> 02:20:57,312
What the hell
did you expect?

1576
02:20:57,354 --> 02:21:00,023
You expect me to lie down?

1577
02:21:00,107 --> 02:21:03,110
Back off?
Or get over it?

1578
02:21:03,193 --> 02:21:07,364
In the real world, when you get to where
I am, there are other considerations.

1579
02:21:07,447 --> 02:21:10,660
Like what?
Corporate responsibility?

1580
02:21:10,702 --> 02:21:12,954
- What, are we talking celebrity here?
- I'm not...

1581
02:21:13,037 --> 02:21:16,958
I'm not talking about
celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm...

1582
02:21:17,041 --> 02:21:19,002
I'm...
I'm talking about...

1583
02:21:19,043 --> 02:21:23,173
when you're nearer the end
of your life than the beginning.

1584
02:21:23,256 --> 02:21:27,010
And what do you think
you think about then? The future?

1585
02:21:27,052 --> 02:21:29,722
"ln the future, I'm gonna
do this, become that"?

1586
02:21:29,805 --> 02:21:32,016
What future? No.

1587
02:21:32,057 --> 02:21:34,977
What you think is...

1588
02:21:35,060 --> 02:21:37,563
" How will I be regarded
in the end...

1589
02:21:37,646 --> 02:21:41,233
after I'm gone?"

1590
02:21:41,317 --> 02:21:45,280
Oh, along the way, I suppose
I made some minor impact.

1591
02:21:45,363 --> 02:21:49,410
I did lrangate,
the Ayatollah, Malcolm X,

1592
02:21:49,494 --> 02:21:52,246
Martin Luther King,
Saddam, Sadat, etc, etc.

1593
02:21:52,330 --> 02:21:57,043
I showed them thieves in suits.
I spent a lifetime building...

1594
02:21:57,084 --> 02:21:59,045
all that.

1595
02:22:00,630 --> 02:22:05,969
But history only remembers most
what you did last.

1596
02:22:06,053 --> 02:22:09,181
And should that be
fronting a segment...

1597
02:22:09,264 --> 02:22:13,018
that allowed a tobacco giant
to crash this network...

1598
02:22:19,233 --> 02:22:21,736
Does it give someone...

1599
02:22:21,819 --> 02:22:27,116
at my time of life pause?

1600
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:29,118
Yeah.

1601
02:22:36,084 --> 02:22:38,003
Mike,

1602
02:22:39,798 --> 02:22:41,716
in my...

1603
02:22:43,844 --> 02:22:47,013
You and I
have been doing this...

1604
02:22:47,097 --> 02:22:50,934
together for 1 4 years.

1605
02:22:52,561 --> 02:22:55,522
This is today's
New York Times.

1606
02:22:55,605 --> 02:22:57,775
In it is the whole
sordid story...

1607
02:22:57,859 --> 02:23:01,445
of what went on
inside our shop.

1608
02:23:01,487 --> 02:23:06,033
And in the editorial,
it accuses us...

1609
02:23:06,117 --> 02:23:09,078
of betraying the legacy
of Edward R. Murrow.

1610
02:23:34,273 --> 02:23:37,067
They conclude most of it
seems pretty unsubstantiated.

1611
02:23:46,202 --> 02:23:48,120
You're full of shit,
John.

1612
02:23:58,798 --> 02:24:00,759
Yeah.

1613
02:24:00,800 --> 02:24:03,512
Front page. There's a picture of Wigand.

1614
02:24:03,595 --> 02:24:05,514
Article's entitled,
"Getting Personal. "

1615
02:24:05,597 --> 02:24:07,600
Byline to Sue in Hwang
and Milo Geyelin.

1616
02:24:07,642 --> 02:24:10,102
Wait. Hold on
a second, Lowell.

1617
02:24:10,144 --> 02:24:12,021
Yeah.

1618
02:24:16,526 --> 02:24:19,153
Yeah, I'll see
if l can find him.

1619
02:24:19,237 --> 02:24:22,366
Yeah, hold on.
Don's looking for you.

1620
02:24:22,449 --> 02:24:25,828
- Good.
- The subheading is " Brown &Williamson...

1621
02:24:25,912 --> 02:24:29,123
has a 500-page dossier
attacking chief critic."

1622
02:24:29,165 --> 02:24:31,584
It quotes Richard Scruggs
calling it the worst kind...

1623
02:24:31,668 --> 02:24:34,963
of an organized smear campaign
against a whistle-blower.

1624
02:24:35,004 --> 02:24:38,508
"A close look at the file and
independent research by this newspaper...

1625
02:24:38,591 --> 02:24:41,886
"into its key claim indicates
that many of the serious allegations...

1626
02:24:41,970 --> 02:24:47,268
against Mr. Wigand are backed by
scant or contradictory evidence."

1627
02:25:06,705 --> 02:25:09,374
This news division has been wilified...

1628
02:25:09,457 --> 02:25:12,294
in The New York Times,
in print, on television...

1629
02:25:12,377 --> 02:25:14,297
for caving
to corporate interests!

1630
02:25:14,380 --> 02:25:18,343
The New York Times ran a blow-by-blow of
what we talked about behind closed doors.

1631
02:25:18,385 --> 02:25:21,138
- You fucked us!
- No! You fucked you!

1632
02:25:21,221 --> 02:25:23,182
Don't invert stuff.

1633
02:25:23,265 --> 02:25:26,101
Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand.
You bought it.

1634
02:25:26,185 --> 02:25:29,104
The WalI Street Journal...
Here... not exactly...

1635
02:25:29,188 --> 02:25:31,857
a bastion of
anti-capitalist sentiment,

1636
02:25:31,940 --> 02:25:34,526
refutes Big Tobacco's
smear campaign...

1637
02:25:34,568 --> 02:25:38,031
as the lowest form
of character assassination.

1638
02:25:38,072 --> 02:25:40,074
And now, even now,
when every word...

1639
02:25:40,116 --> 02:25:43,119
of what Wigand has said
on our show is printed,

1640
02:25:43,203 --> 02:25:46,831
the entire deposition
of his testimony in a court of law...

1641
02:25:46,915 --> 02:25:49,042
in the state of Mississippi,
the cat...

1642
02:25:49,125 --> 02:25:51,836
totally out of the bag,

1643
02:25:51,920 --> 02:25:53,964
you're still
standing here debating.

1644
02:25:54,048 --> 02:25:58,385
Don, what the hell else
do you need?

1645
02:25:58,427 --> 02:26:00,846
Mike, you tell him.

1646
02:26:00,930 --> 02:26:02,890
You fucked up, Don.

1647
02:26:10,190 --> 02:26:13,236
It's old news. Stick with me,
like always. We'll be okay.

1648
02:26:13,277 --> 02:26:16,405
These things have
a half-life of 1 5 minutes.

1649
02:26:16,447 --> 02:26:20,451
No, that's fame.
Fame has a 1 5-minute half-life.

1650
02:26:20,535 --> 02:26:22,495
Infamy lasts
a little longer.

1651
02:26:22,578 --> 02:26:27,750
We caved. It's foolish.
It's simply dead wrong.

1652
02:26:27,833 --> 02:26:31,755
Now this is what we're going to do.
We're going over to Black Rock...

1653
02:26:35,467 --> 02:26:39,930
Okay? So let's get back to work.
Now what we saw there...

1654
02:26:39,972 --> 02:26:42,599
was two potassium chlorate...

1655
02:26:42,683 --> 02:26:47,856
would yield two potassium
chloride, also a solid...

1656
02:26:57,908 --> 02:27:02,204
They cancelled the 6:00.
I don't know why. I...

1657
02:27:02,288 --> 02:27:06,042
I'm on the 8:1 0.
I should be home... 9:30.

1658
02:27:06,126 --> 02:27:08,587
I'll see you then.
I love you. Bye.

1659
02:27:22,852 --> 02:27:24,812
- Oh. Thanks, Dad.
- Thanks.

1660
02:27:37,450 --> 02:27:39,410
CBS management wouldn't
let us broadcast...

1661
02:27:39,493 --> 02:27:42,998
our original story and our
interview with Jeffrey Wigand...

1662
02:27:43,040 --> 02:27:45,459
because they were worried
about the possibility...

1663
02:27:45,542 --> 02:27:48,421
of a multi-billion dollar
lawsuit against us...

1664
02:27:48,504 --> 02:27:50,798
for tortious interference.

1665
02:27:50,882 --> 02:27:53,051
But now things have changed.

1666
02:27:53,134 --> 02:27:55,929
What Dr. Wigand told us
was that his former...

1667
02:28:25,126 --> 02:28:28,088
This industry,
in my opinion, is an industry...

1668
02:28:28,129 --> 02:28:32,092
that has perpetrated the biggest fraud
on the American public in history.

1669
02:28:32,175 --> 02:28:34,303
They've killed millions
and millions of...

1670
02:28:57,453 --> 02:29:00,665
You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?

1671
02:29:00,748 --> 02:29:05,086
Yeah, there are times
I wish I hadn't done it.

1672
02:29:05,128 --> 02:29:10,301
There are times I feel com...
Compelled to do it.

1673
02:29:10,384 --> 02:29:12,303
If you ask me...

1674
02:29:12,386 --> 02:29:15,389
would I do it again,
do I think it's worth it?

1675
02:29:18,309 --> 02:29:20,269
Yeah, I think it's worth it.

1676
02:29:25,816 --> 02:29:29,613
I promised you a three-hour
heads up. Here it is.

1677
02:29:29,654 --> 02:29:33,117
Have a camera crew standing by
in Helena, Montana on Tuesday,

1678
02:29:33,159 --> 02:29:35,119
and I'll give you
a three-hour head start.

1679
02:29:35,161 --> 02:29:38,539
All right? By the way, that was
a hell of a good show tonight.

1680
02:29:38,623 --> 02:29:40,625
- Thank you, Bill.
- Yeah.

1681
02:30:00,020 --> 02:30:03,274
You won.

1682
02:30:03,358 --> 02:30:05,276
Yeah.

1683
02:30:08,613 --> 02:30:10,532
What did I win?

1684
02:30:14,285 --> 02:30:18,581
Reporting from CBS News world head
quarters in New York, good afternoon.

1685
02:30:18,665 --> 02:30:21,293
There has been a major breakin
the case of the so-called Unabomber.

1686
02:30:21,377 --> 02:30:23,296
CBS News has learned
that are mote homesite...

1687
02:30:23,380 --> 02:30:25,507
outside of Lincoln, Montana...

1688
02:30:25,590 --> 02:30:29,010
has been under F.B.I.
Surveillance for several weeks.

1689
02:30:30,554 --> 02:30:32,514
Great, Lowell.

1690
02:30:41,566 --> 02:30:43,985
Thanks for this.

1691
02:30:44,068 --> 02:30:48,614
You know, we beat everybody.
ABC, NBC, CNN.

1692
02:30:51,742 --> 02:30:53,703
Mike.

1693
02:31:01,253 --> 02:31:03,630
That Canada story...

1694
02:31:03,714 --> 02:31:05,632
still interest you?

1695
02:31:05,716 --> 02:31:09,678
Everything interests me.

1696
02:31:09,761 --> 02:31:11,680
Uh, I quit, Mike.

1697
02:31:14,100 --> 02:31:16,020
Bullshit.

1698
02:31:17,521 --> 02:31:20,232
Come on.

1699
02:31:20,274 --> 02:31:22,776
It all worked out.

1700
02:31:22,818 --> 02:31:25,738
You came out okay
in the end.

1701
02:31:25,779 --> 02:31:27,781
I did?

1702
02:31:27,823 --> 02:31:31,076
What do I tell a source
on the next tough story?

1703
02:31:31,160 --> 02:31:34,122
" Hang in with us.
You'll be fine. Maybe."

1704
02:31:34,164 --> 02:31:36,958
No.

1705
02:31:37,042 --> 02:31:40,045
What got broken here...

1706
02:31:40,128 --> 02:31:42,631
doesn't go
back together again.
