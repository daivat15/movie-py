1
00:05:15,597 --> 00:05:17,497
Look out the window.

2
00:05:21,437 --> 00:05:24,429
And doesn't this remind you
of when you were in the boat?

3
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:28,509
And then later that night,

4
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,637
you were lying, looking
up at the ceiling,

5
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:35,717
and the water
in your head...

6
00:05:35,818 --> 00:05:38,616
was not dissimilar
from the landscape,

7
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,315
and you think to yourself,
"Why is it that the landscape...

8
00:05:42,424 --> 00:05:44,517
is moving,

9
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:48,529
but... the boat
is still?"

10
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:54,637
And also-- Where is it
that you're from?

11
00:05:56,072 --> 00:05:59,439
- Cleveland.
- Cleveland.

12
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:05,871
- Lake Erie.
- Erie.

13
00:06:05,982 --> 00:06:09,850
Do you have any parents
back in, uh, Erie?

14
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:13,785
They passed on recently.

15
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,794
And, uh,

16
00:06:20,897 --> 00:06:23,366
do you have a wife...

17
00:06:25,336 --> 00:06:27,236
in Erie?

18
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:30,068
No.

19
00:06:30,174 --> 00:06:33,575
- A fiancee?
- Well, I--

20
00:06:33,677 --> 00:06:35,907
I had one of those,
but, um,

21
00:06:38,082 --> 00:06:40,016
she changed her mind.

22
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:46,211
- She found herself somebody else.
- No.

23
00:06:48,092 --> 00:06:49,992
Yes, she did.

24
00:06:52,796 --> 00:06:56,756
Well, that doesn't explain...

25
00:06:56,868 --> 00:06:59,496
why you've come
all the way out here,

26
00:06:59,604 --> 00:07:01,595
all the way out here to hell.

27
00:07:04,242 --> 00:07:06,210
l, uh,

28
00:07:06,311 --> 00:07:10,771
have a job
out in the town of Machine.

29
00:07:10,882 --> 00:07:13,544
Machine? That's
the end of the line.

30
00:07:13,652 --> 00:07:16,553
- Is it?
- Yes.

31
00:07:19,157 --> 00:07:21,421
Well, I...

32
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:24,427
received a letter...

33
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:28,860
from the people at Dickinson's
Metal Works...

34
00:07:28,968 --> 00:07:30,868
Oh.

35
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,131
assuring me
of a job there.

36
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:35,332
Is that so?

37
00:07:35,441 --> 00:07:38,239
- Yes. I'm an accountant.

38
00:07:38,344 --> 00:07:43,475
I wouldn't know,
because, uh, I don't read,

39
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:48,077
but, uh, I'll tell you
one thing for sure:

40
00:07:48,187 --> 00:07:51,623
I wouldn't trust no words
written down on no piece of paper,

41
00:07:51,724 --> 00:07:56,627
especially from no "Dickinson"
out in the town of Machine.

42
00:07:56,729 --> 00:07:59,926
- You're just as likely
to find your own grave.

43
00:08:02,369 --> 00:08:05,497
Look. They're
shooting buffalo.

44
00:08:11,011 --> 00:08:12,979
Government says...

45
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,846
killed a million of 'em
last year alone.

46
00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:58,372
Pardon me, sir. Could you please
direct me towards the office?

47
00:13:03,212 --> 00:13:05,112
Thank you.

48
00:13:32,108 --> 00:13:34,702
Excuse me.

49
00:13:34,811 --> 00:13:37,302
Excuse me.
How do you do, sir?

50
00:13:37,414 --> 00:13:39,848
I'm Bill Blake,
your new accountant from Cleveland.

51
00:13:41,217 --> 00:13:43,412
What the heck
are you doin' here?

52
00:13:45,288 --> 00:13:49,384
Well, uh, I have here
this letter...

53
00:13:49,492 --> 00:13:51,585
which confirms
my position here.

54
00:13:55,265 --> 00:13:58,792
Well, this letter
is postmarked two months ago.

55
00:13:58,902 --> 00:14:01,029
Makes you about
a month late.

56
00:14:01,137 --> 00:14:04,699
This here is Mr. Olafsen.
He's our new accountant.

57
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:14,507
I'm sorry. I think
there's been some mistake.

58
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:17,678
- Look, Mr. Black,
- Blake.

59
00:14:17,788 --> 00:14:22,748
I'm a very busy man, and Mr. Dickinson
does not pay me for idle conversation.

60
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,763
Well, I'm sure he doesn't, but
this letter confirms my position here.

61
00:14:27,865 --> 00:14:31,801
Now, I've spent everything I had
left after my parent's funeral just to get here.

62
00:14:31,902 --> 00:14:35,930
Listen, Mr. Black,
I've got a lot of work to do here,

63
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,067
and this ain't
my business.

64
00:14:39,177 --> 00:14:41,805
I'd like to speak
to Mr. Dickinson.

65
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,625
No, l-I don't think
you want to do that.

66
00:14:54,726 --> 00:14:57,388
I insist on speaking
to Mr. Dickinson, sir.

67
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,657
You insist?

68
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:02,700
- I insist.
- You insist?

69
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,403
Yes, I do.

70
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:13,111
Well, go on then, lad.
There's the door.

71
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,783
All right then.

72
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,785
Go on then!

73
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,721
Well, I will.

74
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,299
Hello?

75
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,342
Mr. Dickinson?

76
00:16:13,675 --> 00:16:15,575
Who the hell are you?

77
00:16:15,677 --> 00:16:20,011
And where did you get
that goddamn clown suit? Cleveland?

78
00:16:20,115 --> 00:16:23,278
Well, actually, yes, sir.

79
00:16:23,384 --> 00:16:25,818
I did, uh, get it
in Cleveland.

80
00:16:27,188 --> 00:16:29,656
What the hell are you
doin' in my office?

81
00:16:29,757 --> 00:16:32,487
Well, l-l-I came
to talk about my job.

82
00:16:32,594 --> 00:16:37,224
The only job you're gonna get in here
is pushin' up daisies from a pine box.

83
00:16:37,332 --> 00:16:39,391
Now get out.

84
00:16:42,504 --> 00:16:44,404
Thank you
very much, sir.

85
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,490
Back to work,
Mr. Olafsen.

86
00:18:01,152 --> 00:18:03,052
Excuse me.

87
00:18:51,303 --> 00:18:53,203
Excuse me.

88
00:18:53,305 --> 00:18:55,205
Sorry.

89
00:18:56,908 --> 00:18:58,809
Pardon me, sir.

90
00:19:01,748 --> 00:19:03,648
Could I get
a bottle, please?

91
00:20:13,822 --> 00:20:16,222
We liked you better
when you was a whore.

92
00:20:19,494 --> 00:20:21,758
Jackass.

93
00:20:24,132 --> 00:20:26,259
Shit!

94
00:20:35,643 --> 00:20:38,169
Why don't you just
paint my portrait?

95
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,088
I'm sorry.

96
00:20:46,188 --> 00:20:49,180
- Let me help here. One.
- This one's no good. No, it's ruined.

97
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,259
- Two.
- It's no good.

98
00:20:55,097 --> 00:20:57,565
- Oh, here. Oh!

99
00:20:59,034 --> 00:21:00,934
Watch yourself.

100
00:21:01,036 --> 00:21:03,561
- You okay? You all right?
- Yeah.

101
00:21:03,672 --> 00:21:06,072
Here. Have a drink.
Would you like a drink?

102
00:21:07,343 --> 00:21:09,243
Thanks.

103
00:21:20,991 --> 00:21:22,891
I'm sorry.

104
00:21:24,694 --> 00:21:27,595
Would you mind walking me
away from here?

105
00:21:30,066 --> 00:21:32,261
- S-Sure. Sure.
- Yeah?

106
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,870
I'll just get
my suitcase.

107
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:45,981
- It's that way.
- All right.

108
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:51,955
- Oh, shit.

109
00:21:52,056 --> 00:21:56,425
I have a sneaking suspicion that that
large man back there was inebriated.

110
00:21:56,527 --> 00:22:00,520
- I was gonna say something, but I
don't wanna cause any trouble. - No, I think it's best.

111
00:22:08,005 --> 00:22:09,905
That's my room.

112
00:22:12,977 --> 00:22:16,914
Wasn't... expecting
any visitor.

113
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:35,929
- Like it?
- Yes, it's beautiful.

114
00:22:37,135 --> 00:22:39,399
These flowers. Gosh.

115
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,340
They really
are something.

116
00:22:44,543 --> 00:22:46,875
Yeah. Thank you.

117
00:22:46,979 --> 00:22:48,880
You're welcome.

118
00:22:52,952 --> 00:22:56,410
I made them
from paper.

119
00:23:04,697 --> 00:23:06,597
If I ever get the money,

120
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:09,327
I'd like to make them
out of cloth.

121
00:23:10,737 --> 00:23:13,103
Silk.

122
00:23:13,206 --> 00:23:15,674
And I'd put
a drop of perfume--

123
00:23:18,845 --> 00:23:21,178
French perfume--

124
00:23:21,282 --> 00:23:23,944
in each one.

125
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:33,660
What does it
smell like?

126
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:38,455
- Paper.
- Well, it is paper.

127
00:23:51,045 --> 00:23:55,278
Hey, Bill.
You got any tobacco anywhere?

128
00:23:55,383 --> 00:23:58,045
- No, I don't smoke.
- Damn.

129
00:24:00,555 --> 00:24:02,455
Ow!

130
00:24:05,427 --> 00:24:07,327
Oh, watch it.
It's loaded.

131
00:24:10,265 --> 00:24:12,256
Why do you
have this?

132
00:24:13,401 --> 00:24:15,392
'Cause this is America.

133
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,983
Charlie.

134
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,296
You know, Thel,

135
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:46,100
I never wanted
to go away.

136
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:50,262
I know we said
it was, uh,

137
00:24:50,373 --> 00:24:52,398
it was all over
and everything, but...

138
00:24:56,946 --> 00:24:59,244
you were always
in my heart, Thel.

139
00:25:01,118 --> 00:25:03,018
Always.

140
00:25:05,155 --> 00:25:07,350
I, uh--

141
00:25:07,457 --> 00:25:09,482
I brought you, uh--

142
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:13,723
Well, it's a present.

143
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,631
A present?

144
00:25:22,739 --> 00:25:24,639
Well, l, uh--

145
00:25:26,543 --> 00:25:28,443
I'm-- I'm goin'.

146
00:25:30,047 --> 00:25:32,311
And, uh,

147
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:36,877
I'm-- I'm sorry, Thel,

148
00:25:38,456 --> 00:25:40,390
for, uh,

149
00:25:41,893 --> 00:25:43,793
for intrudin'.

150
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,890
Well, I never really
loved you anyway.

151
00:25:54,439 --> 00:25:56,339
No, Charlie.

152
00:25:58,376 --> 00:26:00,867
- I never stopped lovingly, Thel.
- Don't!

153
00:26:40,587 --> 00:26:42,487
Thel.

154
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:26,255
Here's white man's metal
next to your heart.

155
00:28:26,362 --> 00:28:29,456
I tried to cut it out,
but it's too deep inside.

156
00:28:32,902 --> 00:28:34,961
A knife would cut
your heart instead...

157
00:28:35,071 --> 00:28:37,335
and release the spirit
from within.

158
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:41,673
Stupid fucking white man.

159
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,795
Do you have any tobacco?

160
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,425
I don't smoke.

161
00:29:39,537 --> 00:29:42,802
Hey, Wilson,
got any extra tobacco?

162
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:47,173
Well, of course you wouldn't have
any extra tobacco. How 'bout you?

163
00:29:50,181 --> 00:29:52,979
Shit. You ain't even
old enough to smoke.

164
00:30:16,442 --> 00:30:18,603
Mr.John Dickinson.

165
00:30:27,886 --> 00:30:31,288
Last night,
my youngest son, Charlie--

166
00:30:31,391 --> 00:30:33,325
God bless his soul--

167
00:30:33,426 --> 00:30:38,056
was gunned down in cold blood
right here in our own hotel.

168
00:30:38,164 --> 00:30:43,534
The gutless murderer,
one Mr. Bill Blake, also shot to death Miss Thel Russel,

169
00:30:43,636 --> 00:30:46,605
the fiance
of my beloved son.

170
00:30:46,706 --> 00:30:51,643
Not only that, but he stole
a very spirited and valuable horse,

171
00:30:51,745 --> 00:30:57,081
a beautiful young pinto that belonged
to my personal family stable.

172
00:30:57,183 --> 00:31:01,985
Hell, only, a pinto ain't
rightly a horse to fret much about, if the truth be told.

173
00:31:02,089 --> 00:31:04,387
Shut up!

174
00:31:16,337 --> 00:31:20,398
You three are supposed to be
the finest killers of men and Indians...

175
00:31:20,508 --> 00:31:23,102
in this here
half of the world.

176
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:27,840
Cole Wilson,
your reputation is already a legend.

177
00:31:27,948 --> 00:31:30,678
You I know I can trust.

178
00:31:30,785 --> 00:31:34,688
Conway Twill,you're
a real good killer,

179
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:38,783
but be sure you keep
that goddamn trap shut.

180
00:31:38,894 --> 00:31:41,124
And Johnny
"The Kid"Pickett.

181
00:31:41,229 --> 00:31:44,130
I heard tell
you killed 14 men.

182
00:31:44,232 --> 00:31:46,325
I doubt you've seen
that many years,

183
00:31:46,435 --> 00:31:50,428
and I ain't even gonna tell you
what I really think of you.

184
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:53,838
- I always work alone.
- Uh, excuse me there, Mr. Dickinson,

185
00:31:53,942 --> 00:31:58,140
but, uh, rightly l, I never
have worked with anyone else either.

186
00:31:58,246 --> 00:32:01,340
- I never have.
- Uh, yeah, m-me neither.

187
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,611
Shut up!

188
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:07,817
My boy Charlie is dead!

189
00:32:09,926 --> 00:32:14,260
Oh, I ain't askin' this time.
I'm tellin',

190
00:32:14,363 --> 00:32:19,699
and if somebody don't
like it, I'm prepared to do a little killin' of my own.

191
00:32:19,802 --> 00:32:23,738
Now, that bastard
couldn't have got too far yet.

192
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,673
Well, why don't we just
say there, Mr. Dickinson, sir,

193
00:32:26,776 --> 00:32:29,574
I think we oughta start
uh, fresh in the mornin'.

194
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,113
I mean, it's
well after noon now,

195
00:32:32,215 --> 00:32:35,082
and time we get finished,
all packed up and--

196
00:32:43,627 --> 00:32:47,063
I want him brought here to me--
alive or dead don't matter,

197
00:32:47,164 --> 00:32:50,156
though I reckon dead
would be easier.

198
00:32:50,267 --> 00:32:53,202
I'm a-hiring boys
on an exclusive basis,

199
00:32:53,303 --> 00:32:57,603
and I'm willing pay more money
than you've ever seen before.

200
00:32:59,743 --> 00:33:01,643
Boys,

201
00:33:05,549 --> 00:33:08,450
the hunt is on.

202
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,379
Stupid fucking
white man.

203
00:34:23,096 --> 00:34:25,291
I want this out
over the wires.

204
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:29,232
Post a $500 reward
from here to hell and back.

205
00:34:29,336 --> 00:34:34,899
Notify every marshal, deputy
and possum-skinnin' lowlife in the goddamn territory.

206
00:34:35,008 --> 00:34:38,034
Bring everybody in.
I want that bastard's head.

207
00:34:38,144 --> 00:34:42,513
And make sure you include
a full description of my pinto. I want that horse back.

208
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:46,951
Goddamn pinto is a stupid damn animal.

209
00:34:47,053 --> 00:34:49,453
Stupid as the day
is long.

210
00:34:51,993 --> 00:34:55,224
Got his heart so set on one.
Buy yourself a sorrel horse...

211
00:34:55,329 --> 00:34:58,093
and paint some white spots on him
as far as I'm concerned.

212
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:00,099
Jesus Christ.

213
00:35:00,201 --> 00:35:04,001
Course, ya can't put much stock
in a man who spends the most part of a conversation...

214
00:35:04,105 --> 00:35:06,005
talkin' to a bear.

215
00:35:07,642 --> 00:35:09,542
Talkin'
to a goddamn bear.

216
00:35:32,401 --> 00:35:35,029
The round stones
beneath the earth...

217
00:35:35,137 --> 00:35:37,037
have spoken
through the fire.

218
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,910
What?

219
00:35:44,012 --> 00:35:48,506
Things which are alike,
in nature, grow to look alike,

220
00:35:50,285 --> 00:35:54,187
and the speaking stones have lain
a long time lookin' at the sun.

221
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,366
The speaking stones?

222
00:36:04,467 --> 00:36:06,560
Some believe
they descend with the lightning,

223
00:36:06,669 --> 00:36:11,766
but I believe they are on the ground
and are projected downward by the bolt.

224
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:18,579
Did you kill the white man
who killed you?

225
00:36:25,488 --> 00:36:27,388
I'm not dead.

226
00:36:31,528 --> 00:36:34,497
What name were you given
at birth, stupid white man?

227
00:36:40,003 --> 00:36:42,437
Blake.

228
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:45,269
William Blake.

229
00:36:45,376 --> 00:36:48,504
Is this a lie?
Or a white man's trick?

230
00:36:48,612 --> 00:36:51,911
- No, I'm William Blake.

231
00:36:54,585 --> 00:36:56,849
Then you are a dead man.

232
00:36:58,589 --> 00:37:00,489
I'm sorry. I d--
I don't understand.

233
00:37:02,526 --> 00:37:04,859
Is your name really
William Blake?

234
00:37:06,297 --> 00:37:08,765
Yes.

235
00:37:17,776 --> 00:37:20,108
Every night...

236
00:37:20,211 --> 00:37:22,111
and every morn',

237
00:37:23,915 --> 00:37:25,815
some to misery
are born.

238
00:37:29,921 --> 00:37:33,084
Every morn'
and every night,

239
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,288
some are born
to sweet delight.

240
00:37:39,165 --> 00:37:41,099
Some are born
to sweet delight.

241
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:45,701
Some are born
to endless night.

242
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:54,476
I really
don't understand.

243
00:37:55,781 --> 00:37:58,716
But I understand,
William Blake.

244
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,810
You were a poet
and a painter.

245
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:06,383
And now, you are
a killer of white men.

246
00:38:13,633 --> 00:38:15,828
You must rest now,
William Blake.

247
00:38:37,157 --> 00:38:39,216
Some are born
to sweet delight.

248
00:38:42,096 --> 00:38:45,361
Some are born
to endless night.

249
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:53,063
Makin' biscuits, Mommy.

250
00:39:02,483 --> 00:39:04,383
Sweetheart.

251
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,991
You didn't touch it,
did you?

252
00:39:15,964 --> 00:39:17,864
- Huh?
- No.

253
00:39:17,966 --> 00:39:19,991
- You swear to me.
- I swear.

254
00:39:22,604 --> 00:39:24,504
Swear to me you're
tellin' the truth.

255
00:39:24,606 --> 00:39:26,506
Yes, I swear I'm
tellin' the truth.

256
00:39:36,151 --> 00:39:39,245
Not a goddamn word
to no one, ever.

257
00:39:39,354 --> 00:39:41,254
You understand?

258
00:39:42,524 --> 00:39:44,856
Don't ever ask me
no questions.

259
00:42:18,051 --> 00:42:19,951
Where are we?

260
00:42:21,688 --> 00:42:23,588
You are being followed,
William Blake.

261
00:42:24,758 --> 00:42:28,558
Are you sure?
I mean, how do you know?

262
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:37,627
Often the evil stench
of white man precedes him.

263
00:42:42,043 --> 00:42:43,943
Why don't we, uh--

264
00:42:45,847 --> 00:42:48,315
Maybe we should, uh--

265
00:42:52,453 --> 00:42:55,354
What should we do?

266
00:42:55,456 --> 00:42:59,688
The eagle never lost so much
time as when he submitted to learn from the crow.

267
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:23,917
Ever wish you were the moon?

268
00:43:25,487 --> 00:43:28,012
Geez, my Henry's cold.

269
00:43:28,123 --> 00:43:30,023
Aw, come on!

270
00:43:32,194 --> 00:43:34,594
My britches been open
like that how long?

271
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:36,721
Only been ridin' a couple
of days together, but Jesus,

272
00:43:36,832 --> 00:43:38,960
one of you fellas could've
mentioned the fact that--

273
00:43:39,068 --> 00:43:41,502
Unsaddle
your goddamn horses.

274
00:43:43,573 --> 00:43:45,939
Unsaddle
your goddamn horse.

275
00:43:48,945 --> 00:43:50,845
Go on.

276
00:43:53,783 --> 00:43:57,617
- Geez.
- An Injun dug this fire pit.

277
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,620
Oh.

278
00:44:01,291 --> 00:44:03,122
Oh, an Indian.

279
00:44:03,226 --> 00:44:05,820
We ain't trackin' no goddamn
Injuns, Cole. I mean, uh,

280
00:44:05,929 --> 00:44:09,262
hell, Dickinson didn't say nothin'
about trackin' no goddamn Injuns.

281
00:44:09,365 --> 00:44:11,300
I mean, the boy's name
is William Blake.

282
00:44:11,402 --> 00:44:15,065
You know a lotta Indians, do ya,
named William Blake? I mean, "Howdy, Chief Billy--"

283
00:44:15,172 --> 00:44:17,106
D'you hear somethin'?

284
00:44:17,208 --> 00:44:19,108
Huh?

285
00:44:20,878 --> 00:44:22,846
- Did ya?
- No. No.

286
00:44:24,281 --> 00:44:26,181
I guess it was nothin'.

287
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,870
You know about Wilson?

288
00:44:51,977 --> 00:44:55,811
- What?
- Do you know about Cole Wilson?

289
00:44:57,916 --> 00:45:00,476
What kinda question is that?
'Course I know about Cole Wilson.

290
00:45:00,585 --> 00:45:02,951
Everybody knows about him.
He's a livin' legend.

291
00:45:03,054 --> 00:45:04,954
Fucked his parents.

292
00:45:08,126 --> 00:45:12,153
- He what?
- He fucked his parents.

293
00:45:16,167 --> 00:45:18,068
- Both of 'em?
- Yeah.

294
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:23,297
Mother. Father. Parents.
Both of 'em. Fucked 'em.

295
00:45:27,546 --> 00:45:29,446
Oh.

296
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:33,150
And you know
what I heard?

297
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,622
After he killed 'em,
he cooked 'em up and ate 'em.

298
00:45:46,165 --> 00:45:48,759
Are you telling me
he killed both his pa--

299
00:45:48,868 --> 00:45:52,930
I'm tellin' you
he killed 'em. He fucked 'em. He cooked 'em up. He ate 'em.

300
00:45:55,676 --> 00:45:58,975
He ain't got a goddamn conscience.
You understand what I'm sayin'?

301
00:45:59,079 --> 00:46:03,413
He'd just as soon slit
our goddamn throats in the middle of the night as walk.

302
00:46:06,653 --> 00:46:09,622
Course, someone
your age,Jesus,

303
00:46:11,391 --> 00:46:13,291
if you was
to put one in him--

304
00:46:15,729 --> 00:46:19,529
"Johnny 'The Kid' Pickett
Slays Cole Wilson."

305
00:46:48,863 --> 00:46:51,661
William Blake,

306
00:46:51,766 --> 00:46:54,064
do you know how
to use this weapon?

307
00:47:01,343 --> 00:47:04,676
- Not really.
- That weapon will replace your tongue.

308
00:47:07,483 --> 00:47:09,951
You will learn
to speak through it,

309
00:47:10,052 --> 00:47:13,613
and your poetry
will now be written with blood.

310
00:47:26,068 --> 00:47:28,002
What is your name?

311
00:47:37,514 --> 00:47:39,448
My name is Nobody.

312
00:47:42,018 --> 00:47:45,681
- Excuse me?
- My name is Exaybachay:

313
00:47:45,789 --> 00:47:48,758
He Who Talks Loud,
Saying Nothing.

314
00:47:52,262 --> 00:47:54,594
He Who Talks--

315
00:47:54,697 --> 00:47:57,495
I thought you said
your name was Nobody.

316
00:47:59,202 --> 00:48:01,262
I prefer
to be called Nobody.

317
00:48:11,182 --> 00:48:13,082
Nobody?

318
00:48:13,184 --> 00:48:17,018
Um, shouldn't you be
with your own tribe or somethin'?

319
00:48:21,392 --> 00:48:23,917
My blood is mixed.

320
00:48:24,028 --> 00:48:27,225
My mother was
Ohm gahpi phi gun ni.

321
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:30,658
My father is
Abso luka.

322
00:48:33,404 --> 00:48:35,930
This mixture
was not respected.

323
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:38,339
As a small boy,

324
00:48:38,443 --> 00:48:40,673
I was often left
to myself.

325
00:48:40,779 --> 00:48:43,976
So I spent many months
stalking the elk people...

326
00:48:44,082 --> 00:48:47,574
to prove I would soon
become a good hunter.

327
00:48:47,686 --> 00:48:51,554
One day, finally,
my elk relatives took pity on me,

328
00:48:51,656 --> 00:48:54,090
and a young elk
gave his life to me.

329
00:48:55,327 --> 00:48:58,558
With only my knife,
I took his life.

330
00:48:58,663 --> 00:49:03,726
As I was preparing to cut the meat,
white men came upon me.

331
00:49:03,835 --> 00:49:05,826
They were English soldiers.

332
00:49:05,937 --> 00:49:10,102
I cut one with my knife, but they
hit me on the head with a rifle.

333
00:49:11,377 --> 00:49:13,743
All went black.

334
00:49:13,846 --> 00:49:15,746
My spirit seemed
to leave me.

335
00:49:18,084 --> 00:49:20,848
I was then taken east...

336
00:49:20,953 --> 00:49:23,922
in a cage.

337
00:49:24,023 --> 00:49:27,356
I was taken to Toronto,
then Philadelphia...

338
00:49:28,861 --> 00:49:30,852
and then to New York.

339
00:49:30,963 --> 00:49:34,694
And each time I arrived
in another city,

340
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,768
somehow the white men
had moved...

341
00:49:36,869 --> 00:49:38,803
all their people there
ahead of me.

342
00:49:41,441 --> 00:49:45,343
Each new city contained
the same white people as the last,

343
00:49:45,445 --> 00:49:48,471
and I could not understand
how a whole city of people...

344
00:49:48,582 --> 00:49:50,482
could be moved
so quickly.

345
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:56,621
Eventually, I was
taken on a ship...

346
00:49:56,723 --> 00:49:59,021
across the great sea...

347
00:49:59,126 --> 00:50:01,185
over to England,

348
00:50:01,295 --> 00:50:03,627
and I was paraded
before them...

349
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:05,857
like a captured animal,

350
00:50:05,966 --> 00:50:07,866
an exhibit.

351
00:50:09,102 --> 00:50:13,005
And so I mimicked them,
imitating their ways,

352
00:50:13,107 --> 00:50:17,373
hoping that they might lose interest
in this young savage,

353
00:50:17,478 --> 00:50:19,844
but their interest
only grew.

354
00:50:19,948 --> 00:50:22,143
So they placed me into
the white man's schools.

355
00:50:24,219 --> 00:50:26,414
It was there
that I discovered...

356
00:50:26,521 --> 00:50:28,785
in a book...

357
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:31,882
the words that you,
William Blake, had written.

358
00:50:34,462 --> 00:50:37,829
They were powerful words,
and they spoke to me.

359
00:50:40,802 --> 00:50:44,738
But I made careful plans,
and I eventually escaped.

360
00:50:47,443 --> 00:50:50,435
Once again, I crossed
the great ocean.

361
00:50:52,114 --> 00:50:54,105
I saw many sad things....

362
00:50:54,216 --> 00:50:57,845
as I made my way back
to the lands of my people.

363
00:50:57,953 --> 00:51:00,888
Once they realized
who I was,

364
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:03,151
the stories of my adventures
angered them.

365
00:51:04,893 --> 00:51:06,793
They called me a liar.

366
00:51:06,895 --> 00:51:11,264
"Exaybachay."
He Who Talks Loud, Saying Nothing.

367
00:51:12,835 --> 00:51:15,360
They ridiculed me.
My own people.

368
00:51:16,939 --> 00:51:19,738
And I was left to wander
the earth alone.

369
00:51:22,912 --> 00:51:24,812
I am Nobody.

370
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:34,712
Ain't ya glad the sun
kind of sets? Prepares you like?

371
00:51:34,824 --> 00:51:38,954
I mean, what if it, like, went
out sudden, like, say, blowin' out a candle or somethin'?

372
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:41,963
I mean-- You know, one minute
we're ridin' along, we can see everything and each other...

373
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:45,626
and, boom, the next minute is just--
you're in total darkness.

374
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:47,930
That'd scare
the bejesus outta me.

375
00:51:52,543 --> 00:51:57,003
Once upon a time,
there were three bears in the forest.

376
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:00,379
A big bear,
a medium mommy bear...

377
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:03,009
and a tiny
little baby bear.

378
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:07,386
One mornin', they were gonna eat
their breakfast porridge.

379
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:11,450
They had a big bowl,
a medium bowl and a tiny little bowl.

380
00:52:11,562 --> 00:52:13,689
That porridge was too hot.

381
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:16,028
Stupid white man.

382
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:21,536
- So they went to take a walk.
- William Blake, you go to them.

383
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:25,098
- Along came this girl. She was--
- What?

384
00:52:27,145 --> 00:52:29,841
Alone? Why don't we
just go around them?

385
00:52:29,948 --> 00:52:32,246
No!

386
00:52:32,351 --> 00:52:34,376
You go.

387
00:52:34,486 --> 00:52:36,386
It's a test.

388
00:52:38,156 --> 00:52:41,887
I don't know those people,
and they don't look very friendly.

389
00:52:41,993 --> 00:52:45,292
- What if they kill me?
- Nobody will observe.

390
00:52:45,397 --> 00:52:48,230
She got sleepy, and she
went into their bedroom.

391
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:51,530
- There was a big bed, a medium
bed and a tiny little bed. - All right.

392
00:52:51,636 --> 00:52:53,763
- I'll go.
- ...their tiny bed.

393
00:52:53,872 --> 00:52:56,432
I'd rather not,
but I'll go.

394
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:59,705
The bears got home.
Papa said,

395
00:52:59,812 --> 00:53:02,542
"Somebody here ate
all our porridge."

396
00:53:04,016 --> 00:53:07,577
-What's the best way to get down there?
-Be quiet and go.

397
00:53:07,687 --> 00:53:09,587
- And he scalped her,
- All right.

398
00:53:09,689 --> 00:53:12,749
and he tore her head
off her body.

399
00:53:12,859 --> 00:53:17,319
And he took that golden hair,
and he made a sweater for baby bear.

400
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:20,228
- That's terrible.
- Tonight we're reminded...

401
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:23,894
of the evil emperor
Nero Augustus.

402
00:53:24,003 --> 00:53:27,734
He was the scourge
of all the Christians.

403
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,933
What's a scourge?

404
00:53:30,043 --> 00:53:33,410
It's-- It's like when
somethin' real bad happens.

405
00:53:33,514 --> 00:53:37,041
Like when everybody gets killed
and you can't do anything about it.

406
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:39,551
Like a swarm of locusts.

407
00:53:39,653 --> 00:53:42,144
For the entertainment
of his guests,

408
00:53:42,256 --> 00:53:44,156
Nero would illuminate
his whole garden...

409
00:53:44,258 --> 00:53:48,194
with bodies of live Christians
covered in burning oil...

410
00:53:48,295 --> 00:53:52,425
strung up
on flaming crosses, crucified.

411
00:53:54,802 --> 00:53:57,771
And at dinner,

412
00:53:57,871 --> 00:54:00,032
he would have the Christians
rubbed by his guards...

413
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:03,804
with aromatic herbs
and garlic...

414
00:54:03,912 --> 00:54:06,904
and sewn up into sacks.

415
00:54:07,015 --> 00:54:10,314
And then they'd throw
these sacks to the wild dogs.

416
00:54:10,418 --> 00:54:12,443
Well, that's terrible.

417
00:54:12,554 --> 00:54:15,955
- It's horrible.
- Terrible's what it is.

418
00:54:17,659 --> 00:54:21,151
You know, I just-- I can't
drink whiskey like I used to could.

419
00:54:21,262 --> 00:54:23,389
My old belly
just ain't no account.

420
00:54:23,498 --> 00:54:25,932
I get the shits every time,
don't you know?

421
00:54:26,034 --> 00:54:28,161
I'm sorry, Big George.

422
00:54:28,269 --> 00:54:32,535
I got some food here that
even Goldilocks never tasted.

423
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,131
I think this is gonna
fix up your old gut.

424
00:54:43,819 --> 00:54:47,277
These beans is shit.

425
00:54:47,389 --> 00:54:50,688
Why don't you shut your goddamn trap
and just eat your beans?

426
00:54:50,793 --> 00:54:55,560
Them, uh-- There's possum
in these beans, and spices too.

427
00:54:55,664 --> 00:54:58,098
- I tried hard.
- Well, Sally,

428
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,100
I don't give a pig's ass
what anybody says.

429
00:55:00,202 --> 00:55:02,432
I still say you make
a hell of a pot of beans.

430
00:55:02,538 --> 00:55:05,996
Now why don't you say us
a grace outta the Good Book, would you?

431
00:55:06,108 --> 00:55:08,737
Thank you, Big George.
I'd be delighted to do that.

432
00:55:15,252 --> 00:55:19,279
"This day will the Lord
deliver thee into mine hand;

433
00:55:19,389 --> 00:55:24,019
And I will smite thee, and
take thine head from thee;

434
00:55:24,127 --> 00:55:28,223
And I will give the carcasses of
the host of the Philistines this day...

435
00:55:28,331 --> 00:55:31,960
unto the fowls of the air
and the wild beasts of the earth."

436
00:55:32,068 --> 00:55:33,968
Amen.

437
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:38,166
- What's a Philistine?
- Well, it's just a real dirty person.

438
00:55:44,415 --> 00:55:47,043
Hello.

439
00:55:47,151 --> 00:55:50,552
I smelled beans.

440
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:54,990
Who are you
travelin' with?

441
00:55:56,427 --> 00:55:58,759
I'm with Nobody.

442
00:55:58,863 --> 00:56:00,763
Where you headed?

443
00:56:03,501 --> 00:56:05,401
I don't know.

444
00:56:10,441 --> 00:56:13,069
- Do you like beans?
- l--

445
00:56:13,177 --> 00:56:15,203
I love beans.

446
00:56:16,782 --> 00:56:19,046
Have you got
any tobacco?

447
00:56:19,151 --> 00:56:22,120
- I'm sorry. I don't smoke.
- Would you give me some tobacco?

448
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:26,554
- I would if I had some.
- I'll trade you some beans for some tobacco.

449
00:56:26,658 --> 00:56:29,149
I don't have any tobacco,
but I'd love some beans.

450
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:31,161
Hurt.

451
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:33,731
- Yes.
- Eyeglasses.

452
00:56:35,734 --> 00:56:38,931
- Yes.
- Pretty suit too.

453
00:56:39,037 --> 00:56:41,335
- I clean up real good, you know.
- Is that right?

454
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,204
- Yeah.
- What size shoes are those?

455
00:56:44,309 --> 00:56:47,541
-Ten.
-They look very comfortable. Are they?

456
00:56:47,647 --> 00:56:50,207
Not too bad.

457
00:56:50,316 --> 00:56:52,807
What kinda flower
is that?

458
00:56:52,919 --> 00:56:56,912
Well, it's a rose...

459
00:56:57,023 --> 00:56:58,923
that's made out of paper.

460
00:56:59,025 --> 00:57:01,687
- Paper?
- Rose. - Now you see there?

461
00:57:05,064 --> 00:57:06,964
- Look at the edge on that knife.
- Hmm.

462
00:57:07,066 --> 00:57:08,966
- Feel that.
- I'd rather not.

463
00:57:09,068 --> 00:57:10,968
Aw, go on.

464
00:57:12,672 --> 00:57:17,006
- Hmm.
- That-- That is a very, very sharp knife, that is.

465
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:19,010
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah. Yeah.

466
00:57:19,112 --> 00:57:21,741
- What do you call it?

467
00:57:22,916 --> 00:57:26,010
- Pretty.
- I'm sorry?

468
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,020
That hat.
What do you call it?

469
00:57:31,191 --> 00:57:33,625
I'm really not sure.

470
00:57:33,727 --> 00:57:36,958
Ah, your hair.
Your hair is soft.

471
00:57:37,064 --> 00:57:39,055
It's like a girl's.

472
00:57:39,166 --> 00:57:41,066
By God, it is soft.

473
00:57:42,903 --> 00:57:44,837
Now how do you
get it that way?

474
00:57:44,938 --> 00:57:49,170
See, this old stuff of mine, it just--
Well, it's just like old barn hay.

475
00:57:49,276 --> 00:57:51,870
- There ain't a durn thing
you can do with it. - Hm.

476
00:57:51,979 --> 00:57:55,347
How do you-- How do you get it
that way and keep it like that?

477
00:57:56,418 --> 00:57:59,012
Just lucky, I guess.

478
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,350
Lucky. Yeah.

479
00:58:01,456 --> 00:58:03,822
Oh, yeah.

480
00:58:03,925 --> 00:58:05,984
Goddamn it.
You keep your hand off of it.

481
00:58:06,094 --> 00:58:08,289
I thought I told you
not to touch me.

482
00:58:08,396 --> 00:58:11,695
I don't give a good goddamn
what you told me. You keep your hands off his hair.

483
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,734
Why? What's that to do
with you then, eh?

484
00:58:13,835 --> 00:58:15,928
That's got plenty to do
with me, goddamn it.

485
00:58:16,037 --> 00:58:18,130
- Really? This one's mine!
- That's right.

486
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:20,639
- This one's yours?
- Yes!

487
00:58:20,742 --> 00:58:23,836
This one's mine, Big George.
You had the last one.

488
00:58:23,945 --> 00:58:26,506
- Is that a fact?
- I saw him first.

489
00:58:26,615 --> 00:58:30,278
I don't give a shit who saw what
and who did what or who did who.

490
00:58:30,386 --> 00:58:33,583
You had the last Philistine.
This one's mine.

491
00:58:33,689 --> 00:58:35,953
If I want this one,
I'll have him, too, by God.

492
00:58:36,058 --> 00:58:40,154
Fine. What happens
if I just shoot you then, eh?

493
00:58:40,262 --> 00:58:42,856
- What do you think about that?
- You gonna shoot me?

494
00:58:42,965 --> 00:58:45,695
- That's right.
- Well, why don't you shoot me then, goddamn it?

495
00:58:45,801 --> 00:58:48,292
- I will. I'll shoot you right now.
- Come on. Shoot me.

496
00:58:48,404 --> 00:58:51,464
- I will.
- Well, quit talkin' about it and do it, by God.

497
00:58:51,574 --> 00:58:53,565
I will.

498
00:58:55,711 --> 00:58:59,944
- There you go.
- Good God, I'm hit! Lord have mercy!

499
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:02,917
Burns like hell fire!
You son of a bitch.

500
00:59:03,019 --> 00:59:05,214
I'm gonna have
to kill somebody now.

501
00:59:11,728 --> 00:59:15,129
Well, goddamn it,
I guess nobody gets you.

502
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,197
What the hell?
- Nobody.

503
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:27,572
Oh, Jesus' bears and squirrels.

504
00:59:35,186 --> 00:59:37,552
I cooked, I cleaned, and I sewed,

505
00:59:37,655 --> 00:59:41,147
and I have
a right to get--

506
00:59:44,061 --> 00:59:47,189
- Yee!

507
00:59:54,972 --> 00:59:56,872
Hootka.

508
01:00:49,095 --> 01:00:50,995
That's me.

509
01:01:05,345 --> 01:01:07,540
Wanted.

510
01:01:09,449 --> 01:01:13,511
"The brutal murders of one Thel Russell
and one Charles Ludlow Dickinson."

511
01:01:17,925 --> 01:01:19,893
I didn't kill Thel.

512
01:01:26,367 --> 01:01:28,267
I didn't kill Thel.

513
01:01:34,108 --> 01:01:36,008
Your actions
are useless.

514
01:01:37,978 --> 01:01:40,811
This is complete fabrication.
There can't be--

515
01:01:48,323 --> 01:01:50,951
You cannot stop the clouds
by the building of a ship.

516
01:01:55,030 --> 01:01:58,090
What? What did you say?

517
01:02:00,869 --> 01:02:03,497
You know, I've had it up to here
with this Indian malarkey.

518
01:02:03,605 --> 01:02:08,565
I haven't understood
a single word you've said since I met you, not one single word.

519
01:02:09,811 --> 01:02:12,507
Are you sure
you have no tobacco?

520
01:02:12,614 --> 01:02:15,310
I've already told you
I don't smoke.

521
01:02:15,417 --> 01:02:19,821
If I don't smoke, there's a pretty good
chance that I don't have any tobacco.

522
01:02:23,726 --> 01:02:25,956
William Blake.

523
01:03:06,603 --> 01:03:10,664
I guess the best advice
just not to take any damn advice.

524
01:03:10,774 --> 01:03:12,674
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

525
01:03:14,978 --> 01:03:17,037
What the hell...

526
01:03:17,147 --> 01:03:19,081
is that?

527
01:03:31,896 --> 01:03:33,989
What's that say?

528
01:03:34,098 --> 01:03:35,998
Read it.

529
01:03:38,169 --> 01:03:41,570
- "Wanted: William Blake."
- Huh?

530
01:03:41,672 --> 01:03:44,698
"In the amount of $500."

531
01:03:46,377 --> 01:03:48,277
Shit.

532
01:03:50,515 --> 01:03:54,451
Hell, ain't we about more fucked
than a whore at closin' time, huh?

533
01:03:54,552 --> 01:03:58,114
Thanks to goddamn
Mr. Dickinson, huh?

534
01:03:58,223 --> 01:04:00,714
I'll tell you what
that there says, huh?

535
01:04:00,826 --> 01:04:04,318
It says some
pelt-wearin' trapper,

536
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:09,629
some stinkin' bean-suckin'
possum skinner, he's gonna collect that reward money.

537
01:04:10,836 --> 01:04:13,771
Make you feel good?
Huh?

538
01:04:13,872 --> 01:04:16,397
- Goddamn pelt skinner.
- I'll be damn.

539
01:04:16,508 --> 01:04:19,602
Five hundred dollars.
I don't understand.

540
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:24,307
I thought we was hired exclusive.
I mean, he paid us in gold in advance.

541
01:04:24,416 --> 01:04:27,749
I'm out here-- I'm out here
in the middle of shits creek...

542
01:04:27,854 --> 01:04:29,754
with two local lunatics.

543
01:04:29,856 --> 01:04:31,915
One who don't
say nothin'--

544
01:04:32,025 --> 01:04:35,392
And the other one,
he won't never stop yappin'!

545
01:04:35,495 --> 01:04:39,659
- You gonna shed tears for us?

546
01:04:56,149 --> 01:04:58,413
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

547
01:05:03,591 --> 01:05:07,527
- And why not?
- Because it ain't good for your health.

548
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,764
Fuck you.

549
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:15,631
- Fuck me?

550
01:05:15,736 --> 01:05:17,636
Fuck you.

551
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,421
Goddamn it.

552
01:05:35,657 --> 01:05:37,557
Jesus, Cole.

553
01:05:39,427 --> 01:05:41,827
He's just a kid.

554
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:45,532
He's a Navajo mud toy now.

555
01:05:47,169 --> 01:05:49,069
Yeah.

556
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,780
Aho.

557
01:07:17,862 --> 01:07:21,161
I have just ingested...

558
01:07:21,266 --> 01:07:23,166
the food of the Great Spirit...

559
01:07:24,435 --> 01:07:26,335
and Father Peyote.

560
01:07:27,705 --> 01:07:30,003
Do you think I could have
a little bite of it?

561
01:07:33,611 --> 01:07:36,546
It's not for use
even for William Blake.

562
01:07:37,749 --> 01:07:40,877
Flowers of the medicine...

563
01:07:40,985 --> 01:07:44,443
give you sacred visions
that are not for you right now.

564
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:51,354
My southern brothers were
prohibited from using it...

565
01:07:52,631 --> 01:07:54,531
by the Spanish devils.

566
01:07:55,768 --> 01:07:57,759
But now,

567
01:07:58,871 --> 01:08:01,840
even the Notoemne
and the Dene...

568
01:08:03,842 --> 01:08:06,174
know of its loving ways.

569
01:09:17,518 --> 01:09:19,577
What?

570
01:09:19,687 --> 01:09:21,917
What are you lookin' at?

571
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:09,037
William Blake.

572
01:10:11,307 --> 01:10:14,743
It's so strange that
you don't remember any of your poetry.

573
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:21,241
I don't know anything about poetry.

574
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:23,250
Oh, you're so modest.

575
01:10:32,396 --> 01:10:34,296
Listen...

576
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,300
I feel very weak.

577
01:10:41,171 --> 01:10:43,605
I'm hungry.

578
01:10:45,275 --> 01:10:49,439
Quest for vision is a great blessing,
William Blake.

579
01:10:49,546 --> 01:10:53,380
To do so, one must go
without food and water.

580
01:10:55,319 --> 01:10:58,117
All the sacred spirits...

581
01:10:58,222 --> 01:11:00,122
recognize
those who fast.

582
01:11:01,992 --> 01:11:04,928
It's good to prepare
for a journey in this way.

583
01:11:15,173 --> 01:11:18,472
I seem to have
misplaced my eyeglasses.

584
01:11:22,146 --> 01:11:24,080
I can't see clearly.

585
01:11:30,955 --> 01:11:34,083
Perhaps you will see
more clearly without them.

586
01:11:36,128 --> 01:11:38,028
You're a very strange man.

587
01:11:42,801 --> 01:11:45,167
Very strange.

588
01:12:24,144 --> 01:12:26,704
May the Great Spirit
watch over you, William Blake.

589
01:12:57,979 --> 01:12:59,879
Nobody?

590
01:13:12,259 --> 01:13:14,160
Nobody?

591
01:13:19,601 --> 01:13:22,195
Nobody?

592
01:13:27,509 --> 01:13:29,409
Nobody?

593
01:14:30,474 --> 01:14:33,466
- Hey, Marvin.
- What?

594
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,449
How come Dickinson's telegram didn't
give no description of the horse...

595
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:41,518
this murderin'
fucker stole?

596
01:14:41,618 --> 01:14:45,247
It did, Lee. A pinto,
just like that one.

597
01:14:50,327 --> 01:14:54,560
White legs, brown ass,
brown sides.

598
01:14:54,666 --> 01:14:57,464
It did? I don't think
it did, Marvin.

599
01:14:57,569 --> 01:15:02,199
Well, you asshole-- You got the damn
telegram on you. Take it out and look.

600
01:15:02,307 --> 01:15:04,969
That's right. Yeah, I got it here.
I'll check it.

601
01:15:06,644 --> 01:15:09,511
Maybe I been thinkin'
of them wanted posters.

602
01:15:19,924 --> 01:15:22,222
Lee! It's him!

603
01:15:26,866 --> 01:15:29,562
You William Blake?

604
01:15:29,668 --> 01:15:31,659
Yes, I am.

605
01:15:33,272 --> 01:15:35,604
Do you know my poetry?

606
01:16:21,822 --> 01:16:26,225
Some are born
to endless night.

607
01:16:45,213 --> 01:16:47,477
Well, Rome weren't built
in a day, Cole.

608
01:16:47,582 --> 01:16:50,881
Course, uh, I wasn't
overseein' that particular job.

609
01:17:24,119 --> 01:17:26,781
Fresh kill.

610
01:17:29,391 --> 01:17:32,087
Yeah. No damn tobacco,
that's for sure.

611
01:17:33,829 --> 01:17:37,857
This, uh, some kind
of telegram or somethin'?

612
01:17:37,967 --> 01:17:39,867
What's that say?

613
01:17:41,504 --> 01:17:43,699
Dickinson again.

614
01:17:43,806 --> 01:17:49,301
Oh, goddamn Dickinson. You mean
to tell me he's even got the law involved in this now?

615
01:17:49,412 --> 01:17:51,312
Jesus.

616
01:17:53,483 --> 01:17:57,977
Tell you one thing. FL, uh, that there
Blake fella keeps on shootin' marshals,

617
01:17:59,422 --> 01:18:02,084
I'll wind up
likin' the bastard.

618
01:18:09,565 --> 01:18:12,467
Looks like a goddamn
religious icon.

619
01:18:40,331 --> 01:18:42,629
Anyhow, greenback
to the beginning of the story,

620
01:18:42,733 --> 01:18:44,998
my granddaddy come over
from Scotland, you see.

621
01:18:45,103 --> 01:18:47,537
He was actually part of
the Mactwill clan.

622
01:18:47,639 --> 01:18:53,009
Uh, the, uh, clan tartan
was kind of gold and purple, if I remember correctly.

623
01:18:53,111 --> 01:18:55,443
I never wore
a lick of it myself.

624
01:18:55,547 --> 01:18:58,209
Dropped the "Mac" part of the name
when he decided to come out West...

625
01:18:58,316 --> 01:19:01,149
on account of he figured
it'd get him more work and all.

626
01:19:01,252 --> 01:19:04,813
How 'bout your family history
there, Cole? Let me guess.

627
01:19:04,923 --> 01:19:08,484
Kind of figured you for a German, huh?
I mean, am I right?

628
01:19:08,593 --> 01:19:10,686
Am I close?

629
01:19:10,795 --> 01:19:13,195
Austrian?

630
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:09,045
I'd like to speak with
Mr. Dickinson, please.

631
01:20:12,325 --> 01:20:16,022
- I insist on speaking
with Mr. Dickinson.

632
01:22:59,798 --> 01:23:02,130
Goddamn redskins.

633
01:26:38,523 --> 01:26:41,219
Oh!

634
01:26:52,237 --> 01:26:55,138
- Nobody?
- William Blake.

635
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:17,323
- She's upset.

636
01:27:56,403 --> 01:27:59,429
- She's beautiful.

637
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:09,639
- She didn't mean to call you that.
- Huh?

638
01:28:09,751 --> 01:28:12,845
But you sure interrupted
a very romantic moment, William Blake.

639
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:14,854
Oh. I'm sorry.

640
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:18,016
You stay here 'til I return.

641
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:37,504
Don't let the sun burn
a hole in your ass, William Blake.

642
01:28:37,613 --> 01:28:40,912
Rise now and drive
your cart and plow...

643
01:28:41,016 --> 01:28:42,950
over the bones
of the dead.

644
01:28:45,387 --> 01:28:47,287
Do you still have
my eyeglasses?

645
01:28:47,389 --> 01:28:50,324
No. I traded 'em.

646
01:28:50,426 --> 01:28:54,692
- You traded them?
- Do you have any tobacco?

647
01:28:55,864 --> 01:28:58,856
No. I traded it.

648
01:28:58,968 --> 01:29:03,064
- For what?
- I'm not telling.

649
01:29:04,506 --> 01:29:07,839
- Liar.
- Thief.

650
01:30:16,915 --> 01:30:21,477
I don't care if you were
married 16 times

651
01:30:23,155 --> 01:30:25,953
I still love you

652
01:30:26,058 --> 01:30:28,618
Yo-ho yo-ho-yo

653
01:30:35,701 --> 01:30:39,398
I will take you to
the bridge made of waters.

654
01:30:39,504 --> 01:30:42,667
The mirror.

655
01:30:42,774 --> 01:30:45,709
Then you will be taken up
to the next level of the world.

656
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:50,378
The place where
William Blake is from.

657
01:30:50,483 --> 01:30:52,474
Where his spirit belongs.

658
01:30:54,187 --> 01:30:58,283
I must make sure that you pass back
through the mirror at the place...

659
01:30:58,391 --> 01:31:00,291
where the sea
meets the sky.

660
01:31:43,871 --> 01:31:45,702
White man's
trading post.

661
01:31:47,875 --> 01:31:49,809
Indians get
diseases there.

662
01:31:51,111 --> 01:31:53,012
What do you mean?

663
01:31:53,114 --> 01:31:55,412
Smallpox,
consumption.

664
01:31:57,585 --> 01:31:59,485
Blankets are infected.

665
01:32:00,755 --> 01:32:02,723
It spreads
through the villages.

666
01:32:06,728 --> 01:32:08,719
I see you have acquired
a new weapon.

667
01:32:08,830 --> 01:32:11,924
Hmm? Oh, yes.
A Winchester.

668
01:32:13,334 --> 01:32:16,303
- Here. Take it.
- No.

669
01:32:16,404 --> 01:32:18,736
No, really.
Take it.

670
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:20,865
I took it off
a dead white man.

671
01:32:20,975 --> 01:32:24,103
Did William Blake
kill this white man?

672
01:32:26,949 --> 01:32:28,849
Yes.

673
01:32:30,219 --> 01:32:32,153
William Blake killed
the white man.

674
01:32:46,535 --> 01:32:48,560
We need a canoe.

675
01:33:28,078 --> 01:33:29,978
Water.

676
01:34:06,718 --> 01:34:10,313
"The brutal murders of Charles Dickinson
and fiance, Thel Russell.

677
01:34:12,090 --> 01:34:14,615
Also the murders of
the following territorial marshals...

678
01:34:14,726 --> 01:34:19,754
...deputy... Big George Drakoulious,

679
01:34:19,865 --> 01:34:25,269
Benmont Tench
and one Salvatore Sally Jenko."

680
01:34:26,672 --> 01:34:29,470
- It's not bad.
- Huh?

681
01:34:29,574 --> 01:34:32,236
It's not a bad illustration
of you, William Blake.

682
01:34:38,751 --> 01:34:42,448
Well, I want you
to have it.

683
01:34:42,555 --> 01:34:45,251
- It's a present.
- Aho.

684
01:35:03,076 --> 01:35:06,603
Good morning.
May you serve the Lord,

685
01:35:06,713 --> 01:35:09,443
and may His holy dominion
guide you through your dismal life.

686
01:35:09,549 --> 01:35:12,348
How can I be of assistance,
my poor man?

687
01:35:12,453 --> 01:35:14,353
All our ammunition
is guaranteed.

688
01:35:14,455 --> 01:35:18,482
This latest batch was,
in fact, personally blessed by the archbishop of Detroit.

689
01:35:27,201 --> 01:35:29,863
Good morning.

690
01:35:29,970 --> 01:35:34,202
May our Lord Jesus Christ
wash this earth with His holy light...

691
01:35:34,308 --> 01:35:39,974
and purge its darkest places
from heathens and philistines.

692
01:35:41,315 --> 01:35:45,116
The vision of Christ
that thou dost see...

693
01:35:45,220 --> 01:35:48,053
is my vision's
greatest enemy.

694
01:35:58,767 --> 01:36:00,667
Do you have tobacco?

695
01:36:01,770 --> 01:36:04,261
We sure don't.

696
01:36:04,372 --> 01:36:07,739
Aren't those tins of tobacco
right there behind you?

697
01:36:07,842 --> 01:36:11,005
Sure are, but
those cans are empty.

698
01:36:12,447 --> 01:36:15,576
There's no tobacco in them.

699
01:36:15,684 --> 01:36:18,983
Perhaps I could interest you
in some beads...

700
01:36:20,689 --> 01:36:22,589
or possibly a blanket.

701
01:36:25,294 --> 01:36:27,194
Blanket.

702
01:36:29,899 --> 01:36:31,833
Yes, my fine fellow.
Ammunition.

703
01:36:33,402 --> 01:36:36,269
Uh, I'd like some
tobacco, please.

704
01:36:39,308 --> 01:36:43,938
Well, I may have
one or two twists left.

705
01:36:45,681 --> 01:36:48,149
From my personal supply,
you understand.

706
01:36:51,254 --> 01:36:53,381
For good friends only.

707
01:37:00,030 --> 01:37:02,021
Good Lord.

708
01:37:04,067 --> 01:37:05,967
You're William Blake.

709
01:37:09,206 --> 01:37:11,504
Yes, I am.

710
01:37:11,608 --> 01:37:14,543
By the grace
of the Lord Almighty.

711
01:37:14,644 --> 01:37:18,273
Sir, would it be presumptuous
of me to ask you for...

712
01:37:21,786 --> 01:37:23,686
for your autograph?

713
01:37:27,925 --> 01:37:31,759
Please, kind sir.
It would be a great honor.

714
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:38,300
Pardon me.

715
01:37:46,310 --> 01:37:48,676
There's
my autograph.

716
01:37:51,849 --> 01:37:55,251
God damn your soul
to the fires of hell.

717
01:37:59,491 --> 01:38:01,686
He already has.

718
01:38:23,482 --> 01:38:25,382
Hootka.

719
01:38:28,821 --> 01:38:31,381
I'm tired.

720
01:38:36,663 --> 01:38:38,563
I'll free the horses.

721
01:39:36,992 --> 01:39:40,325
I see you collected
some more white man's metal.

722
01:39:40,428 --> 01:39:43,886
Yes. I seem to be
a magnet for it.

723
01:39:45,567 --> 01:39:47,660
Ohh, man.

724
01:39:51,206 --> 01:39:53,197
Good day for
a canoe ride.

725
01:41:32,110 --> 01:41:34,806
Nobody?

726
01:41:37,315 --> 01:41:40,682
Is this the boat...

727
01:41:40,785 --> 01:41:42,980
that'll take me across
the mirror of water?

728
01:41:44,355 --> 01:41:47,257
No.

729
01:41:47,359 --> 01:41:49,418
This boat's not strong enough,
William Blake.

730
01:42:06,111 --> 01:42:11,811
William Blake
is a legend now

731
01:42:11,917 --> 01:42:14,442
He's a good friend
of mine

732
01:45:34,025 --> 01:45:35,994
Stand up,
William Blake.

733
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:43,400
William Blake.

734
01:45:45,237 --> 01:45:47,262
Ah.

735
01:46:17,904 --> 01:46:19,838
Walk proudly,
William Blake.

736
01:48:23,534 --> 01:48:26,765
That man there?
I know him.

737
01:48:29,706 --> 01:48:32,698
He's a great builder
of sea canoes.

738
01:53:13,431 --> 01:53:15,332
Hello.

739
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:22,739
I prepared your canoe
with cedar boughs.

740
01:53:25,144 --> 01:53:29,137
It's time for you
to leave now, William Blake.

741
01:53:29,248 --> 01:53:32,445
Time for you to go back
to where you came from.

742
01:53:36,288 --> 01:53:38,756
You mean Cleveland?

743
01:53:38,858 --> 01:53:41,952
Back to the place where
all the spirits came from...

744
01:53:43,229 --> 01:53:45,697
and where all
the spirits return.

745
01:53:49,336 --> 01:53:51,736
This world will
no longer concern you.

746
01:54:03,650 --> 01:54:05,641
Found some tobacco.

747
01:54:07,220 --> 01:54:11,122
The tobacco
is for your voyage,

748
01:54:11,224 --> 01:54:13,385
William Blake.

749
01:54:24,872 --> 01:54:26,772
Nobody.

750
01:54:27,909 --> 01:54:29,809
I don't smoke.

751
01:54:53,769 --> 01:54:55,737
Aho, William Blake.
