1
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:00,652
<i>Now the story goes that
John Denver, he was</i>

2
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:04,231
playin' at this little ol' place called
the Cellar Door in Washington, D.C...

3
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,735
around Christmas time in 1970.

4
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,663
His opening act was
this husband and wife duo,

5
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,408
named Bill Danoff
and Taffy Nivert

6
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,914
and they called
themself Fat City.

7
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:19,167
That's kind of a funny name.

8
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:23,251
Yeah, that is kind of a funny name.
Socket, uh, 5/8ths.

9
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:30,390
Now, one night, they decide
to go on back to the house

10
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,559
and have a little jam session.

11
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,062
On the way,
they got into an accident

12
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,391
and John Denver,
he broke his thumb.

13
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,943
And when they finally
got back to the house,

14
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,520
and Bill and Taffy played him,

15
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,732
played John Denver this song
they'd been working on,

16
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:48,238
he flipped for it, man.

17
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,619
And they worked on
that thing till dawn.

18
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:51,695
Screwdriver.

19
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,031
Flat head or Phillips?
Flat.

20
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,538
So that's why you like the song.

21
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,871
Well, I like the song
because of the song.

22
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,376
I mean, I guess I also like it

23
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,215
'cause it's got
a story behind it.

24
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,298
You know,
Bill Danoff later said that

25
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,220
he ain't never even
been to West Virginia.

26
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,139
Well, I like the song, too,

27
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,514
but I don't really think
it'll work for the pageant.

28
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:15,890
Pliers.

29
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,391
Regular or needle-nose?

30
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:18,563
Needle.

31
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,562
So you comin' to my rehearsal?

32
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,732
Yeah. I'm gonna pick
you up right after work.

33
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,534
Just so you know, I asked Mommy

34
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:33,032
if she and Moody would
pay for your cell phone.

35
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,910
She said even if they did,
you wouldn't take it.

36
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,241
Sadie bug, she's right.

37
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,248
The only thing

38
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,418
I need a cell phone for
is takin' pictures of you.

39
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,756
Gun show!

40
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,928
Hey, Daddy.
Nope.

41
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,457
All right.

42
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,320
What say, Cal?

43
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,615
Hey, hey, Jimmy. Come on in.
Shut that door, would you?

44
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,163
Yeah.
Have a seat.

45
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,794
Jimmy, I'm just gonna say it.
I got to let you go.

46
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,882
Cal, I... I didn't
even do nothin', man.

47
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,592
I know you didn't do nothin'.

48
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,598
But last week, someone
in H.R. saw you leaving,

49
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,307
walking out to your truck
and they saw you was limpin'.

50
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,938
So?

51
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,237
My leg ain't got nothin' to do
with drivin' that Case out there.

52
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,312
I know that.

53
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,954
I know, but the folks over in the
big office, they feel different.

54
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,609
And they said you didn't
list it on your paperwork

55
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,989
when you was first brought on.

56
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,446
No.
They are callin' it

57
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,280
a "pre-existing condition"

58
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,206
and that it is
a liability issue.

59
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,784
Okay, this big then. What
is that, two to three feet?

60
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:48,043
This big and you let me drive my
truck around the track tonight.

61
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,865
Look, it's a four-wheel drive.
It isn't gonna hurt you.

62
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,420
Almost heaven

63
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,085
<i>West Virginia</i>

64
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:41,092
<i>Blue Ridge Mountains
Shenandoah River</i>

65
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,271
<i>Purple Lady,
you know my brother, Jimmy?</i>

66
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:54,317
Oh,
Jimmy Logan, that ball player

67
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,319
that was gonna be a big deal?

68
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,441
Hey, Purple Lady.

69
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,912
My husband, the Major,
when he was still alive,

70
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,206
he loved LSU football.

71
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,955
Whenever they'd show the games
here local, we'd watch.

72
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,745
Of course for me,
it was all about the uniforms.

73
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,547
Their jerseys are the most
striking shade of purple.

74
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,669
Purple.

75
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:17,548
Yes. Purple and gold.
Royal colors.

76
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,674
Yeah, I got off early,

77
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,676
so I figured I'd take Sadie
on over to her dance thing,

78
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,098
so you didn't have to drive her.

79
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,054
Well, that's great and all,

80
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,886
you wanting to see your
daughter dance and everything.

81
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,642
But it was yesterday.

82
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,306
Shit.

83
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:30,770
Excuse you.

84
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,476
I got her there fine,
by the way.

85
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,394
See, most people think

86
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,605
if you're gonna go to
Charleston, then, duh,

87
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,736
you get on the 85 to Danville,

88
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,819
then the I-19
to Charleston. 54 miles.

89
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,699
But, bein' 4:00 p.m.,

90
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,327
I knew not the best time
of day to be on the road.

91
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,867
And they're still doing

92
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,793
all that shoulder
work on the I-19.

93
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,088
Plus, then you got
the sun right in your eyes

94
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,962
for that whole
stretch outside of Julian.

95
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,922
So, yeah,
I took the 85 to Danville,

96
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,629
but then I hopped onto the 3,

97
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,760
so instead of goin' up and over,

98
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,512
I'm goin' over and then up.

99
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,143
And after that it was a straight
shot on the Daniel Boone Parkway

100
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,561
all the way to Marmet.

101
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,856
Well, sure sounds
like you love to drive.

102
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,309
It was just a rehearsal,
not like the real pageant,

103
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,485
but Bobbie Jo is not happy.

104
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,028
Now, why didn't you call me'?

105
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,815
I tried, but your cell phone
seems to have been turned off.

106
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,321
You should pay your bills.
Everyone needs a cell phone.

107
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,868
But I don't like 'em.

108
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,154
You one of them Unabomber types?

109
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,537
Yeah. lam one of
them Unabomber types.

110
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,497
See, I don't like people
tellin' me what to do,

111
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,044
like, "Answer the phone."

112
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,050
Hey.
Oh, this is gonna be good.

113
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,686
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry, I thought...

114
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,021
I knew it was 4:00,

115
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,849
I just thought
it was 4:00 today.

116
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,401
That's the first time
you've used that excuse!

117
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,483
Look, I said I was sorry,
all right?

118
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,521
Mellie said y'all figured it
out just fine anyway.

119
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,858
She also tell you
that she got pulled over

120
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,568
goin' 30 miles
over the speed limit

121
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,532
with my daughter in the car?

122
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,783
It's our daughter.

123
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,536
Sadie said her Aunt Mellie
"worked her Mellie magic"

124
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,538
and talked the cops
into not givin' her a ticket!

125
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,165
So that's a real good
character-building experience

126
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,417
for our daughter to witness.

127
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:17,706
Yeah.
Don't laugh at me!

128
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,544
Yeah, whatever, forget it. What's
up with the sale sign out there?

129
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,424
You didn't tell me you and
Moody was buyin' a new house.

130
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,055
Daddy!
Hey!

131
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,348
Ah!

132
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,176
What you doing?
Nothing.

133
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,306
Ow! Ow. Man!

134
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,351
Hey, <i>me</i> and, uh, your momma
were just talkin' about

135
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,398
maybe me and you goin' to get
some ice cream.

136
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,942
I'm not allowed
ice cream anymore.

137
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:39,436
Says who?

138
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,151
Mommy. She says it's
got too many calories

139
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,232
and that nobody
loves a fat girl.

140
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:48,287
You ain't... I... I think
that's a little bit harsh.

141
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,828
This is some of that

142
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,453
co-parenting stuff that you
and I need to talk about.

143
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,284
That Doctor Phil stuff.

144
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,709
Hey, Jimmy!

145
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,911
Hey, Moody.

146
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,835
Yeah, what's goin' on, sweetie?
Wow. Thank you.

147
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,800
Hey, hey! Hey, you two don't settle
down, we ain't gonna get no mall.

148
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,636
Daddy, will you come with?

149
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,922
We're takin' Sadie
and the boys to see that...

150
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,765
That new, uh, Furious
<i>Fast</i> movie at the mall.

151
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,798
You want in?

152
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,559
Uh...

153
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,234
That's a little... That's a little
intense for the kids, ain't it?

154
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,264
They love it.
Keeps 'em quiet.

155
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,067
They sit there starin' at the screen
the whole time, scared shitless.

156
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,144
- You want to come?
- Please?

157
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,356
I got to get going
to work. You know?

158
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,942
I ain't got time
for a whole movie.

159
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,494
But you go and have fun.
Give me a hug.

160
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,659
Not on my back.

161
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:32,822
But we're gonna
get some ice cream.

162
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:33,998
Promise?
Okay.

163
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,952
But it's got to be yogurt, 'cause
I got the pageant comin' up.

164
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,195
Oh, I finally know what
song I'm gonna sing for talent.

165
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,840
What song?
Umbrella by Rihanna.

166
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,443
When Rihanna sings Umbrella,

167
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,798
she's not really
singing about a rain umbrella,

168
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,176
she's really singing about
her vagina. It's code.

169
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,764
Who told you that?

170
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,841
Everybody.

171
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,007
Come on, let's go!
Everyone in the Expedition.

172
00:09:54,037 --> 00:09:54,453
Whoo!

173
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,145
Hey, kiss your
mother when you leave.

174
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,768
Kiss.
Kiss. Aw. Thank you.

175
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,190
See you, sweetie.
Bye.

176
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,985
Hey.
Yep?

177
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,529
- I wasn't done talkin' to you yet.
- Okay.

178
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,682
What am I in trouble for now?

179
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,654
We need to talk
about some legal stuff.

180
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,485
Hey, uh, Jimmy, uh, your car.

181
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,366
Moody, can ya give us a minute?

182
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,446
Okay.

183
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,873
Legal stuff?

184
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,667
- You was askin' about the "For Sale" sign?
- Yeah.

185
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,961
Moody's expanding-

186
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,664
His family's openin' up a new
dealership down in Lynchburg.

187
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,588
That's across state line.

188
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,169
Hell, no,
you can't just tell me that,

189
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:28,629
like I ain't got no
say in the matter.

190
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:32,090
You'll still get your days!
Just we'll be in Lynchburg.

191
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,346
You can drive across the
state line to pick her up.

192
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,098
I have full custody.

193
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,850
It's not happenin'.
I'm getting a lawyer.

194
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,727
With what money?

195
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,903
What do you say there, Earl?
Hey, Jimmy.

196
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,652
So...

197
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,498
- I've been uncoverin' a lot.
- Oh, shit.

198
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,622
Did you know
Aunt Maggie, in 1983,

199
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,544
won the Lotto,
but washed the ticket...

200
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,213
It's folk tales
and backwood gossip.

201
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,166
Well, you got to
admit this kind of stuff

202
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,546
don't happen to normal folk.

203
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,672
Not tonight, Clyde.

204
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,752
Well, there's a pattern.
Just...

205
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:13,181
Pappaw's diamond, Uncle
Stickley's electrocution.

206
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:16,180
Mommy gets sick
after Daddy's settlement.

207
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,511
The roof collapse.
Come on, Clyde.

208
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:18,971
You blow your knee out

209
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,930
and a roadside mine takes my arm

210
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,442
<i>as</i> I was transpo-in' out.
I was almost at the airport.

211
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,274
What about Mellie, then?

212
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,731
Ain't nothin' bad
ever happened to Mellie.

213
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,233
Hmm?

214
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,615
What?

215
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,952
You just gave it a mouth.

216
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,751
You need to take it back.

217
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,124
I don't even
know what I'm tak...

218
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,715
I'm gonna go to
my satellite office

219
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,632
and then we're
gonna talk about this.

220
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,469
See, the dirty big secret is

221
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,809
that I am
the asset in this scenario,

222
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,606
it's not Dayton White. Right?

223
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,480
And the simple fact is I'd
be driving that car myself,

224
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,772
if my day job wasn't running
a billion dollar company.

225
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,654
You know? And by the way, it was my
understanding that this is America, people.

226
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:17,116
So them trying to muzzle the company
that I created, in America,

227
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,993
is a violation
of my free speech.

228
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,998
And plus, plus,
two of those kids

229
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,833
only had one
kidney to begin with.

230
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,759
So, why isn't
anybody writin' about that?

231
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,496
Right. It's total B.S.

232
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,498
What do you like?

233
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:29,920
Aw.

234
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,751
I just thought of
a great song title,

235
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,383
<i>The Kindness of
a One-Armed Bartender.</i>

236
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,385
Oi, go on!

237
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,351
Uh... Now, you see,
I got two arms.

238
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,559
See? I'm a trans-radial amputee,

239
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:46,517
so it's my lower forearm
and hand that's missing.

240
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,851
My mistake.
I'm very lucky.

241
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,316
I guess I'll settle
for a Stoli, extra dry,

242
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,148
two olives.
Can you handle that?

243
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,734
Uh, yeah.
Up or on the rocks?

244
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:56,818
Up.

245
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,201
Well, it's pretty good.
Could be colder.

246
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,913
Ice shortage around here, 'cause
of the water contamination plant

247
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,544
from the chemical leak upstream.

248
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,044
Hey, do you mind doin'
that drink thing again?

249
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,754
I want to shoot a post.

250
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:01,717
I got 1.2 million followers.
This could make you famous.

251
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,679
How about he bounce a damn
ball on his nose for you next,

252
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,230
like a trained seal?

253
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:10,225
Sorry.
You got a problem?

254
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:11,901
Yeah, I got a problem.

255
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,729
I take exception to people
messing with my brother.

256
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,611
That's two tours
in Iraq right there.

257
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,901
He stepped forward when
others were steppin' back.

258
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,203
So you need to
show a little respect.

259
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,959
Thank you for your service.
And cheers.

260
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,294
So, brothers, eh?

261
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,627
You know, it's funny. With your
bad leg and his missin' an arm,

262
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,883
excuse me, hand...

263
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,442
it's like the two
of you almost add up

264
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:44,305
to one normal person.

265
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,723
Oh, man, I know who you are.

266
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,651
You're that... You're that guy
on the TV with the drink.

267
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,154
I mean, you're famous!

268
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,437
Right on both.

269
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,279
I'm that guy on the TV with the
drink and, yes, I'm famous.

270
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,405
Very, very famous.

271
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,861
Hey, can I get a photo with you?

272
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:03,945
Sure.
Yeah?

273
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,228
Sure. You know, the guys at
the garage won't believe me.

274
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,995
Make it quick
Hold on. Come on.

275
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,462
Oh, that's nice.
There we go. All right.

276
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,174
Hey, what the...

277
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,260
- Hi, Earl. You got a light?
- Well...

278
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,179
Always. Here.

279
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:32,857
Ah, thank you.

280
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,320
Stay down! Stay down!

281
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,872
- Leo! Leo!
- It's on fire.

282
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:59,050
That is massively stupid!
That's an $85,000 vehicle!

283
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,377
Well, he was assaulted.

284
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,713
He tried to assault me!

285
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,471
Well, don't just stand there gawping.
Get your phones out!

286
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,724
Right, Max, all right, the phone.
Film this! Document!

287
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,065
Hey!
Aw.

288
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,904
Christ!

289
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:26,911
Cauliflower.

290
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,035
Yeah, this is Max.
Get Mike on the phone.

291
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,707
What did he just say?

292
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,545
You can't just walk away!
This is a crime scene!

293
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,420
Did you just say
"cauliflower" to me?

294
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,758
<i>Unless I'm mistaken</i>

295
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,343
yesterday,
as you were leavin' the bar,

296
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,089
you said
the word "cauliflower."

297
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,967
That's right. I did.

298
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,104
The last time you
said that word to me,

299
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,773
I ended up gettin'
sent down for six months.

300
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,479
It was juvie.

301
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,651
I was 13.

302
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,438
And you were supposed to be
the lookout, now, weren't you?

303
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,114
Bein' that I was
your kid brother,

304
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,987
I let you lead me into trouble

305
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,907
with all your crazy
"cauliflower" plans.

306
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,284
My life of crime is over.

307
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,409
But you did make
breakfast this morning.

308
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,119
Even burned
the bacon like I like

309
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,670
and you hate.

310
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,503
I also saw you have some
sort of robbery "to do" list.

311
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:08,512
Now, I know this attempt to be
organized is a big step for you.

312
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,181
So go.

313
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,188
Charlotte Motor Speedway.

314
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,600
The Speedway?

315
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,359
<i>It's one of the busiest
sports venues in the country.</i>

316
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,694
<i>Just last year,
they had over 300 events.</i>

317
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,706
<i>It's the official home
of NASCAR, of course.</i>

318
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,828
<i>That's all run on
that main track.</i>

319
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,371
<i>But that place right there
ain't just about racing.</i>

320
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,545
<i>This place is like a city.</i>

321
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,547
<i>A few years ago, they built
condos for people who wanted</i>

322
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,005
<i>to live above the track all year long.
They sold out in less than 24 hours.</i>

323
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,257
<i>They even got their own
police force and jail</i>

324
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,556
<i>for people carryin' on
and getting out of hand.</i>

325
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,093
Do you hear the words
comin' out your mouth?

326
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,520
"They have their
own police force."

327
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,724
I'm midway
through my presentation,

328
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:05,062
so you can just not interrupt
me and let me get it out.

329
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:09,069
How many times have I listened to that
Logan Family Curse thing of yours?

330
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,077
Thank you.

331
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,747
Now, as you very well know,

332
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,584
the Speedway has got a big
problem on its hands right now.

333
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,005
A 40-year-old pipe burst and since
the whole thing's built on landfill,

334
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,798
it's turnin' to mush,
which causin'

335
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,090
all these sinkholes.
Sinkholes.

336
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,760
That's right.
The sinkholes in the infield.

337
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:33,260
Now, they want to fix this thing
up right, so what did they do?

338
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,178
What'd they do,
they called a bunch of us

339
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,657
who used to work
down in them mines.

340
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,891
'Cause we know the work.

341
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,230
And you do good work.

342
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:49,109
We do good work.
But you were just fired.

343
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:53,284
I was let go for liability
reasons involvin' insurance.

344
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,007
Can you just get to the part of
why you think you can do this?

345
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,788
I know how they move the money.

346
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,807
Who's got the code?
They can't get in!

347
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,727
It's Christmas, <i>1225.</i>
That's the override.

348
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:20,974
Hurry.

349
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,398
I got movement!
I got leg! I got leg!

350
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,565
Give him some air!

351
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,841
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

352
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,610
All right. Come on.

353
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,656
Hey, Bobo, what
the hell is all this stuff?

354
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,489
Well, that's PTT.

355
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,162
What them, they gas lines?

356
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,793
Pneumatic Tube Transport.

357
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,666
Each concession has its own rig.

358
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,547
When a register
starts to fill up,

359
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,000
they can do a money
dump through the PTT.

360
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,674
Easy to do, and it don't
interfere with the beer selling.

361
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:58,850
Plus, heck of a lot more secure than
tryin' to pick up cash during a race.

362
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,261
So all them pipes they, what,
they just run right into the...

363
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,686
To the main vault.

364
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,689
The whole thing is
like a cash highway.

365
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,813
<i>I even know the when to do it.</i>

366
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,190
June 4th, the Grocery
Castle Auto Show.

367
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:13,652
It's graduation weekend. It'll be
the smallest turnout of the summer.

368
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,200
And gonna be bare
bones staff and security.

369
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,698
A real bank vault?

370
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:23,041
Yeah, it's a tough one, too.
I looked it up on the Google.

371
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:30,965
<i>The only guy that knows anything</i>

372
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,168
<i>about blowin' up
real bank vaults</i>

373
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,377
<i>is Joe Bang.</i>

374
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,889
<i>Joe Bang, that's</i> a <i>legend
right there. You know where he is.</i>

375
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,179
No, <i>I</i> know <i>where</i> he is.

376
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,395
<i>We can't do it without him.</i>

377
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,895
This is a surprise.

378
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,822
What you say there, Joe Bang?

379
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,901
Ain't seen you in a while.
How goes it?

380
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:02,410
Well, I'm sittin' on this side
of the table wearin' a onesie.

381
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,581
How do you think it's goin'?

382
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,082
Well, you look good.

383
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,923
Real good. Fit.

384
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,588
You two got any quarters?

385
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,889
I got a quarter.

386
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,838
It gotta <i>be...</i> Does
it have to be quarters?

387
00:22:26,868 --> 00:22:27,313
Yeah.

388
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,603
- Come on, now.
- I found one.

389
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:32,685
Yeah, why don't you go over
to the machine on the left,

390
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,486
you punch J-7, bring it back.

391
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:35,609
Go on, now.

392
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:53,456
Doctors. They say
I have high blood pressure.

393
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:57,627
So I get this low
sodium salt, special.

394
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,637
Fake salt.

395
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,804
Can you believe that?

396
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:09,472
Someone thought to do that.
They make fake salt.

397
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,978
So you wanna talk business?

398
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,443
Well, we got a job for you.

399
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,149
A vault.

400
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,950
Look around you, my friends.

401
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,161
My bank-blowin' days are over.

402
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:30,330
Besides...

403
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:35,005
I got a little nest egg,
waitin' for me when I get out.

404
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,006
You're stashing $97,000?

405
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:43,014
Buried under the oak tree with the
red swing, out at your place.

406
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,518
Maybe.

407
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:52,686
Ah, it seems your brother Fish
told his wife about your stash.

408
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,482
Fish told Misty?

409
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:01,065
Yep. Next day,
Misty dug the whole thing up

410
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,490
and ran off with some
truck driver from Florida.

411
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,866
What part of Florida?

412
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,375
Clearwater.

413
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,171
It's a Carven Hill vault,

414
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,544
just like the one you
blew up in Parkersburg.

415
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,217
Steel-encased concrete?

416
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,503
Yeah.
Wall is 20-inch thick.

417
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,054
Alarms?

418
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:28,889
You sneeze within 10 feet
of a Carven Hill vault,

419
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:32,438
its seismic sensors will have you
wearing one of these onesies

420
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:33,856
before you knew what happened.

421
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,143
Well, there's construction goin'
on around there right now,

422
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:40,025
so them seismic
sensors are turned off.

423
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,901
So we just need
you to blow her open.

424
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:48,537
Yeah, I got five
months to go in here.

425
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:53,242
I should probably lay low
a bit before doin' a job.

426
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,748
This has to
happen in five weeks.

427
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:03,423
I am in-car-cer-ra-ted.

428
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,431
Yeah, we got a plan
to get you out.

429
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,945
As in, break me out?

430
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,110
Yep.

431
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,244
In the middle of the night?

432
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:32,619
No.
Afternoon. It's a day job.

433
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:39,956
You're gonna get me
out of here in broad daylight,

434
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:44,969
do the job, and then get me back
in here before anyone notices?

435
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:48,422
Yep.

436
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:57,815
You Logans must be as
simple-minded <i>as</i> people say.

437
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,650
People say that?

438
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:03,983
Who?

439
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,481
So.

440
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,988
What's the take?

441
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,197
It's bigger than you
can bury under an oak tree.

442
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,120
- The split?
- Even split.

443
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:13,618
No. No way.

444
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:16,997
Well, why not?

445
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,788
- I got a brother.
- I got two.

446
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:23,624
I'd need them involved
to protect my interest.

447
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,522
Sadie, why don't you take these over
to your momma and I'll bring the rest.

448
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,608
When are you gonna give
that piece of junk up, huh?

449
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,534
Come on, I keep telling you to
come on down to the dealership

450
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,739
and I'll hook you up.
You know we're family.

451
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,495
We're not family.

452
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,747
You mean I can't interest you
in the latest V-6 offering

453
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:01,704
of the American classic Mustang?

454
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,540
3.7 liters of pure power.

455
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,212
Come on.

456
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:07,967
You can't tell me
you wouldn't love

457
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,545
to get behind
the wheel of this baby.

458
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,801
Come on, jump on in.
Take it fora spin.

459
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,882
I don't need
anything that fancy.

460
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,849
Well, you know, this
Nova ended up costin' Chevy a ton

461
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:20,306
'cause it totally
bit the dust in Mexico.

462
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:23,901
You know, in Mexican,
"Nova" translates to "No Go",

463
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,186
so they couldn't
get anyone to buy it.

464
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:29,740
'Cause they all thought the
car would, you know, "No Go."

465
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,696
You're an idiot.
No, it's true.

466
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,243
Not true.

467
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:34,574
Look it up.

468
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:39,245
Lam kind of surprised you
went for the V-6 automatic.

469
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:43,086
The V-8's just so much faster and you
can really feel the road under you.

470
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,372
'Course, I keep forgettin'
you can't drive stick.

471
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,254
No, I know how to drive stick.

472
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,333
I don't think you do.

473
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,216
All the cars you always bringin'
home from the lot are auto.

474
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,675
I love stick!

475
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,722
I'm a big fan of stick!

476
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,294
Sadie! Come on! Come on!
Yeah! Yeah! Go!

477
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:36,298
Come on, come on, come on!

478
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:40,973
Come on, girl, let's go!

479
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,478
Go, Sadie!

480
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,396
You got a ribbon, baby.
Come here. What's it say?

481
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:50,650
It's not first place.
It only matters if you win.

482
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,198
What?
That ain't true at all.

483
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,321
That boy's damn
near 14-years-old.

484
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:57,824
Come on. Give me a smile. Ah.

485
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,160
Go show your momma.

486
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,160
Way to go, baby doll.

487
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:05,995
- Come to Momma.
- Thanks.

488
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,834
- Aw... Mmm-hmm.
- Hey, you did good.

489
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:08,749
Let me see. Ah...

490
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,750
Let me see. Ah...

491
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,504
Well, I found 'em.

492
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,006
Where?

493
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,346
You should see.

494
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,359
They'll know what
we want them to know.

495
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:37,360
<i>Let's hear it for
the Bang brothers, folks!</i>

496
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,166
- Argh! Damn.
- You all got a sec?

497
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:46,460
Whoa, whoa, I'm winnin'.

498
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:51,548
Okay? Not stoppin'. Don't you
put the Logan hex on me.

499
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,796
Yeah, we been out
to see your brother.

500
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,173
He tell you we were lookin'
to talk to you all?

501
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:59,552
Joe said you need for him
to blow open the vault.

502
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,220
Something like that.

503
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,690
Joe said you know computers.

504
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,733
Yeah, I went to, uh,

505
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,732
technical college.

506
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,735
Well, this here's a little
more involved than that.

507
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,611
We need like a computer whiz.

508
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,534
Like one of them Facebook boys.

509
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,908
I know everything there is to
know about computers. Okay?

510
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:22,988
Do you?

511
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,618
All the Twitters, I know 'em.

512
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:27,201
But me and Sam just ain't
sure we can help y'all.

513
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,582
You can't help us?
Yeah.

514
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,414
We're living with the Lord now.

515
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:36,426
Which means on
the light side of the raw.

516
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,932
If you two ain't into this, then why the
hell did Joe tell us to come out here then?

517
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:46,846
Gotta have a good reason to break the law.
Do somethin' like robbin'.

518
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,431
Mmm.
Yeah, we need a moral reason.

519
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,522
We'd be robbin'
the Grocery Castle Auto.

520
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,570
You can't tell me you ain't
shoplifted from the Grocery Castle.

521
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:59,116
Oh, yeah. We used to shoplift
from them all the time,

522
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,779
but that was before.

523
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,954
Well, our sister Mellie,

524
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:08,243
she used to work up at the
Grocery Castle outside Manila.

525
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:11,913
And they promoted her
to checker after a month.

526
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,964
Then, the assistant manager

527
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,425
- started getting handsy.
- Handsy.

528
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,878
Oh.
So you can imagine

529
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,964
our family don't have no love
for the Grocery Castle.

530
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,257
I can understand the feelings.

531
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:27,970
Yeah, this being their big event
and all, there at the auto show,

532
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:29,335
we don't feel too bad about it.

533
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,643
Nope.

534
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,308
Come here.

535
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,564
What you think?
Yeah.

536
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:36,645
Okay.

537
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:40,991
Sounds good enough for us.

538
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,823
'Cause of
the whole morality thing.

539
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:05,342
I need you two to go visit
the bear in the woods.

540
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:08,720
<i>Tell him you're
there to collect the bag</i>

541
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,846
<i>he's been keeping for me.</i>

542
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,872
Cauliflower.

543
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,727
<i>Vehicular mischief.</i>

544
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:58,519
<i>Reckless endangerment,
destruction of private property.</i>

545
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:00,487
<i>I'd take your
license away, Clyde,</i>

546
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:03,031
<i>but it was
suspended two years ago.</i>

547
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:06,117
<i>And despite your claim that this was
an accident, that your foot slipped,</i>

548
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:08,366
<i>these are serious charges.</i>

549
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:13,033
Your previous run-ins
with the law were back

550
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,868
when you were
classified <i>as</i> a juvenile

551
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,920
and, of course, in determining
your sentencing...

552
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,500
I'm taking into
account your service

553
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:24,427
and the great sacrifice
you've made for our country.

554
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:28,265
I sentence you to 90 days.

555
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,152
You sure these
measurements is right?

556
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:31,495
Mellie gave 'em to me.
And Mellie knows her trucks.

557
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,389
<i>Sadie's to-do list.
Make sure you get it all done.</i>

558
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,538
All right.

559
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:38,951
Come on.

560
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,416
Hoo-ah!
Careful!

561
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,840
"Tanning salon"?

562
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:51,006
<i>Yeah,
well, we'll see about that.</i>

563
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,966
Now, it has to be dependable.

564
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,347
I can't have no
chance of it breaking down.

565
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:58,430
You want a camper coverin' the
bed of the truck? Or just empty?

566
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,514
Yeah, a cover's a good idea.

567
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,600
'Cause them campers
can get kinda creepy.

568
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:05,187
I think them cops more likely to give
them camper trucks a second look.

569
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,114
All right, Sadie-bug,
get them goggles down.

570
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:11,193
I don't want to get none of this in
your peepers. You sure about this?

571
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,028
I'm ready.

572
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,872
All right. Close your eyes.

573
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:28,676
You littered all over my car,
with your shoes.

574
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,299
Well, I'm sorry.

575
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,554
Ah! Wait, get your hand off.
Ah.

576
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,480
Hi. Hi! Aw...

577
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,557
You excited?
Yes.

578
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,564
Extensions!

579
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,899
I got real long this time.
Yeah!

580
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,230
I thought you were
goin' as Rihanna.

581
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,032
Daddy, it's not Halloween.

582
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,734
I'm not goin' as Rihanna.

583
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,571
I'm singing a song
of hers for my talent.

584
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:59,708
I still got two other categories to
compete in, Denim Wear and Glitz.

585
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:02,252
For Glitz, I need this hair.

586
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:03,712
All right.

587
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,253
Mmm.

588
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,090
That looks like it hurt.

589
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:16,216
What?

590
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:19,265
It did.

591
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,931
It's healing up now
pretty good, though.

592
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,939
Looks like you coulda used
a couple of stitches.

593
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,565
Mmm-hmm.

594
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,605
A little late for that, I guess.
Mmm.

595
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:35,239
Well, when was the last time
you had a tetanus shot?

596
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,957
Um... Never?

597
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,583
That the wrong answer?

598
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:49,462
There are no wrong answers when you're
talkin' to a healthcare professional.

599
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,301
Would you like one?

600
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:54,137
What is all this,
like a charity or something?

601
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,922
Jimmy Logan,
you know <i>as</i> well as I do

602
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,973
folks around here don't
like the word charity.

603
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:00,636
We West Virginians
are a proud folk.

604
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,974
We have a couple of grants, but

605
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,559
mostly get by on
private donations.

606
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,315
People happy we do our work.

607
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,067
Driving from town to town,
trying to help

608
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:14,320
locals who can't
make it to the doctor.

609
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,611
What happened
to three-two-one?

610
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,995
So you know me?
We met before?

611
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,836
I went to Valley View.
A couple years behind you.

612
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,712
Hmm.

613
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,254
Back then you were all

614
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:36,008
Jimmy Logan, quarterback,
Homecoming King.

615
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:39,428
Only had eyes for Bobbie
Jo Campbell, if I recall.

616
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,009
Hold that there.

617
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,354
I think you'll like this one.

618
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,519
There we go. I got that.

619
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:56,483
So, Sylvia?

620
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,698
Ain't no one ever
called you Sylvie?

621
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:03,365
No one has ever
called me Sylvie.

622
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,709
That's weird.

623
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,336
MY name?

624
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,465
Well, you know, it's just...

625
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,542
It's kind of like
an old lady name.

626
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,503
To me.

627
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,054
It just don't seem like it
should be on a person like you.

628
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,602
That looks like you.
That's, you know...

629
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,896
My grand momma,
her name was Sylvia.

630
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:32,228
So that's just what I think of
when I think of that name.

631
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:41,654
Oh! I thought
you was getting coffee.

632
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,784
Didn't know we was
seeing patients yet.

633
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,286
Uh, I got a coffee
and a patient.

634
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:47,868
But we better hit the road.

635
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:54,750
Sounds like that alternator
needs a tetanus shot.

636
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,051
Alternators cost money.

637
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,753
Tetanus shots are free.

638
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:02,223
There's a garage over off
Bluefield Canyon Road.

639
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:06,098
Ask for Earl. Might not be free,
but he'll treat you fine.

640
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,770
Thanks.
All right.

641
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,896
Hey, hey, hey, hold on
a second. Hold on. Hold on.

642
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:17,730
Did we kiss?

643
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:21,159
I mean, in high school,
we kissed, didn't we?

644
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:26,619
That has got to be the worst thing
anyone has ever said to me.

645
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:29,952
Hold on, hold on, wait, wait!
I'm saying I remember is all!

646
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:34,464
I do.

647
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:36,629
I do remember.

648
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:45,141
I see there's still
a lot of your rules up there.

649
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,640
So?

650
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,481
Just, have you thought about

651
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:56,152
"having a backup plan",

652
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:00,573
or what we're gonna do the
first time "shit happens"?

653
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,491
Let alone the second time.

654
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:09,078
Why don't you just worry
about your cockroaches?

655
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:10,830
And I'll worry about the rules.

656
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:13,670
Okay.

657
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,729
Jimmy?
Hey, what you say, Cal?

658
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,060
Hey, how you been?

659
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:17,021
What's going on, man?
Oh, you know, staying busy.

660
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,819
Oh, good, good, good. Hey, did you
find work? Yeah, a few things.

661
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,521
Oh, great. These parts
or back in Boone County?

662
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,151
No, back home.
Oh, good. Good, good.

663
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:24,733
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

664
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,659
You know, I felt bad and all
about having to let you go.

665
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,111
Oh, come on, man.
Don't even worry about it.

666
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,411
- I know it was them, not you.
- Well...

667
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:30,697
Even if things
had been different,

668
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,704
I probably would a had to let you go
anyways, since we're wrapping it up.

669
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:38,626
What? You're all wrapping up
the site? You all done?

670
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:40,048
Yeah, just about. Yeah.

671
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:42,592
Managed to be
ahead of schedule for once.

672
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:44,419
Oh.

673
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,421
You patched up
all them sinkholes?

674
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:49,273
Yeah, almost, yeah. We're gonna
pull the gear first of the month.

675
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,759
<i>You know that thing
we been talkin' about?</i>

676
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,762
<i>We got to move it up a week.</i>

677
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,054
What happened?

678
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,106
<i>Opportunity is
gonna be closing up.</i>

679
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:00,564
<i>So everything stays the same, we just
gotta move everything up by one week.</i>

680
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:06,612
Wait, one week earlier?
But that's...

681
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:07,900
<i>I</i> know.

682
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,287
I guess
this is "shit happens."

683
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:12,784
Yep.

684
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,119
So should we cancel?

685
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,125
No difference.

686
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:21,085
The Coca-Cola 600 is the biggest race
of the year. That's a big difference.

687
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:23,462
That don't
change the job at all.

688
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,796
So should I call The Baker?

689
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:31,933
Call The Baker.

690
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,308
This is Gleema.

691
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:45,897
Gleema Purdue?

692
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,072
Yes.

693
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:48,650
Need you to sign
right here, please.

694
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:54,243
Right there, please.

695
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:01,003
Who's it from?

696
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:05,167
No idea, ma'am. No card, no name on
the paperwork. We just deliver 'em.

697
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:08,837
He just said, "I guess someone
thinks it's your birthday."

698
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:12,132
I mean, I have no idea.

699
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:14,217
I've never seen
a more beautiful cake.

700
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:16,807
Well, maybe somebody's
got a crush.

701
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,138
Oh, well...

702
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:20,519
I have no idea who it could be.

703
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,439
After that last experience
on Plenty O Fish,

704
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,896
I have stayed away
from the online dating.

705
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:29,740
Gleema. You better
come out front again.

706
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:31,906
What? More for me?

707
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:33,194
Not exactly.

708
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,321
Someone hit and ran you, ma'am.

709
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,202
We'll check the cameras.

710
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:40,581
In the meantime, we're going to
need to fill out some paperwork.

711
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:41,918
<i>Oh!</i>

712
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:44,752
My car.

713
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:46,878
Oh.

714
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,709
Tsk.

715
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,548
Oh, man!

716
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,307
Ma'am, I'm sorry about your car,

717
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,270
but I really need you
to start filling this out.

718
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:10,940
Is it 5:30?

719
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:14,031
Ain't no arguin' with that
automatic door. Are you okay?

720
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:16,784
I didn't get to finish my cake.

721
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:35,636
<i>Howdy Goody.</i>

722

Hey, y'all.

723
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:33,864
I'm just gonna
squeeze myself in there.

724
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,364
So, Naaman,

725
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:42,532
I got a little
proposition for you.

726
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,572
One... One...
One... One.

727
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,495
Three...
Three.

728
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,742
Eight.
Eight.

729
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:30,497
Shit, man, what's up?

730
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:36,427
Hey, Jimmy.

731
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:39,760
<i>No names. You calling

<i>A secure location.</i>

<i>You calling from

736
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:52,106
I'm calling on a phone.
Like a real phone.

737
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:53,602
Go ahead.

738
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,896
We have a code pink.
I repeat,

739
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:57,948
<i>we have a code pink.</i>

Goddamn it.

Hey, hey. You didn't
have to scare us like that.

748

We thought you was the law.

749
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:27,423
Oh, when did you have
a chance to think that?

750
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:29,262
Seeing as you were
dead asleep a second ago!

751
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:30,809
You were supposed to meet me
down at the corner!

752
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:31,886
Now we're running way behind!

753
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,312
We got it.

You got it?
You still seem half-asleep.

We're on it, okay?

756
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:39,443
We know where to be and when.
"Watch the race."

757
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:42,230
That's right! The clock
on the race. Remember!

758
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:43,781
Yeah, we know.

759
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:51,539

- Yes, sweetie.

It's a nice car.

00:49:57,244 --> 00:50:00,123
Hopefully you'll have beginner's
luck getting it into first.

00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:01,666
Even in first gear,

No, sir, we took care of that.

773
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,497
Good. 'Cause we
don't have a food problem

00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:41,005
You're choking.
Someone know the Heindrick?

777
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,632
Sounds like a wet cough,
like phlegm.

778

I don't feel too good.

Where are you going? I thought
you'd be with me the whole time.

783
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:08,320
I just need to go to the salon

784
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:12,529
I'll be back just in time to comb
you out and spray you extra good.

785
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,663
Promise?
I promise.

786
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:20,999
<i>This will help rehydrate
you, ease the nausea.</i>

787
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:23,547
<i>A lot of you guys
coming in here like that.</i>

788
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,336
It's that
business with the water.

789
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,714
Say you can't drink it but
it's okay to shower in it.

790
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:30,011
I don't know
about all that. Hmm.

791
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,548
More barf than we saw
after that one Thanksgiving

792
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:34,175
when everything had gone bad.

793
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:36,886
It'll put a girl
off of turkey forever.

794
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:15,595
<i>Nurse?</i>

795
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:17,768
<i>Miss? Miss?</i>

796
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:19,728
Miss? Urn...

797
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:20,804
Yeah?

798
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:23,437
All these fluids?

799
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:28,446
I'm sorry, nurse, but is it
possible for me to use the commode?

800
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:30,857
Mmm, I think it's
best if you stay put.

801
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:32,532
Don't want you getting
light-headed and all.

802
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:36,454
Oh, please, ma'am,
don't make me use that thing.

803
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:39,874
A second ago I was a miss,
and now I'm a ma'am. Hmm.

804
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:43,623
Please'? Miss Nurse?
I'll walk slow.

805
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:46,705
Nurse? I can take him.

806
00:52:46,789 --> 00:52:48,962
I'm finished mopping
the floors in here.

807
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:52,799
Okay. But take it slow.

808
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:55,097
He falls and hits his head,
that's on you.

809
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:56,640
Yes, ma'am.

810
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:02,642
Yeah, I'm gonna
need a hand in here.

811
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:00,881
What the fuck?

812
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:03,767
What, you never wondered
what it's like to feel white?

813
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:21,284
Move aside! Out of my way!

814
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:30,294
This is Warden Burns.
Lam declaring a code red.

815
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,126
This is not a test.

816
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:34,961
All guards

817
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:38,970
<i>and staff are to go into an
immediate code fourteen lockdown.</i>

818
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:41,426
<i>I repeat, this is not a drill.</i>

819
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:47,428
What are you doing?

820
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:48,975
Calling it in.

821
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:51,106
This could turn into a riot.

822
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,483
Put that down.

823
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:55,819
Hang it UP-

824
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,110
We don't have riots at Monroe.

825
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:06,618
<i>"Pour one intotwo."
Okay.</i>

826
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:09,617
"Pour two into three."
Yep.

827
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:12,995
"Pour three into four."

828
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:14,997
Okay.

829
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:18,842
"And run."

830
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:20,673
What?

831
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:22,678
Run!

832
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:35,525
What the hell?

833
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:37,194
Are you down, too?
Yeah.

834
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,104
They're all down.
Here on the mezzanine,

835
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:40,860
we got no
plastic working at all.

836
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:30,914
Mellie, what did you do?

837
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:33,542
Well, hello.

838
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:36,582
I guess someone grew up.

839
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:39,919
What's your name again,
little Logan?

840
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:41,420
Mellie.
Mellie!

841
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,923
Mellie, Mellie, Mellie.

842
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,094
That rhymes with "smelly."

843
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,766
Nice.

844
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:51,093
Shut up.

845
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:53,058
There's clothes
for you both in the bag

846
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,889
and, Clyde, I put something
special in there for you.

847
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,775
Thanks, Mel.

848
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,278
You're going pretty fast.

849
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,527
Well, we got a lot
of road to cover so, yeah,

850
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:05,949
there will be speeding.

851
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,823
Gunning for 100
in a neon blue car

852
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,121
that probably ain't
even on the market yet.

853
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:15,410
Don't you think you're asking
for to be pulled over?

854
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,290
Sunday on a holiday weekend.

855
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:19,004
Police department
hit by budget cuts.

856
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:22,424
There's only one musker patrolling the
whole highway for the next 40 miles.

857
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:24,631
But that's still one musker.

858
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,465
It's been handled.

859
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:27,967
Mellie,

860
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:33,469
I'm about to get naked
back here. So no peeking.

861
00:58:36,138 --> 00:58:38,140
I said no peeking!

862
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:40,980
Would you give
me my arm, please?

863
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,146
Is it this one?

864
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:49,155
<i>Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, I'm 100% sure</i>

865
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:54,331
I saw what I saw. It's a
purple '77 Eldorado. Yes, sir.

866
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,661
License and registration, ma'am.

867
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,751
Excuse me,
but I'm on my way to church.

868
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:03,252
I don't have time for this.

869
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:04,531
Step out of the vehicle, ma'am.

870
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:05,863
I am not going to ask you again.

871
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:08,470
This is ridiculous!
What did I do?

872
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:09,967
I need you to comply, ma'am.

873
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,688
I need your license,
your registration...

874
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:13,008
You seen that?

875
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,973
Seen what?
I need you to focus here.

876
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,310
This woman needs containing.

877
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:19,497
<i>It's</i> a <i>beautiful day
for racing in the</i> Queen <i>City.</i>

878
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:22,688
<i>Welcome to the
Coca-Cola 600.</i>

879
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,070
<i>This is NASCAR's
greatest distance</i>

880
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:27,489
<i>and stock car
racing's longest night.</i>

881
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:31,034
<i>It'll take 400 laps
to complete 600 miles.</i>

882
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:32,277
<i>And Mike, you know,</i>

883
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,828
<i>one of the stories
we're all gonna be watching is</i>

884
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:36,748
<i>this guy Dayton White, as he returns
to racing after a two-year break.</i>

885
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:39,831
<i>And Jeff, you certainly know what it's
like to get back behind the wheel!</i>

886
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:41,127
After some time off.

887
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:43,046
Can we really expect
this guy to run up front?

888
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:44,923
Well, that truly is
the question, D.W.

889
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,841
And, yeah,
it is extremely tough.

890
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:49,841
So much has changed since the
last time he was in the car.

891
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:50,962
The cars have changed.

892
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:53,174
The setups have changed,
the competition's changed.

893
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:54,928
And you know,
you just can't underestimate

894
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,931
the mental focus
and endurance needed

895
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,513
to get back behind the wheel
after this long of a break.

896
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:02,144
Well, focus,
endurance and discipline

897
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:04,852
could well describe
Dayton's off-track routine.

898
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,482
We caught up with
him as he prepared

899
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:09,531
for this highly
anticipated return to racing.

900
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:13,531
<i>There's a team of
people looking after my car.</i>

901
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,363
<i>Making sure everything
is operating at full capacity.</i>

902
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,704
<i>So it makes sense that I do
that for my physical self.</i>

903
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:22,878
<i>Because I'm not just a driver,
I'm an athlete.</i>

904
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:27,834
<i>Once I began sourcing
really clean software,</i>

905
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:32,046
<i>I noticed a total difference
in my clarity and performance.</i>

906
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,430
<i>Software's what I call my food.</i>

907
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:36,808
<i>Because,
when you think about it,</i>

908
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:39,762
<i>your body is your
operating system.</i>

909
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:43,061
<i>So when your OS may
feel like it's working fine,</i>

910
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:46,019
<i>a problem with software can make
your computer not perform properly.</i>

911
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:48,354
<i>Even</i> crash.

912
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:51,781
<i>So eating only clean software,
making sure my</i> OS

913
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:55,615
<i>is working at an optimum level
and all this will help me win.</i>

914
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:07,630
Speed up the drops. We'll
figure the numbers out later.

915
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,774
No energy drink on the market
comes in a magnum, right?

916
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:32,940
But I had 10 cases of these
babies made just for today.

917
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:35,947
I'll have a little now, before
the race, some during the race,

918
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:38,199
and come lap 600
and that checkered flag,

919
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:41,990
I think we're all gonna be finishing
these puppies off in victory. Huh?

920
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:44,834
You got us all in the shot?
Me and the car?

921
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,254
So I've got this racing suit and
I've got my helmet right here,

922
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:49,377
just want to make sure
you can see that. Huh?

923
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:53,843
I've been carefully monitoring
my glucose levels.

924
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:57,472
So I'm really in a sweet spot
right now for sustained energy.

925
01:01:58,089 --> 01:02:02,014
You're the To The Max driver.
You got to drink.

926
01:02:03,178 --> 01:02:05,556
Maybe you should think about
those four years of back taxes

927
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:07,516
that this drink
is paying for, huh?

928
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:11,357
Yeah, go on!

929
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,528
- Go on!
- Come on.

930
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:14,444
Let's...
Drink <i>m.</i>

931
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:15,865
- Come on.
- Come on!

932
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:18,197
Drink, drink, drink!

933
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:19,918
Ready, boy? Beware!

934
01:02:19,945 --> 01:02:21,447
Yeah!

935
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:30,038
Okay. I'm gonna need some cash.

936
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:31,373
What for?

937
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:33,838
Supplies. For the job.

938
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:35,544
I thought Jimmy
and your brothers

939
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:37,387
were bringing
everything you needed.

940
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:40,345
Yeah, no, they did, I just
need a little contingency.

941
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:43,268
Well, it looks like
my brothers was successful.

942
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:44,344
You thirsty?

943
01:02:46,221 --> 01:02:47,723
No. No way.

944
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:50,400
Just one. Come on.
No. No.

945
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,727
We got time. Come on.

946
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,863
Hey, gorgeous. Give me one
of those beers, will you?

947
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:58,192
You want a second
one for just $10 more?

948
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,902
Well, of course I do.

949
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:03,655
And, baby doll,
give me two packs

950
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:05,411
of those gummy bears.

951
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:06,979
This <i>is</i> the Warden.

952
01:03:07,242 --> 01:03:08,539
<i>All right?</i>

953
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:10,750
Now I got your

954
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:14,253
napkin of demands here
of what you want for

955
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:17,628
<i>peaceful surrender
and the safe release</i>

956
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:19,759
<i>of my guards
you're holding captive.</i>

957
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:24,935
<i>As warden, I can, uh,
approve buying a copy of</i>

958
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:27,228
A <i>Dance With</i> Dragons
<i>for the prison library,</i>

959
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:29,518
<i>to go up on
the Game of Thrones shelf.</i>

960
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:33,272
<i>Now, the
only problem is that, uh,</i>

961
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:37,147
<i>The</i> Winds <i>of</i> Winter <i>and A</i> Dream of
Spring <i>have yet to be published,</i>

962
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:38,903
<i>so those aren't available.</i>

963
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:43,779
<i>Well, I can't do anything
about what I can't control.</i>

964
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,953
That is total bullshit!

965
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:55,632
George R.R. Martin was supposed
to deliver The <i>Winds</i> of Winter

966
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,917
to his publisher
over two years ago.

967
01:03:58,126 --> 01:04:00,166
<i>I know that was
the original deadline.</i>

968
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,672
<i>That's what it says here.</i>

969
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:03,757
<i>But Pm reading to you
from the Wikipedia page.</i>

970
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:06,639
<i>It also says that Martin</i>

971
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:10,814
<i>had a grueling promotion schedule
or something, and it's interfered</i>

972
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:15,485
<i>with his writing schedule. He's failed
to complete The Winds of Winter.</i>

973
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:19,147
That don't make no sense.

974
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:22,325
Those two guys who transferred
in from Federal last month

975
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:25,783
knew about all the new stuff with
the hot chick and her dragons.

976
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,079
<i>No.
I'm telling you,</i>

977
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:29,249
<i>I believe those two inmates
had that information</i>

978
01:04:29,324 --> 01:04:30,667

979
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:34,496
<i>Again, I'm reading to you.

980
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:37,166

981
01:04:37,332 --> 01:04:40,336

<i>The pace car is in

<i>Let's go racing for those</i>

1002

<i>who made
the ultimate sacrifice, boys.</i>

1003
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:14,267
D.W.'s talking about you.

1004
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:20,352
What, Jimmy leave us
some sort of door key

1005
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:21,607
for us to meet up?

1006
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:25,240
Something like that.
Just remember one thing.

1007
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:28,447
Roll. Don't hesitate, just roll.

1008
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:30,949
What are you talking about?

1009
01:06:31,613 --> 01:06:33,615
What's down there?

1010
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:34,954
Remember to roll.

1011
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:36,914
What the fuck?

1012
01:06:39,621 --> 01:06:41,294
Oh, come on.

1013
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:43,963
Roll, roll!

1014
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:51,299
Now you didn't tell me
about no garbage chute!

1015
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:52,976
You're right.

1016
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:20,291
Hey, hey.
It's about time. Come on.

1017
01:07:20,495 --> 01:07:21,712
Yeah, blow me.

1018
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:23,540
Aw, come on, Joe, we
couldn't tell you everything now.

1019
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:24,624
Yeah, no, no, no.

1020
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:27,677
Screw you both!
A garbage chute?

1021
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:29,884
This is what I get
for doing business

1022
01:07:29,963 --> 01:07:32,341
with a couple of unlucky Logans.

1023
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:36,352
Them's my bleach pens?

1024
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:39,685
Two bleach pens and a
plastic bag, as requested.

1025
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:17,393
Give me the tube.

1026
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:18,557
Hold on. That's it?

1027
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:20,646
We're supposed to believe
that that's the thing?

1028
01:08:20,722 --> 01:08:21,894
Tube.

1029
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:25,898
Now, are you ready?

1030
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,654
No. No, hold on. That's it?

1031
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:30,573
That's a plastic bag,
bleach pens,

1032
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:33,242
fake salt and gummy bears.
That's our bomb?

1033
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:35,870
Don't call it a bomb.

1034
01:08:36,237 --> 01:08:39,081
Now, how many yards
away is the vault?

1035
01:08:39,574 --> 01:08:42,418
About 20 yards.
I don't know, maybe 30.

1036
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:45,088
Is it 20 or is it 30?

1037
01:08:45,413 --> 01:08:48,087
We are dealing
with science here.

1038
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:49,918
I guess when I saw
that gummy bears

1039
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:51,761
is our secret
ingredient to our Bo...

1040
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:54,013
Our explosive device,

1041
01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:55,715
that I wasn't
thinking about science!

1042
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:58,267
Now, you said yourself
we couldn't bring in

1043
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:00,261
normal explosives
'cause of the security!

1044
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:04,273
Now, to make our bang,
we need potassium chlorate.

1045
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:06,730
Bleach pens is
pure sodium hypochlorite.

1046
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:11,030
Combined with the potassium
chloride in the salt substitute,

1047
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:14,613
we have created
an equal exchange of ions.

1048
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:18,446
Sugar, plus potassium chlorate

1049
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,123
yields...

1050
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:28,794
<i>two gasses and</i>

1051
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:32,135
a solid.

1052
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:35,634
Now, you throw in some heat,
you get energy.

1053
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:38,887
Energy means light, explosion,

1054
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:41,469
or, as I like to call it...

1055
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:44,806
the Joe Bang.

1056
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,649
What? You thought
I was going to use

1057
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:52,488
a stick of dynamite
or something?

1058
01:09:55,817 --> 01:09:58,570
Well, yeah, I kinda did.

1059
01:09:58,653 --> 01:10:00,701
Yeah, me, too.
I just figured you'd use

1060
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:03,329
a lot to blow through
the thick steel walls.

1061
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:06,290
We don't need to
blow through the wall.

1062
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:09,838
Them tubes in the
venting system is our in.

1063
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:12,838
So, gentlemen, as I said...

1064
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:16,338
are you ready?

1065
01:10:39,444 --> 01:10:40,445
Oh, shit.

1066
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:10,368
- It's coming back!
- Get down!

1067
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:19,233
Don't move.
I'm not.

1068
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:20,910
And don't breathe.

1069
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:22,237
I'm not.

1070
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:37,422
What are you
doing? Wait...

1071
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:46,269
Oh. Now I see
what the problem is.

1072
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:48,934
I twisted
the bag too many times.

1073
01:12:12,954 --> 01:12:13,000
<i>Keselowski on the outside</i>

1074
01:12:13,001 --> 01:12:14,463
<i>Keselowski on the outside</i>

1075
01:12:14,539 --> 01:12:16,462
<i>and see who else is behind him.</i>

1076
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:18,259
<i>He's not gonna
give it up that easy.</i>

1077
01:12:18,376 --> 01:12:19,969
<i>You can see he's pretty loose.</i>

1078
01:12:36,978 --> 01:12:38,321
Call it in.

1079
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:46,116
E Center.

1080
01:12:49,824 --> 01:12:51,622
Well, what kind of smoke?

1081
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:58,003
Everything looks fine here.
We've got no alarms going off.

1082
01:12:58,291 --> 01:12:59,668
What's going on?

1083
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:03,258
Concessions says they have smoke
coming out of the PT tube.

1084
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:05,715
If there's no fire,
why do we have smoke?

1085
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:08,142
Let's get a couple of guys down there
and see what the hell's going on.

1086
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:09,264
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1087
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:45,755
I'll go east, you go west.
Okay.

1088
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:57,107
Hey. Hey, it's coming
through! I can hear it!

1089
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:09,279
All right, come on.

1090
01:14:09,737 --> 01:14:10,937
- Come on!
- There it is, baby!

1091
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:13,915
Come on!

1092
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:15,125
Woo-hoo!

1093
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:16,706
Come on, baby!

1094
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:19,246
Maybe we can
leave out of here yet!

1095
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:22,800
Come on, Jimmy! Kick that
up a notch! Come on!

1096
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:26,341
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey.

1097
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:31,267
Get it in reverse!

1098
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:33,142
Take it easy!
We ain't out of here yet!

1099
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:46,782
Oh, God.

1100
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:49,284
What? What happened?

1101
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:53,118
You sucked my arm off!

1102
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:55,040
This is your fault, not mine.

1103
01:14:55,116 --> 01:14:56,413
You told me to turn it up!

1104
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:57,914
You don't even know how to
operate a goddamn machine!

1105
01:14:57,994 --> 01:14:59,621
You said put it in
reverse! I put it in reverse.

1106
01:14:59,704 --> 01:15:00,830
You sucked his arm off!

1107
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:02,711
Your fault. Your fault.

1108
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:04,133
Hold on. It's in there?
It's all the way in there?

1109
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:05,547
It's not stuck in
the tube or nothing?

1110
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:07,970
No. I got to
get in there and get it.

1111
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:11,224
Jimmy, help me get the hose off.
I'm gonna go get it myself.

1112
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,342
Come on, then Technically,
it's not your arm.

1113
01:15:13,801 --> 01:15:16,145
Your arm you lost over in Iraq.

1114
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,894
That thing in there's
just a piece of plastic.

1115
01:15:18,973 --> 01:15:21,601
Your arm can't be replaced
is what I'm trying to...

1116
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:25,029
Your arm can't be replaced,
but that piece of plastic

1117
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:27,198
that you use as an arm,
that can be replaced.

1118
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:29,196
Clyde, Clyde, come on. Clyde!

1119
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:34,455
Now, there's a lot more money
we can get out of there.

1120
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:38,000
We got to finish this.
Come on.

1121
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:42,000
You're with them?

1122
01:15:42,455 --> 01:15:45,208
Of course he's with us.
The whole thing was his idea.

1123
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:46,338
Yeah.

1124
01:15:46,417 --> 01:15:48,297
Except he probably
don't wanna say that out loud

1125
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:51,885
'cause he knows you getting your arm
blowed off in Iraq was all his fault.

1126
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:54,308
Everybody knows
you never would have gone

1127
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:57,933
and joined up to fight if your big
brother wasn't the football star.

1128
01:15:58,012 --> 01:15:59,184
- Well, that's true.
- Yeah.

1129
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:03,313
He was gonna be hot shit.
He was gonna play for the NFL.

1130
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:06,612
And nobody around here
ever done anything like that.

1131
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:10,032
You were gonna be just another
white trash coal miner.

1132
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:12,109
The Logan Family Curse.

1133
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:15,288
Shut up! You two are idiots.

1134
01:16:15,362 --> 01:16:19,037
Hey. We're value
added to this robbery.

1135
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:22,245
And if anyone has a right to be
pulling an attitude here, it's us.

1136
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:23,375
Yeah.

1137
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:25,094
Oh, the Bang brothers
don't like the job'?

1138
01:16:25,122 --> 01:16:26,322
Hmm?
You got a problem with it?

1139
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:29,843
Yeah. You changed the date,
moved everything around.

1140
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:32,263
This whole job
changed dramastically.

1141
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:33,931
We had to change the date!

1142
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:35,223
You knew the terms

1143
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:36,425
for our participating.
Mmm-hmm.

1144
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:39,729
We needed a moral reason
to pull this job with you.

1145
01:16:39,804 --> 01:16:42,432
Now, we was fine with you wanting
to get back at that store

1146
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:44,483
for messing
with your hot sister.

1147
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:48,654
But you did a whole 360 on everything
when you moved up the date!

1148
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:50,572
And NASCAR
ain't done nothing to nobody.

1149
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:53,238
NASCAR is a beautiful thing.
NASCAR's like America.

1150
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:55,786
It's like you're
making us hurt America.

1151
01:16:55,861 --> 01:17:00,458
So moving up that date was a vagrant
fliolation of our morality clause.

1152
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:02,376
I'll show you "vagrant"...

1153
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:05,583
It's all good, it's all good.

1154
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:07,877
Shut the...

1155
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:12,419
We need to finish this.

1156
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:15,052
Now, you go talk to
your brother, all right?

1157
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:22,229
Hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Hold on, man.

1158
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:25,145
Hey, I'm your brother.

1159
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:26,897
All right?

1160
01:17:27,268 --> 01:17:28,861
I'm always with you.

1161
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:30,817
I'll buy you 20 new arms.

1162
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:33,399
A hundred,
as soon as we're done.

1163
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:36,076
But we got to get you back
before anybody notices.

1164
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:38,783
All right?
So let's finish this.

1165
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:40,738
Okay?

1166
01:17:40,781 --> 01:17:44,001
They'll find it and the guards will
be banging on my cell by breakfast.

1167
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:46,329
No, they ain't.
'Cause I'm gonna get it.

1168
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:49,586
I'm gonna get it,
I promise you. I swear.

1169
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:53,761
Am I clear?

1170
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:56,259
<i>Don't let these
clowns get in your head.</i>

1171
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:59,470
<i>We all know you
want to finish first,</i>

1172
01:17:59,592 --> 01:18:01,185
<i>but first you got to finish.</i>

1173
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:03,354
<i>I'm getting a lot of dirty air.</i>

1174
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:05,682
<i>I got a hole,
I can push through.</i>

1175
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:22,115
<i>Hold back. It's too tight.
You're getting boxed.</i>

1176
01:18:25,993 --> 01:18:27,586
Whoa, I'm seeing spots.

1177
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:29,004
<i>You're drifting up.</i>

1178
01:18:29,163 --> 01:18:31,461
My OS...
I think it's crashing.

1179
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:33,029
<i>You're gonna bang in!</i>

1180
01:18:49,016 --> 01:18:50,108
What have you got?

1181
01:18:50,184 --> 01:18:51,276
I got nothing.

1182
01:18:51,352 --> 01:18:53,150
Let's try B level.
All right.

1183
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:26,683
Hold up! Stop!
Where are you going?

1184
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:29,439
Garbage run.

1185
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:32,018
You two smell any
smoke from down there?

1186
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:36,189
Uh, no, 'cause we both...

1187
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:39,151
We both lost our sense
of smells when we was little.

1188
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:40,280
'Cause of the, uh...

1189
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:41,781
The scarlet fever.
Yeah.

1190
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:44,989
Both of us could be on fire
and not even know it.

1191
01:19:45,072 --> 01:19:47,450
Get that thing out of here.
Okay, thank you very much.

1192
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:50,540
Okay. All right.

1193
01:19:55,582 --> 01:19:57,084
Something ain't right.

1194
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:29,749
Whoa, whoa.

1195
01:20:30,617 --> 01:20:31,834
What's that?

1196
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:48,347
Hey! Your brothers
should be back by now!

1197
01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:50,145
Why don't you go check on 'em?

1198
01:20:57,686 --> 01:21:00,280
You know there's
no smoking on CMS property.

1199
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:02,233
Oh, that's right.

1200
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:05,490
That's probably why they
put an ashtray in here.

1201
01:21:09,615 --> 01:21:12,368
You still gotta put
that out and get back to work.

1202
01:21:12,451 --> 01:21:14,749
Man, it's a three-quarter-mile
walk to get outside.

1203
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:18,128
I said
break time's over, Smokey.

1204
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:24,221
You know, they call
'em 20 for a reason.

1205
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:27,300
And I got four minutes
to go on my 20.

1206
01:21:28,175 --> 01:21:29,893
Are you pushing "Open"?

1207
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:31,470
It doesn't say "Open", okay?

1208
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:33,597
It says "Start,"
but it won't open.

1209
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:34,897
Well, stop it.

1210
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:36,350
What?
Stop it!

1211
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:40,442
I thought we wanted it to start.

1212
01:21:40,521 --> 01:21:43,149
We do, but it needs to stop.

1213
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:44,779
So not start?

1214
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:49,614
We need it to start, but we have
to stop it so I can figure out

1215
01:21:49,696 --> 01:21:51,869
why it won't open.

1216
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:06,175
Oh, shit.

1217
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:07,680
Hey, hey, hey.

1218
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:13,308
Do you smell any smoke?

1219
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:15,685
Smoke? No.

1220
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:18,859
All I smell is
them racing fumes.

1221
01:22:20,519 --> 01:22:22,192
All right, thanks. Go ahead.

1222
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:27,697
Shit.

1223
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:31,355
- Okay, get...
- Three, two...

1224
01:22:31,405 --> 01:22:32,645
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

1225
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:34,746
Are we going on "one"
or are we going on "go"?

1226
01:22:34,992 --> 01:22:36,118
Uh, three.

1227
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:38,420
No, we're going on "go"!
Three, two...

1228
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:41,339
Hold on! Hold on! You're
gonna rip it right off the track!

1229
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:45,590
The chain's jammed.

1230
01:22:45,711 --> 01:22:47,008
Oh.

1231
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:48,259
All right.

1232
01:22:49,089 --> 01:22:50,386
Try it now.

1233
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:57,105
Come on. Let's go.

1234
01:22:57,931 --> 01:23:00,275
Let's go! Come on.
We got to get you back.

1235
01:23:09,568 --> 01:23:11,128
Hey! Get...
Get down! I said I'd get it!

1236
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:12,404
Come on, let's go!

1237
01:23:12,613 --> 01:23:15,958
You'll get it'? I'll get it,
I swear. Come on. You gots to go.

1238
01:23:17,618 --> 01:23:19,620
Let's go, big boy. Come on.
Go, go.

1239
01:23:22,789 --> 01:23:25,292
Hey! You can't just walk away
from me. I own your ass!

1240
01:23:25,584 --> 01:23:27,184
Not when I'm behind the wheel,
you don't.

1241
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:28,372
Your contract <i>says</i> that I...

1242
01:23:28,462 --> 01:23:31,966
My contract says, "Love Handle
Enterprises," that's you

1243
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:34,009
"understands,
acknowledges and agrees

1244
01:23:34,092 --> 01:23:35,935
"that Twin Darling,
Inc...", that's me,

1245
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:38,389
"is not a partner,
employee or joint venturer

1246
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:40,600
"with Love Handle Enterprises".

1247
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:43,310
Drivers in cars win races, Max.

1248
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:46,025
Nobody's rooting for your drink
to cross the finish line,

1249
01:23:46,104 --> 01:23:48,323
so shut your piehole
before I shut it for you.

1250
01:23:48,649 --> 01:23:51,323
Do you know what the words
"stop payment" mean?

1251
01:23:58,325 --> 01:24:01,329
Hey... Hey!
You're... You're that guy!

1252
01:24:04,331 --> 01:24:06,504
<i>Mellie should
have been back by now.</i>

1253
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:11,680
Well, Aunt Mellie normally does
what she says she's gonna do.

1254
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:13,632
Let's give her
a few more minutes

1255
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,262
and hope she
doesn't go all Logan

1256
01:24:15,342 --> 01:24:17,686
and become a total
flake like the rest of them.

1257
01:24:18,345 --> 01:24:19,346
Good.

1258
01:24:30,524 --> 01:24:31,821
All good?

1259
01:24:32,025 --> 01:24:34,699
Bumpy on the way out,
but we're doing okay.

1260
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:37,331
Where'd your arm go?
I mean, your hand?

1261
01:24:37,531 --> 01:24:39,533
Can we haul ass?

1262
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:34,922
The cafeteria
fire alarm just went off.

1263
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:36,973
Warden, we got to call this in.

1264
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:39,472
We don't have fires at Monroe.

1265
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:42,513
Sir, we don't know what kind of
shape those guards are gonna be in.

1266
01:25:42,596 --> 01:25:45,145
I mean... They could be
dead or worse by now.

1267
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:48,685
And what do you
reckon be worse than dead?

1268
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:51,609
Uh...

1269
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:53,440
Shit! Call it in!

1270
01:25:53,523 --> 01:25:56,823
We have a three-alarm fire at
Monroe Correctional Facility.

1271
01:25:56,902 --> 01:25:58,449
Please respond immediately.

1272
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:00,538
<i>They report a fire
in a cafeteria.</i>

1273
01:26:00,614 --> 01:26:04,585
<i>I repeat, a fire in the Monroe
Correctional Facility cafeteria.</i>

1274
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:27,208
Do not tell me you've been
spraying her hair with this!

1275
01:27:27,325 --> 01:27:29,419
This will turn her
hair into an SOS pad.

1276
01:27:29,494 --> 01:27:32,338
I was doing the best I could!
You were late!

1277
01:27:32,414 --> 01:27:34,667
Oh, like you never brushed your
own daughter's hair before.

1278
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:37,424
I wish you all wouldn't fight.
You're making me more nervous.

1279
01:27:37,794 --> 01:27:39,137
You're right, baby doll.

1280
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:41,298
Is Daddy here?

1281
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:45,344
I didn't see him.
I was rushing.

1282
01:27:45,844 --> 01:27:47,346
Did your daddy
say he was coming?

1283
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:49,352
Yeah. Why?

1284
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:52,442
<i>I don't know. {just
thought he was working.</i>

1285
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:55,066
<i>What? That job at the Speedway?
I heard he got fired.</i>

1286
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,107
<i>Funny how he
never brought that up.</i>

1287
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:02,702
<i>You look like</i> a <i>princess.
You're gonna do great.</i>

1288
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:21,595
I thought maybe you'd run off.

1289
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:24,175
And leave you,
beautiful? Never.

1290
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:27,977
You know, we got caught on the
other side of that there gate

1291
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:29,896
when the lockdown happened.

1292
01:28:30,931 --> 01:28:32,308
It was terrifying.

<i>For her talent, Sadie Logan will

01:29:18,937 --> 01:29:20,610

Why go to all
the trouble to rob a place

1355
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:14,843
if you don't have the guts

1364
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:12,147
<i>Well, we brought everyone
in at 6:00 this morning.</i>

1365
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:14,904
Couldn't work all weekend, you know,
'cause of the race, obviously.

1366
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:17,660
But everything was just like
we left it on Friday.

1367
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:19,495
How many men
do you have working today?

1368
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:21,493
Well, 40 or so.

1369
01:34:21,573 --> 01:34:23,826
I guess we're on
a bit of a tight deadline

1370
01:34:23,908 --> 01:34:26,331
'cause they're trying to
get everything shored up,

I'm gonna need prints
from all your guys.

1374
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:37,346
Well, sure, but all the workers

1375
01:34:37,422 --> 01:34:39,516
have to wear protective
gloves at all times.

1376
01:34:39,591 --> 01:34:41,514
That's...
Well, it's a union rule.

01:34:41,593 --> 01:34:43,436
Union rules.
Yep.

01:34:48,766 --> 01:34:52,111
Swears they saw the robbers,
can definitely identify 'em.

1381
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:55,444
Yeah, I saw 'em.
I know who they are, too.

1382
01:34:55,773 --> 01:34:57,533
Why don't we
start at the beginning.

1383
01:34:57,692 --> 01:34:58,909
Where'd you see them?

1384
01:34:58,985 --> 01:35:00,703
In a tunnel,
leading from the track back

1385
01:35:00,778 --> 01:35:02,155
to the shower
room and the lockers.

1386
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:04,203
<i>There's
a saying in our business,</i>

1387
01:35:04,282 --> 01:35:05,829
<i>"Set it up and shut up",</i>

1388
01:35:05,909 --> 01:35:07,456
<i>so I'll shut up.</i>

1389
01:35:08,286 --> 01:35:10,129
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

1390
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:12,044
<i>You call yourself a driver?</i>

1391
01:35:12,123 --> 01:35:14,046
<i>What, you've never been
boxed in a turn before?</i>

1392
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:15,593
<i>I told you I didn't
want to drink your poison.</i>

1393
01:35:15,668 --> 01:35:16,715
<i>I thought I was having
a heart attack!</i>

1394
01:35:16,794 --> 01:35:17,841
<i>That poison...</i>

1395
01:35:17,921 --> 01:35:19,923
Hey, hey.
Can't one of you hit mute?

1396
01:35:20,048 --> 01:35:22,392
I'm trying to give my
statement to the FBI here.

1397
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:25,933
There was two of 'em. Right?
Now one of 'em was a bartender

1398
01:35:26,012 --> 01:35:28,561
from that place out off
of I-17. Got one arm.

1399
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:30,280
The guy with him,
I don't know who he was.

1400
01:35:30,934 --> 01:35:32,732
And you know the bartender from?

1401
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:34,858
A while back,
I got in a fight at the bar.

1402
01:35:34,938 --> 01:35:36,986
- With the bartender?
- No, with his brother.

1403
01:35:37,065 --> 01:35:38,908
Did the brother
have one arm or two?

1404
01:35:39,234 --> 01:35:40,656
The brother's got both.

1405
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:43,492
And the fight was about?

1406
01:35:43,821 --> 01:35:45,038
I can't remember.

1407
01:35:45,114 --> 01:35:46,991
And you won
that fight at the bar?

1408
01:35:47,075 --> 01:35:48,292
Hell, yeah, I won it!

1409
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:50,833
So you saw
the bartender with one arm

1410
01:35:51,329 --> 01:35:54,424
and an unknown male companion
in the tunnel during the race?

1411
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:56,668
And they were?

1412
01:35:57,001 --> 01:36:01,006
Well, they was just walking,
but it was suspicious-like.

1413
01:36:01,673 --> 01:36:03,346
Suspicious how?

1414
01:36:03,508 --> 01:36:06,307
They shouldn't have been down there.
That was suspicious.

1415
01:36:06,678 --> 01:36:09,227
But you didn't think to mention
this encounter to anyone

1416
01:36:09,305 --> 01:36:11,683
until you saw the news on the
television about the robbery?

1417
01:36:12,183 --> 01:36:13,981
The docs had to set
my nose, all right?

1418
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:15,186
I've been in recovery.

1419
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:17,780
So all these
injuries are the result

1420
01:36:17,855 --> 01:36:19,375
of your latest
fight with the brothers?

1421
01:36:19,857 --> 01:36:20,949
Bartender brother.

1422
01:36:21,025 --> 01:36:22,618
He's the one that
punched me in the tunnel.

1423
01:36:22,694 --> 01:36:23,741
The one-arm?

1424
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:25,914
Yeah, look, just ask
my driver, Dayton White.

1425
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:27,616
Right? He was with me
when all this went down.

1426
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:28,825
He'll back up my story.

1427
01:36:30,451 --> 01:36:32,453
Yes, when you called in
your tip, you mentioned

1428
01:36:32,537 --> 01:36:34,539
that he'd be able
to corroborate your story.

1429
01:36:35,707 --> 01:36:37,630
We spoke with
Dayton White earlier today.

1430
01:36:38,876 --> 01:36:41,720
He stated he was never in the
tunnel with you during the race.

1431
01:36:42,463 --> 01:36:44,682
Never saw two suspicious men.

1432
01:36:45,216 --> 01:36:47,059
And has no idea
what you're talking about.

1433
01:37:10,575 --> 01:37:12,248
Did you talk to him?

1434
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:13,878
I think you knows better.

1435
01:37:24,088 --> 01:37:26,466
I stopped by the
trailer when he wasn't home.

1436
01:37:27,759 --> 01:37:29,636
I think I got
most of your stuff.

1437
01:37:30,762 --> 01:37:33,106
You sure love your books.

1438
01:37:34,098 --> 01:37:36,100
And there's some
mail there, too.

1439
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:09,975
<i>Visitation logs</i>

1440
01:38:10,176 --> 01:38:12,850
indicate that Jimmy Logan,
an employee

1441
01:38:12,929 --> 01:38:14,647
recently fired
from the Speedway,

1442
01:38:15,098 --> 01:38:18,773
came with his brother Clyde
to see Joseph Bang here,

1443
01:38:19,102 --> 01:38:20,649
on April 15th.

1444
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:23,152
They returned two days later
for a second visit.

1445
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:27,072
Now, we only have video
of this meeting, no audio,

1446
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:29,074
so we have no idea
what they discussed.

1447
01:38:30,321 --> 01:38:31,914
But the following week,

1448
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:34,663
Clyde Logan drives through the
window of a Corner Save Mart

1449
01:38:35,660 --> 01:38:38,379
and ends up being sentenced
to 90 days here.

1450
01:38:39,497 --> 01:38:43,001
You seem to have a lot of information
in your FBI folders there.

1451
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:46,754
And so?

1452
01:38:47,255 --> 01:38:49,508
You don't think that's
an incredible coincidence?

1453
01:38:53,010 --> 01:38:54,853
No. Not really.

1454
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:59,734
I mean, if you're asking me, am I shocked
that the criminals locked up in here

1455
01:38:59,809 --> 01:39:01,982
are friends with other criminals?
No, I'm not.

1456
01:39:07,358 --> 01:39:10,737
So Clyde Logan and Joseph Bang
were incarcerated here

1457
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:12,538
at your prison on May the 28th.

1458
01:39:12,613 --> 01:39:14,536
And you had no problems,

1459
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:18,207
no issues of any kind
at your prison on that day?

1460
01:39:18,286 --> 01:39:19,458
Is that right?

1461
01:39:19,537 --> 01:39:21,460
No, we didn't have any problems.

1462
01:39:21,539 --> 01:39:23,712
Right. 'Cause Monroe
County Fire Department

1463
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:25,151
said they
dispatched multiple units

1464
01:39:25,209 --> 01:39:27,303
around 8:30 p.m. that night.

1465
01:39:27,378 --> 01:39:29,346
There was a small kitchen fire,

1466
01:39:29,422 --> 01:39:32,301
but that's not a problem
in the context of this prison.

1467
01:39:33,301 --> 01:39:35,099
I mean, it's
standard operating procedure

1468
01:39:35,178 --> 01:39:38,307
for them to
dispatch multiple units

1469
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:40,482
any time there's
a fire at the prison.

1470
01:39:41,392 --> 01:39:45,238
That was no big deal. It was
out within a few minutes.

1471
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:50,618
You're certain
that these two inmates

1472
01:39:50,693 --> 01:39:52,240
couldn't have
broken out of here,

1473
01:39:52,570 --> 01:39:55,164
robbed the Speedway and then
broken back into your prison

1474
01:39:55,239 --> 01:39:56,707
without you knowing about it?

1475
01:39:57,408 --> 01:39:59,502
Wow!

1476
01:39:59,577 --> 01:40:00,749
No.

1477
01:40:01,579 --> 01:40:05,959
Agent Grayson, I've been warden here for
nine years and I can tell you this.

1478
01:40:07,752 --> 01:40:10,130
We don't have
an escape problem at Monroe.

1479
01:40:12,256 --> 01:40:13,599
<i>What do you
think of the robbery?</i>

1480
01:40:13,674 --> 01:40:16,928
<i>Well, I heard that they're
calling it "Ocean's 7-Eleven",</i>

1481
01:40:17,428 --> 01:40:20,602
<i>'cause they found that truck with the
money behind a convenience store.</i>

1482
01:40:21,599 --> 01:40:23,897
<i>Uh, {heard that they're
calling 'em the Redneck Robbers,</i>

1483
01:40:23,976 --> 01:40:25,853
<i>'cause they think the guys
who did this whole thing</i>

1484
01:40:25,937 --> 01:40:28,315
<i>are from around here.
I hope they never catch 'em.</i>

1485
01:40:29,106 --> 01:40:30,906
<i>Where does
this investigation stand?</i>

1486
01:40:31,025 --> 01:40:32,197
<i>Well, let me tell you this.</i>

1487
01:40:32,276 --> 01:40:34,119
<i>Even though the crime was
committed in Charlotte,</i>

1488
01:40:34,195 --> 01:40:36,539
<i>the fact that
the money was recovered here</i>

1489
01:40:36,614 --> 01:40:38,036
<i>makes it a very serious matter.</i>

1490
01:40:38,282 --> 01:40:40,501
<i>We're involving all
of our local, state...</i>

1491
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:42,745
You have a problem
with the food here, inmate?

1492
01:40:42,828 --> 01:40:45,832
No, no, no, Warden.
No problem.

1493
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:49,135
Reckon your stomach's
not been bothering you lately?

1494
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:51,178
No, Warden, no.

1495
01:40:51,712 --> 01:40:53,714
Thank...
Thank you for asking me.

1496
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:00,643
You best be
cleaning up your mess.

1497
01:41:02,056 --> 01:41:04,058
Now!
Sir.

1498
01:41:07,937 --> 01:41:09,029
Huh?

1499
01:41:15,903 --> 01:41:17,655
What'd you say to me, inmate?

1500
01:41:19,824 --> 01:41:20,996
Go on.

1501
01:41:23,828 --> 01:41:25,171
Thank you.

1502
01:41:27,832 --> 01:41:30,381
<i>What about the
disgruntled fired employee?</i>

1503
01:41:31,002 --> 01:41:32,424
<i>The brother of
the one-armed bartender?</i>

1504
01:41:32,503 --> 01:41:36,053
Jimmy Logan was fired
six weeks before the robbery.

1505
01:41:36,132 --> 01:41:38,931
His brother, Clyde, is
the one-armed bartender

1506
01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:42,105
Max Chilblain claims to
have seen during the race.

1507
01:41:42,179 --> 01:41:44,477
But we know there's
no way Clyde Logan

1508
01:41:44,557 --> 01:41:46,237
could have been in
that underground walkway

1509
01:41:46,309 --> 01:41:49,108
because he was serving time at
the Monroe Correctional Facility

1510
01:41:49,186 --> 01:41:50,813
on the day of the robbery.

1511
01:41:51,856 --> 01:41:52,982
Hmm.

1512
01:41:55,526 --> 01:41:57,199
I hate airtight alibis.

1513
01:41:58,988 --> 01:42:00,160
Where did Jimmy
Logan's cell phone

1514
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:01,616
tell us he was during the race?

1515
01:42:01,699 --> 01:42:03,542
Jimmy Logan doesn't
have a cell phone.

1516
01:42:03,618 --> 01:42:06,087
Shut off three months
ago for non-payment.

1517
01:42:06,704 --> 01:42:10,504
He also drives
a 1983 Ford F-150,

1518
01:42:10,583 --> 01:42:12,130
so no GPS.

1519
01:42:12,376 --> 01:42:14,879
No email, no social media.

1520
01:42:15,379 --> 01:42:16,722
We did get a few
hits on his name

1521
01:42:16,797 --> 01:42:18,265
on other social media accounts,

1522
01:42:18,341 --> 01:42:21,811
which place him at Valley View
High School during the race.

1523
01:42:21,886 --> 01:42:25,516
His daughter was competing in the
Miss Pretty West Virginia Pageant.

1524
01:42:25,598 --> 01:42:27,271
And apparently she won.

1525
01:43:04,595 --> 01:43:06,268
How's your brother?

1526
01:43:08,265 --> 01:43:09,892
I wouldn't know.

1527
01:43:11,602 --> 01:43:13,775
You haven't talked to him?
Nope.

1528
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:18,113
Not once?

1529
01:43:18,943 --> 01:43:20,490
Nope.

1530
01:43:22,113 --> 01:43:24,457
Well, it seems
strange, you know,

1531
01:43:25,616 --> 01:43:28,290
you two being so close and all.

1532
01:43:29,954 --> 01:43:33,458
Last I heard, he moved south
to be closer to his daughter.

1533
01:43:37,294 --> 01:43:39,046
How far south?

1534
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:40,302
Lynchburg.

1535
01:43:43,634 --> 01:43:45,011
Guess his ex moved down there

1536
01:43:45,094 --> 01:43:48,644
when her husband
opened a new car lot.

1537
01:43:53,310 --> 01:43:54,482
Well,

1538
01:43:55,312 --> 01:43:57,986
if you do speak to him...

1539
01:44:01,318 --> 01:44:03,412
Tell him I'd
like to talk to him.

1540
01:44:03,988 --> 01:44:05,831
I doubt I'll be talking to him.

1541
01:44:20,337 --> 01:44:24,843
He never told you why
he gave all that money back?

1542
01:44:34,685 --> 01:44:36,028
On the house.

1543
01:44:39,607 --> 01:44:40,950
Generous.

1544
01:44:44,278 --> 01:44:47,623
You've had your six months,
and you made no arrests.

1545
01:44:48,532 --> 01:44:50,034
Meanwhile, the locals
talk about these thieves

1546
01:44:50,117 --> 01:44:52,540
like they're some type
of Hee Haw Heroes.

1547
01:44:54,038 --> 01:44:57,793
So, we would like
to move forward

1548
01:44:57,875 --> 01:44:59,252
and put this entire incident

1549
01:44:59,335 --> 01:45:01,884
in our rearview mirror,
if you will.

1550
01:45:02,713 --> 01:45:03,714
Okay?

1551
01:45:11,305 --> 01:45:12,773
Thank you again.

1552
01:45:14,391 --> 01:45:16,393
I do have one last question.

1553
01:45:17,144 --> 01:45:18,145
Sure.

1554
01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:21,278
You just said you received a
payout from your insurance company

1555
01:45:21,357 --> 01:45:23,234
for the money that
wasn't recovered.

1556
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:25,160
Yes. That's right.

1557
01:45:25,611 --> 01:45:26,703
Hmm.

1558
01:45:27,238 --> 01:45:30,583
We were here with forensic
accountants for weeks

1559
01:45:30,658 --> 01:45:33,161
poring over the register
logs and receipts.

1560
01:45:34,078 --> 01:45:37,002
No one here was ever able
to give us an exact accounting

1561
01:45:37,081 --> 01:45:39,129
of how much money
was actually stolen.

1562
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:42,757
Right, um... It's...
Well, it's very complex.

1563
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:44,179
The algorithm and whatnot.

1564
01:45:44,421 --> 01:45:46,301
Yeah, we heard about
the complicated algorithms.

1565
01:45:47,758 --> 01:45:50,432
So how did you arrive
at the number to ask for?

1566
01:45:50,761 --> 01:45:53,264
If you didn't know
how much was stolen.

1567
01:45:54,431 --> 01:45:59,278
I'm not an accountant, so, uh, I
wasn't in there for those discussions.

1568
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:04,116
But as far as all of us here at
Charlotte Motor Speedway are concerned,

1569
01:46:04,441 --> 01:46:07,615
the matter has been resolved
to our satisfaction.

1570
01:46:47,318 --> 01:46:48,661
Assholes.

1571
01:47:35,366 --> 01:47:39,542
You seriously want to trust
these two with our lives?

1572
01:47:40,454 --> 01:47:42,627
They're gonna know
what we want 'em to know.

1573
01:48:26,083 --> 01:48:28,085
All right!
But we can get two more.

1574
01:48:28,168 --> 01:48:29,670
What's rule eight?

1575
01:48:29,753 --> 01:48:30,754
"Don't get greedy."

1576
01:48:30,838 --> 01:48:34,012
All right, you're done here. Come on,
you got to get the car anyway. Go!

1577
01:49:27,811 --> 01:49:31,156
Yeah, you're right there. You're right
on top of it. Just dig in there.

1578
01:49:44,995 --> 01:49:46,338
Mr. Naaman?

1579
01:49:50,834 --> 01:49:52,802
Oh, this one's addressed to you.

1580
01:49:52,878 --> 01:49:55,006
Came in through
the donation box.

1581
01:49:55,506 --> 01:49:57,850
It's heavy,
but don't get excited.

1582
01:49:58,092 --> 01:50:01,437
It's got to be from a crazy, written
with crayon. Know what I mean?

1583
01:50:40,551 --> 01:50:42,224
Where to, Mr. Naaman?

1584
01:51:01,238 --> 01:51:03,036
Hey.
Hi.

1585
01:51:04,658 --> 01:51:05,750
New job?

1586
01:51:06,743 --> 01:51:09,087
Yeah. It's just seasonal.

1587
01:51:09,329 --> 01:51:12,754
I hope they keep me on, though.
It's nice being close to home.

1588
01:51:13,584 --> 01:51:15,086
You want to come in?

1589
01:51:15,752 --> 01:51:17,254
No, no. I'll just wait.

1590
01:51:17,421 --> 01:51:19,594
Daddy!
Hey! What's up, ma“?

1591
01:51:20,007 --> 01:51:21,509
Body slam!

1592
01:51:22,593 --> 01:51:24,266
What time you want her back?

1593
01:51:24,511 --> 01:51:26,513
Whatever time
works best for you.

1594
01:51:26,763 --> 01:51:28,606
We're just around.
All right.

1595
01:51:28,682 --> 01:51:30,184
Don't wait up!

1596
01:51:31,435 --> 01:51:34,655
All right. So I was
thinking putt-putt golf.

1597
01:51:35,147 --> 01:51:36,990
They got those new
go-karts down there.

1598
01:51:37,065 --> 01:51:39,443
Sure. As long as
we get gelato after.

1599
01:51:39,526 --> 01:51:40,743
Gelato?
Yeah.

1600
01:51:40,819 --> 01:51:42,662
Ain't that like fancy ice cream?

1601
01:51:42,738 --> 01:51:44,911
I thought you couldn't do that
'cause of your pageants.

1602
01:51:44,990 --> 01:51:46,537
Oh, I'm over all that stuff.

1603
01:51:46,617 --> 01:51:49,712
I've been really getting into
the culinary arts lately.

1604
01:51:49,786 --> 01:51:51,129
<i>Oh, cum-what'?</i>

1605
01:51:51,455 --> 01:51:54,459
Cooking! I've been
watching a lot of Top Chef.

1606
01:51:55,417 --> 01:51:56,509
Really?
Yeah.

1607
01:51:56,585 --> 01:52:00,806
I've been learning a lot. Like how
gelato isn't just fancy ice cream.

1608
01:52:00,881 --> 01:52:02,849
It's made at a slower
churn rate than ice cream,

1609
01:52:02,925 --> 01:52:04,723
so less air gets mixed in.

1610
01:52:04,801 --> 01:52:07,304
That's why it has
such a silky texture.

1611
01:52:07,638 --> 01:52:08,810
A churn rate, huh?

1612
01:52:09,139 --> 01:52:12,143
Yeah, a churn rate. How fast the
paddle in the machine moves.

1613
01:52:12,392 --> 01:52:14,895
Sometimes the paddle
is called a dasher.

1614
01:52:15,145 --> 01:52:18,490
Oh, yeah, no,
I know what that is. A dasher.

1615
01:52:18,815 --> 01:52:22,490
It's kinda like
Dasher and Dancer and Vixen.

1616
01:52:22,819 --> 01:52:24,162
No. Daddy!

1617
01:52:24,488 --> 01:52:26,490
I know exactly what that is.
No, it's not that.

1618
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:28,742
I didn't know that
reindeer made ice cream.

1619
01:52:28,992 --> 01:52:30,665
They don't!

1620
01:52:31,995 --> 01:52:33,121
You funny.

1621
01:52:33,205 --> 01:52:34,957
You funny.
You funny-looking.

1622
01:52:45,342 --> 01:52:48,016
You never told me how you
knew the coast was clear

1623
01:52:48,095 --> 01:52:50,018
and we could go get the money.

1624
01:52:51,515 --> 01:52:53,768
Well, you know how
that phone company

1625
01:52:53,850 --> 01:52:56,023
that give you about 60 days
to pay that phone bill?

1626
01:52:56,353 --> 01:53:00,199
Yeah. Well, you go one day over
and they shut your phone off.

1627
01:53:00,524 --> 01:53:01,525
So?

1628
01:53:04,194 --> 01:53:07,869
I ain't paid the bill out at the
trailer in like six months.

1629
01:53:08,115 --> 01:53:09,287
So?

1630
01:53:10,033 --> 01:53:12,877
I figured long as they was tapping
my phone, they'd keep it on.

1631
01:53:13,203 --> 01:53:16,047
About a week ago,
it finally went dead.

1632
01:53:19,376 --> 01:53:21,049
That's pretty good.
Yeah.

1633
01:53:21,878 --> 01:53:23,198
You came up with
that on your own?

1634
01:53:23,255 --> 01:53:24,347
Yes, I did.

1635
01:53:24,881 --> 01:53:27,384
Well, that's a lot of thinking for a Logan.

1636
01:53:39,604 --> 01:53:41,231
Hey, Jimmy.
Hey.

1637
01:53:43,025 --> 01:53:44,368
What you doing?

1638
01:53:46,403 --> 01:53:47,905
So, Mellie...

1639
01:53:50,574 --> 01:53:54,920
What do you make of all
this Logan Curse stuff?

1640
01:53:55,579 --> 01:53:59,459
Well, that's Clyde's thing. I never
really gave it that much thought.

1641
01:54:00,584 --> 01:54:03,758
What about you? You think we're
destined to repeat the past?

1642
01:54:06,173 --> 01:54:07,265
No.

1643
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:11,762
I'm all about the future.

1644
01:54:16,099 --> 01:54:19,694
Oh, shoot. Sorry about that.
Another Especial for the lady?

1645
01:54:19,770 --> 01:54:21,772
Yeah.
I missed out on the toast.

1646
01:54:21,855 --> 01:54:24,779
You know they say it's bad luck
to toast with an empty glass.

1647
01:54:25,525 --> 01:54:26,868
They do say that.

1648
01:54:26,943 --> 01:54:29,412
It's also bad luck
to toast alone, so,

1649
01:54:29,488 --> 01:54:31,206
why don't you pour
yourself one on me?

1650
01:54:31,281 --> 01:54:33,033
So you don't jinx me.

1651
01:54:36,953 --> 01:54:39,633
I would have remembered if
you'd ever been in the bar before.

1652
01:54:41,083 --> 01:54:44,053
- Are you just passing through?
- Yeah. Passing through.

1653
01:54:46,213 --> 01:54:48,136
But I'm hoping to stay a while.

1654
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:51,973
Well, then...

1655
01:54:53,553 --> 01:54:55,226
Here's to staying a while.

1656
