1
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:00,431
I wish you wouldn't
do that around me.
It's so filthy!

2
00:03:00,432 --> 00:03:04,068
Don't give me a problem
about the cigarettes.
It's such a filthy habit.

3
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:05,559
Oh, my God!

4
00:03:05,704 --> 00:03:07,194
Look at this.

5
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:12,738
Oh, Jesus.
This is so appalling.

6
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:15,946
I can't believe it.

7
00:03:15,948 --> 00:03:18,416
I can't believe
they gave it to him.

8
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,691
Ah, this is pathetic.

9
00:03:26,692 --> 00:03:28,993
Now he's a loser
with a Jaguar.

10
00:03:28,994 --> 00:03:31,929
Seriously,
who did he have to blow
to get that thing?

11
00:03:33,899 --> 00:03:36,100
Good morning, sir.
Mr. Willis.

12
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:37,535
It's really a...

13
00:03:37,536 --> 00:03:38,867
Mr. Trask!

14
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:40,938
Quite a piece
of machinery.

15
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:43,541
Good morning, Havemeyer.
Morning to you, sir.

16
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:44,702
Bene!

17
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,844
Bene?
Bene! Fabulous!

18
00:03:46,845 --> 00:03:48,212
What's fabulous?

19
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:50,514
That fine piece of steel
you have back there.

20
00:03:50,515 --> 00:03:52,575
Ah, you don't think
I deserve it.

21
00:03:53,085 --> 00:03:54,919
No, sir.
On the contrary.

22
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,954
I think
it's great.

23
00:03:56,955 --> 00:03:59,657
Why should the
headmaster of Baird
be seen putt-putting

24
00:03:59,658 --> 00:04:01,492
around in some junker?

25
00:04:01,493 --> 00:04:04,061
In fact, I think the
board of trustees have had

26
00:04:04,062 --> 00:04:07,431
their first true stroke
of inspiration in some time.

27
00:04:07,432 --> 00:04:09,934
Well, thank you,
Havemeyer.

28
00:04:09,935 --> 00:04:12,103
I'll take that at face value.

29
00:04:12,104 --> 00:04:14,197
I'd expect
nothing less, sir.

30
00:04:14,973 --> 00:04:16,600
Have a good day.

31
00:04:18,977 --> 00:04:20,911
Morning,
Mrs. Hunsaker.
Good morning.

32
00:04:20,912 --> 00:04:23,575
What have we here,
Murderer's Row?

33
00:04:30,288 --> 00:04:31,555
What was that about?

34
00:04:31,556 --> 00:04:33,090
Nothing. Just saying hello.

35
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:35,287
I like to say hello
to Headmaster Trask.

36
00:04:36,294 --> 00:04:39,430
Sugarbush. Lift tickets
and condo vouchers.

37
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:41,298
I thought we were
going to Stowe.

38
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:43,334
Sugarbush
is Stowe, Jimmy.

39
00:04:43,335 --> 00:04:45,102
This year we're
doing it right.

40
00:04:45,103 --> 00:04:47,938
Thanksgiving in Vermont,
Christmas in Switzerland...

41
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:50,174
Christmas in Gstaad
is gonna cost us...
"Staad."

42
00:04:50,175 --> 00:04:51,542
The "G" is silent.

43
00:04:51,543 --> 00:04:53,068
"Staad." George?

44
00:04:53,345 --> 00:04:54,745
"Staad."
Trent?

45
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:57,048
"Staad," man.
So what about Staad?

46
00:04:57,049 --> 00:04:58,916
Fine. The "G" may
be silent,

47
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:01,652
but it's gonna take at least
three grand to get there.

48
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:03,354
I'll have to talk
to my father.

49
00:05:03,355 --> 00:05:06,123
Better yet,
have my father
talk to your father.

50
00:05:06,124 --> 00:05:08,093
Or my father
talk to your father.

51
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:12,530
You going home
this weekend, Chas?

52
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:15,533
I don't know.

53
00:05:15,534 --> 00:05:18,269
You going home
to fuckin' Idaho
for Thanksgiving?

54
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,794
I'm from Oregon.

55
00:05:20,338 --> 00:05:22,606
I meant
fuckin' Oregon.

56
00:05:22,607 --> 00:05:24,642
Charlie, how do you
feel about skiing?

57
00:05:25,944 --> 00:05:28,709
You in the mood for
the white-bosomed
slopes of Vermont?

58
00:05:30,582 --> 00:05:32,082
Got a deal going.

59
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,551
20% off for
my friends.

60
00:05:33,552 --> 00:05:35,085
My father set it up.

61
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:36,587
Christmas
in Switzerland.

62
00:05:36,588 --> 00:05:38,923
Staad.
Gstaad.
Dropping the "G" is phony.

63
00:05:38,924 --> 00:05:40,558
You said
everybody
says "Staad."

64
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:42,058
Not if you've
been there.

65
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:45,463
Easter in Bermuda,
then Kentucky Derby
weekend.

66
00:05:45,464 --> 00:05:47,665
We could fit
you in, kid.

67
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:51,602
Well, how much are
these white-bosomed
slopes of Vermont?

68
00:05:51,603 --> 00:05:53,604
1,200.

69
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:57,875
Includes a nine-course,
champagne
Thanksgiving dinner.

70
00:05:57,876 --> 00:06:01,612
$1,200 is a little rich
for my blood, Harry.

71
00:06:01,613 --> 00:06:03,747
Well, how short
are you?

72
00:06:03,748 --> 00:06:05,916
How short, Harry?

73
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:09,547
So short it wouldn't be
worth the trouble
of you and George to measure.

74
00:06:09,688 --> 00:06:11,222
But thanks for askin',
all right?

75
00:06:11,223 --> 00:06:12,690
Mmm-hmm.

76
00:06:12,691 --> 00:06:14,425
If you change
your mind...

77
00:06:14,426 --> 00:06:16,861
What'd you do that for?
You know he's on aid.

78
00:06:16,862 --> 00:06:18,362
On major
holidays, Willis,

79
00:06:18,363 --> 00:06:20,130
it's customary
for the lord of the manor

80
00:06:20,131 --> 00:06:21,432
to offer drippings
to the poor.

81
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:22,832
You're so
full of shit!

82
00:06:49,928 --> 00:06:51,157
Hi. Mrs. Rossi?

83
00:06:51,463 --> 00:06:52,657
Yes?

84
00:06:52,931 --> 00:06:54,626
I'm here about
the weekend job.

85
00:06:56,535 --> 00:06:58,469
Come on in.

86
00:07:02,674 --> 00:07:06,210
Does he got pimples?
He hates pimples.

87
00:07:06,211 --> 00:07:07,811
Francine, be quiet.

88
00:07:07,812 --> 00:07:10,407
Pimples.
Pimples. Yeah.

89
00:07:10,615 --> 00:07:11,982
Shush!

90
00:07:11,983 --> 00:07:14,952
I'm sorry. The school
gave me your name,
but I've forgotten it.

91
00:07:14,953 --> 00:07:16,520
It's Charlie Simms.

92
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:18,556
How are you,
Charlie?
Fine, thanks.

93
00:07:18,557 --> 00:07:19,717
Right this way.

94
00:07:23,562 --> 00:07:25,930
You're available
the whole weekend?

95
00:07:25,931 --> 00:07:27,231
Yeah.

96
00:07:27,232 --> 00:07:29,166
Not going home
for Thanksgiving?
No.

97
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:30,430
Good.

98
00:07:32,671 --> 00:07:35,639
They put him in
a veteran's home,
but he hated it,

99
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,768
so I told my dad
that we'd take him.

100
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:43,247
Before you go in,
do you mind my
telling you a few things?

101
00:07:43,248 --> 00:07:47,185
Don't "sir" him
and don't ask him
too many questions.

102
00:07:47,686 --> 00:07:49,920
And if he
staggers a little
when he gets up,

103
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:51,389
don't pay
any attention.

104
00:07:52,724 --> 00:07:56,683
Charlie,
I can tell you're
the right person for the job.

105
00:07:57,228 --> 00:07:59,459
And Uncle Frank's
gonna like you a lot, too.

106
00:08:01,466 --> 00:08:04,101
Where you gonna be
this weekend?

107
00:08:04,102 --> 00:08:06,264
We're driving to Albany.

108
00:08:06,905 --> 00:08:10,432
Donny, my husband,
has family there.

109
00:08:15,814 --> 00:08:17,581
Do you want
Tommy in or out?

110
00:08:17,582 --> 00:08:19,149
Leave him out!

111
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,780
He's chasing that
Calico ginch from
the track houses again!

112
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,793
Down deep, the man
is a lump of sugar.

113
00:08:51,983 --> 00:08:53,517
Sir?

114
00:08:53,518 --> 00:08:55,486
Don't call me sir.

115
00:08:55,487 --> 00:08:57,054
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:57,055 --> 00:08:58,756
I mean mister, sir.

117
00:08:58,757 --> 00:09:02,926
Uh-oh, we got a moron here,
is that it?

118
00:09:02,927 --> 00:09:04,495
No, mister...

119
00:09:04,496 --> 00:09:05,986
That is...

120
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:09,967
Lieutenant.
Yes, sir...

121
00:09:09,968 --> 00:09:11,868
Lieutenant Colonel.

122
00:09:12,237 --> 00:09:16,105
Twenty-six years on the line,
nobody ever busted me
four grades before.

123
00:09:17,075 --> 00:09:18,702
Get in here,
you idiot!

124
00:09:25,684 --> 00:09:28,881
Come a little closer.
I wanna get a
better look at you.

125
00:09:37,696 --> 00:09:40,096
How's your skin, son?

126
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:42,466
My skin, sir?

127
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:44,201
Oh, for
Christ's sake.

128
00:09:44,202 --> 00:09:47,171
I'm sorry, I don...
Just call me Frank.

129
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:49,006
Call me Mr. Slade.

130
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:52,841
Call me Colonel,
if you must. Just don't
call me sir.

131
00:09:54,145 --> 00:09:55,977
All right, Colonel.

132
00:09:57,849 --> 00:09:59,283
Simms, Charles.

133
00:09:59,284 --> 00:10:00,651
A senior.

134
00:10:00,652 --> 00:10:02,519
You on
student aid, Simms?

135
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,181
Yes, I am.

136
00:10:04,622 --> 00:10:06,591
For "student aid"
read "crook."

137
00:10:08,026 --> 00:10:11,361
Your father
peddles car telephones
at a 300% markup.

138
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:14,198
Your mother works
on heavy commission
in a camera store.

139
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:17,167
Graduated to it
from espresso machines.

140
00:10:23,908 --> 00:10:27,401
What are you, dying of
some wasting disease?

141
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:31,538
No, I'm right...
I'm right here.

142
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,981
I know exactly where
your body is.

143
00:10:35,353 --> 00:10:38,323
What I'm lookin' for
is some
indication of a brain.

144
00:10:39,357 --> 00:10:41,849
Too much football
without a helmet?

145
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:45,727
Hah! Lyndon's line
on Gerry Ford.

146
00:10:47,132 --> 00:10:50,901
Deputy Debriefer, Paris,
Peace Talks, '66.

147
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:54,964
Snagged the Silver Star
and a silver bar.
Threw me into G-2.

148
00:10:55,774 --> 00:10:57,074
G-2?

149
00:10:57,075 --> 00:11:00,238
Intelligence,
of which you have none.

150
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:05,848
Where you from?

151
00:11:06,518 --> 00:11:08,042
Gresham, Oregon,

152
00:11:10,088 --> 00:11:11,321
Colonel.

153
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:13,882
What does your daddy do
in Gresham, Oregon?

154
00:11:14,392 --> 00:11:16,326
Hmm?
Count wood chips?

155
00:11:17,462 --> 00:11:21,331
My stepfather and my mom
run a convenience store.

156
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:24,393
How convenient.
What time they open?

157
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,437
5:00 a.m.

158
00:11:26,438 --> 00:11:27,496
Close?

159
00:11:27,739 --> 00:11:29,006
1:00 a.m.

160
00:11:29,007 --> 00:11:30,908
Hard workers.

161
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:32,809
You got me all
misty-eyed!

162
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:39,948
So, what are you doing here
in this sparrow-fart town?

163
00:11:41,052 --> 00:11:43,180
I attend Baird.

164
00:11:44,656 --> 00:11:46,146
Attend Baird!

165
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:50,260
I know you go
to the Baird school.

166
00:11:50,261 --> 00:11:53,297
Point is,
how do you afford it,

167
00:11:53,298 --> 00:11:57,997
even with the student aid
and the folks back home
hustlin' corn nuts?

168
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:03,240
I won a Young American
merit scholarship.

169
00:12:03,241 --> 00:12:05,073
Hoo-ah!

170
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:10,370
Glory, glory
Hallelujah

171
00:12:10,915 --> 00:12:14,374
Glory, glory
Hallelujah

172
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,782
Who's there?

173
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,188
That little
piece of tail?

174
00:12:25,463 --> 00:12:27,331
Get her outta here!

175
00:12:35,907 --> 00:12:37,272
Yeah.

176
00:12:39,077 --> 00:12:41,068
Can't believe
they're my blood.

177
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:50,454
IQ of sloths and
the manners of banshees.

178
00:12:50,455 --> 00:12:53,056
He's a mechanic,
she's a homemaker.

179
00:12:53,057 --> 00:12:55,526
He knows as much about cars
as a beauty queen,

180
00:12:55,527 --> 00:12:58,587
and she bakes cookies,
taste like wing nuts.

181
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,095
As for the tots,
they're twits.

182
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:05,734
How's your skin, son?
I like my aides
to be presentable.

183
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,574
Well, I...

184
00:13:10,575 --> 00:13:12,270
I've had a few zits.

185
00:13:13,545 --> 00:13:15,913
But my roommate,
he lent me his Clinique

186
00:13:15,914 --> 00:13:18,282
because he's from
Chestnut Hill
and he's got...

187
00:13:18,283 --> 00:13:20,945
"The History of My Skin,"
by Charles Simms.

188
00:13:22,253 --> 00:13:24,847
You patronizing me,
peewee? Hmm?

189
00:13:25,623 --> 00:13:28,354
You givin' me
that old prep school
palaver?

190
00:13:29,694 --> 00:13:30,923
Baird School!

191
00:13:32,497 --> 00:13:35,899
A bunch of runny-nosed
snots in tweed jackets

192
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,426
all studyin'
to be George Bush.

193
00:13:40,605 --> 00:13:42,606
Well...

194
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:45,303
I believe President Bush
went to Andover, Colonel.

195
00:13:48,713 --> 00:13:51,045
You sharpshootin'
me, punk?

196
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:54,509
Is that what
you're doin'?

197
00:13:55,486 --> 00:13:57,821
Don't you
sharpshoot me.

198
00:13:57,822 --> 00:14:00,357
You'll give me 40.

199
00:14:00,358 --> 00:14:02,993
Then you're gonna give me
40 more.

200
00:14:02,994 --> 00:14:06,730
Then you're gonna
pull K.P.,
the grease pit!

201
00:14:06,731 --> 00:14:10,567
I'll rub your nose
in enlisted men's crud

202
00:14:10,568 --> 00:14:12,502
till you don't
know which end is up!

203
00:14:13,104 --> 00:14:14,367
You understand?

204
00:14:15,707 --> 00:14:16,907
Yeah.

205
00:14:16,908 --> 00:14:18,239
What do you want?

206
00:14:18,409 --> 00:14:20,410
What do you mean,
what do I want?

207
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:21,845
What do you want here?

208
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:26,280
I want a job.

209
00:14:27,118 --> 00:14:29,019
A job!

210
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,254
Yeah, I want a job
so I can make, you know,

211
00:14:31,255 --> 00:14:34,020
my plane fare home
for Christmas.

212
00:14:34,993 --> 00:14:38,053
Oh, God,
you're touching!

213
00:14:50,475 --> 00:14:53,577
They used to waltz on the banks

214
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:57,014
Of the mighty Mississippi

215
00:14:57,015 --> 00:15:00,815
Loving the whole
night through

216
00:15:02,253 --> 00:15:05,889
Till the riverboat gambler

217
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:08,959
Went off to make a killin'

218
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,895
And bring it on back to you

219
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:14,898
Still here, poormouth?

220
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:16,196
Hmm?

221
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:19,603
Convenience store,

222
00:15:19,604 --> 00:15:20,867
my ass!

223
00:15:22,106 --> 00:15:26,168
Hustlin' jalapeno dips
to the appleseeds.

224
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:28,871
Go on.

225
00:15:29,681 --> 00:15:31,171
Dismissed.

226
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:35,776
Dismissed!

227
00:15:43,494 --> 00:15:46,430
Evangeline

228
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,195
Evangeline

229
00:15:49,934 --> 00:15:52,235
Mrs. Rossi?

230
00:15:52,236 --> 00:15:54,762
Charlie, we're up here!
Come on up.

231
00:15:57,175 --> 00:15:59,666
This is Donny.
Hey, Charlie.

232
00:16:00,111 --> 00:16:01,340
Hi.

233
00:16:01,746 --> 00:16:04,715
Mrs. Rossi, I got
the feelin' I screwed up.

234
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,150
Oh, you couldn't have.

235
00:16:07,151 --> 00:16:08,752
It was a
bad interview.

236
00:16:08,753 --> 00:16:10,721
That was no interview,
Charlie. You're it.

237
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:14,124
You're the only
one that showed up.
You have to take the job.

238
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:18,756
He sleeps a lot. You can
watch television,
call your girlfriend.

239
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,364
I promise you,
an easy 300 bucks.

240
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:24,959
I don't get
an easy feeling.

241
00:16:28,606 --> 00:16:30,574
His bark is worse
than his bite.

242
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:35,077
He was a great soldier,
a real hero.

243
00:16:36,881 --> 00:16:38,715
The man grows on you.

244
00:16:38,716 --> 00:16:40,810
By Sunday night,
you'll be best friends.

245
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,816
Charlie, please.

246
00:16:45,523 --> 00:16:48,024
I want to get
away with my husband
for a few days,

247
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:49,960
and Uncle Frank
won't come with us.

248
00:16:50,962 --> 00:16:53,830
Six months ago,
he could sometimes tell
light from dark,

249
00:16:53,831 --> 00:16:55,799
but now there's nothing.

250
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,826
I just feel better
having someone else
around just in case.

251
00:17:05,476 --> 00:17:06,773
Please?

252
00:17:10,047 --> 00:17:11,242
Okay, Mrs. Rossi.

253
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:12,809
Sure.

254
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:15,252
Thank you, Charlie.

255
00:17:15,253 --> 00:17:16,686
Come here, you.

256
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:26,796
There you go.

257
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:29,164
Chas. Chas, hold up.

258
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:32,936
How you doin'?
I'm good.

259
00:17:32,937 --> 00:17:34,234
That's great.

260
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:36,865
This can't go out.
This is on reserve.

261
00:17:40,545 --> 00:17:42,206
Here's the thing.

262
00:17:42,547 --> 00:17:45,072
I need the book tonight

263
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:48,785
for a Thanksgiving quiz
with big-shit Preston
in the morning.

264
00:17:48,786 --> 00:17:51,221
Yeah, I know.
That's why he
put it on reserve.

265
00:17:51,222 --> 00:17:52,589
This is our only copy.

266
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,025
Chas, I'm pullin'
an all-nighter.

267
00:17:55,026 --> 00:17:57,688
Without that book
I'm dead, okay?

268
00:17:59,664 --> 00:18:03,166
If it's not back
by 7:30, it's gonna
be my ass.

269
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:05,261
Oh, I promise.
I promise.

270
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:16,169
Got it?
Yeah.

271
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:33,126
Just a second.
I gotta lock up.

272
00:18:37,768 --> 00:18:39,134
Okay.

273
00:18:40,705 --> 00:18:43,367
God, can you wait
to get out of this
dump or what?

274
00:18:49,013 --> 00:18:51,881
Where you guys
going skiing again?
Sugarloaf or...

275
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:53,817
It's bush, Chas,
Sugarbush.

276
00:19:03,995 --> 00:19:05,695
That's my boys.

277
00:19:05,696 --> 00:19:07,731
What are you doin'?

278
00:19:07,732 --> 00:19:10,700
Keep your voice down!

279
00:19:10,701 --> 00:19:13,036
I'll tell you about it
in the morning.

280
00:19:15,673 --> 00:19:17,038
What...

281
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:19,609
Mrs. Hunsaker,
have a nice day?

282
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,378
George, why
all the noise?

283
00:19:23,047 --> 00:19:25,882
It's Hunsaker! Go! Go!

284
00:19:25,883 --> 00:19:28,051
I was just
messin' around with Chas.

285
00:19:28,052 --> 00:19:29,319
Good evening, Charles.

286
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,685
Hi, Mrs. Hunsaker.

287
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,622
What was that?
I don't know, ma'am.

288
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,397
Who were
those boys?

289
00:19:40,398 --> 00:19:42,195
Oh, who knows?
What were they doing?

290
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:44,128
Charles?

291
00:19:44,535 --> 00:19:45,869
Um...

292
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,937
Did you make this
scarf yourself?

293
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:49,539
No, George,
I bought it.

294
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,342
'Cause it's a beauty.
It really is.
Thank you, George.

295
00:19:52,343 --> 00:19:55,074
In case I don't
see you before
the Thanksgiving holidays,

296
00:19:55,513 --> 00:19:57,180
why don't you give me
one of your big hugs?

297
00:19:57,181 --> 00:19:58,682
Oh, George!
Please?

298
00:19:58,683 --> 00:20:00,183
Good evening, boys.
Come on.

299
00:20:00,184 --> 00:20:01,584
Goodbye,
Mrs. Hunsaker.

300
00:20:23,407 --> 00:20:26,309
Mr. Trask is our
fearless leader,

301
00:20:27,611 --> 00:20:30,672
a man of learning,
a voracious reader.

302
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:35,115
He could recite the lliad
in ancient Greek

303
00:20:36,253 --> 00:20:39,621
while fishing for trout
in a rippling creek.

304
00:20:40,925 --> 00:20:44,952
Endowed with wisdom,
of judgment sound,

305
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:49,466
nevertheless about him
the questions abound.

306
00:20:55,306 --> 00:20:58,867
How does Mr. Trask
make such wonderful deals?

307
00:20:59,443 --> 00:21:03,039
Why did the trustees
buy him Jaguar wheels?

308
00:21:04,048 --> 00:21:05,811
He wasn't conniving.

309
00:21:06,384 --> 00:21:08,485
He wasn't crass.

310
00:21:08,486 --> 00:21:10,852
He merely
puckered his lips

311
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:16,059
and kissed their ass!

312
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:35,812
Come on.

313
00:21:35,946 --> 00:21:37,380
Come on.

314
00:21:41,786 --> 00:21:42,986
One more.

315
00:21:42,987 --> 00:21:44,284
One more, come on!

316
00:22:04,075 --> 00:22:05,474
Fuck you!

317
00:22:12,316 --> 00:22:15,684
Mr. Simms, Mr. Willis.

318
00:22:16,353 --> 00:22:17,446
Hmm.

319
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:21,191
Mrs. Hunsaker says
that you gentlemen

320
00:22:21,192 --> 00:22:23,159
were at a vantage
point last night

321
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,596
to observe who was
responsible for this

322
00:22:27,631 --> 00:22:28,928
stunt.

323
00:22:34,872 --> 00:22:36,203
Who was it?

324
00:22:37,341 --> 00:22:39,366
I really couldn't
tell you, sir.

325
00:22:41,045 --> 00:22:44,147
I thought I saw
someone fooling
with the lamppost,

326
00:22:44,148 --> 00:22:48,585
but by the time
I pulled focus,
they were gone.

327
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,951
Mr. Simms?

328
00:22:52,756 --> 00:22:54,247
I couldn't say.

329
00:22:56,494 --> 00:23:00,563
That automobile
is not just a
possession of mine.

330
00:23:00,564 --> 00:23:05,502
That automobile was
presented to me by
the board of trustees.

331
00:23:05,503 --> 00:23:08,571
It is a symbol of
the standard of
excellence

332
00:23:08,572 --> 00:23:10,807
for which this
school is known,

333
00:23:10,808 --> 00:23:13,538
and I will not
have it tarnished.

334
00:23:14,578 --> 00:23:15,978
The automobile?

335
00:23:17,948 --> 00:23:20,076
The standard,
Mr. Willis.

336
00:23:23,621 --> 00:23:25,646
What's your position,
Mr. Simms?

337
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,891
On what, sir?

338
00:23:27,892 --> 00:23:30,156
On preserving the
reputation of Baird.

339
00:23:30,427 --> 00:23:32,157
I'm for Baird.

340
00:23:32,696 --> 00:23:34,164
Then, who did it?

341
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:37,627
I really
couldn't say for sure.

342
00:23:43,307 --> 00:23:44,832
Very well.

343
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:55,018
First thing Monday,
I'm convening
a special session

344
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:57,353
of the student-faculty
disciplinary committee.

345
00:23:57,354 --> 00:24:00,123
As this is a matter
which concerns
the whole school,

346
00:24:00,124 --> 00:24:03,026
the entire student body
will be present.

347
00:24:03,027 --> 00:24:05,662
There will be
no classes,
no activities.

348
00:24:05,663 --> 00:24:08,231
Nothing will
transpire at
this institution

349
00:24:08,232 --> 00:24:11,167
until that proceeding
is concluded.

350
00:24:13,404 --> 00:24:16,669
And if, at that time,
we are no further
along than we are now,

351
00:24:18,776 --> 00:24:20,573
I will expel you both.

352
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:28,544
Mr. Willis,
would you excuse us?

353
00:24:33,023 --> 00:24:34,616
Have a nice Thanksgiving.

354
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,127
Thank you.
You, too, Mr. Willis.

355
00:24:38,128 --> 00:24:39,425
I will.

356
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:48,834
Mr. Simms,

357
00:24:50,941 --> 00:24:53,137
I'm not quite through
with you yet.

358
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:04,754
One of the few perks
of this office is that

359
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:09,886
I am empowered to handle
certain matters on
my own as I see fit.

360
00:25:11,729 --> 00:25:13,463
Do you understand?

361
00:25:13,464 --> 00:25:15,022
Yes, sir.
Good.

362
00:25:15,499 --> 00:25:18,701
The Dean of
Admissions at Harvard
and I have an arrangement.

363
00:25:18,702 --> 00:25:22,071
Along with the usual
sheaf of applicants
submitted by Baird,

364
00:25:22,072 --> 00:25:24,140
of which virtually

365
00:25:24,141 --> 00:25:27,111
two-thirds are
guaranteed admittance,

366
00:25:27,911 --> 00:25:29,903
I add one name,

367
00:25:31,515 --> 00:25:35,110
somebody who's a standout
and yet underprivileged.

368
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:38,588
A student who
cannot afford to pay

369
00:25:38,589 --> 00:25:40,455
the board and
tuition in Cambridge.

370
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,621
Do you know on whose behalf
I drafted a memo this year?

371
00:25:47,831 --> 00:25:48,898
No, sir.

372
00:25:48,899 --> 00:25:50,128
You.

373
00:25:51,101 --> 00:25:52,660
You, Mr. Simms.

374
00:25:55,906 --> 00:25:58,136
Now can you tell me
who did it?

375
00:26:00,678 --> 00:26:02,168
No, sir, I can't.

376
00:26:03,547 --> 00:26:06,414
You take the weekend
to think about it, Mr. Simms.

377
00:26:08,886 --> 00:26:10,718
Good afternoon.

378
00:26:13,724 --> 00:26:15,214
What'd he say?

379
00:26:15,693 --> 00:26:17,894
Nothin'.
What do you
mean, nothing?

380
00:26:17,895 --> 00:26:19,429
He said the
same thing.

381
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,697
He just said
it over.

382
00:26:20,698 --> 00:26:22,432
You know what
he's doing?

383
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:25,163
He's good-cop,
bad-coppin' us.

384
00:26:25,736 --> 00:26:28,004
He knows I'm old guard.
You're fringe.

385
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:30,599
He's gonna bear down on me
and soft-soap you.

386
00:26:31,709 --> 00:26:34,844
Did he try to
soft-soap you?

387
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:36,006
Did he?

388
00:26:36,814 --> 00:26:37,906
No.

389
00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:42,285
Chas, I detect a slight
panic pulse from you.
Are you panicking?

390
00:26:42,286 --> 00:26:43,786
Yeah, a little.

391
00:26:43,787 --> 00:26:45,949
Come on.
You're on
scholarship, right?

392
00:26:47,157 --> 00:26:48,324
Yeah.

393
00:26:48,325 --> 00:26:51,420
You're on scholarship
from Oregon at Baird.

394
00:26:52,763 --> 00:26:54,959
You're a long way
from home, Chas.

395
00:26:55,632 --> 00:26:57,760
What's that got
to do with anything?

396
00:26:58,268 --> 00:27:00,670
I don't know how
it works out there.

397
00:27:00,671 --> 00:27:02,338
But how it
works here?

398
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:04,069
We stick together.

399
00:27:04,241 --> 00:27:06,709
It's us against them,
no matter what.

400
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,611
We don't cover our ass.

401
00:27:08,612 --> 00:27:10,713
We don't tell our parents.

402
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:12,409
Stonewall everybody!

403
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,418
And above all,

404
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:18,221
never, ever

405
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:21,351
leave any of us
twisting in the wind.

406
00:27:23,093 --> 00:27:24,861
And that's it.

407
00:27:24,862 --> 00:27:27,630
What does that have
to do with me being
on scholarship?

408
00:27:27,631 --> 00:27:29,565
Hey, hey.

409
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:32,331
I'm just tryin' to
bring you up to speed,
kid, that's it.

410
00:27:33,537 --> 00:27:34,868
Thanks.

411
00:27:38,008 --> 00:27:41,603
I'll tell you what.
Give me a few hours
to figure out the moves,

412
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:43,940
and call me tonight
in Vermont.

413
00:27:45,783 --> 00:27:49,018
I'll be at
the Sugarbush lodge,
all right?

414
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:50,180
All right.

415
00:27:51,655 --> 00:27:53,123
You all right?

416
00:27:54,324 --> 00:27:55,883
Yeah, I guess so.

417
00:27:57,394 --> 00:27:58,691
Okay.

418
00:28:01,298 --> 00:28:03,633
Try to keep him down
to four drinks a day.

419
00:28:03,634 --> 00:28:06,569
If you can keep
him down to 40,
you're doin' good.

420
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:09,205
We try to water
them down a little.
Do you know how to do that?

421
00:28:09,206 --> 00:28:11,174
It's a long ride,
honey.

422
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:13,810
Get the bags in the car.
I'll be right out.

423
00:28:13,811 --> 00:28:17,440
Mommy, Mommy,
don't forget
Uncle Frank's walk.

424
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:21,209
Oh, yeah.

425
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:26,285
You have to air him
out a little every day.

426
00:28:28,192 --> 00:28:30,860
Why don't you
go on back there,
get yourself oriented?

427
00:28:30,861 --> 00:28:33,922
I'll come out in a minute,
give you telephone
numbers and stuff.

428
00:28:35,866 --> 00:28:38,201
Well, I wouldn't
try a thing like that

429
00:28:38,202 --> 00:28:40,369
unless I knew, would I?

430
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,066
Just let me
speak to her.

431
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:44,507
Hello, beautiful.
Is that you?

432
00:28:44,508 --> 00:28:46,567
Yeah,
we spoke yesterday.

433
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,013
You have a glass
of wine with lunch?

434
00:28:51,014 --> 00:28:52,949
You sound
a little dusky. Hmm.

435
00:28:55,586 --> 00:28:57,486
Just a minute,
sweetheart.

436
00:28:59,122 --> 00:29:00,613
You're back, huh?

437
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:03,259
Tenacious!

438
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,329
Get out my dress blues.
They're in a garment bag
in the closet.

439
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,964
Check the
top dresser drawer.

440
00:29:07,965 --> 00:29:09,565
Take out
the shoulder boards

441
00:29:09,566 --> 00:29:11,434
and affix them,
shoulders
right and left,

442
00:29:11,435 --> 00:29:13,904
ASAP. That means now.

443
00:29:15,105 --> 00:29:16,706
Hello.

444
00:29:16,707 --> 00:29:19,642
Sorry to keep you
waiting, sweetheart.

445
00:29:19,643 --> 00:29:22,345
I'm not the kind of guy
who likes to rush things,

446
00:29:22,346 --> 00:29:25,314
but I'm catchin'
a 4:00 at Logan,
I'm lookin' out my window,

447
00:29:25,315 --> 00:29:27,079
and there's
not a taxi in sight.

448
00:29:28,318 --> 00:29:29,785
What happened
to Chet?

449
00:29:29,786 --> 00:29:31,584
He didn't invest
in a radio yet?

450
00:29:32,155 --> 00:29:35,125
Hah! Well,
get your driver on it.

451
00:29:36,593 --> 00:29:38,961
Tell him to get
a move on.

452
00:29:38,962 --> 00:29:41,488
Yes. Mmm.

453
00:29:42,666 --> 00:29:46,168
Some kind of body
has got to go with
that bedroom voice.

454
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:48,661
One day I'm gonna swing by,
get a better look at it.

455
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:50,466
You bet.

456
00:29:52,409 --> 00:29:53,672
Bye.

457
00:29:56,413 --> 00:29:58,548
My Valpak's
underneath the bed.

458
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:00,049
Get it out.

459
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,610
Put the boards
on the blues
and fold 'em in.

460
00:30:03,787 --> 00:30:06,355
Are we going
someplace, Colonel?

461
00:30:06,356 --> 00:30:08,017
What business is
that of yours?

462
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:10,960
Don't shrug, imbecile.
I'm blind.

463
00:30:10,961 --> 00:30:13,362
Save your body language
for the bimbi.

464
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:15,699
Now, get my gear out.

465
00:30:16,967 --> 00:30:19,333
Francine, get in the car.

466
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:23,536
It's almost 3:00.
The goddamn Flintstones
haven't left yet.

467
00:30:24,141 --> 00:30:27,201
Willie Rossi
must go in the car.

468
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:30,513
Here comes
Mrs. Rossi now.

469
00:30:30,514 --> 00:30:31,743
Damn it!

470
00:30:32,516 --> 00:30:34,678
She said goodbye to me
three times today.

471
00:30:36,053 --> 00:30:38,387
What has she got,
separation anxiety?

472
00:30:38,388 --> 00:30:40,220
Cut her off
at the door.

473
00:30:42,993 --> 00:30:44,722
Hi, honey.
Bye, honey.

474
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:50,926
I wish you were
coming with us.

475
00:30:51,535 --> 00:30:52,868
Me, too.

476
00:30:52,869 --> 00:30:54,235
Maybe next time.

477
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:00,443
Drive carefully now.

478
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:01,638
Yeah.

479
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,514
Charlie, this is
where we'll be.

480
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,886
Good luck, Charlie.
Don't let him
drink too much.

481
00:31:14,091 --> 00:31:15,615
See you, Charlie.

482
00:31:16,493 --> 00:31:19,224
And no 000 numbers.
He loves to talk dirty.

483
00:31:27,704 --> 00:31:29,764
All right,
let's get to work.

484
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:40,949
L- buckles
givin' you trouble?

485
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:45,254
Never in the
Boy Scouts, sluggo?

486
00:31:45,255 --> 00:31:47,023
I made Tenderfoot.

487
00:31:47,024 --> 00:31:48,958
Tenderfoot,
my foot!

488
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:51,257
Convenience store
mama's boy.

489
00:31:51,395 --> 00:31:53,295
Here. Let me
take a look
at that.

490
00:31:54,231 --> 00:31:57,633
Touch me again,
I'll kill you,
you little son of a bitch!

491
00:31:58,902 --> 00:32:00,393
I touch you.

492
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:03,803
Understand?

493
00:32:06,209 --> 00:32:10,271
My shoulder boards are
in the top dresser drawer.
Get them, son.

494
00:32:10,847 --> 00:32:12,838
The epaulets with
the silver oak leaf.

495
00:32:31,334 --> 00:32:33,035
Are these the...

496
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:34,834
Good.
Taxi come yet?

497
00:32:36,273 --> 00:32:38,741
Colonel,
where are we going?

498
00:32:38,742 --> 00:32:40,776
Where are we going?

499
00:32:40,777 --> 00:32:43,045
Freak show central.

500
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:45,015
Where's that?
New York City.

501
00:32:47,851 --> 00:32:49,418
That's in New York, son.

502
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:51,410
New York State.

503
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:54,457
Mrs. Rossi didn't say
anything to me
about going anywhere.

504
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:55,686
She forgot.

505
00:32:56,893 --> 00:32:58,594
Should we call her,
'cause I...

506
00:32:58,595 --> 00:33:00,262
You kidding me?

507
00:33:00,263 --> 00:33:02,398
Call her? By the time
they get to Albany

508
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,066
in that Hupmobile
he drives

509
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:06,297
it'll be opening day
at Saratoga.

510
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,704
Colonel, I can't go
to New York City.

511
00:33:08,705 --> 00:33:09,832
Why not?

512
00:33:11,141 --> 00:33:12,540
New York...

513
00:33:13,009 --> 00:33:14,944
New York's too
much responsibility.

514
00:33:14,945 --> 00:33:16,846
Ah, responsibility!

515
00:33:16,847 --> 00:33:19,648
I had a lot
of 17-year-olds
in my first platoon.

516
00:33:19,649 --> 00:33:21,879
I took care of them.
All set!

517
00:33:24,321 --> 00:33:25,584
How do I look?

518
00:33:27,524 --> 00:33:29,219
Tickets. Money.

519
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,088
Speech.

520
00:33:31,928 --> 00:33:35,262
Old Washington joke
from my days with Lyndon.

521
00:33:37,567 --> 00:33:39,635
I knew I could
count on transportation.

522
00:33:39,636 --> 00:33:40,967
Are you ready?

523
00:33:43,507 --> 00:33:46,067
This is not Panmunjom.
A simple yes will do.

524
00:33:47,177 --> 00:33:48,872
Um...
Good! Here you go.

525
00:33:49,246 --> 00:33:50,804
Come on!
Hop to, son!

526
00:33:52,215 --> 00:33:53,945
You're in front of me.
Let's go.

527
00:33:55,852 --> 00:33:57,650
Tomster,
come here, boy.

528
00:33:59,589 --> 00:34:00,856
Come on.

529
00:34:00,857 --> 00:34:02,892
Here, Tomster, come on.

530
00:34:02,893 --> 00:34:05,191
Tomster, Tomster. Yeah.

531
00:34:06,429 --> 00:34:09,524
Remember, when in doubt,

532
00:34:10,233 --> 00:34:11,360
fuck.

533
00:34:14,704 --> 00:34:17,139
Good afternoon, sir.
Where's our destination?

534
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,376
Our destination
New York City,
home of the brave!

535
00:34:20,377 --> 00:34:22,444
We got two for
the shuttle
to New York.

536
00:34:22,445 --> 00:34:25,481
I'm not shuttling anywhere.
Look at those tickets.
First class.

537
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:27,283
Yes, sir,
first class.

538
00:34:27,284 --> 00:34:29,351
Colonel,
you bought me
a ticket?

539
00:34:29,352 --> 00:34:31,120
I never said I'd
go to New York.

540
00:34:31,121 --> 00:34:33,155
What are you,
some kind of
chicken-shit,

541
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:35,157
sticks to job
description only?

542
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:37,092
Gate 46, sir.

543
00:34:37,093 --> 00:34:38,694
As you were, son.

544
00:34:38,695 --> 00:34:40,296
Thank you, sir.

545
00:34:40,297 --> 00:34:41,730
Which way's the door?

546
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:46,001
Are you blind?
Are you blind?

547
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:47,336
Of course not.

548
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:49,806
Then why do you keep grabbin'
my goddamn arm?

549
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,470
I take your arm.

550
00:34:57,013 --> 00:34:59,081
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.

551
00:34:59,082 --> 00:35:01,717
How would you know,
watchin' MTV all your life?

552
00:35:01,718 --> 00:35:03,812
Gentlemen?
Yeah!

553
00:35:06,423 --> 00:35:08,516
Jack Daniels.
You bet.

554
00:35:10,493 --> 00:35:12,394
And Diet Slice.

555
00:35:12,395 --> 00:35:13,729
The old Diet Slice.

556
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,197
And a water.

557
00:35:15,198 --> 00:35:17,394
Thank you,
Daphne.
Certainly, sir.

558
00:35:24,841 --> 00:35:26,901
Mmm!
How did you
know her name?

559
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:31,875
Well, she's
wearin' Floris.

560
00:35:32,816 --> 00:35:34,682
That's an
English cologne.

561
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:39,185
But her voice is
California chickie.

562
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:43,118
Now, California chickie
bucking for English lady.

563
00:35:43,927 --> 00:35:45,360
I call her Daphne.

564
00:35:47,597 --> 00:35:51,261
Oh, big things may
happen to that
little thing of yours.

565
00:35:53,503 --> 00:35:54,766
Look, Colonel,

566
00:35:56,606 --> 00:35:58,907
I'll get you to New York,
all right?
Uh-huh.

567
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:01,673
Then I'm gonna have
to turn around and come back.

568
00:36:02,245 --> 00:36:04,543
Well, Chuck,
you gotta do
what you gotta do.

569
00:36:05,548 --> 00:36:07,039
Charlie, all right?

570
00:36:07,584 --> 00:36:08,917
Or Charles.

571
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:11,287
Sorry.
I can't blame you, though.

572
00:36:11,288 --> 00:36:12,550
Chuck is a...

573
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:18,661
So, why are we
going to New York?

574
00:36:18,662 --> 00:36:22,223
All information will be given
on a need-to-know basis.

575
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:24,759
Hoo-ah!

576
00:36:25,568 --> 00:36:27,764
Where's Daphne?
Let's get her down here.

577
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,299
She's in the back.

578
00:36:33,009 --> 00:36:34,443
A tail's in the tail.

579
00:36:35,845 --> 00:36:37,006
Hah!

580
00:36:37,781 --> 00:36:39,381
Oh, but I still smell her.

581
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,480
Women.

582
00:36:45,889 --> 00:36:47,550
What can you say?

583
00:36:49,025 --> 00:36:50,516
Who made 'em?

584
00:36:51,728 --> 00:36:54,220
God must have been
a fuckin' genius.

585
00:36:58,601 --> 00:36:59,967
The hair...

586
00:37:01,304 --> 00:37:03,500
They say the hair
is everything, you know.

587
00:37:05,575 --> 00:37:09,307
Have you ever
buried your nose
in a mountain of curis

588
00:37:09,746 --> 00:37:12,875
and just wanted
to go to sleep forever?

589
00:37:14,617 --> 00:37:16,085
Or lips,

590
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:20,456
and when they touched,
yours were like

591
00:37:20,457 --> 00:37:23,620
that first swallow of wine

592
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,151
after you just crossed
the desert.

593
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,734
Tits!

594
00:37:31,735 --> 00:37:32,929
Hoo-ah.

595
00:37:33,937 --> 00:37:36,429
Big ones, little ones,

596
00:37:37,374 --> 00:37:39,775
nipples staring
right out at you

597
00:37:39,776 --> 00:37:41,904
like secret searchlights.

598
00:37:42,946 --> 00:37:44,175
Mmm.

599
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:47,978
And legs...

600
00:37:49,486 --> 00:37:52,478
I don't care if
they're Greek columns

601
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:54,722
or secondhand Steinways.

602
00:37:56,259 --> 00:37:57,659
What's between 'em,

603
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:01,421
passport to heaven.

604
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:04,892
I need a drink.

605
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:10,237
Yes, Mr. Simms,

606
00:38:12,242 --> 00:38:16,542
there's only two syllables
in this whole wide
world worth hearing.

607
00:38:22,118 --> 00:38:23,347
Pussy.

608
00:38:24,421 --> 00:38:25,718
Hah!

609
00:38:26,256 --> 00:38:29,158
Are you listening to me, son?
I'm givin' you pearis here.

610
00:38:31,094 --> 00:38:32,961
I guess you
really like women.

611
00:38:32,962 --> 00:38:35,488
Oh, above all things!

612
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:44,806
A very, very
distant second

613
00:38:46,843 --> 00:38:48,140
is a Ferrari.

614
00:38:56,019 --> 00:38:57,145
Charlie?

615
00:39:00,123 --> 00:39:01,420
Give me your hand.

616
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:06,527
This is just the start
of your education, son.

617
00:39:22,445 --> 00:39:23,640
Hoo-ah.

618
00:39:24,214 --> 00:39:25,681
Where are we?

619
00:39:25,682 --> 00:39:27,149
Where are we, eh?

620
00:39:27,717 --> 00:39:30,778
The cynosure of
all things civilized.

621
00:39:30,987 --> 00:39:32,887
The Waldorf-Astoria.

622
00:39:34,124 --> 00:39:37,693
The last time I
was here, Charlie,
was with a G-2 from Brussels.

623
00:39:37,694 --> 00:39:39,194
Had a Ferrari.

624
00:39:39,195 --> 00:39:42,564
Every day I
held the door open
for the fucker.

625
00:39:42,565 --> 00:39:44,833
Never even
offered me a ride.

626
00:39:44,834 --> 00:39:46,835
Well, fuck him.

627
00:39:46,836 --> 00:39:48,930
He's dead and I'm blind.

628
00:39:52,775 --> 00:39:54,343
Spread the word.

629
00:39:54,344 --> 00:39:55,577
Thank you, sir.

630
00:39:55,578 --> 00:39:57,613
And the intelligence
will be forthcoming?

631
00:39:57,614 --> 00:39:58,847
Sir?

632
00:39:58,848 --> 00:40:00,248
On the
escort scene.

633
00:40:00,917 --> 00:40:02,783
Yes, sir.

634
00:40:03,286 --> 00:40:05,320
And welcome to
the Waldorf.

635
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:06,653
Gracias, amigo.

636
00:40:08,491 --> 00:40:10,025
Puerto Ricans.

637
00:40:10,026 --> 00:40:11,858
Always made
the best infantrymen.

638
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:20,495
Oh!

639
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:28,771
I'm home again.

640
00:40:29,812 --> 00:40:31,974
Give me an inventory
on this, will you?

641
00:40:38,154 --> 00:40:40,289
All right, where am I,
in Asia?

642
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:43,492
He told me the phone
was on the other side
of the room, didn't he?

643
00:40:43,493 --> 00:40:44,858
By the windows?

644
00:40:46,396 --> 00:40:47,693
It's right here.

645
00:40:49,465 --> 00:40:50,797
Okay.

646
00:40:51,601 --> 00:40:52,864
We're in business.

647
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,172
Get me the Oak Room.

648
00:41:00,777 --> 00:41:02,939
How's that inventory
comin'?

649
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,915
There's Jim Beam

650
00:41:06,916 --> 00:41:09,484
and Early Times.

651
00:41:09,485 --> 00:41:11,317
Quartermaster's
on the take again.

652
00:41:11,754 --> 00:41:14,485
Hello. Is Sheldon
or Mack there?

653
00:41:16,225 --> 00:41:18,727
This is Lieutenant
Colonel Frank Slade.

654
00:41:18,728 --> 00:41:22,096
I used to be a regular.
I used to come in
with a General Garbisch.

655
00:41:24,267 --> 00:41:27,469
Yes, that's
probably because he's at
Arlington, six feet under.

656
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:30,963
Listen up.
I want a table for two,
and I don't mean Siberia,

657
00:41:31,441 --> 00:41:32,533
15.

658
00:41:33,843 --> 00:41:35,744
Clear them little
bottles off.

659
00:41:35,745 --> 00:41:39,581
And when I get
off the phone,
call up Hyman.

660
00:41:39,582 --> 00:41:42,518
Tell him I want it
wall to wall
with John Daniels.

661
00:41:43,052 --> 00:41:45,988
Don't you mean
Jack Daniels?

662
00:41:45,989 --> 00:41:49,858
He may be Jack to you, son.
But when you've known him
as long as I have...

663
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:51,326
That's a joke. Hello!

664
00:41:51,327 --> 00:41:54,429
This is Lieutenant
Colonel Frank Slade.
I would like a limo,

665
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,762
00.

666
00:42:02,772 --> 00:42:04,740
What are you drinkin'?

667
00:42:04,741 --> 00:42:07,976
Nothing, thanks.
I don't use it.

668
00:42:07,977 --> 00:42:09,809
What's useful about it?

669
00:42:11,381 --> 00:42:14,680
I don't know.
Listen, Colonel,
I have to get going.

670
00:42:15,585 --> 00:42:17,185
Where you goin'?

671
00:42:17,186 --> 00:42:19,121
Back to school.
I've got some real

672
00:42:19,122 --> 00:42:21,249
important stuff I
have to take care of.

673
00:42:22,158 --> 00:42:23,649
Very well.

674
00:42:24,661 --> 00:42:27,929
But I never let
my aides leave
on an empty stomach.

675
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:31,466
You'll dine with me
and then my driver
will transport you

676
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:34,528
to the airport for
the Boston shuttle
departing at 2200 hours.

677
00:42:36,105 --> 00:42:39,507
Meanwhile,
unpack my bag.

678
00:42:40,009 --> 00:42:41,636
I'm gonna christen
the latrine.

679
00:42:44,213 --> 00:42:46,148
What's your name,
driver?

680
00:42:46,149 --> 00:42:47,349
Manny, sir.

681
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:50,218
Manny. The bellhops
at the Waldorf,

682
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:52,387
are they any good
at getting escorts?

683
00:42:52,388 --> 00:42:54,456
I wouldn't know, sir.

684
00:42:54,457 --> 00:42:55,991
What would you know?

685
00:42:55,992 --> 00:42:57,893
About what?

686
00:42:57,894 --> 00:42:59,589
About you-know-what?

687
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:03,832
Maybe I could
manage something.

688
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:06,268
I'm talkin'
top of the line, now.

689
00:43:06,269 --> 00:43:07,998
Let me think
about this, sir.

690
00:43:16,713 --> 00:43:19,247
What's the matter
with you?

691
00:43:19,248 --> 00:43:20,549
With me?

692
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:23,251
Yeah. Car feels heavy.
You know why?

693
00:43:23,252 --> 00:43:26,120
You got the fuckin'
weight of the world
on your shoulders.

694
00:43:30,626 --> 00:43:32,928
I got a little problem
at school, that's all.

695
00:43:32,929 --> 00:43:34,296
Spit it out!

696
00:43:34,297 --> 00:43:35,964
It's not a big deal,
all right?

697
00:43:35,965 --> 00:43:38,033
Where we going,
the Oak Room
or somethin'?

698
00:43:38,034 --> 00:43:40,836
If it's not a big deal,
why did you say
real important stuff?

699
00:43:40,837 --> 00:43:43,004
What are you doin',
banging the dean's daughter?

700
00:43:43,005 --> 00:43:44,132
Hah!

701
00:43:46,342 --> 00:43:48,210
I'm just in
a little trouble.

702
00:43:48,211 --> 00:43:49,644
What kind of trouble?

703
00:43:50,379 --> 00:43:52,314
I saw some guys
doing something.

704
00:43:55,184 --> 00:43:58,586
To tell or not to tell,
or it's your ass.

705
00:43:59,188 --> 00:44:00,451
Hmm?

706
00:44:02,392 --> 00:44:03,658
How'd you know that?

707
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:06,288
I'm a wizard.
Give me the details,
come on.

708
00:44:12,568 --> 00:44:14,569
There's this guy
at school named Harry.

709
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:16,037
He's this
real rich kid,

710
00:44:16,038 --> 00:44:18,405
and he like,
runs the show.

711
00:44:19,208 --> 00:44:20,505
Who else?

712
00:44:22,011 --> 00:44:26,314
There's another guy, George,
but George didn't do anything.

713
00:44:26,315 --> 00:44:30,285
George and I saw
Harry and his buddies
doin' somethin'.

714
00:44:30,286 --> 00:44:32,420
Now, the folks at Baird,

715
00:44:32,421 --> 00:44:35,550
they know you and George
can identify
the guilty parties?

716
00:44:39,028 --> 00:44:40,629
Yeah, they think we can.

717
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:42,598
George is
a friend of yours.

718
00:44:43,733 --> 00:44:45,567
He's not a friend,
but he's all right.

719
00:44:45,568 --> 00:44:46,967
You trust him?

720
00:44:47,837 --> 00:44:49,066
Yeah, I guess so.

721
00:44:49,272 --> 00:44:51,672
He's on
scholarship, too?

722
00:44:52,809 --> 00:44:54,106
No, why?

723
00:44:54,443 --> 00:44:57,579
We got George,
we got Harry,
we got trouble.

724
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:00,482
They're rich, you're poor.
You wanna get rich.

725
00:45:00,483 --> 00:45:03,952
You wanna graduate Baird,
become a rich
big shot like them.

726
00:45:03,953 --> 00:45:05,453
Am I right?
No.

727
00:45:05,454 --> 00:45:07,252
It's not that
way at all.

728
00:45:07,857 --> 00:45:09,382
Okay, Charlie!

729
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,752
Here we are, gentlemen,
the Oak Room.

730
00:45:14,263 --> 00:45:15,822
The Oak Room!

731
00:45:16,365 --> 00:45:19,434
Bring us a menu and
double Jack Daniels
on the rocks.

732
00:45:19,435 --> 00:45:21,436
Charlie, sit down here.

733
00:45:21,437 --> 00:45:24,202
Perhaps you'll feel more
comfortable in this, sir.

734
00:45:29,245 --> 00:45:32,579
You look great!

735
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:38,847
Thank you.

736
00:45:39,989 --> 00:45:43,152
Here we are, Charlie,
the Oak Room.

737
00:45:43,926 --> 00:45:46,395
Now, read me
the bill of fare.

738
00:45:47,163 --> 00:45:48,687
Let's see.

739
00:45:49,131 --> 00:45:52,200
You got the Oak Room
burger and fries for $24.

740
00:45:52,201 --> 00:45:53,902
Where's the booze?

741
00:45:53,903 --> 00:45:55,537
Flowin' like
mud around here.

742
00:45:55,538 --> 00:45:57,006
A $24 hamburger?

743
00:45:58,541 --> 00:45:59,804
What's the story?

744
00:45:59,976 --> 00:46:01,443
What story?

745
00:46:02,845 --> 00:46:04,745
Are you a rich
miser or something?

746
00:46:05,181 --> 00:46:06,514
Hah!

747
00:46:06,515 --> 00:46:09,050
No, I'm just
your average blind man.

748
00:46:09,051 --> 00:46:10,781
Your average
blind man.

749
00:46:11,787 --> 00:46:14,518
How do you plan on paying
for all this stuff?

750
00:46:15,124 --> 00:46:17,024
Crisp, clean dollars.

751
00:46:17,393 --> 00:46:18,627
American.

752
00:46:18,628 --> 00:46:20,596
I saved up my
disability checks.

753
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:23,999
How much did you save?
I mean, we flew first class,

754
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,402
we're at the Waldorf-Astoria,
a $24 hamburger restaurant.

755
00:46:27,403 --> 00:46:29,337
All part of
a plan, Charlie.

756
00:46:29,772 --> 00:46:31,106
You want to let
me in on it?

757
00:46:31,107 --> 00:46:33,942
Why should I?
You're not interested.
You don't give a shit!

758
00:46:33,943 --> 00:46:38,380
You're leavin' on that
last shuttle
out of LaGuardia.

759
00:46:38,381 --> 00:46:40,144
Hmm? Ooh!

760
00:46:41,951 --> 00:46:44,784
You got 15 minutes, son.
I don't think
you're gonna make it.

761
00:46:45,554 --> 00:46:47,622
Unless the Oak Room
keeps some

762
00:46:47,623 --> 00:46:50,358
complimentary
helicopter on the roof.

763
00:46:50,359 --> 00:46:52,123
No, sir. No!

764
00:46:53,162 --> 00:46:55,096
You're here till tomorrow.

765
00:46:56,499 --> 00:46:58,900
You said the last shuttle
leaves at 2200 hours.

766
00:46:58,901 --> 00:47:00,835
That's 10:00, right?

767
00:47:01,637 --> 00:47:03,367
Last I heard, yeah.

768
00:47:04,073 --> 00:47:05,666
It's only ·:30.

769
00:47:06,108 --> 00:47:08,202
I lied. Leaves at 0:00.

770
00:47:08,911 --> 00:47:10,311
It leaves at 0:00?

771
00:47:10,479 --> 00:47:12,141
Calm down. Calm down.

772
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:17,485
Ahh! The truth is,
Charlie,

773
00:47:19,455 --> 00:47:23,050
I need a guide dog
to help me execute my plan.

774
00:47:23,292 --> 00:47:24,817
What plan?

775
00:47:26,228 --> 00:47:27,924
You have a right to know.

776
00:47:29,598 --> 00:47:32,363
It's not really a plan,
Charlie. It's sort of a...

777
00:47:32,935 --> 00:47:34,904
More like a tour,

778
00:47:35,504 --> 00:47:37,939
a little tour
of pleasures.

779
00:47:38,608 --> 00:47:42,339
Stay in a first-class hotel,
eat an agreeable meal,

780
00:47:43,145 --> 00:47:45,375
drink a nice
glass of wine,

781
00:47:46,983 --> 00:47:48,683
see my big brother.

782
00:47:48,684 --> 00:47:51,453
Nothing like family,
you know.

783
00:47:51,454 --> 00:47:55,413
And then, make love
to a terrific woman.

784
00:47:57,727 --> 00:47:59,160
After that...

785
00:48:05,101 --> 00:48:06,364
Yeah?

786
00:48:08,804 --> 00:48:13,264
I'm gonna lie down on
my big, beautiful bed
at the Waldorf

787
00:48:13,509 --> 00:48:15,170
and blow my brains out.

788
00:48:19,081 --> 00:48:20,915
May I tell you
our specials?

789
00:48:20,916 --> 00:48:22,407
You may, sir.

790
00:48:22,985 --> 00:48:24,953
Tonight we have
charred venison with

791
00:48:24,954 --> 00:48:27,389
buckwheat spaetzle
and green peppercorn.

792
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:31,126
Grilled veal paillards,
tomato tapenade,
and roasted eggplants.

793
00:48:31,127 --> 00:48:33,061
Get me a napkin.
My mouth's watering.

794
00:48:33,062 --> 00:48:35,363
If you would like our
cr·me souffl· for dessert,

795
00:48:35,364 --> 00:48:37,365
it would be a good
idea to order now.

796
00:48:37,366 --> 00:48:41,326
Yes, on the souffl·.
Give us a half a minute
on the rest.

797
00:48:41,704 --> 00:48:43,172
Very good, sir.

798
00:48:47,443 --> 00:48:49,377
I'm leaning
towards the spaetzle.

799
00:48:49,378 --> 00:48:52,781
Colonel Slade...
Charlie, rolls on the table?

800
00:48:52,782 --> 00:48:54,049
Give 'em to me.

801
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:56,351
You should
try these rolls, Charlie.

802
00:48:56,352 --> 00:48:59,954
I used to dream about them
when I was at Fort Huachuca.

803
00:48:59,955 --> 00:49:02,724
Colonel Slade...
Bread's no good
west of the Colorado.

804
00:49:02,725 --> 00:49:04,592
Water's too alkaline.

805
00:49:04,593 --> 00:49:07,358
Colonel Slade,
did you say...

806
00:49:07,763 --> 00:49:09,561
Did I hear you right?

807
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,732
You said you're gonna
kill yourself?

808
00:49:13,335 --> 00:49:14,703
No.

809
00:49:14,704 --> 00:49:16,672
I said I was gonna
blow my brains out.

810
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:20,041
Try one of these
rolls, Charlie.

811
00:49:20,042 --> 00:49:22,011
I buttered it for you.

812
00:49:22,678 --> 00:49:24,245
I don't want a roll,
all right?

813
00:49:24,246 --> 00:49:26,010
Okay. Have a radish!

814
00:49:26,916 --> 00:49:28,213
Hah!

815
00:49:29,618 --> 00:49:33,788
Hello! Bring me
a double Jack Daniels
on the rocks.

816
00:49:33,789 --> 00:49:35,086
Yes, sir.
Right away.

817
00:49:39,228 --> 00:49:41,595
Please, don't do that.

818
00:49:42,798 --> 00:49:44,357
Don't do that.

819
00:49:51,006 --> 00:49:52,133
Hmm.

820
00:49:55,478 --> 00:49:57,275
What a marvelous place.

821
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:02,381
Okay.

822
00:50:06,388 --> 00:50:08,323
Yeah.

823
00:50:09,625 --> 00:50:11,684
Your billet is here.

824
00:50:12,261 --> 00:50:15,253
You'll find bedding
in the closet on the shelf.

825
00:50:16,298 --> 00:50:18,500
In the morning,
the area will be

826
00:50:18,501 --> 00:50:20,401
returned to
sitting-room mode

827
00:50:20,402 --> 00:50:22,701
no later than
0700 hours.

828
00:50:26,809 --> 00:50:28,174
What was that?

829
00:50:30,846 --> 00:50:32,075
Nothing.

830
00:50:33,149 --> 00:50:36,141
Next time
snap it out!

831
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:42,687
Thumb to palm, index finger
through little digit,
smartly aligned,

832
00:50:44,026 --> 00:50:46,620
sharp to the hairline,
down!

833
00:50:51,233 --> 00:50:53,668
Too many men,
far better than you,

834
00:50:53,669 --> 00:50:55,637
have executed
that courtesy.

835
00:50:56,305 --> 00:50:59,400
And if you're smart,
you won't try it again.

836
00:51:03,546 --> 00:51:07,915
This bat has
got sharper radar
than the Nautilus.

837
00:51:08,417 --> 00:51:10,886
Don't fuck with me,
Charlie.

838
00:51:21,997 --> 00:51:24,489
See you get
a good night's
sleep, son.

839
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:39,380
It's a lovely day today

840
00:51:39,381 --> 00:51:42,317
So, whatever you gotta do

841
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:45,549
You got a lovely day
to do it in, that's true

842
00:51:52,061 --> 00:51:54,052
Good morning, Charlie.

843
00:51:56,365 --> 00:51:58,094
Good morning.

844
00:51:58,434 --> 00:52:00,301
This is Sofia, Charlie.

845
00:52:00,302 --> 00:52:02,670
She's a magician
with a needle.

846
00:52:02,671 --> 00:52:05,773
Sofia's workin' me up
a little Glen Plaid number,

847
00:52:05,774 --> 00:52:08,437
and I've asked her if
she'd put something
together for you.

848
00:52:09,044 --> 00:52:11,346
I don't need
any clothes, Colonel.

849
00:52:11,347 --> 00:52:14,407
Standard issue
for an upscale
urban assignment.

850
00:52:14,717 --> 00:52:17,385
You don't like the clothes,
Charlie,
on completion of duty,

851
00:52:17,386 --> 00:52:19,411
you can give 'em away.

852
00:52:19,722 --> 00:52:23,157
Juice, coffee,
and other assorted goodies
on the trolley over there.

853
00:52:23,158 --> 00:52:25,388
Get yourself up,
get yourself together.

854
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:29,664
It's a great day
for singin' a song

855
00:52:29,665 --> 00:52:33,101
And it's a great day
for movin' along

856
00:52:33,102 --> 00:52:35,770
And it's a great day
from morning to night

857
00:52:35,771 --> 00:52:37,762
And it's a great day

858
00:52:39,208 --> 00:52:40,937
For everybody's plight

859
00:52:47,449 --> 00:52:49,417
How are you feeling
today, Colonel?

860
00:52:49,418 --> 00:52:50,785
Super!

861
00:52:50,786 --> 00:52:52,420
Superior!

862
00:52:52,421 --> 00:52:54,014
Superfluous!

863
00:52:55,424 --> 00:52:57,756
Young Sofie here
is working Thanksgiving

864
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,428
because she's trying to
put herself through college.

865
00:53:00,429 --> 00:53:03,564
I told her, "My young friend
Charlie's headed for college."

866
00:53:03,565 --> 00:53:05,166
Excuse me.

867
00:53:05,167 --> 00:53:06,467
Where you goin'?

868
00:53:06,468 --> 00:53:08,169
I need to use
the phone.

869
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:10,400
What's wrong with
the phones in here?

870
00:53:10,939 --> 00:53:12,640
I don't want
to disturb you.

871
00:53:12,641 --> 00:53:15,201
You're not disturbing me.
Make your call.

872
00:53:15,844 --> 00:53:17,045
I'd kind of like
to be private.

873
00:53:17,046 --> 00:53:18,707
Stay out of my room!

874
00:53:19,949 --> 00:53:22,008
This is as private
as you're gonna get.

875
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:29,148
But if
you've got somethin'
that must be done

876
00:53:29,958 --> 00:53:33,395
And it can only
be done by one

877
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:36,459
Sofia,

878
00:53:38,033 --> 00:53:40,525
what are the chances
of suitin' you
up sometime?

879
00:53:42,204 --> 00:53:45,231
Sugarbush Lodge.
George Willis, please.

880
00:53:48,043 --> 00:53:49,243
Hello.

881
00:53:49,244 --> 00:53:50,837
George! Hey, it's Charlie.

882
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:54,543
Hey, Chas.
Next year you gotta
come up with us.

883
00:53:54,984 --> 00:53:57,919
White powder on
a base of snow bunnies.

884
00:53:59,555 --> 00:54:01,648
Chas, are you there?

885
00:54:02,257 --> 00:54:04,092
Yeah, I'm here.

886
00:54:04,093 --> 00:54:06,527
You told me to call
you for the moves.

887
00:54:06,528 --> 00:54:07,862
All right.

888
00:54:07,863 --> 00:54:11,265
For now, the move's
no move, status quo.

889
00:54:11,266 --> 00:54:13,067
Everything's
the way we left it.

890
00:54:13,068 --> 00:54:14,536
How did we leave it?

891
00:54:15,371 --> 00:54:18,363
See no evil,
hear no eviI.

892
00:54:19,608 --> 00:54:21,576
You know
what I mean, Chas?

893
00:54:22,945 --> 00:54:25,812
Yeah. See no evil,
hear no evil.

894
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:30,351
Okay, then,
walk like you talk.

895
00:54:30,352 --> 00:54:32,582
All right, bye.

896
00:54:33,522 --> 00:54:35,320
George Willis, huh?

897
00:54:36,325 --> 00:54:37,485
Yeah.

898
00:54:38,227 --> 00:54:39,794
George Willis.

899
00:54:39,795 --> 00:54:43,060
That makes his
father probably
George Willis, Senior.

900
00:54:44,133 --> 00:54:46,134
Charlie, I ask you,

901
00:54:46,135 --> 00:54:50,138
what do you think
big George is gonna feel
about little George

902
00:54:50,139 --> 00:54:53,199
seeing no evil,
hearing no evil?

903
00:54:55,744 --> 00:54:57,872
Well, we're not gonna
tell our parents.

904
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,981
We're just gonna keep it
between ourselves.

905
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:04,517
Oh, George isn't gonna tell
his father about this thing!

906
00:55:05,287 --> 00:55:06,521
Damn decent of him.

907
00:55:08,257 --> 00:55:10,391
Scusi, Colonnello.
Prego.

908
00:55:10,392 --> 00:55:12,156
I love it
when you hurt me.

909
00:55:13,729 --> 00:55:15,596
Tell me now,
Charlie.

910
00:55:15,597 --> 00:55:19,557
This George Willis, Jr.,
what's his father do?

911
00:55:20,536 --> 00:55:22,103
I don't really know.

912
00:55:22,104 --> 00:55:23,936
Well, I'm gonna tell you.

913
00:55:24,306 --> 00:55:26,174
When George Willis, Senior,

914
00:55:26,175 --> 00:55:28,976
isn't busy as
a million-dollar man
for Aetna Casualty...

915
00:55:28,977 --> 00:55:31,212
Or is it
New England distributor

916
00:55:31,213 --> 00:55:32,847
for the Chrysler
Corporation?

917
00:55:32,848 --> 00:55:36,842
He concerns himself
with his young son,
George Willis, Jr.

918
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:40,288
George isn't going
to say anything
to his father.

919
00:55:40,289 --> 00:55:42,052
Oh, Charlie.

920
00:55:42,491 --> 00:55:44,826
Big George is gonna
wind up little George,

921
00:55:44,827 --> 00:55:47,929
and little George
is gonna sing
like a canary.

922
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:50,421
And if you're hip, kid,
you're gonna hop to, too.

923
00:55:50,833 --> 00:55:53,034
You've got this
all figured out,
don't you?

924
00:55:53,035 --> 00:55:55,336
It don't take no
Young American merit

925
00:55:55,337 --> 00:55:57,238
scholarship to
figure this one out.

926
00:55:57,239 --> 00:55:59,340
Charlie,
you had a little life,

927
00:55:59,341 --> 00:56:01,442
so you decided
to go to the
Baird school

928
00:56:01,443 --> 00:56:03,810
to put yourself
in the market
for a big one.

929
00:56:04,213 --> 00:56:06,180
Now, in order to stay
in the running,

930
00:56:06,181 --> 00:56:09,242
you're gonna have
to tell these people
what they want to know.

931
00:56:10,552 --> 00:56:11,886
You think so?

932
00:56:11,887 --> 00:56:13,354
Are we finished, Sofia?

933
00:56:13,355 --> 00:56:15,016
Yes.
Grazie. Grazie.
Andate.

934
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,684
Charlie,

935
00:56:20,863 --> 00:56:23,093
if you don't sing now,

936
00:56:23,765 --> 00:56:27,201
you're gonna end up,
not only shelving biscuits

937
00:56:27,202 --> 00:56:30,238
in some convenience store
in the Oregon 'burbs,

938
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:33,174
but probably the last
word you'll ever hear
yourself say

939
00:56:33,175 --> 00:56:35,476
just before you croak,
gonna be,

940
00:56:35,477 --> 00:56:39,347
"Have a nice day
and come back soon."

941
00:56:39,348 --> 00:56:41,249
Sofia!

942
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:43,117
Measure up
Charlie, here, pronto.

943
00:56:43,118 --> 00:56:45,052
We got a date
for Thanksgiving.

944
00:56:45,721 --> 00:56:46,984
We got a date?

945
00:56:47,256 --> 00:56:49,087
My brother's place.

946
00:56:49,224 --> 00:56:52,387
W.R. Slade,
White Plains, New York.

947
00:56:53,061 --> 00:56:55,462
Colonel, I can't go with you
to your brother's place.

948
00:56:55,597 --> 00:56:58,590
I mean, I should be
getting back to school.

949
00:57:01,503 --> 00:57:05,273
Well, you gotta have
Thanksgiving somewhere.

950
00:57:05,274 --> 00:57:07,441
I mean, eats and treats.

951
00:57:07,442 --> 00:57:09,274
I can use
the company, Charlie.

952
00:57:12,781 --> 00:57:14,248
All right.

953
00:57:14,249 --> 00:57:15,816
Does he know
I'm comin'?

954
00:57:15,817 --> 00:57:17,285
He doesn't know
I'm comin'.

955
00:57:17,286 --> 00:57:19,387
But wait till you see
the look on his face

956
00:57:19,388 --> 00:57:20,788
when I walk
through the door.

957
00:57:20,789 --> 00:57:22,348
Oh, he loves me!

958
00:57:24,626 --> 00:57:28,596
Oh, Charlie,
about your
little problem,

959
00:57:28,597 --> 00:57:31,265
there are two kinds
of people in this world:

960
00:57:31,266 --> 00:57:33,668
Those who stand up
and face the music,

961
00:57:33,669 --> 00:57:35,570
and those who
run for cover.

962
00:57:35,571 --> 00:57:37,205
Cover's better.

963
00:57:37,206 --> 00:57:39,407
Okay, Sofia, suit him up!

964
00:57:39,408 --> 00:57:41,035
Make him pretty.

965
00:57:57,492 --> 00:57:59,085
Careful.

966
00:58:00,395 --> 00:58:01,761
Should I ring it?
Yeah.

967
00:58:11,173 --> 00:58:13,437
Yes?
Yes!

968
00:58:13,609 --> 00:58:15,008
Who is this?

969
00:58:15,377 --> 00:58:16,867
It's Randy.

970
00:58:17,045 --> 00:58:18,877
Randy? You new?

971
00:58:19,948 --> 00:58:21,415
I'm your nephew.

972
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:23,851
Hah! Here I am!

973
00:58:24,086 --> 00:58:25,987
Your sister's been
hoarding me
long enough.

974
00:58:25,988 --> 00:58:28,957
Thought it's time
to spread the
riches around.

975
00:58:29,391 --> 00:58:31,726
Uncle Frank.
Gloria!

976
00:58:31,727 --> 00:58:33,695
Gail.
Of course.

977
00:58:34,496 --> 00:58:37,398
Say hello to the potluck
party from New York City.

978
00:58:37,399 --> 00:58:40,868
Good old Uncle
Frank and this here
with him is Charlie Simms,

979
00:58:40,869 --> 00:58:43,771
star halfback of the
Baird football team.

980
00:58:43,772 --> 00:58:47,640
They not only beat
Exeter and Groton,
but Aquinas High School, too.

981
00:58:48,577 --> 00:58:50,411
Where's your
miserable father?

982
00:58:50,412 --> 00:58:52,747
Wait! No, no.
Let's surprise him.

983
00:58:52,748 --> 00:58:56,343
Give that fat
heart of his
an attack. Willie!

984
00:58:58,353 --> 00:58:59,821
Ho, Willie!

985
00:59:13,035 --> 00:59:14,525
Hello, Frank.

986
00:59:15,103 --> 00:59:17,405
How you doin'?
Okay.

987
00:59:17,406 --> 00:59:18,805
Here's my hand.

988
00:59:20,442 --> 00:59:22,672
Charlie, meet
W.R. Slade.

989
00:59:22,844 --> 00:59:24,211
Nice to meet you, sir.

990
00:59:24,212 --> 00:59:27,048
The original
bulging briefcase man.

991
00:59:27,049 --> 00:59:29,917
Gretchen, I smell
those prunes!

992
00:59:29,918 --> 00:59:32,053
We talkin'
turkey Marbella?
Yes, we are.

993
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:36,957
Let's have a whiff.
Come on.

994
00:59:36,958 --> 00:59:38,926
You know, I always
had a sneaker for you.
Come here.

995
00:59:43,198 --> 00:59:45,599
Where are you, Garry?
I heard you cough.
Right here.

996
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,193
Who are you again?

997
00:59:47,469 --> 00:59:52,273
I'm here at
the Waldorf with...
Is it your brother?

998
00:59:52,274 --> 00:59:54,842
W.R.'s final issue.
How ya doin', son?

999
00:59:54,843 --> 00:59:57,335
Yeah, sure,
Frank's my brother.
Who the hell are you?

1000
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,181
I'm takin' care of him
for the weekend.

1001
01:00:00,182 --> 01:00:01,342
Charlie.

1002
01:00:03,385 --> 01:00:04,375
Sorry.

1003
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:06,579
Where's the booze?

1004
01:00:07,022 --> 01:00:08,289
Flowin' like mud here.

1005
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:11,919
To tell the truth,
the Colonel's not well,
I don't think.

1006
01:00:12,394 --> 01:00:13,623
Not well?

1007
01:00:13,995 --> 01:00:15,987
I think he's
a little lonely.

1008
01:00:16,565 --> 01:00:18,799
Why didn't you
take him to your
family's for dinner?

1009
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,291
I heard that!

1010
01:00:22,204 --> 01:00:23,704
I heard that.

1011
01:00:23,705 --> 01:00:26,941
Pay no attention
to him, Charlie.
That's just big-brother talk.

1012
01:00:26,942 --> 01:00:29,643
He's been watching out
for me since day one.

1013
01:00:29,644 --> 01:00:33,445
Bailed me out of more trouble
than he'd like to remember.

1014
01:00:34,649 --> 01:00:36,515
Here, let me
take your coat.

1015
01:00:37,619 --> 01:00:40,855
I meant to pick up
some vino on my way up,
but I blew it.

1016
01:00:40,856 --> 01:00:43,457
I'll send you the
Rothschild again
for Christmas,

1017
01:00:43,458 --> 01:00:45,926
only let's see how
Thanksgiving goes.

1018
01:00:45,927 --> 01:00:47,428
I'll set two
more places.

1019
01:00:47,429 --> 01:00:48,896
Here's
your drink, Frank.

1020
01:00:48,897 --> 01:00:50,765
Thank you, Randy.

1021
01:00:50,766 --> 01:00:52,961
Still with
Snow Queen Sugar?

1022
01:00:53,568 --> 01:00:57,130
Snow Flake.
Why do you always
get that wrong?

1023
01:00:57,506 --> 01:00:59,607
Because it's not
important for me
to get it right.

1024
01:00:59,608 --> 01:01:01,235
What are you doing
there now?

1025
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:03,810
I'm vice president
for marketing.

1026
01:01:04,012 --> 01:01:05,980
Hoo-ah!
Congratulations!

1027
01:01:06,882 --> 01:01:08,382
Sugar is shit, though.

1028
01:01:08,383 --> 01:01:11,652
I told General Abrams,
install honey in
the commissaries.

1029
01:01:11,653 --> 01:01:13,654
If K-50s didn't
blow your brains out,

1030
01:01:13,655 --> 01:01:15,456
sugar, sure as shit,
was gonna.

1031
01:01:16,758 --> 01:01:18,959
Why don't we
all sit down?
Ooh.

1032
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,830
Mitsouki. Rhymes
with nookie.
Be careful.

1033
01:01:22,831 --> 01:01:25,666
When the wife
gets restless,
the wife gets racy.

1034
01:01:25,667 --> 01:01:27,334
Well, let's
go and eat,
shall we?

1035
01:01:27,335 --> 01:01:28,769
By all means.

1036
01:01:30,338 --> 01:01:32,072
Thank you, Charlie.

1037
01:01:32,073 --> 01:01:36,243
Where you
wanna sit, Frank?
At the head again?

1038
01:01:36,244 --> 01:01:40,010
Any old card table
will do. This is fine.

1039
01:01:41,917 --> 01:01:43,384
Where was I?

1040
01:01:43,385 --> 01:01:46,687
So, I wake up.
It's 4:00 in the morning.
I don't know who I'm with

1041
01:01:46,688 --> 01:01:49,055
or why I'm there,
or where I am.

1042
01:01:49,624 --> 01:01:52,492
What am I gonna do?
I got this Asian flower

1043
01:01:52,961 --> 01:01:56,898
on one hand,
all giggly and dewy-like,

1044
01:01:57,299 --> 01:02:01,368
and this hard-boiled
Navy nurse outta Omaha,
on the other.

1045
01:02:01,369 --> 01:02:05,135
We're three across
the bed, not a stitch
of clothes on.

1046
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,006
It comes to me.

1047
01:02:08,076 --> 01:02:12,411
Let east meet west.
We'll build a
golden bridge.

1048
01:02:14,483 --> 01:02:17,475
I felt like I'd just joined
the corps of engineers!

1049
01:02:23,592 --> 01:02:25,253
We all still here?

1050
01:02:26,194 --> 01:02:28,185
It's a
beautiful story.

1051
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:34,401
Do you always enjoy
shocking people,
Uncle Frank?

1052
01:02:34,402 --> 01:02:35,569
Honey...

1053
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:38,072
I didn't know
you were so
easily shocked, Randy.

1054
01:02:38,073 --> 01:02:40,374
I admire your
sensibilities,
I'm touched.

1055
01:02:40,375 --> 01:02:43,444
Dad, remember the time
you persuaded Frank

1056
01:02:43,445 --> 01:02:45,613
to go to the kennel?

1057
01:02:45,614 --> 01:02:46,747
What about it?

1058
01:02:46,748 --> 01:02:49,083
He almost put
the seeing eye dog business
outta business.

1059
01:02:49,084 --> 01:02:50,351
Cool it, Randy.

1060
01:02:50,352 --> 01:02:52,218
It's over and done with.

1061
01:02:52,654 --> 01:02:54,588
Indeed it is, Garry.

1062
01:02:54,589 --> 01:02:56,790
Indeed it is.
So is dinner.

1063
01:02:56,791 --> 01:02:58,459
Charlie, what time
you have?

1064
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:00,027
I think we better
be gettin' back.

1065
01:03:00,028 --> 01:03:03,197
You ever given
any thought to
a Braille watch, Frank?

1066
01:03:03,198 --> 01:03:04,298
Randy...

1067
01:03:04,299 --> 01:03:07,902
Stevie Wonder wears one,
or do you rank on him, too?

1068
01:03:07,903 --> 01:03:09,103
Honey, please.

1069
01:03:09,104 --> 01:03:11,505
It's all right, Gloria.
I enjoy Randy's
observations.

1070
01:03:11,506 --> 01:03:13,634
My wife's name
is Gail, Frank.

1071
01:03:14,075 --> 01:03:15,676
Can you hear that?
Gail.

1072
01:03:15,677 --> 01:03:17,975
Excuse me.
Gail.

1073
01:03:18,713 --> 01:03:21,682
Gail strikes me as
a very beautiful woman,

1074
01:03:21,683 --> 01:03:24,518
but, you know,
there's a little
tension in her voice.

1075
01:03:24,519 --> 01:03:27,354
I don't know what it is.
It could be one
of two things,

1076
01:03:27,355 --> 01:03:29,984
either Gail is nervous
or unsatisfied.

1077
01:03:32,227 --> 01:03:33,894
What's your point,
Uncle Frank?

1078
01:03:33,895 --> 01:03:35,429
You ought to
go down on her.

1079
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:37,765
Cut it out, Frank,
will ya?

1080
01:03:37,766 --> 01:03:39,800
You've gotten
so wrapped up
in sugar,

1081
01:03:39,801 --> 01:03:42,002
you forgotten
the taste of
real honey!

1082
01:03:42,003 --> 01:03:43,537
Frank, for
God's sake!

1083
01:03:43,538 --> 01:03:44,705
Hear that voice?

1084
01:03:44,706 --> 01:03:46,340
There's fire
under that dress.

1085
01:03:46,341 --> 01:03:48,542
Will you cut it out?
Just get the fuck
outta here.

1086
01:03:48,543 --> 01:03:50,578
Hoo-ah!
Get in your limousine.

1087
01:03:50,579 --> 01:03:54,715
Go down to the Bowery.
Get with the other fucking
drunks, where you belong!

1088
01:03:54,716 --> 01:03:55,883
Wait a minute.

1089
01:03:55,884 --> 01:03:57,751
What?
Can you take it easy?

1090
01:03:57,752 --> 01:03:58,919
What for?

1091
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:02,413
You want me to lay off him,
Chucky, 'cause he's blind?

1092
01:04:02,958 --> 01:04:04,024
No, but...

1093
01:04:04,025 --> 01:04:06,093
My friend's name is Charles.

1094
01:04:06,094 --> 01:04:08,095
He doesn't like to
be called Chucky.

1095
01:04:08,096 --> 01:04:10,564
This is supposed to be
a family get-together.

1096
01:04:10,565 --> 01:04:11,966
Just a warning.

1097
01:04:11,967 --> 01:04:15,836
Jesus Christ,
another sucker who thinks
this shit-heel's a war hero.

1098
01:04:15,837 --> 01:04:16,998
Hoo-ah!

1099
01:04:19,474 --> 01:04:22,102
Well, once, maybe.

1100
01:04:23,278 --> 01:04:26,614
I suppose he told
you about his days on
Lyndon Johnson's staff?

1101
01:04:26,615 --> 01:04:28,879
I was gonna go.
Now I'm not leaving.

1102
01:04:29,918 --> 01:04:32,148
Frank was earmarked
for general.

1103
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:34,318
Earmarked, good word.

1104
01:04:34,622 --> 01:04:36,857
Frank likes to spit
in everybody's eye!

1105
01:04:36,858 --> 01:04:38,192
Randy, that's enough.

1106
01:04:38,193 --> 01:04:42,630
So they, what do they call it,
when they give you the
shaft in the military?

1107
01:04:42,631 --> 01:04:43,998
Passed over!

1108
01:04:43,999 --> 01:04:46,934
Right, Frank was
passed over
for promotion.

1109
01:04:47,702 --> 01:04:49,136
Couple times.

1110
01:04:53,308 --> 01:04:54,508
You wanna know
what happened then?

1111
01:04:54,509 --> 01:04:56,043
Will you shut
your mouth?

1112
01:04:56,044 --> 01:04:57,478
He blew himself up.

1113
01:04:57,479 --> 01:04:58,979
Stop it, Randy.

1114
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:02,216
Our Colonel here had
a grenade juggling act

1115
01:05:02,217 --> 01:05:04,752
at Fort Bragg, or wherever
it was they dumped him.

1116
01:05:04,753 --> 01:05:05,819
Fort Benning.

1117
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:08,722
He was teaching
hand-to-hand combat
to second lieutenants...

1118
01:05:08,723 --> 01:05:11,291
Randy, look at me when
you're talking to me,
now, son.

1119
01:05:11,292 --> 01:05:15,629
I'm lookin', Frank.
His partner in the act
was some captain.

1120
01:05:15,630 --> 01:05:17,231
Major Vincent Squires.

1121
01:05:17,232 --> 01:05:18,499
Whoever he was.

1122
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:21,268
Before going on, they'd
have a lo-cal breakfast,

1123
01:05:21,269 --> 01:05:24,138
a screwdriver for Frank,
bloody mary for his partner.

1124
01:05:24,139 --> 01:05:25,973
No, Vincent drank
Sea Breezes.

1125
01:05:25,974 --> 01:05:27,808
The Judge Advocate
at Benning said

1126
01:05:27,809 --> 01:05:31,879
Colonel Slade had four
to his partner's one.

1127
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:34,882
He's really
flying in class.
He gets all excited.

1128
01:05:34,883 --> 01:05:37,215
He starts pulling
the pins out.

1129
01:05:39,687 --> 01:05:41,952
One grenade got
away from him.

1130
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:43,382
Boom.

1131
01:05:46,227 --> 01:05:48,028
The one that got away.

1132
01:05:48,029 --> 01:05:50,657
The pin was in,
Frank claims.

1133
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,334
In or out, what
difference does it make?

1134
01:05:54,335 --> 01:05:57,203
What kind of
fucking lunatic
juggles grenades?

1135
01:05:57,906 --> 01:05:59,239
Vinnie came out okay.

1136
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,470
All Frank lost
was his eyesight.

1137
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,047
You wanna know
the truth?

1138
01:06:07,048 --> 01:06:08,649
Got a handle
on that, do you?

1139
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:10,117
He was
an asshole before.

1140
01:06:10,118 --> 01:06:11,313
Hoo-ah!

1141
01:06:13,088 --> 01:06:15,656
Now all he is,
is a blind asshole.

1142
01:06:15,657 --> 01:06:16,886
Hoo-ah.

1143
01:06:23,264 --> 01:06:25,824
Hey, God's a funny guy.

1144
01:06:28,136 --> 01:06:30,264
God doth have
a sense of humor.

1145
01:06:33,074 --> 01:06:36,374
Maybe God thinks
some people don't
deserve to see.

1146
01:06:37,579 --> 01:06:38,876
Hoo-ah.

1147
01:06:43,418 --> 01:06:45,750
You get
the point, Chucky?

1148
01:06:50,725 --> 01:06:52,489
His name is Charles.

1149
01:06:53,161 --> 01:06:55,329
You can say that,
can't you? Charles.

1150
01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:57,865
Know what this is, Randy?
It's a Ranger choke hold.

1151
01:06:57,866 --> 01:07:00,300
From teaching
those lieutenants.
Colonel, let go.

1152
01:07:00,301 --> 01:07:02,769
Little pressure,
I bust your windpipe.

1153
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:04,605
I don't care
what he said to me.
After me.

1154
01:07:04,606 --> 01:07:05,839
Charles.

1155
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,608
Just let go, please!

1156
01:07:27,295 --> 01:07:28,785
Gretchen?

1157
01:07:30,198 --> 01:07:32,098
You outdid yourself.

1158
01:07:33,968 --> 01:07:36,370
If you twist my
arm hard enough,

1159
01:07:36,371 --> 01:07:38,897
we're talking
turkey Marbella
next year.

1160
01:07:39,307 --> 01:07:40,797
Who knows?

1161
01:07:47,315 --> 01:07:48,510
Frank?

1162
01:07:49,717 --> 01:07:51,481
Goodbye, Willie.

1163
01:07:56,124 --> 01:07:57,853
I'm no fucking good.

1164
01:08:00,295 --> 01:08:02,195
And I never have been.

1165
01:08:08,236 --> 01:08:10,568
Come on, Charlie,
get the coats.

1166
01:08:16,945 --> 01:08:19,345
Colonel.
Watch your step.

1167
01:08:22,016 --> 01:08:23,348
Hold it.

1168
01:08:37,332 --> 01:08:41,029
Nueva York,
compadre. Vamos!

1169
01:09:25,947 --> 01:09:27,574
You got a watch?

1170
01:09:31,386 --> 01:09:32,717
It's 7:20.

1171
01:09:33,821 --> 01:09:36,984
I didn't ask you the time.
I asked if you had a watch.

1172
01:09:37,926 --> 01:09:39,493
Yeah, in the other room.

1173
01:09:39,494 --> 01:09:40,688
Get it.

1174
01:09:45,033 --> 01:09:48,059
Colonel, there's a clock
right next to your bed.

1175
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:51,361
Does it have
a second hand?

1176
01:09:57,679 --> 01:09:59,476
Yeah.
Time me!

1177
01:10:27,275 --> 01:10:28,674
How long?

1178
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,244
About 30 seconds.

1179
01:10:34,549 --> 01:10:35,914
I'm rusty.

1180
01:10:36,985 --> 01:10:38,819
Where did you get
a gun, Colonel?

1181
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:41,448
Piece or weapon,
Charlie,
never gun.

1182
01:10:44,359 --> 01:10:46,520
Where did you
get the piece?

1183
01:10:46,994 --> 01:10:49,496
I'm an officer
in the US Army.

1184
01:10:49,497 --> 01:10:51,261
This is my sidearm.

1185
01:10:52,433 --> 01:10:54,067
But you're not
an officer anymore.

1186
01:10:54,068 --> 01:10:55,934
So I'm retired,
so what?

1187
01:10:56,371 --> 01:10:59,169
An officer never
relinquishes his.45.

1188
01:10:59,907 --> 01:11:03,643
You better relinquish
it to me or I'm gonna
have to call Mrs. Rossi.

1189
01:11:03,644 --> 01:11:05,203
Good idea.

1190
01:11:06,547 --> 01:11:08,448
Then I'm going
back to school.

1191
01:11:08,449 --> 01:11:11,051
Even better.
Blue skies, green lights.

1192
01:11:11,052 --> 01:11:12,853
I hope you have
a wonderful trip.

1193
01:11:12,854 --> 01:11:16,089
That felt like 25.
Gotta be able to
do a.45 in 25.

1194
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:17,290
Did you time me?

1195
01:11:17,291 --> 01:11:19,419
I did not and
I'm calling Albany.

1196
01:11:29,237 --> 01:11:30,670
That was stupid.

1197
01:11:32,173 --> 01:11:33,436
Was it?

1198
01:11:35,209 --> 01:11:37,041
You're stuck with me,
Charlie.

1199
01:11:38,045 --> 01:11:40,180
No, I'm not.
I'm outta here!

1200
01:11:40,181 --> 01:11:41,848
Where you going,
New Hampshire?

1201
01:11:41,849 --> 01:11:44,512
You got no money.
How you gonna do that?

1202
01:11:48,589 --> 01:11:50,922
Karen's number
tastes like Albany.

1203
01:11:54,128 --> 01:11:55,762
Fine.
I'm leaving.

1204
01:11:55,763 --> 01:11:58,164
Charlie. Charlie!

1205
01:12:10,845 --> 01:12:14,474
All I want from you
is another day.

1206
01:12:16,084 --> 01:12:17,415
For what?

1207
01:12:19,987 --> 01:12:22,957
One last tour
of the battlefield.

1208
01:12:26,694 --> 01:12:29,322
I can get around
a city like New York,

1209
01:12:30,264 --> 01:12:32,132
but I

1210
01:12:32,133 --> 01:12:35,125
sometimes need a point
in the right direction.

1211
01:12:38,306 --> 01:12:40,173
What do you say,
Charles?

1212
01:12:40,174 --> 01:12:43,144
What's one day
between friends?

1213
01:12:47,315 --> 01:12:50,011
All right. Say I stay
for another day.

1214
01:12:51,452 --> 01:12:53,119
Will you give me
your weapon?

1215
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,421
Oh, Charlie,

1216
01:12:54,422 --> 01:12:56,823
I'm a lieutenant colonel,
United States Army.

1217
01:12:56,824 --> 01:12:59,426
I'm not giving
my fucking gun
to anyone.

1218
01:12:59,427 --> 01:13:01,895
Now, what are
you drinkin'?

1219
01:13:01,896 --> 01:13:04,331
Colonel, this
is unacceptable.

1220
01:13:04,332 --> 01:13:07,434
Unacceptable?
What are you givin' me
that prep school crap for?

1221
01:13:07,435 --> 01:13:08,902
Unacceptable?

1222
01:13:08,903 --> 01:13:12,606
What have they done,
taken the Oregon
out of the boy?

1223
01:13:12,607 --> 01:13:14,973
Put in Harvard
Business School?

1224
01:13:15,943 --> 01:13:17,536
Then give me
your bullets.

1225
01:13:23,751 --> 01:13:26,948
You do see the sense of it,
Charlie, don't you?

1226
01:13:29,924 --> 01:13:32,256
I can't chew
the leather anymore.

1227
01:13:33,261 --> 01:13:37,664
So, why should I share
the tribe's provisions?

1228
01:13:40,334 --> 01:13:42,200
I mean, there's no one

1229
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:45,601
wants to tear a herring
with me anymore.

1230
01:13:48,309 --> 01:13:49,868
The bullets, Colonel.

1231
01:13:50,044 --> 01:13:51,478
"The bullets, Colonel."

1232
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:54,910
You sound like a guy in
Lives of a Bengal Lancer.

1233
01:14:14,135 --> 01:14:16,297
What do you
give a shit for?

1234
01:14:17,638 --> 01:14:19,205
About what?

1235
01:14:19,206 --> 01:14:20,572
About what?

1236
01:14:21,108 --> 01:14:23,907
About whether
I blow my brains
out or not.

1237
01:14:30,084 --> 01:14:31,918
Because I have
a conscience.

1238
01:14:31,919 --> 01:14:33,614
You have
a conscience.

1239
01:14:34,855 --> 01:14:36,221
I forgot.

1240
01:14:37,625 --> 01:14:39,593
The Charlie Conscience.

1241
01:14:41,596 --> 01:14:44,065
Do we tell?
Do we not tell?

1242
01:14:45,733 --> 01:14:48,498
Do we follow
the rich boy's code
or not?

1243
01:14:49,503 --> 01:14:51,631
Do we let this
blind asshole

1244
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:54,667
die or not?

1245
01:14:55,209 --> 01:14:56,506
Yeah.

1246
01:14:56,978 --> 01:14:58,741
Conscience, Charlie.

1247
01:14:59,981 --> 01:15:01,608
When were
you born, son?

1248
01:15:01,949 --> 01:15:04,050
Around the time
of the Round Table?

1249
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:07,247
Haven't you heard?

1250
01:15:07,722 --> 01:15:10,555
Conscience is dead.

1251
01:15:11,659 --> 01:15:13,260
No, I haven't heard.

1252
01:15:13,261 --> 01:15:16,958
Then take the fucking wax
outta your ears!

1253
01:15:20,034 --> 01:15:21,297
Grow up!

1254
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,209
It's fuck your buddy.

1255
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:37,343
Cheat on your wife.

1256
01:15:40,721 --> 01:15:43,190
Call your mother
on Mother's Day.

1257
01:15:45,393 --> 01:15:46,656
Charlie,

1258
01:15:47,828 --> 01:15:49,728
it's all shit.

1259
01:16:01,275 --> 01:16:02,834
Where you goin'?

1260
01:16:03,744 --> 01:16:05,440
I got piss call.

1261
01:16:07,114 --> 01:16:10,216
I know I said I need ya
forjust one day

1262
01:16:10,217 --> 01:16:12,709
but even I can't
hold it that long.

1263
01:16:15,222 --> 01:16:16,656
Oh, and Charlie,

1264
01:16:18,259 --> 01:16:20,750
you forgot the one
in the chamber.

1265
01:16:28,836 --> 01:16:30,304
There you go, sir.

1266
01:16:31,038 --> 01:16:32,301
Thank you.

1267
01:16:35,343 --> 01:16:37,641
Twenty-six years
in the service,

1268
01:16:38,312 --> 01:16:40,576
never let an aide
shine my shoes.

1269
01:16:41,282 --> 01:16:44,047
Where you gonna be
in 26 years, Charlie?

1270
01:16:44,652 --> 01:16:48,418
Playing golf with
your friends from
the Baird School, I bet.

1271
01:16:51,459 --> 01:16:53,860
I don't even
like those guys.

1272
01:16:53,861 --> 01:16:56,694
Of course you don't.
They're all assholes.

1273
01:16:57,898 --> 01:17:00,629
Be a pleasure to
squeal on 'em,
wouldn't it?

1274
01:17:01,368 --> 01:17:03,136
Yeah, well,
I'm not a squealer.

1275
01:17:03,137 --> 01:17:04,671
"I'm not a squealer."

1276
01:17:04,672 --> 01:17:06,868
What is this,
the Dreyfus case?

1277
01:17:11,078 --> 01:17:13,206
Ooh. Ooh, mama!

1278
01:17:14,148 --> 01:17:15,448
There you go.

1279
01:17:15,449 --> 01:17:16,950
Thank you.

1280
01:17:16,951 --> 01:17:18,646
Thank you.

1281
01:17:19,453 --> 01:17:21,012
Watch your step.

1282
01:17:23,524 --> 01:17:26,585
I'm gettin' that heavy
feelin' again, Charlie.

1283
01:17:29,997 --> 01:17:32,159
There's more to this,
isn't there?

1284
01:17:33,467 --> 01:17:34,958
Isn't there?

1285
01:17:38,272 --> 01:17:40,172
I was offered
a bribe.

1286
01:17:40,674 --> 01:17:42,370
Now we're cookin'.

1287
01:17:43,677 --> 01:17:46,010
Mr. Trask,
the headmaster,

1288
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:50,316
he promised to get
me into Harvard.

1289
01:17:50,317 --> 01:17:51,842
If you squeal.

1290
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:53,620
Yeah.

1291
01:17:53,621 --> 01:17:55,522
What a dilemma.

1292
01:17:55,523 --> 01:17:59,357
Should Charlie Simms
accept a free ride
into Harvard, or not?

1293
01:18:01,529 --> 01:18:05,532
What do you think your
friend George would do
if he were in your shoes?

1294
01:18:05,533 --> 01:18:07,000
He is,
practically.

1295
01:18:07,001 --> 01:18:08,468
How?

1296
01:18:08,469 --> 01:18:12,806
It's just that Mr. Trask
hasn't promised to get
him into Harvard.

1297
01:18:12,807 --> 01:18:14,641
Mr. Trask
doesn't have to.

1298
01:18:14,642 --> 01:18:17,042
George's father's
gonna take care
of that.

1299
01:18:19,046 --> 01:18:21,310
Do the deal,
Charlie. Take it!

1300
01:18:21,949 --> 01:18:23,383
Go to Harvard.

1301
01:18:24,351 --> 01:18:25,685
I can't do that.

1302
01:18:25,686 --> 01:18:26,881
Why not?

1303
01:18:29,223 --> 01:18:32,022
There are just
some things
you can't do.

1304
01:18:32,793 --> 01:18:34,523
Explain 'em to me.

1305
01:18:36,197 --> 01:18:37,530
Louder, please.

1306
01:18:37,531 --> 01:18:38,897
I can't...

1307
01:18:41,068 --> 01:18:44,470
You're gonna
have a tough time
in this world, Charlie.

1308
01:18:45,573 --> 01:18:49,066
To ease the blow,
let me buy you
a drink. Come on.

1309
01:18:50,611 --> 01:18:53,012
Double
Jack Daniels on the rocks.

1310
01:18:53,013 --> 01:18:56,245
And bring my
young friend here
a Shirley Temple.

1311
01:18:56,884 --> 01:18:59,046
Hold on.
Do you have beer?

1312
01:18:59,353 --> 01:19:01,855
Certainly. May I
see some ID?

1313
01:19:01,856 --> 01:19:05,158
Are you interested
in walkin' the rest
of your life, chappy?

1314
01:19:05,159 --> 01:19:06,392
I'm sorry, sir, but...

1315
01:19:06,393 --> 01:19:09,488
I'm a regular here.
My boy's going on 23.

1316
01:19:09,864 --> 01:19:12,699
Why don't you
call up front,
the office?

1317
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:15,499
Mr. Gilbert,
he's a friend of mine.

1318
01:19:17,838 --> 01:19:19,639
Any particular beer?

1319
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:22,405
Schlitz. No Schlitz?

1320
01:19:22,910 --> 01:19:25,276
Blatz. No Blatz?

1321
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:27,643
Lmprovise.

1322
01:19:28,849 --> 01:19:30,316
I'll do my best, sir.

1323
01:19:30,317 --> 01:19:31,284
Thank you, sir.

1324
01:19:31,285 --> 01:19:32,184
Thank you, sir.

1325
01:19:32,987 --> 01:19:35,649
You're human, Charlie.
Beer?

1326
01:19:39,159 --> 01:19:41,151
Who are we
drinking with?

1327
01:19:41,328 --> 01:19:44,890
I'm getting
a nice soap-and-water
feeling from down there.

1328
01:19:53,007 --> 01:19:54,804
A female.

1329
01:19:55,075 --> 01:19:56,634
"Female"?

1330
01:19:57,244 --> 01:20:00,908
You callin' her female
must mean you like her
or you wouldn't be so casual.

1331
01:20:04,518 --> 01:20:05,885
Is she alone?

1332
01:20:05,886 --> 01:20:07,251
Yeah, she's alone.

1333
01:20:09,356 --> 01:20:11,017
Things are heatin' up.

1334
01:20:11,592 --> 01:20:13,185
Chestnut hair?

1335
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:15,986
Brown, light brown.

1336
01:20:18,165 --> 01:20:19,565
Twenty-two?

1337
01:20:22,002 --> 01:20:24,301
What am I,
a guy at a carnival?

1338
01:20:24,838 --> 01:20:27,740
The day we stop lookin',
Charlie, is the day we die.

1339
01:20:28,742 --> 01:20:29,869
Move.

1340
01:20:30,144 --> 01:20:32,178
Where?
You know where, son.

1341
01:20:32,179 --> 01:20:34,011
Don't be coy, Charlie.

1342
01:20:36,116 --> 01:20:38,949
This woman is
made for you.
I can feel it.

1343
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,716
Goddamn beautiful,
isn't she?

1344
01:20:41,956 --> 01:20:44,857
She's not bad.
Bingo! The boy's alive.

1345
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:48,859
Come on, son,
perambulate.

1346
01:20:49,863 --> 01:20:51,388
Perambulate.

1347
01:21:00,975 --> 01:21:04,411
Excuse me, se·orita,
do you mind if
we join you?

1348
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:08,906
I'm feelin' you're
being neglected.

1349
01:21:09,950 --> 01:21:11,884
I'm expecting somebody.

1350
01:21:13,921 --> 01:21:15,286
Instantly?

1351
01:21:16,657 --> 01:21:18,558
No, but any minute now.

1352
01:21:18,559 --> 01:21:19,859
Any minute?

1353
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:22,659
Some people live
a lifetime
in a minute.

1354
01:21:23,831 --> 01:21:25,924
What are you doin'
right now?

1355
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,293
I'm waiting for him.

1356
01:21:28,902 --> 01:21:31,497
Would you mind if
we waited with you,

1357
01:21:32,773 --> 01:21:35,765
just to keep
the womanizers
from bothering you?

1358
01:21:39,546 --> 01:21:41,208
No, I don't mind.

1359
01:21:41,582 --> 01:21:43,049
Thank you.

1360
01:21:46,553 --> 01:21:47,748
Charlie.

1361
01:21:51,392 --> 01:21:54,727
You know, I detect
a fragrance
in the air.

1362
01:21:54,728 --> 01:21:56,753
Don't tell me
what it is.

1363
01:21:57,731 --> 01:21:59,631
Ogilvie Sisters
soap.

1364
01:22:01,568 --> 01:22:03,069
That's amazing.

1365
01:22:03,070 --> 01:22:05,271
I'm in the
amazing business.

1366
01:22:05,272 --> 01:22:07,263
It is
Ogilvie Sisters
soap.

1367
01:22:07,941 --> 01:22:10,209
My grandmother gave me
three bars for Christmas.

1368
01:22:10,210 --> 01:22:12,445
I'm crazy about
your grandmother.

1369
01:22:12,446 --> 01:22:15,006
I think she'd have
liked Charlie, too.

1370
01:22:15,582 --> 01:22:17,316
Don't pay any
attention to him.

1371
01:22:17,317 --> 01:22:18,818
What's your name?

1372
01:22:18,819 --> 01:22:20,119
Donna.

1373
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:23,256
Donna? I'm Frank.
This here is...

1374
01:22:23,257 --> 01:22:24,590
Charlie.

1375
01:22:24,591 --> 01:22:26,423
Yes.
She likes you.

1376
01:22:27,528 --> 01:22:29,529
Charlie's having
a difficult weekend.

1377
01:22:29,530 --> 01:22:31,064
He's going
through a crisis.

1378
01:22:31,065 --> 01:22:33,933
How does he look like
he's holding up?

1379
01:22:33,934 --> 01:22:35,868
He looks fine to me.

1380
01:22:35,869 --> 01:22:37,860
She does like you,
Charlie.

1381
01:22:43,877 --> 01:22:45,209
So, Donna,

1382
01:22:48,148 --> 01:22:49,639
do you tango?

1383
01:22:50,284 --> 01:22:52,912
No. I wanted to
learn once, but...

1384
01:22:53,487 --> 01:22:54,579
But?

1385
01:22:56,256 --> 01:22:58,091
But Michael
didn't want to.

1386
01:22:58,092 --> 01:22:59,926
Michael.

1387
01:22:59,927 --> 01:23:02,123
The one you're
waiting for.

1388
01:23:02,796 --> 01:23:05,459
Michael thinks
the tango's hysterical.

1389
01:23:05,866 --> 01:23:07,925
I think Michael's
hysterical.

1390
01:23:08,736 --> 01:23:10,603
Don't pay any
attention to him.

1391
01:23:10,604 --> 01:23:12,197
Did I already
say that?

1392
01:23:14,741 --> 01:23:16,539
What a beautiful laugh.

1393
01:23:18,278 --> 01:23:19,905
Thank you, Frank.

1394
01:23:25,619 --> 01:23:28,316
Would you like
to learn to tango,
Donna?

1395
01:23:31,125 --> 01:23:32,490
Right now?

1396
01:23:33,894 --> 01:23:37,563
I'm offering you
my services,
free of charge.

1397
01:23:37,564 --> 01:23:39,089
What do you say?

1398
01:23:42,569 --> 01:23:44,560
I think I'd be
a little afraid.

1399
01:23:45,939 --> 01:23:47,202
Of what?

1400
01:23:48,075 --> 01:23:50,237
Afraid of making
a mistake.

1401
01:23:51,779 --> 01:23:55,548
No mistakes
in the tango, Donna.
Not like life.

1402
01:23:55,549 --> 01:23:58,417
It's simple.
That's what makes
the tango so great.

1403
01:23:58,418 --> 01:24:01,877
If you make a mistake,
get all tangled up,
just tango on.

1404
01:24:05,092 --> 01:24:06,821
Why don't you try?

1405
01:24:11,198 --> 01:24:12,791
Will you try it?

1406
01:24:14,768 --> 01:24:16,896
All right.
I'll give it a try.

1407
01:24:18,238 --> 01:24:19,865
Hold me down, son.

1408
01:24:26,446 --> 01:24:27,778
Your arm?

1409
01:24:30,784 --> 01:24:32,047
Charlie,

1410
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:36,055
I'm gonna need some
coordinates here, son.

1411
01:24:36,056 --> 01:24:39,058
The floor's about
20 by 30,

1412
01:24:39,059 --> 01:24:41,221
and you're at
the long end.

1413
01:24:42,129 --> 01:24:44,330
There's some tables
on the outside and

1414
01:24:44,331 --> 01:24:46,265
the band's
on the right.

1415
01:27:26,426 --> 01:27:30,192
Frank, you are
one incredible
dancer.

1416
01:27:33,033 --> 01:27:35,331
Wait'll you see
Charlie dance.

1417
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:37,970
He's a liar.
I don't dance.

1418
01:27:37,971 --> 01:27:39,505
Isn't he a charmer,
though?

1419
01:27:39,506 --> 01:27:41,707
Truth is,
not only can he dance,

1420
01:27:41,708 --> 01:27:43,576
but he'll sing you
a hell of a tune.

1421
01:27:43,577 --> 01:27:46,345
He can do bird calls
and imitate Bela Lugosi.

1422
01:27:46,346 --> 01:27:47,480
Hi, honey.

1423
01:27:47,481 --> 01:27:48,539
Hi.
Hey.

1424
01:27:49,116 --> 01:27:51,884
Michael, this is Frank
and this is Charlie.

1425
01:27:51,885 --> 01:27:54,120
Hi, Frank, Charlie.
Sorry I'm late.

1426
01:27:54,121 --> 01:27:55,520
That's okay.

1427
01:27:55,956 --> 01:27:58,557
These two gentlemen
entertained me,

1428
01:27:58,558 --> 01:28:00,151
and time flew.

1429
01:28:00,327 --> 01:28:03,092
Your girl is a hell
of a tango dancer.

1430
01:28:03,530 --> 01:28:06,632
At last,
you found someone
to tango with.

1431
01:28:06,633 --> 01:28:08,067
That's terrific!

1432
01:28:08,068 --> 01:28:09,702
Let me shake your hand.

1433
01:28:09,703 --> 01:28:11,537
No, it was Frank.

1434
01:28:11,538 --> 01:28:13,666
Hell, I'll shake
both your hands!

1435
01:28:14,841 --> 01:28:17,877
This looks like
the place, but
we gotta go.

1436
01:28:17,878 --> 01:28:21,680
We got a date with
Darryl and Carol
in the Village.

1437
01:28:21,681 --> 01:28:24,183
Do you have a check?
Michael, please.

1438
01:28:24,184 --> 01:28:25,851
My pleasure.

1439
01:28:25,852 --> 01:28:27,153
No, no. I got this.

1440
01:28:27,154 --> 01:28:29,088
Michael, get your hand
outta your pocket.

1441
01:28:29,089 --> 01:28:30,784
I'll take it. Really.

1442
01:28:31,425 --> 01:28:32,824
Allow me.

1443
01:28:35,228 --> 01:28:36,762
Why, thank you.

1444
01:28:36,763 --> 01:28:38,254
Bye, guys.

1445
01:28:38,765 --> 01:28:39,789
Bye.

1446
01:28:48,041 --> 01:28:51,011
Darryl and Carol.
Yeah.

1447
01:28:59,786 --> 01:29:01,654
It's apartment 17E,
Colonel.

1448
01:29:01,655 --> 01:29:03,289
She's expecting you.

1449
01:29:03,290 --> 01:29:07,226
Don't worry about a thing.
She's the cr·me de la cr·me.

1450
01:29:07,227 --> 01:29:09,795
My buddy took
the Vice Chancellor
of Germany to her.

1451
01:29:09,796 --> 01:29:12,095
Now he wants to
immigrate to this country.

1452
01:29:12,332 --> 01:29:14,460
You did good, hombre.

1453
01:29:16,703 --> 01:29:18,501
My hair, how is it?

1454
01:29:19,639 --> 01:29:21,073
It's perfect.

1455
01:29:24,478 --> 01:29:26,446
I got the red
foulard okay,
didn't I?

1456
01:29:27,013 --> 01:29:28,714
Yeah,
real dark red.

1457
01:29:28,715 --> 01:29:31,742
Burgundy, Charlie.
Burgundy. They love it.

1458
01:29:34,187 --> 01:29:35,416
Bay rum.

1459
01:29:37,691 --> 01:29:39,158
Windsor knot.

1460
01:29:42,028 --> 01:29:44,156
That's my heart
I'm feelin'.

1461
01:29:54,107 --> 01:29:55,302
I'm off.

1462
01:30:13,727 --> 01:30:15,227
Can you get long
distance on this?

1463
01:30:15,228 --> 01:30:17,128
And how. Be my guest.

1464
01:30:28,174 --> 01:30:29,608
Sugarbush Lodge.

1465
01:30:29,609 --> 01:30:31,177
Hi. George Willis, please?

1466
01:30:31,178 --> 01:30:32,975
One moment, please.

1467
01:30:34,648 --> 01:30:36,715
Hello?
Harry?

1468
01:30:36,716 --> 01:30:38,951
Chas, how are you?

1469
01:30:38,952 --> 01:30:42,221
You just caught us.
We're about to shoot
George over to the airport.

1470
01:30:42,222 --> 01:30:44,623
Why is George going
to the airport?

1471
01:30:45,125 --> 01:30:48,322
Hold on. Maybe
you should talk
to the man himself.

1472
01:30:49,596 --> 01:30:50,729
Chas.

1473
01:30:50,730 --> 01:30:51,864
Yeah. Hi, George.

1474
01:30:51,865 --> 01:30:53,232
You just caught me.

1475
01:30:53,233 --> 01:30:55,935
That's what Harry said.
Where you goin'?

1476
01:30:55,936 --> 01:30:57,236
Home.

1477
01:30:57,237 --> 01:30:58,504
To Boston?

1478
01:30:58,505 --> 01:31:01,373
Catching the puddle·umper.
Keep your fingers crossed.

1479
01:31:01,374 --> 01:31:03,604
What are you
going home for?

1480
01:31:06,513 --> 01:31:10,472
I was thinking.
This asshole, Trask?
He's making no sense at all.

1481
01:31:11,785 --> 01:31:15,487
Somebody's gotta talk to him.
My father was class of '59.

1482
01:31:15,488 --> 01:31:19,357
Your father?
I thought we were gonna
keep our parents outta this.

1483
01:31:19,659 --> 01:31:22,390
This guy Trask
is out of control, Chas.

1484
01:31:22,996 --> 01:31:26,065
Out of control!
Somebody's gotta
talk to him.

1485
01:31:26,066 --> 01:31:28,091
My father's
a major fundraiser,
you know.

1486
01:31:28,969 --> 01:31:30,135
No, I didn't.

1487
01:31:30,136 --> 01:31:31,303
Right.

1488
01:31:31,304 --> 01:31:33,671
Relax. He'll get us
off the hook.

1489
01:31:33,873 --> 01:31:35,674
I gotta go.
Everything all right?

1490
01:31:35,675 --> 01:31:36,836
Sure.

1491
01:31:37,043 --> 01:31:39,103
I'll see you Monday.
Goodbye.

1492
01:31:39,412 --> 01:31:40,505
Bye.

1493
01:32:05,238 --> 01:32:07,263
Good night, sir.
Good night.

1494
01:32:19,653 --> 01:32:20,642
Hiya, Charlie.

1495
01:32:22,989 --> 01:32:24,480
Watch the door.

1496
01:32:43,109 --> 01:32:45,237
What a beautiful woman.

1497
01:32:59,259 --> 01:33:01,160
Hello, there.

1498
01:33:01,161 --> 01:33:03,095
Do you
see what I see?

1499
01:33:03,096 --> 01:33:05,931
Yeah.
Either there's
something wrong,

1500
01:33:05,932 --> 01:33:08,334
or we got the world's
worst hangover.

1501
01:33:08,335 --> 01:33:10,436
Won't you come in?

1502
01:33:10,437 --> 01:33:13,304
We hear
you got a picture of
the bank robbery.

1503
01:33:30,857 --> 01:33:32,154
Colonel?

1504
01:33:46,539 --> 01:33:48,439
Colonel,
you all right?

1505
01:33:50,176 --> 01:33:51,610
What is it?

1506
01:33:55,482 --> 01:33:57,249
It's after noon.

1507
01:33:57,250 --> 01:33:59,548
You've been sleeping
all morning.

1508
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:02,020
So what?

1509
01:34:04,524 --> 01:34:06,356
I don't know.
I thought...

1510
01:34:11,264 --> 01:34:13,255
I talked to George
last night.

1511
01:34:15,602 --> 01:34:19,595
His father's a big-deal
alumnus at school.
He's got a lot of pull.

1512
01:34:21,241 --> 01:34:22,572
Really?

1513
01:34:25,044 --> 01:34:28,503
Yeah, he's gonna talk
to the headmaster.

1514
01:34:30,350 --> 01:34:33,552
George thinks he might
be able to get us
off the hook.

1515
01:34:33,553 --> 01:34:35,453
"Get us off the hook."

1516
01:34:36,222 --> 01:34:38,213
Yeah, that's what he said.

1517
01:34:39,993 --> 01:34:41,893
Watch the "us" part.

1518
01:34:45,031 --> 01:34:48,262
Colonel, don't you wanna
get up and do something?

1519
01:34:52,405 --> 01:34:53,634
Colonel?

1520
01:34:54,574 --> 01:34:56,599
Charlie, what do
you want?

1521
01:34:57,210 --> 01:34:59,711
I don't know,

1522
01:34:59,712 --> 01:35:01,874
but you're making
me nervous.

1523
01:35:04,751 --> 01:35:06,981
My wallet is
on the dresser.

1524
01:35:08,655 --> 01:35:10,714
Take out your plane ticket

1525
01:35:11,591 --> 01:35:15,823
and $400
mustering-out pay, plus

1526
01:35:17,430 --> 01:35:20,730
airport-to-school taxi.

1527
01:35:23,703 --> 01:35:26,365
Colonel, it's no rush.
I mean, I can...

1528
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:29,007
I could stay for a while.

1529
01:35:29,008 --> 01:35:31,307
Charlie, you already
gave me a day.

1530
01:35:32,846 --> 01:35:35,872
And for that day,
I am eternally grateful.

1531
01:35:38,551 --> 01:35:42,454
But right now
I have other plans.

1532
01:35:44,057 --> 01:35:46,321
What other plans
do you have?

1533
01:35:48,495 --> 01:35:49,985
To die, son.

1534
01:35:51,865 --> 01:35:53,594
Colonel, you're...

1535
01:35:54,234 --> 01:35:57,260
Come on, Colonel,
you're not gonna die today.

1536
01:35:57,804 --> 01:36:00,034
Charlie,
give me your hand.

1537
01:36:04,711 --> 01:36:06,577
You go now, boy.
Okay?

1538
01:36:09,182 --> 01:36:11,014
You go. Just...

1539
01:36:14,787 --> 01:36:16,881
Just leave me
sleep here.

1540
01:36:18,391 --> 01:36:21,326
Look...
Can we start
over, please?

1541
01:36:22,629 --> 01:36:24,995
What do you feel
like doin' today, huh?

1542
01:36:25,765 --> 01:36:28,267
Look at this.
The sun is shining!

1543
01:36:28,268 --> 01:36:30,429
It's a beautiful day.
Let's...

1544
01:36:34,641 --> 01:36:37,809
Colonel, I know you don't
want to be a party poop,

1545
01:36:37,810 --> 01:36:39,678
so let's go out
and do something.

1546
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:41,443
Let's go for a ride.

1547
01:36:46,953 --> 01:36:48,443
Yeah, a ride.

1548
01:36:50,857 --> 01:36:52,654
A ride?

1549
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:56,295
Yeah, Colonel Slade,
what do you say?

1550
01:36:56,296 --> 01:36:58,127
Let's go
for a ride, huh?

1551
01:37:06,072 --> 01:37:07,767
What kind of ride?

1552
01:37:09,909 --> 01:37:12,811
Yeah, this is a valid
Oregon driver's license,

1553
01:37:12,812 --> 01:37:16,615
and we let appropriate
customers test-drive
the Testarossa.

1554
01:37:16,616 --> 01:37:20,586
But you're 17, with
a blind companion.
That we don't do.

1555
01:37:20,587 --> 01:37:22,854
This is a $100,000
piece of machinery.

1556
01:37:22,855 --> 01:37:25,324
I'm not letting it
out this door.

1557
01:37:25,325 --> 01:37:26,892
How about this one
over here?

1558
01:37:26,893 --> 01:37:29,528
That's a Cabriolet T.
The same deal.

1559
01:37:29,529 --> 01:37:33,966
You think I'll let
an unaccompanied kid
get in a $110,000 car?

1560
01:37:33,967 --> 01:37:36,197
He will not be
unaccompanied.

1561
01:37:37,070 --> 01:37:39,698
I'll be with him.
I'm his father.

1562
01:37:40,473 --> 01:37:42,074
You're his father?

1563
01:37:42,075 --> 01:37:43,269
Yes.

1564
01:37:43,710 --> 01:37:46,778
I have an idea. Why don't
I take your father
for a test drive?

1565
01:37:46,779 --> 01:37:48,747
What's your quota, Freddie?

1566
01:37:48,748 --> 01:37:50,749
Don't worry
about my quota.
I do well.

1567
01:37:50,750 --> 01:37:52,784
How many Ferraris
you sold this month?

1568
01:37:52,785 --> 01:37:55,420
That's not relevant
to this discussion.

1569
01:37:55,421 --> 01:37:57,151
Freddie,
the '·0s are over.

1570
01:37:57,623 --> 01:38:00,459
Are you tryin' to tell me
these things are walkin'
outta the store?

1571
01:38:00,460 --> 01:38:04,663
This is a Ferrari, sir,
the finest machinery made
in the automobile industry.

1572
01:38:04,664 --> 01:38:08,000
If you like it that much,
why don't you sleep with it?
Why are you sellin' it?

1573
01:38:08,001 --> 01:38:09,501
I'd love to
accommodate you...

1574
01:38:09,502 --> 01:38:12,604
If this car performs
the way I expect it to,

1575
01:38:12,605 --> 01:38:16,308
you will get
a check of $101,000,
and change,

1576
01:38:16,309 --> 01:38:18,410
when you come in
here tomorrow morning.

1577
01:38:18,411 --> 01:38:22,414
It's $100,000,
plus $050,
plus tax.

1578
01:38:22,415 --> 01:38:25,217
Freddie, for you

1579
01:38:25,218 --> 01:38:27,986
107 all in,

1580
01:38:27,987 --> 01:38:31,548
plus a case of champagne
to go with your
leftover turkey.

1581
01:38:32,825 --> 01:38:35,627
What do you say?
Don't worry about
the boy.

1582
01:38:35,628 --> 01:38:39,364
He drives so smooth,
you can boil an egg
on the engine.

1583
01:38:39,365 --> 01:38:42,562
When we bring
the car back, I'll peel
the egg for ya.

1584
01:38:43,603 --> 01:38:47,198
Listen, you made me laugh,
but I can't let
the car go out.

1585
01:38:49,175 --> 01:38:50,976
Want a deposit?

1586
01:38:50,977 --> 01:38:53,412
This is not an
installment item, sir.

1587
01:38:56,783 --> 01:39:00,378
Freddie, you're
no spring chicken.

1588
01:39:02,555 --> 01:39:06,758
You know what they call me
at the home office?
"The Grey Ghost."

1589
01:39:06,759 --> 01:39:09,161
You know why they
still keep me around?

1590
01:39:09,162 --> 01:39:12,631
There's no kid here
that can move a Ferrari
like I can.

1591
01:39:12,632 --> 01:39:15,333
I'm known from
coast to coast
like butter and toast.

1592
01:39:15,334 --> 01:39:17,803
Ask anybody about
Freddie Bisco.

1593
01:39:17,804 --> 01:39:19,304
When I get a Ferrari...

1594
01:39:19,305 --> 01:39:20,939
Out the door!

1595
01:39:22,375 --> 01:39:24,109
You just made
me laugh, Freddie.

1596
01:39:24,110 --> 01:39:25,305
Yeah?

1597
01:39:26,045 --> 01:39:27,308
2,000.

1598
01:39:28,614 --> 01:39:31,516
Unless you take it,
you're gonna make me cry.

1599
01:39:34,787 --> 01:39:36,653
I'm a grey ghost, too.

1600
01:39:48,067 --> 01:39:51,128
See? This is fun,
isn't it?

1601
01:40:05,718 --> 01:40:09,120
Drop her into neutral.
Slide her into second.

1602
01:40:09,655 --> 01:40:11,089
Pop the clutch.

1603
01:40:48,728 --> 01:40:51,530
Straight.
Hold it right
like that.

1604
01:40:51,531 --> 01:40:53,765
Feel it?
That's straight.

1605
01:40:53,766 --> 01:40:55,996
It's a straight street,
so keep it straight.

1606
01:40:58,804 --> 01:41:00,272
Keep it straight.

1607
01:41:00,273 --> 01:41:01,940
No fun just
to keep it straight.

1608
01:41:01,941 --> 01:41:04,876
You've got to move
a little bit,
feel the road.

1609
01:41:05,278 --> 01:41:08,270
Please? Just like this.
All right? There you go.

1610
01:41:08,815 --> 01:41:10,715
Take it nice and easy.

1611
01:41:11,551 --> 01:41:13,251
Do you like this?

1612
01:41:16,889 --> 01:41:19,950
Slow it down
a little, Colonel.
You're goin' a little fast.

1613
01:41:20,927 --> 01:41:23,191
Colonel, slow it down.

1614
01:41:24,030 --> 01:41:26,055
Something's happened
to my foot!

1615
01:41:27,834 --> 01:41:29,067
Slow it down, please.

1616
01:41:29,068 --> 01:41:31,730
Hold on. I think
I've got another gear.

1617
01:41:32,638 --> 01:41:34,163
Colonel Slade?

1618
01:41:35,708 --> 01:41:36,903
Hoo-ah!

1619
01:41:37,944 --> 01:41:39,172
Watch out!

1620
01:41:43,115 --> 01:41:44,416
You'll get us killed!

1621
01:41:44,417 --> 01:41:46,783
Don't blame me,
Charlie, I can't see!

1622
01:41:49,422 --> 01:41:50,822
Colonel,
slow it down!

1623
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:02,629
Oh, Jesus!

1624
01:42:03,135 --> 01:42:05,937
Now let's see how
this baby corners.

1625
01:42:05,938 --> 01:42:07,005
Corners?

1626
01:42:07,006 --> 01:42:08,474
Yeah. Say when.

1627
01:42:09,108 --> 01:42:10,375
Say when what?

1628
01:42:10,376 --> 01:42:11,676
Say when to turn.

1629
01:42:11,677 --> 01:42:13,612
Colonel,
you can't turn the car.

1630
01:42:13,613 --> 01:42:15,308
Where's
the turn, Charlie?

1631
01:42:15,848 --> 01:42:19,317
3 o'clock? 2 o'clock?
Right oblique? Right face?

1632
01:42:19,318 --> 01:42:21,014
Come on! Talk to me!

1633
01:42:22,054 --> 01:42:23,688
It's left, I guess.

1634
01:42:23,689 --> 01:42:26,352
Left. I knew it. Okay. Now?

1635
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:30,088
No, no! Not now! Not now!

1636
01:42:31,364 --> 01:42:32,524
Now?

1637
01:42:32,832 --> 01:42:34,132
Colonel, please!

1638
01:42:34,133 --> 01:42:36,434
I'm gonna do it anyway,
all right?

1639
01:42:36,435 --> 01:42:38,536
Whether you say so
or not, here we go!

1640
01:42:38,537 --> 01:42:40,972
Okay! Wait, wait, wait!
Just wait!

1641
01:42:40,973 --> 01:42:43,241
Here I go.

1642
01:42:43,242 --> 01:42:45,176
Wait... Now!

1643
01:42:51,651 --> 01:42:54,518
I did it! Charlie!

1644
01:42:56,122 --> 01:42:58,955
You're ridin' with
one very happy man!

1645
01:43:00,693 --> 01:43:02,060
Turn again!

1646
01:43:02,061 --> 01:43:03,290
Be specific, son.

1647
01:43:04,030 --> 01:43:05,130
Left now!

1648
01:43:05,131 --> 01:43:06,223
Okay.

1649
01:43:11,370 --> 01:43:13,999
I love this! I love it!

1650
01:43:15,574 --> 01:43:17,440
Shall we take it to the max?

1651
01:43:17,710 --> 01:43:19,200
Let me out.

1652
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:23,378
Shit!
The yellow flag.

1653
01:43:24,317 --> 01:43:27,419
I haven't even
opened her up yet.
Which way's the curb?

1654
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:29,955
Pull over. Slow down!
Slow down.

1655
01:43:29,956 --> 01:43:31,156
I'm doin' it.

1656
01:43:31,157 --> 01:43:33,158
Pull over to
the curb, here.
Slow down.

1657
01:43:33,159 --> 01:43:34,285
Yep. Got it.

1658
01:43:47,807 --> 01:43:50,242
Haven't had
a ticket in years.

1659
01:43:53,546 --> 01:43:55,275
I'll do the talking.

1660
01:44:00,953 --> 01:44:02,944
License
and registration.

1661
01:44:15,167 --> 01:44:17,235
Are you test-driving
this baby?

1662
01:44:17,236 --> 01:44:19,136
Don't she purr, though?

1663
01:44:19,705 --> 01:44:21,539
At 70 miles an hour?

1664
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:24,008
You should hear
her at 125.

1665
01:44:25,811 --> 01:44:27,643
Where's your license?

1666
01:44:29,215 --> 01:44:30,882
At the dealer's.

1667
01:44:30,883 --> 01:44:33,545
They give it back
when you return the car.

1668
01:44:34,553 --> 01:44:36,054
You got ID?

1669
01:44:36,055 --> 01:44:37,614
You bet.

1670
01:44:38,858 --> 01:44:40,223
Indeed.

1671
01:44:44,163 --> 01:44:46,097
Lieutenant Colonel Slade.

1672
01:44:46,732 --> 01:44:48,393
And you, soldier?

1673
01:44:49,201 --> 01:44:51,727
The name is
Police Officer Gore.

1674
01:44:53,572 --> 01:44:55,673
Doin' a hell
of a job, Gore.

1675
01:44:55,674 --> 01:44:57,700
And so are you,
Colonel.

1676
01:44:58,844 --> 01:45:00,335
Who's the kid?

1677
01:45:01,414 --> 01:45:03,281
My boy Charlie.

1678
01:45:03,282 --> 01:45:05,350
He kept tellin' me
to "let her out."

1679
01:45:05,351 --> 01:45:07,581
What was I gonna do,
disappoint him?

1680
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:09,281
Yes.

1681
01:45:13,192 --> 01:45:15,260
Tell you what
I'm gonna do,
Colonel.

1682
01:45:15,261 --> 01:45:18,163
I'm gonna let you go,
on one condition.

1683
01:45:18,164 --> 01:45:19,597
What's that?

1684
01:45:19,899 --> 01:45:22,663
That you take this rig
straight back to the dealer.

1685
01:45:24,937 --> 01:45:26,371
You got it.

1686
01:45:26,372 --> 01:45:27,669
Shut up.

1687
01:45:28,441 --> 01:45:29,840
You want this?

1688
01:45:30,176 --> 01:45:31,473
Sure.

1689
01:45:32,478 --> 01:45:34,037
Gore?

1690
01:45:34,513 --> 01:45:37,348
Your face and
your voice
are familiar.

1691
01:45:37,349 --> 01:45:40,080
You ever been
in the officer's
club at Da Nang?

1692
01:45:40,986 --> 01:45:42,320
No.

1693
01:45:42,321 --> 01:45:44,016
Never in the Army?

1694
01:45:45,157 --> 01:45:46,784
No. Coast Guard.

1695
01:45:47,426 --> 01:45:49,027
Good Lord.

1696
01:45:54,366 --> 01:45:56,768
Your dad
is looking good,
Charlie.

1697
01:45:56,769 --> 01:46:00,296
He's got a heavy foot, though.
Tell him to take it light,
all right?

1698
01:46:01,674 --> 01:46:03,608
I hear ya!
All right.

1699
01:46:03,609 --> 01:46:04,804
Thanks.

1700
01:46:17,790 --> 01:46:20,959
Get out of the car,
because you are not
driving anymore.

1701
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:23,793
Just keeping this baby
warm, that's all.

1702
01:46:25,631 --> 01:46:27,725
I'm not drivin' anymore.

1703
01:46:32,171 --> 01:46:33,366
Yes.

1704
01:46:38,711 --> 01:46:40,543
Take my arm.
I'm okay.

1705
01:46:41,013 --> 01:46:43,380
Colonel,
it's really
bumpy here.

1706
01:46:57,396 --> 01:46:58,989
You all right?

1707
01:47:02,401 --> 01:47:03,459
Yeah.

1708
01:47:11,644 --> 01:47:13,612
Red light. Hold it.

1709
01:47:20,019 --> 01:47:21,612
Taking too long.

1710
01:47:25,224 --> 01:47:28,193
Shit! Colonel! Colonel!

1711
01:47:38,737 --> 01:47:40,000
Colonel!

1712
01:47:40,673 --> 01:47:42,436
Shit! You all right?

1713
01:47:43,509 --> 01:47:45,677
What the hell
are you doing?

1714
01:47:45,678 --> 01:47:46,878
Take the cane.

1715
01:47:46,879 --> 01:47:47,979
I gotta take a piss.

1716
01:47:47,980 --> 01:47:49,213
Take the cane.

1717
01:47:49,214 --> 01:47:50,648
Happens to
the best of us.

1718
01:47:50,649 --> 01:47:52,684
We're on
Park Avenue.
You can't.

1719
01:47:52,685 --> 01:47:54,175
Perfect place.

1720
01:47:54,687 --> 01:47:56,421
You'll get arrested.

1721
01:47:56,422 --> 01:47:58,356
Never been
housebroken.

1722
01:47:59,458 --> 01:48:00,687
Colonel!
Shit!

1723
01:48:00,993 --> 01:48:03,553
What's the matter
with you, Colonel?

1724
01:48:09,768 --> 01:48:13,204
What are you doing?
Stand up.

1725
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:15,940
Come on.

1726
01:48:15,941 --> 01:48:18,604
I'm tired, Charlie.
I'm tired.

1727
01:48:20,713 --> 01:48:22,374
Give me your arm.

1728
01:48:23,015 --> 01:48:24,642
Here's your cane.

1729
01:48:25,985 --> 01:48:28,010
Take me back
to the hotel, son.

1730
01:48:34,226 --> 01:48:36,058
Home at last.

1731
01:48:57,383 --> 01:48:59,146
You all right now?

1732
01:49:01,053 --> 01:49:02,145
Yeah.

1733
01:49:06,125 --> 01:49:08,292
Do you want to
use the bathroom?

1734
01:49:08,293 --> 01:49:09,386
No.

1735
01:49:18,537 --> 01:49:20,004
Can I get you
something?

1736
01:49:20,005 --> 01:49:21,132
No.

1737
01:49:25,310 --> 01:49:26,811
You sure you're
all right?

1738
01:49:26,812 --> 01:49:28,473
I'm fine, Charlie.

1739
01:49:47,032 --> 01:49:49,500
Do you mind if
I use the phone?

1740
01:49:49,501 --> 01:49:50,764
Go ahead.

1741
01:50:09,922 --> 01:50:11,255
Hello?

1742
01:50:11,256 --> 01:50:13,157
Hi, is George there,
please?

1743
01:50:13,158 --> 01:50:14,819
Senior or Junior?

1744
01:50:16,328 --> 01:50:17,695
Junior.

1745
01:50:17,696 --> 01:50:19,263
Who's this?

1746
01:50:19,264 --> 01:50:20,832
A friend of his
from school.

1747
01:50:20,833 --> 01:50:24,929
Sorry, but George isn't going
to be talking to any friends
from school right now.

1748
01:50:27,239 --> 01:50:28,229
Oh.

1749
01:50:28,574 --> 01:50:29,803
Goodbye.

1750
01:50:47,226 --> 01:50:49,592
Colonel, are you
looking at me?

1751
01:50:52,331 --> 01:50:54,060
I'm blind, Charlie.

1752
01:51:00,372 --> 01:51:02,204
I'm gonna take a nap.

1753
01:51:05,010 --> 01:51:06,808
Too much fresh air.

1754
01:51:08,647 --> 01:51:10,809
It's probably a good idea.

1755
01:51:11,383 --> 01:51:13,784
Want me to help you
to your room?

1756
01:51:14,386 --> 01:51:15,444
No.

1757
01:51:16,789 --> 01:51:17,983
Couch.

1758
01:51:19,158 --> 01:51:21,058
I like this couch here.

1759
01:51:24,329 --> 01:51:26,764
You sure you're
all right, Colonel?

1760
01:51:26,765 --> 01:51:28,392
I got a headache.

1761
01:51:34,706 --> 01:51:37,975
Why don't you go
downstairs, get me
some aspirin?

1762
01:51:37,976 --> 01:51:40,946
Some aspirin.
Yeah. Also...

1763
01:51:43,782 --> 01:51:45,546
I feel like a cigar.

1764
01:51:47,085 --> 01:51:50,351
Get me a couple of
Montecristos Number One.

1765
01:51:51,557 --> 01:51:53,024
Montecristos
Number One.

1766
01:51:53,025 --> 01:51:54,192
Yeah.

1767
01:51:54,193 --> 01:51:57,094
You won't be able
to get 'em at
the newsstand downstairs.

1768
01:51:57,095 --> 01:51:59,121
So why don't you
go over to

1769
01:51:59,865 --> 01:52:02,425
50th and Fifth,
Dunhill's.

1770
01:52:03,235 --> 01:52:06,000
Fella named Arnold there,
in the humidor.

1771
01:52:06,939 --> 01:52:09,567
Tell him
they're for me.

1772
01:52:10,943 --> 01:52:12,137
He'll know.

1773
01:53:01,193 --> 01:53:03,320
You're back
too fast.

1774
01:53:06,131 --> 01:53:08,464
You didn't get
my cigars, did you?

1775
01:53:13,805 --> 01:53:15,706
Get out of
here, Charlie.

1776
01:53:20,045 --> 01:53:21,945
I thought we had a deal.

1777
01:53:22,714 --> 01:53:26,674
I welched.
I'm a welcher.
Didn't I tell you?

1778
01:53:28,220 --> 01:53:31,679
No, what you told me
was that you gave me
all the bullets.

1779
01:53:32,057 --> 01:53:33,320
I lied.

1780
01:53:35,227 --> 01:53:36,994
You could have fooled me.

1781
01:53:36,995 --> 01:53:38,361
And I did.

1782
01:53:41,266 --> 01:53:44,600
How you ever
gonna survive in this
world without me?

1783
01:53:49,474 --> 01:53:52,501
Why don't you just
give me the gun,
all right?

1784
01:54:01,420 --> 01:54:03,650
What are you doing?

1785
01:54:04,990 --> 01:54:07,049
I'm gonna
shoot you, too.

1786
01:54:10,162 --> 01:54:12,130
Your life's
finished anyway.

1787
01:54:13,365 --> 01:54:16,300
Your friend George
is going to sing
like a canary.

1788
01:54:16,301 --> 01:54:18,069
And so are you.

1789
01:54:18,070 --> 01:54:20,630
And once you've sung,
Charlie, my boy,

1790
01:54:20,906 --> 01:54:25,142
you're gonna take
your place on that
long, gray line

1791
01:54:25,143 --> 01:54:26,975
of American manhood.

1792
01:54:28,580 --> 01:54:30,776
And you will
be through.

1793
01:54:32,451 --> 01:54:34,452
I'd like to disagree
with you, Colonel.

1794
01:54:34,453 --> 01:54:36,821
You're in no
position to disagree
with me, boy.

1795
01:54:36,822 --> 01:54:40,053
I got a loaded.45 here.
You got pimples.

1796
01:54:41,059 --> 01:54:42,789
I'm gonna
kill ya, Charlie,

1797
01:54:43,528 --> 01:54:45,563
because I can't
bear the thought

1798
01:54:45,564 --> 01:54:47,259
of you sellin' out!

1799
01:54:49,234 --> 01:54:51,802
Put the gun down,
all right, Colonel?

1800
01:54:51,803 --> 01:54:54,932
What? You givin' me
an ultimatum?

1801
01:54:55,307 --> 01:54:56,672
No, I'm...

1802
01:54:58,110 --> 01:55:00,044
I give the ultimatums!

1803
01:55:01,813 --> 01:55:03,145
I'm sorry.

1804
01:55:05,083 --> 01:55:06,915
All right? I'm sorry.

1805
01:55:10,188 --> 01:55:11,747
It's all right,

1806
01:55:13,025 --> 01:55:14,458
Charlie.

1807
01:55:19,431 --> 01:55:21,331
You break
my heart, son.

1808
01:55:22,968 --> 01:55:24,800
All my life
I stood up

1809
01:55:25,804 --> 01:55:27,795
to everyone
and everything,

1810
01:55:29,274 --> 01:55:33,143
because it made me
feel important.

1811
01:55:35,347 --> 01:55:37,782
You do it
'cause you mean it.

1812
01:55:40,952 --> 01:55:42,682
You got
integrity, Charlie.

1813
01:55:46,925 --> 01:55:50,259
I don't know whether to
shoot you or adopt you.

1814
01:55:53,098 --> 01:55:55,566
Not much of a choice,
is it, sir?

1815
01:55:55,567 --> 01:55:57,365
Don't get cute now.

1816
01:55:58,136 --> 01:56:00,137
Could you please
put the gun away?

1817
01:56:00,138 --> 01:56:01,936
I asked you
a question.

1818
01:56:02,441 --> 01:56:05,342
Do you want me
to adopt you,
or don't you?

1819
01:56:06,511 --> 01:56:08,138
Please? I mean...

1820
01:56:09,748 --> 01:56:12,046
You're just in a slump
right now.

1821
01:56:12,284 --> 01:56:13,410
Slump?

1822
01:56:16,154 --> 01:56:17,918
No slump, Charlie.

1823
01:56:20,258 --> 01:56:21,521
I'm bad.

1824
01:56:24,429 --> 01:56:26,329
I'm not bad. No.

1825
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,491
I'm rotten.

1826
01:56:33,839 --> 01:56:35,431
You're not bad.

1827
01:56:38,744 --> 01:56:40,541
You're just in pain.

1828
01:56:46,218 --> 01:56:48,482
What do you know
about pain?

1829
01:56:52,257 --> 01:56:56,558
You little snail darter
from the Pacific Northwest.

1830
01:56:57,729 --> 01:56:59,697
Fuck you know
about pain?

1831
01:57:03,401 --> 01:57:05,666
Let me have the gun,
Colonel.

1832
01:57:06,104 --> 01:57:08,232
No time to grow
a dick, son.

1833
01:57:09,474 --> 01:57:12,171
Just give me the gun,
all right, Colonel?

1834
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:16,206
I'm talkin' a
parade ground.

1835
01:57:16,414 --> 01:57:17,712
Ten-hut!

1836
01:57:20,585 --> 01:57:23,817
Soldier, that was
a direct order.

1837
01:57:25,690 --> 01:57:27,317
Give me the gun.

1838
01:57:31,096 --> 01:57:33,792
You can stay or
you can leave.

1839
01:57:34,966 --> 01:57:36,767
You understand?

1840
01:57:36,768 --> 01:57:39,760
Either way, I'm gonna
do this thing.

1841
01:57:42,407 --> 01:57:46,105
Now why don't
you leave and
spare yourself?

1842
01:57:48,980 --> 01:57:50,971
I want your gun,
Colonel.

1843
01:57:59,925 --> 01:58:02,155
I'm gonna give
myself a count.

1844
01:58:07,465 --> 01:58:10,128
You need a count
for balance.

1845
01:58:13,438 --> 01:58:14,838
Five...

1846
01:58:16,007 --> 01:58:16,997
Four...

1847
01:58:19,044 --> 01:58:20,477
Three...

1848
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:23,709
Two...

1849
01:58:26,351 --> 01:58:27,477
One...

1850
01:58:29,621 --> 01:58:30,747
Fuck it.

1851
01:58:38,463 --> 01:58:40,193
Give me! Fuck!

1852
01:58:43,501 --> 01:58:44,668
Get out of here!

1853
01:58:44,669 --> 01:58:46,070
I'm stayin' right here!

1854
01:58:46,071 --> 01:58:47,371
Get outta here!

1855
01:58:47,372 --> 01:58:48,772
I'm stayin' right here.

1856
01:58:48,773 --> 01:58:50,507
I'll blow your
fuckin' head off!

1857
01:58:50,508 --> 01:58:52,142
Then do it!

1858
01:58:52,143 --> 01:58:54,669
You want to do it?
Do it! Let's go.

1859
01:59:00,752 --> 01:59:02,811
Get outta here!

1860
01:59:04,189 --> 01:59:06,624
You fucked up,
all right? So what?

1861
01:59:06,625 --> 01:59:08,491
So everybody does it.

1862
01:59:09,127 --> 01:59:10,895
Get on with your life,
would ya?

1863
01:59:10,896 --> 01:59:12,227
What life?

1864
01:59:13,298 --> 01:59:15,323
I got no life!

1865
01:59:17,469 --> 01:59:19,562
I'm in the dark here!

1866
01:59:21,273 --> 01:59:22,797
You understand?

1867
01:59:24,142 --> 01:59:25,701
I'm in the dark!

1868
01:59:31,383 --> 01:59:32,816
So give up.

1869
01:59:33,652 --> 01:59:37,221
You want to give up, give up.
Because I'm givin' up, too.

1870
01:59:37,222 --> 01:59:39,657
You said I'm through.
You're right,
I am through.

1871
01:59:39,658 --> 01:59:41,751
We're both through.
It's all over.

1872
01:59:42,360 --> 01:59:44,695
So let's get on with it.
Let's fuckin' do it.

1873
01:59:44,696 --> 01:59:46,926
Let's fuckin'
pull the trigger,

1874
01:59:47,565 --> 01:59:49,830
you miserable
blind motherfucker.

1875
01:59:58,176 --> 01:59:59,837
Pull the trigger.

1876
02:00:01,880 --> 02:00:03,677
Here we go, Charlie.

1877
02:00:05,050 --> 02:00:06,381
I'm ready.

1878
02:00:14,326 --> 02:00:16,191
You don't want to die.

1879
02:00:18,663 --> 02:00:20,461
And neither do you.

1880
02:00:23,902 --> 02:00:26,564
Give me one
reason not to.

1881
02:00:31,042 --> 02:00:32,271
I'll give you two.

1882
02:00:32,711 --> 02:00:36,272
You can dance the tango
and drive a Ferrari better
than anyone I've ever seen.

1883
02:00:42,654 --> 02:00:45,089
You never seen
anyone do either.

1884
02:00:49,260 --> 02:00:51,388
Give me the gun,
Colonel.

1885
02:01:02,307 --> 02:01:05,037
Where do I go
from here, Charlie?

1886
02:01:06,544 --> 02:01:09,241
If you're tangled up,
just tango on.

1887
02:01:11,950 --> 02:01:14,248
You askin' me
to dance, Charlie?

1888
02:01:21,559 --> 02:01:24,361
Did you ever
have the feelin'

1889
02:01:24,362 --> 02:01:26,228
That you wanted to go

1890
02:01:27,932 --> 02:01:32,370
And still had the feelin'
that you wanted to stay?

1891
02:01:48,887 --> 02:01:50,946
You like my blues,
Charlie?

1892
02:01:54,325 --> 02:01:56,351
Yeah, they're beautiful.

1893
02:01:57,695 --> 02:01:59,322
I wore these

1894
02:02:01,166 --> 02:02:03,066
for Lyndon's
inauguration.

1895
02:02:05,570 --> 02:02:09,700
Of course, we weren't
the number one ball.

1896
02:02:13,278 --> 02:02:15,269
But he dropped by
anyway.

1897
02:02:17,949 --> 02:02:20,213
Will you please
give me the gun?

1898
02:02:24,222 --> 02:02:26,156
You're askin' an officer

1899
02:02:27,292 --> 02:02:29,852
to surrender his sidearm.

1900
02:02:31,262 --> 02:02:33,297
You don't have
to surrender it.

1901
02:02:33,298 --> 02:02:35,664
Just put it down
for a little while.

1902
02:02:36,534 --> 02:02:38,696
All right?
Just put it down.

1903
02:02:50,448 --> 02:02:52,917
Boy, I could use
a drink, Charlie.

1904
02:02:56,454 --> 02:02:58,548
How about a cup of coffee?

1905
02:03:01,159 --> 02:03:04,428
Too big a leap for me
right now, Charlie.

1906
02:03:04,429 --> 02:03:05,929
Maybe tomorrow.

1907
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:13,066
No, a Mr. John Daniels
would be preferred.

1908
02:03:15,807 --> 02:03:17,468
No water,
Charlie.

1909
02:03:20,111 --> 02:03:21,408
No water.

1910
02:03:22,180 --> 02:03:23,443
Please.

1911
02:03:31,489 --> 02:03:33,480
Here's your drink,
Colonel.

1912
02:03:40,131 --> 02:03:42,122
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1913
02:03:42,934 --> 02:03:45,602
What time do you want me
to turn down the bed?

1914
02:03:45,603 --> 02:03:47,638
Maybe later,
all right?

1915
02:03:47,639 --> 02:03:49,607
What he means,
se·orita,

1916
02:03:50,775 --> 02:03:52,675
is come right in.

1917
02:03:56,214 --> 02:03:57,682
Later, please?

1918
02:03:58,750 --> 02:04:01,082
Yes, sir.
Good afternoon.

1919
02:04:05,757 --> 02:04:07,247
Nice voice.

1920
02:04:11,563 --> 02:04:13,963
Boy, you have
a one-track mind.

1921
02:04:15,934 --> 02:04:18,960
Is there anything else
in this world, Charlie?

1922
02:04:20,171 --> 02:04:21,696
Not for you.

1923
02:04:22,774 --> 02:04:25,868
You know what's
kept me goin'
all these years?

1924
02:04:26,578 --> 02:04:28,239
The thought

1925
02:04:29,547 --> 02:04:31,982
that one day...

1926
02:04:40,892 --> 02:04:42,189
Never mind.

1927
02:04:43,428 --> 02:04:44,725
The what?

1928
02:04:46,564 --> 02:04:47,929
Silly.

1929
02:04:50,802 --> 02:04:53,601
Just the thought that
maybe one day, I'd...

1930
02:04:57,609 --> 02:05:00,510
I could have a woman's arms
wrapped around me,

1931
02:05:02,347 --> 02:05:04,611
and her legs
wrapped around me.

1932
02:05:07,385 --> 02:05:08,682
And what?

1933
02:05:13,524 --> 02:05:17,985
That I could wake up
in the morning and
she'd still be there.

1934
02:05:19,397 --> 02:05:20,922
Smell of her.

1935
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:24,129
All funky and warm.

1936
02:05:28,840 --> 02:05:30,740
I finally gave up on it.

1937
02:05:34,012 --> 02:05:36,537
I don't know why
you can't have that.

1938
02:05:39,584 --> 02:05:42,152
When we get back
to New Hampshire,

1939
02:05:42,153 --> 02:05:44,713
I don't know why you
can't find someone.

1940
02:05:45,023 --> 02:05:48,049
You're a good-lookin' guy

1941
02:05:48,626 --> 02:05:50,651
and you're fun to be with

1942
02:05:51,462 --> 02:05:54,398
and you're a great
travel companion,

1943
02:05:54,966 --> 02:05:57,560
sensitive, compassionate.

1944
02:06:01,639 --> 02:06:02,800
Charlie,

1945
02:06:04,175 --> 02:06:06,234
are you fuckin' with me?

1946
02:06:10,315 --> 02:06:11,441
Yes.

1947
02:06:15,887 --> 02:06:17,116
Yeah?

1948
02:06:17,922 --> 02:06:19,356
Hey, Manny.

1949
02:06:24,595 --> 02:06:25,929
We missed our plane.

1950
02:06:25,930 --> 02:06:28,065
Your plane, Charlie.

1951
02:06:28,066 --> 02:06:29,863
My ticket was one-way.

1952
02:06:31,869 --> 02:06:34,137
New England thruway
all the way, Colonel?

1953
02:06:34,138 --> 02:06:35,970
All the way,
Manolo.

1954
02:06:48,152 --> 02:06:51,145
I'm gettin' that heavy
feelin' again, Charlie.

1955
02:06:52,957 --> 02:06:54,084
Uh...

1956
02:06:54,992 --> 02:06:56,187
"Uh..."

1957
02:06:57,228 --> 02:07:00,391
I think you were
right about George
and his father.

1958
02:07:00,798 --> 02:07:02,833
I'm sorry
to hear that.

1959
02:07:02,834 --> 02:07:07,671
When we get back Mr. Trask
is bringing us up
in front of the whole school.

1960
02:07:07,672 --> 02:07:10,040
Puttin' your feet
to the fire?

1961
02:07:10,041 --> 02:07:12,874
Special meeting of the
disciplinary committee.

1962
02:07:14,479 --> 02:07:16,845
And what are you
gonna tell 'em?

1963
02:07:19,717 --> 02:07:22,243
I don't know.
I'll think of somethin'.

1964
02:07:24,155 --> 02:07:27,784
Charlie, why are you
all alone in this thing?

1965
02:07:29,861 --> 02:07:31,624
Where's your father?

1966
02:07:33,197 --> 02:07:34,688
He left.

1967
02:07:36,134 --> 02:07:40,366
I thought it was a
mom-and-pop store.
Who's the pop?

1968
02:07:40,905 --> 02:07:42,600
It's my stepfather.

1969
02:07:43,608 --> 02:07:45,474
Oh, yeah.

1970
02:07:47,578 --> 02:07:51,242
But why isn't
he in on this?
Somethin' wrong with him?

1971
02:07:52,583 --> 02:07:55,109
No, he's okay. We just...

1972
02:07:55,553 --> 02:07:57,220
We don't get along
very well.

1973
02:07:57,221 --> 02:07:58,518
Why not?

1974
02:08:00,258 --> 02:08:01,792
Because he's
an asshole.

1975
02:08:06,464 --> 02:08:09,729
Well, that's
all right, Charlie.

1976
02:08:11,936 --> 02:08:14,803
Every family's
got one nowadays.

1977
02:08:44,702 --> 02:08:46,033
That's it?

1978
02:08:46,370 --> 02:08:47,504
That's it.

1979
02:08:47,505 --> 02:08:48,972
Take care of
yourself, kid.

1980
02:08:48,973 --> 02:08:50,839
All right, Manny.
Thanks.

1981
02:08:56,681 --> 02:08:58,672
No,
I'm not opening.

1982
02:09:00,284 --> 02:09:01,843
I hate goodbyes.

1983
02:09:04,455 --> 02:09:06,014
So...

1984
02:09:06,791 --> 02:09:08,418
You'll be
all right, huh?

1985
02:09:09,794 --> 02:09:11,284
I'll be fine.

1986
02:09:12,797 --> 02:09:14,094
All right.

1987
02:09:17,401 --> 02:09:18,960
What's that?

1988
02:09:19,904 --> 02:09:21,633
That's first bell.

1989
02:09:23,307 --> 02:09:25,742
Just got time
to get cleaned up.

1990
02:09:29,113 --> 02:09:30,843
I almost forgot.

1991
02:09:35,119 --> 02:09:37,087
I owe you
some money.

1992
02:09:39,423 --> 02:09:42,586
$300.
Job well done.

1993
02:09:46,797 --> 02:09:49,596
You ever need
any references, Charlie,
I'm your man.

1994
02:09:51,736 --> 02:09:53,363
Thanks, Colonel.

1995
02:10:00,144 --> 02:10:03,213
16 Water Street.
Over the bridge.

1996
02:10:03,214 --> 02:10:04,704
We'll find it.

1997
02:10:05,750 --> 02:10:07,479
Goodbye, Charlie.

1998
02:10:09,186 --> 02:10:10,916
Goodbye, Colonel.

1999
02:10:14,025 --> 02:10:15,652
Come here, son.

2000
02:10:32,410 --> 02:10:33,775
Okay, Manny.

2001
02:11:47,985 --> 02:11:49,954
George. George!

2002
02:12:29,126 --> 02:12:31,961
I called an open meeting
of this institution
this morning

2003
02:12:31,962 --> 02:12:35,265
because the incident
that occurred this
Tuesday last

2004
02:12:35,266 --> 02:12:39,362
describes an issue
that concerns all of us.

2005
02:12:40,805 --> 02:12:43,039
Not an isolated case
of vandalism.

2006
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:44,641
What happened

2007
02:12:44,642 --> 02:12:48,271
is a symptom
of the sickness
of a society.

2008
02:12:49,246 --> 02:12:54,480
A sickness which runs
counter to the principles
this school was founded on.

2009
02:12:56,687 --> 02:12:59,089
A school among
whose graduates

2010
02:12:59,090 --> 02:13:03,857
two have sat behind the
desk in the Oval O·ce,
in the White House.

2011
02:13:04,962 --> 02:13:08,296
Baird men have
run State Departments
and investment houses,

2012
02:13:09,066 --> 02:13:12,235
founded department stores
and coached football teams.

2013
02:13:12,236 --> 02:13:15,672
Our alumni receive
their bulletins in
ashrams in India

2014
02:13:16,140 --> 02:13:18,041
and in palaces in Jordan.

2015
02:13:18,042 --> 02:13:20,543
We are, in fact,
known around the world

2016
02:13:20,544 --> 02:13:23,713
as the cradle of this
country's leadership.

2017
02:13:23,714 --> 02:13:25,749
A beacon in the...
What are you doing here?

2018
02:13:25,750 --> 02:13:27,617
Got room for me
up there, Charlie?

2019
02:13:27,618 --> 02:13:30,720
But today we are bleeding
from disrespect.

2020
02:13:30,721 --> 02:13:31,988
Yeah, I guess so.

2021
02:13:31,989 --> 02:13:33,857
Blatant disrespect.
Give us a hand.

2022
02:13:33,858 --> 02:13:36,092
A disrespect
for our values,

2023
02:13:36,093 --> 02:13:39,963
and a disrespect
for our standards.

2024
02:13:39,964 --> 02:13:43,433
A disrespect for
the Baird tradition.

2025
02:13:43,434 --> 02:13:46,199
And, as the custodians
of that tradition,

2026
02:13:47,338 --> 02:13:51,536
we are here today
to protect each other

2027
02:13:52,109 --> 02:13:54,601
from those who threaten it.

2028
02:13:55,780 --> 02:13:57,714
Who is this, Mr. Simms?

2029
02:13:59,917 --> 02:14:01,851
This is Mr. Frank Slade,

2030
02:14:02,653 --> 02:14:05,884
Lieutenant Colonel,
United States Army,
retired.

2031
02:14:07,191 --> 02:14:09,523
I'm here in place
of Charlie's parents.

2032
02:14:09,793 --> 02:14:11,125
Excuse me?

2033
02:14:11,395 --> 02:14:13,022
In loco parentis.

2034
02:14:15,366 --> 02:14:18,635
They could not make
the trip from
Oregon today.

2035
02:14:18,636 --> 02:14:21,671
And what is your
relationship to Mr. Simms?

2036
02:14:21,672 --> 02:14:23,436
Is this a
courtroom?

2037
02:14:24,375 --> 02:14:26,409
Closest thing
we could manage to it.

2038
02:14:26,410 --> 02:14:30,074
Then if we're taking oaths,
there's a few people
I'd like to swear in.

2039
02:14:32,416 --> 02:14:34,612
There are no oaths
at Baird.

2040
02:14:35,686 --> 02:14:37,677
We are all on our honor.

2041
02:14:39,657 --> 02:14:42,057
Larry and Franny Simms

2042
02:14:42,426 --> 02:14:44,918
are very dear,
close friends of mine.

2043
02:14:45,396 --> 02:14:48,593
They've asked me
to appear here on
Charlie's behalf.

2044
02:14:49,533 --> 02:14:50,728
Okay?

2045
02:14:53,270 --> 02:14:55,705
Happy to have you
with us, Colonel.

2046
02:14:59,944 --> 02:15:01,275
Mr. Willis.

2047
02:15:03,681 --> 02:15:05,415
Which Mr. Willis?

2048
02:15:05,416 --> 02:15:06,849
George, Junior, sir.

2049
02:15:11,889 --> 02:15:13,489
Yes.

2050
02:15:13,490 --> 02:15:15,592
You were in a position
last Tuesday night

2051
02:15:15,593 --> 02:15:19,086
to see who committed
this act of vandalism.
Who was it?

2052
02:15:21,799 --> 02:15:25,134
Well, I have an idea
who it was.

2053
02:15:25,135 --> 02:15:26,769
No, not an idea,
Mr. Willis.

2054
02:15:26,770 --> 02:15:28,602
Did you see or
did you not see?

2055
02:15:31,609 --> 02:15:32,940
Well...

2056
02:15:34,712 --> 02:15:37,044
I didn't have
my contacts in.

2057
02:15:41,118 --> 02:15:42,347
Come on.

2058
02:15:46,223 --> 02:15:49,359
I was in the library.
I'd taken my glasses off,

2059
02:15:49,360 --> 02:15:51,954
and I was gonna put
my contacts back in.

2060
02:15:57,368 --> 02:15:59,168
Then I helped
Simms close up

2061
02:15:59,169 --> 02:16:02,171
and the next thing
I know, we're outside,

2062
02:16:02,172 --> 02:16:04,232
and I hear
this sound and I

2063
02:16:06,377 --> 02:16:09,244
didn't have any time
to put my contacts in.

2064
02:16:09,847 --> 02:16:12,543
Whom, with your
limited vision,
did you see?

2065
02:16:30,134 --> 02:16:32,261
Like I say,
it was blurry.

2066
02:16:38,142 --> 02:16:40,777
I can't see
without my contacts.

2067
02:16:40,778 --> 02:16:43,178
What did you see,
Mr. Willis?

2068
02:16:43,514 --> 02:16:44,708
What?

2069
02:16:45,783 --> 02:16:47,183
You mean definitively?

2070
02:16:47,184 --> 02:16:49,018
Stop fencing with me,
Mr. Willis!

2071
02:16:49,019 --> 02:16:50,919
Tell me what you saw!

2072
02:16:56,060 --> 02:17:00,292
Now, don't hold me to this,
but no contacts, it's dark...

2073
02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:04,334
And everything, I mean...

2074
02:17:04,335 --> 02:17:05,734
Mr. Willis!

2075
02:17:08,906 --> 02:17:09,998
Maybe...

2076
02:17:12,476 --> 02:17:14,376
Harry Havemeyer,

2077
02:17:15,179 --> 02:17:18,171
Trent Potter and
Jimmy Jameson.

2078
02:17:22,353 --> 02:17:23,553
Maybe?

2079
02:17:23,554 --> 02:17:25,249
Ballpark, best guess.

2080
02:17:27,458 --> 02:17:30,222
Could you provide us
with some detaiI?

2081
02:17:32,830 --> 02:17:36,323
Why don't you ask Charlie?
I really think he was closer.

2082
02:17:45,275 --> 02:17:46,607
Mr. Simms.

2083
02:17:48,178 --> 02:17:49,679
Yes.

2084
02:17:49,680 --> 02:17:52,448
You don't wear contact lenses,
do you?

2085
02:17:52,449 --> 02:17:53,746
No, sir.

2086
02:17:55,519 --> 02:17:58,354
With your
untrammeled sight,

2087
02:17:58,355 --> 02:17:59,755
w£om did you see?

2088
02:18:03,894 --> 02:18:05,692
Well, I saw something,

2089
02:18:07,664 --> 02:18:10,133
but I couldn't say who.

2090
02:18:10,868 --> 02:18:13,769
All right. What was
the something you saw?

2091
02:18:17,674 --> 02:18:18,775
I couldn't say.

2092
02:18:18,776 --> 02:18:20,505
You couldn't or wouldn't say?

2093
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:24,805
Well, I just...

2094
02:18:28,786 --> 02:18:30,153
I just couldn't say.

2095
02:18:30,154 --> 02:18:31,821
Couldn't, wouldn't, shouldn't.

2096
02:18:31,822 --> 02:18:35,291
You're exhausting my patience
and making a mockery
of these proceedings.

2097
02:18:35,292 --> 02:18:37,060
I will give you
one last chance.

2098
02:18:37,061 --> 02:18:39,629
The consequences
of your response
will be dire.

2099
02:18:39,630 --> 02:18:43,965
By dire, I mean
your future will be
jeopardized permanently.

2100
02:18:45,602 --> 02:18:47,503
Now for the last time,

2101
02:18:47,504 --> 02:18:51,873
w£at did you see
last Tuesday night
outside my office?

2102
02:18:56,046 --> 02:18:57,880
I saw somebody.

2103
02:18:57,881 --> 02:19:00,043
"I saw somebody." Good.

2104
02:19:01,251 --> 02:19:03,618
Did you see their
size and shape?

2105
02:19:05,089 --> 02:19:06,386
Yeah.

2106
02:19:07,157 --> 02:19:09,820
And they were the size
and shape of whom?

2107
02:19:15,299 --> 02:19:17,358
They were the size and shape

2108
02:19:32,449 --> 02:19:34,611
of most any
Baird student, sir.

2109
02:19:49,733 --> 02:19:51,997
I am left with
no real witness.

2110
02:19:53,770 --> 02:19:57,773
Mr. Willis' testimony
is not only vague,
it is unsubstantiated.

2111
02:19:57,774 --> 02:20:00,676
The substance I was
looking for, Mr. Simms,

2112
02:20:00,677 --> 02:20:02,475
was to come from you.

2113
02:20:06,149 --> 02:20:07,515
I'm sorry.

2114
02:20:09,086 --> 02:20:11,145
I'm sorry, too, Mr. Simms,

2115
02:20:12,022 --> 02:20:13,990
because you know
what I'm going to do

2116
02:20:13,991 --> 02:20:16,659
inasmuch as I can't
punish Mr. Havemeyer

2117
02:20:16,660 --> 02:20:18,928
Mr. Potter or Mr. Jameson?

2118
02:20:18,929 --> 02:20:20,988
And I won't punish
Mr. Willis.

2119
02:20:21,565 --> 02:20:23,566
He's the only party
to this incident

2120
02:20:23,567 --> 02:20:26,537
w£o is still worthy
of calling himself
a Baird man.

2121
02:20:27,804 --> 02:20:30,967
I'm going to recommend to
the disciplinary committee

2122
02:20:32,809 --> 02:20:34,810
that you be expelled.

2123
02:20:34,811 --> 02:20:39,048
Mr. Simms, you are
a cover-up artist
and you are a liar.

2124
02:20:39,049 --> 02:20:40,983
But not a snitch!

2125
02:20:42,486 --> 02:20:44,053
Excuse me?

2126
02:20:44,054 --> 02:20:45,721
No, I don't think
I will.

2127
02:20:45,722 --> 02:20:47,156
Mr. Slade.

2128
02:20:47,157 --> 02:20:49,626
This is such
a crock of shit!

2129
02:20:51,028 --> 02:20:53,262
Please watch
your language, Mr. Slade.

2130
02:20:53,263 --> 02:20:56,165
You are in the Baird school,
not a barracks.

2131
02:20:56,600 --> 02:20:59,569
Mr. Simms, I will
give you one final
opportunity to speak up.

2132
02:20:59,570 --> 02:21:01,663
Mr. Simms
doesn't want it.

2133
02:21:02,406 --> 02:21:04,006
He doesn't need
to be labeled

2134
02:21:04,007 --> 02:21:06,374
"still worthy of
being a Baird man."

2135
02:21:06,910 --> 02:21:08,911
What the hell is that?

2136
02:21:08,912 --> 02:21:11,047
What is your motto here?

2137
02:21:11,048 --> 02:21:15,218
"Boys, inform on
your classmates,
save your hide,

2138
02:21:15,219 --> 02:21:18,654
"anything short of that,
we're gonna burn you
at the stake?"

2139
02:21:18,655 --> 02:21:20,923
Well, gentlemen,

2140
02:21:20,924 --> 02:21:24,360
when the shit hits the fan,
some guys run,

2141
02:21:24,361 --> 02:21:26,095
and some guys stay.

2142
02:21:26,096 --> 02:21:29,632
Here's Charlie,
facin' the fire,
and there's George,

2143
02:21:29,633 --> 02:21:32,201
hidin' in big daddy's pocket.

2144
02:21:32,202 --> 02:21:33,936
And what are you doin'?

2145
02:21:33,937 --> 02:21:37,874
You're gonna reward George
and destroy Charlie.

2146
02:21:39,643 --> 02:21:41,210
Are you finished,
Mr. Slade?

2147
02:21:41,211 --> 02:21:43,339
No, I'm just gettin'
warmed up.

2148
02:21:44,414 --> 02:21:46,515
I don't know
who went to
this place.

2149
02:21:46,516 --> 02:21:51,287
William Howard Taft,
William Jennings Bryan,
William Tell, whoever.

2150
02:21:51,288 --> 02:21:54,657
Their spirit is dead,
if they ever had one.

2151
02:21:54,658 --> 02:21:56,058
It's gone.

2152
02:21:56,059 --> 02:21:59,028
You're buildin'
a rat ship here,

2153
02:21:59,029 --> 02:22:02,031
a vessel for
seagoin' snitches.

2154
02:22:02,032 --> 02:22:05,868
And if you think
you're preparin' these
minnows for manhood,

2155
02:22:05,869 --> 02:22:07,503
you better think again,

2156
02:22:07,504 --> 02:22:10,406
because I say you are
killin' the very spirit

2157
02:22:10,407 --> 02:22:13,672
this institution
proclaims it instills.

2158
02:22:14,511 --> 02:22:16,212
What a sham.

2159
02:22:16,213 --> 02:22:19,215
What kind of a show
are you guys puttin'
on here today?

2160
02:22:19,216 --> 02:22:22,785
The only class
in this act is
sittin' next to me.

2161
02:22:22,786 --> 02:22:26,555
And I'm here
to tell you this boy's
soul is intact.

2162
02:22:26,556 --> 02:22:29,392
It's non-negotiable.
You know how I know?

2163
02:22:29,393 --> 02:22:33,056
Someone here,
and I won't say who,
offered to buy it.

2164
02:22:33,497 --> 02:22:35,598
Only Charlie
here wasn't sellin'.

2165
02:22:35,599 --> 02:22:37,133
Sir, you're
out of order.

2166
02:22:37,134 --> 02:22:39,468
I'd show you
out of order.

2167
02:22:39,469 --> 02:22:42,538
You don't know what
out of order is,
Mr. Trask.

2168
02:22:42,539 --> 02:22:44,774
I'd show you,
but I'm too old,

2169
02:22:44,775 --> 02:22:47,376
I'm too tired,
I'm too fuckin' blind.

2170
02:22:47,377 --> 02:22:52,816
If I were the man I was
five years ago, I'd take
a flamethrower to this place!

2171
02:22:55,919 --> 02:22:59,048
Out of order? Who the hell
you think you're talkin' to?

2172
02:23:00,657 --> 02:23:02,785
I've been around, you know?

2173
02:23:03,460 --> 02:23:05,656
There was a time
I could see.

2174
02:23:06,129 --> 02:23:07,722
And I have seen.

2175
02:23:08,298 --> 02:23:10,700
Boys like these,
younger than these,

2176
02:23:10,701 --> 02:23:14,034
their arms torn out,
their legs ripped off.

2177
02:23:14,604 --> 02:23:17,773
But there is nothin'
like the sight

2178
02:23:17,774 --> 02:23:19,675
of an amputated spirit.

2179
02:23:19,676 --> 02:23:22,543
There is no prosthetic
for that.

2180
02:23:24,281 --> 02:23:27,850
You think you're merely
sendin' this splendid
foot soldier

2181
02:23:27,851 --> 02:23:31,120
back home to Oregon with
his tail between his legs,

2182
02:23:31,121 --> 02:23:35,058
but I say you are
executin' his soul!

2183
02:23:36,326 --> 02:23:37,657
And why?

2184
02:23:38,595 --> 02:23:40,962
Because he's not
a Baird man.

2185
02:23:41,631 --> 02:23:44,567
Baird men.
You hurt this boy,

2186
02:23:44,568 --> 02:23:47,333
you're gonna be Baird bums,
the lot of you.

2187
02:23:47,504 --> 02:23:49,768
And, Harry, Jimmy,

2188
02:23:50,607 --> 02:23:53,376
Trent, wherever you are
out there,

2189
02:23:53,377 --> 02:23:54,935
fuck you, too!

2190
02:23:57,547 --> 02:23:59,515
Stand down, Mr. Slade!

2191
02:23:59,516 --> 02:24:01,006
I'm not finished.

2192
02:24:02,219 --> 02:24:06,522
As I came in here,
I heard those words,

2193
02:24:06,523 --> 02:24:08,491
"cradle of leadership."

2194
02:24:09,726 --> 02:24:15,197
Well, "when the bough breaks,
the cradle will fall,"
and it has fallen here.

2195
02:24:15,198 --> 02:24:16,899
It has fallen.

2196
02:24:16,900 --> 02:24:20,002
Makers of men,
creators of leaders.

2197
02:24:20,003 --> 02:24:23,371
Be careful what
kind of leaders
you're producin' here.

2198
02:24:24,341 --> 02:24:28,544
I don't know if Charlie's
silence here today
is right or wrong.

2199
02:24:28,545 --> 02:24:30,146
I'm not a judge orjury.

2200
02:24:30,147 --> 02:24:32,014
But I can tell you this,

2201
02:24:32,015 --> 02:24:35,781
he won't sell anybody out
to buy his future!

2202
02:24:37,053 --> 02:24:40,251
And that, my friends,
is called integrity.

2203
02:24:41,191 --> 02:24:43,192
That's called courage.

2204
02:24:43,193 --> 02:24:46,356
Now that's the stuff
leaders should be made of.

2205
02:24:51,902 --> 02:24:55,429
Now I have come to
the crossroads in my life.

2206
02:24:56,573 --> 02:24:59,907
I always knew what
the right path was.

2207
02:25:00,911 --> 02:25:04,278
Without exception, I knew,
but I never took it.

2208
02:25:04,748 --> 02:25:06,238
You know why?

2209
02:25:06,883 --> 02:25:09,853
It was too damn hard.

2210
02:25:11,488 --> 02:25:14,657
Now here's Charlie.
He's come to
the crossroads.

2211
02:25:14,658 --> 02:25:18,117
He has chosen a path.
It's the right path.

2212
02:25:19,129 --> 02:25:22,792
It's a path made of principle
that leads to character.

2213
02:25:25,802 --> 02:25:28,203
Let him continue
on his journey.

2214
02:25:30,307 --> 02:25:33,766
You hold this boy's future
in your hands, committee.

2215
02:25:35,011 --> 02:25:37,680
It's a valuable future,

2216
02:25:37,681 --> 02:25:39,012
believe me.

2217
02:25:39,783 --> 02:25:42,479
Don't destroy it.
Protect it.

2218
02:25:44,154 --> 02:25:45,553
Embrace it.

2219
02:25:46,289 --> 02:25:49,452
It's gonna make you
proud one day,
I promise you.

2220
02:26:07,043 --> 02:26:08,978
How's that
for cornball?

2221
02:26:30,533 --> 02:26:32,593
Nothing can
shut them up, sir.

2222
02:26:37,107 --> 02:26:40,342
The disciplinary
committee will take
this matter under advisement

2223
02:26:40,343 --> 02:26:42,539
in closed session.

2224
02:26:50,554 --> 02:26:52,749
What are they doin',
Charlie?

2225
02:26:53,556 --> 02:26:56,720
I think they're
going to come to
a decision now.

2226
02:27:00,030 --> 02:27:01,361
Very well.

2227
02:27:06,870 --> 02:27:09,737
Apparently, that meeting
will be unnecessary.

2228
02:27:10,540 --> 02:27:12,031
Mrs. Hunsaker.

2229
02:27:16,246 --> 02:27:21,550
The joint student-faculty
disciplinary committee
needs no further sessions.

2230
02:27:21,551 --> 02:27:24,253
They have come to a decision.

2231
02:27:24,254 --> 02:27:26,889
Messrs. Havemeyer,
Potter and Jameson

2232
02:27:26,890 --> 02:27:28,790
are placed on probation

2233
02:27:29,326 --> 02:27:32,295
for suspicion of
ungentlemanly conduct.

2234
02:27:32,562 --> 02:27:35,931
It is further recommended
that Mr. George Willis, Jr.

2235
02:27:35,932 --> 02:27:39,201
Receive neither recognition
nor commendation

2236
02:27:39,202 --> 02:27:41,000
for his cooperation.

2237
02:27:42,439 --> 02:27:44,707
Mr. Charles Simms is excused

2238
02:27:44,708 --> 02:27:47,476
from any further response
to this incident.

2239
02:27:47,477 --> 02:27:48,577
Hoo-ah!

2240
02:28:26,650 --> 02:28:28,242
Charlie!

2241
02:28:48,238 --> 02:28:49,538
Last step.

2242
02:28:49,539 --> 02:28:51,803
I can always count
on you, Charlie.

2243
02:28:55,011 --> 02:28:56,479
Colonel!

2244
02:29:00,050 --> 02:29:01,950
I'm Christine Downes,
Colonel Slade.

2245
02:29:01,951 --> 02:29:03,685
I teach
political science.

2246
02:29:03,686 --> 02:29:07,156
I wanted to tell you
how much I appreciate
you speaking your mind.

2247
02:29:07,157 --> 02:29:09,023
Why, thank you.
Are you married?

2248
02:29:09,659 --> 02:29:11,093
I...

2249
02:29:13,997 --> 02:29:17,633
Went to an artillery school
at Fort Sill with
a Mickey Downes.

2250
02:29:17,634 --> 02:29:19,401
Thought he might've
snagged you.

2251
02:29:19,402 --> 02:29:21,564
No, I'm afraid not.

2252
02:29:23,239 --> 02:29:27,142
Colonel Slade was on
Lyndon Johnson's staff,
Miss Downes.

2253
02:29:27,143 --> 02:29:29,511
Were you? Fascinating.

2254
02:29:29,512 --> 02:29:32,209
We should get together,
talk politics sometime.

2255
02:29:36,119 --> 02:29:37,951
Fleurs de Rocaille.

2256
02:29:39,656 --> 02:29:40,782
Yes.

2257
02:29:42,392 --> 02:29:44,485
"Flowers from a brook."

2258
02:29:46,062 --> 02:29:47,496
That's right.

2259
02:29:51,301 --> 02:29:55,135
Well, Miss Downes,
I'll know where to find you.

2260
02:29:57,307 --> 02:29:58,807
Charlie.

2261
02:29:58,808 --> 02:30:00,242
Bye, Miss Downes.

2262
02:30:00,243 --> 02:30:01,472
Bye.

2263
02:30:04,748 --> 02:30:07,273
You don't have to
tell me, Charlie.

2264
02:30:07,851 --> 02:30:08,977
5'7",

2265
02:30:10,587 --> 02:30:12,350
auburn hair,

2266
02:30:13,323 --> 02:30:15,814
beautiful brown eyes.

2267
02:30:34,410 --> 02:30:36,072
Yabba-dabba-doo.

2268
02:30:40,884 --> 02:30:42,044
Manny.

2269
02:30:44,754 --> 02:30:46,321
Colonel, this
is too much.

2270
02:30:46,322 --> 02:30:47,856
Never mind,
you earned it.

2271
02:30:47,857 --> 02:30:49,458
Next time Charlie and I

2272
02:30:49,459 --> 02:30:52,528
want to take a
breather to New York,
we're gonna call you.

2273
02:30:52,529 --> 02:30:54,296
You can drive us
both ways.

2274
02:30:54,297 --> 02:30:55,731
You're on,
Colonel.

2275
02:30:55,732 --> 02:30:57,499
Not only will it
be an honor,

2276
02:30:57,500 --> 02:30:58,834
I'll give you
a rate.

2277
02:30:58,835 --> 02:31:01,537
I'll see your rate
and raise you.

2278
02:31:01,538 --> 02:31:03,372
Stay outta
harm's way, Manny.

2279
02:31:03,373 --> 02:31:04,573
Take care,
Colonel.

2280
02:31:04,574 --> 02:31:05,871
You, too.

2281
02:31:06,643 --> 02:31:09,112
Ready?
No. I'll take it
from here.

2282
02:31:10,213 --> 02:31:11,647
You go on ahead.

2283
02:31:11,648 --> 02:31:13,912
Manny'll drive you
to your dorm.

2284
02:31:15,351 --> 02:31:18,053
Come by before you
go home for Christmas.

2285
02:31:18,054 --> 02:31:20,322
We'll have a little cheer.

2286
02:31:20,323 --> 02:31:22,891
And if you like,
stay for dinner.

2287
02:31:22,892 --> 02:31:25,928
Sometimes she cooks
a pot roast.

2288
02:31:25,929 --> 02:31:27,590
It's almost edible.

2289
02:31:29,065 --> 02:31:31,700
All right, Colonel.
That'd be really...

2290
02:31:31,701 --> 02:31:33,169
Bye, Charlie.

2291
02:31:53,089 --> 02:31:56,825
Who's there?
That you, Francine?

2292
02:31:56,826 --> 02:31:57,893
Yes.

2293
02:31:57,894 --> 02:31:59,194
What are you doing?

2294
02:31:59,195 --> 02:32:01,230
Taking a ride.

2295
02:32:01,231 --> 02:32:02,965
Taking a ride?

2296
02:32:02,966 --> 02:32:05,400
What about you
giving me a lift?

2297
02:32:05,401 --> 02:32:06,602
No.

2298
02:32:06,603 --> 02:32:07,729
No?

2299
02:32:08,238 --> 02:32:10,001
Come on, Francine.

2300
02:32:10,540 --> 02:32:13,532
We should make up.
Don't you think
it's time we made up?

2301
02:32:14,043 --> 02:32:15,410
No.

2302
02:32:15,411 --> 02:32:17,145
Francine?
What?

2303
02:32:17,146 --> 02:32:18,513
Uncle Frank's had

2304
02:32:18,514 --> 02:32:22,451
a really hard
Thanksgiving weekend.

2305
02:32:24,120 --> 02:32:26,714
What's that?
I hear a chipmunk.

2306
02:32:27,323 --> 02:32:29,223
Is it a walrus?

2307
02:32:29,492 --> 02:32:31,085
No, it's Willie.

2308
02:32:31,494 --> 02:32:34,229
Willie, why don't you
help me with my bag?

2309
02:32:34,230 --> 02:32:36,699
Come on, son.
Help me with my bag.

2310
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,230
Come on. Come on.

2311
02:32:39,669 --> 02:32:43,264
You got it. Hold onto it.
You're strong. Come on.

2312
02:32:45,608 --> 02:32:47,042
Here we are.

2313
02:32:48,278 --> 02:32:50,838
Francine, come on
with me and Willie.

2314
02:32:51,080 --> 02:32:53,849
I'll let you make me
some marshmallow
chocolate.

2315
02:32:53,850 --> 02:32:55,545
What do you say?

2316
02:32:55,852 --> 02:32:56,842
Good!
