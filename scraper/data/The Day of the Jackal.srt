1
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:27,733
August, 1962,
was a stormy time for France.

2
00:00:27,805 --> 00:00:30,832
Many people felt that
President Charles de Gaulle...

3
00:00:30,909 --> 00:00:35,313
had betrayed the country
by giving independence to Algeria.

4
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:38,112
Extremists,
mostly from the army...

5
00:00:38,185 --> 00:00:41,018
swore to kill him in revenge.

6
00:00:41,089 --> 00:00:43,853
They banded together
in an underground movement...

7
00:00:43,926 --> 00:00:47,862
and called themselves the OAS.

8
00:01:32,544 --> 00:01:34,570
The minister's meeting is over!

9
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:49,950
They are very late.

10
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:22,155
The time elapsed from the first
to the last shot was seven seconds.

11
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:26,599
In all, more than 140 shots were fired.

12
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:29,332
Several bullets
pierced the president's car.

13
00:05:29,406 --> 00:05:31,897
One came within an inch
of his head.

14
00:05:31,976 --> 00:05:37,176
But, as if by a miracle, neither
he nor anyone else was hurt.

15
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:40,017
Six months later..

16
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:44,423
Most of the conspirators
have been caught and tried.

17
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:48,327
Their leader, Col. Bastien-Thiry,
has been sentenced to death.

18
00:05:48,395 --> 00:05:53,357
At the last moment, his lawyer
tries for a stay of execution.

19
00:06:10,056 --> 00:06:12,525
The appeal for clemency
has been turned down.

20
00:06:12,592 --> 00:06:15,153
There is nothing more one can do.

21
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:18,631
- I am sorry.
- There is no need.

22
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:22,467
For heaven's sake, don't you
realize you're going to be shot?

23
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:23,972
You don't understand.

24
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,772
No French soldier is going
to raise his rifle against me.

25
00:06:37,256 --> 00:06:41,819
Here is the 8..00 news
for today, March 11, 1963.

26
00:06:41,896 --> 00:06:45,696
An hour ago, in the courtyard
of the Fort Efree, outside Paris...

27
00:06:45,768 --> 00:06:49,704
Lieutenant Colonel Bastien-Thiry
was executed by firing squad...

28
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:53,642
for leading the attempt on the life
of General de Gaulle last August.

29
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,975
The OAS now seems
completely demoralized...

30
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:59,609
by the splendid performance
of our national security forces.

31
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:03,087
Already it is known that the new
chief of operations of the OAS...

32
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,592
Colonel Mark Rodin, a former
paratroop commander in Algeria...

33
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,426
is on the run
and hiding somewhere in Austria.

34
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:13,696
Today's execution must surely mean
that the OAS is finished...

35
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:16,067
once and for all.

36
00:07:23,915 --> 00:07:25,611
What are the finances like, Rene?

37
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,881
No wonder our people are giving up.
They've lost faith.

38
00:07:30,956 --> 00:07:32,925
We've failed them
every single time.

39
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,087
- We won't fail again!
- What can we do?

40
00:07:35,161 --> 00:07:38,188
- We're paralysed.
- Every cop in France knows us.

41
00:07:38,267 --> 00:07:43,638
- Informants are all around us.
- We must find a foreigner.

42
00:07:43,706 --> 00:07:47,541
- A foreigner? Why?
- A contract killer.

43
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:51,012
One that hasn't worked in France
won't have a police record.

44
00:07:51,082 --> 00:07:54,183
- He can come and go as he pleases.
- That sort of person costs money.

45
00:07:55,321 --> 00:07:56,754
Yes.

46
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,351
I'll find the right man.

47
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:04,254
They were going to meet again
in three months in Vienna.

48
00:08:04,332 --> 00:08:08,965
In the pension you both know..
Pension Kleist. June 15.

49
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:11,897
It's a limited market.

50
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:14,350
I've compiled 11 dossiers
over the last three months.

51
00:08:14,376 --> 00:08:17,736
Only those four men
seemed anywhere near right.

52
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:20,905
Now that you've read the files,
what do you think?

53
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,542
- One Englishman did all these jobs?
- I don't believe it.

54
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:26,411
- It's true.
- He did that fellow in the Congo?

55
00:08:26,487 --> 00:08:30,425
- And Trujillo?
- That's our man then, isn't it?

56
00:08:30,492 --> 00:08:32,927
I should say so.

57
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:35,897
I'm glad you agree
on the final choice.

58
00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:38,127
- Because he'll be here any moment.
- What?

59
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:40,932
He's arriving this afternoon
from London.

60
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:10,507
Wolenski.

61
00:09:19,287 --> 00:09:22,085
A normal precaution,
you understand. Come in.

62
00:09:31,869 --> 00:09:36,000
We are not terrorists,
you understand. We are patriots.

63
00:09:36,074 --> 00:09:38,872
Our duty is to the soldiers
who died fighting in Algeria...

64
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:41,778
and the three million Frenchmen
who have always lived there.

65
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:44,180
So you want to get rid of him?

66
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,784
Speaking as a professional,
do you think it's possible?

67
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:53,958
It's possible.
The point is getting away with it.

68
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:56,769
Speaking as a professional,
that's an important consideration.

69
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:59,560
But, in principle,
you'd say it could be done?

70
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:04,973
Yes. With enough time
and planning.

71
00:10:05,043 --> 00:10:07,379
Would be much more difficult
than most other targets.

72
00:10:07,404 --> 00:10:12,045
- Why more?
- de Gaulle has the best security.

73
00:10:12,118 --> 00:10:14,917
Their information
is first-class.

74
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:18,084
You see, gentlemen, not only
have your own efforts failed...

75
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,226
but you've queered the pitch
for everyone else.

76
00:10:20,295 --> 00:10:23,891
- How dare you suggest...
- You can't afford to be emotional.

77
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:26,960
It's why you've made
so many mistakes.

78
00:10:27,037 --> 00:10:29,014
But if we decided to employ
a professional...

79
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,975
You have to employ a professional.

80
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:33,198
Your organization is
so riddled with informers...

81
00:10:33,224 --> 00:10:36,318
that nothing you decide
is a secret for long.

82
00:10:37,584 --> 00:10:39,677
The job would have to be done
by an outsider.

83
00:10:39,754 --> 00:10:43,019
The only question is
by whom and for how much?

84
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:46,853
Will you do it?

85
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:48,362
Yes.

86
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:51,764
- How much?
- This is a once-in-a-lifetime job.

87
00:10:51,835 --> 00:10:54,081
- I could never work again.
- How much do you want?

88
00:10:54,107 --> 00:10:55,702
- Half a million, in cash.
- What?

89
00:10:55,773 --> 00:10:57,765
Half in advance
and half on completion.

90
00:10:57,842 --> 00:11:00,903
- Half a million francs?
- Dollars.

91
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,744
- Are you mad?
- You'll get France in return.

92
00:11:03,816 --> 00:11:05,808
I'd have thought it
a reasonable price.

93
00:11:05,886 --> 00:11:10,221
If you can't manage it,
there's nothing more to be said.

94
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,485
We accept.

95
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,225
- How many people know about this?
- Just the four of us.

96
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,602
Let's keep it that way. This job
depends on absolute secrecy.

97
00:11:22,672 --> 00:11:24,335
No notes must be kept.

98
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:27,239
If any one of you is captured,
I shall feel free to call it off.

99
00:11:27,265 --> 00:11:30,807
I suggest you stay in a safe place
under guard until the work is done.

100
00:11:30,883 --> 00:11:33,853
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

101
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,049
The planning will be mine.
No one else will get the details...

102
00:11:37,124 --> 00:11:39,184
and you will hear nothing
from me again.

103
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,230
This is the name and account
number of my bank in Switzerland.

104
00:11:42,297 --> 00:11:45,324
When they tell me the first
$250,000 has been deposited...

105
00:11:45,401 --> 00:11:47,894
I'll move, provided I'm ready.

106
00:11:47,971 --> 00:11:52,272
- I'll not be hurried in any way.
- Agreed.

107
00:11:52,343 --> 00:11:54,679
All I want from you is
a telephone number in Paris...

108
00:11:54,705 --> 00:11:57,275
that I could call about changes
in de Gaulle's plans.

109
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,183
The contact mustn't know
who I am or what this is about.

110
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:03,038
- Send me the number by mail.
- How do you expect us to find...

111
00:12:03,064 --> 00:12:06,220
- half a million dollars so soon?
- Use your network to rob banks.

112
00:12:06,294 --> 00:12:08,319
One last thing.

113
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:14,002
What code name will you use?

114
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:17,837
- Why not the Jackal?
- Why not?

115
00:12:19,744 --> 00:12:22,680
From now on, you'll be working
completely alone.

116
00:12:22,747 --> 00:12:27,686
Not completely. One will have
the cooperation of de Gaulle.

117
00:12:27,754 --> 00:12:32,193
He won't listen to his security
and stay out of the public eye.

118
00:12:33,428 --> 00:12:36,694
A pleasant journey home, Mr...
Mr.Jackal.

119
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,839
960,000 francs?
This has got to stop!

120
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:20,681
You're the Chief
of Action Service.

121
00:13:20,752 --> 00:13:23,448
You've had three weeks to find out
if the OAS is behind this.

122
00:13:23,491 --> 00:13:26,586
- If they are, what are they up to?
- It is the OAS, General.

123
00:13:26,661 --> 00:13:30,028
But the ones we've caught
are small fry.

124
00:13:30,099 --> 00:13:32,863
They've been ordered to do it,
but they don't know why.

125
00:13:32,935 --> 00:13:35,267
The minister has been
after me again.

126
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:37,864
We've questioned known OAS people.
They know nothing.

127
00:13:37,941 --> 00:13:40,536
- Not even the high echelons.
- What about the informers?

128
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,206
Nothing. But we found out
this morning...

129
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:45,876
that Rodin and the other two
are in Rome.

130
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,045
They arrived on June 18.

131
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:50,592
They've taken the two top floors
in the Hotel Garibaldi.

132
00:13:50,624 --> 00:13:53,685
- You're watching them?
- Twenty-four hours a day.

133
00:15:24,108 --> 00:15:27,202
Birth certificate, please.
Paul Oliver Duggan.

134
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:31,216
Born in the parish of
Sambourne Fishley, April 3, 1929.

135
00:15:31,283 --> 00:15:34,151
Fill in the form. You'll find
the 1929s up those stairs...

136
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,376
- and left at the first gallery.
- Right. Thanks.

137
00:17:19,082 --> 00:17:20,515
Thank you, sir.

138
00:17:24,523 --> 00:17:28,892
Excuse me, please.
How many krone to the pound?

139
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:32,056
The official parity rate
is 19.34.

140
00:17:48,117 --> 00:17:50,815
Hello.
Two bottles of Hairpin, please.

141
00:17:50,889 --> 00:17:54,154
One in chestnut brown
and one in Gray.

142
00:17:55,995 --> 00:17:58,463
I've only got Clairol, dear.

143
00:17:58,532 --> 00:18:03,095
That's fine.
And also a tin of solvent.

144
00:18:14,017 --> 00:18:16,782
- It is here.
- Is it?

145
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,638
Hello.

146
00:18:31,705 --> 00:18:33,298
Yes.

147
00:18:33,376 --> 00:18:35,400
Hello, Zurich?

148
00:18:35,478 --> 00:18:37,776
Mr. Kola, this is he.

149
00:18:37,848 --> 00:18:41,808
That's right.
Account number 50664.

150
00:18:41,885 --> 00:18:44,081
The money's been deposited.

151
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:45,588
How much?

152
00:19:02,844 --> 00:19:04,278
Attention please.

153
00:19:04,347 --> 00:19:09,945
Air Italia announces the departure
of Flight 127 to Genova.

154
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:12,489
Now boarding at Gate 5.

155
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:34,848
The Hotel Garibaldi is owned
by a Frenchman with OAS sympathies.

156
00:19:34,918 --> 00:19:38,650
Extra Action Service staff have
been sent from Paris to Rome...

157
00:19:38,722 --> 00:19:41,419
to keep watching them
around the clock.

158
00:19:43,563 --> 00:19:48,297
Rodin, Montclair and Casson
live at the top floor alone.

159
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:50,496
On the next floor down
are the bodyguards:

160
00:19:50,571 --> 00:19:53,336
ex-paratroopers
or foreign legionnaires.

161
00:19:53,408 --> 00:19:55,308
- How many?
- Eight.

162
00:19:55,376 --> 00:19:57,470
They're afraid of being kidnapped.

163
00:19:57,546 --> 00:20:00,072
I know Rodin.
He's not a man to be afraid.

164
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:03,347
The lift doors on the top floor
are welded together...

165
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,753
and everything has to go
through the bodyguards.

166
00:20:05,823 --> 00:20:09,418
Not one of them has set a foot
outside the hotel for five weeks.

167
00:20:09,495 --> 00:20:12,260
The only contact
with the outside world is one man:

168
00:20:12,332 --> 00:20:15,165
- Adjutant Wolenski.
- Tell me about him.

169
00:20:15,235 --> 00:20:17,170
Bersie, run the film, please.

170
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,370
This is Wolenski.

171
00:20:24,446 --> 00:20:27,348
He goes to the post office
every morning and afternoon.

172
00:20:31,556 --> 00:20:36,722
See that? You'll have to cut his
hand off to get the mail from him.

173
00:20:49,912 --> 00:20:52,159
He always waits until
the collection van arrives...

174
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,343
before he posts any letters.

175
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:55,850
Then he picks up the mail.

176
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,489
All their mail comes
to general delivery...

177
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:09,058
and is addressed
in the name of Partrier.

178
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:13,130
Wolenski, of course,
can identify himself as such.

179
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:18,837
Colonel Rolland here.

180
00:21:18,914 --> 00:21:22,783
I want everything you've got
on a foreign legionnaire.

181
00:21:22,852 --> 00:21:26,219
- His name is Viktor Wolenski.
- If the OAS is planning something...

182
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,953
then their agents
must be working on it now.

183
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:32,019
You must find out who they are
and where they make contact.

184
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,494
I let myself in.

185
00:21:59,498 --> 00:22:02,366
I'll make us some coffee.

186
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:06,672
Denise.

187
00:22:09,611 --> 00:22:13,104
I ask you to get rid of these
for your own safety.

188
00:22:14,183 --> 00:22:15,616
I'll do it tonight.

189
00:22:15,685 --> 00:22:18,052
Maybe I should do it for you now.

190
00:22:19,957 --> 00:22:22,950
They know all about your fiance.

191
00:22:33,974 --> 00:22:37,240
I have an assignment for you
that sounds very important.

192
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,576
It's not very pleasant.

193
00:22:40,783 --> 00:22:42,216
Go on.

194
00:22:48,526 --> 00:22:52,019
They want you to get involved
with an Elysee Palace official...

195
00:22:52,097 --> 00:22:55,534
someone fairly close to de Gaulle.

196
00:22:55,601 --> 00:22:58,435
It might be dangerous.

197
00:22:58,504 --> 00:23:01,134
It's certainly distasteful.

198
00:23:04,946 --> 00:23:09,680
- Who is this official?
- I'll show him to you in a week.

199
00:23:35,316 --> 00:23:40,516
- Good afternoon.
- Yes, please come in.

200
00:23:43,593 --> 00:23:47,529
- You think you can do it?
- Certainly.

201
00:23:47,598 --> 00:23:50,431
I can take an existing gun,
make the modifications.

202
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,834
It must be very light in weight,
and it must have a short barrel.

203
00:23:53,905 --> 00:23:57,865
A short barrel.
That's a pity.

204
00:23:57,944 --> 00:24:02,074
Lastly, there must be a silencer
and a telescopic sight.

205
00:24:05,052 --> 00:24:08,022
Over what range will you fire?

206
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:12,027
I'm not sure yet, but probably
not more than 400 feet.

207
00:24:12,095 --> 00:24:15,361
- Will the gentleman be moving?
- Stationary.

208
00:24:15,431 --> 00:24:18,664
Will you go for a head shot
or a chest shot?

209
00:24:18,737 --> 00:24:20,294
Probably head.

210
00:24:20,372 --> 00:24:22,307
What about the chances
of a second shot?

211
00:24:22,374 --> 00:24:25,139
I might get the chance,
but I doubt it.

212
00:24:25,211 --> 00:24:27,373
I'll need a silencer to escape.

213
00:24:28,515 --> 00:24:31,849
Then you'd better
have explosive bullets.

214
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,187
- I can prepare a handful for you.
- Glycerin or mercury?

215
00:24:36,258 --> 00:24:38,852
Mercury, I think.

216
00:24:40,931 --> 00:24:43,195
It's much cleaner.

217
00:24:43,267 --> 00:24:46,259
- More Campari?
- No, thank you.

218
00:24:46,337 --> 00:24:49,535
It seems then, the gun must be
carried past Customs...

219
00:24:49,608 --> 00:24:51,634
without arousing suspicion.

220
00:24:54,948 --> 00:24:56,883
Recognize that?

221
00:25:00,754 --> 00:25:02,911
The whole thing should
be composed of a series...

222
00:25:02,937 --> 00:25:05,419
of hollow aluminium tubes
which screw together.

223
00:25:05,494 --> 00:25:08,953
The top one holds the rifle strut.

224
00:25:09,032 --> 00:25:12,058
The one below, the bolt
with the breech inside it.

225
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:15,037
The shoulder rest of the rifle
doubles for both purposes...

226
00:25:15,106 --> 00:25:17,575
- without changing in any way.
- That's excellent.

227
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:21,010
The last two sections house
the telescopic sight and silencer.

228
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:22,514
Here.

229
00:25:24,751 --> 00:25:28,314
It's very remarkable.
It's so simple.

230
00:25:28,389 --> 00:25:30,757
I shall need the gun
in about two weeks.

231
00:25:32,428 --> 00:25:36,297
If you could meet me here
August 13...

232
00:25:36,366 --> 00:25:39,152
then you could try out the gun
and discuss last minute details.

233
00:25:39,177 --> 00:25:40,560
Very well. August 13.

234
00:25:40,637 --> 00:25:42,970
Now the question of your fee.

235
00:25:48,515 --> 00:25:54,045
I have to ask a fee of 1,000$
for this kind of a job, you see...

236
00:25:54,122 --> 00:25:56,216
and, say...

237
00:25:56,290 --> 00:26:00,524
another 100$ or 200$
for the raw materials.

238
00:26:00,597 --> 00:26:02,565
Done.

239
00:26:02,632 --> 00:26:07,332
I'll pay you half the fee now
and the rest on delivery.

240
00:26:38,911 --> 00:26:42,814
What do you think?
Marvellous, eh?

241
00:26:42,882 --> 00:26:46,113
I knew you didn't come to Genova
for a driver's license.

242
00:26:46,186 --> 00:26:48,587
Anyone in London
could've done that.

243
00:26:48,656 --> 00:26:51,922
The problem is I won't have time
to play around with makeup.

244
00:26:51,993 --> 00:26:55,624
- I'm not much good at it anyway.
- Forget about makeup.

245
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:59,533
The important thing is the skin.
It must look Gray and tired.

246
00:26:59,603 --> 00:27:04,007
We used a trick in the army to
fake illness and get out of duty.

247
00:27:04,075 --> 00:27:07,842
- Can you get some cordite?
- I suppose so.

248
00:27:07,914 --> 00:27:10,849
You swallow a couple
of small pieces of cordite.

249
00:27:10,917 --> 00:27:14,409
It'll make you feel sick
and turn the skin a Gray colour.

250
00:27:14,489 --> 00:27:16,958
After about an hour,
you'll feel all right again.

251
00:27:17,024 --> 00:27:20,358
- Your skin'll look Gray longer.
- I'll try it.

252
00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:25,892
- What about the French documents?
- French identity card's all right.

253
00:27:25,969 --> 00:27:28,701
The other one, I don't think
I've seen what they look like...

254
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:30,206
let alone copy it.

255
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:32,836
I'll get a colleague in France
to pick someone's pocket...

256
00:27:32,862 --> 00:27:35,212
so I can make a duplicate.

257
00:27:35,281 --> 00:27:39,116
Give me more time, more money.

258
00:27:39,186 --> 00:27:40,745
How much more?

259
00:27:40,821 --> 00:27:44,053
Five hundred.

260
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:46,059
Three hundred pounds?

261
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:51,867
- Half now, half on delivery.
- When will I hear from you?

262
00:27:51,935 --> 00:27:54,404
I'll be returning to Genova
on August 14.

263
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:58,239
Be in the same place
where we met tonight at 6:00.

264
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,403
Must be a big job you've got.

265
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,846
There are certain things
I wish to make clear.

266
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:05,431
When you've finished, you will
hand over the negatives...

267
00:28:05,457 --> 00:28:08,015
and all the prints
of the photographs you've taken.

268
00:28:08,088 --> 00:28:09,930
You will also forget
the name of Duggan...

269
00:28:09,991 --> 00:28:13,552
and the name on the French
documents you're going to produce.

270
00:28:13,629 --> 00:28:15,563
Is that understood?

271
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:47,944
Taking it easy?
I wish I had your job.

272
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,388
All my tenants are on holiday.
What time is it?

273
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:54,223
- Half past 5:00.
- I must hurry.

274
00:30:54,295 --> 00:30:56,230
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

275
00:32:55,112 --> 00:32:56,545
That's him. See?

276
00:32:56,615 --> 00:33:01,280
In the light coat.
He's the Elysee Palace official.

277
00:33:01,353 --> 00:33:03,958
He'll pack his wife and children
off to the Loire Valley...

278
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:06,124
for the annual holiday.

279
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,161
You haven't got much time.

280
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,758
I need Wolenski.

281
00:33:11,832 --> 00:33:14,701
Arrange to get him
across the border.

282
00:33:14,769 --> 00:33:18,831
What? Never mind
the Italian government.

283
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:20,501
Once he's inside France...

284
00:33:20,577 --> 00:33:23,375
bring him to Paris immediately.

285
00:34:13,243 --> 00:34:15,872
You're being very foolish, Viktor.

286
00:34:18,482 --> 00:34:21,884
You know yourself,
they always talk in the end.

287
00:34:21,953 --> 00:34:26,687
You've seen it with your own
two eyes in Indo-China.

288
00:34:29,463 --> 00:34:31,694
And in Algeria, of course.

289
00:34:35,036 --> 00:34:37,870
Tell us what they're waiting for
in that hotel!

290
00:34:47,553 --> 00:34:52,547
What are they planning?
Who have they been meeting with?

291
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:56,891
Nobody? Not a soul?

292
00:34:58,466 --> 00:35:02,461
Then where were they
before they went to Rome?

293
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,335
Tell us, Viktor.

294
00:35:15,787 --> 00:35:18,018
Go back a bit.

295
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,184
Hold it. Stop.

296
00:35:22,729 --> 00:35:27,600
Question: Rome, Viktor.
Why did they go to Rome?

297
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:30,137
- No answer.
- Check.

298
00:35:30,205 --> 00:35:32,800
Question:
Why are they in Rome?

299
00:35:32,876 --> 00:35:36,005
- Answer: Secret.
- Check.

300
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,983
Question: Where did they stay
in Vienna, Viktor?

301
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,985
- No answer.
- Check.

302
00:35:42,053 --> 00:35:43,988
Was it a house?

303
00:35:45,057 --> 00:35:48,858
I am asking you, was it a house?

304
00:35:48,928 --> 00:35:51,454
Answer:

305
00:35:51,533 --> 00:35:54,502
Kleist.

306
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:01,510
Go on.

307
00:36:03,047 --> 00:36:08,007
Question: Who is Kleist?
What does he do?

308
00:36:10,756 --> 00:36:14,921
What did they do to the bastard?
I can't understand a word.

309
00:36:14,994 --> 00:36:16,926
- Put it on the speakers.
- Where from, sir?

310
00:36:16,952 --> 00:36:19,217
"Who is Kleist?"
That bit.

311
00:36:22,604 --> 00:36:26,200
Who is Kleist?
What does he do?

312
00:36:36,921 --> 00:36:41,883
Jack? Jackie?
Would that be Jackie?

313
00:36:41,962 --> 00:36:44,396
Jackie?
That's not possible.

314
00:36:44,465 --> 00:36:46,899
Go back, and this time
turn up the sound.

315
00:37:11,531 --> 00:37:16,026
Heel, Rex!
Rex, come here!

316
00:37:27,285 --> 00:37:31,553
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

317
00:37:31,623 --> 00:37:34,218
Do you want me to call
for an ambulance?

318
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:39,398
- Are you sure?
- I'll survive.

319
00:37:41,201 --> 00:37:43,899
There. See?

320
00:37:45,307 --> 00:37:49,244
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault, my dear.

321
00:37:53,318 --> 00:37:56,345
- Sorry to drag you away, Colonel.
- Nonsense.

322
00:37:56,421 --> 00:37:59,414
The tape is on your machine
in case you want to refer back...

323
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:02,188
and here is the transcript.

324
00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:23,307
Jackal.

325
00:38:23,441 --> 00:38:26,605
I thought Wolenski used it
as a swear word...

326
00:38:26,678 --> 00:38:28,612
but it doesn't sound like him.

327
00:38:30,883 --> 00:38:32,316
Fair.

328
00:38:36,223 --> 00:38:39,660
Excuse me, Colonel.
The foreigner...

329
00:38:39,727 --> 00:38:42,821
Could it be a fair foreigner?
A blonde?

330
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:49,304
Is Kleist the foreigner?

331
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:58,175
Colonel, it's 4:30.

332
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:12,463
The plot described above
constitutes, in my view...

333
00:39:12,535 --> 00:39:14,470
the most dangerous
single conception...

334
00:39:14,537 --> 00:39:18,304
that the terrorists
could possibly have devised...

335
00:39:18,376 --> 00:39:22,143
to endanger the life
of President de Gaulle.

336
00:39:22,213 --> 00:39:26,116
If the plot exists as described...

337
00:39:26,186 --> 00:39:30,055
and if a foreign-born assassin,
whose code name may be "Jackal"...

338
00:39:30,123 --> 00:39:33,651
has, in fact, been engaged
for this attempt on the life...

339
00:39:33,728 --> 00:39:38,166
- Sorry.
- On the life of the president...

340
00:39:38,233 --> 00:39:41,761
it is my duty to inform you,
Minister, that in my opinion...

341
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:44,831
we face a national emergency.

342
00:39:44,909 --> 00:39:47,002
New paragraph.

343
00:39:47,077 --> 00:39:51,174
The above report is top secret
and intended for your eyes only.

344
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:54,185
Written at 0800 hours...

345
00:39:54,253 --> 00:39:58,054
August 14, 1963.

346
00:39:58,125 --> 00:40:01,618
Address to the Minister
of the Interior.

347
00:40:01,697 --> 00:40:04,860
Have the dispatch rider
stand by...

348
00:40:04,933 --> 00:40:07,199
and forget everything
you've heard.

349
00:41:09,614 --> 00:41:14,177
- Well?
- If what Rolland says is true...

350
00:41:14,254 --> 00:41:19,385
the whole network of our agents
inside the OAS is no good to us.

351
00:41:23,464 --> 00:41:26,059
The president must be told.

352
00:41:26,135 --> 00:41:28,569
I'll ask for an interview.

353
00:41:28,638 --> 00:41:30,731
Get me the Elysee Palace.

354
00:41:54,537 --> 00:41:57,132
Minister.
One moment, sir.

355
00:42:02,146 --> 00:42:04,138
The Minister of the Interior.

356
00:42:16,732 --> 00:42:18,666
There you are.

357
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,234
It's all there.

358
00:42:28,011 --> 00:42:31,448
The driving license and the French
identity card were easy enough...

359
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:35,920
but that third card
was a big headache.

360
00:42:35,988 --> 00:42:38,423
It's nicely dog-eared,
isn't it?

361
00:42:39,826 --> 00:42:42,455
- Have you forgotten something?
- Sorry?

362
00:42:43,998 --> 00:42:47,264
The original driving license
I said I wanted back.

363
00:42:49,005 --> 00:42:51,235
I thought we might have
a chat about that.

364
00:42:56,348 --> 00:42:59,476
The fact is, the original
driving license is not here.

365
00:42:59,551 --> 00:43:02,885
But don't worry. It's put away
in a very safe place.

366
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,549
Nobody can get at it but me.

367
00:43:07,628 --> 00:43:10,393
- What do you want?
- I'm coming to that.

368
00:43:10,465 --> 00:43:13,230
What I propose is
simply a little trade.

369
00:43:13,302 --> 00:43:15,599
I give you the original
driving license...

370
00:43:15,671 --> 00:43:18,402
and all those negatives
I took of you...

371
00:43:18,475 --> 00:43:20,410
for a certain sum of money.

372
00:43:20,477 --> 00:43:22,946
- How much?
- A thousand pounds.

373
00:43:23,014 --> 00:43:27,577
Isn't it worth that
to get those documents back?

374
00:43:28,654 --> 00:43:30,486
I suppose so.

375
00:43:30,557 --> 00:43:34,255
An English gentleman can always
be trusted to see sense.

376
00:43:34,328 --> 00:43:38,264
I can find the first 500 by noon
tomorrow, but we don't meet here.

377
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:40,096
There's nothing wrong
with this place.

378
00:43:40,168 --> 00:43:42,102
It's very quiet and private.

379
00:43:42,171 --> 00:43:44,264
There's everything wrong
with this place.

380
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:49,108
Forget about that. Nobody comes
here unless they're invited by me.

381
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:54,118
One has to be very discreet,
you know, in my little sideline.

382
00:45:34,077 --> 00:45:38,105
- I asked for aluminium.
- I tried the aluminium...

383
00:45:38,182 --> 00:45:40,447
but it bent like tissue paper.

384
00:45:40,518 --> 00:45:43,112
I had to use stainless steel.

385
00:45:43,189 --> 00:45:45,783
But it's all right.
It looks the same.

386
00:45:45,858 --> 00:45:49,625
- Where can I practice?
- There's the Montemorro Forest.

387
00:45:49,696 --> 00:45:51,631
You could be there and back
in a day.

388
00:45:51,698 --> 00:45:54,463
- Excuse me.
- I won't need the case.

389
00:45:54,535 --> 00:45:56,470
Silencer, please.

390
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:02,237
Strut.

391
00:46:05,483 --> 00:46:09,580
- And the sniper scope.
- Here.

392
00:46:14,994 --> 00:46:16,758
Trigger.

393
00:46:16,829 --> 00:46:18,422
Trigger, please.

394
00:46:37,021 --> 00:46:41,289
Beautiful piece of work.
It's really excellent.

395
00:46:43,863 --> 00:46:48,130
These are for practice.
I took out six of them...

396
00:46:48,203 --> 00:46:50,170
to convert to explosive tips.

397
00:46:52,741 --> 00:46:54,437
Let me have one.

398
00:47:10,154 --> 00:47:13,249
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening.

399
00:47:13,325 --> 00:47:14,917
Please sit down.

400
00:47:16,662 --> 00:47:19,756
I trust that you've all read
Colonel Rolland's report?

401
00:47:21,335 --> 00:47:24,930
I delivered a copy
to the president this afternoon.

402
00:47:25,005 --> 00:47:28,442
Unhappily, in the interest
of the dignity of France...

403
00:47:28,509 --> 00:47:31,844
he feels obliged to impose
enormous limitations on us.

404
00:47:31,914 --> 00:47:34,941
He refuses to alter in any way...

405
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,783
the summer schedule
of his public appearances.

406
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:40,449
- Good heavens.
- The search for this Jackal...

407
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:43,289
will be conducted
in absolute secrecy.

408
00:47:43,362 --> 00:47:46,628
Needless to say, you are all
sworn to total silence...

409
00:47:46,699 --> 00:47:48,810
and won't discuss this matter
outside this room.

410
00:47:49,769 --> 00:47:53,638
- But, Minister...
- But it's impossible!

411
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:57,303
The president
was absolutely adamant.

412
00:47:57,379 --> 00:48:00,907
What extra security precautions
do we take, Minister?

413
00:48:00,983 --> 00:48:02,781
None.

414
00:48:02,853 --> 00:48:06,585
General Colbert.
Any success in Vienna?

415
00:48:06,658 --> 00:48:11,095
Inquiries were made by our agents
at the Pension Kleist.

416
00:48:11,163 --> 00:48:14,099
They showed photographs
of Rodin, Montclair and Casson...

417
00:48:14,167 --> 00:48:15,759
to the desk clerk.

418
00:48:15,835 --> 00:48:19,932
Some money changed hands.
He stated that he recognized them.

419
00:48:20,007 --> 00:48:22,374
They had arrived on June 14.

420
00:48:23,512 --> 00:48:25,003
Were there any visitors?

421
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,948
One man the next afternoon.

422
00:48:28,017 --> 00:48:30,452
He left half an hour later.

423
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,614
The only description
the clerk could give...

424
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:35,455
was the man was well-groomed...

425
00:48:35,527 --> 00:48:37,860
in his early thirties
and had fair hair.

426
00:48:39,699 --> 00:48:41,633
Surely a better description
can be found.

427
00:48:41,702 --> 00:48:43,135
From whom?

428
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:48,065
Rodin, for instance.

429
00:48:49,243 --> 00:48:51,474
I hardly think
he'd accept an invitation...

430
00:48:51,547 --> 00:48:53,709
from any of our departments,
Colonel.

431
00:48:58,722 --> 00:49:03,252
Commissioner Berthier,
any suggestions?

432
00:49:03,328 --> 00:49:05,262
We're in trouble on this one.

433
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:07,765
Our agents inside the OAS
can't pin him down...

434
00:49:07,834 --> 00:49:10,428
since not even the OAS
know who he is.

435
00:49:10,503 --> 00:49:13,769
Action Service can't destroy him.
They don't know who to destroy.

436
00:49:13,841 --> 00:49:16,161
Territorial surveillance can't
pick him up at the border...

437
00:49:16,184 --> 00:49:17,937
because they don't know
what he looks like.

438
00:49:18,012 --> 00:49:20,948
The gendarmes, all 48,000 of them,
can't pursue him.

439
00:49:21,017 --> 00:49:22,950
They don't know who to pursue.

440
00:49:23,019 --> 00:49:26,649
The police can't arrest him.
We don't know who to arrest.

441
00:49:28,025 --> 00:49:31,120
Without a name, all other
proposals are meaningless.

442
00:49:31,196 --> 00:49:33,221
The first task then is to find it.

443
00:49:33,299 --> 00:49:37,235
With a name,
we get a passport and a face.

444
00:49:37,303 --> 00:49:39,966
With a face, we get an arrest.

445
00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:43,635
But to find his name,
and to do it in secret...

446
00:49:43,712 --> 00:49:45,976
is a job of pure detective work.

447
00:49:46,048 --> 00:49:49,815
Commissioner, who is the best
detective on the force?

448
00:49:52,221 --> 00:49:54,019
The best detective on the force...

449
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:57,357
is my own deputy commissioner,
Claude Lebel.

450
00:50:02,536 --> 00:50:03,969
Claude!

451
00:50:08,776 --> 00:50:10,938
Berthier wants to see you.

452
00:50:11,013 --> 00:50:13,447
- What? Now?
- He's sent a car.

453
00:50:16,352 --> 00:50:18,946
Don't be back
later than 9:00.

454
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:35,668
Commissioner Lebel.

455
00:50:39,914 --> 00:50:41,849
Good evening.

456
00:50:43,853 --> 00:50:47,312
Remember, you have full powers
in this investigation...

457
00:50:47,391 --> 00:50:49,906
and the resources of every
department represented here...

458
00:50:49,932 --> 00:50:51,354
entirely at your disposal.

459
00:50:51,429 --> 00:50:55,992
My instructions are simply:
no publicity and do not fail.

460
00:50:56,069 --> 00:51:00,439
Keep your copy of the report.
Any questions?

461
00:51:00,507 --> 00:51:02,635
No, Minister.

462
00:51:02,711 --> 00:51:05,111
In that case, I'll not detain you.

463
00:51:07,349 --> 00:51:09,112
Thank you, Commissioner.

464
00:51:15,526 --> 00:51:18,462
Collect the reports,
and put them in my private safe.

465
00:51:18,531 --> 00:51:20,327
- Yes, Minister.
- Good night, gentlemen.

466
00:51:20,353 --> 00:51:22,754
- Good night.
- Thank you.

467
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:39,321
You'll have to drop whatever
you're doing. Everything.

468
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:41,153
Clear the desk completely.

469
00:51:41,225 --> 00:51:43,660
You want a new office?

470
00:51:43,727 --> 00:51:47,165
From now on it's headquarters
for this job, nothing else.

471
00:51:47,232 --> 00:51:50,327
The minister said he wants
a progress report by you...

472
00:51:50,403 --> 00:51:52,531
every evening from now on.

473
00:51:52,606 --> 00:51:55,507
- Here. 10:00 sharp.
- Oh, God.

474
00:51:55,577 --> 00:51:57,010
I know.

475
00:51:57,078 --> 00:52:00,536
You've just got to find him
before he gets to de Gaulle.

476
00:52:00,616 --> 00:52:03,643
- I wonder if he has a timetable.
- I'm sure he has.

477
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:05,654
The trouble is, only he knows it.

478
00:52:05,721 --> 00:52:09,318
He might go for a hit tomorrow
or maybe not for a month.

479
00:52:09,393 --> 00:52:11,987
You've just got to work flat out
until you locate him.

480
00:52:12,063 --> 00:52:16,000
After that, we can have Action
Service do the rest, the thugs.

481
00:52:16,068 --> 00:52:20,301
Obviously, you've got to have
a heavy mob for a thing like this.

482
00:52:20,373 --> 00:52:24,812
Anyway, just go and find
this Jackal, will you?

483
00:52:26,381 --> 00:52:28,474
What?

484
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:31,315
- I'll need help.
- Who?

485
00:52:31,387 --> 00:52:33,982
Young Caron,
and he'll have to be told.

486
00:52:34,057 --> 00:52:37,117
- I'll have to get clearance.
- All I want is Caron.

487
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:38,661
That's all.

488
00:52:44,737 --> 00:52:49,004
You know what they'll do to you
if you don't catch him in time?

489
00:52:49,076 --> 00:52:52,012
I've been given a job,
so we'll just have to do it.

490
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,014
But no crime
has been committed yet.

491
00:52:54,081 --> 00:52:57,177
Where are we supposed to start
looking for the criminal?

492
00:52:57,252 --> 00:52:59,380
We start by recognizing that,
after de Gaulle...

493
00:52:59,455 --> 00:53:01,946
we are the two most
powerful people in France.

494
00:53:02,026 --> 00:53:03,584
Now make notes.

495
00:53:04,862 --> 00:53:07,627
Get my secretary transferred
until further notice.

496
00:53:07,699 --> 00:53:11,295
You will be my secretary
and assistant rolled into one.

497
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:14,636
I want a bed in here
with linen and all the usual...

498
00:53:14,708 --> 00:53:18,145
including something to wash in
and shaving things.

499
00:53:18,212 --> 00:53:20,476
Also, get a percolator
and lots of coffee.

500
00:53:20,548 --> 00:53:23,484
- Right, sir.
- Get onto the switchboard.

501
00:53:23,552 --> 00:53:26,488
I want a good telephonist,
the best they've got.

502
00:53:26,555 --> 00:53:29,821
I need ten outside lines
open around-the-clock.

503
00:53:29,893 --> 00:53:32,159
If there's any nonsense,
refer them to Berthier.

504
00:53:32,229 --> 00:53:34,664
This job gets top priority
at all times.

505
00:53:34,733 --> 00:53:36,826
Do you want anything
from them immediately?

506
00:53:36,902 --> 00:53:38,666
A person-to-person link
to the heads...

507
00:53:38,738 --> 00:53:41,172
of the homicide divisions
of the following countries:

508
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,869
Holland, Belgium, Italy...

509
00:53:43,944 --> 00:53:47,210
West Germany and South Africa.

510
00:53:47,282 --> 00:53:49,216
The FBI in the United States...

511
00:53:49,284 --> 00:53:51,719
and Scotland Yard's
Special Branch in Britain.

512
00:53:51,787 --> 00:53:54,381
- How many is that?
- Seven.

513
00:53:54,457 --> 00:53:57,052
Get the head man at home
or in the office.

514
00:53:57,127 --> 00:53:59,373
Ask them to take a call from me
tomorrow morning...

515
00:53:59,399 --> 00:54:01,993
and see that there's
no one listening in.

516
00:54:02,066 --> 00:54:04,402
In the meantime, I'm going
down to general records...

517
00:54:04,428 --> 00:54:08,135
to check if this Jackal
has ever operated inside France.

518
00:54:08,208 --> 00:54:12,646
Sir, how do you know the Jackal
comes from any of these countries?

519
00:54:12,713 --> 00:54:16,810
I don't. But he must be
on file somewhere.

520
00:54:36,131 --> 00:54:40,398
- Sorry I'm late, darling.
- What kept you so long?

521
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:44,498
- There was a long meeting.
- I've been waiting for hours.

522
00:54:44,575 --> 00:54:48,602
Yes, I'm sorry
about the hour, but...

523
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:53,744
Yes, Washington, I know it's
7:00 there. It's midnight here.

524
00:54:53,819 --> 00:54:56,413
What?

525
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:59,220
Could you call him
at the club, please?

526
00:55:00,395 --> 00:55:01,828
I didn't go out.

527
00:55:01,896 --> 00:55:04,387
I just sat waiting
for you to call.

528
00:55:04,466 --> 00:55:06,866
It was impossible.
There was a crisis on.

529
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:09,700
Crisis? What crisis?

530
00:55:09,774 --> 00:55:11,207
Never mind.

531
00:55:17,449 --> 00:55:20,043
- What crisis?
- It was nothing.

532
00:55:21,955 --> 00:55:23,546
What crisis?

533
00:55:28,463 --> 00:55:29,987
Mr. Mallinson.

534
00:55:30,066 --> 00:55:34,935
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.
It's Paris. Inspector Caron.

535
00:55:35,005 --> 00:55:37,476
I don't wish to sound rude,
but wouldn't it be better...

536
00:55:37,507 --> 00:55:41,569
if routine inquiries could be
conducted through proper channels?

537
00:55:41,646 --> 00:55:45,583
- Preferably when we're all awake.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Mallinson.

538
00:55:45,651 --> 00:55:48,085
It is very urgent.

539
00:55:48,154 --> 00:55:50,625
Commissioner Lebel didn't wish
to make a formal request.

540
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:53,751
He was rather hoping that you'd
cooperate with us unofficially.

541
00:55:53,828 --> 00:55:58,425
All right. I'll take the
commissioner's call at 8:30.

542
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,526
Fine. Good night.

543
00:56:02,105 --> 00:56:03,697
What's left of it.

544
00:56:03,774 --> 00:56:06,868
- Who was that?
- The old boy network.

545
00:57:00,177 --> 00:57:01,610
Yes?

546
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:04,443
- Denise.
- Valmy here.

547
00:57:04,516 --> 00:57:06,450
They found out about the Jackal.

548
00:57:10,022 --> 00:57:11,888
All I found in central records...

549
00:57:11,959 --> 00:57:14,951
was that in the ten last years
there've only been...

550
00:57:15,029 --> 00:57:17,123
four contract killers in France.

551
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:21,135
We've got three. The fourth is
serving time in Africa somewhere.

552
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:23,968
So our man must be from abroad.

553
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:27,408
Surely, he's come to someone's
attention somewhere.

554
00:57:29,214 --> 00:57:31,910
- Who do I speak to first?
- Scotland Yard...

555
00:57:31,983 --> 00:57:34,475
Special Branch.

556
00:57:34,553 --> 00:57:38,046
Assistant Commissioner Mallinson.

557
00:57:38,124 --> 00:57:42,322
There's no name.
Nothing to go on, I'm afraid.

558
00:57:45,066 --> 00:57:48,662
All this unofficial secrecy
is pretty irregular, isn't it?

559
00:57:48,737 --> 00:57:53,334
- Makes my task difficult.
- Yes, I know.

560
00:57:53,409 --> 00:57:56,846
I've never heard of a political
killer in this country.

561
00:57:56,915 --> 00:58:00,181
- It's not our style, is it?
- It's more your department...

562
00:58:00,252 --> 00:58:03,450
- so I'll leave it in your hands.
- Yes, but...

563
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:06,218
Try to get it out of the way
by tomorrow.

564
00:58:06,292 --> 00:58:08,818
I'm understaffed as it is.

565
00:58:08,897 --> 00:58:10,922
Yes, sir.

566
00:58:15,037 --> 00:58:16,470
What's the cost?

567
01:01:33,488 --> 01:01:36,754
Give me the foreign office,
would you, please, luv?

568
01:01:36,825 --> 01:01:38,759
Extension 905.

569
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:47,499
Hello, Barrie?
Brian Thomas.

570
01:01:47,572 --> 01:01:51,941
Could you meet me in an hour
at the usual place?

571
01:01:58,252 --> 01:02:01,119
We've been plowing through
the files till we're cross-eyed.

572
01:02:01,189 --> 01:02:03,180
None of them fits the description.

573
01:02:03,258 --> 01:02:05,853
But before we drop it,
I had a thought.

574
01:02:05,928 --> 01:02:08,130
If this contract killer
did all his work abroad...

575
01:02:08,155 --> 01:02:10,532
he'd be quite respectable
in England, wouldn't he?

576
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,364
- So?
- Your people operate abroad.

577
01:02:13,437 --> 01:02:15,872
I thought you might have tabs
on a bloke like that.

578
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:17,875
I'll have a look.

579
01:02:20,179 --> 01:02:22,705
Brian, call for you.

580
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:30,924
Thomas.

581
01:02:30,992 --> 01:02:32,926
Yes, that's right.

582
01:02:34,664 --> 01:02:37,395
Is this some sort of bloody joke?

583
01:02:39,303 --> 01:02:40,896
What? Now?

584
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:44,267
Personally?

585
01:02:44,342 --> 01:02:46,243
Yes, I'll...

586
01:03:09,773 --> 01:03:12,436
- The Prime Minister?
- The Prime Minister, sir.

587
01:03:12,512 --> 01:03:15,072
He said if there's
the remotest possibility...

588
01:03:15,147 --> 01:03:17,241
of General de Gaulle's life
being threatened...

589
01:03:17,316 --> 01:03:20,718
by a person of these islands,
then it is to be stopped.

590
01:03:20,788 --> 01:03:23,916
He's given me full powers
and top priority.

591
01:03:23,992 --> 01:03:26,587
- Is this some kind of joke?
- Of course not, sir.

592
01:03:26,661 --> 01:03:28,927
I've got to drop
whatever I'm doing.

593
01:03:28,998 --> 01:03:33,265
I shall need six
of your best men straightaway.

594
01:03:33,337 --> 01:03:36,898
Where's the notification for this?
Where's the proper authority?

595
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:40,243
Yes!

596
01:03:43,816 --> 01:03:47,116
Yes, sir.
Of course, sir.

597
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:58,263
Nothing more than taproom
gossip, I'm afraid.

598
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:00,530
Do you remember Trujillo?

599
01:04:00,604 --> 01:04:04,200
You mean the dictator of some
republic in South America?

600
01:04:04,275 --> 01:04:07,370
Yes, Dominica.
He was killed in 1961.

601
01:04:07,446 --> 01:04:11,713
We got word that an Englishman
may have been mixed up in it.

602
01:04:11,785 --> 01:04:14,219
Just an unconfirmed report,
mind you.

603
01:04:14,288 --> 01:04:18,224
- Did he have a name?
- Charles Harold Calthrop.

604
01:04:18,293 --> 01:04:22,390
He was the Caribbean rep
for a small armaments firm.

605
01:04:22,464 --> 01:04:26,732
According to the rumour,
he was a fantastic shot.

606
01:04:26,804 --> 01:04:29,739
He disappeared
after the assassination.

607
01:04:29,808 --> 01:04:31,901
Nobody knows where he went.

608
01:04:33,645 --> 01:04:36,740
- Is that all there is to go on?
- Afraid so.

609
01:04:36,816 --> 01:04:38,408
Just a name?

610
01:04:41,021 --> 01:04:43,286
What makes you think
it might be him?

611
01:04:43,358 --> 01:04:46,954
Your friend's code name
is Jackal, right?

612
01:04:47,028 --> 01:04:52,434
Jackal in French is chacal.

613
01:04:52,502 --> 01:04:55,802
See? Now it might just
be a coincidence...

614
01:04:55,872 --> 01:04:58,808
but the first three letters
of his Christian name, Charles...

615
01:04:58,877 --> 01:05:03,406
and the first three letters
of Calthrop make up...

616
01:05:17,967 --> 01:05:21,405
That's all the Charles H. Calthrops
way back to 1958.

617
01:05:21,471 --> 01:05:23,906
- How many does that make?
- Twenty-three.

618
01:05:27,346 --> 01:05:29,906
Will you please tell
Commissioner Lebel...

619
01:05:29,982 --> 01:05:33,248
there is a faint possibility,
very faint...

620
01:05:33,319 --> 01:05:37,586
the name is
Charles Harold Calthrop.

621
01:05:37,658 --> 01:05:40,423
That's right. We've checked
with the passport office.

622
01:05:40,495 --> 01:05:43,761
Twenty-three passports were issued
to Charles H. Calthrops...

623
01:05:43,833 --> 01:05:45,767
during the past five years.

624
01:05:45,835 --> 01:05:49,101
We've interviewed
12 of them so far.

625
01:05:49,173 --> 01:05:52,040
Nothing at all,
but I'll keep you posted.

626
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:54,044
Do you have a garage for rent?

627
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,683
Excuse me.

628
01:07:49,755 --> 01:07:52,351
Would you happen to know
where Mr. Charles Calthrop is?

629
01:07:52,426 --> 01:07:54,190
- Mr. Calthrop?
- Yes.

630
01:07:54,262 --> 01:07:58,029
I think he's abroad.
He often is, you know.

631
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:59,692
Thank you.

632
01:07:59,769 --> 01:08:01,794
We better get a search warrant.

633
01:08:18,266 --> 01:08:19,858
What's happening?

634
01:08:28,445 --> 01:08:29,879
Come in.

635
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:35,086
We've been through the lot, sir.
He's away, all right.

636
01:08:36,789 --> 01:08:39,257
Let's see what you've got.

637
01:08:57,981 --> 01:09:01,008
- What's this?
- His passport.

638
01:09:01,086 --> 01:09:03,020
We checked it.
It's him.

639
01:09:03,088 --> 01:09:06,683
Look.
The Dominican visa.

640
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:10,322
There's no exit stamp though.
He must have got out on the sly.

641
01:09:10,397 --> 01:09:13,856
You haven't grasped it yet,
have you?

642
01:09:13,936 --> 01:09:16,700
Yes, this is our man, all right.
Definitely.

643
01:09:16,772 --> 01:09:20,869
But hasn't it occurred to you
that we're holding his passport?

644
01:09:20,944 --> 01:09:24,642
If he is out of the country,
what's he travelling on?

645
01:09:25,951 --> 01:09:28,977
- He might be somewhere in the UK.
- Yes, he might.

646
01:09:29,054 --> 01:09:30,488
Then again, he might not.

647
01:09:30,555 --> 01:09:34,618
He's Charles Harold Calthrop.
Here's his passport photo.

648
01:09:37,465 --> 01:09:39,891
I'll circulate photos
to each of you after the meeting.

649
01:09:40,969 --> 01:09:45,806
Excellent.
Thank you, Commissioner.

650
01:09:47,177 --> 01:09:49,738
It may be this Calthrop
has already entered the country.

651
01:09:49,813 --> 01:09:53,045
He may be staying at a hotel.
Phillison.

652
01:09:53,117 --> 01:09:55,052
- Minister?
- I want every hotel card...

653
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,452
for the past 72 hours
checked by the police.

654
01:09:57,522 --> 01:10:00,082
The same goes for you, Pascal,
with those cards that are filed...

655
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:02,218
- for the greater Paris area.
- Yes, Minister.

656
01:10:02,295 --> 01:10:05,060
Circulate to your staffs
this man's name and photograph.

657
01:10:05,132 --> 01:10:09,537
He must be arrested on sight,
and my office notified at once.

658
01:10:09,604 --> 01:10:11,334
I want every border post...

659
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:15,036
airport, seaport,
fishing village alerted.

660
01:10:15,112 --> 01:10:17,706
- General Colbert.
- Minister?

661
01:10:17,736 --> 01:10:19,264
Calthrop is probably still abroad.

662
01:10:19,289 --> 01:10:22,378
- Get your agents working on that.
- Yes, sir.

663
01:10:22,453 --> 01:10:25,082
In the meantime, complete
silence must be maintained...

664
01:10:25,158 --> 01:10:27,888
until we're sure
the man's in this country.

665
01:10:27,961 --> 01:10:31,090
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night.

666
01:10:39,642 --> 01:10:41,576
Commissioner Lebel's office.

667
01:10:43,647 --> 01:10:45,080
Yes.

668
01:10:49,988 --> 01:10:52,081
Thank you.
Good-bye.

669
01:10:54,494 --> 01:10:58,089
No one called Calthrop has crossed
any border point legally...

670
01:10:58,165 --> 01:11:00,100
since the start of the year.

671
01:11:00,168 --> 01:11:03,194
And no hotel has taken in
a guest under that name.

672
01:11:03,272 --> 01:11:05,707
Maybe he's given up
and gone into hiding.

673
01:11:05,774 --> 01:11:09,871
If the British found
Calthrop's passport in his flat...

674
01:11:09,946 --> 01:11:13,212
it's because
he no longer needed it.

675
01:11:13,284 --> 01:11:15,753
Don't count on that man
making too many errors.

676
01:11:15,821 --> 01:11:17,914
He's not the type.

677
01:11:20,293 --> 01:11:23,057
I'm beginning to get
a feeling about the Jackal.

678
01:11:24,298 --> 01:11:28,258
He may be abroad,
travelling on a false passport.

679
01:11:28,336 --> 01:11:32,102
What you're going to do now is
go down to the passport office.

680
01:11:32,173 --> 01:11:36,077
Get every passport application
for the last three months.

681
01:11:36,146 --> 01:11:38,410
- But, sir...
- I don't care who's closed.

682
01:11:38,483 --> 01:11:40,576
Wake the buggers up.

683
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:43,916
Then take all those papers
down to Somerset House...

684
01:11:43,988 --> 01:11:46,099
get started on checking
the applicants' names...

685
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:49,925
against death certificates,
not birth certificates.

686
01:11:49,997 --> 01:11:53,763
If you find an application filed
by someone who died as a child...

687
01:11:53,834 --> 01:11:57,271
the one who filed it
might be our man.

688
01:11:57,339 --> 01:11:59,765
If you don't find anything
in the first three months...

689
01:11:59,791 --> 01:12:02,368
go back another three
and another three.

690
01:12:02,445 --> 01:12:03,878
Off you go.

691
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:43,595
Yes?

692
01:12:43,663 --> 01:12:45,632
How's it going, Hughes?

693
01:12:47,501 --> 01:12:52,600
How many applications?
8,041?

694
01:12:52,675 --> 01:12:54,609
You'll be there a week.

695
01:12:54,677 --> 01:12:57,272
How about I send you
some more staff?

696
01:12:59,216 --> 01:13:01,275
Bloody holiday season.

697
01:13:09,294 --> 01:13:13,232
About 4,000 more to go,
Mr. Thomas.

698
01:13:13,299 --> 01:13:17,066
But if we work through lunch,
we should be finished tonight.

699
01:13:57,889 --> 01:14:00,585
Superintendent Thomas,
Special Branch.

700
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:06,120
Hughes here, sir.
Paul Oliver Duggan.

701
01:14:06,199 --> 01:14:09,965
Born April 3, 1929,
in Sambourne Fishley.

702
01:14:10,037 --> 01:14:12,598
Applied for passport
July 14 of this year.

703
01:14:12,674 --> 01:14:16,441
Passport mailed July 17
to an address in Paddington.

704
01:14:16,512 --> 01:14:20,074
That will probably turn out
to be an accommodation address.

705
01:14:20,150 --> 01:14:21,584
Why?

706
01:14:21,651 --> 01:14:27,114
Duggan died at the age of two
and a half on November 8, 1931.

707
01:15:01,969 --> 01:15:03,732
Passport, please.

708
01:15:06,807 --> 01:15:08,241
One moment.

709
01:15:18,110 --> 01:15:19,233
- Mr. Duggan?
- Yes?

710
01:15:19,234 --> 01:15:20,597
- Mr. Duggan?
- Yes?

711
01:15:22,036 --> 01:15:24,335
What's the purpose
of your visit to France?

712
01:15:24,406 --> 01:15:26,397
Tourism.

713
01:15:40,725 --> 01:15:43,160
- You buy this in Italy?
- No, it's hired.

714
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:45,893
I shall be returning it
to Genova in about a week.

715
01:15:45,966 --> 01:15:48,128
Papers, please.

716
01:15:51,407 --> 01:15:53,238
Got any luggage?

717
01:15:54,576 --> 01:15:57,546
- In the boot.
- Bring it inside.

718
01:16:36,396 --> 01:16:37,829
Thank you.

719
01:17:04,931 --> 01:17:06,865
Once we've found his new name...

720
01:17:06,933 --> 01:17:09,197
Lebel shouldn't have
any trouble catching him.

721
01:17:09,269 --> 01:17:10,862
It's not that simple.

722
01:17:10,938 --> 01:17:14,705
Over two million foreigners
are in Paris at this time of year.

723
01:17:14,776 --> 01:17:17,041
I'm very sorry, Minister.

724
01:17:19,149 --> 01:17:21,550
Commissioner Lebel
requested this meeting...

725
01:17:21,619 --> 01:17:24,179
because he has new information
on the British suspect.

726
01:17:24,256 --> 01:17:25,689
Commissioner.

727
01:17:25,757 --> 01:17:28,921
Calthrop is travelling
on a false passport...

728
01:17:28,994 --> 01:17:32,557
in the name of Paul Oliver Duggan.

729
01:17:32,633 --> 01:17:37,070
The passport number is 29491.

730
01:17:37,138 --> 01:17:39,368
The photo will reach us
in a few hours.

731
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:41,466
What do we do now?

732
01:17:41,543 --> 01:17:44,945
The Duggan passport
was issued on July 30.

733
01:17:45,015 --> 01:17:47,449
No need to go
further back than that.

734
01:17:47,517 --> 01:17:49,763
Special Branch in Britain
is trying to trace him...

735
01:17:49,789 --> 01:17:53,124
through the passenger lists
of all airlines and ferries.

736
01:17:53,192 --> 01:17:55,524
If they pick him up in Britain,
they'll detain him.

737
01:17:55,594 --> 01:17:58,587
If we locate him inside France,
we arrest him.

738
01:17:58,665 --> 01:18:03,535
If he's found in a third country,
Action Service will deal with him.

739
01:18:03,604 --> 01:18:05,367
- Commissioner...
- In the meantime...

740
01:18:05,439 --> 01:18:08,774
I'll be grateful
if you would do this my way.

741
01:18:26,466 --> 01:18:30,732
Good morning, sir.
Paris, please. Molitor 5901.

742
01:18:30,805 --> 01:18:32,739
Carrier number one, please.

743
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:51,425
The Jackal is blown.
Wolenski talked before dying.

744
01:18:51,497 --> 01:18:53,488
Repeat: the Jackal is blown.

745
01:20:16,303 --> 01:20:18,397
Room 14.
Thank you, Mr. Duggan.

746
01:21:00,657 --> 01:21:02,786
I'll have coffee in the lounge.

747
01:21:19,815 --> 01:21:23,253
Do you mind my sitting here?

748
01:21:25,989 --> 01:21:27,457
Thank you.

749
01:21:37,838 --> 01:21:40,602
Boring, aren't they?

750
01:21:40,675 --> 01:21:43,439
The magazines.

751
01:21:43,511 --> 01:21:46,606
- I find them fascinating.
- What?

752
01:21:46,683 --> 01:21:50,449
Articles on pig breeding
and combine harvesters?

753
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:53,786
I'm enthralled
by combine harvesters.

754
01:21:53,858 --> 01:21:57,098
In fact, I yearn
to have one, as a pet.

755
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:09,945
Yes.

756
01:22:11,183 --> 01:22:14,619
When did you say?
This afternoon.

757
01:22:14,686 --> 01:22:16,780
Repeat that again.

758
01:22:16,855 --> 01:22:21,123
A white Alfa Romeo
sports two-seater...

759
01:22:21,195 --> 01:22:25,792
license number GE 1741.

760
01:22:27,202 --> 01:22:31,641
Duggan crossed the border
at Ventimiglia four hours ago.

761
01:22:31,707 --> 01:22:34,088
Call London and tell them
we'll handle it from now on.

762
01:22:34,114 --> 01:22:36,639
- Where is he?
- How should I know?

763
01:22:36,714 --> 01:22:39,980
This damn secrecy. We'll have
to wait for the hotel cards.

764
01:22:40,052 --> 01:22:43,852
It's madness. There's nothing
we can do about it.

765
01:22:46,092 --> 01:22:48,584
No, of course
I don't live in the Alps.

766
01:22:48,662 --> 01:22:51,325
I went there for a visit,
that's all.

767
01:22:51,399 --> 01:22:53,333
Climbing?

768
01:22:53,402 --> 01:22:56,031
Good Lord, no.

769
01:22:56,104 --> 01:23:00,269
I spent the day at the cadet
academy in Barcelonnette...

770
01:23:00,343 --> 01:23:03,940
amongst a lot
of jaundiced military types...

771
01:23:04,015 --> 01:23:06,677
watching my son
receive his commission.

772
01:23:09,054 --> 01:23:10,989
He's nineteen.

773
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:16,955
I never know
when you're being serious.

774
01:23:17,030 --> 01:23:20,866
- It's true, unfortunately.
- Why "unfortunately"?

775
01:23:23,472 --> 01:23:25,269
I see nothing unfortunate...

776
01:23:25,341 --> 01:23:29,073
I'm not begging for compliments,
Mr. Duggan.

777
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:35,645
- Will you have a liqueur?
- No, I must go to bed.

778
01:23:36,822 --> 01:23:39,815
I have to leave very early
tomorrow morning.

779
01:23:39,892 --> 01:23:42,487
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

780
01:23:44,732 --> 01:23:46,826
Good night, Mr. Duggan.

781
01:26:04,206 --> 01:26:07,142
I've got to leave
in a couple of hours.

782
01:26:07,209 --> 01:26:09,474
I've a long way to go.

783
01:26:09,546 --> 01:26:12,482
You've got to go back
to your room.

784
01:26:12,549 --> 01:26:14,984
Your husband meeting you?

785
01:26:17,055 --> 01:26:19,149
No, he isn't there.

786
01:26:49,762 --> 01:26:51,389
Good morning.

787
01:26:51,464 --> 01:26:53,831
Excuse me, madam.

788
01:26:55,269 --> 01:26:57,533
Only three new guests last night.

789
01:27:02,278 --> 01:27:04,906
All right.
Put them in the rack for Nice.

790
01:27:10,622 --> 01:27:12,557
Cards ready yet?

791
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:32,944
Hello? Nice?

792
01:27:33,016 --> 01:27:36,418
Yes. Repeat, please.

793
01:27:40,025 --> 01:27:42,927
Stay by the phone until
I call back. Don't do a thing.

794
01:27:42,995 --> 01:27:46,090
I don't want him disturbed yet,
but isolate the place.

795
01:27:46,166 --> 01:27:48,930
Let no one in or out
and stop all phone calls.

796
01:27:50,838 --> 01:27:53,933
He's been staying in this hotel
near Grasse since last night.

797
01:27:54,009 --> 01:27:56,774
- He's registered for two days.
- Shall I put out an alert?

798
01:27:56,846 --> 01:27:59,272
Not yet. He'll kill anybody
who tries to intercept him.

799
01:27:59,317 --> 01:28:01,135
We'd better get there right away.

800
01:28:54,133 --> 01:28:56,694
You have an Englishman
named Duggan staying here.

801
01:28:56,770 --> 01:28:58,739
- Where is he?
- Mr. Duggan's gone, sir.

802
01:28:58,806 --> 01:29:01,641
He left this morning,
just after 11:00.

803
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:08,477
Assemble the staff and guests.
Don't let anyone get away.

804
01:29:08,553 --> 01:29:10,180
Get the manager.

805
01:29:13,758 --> 01:29:16,023
That's strange.
He was booked for two days...

806
01:29:16,095 --> 01:29:20,157
then just after 11:00,
he asks for his bill and leaves.

807
01:29:20,233 --> 01:29:24,500
He's got five hours start.
Put out an alert for the car.

808
01:29:43,429 --> 01:29:46,728
But Madame de Montpellier's bed
was slept in by two people?

809
01:29:46,799 --> 01:29:49,234
Yes, sir. Definitely.

810
01:29:49,303 --> 01:29:51,567
You can always tell.

811
01:29:51,639 --> 01:29:54,404
And you saw them
in the lounge together?

812
01:29:54,475 --> 01:29:58,743
That is correct, sir.
I served them coffee and liqueur.

813
01:29:58,815 --> 01:30:01,477
They seemed very engrossed.

814
01:30:01,551 --> 01:30:04,316
- In what?
- In each other, sir.

815
01:30:04,388 --> 01:30:07,654
What did Mr. Duggan's luggage
consist of when he left?

816
01:30:07,726 --> 01:30:10,160
- Two bags.
- Nothing else?

817
01:30:10,229 --> 01:30:12,823
No parcels or packages
of any kind?

818
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:16,336
Just the two bags.
I carried them to his car.

819
01:30:16,403 --> 01:30:18,167
That will be all.

820
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:22,006
- You photographed everything?
- Yes.

821
01:30:22,078 --> 01:30:25,172
Go over his room for fingerprints.
Send the stuff to Paris.

822
01:30:25,247 --> 01:30:27,910
I'll have a talk with the lady.

823
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:53,211
There's more news. They have
a description of your car.

824
01:30:53,282 --> 01:30:55,478
Keep out of sight for a few days.

825
01:33:14,291 --> 01:33:16,887
- How's the lady?
- Very disturbed by all this.

826
01:33:16,962 --> 01:33:18,896
You told her nothing?

827
01:33:39,523 --> 01:33:42,458
I know nothing at all
about Mr. Duggan's whereabouts.

828
01:33:42,527 --> 01:33:44,757
We only met in the lounge
of that hotel.

829
01:33:44,829 --> 01:33:48,061
- He joined me for coffee.
- What did he want?

830
01:33:50,637 --> 01:33:52,572
What did you talk about?

831
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:55,575
Social chitchat. I imagine
he was trying to impress me.

832
01:33:55,643 --> 01:33:57,577
Why do you think that?

833
01:33:57,646 --> 01:34:01,173
Commissioner, please,
we're not children.

834
01:34:01,250 --> 01:34:02,842
No, madam.

835
01:34:04,754 --> 01:34:08,350
When you both met later,
was it only in your bedroom?

836
01:34:11,096 --> 01:34:14,533
- " Later"?
- Afterwards. After the coffee.

837
01:34:19,106 --> 01:34:23,703
Madam, be in no doubt as to
the seriousness of your position.

838
01:34:41,334 --> 01:34:44,064
We met in my bedroom.
That's all.

839
01:34:45,972 --> 01:34:49,431
I'd never seen this man
until yesterday.

840
01:34:49,510 --> 01:34:52,071
He doesn't even know my real name.

841
01:36:07,947 --> 01:36:11,349
I regret to say that
we have lost track of him.

842
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:14,651
Temporarily, I hope.
But he simply disappeared.

843
01:36:19,296 --> 01:36:21,423
Could that mean
he's changed his mind?

844
01:36:21,498 --> 01:36:23,432
We've obviously scared him off.

845
01:36:23,501 --> 01:36:25,594
Is it possible
he's decided to give up?

846
01:36:25,671 --> 01:36:30,267
His only chance to escape is
to get across the border fast.

847
01:36:33,481 --> 01:36:36,245
I think he's still in France.

848
01:36:37,819 --> 01:36:39,412
He may be waiting.

849
01:36:39,488 --> 01:36:41,957
- Waiting for what?
- I don't know.

850
01:36:42,024 --> 01:36:45,461
But I don't think we can assume
that he's given up.

851
01:37:51,443 --> 01:37:52,877
Good morning.

852
01:38:13,305 --> 01:38:15,899
Madam, there is a gentleman...

853
01:38:15,974 --> 01:38:17,408
Surprised?

854
01:38:18,477 --> 01:38:20,275
Thank you, Michel.

855
01:38:22,482 --> 01:38:26,248
- Do that later, Ernestine.
- Yes, madam.

856
01:38:36,666 --> 01:38:38,692
- Yes, I am surprised.
- Why?

857
01:38:38,769 --> 01:38:40,964
Your husband's still away,
isn't he?

858
01:38:43,208 --> 01:38:45,142
Why did you come here?

859
01:38:45,211 --> 01:38:47,145
To see you.

860
01:38:48,215 --> 01:38:50,149
I had to.

861
01:38:50,217 --> 01:38:51,981
But why?

862
01:38:55,123 --> 01:38:56,886
Does it matter?

863
01:39:38,911 --> 01:39:43,281
Make a search of hills,
farmhouses, cafes and hotels...

864
01:39:43,350 --> 01:39:46,945
in a ten-kilometre radius
from the scene of the crash.

865
01:39:47,021 --> 01:39:50,788
Look for a fair-haired, young
foreigner with two suitcases.

866
01:39:50,858 --> 01:39:53,851
He may have been injured
and gone into hiding.

867
01:40:06,813 --> 01:40:10,249
The police were here yesterday
looking for you.

868
01:40:14,522 --> 01:40:18,755
Did they say
they were coming back?

869
01:40:20,162 --> 01:40:23,291
Only that I should phone if...

870
01:40:27,171 --> 01:40:31,632
I know you stole that car.
It has a local license plate.

871
01:40:36,716 --> 01:40:40,153
I know it must be very serious.
I don't mind.

872
01:40:40,221 --> 01:40:42,816
You can tell me what you've done.

873
01:40:42,891 --> 01:40:45,155
You can stay here.
It's safe.

874
01:40:45,227 --> 01:40:49,324
But you must tell me, Paul.
I won't say anything.

875
01:44:02,728 --> 01:44:04,821
Good-bye, Mr. Duggan.

876
01:44:26,591 --> 01:44:29,187
Your coffee, madam.

877
01:44:57,097 --> 01:44:58,689
Madam?

878
01:45:40,150 --> 01:45:43,245
Good morning.
A single ticket to Paris, please.

879
01:45:43,321 --> 01:45:45,414
- What class?
- Second.

880
01:45:46,825 --> 01:45:50,727
- How soon will the train be here?
- In an hour.

881
01:45:50,797 --> 01:45:54,358
- Platform one.
- Thank you.

882
01:46:11,089 --> 01:46:12,716
Your papers.

883
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:23,197
- Danish?
- Please?

884
01:46:23,270 --> 01:46:25,738
- Denmark?
- Yes.

885
01:46:25,806 --> 01:46:27,398
What is your business here?

886
01:46:27,476 --> 01:46:30,469
I'm a schoolteacher on holiday.

887
01:47:17,137 --> 01:47:18,570
Madam?

888
01:48:44,380 --> 01:48:48,283
Commissioner, Madame de Montpellier
has been murdered!

889
01:48:48,350 --> 01:48:50,596
- Do they know who did it?
- It sounds like Duggan.

890
01:48:50,622 --> 01:48:54,218
He arrived at her place yesterday,
but disappeared again with her car.

891
01:48:54,292 --> 01:48:57,729
There's no need for secrecy.
It's a straight murder hunt now.

892
01:48:57,796 --> 01:49:01,790
Put out a general alert for Duggan.
Describe the car.

893
01:49:15,891 --> 01:49:19,727
6:30 time check.
Listen, I've found that car.

894
01:49:25,536 --> 01:49:28,131
The gendarmes by the railway
station say only three men...

895
01:49:28,206 --> 01:49:30,471
boarded the midday train to Paris.

896
01:49:30,543 --> 01:49:31,976
Two were locals...

897
01:49:32,045 --> 01:49:35,982
and the third was a teacher
travelling on a Danish passport.

898
01:49:36,051 --> 01:49:41,148
Age: about 34. Five feet ten,
brown hair, blue eyes.

899
01:49:41,222 --> 01:49:42,815
He can't remember the name.

900
01:49:42,891 --> 01:49:46,659
What time is that train due
at Austerlitz station?

901
01:49:46,730 --> 01:49:48,163
Ten past 7:00.

902
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:51,766
Come on!

903
01:50:32,754 --> 01:50:35,451
- You know a good Turkish bath?
- Of course.

904
01:50:35,524 --> 01:50:36,957
Take me there.

905
01:52:16,683 --> 01:52:20,484
It's obvious that the Jackal
has been tipped off all along.

906
01:52:20,555 --> 01:52:23,320
And yet he's decided
to go ahead, regardless.

907
01:52:23,391 --> 01:52:27,488
He's simply challenged
the whole lot of us.

908
01:52:27,564 --> 01:52:31,466
Are you suggesting there's a leak
from inside this room?

909
01:52:33,236 --> 01:52:35,172
I can't say.

910
01:52:35,239 --> 01:52:39,837
We think the Jackal is now in
Paris with a new name and face...

911
01:52:39,912 --> 01:52:42,905
probably masquerading
as a Danish schoolteacher.

912
01:52:48,956 --> 01:52:52,018
- Minister?
- Can you estimate...

913
01:52:52,093 --> 01:52:55,120
how many Danes might have
entered Paris this afternoon?

914
01:52:55,197 --> 01:52:57,398
Probably several hundred
at this time of the year.

915
01:52:57,424 --> 01:52:59,301
We must check on the men
personally.

916
01:52:59,369 --> 01:53:02,806
I'll have every hotel visited
at midnight and 3:00 AM

917
01:53:02,875 --> 01:53:04,672
All registration cards
will be collected.

918
01:53:04,710 --> 01:53:07,475
Every likely Dane
will be investigated.

919
01:53:07,547 --> 01:53:09,310
Good.

920
01:53:09,382 --> 01:53:11,763
In the meantime, I'll try
to persuade the president...

921
01:53:11,789 --> 01:53:14,053
to cancel all public appearances.

922
01:53:57,576 --> 01:53:59,635
You're getting all steamed up.

923
01:53:59,712 --> 01:54:02,145
I think so.

924
01:54:02,215 --> 01:54:06,151
- I haven't seen you here before.
- No, I'm on holiday from Denmark.

925
01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:09,486
Really?
I know Copenhagen very well.

926
01:54:09,557 --> 01:54:13,995
Unfortunately,
I come from Silkyborge.

927
01:54:14,063 --> 01:54:16,031
It's a very small town.

928
01:54:19,904 --> 01:54:22,532
My name is Jule.
Jule Bernard.

929
01:54:23,608 --> 01:54:25,803
Lundquist.
Perl Lundquist.

930
01:54:27,246 --> 01:54:29,715
Perhaps you would like
to come for a drink at my home?

931
01:54:29,782 --> 01:54:31,683
I live quite nearby.

932
01:54:32,753 --> 01:54:35,017
That would be nice.

933
01:54:40,262 --> 01:54:44,029
So this Jackal
has a Danish passport, right?

934
01:54:46,269 --> 01:54:50,537
- He must have got it somewhere.
- Yes.

935
01:54:55,281 --> 01:54:59,878
If he's had to dye his hair,
it looks as if he stole it.

936
01:54:59,953 --> 01:55:02,889
Yes, go on.

937
01:55:02,957 --> 01:55:05,893
Since his trip to Paris in July,
he's been based in London.

938
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:09,226
The chances are he stole it
in one of those two places.

939
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:13,895
What would you do if you were
a Dane and lost your passport?

940
01:55:13,970 --> 01:55:16,735
I'd go to the consulate.

941
01:55:16,807 --> 01:55:19,401
- Are you calling Thomas?
- Yes.

942
01:55:19,478 --> 01:55:22,971
- Then the Danish Consul in Paris.
- Good.

943
01:55:33,996 --> 01:55:36,430
- How is it going?
- Not well.

944
01:55:36,499 --> 01:55:39,264
678 Danes arrived
in Paris yesterday.

945
01:55:39,336 --> 01:55:43,273
We're interviewing every man
about five feet eight.

946
01:55:43,341 --> 01:55:46,607
No Danish schoolteacher
has turned up though.

947
01:55:46,678 --> 01:55:50,580
- Have the list sent to my office.
- Right.

948
01:55:51,651 --> 01:55:53,449
You are quite right, sir.

949
01:55:53,521 --> 01:55:56,046
A Danish schoolteacher
had his passport stolen...

950
01:55:56,123 --> 01:55:59,559
at London Airport on July 12.

951
01:55:59,628 --> 01:56:03,895
Name: Perl Lundquist
of Copenhagen, age 33.

952
01:56:03,965 --> 01:56:08,700
Five feet ten,
chestnut brown hair, blue eyes.

953
01:56:08,772 --> 01:56:11,674
That's it! That's the one!
Perl Lundquist.

954
01:56:11,743 --> 01:56:15,736
Look him up. Yes?

955
01:56:17,766 --> 01:56:20,530
- There isn't one.
- What?

956
01:56:20,602 --> 01:56:22,537
One moment, Superintendent.

957
01:56:37,757 --> 01:56:39,520
I don't understand it.

958
01:56:39,592 --> 01:56:43,858
There isn't a Lundquist
on the hotels list. Not one.

959
01:56:49,838 --> 01:56:54,469
The following conversation was
recorded at 6:15 this morning.

960
01:56:54,545 --> 01:56:59,141
The number being dialed
was identified as Molitor 5901.

961
01:57:03,555 --> 01:57:06,491
- Hello.
- Yes?

962
01:57:06,559 --> 01:57:08,824
- Denise.
- Valmy here.

963
01:57:08,895 --> 01:57:10,829
They know
he's a Danish schoolteacher.

964
01:57:10,898 --> 01:57:13,332
They're visiting
every hotel in Paris.

965
01:57:14,869 --> 01:57:17,168
The contact was arrested
an hour ago.

966
01:57:17,239 --> 01:57:20,573
Unfortunately, the information
came from this room.

967
01:57:23,246 --> 01:57:25,181
Whose voice was that?

968
01:57:29,287 --> 01:57:32,518
I regret to have
to inform you, Minister...

969
01:57:32,591 --> 01:57:36,029
that it was the voice
of a friend of mine.

970
01:57:36,095 --> 01:57:38,860
She's staying with me
at the moment.

971
01:57:41,603 --> 01:57:43,036
Excuse me.

972
01:57:52,482 --> 01:57:56,147
- I feel we owe you an apology.
- Thank you.

973
01:57:57,956 --> 01:58:02,326
I must report that the president
will not change his mind.

974
01:58:02,395 --> 01:58:03,987
Excuse me.

975
01:58:04,064 --> 01:58:07,556
It's occurred to me that we've
got two days to catch the Jackal.

976
01:58:07,635 --> 01:58:10,333
What? Why?
How do you know?

977
01:58:10,406 --> 01:58:12,499
It was silly of me
not to have seen it before.

978
01:58:12,574 --> 01:58:16,341
The president has no engagements
outside the palace...

979
01:58:16,413 --> 01:58:19,247
- today, tomorrow or Saturday?
- Nothing.

980
01:58:19,316 --> 01:58:21,683
And what is Sunday, August 25?

981
01:58:21,753 --> 01:58:24,120
Of course!
Liberation Day!

982
01:58:24,188 --> 01:58:26,350
That's what he's been waiting for.

983
01:58:26,425 --> 01:58:28,359
We have a little over 48 hours.

984
01:58:28,428 --> 01:58:31,192
We must have been blind,
gentlemen.

985
01:58:31,265 --> 01:58:34,860
All we need is the passport
photograph of Perl Lundquist.

986
01:58:34,936 --> 01:58:38,634
Copenhagen promised to send it
by this evening's conference.

987
01:58:41,945 --> 01:58:44,540
There is one thing.

988
01:58:44,615 --> 01:58:46,879
How did you know
whose telephone to tap?

989
01:58:46,951 --> 01:58:49,716
I didn't, so I tapped all of them.

990
01:59:00,902 --> 01:59:03,530
Are you home already?

991
01:59:12,817 --> 01:59:16,686
We now have the passport
photograph of Perl Lundquist.

992
01:59:16,754 --> 01:59:18,848
The ban on publicity is off.

993
01:59:18,924 --> 01:59:22,019
This is now
a straight murder hunt.

994
01:59:22,094 --> 01:59:25,691
Lundquist's photo will appear
in the papers tomorrow morning.

995
01:59:25,766 --> 01:59:29,225
We'll have news flashes on TV
every 30 minutes.

996
01:59:29,303 --> 01:59:31,239
Every policeman
and CRS man in Paris...

997
01:59:31,306 --> 01:59:33,238
will be on the street
to check the papers...

998
01:59:33,263 --> 01:59:35,906
of anyone remotely
resembling the suspect.

999
01:59:35,978 --> 01:59:38,539
Every detective will be
called off his job to help.

1000
01:59:38,615 --> 01:59:42,052
- How many men does that make?
- Almost a hundred thousand.

1001
01:59:44,289 --> 01:59:46,223
- Commissioner Lebel.
- Yes?

1002
01:59:46,291 --> 01:59:49,556
My congratulations
on the splendid job you've done.

1003
01:59:49,629 --> 01:59:52,223
We shall take over from now on.

1004
01:59:52,299 --> 01:59:56,168
We need detain you no longer.
And, again, thank you.

1005
02:00:38,957 --> 02:00:41,721
- Did you see it?
- See what?

1006
02:00:41,793 --> 02:00:46,231
- Your face on the TV just now.
- What do you mean?

1007
02:00:46,300 --> 02:00:50,236
I was passing a TV rental shop,
and I saw your face.

1008
02:00:50,305 --> 02:00:52,740
- Never.
- Yes.

1009
02:00:56,078 --> 02:00:58,013
Don't turn it off.

1010
02:01:00,250 --> 02:01:02,844
- What was it about?
- I don't know...

1011
02:01:02,919 --> 02:01:05,013
but I swear it was you.

1012
02:01:07,259 --> 02:01:08,692
See?

1013
02:01:14,434 --> 02:01:18,030
We apologize for interrupting
with the following announcement.

1014
02:01:18,106 --> 02:01:20,127
Police are still searching
for the murderer...

1015
02:01:20,153 --> 02:01:21,871
of Madame de Montpellier.

1016
02:01:21,943 --> 02:01:26,040
His name is Perl Lundquist,
and this is his photograph.

1017
02:01:26,116 --> 02:01:30,052
If you have seen this man,
contact the police immediately.

1018
02:02:07,134 --> 02:02:10,035
For God's sake, wake up, will you?

1019
02:02:11,439 --> 02:02:13,874
The minister wants to see you!

1020
02:02:35,969 --> 02:02:39,565
We can't find him.
He's vanished.

1021
02:02:39,641 --> 02:02:42,166
Just disappeared
off the face of the Earth.

1022
02:02:43,478 --> 02:02:46,414
I don't think we had any idea
what kind of man...

1023
02:02:46,482 --> 02:02:50,214
- you have been pursuing.
- What about tomorrow?

1024
02:02:50,287 --> 02:02:53,689
The president rekindles
the eternal flame at 10:00.

1025
02:02:53,758 --> 02:02:57,024
High mass is at 11:00.

1026
02:02:57,096 --> 02:03:00,089
There's only one public ceremony
in the afternoon at 4:00.

1027
02:03:00,166 --> 02:03:04,694
He will present liberation medals
to veterans of the resistance.

1028
02:03:04,772 --> 02:03:06,706
What about crowd control?

1029
02:03:06,774 --> 02:03:10,541
Crowds will be kept back
further than ever before.

1030
02:03:10,612 --> 02:03:14,549
Steel barriers go up several hours
before each ceremony.

1031
02:03:14,617 --> 02:03:17,712
Every house inside the barrier ring
is searched from top to bottom...

1032
02:03:17,788 --> 02:03:19,381
including the sewers.

1033
02:03:19,456 --> 02:03:23,724
Police will be issued special
lapel badges at the last moment...

1034
02:03:23,796 --> 02:03:27,732
in case he tries to masquerade
as a security man.

1035
02:03:29,468 --> 02:03:31,903
There'll be marksmen
inside Notre Dame...

1036
02:03:31,973 --> 02:03:35,067
even among the congregation.

1037
02:03:35,143 --> 02:03:38,740
The priests celebrating mass will
be searched for concealed weapons.

1038
02:03:42,820 --> 02:03:46,084
We'll have firemen and marksmen
on every rooftop...

1039
02:03:46,157 --> 02:03:47,749
along the procession route.

1040
02:03:47,825 --> 02:03:50,586
Dumont has drafted a number
of especially tall officers...

1041
02:03:50,721 --> 02:03:53,884
to hedge around the president
without him noticing.

1042
02:11:38,752 --> 02:11:41,687
- Can I pass, please?
- What for?

1043
02:11:41,755 --> 02:11:43,849
I live there.

1044
02:11:43,925 --> 02:11:47,157
I have a room at 154.

1045
02:11:49,398 --> 02:11:50,832
Papers.

1046
02:12:13,028 --> 02:12:14,791
All right.

1047
02:12:14,863 --> 02:12:16,296
Thank you.

1048
02:12:42,064 --> 02:12:43,497
Excuse me, madam.

1049
02:12:43,566 --> 02:12:46,160
Would you be so kind
as to give me a drink of water?

1050
02:12:46,236 --> 02:12:49,330
Of course. Come in.
Please come in.

1051
02:12:49,406 --> 02:12:52,843
It's hot, waiting for the ceremony.

1052
02:12:54,679 --> 02:12:56,614
Are you getting a medal today?

1053
02:12:56,681 --> 02:12:59,947
I got mine two years
ago with one of my...

1054
02:18:26,715 --> 02:18:28,148
Top floor!

1055
02:19:32,330 --> 02:19:34,161
What do you think you're doing?

1056
02:19:35,399 --> 02:19:37,834
- Who are you?
- Charles Calthrop.

1057
02:19:37,902 --> 02:19:39,837
This is my bloody flat.

1058
02:19:39,905 --> 02:19:43,000
I think you better
come down to the Yard, sir.

1059
02:19:43,076 --> 02:19:45,170
Too bloody right, I will.

1060
02:19:48,617 --> 02:19:50,818
There's no question
of Her Majesty's government...

1061
02:19:50,844 --> 02:19:54,454
ever concealing the fact that
this Jackal was an Englishman.

1062
02:19:54,524 --> 02:19:57,085
So far as one can see,
there was a period...

1063
02:19:57,161 --> 02:19:59,288
when an Englishman
came under suspicion...

1064
02:19:59,363 --> 02:20:01,924
but he has now been cleared.

1065
02:20:01,999 --> 02:20:04,970
Certainly, the Jackal
masqueraded as an Englishman...

1066
02:20:05,036 --> 02:20:08,996
but he also masqueraded
as a Dane and as a Frenchman.

1067
02:20:09,075 --> 02:20:11,669
There's no way of proving
his identity at all.

1068
02:20:11,745 --> 02:20:13,679
But if the Jackal
wasn't Calthrop...

1069
02:20:13,748 --> 02:20:16,376
then who the hell was he?

1070
02:20:19,099 --> 02:20:22,599
