1
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,664
There's a meadow

2
00:00:25,694 --> 00:00:28,494
in my perfect world...

3
00:00:28,534 --> 00:00:31,504
where wind dances
the branches of a tree,

4
00:00:31,534 --> 00:00:36,704
casting leopard spots of light
across the face of a pond.

5
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:39,304
The tree stands tall

6
00:00:39,344 --> 00:00:41,514
and grand and alone,

7
00:00:41,544 --> 00:00:43,714
shading the world beneath it.

8
00:00:56,354 --> 00:00:59,424
It is here, in the cradle
of all I hold dear,

9
00:00:59,464 --> 00:01:02,294
I guard every memory of you.

10
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:08,274
And when I find myself frozen
in the mud of the real,

11
00:01:08,304 --> 00:01:11,704
far from your loving eyes...

12
00:01:11,744 --> 00:01:16,214
I will return to this place,
close mine,

13
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:20,084
and take solace in the simple
perfection of knowing you.

14
00:03:03,854 --> 00:03:05,254
Hey.

15
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:08,654
You got blood on your shirt.

16
00:03:08,694 --> 00:03:11,424
Uh, yeah, I just came from work.

17
00:03:11,464 --> 00:03:13,624
Who was the victim today?

18
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:17,794
Looks like it's gonna be me.

19
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:19,364
Want some coffee?

20
00:03:19,404 --> 00:03:20,434
Sure.

21
00:03:49,164 --> 00:03:52,434
So, I gotta go
to the rez tomorrow.

22
00:03:52,464 --> 00:03:55,604
Figure I'd take Casey by
to see your folks.

23
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:57,874
Hmm.

24
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,774
Something killed a yearling in
the pasture behind their house.

25
00:04:00,814 --> 00:04:02,824
Yeah, that's why I'm going.

26
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:07,614
Don't let Casey
out of your sight on the rez.

27
00:04:07,654 --> 00:04:09,364
- Okay?
- No, like I said,

28
00:04:09,384 --> 00:04:11,484
I'm gonna leave him
with your folks while I scout.

29
00:04:11,524 --> 00:04:13,654
You know, it's too cold
to drag him through the snow,

30
00:04:13,694 --> 00:04:15,934
- so...
- You know what I mean.

31
00:04:15,954 --> 00:04:17,524
Yep.

32
00:04:18,664 --> 00:04:19,864
Yeah.

33
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:22,194
Case!

34
00:04:22,234 --> 00:04:23,534
- Dad?
- Come on, bud.

35
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:26,334
- Okay. I'm coming.
- Time to go.

36
00:04:26,364 --> 00:04:28,174
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa whoa.

37
00:04:28,204 --> 00:04:30,134
What's your BB gun
pointed at right now?

38
00:04:33,244 --> 00:04:34,914
Come here. Come down here.

39
00:04:34,944 --> 00:04:36,244
Sorry, Dad.

40
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:37,844
Hey. What's the rule, bud?

41
00:04:37,884 --> 00:04:40,854
Okay? Gun's always loaded,
even if it ain't.

42
00:04:40,884 --> 00:04:42,354
Right?

43
00:04:42,384 --> 00:04:44,554
- Yes.
- Okay. Come on, buddy.

44
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,554
Put that in the truck. Hurry up.

45
00:04:46,584 --> 00:04:48,654
- Okay.
- Don't run.

46
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:58,434
I'll be back Monday afternoon.

47
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,274
Just be careful
on the road, okay?

48
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:05,304
This won't be
my first snowstorm in a car.

49
00:05:05,344 --> 00:05:07,244
Okay.

50
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:09,374
Is this it?

51
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:11,814
Yeah.

52
00:05:17,324 --> 00:05:18,934
Here you go, buddy.

53
00:05:21,524 --> 00:05:23,794
You know,
it's a good town, Wilma.

54
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,594
They got good schools there.

55
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:27,864
If I get the job,
we're gonna have to talk

56
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,464
about his child support.

57
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:32,544
Jackson's a lot more expensive.

58
00:05:32,564 --> 00:05:34,334
Well, you go get that job,

59
00:05:34,374 --> 00:05:36,234
and we'll figure it out
from there.

60
00:05:36,274 --> 00:05:37,834
Don't you worry about it.

61
00:05:37,874 --> 00:05:40,804
Take Togwotee Pass.

62
00:05:40,844 --> 00:05:42,874
And don't go
through Pinedale, okay?

63
00:05:42,914 --> 00:05:46,284
This, uh, this storm's comin'
from the south, so...

64
00:05:46,314 --> 00:05:50,214
Yeah, you couldn't drag me
through Pinedale with a rope.

65
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:54,754
I'll never
set foot in that town again.

66
00:05:55,924 --> 00:05:57,954
Well, good luck, okay?

67
00:06:03,604 --> 00:06:05,514
Better hurry it up...
it's hungry.

68
00:06:09,974 --> 00:06:12,544
Chow time, boys.

69
00:06:16,674 --> 00:06:17,714
You okay?

70
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:18,784
Fine.

71
00:06:19,984 --> 00:06:21,554
You gotta push his nose back

72
00:06:21,584 --> 00:06:23,554
when he rubs up on you
like that.

73
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:24,654
- Okay?
- 'Kay.

74
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,824
Yuck.

75
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,824
Told you I'd get that hat dirty.

76
00:06:28,854 --> 00:06:31,464
He's got the height advantage
on me is the deal.

77
00:06:31,494 --> 00:06:32,764
Is that right?

78
00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:34,464
Well, let's fix that.

79
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,894
Come on.

80
00:06:36,934 --> 00:06:38,904
You're gonna earn
his respect, buddy.

81
00:06:38,934 --> 00:06:40,904
You know how you do that?

82
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:43,004
By standing your own ground.

83
00:06:43,034 --> 00:06:45,004
So, let's get you up on there.

84
00:06:45,044 --> 00:06:46,674
So, like I showed you, right?

85
00:06:46,704 --> 00:06:48,314
Up.

86
00:06:48,344 --> 00:06:51,484
Who's got
the height advantage now?

87
00:06:51,514 --> 00:06:53,484
Huh? Who's got
the height advantage?

88
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:55,584
Let's back him up.

89
00:06:55,614 --> 00:06:56,854
Be gentle.

90
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,624
Till he tells you not to be.

91
00:06:58,654 --> 00:07:01,394
Take him around.

92
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,694
That's it.

93
00:07:06,724 --> 00:07:07,894
Pass right by his food.

94
00:07:07,934 --> 00:07:09,774
Keep on going, keep on going.

95
00:07:09,794 --> 00:07:12,034
There you go.
You show him who's boss.

96
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,474
Want to sidepass him
over this way?

97
00:07:14,504 --> 00:07:16,334
Whoa.

98
00:07:19,044 --> 00:07:21,474
There you go.

99
00:07:21,514 --> 00:07:23,074
That's it, son.

100
00:07:25,914 --> 00:07:27,414
Keep coming.

101
00:07:27,454 --> 00:07:28,624
Back him up.

102
00:07:28,654 --> 00:07:30,784
He wants the food. Back him up.

103
00:07:30,824 --> 00:07:32,794
Look at that.

104
00:07:32,824 --> 00:07:34,054
All right, come on in.

105
00:07:34,094 --> 00:07:35,864
How about that!

106
00:07:35,894 --> 00:07:38,024
Good job. Come over here.

107
00:07:38,064 --> 00:07:39,834
Put your hand up on his nose.

108
00:07:39,864 --> 00:07:41,634
Let him smell you,
let him breathe you,

109
00:07:41,664 --> 00:07:42,964
let him know you.

110
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:44,834
He'll love you forever.

111
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,704
Okay?

112
00:07:51,144 --> 00:07:52,614
Hey.

113
00:07:52,644 --> 00:07:54,774
So, what do you think
of that, son?

114
00:07:54,814 --> 00:07:56,814
That was pretty cowboy, huh?

115
00:07:58,444 --> 00:07:59,484
No, son.

116
00:07:59,514 --> 00:08:01,884
That was all Arapaho.

117
00:08:36,454 --> 00:08:39,554
Hey, grandson! Hey!

118
00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:41,724
Grandma's making you fry bread.

119
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,854
- Did you have breakfast?
- Just eggs.

120
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,864
Well, go ahead, get you some!

121
00:08:51,034 --> 00:08:53,704
- Horses sense the storm, huh?
- Yeah.

122
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:56,674
So, uh, police chief call you
to hunt the lion, eh?

123
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:59,004
Well, he called me
to hunt something.

124
00:08:59,044 --> 00:09:01,444
- Yeah.
- Heard you lost a steer.

125
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,444
Yeah. I'll show you where.

126
00:09:03,484 --> 00:09:05,494
- It's a lion.
- Is that right?

127
00:09:05,514 --> 00:09:07,744
Come on.

128
00:09:07,784 --> 00:09:09,754
How's Wilma?

129
00:09:09,784 --> 00:09:12,154
She got a job interview
in Jackson.

130
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,054
Some hotel, I think.

131
00:09:14,094 --> 00:09:16,064
- Jackson Hole.
- Yeah.

132
00:09:16,094 --> 00:09:18,054
Going to live
with the millionaires, eh?

133
00:09:18,094 --> 00:09:20,064
Well, I don't know about that.

134
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:21,564
I think the billionaires

135
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,234
chased out the millionaires
years ago.

136
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,234
Well, save your money.

137
00:09:26,264 --> 00:09:29,874
When the wolves start eating
their golden retrievers,

138
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:33,504
that land's gonna go
for pennies on the dollar.

139
00:09:35,874 --> 00:09:37,174
Yes, sir.

140
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,884
Tell me what that is.

141
00:09:52,624 --> 00:09:54,164
Yeah.

142
00:09:57,534 --> 00:10:00,064
Well, it's a lion, all right.

143
00:10:00,104 --> 00:10:02,234
There's two.

144
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,074
Three of 'em.

145
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:08,914
She's got both
of last year's kits with her.

146
00:10:08,944 --> 00:10:11,744
They chased your steer around
for a while, it seems.

147
00:10:11,784 --> 00:10:13,514
That's what the tracks say.

148
00:10:13,554 --> 00:10:17,964
Mama's teaching her kids
how to hunt.

149
00:10:26,924 --> 00:10:29,634
She's teaching them
on livestock.

150
00:10:29,664 --> 00:10:32,704
Mama just got
her whole family killed.

151
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:42,574
You got gas in your sled?

152
00:14:36,344 --> 00:14:39,984
Hey. I need
emergency assistance.

153
00:14:40,014 --> 00:14:42,854
Repeat,
emergency assistance requested.

154
00:14:42,884 --> 00:14:45,254
Come back.

155
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:46,900
Fremont County Sheriff's Office.

156
00:14:46,924 --> 00:14:48,254
What's your location?

157
00:14:48,294 --> 00:14:50,934
The Wind River
Indian Reservation,

158
00:14:50,964 --> 00:14:53,204
east of Boulder Flats.

159
00:14:55,434 --> 00:14:58,864
FBI taking a while, eh?

160
00:14:58,904 --> 00:15:00,934
Yeah, the road
out of Riverton's bad.

161
00:15:00,974 --> 00:15:03,814
I don't want to move her
until they have a look,

162
00:15:03,844 --> 00:15:06,484
but I'm not gonna try
to pull her out after dark.

163
00:15:06,504 --> 00:15:09,944
We gotta get
this show on the road.

164
00:15:09,974 --> 00:15:13,014
We're losing the tracks, Ben.

165
00:15:13,044 --> 00:15:15,854
Well, it is coming down
pretty good.

166
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,554
You should let me follow 'em
while I still can.

167
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:21,224
Can't let you do that,

168
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:25,094
until it's okayed
by the FBI, Cory.

169
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,264
You call her folks yet?

170
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:30,264
No. I want to take the body
to Lander.

171
00:15:30,294 --> 00:15:32,164
I know it looks like Natalie...

172
00:15:32,204 --> 00:15:34,234
It's Natalie.

173
00:15:44,214 --> 00:15:46,284
There's your Feds.

174
00:15:47,284 --> 00:15:50,514
Where are these fools going?

175
00:15:50,554 --> 00:15:54,284
- They can't see the road.
- We don't have time for this.

176
00:15:55,424 --> 00:15:58,094
I'll get 'em.

177
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,094
Your destination is on the left.

178
00:16:00,124 --> 00:16:02,434
Turn left.

179
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:08,234
- You FBI?
- Are you tribal police?

180
00:16:08,274 --> 00:16:11,114
No, I'm here to take you
to them.

181
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:13,054
Look, they're very close.
Just follow me, okay?

182
00:16:13,074 --> 00:16:15,244
Yeah.

183
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:34,994
I'm Jane Banner.

184
00:16:35,964 --> 00:16:37,334
You by yourself?

185
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:39,334
Yeah. It's just me.

186
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:41,974
I'm Ben Shoyo...
I'm the tribal police chief.

187
00:16:42,004 --> 00:16:45,444
That's Cory Lambert,
with Fish and Wildlife.

188
00:16:45,474 --> 00:16:46,650
He's the one who found the body.

189
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:50,414
And this is his, uh,
father-in-law, Dan.

190
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:53,084
He don't do nothin'.

191
00:16:53,114 --> 00:16:55,184
We got the same job, eh?

192
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,954
Well, um, I'm sorry to meet
under these circumstances.

193
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:01,224
So, do you want
to show me the body?

194
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:02,970
I don't mean to be rude...
I'm just freezing

195
00:17:02,994 --> 00:17:05,264
my ass off here, so...
the quicker, the-the better.

196
00:17:05,294 --> 00:17:07,040
Yeah? Well,
that's gonna get a lot worse

197
00:17:07,064 --> 00:17:08,694
if you go out there
dressed like that.

198
00:17:08,734 --> 00:17:10,704
The body's five miles
on snowmobile.

199
00:17:10,734 --> 00:17:13,564
I'm afraid you'd be dead
by the time we got there.

200
00:17:13,604 --> 00:17:16,234
Okay. I-I got the call
when I was at a weapons course

201
00:17:16,274 --> 00:17:18,604
in Riverton, so this is...
this is what I've got.

202
00:17:18,644 --> 00:17:20,584
Well, you should have
a winter gear bag

203
00:17:20,604 --> 00:17:22,144
- in that truck.
- Well, um, no,

204
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,520
that's not a government
vehicle, it's a rental.

205
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:25,184
I flew in from Vegas.

206
00:17:25,214 --> 00:17:27,084
So I'm just the closest agent
to the scene.

207
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:28,430
You don't...
you don't think I can...

208
00:17:28,454 --> 00:17:30,194
I can make it?

209
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:32,224
- Oh, you're from Vegas?
- No, I'm not... I'm not

210
00:17:32,254 --> 00:17:33,360
from Vegas; I'm stationed there.

211
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:34,554
I'm from Fort Lauderdale.

212
00:17:34,594 --> 00:17:36,634
I'm sorry, if we're gonna keep

213
00:17:36,654 --> 00:17:38,200
- having this conversation...
- Let's get you fixed up inside.

214
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,464
- It's gonna be great.
- Thanks.

215
00:17:39,494 --> 00:17:40,664
Sorry. Excuse me.

216
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:43,064
Thanks.

217
00:17:43,094 --> 00:17:45,464
- See what they send us?
- Yeah.

218
00:17:50,174 --> 00:17:53,474
Thermals can make underwear
wedge up your bottom.

219
00:17:53,504 --> 00:17:57,344
But I guess yours
are already there.

220
00:17:58,414 --> 00:18:00,014
Here, these should fit.

221
00:18:00,044 --> 00:18:01,244
You're skinny.

222
00:18:01,284 --> 00:18:03,154
Thank you.

223
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,394
Do you have gloves?

224
00:18:14,434 --> 00:18:16,274
No.

225
00:18:16,294 --> 00:18:20,264
Goodness. What were
they thinking sending you here?

226
00:18:24,674 --> 00:18:26,244
Thank you.

227
00:18:28,044 --> 00:18:30,374
And you bring them back
the minute you're done.

228
00:18:30,414 --> 00:18:32,084
They were my granddaughter's.

229
00:18:32,114 --> 00:18:33,344
They ain't a gift.

230
00:18:33,384 --> 00:18:36,184
You hear me?

231
00:18:36,214 --> 00:18:38,214
Yeah, of course.

232
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,124
Okay.

233
00:18:51,504 --> 00:18:52,614
'Kay.

234
00:18:52,634 --> 00:18:54,334
Hey, buddy.

235
00:18:55,304 --> 00:18:57,374
Um... I'm gonna need

236
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:59,574
a couple more hours, for work.

237
00:18:59,604 --> 00:19:01,144
A couple.

238
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:03,044
This is our day.

239
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:05,514
I promise. Okay?

240
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,614
Okay.

241
00:19:07,644 --> 00:19:09,714
- Hang with Grandpa.
- It's letting up. Let's go.

242
00:19:53,164 --> 00:19:56,234
God, it was a blizzard
20 minutes ago.

243
00:19:56,264 --> 00:19:57,794
Well, it comes in waves.

244
00:19:57,834 --> 00:19:59,534
Could be sunny for an hour,

245
00:19:59,564 --> 00:20:01,664
then you're
right back in hell again.

246
00:20:01,704 --> 00:20:03,534
The storm'll be back.

247
00:20:03,574 --> 00:20:07,244
- That's something to look forward to.
- Yeah. Over here.

248
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,444
You got a positive ID?

249
00:20:11,484 --> 00:20:13,354
Not positive, no.

250
00:20:13,384 --> 00:20:15,454
Natalie Hanson.

251
00:20:15,484 --> 00:20:17,654
We'll call that positive
for now.

252
00:20:20,284 --> 00:20:23,424
Does she live close by?

253
00:20:24,564 --> 00:20:25,834
Yeah. Fort Wakashie.

254
00:20:25,864 --> 00:20:27,694
It's to the north a ways.

255
00:20:27,724 --> 00:20:29,534
What's "a ways"?

256
00:20:29,564 --> 00:20:32,464
About a 30-minute drive.

257
00:20:32,504 --> 00:20:34,504
Okay, well,
she didn't run from home, then.

258
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:39,444
No one reported her missing?
Her parents...?

259
00:20:39,474 --> 00:20:41,244
Nope.

260
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:49,654
Yeah. That's why we called you.

261
00:20:49,684 --> 00:20:52,654
How experienced is your
medical examiner?

262
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:55,924
Let's just say he...
he stays busy.

263
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:58,354
Uh, order a rape kit.

264
00:20:58,394 --> 00:20:59,600
When he's done with the prelim,

265
00:20:59,624 --> 00:21:01,194
I want her body sent
to Loveland.

266
00:21:01,234 --> 00:21:02,904
And make sure
her belongings go with her,

267
00:21:02,934 --> 00:21:05,464
'cause they need
to get tested, too.

268
00:21:06,604 --> 00:21:09,574
I'm listing this as a homicide.

269
00:21:13,204 --> 00:21:16,474
How well do you know this land?

270
00:21:16,514 --> 00:21:18,314
Like it's my job.

271
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:20,184
'Cause it is.

272
00:21:20,214 --> 00:21:22,514
Well, is there anywhere
she could be running from?

273
00:21:22,554 --> 00:21:23,884
Is there anything close by?

274
00:21:23,914 --> 00:21:26,784
Nearest house is three
and a half miles from here.

275
00:21:26,824 --> 00:21:28,624
- Southeast.
- Sam Littlefeather's place

276
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,224
is over there.

277
00:21:30,254 --> 00:21:32,764
Yep.

278
00:21:32,794 --> 00:21:34,824
Those boys could use
some serious looking into.

279
00:21:34,864 --> 00:21:37,664
There are no structures closer?

280
00:21:37,694 --> 00:21:39,634
There's a drill rig
five miles from here.

281
00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:42,604
They got trailers
for the workers, but...

282
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,404
- that's closed for the winter.
- Okay, so why would

283
00:21:45,444 --> 00:21:47,874
a teenage girl be out here?

284
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,774
Well, kids come out here
on their snow machines,

285
00:21:50,814 --> 00:21:53,914
and, uh, have a big party
in the snow.

286
00:21:53,944 --> 00:21:56,784
Not barefoot, they don't.

287
00:21:59,754 --> 00:22:01,284
What do you think?

288
00:22:01,324 --> 00:22:03,524
I only know what the tracks say.

289
00:22:03,554 --> 00:22:05,394
Okay, well, that's all we got.

290
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,394
Well, come here, I'll show you.

291
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:14,634
Over here. See this one?
See how the toes turned out,

292
00:22:14,674 --> 00:22:16,584
the front is much deeper
than the back?

293
00:22:16,604 --> 00:22:17,734
That says she was running.

294
00:22:17,774 --> 00:22:19,804
Come here. I'll show you.

295
00:22:21,044 --> 00:22:23,614
She ran until she dropped here.

296
00:22:23,644 --> 00:22:27,484
See the pool of blood
where her face hit the snow.

297
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:30,684
Now, it gets 20 below
here at night,

298
00:22:30,714 --> 00:22:33,784
so if you fill your lungs up
with that cold air

299
00:22:33,824 --> 00:22:36,354
when you're running,
you could freeze 'em up.

300
00:22:36,394 --> 00:22:39,724
Your lungs fill up with blood,
you start coughing it up.

301
00:22:39,764 --> 00:22:41,964
So wherever she came from...

302
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:46,764
...she ran all the way here.

303
00:22:46,804 --> 00:22:49,634
Her lungs burst here.

304
00:22:49,674 --> 00:22:51,804
And she curled up
in that tree line

305
00:22:51,844 --> 00:22:53,884
and drowned in her own blood.

306
00:22:53,904 --> 00:22:55,644
Well, how far do you think

307
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,544
someone could run barefoot
out here?

308
00:23:00,044 --> 00:23:03,454
Oh, I don't know, I...

309
00:23:03,484 --> 00:23:06,384
How do you gauge
someone's will to live?

310
00:23:06,424 --> 00:23:08,954
Especially in these conditions.

311
00:23:10,454 --> 00:23:12,494
But I knew that girl.

312
00:23:13,764 --> 00:23:15,794
She's a fighter.

313
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:20,334
So no matter
how far you think she ran,

314
00:23:20,364 --> 00:23:22,734
I can guarantee you
she ran further.

315
00:23:25,444 --> 00:23:27,744
I got to get back to my son.

316
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:34,584
Hey, um... would you
be willing to help me?

317
00:23:36,784 --> 00:23:40,654
Hey, can he assist
on this investigation?

318
00:23:40,684 --> 00:23:42,324
What?

319
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:43,754
He doesn't work for me.

320
00:23:43,794 --> 00:23:46,364
And you got a lion to kill,
don't forget.

321
00:23:46,394 --> 00:23:48,794
There's three of 'em...
and I didn't.

322
00:23:48,834 --> 00:23:52,874
Sorry, what is it...
what is it that you do again?

323
00:23:52,904 --> 00:23:54,334
I'm a hunter.

324
00:23:54,374 --> 00:23:56,384
You're a lion hunter?

325
00:23:56,404 --> 00:23:59,574
I hunt predators.

326
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:03,644
Good. So why don't you
come hunt one for me, then?

327
00:24:04,684 --> 00:24:06,424
Okay.

328
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,824
Hey, bud.

329
00:24:50,854 --> 00:24:53,524
What happened? You can't sleep?

330
00:24:53,564 --> 00:24:55,764
Had a nightmare.

331
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:58,094
That right? What about?

332
00:25:01,034 --> 00:25:03,474
Who was she?

333
00:25:04,974 --> 00:25:07,804
Come here, buddy.

334
00:25:12,084 --> 00:25:15,724
- Want some milk?
- No.

335
00:25:15,754 --> 00:25:18,614
Well...

336
00:25:18,654 --> 00:25:21,454
she was a girl that just lost
her way in the snow.

337
00:25:21,494 --> 00:25:24,904
That's all. Okay?

338
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:27,094
What's all this?

339
00:25:27,124 --> 00:25:29,664
That's work, buddy.

340
00:25:32,534 --> 00:25:34,934
Did she die like Emily?

341
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:39,404
She died from the cold.

342
00:25:40,744 --> 00:25:43,114
So she died like Emily.

343
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,044
Yeah, son.

344
00:25:47,084 --> 00:25:49,654
I'm afraid she did.

345
00:26:00,124 --> 00:26:01,764
Hi. Sorry.

346
00:26:03,734 --> 00:26:05,534
Yeah.

347
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,204
See you found town okay.

348
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:09,034
Yeah, barely.

349
00:26:09,074 --> 00:26:10,784
Did the family
identify the body?

350
00:26:10,804 --> 00:26:12,844
Yeah.

351
00:26:12,874 --> 00:26:16,244
Did they give you a reason
for not reporting her missing?

352
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:18,744
Well, she stayed
with a boyfriend some.

353
00:26:18,784 --> 00:26:20,624
They didn't think anything
of it.

354
00:26:20,644 --> 00:26:23,014
She was 18,
free to do what she wanted.

355
00:26:23,054 --> 00:26:25,114
Okay, Randy,
you're on the clock.

356
00:26:25,154 --> 00:26:28,224
I got about five minutes
of this in me, so let's go.

357
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:30,824
I'll be quick. Morning.

358
00:26:30,854 --> 00:26:33,224
Randy Whitehurst.
I'm the medical examiner.

359
00:26:33,264 --> 00:26:36,864
I'm-I'm Jane Banner, FBI.

360
00:26:36,894 --> 00:26:38,734
Uh, as you can see here,

361
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,964
she suffered a deep laceration
along her brow line.

362
00:26:41,004 --> 00:26:43,034
Two separated ribs.

363
00:26:43,074 --> 00:26:45,844
Frostbite in both feet
up through her ankles,

364
00:26:45,874 --> 00:26:48,644
frostbite on her nose
and on her left hand.

365
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:51,174
Uh, the frostbite
on her feet is stage four.

366
00:26:51,214 --> 00:26:52,814
You can tell by the bluing here.

367
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:54,184
You see that?

368
00:26:54,214 --> 00:26:55,784
Yeah.

369
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:58,584
Uh, vaginal wall is torn
in different depths.

370
00:26:58,624 --> 00:27:00,694
You think there are
multiple assailants?

371
00:27:00,724 --> 00:27:02,284
Can't determine that.

372
00:27:02,324 --> 00:27:04,724
Could be one assailant who
assaulted her multiple times.

373
00:27:04,764 --> 00:27:07,174
Uh, I swabbed her
and sent the sample by courier

374
00:27:07,194 --> 00:27:09,594
to the FBI crime lab
in Loveland, Colorado

375
00:27:09,634 --> 00:27:11,264
per your request.

376
00:27:11,294 --> 00:27:14,064
We should have the DNA results
in six weeks.

377
00:27:14,104 --> 00:27:17,304
Uh, those findings might help
us make that determination.

378
00:27:17,334 --> 00:27:19,704
What are you listing
as the cause of death?

379
00:27:19,744 --> 00:27:21,844
Well, you're not gonna like it.

380
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:24,144
She died
from a pulmonary hemorrhage.

381
00:27:24,174 --> 00:27:28,714
When... subzero air
is drawn into the lungs,

382
00:27:28,754 --> 00:27:30,094
it can cause the alveoli...

383
00:27:30,114 --> 00:27:32,114
the tiny sacs in the lungs...
to burst.

384
00:27:32,154 --> 00:27:35,284
Fluid builds in the lungs,
and if the air is cold enough,

385
00:27:35,324 --> 00:27:37,294
the liquid in the lungs
will crystallize.

386
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:39,054
Ultimately, the victim either...

387
00:27:39,094 --> 00:27:41,164
Sorry, you're not listing this
as a homicide?

388
00:27:41,194 --> 00:27:42,864
Can't.

389
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:45,294
Uh, s... You have to take

390
00:27:45,334 --> 00:27:47,164
into consideration
the circumstances.

391
00:27:47,204 --> 00:27:51,134
She was raped repeatedly,
beaten...

392
00:27:51,174 --> 00:27:55,844
Look, uh, circumstances
is your field, not mine.

393
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,644
- Now, let me... let me show you.
- No.

394
00:27:57,674 --> 00:27:58,874
I don't need it explained.

395
00:27:58,914 --> 00:28:00,744
This is very prosecutable
as a murder.

396
00:28:00,784 --> 00:28:02,314
I mean, clearly,
she wouldn't have been

397
00:28:02,354 --> 00:28:04,624
running through the snow
if she hadn't been attacked,

398
00:28:04,654 --> 00:28:07,654
but I can't list the cause
of death as homicide.

399
00:28:07,684 --> 00:28:09,624
And I can't get an FBI team
to the reservation

400
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:11,194
unless it's listed
as a homicide.

401
00:28:11,224 --> 00:28:13,064
Look, I'm not here
to solve this.

402
00:28:13,094 --> 00:28:15,634
I'm-I'm just here
to obtain a cause of death

403
00:28:15,664 --> 00:28:17,864
- and send a team here that can.
- Look, present

404
00:28:17,894 --> 00:28:20,164
the rape, present the assault,
and I'm...

405
00:28:20,204 --> 00:28:22,264
Those don't fall
to the jurisdiction of the FBI.

406
00:28:22,304 --> 00:28:25,104
They fall to the Bureau
of Indian Affairs.

407
00:28:30,044 --> 00:28:33,684
Huh. Hey, don't look at me.
I'm used to no help.

408
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:36,084
You have six officers
on your entire force

409
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,114
to cover an area the size
of Rhode Island.

410
00:28:38,154 --> 00:28:39,684
Yes, I know that.

411
00:28:39,724 --> 00:28:42,154
No offense,
but this will have to curl up

412
00:28:42,194 --> 00:28:44,664
in your lap
in order for you to solve it.

413
00:28:44,694 --> 00:28:46,764
- I know that, too.
- We all know

414
00:28:46,794 --> 00:28:48,094
it's a murder.

415
00:28:48,124 --> 00:28:50,364
All right, have a U.S. Attorney
sign off on it,

416
00:28:50,394 --> 00:28:53,164
I'm happy to corroborate that,
but I just can't put it

417
00:28:53,204 --> 00:28:54,834
on the death certificate.

418
00:28:54,874 --> 00:28:57,814
Okay.

419
00:28:57,834 --> 00:28:59,874
Thank you.

420
00:29:11,254 --> 00:29:12,824
I appreciate your passion.

421
00:29:12,854 --> 00:29:15,084
It's not the Feds'
usual response,

422
00:29:15,124 --> 00:29:18,024
but Randy is on our side.

423
00:29:18,054 --> 00:29:21,024
When my supervisor sees
his report,

424
00:29:21,064 --> 00:29:23,194
he's gonna want me back
in Vegas.

425
00:29:23,234 --> 00:29:26,334
Not that... I'm much help
or anything, but...

426
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:28,904
...I'm all you've got.

427
00:29:38,314 --> 00:29:39,884
Yeah.

428
00:29:48,224 --> 00:29:51,354
So you never met him.

429
00:29:51,394 --> 00:29:52,924
No.

430
00:29:52,964 --> 00:29:54,864
And she never talked about him?

431
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:56,894
Not to me.

432
00:29:56,934 --> 00:29:59,194
So why would you let
your daughter stay

433
00:29:59,234 --> 00:30:02,164
with a guy you've never met
whose name you don't even know?

434
00:30:02,204 --> 00:30:03,804
She was an adult.

435
00:30:03,834 --> 00:30:05,104
Barely.

436
00:30:05,144 --> 00:30:07,814
Oh.

437
00:30:07,844 --> 00:30:09,304
I'm sorry. What does that mean?

438
00:30:09,344 --> 00:30:11,274
It ain't good.

439
00:30:11,314 --> 00:30:14,414
Ah. Um, look...

440
00:30:14,444 --> 00:30:18,154
I don't mean to offend you.

441
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:23,154
I am just trying to understand
the dynamic here, Mr. Hanson.

442
00:30:23,194 --> 00:30:24,494
I'm trying to help.

443
00:30:24,524 --> 00:30:26,924
Why is it whenever
you people try to help,

444
00:30:26,964 --> 00:30:29,264
it starts with insults?

445
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:32,164
I don't know why
she didn't tell me,

446
00:30:32,204 --> 00:30:36,014
but she was 18,
and I chose to trust her.

447
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,904
I chose wrong.

448
00:30:37,934 --> 00:30:41,474
Okay, well, um,
how about... your wife?

449
00:30:41,504 --> 00:30:43,144
Did your daughter talk to her?

450
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,474
Do you talk to your mother?

451
00:30:44,514 --> 00:30:47,114
Her name is Annie? Is she here?

452
00:30:47,144 --> 00:30:48,444
She's in the bedroom.

453
00:30:48,484 --> 00:30:50,214
Good. I'd like to speak to her.

454
00:30:50,254 --> 00:30:51,814
Be my guest.

455
00:30:51,854 --> 00:30:53,324
Thank you.

456
00:30:53,354 --> 00:30:55,894
- Bedroom's just this way?
- That way.

457
00:30:57,324 --> 00:31:01,064
- Jane?
- Yeah.

458
00:31:01,094 --> 00:31:02,994
You don't mind, right?

459
00:31:03,034 --> 00:31:04,794
Hey, you don't need
my permission.

460
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:07,204
You're an adult.

461
00:31:07,234 --> 00:31:10,274
Barely.

462
00:31:26,554 --> 00:31:28,024
Jane?

463
00:31:51,044 --> 00:31:53,784
I'm-I'm really sorry.

464
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:16,874
Hey.

465
00:32:57,214 --> 00:32:59,574
I'd like to tell you
it gets easier.

466
00:33:00,914 --> 00:33:03,254
It doesn't.

467
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,124
If there's any...

468
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:12,124
comfort, it's...

469
00:33:12,164 --> 00:33:15,004
getting used to the pain,
I suppose.

470
00:33:21,204 --> 00:33:24,534
Went to a grief seminar
in Casper.

471
00:33:25,674 --> 00:33:28,474
Did you know that?

472
00:33:28,504 --> 00:33:31,044
I don't know why.

473
00:33:32,684 --> 00:33:36,694
Just wanted the bad to go away.

474
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:40,254
Wanted answers... to questions
that couldn't be answered.

475
00:33:43,394 --> 00:33:46,224
The counselor come up to me
after the seminar

476
00:33:46,264 --> 00:33:50,164
and sat down next to me.

477
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,894
And he said something
that stuck with me.

478
00:33:54,664 --> 00:33:57,274
I don't know
if it's what he said,

479
00:33:57,304 --> 00:33:59,674
or it's how he said it.

480
00:34:04,414 --> 00:34:08,944
He says, "I got some good news,
and I got some bad news."

481
00:34:08,984 --> 00:34:11,984
"Bad news is you're never
gonna be the same."

482
00:34:12,024 --> 00:34:15,964
"You're never gonna be whole,
not ever again."

483
00:34:15,994 --> 00:34:18,694
"Your lost your daughter."

484
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,994
"Nothing's ever going
to replace that."

485
00:34:21,024 --> 00:34:22,994
"Now the good news is,"

486
00:34:23,034 --> 00:34:27,004
"as soon as you accept that,
and you let yourself suffer..."

487
00:34:34,344 --> 00:34:37,074
"...you allow yourself
to visit her in your mind,

488
00:34:37,114 --> 00:34:40,584
"and you'll remember
all the love she gave,

489
00:34:40,614 --> 00:34:43,654
all the joy she knew."

490
00:34:47,384 --> 00:34:51,224
Point is, Martin,
you can't steer from the pain.

491
00:34:52,764 --> 00:34:55,304
If you do,
you'll rob yourself...

492
00:35:00,304 --> 00:35:05,004
You'll rob yourself
of every memory of her.

493
00:35:05,044 --> 00:35:08,154
Every last one.

494
00:35:08,174 --> 00:35:10,474
From her first step

495
00:35:10,514 --> 00:35:13,114
to her last smile.

496
00:35:14,084 --> 00:35:15,614
Kill 'em all.

497
00:35:18,114 --> 00:35:20,324
Just take the pain, Martin.

498
00:35:20,354 --> 00:35:22,654
You hear me?

499
00:35:22,694 --> 00:35:25,234
You take it.

500
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:31,634
It's the only way
you'll keep her with you.

501
00:35:32,804 --> 00:35:35,344
I'm just tired, Cory.

502
00:35:37,774 --> 00:35:40,374
You know, I just...

503
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:43,774
I'm so tired
of fighting this life.

504
00:35:45,584 --> 00:35:47,554
What you do now is for your boy.

505
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,744
Hmph.

506
00:35:50,454 --> 00:35:53,084
Drugs is his family now.

507
00:35:53,124 --> 00:35:55,224
He's gone, too.

508
00:35:55,254 --> 00:35:59,324
Lives right down the damn road,
but he's...

509
00:35:59,364 --> 00:36:01,604
he's gone.

510
00:36:01,624 --> 00:36:06,064
I expect they'll find out
he's involved in this somehow.

511
00:36:07,764 --> 00:36:10,834
He's staying
with the Littlefeather boys.

512
00:36:10,874 --> 00:36:13,544
Is that it?

513
00:36:13,574 --> 00:36:15,404
Yeah.

514
00:36:15,444 --> 00:36:18,244
You're driving this Fed around
so she don't

515
00:36:18,274 --> 00:36:20,244
get lost? Is that it?

516
00:36:20,284 --> 00:36:23,154
That's what they asked me to do.

517
00:36:24,214 --> 00:36:26,254
It's not what I'm doing.

518
00:36:29,394 --> 00:36:32,334
Then what are you doing?

519
00:36:33,494 --> 00:36:36,364
I'm a hunter, Martin.

520
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:39,534
What do you think I'm doing?

521
00:36:45,504 --> 00:36:48,644
If you find out who did this,

522
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:52,174
I don't care who it is.

523
00:36:52,214 --> 00:36:54,114
You understand me?

524
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,294
Right where they stand.

525
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:01,724
Then get off my porch
and go do it.

526
00:37:44,364 --> 00:37:45,894
Natalie's brother

527
00:37:45,934 --> 00:37:48,834
lives here with Stan
and Bart Littlefeather

528
00:37:48,864 --> 00:37:51,604
and a real piece of work
named Frank Walker.

529
00:37:54,604 --> 00:37:56,714
Hanson kid's bad,
but the others are just...

530
00:37:56,744 --> 00:37:58,744
stone evil, so watch yourself.

531
00:37:58,774 --> 00:38:01,884
Shouldn't we just maybe wait
for some backup?

532
00:38:01,914 --> 00:38:05,214
Well... this isn't the land
of backup, Jane.

533
00:38:05,254 --> 00:38:07,284
This is a land of
you're on your own.

534
00:38:26,944 --> 00:38:28,674
Listen to that shit.

535
00:38:34,944 --> 00:38:37,414
Yeah?

536
00:38:37,454 --> 00:38:39,554
Yeah, we're looking
for Chip Hanson. He around?

537
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:41,784
Not here, bro.

538
00:38:41,824 --> 00:38:43,754
Who are you?

539
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,624
Who the fuck are you?

540
00:38:47,664 --> 00:38:49,464
I'm the FBI.

541
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:50,864
Are you Sam?

542
00:38:50,894 --> 00:38:52,734
No.

543
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:54,464
You high right now, Sam?

544
00:38:54,504 --> 00:38:57,904
How many times
have I arrested you?

545
00:38:57,934 --> 00:39:01,244
Chief. What's up, bro?

546
00:39:01,274 --> 00:39:02,604
Where's your brother?

547
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:06,584
He's in prison
where you put him.

548
00:39:06,614 --> 00:39:08,244
What? No parole?

549
00:39:08,284 --> 00:39:11,684
Well, look at that...
the justice system at work.

550
00:39:11,714 --> 00:39:13,584
That reminds me.

551
00:39:13,624 --> 00:39:15,924
My P.O. told me
to give you something.

552
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:18,624
I... I got it... I got it
right here. Let's see...

553
00:39:18,654 --> 00:39:20,994
Wait. Let me see your hands.
Let me see...

554
00:39:28,364 --> 00:39:30,734
Cory! Watch the back!

555
00:41:37,794 --> 00:41:40,534
The other two's outside
with Cory. Let's go.

556
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:43,004
He's-he's still alive.
We need to call the EMS.

557
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:46,744
EMS is an hour away.
Just... just

558
00:41:46,774 --> 00:41:48,074
- leave him.
- Mm-mm.

559
00:41:48,104 --> 00:41:50,044
He's not dead, Ben.

560
00:41:58,054 --> 00:42:00,754
Like I said,

561
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:02,824
let's go.

562
00:42:15,234 --> 00:42:17,504
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

563
00:42:18,934 --> 00:42:20,904
The skinny one's
Natalie's brother.

564
00:42:20,944 --> 00:42:23,474
- Who's the other one?
- That...

565
00:42:23,514 --> 00:42:25,514
is a Frank Walker.

566
00:42:25,544 --> 00:42:27,514
Won't your daddy be proud?

567
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:30,044
My dad's in prison, asshole.

568
00:42:30,084 --> 00:42:31,854
I know. I put him there.

569
00:42:31,884 --> 00:42:34,154
Tell me what happened
to your sister, Chip.

570
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:36,024
What?

571
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:37,854
Don't play dumb.

572
00:42:37,894 --> 00:42:40,054
About what?
What happened to her?

573
00:42:42,734 --> 00:42:44,774
Huh?

574
00:42:44,794 --> 00:42:46,904
What'd that cracker do, huh?

575
00:42:46,934 --> 00:42:49,534
What... what cracker?

576
00:42:49,574 --> 00:42:51,984
Was she seeing a white guy?

577
00:42:52,004 --> 00:42:54,144
Do you know him?
Do you know who he is?

578
00:42:54,174 --> 00:42:56,744
Do you know his name, Chip?

579
00:42:58,614 --> 00:43:00,684
You just said "was."

580
00:43:00,714 --> 00:43:03,814
Why did you say "was"?

581
00:43:03,854 --> 00:43:06,984
Wh-Why did she say "was"?

582
00:43:07,024 --> 00:43:09,124
She just said "was"!

583
00:43:10,094 --> 00:43:12,064
Because I found her
raped and killed

584
00:43:12,094 --> 00:43:15,494
right over there, son.

585
00:43:15,534 --> 00:43:17,244
That's why.

586
00:43:22,104 --> 00:43:24,204
No.

587
00:43:27,744 --> 00:43:29,804
What?!

588
00:43:36,054 --> 00:43:38,264
What...?!

589
00:43:41,624 --> 00:43:43,794
You go. I'm gonna get Chip
over to Lander

590
00:43:43,824 --> 00:43:46,294
and see if he'll give me
the name of this boyfriend.

591
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:48,294
I'm telling you,
this is how we find him.

592
00:43:48,324 --> 00:43:50,734
No, we go to where
he works or where he lives.

593
00:43:50,764 --> 00:43:52,294
Yeah?

594
00:43:52,334 --> 00:43:54,034
All right, well,
where does he work?

595
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:56,034
Where does he live?

596
00:43:56,074 --> 00:43:59,314
You think this asshole's gonna
tell us anything? I don't.

597
00:43:59,334 --> 00:44:01,804
Look, I know
you're looking for clues,

598
00:44:01,844 --> 00:44:03,304
but you're missing
all the signs.

599
00:44:03,344 --> 00:44:05,174
Come here. Let me show you.

600
00:44:07,314 --> 00:44:09,014
See this here?

601
00:44:09,044 --> 00:44:11,954
- This is a sled track, right?
- Okay.

602
00:44:11,984 --> 00:44:14,054
Okay, you see out here
on the ridge?

603
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:15,754
Here.

604
00:44:15,794 --> 00:44:17,864
Use these.

605
00:44:17,894 --> 00:44:21,024
- Okay.
- You see at the end of the ridge here?

606
00:44:21,064 --> 00:44:22,894
Follow my hand.
Can you see my hand?

607
00:44:22,934 --> 00:44:26,774
- Yep.
- Okay, when I take it away, now look.

608
00:44:26,804 --> 00:44:29,004
- Do you see that?
- Uh-huh.

609
00:44:29,034 --> 00:44:30,974
- Can you see the shadow there?
- I think so.

610
00:44:31,004 --> 00:44:32,304
The snow's starting to cover it.

611
00:44:32,334 --> 00:44:34,080
Now look up at the base
of the mountain there...

612
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:35,674
you see it go
up the ridge there?

613
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,024
You'll see it
a lot easier there.

614
00:44:37,044 --> 00:44:38,914
You see those tracks go
up that mountain there?

615
00:44:38,944 --> 00:44:41,314
- Yeah, I see it.
- All right.

616
00:44:41,344 --> 00:44:44,754
Natalie's body was found
just past there. Right?

617
00:44:46,054 --> 00:44:48,754
And someone unloaded a sled
right here,

618
00:44:48,784 --> 00:44:51,094
drove all the way out there.

619
00:44:51,124 --> 00:44:54,794
There's no tracks coming back...
why is that?

620
00:44:54,824 --> 00:44:58,034
I'm telling you...
the answers are out there.

621
00:45:02,704 --> 00:45:05,804
Hey, look, um...

622
00:45:05,844 --> 00:45:08,684
I don't know how
to do this, okay?

623
00:45:08,704 --> 00:45:11,114
- I'm not a tracker.
- That's okay.

624
00:45:11,144 --> 00:45:13,174
That's all I do.

625
00:45:15,184 --> 00:45:16,684
Look...

626
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,284
- you asked me to help you, right?
- Yeah.

627
00:45:19,314 --> 00:45:21,624
We should go, while I still can.

628
00:45:22,384 --> 00:45:24,854
Okay.

629
00:45:44,314 --> 00:45:46,884
Why are we stopping?

630
00:45:46,914 --> 00:45:49,084
Well, we're above the storm now.

631
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:52,084
The trees are
too thick to drive.

632
00:45:52,114 --> 00:45:54,884
Got to walk from here.

633
00:45:54,924 --> 00:45:56,824
Come on.

634
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:03,394
- Put these on.
- Okay.

635
00:46:08,734 --> 00:46:11,074
Now what?

636
00:46:11,104 --> 00:46:13,744
We walk.

637
00:46:13,774 --> 00:46:15,904
Follow these sled tracks
heading south.

638
00:46:15,944 --> 00:46:17,244
- Ready?
- Yeah.

639
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,314
- All right, follow me.
- Mm. Okay.

640
00:46:47,374 --> 00:46:49,404
Oh, my God.

641
00:46:58,054 --> 00:47:00,154
Oh, my God.

642
00:47:20,044 --> 00:47:22,114
We were on foot
the last half mile of it,

643
00:47:22,144 --> 00:47:24,914
but we blazed a pretty good
trail in the snow, so...

644
00:47:24,944 --> 00:47:27,484
I could take the boys
back up there if you want.

645
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:30,114
Well, I'll talk
to the BIA supervisor.

646
00:47:30,154 --> 00:47:32,994
He just might want you
to do that.

647
00:47:33,024 --> 00:47:34,364
Security team
over at the rig's got cameras

648
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:35,824
around the perimeter.

649
00:47:35,854 --> 00:47:37,330
I'm gonna head up there
in the morning...

650
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,324
we might get lucky
and find something on tape.

651
00:47:39,354 --> 00:47:40,824
All right.

652
00:47:42,224 --> 00:47:45,094
Did... did the two we have
in custody say anything?

653
00:47:45,134 --> 00:47:47,864
They ain't
the talking kind, Jane.

654
00:47:47,904 --> 00:47:49,864
These kids,
they expect to go to prison.

655
00:47:49,904 --> 00:47:51,374
It's a rite of passage.

656
00:47:51,404 --> 00:47:53,804
Hell, I think they look forward
to it... you know, uh,

657
00:47:53,844 --> 00:47:57,074
three hots and a cot
and free cable.

658
00:47:57,114 --> 00:48:00,214
Anything's better than being
here, the way they see it.

659
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:02,784
Let's just test their DNA
against the semen

660
00:48:02,814 --> 00:48:04,514
and see what that tells us.

661
00:48:04,554 --> 00:48:06,514
- Can I talk to them?
- No, Cory.

662
00:48:06,554 --> 00:48:08,884
Anything they tell you
would be inadmissible in court.

663
00:48:08,924 --> 00:48:10,424
And then anything you'd tell us

664
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:13,194
would render every net result
inadmissible as well.

665
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:14,524
What if I didn't tell you?

666
00:48:14,564 --> 00:48:16,294
What if I just knew it?

667
00:48:19,964 --> 00:48:21,934
Yeah. Agent Banner.

668
00:48:21,964 --> 00:48:23,404
Yes, sir.

669
00:48:23,434 --> 00:48:24,534
Ben.

670
00:48:26,104 --> 00:48:29,004
I've known this kid
since he could walk.

671
00:48:29,044 --> 00:48:30,914
I gotta canvass the house.

672
00:48:30,944 --> 00:48:34,284
The, uh, back door only locks
from the inside.

673
00:48:55,934 --> 00:48:57,974
Look at you.

674
00:48:58,874 --> 00:49:01,444
Look at you.

675
00:49:01,474 --> 00:49:03,604
I didn't do shit.

676
00:49:06,044 --> 00:49:09,284
All you've been doing is shit
for the last few years, Chip.

677
00:49:10,554 --> 00:49:12,294
It's this place, man.

678
00:49:12,314 --> 00:49:14,584
Look what it takes from us.

679
00:49:14,624 --> 00:49:17,094
What it took from you.

680
00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:20,294
I'm not gonna stand here
and tell you that life's fair,

681
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:21,624
'cause it ain't.

682
00:49:21,664 --> 00:49:23,194
To either of us.

683
00:49:23,234 --> 00:49:25,444
But, you know,

684
00:49:25,464 --> 00:49:28,304
what do we do?

685
00:49:28,334 --> 00:49:30,134
This land, land,

686
00:49:30,174 --> 00:49:32,884
- this land is all we got left.
- What's this "we" shit?

687
00:49:32,904 --> 00:49:34,644
Only thing native about you
is your ex-wife,

688
00:49:34,674 --> 00:49:36,204
and the daughter
you couldn't protect.

689
00:49:36,244 --> 00:49:38,944
Maybe if you'd
played detective...

690
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:44,014
That's not something
you get to talk about.

691
00:49:44,054 --> 00:49:46,314
You hear me?

692
00:49:46,354 --> 00:49:48,654
Go over there.

693
00:49:54,394 --> 00:49:57,134
You're gonna lecture me
about protecting people

694
00:49:57,164 --> 00:50:00,034
while you deal the shit
that's killing them?

695
00:50:02,534 --> 00:50:05,034
Unlike most people,
you had every chance

696
00:50:05,074 --> 00:50:07,244
to get the hell out of here
if that's what you want.

697
00:50:07,274 --> 00:50:08,520
You had the army,
you had college...

698
00:50:08,544 --> 00:50:10,004
whatever, it was your choice.

699
00:50:10,044 --> 00:50:11,874
Look what you chose.

700
00:50:12,674 --> 00:50:14,514
Look what you chose.

701
00:50:15,514 --> 00:50:17,514
Goddamn you.

702
00:50:18,514 --> 00:50:21,324
I met him.

703
00:50:24,194 --> 00:50:26,124
Yeah?

704
00:50:26,164 --> 00:50:28,304
Yeah, the motherfucker
was almost as old as you.

705
00:50:28,324 --> 00:50:30,324
All right?

706
00:50:30,364 --> 00:50:33,564
I wanted to fight his ass, too.

707
00:50:33,604 --> 00:50:36,544
But Natalie wouldn't let me.

708
00:50:36,574 --> 00:50:40,044
Guess love really is blind, huh?

709
00:50:43,214 --> 00:50:46,284
He works security
on one of them drill sites.

710
00:50:48,714 --> 00:50:51,654
Does the boyfriend have a name?

711
00:50:51,684 --> 00:50:54,124
Matt. Matt something.

712
00:50:54,154 --> 00:50:55,284
I don't know.

713
00:50:55,324 --> 00:50:56,994
Who does?

714
00:50:57,024 --> 00:50:58,954
Sam knew.

715
00:50:58,994 --> 00:51:01,364
Why don't you ask him?

716
00:51:01,394 --> 00:51:04,294
I think you'll be talking
to Sam long before I do.

717
00:51:04,334 --> 00:51:08,464
You think this is
who I wanted to be?

718
00:51:09,464 --> 00:51:11,934
Man...

719
00:51:13,104 --> 00:51:15,204
I get so mad,

720
00:51:15,244 --> 00:51:17,574
I want to fight the whole world.

721
00:51:19,574 --> 00:51:23,244
You got any idea
what that feels like?

722
00:51:24,254 --> 00:51:26,054
I do.

723
00:51:28,224 --> 00:51:31,094
But I decided to fight
the feeling instead.

724
00:51:32,624 --> 00:51:35,364
'Cause I figured
the world would win.

725
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:42,534
What did I tell you?

726
00:51:42,564 --> 00:51:44,474
Did-did he say anything?

727
00:51:44,504 --> 00:51:46,734
No, fuck, I don't... I don't...
I don't want to know.

728
00:51:46,774 --> 00:51:50,174
- You're headed up to the rigs tomorrow, ain'tcha?
- Yeah.

729
00:51:50,214 --> 00:51:53,354
Natalie's boyfriend
worked there.

730
00:51:53,384 --> 00:51:54,754
What?

731
00:51:54,784 --> 00:51:57,554
No. Fuck, don't tell me.

732
00:51:57,584 --> 00:51:59,754
This thing's solving itself.

733
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:01,284
Cory.

734
00:52:01,324 --> 00:52:04,024
I want you at the rig
with us tomorrow.

735
00:52:05,624 --> 00:52:08,364
You don't catch wolves
looking where they might be,

736
00:52:08,394 --> 00:52:10,794
you look where they've been.

737
00:52:10,834 --> 00:52:13,274
They been right here.

738
00:52:29,084 --> 00:52:30,514
Hey.

739
00:52:30,554 --> 00:52:32,464
You okay?

740
00:52:34,724 --> 00:52:37,354
I been better.

741
00:52:38,354 --> 00:52:41,494
Brings it all back, doesn't it?

742
00:52:43,264 --> 00:52:45,564
Maybe.

743
00:52:45,594 --> 00:52:48,434
So, you and Ben
and this little FBI girl

744
00:52:48,464 --> 00:52:51,474
formed your own posse
to go solve it all, I hear.

745
00:52:53,674 --> 00:52:55,504
Just trying to help.

746
00:52:55,544 --> 00:52:59,074
You won't get the answers
you're looking for.

747
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:03,814
No matter what you find.

748
00:53:05,314 --> 00:53:07,684
This isn't about Emily.

749
00:53:14,594 --> 00:53:17,134
Good night, Cory.

750
00:53:47,864 --> 00:53:49,764
Matt Rayburn.

751
00:53:51,434 --> 00:53:53,464
Do you know him?

752
00:53:55,404 --> 00:53:56,734
That the guy we found
in the snow?

753
00:53:56,774 --> 00:53:58,644
Yeah. His fingerprints
are in the database.

754
00:53:58,674 --> 00:54:02,544
He's a security contractor
for one of the drill stations.

755
00:54:03,544 --> 00:54:05,444
All right.

756
00:54:07,584 --> 00:54:09,514
That it?

757
00:54:10,684 --> 00:54:12,314
- Am I fired now?
- No.

758
00:54:12,354 --> 00:54:14,184
- Come on, why don't you come inside.
- Okay.

759
00:54:14,224 --> 00:54:16,484
- We'll warm up.
- Yeah.

760
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:24,634
You, uh,
want something to drink?

761
00:54:24,664 --> 00:54:25,834
Sure.

762
00:54:25,864 --> 00:54:28,704
Got, uh... milk

763
00:54:28,734 --> 00:54:30,764
and coffee and well water.

764
00:54:30,804 --> 00:54:32,304
Water is good.

765
00:54:32,334 --> 00:54:33,804
Okay.

766
00:54:33,844 --> 00:54:35,384
All right, uh,

767
00:54:35,404 --> 00:54:37,444
just make yourself at home.

768
00:54:59,434 --> 00:55:00,394
Here you go.

769
00:55:00,434 --> 00:55:02,334
Thanks.

770
00:55:05,674 --> 00:55:07,644
That's, uh...

771
00:55:07,674 --> 00:55:09,604
that's my daughter, Emily.

772
00:55:09,644 --> 00:55:13,344
She passed three years ago.

773
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:17,484
I'm sorry.

774
00:55:19,454 --> 00:55:22,684
You want to know how, don't you?

775
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:27,664
I do, but...

776
00:55:27,694 --> 00:55:30,264
Makes two of us.

777
00:55:32,394 --> 00:55:35,334
I was, uh, working as, uh,
an outfitter in Pinedale,

778
00:55:35,364 --> 00:55:37,234
and there was a big snow.

779
00:55:37,274 --> 00:55:40,904
So I found myself
with a rare night off.

780
00:55:40,944 --> 00:55:43,584
So I go to a motel,
call the wife

781
00:55:43,614 --> 00:55:46,584
and say, "Why don't you come up
and stay for the night?"

782
00:55:46,614 --> 00:55:48,914
And when you got two... two kids

783
00:55:48,944 --> 00:55:51,784
and you're on the mountain
half the year, it's...

784
00:55:51,814 --> 00:55:54,724
you don't get much time
together.

785
00:55:54,754 --> 00:55:57,994
So we had Emily
look after Casey.

786
00:55:58,024 --> 00:56:00,394
He was five at the time.
She was 16.

787
00:56:00,424 --> 00:56:02,924
I guess word got out

788
00:56:02,964 --> 00:56:05,594
that we were out of town.

789
00:56:05,634 --> 00:56:07,604
So some school friends
came over.

790
00:56:07,634 --> 00:56:09,604
Then some more friends.

791
00:56:09,634 --> 00:56:12,874
Then, uh...

792
00:56:12,904 --> 00:56:15,644
and then some people came over
that weren't friends.

793
00:56:15,674 --> 00:56:20,644
So a little gathering turned
into quite the party, I guess.

794
00:56:20,684 --> 00:56:23,794
Then, uh...

795
00:56:23,814 --> 00:56:26,954
I don't know.

796
00:56:26,984 --> 00:56:30,424
You know,
there's a lot I don't know.

797
00:56:35,324 --> 00:56:37,764
Got that phone call
the next morning.

798
00:56:39,464 --> 00:56:41,504
From Natalie.

799
00:56:41,534 --> 00:56:44,904
Saying that Emily was missing.

800
00:56:46,504 --> 00:56:48,474
She was worried, naturally.

801
00:56:48,504 --> 00:56:52,544
They were best friends.

802
00:56:52,574 --> 00:56:56,614
You know, we tried to be
very careful with Emily.

803
00:56:57,654 --> 00:57:00,814
Tried to plan for everything.

804
00:57:06,024 --> 00:57:08,794
She was such a good girl.

805
00:57:10,964 --> 00:57:13,734
But we let our guard down.

806
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:15,934
Really, I tell you,

807
00:57:15,964 --> 00:57:20,474
you know,
you may have kids one day.

808
00:57:20,504 --> 00:57:23,474
You cannot blink.

809
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:27,074
Not once, not ever.

810
00:57:29,884 --> 00:57:34,454
There was a guy moving sheep
over by the Wind River.

811
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:36,954
He's the one who found her.

812
00:57:36,994 --> 00:57:40,634
Some 20 miles from our house.

813
00:57:40,664 --> 00:57:44,034
They don't know how she got
there or what happened.

814
00:57:44,064 --> 00:57:46,034
Autopsy couldn't tell us much,

815
00:57:46,064 --> 00:57:50,034
'cause the coyotes got at her
pretty good.

816
00:57:50,064 --> 00:57:53,634
You know, I'm-I'm sor...

817
00:57:53,674 --> 00:57:57,144
I'm sorry, it's not...

818
00:57:57,174 --> 00:57:59,544
I'm sorry.

819
00:57:59,574 --> 00:58:03,044
Could you point me, um...

820
00:58:03,084 --> 00:58:04,654
towards your...

821
00:58:04,684 --> 00:58:06,154
uh, the bathroom?

822
00:58:06,184 --> 00:58:08,024
Straight back there.

823
00:58:08,054 --> 00:58:10,084
Thanks.

824
00:58:36,044 --> 00:58:38,884
"There is a meadow
in my perfect world..."

825
00:58:38,914 --> 00:58:41,114
Emily wrote that.

826
00:58:44,624 --> 00:58:47,124
It's what got her accepted
into the summer writing program

827
00:58:47,164 --> 00:58:51,034
at Colorado State.

828
00:58:51,064 --> 00:58:53,964
Did she write it to you?

829
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:57,674
Mm.

830
00:58:57,704 --> 00:59:01,004
Doesn't matter who it's to.

831
00:59:01,044 --> 00:59:03,754
Just matters who it's from.

832
00:59:09,584 --> 00:59:12,084
Look, I'm sorry about, um,

833
00:59:12,114 --> 00:59:13,814
earlier tonight.

834
00:59:13,854 --> 00:59:15,684
I guess...

835
00:59:15,724 --> 00:59:18,894
I'm just trying to do
the right thing here.

836
00:59:18,924 --> 00:59:22,894
And I don't really know what
the Hanson boy told you, but...

837
00:59:22,924 --> 00:59:25,894
I don't want to stumble
into something like today

838
00:59:25,934 --> 00:59:27,904
if I can help it.

839
00:59:27,934 --> 00:59:31,704
So, you know,
if he said something that...

840
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:35,244
I should know,
I'd appreciate if you shared.

841
00:59:35,274 --> 00:59:37,574
Well, all he said was that.

842
00:59:37,614 --> 00:59:39,644
Natalie's boyfriend
was named Matt.

843
00:59:39,674 --> 00:59:42,944
And you've already figured out
who that is, so...

844
00:59:42,984 --> 00:59:46,854
You could've called
for that information, no?

845
00:59:46,884 --> 00:59:49,854
I wanted to know
why you're helping me.

846
00:59:49,884 --> 00:59:52,594
Now I do, so...

847
00:59:52,624 --> 00:59:54,924
Tomorrow...

848
00:59:54,964 --> 00:59:58,634
do you think we could not ride
the snowmobiles

849
00:59:58,664 --> 00:59:59,634
80 miles an hour?

850
00:59:59,664 --> 01:00:01,534
Yeah, sure.

851
01:00:01,564 --> 01:00:03,804
If you want to end up in a
ditch we could've jumped over,

852
01:00:03,834 --> 01:00:05,674
but...

853
01:00:05,704 --> 01:00:07,674
Great.

854
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:09,674
Okay.

855
01:00:09,704 --> 01:00:12,614
You win.

856
01:00:12,644 --> 01:00:14,014
Have a good night.

857
01:00:14,044 --> 01:00:15,514
All right.

858
01:00:15,544 --> 01:00:18,714
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

859
01:00:36,774 --> 01:00:38,744
You're shaking more than she is.

860
01:00:38,774 --> 01:00:41,704
It's cold enough to freeze
a well digger's ass out here.

861
01:00:41,744 --> 01:00:43,904
- Yeah. Below zero, I bet.
- Yeah, six below.

862
01:00:43,944 --> 01:00:45,814
It's a lot colder up there.

863
01:00:45,844 --> 01:00:48,244
Hey, bud.

864
01:00:48,284 --> 01:00:49,784
Hey. How are you doing?

865
01:00:49,814 --> 01:00:51,584
What are you doing here?

866
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:53,230
Those tracks that lead
from the Littlefeather house

867
01:00:53,254 --> 01:00:55,724
to the body, I'm gonna follow
'em, see where they go.

868
01:00:55,754 --> 01:00:57,254
- How about you?
- Yeah, well,

869
01:00:57,294 --> 01:00:58,634
Jane's the only one
with jurisdiction out there.

870
01:00:58,654 --> 01:01:01,024
Just wanted
a few extra badges along.

871
01:01:01,064 --> 01:01:02,904
You want to walk 'em
through this?

872
01:01:02,924 --> 01:01:04,834
Uh, sure, yeah. Um...

873
01:01:04,864 --> 01:01:07,094
the drill station has cameras
all along its perimeter,

874
01:01:07,134 --> 01:01:09,964
so we're hoping one of
the cameras caught something.

875
01:01:10,004 --> 01:01:13,804
And, uh, we'll also canvass
Matt Rayburn's trailer,

876
01:01:13,844 --> 01:01:15,820
and see if there's anything
that links him to the assault.

877
01:01:15,844 --> 01:01:17,844
Do you have a warrant?

878
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:19,214
I'm gonna ask real nice.

879
01:01:19,244 --> 01:01:22,584
Can't get there
from the Littlefeather house?

880
01:01:22,614 --> 01:01:25,114
Uh, it's a real tough sled ride
through two canyons,

881
01:01:25,154 --> 01:01:27,114
and I ain't looking
to dig you out,

882
01:01:27,154 --> 01:01:29,024
- so I wouldn't recommend it.
- We'll take

883
01:01:29,054 --> 01:01:30,584
the refinery road around.

884
01:01:30,624 --> 01:01:32,030
See, you got to drive 50 miles
to go five.

885
01:01:32,054 --> 01:01:34,024
- Yeah.
- Welcome to Wyoming.

886
01:01:34,064 --> 01:01:37,774
Didn't you people get the memo
that it's-it's spring?

887
01:01:38,964 --> 01:01:40,934
- Come on, guys.
- If you find anything,

888
01:01:40,964 --> 01:01:42,364
you call me on the radio...

889
01:01:42,404 --> 01:01:44,204
- Sure will.
- ...we'll come up to you.

890
01:04:40,844 --> 01:04:42,884
- Mornin'!
- Mornin'.

891
01:04:42,914 --> 01:04:44,884
Can I help you?

892
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:48,054
Yeah, does, uh,
Matt Rayburn work here?

893
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:50,284
Yeah. Do you know where he is?

894
01:04:50,324 --> 01:04:54,024
I was, uh, about to ask you
the same thing.

895
01:04:54,064 --> 01:04:57,104
No, he got in a fight with his
girlfriend a couple days ago.

896
01:04:57,134 --> 01:04:58,844
She took off.

897
01:04:58,864 --> 01:05:00,370
He took off after.
We haven't seen him since.

898
01:05:00,394 --> 01:05:02,364
- When was that?
- Three days ago.

899
01:05:02,404 --> 01:05:04,164
Hell, we-we didn't know
what to do.

900
01:05:04,204 --> 01:05:05,880
We've been waiting on corporate
ever since to tell us

901
01:05:05,904 --> 01:05:07,874
whether or not to fill out
his termination papers

902
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,220
- or call you guys.
- Everything okay?

903
01:05:09,244 --> 01:05:11,144
Yeah, yeah. Here about Matt.

904
01:05:11,174 --> 01:05:13,414
You find him? Is he okay?

905
01:05:13,444 --> 01:05:15,414
- What happened to you two?
- What's that?

906
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:17,954
You look a little torn up.

907
01:05:17,984 --> 01:05:19,954
Yeah, well, you hit

908
01:05:19,984 --> 01:05:21,160
one of these pine branches
doing 60,

909
01:05:21,184 --> 01:05:22,584
see what happens to you.

910
01:05:22,624 --> 01:05:24,200
Yeah, we run the
property line twice daily...

911
01:05:24,224 --> 01:05:26,354
comes with the territory.

912
01:05:26,394 --> 01:05:28,424
You should try using,
uh, face shields.

913
01:05:28,464 --> 01:05:30,294
I requested helmets.

914
01:05:30,324 --> 01:05:32,164
Our supervisor said,
"Snow's soft, ain't it?"

915
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:35,064
Corporate's in Texas.
What can I tell you?

916
01:05:35,104 --> 01:05:36,904
Does Matt bunk here
on the property?

917
01:05:36,934 --> 01:05:40,374
Yeah. Yeah, we all do.

918
01:05:41,944 --> 01:05:44,074
- Can we see his trailer?
- Yeah, sure.

919
01:05:44,114 --> 01:05:45,484
Come on, I'll walk you up.

920
01:05:45,514 --> 01:05:46,474
What's going on, boss?

921
01:05:46,514 --> 01:05:49,244
They're here about Matt.

922
01:06:12,534 --> 01:06:15,504
End of the line for you.

923
01:07:09,494 --> 01:07:11,564
So, did, uh...

924
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:13,094
did something happen to him?

925
01:07:13,134 --> 01:07:14,634
Do you know where he is?

926
01:07:14,664 --> 01:07:16,934
That's what we're trying
to find out.

927
01:07:16,974 --> 01:07:18,714
His girlfriend filed
a Missing Persons Report.

928
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:20,680
Well, how can that be?
I thought you guys found her

929
01:07:20,704 --> 01:07:22,180
in a snowdrift
right before the storm.

930
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:23,404
Excuse me?

931
01:07:23,444 --> 01:07:25,044
I heard her name
go out over the radio

932
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:26,720
- when you guys found her.
- I don't remember

933
01:07:26,744 --> 01:07:28,344
using her name.

934
01:07:30,314 --> 01:07:32,954
Well,
maybe you weren't listening.

935
01:07:34,524 --> 01:07:36,364
What the fuck are you doing?

936
01:07:36,384 --> 01:07:37,484
What?

937
01:07:39,194 --> 01:07:40,394
Why are you flanking me?

938
01:07:40,424 --> 01:07:42,470
- What are you talking about?
- What the fuck

939
01:07:42,494 --> 01:07:45,164
you think I'm talking about?
You got us on three sides...

940
01:07:45,194 --> 01:07:47,040
Get your hand off that weapon.
This is private property.

941
01:07:47,064 --> 01:07:48,980
Put the fucking gun down!

942
01:07:49,004 --> 01:07:49,964
- Hold it right there!
- Put the fucking gun

943
01:07:50,004 --> 01:07:50,934
- down right now!
- Hey!

944
01:07:50,974 --> 01:07:52,384
Put it down! Do it!

945
01:07:52,404 --> 01:07:54,304
- Drop to your knees right now!
- Do it!

946
01:07:54,344 --> 01:07:56,354
Turn away from me!
Drop to your knees right now!

947
01:07:56,374 --> 01:07:58,550
- Evan!
- Fuck you! This is a Department of Energy lease

948
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:00,074
on reservation land, asshole!

949
01:08:00,114 --> 01:08:02,114
- You're breaking the law by being here!
- Hey!

950
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:03,220
This is leased land
on a reservation, Deputy!

951
01:08:03,244 --> 01:08:05,684
- You got no authority!
- You think I don't know what

952
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:08,384
- you're doing?!
- Fucking do it, asshole! See what happens!

953
01:08:08,424 --> 01:08:10,024
Hoka hey, white boy, let's go.

954
01:08:10,054 --> 01:08:11,154
What are we doing?

955
01:08:11,194 --> 01:08:12,270
Deputy, you've got no authority!

956
01:08:12,294 --> 01:08:13,654
You're in violation
of federal law!

957
01:08:13,694 --> 01:08:15,764
- Lower your weapon!
- Fuck you!

958
01:08:15,794 --> 01:08:18,264
- You got us in a crossfire!
- Talk to me! What do I do?

959
01:08:18,294 --> 01:08:20,694
Hold your ground! County
sheriffs have no authority!

960
01:08:20,734 --> 01:08:23,334
- All right, everybody, just take it easy!
- FBI! Hey!

961
01:08:23,364 --> 01:08:28,174
FBI! This is federal land,
and I am the only authority!

962
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:29,574
Okay?!

963
01:08:29,604 --> 01:08:33,674
Right now,
all of you stand down!

964
01:08:33,714 --> 01:08:36,484
Okay? Everyone.

965
01:08:36,514 --> 01:08:39,614
We're all working
towards the same goal here,

966
01:08:39,654 --> 01:08:43,154
and I need you to back down

967
01:08:43,184 --> 01:08:46,494
and take your hands away
from your weapons.

968
01:08:46,524 --> 01:08:48,764
Look.

969
01:08:48,794 --> 01:08:52,194
Dillon, holster your weapon.

970
01:08:54,264 --> 01:08:56,104
Fucking decaf, man.

971
01:08:56,134 --> 01:08:57,664
Jesus fucking Christ.

972
01:08:57,704 --> 01:09:01,504
You keep these assholes
in check, lady.

973
01:09:01,544 --> 01:09:02,754
We're just doing
our fucking job here.

974
01:09:02,774 --> 01:09:04,144
Yeah, when we show up,

975
01:09:04,174 --> 01:09:06,114
- your job is over, asshole.
- Evan!

976
01:09:06,144 --> 01:09:07,514
Holster your weapon, now!

977
01:09:07,544 --> 01:09:09,514
All right. Every one of you
step to my left.

978
01:09:09,544 --> 01:09:12,284
- Let's go.
- Nobody behind me. Do you understand?

979
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:14,384
- You got it, asshole. Guys...
- Yeah.

980
01:09:14,424 --> 01:09:16,094
...step my way!

981
01:09:16,124 --> 01:09:18,594
Everybody take a big,
deep breath here, please.

982
01:09:18,624 --> 01:09:21,624
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Relax.
- Deputy,

983
01:09:21,664 --> 01:09:23,704
- holster your weapon.
- You didn't see it?

984
01:09:23,724 --> 01:09:26,094
Now, or you're under arrest.
Do you understand me?

985
01:09:27,704 --> 01:09:29,544
You didn't see it.

986
01:09:44,554 --> 01:09:47,094
Take us to Matt's trailer.

987
01:09:47,124 --> 01:09:49,164
Yes, ma'am.

988
01:10:08,144 --> 01:10:10,244
Ben, you copy?

989
01:10:13,474 --> 01:10:15,614
Ben, do you copy?

990
01:10:27,364 --> 01:10:29,274
Ben.

991
01:10:34,834 --> 01:10:37,864
This is it, right here.

992
01:10:37,904 --> 01:10:40,334
Does he bunk with anybody?

993
01:10:40,374 --> 01:10:43,404
Yeah. Me and Pete Mickens.

994
01:10:43,444 --> 01:10:44,804
Is Pete in there now?

995
01:10:44,844 --> 01:10:46,674
Yeah. He's sleeping.

996
01:10:46,714 --> 01:10:48,684
He's got the night shift.

997
01:11:22,614 --> 01:11:24,584
Can I help you?

998
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:28,584
Uh, yeah, I'm... I'm looking
for my knight in shining armor.

999
01:11:28,624 --> 01:11:30,954
I think this is his trailer.

1000
01:11:30,984 --> 01:11:32,554
Well, um...

1001
01:11:32,594 --> 01:11:34,824
Shit. I'm a little short
on armor, you know?

1002
01:11:34,864 --> 01:11:36,704
Um, I don't mind.

1003
01:11:36,724 --> 01:11:38,394
- You don't mind? Yeah?
- Uh-uh.

1004
01:11:38,434 --> 01:11:42,304
Do you have any idea
how good it is to see you?

1005
01:11:42,334 --> 01:11:44,904
Like, any idea? Man, oh, man.

1006
01:11:44,934 --> 01:11:47,534
How did you get here? I didn't
hear your carriage pull up.

1007
01:11:47,574 --> 01:11:49,244
Well, my, uh...

1008
01:11:49,274 --> 01:11:51,574
carriage wanted to catch
the 8:00 show in Lander...

1009
01:11:51,614 --> 01:11:53,754
...so she dropped me off at the turnout.

1010
01:11:53,774 --> 01:11:56,414
- What'd you do? You just walked in the snow, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

1011
01:11:56,444 --> 01:11:58,430
- Like Superwoman.
- Well, I think you're worth it.

1012
01:11:58,454 --> 01:12:00,314
- You think I'm worth it? Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1013
01:12:00,354 --> 01:12:02,224
Would you get your ass in here?

1014
01:12:02,254 --> 01:12:04,654
You're, like, baddest woman
on the planet, you know that?

1015
01:12:07,664 --> 01:12:10,204
Goddamn.

1016
01:12:11,834 --> 01:12:13,844
- How about New York?
- Oh!

1017
01:12:13,864 --> 01:12:15,564
You'd hate New York.

1018
01:12:15,604 --> 01:12:17,704
You'd hate it.
You go a whole month there,

1019
01:12:17,734 --> 01:12:20,874
your... your feet never touch
anything but cement.

1020
01:12:20,904 --> 01:12:22,704
Okay, how about Chicago?

1021
01:12:22,744 --> 01:12:25,414
Hmm, shit. Baby, it's the
same thing as New York.

1022
01:12:25,444 --> 01:12:27,914
- It's just colder, you know? More crime.
- Mmm.

1023
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:29,920
If you're into that kind of thing.

1024
01:12:29,944 --> 01:12:33,414
You think that's funny? Yeah?

1025
01:12:33,454 --> 01:12:35,824
All right,
how about Los Angeles, hmm?

1026
01:12:35,854 --> 01:12:37,354
Hey, listen to me.

1027
01:12:37,394 --> 01:12:38,770
Do never, ever say that word
around me again.

1028
01:12:38,794 --> 01:12:40,000
Oh. What? It's warm there.

1029
01:12:40,024 --> 01:12:41,724
Yeah, I'd rather be in Iraq.

1030
01:12:41,764 --> 01:12:43,334
Iraq's warm.

1031
01:12:43,364 --> 01:12:44,864
Mm.

1032
01:12:44,894 --> 01:12:46,894
And I'll tell you what.
I got one.

1033
01:12:46,934 --> 01:12:49,334
- Mm-hmm.
- I got one.

1034
01:12:49,364 --> 01:12:52,834
I was, uh...
I remember I was stationed

1035
01:12:52,874 --> 01:12:54,750
- up at this place called Point Mugu, right?
- Mm-hmm.

1036
01:12:54,774 --> 01:12:56,944
It's about an hour north
of L.A. It was Christmas.

1037
01:12:56,974 --> 01:12:58,514
I woke up, I'm all alone.

1038
01:12:58,544 --> 01:12:59,914
You know, I don't have anybody,

1039
01:12:59,944 --> 01:13:01,644
and what the Navy does
at Christmastime

1040
01:13:01,684 --> 01:13:03,694
is they have these dumb
little skits in the mess hall,

1041
01:13:03,714 --> 01:13:05,414
you know, for the guys
without families.

1042
01:13:05,454 --> 01:13:07,060
And I wasn't gonna stick around
for that bullshit,

1043
01:13:07,084 --> 01:13:08,684
so I just... I got in my truck,

1044
01:13:08,724 --> 01:13:10,484
and I hightailed it
out of there,

1045
01:13:10,524 --> 01:13:13,624
and I wound up in this little
mountain town called Ojai.

1046
01:13:13,654 --> 01:13:16,324
And I get there,
and it's like...

1047
01:13:16,364 --> 01:13:18,664
it's, like, fruit farms
and vineyards,

1048
01:13:18,694 --> 01:13:20,340
and there's this mountain
surrounding it, you know,

1049
01:13:20,364 --> 01:13:21,834
like, protecting the town.

1050
01:13:21,864 --> 01:13:23,534
And the people there are,
like...

1051
01:13:23,564 --> 01:13:25,874
- Everybody smiles at each other, you know?
- Yeah?

1052
01:13:25,904 --> 01:13:28,504
And they say hello,
and it's, like...

1053
01:13:28,544 --> 01:13:30,744
I remember thinking
that they were all, like...

1054
01:13:30,774 --> 01:13:33,344
I don't know. They had
these looks in their eyes.

1055
01:13:33,374 --> 01:13:35,054
Like they were in
on some sort of a secret,

1056
01:13:35,084 --> 01:13:37,394
like they had all
figured it out.

1057
01:13:37,414 --> 01:13:38,990
There's this mission,
this Spanish mission

1058
01:13:39,014 --> 01:13:40,484
right there
in the middle of town.

1059
01:13:40,514 --> 01:13:42,014
They're having Christmas Mass.

1060
01:13:42,054 --> 01:13:43,784
They're celebrating Christmas

1061
01:13:43,824 --> 01:13:46,024
in 70-degree weather,
you know, and I just went,

1062
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:48,024
and I picked me up an orange
off a tree,

1063
01:13:48,064 --> 01:13:50,104
and sat down on a bench
and listened

1064
01:13:50,124 --> 01:13:53,034
to that choir sing,
eating my orange, you know.

1065
01:13:53,064 --> 01:13:55,904
It was... I don't know.

1066
01:13:55,934 --> 01:13:58,474
It was the best Christmas
I ever had.

1067
01:14:01,134 --> 01:14:03,704
I want to live there.

1068
01:14:04,944 --> 01:14:07,344
Okay.

1069
01:14:07,384 --> 01:14:10,624
- Let's live in Ojai.
- Okay.

1070
01:14:10,644 --> 01:14:11,944
- Yeah?
- Mmm.

1071
01:14:17,554 --> 01:14:20,754
What time is it?

1072
01:14:20,794 --> 01:14:23,094
I thought they were staying
in town tonight.

1073
01:14:23,124 --> 01:14:24,824
I did, too.

1074
01:14:24,864 --> 01:14:27,364
Shit. I'm sorry, Nat.

1075
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:31,434
Just shut the, uh...

1076
01:14:35,874 --> 01:14:39,374
Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot!

1077
01:14:39,414 --> 01:14:41,944
- SHOT! SHOT! SHOT!
- Yo. What do we got? You got...

1078
01:14:41,984 --> 01:14:43,794
You got drinks?
You got... you got vodka?

1079
01:14:43,814 --> 01:14:45,984
- Whoa, hey.
- You got... What do you got?

1080
01:14:46,014 --> 01:14:48,000
Get me... get me a beer. Get me a beer.

1081
01:14:48,024 --> 01:14:49,534
- Fucking take one!
- You want... you want one?

1082
01:14:53,454 --> 01:14:55,124
- Man, you want one?
- Yo...

1083
01:14:55,164 --> 01:14:56,934
Smells like sex in here.

1084
01:15:01,534 --> 01:15:03,464
- What you two been doing?
- Well, well, well.

1085
01:15:03,504 --> 01:15:05,634
What do you got,
the fucking honeymoon suite?

1086
01:15:05,674 --> 01:15:08,074
What you two been doing, huh?

1087
01:15:08,104 --> 01:15:10,504
What have they been doing?

1088
01:15:10,544 --> 01:15:13,114
Hmm!

1089
01:15:13,144 --> 01:15:15,114
Well, hello there.

1090
01:15:15,144 --> 01:15:16,814
Hi, Pete.

1091
01:15:16,844 --> 01:15:20,484
Hello. You know, I'm...
just kind of wondering

1092
01:15:20,514 --> 01:15:22,130
what you got on under
them big sheets there.

1093
01:15:22,154 --> 01:15:24,484
Hey, Curt,
you mind getting him, man?

1094
01:15:24,524 --> 01:15:26,130
- Come on. Pete.
- I asked the lady a question.

1095
01:15:26,154 --> 01:15:28,100
- Pete.
- What does she got underneath them sheets?

1096
01:15:28,124 --> 01:15:30,894
It's a fluffy down coat, Pete.
It's not very sexy.

1097
01:15:30,924 --> 01:15:32,534
Well, fluffy sounds good to me.

1098
01:15:32,564 --> 01:15:34,710
- Hey, Curt, you gonna get him or not, man?
- Matty.

1099
01:15:34,734 --> 01:15:36,064
Wait a second.
Are you naked, too?

1100
01:15:36,104 --> 01:15:37,634
Are you... are you naked, too?

1101
01:15:37,674 --> 01:15:39,714
- What have you two been doing?!
- Come on!

1102
01:15:39,734 --> 01:15:41,580
- Are you naked?
- Hey, Curt, you mind getting him out of my

1103
01:15:41,604 --> 01:15:43,050
- room, please? -Come on, Pete. Let's go!
- Are you naked, too?

1104
01:15:43,074 --> 01:15:45,744
- What have you two been doing?
- Hey, Curt,

1105
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:47,560
- could you get him, man?
- Huh? -Pete, come on!

1106
01:15:47,584 --> 01:15:48,824
- I'll tell you what. I just want one little peek.
- Come on!

1107
01:15:48,844 --> 01:15:49,920
I just want one little... just
a little... just a little peek.

1108
01:15:49,944 --> 01:15:51,160
Hey, Curt, why don't you
come in here and and get him

1109
01:15:51,184 --> 01:15:53,914
out of here? I don't understand
why you don't do that, man.

1110
01:15:53,954 --> 01:15:55,954
- Come on!
- Just a little pek. Just a little peek.

1111
01:15:55,984 --> 01:15:58,024
- Hey!
- What the fuck is your problem?

1112
01:15:58,054 --> 01:15:59,594
- Hey!
- Oh, ho!

1113
01:15:59,624 --> 01:16:02,464
Bros, whoa, whoa, whoa,
he turned all serious

1114
01:16:02,494 --> 01:16:03,800
all of a sudden.
Why are you doing that?

1115
01:16:03,824 --> 01:16:06,764
- Come on. Pete.
- Huh? Now don't you be

1116
01:16:06,794 --> 01:16:08,210
bullshitting me, girl. You've
been showing your little ass

1117
01:16:08,234 --> 01:16:10,204
like a flag around here.

1118
01:16:10,234 --> 01:16:12,574
And I've been seeing it,
and all I want is a little...

1119
01:16:12,604 --> 01:16:14,550
All I want is a little peek.

1120
01:16:14,574 --> 01:16:15,944
What are you gonna do, big boy?

1121
01:16:17,674 --> 01:16:19,114
What are you gonna do? Come on.

1122
01:16:19,144 --> 01:16:20,890
- What are you gonna do, big boy?
- Pete. Sit down, Pete.

1123
01:16:20,914 --> 01:16:23,714
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1124
01:16:23,744 --> 01:16:25,954
- Hey.
- The fuck's that about?

1125
01:16:25,984 --> 01:16:27,530
Fucking chill.

1126
01:16:27,554 --> 01:16:29,000
- Oh, yeah, I see that.
- Pete, have a seat.

1127
01:16:29,024 --> 01:16:30,260
- He don't want to share.
- I don't understand.

1128
01:16:30,284 --> 01:16:31,924
Man doesn't want to be friends.

1129
01:16:31,954 --> 01:16:33,854
You know what? You know what?
We ain't friends.

1130
01:16:33,894 --> 01:16:35,724
Friends share.

1131
01:16:35,764 --> 01:16:37,894
- Hey!
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1132
01:16:37,934 --> 01:16:39,874
- Aah!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1133
01:16:39,894 --> 01:16:42,504
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What the fuck!

1134
01:16:42,534 --> 01:16:44,904
Being such a fucking pussy
over this prairie nigger.

1135
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:45,950
Hey!

1136
01:16:45,974 --> 01:16:47,104
- Stop!
- Hey, hey!

1137
01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:52,144
Pete!

1138
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:54,044
Hey! Hey!

1139
01:16:55,784 --> 01:16:59,014
Matty!

1140
01:17:01,314 --> 01:17:02,884
Get him off him!

1141
01:17:02,924 --> 01:17:04,230
- Get the fuck off!
- Matty, get the fuck off!

1142
01:17:04,254 --> 01:17:05,794
Don't fucking turn...

1143
01:17:07,724 --> 01:17:10,224
Hey, guys.

1144
01:17:10,264 --> 01:17:11,964
Hey. Come on.

1145
01:17:13,864 --> 01:17:16,164
Jesus. Aah!

1146
01:17:25,714 --> 01:17:27,014
Get the fuck off!

1147
01:17:28,084 --> 01:17:30,294
Hold him!

1148
01:17:39,024 --> 01:17:41,154
He hit my head good.

1149
01:18:01,984 --> 01:18:04,824
You ain't too proud now, are you, bitch?

1150
01:18:06,784 --> 01:18:08,660
- Huh?
- Next one's my turn, you fucking bitch.

1151
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:11,824
Dude.

1152
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:13,254
Oh, God!

1153
01:18:20,164 --> 01:18:21,740
Get his arm.

1154
01:18:21,764 --> 01:18:23,240
Grab his arm.
Pull... pull him off.

1155
01:18:23,264 --> 01:18:26,234
Pull. Get his arm.

1156
01:18:28,344 --> 01:18:32,214
- Arm.
- Grab his arm!

1157
01:18:41,354 --> 01:18:43,924
FBI! Open up!

1158
01:18:55,804 --> 01:18:57,334
Are you sure someone's in there?

1159
01:18:57,364 --> 01:19:00,334
Hey, Pete, it's Curtis.

1160
01:19:00,374 --> 01:19:03,004
Ben, you copy?

1161
01:19:03,044 --> 01:19:05,774
FBI is standing in front
of the door. Open up!

1162
01:19:06,914 --> 01:19:09,014
Jane!

1163
01:19:09,044 --> 01:19:10,384
Get away from the door!

1164
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:24,194
Aah!

1165
01:20:06,374 --> 01:20:09,404
Fuck you. Let's go.

1166
01:20:17,444 --> 01:20:20,484
Pete, you okay?

1167
01:20:20,514 --> 01:20:22,084
- I'm hit!
- Who isn't?

1168
01:20:22,124 --> 01:20:24,194
- Pete, you good?
- We're good!

1169
01:20:24,224 --> 01:20:25,724
How many we got down?

1170
01:20:25,754 --> 01:20:27,194
Two that won't get up.

1171
01:20:27,224 --> 01:20:29,464
No. I'm getting up.

1172
01:20:35,334 --> 01:20:39,374
Goddamn it,
the women out here are spunky.

1173
01:20:47,074 --> 01:20:50,284
Anyone see where that came from?

1174
01:20:53,884 --> 01:20:55,984
- Can you stand?
- I don't know.

1175
01:20:56,024 --> 01:20:59,124
Well, you better figure it out
'cause we're not done yet.

1176
01:21:04,224 --> 01:21:06,094
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1177
01:21:06,134 --> 01:21:08,064
Curtis?

1178
01:21:08,104 --> 01:21:10,174
Mike!

1179
01:21:10,204 --> 01:21:12,034
Hey, Curtis!

1180
01:21:12,074 --> 01:21:14,814
Behind trailer three!

1181
01:21:21,314 --> 01:21:23,844
Aah!

1182
01:21:59,984 --> 01:22:03,324
- You okay?
- Mm. Mm.

1183
01:22:03,354 --> 01:22:04,984
Let's get you inside.

1184
01:22:16,564 --> 01:22:18,064
Mind if I have a look?

1185
01:22:18,104 --> 01:22:21,134
I...

1186
01:22:21,174 --> 01:22:22,874
It's...

1187
01:22:22,904 --> 01:22:25,404
I see a couple rounds
went through here.

1188
01:22:25,444 --> 01:22:27,244
It's just pieces.
You should be okay.

1189
01:22:27,274 --> 01:22:29,184
There. Let's see.

1190
01:22:29,214 --> 01:22:31,444
Let's see here.

1191
01:22:33,914 --> 01:22:35,254
Okay.

1192
01:22:47,564 --> 01:22:49,110
Yeah, hold that. Press it tight.

1193
01:22:49,134 --> 01:22:50,434
- Uh, yeah.
- Okay.

1194
01:22:50,464 --> 01:22:52,404
Okay.

1195
01:22:58,144 --> 01:22:59,874
Okay.

1196
01:23:05,484 --> 01:23:07,354
Give...

1197
01:23:07,384 --> 01:23:09,884
Give me your radio.

1198
01:23:09,924 --> 01:23:11,584
My best chance out of here...

1199
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:15,194
...is a helicopter.

1200
01:23:15,224 --> 01:23:17,194
You don't have one of those,
do you?

1201
01:23:17,224 --> 01:23:20,894
- Nope.
- Hey.

1202
01:23:22,064 --> 01:23:25,404
Hey, give me your radio.

1203
01:23:25,434 --> 01:23:27,604
Go get him.

1204
01:23:27,634 --> 01:23:31,044
I won't bring him back.

1205
01:23:31,074 --> 01:23:33,044
You have to know that.

1206
01:23:33,074 --> 01:23:35,614
I do.

1207
01:23:35,644 --> 01:23:38,344
Go get him.

1208
01:23:46,194 --> 01:23:47,494
Whoa.

1209
01:24:54,724 --> 01:24:57,364
Come on! Come on!

1210
01:25:19,584 --> 01:25:21,084
You know where you are?

1211
01:25:21,114 --> 01:25:22,514
No.

1212
01:25:22,554 --> 01:25:24,324
It's Gannett Peak.

1213
01:25:25,754 --> 01:25:27,494
Highest mountain in Wyoming.

1214
01:25:27,524 --> 01:25:30,494
And on the hottest day
in August,

1215
01:25:30,524 --> 01:25:33,034
shovel a foot of snow.

1216
01:25:33,064 --> 01:25:35,264
Today...

1217
01:25:35,304 --> 01:25:37,114
too cold to snow.

1218
01:25:37,134 --> 01:25:39,034
Look, man, let's just...

1219
01:25:39,074 --> 01:25:40,510
let's just talk
for a minute, all right?

1220
01:25:40,534 --> 01:25:43,374
Let's just... talk. Please.

1221
01:25:43,404 --> 01:25:44,744
Sure.

1222
01:25:57,784 --> 01:26:01,124
What the fuck?!
Where are my boots?!

1223
01:26:01,154 --> 01:26:03,294
- Where are my boots?!
- You know, I got all

1224
01:26:03,324 --> 01:26:04,764
the time in the world here.

1225
01:26:04,794 --> 01:26:07,094
Can't say the same for you.

1226
01:26:07,134 --> 01:26:10,134
So we gonna talk,
or you gonna keep whining?

1227
01:26:11,864 --> 01:26:13,574
Look, I'm...

1228
01:26:13,604 --> 01:26:16,204
I have made mistakes, okay?

1229
01:26:16,244 --> 01:26:18,844
So what'd you do?

1230
01:26:18,874 --> 01:26:22,314
Um...

1231
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:24,644
Hey, look, I'm...
I'm not the law here.

1232
01:26:24,684 --> 01:26:27,654
I'm just a guy
sitting in front of you.

1233
01:26:27,684 --> 01:26:30,224
So you can tell me the truth.

1234
01:26:30,254 --> 01:26:32,684
If you tell me the truth,
I'll give you a chance.

1235
01:26:32,724 --> 01:26:34,194
Ah, you just listen to me!

1236
01:26:34,224 --> 01:26:35,594
You know what it's like

1237
01:26:35,624 --> 01:26:38,194
out here in this frozen hell?

1238
01:26:39,734 --> 01:26:42,694
There's no nothing to do.
No nothing.

1239
01:26:42,734 --> 01:26:46,374
Ain't no women, no fun!

1240
01:26:46,404 --> 01:26:48,574
Just this fucking...
this fucking snow

1241
01:26:48,604 --> 01:26:50,444
and the fucking silence.

1242
01:26:50,474 --> 01:26:52,344
That's all!

1243
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:55,314
My family's people
were forced here,

1244
01:26:55,344 --> 01:26:57,484
stuck here for a century.

1245
01:26:57,514 --> 01:26:59,754
That snow and silence...

1246
01:26:59,784 --> 01:27:02,314
it's the only thing that hasn't
been taken from them.

1247
01:27:04,854 --> 01:27:06,824
- So what'd you take?
- I don't know.

1248
01:27:06,854 --> 01:27:08,754
I don't know.
I don't know what you...

1249
01:27:08,794 --> 01:27:10,424
I don't know what you mean.

1250
01:27:10,464 --> 01:27:12,594
You take something, too?

1251
01:27:12,634 --> 01:27:14,674
No.

1252
01:27:15,804 --> 01:27:18,574
- Nothing.
- Ah.

1253
01:27:26,914 --> 01:27:28,714
Hey.

1254
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:30,684
I need you to be honest with me.

1255
01:27:30,714 --> 01:27:32,684
Right?

1256
01:27:33,854 --> 01:27:36,424
You get drunk?

1257
01:27:36,454 --> 01:27:38,354
Get lonely?

1258
01:27:38,394 --> 01:27:40,864
Then what'd you get?

1259
01:27:40,894 --> 01:27:44,394
If you did it,
just be a man and say it.

1260
01:27:44,424 --> 01:27:46,364
Say, "I raped her."

1261
01:27:46,394 --> 01:27:48,534
I raped her.

1262
01:27:48,564 --> 01:27:50,834
I raped her! Yeah!

1263
01:28:01,544 --> 01:28:03,614
And the boyfriend?

1264
01:28:03,644 --> 01:28:05,444
What, did he get in your way?

1265
01:28:05,484 --> 01:28:06,884
Did you beat him to death?

1266
01:28:06,914 --> 01:28:09,854
Look, a nod's
not gonna cut it, okay?

1267
01:28:09,884 --> 01:28:11,654
- Need you to say it.
- We beat him.

1268
01:28:11,684 --> 01:28:14,224
We made him dead.

1269
01:28:16,224 --> 01:28:18,264
Okay.

1270
01:28:26,274 --> 01:28:28,904
Please don't.

1271
01:28:30,244 --> 01:28:32,304
I'm gonna cut you loose.

1272
01:28:34,244 --> 01:28:35,874
It's okay.

1273
01:28:37,584 --> 01:28:39,954
Free to go.

1274
01:28:42,754 --> 01:28:44,584
Where?! Where am I gonna go?!

1275
01:28:44,624 --> 01:28:46,294
I'm a man of my word.

1276
01:28:46,324 --> 01:28:49,924
You told the truth.

1277
01:28:49,964 --> 01:28:52,624
I'm gonna give you a chance.

1278
01:28:52,664 --> 01:28:54,834
I'm gonna give you
the same chance

1279
01:28:54,864 --> 01:28:56,704
that she got.

1280
01:28:56,734 --> 01:28:58,404
What... what chance did she get?

1281
01:28:58,434 --> 01:29:00,374
What... what chance did she get?

1282
01:29:00,404 --> 01:29:03,304
If you can make it
to that highway,

1283
01:29:03,344 --> 01:29:04,974
you're a free man.

1284
01:29:05,004 --> 01:29:07,344
Where-Where's...
where-where is the highway?

1285
01:29:07,374 --> 01:29:09,244
You know how far
that drill camp was

1286
01:29:09,284 --> 01:29:10,560
from where
I found Natalie's body?

1287
01:29:10,584 --> 01:29:11,844
No.

1288
01:29:11,884 --> 01:29:14,254
Six miles. Barefoot.

1289
01:29:16,454 --> 01:29:18,824
That's a warrior.

1290
01:29:20,894 --> 01:29:22,524
That's a warrior.

1291
01:29:22,564 --> 01:29:25,734
You? You may make 600 feet,
but...

1292
01:29:25,764 --> 01:29:27,634
- Uh...
- ...you better get going.

1293
01:29:27,664 --> 01:29:30,664
But...

1294
01:29:30,704 --> 01:29:34,474
I don't understand.
I don't understand.

1295
01:29:34,504 --> 01:29:36,504
What do you want me to do?!

1296
01:29:36,544 --> 01:29:39,314
I want you to run.

1297
01:31:10,734 --> 01:31:12,764
How you feeling?

1298
01:31:12,804 --> 01:31:14,834
I feel okay.

1299
01:31:16,944 --> 01:31:18,944
I got you something.

1300
01:31:18,974 --> 01:31:23,074
Thought maybe it'd give you
a little taste of home.

1301
01:31:27,614 --> 01:31:29,624
Little crocodile.

1302
01:31:29,654 --> 01:31:32,024
Please don't make me laugh.

1303
01:31:33,654 --> 01:31:36,494
It's an alligator.

1304
01:31:36,524 --> 01:31:39,794
He'll protect you, better than
that bulletproof vest, right?

1305
01:31:43,704 --> 01:31:46,734
I shouldn't joke about that...
it saved your life.

1306
01:31:47,904 --> 01:31:50,544
You saved my life.

1307
01:31:53,844 --> 01:31:55,374
Well...

1308
01:32:01,054 --> 01:32:04,024
Jane, you're a tough woman.

1309
01:32:04,054 --> 01:32:06,494
You saved your own life.

1310
01:32:07,524 --> 01:32:09,124
We should both be honest.

1311
01:32:09,164 --> 01:32:10,434
I just...

1312
01:32:11,724 --> 01:32:14,134
I got lucky.

1313
01:32:14,164 --> 01:32:18,034
Well, you know,
luck don't live out here.

1314
01:32:18,064 --> 01:32:20,474
Luck lives in the city.

1315
01:32:23,074 --> 01:32:25,574
Don't live out here.

1316
01:32:26,944 --> 01:32:28,914
You know,
that's whether you get,

1317
01:32:28,944 --> 01:32:31,544
you know, hit by a bus or not.

1318
01:32:31,584 --> 01:32:34,014
Whether your...
bank is robbed or not,

1319
01:32:34,054 --> 01:32:36,014
or whether someone's...
on their damn cell phone

1320
01:32:36,054 --> 01:32:38,224
when they come up
to a crosswalk... that's luck.

1321
01:32:38,254 --> 01:32:39,894
That's winning or losing.

1322
01:32:39,924 --> 01:32:43,024
Out here, you survive
or you surrender. Period.

1323
01:32:43,064 --> 01:32:46,974
That's determined by your
strength and by your spirit.

1324
01:32:48,234 --> 01:32:50,934
Wolves don't kill unlucky deer.

1325
01:32:50,964 --> 01:32:53,004
They kill the weak ones.

1326
01:32:53,034 --> 01:32:55,874
You fought for your life, Jane.

1327
01:32:58,174 --> 01:33:00,974
Now you get to walk away
with it.

1328
01:33:05,184 --> 01:33:07,454
You get to go home.

1329
01:33:16,024 --> 01:33:18,594
I know what you're doing.

1330
01:33:20,264 --> 01:33:23,034
I'm gonna read to you
from a magazine.

1331
01:33:25,604 --> 01:33:28,774
"Ten Signs That He's Into You."

1332
01:33:30,304 --> 01:33:32,674
Things that
I really want to know.

1333
01:33:32,714 --> 01:33:35,924
"He looks you in the eye
when he speaks."

1334
01:33:37,844 --> 01:33:39,614
Ain't you supposed to do...

1335
01:33:42,624 --> 01:33:46,034
She ran six miles in the snow.

1336
01:33:48,254 --> 01:33:50,124
Yes, she did.

1337
01:34:06,844 --> 01:34:08,574
Hello?

1338
01:34:11,584 --> 01:34:13,044
Martin?

1339
01:34:25,894 --> 01:34:28,134
Martin?

1340
01:34:30,804 --> 01:34:32,134
Hey.

1341
01:34:41,674 --> 01:34:44,014
Martin?

1342
01:35:14,974 --> 01:35:16,844
Annie?

1343
01:37:03,154 --> 01:37:04,884
Hey.

1344
01:37:10,394 --> 01:37:13,294
What's with the paint?

1345
01:37:14,264 --> 01:37:16,764
It's my death face.

1346
01:37:18,234 --> 01:37:20,134
Is that right?

1347
01:37:23,204 --> 01:37:26,344
And how would you know
what that is?

1348
01:37:26,374 --> 01:37:27,944
I don't.

1349
01:37:29,444 --> 01:37:31,144
Just made it up.

1350
01:37:31,184 --> 01:37:34,054
'Cause there's no one left
to teach me.

1351
01:37:42,524 --> 01:37:44,924
I was ready to quit.

1352
01:37:47,194 --> 01:37:50,004
Then the phone rang.

1353
01:37:50,034 --> 01:37:52,434
Which is never good.

1354
01:37:54,204 --> 01:37:56,434
But today it was.

1355
01:37:59,344 --> 01:38:02,814
First time Chip's called me
in over a year.

1356
01:38:05,984 --> 01:38:08,384
Where is he?

1357
01:38:08,414 --> 01:38:10,484
The station.

1358
01:38:12,894 --> 01:38:15,264
I was gonna go pick him up.

1359
01:38:15,294 --> 01:38:18,224
As soon as I washed
this shit off my face.

1360
01:38:21,334 --> 01:38:23,764
Heard about what happened.

1361
01:38:26,274 --> 01:38:29,114
Heard there's one still missing.

1362
01:38:29,144 --> 01:38:30,784
No.

1363
01:38:32,914 --> 01:38:35,224
No one's missing.

1364
01:38:39,084 --> 01:38:41,284
How'd he go out?

1365
01:38:45,284 --> 01:38:47,324
With a whimper.

1366
01:38:53,164 --> 01:38:56,864
You better go easy on Chip.

1367
01:38:56,904 --> 01:39:00,004
Suffering's hard on young men;
They don't have our practice.

1368
01:39:04,174 --> 01:39:06,374
I should go get him.

1369
01:39:07,344 --> 01:39:09,044
Yeah, but I...

1370
01:39:09,084 --> 01:39:11,294
just need to sit here...

1371
01:39:13,354 --> 01:39:15,564
...and miss her for a minute.

1372
01:39:20,354 --> 01:39:22,524
You got time to sit with me?

1373
01:39:24,494 --> 01:39:27,064
Oh, I ain't goin' nowhere.
