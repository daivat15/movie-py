1
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,746
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST

2
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,335
WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY
JEAN COCTEAU

3
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,430
FROM A STORY BY
MADAME LEPRINCE DE BEAUMONT

4
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,148
- Action.
- Rolling.

5
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,771
<i>Beauty and the Beast,</i>
take one.

6
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,652
Cut. Just a minute.

7
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:44,238
CHILDREN BELIEVE WHAT WE TELL THEM.
THEY HAVE COMPLETE FAITH IN US.

8
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:49,042
THEY BELIEVE THAT A ROSE PLUCKED
FROM A GARDEN

9
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:53,622
CAN PLUNGE A FAMILY INTO CONFLICT.

10
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:58,255
THEY BELIEVE THAT THE HANDS
OF A HUMAN BEAST

11
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:02,840
WILL SMOKE WHEN HE SLAYS A VICTIM

12
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:07,177
AND THAT THIS WILL CAUSE
THE BEAST SHAME

13
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,435
WHEN A YOUNG MAIDEN
TAKES UP RESIDENCE IN HIS HOME.

14
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:15,064
THEY BELIEVE A THOUSAND OTHER
SIMPLE THINGS.

15
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:19,318
I ASK OF YOU A LITTLE
OF THIS CHILDLIKE SIMPLICITY

16
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:23,869
AND, TO BRING US LUCK,

17
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:28,449
LET ME SPEAK FOUR MAGIC WORDS,
CHILDHOOD'S "OPEN SESAME":

18
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,579
ONE UPON A TIME...

19
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,678
That girl.

20
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,801
You know how she is.
She can't do a thing.

21
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,887
No good!

22
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,479
Cheater!
Your foot's not on the line.

23
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,521
My dress!

24
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,784
- What's the matter?
- They shot an arrow into the room.

25
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,868
You brutes!
You could have blinded us!

26
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,593
- Is Belle all right?
- Always Belle.

27
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,010
The hell with her!

28
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,965
You nearly killed Cabriole.

29
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,323
There they are.

30
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,872
Belle, scrub the floor.
We're going to be late for the duchess.

31
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:01,045
Murderers!
- My sisters are shrews.

32
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,593
Drinking, chasing girls and cheating
at cards - it's all they care about.

33
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:08,468
When you're poor, you stay home
and wash clothes and polish the cutlery.

34
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,557
These witches act like princesses

35
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,515
and never even realise
everyone's laughing in their face.

36
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,522
- Answer him.
- I won't give him the satisfaction.

37
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,528
What beautiful creatures!

38
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,110
Let's hurry
or we'll miss the concert.

39
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,783
So enchanting! So divine!

40
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,030
Simpletons!

41
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,578
Footmen!

42
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,430
Incredible!

43
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,552
Do we pay you to sleep?

44
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,316
I've never seen anything like it!

45
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,272
These chairs!

46
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,569
These chairs are filthy!

47
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,570
Footmen!

48
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,204
Hurry up!

49
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,460
Come on, we're leaving!

50
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,838
Not under the ladder!

51
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,595
Drunkards,
you're asleep on your feet!

52
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,673
That drunkard doesn't
even know his place.

53
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,922
Good-for-nothing!

54
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,426
They've been drinking!

55
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,888
Come on, footmen!

56
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:34,031
May the devil himself
splatter you with dung.

57
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,168
Belle,

58
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,796
you weren't made to be a servant.

59
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:55,097
Even the floor longs
to be your mirror!

60
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:02,264
You mustn't go on slaving
day and night for your sisters.

61
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,771
If our father's ships
hadn't been lost in the storm,

62
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,352
then perhaps I could
enjoy myself like them.

63
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,529
But we're ruined, Avenant,
and I must work.

64
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,948
Why don't your sisters work?

65
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,864
My sisters are too beautiful.

66
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,786
Their hands are too white.

67
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,789
Belle,

68
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,662
you are the most beautiful of all!

69
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,249
Look at your hands.

70
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,046
Avenant, let go of my hand.

71
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,500
Please go.
I must finish my work.

72
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,673
I love you.

73
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:36,968
Marry me.

74
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,343
No, Avenant.
You mustn't speak of that again.

75
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,178
It's no use.

76
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,189
You don't like me.

77
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,313
It's not that, Avenant.

78
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,814
Well, then?

79
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,738
I must remain a maid
and stay with Father.

80
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,367
I'll carry you away
from this stupid life!

81
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,869
Let me go!

82
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,656
Get your hands off her!
Do you want a black eye?

83
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,163
It's all right, Ludovic.
He was asking me to marry him.

84
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,460
- What did you say?
- Your sister doesn't want me.

85
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,120
Well done, Belle.

86
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,415
I'm a scoundrel, and proud of it,

87
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,091
but I won't stand
to see you marry one.

88
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,464
Consider yourself warned.

89
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,515
Now clear off, you goon!

90
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,435
Avenant, you're mad!

91
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,691
Come in, gentlemen.

92
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:36,274
Make yourselves at home
while I tell everyone the great news.

93
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,083
My father!

94
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,750
He mustn't know.

95
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:55,168
My daughters are out
being pampered by high society.

96
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,425
But I can't wait for them.
I'm itching to break the news.

97
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,678
Come here, Belle.

98
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,184
Come, Ludovic.

99
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,566
You're welcome too, Avenant.

100
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,403
These gentlemen will overlook
your mischief,

101
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,951
just as the prosecutor here
has done me the great favour

102
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,496
of suspending all proceedings
begun against me.

103
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,198
We're going to be rich!

104
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,249
One of my ships has arrived
with its cargo.

105
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,328
- Avenant knew it!
- Ludovic!

106
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,080
That's why he asked
Belle to marry him.

107
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,757
He asked me before
while we were still poor.

108
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:39,133
- Are you going to leave me?
- No, Father, I'll never leave you.

109
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,224
They said the duchess
wasn't receiving guests,

110
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,346
but we could hear laughter
and music in the court.

111
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,395
Congratulations, Father! We've just
reaped the fruits of your foolishness.

112
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,972
You should be proud!

113
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,479
Invite one and all to drink
while your daughters are insulted

114
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,356
and doors slam in their face!

115
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,062
- My darlings!
- That duchess is a smart woman.

116
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,274
I'm so ashamed I could die!

117
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,326
Come, Adelaide.
Leave them to drink to our ill fortune.

118
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,782
Father!

119
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:11,790
Let those two devils sulk.
I'll soon make it up to them.

120
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,497
I'll set out for port tomorrow
and settle my affairs.

121
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,999
They'll be married
to a duke and a prince!

122
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,334
Gentlemen!

123
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,932
Bring us back
some brocade dresses.

124
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,386
Jewels, fans
and ostrich feathers!

125
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,438
I want the whole town
to die of envy!

126
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:35,230
A monkey!
I'd like a monkey.

127
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,436
A parrot.

128
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,456
What shall I bring back
for you, Belle?

129
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,664
Father, bring me a rose.

130
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,037
There aren't any around here.

131
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,940
If I don't pay up tonight,
they'll throw me in prison.

132
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,326
A moneylender is quick to understand.
I told him the whole story.

133
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,121
Lay it on thick.
Here he comes.

134
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:36,211
It's a very large sum.

135
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,164
You know one of the lost ships
has made it back to port.

136
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,251
I'll pay you as soon as
my father returns.

137
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:45,839
You know the law: if you can't pay,
I can sue your father for it.

138
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:49,809
If your father can't pay,
I'll take his furnishings.

139
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,225
Sign it.
What can you lose?

140
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,820
What can I do, sir?

141
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:12,577
If nothing's left from the last ship,
what's to become of me?

142
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:16,456
Your creditors in the port were
quicker than those in town. Sue them.

143
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,630
I don't even have money
to stay at the inn in town.

144
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,378
Then return home.

145
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,551
Cross the forest in the dark of night?
I'll get lost.

146
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,629
You crossed it at night to get here.

147
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,966
But there was a moon out then.
Now there's a fog.

148
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,176
I tell you, I'll get lost.
- Get lost, then!

149
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,263
Easy for you to say!
I'd like to see you in my shoes.

150
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,764
It's frightening!

151
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,394
Is anybody there?

152
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,336
Is anyone there?

153
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,426
Anybody there?

154
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,745
Hello?

155
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,765
Hello?

156
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:03,748
So, my dear sir,

157
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,759
you steal my roses.

158
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:11,175
You steal my roses,

159
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:14,474
the things I love most
in all the world.

160
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:17,519
Your luck has gone
from bad to worse.

161
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:21,224
You could have taken anything -
except my roses.

162
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:26,232
The punishment
for this simple theft

163
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:27,938
is death!

164
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,240
Sir, I didn't know.
I meant no harm.

165
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,947
My daughter asked me
to bring her a rose.

166
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:35,324
Don't address me as "sir".

167
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,118
I'm called the Beast!

168
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,917
I don't like compliments.

169
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,247
Don't try to understand.

170
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,166
You have 15 minutes

171
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,461
to prepare to die.

172
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,420
- Sir -
- Again!

173
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,380
The Beast orders you to be silent.

174
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,600
You stole a rose,
so you must die.

175
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:01,521
Unless one of your daughters -

176
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:04,270
How many do you have?
- Three.

177
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:09,446
Unless one of your daughters
agrees to pay your debt

178
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,655
and take your place.

179
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,701
Don't argue. Be off!

180
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,370
Make the most of the chance
I've offered you.

181
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,699
And should your daughters refuse
to die in your place,

182
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:24,499
swear to return in three days.
Swear it!

183
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,375
I swear.

184
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:30,300
But how will I find my way home?
I got lost in the forest.

185
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,719
You'll find a white horse
in my stables.

186
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,680
His name is Magnifique.

187
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:39,806
Whisper in his ear,
'Go where I am going, Magnifique.

188
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,638
Go, go, go!'

189
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,940
He'll take you home
and bring you back to my castle,

190
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:49,645
should your daughters prove too cowardly
to ride him in your place.

191
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,354
Go now!

192
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:35,069
I don't remember if the journey
was quick or endless.

193
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,280
Magnifique is in our stable.

194
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,658
That's my story.

195
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,454
Take this rose, Belle.

196
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,412
It has cost me dear.

197
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:52,545
That's what happens when a fool
asks you to bring her a rose.

198
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,842
See what her pride has caused!

199
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,883
She tried to teach us a lesson
by acting the picture of modesty!

200
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,885
She's not even crying!

201
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,764
You won't die, Father.
It's my fault.

202
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:06,312
It's only right that I go in your place.
- Are you crazy?

203
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,899
Ludovic and I will go
and kill this awful beast!

204
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:13,899
His power is too great.
You could never destroy him.

205
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,821
Don't you worry, Belle.

206
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,275
I am old, and I gave my word.
I will go.

207
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,988
You will not go, Father.
You can still win your case.

208
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,991
- How will we get by?
- Sell my furniture.

209
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,169
Why don't you go, Felicity?

210
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,372
You're too tough to eat!

211
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,879
Too bad the Beast
doesn't want a boy.

212
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,755
He could eat you
and die of poisoning!

213
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,086
Children, please.

214
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,427
Father, I'd rather be eaten alive
by that monster

215
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,221
than die of grief at your loss.

216
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,856
- You will not go to that monster!
- What business is it of yours?

217
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,481
It's mine if I say it is!

218
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:57,405
Do you love the little fool?
You make a fine pair!

219
00:26:57,491 --> 00:27:00,074
- Avenant, slap her!
- Calm down.

220
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,948
Repeat what you just said.

221
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,488
A pair of fools!

222
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,954
He struck me!
- Brute! Scoundrel!

223
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:12,162
- You dare slap my sister?
- You want one too? I've got plenty!

224
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,673
Cheat! Thief!

225
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,672
My children!

226
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,967
- Ludovic, he's ill.
- Let's take him to his room.

227
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:46,204
- He struck me, Adelaide!
- We don't have a penny left.

228
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,118
We mustn't lose our heads.

229
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:51,326
The Beast will devour them all,
and we'll marry princes!

230
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,503
Go where I am going,
Magnifique.

231
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,585
Go, go, go!

232
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:29,969
Belle, I am the door
to your room.

233
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:24,599
I am your mirror, Belle.

234
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:29,195
Reflect in your heart for me,
and I will reflect for you.

235
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,000
Where are you going?

236
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:21,085
Belle, you mustn't look
into my eyes.

237
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:24,388
You needn't fear.
You will never see me,

238
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:28,809
except each evening at 7:00,

239
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,388
when you will dine,

240
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:35,600
and I will come to the great hall.

241
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:41,614
And never look into my eyes.

242
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,087
Don't be afraid.

243
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:42,383
I'm not.

244
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:48,514
Will you permit me
to watch you dine?

245
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,433
You are the master.

246
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:59,730
There is no master here but you.

247
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:11,370
I disgust you.

248
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:16,326
You find me repulsive.

249
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,328
I cannot lie, Beast.

250
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,629
Everything here is
at your command.

251
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,969
I don't feel at ease in all this finery,

252
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,718
and I'm not used to being waited on.

253
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,926
But I sense you are doing
everything possible

254
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,183
to help me forget your ugliness.

255
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:50,068
I have a good heart,

256
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:55,497
but I am a monster.

257
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,619
There are men
far more monstrous than you,

258
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,704
though they conceal it well.

259
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:05,754
Besides being hideous,

260
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,969
I'm not quick-witted.

261
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:12,806
You're quick enough
to recognise it.

262
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:18,019
Everything in this castle is yours.

263
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:23,100
Make your slightest whim known.

264
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:37,623
I shall appear
every evening at 7:00.

265
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:44,668
Then, before taking my leave,
I will ask you one question.

266
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,212
Always the same question.

267
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:49,385
What is that question?

268
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:56,805
Will you be my wife?

269
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,391
No, Beast!

270
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:08,608
Goodbye, then, Belle.

271
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,403
Until tomorrow.

272
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,944
Where is Belle?

273
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:34,749
- Why are you in my room?
- I wanted - I was just -

274
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:38,924
I came to bring you a gift.

275
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,883
Get out!

276
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,732
Get out.

277
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:30,679
I thought you'd be
having supper, Belle.

278
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:36,056
I'm not hungry.
I'd rather walk with you.

279
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:40,643
You do me a great honour.

280
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:52,868
A great honour.

281
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:56,660
Your voice seems softer.

282
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:05,922
Are your days here terribly boring?

283
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:08,626
I do find the days long.

284
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:12,554
I confess, this evening
I was looking forward to 7:00.

285
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:17,467
Your kindness encourages me
to ask once again

286
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,895
the question that torments my soul.

287
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:24,813
Go ahead and ask.
My answer will always be the same.

288
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:28,820
Let us be friends, Beast.
Don't ask me for more.

289
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,692
And what do you do all day?

290
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,412
Are you listening to me?

291
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,408
I'm talking to you.

292
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,962
Forgive me.

293
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,795
Where are you, Beast?

294
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:59,013
Forgive me.

295
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,689
It's nothing.

296
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,637
What's the matter?

297
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,645
I'm thirsty.

298
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,535
Drink from my hands.

299
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:17,675
It doesn't repulse you
to let me drink from your hands?

300
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:23,051
No, Beast. I like it.

301
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:27,560
I'd never want to cause you
the slightest harm.

302
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:34,029
But still,

303
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:39,947
you dream of being
far away from me.

304
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,482
You're very late.

305
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:19,574
Thank you for noticing, Belle.

306
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:24,697
I confess I was
very impatient to see you.

307
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,995
I must speak with you!
- Belle!

308
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,247
I can't live
without seeing my father.

309
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:34,256
Please, let me go.
- Get up, Belle!

310
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:42,430
It is I who should kneel

311
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:44,967
and take orders from you.

312
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,768
Let me go and then come back.

313
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:52,933
When you return,

314
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,897
will you be my wife?

315
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:59,406
You're killing me.

316
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:03,277
I know I'm horrible to look at.

317
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:08,995
But I would die of grief
if I let you go

318
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:14,371
and you didn't return.

319
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:18,004
I'll return in a week.

320
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:21,336
I care for you too much
to want to cause your death.

321
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,595
You stroke me

322
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,928
the way one strokes an animal.

323
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:32,810
But you are an animal.

324
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:41,106
What you ask is
a very serious matter.

325
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:44,447
I must think about it.

326
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,875
Will you walk with me
to the garden?

327
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:21,401
Has another asked for your hand
in marriage?

328
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,902
Yes, Beast.

329
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:40,294
Who proposed to you?

330
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,385
A young man?

331
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:46,797
Yes, Beast.

332
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,716
Was he handsome?

333
00:53:49,852 --> 00:53:52,060
Yes.

334
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:56,564
Why didn't you marry him?

335
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:59,484
I couldn't leave my father.

336
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:06,279
What was this handsome
young man's name?

337
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,360
Avenant.

338
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,507
What's the matter?

339
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:28,554
Beast, what's wrong?

340
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:13,095
What are you doing
at my door at this hour?

341
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,183
Heavens!

342
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:20,849
You're covered with blood!

343
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:24,778
- Forgive me.
- What should I forgive you for?

344
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:31,033
For being a beast.

345
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:35,370
Forgive me.

346
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:41,703
Those words are not worthy of you.

347
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:43,914
Aren't you ashamed?

348
00:55:45,384 --> 00:55:47,125
Clean yourself up

349
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,007
and go to bed.

350
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:59,892
Close your door!

351
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:06,736
Quickly!
Close your door!

352
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:10,899
Your look burns like fire.

353
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:15,074
I cannot bear you
to look at me like that.

354
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,591
They're taking everything.

355
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:35,549
You'll see -
they'll take our table, too.

356
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:38,931
Let's play.

357
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:45,734
Go speak with your father.
He doesn't understand, of course.

358
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:48,812
It's not my place
to tell him the truth.

359
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,730
Go on.

360
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:17,264
Ludovic, confess it was you.

361
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,559
To tell the truth, yes, it was.

362
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:23,184
Ludovic, this is your doing.

363
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:39,204
The gentlemen's very ill.
You must leave him his bed.

364
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,281
We always leave the beds.

365
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:44,163
I bet you those women
find a way to keep their things.

366
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,744
I have a guarantee
for your sisters.

367
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:53,467
Give me a hand.

368
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:21,738
Are you ill?

369
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:26,793
Yes, Beast, I am.

370
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:31,839
What is it?

371
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,252
My father is dying.

372
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:39,965
I can't bear to see you ill.

373
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:41,974
Send me home to my father.

374
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:45,978
If I accept,

375
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:50,396
do you swear to return in a week?

376
00:58:53,822 --> 00:58:55,859
I swear.

377
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:06,658
Come.

378
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:24,843
Look over there, Belle.

379
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:28,516
Do you see that pavilion?

380
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:32,730
It's called Diana's Pavilion.

381
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:38,611
It's the only place in my domain
where no one may enter.

382
00:59:38,784 --> 00:59:41,527
Not you and not I.

383
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:48,624
All I possess,
I possess by the power of magic.

384
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:55,757
But my true riches
are in that pavilion,

385
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:59,799
and one can only enter
with a golden key.

386
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,465
Here it is.

387
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:10,313
I give you the greatest possible
proof of trust

388
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,725
that one can give in this world.

389
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,104
If you do not return,

390
01:00:19,074 --> 01:00:21,191
I will die.

391
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:25,779
After my death,

392
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:29,700
you will be safely out of danger,

393
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:32,251
and my riches will be yours.

394
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:35,125
Take the key.

395
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:39,084
I know your soul.

396
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:43,137
This key, delivered into your hands,

397
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:46,299
will be the pledge of your return.

398
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:49,886
Then you agree to send me back
to my father?

399
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,017
You'll be there this very morning.

400
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:55,691
Night is not the same here
as where you come from.

401
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:58,731
Here, it's night.

402
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:02,402
In your world, it's day.

403
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:14,252
A rose with its role to play,

404
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:17,918
my mirror, my golden key,

405
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:21,088
my horse and my glove

406
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:24,671
are the five secrets of my power.

407
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:28,265
I entrust them to you.

408
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:32,140
You have only to put this glove
on your right hand

409
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:36,558
and you'll be transported
wherever you wish.

410
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:50,906
Remember your promise.

411
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:02,918
Farewell, Belle.

412
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:18,083
- I'm dreaming.
- No, Father, you're not.

413
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:19,876
It's really me - Belle.

414
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:22,376
Thinking you were dead,
I myself was dying.

415
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:26,960
Did you escape?
- No, the Beast let me come see you.

416
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:31,179
- Then that monster has a soul?
- He suffers.

417
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:34,304
One half of him is in constant
struggle with the other half.

418
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:37,637
He's more cruel to himself
than he is to human beings.

419
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:40,098
Belle, I saw him.
That face is hideous.

420
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,899
At first I was indeed afraid, Father.

421
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:47,314
Now I sometimes feel
like bursting out laughing.

422
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:50,487
But then I look into his eyes,

423
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:52,489
and they're so sad

424
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:54,662
that I have to turn away
to keep from crying.

425
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:57,957
Don't tell me you've agreed
to live with that monster!

426
01:03:58,043 --> 01:04:00,160
I must, Father.

427
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:04,247
Certain powers obey him,
while there are others he must obey.

428
01:04:04,716 --> 01:04:08,960
If I ran away, I'd cause great harm
to him - and to you.

429
01:04:09,054 --> 01:04:10,670
Does he threaten you?

430
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:14,348
He comes to me only at times when
his cruelty is not too frightening.

431
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:18,178
Sometimes his bearing
is almost noble.

432
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:23,141
Other times, he's unsteady
and seems stricken with some infirmity.

433
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:26,269
You manage to feel sorry for him?

434
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:28,980
I bear his presence,

435
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:32,158
because I'd be happy if I could
make him forget his ugliness.

436
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:35,611
Your goodness will cost you dearly,
my Belle.

437
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:40,492
Father, that monster is good.

438
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:46,247
My heavens!
A diamond!

439
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,586
And another.

440
01:04:52,764 --> 01:04:55,222
Proof that the spirits
are keeping him safe

441
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:57,095
because I cried for him.

442
01:04:57,185 --> 01:04:59,347
These diamonds could be
the devil's work.

443
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:02,646
Put your mind at ease, Father.
They are yours to keep.

444
01:05:02,774 --> 01:05:05,858
He's given them to you.
They'll bring you life.

445
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:09,604
But if you tell my sisters,
they'll take the diamonds

446
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:11,780
and leave you with nothing.

447
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,087
I'd rather sleep in sheets
than hang them up.

448
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:37,138
Look at my hands!

449
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:39,012
Appalling!

450
01:05:39,144 --> 01:05:42,512
Look at mine!
Reduced to being a cook!

451
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:46,432
My dear princesses,
when you're poor, you work!

452
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:49,811
- Imbecile!
- You should talk, you swindler!

453
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:53,030
If it weren't for you,
we'd still have a servant.

454
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:54,982
It was my fault.

455
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:58,327
Kindly take note that
I am paying for it in the flesh.

456
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:02,282
When you're not drinking
or gambling.

457
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:06,206
Such charming creatures!

458
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:09,588
How is your father this morning?

459
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:12,295
You think they take care of him?

460
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:15,670
I'm the one looking after him.

461
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:19,887
He's still very weak
and cannot stand.

462
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:23,762
Felicity, Adelaide, Ludovic!

463
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:25,391
For heaven's sake!

464
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:30,267
An elegant woman,
and Father standing at her side!

465
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:32,604
And us without our finery!

466
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:34,404
It's Belle!

467
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:37,529
- Belle? Impossible.
- But it is.

468
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:46,583
Go away!

469
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,535
As charming as ever.

470
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:52,881
Belle came to my room
and restored me to health.

471
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,674
Where did you come from?

472
01:06:57,055 --> 01:06:59,513
What a magnificent necklace!

473
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:02,849
You take it, Felicity.

474
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:05,185
It will look even more
magnificent on you.

475
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:08,765
- My God!
- Drop it this instant!

476
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:18,983
The Beast meant it for you alone.

477
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:21,986
You can't give it to anyone else.

478
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:26,499
Come, Adelaide, let's get dressed.
What must we look like?

479
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:30,954
Goodbye, my lovelies!

480
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:43,511
Who did my washing?

481
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:45,513
We did.

482
01:07:47,105 --> 01:07:49,222
The sheets are dragging
on the ground.

483
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:52,308
So, he's not a ferocious beast?

484
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:55,110
No, he's a good beast.

485
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:57,779
You're not going back, are you?

486
01:07:57,865 --> 01:07:59,481
Yes, Avenant. I promised.

487
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:01,784
The Beast freed me
for just one week.

488
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:06,034
If I don't return,
he'll die of grief.

489
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,458
Do you love him?

490
01:08:09,544 --> 01:08:11,957
No, Avenant.

491
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:14,542
I'm fond of him.

492
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:17,166
It's not the same thing.

493
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:20,924
The Church Tribunal
will be quite interested

494
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:24,098
in the display of witchcraft
we just witnessed.

495
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:27,927
Goodbye for now.

496
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,391
Let's go in the shed.

497
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:37,853
We can have a serious talk now.
They won't hear us.

498
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:39,772
So tell us.

499
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:50,537
He's entrusted me
with the key to his treasure.

500
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:53,080
He has complete confidence in me.

501
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:55,788
I'd be the monster
if I were to not return.

502
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:58,750
How many servants wait on you?

503
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:00,709
Invisible hands serve me.

504
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,715
They dress me
and arrange my hair.

505
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:06,048
They open and close the doors.
I never see a soul.

506
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,680
Does this Beast speak
the language of men?

507
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:11,387
Yes. He speaks like you and me.

508
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:14,474
Does he crawl on four legs?
What does he eat and drink?

509
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:17,814
I've given him water
to drink on occasion.

510
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:21,196
He would never eat me.

511
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:27,702
- Can you imagine?
- Incredible.

512
01:09:27,789 --> 01:09:31,282
That little fool is happier
than we are. She's rich!

513
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:33,914
There are a lot of other husbands
with beards and horns.

514
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:37,292
- She's so proud she could burst.
- Don't worry.

515
01:09:37,382 --> 01:09:39,840
I've got a good head
on these shoulders.

516
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:42,380
We'll be very friendly

517
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:44,803
and let the boys worm
the information out of her.

518
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:48,882
How much do you have on you?

519
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:53,972
There. It's frightening.

520
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:58,817
We must act.
I've come to a decision.

521
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:01,190
There's nothing more we can do.

522
01:10:02,073 --> 01:10:06,033
I can't stand the idea of Belle
returning to that beast tomorrow.

523
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:08,277
We must kill him.

524
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:10,033
And take his treasure.

525
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:13,082
But do you realise
we're dealing with magic powers?

526
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:17,002
I don't believe in magic powers.

527
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:19,421
The Beast hypnotises her
to see what he wants her to.

528
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:21,169
I'm scared.

529
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:24,919
No power in the world can frighten me
when it comes to rescuing Belle.

530
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:27,467
Besides, we have no choice.

531
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:30,095
Convince your sisters
there's something in it for them.

532
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:32,426
They'll stop Belle from leaving.

533
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,853
Dazzle them with the treasure.

534
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:38,015
How will you ever find
the Beast's castle?

535
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:40,226
I'll ask Belle.

536
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:42,481
I'll pry the secret out of her.

537
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:57,997
We'll rub our eyes with onions
to make us cry.

538
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:00,170
She'll smell it.

539
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:02,168
Ludovic's ideas are always
so distasteful!

540
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,500
The little fool's
too stupid to notice.

541
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:07,587
Ludovic's idea isn't so dumb.
Help me.

542
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:11,764
Delightful.

543
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:13,843
Hurry up!

544
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:25,776
Belle, you mustn't leave us.
You can't go.

545
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,783
Stay here with us.

546
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:31,952
We haven't always been fair to you,

547
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:35,372
but now that we might lose you,
we realise how much we love you.

548
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:36,539
Are you crying?

549
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:40,745
If the Beast really loves you,
he'll let you stay longer.

550
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:43,956
- Stay another week.
- Impossible.

551
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,134
Do you want your father
and sisters to die of grief?

552
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:50,887
Stay with us, Belle.

553
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:54,387
- I can't.
- Don't be like that. Stay!

554
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:56,809
Adelaide, my little sister.

555
01:11:56,896 --> 01:11:58,512
Adelaide was just saying,

556
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:02,437
'Now I see who our Belle really is.
I'll die if she leaves us.'

557
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:06,316
- Don't tempt me.
- Don't leave us tomorrow.

558
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:11,491
Explain to the Beast
it's your sisters' fault.

559
01:12:11,536 --> 01:12:14,324
I didn't know
you loved me so much.

560
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,577
You're an angel!

561
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:21,835
We're so happy.

562
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,503
We're so very, very happy!

563
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:34,256
She's crying.

564
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:37,058
She'll stay,
and we'll share the treasure.

565
01:12:37,144 --> 01:12:39,727
Let's go and wash.
You stink!

566
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,519
- Well?
- Well, what?

567
01:12:43,651 --> 01:12:45,267
- Is she staying?
- Yes.

568
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,694
- Do you have the key?
- Give it here.

569
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:50,488
- What do you take me for?
- We know what you'll do. It's gold!

570
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:52,320
- You idiot!
- Don't start again.

571
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:54,447
I'll give it to Avenant
if he decides to go.

572
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:58,121
You women are too much!
Where's he going to go, and how?

573
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,290
We'll let him figure that out!

574
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:05,413
Belle, you seem sad.

575
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:07,463
No, Father.

576
01:13:08,259 --> 01:13:11,468
She misses her luxuries.
Our banality disgusts her.

577
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:13,386
Felicity!

578
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:17,386
The Beast undoubtedly possesses
charms that we lack.

579
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:22,892
Mademoiselle must think
she's too grand to wait on us now.

580
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:39,738
What have they done to you now?

581
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:42,036
It was your sisters.

582
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:44,743
They don't waste any time,
the wretches!

583
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,579
Belle, listen to me.

584
01:13:50,051 --> 01:13:52,088
Don't cry.

585
01:13:53,471 --> 01:13:55,884
I must wake you
from this nightmare.

586
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:57,839
I have to take you away.

587
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:01,473
I know what you're thinking,
that I'm just a scoundrel.

588
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:05,431
But at your side I will work!
We'll leave this town and these taverns.

589
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:09,397
Answer me.
What is it?

590
01:14:11,906 --> 01:14:13,818
I see - it's the Beast.

591
01:14:13,908 --> 01:14:17,367
Tell me how to reach his castle,
and I'll go and kill him.

592
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,782
You don't answer.

593
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:28,746
I knew it.
He's worked some charm on you.

594
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:32,295
Or else that heart of yours
that I know so well

595
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:34,968
cannot bring itself
to wish him evil.

596
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:40,391
Belle, I assure you,
if that monster suffered as I do,

597
01:14:40,601 --> 01:14:44,220
he would rush to your side
and carry you off with him.

598
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:48,686
I assure you,
he's forgotten you.

599
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:24,296
Come in, quick.
They won't find us here.

600
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:27,053
You're late, as usual.

601
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:34,560
Well?

602
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:37,017
My mind's made up.
There's no going back.

603
01:17:37,862 --> 01:17:40,900
That's fine, but how will we get
to the Beast's castle?

604
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:43,277
Didn't you find out her secret?

605
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:45,279
She only says
what the Beast allows her to.

606
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:48,237
We know all the other details,
but she wouldn't tell us that.

607
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:51,664
I'll get it out of her.
I'll torture her!

608
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:54,618
Do that and you can count me out.

609
01:17:56,046 --> 01:17:57,708
What's that?

610
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:01,337
I'll go and see.

611
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:23,947
A lone white horse.

612
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:26,449
It's Magnifique.
I'm sure of it!

613
01:18:27,077 --> 01:18:29,410
He jumped the fence
and entered the courtyard.

614
01:18:34,919 --> 01:18:37,161
Heaven sent him to us.

615
01:18:37,421 --> 01:18:40,004
- Hell, more likely.
- I'm afraid.

616
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:43,174
Shut up, idiot!
Bring the horse in, quietly.

617
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:45,217
Don't anyone go out there.

618
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:47,216
I'm going.

619
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:29,922
The Beast sent him here to get Belle.
Perfect timing!

620
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:33,759
The horse will take
you and Ludovic instead.

621
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:36,261
- It's all right for you to talk!
- Are you a man or a woman?

622
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:39,314
- I'd like to see you go.
- We've no time to lose.

623
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:46,279
Get on behind me, Ludovic.
- God save us!

624
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,525
Your bows!

625
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:54,116
What's that in my way?

626
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:55,455
A sack.

627
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:58,625
If it's gold, it'll change to straw
if I touch it. You open it.

628
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:01,370
A mirror!

629
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:04,376
To reflect the ugly heart of a girl
who breaks her promises.

630
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:06,879
See? The Beast isn't
so stupid after all.

631
01:20:06,969 --> 01:20:09,677
Here's the key.
Off you go, and good luck.

632
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:15,058
- I forgot the magic words.
- It's something like "go, go, go".

633
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:17,685
We'd be in fine shape
if we had to count on you.

634
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:20,639
'Go where I am going, Magnifique.
Go, go, go.'

635
01:20:35,414 --> 01:20:37,497
Ludovic!

636
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:40,788
What's wrong with you?

637
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:44,128
Have we sent them to their deaths?

638
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:45,830
Fool!

639
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:47,210
The mirror!

640
01:20:54,558 --> 01:20:56,390
I have an uneasy feeling.

641
01:20:56,477 --> 01:20:58,560
Look at yourself.
You're green!

642
01:21:01,398 --> 01:21:03,230
Look!

643
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:07,315
What do you see?
- Nothing.

644
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:11,485
Let's take it to Belle.
It's her turn.

645
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:23,994
Mademoiselle dresses up
like a princess

646
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:26,125
when she thinks she's all alone, eh?

647
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:28,252
Who do you think you are?

648
01:21:28,342 --> 01:21:31,961
This mirror was mysteriously left
for you on the doorstep.

649
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:35,763
You'll see what kind of beauty
pleases a Beast!

650
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:15,981
The key!

651
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:27,742
The key!

652
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:37,176
Where is it?

653
01:24:04,373 --> 01:24:06,535
My Beast!

654
01:24:27,354 --> 01:24:29,391
My Beast!

655
01:24:44,413 --> 01:24:46,405
Answer me, Beast!

656
01:25:01,221 --> 01:25:02,928
Forgive me.

657
01:25:06,184 --> 01:25:09,268
Answer me, Beast.
Look at me.

658
01:25:10,981 --> 01:25:13,394
Your glove will revive you.

659
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:18,903
Help me.

660
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:24,192
I am the monster.

661
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:28,288
You will live.
- Too late.

662
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:41,793
- Are we there?
- Yes.

663
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:46,093
First we have to kill the Beast.
- We'll take care of that later.

664
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:55,806
Do you have the key?

665
01:26:01,114 --> 01:26:02,776
Stop.

666
01:26:03,784 --> 01:26:06,777
That golden key could set off
some diabolical device.

667
01:26:07,454 --> 01:26:09,741
We have to be careful.
- Right.

668
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:14,167
We won't use the door.
Follow me.

669
01:26:27,974 --> 01:26:29,556
Climb up.

670
01:26:31,061 --> 01:26:33,724
Be brave!
You're scared, as usual.

671
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:35,771
I'm not scared.
I'm just thinking.

672
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:37,723
Same thing.

673
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,527
Are you coming?

674
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:57,368
- Where are we?
- On some kind of glass panels.

675
01:27:08,598 --> 01:27:10,134
Look!

676
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:13,384
Amazing!

677
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:20,100
What's that?

678
01:27:22,404 --> 01:27:23,815
It's Diana.

679
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:25,567
Don't be a coward!

680
01:27:25,657 --> 01:27:28,741
Use those powerful claws
to hold on to life!

681
01:27:28,827 --> 01:27:32,116
Fight! Get up
and let out a roar!

682
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:34,242
Scare death away!

683
01:27:34,332 --> 01:27:35,994
Belle,

684
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,912
if I were a man...

685
01:27:42,716 --> 01:27:47,381
perhaps I could do as you say.

686
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:54,642
But poor beasts

687
01:27:55,729 --> 01:27:58,392
who wish to prove their love

688
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:04,186
can only grovel on the ground

689
01:28:07,866 --> 01:28:09,858
and die.

690
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:22,374
- I'll break the glass.
- Be careful.

691
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:33,886
Glass is just glass.

692
01:28:35,936 --> 01:28:37,928
Hold on to my hands.

693
01:28:38,063 --> 01:28:40,350
I'll lower myself down
and jump to the ground.

694
01:28:40,524 --> 01:28:42,641
- It's too high.
- I'll jump.

695
01:28:42,943 --> 01:28:46,687
- How do we get the treasure out?
- Don't worry. First we have to get in.

696
01:28:48,657 --> 01:28:52,071
Stand firm and get a good grip.

697
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:04,666
Wait a minute.
Don't let go yet.

698
01:29:05,298 --> 01:29:07,381
Don't let go until I tell you.

699
01:29:23,149 --> 01:29:25,106
Where is the Beast?

700
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:32,399
He is no more.
It was I, Belle.

701
01:29:32,951 --> 01:29:35,034
My parents didn't believe
in magic spirits,

702
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:38,909
so the spirits took their revenge
through me.

703
01:29:38,999 --> 01:29:41,662
I could only be saved

704
01:29:42,502 --> 01:29:45,540
by a loving look.

705
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:51,130
Can such miracles really happen?

706
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:54,428
You and I are living proof.

707
01:29:54,764 --> 01:29:58,849
Love can turn
a man into a beast.

708
01:29:59,978 --> 01:30:03,813
But love can also make
an ugly man handsome.

709
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:07,896
What's wrong, Belle?

710
01:30:07,944 --> 01:30:10,357
It's almost as if
you miss my ugliness.

711
01:30:10,947 --> 01:30:13,314
It's not that, my lord.

712
01:30:14,618 --> 01:30:17,736
But you look like someone
I used to know.

713
01:30:18,455 --> 01:30:20,162
Who?

714
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:22,247
My brother's friend.

715
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:24,701
Did you love him?

716
01:30:25,003 --> 01:30:26,710
Yes.

717
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:30,585
Did he know?

718
01:30:34,512 --> 01:30:37,300
But you did love the Beast?

719
01:30:38,475 --> 01:30:39,682
Yes.

720
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:47,856
You're a strange girl, Belle.

721
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:51,898
A strange girl.

722
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:55,986
At your service.

723
01:30:56,701 --> 01:31:00,741
Are you disappointed
that I look like your brother's friend?

724
01:31:02,999 --> 01:31:04,410
Yes.

725
01:31:13,051 --> 01:31:16,044
The first time
I took you in my arms,

726
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:18,428
I was the Beast.

727
01:31:21,518 --> 01:31:23,680
Are you happy?

728
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:26,767
I'll have to get used to it.

729
01:31:27,691 --> 01:31:29,557
Where will you take me?

730
01:31:29,651 --> 01:31:33,440
To my kingdom,
where you'll be a great queen.

731
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:37,986
There you'll be reunited
with your father,

732
01:31:38,201 --> 01:31:41,444
and your sisters
will carry the train of your gown.

733
01:31:41,579 --> 01:31:43,241
Is it far?

734
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:45,698
We'll fly through the air.

735
01:31:49,671 --> 01:31:51,708
You won't be frightened?

736
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:54,798
I don't mind being frightened...

737
01:31:56,428 --> 01:31:58,169
with you.

738
01:32:37,093 --> 01:32:39,631
I'm taking you away.

739
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:43,096
Off we go.

740
01:33:31,815 --> 01:33:34,808
THE END
