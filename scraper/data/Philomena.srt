1
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,209
Blood glucose fine.
Liver function, kidney function, normal.

2
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,919
Platelet count's normal.
Haemoglobin levels normal.

3
00:00:47,086 --> 00:00:49,751
Blood pressure, 131 over 92.

4
00:00:50,545 --> 00:00:52,043
Isn't this a little high?

5
00:00:52,376 --> 00:00:55,792
Weight's fine. Could do with losing
a centimetre or two off your waist.

6
00:00:55,961 --> 00:00:58,292
- Oh. Stool sample outstanding.
- Oh.

7
00:00:59,045 --> 00:01:01,586
No, that means
you haven't provided one yet.

8
00:01:01,753 --> 00:01:03,837
Yes, of course. No, I'd remember.

9
00:01:04,003 --> 00:01:06,502
You think it didn't stink or something?

10
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,795
There's nothing wrong with you, Martin.

11
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:12,254
Uh, your wife tells me
you think you're mildly depressed?

12
00:01:12,422 --> 00:01:14,421
Well, I got the sack. I'm unemployed.

13
00:01:14,588 --> 00:01:17,588
- Yes. But it wasn't your fault, was it?
- That's why I'm depressed.

14
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:20,046
I got sacked for saying something
I didn't say.

15
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:21,297
Try running.

16
00:01:21,465 --> 00:01:23,463
I said the opposite of what I was sacked for.

17
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,380
What are you working on at the moment?

18
00:01:25,548 --> 00:01:27,423
Uh, thinking of writing a book.

19
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:29,672
Oh! Well, that's good. What's it about?

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,089
Russian history.

21
00:01:32,255 --> 00:01:33,631
Try running.

22
00:01:33,798 --> 00:01:37,006
The Whitehall feud between
the transport secretary Stephen Byers

23
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:40,840
and his former press secretary
Martin Sixsmith continues to grow.

24
00:01:41,008 --> 00:01:43,757
Mr Sixsmith has been putting his side of the argument.

25
00:01:43,926 --> 00:01:46,424
Downing Street described the affair as a soap opera.

26
00:01:46,592 --> 00:01:49,592
REPORTER: There was no sign of Mr Sixsmith
at his home today,

27
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,425
but after a week of trying to clear his name
in private, he's now gone public.

28
00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:58,884
He told the Sunday Times that senior figures
in government had offered him support.

29
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:03,093
"They assured me they accepted there was
no suspicion of misconduct against me.

30
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,343
I was therefore amazed
they had unilaterally 'resigned' me."

31
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,135
CHOIR: ♪ Mother Of God Here I Stand

32
00:02:08,303 --> 00:02:19,178
♪ Before this icon
of your radiant brightness

33
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:28,054
♪ Not praying to be saved...

34
00:02:28,222 --> 00:02:31,430
I would like to make a statement
regarding the circumstances

35
00:02:31,597 --> 00:02:33,888
of Mr Martin Sixsmith's resignation.

36
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:39,263
The question here is, how long can Mr Blair
stand by his man and not himself be damaged?

37
00:02:39,431 --> 00:02:43,264
There's no doubt that there's been yet
another embarrassment for the government.

38
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:47,431
They've not only had to eat
fantastic quantities of humble pie,

39
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:51,139
indeed humble pie, I would say,
with a side order of grovel sauce.

40
00:02:51,975 --> 00:02:54,432
And so far as Mr Sixsmith is concerned...

41
00:03:06,434 --> 00:03:09,226
There you are.
Well, that was embarrassing.

42
00:03:09,393 --> 00:03:12,518
Father Tierney just asked me
where you disappeared to.

43
00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:17,352
Well... I don't believe in God.
And I think he can tell.

44
00:03:18,185 --> 00:03:20,059
Come on.

45
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:23,060
- I'm worried about you, Martin.
- I did that.

46
00:03:23,228 --> 00:03:25,811
I wish you had. You need to get back to work.

47
00:03:25,978 --> 00:03:28,102
What happened to that book
on Russian history?

48
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,894
No one's interested in Russian bloody history.

49
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:52,065
(Faint voices)

50
00:03:55,022 --> 00:03:57,146
(Children squealing in background)

51
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:02,815
(Girl giggling)

52
00:04:28,944 --> 00:04:31,902
I haven't seen you any place.
Where are you from?

53
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,236
Are you from Limerick, then?

54
00:04:44,696 --> 00:04:46,737
- Hello, Philomena.
- Father.

55
00:04:46,904 --> 00:04:49,819
How have you been? How's your new hip?

56
00:04:50,654 --> 00:04:53,821
Oh, it's very good. It's titanium.

57
00:04:56,489 --> 00:04:59,905
- I haven't seen you for a while.
- I just came in to light a candle.

58
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:02,322
Someone special?

59
00:05:03,365 --> 00:05:05,279
Yes.

60
00:05:06,156 --> 00:05:07,364
(Fairground music)

61
00:05:07,532 --> 00:05:09,655
I like your dress.

62
00:05:09,822 --> 00:05:11,239
Did you make it yourself?

63
00:05:11,406 --> 00:05:14,239
No. I bought it in a shop.

64
00:05:15,241 --> 00:05:19,907
And anyways, me auntie told me I wasn't
supposed to speak to strange men like you.

65
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,284
WOMAN:
Did you let him put his hands on you?

66
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,326
ANOTHER WOMAN:
Did you enjoy your sin?

67
00:05:47,827 --> 00:05:49,744
Did you take your knickers down?

68
00:05:51,495 --> 00:05:54,995
Answer Sister Hildegarde.
Did you take them down?

69
00:05:56,204 --> 00:05:57,328
Yes.

70
00:05:59,328 --> 00:06:00,995
Oh, Reverend Mother,

71
00:06:01,162 --> 00:06:03,745
at school,
the sisters never taught us about babies.

72
00:06:03,912 --> 00:06:05,370
Did your mother not tell you?

73
00:06:05,537 --> 00:06:07,622
- Her mother died ten years ago.
- Oh.

74
00:06:07,788 --> 00:06:09,371
God rest her soul.

75
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,497
REVEREND MOTHER:
Don't dare blame the sisters for this.

76
00:06:16,665 --> 00:06:20,664
You are the cause of this shame.
You and your indecency.

77
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:22,498
(Doorbell)

78
00:06:23,915 --> 00:06:25,997
(Screams and sobs)

79
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:33,790
- (Screams)
- I don't know what to do!

80
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,958
We must get a doctor.
The baby's the wrong way round. It's breech!

81
00:06:38,126 --> 00:06:41,249
It's in God's hands now.
The pain is her penance.

82
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:46,000
Hail, holy Queen, Mother of Mercy!
Hail, holy Queen, Mother of Mercy!

83
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:48,626
(Reverend Mother continues praying)

84
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,419
Don't let her put my baby in the ground!

85
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:55,293
It's cold in there. It's dark in there.

86
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,709
(TV in background)

87
00:07:01,335 --> 00:07:04,335
Just go up and turn their lights out
in half an hour. OK?

88
00:07:04,503 --> 00:07:07,003
Doesn't she know you have a proper job?

89
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:10,169
She's short staffed. I'm just filling in.

90
00:07:12,046 --> 00:07:14,129
I'll be home before midnight.

91
00:07:17,046 --> 00:07:19,130
Mother?

92
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,504
What is it? Are you all right?

93
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:39,381
Who is it?

94
00:07:42,966 --> 00:07:45,048
It's his birthday.

95
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:48,299
He'll be 50 today.

96
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:54,383
(Screams)

97
00:07:54,549 --> 00:07:55,966
Breathe.

98
00:07:59,551 --> 00:08:01,259
It's a boy.

99
00:08:01,426 --> 00:08:03,634
(Baby cries)

100
00:08:29,429 --> 00:08:31,303
Oh, Martin!

101
00:08:31,471 --> 00:08:33,053
- Hello, David.
- Hello.

102
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,721
- Keith you know.
- Yes, hello again.

103
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,347
And Sally Mitchell, this is Martin Sixsmith,
used to be the BBC's man in Moscow.

104
00:08:40,515 --> 00:08:41,681
- And Washington.
- Hello.

105
00:08:41,848 --> 00:08:45,430
Then he became a spin doctor for the
government, and it all went a bit tits-up.

106
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:47,013
Is that a fair summation, Martin?

107
00:08:47,182 --> 00:08:51,015
That's fair enough. I always say,
"If you shovel shit for long enough,

108
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:53,098
eventually you'll get some on your shoes."

109
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,557
Yes, you got it on your head.
How did you manage that?

110
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:58,140
What are you up to at the moment?

111
00:08:58,308 --> 00:09:00,849
I'm thinking of writing a book on Russian history.

112
00:09:01,018 --> 00:09:03,725
Or something else.
Maybe get back into journalism.

113
00:09:03,893 --> 00:09:06,308
I remember you!

114
00:09:06,475 --> 00:09:08,516
You're the one who sent that terrible e-mail

115
00:09:08,684 --> 00:09:11,892
saying it was a good day
to bury bad news on 9/11.

116
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:14,432
- No, that was someone else.
- Well, I thought it was you.

117
00:09:14,602 --> 00:09:18,226
No, it's a common mistake.
On the day of Princess Margaret's funeral,

118
00:09:18,394 --> 00:09:21,351
I sent an e-mail saying
let's make sure the only thing we "bury",

119
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,434
- today, is Princess Margaret.
- Which is slightly different.

120
00:09:24,602 --> 00:09:26,560
It's very different, actually... But...

121
00:09:26,728 --> 00:09:29,602
If you want to get back into journalism,
you should talk to Sally.

122
00:09:29,771 --> 00:09:34,062
I just do sob stories, human interest.
It's not really your cup of tea, is it?

123
00:09:34,229 --> 00:09:35,187
Well...

124
00:09:35,354 --> 00:09:38,644
But I'll be happy to have a look
if you want to push any ideas my way.

125
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,894
Yes... Please.

126
00:09:48,272 --> 00:09:51,897
Excuse me.
Do you have a glass of Pinot Grigio?

127
00:09:53,024 --> 00:09:54,606
It's just red or white.

128
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:57,188
I'll have white, please.

129
00:09:58,857 --> 00:10:01,231
I couldn't help overhearing you're a journalist.

130
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:04,148
I know this woman,
she had a baby when she was a teenager

131
00:10:04,315 --> 00:10:06,731
and she's kept it secret for 50 years.

132
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,023
I only found out today.

133
00:10:09,857 --> 00:10:13,191
Sorry.
The baby was taken from her by these nuns.

134
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,441
- They made her have him adopted.
- Mm.

135
00:10:17,609 --> 00:10:20,441
And she's kept it a secret all this time.

136
00:10:21,152 --> 00:10:25,442
Well, the thing is, I'm working on a book
at the moment about Russian history.

137
00:10:25,609 --> 00:10:26,651
That's my thing.

138
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:30,318
And what you're talking about would be
what they call a human interest story.

139
00:10:30,486 --> 00:10:31,986
I don't do those.

140
00:10:32,861 --> 00:10:34,442
Why not?

141
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:39,652
Because "human interest story"
is a euphemism for stories about

142
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:42,194
weak-minded, vulnerable, ignorant people,

143
00:10:42,362 --> 00:10:46,654
to put in newspapers read by
vulnerable, weak-minded, ignorant people.

144
00:10:47,444 --> 00:10:51,404
Not that you are.
And, yeah, anyway, I hope you find him.

145
00:10:57,946 --> 00:11:00,531
Do you think I should do a human interest story?

146
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,864
Hello, you must be Philomena. I'm Martin.

147
00:11:20,032 --> 00:11:22,032
- Hello, Martin.
- Hello again.

148
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,198
Hello.

149
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:25,741
We've got a table through here. After you.

150
00:11:26,743 --> 00:11:28,824
Just to the left.

151
00:11:29,534 --> 00:11:31,700
I must apologise for the other night.

152
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:34,074
Afraid I was a bit...
Caught me at a bad moment.

153
00:11:34,242 --> 00:11:37,241
That's all right.
I'm just glad you managed to track me down.

154
00:11:37,409 --> 00:11:39,867
I hope you don't mind coming here.
It's Mum's favourite.

155
00:11:40,035 --> 00:11:42,535
No, no, it's... it's very nice.

156
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,535
Um, just...

157
00:11:49,495 --> 00:11:51,576
So, Philomena, how are you?

158
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:53,702
I'm all right.

159
00:11:55,162 --> 00:11:57,576
I had a hip replacement last year, Martin.

160
00:11:57,745 --> 00:11:58,827
Right.

161
00:11:58,994 --> 00:12:01,161
It's much better than the bone one I had before.

162
00:12:01,328 --> 00:12:03,912
And it's titanium, so it won't rust.

163
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,203
Oh. That's good, otherwise
they'd have to oil you like the Tin Man.

164
00:12:08,164 --> 00:12:09,369
Is that right?

165
00:12:09,538 --> 00:12:11,912
No, I mean, you know, like The Wizard Of Oz.

166
00:12:13,996 --> 00:12:17,622
- He's just joking, Mum.
- No, no, I'm just joking. No...

167
00:12:17,789 --> 00:12:21,455
My mother has advanced osteoarthritis
in both her knees.

168
00:12:21,623 --> 00:12:23,997
Oh. (Laughs)

169
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,039
- Shall we get some salad?
- Salad, yes.

170
00:12:30,206 --> 00:12:31,289
Yes.

171
00:12:34,457 --> 00:12:38,708
Jane's the clever one in our family.
She went to university as a mature student.

172
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,457
You know, when you're quite old.

173
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,458
Where did you go, Martin? Oxbridge, I bet.

174
00:12:43,626 --> 00:12:46,082
You've rumbled me. Oxford, yes.

175
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,624
I knew you weren't a duffer.

176
00:12:47,793 --> 00:12:51,000
- I don't think I've been in a Harvester before.
- Do they not have them in London?

177
00:12:51,168 --> 00:12:53,709
No, I tend to go to a little local place,
near where I live.

178
00:12:53,876 --> 00:12:55,751
- And where's that?
- Knightsbridge.

179
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:58,959
Oh. Well, that must be very expensive.

180
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:03,544
I love these little bits of toast on mine...

181
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:07,294
And are you married, Martin?

182
00:13:07,461 --> 00:13:11,336
- Yes, I am. To Kate. 20 years.
- That's good. That's grand.

183
00:13:13,504 --> 00:13:15,586
I did love him, you know.

184
00:13:19,254 --> 00:13:22,587
I've kept what happened to me
buried away for 50 years.

185
00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:28,004
My father just left me with the nuns,
he was so ashamed.

186
00:13:28,172 --> 00:13:30,171
He told everyone I was dead.

187
00:13:30,798 --> 00:13:32,797
My family never visited me.

188
00:13:34,798 --> 00:13:39,089
After you'd had your baby,
you had to stay in the abbey for four years.

189
00:13:39,257 --> 00:13:42,923
In order to repay the sisters for taking you in,
you had to work.

190
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:49,840
The worst jobs were in the laundry.
That's where they put me.

191
00:13:50,008 --> 00:13:53,507
I worked there seven days a week,
the whole time I was there.

192
00:13:53,676 --> 00:13:56,550
I worked there with my best friend, Kathleen.

193
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,427
We were allowed to see our children
for an hour a day.

194
00:14:11,594 --> 00:14:13,676
- Come on.
- That was all.

195
00:14:16,928 --> 00:14:19,010
Walk, don't run!

196
00:14:28,595 --> 00:14:30,428
- Mary!
- Mummy.

197
00:14:48,557 --> 00:14:51,722
Anthony was best friends
with Kathleen's daughter, Mary.

198
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,722
The two of them were inseparable.

199
00:14:57,598 --> 00:15:00,683
Look at that. He won't let her out of his sight.

200
00:15:03,392 --> 00:15:05,225
What's the matter?

201
00:15:05,392 --> 00:15:08,848
The girls in the kitchen said that Mother Barbara
had Mary up at the house.

202
00:15:09,017 --> 00:15:10,891
What do you think they wanted with her?

203
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:12,516
Phil.

204
00:15:12,685 --> 00:15:14,891
I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.

205
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:16,724
I won't be a minute.

206
00:15:19,935 --> 00:15:23,726
- Phil, I've got something for you.
- Kathleen's worried sick.

207
00:15:23,894 --> 00:15:28,019
She thinks they'll take Mary from her.
I told her they'd tell her first for sure.

208
00:15:28,187 --> 00:15:29,644
Look.

209
00:15:30,937 --> 00:15:33,019
You can't tell anyone you've got it.

210
00:15:35,478 --> 00:15:38,894
- I bet the father was handsome.
- He was. How did you get this?

211
00:15:39,062 --> 00:15:43,187
I borrowed a Box Brownie and took it
when Reverend Mother wasn't looking.

212
00:15:44,645 --> 00:15:46,395
Thank you.

213
00:15:50,104 --> 00:15:54,729
Whenever I look at that photo of Anthony,
I say a little prayer for Anunciata,

214
00:15:54,897 --> 00:15:57,396
who saved his life when I gave birth to him.

215
00:15:58,231 --> 00:16:00,397
She died a long time ago now...

216
00:16:00,565 --> 00:16:02,981
But if she hadn't taken that, I'd have nothing.

217
00:16:05,023 --> 00:16:08,565
So, were you just trapped there the whole time?

218
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:11,523
You could only leave if you paid them £100.

219
00:16:13,774 --> 00:16:16,190
But where would I get that kind of money?

220
00:16:18,608 --> 00:16:20,692
And where would I go?

221
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:27,108
I remember that day so clearly.

222
00:16:28,568 --> 00:16:31,316
We all knew what it meant
when a big car arrived.

223
00:16:33,027 --> 00:16:35,233
Kathleen was inconsolable.

224
00:16:35,401 --> 00:16:37,400
She knew this time they'd come for Mary.

225
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:39,610
No, no, no, no.

226
00:17:00,447 --> 00:17:02,529
(Low conversation)

227
00:17:07,738 --> 00:17:09,821
Come away from there!

228
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,656
What are you doing out here?

229
00:17:13,364 --> 00:17:15,906
I had a stomach ache, Sister Hildegarde.

230
00:17:16,614 --> 00:17:18,156
It's my time of the month.

231
00:17:18,324 --> 00:17:20,990
You're not unique in that regard.

232
00:17:21,157 --> 00:17:23,448
Put your mind to your work and it will pass.

233
00:17:32,783 --> 00:17:34,908
(Crying in background)

234
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,202
Phil, it's choir practice.

235
00:18:03,787 --> 00:18:05,536
You'll be in trouble if you don't go.

236
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,539
Normally, I loved to sing.

237
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:34,082
It was one of the only things
I enjoyed in that place.

238
00:18:35,997 --> 00:18:38,998
But all I could think about was poor Kathleen.

239
00:18:41,624 --> 00:18:43,541
(Door opens and closes)

240
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:55,583
- Philomena, they're taking Anthony.
- No, no.

241
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,417
- They're taking him away.
- No.

242
00:19:02,794 --> 00:19:04,585
- Where is he?
- (Baby crying)

243
00:19:17,462 --> 00:19:19,544
(Crying)

244
00:19:21,462 --> 00:19:25,545
Anthony!

245
00:19:38,256 --> 00:19:39,715
(Engine starts)

246
00:19:52,842 --> 00:20:13,383
Anthony!

247
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,844
They'd only come for Mary,
but Anthony wouldn't let her out of his sight.

248
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:27,303
They were inseparable.

249
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,219
I think what they did to you was evil.

250
00:20:29,386 --> 00:20:31,219
No, no, no, I don't like that word.

251
00:20:31,387 --> 00:20:33,346
No, no. Evil's good.

252
00:20:35,387 --> 00:20:37,472
Story-wise, I mean.

253
00:20:40,638 --> 00:20:43,054
Some of the nuns were very nice.

254
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:46,221
It was a breech birth.
They wouldn't even give her any painkillers.

255
00:20:46,387 --> 00:20:48,262
Excellent.

256
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,389
Again, story-wise.

257
00:20:51,265 --> 00:20:53,680
So, can we go and talk to these nuns?

258
00:20:53,848 --> 00:20:57,222
Uh, yes, well, you could try.
Maybe you'll have more luck than Mum's had.

259
00:20:57,391 --> 00:21:00,432
I've been several times over the years
to ask where he was.

260
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,224
And they're very helpful,
they're not like they used to be.

261
00:21:03,391 --> 00:21:05,307
They said they'd try and trace him for me.

262
00:21:05,475 --> 00:21:06,930
- But they haven't?
- No.

263
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:13,891
Can you help me find him, Martin?

264
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:16,350
Well, it's a very interesting story.

265
00:21:16,517 --> 00:21:19,058
I'm taking Mum to Ireland
for a few days next week.

266
00:21:19,226 --> 00:21:22,267
Why don't you come with us?
You could visit Roscrea with her.

267
00:21:22,435 --> 00:21:25,059
Yes, there's plenty of room.
It's a Vauxhall Cavalier.

268
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:30,059
Oh, no. I mean, thank you. But... I like to fly.

269
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:39,352
(Birdsong)

270
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:02,688
Hello. Sorry I'm late.

271
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,146
- Hello, Martin.
- Hi, Martin.

272
00:22:04,314 --> 00:22:06,146
I had a bit of trouble with the hire car.

273
00:22:06,314 --> 00:22:08,689
- Well, this is lovely, isn't it, Jane?
- There you go.

274
00:22:08,857 --> 00:22:11,564
I see why you wouldn't want to
squash up with us in the Cavalier.

275
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:14,565
No, no. It wasn't that. It was...
I just had a few things to do.

276
00:22:14,732 --> 00:22:17,481
- Sure you don't want me to come, Mum?
- You're not coming?

277
00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:20,648
No, I told Jane we'll be fine on our own,
just the two of us.

278
00:22:20,816 --> 00:22:23,524
- Isn't that right, Martin?
- Yeah. That's fine.

279
00:22:23,691 --> 00:22:26,942
I've put a few things in your bag.
I'll see you tonight.

280
00:22:28,026 --> 00:22:30,024
- Thanks, Martin.
- OK.

281
00:22:36,026 --> 00:22:37,609
(Starts engine)

282
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,611
- What kind of a car is this?
- A BMW.

283
00:22:46,777 --> 00:22:49,319
- That's German.
- Mm-hm.

284
00:22:49,487 --> 00:22:51,361
Would you like a Tune, Martin?

285
00:22:51,528 --> 00:22:53,611
If I hum it, will you play it?

286
00:22:53,778 --> 00:22:55,402
No, would you like a Tune?

287
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,444
Yes. I'm just...

288
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,277
Thanks.

289
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,152
Ooh.

290
00:23:05,446 --> 00:23:07,654
That's for good luck.

291
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:13,488
I've always thought that Saint Christopher
was a bit of a Mickey Mouse saint.

292
00:23:14,573 --> 00:23:16,322
I used to be an altar boy.

293
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,489
Do you believe in God, Martin?

294
00:23:18,657 --> 00:23:21,239
Well, where do you start?

295
00:23:22,824 --> 00:23:25,656
I've always thought
that was a very difficult question to...

296
00:23:25,824 --> 00:23:27,781
give a simple answer to.

297
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,615
- Do you?
- Yes.

298
00:23:34,616 --> 00:23:36,699
(Birdsong)

299
00:24:25,872 --> 00:24:28,205
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

300
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:32,664
(Buzzer)

301
00:24:33,707 --> 00:24:36,123
I'm one of the lucky ones, Martin.

302
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:39,665
Some of the mothers and babies
didn't even survive the childbirth.

303
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,623
Gosh.

304
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:45,249
- Can I help you?
- I'm Philomena Lee.

305
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:48,289
- I made an appointment.
- Yes. Come in, Philomena.

306
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:50,957
This is my friend Martin Sixsmith, News At Ten.

307
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:53,666
Well, it's BBC News, actually, but not any more.

308
00:24:53,834 --> 00:24:56,041
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

309
00:25:01,127 --> 00:25:03,584
- Sister Claire will be with you shortly.
- Thank you.

310
00:25:05,293 --> 00:25:06,667
May I use the bathroom?

311
00:25:06,836 --> 00:25:09,418
- It's downstairs on...
- I know where it is.

312
00:25:13,129 --> 00:25:14,503
Will I get you both some tea?

313
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,419
Yes, thank you.

314
00:26:15,384 --> 00:26:17,468
(Crying)

315
00:26:18,594 --> 00:26:36,511
Anthony!

316
00:26:38,012 --> 00:26:39,886
(Sobbing) Anthony!

317
00:26:41,512 --> 00:26:45,263
Anth... ony!

318
00:27:02,724 --> 00:27:03,764
(Door opens)

319
00:27:03,932 --> 00:27:06,056
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

320
00:27:06,808 --> 00:27:09,264
- I'm Sister Claire.
- Yes, hello.

321
00:27:09,432 --> 00:27:13,016
I was just admiring your picture
of Jayne Mansfield there.

322
00:27:13,182 --> 00:27:16,516
No, that's Jane Russell.
Jayne Mansfield was the blonde one.

323
00:27:16,684 --> 00:27:19,141
Yes, of course, yes.
But they were both very big.

324
00:27:19,308 --> 00:27:23,976
I mean the two of them, they were huge.
Their careers.

325
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:27,558
- Which one of them died in a car crash?
- Jayne Mansfield, yes.

326
00:27:27,726 --> 00:27:30,225
- Why is she on the wall?
- Sorry, I didn't catch your name.

327
00:27:30,394 --> 00:27:33,726
- Martin Sixsmith.
- Martin Sixsmith, News At Ten.

328
00:27:33,893 --> 00:27:36,227
Well, I was with the BBC, but not any more.

329
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,934
Hello, Philomena. Very nice to meet you.

330
00:27:40,102 --> 00:27:42,061
- I'm Sister Claire.
- Sister Claire.

331
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:45,144
Now, when was the last time
you came to see us, Philomena?

332
00:27:45,311 --> 00:27:47,478
It was well before your time, Sister Claire.

333
00:27:47,645 --> 00:27:51,521
I spoke to Sister Hildegarde on the telephone

334
00:27:51,687 --> 00:27:54,479
and when I came here
she wasn't well enough to see me.

335
00:27:54,647 --> 00:27:57,562
She's still with us, but she's very frail now.

336
00:27:58,313 --> 00:28:00,605
Oh, Martin, have some buttered brack.

337
00:28:00,772 --> 00:28:02,438
Wouldn't mind.

338
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:09,063
Mm. That's very nice.
It's like sort of pan dolce?

339
00:28:09,231 --> 00:28:12,688
- It is fruit bread, Martin.
- Yes. No, I know. It's lovely.

340
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:16,899
Well, now, I don't know if they told you last time,
Philomena,

341
00:28:17,065 --> 00:28:19,857
but most of our records
were destroyed in the big fire.

342
00:28:20,025 --> 00:28:21,773
- Oh?
- Fire?

343
00:28:21,941 --> 00:28:27,523
Well, it was before my time.
So I'm afraid I have no news of Anthony.

344
00:28:40,693 --> 00:28:42,692
I still go to Mass and...

345
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:48,985
...I don't want to cause any fuss
or point the finger at anybody,

346
00:28:49,153 --> 00:28:51,277
or blame the Church in any way.

347
00:28:53,028 --> 00:28:56,693
I only want to know if he's all right.
I don't even need to see him.

348
00:28:59,111 --> 00:29:05,236
I have visions of him and he's homeless
and nobody loves him.

349
00:29:06,321 --> 00:29:10,530
Philomena, we can't take away your pain,

350
00:29:12,446 --> 00:29:16,113
but we can walk through it with you,
hand in hand.

351
00:29:17,738 --> 00:29:19,071
Um...

352
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:22,571
These older nuns... Sorry to interrupt.

353
00:29:22,739 --> 00:29:25,739
These older nuns, perhaps they could help us
with some of the details?

354
00:29:25,907 --> 00:29:28,198
Most of them have passed away.

355
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:30,448
Right. What about the ones that haven't?

356
00:29:30,615 --> 00:29:33,241
I don't think you're going to get
much sense out of them.

357
00:29:33,408 --> 00:29:35,490
But can we try?

358
00:29:37,158 --> 00:29:39,157
I don't think that's going to be possible.

359
00:29:39,324 --> 00:29:41,240
Why not?

360
00:29:41,408 --> 00:29:44,575
I'm happy to answer any questions
Philomena has.

361
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:48,533
- Well, I'm asking you a question.
- You're a journalist.

362
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,617
Yes, I am. Well, I used to be.

363
00:29:50,785 --> 00:29:53,658
- Martin's a Roman Catholic.
- Yes... Well, no, I used to be.

364
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:57,825
I'd feel more comfortable
if I could speak to Philomena in private.

365
00:30:00,744 --> 00:30:02,909
(Distant choral singing)

366
00:30:10,662 --> 00:30:12,536
(Door shuts)

367
00:30:25,955 --> 00:30:27,871
Hello.

368
00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:29,372
Can I help?

369
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:32,664
- Oh, sorry. I was just...
- Are you looking for something?

370
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,204
What's down here?

371
00:30:34,372 --> 00:30:37,290
- Those are private quarters.
- Oh. OK.

372
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,831
I'll wait outside.

373
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:20,086
(Bell tolling)

374
00:31:22,921 --> 00:31:25,002
Sorry, I was just having a look round.

375
00:31:35,046 --> 00:31:37,255
What did she say to you?

376
00:31:37,423 --> 00:31:40,754
Oh, she said you were a journalist and that...

377
00:31:40,922 --> 00:31:45,962
you were trying to manipulate me
and that I should be careful what I say to you.

378
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,547
She also gave me this.

379
00:31:50,589 --> 00:31:53,048
- Do you want me to open it?
- Mm-hm.

380
00:31:57,966 --> 00:32:01,589
Well, it's a contract, signed by you in 1955.

381
00:32:02,258 --> 00:32:06,882
It says, "I hereby relinquish full claim
forever to my said child Anthony Lee.

382
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,257
I further undertake..."

383
00:32:08,425 --> 00:32:10,757
"...never to attempt to see, interfere with

384
00:32:10,925 --> 00:32:15,175
or make any claim to the said child
at any future time."

385
00:32:17,217 --> 00:32:19,092
I'll never find him.

386
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:23,426
If they coerced you in any way to sign this,
we can challenge them legally.

387
00:32:23,593 --> 00:32:26,010
Martin, no one coerced me.

388
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:28,218
I signed of my own free will.

389
00:32:33,845 --> 00:32:35,927
It's funny, isn't it?

390
00:32:36,095 --> 00:32:38,718
All the pieces of paper designed to...

391
00:32:38,886 --> 00:32:41,553
help you find him have been destroyed.

392
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,970
But guess what? The one piece
of paper designed to stop you finding him

393
00:32:45,138 --> 00:32:47,179
has been lovingly preserved.

394
00:32:47,346 --> 00:32:51,012
God in His infinite wisdom
decided to spare that from the flames.

395
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:56,305
I signed it because I believed I'd committed
a terrible sin and had to be punished.

396
00:32:57,597 --> 00:33:01,762
But what made it so much worse
was that I enjoyed it.

397
00:33:02,888 --> 00:33:04,972
- What?
- The sex.

398
00:33:05,723 --> 00:33:06,847
Oh...

399
00:33:07,015 --> 00:33:10,182
It was wonderful, Martin.
I thought I was floating on air.

400
00:33:11,473 --> 00:33:15,265
He was so handsome...
and the way he held me in his arms.

401
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,974
The thing is I didn't even know
I had a clitoris, Martin.

402
00:33:20,142 --> 00:33:21,724
Right?

403
00:33:21,892 --> 00:33:25,809
And after the sex was over, I thought
anything that feels so lovely must be wrong.

404
00:33:27,518 --> 00:33:29,391
Fucking Catholics.

405
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:33,767
Sorry.

406
00:33:33,934 --> 00:33:37,517
I spent 30 years as a nurse.
I've heard worse than that.

407
00:33:37,686 --> 00:33:43,561
It's just, why would God bestow upon us
a sexual desire that he then wants us to resist?

408
00:33:44,228 --> 00:33:49,937
Is it some weird game he's invented
to alleviate the boredom of being omnipotent?

409
00:33:50,104 --> 00:33:51,687
It baffles me.

410
00:33:51,853 --> 00:33:54,269
And I think I'm pretty clever.

411
00:33:54,438 --> 00:33:56,561
Well, maybe you're not.

412
00:33:59,979 --> 00:34:03,853
- How'd it go?
- What, from the Sisters of Little Mercy?

413
00:34:04,021 --> 00:34:06,104
Right, so just tea and cake, then?

414
00:34:08,064 --> 00:34:10,646
That's all they've ever given you, isn't it, Mum?

415
00:34:12,439 --> 00:34:14,355
It's not their fault, Jane.

416
00:34:14,523 --> 00:34:16,897
They had a fire and all the records were lost.

417
00:34:17,066 --> 00:34:19,480
- No, thank you. It's past your bedtime.
- Thank you.

418
00:34:19,648 --> 00:34:22,691
Now, he's just poured it now. Sláinte.

419
00:34:23,192 --> 00:34:24,856
Mother.

420
00:34:29,316 --> 00:34:32,273
- Right. Night, Martin.
- Night, Jane.

421
00:34:32,442 --> 00:34:35,774
- Night-night, Martin.
- Night, Philomena. Sleep well.

422
00:34:38,901 --> 00:34:40,317
Cheers.

423
00:34:40,484 --> 00:34:42,568
- Been up to the Abbey?
- Mm.

424
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,694
Yes. Yes, it's um...

425
00:34:45,444 --> 00:34:48,318
Things obviously very different now.
The nuns are different.

426
00:34:48,485 --> 00:34:51,108
Not the same ones they had
when the Magdalen girls were there.

427
00:34:51,276 --> 00:34:53,859
WOMAN: Sure. They're all gone now!

428
00:34:54,027 --> 00:34:58,069
We've had a few staying here, looking to find
what happened to their sons or daughters.

429
00:34:58,236 --> 00:34:59,986
Not many of them get any joy from there.

430
00:35:00,153 --> 00:35:03,487
And the big fire that destroyed everything.
Do you know how that started?

431
00:35:03,655 --> 00:35:06,611
- I should think they put a match to it.
- Who?

432
00:35:06,779 --> 00:35:09,986
The Sisters. Sure they had a great fire
on the field out the back.

433
00:35:10,154 --> 00:35:12,236
What, so the Abbey wasn't on fire?

434
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:16,113
They had a bloody big bonfire.
Burnt all the records. Thousands of 'em.

435
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,487
- Why? I mean...
- This is years ago.

436
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:21,655
I suppose they were embarrassed
about selling babies to America.

437
00:35:21,824 --> 00:35:23,822
And they don't want people telling tales.

438
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:27,572
- That's me mother.
- You say they sold babies to Americans?

439
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:30,614
A lot of the Yanks came over to Ireland
to look for babies.

440
00:35:30,782 --> 00:35:32,864
They were the only ones who could afford them.

441
00:35:33,032 --> 00:35:34,781
£1,000.

442
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:38,614
Jane Russell bought a baby from Derry in 1952 -
the film star.

443
00:35:38,783 --> 00:35:42,240
- I can't believe they sold babies.
- She came in here looking for Bourbon,

444
00:35:42,408 --> 00:35:45,240
but they had to give her
a glass of Paddy instead.

445
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:48,283
If you were a Catholic with £1,000,
you could buy a baby.

446
00:35:48,451 --> 00:35:51,532
Jane Russell bought one to take home with her.

447
00:35:51,701 --> 00:35:53,408
But I'm not one to repeat gossip.

448
00:35:53,576 --> 00:35:55,575
No, no, I can see that.

449
00:35:55,743 --> 00:35:58,617
- Sláinte.
- Yes, cheers.

450
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:18,785
MARTIN: Sally, you told me to call you if I came
up with something and this fell into my lap.

451
00:36:18,953 --> 00:36:21,703
- Go on.
- It's quite interesting, actually.

452
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:25,912
I think there are themes about people searching
for their family trees

453
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,080
and the whole Irish Diaspora...

454
00:36:29,247 --> 00:36:31,413
Don't use words like diaspora, Martin.

455
00:36:31,581 --> 00:36:33,872
I can't spell it
and people don't know what it means.

456
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:35,831
The exodus that followed the Irish famine.

457
00:36:35,998 --> 00:36:39,580
No, no, no.
I'm genuinely not interested in what it means.

458
00:36:39,747 --> 00:36:40,747
OK.

459
00:36:40,914 --> 00:36:43,039
Who are the goodies? Who are the baddies?

460
00:36:43,207 --> 00:36:46,331
Well, it's about a little old Irish lady,

461
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:51,290
a retired nurse, who is searching
for her long lost son who was taken -

462
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:55,748
snatched from her at birth - by... evil nuns.

463
00:36:56,999 --> 00:37:00,708
So how does it end?
And it's got to be really happy or really sad.

464
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:04,250
Either he's chairman of I BM or a hobo,
it doesn't matter.

465
00:37:04,418 --> 00:37:12,000
The years melted away as a 50-year silence
was broken by two simple words, "Hello, Mum."

466
00:37:12,168 --> 00:37:13,416
I could write it now.

467
00:37:15,668 --> 00:37:17,876
I didn't know you were so cynical.

468
00:37:18,044 --> 00:37:20,959
My guess is that Anthony was adopted
and sent to America.

469
00:37:21,127 --> 00:37:24,669
The Abbey dealt almost exclusively
with American customers.

470
00:37:24,837 --> 00:37:28,462
- I can't believe they sold babies.
- They were trying to give him a better life.

471
00:37:28,629 --> 00:37:31,128
- They tried to make money out of him!
- There's a problem.

472
00:37:31,297 --> 00:37:35,295
I got through to the Sacred Heart
Adoption Society in Cork this morning.

473
00:37:35,463 --> 00:37:38,169
They referred me to the Irish Adoption Board,

474
00:37:38,337 --> 00:37:40,837
who referred me back to
the Sacred Heart Adoption Society.

475
00:37:41,005 --> 00:37:42,838
- Around in circles!
- They won't help us.

476
00:37:43,005 --> 00:37:46,005
But I spoke to some contacts
from my Washington days last night,

477
00:37:46,173 --> 00:37:48,715
and there are avenues
we can pursue in America.

478
00:37:49,506 --> 00:37:53,755
The stumbling block is I can only get so far
speaking on your behalf, Philomena.

479
00:37:53,923 --> 00:37:58,798
But as his mother, they would be legally bound
to provide you with the information.

480
00:37:58,965 --> 00:38:01,423
Are you suggesting
you take my mother to America with you?

481
00:38:01,592 --> 00:38:05,505
If you want. My editor's agreed to foot the bill.

482
00:38:06,299 --> 00:38:08,840
How would you feel about
going to America with Martin?

483
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,424
Uh... I... I don't know.

484
00:38:11,591 --> 00:38:13,215
I could come with you if you like.

485
00:38:13,383 --> 00:38:15,507
No, no, no, you have your work.

486
00:38:15,675 --> 00:38:19,509
I'm worried that Martin will have to go
all that way with a daft old woman like me.

487
00:38:19,676 --> 00:38:21,800
- I don't think you're daft.
- Go away, would you?

488
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:24,051
Or old.

489
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:29,677
I think I would like to go.

490
00:38:31,801 --> 00:38:34,593
I'd like to know if Anthony ever thought of me...

491
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:39,260
...cos I've thought of him every day.

492
00:38:47,595 --> 00:38:49,345
Ooh, Washington. Lovely.

493
00:38:50,304 --> 00:38:53,887
- Did you pack your baggage yourself?
- Yes. My daughter helped me.

494
00:38:54,597 --> 00:38:57,973
I'm getting the royal treatment, Martin.
I feel like the Pope.

495
00:38:58,139 --> 00:38:59,221
(Chuckles)

496
00:38:59,388 --> 00:39:01,138
Well, it'll save your hip.

497
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:04,721
Is that an interesting book?
I've just finished mine.

498
00:39:04,888 --> 00:39:08,888
Uh... Yeah, no, mine's rather dull.
It's about the October Revolution.

499
00:39:09,057 --> 00:39:12,263
- Political horse-trading...
- Oh, mine's about horses.

500
00:39:12,432 --> 00:39:15,640
It's about this fellow, Robert,
and he's engaged to this duchess.

501
00:39:15,807 --> 00:39:18,974
And he's only the son of a doctor,
so he's done very well for himself.

502
00:39:19,141 --> 00:39:21,932
But this woman, this duchess, she's terrible.

503
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,390
She's as vain as you like,
and she's always looking at herself in the mirror

504
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:26,806
and all that sort of thing.

505
00:39:26,975 --> 00:39:29,474
Anyway, she thinks he's as dull as ditch-water

506
00:39:29,642 --> 00:39:33,391
so he takes up an interest in the horses
so he can get in with the upper classes.

507
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:36,266
And, of course,
he meets this girl down at the stables.

508
00:39:36,435 --> 00:39:38,559
And she's not even a doctor's daughter.

509
00:39:38,728 --> 00:39:42,017
Her father's a farmhand
and he only has the one foot.

510
00:39:42,184 --> 00:39:44,560
- Oh, dear.
- But of course they fall in love.

511
00:39:44,727 --> 00:39:46,810
And now he's torn between becoming a duke -

512
00:39:46,979 --> 00:39:50,603
if he marries the duchess,
he'll become lord of the manor and all that...

513
00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:52,769
- OK.
...and the stable girl who he loves,

514
00:39:52,937 --> 00:39:54,728
but she hasn't a penny to her name.

515
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:57,519
Well, the big day's coming,
the wedding, and this girl...

516
00:39:57,688 --> 00:40:02,644
This girl, she's lovely.
She says Robert has to do his duty.

517
00:40:02,812 --> 00:40:06,187
He's already spoken for.
And he's being measured for a suit.

518
00:40:06,355 --> 00:40:09,730
You can tell his heart's not in it
cos all the while he's thinking about

519
00:40:09,897 --> 00:40:11,605
the horses and the stable girl.

520
00:40:11,773 --> 00:40:15,106
So they're all waiting for him at the church,
all the hoi polloi,

521
00:40:15,273 --> 00:40:20,314
but the thing is, Martin, this duchess, she only
wants Robert to spite the fella she's really after.

522
00:40:20,482 --> 00:40:24,939
And then towards the end she finds out
that the stable girl has designs on Robert.

523
00:40:25,107 --> 00:40:30,564
But before that, the father with the one foot dies
and he says to Robert, "Follow your heart."

524
00:40:30,734 --> 00:40:34,190
The duchess gives the stable girl
her marching orders and she packs her things.

525
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:37,524
There's a pony and trap waiting outside
and she gets in, she says,

526
00:40:37,692 --> 00:40:39,066
"Do you know where we're going?"

527
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:42,149
And the driver turns round,
and if it isn't your man Robert!

528
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:45,651
And he says, "I'm taking you to a place
where no one can hurt you any more."

529
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,816
Well, I didn't see that coming, Martin,
not in a million years.

530
00:40:48,985 --> 00:40:50,609
It's nice when there's a surprise.

531
00:40:50,776 --> 00:40:53,192
- Sounds like a real page-turner.
- You can borrow it.

532
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,360
- That's OK.
- No, no. I've just finished it now.

533
00:40:55,526 --> 00:40:58,402
Well, I feel like I've almost read it.

534
00:41:00,153 --> 00:41:02,443
The Slipper And The Horse Shoe.

535
00:41:04,403 --> 00:41:06,236
Oh, there's a series of them.

536
00:41:06,403 --> 00:41:08,487
(Announcement in background)

537
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:12,654
Champagne or Buck's Fizz?

538
00:41:12,821 --> 00:41:15,278
- No, thank you.
- Oh. No, thank you.

539
00:41:16,654 --> 00:41:22,113
- It's free.
- Oh. I say! I'll have a Buck's Fizz.

540
00:41:26,406 --> 00:41:29,696
Thank you. This is lovely, Martin.

541
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:33,322
You have to pay for everything on Ryanair.

542
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:36,198
- Well, they don't have club class.
- Sláinte.

543
00:41:39,032 --> 00:41:40,157
Martin!

544
00:41:40,324 --> 00:41:42,532
- Alex, how are you?
- Not seen you since you...

545
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,490
left the department.
I was gonna call you, actually.

546
00:41:45,658 --> 00:41:47,324
- Still friends?
- Absolutely.

547
00:41:47,493 --> 00:41:49,406
I hope you didn't think I dropped you in it.

548
00:41:49,574 --> 00:41:51,241
Don't worry about it. The fog of war.

549
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:53,074
Yeah, collateral damage.

550
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,117
So, what are you up to?
Off to the primaries?

551
00:41:56,284 --> 00:41:57,991
- Yes, yes.
- No. He's helping me look...

552
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:02,159
I'm just... We're just here...
It's a human interest story. Journalism.

553
00:42:03,202 --> 00:42:05,660
Well, good luck with it.
Listen, I better scoot back.

554
00:42:05,828 --> 00:42:07,660
OK.

555
00:42:07,827 --> 00:42:10,659
I'm sorry, Martin.
Should we pretend we don't know each other?

556
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:13,494
No. No, no, no, it's...
It's just someone I used to work with.

557
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:16,076
A spin doctor. I'm trying to avoid them.

558
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:20,745
- Is that first class in there?
- It's just a perk of the job.

559
00:42:21,996 --> 00:42:26,119
Just cos you're in first class,
it doesn't make you a first-class person.

560
00:42:27,037 --> 00:42:29,121
He's all right.

561
00:42:30,996 --> 00:42:34,038
I think he needs a good swipe of shite.

562
00:42:37,122 --> 00:42:38,996
Yes, you're probably right.

563
00:43:17,377 --> 00:43:20,876
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Washington Dulles Airport.

564
00:43:39,462 --> 00:43:41,919
Martin, did you have
a little chocolate on your pillow?

565
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:43,837
Yes, I did, yes.

566
00:43:44,005 --> 00:43:45,712
- How the other half lives, eh?
- Yes.

567
00:43:45,881 --> 00:43:49,213
- Would you look at the view!
- Wow. Yeah.

568
00:43:49,381 --> 00:43:51,463
Mine's of an air conditioning duct.

569
00:43:52,173 --> 00:43:54,297
(Phone rings)

570
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,631
Ah. It's Caroline from the records office.
Better get this. Hello.

571
00:43:57,798 --> 00:43:59,755
Well, that's conjecture, guess work.

572
00:43:59,923 --> 00:44:03,297
Good guess work.
Send over the long list, then I can sort of...

573
00:44:03,465 --> 00:44:06,756
TV:
Martin Lawrence is going undercover.

574
00:44:06,924 --> 00:44:09,132
Great. Fabulous. I'll talk to you in the morning.

575
00:44:09,299 --> 00:44:11,132
OK. Bye-bye.

576
00:44:15,341 --> 00:44:17,215
Shall we go for a walk, get rid of the jet lag?

577
00:44:17,383 --> 00:44:19,550
You said you wanted
to visit the Lincoln Memorial?

578
00:44:19,717 --> 00:44:21,341
We could go and see Mr Lincoln.

579
00:44:21,509 --> 00:44:26,050
Or we could watch, on television,
Big Momma's House.

580
00:44:26,218 --> 00:44:29,424
It's about a little black man
pretending to be a fat black lady.

581
00:44:29,593 --> 00:44:32,176
They've just showed some of it on the television.

582
00:44:32,343 --> 00:44:35,134
And they're all chasing after him.

583
00:44:35,301 --> 00:44:37,550
It looked hilarious, Martin.

584
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:43,344
Isn't he wonderful?

585
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,262
I've always wanted to see him in his big chair.

586
00:44:46,429 --> 00:44:49,178
Well, he was a big man.

587
00:44:50,513 --> 00:44:53,802
Literally - six foot four.
Tallest American President.

588
00:44:53,971 --> 00:44:57,178
Well, you can see that.
He's tall even sitting down.

589
00:44:58,055 --> 00:45:02,178
I had a friend whose daughter paid for her
to go to Florida for her 70th birthday.

590
00:45:02,347 --> 00:45:06,180
She said to me, "Phil, the size of the portions,
you wouldn't believe."

591
00:45:06,348 --> 00:45:09,014
If you just go...
Let's just take a quick picture, see.

592
00:45:09,181 --> 00:45:10,429
You go stand by the line.

593
00:45:10,597 --> 00:45:12,846
- Is this for the article?
- It is. Just go back further.

594
00:45:13,015 --> 00:45:15,265
Only I'm a little bit worried,
because if we find him,

595
00:45:15,432 --> 00:45:18,306
he might be very disapproving
of talking to the papers.

596
00:45:18,474 --> 00:45:19,724
Families are private things.

597
00:45:19,892 --> 00:45:22,599
I know. Go and stand back there.
That's true, they are private,

598
00:45:22,768 --> 00:45:27,765
but tracking him down's an expensive business,
and so it's sort of like a quid pro quo, isn't it?

599
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:31,682
- What does that mean?
- Well, it literally means this for that.

600
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:35,307
Don't worry. I won't write anything
you're unhappy with. I want to tell the truth.

601
00:45:35,475 --> 00:45:37,934
Yes. That's the thing I'm worried about.

602
00:45:38,101 --> 00:45:40,350
Should I smile or should I be serious?

603
00:45:40,518 --> 00:45:44,643
Erm... Let's do one happy, one not so happy.

604
00:45:50,728 --> 00:45:54,310
I'm getting scared, now we're getting closer.

605
00:45:54,895 --> 00:45:58,685
All these years, wondering whether Anthony
was in trouble or in... prison,

606
00:45:58,853 --> 00:46:00,478
or goodness knows where.

607
00:46:00,979 --> 00:46:04,354
As long as I didn't know, I could
always tell myself he was happy somewhere

608
00:46:04,522 --> 00:46:06,853
and that he was doing all right.

609
00:46:07,021 --> 00:46:09,186
But what if he died in Vietnam?

610
00:46:09,355 --> 00:46:12,062
Or came back with no legs,
or lived on the street...

611
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:17,689
Don't upset yourself. Hm?

612
00:46:17,856 --> 00:46:21,105
We don't know what we don't know.
We'll deal with that when we get to it.

613
00:46:21,273 --> 00:46:23,355
Well, what if he was a drug addict, Martin?

614
00:46:24,897 --> 00:46:26,647
Or what if he was obese?

615
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,981
Obese?

616
00:46:30,149 --> 00:46:33,607
I watched this documentary
that says a lot of Americans are huge.

617
00:46:34,399 --> 00:46:36,483
What if that's happened to him?

618
00:46:37,234 --> 00:46:38,857
What on earth makes you think he'd be obese?

619
00:46:39,026 --> 00:46:41,774
Because of the size of the portions.

620
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:43,566
(TV on)

621
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:45,817
(Phone rings)

622
00:46:49,401 --> 00:46:51,275
Hello?

623
00:46:52,027 --> 00:46:54,066
No, I've got a bathrobe, Philomena.

624
00:46:55,610 --> 00:47:00,817
Yes, there are two in every room. And slippers.

625
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:05,110
OK, you've just got a bit of jet lag.
Just try and get your head down.

626
00:47:06,404 --> 00:47:08,403
All right, night-night.

627
00:47:09,155 --> 00:47:10,986
- How is everyone?
KATE: Yeah. We're good.

628
00:47:11,155 --> 00:47:13,653
Danny won his rugby match today,
nearly scored a try.

629
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:15,653
- That's fantastic.
- How's Philomena?

630
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:20,861
Well, I've finally seen, first hand,
what a lifetime's diet of the Reader's Digest,

631
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:24,696
the Daily Mail and romantic fiction
can do to a person's brain.

632
00:47:24,863 --> 00:47:25,779
(Laughs)

633
00:47:25,946 --> 00:47:28,571
She keeps telling the hotel staff
how kind they are.

634
00:47:28,739 --> 00:47:30,614
She must think they're volunteers.

635
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:33,406
She told four people today
they were one in a million.

636
00:47:34,198 --> 00:47:35,532
What are the chances of that?

637
00:47:35,783 --> 00:47:38,656
Come on, she's just a little old Irish lady.

638
00:47:41,198 --> 00:47:43,031
(Knock at door)

639
00:47:46,616 --> 00:47:48,615
(Knocking continues)

640
00:47:55,116 --> 00:47:57,116
(Clears his throat)

641
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:00,699
Hi. Is everything all right?

642
00:48:00,867 --> 00:48:05,701
Martin, I just wanted to tell you something earlier
but it slipped my mind.

643
00:48:06,327 --> 00:48:10,243
And then I thought I'd tell you on the phone
but I forgot the number.

644
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:11,743
OK.

645
00:48:12,452 --> 00:48:16,576
Well, what I want to say, Martin,
is thank you for helping me look for my son.

646
00:48:16,744 --> 00:48:17,826
Oh...

647
00:48:17,993 --> 00:48:20,076
I know you got the sack from your job...

648
00:48:20,244 --> 00:48:22,744
I mean, not the News At Ten one,
but that other one.

649
00:48:23,495 --> 00:48:25,577
Well, their loss is my gain.

650
00:48:27,953 --> 00:48:29,578
Thank you.

651
00:48:29,746 --> 00:48:32,703
- Well, good night, Martin.
- Good night, Philomena.

652
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:14,374
(Panting)

653
00:49:18,669 --> 00:49:21,833
Hello, Caroline, it's Martin Sixsmith.

654
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:26,501
I just wanted to check...
Yeah, the file with the immigration cuttings?

655
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,252
I know you checked it.
Could you send that through?

656
00:49:30,419 --> 00:49:32,918
We don't really have Mexicans in England.

657
00:49:33,085 --> 00:49:36,334
We have Indians instead,
and everyone loves curry.

658
00:49:37,753 --> 00:49:42,379
Martin. Martin. They've got omelettes over there.

659
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:45,169
- Thank you.
- Pancakes, and waffles, any filling.

660
00:49:45,336 --> 00:49:47,046
- Cereal, bacon and sausage.
- I know.

661
00:49:47,212 --> 00:49:48,545
- Anything you want.
- I saw. I saw.

662
00:49:48,713 --> 00:49:50,587
- Breakfast is included, isn't it?
- It is.

663
00:49:50,755 --> 00:49:53,588
It's just it's too early for me.
My stomach hasn't woken up yet.

664
00:49:53,755 --> 00:49:57,547
Mine wakes up before I do.
I'm having a ham and Swiss cheese omelette.

665
00:49:57,714 --> 00:50:00,463
- Will I get you one?
- No, I... I'm not hungry.

666
00:50:00,631 --> 00:50:02,298
- What about blueberries?
- Coffee?

667
00:50:02,464 --> 00:50:03,547
No, thank you.

668
00:50:03,714 --> 00:50:07,255
If you want to help yourself to breakfast,
we have two buffets, hot and cold.

669
00:50:07,423 --> 00:50:09,548
- I know. She's just told me.
- Fresh fruit, cereal,

670
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,423
omelettes with your choice of filling.

671
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:13,840
- I know what's on display.
- We also have pancakes.

672
00:50:14,008 --> 00:50:16,424
Thank you.
Trying to have a private conversation.

673
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,507
My apologies, sir.

674
00:50:21,591 --> 00:50:24,549
There's no need to be rude.
She's a very nice person.

675
00:50:24,717 --> 00:50:27,841
I know. I'm sure she's one in a million,
or one in a hundred thousand.

676
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:30,675
- What do you mean?
- You've said it to about ten people,

677
00:50:30,842 --> 00:50:32,592
so that's just maths.

678
00:50:32,759 --> 00:50:34,592
You should be nice to the people on the way up

679
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,676
cos you might meet them again
on the way down.

680
00:50:36,843 --> 00:50:39,884
Now, you of all people should understand that.

681
00:50:40,802 --> 00:50:43,635
I'd rather you were rude to me
than the nice people who work here.

682
00:50:43,803 --> 00:50:46,385
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to help you find your son.

683
00:50:46,553 --> 00:50:48,719
That's why we're here. So...

684
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:52,555
Can I have some quiet time?

685
00:51:02,013 --> 00:51:04,930
- Were you born in Mexico?
- I'm from Chihuahua.

686
00:51:05,096 --> 00:51:09,056
You must like nachos.
My granddaughter Natalie got me into them.

687
00:51:10,056 --> 00:51:14,597
I've never been to Mexico, but I believe
it's lovely, apart from the kidnappings.

688
00:51:15,307 --> 00:51:16,431
(Gasps) Oh!

689
00:51:16,597 --> 00:51:18,596
(Chuckles)

690
00:51:19,557 --> 00:51:21,181
(Message alert)

691
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:38,099
Oh. Er...

692
00:52:47,817 --> 00:52:49,856
- There you go.
PHILOMENA: Thank you.

693
00:52:53,233 --> 00:52:56,525
They've run out of blueberries
so I got you raspberries instead.

694
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:00,152
I'm sorry. Is it a quiet time?

695
00:53:10,652 --> 00:53:12,734
That's my Anthony.

696
00:53:20,362 --> 00:53:22,028
He's dead, isn't he?

697
00:53:22,196 --> 00:53:24,278
Yes. I'm sorry.

698
00:53:25,696 --> 00:53:27,445
(Sobs)

699
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:32,030
No.

700
00:53:33,573 --> 00:53:35,572
I'm sorry.

701
00:53:36,281 --> 00:53:38,280
I'm so sorry.

702
00:53:58,742 --> 00:54:00,741
(Whooping and laughter)

703
00:54:17,244 --> 00:54:18,702
- He's dead.
- Who's dead?

704
00:54:18,869 --> 00:54:21,202
The son. He died eight years ago.

705
00:54:21,369 --> 00:54:24,535
Oh, dear. And what did he die of?

706
00:54:24,703 --> 00:54:26,285
I don't know. I didn't find out.

707
00:54:26,454 --> 00:54:28,536
- I'm at the airport.
- You're at the airport?

708
00:54:28,705 --> 00:54:31,495
Well, she just wants to get back,
be with her daughter.

709
00:54:31,662 --> 00:54:34,787
- What about the story?
- Well, he's dead.

710
00:54:34,954 --> 00:54:37,245
Dead or alive, happy or sad.

711
00:54:37,413 --> 00:54:40,619
They're both good. Spin it. Find a story.

712
00:54:40,787 --> 00:54:45,121
Look, if I stay here and she goes home,
no one's going to answer my questions.

713
00:54:45,288 --> 00:54:46,871
Then keep her there.

714
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,330
What?

715
00:54:48,497 --> 00:54:51,747
Come on, she's in bits.
It's like she's lost him all over again.

716
00:54:51,915 --> 00:54:53,789
That's great. Write that line down.

717
00:55:09,584 --> 00:55:12,040
- You signed a contract.
- You serious?

718
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:14,542
Yes. Call me when you've got something.

719
00:55:19,835 --> 00:55:21,834
(Sighs)

720
00:55:25,711 --> 00:55:27,710
Sorry, that was my editor.

721
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:31,960
I suppose you'll have to use
the not-so-happy-photo now?

722
00:55:33,836 --> 00:55:35,876
Yes. I suppose so.

723
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:44,837
I remember that day at the fair.

724
00:55:45,003 --> 00:55:48,088
His father made me laugh
by pretending to be an old man.

725
00:55:49,088 --> 00:55:51,754
And I made him laugh
by pretending to be an old woman.

726
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:56,628
And now I am one.

727
00:55:56,796 --> 00:56:00,463
I'll never know if Anthony
ever even thought about me.

728
00:56:01,464 --> 00:56:03,755
And I'll never be able to say sorry.

729
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:12,715
We start boarding in about an hour.

730
00:56:16,007 --> 00:56:19,298
Tell me, Martin,
do we have what they call flexible tickets?

731
00:56:20,383 --> 00:56:21,425
Yes, I think so.

732
00:56:21,592 --> 00:56:24,257
Where you can change your flight
if you change your plans?

733
00:56:24,425 --> 00:56:25,756
Yes, but...

734
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:28,424
Supposing we didn't get on
the aeroplane tonight?

735
00:56:30,592 --> 00:56:34,800
Because I've been sitting here waiting for a sign,
and I haven't had one.

736
00:56:34,968 --> 00:56:38,634
And so I've made the decision myself
and I'd like to stay a little longer.

737
00:56:40,177 --> 00:56:42,718
Well, if that's what you want to do?

738
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,802
It is.

739
00:56:46,885 --> 00:56:50,010
I'd like to talk to someone who actually met him.

740
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:53,844
All right, then we'll stay.

741
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:56,970
(TV on)

742
00:57:00,805 --> 00:57:03,262
I've been sent a picture of Anthony,
if you want to see it.

743
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:05,096
Oh.

744
00:57:05,262 --> 00:57:07,804
- Yes, please.
- With President Reagan.

745
00:57:10,722 --> 00:57:12,929
It's from a woman we could meet tomorrow...

746
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,306
...called Marcia Weller.

747
00:57:16,681 --> 00:57:20,180
- She's an ex-colleague of Anthony's.
- He looks very smart.

748
00:57:20,973 --> 00:57:24,055
Now, would you like a drink? Brandy, isn't it?

749
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:26,097
They're all gone.

750
00:57:27,015 --> 00:57:31,599
Martin. This man looks just like you.

751
00:57:44,767 --> 00:57:46,640
It is me.

752
00:57:48,352 --> 00:57:50,433
Michael Hess.

753
00:57:51,643 --> 00:57:52,976
- I met him.
- Where?

754
00:57:53,143 --> 00:57:54,726
- At the White House.
- Dear God!

755
00:57:54,894 --> 00:57:56,976
About ten years ago when I was with the BBC.

756
00:57:57,144 --> 00:57:59,060
- What was he like?
- I can't remember.

757
00:57:59,228 --> 00:58:02,602
- It was a Republican thing.
- You must remember something.

758
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:05,310
He was by the door when we went...
I shook hands with him.

759
00:58:05,478 --> 00:58:08,019
Well, what kind of a handshake did he have?

760
00:58:08,438 --> 00:58:11,519
It was firm. I mean, I would remember
if he'd had a weak handshake.

761
00:58:11,687 --> 00:58:14,104
You don't get to that position
with a weak handshake.

762
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:16,061
So he had a firm handshake, what else?

763
00:58:17,104 --> 00:58:19,603
- He was smart.
- I always kept him smart.

764
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:22,479
And did you remember anything he said?

765
00:58:24,106 --> 00:58:25,813
- "Hello."
- "Hello. Hello."

766
00:58:25,981 --> 00:58:27,062
Might've been "hi".

767
00:58:27,231 --> 00:58:28,730
- "Hello."
- He was polite.

768
00:58:28,897 --> 00:58:32,898
Well... Now, well, he was smart,
and he had a firm handshake.

769
00:58:33,066 --> 00:58:35,815
- He said hello, which was nice.
- He said hello. Hello.

770
00:58:36,441 --> 00:58:38,897
- He was polite.
- Oh, Martin!

771
00:58:45,691 --> 00:58:49,649
I... knew your son for about ten years.

772
00:58:51,524 --> 00:58:56,399
He was senior legal counsel
to both the Reagan and Bush administrations.

773
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:59,567
He didn't do too badly, did he, Philomena?

774
00:59:01,943 --> 00:59:04,776
He'd never have got a job like that
if he'd stayed with me.

775
00:59:06,612 --> 00:59:08,693
I think he'd have worked at McEverleys.

776
00:59:09,486 --> 00:59:11,818
That's a firm of solicitors in Castlebar.

777
00:59:13,526 --> 00:59:15,776
Did he ever mention Ireland, Marcia?

778
00:59:15,945 --> 00:59:17,901
I don't think so.

779
00:59:18,069 --> 00:59:20,319
Although I do have a number for his sister, Mary,

780
00:59:20,487 --> 00:59:22,487
- who came over from Ireland with him.
- Great.

781
00:59:22,654 --> 00:59:25,028
- I can put you in touch.
- Great, that's excellent.

782
00:59:25,197 --> 00:59:27,196
He looks very happy here.

783
00:59:29,363 --> 00:59:30,903
Who's this fella?

784
00:59:31,739 --> 00:59:34,320
That's his friend Pete.

785
00:59:37,988 --> 00:59:42,696
- And were you his girlfriend, Marcia?
- Oh... (Chuckles) No.

786
00:59:44,448 --> 00:59:46,948
I don't know if you knew, but he was gay.

787
00:59:48,241 --> 00:59:51,614
I used to accompany him
when he'd go to official functions

788
00:59:51,781 --> 00:59:55,198
because being gay was frowned on
in the Republican Party.

789
00:59:59,907 --> 01:00:02,699
But he was very charming and charismatic.

790
01:00:04,075 --> 01:00:06,867
Tell me, did he father any children?

791
01:00:07,034 --> 01:00:10,157
Philomena, Marcia's just told us
that Anthony was gay.

792
01:00:10,325 --> 01:00:14,157
Well, I always knew that.
But I just wondered if he might be bi-curious.

793
01:00:14,326 --> 01:00:16,743
- Bi-curious?
- A lot of nurses I worked with were gay

794
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:20,410
but one of them called Brendan
told me he was bi-curious.

795
01:00:20,578 --> 01:00:23,577
I don't think he could make up his mind, Marcia.

796
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:26,577
He didn't have any children. I'm sorry.

797
01:00:29,995 --> 01:00:31,826
Did Pete love him?

798
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:33,827
Yes, he did.

799
01:00:34,704 --> 01:00:37,871
Phil, how did you know he was gay?

800
01:00:38,161 --> 01:00:40,786
Well, he was a very sensitive little boy.

801
01:00:40,954 --> 01:00:45,121
And as the years rolled on,
I always wondered whether he might be.

802
01:00:45,829 --> 01:00:50,412
When I saw the photograph of him in
the dungarees, there was no doubt in my mind.

803
01:01:07,207 --> 01:01:09,248
(Dog barking)

804
01:01:13,916 --> 01:01:15,416
Peter, what do you think?

805
01:01:15,584 --> 01:01:18,541
I think she's in a bad mood.
She's kind of got crabby today, huh?

806
01:01:18,709 --> 01:01:19,791
Unlike you.

807
01:01:26,043 --> 01:01:28,666
Why did you keep this a secret for 50 years?

808
01:01:29,584 --> 01:01:33,542
What I'd done was a sin
and I kept it all hidden away.

809
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:38,252
And then I thought to myself
that keeping it all hidden away

810
01:01:38,419 --> 01:01:41,126
was also a sin because I was lying to everybody.

811
01:01:43,629 --> 01:01:46,543
And as it went on I tied myself up in knots,

812
01:01:46,711 --> 01:01:51,545
worrying which was the worse sin of the two,
having the baby or the lying.

813
01:01:52,046 --> 01:01:55,045
Well, in the end,
I couldn't make up my mind, Martin.

814
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:59,962
I was going to ask you, Martin,
if it'd be possible not to use my real name

815
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:01,712
when you write the story?

816
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,713
Perhaps you could call me Nancy?
I've always loved that name, Nancy.

817
01:02:05,881 --> 01:02:07,754
I have a niece called Nancy.

818
01:02:07,922 --> 01:02:09,714
Oh, no, maybe they'd think it's her.

819
01:02:10,008 --> 01:02:13,672
- What about Anne? Anne Boleyn?
- Anne Boleyn?

820
01:02:13,841 --> 01:02:15,757
That's a lovely name. Somebody had that...

821
01:02:15,924 --> 01:02:19,840
We'll have to use your real name, Philomena.
That's the way these things work.

822
01:02:31,592 --> 01:02:33,174
- Mary?
- Yes.

823
01:02:33,342 --> 01:02:37,633
Hello, it's Martin. This is Philomena Lee.
Anthony's mother.

824
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,885
Well, Michael's mother.

825
01:02:42,593 --> 01:02:44,467
OK.

826
01:02:45,552 --> 01:02:47,094
That's our mother.

827
01:02:47,261 --> 01:02:49,343
I mean, our adoptive mother.

828
01:02:50,551 --> 01:02:53,136
Was she a nice lady, Mary?
She looks a nice lady.

829
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:57,593
You know, I'm not gonna lie to you.
We didn't have the happiest childhood.

830
01:02:57,762 --> 01:03:01,970
Marge was OK, but our father, Doc,
he could be a very hard man.

831
01:03:02,138 --> 01:03:03,638
(Children shouting)

832
01:03:05,303 --> 01:03:07,388
Stop torturing her!

833
01:03:08,847 --> 01:03:11,346
And that's him with Pete Olsson.

834
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:15,012
Mike and Pete were...

835
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:19,138
That's all right, Mary.
I know Anthony was a gay homosexual.

836
01:03:19,931 --> 01:03:24,139
And we met Marcia, who I believe
was his beard. Is that right, Martin?

837
01:03:24,306 --> 01:03:25,973
Yes, that's about right.

838
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:30,930
It must have been terrible,
having to keep it a secret his whole life.

839
01:03:33,098 --> 01:03:35,766
- I assume my son died from AIDS.
- Yes.

840
01:03:36,724 --> 01:03:40,975
He wasn't too happy the last couple of years
of his life working for Reagan.

841
01:03:41,142 --> 01:03:42,725
He was pretty messed up about it.

842
01:03:42,893 --> 01:03:45,057
The Republicans withdrew funding
for AIDS research

843
01:03:45,225 --> 01:03:48,308
because they blamed the epidemic
on gay lifestyles.

844
01:03:48,474 --> 01:03:53,183
Right, because some of them wouldn't wear
condoms because they said it spoilt the feeling.

845
01:03:56,769 --> 01:03:58,559
Where is he buried, Mary?

846
01:03:58,727 --> 01:04:02,894
Dad wanted him buried in the family plot
in St Louis, but Pete wouldn't allow it.

847
01:04:03,061 --> 01:04:05,269
There was a huge fight.

848
01:04:05,437 --> 01:04:08,852
I didn't go in the end.
I didn't want to get involved.

849
01:04:09,021 --> 01:04:12,519
- You can talk to Pete about it.
- Yes, we have Pete's number.

850
01:04:12,686 --> 01:04:15,603
I think we're going to pay him a visit,
aren't we, Philomena?

851
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:20,645
Mm...

852
01:04:21,105 --> 01:04:24,937
Can I just ask you one thing, Mary?
There's something I need to know.

853
01:04:25,105 --> 01:04:28,979
Did Anthony ever mention Ireland,
or where he'd come from?

854
01:04:32,689 --> 01:04:36,106
Not really, no. We didn't really talk about that.

855
01:04:37,649 --> 01:04:39,730
No. Why would you?

856
01:04:44,149 --> 01:04:47,482
- Do you want some sugar, or some milk?
- If you wouldn't mind.

857
01:04:47,649 --> 01:04:49,732
Thank you very much for your hospitality.

858
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,399
(Children's voices)

859
01:05:08,484 --> 01:05:12,443
It seems odd that she was in the same room
as someone who knew her mother,

860
01:05:12,611 --> 01:05:14,651
and yet she asked you no questions about her.

861
01:05:15,819 --> 01:05:17,193
I don't think it's odd.

862
01:05:17,361 --> 01:05:20,609
She'd just be asking questions
about someone she didn't know.

863
01:05:24,862 --> 01:05:27,820
I'd like to go to confession.
We passed a church on the way here.

864
01:05:28,362 --> 01:05:30,904
Why do you want to go to confession?

865
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:32,695
To confess my sins, of course.

866
01:05:32,863 --> 01:05:35,195
What sins?

867
01:05:35,362 --> 01:05:38,238
The Catholic Church should go to confession,
not you.

868
01:05:38,404 --> 01:05:40,069
"Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

869
01:05:40,238 --> 01:05:42,779
I incarcerated a load of young women
against their will,

870
01:05:42,946 --> 01:05:46,071
used them as slave labour,
then sold their babies to the highest bidder."

871
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,656
I hope God isn't listening to you.

872
01:05:47,823 --> 01:05:50,697
Well, I don't believe in God.
So, look, no thunderbolt.

873
01:05:50,866 --> 01:05:52,240
What are you trying to prove?

874
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:55,866
Nothing, just that you don't need religion
to lead a happy and balanced life.

875
01:05:56,034 --> 01:05:57,865
And you're happy and balanced, are you?

876
01:05:58,033 --> 01:06:00,490
I'm a journalist, Philomena. We ask questions.

877
01:06:00,658 --> 01:06:03,614
We don't believe something
just because we're told it's the truth.

878
01:06:03,783 --> 01:06:07,448
Yet what does the Bible say?
"Happy are those who do not see yet believe."

879
01:06:07,617 --> 01:06:09,449
Hooray for blind faith and ignorance.

880
01:06:09,617 --> 01:06:13,450
And what do you believe in? Picking holes
in everyone else and being a smart aleck?

881
01:06:14,202 --> 01:06:15,865
Taking photos whenever you like?

882
01:06:18,535 --> 01:06:21,618
I read a very funny headline
in a satirical newspaper the other day,

883
01:06:21,786 --> 01:06:23,117
about the earthquake in Turkey.

884
01:06:23,287 --> 01:06:25,825
It said, "God outdoes terrorists yet again."

885
01:06:25,995 --> 01:06:27,868
Why God feels the need to suddenly wipe out

886
01:06:28,037 --> 01:06:30,326
hundreds of thousands
of innocent people escapes me.

887
01:06:30,495 --> 01:06:32,619
You should ask Him about that
while you're in there.

888
01:06:32,787 --> 01:06:34,701
He'll probably say He moves in mysterious ways.

889
01:06:34,869 --> 01:06:37,911
No, I think He'd say you we're a feckin' eejit.

890
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,746
Hello.

891
01:06:57,038 --> 01:06:58,412
Hello?

892
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,538
- Oh, hello.
- Hi, Sally.

893
01:07:00,705 --> 01:07:02,039
- What have you got?
- Guess what.

894
01:07:02,206 --> 01:07:05,830
He was a big-shot lawyer for both
the Reagan and Bush administrations.

895
01:07:05,998 --> 01:07:07,790
You're kidding. That's amazing!

896
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:12,165
And at the same time he was
a closet homosexual who died of AIDS.

897
01:07:12,832 --> 01:07:15,916
Oh... This is perfect for the weekend section.

898
01:07:16,082 --> 01:07:17,957
And... I met him.

899
01:07:18,125 --> 01:07:19,541
- You knew him?
- Yeah.

900
01:07:19,708 --> 01:07:23,333
- So there's a personal angle?
- Yeah, that's one of the angles.

901
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:26,875
But people need to know what happened to him.
There's a real injustice here.

902
01:07:27,042 --> 01:07:29,499
What about the evil nuns?
What's happening with them?

903
01:07:29,667 --> 01:07:33,209
Still there. They haven't gone away.
If anything, they're a bit more evil.

904
01:07:33,918 --> 01:07:35,251
It's great, Martin.

905
01:07:35,419 --> 01:07:37,252
I'll call you back in a bit.

906
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:40,168
Speak up now, dear. Don't be afraid.

907
01:07:45,379 --> 01:07:47,377
(Sobs)

908
01:08:03,256 --> 01:08:07,712
Have faith, my dear. God will forgive you.

909
01:08:51,468 --> 01:08:55,468
Phil? Phil, you were right.
I was being a feckin' eejit.

910
01:08:55,635 --> 01:08:58,177
- And I'm sorry...
- I was doing some thinking in there.

911
01:08:58,344 --> 01:09:01,678
I'm going to get a loan
from the Bradford and Bigley, Martin.

912
01:09:01,844 --> 01:09:03,803
- Bingley.
- Because I don't have a mortgage.

913
01:09:03,970 --> 01:09:06,470
And you can get an extension for £10,000.

914
01:09:06,637 --> 01:09:10,179
My friend Rene did that.
She had a conservatory built.

915
01:09:10,346 --> 01:09:12,220
Well, I don't need a conservatory.

916
01:09:12,388 --> 01:09:14,805
So I can give you all the money and then...

917
01:09:15,681 --> 01:09:19,512
And then that'll cover the costs of the hotels

918
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:22,512
and all the flights and everything
and you won't be out-of-pocket,

919
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:25,264
and you won't publish the story
cos I don't want it published.

920
01:09:25,431 --> 01:09:27,389
I don't want anyone to know about this, ever.

921
01:09:27,557 --> 01:09:32,182
Phil, you've done nothing wrong.
You're entitled to know who your son was.

922
01:09:32,349 --> 01:09:34,265
Well, you heard what Mary said.

923
01:09:34,433 --> 01:09:36,265
She said he never gave me a second thought.

924
01:09:36,433 --> 01:09:39,140
He wasn't my Anthony,
he was somebody else's Michael.

925
01:09:39,307 --> 01:09:42,182
- He probably hated the thought of me.
- You don't know that.

926
01:09:42,348 --> 01:09:44,223
I should never have let him out of my sight.

927
01:09:44,391 --> 01:09:47,140
We just need to talk to Pete Olsson.

928
01:09:54,436 --> 01:09:56,224
- (Ringing tone)
- Can I help you?

929
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:58,934
Hello. I'm trying to set up a meeting
with Pete Olsson.

930
01:09:59,101 --> 01:10:02,392
- I believe you've called before, sir.
- Yes. I've called a couple of times

931
01:10:02,561 --> 01:10:03,726
and no one's calling me back.

932
01:10:03,895 --> 01:10:06,018
I feel like I'm hitting my head against a brick wall.

933
01:10:06,186 --> 01:10:08,975
We have explained
Mr Olsson is too busy to deal with this matter.

934
01:10:09,144 --> 01:10:11,226
- Yes, yes.
- So, I am unable to put you through...

935
01:10:11,395 --> 01:10:15,435
Right, but I think if you give me his personal
number, I think he'll be OK with that, I do.

936
01:10:15,602 --> 01:10:17,602
- I can't give out personal numbers.
- I know.

937
01:10:17,771 --> 01:10:21,603
But I don't understand why he won't meet
with Philomena for just an hour.

938
01:10:21,771 --> 01:10:23,645
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- I mean, it's not a...

939
01:10:23,813 --> 01:10:25,813
(Hangs up)

940
01:10:41,856 --> 01:10:44,481
Philomena? You all right?

941
01:10:50,024 --> 01:10:52,107
(Ringing tone)

942
01:10:54,774 --> 01:10:57,274
I'm sorry, sir, there's no answer.

943
01:10:57,441 --> 01:11:00,816
Well, she wouldn't have gone
anywhere by herself.

944
01:11:01,818 --> 01:11:05,692
It's probably nothing, but she's very old and Irish.

945
01:11:05,859 --> 01:11:08,732
And she's a relative?
I can't let you in unless she's a relative.

946
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:10,150
Yes, she's my mother.

947
01:11:11,193 --> 01:11:13,192
Concierge!

948
01:11:16,859 --> 01:11:18,860
Phil? Mum?

949
01:11:24,195 --> 01:11:26,028
Hello?

950
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,195
Mum?

951
01:11:31,945 --> 01:11:33,986
- There you are!
- What's the matter?

952
01:11:34,153 --> 01:11:36,569
- I wondered where you were.
- Is your mother OK now?

953
01:11:36,737 --> 01:11:38,486
- Yes, thank you.
- OK, sir.

954
01:11:40,697 --> 01:11:42,737
I had to say that to get him to let me in.

955
01:11:42,905 --> 01:11:47,321
You shouldn't have the balcony door shut
if you can't hear the door to your room.

956
01:11:47,488 --> 01:11:50,155
I was just having a little cry, that's all.

957
01:11:50,323 --> 01:11:51,946
Right.

958
01:11:52,406 --> 01:11:53,906
Are you going to come back inside?

959
01:11:54,074 --> 01:11:56,031
You didn't think
I was going to jump off the balcony?

960
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,073
No, of course not.

961
01:11:59,115 --> 01:12:01,781
Did you get through to Pete Olsson?

962
01:12:01,949 --> 01:12:04,906
Just to his office. He wasn't there.

963
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,782
He doesn't want to see me, does he?

964
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:12,199
Some people have a problem
dealing with the past.

965
01:12:12,366 --> 01:12:15,949
Not you, though. But I'm sure he'll come round.

966
01:12:22,409 --> 01:12:24,409
Your chariot awaits.

967
01:12:26,534 --> 01:12:28,533
I got it in yellow.

968
01:13:21,084 --> 01:13:24,331
Now, Martin, there's something
I want to say to you.

969
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,749
Now I've made a decision
and my mind's made up.

970
01:13:26,917 --> 01:13:28,749
Nothing you can say is going to change it.

971
01:13:28,917 --> 01:13:32,541
I appreciate everything you've done for me,
and thank you for looking after me.

972
01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:35,000
And I've loved the hotels,
the food and everything,

973
01:13:35,166 --> 01:13:37,834
but this isn't working out the way I wanted it to.

974
01:13:38,001 --> 01:13:41,210
So, tomorrow I think we ought to get on a plane
and go back to England.

975
01:13:41,376 --> 01:13:43,501
There it is. Now that's an end to it.

976
01:13:43,877 --> 01:13:47,336
Don't try and change my mind
by saying clever things about this and that

977
01:13:47,503 --> 01:13:50,002
just cos you went to Oxbridge and I didn't.

978
01:13:53,086 --> 01:13:55,085
I went to Oxford. Oxford.

979
01:13:55,252 --> 01:13:57,626
Oxbridge is a portmanteau
of Oxford and Cambridge,

980
01:13:57,794 --> 01:14:01,544
- where two words are joined together.
- I don't give a... shiny shoe about that.

981
01:14:01,712 --> 01:14:04,462
- It's all the same to me!
- We should go and visit Pete Olsson.

982
01:14:04,629 --> 01:14:07,088
You can go on your own!
I'm not prepared to go all that way

983
01:14:07,255 --> 01:14:10,546
to hear someone else tell me
I didn't give two hoots about Anthony

984
01:14:10,714 --> 01:14:13,296
and that I abandoned my child
and all the rest of it.

985
01:14:13,464 --> 01:14:14,588
What's that?

986
01:14:14,756 --> 01:14:16,754
- What?
- On the side of the glass there.

987
01:14:16,922 --> 01:14:18,797
- What? What's...
- There. This.

988
01:14:20,465 --> 01:14:22,422
It's a Celtic harp.

989
01:14:22,590 --> 01:14:24,755
So we should go home.
I'll mind my own business.

990
01:14:24,924 --> 01:14:28,840
I want to watch David Attenborough
on television and I'll be happy with that.

991
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,755
And what's that?

992
01:14:33,467 --> 01:14:35,381
That's a Celtic harp.

993
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:39,966
Why would someone who cared so little about
where he came from wear something so Irish?

994
01:14:41,759 --> 01:14:45,758
Well, perhaps he played the harp. He was gay.

995
01:14:46,759 --> 01:14:48,842
He didn't play the harp.

996
01:15:48,516 --> 01:15:50,307
Well, there it is.

997
01:15:50,475 --> 01:15:52,433
(She gasps)

998
01:15:55,976 --> 01:15:59,183
I could never have given him a life like this.

999
01:15:59,977 --> 01:16:03,185
Oh, look, Martin, a little red Mazda.

1000
01:16:11,685 --> 01:16:13,310
Bye.

1001
01:16:13,811 --> 01:16:15,643
That's him.

1002
01:16:15,812 --> 01:16:17,518
That's Pete Olsson.

1003
01:16:17,687 --> 01:16:19,394
See you.

1004
01:16:23,561 --> 01:16:25,936
What do we do now?

1005
01:16:26,104 --> 01:16:28,645
- We doorstep him.
- What's that?

1006
01:16:29,396 --> 01:16:32,688
It's what nasty journalists do
when they want to speak to someone

1007
01:16:32,856 --> 01:16:34,937
who doesn't want to speak to them.

1008
01:16:55,650 --> 01:16:57,857
This shouldn't take long.

1009
01:17:05,233 --> 01:17:07,108
M...

1010
01:17:20,361 --> 01:17:22,319
- Peter Olsson.
- Yes?

1011
01:17:23,070 --> 01:17:25,610
I'm Martin Sixsmith.
I'm here with Philomena Lee,

1012
01:17:25,778 --> 01:17:28,194
the mother of your late partner Michael Hess.

1013
01:17:31,445 --> 01:17:32,652
Wait.

1014
01:17:34,236 --> 01:17:36,027
Can I just ask you one question?

1015
01:17:36,612 --> 01:17:39,027
Can you get your foot out of my door?

1016
01:17:43,614 --> 01:17:45,446
Come on.

1017
01:17:47,405 --> 01:17:49,571
Hello. Hello?

1018
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:52,447
Sir, you can leave or I'm calling the police.

1019
01:18:11,824 --> 01:18:13,823
(Sighs)

1020
01:18:17,576 --> 01:18:19,950
I'm sorry, I haven't been very helpful.

1021
01:18:21,909 --> 01:18:25,367
Never mind. At least you tried.

1022
01:18:34,535 --> 01:18:36,869
What are you doing?

1023
01:18:37,036 --> 01:18:38,493
Wait here.

1024
01:18:43,036 --> 01:18:45,035
(Car door opens)

1025
01:18:57,537 --> 01:19:00,454
- (Door unlocking)
- Yeah, get off my property or I'm...

1026
01:19:02,497 --> 01:19:04,830
I just want to talk to you about my son.

1027
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:09,496
He was taken from me.
And I've been looking for him ever since.

1028
01:19:17,164 --> 01:19:19,248
(Gentle piano music)

1029
01:20:30,591 --> 01:20:32,423
Whoa...

1030
01:20:37,716 --> 01:20:47,091
(Low conversation)

1031
01:21:04,511 --> 01:21:06,510
Would you look at him, Martin.

1032
01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:13,052
- Wait.
- What?

1033
01:21:14,137 --> 01:21:15,093
(Gasps)

1034
01:21:15,262 --> 01:21:16,551
What? What's wrong?

1035
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:19,387
You went to Ireland? You went to Roscrea?

1036
01:21:20,345 --> 01:21:22,428
Yeah. Yeah, I took him.

1037
01:21:23,471 --> 01:21:26,139
He was looking for you, Philomena.

1038
01:21:28,222 --> 01:21:31,306
- That nun, I saw her at Roscrea.
- Sister Hildegarde.

1039
01:21:31,473 --> 01:21:33,679
She's older now but that was definitely her.

1040
01:21:33,973 --> 01:21:37,847
They always told me
they didn't know where Anthony was.

1041
01:21:39,097 --> 01:21:42,473
But... they... they told us
that they couldn't find you.

1042
01:21:45,183 --> 01:21:49,557
They said that you had er...
abandoned him as a baby.

1043
01:21:49,725 --> 01:21:52,806
She's been looking for him!
She's spent her whole life trying to find him.

1044
01:21:52,974 --> 01:21:56,017
I did not abandon my child.

1045
01:22:00,352 --> 01:22:02,517
He's er... He's there now.

1046
01:22:04,601 --> 01:22:08,933
- What do you mean?
- I had this huge standoff with his... father.

1047
01:22:09,101 --> 01:22:14,225
He wanted him buried in the US,
but it was your son's dying wish.

1048
01:22:15,894 --> 01:22:17,977
He said he wanted to go home.

1049
01:22:20,646 --> 01:22:22,395
He's buried at Roscrea.

1050
01:22:23,978 --> 01:22:25,770
(Gasps)

1051
01:22:34,687 --> 01:22:36,478
(Exhales)

1052
01:23:19,735 --> 01:23:21,735
We've come full circle.

1053
01:23:22,736 --> 01:23:24,567
Yes.

1054
01:23:25,194 --> 01:23:28,441
The end of all our exploring
will be to arrive where we started

1055
01:23:28,610 --> 01:23:30,443
and know the place for the first time.

1056
01:23:30,610 --> 01:23:34,318
That's lovely, Martin. Did you just think of that?

1057
01:23:34,986 --> 01:23:36,402
No, it's TS Eliot.

1058
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,819
Well, never mind. It's still very nice.

1059
01:23:42,779 --> 01:23:44,445
Shall we go in?

1060
01:23:44,612 --> 01:23:47,363
You're not going to make a scene in there,
are you?

1061
01:23:48,863 --> 01:23:50,488
I just want to ask a few questions.

1062
01:23:51,614 --> 01:23:54,363
I don't want any tea, and I don't want any cake.

1063
01:24:03,865 --> 01:24:05,947
(Buzzer)

1064
01:24:12,658 --> 01:24:14,991
- Do come in, Philomena.
- Thank you.

1065
01:24:22,116 --> 01:24:25,699
Sister Claire's asked
if you can wait in here for her.

1066
01:24:34,201 --> 01:24:37,075
Now remember, Martin. It's not their fault.

1067
01:24:37,243 --> 01:24:39,451
They didn't know Anthony had a different name.

1068
01:24:46,077 --> 01:24:48,078
(Sighs)

1069
01:24:51,662 --> 01:24:53,411
One of them did.

1070
01:24:53,578 --> 01:24:55,577
Martin!

1071
01:25:14,165 --> 01:25:16,204
Goodbye, Sister.
See you at Mass, bright and early.

1072
01:25:16,372 --> 01:25:19,205
Excuse me. What are you doing?
You're not allowed in here.

1073
01:25:19,372 --> 01:25:23,123
- He just walked straight in.
- This is completely inappropriate behaviour!

1074
01:25:24,917 --> 01:25:27,206
Sister Hildegarde,
it's OK, I'm not going to hurt you.

1075
01:25:27,375 --> 01:25:30,290
I just want to ask you a question.
I'm a friend of Philomena Lee.

1076
01:25:30,457 --> 01:25:32,540
I saw you on a video with her son.

1077
01:25:32,707 --> 01:25:35,249
Now, when you knew
they were looking for each other,

1078
01:25:35,416 --> 01:25:37,500
- why did you keep them apart?
- (Key in lock)

1079
01:25:37,668 --> 01:25:39,625
We'll call the guards unless you leave now.

1080
01:25:39,793 --> 01:25:41,542
I'm not leaving until she answers me.

1081
01:25:41,709 --> 01:25:45,334
I'm sorry, I think your whole manner
is absolutely disgusting.

1082
01:25:45,501 --> 01:25:48,334
I'll tell you what's disgusting,
is lying to a dying man.

1083
01:25:48,503 --> 01:25:51,917
You could have given him a few moments
with his mother before he passed away

1084
01:25:52,085 --> 01:25:53,209
but you chose not to.

1085
01:25:53,377 --> 01:25:55,001
- That's disgusting.
- Come on, Sister.

1086
01:25:55,169 --> 01:25:56,918
You don't have to listen to this.

1087
01:25:57,086 --> 01:25:59,460
- Not very Christian, is it?
- Wait!

1088
01:26:05,172 --> 01:26:07,253
Let me tell you something.

1089
01:26:08,253 --> 01:26:13,295
I have kept my vow of chastity my whole life.

1090
01:26:14,837 --> 01:26:20,087
Self-denial and mortification of the flesh...
that's what brings us closer to God.

1091
01:26:20,255 --> 01:26:21,337
Sister Hildegarde...

1092
01:26:21,506 --> 01:26:27,505
Those girls have nobody to blame but themselves,
and their own carnal incontinence.

1093
01:26:27,672 --> 01:26:29,631
Sister Hildegarde, please!

1094
01:26:29,798 --> 01:26:31,173
You mean they had sex?

1095
01:26:31,839 --> 01:26:35,924
What's done is done.
What do you expect us to do about it now?

1096
01:26:36,091 --> 01:26:37,757
Nothing.

1097
01:26:39,007 --> 01:26:41,340
There's nothing to be done or said.

1098
01:26:42,924 --> 01:26:45,924
I've found my son. That's what I came here for.

1099
01:26:46,090 --> 01:26:48,549
- Martin.
- Hang on. I'll tell you what you can do.

1100
01:26:48,717 --> 01:26:52,258
Say sorry. How about that?
Apologise. Stop trying to cover things up.

1101
01:26:52,426 --> 01:26:54,466
Get out there and clear all the weeds and crap

1102
01:26:54,634 --> 01:26:57,425
off the graves of the mothers and babies
that died in childbirth.

1103
01:26:57,592 --> 01:27:00,134
Their suffering was atonement for their sins.

1104
01:27:00,302 --> 01:27:03,717
- One of the mothers was 14 years old!
- Martin, that's enough.

1105
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:07,759
The Lord Jesus Christ will be my judge,
not the likes of you.

1106
01:27:07,927 --> 01:27:11,468
Really? I think if Jesus was here,
he'd tip you out of that fucking wheelchair

1107
01:27:11,636 --> 01:27:15,053
- and you wouldn't get up and walk.
- Stop! Stop! I'm sorry.

1108
01:27:16,054 --> 01:27:18,178
I didn't want to bring him in here
to make a scene.

1109
01:27:18,346 --> 01:27:21,886
Why are you apologising? Anthony was dying and she still wouldn't
tell him about you.

1110
01:27:22,053 --> 01:27:23,844
But it happened to me. Not you.

1111
01:27:24,013 --> 01:27:26,344
It's up to me what I do about it. It's my choice.

1112
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:29,512
So, what? You're just going to do nothing?

1113
01:27:33,223 --> 01:27:35,055
No.

1114
01:27:38,638 --> 01:27:40,220
Sister Hildegarde...

1115
01:27:43,389 --> 01:27:46,848
I want you to know... that I forgive you.

1116
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:52,766
What? Just like that?

1117
01:27:53,599 --> 01:27:57,682
It's not just like that. That's hard.
That's hard for me.

1118
01:27:58,850 --> 01:28:01,182
But I don't want to hate people.

1119
01:28:01,933 --> 01:28:04,309
I don't want to be like you.

1120
01:28:06,434 --> 01:28:08,349
Look at you.

1121
01:28:09,268 --> 01:28:11,684
I'm angry.

1122
01:28:11,851 --> 01:28:14,351
It must be exhausting.

1123
01:28:17,726 --> 01:28:22,102
Sister Claire, I wonder would you be so kind
as to take me to my son's grave.

1124
01:28:38,938 --> 01:28:40,521
Well...

1125
01:28:42,564 --> 01:28:44,564
I couldn't forgive you.

1126
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:10,523
(Door opens)

1127
01:29:11,566 --> 01:29:13,774
It's all right. I've calmed down.

1128
01:29:14,650 --> 01:29:16,942
I just want to buy something.

1129
01:30:07,948 --> 01:30:09,989
He knew I'd find him here.

1130
01:30:17,075 --> 01:30:19,281
I'm not going to publish the story.

1131
01:30:22,575 --> 01:30:24,574
It's between you and him.

1132
01:30:28,991 --> 01:30:30,991
I got you something.

1133
01:30:32,785 --> 01:30:34,741
Oh, Martin.

1134
01:30:36,118 --> 01:30:38,117
Thank you.

1135
01:30:56,287 --> 01:31:01,495
You know, I just decided...
I did want you to tell my story after all.

1136
01:31:02,704 --> 01:31:05,162
People should know what happened here.

1137
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,666
Did I tell you, Martin, I've finished that book?
The Saddle And The Loom.

1138
01:31:38,834 --> 01:31:41,790
- Would you like to read it?
- Erm...

1139
01:31:43,834 --> 01:31:46,083
Why don't you tell me about it?

1140
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:49,625
- (Engine starts)
- Well... there's this weaver.

1141
01:31:50,751 --> 01:31:54,001
She's quite plain really.
Well, she's pretty but she's plain.

1142
01:31:54,169 --> 01:31:55,210
I like plain girls.

1143
01:31:55,377 --> 01:31:58,751
Yes, well, and she's been told
that she has to work all through the night,

1144
01:31:58,919 --> 01:32:01,001
to weave a beautiful cloak,

1145
01:32:01,169 --> 01:32:05,544
of the finest silk for the master to wear
on his wedding day.

1146
01:32:05,712 --> 01:32:11,586
So in the morning she shows him the cloak
and she asks him, "What do you think, kind sir?"

1147
01:32:11,753 --> 01:32:14,502
And he says, "It's beautiful.

1148
01:32:14,670 --> 01:32:18,045
I've never seen anything more beautiful
in my whole life."

1149
01:32:18,213 --> 01:32:20,753
But guess what?
He's not even looking at the cloak.

1150
01:32:20,921 --> 01:32:22,670
He's looking at her! (Chuckles)

1151
01:32:22,838 --> 01:32:26,338
Well, I didn't see that coming, Martin.
Not in a million years.
