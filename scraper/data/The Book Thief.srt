1
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,959
<i>One small fact.</i>

2
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,399
<i>You are going to die.</i>

3
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,446
<i>Despite every effort,
no one lives forever.</i>

4
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,159
<i>Sorry to be such a spoiler.</i>

5
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,799
<i>My advice is, when the
time comes, don't panic.</i>

6
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,162
<i>It doesn't seem to help.</i>

7
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,399
<i>I guess I should
introduce myself properly.</i>

8
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,399
<i>But then again,
you'll meet me soon enough.</i>

9
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,039
<i>Not before your time, of course.</i>

10
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,131
<i>I make it a policy
to avoid the living.</i>

11
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,879
<i>Well, except sometimes.</i>

12
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,368
<i>Once in a very long time...</i>

13
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,687
<i>I can't help myself.</i>

14
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,199
<i>I get interested.</i>

15
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,642
<i>I don't know exactly what it
was about Liesel Meminger.</i>

16
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,768
<i>But she caught me.</i>

17
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,925
Mama.

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,611
<i>And I cared.</i>

19
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,644
Do you want to say a few words?

20
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,048
Goodbye my darling

21
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,210
She would have kept you
if she could have.

22
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,520
You know that, don't you?

23
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,090
Here we are. Come, Liesel.

24
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,562
Meet your new parents.

25
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,445
Come.

26
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,359
Hans Hubermann.

27
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,641
Heinrich.

28
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,805
Heinrich.

29
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,725
Where is the boy?

30
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,726
He died.

31
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,599
What do you mean?

32
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,079
On the way here.

33
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,999
They had to bury him by the tracks.

34
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,839
They promised us two children,
with two allowances.

35
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,079
Rosa, you cannot
blame the boy for dying.

36
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,359
No, I blame his mother.

37
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,879
Dragging them across the
country unfed, unwashed!

38
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,279
She was running for her life.

39
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,606
Have you seen that girl?

40
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,479
Filthy.

41
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,799
Everything they say about communists
is true. Dirty and stupid.

42
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,446
I'll speak as loud as I want.

43
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,121
Come.

44
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,806
Come!

45
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,924
What is the matter with her?

46
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,803
Your Majesty.

47
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,000
What are you brats looking at?

48
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,088
This is Heaven Street,
your new home.

49
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,130
Hey, lover boy! Can we get
on with the game now?

50
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,003
Please, go in.

51
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,004
Well, go on.

52
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,641
What do you say?

53
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,526
They have given us a mute.

54
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,129
Go upstairs.

55
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,086
Where is it?

56
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,360
That one.

57
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,050
It's for you.

58
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,199
Hans!

59
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,164
Ja, my sunshine?

60
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,170
Good morning, Your Majesty.

61
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,726
Would you stop that racket?

62
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,282
What do you say?

63
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,639
Thank you.

64
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,966
It speaks?

65
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,084
Now, listen, from now on
you call me "Mama," ja?

66
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,166
Say it.

67
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,119
Mama.

68
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,401
Good.

69
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,728
And that Saukerl,
that lazy pig over there...

70
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,202
you call him "Papa."
Understood?

71
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,441
Papa.

72
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,479
Who is that?

73
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,091
Who is it?

74
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,799
Rudy Steiner, Frau Hubermann.

75
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,206
What do you want?

76
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,362
My mother says you've
got a daughter now.

77
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,205
What's it to you?

78
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,361
I'm here to take her to school.

79
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,088
Why can't people ever
mind their own business?

80
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,199
Hello, Rudy.

81
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,481
Hello!

82
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,519
And what makes you think you are
good enough for my daughter?

83
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,721
Rudy.

84
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,730
I'm almost 12.

85
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,959
Liesel, eat your soup
and go and get dressed.

86
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,925
Stay outside, you filthy Saukerl.

87
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,331
Hurry up, Liesel.

88
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,040
Do you like to run?

89
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,083
I bet I could beat you.

90
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,927
No one has ever
beaten me in a race.

91
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,168
You don't say much, do you?

92
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,929
Is that one spit, "Yes,"
and two spits, "No"?

93
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,605
I'm glad we
understand each other.

94
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,640
My mother didn't really tell
me to come and get you.

95
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,607
I just thought
you might need a friend.

96
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,962
<i>Danke schön!</i>
Rudy!

97
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,411
What are you up to?

98
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,799
Nothing, Papa.

99
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,319
Then get to school.

100
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,411
Come on.

101
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,526
You are?

102
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,644
Frau Hubermann's new daughter.

103
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,963
I was not addressing you, Steiner.

104
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,489
Girl, speak.

105
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,766
Liesel Meminger.

106
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,010
Chalk, board, name.

107
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,206
Come, girl.
We don't have all day.

108
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,291
Write it.

109
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,241
Silence.

110
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,565
Silence!

111
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,451
Back to your seat, now.

112
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,925
Silence.

113
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,883
<i>Dummkopf!
Dummkopf! Dummkopf!</i>

114
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,319
Hey, Dummkopf.
Can't you even read yet?

115
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,199
Go on. Read one word.
Read something.

116
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,561
<i>Dummkopf.</i>

117
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,241
She's killing him!

118
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,849
I bet that wasn't your first fight.

119
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,679
Franz Deutscher hasn't
been hit like that...

120
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,399
since he peed in
Tommy Muller's lunchbox.

121
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,479
Franz Deutscher
doesn't sound very smart.

122
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,808
He's the dumbest kid in school.

123
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,527
But he shaves.

124
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,079
You remember how to get home?

125
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,079
Just because I can't read
doesn't make me stupid.

126
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,521
All right.
I'll follow you, then.

127
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,639
You could join our
soccer team, you know?

128
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,925
Look, you should probably just
stop trying to be my friend...

129
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,039
because I won't be
here long enough.

130
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,480
Why not?

131
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,439
I'm running away.
That's why not.

132
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,919
Where to?

133
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,884
None of your business.

134
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,599
Well, let me know when.

135
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,961
Why?

136
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,409
So I can come with you.

137
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,759
You don't understand.
I'm serious.

138
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,479
I have to find my mother.

139
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,719
Frau Hubermann?

140
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,799
<i>Nein, Dummkopf.</i>
My real mother.

141
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,919
Great.

142
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,168
I'd like to meet her.

143
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,879
What are you doing now?

144
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,206
Racing you.

145
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,885
I'll bet you a kiss I can beat you.

146
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,641
Why would I want to kiss you?

147
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,039
I don't know.
What does that matter?

148
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,969
I'm the one who's going to win.

149
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,841
Just to the end of the street.

150
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,331
And what if I win?

151
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,206
You don't have to kiss me.

152
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,805
Ever?

153
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,959
What do you care?

154
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,561
You're not sticking around, right?

155
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,449
<i>Hey! Saumensch!</i>

156
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,087
You cheated.

157
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,641
So what?

158
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,651
I beat you.
Did not.

159
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,361
It was a draw.

160
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,279
Draw means I get the kiss.

161
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,925
You can stick your kiss.

162
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,281
Oh, my God.

163
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,444
She's going to kill you.

164
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,521
Who?

165
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,086
If you think that I am
some kind of pushover...

166
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,239
you are very much mistaken.

167
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,805
Do you hear?

168
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,171
I have just come to say good night.

169
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,171
What is this?

170
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,281
Is it yours?

171
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,002
Why would a nice girl like you
want to read such a thing?

172
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,802
Are you sure this is yours?

173
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,487
It wasn't always mine.

174
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,159
It belonged to my brother.

175
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,407
I see.

176
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,439
Your brother...

177
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,644
his name was Pieter Strauss?

178
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,525
Do you know what this says?

179
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,880
Do you want to know what it says?

180
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,841
I'm not such a good
reader myself, you know.

181
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,846
We will have to
help each other out.

182
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,841
<i>Ja?</i>

183
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,240
We better get started.

184
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,243
<i>"The Gravedigger's Handbook."</i>

185
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:03,046
Raise the red flags
for German effort

186
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,645
we want to pave the way to freedom

187
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,011
For German effort

188
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,730
we want to pave the way to freedom

189
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,886
We do not create a brother pact

190
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,761
with Jews or non-Germanics

191
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,250
Because they falsify
the liberty certificate

192
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:37,169
of Germany's people

193
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,039
Walter.

194
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,481
Listen, he told me
he can only take one.

195
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,879
Take Max.
No, Mama.

196
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,079
Take him! Go!

197
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,319
I won't leave without you.

198
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,521
Yes, you will.

199
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,519
Upon your father's grave, you will.

200
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,959
There's no time for heroics, Max.

201
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,491
One or none.

202
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,960
Come.

203
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,439
The papers are inside.

204
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,927
They don't look great,
but they'll have to do.

205
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,286
Go find him.

206
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,210
Forgive me.

207
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,602
<i>When I finally caught up
with Max Vandenberg's soul...</i>

208
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,966
<i>it was this moment
that haunted him the most.</i>

209
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,359
<i>For leaving his mother.</i>

210
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,281
<i>For feeling that awful,
light-headed relief...</i>

211
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,247
<i>that he would live.</i>

212
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,359
Jesse Owens is
the fastest man on earth.

213
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,528
Hey, watch out, you two.

214
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,010
What are you doing, Papa?

215
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,521
Working, for once.

216
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,010
I thought you painted signs,
not scraped them off.

217
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,170
Well, the scraping-off
business is picking up, Rudy.

218
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,481
What can you do?

219
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,684
"Accountant."

220
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,084
You make me proud, girl.
She's clever, Rudy.

221
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,886
<i>Ja,</i> sir.

222
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,566
What's an accountant?

223
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,009
Something we will never need.

224
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,239
"We wish you...

225
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,809

We made it.
Your first book.

232
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,969
Congratulations.

233
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,439
So, promise me one thing, Liesel.

234
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,406
If I die anytime soon,
make sure they bury me right.

235
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,841
<i>Ja?
Ja.</i>

236
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,686
No skipping chapter six.

237
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,290
Can we start again?

238
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,090
Tomorrow.

239
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,879
But it is tomorrow.

240
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,366
You sleep now.

241
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,129
His name was Werner.

242
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,962
Come.
I have a surprise for you.

243
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,159
It's very dark here.

244
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,044
We had better turn on the light.

245
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,165
It's a dictionary.

246
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,722
Some of the words we have learned.

247
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,722
Add as many as you like.

248
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,684
It's yours.

249
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,083
Thank you, Papa.

250
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,319
He's done it!
He's made history!

251
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,759
Jesse Owens...

252
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,325
the fastest man alive!

253
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,519
Hey!

254
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,450
What is this?

255
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,881
Ow!

256
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,729
You want to remain a member?
Teach your son!

257
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,279
Why?

258
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,599
Why Jesse Owens?

259
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,879
Why?

260
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,399
He's the fastest man on earth.

261
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,199
The fastest man on earth!

262
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,239
The boy is crazy.

263
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,807
- Ow! That hurts.
- Sit still, Rudy.

264
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,959
It's even in his earholes.

265
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,446
Barbra...

266
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,370
Fine, you deal with him.

267
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,079
Son...

268
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,399
you can't go around painting
yourself black, you hear?

269
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,761
Why not?

270
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,926
Because you shouldn't
want to be black people.

271
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,966
Why?

272
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,964
Because I say so. Ja?

273
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,804
<i>"Dear Mama, today is the
Fuhrer's birthday.</i>

Hans, where did you put the flag?

281
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,039
If we don't find it, it's going to
look like we're saying something.

282
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,279
All right, all right, all right.

283
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,244
I'm going to look in the basement.

284
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,485
God in Heaven.

285
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,799
Liesel, I know you
like it down here...

286
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,279
but don't you think
you should be outside a bit?

287
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,999
I'm writing Mama a letter.

288
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,879
Well, that's very good.

289
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,839
Please tell her, from me, I could
do without all the nagging.

290
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,690
Not that mama.

291
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,126
I see.

292
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,241
What are you telling her?

293
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,999
Everything.

294
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,522
About you und Mama und Rudy.

295
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,247
Can you send it for me?

296
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,159
Well...

297
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,488
You could give it to the woman
who brought me here.

298
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,889
Frau Heinrich? Ja.

299
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,202
I'm sure she would do
her best to pass it on.

300
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,327
Ah, found it.

301
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,919
What is she doing writing
to her mother, anyway?

302
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,519
She's her mother.

303
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,159
I'm not going to
waste good money...

304
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,999
on a stamp for a letter that's
never going to be answered.

305
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,679
What was I to say?

306
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,724
Hans?
Alex.

307
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,039
Good man.
Are you ready to go?

308
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,679
Of course he is.

309
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,719
Liesel!

310
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,251
Come on, Liesel,
we'll miss the parade.

311
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,971
Right.

312
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,639
Come on, let's go.

313
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,604
<i>Saumensch.</i>
Hello, Rudy.

314
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,208
During this National
Socialist revolution

315
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:20,447
as much as our nation prospers,
we should not decrease

316
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,924
our determination to
cleanse ourselves morally

317
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,083
and intellectually from within

318
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,807
Education, theater,
films, literature, the press

319
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,839
these are the supporting pillars

320
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,239
which shape the unique
personality of our nation

321
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:47,931
And that is why we
have gathered here tonight

322
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,446
to free ourselves from
any intellectual dirt

323
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,527
We will exterminate the illness

324
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,970
that infected Germany
for the last twenty years

325
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,408
We will completely
destroy the chains

326
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,247
that were forged to enslave us

327
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:25,890
We will fight our
enemies and if that means war

328
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,843
then we will stand by our
Fuhrer until the final victory

329
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:38,041
Such a war will see
our nation restored

330
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,327
and bring an end to our enemies

331
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,651
The end of plutocrats

332
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,682
The end of communists

333
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,845
And the end of Jews

334
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,967
To our great German Empire

335
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,729
and to our beloved Fuhrer,
Adolf Hitler

336
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,839
<i>- Sieg!
- Heil!</i>

337
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,409
Hey, Jesse Owens.

338
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,841
Push off, Franz.

339
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,359
Leave him alone.

340
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,599
Did you like the speech, Dummkopf?
Were you listening?

341
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,879
What about it?

342
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,639
Your mother was one, wasn't she?

343
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,968
A communist?
That's what they say.

344
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,479
Who's "they"?

345
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,920
You even look like one.

346
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,599
What are you talking about?

347
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,639
I'm not talking
to you, Steiner.

348
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,205
She knows.

349
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,451
Burn a book.

350
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,169
Go on, burn a book.

351
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,603
Go on! I'll be watching.
Both of you.

352
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,239
What was that about?

353
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,965
Nothing.

354
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,721
Liesel.

355
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,399
Where have you been? I said
to meet me at the church.

356
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,999
Sorry, Papa.

357
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,440
Let's go now.

358
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,085
What is it?

359
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,971
Nothing.

360
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,519
Are you sick?

361
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,722
Nein. I'm fine.

362
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,640
Tell me, what is the
matter with you?

363
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,404
What the hell is this?

364
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,201
You stole it?

365
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,281
Sorry, Papa.

366
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,402
Are you going to tell Mama?

367
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,166
Papa?

368
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,404
Did anyone see you?

369
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,970
I'll tell you what.

370
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,971
Let's make this our secret.

371
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,409
We'll read it like the other book.

372
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,719
In the basement.

373
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,445
Thank you, Papa.

374
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,600
Good, now.

375
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,762
We better get back before Mama worries.
We don't want that.

376
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,524
Liesel, come.

377
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,284
What is it?

378
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,364
Liesel?

379
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,047
My mother isn't
coming back, is she?

380
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,921
Is she a communist?

381
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,769
Who told you that?
Is she?

382
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,804
Did the fuhrer take her away?

383
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,599
Then I hate the fuhrer.

384
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,006
<i>Nein.</i>

385
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,323
You can't say that.

386
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,803
Don't ever say that.

387
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,361
Understand?

388
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,441
Come.

389
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:07,159
<i>"The Invisible Man</i>
by H.G. Wells."

390
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,010
Sounds good.

391
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,690
"Chapter one.

392
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,084
"The Strange Man's Arrival.

393
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,925
"The stranger came early in Feb..."

394
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,966
"February." Ah.

395
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,840
Good girl.

396
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,199
Who's that?

397
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,366
Papa, who is it?

398
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,563
Hans Hubermann?
Ja.

399
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,084
Do you still play the accordion?

400
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,767
Quickly.

401
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,291
Papa!
Liesel, go to bed!

402
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,400
What is this?

403
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,119
Max.

404
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,845
No. No.

405
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,251
Help me.

406
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,565
We'll put him upstairs.

407
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,488
Liesel, everything is fine.

408
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,526
Here we go.

409
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,202
I'll warm him some soup.

410
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,324
Who is he, Papa?

411
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,203
I have something very
important to tell you, Liesel.

412
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,408
You must listen.

413
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,408
That is not my accordion.

414
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,690
The man who owns that accordion
is this boy's father.

415
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,759
You stole it?

416
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,121
<i>Nein.</i>

417
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,289
I've been looking after it.

418
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,444
Did he die?

419
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,006
<i>Ja.</i>

420
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,609
Many years ago.

421
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,327
Before you were born.

422
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,203
I saw him die.

423
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,770
In a war.

424
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,559
You were in a war?

425
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,761
<i>Ja.</i>

426
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,127
His father gave up his life...

427
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,085
for me.

428
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,799
And I made a
promise to the family...

429
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,641
if ever I could help them, I would.
I gave them my word.

430
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,126
Now, I need you to promise me.

431
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,799
I need you to give me your word

432
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,844
that you will not tell
anyone about our visitor.

433
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,044
Nobody. Not a soul.

434
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,483
Not even Rudy.

435
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,890
I mean it, Liesel.

436
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,328
Not a soul.

437
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,769
Understand?

438
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,159
<i>Ja.</i>

439
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,331
A person is only as good
as their word, Liesel.

440
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,521
Do I have yours?

441
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,845
Ja, Papa.

442
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,041
I promise.

443
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,719
Did you talk to her?

444
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,001
<i>Ja.</i>

445
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,999
She can't tell a soul.

446
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,611
She knows.

447
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,929
Can we trust her?
She's our daughter.

448
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,889
She's a child!
Rosa.

449
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,203
We have no choice.

450
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,924
He looks like death.

451
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,999
He's probably forgotten
what food tastes like.

452
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,239
What are we going to feed him on?

453
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,801
We barely have enough
to feed ourselves!

454
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,121
We will make do.

455
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,368
"We will make do."

456
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:47,047
We have always known
that one day this may happen.

457
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,642
We could turn him in tomorrow.

458
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,599
The authorities would understand.

459
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,039
We could say
that it was late at night...

460
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,239
Rosa.

461
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,522
I know.
He came to us.

462
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,767
I owe his family everything.
I know.

463
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,804
Then, that's all.

464
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,601
We'll just go about things
as normally as possible.

465
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,447
Hello.

466
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,366
Hello.

467
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,288
What were you dreaming about?

468
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,330
My mother.

469
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,524
Is that your book?

470
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,721
<i>Ja.</i>

471
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,926
Nein, it...

472
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,528
it wasn't always mine.

473
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,730
Did you steal it?

474
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,406
<i>Nein.</i>

475
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,368
Can I see it?
It's...

476
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,799
It's not for children.

477
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,766
Ah.

478
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,323
Good morning, Max.

479
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,166
You have met Liesel?

480
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,001
Liesel.

481
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,325
Don't worry.

482
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,730
She's a good girl.

483
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,568
Not a word.

484
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,561
Good, <i>Saumensch.</i>

485
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,279
What's the rush?

486
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,130
I have to get home.

487
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,765
Race you.

488
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,204
I have to go inside.

489
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,963
What do you want?
My permission?

490
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,079
Nein. I'm just telling you.

491
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,406
Fine.

492
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,245
<i>See you, Saumensch.</i>

493
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,039
Where have you been?
You're late.

494
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,242
I ran as fast as I could.

495
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,439
And you mentioned
nothing to no one?

496
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,404
<i>Nein,</i> Mama.
Rosa...

497
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,482
Liesel! He's asleep.

498
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,559
Mmm.

499
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,207
At least someone knows how
to appreciate my cooking.

500
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,605
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

501
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,047
Is he going to be all right?

502
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,450
Of course.

503
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,003
You're a curious girl.

504
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,239
I didn't mean to.

505
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,964
It's all right.

506
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,441
What is it about?

507
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,081
Hitler.

508
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,364
Are you hiding from Hitler?

509
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,807
<i>Ja.</i>

510
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,131
Are you a communist?

511
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,561
I'm a Jew.

512
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,089
Did he take away your mother?

513
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,290
Probably.

514
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,325
Don't worry.

515
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,246
I cried a lot
when I first came, too.

516
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,121
The soup is terrible, isn't it?

517
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,931
You may find this
hard to believe, but...

518
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,610
it's the best thing
I've ever thrown up.

519
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,725
Liesel!

520
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,368
I have a job for you.

521
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,641
And don't forget to
count the money.

522
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,639
Come back with the right amount

523
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,127
or don't bother coming back at all.

524
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,967
The <i>Bürgermeister's</i> house.

525
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,208
Are you sure?

526
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,049
Do you see any other houses
looking like this?

527
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,723
He had dinner with the fuhrer once.

528
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,611
Laundry.

529
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,441
Come in.

530
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,767
Go on.

531
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,845
Wait.

532
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,481
Danke schön.

533
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,086
So, you like books?

534
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,321
Come.

535
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,447
<i>"The Dream Carrier."</i>

536
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,526
Rudy.

537
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,167
I have to go.

538
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,919
You can come back
whenever you want.

539
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,963
It will be here.

540
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,450
Ja, Frau Hermann.

541
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,799
Call me "Ilsa."

542
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,809
What shall I call you?

543
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,401
Liesel.

544
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,847
You are a brave girl, Liesel.

545
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,845
<i>Come back, Saumensch!</i>

546
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,525
Catch me!

547
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,362
Hey, Dummkopf! Did you hear?
England declared war on us!

548
00:51:07,388 --> 00:51:08,879
We're at war with England!

549
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,691
We're at war!

550
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,519
England declared war!

551
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:23,999
<i>It's always been the same,
the excitement and rush to war.</i>

552
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,679
<i>I've met so many young men
over the years...</i>

553
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,839
<i>who have thought they were
running at their enemy.</i>

554
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,726
<i>When the truth was,
they were running to me.</i>

555
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,726
<i>Ja!</i>

556
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,721
Excellent.

557
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,961
You should look
where you're going next time.

558
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,325
Drop dead, Franz.

559
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:13,208
What's up, Jesse Owens?
I thought you liked being black.

560
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,925
Who is Johann?

561
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,010
He used to love to read.

562
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,886
And he was brave.
Just like you.

563
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,285
This is all him.
Everything he knew.

564
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,611
All here.

565
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,561
All in its place.

566
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,849
They never found his body.

567
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:18,321
If they could have shown me his
body, I would have believed them.

568
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,041
But how can a mother give up?

569
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,804
A mother never
gives up on her child.

570
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,289
I have to go.

571
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,361
Do you think my mother
really loved me?

572
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,569
Of course.

573
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,247
Every mother loves her child.

574
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,649
Even Hitler's.

575
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,404
Do you think she writes to him?

576
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,721
"Dear fuhrer...

577
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,559
"just wait until
your father gets home.

578
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,569
"Love, Mama."

579
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,679
"Dear fuhrer, clean up your mess."

580
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,042
"Dear fuhrer, who cut your hair?"

581
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,129
"You're not going
out in that, are you?"

582
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,359
"What's that growing on your lip?"

583
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,369
"Don't raise your voice at me."

584
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,410
"Stop spitting when you yell."

585
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,761
Hans...

586
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,250
he's getting bedsores.

587
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,162
Then he needs to get up
and move about.

588
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,239
He can't just walk around.

589
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,399
Why not?

590
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,319
Because people will see in.

591
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,442
He can't lay still forever.
He needs to be moved.

592
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,921
Why?

593
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,239
The mouth on it!
Because I say so.

594
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,399
Rosa.

595
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,125
And what do you propose?

596
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,961
"Propose"?
Listen to this one.

597
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,801
I propose that we
put him downstairs.

598
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,848
It's not good, we know that.

599
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,759
I'm sorry.

600
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,599
Please don't apologize. I've
put you all in such danger.

601
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,131
It's more than I deserve.

602
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,651
Liesel's lessons.
It is a dictionary.

603
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,607
I tried to make it as
comfortable as I could.

604
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,450
I'm sorry, there's no bed.

605
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,048
If anyone saw, you know?

606
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,319
You feel free to do your
lessons whenever you want.

607
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,761
Make sure you knock first.

608
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,482
I'm just downstairs.
I'm not going anywhere.

609
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,886
Promise.

610
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,245
Don't give me that look.

611
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,564
"Jellyfish."

612
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,639
"Jellyfish."

613
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,841
Jellyfish.

614
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,610
Tell me, where do you
get these words?

615
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,366
It's a secret.

616
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,963
And who would I tell?

617
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,401
<i>The Bürgermeister's wife.</i>

618
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,607
She lets me read her books.

619
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,003
I memorize them.

620
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,571
"Memory is the scribe of the soul."

621
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,200
Do you know who said that?

622
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,166
A man called Aristotle.

623
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,444
Can you do me a favor?

624
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,406
Can you describe the day for me?

625
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,002
What's it like outside?

626
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,679
It's cloudy.

627
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,041
No, no, no.

628
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,329
Make the words yours.

629
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,762
If your eyes could speak...

630
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,965
what would they say?

631
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,809
It's a pale day.

632
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,441
"Pale." Good. Go on.

633
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,283
Everything's stuck behind a cloud.

634
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,647
Lind the sun...

635
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,929
doesn't look like the sun.

636
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,170
What does it look like?

637
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:49,682
Like a silver oyster?

638
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,641
Thank you. I saw that.

639
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,049
We're hiding a Jew.

640
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,362
Johann?

641
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,166
<i>Nein.</i>

642
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,206
It's Liesel.

643
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,208
What's the meaning of this?

644
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,561
Lind he didn't say why?

645
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,279
I don't understand it.

646
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:35,559
I've always ironed his shirts
in exactly the same way.

647
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:37,759
Maybe they can't
afford it any longer.

648
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,530
They can't afford it?

649
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,930
We can't afford it.

650
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,719
It's another customer gone.

651
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,279
And four mouths to feed.

652
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,046
Well.

653
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:01,521
It's two meals a day
from now on, not three.

654
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,771
That's all there is to it.

655
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,725
I've made you a suit.

656
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:40,250
I want you to wear it
on your 14th birthday.

657
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,799
You'll be back then, Papa.

658
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,604
Won't you?

659
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,366
Hans!

660
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,159
Rosa...

661
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,319
I'm asking you, I'm begging you...

662
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:04,889
would you please keep your
mouth shut for five minutes?

663
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,679
I brought you something.

664
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:14,719
Is this today's?
<i>Ja.</i>

665
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,039
A gift from Franz Deutscher.

666
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:20,084
That boy doesn't know
how generous he is.

667
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,521
"Hitler poised to take Moscow."

668
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,962
The world has turned mad.

669
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,886
But...

670
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,930
aren't we winning the war?

671
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,487
Max?

672
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:51,122
Where's my weather report?

673
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,285
You're full of wonders.

674
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,566
I've got an idea.

675
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:56,161
What on earth are you doing?

676
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,085
Go, go, go!

677
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,041
Max.

678
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,441
I have no more snow!

679
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:28,319
Get him, Max!

680
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:31,439
What in God's name are you
Saukerle doing down here?

681
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,641
Rosa!

682
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,969
There's a madwoman on the battlefield!
<i>Nein, nein!</i>

683
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,484
I'm unarmed!

684
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:04,999
This is the stupidest thing
that I have ever done.

685
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,248
Lind look how happy you are.

686
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,799
What do we do when it melts?

687
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,399
<i>You mop it up, Saumensch.</i>

688
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,080
It won't melt.
It's freezing down here.

689
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,559
I don't know how
you do it every night.

690
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,359
Please, don't think about me.

691
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,528
Nonsense.
We all think about you.

692
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,921
This is the best Christmas.

693
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:36,929
This is my first Christmas.

694
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,008
Now you know what you've
been missing out on.

695
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,239
We should call it a night.

696
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,399
Nein, Papa. Please.

697
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,761
Listen to your father.

698
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,839
You can stay a little longer.

699
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:51,247
Oh, you're too soft on that girl.

700
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,209
I've made you a Christmas gift.

701
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,770
It's all I had.

702
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,599
But...

703
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,801
Open it.

704
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,321
"For Liesel...

705
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,650
"from Max."

706
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,049
What does it say?

707
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,091
"Write."

708
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:46,999
In my religion...

709
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,283
we're taught that
every living thing...

710
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,079
every leaf, every bird...

711
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:57,330
is only alive because it contains
the secret word for life.

712
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:04,049
That's the only difference between
us and a lump of clay. A word.

713
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:09,047
Words are life, Liesel.

714
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,689
All those blank pages...

715
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:14,566
they're for you to fill.

716
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,084
My God.

717
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,999
Is he going to die?

718
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,519
Shut up!

719
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:57,610
I won't have that talk in this
house. Do you understand?

720
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:01,399
I haven't starved us all for the
better part of two years...

721
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:04,251
just so that he could die.

722
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:07,881
It's my fault.

723
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:10,249
Why is it your fault?

724
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,206
It was my idea
to build that snowman.

725
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,089
Why did we build it?

726
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,602
Because we had to.

727
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:27,563
You said you weren't
going anywhere, Max.

728
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,969
You promised.

729
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:54,039

- Rudy!

750
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,400
What are you doing?

751
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,608
Spying on you, obviously.

752
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:51,291
Give me that!

753
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:56,450
So, let me guess. You forgot
where the front door was.

754
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:00,683
I've got to hand it to you,
Saumensch, you've got guts...

755
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,799
<i>stealing from the Bürgermeister.</i>

756
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,479
Keep it down.

757
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,126
I'm not stealing.
I'm borrowing.

758
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,759
Whatever you are "borrowing"...

759
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,439
I just wish you let me in on it.

760
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:11,839
It's not what you think.

761
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,319
Then...

762
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:14,851
What is it?

763
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:18,164
I'm borrowing books.
That's all.

764
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,759
Books? Are you nuts?

765
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:23,119
We are starving out here
and you're stealing books?

766
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,526
Stop using that word.

767
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,279
How about food? Did you ever even
think of looking in the kitchen?

768
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:29,481
<i>Nein.</i>

769
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,842
We could have planned this
better if you told me.

770
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,999
I'm sorry. I couldn't.

771
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,921
You know, for a best friend,
you keep a lot to yourself.

772
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:44,044
What's that supposed to mean?

773
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,291
Who's Max?

774
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:49,641
Who is he?

775
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:51,641
Liesel!

776
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,368
Tell me what's going on!

777
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:01,884
Tell me, Saumensch, who is he?

778
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,688
Is he your boyfriend?

779
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,371
What?

780
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,560
Is that what you think?

781
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:11,291
Then what?

782
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,091
Tell me, who is he?

783
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,879
I can't.

784
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,320
Why not?

785
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,241
It's a secret.

786
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,411
You don't trust me?

787
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,401
It's not like that, Rudy.
I can't.

788
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:28,085
If I...

789
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:32,526
If I told you, I'd have to go away.

790
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:36,091
Papa would have to go away.

791
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:39,921
God knows what would happen to him.

792
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:42,365
"Him"?

793
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:45,968
You're hiding someone?

794
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,365
You're hiding someone, aren't you?

795
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:51,921
Liesel!

796
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,328
One spit, "Yes."
Two spits, "No."

797
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,641
I knew it.

798
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:09,042
No one can know, Rudy.

799
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,679
I mean it.

800
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:12,564
You can trust me.

801
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,125
Don't worry.

802
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,404
I won't tell anybody.

803
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,529
You won't tell anyone what?

804
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,406
Hello, Steiner.
Hello, <i>Dummkopf.</i>

805
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:28,804
What's that behind your back?

806
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,480
Give it to me.

807
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:32,999
Leave him alone!

808
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,361
I said, give it to me!

809
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:37,961
Give it to me!

810
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,439
What was that?
What was it?

811
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,847
None of your business, Deutscher.

812
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,727
Leave him!

813
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:57,765
You're done for, Steiner.

814
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,479
I'm reporting you.

815
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:03,490
For what?
Having a diary?

816
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,407
I know you're up to something.

817
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:15,801
Come on!

818
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,041
Come on!

819
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:28,839
What are you doing?

820
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:31,884
I know where it is!
I watched it!

821
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:35,727
It's freezing, Rudy.
You'll die in there.

822
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,166
Rudy!

823
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:45,686
Rudy?

824
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,401
Rudy!

825
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,561
Rudy?

826
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,322
Rudy, I can't swim!

827
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:58,480
Rudy!

828
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,640
Please!

829
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,445
I got it!

830
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:07,766
Rudy!

831
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,925
I thought you were...

832
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,761
Never mind.

833
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,004
Trust me now?

834
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,199
<i>Ja.</i>

835
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,999
Then, how about that kiss?

836
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,601
Come on.
You're going to freeze.

837
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:40,039
Good night...

838
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,844
book thief.

839
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:48,005
Good night, fish.

840
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:10,729
I told Rudy.

841
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,129
Here, come on!
I'm here!

842
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:32,771
Look!

843
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,286
What are they doing?

844
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:40,490
Checking basements. They checked
my cousin's last night.

845
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,201
For what?

846
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,768
Can we get on with it now?

847
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,446
Come on!

848
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,329
Here! Pass it!

849
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:55,841
Are you nuts?

850
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:05,361
I have to go inside.

851
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:06,839
Oh, great.

852
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,041
She's hurt.

853
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,486
Never stopped her before.

854
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:11,286
I'm fine.

855
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,679
Mama!
Why are you shouting?

856
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:22,839
They're coming.

857
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:23,999
Who?

858
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,725
They're checking basements.

859
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:34,885
Hans, come quickly!

860
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:36,839
What is it?
Somebody is coming.

861
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,804
They are checking basements.

862
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,999
We have to hide him.

863
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,248
Get him up here, under the bed.

864
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,159
Max!

865
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,407
Max!

866
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,891
Come on. Come on.

867
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:56,209
So, do they give you a gun
when you join the army?

868
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:57,687
Mama!

869
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:00,926
Oh, my God.

870
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,409
Hans, leave that!

871
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,763
Wolfy. What a surprise.
How are you?

872
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,399
You want Hans?

873
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,679
Hans!

874
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:20,399
<i>Nein, nein, nein.</i> We're just
checking people's basements.

875
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,079
Oh, Liesel,
will you get <i>Herr</i> Edel...

876
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,079
a glass of water?
No need.

877
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,520
This shouldn't take a second.

878
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,359
You should bandage that.

879
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:33,239
Oh, my God, Liesel! Ja!
Oh, would you do me a favor...

880
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:35,999
and get me the medicine chest?
It's just on that...

881
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,361
Where is the man trap?

882
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:39,639
The what?

883
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,046
The door to your basement.

884
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:44,679
Ah!

885
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:46,359
Wolfa.

886
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:48,562
I heard you were coming.
I've been working, tidying up.

887
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:51,926
Heard from who?

888
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,089
Who was it collecting our washing?

889
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,439
Frau Schneider.

890
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:59,279
Frau Schneider, ja.
She mentioned it.

891
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:00,527
Come.

892
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,559
Is there a light in here?

893
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:15,330
Ja, of course.

894
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:18,571
I should probably
throw most of this stuff out.

895
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:22,119
You wouldn't believe what we
find in some people's basements.

896
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,288
Oh, it wouldn't surprise me.

897
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,919
Liesel, she is always
playing down here.

898
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:29,726
I keep telling her to
get out in the fresh air.

899
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,367
What is this about, anyway?

900
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:58,521
What's this?

901
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:08,121
My brushes.

902
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,282
You should look after them better.

903
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:17,359
Liesel, you know,
she never listens to me.

904
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:26,160
Still no work, eh, Hans?

905
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:28,130
Not a lot.

906
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:33,042
You should have taken my
advice and joined the party.

907
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,199
Then your wife wouldn't
have to break her back...

908
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:38,051
washing people's
underwear to feed you.

909
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:42,242
Isn't that right, Rosa?

910
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,526
<i>Ja.</i>

911
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,924
What's wrong with you?

912
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:51,879
I've never heard you
turn down an opportunity...

913
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:53,684
to give this one some lip.

914
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:56,441
Well...

915
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:01,768
if the Saukerl would get off
his lazy backside and help...

916
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,719
then maybe I would have the energy

917
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:06,400
to give him all the lip
that he deserves.

918
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:14,968
I don't know how you live with her.

919
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,760
Neither do I.

920
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:25,042
Never too late to join, Hans.

921
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,239
So, how's our basement?

922
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:35,839
Perfectly useless.
The ceiling is too low.

923
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,239
What for?

924
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:40,125
Air raid shelters.
Every street has to have one.

925
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:41,679
You should be more careful.

926
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:43,211
<i>Ja, Herr</i> Edel.

927
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:55,605
Hans...

928
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:01,171
What if he does die?

929
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:06,604
We can't just leave him there.

930
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:13,250
The smell will give us away.

931
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:19,686
Hans, I'm afraid.

932
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:24,128
Look, if it happens...

933
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:26,968
if he dies...

934
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:31,366
we'll simply have to find a way.

935
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:35,329
He's not dead yet.

936
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,925
All right?

937
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:01,519
Frau Hubermann?

938
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,609
I need to speak to Liesel.

939
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,762
Of course. Liesel?

940
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:13,239
Ow!

941
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:15,159
What did you do with it,
you little thief?

942
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:16,199
What, Mama?

943
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:17,559
Don't "what" me.

944
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,199
I have told you a hundred times

945
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,448
to leave that thing alone,
but do you listen?

946
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,367
Back to work.

947
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:34,925
I'm sorry.

948
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:37,603
Mama, what is it?

949
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:41,765
It's Max, isn't it?

950
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:51,967
He said that this belongs to you.

951
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:56,760
Who said?

952
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,719
He woke up.

953
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:01,919
He's going to live!

954
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:03,167
Mama!

955
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:09,961
Careful.

956
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:15,128
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

957
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:18,239
I couldn't think of
any other way to tell you.

958
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:20,439
I know it's silly of me.
I know.

959
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:22,519
<i>Nein,</i> Mama, it's not.

960
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:23,767
Thank you.

961
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:27,450
Well, you'd better wipe
that smile off your face.

962
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:30,879
Just go back in there...

963
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:34,766
and act like I'm the witch,
you know? Ja?

964
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:36,691
<i>Ja.</i>

965
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:40,165
Just know that...

966
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:44,164
that I...

967
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:48,246
Go on.

968
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:54,527
Do you need a bit of
help with that smile?

969
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,999
If I ever catch you...

970
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,679
doing that sort of
thing again, so help me...

971
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:07,239
I will string you up by your toes.

972
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:09,519
Do you hear me, Saumensch?

973
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,006
Understood?

974
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:39,646
Max!

975
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:47,927
I knew you'd live.

976
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:50,760
With all that reading, you
wouldn't leave me in peace.

977
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:52,879
You heard me?

978
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:54,286
Of course.

979
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:56,481
Thank you.

980
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,400
So...

981
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:13,010
How's Rudy?

982
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,519
I don't know.

983
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,927
Rudy's a pain in the neck.

984
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:29,725
The only thing worse than a boy you
hate is a boy you like, right?

985
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,483
Liesel, it's an air raid!

986
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:39,921
Go on, then.

987
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:41,839
What about you?

988
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,359
I'm here. I'll be fine.

989
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:46,199
It's a basement, isn't it?

990
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:47,639
Did you hear me, Saumensch?

991
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:48,966
Ja, Mama.

992
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:22,483
<i>While 10,000 souls hid their
heads in fear and trembled...</i>

993
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:27,044
<i>one Jew thanked God for the
stars that blessed his eyes.</i>

994
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:55,999
It's all I have.

995
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,326
I'm sorry.

996
01:30:57,680 --> 01:31:00,531
I was saving it for
my husband's return, but...

997
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:02,848
Thank you. Very much.

998
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:19,079
He's a Jew.

999
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:20,479
They found his birth certificate.

1000
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,842
He's a "Lehman" with one not two.

1001
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,881
Please!

1002
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:28,644
My son is in the army!

1003
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,441
He's fighting on the front!

1004
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,399
Please.
In the car!

1005
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:37,766
Please!

1006
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:43,361
You know me.

1007
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:45,001
Please!

1008
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:47,999
You know me! Please!

1009
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,565
I'm German!

1010
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:51,961
Please...

1011
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,806
I've known this man my
whole life. We all have.

1012
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,571
He's a good person.

1013
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:57,967
What's your name?

1014
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,483
Hans Hubermann.

1015
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:09,168
Please! He's a good man.
Get back!

1016
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:10,641
Papa!

1017
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:12,801
Papa!

1018
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:15,201
Liesel!

1019
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:36,126
Rudy!

1020
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,161
Rudy.

1021
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:51,119
Keep still.

1022
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:53,322
What was I thinking?

1023
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:56,488
He took my name.

1024
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:01,119
Christ on the cross,
what have I done?

1025
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:06,643
I've ruined us!
I've ruined us!

1026
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:09,599
I'm sorry, Rosa.

1027
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,689
I'm sorry.

1028
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,564
I don't understand.

1029
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:24,921
What did he do so wrong?

1030
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,844
He reminded people
of their humanity.

1031
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:33,924
Can't he apologize?

1032
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,645
To who?

1033
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:38,641
Hitler?

1034
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,999
Will they take him away?

1035
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,247
I don't know.

1036
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,486
But...

1037
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:51,161
if they come and find me here...

1038
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:54,044
they'll take all of you away.

1039
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:00,604
No, Max.

1040
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:04,044
I have to, Liesel.

1041
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,486
I'm sorry.

1042
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,090
But you promised.

1043
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,244
It's for your own good.

1044
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:16,611
For your family.

1045
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:19,928
But you're my family.

1046
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,967
You've kept me alive, Liesel.

1047
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,719
Don't ever forget that.

1048
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:41,079
I can't lose someone else.

1049
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:43,487
I'm not lost to you, Liesel.

1050
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:46,923
You'll always be able
to find me in your words.

1051
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,648
That's where I'll live on.

1052
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:56,686
Max...

1053
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:59,490
please.

1054
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:03,010
Thank you.

1055
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:11,800
Here.

1056
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:15,689
It's two blankets
and a pair of socks.

1057
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,999
And a nice piece of cheese
that I've been saving.

1058
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,486
Rosa...

1059
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:20,921
It's yours.

1060
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:19,599
Come. Liesel.

1061
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:21,370
Leave her.

1062
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:43,921
Hans?

1063
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:47,844
I'll get my coat.

1064
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:58,443
You are <i>Herr Steiner?</i>

1065
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:03,886
What?

1066
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:07,447
I'm here to talk
about your son, Rudy.

1067
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,360
Rudy Steiner.

1068
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,728
He lives next door.

1069
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:15,209
What do you want with him?

1070
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,921
He's been selected
for elite training.

1071
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,484
He starts in the summer.

1072
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:42,411
I'm sorry, Barbra.

1073
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,210
Hans Hubermann?

1074
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:33,051
What's "conscripted"?

1075
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:16,359
Look how you've grown.

1076
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:18,403
I had not noticed.

1077
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:21,199
I will miss you.

1078
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:23,359
Everyone's leaving.

1079
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:24,679
Even Rudy.

1080
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:27,199
Rudy is going to be fine.

1081
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:30,839
Look after your Mama, ja? She's not
as strong as she makes out.

1082
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:32,199
I know.

1083
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:33,731
Good girl.

1084
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,090
Papa?

1085
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:50,365
Come home.

1086
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:57,121
What do you think?

1087
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:02,084
The shoes let you down.

1088
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:05,525
And the face.

1089
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:07,361
Coming?

1090
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:09,525
Where are you going?

1091
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:13,006
Isn't it obvious?
I'm running away.

1092
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:20,559
Have you thought this through?

1093
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:22,125
<i>Ja.</i>

1094
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:24,519
I don't want to die.

1095
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:27,610
There.
All thought through.

1096
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:31,959
Rudy, where are you going to stay?

1097
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:34,925
"You"? What about "we"?

1098
01:41:35,480 --> 01:41:37,879
I didn't think
you were this serious.

1099
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:39,206
What do you call this?

1100
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:42,490
Packed lunch?

1101
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:46,449
Is there anything in there
besides your soccer ball?

1102
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,642
I miss my dad.

1103
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:03,171
I don't even know
if he's alive.

1104
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:10,523
I'm not ready.

1105
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:14,644
I want to grow up before I die.

1106
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:18,246
So did my brother.

1107
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:22,926
I'm sorry.

1108
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:27,839
I didn't ask for this.

1109
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,610
Who would?

1110
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:34,442
I hate Hitler.

1111
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:36,006
Me, too.

1112
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:41,362
I hate Hitler!

1113
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,488
I hate Hitler!

1114
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:49,279
I hate Hitler!
Hitler is a monkey's ass!

1115
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:50,970
Stick you, Hitler!

1116
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:04,643
You're all I've got, Rudy.

1117
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:10,766
Let's go home.

1118
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:58,439
<i>The bombs were coming thicker now.</i>

1119
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:01,319
<i>It's probably fair to say...</i>

1120
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:05,889
<i>that no one was able to serve
the fuhrer as loyally as me.</i>

1121
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:50,882
There once was
a ghost of a boy...

1122
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:54,605
who liked to live
in the shadows of things...

1123
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:57,599
so he wouldn't frighten people.

1124
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,723
What was that?
Who's speaking?

1125
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:03,159
What are you doing?

1126
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:05,079
Telling a story.

1127
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:06,359
Why?

1128
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:07,607
Whose boy?

1129
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:09,719
She's telling a story.

1130
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:10,921
Speak up.

1131
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:13,647
Start again.

1132
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:19,199
There once was a ghost of a boy...

1133
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:21,559
who liked to live in the shadows,

1134
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:23,967
so he wouldn't frighten people.

1135
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:30,402
His job was to wait for his
sister, who was still alive.

1136
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:34,519
She wasn't afraid of the dark...

1137
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:38,441
because she knew
that's where her brother was.

1138
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:42,005
Go on.

1139
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:47,090
At night, when darkness
came to her room...

1140
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:50,559
she would tell her brother
about the day.

1141
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:55,239
She would remind him how the
sun felt on his skin...

1142
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:57,759
and what the air
felt like to breathe...

1143
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:05,764
Or how snow felt on his tongue.
And that reminded her...

1144
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:08,481
that she was still alive.

1145
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:24,840
Gentlemen...

1146
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:27,165
how is everybody?

1147
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:30,559
Look at this one. They are starting
to conscript grandfathers.

1148
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:36,244
Hey, old man. Old man,
are they your own teeth?

1149
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:06,159
Together, they sat in the forest...

1150
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:09,479
and watched the sun rise.

1151
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:12,879
And as he disappeared
back into the shadows...

1152
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:16,562
she waved goodbye
for the last time.

1153
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:20,724
Oh, Liesel.

1154
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:05,961
Max?

1155
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,241
Max?

1156
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:10,206
Max!

1157
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:16,487
Max!

1158
01:48:17,320 --> 01:48:18,919
<i>Saumensch!</i>

1159
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:20,839
What are you up to?

1160
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:22,087
Max?

1161
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:24,969
Liesel!
Max?

1162
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:27,644
Do you know Max?
Liesel!

1163
01:48:28,040 --> 01:48:29,321
Do you know Max?

1164
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:33,411
Max?

1165
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:38,090
Do you know Max?

1166
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:47,483
Get out of here, you stupid girl!

1167
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:50,847
Liesel!

1168
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:53,801
I won't forget you.
I won't forget you.

1169
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:55,559
I won't forget you.

1170
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:57,649
I won't forget you, Max.

1171
01:48:58,320 --> 01:48:59,567
Liesel!

1172
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:06,847
Go out!

1173
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:08,641
Liesel!

1174
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:23,731
You're too much like your
father, you know that?

1175
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:28,041
What's wrong with that?

1176
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:32,965
Nothing.

1177
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:42,439
Hey, Saumensch, want to play?

1178
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:44,768
<i>Nein,</i> not today.

1179
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:47,639
Then let's steal something.

1180
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:50,241
I don't steal. I borrow.

1181
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:55,727
Then let's go borrow Franz Deutscher's
bike und get out of here.

1182
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:57,961
Can't you see I'm reading?

1183
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:00,691
Are you still angry with me?

1184
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:03,760
For what?

1185
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:07,404
Saving you.

1186
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:09,530
<i>Nein,</i> Rudy.

1187
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:11,000
You're very brave.

1188
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:28,531
Papa!

1189
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:32,091
You're home!

1190
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:41,364
What is it, my girl?

1191
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:48,605
My girl.

1192
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:50,845
My girl.

1193
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,567
It's nice to hear you play.

1194
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:19,649
I can't hear properly.

1195
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:23,324
I'm going to bed.

1196
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:26,647
Don't stay up too late, you two.

1197
01:51:39,160 --> 01:51:41,761
Your mama told me what you did.

1198
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:47,010
I shouldn't have.

1199
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:49,203
Maybe you had to.

1200
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:55,041
I keep thinking about Max.

1201
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:57,200
Wondering where he is.

1202
01:51:58,440 --> 01:52:00,210
Me, too.

1203
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:04,208
I'm not sure what it all meant.

1204
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:07,802
Everything he went through.

1205
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:10,488
Everything we did.

1206
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:15,966
We were just being people.

1207
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:18,531
That's what people do.

1208
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:22,766
Liesel...

1209
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:25,848
you are all grown up.

1210
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:35,839
<i>All I have learned is that
life makes no promises.</i>

1211
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:38,008
<i>So I had better get started.</i>

1212
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:41,206
<i>I have always
tried to ignore it...</i>

1213
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:44,729
<i>but I know this all
started with a train...</i>

1214
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:48,249
<i>and some snow...</i>

1215
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:50,885
<i>and my brother.</i>

1216
01:52:53,880 --> 01:52:57,801
<i>Outside the car, the world was
thrown inside a snow-shaker.</i>

1217
01:52:57,880 --> 01:53:00,119
<i>Und on a place
called Heaven Street...</i>

1218
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:04,039
<i>a man with an accordion heart und
a woman cloaked in thunder...</i>

1219
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:05,844
<i>waited for their new daughter.</i>

1220
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:17,399
<i>He lived under our stairs like
a quiet owl with no wings...</i>

1221
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:20,604
<i>until the sun forgot
what his face was.</i>

1222
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:29,279
<i>The book floated
down the river...</i>

1223
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:33,246
<i>like a red fish being chased
by a yellow-haired boy.</i>

1224
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:46,251
<i>For Max, who gave me eyes.</i>

1225
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:15,087
Good night, Your Majesty.

1226
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:30,479
<i>I've always quite liked the
image of me with a sickle and cape.</i>

1227
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:33,199
<i>Dark and formidable.</i>

1228
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:37,644
<i>Unfortunately, I'm far more
ordinary and commonplace.</i>

1229
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:43,525
<i>No one intended to destroy
a street named after Heaven.</i>

1230
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:46,759
<i>It was a misread on a map.</i>

1231
01:54:46,760 --> 01:54:49,281
<i>No sirens that evening.</i>

1232
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:53,007
<i>First were Rudy's brothers.</i>

1233
01:54:56,600 --> 01:54:59,371
<i>I read their simple dreams.</i>

1234
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:06,086
<i>Then, I kissed his mother.</i>

1235
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:12,605
<i>And stole the meanness
from Franz Deutscher's heart.</i>

1236
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:20,485
<i>Rosa, I caught mid-snore.</i>

1237
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:24,719
<i>I could swear I heard
her call me a Saukerl.</i>

1238
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:30,609
<i>Then I felt her regrets for not
sharing more of her very big heart.</i>

1239
01:55:31,240 --> 01:55:36,446
<i>As for Hans, his soul was
lighter than a child's.</i>

1240
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:40,685
<i>I felt his itch for one last
tune on his accordion...</i>

1241
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:43,720
<i>and heard his final thought...</i>

1242
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:47,324
<i>"Liesel."</i>

1243
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:41,726
Over here!

1244
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:49,245
Just over.

1245
01:56:57,120 --> 01:56:58,367
Your hand.

1246
01:57:11,080 --> 01:57:13,521
Mama? Papa?

1247
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:52,811
Papa?

1248
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:59,965
Papa.

1249
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:27,526
Rudy?

1250
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:44,928
<i>Saumensch.</i>

1251
01:58:46,040 --> 01:58:47,401
Liesel.

1252
01:58:51,800 --> 01:58:53,159
I need to tell you...

1253
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:54,850
Don't speak.

1254
01:58:55,520 --> 01:58:57,609
I need to say it.

1255
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:03,241
I...

1256
01:59:07,280 --> 01:59:08,641
Rudy?

1257
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:11,441
Rudy, nein.

1258
01:59:12,280 --> 01:59:13,925
Rudy, wake up.

1259
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:16,119
Rudy, <i>nein!</i>

1260
01:59:16,120 --> 01:59:18,971
Wake up, Rudy!
Rudy, wake up!

1261
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:21,330
Rudy, kiss me.

1262
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:31,488
<i>Rudy, his soul just
rolled into my arms.</i>

1263
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:53,729
<i>In my job, I am always finding
humans at their best...</i>

1264
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,079
<i>and their worst.</i>

1265
02:00:56,080 --> 02:00:59,568
<i>I see their ugliness,
and their beauty...</i>

1266
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:04,125
<i>and I wonder how the
same thing can be both.</i>

1267
02:01:56,680 --> 02:01:57,927
Liesel!

1268
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:02,120
Max!

1269
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:17,839
<i>I have seen a great many things.</i>

1270
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:21,359
<i>I've attended all the
world's worst disasters...</i>

1271
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:24,530
<i>and worked for the greatest of villains.</i>

1272
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:28,129
<i>And I've seen the greatest wonders.</i>

1273
02:03:28,240 --> 02:03:31,239
<i>But it's still like I said it was.</i>

1274
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:34,171
<i>No one lives forever.</i>

1275
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:45,279
<i>When I finally came for Liesel...</i>

1276
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:47,879
<i>I took selfish pleasure
in the knowledge</i>

1277
02:03:47,880 --> 02:03:51,607
<i>that she had lived
her 90 years so wisely.</i>

1278
02:03:58,280 --> 02:04:02,559
<i>By then, her stories
had touched many souls.</i>

1279
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:05,889
<i>Some of whom I came
to know in passing.</i>

1280
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:16,726
<i>Max, whose friendship lasted
almost as long as Liesel.</i>

1281
02:04:17,400 --> 02:04:19,250
<i>Almost.</i>

1282
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:24,159
<i>In her final thoughts...</i>

1283
02:04:24,160 --> 02:04:28,763
<i>she saw the long list of lives
that merged with hers.</i>

1284
02:04:29,280 --> 02:04:30,959
<i>Her three children.</i>

1285
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:33,039
<i>Her grandchildren.</i>

1286
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:35,288
<i>Her husband.</i>

1287
02:04:35,680 --> 02:04:38,479
<i>Among them, lit like lanterns...</i>

1288
02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:40,879
<i>were Hans and Rosa...</i>

1289
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:42,439
<i>her brother...</i>

1290
02:04:42,440 --> 02:04:47,680
<i>and the boy whose hair remained
the color of lemons forever.</i>

1291
02:04:50,160 --> 02:04:51,999
<i>I wanted to tell the book thief</i>

1292
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:53,879
<i>she was one of the few souls...</i>

1293
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:57,880
<i>that made me wonder
what it was to live.</i>

1294
02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:02,039
<i>But in the end,
there were no words.</i>

1295
02:05:02,040 --> 02:05:04,004
<i>Only peace.</i>

1296
02:05:04,840 --> 02:05:08,039
<i>The only truth I truly know...</i>

1297
02:05:08,040 --> 02:05:12,882
<i>is that I am haunted by humans.</i>
