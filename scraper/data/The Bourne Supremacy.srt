have wandered a little
past your pay grade.

193
00:25:00,521 --> 00:25:02,227
That's a warrant
from Director Marshall

granting me unrestricted access

exactly what you're doing.

Conklin had these guys wound so
tight, they were Bound to snap.

215
00:25:49,235 --> 00:25:50,941
Bourne was his number one.

The guy went for a job, screwed
the op, never came Back.

Conklin couldn 't fix it, couldn
't find Bourne, couldn 't adjust.

It all went sideways.

during a wire transfer
through Moscow.

In the investigation
that followed

242
00:27:25,287 --> 00:27:28,745
we were contacted by a Russian
politician, Vladimir Neski.

243
00:27:28,832 --> 00:27:32,700
Neski claimed we had a leak and that
we'd been ripped off by one of our own.

And were we?

We never found out.

- His wife.

to have access to
the Neski murder files.

another bite at the apple.

of our own, Jason Bourne.

Now I know Treadstone's not a
very popular subject around here,

254
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:02,653
but we found some interesting
things when we dug a little deeper.

255
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,231
This is Conklin's
personal computer.

256
00:28:05,326 --> 00:28:08,944
His Treadstone files are bloated
with code keys and case files

257
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:11,120
that he neither needed
nor had clearance for.

we found a deleted file

to a bank in Zurich.

He was up to something.

266
00:28:27,514 --> 00:28:28,845
This is supposed
to be definitive?

267
00:28:28,932 --> 00:28:31,264
PAMELA: What's definitive is that
I just lost two people in Berlin.

268
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:33,433
So what's your theory? Conklin's
reaching out from the grave

to protect his good name?
The man is dead.

Conklin were in business together,

that Bourne's still involved

and that whatever information
I was trying to buy in Berlin

277

out from hiding to kill again.

the minute he left Treadstone,

336
00:33:09,081 --> 00:33:11,743
he's killed and eluded every single
person that you've sent to find him.

Jason Bourne and that makes you an expert?

inept to do the last time around.

destroy any more of this agency.

we lost the Neski files.

about Bourne's movements.

with total control for all those years.

We should be
a step ahead of him.

Find Jason Bourne.

This is Jason Bourne.

Bourne?
It"s Bourne.

We need 90 seconds to
triangulate his position.

What do you want?

BOURNE: Are you running Treadstone?

490
00:49:34,376 --> 00:49:36,492
Treadstone was closed down
two years ago.

491

You know that.

Then who's planning
the missions now?

There are no missions.
It's over.

Who?

505
00:50:34,183 --> 00:50:37,516
There was a girl in Paris.
She was part of the program.

She used to handle logistics.

her right in the middle of everything.

This is a security nightmare.

There is no way we are
going to get her covered.

You put snipers on the roof and it'll
scare him off, and I need answers.

ABOTT: You can't really
believe he wants to come in.

PAMELA: He knows something
about the Neski case.

chance to find out what it is.

Don"t be a fool.
Not when we"re this close.

Are we talking about protecting
Nicky or killing Bourne?

527
00:51:38,914 --> 00:51:40,275
We're talking
about killing Bourne.

528
00:51:40,332 --> 00:51:41,868
We're talking about
the next dead body.

529

It might be Nicky.
It will be someone.

You're not hearing me. Bourne
dead gives me nothing.

ABOTT: Can I talk to
you privately?

532
00:51:58,974 --> 00:52:00,635
- What?
- I know how you're feeling.

533
00:52:00,726 --> 00:52:03,559
You lost two men in Berlin, and
you want it to mean something.

534
00:52:03,646 --> 00:52:05,853
But nothing Bourne gives you
will bring your men back.

535
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:08,352
Nothing in those files makes
their sacrifice worthwhile.

tried to make a Buy
off of one of her ops.

- And you got to him before we did.

- I killed him?
- You left a print.

And they were partial prints
that trace Back to Treadstone.

What kind of files?
