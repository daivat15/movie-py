1
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,014
Take off that beanie.

2
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,475
Hey, we're supposed to
wear it until homecoming.

3
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,477
Don't be a fruit, okay?

4
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:28,898
Okay.

5
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,740
Hi, there.

6
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,200
Doug Neidermeyer,
Omega membership chairman.

7
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,077
Larry Kroger. This...

8
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,748
This is my roommate,
Kent Dorfman.

9
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,751
Hi, there.
Doug Neidermeyer.

10
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,670
And these are
our nametag hostesses

11
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,755
Mandy Pepperidge
and Babs Jansen.

12
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,174
- Hi, there, Kent. Hi, Larry.
- Hi.

13
00:02:55,484 --> 00:02:56,759
Welcome to Omega House.

14
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:57,969
Thank you. Nice to...

15
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:01,764
Why don't we just go inside
and meet some of the guys, huh?

16
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,355
A wimp and a blimp.

17
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,484
There are a lot of
great guys here tonight,

18
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,945
so don't feel you
have to meet everybody.

19
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:22,326
We just want you to enjoy
yourselves while you're here.

20
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:24,687
Well, Chip, I think you'll find

21
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,289
that Omega House
has more activities

22
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,249
than most of the other
fraternities on campus

23
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,876
and they're far superior,
I think...

24
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,461
- Mandy.
- Hi. Oh, right there.

25
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,508
Hi, there, fellas.
Like you to meet Ken and Lonnie.

26
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:38,759
Larry.

27
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,221
- Ken, Lonnie, I'd like you to meet...
- Larry.

28
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:46,976
Mohamet, Jugdish,
Sidney, and Clayton.

29
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:50,479
Now just grab a seat,
and make yourselves at home

30
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:54,483
and don't be shy about helping
yourselves to punch and cookies.

31
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,668
Now, I'm not going to say that
Omega's the best house on campus

32
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,420
but a lot of outstanding guys

33
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,965
figure they'll pledge Omega,
or they won't pledge at all.

34
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,927
We do have more than
our share of campus leaders.

35
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:24,513
Something that never looks bad
on your permanent record, Chip.

36
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,681
Well, sure.

37
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:30,186
Everybody I talk to says Omega's
the best, but I hate to seem

38
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,688
you know, pushy.

39
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,274
Let the unacceptable
candidates worry about that

40
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:38,444
because after tonight
they're... You are...

41
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:40,488
Kent.

42
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:43,324
I'm Greg Marmalard,
President of Omega House.

43
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,689
And I'd like you to meet my friends,
Mandy Pepperidge...

44
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,661
- Hello.
- Hi.

45
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,372
- We already met.
- ...and Chip Diller.

46
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,290
- How are you?
- Hi. How are you?

47
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,835
And over there is Terry Auerback,
captain of the swim team

48
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,838
and that's Carl Phillips, editor
of The Daily Faberian

49
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,257
and Clayton

50
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,804
Sidney, Jugless,
Mohamet, Lonnie...

51
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,263
Yeah, we already met.

52
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,974
Oh, super!

53
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:11,102
Then you'll have lots
to talk about, huh? Yeah.

54
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,692
I don't know, Larry. I don't think
you're trying very hard.

55
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,318
I hate this.

56
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:20,611
Look, no sweat.

57
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:23,406
My brother Fred was a Delta.
That makes me a legacy.

58
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,658
They gotta take me.
It's like their law.

59
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,785
Don't worry. I'll put
in a good word for you.

60
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,830
Great. I heard Delta's
the worst house on campus.

61
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,262
Excuse me, sir.
Is this the Delta house?

62
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,513
Sure.

63
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,142
Come on in.

64
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,594
Grab a brew.
Don't cost nothing.

65
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,686
I've never seen anything like
this before. I'll see you later.

66
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:39,148
Down to her underwear.
I had a boner. I know I did.

67
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,001
And bump you $20.

68
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,544
Hi, guys.

69
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,839
I'll see another ten.

70
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,425
You guys playing cards?

71
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,193
You want another beer?

72
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,823
Hi. You want a beer,

73
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,991
- Larry?
- Sure.

74
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,454
Nice fish, huh?

75
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,626
Hi, Larry. I'm Robert Hoover,
Chapter President.

76
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,919
Hi, Robert.

77
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,379
Katy, have you seen Boon?

78
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,131
He disappeared
the minute we got here.

79
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,383
He's probably upstairs
talking to Otter.

80
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,220
No doubt. They're
well-known homosexuals.

81
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:55,266
Have another beer, Larry.
She's just kidding.

82
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,892
Right, Bluto?

83
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,909
You going out tonight, Otter?

84
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:14,994
Uh-huh.

85
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,328
Norma?

86
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,496
No. Let me
give you a hint.

87
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:20,666
She's got a couple
of major-league yabos.

88
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,792
Beverly.

89
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:24,461
No, but you're getting warmer.

90
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,173
Let me give you another hint.
Does this ring a bell?

91
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,718
"Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God!"

92
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,136
Marlene.

93
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,930
Don't tell me you're gonna
pork Marlene Desmond.

94
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,056
Pork?

95
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,184
Gonna hump her brains out,
aren't you?

96
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:42,313
Boon, I anticipate
a deeply religious experience.

97
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,734
Why are you so interested
in my social life? Where's Katy?

98
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,195
Downstairs, pissed off
about something.

99
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,322
She thinks you're an
immature jerk, huh?

100
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,032
Yeah.

101
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,451
I don't take anything seriously.

102
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,293
She'll take this seriously.
Try it.

103
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,378
Hey, are you guys coming down?

104
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:07,504
This thing talk?

105
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:11,217
There happen to be 50 people downstairs
waiting to try and get into this fraternity.

106
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,010
Otter, you are the rush chairman.

107
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,888
I think you should be
present at the rush party.

108
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,606
Hi. My name is Kent Dorfman.

109
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:34,740
Hey, Eric Stratton, Rush Chairman.
Damn glad to meet you.

110
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:37,868
D-Day.

111
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:41,497
Hi. Eric Stratton, Rush Chairman.
Damn glad to meet you.

112
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,167
Hi. That was Eric Stratton, Rush Chairman.
He was damn glad to meet you.

113
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,419
Oh, Larry. Good.
I see you've met D-Day.

114
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,798
Good. You're having a nice
time. That's good. Good.

115
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,895
Hey, Eric Stratton, Rush Chairman.
Damn glad to meet you.

116
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,897
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice tie.

117
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,649
Is that a clip-on,
by any chance?

118
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,484
Boon, come on over
and check this out.

119
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,820
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Pardon me. Excuse me.

120
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,947
Pardon me. Excuse me.
Excuse me. Pardon me.

121
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,867
Oh, 90% rayon. Very nice.

122
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:23,414
Hi, boys, having a good time,
I hope? Excuse me, one second.

123
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,791
- Did your mother buy that for you?
- Yeah.

124
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,503
Kent is a legacy, Otter.
His brother was a '59. Fred Dorfman?

125
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,673
He said legacies usually get
asked to pledge automatically.

126
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:36,844
Oh, well, usually, unless the pledge in
question turns out to be a real closet case.

127
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,138
- Like Fred.
- My brother.

128
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,431
Kent, come on over here.

129
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,641
- I like the tie.
- Great tie, don't you think?

130
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:43,976
Katy!

131
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,566
Hi. Eric Stratton, Rush Chairman.
Damn glad to meet you.

132
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,319
Katy.

133
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,989
Katy, Katy, Katy.
Where you going?

134
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,490
Home, Donald.

135
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,700
We just got here.

136
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,660
No, Boon, you just got here.

137
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,996
I've been downstairs for
an hour entertaining some kid

138
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,290
from Pig's Knuckle, Arkansas.

139
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:12,212
Maybe we could drive up to
your folks' place this weekend.

140
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,839
Oh, fabulous.

141
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,966
My car, filled with
your beer buddies

142
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,344
going up to empty my
parents' liquor cabinet.

143
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,137
It's too depressing
to think about.

144
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,388
No.

145
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,309
Just gonna be you and me,
and Otter and another girl.

146
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,188
Is this really what you're gonna do
for the rest of your life?

147
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,231
What do you mean?
I mean, hanging around

148
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,734
with a bunch of animals,
getting drunk every weekend.

149
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:34,860
No.

150
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:38,906
After I graduate,
I'm gonna get drunk every night.

151
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,872
Boon, I think
I'm in love with a retard.

152
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,208
Is he bigger than me?

153
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,138
Greg,

154
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:07,351
what is the worst fraternity
on this campus?

155
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,521
That would be hard to say, sir.

156
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,325
They're each outstanding
in their own way...

157
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:16,527
Cut the horse shit, son.
I got their disciplinary files right here.

158
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:23,242
Who dumped a whole truckload
of Fizzies into the swim meet?

159
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:28,122
Who delivered the medical school
cadavers to the alumni dinner?

160
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:32,000
Every Halloween, the trees
are filled with underwear.

161
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,963
Every spring,
the toilets explode.

162
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:39,174
You're talking about Delta, sir.

163
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:42,886
Of course I'm talking
about Delta, you twerp!

164
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,014
This year,
it's gonna be different.

165
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,767
This year, we're going to grab
the bull by the balls

166
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,770
and kick those punks off campus.

167
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:55,441
What do you intend to do, sir?
Delta's already on probation.

168
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,525
They are?

169
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,609
Yes, sir.

170
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:58,986
Oh.

171
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,824
Then as of this moment,
they're on double secret probation.

172
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,285
Double secret probation, sir?

173
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:10,539
There is a little-known codicil in
the Faber College constitution

174
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,917
which gives the Dean unlimited
power to preserve order

175
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,170
in time of campus emergency.

176
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:20,340
Find me a way to
revoke Delta's charter.

177
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,552
You live next door.

178
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,471
Put Neidermeyer on it.

179
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,098
He's a sneaky little shit,
just like you, right?

180
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:33,479
The time has come for someone
to put his foot down

181
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,690
and that foot is me.

182
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,320
Larry Kroger. All in favor.

183
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,573
Who cares?
We need the dues.

184
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,659
Good. Larry Kroger is now
pledged to Delta Tau Chi.

185
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,620
Next slide, please, D-Day.

186
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,842
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Just settle down.

187
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:07,262
This is Kent Dorfman.
He's a legacy from Harrisburg.

188
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:12,142
Oh, come on, now.
Okay.

189
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:14,978
Now wait.
Okay.

190
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,440
Okay, this guy is a real zero.
That's true.

191
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,694
Let's just think back
to when you guys were freshmen.

192
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:26,323
Boon, you had a face like
a pepperoni pizza, right?

193
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:28,617
And Stork here.

194
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,787
Everybody thought
the Stork was brain damaged.

195
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,748
I, myself, was so obnoxious

196
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,377
the seniors used to
beat me up once a week.

197
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,921
So this guy is a total loser?

198
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,467
Well, let me tell you
the story of another loser.

199
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:52,849
Get up!

200
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,480
Let's go! On your feet!

201
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,652
I... State your name.

202
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,321
I... state your name.

203
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:13,078
Do hereby pledge
allegiance to the frat.

204
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:17,291
With liberty and
fraternity for all.

205
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,584
Amen.

206
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,419
Sergeant at Arms.

207
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,088
Do your duty.

208
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:30,512
From now on,
your Delta Tau Chi name is Weasel.

209
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,517
From now on,
your name is Mothball.

210
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:41,148
Kroger,
your Delta Tau Chi name is Pinto.

211
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,191
Why Pinto?
Why not?

212
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,486
What's my Delta Tau Chi name?

213
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,616
Dorfman, I've given this
a lot of thought.

214
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:54,786
From now on,
your name is Flounder.

215
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,540
Flounder?

216
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,591
We now consecrate
the bond of obedience.

217
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,975
Assume the position.

218
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:12,447
Thank you, sir!
May I have another?

219
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,410
Thank you, sir.
May I have another?

220
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,580
Now what can we say

221
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:26,336
of John Milton's Paradise Lost?

222
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,340
Well, it's a very long poem.

223
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,760
It was written a long
time ago and I'm sure

224
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:36,638
a lot of you have
difficulty understanding

225
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,725
exactly what
Milton was trying to say.

226
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,853
Certainly we know
that he was trying

227
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:47,065
to describe the struggle
between good and evil, right?

228
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:50,902
Okay.

229
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:55,824
The most intriguing character,
as we all know from our reading, was...

230
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,119
Satan.

231
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,750
Now was Milton
trying to tell us

232
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,753
that being bad was
more fun than being good?

233
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:17,554
Okay.

234
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,600
Don't write this down,
but I find Milton

235
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,853
probably as boring
as you find Milton.

236
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:31,193
Mrs. Milton found him boring,
too. He... He's a little bit long-winded.

237
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:35,113
He doesn't translate very well
into our generation

238
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:36,990
and his jokes are terrible.

239
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:42,329
But that does not relieve you from
your responsibility for this material.

240
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:45,040
Now, I'm waiting for
reports from some of you.

241
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,794
Listen, I'm not joking.
This is my job.

242
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,466
Come on, Mandy, honey.
You know I'd tell you.

243
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,803
Are you and Greg doing
the dirty deed or not?

244
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:01,389
Greg doesn't believe
in premarital intercourse.

245
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,059
Too bad.

246
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,978
I think he's just dreamy.

247
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,480
Jumping jacks!

248
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:16,564
And one, two, three, four!

249
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,330
And one, two...

250
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,374
Company, halt!

251
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:35,841
Dress that line.

252
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,609
Dress that line, mister.

253
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,405
Dress that line, soldier.

254
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,116
Mister, hold my mount.

255
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,794
You fat, disgusting slob.

256
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,339
You're a goddamn disgrace!

257
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:18,967
A vicious mother, isn't he?

258
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,178
Yeah. He can't do
that to our pledges.

259
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:24,806
Only we can do that
to our pledges.

260
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,852
Redo those buttons.
Dress that belt buckle.

261
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:34,316
Straighten that cap.
And goddamn it, tuck up those pajamas!

262
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,612
Attention! Eyes front!

263
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:43,491
What's that
on your chest, mister?

264
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:47,495
It's a pledge pin, sir.

265
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,414
A pledge pin?

266
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,625
On your uniform?

267
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,921
Hooked it. Shit.

268
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:05,013
Just tell me, mister,
what fraternity would pledge

269
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,681
a man like you?

270
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,477
It's a Delta pin, sir.

271
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:13,521
Slice.

272
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:23,448
You'll report to the stable tonight
and every night at 1900 hours

273
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,700
and without that pledge pin!

274
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,162
Do you understand?

275
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:39,130
Your left arm is straight,
but you're not keeping your head down.

276
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:42,717
You're all worthless and weak!

277
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,804
Now, drop and give me 20!

278
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,604
Ho! Whoa!

279
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:57,148
Ho.
Get back in rank! Attention!

280
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,734
Always try to hit
through the ball.

281
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,570
Whoa, big fella. Whoa, whoa.

282
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,365
Trooper, whoa...

283
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,206
I gotta work on my game.

284
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,291
No, no, no.
Don't think of it as work.

285
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:18,253
The whole point is
just to enjoy yourself.

286
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,302
Now, I want you to fix Pinto up,
but it's gotta be a very special girl.

287
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,787
Listen. You don't have...
Now, she should be decent-looking

288
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:32,267
but we're willing to trade
looks for a certain kind of

289
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,768
morally casual attitude.

290
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,563
Oh, you mean you want somebody
he can screw on the first date.

291
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,690
Well put. You see,
Pinto's never been laid.

292
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,899
Hey.
What'd I say?

293
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,109
Cut it out.
Look, you guys.

294
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,111
Don't embarrass me
in front of Dave, okay?

295
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:45,363
- He's the only professor I like.
- I know.

296
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,991
Mr. Jennings is
a wonderful teacher.

297
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,662
No, teaching's a way
of paying the rent,

298
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:54,205
until I finish my novel.

299
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:57,292
How long you been
working on it?

300
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,877
Four and a half years.

301
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,254
Must be very good.

302
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,173
It's a piece of shit.

303
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:10,096
Would anybody like
to smoke some pot?

304
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:11,473
Yeah.

305
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:14,434
You ever smoked before?

306
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:16,644
Sure.

307
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,398
When did you ever smoke pot?

308
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,027
I've done a lot of things
you don't know about.

309
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,236
Yeah?

310
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,366
I won't go schizo, will I?

311
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,701
There's a distinct possibility.

312
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,218
Is this right?

313
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:34,472
Just try not to drool quite
so much on the end of it.

314
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:49,737
Hey, hey, Paula

315
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:52,740
I wanna marry you
I wanna marry you

316
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,702
Hey, hey, Paula Hey, hey, Paula

317
00:24:56,328 --> 00:25:00,331
Nobody else could ever do
Nobody else could ever do

318
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,877
You've waited
You've waited so long

319
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,796
For school to be through
For school to get through

320
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:09,632
Be through Get through, Paula

321
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:13,928
I can't wait no more for you
I can't wait no more for you

322
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,096
Okay.

323
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:21,269
So that means that
our whole solar system

324
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:25,023
could be like one tiny atom

325
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:28,651
in the fingernail of
some other giant being.

326
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,363
This is too much.

327
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,991
That means that

328
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:40,121
one tiny atom in my
fingernail could be...

329
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:45,001
Could be one little tiny universe.

330
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,134
Could I buy some pot from you?

331
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:01,851
Whoa!

332
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,585
Give me that.

333
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,384
Yeah.

334
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,302
Yeah, baby.

335
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,596
Good baby, yes.

336
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:41,683
It's all right.
You stupid son of a...

337
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:49,857
Dorfman, for God's sake, what kind
of man hits a defenseless animal?

338
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:53,236
I've got a good mind
to smash your fat face.

339
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,570
Yeah, but...
Now listen up,

340
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:59,158
you nauseating pile of blubber,
your days are numbered here at Faber.

341
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:01,828
You and all your
sick Delta buddies.

342
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:04,706
Meantime,
your ass belongs to me.

343
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:08,001
Now, drop and give me 20!

344
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:09,252
Yes, but...

345
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,837
Hit it!

346
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,925
Oh, Trooper, baby.
Baby, Trooper.

347
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:24,225
Come here, baby. Come here.
Yeah, baby, yeah. Come here.

348
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,687
Yeah, cutie-pie, come on.

349
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:30,773
Yeah.

350
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:35,153
I want these quarters standing
tall by 0900 tomorrow.

351
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:36,612
You got that?

352
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:37,822
Yes, sir.

353
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,580
Brother D-Day.
Brother Bluto.

354
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,417
Do you hate that ying-yang?

355
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,501
Who?

356
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:53,254
Neidermeyer. You hate
his guts, right?

357
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:55,173
I guess so.
You guess so?

358
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,508
Yes, I hate him.
I hate his guts.

359
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,011
Good. Now, we have
an old saying in Delta:

360
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,513
Don't get mad. Get even.

361
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:04,724
Now, what we're gonna do is...

362
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,899
Nice horsey. Good.
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

363
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,406
He's in there.

364
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,117
Oh, boy, is this great?

365
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,995
Now finish it, Flounder.

366
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,622
Are you kidding?

367
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,250
I never shot anything
before in my life.

368
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,043
I thought you hated
Neidermeyer's guts.

369
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:15,128
I do.

370
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,672
And what about that horse?
Is there anything in the world

371
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,091
you hate as much as that horse?

372
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,261
Get it over with, Kent.

373
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,523
Just blanks, right?
Right.

374
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,444
What's going on?

375
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,240
Holy shit!

376
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,659
There were blanks in that gun.

377
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,536
I didn't even
point the gun at him.

378
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:32,455
Holy shit!

379
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,290
There were blanks in that gun!

380
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,666
Maybe he had a heart attack.

381
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,376
Holy shit!

382
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:56,604
If you want the homecoming parade
in my town, you have to pay.

383
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:02,109
Carmine, I don't think it's right that
you should extort money from the college.

384
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:04,695
Look.

385
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,616
As the mayor of Faber,
I've got big responsibilities.

386
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,744
And these parades
are very expensive.

387
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:13,704
You're using my police,

388
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:16,916
my sanitation people,
my three Oldsmobiles.

389
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,127
So, if you mention
extortion again

390
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,589
I'll have your legs broken.

391
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:29,971
Well, I'm sure I can arrange a nice
little honorarium from the student fund.

392
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:33,766
And another thing,

393
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:37,478
you better sit on that zoo
fraternity of yours.

394
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:41,232
I don't want no drunken
riots in my town.

395
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:45,361
Don't worry, Carmine.
I've got those boys just where I want them.

396
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,948
We'll have the best
homecoming parade Faber's ever had.

397
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:19,604
Mandy.

398
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:22,607
Mandy Pepperidge. Well,
I haven't seen you since we...

399
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:23,774
Go away.

400
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,110
I'm sorry. I can
only stay a minute.

401
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,237
Let me buy you some lunch.

402
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:31,907
Oh, you've got your lunch.
Well, how about some milk then?

403
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,160
You got your milk, too.

404
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:37,413
Can I just massage
your thighs while you eat?

405
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,081
Do I have to leave?

406
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:42,001
Is this any way to treat
an intimate friend?

407
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:59,912
I asked you never to speak to
me again. Now will you go away?

408
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:12,925
I do hope we're not interrupting
anything, Mandy, honey.

409
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:14,424
Well, if you must know...

410
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,469
Eric was just leaving.

411
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:16,887
No, I wasn't.

412
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,014
I could make you leave
if you ask me...

413
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:22,309
Bluto! Hey, I think you
know everybody here.

414
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,064
Greg, really, can't you...
No, don't worry.

415
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:29,942
Just keep your hands
and feet away from his mouth.

416
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,320
Don't you have any
respect for yourself?

417
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:38,200
This is absolutely gross.

418
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:41,162
That boy is a P-I-G. Pig.

419
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,794
See if you can guess
what I am now.

420
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,265
I'm a zit. Get it?

421
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,602
All right, you bastard,
let's go. Right here.

422
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:09,815
Come on, Blutarsky!

423
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:31,796
Hey, why don't
we go out tonight?

424
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,174
Otter, don't flatter yourself.
It wasn't that great.

425
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:41,931
Food fight!

426
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,404
Oh, Greg. Look.

427
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:59,573
It's a star. Look.

428
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:02,701
Let's make a wish. Come on.

429
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:06,831
Starlight, star bright...

430
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,791
Hey, wait a minute.
That's not a star.

431
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,918
Oh.
It's moving too fast.

432
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,128
Probably a 707.

433
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:16,131
Those babies really
can move across the sky.

434
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:22,847
Greg, is anything happening yet?

435
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,640
My arm's kind of tired.

436
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:27,601
I'm sorry, Mandy.

437
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:32,106
It's just that thing with the Deltas.
Has me a little distracted.

438
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,190
I know.

439
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:35,442
God knows how they've
molested women.

440
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,322
Anything?

441
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:43,951
Maybe a little faster.

442
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:46,704
Yeah.
How's that?

443
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:48,163
Yeah.
Yeah?

444
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:52,042
I'll bet that Eric Stratton's
lucky he's not in jail.

445
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,794
I'll say.

446
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,796
What?

447
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,257
You'll say what?

448
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,010
I'll say what?

449
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:04,388
You said, "I'll say," when I said that
Eric Stratton should be put in jail.

450
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,890
I'm trying to figure out...
Darn it, Greg.

451
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:08,809
If you're not even gonna try,
I'm just gonna stop.

452
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:11,145
Mandy, I...

453
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,246
Good night, Greg.

454
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:30,998
Good night, Mandy.

455
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,285
Stop, stop, stop.

456
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:53,622
Trying to steal your boyfriend?
Her boyfriend.

457
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,916
And not your boyfriend?
Not my boyfriend.

458
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:59,336
Speaking of boyfriends,
Mandy, how was your date with Greg?

459
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:01,505
- Good night.
- Good night.

460
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,086
That's it.

461
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:57,931
She broke our date.

462
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,016
Washing her hair.

463
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,559
Dead mother.

464
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:02,769
We're in trouble.

465
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,734
I just checked with the
guys at the Jewish house

466
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:07,399
and they said that every one of our
answers on the psych test were wrong.

467
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,942
Every one?

468
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:14,948
Those assholes must have stolen
the wrong fucking exam.

469
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:22,164
Oh, God, look
what just creeped in.

470
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,166
Well, well, well.

471
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:31,632
Looks like somebody forgot there's
a rule against alcoholic beverages

472
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:33,759
in fraternities on probation.

473
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:35,052
What a tool.

474
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:36,887
I didn't get that, son.
What was that?

475
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,139
I said what a shame

476
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:44,019
that a few bad apples have to spoil
a good time for everyone

477
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,813
by breaking the rules.
Put a sock in it, boy

478
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,816
or else you'll be out of here
like shit through a goose.

479
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,151
Yes, sir.

480
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:54,947
Now, have you boys seen
your grade point average, yet?

481
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:58,242
Well, have you?

482
00:42:58,326 --> 00:42:59,534
I have, sir.

483
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:00,980
I know it's a little
below par...

484
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:04,373
It's more than a little
below par, Mr. Hoover.

485
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:05,791
It stinks!

486
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:10,545
It's the lowest on campus.
It's the lowest in Faber history!

487
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:11,755
Well, sir,

488
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:15,384
we're hoping that our midterm
grades will really help our average.

489
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,345
Laugh now,

490
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:22,099
because you clowns have been
on double secret probation

491
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:24,810
since the beginning
of this semester.

492
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:27,437
Double secret probation?

493
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:30,065
And that means,
one more slip-up,

494
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,858
one more mistake,

495
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:35,696
and this fraternity
of yours has had it

496
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,572
at Faber.

497
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:45,622
Well, that was pleasant. Nice of
him to stop by, don't you think?

498
00:43:45,707 --> 00:43:48,709
We've gotta do something.
He's serious this time.

499
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,419
I think he knows
about the exams.

500
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,921
He's right. You're right.
We gotta do something.

501
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:54,923
Absolutely.
You know what we gotta do?

502
00:43:55,008 --> 00:43:56,758
Toga party.
Toga party.

503
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:59,094
We're on double secret
probation, whatever that is.

504
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,138
We can't afford
to have a toga party.

505
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:02,556
You guys up for a toga party?

506
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,808
Toga! Toga!

507
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,768
I think they like
the idea, Hoov.

508
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:08,478
Oh, Otter,
please don't do this.

509
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:12,733
I got news for you, pal. They're gonna
nail us no matter what we do.

510
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:16,320
So we might as well
have a good time.

511
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:24,904
Toga! Toga! Toga! Toga!

512
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:33,795
It's not gonna be an orgy.

513
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,881
It's a toga party.

514
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:39,134
Honestly, Boon,
you're 21 years old.

515
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,844
In six months,
you're gonna graduate,

516
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,846
and tomorrow night you're gonna
wrap yourself up in a bed sheet

517
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,766
and pour grain alcohol
all over your head.

518
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:48,810
It's cute, but I think
I'll pass this time.

519
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:50,687
Want me to go alone?

520
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:53,190
Baby, I don't want
you to go at all.

521
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:59,321
It's a fraternity party. I'm in
the fraternity. How can I miss it?

522
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:03,533
I'll write you a note.
I'll say you're too well to attend.

523
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:07,746
That's funny. Very funny.

524
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,089
Where'd he get the wheels?

525
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:18,382
From his brother.
Yeah?

526
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:20,634
He's letting him
use it for a week or so.

527
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,220
Flounder's bringing his
girlfriend up for the weekend.

528
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:26,139
Flounder, I am appointing you

529
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:28,975
pledge representative
to the social committee.

530
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:33,146
Gee, Otter. Thanks.
What do I have to do?

531
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:34,981
It means you have to drive
us to the Food King!

532
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,817
Let's go. Let's go!

533
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:40,195
Food King, Food King,
Food King.

534
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,155
Let's go. Food King,
Food King, Food King!

535
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:51,998
Otter, please.

536
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:03,385
What are you doing?

537
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,262
I'm fixing your sweater.

538
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:06,805
There you go.

539
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:18,650
Now, look. Stick by me,
and keep your sweater closed.

540
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:20,902
Hey, I could get in trouble.

541
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:24,364
That's right.
So, be cool.

542
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,376
Mine's bigger than that.

543
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:38,628
I beg your pardon?

544
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:40,714
Oh, my cucumber.
It's bigger.

545
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:48,138
Vegetables can be
really sensuous, don't you think?

546
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:49,973
No.

547
00:46:50,892 --> 00:46:52,809
Vegetables are sensual.

548
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:55,520
People are sensuous.

549
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,732
Right. Sensual.
That's what I meant.

550
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:01,193
By the way, my name
is Eric Stratton.

551
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:03,153
They call me Otter.

552
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:06,573
My name's Marion.
They call me Mrs. Wormer.

553
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,576
We have a Dean Wormer at Faber.

554
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:12,245
What a coincidence.

555
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:15,499
I have a husband named
Dean Wormer at Faber.

556
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:20,879
You still want to
show me your cucumber?

557
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,638
Nothing for me today, thanks.

558
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:34,434
It looks like you gained
some weight since you came in.

559
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:37,062
It's just a prank.
I'm pledging a fraternity.

560
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:39,773
Don't sweat it, sweetie.
I won't tell.

561
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:45,320
Well, we're having a little party
at the Delta Tau Chi house tonight

562
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,656
and you are cordially invited.

563
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:52,619
I'm old enough to be
your mother. Almost.

564
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:57,874
Besides, I have to go to the
goddamn senior honors dinner tonight.

565
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:01,336
Well, maybe some other time.

566
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:05,048
Doubtful.

567
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:07,008
Maybe?

568
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:10,720
So if you're not busy, you
wanna go to a fraternity party?

569
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,389
Will I be home by 12:00?

570
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:15,892
Sure. Any time you want.
I'll pick you up at...

571
00:48:15,977 --> 00:48:19,396
My dad would kill me if he knew
I was going to a frat house.

572
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,814
Is it okay if I meet you there?

573
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,399
Is it okay?

574
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:23,984
It's terrific!

575
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,329
Well, girls, welcome to the
Delta toga party. Come in.

576
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:38,999
Here, let me take your coat.

577
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,168
Great pair of togas.

578
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:44,921
Hey, why don't you help yourself
to some delicious Delta punch

579
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:46,965
and I'll join you in a minute.

580
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,758
Otter, this is Sissy,
my steady girl, Sissy.

581
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:32,802
- Sis, this is the guy I was telling you about.
- Hi.

582
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:35,639
Wow. You're even prettier
than Kent said you were.

583
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:38,141
What a great dress.
Yeah.

584
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:41,061
Listen, you two talk while
I get some punch for us, okay?

585
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:42,729
Good idea.
All right.

586
00:49:43,773 --> 00:49:48,193
Kent's really a lucky guy.
Why don't we go sit down somewhere?

587
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:59,496
I gave my love a cherry

588
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:04,209
That had no stone

589
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:09,005
I gave my love a chicken

590
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:13,259
That had no bones

591
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:18,306
I gave my love a story

592
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:22,644
That had no end

593
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,396
I gave

594
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:34,864
Sorry.

595
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,329
Hi.
Hi.

596
00:50:41,414 --> 00:50:43,540
You look great.
So do you.

597
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:50,755
I had to wait
until my folks went out.

598
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,133
Get me some more punch.

599
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:58,304
Thanks. Got a lot
of catching up to do.

600
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:06,604
You wanna dance?

601
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:08,523
Huh?
Do you wanna dance?

602
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:09,649
Yeah!

603
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:15,048
Hey, Otis!

604
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:50,917
Yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah!

605
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:47,348
Gator!

606
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,538
Mrs. Wormer, I'm so
glad you could come.

607
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:54,082
Cut the crap.

608
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:56,209
Give me a drink.

609
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:03,383
This is Hoover's room.

610
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:04,968
Oh, yeah? It's neat.

611
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:47,046
I think it's locked
or something.

612
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:51,050
Just a minute.

613
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:23,916
Fuck her.
Fuck her brains out.

614
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:28,796
Suck her tits. Squeeze her buns.
You know she wants it.

615
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:36,470
For shame! Lawrence,
I'm surprised at you!

616
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:40,391
Don't listen to that jack-off.
Look at those gazongas.

617
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,019
You'll never
get a better chance.

618
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:46,856
If you lay one finger
on that poor, sweet, helpless girl,

619
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,275
you'll despise yourself forever!

620
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:55,573
I'm proud of you, Lawrence.

621
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:57,533
You homo.

622
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:38,866
My fault?

623
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:42,578
For Christ's sake, Carmine,
how the hell could it be my fault?

624
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,831
One of those goddamn
fraternities, I guess.

625
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:49,335
I don't know, but I got a pretty good
goddamn idea which one!

626
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:54,173
I'm gonna string them up by the balls!
That's what I'm gonna do!

627
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:18,948
I just bet it was
that Eric Stratton.

628
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,574
You know that for sure?

629
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:24,829
Well, no, but, you'd be surprised
at some of the girls he's had.

630
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:27,873
Very surprised.

631
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:39,677
Must've been some party.

632
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:40,970
Unbelievable!

633
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:43,472
A new low.
I'm so ashamed.

634
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:45,141
Gee, I'm almost
sorry I missed it.

635
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:47,476
What'd you do?
Human sacrifice?

636
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:52,231
No, just some harmless fun.
Buy me a dinner tonight?

637
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:55,318
Can't tonight. Busy.

638
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:58,321
Busy tonight?

639
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:23,387
Please take your seats.

640
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:29,018
This meeting of the disciplinary
council will now come to order.

641
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:33,689
We'll waive minutes and proceed directly
with charges against Delta Tau Chi.

642
01:01:34,483 --> 01:01:35,900
Sergeant at Arms?

643
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:46,869
The following charges
are brought:

644
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:51,624
First, that the Delta House
did knowingly violate the rules

645
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,001
on governing pledge recruitment

646
01:01:54,086 --> 01:01:57,755
by serving alcohol to
freshmen during pledge week

647
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:00,508
and after established
drinking hours.

648
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:04,011
I'd like to address these
charges one at a time, if I may.

649
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:06,430
You'll get your chance,
smart guy.

650
01:02:06,807 --> 01:02:08,599
Now, get on with it.

651
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:12,603
Second, that for the fifth
consecutive semester,

652
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:16,399
Delta has achieved a deficient
aggregate grade point average.

653
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:19,193
Half the houses on campus
didn't make grades last year.

654
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:23,364
You will speak when you're
told to speak and not before! Read.

655
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:28,369
Third, that the Delta
fraternity routinely provided

656
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:33,207
dangerous narcotic diet pills
to its members during...

657
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,583
That's not true!

658
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:36,001
Not another word!

659
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:38,671
During midterm examination week.

660
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:44,677
And, most recently

661
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:48,139
that a Roman toga party was held

662
01:02:49,141 --> 01:02:50,724
from which we have received

663
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:54,854
two dozen reports
of individual acts of perversion,

664
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:58,190
so profound and disgusting

665
01:02:59,151 --> 01:03:02,111
that decorum prohibits
listing them here.

666
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:09,201
These are the charges as recorded
this day 15 November, 1962.

667
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:13,164
Faithfully submitted,
Douglas C. Neidermeyer,

668
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,541
Sergeant at Arms.

669
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:19,420
Well done.

670
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:22,631
Robert Hoover will speak
on behalf of Delta House.

671
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,479
I don't think you can
fully judge a fraternity

672
01:03:36,563 --> 01:03:39,982
without looking at the positive
qualities of the people in it.

673
01:03:40,192 --> 01:03:43,944
The Delta House has a long tradition
of existence to its members

674
01:03:44,029 --> 01:03:46,280
and to the community at large.

675
01:03:46,907 --> 01:03:49,158
I think we've heard
enough, Mr. Chairman.

676
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:50,563
I was told I'd
have a chance to...

677
01:03:50,619 --> 01:03:51,994
That's enough!

678
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:53,829
The court will now
render a decision.

679
01:03:53,914 --> 01:03:55,164
But, look, you said
I could speak...

680
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:56,332
He said, "That's it!"

681
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:57,958
Are you deaf?

682
01:03:58,043 --> 01:04:00,085
Let's finish this damn thing.

683
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:01,754
Blow job!

684
01:04:03,215 --> 01:04:06,133
Blow job.

685
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,177
I don't think it's fair!

686
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:10,804
I'll tell you what's fair
and what's not!

687
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:14,266
Eat me! Eat me! Eat me!

688
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:18,896
Will you tell those
assholes to shut up?

689
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:21,065
Hey, shut up, you assholes!

690
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:24,443
Mr. President, do we have to
listen to any more of this?

691
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:26,153
Point of parliamentary
procedure.

692
01:04:26,238 --> 01:04:28,531
Don't screw around.
They're serious this time.

693
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:29,990
Take it easy.
I'm in Pre-Law, man.

694
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:32,243
I thought you're Pre-Med?
What's the difference?

695
01:04:32,327 --> 01:04:34,870
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'll be brief.

696
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:37,998
What the hell do
you think he's up to?

697
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:41,835
The issue here is not whether
we broke a few rules or

698
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:45,172
took a few liberties
with our female party guests.

699
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:46,799
We did.

700
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:50,970
But you can't hold a
whole fraternity responsible

701
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:55,140
for the behavior of a few
sick, perverted individuals.

702
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:58,269
For if you do,

703
01:04:58,353 --> 01:05:01,355
then shouldn't we blame
the whole fraternity system?

704
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:05,484
And if the whole fraternity
system is guilty,

705
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:08,195
then isn't this an indictment

706
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,948
of our educational
institutions in general?

707
01:05:13,702 --> 01:05:15,578
I put it to you, Greg!

708
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:20,666
Isn't this an indictment
of our entire American society?

709
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:26,714
Well, you can do
what you want to us,

710
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:30,259
but we are not going to
sit here and listen to you

711
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:33,429
badmouth the United States of America!

712
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:35,139
Gentlemen!

713
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,226
Order!

714
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:45,024
You're not walking out on this
one, mister. You're finished.

715
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:47,318
No more Delta!

716
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:50,863
You bought it
this time, buster!

717
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:53,949
I am calling
your national office!

718
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,620
I am going to revoke
your charter!

719
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:04,501
And if you wise guys
try one more thing, one more,

720
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:06,795
I'm going to kick you out
of this college!

721
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,881
No more fun of any kind!

722
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,865
When my father was in Korea,
see, he wasn't a flyer.

723
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:38,577
He was in the infantry,
and he was an officer, of course.

724
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:43,457
How does it feel to be
an independent, Schoenstein?

725
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,585
How does it feel to be
an asshole, Neidermeyer?

726
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:48,587
What did he say?

727
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:52,007
Hoover says they won't even let us
nter a float in the homecoming parade.

728
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:55,386
Some stupid zombies get to ride
a pile of Kleenex down the street?

729
01:06:56,805 --> 01:06:57,971
Hey, look!

730
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,769
Goddamn son of a bitch!

731
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:07,439
I'll kill you, you scumbag,
jerk-off assholes!

732
01:07:08,692 --> 01:07:10,901
Jesus. What's going on?

733
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:13,987
They confiscated everything,
even the stuff we didn't steal.

734
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:19,535
They took the bar!
The whole fucking bar!

735
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:47,104
Thanks. I needed that.

736
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:50,399
Christ.

737
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:54,153
Otter, this is ridiculous.

738
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:56,405
What are we gonna do?

739
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:58,490
Road trip.
Road trip.

740
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:01,910
But you can't take the car, Otter!
Fred wrote the mileage down!

741
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:04,788
He wants it back by Sunday.
Please don't take the car!

742
01:08:04,873 --> 01:08:06,999
It's very important!
He'll get very mad at me!

743
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,126
Get in.
You can't... No!

744
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:13,422
But, Otter,
don't you understand?

745
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:15,174
He wants it back!
Where'd you go?

746
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:17,217
He wants it back by Sunday!

747
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:23,932
Fred's gonna kill me!
This car is expensive!

748
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:32,483
Please,
I'm gonna get in trouble!

749
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:34,777
We can have fun,
but drive carefully.

750
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:37,112
We won't tell anybody
that it happened.

751
01:08:37,197 --> 01:08:39,072
I hear
Dickinson girls are fast.

752
01:08:39,157 --> 01:08:41,617
What should I say?
I mean, how should I handle it?

753
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:45,454
Just mention modern art, civil rights
or folk music, and you're in like Flynn.

754
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:47,790
You sure we have dates?
Absolutely.

755
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:49,792
Boon, what's this
chick's name again?

756
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:54,129
"Fawn Liebowitz."

757
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:56,965
Fawn Liebowitz and she was from
Fort Wayne, Indiana.

758
01:08:57,050 --> 01:09:00,135
I hope I score.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy!

759
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:11,230
Turn the car around.
I'll be right back.

760
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:30,749
Excuse me?
Can I help you?

761
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:32,501
Well, I'm here
to pick up my date.

762
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:34,628
Could you ring
Fawn Liebowitz for me?

763
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:36,922
Fawn Liebowitz?

764
01:09:38,258 --> 01:09:39,758
Just a minute.

765
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:46,640
Hello, Shelly? This is Brunella at the desk.
Could you come down here?

766
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:48,100
Now.

767
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:51,770
Because a boy just came in
to pick up Fawn, that's why.

768
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:53,021
Thank you.

769
01:09:54,274 --> 01:09:55,357
Is she coming down?

770
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:58,318
Her roommate is. Fawn isn't here.
She...

771
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:02,906
Would you excuse me a minute?

772
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:11,540
Evening.

773
01:10:23,678 --> 01:10:26,179
Hi, I'm Shelly Dubinsky,
Fawn's roommate.

774
01:10:26,264 --> 01:10:29,349
Hi, I'm Frank Lymon from
Amherst, Fawn's fiancé.

775
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:30,893
Her...

776
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:33,604
Actually, we're engaged
to be engaged.

777
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:36,940
What's the matter with
everyone around here?

778
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,443
Why don't we sit down, Frank?

779
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:40,944
Sure.

780
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:50,245
I don't know how to tell you.
So, I'm just gonna tell you.

781
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:52,456
Fawn's dead.

782
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:55,250
She's dead?

783
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:03,592
Did she put you up to this? Oh, that minx.
What a lively sense of humor.

784
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:09,348
"Sophomore dies
in kiln explosion."

785
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,810
Oh, my God.

786
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:16,271
I'm terribly,
terribly sorry, Frank.

787
01:11:17,649 --> 01:11:19,942
I just talked to her last week.

788
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:23,695
She was gonna
make a pot for me.

789
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:26,573
If there's anything I can do...

790
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,828
You're so nice.

791
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:34,581
I really shouldn't
impose on you.

792
01:11:34,666 --> 01:11:36,917
No, really. Anything.

793
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,922
I just don't think I should
be alone tonight.

794
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:43,715
Would...

795
01:11:45,093 --> 01:11:47,094
Would you go out with me?

796
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:50,514
I'll get my coat.

797
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:56,269
And, could you get
three dates for my friends?

798
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:08,907
Otter, holy shit!

799
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:10,833
Otis Day and the Knights!
I don't believe this!

800
01:12:13,413 --> 01:12:16,540
It feels so good to be back here
at the Dexter Lake Club.

801
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:21,837
We'd like to do for you now a tune entitled
Shamalamma Ding Dong. So, hit it.

802
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:36,935
Wait till Otis sees us!
He loves us!

803
01:12:39,939 --> 01:12:44,735
Oh, my God!
It's dented. It's dented!

804
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:49,656
It's dented.

805
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:01,209
We are gonna die.

806
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:04,796
Boon, we're the only
white people here.

807
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:34,826
You sure it's...
Don't worry about a thing, man.

808
01:13:42,085 --> 01:13:46,338
A double rock 'n' rye
and seven Carlings.

809
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:52,677
Otis! My man!

810
01:14:09,237 --> 01:14:11,238
You girls come here often?

811
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:16,868
Frank, are you all right?

812
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:20,122
Yeah. This is really fun.

813
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,696
I'm really sorry, Frank.

814
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:57,117
I know what you
must be going through.

815
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:04,583
Would you rather be alone?

816
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:22,601
- So, what are you majoring in?
- What?

817
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:26,938
- What are you majoring in?
- Primitive cultures.

818
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:34,446
I need you so much.

819
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:40,785
I'm here, Frank, I'm here.

820
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:47,125
Move to your left a little.

821
01:15:47,835 --> 01:15:48,960
Good.

822
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:01,973
Where do you go to school?

823
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:05,518
I wonder where Otter is.

824
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:07,896
Maybe I should go
outside and look for him.

825
01:16:12,944 --> 01:16:15,153
I used to touch Fawn this way.

826
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:20,116
I know. She told me.

827
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:22,994
She did?

828
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:52,941
Do you mind if we dance
with your dates?

829
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:57,737
Why, no, not at all.
Go right ahead.

830
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:13,295
If I was in your shoes,
I'd be...

831
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:15,797
Leaving.
What a good idea.

832
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:23,805
Wait a minute! Hold it.

833
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:26,725
Compose yourself, Otter.
We got to get out of here!

834
01:17:28,019 --> 01:17:30,103
The Negroes took our dates!

835
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:33,732
Oh, my God, Boon!
Please be careful!

836
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:38,069
Be careful! That's gonna cost
hundreds of dollars to fix!

837
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:43,408
Oh, my God!

838
01:17:44,744 --> 01:17:46,077
We're out!

839
01:17:53,294 --> 01:17:57,297
What baffles me is why Fawn would
have gone out with boys like that.

840
01:17:57,423 --> 01:18:00,425
They reminded me of criminals.
They were horrible.

841
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:03,386
Well, I don't know,
I think Frank was kind of cute.

842
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:07,223
Well, I really
felt sorry for him.

843
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:10,101
He started crying and...

844
01:18:30,373 --> 01:18:31,873
What'd Katy say?

845
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:33,166
She wasn't home.

846
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:35,543
Where could she
be at 6:00 a.m.?

847
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:37,212
What is with you two?

848
01:18:37,296 --> 01:18:39,631
I don't know.
Something's wrong.

849
01:18:40,174 --> 01:18:43,718
Women. Can't live with them,
can't live without them.

850
01:18:49,475 --> 01:18:51,434
Hey, you know where Mandy is?

851
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:54,062
She was supposed to come
over to help make teeth.

852
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:58,149
Sure don't, Greg. She said she was
just gonna wash her hair.

853
01:18:58,901 --> 01:19:02,237
That's typical, just when we're
doing something important.

854
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:08,618
Greg, I hate to see her
make such a chump out of you.

855
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:11,996
What are you saying?

856
01:19:13,833 --> 01:19:17,961
I'm saying that Mandy and
Eric Stratton are having an affair.

857
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:22,715
But, I love you, Greg.
That's why I had to tell you.

858
01:19:31,725 --> 01:19:35,854
Babs, I want you to
do something for me.

859
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:42,777
Good.

860
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,951
I'm out of here.
Katy?

861
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:51,703
Yeah?
Good luck.

862
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:39,918
Stop blubbering.

863
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:43,129
When I get through with this thing,
you won't even recognize it.

864
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:46,049
Come on. Flounder.

865
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:49,010
You can't spend your whole life
worrying about your mistakes.

866
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:51,763
You fucked up.
You trusted us.

867
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:55,475
Hey, make the best of it.
Maybe we can help you.

868
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:59,395
That's easy for you to say!
What am I gonna tell Fred?

869
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:03,149
I'll tell you what.

870
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:07,278
I'll swear you were doing
a great job taking care of his car,

871
01:21:07,363 --> 01:21:12,283
but you parked it out back last
night and this morning, it was gone.

872
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:16,412
D-Day takes care of the wreck!
We report it to the police.

873
01:21:16,497 --> 01:21:19,791
Your brother's insurance company
buys him a new car.

874
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:24,170
Will that work?

875
01:21:24,255 --> 01:21:26,589
It's got to work
better than the truth.

876
01:21:28,592 --> 01:21:32,345
My advice to you is
to start drinking heavily.

877
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:36,808
You'd better listen to him,
Flounder. He's in Pre-Med.

878
01:21:39,645 --> 01:21:42,605
There you go now,
just leave everything to me.

879
01:21:55,202 --> 01:21:56,494
Hi, Katy.

880
01:22:01,584 --> 01:22:03,001
I missed you.

881
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:06,838
- Boon, I was gonna try and call you...
- Where are they, Katy?

882
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:14,137
Boon, I don't know what to say.

883
01:22:16,599 --> 01:22:17,974
Boon, wait!

884
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:22,353
Shit.
Must be in the kitchen.

885
01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:27,650
What's the matter?

886
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:36,451
Yeah, there they are.

887
01:22:38,037 --> 01:22:41,039
Are you sure, Babs?
Why would Mandy want to see me?

888
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:44,959
Well, I'm sure I don't know,
Otter. You'll just have to ask her,

889
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:48,087
as soon as you can get there.

890
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:54,135
Well, do you know the
Rainbow Motel on Old Mill Road?

891
01:22:56,055 --> 01:22:58,056
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

892
01:22:58,599 --> 01:22:59,682
Bye.

893
01:23:04,897 --> 01:23:06,064
Teddy!

894
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:09,609
Did you get the grade reports
on the Deltas yet?

895
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:13,237
Yes, I have it right here.

896
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:16,407
Why didn't you tell me?

897
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:24,540
Good.

898
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:28,795
Good, good, good.

899
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:53,611
It's Mr. Thoughtful
with a dozen roses for you.

900
01:23:55,906 --> 01:23:58,074
One, two, three, four, five.

901
01:23:58,617 --> 01:24:01,202
Well, looks like we're gonna be
a couple of flowers short,

902
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:03,329
so some of you boys
are gonna have to...

903
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:11,212
Where are the other two?
Stratton and Schoenstein?

904
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,548
We looked everywhere,
sir, but...

905
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:15,591
Never mind, it doesn't matter.

906
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:19,137
You gentlemen seen
your midterm grades yet?

907
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:21,097
Well, they're not
posted yet, sir.

908
01:24:21,515 --> 01:24:22,974
I've seen them.

909
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:28,479
Mr. Kroger, two C's,
two D's, and an F.

910
01:24:29,022 --> 01:24:31,023
That's a 1.2 grade average.

911
01:24:31,108 --> 01:24:34,819
Congratulations, Kroger, you're at
the top of the Delta pledge class.

912
01:24:37,531 --> 01:24:38,865
Mr. Dorfman.

913
01:24:39,158 --> 01:24:40,324
Hello.

914
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:42,285
0.2.

915
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:47,957
Fat, drunk, and stupid is
no way to go through life, son.

916
01:24:49,668 --> 01:24:54,589
Mr. Hoover,
president of Delta House, 1.6.

917
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:58,384
Four C's and an F,
a fine example you set.

918
01:24:58,802 --> 01:25:03,723
Daniel Simpson Day
has no grade point average.

919
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:05,725
All courses incomplete.

920
01:25:06,685 --> 01:25:08,019
Mister...

921
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:12,982
Mr. Blutarsky.

922
01:25:14,985 --> 01:25:18,321
0.0.

923
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:24,285
Now, I want you to tell Mr. Stratton
and Mr. Schoenstein

924
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:26,287
exactly what I'm about
to tell you now.

925
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:27,455
What's that, sir?

926
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:30,249
You're out. Finished
at Faber. Expelled.

927
01:25:30,334 --> 01:25:33,586
I want you off this campus at
9:00 Monday morning!

928
01:25:35,798 --> 01:25:38,216
And I'm sure
you'll be happy to know

929
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:42,804
that I have notified
your local draft boards

930
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:44,847
and told them that
you are now all...

931
01:25:46,308 --> 01:25:49,894
All eligible
for military service.

932
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:55,400
Well?

933
01:26:03,116 --> 01:26:04,408
Out with it.

934
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:19,757
Relax, Greg, honey.

935
01:26:20,217 --> 01:26:24,971
You know, I know, everybody knows
that Otter certainly had it coming.

936
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:30,017
I don't think the Deltas
will be giving us any more trouble.

937
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:31,102
No.

938
01:26:32,396 --> 01:26:36,274
Greg, honey, is it
supposed to be this soft?

939
01:26:40,487 --> 01:26:41,737
Christ!

940
01:26:42,948 --> 01:26:45,533
Seven years of college
down the drain.

941
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:49,120
Might as well join
the fucking Peace Corps.

942
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:51,247
My mother's gonna kill me.

943
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:56,711
I knew it. I knew it,
I knew it, I knew it.

944
01:26:58,297 --> 01:27:02,049
I can't believe I threw up
in front of Dean Wormer.

945
01:27:02,551 --> 01:27:06,345
Face it, Kent.
You threw up on Dean Wormer.

946
01:27:24,573 --> 01:27:28,242
Jesus Christ. What happened?
You look grotesque.

947
01:27:28,911 --> 01:27:31,829
Some of the Omegas
did a little dance on my face.

948
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,456
Who was it?

949
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:40,713
It was Greggie and Dougie
and some of the other Hitler youth.

950
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:42,673
Why, what'd you do?

951
01:27:43,133 --> 01:27:46,052
I don't know. They're
just animals, I guess.

952
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:52,350
Looks like I missed something.

953
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:54,185
Yeah, you did.

954
01:27:54,353 --> 01:27:56,646
We're all officially
kicked out of school.

955
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:58,356
Wormer just got our grades.

956
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:04,070
They kicked us out of school?
That makes sense.

957
01:28:04,154 --> 01:28:07,782
Hey! What's this
lying around shit?

958
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,785
What the hell are we
supposed to do, you moron?

959
01:28:10,869 --> 01:28:13,287
War's over, man.
Wormer dropped the big one.

960
01:28:13,372 --> 01:28:16,999
What? Over?
Did you say, "over"?

961
01:28:18,043 --> 01:28:20,419
Nothing is over
until we decide it is!

962
01:28:20,963 --> 01:28:23,756
Was it over when the Germans
bombed Pearl Harbor?

963
01:28:24,216 --> 01:28:26,676
- Hell, no!
- Germans?

964
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:27,802
Forget it, he's rolling.

965
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:29,720
And it ain't over now

966
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:33,057
because when
the going gets tough,

967
01:28:39,398 --> 01:28:41,023
the tough get going!

968
01:28:41,108 --> 01:28:44,318
Who's with me?
Let's go! Come on!

969
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:01,585
What the fuck happened to
the Delta I used to know?

970
01:29:02,295 --> 01:29:04,046
Where's the spirit?

971
01:29:05,799 --> 01:29:07,675
Where's the guts, huh?

972
01:29:10,929 --> 01:29:14,056
This could be the greatest
night of our lives,

973
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:16,976
but you're gonna
let it be the worst.

974
01:29:17,894 --> 01:29:21,772
"We're afraid to go with you, Bluto.
We might get in trouble."

975
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:24,525
Well, just kiss
my ass from now on!

976
01:29:24,943 --> 01:29:27,570
Not me!
I'm not gonna take this!

977
01:29:27,904 --> 01:29:31,991
Wormer, he's a dead man!
Marmalard, dead!

978
01:29:32,409 --> 01:29:34,869
- Neidermeyer?
- Dead.

979
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:37,079
Bluto's right.

980
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:40,958
Psychotic,
but absolutely right.

981
01:29:42,544 --> 01:29:44,795
We got to take these bastards.

982
01:29:46,465 --> 01:29:50,468
Now, we could fight them
with conventional weapons,

983
01:29:51,136 --> 01:29:55,097
but that could take years
and cost millions of lives.

984
01:29:55,932 --> 01:29:57,308
No, no, no.

985
01:29:58,435 --> 01:30:03,355
No. In this case,
I think we have to go all out.

986
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:08,277
I think this situation
absolutely requires

987
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:13,115
a really futile
and stupid gesture

988
01:30:13,492 --> 01:30:15,618
be done on somebody's part.

989
01:30:15,994 --> 01:30:18,204
We're just the guys to do it.

990
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:27,588
Let's do it.
Let's do it!

991
01:30:29,633 --> 01:30:33,010
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

992
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:25,146
Tommy?
Tommy?

993
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:28,774
Hi.
Hi.

994
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:33,112
I'm Larry. Remember me,
I took you to the party?

995
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:35,239
Wait a minute.

996
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:47,501
So, how come you show up now?
I didn't expect to see you.

997
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:50,921
Well, I never got a chance to say
good night to you after the party.

998
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:53,591
No kidding.
They almost pumped my stomach.

999
01:31:53,675 --> 01:31:56,552
Look, is it okay if we go
for a walk or something?

1000
01:31:56,928 --> 01:31:58,762
What do you mean,
"or something?"

1001
01:31:58,847 --> 01:32:00,306
Well, I could get some beer.

1002
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:04,768
No, not tonight, okay?
Besides, you might get lucky without it.

1003
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:15,529
Before we go any further,
there's something I have to tell you.

1004
01:32:15,614 --> 01:32:18,490
I lied to you,
I've never done this before.

1005
01:32:18,742 --> 01:32:20,701
You've never made out
with a girl before?

1006
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:22,411
No. No, I mean,

1007
01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:24,371
I've never done what I think
we're gonna do in a minute.

1008
01:32:24,456 --> 01:32:25,777
I sort of did once,
but I was...

1009
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:27,833
That's okay, Larry,
neither have I.

1010
01:32:30,629 --> 01:32:33,714
And besides,
I lied to you, too.

1011
01:32:33,798 --> 01:32:35,382
Oh, yeah? What about?

1012
01:32:35,467 --> 01:32:36,926
I'm only 13.

1013
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:45,309
Hi, there.

1014
01:32:47,312 --> 01:32:49,313
Yes, well,
marvelous day. Yes.

1015
01:32:49,481 --> 01:32:52,816
Excuse me. Excuse me, please.
Pardon me. Excuse me, please.

1016
01:32:52,901 --> 01:32:56,111
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Okay, kid, off that mailbox.

1017
01:32:56,196 --> 01:32:59,156
That's government property.
Come on, let's go. Move, move it.

1018
01:33:01,243 --> 01:33:03,953
Excuse me, please.
Would you hold this?

1019
01:33:07,624 --> 01:33:09,083
Thank you very much.

1020
01:33:11,044 --> 01:33:12,378
Excuse me.

1021
01:33:12,921 --> 01:33:15,965
My kid can't see. Is it all right
if he stands in front of you?

1022
01:33:16,049 --> 01:33:17,091
No.

1023
01:33:23,139 --> 01:33:24,348
Hoover.

1024
01:33:25,183 --> 01:33:27,893
Hoover! Hoover!

1025
01:33:27,978 --> 01:33:28,978
Ow!

1026
01:33:29,646 --> 01:33:31,438
Hoover, where's Boon?

1027
01:33:31,648 --> 01:33:34,733
Katy, I don't think
you should stay around here.

1028
01:33:35,151 --> 01:33:36,902
What're you talking about?

1029
01:33:39,114 --> 01:33:41,115
We all got expelled last night.

1030
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:44,535
What? Why?

1031
01:33:45,537 --> 01:33:47,997
Where's Boon?
Katy, listen to me.

1032
01:33:48,081 --> 01:33:51,375
I think you'd be glad later
if you weren't here now.

1033
01:34:04,848 --> 01:34:07,266
May I have 10,000
marbles, please?

1034
01:34:10,729 --> 01:34:11,937
Testing.

1035
01:34:13,398 --> 01:34:15,566
It gives me great pleasure

1036
01:34:15,942 --> 01:34:20,571
to present this ceremonial
gold-plated whistle

1037
01:34:21,573 --> 01:34:24,992
to this year's
Honorary Grand Marshal

1038
01:34:25,076 --> 01:34:27,703
Dean Vernon Wormer.

1039
01:34:34,085 --> 01:34:38,964
Mr. Marshal, the streets
of Faber are yours.

1040
01:34:39,174 --> 01:34:40,674
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1041
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:17,961
Let's go.

1042
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:54,998
Sequence! Hut!

1043
01:35:56,126 --> 01:35:57,292
Faber!

1044
01:35:59,129 --> 01:36:02,339
Faber! Faber!

1045
01:37:48,905 --> 01:37:50,364
Thank you, God!

1046
01:37:54,786 --> 01:37:57,120
Say, those guys
are coming pretty fast.

1047
01:38:15,974 --> 01:38:18,767
What the fuck's going on down there?
I don't know.

1048
01:38:20,478 --> 01:38:24,189
Let's stop this now. Charge!

1049
01:38:36,828 --> 01:38:39,413
Get up, you faggots!
Get up and charge!

1050
01:38:39,497 --> 01:38:42,082
Stand up and fight
for Christ's sake!

1051
01:38:50,216 --> 01:38:52,217
Faggots! Faggots!

1052
01:39:05,356 --> 01:39:08,859
Remain calm. All is well.

1053
01:39:29,464 --> 01:39:30,922
Cut the cake.

1054
01:39:38,765 --> 01:39:39,890
Look!

1055
01:39:57,492 --> 01:39:59,409
Oh, my God.

1056
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:28,105
Let's take the cheese.

1057
01:40:32,568 --> 01:40:34,903
I hate those guys.

1058
01:40:42,578 --> 01:40:45,455
Ramming speed!

1059
01:40:57,969 --> 01:41:01,012
Oh, boy, is this great!

1060
01:41:04,767 --> 01:41:07,144
All is well!

1061
01:41:07,562 --> 01:41:11,273
You can take your thumb out
of my ass any time now, Carmine.

1062
01:41:11,357 --> 01:41:12,691
Remain...

1063
01:41:22,994 --> 01:41:25,871
This may seem an inopportune
moment to ask, Dean Wormer,

1064
01:41:25,955 --> 01:41:30,041
but do you think you could see your way
clear to giving us just one more chance?

1065
01:41:39,761 --> 01:41:42,095
Daddy! Mom, Dad,

1066
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:45,766
this is Larry Kroger,
the boy who molested me last month.

1067
01:41:46,309 --> 01:41:47,517
We have to get married.

1068
01:41:47,602 --> 01:41:49,352
We should discuss this
some other time, sir.

1069
01:41:49,437 --> 01:41:51,021
I know that you're very busy...

1070
01:42:02,825 --> 01:42:04,493
Come out of there!

1071
01:42:08,039 --> 01:42:10,123
Come out of there,
you bastards!

1072
01:42:10,208 --> 01:42:11,833
Who is it?

1073
01:42:11,918 --> 01:42:13,543
You know damn well who it is!

1074
01:42:13,628 --> 01:42:17,756
I'm sorry, you'll have to come back
later, I'm doing the dishes.

1075
01:42:25,264 --> 01:42:27,182
Greg, look at my thumb.

1076
01:42:29,393 --> 01:42:31,019
Gee, you're dumb.

1077
01:42:51,123 --> 01:42:52,207
Bye.

1078
01:42:52,959 --> 01:42:55,293
Excuse me! Pardon me!
Pardon me!

1079
01:43:11,811 --> 01:43:14,104
Hey, Neidermeyer!

1080
01:43:53,561 --> 01:43:56,229
Don't you guys think
you've had enough?

1081
01:43:56,314 --> 01:43:59,649
Okay, okay!
Now, I'm really mad!

1082
01:43:59,734 --> 01:44:02,569
Now, you've had it!
Officers, officers, please!

1083
01:44:02,653 --> 01:44:05,822
For God's sake, please!
They're looting the Food King!

1084
01:44:06,282 --> 01:44:08,533
Come back and fight!

1085
01:44:11,829 --> 01:44:13,830
No prisoners!
