00:10:45,974 --> 00:10:48,545
- Where the frig have you been?
- Bloody Ada!

163
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,756
Took me an hour
to get someone to go in for me.

164
00:10:50,808 --> 00:10:53,840
You had to wait a bloody hour for that pie?
Give me that shit.

165
00:10:53,891 --> 00:10:55,265
For God's sake.

166
00:10:55,308 --> 00:10:57,796
- Who the fuck's he?
- What is your name?

167
00:10:57,849 --> 00:10:59,342
I'm Shaun.

168
00:10:59,391 --> 00:11:01,382
Shaun, I'm Woody, mate.
Nice to meet you.

169
00:11:01,433 --> 00:11:03,174
That there's Milky, my main man.

170
00:11:03,224 --> 00:11:05,381
Pukey's a nutcase. Don't wind him up.

171
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:07,340
That's Kez. He's pretty chilled out.

172
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,970
And this fat idiot's Gadget.

173
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,382
You are, Gadget, you are.

174
00:11:14,432 --> 00:11:16,672
Anyway, Shaun, move.
You're in my seat.

175
00:11:16,724 --> 00:11:17,921
What?

176
00:11:17,974 --> 00:11:19,218
Move.

177
00:11:19,265 --> 00:11:22,263
Gadget, mate, out of all the places to sit,
you want to sit there?

178
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,930
- Yeah, I do.
Shall I move?

179
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,427
What are you asking him for?
Move, now.

180
00:11:26,473 --> 00:11:29,222
- He don't have to bloody move.
- Fucking does. Get out.

181
00:11:29,265 --> 00:11:32,429
Oi, it's a free country.
You sit there if you want to sit there.

182
00:11:32,473 --> 00:11:35,044
- Have you seen these?
- Woody, tell him.

183
00:11:35,098 --> 00:11:36,639
Woody, tell 'em.

184
00:11:36,682 --> 00:11:38,055
Get the fuck...

185
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,556
Calm down.

186
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,554
Will you just calm down?

187
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:44,051
Fucking behave.
You need to learn when to chill out.

188
00:11:44,098 --> 00:11:45,128
What...?

189
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:46,971
Get the fuck out of my seat now!

190
00:11:47,015 --> 00:11:50,131
Out of this tunnel or I'll make
your life a living fucking hell.

191
00:11:50,181 --> 00:11:51,971
- Fuck off!
- Fuck out!

192
00:11:52,015 --> 00:11:55,629
- You're a pain in my arse.
- You're all a bunch of bastards!

193
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,174
Oh, fuck off!

194
00:11:57,223 --> 00:11:59,972
You prick!
Shaun, come back, mate.

195
00:12:00,015 --> 00:12:01,721
- Sit down.
- Oh, bloody hell.

196
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:03,387
Shaun! Sh...

197
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,754
Oh, I feel bad. I feel bad now.

198
00:12:05,806 --> 00:12:09,634
Well done, well done. Are you happy with
your fucking pie now, you prick?

199
00:12:09,681 --> 00:12:12,169
You're a frigging bully, Gadget.

200
00:12:17,806 --> 00:12:19,797
See what you can do with this.

201
00:12:19,848 --> 00:12:22,217
What C is a fodder plant...

202
00:12:25,306 --> 00:12:27,095
- Hiya, love.
- Hello.

203
00:12:28,264 --> 00:12:30,053
- You all right?
- Yeah.

204
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:32,301
Had a good day at school?

205
00:12:37,472 --> 00:12:38,467
Shaun?

206
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,884
What's wrong, love?
Shaun, come here.

207
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:42,925
What?

208
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:44,963
Sit down.
I want to have a word with you.

209
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,211
Why?

210
00:12:46,264 --> 00:12:48,255
Please, son, I want to talk to you.

211
00:12:49,597 --> 00:12:50,876
What?

212
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,135
What have you done to your face?

213
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,423
Nothing.

214
00:12:54,471 --> 00:12:58,168
You've got all scratches all over your face.
Have you been fighting?

215
00:12:58,221 --> 00:13:00,259
No, I did it on the way home from school.

216
00:13:00,305 --> 00:13:03,635
You didn't. You're lying to me.
How have you done it?

217
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:06,886
It was a boy at school.

218
00:13:08,096 --> 00:13:10,383
He made a joke about Dad, so I hit him.

219
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,171
Well, what did he say about Dad?

220
00:13:12,221 --> 00:13:14,342
I don't wanna say it, Mum.
It's disgusting.

221
00:13:14,388 --> 00:13:16,343
Shaun, I want to know what he said.

222
00:13:16,388 --> 00:13:19,718
I've been picked on three times today.

223
00:13:19,762 --> 00:13:22,168
All because of my trousers.

224
00:13:22,221 --> 00:13:23,927
What's wrong with your trousers?

225
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,962
Look at the fucking size of them!

226
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,583
Stop swearing.
There's nothing wrong with them.

227
00:13:28,637 --> 00:13:31,387
- Your dad bought you them.
- They're too big for me!

228
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,795
If you didn't want to wear them,
you should have put your school ones on.

229
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:37,416
It's non-uniform day, Mum.

230
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,090
What do you want me to do, Shaun?
I don't know what to do.

231
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:43,543
- We could move away.
- We can't move away.

232
00:13:43,596 --> 00:13:46,962
We're not moving from anywhere.
We live here and we're staying here.

233
00:13:47,013 --> 00:13:48,802
I don't like it here, Mum.

234
00:13:49,804 --> 00:13:53,003
I liked it better when we were with Dad.

235
00:13:56,262 --> 00:13:59,758
Well, I liked it better when we
was with Dad, but Dad's gone now.

236
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,505
Yes!

237
00:16:19,217 --> 00:16:21,374
Mrs Thatcher's visiting The Antrim

238
00:16:21,426 --> 00:16:24,424
very close to two key events
in the War, for the ship.

239
00:16:25,426 --> 00:16:27,381
Just over there,
in the Falklands Sound,

240
00:16:27,426 --> 00:16:31,715
she was hit aft by a 1,000lb bomb,
which, fortunately, didn't explode,

241
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,749
and there, on Fanning Head,

242
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,706
heavy bombardment from The Antrim
took out a key Argentine position.

243
00:16:38,758 --> 00:16:43,001
Like the Army, the Navy is still taking
the threat of another Argentine attack

244
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,459
very seriously...

245
00:16:58,675 --> 00:17:01,589
as well as these Oerlikon guns,
the destroyer is armed...

246
00:17:03,425 --> 00:17:05,000
sea slug, sea cat...

247
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,214
What the fuck?

248
00:17:14,258 --> 00:17:17,422
What do you want, Gadget?
You've just nearly put my window through.

249
00:17:17,466 --> 00:17:20,500
Woody wants to know
if you're coming hunting.

250
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,464
Hunting? Why?

251
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:26,624
Because he feels sorry
for what happened the other day.

252
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:29,245
And he just wants to know
if you're coming out.

253
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,914
If I come, you're just gonna kick my
head in in the middle of a field.

254
00:17:32,966 --> 00:17:37,042
Woody said if I come within five feet of
you, he's gonna kick the shit out of me.

255
00:17:37,091 --> 00:17:39,626
And why on earth
are you dressed like that?

256
00:17:39,674 --> 00:17:41,546
We always dress like this.

257
00:17:41,591 --> 00:17:43,249
You look stupid.

258
00:17:44,507 --> 00:17:46,830
I know, but it's just a laugh that we have.

259
00:17:46,883 --> 00:17:49,038
I've got you some stuff. Come on.

260
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:52,421
It's not a trick, is it, Gadget?
Woody really wants me to come?

261
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:54,918
It's no trick, honest. Please?

262
00:17:54,965 --> 00:17:57,584
- All right. I'll be down in a minute.
- Hurry up!

263
00:17:58,965 --> 00:18:01,371
Hurry up, you.
Give me a hand.

264
00:18:01,424 --> 00:18:03,414
- Fuck it.
- Come on, Tubs!

265
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:06,250
Hurry up,
cos Gadget won't get over it, will he?

266
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,414
- Come on.
- Come on. Get up.

267
00:18:13,465 --> 00:18:15,953
Here you are.
Gadget, have that. Have this.

268
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:17,997
- Gadget!
- Gadget, have this.

269
00:18:18,048 --> 00:18:19,838
I'll have that there, mate.

270
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:21,422
No, I'm all right.

271
00:18:21,464 --> 00:18:23,455
- Oh, man. Woo!
- I wanted that!

272
00:18:23,506 --> 00:18:25,663
Woo! Woo! Woo-oo!

273
00:18:25,715 --> 00:18:27,089
Come on!

274
00:18:29,214 --> 00:18:31,999
- Where are you going, Gadge?
Whoa-oa-oah!

275
00:18:32,048 --> 00:18:33,541
Woo!

276
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,165
Woo-hoo! Woo!

277
00:18:36,423 --> 00:18:37,998
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

278
00:18:49,423 --> 00:18:51,544
Fuck, yeah! Fucking do it!

279
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,833
Woo!

280
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:55,249
Woody!

281
00:18:56,089 --> 00:18:58,329
Go on! Fucking do it!

282
00:18:58,381 --> 00:18:59,754
Do it again and again!

283
00:18:59,797 --> 00:19:01,954
- You fucking daft bastard.
- You fat bastard.

284
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,910
Go on!

285
00:19:11,922 --> 00:19:12,917
Hey!

286
00:19:19,297 --> 00:19:21,121
Fucking do it! Do it!

287
00:19:21,171 --> 00:19:23,162
Aah!

288
00:19:23,213 --> 00:19:24,588
Shaun!

289
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,455
Aah!

290
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:28,962
Come on!

291
00:19:29,005 --> 00:19:31,672
Come on, Shauny! Come on, Shaun!

292
00:19:31,714 --> 00:19:33,289
Come on, Shaun!

293
00:19:34,963 --> 00:19:36,752
Where are we going?

294
00:19:36,796 --> 00:19:38,787
I'll get you a good seat.

295
00:19:38,838 --> 00:19:40,248
Woo!

296
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,251
Get up them stairs.

297
00:19:46,005 --> 00:19:48,291
Shaun! Shaun, Shaun, Shaun!

298
00:19:54,588 --> 00:19:55,997
Quick!

299
00:19:57,588 --> 00:19:59,792
Come on. Quickly. Quickly. Ssh!

300
00:20:07,421 --> 00:20:09,826
Where the fuck have yous gone?
Come on.

301
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,870
I can't be doing with this, lads.

302
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:13,912
I'm not in the mood for this.

303
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,835
I know yous are in here, I'm not stupid.

304
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,455
So, come out.

305
00:20:21,671 --> 00:20:23,247
Fucker!

306
00:20:27,045 --> 00:20:28,622
Classical!

307
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,997
Classical.

308
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:32,960
- Classic.
Classic. Classic.

309
00:20:33,004 --> 00:20:35,243
Gold, mate. Liquid gold. Brilliant.

310
00:20:35,296 --> 00:20:37,866
That was classic! Classic, classic.

311
00:20:39,212 --> 00:20:41,831
Oi, oi, oi!
What's all that about, dickhead, eh?

312
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:43,750
What's the deal with you, eh?

313
00:20:43,795 --> 00:20:45,999
- He shot me.
- I shot you as well.

314
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:47,207
Come on, Shauny.

315
00:20:47,254 --> 00:20:49,409
- Bloody hell, Gadget.
- What d'you do that for?

316
00:20:49,461 --> 00:20:51,997
Look how yous
have been treating me all day.

317
00:20:52,045 --> 00:20:53,835
I had to carry all the bags.

318
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:56,449
All of yous running off on me,
hiding on me.

319
00:20:56,503 --> 00:20:59,786
Listen to me. He's a young lad.
He's had a fucking bad week.

320
00:20:59,837 --> 00:21:02,835
So, we're bringing him with us
to show him a bloody good time

321
00:21:02,879 --> 00:21:05,082
and you just backhanded him
round t'head.

322
00:21:05,128 --> 00:21:06,751
I'm disappointed, mate.

323
00:21:06,795 --> 00:21:08,998
You're all favouritising him.

324
00:21:09,044 --> 00:21:12,042
I feel like I've gone down in the ranks
since he's come.

325
00:21:12,086 --> 00:21:13,579
What ranks?

326
00:21:13,628 --> 00:21:16,412
I'm sorry if I've took your place, mate.
I really am.

327
00:21:16,461 --> 00:21:20,040
And if you really want me to go
and give you your spot back, I'll just go.

328
00:21:20,086 --> 00:21:22,077
Don't, mate. Please.

329
00:21:22,128 --> 00:21:24,332
- I'll go. He don't like me.
- No, don't.

330
00:21:24,378 --> 00:21:26,369
He don't know what he's saying.

331
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:30,412
It's not that I don't like you, mate.
I think you're great. It's just...

332
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,451
I'm having a shitty time and...

333
00:21:32,502 --> 00:21:35,536
- Come on. Shake hands.
- I've been where you are and...

334
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:39,414
Less of this. It's nonsense, this.
We're mates here. Shake his hand.

335
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,624
Come on. Good lad.
That's what I'm all about. Yeah.

336
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:45,537
Come here, come here.
Give us a bloody hug, come on.

337
00:21:45,586 --> 00:21:48,667
Bloody hell. Come on, all of yous.
All of yous, get in here.

338
00:21:48,711 --> 00:21:51,199
Bloody hell, my arse!
Who's that on my arse?

339
00:21:51,252 --> 00:21:53,243
Who's that? Calm it down.

340
00:21:53,294 --> 00:21:55,083
Bloody hell, Gadge. Come on, mate.

341
00:21:55,127 --> 00:21:57,497
Morning Sun

342
00:21:57,544 --> 00:22:00,825
♪ Way out in the morning sun

343
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:04,666
♪ There lies my baby,
she was waiting so long

344
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,286
♪ Aah aah-aah-aah

345
00:22:06,335 --> 00:22:09,535
♪ Oh, she sing for the sweet melody

346
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:12,871
♪ Oh, Lord, I could hear the harmony

347
00:22:12,918 --> 00:22:15,750
♪ Aah-aah-aah-aah aah-aah-aah...

348
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,825
Wait for me, love.

349
00:22:19,835 --> 00:22:21,457
- I'll see you, chicken.
- See ya.

350
00:22:21,501 --> 00:22:22,698
Them.

351
00:22:25,002 --> 00:22:26,791
- Which ones?
- The big red ones.

352
00:22:26,835 --> 00:22:30,200
Oh, you're not having them, sweetheart.
Look at the size of 'em.

353
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:32,242
Oh, come on, Mum. You said.

354
00:22:32,293 --> 00:22:34,994
No, Shaun, they look like thug boots.
They're awful.

355
00:22:35,042 --> 00:22:36,619
Come on, Mum. You promised me.

356
00:22:36,668 --> 00:22:39,417
Why don't you get some of them
that you've got in blue?

357
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:43,536
Cos I don't like these. I want them ones,
Mum. Come on. You promised.

358
00:22:43,585 --> 00:22:46,499
- They'll rub on your shin.
- They'll only be about that.

359
00:22:46,543 --> 00:22:48,533
Be better in my size.

360
00:22:48,585 --> 00:22:50,575
Come on. Where is she?

361
00:22:50,626 --> 00:22:52,830
- Right.
- Well, that was nice timing.

362
00:22:52,876 --> 00:22:54,452
I spoke too soon.

363
00:22:54,501 --> 00:22:58,080
I hurt my shoulder back there.
Been ferreting about for ages.

364
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:01,159
- Are you all right, love?
- Pulled something in my shoulder.

365
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:03,780
Now, then, if I can just
have that for a second...

366
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:06,369
- Let me have that, sweetheart.
- I want to hold it.

367
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:08,870
I'll just have that. Mum, shall I just...?

368
00:23:08,917 --> 00:23:10,955
- Yeah.
- I'll just put that down there.

369
00:23:11,001 --> 00:23:14,164
Ducky, darling, the ones
that you're looking at, these boots...

370
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:16,199
- Yeah?
...now, they're adult sizes

371
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,287
and you're a size four.

372
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:21,782
But these have just come in from London.

373
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:24,332
Are you ready for these?

374
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,454
These are fantastic.

375
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,988
- What the...?
- Oh, look at them, Shaun.

376
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,997
They're absolutely lovely.

377
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:34,365
- Do you want to hold one? There.
- Oh, my God.

378
00:23:34,417 --> 00:23:36,987
- They're nice, aren't they?
- They're lovely, them.

379
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,451
Oh, they look lovely.

380
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,786
- Try 'em on.
- Where's the "Doc Marten" sign?

381
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:43,665
These ones, cos they're special
and they're from London,

382
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:47,204
they don't have the Doc Marten sign
on these - they're too special for that.

383
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:51,456
- It says "Tompkins" in it.
- The ones from London say Tompkins.

384
00:23:51,499 --> 00:23:53,490
Everywhere else say "Dr Martens".

385
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,578
- I love them.
- These ones are special.

386
00:23:55,624 --> 00:23:58,196
- Do you sell a lot of them?
- Yeah. Go like hot cakes.

387
00:23:58,249 --> 00:23:59,826
Do you want to try one on? Shall we?

388
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,533
I fucking want them.

389
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:04,036
- If you swear... I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

390
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:06,369
- Shaun, don't swear.
- I want them ones.

391
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:08,656
- Listen, you can...
- I don't want them.

392
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:11,409
Chicken, don't upset your mum, eh?
Let's try 'em on.

393
00:24:11,457 --> 00:24:13,662
Are you ready, Shaun?
- Yeah.

394
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:15,164
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

395
00:24:15,207 --> 00:24:17,577
- You don't seem very confident.
- Just do it.

396
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:21,155
Your mum's not gonna come round,
is she, and whack my door down?

397
00:24:21,207 --> 00:24:22,997
No. Just fricking do it.

398
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,280
Right. Here we go.

399
00:24:26,374 --> 00:24:28,365
- Get that mop off.
- It's coming.

400
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,453
It's coming off.

401
00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:32,490
- Oh, eh.
Ooh!

402
00:24:34,374 --> 00:24:36,163
Flippin' heck. Eh.

403
00:24:36,207 --> 00:24:38,991
- You have a right pink head.
- We're getting going now.

404
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,742
- Stop fidgeting.
- You're doing a good job, mate.

405
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:44,077
Oh, mate, it looks better already, that.

406
00:24:44,124 --> 00:24:46,576
- Don't it, Milk?
- Definitely. Definitely.

407
00:24:46,623 --> 00:24:48,614
- You're looking good.
- Head down.

408
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:53,158
Oh, there's loads of it.
It's just never-ending.

409
00:24:53,206 --> 00:24:56,121
Don't be rough with him, Lol.
He's only a baby.

410
00:24:57,206 --> 00:25:00,288
- Put your head up.
- You just told me to put it down, Lol.

411
00:25:00,331 --> 00:25:02,655
And what an hairline, girls, eh?

412
00:25:02,707 --> 00:25:04,496
Don't forget that bit.

413
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,115
I can see it.

414
00:25:06,206 --> 00:25:08,576
Honestly, mate, it's sterling.

415
00:25:09,665 --> 00:25:11,038
Get it off.

416
00:25:11,081 --> 00:25:13,783
Really smart, in't he? In't he smart, eh?

417
00:25:13,831 --> 00:25:16,498
- He does look good.
- Mate, I'm well impressed.

418
00:25:17,581 --> 00:25:19,986
There we go, mate. That's you done.

419
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:21,496
Look at that!

420
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:23,992
Brush him down. He looks like a Yeti!

421
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:26,610
- Oh, mate, so smart, that.
- That's good, that.

422
00:25:26,664 --> 00:25:28,655
Honestly, mate, you look sterling.

423
00:25:28,706 --> 00:25:30,827
- So, am I in the gang now?
- Well, not yet.

424
00:25:30,873 --> 00:25:33,112
Get your shirt on.
Let's see your Ben Sherman.

425
00:25:33,206 --> 00:25:35,161
I... I ain't got a Ben Sherman.

426
00:25:35,205 --> 00:25:37,777
- You telling me you've not got a shirt?
- No.

427
00:25:37,831 --> 00:25:39,656
You told me to get jeans and the boots.

428
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:42,822
Are you having a laugh?
You can't go out all nipply, can you?

429
00:25:42,873 --> 00:25:46,238
You're gonna have to come back next week.
I'll see you, mate.

430
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:49,820
- Honestly, have I really gotta go?
- Yeah, really, really.

431
00:25:49,873 --> 00:25:51,662
Go on. You're gonna have to get off.

432
00:25:51,706 --> 00:25:53,909
Shut t'door behind you,
there's a good lad.

433
00:25:54,913 --> 00:25:56,987
Oh, hang on, I forgot about summat.

434
00:25:57,038 --> 00:25:58,697
I were fucking lying!

435
00:25:59,664 --> 00:26:02,234
Come here and give me a big hug.
Come here, fella.

436
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:06,117
I'm really proud of you, mate.
You look brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

437
00:26:06,205 --> 00:26:08,824
Get that body covered up
before t'girls go mad!

438
00:26:08,872 --> 00:26:09,866
Ooh!

439
00:26:09,913 --> 00:26:12,484
Amazing. Bang on.

440
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:14,528
Lol picked that for you.

441
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,661
- Look at that.
- It's a good fit, that. It's a good fit.

442
00:26:17,705 --> 00:26:19,327
Let's have a look at you.

443
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:20,568
Ah, mate.

444
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,778
What a transformation!

445
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,488
He looks dead cute.

446
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:25,996
Pleased with it?

447
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:27,994
- Look at that.
- Ah, mate.

448
00:26:28,038 --> 00:26:29,863
Bloody hell, here he is.
- Gadget!

449
00:26:29,913 --> 00:26:32,448
Look at this.
- What? Who are you?

450
00:26:32,496 --> 00:26:34,487
Oh-ho-ho, Shaun!

451
00:26:34,538 --> 00:26:37,156
Oh-ho-ho! Look at that. Come here.

452
00:26:37,204 --> 00:26:38,828
That's it. Good lad, Gadge.

453
00:26:38,871 --> 00:26:40,412

00:28:38,827 --> 00:28:41,991
- It's all right round here, Shaun.
- It's a nice area, mate.

491
00:28:42,035 --> 00:28:44,405
Cheers for today.
It's been the best day of my life.

492
00:28:44,451 --> 00:28:45,649
Aw.

493
00:28:45,702 --> 00:28:47,491
Fella, man,
you are more than welcome.

494
00:28:47,535 --> 00:28:49,988
And I mean that
from the bottom of my heart. Any time.

495
00:28:50,035 --> 00:28:51,907
- Tell him.
- Definitely. Any time, mate.

496
00:28:51,994 --> 00:28:54,482
- Come here, you.
Any time, day or night.

497
00:28:54,535 --> 00:28:56,525
Oh, oh!
Woo!

498
00:28:56,577 --> 00:28:58,698
- Wa-hey!
- You've been practising!

499
00:28:58,743 --> 00:29:00,781
Cheers for the haircut, Lol.

500
00:29:00,827 --> 00:29:04,026
No worries. You make sure you come to
me when it needs redoing.

501
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:07,109
- Cheers for the shitty tea, Gadget.
- Get you!

502
00:29:10,868 --> 00:29:11,862
Shaun?

503
00:29:12,868 --> 00:29:13,862
Yeah?

504
00:29:15,076 --> 00:29:16,699
Come here, please.

505
00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:19,650
I just want to go straight to bed, Mum.

506
00:29:19,701 --> 00:29:22,368
Come here, please.
You're two hours late.

507
00:29:23,285 --> 00:29:26,033
- Please, Mum.
- Shaun, just come here!

508
00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:37,116
Oh, my God.

509
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:42,401
Mum, please.

510
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,908
Please, Mum.

511
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:45,982
- Shaun, come on.
- Oh, man.

512
00:29:46,033 --> 00:29:48,487
- Oh, Mum, please.
- I'm not messing around.

513
00:29:48,534 --> 00:29:50,074
Now, in.

514
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,776
In you go, you.

515
00:29:52,825 --> 00:29:54,401
- Eh, Shaun!
- Shaun, mate!

516
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,907
- Oh.
- Oh.

517
00:29:57,075 --> 00:29:58,568
Who's Lol?

518
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,195
Me.

519
00:30:02,242 --> 00:30:04,233
What have you done to his hair?

520
00:30:06,075 --> 00:30:10,069
I... I did ask him, before I did it, if...
if you was all right with it.

521
00:30:10,117 --> 00:30:12,072
Don't you think
you should have asked me?

522
00:30:12,117 --> 00:30:13,112
Yeah.

523
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,776
I'm sorry.

524
00:30:14,825 --> 00:30:16,981
Shaun, did I not ask you
if it was all right?

525
00:30:17,033 --> 00:30:19,319
If he said, "Jump off a cliff",
would you do that?

526
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,648
No.

527
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,528
To be honest, you all look a bit... old
to be hanging around with him.

528
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:28,822
I'm only in the er... year bel...
above in school.

529
00:30:28,867 --> 00:30:31,236
- Are you joking?
- No.

530
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:34,656
I've got problems.

531
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:39,279
Yeah, well, you will have problems
if you touch his hair again.

532
00:30:39,324 --> 00:30:41,398
I'm really sorry.
- Who's Woody?

533
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:43,438
Behave.

534
00:30:43,491 --> 00:30:46,406
- I'm Woody. I'm sorry, love.
- No, it's fine.

535
00:30:46,449 --> 00:30:47,776
It's erm...

536
00:30:47,824 --> 00:30:51,818
I just wanted to thank you. He said he's
being bullied and you'd helped him out.

537
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:54,780
- You're welcome.
- Yeah, I really appreciate that.

538
00:30:54,824 --> 00:30:58,485
And the clothes and stuff. I think he likes 'em.
I don't mind that, at all.

539
00:30:58,532 --> 00:31:00,322
But the hair is not good.

540
00:31:00,365 --> 00:31:01,775
I'm really sorry.

541
00:31:01,824 --> 00:31:05,520
I am. I wouldn't have done it
if I knew you didn't like it.

542
00:31:05,574 --> 00:31:08,027
Listen, I'm gonna leave him here with you.

543
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,229
I'm gonna trust you, Shaun.

544
00:31:10,282 --> 00:31:11,858
All right? Give us a kiss.

545
00:31:12,866 --> 00:31:16,277
- See you later. Nice to meet you.
What's your name, love?

546
00:31:16,323 --> 00:31:18,397
- Cynthia.
- Nice to meet you, Cynthia.

547
00:31:18,448 --> 00:31:19,989
Nice to meet you all.

548
00:31:20,031 --> 00:31:22,069
- See you in a bit, Shaun.
- See you, love.

549
00:31:22,115 --> 00:31:24,105
- See you, later.
- Bye, Mum.

550
00:31:24,156 --> 00:31:25,566
You idiot!

551
00:31:26,574 --> 00:31:28,114
You shit yourself.

552
00:31:28,198 --> 00:31:29,146
What?

553
00:31:29,198 --> 00:31:31,652
- You shit yourself. You did.
- I didn't shit myself.

554
00:31:35,574 --> 00:31:37,114
Hey, here he is!

555
00:31:37,198 --> 00:31:39,817
- Where have you been?
- I've been getting a drink.

556
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:43,028
- You've been gone an hour.
- Look how pissed he is. Babycham?

557
00:31:43,073 --> 00:31:44,862
Have you had it through a straw?

558
00:31:44,906 --> 00:31:46,813
Wakey-wakey!

559
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:48,985
Pissed as a fart. Look at him.

560
00:31:51,865 --> 00:31:53,985
You fancy Smell, don't you?

561
00:31:54,031 --> 00:31:55,310
- Ah!
- No.

562
00:31:55,364 --> 00:31:56,691
Do you like Smell?

563
00:31:57,698 --> 00:32:00,649
Listen, I think, Shaun...
I think you've got a great chance.

564
00:32:00,698 --> 00:32:03,020
- Oh, aye, love.
- You ain't got nothing to lose.

565
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,779
- Go on.
- She can only say no, mate.

566
00:32:04,823 --> 00:32:06,813
You wanna give it a crack?

567
00:32:06,865 --> 00:32:08,820
This can be a beautiful thing.

568
00:32:08,865 --> 00:32:10,984
- Oh, my God. Fuckin' hell.
- Boob height.

569
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,986
That might be the perfect height.

570
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,440
Would you...

571
00:32:14,489 --> 00:32:16,646
like to take a turn up the garden with me?

572
00:32:16,698 --> 00:32:18,818
Oh, that's sweet.

573
00:32:18,864 --> 00:32:20,771
You are, you're a little sweetheart.

574
00:32:20,822 --> 00:32:22,777
I told you. It's making me emotional.

575
00:32:24,197 --> 00:32:25,571
Ladies first.

576
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:27,154
Come on, then.
- Watch it.

577
00:32:27,197 --> 00:32:29,354
- Ooh, sorry, mate.
- It's all right.

578
00:32:33,197 --> 00:32:36,029
- Look at the sky.
- This is perfect, this is.

579
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:39,145
Look at the moonlight. It's beautiful.

580
00:32:39,197 --> 00:32:40,654
Like you.

581
00:32:42,655 --> 00:32:44,231
That is so cute.

582
00:32:45,238 --> 00:32:47,229
You're a real charmer, you are.

583
00:32:49,238 --> 00:32:50,648
Careful.

584
00:32:52,238 --> 00:32:53,696
It were just...

585
00:32:56,864 --> 00:32:58,771
What the fuck's that?

586
00:32:58,822 --> 00:33:00,977
That sounds like the coppers,
that does.

587
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:02,653
Gary.

588
00:33:02,697 --> 00:33:03,691
Gadget!

589
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:05,983
It's Gadget's mum and dad.

590
00:33:06,029 --> 00:33:08,980
Get the fuck up, Gadge. Listen to me.
I want you to be sober. Yeah?

591
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,024
Sober.

592
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,062
All nice, good, sober.

593
00:33:12,113 --> 00:33:14,103
- I am sober.
- Of course you are.

594
00:33:14,196 --> 00:33:16,767
Fucking hide all the weed an' that, Milk.

595
00:33:20,487 --> 00:33:21,767
Hello?

596
00:33:21,821 --> 00:33:23,811
- Aaargh!
- Get fucking out!

597
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:34,059
Outside now!

598
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:37,193
If you want us to turn
the music down, we'll turn it down.

599
00:33:37,237 --> 00:33:39,856
It's too fucking late for that!

600
00:33:39,904 --> 00:33:41,396
These three.

601
00:33:41,445 --> 00:33:43,566
Now get fucking up! Come on.

602
00:33:43,612 --> 00:33:45,852
I'm coming, just...
- Not you. You.

603
00:33:45,903 --> 00:33:47,527
Get outside!

604
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:49,146
Woody!
- Now!

605
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:50,653
Come on!

606
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:52,402
- It's all right.
- Kes, get up.

607
00:33:52,445 --> 00:33:54,436
Yaaah!

608
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:01,813
Look at him! Fucking hell, Combo!

609
00:34:01,862 --> 00:34:03,817
Fucking hell, look at you!

610
00:34:03,862 --> 00:34:06,101
Look at the fucking size of him.

611
00:34:06,195 --> 00:34:08,352
Wow! Fucking look at you!

612
00:34:10,361 --> 00:34:13,194
- Oh, fucking hell!
- Fucking look at you, man!

613
00:34:13,237 --> 00:34:15,026
- Fucking hell.
- I missed you, man.

614
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:18,151
Fuck off, man. You fucking gave me
a heart attack, you bastard.

615
00:34:18,194 --> 00:34:19,652
Who the fuck's he?

616
00:34:19,695 --> 00:34:21,104
- Banjo.
- Banjo.

617
00:34:23,778 --> 00:34:26,349
Three and a half years
with this fucking big bastard.

618
00:34:26,403 --> 00:34:27,860
You lovely man.

619
00:34:27,903 --> 00:34:31,233
Tell you what, there's fuck all
that this man hasn't seen.

620
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:34,478
Banjo, yeah?
Thanks for looking after him, mate.

621
00:34:34,528 --> 00:34:37,230
- Look at the size of him, mate.
- Always ready to have a go.

622
00:34:37,278 --> 00:34:39,067
Meggy! How are you, lad?

623
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:41,101
- How are you, mate?
- I'm all right.

624
00:34:41,194 --> 00:34:42,770
Milk, fucking hell.

625
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:44,809
You shit me up there for a minute.

626
00:34:44,861 --> 00:34:46,816
Listen to me now. This dude, here,

627
00:34:46,861 --> 00:34:50,440
he spent three years in the pen for me,
he never said nothing.

628
00:34:50,486 --> 00:34:53,021
If it weren't for him,
I wouldn't be with you guys now.

629
00:34:53,069 --> 00:34:55,309
So, the utmost respect and I mean it.

630
00:34:55,361 --> 00:34:56,818
I mean it.

631
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,353
Look at this, eh?

632
00:34:58,402 --> 00:35:01,850
Look at you. Fucking hell!
You've blossomed, haven't you, love?

633
00:35:01,902 --> 00:35:04,307
- How are you doing?
- Not too bad. How are you?

634
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,228
All right. Easy, easy.
That's my other half, that.

635
00:35:08,235 --> 00:35:10,771
- It's my other half, like.
- Nice one, mate.

636
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:12,856
I'm happy for yous.

637
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,977
Are you all right?

638
00:35:15,985 --> 00:35:16,979
Yeah.

639
00:35:17,026 --> 00:35:18,817
You look a bit nervous.

640
00:35:18,861 --> 00:35:21,431
I'm not gonna do anything
you don't want me to.

641
00:35:22,901 --> 00:35:24,892
Have you ever done this before?

642
00:35:24,985 --> 00:35:26,394
Done it once.

643
00:35:26,443 --> 00:35:27,817
In Germany.

644
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,353
In Germany?

645
00:35:29,402 --> 00:35:31,641
Why did you go to Germany?

646
00:35:31,693 --> 00:35:33,186
I was...

647
00:35:33,235 --> 00:35:35,805
in Ger... Germany with my dad.

648
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,431
What did you do in Germany
with this girl?

649
00:35:38,484 --> 00:35:40,061
Just kissed her.

650
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,314
Did you? Was she pretty?

651
00:35:43,442 --> 00:35:45,729
Prettier than me?

652
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:47,565
- No way.
- Really?

653
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,350
Well, that's really cute of you.

654
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,433
Do you want a kiss?

655
00:35:57,192 --> 00:35:59,183
We'll leave it today.

656
00:36:10,817 --> 00:36:13,981
You might look about four,
but you kiss like a forty-year-old.

657
00:36:14,025 --> 00:36:16,016
You're dead sensitive.

658
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:18,851
Are you all right?

659
00:36:20,817 --> 00:36:22,014
Are you sure?

660
00:36:23,025 --> 00:36:25,016
Do you want me to kiss you again?

661
00:36:40,817 --> 00:36:42,606
Do you wanna suck my tits?

662
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:45,648
- Tell 'em a story.
- All right, if yous are making me.

663
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:48,979
All right, it took a little bit of time.

664
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:51,560
- But we did end up running things.
- We certainly did.

665
00:36:51,608 --> 00:36:54,725
I mean, it's just...
I mean, for three weeks, right,

666
00:36:54,775 --> 00:36:57,144
this fucking wog...

667
00:36:57,191 --> 00:36:59,763
Right? Proper horrible.

668
00:37:01,774 --> 00:37:03,184
Sorry, mate, sorry.

669
00:37:03,275 --> 00:37:05,431
Didn't mean nothing by it.

670
00:37:05,483 --> 00:37:08,232
You know, just slip of the tongue, like.

671
00:37:08,275 --> 00:37:10,845
Sorry. This, you know,
this brown gentleman...

672
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,852
who... he was a bully,
he was a horrible bully.

673
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,269
No matter what colour he was,
he was a bully.

674
00:37:17,316 --> 00:37:19,307
- And I hate bullies. Don't I, Wood?
- Yeah.

675
00:37:19,357 --> 00:37:21,680
I can't stand them, man.
I can't stand 'em.

676
00:37:21,732 --> 00:37:25,181
But for three weeks, right,
this fella was robbing my pudding.

677
00:37:25,274 --> 00:37:27,064
What kind of pudding was it?

678
00:37:27,108 --> 00:37:29,098
Doesn't matter what pudding it was.

679
00:37:29,148 --> 00:37:30,891
The pudding's not the point.

680
00:37:30,941 --> 00:37:34,270
The point is,
he was taking my pudding off me.

681
00:37:34,315 --> 00:37:37,099
And I just thought,
"Nah, I'm not having it. I don't care.

682
00:37:37,148 --> 00:37:39,388
You're not getting my pudding,
that's it."

683
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,723
So, I grabbed it and I've gone,
"No, mate, no, you're not having it."

684
00:37:42,774 --> 00:37:44,350
He was like...

685
00:37:44,399 --> 00:37:46,520
"White boy...

686
00:37:46,566 --> 00:37:48,640
Give me your pud-pud."

687
00:37:49,857 --> 00:37:53,519
Proper! Do you know what I mean?
And I've just thought, "No, man."

688
00:37:53,566 --> 00:37:55,721
Nah, he did, right.

689
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,764
Eh!

690
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,346
Look at t'moosh on him.
- Smell his finger.

691
00:38:03,773 --> 00:38:05,764
And who's been bloody smooching?

692
00:38:06,731 --> 00:38:08,603
Come here, Shaun! Come on, man.

693
00:38:09,606 --> 00:38:12,521
I've got someone I want you to meet.
Come and stand here.

694
00:38:12,565 --> 00:38:15,432
Now, listen to me.
This is a very special friend of mine.

695
00:38:15,481 --> 00:38:17,058
Combo, Shaun.

696
00:38:17,107 --> 00:38:18,599
Newest recruit.

697
00:38:18,648 --> 00:38:20,140
Shaun. Combo.

698
00:38:20,189 --> 00:38:21,730
What are you doing?

699
00:38:21,773 --> 00:38:23,847
Just want to shake your hand.

700
00:38:23,898 --> 00:38:25,474
Did you?

701
00:38:28,398 --> 00:38:30,933
Are you a proper little skinhead,
then, yeah?

702
00:38:31,856 --> 00:38:32,850
Yeah.

703
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:37,138
You look like a little Action Man.

704
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:41,100
Like a little Barbie doll.
You're dressed up an' all that. Look.

705
00:38:41,147 --> 00:38:42,640
What?

706
00:38:46,106 --> 00:38:48,641
I'm only messing with
you, you little fucker.

707
00:38:48,689 --> 00:38:50,679
I'm only messing with you.

708
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:53,184
He's all right.
- You're all right.

709
00:38:53,273 --> 00:38:56,140
Nice one, lad.
Sit down, anyway, I'm telling a story.

710
00:38:56,189 --> 00:38:57,646
Sit next to Milky.

711
00:39:01,313 --> 00:39:03,637
Anyway, where was I?
What... Where was I?

712
00:39:03,689 --> 00:39:06,722
You were on about that er...
"brown gentleman"

713
00:39:06,772 --> 00:39:08,561
stealing your "pud-pud".

714
00:39:08,605 --> 00:39:12,516
That's right, yeah. Yeah.
So, I've said, "No, you're not having it."

715
00:39:12,564 --> 00:39:15,727
This one day, right,
I've been grafting all morning,

716
00:39:15,772 --> 00:39:19,054
just shovelling shit, constantly,
all morning, non-stop.

717
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:20,846
Weren't I? And I'm fucking starving.

718
00:39:20,896 --> 00:39:22,306
♪ Gentle piano

719
00:39:22,355 --> 00:39:24,096
You know, like that proper hunger.

720
00:39:24,146 --> 00:39:28,271
And I'm thinking, "Right, just eat my
pudding, just go and eat my pudding."

721
00:39:28,313 --> 00:39:31,347
I've just finished
the last fucking mouthful and then,

722
00:39:31,397 --> 00:39:34,596
this big, black, sweaty hand

723
00:39:34,646 --> 00:39:37,431
has just gone wallop, right in my pudding.

724
00:39:37,479 --> 00:39:39,270
Do you know what I mean?

725
00:39:39,313 --> 00:39:43,436
Proper big cigar fingers,
all over my fucking crumble and custard...

726
00:39:44,437 --> 00:39:46,843
I just thought,
"No, I'm not having it, I don't care.

727
00:39:46,896 --> 00:39:49,680
You're not getting my pudding, that's it."

728
00:39:49,729 --> 00:39:53,474
I just took his hand out and just looked
him right in the face and I've gone...

729
00:40:03,563 --> 00:40:04,641
Woody.

730
00:40:30,854 --> 00:40:33,058
So, last night was good fun, weren't it?

731
00:40:33,104 --> 00:40:36,469
- Don't start.
- I'm just saying, a really good night.

732
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,720
I know what sort of a bloody night it was.
It were awkward.

733
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,436
It was er... a little on the tense side.

734
00:40:42,478 --> 00:40:44,469
I know, mate, I'm sorry.

735
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,933
I knew he'd do it. I knew he'd have to
throw his bloody weight around.

736
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:49,601
Has to be number one.

737
00:40:49,645 --> 00:40:52,975
He were like that before he went in.
Nowt's frigging changed, at all.

738
00:40:53,061 --> 00:40:55,550
Hang on. Wait.
He hardly did anything wrong, anyway.

739
00:40:55,603 --> 00:40:57,972
- I thought he was all right.
- I've got an idea.

740
00:40:58,061 --> 00:41:01,225
How about you climb out of his arse
for five minutes, Puke, eh?

741
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,344
Trust you to fucking jump on his dick.

742
00:41:03,395 --> 00:41:06,179
I'm not. I'm just saying,
he was just telling a story.

743
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:08,225
You asked for a story, he told it you.

744
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:10,674
I'll tell you a story
if you don't shut your mouth.

745
00:41:15,602 --> 00:41:17,060
All right, boys?

746
00:41:17,103 --> 00:41:19,177
- You all right, Combo?
- All right, Gadge.

747
00:41:19,228 --> 00:41:21,053
- Puke.
- All right, mate.

748
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:23,342
'Ey up. What's up?

749
00:41:23,394 --> 00:41:26,475
- Can I just have a little word with you?
- I've got a brew coming.

750
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:29,055
- Only be two minutes. Come 'ed.
- Bastard.

751
00:41:29,102 --> 00:41:31,176
Woody, don't be long cos I wanna get off.

752
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:33,473
- All right, love.
- Be two minutes, Lol.

753
00:41:35,435 --> 00:41:36,928
All right, lad?

754
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:40,726
I said, "All right?"

755
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:43,601
What was that for? That hurt!

756
00:41:43,644 --> 00:41:46,642
- Woody, hurry up.
- I will, love, yeah.

757
00:41:50,185 --> 00:41:53,183
Milky, I'd watch it.
I think summat's gonna kick off.

758
00:41:53,269 --> 00:41:55,554
Don't worry. I'm more than ready.

759
00:41:55,601 --> 00:41:58,055
You're making a big deal
out of nothing, anyway.

760
00:41:58,102 --> 00:41:59,559
- He's all right.
- He's not.

761
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:00,596
Kel!

762
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,681
Kelly, you don't even know him.

763
00:42:05,935 --> 00:42:08,056
- What's up?
You all right, Woods?

764
00:42:08,102 --> 00:42:10,092
All right, lad.

765
00:42:13,184 --> 00:42:15,720
- Go on, then. What's happened?
- We've to...

766
00:42:15,768 --> 00:42:17,925
We've to bob round tomorrow morning.

767
00:42:37,101 --> 00:42:41,095
I tell you, I shouldn't be here, you know.
This don't feel good, at all.

768
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:44,554
Look at the size of that brew.
Who drinks a brew that big?

769
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:54,516
I bet you all thought I was a right fucking
horrible, horrible, horrible

770
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:56,715
little bastard the other day, didn't you?

771
00:42:56,767 --> 00:42:58,722
- A little bit.
- A bit?

772
00:42:58,767 --> 00:43:01,765
Tell the truth, Wood, man.
I was fucking horrible, weren't I?

773
00:43:01,851 --> 00:43:03,556
- A bit of a bastard, man.
- Yeah.

774
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,591
Yeah, well, you were a snake.

775
00:43:07,141 --> 00:43:09,761
You were a fucking serpent
from the Bible, weren't you?

776
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:14,175
Do you wanna know why, Wood?
Do you want me to tell you why?

777
00:43:14,267 --> 00:43:15,261
Yeah?

778
00:43:16,267 --> 00:43:18,553
Cos see that man, there, Milky?

779
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:21,051
That man there

780
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,722
took abuse off me.

781
00:43:23,766 --> 00:43:26,883
And I said some horrible things, Milk,
and I'm fucking sorry.

782
00:43:27,891 --> 00:43:29,633
You let me abuse him.

783
00:43:29,683 --> 00:43:32,385
And what did you do?
What did you do, Wood?

784
00:43:32,433 --> 00:43:34,719
- I didn't do anything.
- I can't hear you.

785
00:43:34,766 --> 00:43:37,717
- I didn't do nothing.
- Exactly. Nothing. Fuck all.

786
00:43:37,766 --> 00:43:39,343
Neither did any of yous.

787
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:42,673
Not one of yous stood up
and made yourself count for that man there.

788
00:43:42,724 --> 00:43:44,929
And that was fucking wrong.

789
00:43:45,933 --> 00:43:49,713
Milk, honest to God,
I'm really glad you came here today.

790
00:43:49,766 --> 00:43:51,887
And I mean that, mate,
I really mean that.

791
00:43:52,891 --> 00:43:56,054
Cos I've got one question to ask you.
Just one question.

792
00:43:56,099 --> 00:44:00,922
When you've heard it, if you want to leave,
you can leave, that's fine by me.

793
00:44:00,974 --> 00:44:02,964
But I've got one question to ask you.

794
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:05,053
Do you consider yourself

795
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:06,888
English or Jamaican?

796
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,549
English.

797
00:44:28,974 --> 00:44:32,718
Lovely. I love you for that.
That's fucking great. I'm proud, man.

798
00:44:32,765 --> 00:44:35,253
Learn from him.
That's a proud man, there.

799
00:44:37,765 --> 00:44:39,554
That's what we need, man.

800
00:44:39,598 --> 00:44:41,968
That's what this nation
has been built on.

801
00:44:42,056 --> 00:44:45,220
Proud men. Proud fucking warriors.

802
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:49,258
Two thousand years,
this little tiny fucking island

803
00:44:49,306 --> 00:44:51,511
has been raped and pillaged

804
00:44:51,557 --> 00:44:54,554
by people who have come here
and wanted a piece of it.

805
00:44:54,598 --> 00:44:58,177
Two fucking world wars,
men have laid down their lives for this.

806
00:44:59,181 --> 00:45:01,219
For this, and for what?

807
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:03,835
So we can stick our fucking flag
in the ground and say,

808
00:45:03,889 --> 00:45:05,595
"Yeah, this is England

809
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:07,216
and this is England

810
00:45:07,265 --> 00:45:08,840
and this is England."

811
00:45:11,139 --> 00:45:12,929
And for what?

812
00:45:12,973 --> 00:45:15,010
For what now?

813
00:45:15,056 --> 00:45:17,047
Eh, what for?

814
00:45:18,056 --> 00:45:21,338
So we can just open the fucking floodgates
and let them all come in?

815
00:45:21,389 --> 00:45:23,260
And say, "Yeah, come on, come in.

816
00:45:23,305 --> 00:45:26,387
Get off your ship. Did you have
a safe journey? Was it hard?

817
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:29,263
Here y'are, here's a corner,
why don't you build a shop?

818
00:45:29,305 --> 00:45:32,718
Better still, why don't you build a shop
and then build a church?

819
00:45:32,764 --> 00:45:35,715
Follow your own fucking religions.
Do what you want."

820
00:45:35,764 --> 00:45:39,971
When there's single fucking parents
out there, who can't get a fucking flat

821
00:45:40,013 --> 00:45:42,051
and they're being given to these...

822
00:45:42,097 --> 00:45:45,344
And I'm gonna say it,
cos you're gonna have to fucking hear it.

823
00:45:45,389 --> 00:45:48,836
We're giving the flats
to these fucking Pakis. Right?

824
00:45:48,888 --> 00:45:53,178
Who've got 50 and 60
in a fucking flat on their own.

825
00:45:53,264 --> 00:45:55,502
Right? We're giving that to them.

826
00:45:55,555 --> 00:45:58,636
There's three and a half million
unemployed out there.

827
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:02,046
Three and a half million of us,
who can't find fucking work.

828
00:46:02,097 --> 00:46:05,260
Cos they're taking them all.
Cos it's fucking cheap labour.

829
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,881
Cheap and easy labour.

830
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:10,342
Fucking cheap and easy,
which makes us cheap and easy.

831
00:46:10,388 --> 00:46:12,674
Three and a half fucking million!

832
00:46:12,721 --> 00:46:15,174
It's not a joke. It's not a fucking joke.

833
00:46:15,221 --> 00:46:19,215
And that Thatcher sits there
in her fucking ivory tower

834
00:46:19,263 --> 00:46:21,882
and sends us on a fucking phoney war!

835
00:46:21,929 --> 00:46:23,303
The Falklands?

836
00:46:23,346 --> 00:46:25,135
The fucking Falklands?

837
00:46:25,179 --> 00:46:27,170
What the fuck's The Falklands?

838
00:46:27,263 --> 00:46:30,214
Fucking innocent men,
good fucking strong men.

839
00:46:30,263 --> 00:46:33,426
Good soldiers,
real people losing their lives,

840
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:36,505
going over there thinking
they're fighting for a fucking cause.

841
00:46:36,555 --> 00:46:39,339
What are they fighting for?
What are they fighting against?

842
00:46:39,388 --> 00:46:41,673
Fucking shepherds!
Shepherds with fucking...

843
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,711
Shut up about The Falklands.

844
00:46:43,762 --> 00:46:45,339
- Why?
- Cos I want you to.

845
00:46:45,388 --> 00:46:48,385
There's fucking loads of dickheads dying
out there for nothing.

846
00:46:48,428 --> 00:46:50,633
My fucking dad weren't a dickhead!

847
00:46:50,679 --> 00:46:51,958
What are you doing?

848
00:46:52,054 --> 00:46:54,045
- Fuck off! Shut up!
- What am I doing wrong?

849
00:46:54,096 --> 00:46:56,500
Whoa, there, little one.
What's wrong, mate?

850
00:46:56,554 --> 00:46:59,090
- Tell me the truth. Come on.
- I just fucking...

851
00:46:59,136 --> 00:47:00,594
That's it. Go on.

852
00:47:00,637 --> 00:47:02,628
My fucking dad died in that war!

853
00:47:02,679 --> 00:47:04,669
- Your dad died?
- Yeah. Get off!

854
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,718
- Fucking hell, mate, I'm sorry.
- Fucking shut up about it!

855
00:47:08,762 --> 00:47:10,219
I'm sorry, mate.

856
00:47:10,262 --> 00:47:12,086
Fucking hell, I'm sorry, lad.

857
00:47:13,095 --> 00:47:15,050
I'm sorry. I never knew he died, man.

858
00:47:15,095 --> 00:47:16,505
Fucking hell.

859
00:47:16,554 --> 00:47:18,544
Oh, look, mate, if I'd have known,

860
00:47:18,595 --> 00:47:22,126
honest, I wouldn't have said, man,
but what I'm telling you is the truth.

861
00:47:22,178 --> 00:47:25,295
I can't lie to you.
It's a pathetic war, man.

862
00:47:25,345 --> 00:47:28,627
And you want your dad's life
to mean something, don't you?

863
00:47:28,678 --> 00:47:31,048
And this breaks my fucking heart to say it.

864
00:47:31,095 --> 00:47:33,085
We shouldn't have been there.

865
00:47:33,136 --> 00:47:36,051
She lied to us.
She lied to me. She lied to you.

866
00:47:36,095 --> 00:47:38,583
But, most importantly,
she lied to your dad.

867
00:47:38,636 --> 00:47:43,340
If you don't stand up and fight this fucking
fight that's going on on the streets,

868
00:47:43,386 --> 00:47:45,590
your dad died for nothing.

869
00:47:45,636 --> 00:47:47,425
He died for nothing.

870
00:47:47,469 --> 00:47:49,590
You've got to carry it on, man, in here.

871
00:47:50,553 --> 00:47:54,333
In your little fucking heart,
you've got the pride of your dad, man.

872
00:47:58,094 --> 00:47:59,373
Fucking hell.

873
00:48:00,761 --> 00:48:04,091
That little fucking whippersnapper
has set the standard.

874
00:48:05,094 --> 00:48:08,045
- Can you believe that, Banj?
- You can't, can you, at that age?

875
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:09,373
Fucking hell.

876
00:48:09,427 --> 00:48:10,884
What a gem.

877
00:48:10,927 --> 00:48:12,716
What a fucking gem.

878
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,253
All right, look.

879
00:48:23,677 --> 00:48:25,667
There's the line, boys.

880
00:48:25,718 --> 00:48:28,503
That means
you're all quite welcome to just leave

881
00:48:28,552 --> 00:48:31,834
and leave now and never come back
and that's it, the end of it.

882
00:48:32,844 --> 00:48:34,633
But if you wanna stay,

883
00:48:34,677 --> 00:48:36,466
this is a proper fight.

884
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:40,338
Now yous all either cross that line
and go your merry little way...

885
00:48:41,343 --> 00:48:44,175
or you stay where you are
and you come with me.

886
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:46,131
The choice is yours, boys.

887
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,546
Fucking hell!
That was a bit quick, weren't it?

888
00:48:50,593 --> 00:48:53,046
I ain't being fucking brainwashed, Combo.

889
00:48:53,093 --> 00:48:55,498
Oh, listen to fucking Sigmund Void there.

890
00:48:55,552 --> 00:48:58,714
You're well out of line.
Well out of line, man.

891
00:48:58,759 --> 00:49:00,750
Come on, lads, let's have you.

892
00:49:00,843 --> 00:49:02,087
Come on, then.

893
00:49:02,134 --> 00:49:03,627
Come on, Puke, mate.

894
00:49:03,676 --> 00:49:05,466
Sit down.

895
00:49:06,551 --> 00:49:08,293
You what?

896
00:49:08,343 --> 00:49:10,334
Kes, just sit down.

897
00:49:10,384 --> 00:49:14,627
No. No, you can't be serious, mate.
We'll talk about this outside.

898
00:49:14,676 --> 00:49:16,334
Kes, just sit down.

899
00:49:16,384 --> 00:49:18,873
Puke, man, fucking come.
What you on about?

900
00:49:18,926 --> 00:49:20,667
Look, he's fucking right.

901
00:49:21,676 --> 00:49:23,666
What can I do, man? Are you coming?

902
00:49:23,717 --> 00:49:24,498
No.

903
00:49:24,551 --> 00:49:28,129
- Gadge, come on, Tubs, man.
- Fuck off calling me Tubs!

904
00:49:28,175 --> 00:49:29,799
I'm sick of you, Woody.

905
00:49:29,843 --> 00:49:32,876
This is why I'm staying,
because you're always taking the piss,

906
00:49:32,925 --> 00:49:34,916
making me feel that fucking big.

907
00:49:34,967 --> 00:49:36,957
He's put things into perspective.

908
00:49:37,842 --> 00:49:40,923
Look at the other night.
You didn't step up once then.

909
00:49:46,551 --> 00:49:48,043
Join me.

910
00:49:53,508 --> 00:49:56,211
Milky, man,
I know I let you down the other night,

911
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:59,754
but I swear to you
I'll never fucking do it again. Look at me.

912
00:49:59,842 --> 00:50:02,756
I'd never do it again.
I swear to God I wouldn't, man.

913
00:50:04,758 --> 00:50:07,329
You're my bro, man. What the fuck?

914
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:21,162
Come on, mate.

915
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:30,710
Shaun? Come on, man. We're off.

916
00:50:30,757 --> 00:50:32,795
Come on, Shaun.
- No.

917
00:50:32,841 --> 00:50:35,127
Shaun, man, you can't fucking stay here.

918
00:50:35,174 --> 00:50:36,336
Shaun?

919
00:50:37,341 --> 00:50:41,169
He's just a kid. The things you've said
have made him want to stay.

920
00:50:41,216 --> 00:50:43,419
Woody, I wanna make my dad proud.

921
00:50:43,465 --> 00:50:44,923
Listen, love...

922
00:50:44,966 --> 00:50:46,755
See you later, mate.

923
00:50:46,841 --> 00:50:48,831
See you later, Lol, love.

924
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:50,873
He's 12. I can't leave him here.

925
00:50:50,924 --> 00:50:53,329
- Go.
- Nothing we can do if he wants to stay.

926
00:50:53,382 --> 00:50:55,622
You fucking look after him, do you hear me?

927
00:50:55,674 --> 00:50:58,162
He can look after himself.
He's proved that.

928
00:50:58,215 --> 00:50:59,708
See yous later.

929
00:50:59,757 --> 00:51:01,748
Come on, love.

930
00:51:01,799 --> 00:51:03,836
Come on, now.

931
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:12,713
See you later, mate.

932
00:51:16,756 --> 00:51:19,707
Don't forget, you've got a snake
in the grass with you there.

933
00:51:19,756 --> 00:51:21,463
You're a good man.

934
00:51:21,507 --> 00:51:23,497
A brave good man, man.

935
00:51:24,507 --> 00:51:26,213
A really good man.

936
00:51:26,257 --> 00:51:30,085
A cup of tea for the boys there, Banj.
Few Pot Noodles or something.

937
00:51:30,131 --> 00:51:32,880
I'm fucking gagging for a shit, me,
I'm telling you.

938
00:51:51,756 --> 00:51:53,379
Don't worry about it.

939
00:51:54,381 --> 00:51:56,371
I'll have a word with Woody.

940
00:51:56,422 --> 00:51:58,413
I'll sort it, I promise you.

941
00:51:58,464 --> 00:52:00,040
I just feel really bad.

942
00:52:00,089 --> 00:52:02,044
He looked gutted, Combo.

943
00:52:02,089 --> 00:52:04,329
I know, I feel bad, as well, but...

944
00:52:04,381 --> 00:52:06,371
Oh, fucking hell, let's face it.

945
00:52:06,422 --> 00:52:08,413
Woody's not like me and you.

946
00:52:10,297 --> 00:52:13,046
No, he's fucking certainly not like you.

947
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:16,040
No-one's ever fucking took a swing at me
like that.

948
00:52:16,089 --> 00:52:17,830
- Really?
- Honest.

949
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:18,910
Honest.

950
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,670
It's like looking in the mirror.

951
00:52:22,421 --> 00:52:24,957
20 years ago, when I was fucking 12,

952
00:52:25,005 --> 00:52:27,043
taking swings at big men.

953
00:52:27,089 --> 00:52:30,454
I don't know, I just don't like
people speaking about my dad,

954
00:52:30,505 --> 00:52:32,294
even in a nice way.

955
00:52:32,338 --> 00:52:35,041
I don't even like people
speaking about the war.

956
00:52:37,171 --> 00:52:39,162
You loved him, didn't you?

957
00:52:42,088 --> 00:52:43,118
Yeah.

958
00:52:46,088 --> 00:52:47,711
And then you lost him.

959
00:52:51,754 --> 00:52:53,247
Yeah.

960
00:52:55,629 --> 00:52:57,253
I know what it's like.

961
00:52:58,629 --> 00:53:00,620
To have people walk out on you.

962
00:53:00,671 --> 00:53:03,242
To have people just fucking leave you.

963
00:53:05,629 --> 00:53:08,876
Honest, lad, I know how you feel.

964
00:53:10,088 --> 00:53:12,078
If you ever want anyone to talk to...

965
00:53:13,504 --> 00:53:15,293
someone to cry with

966
00:53:15,337 --> 00:53:17,624
or just to fucking have a hug

967
00:53:17,671 --> 00:53:19,661
or punch the fuck out of 'em,

968
00:53:19,712 --> 00:53:21,869
I'm telling you, I'll be there for you.

969
00:53:21,921 --> 00:53:23,912
I won't turn my back on you.

970
00:53:25,087 --> 00:53:26,877
I promise you that.

971
00:53:31,254 --> 00:53:32,284
Spit.

972
00:53:34,462 --> 00:53:36,667
That's a man's handshake, that.

973
00:53:36,712 --> 00:53:38,169
I promise you.

974
00:53:39,087 --> 00:53:41,410
I won't let you down.

- Look at the size of that dog.
- Gadge, have a look at that dog.

994
00:54:50,377 --> 00:54:52,533
Just get on with it.

995
00:54:52,585 --> 00:54:54,955
Excuse me, mate,
is there a toilet here?

996
00:54:55,961 --> 00:54:57,951
Ah, my arse is killing.

997
00:54:59,502 --> 00:55:01,492
- All right, boss?
- Round the back.

998
00:55:01,544 --> 00:55:03,534
- Round the back.
- Cheers, boss.

999
00:55:11,793 --> 00:55:14,791
I am hungry, yeah.
There should be a barbecue or something.

1000
00:55:14,835 --> 00:55:16,458
Buffet food...

1001
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,250
All right, look, yous three,

1002
00:55:19,293 --> 00:55:21,746
yous three, I want yous
on your best behaviour.

1003
00:55:21,793 --> 00:55:23,867
Right? Your fucking best behaviour.

1004
00:55:25,168 --> 00:55:27,159
Ooh, he's got a nice car!

1005
00:55:29,168 --> 00:55:30,625
Nice car.

1006
00:55:31,709 --> 00:55:33,914
Here they are.
Wait there. Hold it back, lads.

1007
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,950
- Just wait there.
- Come on.

1008
00:55:36,001 --> 00:55:38,536
Just wait there.
Behave yourself. Wait there.

1009
00:55:38,584 --> 00:55:40,042
You all right?

1010
00:55:41,501 --> 00:55:43,538
How are you, Arthur? Good to see you.

1011
00:55:43,584 --> 00:55:45,374
All right, Lenny, mate.

1012
00:55:45,417 --> 00:55:47,408
All right? A pleasure. A pleasure.

1013
00:55:47,459 --> 00:55:48,917
All right, mate.

1014
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,366
Gentlemen, there is a forgotten word.

1015
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:54,661
No.

1016
00:55:54,709 --> 00:55:56,451
An almost forbidden word.

1017
00:55:57,459 --> 00:55:59,864
A word that means more to me
than any other.

1018
00:56:00,917 --> 00:56:02,742
That word is "England".

1019
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,166
Yes!

1020
00:56:09,167 --> 00:56:13,871
Once, we flaunted it in the face
of the world, like a banner.

1021
00:56:13,917 --> 00:56:15,908
It was a word that stood for power.

1022
00:56:16,917 --> 00:56:19,204
A word that stood for freedom.

1023
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:21,241
A word that stood for respect.

1024
00:56:22,251 --> 00:56:23,743
But today,

1025
00:56:23,792 --> 00:56:27,239
we're scarcely even allowed
to speak the name of our country.

1026
00:56:27,291 --> 00:56:28,785
Gadge, are you honestly...

1027
00:56:28,834 --> 00:56:32,115
Well, I want to revive that word,
a grand old word,

1028
00:56:32,166 --> 00:56:34,157
the word "Englishman".

1029
00:56:34,208 --> 00:56:35,370
Yes! Yes!

1030
00:56:35,416 --> 00:56:36,411
Yes!

1031
00:56:38,999 --> 00:56:40,990
Now we've been marginalised.

1032
00:56:41,041 --> 00:56:43,032
We've been called "cranks".

1033
00:56:43,083 --> 00:56:44,908
We're not cranks.

1034
00:56:44,958 --> 00:56:47,162
Some people say we're racists.

1035
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:49,448
We're not racists. We're realists.

1036
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,952
Some people call us Nazis.

1037
00:56:51,999 --> 00:56:53,990
We're not Nazis.

1038
00:56:54,041 --> 00:56:57,158
No, what we are, we are nationalists.

1039
00:56:57,208 --> 00:57:00,988
And there's a reason
people try to pigeonhole us like this.

1040
00:57:01,041 --> 00:57:03,909
And that is because of one word, gentlemen.

1041
00:57:03,958 --> 00:57:05,948
- Fear.
Yeah.

1042
00:57:05,999 --> 00:57:07,575
They fear us.

1043
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:11,570
They fear us because we are the true voice
of the people of this country.

1044
00:57:11,624 --> 00:57:13,449
- Yes!
Yes, Lenny.

1045
00:57:13,499 --> 00:57:15,536
People who work hard,

1046
00:57:15,582 --> 00:57:17,240
pay their way,

1047
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:19,993
it don't matter
what their ethnic background is,

1048
00:57:20,041 --> 00:57:22,363
I welcome with open arms in this country.

1049
00:57:22,415 --> 00:57:25,117
It's the people who think
we owe them a living.

1050
00:57:25,165 --> 00:57:28,163
These are the people that need to go back.

1051
00:57:28,207 --> 00:57:29,996
Yes!

1052
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,617
Send them back!

1053
00:57:31,666 --> 00:57:34,201
- Send the bastards back!
- Send them back!

1054
00:57:34,249 --> 00:57:35,623
Send them back!

1055
00:57:35,666 --> 00:57:38,035
An English king on a battlefield once said,

1056
00:57:38,082 --> 00:57:41,910
"From this day till the end of the world,
only we in it shall be remembered,

1057
00:57:41,957 --> 00:57:45,653
we few, we happy few,
we band of brothers."

1058
00:57:45,706 --> 00:57:48,112
Gentlemen, it is the time to stand up
and be counted.

1059
00:57:48,165 --> 00:57:50,736
Yes!
- It is the time for action.

1060
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:53,741
Our country has been stolen
from under our noses.

1061
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:55,330
Yes!

1062
00:57:55,373 --> 00:57:57,826
Well, gentlemen,
it's time to take it back!

1063
00:57:57,873 --> 00:57:59,070
Yes!

1064
00:57:59,123 --> 00:58:01,409
Yes! Go on, Lenny! Go on, Lenny!

1065
00:58:01,456 --> 00:58:03,910
Are you ready to return to the fight?

1066
00:58:03,957 --> 00:58:04,987
Yes!

1067
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,610
- Are you ready to shed blood?
Yes!

1068
00:58:07,665 --> 00:58:10,781
Are you ready to fight for this country
with your last breath of life?

1069
00:58:10,832 --> 00:58:11,992
Yes!

1070
00:58:12,039 --> 00:58:14,243
Lenny! Lenny! Lenny!

1071
00:58:14,289 --> 00:58:15,747
Lenny! Lenny...

1072
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:19,237
Gentlemen, join our band of brothers.
Sign up today.

1073
00:58:19,289 --> 00:58:21,244
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1074
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:22,320
Yes!

1075
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:24,991
I'm going to have a word with Lenny.
Yous wait here.

1076
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:27,575
- Amazing that.
- You're dead right.

1077
00:58:31,289 --> 00:58:33,742
Fucking, Gadge.
- What?

1078
00:58:33,789 --> 00:58:35,779
Do you not feel bad about Woody?

1079
00:58:35,831 --> 00:58:38,497
What do you mean,
do I not feel bad about him? Look.

1080
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:40,571
Look at all these people in here.

1081
00:58:40,622 --> 00:58:42,199
This is right.

1082
00:58:42,248 --> 00:58:44,949
If it wasn't right,
all these wouldn't be here.

1083
00:58:44,997 --> 00:58:47,035
- Think about...
- I'm not saying that.

1084
00:58:47,081 --> 00:58:49,747
Do you not feel bad
about just leaving him like that?

1085
00:58:49,789 --> 00:58:52,241
- He's been our mate for...
- We've not left him.

1086
00:58:52,288 --> 00:58:53,865
I'm still his friend.

1087
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:56,824
Comb...

1088
00:58:56,872 --> 00:59:00,617
You know, you're supposed to have
a qualified driver in the front.

1089
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,577
Are you gonna fucking report me?

1090
00:59:04,622 --> 00:59:06,245
Well, it's illegal.

1091
00:59:08,705 --> 00:59:11,193
We're really squashed in the back here.

1092
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:14,571
Can one of us come up the front?

1093
00:59:22,121 --> 00:59:24,196
Shall we show him?
Shall we show him?

1094
00:59:27,788 --> 00:59:29,410
Don't look, Comb.

1095
00:59:29,454 --> 00:59:31,031
What is it, lad?

1096
00:59:36,663 --> 00:59:38,238
Fuck off!

1097
00:59:38,287 --> 00:59:40,693
That's my fucking boy! Look at that.

1098
00:59:40,746 --> 00:59:44,443
That's why he's in the fucking front,
Meggy, you fucking gobshite.

1099
00:59:44,496 --> 00:59:47,245
- Do you like it?
- It's fucking brilliant, that.

1100
00:59:47,287 --> 00:59:48,697
Fucking brilliant.

1101
00:59:48,788 --> 00:59:51,110
Do you reckon Lenny'll mind
that we nicked it?

1102
00:59:51,162 --> 00:59:55,073
No, will he fuck. That's going in
the middle of the wall, back in the flat.

1103
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:57,111
We'll build all our stuff round that.

1104
00:59:57,162 --> 01:00:00,160
That's gonna be our fucking centrepiece.
That's the focus.

1105
01:00:01,579 --> 01:00:03,570
- Glad you like it.
- Nice one, son.

1106
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:05,575
What's it called, that flag?

1107
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:07,907
St George's Cross, isn't it, Combo?

1108
01:00:07,954 --> 01:00:10,987
Yeah. St fucking George's Cross.

1109
01:00:11,995 --> 01:00:13,986
You all right there, Pukes, lad?

1110
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,611
Yeah, I am. I was thinking, mate.

1111
01:00:17,662 --> 01:00:19,652
You seem a bit quiet, lad.

1112
01:00:20,787 --> 01:00:22,161
Yeah.

1113
01:00:25,453 --> 01:00:27,408
You got a problem, then, or what?

1114
01:00:27,453 --> 01:00:30,202
No, I've just got things on my mind, Combo.

1115
01:00:30,245 --> 01:00:31,702
Like what?

1116
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:35,112
Well, like...

1117
01:00:36,161 --> 01:00:38,152
Well, can I ask you something?

1118
01:00:39,161 --> 01:00:42,159
Do you really believe
in all that shit, Combo?

1119
01:00:46,578 --> 01:00:48,236
Fucking hell, Comb!

1120
01:00:48,286 --> 01:00:50,443
Oi, Gadge, come with me.
He's getting me out.

1121
01:00:50,495 --> 01:00:53,362
Open the fucking door!
Get fucking out now!

1122
01:00:53,411 --> 01:00:56,244
- Get fucking out!
- All right, all right, all right.

1123
01:00:56,286 --> 01:00:58,691
Out of the car.
Get out, you little fucking shitbag.

1124
01:00:58,786 --> 01:00:59,734
You...

1125
01:00:59,786 --> 01:01:01,776
don't you fucking ever...

1126
01:01:01,828 --> 01:01:07,065
fucking ever, ever undermine me again
in front of my fucking troops.

1127
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:09,110
Do you understand me?

1128
01:01:09,161 --> 01:01:11,365
Do you understand me? Eh? Yeah?

1129
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:14,658
Now, fuck off back to Woody,
you little fucking queer.

1130
01:01:14,702 --> 01:01:16,907
Go on, fuck off! Fuck off!

1131
01:01:16,953 --> 01:01:19,275
- You little queer.
- Oi, lads.

1132
01:01:20,285 --> 01:01:22,193
- Oi, Shaun, man, come.
- Leave him alone.

1133
01:01:22,244 --> 01:01:24,234
- Oi, come out.
- Sorry, mate.

1134
01:01:24,285 --> 01:01:26,490
- I can't.
- Fuck off. Leave him alone. Walk!

1135
01:01:26,577 --> 01:01:28,153
What the fuck?

1136
01:01:28,202 --> 01:01:30,276
Waaaah!

1137
01:02:08,493 --> 01:02:12,487
Right, this is where all the fucking Pakis
go to work in the chicken factory.

1138
01:02:12,535 --> 01:02:15,367
- Fucking do it, boys.
- Can we go to the chicken factory?

1139
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:18,364
- Just fucking do it.
- What shall I put?

1140
01:02:18,409 --> 01:02:20,400
Anything. Put anything you want.

1141
01:02:30,909 --> 01:02:32,900
Fucking bastards!

1142
01:02:32,951 --> 01:02:36,779
Don't fucking come back,
you fucking little whore!

1143
01:02:39,575 --> 01:02:41,566
Fuck off.

1144
01:02:43,283 --> 01:02:45,109
Go on. On your own.

1145
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,771
Yeah, fuck off, you Paki bastards!

1146
01:02:47,826 --> 01:02:49,448
- Fuck off.
- Go on, son!

1147
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:51,908
Hey-hey!

1148
01:02:53,617 --> 01:02:56,650
Look at these
little fucking sewer rats. Look.

1149
01:02:57,659 --> 01:02:59,281
Fucking vermin.

1150
01:03:00,367 --> 01:03:01,611
Oi!

1151
01:03:10,158 --> 01:03:14,366
Now, that's our ball now.
Right? And we're playing here.

1152
01:03:14,408 --> 01:03:18,023
So, I suggest you take fucking
Tweedledum and Tweedledee

1153
01:03:18,075 --> 01:03:19,864
and fuck off home.

1154
01:03:20,783 --> 01:03:23,272
If I see you on my streets again...

1155
01:03:25,075 --> 01:03:26,567
I'll slash you.

1156
01:03:28,075 --> 01:03:31,855
And it'll be a hundred times
fucking worse.

1157
01:03:31,908 --> 01:03:33,281
- All right?
- Yeah.

1158
01:03:33,324 --> 01:03:36,239
Now run home,
cos Mummy's cooking curry. Go on.

1159
01:03:36,282 --> 01:03:37,610
Meggy!

1160
01:03:39,991 --> 01:03:41,781
Get in goal, Gadge.

1161
01:04:39,198 --> 01:04:40,774
Have a look in there.

1162
01:04:46,573 --> 01:04:48,149
- Is that for me?
- Yeah.

1163
01:04:49,281 --> 01:04:51,272
We need to fly that with pride.

1164
01:04:57,697 --> 01:04:59,274
See you tonight, Woody.

1165
01:05:20,947 --> 01:05:24,028
Hey, Meggy, how do you spell "off"?
Is it one "f" or two?

1166
01:05:25,155 --> 01:05:26,945
Meggy, one "f" or two?

1167
01:05:35,572 --> 01:05:37,563
Get me... a hundred fags,

1168
01:05:37,613 --> 01:05:41,654
two bottles of wine, a bottle of whisky,
and ten cans of lager now.

1169
01:05:41,696 --> 01:05:43,901
You know what you're gonna have?
Nothing.

1170
01:05:43,947 --> 01:05:44,941
What?

1171
01:05:44,988 --> 01:05:47,476
You know you're not supposed
to be here. Go. Out.

1172
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:49,651
Just fucking get 'em, you Paki bastard!

1173
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,111
What did you say?

1174
01:05:52,155 --> 01:05:55,271
Get them, you filthy Paki bastard.

1175
01:05:56,279 --> 01:05:58,105
Right, that's it.

1176
01:06:00,279 --> 01:06:02,815
Just... Wait till I just...

1177
01:06:03,863 --> 01:06:04,977
Get off!

1178
01:06:05,029 --> 01:06:07,399
- Get out!
- What's going on, mate? Problem?

1179
01:06:07,446 --> 01:06:09,236
He's been calling me a Paki bastard.

1180
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,654
Open the door.

1181
01:06:10,696 --> 01:06:13,231
Get your fucking hands off him now!

1182
01:06:13,279 --> 01:06:15,104
Fucking hands off him!

1183
01:06:15,154 --> 01:06:18,603
Take what you want, kid.
Take the fucking whisky and the ciggies.

1184
01:06:18,655 --> 01:06:20,645
Oi, oi!

1185
01:06:22,071 --> 01:06:24,061
Go on, lads, get the gear.

1186
01:06:24,112 --> 01:06:26,103
Come on. Everything.

1187
01:06:26,154 --> 01:06:28,773
Come on, hurry up, don't fuck about.

1188
01:06:31,363 --> 01:06:33,353
What are you fucking doing?

1189
01:06:33,403 --> 01:06:36,437
- I'm having a shit.
- Oh, for fuck's sake, man!

1190
01:06:36,487 --> 01:06:38,477
- Put your arse away.
You bastard.

1191
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:40,644
Come on, hurry up. Get the stuff, mate.

1192
01:06:40,695 --> 01:06:44,392
For fuck's sake, we need booze
and fags for tonight, lads. Come on.

1193
01:06:44,445 --> 01:06:47,894
Fucking hell, Gadge, could you get
any more fucking sweets, man?

1194
01:06:47,946 --> 01:06:49,224
Fucking hell.

1195
01:06:49,278 --> 01:06:51,565
- Put 'em in the car.
- Come on.

1196
01:06:51,612 --> 01:06:52,856
Paki!

1197
01:06:54,028 --> 01:06:55,735
Yeah, Paki.

1198
01:06:55,779 --> 01:06:58,101
Picking on a kid, mate? Fucking hell.

1199
01:06:58,153 --> 01:07:00,559
Picking on a fucking kid, was you?

1200
01:07:00,612 --> 01:07:02,270
- Eh?
- Take what you want and go.

1201
01:07:02,362 --> 01:07:06,225
Shut up! I'm talking.
I'm your fucking size. Fuck with me.

1202
01:07:06,278 --> 01:07:08,020
You've got what you want. Just go now.

1203
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:09,859
Don't you fucking dare backchat me,

1204
01:07:09,903 --> 01:07:14,193
cos I will slay you now where you fucking
stand, you fucking Paki cunt.

1205
01:07:14,237 --> 01:07:15,350
Right?

1206
01:07:15,403 --> 01:07:17,773
You listen to fucking me!

1207
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:20,734
That fucking kid's dad died
for this fucking country.

1208
01:07:20,778 --> 01:07:22,650
What have you fucking done for it?

1209
01:07:22,694 --> 01:07:25,776
Fuck all, but take fucking jobs
off decent people.

1210
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:28,024
Now, listen, son, listen good.

1211
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:31,850
We'll be back here whenever we want,
right, cos this is fucking ours now.

1212
01:07:31,903 --> 01:07:34,189
This is ours, this, fucking Sandhu.

1213
01:07:34,236 --> 01:07:36,606
Don't forget that. Any fucking time.

1214
01:07:36,653 --> 01:07:39,567
And clean the place up.
It fucking stinks of curry.

1215
01:07:39,611 --> 01:07:41,068
Fucking stinks.

1216
01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:43,434
Reeks of the fucking shit.

1217
01:07:43,486 --> 01:07:45,773
What yous doing, boys?

1218
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:49,398
Get in the fucking car, will you?
Get in the fucking car!

1219
01:07:49,444 --> 01:07:51,234
You've got the fucking keys.

1220
01:07:52,653 --> 01:07:56,100
Get in the fucking car now.
Look at my fucking arse!

1221
01:07:56,152 --> 01:07:58,558
Get in the fucking car. Hurry up!

1222
01:07:59,652 --> 01:08:01,642
This is a very posh area.

1223
01:08:01,693 --> 01:08:04,775
What did you say
her dad did for a living, Gadget?

1224
01:08:04,819 --> 01:08:07,023
- Works on the oil rigs.
- Fucking hell.

1225
01:08:07,069 --> 01:08:10,067
I fancy some posh totty.
Which one is it?

1226
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:12,396
- The one with the balloons.
Here.

1227
01:08:12,443 --> 01:08:13,936
Fucking hell.

1228
01:08:13,985 --> 01:08:15,976
Put the brakes on.

1229
01:08:16,027 --> 01:08:17,603
That'll do us, won't it?

1230
01:08:17,652 --> 01:08:19,642
I can't wait to see Smell.

1231
01:08:19,693 --> 01:08:22,098
- So, Smell, you're finally legal.
- Yeah.

1232
01:08:22,151 --> 01:08:24,142
Not that it ever made a difference.

1233
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:31,809
- Ready? Three...
- Wait, wait.

1234
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:33,850
Come on. Wait there. Are we all here?

1235
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:35,394
Right.

1236
01:08:35,443 --> 01:08:38,560
- Smell, get us a drink.
I've had chronic pains.

1237
01:08:38,610 --> 01:08:40,233
- Strippers!
- Constipation.

1238
01:08:40,276 --> 01:08:42,433
- Someone at the door!
- Stop now, yeah?

1239
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:43,763
Hi, lad.

1240
01:08:43,818 --> 01:08:45,808
- Hello.

1241
01:08:45,859 --> 01:08:47,187

01:09:06,484 --> 01:09:08,558
It was better in the car.

1250
01:09:08,609 --> 01:09:10,232
Woo! Well, I'm gonna get off.

1251
01:09:10,275 --> 01:09:12,349
Past my bedtime and there's a...

1252
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,889
I've got to tape summat on aardvarks.

1253
01:09:14,943 --> 01:09:17,265
- You're not going, are you?
Woody, stay.

1254
01:09:17,317 --> 01:09:19,355
- Are you coming, Milk?
- Yeah, mate.

1255
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,356
Please, Woods, man, don't go.

1256
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,935
Oh, no, it's nothing personal
with you, mate.

1257
01:09:23,983 --> 01:09:25,808
I'm just gonna get off.

1258
01:09:25,858 --> 01:09:28,892
Come on, Wood. Fucking hell,
I've brought booze and everything.

1259
01:09:28,942 --> 01:09:30,399
Can't we bury the hatchet?

1260
01:09:30,442 --> 01:09:33,890
I know what you've come for, man.
I'd rather get off, like.

1261
01:09:33,942 --> 01:09:37,638
It's this thing on aardvarks,
I'm really eager to watch it.

1262
01:09:37,691 --> 01:09:41,057
Come on, then, let's have you.
Come on, let's have you, folks.

1263
01:09:41,108 --> 01:09:43,810
You have a good birthday, you,
all right, lovey?

1264
01:09:43,858 --> 01:09:45,765
Sorry to be missioning it off.

1265
01:09:46,775 --> 01:09:48,315
Nice one, mate.

1266
01:09:48,358 --> 01:09:50,148
You look after yourself, you.

1267
01:09:50,192 --> 01:09:52,183
- Bye, Woody.
- See you, Tubby.

1268
01:09:52,233 --> 01:09:53,560
Bye, Milky.

1269
01:09:53,608 --> 01:09:55,397
- Bye, Pob.
- See you later, folks.

1270
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,977
- Come on, Puke.
- See you later, Puke.

1271
01:09:59,066 --> 01:10:01,389
You're a twat, mate!
You're a fucking w...

1272
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:04,189
See you later. Have a good night.

1273
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:06,686
If only you knew.

1274
01:10:11,816 --> 01:10:13,641
Happy birthday, Smell.

1275
01:10:13,691 --> 01:10:15,647
- Smell!
- What's that?

1276
01:10:15,691 --> 01:10:17,148
Porno?

1277
01:10:17,191 --> 01:10:19,431
What are you giving her porno for,
Meggy?

1278
01:10:19,483 --> 01:10:21,805
She's a woman.
She's got her own nipples.

1279
01:10:21,857 --> 01:10:23,647
I thought she might like it.

1280
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:25,481
Smell, are you ready?

1281
01:10:25,565 --> 01:10:27,142
The er... magicians.

1282
01:10:27,191 --> 01:10:28,648
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

1283
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:31,061
Three... two... one.

1284
01:10:31,107 --> 01:10:33,098
Alakazam! Yeah!

1285
01:10:33,149 --> 01:10:35,140
- Alaka... Alakazam.
- Alakazam.

1286
01:10:35,191 --> 01:10:36,648
Wahey!

1287
01:10:37,857 --> 01:10:39,848
Happy birthday, Smell.

1288
01:10:39,899 --> 01:10:41,475
Happy...

1289
01:10:42,482 --> 01:10:44,519
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

1290
01:10:44,565 --> 01:10:47,647
- Do you want me to put it on the table?
- Yeah, please.

1291
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:51,387
- Here you are. Put that on the table.
- Cheers, love, thanks.

1292
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:54,142
You don't mind us coming, do you, Smell?
It's just...

1293
01:10:54,190 --> 01:10:58,231
My little man, here, wanted to surprise you
on your birthday and all that.

1294
01:10:58,273 --> 01:10:59,849
Happy birthday, Smell.

1295
01:11:05,689 --> 01:11:07,680
Do you think my party's going all right?

1296
01:11:07,773 --> 01:11:09,432
It's been all right, yeah.

1297
01:11:09,482 --> 01:11:11,472
Better if Woody was here.

1298
01:11:11,524 --> 01:11:14,474
Yeah, I know, man.
I don't know why they left.

1299
01:11:14,523 --> 01:11:16,560
They just kind of got up and went.

1300
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:19,604
I don't think Woody was standing
any of it from Combo.

1301
01:11:20,606 --> 01:11:24,351
I mean, I don't know what's going on
with those two,

1302
01:11:24,397 --> 01:11:26,353
but there's some real tension.

1303
01:11:26,397 --> 01:11:29,182
I can sense some real tension
between them.

1304
01:11:29,231 --> 01:11:31,221
Was you happy when you saw me?

1305
01:11:31,272 --> 01:11:32,552
Yeah.

1306
01:11:32,606 --> 01:11:34,762
I liked it when you gave me that cake.

1307
01:11:34,815 --> 01:11:36,604
I thought it was cool.

1308
01:11:36,648 --> 01:11:38,270
Did you make it?

1309
01:11:39,272 --> 01:11:40,267
Yeah.

1310
01:11:41,272 --> 01:11:43,227
- You didn't, did you?
- No.

1311
01:11:43,272 --> 01:11:44,813
I didn't think you did.

1312
01:11:44,855 --> 01:11:47,142
Did you buy it?

1313
01:11:47,189 --> 01:11:49,014
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you bought it.

1314
01:11:50,648 --> 01:11:52,970
But what did you think to the other night?

1315
01:11:54,105 --> 01:11:56,061
Yeah.

1316
01:11:56,105 --> 01:11:59,471
Do you know what I'm on about?
In the shed and stuff.

1317
01:11:59,563 --> 01:12:01,140
Yeah, that was...

1318
01:12:01,189 --> 01:12:02,978
It was all right, yeah.

1319
01:12:03,022 --> 01:12:04,929
Did you not think much to it?

1320
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:06,389
Oh, yeah.

1321
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,270
It was really nice.

1322
01:12:09,355 --> 01:12:12,140
You know when I asked you
to suck my tits and stuff,

1323
01:12:12,772 --> 01:12:15,224
I just thought
that you weren't that into it.

1324
01:12:15,271 --> 01:12:18,887
I only didn't suck your tits
cos I've never done it before.

1325
01:12:18,939 --> 01:12:22,600
I thought you'd seen a pair of tits
in Germany or summat.

1326
01:12:22,647 --> 01:12:24,851
No, I've seen a pair of tits, but...

1327
01:12:24,897 --> 01:12:26,473
I didn't suck 'em.

1328
01:12:26,563 --> 01:12:27,594
Oh.

1329
01:12:29,814 --> 01:12:31,010
Right.

1330
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:35,309
That's why then, isn't it? It's not
cos you didn't want to or anything?

1331
01:12:35,355 --> 01:12:36,811
Yeah, I just...

1332
01:12:36,854 --> 01:12:39,769
Cos I bet you've had
loads of boys doing it and...

1333
01:12:40,729 --> 01:12:43,218
I felt a bit embarrassed
just in case I couldn't do it.

1334
01:12:43,271 --> 01:12:44,266
Yeah.

1335
01:12:44,355 --> 01:12:46,973
Not that many people have done it to me.

1336
01:12:47,021 --> 01:12:49,012
I just thought it'd be nice, like.

1337
01:12:49,063 --> 01:12:51,053
It'd make us feel closer and stuff.

1338
01:12:52,146 --> 01:12:53,603
I was...

1339
01:12:53,646 --> 01:12:55,387
meaning to ask you.

1340
01:12:57,146 --> 01:13:00,558
This might seem a bit daft,
but will you be my girlfriend?

1341
01:13:01,896 --> 01:13:03,554
Honestly?

1342
01:13:06,813 --> 01:13:08,850
Yeah, I'd love to be.

1343
01:13:08,896 --> 01:13:10,602
It'd be really nice.

1344
01:13:10,646 --> 01:13:14,426
Cos I've been thinking about it, as well,
but I didn't think you'd ever ask me.

1345
01:13:14,479 --> 01:13:19,017
I thought it'd just be, like, a one time,
off in the shed or whatever.

1346
01:13:19,062 --> 01:13:20,803
Will you be all right for...

1347
01:13:20,853 --> 01:13:23,389
them lot to know,
if you're not embarrassed?

1348
01:13:24,395 --> 01:13:26,386
Cos I'm not embarrassed.

1349
01:13:26,437 --> 01:13:28,013
I think you're lovely.

1350
01:13:34,395 --> 01:13:38,637
To maintain peace, with freedom
and justice is always expensive.

1351
01:13:38,686 --> 01:13:42,183
It's less expensive than war,
particularly in human life.

1352
01:13:42,229 --> 01:13:46,009
Might there be a time when we talk
to the Argentines again?

1353
01:13:46,062 --> 01:13:48,894
No. Not on sovereignty.

1354
01:13:48,937 --> 01:13:51,769
One thing... the islanders
have made it perfectly clear,

1355
01:13:51,812 --> 01:13:53,517
these islands are British.

1356
01:13:53,561 --> 01:13:56,310
They are the Queen's loyal subjects.

1357
01:13:56,353 --> 01:13:58,343
They wish it to stay that way.

1358
01:13:58,394 --> 01:14:01,595
At least the weather's been on
Mrs Thatcher's side...

1359
01:14:12,144 --> 01:14:14,763
- Lol.
- For fuck's sake.

1360
01:14:14,811 --> 01:14:16,601
Where are you off? Court?

1361
01:14:16,644 --> 01:14:17,841
No. I...

1362
01:14:17,894 --> 01:14:19,849
- What do you want?
- I wanna talk to you.

1363
01:14:19,894 --> 01:14:22,050
- Well, I'm late for work.
- Just two minutes?

1364
01:14:22,102 --> 01:14:24,259
- I haven't got two minutes.
- All right, Lol?

1365
01:14:24,311 --> 01:14:26,100
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1366
01:14:26,144 --> 01:14:27,767
- Hi, Lol.
- Hiya.

1367
01:14:27,811 --> 01:14:29,682
For fu... I'm going to work.

1368
01:14:29,727 --> 01:14:32,760
- Please, Lol. Two minutes.
- What do you wanna talk to me about?

1369
01:14:32,811 --> 01:14:34,516
- Stuff.
- Stuff?

1370
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,843
- You wanna talk to me about stuff?
- I just wanna have a chat with you.

1371
01:14:37,894 --> 01:14:40,180
About the fact you've just
come out of prison?

1372
01:14:40,227 --> 01:14:43,260
You've ruined everything?
You've broken Woody's fucking heart?

1373
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:46,758
You wanna talk to me about stuff?
Well, I can't fucking wait. Let's go.

1374
01:14:46,811 --> 01:14:48,682
I want to talk about other stuff.

1375
01:14:48,727 --> 01:14:52,174
Other stuff? What other stuff
have you possibly got to say to me?

1376
01:14:52,227 --> 01:14:54,383
Could I just have fucking two minutes
with you?

1377
01:14:54,435 --> 01:14:57,469
No, I'm going to work.
I'm not your fucking counsellor, Combo.

1378
01:14:57,519 --> 01:15:00,635
- I'll come back at dinner time, then.
- No, don't come back.

1379
01:15:00,685 --> 01:15:02,593
I'll come to yours later on.

1380
01:15:02,644 --> 01:15:04,966
To mine?
You can have two minutes now.

1381
01:15:05,018 --> 01:15:06,807
You've got two fucking minutes.

1382
01:15:06,851 --> 01:15:08,428
OK. Sound.

1383
01:15:20,726 --> 01:15:23,297
Come on, then. I'm late for work.

1384
01:15:28,226 --> 01:15:30,715
There's something for you
in the glove box.

1385
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:41,510
A box.

1386
01:15:43,518 --> 01:15:45,508
You make this when you was in prison?

1387
01:15:45,559 --> 01:15:46,590
Yeah.

1388
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:50,510
Thanks.

1389
01:15:54,892 --> 01:15:56,266
Lol...

1390
01:15:57,351 --> 01:15:58,346
Erm...

1391
01:16:00,892 --> 01:16:03,594
Since that night that we spent together,

1392
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:05,798
before I went inside...

1393
01:16:06,809 --> 01:16:09,676
I haven't been able to think about
anything else.

1394
01:16:10,892 --> 01:16:12,301
No, I haven't.

1395
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:14,839
I haven't been able
to get you out of my mind, man.

1396
01:16:16,391 --> 01:16:18,382
And, to be honest with you, Lol...

1397
01:16:19,391 --> 01:16:21,216
just thinking of you...

1398
01:16:22,308 --> 01:16:25,057
got me through
them three and a half years inside.

1399
01:16:26,475 --> 01:16:27,884
I mean...

1400
01:16:28,891 --> 01:16:30,882
That was the best night of my life.

1401
01:16:32,891 --> 01:16:34,882
It was the worst night of my life.

1402
01:16:36,891 --> 01:16:38,170
Why?

1403
01:16:38,225 --> 01:16:41,886
I have done nothing but try and forget
about that night, Combo.

1404
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:46,181
It was... It was beautiful.

1405
01:16:46,225 --> 01:16:47,847
No, I was 16.

1406
01:16:47,891 --> 01:16:50,047
I was pissed off my head.

1407
01:16:51,058 --> 01:16:52,883
It wasn't beautiful.

1408
01:16:56,516 --> 01:16:58,009
I love you, Lol.

1409
01:16:59,099 --> 01:17:00,094
What?

1410
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:05,420
I've...

1411
01:17:06,808 --> 01:17:08,597

between three different women.

1572
01:25:56,797 --> 01:26:01,038
One's got two, the other's got two,
and another one's got three kids.

1573
01:26:01,087 --> 01:26:04,169
And he just, like,
left these families and fucked off?

1574
01:26:04,213 --> 01:26:06,748
Nah, he still sees 'em.

1575
01:26:06,796 --> 01:26:09,249
Yeah, to me,
he still spends time with them.

1576
01:26:09,296 --> 01:26:14,083
They're always round at Christmas
and stuff like that. We all get together.

1577
01:26:14,129 --> 01:26:16,416
A big party till late in the morning.

1578
01:26:18,254 --> 01:26:20,245
Yeah, it's... it's nice.

1579
01:26:20,296 --> 01:26:23,080
It is. It's nice having a big family.

1580
01:26:23,129 --> 01:26:24,835
Have you got a mum and dad?

1581
01:26:24,879 --> 01:26:27,248
Cos you haven't talked about
your mum or dad.

1582
01:26:28,337 --> 01:26:30,208
Yeah, I've got a mum and dad.

1583
01:26:30,253 --> 01:26:31,711
Of course, man.

1584
01:26:31,796 --> 01:26:34,580
A good mum and dad.
Yeah, I can't knock 'em at all.

1585
01:26:35,295 --> 01:26:40,035
I was one of them kids where...
my dad was away all the time.

1586
01:26:40,086 --> 01:26:43,203
Sometimes he was away for, like,
a fortnight, working.

1587
01:26:43,253 --> 01:26:44,332
But...

1588
01:26:45,337 --> 01:26:49,496
I never blamed my dad or anything
like that for him being away and working.

1589
01:26:49,545 --> 01:26:50,540
Cos...

1590
01:26:50,587 --> 01:26:53,040
there was always food on that table.

1591
01:26:53,086 --> 01:26:55,492
That's what I respect that man for.

1592
01:26:55,545 --> 01:26:56,919
Always.

1593
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:00,910
Lucky you, aren't you?

1594
01:27:01,003 --> 01:27:02,495
I tell you...

1595
01:27:02,544 --> 01:27:04,535
you know, any, any time...

1596
01:27:05,544 --> 01:27:07,749
you wanna come round
for something to eat,

1597
01:27:07,795 --> 01:27:10,792
you have to come to my grandma's
to get something to eat.

1598
01:27:10,836 --> 01:27:12,542
- Yeah?
- Yeah, man.

1599
01:27:12,586 --> 01:27:15,786
She'll cook some rice.
She'll cook some peas.

1600
01:27:15,836 --> 01:27:18,076
She'll cook some chicken.

1601
01:27:18,128 --> 01:27:20,165
She sounds dead lovely, don't she?

1602
01:27:20,211 --> 01:27:23,624
Serious, man, then you come home
for some ackee and swordfish.

1603
01:27:24,628 --> 01:27:26,417
That'd be nice, wouldn't it?

1604
01:27:26,461 --> 01:27:28,250
Ah, seriously, man, cos...

1605
01:27:28,294 --> 01:27:33,165
I'd love for you to do that. I'd love
for you to do that. That'd be nice.

1606
01:27:33,211 --> 01:27:37,667
Serious, come and see how we...
how we live. Know what I mean?

1607
01:27:37,711 --> 01:27:40,377
Even on a bad day,
there'll probably be...

1608
01:27:40,419 --> 01:27:42,741
a couple of my uncles
and about seven...

1609
01:27:42,794 --> 01:27:45,365
Fucking hell.
You've got everything, haven't you?

1610
01:27:45,419 --> 01:27:47,244
- What?
- You've got the whole lot.

1611
01:27:48,294 --> 01:27:50,533
You've got the whole fucking
perfect package.

1612
01:27:51,877 --> 01:27:53,251
Fucking hell.

1613
01:27:55,085 --> 01:27:56,827
Got everything, you, didn't you?

1614
01:27:58,835 --> 01:28:01,241
Fucking hell, man. So...

1615
01:28:02,585 --> 01:28:05,536
What... What do you think
makes a bad dad?

1616
01:28:08,126 --> 01:28:10,876
I don't know, mate. I'm not a dad, am I?

1617
01:28:12,668 --> 01:28:14,659
I know you had a good dad, like, but,

1618
01:28:14,710 --> 01:28:19,082
be honest with me, what do you really think
makes a bad dad, though?

1619
01:28:19,126 --> 01:28:20,998
I don't know, man.

1620
01:28:21,043 --> 01:28:23,033
What's with the questions, man?

1621
01:28:23,084 --> 01:28:25,408
I feel like I'm being interrogated.

1622
01:28:28,709 --> 01:28:30,830
What do you reckon?

1623
01:28:31,834 --> 01:28:32,829
Niggers.

1624
01:28:35,667 --> 01:28:38,665
- What's with the "nigger"?
- Because you are, aren't you?

1625
01:28:38,709 --> 01:28:41,198
You're a fucking nigger. Aren't you?

1626
01:28:44,417 --> 01:28:45,697
Aren't you?

1627
01:28:47,043 --> 01:28:48,998
Fucking coon.

1628
01:28:49,043 --> 01:28:51,365
Combo! Just leave him.

1629
01:28:54,876 --> 01:28:56,249
Go on.

1630
01:28:58,876 --> 01:29:00,867
Don't fucking smile at me.

1631
01:29:00,918 --> 01:29:02,540
Don't smile at me.

1632
01:29:02,584 --> 01:29:04,539
Milky, just stop smiling at him, please.

1633
01:29:04,584 --> 01:29:08,992
Don't fucking smile at me, cos I'll wipe
the fucking smile off your fucking face.

1634
01:29:09,042 --> 01:29:10,749
Yeah? You fucking cunt!

1635
01:29:11,334 --> 01:29:13,786
No!
- Fucking horrible...

1636
01:29:13,833 --> 01:29:16,583
Fucking bastard!

1637
01:29:18,459 --> 01:29:21,029
I fucking hate you! I fucking hate you!

1638
01:29:21,083 --> 01:29:23,288
- I fucking hate you!
Get off!

1639
01:29:23,334 --> 01:29:24,826
Milky!

1640
01:29:24,875 --> 01:29:27,493
- No, Combo, get off him!
- You fucking black bastard!

1641
01:29:28,583 --> 01:29:30,657
I fucking hate you! I fucking hate you.

1642
01:29:30,708 --> 01:29:32,912
I fucking hate you! You fucking nigger!

1643
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,457
- You fucking nigger!
- Milky!

1644
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:37,248
Fuck off! Fuck off!

1645
01:29:37,291 --> 01:29:39,661
Combo!

1646
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:40,656
Milky!

1647
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:42,829
Milky, man, are you all right?

1648
01:29:42,875 --> 01:29:44,153
Shut up!

1649
01:29:44,208 --> 01:29:46,827
Shut the fuck up
and get the fuck out now!

1650
01:29:46,875 --> 01:29:48,664
You little fucking cunt.

1651
01:29:48,708 --> 01:29:51,113
Fuck off, you little bastard!

1652
01:29:51,208 --> 01:29:54,159
- I thought you was winding us up.
- What are you doing, boys?

1653
01:29:54,208 --> 01:29:57,621
Fucking all day
we've sat and listened to him.

1654
01:29:57,666 --> 01:29:59,372
I want some of this. We want our bit.

1655
01:29:59,416 --> 01:30:00,825
This man?

1656
01:30:00,874 --> 01:30:02,865
- Aargh!
- You fucking mad cunt!

1657
01:30:02,916 --> 01:30:05,783
You knobhead!
You fucking horrible fucking cunt!

1658
01:30:05,832 --> 01:30:08,700
You're fucking mad as a March hare.
What's wrong with you?

1659
01:30:08,791 --> 01:30:10,615
Fucking leave them alone!

1660
01:30:10,665 --> 01:30:13,333
- Do you want it, as well?
- You're fucking potty.

1661
01:30:13,374 --> 01:30:15,660
What? Fuck off, you fucking dickhead!

1662
01:30:15,707 --> 01:30:18,990
I'll fucking throttle you,
you fucking fat piece of shit!

1663
01:30:19,041 --> 01:30:22,536
Get the fuck out of here,
you fucking goggle-eyed twat!

1664
01:30:23,707 --> 01:30:25,532
Get out. Get out.

1665
01:30:25,582 --> 01:30:28,284
- You need to fucking see someone.
- Get out.

1666
01:30:28,332 --> 01:30:30,322
I said, get out. I said, get out.

1667
01:30:30,373 --> 01:30:31,368
Milky...

1668
01:30:31,415 --> 01:30:34,828
Leave them alone, will you?
They haven't done nothing to you.

1669
01:30:34,874 --> 01:30:36,829
Fucking leave them two alone.

1670
01:30:36,874 --> 01:30:38,366
Leave them alone.

1671
01:30:38,415 --> 01:30:40,986
They've done...
They've done nothing to you.

1672
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:42,450
You fuck...

1673
01:30:44,207 --> 01:30:45,154
Ah!

1674
01:30:46,873 --> 01:30:48,663
No-o-o!

1675
01:30:55,748 --> 01:30:57,371
Fucking hell.

1676
01:30:57,415 --> 01:30:58,872
I'm sorry.

1677
01:30:58,915 --> 01:31:00,905
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1678
01:31:01,623 --> 01:31:03,365
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1679
01:31:06,498 --> 01:31:08,987
Oh, Combo,
what have you done to him?

1680
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,829
Oh, my God!

1681
01:31:10,873 --> 01:31:12,449
No, no, no!

1682
01:31:15,623 --> 01:31:16,617
Milky?

1683
01:31:16,664 --> 01:31:18,240
Wake up, Milky!

1684
01:31:18,289 --> 01:31:19,747
He's OK.

1685
01:31:19,790 --> 01:31:21,531
Milky, wake up!

1686
01:31:21,581 --> 01:31:23,986
Hey, what am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

1687
01:31:25,372 --> 01:31:27,696
It's not my fault. I didn't mean it.

1688
01:31:28,706 --> 01:31:30,780
I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it.

1689
01:31:31,706 --> 01:31:33,826
- Milky, wake up!
- Help me get him...

1690
01:31:33,872 --> 01:31:36,028
- Wake up!
- Help me get him to hospital.

1691
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:38,652
- Help me get him to hospital.
- Get off! Milky!

1692
01:31:38,705 --> 01:31:40,743
Come on, now. Stop it, now.

1693
01:31:40,789 --> 01:31:43,989
Stop the crying.
The crying stops now. You don't cry.

1694
01:31:44,039 --> 01:31:45,828
Real men don't cry.

1695
01:31:45,872 --> 01:31:48,242
Help me get him to the hospital, OK?

1696
01:31:48,289 --> 01:31:49,865
Come on. Let's go.

1697
01:31:49,914 --> 01:31:51,951
Come on, Shaun. Come on. Let's go.

1698
01:31:51,997 --> 01:31:53,573
Come on. Come on.

1699
01:32:07,371 --> 01:32:09,362
OK. Come on. Come on.

1700
01:32:09,413 --> 01:32:11,404
Help me. Help me. Stop crying!

1701
01:32:11,455 --> 01:32:13,196
Don't look at his face.

1702
01:32:13,246 --> 01:32:15,818
Don't look at his face.
Don't look at his face.

1703
01:32:15,872 --> 01:32:17,661
Don't look at his face.

1704
01:34:41,368 --> 01:34:42,399
Shaun?

1705
01:34:45,035 --> 01:34:46,576
Can I come in?

1706
01:34:47,701 --> 01:34:48,898
Yeah.

1707
01:35:01,659 --> 01:35:03,650
It's my favourite picture of Dad.

1708
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:07,777
Me too.

1709
01:35:12,118 --> 01:35:13,610
And that one.

1710
01:35:14,868 --> 01:35:16,823
Mm, yeah, that's really nice.

1711
01:35:16,868 --> 01:35:18,989
You really look alike on that one.

1712
01:35:25,242 --> 01:35:27,991
Do you remember where we were
in that one?

1713
01:35:32,201 --> 01:35:33,231
Where?

1714
01:35:33,284 --> 01:35:34,528
Goy Farms.

1715
01:35:35,534 --> 01:35:37,903
That was like the best holiday ever.

1716
01:35:53,784 --> 01:35:56,354
Milky's gonna be all right, Shaun,
I promise.

1717
01:36:04,784 --> 01:36:06,573
Shaun, are you OK?

1718
01:36:19,408 --> 01:36:20,688
Yeah.

1719
01:36:26,824 --> 01:36:29,858
