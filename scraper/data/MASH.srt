1
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,688
-Radar!
-Yes, sir.

2
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,648
-Get a hold of Major Burns.
-l guess l better call Major Burns.

3
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,066
-Tell him we have to hold...
-Tell him to put another

4
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,734
-day surgeon on night shift.
-...a couple of surgeons

5
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:14,861
over from the day shift
onto the night shift.

6
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,028
l'll put in a call to
General Hammond in Seoul.

7
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,196
Get General Hammond in Seoul,

8
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:18,531
tell him we gotta have
two new surgeons right away.

9
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,657
l hope he sends us
those two new surgeons.

10
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:20,867
We're sure gonna need them.

11
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,536
-What was that, sir?
-l gave everything to Radar.

12
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,745
What?

13
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,620
-What the hell do you think you're doing?
-What? l'm just...

14
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,414
Just because you're captain,
don't think you run the joint.

15
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,416
-Come on...
-l run it.

16
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,169
-Yeah, all right. l'm just supposed to...
-l know what you're supposed to do.

17
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:59,256
Your driver will be with you shortly.
He's having his coffee now.

18
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,555
Racist.

19
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:11,477
Attention. The following men,
report to the departure area.

20
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:15,648
Carey, Michael S, Phelps, Robert A,

21
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:20,528
Colbert T, Cleaver, Herschell B,

22
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,613
Roosevelt, Charles B...

23
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,156
-Goodbye, ladies. Thank you.
-Bye-bye.

24
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,575
-So long.
-Roosevelt B,

25
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,539
Govowska, Theodore G, Miller...

26
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:35,084
-4077th MASH?
-This is the jeep, yeah.

27
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,378
All right.

28
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,424
Okay, let's go, boy.

29
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,511
Get my other bag.

30
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,390
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

31
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,125
Schermerhorn! Get that son of a bitch!
He just stole my jeep.

32
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,296
Hey! Watch what the hell you're doing,
will you?

33
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:32,141
-What the hell...
-What do you mean, it wasn't...

34
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:15,226
-Where is she?
-l couldn't stand it...

35
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,437
-Not another. Another...
-...for my period...

36
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:21,065
There you are, sir. The officers' mess.

37
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,651
Perhaps you would like
to take a small repas.

38
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,655
l don't think l could eat after that ride
you gave me. You want any of this?

39
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,116
No, thank you, sir,
but l could do with my lunch.

40
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,744
Well, why don't you come on in with me
and get a sandwich?

41
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:36,038
l'll follow you anywhere, sir.

42
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,133
How about that piece of scenery,
Yankee, huh?

43
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,467
Yes, sir.

44
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,679
Really a drag.

45
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,360
-No. No.
-When they cut it out, she looked fabulous.

46
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,155
Who are those men?
Friends of yours, Murrhardt?

47
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:13,325
-No, sir. First time l've ever seen them.
-Well, maybe those are the replacements.

48
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,204
Don't be silly. We're expecting
some really sharp surgeons.

49
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,707
Well, l guess
they just got separated from their unit

50
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,209
and are looking for something to eat.

51
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:26,088
They've got a hell of a nerve.
Coming in here, eating our food.

52
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:33,804
Pardon me, can l ask you
to move overjust a little bit? Thank you.

53
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,347
-Be careful with that.
-Yeah.

54
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,683
-But, you know, she's got to use...
-l think l'm in love.

55
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:41,478
...that Phisohex soap on her face.
She really needs something drying.

56
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,355
-She really has a bad complexion.
-Acne, it really is.

57
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,817
-But she's got a bad complexion...
-She won't use soap.

58
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:50,863
Well, you see, the truth is, Lieutenant,
l don't have anything to do tonight.

59
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:55,075
l just got into town and, well,

60
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,785
l thought maybe
you could show me around.

61
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,121
Captain, l think if you'll notice
the lieutenant's beautiful hand,

62
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,707
she is definitely married.

63
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,878
Well, l'm the commanding officer,
and l'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

64
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,006
Boy, Bandini, they're eating here
because they wanted to.

65
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,884
Captain Murrhardt,
please report to the commander's...

66
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,427
The office of the commanding officer...

67
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:17,932
-You men just passing through?
-l was just enjoying that lovely dish there.

68
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:22,353
Captain, you are speaking about
a lieutenant in the United States Army.

69
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,563
l'm Colonel Blake.

70
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,859
Colonel, l'm Duke Forrest, your new cutter.

71
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:32,321
-That's my driver over here.
-Captain Hawkeye Pierce.

72
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,573
-Are you leaving?
-Yes, l am.

73
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:37,243
-Good afternoon, Lieutenant Dish.
-Good afternoon, Captain Hawkeye.

74
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,912
Captain Hawkeye Pierce,
l had a TWX about you.

75
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,456
lt seems that you stole a jeep
up at headquarters.

76
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,377
No, no, no, sir. No, l didn't steal a jeep.
No, it's right outside. Right there.

77
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,711
So it is.

78
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:50,965
Captain Forrest, don't you know that
when you report to your new duty station,

79
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,884
you go to your commanding officer
with a copy of your orders?

80
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,637
Captain Pierce, is it?

81
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,306
Captain Pierce and me
have been boozing all day...

82
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:02,142
Good. Good.
You've been working close to the front.

83
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,852
Now we have our slack periods here,

84
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,814
but when the action starts,
you'll get more work in 1 2 hours...

85
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,691
How many nurses
do we have on the base, sir?

86
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,776
-1 7.
-How many nurses will there be on my...

87
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,778
-Four, then a civilian surgeon.
-...young girl here...

88
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:13,904
-A dozen a month.
-l'd like her as my nurse.

89
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,698
-Yes, l think that could be arranged.
-l could use her.

90
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,449
And the young girl, over here, the blonde.

91
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:21,829
Father Mulcahy, l'd like you to meet
Captain Pierce, our new surgeon.

92
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,790
This is the Catholic chaplain.
And here's Captain Forrest.

93
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,375
-Dago Red.
-Dago Red!

94
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,545
-Captain Waldowski, our dental officer.
-l'm better known as Painless Pole.

95
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,213
This is Captain Black,
our anesthesiologist.

96
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,132

97
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,302

-Duke? Welcome.

98
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,470
-Captain Bandini, here.
-Thank you.

99
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,973
-John Black. How are you?
-l'm proud of that man.

100
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:45,311
-lf you boys have any problems, my tent...
-Bandini, here. Duke, glad to meet you.

101
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:48,397
l was saying if you boys
have any problems, my tent is right...

102
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,232
Radar! O'Reilly.

103
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,401
Gentlemen, l'm Corporal O'Reilly.
They call me Radar.

104
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,320
-You'll be staying in Major Burns' tent.
-Major Burns' tent.

105
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,530
-l'll take your things over there now.
-Everything out of the jeep.

106
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,324
Don't worry about the jeep,
l'll change the numbers.

107
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,117
And change the numbers on that jeep.

108
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,838
Corporal O'Reilly,
you're not billeting these enlisted men

109
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,548
in the officers' area, now, are you?

110
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,846
Excuse me.

111
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:22,890
l'm collecting for my blind brother

112
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,726
-who can't afford the trip to Korea.
-Don't you trust that man. He's a mad dog.

113
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,728
-He'll do anything.
-Unhand me, sir.

114
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,439
Hey, Duke Forrest.

115
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,201
Now, that one's mine.

116
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,751
-Hi, fellas.
-Who? That one?

117
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:52,503
-Yeah.
-Who told you that?

118
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:57,216
-How do you know that?
-"Yea, though l walk through the valley

119
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,427
"of the shadow of death,

120
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:04,681
"l will fear no evil, for thoo art with me."

121
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,809
Thou. "Thou art with me."

122
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,936
-Jesus Christ.
-What's all that about?

123
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,189
That's Major Burns, sir. Excuse me.

124
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,194
-New personnel, Major.
-Good.

125
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,823
-Hiya. Hawkeye Pierce.
-How do you do?

126
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,908
-Duke Forrest.
-Frank Burns.

127
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,619
-How are you?
-Go ahead, Ho-Jon.

128
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,374
"My cup runneth over.

129
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,754
"Surely goodness and mercy

130
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,216
-"shall follow..."
-What's this here?

131
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,260
This is Ho-Jon.
He's one of our mess-hall boys.

132
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,761
l'm teaching him how to read.

133
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:47,474
ls that right?
Reading the Bible, huh? That's nice.

134
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:51,478
Listen, l'll tell you what. l got a book here.
lt's got a lot of pictures in it,

135
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:54,523
and l think it's easier to learn how to read
when you look at pictures.

136
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,859
A little adventure in pictures.

137
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,570
-May l leave now, Major?
-Sure, Ho-Jon.

138
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,655
You have fun, you hear?

139
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,704
There it is. Suture, Mary.

140
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,833
What kind of sutures are these?

141
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,003
-l can't see what the hell l'm doing.
-Storch, l need some more sponge clamps.

142
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,546
-Give me...
-Okay. Just a minute, Les.

143
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,215
-Okay.
-Give me some big hunks of sponge

144
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,509
or something, for crying out loud,
and get that thing right in there.

145
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:23,677
Also some big sponges.
You'll have to use these.

146
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,971
That's bleeding. That's gotta come out.

147
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,056
l can't stop that bleeding down there.

148
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,854
-What's so funny?
-Nothing, sir. Not a thing.

149
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:37,691
-ls that true what l hear about you?
-Duke, back to the kidney. Come on.

150
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,485
-Yeah.
-He's cute.

151
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,112
Give me a clamp. Give me a clamp.

152
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,658
-Here we go.
-Captain Pierce, did you call me?

153
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,328
No, l didn't, and my name's Hawkeye.
Give me the saw.

154
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:52,664
l can't really see.
lt's like the Mississippi River down there.

155
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,791
-Give me another one.
-Doesn't feel like it's in one piece,

156
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,169
l'll tell you that.
l think it's gotta come out of there.

157
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,087
Get in. Get in there.

158
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,925
And give me some more
of that gauze wrapped up there.

159
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,220
Here. lt won't stick otherwise.

160
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,766
Big, honey. lt's... You know, this thing...

161
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:13,185
-You ready?
-l'm ready.

162
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,980
-Nurse, you got a clamp, please?
-Yes, sir.

163
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,819
Scratch my nose. Just there.

164
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,614
There. A little harder, please.

165
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,116
Attention. Attention.

166
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:32,412
All non-commissioned...
Attention. Attention.

167
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:37,209
All non-commissioned officers will report
for short-arm inspection at 0400.

168
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:38,919
That is all.

169
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,925
-What's that?
-That's a martini, Frank.

170
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,719
Finest kind.
We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender.

171
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:51,223
-Would you care to imbibe, sir?
-l don't drink.

172
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,850
Jesus Christ, l think he means it.

173
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:56,895
-l think we've been had, Hawkeye.
-l think you're right, babe.

174
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,732
l don't think it's right to involve a boy
who's not 1 7 years old yet.

175
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,901
-You go to sleep now?
-Yeah.

176
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,903
-l go wash clothes.
-Okay.

177
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:09,408
Hey, you make a mean martini there,
Ho-Jon. You keep it up, you hear?

178
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,253
"Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

179
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,756
"Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven..."

180
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,593
You ever catch this syndrome before,
babe?

181
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:31,388
No, not with anyone beyond the age
of eight years old, l haven't.

182
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,933
"And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

183
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:39,771
"For thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen."

184
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,482
-Amen.
-Amen.

185
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,612
And dear God, protect
our young men on the field of battle,

186
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,323
that they may return home
to their dear ones.

187
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:52,993
And dear God, protect
our supreme commander on the field

188
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,954
and our commander-in-chief
in Washington DC.

189
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,541
Frank, were you on this religious kick
at home or did you crack up over here?

190
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,461
Frank, how long does this show go on?

191
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,130
lt gets longer all the time.

192
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,634
Now l have your soul to pray for
and Captain Pierce's.

193
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:12,763
Onward, Christian soldiers

194
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:16,350
-Marching as to war

-Going on before
-Going on before

205
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,186
-Yeah?
-What's the line-up?

206
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,980
Four waiting for surgery,
two waiting for the lV,

207
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,525
and two waiting for the antibiotics
to take over.

208
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:10,654
We can probably handle that
if there's no more choppers. Pickup.

209
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,199
Scissors.

210
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:17,869
-Hi, ladies.
-Now, wait a second.

211
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,622
-You can't go in the colonel's office.
-That's who we're looking for, Dave.

212
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,207
Henry, you gotta do something.

213
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,751
We have stuck it out
for a whole week now. Pretty girl.

214
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:27,087
Yeah, she kind of grows on you.

215
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,548
-What is it, men?
-That sky pilot.

216
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:32,217
You have got to get him out of our tent.

217
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,344
-Your tent?
-Yeah. Get that nurse in there.

218
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:37,264
She doesn't look like the kind who'd
keep you awake all night praying.

219
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:38,765
l've been in the army a long time.

220
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:42,728
l know what you guys are trying to pull,
but you're not gonna push me around.

221
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,938
Henry, not for the world
would l push you around,

222
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,315
but, look, there is one more thing,
now that you're talking about it.

223
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,400
We need a chest cutter.

224
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,652
Yeah. We gotta get an A-one chest cutter
in here quick, Henry,

225
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,112
or we're gonna be in
a hell of a lot of trouble.

226
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,322
Forget it.
No MASH unit has a chest surgeon.

227
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,699
We're not about to get one.

228
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:56,825
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yeah?

229
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,202
They're behind in the OR,
and the pre-op ward is all jammed up.

230
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,289
The helicopters and the ambulances
are coming in full.

231
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,666
You guys are gonna have to go to work
early today.

232
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,127
And add overtime to a 12-hour day?
What the hell is that?

233
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,212
The union'll raise all kinds of Cain
with you, Henry.

234
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:11,965
Boy, Henry, you work those kind of hours,
you sure need your rest.

235
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,384
And you can't get them with
a sky pilot jabbering to heaven all day.

236
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:16,595
Major Burns will be out of your tent
in 24 hours.

237
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,347
Tell him Captain Pierce
and Captain Forrest are on the way.

238
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,433
Henry, there's just one more thing.

239
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,436
I told you Major Burns will be out
of your tent in 24 hours.

240
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,104
-The chest cutter.
-No.

241
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,150
I'll try, damn it.
You can't ask any more than that.

242
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,745
Pull that back. Put your little finger in.

243
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,335
My abdominal operation was doing fine.
lt's the head wound that did him in.

244
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,295
Dish, get over here and hold this retractor.

245
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,880
-Okay.
-No. No, no...

246
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,715
Dish, let me have a long needle holder.

247
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,885
Go ahead.

248
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:04,226
-Dago!
-Amen.

249
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,603
-Pull it back, Duke.
-Hell, l can't...

250
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,980
-Get hold of the other one.
-Dago.

251
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:12,400
Dago, l want you over here
to hold this retractor. Now.

252
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,028
-Please, come on. Now.
-Yes, l'm sorry.

253
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,488
-Hi, Dago.
-Hey, hold on.

254
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,031
-My hand...
-Don't wiggle it. Just hold on.

255
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,282
Clamp.

256
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,328
l'm sorry, Dago, but this man's still alive,

257
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,705
and that other man is dead,
and that's a fact.

258
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:29,417
Can you hold it with two fingers, Dago?
Hell. Where the hell... Did you see it?

259
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,218
-Sergeant, you know where Hawkeye is?
-You mean Captain Pierce?

260
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:42,097
-No, l'd have to look at the duty roster.
-They're in there.

261
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,808
Oh, baby.

262
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,686
Hawkeye, you gotta remember
l'm married.

263
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,188
l'm married. l'm happy. l love my wife.
lf she was here,

264
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:52,190
-l would be with her.
-l am, too. l'm very happily married.

265
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:55,777
There is no question of loving anybody.
lt is a question only of helping...

266
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:59,155
You see, l made a vow to myself
that while l was gone,

267
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:03,118
l was gonna be faithful to my husband.

268
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,998
Those are the vows you make
when you're with somebody.

269
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,625
Hawkeye?

270
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,964
-Ho-Jon?
-Duke say you better haul ass home quick.

271
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,800
-We got a new chest cutter in our tent.
-Okay.

272
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:27,058
This is Radio Tokyo bringing you
musical interlude for your enjoyment.

273
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:09,809
-That's him.
-Hiya. l'm Hawkeye Pierce.

274
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:15,106
Yeah. See? So all l can get out of him
is he's from Boston,

275
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,400
and he's been in the army two months.

276
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,861
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. And that's all.

277
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:39,547
Well, listen, where were you
when you were drafted?

278
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,926
l was just curious.

279
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:48,264
Back home. l told you before.

280
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,641
No, l mean, what were you doing?

281
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:53,395
Were you like a resident
or on staff some place?

282
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,190
Where?

283
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,567
Hospital.

284
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:01,945
Which hospital?

285
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:03,989
Back home.

286
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:06,908
ls there some reason
l shouldn't know which hospital?

287
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,160
l don't know. l will ask.

288
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:13,623
ls there some reason my friend
should not know the name of the hospital?

289
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:19,546
There doesn't appear to be any reason.
l've seen you somewhere before.

290
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:23,466
l don't know your name, stranger,
but your face is familiar.

291
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:26,052
Have you always had that moustache?

292
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:32,225
Are you a beer drinker, sir, or would
you like to share a martini with me?

293
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,894
Martini, that would be... l'd love a martini.

294
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,814
Ho-Jon, give the gentleman a martini.

295
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:41,693
l think you will find these accommodating.
They're quite dry.

296
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:46,156
Don't you use olives?

297
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,366
Olives? Where the hell
do you think you are, man?

298
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:50,744
We do have to make
certain concessions to the war.

299
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,412
We're three miles from the frontline and...

300
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:55,707
Yes, but a man can't really
savor his martini

301
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,834
without an olive, you know.

302
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,503
Otherwise, you see, it just

303
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:05,341
doesn't quite make it.

304
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:11,765
Attention. The Evangelical United
Brethren Church has donated 34 hymnals

305
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:14,309
to the 4077th MASH unit.

306
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:18,229
These hymnals are located
in the camp library

307
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,732
and may be checked out
by those with cards.

308
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,192
That is all.

309
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:26,613
Listen, am l going to get paid
for giving you guys lessons? Rib cutter.

310
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,951
Small bones, huh?

311
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:37,165
-l need a retractor also, nurse.
-Let's get her, baby.

312
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,709
What do you think? Can l tie this for you?

313
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:44,923
-You need some suction?
-Yeah, that's fine.

314
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,509
Here, pickups for me, please.

315
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:52,055
-How's he doing, John?
-He's doing well.

316
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:54,933
-You're doing a live suture.
-Yeah, looks like that's it.

317
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,810
Looks like that's it.

318
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,772
What the hell did you do with our thread?
lt ran out.

319
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,608
-More thread, please, and larger needles.
-Will you let me?

320
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:07,529
-Let me have another suture.
-You surgeons are all alike, l tell you that.

321
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:12,534
lf this guy knew the clowns who are
operating on him, l think he'd faint.

322
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,786
-l think he has!
-Come on, nurse. l need a suture, please.

323
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,038
-Coming.
-Keep ahead of him, babe, will you?

324
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:19,290
And we need a couple
more stitches in there.

325
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,543
That's fine, yeah. Thank you.

326
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:22,794
Just turn it around.

327
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:26,047
lt's a good thing you have a nice body,
nurse, otherwise we'd get rid of you quick.

328
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:28,383
-Don't stick me.
-Keep it clean.

329
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,467
Come...

330
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,428
-You know, l can tie that for you.
-Yeah.

331
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:35,098
Okay, let's have the big stitches
for holding up the chest.

332
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,432
Fine.

333
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:39,102
-Larger needles, Knocko.
-Now sutures.

334
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,731
Start wrapping up.
l could use another one.

335
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:47,068
Does anybody know if this is
an officer or an enlisted man?

336
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:49,571
-He's an enlisted man.
-Make the stitches big.

337
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:53,616
Attention.
Captain Bani... Captain Bandini.

338
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:57,620
Attention. Attention.
Captain Bandini is now performing

339
00:24:57,705 --> 00:25:01,332
a palmaral pop, poplit, a pop...

340
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:05,128
A palmaral p-o-p-l-i-t-e-r-a-l

341
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:08,548
artery exploration

342
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,383
and possible graft.

343
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:15,889
The following memo
has just come through.

344
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:20,852
Please remove all pictures, postcards,
nude calendars, et cetera, from the walls

345
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:24,189
so that our rooms may look
clean and orderly. That is all.

346
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:26,191
-lt is you. lt's you!
-What?

347
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,526
Duke, l ever tell you
how Androscoggin College

348
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:30,737
beat Dartmouth in a raging blizzard 6-0

349
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:32,697
-'cause l intercepted a pass?
-Yeah. You told me.

350
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,699
They had this great passer, see,

351
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,868
and we held them 0-0
till the last 20 seconds,

352
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:40,705
and then, snow and all, he let one go,
and it went sailing, boom!

353
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,208
Lucky your mouth wasn't open
or it would've gotten stuck in your throat.

354
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,710
Oh, baby! How is Trapper John?

355
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,296
-l thought you'd never remember!
-John Mclntyre!

356
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,674
John Mclntyre! Trapper John.

357
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,553
Only man ever found fulfillment in
a Boston Maine Railway, in the ladies' can.

358
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:58,514
Conductor opened the door, the girl
looked out and yelled, "He trapped me!

359
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,767
"Oh, my God, he trapped me!"
Honest to God. How are you?

360
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:03,561
l'm great. What's going on over there?

361
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:07,732
Well, well, well, must be
Painless Polish Day in the shower tent.

362
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,567
Painless Polish Day in the shower tent?

363
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:11,653
Walt Waldowski, the dentist. You met him.

364
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,404
Well, what, are those guys waiting
to scrub his back?

365
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:17,659
No. He's what you might call
the best-equipped dentist in the army.

366
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,577
-You may call it that.
-Yeah.

367
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,457
l saw once in med school, in pre-med.

368
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,752
l did an autopsy on a guy. He would have
been drowned and all swollen up...

369
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,587
-You an authority on that?
-l heard that one, too.

370
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:31,464
-The most extraordinary thing.
-You told that one...

371
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,549
And a friend of mine had a...

372
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:36,552
Boy, l'd surely love to see that angry!

373
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,251
Nurse!

374
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:56,424
Boone, get me a cc of adrenaline
and a cardiac needle.

375
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:59,761
-l'm sorry...
-Just get it!

376
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,147
And you can cut me about
a four-inch piece of wire

377
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,149
and about an inch and a half of tape.

378
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:19,947
-Hi, soldier.
-Who is it?

379
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:23,534
lt's Trapper, Trapper. Don't worry.
Let's get some of this stuff off.

380
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:26,621
You idiot! l said a cardiac needle.

381
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:31,250
-You want me to get a nurse?
-lt's too late, Boone. You killed him.

382
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,744
At ease. This is Major O'Houlihan,
our new chief nurse.

383
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:08,746
This is where we do the dirty work.

384
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:10,957
-Captain Murrhardt.
-Sponge.

385
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,625
-Hi.
-Hi, Captain.

386
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:17,338
Dennis, don't you remember? l helped
carry your luggage from the airfield.

387
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:20,258
-Oh, yes. Hello, Dennis.
-Hi.

388
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:23,302
-This is Captain Black.
-Hello, Captain Black.

389
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:27,432
-Hi, l'm Ugly John, your gas passer.
-Ugly John.

390
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:30,309
lt's only you, Judson. Captain Sacks.

391
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,520
Hello, Captain Sacks.
How's the operation going?

392
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,480
Are you kidding?

393
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:36,399
Scissors.

394
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:43,030
-And this is Captain Knocko McCarthy.
-Hello, Major. Right.

395
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:47,493
Now l'll show you the rest of the
operation, if you'll excuse the pun.

396
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:54,542
This is the pre-op ward.
l'll take these things.

397
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:58,337
This is the post-op ward.
lf you don't mind...

398
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,549
Vollmer, take care of these, will you?

399
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,343
-Finished work for the day?
-Yes. Why?

400
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:09,140
Good, good. l just wanted to make sure
you had time to sleep this off.

401
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:13,603
Son of a bitch!

402
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:16,481
Trapper! Captain Mclntyre!
What the hell...

403
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:19,317
-That's a captain?
-What's going on? Who started this?

404
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:22,236
l hit him! l hit him!
He's an ignoramus, that knucklehead!

405
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:25,781
He wouldn't have touched me
if l'd had my guard up.

406
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:28,993
Let us settle this, Colonel,
between ourselves. Alone!

407
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,370
What do you think l'm running,
an English boarding school?

408
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:32,747
Mclntyre, you're under arrest.

409
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,790
Confine yourself to quarters
pending an investigation.

410
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:38,753
-Henry, are you kidding?
-l deeply regret this unfortunate incident.

411
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,464
We try to remember
we're a military organization.

412
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,841
l should certainly hope so.

413
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:47,803
Vollmer, that man is under arrest.
Confine him to his quarters.

414
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:53,935
-Captain Mclntyre, you are officially...
-Come on. Cut it out, Vollmer.

415
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,527
Attention, camp compound.
Urine specimens will be required from all...

416
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,197
Disregard last transmission.

417
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,200
-l'm sorry, Colonel.
-What the hell's the matter with you?

418
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,785
-Henry, you want some coffee?
-Yes, please.

419
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,371
-Ho-Jon, get him some coffee.
-Well, what's wrong with you?

420
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:15,331
l don't know. l must have lost my punch.

421
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,833
l never expected
the son of a bitch to get up!

422
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:19,210
That's no kind of an answer.

423
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,545
Come on, Henry. You know why he did it.

424
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,339
l can't have my junior officers
striking each other.

425
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:27,301
Now, damn it, Henry.
Frank Burns is a menace!

426
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,387
Every time a patient croaks on him,

427
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:32,431
he says it's God's will
or somebody else's fault.

428
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:35,226
Yeah, this time he blamed it on some kid
who was stupid enough to believe him.

429
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,310
The hell with that.

430
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,062
l'm tired of you guys
trying to run this outfit.

431
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,565
This time, there's going to be
disciplinary action.

432
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:42,567
What are you going to do, Henry?

433
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:45,820
Well, l'd planned to name Trapper
chief surgeon

434
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:50,032
-to consult on your shift and Frank's.
-That's damn good thinking.

435
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:52,285
Yeah, but now l can't do it
for at least a week.

436
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:55,454
lf l announced it now after what
our new chief nurse saw this afternoon,

437
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:57,957
you'd hear her yelling
from Washington to Seoul.

438
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,667
Don't you have any sugar in this place?

439
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:05,047
Good morning. Today's musical
selections will be rendered by

440
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:08,342
Achi Takamura Seamuchiwa Bobcats.

441
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:12,138
Colonel Blake, General Hammond
did not answer the phone, sir!

442
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:14,307
They said he was at a football game.

443
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:17,935
-Those generals have all the fun!
-Yes, sir.

444
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:53,137
Attention. Attention.
May l have the camp's attention?

445
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:57,391
This week's movie will be
When Willie Comes Marching Home.

446
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:02,480
The biggest parade of laughs
of World War II.

447
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:07,652
All the loves, laughs and escapades
of the Willies who came marching home.

448
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:13,199
This film stars Dan Dailey,
Corinne Calvet and Colleen Townsend.

449
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,243
Captain Pierce, may l join you?

450
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:21,457
You've already joined me, gorgeous.
You're a sight for sore eyes.

451
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,918
Where do you come from?

452
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,213
Well, l like to think of the army
as my home.

453
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,048
Oh, yeah? Yeah?

454
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,885
Ho-Jon, you bring me some ketchup,
will you?

455
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,012
Captain, l've been observing
the nurses on your shift.

456
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:36,347
Yeah, l know. l saw you.

457
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,642
Naturally, your own opinion
is more informed than mine.

458
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:43,479
I think you would like to know what I think
of the nurses on my team. I'll tell you.

459
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,189
I think they're fine.
I think they're just great,

460
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,982
and I'm totally satisfied with them.

461
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:53,489
-Oh, no, that's the second time this week.
-Of course, what do you expect?

462
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,499
Welcome, gentlemen.

463
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:08,713
-When the lights go on again
-When the lights go on again

464
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,716
-All over the world
-All over the world

465
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,592
You got enough room?

466
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,223
Get rid of the line for me.

467
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:22,059
All over the world
All over the world

468
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:26,480
-ls he all right, Hawkeye?
-ls he all right, Dago?

469
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:29,692
Yes, you mean he's going to live?
He'll live.

470
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:35,614
l hope somebody's going to be around
tomorrow morning when he wakes up

471
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:39,994
to tell him that he hasn't got
anything between his legs anymore.

472
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,163
Syngman Rhee's paying the light bill.

473
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:46,041
-But Major Burns is far from satisfied.
-That doesn't surprise me.

474
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:49,754
Frank Burns does not know his way around
an operating theater.

475
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,922
He does not know his way around a body.

476
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,507
And if you'll have observed anything,

477
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:56,552
you'll have observed that
Major Frank Burns is an idiot.

478
00:34:56,636 --> 00:35:00,181
He has flipped his wig, that he is out
of his head, that he's a lousy surgeon.

479
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:03,350
On the contrary, l have observed

480
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:07,146
that Major Burns is not only
a good technical surgeon,

481
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,775
-he is a good military surgeon.
-You finished?

482
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:15,654
l have also noticed that nurses, as well as
enlisted men, address you as Hawkeye.

483
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,615
Yeah, because that's my name.
Hawkeye Pierce.

484
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,867
Well, that kind of informality
is inconsistent

485
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,077
with maximum efficiency
in a military organization.

486
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,038
Come off it, Major!

487
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:29,043
You've put me right off my fresh fried
lobster. Do you realize that?

488
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,628
l'm going to go back to my bed,

489
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:33,506
l'm going to put away
the best part of a bottle of Scotch

490
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:36,884
and under normal circumstances,
you being normally what l'd call

491
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,136
a very attractive woman,
l would have invited you back

492
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:43,307
to share my little bed with me
and you might possibly have come.

493
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,309
But you really put me off.

494
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:49,063
l mean, you're what we call
a regular army clown.

495
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:56,195
l wonder how a degenerated person
like that could have reached

496
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,365
a position of responsibility
in the army medical corps.

497
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,075
He was drafted.

498
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:18,926
-Radar!
-Your briefcase, sir.

499
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,763
-You're going to see Hammond...
-l'm spending the day with Hammond.

500
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,181
l'm gonna stay overnight.

501
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:25,683
Major Burns'll be in charge.

502
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:28,310
-Good luck.
-See you in the morning.

503
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:31,689
Sir, are there any last-minute instructions
you want to give to the men?

504
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,482
No, Radar has all
the necessary information.

505
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:35,860
Yeah, but who's going to be
on CQ tonight?

506
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:38,404
Wait a minute. What about the...

507
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,073
-Captain.
-Yes, sir.

508
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:44,118
l left some shirts on my bunk.
The buttons are missing.

509
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,203
Just ask somebody
to sew them up, please.

510
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:48,455
-l'd be glad to do them for you.
-You don't have to.

511
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:53,419
-lt's nothing, really. Great jacket. ls it new?
-Oh, yeah, my... lt was sent to me.

512
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,546
-You don't have to do that.
-Take care.

513
00:36:57,132 --> 00:37:01,218
Hail to the chief
he's the best of all the surgeons

514
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:05,306
-He needs a queen to satisfy his urgings
-He needs a queen to satisfy his urgings

515
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:09,476
Hail to the chief
he's the best of all the trappers

516
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:14,315
-He needs a queen to sit upon his lappers
-He needs a queen to sit upon his lappers

517
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:18,986
Hail to the chief
he's the best of all the cutters

518
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:23,324
He needs a queen
with a bigger pair of udders

519
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,617
-Hail to the chief...
-Hail to the chief...

520
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:27,953
Blake's gone out of his mind.
ls that going to go on all night?

521
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:32,791
He took his orders
and shoved them up his rectum

522
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:34,710
No, no. No food. No food.

523
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:39,298
-Sex. l want sex. Bring me some sex.
-Storch, Storch, come forth.

524
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:42,885
-No, no, no, that one. Bring me that one.
-He's chosen you! Congratulations!

525
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:47,097
That one. The sultry bitch with the fire
in her eyes. Take her clothes off.

526
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:49,600
l want that one! Yes! Yes!

527
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:53,520
Take her clothes off and bring her
to me now! l want her now!

528
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:59,401
Doctor! Doctor!
You forgot your shingle, Doctor.

529
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:18,504
"This letter has been written

530
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:24,718
-"in the interest of..."
-Army morale.

531
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:30,766
Good. "Army morale."

532
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,314
Get that thing out, will you?

533
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:38,440
You want to sing one, too?

534
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:41,986
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Radar's going to sing us our verse.

535
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:47,658
"This letter has been written
in the interest of army morale.

536
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,743
"As officers, we feel
it is our duty to bring this

537
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:52,162
"unwholesome situation
to your attention.

538
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,164
"We are writing this letterjointly
to assure you that

539
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:57,584
"no one's personal feeling
has any way influenced this report.

540
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,503
-"Respectfully, Margaret J. Houlihan."
-That's perfect.

541
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,587
-"Major Burns."
-That's perfect.

542
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,506
l think it's a marvelous letter.

543
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:06,260
-We make a good team, don't we?
-We think the same way.

544
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,928
Of course we do.

545
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:11,348
lt's almost suppertime.

546
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:15,853
-You're not hungry, are you?
-Ravenous. How about you?

547
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:18,480
For you, Margaret.

548
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:39,960
Now, the sooner this reaches him,

549
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:43,630
the sooner we can turn this
into a tight military outfit.

550
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:56,560
Attention, camp compound. Corporal
Judson has informed the colonel's office

551
00:39:56,644 --> 00:40:00,731
that three cases of amphetamine sulphate
are unaccounted for again.

552
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,859
This is the third occurrence
of this type in the last month.

553
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,403
It must stop,
by order of Colonel Blake's office,

554
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:08,655
4077th MASH unit.

555
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:13,202
l only wish l could deliver
that letter personally.

556
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:16,288
-Good night, Frank.
-Good night, Margaret.

557
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,916
l'll stop by later on to see if you're all right.

558
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,835
-Why, that won't be necessary.
-No, l don't mind.

559
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:24,671
l'll leave the door unlocked.

560
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,135
Attention.
Captain McIntyre will give a lecture

561
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,639
on blood and fluid replacement
in the mess hall at 0800.

562
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,725
Correction. At 021 ...

563
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,685
At 9:00 this evening.

564
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,315
Take your hat off, Radar.

565
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:47,152
-You're before the king... Queen.
-Don't get nervous, Radar.

566
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,407
Long live the chief...

567
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:55,536
The colonel... The colonel...

568
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:59,248
Long live the chief
The colonel did elect him

569
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:02,709
But he took all his orders
And shoved them up his nose

570
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:27,151
-You all right?
-Fine.

571
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,779
Godless buffoons, all of them.

572
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:35,951
lt's the disrespect for you, Frank.
That's what l can't forgive.

573
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,579
l'm used to it.

574
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,250
-Licorice?
-No, thank you.

575
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,922
What makes me sore
is how they behave towards you.

576
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:52,634
They ought to be grateful to have you.

577
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:57,097
l certainly am.

578
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,269
l'm grateful to have you, Frank.

579
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,320
We've grown very close in a short time.

580
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:17,451
lt isn't just chance. l'm sure of that.

581
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,290
God meant us to find each other.

582
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:27,294
-His will be done!
-Darling!

583
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,881
Frank! Frank!

584
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:38,096
l'll help you. Oh, yes.

585
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,770
Wait, wait. Get my robe.

586
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,439
Get my zipper. My zipper.

587
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:52,110
Oh, God! Careful, careful.

588
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,829
Get the searchlight on. Look.

589
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:08,669
Hey, put the light out.

590
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:13,215
Hi. What's going on? May l join you?

591
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:17,302
A little radio show from home.

592
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:23,016
-Yes, Frank.
-My zipper. Zipper.

593
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:28,563
-Frank. Yes. Frank.
-ls this the Bickersons? l love them.

594
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:32,150
-Who?
-The Battling Bickersons. I love it .

595
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:36,488
Frank.

596
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,826
Hard. Frank.

597
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:45,330
Harder, harder. Oh, my God.

598
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:52,838
No, l forgot. No, l...

599
00:43:56,592 --> 00:44:00,053
-You're shining that thing in my eyes.
-l'm sorry.

600
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:02,222
Darling...

601
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:05,225
He is such a sweet man.

602
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,730
Frank! Frank, my lips are hot.

603
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,898
Kiss my hot lips!

604
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:16,486
-Yes, they are hot.
-Hot? Hot Lips?

605
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:20,699
We have got to share this
with the rest of the camp.

606
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:24,036
-Switch it over.
-Okay.

607
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:26,913
Frank. Frank. Yes!

608
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,791
-Darling...
-Frank.

609
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:32,210
Frank, strangle me hard.

610
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:35,756
-Frank!
-What the hell is that?

611
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:38,133
Oh, yes!

612
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:43,430
Dr. Frank Burns is doing a bit
of dilatation and curettage.

613
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:51,355
-Sounds like the major's having a dream.
-She's plugged in.

614
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:55,150
Major. Frank.

615
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:59,029
-Frank. Wait a second.
-Frank. Wait a second.

616
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,155
-What is it?
-What is it?

617
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,449
-Turn the light off!
-Turn the light off!

618
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:05,744
-No! Let go! Turn the light off!
-No! Let go! Turn the light off!

619
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,622
-Get your clothes on.
-Get your clothes on.

620
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:09,706
-Get your pants on.
-Get your pants on.

621
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:11,708
-Don't shout at me.
-Don't shout at me.

622
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:13,710
-Don't shove me.
-Don't shove me.

623
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:31,728
lt's too bad Henry wasn't here.

624
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:33,980
He would've thought it was
a real radio program.

625
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,149
l thought it was a radio program.

626
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,110
l think we should send
a letter of commendation

627
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:40,404
to the Armed Forces Radio Network.

628
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:45,367
Wonderful. Yes. lt was the most
uplifting program l have ever heard.

629
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,536
lt was climactic.

630
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:55,961
Morning, ladies.

631
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:05,929
Well, hiya, Hot Lips.

632
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:11,351
Oh, my goodness, over my...
l'm so sorry to touch you, but l...

633
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:16,148
Well, what's the matter with her today?

634
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:18,358
l don't know.
l think it's one of those ladies' things.

635
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:21,361
-lt's not like her to act like this.
-No, l mean, she's made such a...

636
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:23,947
She's a bitch.
Look at my new flannel sweater.

637
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,532
l think she's gonna have
a nervous breakdown.

638
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:28,535
She can't even get out of the door. Look...

639
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:35,125
Morning, Frank.

640
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,962
Heard from your wife?

641
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,093
Morning, Colonel,
you forgot your briefcase.

642
00:46:45,178 --> 00:46:46,928
Yes, l left it in the jeep.

643
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:49,389
-You left it there.
-Yes. l forgot it. Got it.

644
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:50,807
-Morning, Captain.
-Morning, sir.

645
00:46:50,892 --> 00:46:52,934
l hope you didn't have to...
Here, take care of this.

646
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:56,897
l hope you didn't have to bother
with those shirts. lt wasn't necessary.

647
00:46:56,981 --> 00:47:01,067
-Too late, sir. lt's a done thing.
-Well, thank you. Morning, padre.

648
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:03,403
You know, l really got to assume...

649
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:10,619
-Colonel, sir. How was your visit, sir?
-Great. The general wasn't there.

650
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:17,501
Listen, about last night, sir, there was
just nothing l could do about it, sir.

651
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:19,211
-Nothing?
-Nothing.

652
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:22,881
-Well, it couldn't have been helped.
-Thank you, sir.

653
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,133
What's that?

654
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:28,136
Frank Burns and Hawkeye Pierce.
Very encouraging.

655
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:34,476
A bunch of the boys asked me to ask you,
Frank, what Hot Lips was like in the sack.

656
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,019
-You know, was she...
-Mind your own business.

657
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:39,856
No, Frank.
You know, is she better than self-abuse?

658
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:43,693
What's that all about?
He gonna get some pointers or something?

659
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,154
No, Hawkeye's gonna sign him up

660
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:49,032
to make a personal appearance tour
in all the camps in Korea.

661
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,408
ls that a fact?

662
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:52,577
Wonder what they're saying.
Can you make it out?

663
00:47:52,662 --> 00:47:55,830
Does that big ass of hers
move around a lot, Frank,

664
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:59,084
or does it sort of lie there flaccid?
What would you say about that?

665
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:03,964
Hawkeye's questioning the major
on a point of anatomy.

666
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:06,091
Very professional, exchanging ideas.

667
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:08,552
Would you say that
she was a moaner, Frank?

668
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:11,930
What is Burns saying?

669
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:14,140
Major Burns isn't saying
much of anything, sir.

670
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:16,059
l think he's formulating the answer.

671
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,644
Seriously, Frank. l mean, does she go...

672
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:22,107
Or does she just sort of lie there quiet
and not do anything at all?

673
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:25,110
-Keep your filthy mouth to yourself.
-Or does she go...

674
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:31,741
Get him off me! Get him off me!

675
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:34,077
What's going on, Frank?
ls that lesson one?

676
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,204
Frank Burns has gone nuts!

677
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,084
-Hey.
-Hey.

678
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,461
l'm wearing glasses, for God's sake!

679
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:44,921
Watch out for your goodies, Hawkeye.

680
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:48,133
That man is a sex maniac.
l don't think Hot Lips satisfied him.

681
00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:50,385
You're gonna kill him.

682
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,846
Don't let him kiss you, Hawkeye.

683
00:49:29,842 --> 00:49:34,346
Colonel, fair's fair. lf l nail Hot Lips
and punch Hawkeye, can l go home?

684
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,328
-Hawkeye!
-Yeah, l'll be there in a minute.

685
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,747
-Hawkeye!
-Shit.

686
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:03,375
Okay. Hey, listen, Seidman,
get another guy.

687
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:05,251
We gotta take this into the OR,
just on the stretcher.

688
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,338
Hold on, you're gonna be just fine, fella.

689
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,174
Okay. l can't move my hand.
Now, come on.

690
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,761
Have you got the cutdowns, darling?

691
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,889
You're gonna go to sleep.
You're gonna be just fine.

692
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,766
Hot Lips, let me have
one of your sterile knives, please.

693
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:23,019
-l'm gonna need two vascular clamps.
-All right.

694
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:24,854
And an arterial suture.

695
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:26,231
As soon as you give me the clamp,

696
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:28,942
l want you to be ready to gown
and glove me. All right?

697
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,360
-Ready? Okay.
-Yeah.

698
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,529
Here we go. lt's gonna spurt a bit. Okay.

699
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:35,699
-You got it?
-Aye, aye, baby.

700
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:38,702
-Clamp.
-Yeah.

701
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,833
Okay, gown.

702
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,921
-Gloves. You got an arterial suture ready?
-Yeah.

703
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:53,383
Okay. Ugly, move out of the way
'cause l'm looking around over there.

704
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:57,637
Baby, we're gonna see some stitching
like you never saw before!

705
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,389
Attention. Attention.

706
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,557
-You got it?
-Okay. Here she goes.

707
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:01,641
This is Colonel Blake's office.

708
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,601
-The American Medical Association...
-Straight off and running.

709
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:06,312
...has just declared marijuana
a dangerous drug.

710
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:08,982
Despite earlier claims by some physicians

711
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:12,694
that it is no more harmful than alcohol,
this is now found to be the case.

712
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,028
That is all.

713
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:15,613
Oh, really?

714
00:51:16,157 --> 00:51:18,199
When did you get them?
Let me try it on you.

715
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:19,826
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

716
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:24,080
Hey, Dago Reddo!
Hi. You're just in time for cocktails.

717
00:51:24,165 --> 00:51:26,750
-Come on in.
-No. No, thank you. l can't, really.

718
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:29,586
-Hawkeye. Hawkeye.
-Okay, Red.

719
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,546
-Could l speak to you?
-Yeah, sure.

720
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,006
No, outside.

721
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,718
-What?
-l have to talk to you outside.

722
00:51:40,181 --> 00:51:41,931
-You all right?
-Hiya, Pup-Pup.

723
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,268
Sorry to drag you away from the gang
in there, but...

724
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:48,271
-What?
-This'll only take a moment.

725
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:51,274
-There's a problem with Walt Waldowski.
-Painless?

726
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,401
-Painless.
-You got a toothache? He's a good dentist.

727
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:56,988
No, no, no, it's not my problem.
See, it's his problem.

728
00:51:57,615 --> 00:52:01,326
-What do you mean? What is it?
-Well, what is it... That's...

729
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:03,286
lt's difficult to talk about, you see,

730
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:07,332
because l learned about his problem
in confession.

731
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:10,168
-And you can't...
-l can't divulge.

732
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,712
-Can you give me a hint?
-But l...

733
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,090
-Just an idea?
-Well, no.

734
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:20,553
But l can tell you how serious it is.

735
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:23,223
He and the boys were playing poker

736
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:25,642
and one of the boys turned to him
and asked him

737
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:28,937
for a ruling on one of the hands.

738
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:32,148
And Walt said, he said,

739
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:35,735
"What does it matter? lt's only a game."

740
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:39,155
Painless said,
"What does it matter? lt's only a game"?

741
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,282
-Poker, only a game?
-Yeah.

742
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:44,661
Yeah, that's what l thought.

743
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:47,705
l guess l better go see a man
about a tooth.

744
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,457
Thank you.

745
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:53,086
-See, l didn't know what to do.
-Pup-Pup.

746
00:52:53,963 --> 00:52:56,422
You see, there are some...

747
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:59,509
There are some things
that absolution just...

748
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,594
Well...

749
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,890
Seven, eight, Jack.
Straight. Three on a low.

750
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:11,187
Four, three... Hawkeye, there's
an empty chair here looking for a player.

751
00:53:11,272 --> 00:53:13,815
Baby, l've got a toothache
like you can't believe.

752
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:17,944
Why do you bring that dog in here?
Last time you did l lost $30.

753
00:53:18,571 --> 00:53:21,489
Listen, why do you have to sit right
behind me? lt makes me very nervous.

754
00:53:21,574 --> 00:53:23,408
lt brings me a lot of luck. Sit there, Boone.

755
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:26,661
-Come on. Let's play, man.
-Deuce. Ace.

756
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,747
-Can l take some of your Scotch?
-Sure.

757
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:31,583
-You want some?
-No.

758
00:53:34,003 --> 00:53:36,796
-How you feeling?
-No, no, don't touch me.

759
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,215
Look, if...

760
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:43,636
lf a man isn't a man anymore,

761
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:49,225
what's he got left
that he should be living for?

762
00:53:51,437 --> 00:53:53,563
Okay, tell me about it. What's the story?

763
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:58,443
Well, you know that little nurse that was
through here last night with the 325th?

764
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:01,946
-The little one with the big boobs.
-Yeah, l know. Yeah.

765
00:54:02,031 --> 00:54:03,698
Well, anyway, l...

766
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:08,161
l wasn't gonna fool around out here
because l got these...

767
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,915
l got these three girls
that l'm engaged to back home.

768
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:15,335
And you wanted to be faithful to them.
Baby, you are 7,000 miles from home.

769
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:20,006
Yeah, well, anyway,
l took her out last night and l failed.

770
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:23,801
-You mean she wouldn't put out? Well...
-No, she wanted to, in the worst way.

771
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:25,929
But it was me. l just couldn't...

772
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:30,516
-You couldn't... lt wouldn't...
-Yeah, nothing happened. Not at all. No.

773
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:32,310
Baby, that happens to everybody.

774
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,937
lt's happened to me
maybe four or five times.

775
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:35,271
lt's 'cause you're tired...

776
00:54:35,356 --> 00:54:38,107
Yeah, well,
it's never happened to me before.

777
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:41,361
Come on. You're the best-equipped dentist
in the army.

778
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:45,406
-You're the dental Don Juan of Detroit.
-That's just a cover-up.

779
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,243
-What's a cover-up?
-Don Juanism.

780
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:51,287
l've been reading about it all day.
lt's a cover-up.

781
00:54:51,372 --> 00:54:53,456
lt's a cover-up for what?

782
00:54:55,376 --> 00:54:56,584
Well...

783
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:00,964
l'm a fairy.

784
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:06,594
A victim of latent homosexuality.
l've turned into a fairy.

785
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:20,274
-Have you... Have you done anything?
-No, but it's only a matter of time.

786
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,735
Boy, l just can't face it.

787
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:28,741
Look, Hawkeye, suppose that
you found out that you were one, huh?

788
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:29,826
-One...
-Yeah.

789
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:32,996
Well, you wouldn't like breaking the news
to your wife.

790
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,998
No, l can see that that would be a problem.

791
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:38,543
Yeah, well, l got the same problem,
only multiplied.

792
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,963
Well, you know, Man O' War,

793
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:47,719
after they retired him from racing,
they put him out to stud.

794
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:55,143
And he had an average of about 1 20,

795
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:59,897
1 30 foals every year,

796
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:02,400
and he lived to be 36.

797
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:05,194
And then when he died,
they did an autopsy

798
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:08,364
and they found out
that he was a raving queen.

799
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:12,952
No, that's a little-known fact,
but it's the truth.

800
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:15,621
Well, then, Painless has got a couple
of good years left in him, doesn't he?

801
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:18,041
Maybe more.
He hasn't even started raving yet.

802
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:22,003
Painless is a dentist, and a dentist
shouldn't read. That's his whole problem.

803
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:24,839
His problem is that he believes it.
l mean, he really is convinced.

804
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:28,843
lt's an obsession, and it's a vital force.

805
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,721
Here he comes! The jawbreaker.

806
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,848
No, don't worry.
He's not gonna break anything.

807
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:36,059
Just act natural.

808
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:47,653
Hey, Painless. How's she going?

809
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:50,239
Something in a marshmallow?

810
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:55,203
No, it's okay, fellas.
l know you've been talking about me.

811
00:56:57,831 --> 00:57:01,709
Well, l came over to tell you
that l've decided that

812
00:57:01,794 --> 00:57:03,961
l'm going to commit suicide.

813
00:57:07,508 --> 00:57:10,635
Well, if you're really gonna
go ahead and do it,

814
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:14,180
do you think you could leave me
your record player?

815
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,432
-Sure.
-Thank you.

816
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:20,603
Gonna miss you, Painless.
How do you plan to do it?

817
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,563
A .45 between the eyes?

818
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:25,399
-That's awful sloppy.
-lt's reliable, though.

819
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:28,945
Well, that's another thing
l wanted to ask you.

820
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:31,572
l'm sort of new at this game, and...

821
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:34,492
Do you have any particular method
that you'd recommend?

822
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:38,621
l don't know. l think my colleagues and l
could come up with something

823
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:41,833
-to relinquish the vital forces of their...
-Black capsule.

824
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:45,044
-Black capsule.
-Of course. That's neat.

825
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:48,089
What's a black capsule?
Do you have any of them? Does it work?

826
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,799
lt worked for Hitler and Eva Braun.

827
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:51,425
-lt should work for you.
-lt's simple and it's effective.

828
00:57:52,553 --> 00:57:53,970
Hawkeye, l really must...

829
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:56,556
l should check with
the military vicar's office.

830
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,977
You see, l cannot give absolution to a man
who is about to commit suicide.

831
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:02,228
lt's a mortal sin.

832
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:06,023
Look, Dago, he is not committing suicide.
He is only intending to commit suicide.

833
00:58:06,108 --> 00:58:08,860
So you're not dealing with an act,
you're dealing with an intention.

834
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:12,321
And if it works, if what we're doing works,
then he will not commit suicide,

835
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:14,657
so therefore
you're preventing a mortal sin. Okay?

836
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,659
Well, l should check.

837
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:19,453
-Well, you check on it.
-Well, there's...

838
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:07,126
All right, where you at? There you go.

839
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:14,675
Now, then, you've all come here
to say your final farewell to old Walt here.

840
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,261
-Farewell, Walt.
-Dear old Walt.

841
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:23,017
You know, l got an idea that maybe
it's not such a final farewell after all.

842
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:27,271
l think maybe old Walt's going on
into the unknown

843
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:30,191
to do a little recon work for us all.

844
00:59:30,651 --> 00:59:33,110
l just want to say one thing.

845
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:35,738
Nobody ordered Walt
to go on this mission.

846
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:38,908
-He volunteered for certain death.
-That's true.

847
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:41,118
That's what we award
our highest medals for.

848
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:44,956
-That's beautiful.
-That's what being a soldier is all about.

849
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,583
-Yeah. Hear! Hear!
-Yes. Yes.

850
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:52,838
Gentlemen, l think there's only one person
who has anything to add to that,

851
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:56,842
-and that's Dago Red.
-The padre. Let's hear it for the padre.

852
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:06,852
Walt, here's your black capsule.

853
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:13,484
Look, this thing works pretty fast,
doesn't it?

854
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:16,320
l think l better go lie down over there.

855
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:20,283
Walt, that'll help you.

856
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:28,833
Through early morning fog I see

857
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:33,921
Visions of the things to be

858
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:39,593
The pains that are withheld for me

859
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:45,182
I realize and I can see

860
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:53,649
That suicide is painless

861
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:58,112
It brings on many changes

862
01:00:58,322 --> 01:01:04,952
And I can take or leave it if I please

863
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:11,917
The game of life is hard to play

864
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:15,921
I'm going to lose it anyway

865
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:20,343
The losing card I'll someday lay

866
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:25,264
So this is all I have to say

867
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,018
That suicide is painless

868
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:32,688
Wherever you go, take this. Good luck.

869
01:01:32,773 --> 01:01:35,649
It brings on many changes

870
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:39,236
And I can take or leave it if I please

871
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:42,114
l'll always remember you just like this.

872
01:01:44,576 --> 01:01:48,245
The only way to win is cheat

873
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:52,583
And lay it down before I'm beat

874
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:57,088
And to another give my seat

875
01:01:57,172 --> 01:02:01,884
For that's the only painless feat

876
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:03,260
Painless.

877
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:08,015
Suicide is painless

878
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,142
It brings on many changes

879
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:12,561
lt was really nice of you.
Thanks for asking me.

880
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:15,231
And I can take or leave it if I please

881
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:16,524
Thing is,

882
01:02:17,943 --> 01:02:20,778
you're throwing
your whole education away.

883
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:24,740
And you can do

884
01:02:24,825 --> 01:02:26,909
Good night, jawbreaker.

885
01:02:28,036 --> 01:02:31,539
The same thing

886
01:02:31,623 --> 01:02:37,753
If you please

887
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,277
Hi, baby.

888
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:04,447
-Hi.
-l'm glad you could come.

889
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:07,158
Sorry it was so late.

890
01:03:07,242 --> 01:03:10,870
That's okay. l really couldn't sleep anyway.
l'm so nervous.

891
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:20,171
You leaving tomorrow?

892
01:03:22,883 --> 01:03:25,968
Yeah. l'll be on my way
in less than 1 2 hours.

893
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:31,932
l suppose who it's going to be really
roughest on, though, is your husband.

894
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:36,896
Why are you all of a sudden
so concerned with him?

895
01:03:37,856 --> 01:03:40,316
l mean, a man would be
more considerate to his wife.

896
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,443
He wouldn't go home a nervous wreck.

897
01:03:43,111 --> 01:03:46,489
You're just going to have to stop using
logic 'cause you're just proving...

898
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:48,157
lt could be a purely impersonal thing.

899
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,868
...why l shouldn't go to bed with you.

900
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:53,370
l didn't mean me.

901
01:03:57,209 --> 01:04:00,169
You have the rare privilege that happens
on certain occasions

902
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:03,297
to chief executives of states or nations.

903
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:07,676
You have the privilege
of restoring a human being's life

904
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:09,762
by a tender act of mercy.

905
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,517
What is this? Hawkeye, is he dead?

906
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:17,520
No, no.

907
01:04:18,146 --> 01:04:20,356
He's not dead. Not yet.

908
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:23,776
Painless has a grave
psychological problem,

909
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,195
and you're the only person
who can help him.

910
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:29,657
Oh, no, Hawkeye. Oh, no. Come on.

911
01:04:29,741 --> 01:04:31,784
No, Maria.
No, you've got to look on this as a nurse.

912
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:35,204
Painless needs it for therapeutic value.

913
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:38,541
lt will help him, and it certainly
wouldn't do you any harm, either,

914
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:39,792
to think about it for a bit.

915
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,961
lf you think that your virtue
is more important

916
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:44,380
than Painless' life, that's fine.
That's entirely up to you.

917
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:49,134
l just want you to stay here
and be with him for a minute.

918
01:04:49,261 --> 01:04:51,428
Just look at him.

919
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:56,016
-Just stay close to the whole man.
-Oh, Hawkeye!

920
01:04:57,686 --> 01:04:59,311
And look at him.

921
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:05,734
Hawkeye!

922
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:10,614
This is ridiculous.

923
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:51,822
You forgot your hat! You wouldn't
want to leave without a souvenir.

924
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:53,532
Have a good trip.

925
01:05:55,327 --> 01:05:58,704
Lieutenant Schneider, you forgot to pick up
your traveling orders. Wait a second!

926
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:03,000
You're supposed to pick...
These are your traveling orders.

927
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:10,132
-Morning, Painless.
-Hi, Hawkeye.

928
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,551
How's she going?

929
01:06:12,844 --> 01:06:15,012
Slept like a doll last night.

930
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:16,430
Well, can't waste time. Big day.

931
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:19,141
Got two jaws to rebuild.
Come on, Seidman.

932
01:06:21,269 --> 01:06:22,895
Have a good day.

933
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:48,003
Attention. Attention.

934
01:06:48,088 --> 01:06:50,798
Religious services for Yom Kippur
will be held this...

935
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:55,010
Will not, will not be held this Friday
due to mitigating circumstances.

936
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:57,262
For those who wish to observe
said holiday,

937
01:06:57,347 --> 01:07:00,140
Sunday has been reserved. That is all.

938
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:02,851
-Trapper, this one's for you, babe.
-Knife.

939
01:07:04,312 --> 01:07:05,979
That man is a prisoner of war, Doctor.

940
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:08,732
So are you, sweetheart,
but you don't know it.

941
01:07:08,817 --> 01:07:12,027
-lt's in pretty deep.
-l think that was my finger.

942
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:16,031
Now, l need your help, Hawkeye.
lt's hit more than a lung.

943
01:07:16,116 --> 01:07:18,617
-What do you think?
-l don't know.

944
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,869
-Hey, Radar.
-Yes.

945
01:07:20,954 --> 01:07:24,331
Radar, has that A negative come in from
Seoul yet? l need some in right away.

946
01:07:24,416 --> 01:07:27,876
-We keep ordering it, but it never arrives.
-How'd the kid take the induction, Ugly?

947
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:29,753
Good. He's ready.

948
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:32,131
Pickups and irrigation, please.

949
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:34,466
-We good?
-Yeah.

950
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:35,968
All right, give me some gel foam.

951
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,471
Not now, honey. Go back to sleep.

952
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,481
Scissors.

953
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,401
-Sponge.
-More sponges.

954
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:56,697
-Let's have the suction up here. Thank you.
-Rib spreader.

955
01:07:57,615 --> 01:08:01,827
-Clamp.
-Let's give him a sexy scar, huh? Fantastic.

956
01:08:02,162 --> 01:08:03,162
There's a lot of blood.

957
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:04,288
-Sponge.
-Go ahead.

958
01:08:04,372 --> 01:08:07,416
-Scissors. Watch it.
-Give me something to stuff it in with.

959
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,917
-Clamp.
-Pickups to me, please.

960
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:10,502
How's he tolerating this, Ugly John?

961
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:13,338
-Good. He's young.
-Things get slippery in there, man.

962
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:14,840
You're a backhanded guy.

963
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:17,176
Let me have the forceps
and a sponge stick.

964
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:20,929
Hot Lips, you may be a pain in the ass,
but you're a damn good nurse.

965
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:24,349
-Thanks, Trapper.
-Put in the blood there, will you, John?

966
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,518
There's a clot on the cava,
just above the atrium, though.

967
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:27,936
Must be the point of entry.

968
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:29,188
Clamp.

969
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:35,611
l feel a fragment right underneath the clot.

970
01:08:35,695 --> 01:08:37,780
-You control the cava.
-Okay.

971
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:40,616
-We got to stop that spurting.
-Clamp.

972
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,826
-Do what?
-Stop the spurting.

973
01:08:42,911 --> 01:08:45,412
That's a very good technical term.

974
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:47,956
Oh, Christ. lt's not in the cava.

975
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:50,083
lt's in the pulmonary artery
in the left side.

976
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:53,003
Okay, let me close him up, sit on it
for a couple of days till we get the blood.

977
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:55,130
We can't sit on it for a couple of days.
What if we get jammed up?

978
01:08:55,215 --> 01:08:57,007
We don't have the blood!

979
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,384
We got to turn him over.
lf you cut again, you'll lose him.

980
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:03,514
Look, Hawkeye, the artery can erode.
l would...

981
01:09:03,598 --> 01:09:05,974
Now's the time to take our shot.
We got to shoot crap.

982
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:09,019
-A negative. lt's been cross-matched.
-You said you didn't have any blood.

983
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:10,270
l found a donor.

984
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:15,317
You know, up close, all crumpled up like
that, they don't look like much, you know.

985
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:17,903
Hey, was he loaded or empty
when he crashed?

986
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:20,823
No, he was loaded,
but it didn't matter much.

987
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:24,284
You see, the two guys
he was carrying were dead already.

988
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:26,203
What about the pilot?
What happened to him?

989
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:28,497
Pilot's fine. Took off a kneecap,

990
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:30,791
and he lost the function
in his right hand, but he's great.

991
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:34,419
l didn't hear. What color was her hair?

992
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:37,172
Black, shiny. Shiny, black hair.

993
01:09:37,257 --> 01:09:42,719
Black? You like black?
l'm kind of partial to blonde myself.

994
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:47,641
l knew it. l knew you had
an attraction for Hot Lips Houlihan.

995
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:49,935
-Hear! Hear!
-Go to hell, Captain Pierce.

996
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:52,521
You know l damn near puke
every time l look at her.

997
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:55,482
Besides, l'll bet she's not a real blonde.

998
01:09:55,567 --> 01:10:00,612
How dare you say that about
an officer of the United States Army, sir?

999
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:04,992
l'll not only say it,
but l'll back it with 20 bucks. How's that?

1000
01:10:05,076 --> 01:10:07,953
You have yourself a bet, sir.
You're my witness.

1001
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:10,789
l'll be a witness, but who's going to be
the poor schmuckwho finds out?

1002
01:10:10,874 --> 01:10:15,460
Well, l could, if no one else wants, l...

1003
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:20,674
No, no. We got to all see it together
somehow.

1004
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:37,816
You know, it's five minutes after the time
the nurses usually take their shower.

1005
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:40,152
-Where are they?
-They will be here.

1006
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,447
Finest kind, Ho-Jon.

1007
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:46,825
-What's happening?
-Radar.

1008
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,161
-You see the papers?
-What?

1009
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,621
-You don't know about the papers?
-What papers?

1010
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:51,788
The Colonel left some papers.

1011
01:10:51,873 --> 01:10:55,334
-Why didn't you tell me about the papers?
-l tried to tell you.

1012
01:10:57,837 --> 01:11:00,923
Here you go, here you go. They're coming.

1013
01:11:09,432 --> 01:11:11,892
-Evelyn, could you give me a hand?
-Sure.

1014
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:15,520
Hey, Frankie, could you take a look
at my corns, please?

1015
01:11:16,564 --> 01:11:18,649
Knocko, the pictures of my kids
have come.

1016
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:20,275
The pictures of my kids have come.

1017
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,319
Hot Lips, would you like to see
the pictures of my kids?

1018
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:24,571
l'm not the slightest bit interested.

1019
01:12:43,151 --> 01:12:44,526
Bravo!

1020
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:47,946
Bravo! Bravo!

1021
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:51,324
Bravo! Author! Bravo!

1022
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:57,330
Bravo! Author! Author!

1023
01:12:57,415 --> 01:12:58,999
20 bucks, huh?

1024
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:01,376
You win the bet.

1025
01:13:01,461 --> 01:13:03,503
You bastards!

1026
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:17,059
-Major, what went on over there...
-Where's Colonel Blake?

1027
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:18,518
Wait a second.
You can't go and see Colonel Blake.

1028
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:20,645
You shut up, you twerp!

1029
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:31,573
This isn't a hospital!
lt's an insane asylum!

1030
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:36,244
And it's your fault because you don't
do anything to discourage them!

1031
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:40,040
-What do you want me to do?
-Put them under arrest!

1032
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:44,169
See what a court-martial thinks
of their drunken hooliganism!

1033
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:49,841
At first they called me Hot Lips,
and you let them get away with it,

1034
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:53,762
and then you let them
get away with everything!

1035
01:13:55,348 --> 01:14:00,852
lf you don't turn them over
to the MP this minute,

1036
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:06,108
l'm going to resign my commission!

1037
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:09,903
God damn it, Hot Lips,
resign your goddamn commission.

1038
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:21,873
My commission!

1039
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:24,543
A little more wine, my dear?

1040
01:14:24,627 --> 01:14:26,211
Yes, please.

1041
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:36,972
Don't forget to get your mother
her present.

1042
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:39,558
You know what l want to get her?

1043
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:41,143
Come on, baby.

1044
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:46,398
Come on. You all right?
Keep it straight, eh?

1045
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:49,192
No. First of all, the present,
then dinner, then the movie.

1046
01:14:49,277 --> 01:14:51,111
-You mean all, all three of us?
-Who is this?

1047
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:52,863
Where l go, Warren goes.

1048
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:54,906
What? You don't want me to go with you?

1049
01:14:56,409 --> 01:14:58,451
-lt's not that.
-l think...

1050
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:01,079
Oh, yes, l do!

1051
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:05,500
He's Syngman Rhee's son,
and he goes right in.

1052
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,504
Come on, Bandini.

1053
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:18,680
Hey, soldier!

1054
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:24,769
-Me?
-Yeah, you. Where you from?

1055
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:28,690
-A MASH outfit at the frontline.
-No, l mean your hometown.

1056
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:30,859
lt's on the East Coast.

1057
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:33,028
Have you been wounded yet?

1058
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:38,116
Yeah, a little, a slight...

1059
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,827
Would you like to say hello
to your mother?

1060
01:15:40,912 --> 01:15:43,496
Well, my mother's dead, actually.
She's deceased.

1061
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:46,082
Well, l'm sorry.

1062
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:50,378
-l'd like to say hello to my father, if l could.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine, fine.

1063
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:53,381
Hi, Dad.

1064
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:23,495
Excuse me. l am making an examination
of this young man

1065
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:26,915
to find out if he would be
a soldier in our army.

1066
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:30,627
Oh, yeah, l know. Hi, Ho-Jon.
How's she going, boy?

1067
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:33,171
His heartbeat is much too fast,

1068
01:16:33,256 --> 01:16:37,050
and his blood pressure
is dangerously high.

1069
01:16:37,134 --> 01:16:38,385
Oh, yeah?

1070
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:42,973
l guess you probably think
he's unfit for the army, eh?

1071
01:16:43,057 --> 01:16:48,353
Yes, at first. But when l saw on his paper
he worked in an American hospital

1072
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:52,524
where there are many drugs,
and he could have taken some by mistake.

1073
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:55,735
-What would he do a thing like that for?
-Who knows?

1074
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:59,281
To find the truth, l will keep him here
with me for a couple of days.

1075
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:02,701
By tomorrow, his fast heart
and high blood pressure may be gone.

1076
01:17:02,785 --> 01:17:06,121
-Look...
-So l suggest you say goodbye to him now.

1077
01:17:06,205 --> 01:17:08,665
-Doctor, l've...
-lt was a nice try. lt was a nice try.

1078
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:10,125
Come on, Ho-Jon.

1079
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,173
Oh, man!

1080
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:22,012
The following program is brought to you
through Radio Tokyo by courtesy

1081
01:17:22,096 --> 01:17:27,058
of the Veterans of Foreign Wars,
Post Number 63 of Sedalia, Missouri.

1082
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:29,561
A federal court rules that
E.I. Du Pont De Nemours & Company,

1083
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:32,605
Remington Arms Company Inc.,

1084
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:36,109
and the Imperial Chemical Industries
Limited of Great Britain

1085
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:39,571
have conspired to divide munition...

1086
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:05,347
Hey!

1087
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:10,352
ldiot! He knocked me down the hill!
He broke my umbrella!

1088
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:16,983
l wish they wouldn't land these things here
when we're playing golf.

1089
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:21,529
-That's him on the right.
-Fore!

1090
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:23,531
-Wait! Wait!
-Captain...

1091
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:26,368
The lieutenant's come all the way
from Seoul, sir, just to see you.

1092
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:29,037
-You're Captain Mclntyre?
-Yes, l'm Captain...

1093
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:31,539
Lieutenant, you look terrible.

1094
01:18:31,624 --> 01:18:34,042
Captain, look at his eyes.
Let me see your tongue.

1095
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:37,712
Oh, no, no. Here, take your shirt off
and tell me where it hurts.

1096
01:18:37,797 --> 01:18:41,591
l haven't seen a case like this
since l was in school. Oh, my goodness.

1097
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:44,677
Listen, Vollmer, tell them
to prepare the major surgery.

1098
01:18:44,762 --> 01:18:47,222
This is one case in five.
l think l can save you, Lieutenant.

1099
01:18:47,306 --> 01:18:49,974
You're to proceed to
Kokura, Japan immediately.

1100
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:52,394
Kokura, Japan! What's this all about?

1101
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:54,145
Yeah. His dad's a Congressman.

1102
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:56,815
Grenade went off in practice.
There's a piece in his heart.

1103
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:59,442
-What?
-Gl's dad's a Congressman.

1104
01:18:59,527 --> 01:19:01,986
Grenade went off in practice.
Piece in his heart.

1105
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:04,614
-That the x-rays?
-Yeah.

1106
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:09,119
Apparently some big heart surgeon
in Boston told the Congressman

1107
01:19:09,203 --> 01:19:14,124
the only man to take care of his son
is Captain John Mclntyre.

1108
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:19,671
Of course, l suppose there could be
two Captain John Mclntyres.

1109
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:22,090
No, no, l'm the only John Mclntyre.

1110
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:25,176
Look, Hammond says l can take along
someone to assist me if l need him.

1111
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:26,678
-You want to come?
-Yeah.

1112
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:31,975
Lieutenant, l think l can save you.
Look, take one of these every half-hour.

1113
01:19:32,059 --> 01:19:34,811
Now, get into your helicopter and button
up your shirt, for crying out loud!

1114
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:37,522
You're in the military army!

1115
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:40,692
-That piece isn't even close to his heart.
-l know, l know. lt's nothing.

1116
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:43,987
But, look, how many times do you
get to go to Japan with your golf clubs?

1117
01:19:44,071 --> 01:19:45,363
Come on, Shirley.

1118
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:30,325
Goddamn army.

1119
01:20:38,626 --> 01:20:40,585
Goddamn army jeep.

1120
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:46,341
Excuse me, soldier.

1121
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:48,259
l wonder if you could tell me
where the Congressman's son is?

1122
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:50,762
-He's in Ward 6.
-Darling, would you register for us?

1123
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:52,514
-Just a moment!
-Ward 6.

1124
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:55,517
You can't go in there. Who are you?

1125
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:57,268
Who am l? l am the pro from Dover,

1126
01:20:57,353 --> 01:20:58,728
-and this is my favorite caddy.
-l don't believe you.

1127
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:00,522
You can't go in till l call Captain Peterson.

1128
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:02,524
-We already called Captain Peterson.
-Wait a second.

1129
01:21:02,608 --> 01:21:03,900
lf this soldier wants to enforce
her own orders,

1130
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:06,819
l'm going to take her on single-handedly.

1131
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:09,405
-Get away!
-You open this.

1132
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:11,950
-He's won two Purple Hearts.
-You can't...

1133
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:14,619
-l'll ravage your body, lady.
-You stay away from me. l'll call the police.

1134
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:17,580
-You can't come in here! You can't.
-You have not seen such a beast, lady.

1135
01:21:17,665 --> 01:21:20,792
l'm going to call Captain Peterson.
You stay away from me!

1136
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:27,549
Captain Peterson, please.

1137
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:29,300
Captain Peterson!

1138
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:36,015
What are you two hoodlums
doing in this hospital?

1139
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:38,184
Ma'am, we are surgeons
and we're here to operate.

1140
01:21:38,269 --> 01:21:39,727
We're just waiting for a starting time,
that's all.

1141
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:41,312
Well, you can't even go near a patient

1142
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:44,232
until Colonel Merrill says it's okay,
and he's still out to lunch.

1143
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:46,234
Look, Mother, l want to go to work
in one hour.

1144
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:49,904
We are the pros from Dover,
and we figure to crack this kid's chest

1145
01:21:49,989 --> 01:21:52,073
and get out to the golf course
before it gets dark.

1146
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:53,575
So you go find the gas passer,

1147
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:55,410
and you have him
pre-medicate this patient,

1148
01:21:55,494 --> 01:21:56,953
then bring me the latest pictures on him.

1149
01:21:57,037 --> 01:21:59,414
The ones we saw
must be 48 hours old by now.

1150
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:02,041
Then call the kitchen
and have them rustle us up some lunch.

1151
01:22:02,126 --> 01:22:03,918
Ham and eggs will be all right.
Steak would be even better.

1152
01:22:04,003 --> 01:22:07,005
And then give me at least one nurse
who knows how to work in close

1153
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:08,840
without getting her tits in my way.

1154
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:12,010
Oh, you fool.

1155
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:17,307
How do you want your steak cooked?

1156
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:23,396
Towel.

1157
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:32,447
Say the magic words, you make $1 00.

1158
01:22:35,909 --> 01:22:39,120
All right! l demand an explanation.

1159
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:41,623
Somebody get that dirty old man
out of this operating theater.

1160
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:43,333
Dirty old man...

1161
01:22:44,043 --> 01:22:45,418
l'm Colonel Merrill.

1162
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:49,005
l don't care if you're Jack Armstrong,
the All-American Boy.

1163
01:22:49,089 --> 01:22:53,176
lf this chest gets infected,
l will tell the Congressman who did it.

1164
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:56,262
-Scissors, please.
-Will you let me have a skin suture?

1165
01:22:56,347 --> 01:22:57,722
Load pickups.

1166
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:01,684
-Who was that?
-That's Colonel Merrill.

1167
01:23:01,769 --> 01:23:04,562
-This is his little store here.
-Oh, yeah?

1168
01:23:05,397 --> 01:23:06,814
Who are you?

1169
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:10,902
l'm Dr. Jekyll, actually.
This is my friend, Mr. Hyde.

1170
01:23:13,072 --> 01:23:15,281
Then why don't you save
your rapier-like wit

1171
01:23:15,366 --> 01:23:18,117
for the clam diggers back home, Hawkeye?

1172
01:23:20,871 --> 01:23:22,413
Approximate her.

1173
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:26,918
Did l ever tell you about my friend,
"Me Lai" Marston?

1174
01:23:27,294 --> 01:23:28,378
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1175
01:23:28,462 --> 01:23:29,796
That friend of yours
who would go around saying,

1176
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:33,841
"Me lay, you lay" to all the girls,
and, what, he'd score once out of 50 times.

1177
01:23:33,926 --> 01:23:35,593
Yeah, you told me about him.

1178
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:38,846
He's passing gas
for the Congressman's son here.

1179
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:42,016
Really? When he's not passing gas,
does he play golf?

1180
01:23:42,101 --> 01:23:43,601
l don't know.

1181
01:23:43,936 --> 01:23:46,854
-Do you play golf?
-No. l have no time for golf.

1182
01:23:46,939 --> 01:23:51,192
l'm moonlighting down at Dr. Yamachi's
New Era Hospital and Whorehouse.

1183
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:53,194
This old guy that l met
when l first came over here,

1184
01:23:53,278 --> 01:23:55,238
he's got a little crude hospital for kids

1185
01:23:55,322 --> 01:23:58,241
and he finances it with a whorehouse,
all in the same building.

1186
01:23:58,617 --> 01:24:02,328
lt's the NEHWH. Come on down,
and we'll get something going for you.

1187
01:24:02,413 --> 01:24:05,581
-l've got an in, in Kokura!
-Here, soldier, take these,

1188
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:07,458
and take our golf carts, and... Be careful.

1189
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:09,794
Don't drop any of those things
'cause we're going to play golf later.

1190
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:11,379
-lt's important.
-Goodbye, pimp.

1191
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:14,257
-Ladies.
-Girls.

1192
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:16,801
Gentlemen. Be careful with that...

1193
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:19,470
Military police.

1194
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:41,325
All right, fellas, the game's over.

1195
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:45,663
Finally caught up with us, huh?

1196
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:49,167
Where did we fail?

1197
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:51,210
l don't know. l think it was the woman.

1198
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:54,172
Something tells me
l've seen her some place before.

1199
01:24:54,882 --> 01:24:57,008
She was the one in Tangiers.

1200
01:24:57,885 --> 01:25:02,180
You can wait in the colonel's office.
He'll be back in a few minutes.

1201
01:25:12,274 --> 01:25:14,025
We don't blame you.

1202
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:18,863
You're only doing yourjob.

1203
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:23,201
United Press International, today,
voted the Korean War

1204
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:27,288
-the top news story of 1951 .
-We're in the middle of putting.

1205
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:29,332
My God.

1206
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:33,920
All right. You men are under arrest.

1207
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:38,049
-l'll have you court-martialed.
-Come off it, Colonel.

1208
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:40,718
You won't have us. We have you.

1209
01:25:40,803 --> 01:25:45,223
Your boys blew this case
and we bailed you out.

1210
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:48,601
Now we are going to stay here
for one more day

1211
01:25:48,685 --> 01:25:51,479
and check out the Congressman's kid

1212
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:55,274
and get in some golf for ourselves.

1213
01:25:56,068 --> 01:25:58,986
lf that's okay with you, then we got a deal.

1214
01:25:59,488 --> 01:26:02,156
And if it isn't,
then we can always call Washington

1215
01:26:02,241 --> 01:26:04,951
and you tell them your story
and we'll tell them ours.

1216
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:06,327
lt's as simple as that.

1217
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:08,996
ln the meantime,
we are going to be at the pro shop,

1218
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:11,374
where we are going to have
a shower and a shave.

1219
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:15,336
lf you want to get in touch with us,
that is where we will be.

1220
01:26:20,634 --> 01:26:22,969
ls that a client? Excuse me.

1221
01:26:32,062 --> 01:26:34,772
-l've got sinus, too.
-Put some of that in that one.

1222
01:26:34,857 --> 01:26:36,899
-Put it in a plate.
-How about sake?

1223
01:26:40,112 --> 01:26:41,445
Excuse me.

1224
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:45,116
That really looks terrible.

1225
01:26:49,246 --> 01:26:51,163
-Okay.
-You try one.

1226
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:54,625
-Good?
-lt's terrible.

1227
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:03,342
Listen, l hate to do this to you, fellas,

1228
01:27:03,427 --> 01:27:06,304
but do you think you could take a minute
and look at a kid for me?

1229
01:27:06,388 --> 01:27:07,889
-Now?
-A kid?

1230
01:27:07,973 --> 01:27:09,724
Yeah.
We had a little carelessness around here,

1231
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:11,934
and the other day,
one of our girls presented us

1232
01:27:12,019 --> 01:27:14,812
with an eight pound
American-Japanese boy.

1233
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:19,483
Whatever we feed him,
it either comes right back up,

1234
01:27:19,568 --> 01:27:22,695
or he coughs and he turns blue.
He just has a hell of a time.

1235
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:25,239
We don't have to see him.
Just call that half-assed army hospital

1236
01:27:25,324 --> 01:27:27,617
and tell them to get some Lipiodol
ready for his stomach,

1237
01:27:27,701 --> 01:27:29,285
and we'll go over and take some x-rays.

1238
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:31,245
We can't get near that place.

1239
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:34,081
You know, with a civilian,
the colonel has a big thing about it,

1240
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:35,666
especially a native,
as he likes to call them.

1241
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:37,209
Then don't tell him
any more than necessary.

1242
01:27:37,294 --> 01:27:39,879
Tell him the pros from Dover
are on their way with an emergency.

1243
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:42,423
Tell him to get the OR ready,
get the kid asleep

1244
01:27:42,507 --> 01:27:45,676
and Trapper and l'll fix
his tracheoesophageal fistula.

1245
01:27:48,388 --> 01:27:50,932
Okay, Me Lai, put him down in here.

1246
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:53,601
Get him to sleep
as quick as you can, will you?

1247
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:56,103
-Where did this baby come from?
-Watch him.

1248
01:27:56,188 --> 01:27:58,564
-ls this what you got us up for?
-Yeah. That's what we got you up for.

1249
01:27:58,649 --> 01:28:00,024
Now, come on. Look, we stumbled on him.

1250
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:02,944
We don't want him, but we don't feel
we can back away from him.

1251
01:28:03,028 --> 01:28:05,446
All right.
This time, l will not be intimidated.

1252
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:07,239
l command that this
illegal and improper use

1253
01:28:07,324 --> 01:28:09,492
of army facilities cease immediately!

1254
01:28:09,576 --> 01:28:12,662
On this point, l stand as firm
as the Rock of Gibraltar.

1255
01:28:12,746 --> 01:28:14,622
And furthermore... You can't do...

1256
01:28:21,838 --> 01:28:23,464
This one is for West Point.

1257
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:25,883
What the Sam Hill's going on here?

1258
01:28:25,968 --> 01:28:30,054
That's what they all say.
What a filthy, disgusting, despicable...

1259
01:28:31,431 --> 01:28:35,142
There's no competition to the Painless
Pole, but it's pretty healthy, l think.

1260
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:37,687
You know, Colonel,
we caught you with your pants down.

1261
01:28:37,771 --> 01:28:40,856
-The men that are fighting...
-The men are fighting on our frontline!

1262
01:28:42,651 --> 01:28:44,443
Attention! Attention!

1263
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:48,406
Colonel Blake has secured for us
the Halls of Montezuma,

1264
01:28:48,907 --> 01:28:52,410
so big only the biggest of the screen
can bring it to you all.

1265
01:28:52,494 --> 01:28:56,789
Technicolor's. "Tell it to the Marines,
those lovable lugs with wonderful mugs,

1266
01:28:56,873 --> 01:28:58,874
"who we now love more than ever.

1267
01:28:58,959 --> 01:29:02,086
"Tell them they're still
the greatest guys in the world."

1268
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:05,423
Follow Lieutenant, Punchy,
Limey, Baby-Face, Doc,

1269
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:07,341
the Poet, Pretty Boy and Slattery

1270
01:29:07,426 --> 01:29:11,637
through some of the most
interesting war films yet created.

1271
01:29:13,849 --> 01:29:15,766
Due to a possible camp infection,

1272
01:29:15,851 --> 01:29:19,603
Arlene Chu's Hollywood Grill
is now off limits. That is all.

1273
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:23,816
-Could l have some longer needles?
-Get this sponge out of the way.

1274
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:29,447
Cut down on the back, will you?
Hey, Dago.

1275
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:34,618
-Hi. Did you have a nice time in Japan?
-Yeah, l screwed a kabuki dancer.

1276
01:29:37,247 --> 01:29:39,540
-Let me have the long-fingers.
-lt's okay for a while.

1277
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:42,334
-Yeah, but l can't stop this bleeding.
-Okay.

1278
01:29:42,419 --> 01:29:44,170
Keeping the blood internal.

1279
01:29:44,254 --> 01:29:47,298
-How's the intake, Painless?
-Normal.

1280
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:48,549
Clamps down there.

1281
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:52,928
-l'm here if you need me, Henry.
-l can't talk to you now, padre.

1282
01:29:53,013 --> 01:29:55,890
No, l mean, he's going to be all right,
isn't he?

1283
01:29:55,974 --> 01:29:58,559
-He's going to be fine.
-Good.

1284
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:00,853
Does anybody else need help?

1285
01:30:02,606 --> 01:30:03,647
Ask around.

1286
01:30:09,112 --> 01:30:11,489
What's he got the flaps down for?

1287
01:30:15,702 --> 01:30:19,413
-Duke. Come on, Duke. Open up.
-What? No, l don't want any.

1288
01:30:19,498 --> 01:30:21,749
Hey, Duke. Come on. Open up, man.

1289
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:23,334
Who is it?

1290
01:30:29,007 --> 01:30:30,341
What the hell you doing back here?

1291
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:32,843
Come on. We've been working for hours.
Will you open up?

1292
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:35,554
Wait a minute. l'll be right with you.

1293
01:30:45,482 --> 01:30:47,691
-Hi, Hot Lips.
-You miss us?

1294
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:53,072
-Shame, shame on you
-Shame, shame on you

1295
01:30:56,034 --> 01:30:57,034
Well...

1296
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:02,998
-Radar.
-Yes, sir.

1297
01:31:04,793 --> 01:31:06,460
Hold this, please.

1298
01:31:11,007 --> 01:31:11,966
Colonel Blake.

1299
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:14,677
Henry? Yeah. Charlie here. Yeah.

1300
01:31:14,761 --> 01:31:16,554
l've got news for you.

1301
01:31:16,638 --> 01:31:19,431
You were so concerned
about the battle for Old Baldy.

1302
01:31:19,808 --> 01:31:23,727
-Well, it's all over.
-That's great news, General. Who won?

1303
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:30,568
By the way, l have a report here, Henry,
from your chief nurse Major O'Houlihan.

1304
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:35,156
She makes some accusations, Henry,
I find pretty hard to believe.

1305
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:38,117
Don't believe them, then.
Thank you, General. Goodbye.

1306
01:31:38,201 --> 01:31:39,451
Yeah... What?

1307
01:31:39,911 --> 01:31:42,580
-Thank you, Radar.
-You're welcome, sir.

1308
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:50,171
Attention. Attention. Friday night's movie
wiII be The Glory Brigade.

1309
01:31:50,255 --> 01:31:53,048
Rock 'em, sock 'em, kisses you never got.

1310
01:31:53,592 --> 01:31:58,304
It's Uncle Sam's combat engineers
charging side by side with Greeks, Anzacs,

1311
01:31:58,805 --> 01:32:02,850
showing the world a new way to fight,
as they use bulldozers like bazookas,

1312
01:32:02,934 --> 01:32:05,686
bayonets like bazookas... Bullets.

1313
01:32:06,062 --> 01:32:08,647
Starring Victor Mature. That is all.

1314
01:32:09,191 --> 01:32:10,774
l'll be with Colonel Blake.

1315
01:32:11,610 --> 01:32:14,069
Check this place out.
See what the nurses are like, huh?

1316
01:32:14,154 --> 01:32:15,613
Right, sir.

1317
01:32:17,032 --> 01:32:19,909
-4077th Mobile Army Surgical...
-Yeah, yeah.

1318
01:32:19,993 --> 01:32:22,786
-Sir, do you know where...
-Yes, l know where he is.

1319
01:32:22,871 --> 01:32:25,748
All right.

1320
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:29,418
-Thank you.
-Look, Charlie,

1321
01:32:29,961 --> 01:32:31,253
you can't blame Henry

1322
01:32:31,338 --> 01:32:34,548
because Hot Lips Houlihan
can't stand her name.

1323
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:37,551
You know, she's just a lady, though.
What the hell?

1324
01:32:37,636 --> 01:32:39,637
Come on, for crying out loud.

1325
01:32:39,721 --> 01:32:42,223
She's regular army.
She's a fanatic about ritual.

1326
01:32:42,307 --> 01:32:44,934
She won't even let us play football.

1327
01:32:45,018 --> 01:32:48,103
-Football?
-Gentlemen. She's all lined up, Charlie.

1328
01:32:48,188 --> 01:32:51,273
Yeah. l didn't know
you had a football team.

1329
01:32:51,358 --> 01:32:53,859
lt's pretty much in the planning stage.

1330
01:32:53,944 --> 01:32:56,237
No, no, we have a very fine football team.

1331
01:32:56,321 --> 01:33:00,950
Yeah? Well, we had a team
back with the 325th Evac last year.

1332
01:33:01,034 --> 01:33:04,787
-And what a team that was.
-Yeah. l coached the boys myself.

1333
01:33:05,914 --> 01:33:08,832
-He's the finest coach in the Far East.
-Yeah.

1334
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:11,252
We're now trying to work out
a schedule of the outfits

1335
01:33:11,336 --> 01:33:12,962
that we're going to play this year.

1336
01:33:13,046 --> 01:33:17,424
Of course, we, you know, throw
a little money into a pot and make bets.

1337
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:21,262
How much money
do you put into your pot?

1338
01:33:21,346 --> 01:33:24,848
-$5,000, $6,000.
-$5,000!

1339
01:33:25,392 --> 01:33:28,602
Look, you know, l don't think we're
in the sort of league that you're in.

1340
01:33:28,687 --> 01:33:32,398
Well, l'm sure we can find a date
when we can play your team.

1341
01:33:32,482 --> 01:33:36,610
-lt can be arranged.
-Yeah. l think l'll talk this over with Henry.

1342
01:33:36,695 --> 01:33:38,696
Thanks, boys. Thanks for the drink.

1343
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:41,657
-Thank you.
-What the hell you...

1344
01:33:41,741 --> 01:33:45,077
Sir, ever since the dark days
before Pearl Harbor,

1345
01:33:45,161 --> 01:33:46,870
l've been proud to wear this uniform.

1346
01:33:46,955 --> 01:33:48,914
-What the hell is this?
-A helicopter.

1347
01:33:48,999 --> 01:33:52,293
Hawkeye, that man has five times
the manpower to draw on than we do.

1348
01:33:52,377 --> 01:33:55,504
Sure, so we get ourselves a ringer, right?

1349
01:33:55,588 --> 01:34:00,426
We get Henry to apply, make a specific
application for a neurosurgeon.

1350
01:34:00,510 --> 01:34:04,096
He asks for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.

1351
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:08,809
-Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones?
-He's... Who is Oliver Harmon Jones?

1352
01:34:08,893 --> 01:34:12,396
He is better known as Spearchucker Jones.

1353
01:34:13,523 --> 01:34:15,149
-He's a good ballplayer.
-Yes!

1354
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:17,693
He's a negro boy,
played with the 49ers, didn't he?

1355
01:34:17,777 --> 01:34:18,902
-Sure.
-Yeah. Sure, l remember.

1356
01:34:18,987 --> 01:34:20,029
He's good. He's good.

1357
01:34:20,405 --> 01:34:22,656
Henry, if we had closer relations,

1358
01:34:22,741 --> 01:34:25,659
we wouldn't have
this misunderstanding, right?

1359
01:34:25,744 --> 01:34:30,122
Now, that's where a football game
would help between your outfit and mine.

1360
01:34:30,206 --> 01:34:31,165
-A football game?
-Yeah, yeah.

1361
01:34:31,249 --> 01:34:35,252
We put up a few bets,
$5,000 maybe, and have a little fun.

1362
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:39,006
Special Services in Tokyo says
it's one of the best gimmicks we've got

1363
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:41,675
to keep the American way of life
going here in Asia.

1364
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:44,094
-Betting?
-No. Football.

1365
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:46,347
But what about Major O'Houlihan?

1366
01:34:46,431 --> 01:34:49,099
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.

1367
01:34:49,184 --> 01:34:50,517
-Gee, l don't know...
-lt's a helicopter, General.

1368
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:52,811
l know it's a helicopter.

1369
01:34:52,896 --> 01:34:54,897
You know what?
You guys have one problem.

1370
01:34:54,981 --> 01:34:56,357
l just wondered about the social problem,
you know.

1371
01:34:56,441 --> 01:35:00,444
l mean, he's the only Negro officer
in the whole camp, you know.

1372
01:35:00,945 --> 01:35:04,656
We got a problem, then
we'll stick him in here with us, baby boy.

1373
01:35:06,201 --> 01:35:09,453
-You're serious, ain't you? You'd do that.
-Sure, l'm serious. Yeah.

1374
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:13,374
lt's enough for me to have to put up
with you two Yankees,

1375
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:15,626
but l'm, you know, that's...

1376
01:35:18,463 --> 01:35:22,257
Because of his wife, was that why?
Or was it a religious problem?

1377
01:35:22,342 --> 01:35:24,968
-lt was a conditioning problem.
-Why do they call you Spearchucker?

1378
01:35:25,053 --> 01:35:27,179
l used to throw the javelin.

1379
01:35:33,812 --> 01:35:37,022
All right, men, we're not here
to sell lemonade. We're here to practice.

1380
01:35:37,107 --> 01:35:40,025
But first l'd like to
officially welcome Spearchucker.

1381
01:35:40,110 --> 01:35:42,236
-ls it all right to call you that?
-Call me whatever you want to.

1382
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,780
Good. Well, l just want you to know
that we're all the same here

1383
01:35:44,864 --> 01:35:47,783
on the playing field, officers and men alike.

1384
01:35:47,867 --> 01:35:51,578
Now, we're going to begin
with the three basic principles.

1385
01:35:51,663 --> 01:35:54,706
Organization, discipline and teamwork.

1386
01:35:54,791 --> 01:35:55,833
-Now...
-Pardon me.

1387
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:59,420
-Do you mind if we limber up first?
-That's a good idea. You organize that.

1388
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:06,468
Move that line, hey! Hold that line, hey!

1389
01:36:06,553 --> 01:36:10,681
All right, Seidman, keep on
pushing that... Whatever you call it.

1390
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:14,893
That's good. All right, Hot Lips,
keep their arms and limbs moving there.

1391
01:36:17,313 --> 01:36:21,400
Radar, you're a coach.
You're not a corporal. You're a coach,

1392
01:36:21,484 --> 01:36:23,152
so keep them going through there.

1393
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:24,736
Good, Hot Lips.

1394
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:27,614
All right, Seidman, give them five.

1395
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:29,616
All right, men, take five.

1396
01:36:29,701 --> 01:36:31,285
Spearchucker.

1397
01:36:36,207 --> 01:36:38,208
Well, we look pretty lousy, don't we?

1398
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:40,252
Well, for college players
that have been out of training

1399
01:36:40,336 --> 01:36:42,379
for seven or eight years,
yeah, you look pretty lousy.

1400
01:36:42,464 --> 01:36:44,631
Listen, l got an idea
how we can make some money.

1401
01:36:44,716 --> 01:36:46,216
We leave him out
of the first half of the game.

1402
01:36:46,301 --> 01:36:49,803
We bet half our money.
They roll up some points, okay?

1403
01:36:49,888 --> 01:36:52,473
Second half of the game, we stick him in.
We get odds from them.

1404
01:36:52,557 --> 01:36:54,766
We bet the other half of the money.
We clean up.

1405
01:36:54,851 --> 01:36:57,644
-That's very good thinking, Captain.
-Yeah. lt sounds good to me.

1406
01:36:57,729 --> 01:37:01,148
And l had another idea.
l think we should have some plays.

1407
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:04,067
You know, usually in football,
you have some organized plays.

1408
01:37:04,152 --> 01:37:07,571
-Well, if you don't mind, l took the liberty.
-You have.

1409
01:37:07,655 --> 01:37:10,324
-l drew up about seven or eight plays.
-These are good.

1410
01:37:10,408 --> 01:37:12,242
l think that's about all
this bunch can handle.

1411
01:37:12,327 --> 01:37:16,079
Very good. Yes. Very, very good.

1412
01:37:17,624 --> 01:37:18,790
What are these little arrows?

1413
01:37:56,621 --> 01:37:58,413
-Right into his hands.
-Right on!

1414
01:38:15,265 --> 01:38:18,058
-Well, it's only six points.
-Six points.

1415
01:38:25,817 --> 01:38:27,401
-Well, it's only one point.
-One point!

1416
01:38:27,485 --> 01:38:29,903
Who's that number one? That man
runs like a rabbit. We can't stop him.

1417
01:38:29,988 --> 01:38:31,989
Yeah. l remember him from the pros.
They call him Super Bug.

1418
01:38:32,073 --> 01:38:33,574
He had one year with the Rams
before the army got him.

1419
01:38:33,658 --> 01:38:36,702
-We can't do anything with him in there.
-Hey, listen. You got to come in now.

1420
01:38:36,786 --> 01:38:37,869
-We can't wait till the second half.
-No, no.

1421
01:38:37,954 --> 01:38:39,079
We got to stick to our strategy,

1422
01:38:39,163 --> 01:38:41,582
but the first thing you guys have to do
is get him out of the ballgame.

1423
01:38:41,666 --> 01:38:43,417
Hey, Davidson! Here.

1424
01:38:44,043 --> 01:38:48,130
Let's ease up just a little bit.
We don't want the score too lopsided.

1425
01:38:54,679 --> 01:38:56,179
He caught it!

1426
01:38:58,683 --> 01:39:00,601
-Get him!
-Get him!

1427
01:39:05,857 --> 01:39:07,190
-Go get him!
-Go get him!

1428
01:39:09,694 --> 01:39:10,819
Who's he giving it to?

1429
01:39:10,903 --> 01:39:14,740
-lsn't that Corporal Judson with the ball?
-Judson's a lineman. Judson can't run!

1430
01:39:14,824 --> 01:39:16,575
He's loose. He's loose.

1431
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:24,291
For crying out loud, Judson,
what're you doing?

1432
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:26,793
-Duke, you threw me that damn ball.
-Come on, let's get in a huddle.

1433
01:39:26,878 --> 01:39:28,629
What the hell?
You had the whole field open!

1434
01:39:28,713 --> 01:39:30,297
Why'd you go and fall down for?

1435
01:39:30,381 --> 01:39:32,215
l'm no goddamn runner. l'm a lineman.

1436
01:39:35,053 --> 01:39:37,429
We're going to really clean up today.

1437
01:39:37,513 --> 01:39:39,181
Hut one, hut two!

1438
01:39:49,359 --> 01:39:52,694
-lt's only two points.
-Two points.

1439
01:39:52,779 --> 01:39:55,155
What the hell you think you are,
a cannon?

1440
01:39:55,239 --> 01:39:56,531
What kind of a snap was that?

1441
01:39:56,616 --> 01:39:59,618
We got a lot of money on this game.
This is embarrassing, man.

1442
01:39:59,702 --> 01:40:02,913
-Oh, go, we want some dough!
-Oh, go, we want some dough!

1443
01:40:08,378 --> 01:40:10,212
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

1444
01:40:12,048 --> 01:40:14,675
-What happens now?
-We get a free kick.

1445
01:40:14,759 --> 01:40:17,177
A free kick! Girls!

1446
01:40:17,261 --> 01:40:20,430
-Hit that ball! Kick that ball!
-Hit that ball! Kick that ball!

1447
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:49,918
-Another six points.
-Another six points.

1448
01:40:53,548 --> 01:40:56,133
Look, look, he's hurt.

1449
01:40:56,217 --> 01:40:58,218
He's leaving the game!

1450
01:40:58,302 --> 01:41:05,892
He's hurt! He's hurt!
He's leaving the game! He's hurt!

1451
01:41:05,977 --> 01:41:08,311
What the hell's the matter with you?
Smith!

1452
01:41:08,396 --> 01:41:12,733
-Goddamn bastards pulled something.
-Hey, Coach, did l break my 9 in 400?

1453
01:41:12,817 --> 01:41:15,694
400! This is not a track meet.
This is a football game.

1454
01:41:15,778 --> 01:41:17,904
What the hell do you think l pay you for?

1455
01:41:17,989 --> 01:41:20,240
Get him up. Walk him around.
Do something.

1456
01:41:20,324 --> 01:41:25,162
-l think l'll run the 440.
-440! This is a football game, God damn it!

1457
01:41:32,044 --> 01:41:34,671
All right, you guys,
get in there and kill them!

1458
01:41:46,976 --> 01:41:48,852
All right, bub, your fucking head
is coming right off.

1459
01:41:59,822 --> 01:42:02,199
-l'm ready, Coach. Ready, Coach.
-Ready for what?

1460
01:42:02,283 --> 01:42:06,119
-l'm in the broad jump, Coach.
-Get him back on the bench. Broad jump!

1461
01:42:06,204 --> 01:42:09,456
-Still 1 6-0.
-1 6-0.

1462
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:12,918
Well, that's not bad. 1 6-0 in the first half.

1463
01:42:13,002 --> 01:42:15,337
l guess l have to give them
the old Knute Rockne at half-time.

1464
01:42:15,421 --> 01:42:17,464
-About time for the gun.
-Right.

1465
01:42:22,053 --> 01:42:23,887
Hurts like a mother,
but how are we gonna score...

1466
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:28,266
Men, ever since the dark days
before Pearl Harbor,

1467
01:42:28,351 --> 01:42:30,560
-l've been proud to wear this uniform.
-Boone, you got a towel?

1468
01:42:30,645 --> 01:42:33,063
-Henry, have you pressed the bets yet?
-Today we are wearing...

1469
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:34,815
Henry, have you pressed
the bets yet, babe?

1470
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:36,691
-The bets, the bets!
-Henry, press the bets, man.

1471
01:42:37,068 --> 01:42:38,610
Finish, finish the half-time speech.

1472
01:42:39,612 --> 01:42:42,781
Hit them with a mortar!
Kick them off the hill!

1473
01:42:42,865 --> 01:42:46,201
-Mash them! Smash them! Kill! Kill! Kill!
-Mash them! Smash them! Kill! Kill! Kill!

1474
01:42:46,285 --> 01:42:50,080
Hot Lips! There's a time
and a place for everything, damn it!

1475
01:42:51,207 --> 01:42:53,834
-Right. Bo-bo.
-Bo! Bo!

1476
01:42:53,918 --> 01:42:56,294
Come on, Smitty. Come on, boy.

1477
01:42:58,548 --> 01:43:00,173
-What's the matter with him?
-What's the matter with him?

1478
01:43:00,258 --> 01:43:03,260
Hell, you ought to know.
You guys pulled something out there.

1479
01:43:03,344 --> 01:43:05,178
Well, l guess you don't
want to double the bet.

1480
01:43:05,263 --> 01:43:06,805
The hell l don't.

1481
01:43:06,889 --> 01:43:09,558
We were beating you without him,
and we'll go on beating you.

1482
01:43:09,642 --> 01:43:11,184
Are you prepared
to back that up with odds?

1483
01:43:11,269 --> 01:43:14,062
Damn right. Three to one. Double the bet.

1484
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:29,369
Who's that 24? Who is he?

1485
01:43:32,290 --> 01:43:34,040
Stop him! Stop him!

1486
01:43:35,126 --> 01:43:39,796
Stop him! Stop him! Who is that guy?
He wasn't in the game in the first half.

1487
01:43:39,881 --> 01:43:41,298
Stop him!

1488
01:43:51,392 --> 01:43:53,894
-That's Spearchucker Jones.
-Spearchucker who?

1489
01:43:53,978 --> 01:43:56,062
He played with San Francisco
before he got drafted.

1490
01:43:56,147 --> 01:43:58,106
Boy, he's going to be tough to stop, too.

1491
01:43:58,816 --> 01:44:00,901
Henry, you brought in a ringer, did you?

1492
01:44:00,985 --> 01:44:05,947
-Radar, what's the general trying to say?
-Didn't bring him in the first half, did you?

1493
01:44:06,032 --> 01:44:10,285
He's just been informed
as to the identity of our Spearchucker.

1494
01:44:10,369 --> 01:44:12,287
His ringer's spotted our ringer.

1495
01:44:12,371 --> 01:44:15,165
How do you like them apples, Charlie?

1496
01:44:15,249 --> 01:44:19,502
-You can't trust anybody.
-Now watch him make the extra point.

1497
01:44:25,676 --> 01:44:26,968
lsn't that illegal?

1498
01:45:12,390 --> 01:45:16,977
What kind of team is it?
They're falling all around like dead flies!

1499
01:45:26,028 --> 01:45:30,699
-Look! A red flag! We've got a red flag!
-Hot Lips!

1500
01:45:32,910 --> 01:45:34,411
lt's a penalty, you blithering idiots.

1501
01:45:42,128 --> 01:45:46,339
Judson, get off of him.
You'll be thrown out of the game.

1502
01:45:46,424 --> 01:45:48,466
Judson, kill him!

1503
01:45:55,349 --> 01:45:59,185
What's wrong with you, huh?
We're here to play football, not fight!

1504
01:46:02,064 --> 01:46:05,817
-Bastard 88 called me a coon.
-Called you a what?

1505
01:46:07,111 --> 01:46:08,361
Coon.

1506
01:46:09,363 --> 01:46:12,657
Okay, that's an old pro trick
to get you thrown out of the ballgame.

1507
01:46:13,242 --> 01:46:15,201
Why don't you do the same thing to him?

1508
01:46:15,286 --> 01:46:16,870
What, call him a coon?

1509
01:46:16,954 --> 01:46:19,164
No, no, the boys in camp
used to talk about his sister.

1510
01:46:19,248 --> 01:46:21,332
Her name was Gladys. Use it!

1511
01:46:23,169 --> 01:46:25,378
-Yeah.
-All right, all right.

1512
01:46:43,981 --> 01:46:46,649
What the hell are you doing,
for God's sake?

1513
01:46:47,401 --> 01:46:48,818
What's the matter here?

1514
01:46:49,695 --> 01:46:51,112
They're taking him out.

1515
01:46:58,704 --> 01:47:03,666
-69 is divine! 69 is divine!
-69 is divine! 69 is divine!

1516
01:47:03,751 --> 01:47:08,463
There you go, Charlie.
Another side of beef for your butcher shop.

1517
01:47:08,547 --> 01:47:12,383
Let's get the ball and really go!
Hey, hey! Ho, ho!

1518
01:47:12,468 --> 01:47:15,595
-Who's the brunette? She a new one?
-Yeah, l just had her shipped in.

1519
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:18,848
Yeah. Not bad.
Kill them! Kill them, God damn it!

1520
01:47:23,437 --> 01:47:25,772
My God! They've shot him!

1521
01:47:25,856 --> 01:47:29,651
Hot Lips, you incredible nincompoop.
lt's the end of the quarter.

1522
01:47:29,735 --> 01:47:33,404
What did l make you a major for?
For a team like that?

1523
01:47:33,489 --> 01:47:34,656
l did the best l could, Charlie.

1524
01:47:34,740 --> 01:47:36,199
l didn't know
they were going to bring in a ringer.

1525
01:47:36,283 --> 01:47:37,575
l ought to put you in there
and let them kill you,

1526
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:38,701
is what l ought to do.

1527
01:47:38,786 --> 01:47:40,328
What about my knee, Charlie?
Remember my knee.

1528
01:47:40,412 --> 01:47:44,082
You better get on your goddamn knee
and start praying. Trick knee, my ass.

1529
01:48:16,365 --> 01:48:17,824
My God!

1530
01:48:28,252 --> 01:48:29,919
-How's that?
-Did you see that?

1531
01:48:30,004 --> 01:48:33,214
Get the hell back there. Get back there.

1532
01:48:57,031 --> 01:49:00,491
Well, looks like we may make it.
Seconds to go.

1533
01:49:00,576 --> 01:49:02,744
Okay, fellas,
we don't have very much time left.

1534
01:49:02,828 --> 01:49:03,953
Now, l just checked with the ref.

1535
01:49:04,038 --> 01:49:06,873
l got a special play l want to run with,
a center eligible play.

1536
01:49:06,957 --> 01:49:10,376
We line up with everybody to the right
of the center except Hawkeye,

1537
01:49:10,461 --> 01:49:13,379
who drops back one yard
just before the snap of the ball.

1538
01:49:13,464 --> 01:49:14,881
Now, that makes you the semi-eligible,

1539
01:49:14,965 --> 01:49:18,551
but all you have to do is take the ball
right back from Trapper between your legs

1540
01:49:18,636 --> 01:49:23,556
and hide it under your belly
and walk toward their goal. All right?

1541
01:49:23,641 --> 01:49:24,766
Trapper.

1542
01:49:26,185 --> 01:49:27,185
We got it.

1543
01:49:27,311 --> 01:49:30,897
All right. This is only one time. $5,000.

1544
01:49:30,981 --> 01:49:32,732
-Worth a try.
-lt'd be a miracle.

1545
01:49:32,816 --> 01:49:33,816
l'm short one.

1546
01:49:33,901 --> 01:49:35,610
-What do you say? What do you say?
-Let's do it now!

1547
01:49:35,694 --> 01:49:36,819
Ready, Hawk?

1548
01:49:36,904 --> 01:49:37,904
Ready!

1549
01:49:39,615 --> 01:49:40,657
Set!

1550
01:49:53,712 --> 01:49:56,422
-What are you doing? Get back!
-l got the ball!

1551
01:49:56,507 --> 01:49:57,715
Run with it!

1552
01:51:28,140 --> 01:51:30,183
-Two dollars.
-Two dollars.

1553
01:51:34,104 --> 01:51:35,605
Four dollars.

1554
01:51:36,607 --> 01:51:38,816
Out. l fold.

1555
01:51:39,068 --> 01:51:41,694
Raise you two more. You raise his two?

1556
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:44,947
Raise you another two.

1557
01:51:46,033 --> 01:51:49,035
-l have an Oklahoma.
-Oh, God!

1558
01:51:52,456 --> 01:51:54,207
-What is that?
-Oklahoma. lt's a pair of eights,

1559
01:51:54,291 --> 01:51:56,626
-a ten of spades, a deuce, and a five.
-You win!

1560
01:51:56,710 --> 01:51:58,544
What are you talking about?
What do you have?

1561
01:51:58,629 --> 01:51:59,796
Tokyo.

1562
01:52:00,297 --> 01:52:03,633
The United States Armed Forces
Radio is on the air.

1563
01:52:37,167 --> 01:52:39,168
Duke? You busy?

1564
01:52:41,255 --> 01:52:45,007
-What is it?
-Henry's got our orders. We can go home.

1565
01:52:57,563 --> 01:52:58,729
Right now?

1566
01:52:59,273 --> 01:53:01,691
Any time. Whenever we want.

1567
01:53:01,775 --> 01:53:04,360
Do you mind
if we get out of this guy's brain first?

1568
01:53:09,199 --> 01:53:12,827
Can't you sew this thing up?
You got that vessel under control.

1569
01:53:14,705 --> 01:53:15,705
Haven't you?

1570
01:53:16,707 --> 01:53:19,667
l want to make sure the oozing
is completely checked before l close up.

1571
01:53:19,751 --> 01:53:21,210
Damn perfectionist.

1572
01:53:23,464 --> 01:53:25,047
Yeah, well, l'm...

1573
01:53:27,134 --> 01:53:28,134
l'll see you.

1574
01:53:32,723 --> 01:53:33,806
Five goddamn months,

1575
01:53:33,891 --> 01:53:37,560
and they don't even give a guy
time off for good behavior.

1576
01:53:37,644 --> 01:53:40,605
Hey, hey, man, see you around.

1577
01:53:40,689 --> 01:53:42,190
lt's possible.

1578
01:53:43,025 --> 01:53:44,650
Take care of the squirrels.

1579
01:53:51,033 --> 01:53:52,658
So long, Pup-Pup.

1580
01:53:55,746 --> 01:53:56,996
Will you go, for Christ's sakes?

1581
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:59,999
Will you go before they change their mind?
Get out of here!

1582
01:54:00,083 --> 01:54:02,960
"O Lord God,

Did Hawkeye steal that jeep?

1603
