1
00:00:04,088 --> 00:00:05,923
<i>In the name of Allah, the merciful.</i>

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,676
<i>All praises due to Allah,
Lord of all worlds.</i>

3
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:10,845
<i>The one God to whom praise
is due forever.</i>

4
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:13,806
<i>The one who came to us in the person
of Fard Muhammad...</i>

5
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:16,767
<i>...and raised up the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad. Amen.</i>

6
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,185
<i>Amen.</i>

7
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:22,273
<i>- How do you feel?</i>
<i>- Fine, sir!</i>

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,608
<i>- Who do we want to hear?</i>
<i>- Malcolm X!</i>

9
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:26,068
<i>Are we gonna bring him on?</i>

10
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:28,904
<i>Yes, we gonna bring him on.</i>

11
00:00:29,113 --> 00:00:31,824
<i>Let us hear from our minister,
Mr. Malcolm X!</i>

12
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:34,160
<i>Let us bring him on with
a round of applause.</i>

13
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,209
<i>Brothers and sisters.</i>

14
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:45,713
<i>I'm here to tell you that
I charge the white man.</i>

15
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:49,633
<i>I charge the white man with being
the greatest murderer on earth.</i>

16
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:54,096
<i>I charge the white man with being
the greatest kidnapper on earth.</i>

17
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:57,558
<i>There's no place in this world
that that man can go...</i>

18
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:01,270
<i>...and say he created peace
and harmony. Everywhere he's gone...</i>

19
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:02,938
<i>...he's created havoc.</i>

20
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:06,150
<i>Everywhere he's gone,
he's created destruction.</i>

21
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:10,613
<i>So I charge him with being
the greatest kidnapper on this earth!</i>

22
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,949
<i>I charge him with being the greatest
murderer on this earth!</i>

23
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:18,454
<i>I charge him with being the greatest
robber and enslaver on this earth!</i>

24
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,456
<i>I charge the white man...</i>

25
00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:23,292
<i>...with being the greatest swine-eater
on this earth!</i>

26
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:25,002
<i>The greatest drunkard on this earth!</i>

27
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:27,463
<i>He can't deny the charges.</i>

28
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,050
<i>You can't deny the charges!
We're the living proof of those charges!</i>

29
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,011
<i>You and I are the proof.</i>

30
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:38,140
<i>You're not an American.
You are the victim of America!</i>

31
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:41,185
<i>You didn't have a choice coming here.
He didn't say:</i>

32
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:45,189
<i>"Black man, black woman, come over
and help me build America."</i>

33
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:47,691
<i>He said, "Nigger, get in the boat.</i>

34
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:51,320
<i>I'm taking you over there to help me
build America."</i>

35
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:55,199
<i>Being born here
does not make you an American.</i>

36
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:58,160
<i>I am not an American,
you are not American.</i>

37
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:00,287
<i>You're one
of the 22 million black people...</i>

38
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,960
<i>...who are victims of America.
You and I, we've never seen democracy.</i>

39
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,881
<i>There's no democracy in the fields
of Georgia. No democracy down there.</i>

40
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:16,679
<i>We didn't see any democracy in Harlem,
Brooklyn, Detroit, Chicago.</i>

41
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:20,266
<i>Ain't no democracy there.
We've never seen democracy.</i>

42
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,769
<i>All we've seen is hypocrisy.</i>

43
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,481
<i>We don't see any American dream.</i>

44
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:31,277
<i>We've experienced only
the American nightmare.</i>

45
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:38,075
<i>We want Malcolm X! We want Malcolm X!</i>

46
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,799
See that spot? Get it. The spot!

47
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:38,219
All right, that's it.

48
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,848
- Thanks.
- Come on.

49
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,344
Hey, Cholly!

50
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:24,306
Where'd you get that number you hit on?
Was it your girl's address?

51
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:28,686
No, my grandma gave me that number
in my dreams. Straight!

52
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:30,396
3-8-4.

53
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,523
You said Sassy Frassy gave you--

54
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,899
That woman quit me.

55
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:38,112
After I hit the number,
that woman was no good to me at all.

56
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,197
- What happened?
- She said I was cheap...

57
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:42,658
...because I wouldn't cop her
a diamond ring.

58
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:47,079
- And on top of that, had the indignation...
- Whoo.

59
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:50,249
...to call me, of all people,
Good-time Cholly...

60
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,253
- ...a cheap, black son of a bitch.
- Sassy Frassy?

61
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,963
Where's homeboy?

62
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,631
- Hey, Little.
- Yeah?

63
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,050
Your man out here waiting on you.

64
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:04,888
- There he is.
- Hey.

65
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,725
Fixing to get that first conk laid on,
eh, homeboy?

66
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,019
Be hot like hell. Ha-ha-ha.

67
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,312
Don't be scared, son.

68
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,231
You ain't got nothing to worry about.

69
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:17,026
You in the hands of an expert.

70
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:21,530
My hair was just like yours.
Look what he did for me.

71
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,741
Ha-ha-ha!
- Heckle and Jeckle...

72
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,744
...don't scare the man no more than
he's scared already.

73
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:30,039
- Get his forehead and eyebrows.
- Who's doing this?

74
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,708
- You all heard that!
- You all heard that. Ha-ha-ha.

75
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:36,920
Pull my coat if it stings.
This shit can burn a hole through cement.

76
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,464
Hold tight.

77
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,091
I thought you said this would sting, Shorty.

78
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,218
Ha, ha. This ain't nothing.

79
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,262
- Feel good, don't it?
- Real good?

80
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:48,349
- Yeah, it's all right.
- You'll feel better in a minute.

81
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,726
It is heating up a bit.

82
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,063
- It's starting to heat up.
- It's all right.

83
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,731
Feeling better, ain't it? Ha, ha.

84
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,525
- Just hold on.
- I'm holding, but it's heating.

85
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,694
- Gotta make it straight.
- All right.

86
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,613
That's what he told me too.

87
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,325
I gotta get this out now.
It's starting--

88
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:08,118
Uh-oh. Uh-oh!

89
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,330
- Hold on.
- I'm holding, I'm holding.

90
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:13,707
- Hold on.
- I'm holding on, man!

91
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,251
Give me a hand!
Help me out! Hold him!

92
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,962
- Shorty!
- We're going to the sink!

93
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:20,964
I got to get up! I got to get up!

94
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,633
- Cool it!
- Put water on it!

95
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,801
More water!

96
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,053
You're getting it in my eye!

97
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,473
- How's it feel?
- Like there's no skin on my head!

98
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,891
If you can talk, it's out.

99
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,519
- How does it look?
- Can't tell yet.

100
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,397
It's straight, right?
I ain't doing this again.

101
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:38,190
Let me dry it.

102
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,070
I can tell it's laying down.

103
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,658
- Don't take it off yet.
- All right.

104
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:51,662
<i>That's the thing
to do. Come on in here and get through.</i>

105
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:55,082
<i>A money-maker and a heart-breaker
every step of the way.</i>

106
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,709
<i>You gonna flip.
That's right, watch your lip.</i>

107
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,337
Whoo-ooh.

108
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,676
Looks white, don't it?

109
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:06,885
All right!

110
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,346
Well, all root!

111
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:10,514
All reet!

112
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:18,814
Swing.

113
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,285
Hit the brim with the left.

114
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,999
Hey, girls.

115
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,294
Sweet thing, ha, ha.

116
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,223
<i>When my mother was pregnant with me...</i>

117
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:58,228
<i>...a party of Klansmen surrounded
our house in Omaha, Nebraska.</i>

118
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:02,065
<i>They brandished guns and shouted
for my father to come out.</i>

119
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,735
We know you're in there, come out!

120
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,571
<i>My pregnant mother went to the door...</i>

121
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,907
<i>...and said that my father
was in Milwaukee, preaching.</i>

122
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,158
He's in Milwaukee.

123
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,702
<i>These hooded men
said that good white Christians...</i>

124
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:17,498
<i>...would not stand for his troublemaking
and to get out of town.</i>

125
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,129
It's all right.

126
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,435
<i>They broke every window
with their rifle butts...</i>

127
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:40,479
<i>...before riding off into the night.</i>

128
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:46,109
<i>They rode off into the moonlight on their
horses as suddenly as they had come.</i>

129
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:51,448
<i>My father was not a frightened Negro,
as most were and many still are today.</i>

130
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,951
<i>He was 6' 4", a very strong man.</i>

131
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,953
<i>He believed, as did Marcus Garvey...</i>

132
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,455
<i>...that freedom, independence
and self-respect...</i>

133
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:00,791
<i>...couldn't be achieved
by Negroes in America.</i>

134
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,963
--the object of building up for themselves
a great nation in Africa.

135
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,172
<i>Therefore...</i>

136
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,884
<i>...black men should leave America
and return to their land of origin.</i>

137
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,803
--to his original home, Africa.

138
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,639
<i>My father dedicated his life to his beliefs...</i>

139
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:18,600
<i>...because four of his six brothers
died violently.</i>

140
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,728
<i>Three killed by white men,
and one lynched.</i>

141
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:24,231
<i>There were nine children in our family.</i>

142
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:28,402
<i>My mother was a proud woman,
an educated woman, a strong woman.</i>

143
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:33,532
<i>She was fair-skinned because her mother
was raped by a white man.</i>

144
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,411
<i>One reason she married my father
was because he was so black.</i>

145
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,955
<i>She hated her complexion,
the white blood in her body...</i>

146
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:42,082
<i>...and she wanted her children
to have some color.</i>

147
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:46,753
<i>In fact, I think this had a profound effect on
me back then and on most Negroes today.</i>

148
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,963
Shh.

149
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,840
<i>Because so many of our sisters...</i>

150
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:52,718
<i>...have been raped
or violated by the white man...</i>

151
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:56,847
<i>...black men can't wait to get their
hands on the white man's prize:</i>

152
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,724
<i>A white woman.</i>

153
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,020
Africa for the Africans!

154
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,025
- Say "Roseland."
- Roseland.

155
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,361
Showtime!

156
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:14,239
Showtime!

157
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:44,811
Hi, Shorty!

158
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,481
You're too big!

159
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,359
- I'm gonna come get you.
- Oh, no.

160
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:58,325
Whoo! Come on, Shorty, I've gotta dance!

161
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,952
Oh! Yeah.

162
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:02,788
Hey!

163
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,796
You in charge, boy!

164
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,509
You like what you see, baby?

165
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,722
- No! Get back here!
- Go ahead, boy!

166
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:25,686
- Red, save me! Save me!
- Gotcha! Whoo! Yeah.

167
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:38,031
Come on, Shorty. I wanna dance again!

168
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,418
Shorty, Shorty! Shorty.

169
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:22,826
All right, Red. Shorty, Shorty!

170
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:45,724
Whoo! Whoo!

171
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,449
- Laura sure can go, can't she?
- Uh-huh.

172
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,701
- I gotta go freshen up.
- All right.

173
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,870
- You come on back now.
- All right, Malcolm.

174
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:52,666
Mm-mm-mm.
That chick is fine as May wine.

175
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:56,294
Except she lives up on a hill
and got a grandmother too.

176
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,839
She a church girl.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

177
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,612
Wanna dance?

178
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,949
Yeah.

179
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,098
So, what do they call you?

180
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,643
- Uh, Red.
- Red?

181
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:58,648
- I'm Sophia.
- How you doing, Sophia?

182
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,650
Very well, thank you.

183
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,028
I have an idea, Red.

184
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,950
Why don't you take that little girl home
and come on back?

185
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,332
- Wha--?
- Heh.

186
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,919
Just walk, baby, don't run.

187
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,714
It'll be here when you get back.

188
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,231
Well, I better not come in.

189
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,943
- I'm not stupid.
- What?

190
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,194
It's late, baby.

191
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:47,364
I know where you're going.
I am not a total square.

192
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,909
- I know what's happening--
- I gotta go home. It's late.

193
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:54,955
I gotta get up early in the morning.
I gotta work tomorrow.

194
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,292
I'll call you tomorrow?

195
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,044
What for?

196
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:05,966
I'm not white and I don't put out,
so why would you want to call me?

197
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,889
Good night, Mrs. Johnson.
I'll call you tomorrow.

198
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,525
Mm, heh.

199
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,029
Am I the first white woman
you've been with?

200
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:10,947
- Huh?
- Mm?

201
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,449
No, you ain't. Heh.

202
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,743
Shit, I done had plenty.

203
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,411
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

204
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,455
That isn't a whore?

205
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,710
Mm?

206
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,671
Heh.

207
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:34,345
Mm.

208
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,599
Take your time.

209
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:41,311
Sophia's not going anywhere.

210
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,897
I told you to walk...

211
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,816
- ...don't run.
- Shh.

212
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:51,071
I don't like women that talk too much.
Okay?

213
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,823
Heh. Okay.

214
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,160
Who wants to talk?

215
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:01,873
<i>At the end of each day</i>

216
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,377
<i>In a dream that's divine</i>

217
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,510
<i>My prayer</i>

218
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,178
<i>Is a rapture in blue</i>

219
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,889
- Yeah, Red!
- Come on, you missed me.

220
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,432
Eh, try this on for size.

221
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,772
- I ducked.
- You ducked?

222
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,233
You didn't! I got you
right between the toes!

223
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,903
I'm tired of playing the cops.
I wanna be Bogart.

224
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:34,989
Shorty, you're too small to be Bogart.

225
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:36,866
I'm not too short to be Cagney.

226
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,618
- Boom.
- Aah! You--!

227
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,662
- Boom.
- Oh, aah!

228
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,372
One more! Boom!

229
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,083
- Oh! Ha-ha-ha. Aw!
- Jesus.

230
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:50,296
You dirty, rotten, stinking copper!

231
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:58,138
You used to be a big shot.

232
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:05,270
There is just nothing I can do.

233
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,731
- What do you mean, took his own life?
- You heard the verdict.

234
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:13,736
Verdict? A man takes a hammer
and bashes in the back of his own head?

235
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,281
Then he lays on the tracks
and kills himself?

236
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,117
We merely act on the verdicts,
we don't make them.

237
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,244
Do you pay or don't you?

238
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,750
Read the policy, ma'am.

239
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:31,087
It clearly states....

240
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,555
Come here, Sophia.

241
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:52,192
You're the man.

242
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:55,612
Sit down.

243
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,453
What's your story?

244
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,082
You one of them white chicks can't get
enough colored studs. Is that what you are?

245
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,302
Kiss my foot.

246
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,640
Go ahead, kiss it.

247
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,525
Now, feed me.

248
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,002
Yeah.

249
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,171
Hmph.

250
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:57,173
That's your story, girl.

251
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:00,802
- So when you gonna holler rape, sister?
- Ha, me?

252
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,554
Yes, you.
You would, if the time came.

253
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,014
Sure you would.

254
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,558
Malcolm, let me feed you.

255
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,602
Come on.

256
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,188
While they're hot.

257
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,157
I wish your mother and father
could see you now.

258
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,910
And that ofay you're gonna marry.

259
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,204
I sure wish Laura could see us.

260
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,757
Please, Malcolm.

261
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,718
There's nobody around.

262
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,929
No, this ain't right.

263
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:30,600
- Why?
- Because you--

264
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:33,770
No, it's because of the white girl,
isn't it?

265
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,981
- It's not because of that.
- Folks say you run around with her.

266
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,441
It's not because of that.

267
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:42,445
Save it for Mr. Right.
Your grandmother's smarter than you think.

268
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:48,618
I'm sorry she raised me that way.

269
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,334
Is your mother alive?

270
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:57,585
Yes, she's alive.

271
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,090
When I was a kid, I was so poor
I thought "not for sale"...

272
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,467
...was a brand name.

273
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:07,678
- I did knock.
- Did you hear me say, "Come in"?

274
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:12,058
There's no point in fighting about it.
I'm sorry.

275
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:15,311
- May I sit down?
- You're nice enough to ask.

276
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,275
It's the same questions, Mrs. Little.

277
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:25,071
- Since your husband's death...
- Murder. Murder.

278
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:28,741
...there's a question
as to whether or not you are capable...

279
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,119
- ...of raising these children on your own.
- Oh....

280
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,329
These are my children.

281
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,707
They're mine.

282
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:39,377
And they ain't no question.

283
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:44,507
Sometimes I think, Mrs. Little,
candor is the only kindness.

284
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,884
All your children are delinquent...

285
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:51,097
- ...and one at least, Malcolm, is a thief.
- Get out of here!

286
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:54,809
Your control over your children
is therefore nonexistent.

287
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,477
Did you hear me?

288
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,481
You will regret this.

289
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:04,944
If you don't move out through that door,
you'll be past regretting!

290
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:11,200
<i>We were parceled out, all of us.</i>

291
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:15,746
<i>I truly believe that if ever
a state agency destroyed a family...</i>

292
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,457
<i>...it destroyed ours.</i>

293
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,711
<i>I was sent to a detention home
and lived at this woman's house.</i>

294
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:23,171
I know you'll keep it clean.

295
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:24,672
<i>Mrs. Swerlin.</i>

296
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:28,009
Boys, this is Malcolm, our new guest.

297
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,094
We'll treat him like a brother.

298
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:31,345
Reading the news--

299
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:34,599
<i>I was special.
The only colored kid in the class.</i>

300
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:38,227
<i>I became sort of a mascot,
like a pink poodle.</i>

301
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:42,482
<i>I got called a nigger so much,
I didn't think it was wrong.</i>

302
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,609
<i>I thought it was my name.</i>

303
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:50,364
<i>They talked about me like I wasn't there,
like I was a pedigreed dog or a horse...</i>

304
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,408
<i>...like I was invisible.</i>

305
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:56,496
The important thing is to be realistic.

306
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:59,207
We all like you here, you know that.

307
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,292
But you're a nigger...

308
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:04,795
...and a lawyer is no realistic goal
for a nigger.

309
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,590
But why, Mr. Ostrowski?

310
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:10,259
I gets the best grades in class.

311
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:13,888
I got voted class president.
I want to be a lawyer.

312
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:17,225
I want you to think about something
that you can be.

313
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:20,978
You're good with your hands,
making things.

314
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:24,732
People would give you work.
I would, myself.

315
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:27,276
Why don't you become a carpenter?

316
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,987
That's a good profession for a colored.

317
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,823
Wasn't your pa a carpenter?

318
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,743
Jesus was a carpenter.

319
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:39,956
People like you as a person.
You're doing real well.

320
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:43,417
Remember what we said:

321
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:46,420
"Nothing succeeds like success."
Let me hear it.

322
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:49,006
Nothing succeeds like success.

323
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,133
Right. As long as you're realistic.

324
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,803
It's not the end of the world, Malcolm.

325
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,682
I said, "Don't...

326
00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:00,935
...let them give that boy no pig."

327
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,312
<i>It wasn't the end of the world for me.</i>

328
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,731
<i>But it was the beginning of the end
for my mother.</i>

329
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:13,155
<i>A right cross to the jaw by Louis.</i>

330
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:19,996
<i>Louis takes Conn's head back
with a right uppercut.</i>

331
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:21,831
<i>Louis hits a left and a right.</i>

332
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:25,543
<i>And Conn is down
with a right cross to the jaw!</i>

333
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,336
<i>He's taking the count.</i>

334
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:30,214
<i>Four, five, six...</i>

335
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:34,135
<i>...seven.
He's on his back. Eight. Nine.</i>

336
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:38,264
<i>He's getting up!
No, the referee says it's all over!</i>

337
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:41,350
<i>- The referee says it's all over!</i>
- Yeah!

338
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:45,396
- What in hell is going on?
- Nothing, Mr. Cooper.

339
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:49,025
- There's a lot of hungry customers.
- Soup done finished.

340
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,985
That's right, Mr. Charlie.

341
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:52,945
The name is "Mr. Cooper."

342
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:54,822
Don't you forget it.

343
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,283
"Mr. Cooper."

344
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,997
What's the matter with you?
You want me to get fired!

345
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:04,457
I got a wife and six kids!

346
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:07,043
Mr. Cooper is good white folk!

347
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:09,712
You is a young fool!

348
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:13,674
Jesus.

349
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:20,765
<i>There'll never be another one like that!</i>

350
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:23,517
- Ha-ha-ha!
- He's done it!

351
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:26,062
<i>And by a knockout...</i>

352
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:29,774
<i>...and still the world's
heavyweight champion:</i>

353
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:32,193
<i>- Joe Louis!</i>
- Yeah!

354
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,153
Ham and cheese!
Excuse me, sir.

355
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:37,114
Ham and cheese here! I got coffee.

356
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,950
- Lemon meringue pie.
- Hey, boy!

357
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:43,579
- Ham and cheese.
- Yes, sir. Best in the house.

358
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:46,540
- You're pleased with yourself.
- I aims to please, sir.

359
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:47,875
I'm pleased to aim.

360
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:49,627
- I like you, boy.
- Thank you.

361
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:57,051
- Keep the change.
- Right, sir! Ham and cheese!

362
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,517
Ho! Ha-ha-ha.

363
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:06,060
Harlem!

364
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:30,668
<i>And here's Joe Louis,
back in Harlem.</i>

365
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:33,379
<i>They're celebrating!
They're going crazy!</i>

366
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:36,966
<i>They're dancing and cheering!
They're hanging from street signs!</i>

367
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:38,718
<i>Everybody's out!</i>

368
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:42,138
<i>Everyone's having a great time!
Listen to them roar!</i>

369
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:20,509
<i>Joe's a credit to his race.
What a fine gentleman!</i>

370
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,762
<i>But he's also a fine American.</i>

371
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:26,307
<i>The Brown Bomber, Joe Louis!</i>

372
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:30,269
- Hey, sugar.
- Huh?

373
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,980
- Slow down, daddy. What's your hurry?
- No hurry.

374
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:34,774
Let me show you something
brand-new, baby.

375
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,983
- No, ha, ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

376
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,985
I got gold watches, diamond rings.

377
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:41,363
- Any one of these. Whatever you need.
- I don't need that.

378
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:44,658
You need something, baby.
Whatever you need!

379
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,702
A couple of these make
a player look good.

380
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,316
Oof.

381
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:19,276
My man!

382
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:23,739
- The word is "excuse me," boy.
- "Excuse me" don't shine my shoes.

383
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:26,575
Then you should have stayed out
of my way.

384
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:29,954
Old country nigger.

385
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:36,168
Uh, heh. What you gonna do?

386
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,927
Go home to your mama?

387
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:58,858
Nigger, don't you ever, in your life,
say anything against my mother!

388
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,110
Get up.

389
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:21,881
Give me a whiskey.

390
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,808
I ordered a single, Jack.

391
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:35,561
The double's on that gentleman, "Jack."

392
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,400
Who is that?

393
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:44,403
That's West Indian Archie.

394
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,488
What's his angle?

395
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,326
Some of this, some of that.

396
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:05,674
Come closer, I'm not fixing to bite you.

397
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,844
You look like you're new in town.

398
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:12,181
From what I can see,
you're pretty handy with a bottle.

399
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:14,183
He had it coming.

400
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,060
Pull up a chair.

401
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:28,197
What do they call you?

402
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:29,698
Red.

403
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:31,784
And I ain't no punk.

404
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:33,369
You better not be.

405
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,830
Any cat toe you down here,
you stand up or make tracks.

406
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,333
- Man live by his rep.
- Better believe it.

407
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:44,922
- So, what do you do for yourself?
- Working on a train. Selling.

408
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:46,548
Like that job?

409
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:50,302
- Keeps me out of the Army.
- They want you, nothing will keep you out.

410
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,137
Not this boy.

411
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,641
So I hear tell
you're a good man to know.

412
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,227
- Where you hear that?
- Boston, where I'm from.

413
00:32:58,394 --> 00:32:59,603
Kiss my neck.

414
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:01,522
I've never been in Beantown.

415
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,566
Like the man said, a man's rep travels.

416
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:06,902
How about that.

417
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,280
You bullshitting me?

418
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:13,534
My father told me
never bullshit a West Indian.

419
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,328
- Your daddy's West Indian?
- My mama.

420
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:18,747
She's from Grenada.

421
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:20,332
- Grenada.
- Ha, ha.

422
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:27,464
I like this guy. I like you, country.
Ha-ha-ha.

423
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:29,591
Grenada.

424
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:32,344
Where'd you get them
goddamn vines you got on?

425
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:35,389
And them shoes? Oh, my.

426
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:37,057
We can do something about that.

427
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:40,519
But he's putting a hurting
on my vision, man. Damn.

428
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:41,854
Relax.

429
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,940
- So how can I get ahold of you?
- You can't.

430
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,109
I get ahold of you.

431
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:49,486
- All right, I'll write it down.
- Mm-mm.

432
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,530
Don't ever write anything down.

433
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:53,449
File it up here.

434
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:55,200
Like I do.

435
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:59,455
If the man don't have any paper,
he will never have any proof.

436
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:01,040
Dig?

437
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:02,875
Yeah. Heh.

438
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:05,169
Yeah, I dig. Right.

439
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:11,300
Look me in the face.

440
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:13,135
Did you, just now, con me?

441
00:34:16,055 --> 00:34:17,139
Yes, sir.

442
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:20,184
- Why?
- Because I want in.

443
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,729
It don't take a lot to know
you're already there.

444
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:25,606
At least he ain't lying.

445
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,232
I have a run to make.

446
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:30,444
- Let me make that run with you, Mr. Archie.
- Mm-mm.

447
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:39,995
I like your heart.

448
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,748
I like your style.

449
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,709
You might just do, Mr. Red.

450
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:49,129
Unless, of course, you have to get back
to your train job.

451
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:51,465
I've told him what to do
with that train.

452
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:52,883
- When?
- Just now.

453
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,515
All right.

454
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:01,433
Come with me.

455
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,519
I'm taking you shopping.

456
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,939
Cadillac's the name.

457
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:09,358
Sammy, man.

458
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,194
- You ready?
- Good.

459
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:17,533
Button more buttons on the jacket.

460
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:27,876
- You look good.
- Yes, man. Ha, ha.

461
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:29,419
But you're missing something.

462
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:30,921
- Frisk me.
- What?

463
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:33,048
Go ahead, frisk me.

464
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:42,850
Nothing, right?

465
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,274
I'm still carrying.

466
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,317
This was my first gun.

467
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:55,112
Now it's yours.

468
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:03,537
Thank you.

469
00:36:03,704 --> 00:36:04,997
You wear it...

470
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,249
...wear it so.

471
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,169
Small of the back.

472
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,672
Now you're outfitted.

473
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:18,343
- You ready to tackle the streets?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

474
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:20,053
Let them come.

475
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:25,058
Let us now turn
to the Gospel According to St. John.

476
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:26,602
Chapter 3...

477
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:29,521
...verse 23.

478
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:31,190
323.

479
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:35,777
"And John also was baptizing
in Aenon near Salim...

480
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:40,490
...because there was much water.

481
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:44,828
And they came...

482
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:47,706
...and were baptized."

483
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,543
313.

484
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:54,421
255.

485
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:56,632
It got to be 251.

486
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,133
403.

487
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,219
I saw it in my dream.

488
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:02,846
555.

489
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:05,557
- What you know, daddy-o?
- I feel straight.

490
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:07,976
Mm. Your lucky day.

491
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:10,145
- Roll it for me.
- Ha-ha-ha.

492
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,232
I told you, no paper, no trouble.

493
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,150
I'm working on it.

494
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:18,654
I keep all my numbers in my head.

495
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,741
I've never written a number down yet.
Remember that.

496
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:38,840
Your turn.

497
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:46,306
Easy.

498
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:50,978
Easy.

499
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,482
- You there?
- If I ain't, I'm right next door.

500
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:59,653
Nothing in this world can give you
that real deep cool.

501
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:01,530
The girl.

502
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:20,632
About as mellow as I can be.

503
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,180
Cool enough to kill.

504
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:28,765
I realize that.

505
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:33,729
- Easy, easy, easy, easy.
- Stick them up.

506
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,525
Hey, Archie.

507
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:41,028
Ow!

508
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:42,237
Baby....

509
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,743
- Boo! Ha-ha-ha.
- Aah!

510
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:50,120
Malcolm, you're so funny.

511
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:54,082
Give me some money, baby.

512
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:58,670
Okay.

513
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:01,298
Come on, baby.

514
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:03,342
The bitch move too slow.

515
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:10,599
Sometimes this guy
has a big ugly mouth.

516
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:12,267
What time is it, baby?

517
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:17,022
- 8:21.
- 8:21, I like that. Combinate me.

518
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,358
- 821.
- Careful, Red.

519
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:21,651
- 128.
- Ha-ha-ha.

520
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:24,071
218.

521
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:27,741
- I'm taking the bet.
- Yeah, bet.

522
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:31,787
Time to reload. Time to reload.

523
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:04,736
- Say, Red!
- Red, back again, huh?

524
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:22,587
I thought you said we was going
to the movies last night.

525
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,757
- You said that.
- I'm sorry. I say a lot of things.

526
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,135
- I believed you.
- Do your job, now.

527
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:30,679
Get me a pack of Lucky Strikes
and a cognac.

528
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:45,026
Daniel come in yet?

529
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,695
Ain't that him now?

530
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:48,530
Gorgeous!

531
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:52,159
How you been today?
You been waiting long?

532
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:57,038
Let me look at you. Wow.

533
00:40:57,372 --> 00:41:00,834
- I've been missing you today, Laura.
- How you doing, baby?

534
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:04,379
I'm all right. Copacetic. Great.
Did you work today?

535
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:07,924
No. You know what time I wound up
last night. I didn't go to work.

536
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:10,635
- I need a five-spot.
- I gave you 10 this morning.

537
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:13,555
Laura, give me the goddamn $5!

538
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:17,058
It ain't the money.
I just wanna make sure you're okay, baby.

539
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:19,519
I gotta pay back this guy.

540
00:41:20,187 --> 00:41:21,396
I'll be right back.

541
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:24,149
Like last time?

542
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,318
I swear, I'll be right back.

543
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:28,570
Laura, I love you.

544
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:38,580
You know that chick?

545
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:43,710
- What, you a private detective now?
- Just asking.

546
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:46,004
Don't ask me no goddamn questions.

547
00:41:46,213 --> 00:41:47,422
I ask you the questions.

548
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:49,591
- You understand?
- Mm-hm.

549
00:41:49,758 --> 00:41:52,135
- She come in here a lot?
- Almost every night.

550
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:53,720
- With him?
- Mm-hm.

551
00:41:55,055 --> 00:41:58,433
- She know he's strung out?
- If she got eyes, she do.

552
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:03,021
- She ain't hooking, is she?
- Not yet, Red.

553
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:06,691
But the way things are,
he'll turn her out any day now.

554
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:13,198
You stuck on her, huh?

555
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:18,495
See, that's your problem, girl. You need to
mind your own goddamn business, or I'm--

556
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:21,289
Don't do that!

557
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:24,292
- I wanna talk to you, all right? Have a seat.
- All right.

558
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,336
- All right?
- All right.

559
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:35,637
- Don't pay him any mind, hear?
- All right.

560
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:38,014
- You all right?
- I'm all right.

561
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,273
You buy yourself something nice.

562
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,286
Hey, baby.

563
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:06,001
Give me a light.

564
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:18,847
You look uptight. What is the problem?

565
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:20,015
- No problem.
- Sure?

566
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:23,977
Everything's all right.
I'm not worrying about it.

567
00:43:24,144 --> 00:43:25,645
All right.

568
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:27,981
I'm thinking about my money. Heh.

569
00:43:28,148 --> 00:43:29,941
Six big ones you owe me, Archie.

570
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:32,319
- What?
- 821. It hit, didn't it?

571
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:34,070
You didn't have 821.

572
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:37,991
Were you high? I threw the slats at you,
told you to combinate me.

573
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:42,203
- I'm telling you, you never had it.
- I tell you I did. Sophia was there.

574
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:44,122
Archie, you remember, don't you?

575
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:46,249
- Wait, what you expect her to say?
- Ugh.

576
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:48,418
Don't do this.

577
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:49,669
All right?

578
00:43:50,045 --> 00:43:51,379
All right.

579
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,050
All right, skip it.

580
00:43:55,342 --> 00:43:56,926
But you're slipping, Archie?

581
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:59,679
You done slipped.

582
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:04,392
Archie, wait.

583
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:17,822
Come on, Archie. Look....

584
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:21,576
Come on. You want a drink
or something? I'm buying.

585
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:24,287
- I ain't drinking with you.
- Oh, Archie.

586
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:26,665
All right?

587
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:32,045
Come, Sam.

588
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:35,423
I'll be right there, man.

589
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:44,182
Twenty-two years.

590
00:44:44,391 --> 00:44:48,019
Twenty-two years,
I never knowed him to forget a number.

591
00:44:48,228 --> 00:44:49,688
First time for everything.

592
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:51,773
What are you talking about?

593
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:56,569
The first thing he'll do is check
with the collector for an oversight.

594
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:59,823
His rep is on the line. So is yours.

595
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:04,953
And, Red, if you're lying,
you're a dead man.

596
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:08,915
Dead, dead, dead.

597
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:12,377
You go and tell him that.

598
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:21,302
My man, Red.

599
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,304
Night to you.

600
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,976
I don't understand Archie.
You had the number.

601
00:45:30,145 --> 00:45:34,190
<i>Away from the city</i>

602
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:37,527
<i>That hurts and mocks</i>

603
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:41,990
<i>I'm standin' alone</i>

604
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:45,827
<i>By the desolate docks</i>

605
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:50,665
<i>In the still and the chill</i>

606
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:53,752
<i>Of the night</i>

607
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,839
<i>I see the horizon</i>

608
00:45:59,299 --> 00:46:01,509
<i>The great unknown</i>

609
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:04,304
Didn't I tell you never sit
with your back to no door?

610
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:10,226
<i>It's as heavy as stone</i>

611
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:11,519
You know what?

612
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:15,356
You're a damn liar.

613
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:16,941
And so is she.

614
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:22,197
So you figure to take me...

615
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:23,990
...you bastard?

616
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:26,075
Well, I'm taking you.

617
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:28,620
- So it's you and me, huh?
- That's right.

618
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:30,413
I'll give you back the $600.

619
00:46:30,622 --> 00:46:32,373
- I don't want it.
- I'm wearing.

620
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,710
There's three guns on you,
so you take your chances, my friend.

621
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:38,505
<i>Will the one I love</i>

622
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,801
<i>Be coming back</i>

623
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:46,888
<i>To me?</i>

624
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:50,225
- Let's walk.
- Heh.

625
00:46:53,228 --> 00:46:55,855
<i>I cover</i>

626
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:59,359
So this is how I'm going out,
huh, Archie?

627
00:46:59,526 --> 00:47:02,070
- In a toe-down?
- Toe-down, yes.

628
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:06,658
- Let's go.
- Why don't we let Billie finish first.

629
00:47:07,075 --> 00:47:09,619
- No.
- Red.

630
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:14,874
<i>Must soon come back</i>

631
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:22,632
<i>To me</i>

632
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:29,472
- Come here!
- Get him!

633
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:31,558
- He's got a gun!
- Ugh!

634
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,563
<i>For the one I love</i>

635
00:47:36,855 --> 00:47:39,274
<i>Must soon come back</i>

636
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,776
You better run! You're going down!

637
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:47,115
<i>To me</i>

638
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:53,329
<i>Thank you.</i>

639
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:56,291
<i>Thank you very much. Thank you.</i>

640
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:19,981
Wake up.

641
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:23,526
- Wake up!
- Oof.

642
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:26,154
There's somebody out there.

643
00:48:29,324 --> 00:48:30,825
Wake the kids.

644
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:43,463
Malcolm!

645
00:48:44,881 --> 00:48:47,467
Follow me! Wait! Wait!

646
00:48:50,303 --> 00:48:52,096
- Go! Go!
- Aah!

647
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:55,558
Careful!

648
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:02,732
- Good thing we're all good Christians.
- It's time for you to leave this town.

649
00:49:02,941 --> 00:49:04,067
It's a free country.

650
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:07,779
We warned you about Garvey preaching!
Stirring up the good niggras!

651
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:09,030
I ain't a boy!

652
00:49:09,197 --> 00:49:10,865
- I'm a man!
- You're a dead nigger.

653
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:13,785
And a real man don't hide behind
no bed sheets!

654
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:16,496
You take these here bullets
for them sheets!

655
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:25,505
I know you're a better shot than that.

656
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:27,382
You should've killed them.

657
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:31,761
- You should've shot all them crackers dead.
- I just wanted to scare them.

658
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:35,264
They won't be around here
bothering us no more.

659
00:49:36,808 --> 00:49:39,018
They won't be here no time soon.

660
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:40,937
I'm a man!

661
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:45,233
That'll teach you, nigger.

662
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:52,573
<i>Get a doctor!</i>

663
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,534
<i>He doesn't need a doctor,
he needs a preacher.</i>

664
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:58,454
I'm glad we got you out of there.

665
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:01,708
With Archie on your ass,
your name on the wire...

666
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:04,002
...Boston's the best
goddamn place for you.

667
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:05,420
Yeah.

668
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:07,797
We'll take it easy, huh, baby?

669
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:11,676
I got a place fixed up for us
on Harvard Square. How's that sound?

670
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:14,679
Sounds good. We'll lay low for a while.

671
00:50:15,138 --> 00:50:18,266
Don't you worry about a thing.
I'll stake you, baby.

672
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:23,229
I got my band. I'm blowing great sax.
Hell, Red, you ain't even heard us play yet!

673
00:50:23,438 --> 00:50:25,481
<i>Like every hustler, I was trapped.</i>

674
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:27,817
<i>Cats that hung together
to find security...</i>

675
00:50:28,026 --> 00:50:30,153
<i>...to find an answer, found nothing.</i>

676
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:32,488
<i>Cats that might've cured cancer.</i>

677
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:35,575
<i>West Indian Archie might've been
a mathematical genius.</i>

678
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:38,786
<i>We were all victims
of the American social order.</i>

679
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,749
<i>Until that time, there were three things
I was always afraid of:</i>

680
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:45,877
<i>A job, a bust and jail.</i>

681
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:50,423
<i>But I realized then that I wasn't afraid
of anything. I was an animal.</i>

682
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:52,925
He don't look too good.

683
00:50:55,303 --> 00:50:57,305
We're gonna rob this town blind.

684
00:50:57,472 --> 00:50:59,223
Anybody want out, say so now.

685
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:04,103
Good. Okay, I set up a stake,
and I got somebody to move the goods.

686
00:51:04,312 --> 00:51:06,522
We need a driver. Any suggestions?

687
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:08,357
- How about Rudy?
- Yeah, Rudy.

688
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:10,318
Who's Rudy?

689
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,906
I'm half-wop, half-nigger.
I'm not afraid of nobody.

690
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:17,325
Yeah, right? Huh.

691
00:51:17,492 --> 00:51:19,994
- So, what do you do?
- Name it, I claim it.

692
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:22,747
Rudy does catering.
Rich joints on Beacon Hill.

693
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:25,166
- All right.
- Tell him about Baldy.

694
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:27,835
- Baldy. Ha-ha-ha.
- Yeah. Yeah.

695
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:30,338
He's this old, rich ofay motherfucker.

696
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:32,590
I give him a bath every Friday night.

697
00:51:32,799 --> 00:51:36,636
Towel him off,
talcum powder on him, put him to bed.

698
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:38,971
Just like a baby.
He gets his jollies off.

699
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,264
What about him?

700
00:51:40,473 --> 00:51:44,435
Guy's got jewelry. He's got
a coin collection. He's got china.

701
00:51:44,644 --> 00:51:46,896
- Ah. That might be all right.
- He's got rugs.

702
00:51:47,105 --> 00:51:50,817
Shit, I know this town, man.
I got my own fences.

703
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:54,112
Who is this guy, huh?

704
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:56,280
Who put you in charge?

705
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:59,200
- You wanna be in charge?
- I am in charge.

706
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:02,578
- You head nigger in charge.
- Ha, ha. I'm the head nigger in charge.

707
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:05,248
Big-head nigger, that's what you are.

708
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:08,209
I'll tell you what we'll do, Rudy.

709
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:10,211
Because I'm a fair man...

710
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:13,381
...and I like big-head niggers like you.

711
00:52:14,215 --> 00:52:15,550
We'll flip for it.

712
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,594
We'll flip this.

713
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:24,225
Red.

714
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:26,519
She loves me.

715
00:52:27,395 --> 00:52:29,188
She loves me not.

716
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:31,732
She loves me.

717
00:52:33,401 --> 00:52:35,236
She loves me not.

718
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:38,698
Ah. She loves me.

719
00:52:54,297 --> 00:52:55,381
I'll flip first.

720
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:58,593
Red, cool it. Come on.

721
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,595
Head man in charge, right?

722
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:02,763
Put the gun down.

723
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:05,474
All right, we believe you.

724
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:07,685
We believe you.

725
00:53:08,895 --> 00:53:11,731
Red, stop clowning around, all right?
For chrissakes.

726
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:13,232
Your turn, Rudy.

727
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:15,776
Quit fooling around. Come on, guys.

728
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:23,242
You don't wanna flip?

729
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,120
- Let me show you. I'll do it again.
- Don't!

730
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:28,247
Rudy doesn't know how.
I have to show him.

731
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:30,541
- Red.
- Did you miss something?

732
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:33,586
You got your eyes open?
Look at me, Rudy.

733
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:36,088
You don't have to do this, Red.

734
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:39,300
- Red--! Ugh.
- That was really dumb.

735
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:46,807
Your flip, baby. You wanna do it?
No, you don't, do you?

736
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:48,309
I'll help you.

737
00:53:48,643 --> 00:53:50,394
- Here.
- Red, don't.

738
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:55,066
Should we shoot that
wop nose of yours off?

739
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:58,778
Or is that the nigger side?
Is that the wop side or the nigger side?

740
00:53:59,195 --> 00:54:02,406
Is that wop or nigger?
I guess that's the wop side.

741
00:54:02,657 --> 00:54:03,991
I'm not going to jail.

742
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:07,203
Put the gun away, Red.
Come on, this is enough.

743
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:09,497
Say goodbye, Rudy.

744
00:54:10,623 --> 00:54:12,041
Huh?

745
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:17,213
I think I heard Rudy said something.
What did you say, Rudy?

746
00:54:17,964 --> 00:54:20,466
- Speak up.
- Okay.

747
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:25,680
Jesus Christ! When are you gonna stop?

748
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:28,683
I did two, so I owe you two, right?

749
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:30,142
You got it.

750
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:33,020
- "I got it." What did you say?
- You got it.

751
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:34,855
Rudy says I got it.

752
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:38,192
Rudy, don't you ever...

753
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:41,696
...try and cross someone
who ain't afraid to die, you hear me?

754
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:44,490
All right.

755
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:46,575
This is what we'll do.

756
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:49,203
We'll hit old Talcum Powder tonight.

757
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:52,456
My friend Rudy here
is gonna draw up the plans.

758
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:55,001
Everything that's in the house, right?

759
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:59,171
Peg, Sophia, you go out
and get those tools like I asked you.

760
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,299
We're gonna hit tonight
because some of us...

761
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:04,302
- ...have high visibility during the day.
Ha-ha-ha.

762
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:09,348
It's okay with you, right, Rudy?

763
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:14,895
Merry Christmas, Rudy.

764
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:16,897
One big, happy family.

765
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:21,694
I love you.

766
00:55:37,335 --> 00:55:39,086
Psst! Red.

767
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,595
What happened to the bullet?
Did you palm that bullet?

768
00:55:47,762 --> 00:55:48,929
What bullet?

769
00:55:49,305 --> 00:55:50,598
The bullet.

770
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:54,560
- Ha-ha-ha.
- You're crazy.

771
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:07,031
Shorty!

772
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:21,545
Shh!

773
00:56:24,215 --> 00:56:26,675
Easy, Shorty. Easy.

774
00:56:29,637 --> 00:56:31,514
Shorty.

775
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:36,203
My man, Red.

776
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:38,956
My man!

777
00:57:39,707 --> 00:57:42,668
Heh. When's Rudy due back?

778
00:57:43,711 --> 00:57:45,212
Thirty minutes.

779
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:50,217
I'm almost finished.

780
00:57:56,557 --> 00:57:59,685
Girls ought to be getting back
from casing that rug joint.

781
00:57:59,894 --> 00:58:01,187
They should be.

782
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,565
We've done a good job. Ha, ha.

783
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:06,567
Ha-ha-ha. We're killing them, ain't we?

784
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:12,323
- They don't know what's hitting them.
- Yeah, ha-ha-ha-.

785
00:58:12,573 --> 00:58:15,701
- Let me work back in this kitchen.
- You getting the kitchen?

786
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:18,245
That's where the naps are,
in the kitchen.

787
00:58:18,454 --> 00:58:22,249
If you can't take the heat,
get on out of the kitchen.

788
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:26,212
- All right, let's go to the sink.
- Sure.

789
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,217
Come on, it's starting to heat up.

790
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:33,427
- Burning?
- Yeah. It's all right.

791
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:36,722
Put your head down.

792
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:41,227
- Come on, man. Huh?
- I turned it.

793
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:51,570
It's started to sting.
Get out of the way!

794
00:58:56,951 --> 00:58:59,620
- It's burning?
- Hell, yeah, it's burning!

795
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:04,959
Goddamn it!

796
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:14,009
Hey, nigger, take your head out
of the shit bowl!

797
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:15,678
That's it. Get up slowly.

798
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:19,306
Hey! Watch it! No funny business, now.

799
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:21,976
Red, the jig is up.

800
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:24,853
<i>The average first offender
gets two years for burglary.</i>

801
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:28,232
<i>We were all first offenders.
That's what the girls drew.</i>

802
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,901
Two years in the women's reformatory.

803
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,486
<i>Our crime wasn't burglary.</i>

804
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:36,323
<i>It was sleeping with white girls.
They threw the book at us.</i>

805
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:39,535
Burglary, count one, 8 to 10 years.

806
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:41,996
Count two, 8 to 10 years.

807
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:44,707
- Count three, 8 to 10 years.
- Ha, ha.

808
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:47,209
Count four, 8 to 10 years.

809
00:59:47,418 --> 00:59:49,545
Count five, 8 to 10 years.

810
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:54,508
Count six, 8 to 10 years.
Count seven, 8 to 10 years.

811
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,011
Count eight, 8 to 10 years.

812
00:59:57,177 --> 01:00:01,682
Count nine, 8 to 10 years.
Count 10, 8 to 10 years.

813
01:00:01,849 --> 01:00:06,437
Count 11, 8 to 10 years.
Count 12, 8 to 10 years.

814
01:00:06,729 --> 01:00:10,107
Count 13, 8 to 10 years,
and count 14--

815
01:00:10,316 --> 01:00:12,943
<i>Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.</i>

816
01:00:13,152 --> 01:00:14,570
Sentences to run concurrently.

817
01:00:14,737 --> 01:00:17,698
<i>Ha, ha. Shorty thought
he'd hit us with over 100 years...</i>

818
01:00:17,865 --> 01:00:20,159
<i>...until I explained
what concurrently meant.</i>

819
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:22,870
<i>It meant a minimum of
10 years hard labor...</i>

820
01:00:23,037 --> 01:00:25,372
<i>...at the Charlestown State Prison.</i>

821
01:00:25,581 --> 01:00:27,791
<i>The date was February 1946.</i>

822
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,168
<i>Fuck you.</i>

823
01:00:35,049 --> 01:00:37,301
Cellblock A, secure.

824
01:01:11,377 --> 01:01:13,253
Close five!

825
01:01:14,463 --> 01:01:15,756
Look at Satan.

826
01:01:15,923 --> 01:01:17,091
I see him.

827
01:01:17,383 --> 01:01:19,176
He about to bust?

828
01:01:19,385 --> 01:01:22,888
He not gonna bust.
He wouldn't give them the pleasure.

829
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:24,890
Little!

830
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:30,396
- State your number.
- Little!

831
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:33,023
- What?
- Give him a break.

832
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,443
- He's a new fish.
- Okay, I'll give him a break.

833
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:39,530
Now state your number, Little.

834
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,282
- I forgot it.
- State it.

835
01:01:42,491 --> 01:01:45,035
- I forgot it.
- You can read it right there, boy!

836
01:01:45,285 --> 01:01:47,246
- Can't you read, boy?
- Fuck you!

837
01:01:47,413 --> 01:01:49,415
- Ugh!
- I'll teach you a lesson!

838
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:53,836
I forgot it!

839
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:55,379
I forgot it!

840
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:56,839
I forgot it!

841
01:01:57,756 --> 01:02:00,551
I forgot it. Agh!

842
01:02:02,553 --> 01:02:04,972
They ain't gonna break me down.

843
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:09,059
Yeah, that's the kind of nigger I am.
They ain't gonna break me down.

844
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:12,813
I'm in this situation,
and I'm getting out.

845
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,441
Anything go wrong, I'm strong.

846
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:18,444
Time's up, Little.

847
01:02:19,153 --> 01:02:20,904
Now, state your number.

848
01:02:23,741 --> 01:02:26,410
Suit yourself. Ten more days.

849
01:02:30,748 --> 01:02:31,832
Water!

850
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,585
Water!

851
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:53,187
You want a smoke?

852
01:03:01,779 --> 01:03:03,864
You know what a friend
you have in Jesus, son?

853
01:03:04,031 --> 01:03:06,992
Heh. A friend? Huh?

854
01:03:08,202 --> 01:03:11,497
He's a friend, huh, chappy?
If he's such a friend, where is he? Huh?

855
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:12,915
What's he done for me?

856
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:14,458
A friend! Ha.

857
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:18,128
Tell you what you do,
you tell him to call me.

858
01:03:18,796 --> 01:03:20,923
Call me and tell me
what kind of friend he is.

859
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:23,675
Solitary 2-2607.

860
01:03:23,884 --> 01:03:26,011
What he done for me, chappy? Huh?

861
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:28,180
Where is he when I need him, huh?

862
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:32,226
You tell me that! Where is this Jesus?
I'll tell you where he is.

863
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:35,854
He's out with the police captain!
I'll straighten him out!

864
01:03:36,063 --> 01:03:39,149
What's he done for me?
He ain't done nothing for me!

865
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:43,153
Done nothing for me.

866
01:03:43,821 --> 01:03:47,533
"What a friend we have in Jesus."
Jesus can kiss my ass!

867
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:51,328
Tell Jesus to kiss my ass.
How about that? Tell him that.

868
01:04:45,132 --> 01:04:46,133
Little.

869
01:04:46,758 --> 01:04:48,093
Little.

870
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,470
State your number, Little.

871
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:52,973
Come on, state it!

872
01:04:53,974 --> 01:04:55,517
A-22....

873
01:04:55,684 --> 01:04:56,727
What?

874
01:04:56,894 --> 01:04:58,729
A-228....

875
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:01,148
Come on.

876
01:05:17,748 --> 01:05:19,249
I know how you feel.

877
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:21,543
Like you want to lay down and die.

878
01:05:23,795 --> 01:05:25,339
I brought you something.

879
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:28,383
Yeah, I don't need
no more favors from you.

880
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:31,303
It's nutmeg. Put it in the water.

881
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:34,222
You need something
to get the monkey off your back.

882
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:36,934
It's not cocaine,
but it'll help some.

883
01:05:43,815 --> 01:05:46,526
Drink it slow.
The stuff is strong.

884
01:05:53,784 --> 01:05:55,160
So, what's your hype?

885
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:59,164
I can show you how to get out
of prison. And it's no hype.

886
01:05:59,373 --> 01:06:01,541
Talk, daddy-o. I'm listening.

887
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:06,672
- This ain't bad. You got some more?
- That's the last fix I'm giving you.

888
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:09,341
So why'd you give it to me?

889
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:13,720
Because you needed it.
Because you couldn't hear me without it.

890
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:17,391
Nigger, get on out of my face.

891
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:20,936
I think you got more sense
than any cat in this prison.

892
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:23,188
Why the hell don't you use it?

893
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:28,443
You can't bust out of here
like they do in the movies.

894
01:06:28,819 --> 01:06:31,154
Even if you get out,
you're still in prison.

895
01:06:31,363 --> 01:06:32,656
You ain't lying there.

896
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:36,827
You'll bang against a stone wall.
You're not using your brain!

897
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:38,954
That's what the white man wants.

898
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:42,541
Look at you, putting all
that poison in your hair.

899
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:47,170
I think you been in prison too long,
because everybody on the outside conks.

900
01:06:47,379 --> 01:06:49,673
Why does everybody on the outside conk?

901
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:53,010
They don't want to walk around
with a nappy head, looking like--

902
01:06:53,218 --> 01:06:54,302
Looking like me?

903
01:06:54,553 --> 01:06:55,887
Like a nigger?

904
01:06:57,389 --> 01:06:59,099
Why not look like what you are?

905
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:01,852
What makes you ashamed of being black?

906
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:05,522
Let me tell you something.
I'm not ashamed of being anything.

907
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:11,611
You better let go.
I gotta wash this out.

908
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:14,823
- Let it burn!
- Nigger, get your hands off of me!

909
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:17,951
Go on. Burn yourself. Pain yourself.

910
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:21,038
Put all that poison in your hair,
in your body, trying to be white!

911
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:27,210
- I don't want to hear this shit.
- I thought you were smart.

912
01:07:27,419 --> 01:07:29,838
But you just another cat
strutting down the avenue...

913
01:07:30,005 --> 01:07:32,215
...in your clown suit
with all that mess on you!

914
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:33,633
Looking like a monkey!

915
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:37,804
The white man sees you and laughs
because he knows you ain't white.

916
01:07:38,013 --> 01:07:41,349
- Man, who are you?
- No, the question is, who are you?

917
01:07:42,768 --> 01:07:44,019
I'll tell you.

918
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:47,022
You are lost in the darkness.

919
01:07:49,066 --> 01:07:51,735
But Elijah Muhammad has come
to bring you into the light.

920
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:54,613
- Who?
- Elijah Muhammad...

921
01:07:54,863 --> 01:07:57,365
...can get you out of prison.

922
01:07:58,283 --> 01:08:00,535
Out of the prison of your mind.

923
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:04,372
But maybe all you want is another fix.

924
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:22,516
--you get used to this life,
and it puts you to sleep.

925
01:08:22,724 --> 01:08:25,560
You stop thinking and acting
for yourself.

926
01:08:26,269 --> 01:08:30,190
If you had to scrounge 3 squares
a day outside, you'd cut your throats.

927
01:08:30,357 --> 01:08:33,527
So you let them feed you,
give you dominoes to play with.

928
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:37,155
- Let you shoot marbles, play baseball.
- Let's go. Cut the sermon.

929
01:08:37,364 --> 01:08:41,201
He blows his whistle and you sit,
you stand, you grab, gobble...

930
01:08:41,368 --> 01:08:42,410
...file out...

931
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:46,790
- ...sleep, and sing out your number.
- I told you to knock it off.

932
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:50,043
Now...

933
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:51,962
...are you gonna take yard?

934
01:08:54,131 --> 01:08:55,632
I'm staying.

935
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:57,217
Uh, yeah, me too.

936
01:09:08,395 --> 01:09:10,438
What are you sniffing around for?

937
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:13,316
I told you, I gave you your last fix.

938
01:09:17,112 --> 01:09:19,406
What's your angle, nigger? Hmm?

939
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:23,118
"Nigger"?
Who's wearing the conk?

940
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:27,414
You the only cat in this prison
I done seen act the way you do.

941
01:09:27,956 --> 01:09:30,876
You ain't afraid of talking like that
in front of guards.

942
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:33,712
What's he gonna do to me
he hasn't done already?

943
01:09:35,589 --> 01:09:39,885
I mean, you don't cuss none. You don't
talk that "What-ya-know-daddy" jive.

944
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:43,930
A man curses because he doesn't have
the words to say what's on his mind.

945
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,435
Yeah.

946
01:09:49,269 --> 01:09:51,938
I know you gotta angle
some kind of way.

947
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,233
Don't con me.

948
01:09:56,276 --> 01:09:58,612
Don't con me and don't try.

949
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:03,700
Hey, just offering you a cigarette,
my man. Ain't no big deal.

950
01:10:09,664 --> 01:10:11,708
I read, study.

951
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:14,878
The first thing a black man
must have is self-respect.

952
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:17,297
Respect his body and his mind.

953
01:10:17,464 --> 01:10:20,091
Quit taking the white man's poisons
into his body.

954
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:24,971
His cigarettes, his dope, his liquor,
his white women, his pork.

955
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:26,848
Pork?

956
01:10:27,349 --> 01:10:28,516
Hmm.

957
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:33,396
My mama used to say don't eat no pork.

958
01:10:33,605 --> 01:10:38,026
Your mama was right.
That pig is a filthy beast.

959
01:10:38,235 --> 01:10:41,655
Part rat, part cat and the rest is dog.

960
01:10:41,863 --> 01:10:44,241
All right, pull my coat on this, now.

961
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:46,660
What happen if you give all that up?

962
01:10:47,118 --> 01:10:50,538
I mean, the pork. You get sick
and you get a medical or something?

963
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:54,251
Like when I was on the outside,
I ran this hustle. I tried--

964
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:57,796
I'm telling you God's words,
not no hustle.

965
01:10:58,004 --> 01:11:00,840
And I'm gonna tell you God is black.

966
01:11:01,049 --> 01:11:03,927
God is black?
Everybody knows God is white.

967
01:11:04,094 --> 01:11:06,346
Everything the white man taught you,
you accepted.

968
01:11:06,513 --> 01:11:09,349
He taught you you were
a black heathen, and you believed him.

969
01:11:09,516 --> 01:11:12,352
He taught you to worship a blond,
blue-eyed Jesus...

970
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,146
...with white skin
and you believed him.

971
01:11:15,814 --> 01:11:18,733
He taught you that black was a curse,
and you believed that.

972
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:21,486
- Ever look up the word "black"?
- For what?

973
01:11:21,695 --> 01:11:24,030
Did you ever study anything
that wasn't a con?

974
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:25,740
What the hell for, man?

975
01:11:28,576 --> 01:11:29,619
Come with me.

976
01:11:33,415 --> 01:11:36,042
"Black: Destitute of light...

977
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:37,585
...devoid of color.

978
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:39,587
Enveloped in darkness...

979
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:42,215
...hence utterly dismal or gloomy...

980
01:11:42,382 --> 01:11:46,261
- ...as, 'The future looked black.""
- Pretty good with them words, ain't you?

981
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:47,804
"Soiled with dirt...

982
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:49,222
...foul.

983
01:11:49,431 --> 01:11:51,182
Sullen, hostile...

984
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:54,394
...forbidding, as, 'a black day.'

985
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:57,981
Foully or outrageously wicked...

986
01:11:58,189 --> 01:11:59,733
...as, 'black cruelty.'

987
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:03,695
Indicating disgrace,
dishonor or culpability."

988
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:08,116
And there's others.
"Blackmail. Blackball. Blackguard."

989
01:12:08,325 --> 01:12:09,743
That's something, all right.

990
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:11,745
Let's look up "white."

991
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:16,249
Here.

992
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,960
Read.

993
01:12:21,379 --> 01:12:22,797
"White:

994
01:12:23,465 --> 01:12:25,550
The color of pure snow.

995
01:12:26,134 --> 01:12:29,763
Uh, reflecting all the rays
of the spectrum.

996
01:12:30,305 --> 01:12:31,431
The opposite of black.

997
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:36,561
Um....

998
01:12:36,728 --> 01:12:39,105
Free from spot or blemish.

999
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:42,817
Innocent. Pure."

1000
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:46,112
Huh.

1001
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:49,699
Ain't this something?
"Without evil intent.

1002
01:12:49,908 --> 01:12:51,076
Harmless.

1003
01:12:51,534 --> 01:12:55,121
Honest, square-dealing and honorable."
Wait a minute.

1004
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:58,583
This was written by white folks, right?
White folks' book?

1005
01:12:58,792 --> 01:13:01,419
- Sure ain't no black man's book.
- What we reading this for?

1006
01:13:01,628 --> 01:13:04,297
Because the truth is lying there,
if you read behind the words.

1007
01:13:04,506 --> 01:13:08,635
You got to take everything the white man
says and use it against him.

1008
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:11,513
Yeah?

1009
01:13:13,098 --> 01:13:18,478
- I mean, there's a whole lot of words here.
- Here. Let's start at the beginning.

1010
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:22,982
We'll look them up, write them down
and find out what they mean. Here.

1011
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:26,277
Page one. The first word: "Aardvark."

1012
01:13:30,198 --> 01:13:31,324
"Aardvark.

1013
01:13:31,533 --> 01:13:34,452
Earth pig.
African, ant-eating mammal.

1014
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:36,329
Abacus:

1015
01:13:36,496 --> 01:13:40,166
Chinese calculating instrument.

1016
01:13:42,627 --> 01:13:43,753
Abaddon:

1017
01:13:43,962 --> 01:13:47,424
The place of the lost in Sheol.

1018
01:13:47,632 --> 01:13:49,008
The bottomless pit."

1019
01:13:49,217 --> 01:13:51,761
If you take one step toward Allah...

1020
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:53,972
...he'll take two steps toward you.

1021
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:00,186
Lights out!

1022
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:09,612
Lights out.

1023
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:37,599
Come on, Pete!

1024
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:41,519
Ha-ha-ha. Boy'll wear out a baseball.

1025
01:14:41,895 --> 01:14:44,439
- Chuck! What's the score, my man?
- 10 to 1.

1026
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:48,401
- We're murdering them! Didn't you hear?
- No. What happened?

1027
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:52,864
The Dodgers brought up Jackie Robinson!
We're pounding them, celebrating!

1028
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:54,782
Yeah, that's all right.

1029
01:14:55,408 --> 01:14:56,784
Sure.

1030
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:59,829
White man throw us a bone
and we're supposed to forget...

1031
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:01,956
...400 years of oppression.

1032
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:04,209
Yeah, but a nigger--

1033
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:07,712
A Negro in the big leagues,
that's something.

1034
01:15:07,879 --> 01:15:11,216
I told you to go behind the words
and dig out the truth.

1035
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:14,427
They let us sing and dance
and smile...

1036
01:15:14,928 --> 01:15:17,931
...and then they let one
so-called Negro into the majors.

1037
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:20,725
That doesn't cancel out history's
greatest crime.

1038
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:24,020
When that grafted, blue-eyed devil
locked us in chains...

1039
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:27,440
...one hundred million of us,
broke up our families...

1040
01:15:27,649 --> 01:15:29,067
...tortured us...

1041
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:33,112
...cut us off from our language,
our religion, our history.

1042
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:37,200
Let me tell you about black history.

1043
01:15:37,408 --> 01:15:39,994
We are the original man.

1044
01:15:40,203 --> 01:15:43,289
The first men on earth were black.
They ruled.

1045
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:46,292
And there wasn't
a white face anywhere.

1046
01:15:46,584 --> 01:15:49,128
But they teach us
that we swung from trees.

1047
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:52,632
That's a lie.
Black men never did that.

1048
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,426
We were a race of kings
when the white man...

1049
01:15:55,635 --> 01:15:57,720
...crawled on all fours in Europe.

1050
01:15:57,929 --> 01:15:59,973
Do they know who they are?

1051
01:16:01,975 --> 01:16:04,811
Do you know where you came from?
What's your name?

1052
01:16:05,019 --> 01:16:06,896
- Malcolm Little.
- No.

1053
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:10,316
That's the name of the slave masters
that owned your family.

1054
01:16:11,109 --> 01:16:13,111
You don't even know who you are.

1055
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:15,947
You're nothing.
Less than nothing.

1056
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:17,657
Who are you?

1057
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,371
Look, I ain't-- Shit, heh.

1058
01:16:27,542 --> 01:16:30,503
All right, I ain't Malcolm Little,
or Red, or Satan.

1059
01:16:30,712 --> 01:16:32,255
That's right. So who are you?

1060
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:39,220
- I don't know.
- We are a nation...

1061
01:16:39,596 --> 01:16:41,514
...the tribe of Shabazz...

1062
01:16:41,723 --> 01:16:45,351
...lost in this wilderness called
North America.

1063
01:16:53,026 --> 01:16:54,360
Tribe of Shabazz.

1064
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:56,988
The merciful Allah
has sent us a messenger...

1065
01:16:57,196 --> 01:16:59,449
...a black man
named Elijah Muhammad.

1066
01:16:59,907 --> 01:17:03,411
He reveals to us the true
knowledge about ourselves.

1067
01:17:03,703 --> 01:17:07,707
He teaches that the true nature
of the original man, the black man...

1068
01:17:07,915 --> 01:17:09,542
...is righteousness.

1069
01:17:10,001 --> 01:17:12,378
If the black man's nature
is righteousness....

1070
01:17:12,587 --> 01:17:15,340
Then the true nature of
the white man is wickedness.

1071
01:17:15,548 --> 01:17:17,091
I knew you'd get it.

1072
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:21,220
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches
that the white man is a devil.

1073
01:17:21,387 --> 01:17:23,890
I sure met some in my life.

1074
01:17:24,682 --> 01:17:25,725
No.

1075
01:17:25,892 --> 01:17:30,104
Elijah Muhammad does not say
that some white men are devils.

1076
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:33,941
He teaches us that
all white men are devils.

1077
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:38,738
Have you ever known a good white man?
Think back in all your life.

1078
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:42,241
Have you ever met one
who wasn't evil?

1079
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:52,043
<i>The body is a sacred temple...</i>

1080
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:54,504
<i>...it must be purified.</i>

1081
01:17:56,089 --> 01:17:58,925
I will not touch
the white man's poison:

1082
01:17:59,092 --> 01:18:00,510
His drugs...

1083
01:18:00,927 --> 01:18:02,428
...his liquor...

1084
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:05,598
...his swine...

1085
01:18:05,807 --> 01:18:06,933
...his women.

1086
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:10,436
A Muslim must be strikingly upright...

1087
01:18:10,645 --> 01:18:12,438
...an outstanding example...

1088
01:18:12,647 --> 01:18:16,109
...so that those in the darkness
can see the power of the light.

1089
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:21,489
I will not commit adultery or fornication.

1090
01:18:23,116 --> 01:18:24,742
I will not lie...

1091
01:18:24,951 --> 01:18:26,661
...cheat or steal.

1092
01:18:27,995 --> 01:18:30,456
But the key to Islam is submission.

1093
01:18:35,002 --> 01:18:38,464
That is why five times daily,
we turn to Mecca to pray...

1094
01:18:38,673 --> 01:18:41,175
...to bend our knees in submission.

1095
01:18:44,804 --> 01:18:47,140
I can't do that, Brother Baines.

1096
01:18:47,724 --> 01:18:49,934
The lost, found,
must bend their knees...

1097
01:18:50,143 --> 01:18:51,644
...to admit their guilt.

1098
01:18:51,811 --> 01:18:56,524
To implore Allah's forgiveness
is the hardest thing on earth.

1099
01:19:02,488 --> 01:19:04,824
The hardest and the greatest.

1100
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:12,498
I don't know
what I would say to Allah.

1101
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,501
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?

1102
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:20,339
Yes, when I was, uh...

1103
01:19:21,382 --> 01:19:23,885
When I was picking a lock
to rob someone's house.

1104
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:26,137
Tell Allah that.

1105
01:19:37,023 --> 01:19:41,027
You can grovel and crawl for sin
but not to save your soul?

1106
01:19:41,194 --> 01:19:43,237
Pick the lock, Malcolm. Pick it.

1107
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:45,531
I want to.

1108
01:19:49,202 --> 01:19:51,162
God knows I want to.

1109
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:05,885
<i>I received a letter that day
from the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.</i>

1110
01:20:06,177 --> 01:20:08,387
<i>The dear Holy Apostle wrote to me...</i>

1111
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:11,390
<i>...a nobody, a junkie,
a pimp and a convict.</i>

1112
01:20:11,599 --> 01:20:14,560
<i>I have come to give you...</i>

1113
01:20:15,019 --> 01:20:18,689
<i>...something which can
never be taken away from you.</i>

1114
01:20:18,898 --> 01:20:23,861
<i>I bring to you
a sense of your own worth...</i>

1115
01:20:24,695 --> 01:20:27,448
<i>...the worth of one human being.</i>

1116
01:20:27,657 --> 01:20:30,159
<i>The knowledge of self.</i>

1117
01:20:30,368 --> 01:20:31,828
<i>It was like a blinding light.</i>

1118
01:20:31,994 --> 01:20:34,664
<i>I became aware
that he was in the room with me.</i>

1119
01:20:35,206 --> 01:20:38,167
<i>He wore a dark suit,
and on his face I saw a wisdom...</i>

1120
01:20:38,376 --> 01:20:42,046
<i>...and pain so old and deep
that I could scarcely look at him.</i>

1121
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:45,800
<i>But I knew I wasn't dreaming.
He was there with me.</i>

1122
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:47,885
<i>I tell you...</i>

1123
01:20:49,262 --> 01:20:52,598
<i>...the most dangerous creation
in the world...</i>

1124
01:20:52,932 --> 01:20:55,226
<i>...in any society...</i>

1125
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:58,396
<i>...is the man with nothing to lose.</i>

1126
01:20:58,604 --> 01:21:03,568
<i>You do not need 10 such men
to change the world.</i>

1127
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:06,445
<i>One will do.</i>

1128
01:21:07,572 --> 01:21:10,449
<i>The earth belongs to us...</i>

1129
01:21:10,658 --> 01:21:12,076
<i>...the black man.</i>

1130
01:21:12,410 --> 01:21:14,787
<i>And whatever is around it...</i>

1131
01:21:14,954 --> 01:21:17,957
<i>...or on it, or in it...</i>

1132
01:21:18,249 --> 01:21:20,293
<i>...belongs to us.</i>

1133
01:21:20,459 --> 01:21:22,628
<i>And then as suddenly as he came...</i>

1134
01:21:22,837 --> 01:21:23,963
<i>...he was gone.</i>

1135
01:21:26,132 --> 01:21:27,675
<i>And then I could do it.</i>

1136
01:21:30,595 --> 01:21:31,888
<i>We're taught that Paul...</i>

1137
01:21:32,096 --> 01:21:35,474
<i>...on the road to Damascus,
heard the voice of Christ.</i>

1138
01:21:35,725 --> 01:21:38,686
<i>He was so smitten by the truth
that he fell from his horse.</i>

1139
01:21:38,895 --> 01:21:41,063
<i>Now, I don't liken myself to Paul...</i>

1140
01:21:41,314 --> 01:21:42,982
<i>...but I do understand.</i>

1141
01:21:44,567 --> 01:21:46,152
<i>You see, it happened to me.</i>

1142
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:47,445
Why me?

1143
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:53,910
I am back
in the bosom of Islam, praise Allah.

1144
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:57,455
<i>We don't have much,
but what we have is yours.</i>

1145
01:21:57,663 --> 01:22:01,542
<i>My wife and my son join me in saying
that when you come out...</i>

1146
01:22:01,751 --> 01:22:04,086
<i>...which won't be long,
come straight to us.</i>

1147
01:22:04,295 --> 01:22:05,671
Next.

1148
01:22:11,594 --> 01:22:13,095
What'll it be, Little?

1149
01:22:14,764 --> 01:22:16,182
Take it all off.

1150
01:22:16,349 --> 01:22:18,851
- Getting rid of that conk, huh?
- Yes, sir.

1151
01:22:20,353 --> 01:22:23,189
<i>You write, thanking me. Ha-ha-ha.</i>

1152
01:22:23,356 --> 01:22:27,610
<i>Don't thank me, thank Allah.
He did it all.</i>

1153
01:22:30,321 --> 01:22:31,948
<i>Dear Brother Baines:</i>

1154
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:35,868
<i>Please thank the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad for the money...</i>

1155
01:22:36,035 --> 01:22:38,371
<i>...and tell him I haven't written him...</i>

1156
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:40,539
<i>...because I've not yet proven myself.</i>

1157
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:44,961
<i>But I have shared his teachings
with some old running buddies in Harlem...</i>

1158
01:22:45,169 --> 01:22:48,589
<i>...and with my main man, Shorty,
who was transferred upstate.</i>

1159
01:22:48,798 --> 01:22:50,049
He's gone nuts.

1160
01:22:50,257 --> 01:22:51,717
"Dear Brothers:

1161
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:54,637
I thank you for your time and concern.

1162
01:22:55,554 --> 01:22:59,475
All praises due to Allah
for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

1163
01:22:59,809 --> 01:23:02,520
I wrote the mayor, the governor
and the president...

1164
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:06,023
...but for some reason,
I haven't heard from them."

1165
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,233
Hmm.

1166
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:09,443
<i>Please tell
the Honorable Elijah Muhammad...</i>

1167
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:13,739
<i>...that I have dedicated my life to telling
the white devil the truth to his face.</i>

1168
01:23:13,948 --> 01:23:18,035
<i>I greet you with the ancient words
of peace,</i> "As-Salaam-Alaikum."

1169
01:23:18,619 --> 01:23:21,872
<i>P.S. I finally copied out
the entire dictionary.</i>

1170
01:23:23,457 --> 01:23:26,585
I think the brother is coming along.

1171
01:23:28,254 --> 01:23:31,966
"The thief cometh not but for to steal...

1172
01:23:32,258 --> 01:23:35,928
...and to kill, and to destroy.

1173
01:23:36,262 --> 01:23:37,930
But I am come...

1174
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:40,224
...that they might have life...

1175
01:23:40,975 --> 01:23:44,478
...and that they might have it
more abundantly."

1176
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:49,775
Saint John 10, verse 10.
Are there any questions?

1177
01:23:54,113 --> 01:23:56,824
Watch it, baby.
This cat is heavy on religion.

1178
01:23:59,243 --> 01:24:01,996
I see this has become a struggle
between good and evil.

1179
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:03,497
"Satan" has a question.

1180
01:24:04,874 --> 01:24:07,209
Yes, sir. But since neither of us are God...

1181
01:24:07,418 --> 01:24:10,504
...neither of us can say
who's good and who's evil.

1182
01:24:10,713 --> 01:24:11,964
Just ask your question.

1183
01:24:12,131 --> 01:24:15,801
We were discussing the Disciples.
What color were they?

1184
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:18,512
Well, I don't think...

1185
01:24:18,971 --> 01:24:20,306
...we know for certain.

1186
01:24:20,514 --> 01:24:22,600
- But they were Hebrews?
- That's right.

1187
01:24:22,808 --> 01:24:24,852
As was Jesus.
Jesus was also a Hebrew.

1188
01:24:26,187 --> 01:24:27,605
Just ask your question.

1189
01:24:27,813 --> 01:24:29,231
What color were the Hebrews?

1190
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:32,902
I have told you that
we don't know that for certain.

1191
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:37,198
Then you can't believe for certain
that Jesus was white.

1192
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:39,700
Just a moment. Just a moment.

1193
01:24:40,868 --> 01:24:43,829
God is white. Isn't it obvious?

1194
01:24:44,038 --> 01:24:46,874
That's obvious,
but it's not obvious that God is white.

1195
01:24:47,041 --> 01:24:48,709
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
teaches us...

1196
01:24:48,876 --> 01:24:51,504
...that Jesus didn't have
blond hair and blue eyes.

1197
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:54,256
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
teaches that images of Jesus...

1198
01:24:54,465 --> 01:24:57,259
...in prisons and churches
throughout the world...

1199
01:24:57,468 --> 01:24:59,178
...are not historically correct.

1200
01:24:59,345 --> 01:25:01,055
Because history teaches us...

1201
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:04,433
...Jesus was born in a region where
the people had color.

1202
01:25:04,642 --> 01:25:07,186
There's proof in the Bible
you ask us to read...

1203
01:25:07,353 --> 01:25:10,231
...in Revelations, first chapter,
verses 14 and 15...

1204
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:12,358
...that Jesus had hair like wool...

1205
01:25:12,525 --> 01:25:14,360
...and feet the color of brass.

1206
01:25:14,527 --> 01:25:17,154
- What are you saying?
- I'm not saying anything.

1207
01:25:17,363 --> 01:25:21,325
I'm proving to you that Jesus was not,
to quote an Indian brother...

1208
01:25:21,534 --> 01:25:24,036
...he was not a paleface.

1209
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:27,456
- Ah-ha.
- Amen.

1210
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:29,208
Isn't that interesting.

1211
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:34,046
Brother Malcolm.

1212
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:35,714
Brother Malcolm.

1213
01:25:37,133 --> 01:25:39,218
He's waiting for you.

1214
01:26:23,971 --> 01:26:25,764
My son....

1215
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:31,604
You have been a thief...

1216
01:26:32,313 --> 01:26:35,149
...a drug dealer and a hustler...

1217
01:26:36,609 --> 01:26:39,612
...and the world
is still full of temptation.

1218
01:26:44,283 --> 01:26:48,954
When God spoke to the devil about
how faithful Job was...

1219
01:26:49,205 --> 01:26:50,497
...the devil argued...

1220
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:53,792
...that it was only
God's protective hedge around him...

1221
01:26:54,001 --> 01:26:56,378
...that kept him pure.

1222
01:26:56,962 --> 01:26:58,464
In fact, the devil said:

1223
01:26:58,672 --> 01:27:03,260
"Remove that hedge
and he will curse his Maker."

1224
01:27:04,845 --> 01:27:06,138
Well, Malcolm...

1225
01:27:07,848 --> 01:27:10,809
...your hedge has been removed.

1226
01:27:13,312 --> 01:27:16,982
And I believe...

1227
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:18,192
...you...

1228
01:27:19,151 --> 01:27:20,819
...will remain faithful.

1229
01:27:21,487 --> 01:27:22,821
Yes, sir.

1230
01:27:27,368 --> 01:27:30,162
Thank you, sister.
How many of these should we make?

1231
01:27:30,371 --> 01:27:32,414
- Five hundred.
- Make it 1000.

1232
01:27:32,581 --> 01:27:35,918
Brother Malcolm, this is Brother Earl.
He just accepted the teachings.

1233
01:27:37,711 --> 01:27:38,754
Yes, sir.

1234
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:41,715
Brother Earl's dedicated.
We need good men like him.

1235
01:27:42,049 --> 01:27:45,219
I'm a willing servant for
the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

1236
01:27:45,511 --> 01:27:47,346
Go ahead, brothers. Keep it busy.

1237
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:50,641
Take a real good look
at not just where you live...

1238
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:54,144
...but take a good look
at where everybody you know lives.

1239
01:27:54,353 --> 01:27:57,648
I don't want you to think
you're some bad-luck accident.

1240
01:27:57,856 --> 01:28:00,985
Then I want you to go downtown,
to Central Park West...

1241
01:28:01,151 --> 01:28:05,322
- ...and take a good look at how he lives.
- Go in other communities.

1242
01:28:05,531 --> 01:28:08,450
You've never seen
a Booker T. Washington linguine store...

1243
01:28:08,659 --> 01:28:10,077
...in an Italian community.

1244
01:28:10,286 --> 01:28:12,371
You've never went
in a Jewish community...

1245
01:28:12,538 --> 01:28:14,915
...and seen no
Frederick Douglass delicatessen.

1246
01:28:15,124 --> 01:28:18,669
Why's everybody in this community
making money but us?

1247
01:28:18,877 --> 01:28:21,880
It's time for the black man
and the woman to stand up...

1248
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:24,091
...and take control of our dollars.

1249
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:28,137
It's time for us to use our dollars
for our liberation.

1250
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:31,807
We can do what everyone else can do
if we become producers...

1251
01:28:32,016 --> 01:28:34,977
...and if we become
the masters of our own destiny.

1252
01:28:35,185 --> 01:28:37,896
We can have wool from sheep
just like anyone else.

1253
01:28:38,105 --> 01:28:40,024
But where are our clothing stores?

1254
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:44,528
We can get milk from cows,
but where are our grocery stores?

1255
01:28:44,737 --> 01:28:48,574
We need to control our dollars!
We need to control our destiny!

1256
01:28:48,782 --> 01:28:51,910
The only thing they respect
is our dollars!

1257
01:28:53,746 --> 01:28:56,415
--the so-called freedom
you and I should have.

1258
01:28:56,665 --> 01:28:58,834
The Statue of Liberty standing like this.

1259
01:28:59,043 --> 01:29:02,254
For us, it may as well say,
"Stop, don't come no further."

1260
01:29:02,421 --> 01:29:05,507
This is what he be saying,
"Don't come no further."

1261
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:10,220
What I want you to do, brothers and sisters,
I want you to come down to the temple.

1262
01:29:10,429 --> 01:29:12,097
Oh, I'm so surprised!

1263
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:15,017
I'm so surprised.
Y'all been in church two hours...

1264
01:29:15,184 --> 01:29:19,313
...and you're expecting to see heaven
out here, and you're still here on earth.

1265
01:29:19,521 --> 01:29:22,107
Why don't you come on down
to the temple at 2:00?

1266
01:29:22,316 --> 01:29:24,568
You'll hear truth,
the black man's truth.

1267
01:29:24,777 --> 01:29:28,655
No, you can't deny it. You been
on your knees for the last two hours...

1268
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:31,116
...begging some God to help you
in the hereafter.

1269
01:29:31,325 --> 01:29:34,870
But the hereafter is right now.
The hereafter is here and now.

1270
01:29:35,079 --> 01:29:36,789
Let me talk to you, brother.

1271
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:39,875
I know you're a smart man
and a wise man.

1272
01:29:40,084 --> 01:29:41,126
You look good.

1273
01:29:41,293 --> 01:29:44,671
Now, you're in church every day,
praying to this God.

1274
01:29:44,922 --> 01:29:46,965
But these so-called white Christians...

1275
01:29:47,174 --> 01:29:49,927
...they're hanging our black Christians
from trees.

1276
01:29:50,094 --> 01:29:53,389
This is the man that hates you.
He doesn't do anything for you.

1277
01:29:53,597 --> 01:29:55,933
He tells you to foam at
the mouth and sing...

1278
01:29:56,141 --> 01:29:59,978
...and hope for something in the hereafter.
We can have it right now.

1279
01:30:00,187 --> 01:30:02,439
- Come on down, 2:00.
- See you later.

1280
01:30:02,648 --> 01:30:05,859
<i>As-Salaam-Alaikum.</i>
That means, "Peace be unto you."

1281
01:30:06,068 --> 01:30:09,154
We have two children.
Carla, who's 2 1/2, and....

1282
01:30:09,321 --> 01:30:12,074
Don't be ashamed when I call you black.
You are.

1283
01:30:12,282 --> 01:30:15,285
You're black and you're beautiful.
Black is beautiful.

1284
01:30:15,494 --> 01:30:18,831
You don't have to come here
begging these folks for a job.

1285
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:22,000
You can wash their clothes
and scrub floors for them.

1286
01:30:22,209 --> 01:30:25,421
You can rock their little brats
to sleep the rest of your life.

1287
01:30:25,629 --> 01:30:27,172
You'll still end up poor.

1288
01:30:27,381 --> 01:30:30,384
Yet you're here on the auction block
being examined...

1289
01:30:30,592 --> 01:30:32,761
...like you're a horse or a slave.

1290
01:30:32,970 --> 01:30:36,014
You see this here?
This is who you are. Beautiful.

1291
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:39,810
Your beautiful black selves,
with pride and dignity.

1292
01:30:39,977 --> 01:30:41,728
In fact....

1293
01:30:42,396 --> 01:30:45,441
I'd also expect you to work one
Saturday every month...

1294
01:30:45,649 --> 01:30:48,360
...and occasionally in the evening--

1295
01:30:54,158 --> 01:30:58,036
See, these are the questions
you and I have to ask:

1296
01:30:58,203 --> 01:30:59,705
"How did we get this mind?"

1297
01:30:59,872 --> 01:31:03,709
You're not an American, but an African
who happens to be in America.

1298
01:31:04,001 --> 01:31:05,711
You have to understand the difference.

1299
01:31:05,919 --> 01:31:09,423
We didn't come over on the <i>Niña,</i>
the <i>Pinta</i> and the whatchamacallit.

1300
01:31:09,673 --> 01:31:13,427
We didn't land on Plymouth Rock.
Plymouth Rock landed on us.

1301
01:31:13,594 --> 01:31:16,346
- Yes!
- Landed right on top of us.

1302
01:31:18,891 --> 01:31:19,892
Shorty?

1303
01:31:21,018 --> 01:31:22,561
Is that you, brother?

1304
01:31:22,769 --> 01:31:26,732
Now, this is exactly what I'm talking
about, the slave mentality...

1305
01:31:26,899 --> 01:31:30,068
...the slave mind. This brother and I,
we had the slave mind.

1306
01:31:30,277 --> 01:31:33,197
We used to rob together.
We used to sleep with white women.

1307
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:35,073
We even went to prison together.

1308
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:38,285
Don't be surprised.
Some of you are still in prison...

1309
01:31:38,535 --> 01:31:39,912
...prisons of your mind.

1310
01:31:40,078 --> 01:31:42,164
Stand up, brother. Come on.

1311
01:31:42,331 --> 01:31:45,250
Ha-ha-ha. The brother's a little shy.

1312
01:31:45,417 --> 01:31:47,586
Come on, brother. Give me a hug.

1313
01:31:49,630 --> 01:31:52,508
That's all right, brother. That's all right.

1314
01:31:52,674 --> 01:31:54,635
Look, he's still got his hair fried.

1315
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:57,596
That's the slave mind.
That's the slave mind.

1316
01:31:57,804 --> 01:32:00,933
Red, that's the best preacher hype
I ever did hear.

1317
01:32:01,141 --> 01:32:03,018
No hype, brother. It's the truth.

1318
01:32:03,227 --> 01:32:05,270
Come back to the temple and hear more.

1319
01:32:05,479 --> 01:32:07,272
I can't pay that shit no mind.

1320
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:09,858
You need to pay it all your mind.
What mind you have left.

1321
01:32:10,067 --> 01:32:12,444
Take it easy. This is me. Shorty.

1322
01:32:12,653 --> 01:32:14,363
Let's go around the corner....

1323
01:32:15,906 --> 01:32:19,243
No, sir. Not anymore.
I've been clean for eight years.

1324
01:32:19,451 --> 01:32:21,078
- Eight years?
- Eight years.

1325
01:32:21,286 --> 01:32:25,290
My trouble is, I love pigs feet
and white women too much.

1326
01:32:25,582 --> 01:32:27,793
So I damn sure can't be no Muslim.

1327
01:32:28,001 --> 01:32:31,922
That's because you're lost, brother.
That's because you're lost.

1328
01:32:32,422 --> 01:32:34,091
But we can find you.

1329
01:32:38,345 --> 01:32:40,347
What do you hear about the old gang?

1330
01:32:40,931 --> 01:32:42,432
You heard about Sammy?

1331
01:32:42,724 --> 01:32:47,145
<i>Dead. Knocked over in bed with
a chick 25 years younger than he was.</i>

1332
01:32:47,354 --> 01:32:50,440
<i>Had 25 grand in his pocket, also.</i>

1333
01:32:51,233 --> 01:32:52,651
Guess it was his lucky number.

1334
01:32:52,818 --> 01:32:55,445
What about, uh...?

1335
01:32:55,654 --> 01:32:56,822
What was that brother's name?

1336
01:32:56,989 --> 01:32:58,490
<i>Cadillac?</i>

1337
01:32:58,657 --> 01:32:59,741
<i>Gone too?</i>

1338
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:04,121
<i>Hooked on heroin. Been in
and out of Lexington five or six times.</i>

1339
01:33:04,329 --> 01:33:07,749
- Sophia?
- Still happily married to that rich ofay.

1340
01:33:07,958 --> 01:33:10,127
<i>- She married him?</i>
<i>- She married him.</i>

1341
01:33:10,544 --> 01:33:12,045
<i>Went for the money.</i>

1342
01:33:12,337 --> 01:33:14,840
<i>- The money.</i>
- Thank you, honey.

1343
01:33:16,383 --> 01:33:18,176
I haven't seen West Indian Archie.

1344
01:33:18,385 --> 01:33:21,263
<i>Grapevine says he's living
somewhere in the Bronx.</i>

1345
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:23,348
<i>If you wanna call that living.</i>

1346
01:33:23,557 --> 01:33:27,144
<i>- It's been good seeing you.</i>
<i>- Same here, Red.</i>

1347
01:33:33,525 --> 01:33:38,238
Get the hell away from me, bitch!

1348
01:33:41,825 --> 01:33:44,244
I'll pay you tomorrow!

1349
01:33:58,759 --> 01:33:59,926
How you doing, Archie?

1350
01:34:00,427 --> 01:34:02,262
My man, Red.

1351
01:34:04,931 --> 01:34:06,433
Come here, man.

1352
01:34:10,771 --> 01:34:13,023
No, don't get up. It's all right.

1353
01:34:20,781 --> 01:34:22,115
Is...

1354
01:34:24,201 --> 01:34:26,036
...really you, Red?

1355
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:28,538
Yes, it's me.

1356
01:34:32,959 --> 01:34:34,711
I came to, uh....

1357
01:34:35,545 --> 01:34:37,130
Just to thank you...

1358
01:34:38,965 --> 01:34:40,676
...for saving my life.

1359
01:34:40,884 --> 01:34:44,513
When I think back to when we were
on the streets of Harlem trying...

1360
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:46,181
...to gun each other down--

1361
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:48,600
I wasn't going to shoot you, man.

1362
01:34:50,227 --> 01:34:51,269
It was...

1363
01:34:51,853 --> 01:34:53,397
...just my rep.

1364
01:34:54,314 --> 01:34:55,357
You know?

1365
01:34:56,775 --> 01:34:59,569
All I had was my rep.

1366
01:35:01,238 --> 01:35:02,322
But now...

1367
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:05,992
...you tell me this.

1368
01:35:06,493 --> 01:35:09,663
You did really have that number?

1369
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:13,333
I don't know, Archie....

1370
01:35:13,667 --> 01:35:15,711
I don't remember,
and it's not important.

1371
01:35:15,919 --> 01:35:19,756
The important thing now
is to get you back on your feet.

1372
01:35:21,174 --> 01:35:23,677
You know, I have some angles...

1373
01:35:25,637 --> 01:35:27,472
...ain't been figured yet.

1374
01:35:29,725 --> 01:35:32,269
- Unh--
- Oh.

1375
01:35:35,439 --> 01:35:36,565
It's all right.

1376
01:35:41,570 --> 01:35:43,613
Help me with my arm.

1377
01:35:45,073 --> 01:35:47,367
I need to exercise my arm.

1378
01:35:52,330 --> 01:35:53,665
Yeah.

1379
01:35:54,875 --> 01:35:56,168
That's better?

1380
01:35:56,376 --> 01:35:58,670
Yep. It feels good.

1381
01:35:58,837 --> 01:36:00,922
Good.

1382
01:36:04,968 --> 01:36:06,678
<i>What happened to our women?</i>

1383
01:36:06,845 --> 01:36:09,347
<i>Women who could've been doctors,
or lawyers...</i>

1384
01:36:09,556 --> 01:36:12,768
<i>...or teachers or mothers.
Who'll raise our children?</i>

1385
01:36:12,976 --> 01:36:14,519
<i>What happened to our men?</i>

1386
01:36:14,728 --> 01:36:18,940
<i>Men who could've been mathematicians,
electricians, uh, physicians.</i>

1387
01:36:19,149 --> 01:36:21,526
<i>What's the little boy gonna do...</i>

1388
01:36:21,693 --> 01:36:24,780
<i>...when he's looking for his father,
and his father's downtown in jail?</i>

1389
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:26,364
<i>What'll the little girl do...</i>

1390
01:36:26,573 --> 01:36:29,534
<i>...when she's looking for her mother,
and she's out there selling herself?</i>

1391
01:36:29,701 --> 01:36:30,702
Laura. Wait for me.

1392
01:36:30,869 --> 01:36:34,372
<i>I'm telling you, that devil
has made dead souls out of you and I.</i>

1393
01:36:34,539 --> 01:36:35,665
<i>You're dead.</i>

1394
01:36:35,832 --> 01:36:37,459
<i>You're dead, spiritually.</i>

1395
01:36:37,667 --> 01:36:41,379
<i>You're dead to the knowledge
of yourself and your people...</i>

1396
01:36:41,588 --> 01:36:43,632
<i>...and to the knowledge
of your God.</i>

1397
01:36:43,799 --> 01:36:47,219
<i>Why, my brothers and sisters,
he should get down on his knees.</i>

1398
01:36:47,427 --> 01:36:49,054
<i>He should beg our mercy.</i>

1399
01:36:49,221 --> 01:36:51,014
Oh, my brothers and sisters...

1400
01:36:51,223 --> 01:36:53,850
...his kind has committed
God's greatest crime...

1401
01:36:54,059 --> 01:36:57,562
...against your and my kind
every day of his life!

1402
01:36:57,771 --> 01:37:01,483
He should get on his knees
and say he's committed a crime.

1403
01:37:01,691 --> 01:37:02,734
But does he do that?

1404
01:37:02,943 --> 01:37:06,071
Does he do that?
No. No, he scorns you.

1405
01:37:06,279 --> 01:37:08,490
He splits your head with
his nightstick.

1406
01:37:08,698 --> 01:37:11,284
He busts you in the head
with that billy club.

1407
01:37:11,493 --> 01:37:13,161
And he calls you a nigger...

1408
01:37:13,370 --> 01:37:17,249
...calls you a coon. That's what he says
to you. "Boy!" "Nigger!"

1409
01:37:17,415 --> 01:37:19,417
Four hundred years is long enough.

1410
01:37:19,626 --> 01:37:23,088
You've sat down and laid down
and bowed down for 400 years.

1411
01:37:23,296 --> 01:37:27,008
I think it's time to stand up.
I think it's time to stand up.

1412
01:37:27,217 --> 01:37:29,052
- We're with you!
- All right.

1413
01:37:29,261 --> 01:37:32,055
- Bless you. Bless you.
- I'm with you.

1414
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:36,977
Come on up.

1415
01:37:37,185 --> 01:37:41,982
Glory! My Lord! Praise Him!
Praise Him! Praise Him!

1416
01:37:54,119 --> 01:37:55,954
Yes, sir. Next Wednesday, 8:00.

1417
01:37:56,162 --> 01:37:58,456
- I'll be there.
- I'll see you there.

1418
01:37:58,832 --> 01:38:00,876
Brother Baines? Excuse me, sister.

1419
01:38:01,084 --> 01:38:04,129
Do you think we can, uh,
get a loudspeaker set up outside?

1420
01:38:04,337 --> 01:38:05,589
I'm sure we can.

1421
01:38:05,797 --> 01:38:07,883
Brother Malcolm, this is Sister Betty.

1422
01:38:08,091 --> 01:38:10,802
She lectures our Muslim women
on hygiene and diet.

1423
01:38:11,011 --> 01:38:14,139
She stresses care for the body
and regular eating habits.

1424
01:38:14,431 --> 01:38:15,640
Good.

1425
01:38:15,807 --> 01:38:18,602
<i>- As-Salaam-Alaikum.
- Alaikum-Salaam</i>, sister.

1426
01:38:20,312 --> 01:38:21,813
Brother Minister...

1427
01:38:22,022 --> 01:38:25,483
...the sister wonders if you know
what Harriet Tubman did...

1428
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:28,653
...between taking souls
to the Promised Land?

1429
01:38:28,862 --> 01:38:31,114
Uh, no. What's that, sister?

1430
01:38:32,449 --> 01:38:33,867
She ate.

1431
01:38:37,287 --> 01:38:38,622
Excuse me.

1432
01:38:47,714 --> 01:38:48,840
She's interesting.

1433
01:38:49,049 --> 01:38:52,385
Minister, I was hoping
you'd come and speak to my class.

1434
01:38:52,552 --> 01:38:53,595
Yes.

1435
01:38:53,762 --> 01:38:55,555
Yes, I'll speak to your class.

1436
01:38:56,389 --> 01:38:59,184
- But I'm a hard man on the women.
- Are you?

1437
01:38:59,893 --> 01:39:02,437
We must be very careful
when it comes to women.

1438
01:39:02,646 --> 01:39:04,981
Too many of our women...

1439
01:39:06,024 --> 01:39:08,026
...have too much of the devil in them.

1440
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:10,570
Bleaching and dyeing...

1441
01:39:12,113 --> 01:39:14,407
...and ironing their hair.

1442
01:39:15,408 --> 01:39:19,454
Running around in the streets half-naked.

1443
01:39:21,539 --> 01:39:22,791
Talking too much.

1444
01:39:22,999 --> 01:39:24,626
Listening to the wrong men...

1445
01:39:24,834 --> 01:39:28,380
...making them deceitful,
untrustworthy, fresh.

1446
01:39:28,588 --> 01:39:30,924
And you men are to blame too.

1447
01:39:31,132 --> 01:39:35,011
We don't protect, we don't, uh, value,
we don't even support them.

1448
01:39:35,553 --> 01:39:40,183
See, the building of a new nation
begins with the woman.

1449
01:39:40,684 --> 01:39:42,435
Because the mother...

1450
01:39:42,852 --> 01:39:45,271
...is the first teacher of the child.

1451
01:39:45,438 --> 01:39:49,859
The message she gives that child, the child
gives to the world, so we have to be careful.

1452
01:39:50,026 --> 01:39:53,405
When it comes to choosing a mate...

1453
01:39:53,947 --> 01:39:58,326
...Samson, the strongest man
that ever lived, was destroyed...

1454
01:39:58,535 --> 01:40:01,037
...by the woman that slept in his arms.

1455
01:40:01,246 --> 01:40:03,707
Should I tell my sisters, then...

1456
01:40:03,957 --> 01:40:06,376
- ...that we don't believe in marriage?
- No.

1457
01:40:06,584 --> 01:40:09,170
No, we don't oppose marriage.

1458
01:40:09,379 --> 01:40:11,214
We're not Catholic priests.

1459
01:40:11,423 --> 01:40:13,174
We don't believe in celibacy.

1460
01:40:13,383 --> 01:40:15,635
Mr. Muhammad teaches
that if a woman...

1461
01:40:15,844 --> 01:40:18,596
...is, uh, the right height for a man,
right complexion....

1462
01:40:18,763 --> 01:40:20,098
If she's...

1463
01:40:20,348 --> 01:40:23,101
...half the man's age, plus seven.

1464
01:40:24,436 --> 01:40:25,937
And if...

1465
01:40:26,146 --> 01:40:30,775
...she understands that man's
essential nature is strong...

1466
01:40:31,109 --> 01:40:33,153
...and she's willing to support that.

1467
01:40:33,695 --> 01:40:35,238
And if she, uh...

1468
01:40:35,739 --> 01:40:38,158
...can sew and cook and...

1469
01:40:38,742 --> 01:40:39,993
...loves children...

1470
01:40:40,201 --> 01:40:42,245
...and stays out of trouble....

1471
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:45,540
I think you've made your points,
Brother Minister.

1472
01:40:45,749 --> 01:40:46,791
Good.

1473
01:40:46,958 --> 01:40:50,336
- You haven't any time for marriage.
- No. Ha, ha.

1474
01:40:51,171 --> 01:40:54,716
So, what I'll do is
write the chapters down for you...

1475
01:40:54,883 --> 01:40:55,925
All right.

1476
01:40:56,092 --> 01:40:59,387
...as well as the New Testament
chapters in St. Matthew.

1477
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:00,972
Brother Minister...

1478
01:41:01,181 --> 01:41:03,975
...I hope that doesn't mean
you won't come visit my class, though.

1479
01:41:04,142 --> 01:41:07,145
Oh, no. No, I'd love to come to your class.
I love to teach.

1480
01:41:07,479 --> 01:41:10,982
I love sharing. This is the wonderful
thing about Mr. Muhammad:

1481
01:41:11,191 --> 01:41:15,987
When he gives you this knowledge,
you can't help but to run out and share it--

1482
01:41:16,154 --> 01:41:18,490
Excuse me, um, Brother Minister...

1483
01:41:18,698 --> 01:41:20,408
...would it be okay if we...

1484
01:41:20,617 --> 01:41:22,494
...just sat down for a moment?

1485
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:26,414
- It's a pretty big building and, uh, ha....
- Oh, yes.

1486
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:29,501
Sister, I'm sorry.
I've had you on your feet all day.

1487
01:41:29,667 --> 01:41:31,002
Oh, no. No, no.

1488
01:41:31,169 --> 01:41:32,337
My mistake.

1489
01:41:32,545 --> 01:41:34,798
You've been on your feet for days.

1490
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:40,261
And, uh, you didn't even finish your salad.

1491
01:41:41,805 --> 01:41:44,182
- So let's talk about you.
- Mm.

1492
01:41:44,766 --> 01:41:46,059
How tall are you?

1493
01:41:47,644 --> 01:41:48,812
Why do you ask?

1494
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:50,688
- Idle question.
- Oh.

1495
01:41:50,855 --> 01:41:55,193
Well, if it's just an idle question,
I hope you won't force me to answer.

1496
01:41:56,194 --> 01:41:58,863
No, I won't force you.

1497
01:42:02,117 --> 01:42:03,451
Well....

1498
01:42:03,910 --> 01:42:07,539
Brother Baines says that
I'm tall enough for a tall man.

1499
01:42:07,705 --> 01:42:11,084
He's briefed you also? Ha-ha-ha.

1500
01:42:11,835 --> 01:42:13,378
How old are you, sister?

1501
01:42:14,212 --> 01:42:17,465
You know, there are
a few things about women...

1502
01:42:17,674 --> 01:42:19,676
...that you don't understand.

1503
01:42:19,884 --> 01:42:23,179
Some of us,
we're quite possessive, very vain...

1504
01:42:23,388 --> 01:42:24,389
Are you?

1505
01:42:24,556 --> 01:42:27,225
...and persistent when
we've set our mind to something.

1506
01:42:27,767 --> 01:42:30,228
What have you set your mind to?

1507
01:42:32,397 --> 01:42:34,107
Being a good Muslim...

1508
01:42:34,941 --> 01:42:36,693
...a good nurse...

1509
01:42:38,444 --> 01:42:40,029
...and a good wife.

1510
01:42:40,947 --> 01:42:42,240
Brother Malcolm?

1511
01:42:42,448 --> 01:42:43,992
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.

1512
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:46,828
Brother Johnson was attacked
by the police.

1513
01:42:48,746 --> 01:42:49,789
Excuse me.

1514
01:42:49,956 --> 01:42:51,833
- A scuffle.
- He was just watching.

1515
01:42:52,041 --> 01:42:55,336
- The cop said, "Move on!"
- He didn't move quick enough for him.

1516
01:42:55,545 --> 01:42:57,755
Crack! He was bleeding
like a stuck hog.

1517
01:42:57,964 --> 01:43:00,133
So, what you gonna do?

1518
01:43:00,842 --> 01:43:03,761
He'll rap a little. He's a Muslim!

1519
01:43:03,928 --> 01:43:06,890
But you ain't gonna do nothing
but make a speech.

1520
01:43:07,348 --> 01:43:10,602
Muslims talk a good game,
but they never do nothing...

1521
01:43:11,102 --> 01:43:13,813
...unless somebody bothers Muslims.

1522
01:43:34,626 --> 01:43:36,377
We demand to see Brother Johnson.

1523
01:43:36,586 --> 01:43:40,465
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm the minister from Muslim Temple No. 7.

1524
01:43:40,673 --> 01:43:42,342
Never heard of you.

1525
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:44,052
- Where is he?
- Not here.

1526
01:43:44,260 --> 01:43:46,471
Wait a second. What is your name?

1527
01:43:46,679 --> 01:43:48,973
Don't worry about what my name is.

1528
01:43:49,182 --> 01:43:52,977
Two witnesses saw Johnson brought here
beat up, but not brought out.

1529
01:43:53,144 --> 01:43:56,314
You didn't hear the sergeant?
Outside!

1530
01:43:56,481 --> 01:43:59,025
I suggest you look outside
that window.

1531
01:44:10,328 --> 01:44:14,457
- Jimmy, come here a second.
- Yes, we intend to see Brother Johnson.

1532
01:44:15,250 --> 01:44:16,417
Who the hell are they?

1533
01:44:16,626 --> 01:44:19,003
They're brothers of Brother Johnson.

1534
01:44:23,091 --> 01:44:25,593
Eddie, let me take a look
at that blotter.

1535
01:44:31,557 --> 01:44:32,976
Ah....

1536
01:44:34,394 --> 01:44:37,605
Yeah. We got a Muslim.
Relief must've put it down.

1537
01:44:37,814 --> 01:44:40,191
- Must have.
- But you can't see him.

1538
01:44:40,358 --> 01:44:42,944
- Because you ain't his lawyer.
- No lawyer, no see.

1539
01:44:43,152 --> 01:44:47,532
Until I'm satisfied that Brother Johnson
is receiving proper medical care...

1540
01:44:47,699 --> 01:44:49,367
...nobody will move.

1541
01:45:04,424 --> 01:45:06,384
Get an ambulance. Now!

1542
01:45:25,069 --> 01:45:27,155
Break it up. You got what you wanted.

1543
01:45:27,363 --> 01:45:29,824
No, I'm not satisfied.

1544
01:45:30,867 --> 01:45:32,702
To the hospital.

1545
01:46:05,818 --> 01:46:07,028
Suzie, come on.

1546
01:47:31,529 --> 01:47:34,699
<i>We want justice! We want justice!</i>

1547
01:47:35,366 --> 01:47:36,868
All right, that's enough.

1548
01:47:37,034 --> 01:47:38,703
Move these people out of here.

1549
01:47:38,911 --> 01:47:43,416
Fruit of Islam are disciplined men.
They haven't broken any laws...yet.

1550
01:47:43,624 --> 01:47:46,335
- What about them?
- That's your headache, captain.

1551
01:47:46,544 --> 01:47:48,754
But if Brother Johnson dies,
I pity you.

1552
01:47:50,089 --> 01:47:51,174
Doctor?

1553
01:47:51,382 --> 01:47:53,843
He'll live.
He's getting the best care we have.

1554
01:47:54,051 --> 01:47:55,178
- Thank you.
- Certainly.

1555
01:47:56,304 --> 01:47:57,972
All right, okay.

1556
01:47:58,389 --> 01:48:00,057
Now, let's disperse this mob!

1557
01:48:00,808 --> 01:48:04,395
<i>We want justice! We want justice!</i>

1558
01:48:52,902 --> 01:48:55,738
That's too much power
for one man to have.

1559
01:48:56,030 --> 01:48:59,075
Brother Minister,
I'm ready to take some heads.

1560
01:48:59,242 --> 01:49:01,494
We gotta do something
to put fear in those devils.

1561
01:49:01,702 --> 01:49:05,957
I'm ready to do something also.
The word out of Chicago was to be patient.

1562
01:49:06,165 --> 01:49:09,043
- I'm tired of being patient.
- Then you get on the phone--

1563
01:49:09,835 --> 01:49:12,588
You get on the phone, call Chicago
and let Mr. Muhammad know.

1564
01:49:30,356 --> 01:49:31,816
Have a seat, son.

1565
01:49:35,486 --> 01:49:37,738
The only thing I like integrated...

1566
01:49:39,240 --> 01:49:40,992
...is my coffee.

1567
01:49:42,243 --> 01:49:43,786
What can I do for you?

1568
01:49:47,123 --> 01:49:48,749
Well, Mr. X...

1569
01:49:50,126 --> 01:49:51,752
...my name is Benjamin.

1570
01:49:52,336 --> 01:49:54,338
I was out there tonight.

1571
01:49:54,839 --> 01:49:56,257
Take it easy, now.

1572
01:49:56,632 --> 01:49:59,093
And I saw what it is that you did.

1573
01:49:59,302 --> 01:50:02,054
The way you talked
to them policeman and all.

1574
01:50:06,434 --> 01:50:07,935
Well, Mr. X...

1575
01:50:10,521 --> 01:50:12,398
...I want to be a Muslim.

1576
01:50:12,773 --> 01:50:15,526
I ain't never seen a nigger--
I mean...

1577
01:50:15,776 --> 01:50:17,111
...colored person--

1578
01:50:19,030 --> 01:50:20,114
Negro...

1579
01:50:21,115 --> 01:50:23,409
...talk to no police like that before.

1580
01:50:23,618 --> 01:50:26,537
And you want to be a Muslim?
Join the Nation Of Islam?

1581
01:50:26,746 --> 01:50:29,665
You know what that means?
To be a Muslim?

1582
01:50:31,751 --> 01:50:32,877
Do you?

1583
01:50:35,379 --> 01:50:39,425
Mm-- No, not exactly.
But I wanna be one...

1584
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:40,885
...just like you.

1585
01:50:41,052 --> 01:50:45,431
You shouldn't join any organization
unless you know exactly what it's about.

1586
01:50:51,729 --> 01:50:53,022
Thank you.

1587
01:50:54,690 --> 01:50:57,026
You shouldn't give up so easily either.

1588
01:50:59,070 --> 01:51:02,323
We could use more young warriors
like yourself.

1589
01:51:02,573 --> 01:51:04,992
Come on by the temple
next Wednesday, 8:00.

1590
01:51:05,242 --> 01:51:06,410
8:00 sharp.

1591
01:51:06,619 --> 01:51:08,454
Yes, sir. 8:00 sharp.

1592
01:51:08,663 --> 01:51:11,957
Thank you, Mr. X. And I won't
make you out a liar either.

1593
01:51:12,166 --> 01:51:14,377
No, I don't think you will.

1594
01:51:24,804 --> 01:51:28,015
Tonight, I shall...

1595
01:51:28,516 --> 01:51:32,478
...introduce you
as my national minister.

1596
01:51:33,729 --> 01:51:36,190
It will be a difficult task.

1597
01:51:36,607 --> 01:51:38,192
Your assignment...

1598
01:51:39,026 --> 01:51:41,696
...is to build temples all over this nation.

1599
01:51:42,780 --> 01:51:44,907
More work than you've ever done.

1600
01:51:45,116 --> 01:51:46,158
- Yes, sir.
- Ha, ha.

1601
01:51:46,367 --> 01:51:48,411
You will be in the public eye.

1602
01:51:48,619 --> 01:51:51,247
Beware of them cameras.

1603
01:51:52,957 --> 01:51:54,959
Oh, them cameras...

1604
01:51:55,710 --> 01:51:57,962
...are bad as any narcotic.

1605
01:51:59,463 --> 01:52:00,798
Yeah.

1606
01:52:00,965 --> 01:52:03,592
White devil will be watching
your every step.

1607
01:52:04,218 --> 01:52:06,679
And your own brothers will be...

1608
01:52:07,805 --> 01:52:09,223
...jealous...

1609
01:52:09,890 --> 01:52:11,642
...hostile.

1610
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:13,853
Go slowly.

1611
01:52:14,145 --> 01:52:15,312
Yes, sir.

1612
01:52:16,647 --> 01:52:18,065
Here's a glass.

1613
01:52:24,864 --> 01:52:26,824
It's dirty water.

1614
01:52:27,032 --> 01:52:28,159
Foul.

1615
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:32,371
If you offer this to the people...

1616
01:52:32,580 --> 01:52:34,415
...they have no choice.

1617
01:52:34,832 --> 01:52:36,333
They'll drink from it...

1618
01:52:37,293 --> 01:52:39,670
- ...if they're thirsty.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1619
01:52:39,837 --> 01:52:41,630
But if you offer them...

1620
01:52:42,423 --> 01:52:44,133
...this glass...

1621
01:52:46,927 --> 01:52:50,181
...and let them make
their own decision...

1622
01:52:51,015 --> 01:52:54,268
...they will choose the pure vessel.

1623
01:52:56,270 --> 01:52:57,730
Islam...

1624
01:52:58,189 --> 01:53:00,441
...is the only religion...

1625
01:53:01,609 --> 01:53:04,737
...that addresses
the needs and the problems...

1626
01:53:04,945 --> 01:53:06,947
...of the so-called Negro in America.

1627
01:53:07,114 --> 01:53:09,200
- Especially in the slums...
- Right.

1628
01:53:09,366 --> 01:53:10,785
...ghettos.

1629
01:53:11,494 --> 01:53:15,581
Islam is the only way out
for drugs and crime...

1630
01:53:15,790 --> 01:53:18,000
...unemployment, prostitution...

1631
01:53:18,209 --> 01:53:19,835
...alcohol...

1632
01:53:20,044 --> 01:53:21,420
...gambling...

1633
01:53:21,629 --> 01:53:23,881
...and adultery, fornication.

1634
01:53:25,216 --> 01:53:27,510
<i>This sweet gentle man...</i>

1635
01:53:27,676 --> 01:53:30,888
<i>...at whose feet I kneeled
gave me the truth from his own mouth.</i>

1636
01:53:31,055 --> 01:53:32,598
Present them the pure vessel.

1637
01:53:32,765 --> 01:53:36,894
<i>I adored him in the sense
of the Latin root of the word</i> adorare...

1638
01:53:37,061 --> 01:53:39,146
<i>...which means to worship and to fear.</i>

1639
01:53:39,688 --> 01:53:41,524
<i>He was the first man I ever feared.</i>

1640
01:53:41,732 --> 01:53:44,360
<i>I don't mean fear
such as one has of a gun...</i>

1641
01:53:44,568 --> 01:53:48,364
<i>...but the fear one has
of the power of the sun.</i>

1642
01:53:48,656 --> 01:53:51,909
<i>I pledged myself to him,
even if it cost me my life.</i>

1643
01:53:54,995 --> 01:53:56,580
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello, Betty?

1644
01:53:56,747 --> 01:53:58,749
<i>- Yes?</i>
- Yeah, this is Malcolm.

1645
01:53:59,124 --> 01:54:01,794
- I know.
<i>- Right, I'm here in Detroit.</i>

1646
01:54:05,923 --> 01:54:08,050
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.

1647
01:54:08,425 --> 01:54:09,885
<i>You heard what I said, right?</i>

1648
01:54:10,094 --> 01:54:12,471
<i>- Did you hear my answer?</i>
- Yes, I think so.

1649
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:14,932
- Brother Malcolm...
- Ha-ha-ha.

1650
01:54:15,099 --> 01:54:17,434
<i>- ...are you eating?</i>
- Yeah, I've been eating.

1651
01:54:17,601 --> 01:54:18,978
<i>Ha, good.</i>

1652
01:54:19,728 --> 01:54:21,105
<i>I love you, Betty.</i>

1653
01:54:23,691 --> 01:54:25,693
<i>I love you back.</i>

1654
01:54:35,995 --> 01:54:37,371
It's not gonna be easy.

1655
01:54:37,580 --> 01:54:39,123
No choice.

1656
01:54:39,623 --> 01:54:41,208
I'll be away a lot.

1657
01:54:42,042 --> 01:54:43,294
I know.

1658
01:54:46,130 --> 01:54:47,882
In fact, I'm leaving in the morning.

1659
01:54:48,048 --> 01:54:50,467
Oh, hush, now. Shh.

1660
01:54:50,634 --> 01:54:52,803
Pittsburgh, Philadelphia...

1661
01:54:54,555 --> 01:54:57,224
...Trenton, Newark,
up through number 7 up to Boston.

1662
01:54:57,391 --> 01:54:58,726
Malcolm.

1663
01:54:59,894 --> 01:55:01,645
Shh.

1664
01:55:04,982 --> 01:55:06,692
You're with me...

1665
01:55:07,985 --> 01:55:09,987
...even when you're away.

1666
01:55:26,503 --> 01:55:28,839
I've never told you this...

1667
01:55:31,425 --> 01:55:34,261
...but the very first time
I ever saw you...

1668
01:55:35,346 --> 01:55:37,431
...standing up on the podium...

1669
01:55:40,017 --> 01:55:42,269
...you were cleaning your glasses...

1670
01:55:44,939 --> 01:55:47,691
...and I felt so sorry for you.

1671
01:55:48,609 --> 01:55:50,194
- Sorry for me?
- Mm-hm.

1672
01:55:50,361 --> 01:55:51,403
Why?

1673
01:55:51,570 --> 01:55:56,116
Because no one as young as you
should be so serious.

1674
01:55:59,078 --> 01:56:01,121
But I don't think that anymore.

1675
01:56:01,747 --> 01:56:03,123
What do you think?

1676
01:56:06,126 --> 01:56:09,046
I want to have a lot of babies with you.

1677
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:14,301
Dear heart.

1678
01:56:17,012 --> 01:56:18,305
I love you.

1679
01:56:20,557 --> 01:56:23,435
We're waiting on you folks.
Trying to starve us?

1680
01:56:26,897 --> 01:56:29,024
Brother Malcolm, Sister Betty...

1681
01:56:29,233 --> 01:56:33,737
...we pray that Allah blesses you
with a happy and fruitful marriage.

1682
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:39,076
Congratulations, Brother Minister.

1683
01:56:39,243 --> 01:56:41,245
- Congratulations.
- Front page.

1684
01:56:41,412 --> 01:56:43,664
Check them out. Front page!

1685
01:56:48,210 --> 01:56:49,837
I must emphasize at the out start...

1686
01:56:50,004 --> 01:56:53,048
...that the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad is not a politician.

1687
01:56:53,674 --> 01:56:57,594
So I'm not here this afternoon
as a Republican nor as a Democrat.

1688
01:56:57,761 --> 01:56:59,596
Tell it, brother!

1689
01:57:00,097 --> 01:57:03,934
- Not as a Mason nor as an Elk.
- Well, tell us what you're here for!

1690
01:57:04,101 --> 01:57:06,812
Not as a Protestant nor a Catholic.

1691
01:57:07,021 --> 01:57:09,732
Not as a Christian nor a Jew.

1692
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:12,276
Not as a Baptist nor a Methodist.

1693
01:57:12,443 --> 01:57:14,278
In fact, not even as an American.

1694
01:57:15,738 --> 01:57:17,698
Because if I was an American...

1695
01:57:17,948 --> 01:57:20,784
...the problem that confronts our people
today wouldn't even exist.

1696
01:57:22,453 --> 01:57:24,788
So now we ain't Americans, huh?

1697
01:57:24,955 --> 01:57:28,417
So I have to stand here today
as what I was when I was born...

1698
01:57:28,709 --> 01:57:29,918
...a black man.

1699
01:57:34,882 --> 01:57:39,595
Before there was any such thing as a
Republican or a Democrat, we were black.

1700
01:57:39,803 --> 01:57:43,599
Before there was any such thing
as a Mason or an Elk, we were black.

1701
01:57:43,807 --> 01:57:48,020
Before there was any such thing as a Jew
or a Christian, we were black people.

1702
01:57:48,228 --> 01:57:52,608
In fact, before there was any such place
as America, we were black.

1703
01:57:52,858 --> 01:57:56,361
And after America has long passed
from the scene...

1704
01:57:56,570 --> 01:57:58,155
...there will still be black people.

1705
01:58:00,074 --> 01:58:02,743
I'm gonna tell you like it really is!

1706
01:58:03,494 --> 01:58:08,290
Every election year, these politicians
are sent up here to pacify us.

1707
01:58:08,499 --> 01:58:11,293
They're sent here and set up here
by the white man.

1708
01:58:11,502 --> 01:58:12,795
This is what they do.

1709
01:58:13,003 --> 01:58:15,881
They send drugs in Harlem down here
to pacify us!

1710
01:58:16,090 --> 01:58:18,801
They send alcohol down here
to pacify us!

1711
01:58:19,009 --> 01:58:21,970
They send prostitution down here
to pacify us!

1712
01:58:22,179 --> 01:58:25,557
You can't get drugs in Harlem
without the white man's permission.

1713
01:58:25,724 --> 01:58:29,061
You can't get prostitution in Harlem
without the white man's permission.

1714
01:58:29,269 --> 01:58:32,439
You can't get gambling in Harlem
without the white man's permission.

1715
01:58:32,648 --> 01:58:35,484
Every time you break the seal
on that liquor bottle...

1716
01:58:35,692 --> 01:58:38,237
...that's a government seal
you're breaking.

1717
01:58:38,445 --> 01:58:42,324
So I say, and I say it again,
you been had.

1718
01:58:42,533 --> 01:58:44,034
You been took.

1719
01:58:44,243 --> 01:58:45,869
You been hoodwinked.

1720
01:58:46,203 --> 01:58:48,789
Bamboozled. Led astray.

1721
01:58:49,039 --> 01:58:51,542
Run amuck. This is what he does.

1722
01:58:51,792 --> 01:58:54,503
You know, some people
call this hate-teaching.

1723
01:58:54,837 --> 01:58:56,797
- This isn't hate-teaching.
- That's right.

1724
01:58:57,005 --> 01:58:58,048
This is love-teaching.

1725
01:58:59,424 --> 01:59:01,760
I wouldn't tell you this
if I didn't love you.

1726
01:59:01,969 --> 01:59:04,763
I wouldn't stick my neck out for you
if I didn't love you.

1727
01:59:04,972 --> 01:59:07,850
I want you to understand one thing:
Everything I teach you...

1728
01:59:08,058 --> 01:59:10,102
...everything I have said to you...

1729
01:59:10,310 --> 01:59:13,313
...has been taught to me
by this dear man.

1730
01:59:13,564 --> 01:59:14,857
This divine man.

1731
01:59:16,650 --> 01:59:19,903
All praise is due to Allah
for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

1732
01:59:20,571 --> 01:59:22,406
<i>Attallah's fine.</i>

1733
01:59:22,573 --> 01:59:25,159
<i>And she misses you as much as I do.</i>

1734
01:59:25,576 --> 01:59:29,788
<i>But the news that you've dedicated
four new temples is almost as good...</i>

1735
01:59:29,997 --> 01:59:34,001
<i>...as having you with us.
Oh, dear heart, please take care of yourself.</i>

1736
01:59:34,168 --> 01:59:36,170
<i>white people try to hide their guilt...</i>

1737
01:59:36,336 --> 01:59:38,380
<i>...by accusing
the Honorable Elijah Muhammad...</i>

1738
01:59:38,589 --> 01:59:40,215
<i>...of being a black supremacist...</i>

1739
01:59:40,424 --> 01:59:43,218
<i>...simply because he's trying
to uplift the mentality...</i>

1740
01:59:43,427 --> 01:59:46,263
<i>...the social and economic condition
of his people.</i>

1741
01:59:46,430 --> 01:59:50,559
<i>And the Jews who have been guilty
of exploiting black people...</i>

1742
01:59:50,767 --> 01:59:54,021
<i>...try to hide their guilt by accusing
the Honorable Elijah Muhammad...</i>

1743
01:59:54,271 --> 01:59:56,315
<i>...of being anti-Semitic...</i>

1744
01:59:56,523 --> 01:59:59,943
...simply because he's trying
to teach you and I--

1745
02:00:00,110 --> 02:00:02,112
<i>He's trying to teach you and I...</i>

1746
02:00:02,321 --> 02:00:05,490
<i>...to be in charge of the businesses
in our own community.</i>

1747
02:00:05,699 --> 02:00:08,410
<i>To own the businesses
in our own community.</i>

1748
02:00:08,619 --> 02:00:10,787
<i>To have economic leadership
in our own community.</i>

1749
02:00:10,954 --> 02:00:14,082
<i>No! No, this isn't black supremacy...</i>

1750
02:00:14,291 --> 02:00:16,001
<i>...this is black intelligence.</i>

1751
02:00:33,518 --> 02:00:35,812
<i>The black people in this country...</i>

1752
02:00:36,230 --> 02:00:38,649
<i>...have been the victims of violence...</i>

1753
02:00:39,149 --> 02:00:41,735
<i>...at the hands
of the American white man...</i>

1754
02:00:41,944 --> 02:00:45,072
<i>...for 400 years.</i>

1755
02:00:45,489 --> 02:00:47,574
<i>Four hundred years.</i>

1756
02:00:48,158 --> 02:00:49,910
<i>Four hundred years.</i>

1757
02:00:52,204 --> 02:00:55,332
<i>We thought by following
those ignorant Negro preachers...</i>

1758
02:00:55,499 --> 02:00:58,001
<i>...that it was God-like
to turn the other cheek...</i>

1759
02:00:58,168 --> 02:01:00,671
<i>...to the group that was brutalizing us.</i>

1760
02:01:01,088 --> 02:01:04,800
A hundred years ago,
they used to put on white sheets...

1761
02:01:05,008 --> 02:01:07,135
...and sic bloodhounds on us.

1762
02:01:07,344 --> 02:01:09,721
Nowadays, they've traded in the sheets--

1763
02:01:09,930 --> 02:01:11,682
Some have traded in the sheets--

1764
02:01:13,058 --> 02:01:15,060
<i>They've traded in the sheets--</i>

1765
02:01:15,269 --> 02:01:16,645
<i>Please, please.</i>

1766
02:01:16,853 --> 02:01:20,190
<i>They've traded in those white sheets
for police uniforms.</i>

1767
02:01:20,524 --> 02:01:23,610
<i>They traded in the bloodhounds
for police dogs.</i>

1768
02:01:23,819 --> 02:01:26,488
<i>And just like Uncle Tom
back during slavery time....</i>

1769
02:01:26,697 --> 02:01:31,201
<i>We must remain true to nonviolence.
I'm asking everybody in the line.</i>

1770
02:01:31,535 --> 02:01:34,121
<i>If you can't be nonviolent,
don't get in it.</i>

1771
02:01:34,329 --> 02:01:37,332
--to love our enemy and pray
for those who use us spitefully.

1772
02:01:37,541 --> 02:01:41,712
You've got chicken-pecking Uncle Tom,
so-called Negro leaders today.

1773
02:01:41,878 --> 02:01:44,006
<i>And it's another great day.</i>

1774
02:01:44,214 --> 02:01:47,968
<i>You've got these Uncle Tom
Negro leaders today...</i>

1775
02:01:48,176 --> 02:01:50,762
<i>...that tell us we ought to pray
for our enemies.</i>

1776
02:01:50,971 --> 02:01:54,057
<i>We ought to love our enemy
and integrate with the enemy...</i>

1777
02:01:54,224 --> 02:01:57,853
<i>...who bombs us, who kills
and shoots us, who lynches us...</i>

1778
02:01:58,061 --> 02:02:00,939
<i>...who rapes our women
and children. No!</i>

1779
02:02:01,398 --> 02:02:03,150
<i>No!</i>

1780
02:02:03,317 --> 02:02:05,402
<i>No! That's not intelligent.</i>

1781
02:02:05,652 --> 02:02:07,446
<i>That's not intelligent.</i>

1782
02:02:07,654 --> 02:02:10,365
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
is trying to teach you and I...

1783
02:02:10,574 --> 02:02:13,910
...that just as the white man
and any other man on this earth...

1784
02:02:14,077 --> 02:02:17,539
...has the God-given right,
the human right, the civil right...

1785
02:02:17,748 --> 02:02:20,667
...the natural right, and any other
rights you can think of...

1786
02:02:20,917 --> 02:02:22,627
...to protect himself...

1787
02:02:22,836 --> 02:02:26,423
...just as this white man has
the right to defend himself...

1788
02:02:26,673 --> 02:02:29,426
...we have the right
to defend ourselves too.

1789
02:02:29,968 --> 02:02:31,261
This is only natural.

1790
02:02:31,428 --> 02:02:34,348
This is what the Honorable Elijah
Muhammad is trying to teach you and I.

1791
02:02:34,556 --> 02:02:36,558
He's not teaching us
to hate the white man.

1792
02:02:36,767 --> 02:02:39,269
He's teaching us to love ourselves.

1793
02:02:40,437 --> 02:02:44,441
<i>Mr. X, uh, before we begin
our discussion tonight...</i>

1794
02:02:44,649 --> 02:02:47,986
<i>..."The Black Muslims: Hate Mongers"...</i>

1795
02:02:48,695 --> 02:02:52,282
<i>...would you mind explaining for us
the meaning of your name...</i>

1796
02:02:52,449 --> 02:02:54,618
<i>...which is the letter "X"?</i>

1797
02:02:54,785 --> 02:02:58,413
Yes, uh, during slavery time,
the slave master...

1798
02:02:58,622 --> 02:03:01,124
...gave the Negro-- So-called Negro--

1799
02:03:01,333 --> 02:03:04,503
Named the so-called Negro
after themselves.

1800
02:03:05,629 --> 02:03:07,339
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
teaches us...

1801
02:03:07,547 --> 02:03:11,259
...that once we come into the knowledge
of Islam, the knowledge of ourselves...

1802
02:03:11,468 --> 02:03:14,096
...we replace our slave name
with an "X"...

1803
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:17,182
..."X" in mathematics representing
the unknown.

1804
02:03:17,474 --> 02:03:20,560
Since we've been disconnected,
or cut off from our own history...

1805
02:03:20,769 --> 02:03:23,730
...our own past, our own culture,
our own land...

1806
02:03:23,939 --> 02:03:27,651
...we use the "X," the unknown,
until we get back to our country.

1807
02:03:27,859 --> 02:03:31,154
I see. Thank you. Uh, Dr. Payson?

1808
02:03:31,321 --> 02:03:33,990
Mr. X is a....
He's a demagogue.

1809
02:03:34,199 --> 02:03:36,993
He has no place to go,
so he exaggerates.

1810
02:03:37,202 --> 02:03:39,204
He's a disservice to every good...

1811
02:03:39,371 --> 02:03:42,499
...law-abiding, church-going
American Negro in the country.

1812
02:03:43,834 --> 02:03:45,710
Mr. Malcolm X...

1813
02:03:46,545 --> 02:03:49,673
...why do you teach black supremacy?

1814
02:03:49,881 --> 02:03:51,842
Why--? Why do you teach hate?

1815
02:03:52,008 --> 02:03:54,511
Well, for the white man...

1816
02:03:54,678 --> 02:03:57,180
...to ask the black man...

1817
02:03:57,681 --> 02:03:59,099
...why he hates him...

1818
02:03:59,349 --> 02:04:03,228
...is like the wolf asking the sheep,
or the rapist asking the raped...

1819
02:04:03,437 --> 02:04:04,479
..."Do you hate me?"

1820
02:04:04,688 --> 02:04:08,316
The white man is in no moral position
to accuse the black man of anything.

1821
02:04:08,525 --> 02:04:10,485
<i>This is a black man asking the question.</i>

1822
02:04:10,694 --> 02:04:14,865
<i>What would you call an educated Negro
with a B.A., an M.A., a B.S. or a Ph.D.?</i>

1823
02:04:15,031 --> 02:04:18,535
You call him a nigger.
That's what the white man calls him.

1824
02:04:18,702 --> 02:04:20,912
You have to understand this thinking.

1825
02:04:21,121 --> 02:04:24,749
To understand this type of man,
you must understand that historically...

1826
02:04:24,958 --> 02:04:28,628
...there were two types of slaves:
the house Negro and the field Negro.

1827
02:04:28,837 --> 02:04:30,630
The house Negro lived in the house...

1828
02:04:30,839 --> 02:04:34,509
...next to his master, in the big house,
in the basement or the attic.

1829
02:04:34,718 --> 02:04:37,471
He dressed good, he ate good,
what the master left him.

1830
02:04:37,679 --> 02:04:39,306
He loved his master.

1831
02:04:39,514 --> 02:04:42,726
He loved his master better
than the master loved himself.

1832
02:04:42,893 --> 02:04:47,230
If master said, "We got a nice house,"
you say, "Yeah, boss, we got a nice house."

1833
02:04:47,564 --> 02:04:49,983
Master's house caught on fire,
the house Negro...

1834
02:04:50,150 --> 02:04:51,693
...would put the blaze out.

1835
02:04:51,860 --> 02:04:55,447
If the master got sick, he'd say,
"What's the matter, boss? We sick?"

1836
02:04:55,614 --> 02:04:58,283
"We sick"!
This is the thinking of the house Negro.

1837
02:04:58,492 --> 02:05:00,076
If another slave said to him:

1838
02:05:00,243 --> 02:05:03,288
"Let's run away, let's separate
from this cruel master"...

1839
02:05:03,497 --> 02:05:06,416
...he said, "Why? What's better
than what we got here?

1840
02:05:06,625 --> 02:05:08,960
I'm not going anywhere."
This is the house Negro.

1841
02:05:09,127 --> 02:05:11,129
In those days,
we called them house niggers.

1842
02:05:11,296 --> 02:05:15,383
That's what we call them today
because we still got a lot of house niggers.

1843
02:05:16,301 --> 02:05:17,469
Dear Holy Apostle...

1844
02:05:19,304 --> 02:05:22,599
...the ministers think Malcolm
is getting too much press.

1845
02:05:23,892 --> 02:05:26,520
They think he thinks
he is the Nation of Islam.

1846
02:05:28,396 --> 02:05:31,066
That he has aspirations
to lead the Nation.

1847
02:05:32,108 --> 02:05:35,028
It was you who made Malcolm
the man he is.

1848
02:05:35,237 --> 02:05:36,738
You lifted him out of darkness.

1849
02:05:36,905 --> 02:05:38,532
You....

1850
02:05:40,325 --> 02:05:42,953
You go and tell the brothers...

1851
02:05:43,703 --> 02:05:45,455
...that what the Brother Minister...

1852
02:05:45,789 --> 02:05:47,666
...is doing, has done...

1853
02:05:47,958 --> 02:05:52,379
...has been of great benefit
to the Nation.

1854
02:05:52,587 --> 02:05:54,589
And you tell them that I say so.

1855
02:05:54,798 --> 02:05:57,425
The ministers think he is
of great benefit to himself.

1856
02:06:06,977 --> 02:06:08,061
One at a time.

1857
02:06:08,270 --> 02:06:10,146
<i>Did you say white people are devils?</i>

1858
02:06:10,313 --> 02:06:11,314
<i>I said they're devils.</i>

1859
02:06:11,523 --> 02:06:13,316
<i>Should all blacks be armed, sir?</i>

1860
02:06:13,483 --> 02:06:15,860
Well, one of your most
famous men said:

1861
02:06:16,069 --> 02:06:19,614
"Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition."
That's the way you think.

1862
02:06:19,823 --> 02:06:22,158
<i>Do you think your cause will be successful?</i>

1863
02:06:22,325 --> 02:06:23,660
<i>I sincerely hope so.</i>

1864
02:06:23,868 --> 02:06:26,162
- Do you advocate violence?
- No, sir.

1865
02:06:26,371 --> 02:06:28,582
Has a white man helped your people?

1866
02:06:28,790 --> 02:06:31,334
<i>Has there been a white man
that's helped my people?</i>

1867
02:06:31,543 --> 02:06:33,753
<i>- Correct.
- I don't understand the question.</i>

1868
02:06:33,962 --> 02:06:36,131
<i>You preach anti-white,
anti-Christian science.</i>

1869
02:06:36,339 --> 02:06:38,216
You're saying you're anti-white?

1870
02:06:38,425 --> 02:06:41,386
- No, you're saying it.
- Are all white people devils?

1871
02:06:42,012 --> 02:06:45,181
<i>We've gotta move out.
We've got a plane to catch.</i>

1872
02:06:48,059 --> 02:06:50,937
Excuse me, Mr. X? Um....

1873
02:06:51,104 --> 02:06:53,023
I've read some of your speeches...

1874
02:06:53,189 --> 02:06:56,943
...and I honestly believe that a lot
of what you have to say is true.

1875
02:06:57,152 --> 02:07:00,196
I'm a good person in spite
of what my ancestors did.

1876
02:07:00,405 --> 02:07:02,490
I just wanted to ask you...

1877
02:07:02,699 --> 02:07:05,535
...what can a white person like me,
who isn't prejudiced...

1878
02:07:05,744 --> 02:07:09,331
...what can I do to help you
and further your cause?

1879
02:07:09,539 --> 02:07:10,624
Nothing.

1880
02:07:18,173 --> 02:07:20,550
<i>My high school was a black ghetto...</i>

1881
02:07:20,759 --> 02:07:22,927
<i>...in Roxbury, right here in Boston.</i>

1882
02:07:23,762 --> 02:07:27,390
<i>I got my college education on
the streets of Harlem in New York City.</i>

1883
02:07:28,224 --> 02:07:32,729
I took my master's degree in prison,
over the course of 6 1/2 years.

1884
02:07:32,937 --> 02:07:34,189
In fact...

1885
02:07:34,397 --> 02:07:38,068
...my old burglary hangout
was just outside this campus.

1886
02:07:38,818 --> 02:07:40,278
I lived like an animal.

1887
02:07:41,237 --> 02:07:42,614
I stole.

1888
02:07:42,947 --> 02:07:44,741
I used drugs.

1889
02:07:45,742 --> 02:07:48,787
I smoked reefers, cocaine.

1890
02:07:48,995 --> 02:07:52,791
I committed adultery. Had it not been
for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad...

1891
02:07:53,583 --> 02:07:56,419
...I'd have surely been in
an insane asylum or dead...

1892
02:07:56,586 --> 02:07:59,339
...or possibly even a murderer
of one of you.

1893
02:07:59,547 --> 02:08:03,760
So, what is Mr. Muhammad trying to do?
He's trying to get us on God's side...

1894
02:08:04,010 --> 02:08:07,681
...so that God will be on our side
and help us fight our battles.

1895
02:08:07,889 --> 02:08:10,725
When the so-called Negro in America
gets on God's side...

1896
02:08:10,892 --> 02:08:13,520
...and listens to the teachings
of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad...

1897
02:08:13,728 --> 02:08:17,148
...he'll want to get off of drugs
and get away from a life of crime.

1898
02:08:17,357 --> 02:08:20,026
He'll want to get away
from committing adultery.

1899
02:08:20,235 --> 02:08:23,113
Then he'd want to get off welfare.
He'd want a job...

1900
02:08:23,321 --> 02:08:26,908
...to take care of his family.
And his family would respect him.

1901
02:08:27,117 --> 02:08:29,577
His son will say,
"I'm proud that that's my father."

1902
02:08:29,786 --> 02:08:32,497
His wife will say,
"I'm proud that that's my husband."

1903
02:08:32,706 --> 02:08:37,335
"Father" only means that you're taking care
of your children. That's what it is.

1904
02:08:37,544 --> 02:08:40,547
"Father" doesn't mean
that you're having some babies.

1905
02:08:40,755 --> 02:08:44,300
That doesn't make you a father.
Anybody can go out and get a woman.

1906
02:08:44,467 --> 02:08:47,470
But not anybody can take care
of that woman.

1907
02:08:47,637 --> 02:08:50,390
There's another word for it.
It's called "responsibility."

1908
02:08:50,974 --> 02:08:55,437
If the so-called Negro in America
was truly an American citizen...

1909
02:08:55,645 --> 02:08:57,647
...we wouldn't have a racial problem.

1910
02:08:57,814 --> 02:09:00,900
If the Emancipation Proclamation was
authentic, we wouldn't have a race problem.

1911
02:09:01,401 --> 02:09:03,695
If the 13th,
14th and 15th amendments...

1912
02:09:03,903 --> 02:09:06,656
...were authentic,
we wouldn't have a race problem.

1913
02:09:06,865 --> 02:09:09,826
If the Supreme Court desegregation
decision were authentic...

1914
02:09:10,034 --> 02:09:12,120
...we wouldn't have a race problem.

1915
02:09:12,287 --> 02:09:15,290
But you have to see
that all of this is hypocrisy.

1916
02:09:15,498 --> 02:09:18,209
These Negro leaders are telling
the white man...

1917
02:09:18,418 --> 02:09:21,254
...that everything's all right,
we got it under control.

1918
02:09:21,463 --> 02:09:24,132
That everything the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad teaches is wrong.

1919
02:09:24,340 --> 02:09:27,844
Mr. Muhammad said these things
were gonna come to pass...

1920
02:09:28,011 --> 02:09:30,847
...and now this things
are starting to come to pass.

1921
02:09:32,682 --> 02:09:35,393
Now these same Negro leaders...

1922
02:09:36,519 --> 02:09:41,191
...are running around talking about
there's about to be a racial explosion.

1923
02:09:43,067 --> 02:09:45,695
Yes, there's gonna be
a racial explosion.

1924
02:09:46,154 --> 02:09:49,866
And a racial explosion is
more dangerous than an atomic explosion.

1925
02:09:52,368 --> 02:09:56,498
There's going to be an explosion because
black people are dissatisfied...

1926
02:09:56,706 --> 02:10:00,877
...not only with the white man,
but with these Uncle Tom Negro leaders...

1927
02:10:01,085 --> 02:10:04,631
...that are trying to pose as spokesmen
for you and I.

1928
02:10:05,048 --> 02:10:06,257
Just like you have a--

1929
02:10:07,050 --> 02:10:08,802
Just like you have a powder keg.

1930
02:10:09,135 --> 02:10:11,763
When you have a powder keg
and there's too many sparks...

1931
02:10:11,930 --> 02:10:13,556
...the thing's going to explode.

1932
02:10:13,723 --> 02:10:17,519
If the thing that's going to explode
is sitting inside the house...

1933
02:10:17,727 --> 02:10:20,730
...and if it explodes, then the house
is going to be destroyed.

1934
02:10:20,897 --> 02:10:23,733
I said the house is going
to be destroyed.

1935
02:10:23,942 --> 02:10:26,528
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
is teaching you and I...

1936
02:10:26,736 --> 02:10:30,698
...and trying to tell the white man
to get this powder keg out of his house.

1937
02:10:31,032 --> 02:10:33,368
Let the black man separate
from his house.

1938
02:10:33,576 --> 02:10:35,578
Let the black man have his own house.

1939
02:10:35,745 --> 02:10:38,540
Let the black man have
his own land and property.

1940
02:10:41,417 --> 02:10:44,420
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
is trying to tell the white man...

1941
02:10:44,629 --> 02:10:48,591
...that this thing, this explosion,
is gonna bring down his house.

1942
02:10:48,758 --> 02:10:52,262
This is what he's telling him.
More importantly, he's telling him...

1943
02:10:52,428 --> 02:10:54,597
...that if he doesn't do
something about it...

1944
02:10:54,764 --> 02:10:58,560
...if he doesn't do something about it,
it's gonna explode any day now.

1945
02:10:58,726 --> 02:11:00,144
Yes it is.

1946
02:11:00,311 --> 02:11:03,189
I'm just here to tell you,
and I'm gonna make it very short.

1947
02:11:03,731 --> 02:11:07,652
I'm here to tell you about the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad's greatest greatness.

1948
02:11:07,986 --> 02:11:11,239
His greatest greatness is
that he has the only solution...

1949
02:11:11,447 --> 02:11:13,491
...for peace in this country.

1950
02:11:13,950 --> 02:11:16,452
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad's
solution...

1951
02:11:16,619 --> 02:11:18,788
...is the only solution for you and I.

1952
02:11:18,955 --> 02:11:21,624
It's the only solution for the white man.

1953
02:11:22,834 --> 02:11:25,295
Complete separation...

1954
02:11:25,628 --> 02:11:29,090
...between the black race
and the white race.

1955
02:11:31,718 --> 02:11:33,595
It's the only solution.

1956
02:11:39,976 --> 02:11:42,312
<i>All praise due to Allah
for Elijah Muhammad!</i>

1957
02:11:42,478 --> 02:11:44,731
<i>All praise due to Allah
for Elijah Muhammad!</i>

1958
02:12:20,558 --> 02:12:22,352
Brother Malcolm!

1959
02:12:23,186 --> 02:12:25,897
Yes, yes. Hold on, hold on.

1960
02:12:26,731 --> 02:12:30,026
Yes, sir. It's all right.
My brother. How you doing?

1961
02:12:30,234 --> 02:12:32,320
- Can I ask you something?
- Anything.

1962
02:12:32,528 --> 02:12:34,322
Are you Elijah's pimp?

1963
02:12:34,530 --> 02:12:38,242
- He should be killed talking like that!
- Hold it. Hold on.

1964
02:12:38,451 --> 02:12:40,036
What are you saying, brother?

1965
02:12:40,536 --> 02:12:42,163
"His greatest greatness."

1966
02:12:42,372 --> 02:12:44,123
Just say what you're saying.

1967
02:12:45,917 --> 02:12:47,627
If you don't know...

1968
02:12:47,961 --> 02:12:49,420
...I feel the sorriest for you.

1969
02:12:49,587 --> 02:12:51,589
Oh, come on, brother.

1970
02:12:52,757 --> 02:12:54,592
- Let me tell you something--
- No. Let me tell--

1971
02:13:03,643 --> 02:13:04,936
It's all right.

1972
02:13:05,937 --> 02:13:07,647
It's all right.

1973
02:13:09,065 --> 02:13:11,567
He's just hungry for knowledge,
that's all.

1974
02:13:11,776 --> 02:13:14,112
Yeah, that brother's starving. Ha, ha.

1975
02:13:14,278 --> 02:13:18,032
So am I. Come on,
let's get something to eat. Ha-ha-ha.

1976
02:13:18,658 --> 02:13:20,201
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

1977
02:13:20,410 --> 02:13:22,912
- Okay, night-night, Daddy.
- Night-night.

1978
02:13:38,469 --> 02:13:39,679
Long night.

1979
02:13:43,808 --> 02:13:45,143
Oh, yeah.

1980
02:13:46,894 --> 02:13:48,688
- What you looking at?
- You.

1981
02:13:48,896 --> 02:13:52,775
- Why you looking at me like that?
- Because you're in trouble.

1982
02:13:54,068 --> 02:13:57,321
- How do you know that?
- Oh, dear heart.

1983
02:13:57,947 --> 02:13:59,282
Because I know you.

1984
02:13:59,449 --> 02:14:01,159
Well, if you know me...

1985
02:14:02,994 --> 02:14:06,789
...you know that I don't like to bring
my troubles into my house.

1986
02:14:07,498 --> 02:14:09,000
You know that also.

1987
02:14:11,836 --> 02:14:14,172
- Yes, I do.
- Okay.

1988
02:14:15,465 --> 02:14:17,550
But I'm not made of glass.

1989
02:14:17,759 --> 02:14:19,761
And I won't break.

1990
02:14:27,226 --> 02:14:29,479
Look, Betty, I just want peace.

1991
02:14:30,980 --> 02:14:33,274
I want to sit here with you.
I want to...

1992
02:14:34,567 --> 02:14:37,653
...be still. I want peace in my house.

1993
02:14:41,324 --> 02:14:44,035
- Have we ever had a fight?
- Never.

1994
02:14:44,243 --> 02:14:46,621
- Argument?
- Never had one, no.

1995
02:14:49,457 --> 02:14:51,125
We're gonna have one...

1996
02:14:52,251 --> 02:14:55,338
- ...right now if you don't talk about it.
- Talk about what?

1997
02:14:55,505 --> 02:14:59,509
- The talk's everywhere.
- There's always gonna be talk.

1998
02:14:59,717 --> 02:15:03,054
Aren't they talking now about me trying
to take over the Nation?

1999
02:15:03,346 --> 02:15:06,390
Aren't they talking about
how we're getting rich...

2000
02:15:06,599 --> 02:15:08,434
...off the Nation of Islam?

2001
02:15:08,643 --> 02:15:11,395
- We could talk about that too.
- Let's talk about it.

2002
02:15:11,813 --> 02:15:13,606
It's not just talk anymore.

2003
02:15:13,815 --> 02:15:17,110
Elijah Muhammad...

2004
02:15:17,276 --> 02:15:20,196
...67-year-old leader
of the Black Muslim movement...

2005
02:15:20,363 --> 02:15:24,700
...today faced paternity suits
from two former secretaries."

2006
02:15:24,909 --> 02:15:28,329
These are slanders. These are lies.
Don't you realize that?

2007
02:15:28,538 --> 02:15:32,583
Don't you realize whose newspaper this is.
This is the devil's newspaper.

2008
02:15:32,917 --> 02:15:35,002
He's trying to divide us.

2009
02:15:35,503 --> 02:15:39,674
Don't you see that? Divide and conquer.
He's trying to bring down our leader.

2010
02:15:43,094 --> 02:15:44,428
"Both women...

2011
02:15:45,263 --> 02:15:48,891
...in their 20s,
charge that they had intimacy--"

2012
02:15:49,100 --> 02:15:51,978
"Intimacies with Mr. Muhammad."

2013
02:16:00,236 --> 02:16:04,240
You think I'm not
aware of these accusations?

2014
02:16:04,448 --> 02:16:07,785
You think I'm not
aware of these vicious lies?

2015
02:16:09,912 --> 02:16:12,373
Brother Baines and I discussed it today.

2016
02:16:12,540 --> 02:16:16,002
- Baines? Is he your friend?
- What's the matter with you?

2017
02:16:16,210 --> 02:16:18,671
Nothing.
What's the matter with you?

2018
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:22,425
Wake up! Are you so committed
that you've blinded yourself?

2019
02:16:22,633 --> 02:16:25,428
You're so dedicated,
you can't face the truth?

2020
02:16:25,636 --> 02:16:26,929
Baines?

2021
02:16:27,138 --> 02:16:30,600
He's the editor of the newspaper
that you established.

2022
02:16:30,808 --> 02:16:35,104
Ask him why your name hasn't appeared
in <i>Muhammad Speaks</i> in over a year.

2023
02:16:35,313 --> 02:16:38,733
- I'm not interested in publicity.
- You're in every other paper.

2024
02:16:38,900 --> 02:16:42,612
- Not one single sentence in your own.
- Our people know what I'm doing.

2025
02:16:42,778 --> 02:16:46,532
- But do you know what Baines is doing?
- What is this Baines? Baines!

2026
02:16:46,699 --> 02:16:49,827
You're so blind!
Everyone can see this but you!

2027
02:16:51,495 --> 02:16:54,957
Baines is the one who saved my life.

2028
02:16:55,124 --> 02:16:57,460
When I crawled in prison
like an animal...

2029
02:16:57,627 --> 02:17:00,296
...he brought me to
the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

2030
02:17:00,463 --> 02:17:03,090
And the Honorable Elijah Muhammad
brought me back from the dead--

2031
02:17:03,299 --> 02:17:05,301
A long time ago! You've repaid them!

2032
02:17:05,509 --> 02:17:08,221
Don't you raise your voice
in my house!

2033
02:17:12,683 --> 02:17:14,185
Ask them.

2034
02:17:15,686 --> 02:17:18,481
Ask them why they have new cars,
houses and furniture.

2035
02:17:18,689 --> 02:17:21,484
Is that what this is about?
You want new furniture?

2036
02:17:21,651 --> 02:17:23,778
- You want some cars?
- What do we have?

2037
02:17:23,986 --> 02:17:25,988
What do we have, Malcolm?

2038
02:17:26,322 --> 02:17:28,324
Broken-down jalopy....

2039
02:17:29,408 --> 02:17:31,410
The clothes on our backs.

2040
02:17:31,577 --> 02:17:33,412
You want new clothes?
I'll get you new clothes.

2041
02:17:33,621 --> 02:17:36,123
We don't even own our own home.

2042
02:17:36,332 --> 02:17:39,252
What about our children?
What about me?

2043
02:17:39,627 --> 02:17:41,629
You don't even own life insurance.

2044
02:17:41,837 --> 02:17:45,174
The Nation will provide for you
if anything happens to me--

2045
02:17:45,383 --> 02:17:46,425
Will they?

2046
02:17:47,551 --> 02:17:48,844
Are you sure?

2047
02:17:50,388 --> 02:17:51,722
Are you sure?

2048
02:17:52,723 --> 02:17:54,058
Are you sure?

2049
02:17:55,726 --> 02:17:57,395
Or are you blind?

2050
02:18:00,982 --> 02:18:02,316
All right.

2051
02:18:05,695 --> 02:18:07,321
Um....

2052
02:18:07,863 --> 02:18:09,740
I've got work to do, so....

2053
02:18:11,409 --> 02:18:13,411
There's always work to do.

2054
02:18:13,703 --> 02:18:15,496
- Help me.
- I'm trying to.

2055
02:18:15,705 --> 02:18:17,665
I'm raising our children
practically by myself.

2056
02:18:17,832 --> 02:18:19,208
And what am I doing?

2057
02:18:19,417 --> 02:18:22,044
What do you want me to do?
Stay home?

2058
02:18:22,253 --> 02:18:25,715
You don't know how often they ask,
"Where's Daddy? I want Daddy."

2059
02:18:25,881 --> 02:18:28,551
You want me to make the beds
and go on the road?

2060
02:18:28,759 --> 02:18:30,511
- The people need me!
- We need you!

2061
02:18:30,720 --> 02:18:33,389
I need you too.
But what do you want me to do?

2062
02:18:33,597 --> 02:18:35,725
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

2063
02:18:36,559 --> 02:18:40,896
You can face death 24 hours a day,
but the possibility of betrayal...

2064
02:18:41,147 --> 02:18:43,274
...never enters your head.

2065
02:18:46,569 --> 02:18:48,446
Open your eyes.

2066
02:19:25,024 --> 02:19:27,943
<i>- As-Salaam-Alaikum,</i> minister.
<i>- Alaikum-Salaam,</i> sister.

2067
02:19:28,110 --> 02:19:30,112
Her name's Eva Marie.

2068
02:19:31,113 --> 02:19:32,698
And she's 2 years old.

2069
02:19:34,283 --> 02:19:37,036
Brother Minister,
I didn't do anything wrong.

2070
02:19:37,286 --> 02:19:40,373
I didn't do anything to be
put in isolation.

2071
02:19:41,540 --> 02:19:43,376
I believed in him.

2072
02:19:44,794 --> 02:19:48,214
I believed in
the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

2073
02:19:49,882 --> 02:19:51,467
Believe in Allah.

2074
02:19:56,055 --> 02:19:58,307
This is Saudi. She's 2.

2075
02:19:58,641 --> 02:20:00,601
And you have Lisha. She's 3.

2076
02:20:00,810 --> 02:20:05,523
<i>From their own mouths,
I heard who had fathered their children.</i>

2077
02:20:06,065 --> 02:20:08,984
<i>And from their own mouths I heard
that the Honorable Elijah Muhammad...</i>

2078
02:20:09,151 --> 02:20:11,946
<i>- ...had told them I was his best.</i>
- He often spoke of you.

2079
02:20:12,113 --> 02:20:14,657
He loves you like you were his own son.

2080
02:20:14,907 --> 02:20:18,035
<i>The greatest minister he had,
but that I would leave him...</i>

2081
02:20:18,244 --> 02:20:21,497
<i>...turn against him.
And so I was dangerous.</i>

2082
02:20:21,705 --> 02:20:24,375
<i>The Honorable Elijah Muhammad,
while praising me to my face...</i>

2083
02:20:24,542 --> 02:20:26,043
And he said that about me?

2084
02:20:26,210 --> 02:20:28,504
<i>...was tearing me apart behind my back.</i>

2085
02:20:28,754 --> 02:20:31,048
- You're sure about all this?
- Yes, I am.

2086
02:20:31,298 --> 02:20:34,009
All I want is support for
my three children...

2087
02:20:34,427 --> 02:20:37,513
...that the Honorable Elijah Muhammad
provide for them.

2088
02:20:37,847 --> 02:20:39,557
That's all I want.

2089
02:20:42,017 --> 02:20:44,061
Allah will provide...

2090
02:20:47,690 --> 02:20:48,732
...for all of us.

2091
02:20:49,066 --> 02:20:54,113
What are you talking about, blackout?
Perhaps some brothers are a little jealous.

2092
02:20:54,280 --> 02:20:57,491
Maybe they think you've been
getting too much press.

2093
02:20:57,700 --> 02:20:59,326
It's nothing. Forget it.

2094
02:20:59,535 --> 02:21:02,079
Now, about our coming up
in the world a little.

2095
02:21:02,288 --> 02:21:05,291
The Nation's grown. We've grown with it.

2096
02:21:06,250 --> 02:21:07,793
You know our people.

2097
02:21:09,295 --> 02:21:11,589
They want their leaders
to be prosperous.

2098
02:21:12,715 --> 02:21:14,508
One hand washes the other.

2099
02:21:15,092 --> 02:21:18,304
"I'm telling you God's words,
not no hustle."

2100
02:21:20,764 --> 02:21:22,850
Remember what you told me in prison?

2101
02:21:23,058 --> 02:21:26,896
"I'm telling you God's words,
not no hustle."

2102
02:21:28,814 --> 02:21:30,065
Brother Malcolm...

2103
02:21:33,068 --> 02:21:35,446
...what do you want? A new car?

2104
02:21:36,071 --> 02:21:37,490
A new house?

2105
02:21:39,033 --> 02:21:40,659
It's the money, isn't it?

2106
02:21:45,748 --> 02:21:49,627
But we tell the whole world that
we're moral leaders...

2107
02:21:49,960 --> 02:21:51,754
...because we follow...

2108
02:21:52,421 --> 02:21:55,007
...the personal example of
the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

2109
02:21:55,216 --> 02:21:57,343
Elijah Muhammad is a human being...

2110
02:21:58,260 --> 02:21:59,512
...and so are you.

2111
02:22:00,429 --> 02:22:02,431
- Do you know your Bible?
- Do you?

2112
02:22:02,598 --> 02:22:04,517
David slept with Bathsheba...

2113
02:22:04,725 --> 02:22:07,102
...but he's remembered
for slaying Goliath.

2114
02:22:08,771 --> 02:22:12,775
Noah was accused of drunkenness,
but God gave him the ark.

2115
02:22:14,068 --> 02:22:18,739
Solomon had 700 wives, but he
was history's greatest, wisest king.

2116
02:22:18,948 --> 02:22:22,660
Brother Baines is a two-bit hustler,
but one hand washes the other.

2117
02:22:22,868 --> 02:22:25,788
A great man's deeds
outweigh his personal weaknesses.

2118
02:22:25,996 --> 02:22:28,332
Who needs the nutmeg now, brother?

2119
02:22:28,541 --> 02:22:31,085
- I'm not gonna allow--
- Be careful, Malcolm.

2120
02:22:33,045 --> 02:22:34,463
I warn you.

2121
02:22:35,464 --> 02:22:36,674
You be careful.

2122
02:23:06,036 --> 02:23:08,122
I'm not surprised.

2123
02:23:11,292 --> 02:23:16,171
You have a very good understanding
of prophecy, of spiritual matters.

2124
02:23:16,380 --> 02:23:18,465
I'm not surprised.

2125
02:23:19,049 --> 02:23:21,760
I have built this Nation...

2126
02:23:21,969 --> 02:23:25,264
...under the divine guidance of Allah.

2127
02:23:26,056 --> 02:23:30,019
He has brought me back
from the dead to lead my people.

2128
02:23:30,185 --> 02:23:32,605
After me, there will be no more.

2129
02:23:32,813 --> 02:23:34,565
No more.

2130
02:23:38,569 --> 02:23:40,404
I must...

2131
02:23:42,406 --> 02:23:45,701
...plant my seed in fertile soil.

2132
02:23:45,909 --> 02:23:47,369
It is only...

2133
02:23:48,037 --> 02:23:51,040
...the fulfillment of prophecy.

2134
02:23:51,415 --> 02:23:55,252
<i>My faith had been shattered
in a way I can never fully describe.</i>

2135
02:23:55,502 --> 02:23:58,255
<i>Every second of my 12 years
with Mr. Muhammad...</i>

2136
02:23:58,464 --> 02:24:00,966
<i>...I'd been ready
to lay down my life for him.</i>

2137
02:24:01,175 --> 02:24:04,803
<i>The thing to me that is worse than
death itself is betrayal.</i>

2138
02:24:05,012 --> 02:24:08,891
<i>I could conceive death,
but I couldn't conceive betrayal.</i>

2139
02:24:09,099 --> 02:24:13,520
<i>Not of the loyalty I gave to
the Nation of Islam and Mr. Muhammad.</i>

2140
02:24:13,771 --> 02:24:17,066
<i>During the previous 12 years, if
Mr. Muhammad had committed any crime...</i>

2141
02:24:17,274 --> 02:24:21,153
<i>...punishable by death,
I would have tried to prove I did it...</i>

2142
02:24:21,362 --> 02:24:22,655
<i>...to save him.</i>

2143
02:24:22,863 --> 02:24:26,241
<i>I would have gladly gone
to the electric chair in his place.</i>

2144
02:24:28,202 --> 02:24:31,080
<i>Up in the mornin'</i>

2145
02:24:32,873 --> 02:24:35,250
<i>Out on the job</i>

2146
02:24:37,628 --> 02:24:40,214
<i>I work like the devil</i>

2147
02:24:40,381 --> 02:24:42,466
<i>For my pay</i>

2148
02:24:42,633 --> 02:24:44,468
What did he say?

2149
02:24:44,635 --> 02:24:50,516
<i>I know that lucky old sun</i>

2150
02:24:51,517 --> 02:24:54,812
- I'm so sorry.
- There's nothing to be sorry about.

2151
02:24:55,479 --> 02:24:58,148
I just got a lot of work to do,
that's all.

2152
02:25:02,277 --> 02:25:03,612
How can you work?

2153
02:25:03,821 --> 02:25:06,073
Because we have to teach.

2154
02:25:06,573 --> 02:25:10,244
We gotta teach the people.
We gotta teach on Solomon, Moses...

2155
02:25:10,577 --> 02:25:13,497
...David.
Solomon had 700 wives.

2156
02:25:13,706 --> 02:25:17,126
A man's good deeds,
they far outweigh any of his....

2157
02:25:18,502 --> 02:25:20,504
My father used to say that, uh...

2158
02:25:21,255 --> 02:25:23,966
...you can't make a rooster stop
crowing after sunrise.

2159
02:25:24,174 --> 02:25:25,843
Well, the sun is up.

2160
02:25:26,593 --> 02:25:31,140
<i>I know that lucky old sun</i>

2161
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:35,978
<i>Has nothin' to do</i>

2162
02:25:38,856 --> 02:25:39,982
<i>But roll around</i>

2163
02:25:40,691 --> 02:25:43,736
<i>Heaven all day</i>

2164
02:25:48,615 --> 02:25:53,579
So, what do I say about this
so-called national day of mourning?

2165
02:25:53,954 --> 02:25:57,458
I say the white man's acts of violence
should be condemned...

2166
02:25:57,666 --> 02:25:59,585
...by our beliefs and by his own.

2167
02:25:59,793 --> 02:26:02,588
The Koran teaches us that
those who work evil...

2168
02:26:03,046 --> 02:26:07,509
...will be condemned, punished
or judged according to their works.

2169
02:26:07,718 --> 02:26:10,929
<i>The Holy Bible teaches us
that you reap what you sow.</i>

2170
02:26:11,138 --> 02:26:12,598
<i>This is divine justice.</i>

2171
02:26:12,806 --> 02:26:16,643
In the Americas' soil, the white man
has planted seeds of hatred...

2172
02:26:16,852 --> 02:26:18,729
<i>...the seeds of violence.</i>

2173
02:26:18,937 --> 02:26:21,523
He's allowed those weeds
to grow up and choke...

2174
02:26:21,732 --> 02:26:25,319
...the lives of millions of black men
and women for 400 years...

2175
02:26:25,527 --> 02:26:28,822
...and the lives of Indians in these
Americas for 500 years.

2176
02:26:29,031 --> 02:26:34,244
And now those same weeds have choked one
of his own gardeners, his chief gardener.

2177
02:26:34,453 --> 02:26:37,706
<i>You ask me what I say.
I only say what the Bible says.</i>

2178
02:26:37,956 --> 02:26:40,209
I say what the Koran says.

2179
02:26:40,959 --> 02:26:42,669
I say it's justice.

2180
02:26:47,549 --> 02:26:50,093
Don't you even feel a bit of remorse...

2181
02:26:50,260 --> 02:26:52,805
...saddened by President Kennedy's
assassination?

2182
02:26:52,971 --> 02:26:56,266
I don't think anyone would deny that
when you send chickens...

2183
02:26:56,475 --> 02:26:58,268
<i>...out from your barnyard...</i>

2184
02:26:58,477 --> 02:27:02,022
<i>...those chickens will return to
your barnyard, not your neighbor's.</i>

2185
02:27:02,231 --> 02:27:05,567
It's an example of the devil's chickens
coming home to roost.

2186
02:27:05,734 --> 02:27:08,779
The violence that he's
perpetrated here and abroad...

2187
02:27:08,987 --> 02:27:12,908
...be it four children in Birmingham,
or Medgar Evers, or in Africa...

2188
02:27:13,116 --> 02:27:15,619
...this same violence has claimed
one of their own.

2189
02:27:15,828 --> 02:27:19,748
Being a farm boy, chickens coming home
to roost never made me sad.

2190
02:27:19,915 --> 02:27:21,542
In fact, it's only made me glad.

2191
02:27:31,218 --> 02:27:32,511
Did you...

2192
02:27:33,512 --> 02:27:36,014
...read the paper today?

2193
02:27:38,767 --> 02:27:40,435
Yes, sir. I did.

2194
02:27:43,730 --> 02:27:48,652
That was a bad statement you made.

2195
02:27:50,779 --> 02:27:54,449
You knew from my instructions...

2196
02:27:54,700 --> 02:27:59,621
...no minister was to make
any statements against this man.

2197
02:27:59,830 --> 02:28:02,374
The country loved this man.

2198
02:28:02,708 --> 02:28:04,543
You have made it...

2199
02:28:04,960 --> 02:28:06,128
...hard...

2200
02:28:06,962 --> 02:28:08,630
...for Muslims...

2201
02:28:09,006 --> 02:28:10,883
...in general.

2202
02:28:13,427 --> 02:28:14,511
Yes, sir.

2203
02:28:14,720 --> 02:28:19,516
We must disassociate ourselves...

2204
02:28:19,725 --> 02:28:22,019
...from your terrible blunder.

2205
02:28:24,563 --> 02:28:26,565
I must silence you.

2206
02:28:27,149 --> 02:28:29,067
For 90 days...

2207
02:28:30,319 --> 02:28:36,325
...you must not make any statements
to the press...

2208
02:28:37,075 --> 02:28:41,413
...nor are you to speak at any temples.

2209
02:28:42,748 --> 02:28:43,916
Yes, sir.

2210
02:28:45,500 --> 02:28:48,420
Yes, sir. I submit 100 percent.

2211
02:29:46,895 --> 02:29:47,980
Leave us alone.

2212
02:29:49,064 --> 02:29:51,274
- Betty?
- Leave us alone. Stop calling here.

2213
02:29:51,483 --> 02:29:54,903
Who's putting you up to this?
We have children here!

2214
02:29:55,237 --> 02:29:56,655
Stop it!

2215
02:29:58,323 --> 02:29:59,741
Hello.

2216
02:30:09,418 --> 02:30:10,752
It's all right.

2217
02:30:11,253 --> 02:30:12,921
They keep calling.

2218
02:30:14,089 --> 02:30:15,924
- They keep calling.
- Shh.

2219
02:30:18,510 --> 02:30:19,803
Just...

2220
02:30:21,513 --> 02:30:23,598
...take the babies and put them to bed.

2221
02:30:24,266 --> 02:30:26,601
Come on, babies.
Let's go to bed now.

2222
02:30:27,102 --> 02:30:28,770
- Bedtime.
- Come on.

2223
02:30:29,438 --> 02:30:30,772
Let's go.

2224
02:30:32,107 --> 02:30:35,694
- Good night, Mommy.
- Good night, Daddy.

2225
02:30:35,861 --> 02:30:38,238
- Good night, Sidney.
- Night-night.

2226
02:30:50,959 --> 02:30:53,628
Brother Minister,
I have to level with you.

2227
02:30:54,463 --> 02:30:56,465
They gave me a mission...

2228
02:30:56,882 --> 02:30:58,300
...but I couldn't do it.

2229
02:30:59,342 --> 02:31:01,928
- I love you all.
- What kind of mission?

2230
02:31:04,723 --> 02:31:06,683
To wire your car...

2231
02:31:06,892 --> 02:31:09,227
...so it would explode...

2232
02:31:09,644 --> 02:31:11,938
...when you turned the ignition.

2233
02:31:13,231 --> 02:31:17,235
The ministers say you're spreading
untruths about Mr. Muhammad.

2234
02:31:17,652 --> 02:31:20,530
They say that
you're the greatest hypocrite...

2235
02:31:20,739 --> 02:31:22,240
...a Judas...

2236
02:31:22,657 --> 02:31:24,576
...a Benedict Arnold.

2237
02:31:25,994 --> 02:31:29,581
The ministers say that
your tongue should be cut out...

2238
02:31:30,082 --> 02:31:33,335
...and delivered
to Mr. Muhammad's doorstep.

2239
02:31:34,044 --> 02:31:35,796
And what do you say?

2240
02:31:36,004 --> 02:31:37,714
I'm with you, Brother Minister.

2241
02:31:37,923 --> 02:31:39,382
You'll be marked for death.

2242
02:31:40,008 --> 02:31:41,176
Yes, sir.

2243
02:31:42,260 --> 02:31:44,221
Let me die then.

2244
02:31:52,104 --> 02:31:53,688
Hmm.

2245
02:31:56,775 --> 02:31:58,985
I can't come between you
and your father.

2246
02:31:59,444 --> 02:32:01,696
- You're my father.
- Go on home.

2247
02:32:03,782 --> 02:32:05,951
Don't come back. That's an order.

2248
02:32:13,542 --> 02:32:15,168
Yes, sir.

2249
02:32:27,639 --> 02:32:31,476
Because 1964 threatens to be an
explosive year on the racial front...

2250
02:32:31,685 --> 02:32:36,314
...I have called this press conference
to clarify my position in that struggle.

2251
02:32:36,606 --> 02:32:40,569
Internal differences within the Nation
of Islam have forced me out of it.

2252
02:32:40,735 --> 02:32:44,781
In the past, I thought and spoke the words
of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

2253
02:32:44,990 --> 02:32:46,908
Everything I said, I started with:

2254
02:32:47,075 --> 02:32:50,412
"The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
teaches us" thus-and-so.

2255
02:32:50,662 --> 02:32:52,289
That day is over.

2256
02:32:52,497 --> 02:32:56,209
From now on I speak my own words,
and I think my own thoughts.

2257
02:32:56,418 --> 02:32:59,129
<i>Now that I have more,
uh, independence of action...</i>

2258
02:32:59,337 --> 02:33:02,757
<i>...I'll use a more flexible approach
in working with others...</i>

2259
02:33:02,924 --> 02:33:04,593
<i>...to solve this problem.</i>

2260
02:33:04,759 --> 02:33:07,095
I'm not out to fight other Negro leaders.

2261
02:33:07,262 --> 02:33:10,765
I've forgotten every bad thing
other leaders said about me...

2262
02:33:10,932 --> 02:33:14,769
...and I pray they'll forget the many
bad things I said about them.

2263
02:33:14,936 --> 02:33:19,024
We must work together to find a common
solution to a common problem.

2264
02:33:19,566 --> 02:33:22,444
<i>I will organize
and lead a new mosque in New York City:</i>

2265
02:33:22,652 --> 02:33:24,362
<i>Muslim Mosque, Incorporated.</i>

2266
02:33:24,779 --> 02:33:28,283
<i>This gives us the religious base
and the spiritual, uh, force...</i>

2267
02:33:28,491 --> 02:33:31,119
<i>...necessary to rid our people
of the vices...</i>

2268
02:33:31,369 --> 02:33:33,705
<i>...that destroy the moral fiber
of our community.</i>

2269
02:33:33,914 --> 02:33:36,291
Our politics
will be Black Nationalism...

2270
02:33:36,458 --> 02:33:39,544
...meaning, we want to control
our community's politics.

2271
02:33:39,753 --> 02:33:42,172
The Muslim Mosque, Inc.
will remain open...

2272
02:33:42,380 --> 02:33:45,634
...for ideas and financial aid
from all quarters.

2273
02:33:46,218 --> 02:33:49,137
Whites can help us,
but they can't join us.

2274
02:33:49,387 --> 02:33:52,849
There can't be black-white unity
until there's first black unity.

2275
02:33:53,141 --> 02:33:54,768
We can't unite with others...

2276
02:33:54,976 --> 02:33:57,854
...until we've first learned
to unite amongst ourselves.

2277
02:33:58,063 --> 02:34:00,190
We can't be acceptable to others...

2278
02:34:00,398 --> 02:34:03,151
...until we have first
proven acceptable to ourselves.

2279
02:34:03,318 --> 02:34:06,821
<i>In my desire to fully understand
the religion of Islam...</i>

2280
02:34:07,030 --> 02:34:11,159
<i>...as practiced by 750 million
Muslims around the world...</i>

2281
02:34:11,326 --> 02:34:15,747
<i>...I intend to make a pilgrimage,
or holy, uh, journey, to Mecca.</i>

2282
02:34:15,956 --> 02:34:18,708
<i>This pilgrimage is
a religious requirement...</i>

2283
02:34:18,917 --> 02:34:21,503
<i>...or duty,
of every Muslim that is able...</i>

2284
02:34:21,670 --> 02:34:25,465
<i>...uh, to make the pilgrimage
at least once in his lifetime.</i>

2285
02:34:39,396 --> 02:34:41,022
I'm Egyptian. And you?

2286
02:34:41,314 --> 02:34:42,399
American.

2287
02:34:42,607 --> 02:34:43,692
What's your name?

2288
02:34:43,858 --> 02:34:46,194
- Malcolm.
- Malcolm.

2289
02:34:56,663 --> 02:34:58,957
Yes, I want to get--

2290
02:35:00,500 --> 02:35:02,627
- How much?
- Twenty Egyptian pounds.

2291
02:35:03,378 --> 02:35:04,629
For one?

2292
02:35:04,838 --> 02:35:07,215
- Special price for you.
- Special for me!

2293
02:35:07,382 --> 02:35:10,802
Okay, thank you.
Where can I get a better price?

2294
02:35:16,266 --> 02:35:18,184
- What's your name?
- Mohammed.

2295
02:35:18,393 --> 02:35:19,936
Mohammed, I'm Malcolm.

2296
02:35:21,062 --> 02:35:23,565
- Malcolm X. And you?
- Gamaal.

2297
02:35:23,815 --> 02:35:27,819
All right, Gamaal. I'm from, uh, Harlem.
From the United States.

2298
02:35:27,986 --> 02:35:29,029
Harem?

2299
02:35:29,195 --> 02:35:30,238
- Harlem.
- Hareem?

2300
02:35:30,405 --> 02:35:32,574
No, not Hareem. Harlem.

2301
02:35:32,741 --> 02:35:34,617
Can you show me around?

2302
02:35:34,826 --> 02:35:36,619
- Hash?
- No. No hashish.

2303
02:35:36,786 --> 02:35:39,164
Uh-- Uh, uh....

2304
02:35:39,331 --> 02:35:41,583
- You know, the pyramids.
- Yeah!

2305
02:35:41,750 --> 02:35:43,501
No, pyramids. Pyramids. Pyramids.

2306
02:35:48,214 --> 02:35:49,924
- Pyramids?
- Pyramids.

2307
02:35:50,091 --> 02:35:52,385
- You're gonna take me?
- Yes. Yes.

2308
02:35:52,761 --> 02:35:54,971
Sphinx. Sphinx.

2309
02:37:16,428 --> 02:37:18,179
<i>My darling Betty:</i>

2310
02:37:18,680 --> 02:37:22,684
<i>Everywhere I go, I am welcomed
as a representative of our people.</i>

2311
02:37:23,017 --> 02:37:26,187
<i>Our struggle is known
and respected worldwide.</i>

2312
02:37:26,688 --> 02:37:30,483
<i>Coincidentally, two white men
follow me around wherever I go.</i>

2313
02:37:30,859 --> 02:37:32,777
<i>I wonder who they're working for?</i>

2314
02:37:33,278 --> 02:37:35,738
<i>If I was a betting man,
I'd say the CIA.</i>

2315
02:37:35,947 --> 02:37:37,115
<i>What's your guess?</i>

2316
02:37:38,116 --> 02:37:40,160
<i>Today I arrived in Arabia.</i>

2317
02:37:40,785 --> 02:37:44,706
<i>I have never witnessed
such sincere hospitality...</i>

2318
02:37:44,873 --> 02:37:47,000
...and true brotherhood...

2319
02:37:47,208 --> 02:37:48,835
<i>...as practiced here...</i>

2320
02:37:49,043 --> 02:37:52,297
<i>...in the ancient home
of Abraham, Mohammed...</i>

2321
02:37:52,839 --> 02:37:56,050
<i>...and the great prophets
of the Scriptures."</i>

2322
02:38:02,307 --> 02:38:04,893
<i>Today, with thousands of others...</i>

2323
02:38:05,059 --> 02:38:08,646
<i>...I proclaimed God's greatness
in the sacred city of Mecca.</i>

2324
02:38:09,731 --> 02:38:13,151
<i>In the</i> ihram <i>garb, I made
my seven circuits around the Kaaba.</i>

2325
02:38:13,735 --> 02:38:16,070
<i>I drank from the well of Zem Zem.</i>

2326
02:38:16,488 --> 02:38:19,240
<i>I prayed to Allah from Mount Arafat.</i>

2327
02:38:19,574 --> 02:38:23,453
<i>It was the only time in my life that
I stood before the creator of all...</i>

2328
02:38:23,661 --> 02:38:26,164
<i>...and felt like a complete human being.</i>

2329
02:38:46,351 --> 02:38:48,937
<i>Now, you may be shocked
by these words...</i>

2330
02:38:49,103 --> 02:38:52,982
<i>...but I've eaten from the same plate,
drunk from the same glass...</i>

2331
02:38:53,191 --> 02:38:57,195
<i>...and prayed to the same God
with Muslims whose eyes were blue...</i>

2332
02:38:57,403 --> 02:39:01,658
<i>...whose hair was blond, and whose
skin was the whitest of white.</i>

2333
02:39:01,866 --> 02:39:03,618
<i>And we were all brothers...</i>

2334
02:39:03,785 --> 02:39:04,827
<i>...truly.</i>

2335
02:39:05,036 --> 02:39:09,624
<i>People of all colors and races
believing in one God, in one humanity.</i>

2336
02:39:24,305 --> 02:39:26,516
<i>Each hour in this sacred land gives me...</i>

2337
02:39:26,724 --> 02:39:30,311
<i>...greater spiritual insight into
what is happening in America.</i>

2338
02:39:30,728 --> 02:39:35,024
<i>The American Negro can never
be blamed for his racial animosities.</i>

2339
02:39:35,233 --> 02:39:39,195
<i>He's only reacting to 400 years of
oppression and discrimination.</i>

2340
02:39:39,404 --> 02:39:42,865
<i>But as racism leads America
up the suicidal path...</i>

2341
02:39:43,074 --> 02:39:46,703
<i>...I believe the younger generation
will see the writing on the wall...</i>

2342
02:39:46,911 --> 02:39:50,331
<i>...and many will want to turn to
the spiritual path of truth...</i>

2343
02:39:50,498 --> 02:39:53,251
<i>...the only way left to ward off
the disaster...</i>

2344
02:39:53,459 --> 02:39:55,420
<i>...that racism must surely lead to.</i>

2345
02:39:56,337 --> 02:40:00,508
<i>Once before, in prison,
the truth came and blinded me.</i>

2346
02:40:01,593 --> 02:40:03,303
<i>Well, it has happened again.</i>

2347
02:40:04,345 --> 02:40:07,849
<i>In the past, I've made sweeping
indictments of all white people.</i>

2348
02:40:08,099 --> 02:40:10,727
<i>And these generalizations
have caused injuries...</i>

2349
02:40:10,935 --> 02:40:13,438
<i>...to some white folks
who didn't deserve them.</i>

2350
02:40:14,522 --> 02:40:18,526
"Because of the spiritual rebirth
which I was blessed to undergo...

2351
02:40:18,735 --> 02:40:20,903
...as a result of my pilgrimage...

2352
02:40:21,112 --> 02:40:23,197
...to the holy city of Mecca...

2353
02:40:24,991 --> 02:40:28,745
...I no longer subscribe
to sweeping indictments of one race.

2354
02:40:29,037 --> 02:40:30,455
<i>I intend...</i>

2355
02:40:31,372 --> 02:40:33,583
<i>...to be very careful not to....</i>

2356
02:40:33,791 --> 02:40:37,587
<i>--careful not to sentence anyone
who has not been proven guilty.</i>

2357
02:40:38,212 --> 02:40:40,256
<i>I am not a racist...</i>

2358
02:40:40,465 --> 02:40:43,760
<i>...and I do not subscribe to any
of the tenets of racism.</i>

2359
02:40:43,968 --> 02:40:45,887
<i>In all honesty and sincerity...</i>

2360
02:40:46,054 --> 02:40:50,183
<i>...it can be stated that I wish
nothing but freedom, justice...</i>

2361
02:40:50,391 --> 02:40:52,060
<i>...and equality...</i>

2362
02:40:52,685 --> 02:40:57,398
<i>...life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness for all people.</i>

2363
02:40:57,815 --> 02:41:01,069
<i>My first concern is with the group
to which I belong...</i>

2364
02:41:01,235 --> 02:41:05,406
<i>...for we, more than others,
are deprived of our inalienable rights.</i>

2365
02:41:05,573 --> 02:41:07,575
<i>But the true practice of Islam...</i>

2366
02:41:07,784 --> 02:41:09,786
<i>...can remove the cancer of racism...</i>

2367
02:41:09,994 --> 02:41:13,623
<i>...from the hearts and the souls
of all Americans.</i>

2368
02:41:13,831 --> 02:41:16,125
<i>If I can die having brought any light...</i>

2369
02:41:16,334 --> 02:41:21,255
<i>...having exposed any truth that
will help destroy this disease...</i>

2370
02:41:22,006 --> 02:41:25,927
<i>...then all the credit is due to Allah,
the Lord of all the worlds.</i>

2371
02:41:26,427 --> 02:41:28,846
<i>And only the mistakes have been mine.</i>

2372
02:41:30,431 --> 02:41:32,767
<i>Please give all my love to the children.</i>

2373
02:41:33,267 --> 02:41:34,852
<i>I love you dearly.</i>

2374
02:41:35,770 --> 02:41:39,023
<i>Sincerely,
El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz...</i>

2375
02:41:39,357 --> 02:41:41,025
<i>...Malcolm X.</i>

2376
02:42:28,823 --> 02:42:29,907
<i>Let's begin.</i>

2377
02:42:30,116 --> 02:42:34,495
<i>Malcolm, you said on your trip abroad
you sensed a feeling of great brotherhood.</i>

2378
02:42:34,662 --> 02:42:38,916
<i>Uh, yes, when I was in Mecca
making the pilgrimage...</i>

2379
02:42:39,834 --> 02:42:44,046
<i>...the brotherhood that existed there
among all people, all races...</i>

2380
02:42:44,255 --> 02:42:48,301
<i>...all levels of people who
had accepted the religion of Islam...</i>

2381
02:42:49,260 --> 02:42:53,848
<i>...what it had done
for those people, despite...</i>

2382
02:42:54,056 --> 02:42:56,017
<i>...their complexion differences....</i>

2383
02:42:56,225 --> 02:42:59,479
<i>Perhaps if people
here in America would try...</i>

2384
02:42:59,687 --> 02:43:03,274
...and practice and study the religion
of Islam, it might help...

2385
02:43:03,483 --> 02:43:07,320
...to erase the plague of racism here.

2386
02:43:07,779 --> 02:43:11,032
I think Muslims over there
look at themselves as...

2387
02:43:11,199 --> 02:43:16,162
...human beings, as part of
the same human family.

2388
02:43:16,621 --> 02:43:19,040
Today my friends are black...

2389
02:43:19,332 --> 02:43:21,709
...red, yellow, brown and white.

2390
02:43:21,918 --> 02:43:26,839
Are you prepared to ask the UN
to bring charges against the U.S...

2391
02:43:27,048 --> 02:43:28,674
...for its treatment of Negroes?

2392
02:43:28,883 --> 02:43:30,843
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

2393
02:43:32,720 --> 02:43:35,223
The audience will have to be quiet.

2394
02:43:36,015 --> 02:43:37,725
<i>Please, please.</i>

2395
02:43:38,643 --> 02:43:41,312
<i>Yes, as I stated earlier that, um...</i>

2396
02:43:42,313 --> 02:43:45,399
<i>...those nations,
African, Latin, Asian nations...</i>

2397
02:43:45,608 --> 02:43:48,611
<i>...are hypocritical
when they stand up in the UN...</i>

2398
02:43:48,820 --> 02:43:52,240
<i>...and denounce the racism practiced
in South Africa...</i>

2399
02:43:52,406 --> 02:43:55,076
...but say absolutely nothing about...

2400
02:43:55,326 --> 02:43:58,454
...the practice of racism here
in American society.

2401
02:43:58,663 --> 02:44:01,332
Now, I wouldn't be a man
if I didn't do so.

2402
02:44:01,541 --> 02:44:06,462
Will you work now with leaders
of other civil rights organizations?

2403
02:44:06,671 --> 02:44:10,758
Yes, we're prepared to work with
any groups, leaders, organizations...

2404
02:44:10,925 --> 02:44:14,428
...as long as they're
genuinely interested in, uh, results.

2405
02:44:14,595 --> 02:44:15,638
Positive results.

2406
02:44:15,847 --> 02:44:18,599
Does your new beard have any
religious significance?

2407
02:44:20,059 --> 02:44:21,936
Uh, no, not particularly, but...

2408
02:44:22,270 --> 02:44:25,773
<i>...I think that, uh, as black people
in America strive...</i>

2409
02:44:25,982 --> 02:44:29,569
<i>...to throw off the shackles
of mental colonialism...</i>

2410
02:44:29,777 --> 02:44:31,779
<i>...they'll also reflect their desire...</i>

2411
02:44:31,988 --> 02:44:34,991
...to throw off the shackles of
cultural colonialism.

2412
02:44:35,199 --> 02:44:38,995
I believe that a mental and cultural
migration back to Africa...

2413
02:44:39,203 --> 02:44:41,247
...not necessarily a physical one...

2414
02:44:41,455 --> 02:44:45,042
...but a mental and cultural
migration back to Africa...

2415
02:44:45,251 --> 02:44:49,380
...which means we reaffirm our bond
with our brothers over there...

2416
02:44:49,672 --> 02:44:53,843
...would help to strengthen,
uh, us here, black people in America.

2417
02:44:54,051 --> 02:44:57,346
Not only spiritually,
but it would give us the incentive...

2418
02:44:57,555 --> 02:45:00,766
...to solve some of our problems here,
at, uh, at home.

2419
02:45:00,975 --> 02:45:03,561
One of your
more controversial remarks...

2420
02:45:03,769 --> 02:45:06,898
...called for black people to get
rifles and form clubs.

2421
02:45:07,106 --> 02:45:08,816
Do you still favor that for self-defense?

2422
02:45:08,983 --> 02:45:10,985
<i>I don't see why that's controversial.</i>

2423
02:45:11,193 --> 02:45:14,113
<i>If white people find themselves
the victims...</i>

2424
02:45:14,322 --> 02:45:18,826
<i>...of the violence black people found
themselves victims of in America...</i>

2425
02:45:19,035 --> 02:45:22,788
<i>...and if the government was unable
or unwilling to do anything...</i>

2426
02:45:22,997 --> 02:45:26,125
<i>...it'd be intelligence on their part
to defend themselves.</i>

2427
02:45:26,334 --> 02:45:27,835
<i>What about the guns?</i>

2428
02:45:29,712 --> 02:45:33,507
When you tell your people to stop
being violent against my people...

2429
02:45:33,716 --> 02:45:37,511
- ...I'll tell my people to put away their guns.
- So you're still an extremist.

2430
02:45:37,845 --> 02:45:39,764
Get your hand out of my pocket!

2431
02:45:43,726 --> 02:45:45,186
Damn.

2432
02:45:46,395 --> 02:45:47,438
Next question.

2433
02:46:07,792 --> 02:46:11,504
<i>Malcolm, you one dead, red nigger.</i>

2434
02:46:12,046 --> 02:46:16,008
<i>Your days on this earth
are numbered, brother.</i>

2435
02:46:28,396 --> 02:46:29,522
Come to bed.

2436
02:46:30,106 --> 02:46:31,899
Get some rest.

2437
02:46:37,405 --> 02:46:38,906
I'm sorry, Betty.

2438
02:46:40,449 --> 02:46:41,534
Sorry for what?

2439
02:46:41,742 --> 02:46:45,413
I haven't been the best husband
or the best father.

2440
02:46:45,579 --> 02:46:48,207
A family shouldn't be separated
like ours has been.

2441
02:46:48,416 --> 02:46:52,086
I promise I'll never make a long trip
without you and the children.

2442
02:46:55,756 --> 02:46:57,299
I miss you and the girls.

2443
02:47:03,431 --> 02:47:05,433
We will be together,
I promise you that.

2444
02:47:06,767 --> 02:47:07,810
Dear heart....

2445
02:47:10,146 --> 02:47:11,647
I love you.

2446
02:47:16,360 --> 02:47:17,945
Thank you.

2447
02:47:25,453 --> 02:47:27,288
Now get some sleep.

2448
02:47:32,168 --> 02:47:35,463
We had the best organization
the black man has ever seen.

2449
02:47:36,839 --> 02:47:38,132
Niggers ruined it.

2450
02:48:05,409 --> 02:48:06,660
Betty.

2451
02:48:09,371 --> 02:48:10,664
Betty, wake up.

2452
02:48:14,835 --> 02:48:16,212
Come on! Let's get up!

2453
02:48:16,420 --> 02:48:18,798
Girls, come on! Come on!
Out! Out!

2454
02:48:19,173 --> 02:48:20,674
Outside! Out! Out! Out!

2455
02:48:22,843 --> 02:48:25,179
Go, go! Run, run!

2456
02:48:25,387 --> 02:48:27,640
Go across the street!

2457
02:48:27,848 --> 02:48:30,768
- Somebody call the fire department!
- Help! Help!

2458
02:48:32,144 --> 02:48:34,188
Call the fire department, please!

2459
02:48:34,355 --> 02:48:36,398
Somebody call the fire department!

2460
02:48:36,607 --> 02:48:37,858
I'm a man!

2461
02:48:38,067 --> 02:48:40,027
Evidently, the, um...

2462
02:48:40,736 --> 02:48:44,406
...some type of Molotov bomb was thrown
against the back of the house.

2463
02:48:44,573 --> 02:48:48,077
One was thrown on the side
of the house, from what I can tell.

2464
02:48:51,038 --> 02:48:53,999
It bounced up against the window
and woke my daughter.

2465
02:48:54,208 --> 02:48:57,169
Had it gone inside,
my 2-year-old, my 4-year-old...

2466
02:48:57,378 --> 02:48:59,588
...and my 6-year-old daughter
would have--

2467
02:48:59,755 --> 02:49:02,174
Had that happened,
I'd have taken my rifle...

2468
02:49:02,383 --> 02:49:04,009
...and gone after anyone in sight.

2469
02:49:04,218 --> 02:49:07,012
Was this a warning
or an attempt on your life?

2470
02:49:07,221 --> 02:49:09,598
What, does it look like
a warning to you?

2471
02:49:09,807 --> 02:49:11,559
This was a definite attempt...

2472
02:49:11,892 --> 02:49:15,521
...by the Nation of Islam, upon
the strict orders of Mr. Elijah Muhammad.

2473
02:49:15,729 --> 02:49:18,816
- Muslim headquarters say--
- I don't care what they say.

2474
02:49:19,024 --> 02:49:20,401
I see what they're doing.

2475
02:49:20,568 --> 02:49:24,238
Minister Baines, can you tell us
who bombed the house?

2476
02:49:24,530 --> 02:49:28,409
We feel it's a publicity stunt
on the part of Malcolm X.

2477
02:49:28,617 --> 02:49:31,245
We hope it isn't a case of, well...

2478
02:49:31,412 --> 02:49:33,539
...if he can't keep the house,
we won't get it either.

2479
02:49:33,747 --> 02:49:35,249
That's enough. Excuse me.

2480
02:49:39,461 --> 02:49:41,088
Malcolm!

2481
02:49:41,755 --> 02:49:43,090
I'm all right. I'm all right.

2482
02:49:43,257 --> 02:49:45,050
- Betty and the kids?
- They're fine.

2483
02:49:45,259 --> 02:49:47,428
Let's post some
men in front of the house.

2484
02:49:47,636 --> 02:49:50,556
- Did you see anybody?
- No, but I know who it is.

2485
02:49:50,764 --> 02:49:53,100
- You know I know who did it.
- Give us the command.

2486
02:49:53,309 --> 02:49:56,103
Don't worry about the command.
Two men on post, two in front!

2487
02:49:56,270 --> 02:49:58,480
We got an informant among us,
whether you like it or not.

2488
02:49:58,647 --> 02:50:01,775
Now, we gotta weed this so-called
brother out before things get too crazy.

2489
02:50:31,472 --> 02:50:32,598
Spark it.

2490
02:50:42,691 --> 02:50:44,693
<i>As-Salaam-Alaikum,</i> my brothers.

2491
02:50:46,654 --> 02:50:50,199
- Here's your key. Enjoy your stay.
- Thank you.

2492
02:50:53,994 --> 02:50:55,663
O.A.A.U.

2493
02:50:56,997 --> 02:50:59,083
Brother Earl, it's Malcolm.

2494
02:51:01,627 --> 02:51:04,338
- Earl.
- Malcolm. Where are you?

2495
02:51:04,505 --> 02:51:05,965
We've been calling
all over the city.

2496
02:51:06,215 --> 02:51:07,549
Hold on.

2497
02:51:16,100 --> 02:51:18,018
<i>I'm downtown.</i>

2498
02:51:18,352 --> 02:51:21,647
<i>I'm in a hotel trying
to get some work done for tomorrow.</i>

2499
02:51:21,855 --> 02:51:24,692
- Let me bring some brothers there.
<i>- That's all right.</i>

2500
02:51:24,984 --> 02:51:27,069
<i>I wish you'd listen to us.</i>

2501
02:51:27,278 --> 02:51:30,489
We must frisk people
at the Audubon Ballroom meeting.

2502
02:51:30,698 --> 02:51:33,200
No, no. I don't want....

2503
02:51:33,534 --> 02:51:35,536
I don't want anybody frisked.

2504
02:51:37,705 --> 02:51:39,707
We have to change our way of thinking.

2505
02:51:39,915 --> 02:51:42,042
We have to make people
feel comfortable.

2506
02:51:42,251 --> 02:51:45,838
<i>If I can't be safe around my own kind,
who can I be safe around?</i>

2507
02:51:46,046 --> 02:51:47,881
<i>I trust Allah will protect me.</i>

2508
02:51:48,048 --> 02:51:52,303
Believing in Allah is one thing,
but I also believe in being armed.

2509
02:51:55,556 --> 02:51:59,226
We don't want black people
killing each other, all right?

2510
02:52:01,645 --> 02:52:02,688
All right?

2511
02:52:02,896 --> 02:52:04,606
We'll protect you, Malcolm.

2512
02:52:05,399 --> 02:52:06,608
<i>As-Salaam-Alaikum.</i>

2513
02:52:06,817 --> 02:52:10,404
<i>No, peace be unto you, Earl.
Peace be unto you.</i>

2514
02:52:30,924 --> 02:52:34,011
<i>I said, shotgun</i>

2515
02:52:35,429 --> 02:52:38,015
<i>Shoot him 'fore he runs, now</i>

2516
02:52:39,391 --> 02:52:42,061
<i>Do the jerk, baby</i>

2517
02:52:43,437 --> 02:52:45,856
<i>Do the jerk, now</i>

2518
02:52:47,149 --> 02:52:49,485
Good evening.
Do you have a Malcolm X registered?

2519
02:52:54,740 --> 02:52:58,369
<i>I said, buy yourself a shotgun, now</i>

2520
02:53:02,748 --> 02:53:06,210
<i>We're gonna load it up, baby, now</i>

2521
02:53:06,752 --> 02:53:09,880
<i>A-then you shoot him 'fore he run, now</i>

2522
02:53:10,589 --> 02:53:13,467
<i>I said, shotgun</i>

2523
02:53:15,219 --> 02:53:17,805
<i>Shoot him 'fore he run, now</i>

2524
02:53:23,394 --> 02:53:26,855
<i>Do the jerk, now</i>

2525
02:53:47,084 --> 02:53:50,504
<i>Your red nigger
is dead and so are your bastard children!</i>

2526
02:53:53,173 --> 02:53:55,467
<i>Shotgun</i>

2527
02:53:57,094 --> 02:53:58,345
<i>Shoot him 'fore he run, now</i>

2528
02:54:01,223 --> 02:54:04,309
<i>Do the jerk, baby</i>

2529
02:54:05,185 --> 02:54:08,105
<i>Do the jerk, now</i>

2530
02:54:09,356 --> 02:54:12,192
<i>Put on your high-heel shoes</i>

2531
02:54:12,359 --> 02:54:15,320
<i>I said, we're going down here
Listen to them play them blues</i>

2532
02:54:15,487 --> 02:54:17,364
- Hello.
<i>- Wake up, brother.</i>

2533
02:54:17,906 --> 02:54:19,783
As-Salaam-Alaikum.

2534
02:54:28,041 --> 02:54:31,462
You hear me and hear me well.
You come anywhere near my family...

2535
02:54:31,628 --> 02:54:33,714
- ...and I will kill you.
<i>- Betty?</i>

2536
02:54:33,881 --> 02:54:35,048
Do you hear?

2537
02:54:35,215 --> 02:54:36,216
<i>Betty, shh.</i>

2538
02:54:36,383 --> 02:54:39,887
- Betty, it's me. It's Malcolm.
- Malcolm.

2539
02:54:42,431 --> 02:54:44,475
Oh, ha, ha.

2540
02:54:44,641 --> 02:54:46,351
They keep calling.

2541
02:54:46,560 --> 02:54:49,855
They keep threatening.
I go crazy every time a phone rings.

2542
02:54:50,063 --> 02:54:53,233
Just don't answer the phone.
Everything will be all right.

2543
02:54:53,442 --> 02:54:55,944
<i>- When will it stop?</i>
- Don't answer the phone.

2544
02:54:57,112 --> 02:55:01,533
<i>- Are the brothers there on post?</i>
- Yes, they're outside.

2545
02:55:01,742 --> 02:55:04,536
<i>Let them answer the phone.
Don't touch the phone.</i>

2546
02:55:04,745 --> 02:55:05,913
Beloved, where are you?

2547
02:55:06,121 --> 02:55:07,831
I'm in a hotel.

2548
02:55:09,082 --> 02:55:10,083
In a hotel.

2549
02:55:10,459 --> 02:55:13,128
<i>- The girls asleep?</i>
- Yes.

2550
02:55:13,295 --> 02:55:16,423
I just put them down to bed.

2551
02:55:17,299 --> 02:55:19,468
<i>Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?</i>

2552
02:55:21,762 --> 02:55:23,430
No, I don't think so.

2553
02:55:24,431 --> 02:55:27,267
<i>The girls and I want to see you.
We miss you.</i>

2554
02:55:28,143 --> 02:55:30,145
Betty, it's too dangerous.

2555
02:55:30,938 --> 02:55:33,065
<i>It's been dangerous.</i>

2556
02:55:36,235 --> 02:55:39,279
Listen, I haven't told this to anybody...

2557
02:55:41,990 --> 02:55:43,784
...but I've been thinking...

2558
02:55:43,992 --> 02:55:47,329
...about what's been happening
to me lately, to us lately...

2559
02:55:48,163 --> 02:55:51,583
...and I'm gonna stop saying
The Nation of Islam's behind this.

2560
02:55:51,792 --> 02:55:55,170
I know what they can and can't do.
I trained them.

2561
02:55:57,005 --> 02:56:00,133
Some of the things that have
been happening lately....

2562
02:56:02,177 --> 02:56:05,430
I'm gonna stop saying it's just
The Nation of Islam.

2563
02:56:05,639 --> 02:56:07,683
They're not working alone.

2564
02:56:08,308 --> 02:56:10,143
They're getting a lot of help.

2565
02:56:10,352 --> 02:56:12,145
<i>Are you sure?</i>

2566
02:56:13,021 --> 02:56:14,481
<i>I miss you, Betty.</i>

2567
02:56:18,110 --> 02:56:20,487
<i>You're with us even when you're away.</i>

2568
02:56:20,696 --> 02:56:24,032
<i>Now, listen, you come on down
to the Audubon tomorrow.</i>

2569
02:56:24,992 --> 02:56:28,787
<i>We'll be all right. We're not gonna let this
get us down. We'll be fine.</i>

2570
02:56:28,996 --> 02:56:31,123
<i>You come on down. Bring the girls too.</i>

2571
02:56:31,331 --> 02:56:33,917
<i>The girls and I miss you so much.</i>

2572
02:56:34,084 --> 02:56:35,294
<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

2573
02:56:35,502 --> 02:56:37,588
Compared to King, this guy's a monk.

2574
02:56:37,796 --> 02:56:40,841
<i>- Good night. Sleep well. I love you.</i>
<i>- Good night.</i>

2575
02:56:53,854 --> 02:56:56,523
Sweetheart, Attallah, sit back.

2576
02:56:56,732 --> 02:56:59,943
Sit up. Sit up straight.

2577
02:57:26,094 --> 02:57:27,888
Mama, I want the doll.

2578
02:58:01,588 --> 02:58:02,923
Go sit down.

2579
02:58:14,393 --> 02:58:15,435
Sister?

2580
02:58:19,147 --> 02:58:22,109
- What do you say to the nice man?
- Thank you.

2581
02:58:22,275 --> 02:58:24,444
You're very welcome,
my beautiful sister.

2582
02:58:25,570 --> 02:58:26,613
Bye-bye.

2583
02:58:43,004 --> 02:58:45,298
The minister hasn't arrived yet.

2584
02:58:45,632 --> 02:58:48,135
Don't worry.
He'll be here like clockwork.

2585
02:59:21,251 --> 02:59:22,335
Son?

2586
02:59:22,544 --> 02:59:23,670
Son?

2587
02:59:24,838 --> 02:59:26,298
Are you all right?

2588
02:59:26,506 --> 02:59:27,549
Are you okay?

2589
02:59:30,302 --> 02:59:33,305
- Yeah.
- Good. I recognize you.

2590
02:59:33,513 --> 02:59:36,016
Don't you pay them folks
no never mind.

2591
02:59:36,224 --> 02:59:38,852
You just keep right on doing
what you doing.

2592
02:59:40,937 --> 02:59:42,105
Yes, ma'am.

2593
02:59:42,272 --> 02:59:45,025
- Ha, ha. I'll pray for you, son.
- Well, thank you.

2594
02:59:45,400 --> 02:59:47,277
Jesus will protect you.

2595
03:00:01,708 --> 03:00:03,210
Is the charter ready?

2596
03:00:03,376 --> 03:00:05,504
- Uh, no, Brother Minister.
- No?

2597
03:00:07,088 --> 03:00:08,548
No? Why not?

2598
03:00:10,926 --> 03:00:12,844
You had enough time, didn't you?

2599
03:00:13,053 --> 03:00:15,347
I apologize.
We'll have it next week.

2600
03:00:15,555 --> 03:00:17,849
We don't have next week.
We need it today.

2601
03:00:18,058 --> 03:00:20,393
The people want to hear
the charter today.

2602
03:00:20,602 --> 03:00:22,270
Next week, Minister.

2603
03:00:28,735 --> 03:00:30,111
Is the reverend here?

2604
03:00:30,445 --> 03:00:33,740
The reverend called and said
he wouldn't be able to attend.

2605
03:00:35,242 --> 03:00:38,745
So now we don't have
an opening speaker or a charter....

2606
03:00:39,538 --> 03:00:42,374
Why didn't you say this last night
when I talked to you?

2607
03:00:42,582 --> 03:00:45,418
- I called Sister Betty--
- You didn't have to call her.

2608
03:00:45,627 --> 03:00:47,587
You should've told me. Why tell her?

2609
03:00:47,796 --> 03:00:50,090
- I assumed that--
- Don't assume anything!

2610
03:01:00,600 --> 03:01:01,768
Go on down front.

2611
03:01:02,102 --> 03:01:04,646
- Sister, you go on with the brother.
- Yes, sir.

2612
03:01:19,411 --> 03:01:20,662
Malcolm....

2613
03:01:23,290 --> 03:01:24,499
What's wrong?

2614
03:01:29,004 --> 03:01:31,339
It's a time for martyrs now.

2615
03:01:35,051 --> 03:01:36,928
The way I feel...

2616
03:01:38,346 --> 03:01:40,432
...I shouldn't go out there today.

2617
03:01:42,017 --> 03:01:44,519
Fine. Let's cancel it.

2618
03:01:47,522 --> 03:01:49,691
My wife out there? My children?

2619
03:01:50,108 --> 03:01:52,110
Down front, as always.

2620
03:01:55,113 --> 03:01:57,782
Go out to the pay phone outside.

2621
03:01:59,284 --> 03:02:03,580
Call up the reverend,
see if he can make it down here.

2622
03:02:03,788 --> 03:02:07,959
I gotta be on post, Malcolm.
I'm supposed to be out there guarding you.

2623
03:02:08,168 --> 03:02:13,089
- Besides, that's a duty for secretaries--
- Go out to the pay phone.

2624
03:02:13,632 --> 03:02:15,216
Call up the reverend.

2625
03:02:15,717 --> 03:02:17,552
See if he can make it down here.

2626
03:02:22,015 --> 03:02:23,224
Fine.

2627
03:03:12,190 --> 03:03:15,443
<i>Please, let's settle down.
Let's get the program started.</i>

2628
03:03:18,571 --> 03:03:19,864
Thank you.

2629
03:03:24,661 --> 03:03:27,497
I apologize for raising my voice earlier.

2630
03:03:27,706 --> 03:03:29,290
It was very disrespectful.

2631
03:03:29,541 --> 03:03:32,043
Brother Minister, I understand.

2632
03:03:41,052 --> 03:03:42,345
Why, styles are changing...

2633
03:03:42,512 --> 03:03:45,432
...minds are changing,
why, everything is changing.

2634
03:03:46,099 --> 03:03:50,145
So you and I must consider that
we're living in very changing times.

2635
03:03:50,562 --> 03:03:54,024
And what might be true today
may not be true tomorrow.

2636
03:03:54,941 --> 03:03:57,610
And without any further ado,
I present to you...

2637
03:03:58,069 --> 03:04:00,780
...Brother Minister Malcolm.
And I pray...

2638
03:04:01,239 --> 03:04:04,951
...that you and I will listen. Listen...

2639
03:04:05,577 --> 03:04:09,122
...hear and understand. Thank you.

2640
03:04:16,129 --> 03:04:17,464
Daddy!

2641
03:04:31,811 --> 03:04:33,980
Get your hand out of my pocket!

2642
03:04:35,690 --> 03:04:36,816
Brother....

2643
03:04:36,983 --> 03:04:38,109
Please. Hold it.

2644
03:04:39,778 --> 03:04:41,821
Calm down. Please, brothers!

2645
03:04:41,988 --> 03:04:43,031
Brothers....

2646
03:04:43,490 --> 03:04:44,783
Malcolm!

2647
03:04:46,409 --> 03:04:47,660
Malcolm!

2648
03:05:20,527 --> 03:05:21,861
Malcolm!

2649
03:05:24,656 --> 03:05:26,741
Get an ambulance!

2650
03:05:26,950 --> 03:05:29,369
- Somebody get an ambulance!
- They killed him!

2651
03:05:31,162 --> 03:05:33,164
They killed him!

2652
03:05:41,881 --> 03:05:45,135
I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you!

2653
03:05:48,054 --> 03:05:49,597
Get him!

2654
03:05:51,015 --> 03:05:53,226
He killed Malcolm!

2655
03:06:03,903 --> 03:06:05,864
Back off, people!

2656
03:06:40,148 --> 03:06:42,775
We've got multiple shooting victims.

2657
03:06:52,160 --> 03:06:53,453
Get out of the way!

2658
03:06:58,708 --> 03:06:59,751
Move!

2659
03:07:08,092 --> 03:07:11,054
Stand back! Get out of the way!
Get back!

2660
03:07:12,931 --> 03:07:15,391
Give us a statement, sir! Please!

2661
03:07:15,600 --> 03:07:19,020
The person you know
as Malcolm X is no more.

2662
03:07:19,354 --> 03:07:21,356
<i>The assassination...</i>

2663
03:07:21,606 --> 03:07:25,193
<i>...of Malcolm X
was an unfortunate tragedy.</i>

2664
03:07:25,610 --> 03:07:28,279
<i>And it reveals that there are still...</i>

2665
03:07:28,613 --> 03:07:31,699
<i>...uh, numerous people
in our nation who have...</i>

2666
03:07:31,950 --> 03:07:36,621
<i>...degenerated to the point of
expressing dissent through murder...</i>

2667
03:07:36,871 --> 03:07:41,417
<i>...and we haven't learned to disagree
without being violently disagreeable.</i>

2668
03:07:42,710 --> 03:07:43,795
<i>Here...</i>

2669
03:07:44,545 --> 03:07:47,215
<i>...at this final hour...</i>

2670
03:07:47,799 --> 03:07:50,051
<i>...in this quiet place...</i>

2671
03:07:50,760 --> 03:07:53,054
<i>...Harlem has come to bid farewell...</i>

2672
03:07:53,263 --> 03:07:55,682
<i>...to one of its brightest hopes...</i>

2673
03:07:56,683 --> 03:07:58,685
<i>...extinguished now...</i>

2674
03:07:59,143 --> 03:08:01,813
<i>...and gone from us forever.</i>

2675
03:08:02,689 --> 03:08:05,733
<i>It is not in the memory
of man that this...</i>

2676
03:08:05,942 --> 03:08:07,527
<i>...beleaguered, unfortunate...</i>

2677
03:08:07,694 --> 03:08:09,862
<i>...but nonetheless proud community...</i>

2678
03:08:10,238 --> 03:08:14,659
<i>...has found a braver,
more gallant young champion...</i>

2679
03:08:14,909 --> 03:08:18,371
<i>...than this Afro-American
who lies before us...</i>

2680
03:08:19,330 --> 03:08:21,332
<i>...unconquered still.</i>

2681
03:08:23,209 --> 03:08:25,586
<i>I say the word again as
he would want me to:</i>

2682
03:08:25,795 --> 03:08:27,171
<i>Afro-American.</i>

2683
03:08:27,380 --> 03:08:30,717
<i>Afro-American Malcolm.</i>

2684
03:08:30,883 --> 03:08:33,636
<i>Malcolm had stopped being "Negro"...</i>

2685
03:08:33,845 --> 03:08:35,179
<i>...years ago.</i>

2686
03:08:35,388 --> 03:08:40,351
<i>It had become too small, too puny,
too weak a word for him.</i>

2687
03:08:40,685 --> 03:08:42,895
<i>Malcolm was bigger than that.</i>

2688
03:08:43,187 --> 03:08:44,480
<i>Malcolm had become...</i>

2689
03:08:44,731 --> 03:08:46,941
<i>...an Afro-American.</i>

2690
03:08:47,233 --> 03:08:49,444
<i>And he wanted so desperately...</i>

2691
03:08:49,986 --> 03:08:52,572
<i>...that we, that all his people...</i>

2692
03:08:52,780 --> 03:08:55,908
<i>...would become Afro-Americans too.</i>

2693
03:08:59,912 --> 03:09:03,374
<i>There are those who
still consider it their duty...</i>

2694
03:09:03,583 --> 03:09:07,253
<i>...as friends of the Negro people,
to tell us...</i>

2695
03:09:07,795 --> 03:09:09,547
<i>...to revile him.</i>

2696
03:09:09,756 --> 03:09:13,051
<i>To flee, even from
the presence of his memory.</i>

2697
03:09:13,259 --> 03:09:14,761
<i>To save ourselves...</i>

2698
03:09:14,969 --> 03:09:19,557
<i>...by writing him out of
the history of our turbulent times.</i>

2699
03:09:19,932 --> 03:09:21,976
<i>And we will smile.</i>

2700
03:09:22,268 --> 03:09:24,604
<i>They will say that
he is of hate, a fanatic...</i>

2701
03:09:24,812 --> 03:09:27,815
<i>...a racist, who can only bring
evil to the cause...</i>

2702
03:09:28,024 --> 03:09:29,442
<i>...for which you struggle.</i>

2703
03:09:29,650 --> 03:09:32,612
<i>And we will answer and
say unto them:</i>

2704
03:09:32,820 --> 03:09:34,781
<i>"Did you ever talk...</i>

2705
03:09:35,156 --> 03:09:36,824
<i>...to Brother Malcolm?</i>

2706
03:09:37,450 --> 03:09:39,285
<i>Did you ever touch him...</i>

2707
03:09:39,494 --> 03:09:41,621
<i>...or have him smile at you?</i>

2708
03:09:41,829 --> 03:09:44,248
<i>Did you ever really listen to him?"</i>

2709
03:09:44,415 --> 03:09:46,292
<i>You haven't done the right thing.</i>

2710
03:09:46,459 --> 03:09:50,630
<i>"Was he ever associated
with violence or any public disturbance?</i>

2711
03:09:50,838 --> 03:09:53,758
<i>For if you did, you would know him.</i>

2712
03:09:53,966 --> 03:09:55,468
<i>And if you knew him...</i>

2713
03:09:55,676 --> 03:09:59,430
<i>...you would know why
we must honor him."</i>

2714
03:09:59,639 --> 03:10:03,976
<i>Malcolm was our manhood.
Our living, black manhood.</i>

2715
03:10:04,185 --> 03:10:06,270
<i>This was his meaning
to his people.</i>

2716
03:10:06,521 --> 03:10:11,150
<i>And in honoring him,
we honor the best in ourselves.</i>

2717
03:10:12,485 --> 03:10:15,154
<i>However much we may have
differed with him...</i>

2718
03:10:15,363 --> 03:10:18,449
<i>...or with each other about him
and his value as a man...</i>

2719
03:10:18,658 --> 03:10:20,785
<i>...let his going from us serve...</i>

2720
03:10:20,993 --> 03:10:24,038
<i>...only to bring us together now...</i>

2721
03:10:25,039 --> 03:10:27,708
<i>...consigning these mortal
remains to earth...</i>

2722
03:10:28,209 --> 03:10:30,294
<i>...the common mother of all...</i>

2723
03:10:30,503 --> 03:10:33,840
<i>...secure in the knowledge
that what we place in the ground...</i>

2724
03:10:34,006 --> 03:10:35,341
<i>...is no more now a man...</i>

2725
03:10:35,633 --> 03:10:37,176
<i>...but a seed...</i>

2726
03:10:37,510 --> 03:10:40,471
<i>...which after the winter of
our discontent...</i>

2727
03:10:40,680 --> 03:10:43,516
<i>...will come forth again to meet us.</i>

2728
03:10:43,724 --> 03:10:45,977
<i>And we shall know him then...</i>

2729
03:10:46,185 --> 03:10:49,021
<i>...for what he was and is:</i>

2730
03:10:49,230 --> 03:10:51,023
<i>A prince.</i>

2731
03:10:51,232 --> 03:10:54,861
<i>Our own black shining prince...</i>

2732
03:10:55,570 --> 03:10:58,739
<i>...who didn't hesitate to die...</i>

2733
03:10:59,073 --> 03:11:00,408
<i>...because...</i>

2734
03:11:01,075 --> 03:11:02,326
<i>...he loved us so.</i>

2735
03:11:03,453 --> 03:11:08,040
And so today, May 19th,
we celebrate Malcolm X's birthday...

2736
03:11:08,249 --> 03:11:12,086
...because he was
a great, great Afro-American.

2737
03:11:12,378 --> 03:11:15,047
Malcolm X is you, all of you.

2738
03:11:15,423 --> 03:11:17,508
And you are Malcolm X.

2739
03:11:18,050 --> 03:11:19,177
I'm Malcolm X!

2740
03:11:19,343 --> 03:11:20,511
I'm Malcolm X!

2741
03:11:20,678 --> 03:11:22,638
- I'm Malcolm X!
- I'm Malcolm X!

2742
03:11:22,805 --> 03:11:25,057
- I'm Malcolm X!
- I am Malcolm X!

2743
03:11:25,224 --> 03:11:27,560
- I am Malcolm X!
- I am Malcolm X!

2744
03:11:27,727 --> 03:11:30,855
- I am Malcolm X!
- I am Malcolm X!

2745
03:11:31,022 --> 03:11:33,441
As Brother Malcolm said:

2746
03:11:36,277 --> 03:11:38,237
"We declare...

2747
03:11:39,572 --> 03:11:41,240
...our right...

2748
03:11:43,367 --> 03:11:45,077
...on this earth...

2749
03:11:46,412 --> 03:11:48,039
...to be a man...

2750
03:11:50,249 --> 03:11:52,418
...to be a human being...

2751
03:11:54,712 --> 03:11:57,089
...to be given the rights...

2752
03:11:57,882 --> 03:11:59,592
...of a human being...

2753
03:12:01,427 --> 03:12:03,262
...to be respected...

2754
03:12:04,430 --> 03:12:06,724
...as a human being...

2755
03:12:07,600 --> 03:12:09,894
...in this society...

2756
03:12:11,103 --> 03:12:12,939
...on this earth...

2757
03:12:14,440 --> 03:12:16,275
...in this day...

2758
03:12:16,901 --> 03:12:19,529
...which we intend to bring...

2759
03:12:19,737 --> 03:12:21,072
...into existence--"

2760
03:12:21,280 --> 03:12:24,116
--by any means necessary!
