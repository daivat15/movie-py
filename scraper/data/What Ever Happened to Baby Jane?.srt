1
00:00:07,157 --> 00:00:10,217
<i>Want to see it again, little girl?</i>
<i>It shouldn't frighten you.</i>

2
00:00:28,812 --> 00:00:31,406
Sorry. Nothing until matinee tomorrow.

3
00:00:43,326 --> 00:00:46,454
- Lady, would you mind taking off your hat?
- Excuse me.

4
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:00,841
Attagirl, Janey. Show them how.

5
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:30,865
Thank you, folks. Thank you very much.

6
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,144
One final request, all right?

7
00:01:42,418 --> 00:01:44,352
<i>I've Written a Letter to Daddy.</i>

8
00:01:44,788 --> 00:01:47,586
All right, thank you.

9
00:01:47,757 --> 00:01:49,987
<i>I've Written a Letter to Daddy.</i>

10
00:02:07,477 --> 00:02:13,006
<i>I've written a letter to Daddy</i>

11
00:02:14,317 --> 00:02:19,186
<i>His address is heaven above</i>

12
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:25,390
<i>I've written, "Dear Daddy, we miss you</i>

13
00:02:26,996 --> 00:02:32,559
<i>"And wish you were with us to love!"</i>

14
00:02:33,436 --> 00:02:38,237
<i>Instead of a stamp I put kisses</i>

15
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:44,507
<i>The postman says that's best to do</i>

16
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:51,343
<i>I've written this letter to Daddy</i>

17
00:02:51,654 --> 00:02:57,183
<i>Saying, "I love you"</i>

18
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:25,113
<i>I've written a letter to Daddy</i>

19
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:31,385
<i>Saying, "I love you"</i>

20
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,569
Thank you very much.

21
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:52,339
Well, what do we have here?

22
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,077
All for you.

23
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,584
Jane, isn't that a beautiful doll?

24
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,712
Thank you, young man,
that's a gorgeous doll.

25
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:01,916
Folks, have you ever seen
such a lovely doll?

26
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,625
All right, children, thank you.

27
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:16,496
Now, folks, please don't forget,
there's a genuine Baby Jane doll...

28
00:04:16,572 --> 00:04:19,097
waiting for each one of you
right out in the foyer.

29
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:22,440
All you have to do is go out there
and collect her. Kids, remember...

30
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,208
you can tell your moms
that each and every one of...

31
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:27,442
these genuine, beautiful, great big dolls...

32
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:31,283
is an exact replica
of your own Baby Jane Hudson.

33
00:04:31,754 --> 00:04:33,051
Thank you.

34
00:04:35,391 --> 00:04:37,450
Baby Jane dolls. Only $3.25.

35
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,496
There they are.
Very beautiful, natural hair.

36
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,477
I won't! I don't wanna go back
to that old hotel!

37
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,139
I don't have to take a nap
and you can't make me!

38
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,581
Don't act up, sweetheart. You've got
to take your nap. You know that.

39
00:05:01,651 --> 00:05:04,279
No, I don't know, and I'm not going to!

40
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,349
You don't want all these nice friends
of yours out here...

41
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:09,414
to think you're a bad little girl, do you?

42
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:12,484
I don't care. I want an ice cream.

43
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,655
- Janey, I told you...
- I want it!

44
00:05:14,964 --> 00:05:17,626
I make the money,
so I can have what I want!

45
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,361
Janey, that's enough.

46
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,764
Leave me alone. I need an ice cream!

47
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:26,431
Well, if you need an ice cream,
I guess you better have some.

48
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:28,840
I mean, it's pretty hot and all.

49
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:31,675
But, remember,
this is the last time this week.

50
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:35,682
All right, Daddy. Blanche wants some, too.

51
00:05:35,818 --> 00:05:38,753
We gotta have some ice cream
for Blanche.

52
00:05:40,556 --> 00:05:42,217
I don't want anything.

53
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:44,383
What do you think you're trying to do?

54
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,395
I always say it's the parents' fault
in cases like this.

55
00:05:47,463 --> 00:05:49,294
I'm really disappointed.

56
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,829
It sure is a hot day today.

57
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:08,879
You're the lucky one though, Blanche,
really you are.

58
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,852
Someday it's going to be you
that's getting all the attention.

59
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:14,116
And when that happens, I...

60
00:06:15,224 --> 00:06:17,886
I want you to try to be kinder
to Jane and your father...

61
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,928
than they are to you now.

62
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,527
Do you know what I mean?

63
00:06:27,003 --> 00:06:29,528
I hope you'll try and remember that.

64
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,502
I won't forget.

65
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:35,000
You bet I won't forget.

66
00:06:42,285 --> 00:06:44,185
<i>The Seltzer Agency sent you?</i>

67
00:06:45,221 --> 00:06:49,419
<i>- Think there's any chance for me?</i>
<i>- That depends if Mr. Weber likes you.</i>

68
00:06:49,892 --> 00:06:51,723
<i>What type does he like?</i>

69
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:55,557
<i>A lot of personality.</i>

70
00:06:56,265 --> 00:06:58,733
<i>I'll catch on, watch me.</i>

71
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,238
Boy, oh, boy!

72
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:09,044
With my money
I should make a picture like that, huh?

73
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:14,679
<i>Good morning, Mr. Weber. I'm Miss Brent.</i>

74
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,014
<i>Yes. Won't you come</i>
<i>a little closer, please?</i>

75
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,283
She's got a Southern accent
like I got a Southern accent.

76
00:07:25,061 --> 00:07:28,258
I know it's 11:00.
I'll be there when I get there.

77
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,898
<i>- Yes, what is it?</i>
<i>- Mr. Gardner is here to see you.</i>

78
00:07:34,003 --> 00:07:35,436
<i>Gardner?</i>

79
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:37,629
<i>I'll come out.</i>

80
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:41,710
<i>I'll be right back, Miss Brent.</i>
<i>Help yourself to cigarettes.</i>

81
00:07:41,844 --> 00:07:44,574
<i>- Make yourself at home.</i>
<i>- Then the job is mine?</i>

82
00:07:44,947 --> 00:07:46,175
<i>Need you ask?</i>

83
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,144
Kill it.

84
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:31,157
What do you think, Ben?

85
00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:34,026
What's thinking got to do with it, huh?

86
00:08:34,997 --> 00:08:37,022
She stinks, doesn't she?

87
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,963
They say the end's pretty good.
Maybe we should've seen it through.

88
00:08:41,037 --> 00:08:42,026
Please.

89
00:08:42,138 --> 00:08:45,232
<i>You gonna want that picture</i>
<i>again today, Mr. Golden?</i>

90
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:51,504
I don't think anybody's ever gonna
want that picture again.

91
00:08:58,154 --> 00:09:00,520
When the old man hired
them Hudson sisters...

92
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,525
how come he had to hire
the back end of the act, too?

93
00:09:03,593 --> 00:09:06,357
Boy, what a no-talent broad
that Baby Jane is.

94
00:09:06,562 --> 00:09:08,757
Why can't she stay sober?

95
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:13,259
Jane's got her pride.
She's a very sensitive girl.

96
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:17,028
Your very sensitive girl guzzled her way
through six cases of Scotch...

97
00:09:17,106 --> 00:09:18,664
and slugged two studio cops.

98
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:22,233
Not to mention one or two other
less savory items of publicity...

99
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,745
before we got
that so-called epic in the can.

100
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,441
Anyway, you don't have to talk to Jane.

101
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:29,279
If Blanche'd only let us out of
that clause in the contract...

102
00:09:29,352 --> 00:09:31,479
which says we have to make
a picture with Jane...

103
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:33,488
for every picture
that we make with Blanche...

104
00:09:33,556 --> 00:09:35,786
then Baby Jane's contract
won't be any problem.

105
00:09:35,858 --> 00:09:38,725
- You see, that's what we pay lawyers for.
- Possibly.

106
00:09:38,928 --> 00:09:42,125
But somehow,
I can't see Blanche doing that.

107
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:43,356
You know, I don't get it.

108
00:09:43,432 --> 00:09:45,696
Blanche Hudson's the biggest thing
in movies today.

109
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:48,362
She can write her own ticket.
She's got script approval.

110
00:09:48,437 --> 00:09:50,871
She's got more money than she knows
what to do with...

111
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:55,940
You know, she just bought that
tremendous place Valentino used to have.

112
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:59,971
It's gonna take her a year to fix it up
the way she wants it before they move in.

113
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:03,416
Well, I guess they can manage
to struggle on where they are now.

114
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,317
My point is she ought to have
sense enough to know that...

115
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:09,153
she can't make a star
out of Baby Jane again.

116
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:12,425
Blanche doesn't have
any illusions like that.

117
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:16,126
But she's a very fine person, Ben.

118
00:10:16,632 --> 00:10:18,691
She's never gonna forget
those early years...

119
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:21,293
what her sister did for her.
She told me that herself.

120
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,965
Well, I tell you,
she's not doing Baby Jane any favor.

121
00:10:25,574 --> 00:10:28,509
Someday, sooner or later,
that girl's gonna end up in a home.

122
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:33,780
You're going to their party
at the Grove tonight, aren't you?

123
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:37,148
Did you ever try refusing
one of Blanche's invitations?

124
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,786
Do me a favor, Marty, will you?
You talk to Blanche.

125
00:10:39,855 --> 00:10:41,914
Try to make her understand.

126
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:45,124
- I'll do my best.
- Thanks.

127
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:50,925
Remind me to send you one of those
Baby Jane dolls for Christmas.

128
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:53,892
I've got mine for this year.

129
00:10:56,038 --> 00:10:57,938
I don't get it, Marty.

130
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:00,636
What do they make monsters like this for?

131
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,507
For Blanche Hudson.

132
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:08,179
That's our problem.

133
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,138
<i>You go to bed.</i>

134
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,554
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, dear.

135
00:15:23,806 --> 00:15:25,774
<i>Hello, beautiful.</i>
<i>How about a little souvenir?</i>

136
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:29,208
<i>- Let go of that, will you?</i>
<i>- Come on, don't be like that.</i>

137
00:15:32,648 --> 00:15:33,637
<i>Thanks.</i>

138
00:15:40,456 --> 00:15:42,390
<i>Isn't she great?</i>

139
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:47,153
<i>Sorry to break in on this fine old</i>
<i>Blanche Hudson movie, folks.</i>

140
00:15:47,229 --> 00:15:50,528
<i>But you'll be glad I did</i>
<i>when you see what I have right here...</i>

141
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:52,829
<i>for that favorite pooch of yours.</i>

142
00:15:52,901 --> 00:15:54,835
<i>And lliad means quality.</i>

143
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:58,234
<i>So when your dog says, "woof woof"...</i>

144
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,934
<i>- feed him lliad, the classic dog food.</i>
- Shut up!

145
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,171
<i>Lliad will bring the sheen...</i>

146
00:16:04,246 --> 00:16:07,340
Oh, my goodness, I remember
the first time I saw that picture.

147
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,915
I thought it was just wonderful.

148
00:16:10,285 --> 00:16:11,752
When was that?

149
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:16,154
Let's see now, as I recall, your father
took me to see it at the old Majestic.

150
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,191
It was before we were married.

151
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:21,895
She must be about 150 by now.

152
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:25,765
As a matter of fact, dear,
I think Blanche Hudson...

153
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:28,029
is just a few years older than I am.

154
00:16:28,103 --> 00:16:30,765
- Really?
- Yes, dear, really.

155
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,773
Well, how come we never see her around?

156
00:16:33,976 --> 00:16:36,877
We've been living next door to them
for six months now...

157
00:16:36,945 --> 00:16:40,403
and the only one I ever see
is that fat sister slouching around.

158
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:43,781
Don't they ever have company?
I mean, it must be awful.

159
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:48,121
You know, Julie says
that sister is kind of peculiar.

160
00:16:48,957 --> 00:16:51,721
- Did you ever notice that?
- No, I never have.

161
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:54,058
Well, that's what Julie told me.

162
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,460
She said that she was supposed
to be responsible for the accident...

163
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:59,763
that crippled her sister, Blanche.

164
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:02,598
That all happened
a very long time ago, dear.

165
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:06,129
Maybe you shouldn't pay much attention
to everything Julie Fowler says.

166
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:09,075
There's too many people here
with nothing else to do but talk.

167
00:17:09,144 --> 00:17:12,136
Maybe so, but Julie's folks
have lived here a long time.

168
00:17:12,214 --> 00:17:14,045
I guess she should know.

169
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:17,108
Turn up the volume, dear.
We're missing the picture.

170
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,483
<i>- Will you have a little champagne?</i>
<i>- No, thank you.</i>

171
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,189
<i>You wanna tell poppa your troubles?</i>

172
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,425
<i>Somebody you love?</i>

173
00:17:29,932 --> 00:17:32,298
<i>Jack, please try to understand.</i>

174
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:34,965
<i>I married you because...</i>

175
00:17:35,037 --> 00:17:37,870
<i>I was knocked silly and it was a refuge.</i>

176
00:17:39,508 --> 00:17:43,171
<i>I found out tonight that</i>
<i>this boy's in trouble, maybe alone.</i>

177
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,810
<i>And it's blinding me.</i>
<i>I can't think of anything else.</i>

178
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:53,044
He should've held that shot longer.

179
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:57,118
I told him that when we were rehearsing,
also when we shot it.

180
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:59,083
But he wouldn't listen.

181
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:08,563
<i>- How are you?</i>
<i>- Swell.</i>

182
00:18:10,105 --> 00:18:12,471
It's still a pretty good picture.

183
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,837
<i>... and Gemini.</i>

184
00:18:57,085 --> 00:18:59,849
<i>Tommy, you don't have to say anything.</i>

185
00:19:01,323 --> 00:19:03,120
<i>I'll just sit here.</i>

186
00:19:04,526 --> 00:19:06,494
Enjoying yourself?

187
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:09,630
Jane, what are you doing? I was...

188
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:12,691
I was watching.

189
00:19:13,869 --> 00:19:15,427
Then you're an idiot.

190
00:19:15,504 --> 00:19:18,234
I won't have you speak to me like that.

191
00:19:27,282 --> 00:19:29,011
Poor thing.

192
00:19:30,886 --> 00:19:32,786
Poor baby.

193
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:37,955
Quiet down.

194
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:04,177
Good morning, Miss Hudson.
I hope I'm not intruding.

195
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:07,388
I just couldn't resist cutting these flowers
for your sister...

196
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,617
after seeing her show yesterday.

197
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,988
You must be very proud
of her new success...

198
00:20:13,061 --> 00:20:14,892
on television, I mean.

199
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:19,124
I can't tell you how nice it is...

200
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:22,034
to be seeing
all of her old pictures like this.

201
00:20:22,237 --> 00:20:24,102
I'll tell her you said so.

202
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:29,269
You know, my daughter and I
would just love to meet her one day.

203
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:32,638
- Perhaps she could...
- Mrs. Bates, my sister doesn't ever go out.

204
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:35,911
She's not fit to receive visitors.

205
00:20:36,752 --> 00:20:38,743
I am sorry to hear that.

206
00:20:39,288 --> 00:20:41,722
I'd no idea that...

207
00:20:44,293 --> 00:20:46,488
Well, I hope she likes the flowers.

208
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:52,298
Thanks.

209
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:18,424
You miserable...

210
00:22:00,535 --> 00:22:03,993
Jane, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to ring for my breakfast.

211
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:07,166
I was just wondering who
all those people were at the back door.

212
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,005
Wasn't anything.

213
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:13,078
Just that nosy Mrs. Bates
going on about your picture last night.

214
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:16,039
Really? Did she like it?

215
00:22:21,623 --> 00:22:23,181
She liked it.

216
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:30,561
I remember when it first came out,
it had a tremendous reception.

217
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:34,830
The critics described it as brilliant.

218
00:22:36,004 --> 00:22:38,598
Do you remember
what year you made that picture?

219
00:22:38,673 --> 00:22:40,106
But of course.

220
00:22:40,342 --> 00:22:43,641
You must, too.
In 1934, right after I did <i>Moonglow.</i>

221
00:22:44,046 --> 00:22:46,514
I made a picture that year, too.

222
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:51,783
Oh, yes, it was that comedy
directed by Lloyd, wasn't it?

223
00:22:51,987 --> 00:22:54,285
No, it wasn't. It was a love story.

224
00:22:54,356 --> 00:22:56,017
<i>The Longest Night.</i>

225
00:22:56,158 --> 00:22:59,252
Marty McDonald said
it was the best thing I ever did.

226
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,889
They never even released it
in the United States.

227
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:05,798
Golden was very upset.

228
00:23:05,867 --> 00:23:09,303
He told me the company had
a very bad year and they couldn't afford...

229
00:23:09,371 --> 00:23:12,863
No, they didn't. They had a great year.
They didn't want to show my film.

230
00:23:12,941 --> 00:23:17,435
They were too busy giving a big build-up
to that crap you were turning out.

231
00:23:21,683 --> 00:23:23,446
I'll clean the cage.

232
00:23:26,888 --> 00:23:28,549
That would be Elvira.

233
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,880
Come in, Elvira.

234
00:24:05,594 --> 00:24:07,858
- How are you today?
- Fine.

235
00:24:08,497 --> 00:24:10,226
You've seen Jane.

236
00:24:12,634 --> 00:24:14,898
I don't think she's feeling very well today.

237
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:18,633
Did you speak to that Dr. Shelby
about Miss Jane like you said?

238
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,875
No, I haven't yet. It's rather difficult.

239
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,534
I don't want to upset her again
if I can help it.

240
00:24:24,646 --> 00:24:26,807
But she'll be upset anyway, Miss Blanche.

241
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:30,045
And the longer you leave it,
the worse it's gonna be.

242
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,242
I know.

243
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,619
But I was just hoping
it wouldn't be necessary.

244
00:24:35,924 --> 00:24:38,484
I think she seems much better lately.

245
00:24:38,593 --> 00:24:40,185
It's none of my business...

246
00:24:40,262 --> 00:24:42,787
but she's been drinking again.
You know that, don't you?

247
00:24:42,864 --> 00:24:44,627
No, I hadn't noticed.

248
00:24:46,501 --> 00:24:49,026
I don't think it does her any real harm.

249
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,262
I think I understand her.

250
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,837
You do, huh?

251
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,638
Then you ought to take a look at this.

252
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:02,811
- What are these?
- I guess it's what you'd call fan mail.

253
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,715
How kind people are.

254
00:25:09,157 --> 00:25:10,351
You better look at them...

255
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:14,054
and then you can tell me
whether or not you've seen them before.

256
00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:15,756
- Did you read them?
- No.

257
00:25:16,831 --> 00:25:19,959
- But they've been opened.
- That's right, they all have.

258
00:25:20,035 --> 00:25:22,833
And there's one in here
marked "personal."

259
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:33,641
"The other night, my husband and I
watched that lovely old movie of yours:

260
00:25:33,715 --> 00:25:34,943
<i>"Last Honeymoon.</i>

261
00:25:35,016 --> 00:25:37,109
"I remember saying to my husband
at the time...

262
00:25:37,185 --> 00:25:40,621
"that seeing you again
was just like meeting an old friend."

263
00:25:41,423 --> 00:25:44,483
That's charming. That's really charming.

264
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:48,188
The point is you never saw them before,
did you?

265
00:25:49,097 --> 00:25:52,328
- No.
- I thought not.

266
00:25:53,868 --> 00:25:56,701
I'm sorry, I thought you ought to know.

267
00:25:57,505 --> 00:25:59,905
But I don't understand.

268
00:26:00,942 --> 00:26:03,001
Where'd they come from?
Where'd you find them?

269
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:05,069
In the trash barrel, that's where.

270
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:09,981
They're from that television station that's
been running your old movies, aren't they?

271
00:26:17,525 --> 00:26:20,255
- You mean Jane...
- Who else?

272
00:26:22,631 --> 00:26:24,997
She must have thought
they were advertisements.

273
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:27,694
Then why would she open
the one marked "personal"?

274
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:31,034
And what about this?
You might as well see this, too.

275
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,574
Writing those dirty words.

276
00:26:34,643 --> 00:26:38,841
I can't even remember the last time
I saw words like that written down.

277
00:26:39,481 --> 00:26:41,813
But why would she do a thing like this?

278
00:26:41,883 --> 00:26:44,113
You know what makes her
do things like this.

279
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:47,382
She's sick,
and she's not getting any better.

280
00:26:48,056 --> 00:26:51,355
In fact, the last month
she's been getting a lot worse.

281
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,961
If you don't believe me...

282
00:26:55,063 --> 00:26:58,089
then why are you selling this house
and planning to move out?

283
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:00,157
You said this last month...

284
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:03,003
she's been a lot worse.

285
00:27:03,505 --> 00:27:06,497
- Do you think she knows?
- About selling the house?

286
00:27:06,808 --> 00:27:10,107
How could she?
You don't have anything in writing.

287
00:27:10,845 --> 00:27:12,904
We're sisters, Elvira.

288
00:27:13,581 --> 00:27:15,071
We know each other very well.

289
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,481
I think she's jealous...

290
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:20,783
because of those old movies of yours
they're showing on television this week.

291
00:27:20,855 --> 00:27:23,449
Anyway, in six weeks
you'll have to hand over the house...

292
00:27:23,525 --> 00:27:25,493
and then she'll have to know.

293
00:27:26,795 --> 00:27:29,229
How do I tell her? How?

294
00:27:30,098 --> 00:27:34,228
If you'd just speak to that Dr. Shelby,
maybe he could tell her.

295
00:27:39,941 --> 00:27:42,068
No, it ought to be me.

296
00:27:44,112 --> 00:27:46,376
I can't let a stranger tell her.

297
00:27:46,848 --> 00:27:50,409
But he's a doctor, Miss Blanche.
And she's a sick woman.

298
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:55,182
Elvira, you didn't know her
when she was a child.

299
00:27:56,124 --> 00:27:59,651
- When she was young.
- I've seen those pictures she keeps.

300
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:04,592
It wasn't that she was just pretty.

301
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:09,298
She was different. She was so alive.

302
00:28:15,543 --> 00:28:17,738
I was cleaning the cage.

303
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,409
The bird got out.

304
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:22,573
But where is it now?

305
00:28:23,151 --> 00:28:24,982
It flew out the window.

306
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,955
Did you let that bird out
on purpose, Miss Jane?

307
00:28:29,023 --> 00:28:33,858
I just told you, I was cleaning the cage
and the bird flew out the window.

308
00:28:35,997 --> 00:28:37,225
I'm sorry.

309
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:41,866
She did that on purpose.
Believe me, she did it on purpose.

310
00:28:41,936 --> 00:28:43,233
Never mind.

311
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,766
Maybe he'll come back.

312
00:29:00,422 --> 00:29:03,949
You won't change your mind, will you?
About coming to live with me?

313
00:29:04,025 --> 00:29:06,459
You know I don't go back on my word,
Miss Blanche.

314
00:29:06,528 --> 00:29:10,055
But you've got to make up your mind
about finding somewhere for Miss Jane...

315
00:29:10,131 --> 00:29:12,531
where they can look after her properly.

316
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,033
I have.

317
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,838
I have made up my mind.

318
00:29:18,306 --> 00:29:20,672
I'm going to call Dr. Shelby today.

319
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:33,343
I know, Miss Blanche.

320
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:39,988
It's just that I have to be sure
I'm doing the right thing for her.

321
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:09,146
Hello, is this Johnson's?

322
00:30:09,624 --> 00:30:12,491
I want to order some liquor.
It's Jane Hudson.

323
00:30:14,596 --> 00:30:17,827
What do you mean
you can't fill any more orders for me?

324
00:30:18,266 --> 00:30:19,995
My sister did?

325
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,540
Wait a minute, I'll put her on.

326
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:35,915
Blanche, would you speak
to this man from Johnson's?

327
00:30:42,357 --> 00:30:45,793
Hello. Who is this, please?

328
00:30:47,228 --> 00:30:48,957
Oh, yes, Mr. Carlston.

329
00:30:50,465 --> 00:30:53,901
Yes, this is Blanche Hudson.
What seems to be the trouble?

330
00:30:57,906 --> 00:31:00,966
I'm afraid there's been
some misunderstanding.

331
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:06,173
I certainly didn't mean to suggest
that you shouldn't fill any orders for her.

332
00:31:08,716 --> 00:31:11,685
After all, we do pay our bills, don't we?

333
00:31:15,356 --> 00:31:16,914
Yes, fine.

334
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,718
Would you, please?

335
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,521
I'll put her on.

336
00:31:29,737 --> 00:31:31,364
Okay, then?

337
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,468
Good. I'd like to order
six bottles of Scotch...

338
00:31:35,543 --> 00:31:37,477
and three bottles of gin.

339
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:41,440
The same brands. And as soon as possible.

340
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:55,353
I just told Miss Blanche. I'm going
downtown to see a man about jury duty.

341
00:32:01,936 --> 00:32:03,699
I'll be back tomorrow.

342
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,732
Hello?

343
00:33:16,177 --> 00:33:21,979
<i>I've written a letter to Daddy</i>

344
00:33:23,184 --> 00:33:28,520
<i>His address is heaven above</i>

345
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:35,085
<i>I've written, "Dear Daddy, we miss you</i>

346
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:41,029
<i>"And wish you were with us to love!"</i>

347
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:48,333
<i>Instead of a stamp I put kisses</i>

348
00:33:49,577 --> 00:33:52,307
<i>The postman said</i>

349
00:34:09,097 --> 00:34:12,066
<i>The postman says</i>

350
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,835
<i>that's best to do</i>

351
00:34:18,005 --> 00:34:22,601
<i>I've written a letter to Daddy</i>

352
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:31,380
<i>Saying, "I love you"</i>

353
00:34:53,474 --> 00:34:55,840
<i>Now when I'm very good</i>

354
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,407
<i>And do as I am told</i>

355
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,838
<i>I'm Mama 's little angel</i>

356
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:05,010
<i>And Papa says I'm good as gold</i>

357
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,314
<i>But when I'm very bad</i>

358
00:35:08,489 --> 00:35:11,014
<i>And answer back and sass</i>

359
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,956
<i>Then I'm Mama 's little devil</i>

360
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:17,259
<i>And Papa says I've got the brass</i>

361
00:35:19,066 --> 00:35:21,728
<i>Now I wish that you would tell me</i>

362
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:26,096
<i>'Cause I'm much too young to know</i>

363
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,077
All right, Blanche Hudson!

364
00:36:11,819 --> 00:36:14,788
Miss Big Fat Movie Star.

365
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:18,081
Miss Rotten Stinking Actress.

366
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,783
Press a button, ring a bell...

367
00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:24,059
and you think the whole damn world
comes running, don't you?

368
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:28,294
Lunch, Miss Hudson?

369
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:31,634
Why, certainly, Miss Hudson.

370
00:36:32,406 --> 00:36:37,036
I'm sure we can find something
appropriate for you, Miss Hudson!

371
00:37:13,514 --> 00:37:16,483
You brought my lunch. A bit early, isn't it?

372
00:37:16,784 --> 00:37:18,752
Then what were you ringing for?

373
00:37:19,253 --> 00:37:22,313
I wanted to tell you
something's wrong with the telephone.

374
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,324
Maybe it's been
left off the hook downstairs.

375
00:37:24,392 --> 00:37:25,859
Is that so?

376
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,490
Who did you wanna call, Blanche?

377
00:37:29,096 --> 00:37:32,691
Actually, I wanted to call Bert Hanley.

378
00:37:34,035 --> 00:37:36,560
- Our business manager?
- Yes.

379
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:43,266
There's something
I've been meaning to discuss with you.

380
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,174
Well?

381
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:52,749
I'm afraid I have bad news about money.

382
00:37:53,955 --> 00:37:58,449
You see, the point is Bert thinks
we'll probably have to sell the house.

383
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:03,125
Why should we have to
sell the house, Blanche?

384
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:08,032
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

385
00:38:08,836 --> 00:38:11,828
Our financial position
is such that we just...

386
00:38:11,906 --> 00:38:13,168
We can't afford to...

387
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,765
We've got plenty of money invested.
I know.

388
00:38:15,843 --> 00:38:18,038
Yes, that's quite true...

389
00:38:18,779 --> 00:38:22,215
but some of those investments
aren't paying much.

390
00:38:24,485 --> 00:38:28,387
When did our business manager
tell you all this?

391
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,385
Early last week, I think.

392
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,324
He didn't call here last week.
I know that, too.

393
00:38:35,663 --> 00:38:38,632
No, we didn't actually speak
on the telephone.

394
00:38:38,866 --> 00:38:41,130
He wrote me a letter.

395
00:38:41,202 --> 00:38:44,797
He didn't write you any letter.
There hasn't been a letter from his office...

396
00:38:44,872 --> 00:38:48,706
- Yes, Jane, there has.
- You're a liar. You always were.

397
00:38:50,444 --> 00:38:53,572
Bert Hanley didn't write you any letter
or call you on the phone...

398
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:55,308
telling you to sell the house.

399
00:38:55,383 --> 00:38:58,750
You called him four weeks ago
and told him to sell it.

400
00:39:01,055 --> 00:39:03,182
I did nothing of the sort.

401
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:07,894
Don't you think I know everything
that goes on in this house?

402
00:39:11,532 --> 00:39:13,363
You've been spying on me.

403
00:39:14,802 --> 00:39:16,599
What do you think?

404
00:39:17,238 --> 00:39:19,263
You are disgusting.

405
00:39:20,007 --> 00:39:23,738
After all I've done for you, you spy on me,
when all I'm trying to do is help.

406
00:39:23,811 --> 00:39:26,245
Who are you trying to help, Blanche?

407
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,472
What are you planning to do with me
when you've sold the house?

408
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,745
What'd you have in mind?
Some nice little place...

409
00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:33,844
where they could look after me?

410
00:39:46,267 --> 00:39:49,794
Better not tire yourself out
using the phone anymore.

411
00:39:50,438 --> 00:39:53,532
If there are any calls,
I'll take them downstairs.

412
00:39:57,044 --> 00:39:59,672
Eat your lunch, it'll get cold.

413
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:28,528
Jane, please wait.

414
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:37,168
Jane, I want to talk to you. Please.

415
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,713
Jane, I want to talk to...

416
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,705
Telephone, Mother.

417
00:43:15,542 --> 00:43:16,975
All right, dear.

418
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:19,801
- I called this morning and placed an ad.
- Did we give you a reference number?

419
00:44:30,651 --> 00:44:33,677
Here it is. You want to check the copy?

420
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:40,683
That's fine.

421
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:43,457
You want this to go in
the Personal column or the want ads?

422
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:46,624
I always think the Personal column's nicer,
don't you?

423
00:44:49,903 --> 00:44:53,339
That's an eight-line ad. That'll be $6.30.

424
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:03,442
And who's placing this ad?

425
00:45:05,386 --> 00:45:07,980
- We have to know.
- Why, I am.

426
00:45:09,089 --> 00:45:10,989
Yeah, I know, but who for?

427
00:45:11,158 --> 00:45:13,991
When you're placing an ad
for someone to do a job for you...

428
00:45:14,061 --> 00:45:15,926
we have to have your name for the record.

429
00:45:15,996 --> 00:45:18,123
My name is Jane Hudson.

430
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:27,463
Maybe you remember me.
I'm Baby Jane Hudson.

431
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,238
Sure.

432
00:45:31,745 --> 00:45:34,612
Thank you.
This will be in the paper tomorrow.

433
00:45:38,786 --> 00:45:41,516
Who the hell was Baby Jane Hudson?

434
00:45:44,124 --> 00:45:47,491
"Please call Dr. Shelby at OL-61656...

435
00:45:47,561 --> 00:45:50,860
"and ask him to come here
to the house immediately."

436
00:45:59,072 --> 00:46:04,009
Under no circumstances...

437
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:10,116
let my sister see...

438
00:46:11,418 --> 00:46:14,216
the contents...

439
00:46:14,488 --> 00:46:17,184
of this note.

440
00:46:19,626 --> 00:46:22,595
Blanche Hudson.

441
00:47:31,064 --> 00:47:33,032
Miss Hudson, how nice to see you.

442
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,330
- I was just going to call on you.
- Why?

443
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:38,734
I wanted to ask you about
the flowers I brought over for your sister.

444
00:47:38,805 --> 00:47:41,000
They don't last very long
this time of year...

445
00:47:41,074 --> 00:47:43,668
and I thought perhaps
you'd like some more.

446
00:47:45,412 --> 00:47:48,870
- You could've saved yourself the trouble.
- But it's no trouble at all.

447
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,474
I've just been cutting some,
that's why I came over.

448
00:47:51,552 --> 00:47:54,749
- I always think it's nice to have flowers...
- Mrs. Bates...

449
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:58,888
I guess if my sister needed flowers,
we could afford to buy them.

450
00:48:42,736 --> 00:48:45,728
What's the matter, Mother?
You look like you've been in a fight.

451
00:48:45,806 --> 00:48:47,774
I'm not sure that I haven't been.

452
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:51,038
That Jane Hudson makes me so mad,
I could kill her!

453
00:48:52,045 --> 00:48:53,876
That's a good idea.

454
00:48:54,081 --> 00:48:55,571
What'll we use?

455
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,208
Did you have a nice drive?

456
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,334
What are you talking about?

457
00:49:57,411 --> 00:50:00,471
Nothing, dear. It's so long
since you were out of the house...

458
00:50:00,547 --> 00:50:03,209
I thought perhaps you'd gone
for a drive or something.

459
00:50:03,283 --> 00:50:05,217
You know, I was thinking...

460
00:50:06,053 --> 00:50:09,181
it's ever so long since we had a talk.

461
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:13,318
You know, a real talk
about the future and everything.

462
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,824
I didn't want you to be worried
about the house.

463
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:23,028
Even if I do have to sell it,
we'll still be together.

464
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,901
Blanche, you're not going to
sell this house.

465
00:50:26,973 --> 00:50:28,873
Daddy bought this house.

466
00:50:29,176 --> 00:50:31,110
And he bought it for me.

467
00:50:33,013 --> 00:50:35,846
You don't think I remember that, do you?

468
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:39,451
You're wrong, Jane. You've just forgotten.

469
00:50:40,721 --> 00:50:44,487
I bought this house for the two of us
when I signed my first contract.

470
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:47,252
You don't think I remember anything,
do you?

471
00:50:48,395 --> 00:50:50,386
There're a whole lot of things I remember.

472
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,591
And you never paid for this house.

473
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:57,800
Baby Jane Hudson made the money
that paid for this house, that's who.

474
00:50:58,171 --> 00:51:00,264
You don't know what you're saying.

475
00:51:04,177 --> 00:51:06,702
You aren't ever gonna sell this house.

476
00:51:07,781 --> 00:51:12,081
And you aren't ever gonna leave it, either.

477
00:51:26,266 --> 00:51:29,758
Do you remember when I first came back
after the accident?

478
00:51:35,075 --> 00:51:38,238
You promised you wouldn't ever talk
about that again.

479
00:51:38,311 --> 00:51:39,869
I know I did...

480
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,372
but I'm still in this chair.

481
00:51:42,482 --> 00:51:45,576
After all those years, I'm still in this chair.

482
00:51:45,952 --> 00:51:49,046
Doesn't that give you
some kind of responsibility?

483
00:51:49,489 --> 00:51:53,118
Jane, I'm just trying to explain to you
how things really are.

484
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:55,593
You wouldn't be able to do
these awful things to me...

485
00:51:55,662 --> 00:51:57,789
if I weren't still in this chair.

486
00:52:02,569 --> 00:52:06,198
But you are, Blanche. You are in that chair.

487
00:52:07,107 --> 00:52:11,908
And tell me, what are these awful things
I'm supposed to be doing to you?

488
00:52:13,814 --> 00:52:15,907
Well, I meant...

489
00:52:17,284 --> 00:52:19,775
you wouldn't have to work so hard.

490
00:52:20,287 --> 00:52:22,312
And I was thinking...

491
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:25,384
maybe Elvira could come in more often.

492
00:52:26,293 --> 00:52:28,784
Maybe she could even live with us.

493
00:52:29,162 --> 00:52:31,426
We don't need Elvira.

494
00:52:32,766 --> 00:52:34,791
But you get so tired...

495
00:52:36,169 --> 00:52:38,660
There's so much to do,
and you're not well.

496
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:40,964
Maybe you're right.

497
00:52:42,275 --> 00:52:45,073
Maybe I should get a checkup
or something.

498
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,506
That would be wonderful.

499
00:52:49,783 --> 00:52:53,241
Perhaps we can find a really good doctor.

500
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:58,524
We could get hold of
that nice Dr. Shelby, couldn't we?

501
00:53:00,327 --> 00:53:01,988
Let's see...

502
00:53:02,796 --> 00:53:04,787
what's his number again?

503
00:53:14,541 --> 00:53:17,032
"And under no circumstances...

504
00:53:17,577 --> 00:53:21,809
"tell my sister the contents of this note."

505
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:26,048
It's not me that needs a doctor, Blanche.

506
00:55:28,008 --> 00:55:29,669
Hello, lovey.

507
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,772
Now, don't stop for me.

508
00:55:33,179 --> 00:55:34,840
What did the doctor say?

509
00:55:35,815 --> 00:55:40,275
He says it's no use my trying to go back
to work for another six months.

510
00:55:41,021 --> 00:55:43,182
Didn't he even give you
anything new to take?

511
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:45,190
He says it's arthritis.

512
00:55:45,525 --> 00:55:49,859
And the only thing for me to do is
not to try and work until it clears up.

513
00:55:50,363 --> 00:55:53,491
Did he suggest what we're going to use
for money in the meantime?

514
00:55:53,566 --> 00:55:57,730
No, dear. But he's ever such a nice man.

515
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:02,302
Now, lovey, never you mind, anyway.

516
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:06,105
You know, we've still got a bit of savings.

517
00:56:07,013 --> 00:56:09,413
You're my little worrier.

518
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:13,719
That's nice.
You've found something, have you?

519
00:56:13,853 --> 00:56:17,846
You don't have to get so excited.
You haven't even seen what it is yet.

520
00:56:18,391 --> 00:56:20,951
No, dear, but it's a possibility, isn't it?

521
00:56:21,027 --> 00:56:24,326
I mean, there aren't that many jobs
that'd be suitable...

522
00:56:24,397 --> 00:56:27,264
for someone with your qualifications.

523
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:29,858
What qualifications?

524
00:56:31,571 --> 00:56:34,506
Well, you know, serious music and all that.

525
00:56:35,275 --> 00:56:38,540
This sounds like just the ticket, doesn't it?

526
00:56:42,115 --> 00:56:44,515
- You're gonna call?
- Call who?

527
00:56:45,285 --> 00:56:46,877
These people.

528
00:56:47,887 --> 00:56:49,787
- Might as well.
- Now?

529
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:54,158
Well, it wouldn't be a lot of bloody use
calling next week, would it?

530
00:56:54,227 --> 00:56:55,455
No, dear.

531
00:56:59,866 --> 00:57:03,233
Mom, I'll tell you what.
Why don't you call for me?

532
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:06,361
Tell them you're my secretary
or something.

533
00:57:06,439 --> 00:57:08,805
All right, dear, I'll do that.

534
00:57:09,442 --> 00:57:12,104
Listen, I won't let on who I am.

535
00:57:12,812 --> 00:57:16,646
You see, I'll just tell them,
"I'm Mr. Flagg's seck-er-tary."

536
00:57:16,716 --> 00:57:18,377
Secretary.

537
00:57:22,989 --> 00:57:26,322
Do you know, I do believe your old mom...

538
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,255
would be a jolly good secretary at that.

539
00:57:30,763 --> 00:57:32,424
Don't you think?

540
00:57:46,746 --> 00:57:47,974
Hello?

541
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:51,145
This is Jane Hudson.

542
00:57:53,153 --> 00:57:54,916
About the ad.

543
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,284
Who is this?

544
00:57:58,358 --> 00:58:01,521
This is Mr. Flagg's secretary.

545
00:58:02,195 --> 00:58:03,856
His secretary.

546
00:58:05,798 --> 00:58:07,823
Mr. Flagg is very interested...

547
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,699
and he'd like to know
if he could have an appointment.

548
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:14,604
I think you'll find he's very well-qualified.

549
00:58:15,808 --> 00:58:18,800
Sure, I'd be glad to give Mr. Flagg
an appointment.

550
00:58:19,612 --> 00:58:21,773
Well, now, let me see...

551
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:23,943
how about 4:00 this afternoon?

552
00:58:26,819 --> 00:58:29,185
I think that would be fine.

553
00:58:30,957 --> 00:58:33,289
Well, I'll be expecting him then.

554
00:58:34,327 --> 00:58:35,487
Thanks.

555
00:58:41,668 --> 00:58:43,829
It's all fixed, lovey.

556
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:48,563
Your old mom's managed everything...

557
00:58:48,641 --> 00:58:50,131
hasn't she?

558
00:58:57,350 --> 00:58:58,544
Oh, shut up!

559
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:05,552
Stop it!

560
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:13,363
- What do you want this time?
- Who was on the telephone?

561
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:15,866
None of your business.
What were you ringing for?

562
00:59:15,935 --> 00:59:17,300
I'm hungry, Jane.

563
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:20,635
Of course you're hungry.
You didn't eat your dinner.

564
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,567
But you forgot my breakfast.

565
00:59:23,743 --> 00:59:26,041
I didn't forget your breakfast.

566
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,644
I didn't bring your breakfast...

567
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:31,306
because you didn't eat your din-din.

568
00:59:35,255 --> 00:59:36,950
We're right back where we started.

569
00:59:37,056 --> 00:59:40,253
When I was on the stage,
you had to depend on me for everything.

570
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:42,886
Even the food you ate came from me.

571
00:59:43,062 --> 00:59:45,690
Now you have to depend on me
for your food again.

572
00:59:45,765 --> 00:59:48,199
So, you see,
we're right back where we started.

573
00:59:48,268 --> 00:59:50,998
Why are you doing this to me? Why?

574
00:59:52,238 --> 00:59:53,569
Doing what?

575
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:56,803
Making me afraid to eat,
trying to make me starve myself.

576
00:59:58,044 --> 00:59:59,409
Don't be silly.

577
00:59:59,946 --> 01:00:02,039
If you starve, you die.

578
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:05,947
I don't know what you're talking about.
You really must be sick.

579
01:00:08,121 --> 01:00:10,521
Did you ever stop to think that...

580
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:13,854
if anything happened to me,
I mean, anything bad...

581
01:00:14,927 --> 01:00:17,020
there wouldn't be any money for you?

582
01:00:17,096 --> 01:00:19,257
I wouldn't be here to sign the checks.

583
01:00:19,332 --> 01:00:21,630
You wouldn't even have pocket money.

584
01:00:22,402 --> 01:00:24,393
Did you ever think of that?

585
01:00:25,138 --> 01:00:27,368
Yeah, I've thought about that.

586
01:00:32,011 --> 01:00:34,104
Why didn't you eat your dinner?

587
01:00:35,448 --> 01:00:38,246
Because I'm afraid. You made me afraid.

588
01:00:39,585 --> 01:00:43,180
I thought you were supposed to be
the big girl in this family.

589
01:00:46,292 --> 01:00:48,123
Nothing wrong with it.

590
01:00:48,995 --> 01:00:51,122
You're just a neurotic, Blanche.

591
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,428
You know that? You're just a neurotic.

592
01:01:03,176 --> 01:01:05,371
- Good morning, Elvira.
- Good morning.

593
01:01:13,386 --> 01:01:16,412
- Please, Jane, I'm so hungry.
- I have to go now.

594
01:01:16,489 --> 01:01:18,457
But just a little, please.

595
01:01:18,691 --> 01:01:22,821
No. You didn't eat your din-din,
so you'll have to wait till lunchtime.

596
01:01:23,062 --> 01:01:25,428
Jane, please, don't do this to me.

597
01:01:25,565 --> 01:01:27,499
Jane, please!

598
01:01:51,424 --> 01:01:54,325
- Good morning, Elvira.
- Good morning, Miss Jane.

599
01:01:55,895 --> 01:01:57,726
I wanna talk to you.

600
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:00,694
- I want to apologize.
- Apologize?

601
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,731
I wasn't feeling so well yesterday,
so I was unkind to you.

602
01:02:05,438 --> 01:02:07,235
I want to make it up.

603
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:09,998
I got up this morning and fixed the house.

604
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:13,510
So you can have the whole day off.

605
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,811
Here's your $15.

606
01:02:16,349 --> 01:02:18,442
Thanks, but does Miss...

607
01:02:18,518 --> 01:02:21,612
What I mean is does Miss Blanche know
about my taking the day off?

608
01:02:21,687 --> 01:02:23,177
Sure, she knows.

609
01:02:23,856 --> 01:02:25,983
All right, if you say so.

610
01:02:26,426 --> 01:02:28,485
See you next Tuesday then.

611
01:02:29,462 --> 01:02:31,089
Have a good time.

612
01:02:31,964 --> 01:02:33,090
Goodbye.

613
01:02:43,876 --> 01:02:45,036
Bye.

614
01:04:09,517 --> 01:04:12,509
- Who was that at the door earlier?
- Elvira.

615
01:04:13,054 --> 01:04:15,113
Where is she now? In the kitchen?

616
01:04:16,424 --> 01:04:18,483
No. I gave her the day off.

617
01:04:19,027 --> 01:04:21,723
She has a pretty hard time, considering.

618
01:04:21,863 --> 01:04:23,990
I told her to come back next week.

619
01:04:31,573 --> 01:04:34,041
You know we got rats in the cellar?

620
01:07:08,463 --> 01:07:09,953
Good afternoon.

621
01:07:14,068 --> 01:07:15,228
Mr. Flagg?

622
01:07:15,603 --> 01:07:17,901
Yes, I'm Edwin Flagg.

623
01:07:19,574 --> 01:07:23,601
I have an appointment
with a Miss Hudson for 4:00.

624
01:07:24,379 --> 01:07:26,244
I'm Jane Hudson.

625
01:07:27,348 --> 01:07:30,476
My, you're right on time, aren't you?

626
01:07:30,551 --> 01:07:32,348
Yes, I believe I am.

627
01:07:33,688 --> 01:07:34,950
Come in.

628
01:07:55,176 --> 01:07:57,701
We can talk here in the living room.

629
01:08:02,884 --> 01:08:07,617
I say, what a perfectly charming room.

630
01:08:09,791 --> 01:08:12,988
- So you're Edwin Flagg?
- Yes, that's right.

631
01:08:14,162 --> 01:08:16,323
I'll bring you some tea. You like tea?

632
01:08:16,397 --> 01:08:19,161
Oh, yes. I'm quite fond of tea.

633
01:08:19,267 --> 01:08:21,667
You must've guessed that I'm English.

634
01:08:21,969 --> 01:08:24,597
Oh, really? How nice for you.

635
01:09:37,411 --> 01:09:39,345
Here, let me help you.

636
01:09:39,714 --> 01:09:42,979
That's a terribly big burden
for such a little girl.

637
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,849
Thank you. You're very kind.

638
01:09:47,655 --> 01:09:50,283
It's so hot today.
Did you drive here in your car?

639
01:09:50,358 --> 01:09:52,690
Well, actually I took a cab.

640
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:56,787
It's a bit of a nuisance,
but I had to put my car in for servicing.

641
01:09:57,165 --> 01:09:58,860
- Cream or lemon?
- Cream.

642
01:10:01,002 --> 01:10:02,230
Sugar?

643
01:10:07,809 --> 01:10:10,004
My, it looks good.

644
01:10:11,512 --> 01:10:15,346
I always think it's nice to break bread...

645
01:10:15,416 --> 01:10:18,749
- with strangers, don't you?
- Oh, yes, indeed.

646
01:10:20,388 --> 01:10:24,290
I don't think you actually mentioned
the exact nature of...

647
01:10:24,358 --> 01:10:25,916
I've been retired for some time now.

648
01:10:25,993 --> 01:10:29,258
I've been taking care of someone
in my family who's sick.

649
01:10:29,363 --> 01:10:31,627
And now you're free to return
to your profession?

650
01:10:31,699 --> 01:10:32,791
Yes.

651
01:10:33,434 --> 01:10:34,901
And what exactly...

652
01:10:35,436 --> 01:10:38,667
I mean, I take it you are a soloist.
Some instrument?

653
01:10:41,175 --> 01:10:43,575
I wonder if you can guess who I am.

654
01:10:47,448 --> 01:10:49,109
Can you give me a hint?

655
01:10:49,183 --> 01:10:52,448
Well, it's not really fair to make you guess.

656
01:10:53,521 --> 01:10:55,716
I'm Baby Jane Hudson.

657
01:11:04,799 --> 01:11:08,166
Do you mean
you're really the Baby Jane Hudson?

658
01:11:08,903 --> 01:11:10,165
Yes, I am.

659
01:11:10,238 --> 01:11:13,571
And I'm going to revive my act
exactly as I used to do it.

660
01:11:13,641 --> 01:11:16,633
Of course, some arrangements
will have to be brought up to date.

661
01:11:16,711 --> 01:11:19,202
Music changes so much, doesn't it?

662
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,180
And they're desperate for new acts.

663
01:11:21,249 --> 01:11:23,979
Television, Las Vegas,
and all the clubs and...

664
01:11:24,051 --> 01:11:27,680
There are a lot of people
who remember me, lots of them.

665
01:11:28,623 --> 01:11:30,614
I don't see how you could fail.

666
01:11:37,498 --> 01:11:39,591
You know, I had a kind of a feeling...

667
01:11:39,667 --> 01:11:42,431
the minute I opened that door
and saw you standing there.

668
01:11:42,503 --> 01:11:45,199
I just knew we were going to be friends.

669
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:47,566
I've been thinking about costumes.

670
01:11:47,642 --> 01:11:48,870
Costumes?

671
01:11:48,943 --> 01:11:51,343
Yes. I took some of my old ones
down to be copied.

672
01:11:51,412 --> 01:11:53,972
- You think that's a good idea?
- Of course.

673
01:11:54,382 --> 01:11:56,714
But I don't quite remember...

674
01:11:56,817 --> 01:11:59,047
How silly of me, Edwin. How could you?

675
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,611
But I do want your opinion. I really do.

676
01:12:01,889 --> 01:12:04,323
All my scrapbooks and stuff
are in the rehearsal room.

677
01:12:04,392 --> 01:12:07,418
You can look at them
and tell me what you think.

678
01:12:08,329 --> 01:12:11,492
- You'd like to see them, wouldn't you?
- Well, of course.

679
01:12:12,733 --> 01:12:15,896
I wish Daddy could be here right now.

680
01:12:16,771 --> 01:12:19,797
"You can never lose your talent,"
he used to tell me.

681
01:12:19,874 --> 01:12:23,571
"You can lose everything else
but you can't lose your talent."

682
01:12:30,985 --> 01:12:33,954
I think you'll find these clippings
very interesting.

683
01:12:34,021 --> 01:12:36,387
Daddy saved them for me
from the very first.

684
01:12:36,457 --> 01:12:38,891
He used to put them in special books.

685
01:12:41,429 --> 01:12:43,659
I always liked that picture.

686
01:12:45,099 --> 01:12:46,589
It's so sad.

687
01:12:54,875 --> 01:12:57,173
- Will you excuse me?
- Certainly.

688
01:13:09,924 --> 01:13:13,087
You always spoil everything, don't you?

689
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:16,891
- No, Jane. I just wanted to know...
- Who is down there? I'll tell you.

690
01:13:16,964 --> 01:13:19,865
I got a friend down there.
Someone who's come to see me.

691
01:13:19,934 --> 01:13:22,926
He doesn't even know you exist.
And you don't like that, do you?

692
01:13:23,004 --> 01:13:25,598
You're wrong.
I've always wanted you to have friends.

693
01:13:25,673 --> 01:13:28,665
- That's what I've always wanted.
- Then how come I never had any?

694
01:13:28,743 --> 01:13:30,233
Well, maybe you weren't...

695
01:13:30,311 --> 01:13:32,802
I mean, maybe you were
just too independent.

696
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,313
No, that's not why.

697
01:13:34,382 --> 01:13:36,782
You always stopped me
from having friends, that's why!

698
01:13:36,851 --> 01:13:38,785
Not anymore, Jane.

699
01:13:39,086 --> 01:13:42,522
I'm pleased that you have a friend.
That's what you need.

700
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:45,124
- Sure!
- I was just hoping maybe...

701
01:13:45,226 --> 01:13:48,957
I could meet him and we could have
a nice talk, just the three of us.

702
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:50,497
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

703
01:13:50,564 --> 01:13:52,964
Then you could tell him
a whole lot of lies about me.

704
01:13:53,034 --> 01:13:54,365
Scare him off...

705
01:13:54,802 --> 01:13:57,362
or maybe have him for yourself.

706
01:14:37,711 --> 01:14:41,738
<i>I've written a letter to Daddy</i>

707
01:14:42,917 --> 01:14:47,013
<i>His address is heaven above</i>

708
01:14:48,022 --> 01:14:50,217
That's wonderful!

709
01:15:02,236 --> 01:15:06,366
<i>I've written a letter to Daddy</i>

710
01:15:07,141 --> 01:15:11,305
<i>His address is heaven above</i>

711
01:15:13,114 --> 01:15:17,312
<i>I've written, "Dear Daddy, we miss you</i>

712
01:15:18,486 --> 01:15:23,287
<i>"And wish you were with us to love!"</i>

713
01:15:25,326 --> 01:15:29,319
<i>Instead of a stamp I put kisses</i>

714
01:15:30,197 --> 01:15:34,861
<i>The postman says that's best to do</i>

715
01:15:36,971 --> 01:15:40,168
<i>I've written a letter to Daddy</i>

716
01:15:40,875 --> 01:15:46,279
<i>Saying, "I love you"</i>

717
01:16:39,567 --> 01:16:43,503
<i>I've written a letter to Daddy</i>

718
01:16:43,837 --> 01:16:48,797
<i>Saying, "I love you"</i>

719
01:17:09,196 --> 01:17:11,255
Edwin, you certainly can play, can't you?

720
01:17:11,332 --> 01:17:15,063
- And you certainly can sing.
- Oh, thank you.

721
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:17,501
I can see you've done
this kind of work before.

722
01:17:17,571 --> 01:17:18,970
No, not really.

723
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:21,701
Actually, I've spent most of my time
on serious music.

724
01:17:21,775 --> 01:17:23,402
Composing, and that sort of thing.

725
01:17:23,477 --> 01:17:25,945
So this will be your first contact
with show business?

726
01:17:26,013 --> 01:17:27,344
Not exactly.

727
01:17:27,414 --> 01:17:30,440
You see, my father was quite well-known
as an actor.

728
01:17:30,618 --> 01:17:33,382
In the movies? Maybe I worked with him.

729
01:17:33,454 --> 01:17:35,718
I shouldn't think so.

730
01:17:35,789 --> 01:17:38,314
He's been dead quite a long time now.

731
01:17:38,559 --> 01:17:41,392
I lost my daddy
when I was quite young, too.

732
01:17:41,462 --> 01:17:44,727
Of course, he was more
in the classical tradition as an actor.

733
01:17:44,798 --> 01:17:46,595
Shakespeare and that sort of thing.

734
01:17:46,667 --> 01:17:49,795
People used to say Daddy
could've been a star in his own right.

735
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:52,634
- He was a musician, too.
- What instrument?

736
01:17:52,706 --> 01:17:54,367
Piano and banjo.

737
01:17:56,944 --> 01:17:59,378
That's very interesting.

738
01:17:59,446 --> 01:18:02,438
The banjo's a very native
American instrument.

739
01:18:02,783 --> 01:18:05,183
Of course, my father was British...

740
01:18:05,319 --> 01:18:09,050
but he never really got a chance
out here in Hollywood.

741
01:18:09,356 --> 01:18:11,017
That's too bad.

742
01:18:22,603 --> 01:18:23,729
It's funny, really.

743
01:18:23,804 --> 01:18:27,331
Because actually he came from
a rather distinguished family, socially...

744
01:18:27,408 --> 01:18:31,242
and yet nearly all the parts he had
were playing menials, butlers and such.

745
01:18:31,312 --> 01:18:32,939
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

746
01:18:33,781 --> 01:18:36,614
I don't think my mother
ever really appreciated...

747
01:18:36,684 --> 01:18:38,481
what he was trying to do.

748
01:18:38,552 --> 01:18:40,179
I know what you mean.

749
01:18:40,421 --> 01:18:43,948
It's very hard for an artist
when people don't understand.

750
01:18:44,158 --> 01:18:47,559
- I remember when...
- I sometimes try to explain to her...

751
01:18:47,628 --> 01:18:49,994
that if you're going to produce
anything decent...

752
01:18:50,064 --> 01:18:52,362
in the way of serious music...

753
01:18:52,433 --> 01:18:55,163
you must have the right atmosphere.

754
01:18:56,003 --> 01:18:58,767
But, of course,
Dehlia can't understand that.

755
01:18:59,373 --> 01:19:02,001
Dehlia? Who's Dehlia?

756
01:19:02,843 --> 01:19:06,438
You might not think it to look at her,
but she is my mother.

757
01:19:08,682 --> 01:19:10,877
For a minute, I thought you had...

758
01:19:10,951 --> 01:19:14,352
a wife or a lady friend
tucked away somewhere.

759
01:19:14,621 --> 01:19:18,717
Oh, no. Nothing like that.

760
01:19:18,792 --> 01:19:21,818
How much were you actually
thinking of paying?

761
01:19:22,229 --> 01:19:23,457
Paying?

762
01:19:28,168 --> 01:19:29,726
What do you think?

763
01:19:33,674 --> 01:19:35,665
How about $100?

764
01:19:36,176 --> 01:19:38,235
A week, of course.

765
01:19:41,215 --> 01:19:44,514
- I think that would be fair.
- Then that's settled.

766
01:19:44,585 --> 01:19:46,576
I don't like talking about money, do you?

767
01:19:46,653 --> 01:19:50,350
No. It's not that important, is it?
Not like relationships between people.

768
01:19:50,424 --> 01:19:53,518
But the thing is, if I'm going to move out
and give up my pupils...

769
01:19:53,594 --> 01:19:55,459
I'll have to know for sure.

770
01:19:55,696 --> 01:19:57,857
When were you thinking of starting?

771
01:19:58,665 --> 01:20:01,429
Just when could you let me
have some money?

772
01:20:02,403 --> 01:20:06,840
Well, I've got some family matters
to take care of.

773
01:20:08,175 --> 01:20:10,973
That should take about a week or so.

774
01:20:11,245 --> 01:20:15,204
Then I couldn't see why
we couldn't start rehearsing right away.

775
01:20:17,818 --> 01:20:19,342
Tell you what, Edwin...

776
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:23,322
I'll pay you first thing Wednesday,
a month in advance.

777
01:20:25,426 --> 01:20:26,654
It's done.

778
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:29,590
How about going to dinner
somewhere nice?

779
01:20:29,663 --> 01:20:31,392
That sounds fine.

780
01:20:31,632 --> 01:20:35,193
Why don't you come with me now?
I've got to pick up my costumes...

781
01:20:35,269 --> 01:20:37,999
and then we could go on to dinner
from there.

782
01:20:38,071 --> 01:20:42,440
I promised Dehlia I'd be home for supper.

783
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:45,940
Well, I'll drive you home then.

784
01:20:47,214 --> 01:20:49,045
I'm so excited!

785
01:20:49,316 --> 01:20:52,945
You know, I know everything
is going to go just marvelously.

786
01:20:53,554 --> 01:20:56,580
I have to go up and change.
I won't be a minute.

787
01:21:17,511 --> 01:21:20,605
This is really
a rather charming neighborhood.

788
01:21:23,917 --> 01:21:26,681
Yes, I've always found it very pleasant.

789
01:23:33,981 --> 01:23:36,211
I just can't wait to get started rehearsing.

790
01:23:36,283 --> 01:23:38,751
We're going to be a great team,
the two of us.

791
01:23:38,819 --> 01:23:40,684
I'm sure we are.

792
01:23:42,489 --> 01:23:45,049
I'll see you Wednesday. Bye.

793
01:26:39,599 --> 01:26:42,295
This is Blanche, Blanche Hudson.

794
01:26:42,836 --> 01:26:46,169
I need your help. Is the doctor there?
I must talk to him.

795
01:26:46,506 --> 01:26:48,565
He's with a patient right now.

796
01:26:48,909 --> 01:26:51,537
But I have to talk to him. I've got to.

797
01:26:52,112 --> 01:26:54,740
Hold on, please.
I'll see if I can interrupt him.

798
01:26:57,551 --> 01:26:59,542
- Dr. Shelby?
- Yes, Blanche.

799
01:26:59,619 --> 01:27:02,417
Miss Hill tells me you're a little upset.
What's the trouble?

800
01:27:03,623 --> 01:27:06,353
You must come. I need you here.

801
01:27:12,732 --> 01:27:15,166
No. It's about my sister.

802
01:27:15,535 --> 01:27:18,265
I need your help. I need you here.

803
01:27:18,572 --> 01:27:20,130
Here at the house.

804
01:27:20,540 --> 01:27:23,236
No. It's nothing like that.

805
01:27:23,977 --> 01:27:26,241
It's the way she's behaving.

806
01:27:27,214 --> 01:27:31,241
You've got to come over right away.
Please, before she comes back.

807
01:27:31,318 --> 01:27:32,615
I don't quite understand.

808
01:27:32,686 --> 01:27:35,621
Is this some kind of emotional
disturbance you're talking about?

809
01:27:35,689 --> 01:27:39,147
Yes, she's emotionally disturbed.

810
01:27:39,392 --> 01:27:41,223
She's unbalanced.

811
01:27:42,963 --> 01:27:44,988
I don't know, Doctor.

812
01:27:45,799 --> 01:27:48,131
Are you trying to tell me
that she's violent?

813
01:27:49,936 --> 01:27:51,426
Yes, she is.

814
01:28:08,655 --> 01:28:10,623
I'm not sure.

815
01:28:23,103 --> 01:28:25,697
Very well.
We aren't getting anywhere like this.

816
01:28:25,772 --> 01:28:27,501
I'll come over right away.

817
01:28:30,310 --> 01:28:31,334
That was...

818
01:28:32,579 --> 01:28:34,444
I know who it was.

819
01:28:34,981 --> 01:28:36,608
No, Jane, it really was.

820
01:28:36,683 --> 01:28:38,947
And I know what you're trying to do.

821
01:28:39,019 --> 01:28:41,954
I'm not trying to do anything.
Honestly, Jane.

822
01:29:44,651 --> 01:29:46,846
This is Blanche Hudson again.

823
01:29:47,187 --> 01:29:49,155
Could I speak to the doctor?

824
01:29:49,222 --> 01:29:52,658
Yes, certainly. Hold on, please.
I'll try and catch him.

825
01:30:01,668 --> 01:30:04,068
Hello, Blanche. I'm on my way now.

826
01:30:04,337 --> 01:30:06,931
I'm so glad I caught you in time.

827
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:10,366
Dr. Shelby, we're not going to
need you after all.

828
01:30:11,878 --> 01:30:15,507
I know, but Jane has gone
to another doctor.

829
01:30:16,449 --> 01:30:19,976
- Another doctor?
- Yes. Another doctor.

830
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:23,680
Well, if she's chosen to go
to someone else...

831
01:30:25,525 --> 01:30:28,688
After all,
we really can't interfere, can we...

832
01:30:28,762 --> 01:30:31,322
if Jane's chosen to go to another doctor?

833
01:30:32,132 --> 01:30:33,929
I'm very sorry.

834
01:30:40,573 --> 01:30:43,041
Goodbye, Doctor.

835
01:31:22,348 --> 01:31:24,942
I thought I told you
not to come back until next week.

836
01:31:25,018 --> 01:31:27,987
Yes, but I had a free day,
so I thought I'd come by and see...

837
01:31:28,054 --> 01:31:30,579
- if there was anything needed doing.
- There isn't.

838
01:31:30,657 --> 01:31:33,091
So you could've saved yourself
the trouble.

839
01:31:33,159 --> 01:31:36,094
I was gonna write you a note,
but now I may as well tell you.

840
01:31:36,196 --> 01:31:38,494
We're not gonna be needing you anymore.

841
01:31:38,565 --> 01:31:41,625
- But I don't understand.
- We're closing up the house.

842
01:31:41,701 --> 01:31:44,101
Blanche wants to take a smaller place
at the beach.

843
01:31:44,170 --> 01:31:47,298
The doctor thinks that's best for her
so that's what we'll do.

844
01:31:47,373 --> 01:31:50,706
Don't worry, you'll be paid for today.
I'll send you a check.

845
01:31:50,777 --> 01:31:54,713
I'm not worried about any pay.
I'd like to see Miss Blanche before I go.

846
01:31:55,748 --> 01:31:58,080
Well, you can't. She's asleep.

847
01:32:00,153 --> 01:32:02,417
That's all right. I don't mind waiting.

848
01:32:02,489 --> 01:32:05,947
I do, I've got to leave,
so just give me the keys to the house.

849
01:32:08,061 --> 01:32:11,189
I'm sorry, I don't have the keys.
I must've left them at home.

850
01:32:11,264 --> 01:32:13,357
Anyway, go. You're fired.

851
01:33:46,492 --> 01:33:47,959
Miss Blanche?

852
01:34:02,809 --> 01:34:05,607
Miss Blanche, are you awake?

853
01:34:28,067 --> 01:34:30,126
Are you all right in there?

854
01:34:33,406 --> 01:34:35,931
Wait now, and I'll go find the key.

855
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:41,874
Thank you.

856
01:34:45,418 --> 01:34:47,978
- Good morning, Miss Hudson.
- Good morning.

857
01:34:48,454 --> 01:34:50,684
How's Miss Blanche these days?

858
01:34:50,957 --> 01:34:52,788
She's just fine.

859
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:55,489
Your deposit slip?

860
01:34:56,195 --> 01:34:59,392
Well, Blanche wanted me
to get it all in cash this time.

861
01:34:59,465 --> 01:35:03,231
- I guess she has some special reason.
- Yes, but doesn't she normally...

862
01:35:03,303 --> 01:35:06,636
I mean, if she isn't going to deposit
her monthly check...

863
01:35:06,706 --> 01:35:09,971
she usually gives us a call
and tells us what she wants us to do.

864
01:35:10,043 --> 01:35:12,170
- Didn't she call?
- I don't think so.

865
01:35:12,545 --> 01:35:16,379
I guess she must still be asleep.
She gave me that check last night.

866
01:35:16,449 --> 01:35:18,815
I see. Just a moment, please.

867
01:35:33,900 --> 01:35:36,733
I guess that'll be all right, Miss Hudson.

868
01:35:37,337 --> 01:35:40,135
- Fifties and twenties all right?
- Yes, please.

869
01:35:46,879 --> 01:35:48,744
- There you are.
- Thank you.

870
01:35:48,815 --> 01:35:50,009
Bye now.

871
01:35:57,757 --> 01:36:01,158
Miss Blanche, I'll tell you right now,
if that sister of yours...

872
01:36:01,227 --> 01:36:04,196
has gone and given you sleeping pills
just to keep you quiet...

873
01:36:04,263 --> 01:36:06,390
while she's out doing I don't know what...

874
01:36:06,466 --> 01:36:09,731
I'm sure as hell
gonna call the police on her.

875
01:36:10,303 --> 01:36:11,998
It's all right, Miss Blanche.

876
01:36:25,818 --> 01:36:26,944
I'm glad I caught you.

877
01:36:27,019 --> 01:36:30,318
I hope you don't mind, there's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

878
01:36:30,390 --> 01:36:33,086
I'm kind of short of help around the house.

879
01:36:33,159 --> 01:36:35,889
I was wondering if you'd mind
my asking your cleaning lady...

880
01:36:35,962 --> 01:36:37,554
to give me a couple of days a week.

881
01:36:37,630 --> 01:36:40,463
As far as I'm concerned,
you can have her as often as you want.

882
01:36:40,533 --> 01:36:43,058
My sister and I are moving,
so we won't want her anymore.

883
01:36:43,136 --> 01:36:47,539
But you'll have to call her because
she isn't here. I've already sent her home.

884
01:36:47,607 --> 01:36:49,370
But I just saw her.

885
01:36:49,642 --> 01:36:51,701
Yes, but I sent her home.

886
01:36:51,844 --> 01:36:53,641
No, but that's impossible.

887
01:36:53,713 --> 01:36:56,614
I saw her go in the house
a few minutes ago.

888
01:37:01,687 --> 01:37:03,450
- In the house?
- Yes.

889
01:37:27,747 --> 01:37:30,511
So you finally decided to come back, huh?

890
01:37:31,050 --> 01:37:32,711
What're you doing here?

891
01:37:34,020 --> 01:37:36,386
- I told you, you were fired.
- Never mind all that.

892
01:37:36,456 --> 01:37:38,720
I want to know
what's going on around here.

893
01:37:38,791 --> 01:37:42,955
- But you said you didn't have your key.
- It just so happens that I did.

894
01:37:43,496 --> 01:37:47,626
So now you can tell me what you mean
by locking Miss Blanche in her room.

895
01:37:49,936 --> 01:37:52,370
This is my house and I can do what I like.

896
01:37:52,438 --> 01:37:54,429
It doesn't matter whose house it is.

897
01:37:54,507 --> 01:37:57,101
You've got to act like a grown woman,
like everybody else.

898
01:37:57,176 --> 01:38:00,168
Suppose there was a fire and
Miss Blanche was locked in her room?

899
01:38:00,246 --> 01:38:01,577
Well, there wasn't.

900
01:38:01,647 --> 01:38:04,741
You open that door
and stop all this nonsense!

901
01:38:05,117 --> 01:38:07,108
- Then give me the key.
- No.

902
01:38:07,753 --> 01:38:10,119
She's asleep. I gave her a pill.

903
01:38:10,456 --> 01:38:11,684
You did?

904
01:38:11,824 --> 01:38:15,123
Then you better give me that key
and be quick about it.

905
01:38:15,194 --> 01:38:17,822
I won't, and you can't make me.

906
01:38:18,064 --> 01:38:19,656
I'm not afraid of you.

907
01:38:19,732 --> 01:38:23,133
All right, Miss Hudson.
I'm not going to fool with you.

908
01:38:23,503 --> 01:38:27,530
If you won't give me that key,
I'll go right down and call the police.

909
01:38:29,208 --> 01:38:30,903
You'll be sorry.

910
01:38:31,244 --> 01:38:32,734
Give me that key.

911
01:38:45,691 --> 01:38:47,318
I didn't mean her any harm.

912
01:38:47,393 --> 01:38:49,759
You better not have done her any harm.

913
01:38:56,302 --> 01:38:58,293
My God, Miss Blanche.

914
01:38:58,571 --> 01:39:00,471
What has she done to you?

915
01:39:08,681 --> 01:39:10,774
I'll get it off in a minute.

916
01:39:10,850 --> 01:39:14,377
Don't worry, Miss Blanche.
I'll get you down from here.

917
01:39:17,123 --> 01:39:18,647
You just rest easy.

918
01:39:35,174 --> 01:39:37,574
Going out, are you, dear?

919
01:39:39,645 --> 01:39:42,705
- You know I am.
- Having dinner with her?

920
01:39:44,684 --> 01:39:46,151
I'm forgotten.

921
01:39:47,086 --> 01:39:50,613
You won't be back too late,
will you, lovey?

922
01:39:57,930 --> 01:39:59,557
Who knows?

923
01:40:16,649 --> 01:40:19,812
You could've been better than all of them.

924
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:23,054
But they didn't want that.

925
01:40:32,264 --> 01:40:34,664
They just didn't love you enough.

926
01:40:36,335 --> 01:40:39,429
You know that?
They just didn't love you enough.

927
01:41:35,428 --> 01:41:36,793
Miss Hudson?

928
01:41:39,331 --> 01:41:41,424
I'm sorry, Edwin.

929
01:41:42,101 --> 01:41:44,535
I can't let you in.

930
01:41:45,237 --> 01:41:46,602
Not now.

931
01:42:02,254 --> 01:42:03,915
To hell with it!

932
01:42:14,934 --> 01:42:17,129
I can't let you in.

933
01:42:23,509 --> 01:42:24,874
Not now.

934
01:42:44,964 --> 01:42:48,866
What am I going to do?

935
01:45:10,943 --> 01:45:15,403
Miss Hudson, I thought...
I didn't know there was anyone in here.

936
01:45:15,481 --> 01:45:17,449
I just came home and saw a light...

937
01:45:17,516 --> 01:45:20,314
and I thought perhaps
you'd left the lights of your car on.

938
01:45:20,386 --> 01:45:23,787
- I've had that happen to me.
- That's all right, Mrs. Bates.

939
01:45:23,889 --> 01:45:26,790
I had that happen to me once, it's no joke.

940
01:45:27,526 --> 01:45:30,962
You wake up in the morning
and find you've got a dead battery.

941
01:45:31,263 --> 01:45:32,457
No joke.

942
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:37,992
Well, as long as everything's all right...

943
01:45:38,470 --> 01:45:41,132
- I guess I'll just say good night.
- Good night.

944
01:47:34,053 --> 01:47:36,078
That doesn't prove anything.

945
01:47:36,155 --> 01:47:39,886
- Now what do you think you'll do?
- I'll manage, lovey.

946
01:47:39,958 --> 01:47:41,926
I suppose you think I'm making all this up.

947
01:47:41,994 --> 01:47:44,690
- I wouldn't know.
- Hazel should know, shouldn't she?

948
01:47:44,763 --> 01:47:47,561
She worked in the same studio
and that's when it all happened.

949
01:47:47,633 --> 01:47:50,158
Just after one of those studio parties...

950
01:47:50,235 --> 01:47:52,135
and right in front of her own house.

951
01:47:52,204 --> 01:47:56,072
Jane Hudson drove a car straight
at her own sister and crippled her for life.

952
01:47:56,141 --> 01:47:58,132
Come on, you mean she tried to kill her?

953
01:47:58,210 --> 01:48:01,202
Yes, she did.
She tried to murder her own sister.

954
01:48:01,447 --> 01:48:03,472
How is it they didn't arrest her then?

955
01:48:03,549 --> 01:48:06,143
They would've,
but the studio had it all hushed up...

956
01:48:06,218 --> 01:48:08,277
on account of Blanche Hudson's career.

957
01:48:08,353 --> 01:48:10,014
That sounds very likely.

958
01:48:10,089 --> 01:48:13,320
Yes, doesn't it? So the fine woman
you've chosen to run around with...

959
01:48:13,392 --> 01:48:16,384
turns out to be broke
and a murderer, as well.

960
01:48:16,462 --> 01:48:18,089
- I see!
- Well, it's true!

961
01:48:18,163 --> 01:48:21,223
All right then,
I'll ask her about it when I see her again.

962
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:23,666
You wouldn't see a woman like that again?

963
01:48:23,735 --> 01:48:26,033
Why not? You just told me
she's got a rich sister.

964
01:48:26,105 --> 01:48:28,596
But you haven't heard the worst of it yet.

965
01:48:28,674 --> 01:48:31,006
- You mean there's more?
- Yes, there is.

966
01:48:31,076 --> 01:48:34,876
After she'd run down her own sister,
your precious Jane Hudson...

967
01:48:34,947 --> 01:48:38,747
ran off and left her there to die,
like some poor animal.

968
01:48:38,884 --> 01:48:42,285
She ran off and disappeared
for three whole days.

969
01:48:42,354 --> 01:48:45,050
What happened then?
Don't tell me they couldn't find her.

970
01:48:45,124 --> 01:48:48,116
They found her, all right.

971
01:48:48,193 --> 01:48:50,354
They found her in some hotel room...

972
01:48:50,429 --> 01:48:53,227
with a man that
she'd never even seen before.

973
01:48:53,298 --> 01:48:55,664
Why should that upset you?

974
01:48:57,469 --> 01:48:59,835
Isn't that how I was conceived?

975
01:49:25,330 --> 01:49:27,389
Yes, this is Miss Hudson.

976
01:49:43,649 --> 01:49:45,048
She left.

977
01:49:48,687 --> 01:49:50,177
About a week ago.

978
01:49:51,590 --> 01:49:55,856
We have a report here filed by her cousin,
listing her as a missing person.

979
01:49:56,161 --> 01:49:59,062
Did she tell you what her plans were,
anything like that?

980
01:50:01,433 --> 01:50:03,628
No, I don't know a thing.

981
01:50:03,902 --> 01:50:07,394
We have some other addresses to check.
Maybe we'll come up with something.

982
01:50:07,472 --> 01:50:10,441
Otherwise we'll probably be
getting in touch with you again.

983
01:50:10,509 --> 01:50:14,138
Meanwhile, if you do hear from her,
we would appreciate you letting us know.

984
01:50:43,675 --> 01:50:46,439
The police are looking for Elvira.

985
01:50:47,145 --> 01:50:49,238
It wasn't my fault. She wouldn't go away.

986
01:50:49,314 --> 01:50:51,680
You heard her,
she wouldn't leave me alone.

987
01:50:51,750 --> 01:50:55,413
I don't know what to do, Blanche.
What am I going to do?

988
01:51:00,792 --> 01:51:02,783
What am I going to do?

989
01:51:06,064 --> 01:51:08,555
If they find her, we'll have to run away.

990
01:51:08,634 --> 01:51:11,831
That's what we'll do. We'll just go away.

991
01:51:13,372 --> 01:51:15,897
But then I wouldn't see Edwin anymore.

992
01:51:16,308 --> 01:51:18,572
He wouldn't like what I did.

993
01:51:19,111 --> 01:51:22,638
It wasn't my fault,
but he wouldn't like what I did.

994
01:51:24,016 --> 01:51:26,678
I don't care. We'll just go to the beach.

995
01:51:26,752 --> 01:51:29,812
We'll go and live at the seashore
all the time, like we used to...

996
01:51:29,888 --> 01:51:32,254
when I was little and Daddy was there.

997
01:51:32,324 --> 01:51:34,758
And maybe we'll have friends.

998
01:51:34,993 --> 01:51:38,258
People would come and see us.
I'd like that.

999
01:51:47,639 --> 01:51:49,732
Blanche, listen to me.

1000
01:51:51,009 --> 01:51:54,342
You know I always wanted
everything to be nice, don't you?

1001
01:51:54,413 --> 01:51:57,541
I don't see how Elvira
could make me do a thing like that.

1002
01:51:57,616 --> 01:51:59,641
I just don't understand.

1003
01:52:00,085 --> 01:52:02,645
It was like that time in the hotel room...

1004
01:52:02,721 --> 01:52:06,680
when they came and told me
that you were hurt and that I'd done it.

1005
01:52:06,758 --> 01:52:10,159
And there was a big man there,
a policeman.

1006
01:52:10,329 --> 01:52:12,490
And he hit me and he slapped me and...

1007
01:52:12,564 --> 01:52:16,330
I tried to tell him that
I couldn't do a thing like that.

1008
01:52:16,401 --> 01:52:18,801
Not to my own sister.

1009
01:52:25,510 --> 01:52:27,375
He said I was a liar.

1010
01:52:29,014 --> 01:52:30,811
The accident, it...

1011
01:52:31,883 --> 01:52:34,181
No, it wasn't an accident.

1012
01:52:34,252 --> 01:52:37,312
I did it. You told me so yourself.

1013
01:52:41,526 --> 01:52:43,926
I must tell you.

1014
01:52:43,995 --> 01:52:46,156
I don't want to talk about it!

1015
01:52:46,398 --> 01:52:49,959
Every time I think about something nice,
you remind me of the bad things.

1016
01:52:50,035 --> 01:52:52,765
I only want to talk about the nice things.

1017
01:52:58,176 --> 01:53:01,771
Remember when Daddy and I
used to rehearse at the beach?

1018
01:53:03,014 --> 01:53:05,380
I'd be dancing on the sand...

1019
01:53:06,218 --> 01:53:08,948
and all the people
would come and watch...

1020
01:53:09,388 --> 01:53:12,551
all crowd around
to see Baby Jane Hudson.

1021
01:53:23,235 --> 01:53:24,634
What'll I do?

1022
01:53:25,637 --> 01:53:28,197
- Let them in.
- But what if...

1023
01:53:29,341 --> 01:53:31,969
It may be Edwin.

1024
01:53:34,479 --> 01:53:37,209
Of course. It's Edwin.

1025
01:53:47,359 --> 01:53:49,418
You want to make him tell on me.

1026
01:53:51,096 --> 01:53:52,495
No, Jane.

1027
01:53:57,102 --> 01:53:58,091
Please.

1028
01:54:15,854 --> 01:54:17,481
Wait for me.

1029
01:54:27,199 --> 01:54:28,188
Yes.

1030
01:54:28,433 --> 01:54:32,199
I'm sorry, but we just picked up
this young man in front of your house.

1031
01:54:32,270 --> 01:54:35,364
Says he's on his way in to see you.
Is that right?

1032
01:54:36,641 --> 01:54:40,008
- I don't understand.
- They're trying to say I'm drunk.

1033
01:54:40,078 --> 01:54:42,876
We'll just say that
you're a little happy, okay?

1034
01:54:42,948 --> 01:54:44,643
Who's happy?

1035
01:54:45,150 --> 01:54:46,617
I'm not happy.

1036
01:54:53,925 --> 01:54:55,449
So now you know.

1037
01:54:55,794 --> 01:54:58,194
That's right. So now we know.

1038
01:54:59,397 --> 01:55:02,560
Sorry to have bothered you, Miss Hudson.
Good night.

1039
01:55:26,424 --> 01:55:30,190
I have the money. Really, I have.
But don't be mean to me.

1040
01:55:31,329 --> 01:55:35,288
- You promised me.
- I know I did, and I have the money.

1041
01:55:36,101 --> 01:55:39,434
Look, let's go in the kitchen
and have a drink together.

1042
01:55:39,504 --> 01:55:43,668
It's nice there.
And then we can be friends again...

1043
01:55:44,042 --> 01:55:45,509
and everything.

1044
01:55:46,211 --> 01:55:48,736
- I've got something else for you, too.
- What?

1045
01:55:48,813 --> 01:55:51,782
It's a surprise. Would you like to have...

1046
01:55:59,090 --> 01:56:01,217
You're gonna like your present.

1047
01:56:02,694 --> 01:56:04,753
You're really gonna like it.

1048
01:56:05,664 --> 01:56:07,393
Drink your drink, Edwin.

1049
01:56:09,267 --> 01:56:11,633
I'll go get it for you.

1050
01:56:44,202 --> 01:56:46,193
This is my very own.

1051
01:56:47,606 --> 01:56:49,972
It's a genuine Baby Jane Doll.

1052
01:56:52,043 --> 01:56:55,137
I used to give them
to all my really good friends...

1053
01:56:55,213 --> 01:56:57,511
the people that I worked with.

1054
01:56:58,016 --> 01:57:00,484
- They made them for me.
- Marvelous.

1055
01:57:00,552 --> 01:57:03,749
- Specially.
- Very lifelike.

1056
01:57:03,822 --> 01:57:06,950
Now, Jane, you talk to nice Mr. Flagg...

1057
01:57:07,592 --> 01:57:11,653
and nice Mr. Flagg will have his money
in a minute.

1058
01:57:25,610 --> 01:57:27,942
You're not comfy like that, are you?

1059
01:57:46,531 --> 01:57:48,021
Let's go bye-bye.

1060
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:04,110
Here comes the Super Chief.

1061
01:58:11,122 --> 01:58:12,453
Stop it!

1062
01:58:16,861 --> 01:58:18,453
What was that?

1063
01:58:18,596 --> 01:58:21,531
Nothing. I didn't do anything.

1064
01:58:27,839 --> 01:58:30,034
She'll take you away from me.

1065
01:58:41,019 --> 01:58:42,543
Please...

1066
01:58:43,521 --> 01:58:44,715
help me.

1067
01:59:00,338 --> 01:59:02,067
She's dying.

1068
01:59:04,275 --> 01:59:06,800
For God's sake.

1069
01:59:08,980 --> 01:59:10,413
She's dying.

1070
01:59:10,715 --> 01:59:12,478
Get away from me!

1071
01:59:15,386 --> 01:59:18,150
Edwin, I've got your money.

1072
01:59:19,457 --> 01:59:22,221
Edwin, you forgot your money!

1073
01:59:32,570 --> 01:59:34,470
He hates me.

1074
01:59:50,555 --> 01:59:51,852
Stop.

1075
02:00:06,838 --> 02:00:08,635
He's going to tell.

1076
02:00:32,630 --> 02:00:35,190
You've got to help me.

1077
02:00:35,633 --> 02:00:37,567
We've got to leave.

1078
02:00:40,939 --> 02:00:43,567
Please, Blanche.

1079
02:00:45,176 --> 02:00:47,201
Help me.

1080
02:03:13,891 --> 02:03:16,018
I like this place.

1081
02:03:16,394 --> 02:03:18,954
We can just sit here for a while.

1082
02:03:19,163 --> 02:03:23,031
And pretty soon the sun will come up
and it will be nice.

1083
02:03:24,902 --> 02:03:27,132
You should look at the sea.

1084
02:03:27,505 --> 02:03:29,973
It has all lights on it.

1085
02:03:30,908 --> 02:03:32,637
You used to like that.

1086
02:04:01,339 --> 02:04:04,274
<i>We interrupt this program</i>
<i>to bring you a special news bulletin.</i>

1087
02:04:04,342 --> 02:04:07,209
<i>At 11... 25 this morning,</i>
<i>all local law-enforcement agencies...</i>

1088
02:04:07,278 --> 02:04:08,643
<i>had assigned Special Details...</i>

1089
02:04:08,713 --> 02:04:12,649
<i>to the kidnap-slaying mystery</i>
<i>that surrounds the famed Hudson sisters.</i>

1090
02:04:12,717 --> 02:04:15,811
<i>It is believed that Blanche Hudson,</i>
<i>film great of the early '30s...</i>

1091
02:04:15,887 --> 02:04:19,983
<i>has been forcibly abducted by her sister,</i>
<i>former child star, Baby Jane Hudson...</i>

1092
02:04:20,058 --> 02:04:22,856
<i>from the family home</i>
<i>on North McCadden in Hollywood...</i>

1093
02:04:22,927 --> 02:04:26,829
<i>sometime between the hours of</i>
<i>10... 00 p.m. And 10... 30 p.m. Last evening.</i>

1094
02:04:26,931 --> 02:04:28,694
<i>With the exception of one witness...</i>

1095
02:04:28,766 --> 02:04:32,793
<i>who reportedly saw the Hudson car,</i>
<i>a 1940 or 1941 black convertible...</i>

1096
02:04:32,870 --> 02:04:34,997
<i>heading west on Wilshire</i>
<i>and Santa Monica...</i>

1097
02:04:35,073 --> 02:04:38,509
<i>no report has been received to date</i>
<i>concerning the missing sisters.</i>

1098
02:05:07,004 --> 02:05:10,440
- So you found that colored woman.
- They found her, all right.

1099
02:05:10,708 --> 02:05:13,905
Sure is a rotten way
to get your picture in the papers.

1100
02:05:13,978 --> 02:05:17,038
You reckon you'll find that Baby Jane,
or whatever her name is?

1101
02:05:17,115 --> 02:05:20,175
Sure, we'll find her.
But I guess maybe it'll be too late.

1102
02:05:56,821 --> 02:06:00,450
Officer, there's a car down there
parked right out in the road.

1103
02:06:00,525 --> 02:06:03,323
I almost got stuck in the sand
when I tried to get around it.

1104
02:06:03,394 --> 02:06:06,124
- You mean that old Lincoln convertible?
- That's right.

1105
02:06:06,197 --> 02:06:09,428
That was parked there
when we opened up this morning.

1106
02:06:09,834 --> 02:06:13,793
The keys are there, but I didn't
want to move it. I thought maybe...

1107
02:06:14,105 --> 02:06:15,732
What do you figure?

1108
02:06:15,806 --> 02:06:18,206
Cops. How do you figure cops?

1109
02:06:32,490 --> 02:06:33,286
This is it.

1110
02:07:05,823 --> 02:07:07,313
You must be hot.

1111
02:07:15,600 --> 02:07:17,067
Help me.

1112
02:07:18,803 --> 02:07:20,464
I'm afraid.

1113
02:07:25,443 --> 02:07:27,434
Find someone...

1114
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:31,612
- a doctor.
- I can't.

1115
02:07:34,418 --> 02:07:35,885
If I die...

1116
02:07:38,689 --> 02:07:39,986
you'll be alone.

1117
02:07:40,057 --> 02:07:43,117
But they'll be mean to me,
like they were before.

1118
02:07:43,661 --> 02:07:45,322
They'll be kind.

1119
02:07:47,798 --> 02:07:49,663
I don't want to hear.

1120
02:07:51,269 --> 02:07:52,827
Jane, I'm dying.

1121
02:07:54,338 --> 02:07:56,067
There's no time.

1122
02:07:57,308 --> 02:07:59,071
You must listen.

1123
02:08:00,111 --> 02:08:01,669
I made you...

1124
02:08:02,146 --> 02:08:04,307
waste your whole life...

1125
02:08:05,683 --> 02:08:07,844
thinking you'd crippled me.

1126
02:08:08,119 --> 02:08:09,746
Please stop.

1127
02:08:11,989 --> 02:08:14,253
You didn't do it, Jane.

1128
02:08:16,894 --> 02:08:19,328
I did it myself.

1129
02:08:21,365 --> 02:08:23,265
Don't you understand?

1130
02:08:24,902 --> 02:08:27,462
I crippled myself.

1131
02:08:29,240 --> 02:08:32,038
You weren't driving that night.

1132
02:08:59,804 --> 02:09:02,136
You weren't driving.

1133
02:09:03,607 --> 02:09:07,737
You were too drunk.
I wouldn't let you drive.

1134
02:09:10,114 --> 02:09:12,344
I made you go open the gates.

1135
02:09:13,317 --> 02:09:15,649
I watched you get out of the car.

1136
02:09:17,521 --> 02:09:20,490
You'd been so cruel to me at the party.

1137
02:09:21,559 --> 02:09:23,151
Imitating me...

1138
02:09:23,761 --> 02:09:26,025
making people laugh at me.

1139
02:09:27,098 --> 02:09:29,464
I watched you get out of the car.

1140
02:09:31,068 --> 02:09:33,332
I wanted to run you down...

1141
02:09:34,038 --> 02:09:35,699
crush you.

1142
02:09:36,540 --> 02:09:38,940
But you saw the car coming.

1143
02:09:41,178 --> 02:09:43,271
I hit the gates.

1144
02:09:48,452 --> 02:09:50,443
Snapped my spine.

1145
02:09:52,723 --> 02:09:54,520
Then, you mean...

1146
02:09:57,661 --> 02:10:01,028
all this time we could've been friends?

1147
02:10:03,167 --> 02:10:06,728
You were frightened and ran away.

1148
02:10:09,173 --> 02:10:12,404
I managed to crawl out of the car
and up to the gates.

1149
02:10:13,744 --> 02:10:15,735
When they found me...

1150
02:10:16,447 --> 02:10:18,938
they assumed it was your fault.

1151
02:10:21,786 --> 02:10:24,914
You were so drunk and confused.

1152
02:10:25,790 --> 02:10:27,485
You didn't know any better.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
