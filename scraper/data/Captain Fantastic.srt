1
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:31,309
Today, the boy is dead.

2
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:33,322
And in his place

3
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:41,616
is a man.

4
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,059
Here you go.

5
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:50,941
Training in 60 minutes.

6
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:20,478
Where's the boning knife?

7
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:22,526
Dad?

8
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:25,994
Zaja took
the boning knife again.

9
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:39,174
Oh, yeah.

10
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:46,184
Oh, Jesus.

11
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:50,929
Pol Pot.

12
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,180
Yeah.

13
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:55,141
Boning knife.

14
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:58,266
Mountain beaver, huh?

15
00:07:58,688 --> 00:07:59,858
Mmm-hmm.

16
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You're dead.

17
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,709
Vespyr, Kielyr, pair off.

18
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:26,755
Get your guard up.

19
00:08:27,383 --> 00:08:28,723
You have to stab to kill.

20
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:32,143
Aim for the liver or the kidneys,
otherwise she'll never learn.

21
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:33,261
Shouldn't we aim here?

22
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,347
A knife in the lungs
creates a pneumothorax.

23
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,190
Or next to the sternum,
to penetrate the heart?

24
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:39,904
That'd be instant death.

25
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:42,771
If it makes you happy, Zaj, sure.
Aim for the heart.

26
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,859
Bo, you want to show 'em?
Over here.

27
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:46,936
Okay, let's go.

28
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:48,953
Disarm her if you can.

29
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,906
Ow!

30
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:57,155
Good.

31
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:59,333
How is that good?
She just stabbed me.

32
00:08:59,457 --> 00:09:01,457
She fucking just stabbed me.

33
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,042
Well, then learn
to defend yourself.

34
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:05,397
You kill her.
Yeah, thank you.

35
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:06,551
Let's try that.

36
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,093
Zaj, page.

37
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,749
Three hundred
and ninety-eight.

38
00:09:47,255 --> 00:09:49,625
You still liking it?
Mmm-hmm.

39
00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:51,434
To stay on schedule
for the test,

40
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:54,299
you're going to have to be
finished in eight days. Okay?

41
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,262
Okay.

42
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,982
Vesp? How you getting along?

43
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:04,653
I just finished Chapter 12,

44
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,272
"The World on a String."

45
00:10:08,818 --> 00:10:10,318
What?

46
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:13,445
Are you having any trouble
with quantum entanglement?

47
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:16,328
Planck length
versus Planck time?

48
00:10:18,286 --> 00:10:19,996
I'm fine.
Good.

49
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:21,371
Then tomorrow after lunch,

50
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,415
you can give a brief
presentation on M-theory.

51
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:27,001
Argue counterpoints with Bo and
Rell vis-à-vis Witten and Dirac.

52
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,147
Whoo!

53
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:09,582
Go. Go all the way
to the top.

54
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:20,110
If training is over today, can
we take Steve somewhere for class later?

55
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:21,184
Maybe.

56
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,850
Why does Mommy have
to be gone so long?

57
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:27,784
She hasn't been
gone very long.

58
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,348
Actually,
it's been three months,

59
00:13:29,435 --> 00:13:32,345
two weeks, six days,
and 11 hours.

60
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:33,478
Mom is very ill.

61
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:35,125
Don't talk to us like
we're your inferiors.

62
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:37,899
Bo is right. Mom needs to
be in the hospital right now.

63
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,963
But you said hospitals are
only a great place to go

64
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:41,590
if you're a healthy person
and you want to die.

65
00:13:41,614 --> 00:13:44,914
You said Americans are
undereducated and over medicated.

66
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,162
You said the AMA
are avaricious whores

67
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:49,473
only too willing to spread
their fat legs for Big Pharma.

68
00:13:49,497 --> 00:13:51,417
All of those things
are true.

69
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:54,709
But Mom does not have enough of
the neurotransmitter serotonin

70
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,883
to conduct electrical
signals in her brain.

71
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:59,552
Exactly when is
Mom coming back?

72
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:03,053
That's what I'm
going to go find out.

73
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:05,675
Be good, monkey butts.

74
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:06,763
See you later, Dad.

75
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,307
Bye.
Bye, guys.

76
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:54,936
Sorry.

77
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:58,944
Are you coming in?

78
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,323
No? Okay. Bye.

79
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:13,834
Here, Bo, I got that.
Go talk to them.

80
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:15,456
We got time.

81
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,894
Ask her what she thinks
of the working people

82
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,298
creating an armed revolution
against the exploiting classes

83
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:21,709
and their state structures?

84
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:24,467
Well, Marxists can be just
as genocidal as capitalists.

85
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,444
Or whether or not she's a
dialectical materialist

86
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,138
and accords primacy
to the class struggle?

87
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,390
Avoid Marxism.

88
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,313
Or telling her
you're a Trotskyite.

89
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,890
Trotskyist.

90
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:35,685
Only a Stalinist would call
a Trotskyist a Trotskyite.

91
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,149
And I'm not
a Trotskyist anymore.

92
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,400
I'm a Maoist.

93
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:41,858
Right.

94
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:45,404
I forgot, sorry.

95
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,990
Hey.

96
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:51,035
Hey, Joe.

97
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:53,077
I sold all your
stuff from last time.

98
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:54,412
Great.
Let's see what you got.

99
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:40,003
<i>Hello?</i>
Hey.

100
00:16:40,084 --> 00:16:41,884
<i>Ben.</i>
How's she doing?

101
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,180
Harper?

102
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:54,809
Harper?

103
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,231
<i>Leslie killed
herself last night.</i>

104
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:05,608
How?

105
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:09,033
Harper.

106
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:12,028
Harper, tell me.

107
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,123
<i>She slit her wrists.</i>

108
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:24,711
<i>You're my brother.
If you need anything from me...</i>

109
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:22,937
Last night,

110
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,320
Mommy killed herself.

111
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:30,324
She finally did it.

112
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,575
Your mother is dead.

113
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:49,843
Nothing is going to change.

114
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:55,511
We will go on living
in exactly the same way.

115
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,055
We're a family.

116
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:01,933
No.

117
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,017
Mom!

118
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:26,075
Mom! Mom!

119
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,035
Fuck you! Fucking...

120
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,210
Mom! Mom!

121
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,223
I hate you!

122
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:35,589
Fuck!

123
00:19:58,782 --> 00:19:59,992
Daddy.

124
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:37,278
Jesus fucking Christ.

125
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:12,019
<i>- Forty-three.
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!</i>

126
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:13,317
<i>Forty-four.</i>

127
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:15,356
Forty-five.

128
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:19,445
Hold plank.

129
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,160
Like boards.

130
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:25,661
Breathe, breathe,
breathe, breathe.

131
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:27,254
You got it.

132
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:30,544
Keep holding.

133
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,246
You're strong, you can do it.

134
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:36,628
Dad, when's Mom's funeral?

135
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:41,551
<i>The utter recklessness,</i>

136
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:45,055
<i>the instability and insecurity that
you have brought to her life...</i>

137
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,678
We decided to live here.
Both of us.

138
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:49,596
<i>This is your fault.</i>

139
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:52,853
Leslie had a disease.

140
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:54,123
She had to be in
a good facility.

141
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:55,827
You were kind enough
to offer to pay for it

142
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:57,571
as long as she was
treated near you.

143
00:21:57,651 --> 00:21:58,691
We did that.

144
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:00,567
I found her will.

145
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:03,414
I assume you know
that Leslie was a Buddhist.

146
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:06,989
That means she wanted to be
cremated, not buried.

147
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:08,869
It was very
important to her...

148
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:10,794
<i>I have just
lost my only child.</i>

149
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:14,422
<i>I'm in no mood to discuss the
particulars of her funeral with you.</i>

150
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,551
<i>Wherever you are, stay there!</i>

151
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:18,168
<i>You are not welcome here.</i>

152
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:20,165
<i>If you show up,
I will have you arrested.</i>

153
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:25,511
Jack? God damn it.

154
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:27,175
<i>Hello, Ben.</i>

155
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:30,726
<i>Leslie is in Heaven now.
She is finally at peace.</i>

156
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:33,351
When is the ceremony?

157
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:37,734
<i>It's in five days,
in New Mexico, at our church.</i>

158
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,320
<i>How are the children?</i>

159
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:40,941
Did you hear
what Jack just said?

160
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:42,278
<i>It's been years.</i>

161
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:45,702
He said that he would have
me arrested if we go there.

162
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:47,278
Did you hear that?

163
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:48,907
<i>He's very upset.</i>

164
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:52,995
<i>It's just best to
do what he says.</i>

165
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:02,046
It doesn't make any sense.

166
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,930
I mean, who are they
to make these decisions?

167
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:07,389
It's this sick sense of entitlement
that they all seem to have.

168
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:09,615
This is what we stand against,
this is what Mom stood against.

169
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:10,849
Mom hated that world.

170
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:13,022
Clothes on when
we eat, please.

171
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:20,877
It's completely unjust,
that's what it is.

172
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:23,781
We're in the very unique
position of hating those people.

173
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:26,112
- Can "unique" be modified?
- No.

174
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:30,408
We don't hate
Nana and Grandpa,

175
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:33,956
but the rest of their tribe
are fascist capitalists.

176
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:35,917
You're just repeating
whatever Dad says.

177
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:40,089
I'm writing down everything you say.
In my mind.

178
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:43,553
Do you even know
what a fascist is?

179
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:46,012
Violent, nationalist militants.

180
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:50,143
Supported by big business and their
totalitarian single-party dictators.

181
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:56,058
We're her family, we have to go.
Grandpa said we can't.

182
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:01,066
What will happen
if they arrest you?

183
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,155
Will they take
us away from you?

184
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,370
That's a possibility.

185
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:32,012
<i>Hey.</i>

186
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:35,227
Wake up.

187
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:42,571
Wake up, grizzly bear,
my fantastic man.

188
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:57,081
What we're doing out
here is so incredible.

189
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,460
The kids are amazing.

190
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:08,132
But you have to take care
of them for me, okay?

191
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:14,644
I love you all so much.

192
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:19,604
I love you so much.

193
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:46,496
We want to see Mom.

194
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:48,168
Plus, Grandpa can't
oppress us.

195
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:50,472
We want
to honor her life.

196
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,047
It's the least
you could do.

197
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,970
What's that
supposed to mean?

198
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:57,971
You know.

199
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:01,016
No, I don't.

200
00:26:02,646 --> 00:26:05,226
Forget it. But I know.

201
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:07,817
We're strong and we're ready.
I said no.

202
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:10,197
Too risky.

203
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:11,998
We're defined by our actions,
not our words.

204
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,810
Dad,
give us the mission.

205
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:15,615
Mission: Rescue Mom!

206
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:18,037
Training in
10 minutes.

207
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:47,896
Oh, fuck!

208
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:50,364
Rell?

209
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:52,404
Can you flex
your fingers?

210
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:55,822
S-T-O-P.

211
00:26:56,199 --> 00:27:00,909
Stay calm. Think.
Observe. And plan.

212
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:04,579
If you hit the rocks below you,
you'll die from blunt force trauma.

213
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:08,249
Or internal bleeding from
massive bone fracturing.

214
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:12,011
Or splenic flexure
of the large intestine.

215
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,010
Yes, thank you, Zaj.

216
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,760
I can't, my hand.

217
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:18,345
There's no cavalry.

218
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:22,597
No one will magically appear
and save you in the end.

219
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:35,606
Almost.

220
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:40,286
You got it.
Good boy.

221
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:43,036
All right, let's go.

222
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:28,921
Class time on Steve.
We're going up to the glacier.

223
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:31,168
Let's go.

224
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,830
We can't go to
Mommy's funeral.

225
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:12,631
We have to do
what we're told.

226
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:17,085
Some fights,
you can't win.

227
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:20,636
The powerful control the
lives of the powerless.

228
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:24,102
That's the way
the world works.

229
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,846
It's unjust and it's unfair.

230
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:29,772
But that's just
too damn bad.

231
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:34,317
We have to shut up
and accept it.

232
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:47,501
Well, fuck that.

233
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:58,009
So they know we're coming!

234
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,180
Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

235
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:55,557
<i>Attention all campers,
this is your captain speaking.</i>

236
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:58,778
<i>Here we have the embodiment
of Calvin Coolidge's statement</i>

237
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,360
<i>that the business of
America is business.</i>

238
00:31:01,444 --> 00:31:03,744
<i>Our democracy is one of
the brightest lights</i>

239
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:07,241
<i>of social justice
in the history of humankind.</i>

240
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:11,747
<i>And yet most of our fellow citizens
engage in frenzied shopping</i>

241
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:14,121
<i>as their primary form
of social interaction.</i>

242
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:16,879
<i>"Come on down, let's go shopping!"</i>

243
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:18,795
<i>"These prices are insane!"</i>

244
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,940
- What's a bordello? Oh.
- A whorehouse.

245
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:42,572
What are you reading?

246
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:47,122
<i>Lolita?</i>
I didn't assign that book.

247
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:48,947
I'm skipping ahead.

248
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:51,791
And?

249
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:55,432
- It's interesting.
- "Interesting!"

250
00:31:55,456 --> 00:31:56,456
Illegal word!

251
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:58,633
Dad, Kielyr
said "interesting!"

252
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:00,211
"Interesting"
is a non-word.

253
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:01,735
You know you're supposed
to avoid it.

254
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:03,053
Be specific.

255
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:05,631
It's disturbing.
More specific.

256
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:07,047
Can I just read?

257
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:09,465
After you give us
your analysis thus far.

258
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:13,314
There's this old man
who loves this girl,

259
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:16,481
and she's only 12 years old.
That's the plot.

260
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:27,659
Because it's written
from his perspective,

261
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,160
you sort of understand
and sympathize with him.

262
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:33,662
Which is kind of amazing

263
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:37,166
because he's essentially
a child molester.

264
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:40,960
But his love for her
is beautiful.

265
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:46,423
But it's also sort of a trick
because it's so wrong.

266
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:51,137
You know, he's old,
and he basically rapes her.

267
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,639
So it makes me feel...

268
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,650
I hate him.

269
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:02,687
And somehow I feel sorry
for him at the same time.

270
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:05,822
Well done.

271
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:10,028
What does "rape" mean?

272
00:33:13,618 --> 00:33:15,618
When a person, usually a man,

273
00:33:15,703 --> 00:33:18,043
forces another person,
usually a woman,

274
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:20,174
to have sexual intercourse.

275
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:21,379
Oh.

276
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:23,799
- Who's hungry?
- Me!

277
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:27,972
What's "sexual intercourse"?

278
00:33:29,884 --> 00:33:33,554
When a man sticks his penis
in a woman's vagina.

279
00:33:34,222 --> 00:33:36,472
Everyone keep their
eyes peeled for deer.

280
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:40,557
Why would a man stick his
penis in a woman's vagina?

281
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:45,321
Because it can give
them both pleasure.

282
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,570
And because the combination
of a man's sperm

283
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:49,652
and a woman's egg
can create a baby

284
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:51,567
and continue the human race.

285
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:54,236
But that's where she pees.

286
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:58,156
Pee comes not from the vagina,
but from the urethra,

287
00:33:58,246 --> 00:34:00,666
which is within
the outer labia.

288
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:04,248
But generally speaking, yes,
that is where she pees.

289
00:34:05,503 --> 00:34:08,093
Everyone keep your eyes open
for game of any kind.

290
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:43,618
Okay.

291
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:48,798
Now what?

292
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,630
What's wrong with everyone?

293
00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:52,222
Are they sick?

294
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,550
What do you mean?
Everyone's so fat.

295
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:58,929
Yeah, they are.
Fat like hippos.

296
00:34:59,307 --> 00:35:01,307
That's not nice to say.
But look!

297
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:08,152
Okay, you can think that,
but we don't make fun of people.

298
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:09,899
- Right, Dad?
- That's right.

299
00:35:09,984 --> 00:35:11,744
We don't make fun
of people.

300
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:13,069
Except Christians.

301
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:29,214
Dad? Dad?

302
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:33,839
Shit.

303
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:47,690
This, right now,
this is your first real test.

304
00:35:48,356 --> 00:35:51,476
Stay calm,
remember your training.

305
00:35:55,488 --> 00:35:56,948
Morning.
How you doing today?

306
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:58,201
Morning, Officer.

307
00:35:58,282 --> 00:36:00,202
Can I see your license
and registration, please?

308
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:01,866
Certainly.

309
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:06,287
Nice rig.
Thank you.

310
00:36:06,374 --> 00:36:08,714
I pulled you over because your
back left taillight is out.

311
00:36:08,835 --> 00:36:09,835
Did you know that?

312
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:12,381
No, I didn't.
I'm sorry.

313
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:14,467
I'll be right back.

314
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:21,179
No school today?

315
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:24,519
Not yet.

316
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,910
Man, by his sin, has
become separated from God.

317
00:36:42,994 --> 00:36:44,914
And only through personally
accepting the gift

318
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:47,827
of reconciliation purchased
by Jesus on the cross

319
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:50,495
can he regain his
fellowship with God.

320
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:52,835
We're home-schooled.
Father, may I?

321
00:36:54,589 --> 00:36:56,009
You may.

322
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:59,933
<i>One day when Heaven
was filled with his praises</i>

323
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:03,934
<i>One day when
sin was as black as could be</i>

324
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:09,019
<i>Jesus came forth
to be born of a virgin</i>

325
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:13,270
<i>Dwelt among men,
my example is He</i>

326
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:17,284
<i>Living, He loved me
Dying, He saved me</i>

327
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:18,453
I really should go.

328
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:22,119
<i>Buried, He carried
my sins far away</i>

329
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:23,760
Seriously... Look,
I really need to get going.

330
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:26,454
Sorry about that, I gotta get back to work.
Sounds great.

331
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:28,098
When you get a minute,
fix that taillight, okay?

332
00:37:28,122 --> 00:37:29,712
I'll do it
right away, sir.

333
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,710
Have a good day, guys.
God bless.

334
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:33,592
God bless!

335
00:37:35,963 --> 00:37:37,133
Power to the people.

336
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:39,428
Stick it to the man.

337
00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:23,179
They're just
standing there.

338
00:38:42,863 --> 00:38:44,493
I miss Mom.

339
00:39:10,641 --> 00:39:12,061
Hey.

340
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:19,189
No. No Esperanto.
I'm not joking.

341
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:25,159
No foreign language unless the
language is spoken by all.

342
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:26,369
You know the rule.

343
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:40,918
No Esperanto! Please.

344
00:39:41,756 --> 00:39:42,836
I'm hungry.

345
00:39:42,923 --> 00:39:46,093
Well, then maybe one of you should
have shot the fucking sheep.

346
00:39:57,271 --> 00:39:58,691
They have hot dogs!

347
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:03,191
What's "cola"?
Poison water.

348
00:40:03,277 --> 00:40:04,713
Can I have
the grilled cheese?

349
00:40:04,737 --> 00:40:05,737
No.

350
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,280
What's a "milkshake"?

351
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:09,374
Dad, can I have
a hamburger and fries?

352
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,450
Can I have pancakes?

353
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:14,212
Okay, everyone up.
We're outta here.

354
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:15,708
What? No, why?

355
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:19,290
Because there's no actual
food on this menu. Let's go.

356
00:41:22,815 --> 00:41:24,105
Are you okay?

357
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:28,526
An old man's having a heart attack!
Call 911!

358
00:41:29,196 --> 00:41:30,526
Call 911!

359
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:33,198
Everyone, get back!

360
00:41:34,118 --> 00:41:35,118
My pills!

361
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:02,312
I'm okay.
He's okay now.

362
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:04,399
Sir?
Sorry.

363
00:42:05,733 --> 00:42:07,193
Sir?

364
00:42:07,735 --> 00:42:08,985
Sir?

365
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:11,698
Sir?
Sorry about the fuss.

366
00:42:12,072 --> 00:42:13,842
Are you sure we can't get you
an ambulance or anything?

367
00:42:13,866 --> 00:42:16,156
No, I just forgot
to take my pills.

368
00:42:16,243 --> 00:42:18,253
I'm fine now, really.

369
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:40,175
Where else
can we improve?

370
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:43,267
Flawed exit strategy.
Everyone went out the same doors.

371
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:45,435
No one utilized the
loading dock area at all.

372
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:47,694
If it got blocked, we'd all be trapped.
Mmm-hmm.

373
00:42:47,775 --> 00:42:49,685
Inadequately planned
extraction point.

374
00:42:49,777 --> 00:42:51,755
We probably shouldn't have all
gone directly to the bus.

375
00:42:51,779 --> 00:42:54,199
Predetermined pick-ups would
have been much less risky.

376
00:42:54,281 --> 00:42:56,741
On the plus side,
Mission: Free the Food, accomplished.

377
00:42:56,867 --> 00:42:59,287
Mission: Free the Food!
Top marks all around.

378
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:02,120
Now, if you'd all do me a
favor and close your eyes.

379
00:43:06,794 --> 00:43:08,804
You may open your eyes.

380
00:43:09,755 --> 00:43:11,566
Happy Noam Chomsky Day.

381
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,470
But Noam was born
on December 7th.

382
00:43:13,592 --> 00:43:14,972
Well, we're
celebrating it today.

383
00:43:17,221 --> 00:43:18,221
Yes!

384
00:43:28,107 --> 00:43:29,567
So good.

385
00:43:41,287 --> 00:43:45,117
<i>Uncle Noam,
it's the day of your birth!</i>

386
00:43:45,207 --> 00:43:48,377
<i>Uncle Noam,
it's the day of your birth!</i>

387
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:52,630
<i>Uncle Noam, it's the day
of your birth! Uncle Noam!</i>

388
00:43:52,715 --> 00:43:57,715
<i>Uncle Noam, Uncle Noam!</i>

389
00:43:57,845 --> 00:43:59,005
All hail!

390
00:44:01,432 --> 00:44:03,602
Here we go. Nai.
Yes.

391
00:44:03,684 --> 00:44:05,064
Bodevan.
Thank you.

392
00:44:05,144 --> 00:44:06,154
Rellian.

393
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,650
Rell.

394
00:44:09,732 --> 00:44:12,402
Kielyr, Vespyr, Zaj.

395
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:13,494
All right, go for it.

396
00:44:14,737 --> 00:44:15,987
Dad!

397
00:44:16,447 --> 00:44:19,447
Fifty-five-pound pull,
laminated wood and glass.

398
00:44:19,616 --> 00:44:20,616
Whoa!

399
00:44:21,327 --> 00:44:22,997
A KA-BAR fighting knife?

400
00:44:23,078 --> 00:44:24,748
That's right.
Thanks, Dad!

401
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,290
It's so beautiful.

402
00:44:26,623 --> 00:44:28,383
Seven-inch blade,
partially serrated,

403
00:44:28,459 --> 00:44:30,589
well-balanced if
you dip when you cut.

404
00:44:31,754 --> 00:44:32,764
Pictures.

405
00:44:35,007 --> 00:44:36,007
Oh.

406
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:38,841
Those are Black Storm broadheads.
Razor sharp.

407
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:44,980
What kind of crazy person
celebrates Noam Chomsky's birthday

408
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:46,979
like it's some kind
of official holiday?

409
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:50,159
Why can't we celebrate Christmas
like the rest of the entire world?

410
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:54,322
You would prefer to celebrate
a magical fictitious elf

411
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:56,571
instead of
a living humanitarian

412
00:44:56,653 --> 00:44:59,663
who's done so much to promote
human rights and understanding?

413
00:45:00,491 --> 00:45:02,451
Okay, well,
let's have a discourse.

414
00:45:05,788 --> 00:45:07,868
- Forget it.
- No, explain.

415
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:11,213
Take the opportunity
to make your case.

416
00:45:11,293 --> 00:45:12,923
We're all open to hearing
your arguments.

417
00:45:13,003 --> 00:45:14,923
And if they're valid
and you persuade us,

418
00:45:15,005 --> 00:45:18,125
I'm sure we'd all be willing
to change our minds. Right?

419
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:21,351
- Yeah.
- Use your words.

420
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,620
Ah!

421
00:45:54,128 --> 00:45:57,588
Yes! Thanks, Dad!
You're welcome.

422
00:46:25,868 --> 00:46:26,948
Do you guys need a hand?

423
00:46:27,035 --> 00:46:29,075
- No, we're fine.
- No, we got it.

424
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:31,789
All right.

425
00:46:31,874 --> 00:46:34,334
Jackson, not at the table.
Hey.

426
00:46:34,835 --> 00:46:37,165
Jackson.
All right.

427
00:46:38,422 --> 00:46:40,592
Well, I am so happy

428
00:46:40,674 --> 00:46:44,054
that our family is together.

429
00:46:44,803 --> 00:46:46,433
Thanks for
putting on this feast.

430
00:46:47,306 --> 00:46:51,096
It's all local and, um,
organic and non-GMO, so...

431
00:46:51,185 --> 00:46:52,685
How did you kill
those chickens?

432
00:46:52,936 --> 00:46:54,686
With an ax
or a knife?

433
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:01,740
I didn't have
to kill the chickens.

434
00:47:03,906 --> 00:47:06,446
It's a rotisserie chicken,
so you buy it.

435
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:09,453
It's already dead.
Or cooked. On a thing.

436
00:47:13,999 --> 00:47:15,999
- Dig in.
- All right.

437
00:47:18,378 --> 00:47:20,708
Ben, some wine?
Please.

438
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:26,891
Dad, can I have
some wine?

439
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:30,140
- Sure, why not?
- Ben. No.

440
00:47:30,224 --> 00:47:31,524
Children don't drink wine.

441
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,730
In France,
and other countries,

442
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:35,497
children drink small amounts
of wine all the time.

443
00:47:35,521 --> 00:47:37,811
It's a digestive.
It's not crack.

444
00:47:37,898 --> 00:47:39,228
What's crack?

445
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:44,110
Crack is a crystallized,
highly addictive derivative

446
00:47:44,196 --> 00:47:45,486
of the stimulant cocaine.

447
00:47:45,781 --> 00:47:47,201
In the mid-1980s,

448
00:47:47,282 --> 00:47:49,792
it accelerated the decimation
of inner-city neighborhoods.

449
00:47:49,868 --> 00:47:52,618
Crackheads, some of them kids
just like you guys,

450
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:56,384
were killing each other over nothing,
over their Nikes.

451
00:47:56,667 --> 00:47:58,537
They killed each
other for Nike?

452
00:47:58,627 --> 00:48:00,547
The Greek winged
goddess of victory?

453
00:48:03,382 --> 00:48:05,762
Stop.
He's joking, right?

454
00:48:07,803 --> 00:48:10,603
They're like Adidas.
Who's Adidas?

455
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:12,467
You're serious?

456
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,770
They're shoes.

457
00:48:22,025 --> 00:48:23,025
Now.

458
00:48:24,528 --> 00:48:25,698
Ben.

459
00:48:25,779 --> 00:48:27,239
We're, uh...

460
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:31,489
I'm sorry for your loss.

461
00:48:31,577 --> 00:48:33,367
We're devastated.

462
00:48:34,997 --> 00:48:39,287
We're just so sorry.
Thank you, Dave.

463
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,720
I don't know what else to say.
I'm like...

464
00:48:45,799 --> 00:48:49,139
It's okay. We all know you
had issues with Leslie.

465
00:48:49,678 --> 00:48:51,598
- What?
- It's not a secret.

466
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,060
I wouldn't say that.
Why would you...

467
00:48:54,141 --> 00:48:55,994
Last time we saw you, you
called her a "fucking bitch."

468
00:48:56,018 --> 00:48:58,688
- Ben.
- What? It's fine.

469
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:01,316
My kids remember.
Don't you, guys?

470
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:02,768
Yeah.

471
00:49:02,858 --> 00:49:06,648
Wait, no.
I said that...

472
00:49:08,155 --> 00:49:12,655
We were all having a huge,
uh, fight about sugar.

473
00:49:12,909 --> 00:49:16,539
I had given the kids some,
what, Frosted Mini-Wheats.

474
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:18,833
And the extremity
of her position...

475
00:49:20,334 --> 00:49:22,714
She was yelling at me,
she pushed me, and I said...

476
00:49:22,836 --> 00:49:23,980
"Don't be such
a fucking bitch."

477
00:49:24,004 --> 00:49:25,014
Ben.
I didn't say that.

478
00:49:25,088 --> 00:49:27,968
They're just words.
Your words, but just words.

479
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:29,130
Not spoken
in this house.

480
00:49:29,217 --> 00:49:32,387
No, it's inappropriate for him to
say that in front of the kids.

481
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:38,020
Absolutely, understood.
It won't happen again.

482
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:39,101
Okay.

483
00:49:49,404 --> 00:49:51,244
Dad, how did
Aunt Leslie die?

484
00:49:51,365 --> 00:49:53,195
Well,
Aunt Leslie was sick

485
00:49:53,283 --> 00:49:57,663
and she had, uh, complications
from her sickness.

486
00:49:57,746 --> 00:49:58,786
Yeah.

487
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:03,041
She had a mental illness.

488
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,210
Bipolar affective disorder.

489
00:50:05,462 --> 00:50:07,462
We think it started
right after Bo was born.

490
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:10,217
Probably a form of
postpartum psychosis.

491
00:50:11,093 --> 00:50:14,393
She'd have violent mood
swings ranging from mania,

492
00:50:14,471 --> 00:50:15,721
where she'd be elated

493
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:18,889
and make elaborate
plans for the future,

494
00:50:18,975 --> 00:50:21,765
to severe depression where
she'd become almost catatonic.

495
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:25,110
Utterly without hope.

496
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:29,193
We didn't understand
what was happening.

497
00:50:29,277 --> 00:50:31,737
We don't need to talk about
this in front of the children.

498
00:50:31,822 --> 00:50:33,383
These are details that are...

499
00:50:33,407 --> 00:50:37,657
The doctors, uh, put her
in the hospital,

500
00:50:37,744 --> 00:50:41,714
they gave her medicine,
but she was really sick.

501
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:46,460
Yeah.
And she died.

502
00:50:49,798 --> 00:50:51,258
Sick people die.

503
00:50:55,137 --> 00:50:58,307
Sometimes they...
They die.

504
00:50:59,182 --> 00:51:01,442
She died 'cause of...

505
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,810
Because of...
Because of the sickness.

506
00:51:05,939 --> 00:51:06,939
She slit her wrists.

507
00:51:07,441 --> 00:51:09,651
She killed herself.
That's what happened.

508
00:51:10,277 --> 00:51:11,277
Or that.

509
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:26,955
Excuse me.

510
00:51:40,348 --> 00:51:42,478
Here you go, sweetie.
Thank you.

511
00:51:45,187 --> 00:51:46,267
Bo.

512
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:58,491
- To Mom.
- To Mom.

513
00:52:03,163 --> 00:52:04,333
Shh.

514
00:52:09,503 --> 00:52:11,003
<i>Combo!</i>

515
00:52:14,299 --> 00:52:15,759
<i>Extreme combo!</i>

516
00:52:17,177 --> 00:52:18,797
<i>Victory!</i>

517
00:52:21,473 --> 00:52:23,103
We're just doing
the best we can, Ben!

518
00:52:23,225 --> 00:52:24,619
That's all anybody is doing!
So am I!

519
00:52:24,643 --> 00:52:26,063
Just the best
that we know how.

520
00:52:26,186 --> 00:52:28,372
I'm really sorry it doesn't
live up to your high standards!

521
00:52:28,396 --> 00:52:30,208
I tell the truth to my kids.
I don't lie to my kids.

522
00:52:30,232 --> 00:52:32,902
Protecting children
from certain concepts

523
00:52:33,026 --> 00:52:34,566
that they are too young
to understand

524
00:52:34,694 --> 00:52:35,694
is not lying to them.

525
00:52:35,737 --> 00:52:38,197
Guys! We have
neighbors, okay?

526
00:52:38,865 --> 00:52:42,115
Look, it's a very
hard time right now.

527
00:52:42,202 --> 00:52:43,502
Everybody's still
a little raw.

528
00:52:43,578 --> 00:52:47,708
Can we just try to, come on,
put this to bed, all right?

529
00:52:54,339 --> 00:52:55,549
I apologize.

530
00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:00,390
I'm sorry for not respecting the way
you guys do things in your home.

531
00:53:03,431 --> 00:53:05,231
Thank you for saying that.

532
00:53:11,189 --> 00:53:14,989
I know Leslie had been sick for a long
time, but I cannot imagine how difficult

533
00:53:15,068 --> 00:53:17,028
this time must be for you.

534
00:53:32,294 --> 00:53:34,214
Guys,
what are you doing?

535
00:53:34,296 --> 00:53:35,916
We're sleeping
under the stars.

536
00:53:36,923 --> 00:53:37,923
But...

537
00:53:37,966 --> 00:53:39,756
We made up
the rec room downstairs,

538
00:53:39,885 --> 00:53:41,255
- for a sleepover.
- Yeah.

539
00:53:42,429 --> 00:53:45,809
We're fine here.
We're fine.

540
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:49,139
Good.

541
00:54:03,617 --> 00:54:05,327
Why do they
have to take showers?

542
00:54:05,452 --> 00:54:07,513
They're not taking a shower.
I mean, it looks like a shower,

543
00:54:07,537 --> 00:54:09,348
but it's really a gas chamber.

544
00:54:09,372 --> 00:54:10,725
Jackson,
put that thing away

545
00:54:10,749 --> 00:54:13,289
or I'm going to put it in the
microwave, press "Popcorn."

546
00:54:13,376 --> 00:54:14,456
All right.

547
00:54:14,586 --> 00:54:16,188
Actually, why don't
you take your cousins

548
00:54:16,212 --> 00:54:18,382
and go show them
your action figure guys?

549
00:54:18,465 --> 00:54:19,545
Why?

550
00:54:19,633 --> 00:54:20,943
Because they may never
have seen them before.

551
00:54:20,967 --> 00:54:21,967
It might be fun.

552
00:54:22,052 --> 00:54:24,102
So, can we play
Xbox afterwards?

553
00:54:24,471 --> 00:54:25,721
One game. Go.

554
00:54:25,805 --> 00:54:26,885
Yes!

555
00:54:28,642 --> 00:54:31,482
Thank you. Yeah, try it.

556
00:54:39,986 --> 00:54:42,316
How are the kids doing?
They're strong.

557
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:46,636
How long have you been out there,
wherever it is you're living now?

558
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,660
We left Boulder
when Bo was three.

559
00:54:49,663 --> 00:54:51,793
And then we were on that
farm we had in Oregon

560
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:53,420
until he was eight.

561
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,500
So, we bought the land
in the forest 10 years ago.

562
00:54:55,627 --> 00:54:57,127
How do you still
have money?

563
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:00,149
We only buy what we need.

564
00:55:00,173 --> 00:55:03,013
Look, Harper and I
have been talking.

565
00:55:04,636 --> 00:55:06,426
The kids need
structure, stability.

566
00:55:06,513 --> 00:55:08,523
They need to go
to a real school,

567
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,493
so they can get real jobs.
Oh, for Christ's sake.

568
00:55:10,517 --> 00:55:11,807
You're going to
get them killed!

569
00:55:11,977 --> 00:55:13,187
Whoa.

570
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:21,530
I'm sorry.

571
00:55:21,653 --> 00:55:23,703
But your kids are
without a mother now.

572
00:55:23,822 --> 00:55:26,702
I don't think you have any idea
what you're doing to them.

573
00:55:26,825 --> 00:55:29,365
I'm saving their lives,
that's what I'm doing.

574
00:55:29,452 --> 00:55:31,792
Ben, you sound
so ridiculous.

575
00:55:31,871 --> 00:55:35,631
Is knowing how to set a broken bone or
how to treat a severe burn ridiculous?

576
00:55:35,709 --> 00:55:37,959
Knowing how to navigate by
the stars in total darkness,

577
00:55:38,044 --> 00:55:39,344
that's ridiculous?

578
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:41,378
How to identify
edible plants,

579
00:55:41,464 --> 00:55:43,224
how to make clothes
from animal skins,

580
00:55:43,299 --> 00:55:45,419
how to survive in the forest
with nothing but a knife?

581
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:46,720
That's ridiculous
to you?

582
00:55:47,137 --> 00:55:48,137
Jesus.

583
00:55:48,221 --> 00:55:49,971
They have
the cardiovascular

584
00:55:50,056 --> 00:55:51,867
and muscular endurance
levels of elite athletes.

585
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:53,981
Who cares?
They're children.

586
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,940
They need to go to school, they
need to learn about the world.

587
00:55:59,733 --> 00:56:02,193
Justin? Jackson?

588
00:56:02,527 --> 00:56:04,897
Would you please come
down here for a second?

589
00:56:15,165 --> 00:56:16,245
What?

590
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:18,843
How old are you now,
Jackson?

591
00:56:18,918 --> 00:56:20,088
Thirteen.

592
00:56:22,172 --> 00:56:24,422
Can you tell me what
the Bill of Rights is?

593
00:56:27,761 --> 00:56:30,101
What something costs?
I guess.

594
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:31,601
That's a good guess.

595
00:56:31,723 --> 00:56:34,023
Justin, you're in high school?
Yeah.

596
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:37,310
Do you like your school?
It's whatever.

597
00:56:39,272 --> 00:56:40,792
Do you know what
the Bill of Rights is?

598
00:56:42,525 --> 00:56:44,605
It's a government
thing, right?

599
00:56:44,736 --> 00:56:47,356
Like, rights that people
have in America and stuff...

600
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:51,027
- Yep. Hey, Zaja!
- Yes!

601
00:56:51,451 --> 00:56:54,121
Would you please come down
here a moment, sweetie?

602
00:56:56,623 --> 00:56:58,423
I wanted to ask you
a quick question.

603
00:56:59,209 --> 00:57:01,419
Zaja just turned eight,
by the way.

604
00:57:02,879 --> 00:57:04,049
Bill of Rights.

605
00:57:04,923 --> 00:57:07,383
Amendment 1,
Congress shall make no law

606
00:57:07,467 --> 00:57:09,297
respecting an establishment
of religion

607
00:57:09,636 --> 00:57:12,096
or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof,

608
00:57:12,555 --> 00:57:13,805
or abridging
the freedom of...

609
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:17,480
Stop. Regurgitating memorized
amendments isn't what I'm asking for.

610
00:57:17,811 --> 00:57:20,481
Just tell me something
about it in your own words.

611
00:57:22,816 --> 00:57:26,146
Without the Bill of Rights,
we'd be more like China.

612
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:29,359
Here, at least, we don't
have warrantless searches,

613
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:30,487
we have free speech,

614
00:57:30,573 --> 00:57:33,493
citizens are protected from cruel
and unusual punishments...

615
00:57:33,618 --> 00:57:35,078
- That's enough.
- Are protected...

616
00:57:35,161 --> 00:57:37,001
Wait a minute.
Zaja...

617
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,160
How would
you characterize

618
00:57:38,248 --> 00:57:41,418
the 2010 Supreme Court
decision on Citizens United?

619
00:57:42,794 --> 00:57:44,754
Corporations have the
same rights as people,

620
00:57:44,838 --> 00:57:46,838
so there's no spending
limit on candidates.

621
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:50,430
Which means our country
is ruled by corporations

622
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:52,680
and their lobbyists
who fund candidates

623
00:57:52,762 --> 00:57:54,490
and command their fealty
by demanding that...

624
00:57:54,514 --> 00:57:55,894
Jesus Christ.

625
00:57:56,141 --> 00:57:57,521
You made your point,
we get it.

626
00:57:59,644 --> 00:58:02,024
It's very impressive.
All of you.

627
00:59:51,798 --> 00:59:52,798
Is that yoga?

628
00:59:56,386 --> 00:59:58,886
Your breath,
they call it <i>pranayama.</i>

629
00:59:58,972 --> 01:00:01,772
It flows with your
movements, your <i>asana.</i>

630
01:00:01,933 --> 01:00:04,613
It's supposed to connect the mind
and the body to fuel your <i>Samadhi.</i>

631
01:00:06,437 --> 01:00:07,767
Does that really work?

632
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:29,337
I'm Claire.

633
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:34,299
Bodevan.
"Bodevan"?

634
01:00:35,174 --> 01:00:36,844
What kind of a name
is that?

635
01:00:41,472 --> 01:00:42,972
My parents made it up.

636
01:00:44,183 --> 01:00:45,853
That's weird. Why?

637
01:00:46,185 --> 01:00:47,395
Our names are unique.

638
01:00:48,187 --> 01:00:50,317
There's only one of
us in the whole world.

639
01:00:52,358 --> 01:00:53,648
That's really weird.

640
01:01:07,832 --> 01:01:09,882
What kind of music
do you listen to?

641
01:01:11,461 --> 01:01:12,841
Mostly Bach.

642
01:01:13,629 --> 01:01:15,299
Mainly
the <i>Goldberg Variations,</i>

643
01:01:15,381 --> 01:01:17,051
especially Glenn Gould's
versions.

644
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:19,430
I also like the
<i>Unaccompanied Cello Suites,</i>

645
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:21,470
preferably when played
by Yo-Yo Ma.

646
01:01:26,351 --> 01:01:27,811
Where are you from?

647
01:01:30,563 --> 01:01:33,073
Most recently in Paris,
in the Marais.

648
01:01:34,275 --> 01:01:35,525
Near Victor Hugo's house.

649
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:40,070
We're just back in the States
because of my dad's sabbatical.

650
01:01:40,198 --> 01:01:44,238
He's writing a book
on Dr. Spock.

651
01:01:44,327 --> 01:01:46,747
Oh. I love <i>Star Trek,</i>
it's awesome.

652
01:01:48,623 --> 01:01:49,623
Which star?

653
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:51,748
You know, Spock.

654
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:54,671
The guy with the ears,
he's from <i>Star Trek.</i>

655
01:01:54,754 --> 01:01:56,594
No, Dr. Spock was
from Connecticut.

656
01:01:56,672 --> 01:01:59,932
Right after Yale, he wrote
<i>Baby and Child Care</i> in 1947.

657
01:02:00,009 --> 01:02:02,219
It's one of the seminal
books on child-rearing.

658
01:02:02,428 --> 01:02:06,178
I was talking
about that old TV show.

659
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:08,890
Oh.

660
01:02:09,102 --> 01:02:10,852
"Child-rearing."
Of course.

661
01:02:10,937 --> 01:02:13,107
Yeah, I know
that one, it's...

662
01:02:14,315 --> 01:02:15,315
Awesome.

663
01:02:20,405 --> 01:02:21,645
And what about
your mom?

664
01:02:26,619 --> 01:02:28,289
I can't talk about it.

665
01:02:30,456 --> 01:02:32,376
She works for the U.S.
government.

666
01:02:33,835 --> 01:02:36,955
I can't talk about it due to
its highly classified nature.

667
01:02:37,046 --> 01:02:38,086
Seriously?

668
01:02:38,548 --> 01:02:40,168
I can't say any more.

669
01:02:40,258 --> 01:02:42,468
I don't even know
that much myself.

670
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:44,100
It's, um...

671
01:02:44,929 --> 01:02:47,349
I shouldn't have told you.

672
01:02:48,766 --> 01:02:50,636
You can't tell anyone.

673
01:03:22,049 --> 01:03:23,219
Are you okay?

674
01:03:26,846 --> 01:03:28,506
Yeah.

675
01:03:51,245 --> 01:03:52,325
Okay.

676
01:03:53,206 --> 01:03:54,706
Follow me.
We have to be quiet.

677
01:04:03,382 --> 01:04:05,052
It's almost midnight.

678
01:04:07,887 --> 01:04:10,177
I sincerely hope
you two lovebirds

679
01:04:10,264 --> 01:04:12,564
haven't been doing what I
think you've been doing.

680
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:20,230
I know what you think.

681
01:04:20,316 --> 01:04:22,876
But I know that your daughter has
taught me many things just now.

682
01:04:23,069 --> 01:04:26,199
She has broadened my mind,
she has helped me grow.

683
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,240
When we just kissed for
the first time just then,

684
01:04:28,324 --> 01:04:30,444
the endorphins that your
daughter sent through my body

685
01:04:30,493 --> 01:04:32,471
were like dolphins swimming
through my bloodstream.

686
01:04:32,495 --> 01:04:35,285
The way she has opened me up,
she has penetrated deep inside of me

687
01:04:35,373 --> 01:04:38,093
and I know that I have penetrated
deep, deep inside of your daughter.

688
01:04:39,418 --> 01:04:40,668
Not... Not like that.

689
01:04:40,753 --> 01:04:42,383
I would love to

690
01:04:42,463 --> 01:04:45,513
when is necessary for...

691
01:04:45,633 --> 01:04:48,303
I want kids someday.
Not right now, of course,

692
01:04:48,386 --> 01:04:49,780
but when you're ready
and when I'm ready,

693
01:04:49,804 --> 01:04:51,323
because I think this should
be a shared decision.

694
01:04:51,347 --> 01:04:53,307
This is a decision that
we should make together.

695
01:04:53,391 --> 01:04:55,641
But when you are ready,
I will be ready.

696
01:04:56,811 --> 01:05:00,021
I am ready for you,
if you will have me.

697
01:05:01,857 --> 01:05:03,187
Claire...

698
01:05:05,069 --> 01:05:06,649
What's your last name?

699
01:05:06,862 --> 01:05:08,112
M... McCune.

700
01:05:08,197 --> 01:05:09,737
Claire McCune,

701
01:05:11,117 --> 01:05:12,827
will you be my wife?

702
01:05:23,963 --> 01:05:26,843
Okay, funny man, I'm sure
your dad's waiting up.

703
01:05:28,175 --> 01:05:30,085
Don't worry,
you'll see her tomorrow.

704
01:05:31,012 --> 01:05:32,182
Good night.

705
01:06:15,348 --> 01:06:16,388
It's just a penis.

706
01:06:17,391 --> 01:06:19,141
Every man has one.

707
01:06:19,435 --> 01:06:21,725
We're all animals
of the Earth.

708
01:06:22,438 --> 01:06:24,478
Clothes when we eat.

709
01:07:59,118 --> 01:08:01,948
- You look happy.
- I am happy.

710
01:08:02,037 --> 01:08:03,207
Are you happy?

711
01:08:03,289 --> 01:08:05,249
Yeah.
I'm here with you.

712
01:08:21,432 --> 01:08:25,312
O God, to whom mercy
and forgiveness belong,

713
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:29,730
hear our prayer on behalf of
your servant Leslie Cash,

714
01:08:30,149 --> 01:08:33,109
whom you have taken
out of the world.

715
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:37,279
And because she put her
trust and hope in you,

716
01:08:37,782 --> 01:08:40,832
command that she be carried
safely home to Heaven

717
01:08:41,869 --> 01:08:43,619
and come to enjoy

718
01:08:43,704 --> 01:08:46,124
your eternal reward.

719
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,367
- Amen.
- Amen.

720
01:08:50,127 --> 01:08:51,627
Come on, guys.

721
01:09:05,476 --> 01:09:07,136
Do you mind
scooting over, sir?

722
01:09:17,488 --> 01:09:20,318
I did not
know Leslie personally

723
01:09:21,325 --> 01:09:23,445
and I am poorer for it.

724
01:09:24,286 --> 01:09:26,036
I understand

725
01:09:26,121 --> 01:09:28,791
that she was a loving mother
who gave up her law practice

726
01:09:28,874 --> 01:09:30,214
to raise her children.

727
01:09:30,835 --> 01:09:32,495
Leslie loved
her mother, Abigail,

728
01:09:32,586 --> 01:09:34,506
and her father, Jack,

729
01:09:34,588 --> 01:09:36,168
and their dogs,

730
01:09:36,966 --> 01:09:39,126
Harvey and Little Bear.

731
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:42,430
They told me that
she also loved gardening

732
01:09:42,805 --> 01:09:44,385
and classical music,

733
01:09:45,057 --> 01:09:47,137
particularly
Glenn Gould's versions

734
01:09:47,226 --> 01:09:49,516
of the <i>Goldberg Variations.</i>

735
01:09:50,437 --> 01:09:52,517
She also liked walks

736
01:09:52,606 --> 01:09:54,936
in the moonlight
on the beach.

737
01:09:55,818 --> 01:09:58,028
And she loved her husband,

738
01:09:58,112 --> 01:09:59,662
Ben, and their children...

739
01:09:59,738 --> 01:10:01,778
I'll, uh, take that
as my cue,

740
01:10:01,866 --> 01:10:02,946
if I may.

741
01:10:13,919 --> 01:10:15,089
First of all,

742
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:17,300
Leslie practiced Buddhism,

743
01:10:17,965 --> 01:10:21,335
which, to her, was a philosophy
and not an organized religion.

744
01:10:21,427 --> 01:10:24,757
In fact, Leslie abhorred
all organized religions.

745
01:10:24,847 --> 01:10:28,267
To her, they were the most dangerous
fairy tales ever invented.

746
01:10:28,559 --> 01:10:30,729
Designed to elicit
blind obedience

747
01:10:30,853 --> 01:10:33,023
and strike fear into the
hearts of the innocent

748
01:10:33,105 --> 01:10:34,708
and the uninformed.

749
01:10:34,732 --> 01:10:37,072
To her, the only thing
worse than death

750
01:10:37,276 --> 01:10:39,396
would have been the knowledge
that her rotting flesh

751
01:10:39,486 --> 01:10:41,906
was to be trapped for all
eternity inside a big box

752
01:10:43,532 --> 01:10:45,802
and buried in the
middle of a fucking golf course.

753
01:10:49,163 --> 01:10:51,793
Although the absurdity
of being eulogized

754
01:10:51,874 --> 01:10:54,004
by someone that
didn't even know her

755
01:10:54,084 --> 01:10:56,094
has exactly the kind
of comedic flourish

756
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:58,210
that Leslie
would have cherished.

757
01:10:58,547 --> 01:11:00,667
If nothing else,
she had a sense of humor.

758
01:11:01,634 --> 01:11:05,184
I want to read something to all of you,
so you'll know what I mean.

759
01:11:06,138 --> 01:11:08,598
Leslie's last will
and testament.

760
01:11:08,724 --> 01:11:11,274
And I quote,
"In the event of my death,

761
01:11:11,352 --> 01:11:13,562
"I, Leslie Abigail Cash,

762
01:11:13,646 --> 01:11:15,686
"as a Buddhist,
wish to be cremated.

763
01:11:15,773 --> 01:11:17,613
"My funeral,
such as it is,

764
01:11:17,691 --> 01:11:20,191
"shall be a celebration
of the life cycle,

765
01:11:20,277 --> 01:11:22,397
"with music and dancing.

766
01:11:22,863 --> 01:11:25,623
"After, it is my expressed
desire that my ashes

767
01:11:25,908 --> 01:11:28,238
"shall be taken to
a nondescript location,

768
01:11:28,327 --> 01:11:30,697
"preferably public
and heavily populated.

769
01:11:30,788 --> 01:11:32,158
"At which point my ashes,

770
01:11:32,247 --> 01:11:34,377
"promptly and unceremoniously,

771
01:11:34,458 --> 01:11:36,538
"are to be flushed
down the nearest toilet."

772
01:11:37,002 --> 01:11:38,802
End quote.

773
01:11:39,964 --> 01:11:41,174
Now, that's comedy.

774
01:11:41,256 --> 01:11:42,859
- All right, that's enough.
- I'm not finished.

775
01:11:42,883 --> 01:11:44,763
Hey, I'm not finished.

776
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:46,450
Dad!
You're not listening to me!

777
01:11:46,512 --> 01:11:47,992
- This is not what she wanted!
- Dad!

778
01:11:48,055 --> 01:11:49,449
- Just keep moving forward.
- Let go of me!

779
01:11:49,473 --> 01:11:50,643
Okay, that's it,
come on.

780
01:11:50,724 --> 01:11:52,854
- Dad!
- She's my wife!

781
01:11:52,935 --> 01:11:56,015
This is her will! This
is against her wishes!

782
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:59,690
God damn it!
We have songs to sing!

783
01:11:59,775 --> 01:12:00,935
Dad!

784
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:02,990
If you'll open
your books,

785
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:09,120
we'll read this morning from
Matthew 18, verses 15-20.

786
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:48,120
You are the worst thing that has
ever happened to my family.

787
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:50,580
Why won't you respect
your daughter's wishes?

788
01:12:50,659 --> 01:12:52,119
Or your grandchildren's?

789
01:12:52,578 --> 01:12:53,908
Hi, kids.

790
01:12:54,913 --> 01:12:56,623
Hello, Grandpa,
I'm Nai.

791
01:12:56,749 --> 01:12:58,499
Nai.
We've never met.

792
01:12:58,584 --> 01:12:59,754
Gee, Abby.

793
01:12:59,835 --> 01:13:02,245
I'm sorry. Sorry.

794
01:13:05,591 --> 01:13:06,931
Hi, honey.

795
01:13:07,885 --> 01:13:10,885
Grandma!

796
01:13:11,096 --> 01:13:12,636
Hello, Grandma.

797
01:13:12,848 --> 01:13:16,098
We're all together.
Isn't this wonderful?

798
01:13:16,185 --> 01:13:18,645
Abby and I are going to take
the children to the ceremony

799
01:13:18,771 --> 01:13:20,811
and then you can
follow us to the house.

800
01:13:21,273 --> 01:13:23,903
They're my kids,
they're staying with me.

801
01:13:23,984 --> 01:13:26,654
Children, I'm sorry that
you have to witness this,

802
01:13:26,779 --> 01:13:29,109
but I don't think your father
is fit to attend the funeral.

803
01:13:29,198 --> 01:13:31,118
We're not going to let you
put her in the ground!

804
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,360
Who do you think the police
are going to listen to? Me?

805
01:13:33,786 --> 01:13:36,116
Or some hippie
in a clown outfit?

806
01:13:36,872 --> 01:13:37,962
Come on, Abby.

807
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,120
Where are we going?

808
01:13:39,208 --> 01:13:40,602
We're going to see Leslie.
We have to go.

809
01:13:40,626 --> 01:13:41,770
I'm visiting
with the children.

810
01:13:41,794 --> 01:13:42,937
We have to
see them at the house.

811
01:13:42,961 --> 01:13:44,606
Would you just give me a
minute with the children?

812
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:46,010
Honey, honey,
Leslie is waiting.

813
01:13:46,131 --> 01:13:47,971
Leslie is waiting.
Come on.

814
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:50,550
Bye, Grandma.

815
01:13:50,636 --> 01:13:51,836
Bye,
Grandma and Grandpa.

816
01:13:57,726 --> 01:13:59,646
Back on Steve,
let's go.

817
01:14:00,145 --> 01:14:01,855
- Dad?
- Let's go.

818
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:03,208
Dad,
where are we going?

819
01:14:03,232 --> 01:14:04,793
We're going to stop
this fucking funeral!

820
01:14:04,817 --> 01:14:06,487
- Dad!
- No!

821
01:14:06,568 --> 01:14:07,568
Dad!

822
01:14:08,403 --> 01:14:09,573
Dad, we can't go.

823
01:14:09,655 --> 01:14:10,965
Please,
just listen to us.

824
01:14:10,989 --> 01:14:13,159
Why can't we go to Mom's funeral?
Because of Dad.

825
01:14:13,242 --> 01:14:14,542
Because of his speech?
Yes!

826
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:17,250
Everyone shut up and sit down!
Sit the fuck down!

827
01:14:17,329 --> 01:14:18,499
Dad.
Silence!

828
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:20,419
Put your goddamn
seat belts on!

829
01:14:20,499 --> 01:14:21,976
- No! Stop Steve!
- You heard Grandpa!

830
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,311
He'll have us arrested
if we show up!

831
01:14:23,335 --> 01:14:25,135
They are not stopping us
from saving Mom!

832
01:14:25,212 --> 01:14:26,422
Dad, abort the mission!

833
01:14:26,505 --> 01:14:28,505
Let's just go home!
Abort the mission!

834
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:29,970
We are rescuing Mom!

835
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:31,402
Mom is dead, okay, Dad?
She's dead!

836
01:14:31,426 --> 01:14:32,987
This is not what she would
have wanted you to do!

837
01:14:33,011 --> 01:14:35,221
They have no right!
I don't want to lose you!

838
01:14:36,932 --> 01:14:40,442
Please. We can't
lose you, too.

839
01:15:09,047 --> 01:15:10,627
Motherfuck!

840
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:28,955
I have memories of Mom

841
01:16:30,462 --> 01:16:31,462
laughing.

842
01:16:35,133 --> 01:16:37,513
I... I can't even
remember when that was.

843
01:16:45,811 --> 01:16:48,481
Mom had
psychotic episodes.

844
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:51,480
She had hallucinations.

845
01:16:54,486 --> 01:16:56,486
Of smashing our
heads in with rocks.

846
01:16:57,489 --> 01:16:59,159
I heard them
talking about it.

847
01:17:04,871 --> 01:17:07,251
Mom was sicker
than any of us knew.

848
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:10,000
Dad made her crazy.

849
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,840
Dad's dangerous.

850
01:17:22,681 --> 01:17:24,851
You think our lives
are so great.

851
01:17:25,267 --> 01:17:27,517
You think Dad
is so perfect.

852
01:18:06,224 --> 01:18:08,694
Yale, Stanford,
Princeton, Harvard,

853
01:18:08,769 --> 01:18:11,729
Dartmouth, MIT, Brown.

854
01:18:21,281 --> 01:18:22,571
Well done.

855
01:18:23,617 --> 01:18:24,787
Thank you.

856
01:18:25,369 --> 01:18:26,619
It's very impressive.

857
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:34,540
I guess. Yeah.

858
01:18:37,589 --> 01:18:40,259
All this time
you've been deceiving me?

859
01:18:43,053 --> 01:18:45,013
What? No.
I took you to the library,

860
01:18:45,097 --> 01:18:48,097
and you snuck around behind
my back taking SAT tests

861
01:18:48,225 --> 01:18:51,135
and contacting universities?
Dad, it's not like that.

862
01:18:51,269 --> 01:18:52,669
We're not an accredited
home school,

863
01:18:52,771 --> 01:18:54,731
I don't know
how the fuck you did it.

864
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,530
I guess you somehow...
You don't understand.

865
01:18:57,609 --> 01:19:00,213
...managed to create acceptable
transcripts, got your work approved.

866
01:19:00,237 --> 01:19:01,277
Listen.

867
01:19:01,405 --> 01:19:02,715
All without my knowledge
and approval.

868
01:19:02,739 --> 01:19:03,739
Listen, Dad, please.

869
01:19:03,824 --> 01:19:05,224
I don't know
what's more impressive.

870
01:19:05,283 --> 01:19:07,053
The fact that you got into
all these fine schools

871
01:19:07,077 --> 01:19:10,457
or that for months you've been
lying directly to my face.

872
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:11,920
It was Mom.

873
01:19:17,629 --> 01:19:20,629
She helped me with everything.
We did it together.

874
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:25,795
I just want to go to college.
You speak six languages!

875
01:19:25,929 --> 01:19:27,448
You have high math,
theoretical physics!

876
01:19:27,472 --> 01:19:28,950
Dad! But this is what
I'm talking about!

877
01:19:28,974 --> 01:19:30,284
What the hell are these
people going to teach you?

878
01:19:30,308 --> 01:19:32,018
I know nothing!

879
01:19:32,144 --> 01:19:35,774
I know nothing!
I am a freak because of you!

880
01:19:35,981 --> 01:19:38,481
You made us freaks!

881
01:19:38,608 --> 01:19:40,488
And Mom knew that!
She understood!

882
01:19:41,653 --> 01:19:43,783
Unless it comes out
of a fucking book,

883
01:19:43,864 --> 01:19:46,664
I don't know anything
about anything!

884
01:20:12,017 --> 01:20:13,017
Dad?

885
01:20:15,145 --> 01:20:16,625
You should put some
clothes on, buddy.

886
01:20:29,201 --> 01:20:32,001
No, stay on Steve.
I'll be right back.

887
01:20:37,834 --> 01:20:39,134
Where is he?
No.

888
01:20:39,211 --> 01:20:40,301
Abby, I need Rell.

889
01:20:40,378 --> 01:20:41,522
It won't work like this,
you know Jack.

890
01:20:41,546 --> 01:20:42,546
He's my son.

891
01:20:46,218 --> 01:20:47,428
All right.

892
01:20:48,887 --> 01:20:51,387
It's all about timing.
Just be easy.

893
01:20:54,059 --> 01:20:55,389
Follow through.

894
01:21:00,065 --> 01:21:02,525
- Okay, get your things.
- Just a minute, please.

895
01:21:02,609 --> 01:21:03,859
Come on, Rell.

896
01:21:04,277 --> 01:21:05,947
I said, just a minute.

897
01:21:06,738 --> 01:21:09,528
I've clearly upset you
and I apologize.

898
01:21:09,616 --> 01:21:11,076
You killed Mom!

899
01:21:11,159 --> 01:21:12,239
Oh.

900
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:22,920
I heard you.

901
01:21:24,923 --> 01:21:26,523
I heard you fighting
about where we live.

902
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:29,430
Mom wanted to leave.
I heard.

903
01:21:30,595 --> 01:21:33,425
Your mother and I made
certain decisions, together,

904
01:21:33,515 --> 01:21:34,875
about what was best
for all of you.

905
01:21:34,933 --> 01:21:37,943
I'm going to live here
with Nana and Grandpa.

906
01:21:38,353 --> 01:21:42,943
That's not possible. Come on,
get your stuff. Let's go.

907
01:21:45,777 --> 01:21:46,777
Let's go!

908
01:21:47,779 --> 01:21:51,199
I hate you!
I fucking hate you!

909
01:21:51,283 --> 01:21:52,283
Rellian.

910
01:21:54,953 --> 01:21:56,203
Rellian.

911
01:22:02,377 --> 01:22:04,707
What the fuck?
That almost hit me!

912
01:22:04,796 --> 01:22:06,716
If I wanted to hit you,
I would have hit you.

913
01:22:06,798 --> 01:22:08,048
You just shot
an arrow at me!

914
01:22:08,133 --> 01:22:10,223
You told me they
were in school.

915
01:22:13,054 --> 01:22:14,314
They are.

916
01:22:15,056 --> 01:22:16,386
Leslie and I
are their teachers.

917
01:22:16,474 --> 01:22:17,984
Are...
Were their teachers.

918
01:22:18,059 --> 01:22:20,059
So you're teaching them
to steal?

919
01:22:20,145 --> 01:22:21,145
Of course not.

920
01:22:21,229 --> 01:22:22,979
"Mission:
Free the Food"?

921
01:22:24,816 --> 01:22:26,566
That was part of
their training.

922
01:22:26,651 --> 01:22:28,651
So you're training them
to steal?

923
01:22:29,988 --> 01:22:32,118
Their mother
had just died.

924
01:22:32,324 --> 01:22:34,414
They were in shock,
they were devastated,

925
01:22:34,492 --> 01:22:35,832
they needed a distraction.

926
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:37,330
So we made it
Noam Chomsky Day.

927
01:22:37,454 --> 01:22:38,914
"Noam Chomsky Day."

928
01:22:38,997 --> 01:22:40,417
I don't even
know who that is.

929
01:22:40,498 --> 01:22:43,628
That's the day you gave my
grandchildren real weapons.

930
01:22:46,671 --> 01:22:48,671
How did Rellian
break his hand?

931
01:22:51,343 --> 01:22:54,933
He slip... He fell.
And it's not broken.

932
01:22:55,013 --> 01:22:57,103
He was climbing on a
rock face in the rain.

933
01:22:57,182 --> 01:22:58,772
It was an accident.

934
01:22:58,850 --> 01:23:00,570
And it wasn't raining
when we were climbing.

935
01:23:00,644 --> 01:23:02,604
He has bruises
over his whole body.

936
01:23:02,687 --> 01:23:04,937
Yeah, and scratches.
We all have them.

937
01:23:05,023 --> 01:23:06,113
It's child abuse.

938
01:23:06,191 --> 01:23:09,191
Even if they make it through
whatever it is you're doing to them,

939
01:23:09,277 --> 01:23:12,107
they're going to be totally
unprepared for the real world.

940
01:23:12,197 --> 01:23:14,487
And I happen to think
the opposite is true.

941
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:18,450
Rellian is legally
old enough to choose,

942
01:23:18,536 --> 01:23:20,706
and I intend
to honor his wishes.

943
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:27,710
This is
my lawyer's card.

944
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:31,300
Abby and I have decided
that we're going to file

945
01:23:31,383 --> 01:23:33,303
for custody of the children.

946
01:23:33,385 --> 01:23:34,820
Now, I know you don't
own a telephone,

947
01:23:34,844 --> 01:23:37,894
but I suggest you find one
immediately and call him.

948
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:41,230
Because I would hate to have to
issue a warrant for your arrest.

949
01:23:41,309 --> 01:23:42,729
He's my son.

950
01:23:43,353 --> 01:23:45,363
I'm not leaving
without him, Jack.

951
01:23:45,814 --> 01:23:47,024
Fine.

952
01:23:51,736 --> 01:23:55,366
Who's this?
Hey, hello, Bill, how are you?

953
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:59,330
It's Jack Bertrang
from up in Coronado.

954
01:23:59,411 --> 01:24:01,331
Listen, I think
I just saw a prowler

955
01:24:01,413 --> 01:24:03,163
wandering around
outside on my grounds.

956
01:24:03,248 --> 01:24:06,378
I wonder if you'd send a car.
Thanks. Yeah.

957
01:24:08,586 --> 01:24:11,666
I hope you can explain Rellian's
injuries to the police,

958
01:24:11,756 --> 01:24:13,086
because I can't.

959
01:24:33,528 --> 01:24:35,738
Yes, thanks very much.
Sure thing, Mr. Bertrang.

960
01:24:47,542 --> 01:24:50,882
Okay, prisoner located.

961
01:24:50,962 --> 01:24:52,552
Second floor,
second window,

962
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:54,050
above the garage.

963
01:24:57,385 --> 01:24:58,505
Target locked.

964
01:24:59,471 --> 01:25:00,641
Bring him home, Vesp.

965
01:26:25,974 --> 01:26:27,064
Dad!

966
01:26:27,141 --> 01:26:28,981
- Vespyr!
- Dad!

967
01:26:29,936 --> 01:26:32,356
- Vespyr!
- Dad!

968
01:26:56,546 --> 01:26:58,206
Mr. Cash?

969
01:27:05,847 --> 01:27:07,267
She's got
a decent concussion,

970
01:27:07,348 --> 01:27:08,518
but we did a CAT scan,

971
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,440
and there's absolutely
no damage to the brain.

972
01:27:10,852 --> 01:27:13,152
She does have a slight
fracture across the tibia

973
01:27:13,229 --> 01:27:14,399
and fibula
of her left leg.

974
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:16,200
She's going to need
a neck brace and a cast,

975
01:27:16,232 --> 01:27:18,282
but otherwise she's fine.

976
01:27:18,818 --> 01:27:20,238
Can I show you something?

977
01:27:20,945 --> 01:27:23,485
Uh, this is
the top vertebrae here.

978
01:27:23,823 --> 01:27:27,163
This dark line, it's hard to see,
but that's the fracture line.

979
01:27:28,411 --> 01:27:30,121
What was she doing
on a roof?

980
01:27:32,665 --> 01:27:34,745
Just playing.

981
01:27:35,710 --> 01:27:37,630
Well, for a girl her age,
she's unusually strong.

982
01:27:38,421 --> 01:27:39,461
Yeah.

983
01:27:39,547 --> 01:27:40,967
There's seven vertebrae
in the neck.

984
01:27:41,049 --> 01:27:44,179
A break to any of the first four,
a tear to the spinal cord...

985
01:27:44,594 --> 01:27:48,014
I mean, if this had happened
just a few millimeters lower,

986
01:27:49,223 --> 01:27:51,773
we'd be talking about
death or paralysis.

987
01:27:54,771 --> 01:27:56,771
You're a very lucky man.

988
01:28:05,573 --> 01:28:07,509
- Hey, guys, come on in.
- Aw, please come in.

989
01:28:07,533 --> 01:28:09,453
- Hi!
- Hi, sweetheart.

990
01:28:09,827 --> 01:28:10,987
Come right in, darling.

991
01:28:11,037 --> 01:28:12,707
Let me have your bag.
Come on, honey.

992
01:28:12,789 --> 01:28:13,959
Slow down, now.

993
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:15,170
Slow down.

994
01:28:15,249 --> 01:28:17,379
Let's go this way, darling.
This way, honey.

995
01:28:17,585 --> 01:28:18,938
We're going to go
right into the kitchen.

996
01:28:18,962 --> 01:28:21,672
Come on, let's get you
something to eat, okay?

997
01:28:21,756 --> 01:28:23,626
You'll have
a good night's sleep.

998
01:28:24,008 --> 01:28:25,088
Okay?

999
01:28:46,072 --> 01:28:47,742
One.
One.

1000
01:28:47,865 --> 01:28:49,615
Two.
Two.

1001
01:28:50,368 --> 01:28:51,868
Three.

1002
01:28:52,537 --> 01:28:53,787
- Four.
- Four.

1003
01:28:53,871 --> 01:28:55,161
And then you go
back, five.

1004
01:28:55,248 --> 01:28:56,418
- Five.
- Like here.

1005
01:28:56,541 --> 01:28:58,001
And you jump up
and clap your hands.

1006
01:28:58,084 --> 01:28:59,594
Six.
Six.

1007
01:29:03,464 --> 01:29:05,025
- Grandfather abuse.
- Grandpa down!

1008
01:29:05,049 --> 01:29:06,889
- Grandfather abuse!
- Grandpa down!

1009
01:29:13,099 --> 01:29:14,639
There's a lot
in here, honey.

1010
01:29:14,726 --> 01:29:16,636
I want you to take
whatever you want.

1011
01:29:18,062 --> 01:29:20,272
There's something
I did want to show you.

1012
01:29:21,774 --> 01:29:24,324
Just before you called
about getting her treatment,

1013
01:29:24,402 --> 01:29:25,782
she sent me two letters.

1014
01:29:25,903 --> 01:29:27,953
And I wanted to
show this one to you.

1015
01:29:32,326 --> 01:29:33,746
"Dear Mom",

1016
01:29:34,787 --> 01:29:36,747
"you don't need to
come get me anymore."

1017
01:29:37,915 --> 01:29:39,625
"Burn the other letter."

1018
01:29:45,256 --> 01:29:47,006
"What Ben and I
have created here"

1019
01:29:47,091 --> 01:29:49,801
"may be unique in all
of human existence."

1020
01:29:51,095 --> 01:29:54,175
"We created a paradise
out of Plato's <i>Republic.</i>"

1021
01:29:55,933 --> 01:29:58,603
"Our children shall
be philosopher kings."

1022
01:30:00,646 --> 01:30:03,776
"It makes me so
indescribably happy."

1023
01:30:05,443 --> 01:30:07,153
"I'm going to get
better out here."

1024
01:30:07,278 --> 01:30:08,528
"I know I will."

1025
01:30:09,155 --> 01:30:11,865
"Because we are defined
by our actions,"

1026
01:30:11,949 --> 01:30:13,659
"not our words."

1027
01:30:40,144 --> 01:30:41,814
Like, not going home?

1028
01:30:45,108 --> 01:30:46,318
Yeah.

1029
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:49,859
Like not going home.

1030
01:30:51,114 --> 01:30:53,164
I am not staying here.

1031
01:30:53,324 --> 01:30:55,744
This house is a vulgar
display of wealth.

1032
01:30:55,827 --> 01:30:58,197
And an unethical use
of space.

1033
01:31:00,665 --> 01:31:02,495
I think you'll
all be safe here.

1034
01:31:02,625 --> 01:31:03,995
But we want to live
with you.

1035
01:31:04,127 --> 01:31:05,877
I almost got
you killed, sweetie.

1036
01:31:06,712 --> 01:31:08,132
It was an accident.

1037
01:31:08,214 --> 01:31:10,014
The tiles just cracked.

1038
01:31:22,687 --> 01:31:26,397
It's a beautiful mistake.

1039
01:31:28,025 --> 01:31:29,525
But a mistake.

1040
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:38,330
I thought it would help her.
I... I thought...

1041
01:31:43,583 --> 01:31:45,753
I thought she'd get better
out there, you know?

1042
01:31:45,877 --> 01:31:47,207
But, uh...

1043
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:54,260
But it was too much.

1044
01:31:55,386 --> 01:31:57,886
It was too much.
Too much, uh...

1045
01:31:59,015 --> 01:32:00,015
And I knew it.

1046
01:32:03,769 --> 01:32:05,019
I did.

1047
01:32:08,608 --> 01:32:09,898
I knew.

1048
01:32:23,748 --> 01:32:25,458
Why can't we just
stay with you?

1049
01:32:29,086 --> 01:32:31,086
Because if you do,

1050
01:32:33,299 --> 01:32:34,929
I'll ruin your lives.

1051
01:32:44,393 --> 01:32:45,943
I'll call you
in a few days.

1052
01:33:12,630 --> 01:33:14,130
You know where
you're heading?

1053
01:33:18,844 --> 01:33:19,974
So?

1054
01:33:39,949 --> 01:33:42,869
I don't know. Maybe you
could take them hunting.

1055
01:33:42,994 --> 01:33:44,084
They...

1056
01:33:44,161 --> 01:33:45,411
They all like that.

1057
01:33:45,496 --> 01:33:47,366
Okay.
And, uh...

1058
01:33:48,374 --> 01:33:50,134
Bo wants to go
to college.

1059
01:33:51,002 --> 01:33:53,212
He got in everywhere.
All the best schools.

1060
01:33:54,839 --> 01:33:56,775
I don't really know how we're
going to pay for all that.

1061
01:33:56,799 --> 01:33:59,509
Ben, I'll take
care of it.

1062
01:34:00,136 --> 01:34:02,006
We're going to look
after your children.

1063
01:34:02,972 --> 01:34:05,852
There's really nothing
to worry about, I promise.

1064
01:34:07,852 --> 01:34:09,812
You're doing
the right thing.

1065
01:34:16,569 --> 01:34:18,359
Okay, well...

1066
01:34:24,410 --> 01:34:25,700
Good luck, Ben.

1067
01:34:26,829 --> 01:34:28,079
Thanks.

1068
01:37:03,736 --> 01:37:05,356
You shaved your face.

1069
01:37:20,586 --> 01:37:22,206
I don't hate you.

1070
01:37:25,883 --> 01:37:27,593
I just wish
you'd helped Mom.

1071
01:37:47,863 --> 01:37:49,243
Me, too.

1072
01:38:01,377 --> 01:38:02,627
I'm sorry.

1073
01:38:04,588 --> 01:38:06,048
I love you.

1074
01:38:17,268 --> 01:38:18,598
We want to complete
the mission.

1075
01:38:19,103 --> 01:38:21,563
No. There's no mission.

1076
01:38:21,647 --> 01:38:24,357
Mission: Rescue Dad
and Mommy.

1077
01:38:24,441 --> 01:38:25,691
Mom wanted
to be cremated.

1078
01:38:25,776 --> 01:38:27,606
And we want to
honor her wishes.

1079
01:38:27,736 --> 01:38:29,236
And flush her down
the toilet.

1080
01:38:30,656 --> 01:38:35,576
I can't put any of you
in danger ever again.

1081
01:38:36,287 --> 01:38:37,747
I'm sorry.

1082
01:38:38,289 --> 01:38:40,369
"If you assume
that there is no hope,"

1083
01:38:40,457 --> 01:38:42,627
"then you guarantee
that there will be no hope."

1084
01:38:43,294 --> 01:38:45,634
"If you assume that there is
an instinct for freedom,"

1085
01:38:46,171 --> 01:38:48,471
"that there are opportunities
to change things,"

1086
01:38:50,301 --> 01:38:52,112
"then there is a possibility
that you can contribute"

1087
01:38:52,136 --> 01:38:53,426
"to making a better world."

1088
01:38:55,764 --> 01:38:57,274
Noam Chomsky.

1089
01:39:33,761 --> 01:39:35,391
Dad, I found her.

1090
01:39:56,533 --> 01:39:58,493
"Leslie Abigail Cash."

1091
01:39:58,827 --> 01:40:02,157
"May God bless her
soul for all eternity."

1092
01:40:02,665 --> 01:40:04,035
Let's dig!

1093
01:40:04,124 --> 01:40:06,844
Otherwise she has to lie
under that bullshit forever.

1094
01:40:36,490 --> 01:40:38,120
Mommy's in here.

1095
01:43:21,822 --> 01:43:23,492
Hi, little bird.

1096
01:43:25,075 --> 01:43:26,405
It's me.

1097
01:43:28,453 --> 01:43:29,793
And I'm sorry.

1098
01:43:30,789 --> 01:43:32,919
I didn't know what to do.

1099
01:43:34,501 --> 01:43:36,751
I'm sorry if
I made it worse.

1100
01:43:47,264 --> 01:43:51,944
My face is mine,
my hands are mine.

1101
01:43:53,604 --> 01:43:57,074
My mouth is mine.

1102
01:44:02,404 --> 01:44:05,494
But I'm not. I'm yours.

1103
01:44:53,872 --> 01:44:55,172
Mom, here's
your favorite song.

1104
01:45:06,718 --> 01:45:11,638
<i>She's got a smile
that it seems to me</i>

1105
01:45:11,723 --> 01:45:15,773
<i>Reminds me of
childhood memories</i>

1106
01:45:15,852 --> 01:45:19,112
<i>Where everything
was as fresh</i>

1107
01:45:19,189 --> 01:45:22,859
<i>As the bright, blue sky</i>

1108
01:45:28,865 --> 01:45:30,115
<i>Now and then</i>

1109
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:32,740
<i>When I see her face</i>

1110
01:45:32,869 --> 01:45:38,129
<i>She takes me away
to that special place</i>

1111
01:45:38,208 --> 01:45:42,088
<i>And if I stare too long</i>

1112
01:45:42,212 --> 01:45:44,922
<i>I'll probably
break down and cry</i>

1113
01:45:50,012 --> 01:45:52,812
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

1114
01:45:52,889 --> 01:45:56,729
<i>Sweet child o' mine</i>

1115
01:46:00,439 --> 01:46:03,069
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

1116
01:46:03,358 --> 01:46:06,278
<i>Sweet love of</i>

1117
01:46:07,237 --> 01:46:08,237
<i>Mine</i>

1118
01:46:15,037 --> 01:46:18,037
<i>She's got eyes
of the bluest skies</i>

1119
01:46:18,123 --> 01:46:22,173
<i>As if they thought of rain</i>

1120
01:46:22,252 --> 01:46:25,842
<i>I'd hate to look
into those eyes</i>

1121
01:46:25,922 --> 01:46:29,092
<i>And see an ounce of pain</i>

1122
01:46:30,302 --> 01:46:33,352
<i>Her hair reminds me
of a warm, safe place</i>

1123
01:46:33,430 --> 01:46:37,350
<i>Where as a child I'd hide</i>

1124
01:46:37,434 --> 01:46:41,234
<i>And pray for the thunder
and the rain</i>

1125
01:46:41,313 --> 01:46:44,443
<i>To quietly pass me by</i>

1126
01:46:45,901 --> 01:46:47,691
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

1127
01:46:47,778 --> 01:46:50,108
<i>Sweet child o' mine</i>

1128
01:46:52,282 --> 01:46:55,742
<i>Say oh, oh, oh</i>

1129
01:47:01,124 --> 01:47:06,004
<i>Sweet child o' mine</i>

1130
01:47:08,381 --> 01:47:13,391
<i>Sweet love o' mine</i>

1131
01:47:16,306 --> 01:47:19,636
<i>Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet</i>

1132
01:47:20,143 --> 01:47:23,563
<i>Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet</i>

1133
01:47:24,106 --> 01:47:28,146
<i>Sweet love o' mine</i>

1134
01:47:31,738 --> 01:47:35,328
<i>Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
Sweet love o' mine</i>

1135
01:47:35,408 --> 01:47:39,248
<i>Sweet, sweet, oh, sweet
Sweet love o' mine</i>

1136
01:47:39,329 --> 01:47:45,419
<i>Sweet, sweet
Sweet love o' mine</i>

1137
01:47:47,003 --> 01:47:50,673
<i>Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
Sweet love o' mine</i>

1138
01:47:50,799 --> 01:47:54,429
<i>Sweet, sweet, oh, sweet
Sweet child o' mine</i>

1139
01:47:54,678 --> 01:47:58,348
<i>Sweet, sweet
Sweet child o' mine</i>

1140
01:48:00,183 --> 01:48:02,273
<i>Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye</i>

1141
01:48:02,435 --> 01:48:06,105
<i>Sweet child, sweet child
Sweet child o' mine</i>

1142
01:48:06,189 --> 01:48:10,029
<i>Sweet child
Oh, sweet</i>

1143
01:48:10,110 --> 01:48:11,860
<i>Sweet child</i>

1144
01:48:12,112 --> 01:48:14,702
<i>Sweet child of mine</i>

1145
01:48:17,534 --> 01:48:19,124
Goodbye, Mommy!

1146
01:48:22,998 --> 01:48:25,498
- I love you all, okay?
- We love you.

1147
01:48:29,379 --> 01:48:31,299
Why are you going
to Namibia?

1148
01:48:31,464 --> 01:48:33,224
I just put my finger
on a map.

1149
01:48:43,518 --> 01:48:48,058
When you have sex with a woman,
be gentle and listen to her.

1150
01:48:50,025 --> 01:48:52,775
Treat her with respect and dignity,
even if you don't love her.

1151
01:48:52,861 --> 01:48:54,321
I know.

1152
01:48:54,404 --> 01:48:55,954
Always tell the truth.

1153
01:48:56,031 --> 01:48:57,951
Always take the high road.

1154
01:48:58,033 --> 01:48:59,493
I know.

1155
01:48:59,576 --> 01:49:01,616
Live each day like
it could be your last.

1156
01:49:02,078 --> 01:49:03,368
Drink it in.

1157
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:07,670
Be adventurous, be bold, but savor it.
It goes fast.

1158
01:49:08,752 --> 01:49:09,962
I know.

1159
01:49:12,547 --> 01:49:13,917
Don't die.

1160
01:49:16,718 --> 01:49:17,928
I won't.

1161
01:49:35,612 --> 01:49:37,162
Get out of here.

1162
01:49:52,712 --> 01:49:54,012
Power to the people.

1163
01:49:54,422 --> 01:49:55,842
Stick it to the man.

1164
01:50:29,124 --> 01:50:30,674
Hey, guys!

1165
01:51:21,468 --> 01:51:22,968
Okay, eat your breakfast.

1166
01:51:23,053 --> 01:51:24,803
The school bus will be
here in 15 minutes.
