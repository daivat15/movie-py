8
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,229
that which also I delivered onto you.

9
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,633
The Lord Jesus, the same night
in which he was betrayed, took bread,

10
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,229
and when he had given thanks,

11
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,751
he broke it and said,

12
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,236
"Take. Eat.

13
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,153
"This is my body,

14
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,152
"which is broken for you,

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,474
"this do in remembrance of me."

16
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,792
And after the same manner
he also took the cup

17
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,797
when he had eaten, saying,

18
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,190
"This cup is the new covenant
in my blood.

19
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,551
"This, oft as you drink it,
in remembrance of me,

20
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,149
"or as often as you eat this bread

21
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,272
"and drink this wine,

22
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,279
"you do shew the Lord's death

23
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,152
"till he comes again."

24
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,519
Will you send a dinghy, please?

25
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,311
'Did you hear me?
I'd like a dinghy, if you please.'

26
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,558
Hello, sir!
Have you lost your bearings?

27
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,956
'No, sir, I don't think so.

28
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,869
- 'This is Summerisle, is it not?'
- It is, sir!

29
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,913
'I'm right then.
Now, would you send a dinghy, please?'

30
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,796
I'm afraid it can't be done, sir!
This is private property!

31
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,754
You can't land here
without written permission!

32
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,672
'I, as you can see, am a police officer.

33
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,911
'A complaint has been registered

34
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,317
'by a resident of this island
about a missing child.

35
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,354
'Now, that makes it a police matter,
private property or not.

36
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,949
'Now, will you send a dinghy, please?'

37
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,037
Need to tell his lordship, aye.

38
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,313
Good day to you, sir.
I'm the harbour master.

39
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,630
Sergeant Howie, West Highland police.

40
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,274
A missing child is always trouble.

41
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,358
Aye, aye, aye, for everybody.

42
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,632
Perhaps you would be good enough
to explain matters to his lordship.

43
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,956
He's most particular who lands here.

44
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,750
All in good time.
We, too, have our own particularities.

45
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,077
You know her?
Her name is Rowan Morrison.

46
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,029
The photo was in this letter,
posted here on Summerisle.

47
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,515
No, no, never seen her before.

48
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,996
I don't know the face either.
Do you know her, Kenny?

49
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,396
She doesn't belong to this island.

50
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,909
No, I never saw her before.

51
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,158
No, she doesn't belong here at all.
Johnnie?

52
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,112
The letter is anonymous.

53
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,596
It was addressed to me personally
on the mainland.

54
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,075
No, cannae say I know her.

55
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,194
Now, now, what are you saying?
You're saying she's not from the island?

56
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,391
That's right. She's not from here.

57
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,150
You get Morrisons on Lewis
and a few on Mull. I would try there.

58
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,714
Thanks.

59
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,117
"None of us has seen May Morrison's
daughter Rowan since last year.

60
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,359
"She's only 12, and she's been missing
from her home for many months."

61
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,471
The mother's name is May Morrison.

62
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,355
Oh, May!
She quite slipped my memory.

63
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,871
Of course we've got May. She keeps
the post office in the high street.

64
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,038
- May Morrison? You're quite sure?
- Quite sure.

65
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,549
Well, thank you for your help.

66
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,918
That's not May's daughter, though!

67
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,235
No, she's not May's.

68
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,476
Then who is she?

69
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,999
- Good afternoon.
- I like your rabbits.

70
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,192
Those are hares,
not silly old rabbits.

71
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,473
Lovely March hares.
Can I help you?

72
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,830
- Mrs Morrison? Mrs May Morrison?
- Yes.

73
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,794
- Sergeant Howie, West Highland police.
- Oh, my!

74
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,072
Did you come over in that aeroplane
that I saw flying round?

75
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,596
- Aye, that's right.
- What, just to see me?

76
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,633
Well, no, not exactly. Erm...

77
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,640
I'm making inquiries about your daughter.
We understand that she's missing.

78
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,876
Missing? My daughter?

79
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,352
- Aye. You do have a daughter?
- Yes.

80
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,997
- And that's her?
- Oh, never.

81
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,596
I tell you no.

82
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,749
I think you'd better come with me.

83
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,193
This is our Myrtle.
She was nine last Thursday.

84
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,954
She's not a bit like the girl
in your photograph.

85
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,959
She must be
at least 13 or 14, surely.

86
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,469
Myrtle, say hello.

87
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,069
- This is Sergeant... Oh!
- Howie.

88
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,077
- Oh.
- Hello, Myrtle.

89
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,759
How do you do?

90
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,753
- Look, Mummy, I'm drawing a hare.
- Ah.

91
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,110
Excuse me, Sergeant.

92
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,793
Hello.

93
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,757
Here you are,
you can fill in the ears in grey.

94
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,279
Oh, sorry.

95
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,031
Thank you, Myrtle.

96
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,717
Myrtle, do you, erm...
do you know Rowan?

97
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,672
Course I do.

98
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,477
- You do?
- Course I do, silly.

99
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,151
- Uh, do you know where she is now?
- In the fields.

100
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,351
She runs and plays there all day.

101
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,393
Does she? Do you think
she'll be coming back for tea?

102
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,712
Tea? Hares don't have tea, silly.

103
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,273
Hares?

104
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,593
She's a hare. Rowan's a hare.
She has a lovely time.

105
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,151
- Well, tell me...
- Well, now, Sergeant.

106
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,999
You will stay and have a cup of tea,
won't you?

107
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,754
- Oh, well, yes, yes, please.
- Good.

108
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,632
- That's very kind of you.
- Not at all.

109
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,229
It must be thirsty work,
asking all those questions, eh?

110
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,589
Aye.

111
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,791
- Hello. Evening.
- Evening.

112
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,715
- Evening.
- Hello again.

113
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,915
- Are you the landlord here?
- Aye. I'm Alder MacGreagor.

114
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,509
And you must be the policeman
from the mainland.

115
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,393
Aye, that's right. Sergeant Howie,
West Highland constabulary.

116
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,478
I'm quite obviously not going
to get back to the mainland tonight,

117
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,830
so I wondered if you had a room
and a bite of supper I could have.

118
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,118
- Could you manage that?
- Aye, I think that can be arranged.

119
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,471
My daughter Willow will show you
to your room.

120
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,070
- Willow!
- Father?

121
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,716
This is Sergeant Howie,
a policeman from the mainland,

122
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,116
who will be spending the night with us.

123
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,199
- This is my daughter, Willow.
- Good evening.

124
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,311
Show the Sergeant to his room,
would you?

125
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,912
- I'd like my supper now, please.
- It won't be long, Sergeant.

126
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,554
Och, you don't want to let them
worry you.

127
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,830
Why don't you have a wee drink?

128
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,236
No, thank you, not just now.

129
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,431
I think you all ought to know that
I am here on official business.

130
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,913
I am here to investigate
the disappearance of a young girl...

131
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,919
...as doubtless, the harbour master
has already told you by now.

132
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,999
There's the girl.
Her name is Rowan Morrison.

133
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,795
Would you pass that
among your customers, please?

134
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,276
Now, if any of you can give me
any idea as to her whereabouts,

135
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,153
I'd be most grateful
if you'd let me know.

136
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,559
No, I've not seen her.
Have you tried the mainland?

137
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,151
No, I've not see her.
I've not seen her at all.

138
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,592
No, I'm afraid
nobody's seen her, Sergeant.

139
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,556
Thank you. Are these
harvest festival photographs?

140
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,069
Aye, we have one taken
at the end of every summer.

141
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,034
- What happened to last year's?
- It got broke.

142
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,276
Your supper's ready, Sergeant.

143
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,040
Willow, show the Sergeant
to the dining room.

144
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,113
Thank you.

145
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,399
It's disgusting.

146
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,270
- Thank you.
- What's the matter, aren't you hungry?

147
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,311
Aye, it's just most of the food I've had,

148
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,514
the farmhouse soup, the potatoes,
broad beans, all come out of a can.

149
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,550
Broad beans, in their natural state,
aren't usually turquoise, are they?

150
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,833
Some things in their natural state
have the most vivid colours.

151
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,874
I-I-l...just wanted to know why,
that's all.

152
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,277
Now, I wonder what
you'll be wanting for afters?

153
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,472
- I'll have an apple.
- No apples.

154
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,475
No apples? On an island famous
for its fruit and vegetables?

155
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,989
I expect they've all been exported.

156
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,475
You can have peaches and cream,
if you like.

157
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,319
Aye, from a can, I suppose.

158
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,113
All right.

159
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,470
Cheer up.
Food isn't everything in life, you know.

160
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,956
up, up,	up,
	
161
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,277
up, up, up! up! up!

162
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,075
Where?

163
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,511
You'll find it at the top of the stair
on your right.

164
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,513
Willow MacGreagor, I have the honour
to present to you Ash Buchanan.

165
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,629
Come up, Ash Buchanan.

166
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,471
Another sacrifice for Aphrodite, Willow.

167
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,750
You flatter me, your lordship.

168
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,269
Surely you mean to Aphrodite?

169
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,549
I make no such distinction.

170
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,240
You are the Goddess of Love
in human form

171
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,873
and I am merely your humble acolyte.

172
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,719
Enjoy yourself... and him.

173
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,912
Only, make sure you are ready
for tomorrow's tomorrow.

174
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,635
The day of
death and rebirth.

175
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,510
Yes.

176
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,395
And of a somewhat more
serious offering.

177
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,473
I think I could turn
and live with animals.

178
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,718
They are so placid and self-contained.

179
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,833
They do not lie awake in the dark
and weep for their sins.

180
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,670
They do not make me sick,
discussing their duty to God.

181
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,710
Not one of them kneels to another,

182
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,071
or to his own kind
that lived thousands of years ago.

183
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,833
Not one of them is 'respectable'...

184
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,600
or 'unhappy'...

185
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,040
all over the earth.

186
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,432
Good morning, Sergeant.

187
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,552
- Morning.
- Isn't it glorious?

188
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,796
Aye, aye, it's very nice.

189
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,434
I expect you'll be going home tonight?

190
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,513
Well, that depends.

191
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,877
Where's the school, please?

192
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,310
On the far side of the green.

193
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,556
Thank you.

194
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,990
Very well, girls. That's enough.
Now it's time to pay attention to me.

195
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,358
Now, uh, Daisy,

196
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,951
will you tell us what it is, please,
that the Maypole represents?

197
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,634
Really, Daisy.
You've been told often enough.

198
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,434
- Miss Rose, I know!
- I know!

199
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,200
- All right, then, anybody.
- Phallic symbol.

200
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,399
The phallic symbol.
That is correct.

201
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,796
It is the image of the penis,

202
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,072
which is venerated in religions
such as ours

203
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,591
as symbolising
the generative force in nature.

204
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,910
Oh, can I help you?

205
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,960
C-could I have a word with you,
please, Miss?

206
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,233
Certainly. Girls, open your desks
and take out your exercise books.

207
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,917
Miss, you can be quite sure that I shall
report this to the proper authorities.

208
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,554
Everywhere I go on this island,
it seems to me I find degeneracy.

209
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,072
And there is brawling in bars,
there is indecency in public places,

210
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,113
and there is corruption of the young,
and now I see it all stems from here.

211
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,635
It stems from the filth taught here
in this very schoolroom.

212
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,879
I was unaware that the police had
any authority in matters of education.

213
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,470
Aye, aye, well,
we'll see about that.

214
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,275
Girls, could I have your attention,
please?

215
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,073
Now, I am a police officer.

216
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,437
Well, as you can see.

217
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,949
I have come here from the mainland

218
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,835
to investigate
the disappearance of a young girl.

219
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,554
I have a photograph here...
Excuse me.

220
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,913
...which I would like you
to pass around amongst yourselves.

221
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,874
Meanwhile, I'll write her name over there
on the blackboard.

222
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,957
Rowan Morrison.

223
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,357
That's her name.

224
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,070
Now, do any of you recognise
either the name or the photograph?

225
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,840
- No.
- There's your answer, Sergeant.

226
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,157
If she existed, we would know her.

227
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,160
- Whose desk is that?
- No one's.

228
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,874
Thank you.

229
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,034
The little old beetle goes round and
round, always the same way, you see,

230
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,199
till he ends up right up tight
to the nail, poor old thing.

231
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,713
"Poor old thing"?

232
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,510
Then why in God's name
do you do it, girl?

233
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,078
I'd like to see the school register,
please.

234
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,840
I'm afraid you'll have to have
Lord Summerisle's authority.

235
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,712
This is a police matter.

236
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,070
I'm afraid you'll have to have
a search warrant or permission

237
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,714
from Lord Summerisle himself.

238
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,878
I'm afraid you'll just have
to bear with me, won't you?

239
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,075
You're liars.
You are despicable little liars.

240
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,080
Rowan Morrison is
a schoolmate of yours, isn't she?

241
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,715
And that is her desk, isn't it?

242
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,400
- Well, isn't it?
- I think you ought to know...

243
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,029
And you are the biggest liar of all!

244
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,754
I warn you,
one more lie out of you,

245
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,589
and I will charge you with obstruction.

246
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,553
And, believe me, Miss Rose,
that is a promise.

247
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,239
Now...

248
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,152
...for the last time,

249
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,999
where is Rowan Morrison?

250
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,191
I would like to speak
to you outside, Sergeant.

251
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,470
Girls, get on with your reading.

252
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:45,197
It's the "Rites and Rituals of May Day",
chapter five. I won't be long.

253
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,039
Well?

254
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:56,474
You don't understand, Sergeant.
Nobody was lying. I told you plainly.

255
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,797
If Rowan Morrison existed,
we would know of her.

256
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,390
You mean, she doesn't exist?
She's dead?

257
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,637
- You would say so.
- Oh, come on, come on.

258
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,354
She's either dead, or she's not dead.

259
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,677
Here, we do not use the word...

260
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,872
We believe that
when the human life is over,

261
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,880
the soul returns to trees, to air,

262
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,038
to fire, to water, to animals.

263
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,513
So that Rowan Morrison
has simply returned

264
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,149
to the life forces in another form.

265
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,513
Do you mean to say
you teach the children this stuff?

266
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:44,840
Yes. I told you,
it is what we believe.

267
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,395
They never learn anything
of Christianity?

268
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,194
Only as a comparative religion.

269
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,199
The children find it
far easier to picture

270
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,199
reincarnation than resurrection.

271
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,718
Those rotting bodies
are a great stumbling block

272
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,514
for the childish imagination.

273
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,119
Why, of course.

274
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,072
And may I ask,

275
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,158
where is the rotting body
of Rowan Morrison?

276
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,432
Right where you'd expect it to be,
in the earth.

277
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,030
You mean, in the churchyard?

278
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,949
- In a manner of speaking...
- No! In plain speaking.

279
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,870
The building attached to the ground
in which the body lies

280
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,152
is no longer used
for Christian worship,

281
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,279
so whether it is still a churchyard
is debatable.

282
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,313
But forgive me. I must get back
to my girls. Good morning to you.

283
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,513
"Here lieth Beech Buchanan,

284
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,599
"protected by
the ejaculation of serpents"?

285
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,071
- Morning.
- Morning.

286
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,079
I see you plant trees
on most of the graves here.

287
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,716
- Aye, that's right.
- What tree is that?

288
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,036
That's a rowan.

289
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,629
- And who lies there?
- Rowan Morrison.

290
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,437
- How long has she been dead?
- Oh, six or seven months.

291
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,951
They're just a wee bit late
with the headstone.

292
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,350
What on earth's that?
It looks like a piece of skin.

293
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,598
- Why, so it is.
- Well, what is it?

294
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,037
The poor wee lassie's navel string,
of course.

295
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,472
Where else should it be
but hung on her own little tree?

296
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,110
Where does your minister live?

297
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,799
Minister?

298
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,118
"Minister"!

299
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,077
What a silly girl you are to make
all this fuss. It's just a little frog.

300
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,517
It'll do that poor sore throat good.

301
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,631
Anyone'd think you didn't
want to get better.

302
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,229
Now, in he goes!

303
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:35,517
And out he comes. There.
Now, that didn't hurt much, did it?

304
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,712
- it tasted horrid.
- Never mind, darling. It's all over now.

305
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,310
Here's your sweet for being a brave girl.
Which one would you like?

306
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,719
There. He's got your horrid old sore
throat now, hasn't he, poor creature?

307
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,797
Can't you hear him croaking?

308
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,395
Can I do anything for you, Sergeant?

309
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,115
I doubt it,
seeing you're all raving mad.

310
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,477
Good day.

311
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,433
I'd like to see
your index of deaths, please.

312
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,597
Do you have authority?

313
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,069
No, I meant from his lordship.

314
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,395
I don't need it.

315
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,235
I'm afraid you have to get permission
from Lord Summerisle.

316
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,471
Miss...

317
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,797
If you don't cooperate with me
here and now,

318
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,879
you may well find yourself inside
a police cell on the mainland tonight!

319
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,798
Have I made myself quite clear?

320
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,637
Please.

321
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,233
Thank you.

322
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,510
M, M, M, M...

323
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,593
"Benjamin and Rachel Morrison."

324
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,791
Rachel and Benjamin...

325
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,830
- Names from the Bible.
- Yes. They were very old.

326
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,150
But there's no record
of Rowan Morrison's death,

327
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,438
which means, of course,
there is no death certificate.

328
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,678
- Did you know her?
- Yes, of course.

329
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,434
- Is that her?
- Yes, that's her.

330
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,389
How did she die?

331
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,310
I don't know. I don't know
anything about her. Nothing.

332
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,560
Thank you.

333
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,750
Are you Mr Lennox,
the photographer?

334
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,874
Oh, I'm firstly a chemist,
secondly a photographer.

335
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,833
I understand you take the harvest
festival photographs every year.

336
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,554
- The ones I saw in The Green Man.
- Yes.

337
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,671
It's rather humdrum work, I'm afraid.

338
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,155
What happened
to last year's photograph?

339
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,396
Isn't it there with the others?

340
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,876
No, no, it's not. Apparently it's been
broken or damaged in some way.

341
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,994
- Oh, what a pity.
- Would you have a copy of it?

342
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,999
Oh, no, I don't keep copies.

343
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:35,318
Mr Lennox, you were among the people
to whom I showed the photograph

344
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,630
in the Green Man.

345
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,229
Is that the girl?

346
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,711
- It's difficult to say.
- Oh, come on, man!

347
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,676
It was only eight months ago. Surely
you remember if it was that girl or not.

348
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,479
Thank you.

349
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,874
- His lordship is expecting you, sir.
- Expecting me?

350
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,789
That's what his lordship told me, sir.
Would you please come this way?

351
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,999
In there, sir.

352
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,555
Good afternoon, Sergeant Howie.

353
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,718
I trust the sight of the young people
refreshes you.

354
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,071
No, sir, it does not refresh me.

355
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,157
Oh, I'm sorry.

356
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,511
One should always be open
to the regenerative influences.

357
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,520
I understand you're looking
for a missing girl.

358
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,517
- I've found her.
- Splendid.

359
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,196
In her grave. Your lordship is
a justice of the peace.

360
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,118
I need your permission
to exhume her body,

361
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,516
have it transported to the mainland
for a pathologist's report.

362
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,473
You suspect...foul play?

363
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,513
I suspect murder
and conspiracy to murder.

364
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,200
In that case, you must go ahead.

365
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,079
Your lordship seems
strangely unconcerned.

366
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,834
I'm confident your suspicions
are wrong, Sergeant.

367
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,511
We don't commit murder up here.
We're a deeply religious people.

368
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,475
Religious?

369
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,355
With ruined churches,
no ministers, no priests,

370
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,710
and children dancing naked!

371
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,271
They do love
their divinity lessons.

372
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,916
But t-they are...are naked.

373
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,713
Naturally. It's much too dangerous

374
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,753
to jump through the fire
with your clothes on.

375
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,549
Wh-what religion c-c-can
they possibly be learning,

376
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,830
jumping over bonfires?

377
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,633
Parthenogenesis.

378
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,280
What?

379
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,878
Literally, as Miss Rose would
doubtless say in her assiduous way,

380
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,192
reproduction without sexual union.

381
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,596
Oh, what is all this?

382
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:15,998
I mean, y-y-you've got
f-f-fake biology, fake religion.

383
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,272
Sir, have these children
never heard of Jesus?

384
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:26,472
Himself the son of a virgin,
impregnated, I believe, by a ghost.

385
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,878
Do sit down, Sergeant.

386
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,153
Shocks are so much better absorbed
with the knees bent.

387
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,640
Please.

388
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,115
Now, those children out there,

389
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,516
they're jumping through the flames

390
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,553
in the hope that the god of fire
will make them fruitful.

391
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,512
Really, you can hardly blame them.

392
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,154
After all, what girl would not prefer
the child of a god

393
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,557
to that of some acne-scarred artisan?

394
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,354
- And you encourage them in this?
- Actively.

395
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,199
It's most important that each
new generation born on Summerisle

396
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,551
be made aware that
here the old gods aren't dead.

397
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,796
But what of the true god

398
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,036
to whose glory churches
and monasteries have been built

399
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,549
on these islands for generations past?

400
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,830
Now, sir, what of him?

401
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,998
He's dead. He can't complain.

402
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,909
He had his chance,
and in the modern parlance, he blew it.

403
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,198
- What?
- It's very simple. Let me show you.

404
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,676
In the last century,
the islanders were starving.

405
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,593
Like our neighbours today,
they were scratching a bare subsistence

406
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,071
from sheep and sea.

407
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,354
Then in 1868, my grandfather
bought this barren island

408
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,630
and began to change things.

409
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,913
A distinguished Victorian scientist,
agronomist, free thinker.

410
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,753
How formidably benevolent he seems.

411
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,999
Essentially the face of a man
incredulous of all human good.

412
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,509
You're very cynical, my lord.

413
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,596
What attracted my grandfather
to the island,

414
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:11,714
apart from the profuse source
of wiry labour that it promised,

415
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,593
was the unique combination
of volcanic soil

416
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,633
and the warm Gulf Stream
that surrounded it.

417
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,791
You see, his experiments
had led him to believe

418
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,389
that it was possible to induce here
the successful growth

419
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,433
of certain new strains of fruit
that he had developed.

420
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,793
So, with typical mid-Victorian zeal,
he set to work.

421
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,560
The best way of accomplishing this,
so it seemed to him,

422
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,115
was to rouse the people
from their apathy

423
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,312
by giving them back
their joyous old gods,

424
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,272
and as a result of this worship,

425
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,553
the barren island would burgeon
and bring forth fruit in great abundance.

426
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,911
What he did, of course, was to develop
new cultivars of hardy fruits

427
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,117
suited to local conditions.

428
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,639
But, of course, to begin with,

429
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,876
they worked for him
because he fed them and clothed them,

430
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:57,954
but later, when the trees starting fruiting,
it became a very different matter.

431
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,913
And the ministers fled the island,
never to return.

432
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,759
What my grandfather
had started out of expediency,

433
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,793
my father continued out of...love.

434
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,077
He brought me up the same way,

435
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:15,036
to reverence the music and the drama
and the rituals of the old gods.

436
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,272
To love nature and to fear it,

437
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,478
and to rely on it and to appease it
where necessary.

438
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,911
- He brought me up...
- He brought you up to be a pagan!

439
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:32,753
A heathen, conceivably,
but not, I hope, an unenlightened one.

440
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,875
Lord Summerisle, I am interested
in one thing: the law.

441
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,356
But I must remind you, sir,
that despite everything you've said,

442
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,677
you are the subject
of a Christian country.

443
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:54,557
Now, sir, if I may have your permission
to exhume the body of Rowan Morrison.

444
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,672
I was under the impression
I'd already given it to you.

445
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,871
Ah, there's your transport.

446
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,311
It's been a great pleasure
meeting a Christian copper.

447
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:24,274
I found that
in Rowan Morrison's grave.

448
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,712
Little Rowan loved the March hares.

449
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,319
Hmm.

450
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,714
It's sacrilege!

451
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:41,074
Only if the ground is consecrated
to the Christian belief.

452
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:46,195
Personally, I think it makes
a very lovely transmutation.

453
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,234
I'm sure Rowan is most happy with it.
Do you not think so, Lord Summerisle?

454
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:54,991
Miss, I hope you don't think that
I can be made a fool of indefinitely.

455
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,396
Where is Rowan Morrison?

456
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,997
Why, here she is,
what remains of her physically.

457
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,152
Her soul, of course, may even now...

458
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,516
Lord Summerisle!

459
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,712
Where is Rowan Morrison?

460
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,837
Sergeant Howie, I think that...

461
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,999
you are supposed to be
the detective here.

462
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:31,790
A child is reported missing
on your island.

463
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,476
At first,
I'm told there is no such child.

464
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:41,873
I then find that there is, in fact,
but that she has been killed.

465
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,517
I subsequently discover that
there is no death certificate.

466
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,792
And now I find
that there is a grave.

467
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,391
There's no body.

468
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,990
Very perplexing for you.

469
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,434
What do you think could've happened?

470
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:10,198
I think Rowan Morrison
was murdered

471
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:14,200
under circumstances
of pagan barbarity,

472
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,630
which I can scarcely bring
myself to believe

473
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,434
as taking place in the 20th century.

474
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,477
Now, it is my intention tomorrow
to return to the mainland

475
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,069
and report my suspicions
to the Chief Constable

476
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,874
of the West Highland constabulary.

477
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,719
And I will demand
a full inquiry takes place

478
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,992
into the affairs of this heathen island.

479
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,994
You must, of course,
do as you see fit, Sergeant.

480
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,919
Perhaps it's just as well that
you won't be here tomorrow,

481
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:51,398
to be offended by the sight
of our May Day celebrations here.

482
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,870
Broome, would you kindly
show the Sergeant out?

483
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,037
- This way, sir.
- Goodbye.

484
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,313
There's hardly any produce.

485
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,795
Well, that's it, the crops failed.

486
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:34,473
And it's Rowan.
Rowan and the crops failed!

487
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,079
Sacrifice.

488
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,559
'Perhaps it's just as well
that you won't be here

489
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,799
'to be offended by the sight
of our May Day celebrations tomorrow.'

490
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,270
Sergeant?

491
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,910
Wake up, Sergeant.

492
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,839
- What time is it?
- It's past nine.

493
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,793
I thought you were gonna
come and see me last night.

494
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,671
I invited you.

495
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,791
I'm engaged to be married.

496
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,560
Does that stop you?

497
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,560
Ave. Aye.

498
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,433
I must say,
you are a gallant fellow, Sergeant.

499
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,877
It's nothing personal.

500
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,637
Just that I don't believe in it.

501
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,273
Before marriage.

502
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,118
Suit yourself.

503
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,880
I expect you'll be going back today.

504
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,992
You don't want to be around here
on May Day.

505
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,396
Not the way you feel.

506
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:06,515
We carry death out of the village!

507
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,190
We carry death
out of the village!

508
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:14,319
We carry death out of the village!

509
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,158
We carry death...

510

"Sometimes the victim

544
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,551
Good morning, Sergeant!

545
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,873
I need to get to my plane.

546
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:29,749
Oh, well, on May Day,
I'd better take you out myself.

547
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,393
That's it.

548
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,233
Here, right.

549
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,072
I shall be back shortly
with some more police officers.

550
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,038
Have a good flight, then!

551
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,434
Hey, you come back here!

552
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,632
I said, come back here!

553
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,790
What's the matter? Won't she go?

554
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:59,078
No. Has anyone been here?

555
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,157
Not to my knowledge, Sergeant.

556
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,079
If any of the children had been
interfering with it,

557
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,793
I'm sure I would've seen them.

558
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,594
I warn you,
you're obstructing a police officer.

559
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,190
I am not obstructing you, Sergeant.

560
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:16,109
You could maybe get old Sam there
to row you to the mainland.

561
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,675
You'd be back in a week.

562
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:26,154
Well, I'll just have to find
Rowan Morrison myself.

563
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,517
- Everything under control, Oak?
- Aye, my lord.

564
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,110
Mr MacGreagor,

565
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,318
I trust we aren't going to have
to let out your costume again this year.

566
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:56,231
I think I'll manage, my lord, but it does
seem to shrink a little each year.

567
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,431
My friends, enough now.

568
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:15,680
We shall all reassemble
outside the town hall at 3:00 sharp,

569
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:19,031
and then process through the village
and the countryside,

570
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,390
down to the beach
below the stones,

571
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:24,433
by the route which has become
sacred to our rite.

572
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:28,440
This year at the procession's end,
as has already been proclaimed,

573
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:32,440
a holy sacrifice will be offered up
jointly to Nuada,

574
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,710
our most sacred god of the sun,

575
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:38,356
and to Avellenau,
the beloved goddess of our orchards,

576
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:42,713
in order that we may furnish them
with renewed power

577
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,349
to quicken the growth of our crops.

578
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:49,394
- Hail the Queen of the May!
- Hail the Queen of the May!

579
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,160
Hail the Queen of the May!

580
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,999
Why, Sergeant,
I thought you'd gone back.

581
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:05,193
Mrs Morrison, I don't know
if you know it or not,

582
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:08,318
but Rowan is not dead,
they've got her hidden somewhere.

583
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,919
They?

584
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:13,829
If you know where she is, I beg you
to tell me now before it's too late.

585
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,474
- Sergeant, I've already told you...
- In the name of God, woman!

586
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,352
What kind of mother are you,

587
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,517
that can stand by and see
your own child slaughtered?

588
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,951
Sergeant, if I were you,
I would go back to the mainland.

589
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:27,152
Stop interfering in things
that are no concern of yours.

590
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,989
I am going to search every house
in this place during the next few hours,

591
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:34,033
and if anybody, including you,
stands in my way,

592
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,913
they'll be arrested
as accomplices to murder.

593
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,999
You'll simply never understand
the true nature of sacrifice.

594
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,271
Heathens! Bloody heathens!

595
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:51,632
- Yes?
- Take those masks off!

596
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,910
- No.
- Take them off!

597
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,312
- What do you think you're doing?
- Searching every house

598
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,750
for a missing child.

599
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:47,153
I-I'm sorry.

600
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,555
- What's that?
- The life of the fields.

601
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,074
John Barleycorn.

602
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,316
What's in here?

603
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,151
- What's that?
- That's my costume.

604
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,596
The salmon of knowledge.

605
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:45,591
Hello. You're back early.

606
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:48,234
Where are the other coppers?

607
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:51,671
There aren't any.
The plane wouldn't start.

608
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:57,517
Give me a glass of whiskey, please.

609
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:01,759
So he spent his time instead
turning the whole village upside down.

610
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:06,431
- Just give me a glass of whiskey!
- No wonder he's worn out.

611
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,591
Did you find the girl?

612
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:12,439
No, well, I can't say
I'm very surprised.

613
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:16,395
I'm going to rest in my bed
for half an hour.

614
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,670
I do not wish to be disturbed.

615
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,519
I'd stay there until tonight,
if I was you!

616
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,712
We don't much relish strangers
around today!

617
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:35,194
He's asleep.

618
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,709
I don't like to use it on him, really.

619
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,599
The laird said we're to take
no chances, didn't he?

620
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:44,515
I know, but with the Hand of Glory
there's no telling when you wake.

621
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:46,876
- He might sleep for days.
- All the better.

622
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,274
Shh!

623
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:52,155
We don't want him butting in.
Go on, light it up.

624
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:17,990
That'll make you sleep,
my pretty Sergeant.

625
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:27,269
I'm away to change.
We can't do without Punch.

626
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,877
You best get on ahead.

627
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,469
They've given you girls
five minutes start, haven't they?

628
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:34,749
Good bye.

629
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:57,474
What's the matter with you,
MacGreagor? You call that dancing?

630
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,877
Cut some capers, man.
Use your bladder!

631
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,640
Play the fool.
That's what you're here for.

632
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,317
I suppose you've been getting drunk
at your own bar.

633
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,358
That's more like it!

634
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,439
Good, good!

635
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,798
- Chop!
- Chop! Chop! Chop!

636
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:02,356
Chop! Chop! Chop!

637
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,914
Everyone must go through,
MacGreagor.

638
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,111
It's a game of chance, remember.

639
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,513
Chop! Chop! Chop!

640
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:07,877
It's Holly. Well done!

641
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,310
It's wee Holly.

642
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:18,552
- Now, my friends, to the beach.
- To the beach!

643
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:40,193
O god of the sea,
I offer you this ale as a libation,

644
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:44,757
that you may bestow upon us
in the year to come

645
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:49,192
the rich and diverse fruits
of your kingdom.

646
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,758
Hail, god of the seas!

647
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,712
Accept our offering!

648
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:12,317
And now,
for our more dreadful sacrifice

649
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:15,592
for those who command
the fruit of the Earth.

650
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,269
It's Rowan.

651
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,873
What's the matter, Mr MacGreagor?

652
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,957
Now, don't be frightened.
I'm a police officer.

653
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,674
- I've got to try and get you away.
- Hurry, please.

654
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,430
I don't like it here. They're coming.
You know what they're going to do?

655
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:47,916
I know what they're going to do.
Come on, come on. Hurry, hurry!

656
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,635
We can escape through the cave.
I know the way.

657
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:59,554
Quickly.

658
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,953
That's the way out, up there.

659
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:29,396
Come on. It's through a big tunnel.

660
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,795
We seem to have lost
our torch-bearing friends.

661
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,355
I'm sorry. It was worse
than I remembered it.

662
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:05,836
- Did I do it right?
- You did it beautifully.

663
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:07,473
Dear little Rowan.

664
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:20,439
Rowan, darling! Come on, now.

665
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:47,558
Welcome, fool.

666
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:52,280
You have come of your own free will
to the appointed place.

667
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,876
The game's over.

668
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:58,919
Game? What game?

669
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:02,192
The game of the hunted
leading the hunter.

670
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:05,233
You came here
to find Rowan Morrison,

671
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:08,990
but it is we who have found you
and brought you here,

672
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:13,000
and controlled your every thought
and action since you arrived.

673
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,516
Principally,
we persuaded you to think

674
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:19,280
that Rowan Morrison
was being held as a sacrifice

675
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:22,080
because our crops failed last year.

676
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,714
I know your crops failed.
I saw the harvest photograph.

677
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:28,834
Oh, yes. They failed, all right.
Disastrously so.

678
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:32,316
For the first time
since my grandfather came here.

679
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:37,354
The blossom came, but the fruit
withered and died on the bough.

680
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:41,553
That must not happen again this year.

681
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:45,310
It is our most earnest belief that
the best way of preventing this

682
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,956
is to offer to our god of the sun
and to the goddess of our orchards

683
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:53,233
the most acceptable sacrifice
that lies in our power.

684
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:58,115
Animals are fine,
but their acceptability is limited.

685
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:02,234
A little child is even better,
but not nearly as effective

686
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,869
as the right kind of adult.

687
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:10,439
What do you mean,
"right kind of adult"?

688
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:18,349
You, Sergeant,
are the right kind of adult,

689
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,916
as our painstaking researches
have revealed.

690
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:26,273
You, uniquely,
were the one we needed.

691
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,596
A man who would come here
of his own free will.

692
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,400
A man who has come here
with the power of a king

693
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,511
by representing the law.

694
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:36,115
A man who would come here
as a virgin.

695
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:39,198
A man who has come here
as a fool.

696
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,396
Get out of my way.

697
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:12,995
You are the fool, Mr Howie.

698
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:18,479
Punch, one of the great
fool-victims of history.

699
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:23,838
For you have accepted
the role of king for a day,

700
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:26,713
and who but a fool would do that?

701
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:32,432
But you will be revered
and anointed as a king.

702
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,836
You will undergo death and rebirth,

703
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,957
resurrection, if you like.

704
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,355
The rebirth, sadly, will not be yours,

705
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:51,869
but that of our crops.

706
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,038
I am a Christian,

707
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:58,073
and as a Christian,
I hope for resurrection.

708
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:02,679
And even if you kill me now,

709
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:07,874
it is I who will live again,
not your damned apples.

710
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:27,159
No matter what you do,

711
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:30,113
you can't change the fact

712
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,550
that I believe in the life eternal,

713
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:35,274
as promised to us
by Our Lord, Jesus Christ.

714
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:42,552
as promised to us
by Our Lord, Jesus Christ!

715
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:47,916
That is good,
for believing what you do,

716
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:53,200
we confer upon you
a rare gift these days,

717
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:55,470
a martyr's death.

718
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:58,877
You will not only have life eternal,

719
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,516
but you will sit with the saints
among the elect.

720
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:04,989
Come.

721
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:09,751
It is time to keep your appointment
with The Wicker Man.

722
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,718
Now, wait!

723
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:16,993
Now, all of you,
just wait and listen to me.

724
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:22,320
And you can wrap it up any way you like.
You are about to commit murder.

725
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:26,673
Can you not see?
There is no sun god.

726
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:30,509
There is no goddess of the fields.

727
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:38,229
Your crops failed
because your strains failed.

728
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:43,230
Fruit is not meant to be grown
on these islands. It's against nature.

729
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:47,558
Don't you see that killing me is not
going to bring back your apples?

730
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:51,479
Summerisle, you know it won't.

731
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:54,513
Go on, man.
Tell them. Tell them it won't!

732
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:56,438
I know it will.

733
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:01,680
Well, don't you understand that
if your crops fail this year,

734
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:05,555
next year you're going to have
to have another blood sacrifice?

735
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:09,560
And next year, no one less than
the king of Summerisle himself will do.

736
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:11,796
If the crops fail, Summerisle,

737
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:16,670
next year your people will kill you
on May Day.

738
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:19,559
They will not fail.

739
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:25,915
The sacrifice of the willing king,
like virgin fool, will be accepted.

740
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:29,351
But don't you see, I'll be missed?
They'll come looking for me!

741
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:32,120
There will be no traces.
Bring him up, Oak.

742
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:34,629
- Go on.
- No! No!

743
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:37,718
Think! Just think what you're doing!

744
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:40,958
Think what you're doing! Think!

745
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:44,240
In the name of God,
think what you're doing!

746
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:08,717
Oh, God! Oh, Jesus Christ!

747
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:17,238
Oh, my God! Christ!

748
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:21,670
No, no, dear God!
No, Christ!

749
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:21,710
No! No!

750
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:34,993
Mighty god of the sun,
bountiful goddess of our orchards,

751
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:40,399
accept our sacrifice
and make our blossoms fruit.

752
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:45,151
Mighty god of the sun,
bountiful goddess of our orchards...

753
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:48,039
Hear ye the words of the Lord!

754
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:53,189
- ...and make our blossoms fruit.
- Awake, ye heathens, and hold!

755
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:58,713
It is the Lord who hath
laid waste your orchards!

756
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,958
- It is he who hath made them bare!
- Reverence the sacrifice.

757
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:08,315
Because the truth is withered away
from the sons of men!

758
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:12,720
Desire shall fail!

759
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:16,639
And ye shall all die...

760
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:20,229
...accursed!

761
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:46,909
Oh, God!

762
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:06,433
Oh, God.

763
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:16,550
...who will today depart
from this world.

764
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:21,358
Do not deliver me
into the enemy's hands...

765
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,551
...or put me out of mind forever.

766
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:37,594
Let me not undergo the real pains of hell,
dear God, because I die unshriven.

767
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:45,953
...which knows no ending.

768
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:52,149
...our lord.

769
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:59,359
Jesus!

770
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:04,270
Jesus!
