1
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,698
Last night I had an ugly nightmare.

2
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:33,017
Oh, yeah?

3
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:35,117
What happened, man?

4
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:39,540
I'm lying down in my bed.
Then I get up...

5
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:44,117
and there's my mother,
may she rest in peace...

6
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:47,990
seated in a chair
with a plastic bag over her head...

7
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,344
and she can't breathe.

8
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:54,638
And I can't help her.

9
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,224
Fuck.

10
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:17,153
What do we do?

11
00:01:17,253 --> 00:01:19,633
We'll give them a half hour.

12
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:36,053
Who are they?

13
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:39,611
Don't worry.
It's just the police.

14
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:43,930
This is a private road.
You have to have a permit.

15
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,382
Do you have a permit?
- I don't have a permit.

16
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:48,482
Do you have a permit?

17
00:01:49,402 --> 00:01:51,813
Well, then, we have a problem.

18
00:01:51,913 --> 00:01:53,913
Can we buy a permit?

19
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:57,702
Yeah, but it's gonna cost you.

20
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,830
How much?
- Four hundred pesos.

21
00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:03,874
You too-- 400 pesos.

22
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:17,013
What's underneath the tarp?

23
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:20,558
Boxes of food.
- Show me.

24
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:46,542
Lay down on the ground, sweetie.
You're under arrest.

25
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:49,462
Yeah, you guys are screwed.

26
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,199
What's your name?

27
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:08,491
Javier Rodríguez Rodríguez.

28
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:11,669
Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez.

29
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:17,842
You've done an excellent job.

30
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,931
But we'll take over from here.

31
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:31,359
Put the prisoners in the Suburban
and impound the truck.

32
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:46,203
How did you find out about this?

33
00:04:48,164 --> 00:04:50,416
A little bird told me.

34
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,516
What's the name ofyour little bird?

35
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:57,757
It doesn't have a name.

36
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:02,845
Those fucking anonymous ones.

37
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:08,100
For an officer of the state police...

38
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:12,396
you're very well-informed.

39
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:26,119
Hey, was that General Salazar?
- The Big Boss himself.

40
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:29,063
What is he doing around here?

41
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,713
Up to something. I don't know.

42
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:36,212
They took our handcuffs, Manolo.

43
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:42,794
This informant, paid by police,
using taxpayers' dollars...

44
00:05:42,894 --> 00:05:45,496
to continue his felony
drug habit, was the link...

45
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:48,499
that allowed the police
to raid a private farm,

46
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:52,720
a working farm where honest
Americans make their living.

47
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,599
The government, in its haste,
has hired an army of criminals...

48
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:00,639
whose allegiance to the truth
is at best questionable.

49
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:01,762
Mr. Rodman...

50
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:05,149
it's a shame that your client
didn't use as much sense...

51
00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:07,443
in choosing what he planted...

52
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:09,988
as he did in choosing his attorney,

53
00:06:10,088 --> 00:06:12,148
but, lately,
the only variation...

54
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:16,402
I'm hearing in your argument
is the name of your client.

55
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:20,156
You can stand here all day and argue
the ins and outs of Illinois v. Gates,

56
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:22,250
but you're not gonna convince me...

57
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:26,871
that our government has not sanctioned
the use of anonymous informants.

58
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:29,462
Furthermore,
there is no sacred protection...

59
00:06:29,562 --> 00:06:31,500
of property rights in our country.

60
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,530
You grow marijuana on your farm,
be it an ounce or an acre,

61
00:06:36,614 --> 00:06:38,824
that farm can be seized...

62
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:41,152
and that farm can be sold.

63
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:46,155
What the hell is that?

64
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:50,417
You can tell a lot about somebody
from this stuff.

65
00:06:50,507 --> 00:06:53,589
It's from your friends
at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.

66
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:54,440
A fishing rod.

67
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,361
What do you think they want?
- Depends what state they're from.

68
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:01,339
Uh... Arizona.

69
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:04,175
Arizona.

70
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,494
Medicinal marijuana initiative.

71
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:08,594
Or am I being cynical?

72
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:12,016
Mark... I'm gonna miss you.

73
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:14,946
Thank you for all your hard work.

74
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,985
Hi. How are you today?

75
00:07:25,061 --> 00:07:26,610
You've got a daughter.
Why is it important to get...

76
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,765
a handle on this drug problem?

77
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:30,434
Because it's an issue
that affects all families.

78
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:34,954
But I'm planning on being
back here as much as I can.

79
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:37,049
How do you feel about--

80
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:04,802
Okay, Gordon, no telltales:
no scratching your nose,

81
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:06,929
no clearing your throat,
no crossing your legs.

82
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,931
I got it.
- You got it, babe.

83
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:12,143
I'm cool, man.
You just don't tell any jokes.

84
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:14,202
' Don't tell any jokes'?
- Don't tell jokes.

85
00:08:14,302 --> 00:08:15,313
It's a giveaway, Ray.

86
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:17,419
It's not a giveaway.
- Every time you tell a joke,

87
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,149
it's a giveaway.

88
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:20,156
Don't tell any jokes.
- You know what the problem is?

89
00:08:20,256 --> 00:08:21,152
You are too uptight, man.

90
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:23,654
Why don't you loosen up,
take a deep breath?

91
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,823
Breathe in slowly.
A little stretching maybe.

92
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,825
Come on, man. They're looking at us.
- Come on, man.

93
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:30,870
We're gonna get these motherfuckers.
We know our shit.

94
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,639
Can I get it?
Can I get it?

95
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:37,844
Oh, baby, can I say it?
- Say it. It's show time.

96
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:44,976
We're looking for Mr. Eduardo Ruiz.
We have a 2:00 appointment.

97
00:08:45,076 --> 00:08:47,678
He's right down the hallway
in the back room.

98
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,778
Thank you.

99
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,081
Come in. Hey, fellas.

100
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,192
Come on, you guys. Get him talking.

101
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:04,503
Get him outside.
- How you doing?

102
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:07,433
I'm well. How are you?
- I'm good.

103
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:12,536
Look, what's up, Ed?
We gonna move some white or what?

104
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:15,319
You guys ever bought a quarter ton before?

105
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:17,558
No?
- I don't think so.

106
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:21,562
It's a big fucking deal, all right?

107
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,589
It's not like you can stick it
in a condom up some mule's asshole.

108
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:25,514
How many peasants is that
gonna take? You'd have a line...

109
00:09:25,614 --> 00:09:26,384
from here to Mexico City.

110
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:32,098
You say show up at a time, we show up at
the time and we're fucking sitting here.

111
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:34,276
Sure I can't offer you something to drink?

112
00:09:34,376 --> 00:09:35,393
I can offer you ajoke.

113
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:38,863
You want to hear a joke? I got
a joke, I got a joke. Come on, bro.

114
00:09:38,963 --> 00:09:41,199
It's just a joke. Let me tell one joke.
I'm gonna tell you a joke.

115
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:45,544
All right, why are hurricane
named after women?

116
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,764
I don't know.
- Because when they arrive.

117
00:09:47,864 --> 00:09:48,906
they're wet and wild.

118
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:53,256
When they leave, they take
your house and your car.

119
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:56,163
It's true.
- You didn't find that funny?

120
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,263
I chuckled. Damn.

121
00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:01,227
Fellas... that's us.
- Yo.

122
00:10:06,107 --> 00:10:12,057
Okay, that's the van. Don't make
your move until they get Ruiz outside.

123
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:19,148
I told you there was nothing to worry about.

124
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:23,074
I got another joke.

125
00:10:23,174 --> 00:10:25,651
Come on. Please.
- Just one more. Relax.

126
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:28,112
A guy goes, gets a tattoo put on his penis.

127
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:30,823
One side says yes,
the other side says no.

128
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:33,117
On his penis?
- Yeah. The words 'yes' and 'no.'

129
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:38,610
So, his wife says, 'Hold it. You tell me
how to cook, how to clean the house--'

130
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,459
Who the fuck is that?
- That's local.

131
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:44,395
What the fuck is going--

132
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,689
Shit. Agent down.

133
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:48,814
Get in there now. Go.

134
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:04,957
D.E.A..

135
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:15,752
The vest caught it.
Go ahead.

136
00:11:15,852 --> 00:11:18,804
Go. Shit.

137
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:57,259
Shit.

138
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:04,611
I think we lost him, Ray.
- Yeah, I think so too.

139
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:09,897
Don't fucking move.
Get your hands-- Move.

140
00:13:09,977 --> 00:13:11,943
Get out, you son of a bitch.
Get out.

141
00:13:12,043 --> 00:13:16,422
Is this what they wear to go to sleep...

142
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:19,450
or do they hang out like this
the whole time?

143
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:23,704
That would be sleep attire.
- It's like a smoking jacket.

144
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:26,165
He's gonna be smoking in a minute.

145
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:29,252
Okay, who's the father of
Greek tragedy? Anyone? Anyone?

146
00:13:29,352 --> 00:13:31,879
Okay, Aeschylus it is.
His trilogy? The Oresteia.

147
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:36,717
This is fucking beautiful. Can anyone--
Can anyone stop the Seth machine?

148
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:40,488
No.
- That's correct. Score.

149
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:45,993
And 'tragedy' is closed out.

150
00:13:48,621 --> 00:13:50,998
But wait.

151
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:54,126
Is he her husband?
- Yes.

152
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:58,297
Oh, hey, so, uh...
you want to try something?

153
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,423
Yeah.

154
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:13,688
What are you doing?
- Just watch.

155
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:33,065
What you're going to do is
inhale the smoke and hold it.

156
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:35,234
What is this, like freebase?

157
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:38,254
Not 'like.' It is.

158
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:44,394
Okay, go.
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

159
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:51,809
Hold it.
Hold it.

160
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,936
See?

161
00:14:58,816 --> 00:15:00,816
Now you see.

162
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:37,305
Oh, how-- Oh, they're doing great.

163
00:15:37,405 --> 00:15:40,107
Look at how cute they are.

164
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:43,636
Helena, he's doing so good.
- Little Tiger.

165
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:46,697
Little Tiger, I hope.

166
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:49,442
We'll be very happy if he
becomes the next Tiger Woods.

167
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:51,444
So will his bank balance.

168
00:15:51,544 --> 00:15:54,480
My God. Duck?
- Duck. Thank you very much.

169
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,816
Helena, you never order duck.
- I know, I know.

170
00:15:56,916 --> 00:16:00,641
It's not me who ordered it.
It's somebody else.

171
00:16:00,741 --> 00:16:03,322
Well, he or she has very good taste.

172
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:04,729
I love duck, don't you?
- It's delicious.

173
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:05,700
Do you want some, Nan?

174
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,845
Oh, yes. Thank you.
- It's such a fatty bird.

175
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,650
There's good cholesterol,
and there's bad cholesterol,

176
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,540
which is confusing to me.

177
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,335
Mmm, that's so good.
- You know what they say about red wine.

178
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:18,588
It's good for you.
There's cholesterol in my wine.

179
00:16:18,688 --> 00:16:21,507
You're allowed to have your red wine.
- The French do, don't they?

180
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,509
I'm European.
I say that to my doctor.

181
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:26,679
'I'm European.
I'm allowed to drink red wine.'

182
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:29,056
Oh, my doctor said it was fine
when I was pregnant.

183
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:32,159
A glass a week.
- After my amnio,

184
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:34,520
he said, 'Okay, now you can go
and have a glass ofred wine.'

185
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,873
I had two....

186
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,171
Did you have fun?
- Yeah.

187
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:45,430
Thanks a lot.
- Can I bring the bag...

188
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,198
in the backwith me?

189
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:49,076
No, sweetheart.
- How about just my putter?

190
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:51,370
Give me the putter.
- All right.

191
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,530
In you get. Come on.
We've got to go.

192
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:57,393
Put this down here, okay?

193
00:16:57,518 --> 00:17:00,004
That's where Tiger Woods keeps it.
Thank you.

194
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:03,190
You're welcome.
- Okay.

195
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:08,888
David, you're gonna have to promise me,
no swinging the club in the car.

196
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:10,988
Okay.

197
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:15,895
Until you officially take over the
Office of National Drug Control Policy,

198
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:18,981
under no circumstances will you speak
to the press unprotected...

199
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,992
without going through this office...

200
00:17:21,092 --> 00:17:23,402
or having someone in the room.

201
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:25,780
There are a lot of interests in this town.

202
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,782
Right now,
they're scared of you.

203
00:17:27,882 --> 00:17:30,814
The reason they're scared
of you: Technically, you have...

204
00:17:30,914 --> 00:17:32,578
veto powers over their budgets.

205
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:35,081
You'll also be meeting
senators and congressmen,

206
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:37,458
each with a specially prepared question.

207
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:41,087
They're questions designed for
one thing-- to make them look smart.

208
00:17:41,187 --> 00:17:43,506
If you lecture them,
they won't think you respect them.

209
00:17:43,606 --> 00:17:46,092
If you treat them
with utter humility, they will.

210
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:49,595
This is about your respect for them
and the president's respect for them.

211
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:52,598
Speaking of which, when he
gets back from Russia and China,

212
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:56,143
we'll get you two together for
some face time, let you two catch up.

213
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:58,826
Also, one month from today,
you will give your first...

214
00:17:58,926 --> 00:18:00,189
official press conference.

215
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:05,119
In it, you will outline the president's
strategy for winning the war on drugs.

216
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:08,155
Judge, I just want to be
clear about one thing:

217
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,491
I am not a partisan person,
I am an issue person.

218
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:13,119
Over the course of the next few weeks,
if you allow me.

219
00:18:13,219 --> 00:18:15,830
I will bring you up to speed
on an incredible array of issues,

220
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,250
the most important ofwhich,
in my opinion, Mexico.

221
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,503
I know everyone you're going to meet.
I know what they want and why.

222
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:24,797
It is important that they like you.

223
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:27,141
It is not important that they like me.

224
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:29,802
That is why I can help protect you.

225
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:32,613
Like you protected Landry?

226
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:35,016
I see where you're going with that.

227
00:18:35,116 --> 00:18:39,186
If I could say one thing: Basically,
a guy like Landry is so autocratic,

228
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:41,772
he doesn't even know how
to let himself be helped.

229
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:44,826
There's a political component
to this job that the general...

230
00:18:44,926 --> 00:18:46,402
didn't have any patience for.

231
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:47,975
General, Bob Wakefield.

232
00:18:48,075 --> 00:18:49,530
General, Bob Wakefield.

233
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,750
Judge, nice to meet you. Thank you.
- A pleasure to meet you, sir.

234
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:57,138
Jeff, you want to excuse us?

235
00:18:57,263 --> 00:18:59,757
Yes, sir.
I'll be right outside.

236
00:18:59,857 --> 00:19:02,343
Have a seat.
- Thank you.

237
00:19:02,443 --> 00:19:04,429
You've done a fine job, General.

238
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:07,048
The Office of National Drug Control Policy...

239
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:09,675
is in better shape than when you found it.

240
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:12,845
I'm not sure I made the slightest difference.

241
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:16,365
I tried. I really did.

242
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,393
I think there are some positive signs.
The work's just started.

243
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:21,771
I plan on seeing it through.
You can count on that.

244
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:25,271
You're here for two years,
three maximum.

245
00:19:25,362 --> 00:19:28,778
What'd they offer you,
a court appointment?

246
00:19:28,878 --> 00:19:32,206
District? Appeals?
Not Supreme.

247
00:19:32,306 --> 00:19:36,896
This is a tough enough job.
I plan on focusing on this.

248
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:42,224
You know, when Khrushchev
was forced out,

249
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,586
he sat down, he wrote two letters
and gave them to his successor.

250
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:51,425
He said, 'When you get yourself
into a situation you can't get out of,

251
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:55,054
'open the first letter,
and you'll be saved.

252
00:19:55,154 --> 00:19:58,266
'And when you get yourself into
another situation you can't get out of,

253
00:19:58,366 --> 00:20:00,409
open the second letter.'

254
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:03,771
Well, soon enough, this guy
found himself in a tight place,

255
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:09,402
so he opened the first letter,
which said, ' Blame everything on me.'

256
00:20:09,502 --> 00:20:12,280
So, he blamed the old man.
It worked like a charm.

257
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,949
He got himself into a second situation
he couldn't get out of,

258
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:16,951
and he opened the second letter.

259
00:20:17,051 --> 00:20:21,597
It said, 'Sit down and write two letters.'

260
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,270
Yeah.

261
00:20:39,949 --> 00:20:42,143
Don't you want to know
what kind of car it is?

262
00:20:42,243 --> 00:20:45,599
It's a brown Ford Explorer.
- It was here. It's been stolen.

263
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:46,939
I want to file a report.

264
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,151
A report will not help you find your car.

265
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:53,621
The police won't find your car.
- You are the police.

266
00:20:53,721 --> 00:20:58,032
You call this man...
and he'll find your car.

267
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,377
I don't get it.

268
00:20:59,477 --> 00:21:02,330
How is this guy gonna know
who has our car?

269
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,555
The police will tell him.

270
00:21:04,641 --> 00:21:07,168
Why will they tell him,
and they won't tell us?

271
00:21:07,268 --> 00:21:09,178
Because we pay him, stupid.

272
00:21:09,278 --> 00:21:12,006
Right? And he pays the police,
and suddenly our car appears.

273
00:21:12,106 --> 00:21:15,143
Es correct.
Es correct.

274
00:21:15,243 --> 00:21:18,898
Just give him the money.
Give him the money.

275
00:21:18,985 --> 00:21:21,682
Let's start moving to the sidewalk.
- Here, take it.

276
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:24,268
No. No, no.
- No, please, take it.

277
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:28,022
Let's start moving to the sidewalk.
Let's go to the sidewalk.

278
00:21:28,122 --> 00:21:31,125
Call the man.
Have a nice day.

279
00:21:49,435 --> 00:21:52,521
Javier Rodriguez.
- Si.

280
00:21:58,027 --> 00:22:00,529
We want you to come with us.

281
00:22:01,906 --> 00:22:04,992
Where?
- It's just a short trip.

282
00:22:08,204 --> 00:22:09,113
Follow me.

283
00:22:09,213 --> 00:22:11,213
Bien.

284
00:22:22,343 --> 00:22:24,462
I would say one thing to you, Judge,

285
00:22:24,562 --> 00:22:27,915
and that's you're never gonna solve
this problem on the supply side.

286
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:30,585
As long as that demand
is out there in our cities.

287
00:22:30,685 --> 00:22:33,137
Mexico bashing is not gonna do
a damn thing for you.

288
00:22:33,237 --> 00:22:36,118
We in the legal drug business--
Merck and Pfizer and the rest...

289
00:22:36,218 --> 00:22:37,592
of my very important clients--...

290
00:22:37,692 --> 00:22:40,535
realize that we're not fighting
a war here with a traditional...

291
00:22:40,635 --> 00:22:41,470
winner and loser.

292
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,472
I don't know that you can win this war.

293
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:45,474
Everybody says we want
to declare war on drugs,

294
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:48,945
but if 25% of high school seniors
are using drugs--...

295
00:22:49,045 --> 00:22:51,624
If you reduce that to 10,
that's a great improvement.

296
00:22:51,724 --> 00:22:51,981
Right.

297
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:54,442
I'll congratulate you.
That would be a phenomenal achievement,

298
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:57,570
but you'd still have 10%
habitually using drugs.

299
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,851
Can I get a scotch and soda, please?

300
00:22:59,951 --> 00:23:02,283
The price of coke and heroin has dropped,

301
00:23:02,383 --> 00:23:05,086
but purity has increased.

302
00:23:05,186 --> 00:23:07,344
All this law enforcement
has really achieved is that...

303
00:23:07,444 --> 00:23:08,664
kids get better stuff cheaper.

304
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:11,334
Education, rehabilitation,
prevention--...

305
00:23:11,434 --> 00:23:13,336
that's not significant to these reporters.

306
00:23:13,436 --> 00:23:15,338
Mm-hmm.
- They want to see people in prison.

307
00:23:15,438 --> 00:23:18,391
They want to see the gory aspect
of the drug problem.

308
00:23:18,491 --> 00:23:20,393
Thank you so much for sharing
your point of view.

309
00:23:20,493 --> 00:23:22,245
I look forward to working
with you in the future.

310
00:23:22,345 --> 00:23:22,803
Well, call me.

311
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:24,452
I have a good bill on treatment-on-demand.

312
00:23:24,552 --> 00:23:25,306
I could use your help.

313
00:23:25,406 --> 00:23:27,323
Wonderful. Look forward to it.
Thanks, Senator.

314
00:23:27,423 --> 00:23:27,892
Okay. Great.

315
00:23:27,992 --> 00:23:30,862
If a judge or a politician is willing
to put a reefer in their mouth.

316
00:23:30,962 --> 00:23:32,864
I'll do a story on it.
- Right.

317
00:23:32,964 --> 00:23:34,866
Stand up and be independent.
- Right.

318
00:23:34,966 --> 00:23:37,318
I don't care who's president. I don't
care who the members of congress are.

319
00:23:37,418 --> 00:23:39,320
I don't care who you have to deal with.

320
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,468
If you're independent and you
use that bully pulpit right.

321
00:23:42,568 --> 00:23:44,033
that's where your power is.

322
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:46,035
It's the stick of law enforcement
that creates...

323
00:23:46,135 --> 00:23:48,162
the carrot of huge profit
that is economic truth.

324
00:23:48,262 --> 00:23:50,262
Addicts don't vote.

325
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:59,659
What the hell are you doing here?

326
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:03,361
You like your view?

327
00:24:03,486 --> 00:24:07,281
TV screen big enough?
- How's the food?

328
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,687
Hope it's all good because this
is as good as it's gonna get...

329
00:24:12,787 --> 00:24:15,498
for a long time, Eduardo.

330
00:24:15,623 --> 00:24:18,951
I'm a legitimate businessman.
I've got tuna boats. I'm a fisherman.

331
00:24:19,051 --> 00:24:20,953
Check it out.
- Shut the fuck up.

332
00:24:21,053 --> 00:24:23,414
Fucking can it, bitch.
- You can't come in here like that.

333
00:24:23,514 --> 00:24:25,041
I want to see my lawyer.
- Okay.

334
00:24:25,141 --> 00:24:27,677
It's cool, man.

335
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:31,923
Eddie... you're in a lot of trouble.
- It's cool.

336
00:24:35,476 --> 00:24:38,588
You know what? The amount of coke
we found on this creep--...

337
00:24:38,688 --> 00:24:40,859
that's capital punishment
in some states, right?

338
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:41,924
Yeah, down in Texas.

339
00:24:42,024 --> 00:24:43,926
They'll fry him.
- Definitely.

340
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:45,928
We've got him making the deal on tape.

341
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:48,889
We got him bragging
about the quality, about his business.

342
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:51,434
We got this motherfucker.
- You're fucked.

343
00:24:51,534 --> 00:24:53,534
No, no, he's fucked.

344
00:24:57,373 --> 00:25:01,028
I only see one way out of this predicament.

345
00:25:07,008 --> 00:25:10,578
You make us believe you got a boss, Eddie.

346
00:25:11,387 --> 00:25:13,423
Look, no boss, it's all on you.

347
00:25:13,523 --> 00:25:15,523
No.

348
00:25:15,617 --> 00:25:18,461
No, that's a death sentence.
I'd never make it to the trial.

349
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:22,432
Look, we're gonna protect you.

350
00:25:22,532 --> 00:25:25,847
Who you working for?
- This is coercion.

351
00:25:27,445 --> 00:25:29,472
That's a big word for a fisherman.

352
00:25:29,572 --> 00:25:32,491
Big-ass word.
Who you working for?

353
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:35,745
I know another big word.

354
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:37,913
Immunity.

355
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,919
Take it easy, will you?

356
00:25:46,008 --> 00:25:47,874
What's going on in here?

357
00:25:47,974 --> 00:25:49,682
We have a warrant
to search your premises.

358
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:49,992
What?

359
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:52,094
Carl.

360
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,263
My husband.

361
00:25:54,388 --> 00:25:56,388
Relax. Ma'am.
- Carl.

362
00:25:56,464 --> 00:25:58,718
Ma'am, right here.
You can't go any further.

363
00:25:58,818 --> 00:26:01,554
David, come here.
- Ma'am, I have a search warrant.

364
00:26:01,654 --> 00:26:03,381
He'll be back.

365
00:26:03,481 --> 00:26:07,818
Where are they taking Daddy?

366
00:26:07,943 --> 00:26:09,943
He'll be all right.

367
00:26:11,614 --> 00:26:13,816
He's all right. They're just gonna
take him to the office and talk.

368
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:15,810
Just relax.
They're not going to hurt him.

369
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,187
I don't understand what's going on.
- He'll be all right.

370
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:20,856
What are they doing to Daddy?
- Daddy's gonna be okay.

371
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:24,627
It's okay, sweetheart.
It's okay, baby.

372
00:26:40,476 --> 00:26:42,086
Not you.

373
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:44,186
You.

374
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:49,775
I'll wait here.

375
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:53,989
Five years with the Tijuana police.

376
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:58,661
Three years in the state police.

377
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:06,419
Your parents died when their house
flooded in the rains of '93.

378
00:27:08,713 --> 00:27:10,840
How unfortunate.

379
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:20,474
You make $316 a month.

380
00:27:22,768 --> 00:27:24,854
That's what they pay.

381
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:27,604
Well, look.

382
00:27:30,568 --> 00:27:34,321
This could be your past.

383
00:27:37,116 --> 00:27:40,953
We can talk about your future...

384
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:45,791
if you can do me a favor.

385
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,250
If I can.

386
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:56,886
I want to wipe out the Tijuana cartel.

387
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:03,476
What can I do to help?

388
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:10,191
His name is Francisco Flores.

389
00:28:10,816 --> 00:28:13,110
He's an assassin.

390
00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:16,906
He runs guns for the Tijuana cartel.

391
00:28:18,282 --> 00:28:20,993
I have to talk to him.

392
00:28:21,118 --> 00:28:25,539
I need you to find him and bring him here.

393
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:30,399
This is crazy.
- Don't freak out, Manolo.

394
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:33,879
Don't you know who 'Frankie Flowers' is?

395
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:39,295
A hired assassin. A psychopath.
Fucking crazy.

396
00:28:39,395 --> 00:28:43,874
Who knows how many he's killed.
- Then I'll go by myself.

397
00:28:43,974 --> 00:28:46,219
And we can't ask for help...

398
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:48,869
because he lives in San Diego.

399
00:28:56,612 --> 00:28:58,612
Ah.

400
00:28:58,688 --> 00:29:02,994
Well... is this a surprise or what?

401
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:05,162
An honor.
Thank you.

402
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:07,498
Hi, sweetie.
- Good trip?

403
00:29:07,623 --> 00:29:09,906
How are you?
- Good trip. I'm good.

404
00:29:10,006 --> 00:29:11,485
I just can't believe this.

405
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:15,172
What's Washington like?
- It's like, uh--

406
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:18,367
It's like Calcutta; surrounded by beggars.

407
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:21,370
Only these beggars
are wearing $1,500 suits...

408
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:25,210
and they don't say 'please' and 'thank you.'

409
00:29:26,934 --> 00:29:29,462
So, we put
the case before the arbitration panel,

410
00:29:29,562 --> 00:29:31,931
none of whom have any expertise.

411
00:29:32,031 --> 00:29:33,933
'Superfund' is just one of those words.

412
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:35,935
People stop paying attention.

413
00:29:36,035 --> 00:29:40,406
It's frustrating.
- It's so frustrating.

414
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:42,433
Did you meet the president?

415
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:45,102
Honey, your father knows the president.

416
00:29:45,202 --> 00:29:48,105
It just so happens... that
the president of the United States,

417
00:29:48,205 --> 00:29:50,107
my new boss,
the leader of the free world,

418
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:53,286
has penciled me in for a little face time.

419
00:29:53,386 --> 00:29:56,727
None of my friends can fucking believe
my dad's actually the drug czar.

420
00:29:56,827 --> 00:30:01,719
Caroline.
- I'm sorry, but, I mean, come on.

421
00:30:01,844 --> 00:30:04,764
It's great.
It's great, Daddy.

422
00:30:04,889 --> 00:30:08,434
It's just amazing, that's all.

423
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:16,273
Arnie, thank God.

424
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:18,582
Helena, I am so--

425
00:30:18,682 --> 00:30:20,763
Please tell me what's going on here.

426
00:30:20,863 --> 00:30:23,766
What is going on? They came into
the house. They just took him away.

427
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:26,444
They searched my home.

428
00:30:26,544 --> 00:30:30,199
Let me tell you what's happening.
All right?

429
00:30:30,373 --> 00:30:33,751
First of all, Carl is not here.

430
00:30:33,876 --> 00:30:36,253
The D.E.A. has got him.

431
00:30:36,379 --> 00:30:38,447
They're gonna hang onto him
until his arraignment,

432
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:40,992
which will probably be tomorrow.

433
00:30:41,092 --> 00:30:44,962
So here you are wasting your time.
All right? Are you with me?

434
00:30:45,062 --> 00:30:48,541
Yeah.
- Okay. Now, do not discuss anything...

435
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:51,102
over the telephone.

436
00:30:51,227 --> 00:30:54,505
Don't talk to your neighbors.
Stay out of your yard.

437
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:57,341
What is he charged with, Arnie?
- I don't know,

438
00:30:57,441 --> 00:31:02,221
but under no circumstances
am I going to talk about it here.

439
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:06,492
Now, you go home and be with your son.
All right?

440
00:32:01,172 --> 00:32:03,172
Miss?

441
00:32:03,248 --> 00:32:05,248
Can I have a Budweiser?

442
00:32:13,726 --> 00:32:16,771
Excuse me.
- Yes?

443
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:19,940
Can you give me a cigarette?

444
00:33:16,455 --> 00:33:21,300
It would be interesting to know
how you did it so quickly.

445
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,630
We all have our weak side.

446
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:30,177
The path of the Lord is very subtle.

447
00:33:30,594 --> 00:33:32,594
Amen.

448
00:33:40,438 --> 00:33:42,438
What a badass.

449
00:33:46,277 --> 00:33:51,115
All I'm saying--
What I'm-- What I'm saying is...

450
00:33:51,282 --> 00:33:55,519
it never seems like anyone ever says
anything that matters to them.

451
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:59,957
We all look at each other
and nod with these--...

452
00:34:00,124 --> 00:34:05,997
these responses
that we've been trained to make.

453
00:34:06,097 --> 00:34:08,199
Responses-- Not real responses.

454
00:34:08,299 --> 00:34:13,346
Social conventions,
like phony, fake smiles;

455
00:34:13,471 --> 00:34:15,506
surface bullshit.

456
00:34:15,606 --> 00:34:17,683
Do I ever just say:

457
00:34:17,808 --> 00:34:21,479
' Hey... I'm uncomfortable in this crowd.'

458
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:24,048
'I don't know what the fuck
I'm doing either.'

459
00:34:24,148 --> 00:34:28,386
'l know you're afraid,
and that's okay, you know, because--'

460
00:34:28,486 --> 00:34:32,198
Hello? Fucking... exactly.

461
00:34:32,323 --> 00:34:34,225
We act like we have all the answers
and we're totally invincible...

462
00:34:34,325 --> 00:34:36,227
like our parents seem
and their parents before them.

463
00:34:36,327 --> 00:34:39,564
I'm sorry I have to be the one
to say this, but it's fucking bullshit.

464
00:34:39,664 --> 00:34:41,236
For instance?
- I know you jack off...

465
00:34:41,336 --> 00:34:42,400
to Caroline every night,

466
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,569
instead of Vanessa,
who you're supposed to be in love with.

467
00:34:44,669 --> 00:34:48,409
Don't even get me started
on that convention.

468
00:34:48,509 --> 00:34:50,408
Because what is that convention?

469
00:34:50,508 --> 00:34:51,788
We're this random collection
of self interests,

470
00:34:51,888 --> 00:34:52,785
and all of a sudden we decide...

471
00:34:52,885 --> 00:34:57,456
that we're gonna walk two-by-two
down the fucking aisle to Noah's Ark?

472
00:34:57,556 --> 00:35:01,294
Actually, for your information,
when I jerk off.

473
00:35:01,394 --> 00:35:04,755
I'm not just thinking about Caroline,
I'm thinking about you with Caroline.

474
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:07,566
So, how about that?
- Baby--

475
00:35:09,402 --> 00:35:14,240
That is what I'm talking about-- sarcasm.

476
00:35:14,365 --> 00:35:17,576
Always fucking sarcasm.

477
00:35:17,702 --> 00:35:21,272
You're afraid, and you think
that if you admit that,

478
00:35:21,372 --> 00:35:23,816
people will think that you are weak...

479
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:26,961
or they won't like you...

480
00:35:27,086 --> 00:35:30,615
or whatever it is you think will happen, but--

481
00:35:30,715 --> 00:35:34,952
Can you shut up for one second
and listen to yourself?

482
00:35:35,052 --> 00:35:37,052
Wh-What?

483
00:35:37,128 --> 00:35:42,309
Because you are so fucking right.

484
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:44,637
I'm so fucking high.
- Yeah?

485
00:35:44,737 --> 00:35:46,981
Yeah.
- Okay, wait.

486
00:35:47,106 --> 00:35:49,108
Why don't we...

487
00:35:49,233 --> 00:35:52,945
change this thing,
this social pattern?

488
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,680
Why don't we be different?

489
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,732
Yeah.
- But then why are you...

490
00:35:56,832 --> 00:35:58,309
even talking about it?

491
00:35:58,409 --> 00:36:00,645
But we're making it,
like, from now on.

492
00:36:00,745 --> 00:36:04,332
You're like,
'Why don't we do something?'

493
00:36:04,457 --> 00:36:06,868
Why don't you do something?
- That's what I'm saying, Seth.

494
00:36:06,968 --> 00:36:09,106
You do it yourself--
- I'm saying if you knew it.

495
00:36:09,206 --> 00:36:10,363
you wouldn't even say it.

496
00:36:10,463 --> 00:36:12,373
Vanessa, I'm serious, I feel fucked up.

497
00:36:12,473 --> 00:36:16,677
It's a social pattern, you know?

498
00:36:20,306 --> 00:36:24,477
Spence, baby, are you all right?

499
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:26,587
He's fucking blue.
He isn't breathing.

500
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:29,724
Oh, my God, Fucked-up Bowman's
fucked up.

501
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:33,144
Wait--
- What the fuck do we do?

502
00:36:33,244 --> 00:36:36,564
Uh-- Oh, God--
- Fuck.

503
00:36:36,664 --> 00:36:40,560
Somebody call a doctor.
- Wait, your dad's a doctor. Call him.

504
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,029
No, he's a research--
Call your dad. He's a doctor.

505
00:36:43,129 --> 00:36:45,907
What kind of research?
- Mapping the fucking pig genome.

506
00:36:46,007 --> 00:36:48,242
Call your dad.
He's a neurosurgeon.

507
00:36:48,342 --> 00:36:50,411
I can't call my dad.
It's 3:00 in the morning.

508
00:36:50,511 --> 00:36:54,532
He's gonna fucking die right here
on the floor if you don't do something.

509
00:36:54,632 --> 00:36:59,562
No, he can't die on the floor.
His parents are in Barbados.

510
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:10,896
Move. Move.

511
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:33,254
Okay, nobody has anything on them, right?

512
00:37:33,379 --> 00:37:35,379
Fuck.

513
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:47,929
We know that you killed
our chief of intelligence.

514
00:37:49,061 --> 00:37:51,188
We also know that you...

515
00:37:51,689 --> 00:37:57,403
killed police chiefs
in Tijuana and Mexico City.

516
00:37:59,697 --> 00:38:01,697
A question.

517
00:38:02,658 --> 00:38:04,658
Why do you resist?

518
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:12,043
My father has money.

519
00:38:12,543 --> 00:38:15,504
That is not the correct answer.

520
00:38:17,465 --> 00:38:19,592
We also found out...

521
00:38:19,717 --> 00:38:23,504
that you hunted down
a neighbor of General Salazar.

522
00:38:23,604 --> 00:38:26,174
A poor peasant.

523
00:38:26,274 --> 00:38:29,419
Your people killed his granddaughter.

524
00:38:30,728 --> 00:38:33,278
That was a stupid thing to do.

525
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:36,025
You fucked up.

526
00:39:29,996 --> 00:39:33,207
I'm on the board of my son's school.

527
00:39:33,332 --> 00:39:39,046
I have fund-raisers
for adult literacy at my own home.

528
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:45,586
I think I have a right to know if
my husband is a legitimate businessman.

529
00:39:45,686 --> 00:39:48,222
Of course he is.

530
00:39:48,347 --> 00:39:52,852
I've known Carl for 20 years.
He doesn't even jaywalk.

531
00:39:56,856 --> 00:40:02,207
Carl is a very important member of this
community, and when we get through...

532
00:40:02,307 --> 00:40:04,764
suing the police and
the district attorney and the D.E.A.,

533
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:10,049
they're gonna be renaming
the public parks after your husband.

534
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:16,584
Carl is very, very good at his business.

535
00:40:19,879 --> 00:40:24,425
Which is smuggling illegal drugs
into this country.

536
00:40:37,688 --> 00:40:39,567
They're whispering.
They're whispering.

537
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:39,966
I know.

538
00:40:40,066 --> 00:40:42,121
Can't hear it.
- I know. The fucking bug's...

539
00:40:42,221 --> 00:40:43,636
too far away from the room.

540
00:40:43,736 --> 00:40:46,105
It's halfway to the kitchen.
We're not gonna get shit.

541
00:40:46,205 --> 00:40:48,107
They're saying something.

542
00:40:48,207 --> 00:40:50,693
Sounds like they're conspiring to conspire.

543
00:40:50,793 --> 00:40:54,703
I can feel the lies vibrating from their home.

544
00:40:55,748 --> 00:40:57,650
I don't think she's in on it, man.

545
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:01,320
Come on, I dream about this.
I have actual dreams about this.

546
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,490
About busting the top people,
the rich people.

547
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:07,293
White people. Hey.
- White people. I know, I know.

548
00:41:07,393 --> 00:41:10,162
I don't think she's in on it, man.

549
00:41:10,262 --> 00:41:13,140
She knows Arnie Metzger.

550
00:41:13,265 --> 00:41:15,810
So does half of San Diego.

551
00:41:15,935 --> 00:41:18,671
You want to bet?
- Get in your pocket.

552
00:41:18,771 --> 00:41:20,840
I got--
- I love it. I love it when you do this.

553
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,844
How much you want to bet? How much?
- I got-- I got 12 bucks.

554
00:41:24,944 --> 00:41:28,514
Okay, give me ten. We'll make it even.
- Okay.

555
00:41:28,614 --> 00:41:31,617
Beautiful.
- Wait a minute. What?

556
00:41:35,621 --> 00:41:38,916
How old are you?
- Sixteen.

557
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:42,628
Live with your parents?

558
00:41:42,753 --> 00:41:45,123
Yes.

559
00:41:45,223 --> 00:41:47,223
Parents still together?

560
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:49,299
Yes.

561
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:54,682
Do you work?
- I volunteer.

562
00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:59,269
I read to blind people,
one day a week for two hours.

563
00:42:00,312 --> 00:42:02,312
In school?

564
00:42:02,388 --> 00:42:05,026
Yes.

565
00:42:05,151 --> 00:42:07,151
Private?

566
00:42:07,227 --> 00:42:09,227
Yeah.

567
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:13,200
How are your grades?

568
00:42:13,326 --> 00:42:18,031
I'm third in my class.
- What does that mean?

569
00:42:18,131 --> 00:42:23,085
I get A's, all A's.
- You do?

570
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,546
What else do you do?

571
00:42:25,671 --> 00:42:27,949
I'm a National Merit Finalist.

572
00:42:28,049 --> 00:42:31,044
I'm on the Hi-Q Team and the Math Team.

573
00:42:31,144 --> 00:42:33,788
I'm in the Spanish Club.
I'm a thespian.

574
00:42:33,888 --> 00:42:36,924
I'm vice president of my class.

575
00:42:37,024 --> 00:42:39,319
I'm on the volleyball team.

576
00:42:43,397 --> 00:42:47,817
You want to tell me
what you're doing here, Caroline?

577
00:43:05,294 --> 00:43:07,294
Carol.

578
00:43:08,714 --> 00:43:11,258
Oh, sweetie.

579
00:43:14,178 --> 00:43:16,178
You okay?

580
00:43:17,807 --> 00:43:19,807
It's okay.

581
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:24,013
Caroline, how well did you know
this boy that overdosed?

582
00:43:24,113 --> 00:43:27,483
He didn't hang around us.

583
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:30,344
He was like one of those hippie kids.

584
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:32,739
I'm not part of that group.

585
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:39,620
How well did you know this boy Seth,
the one that was driving?

586
00:43:41,372 --> 00:43:44,333
He's a friend.

587
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:48,579
He's also the only one that was doing
anything about the situation.

588
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:53,084
He definitely had a few beers, but...

589
00:43:53,184 --> 00:43:55,328
it's not like he wanted to drive.

590
00:43:55,428 --> 00:43:57,997
We just didn't know what else to do.

591
00:43:58,097 --> 00:44:01,642
It wasn't my pot.

592
00:44:04,103 --> 00:44:08,107
Okay, we understand, honey.
We've got to talk.

593
00:44:08,232 --> 00:44:10,276
Alone.

594
00:44:18,492 --> 00:44:21,162
I think she's lying.
- Me too.

595
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:23,856
So let's ground her,
clip her wings:

596
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:27,235
school, scheduled activities
till further notice.

597
00:44:27,335 --> 00:44:32,548
Robert, honey, Caroline
clearly used very bad judgment,

598
00:44:32,673 --> 00:44:37,912
but don't you think spending a night
in jail is punishment enough?

599
00:44:38,012 --> 00:44:41,215
I mean, we've all had our moments.

600
00:44:41,315 --> 00:44:43,663
Lord knows, I tried every drug there was--

601
00:44:43,763 --> 00:44:45,461
I don't want to hear about that.

602
00:44:45,561 --> 00:44:48,422
You experimented
when you were in college.

603
00:44:48,522 --> 00:44:50,424
Shall we take the quotes off
experiment and call it what it was?

604
00:44:50,524 --> 00:44:52,426
This is different.
- Why?

605
00:44:52,526 --> 00:44:56,004
She's 16 years old.
- I think she needs to find out...

606
00:44:56,104 --> 00:44:57,765
for herself, on her own.

607
00:44:57,865 --> 00:44:59,941
We have to allow her room to figure out--

608
00:45:00,041 --> 00:45:01,435
You want to give her room?

609
00:45:01,535 --> 00:45:03,655
So she can O.D.
like that other kid?

610
00:45:03,755 --> 00:45:07,942
I am not sending out the message that
our family will accept this behavior...

611
00:45:08,042 --> 00:45:10,042
because we do not.

612
00:45:10,118 --> 00:45:12,236
Correct?
- Of course, but we don't want...

613
00:45:12,336 --> 00:45:13,322
to push her away.

614
00:45:13,422 --> 00:45:18,552
She has to know that we understand
what she's exposed to.

615
00:45:18,678 --> 00:45:21,653
How long have you known about this?

616
00:45:23,724 --> 00:45:26,102
How long have you known?

617
00:45:29,063 --> 00:45:31,063
Six months.

618
00:45:38,197 --> 00:45:42,277
My technique is more profound
than yours, Javier.

619
00:45:43,411 --> 00:45:45,663
Much more profound.

620
00:45:46,205 --> 00:45:49,000
When he loves me like a father,

621
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:52,355
he will never tell anyone he was here.

622
00:45:53,796 --> 00:45:57,451
He will give me the names of his superiors.

623
00:45:57,633 --> 00:46:02,096
Then we get them
and they too will give us names.

624
00:46:04,765 --> 00:46:10,688
And eventually somebody
will get us to Juan Obregón.

625
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:17,820
And on that day,
the Tijuana cartel will fall.

626
00:46:33,336 --> 00:46:35,336
What a disgrace.

627
00:46:37,298 --> 00:46:40,188
What a disgrace, Francisco Flores.

628
00:46:41,302 --> 00:46:44,638
It's all right. Salazar is here.

629
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:49,602
You're among friends now.

630
00:46:50,061 --> 00:46:53,886
This shameful treatment
will stop immediately.

631
00:46:53,985 --> 00:46:55,985
Guard.

632
00:46:56,233 --> 00:46:58,233
Yes, General.

633
00:47:00,613 --> 00:47:03,407
Are you responsible for this?

634
00:47:03,532 --> 00:47:06,577
We are not savages.
- Yes, General.

635
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:09,507
Has he eaten?
- I don't know, sir.

636
00:47:09,705 --> 00:47:13,084
Go get him some clothes.
- Yes, General.

637
00:47:16,379 --> 00:47:20,074
Your Honor, this is a man who heads
a large criminal organization...

638
00:47:20,174 --> 00:47:24,579
with international contacts
we can only begin to understand.

639
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:27,248
Our case against him is very strong.

640
00:47:27,348 --> 00:47:31,894
He is not a flight risk.
His flight is assured.

641
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:36,354
The people ask that Your Honor
deny bail. Thank you.

642
00:47:37,191 --> 00:47:39,260
My client is no more a flight risk...

643
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,479
than Your Honor or the able prosecutor.

644
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:43,598
He's a pillar of his community;

645
00:47:43,698 --> 00:47:47,568
a family man with a wife and child
living in La Jolla,

646
00:47:47,668 --> 00:47:50,187
the communitywhere he has made
his home for the past 20 years.

647
00:47:50,287 --> 00:47:52,177
As our defense will quickly show,

648
00:47:52,277 --> 00:47:54,179
my client is guilty of nothing more...

649
00:47:54,279 --> 00:47:57,161
than being the handy target
of an admitted criminal.

650
00:47:57,261 --> 00:48:02,116
Therefore, we ask that you release
Carl Ayala on his own recognizance.

651
00:48:02,216 --> 00:48:04,216
I'm going to deny bail.

652
00:48:35,624 --> 00:48:38,486
I appreciate you coming in
so early this morning.

653
00:48:38,586 --> 00:48:40,863
Judge Wakefield,
it's an honor to handle it.

654
00:48:40,963 --> 00:48:44,033
She's a minor. It probably would have
expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.

655
00:48:44,133 --> 00:48:49,005
Nevertheless, this is asensitive issue
for me. I'm sure you can understand.

656
00:48:49,105 --> 00:48:52,708
Like I said, open container,
P.I., misdemeanor possession.

657
00:48:52,808 --> 00:48:54,710
It's easy to make it go away.

658
00:48:54,810 --> 00:49:00,007
One thing bothers me: The kid they
dropped off had coke and heroin in him.

659
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:03,135
Serious amounts.
He's lucky he's alive.

660
00:49:03,235 --> 00:49:05,846
So I've got to ask:
What's your daughter on?

661
00:49:05,946 --> 00:49:08,241
I don't know what you mean.

662
00:49:08,337 --> 00:49:13,579
I mean... have you asked her
what kind of drugs she's tried?

663
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:19,166
No.

664
00:49:19,242 --> 00:49:22,046
I don't know.

665
00:49:22,171 --> 00:49:24,889
Is she in any kind of therapy,
professional help?

666
00:49:24,989 --> 00:49:26,075
No, no, no. No way.

667
00:49:26,175 --> 00:49:30,935
My daughter is one of
the leading students in her school.

668
00:49:33,891 --> 00:49:36,769
Well, I hope it stays that way.

669
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:47,319
Yeah, hi, it's Robert.

670
00:49:47,405 --> 00:49:51,150
I want you to clean out my schedule
for the next three days.

671
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:55,396
Because I'm tired of talking to experts
who've never left the beltway.

672
00:49:55,496 --> 00:49:58,301
It's time to see the front lines.

673
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,312
Carlos Ayala started out
in the family connection business--...

674
00:50:36,412 --> 00:50:39,671
real estate in Tijuana,
fishing boats out of Ensenada.

675
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:41,317
hydroponic strawberries.

676
00:50:41,417 --> 00:50:43,911
Then he met up with the Obregon brothers
ofthe Tijuana cartel.

677
00:50:44,011 --> 00:50:46,456
Using regression analysis,
we made a study...

678
00:50:46,556 --> 00:50:50,460
of the custom lines at the border
and calculated the odds of a search.

679
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,621
The odds are not high, and we found
variables to reduce those odds.

680
00:50:53,721 --> 00:50:56,299
So, you pay off customs officials?

681
00:50:56,399 --> 00:50:59,977
Well, you know, in Mexico...

682
00:51:00,102 --> 00:51:03,339
law enforcement is
an entrepreneurial activity.

683
00:51:03,439 --> 00:51:06,059
Not so much in the States.
Anyway, we, uh--

684
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:09,262
We hire drivers with nothing to lose and
throw a lot of product at the problem.

685
00:51:09,362 --> 00:51:12,148
Some get stopped. Enough get through.
It's not difficult.

686
00:51:12,248 --> 00:51:17,353
Look, boys, this has worked for years.
It's gonna continue to work for years.

687
00:51:17,453 --> 00:51:19,723
NAFTA makes things even
more difficult for you because...

688
00:51:19,823 --> 00:51:20,856
the border's disappearing.

689
00:51:20,956 --> 00:51:23,136
Do you realize in the next
year or two at the outside

690
00:51:23,236 --> 00:51:24,527
Mexican trucking companies...

691
00:51:24,627 --> 00:51:27,664
are gonna be able to go from the States
to Mexico and back again...

692
00:51:27,764 --> 00:51:31,674
with the same freedom
as U.P.S., D.H.L., FedEx?

693
00:51:31,771 --> 00:51:35,779
It's gonna be a free-for-all.
- What, are we on Larry King...

694
00:51:35,879 --> 00:51:36,914
or something?

695
00:51:37,014 --> 00:51:39,342
Shit.

696
00:51:39,442 --> 00:51:41,877
Tell us something we don't know, Eddie.

697
00:51:41,977 --> 00:51:45,214
You guys remind me of those Japanese
soldiers left on deserted islands...

698
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:48,050
who think World War II is still going on.

699
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:51,242
Let me be the first to tell you,
your government surrendered...

700
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:52,597
this war a long time ago.

701
00:51:52,697 --> 00:51:55,766
I don't think all this attitude
is gonna help in front of a jury.

702
00:51:55,866 --> 00:51:59,946
It's really a bad attitude.
- Very bad. Very bad.

703
00:52:00,997 --> 00:52:06,862
Look, Ed, there's only one problem
with all this math. You're in here.

704
00:52:07,837 --> 00:52:09,706
Well, I got greedy, didn't I?

705
00:52:09,806 --> 00:52:12,049
Yes, you did.
- Yeah.

706
00:52:12,174 --> 00:52:15,545
Decided to bring a little in on my own
and somebody tipped you off.

707
00:52:15,645 --> 00:52:18,080
Carl never would have been so stupid.

708
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:21,934
Well, Carl hired you.
That was a mistake.

709
00:52:24,895 --> 00:52:29,258
Carl and I have been friends
since we were little kids.

710
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:31,358
He was loyal.

711
00:52:36,073 --> 00:52:37,934
Javi.

712
00:52:38,034 --> 00:52:40,561
A group of us are going to a party.

713
00:52:40,661 --> 00:52:42,363
Who?

714
00:52:42,463 --> 00:52:47,835
Esteban, Guzmán, Tomás,
all of them.

715
00:52:48,169 --> 00:52:50,254
Your new buddies.

716
00:52:51,797 --> 00:52:53,541
Yes.

717
00:52:53,641 --> 00:52:55,284
Let's go.
- No.

718
00:52:55,384 --> 00:52:58,220
It'll be fun.
- Another day.

719
00:53:02,308 --> 00:53:05,936
At my house I have some B&W speakers.

720
00:53:06,854 --> 00:53:10,516
A while ago I bought a CD burner.

721
00:53:10,616 --> 00:53:14,487
I make CDs with the music I want.

722
00:53:15,363 --> 00:53:18,741
Just like I bought them in a store.

723
00:53:19,575 --> 00:53:23,404
You and I have a lot in common.
Not everything, but a lot.

724
00:53:23,504 --> 00:53:27,754
We both studied on the other side
with the gringos.

725
00:53:29,085 --> 00:53:31,579
Your father is an engineer, right?

726
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:36,354
My father-- may he rest in peace--
was also an engineer.

727
00:53:37,134 --> 00:53:40,959
I've been into stereos
since I was very young.

728
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:44,308
Most people don't care...

729
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:49,814
but for me it's very important.

730
00:54:00,992 --> 00:54:03,619
They say in Latin:

731
00:54:03,744 --> 00:54:07,314
In vino veritas.
Wine brings out the truth.

732
00:54:10,209 --> 00:54:13,004
Use this to write down...

733
00:54:13,963 --> 00:54:18,553
the addresses of those bastards
who killed my captains.

734
00:54:20,344 --> 00:54:24,498
And not where they were last week,
but where they are now.

735
00:54:24,598 --> 00:54:27,643
Where they are this minute.

736
00:54:27,935 --> 00:54:32,270
And better yet,
where they are going to be tomorrow.

737
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:40,195
You know where they are going
to be tomorrow, right?

738
00:55:22,198 --> 00:55:26,703
Reported by the government
news agency, Notimex (NTX):

739
00:55:27,828 --> 00:55:33,751
'Yesterday, forces of the Mexican Army,
acting on an anonymmous tip...

740
00:55:34,919 --> 00:55:41,217
joined with police to arrest members
of the Obregón brothers drug cartel.

741
00:55:42,301 --> 00:55:48,676
Head of the Federal Drug Forces, Gen.
Arturo Salazar, said in Mexico City...

742
00:55:48,755 --> 00:55:54,397
that the sweep was a crippling blow
to the Obregón brothers...

743
00:55:54,522 --> 00:56:00,069
who reportedly dominate
the narcotics trade...

744
00:56:00,194 --> 00:56:06,450
in the city of Tijuana
and the rest of Baja California state.

745
00:56:07,743 --> 00:56:14,291
General Salazar wen t on to say that
the au thorities were working overtime...

746
00:56:15,334 --> 00:56:22,383
to confirm that Porfirio Madrigal,
head of the rival Juárez cartel...

747
00:56:23,217 --> 00:56:28,097
died last week during
a plastic surgery procedure.'

748
00:56:30,391 --> 00:56:32,391
Here it is, here it is.

749
00:56:34,895 --> 00:56:36,939
Get out, asshole.

750
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:40,240
Are you going to kill me?
- No.

751
00:56:40,568 --> 00:56:43,713
No, the Obregóns will do that for us.

752
00:57:05,426 --> 00:57:07,337
The port of San Ysidro, California:

753
00:57:07,437 --> 00:57:12,027
45,000 vehicles on average,
25,000 pedestrians per day.

754
00:57:16,896 --> 00:57:19,086
In the last six months,
a threefold increase?

755
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:20,716
Increase in narcotics seizures.

756
00:57:20,816 --> 00:57:24,553
Would that mean, pro rata, three times
as much drugs is getting in?

757
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:27,815
That's a scary way to figure it,
but I believe that's true.

758
00:57:27,915 --> 00:57:31,269
In my heart, I'd love to say
that we were getting 60 or 70%.

759
00:57:31,369 --> 00:57:36,148
In the reality, we're more like 40 or
50% of the total that's approaching us.

760
00:57:36,248 --> 00:57:38,493
And it's all big-dollar issues now.

761
00:57:38,593 --> 00:57:40,495
That's the reason you're seeing
a lot of these murders taking place.

762
00:57:40,595 --> 00:57:42,905
It's one organization
fighting another organization.

763
00:57:43,005 --> 00:57:44,949
When things are good,
people don't kill each other.

764
00:57:45,049 --> 00:57:47,118
When things are bad,
when they're losing dope,

765
00:57:47,218 --> 00:57:49,120
when they're losing drivers
and guys are going to jail,

766
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:51,940
people start killing each other.

767
00:57:59,939 --> 00:58:03,776
How's David?
- 'How's David?'

768
00:58:03,901 --> 00:58:07,513
Oh, he's terrific, Carl. Terrific.
- Oh, Helena--

769
00:58:07,613 --> 00:58:09,899
He watched his father
being dragged away by federal agents.

770
00:58:09,999 --> 00:58:12,994
He's just doing fine.
- Okay.

771
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,738
I can't even begin
to tell him where you are...

772
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:18,408
and when you're coming home,
if you're ever coming home.

773
00:58:18,508 --> 00:58:22,586
Helena... we're gonna get through this.

774
00:58:22,712 --> 00:58:24,712
I promise.

775
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:27,443
I'll make it up to you.
- Do you have any idea...

776
00:58:27,543 --> 00:58:29,160
what's going on out here?

777
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:32,346
Huh? Our credit cards are maxed.

778
00:58:32,471 --> 00:58:35,939
The people in the bank--
you should see the way they...

779
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:37,710
look at me when I walk in.

780
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:39,929
I have a letter
from the government telling me...

781
00:58:40,029 --> 00:58:43,975
anything I sell from the house will be
taken against an income tax lien.

782
00:58:44,075 --> 00:58:47,194
Our fucking friends--

783
00:58:47,319 --> 00:58:50,806
Nobody will help us.
Nobody will take us in.

784
00:58:50,906 --> 00:58:53,901
Nobody wants anything to do with us, Carl.

785
00:58:54,001 --> 00:58:58,439
So, you just tell me
how you're gonna make it up to me.

786
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:01,167
Helena--

787
00:59:01,292 --> 00:59:04,287
Just tell me what to do.

788
00:59:04,387 --> 00:59:07,490
I'm not bringing a child into the life
that I was brought up into.

789
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:09,884
I won't do it, Carl.

790
00:59:10,009 --> 00:59:13,012
I want our life back.

791
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,802
Yeah, we're smarter.
We know the difference.

792
01:00:09,902 --> 01:00:13,614
Hello. Ding, ding, ding.
We have a winner.

793
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:14,836
Hi, folks.
- Hello.

794
01:00:14,936 --> 01:00:16,475
Hi. Room 310, please.

795
01:00:16,575 --> 01:00:20,773
Okay, I need to see some
I.D. s, please, and $28.

796
01:00:20,873 --> 01:00:22,873
Okay.

797
01:00:23,124 --> 01:00:25,251
Man, I love this place.

798
01:00:48,816 --> 01:00:52,603
I wish we could just stay here.

799
01:00:52,703 --> 01:00:56,607
Just be here forever and ever and...

800
01:00:56,707 --> 01:00:59,327
make a little home here.

801
01:01:10,963 --> 01:01:14,208
I want to, uh...

802
01:01:14,308 --> 01:01:19,663
I want to have sex and then do a hit
right as we're both coming.

803
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:27,519
Okay.

804
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:06,627
The first time I got laid
was on a beach just like that.

805
01:02:06,727 --> 01:02:10,181
You got a what on a beach?
- Got laid, man.

806
01:02:10,281 --> 01:02:12,996
Lost my virginity,
was a sophomore in high school.

807
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:15,901
That's cool.
- Yeah, it was sweet.

808
01:02:16,696 --> 01:02:18,696
Did he treat you good?

809
01:02:34,213 --> 01:02:36,541
Who's this guy?
- I don't know.

810
01:02:36,641 --> 01:02:41,316
I never seen him before.
- He's going right for the kid.

811
01:02:43,389 --> 01:02:45,389
David.

812
01:02:47,309 --> 01:02:49,770
David, come back here.

813
01:02:51,939 --> 01:02:53,850
Mom, Mom.
- Please, put down my son.

814
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:56,310
Shouldn't let
your kid wander off with strangers.

815
01:02:56,410 --> 01:03:00,306
Karen, if he tries to move
with that kid, you break cover.

816
01:03:00,406 --> 01:03:03,435
Mrs. Ayala, your husband owes
a lot of money. Snapping this...

817
01:03:03,535 --> 01:03:04,894
kid's neck wouldn't cover it.

818
01:03:04,994 --> 01:03:07,905
You better come up with it in a hurry
or your kid is gonna disappear,

819
01:03:08,005 --> 01:03:10,691
and he won't turn up
until the evening news.

820
01:03:10,791 --> 01:03:15,296
You get only one warning.
First payment is $3 million.

821
01:03:38,986 --> 01:03:43,032
Javier.
- Yes?

822
01:03:45,242 --> 01:03:47,242
What's up, Ana?

823
01:03:48,788 --> 01:03:51,749
Manolo never came home last night.

824
01:03:52,375 --> 01:03:54,752
Come in, come in. Sit down.

825
01:04:00,174 --> 01:04:02,510
I don't know where he is.

826
01:04:03,344 --> 01:04:05,171
He wasn't with you last night?

827
01:04:05,271 --> 01:04:07,271
No.

828
01:04:10,643 --> 01:04:12,303
I'm worried.

829
01:04:12,403 --> 01:04:15,298
Don't worry too much.
It makes you ugly.

830
01:04:15,398 --> 01:04:18,713
Do you want a coffee?
Coffee with sugar?

831
01:04:18,804 --> 01:04:20,804
No.
- No?

832
01:04:22,071 --> 01:04:24,407
Look, Javier.

833
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:29,566
I was going through his clothes
the other day.

834
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:32,289
Look what I found.

835
01:04:35,668 --> 01:04:37,668
What is it?

836
01:04:44,301 --> 01:04:48,636
What were you doing?
- I was with friends from work.

837
01:04:49,974 --> 01:04:52,727
Was Salazar there?

838
01:04:53,978 --> 01:04:56,389
No.

839
01:04:56,489 --> 01:04:59,133
The general is going
to Mexico City next week...

840
01:04:59,233 --> 01:05:02,378
and I'm not going to get left behind.

841
01:05:26,552 --> 01:05:28,287
Javier Rodriguez.

842
01:05:28,387 --> 01:05:31,624
The word is you're not
that happy in your work.

843
01:05:31,724 --> 01:05:34,477
Maybe we can help.

844
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:55,044
John, how are you?
Bob Wakefield, pleasure.

845
01:05:55,144 --> 01:05:55,940
Judge, welcome.

846
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:58,201
Good to see you. How are you?
- Long time, no see.

847
01:05:58,301 --> 01:06:00,920
EPIC is very unique.

848
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:04,874
It's a facility that has over 15
different agencies--state and local--...

849
01:06:04,974 --> 01:06:07,377
that participate in gathering intelligence...

850
01:06:07,477 --> 01:06:09,796
and making sure that information gets out...

851
01:06:09,896 --> 01:06:13,883
to people in the field that need it
to stop drug trafficking.

852
01:06:13,983 --> 01:06:18,805
From here, we have the ability
to track vessels, airplanes, boats,

853
01:06:18,905 --> 01:06:21,007
anything that carries drugs.

854
01:06:21,107 --> 01:06:23,315
When the information comes in,
we're able to check...

855
01:06:23,415 --> 01:06:24,510
with different databases...

856
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:26,512
to see if it's in the system or not.

857
01:06:26,612 --> 01:06:29,307
And would most of that energy
be focused on the two cartels?

858
01:06:29,407 --> 01:06:32,890
The Juarez, the Obregon brothers--
Are those the two that would be...

859
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:33,811
most important?

860
01:06:33,911 --> 01:06:36,522
Those are the two
clearest threats right now.

861
01:06:36,622 --> 01:06:39,283
They are the dominant force in trafficking,

862
01:06:39,383 --> 01:06:41,411
both on the Mexican side and in the U.S.

863
01:06:41,511 --> 01:06:44,622
How are the cartels achieving...

864
01:06:44,722 --> 01:06:47,950
the level of intelligence and
sophistication that they're showing?

865
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:51,004
Craig, why don't you answer that?
- An unlimited budget.

866
01:06:51,104 --> 01:06:53,664
So, you're saying, actually,
that even a country of our size...

867
01:06:53,764 --> 01:06:57,543
and the budget that we throw
towards this issue,

868
01:06:57,643 --> 01:07:00,805
they can compete at the same level?
- No, they're way beyond us.

869
01:07:00,905 --> 01:07:03,950
'Way beyond'?
- Our budgetary process...

870
01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:06,430
makes us pale in comparison.

871
01:07:07,278 --> 01:07:11,607
That house you're looking at over there
used to belong to Porfirio Madrigal.

872
01:07:11,707 --> 01:07:14,035
His nickname was Scorpion.

873
01:07:14,201 --> 01:07:16,229
I'll let you figure out what that means.

874
01:07:16,329 --> 01:07:18,823
Wasn't that the guy
who died during plastic surgery?

875
01:07:18,923 --> 01:07:21,242
Best of our information, yes.

876
01:07:21,342 --> 01:07:23,778
Who do you interact with on that side?

877
01:07:23,878 --> 01:07:26,205
Nobody.

878
01:07:26,305 --> 01:07:28,940
Well, who has my job in Mexico?

879
01:07:29,032 --> 01:07:32,687
Your position doesn't exist over there yet.

880
01:07:39,977 --> 01:07:42,680
I want everyone thinking out of the box...

881
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:44,766
for the next few minutes.

882
01:07:44,866 --> 01:07:47,501
What are we doing about Mexico?

883
01:07:47,595 --> 01:07:50,834
Come on, guys, out of the box.
- Unlimited funds?

884
01:07:50,934 --> 01:07:53,032
Unlimited.

885
01:07:53,157 --> 01:07:56,986
From a D.E.A. standpoint, we need
a vetted task force and matching funds.

886
01:07:57,086 --> 01:08:00,773
And cut the red tape on getting them
equipment and training.

887
01:08:00,873 --> 01:08:02,817
Come on, guys,
I want to hear from everyone:

888
01:08:02,917 --> 01:08:05,670
F.B.I., customs, treatment.

889
01:08:07,296 --> 01:08:08,958
Is there anybody from treatment
on this plane?

890
01:08:09,058 --> 01:08:09,407
No, Judge.

891
01:08:09,507 --> 01:08:12,577
Then, I want to know why there isn't
anybody from treatment on this plane.

892
01:08:12,677 --> 01:08:14,677
Yes, sir.

893
01:08:14,804 --> 01:08:18,791
We need to take down one of
these cartels--Juarez or Tijuana--...

894
01:08:18,891 --> 01:08:20,960
not because they're a symbol, but--

895
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:26,007
Hell, they are a symbol.
But because we need to send a message.

896
01:08:26,107 --> 01:08:29,802
When Carlos Ayala hires Michael Adler
as his legal defense.

897
01:08:29,902 --> 01:08:32,939
I send Ben Williams
down to San Diego as a prosecutor.

898
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:35,942
Why? Because it's a symbol.

899
01:08:36,042 --> 01:08:39,237
It's a symbol that we are sending the best.

900
01:08:39,337 --> 01:08:43,866
It's a message that we're
going after their top guys.

901
01:08:43,966 --> 01:08:46,494
So...

902
01:08:46,594 --> 01:08:48,621
right now...

903
01:08:48,721 --> 01:08:52,299
on this flight only...

904
01:08:52,425 --> 01:08:54,836
the dam is open...

905
01:08:54,936 --> 01:08:58,139
for new ideas.

906
01:09:08,232 --> 01:09:11,010
On a clear day,
you can see Mexico City.

907
01:09:11,110 --> 01:09:14,680
I have this place swept twice a day,
so just feel free to talk.

908
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:18,693
I learned that back in Miami in '85.

909
01:09:18,793 --> 01:09:20,853
U.S. shut down the entire Caribbean.

910
01:09:20,953 --> 01:09:24,135
It's a big game of whack-a-mole.
You knock it down in Miami--

911
01:09:24,235 --> 01:09:25,274
Arnie, I need money.

912
01:09:25,374 --> 01:09:28,661
Somebody-- I think it was the Obregons--
threatened David.

913
01:09:28,761 --> 01:09:32,040
They want a first payment of $3 million.

914
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:35,343
Oh, Helena.

915
01:09:35,468 --> 01:09:38,838
I'd give it to you myself, but I-I-I
just don't have that kind of money.

916
01:09:38,938 --> 01:09:40,840
Please. Does anyone owe us money?

917
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:45,503
Yes, there are people that do owe
you money, but nobody's gonna pay.

918
01:09:45,603 --> 01:09:48,431
Carl's got too much heat on him.

919
01:09:48,531 --> 01:09:52,718
What about our other businesses,
our legitimate businesses?

920
01:09:52,818 --> 01:09:56,731
Don't we own a construction--
- Laundromats wash the money.

921
01:09:56,831 --> 01:09:59,025
Just tell me something positive, Arnie.

922
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:01,861
Give me some good news,
for Christ's sake.

923
01:10:01,961 --> 01:10:03,961
I'm sorry.

924
01:10:08,876 --> 01:10:11,871
I just keep wondering what's
gonna happen if he doesn't get out.

925
01:10:11,971 --> 01:10:15,466
Just never been on my own before.

926
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:19,220
Always had someone. Always.

927
01:10:26,727 --> 01:10:31,732
I remember the first time that I saw you--...

928
01:10:31,857 --> 01:10:36,779
little Helen Watts
from the wrong side of somewhere.

929
01:10:36,904 --> 01:10:42,694
Somehow I knew even then that your
survival skills were pretty well honed.

930
01:10:42,794 --> 01:10:46,406
Glad you think so, Arnie.

931
01:10:46,506 --> 01:10:51,193
I just keep picturing a debt-ridden,
30-year-old mother of two...

932
01:10:51,293 --> 01:10:55,628
whose ex-husband
is being compared to Pablo Escobar.

933
01:10:57,341 --> 01:11:02,271
I don't know anyone who wants
to be with someone like that.

934
01:11:03,973 --> 01:11:04,957
Do you?

935
01:11:05,057 --> 01:11:07,057
Do you?

936
01:11:39,592 --> 01:11:42,219
You two don't like me, do you?

937
01:11:42,678 --> 01:11:46,924
Miss, with all due respect,
we don't have an opinion.

938
01:11:47,024 --> 01:11:49,168
Maybe it's because I'm going to have...

939
01:11:49,268 --> 01:11:53,422
the nicest home you've ever seen
in your miserable lives.

940
01:11:53,522 --> 01:11:56,092
The old man actually kept his promise.

941
01:11:56,192 --> 01:12:00,488
The general is a man of his word.

942
01:12:02,073 --> 01:12:05,393
They will say anything
to get what they want...

943
01:12:05,493 --> 01:12:10,657
and then it's always
tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.

944
01:12:10,757 --> 01:12:13,959
Occupational hazard, I guess.

945
01:12:37,775 --> 01:12:40,152
The bags?

946
01:12:41,153 --> 01:12:47,702
My love, it's beautiful. How beautiful.

947
01:12:47,827 --> 01:12:50,246
How are you feeling? Good?

948
01:12:51,622 --> 01:12:53,958
How handsome you are.

949
01:13:03,592 --> 01:13:05,244
Listen...

950
01:13:05,344 --> 01:13:07,722
the Scorpion is alive.

951
01:13:09,974 --> 01:13:11,974
Get in.

952
01:13:15,646 --> 01:13:19,108
Porfirio Madrigal isn't dead after all.

953
01:13:19,859 --> 01:13:24,619
That means that Salazar is working
for the Juárez cartel.

954
01:13:24,947 --> 01:13:28,602
I can't believe this doesn't matter to you.

955
01:13:29,201 --> 01:13:31,279
This is nothing new, Manolo.

956
01:13:31,379 --> 01:13:34,866
That's why Salazar is so interested
in cleaning up Tijuana.

957
01:13:34,966 --> 01:13:38,876
And he has plans for Juan Obregón,
the bastard.

958
01:13:38,952 --> 01:13:40,952
That's right.

959
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:46,127
You know how much money
he would pay for this information?

960
01:13:46,227 --> 01:13:49,627
How much?
- A fuckload of money, partner.

961
01:13:53,934 --> 01:13:58,439
What's up, man?
- Take off your glasses.

962
01:13:58,564 --> 01:14:02,304
Take off your glasses
so I can see your eyes.

963
01:14:10,868 --> 01:14:14,789
We're going to keep our mouths shut.

964
01:14:17,708 --> 01:14:19,794
Okay.

965
01:14:27,301 --> 01:14:30,338
I think we
may have found our Mexican drug czar.

966
01:14:30,438 --> 01:14:33,341
General Salazar.

967
01:14:33,441 --> 01:14:37,169
Be nice to have somebody
to workwith down there.

968
01:14:37,269 --> 01:14:40,506
Does this mean you're
gonna be gone more?

969
01:14:40,606 --> 01:14:42,858
Possibly, yeah.

970
01:14:45,069 --> 01:14:49,015
You might want to pencil in
a little face time with your daughter.

971
01:14:49,115 --> 01:14:50,622
Barbara--
- Because I'm at the edge...

972
01:14:50,722 --> 01:14:51,851
of my capabilities, Robert.

973
01:14:51,951 --> 01:14:55,113
I think it's important
we maintain a unified front.

974
01:14:55,213 --> 01:14:57,365
If you start in on the war metaphors.

975
01:14:57,465 --> 01:14:59,567
I'm gonna drive this car
into a telephone pole.

976
01:14:59,667 --> 01:15:03,237
I am as worried as you are.
- Oh, I don't think so.

977
01:15:03,337 --> 01:15:05,248
'Leave me alone.
Give me some money.'

978
01:15:05,348 --> 01:15:07,667
That's what I get from our daughter.

979
01:15:07,767 --> 01:15:11,337
She has a way of shutting me out
that seems very familiar.

980
01:15:11,437 --> 01:15:17,897
Well, she has a way of self-medicating
that I'm sure is very familiar to you.

981
01:15:18,728 --> 01:15:20,755
I'm not the one who has
to have three scotches...

982
01:15:20,855 --> 01:15:22,765
just to walk in the house and say hello.

983
01:15:22,865 --> 01:15:26,093
I have one drink before dinner
to take the edge off. It's different.

984
01:15:26,193 --> 01:15:30,528
Oh, is it?
- Otherwise, I would be dying of boredom.

985
01:15:47,131 --> 01:15:52,231
Why don't you go in and tell
your daughter how bored you are?

986
01:16:47,441 --> 01:16:50,653
Caroline, open this door immediately.

987
01:16:50,778 --> 01:16:53,940
Who is it?
I'm going to the bathroom.

988
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:57,015
Open the goddamn door.
- One minute.

989
01:17:03,457 --> 01:17:06,007
Excuse me.
I have to go to bed.

990
01:17:08,879 --> 01:17:11,424
Oh, Jesus.

991
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:18,881
You are not going anywhere, young lady.

992
01:17:18,981 --> 01:17:22,184
You stay right there.

993
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:29,940
Where are they?

994
01:17:31,152 --> 01:17:33,062
Where the hell are the drugs?

995
01:17:33,162 --> 01:17:35,197
Where are they?

996
01:17:35,322 --> 01:17:37,322
Fuck you.

997
01:17:37,408 --> 01:17:39,408
Fuck you.

998
01:17:39,463 --> 01:17:43,543
I wasn't doing anything.
You're like the Gestapo.

999
01:17:43,664 --> 01:17:48,127
Fuck me. Fuck me.
Well, fuck you.

1000
01:18:37,635 --> 01:18:39,912
Javier, good to see you.
- How you doing, partner?

1001
01:18:40,012 --> 01:18:43,124
Did you take the precautions
we discussed about being followed?

1002
01:18:43,224 --> 01:18:45,459
Yes, of course.
- Will you move to the middle, please?

1003
01:18:45,559 --> 01:18:47,470
You're not carrying a weapon?
- No.

1004
01:18:47,570 --> 01:18:49,972
Of course not.
- Where are you taking me?

1005
01:18:50,072 --> 01:18:52,975
Somewhere safe.
- Where?

1006
01:18:53,075 --> 01:18:55,770
A place we have that we know
is protected. He's good. Let's go.

1007
01:18:55,870 --> 01:18:58,064
No, no. No, no, no.
- Don't worry. It's really safe.

1008
01:18:58,164 --> 01:19:00,892
No, no, no, no, no.
This is safe. This is safe.

1009
01:19:00,992 --> 01:19:03,477
Come on, Javier, close the door.
Everything is cool, all right?

1010
01:19:03,577 --> 01:19:06,288
This is safe.
- Come on.

1011
01:19:06,455 --> 01:19:08,825
Allright.

1012
01:19:08,925 --> 01:19:11,452
Where would you like to go?

1013
01:19:11,552 --> 01:19:14,880
Huh?
- Where do you want to go, Javier?

1014
01:19:23,889 --> 01:19:28,561
I believe it's
important that we work together.

1015
01:19:28,686 --> 01:19:32,340
Mexico and the United States.
One hand washing the other.

1016
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:35,309
We agree.

1017
01:19:35,409 --> 01:19:40,934
So, maybe you can tell me
about your informants in our operations.

1018
01:19:41,157 --> 01:19:46,020
We thought that maybe you'd have
that kind of information for us.

1019
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:50,199
This is a very different
proposition, my friend.

1020
01:19:50,299 --> 01:19:53,377
We pay for that kind of information.

1021
01:19:53,502 --> 01:19:57,072
Is that what you're talking about, Javier?

1022
01:19:57,154 --> 01:19:59,216
Getting paid?

1023
01:20:02,636 --> 01:20:04,636
You like baseball?

1024
01:20:07,391 --> 01:20:12,897
We need lights for the parks
so kids can play at night.

1025
01:20:14,148 --> 01:20:16,559
So it's safe.

1026
01:20:16,659 --> 01:20:19,687
So they can play baseball.

1027
01:20:19,787 --> 01:20:22,774
So they no become--

1028
01:20:22,874 --> 01:20:24,776
Everybody like baseball.

1029
01:20:24,876 --> 01:20:27,820
Everybody likes parks.

1030
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:31,332
Listen.

1031
01:20:31,457 --> 01:20:35,411
I believe it's important that
the United State take an interest...

1032
01:20:35,511 --> 01:20:37,588
in Tijuana now.

1033
01:20:39,674 --> 01:20:43,177
That's what I'm talking about,
my friends.

1034
01:20:43,678 --> 01:20:45,721
Accountnumber...

1035
01:20:45,888 --> 01:20:50,935
8201-4302-8091...

1036
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:53,270
2431.

1037
01:20:55,064 --> 01:20:57,108
A cash advance.

1038
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:05,658
How much can I get?

1039
01:21:08,077 --> 01:21:10,077
That's it?

1040
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,119
You ever try the patch, man?

1041
01:21:16,219 --> 01:21:18,219
The what?
- The patch.

1042
01:21:18,295 --> 01:21:21,958
That shit doesn't work, bro.
- It worked for my cousin.

1043
01:21:22,058 --> 01:21:24,940
No shit?
- Yeah.

1044
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,622
He had to wear five or six
at a time, but it worked.

1045
01:21:27,722 --> 01:21:31,037
So, how's he doing now?
- Oh, he's dead.

1046
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,721
He's dead?
- It wasn't from the patch, man.

1047
01:21:34,821 --> 01:21:37,456
Okay, she's coming out.
- On it.

1048
01:21:37,565 --> 01:21:40,476
What did he die from?
- His wife shot him.

1049
01:21:40,576 --> 01:21:44,196
She's leaving her property.

1050
01:21:44,321 --> 01:21:46,307
Where the hell is she going?

1051
01:21:46,407 --> 01:21:48,407
Maybe her neighbors.

1052
01:21:48,490 --> 01:21:50,941
No, I don't think the neighbors
are fucking with her too much...

1053
01:21:51,041 --> 01:21:51,687
right about now.

1054
01:21:51,787 --> 01:21:54,932
What does she have in her hand there?

1055
01:21:55,791 --> 01:22:00,338
She seems to be headed for the van.

1056
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,760
Oh, shit.

1057
01:22:07,838 --> 01:22:11,832
What-- Wh-What do we do?
- I-l don't know. What do we do?

1058
01:22:11,932 --> 01:22:13,793
What do you think she wants, man?
- She's your girlfriend.

1059
01:22:13,893 --> 01:22:15,887
You think she'll invite you
to her baby shower?

1060
01:22:15,987 --> 01:22:17,889
Just say hello. Work it.
- All right, all right, all right.

1061
01:22:17,989 --> 01:22:20,216
She's waiting outside the van.

1062
01:22:20,316 --> 01:22:22,885
Hello?
- Would you like some lemonade?

1063
01:22:22,985 --> 01:22:27,065
I was just making some.
- You want some lemonade?

1064
01:22:27,163 --> 01:22:29,163
Sure.

1065
01:22:29,237 --> 01:22:33,396
I knowt his is a difficult situation,
and you're only doing your jobs.

1066
01:22:33,496 --> 01:22:36,908
I don't wish you guys
any ill will or anything like that.

1067
01:22:37,008 --> 01:22:39,151
But I have a favor to ask you.

1068
01:22:39,251 --> 01:22:41,404
You're asking us for a favor?

1069
01:22:41,504 --> 01:22:43,739
Some man threatened my child.

1070
01:22:43,839 --> 01:22:45,750
These charges have created
so much attention,

1071
01:22:45,850 --> 01:22:49,912
it seems to be bringing
all the nutjobs out of the nutjar.

1072
01:22:50,012 --> 01:22:54,000
Would you keep an eye out
for anything out of the ordinary?

1073
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:56,427
Sure.
- Yeah, of course we will.

1074
01:22:56,527 --> 01:22:59,088
I'd really appreciate it.
- Sure.

1075
01:22:59,188 --> 01:23:01,799
Thanks.
- Thank you for the lemonade.

1076
01:23:01,899 --> 01:23:04,276
You're welcome.

1077
01:23:10,866 --> 01:23:14,606
I'm gonna get this analyzed right away, bro.

1078
01:23:17,123 --> 01:23:20,118
So, it was my birthday...

1079
01:23:20,218 --> 01:23:23,079
and my ex-wife was getting remarried...

1080
01:23:23,179 --> 01:23:26,124
and I was in some church basement
telling a bunch of strangers...

1081
01:23:26,224 --> 01:23:28,200
it was a good day because...

1082
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:31,615
I didn't have to eat out of a Dumpster.

1083
01:23:32,054 --> 01:23:34,966
That was enough to send me
out on a pretty big one.

1084
01:23:35,066 --> 01:23:38,469
I've been thinking a lot
about the first step--...

1085
01:23:38,569 --> 01:23:42,298
that I came to believe
I was powerless over alcohol...

1086
01:23:42,398 --> 01:23:44,467
and that my life
had become unmanageable.

1087
01:23:44,567 --> 01:23:47,979
My disease tells me
that I don't have a disease,

1088
01:23:48,079 --> 01:23:50,640
that it's my birthday
and I can have one little beer,

1089
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:54,410
one little line,
a little Valium.

1090
01:23:54,577 --> 01:23:59,190
Six months later, I wake up
in a sober-living house in Philly.

1091
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:01,792
I'm from Dallas, people.

1092
01:24:01,917 --> 01:24:05,463
It's a disease,
an allergy of the body,

1093
01:24:05,588 --> 01:24:08,020
an obsession of the mind.

1094
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:10,301
So, my name is Marty,

1095
01:24:10,426 --> 01:24:14,472
and today I'm a grateful,
recovering alcoholic.

1096
01:24:14,597 --> 01:24:19,669
And it's a good day because I
didn't have to eat out of a Dumpster.

1097
01:24:19,769 --> 01:24:21,769
Thanks.

1098
01:24:24,106 --> 01:24:26,317
Hi.

1099
01:24:27,777 --> 01:24:32,323
I'm Caroline.
I'm not sure I'm an alcoholic.

1100
01:24:32,448 --> 01:24:36,994
I mean...
I don't really like to drink.

1101
01:24:38,788 --> 01:24:45,248
For someone my age, it's a lot easier
to get drugs than it is to get alcohol.

1102
01:24:48,464 --> 01:24:51,884
I guess I'm angry.

1103
01:24:55,304 --> 01:24:58,916
I mean, I think I'm really angry
about a lot of stuff.

1104
01:24:59,016 --> 01:25:02,937
I'm just... not sure what.

1105
01:25:50,109 --> 01:25:52,437
Listen to me.
I built our house...

1106
01:25:52,537 --> 01:25:54,747
and I'm not gonna lose it.

1107
01:25:57,658 --> 01:25:59,658
My business--...

1108
01:25:59,734 --> 01:26:04,957
that would take a lot of private study.

1109
01:26:10,755 --> 01:26:14,751
I suggest...
you look into the Coronel.

1110
01:26:14,851 --> 01:26:19,597
The painting?
- Into selling it.

1111
01:26:19,722 --> 01:26:21,849
If you can stomach it,

1112
01:26:22,016 --> 01:26:25,644
you should look into it.

1113
01:27:11,315 --> 01:27:13,315
Oh, my God.

1114
01:28:09,874 --> 01:28:12,827
Dear Judge.

1115
01:28:12,927 --> 01:28:16,873
I recruited the best men
in Mexico for my task force.

1116
01:28:16,973 --> 01:28:22,253
I make the selection, putting them
under a rigorous screening process.

1117
01:28:22,353 --> 01:28:26,883
And not only physically,
but also psychologically.

1118
01:28:26,983 --> 01:28:31,054
Judge, I'm sorry for boxes
and the paintings and things,

1119
01:28:31,154 --> 01:28:35,341
but I have been too busy
to completely settle in here.

1120
01:28:35,441 --> 01:28:38,135
I know you've made very good progress
with the Tijuana cartel.

1121
01:28:38,235 --> 01:28:40,429
Congratulations, General.
- Muchas gracias.

1122
01:28:40,529 --> 01:28:44,734
I am confident
that before the end of the year.

1123
01:28:44,834 --> 01:28:48,112
Juan Obregon is gonna
be taken into custody.

1124
01:28:48,212 --> 01:28:52,984
But you must understand that it's
going to be a very difficult task...

1125
01:28:53,084 --> 01:28:56,737
because of the corruption
in the police force.

1126
01:28:56,837 --> 01:29:00,166
Hopefully, the exchange
of training methods and information...

1127
01:29:00,266 --> 01:29:02,535
between our two countries will help.

1128
01:29:02,635 --> 01:29:04,796
I hope so.

1129
01:29:04,896 --> 01:29:08,737
On another note, General,
we were talking about supply.

1130
01:29:08,837 --> 01:29:11,636
Mm-hmm.
- What about demand?

1131
01:29:11,736 --> 01:29:14,714
What are your policies
towards treatment of addiction?

1132
01:29:14,814 --> 01:29:17,975
'Treatment of addiction.'

1133
01:29:18,075 --> 01:29:20,319
Addicts treat themselves.

1134
01:29:20,444 --> 01:29:25,119
They overdose, and then there's
one less to worry about.

1135
01:29:30,287 --> 01:29:34,951
What I want you to do right now
is write down five triggers...

1136
01:29:35,051 --> 01:29:37,194
that could lead to your relapse,

1137
01:29:37,294 --> 01:29:39,706
that could jeopardize your recovery.

1138
01:29:39,806 --> 01:29:44,711
Five triggers.
Your parents, something they could say.

1139
01:29:44,811 --> 01:29:47,672
Anything that's a trigger for you.
It varies from person to person.

1140
01:29:47,772 --> 01:29:52,176
Some of us have already discussed--

1141
01:29:52,276 --> 01:29:54,378
Linda, we talked about it the other day.

1142
01:29:54,478 --> 01:29:56,389
I know you have trouble with your sister,

1143
01:29:56,489 --> 01:30:00,317
how she's always kind of outshining you.

1144
01:30:09,076 --> 01:30:12,901
Hey, sugarfoot,
how do you like your new home?

1145
01:30:14,957 --> 01:30:18,945
You got to be kidding me.
This is not what my lawyers negotiated.

1146
01:30:19,045 --> 01:30:20,988
Please. Fuck your lawyers.

1147
01:30:21,088 --> 01:30:23,783
You're not getting
any goddamn cappuccino or--...

1148
01:30:23,883 --> 01:30:25,509
Biscotti.
- Yeah, you ain't getting...

1149
01:30:25,609 --> 01:30:26,786
none of that shit either.

1150
01:30:26,886 --> 01:30:28,955
Pick a bed.
- Stay off the phone, Eddie.

1151
01:30:29,055 --> 01:30:31,007
No long-distance calls, all right?

1152
01:30:31,107 --> 01:30:34,185
Use 1-800-CRIMINAL if you do.

1153
01:30:42,401 --> 01:30:45,396
Mr. Ayala first came to see me in January.

1154
01:30:45,496 --> 01:30:48,616
That would have been 1987.

1155
01:30:48,741 --> 01:30:52,070
He wanted to rent warehouse space
along the harbor.

1156
01:30:52,170 --> 01:30:56,357
I didn't ask too many questions.
I am a businessman also.

1157
01:30:56,457 --> 01:31:00,961
I was the company's secretary
from 1991 to 1994.

1158
01:31:01,087 --> 01:31:05,324
I supposedly worked for all
six companies, but they weren't--

1159
01:31:05,424 --> 01:31:09,662
I mean, it was just an empty office
with a desk and a telephone.

1160
01:31:09,762 --> 01:31:12,707
I never sold anything
the whole time I was there.

1161
01:31:12,807 --> 01:31:16,094
Sometimes people came in,
and they got paid.

1162
01:31:16,194 --> 01:31:19,005
I-I don't really know what they did.

1163
01:31:19,105 --> 01:31:23,508
Didn't Mr. Ayala
say where the money came from?

1164
01:31:23,608 --> 01:31:23,851
No.

1165
01:31:23,951 --> 01:31:28,989
Did you ask where the money came from?
- No.

1166
01:31:29,115 --> 01:31:31,183
Where do you think it came from?

1167
01:31:31,283 --> 01:31:33,653
Objection. Speculation.
- Sustained.

1168
01:31:33,753 --> 01:31:36,163
I'll rephrase, Your Honor.

1169
01:31:36,288 --> 01:31:41,473
Did you feel like you were engaged
in a legitimate enterprise?

1170
01:31:43,004 --> 01:31:46,048
No, not really.

1171
01:31:48,759 --> 01:31:50,759
Thank you.

1172
01:32:17,538 --> 01:32:20,258
You were followed by the police,

1173
01:32:20,374 --> 01:32:25,171
but they won't be able
to hear us over the children.

1174
01:32:27,256 --> 01:32:30,718
I want to use a bomb.

1175
01:32:34,055 --> 01:32:36,098
Are you kidding?

1176
01:32:36,223 --> 01:32:39,453
Can't you just shoot him or something?

1177
01:32:40,519 --> 01:32:42,730
I don't really like guns.

1178
01:32:42,855 --> 01:32:45,258
You shoot somebody in the head
two, three times...

1179
01:32:45,358 --> 01:32:50,071
and some pinche doctor
is trying to keep him alive.

1180
01:32:52,073 --> 01:32:55,076
When are you gonna do it?

1181
01:32:55,201 --> 01:32:57,201
I don't know.

1182
01:32:59,747 --> 01:33:04,369
Eduardo Ruiz is the only
real witness against Carl.

1183
01:33:04,469 --> 01:33:06,849
Security will be very tight.

1184
01:33:08,714 --> 01:33:14,069
I may not be able to get to him.
- You'll be able to get to him.

1185
01:33:14,163 --> 01:33:17,535
If they can get to
the pope and the president.

1186
01:33:17,635 --> 01:33:19,792
you can certainly get to him.

1187
01:33:19,892 --> 01:33:25,247
Careful. You're starting to sound
like your husband, Mrs. Ayala.

1188
01:33:45,626 --> 01:33:48,963
Nobody saw her leave?

1189
01:33:49,088 --> 01:33:51,507
Hmm.

1190
01:33:51,632 --> 01:33:53,968
No, I understand.

1191
01:33:54,135 --> 01:33:56,637
Okay.

1192
01:33:59,682 --> 01:34:02,184
I gotta go.

1193
01:34:02,309 --> 01:34:05,179
I've got to go home.

1194
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:08,190
Did you want me to resch--

1195
01:34:08,315 --> 01:34:10,818
Fine.

1196
01:34:24,165 --> 01:34:27,585
What's going on? You seem nervous.

1197
01:34:27,710 --> 01:34:29,912
Because of Manolo.

1198
01:34:30,012 --> 01:34:33,374
I'm afraid he'll do something foolish
and it's going to get him killed.

1199
01:34:33,474 --> 01:34:34,917
Why?

1200
01:34:35,017 --> 01:34:37,962
He says he's going
to sell information to the DEA.

1201
01:34:38,062 --> 01:34:41,462
They're going to pay him a lot of money.

1202
01:34:43,601 --> 01:34:46,520
What could he tell the DEA?

1203
01:34:46,979 --> 01:34:48,598
You know...

1204
01:34:48,698 --> 01:34:50,993
about Salazar and Madrigal.

1205
01:35:00,034 --> 01:35:02,034
Javier.

1206
01:35:05,414 --> 01:35:07,541
Where is he right now?

1207
01:35:08,584 --> 01:35:12,630
I don't know.
He took his passport and left.

1208
01:35:17,093 --> 01:35:19,420
Give me a kiss.

1209
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:20,621
Don't tell him that I told you.

1210
01:35:20,721 --> 01:35:22,721
No.

1211
01:35:52,378 --> 01:35:56,132
What you want? Pot? Rock?
Hey, what you want?

1212
01:36:44,805 --> 01:36:48,017
Fuck.

1213
01:37:04,492 --> 01:37:07,036
What the fuck do you want?

1214
01:37:35,856 --> 01:37:37,856
Yeah.

1215
01:39:52,535 --> 01:39:56,063
It has come to our attention that
Your Honor, while in private practice,

1216
01:39:56,163 --> 01:39:58,441
previously represented
the town of Seal Beach...

1217
01:39:58,541 --> 01:40:01,444
in their stop-work suit against
the police department of Seal Beach.

1218
01:40:01,544 --> 01:40:04,071
We believe this disqualifies you
from hearing this case,

1219
01:40:04,171 --> 01:40:08,159
and we, therefore, move for a temporary
suspension until it's investigated.

1220
01:40:08,259 --> 01:40:10,411
Mr. Adler, this is a most unusual motion.

1221
01:40:10,511 --> 01:40:12,422
Nonetheless, Your Honor,

1222
01:40:12,522 --> 01:40:15,750
we feel our client deserves
every fairness afforded under the law.

1223
01:40:15,850 --> 01:40:22,310
I hope this is not in anyway designed
to delay the testimony of Eduardo Ruiz.

1224
01:40:25,526 --> 01:40:28,229
We will recess until 9:00 a.m.
on Monday morning,

1225
01:40:28,329 --> 01:40:32,366
and I will see counsel in my chambers.

1226
01:40:49,050 --> 01:40:51,469
They are coming this way.

1227
01:40:54,847 --> 01:40:57,558
All of them are there.

1228
01:40:57,683 --> 01:41:00,394
They are passing me now.

1229
01:41:06,275 --> 01:41:09,228
Boy, there's a lot of them.

1230
01:41:09,328 --> 01:41:14,150
Listen, would you mind if we
walked back to the hotel today?

1231
01:41:14,250 --> 01:41:16,994
Walk back?
- Yeah.

1232
01:41:20,956 --> 01:41:23,761
They're not getting into the car.

1233
01:41:24,627 --> 01:41:26,954
What are they doing?

1234
01:41:27,054 --> 01:41:29,519
They're arguing or something.

1235
01:41:32,176 --> 01:41:34,537
It's two blocks.
I could use the fresh air.

1236
01:41:34,637 --> 01:41:37,081
I've been stuck in that piece of shit
hotel room for two weeks.

1237
01:41:37,181 --> 01:41:39,780
I don't give a fuck.
Let's just stop standing around.

1238
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:41,687
I want to walk 'cause I want to walk,
not 'cause he wants to walk.

1239
01:41:41,787 --> 01:41:42,044
Let's walk.

1240
01:41:42,144 --> 01:41:44,609
I like that.
Okay, we'll walk.

1241
01:41:47,024 --> 01:41:49,276
They're going past me.

1242
01:41:52,988 --> 01:41:57,443
I-I-I do not know. I think
they're going back to the courthouse.

1243
01:41:57,543 --> 01:42:02,417
This could be the last chance
to do this. Get out of the car...

1244
01:42:02,517 --> 01:42:04,768
and shoot him in the head.

1245
01:42:21,767 --> 01:42:23,753
You're a fucking big man?

1246
01:42:23,853 --> 01:42:30,568
I'm a real fucking man. I don't fucking
deal drugs to little fucking kids, you--

1247
01:42:32,820 --> 01:42:34,388
Fucking rat.

1248
01:42:34,488 --> 01:42:38,058
You think you're a badass?
- I am a badass.

1249
01:42:39,368 --> 01:42:42,997
Move, move. Get down.

1250
01:42:50,629 --> 01:42:53,360
Go, go, go.
We need an ambulance.

1251
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:55,460
Go, go, go.

1252
01:43:22,244 --> 01:43:25,049
Ray. Ray. Ray.
Wait a minute, Ray.

1253
01:44:12,294 --> 01:44:14,759
Manolito, Manolito, Manolito.

1254
01:44:15,047 --> 01:44:17,174
What's up, Manolo?

1255
01:44:19,176 --> 01:44:21,871
Looks like you're waiting for someone.

1256
01:44:21,971 --> 01:44:24,582
I'm just looking for the waitress.

1257
01:44:24,682 --> 01:44:27,001
I'm ready to order.
Do you want anything?

1258
01:44:27,101 --> 01:44:29,962
A fucking salad?
Something to drink?

1259
01:44:30,062 --> 01:44:33,016
No, no. Calm down, calm down.

1260
01:44:33,116 --> 01:44:37,069
What are you gonna have, Manolito?

1261
01:44:39,822 --> 01:44:41,866
A steak.

1262
01:44:43,909 --> 01:44:46,119
Well, if you like steak...

1263
01:44:46,195 --> 01:44:48,664
we know a much better place.

1264
01:44:48,998 --> 01:44:51,417
You come with us.

1265
01:45:19,737 --> 01:45:22,712
Javier had nothing to do with this.

1266
01:45:23,949 --> 01:45:26,452
It was all my idea.

1267
01:45:29,622 --> 01:45:32,041
Punish me, not him.

1268
01:45:36,796 --> 01:45:39,256
Do me a favor.

1269
01:45:42,468 --> 01:45:45,188
Don't tell Ana I died like this.

1270
01:45:47,014 --> 01:45:50,559
Tell her it was something else.

1271
01:45:51,936 --> 01:45:54,563
Something official.

1272
01:45:59,777 --> 01:46:03,092
Tell her I died doing something worthy.

1273
01:46:05,616 --> 01:46:07,868
Forgive me, Javi.

1274
01:46:15,334 --> 01:46:17,753
Put some muscle into it.

1275
01:46:18,838 --> 01:46:20,881
You too, Manolo.

1276
01:46:28,389 --> 01:46:30,717
You're done.

1277
01:46:30,817 --> 01:46:32,719
Get out of there.
- Don't you hear?

1278
01:46:32,819 --> 01:46:36,147
Javier, put the shovel down.

1279
01:46:37,732 --> 01:46:40,401
Get out. Let's go.

1280
01:46:41,902 --> 01:46:44,537
I told you it wasn't his fault.

1281
01:46:44,613 --> 01:46:46,613
Shut up.

1282
01:46:50,745 --> 01:46:52,913
Turn around.

1283
01:47:08,471 --> 01:47:10,851
Let's go, Javier. It's over.

1284
01:47:27,281 --> 01:47:30,534
Don't be alarmed, Javier.

1285
01:47:30,701 --> 01:47:33,081
The old man works like this.

1286
01:47:33,166 --> 01:47:36,226
We had to go through the same thing.

1287
01:47:37,958 --> 01:47:41,779
We had to do this
to be sure we could trust you.

1288
01:47:41,879 --> 01:47:43,881
Now we see that we can.

1289
01:47:44,006 --> 01:47:46,759
We are family now.

1290
01:48:49,488 --> 01:48:51,868
Sorry about the other night.

1291
01:48:53,784 --> 01:48:55,784
Me too.

1292
01:51:03,873 --> 01:51:09,654
Thank you for coming down here, though I
suspect it has been a pointless journey.

1293
01:51:09,754 --> 01:51:13,708
Why would you say that?
- Bueno, pues, I hear these stories.

1294
01:51:13,808 --> 01:51:17,128
Your husband in jail,
his business in chaos,

1295
01:51:17,228 --> 01:51:20,414
various people fighting over the scraps.

1296
01:51:20,514 --> 01:51:24,260
My husband was a victim of an informer
in your organization, not in ours.

1297
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:26,937
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.

1298
01:51:27,104 --> 01:51:29,857
Your route has been compromised.

1299
01:51:30,024 --> 01:51:33,386
Perhaps it is time for me to deal
with other distributors in California.

1300
01:51:33,486 --> 01:51:35,638
I don't think you're gonna do that.
- You don't?

1301
01:51:35,738 --> 01:51:38,449
No.

1302
01:51:38,574 --> 01:51:43,354
My husband was working on something
he called the Project for the Children.

1303
01:51:43,454 --> 01:51:46,599
Are you aware of this?
- I don't know.

1304
01:51:46,689 --> 01:51:49,293
Perhaps I remember something.

1305
01:51:52,797 --> 01:51:57,368
If you want to smuggle narcotics
in Senor Espastico Jacobo,

1306
01:51:57,468 --> 01:51:59,671
that is nothing new, Senora.

1307
01:51:59,771 --> 01:52:03,508
No, not in.
The doll is cocaine.

1308
01:52:03,608 --> 01:52:07,520
High impact,
pressure-molded cocaine.

1309
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:12,508
It's odorless,
undetectable by the dogs.

1310
01:52:12,608 --> 01:52:15,520
Undetectable by anyone.

1311
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:18,000
I don't believe you, senora.

1312
01:52:42,096 --> 01:52:44,765
I'm six months pregnant.

1313
01:52:44,890 --> 01:52:46,890
I won't do it.

1314
01:52:46,968 --> 01:52:50,368
Then we don't have a deal.
- Yeah, right.

1315
01:52:50,414 --> 01:52:52,732
We don't have a deal.

1316
01:52:53,899 --> 01:52:57,403
Sorry to waste your time,
Mr. Obregon.

1317
01:52:59,030 --> 01:53:01,030
Okay.

1318
01:53:01,108 --> 01:53:03,108
Okay, okay.

1319
01:53:12,168 --> 01:53:15,908
That's good coke.
- It should be. It's yours.

1320
01:53:17,465 --> 01:53:19,367
I want our debt forgiven.

1321
01:53:19,467 --> 01:53:22,381
I want to be the exclusive
distributor of Obregon brothers'

1322
01:53:22,481 --> 01:53:23,913
cocaine in the United States,

1323
01:53:24,013 --> 01:53:30,218
and I want the principal witness against
my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.

1324
01:53:35,691 --> 01:53:40,281
Have you told the complete truth
during this interview?

1325
01:53:40,905 --> 01:53:43,616
Yes.

1326
01:53:44,825 --> 01:53:47,445
Alex?
- Solid.

1327
01:53:47,545 --> 01:53:49,989
That's good shit, Javier.
- You know, Javier,

1328
01:53:50,089 --> 01:53:52,617
they dump those cell phones
every 24 hours.

1329
01:53:52,717 --> 01:53:56,253
Yes, but I have a contact at MexTel...

1330
01:53:56,420 --> 01:54:00,625
who can get me his new E.S.N. in 12 hours.

1331
01:54:00,725 --> 01:54:02,725
That's good to know.

1332
01:54:06,764 --> 01:54:09,676
So, now that you have what you want,

1333
01:54:09,776 --> 01:54:13,091
let's talk about how I get what I want.

1334
01:54:13,170 --> 01:54:15,339
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.

1335
01:54:15,439 --> 01:54:18,175
You're not gonna have any problems there.

1336
01:54:18,275 --> 01:54:21,141
Yeah, but first let's talk
about what precautions you're...

1337
01:54:21,241 --> 01:54:22,597
taking to protect yourself.

1338
01:54:22,697 --> 01:54:26,659
You worry about getting me what I want.

1339
01:54:26,826 --> 01:54:29,203
I'll worry about myself.

1340
01:54:33,874 --> 01:54:38,337
Oye, Javier,
you should feel good about this.

1341
01:54:41,632 --> 01:54:44,051
I feel like a traitor.

1342
01:56:10,221 --> 01:56:14,458
Helena Ayala just left Club Platinum,
the Obregon brothers' place in Tijuana.

1343
01:56:14,558 --> 01:56:16,627
Yeah?
- She got stopped at the border.

1344
01:56:16,727 --> 01:56:21,140
She was clean,
and she's back in San Diego now.

1345
01:56:21,240 --> 01:56:23,240
Okay.

1346
01:56:33,411 --> 01:56:37,123
Hello?
- Robert, it's Jeff Sheridan.

1347
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:39,525
D-Did I wake you? I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

1348
01:56:39,625 --> 01:56:41,661
General Salazar has been arrested.

1349
01:56:41,761 --> 01:56:44,196
It turns out he has been working
for Porfirio Madrigal...

1350
01:56:44,296 --> 01:56:46,365
and the Juarez cartel the entire time.

1351
01:56:46,465 --> 01:56:49,660
That is why he was trying to push
the Obregons out of Tijuana...

1352
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:52,038
so he and Madrigal could move in.
- What?

1353
01:56:52,138 --> 01:56:55,091
I thought Madrigal was dead.
I thought that had been verified.

1354
01:56:55,191 --> 01:56:58,506
Apparently not. It is a shitstorm here,

1355
01:56:58,605 --> 01:57:02,673
but the D.E.A. supplied the information
and was part of the sting.

1356
01:57:02,773 --> 01:57:06,185
So, maybe we can spin this a little,
but I don't know what to tell people.

1357
01:57:06,285 --> 01:57:09,513
So, when are you coming back?
- I'll try to get there as soon as I can.

1358
01:57:09,613 --> 01:57:11,866
Yeah, okay, but--
- Robert.

1359
01:57:11,991 --> 01:57:16,362
Robert? Robert?

1360
01:57:16,462 --> 01:57:18,706
I gotta call you back.

1361
01:57:18,831 --> 01:57:20,831
What--...

1362
01:57:25,338 --> 01:57:30,384
My Leica's missing.
- She got the video camera too.

1363
01:57:30,509 --> 01:57:33,546
At least we know she's still alive.
Where are you going?

1364
01:57:33,646 --> 01:57:37,708
Pawn shops open in an hour. Ten minutes
after that, she'll be at her dealer.

1365
01:57:37,808 --> 01:57:41,803
If I can find him,
I should be able to find her.

1366
01:57:51,113 --> 01:57:55,201
Although ser and estar both mean 'to be,'

1367
01:57:55,326 --> 01:57:59,197
they have very specific uses.

1368
01:57:59,297 --> 01:58:02,249
May I help you, sir?

1369
01:58:07,088 --> 01:58:08,906
Excuse me.

1370
01:58:09,006 --> 01:58:13,256
Seth has to be excused.
He's going on a field trip.

1371
01:58:18,557 --> 01:58:23,062
I can't believe you brought
my daughter to this place.

1372
01:58:24,021 --> 01:58:28,734
Whoa, whoa. Why don't you just
back the fuck up, man?

1373
01:58:28,859 --> 01:58:30,945
'To this place'?

1374
01:58:31,070 --> 01:58:33,272
What is that shit?

1375
01:58:33,372 --> 01:58:36,275
Okay, right now, all over
this great nation of ours,

1376
01:58:36,375 --> 01:58:39,112
100,000 white people from the suburbs
are cruising around downtown...

1377
01:58:39,212 --> 01:58:41,584
asking every black person,
'You got any drugs? You know...

1378
01:58:41,684 --> 01:58:42,982
where I can score some drugs?'

1379
01:58:43,082 --> 01:58:45,938
Think about the effect that has
on the psyche of a black person.

1380
01:58:46,038 --> 01:58:46,944
on their possibilities.

1381
01:58:47,044 --> 01:58:49,796
I-- God, I guarantee you,
you bring 100,000 black people...

1382
01:58:49,896 --> 01:58:51,073
into your neighborhood,

1383
01:58:51,173 --> 01:58:53,926
and they're asking every white
person, 'You got any drugs?

1384
01:58:54,026 --> 01:58:55,494
Know where I can score some?'

1385
01:58:55,594 --> 01:58:59,790
Within a day, everyone would be
selling--your friends, their kids.

1386
01:58:59,890 --> 01:59:03,636
Here's why: It's an unbeatable market
force, man. It's a 300% markup value.

1387
01:59:03,736 --> 01:59:06,576
You can go out on the street
and make $500 in two hours,

1388
01:59:06,676 --> 01:59:08,641
come back and do whatever you want
with the rest of your day.

1389
01:59:08,741 --> 01:59:14,691
You're telling me that white people
would still be going to law school?

1390
01:59:38,137 --> 01:59:41,341
What do you want?
- I'm looking for my daughter.

1391
01:59:41,441 --> 01:59:43,441
Caroline.

1392
01:59:43,517 --> 01:59:45,845
She's been here.

1393
01:59:45,945 --> 01:59:48,047
This is a business, man.
Why don't you get the fuck out ofhere?

1394
01:59:48,147 --> 01:59:52,482
I need to find my daughter, all right?
I'll pay you.

1395
01:59:53,152 --> 01:59:56,364
All right.
Okay. Hold on.

1396
01:59:59,492 --> 02:00:03,729
Who in the fuck do you think you are?
Where the fuck do you think you are?

1397
02:00:03,829 --> 02:00:07,947
Why the fuck shouldn't I just
put your ass in a Dumpster?

1398
02:00:08,047 --> 02:00:08,901
I got money.

1399
02:00:09,001 --> 02:00:11,571
I got money.
- I got $1,000 in my wallet.

1400
02:00:11,671 --> 02:00:15,156
It's for you.
- If I want your money, man.

1401
02:00:15,246 --> 02:00:17,246
I will take your money.

1402
02:00:18,010 --> 02:00:20,580
Just tell me where my daughter is.

1403
02:00:20,680 --> 02:00:23,099
Please? Please?

1404
02:00:28,688 --> 02:00:30,856
Don't do that shit again.

1405
02:00:37,363 --> 02:00:42,101
Look, Jesus, man, I'm telling you,
don't do this vigilante thing.

1406
02:00:42,201 --> 02:00:45,271
Either the cops are gonna find her,
or she's gonna call you.

1407
02:00:45,371 --> 02:00:47,371
Okay?

1408
02:00:47,449 --> 02:00:49,449
I promise.

1409
02:01:17,695 --> 02:01:19,695
Ana.

1410
02:01:21,157 --> 02:01:24,217
If Manolo hadn't done what he did...

1411
02:01:24,910 --> 02:01:29,670
they wouldn't have been able
to get Salazar and Madrigal.

1412
02:01:33,878 --> 02:01:36,464
He did something really good.

1413
02:01:39,508 --> 02:01:43,843
What's more, he did
something important for Tijuana.

1414
02:01:44,930 --> 02:01:47,350
I would like to believe you.

1415
02:01:54,982 --> 02:01:58,444
You don't have to believe me...

1416
02:02:00,571 --> 02:02:02,698
because it's the truth.

1417
02:02:03,949 --> 02:02:06,369
The simple truth.

1418
02:02:22,635 --> 02:02:25,950
Tomorrow I'm going to burn his clothes.

1419
02:03:13,227 --> 02:03:16,347
I know she's in there.
Just let me talk to her.

1420
02:03:16,447 --> 02:03:19,267
Look, I know she's in there, man.

1421
02:03:19,367 --> 02:03:22,257
No, I fucking know she's in there.

1422
02:03:25,698 --> 02:03:27,900
Jesus Christ.

1423
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,661
I-I haven't touched her.

1424
02:03:36,584 --> 02:03:39,899
You get the fuck out of here right now.

1425
02:03:52,725 --> 02:03:54,725
Hi.

1426
02:04:01,275 --> 02:04:03,444
Hi, Daddy.

1427
02:04:06,614 --> 02:04:08,783
Hi, sweetheart.

1428
02:04:42,316 --> 02:04:45,486
Hey, good morning, Eddie.

1429
02:04:45,611 --> 02:04:47,655
Good morning.
- Big day.

1430
02:04:49,156 --> 02:04:53,661
You're a star.

1431
02:04:53,828 --> 02:04:57,738
Why don't you go take a shower, man?
You smell.

1432
02:04:58,290 --> 02:05:01,995
Who is it?
- It's the Mafia.

1433
02:05:02,095 --> 02:05:05,381
I've got his breakfast.
- Coming.

1434
02:05:09,135 --> 02:05:12,110
So who's this going to?
- Over here.

1435
02:05:18,811 --> 02:05:21,772
Ooh.
- Fuck off.

1436
02:05:21,897 --> 02:05:25,602
Relax, Eddie.
- Yeah, where has the love gone?

1437
02:05:25,702 --> 02:05:27,702
Good-bye.

1438
02:05:28,029 --> 02:05:30,097
You know, you're gonna be testifying
for about ten days.

1439
02:05:30,197 --> 02:05:32,400
We could just decide
to stop feeding your ass.

1440
02:05:32,500 --> 02:05:35,136
You expect me to be grateful
for spending the rest of my life...

1441
02:05:35,236 --> 02:05:36,395
looking over my shoulder?

1442
02:05:36,495 --> 02:05:40,249
Wow, that's-- that's heavy, Eddie.

1443
02:05:43,044 --> 02:05:45,457
Can't you for one second imagine
that none of this had happened.

1444
02:05:45,557 --> 02:05:46,781
that my drugs had gone through?

1445
02:05:46,881 --> 02:05:48,881
What would be the harm?

1446
02:05:48,959 --> 02:05:51,118
Huh? What would be the harm?

1447
02:05:51,218 --> 02:05:53,921
A few people get high
who are getting high anyway.

1448
02:05:54,021 --> 02:05:57,058
Your partner's still alive.

1449
02:05:57,224 --> 02:06:00,709
We don't have to have breakfast together.

1450
02:06:00,791 --> 02:06:02,764
Don't you see this means nothing?

1451
02:06:02,864 --> 02:06:05,329
Your whole life is pointless.

1452
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:09,120
You're really breaking my heart.

1453
02:06:10,696 --> 02:06:16,285
The worst part about you, Monty--
- 'Monty'?

1454
02:06:16,410 --> 02:06:18,321
The worst part about you, Monty,

1455
02:06:18,421 --> 02:06:21,741
is you realize the futility of what
you're doing, and you do it anyway.

1456
02:06:21,841 --> 02:06:24,652
Wish you could see
how transparent you are.

1457
02:06:24,752 --> 02:06:26,904
This food tastes like shit.

1458
02:06:27,004 --> 02:06:31,339
So, take your stank ass
and go get a shower already.

1459
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:34,671
Let me tell you something.

1460
02:06:34,771 --> 02:06:37,674
You only got to me because you
were tipped off by the Juarez cartel...

1461
02:06:37,774 --> 02:06:39,676
who's trying to break into Tijuana.

1462
02:06:39,776 --> 02:06:43,179
You are helping them. Uh-huh.
- Mmm.

1463
02:06:43,279 --> 02:06:47,614
So, remember, you work
for a drug dealer too, Monty.

1464
02:06:47,709 --> 02:06:49,709
Fuck me.

1465
02:06:49,796 --> 02:06:52,697
Who is it?
- Breakfast.

1466
02:06:55,282 --> 02:06:57,577
Hurry up.
It's getting cold.

1467
02:07:01,914 --> 02:07:03,914
Okay. One second.

1468
02:07:05,084 --> 02:07:07,662
Get the fuck down.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1469
02:07:07,762 --> 02:07:11,311
Get down. Get the fuck down.
- Hey, hey, I'm on your side.

1470
02:07:11,411 --> 02:07:14,619
What the fuck?
- Oh, shit. Call an ambulance.

1471
02:07:14,719 --> 02:07:16,311
Call an ambulance. Fuck.
- Palms up.

1472
02:07:16,411 --> 02:07:17,705
Spread your damn hands out.

1473
02:07:17,805 --> 02:07:20,850
Shit. Eddie.

1474
02:07:23,394 --> 02:07:25,471
Hold on.

1475
02:07:25,571 --> 02:07:28,801
Oh, shit.
Hurry up with that ambulance.

1476
02:07:28,901 --> 02:07:31,527
Shit. Hold on. Hold on.

1477
02:07:34,321 --> 02:07:38,061
Your Honor, ladies
and gentlemen of the jury,

1478
02:07:38,161 --> 02:07:42,071
because of the sudden death
of Eduardo Ruiz,

1479
02:07:42,171 --> 02:07:47,135
the people have determined
that we cannot continue our case...

1480
02:07:47,235 --> 02:07:48,819
against Carl Ayala.

1481
02:07:48,919 --> 02:07:51,922
Oh. Oh.

1482
02:07:54,425 --> 02:07:57,740
Thank you so much.
Thank you, thank you.

1483
02:09:42,158 --> 02:09:44,610
Yeah?

1484
02:09:44,710 --> 02:09:46,710
Hi.

1485
02:09:47,830 --> 02:09:51,200
I got a copy of your speech.

1486
02:09:51,300 --> 02:09:54,003
It's fantastic.

1487
02:09:54,128 --> 02:09:56,714
So, Robert, my genuine thanks.

1488
02:09:56,839 --> 02:09:58,950
You're my choice.
You're gonna be great.

1489
02:09:59,050 --> 02:10:01,869
The president's sorry he hasn't been
able to spend more time with you.

1490
02:10:01,969 --> 02:10:05,548
After the press conference,
he wants to really sit down.

1491
02:10:05,648 --> 02:10:09,852
Oh, and I got to the Post too.

1492
02:10:09,977 --> 02:10:12,713
Don't worry about that thing
with your daughter. It's not news.

1493
02:10:12,813 --> 02:10:17,093
They're willing to treat it
as a family matter, personal matter.

1494
02:10:17,193 --> 02:10:21,105
Anyway, if it came out,
we could turn it into a qualification.

1495
02:10:21,205 --> 02:10:23,232
'I've been in the trenches of the drug war.

1496
02:10:23,332 --> 02:10:26,235
I've seen the face of the enemy.
Etcetera, etcetera.'

1497
02:10:26,335 --> 02:10:31,157
A sterling reputation
and close friend of the president,

1498
02:10:31,257 --> 02:10:34,944
recently confirmed into the Office
of National Drug Control Policy,

1499
02:10:35,044 --> 02:10:39,757
our new drug czar,
Robert Hudson Wakefield.

1500
02:10:50,226 --> 02:10:53,754
The war on drugs is a war
that we have to win,

1501
02:10:53,854 --> 02:10:56,891
and a war that we can win.

1502
02:10:56,991 --> 02:11:02,763
We have to win this war to save
our country's most precious resource--...

1503
02:11:02,863 --> 02:11:05,566
our children.

1504
02:11:05,666 --> 02:11:10,154
Sixty-eight million children
have been targeted...

1505
02:11:10,254 --> 02:11:13,249
by those who perpetrate this war...

1506
02:11:14,750 --> 02:11:19,714
and protecting these children
must be priority number one.

1507
02:11:23,426 --> 02:11:28,931
There has been progress,
and there has been failure.

1508
02:11:29,056 --> 02:11:32,427
But where we have fallen short.

1509
02:11:32,527 --> 02:11:35,938
I see not a problem.

1510
02:11:36,063 --> 02:11:39,817
I see an opportunity.

1511
02:11:43,279 --> 02:11:46,324
An opportunity...

1512
02:11:46,449 --> 02:11:52,113
to correct the mistakes...
ofthe past...

1513
02:11:52,213 --> 02:11:56,625
while laying a foundation for the future.

1514
02:12:02,256 --> 02:12:04,709
This takes...

1515
02:12:04,809 --> 02:12:08,512
not only new ideas...

1516
02:12:08,637 --> 02:12:11,549
but perseverance.

1517
02:12:11,649 --> 02:12:17,438
This takes not only...
resources, but courage.

1518
02:12:17,563 --> 02:12:19,563
This takes...

1519
02:12:19,660 --> 02:12:22,818
not only... government,

1520
02:12:22,943 --> 02:12:25,529
but families.

1521
02:12:27,490 --> 02:12:29,533
I've laid out a--

1522
02:12:32,953 --> 02:12:36,916
I've laid out a ten-point plan that--

1523
02:12:52,014 --> 02:12:54,014
I can't do this.

1524
02:12:57,353 --> 02:13:01,399
If there is a war on drugs,

1525
02:13:01,524 --> 02:13:05,569
then many of our family members
are the enemy.

1526
02:13:09,031 --> 02:13:14,245
And I don't know how you wage war
on your own family.

1527
02:13:57,413 --> 02:14:00,124
National Airport, please.

1528
02:14:45,378 --> 02:14:49,540
Hey, Arnie, it's Saturday.
You're working too hard, my friend.

1529
02:14:49,640 --> 02:14:52,835
Carl, I'm running late.
I'm coming right over.

1530
02:14:52,935 --> 02:14:57,882
No, no, no, don't bother, Arnie.
Let me ask you something.

1531
02:14:57,982 --> 02:15:00,885
When were you gonna tell me
about the $3 million...

1532
02:15:00,985 --> 02:15:05,464
we got in from San Francisco
two days after I was arrested?

1533
02:15:05,564 --> 02:15:09,485
Um... I was waiting for the right time.

1534
02:15:09,610 --> 02:15:12,930
Oh. You didn't think you could trust
my wife with that information?

1535
02:15:13,030 --> 02:15:15,155
I didn't want to risk it.

1536
02:15:15,233 --> 02:15:17,694
That could have been frozen
along with everything else.

1537
02:15:17,794 --> 02:15:20,062
You had it all figured out,
didn'tyou?

1538
02:15:20,162 --> 02:15:22,073
You were gonna move into my house,

1539
02:15:22,173 --> 02:15:25,751
raise my kids, sleep in my bed...

1540
02:15:25,876 --> 02:15:28,045
with my wife.

1541
02:15:28,170 --> 02:15:30,423
Sounds like a nice plan.

1542
02:15:30,589 --> 02:15:32,589
Oh, is it insane?

1543
02:15:32,675 --> 02:15:35,286
Just think about it, okay?
If I was gonna rip you off,

1544
02:15:35,386 --> 02:15:37,588
why wouldn't I just leave town
after Ruiz was killed?

1545
02:15:37,688 --> 02:15:40,842
Why would I sit next to you
in court and listen to a dismissal?

1546
02:15:40,942 --> 02:15:43,602
Let me ask you something.
You think there's a difference...

1547
02:15:43,702 --> 02:15:45,296
between a reason and an excuse?

1548
02:15:45,396 --> 02:15:47,898
'Cause I don't.

1549
02:15:48,024 --> 02:15:51,318
Good-bye, Arnie.
- Carl--

1550
02:15:51,444 --> 02:15:53,444
Carl?

1551
02:16:01,203 --> 02:16:03,414
Come on, sweetheart.

1552
02:16:03,539 --> 02:16:06,651
Come outside.
Everyone's waiting for you.

1553
02:16:06,751 --> 02:16:09,120
Who was that?
- Arnie. He's, uh--...

1554
02:16:09,220 --> 02:16:11,456
He can't make it to the barbecue.
- Oh.

1555
02:16:11,556 --> 02:16:14,091
Come on.
- Hi, Helena.

1556
02:16:15,801 --> 02:16:17,712
Hello.
- It's a great party.

1557
02:16:17,812 --> 02:16:20,164
Who is he, a friend of yours?
- Oh, I'm a nobody.

1558
02:16:20,264 --> 02:16:22,792
I'm the nobody who arrested you.

1559
02:16:22,892 --> 02:16:25,345
You're--
- How you doing?

1560
02:16:25,445 --> 02:16:27,805
What are you doing in my house?
- Oh, just looking around.

1561
02:16:27,905 --> 02:16:31,351
You got nice shit. Drug money
buys a lot of nice shit, Carl.

1562
02:16:31,451 --> 02:16:33,761
Listen, you don't want to talk
that way in my house.

1563
02:16:33,861 --> 02:16:36,013
You're fucking a murderer, Carl.

1564
02:16:36,113 --> 02:16:38,483
Fuck you and fuck your wife.
- Hey, you can't be in here.

1565
02:16:38,583 --> 02:16:42,028
Get him out.
- You put me out, Carl.

1566
02:16:42,128 --> 02:16:44,113
I'm a cop.
- I don't care.

1567
02:16:44,213 --> 02:16:47,458
Get out.
- Hey. Hey, hey.

1568
02:16:54,215 --> 02:16:58,160
Is that what you wanted?
- A nice little bedtime story, Helena.

1569
02:16:58,260 --> 02:17:00,371
Tell him how you murdered my partner.

1570
02:17:00,471 --> 02:17:02,999
You got the wrong--
- His name was Ray Castro, Helena.

1571
02:17:03,099 --> 02:17:06,344
Ray Castro.
You remember that.

1572
02:17:06,444 --> 02:17:08,680
What's his problem?
- The carpet, sweetheart.

1573
02:17:08,780 --> 02:17:11,500
No, no, no, I got it.
- I got it.

1574
02:17:13,776 --> 02:17:17,176
Where did he come from?
- Outside, honey.

1575
02:17:22,660 --> 02:17:25,040
What do you want to do, man?

1576
02:17:54,191 --> 02:17:58,104
On the good days, I feel like I get it.

1577
02:17:58,204 --> 02:18:02,108
Like it all makes sense.

1578
02:18:02,208 --> 02:18:04,485
I can stay in the moment.

1579
02:18:04,585 --> 02:18:09,373
I don't have to control
everything in the future...

1580
02:18:09,498 --> 02:18:15,254
and I believe everything
is gonna work out fine.

1581
02:18:18,507 --> 02:18:20,507
O-On the bad days.

1582
02:18:22,178 --> 02:18:26,457
I just want to grab the phone
and start dialing numbers.

1583
02:18:26,557 --> 02:18:30,261
I want to pull my hair...

1584
02:18:30,361 --> 02:18:34,607
and run through the streets screaming.

1585
02:18:39,028 --> 02:18:44,116
But thanks to the people
I've met in these rooms,

1586
02:18:44,241 --> 02:18:48,454
like Margaret and Jim...

1587
02:18:48,579 --> 02:18:51,470
and Sarah,

1588
02:18:51,570 --> 02:18:54,126
um...

1589
02:18:54,251 --> 02:18:56,663
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna make it...

1590
02:18:56,763 --> 02:18:58,798
through today.

1591
02:19:10,267 --> 02:19:12,812
Would you like to share?

1592
02:19:14,105 --> 02:19:17,650
Uh... my name is Robert.

1593
02:19:17,775 --> 02:19:20,687
My wife Barbara and I...

1594
02:19:20,787 --> 02:19:24,657
are here to support our daughter, Caroline,

1595
02:19:24,782 --> 02:19:27,702
and we're hear to listen.
