1
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:25,292
<i>She was Lo. Plain Lo in the morning.</i>

2
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,417
<i>Standing four feet ten in one sock.</i>

3
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,583
<i>She was Lola in slacks.</i>

4
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:33,792
<i>She was Dolly at school.</i>

5
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,750
<i>She was Dolores on the dotted line.</i>

6
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,417
<i>In my arms, she was always...</i>

7
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,583
<i>..Lolita.</i>

8
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:46,292
<i>Light of my life.</i>

9
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,458
<i>Fire of my loins.</i>

10
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,208
<i>My sin.</i>

11
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,958
<i>My soul.</i>

12
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,125
<i>Lolita.</i>

13
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:01,208
<i>But there might have been
no Lolita at all...</i>

14
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,375
<i>..had I not first met Annabel.</i>

15
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:13,167
<i>We were both 14.</i>

16
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:17,625
<i>Whatever happens to a boy
during the summer he's 14...</i>

17
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:19,917
<i>..can mark him for life.</i>

18
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,375
<i>That hotel you see, the Mirana,...</i>

19
00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:35,125
<i>..that belonged to us.</i>

20
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,208
<i>She wanted to be a nurse.</i>

21
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,750
<i>I wanted to be a spy.</i>

22
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,500
<i>All at once we were madly,
hopelessly in love.</i>

23
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,792
<i>Four months later, she died of typhus.</i>

24
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:11,583
<i>The shock of her death
froze something in me.</i>

25
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,750
<i>The child I loved was gone.</i>

26
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,958
<i>But I kept looking for her...</i>

27
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,917
<i>..long after I'd left
my own childhood behind.</i>

28
00:05:28,042 --> 00:05:30,292
<i>The poison was in the wound, you see.</i>

29
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,458
<i>And the wound wouldn't heal.</i>

30
00:05:43,417 --> 00:05:46,375
<i>I probably should have
joined the priesthood.</i>

31
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:50,958
<i>Instead, I accepted a teaching post
at Beardsley College in America.</i>

32
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:55,208
<i>I had a summer free
before the Fall semester.</i>

33
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:58,250
<i>I thought I'd finish
a textbook I was working on.</i>

34
00:05:58,417 --> 00:06:01,625
<i>A survey of French literature
for American students.</i>

35
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:09,917
<i>I took my advance...</i>

36
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:15,000
<i>..and went to live at the house of friends
of my late uncle's, the McCoos,...</i>

37
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,583
<i>..in the New England town of Ramsdale.</i>

38
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:23,458
<i>But on arriving, I found
that it was no longer there.</i>

39
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:29,958
<i>However, a friend of Mrs McCoo,...</i>

40
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,208
<i>..a widow, Mrs Charlotte Haze,...</i>

41
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,167
<i>..agreed to accommodate me.</i>

42
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:46,375
- Goddamn dog!

43
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,292
One minute. Something's burnin'.

44
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,917
Lord have mercy!

45
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,083
Mrs Haze'll be down in one.

46
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:24,667
Is that Professor Humbert,
Louise? Tell him I'll be down in one.

47
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,667
She'll be down in one!

48
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,333
Monsieur Humbert.

49
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,417
Uh, yes.

50
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,583
Mrs Haze, is it?

51
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,750
Charlotte.

52
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:47,500
I am so pleased
to make your acquaintance.

53
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:51,083
Frank McCoo told me all about
your scholarly pursuits.

54
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,292
I myself just cherish the French tongue.

55
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,625
Um... I wonder, could I...

56
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:01,625
Mm. Come in.

57
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,792
Harold and I, the late Mr Haze,...

58
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,917
..we simply adored Mexico.

59
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:11,333
The whole idea
of a culture that sophisticated.

60
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,750
And we think of them as primitive.

61
00:08:13,917 --> 00:08:15,917
I mean, look at us!

62
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:18,458
Indeed, yes.

63
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,125
Upstairs.

64
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,375
I and Lo have our rooms just there.

65
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:26,792
And this is your room.

66
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,208
Space for a desk, anything you want.

67
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,875
And at $20 a month,
you can't beat the price.

68
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,125
And here's the bathroom.
It's a bit of a mess.

69
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,875
And this is the kitchen.

70
00:08:50,042 --> 00:08:54,000
Now, if you have any special
food needs, you just say.

71
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:58,750
I don't know if Ramsdale can provide you
with foie grass, like you're used to.

72
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:00,417
What's that?

73
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:04,000
Uh... timetable. For when I um...

74
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:08,625
I was hoping I wouldn't have to,
but I think I've got to go back to New York.

75
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:13,792
- Oh, you're not too favourably impressed.
- No... There's a Baudelaire conference...

76
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:18,292
This is not a neat household,
but you would be very comfortable here.

77
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,292
Very comfortable indeed.

78
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:23,500
Don't say no until you've seen the piazza.

79
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:25,667
Come.

80
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:29,042
Well, I call it the piazza.

81
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,458
It's so much work
to keep it healthy and green.

82
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:37,667
It's a life's work.

83
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:41,292
That's my Lo.

84
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,833
And these are my lilies.

85
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
I love lilies.

86
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:58,458
- Lily's a nice name, don't you think?
- Beautiful.

87
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,958
Beautiful!

88
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:49,583
How much did you say the room was?

89
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
<i>A normal man,...</i>

90
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:51,125
<i>..given a group photograph
of schoolgirls...</i>

91
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:55,083
<i>..and asked to point out
the loveliest one,...</i>

92
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,833
<i>..will not necessarily choose
the nymphet among them.</i>

93
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,625
<i>You have to be an artist,...</i>

94
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:10,167
<i>..a madman, full of shame
and melancholy and despair,...</i>

95
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:14,542
<i>..in order to recognise the little
deadly demon among the others.</i>

96
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
<i>She stands...</i>

97
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,542
<i>..unrecognised by them,...</i>

98
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:27,375
<i>..unconscious herself
of her fantastic power.</i>

99
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:34,958
- See you later, alligator.
- After a while, crocodile!

100
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,375
- Real soon, Daniel Boone.
- Get fucked, Daffy Duck.

101
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:06,917
<i># Don't know why...
there's no sun up in the sky</i>

102
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,167
<i># Stormy weather</i>

103
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:15,000
<i># Since my man and I ain't together...</i>

104
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:17,167
You woke me up.

105
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:20,750
- Sorry.

106
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:26,208
I'll stop.

107
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:10,042
Dolores!
Have you made your bed?

108
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:12,833
No, I have not made my bed.

109
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,792
I asked you to make your bed, didn't I?

110
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,667
No. You asked me if I'd made my bed.

111
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:21,542
Make your bed.

112
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:24,708
- Now!

113
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,958
<i>I long for some terrific disaster.</i>

114
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,083
<i>Earthquake.</i>

115
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,250
<i>Spectacular explosion.</i>

116
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:33,208
Make your bed!

117
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,333
<i>Her mother instantly eliminated.</i>

118
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,667
<i>Along with everybody else
for miles around.</i>

119
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:45,792
<i>Lolita...</i>

120
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,958
<i>..in my arms.</i>

121
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:23,542
I'm sleepy today.

122
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,583
Me too.

123
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,583
Have you been having trouble sleeping?

124
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:34,417
You can't imagine.

125
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,042
Am I getting a zit?

126
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,625
What?

127
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:16,792
Do you see a pimple on my chin?

128
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,792
You look absolutely perfect to me.

129
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,417
Wanna see my chin wobble?

130
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,375
OK.

131
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,458
Humbert!

132
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:55,083
Humbert...

133
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:59,000
Is she keeping you up?

134
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,750
I beg your pardon?

135
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,667
No!

136
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,167
No. No, I'm...

137
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:09,417
No.

138
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,708
Well, it's probably just a 24-hour bug.

139
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,292
He was looking forward to meeting you.

140
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,708
Has anybody seen my other sneaker?!

141
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,958
Your breakfast, Professor Humbert.

142
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,625
Don't tell Mother, but I ate all your bacon.

143
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:57,208
- Dolores, that was Mrs Farlow.
- So?

144
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:00,583
Rose has a temperature
and can't go to Hourglass Lake.

145
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,042
- Oh, yeah?
- Do not use that tone with me!

146
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,083
Are you ready for church?

147
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,833
I'm not going to that disgusting church.

148
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,042
- Young lady...
- No picnic, no church.

149
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:14,042
That is fine with me.
It is your conscience.

150
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:17,208
I want your room spick-and-span
when I get home.

151
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,333
- And wash your hair, young lady.
- I did wash it!

152
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
- When?
- A couple of months ago.

153
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,333
I could be a dancer.

154
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,625
That's a major option.

155
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,333
Cos I do have a natural grace.

156
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,833
- You know. A kind of sad beauty.
- Sort of sad is right.

157
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,875
I'd like to see you dance sometime.

158
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:11,542
Little girls always want to be
ballerinas, don't they?

159
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,708
I know I did.

160
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:17,083
But I was - how should I put it? -
a tad too... plump?

161
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,333
- Is that the right word?
- Yes.

162
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:24,667
I'll get more Vouvray.

163
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:33,292
Make her take us
to Hourglass Lake tomorrow.

164
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,750
- Me?
- Mm-hm.

165
00:20:35,917 --> 00:20:37,917
She'll do anything you say.

166
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,250
She's getting a thing about you.

167
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,792
Whisper, whisper.

168
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,333
What are you two so cosy about?

169
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,167
Um... Did I ever tell you both that...

170
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:01,375
..I was once a...

171
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:03,542
..that I was once a... um...

172
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:09,167
Uh... that I...
I was once a cook in the North Pole?

173
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:12,000
- A cook?
- Well, not exactly a cook.

174
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,125
I opened a few cans.

175
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:19,458
It was a weather expedition.
And I shot a polar bear.

176
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,625
- No!
- Well, I didn't hit it.

177
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,875
Why shoot a polar bear?
That's a lousy thing to do.

178
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:27,625
Because I found it...

179
00:21:27,792 --> 00:21:31,333
..with its face - listen to this -
in the ice-cream mixer.

180
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,542
I couldn't let that pass
because we lived off ice cream.

181
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,208
You're out of your gourd, Humpy.

182
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,250
Will you stop fidgeting with the doll?

183
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,583
And now we all think
that Lo should go to bed.

184
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,750
Lo?

185
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:54,917
What do you mean "we", paleface?

186
00:21:56,208 --> 00:22:00,375
So, as I was saying, there I was
with my white polar-bear gun...

187
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:05,083
- ..to blend in.

188
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,250
It's for me!

189
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:10,542
Hello?

190
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:16,375
- No, I'm sorry. She's busy.
- I hope you will forgive her bad manners.

191
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:18,500
- Now what?!

192
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:21,208
Look! It's my modern dance creation!

193
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:29,042
Dolores Haze, turn that music down!

194
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:36,042
She is a pest. Just slap her hard
if she interferes with your meditations.

195
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:40,583
Psst!

196
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,000
Hum...

197
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:59,583
Hum, do you know that I have
one most ambitious dream?

198
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,083
To get a hold of a real trained maid...

199
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,583
..like that German girl
that the Talbots spoke of...

200
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,750
..and have her live in the house.

201
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:09,917
- No room.
- Oh, chéri, chéri.

202
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:14,125
You underestimate the possibilities
of our humble household.

203
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,375
We'd put her in Lo's room.

204
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:20,083
I intended to turn that hole
into a guest room anyway.

205
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,250
But where would Lo sleep?

206
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:25,708
Little Lo does not enter the picture at all.

207
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:29,833
Little Lo goes straight from camp
to a good boarding school...

208
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,958
..with strict discipline
and some sound religious training.

209
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,042
I won't go!

210
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:43,500
I want all of these name tags
sewn on your clothes by tomorrow.

211
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:47,042
I don't want to go.

212
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:48,833
I didn't ask your opinion!

213
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,417
I don't want to go and you can't make me.

214
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:54,750
Look, we all think it's a good idea.

215
00:23:54,917 --> 00:23:59,708
Professor Humbert thinks it's a good idea,
I think it's a good idea, and you are going!

216
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:04,750
Double-crosser!

217
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:07,125
Ow!

218
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:12,167
I asked you to put that suitcase
in the car an hour ago!

219
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:15,708
Louise, thank you so much
for helping the poor child.

220
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:23,042
Goddamn it! Dolores, I told you
to put this lunch basket in the back seat!

221
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:25,417
Why always tell me to do everything?

222
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:27,792
I'm the one that won't be eating it.

223
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:31,208
Louise! Brussels sprouts
and meat loaf for dinner.

224
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:34,458
- All right. Drive careful.
- Thank you. Let's go!

225
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,625
- Bye, my baby.
- Bye, Louise.

226
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:39,292
- You be good. I'm gonna miss you.
- Agh!

227
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,750
Dolores!

228
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:45,042
Let's go!

229
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:47,000
Speed it up!

230
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:48,917
Get in the car!

231
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:56,625
Now what?! That child!

232
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,417
- Louise, maybe tenderloin.
- That'd be good.

233
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:54,458
I'm waiting!

234
00:25:55,292 --> 00:25:58,667
If I've told you once,
I've told you a thousand times...

235
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:01,250
..not to make me wait in the car.

236
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:05,708
If you weren't going to camp,
I would ground you.

237
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,750
Mr Humble!

238
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:34,792
These damn stairs
are gonna be the death of me.

239
00:26:34,958 --> 00:26:36,708
Mr Humble!

240
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,583
Mr Humble!

241
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,750
Mr Humble?

242
00:26:45,792 --> 00:26:47,792
I have something for you.

243
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:50,125
Oh, yes.

244
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:53,625
I'm leaving, but I'll be back later.

245
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:59,500
What the hell he doin' in there?

246
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:05,417
"This is a confession.

247
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,583
I love you.

248
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,083
I'm a passionate and lonely woman...

249
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,250
..and you are the love of my life.

250
00:27:12,417 --> 00:27:14,417
Now you know.

251
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:17,000
So please, destroy this letter and go.

252
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:21,500
I shall return by dinner time
and you must be gone by then.

253
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,750
You see, chéri, if I found you at home,...

254
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:29,417
..the fact of your remaining
would mean only one thing.

255
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:33,750
That you want me as much as I do you,
as a lifelong mate,...

256
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:38,833
..and that you are ready to link up
your life with mine for ever and ever...

257
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,833
..and be a father to my little girl."

258
00:27:44,042 --> 00:27:48,708
<i>Two weeks later,
we were married in a simple ceremony.</i>

259
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:53,042
<i>Big Haze made sure little Haze
was not in attendance.</i>

260
00:27:58,583 --> 00:28:00,583
Mm. This is bliss.

261
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,167
This is heaven on earth.
Isn't it, Hump?

262
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:05,333
Mm.

263
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:11,125
Are you working on your book?

264
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:13,292
Yes.

265
00:28:21,292 --> 00:28:23,625
Oh, a secret drawer.
What's in there?

266
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:27,458
Locked-up love letters.

267
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:30,958
Where's the key?

268
00:28:31,917 --> 00:28:34,208
Hidden.

269
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:44,083
<i>During the six weeks
we'd been married,...</i>

270
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:47,750
<i>..I successfully avoided
most of my husbandly duties.</i>

271
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:55,833
<i>Throughout July, I'd been offering
Charlotte various sleeping tablets,...</i>

272
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,167
<i>..which she gobbled down happily.</i>

273
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:00,333
<i>She was a great taker of pills.</i>

274
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:06,708
<i># I'm in the mood for love</i>

275
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:11,250
<i># Simply because you're near me</i>

276
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:15,667
<i># Funny, but when you're near me</i>

277
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:19,958
<i># I'm in the mood for love</i>

278
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:24,708
<i># Heaven is in your eyes</i>

279
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:28,458
<i># Bright as the stars we're under</i>

280
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:33,083
<i># Oh, is it any wonder...</i>

281
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,958
<i>The last dose I had tried
had knocked her out for four hours.</i>

282
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:41,167
<i>But that was not enough
to guarantee me an undisturbed night.</i>

283
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:46,125
Hum...

284
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:48,958
At last!

285
00:29:51,042 --> 00:29:52,417
Mm.

286
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,542
I think I must be immune.

287
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:02,750
Wh... What would you give me
if you wanted to uh...

288
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:04,667
..to knock out...

289
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:06,542
..say, a cow?

290
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:11,292
J-Just for... seven or eight hours.

291
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:13,042
So that...

292
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:18,208
..you know, the cow... would stay asleep?

293
00:30:20,708 --> 00:30:24,208
Even if you were
tossing and turning next to it.

294
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,875
Well...

295
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:28,417
Why don't you...

296
00:30:28,583 --> 00:30:30,167
..try these?

297
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:31,917
They're new.

298
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,917
My wife takes them and...

299
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:39,583
..I don't hear a peep out of her
all night long.

300
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:42,917
Sounds like just the thing.

301
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I'm home!

302
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:01,292
Hello?

303
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,083
Hello?

304
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:11,000
Hello?

305
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:23,208
"The Haze woman."

306
00:31:24,792 --> 00:31:26,792
"The fat cow"?

307
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:31,208
"The obnoxious mamma"?

308
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:39,500
Well, the "old stupid Haze woman"
is no longer your dupe.

309
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:42,042
Charlotte!

310
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,708
You're a monster.

311
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:50,333
- You're a despicable, criminal monster.

312
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,167
- Now...
- If you come near me I'll scream!

313
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:55,417
- Let me just...
- Get away from me!

314
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:57,708
I'm leaving tonight.

315
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:00,208
You can keep this house.
I don't care.

316
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:06,792
But you will never see
that miserable brat ever again.

317
00:32:09,542 --> 00:32:12,292
Now get out of my sight!

318
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:32,125
Charlotte, you mustn't...

319
00:32:32,292 --> 00:32:34,292
You mustn't ruin our lives.

320
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:38,708
That's...

321
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:43,292
That's just...
That's just a fragment of...

322
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:45,583
..a novel I'm writing.

323
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,833
I used your name on those...

324
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,250
..just for... convenience.

325
00:32:54,667 --> 00:32:56,667
I'll get us a drink.

326
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:16,083
A nice stiff drink
will clear both our heads.

327
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:24,000
Charlotte,
I made us a nice stiff drink!

328
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,250
Yes?

329
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,750
But that's ridiculous.

330
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:37,500
There's this man on the phone
saying you've been killed, Charlotte.

331
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:39,750
Charlotte?

332
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:23,042
I'm... I'm sorry.

333
00:34:28,417 --> 00:34:30,500
Stand back, please.

334
00:34:31,542 --> 00:34:33,667
Where's my wife?

335
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,917
- Are you Mr Humbert?
- I am.

336
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:41,958
She ran right in front of me.

337
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:44,292
I... I didn't even see her.

338
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,333
Sir?

339
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:56,708
I'm sorry, sir.

340
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:58,833
Is this Mrs Humbert?

341
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,792
Sir,...

342
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:06,000
..is this Mrs Humbert?

343
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:11,042
Oh, God...

344
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:15,500
Oh, God... Oh, God!

345
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:30,208
She was walking to the mailbox.

346
00:35:31,417 --> 00:35:33,667
She was going to mail these letters.

347
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:37,000
I'm sorry.

348
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:40,167
Thank you.

349
00:35:43,833 --> 00:35:46,250
I'll go and... lie down, officer.

350
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:49,542
- Will that be all right?
- You go right ahead, sir.

351
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:52,667
I'll just be across in the house if you...

352
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,833
Is that the Enchanted Hunters Hotel?

353
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Yes. This is Mr Humbert.

354
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:29,125
Tomorrow night.

355
00:37:29,292 --> 00:37:31,292
Just the one night, please.

356
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,167
Yes, a room with twin beds.

357
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:38,875
For two.
Well, one and a half people, really.

358
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:40,917
It's just for me and my...

359
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:44,833
..my short... my small daughter.

360
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,917
She should be here any minute.

361
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:28,167
I sent Charlie for her over at the barn.

362
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:32,667
- Who's Charlie?
- Come on, come on.

363
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:38,500
It's such a pleasure to watch
our young people make friends.

364
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:41,375
- So uh... who is this Charlie?
- Here she is.

365
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,833
Hi, Dad!

366
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,333
# Hum and Mum, Mum and Hum

367
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,500
# Hum and Mum, Mum and Hum

368
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:07,083
# Hum and Mum, Mum and Hum...

369
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:10,917
- How's Mum?
- Well... The doctors aren't quite sure.

370
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:13,333
It's something abdominal.

371
00:39:15,667 --> 00:39:17,167
Abominable?

372
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:19,333
Abdominal.

373
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:28,625
She's in a special hospital
over in Lepingville.

374
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:31,458
So... I thought we'd... we'd...

375
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:34,000
..go over to Briceland,...

376
00:39:34,167 --> 00:39:37,917
..spend the night there and...
visit the hospital tomorrow.

377
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:39,917
Or the next day.

378
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:47,333
So, did you have a good time at camp?

379
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,292
Mm-hm.

380
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:52,625
You know, I missed you.

381
00:39:52,792 --> 00:39:54,792
I missed you a lot.

382
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:57,542
Well, I didn't miss you.

383
00:39:57,708 --> 00:40:00,875
In fact, I've been
revoltingly unfaithful to you.

384
00:40:01,042 --> 00:40:04,542
But so what? Cos you don't care
about me any more anyway.

385
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:07,708
Why do you think I don't care about you?

386
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:10,917
Well, you haven't
kissed me yet, have you?

387
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,708
Oh!

388
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:45,458
- Uh, I'm sorry, officer.
- See a blue sedan, same make as yours?

389
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:50,583
- They might have passed you at the turn.
- Blue sedan? No, I don't think... agh!

390
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:54,583
- We didn't see a blue sedan.
- No, I don't think we did.

391
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:58,167
Are you sure it was blue?
I saw one that was more purple.

392
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:00,458
Or maybe it was more red.

393
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,708
All right, OK. Thank you.

394
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:06,333
- Thank you!

395
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,833
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

396
00:41:24,542 --> 00:41:26,542
Wow! Looks swank!

397
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:38,917
<i># No, I will never tell lies</i>

398
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:42,042
<i># But still I'm called Buttercup...</i>

399
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:46,083
Good evening. I have a reservation
in the name of Humbert.

400
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,250
Twin-bedded room.

401
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:51,083
I called last night.

402
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,917
- Two people.
- Oh!

403
00:41:54,042 --> 00:41:55,833
I'm sorry, Mr Humbug.

404
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,333
I held the room with the twin beds for you
till 6:30, but I didn't hear from you.

405
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:06,958
We hold till 6:30. And with the flower
show and Glory of Christ convention...

406
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:09,375
My name is not Humbug. It's Herbert.

407
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:11,458
Humbert.

408
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:17,083
Just put us in any room. Put a cot in
for my daughter. She's very tired.

409
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,917
Perhaps I could put you in room 342.
It has a double bed.

410
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:26,542
I expect we'll manage.
My wife may be turning up later.

411
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:32,417
Please sign here, mister.

412
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,917
It's a nice dog, huh?

413
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:43,083
I love dogs.

414
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:47,125
Well, that's my dog.

415
00:42:47,292 --> 00:42:49,000
He likes you.

416
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:51,708
Doesn't like everybody.

417
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:55,958
Who does he like?

418
00:42:57,125 --> 00:42:59,292
He can smell when people are sweet.

419
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:02,208
He likes sweet people.

420
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:04,875
Nice young people.

421
00:43:05,042 --> 00:43:07,042
Like you.

422
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:17,958
Here we are.

423
00:43:38,167 --> 00:43:40,167
Thanks very much.

424
00:43:42,417 --> 00:43:45,292
Wait a sec. You mean
we're sleeping in one room?

425
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:49,292
With one bed?

426
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:51,792
I've asked them to send up a cot,...

427
00:43:51,958 --> 00:43:53,958
..which I'll use, if you like.

428
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:00,000
You're crazy.

429
00:44:00,167 --> 00:44:02,708
Why, my darling?

430
00:44:02,875 --> 00:44:04,875
Because, my darling,...

431
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:09,583
..when my darling mother finds out,
she'll divorce you and strangle me.

432
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,250
Lo,...

433
00:44:11,417 --> 00:44:13,417
..listen to me a moment.

434
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:16,542
For all practical purposes,
I am your father,...

435
00:44:16,708 --> 00:44:19,125
..and I'm responsible for your welfare.

436
00:44:19,292 --> 00:44:21,833
Now, we're not rich.

437
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,625
So when we travel, we-we're sure to be...
I mean, we'll be thrown together.

438
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,250
Sometimes.

439
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:33,375
Two people sharing
the same hotel room...

440
00:44:33,542 --> 00:44:36,458
..are bound to... enter into a...

441
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:38,792
How can I put it? Into a kind of um...

442
00:44:39,042 --> 00:44:41,042
The word is "incest".

443
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:58,917
I feel like we're grown-ups.

444
00:44:59,042 --> 00:45:01,042
Me too.

445
00:45:01,208 --> 00:45:03,583
We get to do whatever we want, right?

446
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,708
Whatever we want.

447
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:07,458
Well, now.

448
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:09,417
Who had the pie?

449
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,458
Me.

450
00:45:16,292 --> 00:45:19,667
Whaddaya think? Are they me?

451
00:45:25,042 --> 00:45:27,042
- Don't look now.
- Why?

452
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:29,208
The guy over in the corner.

453
00:45:30,042 --> 00:45:32,458
Don't look! He was staring at us.

454
00:45:32,625 --> 00:45:36,000
Don't you think that guy
looks exactly like Quilty?

455
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:38,625
What, the dentist?

456
00:45:38,792 --> 00:45:41,375
Of course not. His brother.

457
00:45:41,542 --> 00:45:44,625
The writer Quilty.
You know, he writes the plays.

458
00:45:44,792 --> 00:45:48,042
The smoking guy.
He smokes the Dromes in the ad.

459
00:45:48,208 --> 00:45:50,375
We saw him in the lobby with his dog.

460
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:08,375
If I tell you how naughty I was at camp,...

461
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:12,167
..you promise you won't be mad?

462
00:46:13,167 --> 00:46:15,167
Tell me later.

463
00:46:18,958 --> 00:46:20,958
I want you to go to bed.

464
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:24,750
I'll go downstairs while you...

465
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,625
When I come up, I want you to be asleep.

466
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,000
All right?

467
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:44,792
I've been such a disgusting girl.

468
00:46:45,958 --> 00:46:47,958
Just let me tell you.

469
00:46:48,125 --> 00:46:50,125
Tell me tomorrow.

470
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:53,333
I'm going to go now. All right?

471
00:46:54,958 --> 00:46:56,958
Good night, Dad.

472
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:10,792
Night-night.

473
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:23,583
<i>Gentlewomen of the jury,...</i>

474
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:28,208
<i>..if my happiness could have talked,...</i>

475
00:47:28,375 --> 00:47:32,375
<i>..it would have filled that hotel
with a deafening roar.</i>

476
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,250
<i>My only regret...</i>

477
00:47:35,417 --> 00:47:39,667
<i>..is that I did not immediately deposit
key number 342 at the office...</i>

478
00:47:39,833 --> 00:47:44,458
<i>..and leave the town, the country,
the planet, that very night.</i>

479
00:47:44,625 --> 00:47:50,708
The Lord knows all,
the Lord sees all, the Lord forgives all.

480
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,917
Where the devil did you get her?

481
00:48:21,167 --> 00:48:24,833
- I beg your pardon?
- I said the weather's getting better.

482
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:33,083
It seems so.

483
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,250
Who's the lassie?

484
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,167
Um...

485
00:48:43,042 --> 00:48:45,042
It's my daughter.

486
00:48:45,208 --> 00:48:48,000
You lie. She's not.

487
00:48:49,417 --> 00:48:50,375
What?

488
00:48:51,792 --> 00:48:53,792
I said July was hot.

489
00:48:56,292 --> 00:48:58,792
Where's her mother?

490
00:48:59,917 --> 00:49:01,917
Dead.

491
00:49:02,083 --> 00:49:04,042
Oh. Sorry.

492
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:06,750
Why don't you two
lunch with me tomorrow?

493
00:49:06,917 --> 00:49:10,000
That clerical crowd will be gone soon.

494
00:49:10,667 --> 00:49:12,667
Um...

495
00:49:13,125 --> 00:49:15,125
We'll be gone too, thanks.

496
00:49:15,292 --> 00:49:16,792
Good night.

497
00:49:16,958 --> 00:49:20,000
Sorry. I'm very drunk. Good night.

498
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:27,000
That child of yours needs a lot of sleep.

499
00:49:27,167 --> 00:49:29,875
"Sleep is a rose" the Persians say.

500
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:34,375
Smoke?

501
00:49:34,542 --> 00:49:36,750
Not just now, thanks.

502
00:49:42,417 --> 00:49:44,875
Good night.

503
00:49:45,708 --> 00:49:47,708
Enjoy.

504
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:51,292
Get back in the boat with Charlie.
You don't have to do that.

505
00:51:54,417 --> 00:51:56,625
Back in the boat.

506
00:52:14,542 --> 00:52:16,542
I'm thirsty.

507
00:52:22,042 --> 00:52:24,042
I'll bring you something.

508
00:54:59,958 --> 00:55:03,167
You... You played that with Charlie?
At camp?

509
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:07,458
Don't tell me you never tried it
when you were a kid.

510
00:55:09,708 --> 00:55:11,917
Never.

511
00:55:14,208 --> 00:55:17,083
I guess I'm gonna have to
show you everything.

512
00:55:41,667 --> 00:55:43,667
<i>Gentlewomen of the jury,...</i>

513
00:55:43,833 --> 00:55:45,833
<i>..I was not even her first lover.</i>

514
00:55:59,125 --> 00:56:01,125
What are you reading?

515
00:56:01,292 --> 00:56:03,167
Nothing.

516
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,625
What's the matter?

517
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:11,333
Nothing.

518
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:15,333
Lo...

519
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:21,042
You know that friend of yours
- Charlie - at camp?

520
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:24,583
Was he the first one?

521
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:27,292
Can we please get off the subject?

522
00:56:35,833 --> 00:56:38,083
<i>I felt more and more uncomfortable.</i>

523
00:56:40,042 --> 00:56:43,000
<i>It was something quite special,
that feeling.</i>

524
00:56:43,375 --> 00:56:45,917
<i>An oppressive, hideous constraint,...</i>

525
00:56:46,083 --> 00:56:50,667
<i>..as if I were sitting with the small ghost
of somebody I had just killed.</i>

526
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,375
Jesus!

527
00:56:55,542 --> 00:56:57,042
What?

528
00:56:57,208 --> 00:56:59,458
Can we stop at a gas station?

529
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:02,042
We can go anywhere you like.

530
00:57:02,208 --> 00:57:04,208
Well, I need a gas station.

531
00:57:04,375 --> 00:57:06,167
I hurt inside.

532
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:11,333
Well, what do you expect?

533
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:15,125
I was a daisy-fresh girl,
and look what you've done to me.

534
00:57:15,292 --> 00:57:20,083
I should call the police and tell them
that you raped me, you dirty old man.

535
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:45,958
- Just wash the windscreen, would you?
- Yes, sir.

536
00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:21,292
Got some cookies.

537
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:26,542
I want to call Mother in hospital.
What's the number?

538
00:58:28,167 --> 00:58:30,375
Get in. You can't call the hospital.

539
00:58:30,542 --> 00:58:32,333
Why not?

540
00:58:33,542 --> 00:58:35,292
Just get in the car.

541
00:58:39,083 --> 00:58:40,583
Slam the door.

542
00:58:43,458 --> 00:58:46,167
Why can't I call my own mother
if I want to?

543
00:58:48,917 --> 00:58:50,917
Because your mother's dead.

544
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,667
Shh... Shh...

545
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:03,417
<i>We made up very gently that night.</i>

546
01:00:03,583 --> 01:00:06,625
<i>You see, she had nowhere else to go.</i>

547
01:00:13,667 --> 01:00:16,875
<i>It was then that we began
our extensive travels...</i>

548
01:00:17,042 --> 01:00:19,042
<i>..all over the United States.</i>

549
01:00:19,208 --> 01:00:23,708
<i># Now the native population
and civilisation is fine</i>

550
01:00:26,292 --> 01:00:30,792
<i># That civilisation
is the thing for me to see</i>

551
01:00:32,875 --> 01:00:35,708
<i># Whoa, bongo, bongo, bongo</i>

552
01:00:35,875 --> 01:00:38,875
<i># I don't wanna leave the Congo,
no, no, no, no, no, no</i>

553
01:00:41,667 --> 01:00:46,458
- When's the best time to buy a bird?
- I don't know. When's the best time?

554
01:00:46,625 --> 01:00:48,583
When it's going "cheep!"

555
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:51,000
Don't say I never gave you anything.

556
01:00:52,833 --> 01:00:54,708
Ow! Don't! I'm trying to drive!

557
01:00:58,417 --> 01:01:00,167
Don't do that! Oh, no!

558
01:01:01,833 --> 01:01:03,917
If it goes out the window, I won't stop.

559
01:01:04,083 --> 01:01:07,000
Don't! What are these? Hair grips?

560
01:01:17,208 --> 01:01:18,917
<i># Civilisation</i>

561
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:20,500

<i># I'll stay right here</i>

563
01:01:31,125 --> 01:01:33,125
Look! They have Magic Fingers.

564
01:01:34,542 --> 01:01:36,292
Good.

565
01:01:36,458 --> 01:01:38,458
I need to shower.

566
01:01:39,875 --> 01:01:41,875
Give me a quarter and a dime.

567
01:01:42,042 --> 01:01:43,542
What for?

568
01:01:43,708 --> 01:01:45,958
For the Magic Fingers.

569
01:01:47,042 --> 01:01:49,250
My magic fingers aren't enough?

570
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:23,292
# Amor-r-r, amor-r-r, amor-r-r-r-r

571
01:02:23,458 --> 01:02:28,458
# This w-word s-so s-sweet that I r-repeat

572
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:32,375
# Means I adore you-u-u-u-u

573

574
01:02:41,792 --> 01:02:43,792
Good shower for once, Lo!

575
01:02:43,958 --> 01:02:46,333
First-rate temperature control!

576
01:03:05,458 --> 01:03:07,000
Ow! Argh!

577
01:03:07,167 --> 01:03:10,292
- Agh! Lo!
- Hmm?

578
01:03:10,458 --> 01:03:13,667
My God, Lo!
Don't flush when I'm in here!

579
01:03:38,417 --> 01:03:40,417
What is that?

580
01:03:41,583 --> 01:03:43,583
What's what?

581
01:03:47,792 --> 01:03:50,208
That thing in your mouth.

582
01:03:50,375 --> 01:03:52,375
It's a jawbreaker.

583
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,958
It's supposed to break your jaw.
Want one?

584
01:03:57,125 --> 01:04:00,583
Just give it to me.
I've had it with that noise.

585
01:04:05,042 --> 01:04:08,458
- Come on, spit it out. I've got a headache.
- It's good!

586
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:12,208
Look, just give it to me, will you?
Spit it out.

587
01:04:43,042 --> 01:04:46,458
You look a hundred per cent better
when I can't see you.

588
01:04:46,625 --> 01:04:49,417
<i>We took a circuitous route -
to put it mildly.</i>

589
01:04:49,583 --> 01:04:52,875
<i>In the back of my mind
was our eventual destination.</i>

590
01:04:53,042 --> 01:04:58,583
<i>Beardsley College, where I would finally
take up my teaching position.</i>

591
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:03,708
<i>But in the front of my mind was
the need to keep going, keep driving.</i>

592
01:05:05,542 --> 01:05:09,000
Lo, that's the last time
I let you drive this car.

593
01:05:09,167 --> 01:05:10,417
Serve into this square.

594
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:13,750
<i>And, despite our tiffs,...</i>

595
01:05:15,125 --> 01:05:18,292
In the square, Lo.
Try and get it in the square.

596
01:05:18,458 --> 01:05:22,917
<i>..despite the fuss she made, and
the danger and hopelessness of it all,...</i>

597
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:24,542
Aim for my head.

598
01:05:24,708 --> 01:05:27,625
<i>..despite all that, I was in paradise.</i>

599
01:05:30,583 --> 01:05:34,583
<i>A paradise whose skies
were the colour of hell flames,...</i>

600
01:05:36,875 --> 01:05:38,875
<i>..but a paradise still.</i>

601
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:33,667
I know you have accepted a post
at Beardsley College,...

602
01:09:33,833 --> 01:09:38,333
..and I know that there,
academics are first, last and always.

603
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:41,917
Well, that's not us, Mr Himmler.

604
01:09:42,083 --> 01:09:44,833
Uh... Here at Beardsley Prep,...

605
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,083
..what we stress are the three Ds.

606
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:50,542
Dramatics, dancing and dating.

607
01:09:50,708 --> 01:09:55,583
Now, I know that the Reverend Rigger is
behind us on this. Aren't you, Reverend?

608
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:59,500
- All the way, Miss Pratt. Every inch.
- So you see, Mr Humper,...

609
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:04,750
..for the modern preadolescent, medieval
dates are less vital than weekend ones.

610
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:09,667
- What? Weekend what?
- Dates, Mr Humping.

611
01:10:09,833 --> 01:10:12,500
Uh... boys.

612

<i>On the one hand,

Humbert the happy housewife.</i>

617
01:10:39,167 --> 01:10:41,167
Where's the river Rhine?

618
01:10:43,042 --> 01:10:45,042
I don't know.

619
01:10:45,208 --> 01:10:47,208
You should know that.

620
01:10:47,375 --> 01:10:50,333
- Why?
- Big battles there in the Great War.

621
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:55,500
Where's the river Seine?

622
01:10:57,167 --> 01:10:59,167
I don't know.

623
01:10:59,333 --> 01:11:02,792
I thought you were supposed
to have learnt these.

624
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:04,958
It's not what I'm on.

625
01:11:05,833 --> 01:11:09,083
It seems to be pretty relaxed,
this school of yours.

- What play?
- I don't know.

636

Some play.

01:12:23,208 --> 01:12:25,208
Maybe.

641
01:12:26,917 --> 01:12:28,917
I don't think it's a good idea.

642
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,917
You're depriving me of my civil rights.

643
01:12:33,083 --> 01:12:35,667
Where did you learn that language?

644
01:12:39,042 --> 01:12:41,042
I'm intelligent.

645
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,667
I have a right to be in a play if I want.

646
01:13:20,333 --> 01:13:22,333
Not if I say you don't.

647
01:13:37,875 --> 01:13:39,875
D'you like that?

648
01:13:45,208 --> 01:13:47,208
You want more, don't you?

649
01:14:05,458 --> 01:14:07,458
I want things, too.

650
01:14:09,417 --> 01:14:11,417
What?

651
01:14:13,125 --> 01:14:14,917
Things.

652
01:14:16,708 --> 01:14:19,417
You know how my allowance
is a dollar a week?

653
01:14:21,083 --> 01:14:23,083
Yes, I know.

654
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:25,667
Well, I think it should be two dollars.

655
01:14:34,833 --> 01:14:37,500
I said, I think it should be two dollars.

656
01:14:41,833 --> 01:14:43,750
A dollar fifty.

657
01:14:53,667 --> 01:14:56,375
I really do think it should be two dollars.

658
01:15:00,167 --> 01:15:01,375
Am I right?

659
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:04,625
Am I right?

660
01:15:07,083 --> 01:15:08,875
God, yes.

661
01:15:09,042 --> 01:15:10,833
Two dollars.

662
01:15:11,917 --> 01:15:14,292
And I get to be in the play.

663
01:15:18,833 --> 01:15:21,875
Oh, rosy mistress of the night.

664
01:15:22,042 --> 01:15:24,542
You have enchanted
many a hunter's heart.

665
01:15:24,708 --> 01:15:27,792
But this time, my temptress,...

666
01:15:27,958 --> 01:15:29,833
..you have met your match.

667
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,875
For far more than a hunter,...

668
01:15:33,042 --> 01:15:34,417
..I...

669
01:15:36,333 --> 01:15:38,000
..am a poet.

670
01:15:38,167 --> 01:15:41,792
- The night has fallen, Rodrigo.
- The...

671
01:15:41,958 --> 01:15:43,458
Hold it! Hold it! Mona...

672
01:15:43,625 --> 01:15:46,500
Give us a moment.
I'd like a word with Dolores.

673
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:52,625
When you say "your larking charms",
use your charms for the hunter.

674
01:15:52,792 --> 01:15:54,708
Because you're the witch.

675
01:15:54,875 --> 01:15:57,375
You're bringing the hunter to your lair.

676
01:15:59,167 --> 01:16:01,167
- Hi, Mr Humbert.
- Hello, Mona.

677
01:16:02,333 --> 01:16:04,125
Some play, huh?

678
01:16:04,292 --> 01:16:07,125
You're nymphs.
Use your nymph's charms.

679
01:16:07,292 --> 01:16:08,708
Seduce the hunter.

680
01:16:08,875 --> 01:16:10,875
Look. See right there?

681
01:16:11,792 --> 01:16:16,208
That's the actual playwright, Clare Quilty.
Can you believe it?

682
01:16:16,375 --> 01:16:18,833
Let the music transform you.

683
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,542
You'll feel that you've become a witch.

684
01:16:21,708 --> 01:16:25,417
- You're a witch!

685
01:16:25,583 --> 01:16:28,833
- This play any good, Mona?
- Yeah. It's very political.

686
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Witch! Witch!

687
01:16:31,167 --> 01:16:33,125
More wind! More wind!

688
01:16:33,292 --> 01:16:34,958
You're a witch!

689
01:16:35,125 --> 01:16:37,125
Aren't you?

690
01:16:37,292 --> 01:16:39,292
More wind! I need more wind!

691
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:42,708
The witches now! The witches' dance!

692
01:16:42,875 --> 01:16:44,250
In the wind!

693
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:52,042
<i>As she grew cooler
towards my advances,...</i>

694
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:55,542
<i>..I became accustomed
to purchasing her favours.</i>

695
01:16:56,375 --> 01:16:59,333
<i>Where she hid the money,
I never knew.</i>

696
01:17:00,292 --> 01:17:01,250
Stop it!

697
01:17:01,417 --> 01:17:05,958
<i>I was convinced she was storing it away
in order to finance her escape from me.</i>

698
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:12,500
You can't expect me to pay extra
in the middle!

699
01:17:12,667 --> 01:17:14,417
Ow! Argh!

700
01:17:14,583 --> 01:17:17,292
She's a lovely child, Mr Haze,...

701
01:17:17,458 --> 01:17:21,792
..but the onset of sexual maturing
seems to be giving her trouble.

702
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:26,167
- Isn't that your observation, Reverend?
- To the tee, Miss Pratt.

703
01:17:26,333 --> 01:17:30,792
So, you see, it is the general impression
that 14-year-old Dolores...

704
01:17:30,958 --> 01:17:35,167
..is morbidly disinterested
in sexual matters.

705
01:17:35,333 --> 01:17:38,583
Does she never speak
about these... matters?

706
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:40,417
Well...

707
01:17:40,583 --> 01:17:42,542
That's just it.

708
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:52,500
What's just it?

709
01:17:52,667 --> 01:17:54,667
That's... just it.

710
01:17:54,833 --> 01:17:57,042
She hasn't said anything.

711
01:17:57,208 --> 01:17:59,500
She hasn't breathed a word.

712
01:18:02,333 --> 01:18:04,333
Uh... But who has?

713
01:18:08,042 --> 01:18:10,833
Are... Are you saying that I've...

714
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Exactly.

715
01:18:13,167 --> 01:18:15,625
This is a very serious matter.

716
01:18:15,792 --> 01:18:17,875
What we're trying to say to you...

717
01:18:18,042 --> 01:18:20,458
..is that someone in the family,...

718
01:18:20,625 --> 01:18:22,833
..maybe you,...

719
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,583
This is very difficult for me.

720
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:27,792
Well, let me put it this way.

721
01:18:27,958 --> 01:18:31,958
Someone in the family
ought to instruct that dear child...

722
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:34,542
..in the process of human reproduction.

723
01:18:34,708 --> 01:18:36,375
I'm so sorry.

724
01:18:36,542 --> 01:18:39,333
- I'm so sorry.
- I see that I've embarrassed you.

725
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:43,000
Yet you, as her father,
ought to take the matter well in hand.

726
01:18:43,167 --> 01:18:46,208
Yes. Worry not, Miss Pratt.

727
01:18:48,542 --> 01:18:50,875
I... um... I have... this matter in hand.

728
01:18:51,042 --> 01:18:52,792
Oh, well,...

729
01:18:52,958 --> 01:18:55,500
..that's all I need to say.

730
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:07,708
Yes?

731
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,583
Oh, yes?

732
01:19:12,917 --> 01:19:14,500
She missed?

733
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,000
Oh.

734
01:19:18,583 --> 01:19:19,958
Bye.

735
01:19:28,083 --> 01:19:30,167
How are the piano lessons going?

736
01:19:30,333 --> 01:19:32,333
Fine.

737
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:35,417
Great. Excellent. Wonderful.

738
01:19:35,583 --> 01:19:37,583
Terrif. Perfect.

739
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:40,208
Especially since you missed the last two.

740
01:19:45,042 --> 01:19:47,042
Where were you?

741
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,500
Where was I?

742
01:19:54,667 --> 01:19:56,917
I should have told you before.

743
01:19:59,333 --> 01:20:02,750
I was in the park.
I was rehearsing the play with Mona.

744
01:20:02,917 --> 01:20:04,917
That's your story?

745
01:20:05,083 --> 01:20:07,083
That's what I was doing.

746
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
OK. Give me Mona's phone number.

747
01:20:10,167 --> 01:20:14,333
- Mona's phone number?
- Just give me Mona's phone number.

748
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:17,208
Klausen 57241.

749
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Is Mona there, please?

750
01:20:34,125 --> 01:20:38,250
- Mona, this is Dolores' father.
- Oh, hello, sir.

751
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:40,417
Mona, were you and Dolores...

752
01:20:40,583 --> 01:20:44,625
..rehearsing the play in the park
for the past two Tuesday afternoons?

753
01:20:44,792 --> 01:20:46,375
Um... Let's see.

754
01:20:46,542 --> 01:20:48,083
The last two Tuesdays?

755
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:51,708
One of them, Mona, was yesterday.

756
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:54,667
You know, sir, that's... absolutely right.

757
01:20:54,833 --> 01:20:56,833
I feel awfully bad about it.

758
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,875
I alone am to blame, sir.

759
01:20:59,042 --> 01:21:02,333
The whole rehearsing in the park thing
was my idea.

760
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,542
We did it cos we didn't want
to get on your nerves.

761
01:21:12,083 --> 01:21:14,083
Well?

762
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:16,542
Did she confirm?

763
01:21:16,708 --> 01:21:18,708
She did.

764
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:22,208
And I've no doubt
she'd been well instructed by you.

765
01:21:25,083 --> 01:21:28,750
In fact, I've no doubt
you've told her all about us.

766
01:21:35,667 --> 01:21:37,500
Look, Lo, this has got to stop.

767
01:21:37,667 --> 01:21:41,250
I don't know what you're up to,
but whatever it is,...

768
01:21:41,417 --> 01:21:46,250
..I'll yank you out of Beardsley as fast as
I can pack a suitcase unless this stops!

769
01:21:46,417 --> 01:21:47,792
Unless what stops?

770
01:21:47,958 --> 01:21:50,458
- You know what!
- Take it easy, mister!

771
01:21:50,625 --> 01:21:54,042
- Show me every penny...
- Leave me alone, you pervert!

772
01:21:54,208 --> 01:21:58,500
- You're running away from me, I know.
- Yes, I am! Anyone'd run away from you!

773
01:21:58,667 --> 01:22:01,125
- Show me what you hid!
- I earned that money!

774
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:10,792
Go ahead, murder me.
Like you murdered my mother.

775
01:22:10,958 --> 01:22:11,833
I'm sorry.

776
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,375
Murder me like you murdered my mother!

777
01:22:14,542 --> 01:22:15,542
Shut up. Shut up!

778
01:22:15,708 --> 01:22:18,250
Murder me like you murdered my mother!

779
01:22:18,417 --> 01:22:20,583
- Stop that!
- Go ahead! Murder me!

780
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:23,625
Go on, murder me!
I'm asking you to murder me!

781
01:22:23,792 --> 01:22:25,792
- Shut up!
- Murder me! Murder me!

782
01:22:25,958 --> 01:22:29,583
- Dolores, shut up!
- I hate you! I hate you!

783
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:31,750
Calm down.

784
01:22:31,917 --> 01:22:33,583
- Calm down!

785
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:36,625
- Come back, Lo!

786
01:22:36,792 --> 01:22:39,458
Murderer!

787
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:40,958
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

788
01:22:42,292 --> 01:22:44,125
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

789
01:22:52,083 --> 01:22:56,542
I do not know who you people think
you are, screaming and carrying on!

790
01:22:56,708 --> 01:23:00,042
My daughter's friend.
I'm sorry. I really can't stay.

791
01:24:25,208 --> 01:24:28,208
Oh, good. I was just trying
to reach you at home.

792
01:24:28,375 --> 01:24:31,250
- I've come to a decision.
- You have?

793
01:24:31,417 --> 01:24:33,208
Yeah.

794
01:24:33,375 --> 01:24:35,375
So buy me a drink.

795
01:24:35,542 --> 01:24:37,542
What would you like?

796
01:24:37,708 --> 01:24:39,875
Um... I'd like, uh, ice-cream soda...

797
01:24:40,042 --> 01:24:42,042
..with extra chocolate syrup.

798
01:24:42,208 --> 01:24:44,208
Please.

799
01:24:45,917 --> 01:24:48,583
Nothing for me, thanks.

800
01:25:02,625 --> 01:25:03,583
Lo...

801
01:25:24,792 --> 01:25:26,375
So tell me.

802
01:25:32,583 --> 01:25:34,875
What's the rush?

803
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:54,167
Pay her and let's blow this joint.

804
01:26:10,542 --> 01:26:12,542
<i>And do you know what she said,...</i>

805
01:26:12,708 --> 01:26:15,875
<i>..this girl who had been spurning me,
mocking me,...</i>

806
01:26:16,042 --> 01:26:19,125
<i>..plotting her escape from me
only hours before?</i>

807
01:26:19,292 --> 01:26:22,625
<i>She said she wanted
to leave Beardsley then and there.</i>

808
01:26:22,792 --> 01:26:25,000
<i>She wanted to take another trip,...</i>

809
01:26:25,167 --> 01:26:28,292
<i>..only this time she would choose
where we would go.</i>

810
01:26:28,458 --> 01:26:31,125
- OK? I choose? OK?
- Yes.

811
01:26:31,792 --> 01:26:34,208
<i>Did Humbert hum his assent?</i>

812
01:26:34,375 --> 01:26:36,375
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

813
01:26:36,542 --> 01:26:38,542
<i>I sealed my fate gratefully.</i>

814
01:27:19,833 --> 01:27:21,833
Lolita.

815
01:27:25,208 --> 01:27:27,458
Take me to bed.

816
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:52,000
Look out for cigarette hangover.

817
01:27:52,167 --> 01:27:53,833
<i>Hi. I'm Clare Quilty.</i>

818
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,333
<i>Remember, over a million smokers...</i>

819
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:58,500
So we have to be in...

820
01:27:59,542 --> 01:28:01,542
..Wace in exactly one week.

821
01:28:01,708 --> 01:28:03,792
But why Wace in a week?

822
01:28:03,958 --> 01:28:09,083
Cos we gotta see the... ceremonial dances
when they open the Magic Caves.

823
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:12,625
And... exactly two weeks
and four days later,...

824
01:28:12,792 --> 01:28:15,333
..we have to arrive in Elphinstone. See?

825
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:18,917
Yes.

826
01:28:19,083 --> 01:28:21,250
That's where we climb the Red Rock.

827
01:28:21,417 --> 01:28:25,250
We have to climb this rock
exactly two weeks and four days later?

828
01:28:25,417 --> 01:28:27,417
Exactly.

829
01:28:27,583 --> 01:28:29,583
Oh, I'm so excited.

830
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:57,708
<i>I cannot tell you the exact day I first knew
for certain that we were being followed.</i>

831
01:29:19,042 --> 01:29:23,125
Lo, reach into the glove compartment
and get the pad and pencil.

832
01:29:27,417 --> 01:29:30,292
Got it? Now write this down.

833
01:29:31,458 --> 01:29:33,250
Connecticut.

834
01:29:33,417 --> 01:29:34,792
How do you spell that?

835
01:29:34,958 --> 01:29:36,417
C-O-N-N.

836
01:29:36,583 --> 01:29:38,083
Is that it?

837
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:39,833
No. Now write down...

838
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,500
..PJ...

839
01:29:41,667 --> 01:29:43,625
..44...

840
01:29:43,792 --> 01:29:45,667
..396.

841
01:29:47,125 --> 01:29:48,875
All right, give it to me.

842
01:29:54,625 --> 01:29:56,167
All right.

843
01:29:56,333 --> 01:29:59,750
Put it in the glove box.
Don't put gum on it cos it'll get...

844
01:29:59,917 --> 01:30:02,250
Why have you got your gum everywhere?

845
01:30:02,417 --> 01:30:04,042
Put that in the glove box.

846
01:30:05,042 --> 01:30:07,125
There's a detective following us.

847
01:30:09,625 --> 01:30:12,042
He looks rather like my Uncle Gustave.

848
01:30:23,667 --> 01:30:25,667
<i>He was clever, our pursuer.</i>

849
01:30:25,833 --> 01:30:27,833
<i>He kept changing cars.</i>

850
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,208
<i>But his presence was as real to me...</i>

851
01:30:30,375 --> 01:30:32,375
<i>..as my own breath.</i>

852
01:30:38,083 --> 01:30:42,917
<i>Then suddenly he would disappear
and I'd wonder if I'd imagined everything.</i>

853
01:32:00,667 --> 01:32:02,417
Lo! What did that man say to you?

854
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:05,625
# Bags around your eyeballs
which is red instead of white

855
01:32:05,792 --> 01:32:08,875
- What did he say to you?
- The guy I was talking to?

856
01:32:09,042 --> 01:32:11,708
- Yeah. Look...
- # Shucks, I shoulda known...

857
01:32:11,833 --> 01:32:13,833
Just tell me what he said to you.

858
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,875
He asked me if I had a map.
He must've been lost.

859
01:32:17,042 --> 01:32:19,042
# My heart's plumb gone

860
01:32:19,208 --> 01:32:21,458
# Cos you used temptation

861
01:32:22,667 --> 01:32:25,792
# It'd be thrilling... if 'n you're willing

862
01:32:25,958 --> 01:32:30,625
Look, I've told you about
talking to strangers. You've no idea...

863
01:32:30,792 --> 01:32:32,792
Lo, listen to me.

864
01:32:32,958 --> 01:32:36,625
You're very young
and people can take advantage of you.

865
01:32:36,792 --> 01:32:38,792
Very hard to imagine.

866
01:32:38,958 --> 01:32:41,750
That man was the cop
who's been following us.

867
01:32:41,917 --> 01:32:44,708
You have to tell me
exactly what you told him.

868
01:32:44,875 --> 01:32:49,292
If he really is a cop, the worst thing
we can do is let him know we're scared.

869
01:32:49,458 --> 01:32:51,625
Then he'll know that we're guilty.

870
01:32:51,792 --> 01:32:53,792
Or rather, that you're guilty.

871
01:33:03,458 --> 01:33:07,917
<i># Don't sit under the apple tree
with anyone else but me...</i>

872
01:33:16,208 --> 01:33:18,208
# With anyone else but me

873
01:33:18,375 --> 01:33:21,167
# With anyone else but me, no, no, no

874
01:33:48,417 --> 01:33:50,583
# With anyone else but me, no, no, no

875
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:52,667
# Anyone else but you

876
01:33:52,833 --> 01:33:55,833
# No, no, don't go under the apple tree

877
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:03,583
There's something wrong
with the steering.

878
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:05,833
Oh, whoa!

879
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,333
Ow! Watch it!

880
01:34:08,458 --> 01:34:10,292
What are you doing?!

881
01:34:15,917 --> 01:34:17,792
You got a flat, mister.

882
01:34:49,375 --> 01:34:51,375
<i># Open the door, and let me in</i>

883
01:34:57,458 --> 01:34:59,625
<i># Richard, why don't you open the door?</i>

884
01:35:13,083 --> 01:35:14,583
Hey...

885
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:16,333
Hey!

886
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,292
Hey, you! Come back here!

887
01:35:20,875 --> 01:35:21,833
Lo!

888
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,375
Lo! Lo!

889
01:35:23,542 --> 01:35:24,500
Lo!

890
01:35:24,667 --> 01:35:26,083
Put on the handbrake!

891
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:28,792
Pull the handbrake up! Lo!

892
01:35:31,042 --> 01:35:34,167
Lo! Pull on the handbrake. Stop the car.

893
01:35:34,333 --> 01:35:37,250
Put the handbrake on. Down there! Pull it!

894
01:35:37,417 --> 01:35:38,917
- Ow!

895
01:35:40,292 --> 01:35:41,375
Jesus Christ!

896
01:35:41,542 --> 01:35:44,250
What did you think you were doing?

897
01:35:44,417 --> 01:35:46,417
You should thank me.

898
01:35:46,583 --> 01:35:48,833
The car was rolling and I stopped it.

899
01:35:51,667 --> 01:35:54,333
You should thank me.

900
01:35:58,167 --> 01:36:01,042
Pass me the pad
in the glove compartment.

901
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:06,333
It was smart of us
to write his number down.

902
01:36:09,792 --> 01:36:11,167
What...?

903
01:36:11,333 --> 01:36:13,000
What have you...

904
01:36:25,125 --> 01:36:26,708
Lo...

905
01:36:41,042 --> 01:36:43,042
Lo...

906
01:36:48,292 --> 01:36:50,292
Lo, I'm sorry.

907
01:36:50,458 --> 01:36:53,125
- I'm sorry!

908
01:37:00,833 --> 01:37:03,500
Come here. Come here.

909
01:37:03,625 --> 01:37:05,625
Get away!

910
01:37:07,125 --> 01:37:09,333
Lo...

911
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:11,500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

912
01:37:11,667 --> 01:37:13,125
I'm sorry.

913
01:37:38,042 --> 01:37:41,125
Shall I walk down to the town
and get you some fruit?

914
01:37:42,250 --> 01:37:44,250
Bananas.

915
01:37:53,125 --> 01:37:55,125
Just bananas?

916
01:37:56,458 --> 01:37:59,375
Just bananas.

You've been out.

928
01:39:28,958 --> 01:39:30,958
I just got up.

929
01:39:36,083 --> 01:39:38,083
Don't lie to me.

930
01:39:42,250 --> 01:39:44,250
Well, I did go out for a second.

931
01:39:45,458 --> 01:39:49,250
You were gone so long.
I wanted to see if you were coming back.

932
01:40:39,042 --> 01:40:42,000
You tell me who it is! Who is it?

933
01:40:42,167 --> 01:40:44,667
Who is it? Tell me who it is.

934

You tell me. Who is it?

935

Who...?

936
01:40:51,167 --> 01:40:53,958
- Tell me.

937
01:40:54,125 --> 01:40:55,208
Please, tell me.

938
01:41:07,417 --> 01:41:09,042
Please tell me.

939
01:41:09,208 --> 01:41:11,208
Please tell me.

940
01:41:22,958 --> 01:41:24,750
Please tell me.

01:41:26,917 --> 01:41:28,458
Please!

942
01:41:28,625 --> 01:41:30,458
Please... tell... me!

I'll show you to room number 29.

950
01:43:31,250 --> 01:43:33,250
It's one of our nicer rooms.

951
01:43:33,417 --> 01:43:36,792
Say, what's wrong
with your little daughter? Is she ill?

952
01:43:36,958 --> 01:43:39,375
Oh, no. She's just feeling a bit... um...

953
01:43:43,333 --> 01:43:44,917
My God, Lo!

954
01:43:45,083 --> 01:43:46,667
Are you all right?

955
01:43:47,667 --> 01:43:50,333
I don't feel... I don't feel very well.

956
01:43:51,167 --> 01:43:53,167
It's a virus.

957
01:43:53,333 --> 01:43:56,417
Nothing serious.
I've had 40 cases in two weeks.

958
01:43:56,583 --> 01:44:00,250
- So can I take her home?
- We're gonna keep her here overnight.

959
01:44:00,417 --> 01:44:02,583
Keep her hydrated, help her sleep.

960
01:44:13,792 --> 01:44:17,333
Why don't you get some sleep?
It won't help if you catch it.

961
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:19,958
I think I have already.
I feel dreadful.

962
01:44:20,125 --> 01:44:22,125
- Maybe I should stay.
- Go.

963
01:44:22,292 --> 01:44:24,208
Call us in the morning.

964
01:44:24,375 --> 01:44:26,583
- Here, I'll take those.
- Thank you.

965
01:44:56,542 --> 01:44:58,667
Uh, yes, hello. This is Mr Humbert.

966
01:44:58,833 --> 01:45:02,750
I'm calling to see how my... daughter,
Dolores Haze, is.

967
01:45:02,917 --> 01:45:04,917
Oh, she's much better.

968
01:45:05,083 --> 01:45:07,375
She was up early. No trace of fever.

969
01:45:07,542 --> 01:45:10,792
And when Uncle Gustave came for her,
we signed her out.

970
01:45:12,542 --> 01:45:15,208
Who? Wh... Wh... Who?

971
01:45:15,333 --> 01:45:17,583
Uncle Gustave, Dolores called him.

972
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:21,375
He had a sweet little dog.
He was the nicest man. Had a big smile.

973
01:45:21,542 --> 01:45:22,917
Wait, Ted.

974
01:45:23,083 --> 01:45:27,125
- And you let her go with him?
- Oh, yes. He paid the bill in cash.

975
01:45:27,292 --> 01:45:32,125
They said to tell you not to worry,
and they'll be at Grandpa's expecting you.

976
01:45:32,292 --> 01:45:35,958
- Then they went off in that nice Cadillac.

977
01:45:36,125 --> 01:45:38,125
Hello?

978
01:45:56,208 --> 01:45:57,750
Hey!

979
01:45:57,917 --> 01:45:59,583
Hey!

980
01:46:09,458 --> 01:46:10,417
Nurse!

981
01:46:10,583 --> 01:46:12,583
- Where is she?
- Who?

982
01:46:12,750 --> 01:46:15,208
Who took her?
Somebody took my daughter.

983
01:46:15,375 --> 01:46:18,333
- You need to talk to the doctor.
- But who took her?

984
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:20,667
My daughter was in there last night.

985
01:46:20,833 --> 01:46:23,125
- Who took her away?
- Hey, relax, pal!

986
01:46:23,292 --> 01:46:26,750
Don't tell me to relax!
I'm looking for my daughter! Doctor!

987
01:46:26,917 --> 01:46:28,625
Doctor! Doctor!

988
01:46:28,792 --> 01:46:30,792
What have you done with her?

989
01:46:30,958 --> 01:46:33,042
Where is she? Where is she?

990
01:46:33,250 --> 01:46:35,958
Tell me where she is! Where is she?

991
01:46:36,125 --> 01:46:38,708
Where has she gone?
Where? Where? Where?

992
01:46:41,167 --> 01:46:43,250
You leave me alone, you bastards!

993
01:46:43,417 --> 01:46:45,125
You fucking fiends!

994
01:46:45,292 --> 01:46:47,292
Tell me where she is!

995
01:46:49,542 --> 01:46:51,542
Get me to that man!

996
01:46:53,417 --> 01:46:55,958
I'm just looking for my daughter!

997
01:46:57,125 --> 01:47:00,667
- I said relax!
- I want to know where she -

998
01:47:02,625 --> 01:47:05,333
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

999
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:06,958
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1000
01:47:07,125 --> 01:47:08,833
Sorry.

1001
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,167
I'm sorry. I'm just a little bit...

1002
01:47:11,333 --> 01:47:15,208
I think I may just have...
had a little too much to drink. Sorry.

1003
01:47:15,375 --> 01:47:18,667
I'm very worried
about my daughter, you see.

1004
01:47:18,833 --> 01:47:21,292
But she's with her Uncle Gustave.

1005
01:47:21,458 --> 01:47:23,458
So she'll be all right.

1006
01:47:23,625 --> 01:47:25,792
I'm very sorry. Please forgive me.

1007
01:47:25,958 --> 01:47:28,292
She's gone to her... grandpa's farm.

1008
01:47:29,417 --> 01:47:31,500
She'll be absolutely fine there.

1009
01:47:31,667 --> 01:47:33,667
What better place for her?

1010
01:47:33,833 --> 01:47:36,167
I'm... I'm fine.

1011
01:47:36,333 --> 01:47:38,333
Please, I'm sorry.

1012
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:40,500
So sorry. Thank you very much.

1013
01:47:40,667 --> 01:47:42,667
Sorry... Sorry.

1014
01:47:42,833 --> 01:47:44,833
So sorry.

1015
01:47:59,875 --> 01:48:01,875
<i>I searched all our old haunts...</i>

1016
01:48:02,042 --> 01:48:05,625
<i>..and for several months
the trail remained warm.</i>

1017
01:48:08,208 --> 01:48:12,583
<i>The thief, the kidnapper,
whatever you want to call him,...</i>

1018
01:48:12,750 --> 01:48:14,417
<i>..he was clever.</i>

1019
01:48:14,583 --> 01:48:16,583
<i>He would disguise his name.</i>

1020
01:48:16,750 --> 01:48:19,292
<i>But I could always tell his handwriting.</i>

1021
01:48:20,792 --> 01:48:22,583
Um... Sir!

1022
01:48:26,833 --> 01:48:28,917
<i>He had very peculiar Ts, Ws and Ls.</i>

1023
01:48:29,083 --> 01:48:31,583
Do you know his name?

1024
01:48:33,167 --> 01:48:35,167
What does he look like?

1025
01:48:37,625 --> 01:48:39,625
- Let me help.
- No, please...

1026
01:48:41,625 --> 01:48:44,208
Ladies, I'm sorry. We're trying to find...

1027
01:48:44,375 --> 01:48:47,625
<i>It must be hard
for you who already know who it was...</i>

1028
01:48:47,792 --> 01:48:50,042
<i>..to understand my mystification.</i>

1029
01:48:58,625 --> 01:49:01,292
<i>Or maybe you think
I was imagining things.</i>

1030
01:49:01,458 --> 01:49:03,042
..my daughter.

1031
01:49:04,333 --> 01:49:09,042
<i>Maybe you think it impossible that
there could have been another like me.</i>

1032
01:49:09,208 --> 01:49:14,000
<i>Another mad lover of nymphets following
us over the great and ugly plains.</i>

1033
01:49:14,167 --> 01:49:16,375
<i>Well, you are right, of course.</i>

1034
01:49:16,542 --> 01:49:18,542
<i>There was no-one else like me.</i>

1035
01:49:27,792 --> 01:49:30,333
<i>Eventually the trail went cold and dead.</i>

1036
01:49:34,625 --> 01:49:37,292
<i>And I went back to cold, dead Beardsley.</i>

1037
01:50:31,917 --> 01:50:34,792
"Dear Dad, how's everything?"

1038
01:50:35,792 --> 01:50:38,208
"I'm married. I'm going to have a baby."

1039
01:50:40,542 --> 01:50:43,250
"I guess it'll come
right around Christmas."

1040
01:50:45,208 --> 01:50:47,333
"This is a hard letter to write."

1041
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:50,458
"I'm going nuts
because we don't have enough...

1042
01:50:50,625 --> 01:50:52,958
..to pay our debts and get out of here."

1043
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:57,250
"Dick has been promised
a big job in Alaska."

1044
01:50:59,833 --> 01:51:01,833
"Are you still mad at me?"

1045
01:51:03,042 --> 01:51:07,958
"Please send us a cheque, Dad. We could
manage with three or four hundred,...

1046
01:51:08,125 --> 01:51:10,500
..or even less. Anything is welcome."

1047
01:51:11,292 --> 01:51:14,458
"I have gone through
much sadness and hardship."

1048
01:51:14,625 --> 01:51:16,625
"Yours expecting, Dolly."

1049
01:51:18,292 --> 01:51:20,292
"Mrs Richard F...

1050
01:51:22,417 --> 01:51:24,417
..Schiller."

1051
01:52:43,750 --> 01:52:46,125
Well!

1052
01:53:16,958 --> 01:53:18,958
Come in.

1053
01:53:31,917 --> 01:53:33,917
You, Molly, stay out.

1054
01:53:34,083 --> 01:53:35,917
Good girl.

1055
01:53:36,083 --> 01:53:38,500
Husband at home?

1056
01:53:38,667 --> 01:53:40,458
Yeah.

1057
01:53:40,625 --> 01:53:43,583
Where do you wanna sit?
The rocker or the divan?

1058
01:53:44,667 --> 01:53:46,667
Come sit with me on the divan.

1059
01:53:53,542 --> 01:53:55,125
Is that him?

1060
01:53:56,583 --> 01:53:58,542
Up the ladder?

1061
01:53:58,708 --> 01:54:01,375
You want me to call him in?

1062
01:54:02,292 --> 01:54:04,042
No.

1063
01:54:04,208 --> 01:54:06,875
He's not the one I want.

1064
01:54:08,625 --> 01:54:10,917
He's not the what?

1065
01:54:11,083 --> 01:54:13,208
You know what I mean.

1066
01:54:13,375 --> 01:54:15,583
Where is he?

1067
01:54:15,750 --> 01:54:17,750
Look...

1068
01:54:18,333 --> 01:54:22,875
Dick has nothing to do with all that stuff.
He thinks you're my father.

1069
01:54:23,042 --> 01:54:25,292
Please don't bring up all that muck.

1070
01:54:27,042 --> 01:54:30,375
- All right, I'll find out myself.
- You really don't know?

1071
01:54:37,625 --> 01:54:39,625
My God, Dad, it was Quilty.

1072
01:54:39,792 --> 01:54:41,917
It was Clare Quilty.

1073
01:54:50,042 --> 01:54:52,042
Yes.

1074
01:54:57,542 --> 01:54:59,667
Yes, of course.

1075
01:55:18,708 --> 01:55:20,500
Quilty.

1076
01:55:21,625 --> 01:55:23,625
Yeah.

1077
01:55:25,833 --> 01:55:29,500
He was the only man
I was ever really crazy about.

1078
01:55:34,292 --> 01:55:36,500
What about me?

1079
01:56:04,042 --> 01:56:06,042
Where did he take you?

1080
01:56:10,083 --> 01:56:12,333
Just tell me.

1081
01:56:13,542 --> 01:56:16,375
Well, everybody knew he liked little girls.

1082
01:56:16,542 --> 01:56:21,417
He used to film them in his mansion
over in Parkington, Pavor Manor.

1083
01:56:23,875 --> 01:56:27,042
But I wasn't gonna do all those things.

1084
01:56:28,542 --> 01:56:30,542
All what things?

1085
01:56:30,708 --> 01:56:32,792
Two girls and two boys or...

1086
01:56:32,958 --> 01:56:35,042
..I don't know, three or four men.

1087
01:56:35,208 --> 01:56:37,667
And Vivian was filming the whole thing.

1088
01:56:37,833 --> 01:56:41,667
I said "No, I'm not gonna blow
all those beastly boys."

1089
01:56:41,833 --> 01:56:43,958
"I want you."

1090
01:56:47,292 --> 01:56:49,167
So he threw me out.

1091
01:56:58,917 --> 01:57:00,917
<i>I looked and looked at her...</i>

1092
01:57:02,958 --> 01:57:06,250
<i>..and I knew,
as clearly as I know that I will die,...</i>

1093
01:57:06,417 --> 01:57:11,000
<i>..that I loved her more than anything
I'd ever seen or imagined on earth.</i>

1094
01:57:15,125 --> 01:57:19,083
<i>She was only the dead leaf echo
of the nymphet from long ago...</i>

1095
01:57:20,333 --> 01:57:22,708
<i>..but I loved her, this Lolita,...</i>

1096
01:57:22,875 --> 01:57:26,333
<i>..pale and polluted
and big with another man's child.</i>

1097
01:57:26,500 --> 01:57:29,667
<i>She could fade and wither - I didn't care.</i>

1098
01:57:31,667 --> 01:57:34,333
<i>I would still go mad with tenderness...</i>

1099
01:57:34,458 --> 01:57:36,458
<i>..at the mere sight of her face.</i>

1100
01:57:59,958 --> 01:58:01,958
Lolita...

1101
01:58:04,250 --> 01:58:08,333
From here to that old car
that you know so well...

1102
01:58:08,500 --> 01:58:10,750
..is a stretch of 25 paces.

1103
01:58:13,542 --> 01:58:16,042
Make those 25 steps...

1104
01:58:16,208 --> 01:58:18,208
..with me, now.

1105
01:58:18,375 --> 01:58:22,792
You're saying you'll give us some money
if I go to a motel with you?

1106
01:58:22,958 --> 01:58:24,917
No... No!

1107
01:58:25,083 --> 01:58:29,583
I'm saying leave here and come live
with me, die with me, everything with me.

1108
01:58:30,750 --> 01:58:32,750
You're crazy.

1109
01:58:32,917 --> 01:58:35,625
If you refuse, you still get the money.

1110
01:58:35,792 --> 01:58:37,208
- Really?
- Yeah.

1111
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
There. Have it.

1112
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:51,875
Oh my God.

1113
01:58:52,042 --> 01:58:55,333
You're giving us four thousand bucks?

1114
01:58:58,583 --> 01:59:00,208
- Thank you...
- No...

1115
01:59:00,375 --> 01:59:02,375
Don't touch me.

1116
01:59:02,542 --> 01:59:04,542
I'll die if you touch me.

1117
01:59:05,875 --> 01:59:10,583
Just tell me...
there's a chance you'll come with me.

1118
01:59:12,375 --> 01:59:14,375
No, honey.

1119
01:59:14,542 --> 01:59:16,875
I'd almost rather go back with Clare.

1120
01:59:20,333 --> 01:59:22,333
Oh...

1121
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:24,500
I'll go now.

1122
01:59:26,625 --> 01:59:30,958
- Can I call Dick in to say goodbye?
- No. I don't want to see him, at all.

1123
01:59:31,125 --> 01:59:34,167
I just want to go.

1124
01:59:43,625 --> 01:59:46,833
Lo, can you ever forget
what I've done to you?

1125
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Say goodbye, Molly.

1126
01:59:55,083 --> 01:59:57,083
Say goodbye to my dad.

1127
02:01:04,292 --> 02:01:06,375
Dick! Guess what!

1128
02:01:27,292 --> 02:01:29,625
<i>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,...</i>

1129
02:01:29,792 --> 02:01:34,708
<i>..I have to say that I regret all I did
before that last goodbye in Coalmont.</i>

1130
02:01:36,750 --> 02:01:40,333
<i>But I regret nothing of what came after.</i>

1131
02:03:16,208 --> 02:03:18,208
Now, who are you?

1132
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,083
Are you, by any chance, Brewster?

1133
02:03:30,458 --> 02:03:33,250
You know, you don't look
like Jack Brewster.

1134
02:03:33,417 --> 02:03:36,917
I mean, the resemblance
is not particularly striking.

1135
02:03:37,083 --> 02:03:41,583
Somebody told me he had a brother
with the same phone company.

1136
02:03:41,750 --> 02:03:43,750
I'm neither of the Brewsters.

1137
02:03:50,792 --> 02:03:52,292
Pull over!

1138
02:03:53,375 --> 02:03:54,875
Pull over!

1139
02:03:58,083 --> 02:04:00,500
Do you recall a little girl named...

1140
02:04:02,333 --> 02:04:04,125
..Dolores Haze?

1141
02:04:08,333 --> 02:04:10,750
You see, I'm her father.

1142
02:04:12,125 --> 02:04:13,625
Nonsense.

1143
02:04:13,792 --> 02:04:17,250
You're a foreigner.
You're an agent of a foreign power.

1144
02:04:17,417 --> 02:04:19,500
You're a foreign literary agent.

1145
02:04:19,667 --> 02:04:22,083
She was my daughter.

1146
02:04:22,250 --> 02:04:24,250
She was my child.

1147
02:04:24,417 --> 02:04:26,792
Oh, you know,
I adore children myself.

1148
02:04:26,958 --> 02:04:28,958
And fathers...

1149
02:04:29,125 --> 02:04:31,167
I love fathers.

1150
02:04:34,708 --> 02:04:36,500
Ah...

1151
02:04:36,667 --> 02:04:37,625
Sit down!

1152
02:04:39,333 --> 02:04:41,333
Oh. There they are.

1153
02:04:41,500 --> 02:04:43,750
Now we need matches.
You got a light?

1154
02:04:43,917 --> 02:04:46,500
Quilty, I want you to concentrate.

1155
02:04:49,875 --> 02:04:51,542
You're about to die.

1156
02:04:51,708 --> 02:04:54,042
Ooh.

1157
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:03,583
Jesus!

1158
02:05:04,958 --> 02:05:09,250
Do you want to be executed
standing up or sitting down?

1159
02:05:09,417 --> 02:05:12,833
Just let me think, let me think.
It's not an easy question.

1160
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,458
Try to understand what is happening.

1161
02:05:15,625 --> 02:05:16,458
I- I- I- I...

1162
02:05:16,625 --> 02:05:20,000
- Remember Dolores Haze.
- I'm willing...

1163
02:05:20,167 --> 02:05:23,500
I'm willing to try. I am. Just...

1164
02:05:23,667 --> 02:05:25,333
OK. Listen.

1165
02:05:25,500 --> 02:05:27,500
I made a mistake, which I regret,...

1166
02:05:27,667 --> 02:05:29,583
..sincerely.

1167
02:05:29,750 --> 02:05:35,250
I couldn't have any fun with your Dolly.
I'm practically impotent is the sad truth.

1168
02:05:35,417 --> 02:05:40,125
But she had a swell vacation, met some
remarkable people. Hey, do you know -

1169
02:05:54,833 --> 02:05:56,292
Stay still!

1170
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:59,958
Oh, God...

1171
02:06:00,792 --> 02:06:02,792
You cheated me.

1172
02:06:05,417 --> 02:06:07,417
You cheated me of my redemption.

1173
02:06:09,917 --> 02:06:13,583
- You have to die.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1174
02:06:13,750 --> 02:06:17,583
My memory and my eloquence
are not at their best today.

1175
02:06:17,750 --> 02:06:22,083
But really, you have to admit
you were never an ideal stepfather.

1176
02:06:22,250 --> 02:06:24,250
Hm?

1177
02:06:24,417 --> 02:06:26,875
I did not force your protégée to join me.

1178
02:06:27,042 --> 02:06:30,042
It was she who made me
remove her to a happier home.

1179
02:06:30,208 --> 02:06:32,500
Look around you. See?

1180
02:06:32,667 --> 02:06:34,667
You see this house?

1181
02:06:34,833 --> 02:06:39,417
It's very cool in the summer. Comfortable.
I suggest that you move in, hm?

1182
02:06:42,250 --> 02:06:44,458
I think you'll be happy here.

1183
02:06:45,542 --> 02:06:47,542
You can use my wardrobe.

1184
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:51,667
We have the most reliable
and bribable charwoman.

1185
02:06:51,833 --> 02:06:54,292
"Cleaning lady" is the American term.

1186
02:06:54,458 --> 02:06:58,042
She has not only daughters,
she has granddaughters.

1187
02:06:58,208 --> 02:07:01,500
And I know a thing or two
about the chief of police...

1188
02:07:01,667 --> 02:07:03,708
..that makes him my slave.

1189
02:07:03,875 --> 02:07:05,958
My slave. Drop the gun.

1190
02:07:06,125 --> 02:07:08,625
And here's another thing...--
Drop the gun.

1191
02:07:08,792 --> 02:07:12,667
...I have, upstairs,
the most unique collection of erotica.

1192
02:07:12,833 --> 02:07:14,208
Drop the gun. Drop the gun.

1193
02:07:14,375 --> 02:07:18,500
Also, moreover, I can arrange
for you to attend executions.

1194
02:07:18,667 --> 02:07:21,667
Not everybody knows
the chair is painted yellow.

1195
02:07:24,167 --> 02:07:25,542
Somebody help!

1196
02:08:31,125 --> 02:08:32,792
Aargh! Agh!

1197
02:08:33,792 --> 02:08:35,792
That hurts, sir.

1198
02:08:35,958 --> 02:08:38,542
That hurts atrociously, my dear fellow.

1199
02:08:49,208 --> 02:08:51,208
God...

1200
02:08:51,375 --> 02:08:54,458
You should not continue
in this fashion, really.

1201
02:09:25,125 --> 02:09:26,917
Get out!

1202
02:09:27,083 --> 02:09:28,750
Get out of here!

1203
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:41,375
<i>What I heard then was
the melody of children at play.</i>

1204
02:11:41,542 --> 02:11:43,542
<i>Nothing but that.</i>

1205
02:11:45,917 --> 02:11:49,083
<i>And I knew that
the hopelessly poignant thing...</i>

1206
02:11:49,250 --> 02:11:52,083
<i>..was not Lolita's absence from my side...</i>

1207
02:11:53,750 --> 02:11:56,792
<i>..but the absence of her voice
from that chorus.</i>

1208
02:16:16,958 --> 02:16:19,917
<i># When I was a kid about half past three</i>

1209

1220

1221
