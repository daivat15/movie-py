1
00:02:41,713 --> 00:02:43,291
Have you seen...
I was told that if...

2
00:02:43,382 --> 00:02:46,299
I was late again I would be
summarily dismissed.

3
00:03:35,977 --> 00:03:37,685
Mmm. No, no.

4
00:03:54,162 --> 00:03:55,620
Just a moment.

5
00:03:56,957 --> 00:03:59,448
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

6
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:00,823
Just a moment.

7
00:04:02,088 --> 00:04:04,412
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

8
00:04:04,506 --> 00:04:05,917
Just a moment.

9
00:04:07,926 --> 00:04:10,251
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

10
00:04:10,345 --> 00:04:11,674
Just a moment.

11
00:04:12,723 --> 00:04:14,763
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

12
00:04:15,643 --> 00:04:17,101
Just a moment.

13
00:04:17,186 --> 00:04:19,178
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

14
00:04:20,022 --> 00:04:22,311
Hello, Peter. What's happening?

15
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,519
Ahh... we have
sort of a problem here.

16
00:04:25,611 --> 00:04:28,018
Yeah.
You apparently didn't put...

17
00:04:28,113 --> 00:04:30,439
one of the new cover sheets
on your T.P.S. Reports.

18
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:34,365
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry about that.
L... I forgot.

19
00:04:34,453 --> 00:04:36,281
Mmm... yeah.

20
00:04:36,373 --> 00:04:37,831
You see, we're putting
the cover sheets...

21
00:04:37,914 --> 00:04:40,786
on all T.P.S. Reports now
before they go out.

22
00:04:40,877 --> 00:04:43,628
Did you see the memo
about this?

23
00:04:43,713 --> 00:04:46,963
Yeah. Yeah,
I have the memo right here.

24
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,460
I just, uh, forgot...

25
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:50,924
but, uh, it's not shipping out
till tomorrow...

26
00:04:51,013 --> 00:04:52,422
so there's no problem.

27
00:04:52,513 --> 00:04:54,257
Yeah.

28
00:04:54,349 --> 00:04:55,724
If you could just go ahead
and make sure...

29
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:58,975
you do that from now on,
that would be great...

30
00:04:59,061 --> 00:05:00,971
and, uh, I'll go ahead
and make sure...

31
00:05:01,064 --> 00:05:03,187
you get another copy
of that memo, OK?

32
00:05:03,274 --> 00:05:06,275
No. I have the memo.
I've got it... lt's right...

33
00:05:06,361 --> 00:05:08,934
Hello, Phil. What's happening?

34
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,110
Um...

35
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,234
I came by here yesterday...

36
00:05:13,326 --> 00:05:16,162
Four teams
out on the Spanish point...

37
00:05:16,246 --> 00:05:18,405
discovered a shipwreck
off the coast...

38
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:19,662
Milton?

39
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:21,828
Hi. Uh...

40
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:23,911
could you turn that down
just a little bit?

41
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:26,211
But I was told
that I could listen...

42
00:05:26,299 --> 00:05:28,919
to the radio at a reasonable
volume from 9:00 to 11:00.

43
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:31,501
Yeah. I know you're allowed to.

44
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:34,964
I was just thinkin'
maybe like a personal favour.

45
00:05:35,057 --> 00:05:38,675
Well, l... l...I told Bill
if Sandra's going to...

46
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:42,184
listen to her headphones
while she's filing...

47
00:05:42,272 --> 00:05:43,850
then I should be able
to listen to the radio...

48
00:05:43,941 --> 00:05:45,352
while I'm collating...

49
00:05:45,443 --> 00:05:47,435
so I don't see why I should have
to turn down the radio.

50
00:05:47,528 --> 00:05:48,607
Yeah. All right. OK.

51
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:50,819
I enjoy listening
at a reasonable volume...

52
00:05:50,907 --> 00:05:51,986
Thanks.

53
00:05:52,074 --> 00:05:53,403
From 9:00 to 11:00.

54
00:05:53,493 --> 00:05:54,904
Hi, Peter.

55
00:05:54,995 --> 00:05:56,951
What's happening?

56
00:05:57,037 --> 00:05:59,529
We need to talk
about your T.P.S. Reports.

57
00:05:59,624 --> 00:06:01,949
Yeah. The cover sheet.
I know. I know.

58
00:06:02,043 --> 00:06:03,122
Bill talked to me about it.

59
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,749
Yeah. Did you get that memo?

60
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,081
Yeah, I got the memo,
and I understand the policy...

61
00:06:08,175 --> 00:06:10,748
and the problem is just
that I forgot the one time...

62
00:06:10,844 --> 00:06:12,670
and I've already
taken care of it...

63
00:06:12,762 --> 00:06:14,471
so it's not even really
a problem anymore.

64
00:06:14,556 --> 00:06:17,342
Ah! Yeah.

65
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:18,928
It's just we're putting
new cover sheets...

66
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:21,426
on all the T.P.S. Reports
before they go out now...

67
00:06:21,521 --> 00:06:23,893
so if you could go ahead
and try to remember...

68
00:06:23,982 --> 00:06:26,555
to do that from now on,
that'd be great.

69
00:06:26,651 --> 00:06:27,814
All right!

70
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:34,401
Just a moment.

71
00:06:35,827 --> 00:06:38,283
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

72
00:06:38,372 --> 00:06:39,570
Peter Gibbons.

73
00:06:40,665 --> 00:06:41,745
Yes.

74
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,708
Corporate accounts
payable. Nina speaking.

75
00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:44,873
Just a moment.

76
00:06:44,962 --> 00:06:46,372
I have the memo.

77
00:06:48,299 --> 00:06:50,209
No. Not again. L...

78
00:06:50,302 --> 00:06:52,589
Why does it say paper jam
when there is no paper jam?

79
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,636
I swear to God,
one of these days...

80
00:06:54,722 --> 00:06:57,759
I just kick this piece of shit
out the window.

81
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,759
You and me both, man.

82
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,050
That thing is lucky
I'm not armed.

83
00:07:03,481 --> 00:07:04,513
Piece of shit.

84
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:06,480
PEGG "Samir...

85
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,068
"Na-Na...

86
00:07:09,154 --> 00:07:10,897
"Na-Naga..."

87
00:07:10,988 --> 00:07:12,732
- No. Thanks.
- Unh-huh!

88
00:07:12,823 --> 00:07:14,069
Please.

89
00:07:14,158 --> 00:07:17,243
"Michael... Bolton"?

90
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:18,492
That's me.

91
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,655
Wow! Is that your real name?

92
00:07:20,748 --> 00:07:22,159
Yeah. Ahem.

93
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:24,998
So are you related
to that singer guy?

94
00:07:25,086 --> 00:07:26,877
No.
It's just a coincidence.

95
00:07:26,963 --> 00:07:28,126
Oh.

96
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:32,837
No one in this country
can pronounce my name right.

97
00:07:33,637 --> 00:07:35,047
It's not that hard.

98
00:07:35,138 --> 00:07:37,261
"Na-ee" and then "anajaad."
Nayanajaad.

99
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:39,342
At least your name
isn't Michael Bolton.

100
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,226
You know, there's
nothing wrong with that name.

101
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:44,222
There was
nothing wrong with it...

102
00:07:44,315 --> 00:07:45,974
until I was
about twelve years old...

103
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,272
and that no-talent
ass clown became famous...

104
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,475
and started winning Grammys.

105
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,649
Hmm.

106
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:54,735
Well, why don't you just go
by Mike instead of Michael?

107
00:07:54,825 --> 00:07:56,983
Why should I change?
He's the one who sucks.

108
00:07:57,328 --> 00:07:58,407
Hey, guys.

109
00:07:58,496 --> 00:08:00,073
What's up, G?

110
00:08:00,164 --> 00:08:02,073
Wanna go to Chotchkie's,
get some coffee?

111
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,660
Oh, it's a little early.

112
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:06,123
I gotta get outta here.
I think I'm gonna lose it.

113
00:08:06,212 --> 00:08:07,291
PEGG Uh-oh.

114
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,214
Sounds like somebody's
got a case of the Mondays.

115
00:08:15,096 --> 00:08:17,254
Boy, I tell ya, some days.

116
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:19,340
One of these days,
it's just gonna be like...

117
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:23,343
Heh heh heh!

118
00:08:23,438 --> 00:08:25,347
So, can I get you gentlemen
something more to drink...

119
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,519
or maybe something
to nibble on...

120
00:08:26,608 --> 00:08:29,099
some pizza shooters, shrimp
poppers, or extreme fajitas?

121
00:08:29,861 --> 00:08:31,141
- Just coffee.
- OK!

122
00:08:31,237 --> 00:08:33,064
Sounds like a case
of the Mondays.

123
00:08:37,994 --> 00:08:41,909
What if we're still doin' this
when we're fifty?

124
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:44,667
It would be nice to have
that kind of job security.

125
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:46,913
Lumbergh's gonna have me work
on Saturday.

126
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:48,912
I can tell already.

127
00:08:49,005 --> 00:08:51,082
I'm gonna end up doin' it,
because, uh...

128
00:08:51,175 --> 00:08:52,966
because I'm a big pussy...

129
00:08:53,051 --> 00:08:55,091
which is why I work
at Initech to begin with.

130
00:08:55,178 --> 00:08:56,804
Uh, yeah, well,
I work at Initech...

131
00:08:56,889 --> 00:08:58,927
and I don't consider myself
a pussy, OK?

132
00:08:59,015 --> 00:09:01,341
Yes. I am also not a pussy.

133
00:09:01,435 --> 00:09:03,558
They're gonna find out
the hard way I'm not a pussy...

134
00:09:03,645 --> 00:09:05,269
if they don't start treating
their software people better.

135
00:09:05,355 --> 00:09:06,898
That's right.

136
00:09:06,982 --> 00:09:08,559
They don't understand.

137
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,727
I could program a virus that'd
rip that place off big time.

138
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,362
Yeah.

139
00:09:12,446 --> 00:09:13,608
Big time.

140
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:16,564
Whoa!

141
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:17,822
There she is.

142
00:09:18,911 --> 00:09:21,485
Peter, you know,
you always talk about this girl.

143
00:09:22,332 --> 00:09:24,573
If you're so obsessed with her,
why don't you just ask her out?

144
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:25,830
Oh, I can't do that.

145
00:09:26,794 --> 00:09:28,075
I'm just another
asshole customer.

146
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,709
You can't just walk up
to a waitress and ask her out.

147
00:09:30,798 --> 00:09:32,839
Besides, I'm still trying
to work it out with Anne.

148
00:09:33,675 --> 00:09:36,594
Oh, that reminds me.
I can't play poker on Friday.

149
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,007
Why not?

150
00:09:38,097 --> 00:09:42,095
I'm gonna see this occupational
hypnotherapist with Anne.

151
00:09:42,185 --> 00:09:44,510
Dude,
an occupational hypnotherapist?

152
00:09:44,604 --> 00:09:46,977
I know. Anne wants me to go.

153
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:48,345
She thinks it might help.

154
00:09:49,192 --> 00:09:51,019
Um...

155
00:09:51,111 --> 00:09:53,483
You know,
sometimes I think that...

156
00:09:53,572 --> 00:09:56,063
I get thinking
that she's cheating on me.

157
00:09:56,158 --> 00:09:57,569
Yeah. I know what you mean.

158
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,153
Yeah.

159
00:10:00,371 --> 00:10:01,534
What is that supposed to mean?

160
00:10:02,872 --> 00:10:04,035
Nothing.

161
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,243
Why don't you just tell Anne
that you're not into hypnosis...

162
00:10:07,336 --> 00:10:08,415
and you wanna play poker
with us?

163
00:10:08,504 --> 00:10:10,081
I can't do that.
She'll get all pissed off...

164
00:10:10,172 --> 00:10:14,502
and, besides, I think the guy
might actually be able to help.

165
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:16,171
I mean,
he did help Anne lose weight.

166
00:10:17,054 --> 00:10:18,429
Peter, she's anorexic.

167
00:10:18,513 --> 00:10:20,257
Yeah, I know.

168
00:10:20,349 --> 00:10:21,678
The guy's really good.

169
00:10:22,851 --> 00:10:25,343
Yeah, well, I don't think any
occupational hypnotherapist...

170
00:10:25,438 --> 00:10:27,098
is gonna help you solve
any of your problems.

171
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,933
Hey, and speaking of problems...

172
00:10:29,025 --> 00:10:30,483
what's this I hear about you
having problems...

173
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:31,766
with your T.P.S. Reports?

174
00:10:31,861 --> 00:10:34,233
Yeah. Didn't you get that memo?

175
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:38,448
Hey! Hey, guys! Peter!

176
00:10:38,534 --> 00:10:40,159
Is that Smykowski?

177
00:10:40,996 --> 00:10:42,158
- Samir!
- What's he doing?

178
00:10:42,246 --> 00:10:43,906
Oh, probably workin' on
another heart attack.

179
00:10:43,998 --> 00:10:45,742
I've been lookin'
all over for you guys!

180
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,585
Have you seen this?
I knew it. I knew it.

181
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,295
What?
It's a staff meeting. So what?

182
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,917
So what?
We're all screwed. That's what.

183
00:10:53,007 --> 00:10:54,632
They're gonna downsize Initech.

184
00:10:54,718 --> 00:10:56,924
What are you talking
about? How do you know that?

185
00:10:57,011 --> 00:10:59,253
How do I know? They're
bringing in a consultant.

186
00:10:59,347 --> 00:11:00,427
That's how I know.

187
00:11:00,515 --> 00:11:02,223
That's what this staff meeting's
all about.

188
00:11:02,308 --> 00:11:04,100
It happened
at Initrode last year.

189
00:11:04,186 --> 00:11:05,929
You have to interview
with this consultant.

190
00:11:06,021 --> 00:11:07,764
They call them
efficiency experts...

191
00:11:07,856 --> 00:11:08,971
but what you're really doing...

192
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:10,441
is interviewing
for your own job.

193
00:11:10,526 --> 00:11:11,806
Every week you say
you're gonna lose your job...

194
00:11:11,902 --> 00:11:13,064
and you're still here.

195
00:11:13,153 --> 00:11:15,526
Not this time. I bet
I'm the first one laid off.

196
00:11:15,614 --> 00:11:17,737
The thought of having to go to
the state unemployment office...

197
00:11:17,825 --> 00:11:19,864
and stand in line
with those scumbags...

198
00:11:19,952 --> 00:11:21,327
Shit.

199
00:11:22,663 --> 00:11:24,323
You know there are people
in this world...

200
00:11:24,415 --> 00:11:26,821
that don't have to put up
with all this shit?

201
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,076
Like that guy
that invented the pet rock.

202
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,328
You see,
that's what you have to do.

203
00:11:33,173 --> 00:11:35,250
You have to use your mind...

204
00:11:35,343 --> 00:11:37,418
and come up with some really
great idea like that...

205
00:11:37,511 --> 00:11:39,801
and you can make millions...
Never have to work again.

206
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:42,011
You think the pet rock
was a really great idea?

207
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:43,926
Sure it was.

208
00:11:44,018 --> 00:11:46,141
The guy made a million dollars.

209
00:11:48,731 --> 00:11:51,483
You know, I had an idea
like that once...

210
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:53,026
a long time ago.

211
00:11:54,195 --> 00:11:55,654
Really? What was it, Tom?

212
00:11:56,363 --> 00:11:58,238
Well, all right.

213
00:11:58,324 --> 00:12:02,322
It was
a "Jump to Conclusions" mat.

214
00:12:03,913 --> 00:12:06,202
You see, it would be this mat...

215
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,449
that you would
put on the floor...

216
00:12:08,543 --> 00:12:12,755
and it would have different
conclusions written on it...

217
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:15,129
that you could jump to.

218
00:12:20,181 --> 00:12:22,421
That is the worst idea
I've ever heard in my life, Tom.

219
00:12:22,515 --> 00:12:26,216
Yes. Yes, it's horrible,
this idea.

220
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:30,266
Uh, look...

221
00:12:30,357 --> 00:12:31,685
I gotta get outta here.

222
00:12:32,526 --> 00:12:33,522
I'll see you guys later...

223
00:12:33,611 --> 00:12:35,520
if I still have a job.

224
00:12:36,363 --> 00:12:37,442
Yeah.

225
00:12:37,531 --> 00:12:39,323
Our high school
guidance counsellor...

226
00:12:39,408 --> 00:12:41,733
used to ask us what you would do
if you had a million dollars...

227
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:42,907
didn't have to work...

228
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:46,198
and whatever you'd say
was supposed to be your career.

229
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,749
So if you wanted
to fix old cars...

230
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,578
then you're supposed
to be an auto mechanic.

231
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:50,747
So what did you say?

232
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,710
I never had an answer.

233
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:55,416
I guess that's why
I'm working at Initech.

234
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:56,967
No. You're working at Initech...

235
00:12:57,051 --> 00:12:59,127
'cause that question
is bullshit to begin with.

236
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,844
If everyone listened to her,
there'd be no janitors...

237
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,256
because no one would clean shit
if they had a million dollars.

238
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,721
You know what I would do
if I had a million dollars?

239
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:08,930
I would invest half of it
in glorious mutual funds...

240
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:11,430
and then take the other half
to my friend Asadulah...

241
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:12,603
who works in securities...

242
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,815
Samir. Samir,
you're missing the point.

243
00:13:14,902 --> 00:13:16,480
The point of the exercise is
you're supposed to figure out...

244
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:19,027
what you would want to do if...

245
00:13:20,157 --> 00:13:23,029
"PC load letter"?
What the fuck does that mean?

246
00:13:45,184 --> 00:13:47,971
Hey, Peter, man!
Check out channel nine!

247
00:13:48,062 --> 00:13:49,259
Check out this chick!

248
00:13:49,354 --> 00:13:51,762
Damn it! Lawrence,
can't you just pretend...

249
00:13:51,857 --> 00:13:53,814
like we can't hear
each other through the wall?

250
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:56,143
Oh, sorry, man!
Anne over there or somethin'?

251
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:57,399
No, but...

252
00:13:58,364 --> 00:14:00,937
If you want to talk to me,
just come over.

253
00:14:04,328 --> 00:14:07,365
Hey, man, check this out, dude.

254
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,200
The key is early detection.

255
00:14:12,295 --> 00:14:13,375
Tumours that are detected...

256
00:14:13,463 --> 00:14:15,419
Aw, jeez, Lawrence.

257
00:14:15,506 --> 00:14:17,250
Sorry, man. I thought
you'd want to see this.

258
00:14:18,385 --> 00:14:19,760
Doesn't that chick
look like Anne?

259
00:14:19,844 --> 00:14:21,422
Yeah.

260
00:14:21,513 --> 00:14:22,710
A little bit. I...

261
00:14:22,805 --> 00:14:24,596
Hey, she hasn't been over here
in a while.

262
00:14:24,682 --> 00:14:26,058
You two still goin' out?

263
00:14:26,142 --> 00:14:27,767
Yeah.

264
00:14:27,853 --> 00:14:29,346
I guess. L... I don't know.

265
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:31,726
Sometimes I get the feeling
like she's cheating on me.

266
00:14:31,815 --> 00:14:33,973
Yeah. I get that feeling,
too, man.

267
00:14:35,444 --> 00:14:36,902
What do you mean by that?

268
00:14:36,986 --> 00:14:38,528
I don't know, man.

269
00:14:39,322 --> 00:14:41,565
I just get that feeling
lookin' at her, like...

270
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:43,983
she's the type of chick
that just...

271
00:14:44,994 --> 00:14:46,157
Uhh.

272
00:14:49,082 --> 00:14:51,241
Oh, I'm sorry, man. Look, l... l...

273
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:53,374
You know,
I'm talkin' outta my ass.

274
00:14:53,461 --> 00:14:54,790
Forget it. Don't worry.
It's all right.

275
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,589
Just... I had a rough day.

276
00:14:56,674 --> 00:14:58,297
Tell me about it, man.

277
00:14:58,383 --> 00:14:59,842
Ohh...

278
00:15:00,928 --> 00:15:02,672
Ooh, I gotta wake my ass up...

279
00:15:02,764 --> 00:15:05,764
at six a. m.
Every day this week...

280
00:15:05,849 --> 00:15:07,973
drag up to Las Golindas.

281
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,848
I'm doin' the drywall up there
at the new McDonald's.

282
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,643
Let me ask you something.

283
00:15:13,982 --> 00:15:16,225
When you come in on Monday, and
you're not feelin' real well...

284
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:17,434
does anyone ever say to you...

285
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:20,019
"Sounds like someone
has a case of the Mondays"?

286
00:15:21,658 --> 00:15:22,821
No.

287
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:25,071
No, man.

288
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,746
Shit, no, man.

289
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,404
You'd get your ass kicked,
sayin' something like that, man.

290
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,078
Huh.

291
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:33,578
We still goin' fishin'
this weekend?

292
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:35,746
Ah, Lumbergh's gonna have me
come in on Saturday.

293
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:36,918
I just know it.

294
00:15:37,007 --> 00:15:38,417
Well, you can
get out of that easily.

295
00:15:38,508 --> 00:15:40,547
Yeah? How?

296
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:41,798
Well...

297
00:15:42,512 --> 00:15:44,256
when a boss wants you
to work on Saturday...

298
00:15:44,347 --> 00:15:47,301
he generally asks you
at the end of the day, right?

299
00:15:47,392 --> 00:15:48,471
Yeah.

300
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,553
So all you gotta do is
avoid him... that's all right...

301
00:15:50,646 --> 00:15:52,852
I got it... on the last few hours
on Friday...

302
00:15:52,939 --> 00:15:54,766
duck out early...

303
00:15:54,858 --> 00:15:56,436
turn off
your answering machine...

304
00:15:56,527 --> 00:15:58,186
you should be home free, man.

305
00:16:00,655 --> 00:16:02,315
That's a really good idea.

306
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,363
Fuckin' "A," man.

307
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,953
Lawrence, what would you do
if you had a million dollars?

308
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,950
I'll tell you what I'd do, man.

309
00:16:13,127 --> 00:16:15,285
Two chicks
at the same time, man.

310
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:21,212
That's it?

311
00:16:21,303 --> 00:16:22,464
If you had a million dollars...

312
00:16:22,552 --> 00:16:24,593
you'd do two chicks
at the same time?

313
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,432
Damn straight. I've always
wanted to do that, man.

314
00:16:27,516 --> 00:16:30,268
I think if I were a millionaire,
I could hook that up, too...

315
00:16:30,353 --> 00:16:32,096
'cause chicks dig dudes
with money.

316
00:16:32,187 --> 00:16:33,563
Well, not all chicks.

317
00:16:33,648 --> 00:16:36,400
The type of chicks that would
double up on a dude like me do.

318
00:16:36,484 --> 00:16:37,598
Good point.

319
00:16:37,693 --> 00:16:39,603
What about you, now?
What would you do?

320
00:16:39,696 --> 00:16:41,072
Besides two chicks
at the same time?

321
00:16:41,156 --> 00:16:42,318
Well, yeah.

322
00:16:42,407 --> 00:16:43,949
Nothing.

323
00:16:44,951 --> 00:16:46,031
Nothin', huh?

324
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:48,277
I would relax.

325
00:16:48,371 --> 00:16:50,529
I would sit on my ass all day.

326
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,786
I would do nothing.

327
00:16:53,877 --> 00:16:56,450
You don't need a million dollars
to do nothin', man.

328
00:16:56,546 --> 00:16:58,004
Take a look at my cousin.

329
00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:00,166
He's broke, don't do shit.

330
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:05,967
Corporate accounts
payable. Nina speaking.

331
00:17:06,056 --> 00:17:07,466
Just a moment.

332
00:17:07,557 --> 00:17:09,966
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

333
00:17:10,061 --> 00:17:11,933
Just a moment.

334
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,262
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

335
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:15,934
Just a moment.

336
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,602
So, you should ask yourself...

337
00:17:18,693 --> 00:17:21,231
with every decision you make...

338
00:17:21,321 --> 00:17:23,445
"Is this good for the company?

339
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:25,157
"Am I helping with..."

340
00:17:25,242 --> 00:17:26,736
Is that the guy?

341
00:17:26,827 --> 00:17:28,950
Yeah. We're screwed.

342
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:31,659
OK, then, um...

343
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:35,163
I'd like to go ahead
and welcome, uh...

344
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:37,578
a new member to our team here.

345
00:17:37,672 --> 00:17:39,001
This is, uh...

346
00:17:40,174 --> 00:17:41,584
Bob Slydell.

347
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:45,129
Yeah. Uh...

348
00:17:45,222 --> 00:17:47,628
Bob is a consultant.

349
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,305
Yeah. He's gonna be
sort of, uh...

350
00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:53,933
helping us out...

351
00:17:54,021 --> 00:17:55,433
a little here...

352
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:56,934
asking some questions...

353
00:17:57,025 --> 00:17:58,484
maybe seeing
if there are some ways...

354
00:17:58,568 --> 00:18:01,272
we can make things run
a little more smoothly...

355
00:18:01,362 --> 00:18:02,525
around here.

356
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,359
Yeah.

357
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,738
Oh, and remember, next Friday...

358
00:18:07,827 --> 00:18:10,153
is Hawaiian shirt day.

359
00:18:11,998 --> 00:18:15,746
So, you know, if you want to,
go ahead and, uh...

360
00:18:15,835 --> 00:18:17,413
wear a Hawaiian shirt and jeans.

361
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,299
And I said I don't care
if they lay me off, either.

362
00:18:21,382 --> 00:18:22,581
Because I told Bill...

363
00:18:22,676 --> 00:18:25,084
that if they move my desk
one more time...

364
00:18:25,178 --> 00:18:27,931
then I'm... I'm quitting.
I'm going to quit...

365
00:18:28,015 --> 00:18:29,474
and I told Dom, too...

366
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:32,761
because they've moved my desk
four times already this year...

367
00:18:32,853 --> 00:18:35,011
and I used to be over
by the window...

368
00:18:35,105 --> 00:18:38,309
and I could see the squirrels,
and they were married...

369
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:40,607
but then they switched
from the Swingline...

370
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:43,102
to the Boston stapler, but
I kept my Swingline stapler...

371
00:18:43,197 --> 00:18:45,106
because it didn't
bind up as much...

372
00:18:45,198 --> 00:18:47,737
and I kept the staples
for the Swingline stapler.

373
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:48,907
OK, Milton.

374
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:51,070
No, it's not OK,
because if they make me...

375
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:54,580
If they take my stapler,
then I'll... I'll... I'll...

376
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,908
I'll set the building on fire.

377
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,245
OK, well, that sounds great.

378
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,082
Uh, I'll talk to you later,
all right? Bye.

379
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:02,337
Peter...

380
00:19:18,316 --> 00:19:19,514
Good-bye.

381
00:19:41,966 --> 00:19:43,341
Come on.

382
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,469
Oh, for cryin'...

383
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:11,699
Hello, Peter. What's happening?

384
00:20:11,788 --> 00:20:13,413
Um...

385
00:20:13,498 --> 00:20:15,407
I'm gonna need you...

386
00:20:15,499 --> 00:20:17,327
to go ahead
and come in tomorrow...

387
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:21,546
so if you could be here
around...

388
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,086
nine, that would be great.

389
00:20:24,175 --> 00:20:25,373
OK?

390
00:20:27,137 --> 00:20:29,093
Oh, oh, and I almost forgot.

391
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,924
Um...

392
00:20:31,016 --> 00:20:33,767
I'm also gonna need you
to go ahead and come in...

393
00:20:33,852 --> 00:20:36,390
on Sunday, too, OK?

394
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,105
We, um...

395
00:20:38,189 --> 00:20:39,933
Iost some people this week...

396
00:20:40,025 --> 00:20:42,101
and, uh...

397
00:20:42,194 --> 00:20:44,186
we need to sort of play
catch-up.

398
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,524
Thanks.

399
00:20:49,534 --> 00:20:51,077
So I was sitting
in my cubicle today...

400
00:20:51,161 --> 00:20:55,159
and I realised, ever since
I started working, um...

401
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,914
every single day of my life
has been worse than...

402
00:20:59,002 --> 00:21:00,711
the day before it.

403
00:21:01,673 --> 00:21:05,373
So that means that every single
day that you see me...

404
00:21:06,344 --> 00:21:08,217
that's on the worst day
of my life.

405
00:21:08,971 --> 00:21:10,430
What about today?

406
00:21:10,514 --> 00:21:11,759
Is today
the worst day of your life?

407
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:14,471
- Yeah.
- Wow. That's messed up.

408
00:21:17,355 --> 00:21:18,848
I'm sorry.

409
00:21:18,939 --> 00:21:20,138
Go on.

410
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:23,768
Is there any way
that you could sort of...

411
00:21:23,862 --> 00:21:26,613
just zonk me out so that, like,
I don't know...

412
00:21:26,698 --> 00:21:29,105
that I'm at work... in here?

413
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,612
Could I come home...

414
00:21:30,702 --> 00:21:34,117
and think that I've been fishing
all day or something?

415
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:36,911
That's... really not what I do,
Peter.

416
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:38,245
Heh.

417
00:21:38,334 --> 00:21:39,497
However...

418
00:21:40,503 --> 00:21:43,041
the good news is,
I think I can help you.

419
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:46,165
I want you to do something
for me, Peter.

420
00:21:47,844 --> 00:21:50,051
I want you to try and relax.

421
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,602
I want you to relax
every muscle in your body...

422
00:21:56,687 --> 00:22:01,016
beginning with your toes
to your fingertips.

423
00:22:03,777 --> 00:22:05,936
Now I want you
to relax your legs.

424
00:22:07,322 --> 00:22:09,944
You're beginning to feel
your eyelids getting heavy...

425
00:22:11,077 --> 00:22:13,283
as you slip deeper and deeper...

426
00:22:13,371 --> 00:22:16,621
into a state
of complete relaxation.

427
00:22:16,707 --> 00:22:20,871
All your cares and concerns
are disappearing.

428
00:22:20,961 --> 00:22:22,455
Deeper and deeper.

429
00:22:22,546 --> 00:22:24,456
Way down.

430
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:26,755
Your concern about your job...

431
00:22:27,552 --> 00:22:29,758
melts away...

432
00:22:29,846 --> 00:22:31,754
way...

433
00:22:31,847 --> 00:22:33,259
way down.

434
00:22:33,349 --> 00:22:34,677
Unh.

435
00:22:37,311 --> 00:22:39,186
Now, when I count backwards
from three...

436
00:22:39,898 --> 00:22:42,649
you'll be in a state
of complete relaxation.

437
00:22:42,733 --> 00:22:45,688
Your worries, cares,
and inhibitions will be gone...

438
00:22:46,529 --> 00:22:48,404
and you will remain
in that state...

439
00:22:49,616 --> 00:22:51,904
until I snap my fingers.

440
00:22:51,993 --> 00:22:53,452
Three.

441
00:22:53,537 --> 00:22:55,197
Deeper and deeper.

442
00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:56,912
Way...

443
00:22:56,998 --> 00:22:58,457
way down.

444
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:00,535
Two.

445
00:23:00,628 --> 00:23:02,620
Deeper and deeper...

446
00:23:02,713 --> 00:23:05,548
W-w-w-way down...

447
00:23:07,593 --> 00:23:09,965
Whu... whu...

448
00:23:10,053 --> 00:23:11,251
One.

449
00:23:12,431 --> 00:23:15,183
Oh, my God!
Dr. Swanson!

450
00:23:16,226 --> 00:23:17,934
Ew... ew...

451
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,265
- Is he breathing?
- Call 911!

452
00:23:19,355 --> 00:23:23,104
Oh! Where's the phone?
Where's the goddamn phone?

453
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,671
Ahh...

454
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,308
Yeah, hi, it's Bill Lumbergh.

455
00:24:00,396 --> 00:24:01,594
It's about...

456
00:24:01,689 --> 00:24:03,433
ten o'clock.

457
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,936
Yeah. Just, uh...

458
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,401
wondering where you are.

459
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:12,115
Yeah. Hi.
It's Bill Lumbergh again.

460
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,114
Uh...

461
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,779
I just wanted
to make sure you knew...

462
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,325
that we did start
at the, uh...

463
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,787
usual time this morning.

464
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:23,078
Yeah. It isn't a half day
or anything like that...

465
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,127
so if you could just go ahead...

466
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,206
and get here
as soon as possible...

467
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,173
that would be terrific.

468
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,803
Ahh...

469
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:50,902
Yeah. Hi. It's Bill Lum...

470
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,241
Yeah. It's...
Yeah. Hi. It's Bill Lumber...

471
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:56,118
Yeah. It's me again.

472
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:59,039
Uh, I was away from my desk
for a minute.

473
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:02,291
Just checking in.

474
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:04,581
Hello?

475
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,331
Peter, what's going on?

476
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:07,586
Huh?

477
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:10,081
It's three-thirty.
Why aren't you at work?

478
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:13,089
Because l... l...

479
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,590
I didn't feel like it.

480
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:16,759
Peter, what's gotten into you?

481
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,843
First, you just sit there
while Dr. Swanson dies...

482
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:21,771
then you walk out and embarrass
me in front of my friends...

483
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:23,515
and don't blame this
on hypnosis, either.

484
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:25,398
That's total bull...

485
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:33,572
Listen, asshole.
Nobody hangs up on me.

486
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,117
We're through.

487
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:37,112
Oh, and one more thing...

488
00:25:37,205 --> 00:25:39,279
I've been cheating on you!

489
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,172
So, from now on,
only use the new time sheets...

490
00:25:47,256 --> 00:25:51,752
if you've worked on two or more
job codes in one day...

491
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:54,798
and you need the extra columns
to fit it all in.

492
00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:56,169
Otherwise,
use the old time sheets...

493
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:57,760
Where's Peter?

494
00:25:57,851 --> 00:25:59,260
I heard he didn't show up
this weekend.

495
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:00,431
Uh, I don't know.

496
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:02,014
...really, really help us out.

497
00:26:02,105 --> 00:26:03,598
Who's that guy?

498
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:07,355
So, uh... any questions?

499
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:22,410
Hi. I'm Peter.

500
00:26:22,501 --> 00:26:23,579
Hi. Can I help you?

501
00:26:23,668 --> 00:26:24,783
What are you doin'
for lunch today?

502
00:26:24,878 --> 00:26:28,412
Uh, well, our specials today
are blackened chicken.

503
00:26:28,506 --> 00:26:30,795
It's actually right there
on the board. Excuse me.

504
00:26:33,928 --> 00:26:35,257
Hey, look who's back!

505
00:26:35,347 --> 00:26:37,055
Table for three to...

506
00:26:39,893 --> 00:26:41,802
I was askin'
what you were doin' for lunch.

507
00:26:41,895 --> 00:26:43,519
Would you like to have lunch
with me?

508
00:26:45,107 --> 00:26:46,305
Are you... are you serious?

509
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,563
Yeah.

510
00:26:48,735 --> 00:26:51,856
Yeah. L... I don't think
I'm supposed to do that.

511
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,862
Oh. OK, well,
I'll tell you what I'll do.

512
00:26:54,951 --> 00:26:56,361
I'm gonna go next door
and get a table...

513
00:26:56,452 --> 00:26:58,111
and if you'd like
to join me, uh...

514
00:26:58,203 --> 00:26:59,449
no big deal, all right?

515
00:26:59,538 --> 00:27:01,413
And if not, that's cool, too.

516
00:27:01,499 --> 00:27:02,696
- OK?
- OK.

517
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:03,906
All right.

518
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:05,998
When you say,
"next door..."

519
00:27:06,087 --> 00:27:08,578
do you mean
Chili's or Flinger's?

520
00:27:08,673 --> 00:27:10,297
Flinger's.

521
00:27:10,382 --> 00:27:11,546
OK.

522
00:27:12,843 --> 00:27:15,050
What you do at Initech...

523
00:27:15,138 --> 00:27:17,924
is you take the specifications
from the customers...

524
00:27:18,015 --> 00:27:20,423
and you bring them down
to the software engineers?

525
00:27:20,518 --> 00:27:22,760
Yes. Y-yes.
That's... that's right.

526
00:27:22,854 --> 00:27:24,478
Well, then I just have to ask...

527
00:27:24,564 --> 00:27:25,762
why couldn't the customers...

528
00:27:25,857 --> 00:27:29,392
just take them directly
to the software people, huh?

529
00:27:29,486 --> 00:27:31,525
Well, I'll tell you why.

530
00:27:32,864 --> 00:27:34,442
Uh, because...

531
00:27:34,533 --> 00:27:37,782
engineers are not good
at dealing with customers.

532
00:27:37,868 --> 00:27:39,529
Uh-huh. So...

533
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:45,200
you physically take the specs
from the customer?

534
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:47,367
Well...

535
00:27:48,797 --> 00:27:51,916
no. My secretary does that
or the fax.

536
00:27:52,008 --> 00:27:53,716
Huh.

537
00:27:53,802 --> 00:27:55,510
So then you must
physically bring them...

538
00:27:55,596 --> 00:27:56,627
to the software people.

539
00:27:56,722 --> 00:27:57,837
Well...

540
00:27:59,224 --> 00:28:00,304
no.

541
00:28:00,392 --> 00:28:01,637
I mean...

542
00:28:01,726 --> 00:28:03,269
sometimes.

543
00:28:03,354 --> 00:28:07,600
What... what would you
say you do here?

544
00:28:08,692 --> 00:28:10,769
Well, look,
I already told you.

545
00:28:10,862 --> 00:28:13,103
I deal with
the goddamn customers...

546
00:28:13,196 --> 00:28:14,988
so the engineers don't have to.

547
00:28:15,074 --> 00:28:17,113
I have people skills.

548
00:28:17,201 --> 00:28:19,159
I am good at dealing
with people!

549
00:28:19,245 --> 00:28:20,620
Can't you understand that?

550
00:28:20,705 --> 00:28:23,112
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

551
00:28:23,207 --> 00:28:24,406
L...

552
00:28:31,048 --> 00:28:32,128
Let's see...

553
00:28:32,216 --> 00:28:34,423
you are...

554
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,791
Michael...

555
00:28:37,221 --> 00:28:39,927
- Bolton?
- Yeah.

556
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,513
Is that your real name?

557
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:44,432
Yeah.

558
00:28:46,481 --> 00:28:48,520
Are you any relation
to the pop singer?

559
00:28:48,608 --> 00:28:50,601
No, it's... it's
just a coincidence.

560
00:28:50,694 --> 00:28:52,236
Ha ha.
To be honest with you...

561
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,945
I love his music. I do.

562
00:28:54,031 --> 00:28:56,153
- I'm a Michael Bolton fan.
- Me, too.

563
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,901
For my money, I don't
know if it gets any better...

564
00:28:57,993 --> 00:29:00,449
than when he sings
"When a Man Loves a Woman."

565
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:02,446
But you must really
love his music, huh?

566
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:06,656
Yeah, he's... he's...

567
00:29:06,752 --> 00:29:08,412
he's pretty...
He's pretty good, I guess.

568
00:29:08,504 --> 00:29:10,081
You're goddamn right, he is.

569
00:29:10,172 --> 00:29:12,628
Right.

570
00:29:12,716 --> 00:29:15,173
So tell me, what's
your favourite song of his?

571
00:29:16,094 --> 00:29:17,505
Mmm...

572
00:29:20,266 --> 00:29:22,259
I don't... I don't know.
Heh heh.

573
00:29:22,351 --> 00:29:24,677
I mean, I guess I sort
of like them all.

574
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:27,890
That's a riot.
I'm the exact same way.

575
00:29:27,982 --> 00:29:29,228
But it must be twice
as hard for you...

576
00:29:29,317 --> 00:29:30,727
being you have
the same name as him.

577
00:29:30,817 --> 00:29:33,689
I celebrate
the guy's entire catalogue.

578
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,271
Anyway, let's get down
to business, Michael.

579
00:29:36,366 --> 00:29:38,524
You know,
you can just call me Mike.

580
00:29:43,998 --> 00:29:45,077
Hi.

581
00:29:45,165 --> 00:29:46,446
Hey.

582
00:29:48,378 --> 00:29:51,248
I wonder if I'm allowed
to, uh, wear this in here?

583
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:53,418
I think it would be OK.

584
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,172
Would you like to sit down?

585
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,506
OK.

586
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,842
Ahh.

587
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:02,429
Wow!

588
00:30:02,517 --> 00:30:05,268
This place is really... nice.

589
00:30:05,353 --> 00:30:07,642
Yeah. Is it?

590
00:30:07,731 --> 00:30:09,937
Yeah, my God,
compared to Chotchkie's!

591
00:30:10,025 --> 00:30:12,350
I like the uniforms better,
anyways.

592
00:30:13,195 --> 00:30:14,274
I like yours.

593
00:30:14,363 --> 00:30:15,525
Ugh!

594
00:30:18,785 --> 00:30:20,361
"We're not in Kansas anymore."

595
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:22,492
Yeah.

596
00:30:22,579 --> 00:30:24,952
Really. Ha ha.

597
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,451
It's on your...

598
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:29,951
Ohh! Yeah. That's...

599
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:31,919
That's, uh...

600
00:30:32,006 --> 00:30:34,959
That's one of my...
My pieces of flair.

601
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,129
What's a "piece of flair"?

602
00:30:36,218 --> 00:30:38,212
Oh, it's, uh, where, you know...

603
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:41,838
like these suspenders and, uh,
buttons, they're all sort of...

604
00:30:41,932 --> 00:30:43,973
We're actually required
to wear...

605
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:47,014
um, fifteen pieces of flair.

606
00:30:47,105 --> 00:30:49,262
It's really stupid, actually.

607
00:30:49,356 --> 00:30:50,555
Do you get to pick 'em
yourself?

608
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,109
Yeah, yeah, we do.

609
00:30:52,193 --> 00:30:53,308
Although I didn't actually
choose these.

610
00:30:53,403 --> 00:30:57,697
I just sort of grabbed,
you know, fifteen buttons.

611
00:30:57,782 --> 00:31:00,534
I don't even know what they say.
I don't really care.

612
00:31:01,203 --> 00:31:02,827
I don't really like
talking about my flair.

613
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,287
OK.

614
00:31:04,372 --> 00:31:07,374
So, where do you, work, Peter?

615
00:31:07,459 --> 00:31:08,952
Initech.

616
00:31:09,043 --> 00:31:10,835
And... Yeah?
What... what do you do there?

617
00:31:11,922 --> 00:31:13,582
I sit in a cubicle...

618
00:31:13,673 --> 00:31:16,674
and I update bank software
for the 2000 switch.

619
00:31:18,095 --> 00:31:19,209
What's that?

620
00:31:19,304 --> 00:31:21,428
Well, see, they wrote
all this bank software...

621
00:31:21,515 --> 00:31:23,424
and, uh, to save space...

622
00:31:23,516 --> 00:31:25,260
they used two digits
for the date instead of four.

623
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:28,270
So like 98 instead of 1998.

624
00:31:28,356 --> 00:31:31,558
Uh, so I go through these
thousands of lines of code...

625
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:34,437
and, uh...
It doesn't really matter.

626
00:31:34,528 --> 00:31:37,399
I, uh, I don't like my job,
and, uh...

627
00:31:37,489 --> 00:31:39,778
I don't think I'm gonna go
anymore.

628
00:31:41,035 --> 00:31:42,280
You're just not gonna go?

629
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,531
Yeah.

630
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,783
Won't you get fired?

631
00:31:45,706 --> 00:31:46,904
I don't know.

632
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:50,783
But I really don't like it,
and, uh, I'm not gonna go.

633
00:31:51,962 --> 00:31:52,959
So you're gonna quit?

634
00:31:53,046 --> 00:31:56,214
Nah-uh. Not really. Uh...

635
00:31:56,301 --> 00:31:57,878
I'm just gonna stop going.

636
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:01,259
What?

637
00:32:01,347 --> 00:32:03,423
Uh, when did you decide
all that?

638
00:32:03,516 --> 00:32:04,596
About an hour ago.

639
00:32:04,683 --> 00:32:06,095
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

640
00:32:06,185 --> 00:32:07,348
An hour ago.

641
00:32:08,688 --> 00:32:10,230
So you're gonna get another job?

642
00:32:10,315 --> 00:32:12,438
I don't think I'd like
another job.

643
00:32:12,525 --> 00:32:16,358
Well, what are you going to do
about money and bills and...

644
00:32:16,446 --> 00:32:18,936
You know, I've never
really liked paying bills.

645
00:32:19,031 --> 00:32:20,526
I don't think
I'm gonna do that, either.

646
00:32:22,578 --> 00:32:23,692
Ahh...

647
00:32:23,787 --> 00:32:25,862
well, so what do you want to do?

648
00:32:25,955 --> 00:32:27,912
I want to take you
out to dinner...

649
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:30,288
and then I want to go back to my
apartment and watch "Kung Fu."

650
00:32:30,377 --> 00:32:31,706
Do you ever watch "Kung Fu"?

651
00:32:33,838 --> 00:32:35,499
I love "Kung Fu."

652
00:32:35,591 --> 00:32:37,832
- Channel 39.
- Totally.

653
00:32:37,926 --> 00:32:39,670
You should come over
and watch "Kung Fu" tonight.

654
00:32:39,762 --> 00:32:41,719
- OK.
- Great.

655
00:32:41,805 --> 00:32:43,928
OK. Can we order lunch first?

656
00:32:44,016 --> 00:32:45,558
- Yeah.
- OK.

657
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:03,322
Took a stapler off my desk...

658
00:33:09,917 --> 00:33:12,622
Anyway, sounds great, Bob.
See you in a few.

659
00:33:15,298 --> 00:33:17,753
Hi, Milton. What's happening?

660
00:33:17,842 --> 00:33:19,420
Nothing.

661
00:33:19,511 --> 00:33:21,421
I'm going to have
to ask you to go ahead...

662
00:33:21,513 --> 00:33:23,754
and move your desk
again, so...

663
00:33:23,848 --> 00:33:26,601
if you could go ahead
and get it as far back...

664
00:33:26,684 --> 00:33:28,512
against that wall as possible...

665
00:33:28,603 --> 00:33:29,848
that would be great.

666
00:33:29,938 --> 00:33:31,432
No, because I was...

667
00:33:31,523 --> 00:33:32,981
That way,
we'll have some room...

668
00:33:33,066 --> 00:33:34,858
for some of these boxes
and things...

669
00:33:34,943 --> 00:33:38,062
we need to put in here,
and, uh...

670
00:33:38,154 --> 00:33:41,570
Oh. Oh, there it is.

671
00:33:41,658 --> 00:33:44,327
Here, let me just go ahead
and get that from you.

672
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,777
Great.

673
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:52,207
So if you could just get to that
as soon as possible...

674
00:33:52,293 --> 00:33:54,999
that would be terrific, OK?

675
00:33:55,089 --> 00:33:57,757
Thanks a bunch, Milton.
Good-bye.

676
00:33:57,841 --> 00:34:00,167
OK.

677
00:34:01,178 --> 00:34:03,551
I could set the building
on fire.

678
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,843
- Peter.
- Michael.

679
00:34:08,936 --> 00:34:10,016
What the hell's going on, man?

680
00:34:10,105 --> 00:34:11,930
I thought you'd come in here
and start shooting.

681
00:34:12,022 --> 00:34:14,062
No. I just came to get
my address book.

682
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,265
I'm not gonna stay.

683
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,648
I got a phone number,
Mike, that I don't wanna lose.

684
00:34:17,737 --> 00:34:19,445
What?
Peter, you're in deep shit.

685
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,522
You were supposed to come in
Saturday. What were you doing?

686
00:34:22,408 --> 00:34:25,244
Michael, I did nothing.

687
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:26,786
I did absolutely nothing...

688
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:29,789
and it was everything
that I thought it could be.

689
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:32,447
I hope you have
a better story for Lumbergh.

690
00:34:32,543 --> 00:34:35,117
You're supposed to be at your
interview with the consultants.

691
00:34:35,213 --> 00:34:36,327
The who?

692
00:34:36,422 --> 00:34:38,712
The consultants.
What has gotten into you?

693
00:34:40,676 --> 00:34:43,963
Oh, yeah... right.

694
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:47,724
Wait, Peter.
You gotta postpone it, man.

695
00:34:47,809 --> 00:34:48,888
Tell 'em you've been sick.
Make something up.

696
00:34:48,977 --> 00:34:51,100
Oh, no way. No, I feel great.

697
00:34:51,187 --> 00:34:53,015
It's the best day of my life.

698
00:34:55,275 --> 00:34:57,600
Next batter
looks like a Peter Gibbons.

699
00:34:57,694 --> 00:34:58,809
Uh-huh.

700
00:34:58,904 --> 00:35:01,192
Ah, there you are.
We were just talking about you.

701
00:35:01,281 --> 00:35:02,906
You must be Peter Gibbons.

702
00:35:02,991 --> 00:35:04,320
Uh-huh. Terrific.

703
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,782
I'm Bob Slydell. This is
my associate Bob Porter.

704
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:08,281
Oh, hi, Bob. Bob.

705
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:10,909
Grab a seat
and join us for a minute or two.

706
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,168
You see, what we're
actually trying to do here...

707
00:35:14,254 --> 00:35:17,170
is we're just,
we're trying to get a feel...

708
00:35:17,256 --> 00:35:19,130
for how people spend their day
at work.

709
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:20,841
So if you would...

710
00:35:20,926 --> 00:35:24,510
would you walk us through
a typical day for you?

711
00:35:25,681 --> 00:35:27,924
- Yeah.
- Great.

712
00:35:28,017 --> 00:35:31,468
Well, I generally come in
at least fifteen minutes late.

713
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:33,970
Uh, I use the side door.

714
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:37,019
That way Lumbergh can't see me.

715
00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:41,024
And after that, I just sort of
space out for about an hour.

716
00:35:41,114 --> 00:35:43,605
Uh, "space out"?

717
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,778
Yeah.

718
00:35:44,867 --> 00:35:46,694
I just stare at my desk.

719
00:35:46,786 --> 00:35:48,245
But it looks like I'm working.

720
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:52,113
I do that for probably
another hour after lunch, too.

721
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:54,000
I'd say in a given week...

722
00:35:54,086 --> 00:35:55,912
I probably only do
about fifteen minutes...

723
00:35:56,004 --> 00:35:58,875
of real, actual work.

724
00:36:00,383 --> 00:36:03,587
Peter,
would you be a good sport...

725
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:05,635
and indulge us and just...

726
00:36:05,722 --> 00:36:06,753
tell us a little more?

727
00:36:06,848 --> 00:36:08,308
Oh, yeah.

728
00:36:08,392 --> 00:36:12,057
Let me tell you something
about T.P.S. Reports.

729
00:36:12,145 --> 00:36:13,260
Ahh...

730
00:36:13,355 --> 00:36:16,724
The thing is, Bob,
it's not that I'm lazy.

731
00:36:16,817 --> 00:36:18,774
It's that I just don't care.

732
00:36:18,861 --> 00:36:21,019
Don't... don't care?

733
00:36:21,113 --> 00:36:23,605
It's a problem of motivation,
all right?

734
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,276
Now, if I work my ass off...

735
00:36:25,367 --> 00:36:27,241
and Initech
ships a few extra units...

736
00:36:27,328 --> 00:36:29,119
I don't see another dime.

737
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:30,829
So where's the motivation?

738
00:36:31,582 --> 00:36:33,456
And here's something else,
Bob...

739
00:36:33,542 --> 00:36:35,451
I have eight different bosses
right now.

740
00:36:35,544 --> 00:36:36,624
- I beg your pardon?
- Eight bosses.

741
00:36:36,712 --> 00:36:37,792
- Eight?
- Eight, Bob.

742
00:36:37,881 --> 00:36:40,631
So that means that
when I make a mistake...

743
00:36:40,716 --> 00:36:44,251
I have eight different people
coming by to tell me about it.

744
00:36:44,345 --> 00:36:47,631
That's my only real motivation,
is not to be hassled.

745
00:36:47,724 --> 00:36:48,921
That and the fear
of losing my job.

746
00:36:49,016 --> 00:36:50,843
But you know, Bob...

747
00:36:50,935 --> 00:36:52,596
that'll only make someone
work just hard enough...

748
00:36:52,688 --> 00:36:53,849
not to get fired.

749
00:36:54,522 --> 00:36:57,440
Would you bear with me
for just a second, please?

750
00:36:57,526 --> 00:36:58,854
OK.

751
00:37:00,112 --> 00:37:01,855
What if...
And believe me...

752
00:37:01,946 --> 00:37:04,900
this is strictly hypothetical...

753
00:37:04,991 --> 00:37:08,988
but what if you were offered
some kind of a stock option...

754
00:37:09,078 --> 00:37:10,787
equity-sharing program?

755
00:37:10,872 --> 00:37:12,118
Would that do anything for you?

756
00:37:12,207 --> 00:37:14,413
I don't know. I guess.
Listen, I'm gonna go.

757
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,455
Uh, it's been really nice
talking to both of you guys.

758
00:37:17,546 --> 00:37:18,790
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

759
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,454
Pleasure's all on this
side of the table, trust me.

760
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,091
Good luck
with your layoffs, all right?

761
00:37:23,176 --> 00:37:24,920
I hope your firings
go really well.

762
00:37:25,012 --> 00:37:26,127
- OK.
- Thanks a lot.

763
00:37:26,222 --> 00:37:27,966
Great. Wow.

764
00:37:35,605 --> 00:37:37,931
So, Peter, what's happening?

765
00:37:38,024 --> 00:37:39,400
Listen, uh...

766
00:37:46,784 --> 00:37:49,109
Joanna, would you
come here a minute, please?

767
00:37:49,203 --> 00:37:51,077
Yeah.

768
00:37:51,163 --> 00:37:55,327
I'm sorry I was late, but I
was having lunch, and I, uh...

769
00:37:55,418 --> 00:37:57,042
We need to talk about
your flair.

770
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,791
Really?
L... I have fifteen pieces on.

771
00:38:00,882 --> 00:38:02,341
I also...

772
00:38:02,426 --> 00:38:05,545
Well, fifteen
is the minimum, OK?

773
00:38:05,637 --> 00:38:06,716
Oh. OK.

774
00:38:06,805 --> 00:38:08,714
Now, you know,
it's up to you whether or not...

775
00:38:08,807 --> 00:38:11,642
you want to just
do the bare minimum or...

776
00:38:11,726 --> 00:38:12,924
Well, like Brian, for example...

777
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:16,389
has thirty-seven pieces of flair
on today.

778
00:38:16,482 --> 00:38:17,761
And a terrific smile.

779
00:38:17,857 --> 00:38:20,183
OK, so you want me to wear more?

780
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,899
Look, Joanna...

781
00:38:22,988 --> 00:38:24,067
Yeah?

782
00:38:24,156 --> 00:38:25,982
People can get
a cheeseburger anywhere, OK?

783
00:38:26,074 --> 00:38:29,194
They come to Chotchkie's for
the atmosphere and the attitude.

784
00:38:29,995 --> 00:38:31,276
OK? That's what
the flair's about.

785
00:38:31,372 --> 00:38:33,031
- It's about fun.
- Yeah.

786
00:38:33,122 --> 00:38:35,282
OK, so more then, yeah?

787
00:38:37,043 --> 00:38:40,247
Look, we want you
to express yourself, OK?

788
00:38:40,339 --> 00:38:44,752
Now if you feel that the bare
minimum is enough, then, OK...

789
00:38:44,844 --> 00:38:47,595
but some people choose
to wear more...

790
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:49,553
and we encourage that, OK?

791
00:38:50,892 --> 00:38:52,883
You do want to express yourself,
don't you?

792
00:38:54,019 --> 00:38:55,099
Y-yeah.

793
00:38:55,187 --> 00:38:57,595
OK, great, great.
That's all I ask.

794
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:59,315
OK.

795
00:39:00,443 --> 00:39:03,147
Right, so there's
three more people...

796
00:39:03,237 --> 00:39:05,230
we can easily lose.

797
00:39:05,323 --> 00:39:08,526
Then there's Tom Smykowski.

798
00:39:09,452 --> 00:39:10,531
He's useless.

799
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,162
Gone.

800
00:39:12,246 --> 00:39:13,825
Sounds good to me.

801
00:39:13,915 --> 00:39:16,287
Here's a peculiar...

802
00:39:16,376 --> 00:39:18,618
- Uh, Milton Waddams.
- Who's he?

803
00:39:18,712 --> 00:39:20,705
You know, squirrelly
looking guy. Mumbles a lot.

804
00:39:20,798 --> 00:39:21,875
Oh, yeah.

805
00:39:21,964 --> 00:39:23,625
We... we can't actually
find a record...

806
00:39:23,716 --> 00:39:25,959
of him being
a current employee here.

807
00:39:26,053 --> 00:39:27,844
I looked into it
more deeply...

808
00:39:27,929 --> 00:39:29,838
and I found that
apparently what happened...

809
00:39:29,931 --> 00:39:32,636
is that he was laid off
five years ago...

810
00:39:32,726 --> 00:39:33,889
and no one ever
told him about it...

811
00:39:33,977 --> 00:39:36,432
but through some kind of glitch
in the payroll department...

812
00:39:36,521 --> 00:39:37,801
he still gets a paycheque.

813
00:39:37,897 --> 00:39:40,734
So we just went ahead
and fixed the glitch.

814
00:39:40,818 --> 00:39:41,897
Great.

815
00:39:41,985 --> 00:39:44,655
So, uh, Milton has been let go?

816
00:39:44,738 --> 00:39:45,818
Just a second there,
professor.

817
00:39:45,906 --> 00:39:49,440
We, uh, we fixed the glitch.

818
00:39:49,534 --> 00:39:51,657
So he won't be receiving
a paycheque anymore.

819
00:39:51,745 --> 00:39:54,201
So it'll just work itself out
naturally.

820
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:57,325
We always like to avoid
confrontation whenever possible.

821
00:39:57,417 --> 00:39:58,497
The problem is solved
from your end.

822
00:39:59,754 --> 00:40:03,204
I'd like to move us
right along to a Peter Gibbons.

823
00:40:03,298 --> 00:40:05,836
Now, we had a chance
to meet this young man...

824
00:40:05,926 --> 00:40:08,500
and, boy, that's just
a straight shooter...

825
00:40:08,596 --> 00:40:10,256
with upper management
written all over him.

826
00:40:10,348 --> 00:40:12,720
Eech. Ooh.

827
00:40:12,808 --> 00:40:16,094
Yeah. Um...

828
00:40:16,187 --> 00:40:17,431
I'm going to have to go ahead...

829
00:40:17,521 --> 00:40:19,645
and sort of disagree
with you there.

830
00:40:19,732 --> 00:40:22,270
Yeah, uh, he's been
real flaky lately...

831
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:26,108
and I'm just not sure
that he's the calibre person...

832
00:40:26,197 --> 00:40:28,439
that we would want
for upper management.

833
00:40:28,533 --> 00:40:31,202
He's also been having
some problems...

834
00:40:31,286 --> 00:40:33,195
with his T.P.S. Reports.

835
00:40:34,289 --> 00:40:36,162
I'll handle this.

836
00:40:36,249 --> 00:40:39,285
We feel...

837
00:40:39,377 --> 00:40:41,453
that the problem
isn't with Peter.

838
00:40:41,546 --> 00:40:43,290
Mm-mmm.

839
00:40:43,382 --> 00:40:45,457
It's that you haven't
challenged him enough...

840
00:40:45,549 --> 00:40:46,629
to get him really motivated.

841
00:40:46,718 --> 00:40:47,881
There it is.

842
00:40:49,304 --> 00:40:51,760
Yeah... Ah, well...

843
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,090
I'm just not sure about that
right now.

844
00:40:54,184 --> 00:40:56,889
Yeah, Bill, let me ask
you a real quick question here.

845
00:40:56,979 --> 00:41:00,263
How much time would you say
you spend each week...

846
00:41:00,356 --> 00:41:02,350
dealing with
these T.P.S. Reports?

847
00:41:07,572 --> 00:41:08,736
Yeah...

848
00:42:16,185 --> 00:42:17,383
Hey, Peter, man!

849
00:42:17,477 --> 00:42:21,013
Check out channel nine.
It's the breast exams. Whoo!

850
00:42:36,873 --> 00:42:38,117
Hi, Peter.

851
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,950
Oh, hi, Dom.

852
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,257
So... Peter...

853
00:43:30,344 --> 00:43:31,423
what's happening?

854
00:43:31,512 --> 00:43:34,797
Ahh, now,
are you going to go ahead...

855
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:38,722
and have those T.P.S. Reports
for us this afternoon?

856
00:43:38,811 --> 00:43:40,187
No.

857
00:43:41,438 --> 00:43:43,929
Ahh... yeah...

858
00:43:44,024 --> 00:43:45,899
So I guess we should
probably go ahead...

859
00:43:45,985 --> 00:43:48,855
and have a little talk, hmm?

860
00:43:48,946 --> 00:43:51,948
Not right now, Lumbergh,
I'm... I'm kinda busy.

861
00:43:52,033 --> 00:43:55,865
In fact, I'm going to have
to ask you to go ahead.

862
00:43:56,746 --> 00:43:57,943
Just come back another time.

863
00:43:58,038 --> 00:44:00,447
I got a meeting with the Bobs
in a couple of minutes.

864
00:44:01,543 --> 00:44:03,665
Uh, I wasn't aware
of a meeting with them.

865
00:44:03,753 --> 00:44:05,960
Yeah, they called me at home.

866
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,840
That sounds good, Peter.

867
00:44:11,928 --> 00:44:14,087
And, uh, we'll go ahead and...

868
00:44:14,181 --> 00:44:16,470
get this all fixed up for you.

869
00:44:16,558 --> 00:44:17,588
Great.

870
00:44:22,606 --> 00:44:25,310
Hi, Milton. What's happening?

871
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:28,935
L... I didn't receive
my paycheque this week.

872
00:44:29,029 --> 00:44:33,607
Uh, you're going to have to talk
to payroll about that.

873
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,946
I did and they said...

874
00:44:35,035 --> 00:44:36,826
Milt, we're gonna go ahead...

875
00:44:36,912 --> 00:44:40,613
and move you downstairs
into storage "B."

876
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:42,415
No, l... I...

877
00:44:42,501 --> 00:44:46,451
New people are coming,
and we need the space.

878
00:44:46,546 --> 00:44:47,792
But there's no space...

879
00:44:47,881 --> 00:44:51,464
So if you could go ahead
and pack your stuff...

880
00:44:51,552 --> 00:44:53,212
and move it down there...

881
00:44:53,303 --> 00:44:55,297
that would be terrific.

882
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:56,669
OK?

883
00:44:56,765 --> 00:44:58,759
Uh, excuse me...

884
00:44:58,851 --> 00:45:04,439
I believe you have my stapler,
please. Hmm.

885
00:45:04,566 --> 00:45:06,806
You've been missing
a lot of work lately.

886
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,060
I wouldn't say
I've been missing it, Bob.

887
00:45:10,489 --> 00:45:11,733
Good one.

888
00:45:11,823 --> 00:45:13,614
Oh, that's terrific, Peter.

889
00:45:13,699 --> 00:45:16,819
I'm sure you've... you've heard
some of the rumours...

890
00:45:16,911 --> 00:45:18,620
circulating
around the hallways...

891
00:45:18,705 --> 00:45:21,456
about how we're going to do
a little "housecleaning..."

892
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:22,786
with some software people.

893
00:45:22,876 --> 00:45:26,042
Well, Bob, I have heard that.
You gotta do what you gotta do.

894
00:45:26,129 --> 00:45:28,121
We'll be getting rid
of these people.

895
00:45:28,214 --> 00:45:33,007
First, Mr. Samir Naga...

896
00:45:33,095 --> 00:45:34,257
Naga...

897
00:45:34,346 --> 00:45:37,549
Naga-gonna work here
anymore, anyway.

898
00:45:37,641 --> 00:45:41,009
And Mr. Mike Bolton.
Nobody's gonna miss him.

899
00:45:41,102 --> 00:45:42,762
You're gonna layoff
Samir and Michael?

900
00:45:42,854 --> 00:45:45,346
Yeah. We're gonna bring
in some entry-level graduates.

901
00:45:45,441 --> 00:45:47,599
Farm some work out to Singapore,
that's the usual deal.

902
00:45:47,693 --> 00:45:48,938
It's standard
operating procedure.

903
00:45:49,027 --> 00:45:51,186
Do they know this yet?

904
00:45:51,279 --> 00:45:53,439
No. No, of course not.

905
00:45:53,532 --> 00:45:56,319
We find it's always better
to fire people on a Friday.

906
00:45:56,409 --> 00:45:58,617
Studies have
statistically shown...

907
00:45:58,704 --> 00:46:00,364
there's less chance
of an incident...

908
00:46:00,456 --> 00:46:02,115
if you do it at the end
of the week.

909
00:46:02,207 --> 00:46:05,291
Peter, what we'd like to do
is put you into position...

910
00:46:05,377 --> 00:46:09,043
to have as many
as four people...

911
00:46:09,132 --> 00:46:10,411
working right underneath you.

912
00:46:10,507 --> 00:46:12,631
This is a big promotion, Pete.

913
00:46:12,718 --> 00:46:15,340
So you're going
to fire Michael and Samir...

914
00:46:15,429 --> 00:46:17,256
and give me more money?

915
00:46:19,225 --> 00:46:20,933
Uh-huh.

916
00:46:21,018 --> 00:46:23,178
Wow!

917
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:26,225
Hmm. Yeah.

918
00:46:26,315 --> 00:46:29,104
That's it.
That's exactly what I need.

919
00:46:29,194 --> 00:46:30,438
Give it to me.

920
00:46:30,527 --> 00:46:31,987
Come on, you little fucker,
let's go.

921
00:46:32,071 --> 00:46:33,614
That's what I need.
Let's do that.

922
00:46:33,698 --> 00:46:36,236
Let's do exactly that,
you little fuck...

923
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:38,117
- Michael.
- Hey.

924
00:46:38,203 --> 00:46:39,578
Listen to me.

925
00:46:42,124 --> 00:46:43,702
What are you doing tonight?

926
00:46:45,251 --> 00:46:48,123
Michael, there comes
a point in a man's life...

927
00:46:48,213 --> 00:46:50,704
and maybe that time for you
is now...

928
00:46:51,841 --> 00:46:55,460
when it doesn't hurt to start
thinking about the future.

929
00:46:55,554 --> 00:46:57,630
Uh, no offence there, Peter...

930
00:46:57,723 --> 00:46:59,466
but speak for yourself there,
sport.

931
00:46:59,557 --> 00:47:02,725
I'm not the one who's been
flakin' out at work.

932
00:47:02,812 --> 00:47:06,809
I know you had this religious
experience or whatever...

933
00:47:06,899 --> 00:47:09,650
but get your shit together,
or you're gonna get canned.

934
00:47:10,653 --> 00:47:13,144
Yeah, and, uh, and l... Listen...

935
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:15,941
That virus
you're always talking about...

936
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:18,157
the one that could
rip off the company...

937
00:47:18,244 --> 00:47:19,654
for a bunch of money.

938
00:47:19,744 --> 00:47:20,990
Yeah, what about it?

939
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,740
Well, how does it work?

940
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:24,916
It's pretty brilliant.

941
00:47:25,001 --> 00:47:27,123
What it does is every time
there's a bank transaction...

942
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:29,619
where interest is computed...
There are thousands a day...

943
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:31,671
the computer ends up with
these fractions of a cent...

944
00:47:31,758 --> 00:47:33,253
which it usually rounds off.

945
00:47:33,343 --> 00:47:35,667
What this does is it takes
those little remainders...

946
00:47:35,761 --> 00:47:37,671
and puts it into an account.

947
00:47:37,764 --> 00:47:40,469
- This sounds familiar.
- They did it in "Superman III."

948
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:41,673
Right, uh...

949
00:47:41,768 --> 00:47:43,476
An underrated movie, actually.

950
00:47:43,562 --> 00:47:46,847
There were hackers that did it
in the seventies as well.

951
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:49,940
- So they check for this now.
- No, here's the thing.

952
00:47:50,026 --> 00:47:53,277
Initech's so backed up with all
the software we're updating...

953
00:47:53,364 --> 00:47:54,478
they'd never notice.

954
00:47:54,573 --> 00:47:56,565
You're right.

955
00:47:56,658 --> 00:47:58,983
Even if they wanted to, they
couldn't check all that code.

956
00:47:59,077 --> 00:48:02,078
Thumbs up their asses.
Thumbs up their asses.

957
00:48:02,163 --> 00:48:06,078
So, Michael, what's
to stop you from doing this?

958
00:48:06,168 --> 00:48:08,706
It's not worth the risk.
I got a good job.

959
00:48:09,921 --> 00:48:12,378
What if you didn't have
a good job?

960
00:48:13,842 --> 00:48:15,041
Cock gobblers!

961
00:48:18,722 --> 00:48:22,472
Samir and I are
the best programmers they got.

962
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,718
You haven't been showin' up,
and you get to keep your job.

963
00:48:24,811 --> 00:48:26,604
Actually, I'm being promoted.

964
00:48:26,689 --> 00:48:29,310
- What?
- I know, Michael.

965
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,891
It's completely unfair.

966
00:48:31,986 --> 00:48:34,441
And I realised something today.

967
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:37,448
It's not just about me
and my dream of doing nothing.

968
00:48:37,533 --> 00:48:39,526
It's about all of us together.

969
00:48:41,204 --> 00:48:44,537
I don't know what happened to me
at that hypnotherapist.

970
00:48:44,623 --> 00:48:47,115
Maybe it was just shock,
and it's wearing off now...

971
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:49,879
but when I saw that fat man
keel over and die...

972
00:48:49,963 --> 00:48:52,916
Michael, we don't have
a lot of time on this earth.

973
00:48:53,007 --> 00:48:55,925
We weren't meant to spend it
this way.

974
00:48:56,011 --> 00:48:59,296
Human beings were not meant
to sit in little cubicles...

975
00:48:59,388 --> 00:49:01,298
staring at computer screens
all day...

976
00:49:01,391 --> 00:49:02,471
filling out useless forms...

977
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,184
and listening
to eight different bosses...

978
00:49:04,269 --> 00:49:06,677
drone on
about mission statements.

979
00:49:06,772 --> 00:49:09,642
I told those fudgepackers
I liked Michael Bolton's music.

980
00:49:09,733 --> 00:49:13,397
Ohh. That is not right, Michael.

981
00:49:13,486 --> 00:49:16,322
For five years now,
you've worked your ass off...

982
00:49:16,407 --> 00:49:20,451
hoping for a promotion,
profit sharing, or something.

983
00:49:20,535 --> 00:49:21,911
Five years...

984
00:49:21,996 --> 00:49:24,783
of your mid-twenties now gone.

985
00:49:24,874 --> 00:49:26,119
And you're gonna
go in tomorrow...

986
00:49:26,208 --> 00:49:28,781
they're gonna throw you
out on the street.

987
00:49:28,877 --> 00:49:30,621
You know why?

988
00:49:30,713 --> 00:49:35,125
So Bill Lumbergh's stock
will go up a quarter of a point.

989
00:49:35,217 --> 00:49:36,795
Ugh.

990
00:49:36,886 --> 00:49:38,962
Michael, let's make
that stock go down...

991
00:49:39,055 --> 00:49:41,012
and let's take enough money
out of that place...

992
00:49:41,098 --> 00:49:44,384
so that we never have
to sit in a cubicle ever again.

993
00:49:45,854 --> 00:49:47,762
Your software works, right?

994
00:49:47,854 --> 00:49:49,515
Of course it works.
That's not the point.

995
00:49:50,984 --> 00:49:53,060
Even if I wanted to, I wouldn't
know how to install it.

996
00:49:53,152 --> 00:49:55,643
I don't know the credit union's
software well enough. OK?

997
00:49:55,738 --> 00:49:58,692
Yeah. But Samir does.

998
00:49:59,534 --> 00:50:00,993
But that's not much money.

999
00:50:01,078 --> 00:50:02,274
That's the beauty of it.

1000
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:06,415
Each withdrawal, it's a fraction
of a cent, too small to notice.

1001
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,657
But you take a few thousand
withdrawals a day...

1002
00:50:08,751 --> 00:50:10,162
you space it out
over a couple of years...

1003
00:50:10,253 --> 00:50:12,495
that's a few
hundred thousand dollars.

1004
00:50:12,589 --> 00:50:13,787
It's like "Superman III."

1005
00:50:13,882 --> 00:50:15,921
"Superman lll"?

1006
00:50:16,009 --> 00:50:19,674
I have to leave now.
I have to get my résumé ready.

1007
00:50:19,763 --> 00:50:23,926
For another job where
they can fire you for no reason?

1008
00:50:24,017 --> 00:50:26,722
That's right. If I'm lucky.

1009
00:50:26,811 --> 00:50:30,940
I'm tired of being
pushed around. Aren't you?

1010
00:50:31,025 --> 00:50:33,776
Yes, but I'm not going to do
anything illegal.

1011
00:50:33,861 --> 00:50:36,268
Illegal?
Samir, this is America.

1012
00:50:36,363 --> 00:50:38,402
Come on. Sit down.

1013
00:50:39,366 --> 00:50:41,572
Come on. This isn't Riyadh.

1014
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:44,578
They're not going
to saw your hands off here.

1015
00:50:44,663 --> 00:50:47,035
The worst they'd do is put you
for a couple of months...

1016
00:50:47,124 --> 00:50:50,411
into a white-collar,
minimum-security resort.

1017
00:50:50,504 --> 00:50:54,168
Shit, we should be so lucky.
They have conjugal visits there.

1018
00:50:54,257 --> 00:50:55,882
- Really?
- Yes.

1019
00:50:55,966 --> 00:50:57,247
Shit!

1020
00:50:57,343 --> 00:51:00,095
I'm a free man. I haven't had
a conjugal visit in six months.

1021
00:51:00,179 --> 00:51:01,922
So what do you think?

1022
00:51:02,014 --> 00:51:04,506
This thing is actually
pretty fail-safe, Samir.

1023
00:51:04,601 --> 00:51:05,798
Samir?

1024
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,273
You came here looking
for a land of opportunity.

1025
00:51:10,357 --> 00:51:13,476
And this is the knock
of that opportunity.

1026
00:51:13,568 --> 00:51:15,940
Tomorrow is your last day
at Initech.

1027
00:51:16,028 --> 00:51:17,523
You have two options...

1028
00:51:17,614 --> 00:51:19,986
unemployment
or early retirement.

1029
00:51:20,075 --> 00:51:21,652
What's it gonna be?

1030
00:51:22,452 --> 00:51:24,030
- I have a question.
- Yes?

1031
00:51:24,121 --> 00:51:27,821
In this conjugal visits,
you can have sex with women?

1032
00:51:27,916 --> 00:51:30,621
Yep, you sure can.

1033
00:51:34,131 --> 00:51:35,294
OK, I'll do it.

1034
00:51:35,381 --> 00:51:38,253
That's what I'm talkin'
about when I talk about America!

1035
00:51:38,344 --> 00:51:39,720
Can we discuss the plan?

1036
00:51:39,804 --> 00:51:41,463
OK, yeah, good, right.

1037
00:51:41,554 --> 00:51:43,014
It works like a computer virus.

1038
00:51:43,098 --> 00:51:45,672
All we do is load it into
the credit union's mainframe.

1039
00:51:45,767 --> 00:51:46,931
It'll do the rest.

1040
00:51:47,018 --> 00:51:49,344
Get me that disk,
and I'll take it from there.

1041
00:51:49,438 --> 00:51:52,273
Before we go any further,
all right?

1042
00:51:52,358 --> 00:51:54,849
We have to swear to God,
Allah...

1043
00:51:54,944 --> 00:51:57,435
that nobody knows about this
but us, all right?

1044
00:51:57,530 --> 00:52:00,614
No family members,
no girlfriends. Nobody.

1045
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,897
- Of course.
- Agreed.

1046
00:52:01,992 --> 00:52:04,151
Don't worry, man!
I won't tell anyone, either.

1047
00:52:04,245 --> 00:52:06,451
- What the fuck is that?
- Don't worry. He's cool.

1048
00:52:06,539 --> 00:52:09,907
All right. Here's how
I see it all going down.

1049
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,788
Peter, congratulations.
This is one heck of a promotion.

1050
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:14,077
Thank you, Bob.

1051
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:16,460
We'll get some people
under you right away.

1052
00:53:42,178 --> 00:53:43,424
That was easy.

1053
00:53:43,513 --> 00:53:45,506
Yeah, I guess it was.

1054
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,176
What'd you do with the...

1055
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:49,141
Hey, man.

1056
00:53:49,227 --> 00:53:50,887
Oh, hey, Drew.

1057
00:53:50,979 --> 00:53:52,604
You guys hear
about Tom Smykowski?

1058
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:53,767
That he got laid off?

1059
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:55,351
No, man, check it out.

1060
00:53:55,442 --> 00:53:57,981
Last week, after he found out
he was getting laid off...

1061
00:53:58,070 --> 00:54:01,438
he tries to kill himself by
running the car in the garage.

1062
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:02,646
Is he dead?

1063
00:54:02,741 --> 00:54:04,283
No, man, check it out.

1064
00:54:04,367 --> 00:54:07,488
His wife comes home early
and catches him.

1065
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,453
He tries to play it off
like nothing happened.

1066
00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:12,458
I was having some trouble
with the shifter here.

1067
00:54:12,543 --> 00:54:13,823
It's jammed.

1068
00:54:13,919 --> 00:54:16,375
L... I couldn't get it
into drive.

1069
00:54:16,463 --> 00:54:19,133
- L... l...I mean, reverse.
- You OK, Tom?

1070
00:54:19,216 --> 00:54:21,506
Then as he's lookin' at her...

1071
00:54:21,594 --> 00:54:23,586
he decides he wants to live.

1072
00:54:23,679 --> 00:54:25,138
Yeah, I think I'm OK.

1073
00:54:25,222 --> 00:54:26,598
Right.

1074
00:54:26,683 --> 00:54:28,840
Seems to be working now.

1075
00:54:30,644 --> 00:54:32,353
See you later, honey.

1076
00:54:32,439 --> 00:54:33,683
Love ya.

1077
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:39,142
But as soon as he backs
out of his driveway... Bam!

1078
00:54:39,237 --> 00:54:41,859
He gets slammed big-time
by a drunk driver.

1079
00:54:41,949 --> 00:54:43,904
- Is he OK?
- Sort of.

1080
00:54:43,991 --> 00:54:47,112
Broke both his wrists, legs,
a couple of ribs, his back...

1081
00:54:47,204 --> 00:54:49,362
but he's getting
a huge settlement out of this.

1082
00:54:49,456 --> 00:54:50,618
Like seven figures.

1083
00:54:50,707 --> 00:54:52,201
He's getting out
of the hospital tomorrow.

1084
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:54,201
He's throwing a big party
this weekend to celebrate.

1085
00:54:54,294 --> 00:54:56,287
We're all invited.

1086
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:59,000
I'm thinking I might take
that new chick from logistics.

1087
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:01,629
Things go well, I might be
showing her my "Oh" face.

1088
00:55:01,719 --> 00:55:04,090
Oh, oh, oh...

1089
00:55:04,178 --> 00:55:07,215
You know what I'm talking about.
Oh.

1090
00:55:07,307 --> 00:55:09,430
Yeah. Right.

1091
00:55:09,518 --> 00:55:10,847
See you guys there.

1092
00:55:12,186 --> 00:55:15,391
Wow, our last day at Initech.

1093
00:55:16,692 --> 00:55:18,684
I can't believe
they had security escort us out.

1094
00:55:18,777 --> 00:55:21,019
It's not like
we're going to steal something.

1095
00:55:23,282 --> 00:55:24,397
I stole something.

1096
00:55:24,492 --> 00:55:26,484
Oh, yeah. I guess we all did.

1097
00:55:26,577 --> 00:55:29,246
No, I stole something else.

1098
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:31,749
What did you steal?

1099
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:35,623
Call it a going-away present.

1100
00:57:12,852 --> 00:57:14,311
Who's got my keys?

1101
00:57:14,396 --> 00:57:15,771
I'm driving.

1102
00:57:15,855 --> 00:57:17,516
Everything is gonna be OK.

1103
00:57:17,608 --> 00:57:19,434
All right? OK?

1104
00:57:19,526 --> 00:57:21,103
It's fun, and it's exciting.

1105
00:57:21,194 --> 00:57:23,733
I gotta... I gotta go. All right?

1106
00:57:23,822 --> 00:57:24,984
Joanna's coming over.

1107
00:57:25,073 --> 00:57:28,240
Don't worry.
You're worrying. All right?

1108
00:57:28,327 --> 00:57:30,449
Monday morning, we're gonna
check the account balance.

1109
00:57:30,537 --> 00:57:31,617
Everything will be OK.

1110
00:57:31,705 --> 00:57:33,828
Don't miss Tom's barbecue.
I'll see you there.

1111
00:57:33,916 --> 00:57:35,623
All right? Good night!

1112
00:57:35,709 --> 00:57:38,379
Back up in your ass
with the resurrection

1113
00:57:40,964 --> 00:57:43,088
What were you guys
celebrating last night?

1114
00:57:43,175 --> 00:57:47,884
Oh, um... l'm not really
at liberty to talk about it.

1115
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,725
I really can't.

1116
00:57:55,437 --> 00:57:58,475
So, when the subroutine
compounds the interest...

1117
00:57:58,566 --> 00:58:00,772
it uses all these
extra decimal places...

1118
00:58:00,859 --> 00:58:02,734
that just get rounded off.

1119
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,363
So we simplified
the whole thing...

1120
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:07,697
and we round 'em all down
and drop the remainder...

1121
00:58:07,783 --> 00:58:09,776
into an account that we opened.

1122
00:58:10,912 --> 00:58:12,323
So you're stealing?

1123
00:58:13,373 --> 00:58:15,199
Uh, no.
No, you don't understand.

1124
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:19,040
It's, uh, very complicated.
It's, uh...

1125
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:22,129
It's aggregate, so I'm talking
about fractions of a penny...

1126
00:58:22,215 --> 00:58:25,500
and, uh, over time,
they add up to a lot.

1127
00:58:25,593 --> 00:58:29,293
Oh, OK. So you're gonna make
a lot of money, right?

1128
00:58:29,388 --> 00:58:30,669
- Yeah.
- Right.

1129
00:58:30,765 --> 00:58:31,845
It's not yours?

1130
00:58:31,933 --> 00:58:34,092
Uh... well, it becomes ours.

1131
00:58:34,185 --> 00:58:36,012
How is that not stealing?

1132
00:58:38,691 --> 00:58:41,894
I don't think
I'm explaining this very well.

1133
00:58:41,986 --> 00:58:45,069
Um, the 7-Eleven, right?

1134
00:58:45,155 --> 00:58:47,397
You'd take a penny
from the tray.

1135
00:58:47,491 --> 00:58:48,737
From the crippled children?

1136
00:58:48,826 --> 00:58:49,939
No, that's the jar.

1137
00:58:50,034 --> 00:58:53,535
I'm talking about the tray...
The pennies for everybody.

1138
00:58:53,623 --> 00:58:54,951
Oh, for everybody. OK.

1139
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,116
Yeah.
Well, those are whole pennies.

1140
00:58:57,209 --> 00:59:01,124
I'm just talking about
fractions of a penny, OK?

1141
00:59:01,213 --> 00:59:02,957
But we do it
from a much bigger tray...

1142
00:59:03,049 --> 00:59:05,124
and we do it
a couple of million times.

1143
00:59:05,217 --> 00:59:06,628
So what's wrong with that?

1144
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:08,344
I don't know.
It just seems wrong.

1145
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:09,592
It's not wrong.

1146
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,842
Initech is wrong.

1147
00:59:10,931 --> 00:59:13,423
Initech is an evil corporation,
all right?

1148
00:59:13,517 --> 00:59:15,594
Chotchkie's is wrong.

1149
00:59:15,687 --> 00:59:17,595
Doesn't it bother you that you
have to get up in the morning...

1150
00:59:17,688 --> 00:59:19,681
and you have to put on
a bunch of pieces of flair?

1151
00:59:19,773 --> 00:59:22,146
Yeah, but I'm not about
to go in and start...

1152
00:59:22,235 --> 00:59:23,895
taking money from the register.

1153
00:59:23,987 --> 00:59:25,184
Well, maybe you should.

1154
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:30,275
The Nazis had pieces of flair
that they made the Jews wear.

1155
00:59:30,368 --> 00:59:31,613
What?

1156
00:59:33,329 --> 00:59:34,954
Look, we don't... l'm...

1157
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,664
We don't have
to talk about this now.

1158
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:40,249
Let's just go to the barbecue,
all right?

1159
00:59:43,339 --> 00:59:46,009
Michael, Samir,
how you doin'?

1160
00:59:46,092 --> 00:59:47,207
- Hey, Tom.
- Hello, Tom.

1161
00:59:47,302 --> 00:59:50,339
I'd like you to meet
my lawyer Rob Newhouse.

1162
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:53,134
Rob, Michael. Samir.

1163
00:59:53,224 --> 00:59:56,677
Peter! How are you?
I'm glad you could make it.

1164
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:59,770
Tom, hi. This is somebody
I'd like you to meet.

1165
00:59:59,856 --> 01:00:01,683
- This is, uh, Joanna.
- Hi.

1166
01:00:01,775 --> 01:00:04,183
Hi. Forgive me
for not getting up.

1167
01:00:10,868 --> 01:00:13,702
Ooh, ooh.

1168
01:00:13,787 --> 01:00:16,195
Peter, come here a minute.
I wanna show you something.

1169
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:20,163
Well... what do you think?
It's a prototype.

1170
01:00:20,253 --> 01:00:21,996
Huh... that's...

1171
01:00:22,088 --> 01:00:24,661
that's exactly as you
described it.

1172
01:00:26,676 --> 01:00:29,166
Uh, listen, I heard about
your... your settlement.

1173
01:00:29,261 --> 01:00:30,424
Congratulations.

1174
01:00:30,513 --> 01:00:31,628
Well, thanks, Peter.

1175
01:00:31,723 --> 01:00:35,590
You know, I'm glad you're here,
because I wanted to talk to you.

1176
01:00:35,685 --> 01:00:39,018
I know how you get depressed
about your job and all, and...

1177
01:00:39,105 --> 01:00:41,775
I just wanted you to know
that I know how you feel.

1178
01:00:41,858 --> 01:00:43,517
I used to be the same way.

1179
01:00:43,609 --> 01:00:45,603
- Really?
- Sure.

1180
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:47,319
Maybe I didn't whine as much.

1181
01:00:47,405 --> 01:00:50,240
But I bet I hated my job
even more than you...

1182
01:00:50,325 --> 01:00:52,613
and I'd been doing it
for over thirty years.

1183
01:00:52,702 --> 01:00:53,983
Wow.

1184
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:57,613
Just remember, if you
hang in there long enough...

1185
01:00:57,707 --> 01:01:00,958
good things can happen
in this world.

1186
01:01:01,045 --> 01:01:03,119
I mean, look at me.

1187
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:05,542
Thanks, Tom.

1188
01:01:06,592 --> 01:01:08,465
Ah, sure.

1189
01:01:13,849 --> 01:01:17,051
Conjugal visits?
Not that I know of.

1190
01:01:17,143 --> 01:01:19,765
Minimum-security prison
is no picnic.

1191
01:01:19,855 --> 01:01:21,978
I have a client in there
right now.

1192
01:01:22,065 --> 01:01:23,691
He says the trick is...

1193
01:01:23,776 --> 01:01:25,603
kick someone's ass
the first day...

1194
01:01:25,694 --> 01:01:27,153
or become someone's bitch.

1195
01:01:27,237 --> 01:01:29,812
Then everything
will be all right.

1196
01:01:29,908 --> 01:01:31,531
Why do you ask, anyway?

1197
01:01:31,616 --> 01:01:33,859
Oh, no, we just...

1198
01:01:33,953 --> 01:01:35,151
It's a...

1199
01:01:41,418 --> 01:01:43,459
- Hey, Peter.
- Drew.

1200
01:01:43,546 --> 01:01:45,704
That's something
about old Smykowski, huh?

1201
01:01:45,798 --> 01:01:47,589
- Yeah.
- Lucky bastard.

1202
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:51,927
Hey, isn't that the girl
that works over at Chotchkie's?

1203
01:01:52,013 --> 01:01:53,756
Yep.

1204
01:01:53,848 --> 01:01:55,426
Who's she here with?

1205
01:01:55,517 --> 01:01:56,797
She's with me.

1206
01:01:58,645 --> 01:02:00,768
- Really?
- Yep.

1207
01:02:00,856 --> 01:02:04,307
All right, Peter.
Ooh, ooh, right on.

1208
01:02:05,361 --> 01:02:07,482
Make sure you wear a rubber,
dude.

1209
01:02:09,781 --> 01:02:10,895
Why's that, Drew?

1210
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:12,616
Are you kidding me?

1211
01:02:12,701 --> 01:02:14,777
She gets around. All right?

1212
01:02:16,287 --> 01:02:18,281
She does, does she?

1213
01:02:18,374 --> 01:02:20,496
Oh, yeah, like a record.

1214
01:02:23,378 --> 01:02:24,790
Like with who?

1215
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,797
Oh, let's see, uh...

1216
01:02:27,883 --> 01:02:30,042
Hell, Lumbergh fucked her.

1217
01:02:31,178 --> 01:02:32,886
Uh, let me see, who else?

1218
01:02:34,974 --> 01:02:36,136
Lumbergh?

1219
01:02:38,519 --> 01:02:40,844
What if you get caught?

1220
01:02:40,938 --> 01:02:44,141
Oh, I just don't know
if this was such a good idea.

1221
01:02:44,233 --> 01:02:47,270
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea
for you to sleep with Lumbergh.

1222
01:02:47,362 --> 01:02:48,689
What?

1223
01:02:48,779 --> 01:02:49,978
What are you...

1224
01:02:51,156 --> 01:02:53,114
Oh, right, Lumbergh.

1225
01:02:53,201 --> 01:02:54,660
Aah!

1226
01:02:54,745 --> 01:02:57,864
Oh... God... Lumbergh!

1227
01:02:57,955 --> 01:02:59,949
Peter, what is wrong with you?

1228
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:01,749
That was, like, two years ago.

1229
01:03:01,835 --> 01:03:03,210
What? Did you know him?

1230
01:03:03,294 --> 01:03:04,872
Yeah, I know him. I know him.

1231
01:03:04,963 --> 01:03:06,243
He's my boss.

1232
01:03:06,339 --> 01:03:09,755
He's my unholy,
disgusting pig of a boss.

1233
01:03:09,843 --> 01:03:11,882
Oh, he's not that disgusting.

1234
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:15,173
He represents all
that is soulless and wrong...

1235
01:03:15,265 --> 01:03:16,972
and you slept with him.

1236
01:03:17,058 --> 01:03:20,427
Hey, that is none
of your business, OK?

1237
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:23,356
I didn't ask you who you slept
with before we were together.

1238
01:03:23,441 --> 01:03:24,603
I don't care.

1239
01:03:24,691 --> 01:03:26,767
I didn't think you
slept with guys like Lumbergh!

1240
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:29,019
Listen to you.

1241
01:03:29,113 --> 01:03:30,571
Who do you think you are?

1242
01:03:30,656 --> 01:03:33,147
How dare you judge me?

1243
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:36,029
I mean, what are you?
You think you're an angel?

1244
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,824
No, you're just
this penny-stealing...

1245
01:03:38,914 --> 01:03:41,583
wannabe criminal man.

1246
01:03:41,667 --> 01:03:43,327
Yeah, well, that may be.

1247
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:45,874
But at least I never
slept with Lumbergh.

1248
01:03:45,962 --> 01:03:47,243
OK, that's... l'm done.

1249
01:03:47,339 --> 01:03:50,590
I wanna get out of the car, OK?
Stop.

1250
01:03:50,676 --> 01:03:52,467
Call me when you grow up.

1251
01:03:52,553 --> 01:03:54,711
Wait. That's probably
never gonna happen.

1252
01:03:54,805 --> 01:03:55,920
So don't call me, OK?

1253
01:03:56,015 --> 01:03:58,222
Say hello to Lumbergh for me!

1254
01:04:05,149 --> 01:04:06,940
Hell, Lumbergh fucked her.

1255
01:04:07,026 --> 01:04:08,569
Lumbergh fucked her.

1256
01:04:08,653 --> 01:04:10,811
Lumbergh fucked her.

1257
01:04:10,905 --> 01:04:12,815
That is great.

1258
01:04:12,908 --> 01:04:15,943
I mean, she was seeing
the "Oh" face for sure.

1259
01:04:16,035 --> 01:04:19,784
Ohh, ohh, ohh.

1260
01:04:19,873 --> 01:04:21,450
Ooh.

1261
01:04:21,541 --> 01:04:24,162
If you could just move
a little bit to the left.

1262
01:04:24,252 --> 01:04:26,625
That's it. Great.

1263
01:04:26,713 --> 01:04:28,835
Peter, what's happening?

1264
01:04:28,923 --> 01:04:33,799
Um, could you give me
those T.P.S. Reports ASAP, OK?

1265
01:04:33,887 --> 01:04:35,049
Oh!

1266
01:04:49,277 --> 01:04:50,855
- Joanna.
- Yeah.

1267
01:04:51,447 --> 01:04:53,239
We need to talk.

1268
01:04:53,324 --> 01:04:55,197
Do you know what this is about?

1269
01:04:59,121 --> 01:05:00,781
My, uh, flair?

1270
01:05:00,873 --> 01:05:02,949
Yeah.

1271
01:05:03,042 --> 01:05:06,826
Or your lack of flair,
because, uh...

1272
01:05:06,921 --> 01:05:09,292
I'm counting,
and I only see fifteen pieces.

1273
01:05:09,381 --> 01:05:11,670
Let me ask you a question,
Joanna.

1274
01:05:11,759 --> 01:05:15,888
What do you think of a person
who only does the bare minimum?

1275
01:05:17,432 --> 01:05:20,136
Huh, what do I think?
Um, you know what, Stan...

1276
01:05:21,394 --> 01:05:24,430
if you want me to wear
thirty-seven pieces of flair...

1277
01:05:24,522 --> 01:05:26,811
like your, uh, pretty boy
over there, Brian...

1278
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:28,477
why don't you just
make the minimum...

1279
01:05:28,568 --> 01:05:30,525
thirty-seven pieces of flair?

1280
01:05:30,611 --> 01:05:33,185
Well, I thought
I remembered you saying...

1281
01:05:33,281 --> 01:05:35,488
that you wanted
to express yourself.

1282
01:05:35,575 --> 01:05:37,532
Yeah.
You know what? Yeah, I do.

1283
01:05:37,619 --> 01:05:40,074
I do want to express myself.

1284
01:05:40,163 --> 01:05:42,998
And I don't need thirty-seven
pieces of flair to do it.

1285
01:05:44,542 --> 01:05:47,116
All right? There's my flair. OK?

1286
01:05:47,212 --> 01:05:51,506
And this is me
expressing myself. OK?

1287
01:05:51,591 --> 01:05:53,299
There it is.

1288
01:05:53,384 --> 01:05:54,927
I hate this job.

1289
01:05:55,012 --> 01:05:57,681
I hate this goddamn job,
and I don't need it.

1290
01:06:13,488 --> 01:06:14,568
Oh, shit.

1291
01:06:14,657 --> 01:06:16,235
- Shit.
- Shit.

1292
01:06:16,325 --> 01:06:18,816
- Shit.
- Son of a bitch.

1293
01:06:18,911 --> 01:06:21,616
- Shit.
- This is a fuck.

1294
01:06:21,706 --> 01:06:22,784
L... I...Shit.

1295
01:06:22,873 --> 01:06:24,284
What happened?

1296
01:06:24,375 --> 01:06:26,534
You tell me, Michael!
It's your software!

1297
01:06:26,628 --> 01:06:28,169
Yes, it's your software.

1298
01:06:28,253 --> 01:06:30,413
Corporate accounting
is sure as hell gonna notice...

1299
01:06:30,507 --> 01:06:33,176
three hundred five thousand,
three hundred...

1300
01:06:33,259 --> 01:06:36,463
twenty-six thirteen, Michael!

1301
01:06:36,554 --> 01:06:37,882
Oh, shit.

1302
01:06:37,972 --> 01:06:39,965
They probably
won't know it's gone...

1303
01:06:40,058 --> 01:06:41,766
for another three or four days.

1304
01:06:41,850 --> 01:06:45,386
Michael! You said this thing
was gonna take two years.

1305
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,935
What happened? You said
the thing was supposed to work!

1306
01:06:48,024 --> 01:06:49,269
Technically, it did work.

1307
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:50,640
No, it didn't!

1308
01:06:50,736 --> 01:06:53,606
It did not work, Michael, OK?

1309
01:06:53,697 --> 01:06:55,274
OK.

1310
01:06:55,365 --> 01:06:58,485
I must have put a decimal point
in the wrong place or something.

1311
01:06:58,577 --> 01:07:01,116
I always do that. I always
mess up some mundane detail.

1312
01:07:01,205 --> 01:07:05,249
Oh! Well, this is not
a mundane detail, Michael!

1313
01:07:05,334 --> 01:07:06,828
Quit getting pissed at me.

1314
01:07:06,918 --> 01:07:08,828
This was all your idea, asshole.

1315
01:07:10,088 --> 01:07:12,045
All right. OK.

1316
01:07:12,132 --> 01:07:14,624
Let's try not to get
pissed off at each other.

1317
01:07:14,719 --> 01:07:17,209
Let's calm down, try to figure
this thing out together.

1318
01:07:17,304 --> 01:07:20,970
We gotta close that account
before it gets bigger.

1319
01:07:21,059 --> 01:07:25,222
WORKERS
Happy birthday to you

1320
01:07:25,313 --> 01:07:30,270
Happy birthday to you

1321
01:07:30,359 --> 01:07:35,947
Happy birthday, Mr. Lumbergh

1322
01:07:36,032 --> 01:07:40,160
Happy birthday to you

1323
01:07:44,457 --> 01:07:45,786
Looks terrific.

1324
01:07:45,874 --> 01:07:46,989
Mmm.

1325
01:07:47,084 --> 01:07:49,790
Here, Peg, you wanna
get everybody started?

1326
01:07:53,049 --> 01:07:54,212
Mmm.

1327
01:07:54,301 --> 01:07:55,676
Oh, that is terrific.

1328
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,041
Just terrific.

1329
01:07:57,137 --> 01:08:00,920
Thanks, everybody.
I really, really appreciate it.

1330
01:08:01,015 --> 01:08:02,296
It's very special.

1331
01:08:02,392 --> 01:08:04,599
Now, Milton, don't be greedy.

1332
01:08:04,687 --> 01:08:07,936
Let's pass it along and make
sure everyone gets a piece.

1333
01:08:08,023 --> 01:08:11,107
But last time I didn't
receive a piece and I was told...

1334
01:08:11,193 --> 01:08:12,686
Just pass.

1335
01:08:12,777 --> 01:08:17,985
OK, here. But this...

1336
01:08:19,576 --> 01:08:23,076
The cake...
There's lots of cake?

1337
01:08:24,123 --> 01:08:27,123
The ratio of people to cake
is too big.

1338
01:08:44,394 --> 01:08:47,099
I could set
the building on fire.

1339
01:08:47,188 --> 01:08:51,268
Is there some way
to just give the money back?

1340
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:54,147
Hand them a cheque for the exact
amount they're missing?

1341
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:57,154
L... I think
they'd figure that out.

1342
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:59,482
Well, we have to do something.

1343
01:08:59,576 --> 01:09:01,568
Maybe we could launder
the money.

1344
01:09:02,912 --> 01:09:04,869
That's a great idea.

1345
01:09:04,956 --> 01:09:05,987
OK, how do we do that?

1346
01:09:06,082 --> 01:09:07,791
I don't know.

1347
01:09:07,876 --> 01:09:09,536
I don't even know what it means.
I was hoping you knew.

1348
01:09:09,627 --> 01:09:11,335
I think coke dealers do it.

1349
01:09:11,421 --> 01:09:13,995
OK, all right.
Do we know any coke dealers?

1350
01:09:14,883 --> 01:09:16,377
My cousin's a cokehead.

1351
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:23,432
Fuck.

1352
01:09:23,517 --> 01:09:24,761
We're in deep shit.

1353
01:09:24,851 --> 01:09:28,517
Yes, we are in very,
very deep shit.

1354
01:09:33,527 --> 01:09:35,436
- Milton.
- Yes.

1355
01:09:35,529 --> 01:09:36,691
What's happening?

1356
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:39,271
Say, Milton,
you know what'd be great?

1357
01:09:39,366 --> 01:09:40,445
But... no.

1358
01:09:40,534 --> 01:09:42,278
Since you're down here...

1359
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:45,572
it would be really great
if you could just sort of...

1360
01:09:45,664 --> 01:09:48,417
take care of the cockroach
problem we've had in here.

1361
01:09:48,501 --> 01:09:51,501
That's really not my job, and I
haven't received my paycheque...

1362
01:09:51,587 --> 01:09:53,379
For now,
why don't you go ahead...

1363
01:09:53,464 --> 01:09:56,798
and get yourself a flashlight
and a can of pesticide...

1364
01:09:56,885 --> 01:09:58,047
and crawl down...

1365
01:09:58,135 --> 01:10:00,543
Bill?
We need you upstairs right away.

1366
01:10:00,638 --> 01:10:02,465
We got a big problem... big.

1367
01:10:02,557 --> 01:10:05,474
Some major glitch in accounting,
a lot of money missing.

1368
01:10:10,690 --> 01:10:11,853
'Scuse me.

1369
01:10:13,692 --> 01:10:14,855
'Scuse me.

1370
01:10:17,531 --> 01:10:21,445
OK... but that's
the last straw.

1371
01:10:21,534 --> 01:10:23,942
Here we go, here we go.

1372
01:10:24,037 --> 01:10:28,284
Uh, launder.
"To clean," no. "To wash..."

1373
01:10:28,375 --> 01:10:31,578
"To conceal the source
of money...

1374
01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:34,920
"as by channelling it through
an intermediary."

1375
01:10:35,715 --> 01:10:37,091
"To conceal..."

1376
01:10:37,176 --> 01:10:39,631
That doesn't really
help us, Michael.

1377
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,428
I can't believe
what a bunch of nerds we are.

1378
01:10:41,513 --> 01:10:43,636
We're looking up money
laundering in a dictionary.

1379
01:10:43,723 --> 01:10:48,219
Yeah, well, you guys
can both eat my ass, OK?

1380
01:10:48,311 --> 01:10:50,020
I can't believe Joanna
slept with Lumbergh.

1381
01:10:50,105 --> 01:10:51,268
That's what I can't believe.

1382
01:10:51,357 --> 01:10:54,310
- Yeah. You didn't know that?
- Yeah, you didn't know that?

1383
01:10:54,401 --> 01:10:56,441
A couple of years ago,
before he moved to Atlanta.

1384
01:10:58,906 --> 01:11:02,774
You mean Ron Lumbergh,
the Initrode guy? The young guy?

1385
01:11:02,869 --> 01:11:05,360
Yeah.
Who'd you think I meant? Bill?

1386
01:11:07,415 --> 01:11:10,250
Her fucking... Her children
would have hooves.

1387
01:11:12,128 --> 01:11:13,788
Ron's not related to Bill,
is he?

1388
01:11:15,256 --> 01:11:16,964
Who's that?

1389
01:11:17,967 --> 01:11:19,461
All right, nobody panic.

1390
01:11:19,552 --> 01:11:21,213
Probably just Lawrence.

1391
01:11:24,724 --> 01:11:26,468
Good evening, sir.
My name is Steve.

1392
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,053
I come from a rough area.

1393
01:11:28,144 --> 01:11:29,721
I used to be addicted
to crack...

1394
01:11:29,812 --> 01:11:31,687
but now I'm off
and trying to stay clean.

1395
01:11:31,773 --> 01:11:34,181
That is why I'm selling
magazine subscriptions.

1396
01:11:34,276 --> 01:11:36,269
- No, no.
- Wait a minute.

1397
01:11:36,361 --> 01:11:38,318
You used to be
addicted to crack?

1398
01:11:39,572 --> 01:11:41,115
Yeah. Um...

1399
01:11:42,743 --> 01:11:44,865
Look, I'm very sorry.

1400
01:11:44,953 --> 01:11:47,444
I do not know anything
about any money laundering.

1401
01:11:47,539 --> 01:11:49,947
We're not asking you
about money laundering.

1402
01:11:50,042 --> 01:11:51,417
All we need is for you
to hook us...

1403
01:11:51,501 --> 01:11:53,293
If he doesn't
know anybody...

1404
01:11:53,378 --> 01:11:55,122
No. Wait a minute.

1405
01:11:55,214 --> 01:11:58,130
Look, you just give us
the name of one drug dealer.

1406
01:11:58,216 --> 01:12:00,625
I could talk to him.
I have good networking skill.

1407
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:01,835
I lied.

1408
01:12:01,929 --> 01:12:04,965
All that stuff I said
about being a crackhead...

1409
01:12:05,057 --> 01:12:07,464
just helps me sell magazines.

1410
01:12:07,559 --> 01:12:10,051
I'm actually an unemployed
software engineer.

1411
01:12:13,857 --> 01:12:16,942
- You're a software engineer?
- Yep.

1412
01:12:17,027 --> 01:12:19,565
Things, they must be
very rough for you.

1413
01:12:19,655 --> 01:12:21,280
Actually, man...

1414
01:12:21,366 --> 01:12:23,358
I make more money selling
magazine subscriptions...

1415
01:12:23,451 --> 01:12:24,910
than I ever did at Initrode.

1416
01:12:24,995 --> 01:12:27,116
Heh. At Initrode?

1417
01:12:27,204 --> 01:12:29,162
Wait a minute,
you're not gonna tell anybody...

1418
01:12:29,248 --> 01:12:30,577
about all this stuff
we told you.

1419
01:12:30,667 --> 01:12:33,869
I mean, we know a lot of
the same people. That's...

1420
01:12:35,714 --> 01:12:38,383
Actually, um,
that all depends.

1421
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:46,347
What am I gonna do with
forty subscriptions to "Vibe"?

1422
01:12:47,642 --> 01:12:48,721
We never should have done this.

1423
01:12:48,810 --> 01:12:50,637
What were we thinking?

1424
01:12:51,563 --> 01:12:52,642
You know what I can't
figure out?

1425
01:12:52,731 --> 01:12:55,898
How is it that all these stupid
Neanderthal Mafia guys...

1426
01:12:55,984 --> 01:12:57,359
can be so good at crime...

1427
01:12:57,444 --> 01:12:59,936
and smart guys like us
can suck so badly at it?

1428
01:13:00,031 --> 01:13:01,571
We're new to it, though.

1429
01:13:01,656 --> 01:13:04,148
If we had more experience...

1430
01:13:04,243 --> 01:13:07,612
No. You know what I think?
I think we're screwed.

1431
01:13:07,705 --> 01:13:09,163
I think
there's enough evidence...

1432
01:13:09,248 --> 01:13:11,287
all over that building
to link us to this.

1433
01:13:11,374 --> 01:13:13,451
Even if we could launder money,
I wouldn't want to.

1434
01:13:13,544 --> 01:13:15,121
What we've done is bad enough.

1435
01:13:15,212 --> 01:13:16,456
We get caught
laundering money...

1436
01:13:16,546 --> 01:13:18,504
we're not going
to white-collar resort prison.

1437
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:21,508
No. We're going to federal
"pound me in the ass" prison.

1438
01:13:21,594 --> 01:13:23,633
I don't want to go
to any prison.

1439
01:13:23,721 --> 01:13:25,962
Why the hell did I do this?

1440
01:13:26,056 --> 01:13:28,727
I've never done anything wrong
in my whole life.

1441
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:30,007
We weren't thinking clearly...

1442
01:13:30,102 --> 01:13:32,261
because you told us
we were losing our jobs.

1443
01:13:32,355 --> 01:13:34,644
Now look at us, we're worried
about going in a prison.

1444
01:13:34,733 --> 01:13:36,938
Don't worry about it.
I'll think of something.

1445
01:13:38,653 --> 01:13:40,692
I'm going home.

1446
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:41,943
Me, too.

1447
01:13:43,616 --> 01:13:47,780
You are a very...
Bad person, Peter.

1448
01:14:08,016 --> 01:14:09,392
Lawrence, you awake?

1449
01:14:09,477 --> 01:14:10,721
Yeah.

1450
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:13,677
You wanna come over?

1451
01:14:13,772 --> 01:14:14,852
No, thanks, man.

1452
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:17,147
I don't want you
fucking up my life, too.

1453
01:14:22,698 --> 01:14:25,568
In light of the senselessness
of these heinous crimes...

1454
01:14:25,658 --> 01:14:28,067
that you have committed
against Initech...

1455
01:14:28,162 --> 01:14:31,163
I hereby sentence you,
Michael Bolton...

1456
01:14:31,248 --> 01:14:36,076
and Samir Naan... Nanadajibad...

1457
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:38,412
to a term of no less
than four years...

1458
01:14:38,506 --> 01:14:42,088
in a federal
"pound me in the ass" prison.

1459
01:14:45,930 --> 01:14:47,721
Peter Gibbons...

1460
01:14:47,807 --> 01:14:50,558
you've led a trite
and meaningless life...

1461
01:14:52,312 --> 01:14:55,228
and you're a very bad person.

1462
01:15:32,478 --> 01:15:33,641
Hey.

1463
01:15:35,064 --> 01:15:37,602
You're not working
at Chotchkie's anymore, huh?

1464
01:15:37,691 --> 01:15:39,850
No, no. I got fired.

1465
01:15:40,653 --> 01:15:43,108
- What happened?
- I flipped off my boss.

1466
01:15:43,197 --> 01:15:45,273
Some customers...

1467
01:15:45,366 --> 01:15:47,110
Actually, a line cook...

1468
01:15:47,201 --> 01:15:49,194
but he just happened
to be standing there, so...

1469
01:15:50,496 --> 01:15:52,572
I might be going away
for a while.

1470
01:15:52,665 --> 01:15:56,081
Uh... to jail.

1471
01:15:56,169 --> 01:15:58,078
You were right
about that computer scam.

1472
01:15:58,171 --> 01:15:59,499
That was a bad idea.

1473
01:15:59,588 --> 01:16:02,163
I'm gonna take the blame for it,
I decided.

1474
01:16:03,343 --> 01:16:05,584
I'm on my way now
to return the money...

1475
01:16:05,678 --> 01:16:08,051
and leave the confession
under Lumbergh's door.

1476
01:16:10,433 --> 01:16:11,678
Joanna, I want to apologise.

1477
01:16:11,768 --> 01:16:14,259
I had no right to get pissed off
at you about Lumbergh.

1478
01:16:14,354 --> 01:16:15,932
Lumbergh is not my problem.

1479
01:16:16,022 --> 01:16:18,062
It wasn't even
the right Lumbergh.

1480
01:16:18,149 --> 01:16:22,017
I don't know why I can't just...
Go to work and be happy...

1481
01:16:22,112 --> 01:16:24,520
like I'm supposed to,
like everybody else.

1482
01:16:24,615 --> 01:16:26,773
Peter, most people
don't like their jobs.

1483
01:16:26,867 --> 01:16:30,817
But you go out there and find
something that makes you happy.

1484
01:16:30,913 --> 01:16:32,786
Yeah. Well...

1485
01:16:34,457 --> 01:16:36,498
I may never be happy
at my job...

1486
01:16:36,585 --> 01:16:39,455
but I think that if
I could be with you...

1487
01:16:39,546 --> 01:16:41,539
that I could be happy
with my life.

1488
01:16:41,632 --> 01:16:43,624
I've been a real asshole.

1489
01:16:43,717 --> 01:16:46,802
But, if you'd give it
another shot, I promise...

1490
01:16:46,887 --> 01:16:48,131
OK, shut up.

1491
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:55,311
Whoa! Hey, what's going on here?

1492
01:16:55,396 --> 01:16:57,887
Get a room, you two! Ha ha!

1493
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,436
I hate that guy.

1494
01:17:54,373 --> 01:17:56,449
Then Mr. Lumbergh
told me to talk to payroll...

1495
01:17:56,542 --> 01:17:59,115
and then payroll told me
to talk to Mr. Lumbergh.

1496
01:17:59,211 --> 01:18:01,784
And I still haven't received
my paycheque.

1497
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:04,550
And he took my stapler,
and he never brought it back.

1498
01:18:04,633 --> 01:18:06,958
And then they moved my desk
to storage room "B."

1499
01:18:07,052 --> 01:18:08,880
And there was
garbage on it, and...

1500
01:18:08,971 --> 01:18:11,462
Why don't you go back down
and sit at your desk?

1501
01:18:11,556 --> 01:18:13,016
Mr. Lumbergh
should be here any minute.

1502
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:16,304
- Mr. Lumbergh...
- Just go sit at your desk.

1503
01:18:16,396 --> 01:18:18,851
OK. But, l... I'm gonna just...

1504
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:28,358
I have to take
my stapler back...

1505
01:18:28,449 --> 01:18:32,149
because I told him
it's my stapler.

1506
01:18:37,041 --> 01:18:38,868
It's my stapler.

1507
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:42,709
A Swingline, the brand
I've been using for a long time.

1508
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:03,229
Lawrence, you in there?

1509
01:19:05,071 --> 01:19:07,109
Whoa. Hey, Peter, man.

1510
01:19:07,197 --> 01:19:08,857
Hey.

1511
01:19:08,949 --> 01:19:11,155
So, I might be going away
for a while.

1512
01:19:11,243 --> 01:19:13,153
Yeah, I know, man.

1513
01:19:13,246 --> 01:19:15,736
It's a bummer, dude.
What can I say?

1514
01:19:15,831 --> 01:19:17,871
Yeah. Yeah.

1515
01:19:19,544 --> 01:19:23,043
Well, time to go face the music.

1516
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:25,704
You take care of yourself
if I don't see you, all right?

1517
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,290
You too, man.
Take her easy, bud.

1518
01:19:28,385 --> 01:19:29,845
All right.

1519
01:19:30,971 --> 01:19:32,347
Hey, Peter.

1520
01:19:32,432 --> 01:19:34,092
Yeah?

1521
01:19:35,225 --> 01:19:36,886
Watch out for your cornhole,
bud.

1522
01:19:38,396 --> 01:19:39,807
OK, Lawrence.

1523
01:19:53,537 --> 01:19:56,027
Stay clear, now.
Stay clear.

1524
01:19:56,122 --> 01:19:58,281
Holy shit.

1525
01:21:07,779 --> 01:21:10,531
Wait a minute.
Let me take a look at that.

1526
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:12,742
You don't want that, Peter, man.

1527
01:21:12,827 --> 01:21:14,200
That's toasted, man.

1528
01:21:14,285 --> 01:21:17,489
I think I know someone
who might want this.

1529
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:29,963
Hey, man.

1530
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:33,012
Wanna go to lunch?

1531
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:35,044
Brought mine in a pail...

1532
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:37,714
plus Joanna's supposed
to come by a little later.

1533
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:41,136
How do you like your new job?

1534
01:21:41,231 --> 01:21:43,139
Not too bad, not too bad.

1535
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:44,809
How's Penetrode?

1536
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,525
Initrode.

1537
01:21:46,611 --> 01:21:47,892
They're all right.

1538
01:21:47,988 --> 01:21:49,315
It's work.

1539
01:21:49,404 --> 01:21:51,065
Yeah, yeah.

1540
01:21:51,157 --> 01:21:52,817
Probably get you a job there.

1541
01:21:52,909 --> 01:21:54,700
No, thanks. I, uh...

1542
01:21:54,786 --> 01:21:56,196
I'm doing good here.

1543
01:21:58,039 --> 01:22:01,872
So, uh...
We're gonna be OK, right?

1544
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,786
Yeah.

1545
01:22:04,712 --> 01:22:07,168
I think the fire pretty much
took care of everything.

1546
01:22:07,257 --> 01:22:09,829
I wonder if the money burn up.

1547
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:11,171
It would be shame.

1548
01:22:11,261 --> 01:22:12,636
Yeah.

1549
01:22:12,721 --> 01:22:15,592
So you sure you don't
want us to get you a job?

1550
01:22:15,682 --> 01:22:18,967
That's one thing
I'm definitely sure of.

1551
01:22:21,146 --> 01:22:23,020
All right, chief.

1552
01:22:23,106 --> 01:22:24,351
You guys take care, all right?

1553
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:25,816
All right.

1554
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:27,939
Stay in touch, man.

1555
01:22:28,028 --> 01:22:29,772
OK. Will do.

1556
01:22:33,992 --> 01:22:35,902
This isn't so bad, huh?

1557
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:42,038
Making bucks, getting exercise,
working outside.

1558
01:22:42,126 --> 01:22:43,917
Fuckin' "A."

1559
01:22:46,547 --> 01:22:48,290
Fuckin' "A."

1560
01:23:06,776 --> 01:23:08,982
Excuse me. Excuse me, señor.

1561
01:23:09,070 --> 01:23:10,944
May I speak to you, please?

1562
01:23:11,031 --> 01:23:13,603
I asked for a mai tai,
and they brought a piña colada.

1563
01:23:13,699 --> 01:23:15,989
And I said no salt, no salt...

1564
01:23:16,077 --> 01:23:17,785
for the margarita,
but it had salt on it.

1565
01:23:17,870 --> 01:23:20,444
Lo siento mucho, señor.
Pinche gringo.

1566
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:24,123
I won't be leaving a tip,
'cause I could...

1567
01:23:24,210 --> 01:23:26,038
I could shut
this whole resort down.

1568
01:23:26,130 --> 01:23:27,670
Sir?

1569
01:23:27,755 --> 01:23:32,216
I'll take my traveller's cheques
to a competing resort.

1570
01:23:34,138 --> 01:23:36,628
I could write a letter
to your board of tourism.

1571
01:23:36,723 --> 01:23:38,965
I could have this place
condemned.

1572
01:23:39,059 --> 01:23:43,804
I could put, I could put
strychnine in the guacamole.

1573
01:23:43,897 --> 01:23:46,436
There was salt on the glass,
big grains of salt.

1574
01:24:01,373 --> 01:24:03,330
Give a ride
on the old bone roller coaster.

1575
01:24:03,417 --> 01:24:05,457
Aaaah!

1576
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:21,684
Don't come back
in a dress, man.

1577
01:24:21,769 --> 01:24:23,975
Ha ha ha. You big fag.

1578
01:24:46,711 --> 01:24:47,956
I'm working
at Hooters now, you know...

1579
01:24:48,046 --> 01:24:50,040
and it's very cool.
