1
00:00:45,102 --> 00:00:50,148
Attention, Mr. Hayes,
your wife is waiting at the station.

2
00:00:50,605 --> 00:00:54,064
Oh, it was after -- You know,
after last year's corporate ...

3
00:00:54,277 --> 00:00:56,659
my wife was always
encouraging me, you know?

4
00:00:56,821 --> 00:01:00,243
She said, "No, you did fine
in the corporate." I was a bit nervous.

5
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,492
This little guy. Hello? Sorry.

6
00:01:02,705 --> 00:01:03,871
- That's nice, eh?
- Yeah.

7
00:01:04,037 --> 00:01:05,666
Nice background with the people.

8
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:09,959
- We are here at -- Must I look in there?
- Look into the lens.

9
00:01:10,127 --> 00:01:13,963
We are here at MNU head office,
"Department of Alien Affairs".

10
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:16,216
My name is Wikus van de Merwe.

11
00:01:16,383 --> 00:01:19,844
And behind me you can see
other Alien Affairs workers.

12
00:01:20,054 --> 00:01:22,972
And what we do here
at this department is ...

13
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:27,560
we try to engage with the prawn
on behalf of MNU ...

14
00:01:27,728 --> 00:01:30,355
and on behalf of humans.

15
00:01:31,982 --> 00:01:34,692
To everyone's surprise,
the ship didn't come to a stop ...

16
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,738
over Manhattan or Washington
or Chicago ...

17
00:01:38,906 --> 00:01:44,118
but instead coasted to a halt
directly over the city of Johannesburg.

18
00:01:47,998 --> 00:01:50,500
The doors didn't open for months.
Nobody could get in.

19
00:01:50,668 --> 00:01:54,420
They eventually decided, after much
deliberation, that the best thing to do ...

20
00:01:54,588 --> 00:01:57,215
would be to physically
cut their way in.

21
00:02:01,303 --> 00:02:04,013
We're gonna need a drill down here.

22
00:02:04,598 --> 00:02:09,269
We were on the verge of first contact.

23
00:02:09,478 --> 00:02:11,187
The whole world was watching.

24
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:12,522
We need some more light.

25
00:02:14,316 --> 00:02:17,652
Expecting, I don't know, music
from heaven and bright shining lights.

26
00:02:17,862 --> 00:02:19,946
Got a lot of moisture in here.

27
00:02:20,865 --> 00:02:22,448
Yeah, just go slowly.

28
00:02:23,158 --> 00:02:25,618
Oh, my God.

29
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:36,337
The creatures
were extremely malnourished.

30
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:39,883
They were very unhealthy.
They seemed to be aimless.

31
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:43,094
There was a lot of international
pressure on us at the time.

32
00:02:43,262 --> 00:02:45,138
The world was looking
at Johannesburg ...

33
00:02:45,306 --> 00:02:47,432
so we had to do the right thing.

34
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,851
The government then established
an aid group ...

35
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:53,897
that started to ferry the aliens to
a temporary camp that was set up ...

36
00:02:54,106 --> 00:02:55,982
just beneath the ship.

37
00:02:56,734 --> 00:02:58,860
We didn't have a plan.

38
00:02:59,028 --> 00:03:00,778
There was a million of them.

39
00:03:01,405 --> 00:03:04,198
So, what was
a temporary holding zone ...

40
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:07,035
soon became fenced,
became militarized.

41
00:03:07,202 --> 00:03:09,495
And before we knew it, it was a slum.

42
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:13,333
Well, the truth is nobody really knew
what this place was.

43
00:03:14,752 --> 00:03:16,961
There's a lot of secrets in District 9.

44
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:30,600
At first, a lot of attention was given
to giving the aliens ...

45
00:03:30,768 --> 00:03:32,602
proper status and protection.

46
00:03:33,437 --> 00:03:35,897
They're spending so much money
to keep them here ...

47
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:40,234
when they could be spending it
on other things. But at least --

48
00:03:40,444 --> 00:03:43,321
At least they're
keeping them separate from us.

49
00:03:47,451 --> 00:03:49,243
I wanna be realistic with everyone.

50
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:54,082
- The aliens will not be able to go home.
- The aliens are here to stay.

51
00:03:55,376 --> 00:03:58,002
There were literally thousands
of theories as to why ...

52
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,046
the ship seemed inoperable.

53
00:04:00,255 --> 00:04:03,841
And what was speculated was that a
command module had detached itself ...

54
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:07,553
from the main ship and then
somehow mysteriously become lost.

55
00:04:07,763 --> 00:04:11,099
Did it fall by itself
or was it programmed?

56
00:04:12,184 --> 00:04:13,226
I don't know.

57
00:04:13,435 --> 00:04:15,937
Examination of the old
video footage ...

58
00:04:16,105 --> 00:04:20,566
shows very clearly
that a piece falls from the ship.

59
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,866
We looked everywhere. There's pieces
falling off that vessel for months.

60
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:31,077
More energy weapon caches found.

61
00:04:31,245 --> 00:04:34,080
The special task force
conducted raids in District 9 ...

62
00:04:34,248 --> 00:04:37,709
Where there's a weapon, there's crime.
Tensions rose and rose.

63
00:04:37,876 --> 00:04:41,295
People became more and more fed up,
and eventually the rioting started.

64
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:45,049
Residents in Tembisa rioted
for the third consecutive night ...

65
00:04:45,217 --> 00:04:48,219
in an attempt to remove
all the aliens from their township.

66
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,645
I think they must fix that ship
and they must go.

67
00:04:57,813 --> 00:05:00,273
A virus, a selective virus.

68
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:02,108
Release it near the aliens.

69
00:05:02,317 --> 00:05:05,403
They must just go. I don't know where,
but they must just go!

70
00:05:05,612 --> 00:05:07,530
If they were from another country,
we might understand ...

71
00:05:07,698 --> 00:05:09,657
but they are not even
from this planet at all.

72
00:05:09,825 --> 00:05:12,326
The government have enforced
a nationwide curfew.

73
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:15,913
These aliens -- Prawns.
-- they take my wife away.

74
00:05:16,123 --> 00:05:17,999
The derogatory term "prawn" is used.

75
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:20,960
Obviously, it implies something
that is a bottom feeder ...

76
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,713
that scavenges the leftovers.

77
00:05:25,132 --> 00:05:28,259
You can't say they don't look
like that. They look like prawns.

78
00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:31,471
Aliens made off
with an undisclosed amount of cash.

79
00:05:31,638 --> 00:05:33,097
One bystander was hurt.

80
00:05:33,307 --> 00:05:36,434
What for an alien might be seen as
something recreational ...

81
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:39,812
setting fire to a truck,
derailing a train ...

82
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,565
is for us, obviously,
an extremely destructive act.

83
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,861
They can take the sneakers
you are wearing off you.

84
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:49,781
They check the brand and take them.
They take whatever you have on you.

85
00:05:49,948 --> 00:05:52,408
Your cell phone or anything.

86
00:05:52,576 --> 00:05:53,826
After that, they kill you.

87
00:05:55,329 --> 00:05:58,039
After 20 years, public pressure
forced the government ...

88
00:05:58,248 --> 00:06:01,250
to ship the aliens
out of Johannesburg.

89
00:06:02,127 --> 00:06:05,129
They had had enough, and they
wanted District 9 to be moved ...

90
00:06:05,297 --> 00:06:07,548
and more intensively policed
and controlled.

91
00:06:09,218 --> 00:06:11,886
To enforce eviction, the government
turned to Multi-National United.

92
00:06:12,054 --> 00:06:13,930
Welcome all,
and thank you for coming.

93
00:06:14,098 --> 00:06:17,058
Please listen very closely
to this briefing.

94
00:06:17,226 --> 00:06:21,771
Today we start a very complex
and delicate operation.

95
00:06:23,023 --> 00:06:26,859
This is the largest operation that MNU
has ever undertaken ...

96
00:06:27,027 --> 00:06:31,114
and we believe that it is going
to be undertaken successfully.

97
00:06:31,323 --> 00:06:34,283
It is to move 1.8 million prawns ...

98
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:40,039
from their present home in District 9
to a safer and better location ...

99
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:43,793
200 kilometers outside
of Johannesburg city.

100
00:06:44,002 --> 00:06:46,671
We've built a nice, new facility
where the prawn can go.

101
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,798
He can be comfortable.
He can stay there.

102
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:53,886
The people of Johannesburg
and of South Africa are going to live ...

103
00:06:54,054 --> 00:06:58,182
happily and safely, knowing
that that prawn is very far away.

104
00:06:58,392 --> 00:07:04,230
UIO protocol dictates that
we give the aliens 24-hours' notice ...

105
00:07:04,398 --> 00:07:06,065
of our right to evict.

106
00:07:06,275 --> 00:07:09,193
Today, you will serve these notices ...

107
00:07:09,403 --> 00:07:12,238
getting the aliens
to sign the I-27 form.

108
00:07:12,406 --> 00:07:16,659
The legality that MNU is using to evict
the aliens is simply a whitewash.

109
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:22,123
So I'm going to appoint a field officer
to take direct command.

110
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,458
Wikus van de Merwe.

111
00:07:24,626 --> 00:07:27,503
Everybody always said that Wikus
was not a very smart boy ...

112
00:07:27,671 --> 00:07:29,463
but he was a wonderful son.

113
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:32,925
That was my Wikus. Just --

114
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,307
Yes. Like up on the big stage.
Thank you, Piet. Mr. Smit.

115
00:07:39,474 --> 00:07:44,061
I had to put aside the fact that
my daughter was married to Wikus.

116
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,857
That didn't factor in my decision.

117
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:52,528
It's almost as big as my wedding day.
You know, not as big.

118
00:07:53,947 --> 00:07:55,615
Wikus was always making me things.

119
00:07:55,782 --> 00:07:58,451
He said that way, they just mean
so much more.

120
00:07:58,619 --> 00:08:01,704
He left this papier-mâché ball
on the sofa one day ...

121
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:05,124
and I didn't see it
and I sat down and I --

122
00:08:05,292 --> 00:08:06,459
I kind of squished it.

123
00:08:06,627 --> 00:08:09,879
They took all his stuff away
for the investigation ...

124
00:08:10,047 --> 00:08:12,590
and I made them bring it all back.

125
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:15,927
- Congratulations, man.
- Oh, thanks, man.

126
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:18,512
- Okay, you're gonna go to P-7.
- Wikus. Wikus.

127
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,391
Leslie. How's it going, man?
There's the shake. P-9 for you.

128
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:24,477
I'm not saying what he did was right.

129
00:08:25,854 --> 00:08:27,480
He took the choices that were given.

130
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:30,691
This is Trent. Fundiswa, Trent.
Trent, Fundiswa.

131
00:08:30,859 --> 00:08:33,194
- Hi.
- Fundiswa's the guy I've selected ...

132
00:08:33,362 --> 00:08:35,613
to replace me.
If he can make it today, eh?

133
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,406
- I'll make it.
- You think you can?

134
00:08:37,574 --> 00:08:39,617
I just want everyone watching this ...

135
00:08:40,994 --> 00:08:42,662
to learn from what has happened.

136
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,291
You would think things like this
happen to somebody else, not me.

137
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,627
Guys, don't forget to pack
the stun grenades.

138
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,505
Tovi. There's Tovi.
How's it going, man? A long time, eh?

139
00:08:52,673 --> 00:08:54,632
- You got my stuff?
- Hey, big boss.

140
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,384
- How's it going?
- I'm all right.

141
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:58,719
This is Fundiswa.
He's training with us today.

142
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:01,973
I think I was --
"Disgusted" would be the word.

143
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:06,686
There was always a hint of something
not kosher with van de Merwe.

144
00:09:08,063 --> 00:09:11,357
Nobody saw it coming. None of us
had any idea of what he was doing.

145
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:15,945
I think it's a great thing that it's not
the military guys in charge this time.

146
00:09:16,113 --> 00:09:19,782
Not to say Koobus and the cowboys
are not wanted. You're always wanted.

147
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:22,368
You see now? These are the cowboys.

148
00:09:23,203 --> 00:09:24,787
- Get out!
- Fire!

149
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,290
They shoot first
and then answer the questions.

150
00:09:27,457 --> 00:09:29,166
You can see -- Hey, sorry, sorry.

151
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:31,669
That's above the allocated amount
of ammunition.

152
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:33,879
Your pouches are full,
but you still carry.

153
00:09:34,047 --> 00:09:35,965
Maybe you should speak
to the colonel.

154
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:37,800
I just think that you should --

155
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:41,095
FNG over here says that we got
too much ammunition.

156
00:09:41,305 --> 00:09:44,557
All I'm saying, Koobus, is that,
you know, you should find ways ...

157
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:47,351
of making your guys more efficient,
you know?

158
00:09:47,561 --> 00:09:51,147
Listen to me, you fuck! Get that
fucking camera out of my face.

159
00:09:51,356 --> 00:09:52,440
Fucking doos.

160
00:09:53,817 --> 00:09:56,193
There are rules.
We're all living by rules.

161
00:09:57,571 --> 00:10:00,948
I don't think he can be forgiven.
It was like a betrayal.

162
00:10:01,158 --> 00:10:05,077
I've gotta get going, guys. I think we're
gonna have to cut this. We're gonna go.

163
00:10:05,245 --> 00:10:06,912
This is tangled. This is tangled.

164
00:10:07,122 --> 00:10:10,082
- Move it, move it.
- Come on, let's go.

165
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,668
- Hurry up. Go on. Go on.
- Go, go, go.

166
00:10:13,503 --> 00:10:17,006
We've got four teams in the air
and three teams on the ground.

167
00:10:19,926 --> 00:10:23,512
Got a visual on the ground crew.
We can take it into position.

168
00:10:24,097 --> 00:10:25,848
Copy that.

169
00:10:29,978 --> 00:10:34,065
These are full. Check your magazines,
people. Come on. Let's go.

170
00:10:34,274 --> 00:10:38,402
The prawn doesn't really understand
the concept of ownership of property.

171
00:10:38,612 --> 00:10:42,823
So we have to come there and say,
"Listen, this is our land.

172
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:44,700
Please will you go?"

173
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:51,207
It's difficult to put the vest on
by yourself.

174
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:54,543
- Thomas, can you help me?
- They told me I was going to get a vest.

175
00:10:54,711 --> 00:10:57,963
Just look -- Thomas, just look
on the side if there's a vest there.

176
00:10:58,173 --> 00:11:01,550
- I'm concerned about my family.
- Look, don't worry. It'll be fine.

177
00:11:01,718 --> 00:11:03,969
Rights groups have demanded
that mercenaries ...

178
00:11:04,137 --> 00:11:07,473
should comply
with all UIO regulations in District 9.

179
00:11:08,975 --> 00:11:11,727
We're coming to you from
the entrance of District 9 ...

180
00:11:12,145 --> 00:11:15,648
as today Multi-National United
sets out to relocate ...

181
00:11:15,816 --> 00:11:20,111
approximately 1.8 million
alien residents from their homes.

182
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,489
Human-rights groups are keeping
a watchful eye, as many suspect ...

183
00:11:23,657 --> 00:11:24,907
abuses might occur.

184
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:45,428
We're seeing heavily armed
private security forces ...

185
00:11:45,595 --> 00:11:51,308
being deployed into District 9,
backed up by significant air support.

186
00:12:00,944 --> 00:12:03,946
We go shack to shack
and get them to sign the form.

187
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:07,074
First one, E-X-triple-seven.

188
00:12:07,284 --> 00:12:10,661
We're seeing the convoy stop
and the operation is about to begin.

189
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,375
- Arriving at destination.
- Just stay focused.

190
00:12:16,543 --> 00:12:18,669
- You ready, Thomas?
- Yeah.

191
00:12:19,671 --> 00:12:21,547
- Okay. Yeah, that's it.
- Here we go.

192
00:12:21,715 --> 00:12:23,257
- Ready, boss?
- That's the signal.

193
00:12:23,425 --> 00:12:25,634
Doors will now open.
Please mind the step.

194
00:12:25,802 --> 00:12:28,929
- You stay behind us. Good luck, boy.
- Sure, sure.

195
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:32,308
- No, no. Don't split up.
- Shit!

196
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:36,228
- Thomas.
- We've got the bastard.

197
00:12:36,438 --> 00:12:39,440
Stay, stay, stay. Stay low.
Where is he going? What is he --?

198
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:40,816
Okay, Thomas, move away.

199
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,985
It's clear that security is very high ...

200
00:12:43,153 --> 00:12:45,821
and it's only the beginning
of a total clampdown.

201
00:12:50,494 --> 00:12:52,161
We are here to assist you.

202
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:54,830
Move out. Let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

203
00:12:54,998 --> 00:12:57,082
Let's go. Move out. Let's go!

204
00:12:57,584 --> 00:12:58,667
This is MNU agents.

205
00:12:58,835 --> 00:13:01,879
- Open the door, please.
- Open up, open up. MNU are here.

206
00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:04,548
- MNU.
- Always hold your badge up.

207
00:13:04,716 --> 00:13:07,801
Hello. Hello. Hello.

208
00:13:07,969 --> 00:13:10,679
Okay. This is Wikus van de Merwe
from MNU.

209
00:13:10,847 --> 00:13:13,057
We are here to serve you
an eviction notice.

210
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:14,433
You just put your scrawl there.

211
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:16,018
Fuck off!

212
00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:18,437
Okay, all right. Thomas, hold it.

213
00:13:18,647 --> 00:13:20,397
We've got the scrawl. As he hit it --

214
00:13:20,565 --> 00:13:23,943
That's what I was saying,
it counts as a scrawl.

215
00:13:25,487 --> 00:13:29,573
First time you come in, there'll always
be a little bit of tension between us --

216
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:32,284
Hey! Hey, food sack,
you can't eat that, man.

217
00:13:32,452 --> 00:13:35,037
The prawn likes to eat the rubber.
Like a marshmallow.

218
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:37,915
No, no, no! Don't prod him.
Don't prod him like that.

219
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,084
Don't prod him.

220
00:13:41,127 --> 00:13:42,211
Fuck.

221
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:44,088
You see that. Breaking the rules.

222
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:45,756
No, stay calm.

223
00:13:47,842 --> 00:13:51,095
Okay, this is gonna be problems.
All the prawns are coming out.

224
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:54,515
They wanna see what's going on.
No, hey. Stop it! Stop it!

225
00:13:54,683 --> 00:13:55,724
Horace, bring my goed.

226
00:13:55,892 --> 00:13:57,977
See? Everybody's gathering now.
Don't shoot.

227
00:13:58,144 --> 00:14:01,146
- You're gonna turn it into a war zone.
- What is that? Tear gas?

228
00:14:01,314 --> 00:14:03,399
- Is that tear gas?
- No, it's cat food.

229
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:05,901
It's cat food. I just distract them.

230
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:09,196
Yeah, yeah. He got a bit close,
he was prodding a prawn and he --

231
00:14:09,364 --> 00:14:11,115
He's lost his arm.

232
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:14,159
So we need a team down here
straightaway, please, man.

233
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:18,455
No, it's not my house.
I don't live here.

234
00:14:18,665 --> 00:14:21,166
That's a pity, because you know this --

235
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:23,794
Hell, this is a nice cat food,
you know?

236
00:14:24,004 --> 00:14:26,797
But it's not your house,
so we'll give it to someone else.

237
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:28,007
Yes! It is my house!

238
00:14:28,174 --> 00:14:30,426
We need you to sign there.
Okay, there it is.

239
00:14:30,594 --> 00:14:34,638
Now you can take that. Okay, all right.
Thomas. Thomas, wait. Take it easy.

240
00:14:34,806 --> 00:14:37,808
The creatures became incredibly
obsessed with cat food.

241
00:14:38,018 --> 00:14:41,645
Something about that. It was like
catnip for cats, only a lot more intense.

242
00:14:41,813 --> 00:14:44,106
Get down on the ground or I'll shoot.

243
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,692
Come on. Come on.
That's it. Come on.

244
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:48,277
MNU are your friends.

245
00:14:49,654 --> 00:14:52,239
Hello? MNU. We are here
to serve eviction notices.

246
00:14:52,407 --> 00:14:54,366
What is eviction?

247
00:14:54,534 --> 00:14:55,618
Hold it, boys.

248
00:14:55,785 --> 00:15:00,372
What we have stranded on Earth in
this colony, is basically the workers.

249
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,793
Don't think for themselves,
take commands, have no initiative.

250
00:15:04,961 --> 00:15:08,380
They've lost all of their leadership
through, we presume, illness.

251
00:15:09,633 --> 00:15:12,009
- We are here for you.
- Keep your fucking hands up.

252
00:15:13,887 --> 00:15:16,847
-- holding stable in
the Nigerian compound area.

253
00:15:26,858 --> 00:15:29,026
Where there's a slum, there's crime ...

254
00:15:29,653 --> 00:15:31,612
and District 9 was no exception.

255
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:34,073
The Nigerians had
various scams going.

256
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,450
One of them was the cat-food scam ...

257
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,245
where they sold cat food
to the aliens for exorbitant prices.

258
00:15:40,455 --> 00:15:42,373
You put the money here first.

259
00:15:42,582 --> 00:15:45,084
You don't get anything until you pay.

260
00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:50,255
What are you trying to do?
I'll chop your balls off.

261
00:15:50,465 --> 00:15:53,175
Not to mention
interspecies prostitution.

262
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:56,053
And they also dealt
in alien weaponry.

263
00:15:56,262 --> 00:15:58,764
You have a car hijacking,
there's a chop shop there.

264
00:15:58,932 --> 00:16:00,974
See that?
That's somebody's car in there.

265
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:05,354
The Nigerians in District 9 are headed
by a man called Obesandjo.

266
00:16:05,563 --> 00:16:09,316
He's a very powerful
underground figure in Johannesburg.

267
00:16:09,526 --> 00:16:12,277
Don't play with these boys.
He'll cut you in four pieces.

268
00:16:12,445 --> 00:16:14,780
- He will put you on each side of --
- Boss. Boss.

269
00:16:14,948 --> 00:16:18,742
That's the boss there. Okay,
no problems. No. Keep walking.

270
00:16:18,952 --> 00:16:23,122
Don't look at him. That's gonna cause
problems. Trent, don't film here now.

271
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:25,499
Double up, baby, double up.

272
00:16:26,042 --> 00:16:29,420
- All right, next, 766. All right.
- Now, this is the one.

273
00:16:30,213 --> 00:16:33,382
- MNU agents. Open the door, please.
- Hey, hey.

274
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,134
- What?
- Jesus.

275
00:16:35,343 --> 00:16:37,594
- Thomas. Check around the side.
- What is it?

276
00:16:37,804 --> 00:16:40,472
Check around the side there.
That's a --

277
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,309
Control, it's Wikus van de Merwe.
I need a population-control team ...

278
00:16:44,477 --> 00:16:48,689
at JV-766, Zone 4 immediately,
please. Check that side, Thomas.

279
00:16:48,898 --> 00:16:51,942
- There's 40 to 50 eggs in here.
- Is this normal?

280
00:16:52,152 --> 00:16:54,236
- This is an amazing find.
- They're all gone.

281
00:16:54,404 --> 00:16:56,572
I can just show you a little bit
how it works.

282
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,533
Basically, a cow is hung
from the ceiling, you can see.

283
00:16:59,701 --> 00:17:03,912
Very little of it left, of course, because
all these pipes supply the nutrition ...

284
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,415
to the little prawn eggs.

285
00:17:06,624 --> 00:17:08,709
- You can do one, if you want.
- No, I'm fine.

286
00:17:08,877 --> 00:17:12,421
You want to see? There you go. Okay.
No more nutrition to the guy.

287
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:15,632
- And then, finally, we take out that.
- Oh, God.

288
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,844
The little guy has gone
to a nice little sleep now.

289
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:22,681
Just pop him out. There we go.
And pop him out here.

290
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:26,268
You can take that. Keep it
as a souvenir for your first abortion.

291
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,604
- You can feel like you did one.
- Yes, boss.

292
00:17:28,772 --> 00:17:30,272
Where's the team now?

293
00:17:31,274 --> 00:17:33,901
Okay, here he comes, guys.

294
00:17:34,068 --> 00:17:35,360
This is The Snake.

295
00:17:36,112 --> 00:17:39,573
To go in and abort each egg one
at a time would take a very long time.

296
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:41,867
So this makes a lot of sense.

297
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:46,079
Do you hear that? That's a popping
sound that you're hearing.

298
00:17:46,247 --> 00:17:51,001
It's almost like a popcorn.
What the egg does is, it pops up.

299
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:54,213
The little guy, what's left of him,
pops out there.

300
00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:57,299
So that's the sound
that you are hearing with the popping.

301
00:17:57,467 --> 00:18:01,011
You don't need that, man. Only sissies
wear that. You don't need that.

302
00:18:01,221 --> 00:18:04,848
- You've been drinking a little bit, eh?
- Watch the suit, man.

303
00:18:05,058 --> 00:18:07,643
What are you doing
with these television sets here?

304
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:09,019
What's this?

305
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,480
Hey. Smile for the cameras there, eh?

306
00:18:11,648 --> 00:18:14,066
- That's a first-day find.
- That's a big find.

307
00:18:14,275 --> 00:18:17,069
You see this? Look at this.
Trent. Trent, look at this.

308
00:18:17,237 --> 00:18:18,779
There's weapons all over here.

309
00:18:18,947 --> 00:18:21,448
TK-57572.

310
00:18:21,658 --> 00:18:28,205
Some of the guns are small.
But if it shoot you, it make a big mess.

311
00:18:32,752 --> 00:18:36,296
MNU is trying to move the aliens
for humanitarian reasons ...

312
00:18:36,506 --> 00:18:40,592
but the real focus, just as it has been
right from the beginning, is weapons.

313
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:45,764
MNU is the second-largest weapons
manufacturer in the world.

314
00:18:45,974 --> 00:18:48,767
We assumed that we'd be able
to pick up the alien gun ...

315
00:18:48,935 --> 00:18:51,436
and be able to shoot it.
It didn't work like that.

316
00:18:51,646 --> 00:18:55,482
As we discovered, their technology is
engineered in a biological manner ...

317
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,734
and interacts exclusively
with their DNA.

318
00:18:57,944 --> 00:19:00,821
So it just doesn't work with humans.
It's as simple as that.

319
00:19:02,866 --> 00:19:05,701
This is basically a guy
and there's three humans here.

320
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:08,036
Basically, trying to make a warning,
you know?

321
00:19:08,204 --> 00:19:11,748
He's saying, "I killed three humans.
Watch out for me."

322
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:15,252
Hey, don't urinate on your own bloody --
Okay. Back up. Back up.

323
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,546
Back up, back up, back up.
Guys. Thomas.

324
00:19:17,755 --> 00:19:22,009
Control, this is Wikus requesting
First Battalion air support, please.

325
00:19:23,344 --> 00:19:26,889
You want to talk to them or you want
to talk to me? Yeah, you can talk --

326
00:19:27,056 --> 00:19:28,181
No, not them!

327
00:19:30,727 --> 00:19:31,768
No.

328
00:19:34,939 --> 00:19:39,401
Okay, guys, thanks very much.
Yeah, no, he had a spade.

329
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,211
Look! I find some!

330
00:19:58,379 --> 00:19:59,796
I tell you before ...

331
00:19:59,964 --> 00:20:01,924
this is human technology ...

332
00:20:02,091 --> 00:20:03,467
it is useless.

333
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:06,094
Only our technology
contains the fluid.

334
00:20:06,262 --> 00:20:07,971
That is not our technology?

335
00:20:08,306 --> 00:20:09,806
No, it's junk.

336
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,100
Keep looking.

337
00:20:14,854 --> 00:20:16,980
I find something.

338
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:21,276
Yes. This is what we need.

339
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,946
Good, little one.

340
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:29,534
Get down.

341
00:20:39,587 --> 00:20:41,546
Careful. Wait.

342
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:43,715
There.

343
00:20:44,884 --> 00:20:47,260
Why must it take so long?

344
00:20:47,428 --> 00:20:50,347
Because it is very difficult ...

345
00:20:51,557 --> 00:20:54,184
so much can go wrong.

346
00:21:06,572 --> 00:21:08,782
Twenty years of work.

347
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,617
Our plan is ready now?

348
00:21:10,785 --> 00:21:12,953
Quiet. Listen.

349
00:21:14,455 --> 00:21:16,540
They are coming.

350
00:21:16,749 --> 00:21:20,919
To Control, van de Merwe unit.
This is Yankee-Foxtrot-5-3-0.

351
00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:24,089
This is a dangerous area, you know.

352
00:21:24,257 --> 00:21:25,924
You must hide this ...

353
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:28,468
they must not find it.

354
00:21:28,678 --> 00:21:31,054
Answer the door and be polite.

355
00:21:31,514 --> 00:21:33,598
No! You take it.

356
00:21:34,308 --> 00:21:38,603
Okay, now, you see, this is a problem.
This is a gang sign. You see this?

357
00:21:38,771 --> 00:21:41,606
So again, looks like we have a --
Thomas, look sharp, eh?

358
00:21:41,774 --> 00:21:43,525
Looks like we have
more gang members.

359
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:46,236
Fundiswa, you just stay back.
You stay behind Thomas.

360
00:21:46,404 --> 00:21:47,654
This place is swarming with MNU.

361
00:21:47,822 --> 00:21:48,864
Open up!

362
00:21:49,032 --> 00:21:50,115
I will be searched.

363
00:21:50,408 --> 00:21:51,908
I must get back to my son.

364
00:21:52,076 --> 00:21:53,910
Don't make them angry. Be polite!

365
00:21:54,787 --> 00:21:58,331
MNU agents. Open the door, please.
Hello.

366
00:21:58,499 --> 00:21:59,583
Nobody is here.

367
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:02,461
We would like you to please sign --
That's unacceptable.

368
00:22:02,628 --> 00:22:03,712
Move out! Move out!

369
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,715
- That is totally unacceptable!
- Get out, you stupid prawn.

370
00:22:06,883 --> 00:22:09,468
- That's bloody rude. Get outside.
- Come on. Move!

371
00:22:09,635 --> 00:22:11,178
- Move! Move!
- Get outside.

372
00:22:11,345 --> 00:22:13,013
We tried to talk nicely with you.

373
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:17,434
I tried to talk nicely with him, I did.
Get him out to the front there, Thomas.

374
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,352
- Keep moving.
- Cheeky bastard.

375
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,063
You got something in your house?

376
00:22:21,272 --> 00:22:23,023
- All the way, Thomas.
- On your knees.

377
00:22:23,191 --> 00:22:26,276
- I'm gonna have a look.
- Just stay there. Right there.

378
00:22:26,444 --> 00:22:28,904
Sir, we have to serve you
an eviction notice.

379
00:22:29,072 --> 00:22:30,322
Do you understand that?

380
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:31,323
No.

381
00:22:31,491 --> 00:22:34,451
This is a classic kind of
gangster shack. I can tell you ...

382
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,078
we gonna find weapons here.

383
00:22:36,245 --> 00:22:38,830
Trent, watch your head.
Don't hit the cow's head.

384
00:22:38,998 --> 00:22:41,041
Just checking for panels.

385
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:43,752
You hear that?
Yeah, it's hollow there.

386
00:22:45,755 --> 00:22:48,006
See? Look at that. Look at that.

387
00:22:48,841 --> 00:22:50,634
I haven't seen this type of setup.

388
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:54,513
It's almost like
a chemistry type of a set.

389
00:22:55,389 --> 00:22:57,390
There's gonna be something.

390
00:22:59,435 --> 00:23:01,061
What is this kak?

391
00:23:03,189 --> 00:23:04,815
What is this?

392
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,988
I don't know. This has got
the markings there of --

393
00:23:12,156 --> 00:23:14,324
So it's definitely alien.

394
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:18,286
But it's not a weapon.

395
00:23:18,496 --> 00:23:22,124
But I don't trust it.
You know, I don't trust anything that --

396
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:24,251
Are you all right?

397
00:23:24,418 --> 00:23:27,796
- Wikus, are you all right?
- Cut it. Turn it off.

398
00:23:31,968 --> 00:23:34,136
Just switch it off. Turn it off.
Turn it off.

399
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:37,764
You gonna just -- You gonna
cut that part, Trent, out of this?

400
00:23:37,932 --> 00:23:39,307
- Yeah.
- Where it sprays me.

401
00:23:39,475 --> 00:23:40,517
We'll cut that.

402
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:44,354
We just found
a dangerous object here.

403
00:23:44,522 --> 00:23:49,317
It has a fluid in it that I suspect might
leak onto people or cause damage.

404
00:23:49,485 --> 00:23:52,946
So we just check that in and we
take that down nicely to the lab.

405
00:23:53,156 --> 00:23:55,031
It's not a weapon, but it's dangerous.

406
00:23:55,241 --> 00:23:56,908
He's got weapons somewhere here.

407
00:23:57,076 --> 00:24:00,120
My sense is telling me that.
Let's check the other side here.

408
00:24:00,329 --> 00:24:01,454
- Thomas.
- Yes, sir?

409
00:24:01,622 --> 00:24:03,582
- Thomas, keep the gun on him.
- I got him.

410
00:24:03,749 --> 00:24:06,376
Keep the gun on him, Thomas.
There's weapons here.

411
00:24:08,004 --> 00:24:11,298
This is Christmas.
This is Christmas, my friends.

412
00:24:11,507 --> 00:24:13,758
This is the biggest find
that I've ever seen.

413
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:16,178
Control, come in.
This is Wikus van de Merwe ...

414
00:24:16,345 --> 00:24:18,555
requesting First Reaction Battalion ...

415
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:21,892
at Foxtrot-Yankee-5-3-0.

416
00:24:23,311 --> 00:24:26,062
- I'll send them out to you now, sir.
- Stand by, guys.

417
00:24:27,273 --> 00:24:30,650
This I've never seen. Have you seen
this? Amazing. Look at this gun.

418
00:24:30,818 --> 00:24:33,069
- Fuck, man.
- What gun is this?

419
00:24:33,237 --> 00:24:35,572
- This is absolutely amazing.
- Just hold it still.

420
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,116
- What are you doing?
- I wanna show this to Thomas.

421
00:24:38,284 --> 00:24:40,952
- You said we can't handle them.
- I'm just gonna show it.

422
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,581
I'm not gonna use it.
It doesn't even work with humans.

423
00:24:44,874 --> 00:24:49,127
- Thomas, look at this gun.
- Yeah. That's a big one, man.

424
00:24:49,295 --> 00:24:50,128
That's not mine.

425
00:24:50,296 --> 00:24:51,129
You're a dealer?

426
00:24:51,297 --> 00:24:52,255
No.

427
00:24:54,342 --> 00:24:56,218
You hear this?
You see what's happening?

428
00:24:56,385 --> 00:24:58,887
First Battalion, my friend,
you know what that means?

429
00:24:59,055 --> 00:25:01,640
That means your days
of flaunting the law are over.

430
00:25:01,807 --> 00:25:05,143
Have a look there. You see that?
What's that? That's a hiding for you.

431
00:25:05,311 --> 00:25:06,728
That's a hiding.

432
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:09,481
- Hey. Hey.
- Stop that!

433
00:25:09,649 --> 00:25:11,524
- Stand back!
- Hey.

434
00:25:18,491 --> 00:25:20,158
Wikus!

435
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,423
Come here.

436
00:25:35,591 --> 00:25:38,051
- Wikus, are you all right?
- Come here.

437
00:25:38,261 --> 00:25:41,346
Where do you think you're going?
Hey. Come on.

438
00:25:41,514 --> 00:25:42,681
- Are you okay?
- Fuck off!

439
00:25:42,848 --> 00:25:45,267
You don't run away from a chopper.
Where are you going?

440
00:25:45,434 --> 00:25:46,893
No. No.

441
00:25:49,939 --> 00:25:52,274
Skeet off, brother. Skeet off.

442
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:58,530
Koobus to base, come in.

443
00:26:00,074 --> 00:26:01,741
I've got two people down.

444
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:04,286
MNU guard, MNU agent.

445
00:26:05,496 --> 00:26:09,124
It's Foxtrot-Yankee-5-3-0, copy?

446
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:11,167
And we need a medevac ASAP.

447
00:26:11,335 --> 00:26:14,838
No, that's fine, Koobus.
I don't need the medevac.

448
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:18,508
- Wikus, you burned your arm.
- I'll just treat it here, Koobus.

449
00:26:18,676 --> 00:26:21,136
It's not serious. I'll treat it here.

450
00:26:21,554 --> 00:26:23,638
I think you must go to a doctor,
a hospital.

451
00:26:23,806 --> 00:26:25,015
- No.
- Get it checked out.

452
00:26:25,182 --> 00:26:30,061
I'll just have it treated by the medics.
Just help me -- Help me up quick.

453
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:32,814
Did you see how fast
that one was, Trent?

454
00:26:32,982 --> 00:26:34,274
Yeah, he was fast.

455
00:26:34,442 --> 00:26:36,651
Hell, this guy was fast,
I promise you.

456
00:26:44,744 --> 00:26:46,411
Look, I fix it ...

457
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:47,787
l make it work.

458
00:26:47,955 --> 00:26:50,373
I told you not to touch that.

459
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,043
What is wrong?

460
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,463
Nothing.
Go outside and watch for humans.

461
00:26:57,673 --> 00:26:59,549
Where is your friend?

462
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:02,385
He's gone.

463
00:27:14,648 --> 00:27:16,733
- Are you okay?
- Just a bit hot. Are you hot?

464
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:18,234
- Are you hot, Trent?
- Yeah.

465
00:27:18,402 --> 00:27:21,654
Yeah. If you can't stand the heat,
get out of the kitchen.

466
00:27:21,822 --> 00:27:23,698
That's what I -- That's what I say.

467
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:26,201
- They are too dangerous. I understand.
- You see.

468
00:27:26,369 --> 00:27:29,204
Another kid. There's just kids
everywhere. Kids everywhere.

469
00:27:29,372 --> 00:27:32,040
This is what I mean.
This is why we get rid of them.

470
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:34,125
- The little ones.
- That's why we abort.

471
00:27:34,293 --> 00:27:37,170
- Should I shoot the little bastard?
- You can't shoot it now.

472
00:27:37,338 --> 00:27:38,505
It's illegal to do that.

473
00:27:38,672 --> 00:27:40,632
- MNU agent, come out.
- Hello.

474
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,426
Hello, little guy. MNU.
Here's a sweetie for you, okay.

475
00:27:43,594 --> 00:27:45,804
There you go.
Eat your sweetie.

476
00:27:45,971 --> 00:27:48,306
Yeah, he's gonna eat his sweetie.

477
00:27:48,474 --> 00:27:50,767
Works like a charm every time,
you know.

478
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:52,602
- Hey. Hey, come on! Hey!
- Fuck, man.

479
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:56,314
You almost poked my eye out
with a fucking lollipop.

480
00:27:56,482 --> 00:27:58,566
- I tried to be fucking nice to you!
- Hey.

481
00:27:58,734 --> 00:28:01,361
Fuck. Is this
your fucking little runt here?

482
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:02,946
Inside, go!

483
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:04,531
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

484
00:28:04,698 --> 00:28:06,991
You teach him some manners.
Thomas, get him out.

485
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:10,995
Come. Get down!
Had enough of you stupid things.

486
00:28:11,163 --> 00:28:13,248
What do you want?

487
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,291
We're from MNU.

488
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:16,501
I know.

489
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:19,462
We require your scrawl
on this eviction notification.

490
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,423
Why am I being evicted?

491
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,258
Yes, it's eviction notice.

492
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:25,760
Put your scrawl on the bottom.
There's your name?

493
00:28:25,928 --> 00:28:26,970
Yes?

494
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,305
Christopher Johnson.
Put your name at the bottom.

495
00:28:29,473 --> 00:28:31,516
It says you must give me
24 hours notice.

496
00:28:31,684 --> 00:28:34,436
You're going to another place.
A city built for prawns.

497
00:28:34,603 --> 00:28:37,147
And we're not even
going to charge you. Okay?

498
00:28:37,314 --> 00:28:38,356
This isn't legal.

499
00:28:38,524 --> 00:28:39,566
Sign the fucking paper.

500
00:28:39,733 --> 00:28:40,775
No.

501
00:28:40,943 --> 00:28:43,653
You don't have a choice.
You have to sign the document.

502
00:28:43,821 --> 00:28:46,906
This guy's obviously --
He's a little sharper.

503
00:28:47,074 --> 00:28:49,367
You know? So we're gonna
have to try something.

504
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:50,910
Hello.

505
00:28:51,078 --> 00:28:55,248
Okay, seems like we didn't understand
each other there properly, eh?

506
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:59,085
Okay. So you've got a little one, eh?
Do you have a license for that?

507
00:28:59,253 --> 00:29:00,295
Yes.

508
00:29:00,463 --> 00:29:04,549
You see this litter out here? This is
dangerous conditions for your child.

509
00:29:04,717 --> 00:29:08,678
Article 75 says that because your child
is living in dangerous conditions ...

510
00:29:08,846 --> 00:29:12,307
I'm gonna take him to Child Services.
I'll have a chat with your son.

511
00:29:12,475 --> 00:29:14,142
You keep away from my child!

512
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,853
Don't -- Don't point
your fucking tentacles at me.

513
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:18,980
Don't point
your fucking tentacles at me.

514
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:21,691
You want to stay,
your boy is coming down with me ...

515
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:25,945
to Child Services. He's gonna spend
the rest of his life in a 1-by-1 meter box.

516
00:29:26,113 --> 00:29:28,573
- Put the gun on him, Thomas.
- Hello, little guy.

517
00:29:28,741 --> 00:29:31,659
It's the sweetie man coming.

518
00:29:31,827 --> 00:29:35,288
Fuck. Look at this, Trent. Fuck.

519
00:29:35,456 --> 00:29:38,541
Thomas. Thomas, keep the gun
on him, he's definitely a criminal.

520
00:29:38,751 --> 00:29:40,418
He's got a whole
computer shop here.

521
00:29:40,586 --> 00:29:42,212
He's going nowhere, boss.

522
00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:44,339
You know, this is amazing.
I mean, this --

523
00:29:44,507 --> 00:29:47,217
These are obviously, you can see,
stolen computers now ...

524
00:29:47,384 --> 00:29:49,260
that he's decorating his place with.

525
00:29:49,428 --> 00:29:51,846
Definitely doesn't have
a permit for this.

526
00:29:52,348 --> 00:29:55,225
Where is that fucking little runt?

527
00:29:56,936 --> 00:29:59,854
Hello, it's the sweetie man.

528
00:30:00,022 --> 00:30:01,606
Here's a sweetie --

529
00:30:01,774 --> 00:30:03,983
Hey, I've got a s --

530
00:30:05,736 --> 00:30:08,363
- Hey. Wikus.
- Trent, turn it off.

531
00:30:08,572 --> 00:30:11,824
- Turn off the fucking camera, man.
- Wikus, are you okay, boss?

532
00:30:11,992 --> 00:30:13,910
- Are you all right?
- Fuck off. Fuck off!

533
00:30:14,203 --> 00:30:15,537
Shit.

534
00:30:22,795 --> 00:30:24,963
- I said --
- All right, I'll switch it off.

535
00:30:25,714 --> 00:30:27,674
- Shall I leave him?
- Just leave him here.

536
00:30:27,841 --> 00:30:29,092
You're lucky.

537
00:30:29,301 --> 00:30:31,386
We'll come back for you tomorrow,
my friend.

538
00:30:31,554 --> 00:30:34,264
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow,
Christopher Johnson.

539
00:30:34,974 --> 00:30:38,560
When dealing with aliens,
try to be polite but firm.

540
00:30:38,727 --> 00:30:41,563
- A smile is cheaper than a bullet.
- Are you feeling better?

541
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,606
- What?
- How are you feeling?

542
00:30:43,774 --> 00:30:48,403
I'm f -- I'm fine. I'm all right.
I'm just -- I'm a bit dizzy.

543
00:30:48,737 --> 00:30:52,865
Actually, just pull up there on the side.
I just wanna get something to eat here.

544
00:30:59,582 --> 00:31:03,543
Are you sure you should be having
that after your whole puking episode?

545
00:31:03,752 --> 00:31:05,169
I actually feel a lot better.

546
00:31:05,337 --> 00:31:07,171
- I think I needed to cleanse.
- Boss.

547
00:31:08,591 --> 00:31:09,799
Boss.

548
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:12,010
- Boss. Your --
- Wikus, that's -- That's --

549
00:31:12,177 --> 00:31:15,096
Black stuff coming out
of your nose there.

550
00:31:38,912 --> 00:31:42,415
Telephone call for Mr. Clark
on Line 5.

551
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,204
It's a silver cylinder.

552
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:23,289
I can't find it.

553
00:32:23,457 --> 00:32:25,375
We must find it.

554
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:27,794
It contains the fluid.

555
00:32:29,838 --> 00:32:30,880
It's not here.

556
00:32:31,048 --> 00:32:33,716
It has to be, keep looking.

557
00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:53,027
We trade for 10,000 cans.

558
00:32:56,323 --> 00:33:00,702
Certain factions of Nigerian gangs want
to extract weaponry from District 9 ...

559
00:33:00,869 --> 00:33:02,662
and have been trying to for years.

560
00:33:03,372 --> 00:33:05,289
Give them one hundred cans.

561
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:07,917
One hundred.

562
00:33:08,085 --> 00:33:09,877
Yes, yes, but we take all of them now.

563
00:33:10,045 --> 00:33:11,087
All right, boys.

564
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:13,589
Get them the cat food. Hurry up.

565
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:19,804
And they amassed
thousands of these weapons ...

566
00:33:19,972 --> 00:33:21,681
without the ability to use them.

567
00:33:21,849 --> 00:33:22,890
Fuck off! Go!

568
00:33:23,058 --> 00:33:25,143
Hey, friend, not you. You stay here.

569
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,644
What do you want with me?

570
00:33:26,812 --> 00:33:28,396
We just want to talk.

571
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,441
Talk about what?

572
00:33:32,735 --> 00:33:34,819
Stupid prawn.
They'll believe anything.

573
00:33:35,028 --> 00:33:37,447
"Muti" is a South African word.

574
00:33:37,656 --> 00:33:41,784
Today, it's synonymous
with witch-doctory and magic.

575
00:33:42,077 --> 00:33:43,911
You cut it here.

576
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:45,496
This is the heart.

577
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:48,458
It cures high blood pressure
when you boil it.

578
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:51,627
It cures diabetes, all diseases.

579
00:33:54,548 --> 00:33:57,467
The Nigerians were consuming
alien body parts.

580
00:33:57,634 --> 00:34:02,388
They believed that by doing so,
they were ingesting their power ...

581
00:34:02,598 --> 00:34:04,932
to use alien weaponry.

582
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,684
You must eat them ...

583
00:34:08,562 --> 00:34:12,231
and their power will live in you.

584
00:34:16,195 --> 00:34:19,113
Just give me a fucking chance
to go in front of you, man.

585
00:34:28,665 --> 00:34:30,166
- Oh, baby, thank God.
- Hi, baby.

586
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:32,001
- I need to get to the toilet.
- Why?

587
00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:34,337
- Why are the lights off?
- What's the matter?

588
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:38,466
- I might have crapped in my pants.
- Surprise!

589
00:34:42,095 --> 00:34:43,721
- What's this for?
- Your promotion.

590
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:45,932
Oh, right. Got my promotion.

591
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:48,267
- Oh, Dad, how's it going?
- Good to see you.

592
00:34:48,477 --> 00:34:51,437
Mom, how's it going? That's good.
Yeah, what a surprise, man.

593
00:34:51,647 --> 00:34:53,815
- Congrats on the promotion.
- Yeah, no, thanks.

594
00:34:53,982 --> 00:34:56,150
Congratulations, boss.
You're gonna be great.

595
00:34:56,318 --> 00:34:57,944
- Thanks.
- Wikus, what happened?

596
00:34:58,111 --> 00:35:01,072
Just had a small incident.
I'm just gonna go to the toilet ...

597
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,574
and then I'll talk to the people, okay?

598
00:35:03,742 --> 00:35:06,577
- I need to talk to you. Come with me.
- Okay, I just gotta --

599
00:35:06,745 --> 00:35:09,539
- Guys, can you give us a moment?
- Sure, no problem.

600
00:35:09,706 --> 00:35:11,457
What happened out there?

601
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:13,251
A small incident.

602
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:19,340
You know, an unruly prawn
and I just had to get him in my grasp.

603
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,009
Listen to me, too many aliens
died out there today.

604
00:35:22,177 --> 00:35:24,971
UIO is all over my backside.

605
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,975
Focus. You're not going
to fuck this up for me.

606
00:35:29,184 --> 00:35:32,687
If you can't do the job,
I'll find someone who can.

607
00:35:35,482 --> 00:35:38,276
- Hi, there.
- Hey, it's nice to see you again.

608
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:42,864
Now, does this mean he's
in charge of this new operation?

609
00:35:43,031 --> 00:35:44,907
- Yes.
- That's nice, eh?

610
00:35:45,117 --> 00:35:48,369
Wikus? Baby, are you okay?

611
00:35:58,755 --> 00:36:00,882
Okay, let's cut some cake.

612
00:36:01,049 --> 00:36:03,426
Cut some cake.

613
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:05,845
- He doesn't look very well.
- Are you all right?

614
00:36:15,022 --> 00:36:16,105
Just calm down, okay?

615
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:20,276
Wikus.

616
00:36:33,165 --> 00:36:36,876
Dr. Smith, please come to Room 405.
Dr. Smith.

617
00:36:41,965 --> 00:36:43,716
Is it --? Is it badly infected?

618
00:36:43,926 --> 00:36:45,676
There's a lot of suppuration.

619
00:36:45,886 --> 00:36:48,095
Also, you should know
on my right hand ...

620
00:36:48,263 --> 00:36:50,097
some fingernails
were coming loose.

621
00:36:50,265 --> 00:36:52,558
And I had a black fluid
coming out of my nose ...

622
00:36:52,726 --> 00:36:54,727
and sort of a black vomit.

623
00:36:57,981 --> 00:36:59,231
What happened to my arm?

624
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:01,317
- Just breathe deeply.
- What happened?

625
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:03,027
- This is oxygen.
- What is this?

626
00:37:03,195 --> 00:37:04,862
Just breathe deeply. Calm down.

627
00:37:05,322 --> 00:37:08,991
- Stay calm.
- Doctor, tell my wife.

628
00:37:09,618 --> 00:37:11,911
Go tell my wife.

629
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:18,709
Attention, all medical staff members,
evacuate yard 11 immediately.

630
00:37:18,877 --> 00:37:23,673
All medical staff members,
evacuate yard 11 immediately.

631
00:37:23,966 --> 00:37:26,050
Who the fuck are you, man?

632
00:37:27,386 --> 00:37:28,928
What the fuck is wrong with you?

633
00:37:29,096 --> 00:37:31,222
Fuck you! Fuck you!

634
00:37:32,307 --> 00:37:34,934
Get the fuck off me, you bitch! Fuck!

635
00:37:35,143 --> 00:37:37,228
What are you assholes
planning on doing?

636
00:37:38,563 --> 00:37:39,981
Stop right there, madam.

637
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,858
What's going on?
What are you doing to him?

638
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,443
- Let go of me!
- All right.

639
00:37:44,653 --> 00:37:47,613
- Let me through. Let me through!
- Good to go. Come on.

640
00:37:47,781 --> 00:37:49,824
- Wikus.
- Madam, get your hands off me.

641
00:37:49,992 --> 00:37:52,159
Where are you taking him?

642
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:55,788
We have the infected agent onboard.

643
00:37:55,956 --> 00:37:59,291
We're en route to MNU HQ
with an ETA of five minutes.

644
00:38:05,882 --> 00:38:07,758
Unzip it. Unzip it.

645
00:38:07,968 --> 00:38:09,301
Okay.

646
00:38:09,469 --> 00:38:12,179
- You got him? You ready?
- Yeah. Got him.

647
00:38:16,476 --> 00:38:19,020
Decided not to use any anesthetic.

648
00:38:19,187 --> 00:38:21,814
The reason being, with nitrous,
the subject reacts to --

649
00:38:21,982 --> 00:38:24,275
- Blood pressure is way above normal.
- Calm down.

650
00:38:24,443 --> 00:38:28,279
The arm is doing
some really interesting things.

651
00:38:28,447 --> 00:38:30,322
Aaron, what do you think
we've got here?

652
00:38:31,033 --> 00:38:35,453
We would have expected it to --
The antibodies to react and maintain.

653
00:38:35,662 --> 00:38:36,996
- Dr. Visser?
- Yes?

654
00:38:37,205 --> 00:38:38,622
I think you should see this.

655
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:42,376
I found it in his jacket.

656
00:38:42,544 --> 00:38:44,003
Do you think this is alien?

657
00:38:44,171 --> 00:38:47,089
No. No. No.

658
00:38:47,257 --> 00:38:48,299
No, don't.

659
00:38:49,051 --> 00:38:51,385
Don't. No.

660
00:38:52,179 --> 00:38:54,472
Sons of bitches leave me -- Fuck.

661
00:39:01,229 --> 00:39:03,064
Where is this?

662
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,944
What?

663
00:39:11,698 --> 00:39:15,242
What --? What are they doing
to these prawns?

664
00:39:18,997 --> 00:39:21,415
Pain threshold, test one, DBX-7.

665
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:24,502
Commencing test one, DBX-7.

666
00:39:28,548 --> 00:39:30,466
Now that's a strong pain reaction.

667
00:39:31,093 --> 00:39:33,552
That means the nerves have fused.

668
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,722
I mean, it's almost
completely integrated.

669
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,891
Okay, do it.

670
00:39:39,768 --> 00:39:42,645
- B5.
- Testing AMR-B5.

671
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:45,314
All right. Okay.

672
00:39:45,524 --> 00:39:47,066
- Clear the range.
- Range fire.

673
00:39:47,234 --> 00:39:50,152
- Now. Quickly.
- Quiet, please. We are now recording.

674
00:39:50,362 --> 00:39:51,946
Swing it around.

675
00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:54,281
- What are you doing?
- There we go.

676
00:39:54,449 --> 00:39:55,741
What are you doing?

677
00:39:56,326 --> 00:39:58,327
- Can you grip that?
- What is this?

678
00:39:58,495 --> 00:40:01,080
- Put it through.
- Why are you doing that with the gun?

679
00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:03,165
- Stand by to fire.
- Stand by.

680
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:05,709
- You want me to shoot that?
- Stand by.

681
00:40:05,919 --> 00:40:07,753
- Stand back.
- I cannot use this weapon.

682
00:40:07,921 --> 00:40:09,088
And fire.

683
00:40:11,716 --> 00:40:13,425
That's good.

684
00:40:13,635 --> 00:40:16,720
- It worked. That's satisfactory.
- AMR-B5 test complete.

685
00:40:16,888 --> 00:40:19,223
Right. Thanks very much.
Load up another target.

686
00:40:19,391 --> 00:40:21,559
- You got this?
- Do you know where my wife is?

687
00:40:21,726 --> 00:40:24,854
Do you know if my wife knows
where I am? Sir?

688
00:40:25,021 --> 00:40:27,273
Where's my wife?

689
00:40:28,108 --> 00:40:30,234
- Pull. Pull.
- I won't do that.

690
00:40:30,443 --> 00:40:31,902
No, sir, I will not pull it.

691
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,280
What did you say about your wife?

692
00:40:34,447 --> 00:40:37,116
- Fuck your wife.
- No, sir. No, please, sir. I will --

693
00:40:37,284 --> 00:40:39,535
- I will not pull.
- Have to use the prod again.

694
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:41,328
Fire.

695
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,917
- B7.
- AMR-B7.

696
00:40:47,085 --> 00:40:49,003
- I'll pull it.
- He says he can pull it.

697
00:40:49,171 --> 00:40:50,504
I can pull the trigger.

698
00:40:52,966 --> 00:40:54,758
I said I would pull it.

699
00:40:54,968 --> 00:40:56,010
- You rotten pig!
- Fire.

700
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,099
- B21.
- AMR-B21.

701
00:41:03,685 --> 00:41:05,811
Move. Hurry up. Move.

702
00:41:05,979 --> 00:41:07,938
We want him in the center,
by the chain.

703
00:41:08,106 --> 00:41:10,774
- Get this off me.
- Come on. Time. Time.

704
00:41:10,942 --> 00:41:14,236
Hey, leave that fucking prawn, man.
I will shoot a pig.

705
00:41:14,404 --> 00:41:17,573
I'll shoot -- Sir.
Listen. I'll shoot a pig again for you.

706
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:20,826
I'll pull the trigger, but I'm not shooting
that prawn, hear me?

707
00:41:20,994 --> 00:41:24,830
- Untie that fucking guy, man.
- B21. The human hand.

708
00:41:24,998 --> 00:41:26,665
That's good. It worked.

709
00:41:26,833 --> 00:41:29,919
Just untie that guy.
Untie that guy, sir.

710
00:41:30,128 --> 00:41:33,005
This is -- You can't use the real guy.
He didn't do anything.

711
00:41:33,381 --> 00:41:36,967
Right. I wanna observe this one.
You prod him.

712
00:41:37,135 --> 00:41:39,220
- Everybody standing by.
- Let him go.

713
00:41:39,387 --> 00:41:40,429
Ready to go?

714
00:41:40,597 --> 00:41:43,390
- Don't use a-- Oh, no.
- Three, two, one ...

715
00:41:43,558 --> 00:41:44,975
- Don't, don't, don't.
- go.

716
00:41:48,271 --> 00:41:49,313
Amazing.

717
00:41:49,481 --> 00:41:52,316
AMR-B21 test completed.

718
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:56,904
All right. I think that's all we need.

719
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:01,283
Gentlemen,
you're running out of time.

720
00:42:01,451 --> 00:42:04,328
This is the key stage
in the metamorphosis.

721
00:42:04,871 --> 00:42:08,499
His DNA is in perfect balance
between alien and human.

722
00:42:08,708 --> 00:42:11,877
The problem is,
as the infection spreads ...

723
00:42:12,045 --> 00:42:14,713
the transition becomes
permanent and less active.

724
00:42:15,257 --> 00:42:17,758
He's going to turn into one of them,
a prawn?

725
00:42:17,926 --> 00:42:19,677
What happens to him isn't important.

726
00:42:19,844 --> 00:42:23,222
What's important is that we harvest
from him what we can right now.

727
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:27,810
This body represents
hundreds of millions ...

728
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:31,230
maybe billions of dollars
worth of biotechnology.

729
00:42:31,398 --> 00:42:35,484
There are people out there,
governments, corporations ...

730
00:42:35,652 --> 00:42:37,653
who would kill for this chance.

731
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:41,365
- Will he survive the procedure?
- No, of course not.

732
00:42:41,533 --> 00:42:45,452
We need everything.
Tissue, bone marrow, blood.

733
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:49,248
The procedure's gonna basically
strip him down to nothing.

734
00:42:49,416 --> 00:42:50,958
What about next of kin?

735
00:42:51,126 --> 00:42:54,795
Please, help me. Don't let them do it.

736
00:42:54,963 --> 00:42:56,255
I'll handle that.

737
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,925
Okay. I say, let's go.

738
00:43:00,093 --> 00:43:02,303
Good. Thank you.

739
00:43:12,647 --> 00:43:17,609
I don't understand.
None of this makes any sense.

740
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:20,988
He just hurt his arm, Dad.

741
00:43:22,198 --> 00:43:23,866
The doctors are trying, sweetheart.

742
00:43:25,618 --> 00:43:28,078
They're doing their best to save him.

743
00:43:30,206 --> 00:43:32,958
We're starting to harvest material
from the specimen.

744
00:43:33,126 --> 00:43:36,253
We'll start with soft tissue first.
Cut through the chest cavity.

745
00:43:36,421 --> 00:43:38,589
We need to get the heart out quickly.

746
00:43:38,757 --> 00:43:42,551
Once the septicemia set in,
it just spread.

747
00:43:42,761 --> 00:43:45,679
- Don't touch me with this gas!
- Calm down.

748
00:43:45,847 --> 00:43:47,556
You know Wikus.

749
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:50,017
He never was very strong.

750
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:54,355
I'll go through the chest,
straight into the heart.

751
00:43:54,522 --> 00:43:56,357
- That should quiet him down.
- Fuck you!

752
00:43:56,733 --> 00:43:58,108
Can I see him?

753
00:44:01,654 --> 00:44:02,905
Not a good idea.

754
00:44:08,828 --> 00:44:10,371
Fuck you. Fuck you!

755
00:44:12,165 --> 00:44:15,501
You don't fucking come near me.
Don't fucking come near me.

756
00:44:22,425 --> 00:44:24,676
Fuck you. You big fucking man, huh?

757
00:44:27,764 --> 00:44:29,264
Hey. Hey. Drop the knife.

758
00:44:29,474 --> 00:44:33,060
Fuck you! Drop that thing
or I'll fucking cut his eyes out.

759
00:44:33,228 --> 00:44:36,105
Okay. All right. Okay.

760
00:44:37,399 --> 00:44:40,567
- We're gonna get you, mate.
- I'll fucking kill you. I'll kill you.

761
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,913
You need to let go of him now.

762
00:44:55,792 --> 00:45:00,754
That's okay, Tania.
Everything will be okay.

763
00:45:08,596 --> 00:45:10,305
Smit.

764
00:45:12,684 --> 00:45:14,184
When?

765
00:45:17,355 --> 00:45:18,397
Get Koobus.

766
00:45:44,591 --> 00:45:45,841
Hey, hey, wait, man.

767
00:45:56,352 --> 00:46:00,063
Wikus van de Merwe,
white male, mid-30s ...

768
00:46:00,273 --> 00:46:02,107
is considered highly dangerous.

769
00:46:02,317 --> 00:46:03,358
- Hello?
- Hi, baby.

770
00:46:03,526 --> 00:46:05,527
- Wikus? Is that you?
- It's Wikus --

771
00:46:05,695 --> 00:46:07,988
- Mrs. Smit? Hi.
- How dare you phone us.

772
00:46:08,156 --> 00:46:10,949
- What are all these people doing?
- None of your business.

773
00:46:11,117 --> 00:46:13,202
I need to speak
to Tania straightaway.

774
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:15,829
It's my house. This is my
phone that you are using.

775
00:46:15,997 --> 00:46:18,165
- I'm fucking -- What?
- It's disgusting.

776
00:46:19,584 --> 00:46:22,377
- He tried calling me.
- Anton, it's me. It's me. Accept --

777
00:46:22,545 --> 00:46:23,837
Accept the call.

778
00:46:24,005 --> 00:46:27,257
I've been friends with you
for fucking 19 years, man.

779
00:46:27,467 --> 00:46:29,885
Fuck off! What are you
watching, man? Fuck off!

780
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:32,638
We thought it was for the best
because he needed help.

781
00:46:34,015 --> 00:46:37,684
Special medical help. And he wasn't
gonna get that as a fugitive.

782
00:46:37,852 --> 00:46:39,561
Move, move, move.

783
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:43,232
Go, go, go.

784
00:46:43,399 --> 00:46:48,654
He became the most valuable
business artifact on Earth.

785
00:46:50,156 --> 00:46:53,033
He was the only human
who had ever ...

786
00:46:53,201 --> 00:46:57,162
successfully been combined with
alien genetics and remained alive.

787
00:46:57,622 --> 00:47:01,875
But his real value was that
he could operate alien weaponry.

788
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:11,260
Hello.

789
00:47:11,427 --> 00:47:15,222
Can I get seven schnitzel burgers
and a large sauer klopse, please?

790
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:18,058
We interrupt this program
to bring you breaking news.

791
00:47:18,226 --> 00:47:22,479
A patient has escaped from the
isolation ward and is loose in the city.

792
00:47:22,647 --> 00:47:25,065
Wikus van de Merwe
was recently apprehended ...

793
00:47:25,233 --> 00:47:29,111
after prolonged sexual activity
with aliens in District 9.

794
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,529
Oh, you bliksem.

795
00:47:30,697 --> 00:47:31,947
I have to call my manager.

796
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:34,950
That's totally untrue.
You are legally obliged to serve me.

797
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:36,994
-- which is causing
bodily disfigurement.

798
00:47:37,161 --> 00:47:39,496
Can I buy your burger, please?
If I could just --

799
00:47:39,664 --> 00:47:41,290
- It's contagious.
- Don't listen.

800
00:47:41,457 --> 00:47:44,418
Police warn people to stay
at least 20 meters away.

801
00:47:44,627 --> 00:47:46,753
No, look at this hand.
This hand is fine!

802
00:47:46,921 --> 00:47:50,591
If you have any information regarding
the whereabouts of van de Merwe ...

803
00:47:50,758 --> 00:47:54,094
please contact us immediately
on 0-800-STOP-WIKUS.

804
00:47:54,262 --> 00:47:57,347
- You fucking freak! Stop!
- Don't go away, after the break ...

805
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:09,860
- Hi. This is Tania.
- And Wikus.

806
00:48:10,028 --> 00:48:14,323
We can't come to the phone right now.
Please leave a message. Bye.

807
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:17,367
- Bye-bye.
- Good things!

808
00:48:27,211 --> 00:48:30,839
Control, this is Bird Dog 7. We're
set up at all major exits to the city.

809
00:48:31,007 --> 00:48:36,136
There's no sign of Mr. van de Merwe.
We are in total lockdown at this point.

810
00:48:58,743 --> 00:49:02,871
The entire world was watching him.

811
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:07,000
He was on every radio station,
every image on television.

812
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,920
Anything you could find
had his face on it.

813
00:49:10,088 --> 00:49:11,588
So he had nowhere else to go.

814
00:49:12,674 --> 00:49:15,384
He ended up hiding
in the one place he knew ...

815
00:49:15,593 --> 00:49:18,637
no one would ever come
looking for him.

816
00:50:38,092 --> 00:50:41,219
I'm not playing here.
6 rand 50 or nothing.

817
00:50:41,512 --> 00:50:43,513
I pay you next week, I promise.

818
00:50:43,681 --> 00:50:45,348
No money, you get nothing.

819
00:50:45,516 --> 00:50:48,143
Fucking prawn, this isn't a charity.

820
00:50:50,938 --> 00:50:54,483
Hello. I'd like to buy
some meat, please.

821
00:50:56,527 --> 00:51:00,614
Yes, have you got hamburger
or, you know, steak roll?

822
00:51:00,782 --> 00:51:03,116
Does it look like a hamburger shop?

823
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:05,118
- Which one do you want?
- Goat, then.

824
00:51:05,286 --> 00:51:08,747
Come on, come on, come on, man.
I don't have all day here.

825
00:51:09,123 --> 00:51:10,916
- Is that cat food there?
- Yeah, it is.

826
00:51:11,083 --> 00:51:13,460
That's cat food, eh?
I'll have some of that, guys.

827
00:51:13,628 --> 00:51:14,669
- Is that all?
- Yeah.

828
00:51:36,067 --> 00:51:37,108
Fuck, man.

829
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:00,924
Hello? Hello?

830
00:52:01,592 --> 00:52:02,968
Ba --

831
00:52:04,095 --> 00:52:07,264
Baby, is that you? Tania?

832
00:52:07,431 --> 00:52:09,766
Oh, God, please, let it be you.

833
00:52:10,309 --> 00:52:13,854
- Yes, it's me.
- Baby --

834
00:52:14,021 --> 00:52:16,648
I'm so happy you called me, baby.

835
00:52:16,816 --> 00:52:20,944
- Wikus, listen to me.
- Okay.

836
00:52:21,112 --> 00:52:25,156
I have something to say to you
and it's not gonna be easy.

837
00:52:25,324 --> 00:52:28,118
No, okay, look. Listen, baby,
before you say anything.

838
00:52:28,661 --> 00:52:31,955
Your father is working against me,
baby. He's lying to you.

839
00:52:32,498 --> 00:52:35,792
I did not have sex with one of these ...

840
00:52:36,335 --> 00:52:37,752
fucking creatures, man.

841
00:52:37,962 --> 00:52:40,630
I would never have
any kind of pornographic activity ...

842
00:52:40,798 --> 00:52:43,592
with a fucking creature. Baby --

843
00:52:43,759 --> 00:52:46,553
But they said that you'd become
obsessed with them.

844
00:52:47,263 --> 00:52:48,930
I can't do this.

845
00:52:49,098 --> 00:52:51,850
Baby, please, don't give up on me,
you know?

846
00:52:52,059 --> 00:52:55,854
Don't give up on me
because I can -- I --

847
00:52:56,022 --> 00:52:58,982
I wanna see you again, baby.
And I'm gonna fix my arm ...

848
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:01,109
and I'm gonna see you again ...

849
00:53:01,277 --> 00:53:03,904
and I'm gonna kiss you
and I'm gonna hold you again.

850
00:53:04,071 --> 00:53:07,365
I don't want you to hold me again.

851
00:53:10,202 --> 00:53:15,916
Baby?

852
00:53:28,888 --> 00:53:33,141
Hey, hey. What the --?
Hey, hey. Hey, man. Hey.

853
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:54,162
Okay.

854
00:54:20,231 --> 00:54:21,940
-- directly to the left of us.

855
00:54:22,108 --> 00:54:24,818
Roger that. I'll send you
a couple choppers back up and --

856
00:54:45,589 --> 00:54:46,631
You!

857
00:54:47,591 --> 00:54:49,509
What do you want?

858
00:54:53,639 --> 00:54:56,599
Copy, control. No sign of the target.
Moving to Sector 6.

859
00:54:57,309 --> 00:54:58,852
You have to go.

860
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:01,229
Okay, please, I need your help. Okay?

861
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:05,150
Okay. We gonna play hide and seek.

862
00:55:05,443 --> 00:55:06,317
Yes! Yes!

863
00:55:06,485 --> 00:55:07,402
You wanna help me hide?

864
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:08,611
No, get back.

865
00:55:08,779 --> 00:55:09,904
Show me your favorite hiding place.

866
00:55:10,072 --> 00:55:12,240
Please, just go.

867
00:55:12,408 --> 00:55:13,491
Leave us alone.

868
00:55:13,659 --> 00:55:16,453
No. Please, you don't --
I need to hide.

869
00:55:16,662 --> 00:55:20,248
Okay? They're coming.
They wanna kill me. All right?

870
00:55:20,416 --> 00:55:24,502
I just need to hide here, sir,
for five minutes. Okay? I just need to --

871
00:55:35,473 --> 00:55:38,975
What is this kak? What are you
doing here? I remember you.

872
00:55:39,143 --> 00:55:41,102
Nothing. You must hide
somewhere else.

873
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:45,148
Please, sir, you have to help me. I'm
losing blood. They're trying to kill me.

874
00:55:58,412 --> 00:56:01,539
Only one thing
that could make that happen.

875
00:56:01,832 --> 00:56:06,419
Quick, we have to hide him.

876
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:09,881
Now you, get down there.

877
00:56:22,269 --> 00:56:23,978
Where the fuck I am?

878
00:56:24,146 --> 00:56:25,188
Where's the fluid?

879
00:56:25,356 --> 00:56:26,773
What did you do with it?

880
00:56:26,941 --> 00:56:27,982
Please.

881
00:56:28,192 --> 00:56:29,234
You took it.

882
00:56:29,443 --> 00:56:30,527
I don't know what you're talking about.

883
00:56:30,694 --> 00:56:31,986
I know you did.

884
00:56:32,154 --> 00:56:35,031
I can see what's happening to you.

885
00:56:35,741 --> 00:56:38,118
Tell me where it is.

886
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:41,329
Right, right.

887
00:56:42,289 --> 00:56:44,290
Was it a black fluid
in a glass container?

888
00:56:44,458 --> 00:56:47,502
Yes, that's it. Yes!

889
00:56:47,795 --> 00:56:51,422
Right. I confiscated it,
and the guys at the lab took it.

890
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:53,633
It'll be at MNU. MNU has it.

891
00:56:55,636 --> 00:56:57,929
Okay. Okay.

892
00:57:04,103 --> 00:57:05,895
What is this?

893
00:57:06,147 --> 00:57:07,397
You ruined everything.

894
00:57:07,606 --> 00:57:09,440
Where is this?

895
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:14,737
Is that your shack?

896
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:19,242
This whole thing's
under your shack?

897
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:23,496
For 20 years you've had this fucking
thing hidden down here. This is --

898
00:57:24,331 --> 00:57:26,332
This is very illegal.

899
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:30,378
I mean, this is a fine,
you know, if they --

900
00:57:30,546 --> 00:57:31,880
If they catch you with this.

901
00:57:34,925 --> 00:57:37,135
Fuel goes in here!

902
00:57:37,595 --> 00:57:39,888
That's enough! Quiet!

903
00:57:40,097 --> 00:57:41,973
Then we fly away.

904
00:57:42,266 --> 00:57:44,309
I said quiet! We cannot trust him.

905
00:57:44,476 --> 00:57:48,229
What is he saying about the fuel?
Are you trying to start this thing?

906
00:57:48,397 --> 00:57:51,983
Are you little fuckers
trying to start this and get away, eh?

907
00:57:52,443 --> 00:57:53,985
Never mind.

908
00:57:54,195 --> 00:57:56,237
Yeah, you sneaky
fucking prawns, eh?

909
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:58,865
Too bad. I could've fixed you.

910
00:57:59,408 --> 00:58:03,828
What? What did you say
about the fixing?

911
00:58:03,996 --> 00:58:05,371
What, you could fix me?

912
00:58:05,539 --> 00:58:06,581
Forget it.

913
00:58:07,374 --> 00:58:09,000
It doesn't matter, it's too late.

914
00:58:09,168 --> 00:58:13,421
No. No. Listen, listen. Are you saying
that you could turn this --

915
00:58:13,589 --> 00:58:17,008
This prawn hand into a human hand?
You can make me human again?

916
00:58:17,176 --> 00:58:21,804
We have medical machines on
the mother ship that can fix you. Yes.

917
00:58:22,431 --> 00:58:25,850
We can use this ship to fly up there.

918
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:28,353
That's fantastic.
You guys are brilliant, eh?

919
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,688
I always thought
the prawns were intelligent.

920
00:58:30,856 --> 00:58:32,357
Let's do it.

921
00:58:32,524 --> 00:58:34,692
I don't have fluid.

922
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:39,697
I could fix you and I could fly away.
But I don't have fluid.

923
00:58:39,907 --> 00:58:41,699
Right. Right. Okay.

924
00:58:41,867 --> 00:58:45,161
All right, I'll tell you
what, why don't we go --?

925
00:58:45,329 --> 00:58:47,497
Let's get some more.
Let's go collect some up.

926
00:58:47,665 --> 00:58:51,918
It took 20 years
to collect that amount.

927
00:58:52,127 --> 00:58:55,088
Fuck, man. Fuck!

928
00:58:55,256 --> 00:58:58,424
Fuck! The only one
is the one I confiscated?

929
00:58:58,592 --> 00:59:00,093
Yes.

930
00:59:00,511 --> 00:59:02,303
It's four stories under ground.

931
00:59:09,561 --> 00:59:11,396
Why's he keep looking at me like that?

932
00:59:11,563 --> 00:59:13,231
He likes you.

933
00:59:13,857 --> 00:59:15,233
We are the same.

934
00:59:15,401 --> 00:59:18,736
Fuck off, man. I'm not the same.

935
00:59:18,904 --> 00:59:21,155
Not the fucking same.

936
00:59:27,663 --> 00:59:29,372
There is a way out of this.

937
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:34,043
We get the fluid back from MNU.

938
00:59:35,296 --> 00:59:39,048
And what then? Then we both die, eh?
Both of us dead.

939
00:59:39,591 --> 00:59:41,217
That's a suicide mission.

940
00:59:41,385 --> 00:59:44,053
Can you not fill my head
with that sort of nonsense?

941
00:59:46,056 --> 00:59:48,808
The transformation is accelerating.

942
00:59:51,395 --> 00:59:54,188
You do not have much time.

943
00:59:55,566 --> 00:59:57,900
Oh, Christ.

944
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:26,262
Fuck. Okay.

945
01:00:44,365 --> 01:00:47,575
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

946
01:01:11,892 --> 01:01:14,477
- Hello?
- Wikus?

947
01:01:14,645 --> 01:01:18,106
- Tania? Baby.
- Are you okay?

948
01:01:18,273 --> 01:01:20,191
Oh, God. Thank God.

949
01:01:20,359 --> 01:01:22,527
Where are you?

950
01:01:26,448 --> 01:01:29,200
All those things my father said ...

951
01:01:29,368 --> 01:01:31,828
I know he was trying to protect me.

952
01:01:33,455 --> 01:01:36,165
I just don't know
what to believe anymore.

953
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:39,335
Baby, baby, I know, but listen to me.
It's all lies.

954
01:01:39,503 --> 01:01:43,423
I swear to you.
Everything he said to you is lies.

955
01:01:43,924 --> 01:01:45,049
I know.

956
01:01:45,217 --> 01:01:47,802
What? What?

957
01:01:48,345 --> 01:01:51,556
I believe you, Wikus.
I just want you back.

958
01:01:51,723 --> 01:01:54,058
I want everything back
the way it was.

959
01:01:54,226 --> 01:01:58,938
That's -- Baby, that's what I want.
That's what -- That's great.

960
01:01:59,106 --> 01:02:03,985
That's great news. I can make it
the way it was, if you take me back.

961
01:02:04,361 --> 01:02:08,656
But how? How can we go back?

962
01:02:11,827 --> 01:02:15,538
I have a plan, and I know how to fix it.
All right?

963
01:02:15,706 --> 01:02:17,957
I know how to fix myself.
And it'll be me ...

964
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:20,001
and we'll be back together.

965
01:02:20,586 --> 01:02:22,503
You promise me?

966
01:02:22,671 --> 01:02:24,672
I promise you, baby.

967
01:02:25,757 --> 01:02:31,345
Don't give up on me, okay? Because
I haven't given up on you, all right?

968
01:02:31,513 --> 01:02:32,889
I won't.

969
01:02:33,432 --> 01:02:35,349
I love you.

970
01:02:35,517 --> 01:02:38,019
I love you too.

971
01:02:38,896 --> 01:02:40,938
- Tell me you got a fix on him.
- D-9.

972
01:02:49,823 --> 01:02:52,158
How many moons
does our planet have?

973
01:02:57,706 --> 01:02:59,290
Seven.

974
01:03:01,376 --> 01:03:04,170
This planet only has one.

975
01:03:05,088 --> 01:03:07,131
I can't wait to see our planet.

976
01:03:07,299 --> 01:03:08,925
It is bigger than this one, isn't it?

977
01:03:09,092 --> 01:03:11,302
Enough.

978
01:03:12,596 --> 01:03:13,930
We go home now?

979
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:18,768
Not home. No.

980
01:03:19,144 --> 01:03:23,105
This is where we must go.

981
01:03:23,774 --> 01:03:25,316
See that tent there?

982
01:03:25,484 --> 01:03:26,901
That might be ours.

983
01:03:28,654 --> 01:03:31,405
I want to go home!

984
01:03:32,783 --> 01:03:38,621
We can't go home. Not anymore.

985
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:47,797
Hi. You don't wanna go to the tents.
They're not better.

986
01:03:48,006 --> 01:03:49,882
They're smaller than the shacks.

987
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:52,426
Actually more like
a concentration camp.

988
01:03:52,636 --> 01:03:57,682
If I can get you that black fluid,
what happens then?

989
01:03:58,058 --> 01:03:59,934
We go up to the mother ship.

990
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:02,144
And you can start that thing?

991
01:04:02,354 --> 01:04:03,437
Yes.

992
01:04:04,189 --> 01:04:09,068
Okay. So just to be clear,
this is gonna go back --

993
01:04:10,654 --> 01:04:14,865
This is gonna go back
to be human like this.

994
01:04:15,033 --> 01:04:16,367
I can go home.

995
01:04:16,577 --> 01:04:19,495
And then, you can go home.
You can take your boy.

996
01:04:19,663 --> 01:04:22,915
You can take all the prawns.
If I could get you that fluid, right?

997
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:26,961
You said it was a suicide mission.

998
01:04:27,754 --> 01:04:29,505
Maybe you were right.

999
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:33,759
We have no weapons.
They'll shoot us on sight.

1000
01:04:35,137 --> 01:04:37,763
Look. Look, Christopher.

1001
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:40,891
I know where we can get weapons.

1002
01:04:48,984 --> 01:04:52,236
Hi, guys. Hello. Hi, hi. Hello.

1003
01:04:53,864 --> 01:04:57,241
- I'd like to buy some weapons, please.
- No, no, no. Hold it.

1004
01:04:57,576 --> 01:04:59,744
How did you do this one, my man?

1005
01:05:01,288 --> 01:05:03,998
It's doggy-style with a demon.

1006
01:05:05,584 --> 01:05:07,335
You're one brave white man.

1007
01:05:07,544 --> 01:05:09,503
Were you wearing a condom?

1008
01:05:10,964 --> 01:05:13,799
I need to buy weapons, please.

1009
01:05:14,676 --> 01:05:18,721
You and I both know that
there are illegal weapons inside there.

1010
01:05:18,889 --> 01:05:23,559
I have money and I would like to buy
some of those wea --

1011
01:05:24,144 --> 01:05:26,854
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1012
01:05:29,232 --> 01:05:32,401
- I brought you here to make me money.
- Sit. Don't move around.

1013
01:05:32,569 --> 01:05:35,279
You're fucking wasting my time.

1014
01:05:36,448 --> 01:05:39,617
Shut up. Fucking lying bitch.

1015
01:05:46,416 --> 01:05:50,711
Thank -- Thank you, sir, for your time.
Thank you very much for seeing me.

1016
01:05:52,255 --> 01:05:53,881
I would like to buy some weapons.

1017
01:05:54,091 --> 01:05:59,470
AK-47, some grenades,
maybe tear-gas canisters.

1018
01:05:59,638 --> 01:06:01,639
I see you have limpet mines here,
as well.

1019
01:06:01,807 --> 01:06:06,394
And I also see you guys have
alien weapons there, which is great.

1020
01:06:06,561 --> 01:06:09,105
I could have one or two of those.

1021
01:06:09,272 --> 01:06:11,941
I have money, okay?

1022
01:06:12,109 --> 01:06:14,443
Now, I'm s --

1023
01:06:18,073 --> 01:06:20,408
Sir. Please, sir. Please, sir.
Please, sir.

1024
01:06:20,909 --> 01:06:22,159
I've heard about you.

1025
01:06:22,911 --> 01:06:23,953
Where do you have it?

1026
01:06:24,121 --> 01:06:25,538
Show me.

1027
01:06:26,164 --> 01:06:27,248
Oh, shit!

1028
01:06:28,834 --> 01:06:30,376
Come here. Come.

1029
01:06:32,129 --> 01:06:34,380
Shit.

1030
01:06:37,217 --> 01:06:40,553
No, no, no. No, please.

1031
01:06:44,099 --> 01:06:48,352
Why are you doing that? Why is he --?
What is he --? What do you want?

1032
01:06:48,854 --> 01:06:50,229
- What do you --?
- Shut up.

1033
01:06:50,397 --> 01:06:52,064
Please.

1034
01:06:52,232 --> 01:06:53,274
Sir, don't.

1035
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:55,943
Forget the weapons.
Forget the weapons.

1036
01:06:56,111 --> 01:06:57,236
Forget the weapons.

1037
01:06:57,404 --> 01:06:59,155
I want the arm. Cut it off.

1038
01:06:59,322 --> 01:07:01,866
What's he saying?
What does he want? What did he say?

1039
01:07:02,033 --> 01:07:04,577
What does he want? What does he --?

1040
01:07:13,962 --> 01:07:16,172
I'll show you. I'm gonna teach you.

1041
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:17,882
Hey, hey, hey.

1042
01:07:19,718 --> 01:07:20,843
Holy shit.

1043
01:07:26,516 --> 01:07:28,392
You tell them to stand down.

1044
01:07:33,857 --> 01:07:35,524
You tell them to be quiet.

1045
01:07:35,692 --> 01:07:38,694
You, back off. Put your gun down.

1046
01:07:39,362 --> 01:07:41,614
Tell them to put the weapons
in the bag, man.

1047
01:07:41,782 --> 01:07:45,159
Fuck. Give me
the fucking weapons, man.

1048
01:07:46,453 --> 01:07:47,870
Don't you fucking look at me.

1049
01:07:49,498 --> 01:07:53,334
I said don't fucking look at me.

1050
01:07:58,006 --> 01:07:59,548
How did you get that hand?

1051
01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:03,093
Fucking hurry up, man.

1052
01:08:03,261 --> 01:08:04,929
Look at me
when I fucking speak to you.

1053
01:08:05,096 --> 01:08:06,305
What is your secret?

1054
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:07,640
What did you do?

1055
01:08:07,808 --> 01:08:09,225
Tell me.

1056
01:08:10,811 --> 01:08:12,394
I want that fucking arm.

1057
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:14,522
What the fuck did you do?

1058
01:08:14,898 --> 01:08:16,774
You fucking mizungo,
I'm coming for you.

1059
01:08:16,942 --> 01:08:18,526
I'm coming for you.
I'm going to get you.

1060
01:08:20,278 --> 01:08:21,570
Drop the fucking knife.

1061
01:08:21,738 --> 01:08:24,323
- Drop your fucking knife!
- Easy, easy.

1062
01:08:31,832 --> 01:08:34,291
And no live ammo.
He's useless to us dead.

1063
01:08:34,459 --> 01:08:36,043
Would you relax?

1064
01:08:36,211 --> 01:08:39,964
For fuck's sakes. My men have
done this a hundred times before.

1065
01:08:40,173 --> 01:08:43,926
Maintaining a visual on that location
at November-Alpha-1-9-1-1.

1066
01:08:44,135 --> 01:08:47,054
- The unit is closing in now, sir.
- It's gonna be quick.

1067
01:08:48,098 --> 01:08:50,099
It's gonna be clean.

1068
01:08:51,351 --> 01:08:52,393
And best of all ...

1069
01:08:52,936 --> 01:08:55,104
it's gonna be quiet.

1070
01:08:55,605 --> 01:08:58,649
Van de Merwe hasn't got a clue
what's coming his way.

1071
01:09:02,404 --> 01:09:03,779
It's empty.

1072
01:09:03,947 --> 01:09:05,155
Where are they?

1073
01:09:06,074 --> 01:09:08,659
The target is gone.
The place is empty.

1074
01:09:08,827 --> 01:09:11,287
What do you mean, "empty"?
Where the fuck is he?

1075
01:09:12,038 --> 01:09:15,165
That little shithead has got no idea
what's coming his way.

1076
01:09:15,333 --> 01:09:16,792
I'm gonna find him.

1077
01:09:21,381 --> 01:09:24,758
Security breach, Level 2.
Please proceed to the nearest exit.

1078
01:09:24,926 --> 01:09:26,427
Do not use --

1079
01:09:26,678 --> 01:09:30,556
There are the guards. At the gate.
Watch the guards at the gate, man.

1080
01:09:30,724 --> 01:09:32,141
Come on.

1081
01:09:34,311 --> 01:09:37,271
Security breach, Level 2.
Please proceed to the nearest exit.

1082
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:39,982
Move. Get out. Get out!

1083
01:09:41,943 --> 01:09:44,194
- Don't shoot!
- Go.

1084
01:09:45,405 --> 01:09:47,323
Going down. Four stories down.

1085
01:09:47,908 --> 01:09:50,451
This is alien weaponry.
Give me a status report.

1086
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:52,411
Security breach, Level 4. Bio lab.

1087
01:09:52,579 --> 01:09:55,706
- It's van de Merwe. He's on Level 4.
- Switch to live ammo.

1088
01:09:55,874 --> 01:09:58,334
- We're taking him out.
- Colonel.

1089
01:09:58,501 --> 01:10:00,544
We were ordered
not to use live ammunition.

1090
01:10:00,712 --> 01:10:03,005
- They want him alive.
- Security breach, Level 4.

1091
01:10:06,676 --> 01:10:09,136
Okay. Stay here until I call you.

1092
01:10:09,304 --> 01:10:10,387
I understand.

1093
01:10:10,555 --> 01:10:12,056
I need to get the door open.

1094
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:14,433
Possible alien tissue detected.

1095
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:16,268
I said, stay until I call you.

1096
01:10:16,436 --> 01:10:19,313
Wait for the decontamination
process to finish before --

1097
01:10:19,522 --> 01:10:21,398
You trying to get yourself killed?

1098
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:24,693
Fuck!

1099
01:10:26,071 --> 01:10:27,821
I thought you said not to kill them?

1100
01:10:28,907 --> 01:10:30,866
He shot at me.

1101
01:10:33,036 --> 01:10:36,121
Open up! Get the fuck out!
Don't fucking look at me. Get out!

1102
01:10:36,289 --> 01:10:37,623
Get the fuck out!

1103
01:10:43,046 --> 01:10:44,421
Okay.

1104
01:10:51,304 --> 01:10:54,723
- Move, move, move.
- Get out! Everybody get the fuck out!

1105
01:10:54,933 --> 01:10:58,060
Get out! Go! Move out of here now!

1106
01:10:58,228 --> 01:11:01,063
I'll send you home
in a fucking jar. Go!

1107
01:11:01,898 --> 01:11:02,982
What is this place?

1108
01:11:03,149 --> 01:11:05,234
Don't worry about that.

1109
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:07,027
What do they do in here?

1110
01:11:07,195 --> 01:11:08,779
It's in one of these.

1111
01:11:10,782 --> 01:11:12,282
Check these. Check these boxes.

1112
01:11:12,450 --> 01:11:16,286
Any kind of a box that looks like
it can hold a tube. Just check that.

1113
01:11:16,496 --> 01:11:18,247
These fuckers.

1114
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:23,669
Go, go, go.

1115
01:11:26,089 --> 01:11:27,464
Clear.

1116
01:11:32,595 --> 01:11:35,681
- Security breach ...
- I got it! I got it.

1117
01:11:39,102 --> 01:11:42,396
Chris, I got it. Let's go. Let's go.

1118
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,315
Christopher.

1119
01:11:48,528 --> 01:11:49,570
Oh, fuck.

1120
01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:54,950
Listen. Listen, I didn't -- I promise you,
I didn't know they were doing this.

1121
01:11:55,118 --> 01:11:58,746
Until they brought me here the other
day, I swear to you, I did not know ...

1122
01:11:58,913 --> 01:12:01,081
they were doing this, but --
Christopher.

1123
01:12:01,249 --> 01:12:03,625
Christopher, listen, look at me.
Listen to me.

1124
01:12:03,793 --> 01:12:06,462
We need to leave now. Okay?

1125
01:12:06,629 --> 01:12:08,964
The whole of MNU is gonna
come down here.

1126
01:12:09,132 --> 01:12:10,799
He's going to destroy us.

1127
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:15,095
We are big, but quick.
We can do this.

1128
01:12:15,305 --> 01:12:17,765
- Okay, we're gonna get out of here.
- Target. Fire!

1129
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:20,809
Move, move, move.

1130
01:12:23,563 --> 01:12:24,813
Move down the row. Move.

1131
01:12:31,946 --> 01:12:33,447
- Fuck.
- Move close.

1132
01:12:34,032 --> 01:12:35,324
You fucking bastard.

1133
01:12:35,533 --> 01:12:37,951
- Christopher, what are you doing?
- Two o'clock.

1134
01:12:38,578 --> 01:12:39,828
Cover the sides.

1135
01:12:42,957 --> 01:12:44,625
The bugs, the bugs, the bugs!

1136
01:12:46,086 --> 01:12:48,962
Think of your boy, for fuck's sake.

1137
01:12:57,931 --> 01:13:00,682
What are you doing?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

1138
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:02,101
Move, move!

1139
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:04,978
You'll get us killed.

1140
01:13:05,146 --> 01:13:07,564
What do we do now?

1141
01:13:07,774 --> 01:13:09,983
Fuck, yeah, man. Come on.

1142
01:13:10,193 --> 01:13:11,568
It's a fucking dead end.

1143
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,570
I thought you had a way out?

1144
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:17,241
I didn't say anything about a way out.
I promised you we'd get in. We're in.

1145
01:13:17,408 --> 01:13:18,450
I have an idea.

1146
01:13:18,618 --> 01:13:19,743
What? Where are you going?

1147
01:13:19,911 --> 01:13:21,161
Follow me.

1148
01:13:21,329 --> 01:13:23,122
Follow you?

1149
01:13:26,876 --> 01:13:27,709
What are you doing?

1150
01:13:27,877 --> 01:13:29,128
Making a bomb!

1151
01:13:29,295 --> 01:13:30,379
I've got you, Wikus.

1152
01:13:30,547 --> 01:13:31,380
Let's go!

1153
01:13:31,548 --> 01:13:33,006
It's a dead end.

1154
01:13:44,435 --> 01:13:46,603
Come on. Get in.

1155
01:13:48,481 --> 01:13:49,773
Go! Drive!

1156
01:13:51,109 --> 01:13:52,359
Okay.

1157
01:13:54,946 --> 01:13:56,238
Okay, hold on.

1158
01:14:05,623 --> 01:14:09,626
Reports are coming in of an explosion
in downtown Johannesburg.

1159
01:14:09,836 --> 01:14:13,672
Well, there was a terrorist attack,
but I can assure you we've dealt with it.

1160
01:14:17,594 --> 01:14:21,972
Drop it now. We drop it now.
The cunt!

1161
01:14:29,522 --> 01:14:31,064
They're really pissed at us now.

1162
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:37,321
Shit.

1163
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:43,994
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1164
01:14:45,705 --> 01:14:48,290
Don't drop that fucking thing.

1165
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:59,676
Come on, come on, come on. Move.
Get down there.

1166
01:14:59,886 --> 01:15:02,846
Go down and initiate
the binary commands.

1167
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:08,018
Set it down right now.

1168
01:15:08,228 --> 01:15:10,896
When we get to the mother ship,
how long is this gonna take?

1169
01:15:11,064 --> 01:15:12,397
To do what?

1170
01:15:12,565 --> 01:15:13,815
The fixing. To fix me.

1171
01:15:14,275 --> 01:15:16,276
It's going to take
a bit longer than I thought.

1172
01:15:16,444 --> 01:15:19,154
Okay. All right. That's fine.
How long do you need?

1173
01:15:19,405 --> 01:15:21,073
Three years.

1174
01:15:21,282 --> 01:15:23,659
Sorry, wait. Just go slowly
with the clicks there.

1175
01:15:23,826 --> 01:15:27,746
It sounded like you said "three years."
Like human years.

1176
01:15:28,122 --> 01:15:30,332
Yes. Three years.

1177
01:15:30,792 --> 01:15:33,252
What? Three fucking years?

1178
01:15:33,461 --> 01:15:35,504
I will fix you ...

1179
01:15:35,672 --> 01:15:39,883
but first I must save my people.

1180
01:15:40,093 --> 01:15:43,470
The deal was,
you go home, I get fixed.

1181
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:47,516
I will not let my people
be medical experiments!

1182
01:15:47,725 --> 01:15:50,185
I'm a fucking medical experiment.
You hear me?

1183
01:15:50,353 --> 01:15:53,063
I'm a fucking
medical experiment, man.

1184
01:15:53,231 --> 01:15:59,361
I must go home and get help. I must
use all the fluid to travel quickly.

1185
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:04,157
I'll just stay here, Christopher.
I'll just stay here in this shack.

1186
01:16:04,367 --> 01:16:06,159
And I'll see you in three years time?

1187
01:16:06,327 --> 01:16:07,869
I will come back. I promise.

1188
01:16:08,037 --> 01:16:09,663
Hey, Christopher.

1189
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:27,014
Arriving on the ground. First
Reaction Battalion is in pursuit. Over.

1190
01:16:32,103 --> 01:16:33,603
Where the fuck is he?

1191
01:16:35,315 --> 01:16:36,940
Hey.

1192
01:16:37,108 --> 01:16:39,693
You got Wikus down there, my boy?

1193
01:16:41,070 --> 01:16:42,154
Father!

1194
01:16:42,447 --> 01:16:46,616
No. Your daddy needs to stay there
to sort out a few things, all right?

1195
01:16:46,784 --> 01:16:50,579
But we're gonna go and we're come
back and fetch him. Okay? All right?

1196
01:16:54,625 --> 01:16:55,250
In here?

1197
01:16:55,418 --> 01:16:56,251
In there.

1198
01:16:56,419 --> 01:16:57,711
It goes in here, eh?

1199
01:16:57,879 --> 01:17:00,630
How the fuck
do you open this, prawn?

1200
01:17:04,177 --> 01:17:05,302
Father.

1201
01:17:06,137 --> 01:17:08,764
Tell me, you fucker.
You want me to fucking kill you?

1202
01:17:08,931 --> 01:17:13,101
Hey? Is that what you fucking want?
Hey?

1203
01:17:17,523 --> 01:17:18,815
Hey?

1204
01:17:21,903 --> 01:17:25,322
Okay. Let's see.

1205
01:17:27,658 --> 01:17:28,992
What?

1206
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:31,912
What? Okay. There's no buttons.

1207
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,580
- On.
- Open it.

1208
01:17:34,624 --> 01:17:37,292
- Activate.
- You have five seconds to tell me.

1209
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:40,754
One prawn, one bullet.

1210
01:17:46,177 --> 01:17:49,304
I can't believe I get paid to do this.

1211
01:17:50,848 --> 01:17:54,434
I love watching you prawns die.

1212
01:17:56,312 --> 01:17:58,355
What the fuck, man?

1213
01:17:59,482 --> 01:18:01,525
Oh, fuck.

1214
01:18:03,528 --> 01:18:07,114
All right. Okay. Okay.

1215
01:18:08,366 --> 01:18:10,075
Father!

1216
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:15,288
Get out! Now!

1217
01:18:23,506 --> 01:18:24,881
This is remarkable.

1218
01:18:25,049 --> 01:18:27,634
It looks like something
is emerging from the ground.

1219
01:18:27,802 --> 01:18:30,137
Something is definitely
coming out of the ground.

1220
01:18:30,304 --> 01:18:33,056
All right. All right.
Okay. Okay, steady.

1221
01:18:35,852 --> 01:18:37,811
Fuck it.

1222
01:18:41,524 --> 01:18:44,818
Go sit down. You can't play here now.
Your Uncle Wikus is flying.

1223
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:47,863
Uncle Wikus is flying now, all right?

1224
01:18:48,030 --> 01:18:49,448
Fuck. Fuck off.

1225
01:18:56,873 --> 01:18:59,708
- Hold your track on that target.
- Affirmative, colonel.

1226
01:18:59,876 --> 01:19:01,626
Fire when locked.

1227
01:19:04,714 --> 01:19:08,091
It seems to be drifting
towards the center of the territory.

1228
01:19:08,301 --> 01:19:09,843
- We have a lock.
- Fire!

1229
01:19:11,971 --> 01:19:14,681
Something has fired upon it.
Yes, it's been hit.

1230
01:19:15,141 --> 01:19:16,766
What the fuck is that?

1231
01:19:16,976 --> 01:19:20,020
One of the engines is
billowing smoke. It's out of control.

1232
01:19:20,563 --> 01:19:24,983
It's going down, boss. Should I
send the boys to fuck him up?

1233
01:19:28,154 --> 01:19:31,823
-- now, and -- And it's hit the ground.
A massive impact.

1234
01:19:31,991 --> 01:19:33,742
And it's come to a standstill.

1235
01:19:39,999 --> 01:19:41,082
My son!

1236
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:43,376
My son's in there!

1237
01:19:43,544 --> 01:19:47,380
Shut the fuck up! Get this fuck inside.
We're moving out. Come, let's go!

1238
01:19:47,548 --> 01:19:52,052
- Move him out. That's it.
- Move!

1239
01:19:52,261 --> 01:19:54,763
We're banking around,
trying to get a better view ...

1240
01:19:54,931 --> 01:19:56,556
of the ship, which is wrecked.

1241
01:19:56,724 --> 01:19:58,558
Waiting for some
of the smoke to clear.

1242
01:21:02,331 --> 01:21:04,499
Somebody has been pulled out
of the vehicle.

1243
01:21:04,667 --> 01:21:06,376
It looks like a human being.

1244
01:21:06,544 --> 01:21:09,379
We are getting unconfirmed reports
that this might be ...

1245
01:21:09,547 --> 01:21:12,465
Wikus van de Merwe,
a fugitive that has been on the run ...

1246
01:21:12,633 --> 01:21:14,926
from Multi-National United
for the past week.

1247
01:21:15,136 --> 01:21:19,681
They're loading him into
a vehicle now and heading off.

1248
01:21:24,103 --> 01:21:27,814
Battalion One to Control, confirming
prisoners are secured and traveling.

1249
01:21:28,024 --> 01:21:31,401
Expect delivery by 16:00 hours.

1250
01:21:46,375 --> 01:21:48,126
What the fuck?

1251
01:21:49,754 --> 01:21:51,421
Back up.

1252
01:21:57,345 --> 01:21:58,845
Watch out. Watch out.

1253
01:22:01,766 --> 01:22:03,099
We found him, boss.

1254
01:22:03,601 --> 01:22:04,643
Bring him to me.

1255
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:16,571
Get up. Move! Move!

1256
01:22:21,661 --> 01:22:24,329
- Take cover. Fall back.
- We need to regroup.

1257
01:22:25,748 --> 01:22:26,790
What the fuck?

1258
01:22:33,047 --> 01:22:34,756
Control, we're taking enemy fire.

1259
01:22:34,924 --> 01:22:37,509
We need support.
Backup. Backup now!

1260
01:22:42,848 --> 01:22:45,016
Fuck off! No, fuck off, man!

1261
01:22:55,486 --> 01:22:57,737
Get your hands off me.
Fucking get off me!

1262
01:23:01,742 --> 01:23:05,537
Get your fucking hands off me!
I'll fucking kill you.

1263
01:23:42,533 --> 01:23:44,409
Didn't I tell you ...

1264
01:23:44,577 --> 01:23:45,827
that I'm going to get you?

1265
01:23:45,995 --> 01:23:49,372
You came that day and left
with something that belongs to me.

1266
01:23:51,375 --> 01:23:52,751
Fuck you.

1267
01:24:00,885 --> 01:24:05,346
Fuck you. Fuck you! Fuck you!

1268
01:24:14,774 --> 01:24:16,441
Go, go, go.

1269
01:24:18,068 --> 01:24:19,736
Arriving at location. Over.

1270
01:24:25,993 --> 01:24:29,537
Additional troops
are moving into place.

1271
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:32,290
Go, go, go.

1272
01:24:32,875 --> 01:24:34,667
Kill them! Kill all of them!

1273
01:24:37,213 --> 01:24:38,296
Move it.

1274
01:24:38,464 --> 01:24:40,924
- Koobus!
- Cover the eastern block.

1275
01:24:42,426 --> 01:24:43,551
I told you ...

1276
01:24:44,136 --> 01:24:45,804
that the day would come.

1277
01:24:46,138 --> 01:24:49,057
You've been running around
with my prize.

1278
01:24:50,059 --> 01:24:53,895
All I want is to eat that arm
and become like you.

1279
01:24:54,063 --> 01:24:55,980
No, no, no. It won't work.

1280
01:24:58,484 --> 01:25:00,068
- Go, go, go.
- Move it.

1281
01:25:00,277 --> 01:25:01,986
Once I have that power ...

1282
01:25:02,363 --> 01:25:03,780
no one will stop me.

1283
01:25:03,989 --> 01:25:05,198
It was your turn ...

1284
01:25:06,408 --> 01:25:07,450
now it's mine.

1285
01:25:10,621 --> 01:25:13,998
With MNU security forces,
this armed faction is st --

1286
01:25:15,709 --> 01:25:16,876
It won't work.

1287
01:26:08,387 --> 01:26:10,138
Let's cut here.

1288
01:26:27,156 --> 01:26:38,082
Fuck.

1289
01:26:45,716 --> 01:26:49,719
We're getting reports of alien devices
activating throughout the city.

1290
01:26:49,887 --> 01:26:53,890
-- starting to work again
after 20 years --

1291
01:27:48,862 --> 01:27:50,488
- Pienaar?
- Yeah.

1292
01:27:50,698 --> 01:27:53,700
- See that prawn in the Casspir?
- Yeah.

1293
01:27:53,909 --> 01:27:56,202
He knows what the fuck
is up with that ship.

1294
01:27:56,412 --> 01:27:59,080
Get the fucker out
and get him talking now.

1295
01:28:00,916 --> 01:28:03,376
- Kronier.
- Cover.

1296
01:28:12,594 --> 01:28:16,264
-- contractors are closing in
on the Nigerian compound, and it --

1297
01:28:16,974 --> 01:28:21,894
Over here, cunt. Come outside,
you fucking alien. Come here.

1298
01:28:31,739 --> 01:28:34,824
What's your plan, huh?
What's your plan?

1299
01:28:38,787 --> 01:28:39,871
Move, move, move.

1300
01:28:57,765 --> 01:28:59,807
How are you doing that?

1301
01:29:00,309 --> 01:29:02,560
Who's moving that ship?

1302
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:07,398
All right. That's very comfort --

1303
01:29:07,566 --> 01:29:09,317
Fucking bliksem.

1304
01:29:11,779 --> 01:29:15,948
Wait for my command.
Make sure you fucking shoot to kill.

1305
01:29:22,539 --> 01:29:23,790
- Fall back.
- What the fuck?

1306
01:29:23,999 --> 01:29:26,125
Move it, move it.

1307
01:29:26,752 --> 01:29:30,129
Take the right flanks.
Take that fucker down.

1308
01:29:36,095 --> 01:29:39,180
Hold your fire.
Hold your fire and keep your positions.

1309
01:29:40,099 --> 01:29:41,974
It's van de Merwe.

1310
01:29:43,018 --> 01:29:45,103
Hey, Dickus.

1311
01:30:00,119 --> 01:30:03,454
You may have the prawn. Okay?
Just let me fucking go.

1312
01:30:03,622 --> 01:30:05,331
- Run, Wikus.
- You let me go.

1313
01:30:05,499 --> 01:30:07,291
- Run!
- You let me go.

1314
01:30:07,459 --> 01:30:12,547
And keep on running,
you fucking coward. Run! Run!

1315
01:30:12,714 --> 01:30:14,298
Control. This is Control.

1316
01:30:14,466 --> 01:30:18,386
Get the air support up
and get on his fucking tail now!

1317
01:30:18,554 --> 01:30:21,264
Copy that. Air support
is dispatching now. Over.

1318
01:30:21,431 --> 01:30:23,474
It's not gonna work, boss.

1319
01:30:23,642 --> 01:30:26,477
He's a tough one. He's not gonna talk.

1320
01:30:26,687 --> 01:30:28,771
Then just fucking kill him.

1321
01:30:43,537 --> 01:30:46,038
- He's not gonna talk.
- Then just fucking kill him.

1322
01:30:46,206 --> 01:30:47,248
Fuck.

1323
01:30:47,416 --> 01:30:51,502
- He's a tough one. He's not gonna talk.
- Then just fucking kill him.

1324
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:16,736
Hey. Come on.

1325
01:31:16,904 --> 01:31:19,322
I'll get you out of here.
I'll get you to the drop ship.

1326
01:31:19,489 --> 01:31:20,865
I can't, it's too far.

1327
01:31:21,033 --> 01:31:22,992
It's not too fucking far. Get up.

1328
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:25,995
I'm gonna get you there.
I'm gonna get you to your boy.

1329
01:31:26,163 --> 01:31:28,998
Come on. Stay behind me.
Stay behind me.

1330
01:31:39,176 --> 01:31:41,677
Retreat! Fall back! Fall back!

1331
01:31:41,887 --> 01:31:43,971
Fall back, fall back, fall back.

1332
01:31:45,974 --> 01:31:48,226
Come on, run, run, run. Go.

1333
01:31:52,814 --> 01:31:54,273
Arriving at location now.

1334
01:31:54,483 --> 01:31:56,359
We have clearance to engage.

1335
01:31:56,568 --> 01:31:59,237
It's coming towards us.
Get down, get down.

1336
01:32:02,908 --> 01:32:04,367
Take up positions to the east.

1337
01:32:04,534 --> 01:32:05,618
Go, guys. Go. Move.

1338
01:32:09,331 --> 01:32:13,376
JJ, go for point three.
Okay, go, go, go.

1339
01:32:16,171 --> 01:32:19,382
He's heading for the drop ship.
Cut those fuckers off!

1340
01:32:27,849 --> 01:32:28,891
What the fuck?

1341
01:32:35,274 --> 01:32:37,108
- Shit.
- You fuck.

1342
01:32:38,944 --> 01:32:39,986
Are you hurt?

1343
01:32:40,153 --> 01:32:45,283
No, we can make it. I think the ship's
stopping. We can make it. Come on.

1344
01:32:51,290 --> 01:32:54,208
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1345
01:33:01,967 --> 01:33:05,261
Listen, you go ahead.
You can make it.

1346
01:33:05,429 --> 01:33:09,640
I'm gonna just hold him off here
and I'll join you soon.

1347
01:33:09,808 --> 01:33:13,936
No, we stick together.
I'm not leaving you here.

1348
01:33:14,146 --> 01:33:16,731
Take your boy and go home.
You have to make it.

1349
01:33:16,898 --> 01:33:19,692
Don't make me go through this
and not make it. Understand?

1350
01:33:19,901 --> 01:33:22,570
I will come back for you.

1351
01:33:23,322 --> 01:33:25,948
Go. Go now before
I change my mind, man.

1352
01:33:26,158 --> 01:33:27,199
Go!

1353
01:33:27,367 --> 01:33:29,327
Three years, I promise.

1354
01:33:54,186 --> 01:33:56,937
Fuck! I'm not fucking scared of you.

1355
01:34:05,113 --> 01:34:06,280
Big fucking men.

1356
01:34:26,676 --> 01:34:28,052
Come on! Bring what you got!

1357
01:34:29,262 --> 01:34:31,055
Come on!

1358
01:34:53,412 --> 01:34:55,121
You want me? You want me?

1359
01:35:00,544 --> 01:35:01,669
Is that all you've got?

1360
01:35:04,214 --> 01:35:06,132
Is that all you've fucking got?

1361
01:35:09,553 --> 01:35:12,763
Some sort of quite extraordinary light
from the mother ship.

1362
01:35:12,931 --> 01:35:15,641
I've never seen anything like it.
It's a beam of li --

1363
01:35:21,857 --> 01:35:24,233
Select weapons.
Okay, fuck. Which one?

1364
01:35:24,401 --> 01:35:26,986
No, not that one. Go forward.
Forward scan. Okay.

1365
01:35:30,073 --> 01:35:31,574
Fire.

1366
01:35:59,060 --> 01:36:03,022
Report. Come in.

1367
01:36:03,190 --> 01:36:04,940
Get to the vehicle now. Get going.

1368
01:36:05,108 --> 01:36:06,442
- Yes, colonel.
- Go, go, go.

1369
01:36:16,203 --> 01:36:17,244
Fuck!

1370
01:36:31,968 --> 01:36:33,135
Fuck. Fuck.

1371
01:36:34,054 --> 01:36:36,847
You wanna fucking play with me,
Koobus?

1372
01:36:37,432 --> 01:36:39,558
You fucker!

1373
01:36:57,953 --> 01:36:59,453
He almost got me.

1374
01:37:00,330 --> 01:37:03,582
Go. Come on.

1375
01:38:40,513 --> 01:38:42,681
We go home now?

1376
01:38:43,642 --> 01:38:44,475
Yes.

1377
01:39:10,794 --> 01:39:12,920
Unbelievable.

1378
01:39:13,713 --> 01:39:16,256
Now I know why
everybody wants a piece of you.

1379
01:39:20,011 --> 01:39:22,513
I can't wait for those med boys
to cut you up.

1380
01:39:23,556 --> 01:39:28,394
But you know what? You're not gonna
waste any more of my time.

1381
01:39:28,603 --> 01:39:31,605
You half-breed piece of shit.

1382
01:39:33,066 --> 01:39:36,485
I'm gonna just fucking
kill you myself.

1383
01:39:44,744 --> 01:39:46,453
Stay back, you fucker.

1384
01:39:47,038 --> 01:39:48,247
Stay back.

1385
01:39:50,041 --> 01:39:52,000
Stay back!

1386
01:41:17,712 --> 01:41:20,464
And people everywhere
across Johannesburg ...

1387
01:41:20,632 --> 01:41:24,051
are flooding the streets,
are pouring out of their offices.

1388
01:41:24,219 --> 01:41:28,388
And all eyes are pointing up towards
the sky on this momentous day.

1389
01:41:28,556 --> 01:41:32,851
It's the first time, ladies and
gentlemen, in over two decades ...

1390
01:41:33,019 --> 01:41:35,479
that the mother ship has shown
any movement ...

1391
01:41:35,647 --> 01:41:37,523
and people are
tremendously excited.

1392
01:41:37,690 --> 01:41:40,734
The city has come
to an absolute standstill.

1393
01:41:40,902 --> 01:41:45,447
And everybody wants to know
what's going to happen next.

1394
01:41:45,615 --> 01:41:48,784
There's no way of knowing whether
Christopher Johnson will return.

1395
01:41:48,952 --> 01:41:53,705
We don't know if he was escaping,
whether he will effect a rescue plan ...

1396
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,210
and as the so-called
free press says ...

1397
01:41:58,378 --> 01:42:01,713
whether or not he'll come back
and declare war on us.

1398
01:42:26,781 --> 01:42:31,076
This is the last known footage
of Wikus van de Merwe.

1399
01:42:31,244 --> 01:42:36,123
And we can only speculate
as to what has happened to him.

1400
01:42:36,332 --> 01:42:40,460
The more zany conspiracy theories
state that ...

1401
01:42:40,628 --> 01:42:44,965
he's been captured by MNU
or by another government.

1402
01:42:45,133 --> 01:42:47,426
Or by perhaps some
shady government agency ...

1403
01:42:47,594 --> 01:42:50,345
and is actually being held
in captivity.

1404
01:42:50,555 --> 01:42:52,806
If we knew where he was,
we would help him.

1405
01:42:52,974 --> 01:42:56,602
And that is the most difficult part,
just not knowing where he is.

1406
01:42:56,811 --> 01:42:58,687
Wikus, sadly, is gone ...

1407
01:42:58,855 --> 01:43:03,692
but I'm the one who stays behind
with all the questions.

1408
01:43:03,860 --> 01:43:05,152
I can't give the answers.

1409
01:43:05,695 --> 01:43:08,864
He died in my mind a long time ago.

1410
01:43:09,282 --> 01:43:10,324
And that's that.

1411
01:43:10,533 --> 01:43:14,202
Wikus van de Merwe is a name
that will become very widely known ...

1412
01:43:14,370 --> 01:43:18,123
because of this pivotal role
that he played in this whole event.

1413
01:43:18,333 --> 01:43:21,418
He was an honest man and he
didn't deserve what happened.

1414
01:43:21,628 --> 01:43:25,339
I know. I looked into
the computer system and I found stuff.

1415
01:43:25,548 --> 01:43:28,967
I mean, the whole data was there,
you know?

1416
01:43:29,135 --> 01:43:31,428
They didn't even do a good job
of hiding it.

1417
01:43:49,864 --> 01:43:53,367
You guys haven't seen my wife.
Let me show you my wife.

1418
01:43:53,910 --> 01:43:55,619
She's my special angel.

1419
01:43:55,787 --> 01:43:58,872
She even looks like a angel
with a halo. You want to see?

1420
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:03,460
With the white veil over the head,
she even looks like an angel.

1421
01:44:03,628 --> 01:44:07,464
Everyone says his wife's an angel, but
this is a real angel that you're seeing.

1422
01:44:07,632 --> 01:44:10,717
On the cameras. They won't put that
in the video, I don't think.

1423
01:44:17,392 --> 01:44:22,646
I found this at my front door, as though
somebody had just left it there.

1424
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:28,360
My friends say I should throw it away
because it's just a piece of rubbish.

1425
01:44:30,113 --> 01:44:33,073
And it couldn't possibly
come from him.

1426
01:44:34,075 --> 01:44:36,284
I know it's true.
