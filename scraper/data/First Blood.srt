1
00:02:19,915 --> 00:02:23,970
Excuse me, can you tell me
this, where Delmare Berry lives?

2
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,340
He ain't here.

3
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,800
Go on inside, baby.

4
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,850
He's a friend of mine...

5
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,440
Well in fact, he wrote his
address down... right here.

6
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,240
Here.

7
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,860
You can see that's Delmare's writing.

8
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,990
I sure had a hard
time finding this place!

9
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,620
- That's his writin'.
- Like I said, he's a friend.

10
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:57,290
My name is John Rambo. We served
on the same team together in Nam.

11
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,750
I don't know if he
ever talked about me...

12
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,720
I've got a picture of us together.

13
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,050
Somewhere...

14
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,680
This junk in my pocket!

15
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,470
Here... here it is.

16
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,810
That's me, that's Danforth,
Westmore, Bronson, Ortega,

17
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,150
and there's Delmare, right in the back.

18
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,020
We had to put him in the
back because he's so big,

19
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,280
if we didn't, he'd take
up the whole picture!

20
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,780
Delmare's gone.

21
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,700
- What time will he be back?
- He died.

22
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,030
What?

23
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,000
Died last summer.

24
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,290
Died how?

25
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,290
Cancer. Brought it back from Nam.

26
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,800
All that orange stuff
they spread it around.

27
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,890
Cut him down to nothing. I
couldn't lift him off the sheet.

28
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,110
I'm very sorry.

29
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,370
Morning Amy! How are you doing, girls?

30
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,460
- Great, thanks.
- Alright this morning?

31
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,010
- Andy!
- Howdy, Will!

32
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,150
- Good morning, Dave!
- Hi, Sheriff!

33
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,230
Gonna take a bath this week?!

34
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,370
Morning!

35
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,330
You... you visiting someone around here?

36
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,920
No.

37
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,760
You know, wearing that flag on that
jacket, looking the way you do...

38
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,800
you're askin' for
trouble around here, friend!

39
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,060
- Headed North or South?
- North.

40
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:04,190
Jump in, I'll make sure you
head in the right direction, huh!

41
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,780
- Where you heading?
- Portland.

42
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,870
Portland is South, you said
you were headed North.

43
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,210
You got some place I
can eat around here?

44
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,000
There's a diner about
30 miles up the highway.

45
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,260
Is there a law against me
getting something to eat here?

46
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,550
Yeah, me.

47
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,310
Why are you pushin' me?

48
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,430
What did you say?

49
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,810
I said why are you pushing me,
I haven't done anything to you.

50
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,360
First of all, you don't ask the
questions around here, I do. Understand?

51
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:56,070
Secondly... we don't want
guys like you in this town.

52
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,490
Drifters.

53
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,990
First thing you know
we got a whole bunch

54
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,500
of guys like you in
this town. That's why!

55
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,000
Besides, you wouldn't like it here...

56
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,750
It's a quiet little town.

57
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,800
In fact, you might say it's boring!

58
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,510
But that's the way we like it.

59
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,390
And I get paid to keep it that way.

60
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,850
Boring...

61
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,320
Portland, straight ahead!

62
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,750
If you want some friendly advice...

63
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,960
Get your hair cut and take a bath.
You wouldn't get hassled so much!

64
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,250
Hope this ride helped you out!

65
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,510
Have a nice day, huh!

66
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,880
Where the hell do
you think you're going?

67
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,970
Hey, I'm talkin' to you, goddammit!

68
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,520
Let's see some I.D.!

69
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,900
All right, you're under arrest!

70
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,320
You hear me? You put
your hands on the car.

71
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,360
Now you put your hands on
the car, and you spread'em.

72
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,660
Are you gonna put
your hands on that car?

73
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,410
How you do it, you
decide, right now!

74
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,680
Put your legs back.

75
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,760
Back!

76
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,220
You try to be nice to some people!

77
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,480
Well, what do we have here, huh?

78
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,070
What would you be
carrying a knife like this?

79
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,990
Hunting.

80
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,160
Don't be a wise guy! What
do you hunt with a knife?

81
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,950
Name it.

82
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,540
- Hi, Will.
- Lester.

83
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,880
Harry, buzz us in, will ya?

84
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,720
Hey, talk about your
sorry looking humanity!

85
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,930
Just another smartass drifter.

86
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,810
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Will. What do you got?

87
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,270
I want you to book
this gentleman for

88
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:18,360
vagrancy, resisting arrest,
carrying a concealed weapon.

89
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,280
He says he uses it for hunting.

90
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,610
Huntin'? What do you hunt, elephants?

91
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:27,570
See if you can clean him up a
little. He smells like an animal!

92
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,120
Hey, Mitch... Mitch!

93
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,580
Yo!

94
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,670
Escort this young man downstairs.

95
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:38,960
Yes, sir.

96
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,800
Right this way, partner.

97
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:42,920
Right here.

98
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,800
That's it.

99
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,060
OK, here we go.

100
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,480
You know, it looks
like it'll take old Leroy

101
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,480
about 10 years to paint this hall!

102
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,900
Why don't you paint it your damned self?

103
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,820
Come on Leroy, sling that paint, boy!

104
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,570
Mr. Ward!

105
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,120
Would you take this for me, please?

106
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,540
Name?

107
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,880
Your name?

108
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,640
Your name!

109
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:35,680
Name!

110
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,860
Hey... you're lookin' to trouble?

111
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,400
You came at the right place, buddy!

112
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,030
Oh, wait a second.

113
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,410
You got three seconds
before I break your face in!

114
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,700
He means it.

115
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,620
Yeah, I do.

116
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:16,180
What do you know about that?
Old Harry here is a soldier!

117
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,190
Rambo...

118
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,900
John J.?

119
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,440
You're gonna talk to me.

120
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,950
I promise you're gonna
talk to me, soldier.

121
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,370
I'm starting to dislike you.

122
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,250
A lot.

123
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,290
I'm gonna run a make on him.

124
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,670
Put his name in the Teletype.

125
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,130
Just roll it across.

126
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,010
Roll it across!

127
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,850
Push it.

128
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,510
It won't work that way, it'll
only smear. Roll it across!

129
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,480
Look, you son of a
bitch, if you don't put your

130
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,810
goddamned hand down
there, I'm gonna break it off!

131
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:05,270
- Put it down, goddammit!
- Art, what the hell's going on down here?

132
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,440
Nothing I can't handle.

133
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,200
He won't let us print him well.

134
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,780
Leave the ink on your hand!

135
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,660
Just what is your problem, huh?

136
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,040
Listen, hardass! As
things stand right now,

137
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,620
you're facing the ass end
of a 90 day incarceration!

138
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:26,920
Plus a 250 dollars fine, which you
don't look to me like you can pay!

139
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,840
At 10 o'clock tomorrow morning,
you're going up in front of that judge.

140
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,930
And you think we're tough!

141
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,800
We're gonna make you
look more presentable

142
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,470
for your courtroom appearance.

143
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,060
Between now and then, you can
just impress the hell outta me

144
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,390
by doing exactly as you're told.

145
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,820
Clean him up.

146
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,950
All right, Preston,
I want you to go

147
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,660
over there and get that
hose ready, alright?

148
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,870
Holy shit, look at this!
What the hell's he been into?

149
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,710
Who gives a shit?

150
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,130
All right, put your hands on
top of your head and turn around.

151
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:16,930
Oh, Christ! We should report this
to Teasle, Gault! Look at that!

152
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,260
You just do what I tell you.

153
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,850
Gault, what the fuck was that?

154
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,900
Well, the Man said "clean him up".

155
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,700
Clean him up!

156
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:48,380
Hey, Preston, don't forget
to get him behind the ears!

157
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,590
How'd you like that, huh?

158
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:59,560
What's the matter, Mitch?
Don't you like water sports?

159
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:12,820
All right, hurry it up, it's time for
my coffee break. Alright, sit down!

160
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,030
Sit down!

161
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,460
Damn it, that boy's
hard to get a hold of!

162
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,080
That's OK, Ward, don't worry
about the soap, he's tough.

163
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,340
Just shave him. Dry!

164
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,170
All right...

165
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,880
How blind are you? Can't
you see this guy's crazy?

166
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,510
Can't you see I don't give a shit?

167
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,350
- Yeah, I can see that.
- Yeah, that's better.

168
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,180
See there, I knew that you...

169
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,100
We're just going to shave
you partner, take it easy!

170
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,480
Take this, Mitch.

171
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,650
Don't move...

172
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,780
I don't want you to cut your own throat!

173
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,420
You son of a bitch! Come on!

174
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,820
What the hell is...

175
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,030
Art! Art!

176
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,760
Hey, you can't...

177
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,290
I'm gonna kill this asshole!

178
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,540
Art, don't shoot!

179
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,500
Don't shoot, there's people down there!

180
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,670
All right, get help! I'll go after him!

181
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,590
Get outta the way!

182
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,190
Son of a bitch!

183
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,660
Lester, this is Will.
I'm right on his tail.

184
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,500
He's just east of Smith's farm,
headed towards Chapman Creek.

185
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,500
I know you can hear me!

186
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,960
You're finished!

187
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,460
You've gone as far as you're gonna go!

188
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,670
D'you hear me?

189
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:15,280
Mitch!

190
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:16,740
Lester!

191
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,080
He's up there behind the draw.

192
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,960
Mitch, get Orval on the radio.

193
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,540
Tell him to get out here with
his damned dogs right away.

194
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,590
And tell him to bring the Dobermen!

195
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,010
It's gonna rain, we'll need
dogs that can hunt on sight.

196
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,880
Lester, tell Paul to get
out to the lumber camp

197
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,340
to get the helicopter up here.

198
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,470
If they give him any shit, tell him to

199
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:40,270
site him for obstruction
right on the spot.

200
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:43,850
We'll get him!

201
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,810
No problem.

202
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,430
Go on, Hooch! Thunder, lets get him!

203
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,350
Come on, sweethearts!

204
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,520
Let's go get him, babies!

205
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,650
Won't be long before he's
stuffed and mounted, huh Will?

206
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,570
Make him into a bear rug!

207
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,360
Didn't we go hunting here up last year?

208
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,240
Yeah, I got a couple of bucks last year!

209
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,240
Hey Mitch, up the hill!

210
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,310
Get those hounds away from me,
Orval! I don't trust those bastards!

211
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:07,600
Keep moving, my dogs can
eat and run at the same time!

212
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,690
He's going straight to the top.

213
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,520
Isn't that supposed to be dangerous?

214
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,780
He's just dumb!

215
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:34,000
Hey, you're spoiling the scent.
Let my babies do their job!

216
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,680
- This is no good.
- Why?

217
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,760
There were three of us in
the cell block down there!

218
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,930
He went through us like
we weren't even there!

219
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,640
Oh, come on!

220
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,510
We've got him, go ahead, he's trapped!

221
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:05,050
Art, Art! This is Teasle, he's
heading for Chapman's gorge.

222
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,180
Chapman's gorge! Head him off!

223
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,340
There he is! On the cliff!

224
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,240
Son of a bitch!

225
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,870
What the hell's going on?

226
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:15,330
What are you doing? We're
just supposed to spot him!

227
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:19,710
- Hold it steady.
- I can't! We're in a thermal draft!

228
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:23,220
He's stuck there, he can't go any place.

229
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:29,300
If you don't ride this thing right,
I swear to God, I'll kill you!

230
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,100
Sheriff to Galt! Come in Galt.

231
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,900
Hold it steady, you son of a bitch!

232
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,570
Galt, come in, goddamn it!

233
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,860
Get closer and hold it steady!

234
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,320
Galt, talk to me, damn it! I
want to know what's going on!

235
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,620
I got him... easy now.

236
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,130
There he is!

237
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,800
Over there, dummy! Come on!

238
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,140
Hey, soldier boy!

239
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:14,120
Galt, I'm tellin' you to get on this
radio! What's going on up there?

240
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:19,330
I don't want him dead, Galt,
I want him alive! You hear me?

241
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,370
Art, come in!

242
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,560
Art Galt, come in!
Helicopter, come in, goddamn it!

243
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:24,810
Christ, look!

244
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,490
Jesus Christ, gimme the binoculars!

245
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,490
Oh no, no, no! Shit!

246
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,580
I can't figure it... How did he fall out?

247
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,880
Does it matter?

248
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,800
Let's nail this sucker's
ass... He can't be far!

249
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,090
Will!

250
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,720
Looks like he wants to turn himself in!

251
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:44,020
There's one man dead. It's not my
fault. I don't want any more hurt.

252
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,150
Freeze!

253
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:48,360
Stay right where you
are and give yourself up!

254
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,730
But I didn't do anything!

255
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,990
I'm warning you, boy, don't make
a move, I'll blow your head off!

256
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,530
I didn't do anything!

257
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,580
Cease fire! Cease fire!

258
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,750
Ward, goddamn it, cease fire!

259
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,500
I think we hit him. Let
us get down there. Move!

260
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,760
Sheriff to base, come in.

261
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:20,510
Go ahead, Will.

262
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,560
Lester, we're down in the gorge.

263
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,690
Galt's dead, alright? Where the
hell is that goddamned chopper?

264
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:30,230
He won't come, Will. Says
there's a storm heading your way.

265
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,730
I don't give a goddamned
what's on its way.

266
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,490
I want that chopper back here right now!

267
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,360
I don't want Gault's
body out here all night.

268
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,200
Listen, Will. You sure picked one
hell of a guy to mess around with!

269
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,790
Just came over the
Teletype a few minutes ago.

270
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,290
John Rambo is a Vietnam vet.

271
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:48,920
He's a Green Beret, Congressional
Medal of Honor! Guy's a war hero!

272
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,790
Jesus, that freak?!

273
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:53,130
I knew there was
something about that guy!

274
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,010
I double checked it, Will.
What do you want me to do?

275
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,970
I want you to do what I
told you to do, goddamn it!

276
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:06,480
Get that chopper back here now! Out.

277
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,810
Green Beret!

278
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:14,400
War hero!

279
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:17,190
- That's great! That's just great!
- Shut your mouth!

280
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,450
What the hell's the
matter with you guys?

281
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,870
He's one man... wounded!

282
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:26,500
Those Green Berets... they're
real bad asses.

283
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,830
Why don't you let the
State Police handle this?

284
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,970
Look. Look at him... look at
him! That's Art Gault, boy!

285
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,890
He and I were friends when your

286
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:45,260
momma was still wiping your nose!

287
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:49,350
Now he's dead. He's dead!
Because of that psycho out there!

288
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,730
Now you listen boy,
you listen to me good:

289
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,310
I'm gonna get that son of a bitch...

290
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:55,730
and I'm gonna pin that Congressional
Medal of Honor to his liver!

291
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,190
And I'm gonna do it,

292
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:01,320
with you, or without you!

293
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,800
We're closin' in, the
scent's getting stronger.

294
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,890
All right, keep your eyes open!

295
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,930
It's gonna storm... it's all we need now!

296
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:33,560
Will, c'mon, let's get out of
here before it gets too dark.

297
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,480
What's the matter, you
afraid of the boogie man?

298
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,860
You goddamned pansy!

299
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,450
Put your gun down, I'll
show you who the pansy is!

300
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,910
Knock it off! Ward! Ward, move out!

301
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:48,540
The fight is out here! He's
out there waiting for you.

302
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,290
Mitch, get on your feet and move!

303
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,420
Go find this guy for Chrissakes!
Keep your eyes open!

304
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,050
- I'll see you later, Ward!
- Shut up, Mitch.

305
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:08,970
There he is!

306
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,560
Let them dogs loose, Orval!

307
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,440
Go get him sweethearts!
Here's your dinner!

308
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,370
Cease fire!

309
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,540
Goddammit, I'm hit!

310
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,790
Jesus, he's got a gun..

311
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,510
It's not him, it's a
goddamned scarecrow!

312
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,430
No scarecrow that
shot Orville, he's close.

313
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,060
Kill him! Go get him!

314
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,320
Go get him, Maggie!

315
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,960
Mitch, Ward, come here!
Shingleton, you cover us.

316
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,710
Look at his leg!

317
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,380
Mitch, get your belt. Make
a tourniquet around that.

318
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,380
We got to get this guy to a doctor!

319
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,840
Goddamnit, get your belt on that
fast! Where's the first-aid kit?

320
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,880
I left it in the car.

321
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:27,930
Shit!

322
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,720
- Where did he get that gun?
- It's gotta be Art Gault's gun.

323
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:32,850
- He's outta ammo...
- How do you know that?

324
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,730
Because whatever killed Orval's
dog was no bullet, that's how!

325
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,560
Hurry up! Orval, listen
to me, now listen!

326
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,440
You have to stay awake, all right?

327
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,820
You have to release that
tourniquet every 15 minutes.

328
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,820
We'll be right back! We go
get him now, he's outta ammo.

329
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,910
Get him! He had no right to shoot
my babies. Get the son of a bitch!

330
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,450
- Let's go!
- Go get him!

331
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:56,080
All right, now listen up!

332
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,790
We're right on top of him.

333
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,880
We're gonna form a
skirmish line, 50 feet apart.

334
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,340
Keep moving, there's no way
outta here, except through us.

335
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,380
OK, let's do some huntin'...

336
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:12,050
Huntin'? We ain't
huntin' him, he's huntin' us!

337
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,990
Spread out. Spread out,
dammit! I said 50 feet!

338
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:56,390
I hate this!

339
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,550
Will, it's Mitch!

340
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,020
Who is it?

341
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,340
- What's goin' on?
- Shut up!

342
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,510
He's got Ward. Spread
out, I'll go this way.

343
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,560
Will! Over here!

344
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,150
Who's firing?

345
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,910
Who's firing?

346
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,240
I got him!

347
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,370
Shingleton, follow me!

348
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,330
Will, help me!

349
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,670
Help me, Will!

350
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,430
Balford? Where the hell are you?!

351
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:50,560
Shingleton, over here!

352
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:09,250
Shingleton, where the hell are you?!

353
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:36,820
I could have killed'em all.
I could have killed you.

354
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:40,240
In town you're the law,
out here, it's me!

355
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:45,950
Don't push it! Don't push it, or I'll
give you a war you won't believe!

356
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,250
Let it go.

357
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,460
Let it go.

358
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,350
Move back, you guys, move back!

359
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,490
How bad is the situation?
Captain, we need some...

360
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:02,990
That's the only good thing about this,

361
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:04,570
is the business you're doing in town!

362
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:07,490
Reporters are drinking the place dry.

363
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:12,080
You look like you're
ready to keel over, Will.

364
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:15,130
Why don't you go
home? It's my problem now.

365
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:17,750
Your problem? Listen Dave,
don't give me any of your

366
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:20,550
horsehit about jurisdiction
in this one, you understand?

367
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,880
- Should I step outside?
- Just finish up what you're doing.

368
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:28,850
Somewhere in this rugged mountain
countryside, possibly above the snow line,

369
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,100
shrouded in mist, the
fugitive John Rambo, is hiding.

370
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:34,520
Units of the state
police along with local

371
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:38,570
members of the National
Guard are now being mobilized.

372
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:41,650
What still remains
unexplained by local authorities

373
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:43,570
is just how and where
the former Green Beret

374
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,280
came into possession of the weapons

375
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,200
with which he allegedly
killed one deputy sheriff,

376
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,910
and tried to kill 6 others.

377
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:52,160
Only their skilled training
in police enforcement

378
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,040
techniques saved their lives.

379
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,040
And word now is that
the fugitive will be

380
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,170
in custody in a matter of hours.

381
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:01,460
Maps, Will.

382
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,340
Will, there's something
I think you oughta know.

383
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:07,800
I'll talk to you later, OK?

384
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,430
What is it, Lester? What is it
for Christ sake, spit it out!

385
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:16,850
Well, I was just talkin' to
Mitch, and he was sayin' that

386
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:20,770
Gault and a couple of deputies
were... a little hard on the guy.

387
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,360
Assholes!

388
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:26,820
It doesn't make one goddammed bit
of difference, Dave, and you know it!

389
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:32,950
If one of my deputies... gets
outta line with a prisoner,

390
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:34,330
then the prisoner
comes to me with it!

391
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,330
And if I find out it's like he
says, I kick the deputy's ass!

392
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,840
Me, the law! That's
the way it's gotta be.

393
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,090
People start fuckin' around with
the law, and all hell breaks loose.

394
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,220
Whatever possessed God in
heaven to make a man like Rambo?

395
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:52,310
God didn't make Rambo.

396
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:54,930
I made him.

397
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,520
Who the hell are you?

398
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,940
Sam Trautman. Colonel Samuel Trautman.

399
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:03,480
We're a little busy this morning,
Colonel, what can I do for ya?

400
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,400
- I've come to get my boy.
- Your boy?

401
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:09,990
I recruited him, I trained him, I
commanded him in Vietnam for 3 years.

402
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,240
I'd say that makes him mine.

403
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:14,790
I wonder why the Pentagon would

404
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:17,870
send a full bird Colonel to handle this?

405
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:20,830
The army thought I
might be able to help.

406
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,670
I don't know in what way.

407
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:24,460
Rambo's a civilian now, he's my problem.

408
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:30,090
I don't think you understand. I didn't
come here to rescue Rambo from you.

409
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,390
I came here to rescue you from him.

410
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:36,100
Well, we all appreciate
your concern, Colonel.

411
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:38,390
We'll try to be extra careful!

412
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:42,020
I'm just amazed he allowed
any of your posse to live.

413
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:43,820
Is that right?

414
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:47,650
Strictly speaking, he slipped up.
You're lucky to be breathing!

415
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:48,700
That's just great!

416
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,120
Colonel, you came out here

417
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,830
to find out why one of
your machines blew a gasket!

418
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:56,450
You don't seem to want to
accept the fact that you're

419
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:59,080
dealing with an expert
in guerilla warfare.

420
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,130
With a man who's the best.

421
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,840
With guns, with knives,
with his bare hands.

422
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:08,380
A man who's been trained to
ignore pain, ignore weather.

423
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,260
To live off the land...

424
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,640
To eat things that would
make a billy goat puke.

425
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,930
In Vietnam, his job was to dispose
of enemy personnel, to kill... period!

426
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:23,900
Win by attrition. Well,
Rambo was the best!

427
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,410
OK, Colonel, now you've
got us all scared to death.

428
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:24,790
What do you and the Special Forces think

429
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,170
I oughta do about your psycho out there?

430
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,050
Let him go.

431
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,800
- Do what?
- For now.

432
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,220
Defuse the whole situation, defuse him.

433
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:38,350
Provide a little gap and
let him slip through it.

434
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:41,730
Then put out a nation wide
APB. In a couple of weeks,

435
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:44,520
you'll pick him up in Seattle or
someplace, working in a car wash.

436
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,020
There'll be no fight and
nobody else will get hurt.

437
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,610
I do my own work. I don't
figure the best way to do that is

438
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:51,320
to close my eyes and then hope
he gets picked up in Seattle!

439
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:54,240
If you send your people in
there after him, they'll get killed!

440
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,950
You know, we're just a small
hick town Sheriff's department,

441
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:59,030
Colonel, but we're
expected to do our duty

442
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,160
just like our heroes
in the Special Forces.

443
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:04,620
In Special Forces, we teach our
people to stay alive in the line of duty.

444
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:06,630
No shit, I never thought of that!

445
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:07,710
You want a war you can't win?

446
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:12,010
Are you tellin' me that 200 men against
your boy is a no win situation for us?

447
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,010
You send that many,
don't forget one thing.

448
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:15,010
What?

449
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,010
A good supply of body-bags!

450
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,720
Trautman!

451
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,350
I don't know which side
you're on, Trautman...

452
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:29,440
I still think you came out
here just to cover your ass.

453
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:33,940
But if you're serious about taking
Rambo out clean, follow me...

454
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:58,470
State police calling John
Rambo. Acknowledge.

455
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:09,860
State police calling John Rambo.
Come in please. Acknowledge!

456
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:15,490
If you're listening, Rambo, here's
your situation: you are surrounded.

457
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:18,280
Every possible exit has been blocked,

458
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,870
every highway, every
road, every fire break.

459
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,790
You have our word that
your services to your

460
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:24,540
country will be taken
into consideration.

461
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,290
And you'll receive fair treatment.

462
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:29,670
Just respond, we can
work everything out... over.

463
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,290
Anything?

464
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,550
- He took a radio off one of my deputies.
- Then he has to be listening.

465
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:37,550
If I was in his position,
I'd try to pick up

466
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:39,930
some information. Maybe
catch some cross talk.

467
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:41,300
Of course, he's listening.

468
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:43,010
He's not gonna break radio silence.

469
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:46,140
No, not for us, but he
might do it for you, Colonel.

470
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:48,350
He's your boy, isn't he?

471
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:54,860
Maybe you can talk him into sparing
all our lives by giving himself up.

472
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:56,860
I can try.

473
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,820
At least, we'd get a
radio fix on his position,

474
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:01,280
if you don't mind
setting him up for us...

475
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,740
Setting him up for you?

476
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:05,330
It's like bringing the
pigeons to the cat!

477
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:12,880
Thanks for bringing your people out.

478
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,840
Any time, Will.

479
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,050
C'mon, Bobby, put the
magazine away, will ya?

480
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:18,720
Pay attention. I mean we
may only get one crack at this.

481
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:26,890
Company leader calling
Raven. Come on Raven.

482
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:31,230
Company leader calling Raven.

483
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:38,900
Company leader to
Raven. Talk to me, Johnny.

484
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,410
Company leader to identify Baker Team:

485
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:48,870
Rambo, Messner, Ortega, Coletta,

486
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,630
Jorgensen, Danforth, Berry, Krakauer.

487
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:55,170
Confirm.

488
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:57,340
This is Colonel Trautman.

489
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:00,880
Talk to me, Johnny.

490
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:17,690
They're all gone, Sir.

491
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:21,950
- That's him, get on it.
- Rambo. Are you alright? Over.

492
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:23,780
Baker team, they're all dead, Sir.

493
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,870
Not Delmare Berry, he made it.

494
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:29,950
Berry's gone too, Sir.

495
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:32,330
How?

496
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,750
Got himself killed in Nam...

497
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,250
Didn't even know it. Cancer
ate him down to the bone.

498
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:41,380
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

499
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:44,260
I'm the last one, Sir.

500
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:48,180
It's good to hear your voice,
Johnny. It's been a long time!

501
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,680
Look, John, you've
done some damage here,

502
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,690
but they don't want any more trouble.

503
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,150
He's north-west!

504
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:57,270
That's why I've come.

505
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,190
I'm gonna come in
and fly you the hell out.

506
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:04,150
Just you and me. We'll work this
out together. Is that fair enough?

507
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,450
Where'd you come from, Sir?

508
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:07,910
Bragg.

509
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,830
I tried to get in touch with you,

510
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:13,040
but the guys at Bragg
never knew where to find you.

511
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,420
Well, I haven't been spending
much time there lately,

512
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:18,540
they've got me down in DC.
I'm shining a seat with my ass.

513
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:21,000
I wish I was back in Bragg now.

514
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:25,840
We'll talk about that when you come in.

515
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,510
I can't do that, Sir.

516
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,890
Well, look, John, we can't have
you running around out there,

517
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,350
wasting friendly civilians.

518
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:37,940
- There are no friendly civilians.
- I'm your friend, Johnny.

519
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:41,360
I was there with you, knee
deep in blood and guts.

520
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,190
I covered your ass more than once!

521
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,530
Seems like bailing you out of trouble

522
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:50,200
is becoming a lifetime job for me!

523
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:53,040
There wouldn't be no trouble
except for that king shit cop!

524
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,500
All I wanted was something to eat.

525
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,750
But the man kept pushin', Sir.

526
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:01,630
Well, you did some
pushin' on your own, John!

527
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:04,260
They drew first blood, not me.

528
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:05,300
Look Johnny...

529
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,430
Let me come in, and get
you the hell outta there.

530
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:12,600
They drew first blood...

531
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:23,190
Rambo! Are you still reading me?

532
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:29,660
Company leader to Raven!

533
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:32,240
Rambo, acknowledge!

534
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:35,330
He's all finished, Colonel!

535
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,330
We've got a real good fix on him now.

536
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:41,250
Come first light, I'm gonna put
every man I got upon that ridge.

537
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:43,710
Then we'll get him my way!

538
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:51,180
Goddammit.

539
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:53,720
Goddammit!

540
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,780
Come on, move it!

541
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:08,490
Let's go!

542
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:12,240
Does this guy got a gun?

543
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:24,440
There's the guy the
cops are shootin' at!

544
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,440
I see him over there,
I'll get him, I'll get him!

545
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,150
Don't shoot!

546
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,490
This way! Let's go!

547
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:39,870
There he is! Come on!

548
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,970
Now we got him!

549
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:05,690
Yes, I know exactly where it is.
Now listen to me very carefully.

550
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:08,360
Surround the area with every
man you've got, but don't move in.

551
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,730
I repeat: don't move in!

552
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:12,650
Don't do anything till I get
there! And no shooting!

553
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:14,450
I don't want him dead, I want him alive!

554
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:34,130
Keep firing!

555
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:38,100
Come on guys, shoot!

556
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:41,220
Come on!

557
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:44,770
You guys are great!

558
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:47,020
- All right, Steve.
- Yo!

559
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,810
I want you and Bruce,
head around these trees,

560
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:49,940
go to the front of that mine.

561
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,980
Screw that Clint, but
I ain't goin' up there!

562
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:52,900
No way!

563
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:58,870
- Brandon?
- What?

564
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:02,540
- I want you to go into that mine.
- No, not me!

565
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:03,500
What do you mean, not me?!

566
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:06,210
Look, I do this part time, I
didn't come here to get killed.

567
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:09,130
He's probably just waitin' for us!

568
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:10,540
What's wrong with you, Clinton?

569
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:19,090
Rambo! This is
Lieutenant Clinton Morgan.

570
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:21,560
National Guard leader.

571
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:27,480
And I'm giving you just
3.0 seconds to come on out.

572
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,520
Who's got the rocket launcher?

573
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:33,480
- I do.
- Come here, Earl.

574
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:34,400
Right!

575
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,990
Rambo! This is your
last chance to come out.

576
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,910
Maybe we should wait.

577
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:44,830
Earl, this creep is a killer!

578
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:47,500
Besides, I'm in charge
and I say we blow it up!

579
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:51,460
Now fire that thing! Just let
me get outta the way first.

580
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:18,400
Give that man a cigar!

581
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:20,410
Bull's eye!

582
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:03,620
- Where the hell are they?
- Up the hill about 500 yards.

583
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,660
Move in a little closer,
just like Iwa Jima.

584
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:13,830
I don't believe it! Idiots!

585
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:17,130
All right, one more for
"Soldier of Fortune"!

586
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:18,260
Soldier of Fortune?!

587
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,840
Dammit, what the hell do you
think this is, some kind of a circus?

588
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:23,300
Get the hell outta here!

589
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:26,260
Clinton, Jesus!

590
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:28,770
Didn't you get the word, Clinton?

591
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:30,730
I told you people to
wait until I got up here!

592
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:32,140
Well, he was shooting at us, Will!

593
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:34,440
Come on! I wasn't taking any chances.

594
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:38,070
What a mess!

595
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,820
We have to dig his body
out of there right away.

596
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:45,660
You can't get a dozer up here,

597
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,530
you're gonna have to find
somebody to dig him out!

598
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:49,540
It's your mess, Clinton!
You clean it up.

599
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:52,580
Will, come on... I gotta be back
at the drug store tomorrow!

600
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:55,130
You'd better get started
right away, Clinton!

601
00:59:58,250 --> 00:59:59,300
Shit!

602
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,930
Buried in a hole by a bunch of
goddamned weekend warriors!

603
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:50,010
Thought you said he was
the best you ever trained!

604
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:52,310
However he may have ended up,

605
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:54,140
there was a time when
he was very special.

606
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,520
'Special', my ass! He was just
another drifter that broke the law.

607
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,060
Vagrancy, wasn't it?

608
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,400
That's gonna look real good on
his gravestone in Arlington:

609
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:06,530
"Here lies John Rambo, winner of
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

610
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:09,990
Survivor of countless
incursions behind enemy lines.

611
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:13,620
Killed for vagrancy,
in 'Jerkwater', USA.

612
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:16,370
Don't give me any of
that crap, Trautman!

613
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:20,590
You think Rambo was the only guy
who had a tough time in Vietnam?

614
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:23,380
He killed a police
officer, for Christ sake!

615
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:25,260
You're goddamned lucky
he didn't kill all of you...

616
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:44,990
This character! He
comes waltzing in here,

617
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:46,570
full of all kinds of good advice.

618
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:49,620
And wished we'd let that
goddamned maniac go on the loose,

619
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:50,870
so we could save our own asses!

620
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:54,240
Well, we saved our asses, Colonel!
And we didn't let him go on the loose.

621
01:01:54,790 --> 01:01:59,080
The best man lost!
And he doesn't like it!

622
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,890
- How you doin', Will?
- Hold my calls.

623
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:56,740
Colonel?

624
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:02,240
Have a seat.

625
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:11,000
Oh miss, can you do this again, please?

626
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,500
- Oh sure!
- And for my friend...?

627
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:16,510
A shot of wild turkey.

628
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:23,060
If I was out of line before,
I just want to apologize.

629
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:27,390
None of that makes much
difference now, does it?

630
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:30,690
No, I guess not.

631
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:35,230
I suppose...

632
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,780
I just feel...

633
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,740
Like you were... cheated
outta your chance?

634
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:46,120
I wanted to kill that kid.

635
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,870
I wanted to kill him so
bad, I could taste it.

636
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:53,500
Doesn't sit well with that badge.

637
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:57,170
It can get confusing sometimes...

638
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:01,470
In Vietnam, you can bet that Rambo and

639
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:05,510
I got pretty confused. But we had orders.

640
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,060
When in doubt... kill!

641
01:07:13,310 --> 01:07:14,860
But what the hell, you're a civilian.

642
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:17,610
You can go home to your wife,

643
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:19,240
and your house and
your little flower garden.

644
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:21,610
You're under no pressure
to figure all this out.

645
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:22,610
And what about you, Colonel?

646
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:24,160
What did you figure
out from all of this, huh?

647
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,370
I mean what would you have
done with him if he came in?

648
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:30,120
Would you wrap your arms
around him to give a big sloppy kiss?

649
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:32,540
Or would you have blown his brains out?

650
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:44,090
I couldn't answer that
until I met him face to face.

651
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:49,220
Well, there it is.

652
01:07:50,850 --> 01:07:54,440
Just as well we never
got a chance to find out.

653
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:46,680
Drive!

654
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:53,270
Don't look at me, look at the road.
That's how accidents happen!

655
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:57,440
- What's your name?
- Cathcart, Robert A.

656
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,730
All right, what do you
got in the back, Robert A.?

657
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:01,820
M60.

658
01:10:05,190 --> 01:10:08,240
- OK, Robert A., get out of the truck.
- I don't got no beef with you!

659
01:10:09,490 --> 01:10:10,490
Go home! Move, go home!

660
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,060
Want to turn that up?

661
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,730
What's your story, Steamboat?

662
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:46,570
Looks like somebody
pulled the plug too soon...

663
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:49,530
That Rambo guy? He's on the loose again!

664
01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:50,570
Shit!

665
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:57,120
Hey Will, it's Rambo! He's still around!

666
01:14:39,010 --> 01:14:42,550
- Holy fuck!
- Get out there right away. Move!

667
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:09,670
What the hell is going on?!

668
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:15,380
- Watch yourselves!
- They're all gonna blow!

669
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:27,850
Attention, all civilians!

670
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:32,810
For your own safety, please
evacuate the streets immediately.

671
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:37,400
Remain indoors until you
receive further instructions.

672
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:40,240
I repeat: this is a police emergency.

673
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,990
Please evacuate the streets immediately.

674
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:03,550
They found Rambo's body...

675
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:07,220
As a matter of fact,
he stole an army truck

676
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:09,680
and blew up a gas station
on the other side of town.

677
01:16:10,430 --> 01:16:11,890
The kid is resilient.

678
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:15,560
Why don't you forget what you're
thinking and clear out while you can?

679
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,610
Get the fuck outta here, Trautman!
You take your advice with you.

680
01:16:19,690 --> 01:16:21,400
When I talked to you
earlier this afternoon,

681
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:24,070
you knew he was still alive, didn't you?

682
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:26,950
I suspected it.

683
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:32,250
Sure... Sure, that's why you
stuck around. You trained him.

684
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:35,000
You taught him how to get
out of places like that cave.

685
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,880
But he's not gonna
get out of this place!

686
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,800
Teasle, you and all your men
couldn't handle him before,

687
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,630
what makes you think
you can handle him now?

688
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,760
Because God knows what
damage he's prepared to do.

689
01:16:57,820 --> 01:16:59,320
You're gonna die, Teasle.

690
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:01,650
Everybody dies!

691
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:05,110
There's only one man in this
room that has half a chance.

692
01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:07,030
That's not because
I'm better than he is.

693
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:09,030
But it's because he trusts me.

694
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:11,500
See, I'm the closest thing
to family that he has left,

695
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:13,960
and that may be all the edge I need.

696
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:16,670
Jesus Christ, where do
you people come from?

697
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:24,680
This is my job Trautman,
this is my town!

698
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:28,550
And I'm not giving it up to you,
or to Rambo or anybody else!

699
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:32,430
Now you just stay the hell outta my way!

700
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:43,820
- Get a little closer!
- I can't!

701
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:45,280
It's too goddamned hot!

702
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,030
Will, it's Lester, do you copy, over?

703
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:54,290
Come on, let's go! Will, this
is Lester, do you copy, over?

704
01:17:55,500 --> 01:18:00,500
Listen Will, we've got some serious
problems. The highway's been cut off.

705
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:03,800
The truck's out here, but
we couldn't find the body.

706
01:18:04,210 --> 01:18:05,800
I repeat: no body,
it's totally burnt out.

707
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,760
Preston, get those people outta here!

708
01:18:08,970 --> 01:18:10,800
Move them back to the south side.

709
01:18:12,510 --> 01:18:17,350
We don't know how many gas
tanks there are under the pumps...

710
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,960
Go ahead... go ahead!

711
01:24:12,710 --> 01:24:14,750
Go ahead, you crazy
son of a bitch, finish me!

712
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:15,880
Rambo!

713
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:18,420
Rambo, don't do it!

714
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:20,720
Listen to me, Rambo!

715
01:24:21,010 --> 01:24:22,050
You have no chance.

716
01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:24,550
Drop your weapon.

717
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:29,600
We're gonna order a chopper
in and fly you back to Bragg.

718
01:24:31,890 --> 01:24:32,980
Hold your fire!

719
01:24:37,690 --> 01:24:38,610
Hold your fire!

720
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:40,690
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

721
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:43,280
Think about what you're doin'.

722
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:48,580
The building's perimeter's
covered. No exits.

723
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:51,960
There's nearly 200 men
out there and a lot of M16s!

724
01:24:52,410 --> 01:24:54,630
You did everything to make
this private war happen.

725
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,800
You've done enough damage!

726
01:24:58,250 --> 01:25:00,510
This mission is over, Rambo.
Do you understand me?

727
01:25:01,970 --> 01:25:03,130
This mission is over!

728
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:08,060
Look at 'em out there.

729
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:12,350
Look at 'em!

730
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,230
If you won't end this
happen, they'll kill you!

731
01:25:18,770 --> 01:25:20,190
Is that what you want?

732
01:25:23,610 --> 01:25:26,410
It's over, Johnny. It's OVER!

733
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:31,410
Nothing is over! Nothing!
You just don't turn it off!

734
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:35,460
It wasn't my war. You
asked me, I didn't ask you!

735
01:25:36,290 --> 01:25:39,460
And I did what I had to do to win,
but someone wouldn't let us win.

736
01:25:40,050 --> 01:25:42,510
And I come back to
the world, and I see all

737
01:25:42,510 --> 01:25:45,220
those maggots at the
airport, protestin' me, spittin'.

738
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:48,180
Callin' me baby killer
and all kinds of vile crap!

739
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:52,140
Who are they to protest
me, huh? Who are they?

740
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:53,890
Unless they've been me and been there,

741
01:25:53,890 --> 01:25:55,560
and know what the
hell they're yellin' about?

742
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:59,020
It was a bad time for everyone,
Rambo. It's all in the past now.

743
01:25:59,060 --> 01:26:01,690
FOR YOU! For me,
civilian life is nothing.

744
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,070
In the field, we had a code of honor.

745
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:07,570
You watch my back, I watch
yours. Back here, there's nothing!

746
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:11,620
You're the last of an elite
group... don't end it like this.

747
01:26:11,620 --> 01:26:14,250
Back there I could fly a
gunship, I could drive a tank,

748
01:26:14,330 --> 01:26:16,290
I was in charge of a
million dollar equipment!

749
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:19,540
Back here, I can't even
hold a job parking cars!

750
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:30,680
Where is everybody?

751
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:39,560
I had a friend, who
was in the Air Force.

752
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:45,610
There were all these guys, man.
Back there were all these fuckin guys!

753
01:26:46,110 --> 01:26:47,740
Who were my friends!

754
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:50,990
Back here, there's nothing!
Remember Dan Forest?

755
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:53,450
Wore this black headband.

756
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:55,750
I took one of his magic
markers, and I said:

757
01:26:55,830 --> 01:26:58,330
"If found, you mail this to Las Vegas",

758
01:26:58,330 --> 01:27:00,080
'cause we were always
talkin' about Vegas,

759
01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:03,800
and this fuckin' car. This so
great '58 Chevy convertible!

760
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,170
He was talkin' about his car,

761
01:27:05,170 --> 01:27:08,220
he said we'd get cruised
till the tires fell off!

762
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:18,310
We were in this bar in
Saigon, and this kid comes up,

763
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:21,020
this kid carrying a shoe shine box.

764
01:27:21,190 --> 01:27:23,820
And there, he says:
"Shine please, shine!"

765
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:27,530
I said no, and he kept askin',
yeah, and Joe would say 'yeah'.

766
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:29,860
And... I went to get a couple of beers.

767
01:27:30,570 --> 01:27:33,620
And the box was wired.
He opened up the box...

768
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:35,910
Fucking blew his
body all over the place.

769
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:38,620
He's laying there and
he's fucking screaming,

770
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:40,170
there's pieces of him all over me!

771
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:45,550
And I'm trying to pull them off, you
know... my friend! It's all over me!

772
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:47,670
I got blood and everything and...

773
01:27:47,670 --> 01:27:50,220
I'm trying to hold him
together, I put him together

774
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:52,220
the fucking entrails keep coming out!

775
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:54,510
And nobody would help!

776
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:59,060
He's saying, sayin', "I want to
go home!" just calling my name.

777
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,230
"I wanna go home, Johnny,
I wanna drive my Chevy!"

778
01:28:02,230 --> 01:28:04,440
I said: "Why I can't
find your fuckin' legs. "

779
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:06,860
"I can't find your legs!"

780
01:28:08,610 --> 01:28:13,240
I can't get it out of my
head. It was seven years.

781
01:28:13,740 --> 01:28:15,240
Every day it hurts.

782
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:21,540
Sometimes I wake up and don't know
where I am. I don't talk to anybody.

783
01:28:22,370 --> 01:28:24,250
Sometimes a day.

784
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:27,840
Sometimes a week.

785
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:31,680
I can't put it outta my mind...
