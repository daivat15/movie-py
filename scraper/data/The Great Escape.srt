00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,567
Go inside.

3
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,645
Hurry up.

4
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,647
This way.

5
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,128
Hurry up.

6
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,530
Yeah, this'll do.
Which one are you gonna have?

7
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,720
- l...
- No, that's mine.

8
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,000
<i>Alllz</i> hup!

9
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,045
How far are the trees, Danny?

10
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,525
Over 200 feet.

11
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,368
Yeah, l'd say 300.

12
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,560
Long ways to dig.

13
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,524
We'll get Cavendish to make a survey.
l wish Big X were here.

14
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,406
Willie, you think X got away?

15
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,600
He'd have sent us word
somehow if he had.

16
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,722
- Gestapo, you think?
- Either that or he's dead.

17
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,441
- Group Captain Ramsey?
- Yes.

18
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:31,643
l am Hauptfeldwebel Strachwitz.
Will you accompany me, please?

19
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,284
- l'll look after your gear, sir.
- Right.

20
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,927
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.

21
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,688
Good morning, Group Captain.

22
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:56,360
l'm Captain Posen, Von Luger's adjutant.
Since you're senior British officer,

23
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,278
you are to be liaison between
the prisoners and the colonel.

24
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,287
He wishes to make clear to you
certain matters of...

25
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,401
the word is ''policy''?

26
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,724
Yes.

27
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,727
Thank you.

28
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,727
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.

29
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,365
l am Colonel Von Luger. Please sit down.

30
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,201
Group Captain Ramsey,
in the past four years

31
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,402
the Reich has been forced to spend
an enormous amount of time,

32
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,361
energy, manpower and equipment

33
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,119
hunting down escaping
prisoner-of-war officers.

34
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,162
At least it's rather nice
to know you're wanted, isn't it?

35
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:57,205
For us it's not a matter for levity.
There will be no escapes from this camp.

36
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,289
Colonel Von Luger, it is the sworn duty
of all officers to try to escape.

37
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,685
lf they can't, it is their duty
to cause the enemy

38
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,563
to use an inordinate number
of troops to guard them

39
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,444
and their sworn duty to harass
the enemy to the best of their ability.

40
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,447
Yes, l know.

41
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:16,245
The men under your authority
have been most successful.

42
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,123
This man, Ashley-Pitt, for example.

43
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,038
Caught in the North Sea, escaped,
recaptured, escaped, recaptured.

44
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,799
Archibald ''Archie'' lves:
1 1 escape attempts.

45
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,002
Even tried to jump
out of the truck coming here.

46
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,166
Dickes, William.

47
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,327
Known to have participated
in digging of 1 1 escape tunnels.

48
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,680
Flight Lieutenant Willinski: four escapes.

49
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:40,324
MacDonald: nine.
Hendley, the American: five.

50
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,363
Haynes: four. Sedgwick: seven.
The list is almost endless.

51
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,165
One man here has made
1 7 attempted escapes.

52
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,565
Group Captain, this is close to insanity.

53
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,488
- Quite.
- And it must stop!

54
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,602
Colonel, do you expect officers
to forget their duty?

55
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,007
No.

56
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,329
lt is because we expect the opposite
that we have brought you here.

57
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,607
This is a new camp.

58
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,327
lt has been built
to hold you and your men.

59
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:17,966
lt is organised to incorporate all
we have learned of security measures.

60
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,083
And in me, you will not be
dealing with a common jailer,

61
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:25,202
but with a staff officer
personally selected for the task

62
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,207
by the Luftwaffe high command.

63
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:33,128
We have in effect put
all our rotten eggs in one basket,

64
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,322
and we intend to watch
this basket carefully.

65
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,449
Very wise.

66
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,281
You will not be denied the usual facilities.

67
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,688
Sports, a library, a recreation hall,

68
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,568
and for gardening we will give you tools.

69
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,363
We trust you to use them for gardening.

70
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,288
Devote your energies to these things.

71
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,924
Give up your hopeless
attempts to escape.

72
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,085
And, with intelligent cooperation,

73
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,319
we may all sit out the war

74
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,279
as comfortably as possible.

75
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:32,041
- What do you do here by the truck?
- l'm stealing tools.

76
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,367
- For stealing tools, cooler.
- l was only kidding.

77
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,765
- Oh, you're American.
- Yes, and you're a German.

78
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,529
Of course.
Why do you come to Germany?

79
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,446
- Why fight for England, your enemy?
- Enemy? What are you talkin' about?

80
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,119
- ln 181 2 they burned your capital.
- That's propaganda.

81
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,003
lt's in the history books. l read it.

82
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,363
Now go away from here.
lf you steal tools, cooler.

83
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,367
Yeah. No tools.

84
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,124
Hey, Virgil.

85
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,889
Hey, did you see the cooler?

86
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,762
Boy, is it ever a big one!

87
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,165
- l think they expect a lot of business.
- Yeah.

88
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:14,522
Those two guys who were with us in
the old camp, in hut 1 4, l can't find them.

89
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,722
- You think the goons left 'em behind?
- l guess.

90
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:21,286
What were their names?
lt was Jackson and...

91
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,480
- And Dexter.
- Dexter. That's right.

92
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,602
l'm gonna see who else l can find.
l'll see you later.

93
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,406
Hey, Danny. Who are they?

94
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:55,283
Russian prisoners. They cut down trees.

95
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,243
- They keep them here?
- No, they take them out.

96
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,607
Willie, cigarettes.

97
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,645
Danny and l have a blitz in mind. Could
you put on a brief show for the goons?

98
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,443
Sure, man. What'll it be? An all-out go?

99
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,959
- Choir practice?
- Knuckles, eh?

100
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:34,002
- Yeah. Knuckles will be fine.
- Give him the coat.

101
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,521
- What are you doing with my coat, mate?
- What? lt's mine!

102
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,641
Are you pushing me?

103
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,647
That's mine, you son of a...

104
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,008
Stop it! Stop this nonsense!

105
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,520
lt's all right, mate. We're just
having a friendly little argument.

106
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,289
- No more fighting. No more!
- All right.

107
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,082
- Back in your huts.
- Yes, sir.

108
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,087
You, too!

109
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,560
Get away! Get back in your huts!

110
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,159
Go on!

111
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,524
Hey, Hilts. Looks like there's only
one other American in the whole camp.

112
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,164
Some guy named Hendley
in the RAF Eagle squadron.

113
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,850
Hey, you got something goin' already?

114
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:14,167
See the way the goons
got those towers placed?

115
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,168
- There's a blind spot through the middle.
- A blind spot?

116
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,043
A guy could stand at that wire
and not be seen by either tower.

117
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,128
They'd never see me, especially at night.

118
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,925
- You're crazy.
- You think so? Let's find out right now.

119
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,970
Now, the next step's a little tricky.

120
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,969
- You're not goin' out there?
- Not while they're lookin', l'm not.

121
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,440
l think l'll take a little walk.

122
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,358
- Danny, you speak Russian?
- Only one sentence.

123
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,367
Let me have it, mate.

124
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,727
- What's it mean?
- l love you.

125
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,000
l love you? What bloody good is that?

126
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,803
l don't know.
l wasn't going to use it myself.

127
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,401
Out. Out!

128
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,446
- Your friend, yes?
- Huh?

129
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:28,846
And who vouches for you,
Lieutenant Willinski?

130
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,847
Get out, Sedgwick.

131
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,207
Hold it, hold it!

132
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,887
- Your name?
- lves.

133
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,566
lves.

134
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:20,569
lves. Oh, yes. Archibald lves. Scots.

135
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,999
The photograph doesn't do you justice.

136
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:26,406
l'd like to see one of you
under similar circumstances.

137
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,890
l will not take action against you now.

138
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:57,845
This is the first day here and there has
been much stupidity and carelessness...

139
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,849
on both sides.

140
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,599
Hey! Get out!

141
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,247
Don't shoot!

142
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,205
You fool! To cross the wire is death!

143
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,003
- What wire?
- This wire! The warning wire!

144
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,769
lt's absolutely forbidden to cross it.
You know that.

145
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:39,200
But my baseball rolled over there.
How am l gonna get my baseball?

146
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,163
- You first ask permission.
- Oh, OK.

147
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,885
- Gettin' my baseball.
- Stop this! Get over the wire immediately!

148
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,807
- OK.
- You stay there!

149
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,125
Out of the way. Out.

150
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,525
What are you doing
over here by the wire?

151
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,925
Like l told Max, l was trying to get my...

152
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:15,727
- What were you doing by the wire?
- Well, like l told Max...

153
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:20,084
l was trying to cut my way through
your wire, because l wanna get out.

154
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,487
Do you speak German?

155
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,199
Wire cutters.

156
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:38,047
l have had the pleasure of knowing quite
a number of British officers in this war.

157
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:41,242
And l flatter myself
that we understand one another.

158
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:50,167
You are the first American officer
l have met. Hilts, isn't it?

159
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,087
Captain Hilts, actually.

160
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,007
- 1 7 escape attempts.
- 18, sir.

161
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:57,042
- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.

162
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:01,288
l suppose what's called
in the American army a ''hotshot pilot''.

163
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,765
Unfortunately,
you were shot down anyway.

164
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,529
So we are both grounded
for the duration of the war.

165
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,039
Well, you speak for yourself, Colonel.

166
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:16,479
- You have other plans?
- l haven't seen Berlin yet.

167
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,443
l plan on doing so before the war's over.

168
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:22,960
Are all American officers so ill-mannered?

169
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,729
About 99 per cent.

170
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,887
Perhaps while you are with us,
you will have a chance to learn some.

171
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,604
10 days isolation, Hilts.

172
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,324
- Captain Hilts.
- 20 days.

173
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,724
Right.

174
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,242
Oh, you'll still be here when l get out?

175
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,406
Cooler.

176
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,560
- Name?
- lves.

177
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,442
Flying Officer lves.

178
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,447
Cooler. 20 days.

179
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,727
- Cooler, lves.
- Pleasure.

180
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,805
- Hilts.
- Yeah?

181
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:42,002
What did you do in the States?
Play baseball?

182
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,007
No, l was in college.

183
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,886
- Say, lves.
- Aye?

184
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:51,049
- How many escapes have you tried?
- Four over, seven under.

185
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:56,166
- Tunnel man, huh?
- Sure, l am that.

186
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:00,245
How tall are you, lves?

187
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,042
Five feet four. Why?

188
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,727
Oh, just wondering.

189
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,639
What did you do in college?
Study physical education?

190
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:13,001
Chemical engineering.
Did a little bike riding, though.

191
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,119
Bicycles?

192
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:19,920
Motorcycles. Flat tracks, county fairs.
Picked up a buck here and there.

193
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:23,486
- Helped pay my tuition.
- l did a wee bit of racing myself.

194
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,441
- ln Scotland.
- Bikes?

195
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,883
No, horse racing. Jockey.

196
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,727
Jockey.

197
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:36,680
Jockey.

198
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,279
Hilts?

199
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,487
Are you there, Hilts?

200
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:48,719
Yeah, l'm here.

201
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:51,523
Don't you have them in the States?
Jockeys?

202
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,129
Sure.

203
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:59,608
They were the days. Saturday nights
in towns like Musselburgh and Hamilton.

204
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,484
You had to fight off the birds.

205
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,521
You know, birds.

206
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,481
Girls, man. Girls.

207
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,447
Do you not have them in the States?

208
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,601
Hilts?

209
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,607
Are you there, Hilts?

210
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:17,998
lves.

211
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,527
What?

212
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:27,087
You know the kind of clay and gravel
we got here in the compound?

213
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:30,088
How many feet do you think
you could get through in eight hours?

214
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:34,522
l could go through this dirt here
like the bit on an end of an auger.

215
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:38,247
But you know it's not the digging.
lt's the shoring up with wood

216
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:41,726
and getting the dirt out -
that's what you've to worry about.

217
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,603
No, it isn't, lves.
You don't have to worry about that.

218
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,925
How are you going to get the dirt out?

219
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:50,841
- What do they call a mole in Scotland?
- A mole.

220
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,842
Aye.

221
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,878
Well, what do you think?

222
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,438
l must say,
it's an interesting first 20 minutes.

223
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,367
l'd say we made fools of ourselves.

224
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:07,005
As the sergeant out there says,
this is only the first day.

225
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,327
Eric.

226
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:29,485
Don't take too much notice.
The goons may not know who he is.

227
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,363
- l'll pass the word.
- l'll tell the old man.

228
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,527
He has arrived.

229
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:47,967
The prisoner Bartlett is discharged
into your custody, Colonel Von Luger.

230
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:59,241
l suggest this prisoner be kept

231
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,760
under the strictest
security confinement permanently.

232
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:06,448
Make a note of Herr Kuhn's suggestion.

233
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,845
We have reason to believe
he is the leader

234
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:11,803
of numerous criminal escape attempts.

235
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:16,764
Squadron Leader Bartlett
has been three months in your care,

236
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:20,200
and the Gestapo has only
''reason to believe''?

237
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:24,164
lf he once more falls into our hands,
he will not be so lucky.

238
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:28,602
Air-force officer prisoners are
the responsibility of the Luftwaffe,

239
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,527
not the SS,

240
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,001
or the Gestapo.

241
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,761
At present, yes, Herr Oberst.

242
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:40,326
That is why he is returned
for the moment to your care.

243
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:43,123
Of course, if the Luftwaffe
is not up to the task,

244
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:46,208
the prisoners will find themselves
totally in our charge.

245
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:50,118
We regretfully are not
so professionally understanding.

246
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:56,565
Squadron Leader Bartlett,

247
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:01,402
if you escape again and be caught,
you will be shot.

248
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,287
Herr Kuhn.

249
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,482
- Eric.
- Hello, Roger.

250
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,965
- They dumped you here, too.
- What's this one like?

251
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,967
Well, it's new.

252
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:07,683
Here. Let's find you a bed.

253
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,687
Thanks.

254
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,087
Come in.

255
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,487
- Hello, Roger.
- Hello, sir.

256
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:35,039
- l'll put your bag in your room.
- Thanks, Eric.

257
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:37,889
- How are you?
- As well as can be expected.

258
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:41,366
The fellows wanted to put up
a welcome committee, but that's for later.

259
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:45,688
- l saw Willie and Willinski with Mac.
- A lot of old friends here.

260
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,563
- How long have you been here, sir?
- Arrived today.

261
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:51,079
New camp, expert guards, the elite.

262
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,127
You met the commandant?

263
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,046
Yes, l did.

264
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:00,082
What were the Gestapo
and the SS doing with you?

265
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,804
They wanted to find out
who helped me to the border.

266
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,727
Who else is here? Cavendish?

267
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,569
- Nimmo and Sorren?
- Griffith, Haynes.

268
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,567
- Blythe?
- Yes.

269
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,605
Almost the whole X organisation.

270
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:17,520
Almost. They cleaned out all the other
camps and dumped us in this one.

271
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:21,006
As Von Luger put it:
''All the rotten eggs in one basket.''

272
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,240
There's madness in their method.

273
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,679
What about Tommy Bristol?

274
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:29,005
No, but there's an American - Hendley.

275
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,446
ls he a scrounger, blackmailer?

276
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:36,047
- MacDonald says he's the best.
- Good.

277
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,327
Last of the tea until
the Red Cross gets through again.

278
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,600
l scrounged this from Sedgwick.

279
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:50,483
Did the Gestapo give you a rough time?

280
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,329
Not nearly as rough
as l now intend to give them.

281
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:58,726
Roger, personal revenge must be
kept out of what we have to do here.

282
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,045
Too many lives are at stake.

283
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:07,039
What my personal feelings are
is of no importance.

284
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:11,047
You appointed me Big X,
and it's my duty to harass,

285
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:13,843
confound and confuse the enemy
to the best of my ability.

286
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,928
- That's true.
- That's what l intend to do.

287
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:22,278
l'm gonna cause such a terrible stink
in this Third Reich of theirs

288
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:26,403
that thousands of troops'll be
tied up here looking after us.

289
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,849
How?

290
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:30,803
By putting more men out of this

291
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,683
perfect camp of theirs
than have ever escaped before.

292
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:38,520
Not two or three or a dozen, but 200, 300.
Scatter them all over Germany.

293
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,959
- Think that's possible?
- The men are here to do it.

294
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:45,561
The goons have put every escape artist
in Germany here. You said so yourself.

295
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,204
Have you thought of what it might cost?

296
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:54,682
l've thought of the humiliation
if we just tamely submit,

297
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:57,040
knuckle under and crawl.

298
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:00,128
Surely you don't advocate that,
do you, sir?

299
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,923
l have to point out
one thing to you, Roger.

300
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:05,928
No matter how unsatisfactory
this camp may be,

301
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:08,962
the high command have left us
in the hands of the Luftwaffe,

302
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,001
not the Gestapo and the SS.

303
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:16,685
Look, sir, you talk about
the high command of the Luftwaffe,

304
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,368
then the SS and the Gestapo.

305
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:22,244
To me they're the same.
We're fighting the bloody lot.

306
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,247
There's only one way to put it, sir.

307
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:27,840
They are the common enemies of
everyone who believes in freedom.

308
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,848
lf they didn't approve of Hitler,
why didn't they throw him out?

309
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:33,530
l have no argument with you, Roger.

310
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:37,438
As senior officer, l'm merely
pointing out a pertinent fact.

311
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:43,125
When are you calling a meeting, X?

312
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,807
Tonight.

313
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:09,527
Gentlemen, no doubt you've heard the
immortal words of our new commandant.

314
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:12,039
''Devote your energies
to things other than escape

315
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:14,365
and sit out the war
as comfortably as possible.''

316
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:19,608
Well, that's exactly
what we're going to do.

317
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,802
We're going to devote our energies
to sports and gardening,

318
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:25,649
all the cultural pursuits
as far as they're concerned.

319
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:28,603
ln fact, we're going to
put the goons to sleep.

320
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:32,083
Meanwhile, we dig.

321
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:36,483
Now, even a superficial look
at the compound

322
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:39,682
shows us that huts 104 and 5
are closest to the woods.

323
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:42,040
The first tunnel goes out from 105,

324
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:45,082
directly east
under the cooler and the wire.

325
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,280
But that's over 300 feet, Roger.

326
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:50,243
- Did you make a survey, Dennis?
- Only a temporary one, sir.

327
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:53,806
- l make it just over 335 feet.
- Tell me when you've got an exact one.

328
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:57,718
Willie, this time we'll dig straight down
30 feet before we go horizontal.

329
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:01,001
That'll rule out any question
of sound detection or probing.

330
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:04,361
All right, Roger,
but did you say the <i>first</i> tunnel?

331
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:07,323
l did. There'll be three.

332
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:12,569
We'll call them Tom, Dick and Harry.
Tom goes out directly east from 104.

333
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:17,525
Dick goes north from the kitchen, and
Harry goes out parallel to Tom from 105.

334
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:22,121
lf the goons find one,
we'll move into the other.

335
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,927
How many men do you
plan to take out, Roger?

336
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,119
250.

337
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:33,008
There'll be no half measures this time.
ldentification papers for everyone.

338
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:36,202
And, Griff, we'll need outfits for the lot.

339
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,719
- 250?
- Mostly civilian clothes.

340
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,681
Yes, but...

341
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,848
OK, Roger.

342
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:48,486
Mac. Maps, blankets, rations,
compasses for all the walkers.

343
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,840
- Timetables for every train.
- Right, Roger.

344
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:59,362
- Sorry l'm late, Roger.
- lt's all right, Colin. Sit down.

345
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:01,367
We're going to tunnel.

346
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,647
Splendid.

347
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:10,289
Willie, you and Danny'll be tunnel kings.
Danny, you'll be in charge of traps.

348
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:13,447
Sedgwick, manufacturer.
Griff, as l said, tailor.

349
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:18,246
Nimmo and Haynes, diversions. Mac,
of course, will take care of intelligence.

350
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,645
Hendley. We haven't met.

351
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,647
- Scrounger?
- Right.

352
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,965
Dennis, maps and surveys.

353
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:30,402
Colin, you'll take your usual job. Eric,
how are you gonna get rid of this dirt?

354
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:35,365
Usual places. l hadn't anticipated
three tunnels, but we'll manage.

355
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,641
Roger, who's going to handle
security for all this?

356
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:42,683
You are. l want a system of stooges
covering this compound

357
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:46,598
from front to back,
checking every goon in and out.

358
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:50,848
l want a signal system so perfect
that if ever a ferret gets within 50 feet

359
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:55,248
of any of the huts in which we're working,
we can shut down without a sign.

360
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:59,881
Well, l don't think there's much point
in discussing any more now.

361
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:04,765
l'll meet each of you on the exercise
circuit, and we'll pound out the details.

362
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,041
Nothing else, is there, Mac?

363
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,365
l shouldn't think so, Roger.

364
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,120
Oh, hello.

365
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,729
My name's Blythe.

366
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,000
Hendley.

367
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:49,207
- For birds.
- l used to do a little hunting myself.

368
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:51,969
Oh, not hunting. Watching.

369
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:55,523
Oh, a bird watcher?

370
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:59,199
Yes, that's right.
Watching them and drawing them.

371
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,285
l suppose you have
bird watchers in the States?

372
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,480
Yes, we have some.

373
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,049
Tea?

374
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:12,478
l only drank tea once, in the hospital.

375
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,122
Where's your kit?

376
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:20,289
This is it. The rest was confiscated
in the last shakedown.

377
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:25,366
The goons didn't appreciate
some of my more personal items.

378
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:30,123
Such as.

379
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:33,767
- You're the scrounger.
- Yes, that's right.

380
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:36,287
l'll need a camera.

381
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,930
- What kind?
- A good one.

382
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:45,078
A 35mm f2.8 with a focal-plane shutter
should do all right.

383
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,923
All right.

384
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,280
- And film, of course.
- Oh, of course.

385
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:56,526
Oh, Hendley. l need a pick. Big heavy one.

386
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,925
- Only one?
- Two would be better.

387
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:05,645
l'm afraid this tea's pathetic.

388
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:09,604
l must have used these
wretched leaves about 20 times.

389
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:12,119
lt's not that l mind so much.

390
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,810
Tea without milk is so uncivilised.

391
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,446
Yeah.

392
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,242
l'll get our wood.

393
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,647
Close up! Close up!

394
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:38,207
Close up!

395
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,208
Close up!

396
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,524
Close up!

397
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:45,608
- No me <i>sprlchln</i> the English.
- Close up!

398
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,327
Splendid.

399
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:26,009
Blythe, what are you doing here?

400
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:30,485
l'm in Photographic Aerial
Reconnaissance lnterpretation.

401
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:34,285
Went for a joyride to see for myself.
lt's my own silly fault.

402
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:39,120
The aircraft bought it.
Got shot down. Terrifying.

403
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:43,922
- No, l mean, what do you do here?
- Here?

404
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:48,007
l'm the forger.

405
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:09,763
Forgers are installing themselves
in the recreation hut.

406
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,164
- Sedgwick?
- l'm in 1 10.

407
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:14,805
- Griffith.
- Well, l'd like to work in 109, Roger.

408
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:16,921
109? Right.

409
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:21,407
l'll work in 107. For now, Danny, Willie
and their trap team will be in 104.

410
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:25,603
l want to take a chance on the tunnels
and press ahead without any shoring-up.

411
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,847
We will need timber for the shafts
and the entrance chambers.

412
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:31,484
Hendley figures
there are 36 empty bunks.

413
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:35,080
We can tear up 1 5 and move the men
around so the goons won't miss them.

414
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:37,246
The rest will come
from strips off the wall.

415
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:40,203
- ls Hendley taking care of this himself?
- Not yet.

416
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:43,163
He's working on some steel
for a pick that Danny needs.

417
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,719
Hey! What the hell is going on here?

418
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:06,001
Turn the water off! Get your hands away!

419
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:08,285
Get away!

420
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:12,202
Hey! What the hell's going on there?

421
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,921
Stop this nonsense!

422
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:19,039
Get away!

423
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:20,762
Turn the water off!

424
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:21,766
Somewhere!

425
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:05,119
ln the stove, we keep fire burning always.
The goons will not feel like moving it.

426
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:09,368
- Good.
- Hendley, two tiles, they are chipped.

427
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:12,527
- We need new ones.
- There's some in 1 1 3's washroom.

428
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:14,402
- Should match perfectly.
- Good.

429
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:25,809
lt's going to be a bit tricky, Danny.

430
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:29,046
Not when you're organised, Mac.

431
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,646
- We're ready.
- Big enough?

432
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:39,558
lt's perfect. Right through
the middle of the foundation.

433
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,728
Good luck to us, Danny.

434
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:07,160
Why 1 7?

435
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:10,123
This is the 1 7th tunnel Danny's started.

436
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:42,487
All right?

437
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:58,847
lt's good.

438
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:09,167
lt's very good.

439
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:47,846
Get out! Get out!

440
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:13,799
You're not in your hut?
What are you doing here?

441
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:14,840
Mopping up.

442
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:21,923
- And you?
- Shower. l need a wash.

443
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:28,563
l'm watching him. l'm a lifeguard.

444
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:36,240
Put on warm clothes.
You might be outside all night.

445
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:26,849
No. l vote no. Look, we've put
the goons to sleep exactly like you said.

446
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:31,202
But just one little thing like this
and we're up the creek without a paddle.

447
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:34,561
- lves, sit down, won't you?
- Hello, sir.

448
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:37,363
Hello. Squadron Leader Bartlett,
Captain Hilts.

449
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:39,958
Flight Lieutenant MacDonald.

450
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:43,526
l understand you two
are contemplating a blitz-out.

451
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:45,720
Where'd you hear that... sir?

452
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:49,479
MacDonald. lt's Mac's job
to know everything that goes on.

453
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:52,363
We thought perhaps we might talk it over.

454
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:54,765
Why? lt's only a two-man job.

455
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:58,405
Everybody in the camp is supposed to
clear all escape attempts in advance

456
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:00,805
with Squadron Leader Bartlett here.

457
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,285
We don't necessarily want to interfere.

458
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:08,404
lt's just that... well, what sort of blitz
were you contemplating?

459
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:12,167
We sneak out at night to a spot
l found near the wire - a blind spot.

460
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:15,646
Then we dig down, take the dirt,
spread it on top so it won't make a pile,

461
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:17,408
and then straight out.

462
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:21,284
lves here is a tunnel man, so he digs
in front, pushes the dirt behind him.

463
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:25,039
l stash it behind me, then we burrow
through the dirt like a couple of moles.

464
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:29,925
By dawn we're under the wire, across
the open space, into the woods and gone.

465
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:37,079
Well...

466
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:42,239
When do you intend to try this?

467
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:44,884
- When do you intend to try it?
- Oh, tonight.

468
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:50,207
Hilts, this may not be quite
the right time for this sort of thing.

469
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:53,527
Look, sir, l've been in the bag
nearly three years now,

470
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:55,845
bloody close to being wire-happy.

471
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:58,803
lt's a blitz-out for me, or forget it.

472
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:01,728
lt'll work. l know it will.

473
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:10,849
Good luck.

474
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:12,847
Thank you.

475
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:18,689
- Hilts, um... how do you breathe?
- We got a steel rod with hinges on it.

476
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:21,324
We shove it up and make air holes
as we go along.

477
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:23,281
Good night, sir.

478
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:31,728
Now, why didn't anybody
think of that before?

479
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:35,081
lt's so stupid, it's positively brilliant.

480
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:38,088
But it'll bring every goon
in the camp down on top of us.

481
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:40,485
l don't know.
Perhaps we're being too clever.

482
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:42,566
lf we stop all the breakouts,

483
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:46,080
it may only convince the goons
that we must be tunnelling.

484
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:51,648
l hope it works. lf it doesn't, they're going
to be in the cooler for an awful long time.

485
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:38,283
- Good, huh?
- Danny, it's bloody beautiful.

486
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:48,165
- This is the dirt from the compound.
- This is from the tunnel.

487
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:57,241
Wherever we put it,
they're going to spot it a mile away.

488
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:00,283
Maybe we could put it under the huts.
The dirt's dark there.

489
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:03,846
lt's the first place the ferrets would look.
l saw one measuring yesterday.

490
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:06,200
Maybe we could dry it to the same colour.

491
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:10,164
- There are 50 tons of it.
- l was just thinking out loud.

492
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:13,441
lf you must think,
for God's sake, think clearly.

493
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:16,406
Where the devil is Ashley-Pitt?

494
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:21,126
We can't destroy the dirt
and we can't eat it.

495
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,322
The only thing left to do is camouflage it.

496
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:27,044
That's as far as my thinking takes me.

497
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:30,525
Didn't they teach you
promptness in the RN?

498
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:33,528
You'll never believe it,
but l think l have the solution.

499
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:37,643
The problem is somehow to get rid of
this tunnel dirt over the compound.

500
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:39,647
Well, of course.

501
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:42,127
Would you mind?

502
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:53,487
Now...

503
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:58,520
you fill these bags
with the dirt from the tunnel.

504
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:01,847
Then, wearing them inside your trousers,

505
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:04,086
you wander out into the compound

506
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:08,123
where you pull these
strings in your pockets.

507
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:11,240
Out come the pins.

508
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:18,719
- Eric, it's good.
- All you have to do is kick it in.

509
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:21,405
Unless you're a fool,
the ferrets won't see a thing.

510
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:24,442
lt's indecently brilliant.
What do you think, Roger?

511
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:28,529
- We'll try it first thing tomorrow.
- l already have. lt works.

512
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:32,764
Mac, this is what we'll do.

513
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:49,967
- A little present from Tom, sir.
- Thank you, Nimmo.

514
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:00,127
Nice garden you've got, sir.

515
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:33,801
All right. Let's look sharp.

516
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:41,765
That looks sharp.

517
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:47,648
Sir.

518
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:54,929
Please, gentlemen, continue.
This is merely a routine inspection.

519
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:11,964
- Good morning, Squadron Leader.
- Good morning, sir.

520
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:16,003
l am sorry the soil here isn't
better suited to your men's purpose.

521
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:18,007
We'll manage, sir.

522
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:31,089
l must say l am surprised with
the extent of this activity, Group Captain.

523
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:34,919
- Pleased, of course, but surprised.
- Surprised, Colonel?

524
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:40,568
Fliers are gentlemen, not peasants
to dig in the earth. So l am surprised.

525
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,726
The English are keen on gardening.

526
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:46,684
Oh, yes, but flowers. ls this not so?

527
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:49,725
You can't eat flowers, Colonel.

528
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:53,727
Good point.

529
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:13,082
l have the nasty feeling
he knows exactly what we're doing.

530
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:16,327
- Maybe he does.
- You don't really think so, do you?

531
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:18,805
lf he does, we'll find out soon enough.

532
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:32,001
- Morning, Bob.
- Andy.

533
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:35,327
Here we are. Now, let's see.

534
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:37,805
Biscuits, two packets.

535
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:40,125
Coffee, two tins.

536
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,400
Bovril, one jar.

537
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:44,998
Cigarettes, six packets.

538
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:49,329
Strawberry jam, Sorren's.
Black currant jam, Cavendish.

539
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:51,406
And marmalade, mine.

540
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:55,762
Danish butter, Von Luger's.
l liberated it from his mess supplies.

541
00:53:55,890 --> 00:54:00,327
Oh, yes. And Dutch chocolate. Two bars.

542
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:04,562
That cleans out the gift food
for the entire organisation.

543
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:07,762
Now, the first thing we need
is the new form of travel permit.

544
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:10,609
The forgers have no idea
what it looks like.

545
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:12,004
l'll see what l can do.

546
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:15,600
And, of course, any other
identity cards, personal papers,

547
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:17,846
documents you can put your hands on.

548
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:20,006
- Anyway, put 'em to work, Bob.
- Right.

549
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:22,007
Good luck.

550
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:33,609
O come all ye faithful

551
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:36,802
Joyful and triumphant

552
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:38,801
O come ye

553
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:44,368
O come ye to Bethlehem

554
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:47,766
Come and behold Him

555
00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:50,848
Born the King of Angels

556
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:54,406
O come let us adore Him

557
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:57,840
O come let us adore Him

558
00:54:57,970 --> 00:55:02,407
O come let us adore Him

559
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:04,964
Louis, where the hell is the air pump?

560
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:06,887
Patience is a virtue, Roger.

561
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:10,685
Yes, l know, but the diggers
can only work when the trap's open,

562
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:13,165
and this is holding us up very badly.

563
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:16,961
- ls it finished?
- Of course.

564
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:19,809
- Why isn't it in?
- Working on the air ducts now.

565
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:23,161
- Well, when will they be finished?
- One or two days.

566
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:25,645
- Does it work?
- Of course it works.

567
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:29,722
- Will it give us enough air?
- As much as you'll need.

568
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:31,809
Mac.

569
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:33,807
Excellent.

570
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:37,039
Have it in by tomorrow night.

571
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:41,288
Christ the Lord

572
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:49,645
- Got a light?
- Yeah.

573
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:54,248
Thanks.

574
00:55:54,370 --> 00:55:56,565
- lt's pretty, isn't it?
- Yes.

575
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:06,799
Oh, l'm sorry. Would you like one?

576
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:12,242
l'll smoke it later when l'm off duty.
Thank you.

577
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:15,203
You probably have
a couple of roommates, huh?

578
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:20,886
- Beautiful day.
- Yes, but l think it might rain later.

579
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:22,443
No, no.

580
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:25,482
Red sky in the morning,
sailor takes warning.

581
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:27,601
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

582
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:29,686
lt was a red sky last night.

583
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:31,607
l never heard that before.

584
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:33,960
l learned it in the Boy Scouts.

585
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,524
- You were a Boy Scout? So was l.
- Really?

586
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:39,448
- Yes. l had 1 9 merit badges.
- l had 20.

587
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:43,919
l was working on my 20th when
the government abolished scouting

588
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:47,645
and sent me into the Hitler Youth instead.

589
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:54,529
Werner, you think you'll stay
in the army after the war?

590
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:57,323
No. l'm not a well man.

591
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:59,202
- And my teeth...
- Your teeth?

592
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:01,924
Yes. l could tell you
stories about my teeth

593
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:04,200
that would make your hair stand on end.

594
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:06,639
Our dentist here is a butcher.

595
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:10,405
But don't tell anyone l said so.

596
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:13,519
lt's a soldier's right to complain.

597
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:16,005
Maybe in your army, but here?

598
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:20,842
One little criticism,
and... to the Russian front.

599
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:24,280
ls that so? Terrible.

600
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:27,047
That's terrible.

601
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:34,127
Werner.

602
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:38,846
Why don't we go into my room?

603
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:41,803
l'd better not.
lf Strachwitz should see me...

604
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:46,964
l was just gonna make some coffee.

605
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:51,287
Real coffee.

606
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:21,049
Coffee, coffee, coffee.

607
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:23,047
Where is it?

608
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:32,041
My grandmother keeps
sending me this stuff.

609
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:39,645
Oh, yeah. Here. Take one.

610
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:49,526
Yeah. Keep it.

611
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:51,527
<i>Nlin.</i> l must go.

612
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:54,804
lt's OK. You can keep it. We're friends.

613
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:57,888
With you in the cooler,
will we be friends? l must report this.

614
00:58:58,010 --> 00:59:03,130
l don't understand you. Report what?
That you and l were chatting in my room?

615
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:05,923
- l must go.
- Oh, here. lt's OK. Look, keep it.

616
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:09,486
l'll never be able to eat it all.
l've got all l could eat.

617
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:12,124
l'm sorry. All right. Forget it. Forget it.

618
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:47,642
And that, l'm sure you'll all remember,
is the voice of the Nelles warbler.

619
00:59:47,770 --> 00:59:51,001
Let's turn our attention to this gentleman -
the masked shrike.

620
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:53,564
<i>Kanius nubicus.</i> The butcherbird.

621
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:57,046
The shrike impales his foes
on the spikes of thorn bushes.

622
00:59:57,170 --> 01:00:00,799
Not a very lovable character, you see.
Let's have a look at the colouring.

623
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:04,240
Uniform black above, from head to tail.

624
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:09,490
A black rump, a black crown with a bold
white flash, and a white line over the eye.

625
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:12,329
The shrike lives
in lightly wooded country...

626
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:16,329
Ah. Hendley. Sit down. You'll find
drawing materials on the table.

627
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:20,844
The shrike lives in lightly wooded
country, olive groves and gardens.

628
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:23,325
Well, Hendley, have you
taken to birds too now?

629
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:25,964
Yeah. Stick around.
You might learn something.

630
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:28,604
l have better things to do than draw birds.

631
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:34,564
The voice is a monotonous succession
of scratchy, complaining notes.

632
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:38,046
Now, let's have a good look at this bird.
He's got a round shape...

633
01:00:57,450 --> 01:01:01,523
An <i>Urlaubsschlin.</i> Permission to
cross a frontier. Here's another one.

634
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:03,880
Which one's the forgery?

635
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:07,365
- That one.
- That's right.

636
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:09,162
They both are.

637
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:12,642
What's holding us up now is
the new form of this travel permit.

638
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:15,568
- We've no idea what they look like.
- Here's one.

639
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:19,485
And a military identity card.

640
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:21,769
And a...

641
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:23,403
- An <i>Auswlis.</i>
- Yeah.

642
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:27,284
- Permission to be on Reich property.
- A ticket to Oden.

643
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:31,289
What appears to be the ferret
assignments for the next week.

644
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:34,125
You get 10 out of 10 for this, old boy.

645
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:38,038
- Thank you, sir. Take good care of that.
- Where did you get this?

646
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:40,927
lt's on loan.

647
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:45,043
ln order to get
the right amount of outfits, Roger,

648
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:48,480
l suggest that we work
mainly from service uniforms.

649
01:01:48,610 --> 01:01:52,285
l can do double-breasteds,
single-breasteds,

650
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:55,208
and rather nice lounge suits.

651
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:57,844
Lapels. l can do quite a lot
of things with those.

652
01:01:57,970 --> 01:02:02,407
l can have them deep like that
or high ones like that.

653
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:06,528
Here's one that
we're working on right now.

654
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:09,164
Oh, yes. What about buttons?

655
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:14,687
Take a look at those.
Here's one that l've finished, Roger.

656
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:22,925
And here's one that l dyed
with a bottle of blue ink.

657
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:27,362
lt's rather good. What's up, Roger?

658
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:30,368
The goons'd have a field day
if they crashed in on this lot.

659
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:34,608
That's Sorren's department. Now, l've
started working on the other materials.

660
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:36,641
This blanket.

661
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:39,728
Particularly the stripes. Marvellous.

662
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:40,965
- Coats.
- Yes.

663
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,843
l've got the chaps working on these
all over the compound.

664
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:46,768
Those battle dresses -
l'm afraid they're a bit too short.

665
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:51,520
l'll have to get the chaps to make those
into some sort of workingman's outfits.

666
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:53,800
Blanket ticking.

667
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:58,446
Now, l've made these into
rather nice little waistcoats.

668
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:01,960
- Very dapper, yes. Dyed, of course.
- Of course.

669
01:03:02,090 --> 01:03:04,445
Just take a look at this, Roger.

670
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:09,564
Now, this blanket material, we scrape
this down until it's really smooth,

671
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:11,840
and then dye it with boot polish.

672
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:15,758
Corduroy scrounged by Hendley.
l wish we had more of this.

673
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:18,643
- Where in God's name did you get these?
- Hendley.

674
01:03:18,770 --> 01:03:20,965
- Where did he get them?
- l asked him that.

675
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:23,650
- What did he say?
- ''Don't ask.''

676
01:03:23,770 --> 01:03:26,682
Let me show you some of the overcoats
l've been working on.

677
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:57,287
Good morning, Hilts.

678
01:03:58,930 --> 01:04:01,967
Well, if you're here to find out
if l'm going out again, l am.

679
01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:04,046
- When?
- 1 7 days. 7th of July.

680
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:05,922
- Dark of the moon.
- Correct.

681
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:08,405
ls lves going with you?

682
01:04:08,530 --> 01:04:11,169
Yeah, if he wants to.

683
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:14,566
You know that lves is close to cracking?

684
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:17,481
Yeah.

685
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:22,006
- Better for him to go out in the tunnel?
- Safer.

686
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,645
Right.

687
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:34,325
lt's possible for one man to get out
through the wire, even get away,

688
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:39,808
but there are in fact a considerable
number of people besides yourself

689
01:04:39,930 --> 01:04:42,080
in this camp who are trying to escape.

690
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:45,007
l appreciate that.

691
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:49,367
Something's coming - l can feel it -

692
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:52,926
and it's coming right around the corner
at me, Squadron Leader.

693
01:04:53,050 --> 01:04:55,200
- My name's Roger.
- All right, Roger.

694
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:57,605
Yours is Virgil, isn't it?

695
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:01,284
Hilts. Just make it Hilts.

696
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:06,403
Yes, well, as l was saying, Hilts,

697
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:10,403
we have maps of Germany -
general maps, that is.

698
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:14,523
We have all the information we need
for the escape routes out of Germany.

699
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:16,720
But what we do not have...

700
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:20,160
ls a clear idea of what's 500 yards
beyond those trees.

701
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:23,009
We've tried every goon in the camp.
No go.

702
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:26,725
We must know the exact position
of the local town.

703
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:29,644
We want to know where
we hit the main roads.

704
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:33,240
Where the police stations are,
where they've got their roadblocks.

705
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:37,648
And most important of all,
we've got to know how to get from here

706
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:40,125
to the railway station.

707
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:43,560
No. Absolutely not.
When l get through that wire,

708
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:46,204
l'm not gonna be
making maps for you guys.

709
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:51,723
l'm gonna be so far away, you won't hear
if they're shooting at me with howitzers.

710
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:54,523
- Understandable.
- Completely.

711
01:05:56,850 --> 01:05:59,159
l mean, l'd like to help, but...

712
01:06:02,570 --> 01:06:04,879
lnteresting idea.

713
01:06:05,010 --> 01:06:08,082
- How many you taking out?
- 250.

714
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:12,681
250?

715
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:14,641
Yeah.

716
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:17,121
You're crazy. You too.

717
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:20,606
250 guys just walking down the road,
just like that.

718
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:24,439
Well, some on the road, some by train,
some cross-country.

719
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:26,800
They'll have forged papers, clothes,

720
01:06:26,930 --> 01:06:28,761
maps, compasses, rations.

721
01:06:28,890 --> 01:06:31,609
You're gonna alert
every goon in the country.

722
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:34,722
Anybody that can carry a pitchfork
is gonna be out looking for you.

723
01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:39,605
They're gonna swoop down and scoop
you up so fast it'd make your head swim.

724
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:44,121
Yes, well, thanks, anyway.

725
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:47,367
- lf l can help on the tunnel, let me know.
- That's good of you.

726
01:06:47,490 --> 01:06:49,367
Any time.

727
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:55,804
Wait a minute. You aren't seriously
suggesting that if l get through the wire

728
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:58,842
and case everything out there
and don't get picked up,

729
01:06:58,970 --> 01:07:01,643
to turn myself in
and get thrown back in the cooler

730
01:07:01,770 --> 01:07:04,079
so you can get the information you need?

731
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:08,681
Yes. One has to ask some very
strange things in the job l have.

732
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:11,847
- We'll give you a front place.
- l wouldn't do that for my own mother.

733
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:13,722
- l don't blame you.
- Well, OK, then.

734
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:16,603
- lt's completely understandable.
- Well, OK, then.

735
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:20,927
Yes, well, thanks, Hilts.

736
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:29,927
Check.

737
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:34,488
Herr Hendley, l...

738
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:36,965
Oh, it's all right. Blythe's a friend.

739
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:43,479
- What's the matter, Werner?
- My wallet, my papers, my identity card.

740
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:46,682
Gone. l lost them. Everything.

741
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:49,407
He lost his wallet.

742
01:07:49,530 --> 01:07:52,840
Do you realise what would happen
if Strachwitz found this out?

743
01:07:52,970 --> 01:07:54,961
- The Russian front.
- Dear, dear.

744
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:00,558
l've looked every place, every place.

745
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:04,680
l must have lost them while l was in here.

746
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:07,165
- No.
- Yes.

747
01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:10,885
Look, l told you we were friends.
We'll find them.

748
01:08:11,010 --> 01:08:13,319
Oh, thank you, Herr Hendley.

749
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:16,322
Werner.

750
01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:19,408
Not now. lt might look a little peculiar

751
01:08:19,530 --> 01:08:22,966
if you and l were seen
probing around at this time of night.

752
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:28,919
Look, l'll find them. l promise you l'll
find 'em if l have to tear this room apart.

753
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:37,844
- Thank you.
- Forget it.

754
01:08:37,970 --> 01:08:39,323
- Werner.
- Yes?

755
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:41,680
There is one small favour.

756
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:44,280
A camera.

757
01:08:45,570 --> 01:08:48,926
We want to take some snapshots.
You know, keepsakes.

758
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:54,164
35mm with a 2.8 lens and a plane shutter.

759
01:08:54,410 --> 01:08:56,287
Focal-plane shutter.

760
01:08:57,850 --> 01:09:01,240
Werner, that's a focal-plane shutter.

761
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:04,202
Let me know when you got it.

762
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:13,287
He's a crazy, mixed-up kid,
that Werner, but l like him.

763
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:15,287
Checkmate.

764
01:09:38,410 --> 01:09:40,560
How soon's our air pump
going to be ready?

765
01:09:40,690 --> 01:09:43,921
- l'll have it for you tomorrow.
- You're badly behind schedule.

766
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:46,280
- How's it coming, Danny?
- No good.

767
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:48,799
- No good?
- Today, three times.

768
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:07,089
Willie, you all right?

769
01:10:07,210 --> 01:10:09,087
Pull!

770
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:41,480
You're gonna have to shore up the whole
bloody tunnel, Roger. All 335 feet of it.

771
01:10:41,610 --> 01:10:43,487
Four times today.

772
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:48,319
This way we never get through.
We must have more wood.

773
01:10:49,290 --> 01:10:52,487
lt's a lot of timber, Roger. Can you get it?

774
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:58,083
We'll get it. We've gotta get it.

775
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:02,680
l'll put Hendley on it,
and the new man we got this morning.

776
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:04,765
OK, Willie.

777
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:08,520
On the first day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

778
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:11,005
A partridge in a pear tree

779
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:14,442
On the second day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

780
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:17,926
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

781
01:11:18,410 --> 01:11:21,402
On the fourth day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

782
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:23,725
Four calling birds, three French hens

783
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:27,525
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

784
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:30,960
On the fifth day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

785
01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:33,968
Five gold rings

786
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:39,038
- How's it going with the rafters up there?
- Taking out one in four.

787
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:45,679
Stay with it.

788
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:48,847
Five gold rings

789
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:50,847
Four calling birds, three French hens

790
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:54,485
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

791
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:57,920
On the seventh day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

792
01:11:58,050 --> 01:12:00,518
Seven swans a-swimming,
six geese a-laying

793
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:03,642
Five gold rings

794
01:12:03,770 --> 01:12:05,761
Four calling birds, three French hens

795
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:09,929
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

796
01:12:22,730 --> 01:12:25,563
Five gold rings, four calling birds...

797
01:12:25,690 --> 01:12:28,966
Bloody singing. l've never worked
so hard in all my life. Hi, Hilts.

798
01:12:29,090 --> 01:12:30,045
Say, Cavendish...

799
01:12:30,170 --> 01:12:32,126
Three French hens, two turtle doves

800
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:34,081
And a partridge in a pear...

801
01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:36,087
<i>Alllz</i> hup!

802
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:44,247
Never mind.

803
01:12:53,850 --> 01:12:56,444
Here's a present from our friend Werner.

804
01:12:56,570 --> 01:12:58,162
Splendid.

805
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:00,201
Simply splendid.

806
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:03,320
This should do very nicely.

807
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:08,522
Those are Ashley-Pitt's men.

808
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:12,609
He requested permission to dispose
of some of his dirt in our attic.

809
01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:22,003
Tom has reached just beyond
that pile of wood, sir.

810
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:26,248
- Harry, of course, isn't as far as that.
- How much further to the trees?

811
01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:28,281
We make it 50 feet, sir.

812
01:14:28,410 --> 01:14:31,607
- Dark of the moon is the 7th...
- 8th and 9th.

813
01:14:31,730 --> 01:14:33,607
A day earlier in August.

814
01:14:39,490 --> 01:14:41,321
Morning.

815
01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:44,401
There he goes again.

816
01:14:44,530 --> 01:14:46,964
Why is he buying up all
the potatoes in the camp?

817
01:14:47,090 --> 01:14:49,809
l've been working on that,
but l can't find out.

818
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:52,364
Hilts and Hendley
lock themselves in every night.

819
01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:55,641
Sometimes Goff's with them.
Other nights he's on guard outside.

820
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:59,604
Mac, we'll close down Dick and Harry.
Seal them off.

821
01:14:59,730 --> 01:15:02,449
Put the entire effort into Tom
and press on into the trees.

822
01:15:02,570 --> 01:15:04,003
Right, Roger.

823
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:51,449
Wow.

824
01:15:53,370 --> 01:15:54,928
Wow.

825
01:15:56,810 --> 01:15:58,209
Wow.

826
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:25,208
Wow.

827
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:33,043
Wow.

828
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:42,649
Wow.

829
01:17:31,330 --> 01:17:32,319
About face!

830
01:17:33,530 --> 01:17:35,407
Forward march!

831
01:17:42,330 --> 01:17:46,005
- What is it?
- They're celebrating the revolution.

832
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:48,007
lt's the 4th of July.

833
01:17:57,170 --> 01:17:58,888
What the devil's this?

834
01:18:04,610 --> 01:18:06,680
Gentlemen, you're invited for free drinks.

835
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:10,405
- A little present from the colonials.
- Down the British.

836
01:18:10,530 --> 01:18:12,919
- Quite right too.
- And a little drink to Tom.

837
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:15,086
And to getting home.

838
01:18:15,210 --> 01:18:16,723
Very well. We accept.

839
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:18,602
- Up the rebels!
- Down the British!

840
01:18:18,730 --> 01:18:20,083
Gentlemen, follow us.

841
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:22,087
About face!

842
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:42,847
Company, halt!

843
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:49,005
All right, let's line up down here!

844
01:18:50,050 --> 01:18:52,325
All right, grab a cup!

845
01:18:52,450 --> 01:18:54,327
Line it up! Here we go.

846
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:03,684
That explains what happened
to the potatoes.

847
01:19:03,810 --> 01:19:06,688
No harm in closing down Tom
for one day, Roger.

848
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:09,529
l suppose it'll do us all good
to let off a bit of steam.

849
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:13,359
There's only 1 4 feet to go, sir, and you
can feel it throughout the whole camp.

850
01:19:13,490 --> 01:19:16,288
- l think that calls for a drink.
- Hear, hear.

851
01:19:16,410 --> 01:19:18,560
- Drink it up!
- What is this stuff, Hilts?

852
01:19:18,690 --> 01:19:21,807
Moonshine.
American moonshine. Moonshine.

853
01:19:21,930 --> 01:19:24,364
Make my moustache grow. Cheers.

854
01:19:24,490 --> 01:19:26,685
Keep it moving.

855
01:19:26,810 --> 01:19:28,926
Hello, Eric. Don't spill any of that.

856
01:19:29,050 --> 01:19:31,325
- There you go.
- Down with the British.

857
01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:34,602
All right, old cobber. Keep it mo...

858
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:38,287
- Don't get any on your clothes.
- Cheers!

859
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:42,208
- Don't spill any of that.
- Before your morning tea?

860
01:19:42,330 --> 01:19:44,400
Keep it moving.

861
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:46,521
Don't get any on your clothes, sir.

862
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:49,881
American moonshine.
Don't smoke right after you drink it.

863
01:19:50,010 --> 01:19:52,888
No smoking.
No smoking while you're drinking.

864
01:20:07,330 --> 01:20:09,207
Get good and stoned, my friend.

865
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:13,640
Keep it going. Keep it...

866
01:20:14,450 --> 01:20:17,726
No taxation without representation.

867
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:20,239
Keep it going, boys. Keep it...

868
01:20:21,610 --> 01:20:23,840
Keep it going, fellas. Enjoy yourselves.

869
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:26,279
Well, let's drink to Tom.

870
01:20:26,410 --> 01:20:28,287
To Tom.

871
01:20:34,850 --> 01:20:39,002
ln the three years, seven months
and two weeks that l've been in the bag,

872
01:20:39,130 --> 01:20:42,008
that's the most extraordinary
stuff l've ever tasted.

873
01:20:42,130 --> 01:20:45,281
- lt's shattering.
- Well, l think it's rather good.

874
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:51,400
Well, with your permission, sir,
l think l'll all on kive.

875
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:54,687
Call on lves.

876
01:21:03,850 --> 01:21:05,727
Cheers, Hendley!

877
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:15,447
You know what that is?

878
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:17,720
l'll tell you what it isn't.

879
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:20,080
lt isn't Napoleon brandy.

880
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:23,447
How do you like it, sir?

881
01:21:24,450 --> 01:21:26,281
Well, it's...

882
01:21:26,410 --> 01:21:28,287
To the colonies.

883
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:30,287
lndependence.

884
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:39,928
How are you managing over there without
us? Getting along all right, are you?

885
01:21:40,050 --> 01:21:42,962
We seem to be getting along all right,
shir... sir.

886
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:53,159
Yes, well, it's...

887
01:21:54,370 --> 01:21:56,247
lt's good stuff, Hilts.

888
01:21:58,490 --> 01:22:00,367
Thank you, sir.

889
01:22:19,850 --> 01:22:21,727
Danny! Here's to...

890
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:31,358
Roger, goons in 105.

891
01:22:32,130 --> 01:22:34,086
- Who?
- Strachwitz.

892
01:22:37,170 --> 01:22:41,925
We have to ignore it. lf we pay attention,
the goons'll know the hut's important.

893
01:22:42,930 --> 01:22:44,761
Here's to going home.

894
01:22:59,170 --> 01:23:02,287
Come on, Danny.
They've searched it a hundred times.

895
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:04,287
Home!

896
01:23:16,370 --> 01:23:20,158
Anyway, l'm glad we've got you
in the tunnel with us. To Tom, eh?

897
01:23:22,730 --> 01:23:26,484
Och, never mind. You'll be walking down
Argyle Street in a couple of weeks.

898
01:23:26,610 --> 01:23:31,161
To Tom. You know, Sandy,
l'm just beginning to realise that myself.

899
01:23:31,290 --> 01:23:34,123
Why shouldn't you, man?
We're nearly at the trees, boy.

900
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:36,161
We're nearly at the trees, eh?

901
01:24:21,570 --> 01:24:23,481
Herr Hauptfeldwebel!

902
01:24:24,090 --> 01:24:25,364
Herr Hauptfeldwebel!

903
01:25:02,610 --> 01:25:04,805
Oh, my God! They've found Tom.

904
01:25:18,290 --> 01:25:20,167
lt's the tunnel.

905
01:25:36,330 --> 01:25:38,207
Success.

906
01:26:01,130 --> 01:26:02,358
lves!

907
01:27:10,650 --> 01:27:14,529
Sir, let me know
the exact information you need.

908
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:17,765
- l'm going out tonight.
- Right.

909
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:22,166
Open up Harry.

910
01:27:22,290 --> 01:27:24,804
We dig. Around the clock.

911
01:28:55,850 --> 01:28:58,045
- Cooler.
- Right.

912
01:29:01,370 --> 01:29:04,089
Well, l didn't think
they'd catch him so soon.

913
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:07,886
He wasn't caught.

914
01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:23,120
Hilts, welcome home.

915
01:30:13,970 --> 01:30:15,005
Danny?

916
01:30:17,210 --> 01:30:19,087
Danny?

917
01:30:21,850 --> 01:30:23,727
Danny?

918
01:30:30,010 --> 01:30:31,887
Are you all right, Danny?

919
01:30:33,650 --> 01:30:35,527
Yes.

920
01:30:35,650 --> 01:30:37,527
All right.

921
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:42,482
All right. Bring some shovels. l'm all right.

922
01:30:45,010 --> 01:30:47,399
For God's sake,
you've left out a whole eagle.

923
01:30:47,530 --> 01:30:49,407
That's impossible.

924
01:30:50,530 --> 01:30:52,407
Yes.

925
01:30:53,090 --> 01:30:55,888
Four days' work up the bloody spout!

926
01:30:57,010 --> 01:30:59,046
l'm sorry, Colin.

927
01:30:59,170 --> 01:31:01,047
lt's all right, Smithy.

928
01:31:02,130 --> 01:31:05,839
lt's getting late.
You push off to bed. l'll pack up here.

929
01:31:05,970 --> 01:31:07,767
All right.

930
01:31:07,890 --> 01:31:10,450
- Good night, Colin.
- Good night, Smithy.

931
01:31:49,090 --> 01:31:51,285
l can't see a bloody thing.

932
01:32:18,290 --> 01:32:22,078
- Your German's very good.
- Thanks, Mac. l've put in a lot of...

933
01:32:22,290 --> 01:32:26,488
Watch it. That's the easiest way to trip up
a suspect. Don't fall for that old gag.

934
01:32:26,610 --> 01:32:29,170
- l'm sorry, Mac.
- OK. But remember, German always.

935
01:32:42,210 --> 01:32:45,964
One, two, three, four, five.

936
01:33:04,570 --> 01:33:05,559
Roger.

937
01:33:10,490 --> 01:33:11,923
No, it's me.

938
01:33:14,210 --> 01:33:16,121
How do you like the old escape suit?

939
01:33:16,250 --> 01:33:18,127
Fine, fine.

940
01:33:20,410 --> 01:33:22,287
Colin.

941
01:33:24,410 --> 01:33:26,640
How do you like mine?

942
01:33:26,770 --> 01:33:29,000
lt looks splendid.

943
01:33:54,410 --> 01:33:56,560
Where are you going?
You'll get yourself shot.

944
01:33:56,690 --> 01:34:00,683
- What's the matter with you?
- l'm going out through that fence.

945
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:05,680
Danny, we're getting out through
the tunnel. We're almost clear.

946
01:34:05,810 --> 01:34:08,529
Please, Willie, let me alone.

947
01:34:08,650 --> 01:34:11,084
l can't go in that tunnel any more.

948
01:34:11,210 --> 01:34:13,519
So l'm going out through the wire.

949
01:34:16,930 --> 01:34:20,525
Danny, think. We're getting out,
but not through the wire.

950
01:34:20,650 --> 01:34:23,528
We're getting out through the tunnel.
lt's finished.

951
01:34:23,650 --> 01:34:25,845
- l go out now.
- No.

952
01:34:26,850 --> 01:34:30,047
Danny, you go through that wire
and you'll get killed.

953
01:34:37,050 --> 01:34:38,927
Don't do that.

954
01:34:41,050 --> 01:34:42,927
Willie...

955
01:34:44,530 --> 01:34:46,646
Since l was a boy,

956
01:34:46,770 --> 01:34:51,002
l hate and feared little rooms,

957
01:34:51,130 --> 01:34:53,200
closets, caves.

958
01:34:53,330 --> 01:34:55,639
Danny, you've dug 1 7 tunnels.
Over 1 7 tunnels.

959
01:34:55,770 --> 01:34:58,000
Because l must get out.

960
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:01,122
l hide the fear, and l dig.

961
01:35:02,170 --> 01:35:05,958
But tomorrow night in the tunnel
with all those men,

962
01:35:06,090 --> 01:35:08,604
l'm afraid maybe this time
l will lose my head

963
01:35:08,730 --> 01:35:11,449
and ruin the escape for everybody.

964
01:35:14,090 --> 01:35:15,967
So l go now.

965
01:35:20,570 --> 01:35:23,403
Danny, l'll see you through the tunnel.

966
01:35:24,770 --> 01:35:28,240
l'll look after you.
l'll stick with you all the way.

967
01:35:29,530 --> 01:35:31,407
All right.

968
01:35:39,330 --> 01:35:41,207
- Good evening.
- Hello, Roger.

969
01:35:42,050 --> 01:35:44,405
Well, how do you think we look?

970
01:35:47,930 --> 01:35:49,682
lt's as bad as all that?

971
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:56,079
Colin, l want first of all to say that without
you, we would not have been ready.

972
01:35:56,210 --> 01:35:59,680
That's all right. l had lots of help.
Lots of very good help.

973
01:36:01,370 --> 01:36:03,247
What's the matter, Roger?

974
01:36:04,330 --> 01:36:06,560
You can't go.

975
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:09,485
- What do you mean?
- l can't allow it.

976
01:36:09,610 --> 01:36:10,087
Why?

977
01:36:10,210 --> 01:36:12,929
You can't see your hand
in front of your face.

978
01:36:13,050 --> 01:36:15,518
You'd be caught before you got 10 yards.

979
01:36:15,650 --> 01:36:17,527
That's ridiculous.

980
01:36:18,530 --> 01:36:21,761
That's ridiculous. Never heard
anything so absurd in my life.

981
01:36:21,890 --> 01:36:25,121
l can see perfectly. l can see perfectly!

982
01:36:25,770 --> 01:36:29,160
l can see... that pin down there.

983
01:36:29,290 --> 01:36:31,850
- Does that satisfy you?
- What pin? Where?

984
01:36:43,130 --> 01:36:46,281
Colin, do you see the foot of the door?

985
01:36:47,490 --> 01:36:48,764
Yes, of course.

986
01:36:50,850 --> 01:36:53,808
Put the pin down there, will you?

987
01:36:53,930 --> 01:36:55,329
All right.

988
01:36:59,530 --> 01:37:00,963
All right. Come on.

989
01:37:01,810 --> 01:37:03,687
Come on. Sit down.

990
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:07,639
Sit down. lt was a good try.

991
01:37:08,890 --> 01:37:12,769
l hate these last-minute letdowns,
but l've only just been told.

992
01:37:12,890 --> 01:37:16,246
- lt's too risky for you.
- Don't you think that's Colin's decision?

993
01:37:16,370 --> 01:37:18,725
- No, l don't.
- Come on, Roger.

994
01:37:18,850 --> 01:37:24,049
We all know the score here.
Well, at least, most of us do.

995
01:37:24,170 --> 01:37:27,207
Your idea of this escape
is to start another front,

996
01:37:27,330 --> 01:37:31,448
to foul up the Germans behind the lines.
All right, that's fine.

997
01:37:31,570 --> 01:37:35,882
But once we get past that wire and have
them looking all over Germany for us,

998
01:37:36,010 --> 01:37:38,319
that mission is accomplished.

999
01:37:38,450 --> 01:37:41,567
Afterwards, we have
some ideas of our own.

1000
01:37:42,690 --> 01:37:44,442
You mean getting home?

1001
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:46,845
- Back to your family?
- That's right.

1002
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:50,167
Do you really believe
l haven't thought about that too?

1003
01:37:50,290 --> 01:37:52,167
l'm sure you have.

1004
01:37:53,330 --> 01:37:55,207
l know Colin has.

1005
01:37:56,210 --> 01:37:58,246
And, Roger, l have too.

1006
01:37:58,370 --> 01:38:00,247
We think we can make it all the way.

1007
01:38:00,410 --> 01:38:04,926
Not Colin. He'd be an appalling hazard
to the escape. That must be my decision.

1008
01:38:05,050 --> 01:38:09,009
Let's talk about hazard.
Let's talk about you.

1009
01:38:09,130 --> 01:38:12,918
You're the biggest hazard we have.
The Gestapo has you marked.

1010
01:38:14,490 --> 01:38:16,720
No one has said you can't go.

1011
01:38:18,130 --> 01:38:20,519
That's true.

1012
01:38:20,650 --> 01:38:22,880
l have thought about the Gestapo.

1013
01:38:24,890 --> 01:38:28,769
But if you're asking me how far
a commanding officer is allowed to go,

1014
01:38:28,890 --> 01:38:30,767
or dare go,

1015
01:38:31,770 --> 01:38:34,079
or should be permitted to play God,

1016
01:38:35,450 --> 01:38:37,327
l can't answer you.

1017
01:38:38,570 --> 01:38:40,288
But l can tell you

1018
01:38:40,730 --> 01:38:44,245
a blind man is an unnecessary hazard
to himself and the whole plan,

1019
01:38:44,370 --> 01:38:47,203
and must therefore be
eliminated from the operation.

1020
01:38:57,810 --> 01:39:02,759
Colin's not a blind man as long
as he's with me, and he's going with me.

1021
01:39:08,570 --> 01:39:10,765
lt's all right with you, Colin?

1022
01:39:12,730 --> 01:39:15,244
Oh, yes. Quite.

1023
01:39:22,570 --> 01:39:28,122
Very well. l'll arrange for your escape
numbers to be altered accordingly.

1024
01:39:29,010 --> 01:39:30,887
Good night, gentlemen.

1025
01:39:37,450 --> 01:39:39,327
Actually...

1026
01:39:40,450 --> 01:39:42,566
he's quite right.

1027
01:39:42,690 --> 01:39:44,567
He's completely right.

1028
01:39:45,170 --> 01:39:47,126
l really shouldn't go at all.

1029
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:50,447
My eyes have been getting
worse and worse lately.

1030
01:39:50,570 --> 01:39:53,846
l think they call it progressive myopia.

1031
01:39:54,410 --> 01:39:57,322
l can see things up here. Close to.

1032
01:39:57,450 --> 01:39:59,805
l can see to work, but...

1033
01:40:02,570 --> 01:40:04,845
you're just a blur.

1034
01:40:04,970 --> 01:40:06,847
l know.

1035
01:40:07,610 --> 01:40:09,919
Oh, hell. We'll make it in great shape.

1036
01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:12,200
Colin, do you have any tea?

1037
01:40:13,290 --> 01:40:15,804
- Yes, of course.
- Then let's have some.

1038
01:40:17,330 --> 01:40:19,207
Splendid.

1039
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:05,286
Hi, Hilts.

1040
01:41:05,410 --> 01:41:07,287
Hey, Mac.

1041
01:41:09,450 --> 01:41:10,883
When?

1042
01:41:11,010 --> 01:41:13,478
Tonight. We thought
they'd never let you out.

1043
01:41:13,610 --> 01:41:15,999
Me, too. Let's get at it.

1044
01:41:16,130 --> 01:41:18,803
- Bartlett's waiting for you.
- l'll be there.

1045
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:28,204
What time?

1046
01:42:30,330 --> 01:42:32,321
Only eight minutes now, Danny.

1047
01:42:36,330 --> 01:42:38,207
You OK?

1048
01:42:47,970 --> 01:42:49,722
Cavendish.

1049
01:42:49,850 --> 01:42:51,249
Griff, down there.

1050
01:42:51,370 --> 01:42:53,247
Goff, there.

1051
01:43:12,370 --> 01:43:15,282
Smith, Foles, third on the right.

1052
01:43:16,090 --> 01:43:19,162
Blythe, Hendley, third on the left.

1053
01:43:47,690 --> 01:43:49,089
There are the lights.

1054
01:43:50,770 --> 01:43:53,000
Right on the tick, Danny.

1055
01:44:02,090 --> 01:44:05,002
Look down the tunnel, Danny. lt's lovely.

1056
01:44:07,450 --> 01:44:10,806
lt's just like Blackpool
at the height of the season.

1057
01:44:12,570 --> 01:44:15,004
You ever been to Blackpool, Danny?

1058
01:44:15,130 --> 01:44:16,768
Yes.

1059
01:44:16,890 --> 01:44:18,767
No.

1060
01:44:19,530 --> 01:44:21,407
l don't know.

1061
01:44:24,730 --> 01:44:26,607
lt's time, Roger.

1062
01:44:38,410 --> 01:44:41,766
Bartlett, MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt.

1063
01:44:45,290 --> 01:44:46,723
lt's all clear, sir.

1064
01:44:55,250 --> 01:44:57,127
All set, Roger.

1065
01:45:09,170 --> 01:45:10,842
Roger.

1066
01:45:10,970 --> 01:45:12,847
Good luck.

1067
01:45:42,490 --> 01:45:44,879
They're coming down
the shaft now, Danny.

1068
01:45:45,010 --> 01:45:48,320
And then they'll be coming
right up the tunnel.

1069
01:45:54,250 --> 01:45:56,206
Willie...

1070
01:45:56,330 --> 01:45:59,288
l can't wait. l must get out.

1071
01:45:59,650 --> 01:46:03,120
Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny!

1072
01:46:29,890 --> 01:46:33,200
What is it, Danny? What's the matter?
Danny! Come here!

1073
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:36,808
Roger? Danny and l'll go later.
We'll take another place.

1074
01:46:36,930 --> 01:46:39,808
Danny, tell me what this is
and tell me quickly!

1075
01:46:39,930 --> 01:46:43,764
This tunnel is mine as much as anybody.
l dug it. l built it.

1076
01:46:43,890 --> 01:46:46,085
l was buried many times.
l go when l want.

1077
01:46:46,210 --> 01:46:48,087
Let me out. Let me out.

1078
01:46:51,330 --> 01:46:53,525
Take him out, Willie. Take him out.

1079
01:47:07,970 --> 01:47:09,847
Danny? What is it?

1080
01:47:10,250 --> 01:47:12,286
Danny, what's going on?

1081
01:47:12,410 --> 01:47:15,447
lt's all right, Sedgwick.
lt's all right. We're going later.

1082
01:47:21,770 --> 01:47:24,330
Danny, it's all right. lt's all right.

1083
01:47:24,450 --> 01:47:28,159
We can take another place in the line.
lt's all right.

1084
01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:30,727
All right, Colin. Down you go.

1085
01:47:31,410 --> 01:47:35,926
Sit down. Feel the top rung of
the ladder with your right foot. Got it?

1086
01:47:36,050 --> 01:47:37,927
Down you go.

1087
01:47:52,610 --> 01:47:54,566
Danny cut out, huh?

1088
01:47:54,690 --> 01:47:57,158
Willie took him up top. Hilts, l...

1089
01:48:09,770 --> 01:48:12,284
- Remember, keep your head down.
- Right.

1090
01:48:28,690 --> 01:48:30,567
Right.

1091
01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:39,002
Bartlett.

1092
01:49:15,730 --> 01:49:17,766
All right?

1093
01:49:17,890 --> 01:49:21,485
- Hold on to yourself. You're 20 feet short.
- What do you mean?

1094
01:49:21,610 --> 01:49:24,283
20 feet short of the woods.
The hole is in the open.

1095
01:49:24,410 --> 01:49:26,719
The guard is between us and the lights.

1096
01:49:26,850 --> 01:49:28,602
How could that happen?

1097
01:49:28,730 --> 01:49:32,086
What the hell difference does it make?
lt's happened.

1098
01:49:45,570 --> 01:49:48,243
- Roger...
- Damn it, Mac! l'm trying to think!

1099
01:49:49,090 --> 01:49:50,967
We could postpone it.

1100
01:49:51,090 --> 01:49:54,207
All the documents are dated today.
lt's now or never.

1101
01:49:58,090 --> 01:50:02,720
One chance. When the guard goes to the
far end, you might be able to move out.

1102
01:50:02,850 --> 01:50:06,763
l think l can make it to the woods,
set up a signal when you're clear.

1103
01:50:06,890 --> 01:50:07,959
What about the towers?

1104
01:50:08,090 --> 01:50:11,400
They're gonna be watching
the compound, not the woods.

1105
01:50:15,610 --> 01:50:18,078
Mac, pass the word.
Send down 30 feet of rope.

1106
01:50:18,770 --> 01:50:20,522
Send down 30 feet of rope!

1107
01:50:22,210 --> 01:50:24,644
Send down 30 feet of rope.

1108
01:50:26,290 --> 01:50:28,246
Send down 30 feet of rope!

1109
01:50:28,370 --> 01:50:29,928
- What?
- 30 feet of rope!

1110
01:50:30,050 --> 01:50:33,565
- What do they want that for?
- How should l know? Get the rope.

1111
01:50:47,890 --> 01:50:52,168
- How's it going? Have you heard?
- Some kind of foul-up, l think, sir.

1112
01:50:52,290 --> 01:50:56,044
- Haven't they moved into the tunnel yet?
- l don't think so, sir.

1113
01:51:17,610 --> 01:51:19,487
He's over there.

1114
01:51:25,290 --> 01:51:27,167
Right. You go first, Eric.

1115
01:51:28,370 --> 01:51:30,679
l'm staying here till we get moving.

1116
01:51:41,490 --> 01:51:43,720
- See you in Piccadilly.
- Scott's Bar.

1117
01:51:43,850 --> 01:51:45,408
Right.

1118
01:51:57,690 --> 01:51:59,009
Thank you.

1119
01:51:59,130 --> 01:52:01,007
- Good luck.
- Right.

1120
01:52:24,810 --> 01:52:26,687
We're moving.

1121
01:52:33,010 --> 01:52:37,128
Danny, they're moving through
the tunnel now. They're getting out.

1122
01:52:39,570 --> 01:52:44,803
When Warsaw fell, you escaped and
came to England because you're a flier.

1123
01:52:44,930 --> 01:52:49,082
You came because you wanted to fly
with us and fight the Germans.

1124
01:52:49,210 --> 01:52:52,043
We can get out now.
We can get back to England.

1125
01:52:53,810 --> 01:52:55,880
lf you don't go through that tunnel,

1126
01:52:56,010 --> 01:52:59,889
everything you've done
will have been for nothing - nothing!

1127
01:53:27,170 --> 01:53:29,047
- Blythe's behind, Mac.
- Right.

1128
01:53:31,650 --> 01:53:33,527
ln here, Colin.

1129
01:53:34,010 --> 01:53:35,887
Sit down.

1130
01:53:40,530 --> 01:53:42,725
You're up, Sedgwick. l'll take over.

1131
01:53:46,090 --> 01:53:49,287
- What have you got in here? A piano?
- That's very funny, mate.

1132
01:53:49,410 --> 01:53:52,129
- You won't get this thing through.
- l'll cope.

1133
01:53:55,730 --> 01:53:58,688
- Was that Sedgwick with his trunk?
- Who else?

1134
01:53:58,810 --> 01:54:00,846
l wish he was home with his kangaroos.

1135
01:54:07,450 --> 01:54:10,601
- We're 20 feet short.
- How the hell...?

1136
01:54:10,730 --> 01:54:13,039
Hilts is on the other end
of that rope in the woods.

1137
01:54:13,170 --> 01:54:17,607
As soon as you feel a couple of tugs,
off you go, but keep Colin low.

1138
01:54:18,650 --> 01:54:20,481
- Good luck, Colin.
- Thanks, Mac.

1139
01:54:30,210 --> 01:54:32,087
What's that?

1140
01:54:32,930 --> 01:54:35,490
- lt's an air raid.
- Oh, God! No!

1141
01:54:35,610 --> 01:54:39,000
The goons'll pull the switches.
We'll lose the lights in the tunnel.

1142
01:54:39,130 --> 01:54:42,281
Come on, Colin. We can get out
when the lights go down.

1143
01:54:54,410 --> 01:54:55,809
Willie.

1144
01:54:56,490 --> 01:54:57,445
Willie!

1145
01:54:59,450 --> 01:55:02,283
lt's an air raid.
Searchlights are out. Come on!

1146
01:55:08,410 --> 01:55:10,287
Get 'em out.

1147
01:55:15,450 --> 01:55:17,281
- lt's gonna give!
- Danny.

1148
01:55:17,410 --> 01:55:20,720
Danny. Danny, it's all right.
Danny, it's the lights.

1149
01:55:22,570 --> 01:55:25,767
Light the lamps down there!

1150
01:55:26,250 --> 01:55:28,844
There's been an air raid
and they've cut the lights.

1151
01:55:28,970 --> 01:55:31,803
Danny, it's all right. Listen to me!

1152
01:55:33,090 --> 01:55:34,967
Danny, look.

1153
01:55:38,210 --> 01:55:42,647
Come on, fellas. Move! Move!
We can get dozens out in this darkness.

1154
01:55:49,130 --> 01:55:51,200
What the hell's going on?

1155
01:55:51,330 --> 01:55:54,003
- You go.
- No. Danny.

1156
01:55:55,850 --> 01:55:57,727
Go.

1157
01:56:04,850 --> 01:56:06,841
- What is this, Willie?
- Danny.

1158
01:56:06,970 --> 01:56:09,040
- ls he stuck in there?
- He's all right.

1159
01:56:09,170 --> 01:56:11,161
Get him out fast.

1160
01:56:13,570 --> 01:56:15,447
Come on.

1161
01:56:17,810 --> 01:56:19,641
Come on, Danny, move.

1162
01:56:35,170 --> 01:56:37,047
Up you go.

1163
01:56:42,770 --> 01:56:44,647
Give me your bag.

1164
01:56:51,130 --> 01:56:53,007
We're on the rope!

1165
01:57:36,490 --> 01:57:39,846
You and l had better get out, or we won't
have a chance of any of the trains.

1166
01:57:39,970 --> 01:57:44,088
lt's moving. We'll just have to pass
the instructions from man to man.

1167
01:57:44,890 --> 01:57:46,642
- Right.
- l'll be right behind you.

1168
01:58:31,530 --> 01:58:33,680
Come on, come on.

1169
01:58:51,850 --> 01:58:52,839
Come on.

1170
01:59:10,570 --> 01:59:12,128
- Hey!
- Don't shoot!

1171
01:59:12,970 --> 01:59:14,801
Don't shoot!

1172
01:59:15,530 --> 01:59:17,327
Don't shoot!

1173
01:59:21,290 --> 01:59:23,281
Get off! We're coming back!

1174
01:59:45,610 --> 01:59:48,602
Oh, boy. There's a hell of a lot
of shooting going on up there.

1175
01:59:48,730 --> 01:59:51,369
Think they've been shooting them
as they came out?

1176
01:59:51,490 --> 01:59:53,720
We would've heard the shots before.

1177
01:59:56,170 --> 01:59:57,159
Pull!

1178
01:59:57,290 --> 01:59:59,167
Wait for me.

1179
02:00:04,450 --> 02:00:06,327
Out.

1180
02:00:26,370 --> 02:00:27,485
Out.

1181
02:01:00,570 --> 02:01:02,561
- How many did he say?
- 76.

1182
02:01:02,690 --> 02:01:03,964
76.

1183
02:01:04,090 --> 02:01:05,648
- 76.
- 76.

1184
02:01:19,450 --> 02:01:21,281
- Dismissed.
- Ten hut!

1185
02:02:15,970 --> 02:02:19,007
Half the guys who missed
their trains are piled up here.

1186
02:02:19,130 --> 02:02:22,202
Ashley-Pitt, Roger, MacDonald, Nimmo.

1187
02:02:22,330 --> 02:02:24,082
Makes quite a group.

1188
02:02:24,210 --> 02:02:27,759
- What do we do?
- Wait for the train.

1189
02:08:17,570 --> 02:08:19,447
Tallyho.

1190
02:09:00,690 --> 02:09:02,567
Tallyho.

1191
02:09:34,130 --> 02:09:37,759
- Are the police on the train?
- The Gestapo are with them. Let's jump.

1192
02:09:37,890 --> 02:09:39,767
All right.

1193
02:09:44,170 --> 02:09:48,243
- l'll tell you when.
- l'd prefer you just to give me a firm push.

1194
02:10:06,930 --> 02:10:09,808
- Are you all right?
- Yes, l'm fine.

1195
02:10:09,930 --> 02:10:12,160
That's quite exciting.

1196
02:10:13,570 --> 02:10:16,403
- lt isn't stopping.
- No, we're all right.

1197
02:11:10,090 --> 02:11:11,967
Switzerland.

1198
02:11:43,730 --> 02:11:44,799
Hey!

1199
02:15:43,090 --> 02:15:43,966
Bartlett.

1200
02:16:40,850 --> 02:16:45,480
- Where were you going, Cavendish?
- l... l hadn't quite decided.

1201
02:16:45,610 --> 02:16:48,283
What information were you
to collect on the way?

1202
02:16:48,410 --> 02:16:49,206
None.

1203
02:16:49,330 --> 02:16:51,924
What sabotage directions
did you receive?

1204
02:16:52,050 --> 02:16:54,280
What have you done with your papers?

1205
02:16:55,970 --> 02:16:59,201
- Papers?
- Forged papers and identity cards.

1206
02:16:59,330 --> 02:17:02,481
Don't be so stupid.
What did you do with them?

1207
02:17:02,610 --> 02:17:04,566
All l did was escape from a prison camp.

1208
02:17:04,690 --> 02:17:08,205
You'd do the same if you'd been
locked up for three years.

1209
02:17:08,690 --> 02:17:12,319
- l wanted to get home.
- l don't think you'll see your wife again.

1210
02:17:12,450 --> 02:17:14,759
You've got the wrong man.
l'm not even married.

1211
02:17:14,890 --> 02:17:17,040
You're wearing civilian clothes.

1212
02:17:18,410 --> 02:17:21,720
You're a spy. Spies are being shot.

1213
02:17:21,850 --> 02:17:25,638
This is my uniform.
l had to recut it when l lost weight.

1214
02:17:27,210 --> 02:17:29,849
l dyed it with boot polish
to cover some oil smears

1215
02:17:29,970 --> 02:17:32,086
l picked up when l was shot down.

1216
02:17:42,330 --> 02:17:45,128
And you lost your insignia
over the years?

1217
02:17:45,250 --> 02:17:47,081
That's right.

1218
02:17:52,010 --> 02:17:54,240
- Look...
- That's all, Cavendish.

1219
02:18:17,890 --> 02:18:19,767
Hello, boys.

1220
02:18:23,530 --> 02:18:25,407
Hello.

1221
02:18:27,610 --> 02:18:29,805
- Hello, Haynes.
- Hello, Cavendish.

1222
02:18:31,290 --> 02:18:33,724
l wish l could say l was happy
to see you again.

1223
02:18:33,850 --> 02:18:36,410
- Just picked up?
- Yes, this morning.

1224
02:18:53,410 --> 02:18:55,799
There's a trainer out there l can fly.

1225
02:18:55,930 --> 02:18:58,490
- Any sentries?
- Yeah, it's gonna be a problem.

1226
02:20:03,730 --> 02:20:08,201
Colin, when l say go,
crank this clockwise.

1227
02:20:08,850 --> 02:20:13,401
When the engine catches, don't move,
or you'll get a mouth full of propeller.

1228
02:20:26,250 --> 02:20:27,239
Go!

1229
02:21:15,650 --> 02:21:17,527
Next stop, Switzerland!

1230
02:22:36,490 --> 02:22:38,526
The Alps.

1231
02:22:38,650 --> 02:22:39,878
Splendid.

1232
02:22:51,170 --> 02:22:55,368
Over this range, then 20 more minutes
and we've got it made.

1233
02:23:21,130 --> 02:23:24,884
- What is it? Petrol?
- l don't know. We're losing power.

1234
02:23:49,330 --> 02:23:51,685
Go that way! l'll follow.

1235
02:24:15,290 --> 02:24:16,325
Hendley?

1236
02:24:20,970 --> 02:24:22,847
Colin!

1237
02:24:26,650 --> 02:24:28,800
Stop! Don't shoot! Please!

1238
02:24:32,690 --> 02:24:36,968
Colin, l'm sorry l fouled things up.

1239
02:24:38,130 --> 02:24:40,007
That's all right.

1240
02:24:40,970 --> 02:24:42,847
Thank you for...

1241
02:24:43,690 --> 02:24:46,602
getting me out.

1242
02:27:41,530 --> 02:27:43,361
Cafe Suzette.

1243
02:28:15,450 --> 02:28:17,327
Hello?

1244
02:28:17,930 --> 02:28:19,807
Hello?

1245
02:28:55,450 --> 02:28:56,849
Resistance.

1246
02:28:56,970 --> 02:28:58,847
Resistance?

1247
02:28:59,370 --> 02:29:01,247
You are English?

1248
02:29:01,890 --> 02:29:03,767
l'm Australian.

1249
02:29:04,650 --> 02:29:09,087
- You can speak English. l understand.
- Bloody good. l'm a British officer.

1250
02:29:09,210 --> 02:29:12,441
l've just escaped from
a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany.

1251
02:29:12,570 --> 02:29:16,324
l'm trying to make my way into Spain.
You understand me?

1252
02:29:16,450 --> 02:29:18,327
Can you help me?

1253
02:29:21,770 --> 02:29:24,125
- l know someone who can.
- Bloody good.

1254
02:30:06,850 --> 02:30:07,999
Good luck.

1255
02:30:08,130 --> 02:30:09,643
Thank you.

1256
02:31:58,050 --> 02:31:59,642
You are English.

1257
02:32:39,410 --> 02:32:41,287
Herr Bartlett?

1258
02:32:48,490 --> 02:32:50,367
Your German is good.

1259
02:32:50,890 --> 02:32:53,085
And l hear also your French.

1260
02:32:54,930 --> 02:32:57,763
Your arms... up!

1261
02:33:32,610 --> 02:33:34,487
Herr Bartlett.

1262
02:33:35,010 --> 02:33:37,319
And Herr MacDonald.

1263
02:33:40,010 --> 02:33:42,080
We are together again.

1264
02:33:42,650 --> 02:33:46,438
You are going to wish
you had never put us to so much trouble.

1265
02:34:01,770 --> 02:34:05,285
- What's troubling you, Roger?
- l'm just a little surprised.

1266
02:34:05,410 --> 02:34:08,720
l expected either a long stay
or a very short trip.

1267
02:34:08,850 --> 02:34:10,681
Yes.

1268
02:34:10,810 --> 02:34:13,165
l have to admit,
l'm a little worried, though.

1269
02:34:13,290 --> 02:34:15,758
l hope to God l haven't
blotted 70-odd ledgers.

1270
02:34:15,890 --> 02:34:18,040
Och, no, no.

1271
02:34:18,170 --> 02:34:21,640
We're all over 21 ,
footloose and fancy-free.

1272
02:34:21,770 --> 02:34:24,568
We'd never have got as far
as we did without you, Roger.

1273
02:34:24,690 --> 02:34:28,524
For what it's worth,
l think you did a damn good job.

1274
02:34:28,650 --> 02:34:31,164
- l think we all do.
- Yes.

1275
02:35:09,330 --> 02:35:12,879
All right. You can get out now.
Stretch your legs for five minutes.

1276
02:35:13,010 --> 02:35:16,320
lt will take hours
before you reach the camp.

1277
02:35:36,490 --> 02:35:42,167
You know, Mac, all this - the organisation,
tunnelling, Tom and Harry -

1278
02:35:42,290 --> 02:35:44,645
kept me alive.

1279
02:35:44,770 --> 02:35:46,647
And even though we...

1280
02:35:48,010 --> 02:35:50,205
l've never been happier.

1281
02:35:51,130 --> 02:35:53,007
You know, Mac...

1282
02:36:31,690 --> 02:36:34,682
1 1 of your men are being returned today.

1283
02:36:34,810 --> 02:36:36,243
Oh, who?

1284
02:36:36,370 --> 02:36:38,440
l do not have that information.

1285
02:36:38,770 --> 02:36:40,726
l...

1286
02:36:41,330 --> 02:36:45,721
l am directed by a higher authority
to inform you that...

1287
02:36:46,810 --> 02:36:50,280
50 of your officers
were shot while escaping.

1288
02:36:51,650 --> 02:36:52,799
Shot?

1289
02:36:53,930 --> 02:36:57,479
Their... personal effects will be returned.

1290
02:37:00,770 --> 02:37:03,284
How many of them were wounded?

1291
02:37:04,050 --> 02:37:07,008
Here are the names... of the dead.

1292
02:37:10,730 --> 02:37:13,244
How many of the 50 were wounded?

1293
02:37:14,370 --> 02:37:16,247
None.

1294
02:37:16,730 --> 02:37:19,039
They - the higher authority -

1295
02:37:20,010 --> 02:37:22,524
only directs me to inform you that...

1296
02:37:25,330 --> 02:37:27,207
that 50 men were...

1297
02:37:32,970 --> 02:37:34,039
l see.

1298
02:37:36,130 --> 02:37:38,121
Addison, John.

1299
02:37:38,250 --> 02:37:40,047
Alladale, Peter.

1300
02:37:40,170 --> 02:37:42,126
Bancroft, Edward.

1301
02:37:42,250 --> 02:37:44,320
Bartlett, Roger.

1302
02:37:44,450 --> 02:37:46,247
Cavendish, Dennis.

1303
02:37:46,570 --> 02:37:48,447
Eldridge, David.

1304
02:37:49,170 --> 02:37:51,047
Felton, William.

1305
02:37:51,970 --> 02:37:53,847
Fanshaw, Arthur.

1306
02:39:14,610 --> 02:39:16,521
l am your guide, senor.

1307
02:39:16,650 --> 02:39:18,641
Spain?

1308
02:39:39,250 --> 02:39:41,718
- Glad to see you're all safe.
- Thank you, sir.

1309
02:39:41,850 --> 02:39:44,239
- How many have been brought back?
- You're the first.

1310
02:39:44,370 --> 02:39:47,442
- Do you know how many got away?
- Not yet.

1311
02:39:47,570 --> 02:39:50,084
What happened to Blythe?

1312
02:39:50,210 --> 02:39:52,440
He didn't make it, sir.

1313
02:39:52,570 --> 02:39:54,720
Roger was right about that.

1314
02:39:55,490 --> 02:39:58,323
l'm afraid Roger didn't make it, either.

1315
02:40:00,530 --> 02:40:04,364
l've just posted the list. They shot... 50.

1316
02:40:04,930 --> 02:40:06,807
The Gestapo murdered them.

1317
02:40:08,050 --> 02:40:09,449
50?

1318
02:40:09,650 --> 02:40:11,527
MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt?

1319
02:40:12,010 --> 02:40:12,965
Yes.

1320
02:40:13,090 --> 02:40:14,443
Danny and Willie?

1321
02:40:14,570 --> 02:40:16,367
No, they're not on the list.

1322
02:40:16,850 --> 02:40:18,727
- Haynes?
- Yes.

1323
02:40:20,930 --> 02:40:22,079
l'm sorry.

1324
02:40:24,050 --> 02:40:27,360
Roger's idea was to get back at
the enemy the hardest way he could.

1325
02:40:27,490 --> 02:40:29,720
Mess up the works.

1326
02:40:29,850 --> 02:40:32,887
From what we've heard here,
l think he did exactly that.

1327
02:40:33,410 --> 02:40:35,401
Do you think it was worth the price?

1328
02:40:36,530 --> 02:40:38,964
That depends on your
point of view, Hendley.

1329
02:40:41,930 --> 02:40:43,807
Yes, sir.

1330
02:41:31,210 --> 02:41:34,998
He is not to be saluted.
He's no longer in command.

1331
02:41:42,370 --> 02:41:44,679
The job just didn't work out, huh?

1332
02:41:44,810 --> 02:41:48,166
- You were lucky, Hilts.
- Lucky? Because l didn't...

1333
02:41:50,490 --> 02:41:52,162
How many?

1334
02:41:52,290 --> 02:41:54,167
50.

1335
02:41:55,250 --> 02:42:00,278
lt looks, after all, as if
you will see Berlin before l do.

1336
02:42:50,690 --> 02:42:52,567
Sir.

1337
02:42:58,970 --> 02:43:00,369
Hey, Hilts!
