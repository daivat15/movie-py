1
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,412
1879. The Civil War is over,

2
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,250
and the resulting economic explosion
spurs the great migration west.

3
00:00:45,328 --> 00:00:49,463
Farmers, ranchers, prospectors,
killers and thieves...

4
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:51,692
seek their fortunes.

5
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:54,497
Cattle drovers turn cow towns
into armed camps...

6
00:00:54,569 --> 00:01:00,064
with murder rates higher than those
of modern-day New York or Los Angeles.

7
00:01:00,142 --> 00:01:03,578
Out of this chaos comes
legendary lawman Wyatt Earp,

8
00:01:03,645 --> 00:01:07,547
retiring his badge and gun to start
a peaceful life with his family.

9
00:01:07,616 --> 00:01:10,141
Earp's friend
John 'Doc' Holliday...

10
00:01:10,218 --> 00:01:12,982
a Southern gentleman
turned gunman and gambler...

11
00:01:13,055 --> 00:01:18,254
also travels west, hoping the dry
climate will relieve his tuberculosis.

12
00:01:18,327 --> 00:01:20,591
Silver is discovered
in Arizona.

13
00:01:20,662 --> 00:01:23,495
Tombstone becomes
queen of the boomtowns,

14
00:01:23,565 --> 00:01:27,626
where the latest Paris fashions are sold
from the backs of wagons.

15
00:01:27,703 --> 00:01:29,431
Attracted to this
atmosphere of greed,

16
00:01:29,505 --> 00:01:33,067
over 100 exiled Texas outlaws
band together...

17
00:01:33,141 --> 00:01:37,874
to form the ruthless gang recognized
by the red sashes they wear.

18
00:01:37,946 --> 00:01:42,610
They emerge as the earliest example
of organized crime in America.

19
00:01:42,684 --> 00:01:46,211
They call themselves
'The Cowboys'

20
00:03:19,831 --> 00:03:23,494
Y'all killed
two Cowboys.

21
00:03:52,397 --> 00:03:56,060
- ¡Detenganse!
- Shoot.

22
00:03:56,134 --> 00:03:59,535
Looks like we win.

23
00:04:13,685 --> 00:04:16,210
Mexican police, huh?

24
00:04:19,624 --> 00:04:23,424
Tell him to get on his knees.

25
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:26,362
¡De rodillas, cabron!

26
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:29,093
¡De rodillas,
dijo, chingada!

27
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:37,407
He won't no kneel, patron.
He is very proud.

28
00:04:37,475 --> 00:04:40,376
- Hey, somebody get
this dick on his knees.

29
00:04:40,445 --> 00:04:43,005
¡Ay, Dios! ¡Ay, Dios!

30
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:45,743
Good shot, Billy.

31
00:04:45,817 --> 00:04:50,481
¡Gracias!

32
00:04:52,123 --> 00:04:55,650
They call me
Curly Bill Brosius.

33
00:04:55,727 --> 00:05:00,187
I'm what you might call
the Founder of the Feast.

34
00:05:00,265 --> 00:05:05,202
So next time we come,
you'd better step aside.

35
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,932
I ain't kiddin' neither.

36
00:05:10,008 --> 00:05:12,943
Un caballo bajando
por la montana...

37
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:16,208
y el que lo cabalgue
ira a la muerte.

38
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:19,546
¡Moriremos!

39
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:22,245
Patron,
he say, uh,

40
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,312
someone will come
to revenge for him.

41
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,120
Something like a, a... sick horse
who comes to sit with him.

42
00:05:28,193 --> 00:05:30,787
He talk crazy.
No entiendo un carajo.

43
00:05:30,862 --> 00:05:33,729
That's not what he said,
ya ignorant wretch.

44
00:05:33,798 --> 00:05:37,063
Your Spanish is worse
than your English.

45
00:05:39,137 --> 00:05:41,628
You go to hell!

46
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:44,937
You first.

47
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:47,500
¡No!

48
00:05:50,815 --> 00:05:54,410
¡No! ¡No!
- What have we got here?

49
00:06:09,768 --> 00:06:12,669
- Hell, let's eat, boys.
Tamales are good, huh?

50
00:06:12,737 --> 00:06:15,262
I guess they knew
we were comin'.

51
00:06:19,677 --> 00:06:23,977
Temor de Dios. Temor de Dios
es lo que ustedes no tienen.

52
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:26,949
¡Muerete, hijo de Satanas!

53
00:06:37,495 --> 00:06:40,157
Hey, Johnny, what'd
that Mexican mean...

54
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:44,531
'a sick horse is
gonna get us,' huh?

55
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:47,571
He's quoting the Bible,

56
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,733
Revelations.

57
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:53,505
Behold, a pale horse.

58
00:06:53,578 --> 00:06:57,537
'The man who sat on him
was Death.

59
00:06:57,615 --> 00:07:01,676
And hell followed with him. '

60
00:07:27,846 --> 00:07:31,043
Move!

61
00:07:32,383 --> 00:07:36,342
- Come on! That's it!
You move!

62
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:39,356
Stupid mule!

63
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:41,392
Come on!

64
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:43,723
Come on!
Come on!

65
00:07:53,238 --> 00:07:55,866
Hurts, don't it?

66
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,639
Now let go of that stud and
go on about your business.

67
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:14,917
Mr. Earp.
My name's Dake.

68
00:08:14,993 --> 00:08:17,723
Crawley Dake, U.S. Marshal
for this territory.

69
00:08:17,795 --> 00:08:20,628
- Forget it. I'm retired.
- Excuse me?

70
00:08:20,698 --> 00:08:24,190
I said forget it.
I don't want the job, and that's final.

71
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:27,727
- I don't think you understand.
- No, you don't understand, Marshal.

72
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:31,832
I did my duty, and now I'd
like to get on with my life.

73
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,469
- I'm going to Tombstone.
- I see.

74
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,538
Easy on the grain, Butch.

75
00:08:34,612 --> 00:08:35,379
Here you go.

76
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,547
To strike it rich.
Well, all right, that's fine.

77
00:08:37,615 --> 00:08:40,448
Tell you one thing, though:
Never saw a rich man...

78
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:43,487
who didn't wind up
with a guilty conscience.

79
00:08:43,554 --> 00:08:47,991
I already got a guilty conscience.
Might as well have the money too.

80
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:50,823
Good day now.

81
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:57,460
That's him, all right.
Boy, I'd know that sour face anywhere.

82
00:09:00,705 --> 00:09:03,640
Virgil! Morgan!
My god!

83
00:09:09,213 --> 00:09:11,704
- Hey, boy! How are you, Morgan?
- Hi, Wyatt.

84
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:14,445
- Well, how do we look?
- Great, both of ya.

85
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,420
- Wyatt, you remember Allie.
- Good God. Well, he'd better.

86
00:09:17,488 --> 00:09:19,581
Allie girl.

87
00:09:19,657 --> 00:09:21,750
- And Louisa. Oh!
- Wyatt.

88
00:09:21,826 --> 00:09:24,920
You're so lovely, darlin'.
I'm at your feet, just at your feet.

89
00:09:24,996 --> 00:09:27,988
I guess it's only right.
Ma always said Morgan's the prettiest.

90
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:32,025
- Yeah, but she doted on the Frowner.
- That's right.

91
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:34,469
- Wyatt.
- Mattie!

92
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:37,599
Mattie, they're already here.
Folks, this is Celia Andon.

93
00:09:37,675 --> 00:09:40,644
- You can call her Mattie.
- Pleased to meet you, Mattie.

94
00:09:40,712 --> 00:09:43,146
It's nice to meet you.

95
00:09:43,214 --> 00:09:46,149
Well, Wyatt, I couldn't find a single
store that had laudanum anywhere.

96
00:09:46,217 --> 00:09:49,880
That's all right, honey.
I sure been dreamin' about this.

97
00:09:49,954 --> 00:09:53,321
God, since forever!
Wait! Look here.

98
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:56,326
I wanna...
Look. Huh?

99
00:09:59,397 --> 00:10:01,865
- Hey, Wyatt...
- Don't talk, just...

100
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:04,993
Yeah.

101
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:07,469
Thank you for this, Wyatt.

102
00:10:07,538 --> 00:10:11,406
- It's all your doin'.
- We'll make our fortune, boys.

103
00:10:11,476 --> 00:10:13,706
Well, come on.

104
00:10:13,778 --> 00:10:16,347
Gracious.
We could be sisters.

105
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,313
Mighty fine.
I wonder where he found her.

106
00:10:19,383 --> 00:10:21,908
Same place we found ours, probably.

107
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:28,358
'Matter, honey?
Did you say you needed some laudanum?

108
00:10:28,425 --> 00:10:31,485
- Yes, I did. Yes.
- I have some right here.

109
00:10:31,562 --> 00:10:34,497
Oh, you're a lifesaver.

110
00:10:34,565 --> 00:10:37,500
Just be careful now.
It's full of hop.

111
00:10:37,568 --> 00:10:40,537
Oh, don't worry. I just
get headaches sometimes.

112
00:10:40,604 --> 00:10:43,505
Hey, Virg, see anything of Doc
while you were in Prescott?

113
00:10:43,574 --> 00:10:46,509
Yeah. He had a streak
when we left, him and Kate.

114
00:10:46,577 --> 00:10:49,341
I miss Doc.
I miss that old rip.

115
00:10:49,413 --> 00:10:52,814
- I don't.
- He makes me laugh.

116
00:10:56,153 --> 00:10:58,087
Yeah!

117
00:10:58,188 --> 00:11:02,648
- That's $500, Holliday.
Are you in or out?

118
00:11:11,835 --> 00:11:16,465
Five hundred.
Must be a peach of a hand.

119
00:11:21,612 --> 00:11:23,807
Oh, thank you, darlin'.

120
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:27,476
Kate! You're not
wearing a bustle.

121
00:11:27,551 --> 00:11:29,746
How lewd.

122
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,654
Come on, Holliday,
you in or out, goddammit?

123
00:11:33,724 --> 00:11:37,319
Why, Ed Bailey, you look like
you're just about ready to burst.

124
00:11:37,394 --> 00:11:41,023
Come on! Come on, show!

125
00:11:41,098 --> 00:11:45,831
Well, I suppose
I'm deranged, but I...

126
00:11:45,903 --> 00:11:48,463
guess I'll just
have to call.

127
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:51,269
Cover your ears, darlin'.

128
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:56,036
Isn't that a daisy?

129
00:11:56,113 --> 00:11:59,139
Why, you son-of-a-bitch!

130
00:11:59,216 --> 00:12:01,184
Damn, Bailey, just settle down!

131
00:12:01,251 --> 00:12:05,347
Shut up! Take your
money and get out,

132
00:12:05,422 --> 00:12:08,050
'cause I'm tired of
listening' to your mouth.

133
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:11,094
Why, Ed Bailey,

134
00:12:11,161 --> 00:12:13,652
are we cross?

135
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,325
Them guns don't scare me.

136
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:21,701
'Cause without them guns
you ain't nothing' but a skinny lunger.

137
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:25,173
Ed, what an ugly thing to say.

138
00:12:25,242 --> 00:12:30,145
- I abhor ugliness. Does this
mean we're not friends anymore?

139
00:12:30,214 --> 00:12:33,843
You know, Ed, if I thought
you weren't my friend,

140
00:12:33,917 --> 00:12:37,011
I just don't think
I could bear it.

141
00:12:54,137 --> 00:12:57,504
There. Now we can
be friends again.

142
00:13:09,253 --> 00:13:12,120
- Touch that gun,
I'll burn you down.

143
00:13:21,098 --> 00:13:24,033
I calculate that's
the end of this town.

144
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:28,595
I had a boy at the hotel pack us up.
The horse is outside.

145
00:13:28,672 --> 00:13:31,800
So that's why you're
not wearing' a bustle.

146
00:13:34,611 --> 00:13:37,910
My sweet, soft
Hungarian devil.

147
00:13:42,553 --> 00:13:45,488
Well!

148
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:51,885
Good evening', then.

149
00:13:55,566 --> 00:13:58,501
Let's not bother
about the luggage.

150
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:46,973
Hyah!

151
00:15:21,518 --> 00:15:24,715
Hey, Morg,
pretty big, isn't it?

152
00:15:27,924 --> 00:15:33,089
Oh-ho, brother, you can smell
the silver in this town.

153
00:15:33,163 --> 00:15:36,155
- Easy.
- Look at these girls over here.

154
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:39,327
- Hi!
- Hello, girls!

155
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:41,837
Hot damn, this burg's jumping'!

156
00:15:41,905 --> 00:15:44,396
Here we go, ladies.

157
00:15:44,474 --> 00:15:48,672
- Isn't that sweet?
- You can say that.

158
00:15:55,185 --> 00:15:58,848
Sheriff.

159
00:16:07,497 --> 00:16:09,863
Newcomers, eh?

160
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:13,266
The name's John Behan,
Cochise County Sheriff.

161
00:16:13,336 --> 00:16:15,600
- Just in town?
- Just this minute.

162
00:16:15,672 --> 00:16:18,750
I'm Wyatt Earp, and these are
my brothers, Virgil and Morgan.

163
00:16:18,751 --> 00:16:20,041
Wyatt Earp. Dodge City.

164
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,273
Gave all that up, Sheriff.
Going' into business.

165
00:16:23,346 --> 00:16:27,680
- Don't even carry a gun anymore.
- Going into business, huh?

166
00:16:27,751 --> 00:16:30,447
Well then, I'm the man to see.

167
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,988
Besides sheriff,
I'm also tax collector,

168
00:16:33,056 --> 00:16:36,457
Captain of the Fire Brigade and Chairman
of the Nonpartisan Anti-Chinese League.

169
00:16:36,526 --> 00:16:38,926
- Ma'am.
- How do you do?

170
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,998
Yeah, a man of many parts.

171
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:46,502
- Say, you folks got a place to stay yet?
- No.

172
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,233
- Like I said, we just got here.
- Well, I also sit on the town lot commission.

173
00:16:50,307 --> 00:16:52,605
Really?

174
00:16:52,676 --> 00:16:57,579
As a matter of fact, we got three
lovely cottages coming up for rent.

175
00:16:57,647 --> 00:17:00,673
I'll throw in a good cleaning,
no charge.

176
00:17:00,751 --> 00:17:02,844
Believe me, Mr. Earp,

177
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:06,184
you're not gonna find a better deal
within town limits.

178
00:17:06,256 --> 00:17:08,690
I don't know,
sounds pretty good.

179
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:12,627
- Well, I'll have my man show 'em to ya.
- Thank you.

180
00:17:19,002 --> 00:17:22,438
Hey, Wyatt,
get on over here.

181
00:17:22,506 --> 00:17:25,339
I want you to meet Fred White.
He's the town Marshall.

182
00:17:25,408 --> 00:17:27,603
- My pleasure.
- Lotta law around here.

183
00:17:27,677 --> 00:17:30,669
- I already met the county sheriff.
- Who, Behan?

184
00:17:30,747 --> 00:17:34,581
He ain't no law. The only real law
around here is the Cowboys.

185
00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:38,815
Cowboys? I had a run-in
with a couple of them up in Prescott.

186
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:41,983
Nobody does nothing' without 'em.
I mean, they're it.

187
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:44,618
There are three of 'em
right over there.

188
00:17:44,694 --> 00:17:49,063
You can always spot a Cowboy.
They always wear those red sashes.

189
00:17:49,132 --> 00:17:51,478
The main fact is the
Cowboys are good for business.

190
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:53,000
About all these saloons?

191
00:17:53,069 --> 00:17:56,129
Oh, that's the real mother lode
here in Tombstone.

192
00:17:56,206 --> 00:17:58,640
All up and down
Allen Street here.

193
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,506
Twenty-four hours a day,
you got liquor, hostesses, gamblin';

194
00:18:01,578 --> 00:18:03,978
making' money
hand-over-fist.

195
00:18:04,047 --> 00:18:08,347
All except 'the Oriental. '
That's a regular slaughterhouse.

196
00:18:08,418 --> 00:18:11,353
Even the high rollers
won't go near it.

197
00:18:11,421 --> 00:18:15,414
That's too bad too.
It's a nice place.

198
00:18:15,492 --> 00:18:18,359
Hell of a waste.

199
00:18:18,428 --> 00:18:21,261
Wyatt?

200
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:23,561
- There he goes.
- Yeah.

201
00:18:25,802 --> 00:18:28,930
Ol' Wyatt.

202
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:35,411
All right, fella,
I'll brace ya now for a little lesson.

203
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:39,006
Put your money on the board.
Five dollars on that six of spades.

204
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,643
Like that.

205
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:46,088
I'm not gonna tell you again.
Get that cigar outta my face.

206
00:18:46,156 --> 00:18:48,784
Howdy, stranger.
What can I get ya?

207
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:51,020
I wouldn't mind
one of those cigars.

208
00:18:51,095 --> 00:18:53,757
I'm about ready to go home.
I wish y'all would stop yakkin'...

209
00:18:53,831 --> 00:18:55,958
- and just play cards.
- Thank you.

210
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:58,968
Kinda nice in here.
You run it?

211
00:18:59,036 --> 00:19:01,231
Milt Joyce: Owner, operator.

212
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:04,741
- Wyatt Earp.
- Yeah, sure.

213
00:19:04,808 --> 00:19:07,538
I said lay off the queen,
you jackass!

214
00:19:07,611 --> 00:19:10,478
I swear I'm gonna
slap somebody now.

215
00:19:10,547 --> 00:19:15,712
Excuse me for askin', Milt,
but... kinda dead in here, isn't it?

216
00:19:15,786 --> 00:19:18,653
- You don't listen too good, do ya?
- See that bird at the faro table?

217
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:21,885
You back that queen again,
you son-of-a-bitch,

218
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:25,053
I'll blow you right up that
wildcat's ass! Do you hear me, huh?

219
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:29,031
He comes bargin' in here one day, slappin'
the customers, wavin' his gun around.

220
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:31,533
He chased out all
the high-class play.

221
00:19:31,602 --> 00:19:35,595
The only trade that comes in here now is
the bummers and the drovers; just the dregs.

222
00:19:35,672 --> 00:19:39,267
Why don't you get rid of him,
get yourself a straight dealer?

223
00:19:39,343 --> 00:19:41,641
Sure, stranger,
that's easy for you to say.

224
00:19:41,712 --> 00:19:44,613
Shit!

225
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,682
Goddammit, Junior, how many times
am I going to tell you...

226
00:19:48,752 --> 00:19:53,649
to keep that damn cigar
outta my face? Huh?

227
00:19:53,724 --> 00:19:54,582
Christ almighty...

228
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,883
...it's like I'm sittin' here playing cards
with my brother's kids or something',

229
00:19:57,961 --> 00:20:00,293
you nerve-wracking
sons-of-bitches.

230
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,824
Is somethin' on your mind?

231
00:20:04,902 --> 00:20:07,837
Just want to let you know
you're sitting' in my chair.

232
00:20:07,905 --> 00:20:10,305
Is that a fact?

233
00:20:10,374 --> 00:20:12,808
Yeah, it's a fact.

234
00:20:12,876 --> 00:20:16,835
For a man that don't go heeled, you run
your mouth kinda reckless, don't ya?

235
00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:20,850
No need to go heeled to get
the bulge on a tub like you.

236
00:20:20,918 --> 00:20:23,785
- Is that a fact?
- Mm-hmm.

237
00:20:23,854 --> 00:20:26,618
That's a fact.

238
00:20:28,192 --> 00:20:31,184
Well, I'm real scared.

239
00:20:31,261 --> 00:20:36,130
Damn right, you're scared.
I can see that in your eyes.

240
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,691
- All right now!
- Go ahead.

241
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:42,865
Go ahead, skin it! Skin that
smoke wagon and see what happens.

242
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:48,207
Listen, mister,
I- I'm getting' awful tired of your...

243
00:20:48,278 --> 00:20:51,543
I'm getting' tired of your gas.
Now jerk that pistol and go to work.

244
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:58,320
I said throw down, boy.

245
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:08,798
You gonna do something',
or just stand there and bleed?

246
00:21:11,735 --> 00:21:14,033
No?

247
00:21:16,306 --> 00:21:18,740
I didn't think so.

248
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:22,643
Here, Milt, a keepsake.

249
00:21:24,381 --> 00:21:28,249
Hang it over the bar.
All right, youngster, out you go.

250
00:21:30,487 --> 00:21:33,047
Don't come back!

251
00:21:33,123 --> 00:21:35,557
Ever!

252
00:21:39,129 --> 00:21:41,495
Well, what do you say, Milt?

253
00:21:41,565 --> 00:21:45,057
Twenty-five percent
of the house take sound about right?

254
00:21:45,135 --> 00:21:47,569
Hyah!

255
00:21:51,508 --> 00:21:54,443
Well, we're off and running'.

256
00:21:54,511 --> 00:21:57,742
Just acquired us a quarter interest
in a game at 'the Oriental. '

257
00:21:57,814 --> 00:22:00,009
- Acquired?
- So to speak.

258
00:22:03,887 --> 00:22:06,481
Now all we gotta do is keep our
eyes on that brass ring, fellas.

259
00:22:06,557 --> 00:22:09,253
You're the one, Wyatt.

260
00:22:09,326 --> 00:22:12,659
Why, Johnny Tyler!

261
00:22:12,729 --> 00:22:15,721
- You madcap!
- Doc?

262
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:19,166
Where you going'
with that shotgun?

263
00:22:19,236 --> 00:22:22,569
I didn't know you
was back in town.

264
00:22:24,408 --> 00:22:26,603
Well, well.

265
00:22:26,677 --> 00:22:29,840
How the hell are you?

266
00:22:29,913 --> 00:22:33,872
Wyatt, I am rolling.
Morgan.

267
00:22:33,951 --> 00:22:36,715
- Doc.
- Virgil.

268
00:22:36,787 --> 00:22:39,551
'Lo, Doc.

269
00:22:39,623 --> 00:22:42,148
Wyatt Earp?

270
00:22:45,696 --> 00:22:49,029
Going into business
for ourselves, Doc.

271
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:52,432
- Wyatt just got us a faro game.
- Oh.

272
00:22:52,502 --> 00:22:55,096
Since when is faro
a business?

273
00:22:55,172 --> 00:22:57,773
Didn't you always say that
gambling's an honest trade?

274
00:22:57,842 --> 00:23:02,976
No, I said poker's an honest trade. Only
suckers buck the tiger's odds all on the house

275
00:23:03,046 --> 00:23:04,322
Depends on how you look at it.

276
00:23:04,323 --> 00:23:07,244
I mean, it's not like anybody's
putting' a gun to their head now, is it?

277
00:23:07,317 --> 00:23:11,720
That's what I love about Wyatt.
He can talk himself into anything.

278
00:23:13,824 --> 00:23:17,885
Oh. Johnny, I apologize.
I forgot you were there.

279
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:20,225
You may go now.

280
00:23:20,297 --> 00:23:23,789
Just leave that shotgun.

281
00:23:27,437 --> 00:23:30,235
Leave it.

282
00:23:31,475 --> 00:23:34,069
Thank you.

283
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:38,141
Sheriff Behan!

284
00:23:38,215 --> 00:23:41,184
- Gentlemen!
- Sheriff,

285
00:23:41,251 --> 00:23:44,914
- have you met Doc Holliday?
- Piss on you, Wyatt.

286
00:23:46,156 --> 00:23:49,319
Mr. Holliday.

287
00:23:49,393 --> 00:23:52,760
Forgive me
if I don't shake hands.

288
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:58,329
- So, how's our little town suit you?
- Fine. Fine.

289
00:23:58,402 --> 00:24:02,099
You know, I was thinking, what this town
could really use is a racetrack.

290
00:24:02,172 --> 00:24:06,404
Really? That's not a bad idea.
Send a signal we're growing' up.

291
00:24:06,476 --> 00:24:10,537
Way ahead of yourselves, aren't you,
boys? This is just another mining camp.

292
00:24:10,614 --> 00:24:14,175
Have you seen how everyone dresses?
Awful tony for a mining camp.

293
00:24:14,251 --> 00:24:16,685
No sir, the die is cast.
We are growing'.

294
00:24:16,753 --> 00:24:20,280
- Be as big as San Francisco in
a few years, and just as sophisticated.

295
00:24:20,357 --> 00:24:24,316
You son-of-a-bitch!

296
00:24:24,394 --> 00:24:26,885
Easy, gents!
It's a private affair!

297
00:24:26,963 --> 00:24:31,923
- Don't raise that iron. I'm gonna have to...
- I'll kill you, you cheap son-of-a...

298
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:37,567
Very cosmopolitan.

299
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:40,269
I know him.
That's Creek Johnson.

300
00:24:43,647 --> 00:24:46,013
Wyatt? Doc?

301
00:24:47,484 --> 00:24:51,443
- Jack.
- What do you say, old friend?

302
00:24:52,689 --> 00:24:55,658
What the hell's that
all about, Creek?

303
00:24:55,726 --> 00:24:59,025
- He crawfished a bet and called me a liar.
- Sheriff,

304
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:03,465
may I present a pair of fellow
sophisticates: Turkey Creek Jack Johnson,

305
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:05,558
Texas Jack Vermillion.

306
00:25:05,635 --> 00:25:09,196
Watch your ear, Creek.

307
00:25:09,272 --> 00:25:13,433
- Afraid I'll have to have those guns.
- It was a fair fight. We were legal

308
00:25:13,509 --> 00:25:16,345
I'm sorry, boys.
I gotta take 'em before Judge Spicer.

309
00:25:16,413 --> 00:25:18,938
Hand 'em over.

310
00:25:19,015 --> 00:25:21,313
Law and order every time,
that's us.

311
00:25:24,788 --> 00:25:28,053
Ha!

312
00:25:31,828 --> 00:25:34,763
Whoa!

313
00:25:36,266 --> 00:25:38,564
I'm frightfully thirsty.

314
00:25:38,635 --> 00:25:41,570
Well, we made it.

315
00:25:46,343 --> 00:25:49,176
Sheriff,
what kinda town is this?

316
00:25:52,516 --> 00:25:55,314
Nice scenery.

317
00:25:59,856 --> 00:26:02,723
Well,

318
00:26:02,793 --> 00:26:05,853
an enchanted moment.

319
00:26:10,801 --> 00:26:15,204
Interesting little scene. I wonder
who that tall drink of water is.

320
00:26:15,272 --> 00:26:19,003
My dear, you have set your gaze
upon the quintessential frontier type.

321
00:26:19,075 --> 00:26:23,136
Note the lean silhouette, eyes closed
by the sun; they're sharp as a hawk.

322
00:26:23,213 --> 00:26:27,582
He's got the look of
both predator... and prey.

323
00:26:27,651 --> 00:26:29,983
I want one.

324
00:26:30,053 --> 00:26:32,647
Happy hunting.

325
00:27:00,617 --> 00:27:02,915
Hey, sister boy, gimme some!

326
00:27:02,986 --> 00:27:06,149
- Gimme, gimme, gimme!
- Leave him alone, Barnes!

327
00:27:06,223 --> 00:27:09,124
Billy, sit with me.

328
00:27:15,932 --> 00:27:19,834
This is so much fun. We haven't
been to the show in six years.

329
00:27:19,903 --> 00:27:22,531
I hope they're good.

330
00:27:24,841 --> 00:27:27,503
- Wyatt?
- Oh, sorry.

331
00:27:30,914 --> 00:27:34,281
Darlin', you know the Earps.

332
00:27:34,351 --> 00:27:36,546
Kate, how you been?

333
00:27:38,088 --> 00:27:40,955
Mattie, hmm, ravishing'.

334
00:27:41,024 --> 00:27:43,549
Doc.

335
00:27:45,262 --> 00:27:48,891
Wyatt, I'd like ya
to meet Mayor Clum and his wife.

336
00:27:48,965 --> 00:27:51,900
- Mr. Earp. Your reputation precedes you.
- Mayor.

337
00:27:51,968 --> 00:27:56,064
- I was wondering if you might be...
- Not a prayer. Nice meeting' you.

338
00:28:08,952 --> 00:28:13,685
Professor Gillman? Oh, I seen him
in Bisbee. He catches stuff.

339
00:28:13,757 --> 00:28:16,248
Hey, Professor,
catch this.

340
00:28:18,328 --> 00:28:21,092
They're shooting at us!
They're actually shooting at us.

341
00:28:21,164 --> 00:28:25,100
- I guess we'll have
to wait for our notices.

342
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:30,103
Prettiest man I ever saw.

343
00:28:30,173 --> 00:28:31,902
Whoo!

344
00:28:31,975 --> 00:28:34,569
- Whoo-hoo!
- Ladies and gentlemen,

345
00:28:34,644 --> 00:28:37,306
the St. Crispin's Day
speech from Henry V.

346
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,315
To set the scene...

347
00:28:40,383 --> 00:28:42,544
Goddamn, Barnes!
- Shot his damn ear off.

348
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:45,383
'If we are marked to die,

349
00:28:45,455 --> 00:28:47,889
'we are now to do
our country loss.

350
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:53,055
But if to live, the fewer men,
the greater share of honor... '

351
00:28:53,129 --> 00:28:56,326
He's got some nerve, I'll say that.
What d'ya think there, Billy Nilly?

352
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:00,233
I think he's wonderful.

353
00:29:00,303 --> 00:29:02,271
'... gentle his condition.

354
00:29:02,339 --> 00:29:05,797
'Gentlemen in England now abed shall think
themselves accurs'd they were not here,

355
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:09,778
'And hold their manhoods cheap...

356
00:29:09,846 --> 00:29:14,180
whilst any speaks who fought with us
upon Saint Crispin's day. '

357
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:17,084
- That's great!
That's our kinda stuff!

358
00:29:25,095 --> 00:29:27,495
Play it again!

359
00:29:36,907 --> 00:29:39,774
Now what in the hell is this?

360
00:29:39,843 --> 00:29:44,837
Th-That's Faust.
H- He's gonna make a deal with the devil.

361
00:29:44,915 --> 00:29:48,214
Is your soul
for sale, dear?

362
00:30:02,198 --> 00:30:04,632
Know what I'd do?

363
00:30:04,701 --> 00:30:08,330
I'd take the deal, then crawfish
and drill that old devil in the ass.

364
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:14,477
How 'bout you, Juanito?
What would you do?

365
00:30:16,012 --> 00:30:19,641
I already did it.

366
00:30:37,834 --> 00:30:40,860
Very instructive.

367
00:30:42,272 --> 00:30:45,503
Hmm.

368
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,176
But who is the devil?

369
00:31:01,825 --> 00:31:04,316
I'll be damned.

370
00:31:05,629 --> 00:31:08,496
You may indeed,
if you get lucky.

371
00:31:12,836 --> 00:31:15,771
Would you look
at all those stars?

372
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:20,037
I mean, you look up and you think,
'God made all of that?

373
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:23,671
He still remembered to make
a little speck like me. '

374
00:31:23,747 --> 00:31:26,682
Kinda flattering,
really.

375
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,480
Wyatt, do you
believe in God?

376
00:31:29,552 --> 00:31:32,578
- No, come on, really. Do ya?
- Yeah. Maybe.

377
00:31:32,656 --> 00:31:35,921
- Hell, I don't know.
- Well, what d'you think happens when you die?

378
00:31:35,992 --> 00:31:38,756
Something'. Nothing'.
Hell, I don't know.

379
00:31:38,828 --> 00:31:41,729
Well, I read this book,
a book on spiritualism.

380
00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:44,266
Oh, God, here
he goes again.

381
00:31:44,334 --> 00:31:47,269
Said that a lot of people
when they die, they see this light.

382
00:31:47,337 --> 00:31:49,771
- Like in a tunnel.
- Yeah?

383
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:51,706
They say it's the light
leading' you to Heaven.

384
00:31:51,707 --> 00:31:52,774
Really?

385
00:31:52,842 --> 00:31:55,290
Well, what about Hell?
They got a sign there, or what?

386
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:56,403
Hey, Wyatt, goddammit.

387
00:31:56,479 --> 00:31:59,915
- I'm serious.
- Hey, Morg. Comin' to the Oriental, Virg?

388
00:31:59,983 --> 00:32:02,281
- Well...
- Not tonight.

389
00:32:02,352 --> 00:32:05,219
Tonight, me and my old man
are gonna have some fun.

390
00:32:05,288 --> 00:32:07,552
Come on, get moving',
old man.

391
00:32:07,624 --> 00:32:10,559
Maiden name was Sullivan.

392
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:16,099
Well, you better go with them, honey.
I gotta go to work.

393
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,033
Please stay with me.

394
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:21,593
Well, honey, I-I
gotta get to work.

395
00:32:21,671 --> 00:32:24,868
All right.
All right.

396
00:32:24,941 --> 00:32:28,342
Well, wait a minute. I guess
I don't have to go right now. I...

397
00:32:28,411 --> 00:32:31,403
- I could stay awhile.
- No, no. I don't wanna keep you.

398
00:32:31,481 --> 00:32:34,006
No, really,
I can stay awhile.

399
00:32:34,084 --> 00:32:38,714
That the bottle
Lou gave you?

400
00:32:38,788 --> 00:32:41,222
Yes, it is.

401
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:43,555
Maybe you should
see a doctor.

402
00:32:45,995 --> 00:32:48,429
Wyatt, it's
just headaches.

403
00:32:48,498 --> 00:32:51,865
I know what I'm doing. No,
I don't need to see a doctor!

404
00:32:51,935 --> 00:32:54,495
- All right, honey. Okay.
- Just go.

405
00:32:54,571 --> 00:32:57,438
Everything's fine, Wyatt.

406
00:32:57,507 --> 00:33:00,601
- Work well.
- All right, good night.

407
00:33:02,812 --> 00:33:05,645
You look beautiful tonight.

408
00:33:05,715 --> 00:33:08,343
Thank you.

409
00:33:10,954 --> 00:33:13,889
- Night, Mattie.
- Good night, Morgan.

410
00:33:16,626 --> 00:33:18,856
Come on.

411
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:25,796
- I want to match
seven, seven stinking' spades.

412
00:33:25,869 --> 00:33:28,303
- Let's go.
- I'm your man.

413
00:33:28,371 --> 00:33:31,340
You win again. Well played, sir.
You are on fire.

414
00:33:31,407 --> 00:33:34,069
- I told you, I'm burning' up tonight.
- Loser on the ace.

415
00:33:34,144 --> 00:33:37,079
I'll take the red seven,
and I got some deeds here.

416
00:33:37,147 --> 00:33:40,742
- I'll take seven stinking' diamonds.
- Awww-ful lot of money.

417
00:33:40,817 --> 00:33:42,980
You can't stand the heat, pal,
get out of the kitchen.

418
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:44,082
You're the doctor.

419
00:33:44,154 --> 00:33:46,486
Sad news, friend,
you lose.

420
00:33:46,556 --> 00:33:50,287
- So, now we're in the mining business.
- You're the one, Wyatt.

421
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,954
We're turning' into
regular tycoons.

422
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:56,328
Think I'll call this one the Mattie
Blalock. Mattie'd get a kick outta that one.

423
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,027
- That's her maiden name.
- And what a maiden.

424
00:33:59,102 --> 00:34:02,037
- Pure as the driven snow, I'm sure.
- Hey, Doc, come on now.

425
00:34:02,105 --> 00:34:05,563
It's just his style, Morg.
He doesn't mean anything.

426
00:34:05,642 --> 00:34:08,270
Tell me something,
my friend. I'm curious.

427
00:34:08,344 --> 00:34:12,747
Do you actually consider yourself
a married man, forsaking all others?

428
00:34:12,816 --> 00:34:14,977
Yeah, pretty much.

429
00:34:15,051 --> 00:34:18,919
I mean, I was no angel
when we met, but neither was she.

430
00:34:18,988 --> 00:34:23,448
People can change, Doc.
Sooner or later, you gotta grow up.

431
00:34:23,526 --> 00:34:25,892
I see.

432
00:34:25,962 --> 00:34:29,728
And what would you do,
if she walked in here?

433
00:34:29,799 --> 00:34:34,259
- 'She'?
- You know damn well who I mean.

434
00:34:34,337 --> 00:34:37,101
That dusky-hued
lady satan, that's who.

435
00:34:37,173 --> 00:34:39,437
- Oh, I'd probably ignore her.
- Ignore her?

436
00:34:39,509 --> 00:34:42,444
I'd ignore her.
People can change, Doc.

437
00:34:42,512 --> 00:34:44,878
I'll remember
you said that.

438
00:34:44,948 --> 00:34:47,280
What?

439
00:34:50,253 --> 00:34:54,155
- Bravo! Bravo!
- Ma'am? Miss Marcus?

440
00:34:54,224 --> 00:34:56,954
Aw, hell.

441
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:01,820
Bravo!

442
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,937
Whoo!

443
00:35:20,817 --> 00:35:24,014
Miss Marcus, allow me
the pleasure of a drink.

444
00:35:24,087 --> 00:35:27,056
- Thank you, sir.
- Milt, champagne!

445
00:35:27,123 --> 00:35:29,216
Satisfied?

446
00:35:29,292 --> 00:35:32,887
I stand corrected, Wyatt.
You're an oak.

447
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:47,275
Thanks, Kate.

448
00:35:55,785 --> 00:35:58,117
Mr. Fabian.

449
00:35:58,188 --> 00:36:00,019
- Well done.
- Well done.

450
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,058
Good show, partner,
good show.

451
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:04,685
Mr. Fabian, would you
come sit at my table?

452
00:36:06,296 --> 00:36:10,563
Mr. Earp, would you mind signing
an autograph for me, sir?

453
00:36:10,633 --> 00:36:14,967
My wife's not gonna
believe this.

454
00:36:19,008 --> 00:36:22,569
Wyatt Earp, huh?
Heard of you.

455
00:36:24,013 --> 00:36:27,278
Listen now,
Mr. Kansas Law Dog.

456
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:30,410
Law don't go around here.
Savvy?

457
00:36:30,487 --> 00:36:33,422
- I'm retired.
- Good.

458
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:36,288
That's real good.

459
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:40,796
Yeah. Yeah, that's real good, law dog,
'cause law just don't go around here.

460
00:36:40,864 --> 00:36:44,630
Yeah, I heard you the first time.
Winner to the king. Five hundred dollars.

461
00:36:48,872 --> 00:36:53,639
- Shut up, Ike.
- You must be Doc Holliday.

462
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,611
That's the rumor.

463
00:36:56,679 --> 00:37:00,513
You retired too?

464
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:03,746
Not me.
I'm in my prime.

465
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,812
Yeah, you look it.

466
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:11,384
Uh, you must be Ringo.

467
00:37:11,461 --> 00:37:14,362
Look, darlin',
Johnny Ringo,

468
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:19,424
the deadliest pistoleer
since Wild Bill, they say.

469
00:37:19,502 --> 00:37:23,302
What do you think, darlin',
should I hate him?

470
00:37:23,373 --> 00:37:26,604
- You don't even know him.
- No. That's true,

471
00:37:26,676 --> 00:37:30,635
but... I don't know, there's
just something' about him.

472
00:37:30,713 --> 00:37:34,012
Something' 'round the eyes.

473
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:37,177
I don't know.

474
00:37:37,253 --> 00:37:40,484
Reminds me of...

475
00:37:40,557 --> 00:37:42,957
me.

476
00:37:43,026 --> 00:37:46,427
No. I'm sure of it,
I hate him.

477
00:37:46,496 --> 00:37:48,794
He's drunk.

478
00:37:48,865 --> 00:37:51,663
In vino veritas.

479
00:37:51,734 --> 00:37:56,103
Age quod agis.

480
00:38:08,218 --> 00:38:10,982
In pace requiescat.

481
00:38:11,054 --> 00:38:16,014
Come on, boys, we don't want any
trouble in here, not in any language.

482
00:38:16,092 --> 00:38:18,322
That's Latin, darlin'.

483
00:38:18,394 --> 00:38:21,557
Evidently, Mr. Ringo's
an educated man.

484
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:24,156
Now I really hate him.

485
00:38:25,268 --> 00:38:28,726
Watch it, Johnny.

486
00:38:28,805 --> 00:38:31,865
I hear he's real fast.

487
00:38:39,249 --> 00:38:42,184
Come on. Go, Johnny.

488
00:39:02,005 --> 00:39:05,099
Yeah!

489
00:39:44,914 --> 00:39:46,575
Bravo!

490
00:39:55,892 --> 00:39:58,156
- Drinks are on me!
- Whoo!

491
00:40:05,068 --> 00:40:07,593
Getting' kinda spooky
around here.

492
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:10,104
- Curly Bill, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

493
00:40:10,173 --> 00:40:13,973
- Who was that other idiot?
- Ike Clanton.

494
00:40:14,043 --> 00:40:17,843
- Table's open!
- The man dealing faro, who is he?

495
00:40:17,914 --> 00:40:23,181
That's Wyatt Earp. Built a name for
himself as a peace officer in Kansas.

496
00:40:23,252 --> 00:40:26,517
Hmm, peace officer.

497
00:40:26,589 --> 00:40:29,023
Very impressive.

498
00:40:31,194 --> 00:40:33,958
I believe he's married.

499
00:40:36,265 --> 00:40:38,358
More champagne?

500
00:40:55,284 --> 00:40:58,219
Oh, hell.

501
00:41:06,062 --> 00:41:09,259
- Hello.
- Hello.

502
00:41:09,332 --> 00:41:11,994
We've, uh, we've never actually met.
My name is...

503
00:41:12,068 --> 00:41:14,263
Wyatt Earp.
Yes, I know.

504
00:41:14,337 --> 00:41:16,601
- I'm Jos...
- Josephine Marcus.

505
00:41:16,672 --> 00:41:19,140
Everybody knows.

506
00:41:20,343 --> 00:41:23,107
I was beginning to think
we'd never meet.

507
00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:26,376
This is fortuitous.
That means 'lucky. '

508
00:41:26,449 --> 00:41:29,111
Yeah, I...
I know what it means.

509
00:41:29,185 --> 00:41:31,380
Easy now.

510
00:41:31,454 --> 00:41:34,355
- What is it?
- That mare is in season.

511
00:41:34,424 --> 00:41:37,791
Bet she's starting.

512
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:42,524
- How do they know?
- They know. It's the scent.

513
00:41:42,598 --> 00:41:44,463
Ah!

514
00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:48,453
Well, I guess we'd better
split 'em up. It's been real n...

515
00:41:48,454 --> 00:41:49,566
I have a better idea.

516
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:51,869
Let's run it out of them.

517
00:41:54,477 --> 00:41:56,945
Yeah, I'm an oak,
all right.

518
00:42:37,086 --> 00:42:40,021
Whoa!

519
00:42:40,089 --> 00:42:43,024
Well, end of the road.

520
00:42:43,092 --> 00:42:45,617
- Maybe for you. Hyah!
- Hyah!

521
00:43:05,982 --> 00:43:08,280
That was lovely.

522
00:43:08,351 --> 00:43:11,377
Lovely? You could've been
killed back there, or busted up.

523
00:43:11,454 --> 00:43:13,581
Fun, though,
wasn't it?

524
00:43:13,656 --> 00:43:16,591
- You'd die for fun?
- Wouldn't you?

525
00:43:18,828 --> 00:43:21,592
Oh, he's laughing. I didn't
think you ever laughed.

526
00:43:21,664 --> 00:43:24,030
Yeah, I...
I laugh sometimes.

527
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,902
Yes, but how often?
Are you happy?

528
00:43:27,035 --> 00:43:31,972
Am I happy? Well, I don't know.
I'm happy as the next man, I guess.

529
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,032
I don't laugh all day long like
an idiot, if that's what you mean.

530
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:38,341
- Touchy about it, aren't you?
- No, I'm not touchy. I'm just...

531
00:43:38,413 --> 00:43:43,043
It's a silly question, is all. 'Am I
happy? Are you happy? ' Are you happy?

532
00:43:43,118 --> 00:43:46,178
Oh, I'm always happy,
unless I'm bored.

533
00:43:46,254 --> 00:43:49,189
That blonde woman,
is that your wife?

534
00:43:50,292 --> 00:43:52,726
What about her?

535
00:43:52,794 --> 00:43:56,730
Nothing. What do you
want out of life?

536
00:43:58,366 --> 00:44:00,800
Geez!

537
00:44:00,869 --> 00:44:03,531
- How do you get these questions?
- Just answer.

538
00:44:03,605 --> 00:44:06,039
I don't know!
Make some money, I guess.

539
00:44:06,107 --> 00:44:09,668
- Maybe... have some children.
- Doesn't suit you.

540
00:44:09,744 --> 00:44:13,578
- Well, how would you know?
- It just doesn't, that's all.

541
00:44:13,648 --> 00:44:17,414
I oughta know my own mind, and I'm telling
you what suits me is a family and kids.

542
00:44:17,485 --> 00:44:20,454
Suits me right down to the ground.
In fact, that's my idea of heaven.

543
00:44:20,522 --> 00:44:24,322
- All right, what's your idea of heaven?
- Room service.

544
00:44:25,961 --> 00:44:30,625
Oh, he's laughing again.
Well, that's what I want.

545
00:44:30,699 --> 00:44:34,601
I wanna move and go places
and never look back.

546
00:44:34,669 --> 00:44:37,103
Just have fun, forever.

547
00:44:37,172 --> 00:44:41,302
That's my idea of heaven.
Need someone to share it with, though.

548
00:44:41,376 --> 00:44:44,072
You mean Behan.

549
00:44:47,248 --> 00:44:50,115
Well, then...

550
00:44:50,185 --> 00:44:52,915
Why are you with him?

551
00:44:52,988 --> 00:44:56,947
Because he's handsome
and he's charming and...

552
00:44:57,025 --> 00:45:00,859
He's all right.
For now.

553
00:45:00,929 --> 00:45:03,420
Oh, I know, don't say it,
I'm rotten.

554
00:45:03,498 --> 00:45:07,195
I've tried to be good.
It's just so boring.

555
00:45:07,268 --> 00:45:09,736
The way you talk.

556
00:45:09,804 --> 00:45:13,103
Never heard a woman
talk like that?

557
00:45:14,576 --> 00:45:16,874
Never.

558
00:45:16,945 --> 00:45:21,405
I don't have time to be proper.
I wanna live.

559
00:45:21,483 --> 00:45:24,179
I'm a woman.
I like men.

560
00:45:24,252 --> 00:45:28,621
If that means I'm not ladylike,
then I guess I'm just not a lady.

561
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:32,421
- At least, I'm honest.
- You're different.

562
00:45:32,494 --> 00:45:34,587
There's no arguin' that.

563
00:45:34,662 --> 00:45:38,291
But you're a lady,
all right.

564
00:45:38,366 --> 00:45:41,733
I'll take my oath on it.

565
00:45:46,741 --> 00:45:49,175
Giddap! Come on!

566
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:09,557
Is that the opium
Lou gave you?

567
00:46:11,466 --> 00:46:14,993
It's a new bottle,
isn't it?

568
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:18,005
You better go easy
on that stuff.

569
00:46:18,073 --> 00:46:21,565
Wyatt, leave me alone.

570
00:46:21,643 --> 00:46:25,135
- And where've you been?
- Just out.

571
00:46:25,213 --> 00:46:28,148
- Hmm.
- Ridin'.

572
00:46:31,953 --> 00:46:35,889
How're you feelin', Mattie?

573
00:46:38,059 --> 00:46:41,426
Uh, uh...
I don't know. Uh...

574
00:46:41,496 --> 00:46:43,691
I'm all right.

575
00:46:44,966 --> 00:46:47,833
I'm fine.

576
00:46:47,902 --> 00:46:50,894
- You sure?
- Su... I'm sure.

577
00:46:52,307 --> 00:46:56,539
Well, I was
thinking' today,

578
00:46:56,611 --> 00:46:59,546
we've already made
a pile of money in this place.

579
00:46:59,614 --> 00:47:02,606
If we pulled up stakes
and just moved on, you know,

580
00:47:02,684 --> 00:47:05,710
then we could stay on the move,
keep going', see the world.

581
00:47:05,787 --> 00:47:09,518
Just... live on room service
for the rest of our lives.

582
00:47:09,591 --> 00:47:12,059
How'd that be?

583
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:16,223
Room serv...

584
00:47:16,297 --> 00:47:20,427
Wyatt, what're you
talking' about?

585
00:47:23,304 --> 00:47:25,499
Nothing'. I just...

586
00:47:25,573 --> 00:47:28,838
Just thinking' out loud,
and you know I...

587
00:47:30,278 --> 00:47:33,213
Nothing'.

588
00:47:34,649 --> 00:47:37,584
Forget about it.

589
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:53,600
Ow!

590
00:47:56,204 --> 00:47:59,139
What's she doin' with that lunger?

591
00:48:10,185 --> 00:48:13,211
Hey!

592
00:48:14,722 --> 00:48:17,054
Hey!

593
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:21,027
Is that 'Old Dog Trey'?
That sounds like 'Old Dog Trey' to me.

594
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:25,224
Pardon?

595
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,632
You know, Stephen Foster.

596
00:48:27,702 --> 00:48:30,967
'Oh! Susanna,'

597
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:33,564
'Camptown Races. '

598
00:48:35,443 --> 00:48:37,707
Stephen stinking' Foster!

599
00:48:37,779 --> 00:48:40,213
Uh, yes, well,

600
00:48:40,281 --> 00:48:43,341
this happens to be
a nocturne.

601
00:48:43,418 --> 00:48:46,285
- A which?
- You know,

602
00:48:46,354 --> 00:48:49,687
Frederic fucking Chopin.

603
00:48:59,801 --> 00:49:02,235
Oh, yeah.

604
00:49:16,184 --> 00:49:19,119
Boy, I feel great.

605
00:49:20,955 --> 00:49:24,083
I feel... just...

606
00:49:24,158 --> 00:49:27,093
capital.

607
00:49:46,881 --> 00:49:50,715
Yaahhh!

608
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:58,755
- Do you see what's
going on in the street?

609
00:49:58,826 --> 00:50:01,693
- Somebody's gotta do something.
- I believe you're the sheriff.

610
00:50:01,763 --> 00:50:05,927
No, no, no, no. This is not county
business. This is a town matter. Marshal?

611
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,525
Yaahhh!

612
00:50:08,603 --> 00:50:11,629
Why don't you just leave it alone?

613
00:50:11,706 --> 00:50:16,643
No, I, uh...
I gotta do something'.

614
00:50:16,711 --> 00:50:20,374
Wah-hoo-wahhh!

615
00:50:20,448 --> 00:50:22,973
Here's your down card.

616
00:50:42,036 --> 00:50:44,698
Curly Bill!

617
00:50:47,542 --> 00:50:49,908
Come on now.

618
00:50:49,977 --> 00:50:52,445
Well, howdy, Fred.

619
00:50:52,513 --> 00:50:56,574
Hand those over, Curly.
Hand 'em over.

620
00:51:00,455 --> 00:51:02,980
Why, sure, Dad.

621
00:51:04,659 --> 00:51:06,995
I'm only funnin'.

622
00:51:07,128 --> 00:51:09,153
Here you go.

623
00:51:21,743 --> 00:51:24,576
Fred?

624
00:51:24,645 --> 00:51:27,842
Come on now. Fred?

625
00:51:30,752 --> 00:51:34,119
- Got ol' Fred White!
- Hey, everybody!

626
00:51:34,188 --> 00:51:38,318
Better get him
off the street.

627
00:51:38,393 --> 00:51:41,328
Fred White's dead! They killed him.
They killed Fred White!

628
00:51:41,396 --> 00:51:45,560
- All right, back off.
- Get a rope! String him up!

629
00:51:45,633 --> 00:51:48,466
- Nobody's hangin' anybody.
- He just killed a man!

630
00:51:48,536 --> 00:51:51,699
Then he'll stand trial for it.
Now get back! Move!

631
00:51:53,775 --> 00:51:56,801
Turn him loose!

632
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:09,015
He said to turn
loose of him.

633
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:12,856
Well, I'm not; so, go home.

634
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:17,864
I swear to God, law dog, you don't
step aside, we'll tear you apart.

635
00:52:17,932 --> 00:52:21,493
All right, you die first.
Get it?

636
00:52:21,569 --> 00:52:26,871
Your friends might get me in a rush, but
not before I make your head into a canoe.

637
00:52:26,941 --> 00:52:31,401
- He's bluffin'. Let's rush him.
- No... he ain't bluffin'.

638
00:52:31,479 --> 00:52:34,539
You're not as stupid
as you look, Ike.

639
00:52:34,615 --> 00:52:38,346
- Now tell them to get back.
- Go on now, get back.

640
00:52:38,419 --> 00:52:42,116
Go on!
Billy!

641
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:45,887
He'll kill me.

642
00:52:48,596 --> 00:52:52,293
And you, music lover,

643
00:52:52,366 --> 00:52:54,596
you're next.

644
00:52:54,669 --> 00:52:58,127
It's the drunk piano player.

645
00:52:58,206 --> 00:53:01,198
You're so drunk,
you can't hit nothing'.

646
00:53:01,275 --> 00:53:04,711
In fact, you're
probably seein' double.

647
00:53:04,779 --> 00:53:09,239
I have two guns,
one for each of ya.

648
00:53:09,317 --> 00:53:12,411
All right, back it up now!

649
00:53:17,792 --> 00:53:20,090
Go home now!

650
00:53:30,838 --> 00:53:34,569
I'll see you soon.

651
00:53:34,642 --> 00:53:38,100
- I'll see you soon.
- We'll meet again.

652
00:53:43,084 --> 00:53:45,780
Well, as you can see,

653
00:53:45,853 --> 00:53:48,651
never a dull moment.

654
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,213
So it takes Judge Spicer
three weeks to get back to town,

655
00:54:16,284 --> 00:54:19,219
and he says, 'Well,
did you actually see it? '

656
00:54:19,287 --> 00:54:22,779
I said, 'No. By the time I got there,
Marshal White had already been shot. '

657
00:54:22,857 --> 00:54:25,792
Then Spicer leans forward
and he says,

658
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:28,852
- 'Well, can't have a murder
without a witness. '

659
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:31,558
- What?
- Case dismissed. Can you beat it?

660
00:54:31,632 --> 00:54:35,398
After all that?
Aw, hell, who cares?

661
00:54:35,469 --> 00:54:37,937
None of my business anyway.

662
00:54:38,005 --> 00:54:40,633
Ready to go, Milt?

663
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:44,269
God, I love this game!
You know, boys, when we're finally set,

664
00:54:44,345 --> 00:54:47,314
we gotta each have
a billiard room in our houses.

665
00:54:47,381 --> 00:54:49,815
I been thinking',

666
00:54:49,884 --> 00:54:53,081
maybe we oughta open up
a place of our own. You know?

667
00:54:53,154 --> 00:54:56,590
There's the real money. Build it up,

668
00:54:56,657 --> 00:54:59,251
Milk it for all it's worth,
then sell it off for a bundle...

669
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:03,127
and breeze outta this burg with more money
than Cresus and ready to live like kings.

670
00:55:03,197 --> 00:55:06,689
What d'ya think, Virg?

671
00:55:06,767 --> 00:55:09,861
Virg?

672
00:55:09,937 --> 00:55:12,872
Why don't you and me
take a walk around town...

673
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:17,104
and see if we can't spot us out
a couple of nice lots?

674
00:55:17,178 --> 00:55:20,341
It's working' out just
like you said, Wyatt.

675
00:55:20,414 --> 00:55:23,353
Goddamn, boys, we're looting'
this burg six ways from Sunday.

676
00:55:23,354 --> 00:55:24,680
Pretty fun too, isn't it?

677
00:55:24,752 --> 00:55:28,848
- Actually, yeah, I gotta admit.
- Excuse me. Wyatt, do you have a moment?

678
00:55:28,923 --> 00:55:32,950
- Will you just hear me out?
- Now hold on, Mayor. He already told you now.

679
00:55:33,027 --> 00:55:35,120
You tell him, Morg.

680
00:55:35,196 --> 00:55:38,723
What about you?
You were a lawman.

681
00:55:40,835 --> 00:55:43,099
I'm busy.

682
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:45,297
We're all busy.

683
00:55:45,373 --> 00:55:49,537
Sorry, Mayor, but you're
barking' up the wrong tree.

684
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:52,477
You know, you men are making'
a lot of money in this town.

685
00:55:52,546 --> 00:55:55,276
That's good. That's good.
Good for you.

686
00:55:55,349 --> 00:55:58,580
In the meantime, a lot of
decent people are suffering.

687
00:55:58,653 --> 00:56:03,283
But, please, don't let me take up
any more of your precious time.

688
00:56:07,395 --> 00:56:09,556
Rack 'em.

689
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:13,088
I tell ya, I'm suffering.
From a hangover.

690
00:56:20,975 --> 00:56:23,239
Stop that!

691
00:56:23,311 --> 00:56:25,609
Stop. No.

692
00:57:20,935 --> 00:57:24,098
Hold on a minute!
Wait a minute!

693
00:57:24,171 --> 00:57:27,572
Calm down and listen to me!

694
00:57:27,641 --> 00:57:30,576
Nobody's saying'
you can't own a gun.

695
00:57:30,644 --> 00:57:33,738
Nobody's even saying'
you can't carry a gun.

696
00:57:33,814 --> 00:57:37,215
All we're saying' is you
can't carry a gun in town.

697
00:57:41,122 --> 00:57:44,990
That's not so bad,
is it?

698
00:57:49,497 --> 00:57:52,432
Listen, Mayor, I have
to talk to you about this.

699
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:55,731
No, we don't have to talk. You can
read, can't you? It's a town matter.

700
00:57:55,803 --> 00:58:00,604
What in the hell are you doin'?
I told you we weren't getting' involved.

701
00:58:00,674 --> 00:58:03,268
You got us involved
when you brought us here.

702
00:58:03,344 --> 00:58:06,438
Now you hold on
a minute, Virg.

703
00:58:06,514 --> 00:58:10,109
Hold on nothing'! I walk around this
town and look these people in the eyes.

704
00:58:10,184 --> 00:58:13,051
It's just like someone's
slapping' me in the face.

705
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,554
These people are afraid
to walk down the street,

706
00:58:15,623 --> 00:58:18,558
and I'm tryin' to make money off
that like some goddamn vulture!

707
00:58:18,626 --> 00:58:22,062
If we're gonna have a future in this
town, it's gotta have some law and order.

708
00:58:22,129 --> 00:58:24,120
Don't do this to me!

709
00:58:24,198 --> 00:58:26,685
It's got nothing' to do
with you! It's got to do wi...

710
00:58:26,686 --> 00:58:27,861
Nothing to do with me?

711
00:58:27,935 --> 00:58:31,098
I'm your brother, for Christ's sake!
God, I don't believe this!

712
00:58:31,172 --> 00:58:34,630
Talk to him, will you?
Or hit him!

713
00:58:37,545 --> 00:58:39,740
Ah, God, don't tell me!

714
00:58:39,814 --> 00:58:42,248
Like you said, Wyatt,
we're brothers.

715
00:58:42,316 --> 00:58:46,377
Gotta back your brother's play.
Just did like I figured you would.

716
00:58:46,454 --> 00:58:50,254
All right now, you listen
to me, both of ya!

717
00:58:51,692 --> 00:58:54,126
For the first time
in our lives,

718
00:58:54,195 --> 00:58:56,629
we got a chance to stop wandering
and finally be a family.

719
00:58:56,697 --> 00:58:59,666
This is trouble we don't need.
You saw what happened to Fred White.

720
00:58:59,733 --> 00:59:01,963
We know what
we're doin', Wyatt.

721
00:59:02,036 --> 00:59:06,132
Okay, fine. Say you're right,
say you don't get yourself killed.

722
00:59:06,207 --> 00:59:08,971
There's something' else.

723
00:59:09,043 --> 00:59:10,901
All those years I worked
those cow towns,

724
00:59:10,902 --> 00:59:14,208
I was only ever mixed up in
one shootin', just one.

725
00:59:14,281 --> 00:59:17,580
But a man lost his life,
and I took it.

726
00:59:17,651 --> 00:59:20,017
You don't know how
that feels, Morg.

727
00:59:20,087 --> 00:59:23,853
Believe me, boy,
you don't ever wanna know.

728
00:59:23,924 --> 00:59:26,916
Not ever.

729
00:59:33,434 --> 00:59:36,369
Didn't even make a dent, did I?

730
00:59:36,437 --> 00:59:39,770
All right.

731
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,071
You're both making' a big mistake.

732
00:59:48,883 --> 00:59:55,880
# What remained of our day
in the sunshine #

733
00:59:55,957 --> 01:00:02,089
- # That brightened our pathway a while #
- Do you wanna ante?

734
01:00:02,163 --> 01:00:08,932
- Yeah, fine.
- # Come and sit by my side if you love me #

735
01:00:09,003 --> 01:00:15,966
# Do not hasten
to bid me adieu #

736
01:00:16,044 --> 01:00:23,109
# But remember
the Red River Valley #

737
01:00:23,184 --> 01:00:28,588
# And the girl who has
loved you so true #

738
01:00:28,656 --> 01:00:33,491
- What do you think of the singer?
- # Will you think of the vow... #

739
01:00:33,561 --> 01:00:36,621
Nice voice.

740
01:00:36,698 --> 01:00:40,759
Wyatt, Doc won't quit.
He's been at it for 36 hours straight.

741
01:00:40,835 --> 01:00:43,770
Clanton and the McLaury brothers
came in an hour ago.

742
01:00:43,838 --> 01:00:45,434
I tried to get him to go
to bed, but he won't let go.

743
01:00:45,435 --> 01:00:48,935
I know, and nobody can make him.

744
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:57,215
Wyatt, just in time.
Pull up a chair.

745
01:00:57,285 --> 01:01:01,153
Doc, you been hittin' it
awful hard, haven't ya?

746
01:01:01,222 --> 01:01:06,592
Nonsense. I've not yet
begun to defile myself.

747
01:01:06,661 --> 01:01:09,152
I was wonderin' if you wouldn't wanna
go on over to the Crystal Palace...

748
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:11,824
I will not be pawed at,
thank you very much.

749
01:01:11,899 --> 01:01:13,833
- I'm sorry.
- That's right.

750
01:01:13,901 --> 01:01:16,870
Doc can go on day and night,
and then some.

751
01:01:18,673 --> 01:01:23,110
That's my loving man.
Have another one, my loving man.

752
01:01:23,177 --> 01:01:26,112
I'm in.

753
01:01:27,181 --> 01:01:29,115
Straight.

754
01:01:29,183 --> 01:01:32,949
Loving man,
you been called.

755
01:01:40,094 --> 01:01:42,255
Oops.

756
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,830
What is that now?

757
01:01:47,902 --> 01:01:53,033
That 12 hands in a row, Holliday?
Son-of-a-bitch, nobody's that lucky.

758
01:01:54,108 --> 01:01:57,908
Why, Ike,
whatever do you mean?

759
01:01:57,979 --> 01:02:00,709
Take it easy, boys.

760
01:02:02,116 --> 01:02:05,779
Maybe poker's
just not your game, Ike.

761
01:02:07,188 --> 01:02:11,522
I know, let's have
a spelling contest.

762
01:02:11,592 --> 01:02:15,187
- How 'bout if I just wring your scrawny neck?
- Enough, Ike.

763
01:02:16,531 --> 01:02:19,159
Are you taking'
his part? Huh?

764
01:02:19,233 --> 01:02:22,396
I'm the one
who got cheated!

765
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:27,203
You goddamn pimps!
You all in it together.

766
01:02:27,275 --> 01:02:30,676
Nobody's in anything. Ike, you're
drunk. Go on home and sleep it off.

767
01:02:30,745 --> 01:02:33,509
Get your goddamn hands off me!

768
01:02:33,581 --> 01:02:36,106
Don't you ever put
your hands on me, see?

769
01:02:36,184 --> 01:02:39,847
Don't you ever try to manhandle a Cowboy,
'cause we'll cut your goddamn pimp's heart out

770
01:02:39,921 --> 01:02:40,778
Understand me, pimp?

771
01:02:40,779 --> 01:02:43,049
Don't you threaten me,
you little son-of-a-bitch!

772
01:02:43,124 --> 01:02:45,684
All right! All right!
Come on, easy, Virg, easy!

773
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,729
You just go on home and
forget about it, huh, Ike?

774
01:02:48,796 --> 01:02:51,264
Come on, Virg.

775
01:02:51,332 --> 01:02:53,766
I ain't gonna forget nothing'.

776
01:02:53,835 --> 01:02:58,465
Well, that certainly was a bust.

777
01:02:58,539 --> 01:03:03,806
Come, darlin'. Let's seek
our entertainment elsewhere.

778
01:03:03,878 --> 01:03:07,041
Forget it, Virg. Go on.
Get some fresh air.

779
01:03:18,493 --> 01:03:20,427
What's wrong, Doc?

780
01:03:20,495 --> 01:03:22,759
Nothing'. Not a thing.

781
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:25,458
I'm right as the mail.

782
01:03:28,636 --> 01:03:30,900
Doc? Doc!

783
01:03:30,972 --> 01:03:34,169
All right, get him up.
Let's get him to the hotel.

784
01:03:43,217 --> 01:03:45,777
- What's wrong with him?
- Lunger.

785
01:03:45,853 --> 01:03:48,651
Yeah, well, I hope you die.

786
01:03:49,724 --> 01:03:52,249
Give me my guns.

787
01:03:54,295 --> 01:03:56,229
My rifle.

788
01:03:56,297 --> 01:03:59,425
Goddamn bastards.
Think they can cheat me.

789
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,559
Nobody cheated you, Ike.
Just go home.

790
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:06,471
I don't take no mouth
from no bartenders, neither.

791
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:08,475
There, ya see?

792
01:04:08,543 --> 01:04:12,001
Give somebody a rap on the beezer,
get some respect around here.

793
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:16,448
You tell the Earps, I see 'em
on the street and Doc Holliday,

794
01:04:16,517 --> 01:04:20,214
I'm gonna send them to hell
on a shutter. You tell 'em that...

795
01:04:26,227 --> 01:04:28,661
Pick these guns up.

796
01:04:28,729 --> 01:04:30,663
Come on.

797
01:04:45,479 --> 01:04:48,004
Come on, Ike.

798
01:04:48,082 --> 01:04:50,073
Come on!

799
01:04:52,186 --> 01:04:55,019
- Hey, you walking'?
- Leave me alone.

800
01:05:01,529 --> 01:05:04,327
- You gonna give Ike back his guns.
- Not 'til he sobers up.

801
01:05:04,398 --> 01:05:08,164
Wearing' that badge
don't make you right.

802
01:05:08,235 --> 01:05:10,829
Who the hell
you think you are?

803
01:05:14,075 --> 01:05:18,535
- Watch the way you walk, you stupid bastard.
- Easy, kid, I'm sorry.

804
01:05:18,613 --> 01:05:21,241
I ain't easy
and I ain't your kid.

805
01:05:21,315 --> 01:05:24,682
You take your sorry
and shove it up your ass.

806
01:05:27,788 --> 01:05:29,915
I'll fight you right now.

807
01:05:36,464 --> 01:05:38,398
Goddammit!

808
01:05:38,466 --> 01:05:40,434
You're gonna bleed.

809
01:05:40,501 --> 01:05:43,937
You got a fight comin'.
Comin' today.

810
01:05:47,942 --> 01:05:50,877
Bastards! We're comin'!

811
01:05:57,985 --> 01:06:00,510
Your condition's
quite advanced.

812
01:06:00,588 --> 01:06:04,752
I'd say you lost some 60%
of your lung tissue, maybe more.

813
01:06:04,825 --> 01:06:06,759
What's the verdict?

814
01:06:06,827 --> 01:06:11,730
Two years. Two days.
Hard to say, if you stop now:

815
01:06:11,799 --> 01:06:14,700
Your smoking',
your drinking',

816
01:06:14,769 --> 01:06:17,033
your gambling',
your night life.

817
01:06:17,104 --> 01:06:19,902
You need complete rest.

818
01:06:21,308 --> 01:06:25,540
What I mean is,
you must attempt to, uh, deny...

819
01:06:25,613 --> 01:06:30,107
- your, uh, marital impulse.
- Get out of my sight.

820
01:06:48,502 --> 01:06:51,403
- How are you feeling, Doc?
- Mmm, better.

821
01:06:51,472 --> 01:06:53,838
That's good.

822
01:06:53,908 --> 01:06:56,741
I knew it wasn't nothing.

823
01:06:58,045 --> 01:07:00,570
We must talk, darlin'.

824
01:07:01,982 --> 01:07:04,314
It appears, uh...

825
01:07:04,385 --> 01:07:09,687
we must redefine the nature
of our association.

826
01:07:14,161 --> 01:07:17,597
I'm a good woman
to you, Doc.

827
01:07:17,665 --> 01:07:20,225
Don't I always
take care of ya?

828
01:07:20,301 --> 01:07:23,202
Nobody cares for you
like me.

829
01:07:24,305 --> 01:07:26,500
I'm a good woman.

830
01:07:28,042 --> 01:07:32,001
Yes, it's true,
you are a good woman.

831
01:07:44,558 --> 01:07:46,924
Then again...

832
01:07:46,994 --> 01:07:51,598
you may be the Antichrist.

833
01:08:12,285 --> 01:08:14,913
Goddamn.

834
01:08:14,988 --> 01:08:19,516
Now there's six of 'em.
Hell, this is like a bad dream.

835
01:08:19,592 --> 01:08:22,891
Just stay calm. Use your head.
It'll be all right.

836
01:08:26,199 --> 01:08:28,360
Just the same, though...

837
01:08:29,736 --> 01:08:32,705
Guess maybe you better
swear me in.

838
01:09:07,707 --> 01:09:12,110
Those Cowboys been telling everybody
in town they're gonna clean you out.

839
01:09:12,178 --> 01:09:15,636
They're back there in that lot
behind the O.K. Corral.

840
01:09:17,016 --> 01:09:19,541
- Thank you, Mayor.
- What're you doin' out of bed, Doc?

841
01:09:19,619 --> 01:09:22,019
What in the hell's going' on?
Five people come up to my room...

842
01:09:22,088 --> 01:09:26,115
telling' me the Clantons and McLaurys
are gunnin' for us.

843
01:09:26,192 --> 01:09:28,929
We going' down there or not?
What are we gonna do?

844
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:30,754
Wait 'til the liquor wears off.

845
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:33,355
Soon as they start getting' headaches,
they'll lose interest.

846
01:09:33,433 --> 01:09:36,630
Lose interest, hell.
They're threatening' our lives.

847
01:09:36,703 --> 01:09:40,002
- You'll never make that stick.
- They're carrying' guns, Wyatt.

848
01:09:40,073 --> 01:09:42,007
Christ's sake, Virg,
that's a misdemeanor.

849
01:09:42,075 --> 01:09:45,772
You go arrest them, something goes wrong,
maybe somebody really gets his head broken.

850
01:09:45,845 --> 01:09:49,303
You'll have Cowboys comin' around looking'
for trouble from here to Christmas.

851
01:09:49,382 --> 01:09:51,547
You want to risk all
that over a misdemeanor?

852
01:09:51,548 --> 01:09:52,818
Damn right, I'll risk it.

853
01:09:52,885 --> 01:09:55,285
They're breaking' the law.

854
01:10:01,027 --> 01:10:04,428
It's not your problem, Doc.
You don't have to mix up in this.

855
01:10:06,632 --> 01:10:10,432
That is a hell of a thing
for you to say to me.

856
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:23,413
All right, Virg.

857
01:10:25,518 --> 01:10:28,885
Your call.
Give Doc the shotgun.

858
01:10:30,123 --> 01:10:32,250
They'll be less apt
to get nerv-i-ous...

859
01:10:32,325 --> 01:10:34,555
if he's on
the street howitzer.

860
01:11:18,304 --> 01:11:20,238
Hey! Bang bang
bang bang bang!

861
01:11:20,306 --> 01:11:22,934
Go on! Get home!

862
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:26,535
Goddamn kid.

863
01:11:36,956 --> 01:11:40,585
How the hell did we
get ourselves into this?

864
01:11:43,529 --> 01:11:46,692
You don't have to worry about a thing.
I just disarmed them.

865
01:11:46,766 --> 01:11:49,360
You did?
Come on, boys.

866
01:11:49,435 --> 01:11:52,734
Gentlemen, I'm not
gonna allow any trouble.

867
01:12:16,062 --> 01:12:19,554
We're here to disarm you.
Throw up your hands.

868
01:12:23,269 --> 01:12:26,067
Hold it!
That's not what I want!

869
01:13:00,373 --> 01:13:02,307
Oh, my God.

870
01:13:11,083 --> 01:13:13,847
Billy! Billy!

871
01:13:20,459 --> 01:13:22,927
Stop! No! No!

872
01:13:22,995 --> 01:13:25,725
Don't shoot!
I got no gun!

873
01:13:25,798 --> 01:13:29,097
- Please don't shoot me! I got no gun!
- This fight's commenced!

874
01:13:29,168 --> 01:13:31,432
Get to fighting' or get away!

875
01:13:32,905 --> 01:13:35,897
- Unh!
- Shut the door!

876
01:13:40,279 --> 01:13:42,747
Aah!

877
01:13:51,257 --> 01:13:53,657
Give me your goddamned gun!
Damn it!

878
01:13:53,726 --> 01:13:56,194
Billy! Billy!

879
01:13:56,262 --> 01:13:58,594
Doc, behind us!

880
01:14:25,124 --> 01:14:27,649
I got you now,
you son-of-a-bitch.

881
01:14:27,727 --> 01:14:29,661
You're a daisy if you do.

882
01:14:43,843 --> 01:14:46,368
Morgan, hold quiet now.

883
01:14:57,256 --> 01:14:59,850
Here you go.
Easy. Easy, man.

884
01:14:59,925 --> 01:15:02,723
- I got you. All right.
- All right!

885
01:15:04,697 --> 01:15:07,257
All of you
are under arrest.

886
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:21,812
I don't think I'll let you
arrest us today, Behan.

887
01:15:50,576 --> 01:15:52,510
Virg!

888
01:15:52,578 --> 01:15:55,138
Virgil!

889
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:18,236
Well, I guess we did
our good deed for today, Mayor.

890
01:17:42,922 --> 01:17:46,483
You were right.
It's nothing' like I thought.

891
01:17:46,559 --> 01:17:50,051
- I almost wish that...
- I know, Morgan.

892
01:17:51,764 --> 01:17:53,857
I know. Me too.

893
01:18:06,178 --> 01:18:08,305
Outta the way!
Yee-haw!

894
01:18:12,451 --> 01:18:14,419
Getting' warmer.

895
01:18:14,487 --> 01:18:17,047
Guess spring's comin'.

896
01:18:17,123 --> 01:18:19,187
Hello, Billy. I say hello.

897
01:18:19,188 --> 01:18:21,924
It's deputy!
And I don't want to talk to you!

898
01:18:21,994 --> 01:18:24,258
Those men you killed
were my friends.

899
01:18:24,330 --> 01:18:28,426
I'm just a nothing'. But if
I wasn't, I'd fight you right now,

900
01:18:28,501 --> 01:18:30,901
so I don't
want to talk to you.

901
01:18:33,105 --> 01:18:35,437
All they ever did
was laugh at him.

902
01:18:43,950 --> 01:18:47,681
Sister boy should've
stuck around.

903
01:18:49,455 --> 01:18:53,892
- What do you want, Ringo?
- I want your blood.

904
01:18:55,461 --> 01:18:57,861
And I want your souls.

905
01:18:57,930 --> 01:19:00,626
And I want 'em both right now.

906
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:04,067
- I don't want any more trouble.
- Well, ya got trouble!

907
01:19:05,705 --> 01:19:08,799
And it starts with you.

908
01:19:12,378 --> 01:19:14,938
I'm not gonna
fight you, Ringo.

909
01:19:16,248 --> 01:19:18,409
There's no money in it.

910
01:19:18,484 --> 01:19:20,782
Sober up.
Come on, boys.

911
01:19:20,853 --> 01:19:23,287
You wretched slugs.

912
01:19:23,356 --> 01:19:26,757
Don't any of ya have the guts
to play for blood?

913
01:19:26,826 --> 01:19:29,317
I'm your huckleberry.

914
01:19:29,395 --> 01:19:32,796
That's just my game.

915
01:19:39,939 --> 01:19:44,933
All right, lunger.
You go to hell.

916
01:19:45,011 --> 01:19:49,345
- I'll put you out of your misery.
- Say when.

917
01:19:49,415 --> 01:19:53,044
- Johnny, don't!
- No, Johnny! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

918
01:19:53,119 --> 01:19:55,144
- Get off!
- Easy now! It ain't nothing'.

919
01:19:55,221 --> 01:19:57,849
- Get off!
- Don't mind him!

920
01:19:57,923 --> 01:20:00,949
He's just drunk,
that's all.

921
01:20:01,027 --> 01:20:04,155
Cool down, Johnny!

922
01:20:04,230 --> 01:20:06,824
No! No!

923
01:20:06,899 --> 01:20:09,697
I want them spittin' blood!

924
01:20:09,769 --> 01:20:13,068
- Easy, son, easy! Now ain't the time!
- Slow down, Ringo.

925
01:20:16,042 --> 01:20:19,705
I tell ya, boys, even I'm wary of what's
gonna happen once Ringo runs this outfit.

926
01:20:19,779 --> 01:20:22,475
God have mercy!

927
01:20:22,548 --> 01:20:26,507
Juanito, their time will come.
- Gentlemen.

928
01:20:26,585 --> 01:20:29,520
- You can pull it, boy!
- Let's go get sauced!

929
01:20:29,588 --> 01:20:31,783
- Barber.
- Yes, sir?

930
01:20:34,093 --> 01:20:36,027
Proceed, sir.

931
01:20:51,977 --> 01:20:56,380
Listen to me.
I need to speak with you.

932
01:20:56,449 --> 01:20:58,974
Not now. I'm busy.

933
01:20:59,051 --> 01:21:01,849
I see what's going on
between you and Wyatt.

934
01:21:01,921 --> 01:21:05,652
I'm not a fool.
And listen to me.

935
01:21:05,725 --> 01:21:10,424
Lots of so-called hard cases and
tough nuts come and go around this town,

936
01:21:10,496 --> 01:21:14,933
but none of them has a clue
about the real play... none of them.

937
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,595
Now after tonight, there'll be one man
in charge of Tombstone.

938
01:21:18,671 --> 01:21:22,767
You'll be happy to know him.
Bet on it.

939
01:21:30,983 --> 01:21:33,781
Gonna be one of those nights.

940
01:21:36,489 --> 01:21:39,720
It's getting' late, boys.
I'm gonna go to bed.

941
01:21:39,792 --> 01:21:42,727
- Good night, Virg.
- Good night, Morg.

942
01:21:42,795 --> 01:21:46,561
Bundle up, Virg.
It's getting' cold out there.

943
01:21:46,632 --> 01:21:48,497
Yeah.

944
01:22:15,294 --> 01:22:18,161
Tower of Babel.

945
01:22:18,230 --> 01:22:20,721
Death and the Devil.

946
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,547
Oh, dear.

947
01:22:21,548 --> 01:22:25,294
Oh, Allie. I wish you'd learn
to play a real card game.

948
01:22:29,909 --> 01:22:32,673
- More tea, Mattie?
- Mm-mmm. No, no.

949
01:22:32,745 --> 01:22:34,679
- Are you all right, Mattie?
- Yes.

950
01:22:34,747 --> 01:22:37,375
- Are you expecting someone?
- Only Virg.

951
01:22:42,655 --> 01:22:46,022
Please. I know it's awful
to come here, but listen.

952
01:22:46,091 --> 01:22:48,719
I think something's
gonna happen tonight.

953
01:22:50,830 --> 01:22:53,321
It's Virg.

954
01:22:53,399 --> 01:22:56,027
No! Get down!

955
01:23:13,986 --> 01:23:16,318
That thunder's
sure getting' close.

956
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:31,465
Virgil. What'd ya forget?

957
01:23:42,514 --> 01:23:44,982
Wyatt.

958
01:23:57,062 --> 01:24:00,156
Will you hurry
with that water, please?

959
01:24:00,232 --> 01:24:02,393
Come on, Lou.

960
01:24:04,937 --> 01:24:07,497
Wyatt! Wyatt!

961
01:24:09,742 --> 01:24:12,540
They hit Claude's house too,
shot up his wife.

962
01:24:12,611 --> 01:24:14,772
His wife!
Whoever heard of that?

963
01:24:14,847 --> 01:24:18,078
They're bugs, Wyatt. All that
smart talk about live and let live.

964
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:20,084
There ain't no live
and let live with bugs.

965
01:24:20,152 --> 01:24:22,484
All right, you listen to me now.
We gotta get out of here.

966
01:24:22,554 --> 01:24:25,614
Get out of here?
Listen to yourself, Wyatt.

967
01:24:25,691 --> 01:24:28,524
Lie down and crawl or you might
get hurt? What kind of talk is that?

968
01:24:28,594 --> 01:24:30,585
- Do you see what's happening here?
- What?

969
01:24:30,663 --> 01:24:33,928
What do you mean?
What are you saying?

970
01:24:33,999 --> 01:24:35,933
No. Please, no.

971
01:24:36,001 --> 01:24:39,300
I'm afraid your husband's
going to lose the use of his arm.

972
01:24:39,371 --> 01:24:41,931
Oh, God, no.

973
01:24:42,007 --> 01:24:45,067
Don't worry, Allie girl.

974
01:24:45,144 --> 01:24:48,477
I still got one good arm
to hold you with.

975
01:24:50,115 --> 01:24:52,242
Goddamn...

976
01:24:52,317 --> 01:24:56,879
- Goddamn sons-of-bitches!
- Morgan, wait a minute! Virg...

977
01:24:56,955 --> 01:24:59,321
- You had to be so damned smart.
- I'm sorry, Allie.

978
01:24:59,391 --> 01:25:01,655
I told you, Virg.

979
01:25:01,727 --> 01:25:04,025
- Not now, Wyatt.
- All right.

980
01:25:04,096 --> 01:25:06,257
All right, what do you want me to do?

981
01:25:06,331 --> 01:25:10,324
- Just leave me alone, for God's sakes.
- Virg...

982
01:25:10,402 --> 01:25:13,371
He doesn't want
to talk now, Wyatt!

983
01:25:29,454 --> 01:25:33,185
I heard about what they did
to your women. That was wrong.

984
01:25:33,258 --> 01:25:37,456
I'm here to let you know that it
wasn't me. I had no part of it.

985
01:25:37,529 --> 01:25:41,863
No? Brothers to the bone,
right, McMasters?

986
01:25:41,933 --> 01:25:46,165
No. Not anymore.
Not after this night.

987
01:25:46,238 --> 01:25:50,641
He's right, Wyatt. You want us
for anything, we're with you.

988
01:25:50,709 --> 01:25:52,677
Come on.

989
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:57,975
Hold him!

990
01:26:58,043 --> 01:27:01,979
No! Get her out of here! Jesus!

991
01:27:02,047 --> 01:27:06,279
Somebody shut that dog up!

992
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:11,614
I said hold him, goddammit!

993
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:14,318
- Somebody get that
goddamn dog out of here!

994
01:27:14,392 --> 01:27:17,850
The bullet's too deep.
I can't get it out.

995
01:27:20,098 --> 01:27:22,726
- The way it's lodged
in there... I'm sorry.

996
01:27:22,801 --> 01:27:25,895
Easy, Morg.
Is that better?

997
01:27:26,972 --> 01:27:28,906
Yeah.

998
01:27:31,476 --> 01:27:35,674
You were right, Wyatt.
They got me good.

999
01:27:37,516 --> 01:27:41,782
Don't let 'em get you, brother.
You're the one.

1000
01:27:42,854 --> 01:27:45,687
Easy, Morg.

1001
01:27:45,757 --> 01:27:48,817
Don't worry about that, now.

1002
01:27:52,697 --> 01:27:56,030
Remember what I said
about seein' a light when you're dying'?

1003
01:27:56,101 --> 01:27:59,559
Yeah. Yeah.

1004
01:27:59,638 --> 01:28:01,799
That ain't true.

1005
01:28:01,873 --> 01:28:04,808
I can't see a damn thing.

1006
01:28:07,846 --> 01:28:09,780
Morg?

1007
01:28:14,152 --> 01:28:16,086
Morg!

1008
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,694
Morg?

1009
01:28:37,742 --> 01:28:39,676
No.

1010
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:44,114
Morgan! No!

1011
01:28:44,182 --> 01:28:47,879
Morgan, don't die!
I love you!

1012
01:28:47,953 --> 01:28:50,012
Don't die!

1013
01:29:02,767 --> 01:29:05,861
Why? Why him?

1014
01:29:09,207 --> 01:29:13,473
- No. No, get away from me!
- Wyatt!

1015
01:29:14,646 --> 01:29:17,740
Can't you see?
Get away from me!

1016
01:29:52,751 --> 01:29:55,549
Morgan!

1017
01:30:46,638 --> 01:30:49,630
And so she walked
out of our lives forever.

1018
01:31:07,992 --> 01:31:09,926
Giddup!

1019
01:31:24,242 --> 01:31:27,734
Want you to know it's over.

1020
01:31:30,115 --> 01:31:32,208
Well.

1021
01:31:32,283 --> 01:31:34,251
Bye.

1022
01:31:36,254 --> 01:31:38,916
You smell that, Bill?

1023
01:31:40,525 --> 01:31:42,686
Smells like someone died.

1024
01:31:44,262 --> 01:31:47,959
Jesus, Johnny.

1025
01:31:57,942 --> 01:32:00,843
Giddyap!

1026
01:32:00,912 --> 01:32:03,847
Adios, cabrones.

1027
01:32:10,121 --> 01:32:12,055
Ike.

1028
01:32:13,191 --> 01:32:16,592
Take Stillwell and finish it.

1029
01:32:32,076 --> 01:32:35,534
Now, you take care of yourself...

1030
01:32:35,613 --> 01:32:39,276
- That's Virgil with the women.
- He's mine!

1031
01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:42,717
- All aboard!
- Hey, Mattie! Where's Wyatt?

1032
01:32:42,787 --> 01:32:45,415
Right behind you, Stillwell.

1033
01:32:45,490 --> 01:32:47,651
- Aah!
- No!

1034
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:04,474
Sweet Jesus.

1035
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:24,685
All right, Clanton.

1036
01:33:24,762 --> 01:33:28,892
You called down the thunder.
Well, now you got it.

1037
01:33:30,868 --> 01:33:34,804
You see that? It says,
'United States Marshal. '

1038
01:33:34,872 --> 01:33:37,397
Wyatt.
Please don't kill me. Please.

1039
01:33:37,475 --> 01:33:41,775
Take a good look at him, Ike,
'cause that's how you're gonna end up.

1040
01:33:43,914 --> 01:33:46,474
The Cowboys are finished.
You understand me?

1041
01:33:46,550 --> 01:33:50,077
I see a red sash,
I kill the man wearing' it.

1042
01:33:50,154 --> 01:33:52,179
So run, you cur.

1043
01:33:53,457 --> 01:33:58,121
Run! Tell all the other curs
the law is comin'!

1044
01:33:58,195 --> 01:34:00,527
You tell 'em I'm comin'!

1045
01:34:00,598 --> 01:34:03,533
And hell's comin'
with me, you hear?

1046
01:34:03,601 --> 01:34:06,399
Hell's comin' with me!

1047
01:34:39,537 --> 01:34:41,471
Nobody move!

1048
01:34:41,539 --> 01:34:44,997
Nonsense. By all means, move.

1049
01:35:58,916 --> 01:36:01,680
Get down!

1050
01:36:12,796 --> 01:36:15,924
Hey, Wyatt!

1051
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,161
How the hell are ya?

1052
01:36:24,608 --> 01:36:27,270
Ohh!

1053
01:36:30,514 --> 01:36:32,778
I got some boys
over there behind ya!

1054
01:36:32,850 --> 01:36:35,819
Got you in a little crossfire.
How do ya like that?

1055
01:36:38,689 --> 01:36:41,658
Come on! Think of
something fast, would ya?

1056
01:36:43,861 --> 01:36:48,127
Wyatt?
Hey, Wyatt.

1057
01:36:48,199 --> 01:36:50,167
- No.
- Wyatt!

1058
01:36:52,136 --> 01:36:54,263
- No.
- Wyatt, what are you doin'?

1059
01:36:54,338 --> 01:36:56,670
Look at that.

1060
01:36:56,740 --> 01:36:59,709
Yeah.

1061
01:36:59,777 --> 01:37:02,143
Come and get some, boy.

1062
01:37:07,084 --> 01:37:09,143
No! Let me!

1063
01:37:14,959 --> 01:37:18,122
No.

1064
01:37:18,195 --> 01:37:21,961
- Son-of-a-bitch.
- No!

1065
01:37:27,004 --> 01:37:28,972
Jesus Christ!

1066
01:37:33,244 --> 01:37:35,735
Yaahh!

1067
01:37:39,016 --> 01:37:41,678
No. No!

1068
01:37:53,530 --> 01:37:56,556
Did you ever see anything
like that before?

1069
01:37:56,634 --> 01:37:59,414
Hell, I ain't never even
heard of anything like that.

1070
01:37:59,415 --> 01:38:00,195
Nothing.

1071
01:38:01,272 --> 01:38:03,206
Where is he?

1072
01:38:03,274 --> 01:38:06,710
Down by the creek,

1073
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:09,108
walking' on water.

1074
01:38:09,179 --> 01:38:12,444
Well, let's hope he's got
another miracle up his sleeve.

1075
01:38:12,516 --> 01:38:16,509
'Cause if I know Ringo,
he's headed straight for us.

1076
01:38:16,587 --> 01:38:20,921
Well, if they were my brothers,
I'd want revenge too.

1077
01:38:20,991 --> 01:38:23,721
No. Make no mistake.

1078
01:38:23,794 --> 01:38:27,093
It's not revenge he's after.

1079
01:38:28,966 --> 01:38:31,196
It's a reckoning.

1080
01:38:41,412 --> 01:38:46,042
Doc. You ought to be in bed. What
the hell you doin' this for anyway?

1081
01:38:46,116 --> 01:38:48,607
Wyatt Earp is my friend.

1082
01:38:48,686 --> 01:38:51,849
Hell, I got lots of friends.

1083
01:38:53,857 --> 01:38:55,950
I don't.

1084
01:39:06,303 --> 01:39:09,466
Whoa! Whoa!

1085
01:39:14,511 --> 01:39:16,445
My God.

1086
01:39:19,583 --> 01:39:22,484
- Are you all right?
- What do you care?

1087
01:39:22,553 --> 01:39:24,919
It was your friends
that did it.

1088
01:39:27,124 --> 01:39:30,787
Must've been Claiborne and Fuller.
They left here last night.

1089
01:39:30,861 --> 01:39:33,659
Aw, no.

1090
01:39:33,731 --> 01:39:36,564
They tried to take my watch.

1091
01:39:36,633 --> 01:39:40,535
He cursed them for cowards,
and they shot him.

1092
01:39:41,605 --> 01:39:45,405
I don't understand
any of this.

1093
01:39:45,476 --> 01:39:47,944
I just know it's ugly.

1094
01:39:48,011 --> 01:39:50,605
You're all ugly,

1095
01:39:50,681 --> 01:39:54,276
and he was beautiful.

1096
01:39:54,351 --> 01:39:58,651
He tried to bring something fine into
your ugly world, and you shot him for it.

1097
01:40:02,860 --> 01:40:04,885
Not that you care.

1098
01:40:16,540 --> 01:40:19,737
- Billy. Where you going'?
- I'm not going' with you.

1099
01:40:19,810 --> 01:40:22,108
Billy!
Billy, get back here!

1100
01:40:22,179 --> 01:40:24,739
I'm sorry, sir,
but we got to have some law.

1101
01:40:24,815 --> 01:40:28,649
- Billy!
- Let him go. Who cares?

1102
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:32,052
Yaahh! Get the hell
outta here! Go on!

1103
01:40:32,122 --> 01:40:34,955
Party's over, boys.
Let's go!

1104
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:51,774
Whoa.

1105
01:40:57,279 --> 01:41:00,442
Ringo and Behan
are out front.

1106
01:41:00,516 --> 01:41:04,543
There is about 30 of 'em.

1107
01:41:05,687 --> 01:41:07,621
They're all wearing' badges.

1108
01:41:09,558 --> 01:41:11,753
Christ.

1109
01:41:11,827 --> 01:41:15,957
We gotta find
a place to hole up.

1110
01:41:16,031 --> 01:41:18,158
Doc.

1111
01:41:18,233 --> 01:41:20,167
Grab him.

1112
01:41:22,437 --> 01:41:24,371
I got him.

1113
01:41:25,007 --> 01:41:26,941
I got him!

1114
01:41:32,548 --> 01:41:34,482
Is this Henry Hooker's ranch?

1115
01:41:34,550 --> 01:41:37,212
That's right.
And I'm Hooker.

1116
01:41:37,286 --> 01:41:39,584
We got a sick man.

1117
01:41:39,655 --> 01:41:41,646
And our horses are done in.

1118
01:41:41,723 --> 01:41:44,089
Put him up at my place,

1119
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:46,286
as long as it's just tonight.

1120
01:41:46,361 --> 01:41:48,329
We're in debt to ya.

1121
01:41:55,604 --> 01:42:01,099
I know you boys have got to keep moving',
but he looks pretty bad to me.

1122
01:42:04,446 --> 01:42:08,405
- Whoa!
- I, uh...

1123
01:42:28,971 --> 01:42:32,236
They got held up,
and their boss actor got killed.

1124
01:42:32,307 --> 01:42:35,606
They came here to water the horses,
then they'll push on.

1125
01:42:52,894 --> 01:42:56,830
I'm sorry about your friend.
And I'm... I'm sorry that I...

1126
01:42:56,898 --> 01:43:00,129
I forgave you
the moment you said it.

1127
01:43:00,202 --> 01:43:02,932
You did? Well...

1128
01:43:04,172 --> 01:43:06,106
Thank you.

1129
01:43:07,442 --> 01:43:09,501
All set.

1130
01:43:11,546 --> 01:43:13,844
I have to go.

1131
01:43:16,485 --> 01:43:18,453
Wait.

1132
01:43:38,173 --> 01:43:40,141
Hyah!

1133
01:43:40,208 --> 01:43:42,403
Giddup!

1134
01:44:04,433 --> 01:44:06,867
What the hell is that?

1135
01:44:26,621 --> 01:44:29,556
They got McMasters!

1136
01:44:29,624 --> 01:44:31,956
Geez!

1137
01:44:32,027 --> 01:44:34,621
Ringo wanted to make sure
he got your attention, Marshal!

1138
01:44:34,696 --> 01:44:37,688
He wants a straight-up fight,
just you and him,

1139
01:44:37,766 --> 01:44:40,030
to settle this thing
once and for all.

1140
01:44:40,102 --> 01:44:43,731
Oak grove at the mouth
of Silver Springs canyon, 7:00!

1141
01:44:43,805 --> 01:44:46,740
You tell him I'll be there!

1142
01:44:46,808 --> 01:44:50,403
- Are you crazy?
- I'll be there!

1143
01:44:50,479 --> 01:44:52,970
It's not finished.

1144
01:45:07,929 --> 01:45:11,023
After I'm done
with Wyatt Earp,

1145
01:45:11,099 --> 01:45:16,036
take your Cowboys and finish off
Creek Johnson and Texas Jack.

1146
01:45:17,472 --> 01:45:19,463
You burn 'em, Ike.

1147
01:45:21,643 --> 01:45:26,307
- Burn 'em all.
- Hell, Johnny, he ain't even gonna show.

1148
01:45:26,381 --> 01:45:28,508
Giddap!

1149
01:45:28,583 --> 01:45:31,245
He'll show.

1150
01:45:33,822 --> 01:45:38,088
I spent my whole life not knowin'
what I wanted outta life,

1151
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:40,651
just chasin' my tail.

1152
01:45:40,729 --> 01:45:44,426
Now for the first time
I know exactly what I want,

1153
01:45:44,499 --> 01:45:46,899
and who.

1154
01:45:48,003 --> 01:45:50,870
And that's
the damnable misery of it.

1155
01:45:55,811 --> 01:45:58,473
What makes a man
like Ringo, Doc?

1156
01:45:58,547 --> 01:46:01,539
What makes him
do the things he does?

1157
01:46:01,616 --> 01:46:04,380
A man like Ringo...

1158
01:46:04,453 --> 01:46:08,685
got a great empty hole
right through the middle of him.

1159
01:46:10,125 --> 01:46:14,926
He can never kill enough
or steal enough...

1160
01:46:14,996 --> 01:46:17,863
or inflict enough pain
to ever fill it.

1161
01:46:17,933 --> 01:46:20,367
What does he need?

1162
01:46:21,570 --> 01:46:23,504
Revenge.

1163
01:46:26,808 --> 01:46:29,402
For what?

1164
01:46:34,182 --> 01:46:36,116
Bein' born.

1165
01:46:49,965 --> 01:46:51,990
It all happened so fast
with Curly Bill...

1166
01:46:52,067 --> 01:46:54,160
I didn't really have time
to think about it,

1167
01:46:54,236 --> 01:46:56,727
but I've had plenty of time
to think about this.

1168
01:47:03,945 --> 01:47:06,413
I can't beat him, can I?

1169
01:47:08,383 --> 01:47:10,544
No.

1170
01:47:16,591 --> 01:47:20,527
Wait.
I'm going' with ya.

1171
01:47:26,034 --> 01:47:30,061
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

1172
01:47:30,138 --> 01:47:32,333
I'm sorry, Wyatt.

1173
01:47:32,407 --> 01:47:34,932
It's all right, Doc.

1174
01:47:38,079 --> 01:47:41,014
What's it like to wear
one of those?

1175
01:48:08,476 --> 01:48:10,410
Don't worry.

1176
01:48:10,478 --> 01:48:13,675
They want him,
they gotta come over us first.

1177
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:44,802
He's waiting' for you by the big oak,
quarter mile up that trail.

1178
01:48:50,352 --> 01:48:53,651
They're not giving' ya
any safe conduct.

1179
01:48:53,722 --> 01:48:57,988
Shooting' starts, you better kick east
to the New Mexico line.

1180
01:49:00,495 --> 01:49:02,759
I ain't got the words.

1181
01:49:02,831 --> 01:49:05,425
I know.

1182
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:07,832
Me neither.

1183
01:49:15,410 --> 01:49:17,344
Well.

1184
01:49:23,418 --> 01:49:26,622
I didn't think
ya had it in you.

1185
01:49:26,755 --> 01:49:29,656
I'm your huckleberry.

1186
01:49:32,260 --> 01:49:35,161
Why, Johnny Ringo,

1187
01:49:35,230 --> 01:49:39,291
you look like somebody
just walked over your grave.

1188
01:49:40,369 --> 01:49:43,304
Fight's not with you, Holliday.

1189
01:49:43,372 --> 01:49:48,071
I'll beg to differ, sir. We started
a game we never got to finish.

1190
01:49:49,144 --> 01:49:51,510
Play for blood, remember?

1191
01:49:52,748 --> 01:49:55,979
I was just fooling' about.

1192
01:49:57,586 --> 01:49:59,520
I wasn't.

1193
01:50:00,922 --> 01:50:03,117
And this time...

1194
01:50:04,326 --> 01:50:06,920
it's legal.

1195
01:50:14,169 --> 01:50:18,071
All right, lunger.
Let's do it.

1196
01:50:51,506 --> 01:50:53,440
Say when.

1197
01:51:11,793 --> 01:51:15,786
Come on. Come on!

1198
01:51:15,864 --> 01:51:19,027
Oh, Johnny. Come on!

1199
01:51:23,872 --> 01:51:27,399
You're no daisy.
You're no daisy at all!

1200
01:51:28,543 --> 01:51:30,943
Poor soul.

1201
01:51:31,012 --> 01:51:33,913
You were just
too high-strung.

1202
01:51:43,859 --> 01:51:48,887
I'm afraid the strain
was more than he could bear.

1203
01:51:55,737 --> 01:52:00,265
Oh, I wasn't quite
as sick as I made out.

1204
01:52:02,711 --> 01:52:05,271
Good God.

1205
01:52:11,753 --> 01:52:14,654
My hypocrisy
goes only so far.

1206
01:52:19,661 --> 01:52:21,629
All right.

1207
01:52:21,696 --> 01:52:24,187
Let's finish it.

1208
01:52:24,266 --> 01:52:29,602
Indeed, sir. The last charge
of Wyatt Earp and his immortals.

1209
01:53:21,323 --> 01:53:24,258
Hyah! Hyah, come on!

1210
01:53:25,861 --> 01:53:28,796
No! Here!

1211
01:53:28,864 --> 01:53:30,798
Look at this!

1212
01:54:51,279 --> 01:54:53,213
Hello, Wyatt.

1213
01:54:53,281 --> 01:54:56,773
Father Feeney
and I were just...

1214
01:54:56,851 --> 01:55:02,221
investigating the mysteries
of the church of Rome.

1215
01:55:03,324 --> 01:55:08,728
It appears my hypocrisy
knows no bounds.

1216
01:55:08,796 --> 01:55:12,892
You're no hypocrite, Doc.
You just like to sound like one.

1217
01:55:12,967 --> 01:55:15,595
I brought you something'.

1218
01:55:21,209 --> 01:55:24,906
Well, let's see.
Where are we today?

1219
01:55:24,979 --> 01:55:28,540
I'm $17 down to you.

1220
01:55:28,616 --> 01:55:32,279
- Two bits a hand. Stud?
- You keep comin' back here.

1221
01:55:32,353 --> 01:55:35,117
I told you not to,
and I meant it.

1222
01:55:35,190 --> 01:55:38,751
You're the only person
I can afford to lose to anymore.

1223
01:55:41,529 --> 01:55:45,021
How we feeling' today, Doc?

1224
01:55:45,099 --> 01:55:47,863
I'm dying. How are you?

1225
01:55:47,936 --> 01:55:50,496
Pretty much the same.

1226
01:55:50,572 --> 01:55:55,134
- So now we add self-pity to our
list of frailties. - All right, Doc.

1227
01:55:55,210 --> 01:55:58,543
All right, how many
cards you want?

1228
01:55:58,613 --> 01:56:01,912
I don't want
to play anymore.

1229
01:56:01,983 --> 01:56:04,713
How many?

1230
01:56:04,786 --> 01:56:09,814
Damn you.
You're the most fallible,

1231
01:56:09,891 --> 01:56:12,826
stubborn, self-deluded,

1232
01:56:12,894 --> 01:56:15,491
bullheaded man I've ever
known in my entire life.

1233
01:56:15,492 --> 01:56:16,489
I call.

1234
01:56:17,565 --> 01:56:19,795
- You win.
- Yet with all,

1235
01:56:19,867 --> 01:56:24,429
you're the only human being
in my entire life who ever gave me hope.

1236
01:56:31,079 --> 01:56:34,515
I was in love once.

1237
01:56:35,583 --> 01:56:37,608
My first cousin.

1238
01:56:37,685 --> 01:56:41,143
She was 15.

1239
01:56:43,524 --> 01:56:45,822
We were both so...

1240
01:56:46,894 --> 01:56:49,294
That's good, Doc.

1241
01:56:49,364 --> 01:56:52,060
That's... That's good.
What happened?

1242
01:56:55,203 --> 01:56:58,866
She joined a convent
over the affair.

1243
01:56:58,940 --> 01:57:01,875
She was all I ever wanted.

1244
01:57:03,578 --> 01:57:06,046
What did you want?

1245
01:57:06,114 --> 01:57:09,379
Just to live a normal life.

1246
01:57:09,450 --> 01:57:14,251
There's no normal life, Wyatt.
There's just life.

1247
01:57:14,322 --> 01:57:17,223
Now get on with it.

1248
01:57:17,292 --> 01:57:19,385
Don't know how.

1249
01:57:21,296 --> 01:57:25,062
Sure you do.
Say good-bye to me.

1250
01:57:26,301 --> 01:57:28,963
Go grab
that spirited actress...

1251
01:57:29,037 --> 01:57:32,336
and make her your own.

1252
01:57:32,407 --> 01:57:35,570
Take that beauty and run,
and don't look back.

1253
01:57:35,643 --> 01:57:39,943
Live every second.
Live right up to the hilt.

1254
01:57:40,014 --> 01:57:41,982
Live, Wyatt.

1255
01:57:43,117 --> 01:57:45,176
Live for me.

1256
01:57:46,521 --> 01:57:49,251
Wyatt? If you
ever were my friend,

1257
01:57:49,324 --> 01:57:52,589
if you ever had even
the slightest feeling' for me,

1258
01:57:52,660 --> 01:57:55,151
leave now.

1259
01:57:55,229 --> 01:57:57,220
Leave now.

1260
01:58:01,569 --> 01:58:04,367
Please?

1261
01:58:14,982 --> 01:58:17,712
Thanks for always
being' there, Doc.

1262
01:58:45,680 --> 01:58:47,705
I'll be damned.

1263
01:58:50,385 --> 01:58:53,320
This is funny.

1264
01:59:12,874 --> 01:59:18,312
I never thought I would see Gilbert and
Sullivan performed right here in Denver.

1265
01:59:18,379 --> 01:59:21,576
- Good night, Josie.
- Good night.

1266
01:59:21,649 --> 01:59:23,583
Good show.

1267
01:59:40,001 --> 01:59:43,562
Ya ever see the sun come up
over the Rockies?

1268
01:59:43,638 --> 01:59:48,041
It hits all of a sudden,
and below there's California.

1269
01:59:48,109 --> 01:59:51,203
And you swear
you're looking' at heaven.

1270
01:59:59,053 --> 02:00:01,783
I have nothing left,

1271
02:00:01,856 --> 02:00:04,518
nothing to give you.

1272
02:00:04,592 --> 02:00:09,188
I have no pride,
no dignity.

1273
02:00:09,263 --> 02:00:13,996
No money. I don't even know
how we'll make a living, but...

1274
02:00:17,872 --> 02:00:20,898
I promise I'll love you
the rest of your life.

1275
02:00:36,290 --> 02:00:40,886
Don't worry, Wyatt.
My family's rich.

1276
02:00:47,401 --> 02:00:50,029
What shall we do first?

1277
02:00:50,104 --> 02:00:52,902
What you wanted to do
the first night we met.

1278
02:00:52,974 --> 02:00:55,841
- Remember?
- Uh-uh.

1279
02:00:57,378 --> 02:01:00,745
May I have this dance?

1280
02:01:00,815 --> 02:01:02,908
Yes.

1281
02:01:02,984 --> 02:01:05,919
And then we'll
have room service.

1282
02:01:12,627 --> 02:01:16,290
The power of the Cowboy Gang
was broken forever.

1283
02:01:16,364 --> 02:01:21,131
Ike Clanton was shot and killed two
years later during an attempted robbery.

1284
02:01:21,202 --> 02:01:26,037
Mattie died of a drug overdose
shortly after she left Tombstone.

1285
02:01:26,107 --> 02:01:29,338
Virgil and Allie Earp
moved to California, where Virgil,

1286
02:01:29,410 --> 02:01:33,039
despite the use of only one arm,
became a town sheriff.

1287
02:01:33,114 --> 02:01:37,073
Wyatt and Josephine
embarked on a series of adventures.

1288
02:01:37,151 --> 02:01:42,453
Up or down, thin or flush, in 47 years
they never left each other's side.

1289
02:01:42,523 --> 02:01:45,959
Wyatt Earp died
in Los Angeles in 1929.

1290
02:01:46,027 --> 02:01:48,870
Among the pallbearers
at his funeral...

1291
02:01:48,946 --> 02:01:53,076
were early Western movie stars
William S. Hart and Tom Mix.

1292
02:01:53,150 --> 02:01:56,119
Tom Mix wept.
