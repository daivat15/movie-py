1
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:30,205
His name is Jan.

2
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:35,211
I do not know him.

3
00:00:38,715 --> 00:00:41,218
He's from the rig.

4
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:45,306
You know we do not favour
matrimony with outsiders.

5
00:00:45,807 --> 00:00:48,310
Can you even tell us what matrimony is?

6
00:00:50,813 --> 00:00:55,819
It's when two people are joined in God.

7
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:58,571
Do you really believe you're capable...

8
00:00:58,572 --> 00:01:00,074
...of bearing the responsibility

9
00:01:00,116 --> 00:01:02,576
...not only for your own marriage in God,

10
00:01:02,577 --> 00:01:06,081
...but also another's?

11
00:01:06,582 --> 00:01:08,584
I know I am.

12
00:01:11,003 --> 00:01:16,009
Can you think of anything of real value...

13
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,514
...that the outsiders have
brought with them?

14
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,022
Their music.

15
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:36,283
Out you go, Bess McNeill, and be seated.

16
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:54,304
<i>Forgot my six-string razor,</i>

17
00:01:54,305 --> 00:01:57,808
<i>...hit the sky</i>

18
00:01:57,809 --> 00:01:59,810
<i>Halfway to Memphis...</i>

19
00:01:59,811 --> 00:02:02,815
<i>...before I realized</i>

20
00:02:04,317 --> 00:02:07,821
<i>Well, I rang the information...</i>

21
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:09,823
<i>...my axe was cold</i>

22
00:02:11,826 --> 00:02:16,831
<i>They said she rides a train to Oriole</i>

23
00:02:17,332 --> 00:02:19,834
<i>Now it's a mighty long way...</i>

24
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:21,836
Bess.

25
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:23,338
Bess, come on.
Don't be silly.

26
00:02:23,339 --> 00:02:24,840
He's late.

27
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:26,342
All right, but at least he's coming.

28
00:02:26,343 --> 00:02:27,344
Get this on, then.

29
00:02:27,845 --> 00:02:29,125
You're going to ruin your dress.

30
00:02:29,346 --> 00:02:31,348
He's late.

31
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:33,350
You're being silly.
Come on.

32
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:34,852
Come on.

33
00:02:34,853 --> 00:02:36,354
Bess, get your clothes on.

34
00:02:36,355 --> 00:02:37,855
Come on.
Don't ruin it.

35
00:02:37,856 --> 00:02:38,858
It's a good day.
Come on.

36
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,698
Bess, you're not supposed to see him.
You know that.

37
00:02:47,952 --> 00:02:49,073
You're going to ruin your...

38
00:02:57,463 --> 00:02:58,965
You're late!

39
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:28,917
Hey!

40
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:36,759
Break out the bottles!

41
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:56,950
Come on.
It's my wedding.

42
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,963
Will you please,
be upstanding for the bride?

43
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:17,224
<i>The Lord's my Shepherd,</i>

44
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:20,728
<i>I'll not want;</i>

45
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:28,738
<i>He makes me come to God...</i>

46
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:33,243
<i>...in pastures green;</i>

47
00:04:33,785 --> 00:04:37,748
<i>He leadeth me...</i>

48
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:44,423
<i>...as quiet waters lie...</i>

49
00:04:45,925 --> 00:04:49,930
As we stand in thy presence
today, in thy house,

50
00:04:50,013 --> 00:04:54,017
We worship thee as the author...

51
00:04:54,018 --> 00:04:58,439
...of every good and perfect gift.

52
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,446
Christ loved the church
and gave himself for her.

53
00:05:03,946 --> 00:05:08,451
We should love Christ
and give ourselves to him.

54
00:05:10,454 --> 00:05:13,456
If it is not too inappropriate...

55
00:05:13,457 --> 00:05:15,960
...may I say that you, Bess,

56
00:05:16,461 --> 00:05:20,465
...have shown that love and that
commitment in your own life.

57
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:22,467
It is not once or twice...

58
00:05:22,468 --> 00:05:24,469
...that you have been in this building,

59
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,974
...giving your time
and effort to cleaning it.

60
00:05:27,975 --> 00:05:30,477
I know that you have done that...

61
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,481
...not so as to be
well-thought-of here on earth

62
00:05:34,482 --> 00:05:37,986
...but out of your love for God in heaven.

63
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:50,001
Great sermon, father.

64
00:06:00,513 --> 00:06:03,516
Ring the bells, then.

65
00:06:03,517 --> 00:06:06,520
Our church has no bells.

66
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,282
That's not too fun, is it?

67
00:06:35,137 --> 00:06:36,639
This is Dodo.

68
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:38,140
The sister-in-law.

69
00:06:38,141 --> 00:06:40,143
We haven't really met, have we?

70
00:06:40,561 --> 00:06:43,564
No.
Well, everything happened so quickly.

71
00:06:43,898 --> 00:06:46,401
What makes you say that?

72
00:06:46,443 --> 00:06:50,406
I just mean...
Well, it did, didn't it?

73
00:06:50,823 --> 00:06:54,826
Are you not happy for me?

74
00:06:54,827 --> 00:06:57,831
Of course I am.

75
00:06:58,332 --> 00:06:59,833
Of course I am.

76
00:07:03,713 --> 00:07:05,172
Come on, Terry.

77
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,604
Hey!

78
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:23,194
Get along, little doggies!

79
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:32,873
Bess.

80
00:09:30,512 --> 00:09:33,514
"Dear Bess,

81
00:09:33,515 --> 00:09:36,017
"I've known you for 6 years,

82
00:09:36,018 --> 00:09:37,519
...and I can definitely say...

83
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,021
...you have the biggest heart...

84
00:09:39,022 --> 00:09:41,024
...of anyone I've ever met."

85
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:48,282
"It wasn't easy for me here
when I married Sam,

86
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:50,284
...but you welcomed me instantly,

87
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:52,288
...and I won't ever forget that."

88
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,293
"Your generosity knows no bounds,

89
00:09:57,294 --> 00:09:59,796
...like the time when you
lent jack a bike...

90
00:09:59,797 --> 00:10:01,798
...because his was broken,
only it was mine,

91
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,801
...and I had to walk to work."

92
00:10:08,807 --> 00:10:11,810
"I was furious with you then,

93
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:12,812
...but I regret that now,

94
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,315
...because it's your spirit."

95
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:19,820
"You'd give anything to anyone."

96
00:10:26,328 --> 00:10:30,833
"When Sam died, I lost
a husband, and you a brother."

97
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,842
"We saw each other through that...

98
00:10:38,843 --> 00:10:41,346
...and promised to look after one another."

99
00:10:42,848 --> 00:10:45,850
"You are the reason..." sorry.

100
00:10:45,851 --> 00:10:48,353
"I have stayed...

101
00:10:48,354 --> 00:10:51,857
...when I almost gave up
in this cold place,

102
00:10:51,858 --> 00:10:57,365
...and now your warmth
has embraced another outsider."

103
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,868
"His name is Jan,

104
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:04,372
...and I don't know
much about him,

105
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:09,378
...but I'll accept
his right to be here...

106
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:10,881
...because of you, Bess."

107
00:11:14,886 --> 00:11:16,887
"If he doesn't take care of you...

108
00:11:16,888 --> 00:11:18,889
...and give you
everything you need,

109
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,392
...I'll kill him."

110
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:28,401
"Thank you for all you've given me, Bess.

111
00:11:28,402 --> 00:11:30,905
I love you very much."

112
00:12:11,703 --> 00:12:13,705
Have me now?

113
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,710
Here?

114
00:12:29,724 --> 00:12:34,229
Maybe you wanted something more romantic.

115
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,733
This is lovely.

116
00:12:47,746 --> 00:12:49,247
You sure?

117
00:12:53,753 --> 00:12:55,755
No.
Have me.

118
00:12:57,257 --> 00:12:59,259
What do I do?

119
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,968
Ok?

120
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,473
You got blood on your dress.

121
00:15:05,492 --> 00:15:08,496
Shall I go down and wait for you?

122
00:15:17,006 --> 00:15:19,008
You ok?

123
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:32,024
Hi.

124
00:16:37,017 --> 00:16:38,519
Take care of yourself.

125
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,022
Go get her now, Jan!

126
00:16:58,543 --> 00:17:00,545
Go get her, Jan!

127
00:17:08,054 --> 00:17:11,140
<i>Every day I spend my time</i>

128
00:17:11,141 --> 00:17:14,143
<i>Drinking wine, feeling fine</i>

129
00:17:14,144 --> 00:17:17,648
<i>Waiting here to find the sign</i>

130
00:17:17,649 --> 00:17:21,152
<i>That I can understand</i>

131
00:17:21,153 --> 00:17:23,155
<i>yes, I am</i>

132
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:26,158
<i>In the days between the hours</i>

133
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:27,661
<i>Ivory towers,</i>

134
00:17:28,161 --> 00:17:29,162
<i>...bloody flowers</i>

135
00:17:29,663 --> 00:17:32,665
<i>Push their heads into the air</i>

136
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:36,170
<i>I don't care if I ever know</i>

137
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:38,674
<i>there I go</i>

138
00:17:41,677 --> 00:17:46,181
<i>Don't push your love too far</i>

139
00:17:46,182 --> 00:17:49,185
Can't get this fucker open.

140
00:17:49,186 --> 00:17:50,688
Shit.

141
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,713
What's so funny?

142
00:19:27,573 --> 00:19:30,075
How could you take it?

143
00:19:30,076 --> 00:19:33,080
How could you keep away from the boys?

144
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,586
I waited for you.

145
00:19:40,088 --> 00:19:42,091
No.
Don't laugh.

146
00:19:43,592 --> 00:19:45,094
Yeah.

147
00:19:48,098 --> 00:19:51,100
But you must have been lonely.

148
00:19:51,101 --> 00:19:53,104
Who did you talk to?

149
00:19:56,107 --> 00:20:00,111
I thank you for the greatest gift of all:

150
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:01,614
the gift of love.

151
00:20:03,115 --> 00:20:05,118
I thank you for Jan.

152
00:20:07,621 --> 00:20:11,125
I'm so lucky to have been
given these gifts.

153
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,634
But remember to be a good girl, Bess,

154
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:23,139
...for you know I giveth
and I taketh away.

155
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:28,646
What?
I didn't mean it like that.

156
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:34,152
Yes. I'll be good.
I'll be really, really good.

157
00:21:10,445 --> 00:21:12,448
Thank you.

158
00:21:13,949 --> 00:21:15,451
What did you say?

159
00:21:16,953 --> 00:21:18,955
Thank you.

160
00:21:59,754 --> 00:22:01,255
Fly.

161
00:22:03,341 --> 00:22:05,344
Away!

162
00:22:42,721 --> 00:22:44,222
Hello, Jan.

163
00:22:44,223 --> 00:22:45,223
Hello.

164
00:22:45,224 --> 00:22:46,224
Bess.

165
00:22:46,225 --> 00:22:47,227
Hello.

166
00:22:50,731 --> 00:22:53,400
Why don't you have any church bells?

167
00:22:53,401 --> 00:22:57,405
We do not need bells in
our church to worship God.

168
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,412
I like church bells.

169
00:23:05,415 --> 00:23:07,918
Let's put them back again.

170
00:23:14,008 --> 00:23:15,510
Have fun.

171
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:22,267
But now, friends,

172
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:26,273
...things have become very different.

173
00:23:28,275 --> 00:23:31,778
It hurts me to have to say it,

174
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:35,784
...but there appears to be
those in the church...

175
00:23:36,285 --> 00:23:42,291
...who are prepared to
cling to the world...

176
00:23:42,292 --> 00:23:45,295
...instead of fleeing from it.

177
00:23:45,796 --> 00:23:47,797
But those to whom I refer...

178
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:52,303
...will know what I am speaking about.

179
00:23:52,304 --> 00:23:54,807
It grieves my heart,

180
00:23:55,307 --> 00:23:57,809
...and I know there are others...

181
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:00,312
...who feel just the same.

182
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,815
Amen.

183
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:10,826
Mr. Donald John Beaton,
will you rise and address the question?

184
00:24:18,335 --> 00:24:21,839
Thank you, Lord, for this day
you have blessed us with.

185
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:32,601
It's stupid that only men
can talk in the service.

186
00:24:33,102 --> 00:24:35,605
Hold your tongue, woman.

187
00:24:41,362 --> 00:24:43,865
<i>Lassie!
It's Lassie!</i>

188
00:24:54,377 --> 00:24:58,381
<i>It is Lassie, I know it!</i>

189
00:24:58,382 --> 00:25:01,886
<i>Lassie!
Oh, Lassie!</i>

190
00:25:04,389 --> 00:25:09,395
<i>Lassie. Oh, Lassie.
Welcome home.</i>

191
00:25:22,327 --> 00:25:25,331
They're burying Anthony now.

192
00:25:29,335 --> 00:25:31,837
Go and listen to the minister.

193
00:25:31,838 --> 00:25:33,339
What?

194
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,842
Yeah.
You can do that if you want.

195
00:25:35,843 --> 00:25:37,845
Men are allowed at funerals.

196
00:25:39,848 --> 00:25:41,850
Go on.

197
00:25:57,202 --> 00:26:00,706
Anthony Dodd Mantle, who has been one...

198
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:05,711
Anthony Dodd Mantle, you are a sinner...

199
00:26:05,712 --> 00:26:08,715
...and you deserve your place in hell.

200
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:24,149
The minister said he would go to hell.

201
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,153
Did he say that?

202
00:26:26,403 --> 00:26:28,405
Bloody cheerful.

203
00:26:30,908 --> 00:26:32,910
Will Anthony go to hell.

204
00:26:32,911 --> 00:26:34,412
Everyone knows that.

205
00:26:41,921 --> 00:26:42,922
You do realize...

206
00:26:43,423 --> 00:26:45,425
...that I will have to go back soon,
don't you?

207
00:27:08,953 --> 00:27:11,957
You knew it all the time.

208
00:27:16,879 --> 00:27:20,549
"Lord, we are unworthy of
the least of all thy mercies.

209
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:23,052
We thank thee for this food.

210
00:27:23,053 --> 00:27:26,057
Pardon our sins for Jesus' sake.
Amen."

211
00:27:26,557 --> 00:27:27,559
Amen.

212
00:27:44,078 --> 00:27:46,080
When are you going back?

213
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,581
Didn't you know?

214
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,585
Jan's going to stay at home with me...

215
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:54,089
...quit the rig because we're so happy.

216
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,593
Bess, come on.

217
00:28:10,109 --> 00:28:12,612
I wish I could.

218
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:25,293
I will not have that kind of
behaviour in my house!

219
00:28:25,294 --> 00:28:27,796
I'm sorry, mother.
I'm sorry.

220
00:28:27,797 --> 00:28:29,799
If you cannot control your moods,

221
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,020
...It's the hospital again
for you, my girl.

222
00:28:32,062 --> 00:28:33,302
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

223
00:28:33,303 --> 00:28:35,305
Why should you be any different?

224
00:28:35,306 --> 00:28:38,308
Every woman around here
has to learn to be alone...

225
00:28:38,309 --> 00:28:40,812
...when their man's away
at sea or on the oil rigs.

226
00:28:41,146 --> 00:28:45,651
Even you can learn how to endure.

227
00:29:00,335 --> 00:29:02,838
I don't even know who you are.

228
00:29:04,841 --> 00:29:07,844
I don't know anything about you,

229
00:29:08,345 --> 00:29:09,847
...and quite frankly...

230
00:29:10,347 --> 00:29:11,848
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to say this,

231
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:13,351
...but I don't trust you.

232
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,862
She's...
She's very susceptible.

233
00:29:26,867 --> 00:29:28,368
And you could get her...

234
00:29:31,873 --> 00:29:33,874
You could get her to do
anything you wanted.

235
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:37,379
No.
I don't think so.

236
00:29:38,881 --> 00:29:42,886
How am I supposed to look out for her now?

237
00:29:44,888 --> 00:29:46,889
What do you want to do?

238
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,393
Keep her here, locked up
for the rest of her life?

239
00:29:49,894 --> 00:29:51,395
She hasn't got the strength.

240
00:29:51,396 --> 00:29:52,897
She's stronger than you and me.

241
00:29:52,898 --> 00:29:54,899
You don't understand, do you?

242
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,401
She's not right in the head.

243
00:29:56,402 --> 00:29:59,405
Come on.
She just wants it all.

244
00:30:19,262 --> 00:30:21,263
What's this?

245
00:30:21,264 --> 00:30:22,266
What?

246
00:30:24,268 --> 00:30:25,770
What?

247
00:30:27,272 --> 00:30:29,273
What's that?

248
00:30:29,274 --> 00:30:30,776
What's that?

249
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,781
It's a present.

250
00:30:35,782 --> 00:30:37,616
Can I open it?

251
00:30:37,617 --> 00:30:39,119
Yeah, sure.
Open it.

252
00:30:55,889 --> 00:30:57,890
Nice colours, aren't they?

253
00:30:57,891 --> 00:30:59,393
Very cheerful.

254
00:31:08,153 --> 00:31:10,155
It's open.

255
00:31:10,156 --> 00:31:12,157
We've been waiting for you, bud.

256
00:31:12,158 --> 00:31:13,660
Hey.

257
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:30,930
Yeah. That's fine.
You want a little snort?

258
00:31:42,444 --> 00:31:44,446
Look at you.

259
00:32:47,688 --> 00:32:49,190
Bess!

260
00:33:06,043 --> 00:33:08,044
No!

261
00:33:10,298 --> 00:33:12,300
No!

262
00:33:22,312 --> 00:33:24,315
Come, come, come.

263
00:33:41,835 --> 00:33:43,337
All right?

264
00:33:44,338 --> 00:33:46,840
It's ok.

265
00:33:46,841 --> 00:33:48,343
It's ok.

266
00:34:09,034 --> 00:34:11,536
Watch your head!

267
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:16,542
Watch your head.

268
00:34:16,543 --> 00:34:19,046
Ok?

269
00:34:23,552 --> 00:34:25,554
It's just for a little.

270
00:34:41,072 --> 00:34:43,075
I'll call you.

271
00:34:46,078 --> 00:34:48,581
Jan!

272
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:26,458
No!

273
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:27,461
Bess!

274
00:35:29,463 --> 00:35:30,965
No!

275
00:35:33,968 --> 00:35:35,470
Bess!

276
00:35:56,996 --> 00:36:00,999
You're going to be all right, dear.

277
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,003
Ok?
You're ok.

278
00:36:19,522 --> 00:36:21,024
It's all right, darling.

279
00:36:27,949 --> 00:36:29,951
It's all right.

280
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:50,475
It's all right.

281
00:36:50,476 --> 00:36:51,976
It's ok.

282
00:36:51,977 --> 00:36:53,478
It's all right, dear.

283
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:55,480
Let's give you one of these.

284
00:36:55,481 --> 00:36:59,987
One of these down you.

285
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,491
Here we go.
Take one of these.

286
00:37:04,492 --> 00:37:06,494
That's it.
Pop it in your mouth.

287
00:37:06,495 --> 00:37:08,497
Swallow.

288
00:37:10,332 --> 00:37:16,005
<i>Who would be a poor man,
a beggar man, a thief?</i>

289
00:37:16,006 --> 00:37:21,511
<i>If he had a rich man
in his hand?</i>

290
00:37:21,512 --> 00:37:26,518
<i>And who would steal the candy
from a laughing baby's mouth?</i>

291
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:32,524
<i>If he could take it
from the money man?</i>

292
00:37:32,525 --> 00:37:37,531
<i>Cross eyed Mary
a-goes jumping in again</i>

293
00:37:38,032 --> 00:37:40,033
<i>She signs no contract</i>

294
00:37:40,034 --> 00:37:42,537
<i>but she always
plays the game</i>

295
00:37:43,038 --> 00:37:46,542
<i>She dines in Hampstead village...</i>

296
00:37:50,046 --> 00:37:55,051
You are guilty of selfishness, Bess.

297
00:37:55,052 --> 00:37:58,555
You didn't even consider for one second...

298
00:37:58,556 --> 00:38:02,059
...how painful it must have been for him.

299
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,564
You put your own feelings
before everyone else's.

300
00:38:05,565 --> 00:38:11,071
I can't see that you love him
when you behave like that.

301
00:38:12,072 --> 00:38:16,077
Now you must promise
to be a good girl, Bess.

302
00:38:23,085 --> 00:38:26,089
I promise to be a good girl.

303
00:38:45,612 --> 00:38:48,616
I'm sorry for the way I behaved, mother.

304
00:38:50,117 --> 00:38:51,619
It's all right, Bessie.

305
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:55,623
Mother, would it be ok...

306
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:58,627
...if I came home for a bit
while Jan's away?

307
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:01,214
Of course it would, Bessie.

308
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:16,231
Ok.

309
00:39:16,232 --> 00:39:18,234
You got it.

310
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:28,912
A little bit of this shit.

311
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:34,420
Oh, shit.

312
00:39:38,758 --> 00:39:39,759
Nice.

313
00:39:41,762 --> 00:39:44,765
You know, the waves are
getting pretty heavy.

314
00:39:45,266 --> 00:39:47,768
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck's wrong with you?

315
00:39:47,769 --> 00:39:49,270
Just pissed.
Just give me one.

316
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:51,773
Just wait.

317
00:39:51,774 --> 00:39:54,777
Now, but you know, there's some nice...

318
00:39:55,278 --> 00:39:56,278
Shit.
Sorry, guys.

319
00:39:56,279 --> 00:39:58,280
Just throw the god-damn radio away.

320
00:39:58,281 --> 00:40:00,283
You can't get anything in here anyhow.

321
00:40:00,284 --> 00:40:03,287
You and your fucking radio.

322
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:07,793
Oh, God! Fuck.
Jeez!

323
00:40:08,293 --> 00:40:09,794
Come on.
Dance! Dance!

324
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:18,304
Fire!
Fire!

325
00:40:18,305 --> 00:40:19,806
Wet towel!

326
00:40:19,807 --> 00:40:20,807
Just... shit!

327
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,310
Hey!

328
00:40:23,311 --> 00:40:25,313
Bueno!
Bueno! Bueno!

329
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:44,168
Didn't he say he'd call?

330
00:40:44,169 --> 00:40:46,171
Do you want me to wait with you?

331
00:40:48,174 --> 00:40:50,176
Yes, please.

332
00:40:52,846 --> 00:40:54,931
Where the fuck is the second shift?

333
00:40:54,932 --> 00:40:56,934
I got a phone call to make.

334
00:41:03,859 --> 00:41:05,861
I got to go to the hospital.

335
00:41:08,364 --> 00:41:09,865
Are you cold?

336
00:41:09,866 --> 00:41:10,866
No.

337
00:41:10,867 --> 00:41:12,368
No?

338
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:14,871
You're all right?

339
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:17,375
Don't wait too long, will you?

340
00:41:31,725 --> 00:41:33,728
Oh, shit.

341
00:41:44,991 --> 00:41:47,493
Pim, got to make a phone call.

342
00:41:47,494 --> 00:41:48,996
Get out of here.

343
00:42:22,202 --> 00:42:24,203
Hello?

344
00:42:24,204 --> 00:42:26,706
Is Bess there?

345
00:42:26,707 --> 00:42:28,709
One moment.

346
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:31,213
Bess.
Bess.

347
00:42:40,807 --> 00:42:42,308
Is that you, Bess?

348
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,310
Hi.

349
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,730
I'm sorry I couldn't get
to the phone earlier.

350
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,733
That's ok.

351
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:53,071
Don't you love me any more?

352
00:42:53,072 --> 00:42:57,327
Of course I do.

353
00:42:57,494 --> 00:42:59,078
Say so, then.

354
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:04,584
I'd made up my mind not to.

355
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:07,588
Everyone says that I love you too much...

356
00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:10,091
...and if you found out...

357
00:43:10,092 --> 00:43:12,594
...how much I loved you,

358
00:43:12,595 --> 00:43:15,097
...you might get upset...

359
00:43:15,098 --> 00:43:18,601
...because we're not together right now.

360
00:43:18,602 --> 00:43:20,604
Bess, never stop saying you love me.

361
00:43:21,105 --> 00:43:22,105
You hear?

362
00:43:22,106 --> 00:43:23,607
Yes.

363
00:43:23,608 --> 00:43:25,110
No matter what anybody says.

364
00:43:27,112 --> 00:43:28,614
Yes.

365
00:43:31,617 --> 00:43:33,620
Say it, then.

366
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:40,128
I love you so much.

367
00:43:45,133 --> 00:43:46,635
I love you, too.

368
00:43:56,147 --> 00:43:58,649
I can hear you breathing.

369
00:44:02,154 --> 00:44:04,657
Can you hear me?

370
00:44:41,033 --> 00:44:43,035
What are you thinking?

371
00:44:45,038 --> 00:44:48,041
That you're here.

372
00:44:48,542 --> 00:44:51,044
And what are you doing?

373
00:44:51,045 --> 00:44:57,552
I'm touching your arms...

374
00:44:57,553 --> 00:45:01,056
...and your chest...

375
00:45:01,057 --> 00:45:05,060
...and your tummy

376
00:45:05,061 --> 00:45:05,561
and...

377
00:45:10,568 --> 00:45:13,071
...your prick.

378
00:45:15,574 --> 00:45:17,075
You're so huge.

379
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:26,085
Jan will be home in ten days for a week.

380
00:45:26,086 --> 00:45:27,588
Pardon?

381
00:45:28,089 --> 00:45:32,094
Jan will be home in ten days for a week.

382
00:45:34,096 --> 00:45:35,096
Pits.

383
00:45:35,097 --> 00:45:36,097
Hi.

384
00:45:36,098 --> 00:45:38,600
What are you doing here?

385
00:45:38,601 --> 00:45:41,103
Where's Jan?

386
00:45:41,104 --> 00:45:44,607
I'm the only one back.
Hurt my wrist.

387
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:46,109
They sent me home.

388
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:49,614
He sends his love.

389
00:45:51,617 --> 00:45:53,117
How long have you got off now?

390
00:45:53,118 --> 00:45:54,620
Only three days.

391
00:45:56,122 --> 00:45:58,124
Yeah.
You know me.

392
00:46:00,127 --> 00:46:01,043
I'm back.

393
00:46:01,044 --> 00:46:03,047
Sorry.

394
00:46:12,058 --> 00:46:14,559
How long has she been asleep?

395
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,562
What's the matter with you?

396
00:46:16,563 --> 00:46:18,565
Cat got your tongue?

397
00:46:21,569 --> 00:46:24,071
Have you taken my calendar?

398
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:28,075
Have you taken my calendar?

399
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:29,577
No, I have not.

400
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,580
What would I want with your calendar?

401
00:46:31,581 --> 00:46:33,582
Don't be ridiculous.

402
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:35,084
You've taken it.

403
00:46:35,085 --> 00:46:36,587
I have not taken it.

404
00:46:37,087 --> 00:46:38,588
Yes, you have.

405
00:46:38,589 --> 00:46:40,290
I don't know what you're talking about.

406
00:46:40,391 --> 00:46:42,093
What calendar?

407
00:46:46,598 --> 00:46:48,601
Where is it?

408
00:47:01,366 --> 00:47:03,868
Bess, you've got to
stop all this, you know.

409
00:47:03,869 --> 00:47:06,372
You've got to go on living
when he isn't here.

410
00:47:06,872 --> 00:47:08,392
I mean, he's not dead.
You're not dead.

411
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:10,376
You know what I mean?

412
00:47:10,377 --> 00:47:14,381
You've got to stop it.

413
00:47:37,909 --> 00:47:39,912
It's all right.
It's nothing.

414
00:47:40,412 --> 00:47:41,913
What's going on?

415
00:47:41,914 --> 00:47:43,415
Go back to sleep.
It's all right.

416
00:47:43,416 --> 00:47:44,917
Was that Bess?

417
00:47:44,918 --> 00:47:46,919
No. It's ok.
It's all right.

418
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,004
Bit of hysterics.

419
00:47:48,005 --> 00:47:49,705
No, no. It's all right.
I'll sort it out.

420
00:47:49,806 --> 00:47:51,607
We're not to have this
carry on in the house.

421
00:47:51,708 --> 00:47:53,709
I know. Just stay where you are.
Go back to sleep.

422
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:55,312
It's terrible.

423
00:48:10,948 --> 00:48:16,454
Bess McNeill, for many years,
you've prayed for love.

424
00:48:16,455 --> 00:48:18,957
Shall I take it away from you again?

425
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:20,960
Is that what you want?

426
00:48:22,462 --> 00:48:22,962
Oh, no.

427
00:48:26,467 --> 00:48:28,469
I'm still grateful for love.

428
00:48:31,473 --> 00:48:33,976
What do you want, then?

429
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:42,986
I pray for Jan to come home.

430
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:48,492
He will be coming home in ten days.

431
00:48:48,493 --> 00:48:51,496
You must learn to endure.
You know that.

432
00:48:56,502 --> 00:48:59,005
I can't wait.

433
00:49:04,512 --> 00:49:07,014
This is unlike you, Bess.

434
00:49:07,015 --> 00:49:11,519
Out there, there are people
who need Jan and his work.

435
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,522
What about them?

436
00:49:17,527 --> 00:49:23,033
They don't matter.
Nothing else matters.

437
00:49:23,034 --> 00:49:27,039
I just want Jan home again.

438
00:49:27,539 --> 00:49:30,041
I pray to you.

439
00:49:30,042 --> 00:49:34,047
Please, won't you send him home?

440
00:49:38,552 --> 00:49:42,557
Are you sure that's what you want?

441
00:49:47,062 --> 00:49:49,565
Yes.

442
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:16,764
Ok.
Get her up.

443
00:50:27,277 --> 00:50:29,279
Blow out!

444
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,281
Get away!
Blow out!

445
00:50:32,282 --> 00:50:33,783
Terry!

446
00:50:33,784 --> 00:50:34,785
Terry!

447
00:50:43,379 --> 00:50:44,881
Terry!
Terry!

448
00:50:48,301 --> 00:50:49,303
Terry!

449
00:50:55,643 --> 00:50:57,312
Talk to me, will you?

450
00:51:15,667 --> 00:51:16,668
Watch out!

451
00:51:18,337 --> 00:51:20,338
Jan!

452
00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:23,844
Go get... get a medic!

453
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:45,702
I don't know what kind of
condition he's in.

454
00:51:45,703 --> 00:51:49,122
I think it's very serious, though.

455
00:51:49,123 --> 00:51:51,126
I don't quite know.

456
00:51:58,134 --> 00:52:01,638
It's Jan.
There's been an accident on the rig.

457
00:52:56,787 --> 00:52:59,290
Jan, can you hear me?

458
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:16,059
What are you doing?

459
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:18,562
I'm holding your hand.

460
00:53:18,563 --> 00:53:20,064
Don't touch me.

461
00:53:20,065 --> 00:53:21,565
Don't touch me!

462
00:53:21,566 --> 00:53:23,068
Jan, relax.
Just take...

463
00:53:36,334 --> 00:53:37,836
Sit down here.

464
00:53:42,341 --> 00:53:44,843
All right.
All right.

465
00:53:44,844 --> 00:53:47,346
Deep breath.

466
00:53:47,347 --> 00:53:49,849
Hello.
Talk to me, darling.

467
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:51,851
Talk to me.

468
00:53:51,852 --> 00:53:53,354
Talk to me.

469
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:55,356
Come on.
It's all right.

470
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:59,862
It's all right.
It's going to be all right.

471
00:54:20,031 --> 00:54:22,033
They're going to operate straight away.

472
00:54:22,034 --> 00:54:24,537
It will be a few hours,

473
00:54:24,798 --> 00:54:26,038
...so I think we better wait...

474
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:28,040
Bess.

475
00:54:28,041 --> 00:54:31,043
Bess, you can't go in there.

476
00:54:31,044 --> 00:54:32,645
It's not allowed.
I want to be with him.

477
00:54:32,746 --> 00:54:33,646
I know you do.
I know.

478
00:54:33,747 --> 00:54:35,148
But come on. Come with me.
Come on.

479
00:54:35,249 --> 00:54:36,951
No.
I want to see him all the time.

480
00:54:37,052 --> 00:54:40,054
Bess, it's not a good idea.
Come on.

481
00:54:40,055 --> 00:54:43,059
Bess.
Bess, please, you can't stay here.

482
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:45,060
It's just not possible.

483
00:54:45,061 --> 00:54:46,061
Bess!

484
00:54:46,062 --> 00:54:48,064
Can I have a word with you?

485
00:54:48,065 --> 00:54:51,569
Stay there, all right?
Don't move.

486
00:55:20,186 --> 00:55:23,190
I want you to pray with me.

487
00:55:25,693 --> 00:55:27,027
But...

488
00:55:27,194 --> 00:55:28,696
Please.

489
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:47,886
Dear god, we pray that you...

490
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:51,390
...will hold your hand
over Jan...

491
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:55,393
...and not let him die.

492
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:56,896
Amen.

493
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:35,690
Mrs. Nyman, will you please come with me?

494
00:57:05,209 --> 00:57:07,709
Will he live?

495
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:14,715
We have stabilized your husband's
condition for the time being.

496
00:57:17,717 --> 00:57:20,217
Will he live?

497
00:57:20,218 --> 00:57:23,220
Yes.
Yes, Bess, he will live.

498
00:57:31,225 --> 00:57:34,728
Your husband suffered
very serious injuries.

499
00:57:36,729 --> 00:57:40,231
Life shouldn't always
be preserved at any cost.

500
00:57:42,482 --> 00:57:44,484
What do you mean?

501
00:57:47,486 --> 00:57:49,986
Well, the doctor means, Bess...

502
00:57:49,987 --> 00:57:53,990
...that, sometimes...

503
00:57:54,490 --> 00:57:57,491
...in some cases when
life isn't worth living,

504
00:57:57,492 --> 00:58:00,994
...then it may
be better to die.

505
00:58:05,997 --> 00:58:12,001
You don't know Jan, or you
could not say such a thing.

506
00:58:13,502 --> 00:58:17,003
Your husband may never walk again.

507
00:58:17,004 --> 00:58:20,506
We think he'll be completely paralysed.

508
00:58:22,508 --> 00:58:24,508
But he'll live?

509
00:58:24,509 --> 00:58:28,512
Yes.
He will live, it seems.

510
00:58:38,101 --> 00:58:39,769
Father.

511
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:43,770
Are you there?

512
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:45,772
Are you still there?

513
00:58:50,275 --> 00:58:52,776
Of course I am, Bess.

514
00:58:52,777 --> 00:58:54,278
You know that.

515
00:59:03,784 --> 00:59:06,285
What's happening?

516
00:59:11,789 --> 00:59:15,291
You wanted Jan home.

517
00:59:18,793 --> 00:59:21,294
I've changed my mind.

518
00:59:21,295 --> 00:59:23,296
Why did I ask for that?

519
00:59:26,298 --> 00:59:27,799
Because you're...

520
00:59:28,299 --> 00:59:30,800
...a stupid little girl, Bess.

521
00:59:30,801 --> 00:59:33,802
I had to test you.

522
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:37,805
Your love for Jan
has been put to the test.

523
00:59:46,311 --> 00:59:47,811
Thank you...

524
00:59:47,812 --> 00:59:49,813
...for not letting him die.

525
00:59:54,816 --> 00:59:56,817
You're welcome, Bess.

526
01:00:12,411 --> 01:00:18,413
<i>He said "there is no reason</i>

527
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:21,416
<i>And the truth is plain to see"</i>

528
01:00:24,418 --> 01:00:28,421
<i>But I wandered
through my playing cards</i>

529
01:00:30,922 --> 01:00:34,424
<i>And would not let her be</i>

530
01:00:37,426 --> 01:00:41,429
<i>One of 16 vestal virgins</i>

531
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:46,932
<i>Who were leaving
for the coast</i>

532
01:00:50,435 --> 01:00:54,937
<i>And although
my eyes were open</i>

533
01:00:56,939 --> 01:01:00,440
<i>They might just as well
have been closed</i>

534
01:01:00,441 --> 01:01:02,941
<i>And so it was...</i>

535
01:01:02,942 --> 01:01:06,944
I would say to you...

536
01:01:06,945 --> 01:01:10,446
...that if there is one of
these commandments...

537
01:01:10,447 --> 01:01:15,950
...which you do not love
and do not obey,

538
01:01:15,951 --> 01:01:19,953
...you have no place
at the Lord's table.

539
01:01:44,594 --> 01:01:46,094
When did you get back?

540
01:01:46,095 --> 01:01:47,596
I came back with Jan.

541
01:01:48,096 --> 01:01:50,097
It's good to see you.

542
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:09,775
Surf's up!

543
01:02:09,776 --> 01:02:10,901
Hi.

544
01:02:10,902 --> 01:02:11,903
Hi, guys.

545
01:02:12,403 --> 01:02:13,403
How you doing, buddy?

546
01:02:13,404 --> 01:02:15,404
Well, fine.
How are you?

547
01:02:15,405 --> 01:02:16,906
Ok.

548
01:02:19,908 --> 01:02:21,409
Did you find anything?

549
01:02:21,909 --> 01:02:23,409
Gas.

550
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:24,910
Nothing really.

551
01:02:24,911 --> 01:02:26,911
Guess what, now.

552
01:02:26,912 --> 01:02:28,412
We're heading up north.

553
01:02:28,413 --> 01:02:29,914
Well, north, that's good.

554
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:32,916
That's where you always said the oil was.

555
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:35,291
What are you doing here, anyway?

556
01:02:35,292 --> 01:02:37,294
We're meant to be out drilling.

557
01:02:38,795 --> 01:02:40,295
I just felt like...

558
01:02:40,296 --> 01:02:42,797
Putting my feet up for a while.

559
01:02:42,922 --> 01:02:46,425
I didn't trust you
two guys out there alone.

560
01:02:58,182 --> 01:03:00,182
Oh, my...

561
01:03:00,183 --> 01:03:03,184
My arms aren't ok, so...

562
01:03:03,185 --> 01:03:05,687
I'm not thirsty, anyway.

563
01:03:07,688 --> 01:03:10,690
Bullshit!

564
01:03:14,817 --> 01:03:16,818
Hey, come on.

565
01:03:16,819 --> 01:03:18,320
Come on.

566
01:03:20,821 --> 01:03:22,823
Oh, man, sorry.

567
01:03:29,327 --> 01:03:30,828
Oh, man, sorry.

568
01:03:31,328 --> 01:03:32,828
Ok.

569
01:03:32,829 --> 01:03:34,830
Thank you.

570
01:03:45,587 --> 01:03:49,588
I'm not really supposed to
have any visitors, so...

571
01:03:49,589 --> 01:03:52,090
We really don't have the time, either.

572
01:03:52,091 --> 01:03:54,091
Ok.

573
01:03:54,092 --> 01:03:56,094
You take care of yourself?

574
01:03:56,594 --> 01:03:59,094
Take care.
Get well soon.

575
01:03:59,095 --> 01:04:00,596
See you, guys.

576
01:04:12,104 --> 01:04:14,604
Will you do something for me?

577
01:04:14,605 --> 01:04:16,106
Yes.

578
01:04:18,608 --> 01:04:20,608
The next time you come,

579
01:04:20,609 --> 01:04:22,110
...could you wear something more...

580
01:04:24,111 --> 01:04:26,113
More loose...

581
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:31,115
So I...

582
01:04:31,116 --> 01:04:33,617
So I won't have to see your body.

583
01:05:12,142 --> 01:05:15,143
Bess, you'll have to go now...

584
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:17,145
...because Jan needs to rest.

585
01:05:17,645 --> 01:05:19,146
All right.

586
01:05:31,404 --> 01:05:33,904
You shouldn't get him
too overemotional, you know.

587
01:05:33,905 --> 01:05:35,906
It's not good for him.

588
01:05:35,907 --> 01:05:38,407
I'm sorry.

589
01:05:38,408 --> 01:05:40,910
You got to cheer him up.

590
01:05:44,412 --> 01:05:46,412
Is he asleep now?

591
01:05:46,413 --> 01:05:48,415
Well, he should be...

592
01:05:48,915 --> 01:05:50,916
...the amount I've given him.

593
01:05:52,542 --> 01:05:54,042
Would it be all right...

594
01:05:54,043 --> 01:05:57,045
...If I went and had a look at him?

595
01:06:17,058 --> 01:06:19,559
I love you, Jan.

596
01:06:28,065 --> 01:06:32,066
I love you, too, Bess.

597
01:06:32,067 --> 01:06:35,569
You are the love of my life.

598
01:06:56,124 --> 01:06:58,125
Bess.

599
01:07:01,127 --> 01:07:03,127
Where have you been?

600
01:07:03,128 --> 01:07:05,630
I've been to the church.

601
01:07:08,632 --> 01:07:11,133
What, at 2:00 in the morning?

602
01:07:17,137 --> 01:07:19,639
I don't want you getting ill again...

603
01:07:20,139 --> 01:07:21,639
...like you did when Sam died.

604
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,640
I said I've been to the church.

605
01:07:23,641 --> 01:07:25,643
It has nothing to do with the church.

606
01:07:26,143 --> 01:07:29,145
Did you hear what I said?
Did you?

607
01:07:30,646 --> 01:07:33,146
I don't want you to get ill again.

608
01:07:33,147 --> 01:07:35,648
Like you did when Sam died.

609
01:07:35,649 --> 01:07:39,150
I've had a word with Dr. Richardson,
all right?

610
01:07:39,151 --> 01:07:42,152
And he says he could see you tomorrow.

611
01:07:42,153 --> 01:07:44,655
Can he?

612
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:55,161
Bess, would you like to come in?

613
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:19,801
Dodo said I had to come.

614
01:08:19,802 --> 01:08:23,679
She has this idea about me treating you.

615
01:08:26,681 --> 01:08:30,183
My predecessor admitted you
a few years ago.

616
01:08:31,184 --> 01:08:33,686
Well, why did he do that?

617
01:08:34,186 --> 01:08:36,186
I don't know.

618
01:08:36,187 --> 01:08:38,688
No, nor do I.

619
01:08:38,689 --> 01:08:41,690
You were upset because
your brother had died...

620
01:08:41,691 --> 01:08:45,442
...and now you're upset
because your husband's ill.

621
01:08:45,443 --> 01:08:47,444
Nothing unusual about that.

622
01:08:49,946 --> 01:08:52,948
Am I not going to have some pills?

623
01:08:53,448 --> 01:08:55,448
I'm probably not like your old doctor.

624
01:08:55,449 --> 01:08:57,950
I don't think that people
should be given pills...

625
01:08:57,951 --> 01:08:59,952
...just because they do
what's only natural.

626
01:09:01,203 --> 01:09:04,204
Maybe showing what you feel
isn't the done thing...

627
01:09:04,205 --> 01:09:05,705
...from where you come from,

628
01:09:05,706 --> 01:09:08,207
...but it's certainly no disease.

629
01:09:09,208 --> 01:09:12,209
What... happened on the rig...

630
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:14,211
...was my fault.

631
01:09:15,712 --> 01:09:17,213
How come?

632
01:09:19,214 --> 01:09:22,216
I prayed to God to send him home.

633
01:09:24,718 --> 01:09:26,719
Well...

634
01:09:30,221 --> 01:09:32,222
Well...

635
01:09:32,223 --> 01:09:35,224
What powers you possess.

636
01:09:35,225 --> 01:09:36,725
Do you really...

637
01:09:37,226 --> 01:09:39,727
Do you really believe
that you possess such powers?

638
01:09:41,228 --> 01:09:45,105
I know you people believe
a lot about yourselves.

639
01:09:45,106 --> 01:09:46,606
Bess...

640
01:09:46,607 --> 01:09:49,107
Perhaps you should do a bit of grieving...

641
01:09:49,108 --> 01:09:50,609
...for yourself instead of him.

642
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:53,110
I think you should come and see me...

643
01:09:53,111 --> 01:09:55,112
...now and again if you feel like it.

644
01:10:00,991 --> 01:10:02,991
I'm sorry.

645
01:10:04,493 --> 01:10:05,994
Come on.

646
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:10,872
Well, things will pick up
once he gets home again.

647
01:10:17,626 --> 01:10:19,627
<i>Well, she's my woman of gold</i>

648
01:10:19,628 --> 01:10:22,629
<i>Yes, she's not very old,
uh-huh, huh</i>

649
01:10:25,131 --> 01:10:27,131
<i>Well, she's my woman of gold</i>

650
01:10:27,132 --> 01:10:30,134
<i>Yes, she's not very old,
uh-huh, huh</i>

651
01:10:32,636 --> 01:10:35,137
<i>I don't mean to be bold, uh</i>

652
01:10:35,262 --> 01:10:39,139
<i>But, uh, may I hold your hand?</i>

653
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:41,642
<i>Well, she ain't no witch</i>

654
01:10:42,142 --> 01:10:44,643
<i>and I love the way she twitch
uh-huh, huh</i>

655
01:10:47,145 --> 01:10:49,145
<i>Well, she ain't no witch</i>

656
01:10:49,146 --> 01:10:52,647
<i>and I love the way she twitch
uh-huh, huh...</i>

657
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:56,650
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

658
01:10:56,651 --> 01:11:00,152
<i>Squashed tomatoes and stew</i>

659
01:11:00,153 --> 01:11:04,280
<i>You look like a monkey</i>

660
01:11:04,281 --> 01:11:08,283
<i>and I thought it was you</i>

661
01:11:08,408 --> 01:11:10,409
Look at that.

662
01:11:10,410 --> 01:11:11,911
Special.

663
01:11:12,411 --> 01:11:13,911
Shall I open your present?

664
01:11:13,912 --> 01:11:15,413
Yes.

665
01:11:16,914 --> 01:11:18,415
Your presents.

666
01:11:22,918 --> 01:11:24,919
Can you see all right?

667
01:11:27,921 --> 01:11:29,921
What is it?

668
01:11:29,922 --> 01:11:31,423
Wait and see.

669
01:11:37,927 --> 01:11:39,927
I don't believe it.

670
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:41,929
Where did you get that?

671
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:43,931
I got it in a shop.

672
01:11:48,559 --> 01:11:51,059
That is the stupidest thing I've ever seen.

673
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:54,061
Look, it's not doing anything now.

674
01:11:54,062 --> 01:11:56,564
Ahem. All right, go on.
Well, go on.

675
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:02,568
That is just terrible.

676
01:12:10,448 --> 01:12:14,450
That is daft, that is completely daft.

677
01:12:15,826 --> 01:12:17,326
Happy birthday, Jan.

678
01:12:17,327 --> 01:12:18,827
Thank you.

679
01:12:18,828 --> 01:12:20,329
I'll see you later.

680
01:12:25,332 --> 01:12:27,333
Do you like it?

681
01:12:28,834 --> 01:12:30,835
Yes, it's...

682
01:12:32,336 --> 01:12:34,838
It's... it's nice.

683
01:12:36,339 --> 01:12:38,340
I'll give you your pill.

684
01:12:50,848 --> 01:12:52,848
Ok?

685
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:55,851
One more drink.

686
01:12:59,354 --> 01:13:00,853
Ok?

687
01:13:00,854 --> 01:13:02,856
Yeah.
Thank you.

688
01:13:13,863 --> 01:13:15,864
Happy birthday.

689
01:13:26,246 --> 01:13:28,747
I'm finished, Bess.

690
01:13:31,749 --> 01:13:33,250
No.

691
01:13:37,002 --> 01:13:38,502
You could take a lover...

692
01:13:38,503 --> 01:13:40,505
...without anybody noticing...

693
01:13:44,132 --> 01:13:46,132
...but you can't divorce me.

694
01:13:46,133 --> 01:13:48,134
They'd never let you.

695
01:14:14,526 --> 01:14:16,651
Bess.

696
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:17,653
No.
No.

697
01:14:23,157 --> 01:14:26,659
Is that what you think I want?

698
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:30,661
You cripple!

699
01:14:53,301 --> 01:14:54,927
You must make up with him.

700
01:14:55,427 --> 01:14:56,927
A husband and wife...

701
01:14:56,928 --> 01:14:59,929
...have to be able to talk to each other.

702
01:14:59,930 --> 01:15:02,430
He's the one who is helpless,

703
01:15:02,431 --> 01:15:03,932
...and you're the one...

704
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:07,433
...who must show you're strong.

705
01:15:07,434 --> 01:15:09,935
Go to him and tell him...

706
01:15:09,936 --> 01:15:12,937
...you are sorry you were angry.

707
01:15:12,938 --> 01:15:14,939
You have God.

708
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:16,940
You have the strength...

709
01:15:16,941 --> 01:15:20,442
...your life in God has bestowed upon you,

710
01:15:20,443 --> 01:15:25,071
...and that is a strength
he does not possess.

711
01:16:28,986 --> 01:16:30,986
Oh, no.

712
01:16:30,987 --> 01:16:33,488
Come on.

713
01:16:33,489 --> 01:16:35,989
Come on.
You're all right.

714
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:37,867
Come on.
That's it.

715
01:16:38,367 --> 01:16:40,868
That's it.
It's all right.

716
01:16:40,869 --> 01:16:43,370
It's all right.
All right, all right.

717
01:16:46,247 --> 01:16:47,747
What's she thinking of...

718
01:16:47,748 --> 01:16:50,749
Going off leaving you like this?

719
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:53,251
You must admit that she was...

720
01:16:56,253 --> 01:16:59,255
She was happy when we got married.

721
01:17:03,633 --> 01:17:06,134
She blossomed...

722
01:17:06,135 --> 01:17:08,636
Didn't she?

723
01:17:15,015 --> 01:17:17,016
I can't just lie here.

724
01:17:20,519 --> 01:17:24,021
I can't even make love to her.

725
01:17:25,772 --> 01:17:27,773
She's got to get out of here.

726
01:17:29,774 --> 01:17:32,776
She's got to get on with life.

727
01:17:33,277 --> 01:17:34,778
Help me set her free.

728
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:44,158
She'd do anything for you, Jan.

729
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:46,159
You know that.

730
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,661
She don't care... anything about herself...

731
01:17:50,663 --> 01:17:52,664
...but she'd do anything for you...

732
01:17:54,165 --> 01:17:57,167
just to see a smile on your face.

733
01:17:58,167 --> 01:17:59,668
Do you understand me?

734
01:18:03,671 --> 01:18:05,171
Yeah.

735
01:18:05,172 --> 01:18:07,173
Right.

736
01:18:09,174 --> 01:18:11,300
Thanks for telling me.

737
01:18:11,301 --> 01:18:12,802
No trouble.

738
01:18:15,804 --> 01:18:18,304
Do you want me to read to you?

739
01:18:23,308 --> 01:18:24,809
Are you all right?

740
01:19:13,257 --> 01:19:15,758
They took him back to the hospital.

741
01:19:19,135 --> 01:19:20,636
Bess.

742
01:19:21,136 --> 01:19:22,136
Bess, what is going on?

743
01:19:22,137 --> 01:19:24,638
He went unconscious.
We had to bring him back here.

744
01:19:24,639 --> 01:19:26,639
At home any more...

745
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,241
Not if you're going to go running off...

746
01:19:28,481 --> 01:19:29,641
...and leaving him like that.

747
01:19:29,642 --> 01:19:31,142
I'm sorry.

748
01:19:31,143 --> 01:19:33,143
Well, it's just not good enough!

749
01:19:33,144 --> 01:19:35,645
I'm not... I'm not even allowed
to kiss him any more.

750
01:19:35,646 --> 01:19:39,147
Why don't you try listening to
what he says, Bess?

751
01:19:39,148 --> 01:19:40,649
It's up to you.

752
01:19:41,149 --> 01:19:43,149
He ain't got anyone else.

753
01:19:43,150 --> 01:19:45,151
You could give him the will to live.

754
01:19:45,152 --> 01:19:47,653
That's more than any doctor can do.

755
01:20:02,162 --> 01:20:04,664
Bess?

756
01:20:04,789 --> 01:20:06,790
I'm sorry.

757
01:20:09,167 --> 01:20:11,167
No, it was my fault.

758
01:20:11,168 --> 01:20:12,669
Come here.

759
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:22,800
Hi.

760
01:20:23,051 --> 01:20:24,552
Hi.

761
01:20:31,806 --> 01:20:34,308
Love is a mighty power...

762
01:20:35,809 --> 01:20:37,310
Isn't it?

763
01:20:41,312 --> 01:20:43,312
If I die...

764
01:20:43,313 --> 01:20:47,566
It will be because love
cannot keep me alive.

765
01:20:48,567 --> 01:20:51,068
But I can hardly remember...

766
01:20:51,193 --> 01:20:54,195
...what it's like to make love.

767
01:20:54,696 --> 01:20:57,196
And if I forget that...

768
01:20:57,197 --> 01:20:59,324
...then I'll die.

769
01:21:03,201 --> 01:21:07,204
Remember when I phoned you from the rig?

770
01:21:07,704 --> 01:21:10,705
We made love without being together.

771
01:21:10,706 --> 01:21:12,706
Do you want me to talk
to you like that again?

772
01:21:12,707 --> 01:21:13,707
I'd love to.

773
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:15,209
Bess.

774
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:21,212
I want you to find
a man to make love to...

775
01:21:21,429 --> 01:21:24,931
...and then come back here
and tell me about it.

776
01:21:25,111 --> 01:21:28,716
It will feel like you and me
being together again.

777
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:32,219
Now, that... that will keep me alive.

778
01:21:37,285 --> 01:21:39,787
I can't.

779
01:21:41,913 --> 01:21:47,917
This morning when I...
When I told you to get a lover,

780
01:21:48,417 --> 01:21:50,417
It wasn't for your sake.

781
01:21:50,418 --> 01:21:51,919
It was for my sake...

782
01:21:55,672 --> 01:21:57,673
...because I don't want to die.

783
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:03,051
I'm afraid.

784
01:22:06,053 --> 01:22:07,554
Do you understand?

785
01:22:09,055 --> 01:22:10,930
Yes.

786
01:22:10,931 --> 01:22:13,433
It will be you and me, Bess.

787
01:22:13,933 --> 01:22:15,434
Do it for me.

788
01:22:19,562 --> 01:22:21,563
I can't.

789
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:25,190
Please.

790
01:22:36,698 --> 01:22:38,698
Bess?

791
01:22:38,699 --> 01:22:40,200
Are you all right?

792
01:22:41,701 --> 01:22:43,202
Sure?

793
01:22:48,205 --> 01:22:49,706
Here you go.

794
01:22:52,207 --> 01:22:54,959
Easy.

795
01:22:57,502 --> 01:23:00,462
<i>Suzanne takes you down...</i>

796
01:23:00,463 --> 01:23:04,964
<i>...to her place near the river</i>

797
01:23:04,965 --> 01:23:07,966
<i>You can hear the boats go by,</i>

798
01:23:07,967 --> 01:23:11,427
<i>...you can spend the night, beside her.</i>

799
01:23:11,428 --> 01:23:14,930
<i>And you know
that she's half crazy,</i>

800
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:18,932
<i>But that's why
you want to be there</i>

801
01:23:18,933 --> 01:23:21,934
<i>and she feeds you
tea and oranges...</i>

802
01:23:21,935 --> 01:23:25,436
<i>...that come all the way from China</i>

803
01:23:25,437 --> 01:23:29,438
<i>And just when you mean
to tell her,</i>

804
01:23:29,439 --> 01:23:32,940
<i>that you have no love
to give her</i>

805
01:23:32,941 --> 01:23:36,401
<i>Then she gets you
on her wavelength</i>

806
01:23:36,402 --> 01:23:39,404
<i>And she lets the river answer</i>

807
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:43,657
<i>That you've always been her lover</i>

808
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:52,662
You certainly needed some shut-eye.

809
01:23:55,664 --> 01:23:59,165
I put your rose in a vase.

810
01:23:59,166 --> 01:24:01,168
Perked up a bit.

811
01:24:08,422 --> 01:24:10,924
You should think of yourself a bit, too.

812
01:24:11,424 --> 01:24:13,425
Go out.

813
01:24:14,926 --> 01:24:17,427
Go dancing.

814
01:24:17,428 --> 01:24:19,429
I've seen you dance.

815
01:24:22,931 --> 01:24:24,933
You like to dance.

816
01:24:34,126 --> 01:24:35,940
Where's Jan?

817
01:24:39,817 --> 01:24:42,319
There's nothing you can do in here.

818
01:24:44,945 --> 01:24:46,947
Don't let him die.

819
01:24:50,449 --> 01:24:53,951
And why shouldn't I let him die?

820
01:24:56,953 --> 01:24:58,954
I love him.

821
01:25:00,955 --> 01:25:04,957
So you keep saying, but I don't see it.

822
01:25:04,958 --> 01:25:09,960
There's nothing I can do.

823
01:25:09,961 --> 01:25:12,463
There's nothing at all.

824
01:25:20,468 --> 01:25:23,969
Prove to me that you love him...

825
01:25:23,970 --> 01:25:25,471
...and then I'll let him live.

826
01:25:44,525 --> 01:25:47,026
I've come to dance.

827
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:02,910
It's great. You're great.
Great movement...

828
01:26:02,911 --> 01:26:04,913
But, maybe you could talk to me.

829
01:26:09,666 --> 01:26:13,668
<i>And love lies bleeding in my hand</i>

830
01:26:15,794 --> 01:26:21,298
<i>Oh, it kills me to think
of you with another man</i>

831
01:26:22,424 --> 01:26:23,924
<i>I was playing...</i>

832
01:26:23,925 --> 01:26:25,925
Bess, stop dancing.
Talk to me.

833
01:26:25,926 --> 01:26:27,926
<i>But my guitar couldn't hold you</i>

834
01:26:27,927 --> 01:26:28,928
<i>So I split the band</i>

835
01:26:30,804 --> 01:26:33,305
Bess...

836
01:26:33,806 --> 01:26:35,806
Talk to me.

837
01:26:35,807 --> 01:26:39,309
Give me five minutes.

838
01:27:04,450 --> 01:27:06,952
You can touch me now.

839
01:27:09,954 --> 01:27:13,955
You can have me now.

840
01:27:13,956 --> 01:27:15,956
Bess, listen to me.

841
01:27:15,957 --> 01:27:18,458
We're not going to make love.

842
01:27:18,459 --> 01:27:20,460
Now put your clothes back on.

843
01:27:22,962 --> 01:27:24,963
Don't you want me?

844
01:27:27,465 --> 01:27:31,967
Don't you like me?
You said that you liked me.

845
01:27:31,968 --> 01:27:33,968
Yes, Bess, I like you.

846
01:27:33,969 --> 01:27:35,970
Now put your clothes on.

847
01:27:36,470 --> 01:27:39,972
But you don't understand.
I'll...

848
01:27:39,973 --> 01:27:41,974
I'll be good to you, and...

849
01:27:43,850 --> 01:27:45,850
I want us to make love.

850
01:27:45,851 --> 01:27:48,352
Listen.
Bess...

851
01:27:48,353 --> 01:27:50,853
If you want to talk to me...

852
01:27:50,854 --> 01:27:53,355
...we can meet at the hospital.

853
01:27:53,356 --> 01:27:56,357
Now just put your clothes on, Bess.

854
01:27:56,358 --> 01:27:57,858
No...

855
01:27:57,859 --> 01:28:00,860
Please.
I don't know what to do with you.

856
01:28:00,861 --> 01:28:05,363
All right, now just put
your clothes on, Bess,

857
01:28:05,364 --> 01:28:07,865
...and go home.

858
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:09,866
No.

859
01:28:19,998 --> 01:28:26,001
I'm lying on my back, all naked.

860
01:28:26,002 --> 01:28:28,002
And...

861
01:28:28,003 --> 01:28:31,005
...he comes in, and he sees me.

862
01:28:34,507 --> 01:28:38,510
And he kisses my breasts.

863
01:28:44,513 --> 01:28:48,016
And he enters me...

864
01:28:52,018 --> 01:28:54,018
And...

865
01:28:54,019 --> 01:28:58,522
And he's making love to me...

866
01:29:01,524 --> 01:29:03,524
Gently...

867
01:29:03,525 --> 01:29:06,027
And...

868
01:29:07,528 --> 01:29:09,529
He's coming.

869
01:29:30,918 --> 01:29:33,169
It was Dr. Richardson.

870
01:29:57,726 --> 01:29:59,727
Hi.

871
01:29:59,728 --> 01:30:00,728
Hi, Bess.

872
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:03,230
Where are you going, then?

873
01:30:09,359 --> 01:30:11,319
Jan, we're going to
take you off the respirator...

874
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,861
...for five minutes to exercise
your lungs a little bit...

875
01:30:13,862 --> 01:30:15,361
...and see how you are,

876
01:30:15,362 --> 01:30:17,864
...so just relax and take it easy.

877
01:30:22,867 --> 01:30:26,368
Ok, start to breathe by yourself, now, Jan.

878
01:30:26,369 --> 01:30:28,870
Just take very deep breaths.

879
01:30:28,871 --> 01:30:30,871
Slowly.

880
01:30:30,872 --> 01:30:32,873
That's it.

881
01:30:32,874 --> 01:30:35,375
And again.

882
01:30:39,378 --> 01:30:41,378
Very good.

883
01:30:41,379 --> 01:30:43,879
Deep breaths.

884
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:45,381
Now, that's it.

885
01:30:55,388 --> 01:30:57,388
Bess.

886
01:30:57,389 --> 01:30:58,890
Yes?

887
01:31:07,395 --> 01:31:12,399
What are you doing on this bus?

888
01:31:12,899 --> 01:31:14,400
Which bus, Jan?

889
01:31:17,902 --> 01:31:22,405
Come to me.
Come.

890
01:31:26,908 --> 01:31:32,410
I'm here.
I'm here in the back.

891
01:31:32,411 --> 01:31:33,911
Yes.

892
01:31:33,912 --> 01:31:35,912
In the back of the bus.

893
01:31:35,913 --> 01:31:36,913
Yeah.

894
01:31:36,914 --> 01:31:37,915
Come.

895
01:31:41,917 --> 01:31:45,920
Dodo.
Dodo.

896
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:48,922
Jan.

897
01:31:49,422 --> 01:31:50,923
Go and get Dr. Richardson.

898
01:31:51,423 --> 01:31:54,925
I'm going to put you back
on the respirator now, Jan.

899
01:31:56,426 --> 01:31:58,927
Jan, can you hear me?

900
01:31:58,928 --> 01:32:00,929
Are you awake?

901
01:32:03,431 --> 01:32:04,932
Talk to me.

902
01:32:13,937 --> 01:32:15,438
Hi, Bess.

903
01:32:15,939 --> 01:32:18,440
I'd like to have a chat with you.

904
01:32:20,442 --> 01:32:21,942
Bess.

905
01:32:25,445 --> 01:32:28,947
This is my bus... My bus.

906
01:35:18,054 --> 01:35:22,056
Forgive me, father.
I have sinned.

907
01:35:28,060 --> 01:35:30,561
Mary Magdalene sinned,

908
01:35:30,562 --> 01:35:33,564
...and she is among my dearly beloved.

909
01:36:01,706 --> 01:36:06,334
I go to the back of the bus...

910
01:36:06,835 --> 01:36:08,836
...and you're there.

911
01:36:14,339 --> 01:36:18,342
And you're so huge...

912
01:36:18,842 --> 01:36:22,845
...that you're almost
bursting out of your pants.

913
01:36:28,348 --> 01:36:32,351
And I undo your fly...

914
01:36:35,853 --> 01:36:38,355
...and I touch you.

915
01:36:41,356 --> 01:36:44,734
I'm touching your prick.

916
01:37:22,507 --> 01:37:26,010
Have you been in to see Jan?

917
01:37:27,010 --> 01:37:28,510
How is he?

918
01:37:28,511 --> 01:37:30,011
Better.

919
01:37:30,012 --> 01:37:31,512
He's better?

920
01:37:31,513 --> 01:37:33,014
Just a bit.

921
01:37:39,518 --> 01:37:41,518
Hey, Bess, it looks like...

922
01:37:41,519 --> 01:37:43,019
...your prayers have been answered.

923
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:46,522
We've been able to take
him off the respirator.

924
01:37:46,523 --> 01:37:48,524
Good news, isn't it?

925
01:37:59,031 --> 01:38:00,531
Do you think...

926
01:38:03,533 --> 01:38:07,035
...that we turn to different people

927
01:38:07,036 --> 01:38:10,537
...when we get close to the edge?

928
01:38:10,538 --> 01:38:13,540
And that we...

929
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:19,043
...we turn bad when we're going to die?

930
01:38:21,545 --> 01:38:25,546
You're not going to die.

931
01:38:25,547 --> 01:38:29,049
I know you're not.

932
01:38:29,550 --> 01:38:32,051
I promise you.

933
01:38:39,598 --> 01:38:43,599
<i>When are you
gonna come down?</i>

934
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:47,602
<i>When are you going to land?</i>

935
01:38:47,603 --> 01:38:50,604
<i>I should have stayed
on the farm</i>

936
01:38:50,605 --> 01:38:55,107
<i>I should have listened
to my old man?</i>

937
01:38:55,108 --> 01:38:59,109
<i>You know you can't hold me forever</i>

938
01:38:59,110 --> 01:39:03,112
<i>I didn't sign up with you</i>

939
01:39:03,113 --> 01:39:07,114
<i>I'm not a present
for your friends to open</i>

940
01:39:07,115 --> 01:39:10,616
<i>This boy's too young to be singing...</i>

941
01:39:10,617 --> 01:39:15,621
<i>...the blues...</i>

942
01:39:18,101 --> 01:39:19,602
Look!

943
01:39:37,489 --> 01:39:39,490
Here you go.

944
01:39:47,745 --> 01:39:52,248
Hey, hey, girlies!
We found some shroomies!

945
01:40:02,504 --> 01:40:06,507
Don't get your hopes up too high, will you?

946
01:40:06,590 --> 01:40:10,009
Dr. Richardson says that
Jan could get worse again.

947
01:40:11,510 --> 01:40:14,511
I'm the one who saved his life.

948
01:40:14,512 --> 01:40:16,513
I can save it again.

949
01:40:17,014 --> 01:40:21,015
Bess, what are you talking about?

950
01:40:21,016 --> 01:40:26,519
I told Jan stories...
Stories about love.

951
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:30,522
That was almost like
being together, him and me.

952
01:40:32,023 --> 01:40:34,524
You see, love can save Jan.

953
01:40:34,525 --> 01:40:37,025
He must not forget about love.

954
01:40:37,026 --> 01:40:38,526
He told me that.

955
01:40:38,527 --> 01:40:41,529
He tells me what to do.

956
01:40:42,029 --> 01:40:44,530
Bess, I'm glad that you listened to Jan,

957
01:40:44,531 --> 01:40:47,532
...but don't let him gain
too much power over you.

958
01:40:47,533 --> 01:40:49,783
Sickness is a mighty power.

959
01:40:49,784 --> 01:40:51,284
I've saved Jan.

960
01:40:51,285 --> 01:40:54,287
Don't talk like that.
It's stupid!

961
01:40:55,788 --> 01:40:58,289
You always said that I wasn't stupid.

962
01:40:58,290 --> 01:41:00,791
Well, you're stupid if you
say things like that.

963
01:41:01,292 --> 01:41:03,417
Why are you saying I'm stupid now?

964
01:41:03,418 --> 01:41:05,918
Because I can see
that you're disappearing...

965
01:41:05,919 --> 01:41:07,419
...into a world
of make-believe,

966
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:09,421
...and it worries me.

967
01:41:09,422 --> 01:41:10,922
I used to go mad...

968
01:41:10,923 --> 01:41:12,423
...when people called you stupid,

969
01:41:12,424 --> 01:41:15,717
But... you are stupid!

970
01:41:17,218 --> 01:41:20,219
We're going to put
a drain in this afternoon.

971
01:41:20,220 --> 01:41:24,222
It'll be much easier
to get through to him.

972
01:41:24,223 --> 01:41:27,225
Don't worry.
It's a very minor operation.

973
01:41:28,726 --> 01:41:32,727
Are you trying to make me feel guilty?

974
01:41:32,728 --> 01:41:35,230
What makes you say that?

975
01:41:39,607 --> 01:41:43,110
I think she's trying
to make me feel guilty.

976
01:41:51,115 --> 01:41:52,616
Come here.

977
01:41:58,369 --> 01:42:00,371
You look fucking awful.

978
01:42:04,873 --> 01:42:07,000
Why do you dress like that?

979
01:42:10,502 --> 01:42:14,003
You dress like a widow.

980
01:42:14,004 --> 01:42:16,756
I'm not even dead yet.

981
01:42:19,758 --> 01:42:22,258
Maybe you wish I was.

982
01:42:22,259 --> 01:42:24,135
No.
No, no.

983
01:42:24,136 --> 01:42:27,512
You haven't done what I asked you to do.

984
01:42:27,513 --> 01:42:29,013
I have!

985
01:42:29,014 --> 01:42:32,016
I asked you to be with a man.

986
01:42:32,516 --> 01:42:34,016
I have done that.

987
01:42:34,017 --> 01:42:37,018
You call that being with a man?

988
01:42:37,019 --> 01:42:39,020
I call it a joke.

989
01:42:45,024 --> 01:42:49,402
I love you.
I don't love some other man.

990
01:42:51,403 --> 01:42:52,904
Prove it.

991
01:42:59,283 --> 01:43:01,283
Bess, what is going on?

992
01:43:01,284 --> 01:43:06,787
Are you sleeping with other men
to feed his sick fantasies?

993
01:43:06,788 --> 01:43:08,788
He did get better.

994
01:43:08,789 --> 01:43:11,289
No, he did not get better!

995
01:43:11,290 --> 01:43:12,790
That's just the way it goes, Bess.

996
01:43:12,791 --> 01:43:14,792
Sometimes he's better;
Sometimes he's worse.

997
01:43:14,793 --> 01:43:18,294
It has nothing to do with what you're doing.
That's all in your mind.

998
01:43:18,295 --> 01:43:22,297
He is my husband, and god has
said that I must honour him.

999
01:43:22,398 --> 01:43:24,298
Well, if that's what
honouring is all about...

1000
01:43:24,299 --> 01:43:26,799
...then I must have something wrong.

1001
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:29,302
Well, you don't come from
around here, do you?

1002
01:43:29,802 --> 01:43:31,802
No, and I'm glad I don't.

1003
01:43:31,803 --> 01:43:35,305
With locals talking.
It makes me sick.

1004
01:43:35,306 --> 01:43:38,306
But you live here,
and you go to the church.

1005
01:43:38,307 --> 01:43:42,809
Yes, but it don't mean I don't
look at things me own way.

1006
01:43:42,810 --> 01:43:45,812
Why don't you move, then?
Your husband's dead.

1007
01:43:47,563 --> 01:43:50,564
You know very well why I don't move.

1008
01:43:50,565 --> 01:43:53,066
I don't move because of you.

1009
01:43:53,067 --> 01:43:57,068
A woman has to choose for herself, Bess.

1010
01:43:57,069 --> 01:44:00,071
She has to have a mind of her own.

1011
01:44:00,281 --> 01:44:04,328
Now, what you're doing is making
things worse. It's nonsense.

1012
01:44:04,329 --> 01:44:05,788
His head's full of scars.

1013
01:44:05,789 --> 01:44:07,205
He's up to his eyeballs in drugs.

1014
01:44:07,206 --> 01:44:08,527
He doesn't know what he's saying.

1015
01:44:11,001 --> 01:44:12,956
And he doesn't know.

1016
01:44:17,554 --> 01:44:18,555
I'm sorry.

1017
01:44:20,966 --> 01:44:22,968
I'm sorry.

1018
01:44:25,138 --> 01:44:27,640
Am I going to go to hell?

1019
01:44:27,641 --> 01:44:34,650
Whom do you want to save...
yourself or Jan?

1020
01:44:38,279 --> 01:44:39,281
Bess.

1021
01:44:41,784 --> 01:44:45,288
It's been a long time... most unlike you.

1022
01:44:48,292 --> 01:44:51,296
I must warn you that
the Lord looks with anger...

1023
01:44:51,546 --> 01:44:53,549
...upon those who fail him.

1024
01:45:07,942 --> 01:45:10,946
You've got to lend me something to wear.

1025
01:45:36,854 --> 01:45:38,356
A good shot.

1026
01:45:47,367 --> 01:45:49,369
All right.
All right.

1027
01:46:00,509 --> 01:46:02,010
Hello.

1028
01:46:06,516 --> 01:46:08,018
Good shot.

1029
01:46:12,524 --> 01:46:14,026
How much, darling?

1030
01:46:24,235 --> 01:46:26,717
1, 2, 3, up.

1031
01:46:26,936 --> 01:46:29,291
Ok.
Good.

1032
01:46:48,903 --> 01:46:50,405
Thank you.

1033
01:46:53,910 --> 01:46:55,911
I can't hear the blood pressure.

1034
01:46:55,912 --> 01:46:57,915
The blood pressure.

1035
01:46:58,165 --> 01:47:00,168
We have a fibrillation.

1036
01:47:05,424 --> 01:47:08,427
Clear.

1037
01:47:08,428 --> 01:47:10,431
Still no change.

1038
01:47:10,681 --> 01:47:13,184
Ok.
Clear.

1039
01:47:17,189 --> 01:47:19,192
Clear again, please.

1040
01:47:22,571 --> 01:47:23,571
Go on.

1041
01:47:23,572 --> 01:47:26,576
Clear, please.

1042
01:47:28,078 --> 01:47:29,078
Yes!

1043
01:47:29,079 --> 01:47:30,079
Oh, yes!

1044
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:31,582
All right.

1045
01:47:34,086 --> 01:47:35,587
Good work.
Good work.

1046
01:47:35,985 --> 01:47:37,987
It's ok?

1047
01:47:55,488 --> 01:47:56,990
Hi, Bess.

1048
01:47:59,493 --> 01:48:00,995
Bess...

1049
01:48:01,996 --> 01:48:05,500
Bess, I think it's time
we had a little chat.

1050
01:48:17,265 --> 01:48:21,270
I love you no matter what is in your head.

1051
01:48:42,881 --> 01:48:44,883
So you didn't have to give Jan...

1052
01:48:44,884 --> 01:48:46,985
...electric shock treatment
when his heart stopped...

1053
01:48:47,086 --> 01:48:48,388
...in the operation yesterday?

1054
01:48:48,889 --> 01:48:49,890
No, we didn't.

1055
01:48:50,391 --> 01:48:52,392
It was a perfectly simple operation.

1056
01:48:52,393 --> 01:48:54,896
As you know.
Well...

1057
01:48:56,774 --> 01:48:58,775
I shouldn't have to say that.

1058
01:48:58,776 --> 01:49:00,278
You know that very well.

1059
01:49:05,285 --> 01:49:08,288
I want a word with Bess on her own.

1060
01:49:13,545 --> 01:49:15,548
Thank you, Dorothy.

1061
01:49:17,049 --> 01:49:20,553
I'm not going to ask you
what you've been getting up to...

1062
01:49:20,554 --> 01:49:23,056
...because I don't want
to hear you lie to me,

1063
01:49:23,057 --> 01:49:26,561
...but as long as you are
living under my roof,

1064
01:49:26,562 --> 01:49:30,065
...you are to behave
like a decent human being.

1065
01:49:30,066 --> 01:49:32,569
I have never lied to you.

1066
01:49:33,070 --> 01:49:34,697
Do you understand me?

1067
01:49:38,702 --> 01:49:40,204
Yes, mother.

1068
01:49:43,708 --> 01:49:46,712
This is very painful for me.

1069
01:49:47,213 --> 01:49:49,214
Your grandfather can no longer

1070
01:49:49,215 --> 01:49:52,218
hold his hand over you with the elders.

1071
01:49:52,219 --> 01:49:55,222
I don't think you realize what that means.

1072
01:49:55,223 --> 01:49:59,728
Have you any idea
what it's like to be cast out?

1073
01:49:59,729 --> 01:50:03,233
You will have nothing, Bess.

1074
01:50:03,734 --> 01:50:05,735
I've known strong men and women...

1075
01:50:05,736 --> 01:50:07,238
...wither away after being cast out.

1076
01:50:07,739 --> 01:50:13,745
Now, you are not strong.
You're a feeble girl.

1077
01:50:13,746 --> 01:50:16,250
It would kill you, Bess.

1078
01:50:17,751 --> 01:50:19,253
I've said enough.

1079
01:50:35,148 --> 01:50:37,150
Bess.
Bess.

1080
01:50:37,151 --> 01:50:40,155
Can you come down a minute, love?

1081
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:45,662
Dr. Richardson is here.

1082
01:50:47,164 --> 01:50:48,666
Hi, Bess.

1083
01:50:50,168 --> 01:50:52,170
Hello.

1084
01:51:02,183 --> 01:51:05,187
How are you?
Can we sit down?

1085
01:51:13,822 --> 01:51:15,324
Bess...

1086
01:51:18,328 --> 01:51:20,330
I think... I think you've got yourself...

1087
01:51:20,331 --> 01:51:21,832
...involved in something...

1088
01:51:21,833 --> 01:51:23,335
...which is out of your control.

1089
01:51:24,836 --> 01:51:27,340
Have I?

1090
01:51:29,342 --> 01:51:31,344
Come on, Bess.

1091
01:51:31,345 --> 01:51:33,847
You're not a kid any more.

1092
01:51:33,848 --> 01:51:35,849
Look, for Christ's sake,

1093
01:51:35,850 --> 01:51:37,352
...he's forcing you to get screwed...

1094
01:51:37,853 --> 01:51:39,354
...by every Tom, Dick, and Harry.

1095
01:51:39,355 --> 01:51:41,357
It's just not you.

1096
01:51:42,734 --> 01:51:45,237
I don't make love with them.

1097
01:51:46,739 --> 01:51:49,242
I make love with Jan...

1098
01:51:50,744 --> 01:51:53,247
...and I save him from dying.

1099
01:51:59,255 --> 01:52:00,756
Well, I'm sorry, but you know,

1100
01:52:00,757 --> 01:52:02,759
To me, he seems more
like a dirty old man...

1101
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:04,762
...who wants to play the peeping Tom.

1102
01:52:08,767 --> 01:52:11,269
Sometimes...

1103
01:52:11,270 --> 01:52:14,274
I don't even have to tell him about it.

1104
01:52:17,779 --> 01:52:20,282
Jan and me...

1105
01:52:20,782 --> 01:52:23,286
We have a spiritual contact.

1106
01:52:30,795 --> 01:52:34,800
God gives everyone something to be good at.

1107
01:52:38,305 --> 01:52:39,807
I've always been stupid...

1108
01:52:42,810 --> 01:52:44,813
But I'm good at this.

1109
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:52,823
God gives everyone a talent.

1110
01:52:57,829 --> 01:52:59,832
And what's Jan's talent?

1111
01:53:06,340 --> 01:53:07,842
He is...

1112
01:53:11,847 --> 01:53:14,851
He's a great lover.

1113
01:53:16,353 --> 01:53:18,856
Well, what's... what's mine, then?

1114
01:53:19,357 --> 01:53:22,359
I don't know.

1115
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:24,363
Haven't you found it yet?

1116
01:53:26,866 --> 01:53:28,368
I see.

1117
01:53:29,870 --> 01:53:33,874
And what's your talent, then, Bess?
Because...

1118
01:53:33,875 --> 01:53:35,877
Surely it can't be being screwed...

1119
01:53:35,878 --> 01:53:37,880
...by men you've never seen before.

1120
01:53:40,383 --> 01:53:42,386
I can believe.

1121
01:53:57,155 --> 01:53:58,655
Are you angry now?

1122
01:53:58,656 --> 01:54:00,157
Yes, I am!

1123
01:54:00,158 --> 01:54:01,658
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm angry...

1124
01:54:01,682 --> 01:54:03,762
...because you can't see that
he's messing you about.

1125
01:54:03,763 --> 01:54:05,164
He's the one who's sick.

1126
01:54:05,265 --> 01:54:07,468
Look, what he's doing to you is sick,

1127
01:54:08,169 --> 01:54:09,669
and it's getting sicker and sicker.

1128
01:54:09,670 --> 01:54:11,672
He's becoming more
and more of a danger to you

1129
01:54:11,673 --> 01:54:14,175
the more the fluid rises in his...

1130
01:54:14,176 --> 01:54:16,178
...listen to me, for god's sake!

1131
01:54:16,179 --> 01:54:18,682
Do you always get so involved...

1132
01:54:19,183 --> 01:54:21,685
...in your patients' problems,
Dr. Richardson?

1133
01:54:21,686 --> 01:54:24,189
Listen to me, Bess.

1134
01:54:24,689 --> 01:54:26,191
I care for you.

1135
01:54:33,701 --> 01:54:35,703
I love you, Bess.

1136
01:54:38,207 --> 01:54:40,209
You're very special.

1137
01:54:47,218 --> 01:54:49,721
Will you move your hands, please?

1138
01:54:50,222 --> 01:54:51,223
Certainly.

1139
01:54:57,731 --> 01:54:59,233
Dodo.

1140
01:55:02,738 --> 01:55:06,241
Will you show Dr. Richardson out, please?

1141
01:55:06,242 --> 01:55:08,245
What's going to happen now, Bess?

1142
01:55:08,745 --> 01:55:10,246
Has he told you any more...

1143
01:55:10,247 --> 01:55:11,748
...of the thoughts he's had?

1144
01:55:11,749 --> 01:55:14,251
Any more services for you to perform?

1145
01:55:14,252 --> 01:55:16,254
Don't come here again.

1146
01:55:16,255 --> 01:55:18,456
He has, has he?
And what's it going to be this time?

1147
01:55:18,758 --> 01:55:20,999
What are you going to give him
to slobber over this time?

1148
01:55:41,996 --> 01:55:46,502
Dear father, what's going on?

1149
01:56:24,550 --> 01:56:27,554
Father, where are you?

1150
01:56:52,335 --> 01:56:53,837
That boy scared me.

1151
01:57:10,233 --> 01:57:12,235
Hello.

1152
01:57:14,738 --> 01:57:17,742
Can you take me out to the ships?

1153
01:57:22,749 --> 01:57:24,750
Can't take you out there.

1154
01:57:24,751 --> 01:57:27,254
The other girls wouldn't like it.

1155
01:57:28,506 --> 01:57:30,507
But they can't do all the ships.

1156
01:57:30,508 --> 01:57:32,010
They don't have time.

1157
01:57:32,386 --> 01:57:33,888
Maybe not.

1158
01:57:35,765 --> 01:57:38,267
What about the big one?

1159
01:57:38,268 --> 01:57:40,770
I don't go out to that one any more.

1160
01:57:40,771 --> 01:57:44,025
Girls won't go aboard.

1161
01:57:44,026 --> 01:57:48,031
Well, then you can take me.
No harm done.

1162
01:57:53,037 --> 01:57:56,540
How are you feeling, Jan?

1163
01:57:56,541 --> 01:58:00,547
Well, I've felt better.

1164
01:58:02,549 --> 01:58:04,050
Yeah.
Yeah.

1165
01:58:04,051 --> 01:58:05,552
Unfortunately, the periods...

1166
01:58:05,553 --> 01:58:08,556
...in which we can get through to you...

1167
01:58:08,557 --> 01:58:10,558
...have lately become very rare.

1168
01:58:10,559 --> 01:58:12,160
I'll have to send you back to Glasgow...

1169
01:58:12,261 --> 01:58:14,064
...for a while, I'm afraid.

1170
01:58:15,816 --> 01:58:18,318
I don't want any more...

1171
01:58:18,319 --> 01:58:20,821
...operations.

1172
01:58:20,822 --> 01:58:23,324
Of course, it's entirely up to you,

1173
01:58:23,325 --> 01:58:25,327
...but...

1174
01:58:25,328 --> 01:58:28,331
I have to say that your
condition's unlikely to improve...

1175
01:58:28,332 --> 01:58:30,835
...without surgery.

1176
01:58:38,344 --> 01:58:43,350
Well, if you've made
your mind up on that point,

1177
01:58:43,351 --> 01:58:46,855
Maybe it's time to consider other matters.

1178
01:58:48,858 --> 01:58:52,487
I mean, we should start thinking
about other people than just you.

1179
01:58:55,992 --> 01:58:57,494
Bess.

1180
01:58:59,496 --> 01:59:03,001
I'm glad you understand
what I'm driving at.

1181
01:59:05,504 --> 01:59:10,510
Your... your condition's been-
it's been very hard on her.

1182
01:59:13,013 --> 01:59:16,016
And I can't judge why,
but she's suffering...

1183
01:59:16,017 --> 01:59:19,522
...from delusions regarding your condition.

1184
01:59:22,025 --> 01:59:24,027
I have to be blunt.

1185
01:59:25,529 --> 01:59:27,532
I don't think that
seeing you is good for her.

1186
01:59:29,534 --> 01:59:31,035
I guess not.

1187
01:59:31,036 --> 01:59:33,538
I am convinced that the best thing

1188
01:59:33,539 --> 01:59:35,542
...we can do for her right now...

1189
01:59:36,043 --> 01:59:38,546
is to admit her again.

1190
01:59:43,177 --> 01:59:45,679
Get her away?

1191
01:59:45,680 --> 01:59:47,182
Yes.

1192
01:59:48,684 --> 01:59:50,686
As far away as possible.

1193
01:59:52,689 --> 01:59:55,191
Think that's necessary?

1194
01:59:55,192 --> 01:59:59,196
Listen, if you don't want surgery,

1195
01:59:59,197 --> 02:00:02,201
...the indications are that we
will enter a prolonged period...

1196
02:00:02,701 --> 02:00:05,261
...in which you will be more and
more affected by your condition.

1197
02:00:07,207 --> 02:00:13,215
The poorlier you are, the more
detrimental your influence on Bess.

1198
02:00:13,715 --> 02:00:17,219
I've drawn up some papers giving
me the authority to detain her...

1199
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:20,224
...under the provisions
of the mental health act.

1200
02:00:22,226 --> 02:00:25,230
I'll need your consent.

1201
02:00:25,731 --> 02:00:28,234
You're going to section Bess?

1202
02:00:28,734 --> 02:00:30,737
It's the only way I can get her treated.

1203
02:00:51,263 --> 02:00:53,265
Tell me, Dr. Richardson, does...

1204
02:00:55,268 --> 02:00:57,771
...does this mean I will
never see her again?

1205
02:01:00,274 --> 02:01:02,277
To be realistic, yes.

1206
02:01:05,781 --> 02:01:07,784
It's just there at the bottom.

1207
02:01:22,427 --> 02:01:24,430
You said you wanted to help her.

1208
02:01:27,434 --> 02:01:29,436
Come on, Jan.

1209
02:01:46,833 --> 02:01:49,837
<i>If you've been bad</i>

1210
02:01:50,338 --> 02:01:53,342
<i>Lord, I bet you have</i>

1211
02:01:54,844 --> 02:01:58,347
<i>And you've not been hit</i>

1212
02:01:58,348 --> 02:02:01,352
<i>You've not been hit
by flying lead</i>

1213
02:02:02,854 --> 02:02:06,357
<i>You'd better
close your eyes</i>

1214
02:02:06,358 --> 02:02:10,363
<i>You'd better
bow your head</i>

1215
02:02:14,368 --> 02:02:18,873
<i>Wait for the ricochet...</i>

1216
02:03:14,695 --> 02:03:16,696
How do I get back?

1217
02:03:16,697 --> 02:03:19,201
I'll keep an eye out for you.

1218
02:03:46,110 --> 02:03:48,112
Hello.

1219
02:03:53,744 --> 02:03:56,748
What do you want?

1220
02:04:04,258 --> 02:04:07,261
I want that you do it
with the sailor and I watch.

1221
02:04:09,765 --> 02:04:11,267
Ok.

1222
02:04:19,777 --> 02:04:20,779
It's all right.

1223
02:04:25,034 --> 02:04:27,286
It's ok.

1224
02:04:27,287 --> 02:04:29,288
All right.
Come here, you.

1225
02:04:29,289 --> 02:04:30,291
No!

1226
02:04:32,168 --> 02:04:33,670
There we go, eh?

1227
02:04:36,173 --> 02:04:38,176
Yeah.
That's better.

1228
02:04:39,177 --> 02:04:42,056
Come on down.

1229
02:04:43,557 --> 02:04:45,059
Yeah.

1230
02:04:45,560 --> 02:04:47,562
You like it like this, eh?

1231
02:04:47,563 --> 02:04:50,065
Oh, please.
Can I go home now?

1232
02:04:50,066 --> 02:04:52,067
No. No.
Can I go home now?

1233
02:04:52,068 --> 02:04:53,429
Please, I don't want...
Stay still.

1234
02:04:53,570 --> 02:04:54,570
No.
Please.

1235
02:04:54,571 --> 02:04:55,572
No. No. Please.
Please.

1236
02:04:55,573 --> 02:04:57,574
Stay still, I said.

1237
02:04:57,575 --> 02:04:59,077
Stay still, I said.

1238
02:05:00,579 --> 02:05:04,083
Stay still, I said.

1239
02:05:08,339 --> 02:05:09,965
No.

1240
02:05:13,470 --> 02:05:14,472
Bitch!

1241
02:05:17,475 --> 02:05:18,476
I'm going to shoot you.

1242
02:05:18,477 --> 02:05:19,979
You will?

1243
02:05:20,479 --> 02:05:21,480
I'm going to shoot you.

1244
02:05:21,481 --> 02:05:23,482
You think so?

1245
02:05:23,483 --> 02:05:25,986
You don't even know how to use that thing.

1246
02:05:34,873 --> 02:05:36,875
Nobody will believe a hooker!

1247
02:05:45,761 --> 02:05:47,763
Because there is only one thing for us,

1248
02:05:47,764 --> 02:05:49,765
...sinners that we are,

1249
02:05:49,766 --> 02:05:53,771
...to achieve perfection
in the eyes of God...

1250
02:05:55,774 --> 02:05:58,277
...through unconditional love...

1251
02:05:58,778 --> 02:06:01,781
...for the word that is written,

1252
02:06:01,782 --> 02:06:05,787
...through unconditional love for the law.

1253
02:06:11,794 --> 02:06:16,300
I don't understand what you're saying.

1254
02:06:18,303 --> 02:06:21,807
How can you love a word?

1255
02:06:23,184 --> 02:06:28,189
Love words.

1256
02:06:28,190 --> 02:06:31,945
You cannot be in love with a word.

1257
02:06:32,946 --> 02:06:37,953
You can love another human being.

1258
02:06:41,457 --> 02:06:43,458
That's perfection.

1259
02:06:43,459 --> 02:06:44,961
No woman speaks here.

1260
02:06:45,337 --> 02:06:47,339
Bess McNeill, the kirk session...

1261
02:06:47,590 --> 02:06:50,593
...has decided this day that henceforth,

1262
02:06:50,594 --> 02:06:53,596
...you shall no longer
have access to this kirk.

1263
02:06:53,597 --> 02:06:56,100
They who know you shall not know you.

1264
02:06:56,101 --> 02:06:57,601
Please, let me stay!
Please!

1265
02:06:57,602 --> 02:07:01,858
Be gone, Bess McNeill,
from the house of God.

1266
02:07:24,637 --> 02:07:27,139
Hello, Bess.

1267
02:07:27,140 --> 02:07:29,141
You're... you're coming with us.

1268
02:07:29,142 --> 02:07:30,643
We're going to Glasgow.

1269
02:07:30,644 --> 02:07:32,145
Bess, they're going to take you...

1270
02:07:32,146 --> 02:07:33,947
...back into hospital
just for a little bit.

1271
02:07:34,048 --> 02:07:35,851
It's for your own good.

1272
02:07:36,151 --> 02:07:39,154
I want to see Jan.
I want to see my husband.

1273
02:07:39,155 --> 02:07:40,657
I know, but not now, Bess.

1274
02:07:41,158 --> 02:07:43,660
It's for your own good, Bess.

1275
02:07:43,661 --> 02:07:45,662
Mother can't have me admitted.

1276
02:07:45,663 --> 02:07:47,164
Not now that I'm married.

1277
02:07:47,165 --> 02:07:51,169
Bess, it wasn't mother
that signed the paper.

1278
02:07:51,170 --> 02:07:53,173
It was Jan.

1279
02:07:54,675 --> 02:07:55,676
You liar!

1280
02:07:56,177 --> 02:07:57,678
Come along, Bess.

1281
02:07:57,679 --> 02:07:59,179
Jan!

1282
02:07:59,180 --> 02:08:01,684
Jan!

1283
02:08:02,184 --> 02:08:04,686
Dodo, how can you do this?

1284
02:08:04,687 --> 02:08:07,190
You had a husband, too, once.

1285
02:08:07,191 --> 02:08:10,695
Your love could have saved him,
if only you'd tried!

1286
02:08:11,196 --> 02:08:12,197
Jan!

1287
02:08:14,450 --> 02:08:15,451
Jan!

1288
02:08:48,910 --> 02:08:51,913
Ok, Bess.
Let's go.

1289
02:08:51,914 --> 02:08:54,917
Oh, fuck!

1290
02:08:54,918 --> 02:08:57,421
Ryan, she's not here!

1291
02:09:09,937 --> 02:09:11,439
Hello.

1292
02:09:25,331 --> 02:09:26,833
Who's a tart?

1293
02:09:30,713 --> 02:09:32,716
What are you doing?

1294
02:09:47,234 --> 02:09:48,735
Who's a tart?

1295
02:09:48,736 --> 02:09:49,736
Who's a tart?

1296
02:09:49,737 --> 02:09:50,989
Tart!
Tart!

1297
02:10:02,378 --> 02:10:04,882
I can't open the door.

1298
02:10:06,383 --> 02:10:07,385
Mother?

1299
02:10:09,888 --> 02:10:15,395
Please.
Please, mother, open the door!

1300
02:10:16,897 --> 02:10:19,901
Please, open the door!

1301
02:10:22,904 --> 02:10:25,407
Mother!

1302
02:10:25,408 --> 02:10:29,412
I'll be good.
I'll be really, really good.

1303
02:10:29,413 --> 02:10:33,418
I'll be really good.
Oh, please, open.

1304
02:10:54,194 --> 02:10:55,696
Please go away.

1305
02:10:58,199 --> 02:11:00,701
Stop it!
Go away.

1306
02:11:00,702 --> 02:11:03,831
You just go away and leave me!

1307
02:11:21,854 --> 02:11:22,855
Who's a tart?

1308
02:11:40,753 --> 02:11:42,254
Away with you.

1309
02:11:42,255 --> 02:11:45,259
Stop all this racket
outside the house of God.

1310
02:11:46,761 --> 02:11:49,264
Come on!
On you go.

1311
02:12:36,490 --> 02:12:37,992
What's happened?

1312
02:12:38,994 --> 02:12:40,494
Bess.

1313
02:12:40,495 --> 02:12:42,497
Bess!

1314
02:12:42,498 --> 02:12:45,501
Bess, are you all right, love?

1315
02:12:45,502 --> 02:12:48,505
Bess, it's Dodo.

1316
02:12:48,506 --> 02:12:50,508
Oh, Bessie.

1317
02:13:07,530 --> 02:13:09,532
Jan is dying.

1318
02:13:12,536 --> 02:13:15,039
I wasn't to tell you.

1319
02:13:21,047 --> 02:13:23,048
I wasn't to tell you.

1320
02:13:23,049 --> 02:13:27,055
No.
It's good you told me.

1321
02:13:36,567 --> 02:13:38,068
I know you love me.

1322
02:13:50,584 --> 02:13:52,587
I have to go.

1323
02:13:55,591 --> 02:13:58,594
Is there anything I can do for you?

1324
02:13:58,595 --> 02:14:00,096
Anything at all?

1325
02:14:05,603 --> 02:14:07,605
Yes.

1326
02:14:07,606 --> 02:14:09,607
I'd like you to go to Jan...

1327
02:14:09,608 --> 02:14:11,109
...and pray for him to be cured...

1328
02:14:11,110 --> 02:14:13,614
...and to rise from his bed and walk.

1329
02:14:38,896 --> 02:14:41,398
Will you take me to the big ship?

1330
02:14:41,399 --> 02:14:42,900
Again?

1331
02:14:42,901 --> 02:14:44,403
Are you sure?

1332
02:14:56,418 --> 02:14:58,921
Father, why aren't you with me?

1333
02:15:09,059 --> 02:15:13,565
I am with you, Bess.
What do you want from me?

1334
02:15:18,070 --> 02:15:20,073
Where were you?

1335
02:15:21,575 --> 02:15:24,579
Don't you think I have other people...

1336
02:15:25,039 --> 02:15:26,079
...who want to talk to me?

1337
02:15:26,080 --> 02:15:31,087
Well, of course.
I hadn't thought of that.

1338
02:15:32,589 --> 02:15:35,591
There's this silly
little thing called Bess...

1339
02:15:35,592 --> 02:15:37,595
...who keeps on wanting me
to talk to her,

1340
02:15:38,096 --> 02:15:41,600
...so my work's been piling up a bit.

1341
02:15:43,603 --> 02:15:46,106
But you're with me now?

1342
02:15:48,108 --> 02:15:52,614
Of course I am, Bess.
You know that.

1343
02:16:02,126 --> 02:16:04,129
Thank you.

1344
02:16:43,345 --> 02:16:45,348
I'm sorry.
Do you need me?

1345
02:16:45,848 --> 02:16:47,851
No. That's all right.
Stay there.

1346
02:16:49,853 --> 02:16:52,355
Bess asked me to pray.

1347
02:16:52,356 --> 02:16:54,358
For what?

1348
02:16:54,359 --> 02:16:55,861
For Jan's life.

1349
02:16:58,865 --> 02:17:01,368
For a miracle.

1350
02:17:03,370 --> 02:17:06,875
Yeah.
That would be a miracle.

1351
02:17:17,764 --> 02:17:19,766
Dear God,

1352
02:17:20,267 --> 02:17:22,519
I pray that Jan gets better,

1353
02:17:22,520 --> 02:17:26,483
That he rises from his bed and walks.

1354
02:17:39,041 --> 02:17:41,043
Sister McNeill here.

1355
02:17:43,046 --> 02:17:45,798
We'll make you better.

1356
02:17:45,799 --> 02:17:48,301
Where's Jan?
I'd like to see him.

1357
02:17:48,302 --> 02:17:49,803
No.
Not now, love.

1358
02:17:49,804 --> 02:17:51,405
You're going to have an operation now.

1359
02:17:51,506 --> 02:17:52,908
I want to see him.

1360
02:17:53,309 --> 02:17:54,749
Not now, love.
You need an operation.

1361
02:17:54,811 --> 02:17:57,314
No.
I've got to see Jan.

1362
02:17:57,814 --> 02:17:59,817
Please, Dodo.

1363
02:18:00,318 --> 02:18:01,568
All right.

1364
02:18:01,569 --> 02:18:03,571
All right. Stop.
She wants to see Jan.

1365
02:18:03,572 --> 02:18:05,573
I'm going to take her to see Jan.

1366
02:18:05,574 --> 02:18:08,076
Come on.
Out of the way, for God's sake.

1367
02:18:08,077 --> 02:18:11,080
Help me.
Come on.

1368
02:18:11,081 --> 02:18:13,584
Move, for Christ's sake!

1369
02:18:14,586 --> 02:18:16,588
All right.
All right.

1370
02:18:17,089 --> 02:18:19,591
There you go.
There you are.

1371
02:18:19,592 --> 02:18:21,595
You can see him now, can't you?

1372
02:18:22,095 --> 02:18:23,597
How is he...

1373
02:18:25,099 --> 02:18:27,102
How's he doing?

1374
02:18:31,357 --> 02:18:34,235
Is he not any better?

1375
02:18:34,236 --> 02:18:36,738
No.
No, he's not.

1376
02:18:36,739 --> 02:18:42,246
I thought he might be better now.

1377
02:18:47,252 --> 02:18:50,757
Maybe I was wrong after all.

1378
02:18:54,261 --> 02:18:56,764
Ok, let's get inside.

1379
02:19:00,269 --> 02:19:01,770
Here.
Take those.

1380
02:19:01,771 --> 02:19:02,771
Tape.

1381
02:19:02,772 --> 02:19:07,777
Ok, take care. Let's go.
1, 2, 3.

1382
02:19:07,778 --> 02:19:09,781
There we go.

1383
02:19:17,791 --> 02:19:19,292
It's all right, love.

1384
02:19:19,293 --> 02:19:20,794
Now, Bess, do you know me?

1385
02:19:20,795 --> 02:19:21,795
Yeah.

1386
02:19:21,796 --> 02:19:23,298
Pulse 90.

1387
02:19:28,805 --> 02:19:30,306
What happened?
Do you know?

1388
02:19:30,307 --> 02:19:31,307
No.

1389
02:19:31,308 --> 02:19:34,311
Pressure on 100.

1390
02:19:34,312 --> 02:19:35,312
Get the blood pressure.

1391
02:19:35,313 --> 02:19:36,814
100.

1392
02:19:36,815 --> 02:19:37,896
It will be all right, love.

1393
02:19:38,317 --> 02:19:39,317
It will be all right.

1394
02:19:39,318 --> 02:19:40,694
Can I have a look at her back?

1395
02:19:40,695 --> 02:19:42,696
There we go.

1396
02:19:42,697 --> 02:19:44,699
Ok.
Hand me the scissors.

1397
02:19:44,700 --> 02:19:45,700
Yes.

1398
02:19:45,701 --> 02:19:46,702
All right.

1399
02:19:46,703 --> 02:19:48,705
Mother.

1400
02:19:49,206 --> 02:19:51,208
Oh, mother.

1401
02:19:53,211 --> 02:19:54,212
Here she is.

1402
02:19:55,714 --> 02:19:58,717
Bessie.

1403
02:19:58,718 --> 02:20:00,719
Bess.

1404
02:20:00,720 --> 02:20:03,973
I'm sorry that I could not be good, mother.

1405
02:20:03,974 --> 02:20:06,478
That's all right, Bessie.

1406
02:20:10,983 --> 02:20:14,988
Your grandfather's
sorry he couldn't come.

1407
02:20:18,493 --> 02:20:21,997
Will you tell him that I love him?

1408
02:20:25,627 --> 02:20:29,632
I am glad that you came, mother.

1409
02:20:32,636 --> 02:20:33,636
Blood pressure.

1410
02:20:33,637 --> 02:20:35,639
It will be all right.

1411
02:20:35,640 --> 02:20:37,140
It's going down.

1412
02:20:37,141 --> 02:20:38,643
2 units now.
2 units immediately.

1413
02:20:39,144 --> 02:20:40,144
2 units.

1414
02:20:40,145 --> 02:20:41,746
Ok, we're just going to lower you down

1415
02:20:41,747 --> 02:20:44,050
a little bit now, all right, Bess?

1416
02:20:44,651 --> 02:20:46,152
There we go.

1417
02:20:46,153 --> 02:20:47,279
That was easy, wasn't it?

1418
02:20:47,780 --> 02:20:49,031
Going to be all right.

1419
02:20:49,032 --> 02:20:54,037
Dodo, hold me.

1420
02:20:54,038 --> 02:20:56,039
Here I am.
I'm holding.

1421
02:20:56,040 --> 02:20:58,042
It's all right, love.
I'm here. I'm here.

1422
02:20:58,043 --> 02:21:00,045
I'm afraid.

1423
02:21:00,046 --> 02:21:02,549
I know.
I know.

1424
02:21:04,927 --> 02:21:06,429
Jan?

1425
02:21:08,932 --> 02:21:10,433
Jan!

1426
02:21:10,434 --> 02:21:12,936
Now...

1427
02:21:12,937 --> 02:21:15,439
I'm frightened.

1428
02:21:15,440 --> 02:21:20,947
It's...
It's all wrong.

1429
02:21:22,950 --> 02:21:24,450
No pulse.

1430
02:21:24,451 --> 02:21:25,452
Bess?

1431
02:21:25,453 --> 02:21:26,955
Stand clear.
Stand clear!

1432
02:21:27,330 --> 02:21:28,831
Clear.
Clear.

1433
02:21:28,832 --> 02:21:30,584
What?

1434
02:21:37,593 --> 02:21:39,846
It's going to be all right.

1435
02:21:48,232 --> 02:21:50,735
That's a good girl.
Come on.

1436
02:21:53,989 --> 02:21:55,490
Ok.
You can stop now.

1437
02:21:55,491 --> 02:21:56,992
What? What?
What do you mean?

1438
02:21:56,993 --> 02:21:58,495
She's gone, Dodo.
She's gone.

1439
02:22:03,501 --> 02:22:04,501
No.

1440
02:22:04,502 --> 02:22:06,004
She's gone.

1441
02:22:08,007 --> 02:22:12,012
Bess.
Bess, listen to me.

1442
02:22:16,017 --> 02:22:17,519
I'm sorry.

1443
02:22:22,525 --> 02:22:24,528
I'm sorry.

1444
02:22:25,028 --> 02:22:26,030
Dodo.

1445
02:22:28,032 --> 02:22:31,536
No!

1446
02:22:31,537 --> 02:22:33,539
Come on, Dodo.
Let's go!

1447
02:22:34,540 --> 02:22:36,042
Come on.

1448
02:22:40,047 --> 02:22:42,050
I'm sorry!

1449
02:22:43,475 --> 02:22:45,875
<i>It's a god-awful small affair</i>

1450
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:51,000
<i>To the girl with the mousy hair</i>

1451
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,400
<i>But her mummy is yelling "No"</i>

1452
02:22:55,925 --> 02:22:58,325
<i>And her daddy has told her to go</i>

1453
02:22:59,850 --> 02:23:02,850
<i>But her friend is nowhere to be seen</i>

1454
02:23:03,875 --> 02:23:06,175
<i>Now she walks through her sunken dream</i>

1455
02:23:07,800 --> 02:23:10,000
<i>To the seat with the clearest view</i>

1456
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,300
<i>And she's hooked to the silver screen</i>

1457
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,300
<i>But the film is a saddening bore</i>

1458
02:23:19,825 --> 02:23:22,125
<i>'Cause she's lived it ten times or more</i>

1459
02:23:23,350 --> 02:23:26,350
<i>She could spit in the eyes of fools</i>

1460
02:23:27,475 --> 02:23:29,975
<i>As they ask her to focus on</i>

1461
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:34,000
<i>Sailors fighting in the dance hall</i>

1462
02:23:34,325 --> 02:23:39,025
<i>Oh man!
Look at those cavemen go</i>

1463
02:23:40,300 --> 02:23:43,300
<i>It's the freakiest show</i>

1464
02:23:44,125 --> 02:23:47,225
<i>Take a look at the Lawman</i>

1465
02:23:47,450 --> 02:23:50,450
<i>Beating up the wrong guy</i>

1466
02:23:50,675 --> 02:23:53,675
<i>Oh man!
Wonder if he'll ever know</i>

1467
02:23:55,300 --> 02:23:58,700
<i>He's in the best selling show</i>

1468
02:23:59,325 --> 02:24:04,325
<i>Is there life on Mars?</i>

1469
02:24:06,323 --> 02:24:12,331
You describe the deceased as
"an immature, unstable person,

1470
02:24:12,832 --> 02:24:16,336
...a person who, due to the
trauma of her husband's illness,

1471
02:24:16,837 --> 02:24:18,838
...gave way in obsessive fashion...

1472
02:24:18,839 --> 02:24:23,345
...to an exaggerated,
perverse form of sexuality."

1473
02:24:25,848 --> 02:24:29,352
Would you like to clarify
that to the inquiry?

1474
02:24:29,353 --> 02:24:31,355
That's what I wrote.

1475
02:24:34,860 --> 02:24:38,364
Yes.
That's what it says.

1476
02:24:40,367 --> 02:24:42,368
Can I have a glass of water, please?

1477
02:24:42,369 --> 02:24:45,874
Get Dr. Richardson a glass of water.

1478
02:24:50,379 --> 02:24:51,881
Thank you.

1479
02:24:53,383 --> 02:24:58,389
Listen, man, you had
the deceased in your care.

1480
02:24:58,765 --> 02:25:02,269
The court would like
to hear the medical facts.

1481
02:25:05,774 --> 02:25:09,277
If you'd... if you were to ask me again...

1482
02:25:09,278 --> 02:25:14,785
...to write... the conclusion, then...

1483
02:25:17,789 --> 02:25:20,291
...instead of writing "neurotic"...

1484
02:25:20,292 --> 02:25:24,798
...or, "psychotic," then I might...

1485
02:25:26,300 --> 02:25:29,304
...just, use a word like...

1486
02:25:32,307 --> 02:25:33,809
"Good."

1487
02:25:37,814 --> 02:25:39,316
Good?

1488
02:25:40,318 --> 02:25:41,319
Yes.

1489
02:25:44,323 --> 02:25:48,327
You wish the records of this court...

1490
02:25:48,328 --> 02:25:52,332
...to state that in your medical opinion,

1491
02:25:52,333 --> 02:25:55,337
...the deceased was suffering
from being "good"?

1492
02:25:58,841 --> 02:26:02,345
Perhaps this was
the psychological defect...

1493
02:26:02,846 --> 02:26:04,348
...that led to her death.

1494
02:26:06,351 --> 02:26:08,854
Is that what we shall write,
Dr. Richardson?

1495
02:26:13,359 --> 02:26:14,860
No.

1496
02:26:14,861 --> 02:26:16,864
Of course not.

1497
02:26:18,366 --> 02:26:20,868
Very well, then.

1498
02:26:20,869 --> 02:26:25,374
Perhaps we should stick to your
original statement then, doctor.

1499
02:26:25,375 --> 02:26:26,877
Yes.

1500
02:26:30,381 --> 02:26:33,260
I think that everything there is to say...

1501
02:26:33,760 --> 02:26:36,262
...about Bess McNeill
has been said already.

1502
02:26:36,263 --> 02:26:40,268
We have agreed to sanction her burial,

1503
02:26:40,269 --> 02:26:44,274
...but there can be no funeral service.

1504
02:26:44,649 --> 02:26:47,652
The fact that some of us
knew the deceased girl well...

1505
02:26:47,653 --> 02:26:54,160
...cannot be allowed to
influence the form of her burial.

1506
02:26:54,161 --> 02:26:57,164
Bess McNeill's funeral must be the same...

1507
02:26:57,165 --> 02:27:00,668
...as anyone else of her kind.

1508
02:27:00,669 --> 02:27:05,175
The body will be released by
the authorities sometime this week.

1509
02:27:07,929 --> 02:27:11,433
I've obtained permission from
the elders to bury Bess...

1510
02:27:12,935 --> 02:27:19,443
but... I cannot deviate from the principles
that apply to funerals here.

1511
02:27:22,322 --> 02:27:25,326
I must say about Bess what must be said.

1512
02:28:01,204 --> 02:28:02,706
Ok.
Come on.

1513
02:28:29,866 --> 02:28:33,370
Where's Jan?
Has he gone down there yet?

1514
02:28:33,871 --> 02:28:35,373
I don't know.

1515
02:28:40,504 --> 02:28:42,507
Have you seen Jan?

1516
02:29:08,915 --> 02:29:13,420
Bess McNeill, you are a sinner,

1517
02:29:13,421 --> 02:29:17,927
...and for your sins,
you are consigned to hell.

1518
02:29:20,430 --> 02:29:23,433
Not one of you has the right...

1519
02:29:23,434 --> 02:29:25,937
...to consign Bess to hell.

1520
02:30:15,875 --> 02:30:19,380
Terry, it's time.

1521
02:30:25,387 --> 02:30:26,889
Let's do it.

1522
02:30:31,896 --> 02:30:33,898
Get up, for Christ's sake.

1523
02:31:25,088 --> 02:31:27,091
Come on, man.

1524
02:31:31,596 --> 02:31:33,098
Come on.

1525
02:32:11,647 --> 02:32:13,650
Take good care of her.

1526
02:32:31,172 --> 02:32:34,176
Come on, Jan.
You got to let her go.

1527
02:32:55,953 --> 02:32:57,455
Bess!

1528
02:33:00,709 --> 02:33:03,211
Jan.

1529
02:33:03,212 --> 02:33:04,713
Jan, hey.

1530
02:33:04,714 --> 02:33:06,215
What?
What's the matter?

1531
02:33:06,216 --> 02:33:07,216
Come on.
Come on.

1532
02:33:07,217 --> 02:33:08,718
I want to show you something.

1533
02:33:08,719 --> 02:33:10,721
You're not going to believe it.

1534
02:33:10,722 --> 02:33:11,722
What?

1535
02:33:11,723 --> 02:33:12,723
Come on.

1536
02:33:12,724 --> 02:33:14,225
Please.

1537
02:33:14,226 --> 02:33:15,728
Here.
Let's go.

1538
02:33:16,229 --> 02:33:18,731
Pim!
Pim, come on!

1539
02:33:18,732 --> 02:33:20,734
You're not going to believe it.

1540
02:33:24,239 --> 02:33:26,742
Hey, Pim, Come on.
Check this out.

1541
02:33:29,746 --> 02:33:32,248
Check this thing out, man.

1542
02:33:32,249 --> 02:33:34,751
You see anything?

1543
02:33:34,752 --> 02:33:36,754
There's nothing out there.

1544
02:33:36,755 --> 02:33:38,756
I've tried all the fucking ranges,

1545
02:33:38,757 --> 02:33:40,759
...and there's nothing there.

1546
02:33:40,760 --> 02:33:42,262
I just wanted to be sure.
Come on.
