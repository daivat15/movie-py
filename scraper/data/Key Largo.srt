1
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,850
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Ben.

2
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,050
What gives?

3
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,600
We're looking for a couple of Indians
broke out of jail.

4
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,300
Young bucks in fancy shirts.

5
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,150
If you see anything of them,
telephone my office at Palm Grove.

6
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,730
Okay.

7
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,900
Those Indians they're looking
for must be from around here.

8
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,830
- They always head for home.
- Home being Key Largo.

9
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,700
Want something, Jack?

10
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,120
- Mr. Temple around?
- He ain't here.

11
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,420
Hotel is closed.

12
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,450
- When will he be back?
- I don't know.

13
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,020
Have a beer?

14
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,810
- The bar is closed.
- That's right.

15
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,770
I told you, didn't I? Hotel's closed.

16
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,190
In the summertime, everything's closed.

17
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,650
Give him a drink.

18
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,530
Give him a drink!

19
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,160
You heard me! Give him a drink!

20
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,750
- You said beer?
- Mmm-hmm.

21
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,040
Thank you.

22
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,090
Think nothing of it.

23
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,250
Bargain Lass on the outside
is running very fast and very hard.

24
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,800
It's Lady Bountiful,
they haven't caught her yet.

25
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,600
Come on, Lady Bountiful.

26
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,380
Come on, Lady Bountiful!

27
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,680
Come on!

28
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,600
Lady Bountiful by three lengths.

29
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:12,770
How's that for picking them?

30
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,690
Can I pick them or can't I?

31
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,850
That's him.

32
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,740
I'll take it up.

33
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,910
If he wants you, he'll send for you.

34
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,920
I like Fancy Free.

35
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,180
Carrying 118 pounds.
That's a lot of weight.

36
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,390
- What do you think?
- Fancy Free.

37
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,720
- You play the ponies?
- No.

38
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,730
- Why not?
- I haven't the money.

39
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,650
Aw. Angel, another beer for the gentleman.

40
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,900
You see, I play the long shots.

41
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,400
Betting on a favorite, what do you win?

42
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,030
When a horse comes in for me,
he pays plenty.

43
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,940
Take Fancy Free,

44
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,160
"Morning Line, 12-1."

45
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,230
Oops, that's ridiculous.

46
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,790
He should be 4-1, even less.

47
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,110
Look at that breeding.

48
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,380
"By Chance Play,
out of Misconstrue by Omaha."

49
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,960
Course, he hasn't won in 11 starts, true.

50
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,510
But he's been twice on the money.

51
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,300
And today he's running
a $3,000 claiming race.

52
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,180
Ought to be a cinch.

53
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,470
Yes?

54
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,760
What's your name?

55
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,430
McCloud. Frank. By John, out of Helen.

56
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:32,930
I'm Miss Dawn.

57
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,480
Miss Gaye Dawn.

58
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,260
You. He wants you.

59
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,770
Uh, please excuse me.

60
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,790
Who's that?

61
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,620
- I don't know.
- What's he want?

62
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,120
Old man Temple.

63
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,170
Look, mister, if you're thinking
of putting up here, the hotel's closed.

64
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,420
- Won't be open for another month.
- What are you doin' here?

65
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,970
- We're guests.
- Yeah, but you just said...

66
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,040
We're here by special arrangement.

67
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,430
I don't plan to stay.
I just wanna see Mr. Temple.

68
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,550
Oh, well, why didn't you say so?

69
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,340
He's out by the boathouse.

70
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,460
- Mr. Temple?
- Yeah?

71
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,620
My name's McCloud. Frank McCloud.

72
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,380
McCloud, huh?

73
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,300
- Well, not Major McCloud?
- Yes, sir.

74
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,510
Nora!

75
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,040
Nora! Nora!

76
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,470
Come here! When did you get here?

77
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,520
A few minutes ago.
I'm on my way to Key West.

78
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,020
Did you come on the bus? I saw it stop.

79
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,560
Hey, Nora!

80
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,900
Hurry up!

81
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,360
Come here!

82
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,610
Look who's here.

83
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,900
This is George's wife.

84
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,610
This is Major Frank McCloud.

85
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,870
How do you do, Mrs. Temple?

86
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,450
Your husband and I were
in the same outfit overseas.

87
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,160
As if she didn't know.

88
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,410
I wrote you a letter, Major, to St. Louis.

89
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,530
It was sent on to Portland,
St. Paul and Memphis,

90
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,330
all those places, before it came back.

91
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,250
- Ever been down here before?
- No, sir.

92
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,080
George was right.

93
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,300
The Keys are different than
anything I've ever seen. And hotter.

94
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,680
Uh, don't look for it to get
any cooler before November.

95
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,760
The thermometer will go down to about 100.

96
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,890
The sand flies and mosquitoes
will disappear.

97
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:42,020
It'll be right livable for about
three months on the Keys.

98
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,570
Except for the tourists.

99
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,320
- That Black Caesar's Rock?
- How'd you know?

100
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,240
For one who's never been here,
I know a lot about these Keys.

101
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,810
They were a favorite subject with George.

102
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,070
He used to dig
for pirate gold right over there.

103
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,170
He never lost hope of finding
Blackbeard's own treasure.

104
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,080
He must've dug 10,000 holes.

105
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,550
- Ever find anything?
- Oh, sure.

106
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,220
Saltwater, every time.

107
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,430
How long you gonna be with us, Major?

108
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,720
- An hour or so.
- An hour?

109
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,560
You can spare more time than that, surely.
We got a lot to talk about.

110
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,260
I'll talk as long as you like, Mr. Temple.

111
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,140
Good, then you'll stay overnight.

112
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,310
He can have George's room.

113
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,680
Yes, Dad.

114
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,360
- May I help you?
- Yeah, if you will, please.

115
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,980
Afternoon, Mrs. Temple.

116
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,030
Mr. Temple.
Any news of the Osceola brothers?

117
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,750
Oh, I'm sorry, Ben.

118
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:44,080
I want you to meet my son's
commanding officer, Major McCloud.

119
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,880
- How do you do?
- Officer Ben Wade. Sawyer.

120
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
How do you do?

121
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,470
If you don't mind, Mr. Temple,
we'd like to have a look around.

122
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,800
Ah, you won't find those Indians,
'cause they ain't here.

123
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,600
Maybe they're in the mangrove swamps.
Maybe.

124
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,020
Or maybe if you wanna go wading,
you might find them. Maybe.

125
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,440
But if I was you,
I'd save myself the trouble.

126
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,690
No doubt they'll give
themselves up before morning.

127
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,990
Well, they sure enough ought to.
That's a fact, Mr. Temple.

128
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,160
'Cause the longer they stay at large,
the tougher it's gonna be on 'em.

129
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,870
Fool Indians.
Thirty days to do and they bust out.

130
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:22,620
Well, 30 days in jail for an Indian
is like 30 years for somebody else.

131
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,960
Anyway, I'd like to have a look around.

132
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,130
Now, look here, Clyde, if Mr. Temple
says they ain't here, they ain't.

133
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,660
His word's good enough for me,
and it ought to be good enough for you.

134
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,010
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Temple.
Come on, Clyde.

135
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,350
Those two brothers and my boy, George,
grew up together.

136
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,060
There's no harm in them.

137
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,890
They just went to Palm Grove
and got a little snootful

138
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,850
and started to take Florida
back for the Indians.

139
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,320
Came mighty near succeeding, too.

140
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,150
I sent word for them to
come in and give themselves up.

141
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:55,450
Not that I'm supposed to know where
they are, you understand.

142
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,370
Oh, Major, I want you to meet
Mr., uh, Mr....

143
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,690
- Bass.
- Garcia.

144
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,870
We've already met.

145
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,210
My son's commanding officer overseas.

146
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,370
Yeah?

147
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,000
They were in the
Italian Campaign together.

148
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,670
- From Salerno to Cassino.
- Yeah.

149
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,720
My boy, George, was killed in Cassino.

150
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,010
Yeah?

151
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,610
What's going on here?

152
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,020
Nothing, Mr. Temple.

153
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,690
What's the matter with her?

154
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,240
- Nora? Nora!
- Yes, Father.

155
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,530
What ails that girl? She hurt?

156
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,080
Case of one too many,
that's all, Mr. Temple.

157
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,000
Now, look here! If you people can't
behave yourselves, you gotta leave.

158
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,830
What did you hit her for?

159
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,750
I'll let you in on something.
She's a lush, the lady.

160
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,130
After she bends the elbow a few times,
she begins to see things,

161
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,830
rats, roaches, snakes, bats, you know.

162
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,930
A sock in the kisser is the only thing
that'll bring her out of it.

163
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,060
Your room's ready, Major.

164
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,940
How long have they been here?

165
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,650
That one, Curly, and the woman
showed up first.

166
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,650
Dad Temple told them
we were closed for the summer,

167
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,780
but he offered to rent
the whole hotel for a week.

168
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,570
It was so much money,
Dad couldn't afford to turn it down.

169
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,020
Mr. Brown and the others arrived
in that big boat four days ago.

170
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,330
Which one is Brown?

171
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,500
He's in number 11. Never comes out
of his room except at night.

172
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,910
What's he like?

173
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,830
He's a lady-killer, or thinks so.

174
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,160
Rich, I guess, from the way the others
jump when he lifts a finger.

175
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,090
Out of season in this heat.

176
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,130
Why would they decide
to sit down on Key Largo?

177
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,140
They'll be leaving here
tonight or tomorrow.

178
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,790
Major?

179
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,730
- Were you with George when he died?
- Yes.

180
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,730
Was he in very much pain?

181
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,650
He never knew what hit him.

182
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,770
I was afraid he might have suffered.

183
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,820
Come down to Dad's room
when you're ready, Major.

184
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,190
Excuse me.

185
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,100
Staying the night, huh?

186
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,900
I'm Curly Hoff.

187
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,110
I heard how you were with
old man Temple's son in Italy.

188
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,980
The kid got it, huh?

189
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,360
Ah, too bad.

190
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,700
I hope you didn't take offense
at the way we handled you downstairs.

191
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,040
You caught Toots and me at a bad time.

192
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,410
We were ready to bite anybody's head off.

193
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,530
Especially a certain blonde's.

194
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,420
Look, five of us. We come down here
for the deep-sea fishing.

195
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,880
All the way from Milwaukee.

196
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:03,180
More than a year, we'd been planning
to come down here and fish our brains out.

197
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,220
So what happens? One guy brings a blonde.

198
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,720
And after we all swore
up and down, no dames!

199
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,850
But he's gotta bring her, this guy.

200
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,480
Well, if she isn't drunk and crying,
she's got a hangover and arguing.

201
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,560
One minute she gets sore at you
and won't talk to you at all.

202
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:20,430
The next she's making a play for you
right in front of the guy.

203
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,030
And he gets sore at us, mind you, not her.

204
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,370
Everything's spoiled,
including our dispositions.

205
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,240
It's cost us all this dough, and for what?

206
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,620
The world's worst time.

207
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,280
Now, I ask you, can you blame us
for getting rude?

208
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,710
- No, I don't blame you.
- How about a little drink, pal?

209
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,250
Not right now, thanks.

210
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,580
Hotel Largo.

211
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,550
Come on, just to show
there's no hard feelings.

212
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,880
No, thank you.

213
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,470
Oh, thank you very much.

214
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,100
- Storm signals are up.
- What does that mean?

215
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,760
Hurricane's on its way.

216
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,430
See what I mean? Hurricanes yet.

217
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,090
Dad's in here, Major.

218
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,650
Sit down, Major.

219
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,150
The war's over, Mr. Temple.
I'm not a Major anymore.

220
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,700
Oh, I know the men that were in it
don't like talking about the war,

221
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,540
and I don't like imposing on you.

222
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,920
But this letter here from the War
Department is the only facts we have.

223
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:21,250
And, well, it leaves us in the dark
about a few things.

224
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,260
I'll tell you everything I know,
Mr. Temple.

225
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,050
Will you, Frank? Will you?

226
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,800
I'd be most grateful.

227
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,960
- Where shall I start?
- Anywhere.

228
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,140
Well, he was a good soldier, Mr. Temple,
from start to finish.

229
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,980
You'd have been proud of him
like every man in his regiment was.

230
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,430
- Were they, Frank?
- And with good reason.

231
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,480
It wasn't just a matter of doing his duty.

232
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,400
He was always looking
for a way to do more.

233
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,200
And finding it.

234
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,780
George was a born hero, Mr. Temple.

235
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,290
He couldn't imagine his death.
Only dishonor.

236
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,910
No, of course not.

237
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,620
It's a wonder he lasted till Cassino.

238
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,540
When you believe like George believed,
maybe dying isn't very important.

239
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,840
Once, outside San Pietro,
George and a couple of others

240
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,140
established a forward observation post.

241
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,170
They got a direct hit,
and the others were killed.

242
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,390
That left it up to George.

243
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,520
For three days and three nights
he stayed awake directing our fire.

244
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,560
Most of that time,
I was on the other end of the line.

245
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,190
To keep himself awake,
he talked into the phone.

246
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,520
Talked and talked.

247
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,730
Most of his talk was about you two.

248
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,740
You'd be surprised how much
I know about you both.

249
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,530
For instance, inside your wedding ring,
Nora, there's an inscription,

250
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,160
"Evermore."

251
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,080
That's right.

252
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,710
And you, Mr. Temple.

253
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,540
Do you remember telling George what
this hollow is above the upper lip?

254
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,340
Before he was born, you said
he knew all the secrets of life and death.

255
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,560
Then at the moment of his birth, an angel
came and put his finger right here.

256
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,260
And sealed his lips.

257
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,060
I remember that. Yup.

258
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,400
He couldn't have been more than seven years
old when I told him that fairy story.

259
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,610
What's it like where he's buried?

260
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,320
Just crosses on a slope.

261
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,450
High up, there's what's left of a church.

262
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,400
You can see a river from where George is.

263
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,500
I'd like to pay a visit to that place.

264
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,750
Yep, I would.

265
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,550
Nora, maybe we'll do just that.

266
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,590
Go to Italy and see
where George is buried.

267
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,970
It belongs to us, don't it?
That plot of ground?

268
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,770
I'm very grateful to you, Frank.

269
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,390
Thank you.

270
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,930
There was a storm warning, Dad.

271
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,360
You better see to the boat, dear.

272
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,320
What brought you down this way, Frank?

273
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,070
I like the sea and thought maybe
I'd like to make my living on it.

274
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,950
- Doing what?
- Doesn't matter. Hand on a fishing boat.

275
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,770
Life on land's become
too complicated for my taste.

276
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,990
What did you do before the war, Frank?

277
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,980
I was circulation manager for a newspaper.

278
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,080
- You never went back to it?
- Yeah, but I couldn't stick it.

279
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,710
I've done lot of things
since I left the paper.

280
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:50,000
Driving taxis, waiting on tables,
anything to make a dollar.

281
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,630
Including day labor.

282
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,220
Getting kind of rough.

283
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,180
Major, this is Mr. Feeney.

284
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,710
- Hi, pal.
- How do you do?

285
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,350
How's your ground tackle off the stern?

286
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,560
Plenty heavy.

287
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:07,360
Then we'd better just double up
on these bowlines.

288
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,190
Where'd you learn about boats?

289
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,910
My first sweetheart was a boat.

290
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:19,950
Hey!

291
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,040
How do you like that boat?

292
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,500
Nice craft. She ought to be away
from those reefs with this blow comin' up.

293
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,080
That so?

294
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,590
Put that on that piling over there.

295
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,830
Charlie!

296
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,920
Charlie Wenoka and his family,
Crawfish Island.

297
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,130
The Wenokas are royalty.
Charlie's a prince of the Seminole nation.

298
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,590
His ancestors go back to the gods.

299
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,260
He sells seashells by the seashore.

300
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,740
Hello, Mama Ochobee.

301
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,670
Every Indian around here is
a descendent of Mama Ochobee.

302
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,630
She admits to being 108 years old.
But she has a son who's 112.

303
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,220
So, we suspect Mama doesn't tell
the truth about her age.

304
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,970
New husband?

305
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,880
Him new husband? No, Mama.
Not new husband.

306
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,980
- Got cigarette?
- What?

307
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,980
- You got cigarette?
- Yeah.

308
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,910
Pretty big blow coming, Mama?

309
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,330
Pretty big.

310
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,880
The Indians always know.
Don't ask me how, but they do.

311
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,660
More will be along. They always come to
us from as far as Matecumbe Key.

312
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:42,180
This one was born in our hotel lobby
during the last big blow, weren't you?

313
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,470
Yes.

314
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,850
Hello, Tom. Hello, John.

315
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,170
- Tom and Johnny Osceola, Frank.
- How are you do?

316
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,760
- How do you do?
- Hello.

317
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,440
We get Mr. Temple message.
We here give ourself up to police.

318
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,150
He thinks it's the best thing.

319
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,220
What Mr. Temple say, we do.

320
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,860
Him good friend to Indian.

321
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:03,160
Why don't you go on over to the hotel?
And Dad'll call Palm Grove.

322
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,530
Thanks, Miss Nora.

323
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,000
Poor fellas, they got into some trouble
and were arrested.

324
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,250
Yes, I know.
Mr. Temple told me about them.

325
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,090
They really trust Dad Temple.
All the Indians.

326
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,180
As far as they're concerned,
he's the United States of America.

327
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,390
You're very happy here, aren't you?

328
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,810
- Very.
- You're never lonely?

329
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,230
Did George tell you?
I met him at a USO dance.

330
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,440
He was lonesome. He wanted company.

331
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,820
I was working at a defense plant.

332
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,810
I knew lots of people,
but I was lonesome, too.

333
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,610
Before George, my life
hadn't made much sense.

334
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,740
I never had much of a home,
and I didn't like what I had.

335
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,120
George...

336
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,870
George gave me roots.

337
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,790
When he went overseas,
I came down here to stay with his father.

338
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,500
And the roots took hold.

339
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,000
Now I'm, I'm like one of those mangroves.

340
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,930
Our local police always get their Indian.

341
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,390
You close the shutters
while I get the oil lamps.

342
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,840
Hey, pal. Getting ready
for the hurricane, eh?

343
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,020
How's about joining me
for that little drink now?

344
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,310
No, thanks.

345
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,470
- You're not a drinking man?
- No, not right now.

346
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:02,780
Hey, Curly.

347
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,610
What all happens in a hurricane?

348
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,320
The wind blows so hard
the ocean gets up on its hind legs

349
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,910
and walks right across the land.

350
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,690
And singing this song,

351
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,120
"Rain, rain go away.
Little Ralphie wants to play."

352
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,990
Isn't that Ben Wade's car?

353
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,210
Nora! Have you seen him?

354
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,840
No, Dad, I haven't.

355
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,510
Here's a good one.

356
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,550
They're snooping around looking
for these two boys, and here they are.

357
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,390
Better go out there and sit
in his car and wait for him.

358
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,500
Or better yet, go and find him.

359
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,190
What's so funny, Toots?

360
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,940
There are two cons in a cell, see?

361
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,480
And one con was trying to sell
the other one a fountain pen.

362
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,900
And he says,
"This pen is guaranteed for life."

363
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:48,650
What's the matter? Don't you get it?

364
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,030
A con.

365
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:51,910
"Guaranteed for life."

366
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,490
We get it, all right.

367
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,540
Have you seen Wade or Sawyer
anywhere around, Frank?

368
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,700
No, sir, I haven't.

369
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,880
- His car's out there in the rain.
- Yes, I know.

370
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,330
It's funny.

371
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,090
How about a drink, everybody?
What'll it be, Miss Temple?

372
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,550
Nothing, thanks.

373
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,170
- How about you, Pop?
- Uh...

374
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,680
He's not supposed to drink anything.

375
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,260
That leaves it up to you, pal.

376
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,170
Another time.

377
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:15,930
What's the matter? Don't you like me?

378
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,230
I'm beginning to think
I got smallpox or something.

379
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,940
Are you still laughin'
at that stinking joke?

380
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,190
Here's another one.

381
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,150
Elevator's busting through a roof, see?

382
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,650
And the elevator boy's saying
to a couple of passengers,

383
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,070
"I told you there was no 11th floor."

384
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,830
Explain it for us, Toots.

385
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,620
Wise guy.

386
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,500
What's the idea of them?

387
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,840
They shut the electricity off,
we still have light.

388
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,970
I hear that a hurricane blows off roofs,

389
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,930
uproots trees and puts
the snatch on people.

390
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,850
And they all go flyin' around
in the sky together. Is that right?

391
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,600
Absolutely.

392
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:01,310
It's raining in on Ben's car.
You better close the windows, Nora.

393
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,890
Ralph, go put up the windows in that car.

394
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,430
What, get caught out in that hurricane?
Not me, brother.

395
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,270
I'll take it.

396
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,450
Don't you answer it.

397
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,290
Yes?

398
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,030
No, Mr. Temple's not here now.

399
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,790
No, she's not here either.

400
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,920
Me?

401
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,800
I'm a guest at the hotel.

402
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,760
No, we haven't seen him.

403
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,300
Give me that phone.

404
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:38,510
Yes. If Sawyer shows up,
I'll have him call you right back.

405
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,520
Easy does it, soldier.

406
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,800
The phone rang, and the girl
started for it and I stopped her.

407
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,900
The soldier wants to get rough,
so we show him our rods.

408
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,190
I'm glad the old man's in a wheelchair.
He'd be lots of trouble.

409
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,530
- Who was on the phone?
- The law.

410
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,490
That means he won't be long.

411
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,740
Then what?

412
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,160
We'll see.

413
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,540
You'd think this rain would
cool things off, but it don't.

414
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,880
- Gonna have a hurricane, are we?
- Yeah, so they say.

415
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,880
I'm not afraid of that gun.

416
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,720
Go ahead! Shoot!

417
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,930
Yeah, I'm not afraid.

418
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,800
Brown!

419
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,690
Hey, you! Brown!

420
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,670
Are you thieves or what? You want money?
Is this a robbery?

421
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,170
That's right, Pop.
We're gonna steal all your towels.

422
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:34,790
That big gun in your hand
makes you look grown-up, you think.

423
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,090
I'll bet you spend hours posing
in front of a mirror holding it.

424
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,830
Trying to look tough.

425
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,930
- Shut up.
- You scum.

426
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,520
Toots...

427
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,140
- Tell him not to call me names.
- Shut up, Toots.

428
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,150
Now, listen.

429
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,730
I don't want any trouble.

430
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,570
With you. With anybody.

431
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,560
Now, how about it? Gonna act sensible?

432
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,450
Why are they pointing those guns at us?

433
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,700
Now, look, Pop. Forget the questions.
What you don't know won't hurt you.

434
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,960
We'll be out of here in a couple of hours.

435
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,540
Try to put up with us that long, huh?

436
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,920
What're we gonna eat tonight, sister?

437
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,300
Pompano, maybe?

438
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,010
Am I to understand we're your prisoners?

439
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:22,510
Well, put it this way, Pop, you're gonna
be my guests for a little while.

440
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,810
You know, back in Chi, in the old days,

441
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:29,260
we used to pay $8 to $10
for an order of pompano.

442
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,810
They used to fly it in,
the way they served it,

443
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,430
done up in a brown paper bag.

444
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:37,860
Got any champagne, miss?

445
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,480
No champagne.

446
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,280
Well, that's too bad.

447
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,330
Champagne and pompano.

448
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,790
They really go together.

449
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,460
This one's coming around.

450
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,670
Still feel tough?

451
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,680
Sawyer.

452
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,850
You won't get away with it, Rocco.

453
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,530
Why'd you hurt that boy?

454
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,790
He's a cop, that's why.

455
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,000
Well, who are you?

456
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,660
Why are you here?

457
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,830
- Answer me!
- Oh, stop hollering, old man.

458
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,300
Johnny Rocco, of course.

459
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,340
Hot water.

460
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,800
Get some.

461
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,850
Yeah, that's right.

462
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,180
Johnny Rocco.

463
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:55,060
- I know that name.
- Sure, Pop. Who doesn't?

464
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:57,440
Johnny Rocco the gangster, Mr. Temple.

465
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,730
The one and only Rocco.

466
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,190
Rocco. Rocco?

467
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,910
What's that, Pop? I'm kind of deaf.

468
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,280
Rocco!

469
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,730
Oh.

470
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,240
He said, "Rocco."

471
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,920
But they threw you out of the country.

472
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,580
Yeah.

473
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,790
Yeah, that's right.

474
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,760
After living in the USA
for more than 30 years,

475
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,260
they... They called me
an undesirable alien.

476
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,430
Me, Johnny Rocco.

477
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,720
Like I was a dirty Red or somethin'.

478
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,630
Then how could you be here?

479
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,100
Well, maybe I'm not, Pop.

480
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,560
This ain't real, what's happenin'.
You're having a dream.

481
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,070
Wake up, Pop. You're snoring.

482
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,650
You're right.

483
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,610
You shouldn't have been deported.

484
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,280
You should've been exterminated.

485
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,120
Rocco...

486
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,870
I must apologize for Mr. Temple.

487
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,460
He doesn't know what he's talking about,
or, who to.

488
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,290
Sir, Johnny Rocco was more than a king.
He was an emperor.

489
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:02,800
His rule extended over beer,
slot machines, the numbers racket,

490
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,630
and a dozen other forbidden enterprises.

491
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,510
He was a master of the fix.

492
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:10,390
Whom he couldn't corrupt, he terrified.
Whom he couldn't terrify, he murdered.

493
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,930
You filth. You city filth.

494
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,190
Oh, Mr. Temple, you're
hopelessly old-fashioned.

495
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,310
Your ideas date back years.

496
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,320
You're still living in the time
when America thought

497
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,480
it could get along
without the Johnny Roccos.

498
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,530
Welcome back, Rocco. It was all a mistake.

499
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,160
America's sorry for what it did to you.

500
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,700
On the level, boss, were you that big?

501
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,740
On the level, are you that dumb?

502
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,610
Yeah.

503
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,870
Yeah, that's me.

504
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,170
Sure, I was all of those things.

505
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,000
And more.

506
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,670
When Rocco talked,
everybody shut up and listened.

507
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:48,380
What Rocco said, went.

508
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,340
Nobody was as big as Rocco.

509
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:53,600
It'll be like that again, only more so.

510
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,170
I'll be back up there one of these days.

511
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,930
And then you're gonna
really see something.

512
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,760
If the time ever comes when your kind

513
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,320
can walk a city street in daylight

514
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,530
with nothing to fear from the people...

515
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,030
The time has come, Mr. Temple. It's here.

516
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,110
Okay.

517
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,940
You know all about me.

518
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,040
Now, what's with you, wise guy?

519
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,250
Well, give.

520
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,420
- In the war, weren't you?
- Yes.

521
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,790
- Get any medals?
- A couple.

522
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,340
- Brave, huh?
- Not very.

523
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,290
- Why'd you stick your neck out?
- No good reason.

524
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,050
What are you saying, Frank?

525
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,050
I believed some words.

526
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:36,010
Words? What words?

527
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,640
Well, they went like this,
"But we are not making all this sacrifice

528
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,730
"of human effort and human lives

529
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,730
"to return to the kind of a world
we had after the last world war."

530
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,110
Huh.

531
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,450
"We're fighting to cleanse
the world of ancient evils.

532
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,540
"Ancient ills."

533
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,840
What's that all about?

534
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,080
I remember those words.

535
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,760
Well, that makes two of us.

536
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:13,590
We rid ourselves of your kind
once and for all.

537
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,390
You ain't comin' back!

538
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,050
Who's gonna stop me, old man?

539
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,890
If I wasn't a cripple...

540
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,690
You wouldn't be talking this way.
Right, Pop?

541
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,230
Filth! You filth!

542
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,440
Get him, will you!

543
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:28,110
- Sic him, Pop!
- Stand your ground!

544
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,270
"Stand your ground."
You're killing me, Pop.

545
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:34,600
Come on. Come on, Pop.
You're not quitting, are you?

546
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,530
My boy, George, never quit,
and I ain't quitting.

547
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,120
That's the spirit, Pop. Never say die.

548
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,760
You little wildcat.

549
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,890
Smelled blood, huh?

550
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,600
Got your appetite up, huh?

551
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,190
Hey, boss.

552
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,640
Miami wants you on the phone.

553
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:29,670
A whole bunch of people out on the porch,
look like Indians.

554
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,340
- What do they want?
- They want in.

555
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,420
- What for?
- The hurricane.

556
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,840
All right, keep them out.

557
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,640
Hello?

558
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,180
Yeah, this is Mr. Brown.

559
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:42,180
Hello? Oh, hello, Ziggy. How are you?

560
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:44,560
I recognized your voice, yeah.

561
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,690
Swell hearin' it again.

562
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,220
How's every little thing?

563
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,270
- Maybe it's the law.
- Right. Show him in.

564
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,030
Hey, that's swell.

565
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,310
This end, too.

566
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,280
Look, when are you coming down?

567
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:02,370
What hurricane? That right?

568
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,250
- I want to see the boss.
- It's the skipper!

569
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,250
- Mr. Temple, Mr. Temple, please!
- Well, look, uh...

570
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,970
You're only a couple of hours away.
You can beat the hurricane out.

571
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,090
No, it's gotta be tonight.

572
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,550
Yeah, see you in a couple of hours.

573
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,260
Bye.

574
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,720
Storm warning. Big blow on the way.

575
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:27,730
- So what?
- This coral reef not safe.

576
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,810
Got to make for deep water right away.

577
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,730
That boat stays right here.

578
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,110
Too dangerous. Boat break up on reef.

579
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,240
I tell you when to move that boat.

580
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,110
I am skipper.

581
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,900
Now, look.

582
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:41,660
I paid you.

583
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,950
- Now, you do what I say.
- Please, señor.

584
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,040
You want half money back? I give.

585
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,500
But got to move boat.

586
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,240
Give me your rod.

587
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,090
See this?

588
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,920
You move that boat,
I'll blow your brains out.

589
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,330
Okay, okay.

590
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,550
We'll be out of here in a couple of hours.

591
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,100
I'll be ready.

592
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,500
Go out and move that car around the back.

593
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,810
I come back here looking
for those Osceola boys.

594
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,020
I knew they were somewhere around here.

595
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,440
Down the lobby,
I ran up against these two.

596
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,860
They didn't look right to me,
so I asked them a few questions.

597
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,990
By the way they answered me,
I knew there was something fishy.

598
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,240
So I put in a call to Ben Wade,

599
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,530
but, before I can get through,
the lights went out on me.

600
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,210
I woke up in there.

601
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,710
Rocco was standing over me.

602
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,780
I recognized him right away
from the pictures.

603
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,800
I made a break for the door,
and the lights went out again.

604
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,580
I'm the electrician.

605
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,350
Angel. Shave.

606
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,360
What did Miami have to say?

607
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,110
Everything's okay.

608
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,320
How soon will they be down?

609
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,490
They were leaving right away.

610
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,900
How're you feeling, copper?

611
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,870
I'll say one thing, you sure can take it.

612
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,000
By the way Toots poured it on,
I'm surprised you ever woke up.

613
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,510
Phew. Boy, sure is hot.

614
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,970
Not too close.

615
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,340
So I won't get away with it, huh?

616
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,220
How many times I heard that
from dumb coppers. I couldn't count.

617
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,590
I still say it.

618
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,350
You'd give your left eye
to nail me, wouldn't you, huh?

619
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,440
You can see the headlines, can't you?

620
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:40,520
"Local Deputy Captures Johnny Rocco."

621
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:43,240
Your picture would be in all the papers.

622
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,160
You might even get to tell on
the newsreel how you pulled it off.

623
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,700
Yeah.

624
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,160
Well, listen, hick.

625
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,370
I was too much for any big-city
police force to handle.

626
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,710
They tried, but they couldn't.

627
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:00,700
Took the United States government
to pin a rap on me.

628
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,620
Yeah, and they won't make it stick!

629
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,510
You hick!

630
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,060
I'll be back pulling strings to get guys
elected mayor and governor

631
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,810
before you ever get 10-buck raise!

632
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,560
Yeah.

633
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,440
How many of those guys in office
owe everything to me?

634
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,560
I made them.

635
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,070
Yeah, I made them, just like a tailor
makes a suit of clothes.

636
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,990
I take a nobody, see, teach him what to
say, get his name in the papers.

637
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,320
I pay for his campaign expenses.

638
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:31,080
Dish out a lot of groceries and coal.

639
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,120
Get my boys to bring the voters out.

640
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,420
And then count the votes,
over and over again

641
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,250
till they added up right,
and he was elected.

642
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,710
Then what happened?

643
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,670
Did he remember when the going got tough?

644
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,180
When the heat was on?

645
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,930
No, he didn't want to.

646
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:51,000
All he wanted was
to save his own dirty neck.

647
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,430
Yeah, that's enough of that.
Give me a towel, will you?

648
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,770
Yeah. "Public Enemy," he calls me!

649
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:01,400
Me, who gave him his public,
all wrapped up with a fancy bow on it!

650
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,150
Angel, lay my clothes out.

651
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,350
- What suit?
- The gray one.

652
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:09,280
- What color shirt?
- A white one, of course.

653
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,410
Some little wildcat.

654
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,880
I knew one like you a long time ago.

655
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,840
Scratched, kicked, bit.

656
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,090
Regular hellion.

657
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,140
She even stuck a knife in me once.

658
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,310
Irish kid.

659
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:37,630
Little and kind of skinny she was
but a real fireball.

660
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,110
Her name was Maggie Mooney.

661
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,900
But for professional reasons,
I had her change it to Gaye Dawn.

662
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,740
She was a knockout in those days.

663
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:16,930
Hold on.

664
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,270
Why, you...

665
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:42,670
Go ahead, boss, smack her.
Get it out of your system.

666
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:48,170
Look at him. The great Johnny Rocco
with Nora's spittle hanging from his face!

667
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,550
Shut up, old man!

668
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,970
Come over here. I'd like to spit on you.

669
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,430
Give me. Give me!

670
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:00,600
Nothing to stop me from
wiping you all out.

671
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:03,760
What good will that do, boss? Forget it.
Her kind's a dime a dozen.

672
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,770
I say smack her and let it go at that.

673
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:08,310
Oh, that'd be right for you, Toots,
not for him.

674
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,740
I need your advice, I ask for it.

675
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,560
The Roccos don't,
or they wouldn't be Roccos.

676
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,740
No, Toots. Smacking her isn't enough
for such an insult. He'd have to kill her.

677
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,740
Then he'd have to kill
the rest of us because we witnessed it.

678
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:23,290
Not just Mr. Temple and me,
but all the witnesses.

679
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:25,540
It's kill us all or nothing.

680
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,090
He needs you and Curly and Angel.

681
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,760
So it'll be nothing.

682
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,590
Wise guy.

683
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,050
Unlock this door!

684
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,770
Unlock this door! I want out!

685
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:42,020
Let her out.

686
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,360
I take off my hat to you, soldier.

687
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,030
It's good thing you said what you did when
you said it, or he'd have started shooting.

688
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:02,080
Close shave for you folks.
Closer than the one he got from Angel.

689
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,960
Where is everybody? Downstairs?

690
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:15,470
Oh... Hello, everybody.

691
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,300
Hi, fella.

692
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,810
Where's Johnny?

693
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:23,730
He's in there getting dressed.

694
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:24,940
I need a drink.

695
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:27,480
What's everybody doing upstairs?

696
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:30,770
Honey?

697
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:33,900
Have you been crying?

698
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,690
Why? Has somebody been mean to you?

699
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,530
Him? Did you make her cry?
If you did, you ought to be ashamed.

700
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:43,160
- How about a little drink, huh?
- No, thanks.

701
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:45,670
- Oh, come on. It'll chase the blues away.
- No.

702
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,670
- I'll have one.
- The boss said...

703
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:50,660
I don't care what the boss said.
I need a drink.

704
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,840
- Good evening, Mr. Temple.
- Miss.

705
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,930
You got a cigarette?

706
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,890
Thanks.

707
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,850
Did your horse win?

708
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,470
- Uh, my horse?
- Mm.

709
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,560
Oh, no, I'm afraid he
ran out of the money.

710
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,880
Oh, I'm sorry.

711
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,530
Oh...

712
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,480
I think I'll go to my room.

713
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:24,690
I feel faint.

714
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:27,460
What I need is a drink.

715
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,710
That's what I need.

716
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:31,420
Say, how about it, you?

717
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:32,880
How many times do I have to tell...

718
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:34,550
The boss say you get no more drink.

719
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:36,040
Oh, he did, did he?

720
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:37,800
Well, this is a free country.

721
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:39,720
If I want a drink, I can have one.

722
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,130
I can buy my own. There!

723
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:44,350
Sorry.

724
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:47,480
- The boss say...
- The boss! The boss! He can go to...

725
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:49,730
Oh, hello, darling.

726
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:52,770
How come it's hotter at night
than in the day?

727
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:55,650
And when it's raining than when it ain't?

728
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,240
Huh, wise guy?

729
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,400
I don't know.

730
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:01,700
You don't know.

731
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:04,160
I thought you knew all the answers.

732
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:07,080
I thought you was a wise guy
from way back.

733
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,250
Darling, you've hurt yourself!

734
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,490
Your face! How in the world...

735
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:17,260
Oh...

736
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,970
- What's funny?
- Nothing.

737
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,800
Then, why'd you laugh?

738
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,390
I don't know.

739
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:26,060
Dumbbell.

740
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,440
What's worse, Curly?

741
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:32,270
A dumbbell or a wise guy?

742
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,230
A wise guy, I guess.

743
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:38,640
Got a million dollars?

744
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:39,860
No.

745
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,440
- How much?
- Nothing.

746
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:43,900
But you're a wise guy.

747
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:48,040
Well, you see, I was educated
only in impractical things.

748
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,650
With you, it's just the opposite.

749
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:54,630
I'm afraid. I hate thunder.

750
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:56,290
Is this it? Is it?

751
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,170
- It's the beginning.
- I'm afraid!

752
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,930
Well, can cars get through
during a hurricane?

753
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:02,890
Maybe. Maybe not.

754
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,140
I think I'll have a...

755
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,680
- A scotch and water, please.
- No.

756
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,850
- Please, darling.
- No!

757
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,980
You know, what you were saying,
that's the truth.

758
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:16,320
Only you don't believe it.
I can see right through you.

759
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,150
What you really think is
"I'm better than Rocco.

760
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:22,530
"He's filth!"
Like the old man said, right?

761
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,700
Right.

762
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:25,660
"He's got a gun, you think,
and I haven't."

763
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:27,160
You figure it's the gun.

764
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:29,700
Well, listen, soldier.

765
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,670
Thousands of guys got guns,
but there's only one Johnny Rocco!

766
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:35,130
How do you account for it?

767
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:36,840
Well, he knows what he wants.

768
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,590
- Don't you, Rocco?
- Sure.

769
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,870
- What's that?
- Tell him, Rocco.

770
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,300
Well, I want, uh...

771
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:46,100
He wants more. Don't you, Rocco?

772
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,130
Yeah, that's it. More.

773
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:49,680
That's right, I want more.

774
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,430
Will you ever get enough?

775
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,180
Will you, Rocco?

776
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,100
Well, I never have.

777
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:56,690
No, I guess I won't.

778
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,530
You, do you know what you want?

779
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,780
Yes, and I had hopes once,
but I gave them up.

780
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,320
Hopes for what?

781
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:07,120
A world in which there's
no place for Johnny Rocco.

782
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:09,400
Yeah?

783
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,040
Okay, soldier.

784
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,880
Here's your chance.

785
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,040
Give me.

786
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:24,090
Okay, soldier, you can make
your hopes come true.

787
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:26,970
But you gotta die for it.

788
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:29,430
See where I'm aiming? Right at your belly.

789
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,890
Go ahead, shoot.

790
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:35,100
- Get away, sister.
- Get away, Nora.

791
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:36,270
Shoot!

792
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,980
All right, you got a gun now.

793
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,400
You gonna use it or not?

794
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:42,150
Kill him, Major!

795
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,110
Yeah, kill him, Major.

796
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:47,240
Go ahead, show them
how you're not afraid to die.

797
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:48,620
Shoot!

798
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,590
Looks like you don't want it enough,
what you want.

799
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:06,130
Tootsy laughs when something's
funny for a change.

800
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,510
One Rocco more or less
isn't worth dying for.

801
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:13,020
Give me that gun.

802
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,930
Oh, no, I'm afraid you'd use it.

803
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,150
One old man more or less
isn't worth dying for.

804
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,010
What's the matter, sister?

805
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:24,770
You look like you lost somebody
near and dear.

806
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:29,450
A live war hero.

807
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:32,440
Now I know how you did it.

808
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:35,870
Hey, Curly, Gaye, anybody!

809
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,040
Want a hero?

810
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:38,790
Here's one for sale, cheap.

811
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,240
All right, Rocco.

812
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:42,840
All right!

813
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:45,960
Let's you and me play that game now!

814
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:49,300
You can stop me from going out that door.

815
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,680
But you gotta die first.

816
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,800
If he shoots me, you still get it.

817
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,180
Get out of my way.

818
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,650
Get away from that door!

819
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:32,630
The gun wasn't loaded.

820
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:36,430
He didn't have a chance.

821
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:39,520
Murderer.

822
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,050
Had to do it, old man.

823
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,400
Or he would've been
out that door and gone.

824
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:46,900
He's gone now.

825
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:50,740
That's right, sister.
The gun wasn't loaded.

826
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:53,190
But our hero didn't know it.

827
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,090
You knew the gun was empty,
didn't you, son?

828
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,210
You could tell by the weight.

829
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,720
No, sir. I didn't know.

830
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:11,510
He just didn't have the nerve, Pop.

831
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,960
Let's face it.

832
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:14,500
You were smart, fella.

833
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,720
What happened to him
would've happened to you.

834
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:19,560
It's better to be a live coward
than a dead hero.

835
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,310
Oh, excuse me.

836
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:26,270
You weren't afraid, son. We all know that.

837
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,980
Oh, yes, I was afraid.

838
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:29,860
But that's not why
I didn't pull the trigger.

839
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:32,820
What do I care about Johnny Rocco,
whether he lives or dies?

840
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:35,070
I only care about me. Me and mine!

841
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,740
Rocco wants to come back to America,
let him. Let him be president!

842
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:41,080
I fight nobody's battles but my own.

843
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:43,450
I can't see it your way, Frank.

844
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,580
Sawyer didn't either.

845
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:46,910
He was a fool.

846
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,090
Me, die to rid the world
of a Johnny Rocco?

847
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:52,550
No, thanks.

848
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:57,180
If I believed your way,
I'd want to be dead, too.

849
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,920
It's true.

850
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,770
You are a coward.

851
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:05,930
What you're saying now is only
to save your coward's face.

852
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,180
Now, Nora.

853
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,110
Maybe Frank's right.

854
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:11,940
Maybe he's right.

855
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:03,330
Okay.

856
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,000
Okay, okay.

857
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:09,460
Hey, what's the idea, Ziggy?
Why ain't you started yet?

858
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:11,920
So what?

859
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,420
Huh?

860
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:16,180
What's the matter, you guys?
Didn't I take chances?

861
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:18,080
Now listen, I make the run from Cuba.

862
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:22,180
I risk my neck, my boat and the shipment,
and you won't come out in the rain?

863
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:25,520
Well, you listen to me. Either you
show tonight or the deal is off.

864
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,970
Well, I know a dozen guys who'd just break
their necks

865
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,680
to get their mitts on this shipment.

866
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:33,030
Look, my watch says 8:00.

867
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:35,780
I give you two hours.
You ain't here by 10:00, the deal is off.

868
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:38,200
Hello?

869
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:40,030
Hello?

870
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,200
Hey!

871
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:45,580
Oh!

872
00:51:57,590 --> 00:51:59,090
Downstairs, everybody.

873
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:31,420
Hey.

874
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:33,750
Didn't I say no drinking?

875
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,340
Oh, please, honey. Just one?

876
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,940
Bring down the shipment.

877
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,610
In there.

878
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:12,250
Mr. Temple.

879
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:13,830
Wait.

880
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:15,840
Is that someone calling?

881
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:19,080
There were some Indians at the door.
I sent them away.

882
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:20,420
You had no right.

883
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:22,470
Oh...

884
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:29,140
Listen to it.

885
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:31,480
"The upstairs shutters gotta be closed,"
she said.

886
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,140
If they ain't, the roof might come off.

887
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:34,650
Go close them.

888
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:49,080
One thing I can't stand
is a dame that's drunk.

889
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:52,160
What I mean, they turn my stomach.

890
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,460
No good to themselves or anybody else.

891
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:00,050
She got the shakes, see?

892
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:01,880
So she has a drink to get rid of them.

893
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:03,680
That one tastes so good
so she has another one.

894
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,840
First thing you know, she's stinko again.

895
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:08,180
You gave me my first drink, Johnny.

896
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:10,350
Oh, so it's all my fault now?

897
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:13,020
Everybody has their first drink,
don't they?

898
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,680
But everybody ain't a lush!

899
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,770
If I'd known you was gonna act this way,
I wouldn't have come here.

900
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,820
If I'd known what you're like,
you wouldn't have been asked.

901
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,280
Eight years since I seen her.

902
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:32,000
You wouldn't know it was the same dame.

903
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:36,040
You certainly haven't changed one bit.

904
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,340
Meaning what?

905
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,210
Nothing.

906
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,300
Gee, honey, you're as mean as can be.

907
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:47,550
Mean as can be.
Now what does that remind me of?

908
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:48,970
Well, don't you remember?

909
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:51,220
That was in a song. She used to sing it.

910
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:52,980
Yeah, that's right.

911
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,100
I gave her her first chance, took her out
of the chorus, made her a singer.

912
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:57,440
Mention that while you're at it.

913
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,390
Why ain't you a singing star
instead of a lush?

914
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:02,730
Gee, Johnny, I didn't mean anything.

915
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,240
Yeah, she could've had a future.

916
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,900
That's right. She had everything.

917
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:08,950
Voice, looks.

918
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,520
Plenty of class.

919
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:12,700
I was the rage.

920
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,080
Gee, honey.

921
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:19,710
Now, look, Gaye.

922
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:22,830
Why don't you give us your old song, hmm?

923
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,890
- You mean, right now?
- Yeah.

924
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:32,600
- I can't.
- Ah, sure you can.

925
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,600
Please, Johnny, don't make me.

926
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:36,770
I won't make you do anything.

927
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:40,770
Tell you what,
I got a proposition for you.

928
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,110
Now, you sing us your song,
you can have a drink.

929
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,530
Can I have the drink first?

930
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,120
No! The song.

931
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,660
Then the drink.

932
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:56,460
Without any accompaniment?

933
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,790
Now, look, do you want a drink
or don't you?

934
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,290
All right.

935
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:16,430
Well?

936
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:18,480
My gowns were gorgeous.

937
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,680
Always low-cut. Very décolleté.

938
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:24,690
I wore hardly any makeup.

939
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:27,270
Just some lipstick, that's all.

940
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:30,490
No lights, just a baby spot.

941
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:32,950
I wouldn't have any entrance.

942
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,660
They'd play the intro in the dark

943
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:39,120
and a spot would come on and there I'd be.

944
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,340
Well, go ahead. Sing.

945
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:34,780
Oh.

946
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:37,620
- Give me that drink now, Johnny.
- No.

947
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,870
- Johnny.
- No!

948
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,620
- But you promised.
- So what?

949
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,580
- You said that...
- But you were rotten.

950
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:49,960
Oh, no.

951
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:35,720
Thanks, fella.

952
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:41,720
You're welcome.

953
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:02,690
- Play a little gin?
- Okay.

954
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:04,240
- For how much?
- You name it.

955
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:05,700
Nickel a point.

956
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:28,980
Hey, old man.

957
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:31,440
How bad can it get?

958
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:34,980
I asked you a question! Did you hear me?

959
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:40,200
Well, worst storm we ever had
was back in '35.

960
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:45,370
Wind whipped up a big wave and sent it
busting right over Matecumbe Key.

961
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:49,330
Eight hundred people
were washed out to sea.

962
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,210
How far away was that from here?

963
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:54,040
A few miles.

964
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,640
Listen to it.

965
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,910
I'm sorry about the things
I said upstairs.

966
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:25,230
I know they aren't true.
Will you forgive me, Frank?

967
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:26,620
Of course.

968
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:29,960
He might've killed you, but that made
no difference, you had to help her.

969
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:33,070
Your head said one way,
but your whole life said another.

970
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:37,120
The other things, maybe they're true.
Maybe it is a rotten world.

971
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:40,260
But a cause isn't lost as long as
someone's is willing to go on fighting.

972
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:42,250
Well, I'm not that someone.

973
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:45,010
But you are.

974
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:47,640
You may not want to be,
but you can't help yourself.

975
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:49,470
Your whole life's against you.

976
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,310
What do you know about my life?

977
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,810
A whole lot.

978
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:58,400
From the way you look and talk,
and from things George wrote me.

979
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:02,700
Most of his last letter was
all about you and him on the phone.

980
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:05,660
Only he had it the other way.
You were the one on the hill.

981
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,250
What's the matter with you?

982
01:02:57,830 --> 01:02:58,870
Nothing.

983
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:03,470
Why is everybody so quiet?

984
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:06,510
Come on, talk, why don't you?

985
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:08,470
Well?

986
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:10,310
You, Curly, say something.

987
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:13,340
- What do you want me to say?
- Oh, anything, just so it's talk.

988
01:03:13,930 --> 01:03:16,260
- Go ahead!
- I'm trying to think.

989
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:20,320
I bet you two or three years,
we get Prohibition back.

990
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,530
Go on.

991
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:24,110
- This time we make it stick.
- Yeah.

992
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:27,480
I bet you two or three years,
Prohibition comes back.

993
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:29,270
Absolutely, yeah.

994
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:34,330
The trouble was, see before, I mean,
too many guys wanted to be top dog.

995
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:36,790
That was the trouble, yeah.

996
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:39,710
One mob gets to massacring another.

997
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:42,380
The papers play it up big. Big, see?

998
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:44,300
- So what happens?
- So what?

999
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:46,420
Naturally, the papers play it up big,

1000
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:49,430
and the public, they get the idea
that Prohibition's no good.

1001
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:52,810
That if they can get rid of it.

1002
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:55,270
- Prohibition, I mean...
- I don't believe it.

1003
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:58,300
Eight hundred guys getting washed
out to sea. You're a liar!

1004
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,400
Nobody would live here
after a thing like that happened.

1005
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:01,650
Would they, Curly?

1006
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:03,820
I remember reading about it
in the papers at the time.

1007
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:06,780
A relief train was dispatched from Miami.

1008
01:04:07,070 --> 01:04:10,320
The barometer was down to about 26 inches

1009
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:13,450
when that train pulled into Homestead.

1010
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:16,500
Engineer backed his string
of empty coaches

1011
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:19,460
into the danger zone
and the hurricane hit.

1012
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:23,920
Knocked those coaches right off the track.

1013
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:28,430
200 miles an hour, that wind blew.

1014
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:34,390
A tidal wave, 12 feet high
went right across the Key.

1015
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:36,470
Whole towns were wiped out.

1016
01:04:36,970 --> 01:04:41,140
Miles and miles of track
were ripped up and washed away.

1017
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:42,560
Nothing was left.

1018
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:47,430
More than 500 bodies were
recovered after the storm.

1019
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,160
And for months afterwards,

1020
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:53,700
corpses were found in the mangrove swamps.

1021
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,080
You don't like it, do you, Rocco?
The storm?

1022
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:03,410
Show it your gun, why don't you?

1023
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,340
If it doesn't stop, shoot it.

1024
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:13,550
So the public votes out Prohibition.

1025
01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:15,850
And that's the end of the mobs.

1026
01:05:16,510 --> 01:05:17,960
Next time, it'll be different, though.

1027
01:05:18,350 --> 01:05:19,940
We learned our lesson, all right.

1028
01:05:20,810 --> 01:05:22,900
Next time, the mobs'll get together.

1029
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:28,180
Make a big wave.

1030
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,690
Send it crashing down on us.

1031
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:34,070
Destroy us all, if need be.
But punish him.

1032
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,480
Oh, shut up, old man!
I'm warning you, shut up!

1033
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:38,410
Hear me. Hear me.

1034
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:39,790
- I'll kill you!
- Rocco!

1035
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:41,150
Make a big wave.

1036
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:45,000
Send it against us. Take us all.
But destroy him.

1037
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:46,630
Rocco.

1038
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:56,320
Mr. Temple!

1039
01:07:09,210 --> 01:07:10,630
Mr. Temple!

1040
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:05,100
The storm's passing.

1041
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:09,400
A torn shutter or two,
some trash on the beach.

1042
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:12,980
In a few hours, there'll be little
to remind you of what happened tonight.

1043
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:17,030
Will we ever see you again, Frank?

1044
01:08:17,530 --> 01:08:19,030
Yeah, the storm.

1045
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:21,160
It's passing.

1046
01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:24,700
- Will we?
- I hope so.

1047
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:26,870
Why don't you stay right on
here with us, Frank?

1048
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,460
You're most welcome.

1049
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:30,920
Go on, tell him, Nora.

1050
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:34,540
If he decides to stay here with us,
we'd be most happy.

1051
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,340
Go on, tell Frank.

1052
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,050
Have you any folks?

1053
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:41,300
No.

1054
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:44,600
I'd be proud to have you
regard us as your family.

1055
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,020
Maybe that isn't what Frank wants.

1056
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:50,470
Oh, I don't mean to set onto you, son.

1057
01:08:50,730 --> 01:08:53,190
Think it over.
Don't give your answer right away.

1058
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,150
Hey, boss! Hey, hey, boss!

1059
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:57,030
- What's the matter?
- The boat's gone!

1060
01:08:57,190 --> 01:08:58,530
What?

1061
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:10,000
He did it.

1062
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:12,630
I told him I'd kill him,
but he did it just the same.

1063
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:15,040
Maybe he'll come back
now the storm's over.

1064
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:16,210
- No.
- Why not?

1065
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:17,760
Because he believed me
when I told him I'd kill him.

1066
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:18,920
Well, what are we gonna do?

1067
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:20,430
- We can't stay here!
- Can we?

1068
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:26,550
Hey, boss?

1069
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:34,610
Your mistake, sister.

1070
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:36,820
- We're not in any trouble.
- Got something?

1071
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:41,780
There's another boat out there.
It ain't much, but it'll get us to Cuba.

1072
01:09:41,950 --> 01:09:43,280
Who's going to run it?

1073
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:49,870
Him.

1074
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:54,780
Mr. Temple! You not good man!
You not let nobody in! That's no good!

1075
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,090
Tom Osceola.

1076
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:57,920
- Tom, Tom...
- Oh, shut up!

1077
01:09:58,090 --> 01:10:00,300
You leave women and baby out here
in storm? That no good!

1078
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:03,000
You no more friend, my brother and me.
We no do like you say anymore!

1079
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:05,510
No go Ben Wade!
You no good friend to Indian!

1080
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:07,470
Tom, Tom!

1081
01:10:08,850 --> 01:10:11,310
You told me you sent them away.
You lied to me.

1082
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:14,150
They were outside
my door during the whole storm.

1083
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:16,360
- So what?
- Well, they might've died out there.

1084
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,940
And who cares?

1085
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:19,650
You filth.

1086
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:22,650
What he said, you can run a boat.
That's a fact, huh?

1087
01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:25,160
His first sweetheart was a boat.

1088
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:27,870
You're taking us to Cuba.

1089
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:29,120
Why should I?

1090
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:30,860
Because you know
what'll happen to you if you don't.

1091
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,250
I won't take you.

1092
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:35,290
You mean, you'd rather die than take us?

1093
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:37,210
- I didn't say that.
- Hmm?

1094
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:40,800
You won't kill me because I'm your
only chance of getting away from here.

1095
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:44,720
There's other ways of getting at you.
Right, Toots?

1096
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:45,970
Right.

1097
01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:48,630
- Maybe I'm up to them.
- Oh, no, you wouldn't be.

1098
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:52,730
After a few minutes of Toots, here, you'll
begin to ask yourself questions like,

1099
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,310
"What if I come out of this a cripple?"

1100
01:10:56,020 --> 01:11:00,020
And uh, "Do I care whether they make
their getaway or don't?"

1101
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:02,530
All your answers would be right ones.

1102
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:05,030
- I'm not so sure.
- I am.

1103
01:11:05,490 --> 01:11:07,490
Of course, if you're anxious
and want to find out

1104
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:10,870
just how good you are at taking it,
we'll accommodate you.

1105
01:11:11,410 --> 01:11:12,580
But let me warn you.

1106
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:14,620
Toots hasn't had much practice.

1107
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:16,540
Kind of rusty. Might slip.

1108
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:18,700
And that'd be too bad.

1109
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:22,250
Because you made real sense
upstairs when you said that, uh,

1110
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,720
"One Rocco more or less
ain't worth dying for."

1111
01:11:28,930 --> 01:11:30,260
Ziggy!

1112
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:32,720
Yeah.

1113
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:35,520
Mr. Temple!

1114
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:38,730
Mr. Temple!

1115
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:40,150
The law.

1116
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,240
One wrong word out of anybody
and he gets it the same as Sawyer did.

1117
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,700
Temple!

1118
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:47,280
Understand me, old man?

1119
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:48,780
Temple!

1120
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:53,490
Now, you, sister, let him in.

1121
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:57,250
Hey, Temple!

1122
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:07,720
Good evening, Ms. Temple.

1123
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,130
I'm looking for Sawyer. Is he here?

1124
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:11,510
No.

1125
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,260
Has he been here?

1126
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,600
No.

1127
01:12:14,810 --> 01:12:17,850
That's funny. He put a call into me
from here about 7:00.

1128
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:19,600
- Did he?
- Yeah.

1129
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,610
- Good evening, Temple. Folks.
- Ben.

1130
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:24,600
- Pretty good blow, huh?
- Yeah.

1131
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:26,940
Did some damage, I see.

1132
01:12:27,570 --> 01:12:29,610
Power lines are down
in a couple of places.

1133
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:32,080
- How's the road?
- Passable.

1134
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:34,120
I'm trying to locate Sawyer.

1135
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:35,780
Seen him, anybody?

1136
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:46,090
Have you seen Sawyer?

1137
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:48,460
No.

1138
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:51,390
Well, he was here, I know
because he called me from here.

1139
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:52,970
About 7:00.

1140
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,350
I called back a few minutes later.

1141
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,060
Somebody answered. Was it one of you?

1142
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:00,400
I did.

1143
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:02,270
Oh, you?

1144
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:05,260
I just come down from upstairs
when you called.

1145
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,570
There was nobody around, so I answered.

1146
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:10,070
Probably he stopped in to make his call.

1147
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:12,490
Then he went on and got caught
in the storm.

1148
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,740
He's stalled someplace along the road
right now, probably.

1149
01:13:15,910 --> 01:13:17,830
Well, he ain't between here
and Palm Grove.

1150
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:20,750
And he wouldn't have called me
unless it was something special.

1151
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,540
Seen anything of the Osceola brothers?

1152
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,090
- Have you?
- No.

1153
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:30,080
I figured that was what was all about.
His call, I mean.

1154
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:31,590
The Osceola brothers.

1155
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:34,640
Couple of Indians busted out of jail,
and we're looking for them.

1156
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:35,800
Oh.

1157
01:13:35,970 --> 01:13:38,100
I'll take a run down Matecumbe Way.

1158
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:41,100
If Sawyer shows up, tell him to wait.
I'll be back.

1159
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:42,690
See you later.

1160
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,280
First visit to the Keys, Mr...

1161
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,100
- Brown.
- Yeah.

1162
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,910
Late in the season for a storm like this.

1163
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:54,620
They usually hit the early part
of the summer.

1164
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:55,780
Oh, is that so?

1165
01:13:55,950 --> 01:13:57,700
- Been doing any fishing?
- Yeah.

1166
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,410
Well, there's no better fishing
anywhere than on the Keys.

1167
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:02,290
See you later.

1168
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:05,340
It's him!

1169
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:06,690
Sawyer!

1170
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:08,270
He's murdered!

1171
01:15:08,610 --> 01:15:11,110
Well, look, I didn't wanna say anything.
After all, it's not my business.

1172
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:14,100
But those Indians you were
talking about, they were here.

1173
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,450
The Osceolas?

1174
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:18,910
Yeah, they were here all during the storm.
They left only a couple of minutes ago.

1175
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:51,060
Stop!

1176
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,030
Stop or I'll shoot!

1177
01:15:56,950 --> 01:15:58,990
Watch yourselves. Stay in line.

1178
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:19,930
He's dead.

1179
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:22,510
Your Indians murdered Sawyer.

1180
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:25,470
You lied to me, Temple.

1181
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:28,390
You said you hadn't seen the Osceolas.
You lied, didn't you?

1182
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:31,010
I knew Sawyer had been here.
That's why he called me.

1183
01:16:31,190 --> 01:16:32,690
Because he'd found the Osceolas.

1184
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:34,610
They thought they could hide it
by sinking his body,

1185
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:37,520
but they couldn't. The storm tore
his body loose and threw it up.

1186
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:39,490
Right at your door.

1187
01:16:40,490 --> 01:16:42,910
And that's where the crime belongs,
at your door.

1188
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:47,500
You probably knew they killed Sawyer.
I wouldn't put it past you!

1189
01:16:47,790 --> 01:16:50,370
And I'm gonna lay charges
naming you as accessory.

1190
01:16:51,210 --> 01:16:52,540
What was the shooting?

1191
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,420
The Osceolas, they tried to get away.

1192
01:16:55,090 --> 01:16:56,510
I killed them both.

1193
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:14,900
Brown, what's your first name?

1194
01:17:15,690 --> 01:17:17,070
Howard.

1195
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:20,480
Address?

1196
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,410
Hotel Central, Milwaukee.

1197
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:27,150
- How long you gonna be here?
- A week.

1198
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:32,580
Haven't I seen you someplace before?

1199
01:17:33,210 --> 01:17:34,590
I don't think so.

1200
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:36,990
You.

1201
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:40,260
Hoff. Richard.

1202
01:17:41,970 --> 01:17:44,140
Hotel Central, Milwaukee.

1203
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:46,310
We're all together.

1204
01:17:47,470 --> 01:17:48,680
Your full name.

1205
01:17:49,470 --> 01:17:51,510
Frank McCloud. No address.

1206
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:53,850
What are you doing here?

1207
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:55,650
Passing through.

1208
01:17:57,860 --> 01:17:59,030
You.

1209
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:02,110
Bass. Edward Bass.
Hotel Central, Milwaukee.

1210
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,440
We're all together.

1211
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,870
How far to Key West?

1212
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:14,250
How far to Key West?

1213
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:16,460
About 100 miles.

1214
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,090
Some hurricane.

1215
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:20,420
Thought it would blow us
right out into the ocean.

1216
01:18:21,090 --> 01:18:24,010
Had to pull up on the road for
a couple of hours till it blew over.

1217
01:18:24,630 --> 01:18:26,250
That's some hurricane.

1218
01:18:26,510 --> 01:18:28,350
I'll be back in the morning.

1219
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:31,180
Can we get something to eat?

1220
01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:33,440
Can we?

1221
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:56,500
In there, everybody.

1222
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:17,350
Hi, Ziggy!

1223
01:19:17,850 --> 01:19:19,680
Johnny-boy, how are you?

1224
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:22,360
Well, well, well. What do you know?

1225
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,200
You're a sight for sore eyes!

1226
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:26,860
Come on in.

1227
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:29,980
Hey, boys. Ziggy!

1228
01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:33,040
It's sure great to see you again,
Johnny pal.

1229
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:35,200
Well, it sure is swell.

1230
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,130
Hey, Rocco. You put on a little weight.

1231
01:19:40,670 --> 01:19:42,300
Well, now wait a minute.
Look who's talking!

1232
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:43,550
Oh, look out!

1233
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:48,590
- Say, guess who's here?
- Who?

1234
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:50,590
Gaye!

1235
01:19:50,890 --> 01:19:51,890
Gaye, where are you?

1236
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:53,640
Gaye Dawn? Don't tell me!

1237
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,390
Well, I'll be...

1238
01:19:58,730 --> 01:20:02,440
- Say, she's as pretty as ever.
- Yeah.

1239
01:20:04,730 --> 01:20:08,020
Where you been all the time
Johnny was away, huh?

1240
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:09,490
Around.

1241
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:12,200
If I'd have known that, I'd have
tried to beat Johnny's time.

1242
01:20:13,370 --> 01:20:14,660
Same old Ziggy, huh?

1243
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:17,120
All right, baby.

1244
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:21,340
I know you fellas are in a hurry, huh?

1245
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:22,500
Yeah.

1246
01:20:23,090 --> 01:20:24,210
Oh, uh, Curly.

1247
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:39,430
Lou.

1248
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:47,030
Paper has a good feel.

1249
01:21:03,670 --> 01:21:05,170
Lathe work's okay.

1250
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:09,170
Portrait's good. No breaks in the lines.

1251
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:11,680
- Serial numbers check out?
- Yeah, naturally.

1252
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:21,310
Back color's okay.

1253
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:25,230
High-class merchandise.

1254
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:27,190
- Okay.
- Okay.

1255
01:21:49,010 --> 01:21:51,050
Hey, fella, what are you gonna do?

1256
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:54,140
Don't go with them.

1257
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:56,890
They'd wait till you get them
inside of Cuba, then they'd kill you.

1258
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:58,890
You'd never walk off that boat.

1259
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:02,770
She's right, Frank.
Tell them you'll go, or they'll hurt you.

1260
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:06,270
Then when you get outside in the dark,
make a break, run. Try to get away.

1261
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:08,110
It's your only chance, fella.

1262
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:11,610
Frank, what are you thinking?

1263
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:14,620
You were right.

1264
01:22:15,490 --> 01:22:19,410
Your head says one thing
and your whole life says another.

1265
01:22:20,290 --> 01:22:22,210
Your head always loses.

1266
01:22:23,330 --> 01:22:26,000
Out there in the dark,
make a break for it.

1267
01:22:26,210 --> 01:22:27,540
Run, fella!

1268
01:22:28,090 --> 01:22:31,050
Yeah, that's what my head says.

1269
01:22:31,210 --> 01:22:32,920
You gonna make a fight of it, Frank?

1270
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:34,720
I've got to.

1271
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,800
Not that one Rocco more or less makes
any difference in this world.

1272
01:22:38,890 --> 01:22:40,770
What I said upstairs still goes.

1273
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:42,520
I haven't changed my tune.

1274
01:22:43,310 --> 01:22:46,980
It's just that I've got to.

1275
01:22:47,150 --> 01:22:50,900
Well, if you're a fighter,
you can't walk away from a fight.

1276
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:52,740
That's the answer, I guess.

1277
01:22:56,530 --> 01:22:58,160
Here you are, Curly.

1278
01:22:58,410 --> 01:23:00,040
Well, Johnny pal.

1279
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:01,790
When are you coming back again?

1280
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,080
It won't be long now.

1281
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:06,080
With you back again,
it'll be like old times, huh?

1282
01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:12,210
- You know something?
- Yeah?

1283
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:15,550
I bet inside of two years
we have Prohibition back again.

1284
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:17,970
- Only this time, it's gonna be different.
- Right.

1285
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:19,640
- The mobs will be together.
- Yeah.

1286
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:21,920
- No more blasting each other.
- You said it.

1287
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:27,690
- So long, Johnny pal.
- So long, Ziggy.

1288
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:29,970
- Yeah. Yeah.
- See you when.

1289
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:44,240
Let's get started.

1290
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:47,330
Bring everything down.
The soldier's stuff, too.

1291
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:48,710
Oh, soldier?

1292
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,750
Give Ralph a hand.

1293
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:52,800
Coming with us?

1294
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:54,720
Yes or no? I'm in a hurry.

1295
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:56,880
Toots, go to work on him.

1296
01:24:00,090 --> 01:24:01,090
You win.

1297
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:03,640
I thought you'd change your mind
the last minute.

1298
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:06,690
Well, what's the damage, old man?

1299
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:09,860
That ought to take care of it.

1300
01:24:11,610 --> 01:24:13,070
Want to come along, sister?

1301
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:19,160
All right.

1302
01:24:39,090 --> 01:24:40,550
Okay, boys.

1303
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:52,900
Give me.

1304
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,450
Where are my things?

1305
01:25:00,610 --> 01:25:02,690
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
You're not coming.

1306
01:25:03,530 --> 01:25:05,650
Here, on this, you can
stay drunk for a month.

1307
01:25:05,830 --> 01:25:07,540
- Johnny, please take me with you.
- Let go.

1308
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:10,740
- Get away!
- You got to, Johnny. You got to, please!

1309
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:12,380
- Come on.
- I'll stop drinking. I'll do anything.

1310
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:13,710
Only take me with you.

1311
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:16,210
- Please, Johnny. I love you! I need you!
- Let go of me, will you?

1312
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:19,800
I'll kill myself, I will! Johnny, please!
Please!

1313
01:25:19,970 --> 01:25:22,430
Listen, I'll be good to you,
like I was before.

1314
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:25,220
I won't let you go without me!
You've got to take me with you!

1315
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:27,850
- You've got to, you've got to!
- Get away from me!

1316
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:29,390
Come on, soldier!

1317
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:38,480
Get going, soldier.

1318
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:45,200
Good luck, son.

1319
01:25:45,410 --> 01:25:47,160
Yeah, good luck.

1320
01:26:06,890 --> 01:26:08,390
Why doesn't he run?

1321
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:10,350
Run, fella, run!

1322
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:14,610
Why doesn't he run?

1323
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:09,660
Will you cast off that bowline?

1324
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:12,500
Stand by that stern line.

1325
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,870
Okay, let her go.

1326
01:27:58,710 --> 01:28:00,590
That was his only chance.

1327
01:28:01,420 --> 01:28:02,880
He didn't take it.

1328
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:05,870
He should've run.

1329
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:14,220
The lines are dead.

1330
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:46,620
How we doing?

1331
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,590
We're right on course.

1332
01:28:48,970 --> 01:28:50,760
Well, keep us that way.

1333
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:01,360
How you feeling, Toots?

1334
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,770
Oh, I feel awful.

1335
01:29:03,940 --> 01:29:05,440
Why don't you go downstairs?

1336
01:29:05,730 --> 01:29:07,180
It's too hot down there.

1337
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:10,110
What time is it?

1338
01:29:11,950 --> 01:29:13,410
A little after four.

1339
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:15,290
We're not halfway there, yet.

1340
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:18,040
- Johnny's sleeping?
- Yeah.

1341
01:29:41,890 --> 01:29:43,760
Dog, Unit, Man, Roger.

1342
01:29:43,940 --> 01:29:48,030
Numeral 0-2-2-4-0-0-Z.

1343
01:29:48,570 --> 01:29:50,150
Man, Roger, X-ray, George.

1344
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:52,410
Group numerals 4-5.

1345
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:57,160
Missing fishing boat Santana
is being taken to Cuba. X-ray.

1346
01:29:57,490 --> 01:30:00,240
Sea search of area B immediately. X-ray.

1347
01:30:00,410 --> 01:30:02,410
Is us they are talking about on the radio?

1348
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:04,080
Oh, let them.

1349
01:30:04,830 --> 01:30:07,450
In a fog like this, they couldn't find
the Queen Mary.

1350
01:30:09,210 --> 01:30:10,370
Hey, Curly!

1351
01:30:13,510 --> 01:30:15,180
What time is it?

1352
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:18,010
- A little after four.
- Oh.

1353
01:30:19,270 --> 01:30:20,480
- Say, Johnny.
- Yeah.

1354
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:23,010
- I've been thinking.
- Yeah?

1355
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:25,860
- About Gaye.
- What about her?

1356
01:30:26,110 --> 01:30:28,320
Do you think it was such a good idea
not to bring her?

1357
01:30:29,020 --> 01:30:31,980
- She's pretty sore.
- Oh, so she's sore.

1358
01:30:32,450 --> 01:30:34,070
Yeah, but she might squeal.

1359
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:36,410
Just for spite.

1360
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:38,240
On Ziggy, I mean.

1361
01:30:40,450 --> 01:30:41,530
Well?

1362
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,880
Oh.

1363
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:47,170
I get it.

1364
01:30:47,710 --> 01:30:49,460
There's only one Johnny.

1365
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:19,160
Hey, you.

1366
01:31:19,910 --> 01:31:22,410
Take a look over the stern.
See if we picked up any kelp.

1367
01:31:30,590 --> 01:31:31,920
Oh.

1368
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:33,760
I feel awful.

1369
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:46,650
Toots, help!

1370
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:23,300
Curly?

1371
01:32:24,850 --> 01:32:26,180
What's the matter?

1372
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:30,980
Curly?

1373
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:37,980
My gun. It's gone.

1374
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:41,030
Gaye.

1375
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:50,080
Toots.

1376
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:52,380
Ralph.

1377
01:32:54,590 --> 01:32:55,630
Soldier.

1378
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:57,470
Hey there, soldier!

1379
01:32:58,420 --> 01:32:59,460
Soldier?

1380
01:33:06,350 --> 01:33:07,680
Curly.

1381
01:33:10,270 --> 01:33:12,150
- Angel, you go up.
- Huh?

1382
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:13,650
Go on! Do you hear me?

1383
01:33:14,820 --> 01:33:15,820
I'll get killed.

1384
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:17,930
You gonna go up there? Are you?

1385
01:33:18,530 --> 01:33:20,860
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Toots killed him, he's dead.

1386
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:23,030
Then you go check.

1387
01:33:31,330 --> 01:33:32,380
Soldier.

1388
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,000
Listen to me.

1389
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:36,250
Angel and Curly are dead.

1390
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:38,080
There's just me and you.

1391
01:33:38,550 --> 01:33:40,760
From now on, we'll be partners.
Everything will be 50-50.

1392
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:42,130
What do you say?

1393
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:44,550
Can you hear me?

1394
01:33:45,470 --> 01:33:47,140
What do you say? Is it a deal?

1395
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:52,730
I know what you're thinking.

1396
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:55,480
You get rid of me and have all
the money for yourself, is that it?

1397
01:33:55,730 --> 01:33:56,980
Is it?

1398
01:33:57,230 --> 01:33:58,280
Answer me!

1399
01:34:01,780 --> 01:34:03,280
I'll tell you what.

1400
01:34:04,410 --> 01:34:06,080
Suppose I say the money is yours.

1401
01:34:07,330 --> 01:34:08,500
Yeah!

1402
01:34:11,710 --> 01:34:12,750
Here, look!

1403
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:16,500
It's yours.

1404
01:34:16,790 --> 01:34:18,120
All yours, soldier.

1405
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:19,960
Plenty more when we get to Cuba.

1406
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:22,750
Okay, soldier?

1407
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:25,000
You hear me?

1408
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:26,810
I'll make you rich!

1409
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:30,600
Soldier!

1410
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:32,770
Soldier!

1411
01:34:34,730 --> 01:34:37,320
You're not big enough to do this to Rocco.
I'll kill you!

1412
01:34:37,610 --> 01:34:39,530
You'll never bring me in. Never!

1413
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:45,450
Look, soldier, I know what it is.

1414
01:34:46,570 --> 01:34:49,650
You figure I got a gun,
so you can't trust me. Right?

1415
01:34:50,990 --> 01:34:52,150
Okay.

1416
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:00,210
Look!

1417
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:02,010
See?

1418
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:03,750
I'm leveling with you.

1419
01:35:04,630 --> 01:35:05,960
Okay, soldier?

1420
01:35:06,970 --> 01:35:07,970
I'm coming out.

1421
01:35:10,010 --> 01:35:11,550
Okay, soldier?

1422
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:16,150
I got no gun and I'm coming out.

1423
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:19,770
Soldier!

1424
01:36:52,410 --> 01:36:54,580
Mayday. Mayday.

1425
01:36:54,830 --> 01:36:56,250
Mayday.

1426
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:00,290
Calling Nan, Mike, Abel.

1427
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:02,340
Calling Nan, Mike, Abel.

1428
01:37:02,790 --> 01:37:05,250
This is Abel, Sugar, Abel, Nan.
Abel, Sugar, Abel, Nan.

1429
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:08,090
Calling Nan, Mike, Abel.
Calling Nan, Mike, Abel.

1430
01:37:08,590 --> 01:37:09,680
Come in, please.

1431
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:13,350
This is Nan, Mike, Abel.
This is Nan, Mike, Abel. Go ahead.

1432
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:16,270
This is Abel, Sugar, Abel, Nan.

1433
01:37:17,180 --> 01:37:18,560
The Santana.

1434
01:37:19,270 --> 01:37:21,060
My name is Frank McCloud.

1435
01:37:21,850 --> 01:37:25,600
I'm about 12 miles off
Boot Key Harbor, on my way in.

1436
01:37:26,190 --> 01:37:27,190
Over.

1437
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:30,060
Are you all right?
Are you all right? Over.

1438
01:37:31,110 --> 01:37:34,690
Yes, but I need medical attention. Over.

1439
01:37:35,620 --> 01:37:36,950
Continue on course.

1440
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:38,650
Stand by on this frequency.

1441
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:41,290
I'm standing by.

1442
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:46,460
Will you put me through to
the Largo Hotel?

1443
01:37:47,170 --> 01:37:48,340
Stand by.

1444
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:54,220
State police picked up that fellow Ziggy
and his men crossing into Georgia.

1445
01:37:54,470 --> 01:37:56,600
You'll have to go up
and identify 'em, miss.

1446
01:37:59,810 --> 01:38:01,190
Mr. Temple.

1447
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:03,770
I'm mighty grateful to you
for saving my life and all

1448
01:38:03,940 --> 01:38:07,070
but those two boys, the Osceolas.

1449
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:10,640
I'd rather been killed than have
innocent blood on my hands.

1450
01:38:10,820 --> 01:38:13,320
Oh, I'm the one to blame.

1451
01:38:13,530 --> 01:38:16,030
If they hadn't trusted me,
they wouldn't have turned up here

1452
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,040
and they'd still be alive.

1453
01:38:18,410 --> 01:38:21,330
It seems we can't do anything
but harm to those people

1454
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:23,250
even when we go to help them.

1455
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:25,630
No, Mr. Temple, it wasn't you.

1456
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,050
It wasn't the law or anybody.

1457
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:30,130
It was only Johnny Rocco.

1458
01:38:30,340 --> 01:38:33,090
Nobody in the whole world is safe
as long as he's alive.

1459
01:38:35,890 --> 01:38:37,600
We better go, miss.

1460
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:57,700
Hotel Largo.

1461
01:38:59,950 --> 01:39:01,040
Frank.

1462
01:39:08,380 --> 01:39:09,880
Oh, thank God.

1463
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:35,650
He's all right, Dad.
He's coming back to us.
