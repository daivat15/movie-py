<i>It is starting like this.</i>

2
00:01:24,214 --> 00:01:25,841
Let's keep looking.

3
00:01:25,924 --> 00:01:27,885
They aren't good enough.

4
00:01:29,094 --> 00:01:30,345
Let's take that girl.

5
00:01:30,428 --> 00:01:31,554
Which one?

6
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:33,181
That girl. Zoey. Let's take her.

7
00:01:33,265 --> 00:01:34,557
Ah... No.

8
00:01:35,726 --> 00:01:37,144
What about that one?

9
00:01:37,227 --> 00:01:38,228
Him?

10
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:39,312
Yes.

11
00:01:39,396 --> 00:01:41,523
<i>Our country is at war</i>

12
00:01:41,606 --> 00:01:43,859
<i>and we are having no more school.</i>

13
00:01:43,942 --> 00:01:47,195
<i>So we are having to be finding ways
to be keeping busy.</i>

14
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:00,959
And what am I gonna do with this, Agu?

15
00:02:01,043 --> 00:02:02,460
It's a TV. I'm selling it.

16
00:02:02,544 --> 00:02:04,504
This dirty thing with no screen?

17
00:02:04,587 --> 00:02:05,588
Let's go!

18
00:02:05,673 --> 00:02:07,215
Soap opera.

19
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:08,466
Be quick!

20
00:02:09,968 --> 00:02:11,385
Please, I love you.

21
00:02:11,386 --> 00:02:12,220
- Please, I love you.
- I don't love you.

22
00:02:12,304 --> 00:02:13,138
But why?

23
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:14,556
- But why?
- Because you're not handsome. Go!

24
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,473
Oh, please, I beg.

25
00:02:15,474 --> 00:02:16,684
- Oh, please, I beg.
- Don't follow me. Go!

26
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:18,268
<i>I am having the ideas.</i>

27
00:02:18,351 --> 00:02:21,354
- Go!
- <i>And Dike is having the talent.</i>

28
00:02:23,774 --> 00:02:24,858
Dance! Dance! Dance!

29
00:02:35,118 --> 00:02:36,078
Kung fu! Kung fu!

30
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,537
Kung fu! Kung fu!

31
00:02:39,957 --> 00:02:42,375
Yeah!

32
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:43,585
Yes!

33
00:02:45,087 --> 00:02:47,130
It's garbage.
All of you go away!

34
00:02:47,214 --> 00:02:49,842
It's an imagination TV!
How can you say it's garbage?

35
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:51,009
It's garbage, Agu.

36
00:02:52,594 --> 00:02:54,930
Don't worry, let's go.

37
00:02:57,265 --> 00:02:59,727
<i>We are living in a buffer zone.</i>

<i>That is why so many refugees
are coming here small-small.</i>

41
00:03:19,496 --> 00:03:21,749
Master, master,
please, will you buy this TV?

42
00:03:21,832 --> 00:03:23,333
How am I supposed to watch this?

43
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,335
This is imagination TV.

44
00:03:25,418 --> 00:03:28,005
<i>The Nigerians are keeping the peace.</i>

45
00:03:28,088 --> 00:03:30,257
It is imagination TV.

46

<i>They are always buying things,
so they are easy to be selling to.</i>

47
00:03:35,303 --> 00:03:36,847
3D!

48
00:03:41,935 --> 00:03:44,813
Okay. How much for this treasure?

49
00:03:44,897 --> 00:03:46,106
Three thousand.

50
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:48,358
Huh? Three thousand. Too much!
Thousand five.

51
00:03:48,441 --> 00:03:49,818
Thousand five no good.

52
00:03:49,902 --> 00:03:51,068
Two thousand. Two thousand.

53
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:52,029
- Two thousand. Two thousand.
- Two thou.

54
00:03:52,112 --> 00:03:53,906
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Thousand five.

55
00:03:54,865 --> 00:03:55,698
Some food, some food.

56
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:58,579
- Some food, some food.
- Bring out some of your food and take it.

57
00:03:58,952 --> 00:04:01,663
Uche, bring the foods and come.

58
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:10,255
Here, take. Go!

59
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:34,279
<i>I am a good boy from a good family.</i>

60

<i>My mother is always working hard for us.</i>

61
00:04:36,656 --> 00:04:38,136
Taste this.

62
00:04:40,577 --> 00:04:41,703
Thank you.

63
00:04:42,537 --> 00:04:43,746
It's good.

64
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,210

- "Soaring."
- "Soaring overhead."

68
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:56,634
Nice idea.

69
00:04:57,552 --> 00:04:59,012
<i>My father was a teacher.</i>

70
00:04:59,096 --> 00:05:00,097
Clap for him!

71
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:03,475
That's good.
And another one!

72
00:05:05,477 --> 00:05:06,728
That's good.

73
00:05:06,812 --> 00:05:07,813
Agu!

74
00:05:07,896 --> 00:05:09,439
Where do lions live?

75
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,441
In the zoo.

76
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:12,860
Shame him.

77
00:05:12,943 --> 00:05:14,486
Shame!

78
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:16,321
Who can tell me where lions live?

79
00:05:16,404 --> 00:05:20,325
<i>I like my father more
now that he's not my teacher.</i>

80

<i>Since the war, he is a busy man.</i>

81
00:05:23,661 --> 00:05:25,956
<i>He is using some of our land</i>

82
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,334
<i>so that the refugees
can be making a new village.</i>

83
00:05:30,335 --> 00:05:33,505
What we need now is medicine.

84
00:05:34,506 --> 00:05:35,715
<i>Big brother.</i>

85
00:05:35,798 --> 00:05:38,969
<i>He is more concerned
with his muscles and his hair.</i>

86
00:05:39,052 --> 00:05:42,764
<i>Sometimes I am adding to his soaps.</i>

87
00:05:45,267 --> 00:05:46,707
Stop that!

88
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,021
When I get a hold of you...

89
00:05:49,521 --> 00:05:50,522
Leave me alone!

90
00:05:50,605 --> 00:05:51,606
You have no respect!

91
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:54,692
I was trying to make it warmer for you!

92
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:55,777
Leave me alone!

93
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,155
You're lucky I don't shit on you.

94
00:05:58,238 --> 00:05:59,990
I'm gonna fart on your face.

95
00:06:00,073 --> 00:06:04,161
<i>Big brother is also
concerned with sleeping.</i>

96
00:06:04,244 --> 00:06:08,999
I want to sleep
with this girl before the war gets here.

97
00:06:13,962 --> 00:06:16,298
<i>I am not liking his music.</i>

98
00:06:16,381 --> 00:06:19,259
Let me go!
I didn't do anything to deserve this!

99
00:06:19,342 --> 00:06:22,012
<i>I am not liking his dancing.</i>

100
00:06:22,095 --> 00:06:25,098
<i>And how can that girl be sleeping
if he is making so much noise?</i>

101
00:06:25,182 --> 00:06:28,476
Let me go! I don't like this!

102
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,439
Treat your neighbor as your brother.

103
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:36,193
And treat the market vendor...

104
00:06:36,276 --> 00:06:38,570
as your mother or older sister.

105
00:06:38,653 --> 00:06:40,738
<i>My mother is always saying,</i>

106

<i>"you can always be
asking God for the answer."</i>

108
00:06:46,578 --> 00:06:47,704
Say Amen!

109
00:06:47,787 --> 00:06:48,788
Amen!

110
00:06:48,871 --> 00:06:49,957
Say it louder!

111
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,334
Amen!

112
00:06:54,002 --> 00:06:58,090
Choir, give us a song
and then we'll continue.

113
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:08,766
<i>God is liking music
more than just talking.</i>

114
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:13,855
<i>So if you are singing and dancing,
then he will be listening to us well-well.</i>

115
00:07:27,202 --> 00:07:28,954
Cut that branch.

116
00:07:29,037 --> 00:07:30,122
I'll fall.

117
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:31,331
Just hold on tight and cut it.

118
00:07:31,414 --> 00:07:32,415
No way.

119
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:33,666
Then cut that one instead.

120
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,628
Have your lazy friend do it.

121
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:37,795
He's the driver. Cut that one.

122
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:40,132
You're too small, you'll fall!

123
00:07:40,215 --> 00:07:42,134
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

124
00:07:42,217 --> 00:07:43,551
- Go home!
- You go home!

125
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:44,636
Midget.

126
00:07:45,637 --> 00:07:46,929
Cut it.

127
00:07:47,597 --> 00:07:49,057
He wants me to fall.

128
00:07:49,141 --> 00:07:51,351
If I was a taxi driver,
I'd drive around it.

129
00:07:57,983 --> 00:07:59,776
Get ready!

130
00:08:04,114 --> 00:08:05,115
What is this?

131
00:08:05,198 --> 00:08:07,617
We've been working all day.
Give us some money for our work.

132
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,910
Why did you block the road?

133
00:08:08,994 --> 00:08:11,288
We are trying to fix it.

134
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:13,206
Get out of here!

135
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,332
But we need to eat!

136
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,792
Take this.

137
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,252
I don't want your chicken.

138
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:27,304
Why are children so disrespectful?

139
00:08:27,887 --> 00:08:28,930
Huh?

140
00:08:29,014 --> 00:08:30,182
You!

141
00:08:30,265 --> 00:08:31,391
Curse be upon you.

142
00:08:31,474 --> 00:08:33,685
Curse yourself,
standing in the middle of the road.

143
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:35,187
I know you very well!

144
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,771
I know your whole family!

145
00:08:37,314 --> 00:08:38,898
You're thieves!

146
00:08:38,981 --> 00:08:40,817
You stole my land!
Me, an old woman!

147
00:08:41,443 --> 00:08:42,610
Do you want this chicken?

148
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:46,864
The devil will bless you one by one!

149
00:09:03,798 --> 00:09:05,050
<i>Grandfather.</i>

150
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:08,761
<i>The lights are on, but nobody is home.</i>

151
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:13,183
We saw that witch woman today.

152
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:15,768
She said we were thieves.

153
00:09:15,852 --> 00:09:17,770
Why would she say that?

154
00:09:17,854 --> 00:09:20,065
That woman...

155
00:09:20,148 --> 00:09:22,024
she's confused.

156
00:09:22,109 --> 00:09:24,194
God has taken her mind.

157
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:26,279
Slow down.

158
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:29,449
The land we gave to the refugees...

159
00:09:29,532 --> 00:09:31,951
has been in our family
since before your grandfather.

160
00:09:32,034 --> 00:09:34,204
I gave her a place, but she refused.

161
00:09:34,287 --> 00:09:35,413
So she's crazy?

162
00:09:44,046 --> 00:09:45,632
Ugh!

163
00:10:00,355 --> 00:10:01,398
What is this?

164
00:10:05,026 --> 00:10:06,653
Who did this to my TV?

165
00:10:10,198 --> 00:10:11,241
What is this?

166
00:10:13,075 --> 00:10:15,578
Agu! Agu!

167
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,695
If I acted like you when I was your age,

168
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:51,030
Dad would've beaten me.

169
00:10:51,113 --> 00:10:54,201
You're lucky there's a war.

170
00:10:54,284 --> 00:10:56,411
It's not luck, everybody loves me.

171
00:10:57,162 --> 00:10:58,455
Like who?

172
00:11:01,123 --> 00:11:02,834
There she is.

173
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:05,962
She's looking at you!

174
00:11:06,045 --> 00:11:07,297
Really?

175
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,381
Still?

176
00:11:08,465 --> 00:11:09,924
She looked away.

177
00:11:16,764 --> 00:11:18,324
Do you think she likes me?

178
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,726
My eyes are not good.

179
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:21,228
So you couldn't tell?

180
00:11:22,604 --> 00:11:24,021
You don't know what's up.

181
00:11:24,105 --> 00:11:28,025
When she sees these muscles,
she'll fall in love with me.

182
00:11:30,862 --> 00:11:33,656
<i>It would seem things are changing quickly</i>

183
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,940
<i>within the interim government.</i>

184
00:11:34,991 --> 00:11:39,912
<i>As of this morning, the NRC junta
moved to abolish all political parties,</i>

185
00:11:39,996 --> 00:11:42,457
<i>further consolidating
their control of the government</i>

186
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,126
<i>in the wake of
the recent military coup.</i>

187
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:47,128
<i>Lieutenant General Sangania,</i>

188
00:11:47,211 --> 00:11:51,424
<i>commander-in-chief of the armed forces
responsible for the junta,</i>

189
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:53,551
<i>stated in a recent press conference</i>

190
00:11:53,635 --> 00:11:57,597
<i>that it was his intention
to rid the southern regions of the PLF,</i>

191
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,185
<i>who he accused of being financed
and supported by foreign institutions.</i>

192
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,814
<i>He also condemned
the Native Defense Force militias,</i>

193
00:12:06,898 --> 00:12:12,069
<i>who he said presented a threat
to the very fabric of national security.</i>

194
00:12:12,153 --> 00:12:15,282
<i>Sangania went on to promise
that the junta would accomplish</i>

195
00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:18,535
<i>what the previous regime had failed to do.</i>

196
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:22,872
<i>Speculation on the collaboration between
the armed forces and the PLF rebels...</i>

197
00:12:38,388 --> 00:12:41,068
<i>The NRC broke the agreement.</i>

198
00:12:41,516 --> 00:12:43,726
They've entered the buffer zone.

199
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:47,271
Now they want us to run away
and leave our town.

200
00:12:47,355 --> 00:12:48,481
We cannot do that.

201
00:12:48,565 --> 00:12:50,232
Never.

202
00:12:50,317 --> 00:12:52,444
This land is ours.

203
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,530
Our ancestors have lived here,
taken care of it, and left it for us.

204
00:12:55,613 --> 00:12:58,032
It's our duty to protect it...

205
00:12:58,115 --> 00:13:00,660
and leave it for our children.

206
00:13:02,745 --> 00:13:08,167
So we should send
the women and little children away...

207
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,837
under the protection of ECOMOD.

208
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,466
Where's Dike?

209
00:13:14,549 --> 00:13:20,472
And we who call ourselves men
will stay and protect our town.

210
00:13:22,181 --> 00:13:25,560
Who is going to take care of the property
we are leaving behind?

211
00:13:25,643 --> 00:13:27,269
Dad, where's Dike?

212
00:13:27,354 --> 00:13:28,521
They fled!

213
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:34,068
Let me go, it's my duty.

214
00:13:37,238 --> 00:13:43,202
We will be crushed between
the rebels and the army! It is so bad!

215
00:13:43,828 --> 00:13:45,455
We've already decided

216
00:13:45,538 --> 00:13:46,539
what to do with the children.

217
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,666
They will go with you.

218
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,252
He is old. We can't take him anywhere.

219
00:13:51,335 --> 00:13:53,921
You aren't listening to what I'm saying.

220
00:13:54,005 --> 00:13:56,925
Go to your sister in the city, I'll meet
you once everything is okay here.

221
00:13:57,008 --> 00:13:58,175
I can't abandon my responsibilities.

222
00:13:58,259 --> 00:13:59,427
But you are!

223
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:00,762
Don't think like that.

224
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:03,014
You want me to be a refugee
in my own country?

225
00:14:03,097 --> 00:14:04,932
With three small children and no husband?

226
00:14:05,016 --> 00:14:06,434
We are a family.

227
00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:08,853
We should stay together.

228
00:14:09,854 --> 00:14:12,023
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.

229
00:14:12,106 --> 00:14:14,651
There are bigger issues to take care of...

230
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:16,361
It's your turn.

231
00:14:16,444 --> 00:14:18,070
Dad's sending me away.

232
00:14:18,154 --> 00:14:21,198
He's sending you because
you're a little baby.

233
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,993
Play the game.

234
00:14:28,456 --> 00:14:30,625
Turn your light off.

235
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,210
Now turn it on and you'll feel better.

236
00:14:36,464 --> 00:14:39,091
What kind of face is that?

237
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:43,513
Your face is like a monkey's butt.

238
00:14:59,487 --> 00:15:01,989
Come on! Come on! Come on! Hurry up!

239
00:15:04,116 --> 00:15:06,411
Hurry! I see one! Hurry!

240
00:15:06,494 --> 00:15:07,954
<i>Citizens of the republic,
living in the buffer zone.</i>

241
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:09,038
Hurry!

242
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:12,875
<i>The National Reformation Council
recommend non-combatants</i>

243
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,961
<i>to leave the buffer zone immediately...</i>

244
00:15:15,044 --> 00:15:16,504
This one's full. There's another here.

245
00:15:16,588 --> 00:15:17,880
<i>...as military operations
begin as planned.</i>

246
00:15:17,964 --> 00:15:19,173
Wait. Help me.

247
00:15:19,256 --> 00:15:20,341
Is it heavy? Give it to me.

248
00:15:20,425 --> 00:15:21,426
Agu, take it.

249
00:15:22,677 --> 00:15:24,178
Please, move. Move!

250
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:25,387
Move back. Go back.

251
00:15:25,472 --> 00:15:26,723
No space. No space.

252
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:30,392
Please, please, I am the Section Chief.
This is my family. There must be space.

253
00:15:30,477 --> 00:15:31,478
No space.

254
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:33,020
This one woman
and this small-small children.

255
00:15:33,104 --> 00:15:34,731
- And the little boy?
- Yes, him, too.

256
00:15:34,814 --> 00:15:37,399
Where are you thinking
this woman and child would be fitted?

257
00:15:37,484 --> 00:15:39,151
They're gonna be
sitting in the front with you.

258
00:15:39,235 --> 00:15:41,571
No, no, no, no, no.
Seventy thousand, no boy.

259
00:15:42,238 --> 00:15:43,239
With the boy.

260
00:15:43,322 --> 00:15:45,450
You wanting your woman to
walk through the bush to the capital?

261
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:47,702
I'd rather walk. I can't leave my child.

262
00:15:47,785 --> 00:15:48,786
You can't walk!

263
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,037
Please, how much to fit the boy?

264
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:51,497
Seventy thousand, no boy.

265
00:15:51,498 --> 00:15:52,499
- Seventy thousand, no boy.
- Driver! Driver, driver!

266
00:15:52,582 --> 00:15:54,667
Please, please, please.
Hey, hey. With the boy!

267
00:15:54,751 --> 00:15:57,253
No boy. No bargaining.

268
00:15:57,837 --> 00:15:59,338
I can't.

269
00:15:59,964 --> 00:16:01,173
Get in!

270
00:16:01,257 --> 00:16:02,550
I'll walk! I won't leave my child!

271
00:16:02,634 --> 00:16:04,010
There's no other way! Get in!

272
00:16:07,555 --> 00:16:10,182
Give her to her mother!

273
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:12,685
Give her to her mother!

274
00:16:16,648 --> 00:16:19,025
Remember to pray to God everyday.

275
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:22,695
I'll see you very soon.

276
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:24,321
Always pray! Don't be afraid!

277
00:16:24,405 --> 00:16:25,865
I will see you soon!

278
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:27,659
We'll find you, okay?

279
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:33,540
It's full! Everyone get back!

280
00:16:33,623 --> 00:16:34,874
We'll find you!

281
00:16:34,957 --> 00:16:36,208
Everything will be alright!

282
00:16:38,252 --> 00:16:39,253
Take this!

283
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:45,134
You're with the men now, keep quiet.

284
00:16:45,968 --> 00:16:46,969
Calm down.

285
00:16:50,848 --> 00:16:52,892
Calm down.

286
00:16:54,476 --> 00:16:58,022
Agu! Agu! Agu!

287
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,289
Let's go.

288
00:17:15,372 --> 00:17:17,374
Let's go home.

289
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:22,581
<i>And this is how it is starting.</i>

290
00:17:36,644 --> 00:17:39,063
Go take the clothes out of the rain.

291
00:17:39,146 --> 00:17:41,398
Agu, close the windows.

292
00:17:50,867 --> 00:17:55,204
<i>God, when I'm closing my eyes,</i>

293
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:58,833
<i>I am seeing
the rainy season in my village.</i>

294
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:03,838
<i>You can be finding the ground
is washing away beneath your feet.</i>

295
00:18:03,921 --> 00:18:09,510
<i>Nothing is ever for sure...
and everything is always changing.</i>

296
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:33,159
Agu! Agu!

297
00:18:45,838 --> 00:18:47,131
Hey.

298
00:18:52,094 --> 00:18:54,138
Come on! Hurry!

299
00:18:54,221 --> 00:18:56,348
Stay here. I'll call you when it's clear.

300
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:10,107
Hey! Hey, hey!

301
00:19:12,073 --> 00:19:13,783
Come on!

302
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:17,704
Hey!

303
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:24,919
Hurry!

304
00:19:26,087 --> 00:19:27,088
Hurry!

305
00:19:43,813 --> 00:19:45,647
We need to go. If they catch us...

306
00:19:46,816 --> 00:19:48,567
Keep quiet. They'll hear us.

307
00:19:53,865 --> 00:19:56,868
If we run away now,
they won't see us.

308
00:19:57,534 --> 00:20:00,496
Be patient. The soldiers are outside.

309
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:02,999
If you talk, they'll find us. Keep quiet.

310
00:20:24,896 --> 00:20:25,897
Agu...

311
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,523
whatever happens...

312
00:20:27,606 --> 00:20:29,108
it's God testing us.

313
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:31,861
We have to be strong.

314
00:20:42,413 --> 00:20:44,373
We have to go.

315
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:48,085
Open it.

316
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:49,586
Don't do it!

317
00:20:59,847 --> 00:21:00,848
Please.

318
00:21:04,685 --> 00:21:06,728
Turn around! Turn around!

319
00:21:06,813 --> 00:21:08,689
Give me a rope!

320
00:21:08,773 --> 00:21:10,607
I will kill you today.

321
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:14,486
Quiet.

322
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,570
Y'all shut your mouth!

323
00:21:15,571 --> 00:21:17,571
- Y'all shut your mouth!
- Shut your fuckin' mouth!

324
00:21:17,907 --> 00:21:19,200
Which faction do you fight for?

325
00:21:19,283 --> 00:21:20,117
No faction.

326
00:21:20,118 --> 00:21:21,368
- No faction.
- We are not fighters.

327
00:21:21,452 --> 00:21:23,830
We are from this town.

328
00:21:23,913 --> 00:21:25,915
We are protecting the stores.

329
00:21:25,998 --> 00:21:27,373
You are Native Defense Forces, hmm?

330
00:21:27,374 --> 00:21:28,375
- You are Native Defense Forces, hmm?
- No.

331
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:31,212
I am the Section Chief.
We are trying to stop the looters.

332
00:21:31,295 --> 00:21:32,922
Bring the woman.

333
00:21:33,005 --> 00:21:34,339
You are calling us looters.

334
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,700
- You are calling us looters.
- No. No. No, no, no.

335
00:21:40,137 --> 00:21:41,848
You fuckin' shit. Quiet!

336
00:21:41,931 --> 00:21:43,640
No, no.

337
00:21:45,267 --> 00:21:46,559
Do you know these men?

338
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,687
- Do you know these men?
- Master, master, master, please. Please.

339
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,815
This woman, everybody knows she's crazy.

340
00:21:50,898 --> 00:21:51,899
I don't know them.

341
00:21:51,983 --> 00:21:54,693
Master! Master, talk to her and you know
that she's not right in the head.

342
00:21:54,776 --> 00:21:56,653
They are not from here.
They must be rebels.

343
00:21:56,737 --> 00:21:58,030
We are not rebels.

344
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,370
We, the armed forces of
the National Reformation Council,

345
00:22:04,453 --> 00:22:05,454
find you all to be spies.

346
00:22:05,537 --> 00:22:06,538
- No!
- Please!

347
00:22:06,622 --> 00:22:10,126
I sentence you to
immediate and summary execution.

348
00:22:10,209 --> 00:22:11,878
Waste them.

349
00:22:11,961 --> 00:22:13,129
Run!

350
00:22:13,212 --> 00:22:14,796
Run!

351
00:22:14,881 --> 00:22:16,382
Run!

352
00:22:18,885 --> 00:22:20,302
Please, please, please.

353
00:27:13,304 --> 00:27:14,846
Kill them all!

354
00:27:16,139 --> 00:27:17,349
You! Hey!

355
00:27:25,607 --> 00:27:27,526
<i>Cease fire!</i>

356
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,613
Wanna die, fucking PLF?

357
00:27:32,614 --> 00:27:34,254
- Wanna die, fucking PLF?
- Fucking rebel.

358
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,535
Tie this fucking spongebag up.

359
00:27:38,078 --> 00:27:40,372
Hurry! Hurry!

360
00:27:40,456 --> 00:27:41,664
I'm gonna kill you, man!

361
00:27:41,665 --> 00:27:43,905
- I'm gonna kill you, man!
- This is not the right place.

362
00:27:44,042 --> 00:27:45,085
Take position.

363
00:27:45,168 --> 00:27:46,378
CO Hope, take your man.

364
00:27:46,462 --> 00:27:48,003
I'm gonna kill you.

365
00:27:48,004 --> 00:27:49,404
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Fucking PLF!

366
00:27:49,882 --> 00:27:51,174
Strip those PLF soldiers!

367
00:27:51,258 --> 00:27:52,259
Strip them.

368
00:27:52,343 --> 00:27:53,969
Move, move!

369
00:28:03,229 --> 00:28:04,688
Hey, you! Keep your eyes down.

370
00:28:04,771 --> 00:28:07,774
Don't look at me.

371
00:28:07,858 --> 00:28:11,528
Everybody move!
Here comes the Commandant.

372
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,074
You get out of the fucking way!

373
00:28:21,788 --> 00:28:24,333
What is this thing doing here?

374
00:28:26,335 --> 00:28:29,338
Who is responsible
for bringing this thing?

375
00:28:34,343 --> 00:28:37,346
Strika, is it you
that is bringing this thing?

376
00:28:39,723 --> 00:28:43,227
Strika, untie him.

377
00:28:44,811 --> 00:28:46,230
So all of you grown men,

378
00:28:46,313 --> 00:28:50,317
it is Strika, the small boy,
that is finding this prisoner.

379
00:28:51,943 --> 00:28:53,237
Where is Two-I-C?

380
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,529
Two-I-C!

381
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,656
- Two-I-C!
- Two-I-C!

382
00:28:55,739 --> 00:28:56,782
Two-I-C!

383
00:28:58,367 --> 00:28:59,868
Commandant, sir!

384
00:28:59,951 --> 00:29:03,664
Two-I-C, what are we
to be doing with this thing?

385
00:29:04,456 --> 00:29:07,376
This thing?
It is just a boy.

386
00:29:08,126 --> 00:29:09,753
A boy?

387
00:29:12,256 --> 00:29:14,215
A boy is nothing.

388
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,134
A boy is harmless?

389
00:29:16,217 --> 00:29:17,428
Harmless, no, sir!

390
00:29:17,511 --> 00:29:19,012
Does a boy have two eyes to see?

391
00:29:19,095 --> 00:29:20,514
Two eyes, sir!

392
00:29:20,597 --> 00:29:23,517
A boy has hands to strangle
and fingers to pull triggers.

393
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,686
Why you saying a boy is nothing? Huh?

394
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:29,022
A boy is very, very dangerous.
You understand me?

395
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:32,275
Very dangerous, you understand?

396
00:29:32,276 --> 00:29:33,193
- Very dangerous, you understand?
- Yes, sir!

397
00:29:33,277 --> 00:29:34,194
Huh?

398
00:29:34,195 --> 00:29:35,236
- Huh?
- Yes, sir!

399
00:29:35,321 --> 00:29:38,782
Strika, are you hungry?

400
00:29:38,865 --> 00:29:41,993
Are you wanting to be eating this thing?

401
00:29:46,873 --> 00:29:48,709
Let me see your hands.

402
00:29:52,921 --> 00:29:55,799
Oh, you have hands like a baby.

403
00:30:03,724 --> 00:30:05,559
What are you doing here?

404
00:30:09,187 --> 00:30:10,689
You should be telling me.

405
00:30:10,772 --> 00:30:12,566
If you are telling me,
I will be helping you.

406
00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:15,486
You see, Strika is hungry.
He will eat you.

407
00:30:15,569 --> 00:30:16,737
Huh?

408
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,780
What are you doing here?

409
00:30:25,329 --> 00:30:30,667
The government army killed my father...
and my big brother...

410
00:30:31,835 --> 00:30:36,757
and my father told me to run...
into the bush.

411
00:30:43,263 --> 00:30:45,306
Everybody here is
calling me Commandant.

412
00:30:45,391 --> 00:30:46,724
How does the Commandant look?

413
00:30:46,725 --> 00:30:47,809
- How does the Commandant look?
- All right, sir!

414
00:30:47,893 --> 00:30:49,059
How does the Commandant look?

415
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:49,895
- How does the Commandant look?
- All right, sir!

416
00:30:49,978 --> 00:30:51,688
Ah.

417
00:30:51,772 --> 00:30:54,149
Now, what are they calling you?

418
00:30:54,983 --> 00:30:55,984
Agu.

419
00:30:56,067 --> 00:30:58,278
Oh, you must say it
like you are prouder!

420
00:30:58,362 --> 00:30:59,905
Agu.

421
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:01,407
One more time.

422
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,323
Agu.

423
00:31:02,323 --> 00:31:03,199
- Agu.
- Uh-huh.

424
00:31:03,283 --> 00:31:05,452
Well, Agu,

425
00:31:05,536 --> 00:31:08,414
that is what I will be
calling you then, eh?

426
00:31:15,837 --> 00:31:21,092
Leave this one under my charge.
I will be training him to be a warrior.

427
00:31:21,176 --> 00:31:23,804
So you can be fighting
the army that is killing your father.

428
00:31:23,887 --> 00:31:27,724
Is that what you want?
You must be saying yes!

429
00:31:27,808 --> 00:31:29,100
Formation!

430
00:31:29,184 --> 00:31:30,060
Say yes!

431
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,894
- Say yes!
- Yes.

432
00:31:30,977 --> 00:31:32,061
"Yes, sir!"

433
00:31:32,062 --> 00:31:32,896
- "Yes, sir!"
- Yes, sir!

434
00:31:32,979 --> 00:31:34,855
"Yes, sir!"

435
00:31:34,856 --> 00:31:35,899
- "Yes, sir!"
- Yes, sir!

436
00:31:35,982 --> 00:31:36,817
"Yes, sir!"

437
00:31:36,817 --> 00:31:37,651
- "Yes, sir!"
- Yes, sir!

438
00:31:37,734 --> 00:31:39,277
- "Yes, sir!"
- Yes, sir!

439
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,403
One more time.

440
00:31:40,404 --> 00:31:41,279
- One more time.
- Yes, sir!

441
00:31:41,362 --> 00:31:42,238
One more time. Mmm-hmm.

442
00:31:42,239 --> 00:31:43,364
- One more time. Mmm-hmm.
- Yes, sir!

443
00:31:43,449 --> 00:31:44,450
Yes, sir!

444
00:31:44,533 --> 00:31:45,659
- Again.
- Yes, sir!

445
00:31:45,742 --> 00:31:46,577
Again.

446
00:31:46,577 --> 00:31:47,453
- Again.
- Yes, sir!

447
00:31:47,536 --> 00:31:48,787
- Again.
- Yes, sir!

448
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,623
Rambo, give this SBU some work.

449
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:54,250
You must carry this one.

450
00:31:54,334 --> 00:31:58,338
I saved your life. I saved your life.

451
00:31:58,422 --> 00:32:00,340
I saved your life. Go!

452
00:32:01,633 --> 00:32:02,634
Straight line, straight line!

453
00:32:02,718 --> 00:32:03,594
NDF!

454
00:32:03,595 --> 00:32:05,075
- NDF!
- Yes, sir!

455
00:32:05,303 --> 00:32:06,137
Move out.

456
00:32:06,138 --> 00:32:07,618
- Move out.
- Soldier, move!

457
00:32:07,931 --> 00:32:08,974
What are you waiting for?

458
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:10,976
Move! Quick, quick, quick.

459
00:32:11,768 --> 00:32:14,187
Move it! Move it! Move it! Move it!

460
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:18,233
Move! Move! Move it!

461
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:20,318
Move out!

462
00:32:20,318 --> 00:32:21,194
- Move out!
- Move out!

463
00:32:21,277 --> 00:32:23,071
Move, move, move, move.

464
00:32:31,204 --> 00:32:32,288
Move, move, move.

465
00:32:52,392 --> 00:32:53,769
Move it!

466
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,917
- Yes, Commandant, sir!
- Yes, sir!

467
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,127
- Commandant, sir!
- Yes, sir!

468
00:34:16,267 --> 00:34:17,853
- How our Commandant look?
- All right, sir!

469
00:34:17,936 --> 00:34:19,270
- How our Commandant look?
- All right, sir.

470
00:34:19,354 --> 00:34:20,271
How the Commandant look?

471
00:34:20,272 --> 00:34:21,272
- How the Commandant look?
- All right, sir!

472
00:34:21,356 --> 00:34:22,858
- How our Commandant look?
- All right, sir!

473
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:25,068
You are now under NDF control.

474
00:34:25,151 --> 00:34:27,487
If you're willing to stay, then stay.

475
00:34:27,571 --> 00:34:29,656
But you must be initiated.

476
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:30,574
Am I clear?

477
00:34:30,574 --> 00:34:31,407
- Am I clear?
- Yes, sir!

478
00:34:31,491 --> 00:34:32,618
They are not understanding me, boys.

479
00:34:32,701 --> 00:34:34,035
Show them what I'm talking about.

480
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:35,494
Raise... Put up your fucking hands!

481
00:34:35,495 --> 00:34:38,495
- Raise... Put up your fucking hands!
- Check them. Check them. Make sure...

482
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,506
Bring me the small boy.

483
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,716
This way.

484
00:34:49,009 --> 00:34:51,011
CO Hope!

485
00:34:55,181 --> 00:34:56,600
Yes, sir.

486
00:34:56,683 --> 00:35:00,896
This baby boy is your responsibility now.
Train him.

487
00:35:00,979 --> 00:35:04,608
Yes, sir! Come over.

488
00:35:04,691 --> 00:35:08,654
Come over! Fucking move!
Let's move. Move. Move.

489
00:35:43,563 --> 00:35:44,648
Move.

490
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,608
Please, can I have some of the food?

491
00:35:48,609 --> 00:35:50,969
Please, can I have some of the food?

492
00:35:51,154 --> 00:35:53,281
You think you are soldier now, eh?

493
00:35:53,364 --> 00:35:56,492
You's nothing.
You're not doing nothing here.

494
00:35:57,243 --> 00:36:00,121
I carry ammunition all day.

495
00:36:00,205 --> 00:36:03,750
You! Hey! Hey! Move!

496
00:36:03,834 --> 00:36:04,793
What? What I do?

497
00:36:04,794 --> 00:36:06,354
- What? What I do?
- Wake up!

498
00:36:07,963 --> 00:36:09,756
You go back and
stand on top of the chair.

499
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,841
Do it!

500
00:36:10,924 --> 00:36:13,176
I said go and stand
on top of the chair!

501
00:36:13,259 --> 00:36:16,262
Yeah. And salute!

502
00:36:17,848 --> 00:36:20,809
Two-I-C, go and call Strika to my house.

503
00:36:20,892 --> 00:36:24,020
CO Hope!
Send Strika to Commandant!

504
00:36:25,814 --> 00:36:27,190
Strika, go.

505
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,028
Where you go get
this thing from?

506
00:36:32,112 --> 00:36:34,948
Two-I-C tell me
to train this boy.

507
00:36:47,418 --> 00:36:50,756
Show me position! Make sure you are clear.
Move them, now!

508
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:51,840
Yes, sir!

509
00:36:51,923 --> 00:36:53,925
First group, move!

510
00:36:57,428 --> 00:36:59,973
You stay together! You stay together!

511
00:37:00,056 --> 00:37:02,517
Close the space.
You're too far.

512
00:37:03,309 --> 00:37:06,437
Where are you looking at?
Where are you looking? Eh?

513
00:37:06,521 --> 00:37:07,898
Look at your enemy.

514
00:37:07,981 --> 00:37:09,524
Change!

515
00:37:09,607 --> 00:37:14,404
<i>God... I want to be
seeing my mother again.</i>

516
00:37:14,487 --> 00:37:19,492
<i>Two-I-C is saying,
small-small we are winning this war.</i>

517
00:37:19,575 --> 00:37:24,164
<i>And then if you are willing,
I can be finding her again.</i>

518
00:37:25,456 --> 00:37:27,959
<i>But, only you know.</i>

519
00:37:31,046 --> 00:37:34,715
The National Reformation Council
took advantage of this instability

520
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,012
and militarily seized power
to restore UPC dominance.

521
00:37:39,095 --> 00:37:43,016
We NDF refuse to recognize
this illegitimate government.

522
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:44,224
Who are we?

523
00:37:44,225 --> 00:37:45,351
- Who are we?
- We are NDF.

524
00:37:45,435 --> 00:37:46,685
I said who are we?

525
00:37:46,686 --> 00:37:48,104
- I said who are we?
- We are NDF!

526
00:37:48,188 --> 00:37:51,524
<i>Our very own politicians,
who steal our resources</i>

527
00:37:51,607 --> 00:37:55,570
<i>and give them away for small-small dollar
in exchange for private pay-offs,</i>

528
00:37:55,653 --> 00:37:57,697
they are spit on the constitution!

529
00:37:57,781 --> 00:37:59,866
They are spit on your rights!

530
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:02,202
They are trying to spit on your future!

531
00:38:02,285 --> 00:38:03,995
I say, who is your Supreme Commandant?

532
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,288
Dada Goodblood!

533
00:38:05,371 --> 00:38:06,289
I say, who do you fight for?

534
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,410
- I say, who do you fight for?
- Dada Goodblood!

535
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:11,669
<i>In the battlefield,
you not be thinking normally.</i>

536
00:38:11,752 --> 00:38:12,587
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

537
00:38:12,587 --> 00:38:13,421
<i>- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir!</i>

538
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:17,258
<i>The only thing mattering
is the mission of the NDF!</i>

539
00:38:17,342 --> 00:38:18,176
Am I clear?

540
00:38:18,177 --> 00:38:19,219
- Am I clear?
- Yes, sir!

541
00:38:19,302 --> 00:38:20,761
- Soldiers, are you hearing me?
- Yes, sir!

542
00:38:20,846 --> 00:38:23,723
You fight and kill anyone
who destroys the peace.

543
00:38:23,807 --> 00:38:24,808
Yes, sir!

544
00:38:53,169 --> 00:38:56,882
Offside, offside! That's what I saw.
Offside, offside! Offside!

545
00:39:02,345 --> 00:39:03,721
Hey, stop it!

546
00:39:05,098 --> 00:39:06,432
All right, stop it!

547
00:39:13,064 --> 00:39:14,774
Native Defense Forces!

548
00:39:16,317 --> 00:39:18,027
How does your Commandant look?

549
00:39:18,028 --> 00:39:19,195
- How does your Commandant look?
- All right, sir!

550
00:39:19,279 --> 00:39:20,654
How does your Commandant look?

551
00:39:20,655 --> 00:39:22,949
- How does your Commandant look?
- All right, sir!

552
00:39:24,075 --> 00:39:30,373
What is it that has brought
this big family of strangers together?

553
00:39:31,624 --> 00:39:32,832
Was it fear?

554
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:34,044
- Was it fear?
- No, sir!

555
00:39:34,127 --> 00:39:35,086
Was it war?

556
00:39:35,086 --> 00:39:35,962
- Was it war?
- Yes, sir!

557
00:39:36,046 --> 00:39:38,965
We were defending ourselves.

558
00:39:39,049 --> 00:39:42,177
We have to get revenge. Huh?

559
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,636
We have been defending ourselves

560
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:47,515
against the killings and rapings
of our own people from the PLF

561
00:39:47,598 --> 00:39:50,185
and now from the NRC junta.

562
00:39:51,102 --> 00:39:54,730
But it has awakened a sleeping beast.

563
00:39:54,814 --> 00:39:57,150
It has awakened a giant.

564
00:39:57,233 --> 00:40:00,445
It has put the weapons of this war
back in the hands of you,

565
00:40:00,528 --> 00:40:04,615
the young and, therefore, the powerful.

566
00:40:05,783 --> 00:40:08,619
Young men! Wealth?

567
00:40:08,703 --> 00:40:12,748
We will not wait
to inherit any wealth. Huh?

568
00:40:12,832 --> 00:40:14,918
We will not wait for them
to come and give it to us.

569
00:40:15,001 --> 00:40:16,294
No, sir!

570
00:40:16,377 --> 00:40:18,753
We are going to take it.

571
00:40:18,754 --> 00:40:20,465
- We are going to take it.
- Yes, sir!

572
00:40:20,548 --> 00:40:21,840
We're going to take it from them.

573
00:40:21,841 --> 00:40:23,093
- We're going to take it from them.
- Yes, sir!

574
00:40:23,176 --> 00:40:24,052
Seize it!

575
00:40:24,053 --> 00:40:25,173
- Seize it!
- Yes, sir!

576
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,932
All of you that have
never been listened to before

577
00:40:29,015 --> 00:40:32,143
and have seen your family killed, huh,

578
00:40:32,227 --> 00:40:36,231
you now have something
that stands for you.

579
00:40:36,314 --> 00:40:38,483
You now have something
that stands for you!

580
00:40:39,734 --> 00:40:41,151
That is your defense.

581
00:40:41,152 --> 00:40:42,912
That is your defense.

582
00:40:43,488 --> 00:40:45,280
That is your family's blood.

583
00:40:45,281 --> 00:40:46,782
- That is your family's blood.
- Yes, sir!

584
00:40:46,866 --> 00:40:47,700
Victory!

585
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,618
- Victory!
- Victory!

586
00:40:48,701 --> 00:40:49,577
Victory!

587
00:40:49,577 --> 00:40:50,577
- Victory!
- Victory!

588
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,620
We are going to seize it!

589
00:40:51,621 --> 00:40:52,497
- We are going to seize it!
- Victory!

590
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,414
Victory!

591
00:40:53,415 --> 00:40:54,749
- Victory!
- Victory!

592
00:40:59,712 --> 00:41:01,839
You are my family.

593
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,738
You must die...

594
00:42:48,821 --> 00:42:50,448
before you are reborn.

595
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:29,862
The spirits have blessed you...

596
00:43:30,446 --> 00:43:33,449
and cleansed you.

597
00:43:33,533 --> 00:43:36,244
To the enemy, you are invincible.

598
00:43:37,995 --> 00:43:42,167
But there are rules we must follow...

599
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,294
to keep the spirits happy...

600
00:43:47,046 --> 00:43:49,215
to remain pure.

601
00:44:06,106 --> 00:44:08,693
Enemy never see you again!

602
00:44:08,776 --> 00:44:12,155
You are fortified!
You are fortified, eh?

603
00:44:13,614 --> 00:44:14,699
<i>Hey!</i>

604
00:44:18,077 --> 00:44:19,995
Our enjoyment is over.

605
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,373
Now it is time for war.
We are warring.

606
00:44:23,082 --> 00:44:25,585
We did enjoy our camp...

607
00:44:26,377 --> 00:44:29,589
but from here we are moving.

608
00:44:29,672 --> 00:44:33,968
Moving forward.
We are not to stay here.

609
00:44:35,094 --> 00:44:38,348
Don't be leaving anything
for the enemy to be using.

610
00:44:38,431 --> 00:44:40,641
We are going to burn it down.

611
00:44:42,893 --> 00:44:43,935
Am I clear?

612
00:44:43,936 --> 00:44:45,813
- Am I clear?
- Yes, sir!

613
00:44:45,896 --> 00:44:46,856
You are dismissed.

614
00:44:46,856 --> 00:44:47,773
- You are dismissed.
- Yes, sir. Thank you.

615
00:44:47,857 --> 00:44:49,316
COs dismissed!

616
00:44:49,317 --> 00:44:50,192
- COs dismissed!
- Thank you, sir.

617
00:44:50,276 --> 00:44:52,987
All of you, pack your weapons.
Be ready to move.

618
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:54,864
Moving out in one hour!

619
00:44:56,115 --> 00:44:58,200
Ah-ha!
Make sure this thing is burned.

620
00:44:58,284 --> 00:44:59,369
- The whole place!
- Yes, sir!

621
00:44:59,452 --> 00:45:01,537
Don't make me be
waiting for you, soldiers!

622
00:45:01,621 --> 00:45:03,301
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

623
00:45:08,711 --> 00:45:10,296
Got all of it?

624
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,715
We are leaving nothing for them to find.

625
00:45:25,478 --> 00:45:26,771
Burn it down!

626
00:45:26,854 --> 00:45:28,188
All of it!

627
00:45:48,709 --> 00:45:50,961
<i>Iron Jacket.
This is Supremo.</i>

628
00:45:51,045 --> 00:45:53,130
<i>You are loud, Supremo.</i>

629
00:45:53,213 --> 00:45:54,590
<i>Report.</i>

630
00:45:54,674 --> 00:45:56,926
<i>We are supplied
and moving. Over.</i>

631
00:45:57,009 --> 00:45:58,969
Make sure all the guns are clean.

632
00:45:59,053 --> 00:46:00,388
<i>Strike at your first opportunity.</i>

633
00:46:00,471 --> 00:46:01,806
They have been
buried for a long time.

634
00:46:01,889 --> 00:46:02,890
Make sure they work.

635
00:46:02,973 --> 00:46:04,934
<i>Seize supplies.
Map victories.</i>

636
00:46:05,017 --> 00:46:07,728
<i>This will keep the spirit up,
despite the UN embargo.</i>

637
00:46:07,812 --> 00:46:10,105
<i>Roger. Well copied, sir.</i>

638
00:46:10,189 --> 00:46:12,525
<i>Our fight is a just one.</i>

639
00:46:12,608 --> 00:46:16,278
<i>Being a freedom fighter is discipline,
obedience and loyalty.</i>

640
00:46:16,362 --> 00:46:17,363
<i>Roger.</i>

641
00:46:17,447 --> 00:46:20,741
<i>We remain ever loyal to Supreme HQ, sir.</i>

642
00:46:20,825 --> 00:46:23,369
<i>Standing by for future orders. Over.</i>

643
00:46:23,453 --> 00:46:27,039
<i>Keep moving. Keep fighting.
Over and out.</i>

644
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:30,460
This here.
This is the route where we are now.

645
00:46:30,543 --> 00:46:32,920
Listen. From here, we must go down.

646
00:46:33,003 --> 00:46:34,254
And wait by that road there.

647
00:46:34,339 --> 00:46:35,881
Because I think something
is coming across there.

648
00:46:35,965 --> 00:46:37,132
Yes, sir.

649
00:46:51,731 --> 00:46:53,566
Move. Move!

650
00:46:59,196 --> 00:47:01,281
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Agu! Agu!

651
00:47:01,366 --> 00:47:03,368
Come. Come.

652
00:47:04,994 --> 00:47:05,995
Hey!

653
00:47:07,747 --> 00:47:12,460
Hey! Why? Where do you go?
Come over! Fuck! Fly!

654
00:47:37,109 --> 00:47:38,629
Preacher, give me the ganja.

655
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,408
Hey, hey.

656
00:47:57,588 --> 00:48:00,299
Agu, you know,
ambush rule number one, no noise.

657
00:48:00,382 --> 00:48:03,469
You keep quiet.
Keep very quiet.

658
00:48:03,553 --> 00:48:06,013
If even a snake bite your legs,
you keep quiet.

659
00:48:06,096 --> 00:48:07,389
You get hit, you keep quiet.

660
00:48:07,473 --> 00:48:10,059
What is the rule number one in ambush?

661
00:48:10,142 --> 00:48:12,186
No talking,
even if snake is biting you.

662
00:48:12,269 --> 00:48:14,021
Okay.

663
00:48:14,104 --> 00:48:17,357
You talk, enemies come around,
we all go die.

664
00:48:18,317 --> 00:48:19,485
Right.

665
00:48:22,988 --> 00:48:24,949
Psst! Psst! Enemies.

666
00:48:29,745 --> 00:48:33,332
They are coming.
Everybody, be quiet. They are coming.

667
00:49:22,339 --> 00:49:23,591
Get ready.

668
00:49:25,843 --> 00:49:27,386
Go, go, go.

669
00:49:32,432 --> 00:49:33,768
RPG! RPG!

670
00:49:48,032 --> 00:49:50,535
Agu! Ammo!

671
00:49:51,451 --> 00:49:53,078
Ammo!

672
00:49:53,704 --> 00:49:55,790
Hey, you! Go!
Cut them off!

673
00:49:56,666 --> 00:49:57,958
Where's the fucking ammo?

674
00:50:02,004 --> 00:50:03,505
...fire!

675
00:50:03,589 --> 00:50:05,550
Cease fire!

676
00:50:05,633 --> 00:50:07,384
Cease fire!

677
00:50:08,594 --> 00:50:11,764
Agu! My ammo box!

678
00:50:11,847 --> 00:50:13,558
You want me to die?

679
00:50:24,694 --> 00:50:27,071
Search this vehicle.
Search all the vehicles.

680
00:50:27,154 --> 00:50:27,988
Yes, sir!

681
00:50:27,989 --> 00:50:29,589
- Yes, sir!
- I want them disarmed.

682
00:50:29,615 --> 00:50:31,617
I want them disrobed.

683
00:50:31,701 --> 00:50:35,788
I want this victory mapped.
Map them. Map this victory.

684
00:50:35,871 --> 00:50:36,996
Controller, map them!

685
00:50:36,997 --> 00:50:38,874
- Controller, map them!
- Yes, sir!

686
00:50:38,958 --> 00:50:42,169
This vehicle, all the bodies,
I want them pockets searched.

687
00:50:43,462 --> 00:50:47,507
All of it! Search them good-good.

688
00:50:54,306 --> 00:50:55,140
Pack it up.

689
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:55,975
- Pack it up.
- Sir.

690
00:50:56,058 --> 00:50:57,309
Ah-ha!

691
00:50:57,392 --> 00:50:59,061
Go and bring me my charge.

692
00:50:59,144 --> 00:51:00,187
Agu!

693
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:01,437
Sir! I find this.

694
00:51:01,438 --> 00:51:02,481
- Sir! I find this.
- Why don't you open it?

695
00:51:02,564 --> 00:51:03,983
I find this.

696
00:51:04,066 --> 00:51:05,275
Oh!

697
00:51:06,151 --> 00:51:07,444
Uh-huh.

698
00:51:10,865 --> 00:51:11,907
Yes.

699
00:51:11,991 --> 00:51:13,075
Agu!

700
00:51:16,578 --> 00:51:17,705
Where is he?

701
00:51:17,788 --> 00:51:18,873
Agu!

702
00:51:20,834 --> 00:51:22,594
Go shut your fucking mouth.

703
00:51:26,421 --> 00:51:27,715
Yes, sir!

704
00:51:29,884 --> 00:51:31,343
Agu, you are going to kill this man.

705
00:51:31,426 --> 00:51:34,429
Please.
I'm supposed to be fixing the bridges.

706
00:51:34,513 --> 00:51:35,793
You are going to kill him today.

707
00:51:35,848 --> 00:51:37,391
I not be a soldier.
Please, sir.

708
00:51:37,933 --> 00:51:41,812
I'm an engineering student
from the university in the capital.

709
00:51:41,896 --> 00:51:43,313
I'm supposed to be
fixing the bridges,

710
00:51:43,397 --> 00:51:46,191
- not be a...
- Shut up!

711
00:51:46,275 --> 00:51:47,359
Shut your mouth.

712
00:51:47,442 --> 00:51:50,362
Pass me something for this guy.

713
00:51:51,906 --> 00:51:53,407
- Nah, that's too big.
- It will be cutlass.

714
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:54,825
Yeah, I see.

715
00:51:54,909 --> 00:51:55,910
Does he have strength for this?

716
00:51:55,993 --> 00:51:59,830
Yeah, he is strong. You can do it.
Preacher, put him on his ass.

717
00:52:01,666 --> 00:52:04,001
Put him on his ass! On his ass!

718
00:52:04,084 --> 00:52:05,377
Agu, come.

719
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:10,132
So when you are chopping wood,
lift up high-high. Up, high.

720
00:52:10,215 --> 00:52:11,341
Uh-huh!

721
00:52:11,425 --> 00:52:17,639
Then when you are ready,
you come down so well-well into the flesh.

722
00:52:17,723 --> 00:52:18,890
You have chopped melon before? Melon?

723
00:52:18,891 --> 00:52:19,809
- You have chopped melon before? Melon?
- Please, no.

724
00:52:19,892 --> 00:52:20,726
Well, this is not a melon.

725
00:52:20,726 --> 00:52:21,560
- Well, this is not a melon.
- Please, no.

726
00:52:21,643 --> 00:52:25,147
I said shut your mouth, huh?
Shut your mouth.

727
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:29,568
You are making it hard.
This is hard.

728
00:52:29,651 --> 00:52:32,404
It's hard,
so you must split him good.

729
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:37,451
Huh? Agu, these are the ones
that killed your father.

730
00:52:38,035 --> 00:52:39,078
Huh?

731
00:52:39,161 --> 00:52:39,995
Go on.

732
00:52:39,995 --> 00:52:40,995
Go on.

733
00:52:43,123 --> 00:52:44,207
Shut up!

734
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:45,808
- Shut up!
- Please. Please.

735
00:52:46,626 --> 00:52:48,003
Agu, go on.

736
00:52:49,671 --> 00:52:50,798
Agu!

737
00:52:52,257 --> 00:52:54,051
Please, no.

738
00:52:54,134 --> 00:52:55,344
Chop him good-good.

739
00:52:55,427 --> 00:52:57,512
Please!

740
00:52:58,055 --> 00:53:01,516
These are the ones,
the dogs that kill your father.

741
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,185
Where is your mother?

742
00:53:03,268 --> 00:53:04,644
Please...

743
00:53:04,729 --> 00:53:07,606
Agu, these are the ones
that killed your father!

744
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:10,400
Chop that head!

745
00:53:12,277 --> 00:53:13,570
Chop him!

746
00:53:19,785 --> 00:53:21,411
Agu, come on!

747
00:53:22,788 --> 00:53:23,956
Ahh!

748
00:53:29,336 --> 00:53:31,296
Strika, help your brotha.

749
00:54:10,544 --> 00:54:12,337
Good.

750
00:54:14,173 --> 00:54:15,340
That's right.

751
00:54:15,424 --> 00:54:16,466
Watch his blood.

752
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:19,178
That is what you call justice. Hmm.

753
00:54:19,261 --> 00:54:22,932
<i>God... I have killed a man.</i>

754
00:54:25,184 --> 00:54:27,812
<i>It is the worst sin...</i>

755
00:54:27,895 --> 00:54:30,147
<i>but I am knowing too,</i>

756
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:32,858
<i>it is the right thing to be doing.</i>

757
00:54:32,942 --> 00:54:33,775
Tripod!

758
00:54:33,775 --> 00:54:34,609
- Tripod!
- Yes, sir.

759
00:54:34,693 --> 00:54:36,486
This will be the Commandant's car.

760
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:39,531
Take this fucker out.
He is filthy.

761
00:54:39,614 --> 00:54:42,326
Two-I-C! Two-I-C!

762
00:54:44,203 --> 00:54:46,455
Give this to my charge. Huh?

763
00:54:48,082 --> 00:54:49,958
This will be the Commandant's car.

764
00:54:49,959 --> 00:54:51,418
- This will be the Commandant's car.
- Yes, sir.

765
00:54:51,501 --> 00:54:54,338
If you are losing it,
then I am losing you.

766
00:54:56,048 --> 00:54:57,132
Hmm!

767
00:54:59,093 --> 00:55:00,094
Uh-huh.

768
00:55:00,845 --> 00:55:02,096
This...

769
00:55:03,347 --> 00:55:04,639
- You are driving?
- Okay to move out.

770
00:55:04,723 --> 00:55:07,101
Everyone, get ready to move out.

771
00:55:07,184 --> 00:55:09,019
Get ready to move out, Agu.

772
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,553
You got this stuff from where?

773
00:55:46,473 --> 00:55:47,975
From dead bodies?

774
00:55:55,649 --> 00:55:59,444
Everybody is calling you "Strika." Why?

775
00:56:05,617 --> 00:56:07,077
Are you liking war?

776
00:56:09,579 --> 00:56:12,166
Hey, I'm asking you a question,
and you are not talking.

777
00:56:15,044 --> 00:56:16,795
Are you having family?

778
00:56:27,472 --> 00:56:30,017
I am thinking about my mom...

779
00:56:33,395 --> 00:56:34,854
my brother...

780
00:56:37,399 --> 00:56:39,859
and my little sister.

781
00:56:58,503 --> 00:56:59,921
Are you stupid?

782
00:57:03,258 --> 00:57:05,177
Why are you not talking?

783
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,980
I am asking a question.
You are not talking.

784
00:57:40,087 --> 00:57:42,006
Go! Go! Fast!

785
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:56,478
Go! Go, go!

786
00:57:59,189 --> 00:58:02,317
I got you, Strika.

787
00:58:34,433 --> 00:58:35,350
Where is he?

788
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:36,185
- Where is he?
- Keep going, keep going.

789
00:58:36,268 --> 00:58:39,271
Grass cutter! Grass cutter!
Grass cutter!

790
00:58:39,354 --> 00:58:40,480
Left, left, left.

791
00:59:19,936 --> 00:59:23,148
And you're having
any food that you want,

792
00:59:23,232 --> 00:59:26,776
from chicken, cow,
fruit and vegetable...

793
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:31,448
Any kind of fish that you want, we got.
The fisherman is bringing it from the sea.

794
00:59:31,531 --> 00:59:33,617
There's nothing you cannot have there.

795
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:39,873
And the best thing of this place,
this town of abundant resources,

796
00:59:39,956 --> 00:59:42,376
is the women.

797
00:59:42,459 --> 00:59:47,422
Hey, the women are too beautiful there!
Too beautiful.

798
00:59:47,506 --> 00:59:50,925
Ah! The next thing you know, your soldier
will be standing to attention.

799
00:59:54,053 --> 00:59:57,807
They are having bottoms
with specifications so nice

800
00:59:57,891 --> 01:00:02,354
that the ground where they're sitting down
is also rejoicing.

801
01:00:02,437 --> 01:00:07,151
And they know...
they know how to be treating a man.

802
01:00:07,234 --> 01:00:11,363
How to make him feel good,
kisses and all that, huh?

803
01:00:11,446 --> 01:00:14,366
Last time I was there,
my soldier was hurting.

804
01:00:14,449 --> 01:00:15,450
I couldn't stand up, eh!

805
01:00:17,702 --> 01:00:22,249
But you will see
because you are going there yourselves.

806
01:00:22,332 --> 01:00:23,333
Hmm?

807
01:00:23,417 --> 01:00:25,960
You will see with
your own eyes, gentlemen.

808
01:00:26,044 --> 01:00:27,629
Mmm-hmm.

809
01:00:31,049 --> 01:00:32,217
Commandant, sir!

810
01:00:35,512 --> 01:00:36,595
Who is this?

811
01:00:36,596 --> 01:00:38,765
- Who is this?
- Refugees from the village, sir.

812
01:00:38,848 --> 01:00:42,477
They said the PLF and the NRC
took their village three days ago.

813
01:00:42,561 --> 01:00:44,896
They killed most of the town,
but they let these ones go.

814
01:00:44,979 --> 01:00:46,231
Hmm.

815
01:00:50,277 --> 01:00:53,280
Well, let us be giving
their village back, huh?

816
01:00:53,363 --> 01:00:54,656
Yes, sir.

817
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:05,417
Look at that.

818
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,794
They are cutting people's hands.

819
01:01:09,087 --> 01:01:10,672
Fucking PLF.

820
01:01:37,699 --> 01:01:38,741
Radio!

821
01:01:38,742 --> 01:01:40,022
- Radio!
- Yes, sir.

822
01:01:44,414 --> 01:01:46,039
Two-I-C!

823
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,501
- Two-I-C!
- <i>Roger, you are loud.</i>

824
01:01:47,584 --> 01:01:48,835
Report!

825
01:01:48,918 --> 01:01:52,005
<i>Uh, we are facing heavy fire, sir. Over.</i>

826
01:01:52,088 --> 01:01:53,298
Can you take the bridge?

827
01:01:53,382 --> 01:01:55,717
It's very difficult, sir.
Men are fighting bravely,

828
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,177
but I don't know if we can
hold too much longer. Over.

829
01:01:58,262 --> 01:01:59,303
<i>Press on!</i>

830
01:01:59,304 --> 01:02:00,847
<i>- Press on!</i>
- Roger. We need support, sir.

831
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:02,474
Some of our men are injured.

832
01:02:02,557 --> 01:02:06,436
<i>The men's spirits are low.
Sir, do you copy?</i>

833
01:02:06,895 --> 01:02:07,729
Sir?

834
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:09,814
- Sir?
- <i>Can you take the bridge?</i>

835
01:02:09,898 --> 01:02:14,236
Copy, sir. We will reapply pressure
and push for the bridge. Over.

836
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:15,612
<i>Take the bridge!</i>

837
01:02:15,695 --> 01:02:17,280
That is your task! Mortar.

838
01:02:17,281 --> 01:02:18,114
- That is your task! Mortar.
- Yes, sir!

839
01:02:18,197 --> 01:02:19,657
Your ammo now!

840
01:02:19,658 --> 01:02:21,826
- Your ammo now!
- Ammunition ready, sir!

841
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:23,245
Stand by!

842
01:02:33,588 --> 01:02:35,340
Agu and Strika.

843
01:02:35,424 --> 01:02:36,591
Yes, sir!

844
01:02:36,675 --> 01:02:42,013
See this thing, huh?
This is a very special device.

845
01:02:42,096 --> 01:02:47,269
We can be seeing the enemy
even when the enemy is hiding.

846
01:02:47,352 --> 01:02:49,521
Come.

847
01:02:49,604 --> 01:02:51,398
Wait, Strika.

848
01:02:54,484 --> 01:02:59,489
Ah! There you go. See our guys.
Look, we are taking them.

849
01:03:01,325 --> 01:03:03,117
You see?

850
01:03:06,162 --> 01:03:07,289
Fire!

851
01:03:16,881 --> 01:03:17,716
See that?

852
01:03:17,716 --> 01:03:18,633
- See that?
- Yeah.

853
01:03:18,717 --> 01:03:21,260
That is magic. Huh?

854
01:03:24,097 --> 01:03:26,140
We want to take that bridge.

855
01:03:27,016 --> 01:03:29,478
Now we are going to
take that bridge.

856
01:03:33,315 --> 01:03:34,773
Formation!

857
01:03:34,774 --> 01:03:35,984
- Formation!
- Formation!

858
01:03:36,067 --> 01:03:37,777
That bridge, we are taking it!

859
01:03:37,861 --> 01:03:38,862
Yes, sir.

860
01:03:41,448 --> 01:03:44,659
Better look me in the eyes,
motherfucker.

861
01:03:44,743 --> 01:03:47,329
Who wants to fight?
Uh-huh.

862
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:50,624
I'm only taking the brave!

863
01:03:50,707 --> 01:03:53,042
I'm not taking the scared.

864
01:03:54,461 --> 01:03:58,382
I'm not taking no girls.

865
01:03:58,465 --> 01:03:59,673
Are you ready to fight?

866
01:03:59,674 --> 01:04:00,509
- Are you ready to fight?
- Yes, sir!

867
01:04:00,592 --> 01:04:01,468
Are you ready to fight?

868
01:04:01,469 --> 01:04:03,302
- Are you ready to fight?
- Yes, sir!

869
01:04:03,387 --> 01:04:04,512
You want to take that bridge?

870
01:04:04,513 --> 01:04:05,764
- You want to take that bridge?
- Yes, sir!

871
01:04:05,847 --> 01:04:07,097
We're gonna take that fucking bridge?

872
01:04:07,098 --> 01:04:09,338
- We're gonna take that fucking bridge?
- Yes, sir!

873
01:05:16,668 --> 01:05:17,669
Fucking PLF!

874
01:05:18,252 --> 01:05:20,547
Fucking PLF!

875
01:05:21,214 --> 01:05:22,255
No retreat!

876
01:05:22,256 --> 01:05:23,633
- No retreat!
- No surrender!

877
01:05:23,717 --> 01:05:24,593
No retreat!

878
01:05:24,594 --> 01:05:25,714
- No retreat!
- No surrender!

879
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,637
We're moving!

880
01:05:27,721 --> 01:05:29,222
We're moving!

881
01:05:29,305 --> 01:05:31,475
- No retreat!
- No surrender!

882
01:05:31,558 --> 01:05:33,643
We're moving!

883
01:05:42,026 --> 01:05:43,110
No retreat!

884
01:05:43,111 --> 01:05:45,671
- No retreat!
- No surrender!

885
01:06:17,145 --> 01:06:18,705
- Move it!
- Move it!

886
01:06:27,864 --> 01:06:29,699
Move it! Move it!

887
01:06:39,543 --> 01:06:41,586
Move it!

888
01:07:19,749 --> 01:07:23,127
Our Father,
from dust we were created.

889
01:07:23,211 --> 01:07:24,879
We shall go back to dust.

890
01:07:24,963 --> 01:07:26,673
Eleven of my men. Gone.

891
01:07:26,756 --> 01:07:29,759
I commit my fellow soldiers
into your hands.

892
01:07:29,843 --> 01:07:32,887
May their soul rest in peace. Amen.

893
01:07:34,889 --> 01:07:38,602
<i>I am now knowing
the smell of the dead.</i>

894
01:07:38,685 --> 01:07:40,604
<i>They are sweet like sugarcane</i>

895
01:07:41,563 --> 01:07:44,733
<i>and rotten like palm wine.</i>

896
01:07:44,816 --> 01:07:50,905
<i>And when they stay in the sun, they are
growing plump like brown mangoes.</i>

897
01:08:05,587 --> 01:08:06,713
Very true, sir.

898
01:08:06,796 --> 01:08:07,797
Strika.

899
01:08:18,933 --> 01:08:20,476
What?

900
01:08:20,559 --> 01:08:22,937
<i>You have your next mission. Stand by.</i>

901
01:08:23,021 --> 01:08:24,856
You are loud, Supremo.

902
01:08:24,939 --> 01:08:27,734
<i>Capture the central regions,
capital city, Bov.</i>

903
01:08:27,817 --> 01:08:28,860
<i>When you accomplish that,</i>

904
01:08:28,943 --> 01:08:32,030
<i>I will promulgate an order
making you Brigadier General.</i>

905
01:08:32,113 --> 01:08:35,324
<i>You'll be a general before
we finally seize the capital city.</i>

906
01:08:35,408 --> 01:08:37,243
Yes, sir.
It is a challenge, sir.

907
01:08:37,326 --> 01:08:40,747
But I promise you,
it's mission possible. Over.

908
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:42,550
<i>Well, then, next time I see you,</i>

909
01:08:42,581 --> 01:08:44,167
<i>I'll be speaking to a general.</i>

910
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:47,128
<i>And how is your Two-I-C performing? Over.</i>

911
01:08:47,211 --> 01:08:50,048
Two-I-C? Sorry, sir.
What do you mean "Two-I-C"?

912
01:08:50,131 --> 01:08:51,800
<i>I've always rated
that young man.</i>

913
01:08:51,883 --> 01:08:54,761
Well, Two-I-C is
a formidable soldier.

914
01:08:54,844 --> 01:08:56,137
Over.

915
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:58,431
<i>Teach him
the ways of a good commander.</i>

916
01:08:58,514 --> 01:08:59,557
Yes, sir.

917
01:08:59,641 --> 01:09:01,685
<i>Now, take Bov.
Keep that spirit up,</i>

918
01:09:01,768 --> 01:09:03,436
<i>and bring us closer to victory.</i>

919
01:09:03,519 --> 01:09:05,689
Of course, Supremo. Over.

920
01:09:05,772 --> 01:09:08,942
<i>You want to be a general,
don't you, Commandant?</i>

921
01:09:09,025 --> 01:09:10,108
Yes, sir.

922
01:09:10,109 --> 01:09:11,610
- Yes, sir.
- <i>Earn it. Over and out.</i>

923
01:09:11,695 --> 01:09:13,321
Over and out.

924
01:09:14,989 --> 01:09:17,074
Agu, you fought well today.

925
01:09:17,075 --> 01:09:18,915
- Agu, you fought well today.
- Thank you, sir.

926
01:09:19,493 --> 01:09:22,413
A-ha! What is this?

927
01:09:23,873 --> 01:09:25,041
Ah!

928
01:09:26,584 --> 01:09:28,336
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

929
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:34,843
Agu, you are wanting to
be knowing how to be leading?

930
01:09:34,926 --> 01:09:37,385
I am happy to be following you, sir.

931
01:09:37,386 --> 01:09:38,387
- I am happy to be following you, sir.
- That is good,

932
01:09:38,471 --> 01:09:43,226
because there is no learning
how to be leading.

933
01:09:43,309 --> 01:09:46,771
Some people are born to be leaders,
others are born to be followers,

934
01:09:46,855 --> 01:09:49,733
and others are just waiting to be dying.

935
01:09:49,816 --> 01:09:51,524
I'm a good follower, sir.

936
01:09:51,525 --> 01:09:53,069
- I'm a good follower, sir.
- Agu, you are different.

937
01:09:53,152 --> 01:09:55,905
You are reminding me of
when I was a small boy.

938
01:09:55,989 --> 01:09:59,743
That is how I know
you are going to be a leader.

939
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:02,829
You see, even the best leader

940
01:10:02,912 --> 01:10:07,083
sometimes he must be knowing
how to be a follower.

941
01:10:08,209 --> 01:10:10,128
Ah, even me.

942
01:10:10,211 --> 01:10:16,425
I am following the Supreme Commandant,
even if I am not agreeing.

943
01:10:17,761 --> 01:10:18,887
Huh?

944
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:22,098
Yes, sir.
I'm a good follower.

945
01:10:24,433 --> 01:10:26,394
You are seeing this place?

946
01:10:27,103 --> 01:10:30,523
The Commandant is saying
we must take this.

947
01:10:30,606 --> 01:10:31,733
That it is important.

948
01:10:31,816 --> 01:10:36,070
So, hmm, if it is important to him,
it is important to me.

949
01:10:36,154 --> 01:10:37,446
Yes, sir.

950
01:10:39,073 --> 01:10:42,118
Because if we get that,
then we can go to Taro.

951
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,253
That is where your mother is, eh?

952
01:10:53,254 --> 01:10:55,614
- That is where your mother is, eh?
- She is in the capital.

953
01:10:56,925 --> 01:10:59,677
Come, Agu.

954
01:10:59,761 --> 01:11:02,263
After we've been greeted
by Dada Goodblood,

955
01:11:02,346 --> 01:11:05,016
we'll be taking the capital certainly.

956
01:11:09,312 --> 01:11:11,439
Come.

957
01:11:17,779 --> 01:11:20,406
This one has special juju.

958
01:11:20,489 --> 01:11:21,699
Thank you, sir.

959
01:11:21,783 --> 01:11:25,286
You see, I've been wanting to help you
more than the others, Agu,

960
01:11:25,369 --> 01:11:29,582
but you cannot be telling the others
how I'm helping you like this.

961
01:11:29,665 --> 01:11:31,750
It'll have to be our secret.

962
01:11:32,585 --> 01:11:34,169
You are knowing how to keep secret?

963
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:35,004
- You are knowing how to keep secret?
- Yes, sir.

964
01:11:35,088 --> 01:11:36,713
Well, be saying it.

965
01:11:36,714 --> 01:11:39,092
- Well, be saying it.
- I can be keeping this secret, sir.

966
01:11:50,353 --> 01:11:53,898
I'm not punishing you, Agu.
Mmm?

967
01:11:54,941 --> 01:11:57,151
But I do care for you.

968
01:12:16,087 --> 01:12:17,255
Aye.

969
01:12:19,715 --> 01:12:21,300
Agu, kneel down.

970
01:12:29,017 --> 01:12:34,105
Be doing this thing... for me.

971
01:13:27,701 --> 01:13:30,141
They are jumping like rabbits.

972
01:13:31,412 --> 01:13:33,998
Move, move to your left.

973
01:13:39,170 --> 01:13:40,588
- Go, go. Keep going.
- Go. Keep going.

974
01:13:40,671 --> 01:13:42,048
- Keep going.
- Move, move.

975
01:13:42,131 --> 01:13:44,217
To your left side.

976
01:13:48,346 --> 01:13:49,430
Agu.

977
01:13:51,474 --> 01:13:53,184
Agu?

978
01:13:53,267 --> 01:13:56,770
I don't want that I call you
and you just stand there. Agu?

979
01:13:58,897 --> 01:14:00,316
Come here,
I'll give you some brown-brown.

980
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:03,361
It'll cure everything for you, eh.

981
01:14:03,945 --> 01:14:06,780
Hey, I didn't call you to stand there.

982
01:14:09,951 --> 01:14:11,035
Hmm?

983
01:14:12,536 --> 01:14:16,665
My boy, what is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?

984
01:14:17,916 --> 01:14:20,211
Come here,
I'll give you some morale booster.

985
01:14:20,294 --> 01:14:23,672
I think I'll give you
that brown-brown, so...

986
01:14:23,756 --> 01:14:27,801
Morale booster, you know.
Come, come. Here.

987
01:14:30,763 --> 01:14:32,473
Yeah, that my boy.

988
01:14:32,556 --> 01:14:35,309
Yeah. Morale booster, eh?

989
01:14:35,393 --> 01:14:37,520
Make you strong.

990
01:14:37,603 --> 01:14:39,397
More protection.

991
01:14:41,315 --> 01:14:44,443
<i>Nobody is your friend
where we are going.</i>

992
01:14:45,486 --> 01:14:47,655
<i>They are the enemy.</i>

993
01:14:47,738 --> 01:14:51,409
<i>They are the farmers
that have fed the enemy.</i>

994
01:14:51,492 --> 01:14:53,286
- <i>The farmers' wives whose breasts...</i>
- Agu. Agu.

995
01:14:53,369 --> 01:14:54,828
<i>...have been feeding babies.</i>

996
01:14:54,912 --> 01:14:56,664
<i>Agu.</i>

997
01:14:56,747 --> 01:15:00,126
That is the nature
of the land that we are going.

998
01:15:00,209 --> 01:15:03,504
The collaborators and the traitors.

999
01:15:04,338 --> 01:15:06,840
<i>Our people's blood
has been flowing for years.</i>

1000
01:15:06,924 --> 01:15:10,344
<i>That's why it is time
for their blood to flow.</i>

1001
01:15:10,428 --> 01:15:13,681
<i>We will spare nobody.</i>

1002
01:15:13,764 --> 01:15:15,891
We'll spare nobody,

1003
01:15:15,974 --> 01:15:19,645
because they are all enemy,
all of them!

1004
01:15:21,689 --> 01:15:22,773
Let us pray.

1005
01:15:25,484 --> 01:15:27,528
God, let us pray.

1006
01:15:29,072 --> 01:15:32,658
<i>He is guiding us with
what we are about to be doing.</i>

1007
01:15:32,741 --> 01:15:34,243
<i>He is helping us.</i>

1008
01:15:35,953 --> 01:15:38,081
<i>Let us fulfill your justice.</i>

1009
01:15:40,624 --> 01:15:42,418
<i>Give us the strength!</i>

1010
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:47,506
<i>God, we will be sacrificing our blood!</i>

1011
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:50,676
<i>That is why we must spare nobody!</i>

1012
01:15:50,759 --> 01:15:53,554
<i>We will spare nobody!</i>

1013
01:15:53,637 --> 01:15:55,139
<i>Nothing will hurt us.</i>

1014
01:15:58,976 --> 01:16:03,064
<i>Because we are invincible.
We are invincible!</i>

1015
01:16:10,904 --> 01:16:13,949
NDF! NDF!

1016
01:16:14,032 --> 01:16:15,409
- Who are we?

1020
01:16:42,645 --> 01:16:44,980
NDF, spare nobody!

1021
01:16:45,689 --> 01:16:46,814
Kill them all!

1022
01:16:46,815 --> 01:16:48,255
Kill them all!

1023
01:16:56,867 --> 01:16:59,287
Come on, move, NDF!
Move, move! Move!

1024
01:17:21,267 --> 01:17:22,143
<i>How the Commandant look?</i>

1025
01:17:22,143 --> 01:17:23,101
<i>- How the Commandant look?
- All right, sir!</i>

1026
01:17:23,186 --> 01:17:24,061

<i>- I say, how the Commandant look?

<i>Agu!</i>

1038
01:17:45,333 --> 01:17:48,294
Shoot them! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!

1039
01:17:54,217 --> 01:17:56,385
Commandant! Sir!

1040
01:17:56,469 --> 01:17:58,346
Leave this one under my charge.

1041
01:17:58,429 --> 01:18:00,348
I will be training him to be a warrior.

1042
01:18:00,431 --> 01:18:01,932

Move, move!
Move, move, move! Move!

01:18:37,092 --> 01:18:38,219
Fuck!

Fuck you! Fucker! Fucker!

Fuck, fuck, fuck!

Out, out. Over here.

1062

Fucking out! Fucking out! Out!

1063

Fucking out! Out! Get up!
Get up, fuck! Get up! Up!

1064
01:19:31,897 --> 01:19:33,566
Ma... Ma!

1065
01:19:33,649 --> 01:19:34,775
I'm not your mother!

1066
01:19:35,734 --> 01:19:36,944
I'm not your mother!

1067
01:19:37,027 --> 01:19:38,321
I found you!

1068
01:19:38,987 --> 01:19:41,449
What the fuck going on here?

1069
01:19:41,532 --> 01:19:43,200
You know her?

1070
01:19:43,284 --> 01:19:44,952
I was looking for you!

1071
01:19:45,035 --> 01:19:48,372
Where do you
know this woman from? You know her?

1072
01:19:48,456 --> 01:19:49,665
I was looking for you!

1073
01:19:49,748 --> 01:19:51,875
I wanna rape her.

1074
01:19:53,043 --> 01:19:54,843
I wanna rape her!

1075
01:19:57,130 --> 01:19:58,799
You're not my mother!

1076
01:19:58,882 --> 01:20:00,968
Witch woman!

1077
01:20:01,051 --> 01:20:03,095
You're not my mother! You fooled me!

1078
01:20:03,178 --> 01:20:04,513
Witch woman!

1079
01:20:38,339 --> 01:20:42,551
<i>God...
are you watching what we are doing?</i>

1080
01:20:45,846 --> 01:20:48,056
Oh! Why? Shit!

1081
01:20:50,559 --> 01:20:52,395
What the fuck is that?

1082
01:20:53,354 --> 01:20:57,149
You didn't fucking boy, eh?
You didn't fucking, boy.

1083
01:21:28,389 --> 01:21:31,684
You here for die, motherfucker.

1084
01:21:33,644 --> 01:21:38,524
Fuck him up, eh?
Fuck you up. Fuck you up.

1085
01:21:46,364 --> 01:21:48,951
Commandant, sir.
This is for you, sir.

1086
01:21:56,792 --> 01:22:00,003
From the Supreme Commander.
What does it say?

1087
01:22:09,972 --> 01:22:12,057
Now it is your turn to eat.

1088
01:22:16,144 --> 01:22:17,813
Load the vehicles.

1089
01:22:19,565 --> 01:22:21,567
He is summoning us.

1090
01:22:25,571 --> 01:22:27,405
Did he state a reason?

1091
01:22:28,574 --> 01:22:30,117
Isn't it clear?

1092
01:22:34,121 --> 01:22:35,038
Are we going to Taro?

1093
01:22:35,039 --> 01:22:36,479
Are we going to Taro?

1094
01:22:36,999 --> 01:22:39,251
This guy!

1095
01:22:39,334 --> 01:22:41,169
You can't see my ears?

1096
01:22:44,465 --> 01:22:46,216
What is happening to this one?

1097
01:22:46,299 --> 01:22:48,844
A piece of RPG
is hitting his temple.

1098
01:22:48,927 --> 01:22:50,596
I beg you, please, don't shoot me!
Please!

1099
01:22:50,679 --> 01:22:52,138
Hey, keep your eyes down!

1100
01:22:52,139 --> 01:22:53,015
- Hey, keep your eyes down!
- Oi! Oi! Oi!

1101
01:22:53,098 --> 01:22:55,017
What do we do
with the civilians?

1102
01:22:56,018 --> 01:22:57,060
Leave one of them alive.

1103
01:22:57,144 --> 01:23:00,814
Send him up north to the next village
and then the next village after that.

1104
01:23:00,898 --> 01:23:03,734
Tell them that we are coming.
It's only the beginning.

1105
01:23:03,817 --> 01:23:04,818
Get on board, everybody.

1106
01:23:04,902 --> 01:23:06,069
- Tripod!
- Yes, sir.

1107
01:23:06,153 --> 01:23:10,908
Take note and act accordingly.
Strika and Agu are now part of my squad.

1108
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:12,785
Mountain View. Iron Jacket. Over.

1109
01:23:12,868 --> 01:23:14,495
Get in there now! Move!

1110
01:23:14,578 --> 01:23:16,997
We are proceeding to Taro
with arms. Over!

1111
01:23:19,833 --> 01:23:20,668
Get in!

1112
01:23:20,669 --> 01:23:22,335
- Get in!
<i>- Okay. Roger.</i>

1113
01:23:22,419 --> 01:23:24,797
Echo, tango, alpha, 1800 hours.

1114
01:23:39,562 --> 01:23:40,687
Tripod!

1115
01:23:40,688 --> 01:23:41,522
- Tripod!
- Yes, sir!

1116
01:23:41,605 --> 01:23:43,273
Guns up!

1117
01:24:02,084 --> 01:24:04,211
Halt! Halt!

1118
01:24:05,045 --> 01:24:06,254
- Enemy or friend?
- Friend!

1119
01:24:06,338 --> 01:24:07,840
- Who are you?
- NDF!

1120
01:24:15,263 --> 01:24:16,974
Who is your commander?

1121
01:24:17,057 --> 01:24:18,851
I am.

1122
01:24:18,934 --> 01:24:21,812
What kind of welcome is this?

1123
01:24:21,895 --> 01:24:24,857
Sorry, sir. You, get in that car.
Take them to HQ.

1124
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:26,984
Clear the way!

1125
01:24:27,067 --> 01:24:28,401
Clear the fuckin' way!

1126
01:24:32,489 --> 01:24:34,867
Right this way.
Right this way.

1127
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:39,663
Fuck you!

1128
01:24:52,259 --> 01:24:56,054
Victory! Victory! Victory!

1129
01:25:28,671 --> 01:25:30,672
Commandant, welcome.

1130
01:25:30,673 --> 01:25:31,715
- Commandant, welcome.
- Hello, Deputy.

1131
01:25:31,799 --> 01:25:33,634
Follow us.

1132
01:25:33,717 --> 01:25:37,179
Weapons are not allowed in here.
So you place them here.

1133
01:25:37,262 --> 01:25:39,264
Leave your weapons, boys.
Soldiers.

1134
01:25:46,021 --> 01:25:48,982
You wait here.
Here. Have a seat.

1135
01:25:49,066 --> 01:25:50,275
And you will bring us water?

1136
01:25:51,068 --> 01:25:52,402
Certainly.

1137
01:26:07,417 --> 01:26:09,502
Goodblood will see you now.

1138
01:26:10,253 --> 01:26:11,254
Him.

1139
01:26:36,113 --> 01:26:38,156
Have a seat here.

1140
01:26:52,838 --> 01:26:55,173
Goodblood says
this is a token of appreciation...

1141
01:26:55,257 --> 01:26:57,592
Yo! What are you doing?

1142
01:26:58,886 --> 01:27:04,099
I'm sorry. The Supreme Commander
is so very upset to keep you waiting.

1143
01:27:04,182 --> 01:27:06,309
Please, will you follow me?

1144
01:27:10,272 --> 01:27:11,648
Please sit.

1145
01:27:16,361 --> 01:27:17,737
What is this?

1146
01:27:17,738 --> 01:27:18,947
- What is this?
- He'll be with you shortly.

1147
01:27:19,031 --> 01:27:21,116
Huh? Where is the water?

1148
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:23,243
Bring them water, quickly!

1149
01:28:03,616 --> 01:28:04,993
Commandant.

1150
01:28:07,704 --> 01:28:08,746
Commandant?

1151
01:28:10,665 --> 01:28:11,959
Commandant.

1152
01:28:14,502 --> 01:28:15,963
<i>I trust you rested well.</i>

1153
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:19,925
I would like you to know
we also offered rations and water

1154
01:28:20,008 --> 01:28:22,970
to the rest of your battalion
this morning.

1155
01:28:23,053 --> 01:28:24,721
Thank you, Deputy.

1156
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:35,148
Please, gentlemen.
Please come over.

1157
01:28:38,235 --> 01:28:39,652
Stand there.

1158
01:28:49,704 --> 01:28:50,705
Attention!

1159
01:29:07,555 --> 01:29:09,557
Commandant.

1160
01:29:09,641 --> 01:29:11,559
Supreme Commander, sir.

1161
01:29:14,562 --> 01:29:15,856
At ease, gentlemen.

1162
01:29:15,939 --> 01:29:17,774
At ease.

1163
01:29:27,575 --> 01:29:29,995
It looks like your family has grown.

1164
01:29:30,078 --> 01:29:33,916
They must eat while we talk,
unless you are hungry, too.

1165
01:29:33,999 --> 01:29:37,585
I'm not hungry. Two-I-C,
take them and go and eat.

1166
01:29:37,669 --> 01:29:40,380
Two-I-C, you stay.

1167
01:29:40,463 --> 01:29:41,589
Come.

1168
01:29:46,303 --> 01:29:49,597
Lot of food over here.
Let's eat, man!

1169
01:29:50,598 --> 01:29:52,184
I love food.

1170
01:29:59,316 --> 01:30:00,775
What is this?

1171
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,363
You have made me wait.

1172
01:30:06,614 --> 01:30:10,452
You are leading me to believe
we are changing objectives.

1173
01:30:10,535 --> 01:30:13,413
Are we not taking the capital anymore?

1174
01:30:13,496 --> 01:30:17,625
Chief, to protect our people,
the time is now.

1175
01:30:17,709 --> 01:30:22,880
If we have the momentum
and we have the power, why wait?

1176
01:30:22,965 --> 01:30:28,345
You are not the political voice
of this movement, Commandant. I am.

1177
01:30:28,428 --> 01:30:32,765
Protecting our people
remains the priority.

1178
01:30:32,849 --> 01:30:36,894
But as you know, the world is
becoming aware of this war now.

1179
01:30:37,812 --> 01:30:40,815
No one will escape judgment
when it is over.

1180
01:30:42,150 --> 01:30:45,778
And the decisions we make
have far deeper consequences.

1181
01:30:45,862 --> 01:30:50,492
And what decisions have you made...
for my battalion?

1182
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:55,622
Are you not making me general?

1183
01:30:55,705 --> 01:30:57,749
No, I am not.

1184
01:30:57,832 --> 01:31:01,294
I'm giving your battalion
to Two-I-C, Commandant.

1185
01:31:01,378 --> 01:31:02,712
That is why I brought you here.

1186
01:31:02,795 --> 01:31:07,717
And you, I will promote
to Deputy Chief of Security,

1187
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:08,801
effective immediately.

1188
01:31:08,885 --> 01:31:12,639
I hope you accept and act accordingly.

1189
01:31:14,182 --> 01:31:16,476
Thank you, sir. I promise
to fulfill my duty to the fullest...

1190
01:31:16,559 --> 01:31:18,079
Two-I-C, shut your mouth!

1191
01:31:19,479 --> 01:31:21,023
Get out!

1192
01:31:24,484 --> 01:31:25,652
Soldiers.

1193
01:31:33,701 --> 01:31:36,454
You are demoting me.

1194
01:31:37,705 --> 01:31:42,335
This, my battalion...
that I have made with my own hands.

1195
01:31:42,419 --> 01:31:44,003
I'm their father!

1196
01:31:44,087 --> 01:31:47,340
Your battalion is my battalion,
Commandant,

1197
01:31:47,424 --> 01:31:49,967
as are hundreds of others
across this nation.

1198
01:31:50,885 --> 01:31:53,305
I want the ceremony of changeover
tomorrow,

1199
01:31:53,388 --> 01:31:56,349
so that Two-I-C can take the battalion
back out for battle.

1200
01:31:56,433 --> 01:32:00,520
As you know, and with thanks to you,
we have the NRC on their heels

1201
01:32:00,603 --> 01:32:03,731
with the help and support
of the UN and ECOMOD.

1202
01:32:03,815 --> 01:32:07,026
It has now become
a battle for public image.

1203
01:32:08,736 --> 01:32:11,156
And what of my payment? Hmm?

1204
01:32:11,239 --> 01:32:12,574
What of my payment?

1205
01:32:12,657 --> 01:32:17,495
What share of the resources
will I be seeing?

1206
01:32:18,037 --> 01:32:20,957
Do not forget you are a soldier.

1207
01:32:21,541 --> 01:32:24,086
Your most important duty is obedience.

1208
01:32:24,169 --> 01:32:25,628
Your first duty is obedience.

1209
01:32:25,712 --> 01:32:27,505
Your second duty is obedience.

1210
01:32:27,589 --> 01:32:30,300
Your third duty is obedience.
Everything is obedience.

1211
01:32:30,383 --> 01:32:34,512
Without obedience, you have nothing.

1212
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:39,101
Have you forgotten yourself?

1213
01:32:41,644 --> 01:32:43,896
I have not forgotten myself.

1214
01:32:45,773 --> 01:32:47,984
You are right.

1215
01:32:48,067 --> 01:32:51,488
I'm a soldier...

1216
01:32:51,571 --> 01:32:54,116
not a politician.

1217
01:32:56,493 --> 01:33:01,206
I will have one more night...
with my men.

1218
01:33:05,293 --> 01:33:06,961
Dada Goodblood.

1219
01:33:09,881 --> 01:33:10,881
Move out!

1220
01:33:10,882 --> 01:33:11,799
- Move out!
- Move!

1221
01:33:11,883 --> 01:33:12,717
Move out!

1222
01:33:12,718 --> 01:33:13,926
- Move out!
- Move out!

1223
01:33:14,010 --> 01:33:15,595
Let's go.

1224
01:33:22,310 --> 01:33:23,644
Tripod.

1225
01:33:23,645 --> 01:33:24,562
- Tripod.
- Yes, sir.

1226
01:33:24,646 --> 01:33:28,024
Assemble the COs and the troops
and bivouac outside of town.

1227
01:33:28,107 --> 01:33:31,319
I'm taking Two-I-C and the boys
to all celebrate tonight.

1228
01:33:31,403 --> 01:33:32,529
Yes, sir.

1229
01:33:32,612 --> 01:33:34,322
Where are we going?

1230
01:33:36,366 --> 01:33:38,410
You will see.

1231
01:33:38,493 --> 01:33:40,328
You will like it.

1232
01:33:40,412 --> 01:33:44,374
And if you and Strika are my bodyguards,
and I am going, then you are also going.

1233
01:33:44,457 --> 01:33:46,334
Are you hearing me?

1234
01:34:08,273 --> 01:34:10,900
<i>Imagination TV.</i>

1235
01:34:10,983 --> 01:34:12,694
Ha! So you come!

1236
01:34:12,777 --> 01:34:17,573
Ha! Commandant! Commandant!

1237
01:34:17,574 --> 01:34:18,533
- Ha! Commandant! Commandant!
- Ah, Mama.

1238
01:34:18,616 --> 01:34:20,618
Welcome, welcome.

1239
01:34:20,702 --> 01:34:23,062
Yeah, make 'em bring
something for my soldiers.

1240
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:24,622
- Okay.
- And my own soldier.

1241
01:34:24,706 --> 01:34:25,707
Hey, hey...

1242
01:34:25,790 --> 01:34:29,211
Bring beer. Bring soda.
Bring whatever you have.

1243
01:34:29,294 --> 01:34:31,338
Hey, hey! Get up!

1244
01:34:31,421 --> 01:34:33,673
Hurry, hurry!

1245
01:34:33,756 --> 01:34:37,469
Can't you see we have guests? Hurry!

1246
01:34:42,181 --> 01:34:43,933
The beer is warm.

1247
01:34:44,934 --> 01:34:46,436
How is the beer warm?

1248
01:34:46,519 --> 01:34:47,978
No ice.

1249
01:34:47,979 --> 01:34:48,980
- No ice.
- No ice?

1250
01:34:49,063 --> 01:34:51,524
No light.

1251
01:34:51,608 --> 01:34:53,360
But I am seeing light.

1252
01:34:53,443 --> 01:34:54,902
No ice.

1253
01:34:54,986 --> 01:34:58,240
Oh! Well, doesn't matter

1254
01:34:58,323 --> 01:35:00,783
because we will drink it
whether it's hot or it's cold.

1255
01:35:00,867 --> 01:35:03,077
Go on. Share it.

1256
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:05,204
Commandant, permission to be dismissed.

1257
01:35:05,288 --> 01:35:06,956
I need to be checking on the others...

1258
01:35:07,039 --> 01:35:08,708
Negative!

1259
01:35:10,877 --> 01:35:14,171
You will be staying here
so we can celebrate you.

1260
01:35:14,256 --> 01:35:19,010
In fact, Mama, I want you to bring
a special one for my Two-I-C,

1261
01:35:19,093 --> 01:35:22,264
who will soon be the Commandant.

1262
01:35:22,347 --> 01:35:23,680
Who is your Commandant?

1263
01:35:23,681 --> 01:35:24,516
- Who is your Commandant?
- You, sir!

1264
01:35:24,599 --> 01:35:27,560
Hmm.
But you have one special for Two-I-C.

1265
01:35:27,644 --> 01:35:29,812
No problem.

1266
01:35:29,896 --> 01:35:32,524
No problem.

1267
01:35:34,901 --> 01:35:36,611
No problem.

1268
01:35:36,694 --> 01:35:39,572
Hey, Mama, this one has fresh papaya.

1269
01:35:39,656 --> 01:35:41,198
No, no, no, no, Commandant.

1270
01:35:41,283 --> 01:35:42,825
Leave this one now.

1271
01:35:42,909 --> 01:35:46,746
If it is women you wanting,
I get plenty from backyard.

1272
01:35:46,829 --> 01:35:49,999
Just bring me my own.
You know my specifications.

1273
01:35:50,082 --> 01:35:51,250
I know! I know!

1274
01:35:51,334 --> 01:35:53,252
Aunty, bring us some chips.

1275
01:35:53,336 --> 01:35:54,712
Ah.

1276
01:35:54,796 --> 01:35:57,340
See this little yeah-yeah boy
born yesterday.

1277
01:35:57,424 --> 01:36:00,468
Don't mind him. Don't mind him.

1278
01:36:00,552 --> 01:36:01,802
Where are the girls?

1279
01:36:01,803 --> 01:36:03,723
- Where are the girls?
- They are coming.

1280
01:36:04,722 --> 01:36:09,894
We've got enough girls for the men,
but no more for the little boys.

1281
01:36:12,397 --> 01:36:14,816
Leave your weapons with Strika.

1282
01:36:21,656 --> 01:36:23,408
Oh-ho!

1283
01:36:24,867 --> 01:36:27,244
You're the controller.

1284
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:30,707
How are you? How are you?

1285
01:36:30,790 --> 01:36:33,000
Look at you.
Look at you.

1286
01:36:33,084 --> 01:36:35,252
Commandant. Commandant.

1287
01:36:35,337 --> 01:36:38,213
You are looking very hot.

1288
01:36:38,214 --> 01:36:39,341
- You are looking very hot.
- Yeah, I miss you.

1289
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:40,383
Oh, you miss me. Really?

1290
01:36:40,383 --> 01:36:41,258
- Oh, you miss me. Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

1291
01:36:41,343 --> 01:36:43,511
Strika.

1292
01:36:43,595 --> 01:36:45,805
SBU, be watching guard.

1293
01:36:45,888 --> 01:36:50,393
Don't be watching your Commandant
because you can't have what I'm having.

1294
01:37:08,536 --> 01:37:09,856
<i>We'll start shooting.</i>

1295
01:37:10,246 --> 01:37:12,289
<i>Go stand by the waterfall.</i>

1296
01:38:09,305 --> 01:38:11,433
What happened? Huh?

1297
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:14,101
What happened?

1298
01:38:16,228 --> 01:38:17,229
You did this.

1299
01:38:17,313 --> 01:38:19,732
What happened to my man?
What happened here?

1300
01:38:19,816 --> 01:38:21,818
I was just playing with his gun
and it just went off.

1301
01:38:21,901 --> 01:38:23,444
I don't know what happened. I'm sorry.

1302
01:38:23,445 --> 01:38:24,904
- I don't know what happened. I'm sorry.
- You did this.

1303
01:38:24,987 --> 01:38:27,740
- You did this.
- Relax, relax, relax, relax!

1304
01:38:27,824 --> 01:38:29,366
You did this! You did this!

1305
01:38:29,451 --> 01:38:31,327
I didn't mean to.

1306
01:38:31,410 --> 01:38:32,620
- You thought you were shooting me!
- No, no, no!

1307
01:38:32,704 --> 01:38:33,870
You thought it was me?

1308
01:38:33,871 --> 01:38:34,872
- You thought it was me?
- I didn't mean to. I'm so sorry.

1309
01:38:34,956 --> 01:38:36,541
Were you trying to kill me
and you kill my soldier?

1310
01:38:36,624 --> 01:38:39,586
It was an accident!
No! Not me...

1311
01:38:39,669 --> 01:38:40,795
Go!

1312
01:38:43,339 --> 01:38:45,382
- Let's go. Let's go! Hey!
- Move!

1313
01:38:45,467 --> 01:38:47,844
Pick him up! Pick him up!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

1314
01:38:47,927 --> 01:38:49,807
Pick him up!
I want you to take all their women!

1315
01:38:49,846 --> 01:38:51,138
- Move! Move! Move! Move!
- All of them!

1316
01:38:51,222 --> 01:38:52,056
Move!

1317
01:38:52,057 --> 01:38:54,217

Agu, is that you?

- <i>Iron Jacket, where are you?</i>

<i>Iron Jacket, you are disobeying a direct...</i>

1343
01:40:41,123 --> 01:40:44,627
Agu, these are very dangerous times.

1344
01:40:45,544 --> 01:40:48,130
Never know who you could be trusting.

1345
01:40:48,214 --> 01:40:49,298
Huh?

1346
01:40:50,341 --> 01:40:54,721
That is why it is good
to always sleep one eye open.

1347
01:40:55,805 --> 01:40:58,600
That is why I have you and I have Strika.

1348
01:41:03,479 --> 01:41:06,273
Agu, sometimes I'm feeling sorry for you.

1349
01:41:08,693 --> 01:41:10,236
Sometimes I am.

1350

Amen.

Two-I-C.

1359
01:41:45,813 --> 01:41:46,648
Yes, sir!

1360
01:41:46,649 --> 01:41:48,232
Yes, sir!

1361
01:41:50,067 --> 01:41:53,112
This was not God's work.

1362
01:41:53,195 --> 01:41:54,822
This was man.

1363
01:41:55,406 --> 01:41:58,034
Supreme Commandant was our friend.

1364
01:41:58,534 --> 01:42:00,995
Now he's our enemy.

1365
01:42:01,078 --> 01:42:05,917
But we are not fearing change,
for we are strong!

1366
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,670
Strong and proud!

1367
01:42:09,211 --> 01:42:13,966
That is why we should be
taking our own territory...

1368
01:42:15,551 --> 01:42:18,137
and filling our own pockets.

1369
01:42:19,972 --> 01:42:23,726
Gentlemen, move out.

1370
01:42:24,435 --> 01:42:26,145
Let's move.

1371
01:42:30,983 --> 01:42:35,947

<i>We are leaving him.</i>

1373
01:42:39,075 --> 01:42:41,493
<i>And I am thinking,</i>

1374
01:42:41,577 --> 01:42:44,706
<i>"The only way not to be
fighting anymore is to be dying."</i>

1375
01:43:38,885 --> 01:43:41,137
Medic!
Where's the fucking medic?

1376
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:43,264
He's fucking dead, my man!

1377
01:43:49,311 --> 01:43:53,274
<i>People are dying
just like this every day.</i>

1378
01:43:53,357 --> 01:43:56,735
<i>Every person I am knowing is dying.</i>

1379
01:43:56,819 --> 01:43:58,654
<i>And I am thinking,</i>

1380
01:43:58,737 --> 01:44:04,660
<i>"If this war is ever ending, I cannot be
going back to doing child things."</i>

1381
01:44:13,502 --> 01:44:16,588
<i>Bullet is just eating everything.</i>

1382
01:44:18,841 --> 01:44:22,887
<i>Leaves, trees, ground, person.</i>

1383
01:44:24,596 --> 01:44:25,597
<i>Eating them.</i>

1384
01:44:26,432 --> 01:44:29,393
<i>Just making person to bleed everywhere.</i>

1385
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:40,196
<i>We are just like wild animals now
with no place to be going.</i>

1386
01:44:45,742 --> 01:44:47,995
<i>Sun,</i>

1387
01:44:48,079 --> 01:44:50,414

01:44:52,166 --> 01:44:55,627
<i>I am wanting to catch you in my hands,</i>

1389
01:44:55,711 --> 01:45:00,091
<i>to squeeze you until
you cannot shine no more.</i>

1390
01:45:02,176 --> 01:45:05,137
<i>That way, everything is always dark</i>

1391
01:45:05,221 --> 01:45:07,389
<i>and nobody's ever having to see</i>

1392

<i>all the terrible things
that are happening here.</i>

1393
01:45:54,478 --> 01:45:56,438
Preacher!

1394
01:46:00,401 --> 01:46:01,485
Sir.

1395
01:46:09,868 --> 01:46:11,370
Thank you, sir.

1396
01:46:34,685 --> 01:46:36,520
Strika.

1397
01:46:37,104 --> 01:46:39,190
Strika! Strika! Strika!

1398
01:46:39,898 --> 01:46:42,568
Stand up and let's go!
We are going.

1399
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:46,030
Let's go!

1400
01:46:47,531 --> 01:46:49,033
Strika!

1401
01:46:50,409 --> 01:46:52,119
Stand up and let's go!

1402
01:46:54,788 --> 01:46:56,707
What is wrong with you?

1403
01:47:00,711 --> 01:47:02,213
What is wrong?

1404
01:48:03,482 --> 01:48:08,320
<i>I am wanting to say to Strika,
"I am tired, too."</i>

<i>and so the words are not

Strika?

1408
01:48:51,155 --> 01:48:52,781
Do you hear that?

1409
01:48:54,366 --> 01:48:56,702
A song, just like my mother sang.

1410
01:49:00,081 --> 01:49:01,290
Strika?

1411
01:49:03,250 --> 01:49:04,460
Strika?

1412
01:49:06,753 --> 01:49:07,963
Strika.

1413
01:49:16,638 --> 01:49:19,100
Strika! Strika!

1414
01:49:20,892 --> 01:49:22,103
Strika!

1415

Strika!

1416
01:49:37,075 --> 01:49:38,660
Someone help us.

1417
01:49:42,748 --> 01:49:44,208
Strika!

1418
01:49:45,292 --> 01:49:46,502
Strika!

01:49:49,713 --> 01:49:51,132
Strika!

Strika!

1421
01:51:02,578 --> 01:51:06,207
Fuck you. Life is sad.

1422
01:51:24,808 --> 01:51:28,312
Agu. Agu. Agu!

1423
01:51:28,395 --> 01:51:29,521
Sir?

1424
01:51:29,605 --> 01:51:32,524
Go get me some fucking bullets

1425
01:51:33,900 --> 01:51:35,026
Move!

1426
01:51:59,426 --> 01:52:01,136
Do you have bullet?

1427
01:52:15,401 --> 01:52:16,610
<i>Mother.</i>

<i>Your song is making my body to move,</i>

<i>Not about Strika, not about this war,</i>

1432
01:52:47,516 --> 01:52:51,353
<i>not about any of the things

1433
01:52:56,483 --> 01:53:00,362

Commandant, sir.

1436
01:54:07,345 --> 01:54:09,264
We are out from bullet.

1437
01:54:14,478 --> 01:54:17,814
It wasn't supposed to be the way
that it has turned out to be.

1438
01:54:19,065 --> 01:54:22,193
Everybody betrays you eventually.

1439
01:54:24,070 --> 01:54:27,866
But you, I will always protect you, Agu,
because you are my son...

1440
01:54:29,868 --> 01:54:32,704
and a son always protects a father.

1441
01:54:37,208 --> 01:54:40,504
Commandant, I want to talk to you, sir.

1442
01:54:40,587 --> 01:54:42,506
What is all this?

1443
01:54:42,589 --> 01:54:43,965
We are leaving, sir.

1444
01:54:44,049 --> 01:54:45,592
Who is leaving?

1445
01:54:47,302 --> 01:54:50,263
Who and who is leaving?

1446
01:54:51,973 --> 01:54:54,726
Two-I-C, go back to your post.

1447
01:54:55,936 --> 01:54:59,648
No, sir. We are going, sir.

1448
01:54:59,731 --> 01:55:01,900
You are the only one
standing in front of me, stupid.

1449
01:55:02,734 --> 01:55:08,323
I am going, sir. No bullets.
What am I going to use to shoot my enemy?

1450
01:55:08,990 --> 01:55:10,826
We have been here for months now.

1451
01:55:10,909 --> 01:55:13,078
Gold miners, no gold.

1452
01:55:13,161 --> 01:55:16,748
No money, no food, no water.

1453
01:55:16,832 --> 01:55:18,459
It madness, Commandant.

1454
01:55:19,209 --> 01:55:21,545
People sick here and dying every day.

1455
01:55:22,963 --> 01:55:25,757
It madness, Commander.

1456
01:55:25,841 --> 01:55:27,551
Who want to stay here and die?

1457
01:55:27,634 --> 01:55:28,718
I want to go!

1458
01:55:28,719 --> 01:55:30,136
- I want to go!
- I want to going!

1459
01:55:30,220 --> 01:55:32,055
Who want to stay here and die?

1460
01:55:32,138 --> 01:55:33,557
I want to go, sir!

1461
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:35,266
Me, too. I want to go, sir!

1462
01:55:36,059 --> 01:55:37,894
Who want to stay here and die?

1463
01:55:37,978 --> 01:55:39,019
Nobody want to stay here, sir!

1464
01:55:39,020 --> 01:55:41,140
- Nobody want to stay here, sir!
- We want to go, sir.

1465
01:55:41,482 --> 01:55:43,024
Then come and tell him how you feel.

1466
01:55:44,526 --> 01:55:48,739
Come and tell him
how much we are suffering here.

1467
01:55:50,365 --> 01:55:53,785
Come! Everybody, come.

1468
01:55:53,869 --> 01:55:56,580
So, you...
you are the big man now, huh?

1469
01:55:57,748 --> 01:55:58,957
Hmm?

1470
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:01,209
Where will you be going? Huh?

1471
01:56:01,292 --> 01:56:04,295
Will you surrender to the other NDF camp?

1472
01:56:04,379 --> 01:56:07,048
No. They will eat you.

1473
01:56:08,592 --> 01:56:11,386
And what of ECOMOD? Huh?

1474
01:56:11,470 --> 01:56:14,180
That might be better, but what next?

1475
01:56:14,264 --> 01:56:16,182
Jail?

1476
01:56:16,266 --> 01:56:18,184
War crimes?

1477
01:56:18,268 --> 01:56:19,352
Huh?

1478
01:56:21,187 --> 01:56:26,485
You think you can just go
and do what you want in peace?

1479
01:56:26,568 --> 01:56:29,112
You will go back to your village

1480
01:56:29,195 --> 01:56:33,492
and your family will not
associate themselves with you.

1481
01:56:33,575 --> 01:56:35,410
Huh? You will be nothing.

1482
01:56:35,494 --> 01:56:39,748
You and your uneducated, poor mind,
you'll be nothing.

1483
01:56:39,831 --> 01:56:43,334
Nobody will care for you. Huh?

1484
01:56:43,418 --> 01:56:45,754
Look at you.

1485
01:56:45,837 --> 01:56:52,343
And you will wake up and you will rise
and see the sunrise and see the sunset,

1486
01:56:52,427 --> 01:56:55,889
and you can just wait all day, all day,

1487
01:56:55,972 --> 01:57:00,602
with thousands of men just like you,
waiting for somebody to give you a job.

1488
01:57:00,686 --> 01:57:01,728
Huh?

1489
01:57:02,729 --> 01:57:05,023
That is what you want to go and do?

1490
01:57:05,106 --> 01:57:08,151
You are stupid!

1491
01:57:08,652 --> 01:57:11,655
You have nothing!
No future!

1492
01:57:11,738 --> 01:57:12,906
I am your future.

1493
01:57:13,448 --> 01:57:15,576
You fucking die here, sir.

1494
01:57:15,659 --> 01:57:16,993
What?

1495
01:57:22,207 --> 01:57:25,376
How are you going to shoot me
if you don't have bullets?

1496
01:57:27,754 --> 01:57:30,423
And you, Agu?

1497
01:57:30,506 --> 01:57:32,425
You wanna kill Commandant?

1498
01:57:33,134 --> 01:57:36,221
Hey, Agu, I want you
to kill Commandant. Come.

1499
01:57:36,304 --> 01:57:37,138
Push it.

1500
01:57:37,138 --> 01:57:38,014
- Push it.
- Do it.

1501
01:57:38,098 --> 01:57:40,934
Come, Agu, come.
Put it here. Here!

1502
01:57:41,017 --> 01:57:42,227
A-ha! A-ha!

1503
01:57:43,144 --> 01:57:44,437
Wanna kill Commandant?

1504
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:46,439
Do it, Agu.

1505
01:57:46,982 --> 01:57:48,441
Do it.

1506
01:57:48,524 --> 01:57:51,111
Kill Commandant!

1507
01:57:51,194 --> 01:57:52,988
You wanna surrender?

1508
01:57:53,071 --> 01:57:54,239
Huh?

1509
01:57:54,322 --> 01:57:56,282
You wanna surrender?

1510
01:57:59,535 --> 01:58:01,121
You wanna surrender?

1511
01:58:03,081 --> 01:58:04,165
Yes.

1512
01:58:10,964 --> 01:58:12,257
Hey, Agu.

1513
01:58:15,510 --> 01:58:16,970
Just get out.

1514
01:58:19,765 --> 01:58:24,645
Just remember,
when you are all poor and hungry

1515
01:58:26,229 --> 01:58:28,189
you'll remember me!

1516
01:58:29,149 --> 01:58:32,068
You'll remember your Commandant.

1517
01:58:32,568 --> 01:58:34,988
Just go! Just go!

1518
01:58:35,071 --> 01:58:36,865
Come on. Everybody, let's move!

1519
01:58:36,948 --> 01:58:38,700
- Yes, sir!
- Come on, let's go.

1520
01:58:38,784 --> 01:58:43,038
And know that I will be
calling for you one day.

1521
01:58:45,290 --> 01:58:48,960
Go and drink gunpowder tea
and playing draughts.

1522
01:58:49,044 --> 01:58:53,131
No, no, no. You remember me.
You remember your Commandant.

1523
01:58:53,214 --> 01:58:55,216
You're gonna say, "Yeah!"

1524
01:58:58,845 --> 01:59:01,890
Remember, I will call for you again...

1525
01:59:01,973 --> 01:59:04,893
and you'll come.

1526
01:59:06,978 --> 01:59:08,271
Remember.

1527
01:59:18,198 --> 01:59:22,577
They will just lock you up in jail!
You are stupid!

1528
01:59:23,494 --> 01:59:25,914
When the time come back,

1529
01:59:25,997 --> 01:59:28,333
the other ones,
they'll come eat you.

1530
01:59:28,416 --> 01:59:31,795
Just chop for you...
your heart.

1531
01:59:31,878 --> 01:59:34,547
Agu, you stay here because they don't...

1532
02:00:17,758 --> 02:00:19,342
Halt! Stop there!

1533
02:00:19,425 --> 02:00:20,634
Who are you?

1534
02:00:20,635 --> 02:00:21,636
- Who are you?
- NDF, sir!

1535
02:00:21,720 --> 02:00:22,721
And what is your mission here?

1536
02:00:22,804 --> 02:00:23,844
Surrender, sir!

1537
02:00:23,889 --> 02:00:26,808
Raise up your arms!
All weapons in the air!

1538
02:00:26,892 --> 02:00:27,893
All of you!

1539
02:00:29,144 --> 02:00:31,521
Now turn and face the bush!

1540
02:00:31,604 --> 02:00:35,025
Don't look at my face!
Put your weapons on the ground!

1541
02:00:35,108 --> 02:00:38,361
Step back.
Step back!

1542
02:00:38,444 --> 02:00:40,488
And turn around!

1543
02:00:40,571 --> 02:00:42,240
I said, turn around!

1544
02:00:42,323 --> 02:00:43,658
All right, hands up!

1545
02:00:43,742 --> 02:00:46,244
Hands up! Sit on the floor!

1546
02:00:51,416 --> 02:00:53,251
Sit down!

1547
02:00:54,252 --> 02:00:56,379
Put your hands on your head!

1548
02:01:01,176 --> 02:01:03,011
Don't look at my face!

1549
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:52,097
Agu, how are you settling in?

1550
02:03:53,014 --> 02:03:54,140
Hmm?

1551
02:03:56,267 --> 02:03:59,104
I know things are hard.

1552
02:03:59,729 --> 02:04:01,772
I've been there, remember?

1553
02:04:03,441 --> 02:04:06,152
We are all here to help you.

1554
02:04:07,070 --> 02:04:08,947
Okay?

1555
02:04:09,030 --> 02:04:12,075
<i>I am not knowing
how long I am staying here...</i>

1556
02:04:13,284 --> 02:04:16,537
<i>but I'm staying here for a long time.</i>

1557
02:04:18,331 --> 02:04:23,669
<i>Some week, some month, I am not knowing.</i>

1558
02:04:25,921 --> 02:04:29,217
<i>All I am knowing
is how it is feeling here.</i>

1559
02:04:31,761 --> 02:04:37,017
<i>I am knowing the sound of people screaming
and the smell of dead bodies...</i>

1560
02:04:38,476 --> 02:04:43,731
<i>and I am knowing the feeling of
the brown-brown and</i> djamba <i>in my blood.</i>

1561
02:04:52,073 --> 02:04:53,866
Hey, calm down!

1562
02:04:53,949 --> 02:04:55,243
This is your home!

1563
02:04:55,326 --> 02:04:57,745
No, they are giving us poison there!

1564
02:04:57,828 --> 02:04:59,497
- They want us to die!
- Yes!

1565
02:04:59,580 --> 02:05:01,082
- They want us to die!
- Calm!

1566
02:05:01,166 --> 02:05:03,793
<i>Preacher is tiring of this place.</i>

1567
02:05:03,876 --> 02:05:05,920
<i>He's saying, "The war is not over,</i>

1568
02:05:06,004 --> 02:05:08,714
<i>"and they are needing fighters like us."</i>

1569
02:05:08,798 --> 02:05:11,926
We need money for here.
We need money. Eh?

1570
02:05:12,010 --> 02:05:14,054
You can't stay here without money.

1571
02:05:14,845 --> 02:05:17,265
And we're soldiers,

1572
02:05:17,348 --> 02:05:19,642
fighting is what we know.

1573
02:05:19,725 --> 02:05:21,769
That's what we should do.

1574
02:05:21,852 --> 02:05:24,564
Have you forgotten?
We have food to eat.

1575
02:05:24,647 --> 02:05:26,274
- We have shelter.
- Shh!

1576
02:05:29,402 --> 02:05:32,279
And even we learn, we learn.

1577
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:33,156
- And even we learn, we learn.
- Yeah.

1578
02:05:33,239 --> 02:05:34,532
You for shut up!

1579
02:05:34,615 --> 02:05:37,785
You NRC soldier,
with the talk, you talk too much.

1580
02:05:39,370 --> 02:05:42,332
Agu, I can't stay here. I'm leaving.

1581
02:05:42,415 --> 02:05:44,166
Preacher!

1582
02:05:44,167 --> 02:05:45,167
- Preacher!
- Let's go!

1583
02:05:45,960 --> 02:05:49,089
Randy, don't go into the bush again.

1584
02:05:51,299 --> 02:05:52,758
Don't follow Preacher.

1585
02:05:52,842 --> 02:05:55,178
Randy!

1586
02:06:08,983 --> 02:06:11,902
I don't like when you look into my eyes.

1587
02:06:11,986 --> 02:06:15,906
So if I look at a table,
how can I talk to you?

1588
02:06:15,990 --> 02:06:17,492
<i>Amy.</i>

1589
02:06:17,575 --> 02:06:19,619
<i>She thinks that my no speaking</i>

1590
02:06:19,702 --> 02:06:23,414
<i>is because I can't be
explaining myself like baby,</i>

1591
02:06:23,498 --> 02:06:25,500
<i>but I am not like baby.</i>

1592
02:06:25,583 --> 02:06:29,712
<i>I am like old man
and she's like small girl</i>

1593
02:06:29,795 --> 02:06:34,967
<i>because I am fighting in war
and she's not even knowing what war is.</i>

1594
02:06:35,510 --> 02:06:37,220
Try.

1595
02:06:37,303 --> 02:06:41,307
Try to talk to me about
some of your experiences...

1596
02:06:42,517 --> 02:06:46,437
or try to tell me what you are thinking.

1597
02:06:49,232 --> 02:06:51,442
I'm thinking about my future.

1598
02:06:52,777 --> 02:06:53,861
Very good.

1599
02:06:53,944 --> 02:06:56,114
Very good.

1600
02:06:56,197 --> 02:06:59,159
So how do you see your future?

1601
02:07:07,583 --> 02:07:09,502
Do me this favor, okay?

1602
02:07:14,757 --> 02:07:19,637
I think if you talk to me about it,
it will make you feel better.

1603
02:07:28,354 --> 02:07:30,356
I saw terrible things...

1604
02:07:32,858 --> 02:07:35,695
and I did terrible things.

1605
02:07:35,778 --> 02:07:38,781
So if I'm talking to you,

1606
02:07:38,864 --> 02:07:44,204
it will make me sad...
and it will make you, too, sad.

1607
02:07:44,287 --> 02:07:45,871
In this life...

1608
02:07:47,748 --> 02:07:50,876
I just want to be happy in this life.

1609
02:07:53,588 --> 02:07:56,090
If I'm telling this to you...

1610
02:07:59,969 --> 02:08:02,305
you will think that...

1611
02:08:07,518 --> 02:08:10,020
I am some sort of beast...

1612
02:08:12,398 --> 02:08:14,317
or devil.

1613
02:08:18,321 --> 02:08:20,656
I am all of these things...

1614
02:08:23,117 --> 02:08:25,536
but I also having mother...

1615
02:08:29,540 --> 02:08:30,916
father...
