1
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:33,279
You left your job two months ago?

2
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,824
I was employed for 8 years.
Just quit recently.

3
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:40,286
You were there for quite awhile.
Why'd you quit?

4
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,204
To be honest,

5
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:46,000
the company was restructuring,
so I voluntarily resigned.

6
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:51,422
You worked with them for 8 years...
in the same position?

7
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,049
Yes.

8
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,342
And your age...?

9
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:56,427
32.

10
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,806
You left your job recently?

11
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,269
Actually, I resigned voluntarily...

12
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:07,521
I see...
That'll be all.

13
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,830
Sujin.

14
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:26,791
A word?

15
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:27,625
Yes.

16
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:32,171
I'm thinking about selling the café.

17
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,422
Really?

18
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:37,510
Any chance you might be interested?

19
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:41,889
It would be better to hand it over to
you than some stranger...

20
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:45,768
You've been wanting to
get a shop of your own, no?

21
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,815
Well... I'd have to ask my fiancé...

22
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:55,611
Sure, talk it over and let me know?

23
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,154
Okay.

24
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:08,582
You're back?

25
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,209
Did you eat?

26
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,132
Do you have any money?

27
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:20,052
I gave you a hundred last week.

28
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,471
You used that up already?

29
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,432
What good is a hundred bucks?!

30
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:28,477
Yeonwoo!
You can't waste money like that!

31
00:04:28,728 --> 00:04:30,187
Fine, then don't give me any.

32
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:35,401
What about dinner?

33
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,006
You got here early!
Did you get off work early?

34
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,215
Huh? Yeah...

35
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:01,010
- Cold, huh?
- Not really.

36
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:06,265
Hey!

37
00:05:07,183 --> 00:05:08,809
You're going out again?

38
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:10,770
How've you been?

39
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,230
Where are your manners?!

40
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:17,193
Sorry...

41
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,946
So, what did you want to talk about?

42
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:28,120
A shop?

43
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:30,164
Yeah!
I've been saving...

44
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,625
And if you take out a loan,
it should be enough...

45
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:33,793
It's a great deal...

46
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,337
Still... not now.

47
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,714
Think about it, please?

48
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:40,758
No, I'm against it...

49
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:44,970
Sujin...
Let's do this later.

50
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,890
We need to prepare for
our wedding first...

51
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,391
Later...

52
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:51,894
But, Minsoo...

53
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,147
No... I said, no!

54
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:04,573
Okay...

55
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:09,745
Fine.

56
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,133
Isn't it time for
personnel changes, soon?

57
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:25,970
Yeah.

58
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,347
You better get promoted this time!

59
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,100
Don't worry about it...

60
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:55,035
Sorry.
My fiancé is just so against it...

61
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,621
No need to apologize...

62
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,623
It is unfortunate, though...

63
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:02,876
I was going to give you
a good bargain...

64
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:07,172
Yeah. Thanks for the offer...

65
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,221
Welcome.

66
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,727
You were laid off two months ago?

67
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:21,687
Yes. It wasn't what I...

68
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:25,733
You were employed for 8 years...
But, no promotions?

69
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:00,642
I understand your situation...

70
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,227
But, I'm sorry.

71
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:07,149
It's been tough lately.
Noone's hiring right now.

72
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,442
Yeah, I know.

73
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,737
But that's why
I'm asking for your help.

74
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:14,698
It's not that easy...

75
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,454
Please...

76
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:30,881
Actually, the Development Team
might have an open spot...

77
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:34,676
I'll see what I can do.
But, don't get your hopes up.

78
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:37,054
Thank you. Thank you.

79
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,305
No need to thank me.

80
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:41,350
When can I hear back from you?

81
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,561
Within a month or two, max.

82
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:46,814
Two months?

83
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:48,482
Not any sooner?

84
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,653
You'll be lucky even if
it's two months from now!

85
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:56,698
I have an appointment.

86
00:10:56,907 --> 00:11:00,452
I'll call you, alright?

87
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,246
I really appreciate it!

88
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,172
Yes?

89
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,341
I'm from the realty...

90
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,724
Hello.
The owner...?

91
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,059
She's inside.

92
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:25,769
Come in.

93
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,898
It's chilly.

94
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,695
It's a bit cold in here.
Is the building old?

95
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,989
We're offering at a very low price.

96
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,992
Here. Take a look at
the going rates...

97
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,037
I think you're not seeing
the full picture here.

98
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:48,208
The owner personally decorated
this whole cafe.

99
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,961
See there...
Ma'am...?!

100
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,299
Ma'am?

101
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:56,425
Yes?

102
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:04,016
How much did you say
I could have the café at?

103
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:22,659
Sorry...

104
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:35,172
Is something wrong?

105
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:40,928
No...

106
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,431
So, you signed the contract
for the café today...?

107
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:49,853
Yeah. If we took out a loan
under your name, it could work...

108
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:52,272
And it's just such a good deal...

109
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:55,234
Wish you'd have told me first...

110
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,281
Your phone was off all day...

111
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,290
I'll wash up first.

112
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:27,766
Sujin.

113
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,727
I need to talk to you.

114
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:37,985
You got fired?!!

115
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:39,695
You're crazy...

116
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,907
- Why did you have to sign...
- Must I serve coffee forever!

117
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,619
Why didn't you tell me
you got fired'?

118
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:51,540
- I was going to find another job...
- We're done.

119
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,125
Sujin!

120
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,545
You said, we just have to
save for three years.

121
00:13:56,753 --> 00:14:02,134
Well, it's been five years.
None of my friends worry about money!

122
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:05,053
They are all married,
living in fancy houses.

123
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:09,808
Have you ever even bought me
a designer bag?!

124
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,395
I was out of my mind...
It's over between us.

125
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:14,396
Sujin!

126
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,857
I mean it!
We're through, Minsoo!

127
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:20,193
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
I got fired!

128
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:26,366
But I swear, I'll get you
the money for the café.

129
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:28,952
How?

130
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,831
How can you get $300,000
before the end of this month?!

131
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:37,836
If you became crippled,
I could still live with you.

132
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:41,298
But I can't be with you
if you're broke.

133
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,510
I told you I'll get the money!

134
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,848
Just wait!

135
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,621
Let's see...

136
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:16,083
150.

137
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,502
150? This is brand new!

138
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,087
There's a scratch. See?

139
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:24,383
Where? It's perfectly fine...

140
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,844
Then take it somewhere else.

141
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:33,600
150, 50,

142
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:36,520
40, 30.

143
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,274
Where did you find this antique piece?

144
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:45,195
Hey! There're security cameras
all over the place these days.

145
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:48,448
Besides, I'm the most consistent
dealer you have.

146
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:50,409
$5.

147
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,956
In total...

148
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,000
$305.

149
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,670
These are nice phones.
$300 is ridiculous.

150
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,588
Who said $300?
I said $305!

151
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,298
Mr. Choi!

152
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,219
Fine, find another buyer!

153
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,438
Hey, open the door for him!

154
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,231
Quick!

155
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:33,452
It's okay. Come in.
He comes here to deal.

156
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,249
You parked the car
where I told you?

157
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,417
Yes.

158
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,002
Good.

159
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:46,590
I'll check it out and
let you know how much by today.

160
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,717
- Okay.
- Good work.

161
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,349
Here. $305.

162
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,186
How much do you give for cars?

163
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,856
- Dream on.
- Excuse me?

164
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,358
You think anyone can steal cars?

165
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,486
A punk like you?

166
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:10,655
There're cameras and the police...

167
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:12,574
You'd get caught in an instant.

168
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,202
- So how much?
- Forget it.

169
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:20,624
I'm not going to jail because of you.
Just get me more cell phones.

170
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:03,708
HELP WANTED

171
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,132
Suited up all good.

172
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:14,094
Seems like you haven't done
work like this before...

173
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:17,055
Just say what you need.
I'll do my best.

174
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:20,016
Okay, then.
Let's get to work.

175
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:22,018
- Hey kid!
- Yes, sir.

176
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:23,395
Tell him what to do.

177
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:26,648
Come this way...

178
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,518
Smell like chicken?

179
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,731
Air freshener helps.

180
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,275
Thanks.

181
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,340
Chauffer service.

182
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:37,177
Yes. Yes.

183
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:55,362
You called for a driver?

184
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,461
You said $20?

185
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,754
Yes.

186
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,758
One. Two.

187
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:21,554
Thank you.

188
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:31,481
Chauffeur service.
Oh. Yes...

189
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:09,287
This should work...

190
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,752
Yeonwoo!

191
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:18,713
What are you doing?

192
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,384
You leave something inside?
Where are the keys?

193
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:25,136
None of your business.

194
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:29,599
Need help?

195
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:33,019
- Give me.
- No, it's fine!

196
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,146
Give me.

197
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:40,109
I used to work at
an insurance company.

198
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,321
Clients often forgot their keys.
I'd open it for them.

199
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:54,040
How did you do that?

200
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,251
Where's your sister?

201
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,966
You have a very bright personality.

202
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:06,427
Who, me? Thank you.

203
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:09,430
Do you like to travel, Sujin?

204
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:12,559
I've travelled to Europe many times.

205
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:17,480
Paris, London, Vienna...
It's quite splendid.

206
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:19,566
Sujin?

207
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:23,862
Travelling? I love it!

208
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,130
You're really not going out?

209
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,508
He's been waiting outside
for six hours now.

210
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:25,465
The man I met today was
really great.

211
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:28,092
And he likes to travel...

212
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:32,263
He asked me to go on a trip with him...

213
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:37,977
Supposedly, Europe is amazing...
Paris... or...

214
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:39,729
Wait for me.

215
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:57,538
You been working at
a chicken shop lately?

216
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:02,251
You smell like chicken meat...

217
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:17,558
Sujin went on the date out of spite...
Don't worry.

218
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:18,726
And...

219
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:20,561
I have something to tell you...

220
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,691
Bro!

221
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:19,912
Hello?

222
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:29,797
Hey, bro!

223
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:34,218
It's weird calling me 'bro'...

224
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,764
You're getting married, soon...
Might as well call you brother...

225
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:39,932
Why'd you want to see me?

226
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:42,518
Is Sujin okay?

227
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:47,690
No, it's nothing like that.
I just wanted to talk with you.

228
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:49,776
Me?

229
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:55,448
Hey... Do you work at a chicken shop?
You stink of raw chicken...

230
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:57,950
Just get to your point.
I gotta shower before work.

231
00:26:58,493 --> 00:27:01,162
Didn't you just get off from work?

232
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:22,350
What do you think?

233
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:24,435
No.

234
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:26,229
Come on!

235
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:38,157
The cars we steal are shipped off
abroad that very day.

236
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:41,744
The police have no way of catching us.
What do you say?

237
00:27:41,953 --> 00:27:43,621
I said, no.

238
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,207
Bro, think about it!

239
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:50,962
The work you're doing now doesn't pay!
And your body reeks of chicken!

240
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,882
Even now, your stench is
no joke, bro. You stink!!

241
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:57,009
I said, no!

242
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:12,525
You called for a driver?

243
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:30,251
Mister! You're going the wrong way!

244
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:33,588
Yeah, he is.

245
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:37,216
Fuck. We don't have time for this!

246
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:39,677
Sorry.

247
00:28:40,887 --> 00:28:44,223
Yo! Doesn't it smell like
chicken in here?

248
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:47,185
Yeah.

249
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:51,731
Hey man! You work at a
chicken farm or something?

250
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:59,697
God, I fucking hate chicken!
Hey! Open the window!

251
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,578
- You said $20?
- Yes.

252
00:29:06,454 --> 00:29:08,080
Here's $20.

253
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:11,292
Hey Mister.

254
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:13,419
I already got it.

255
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:16,255
Mister, you stink.
Go take a shower somewhere.

256
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:14,647
Yeonwoo.

257
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:16,941
You sleeping?

258
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:23,531
You were saying, earlier...

259
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:32,415
Good to hear
you've found a nice job.

260
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:34,125
Here. Count it.

261
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,128
Thanks for everything.

262
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:39,297
Come back if you ever need!

263
00:31:07,325 --> 00:31:08,159
No.

264
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:11,245
- Why?
- There's a camera right above.

265
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:19,128
- How'd you know that?
- I was at an insurance company.

266
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:24,633
Places like this scream trouble.
There're always cameras around.

267
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:28,137
Wow!

268
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:36,520
That one...

269
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:40,191
You sure?

270
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,185
We're here.

271
00:32:16,394 --> 00:32:19,063
If we park here,
they'll come get it.

272
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:05,025
50/50!

273
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:10,906
Uh-oh...

274
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:16,745
No worries.
That one's fake.

275
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:19,748
Wow. You are amazing.

276
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:23,919
We make such a great team.
Should've been nicer to you sooner.

277
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:26,088
We're only doing this for the money.

278
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:28,924
When the time comes, no more...

279
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:31,844
Dude, I think you were born for this!

280
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:36,307
Don't go overboard.
We make the dough, and we're done.

281
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:38,184
Okay...

282
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:41,687
But it's our first paycheck...
We should drink and celebrate!

283
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:42,396
Bye.

284
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:44,440
Bro?

285
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:01,285
Where are you?

286
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:04,913
You think you can go solo today?
Something came up.

287
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:07,082
<i>Or let's just go tomorrow.</i>

288
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:10,711
<i>- Your treat, right?
- Yeah... I'm on the phone!</i>

289
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:14,006
<i>- Yay! It's on him tonight!
- Sorry, bro!</i>

290
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:07,101
Hey! Driver!

291
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,657
You're here early!

292
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:28,664
Let's go!

293
00:37:42,428 --> 00:37:50,310
Hey! Don't mess with me!
Go straight at the intersection!

294
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:57,317
No...

295
00:37:57,651 --> 00:38:01,488
You look like someone I know.

296
00:38:05,868 --> 00:38:12,458
Hey, I told you!
You were supposed to go straight!!

297
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:16,462
Wait a minute...

298
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:19,506
It is you!

299
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:22,509
Minsoo!

300
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:27,181
So you're a chauffeur now?

301
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:33,604
Can't wait to pop this news
at the office tomorrow!

302
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:42,279
Little dipshit! You know
how happy I was to see you go?!

303
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:52,498
I was going crazy seeing
your retarded face every day!

304
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:57,294
You're sooo slow...
And have no sense at all...

305
00:38:59,797 --> 00:39:03,342
Fuck! Where'd you learn
how to drive?!

306
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,343
Get another driver.

307
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:10,015
Hey! What are you doing?
Start the car! Start it!

308
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,935
I told you to get someone else,
fucking asshole!

309
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:16,146
You son-of-a-bitch!
Hey! You little fucker!

310
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:19,149
Used to be a fucking mute
back at the office!

311
00:39:25,072 --> 00:39:26,907
Hey! Fucking retard!

312
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:46,088
News. News!

313
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:51,718
MISSING PERSONS CASE

314
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:56,807
DRIVER MURDERS CUSTOMER

315
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:09,236
<i>Hello...</i>

316
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:11,446
The car from yesterday.
Did you hand it over?

317
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:14,408
Yeah, I took care of it...

318
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,993
You're sure they took it?

319
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:20,497
<i>They were ready to pay...
It's probably abroad by now.</i>

320
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:22,541
<i>Why?</i>

321
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:29,381
Nothing...

322
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:33,593
Sorry, but could you go
by yourself today?

323
00:42:33,844 --> 00:42:37,723
<i>Something came up again...
Just until today, please?</i>

324
00:42:39,725 --> 00:42:41,059
Okay.

325
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:47,644
You called for a driver?

326
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:50,230
What took you so long?

327
00:47:35,645 --> 00:47:37,314
You requested a driver?

328
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:02,482
Bro, I'm sorry.

329
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,901
No worries. Maybe it's
better I work alone.

330
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:07,278
But you know,
it's still 50/50, right?

331
00:49:08,071 --> 00:49:09,614
Yeah.

332
00:49:09,823 --> 00:49:13,993
Hey. Didn't you break open the lock?
How do you have the keys?

333
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:19,833
My secret.
Don't try to know too much.

334
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:24,546
Alright. Do you still work
at the chicken place?

335
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:26,506
No. Why?

336
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:30,135
It's just...
I think I smell blood on you.

337
00:49:31,428 --> 00:49:33,096
Blood?

338
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:39,436
Stop talking crap.
Just go hand the car over on time.

339
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:41,104
Yeap.

340
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:42,522
- Bye.
- Later.

341
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:51,948
Hey! You know how hard
I tried to get you in?

342
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:54,951
You owe me, big time!

343
00:49:55,493 --> 00:50:00,498
I know you went out on a limb for me.
But I actually found another job.

344
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:04,711
Had I foreseen this,
I wouldn't have asked you.

345
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:08,465
Already? What kind of a job?

346
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:16,890
Something that I'm best at.

347
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:51,442
Sujin! A package for you!

348
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:57,073
It looks like a designer bag!

349
00:52:19,721 --> 00:52:21,055
What is this?

350
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:25,768
You always wanted a luxury purse.

351
00:52:26,269 --> 00:52:28,104
It's a Christmas present.

352
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:29,314
You like it?

353
00:52:30,231 --> 00:52:33,568
You can't afford this!
Are you crazy?

354
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:36,529
I didn't take the tag off,
so go return it.

355
00:52:37,697 --> 00:52:39,949
I have money.

356
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:48,124
Did you get a job?

357
00:52:51,002 --> 00:52:52,795
I've missed you...

358
00:52:59,469 --> 00:53:01,971
IFS so pretty!

359
00:53:06,768 --> 00:53:13,358
Wow! It's so nice!

360
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:29,707
Aren't you spending too much
so suddenly?

361
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,241
Minsoo!

362
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,161
Stop!

363
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:10,748
Stop! Minsoo!

364
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:13,751
What are you doing?!

365
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:20,591
Sorry...

366
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:23,636
I just got so excited...

367
00:54:24,095 --> 00:54:26,723
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

368
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,436
What the hell!

369
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:33,688
I'm sorry.

370
00:54:36,524 --> 00:54:39,986
Hey, I'd really like to
visit our café...

371
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:43,948
I just really want to see it.

372
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:48,536
Do you know how hard
it's been for me?

373
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:50,663
I know.

374
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,223
You're not cold?

375
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:58,624
When did you buy this?

376
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:00,334
Why are you in my room?

377
00:57:00,543 --> 00:57:02,503
How did you buy this!

378
00:57:02,712 --> 00:57:03,921
Fm part-timing!

379
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:06,674
Really?

380
00:57:08,384 --> 00:57:10,344
Are you stealing things again?

381
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:11,929
BRO

382
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:18,227
I didn't steal it!
I'm going out!

383
00:57:18,603 --> 00:57:20,313
Yeonwoo!

384
00:57:27,737 --> 00:57:29,322
Bro?

385
00:57:32,742 --> 00:57:35,786
That was Minsoo's number...

386
00:57:42,627 --> 00:57:45,880
I've been worried about Yeonwoo.

387
00:57:46,172 --> 00:57:47,465
Why?

388
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:53,721
I don't know where he's been working,
but he's spending a lot of money...

389
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:58,142
I hope he's not going around
stealing like before...

390
00:57:58,476 --> 00:58:00,436
He's not a little kid...

391
00:58:02,897 --> 00:58:06,359
You think you could talk
with him more, please...?

392
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:08,819
Sure...

393
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:24,835
It's going to be difficult
in that area for some time.

394
00:58:25,044 --> 00:58:25,878
What?

395
00:58:26,087 --> 00:58:27,338
I looked into it.

396
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:31,050
Turns out the police are suddenly
increasing surveillance...

397
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:32,343
Security cameras?

398
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:37,431
Stay low for a while.
Don't move too hastily.

399
00:58:53,656 --> 00:58:55,282
Did you call for a driver?

400
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:58,536
You're here early.

401
00:59:15,386 --> 00:59:16,345
Where you going?

402
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:23,185
You called for a driver?

403
00:59:29,275 --> 00:59:31,944
I swear that wasn't there before...

404
00:59:36,365 --> 00:59:37,366
Hello?

405
00:59:37,575 --> 00:59:41,328
<i>Hey, we're going to have to
take a break for awhile.</i>

406
00:59:41,871 --> 00:59:43,831
<i>Mr. Choi says...</i>

407
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:47,311
Yeonwoo, arrange for
a pick-up tonight.

408
01:00:49,605 --> 01:00:51,440
Don't worry!

409
01:01:42,575 --> 01:01:46,453
Yeonwoo, I'm almost ready...

410
01:01:47,454 --> 01:01:48,873
Yeah...

411
01:01:50,416 --> 01:01:52,376
I told you not to worry...

412
01:01:53,878 --> 01:01:56,672
Tell Mr. Choi he doesn't need to
worry either...

413
01:01:58,132 --> 01:02:02,636
Yeah... Pick-up in <i>2</i> hours
should be fine...

414
01:02:52,353 --> 01:02:54,313
Stop.

415
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:00,361
Stop...

416
01:03:06,659 --> 01:03:09,578
I said, stop,
you crazy son-of-a-bitch!

417
01:03:20,256 --> 01:03:22,341
Crazy bastard.

418
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:51,203
Sister's selling
chestnuts this winter.

419
01:03:51,412 --> 01:03:53,163
Then why are you
dressed like this?

420
01:03:56,917 --> 01:03:58,419
Because it's all about the hat!

421
01:03:58,627 --> 01:04:00,838
Then, what's with the pants?

422
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,132
It's gotta be rustic!

423
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,676
What's that gotta do
with chestnuts?

424
01:04:15,144 --> 01:04:17,938
You look a bit gloomy today.

425
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,316
Is something wrong?

426
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:26,155
Should I quit my job?

427
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:30,367
Why?

428
01:04:31,452 --> 01:04:34,496
You said you were enjoying it.

429
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:37,499
Well, that's true.

430
01:04:39,418 --> 01:04:43,088
You're making good money,
why quit then?

431
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:47,968
I do really enjoy what I do.

432
01:04:49,595 --> 01:04:53,557
But, when I stop,
I feel anxious and guilty.

433
01:04:54,183 --> 01:04:55,726
But I want to work again.

434
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:57,728
It's fun...

435
01:04:57,978 --> 01:05:00,439
You just said you enjoy the work!
Then why quit?

436
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:04,735
You're focused on work too much.
You should go on a vacation...

437
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:10,491
Hey, are you listening?

438
01:05:11,075 --> 01:05:13,327
Sorry.
What were you saying?

439
01:05:13,994 --> 01:05:16,914
You're doing fine,
so why quit?

440
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:19,541
And let's go on a vacation.

441
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:21,752
Minsoo! Where are you going?!

442
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:25,547
Do you know me?

443
01:05:26,215 --> 01:05:28,092
- Excuse me?
- I said, do you know me?

444
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:28,926
No.

445
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:30,427
Then why do you keep staring?!

446
01:05:30,886 --> 01:05:31,512
What?

447
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:32,679
What's going on, Minsoo?

448
01:05:32,888 --> 01:05:34,932
If you don't know me,
stop staring at me!

449
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:38,435
I wasn't looking at you.
I was looking at the books, behind you.

450
01:05:38,644 --> 01:05:41,855
Minsoo, stop, seriously!
I'm so sorry.

451
01:05:42,064 --> 01:05:43,399
“I MAKE MONEY THE GOOD WAY"

452
01:07:35,052 --> 01:07:36,720
Crazy bastard.

453
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:32,002
Fuck!

454
01:11:27,367 --> 01:11:28,243
Yes?

455
01:11:28,452 --> 01:11:29,703
<i>Where are you?</i>

456
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:31,413
Now?

457
01:11:32,164 --> 01:11:33,415
I handed the car over
in the morning.

458
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:35,333
<i>Get over here, now!</i>

459
01:11:38,128 --> 01:11:39,171
Okay.

460
01:12:05,572 --> 01:12:06,990
Hello?

461
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:10,243
<i>Minsoo, it's urgent,
you gotta get over here.</i>

462
01:13:09,678 --> 01:13:11,513
It's him!

463
01:13:12,848 --> 01:13:14,933
Where's our boss?

464
01:15:06,753 --> 01:15:07,837
Minsoo...

465
01:15:08,046 --> 01:15:10,882
Have you been killing people
all along?

466
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:15,095
We have to report...
Or... go confess to the cops!

467
01:15:15,303 --> 01:15:16,262
What if we get caught and...

468
01:15:16,471 --> 01:15:17,597
We won't.

469
01:15:17,889 --> 01:15:19,265
What?

470
01:15:20,475 --> 01:15:21,726
We won't get caught!

471
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:25,897
How do you know that?
How?

472
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:29,109
I just know.
We're not going to get caught.

473
01:15:35,532 --> 01:15:38,284
We should turn ourselves in...

474
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:40,120
Me?

475
01:15:42,247 --> 01:15:43,748
Why?

476
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:50,130
I've never had this much fun in my life.

477
01:15:51,006 --> 01:15:53,049
I was never good at studying,

478
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:56,886
nor was I any good at work.

479
01:15:57,762 --> 01:15:58,847
But...

480
01:16:01,474 --> 01:16:04,310
I think I have an innate skill
for killing people...

481
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:07,731
You know, like a gift?

482
01:16:09,357 --> 01:16:11,151
It's good for you, too.

483
01:16:11,526 --> 01:16:14,362
And I get to make money
doing what I like.

484
01:16:15,363 --> 01:16:17,574
You're crazy.

485
01:16:21,995 --> 01:16:24,330
I'm going to go to the police.

486
01:16:25,874 --> 01:16:27,500
Wait.

487
01:16:31,212 --> 01:16:37,594
You think they'll believe
I did it single-handedly?

488
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:41,931
You're an accomplice.

489
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:44,059
I didn't kill anyone...

490
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:49,355
And who would believe you?
You took half our earnings...

491
01:16:50,523 --> 01:16:52,067
But, still...

492
01:16:55,111 --> 01:16:56,988
You think this world is so easy?

493
01:16:58,114 --> 01:17:00,200
- We can just find someone else...
- And what if we get caught?

494
01:17:00,408 --> 01:17:02,619
We're not going to get caught!!!
We won't!!!

495
01:17:05,497 --> 01:17:08,750
So you better believe it, too!

496
01:17:09,209 --> 01:17:14,255
I told you I was gifted.
We won't get caught!!!

497
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:28,228
<i>The police are carrying out investigations
surrounding a dead body found last night.</i>

498
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:32,482
<i>They see gang rivalry
as a likely cause for this incident,</i>

499
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:35,902
<i>and are questioning suspects
at the moment.</i>

500
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:09,394
Yeonwoo! Jeong Yeonwoo!

501
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:13,314
Open the door!
What's wrong?!!

502
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:15,650
Yeonwoo!

503
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:24,492
Minsoo.

504
01:18:24,701 --> 01:18:25,869
Is something wrong?

505
01:18:26,077 --> 01:18:28,246
Yeonwoo won't come out of his room.

506
01:18:34,252 --> 01:18:38,506
Yeonwoo! Open the door...

507
01:18:41,134 --> 01:18:43,553
See, he won't come out!

508
01:19:03,281 --> 01:19:06,201
What's the matter?
Are you sick?

509
01:19:06,993 --> 01:19:09,662
No, I just want to be alone...

510
01:19:14,292 --> 01:19:16,794
But you should still eat something.

511
01:19:17,170 --> 01:19:18,796
You even locked the door...

512
01:19:19,005 --> 01:19:21,424
Hey, I'm not a little teenager!

513
01:19:32,393 --> 01:19:34,354
It's a ticket to Paris, France.

514
01:19:35,021 --> 01:19:37,273
Go backpacking or something.

515
01:19:45,365 --> 01:19:46,908
Why?

516
01:19:47,408 --> 01:19:49,994
A plane ticket all of a sudden?

517
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:54,332
I've always wanted to
send him on a trip...

518
01:19:54,916 --> 01:19:57,752
Don't think about anything,
and just go travel.

519
01:19:58,002 --> 01:19:59,963
I'll cover your expenses.

520
01:20:00,755 --> 01:20:04,717
What kind of work
do you exactly do?

521
01:20:08,846 --> 01:20:10,723
- And it's so sudden...
- I'll go!

522
01:20:11,432 --> 01:20:14,602
I want to go.

523
01:20:38,543 --> 01:20:40,169
Hey sis. I'll be back.

524
01:20:40,378 --> 01:20:41,838
Call when you arrive.

525
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:43,840
Okay.

526
01:21:28,301 --> 01:21:30,094
You dropped Yeonwoo off
at the airport alright?

527
01:21:30,303 --> 01:21:31,554
Yeah.

528
01:21:32,096 --> 01:21:33,097
Where's the owner?

529
01:21:33,306 --> 01:21:35,224
She went out to buy
some groceries.

530
01:21:35,892 --> 01:21:38,394
- So this is the café?
- Yup.

531
01:21:44,275 --> 01:21:46,819
- They even have a camera here.
- Of course.

532
01:21:47,028 --> 01:21:49,280
Can't imagine working without it!

533
01:21:52,450 --> 01:21:54,744
It's almost the New Year.

534
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:58,539
With Yeonwoo gone, I'll
feel so lonely. I'm worried.

535
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,043
Then...

536
01:22:03,586 --> 01:22:05,254
How about we go on a trip too?

537
01:22:06,714 --> 01:22:08,257
Tomorrow's your day off, right?

538
01:22:08,508 --> 01:22:09,759
Really?

539
01:22:11,636 --> 01:22:13,262
What about your work?

540
01:22:14,055 --> 01:22:15,556
I have to rest too.

541
01:22:16,307 --> 01:22:17,558
You wanted me to.

542
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:21,979
Really?

543
01:22:24,065 --> 01:22:26,275
I'll come pick you up
tomorrow morning.

544
01:23:52,904 --> 01:23:54,405
Minsoo!

545
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:57,116
This whole place,
just for the two of us?

546
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:03,039
'Til the boat comes tomorrow,
it's all ours!

547
01:24:03,498 --> 01:24:05,458
Nice.

548
01:24:28,105 --> 01:24:29,482
What's up?

549
01:24:30,066 --> 01:24:34,028
I wonder if Yeonwoo's okay.
He's not answering.

550
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:36,447
His phone's prolly dead.

551
01:24:36,656 --> 01:24:38,658
He called to say
he arrived safely.

552
01:24:38,866 --> 01:24:41,911
Really?
He got there okay?

553
01:25:01,806 --> 01:25:02,765
Turning!

554
01:25:03,391 --> 01:25:05,351
Let me down!

555
01:25:11,983 --> 01:25:13,943
Wow. Beautiful!

556
01:25:24,495 --> 01:25:27,540
No, my brother is
in Paris right now.

557
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:32,086
Yes. I understand.

558
01:25:34,255 --> 01:25:35,423
Who called?

559
01:25:38,551 --> 01:25:39,802
The police.

560
01:25:41,304 --> 01:25:42,471
The police?

561
01:25:43,222 --> 01:25:44,181
Why?

562
01:25:44,849 --> 01:25:48,144
They found a body.
And think it's Yeonwoo.

563
01:25:48,853 --> 01:25:51,606
You really spoke with my brother,
right?

564
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:55,151
Don't worry.
It's probably a look-alike.

565
01:25:55,359 --> 01:25:59,113
I saw him enter the departure gate,
and I even answered his call.

566
01:26:00,865 --> 01:26:02,199
Right?

567
01:26:02,783 --> 01:26:05,244
Right... You're right.

568
01:26:07,246 --> 01:26:10,583
He's probably having a
good time right now...

569
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:17,256
Don't worry.

570
01:26:34,148 --> 01:26:37,234
Wish we could stay longer.

571
01:26:37,902 --> 01:26:40,071
Let's do this more often.

572
01:26:41,238 --> 01:26:42,657
Really?

573
01:26:46,994 --> 01:26:48,788
Happy New Year, honey.

574
01:26:49,288 --> 01:26:51,499
You too, sweetie.

575
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:13,080
Minsoo?

576
01:28:15,082 --> 01:28:16,709
Are you crying?

577
01:28:52,870 --> 01:28:54,413
You're awake?

578
01:28:54,622 --> 01:28:56,791
I woke you up. Sorry.

579
01:28:57,708 --> 01:29:00,002
My battery is out.

580
01:29:00,377 --> 01:29:02,671
Where's my charger?

581
01:29:03,798 --> 01:29:07,176
It'll be light out soon...
Look for it then...

582
01:29:07,384 --> 01:29:10,596
No, Yeonwoo might call.

583
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:13,474
And I'm not even sleepy.

584
01:29:15,059 --> 01:29:17,937
I swore I brought it.

585
01:29:20,523 --> 01:29:22,942
I'm going to check the car.

586
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:39,708
Brr, it's cold.

587
01:30:03,399 --> 01:30:05,818
I knew I brought it.

588
01:30:22,126 --> 01:30:23,252
Did you find it?

589
01:30:23,961 --> 01:30:27,256
Minsoo, isn't this
Yeonwoo's phone?

590
01:30:30,259 --> 01:30:32,052
You said he called you earlier!

591
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:44,315
Sujin...

592
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:52,197
It's not what you think...

593
01:30:54,658 --> 01:30:56,577
I can explain.

594
01:30:59,705 --> 01:31:00,873
Minsoo?

595
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:06,128
Sujin.

596
01:31:08,547 --> 01:31:09,798
Sujin.

597
01:31:10,341 --> 01:31:11,258
Sujin.

598
01:32:37,594 --> 01:32:39,221
Sujin.

599
01:32:43,142 --> 01:32:46,061
Don't hide. Please listen.
Sujin.

600
01:33:40,699 --> 01:33:42,076
Sujin! Don't do this!

601
01:33:42,284 --> 01:33:45,120
Listen to me!!
Please!!!

602
01:34:46,932 --> 01:34:48,517
Call the police.

603
01:34:49,268 --> 01:34:51,228
I'll be inside.

604
01:35:41,904 --> 01:35:44,448
