1
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,509
It'll be two quid.

2
00:02:06,882 --> 00:02:08,814
Shut the door.

3
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,799
No!

4
00:05:00,904 --> 00:05:03,302
- What's going on here?
- Murder.

5
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:06,097
- No.
- One of the girls.

6
00:05:21,836 --> 00:05:23,768
What paper are you from?

7
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:30,356
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, what paper are you from?

8
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:34,129
- Oh. The Observer.
- Oh.

9
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:26,963
Come on. Let's take
a photograph of you.

10
00:06:27,031 --> 00:06:31,053
- I can't help thinking
of that poor girl.
- Shocking, isn't it?

11
00:06:51,063 --> 00:06:53,791
- You're late.
- Sorry, sir.

12
00:06:53,864 --> 00:06:57,421
Hold on, Mark.
I've got a question for you.

13
00:06:57,497 --> 00:07:00,327
Which magazine sells
the most copies?

14
00:07:00,396 --> 00:07:03,021
Those with girls
on the front covers...

15
00:07:03,096 --> 00:07:05,118
and no front covers
on the girls.

16
00:07:05,195 --> 00:07:08,252
- Exactly. It's just the same
with the work you do for me.

17
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:10,954
Look busy.

18
00:07:11,028 --> 00:07:14,119
- The Times, please. Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

19
00:07:17,828 --> 00:07:21,283
- Anything else, sir?
- And the Telegraph.

20
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:28,650
Anything else?

21
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:33,056
I'm told by a friend
that you have some views for sale.

22
00:07:33,127 --> 00:07:35,616
- What sort of views, sir?
- Hmm?

23
00:07:35,694 --> 00:07:38,489
Well...

24
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,493
This sort, sir?

25
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,081
Yes, thank you.
Yes.

26
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,948
- Morning, Mr. Peter.
- Morning.

27
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:57,457
- Can I have a Crunch, please?
- Help yourself, my dear.

28
00:07:57,526 --> 00:08:01,458
Thank you.

29
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:05,121
- How much each?
- They're five shillings each, sir.

30
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:07,521
Oh, well, I'll have
that one. Yeah.

31
00:08:07,592 --> 00:08:09,524
Oh, and that.

32
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:17,417
- How much would the lot be?
- To you, five pounds, sir.

33
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:20,481
- Five pounds.
- Well, uh, I'll tell you what, sir.

34
00:08:20,557 --> 00:08:22,490
I'll make it
four pounds ten.

35
00:08:22,557 --> 00:08:24,988
And I'll throw in the Times
and the Telegraph. How's that?

36
00:08:25,057 --> 00:08:30,149
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
Let me wrap it for you, sir.

37
00:08:30,224 --> 00:08:33,088
- Shall I... Shall I put you
on our mailing list?
- Oh, no.

38
00:08:33,157 --> 00:08:36,055
No. No. No.
I'll-I'll look in again.

39
00:08:36,124 --> 00:08:38,681
Very well, sir.

40
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:43,954
Thank you.

41
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:52,985
- Oh, uh, your papers, sir.
- Papers?

42
00:08:53,056 --> 00:08:56,647
- Times and Telegraph.
- Oh, yes. Of course.

43
00:08:56,722 --> 00:08:59,517
Silly of me.
Thank you very much, sir.

44
00:09:07,654 --> 00:09:11,608
- Well, he won't be doing
the crossword tonight.

45
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,513
Well, look who's here.
Cecil Beaton.

46
00:09:33,153 --> 00:09:35,618
Her name is Lorraine.

47
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:05,940
Well, come on, sonny.
Make us famous.

48
00:10:09,383 --> 00:10:11,815
Did you read about that girl
that was murdered last night?

49
00:10:11,884 --> 00:10:14,748
Same thing nearly
happened to me.

50
00:10:14,817 --> 00:10:17,806
- Oh? When?
- Last night.

51
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:21,281
I went out with my boyfriend.
Getting married next month.

52
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,509
Trouble was
my fiancé saw us.

53
00:10:28,082 --> 00:10:31,014
Can you fix it so
the bruises don't show?

54
00:10:34,616 --> 00:10:37,639
- Well, can you?
- I think so, Milly.

55
00:10:37,716 --> 00:10:40,307
Be quick about it, sonny.
I'm melting.

56
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:53,806
There he goes again. What have
you got under there? A girlfriend?

57
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,972
I suppose you have
a girlfriend.

58
00:10:58,047 --> 00:11:01,843
- No, Milly.
- Hear that, Lorraine? He's available.

59
00:11:01,913 --> 00:11:05,844
Raise your head
and look at the sea, please.

60
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:08,401
What sea?

61
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,945
What sea?

62
00:11:11,012 --> 00:11:14,035
- I just wanted that puzzled look.
- Oh, did you?

63
00:11:14,113 --> 00:11:16,636
Well, if you want it again,
I'll think of you.

64
00:11:16,713 --> 00:11:21,645
- Hold it.
- You're a puzzle and a half.

65
00:11:25,145 --> 00:11:30,339
- This is a spare-time job for you,
isn't it?
- Yes, Milly.

66
00:11:33,978 --> 00:11:36,910
Well, what do you do
for a living?

67
00:11:38,612 --> 00:11:42,066
- Take pictures.
- This sort?

68
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,333
No, Milly.

69
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:56,342
- On the house.
- Some house.

70
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:59,275
Hope it falls
on his ruddy earhole.

71
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:02,435
It's your turn now, love.

72
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,101
It's her first time.

73
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:12,267
Come on, love.
Don't be shy.

74
00:12:21,443 --> 00:12:24,965
He said you needn't
photograph my face.

75
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:31,769
I want to.

76
00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:43,897
Maybe you can fix
my bruises too.

77
00:12:47,372 --> 00:12:50,805
- I want to.
- What about the customers?

78
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,801
Don't be shy... of me.

79
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:58,033
It's my first time too.

80
00:12:58,107 --> 00:13:01,130
Yours?

81
00:13:01,207 --> 00:13:05,501
In front of eyes like...

82
00:13:05,572 --> 00:13:08,061
Eyes as full of...

83
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,503
Twenty-one!

84
00:13:27,571 --> 00:13:31,298
# Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you #

85
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,302
# Happy birthday, dear Helen #

86
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,302
# Happy birthday to you ##

87
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,894
- Thank you.
- Come on, blow! One, two, three!

88
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:46,101
What's that?

89
00:13:51,837 --> 00:13:56,496
- You must be very proud
of your daughter, Mrs. Stephens.
- Mmm.

90
00:14:05,335 --> 00:14:07,267
I say. Look.

91
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:19,165
It's that chap
from upstairs.

92
00:14:33,633 --> 00:14:37,121
Hello. I don't know how many times
we've passed each other on the stairs,

93
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,292
but tonight I'm determined at least
to say hello to you, so, hello.

94
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,731
I'm Helen Stephens.
I'm having a party,

95
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,821
and the other tenants are there
and a few friends.

96
00:14:47,898 --> 00:14:50,887
We'd like you to join us.

97
00:14:50,965 --> 00:14:53,659
- I'm Mark.
- Pardon?

98
00:14:55,466 --> 00:14:58,125
- I am Mark.
- Oh, hello, Mark.

99
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,892
Please come in. You'll meet
the others who live here and...

100
00:15:00,965 --> 00:15:03,987
Sorry, but... work.

101
00:15:04,064 --> 00:15:07,189
Oh, well, I hope to keep it
going for ages yet,

102
00:15:07,264 --> 00:15:10,094
so when you finish,
why not look in...

103
00:15:10,164 --> 00:15:14,494
- Mark?
- Come on, Helen. The cake.
Everyone's waiting.

104
00:15:18,498 --> 00:15:20,430
Hap-Happy birthday.

105
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:08,554
A minute.

106
00:16:29,592 --> 00:16:32,649
Oh I... I hope I'm not
disturbing you.

107
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,089
I knew you wouldn't
come down, so...

108
00:16:37,026 --> 00:16:39,355
I brought you this.

109
00:16:39,425 --> 00:16:43,516
Thank you... very much.

110
00:16:43,591 --> 00:16:47,523
Well, I-I mustn’t
keep you from your work.

111
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:51,614
- Oh, would you...
- Oh, thank you.

112
00:16:56,858 --> 00:17:00,881
- I'd like to offer you a drink.
- Oh, thank you.

113
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:09,155
- I haven't got one.
- Oh, well, I'd adore some water.

114
00:17:09,223 --> 00:17:12,917
You see, a hostess can't
drink water at her own party.

115
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,421
It looks like
a hint to the guests.

116
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,718
- There's milk if you'd like some.
- Oh, very much, if you can spare it.

117
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,915
- Oh, yes.
- Thank you.

118
00:17:27,856 --> 00:17:31,016
- Here.
- Oh, thank you very much.

119
00:17:34,989 --> 00:17:39,545
This is a nice room,
and is there another inside?

120
00:17:41,354 --> 00:17:45,683
- Yes.
- How long have you lived here?

121
00:17:45,754 --> 00:17:49,584
- Nearly all my life.
I-I was born in this house.
- Oh?

122
00:17:51,387 --> 00:17:55,319
- It's my father's.
- Do you mean at last I've
found out who our landlord is?

123
00:17:55,387 --> 00:17:58,285
Your father?

124
00:17:58,353 --> 00:18:02,614
Well, no. He-He's dead.
I'm the landlord.

125
00:18:02,686 --> 00:18:04,618
- You?
- Yes.

126
00:18:04,686 --> 00:18:06,777
But you walk about as if
you haven't paid the rent.

127
00:18:08,152 --> 00:18:10,982
- I haven't.
- Oh, I-I meant...

128
00:18:11,052 --> 00:18:12,984
I know.

129
00:18:13,052 --> 00:18:16,143
It's his house,
and I'll never sell it.

130
00:18:16,219 --> 00:18:18,583
But I can't afford the upkeep,
so I let rooms.

131
00:18:20,219 --> 00:18:24,116
If I charge you too much, please
tell me, and I-I'll tell the agents.

132
00:18:24,185 --> 00:18:26,378
The rent's very reasonable,
but don't say anything to the others...

133
00:18:26,452 --> 00:18:29,316
or you'll have no peace.

134
00:18:29,385 --> 00:18:34,147
- Peace.
- Mark, what do you do?

135
00:18:35,585 --> 00:18:39,608
- Oh, thank you.
- Most of the time,
I work in a film studio.

136
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,616
On the photographic side
I'll bet.

137
00:18:41,684 --> 00:18:44,808
- I hope to be a director very soon.
- Oh, how exciting.

138
00:18:44,883 --> 00:18:47,441
When I came in, were you
looking at some films?

139
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:50,108
- Yes.
- Of yours?

140
00:18:50,184 --> 00:18:52,116
- Yes.
- I'd like to see them.

141
00:18:52,184 --> 00:18:54,741
Oh, I know
I'm being rude,

142
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:56,749
but I really would like
to see them.

143
00:18:56,817 --> 00:19:00,250
It would be a birthday present
from you to me.

144
00:19:00,317 --> 00:19:02,747
- Would it?
- Mmm.

145
00:19:02,816 --> 00:19:07,340
- Oh.
- But I'm-I'm sure you're too busy and...

146
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,473
Will you...

147
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:15,138
- Would you like to see them now?
- Oh, thank you.

148
00:19:18,483 --> 00:19:20,743
I'll go first.

149
00:19:28,481 --> 00:19:31,571
Oh, it's dark.

150
00:19:31,647 --> 00:19:35,478
Is that better?

151
00:19:35,547 --> 00:19:38,945
But it's enormous.

152
00:19:39,014 --> 00:19:42,877
Oh. Terribly sorry.

153
00:19:46,846 --> 00:19:49,607
- What are these?
- Chemicals.

154
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,611
Oh.

155
00:19:57,346 --> 00:20:00,936
This is, well...
It's so many things, but...

156
00:20:01,012 --> 00:20:05,603
above all, it's so
completely unexpected.

157
00:20:15,578 --> 00:20:18,510
- These all yours?
- Yes.

158
00:20:18,578 --> 00:20:22,339
I mean, did you
do all this?

159
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:25,104
Mark, tell me
about this room.

160
00:20:25,178 --> 00:20:27,871
- It-It belonged to my father.
- Oh?

161
00:20:27,944 --> 00:20:31,069
- What was he?
- A scientist.

162
00:20:31,144 --> 00:20:34,439
Oh. Then this
equipment was his?

163
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,204
No, I-I sold his
to buy it.

164
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,210
- Sit down.
- Oh!

165
00:20:39,277 --> 00:20:42,765
This all seems so,
well, terribly technical.

166
00:20:42,843 --> 00:20:46,775
If this is where you work,
I can't wait to see what you work at.

167
00:20:48,143 --> 00:20:50,075
Mark?

168
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:56,974
- Don't know what to show you.
- Well, what were you looking at
when I interrupted you?

169
00:20:57,043 --> 00:20:59,304
All right.

170
00:21:49,138 --> 00:21:51,070
Helen,

171
00:21:51,138 --> 00:21:56,765
this is the first 21st birthday present
I'll ever have given.

172
00:21:58,072 --> 00:22:01,060
And it's the first
I've ever asked for.

173
00:22:07,771 --> 00:22:09,703
Thank you.

174
00:22:26,603 --> 00:22:29,228
Mark, what
a beautiful little boy.

175
00:22:29,303 --> 00:22:32,531
- Who is he?
- Me.

176
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:34,864
Of course it is.

177
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:39,596
- Then who took this film?
- My father.

178
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,099
What a wonderful idea.

179
00:22:42,168 --> 00:22:44,100
You'll be able to show it
to your own chil...

180
00:22:44,168 --> 00:22:47,827
Oh, you must've had
a bad dream.

181
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:50,390
What was the light
in your eye?

182
00:22:50,468 --> 00:22:53,763
Camera, I suppose.

183
00:22:59,867 --> 00:23:02,661
Whatever are you after?

184
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:17,466
Naughty boy.
I hope you were spanked.

185
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:28,389
Mark, what a strange thing
for your father to photograph.

186
00:23:28,465 --> 00:23:30,398
- Switch it off?
- No.

187
00:23:30,465 --> 00:23:33,761
No.

188
00:23:38,965 --> 00:23:40,896
Again?

189
00:23:42,165 --> 00:23:44,892
Mark, this isn't
some sort of a joke, is it?

190
00:23:45,697 --> 00:23:49,027
No, Helen.

191
00:23:58,431 --> 00:24:02,295
What's that?

192
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:16,928
- Mark, what are you doing?
- Wanted to photograph you watching.

193
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:20,723
No. No. Please help me
to understand this thing.

194
00:24:32,162 --> 00:24:34,923
That will do, Mark.

195
00:24:34,995 --> 00:24:39,790
Dry your eyes
and stop being silly.

196
00:24:42,693 --> 00:24:44,989
All right now, Mark.
What was all that about?

197
00:24:45,061 --> 00:24:47,526
That was a lizard,
wasn't it, or a...

198
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,383
A li...

199
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,585
Well, how'd it
get there, Mark?

200
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,853
How did it get there?
Was it a pet?

201
00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:06,489
- Not mine.
- Won't you try to explain?

202
00:25:08,092 --> 00:25:11,422
- You better go.
- I'd like to understand what I'm shown.

203
00:25:11,492 --> 00:25:14,458
What was your father trying to do
to you, photographing you at night?

204
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:28,651
You better go.

205
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:46,745
Mark, what's this?

206
00:25:46,824 --> 00:25:49,221
I'm saying good-bye...

207
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:54,382
to my... mother.

208
00:25:56,424 --> 00:25:58,617
He photographed that?

209
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,678
Yes.

210
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:05,945
And this:
Her funeral.

211
00:26:06,021 --> 00:26:08,453
And this:
Her burial.

212
00:26:08,522 --> 00:26:11,885
- And this.
- Who's that?

213
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:15,250
Her successor.

214
00:26:15,321 --> 00:26:18,310
Successor?

215
00:26:26,521 --> 00:26:31,953
He married her six weeks after the...
previous sequence.

216
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:38,818
She filmed
what comes now.

217
00:26:39,986 --> 00:26:42,781
It's out of focus.

218
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:46,114
Is that your father?

219
00:26:46,186 --> 00:26:51,084
The morning he left
for his honeymoon.

220
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:56,615
But what's he doing?

221
00:26:56,685 --> 00:26:59,276
Giving me a present.

222
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:01,284
What is it?

223
00:27:01,352 --> 00:27:03,341
Can't you guess?

224
00:27:06,352 --> 00:27:09,216
The camera.

225
00:27:29,517 --> 00:27:32,109
Switch it off, Mark!

226
00:27:33,383 --> 00:27:36,009
Mark, switch it off!

227
00:27:41,482 --> 00:27:43,471
Let's get out of here.

228
00:27:43,549 --> 00:27:45,480
Mark?

229
00:27:58,249 --> 00:28:00,180
So, he was a scientist?

230
00:28:00,247 --> 00:28:03,236
What kind
of a scientist, Mark?

231
00:28:03,313 --> 00:28:07,609
- Biologist.
- What was he trying to do to you?

232
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,271
Mark, what was he trying
to do to you?

233
00:28:10,347 --> 00:28:14,302
Watch me grow up.

234
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,312
He wanted a record
of a growing child,

235
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:21,005
complete in
every detail,

236
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,545
if such a thing
were possible.

237
00:28:23,613 --> 00:28:28,477
And he tried to make it possible
by training a camera on me at all times.

238
00:28:28,546 --> 00:28:32,535
I never knew the whole of my childhood
one moment's privacy.

239
00:28:32,613 --> 00:28:36,841
And those lights in your eyes
and that thing.

240
00:28:36,913 --> 00:28:39,241
He was interested
in the reactions...

241
00:28:39,311 --> 00:28:43,243
of the nervous system
to... to fear.

242
00:28:43,311 --> 00:28:45,402
Fear?

243
00:28:46,945 --> 00:28:48,877
Fear.

244
00:28:53,211 --> 00:28:58,905
Especially fear in children
and how they react to it.

245
00:28:58,978 --> 00:29:02,569
I think he learned
a lot from me.

246
00:29:02,644 --> 00:29:05,235
I'd wake up
sometimes screaming.

247
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:10,072
He'd be there
taking notes and pictures,

248
00:29:10,144 --> 00:29:12,770
and I'm sure good
came of it...

249
00:29:12,844 --> 00:29:15,173
for some people.

250
00:29:15,244 --> 00:29:19,005
- He was brilliant.
- A scientist drops a lizard
onto a child's bed,

251
00:29:19,076 --> 00:29:21,008
and good comes of it?

252
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:33,808
Excuse me, but...

253
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:35,841
Oh, there you are, Helen.

254
00:29:35,908 --> 00:29:37,931
The party looks like breaking up,
and we were wondering if...

255
00:29:38,008 --> 00:29:40,371
Oh, I'm coming.

256
00:29:40,441 --> 00:29:43,271
I wish you'd join us.

257
00:29:43,341 --> 00:29:46,136
Thank you.
Work.

258
00:29:46,207 --> 00:29:49,731
I hope that you...

259
00:29:49,807 --> 00:29:52,171
have a sweet tooth.

260
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:54,934
Thank you for my present.

261
00:29:55,007 --> 00:29:57,064
Good night, Mark.

262
00:29:57,141 --> 00:29:59,072
Good night, old boy.

263
00:30:13,073 --> 00:30:15,403
Cut!

264
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:22,132
Look, I tell you, Mr. Jarvis, this
picture is a commercial proposition,

265
00:30:22,205 --> 00:30:26,297
and that's why I want you
to do it because I know it's
the type of thing you handle.

266
00:30:26,372 --> 00:30:30,099
Look, you know I've talked
to Johnnie already. I've talked
to him, and he's crazy to do it.

267
00:30:30,172 --> 00:30:33,070
These are the figures
you wanted, Mr. Jarvis.

268
00:30:33,139 --> 00:30:35,332
Oh, it's terrific, Mr. Jarvis.
This script is gonna...

269
00:30:35,406 --> 00:30:38,893
- Still behind schedule.
...way back where it belongs.

270
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:40,903
And you know
that Paramount want it.

271
00:30:40,971 --> 00:30:44,664
Yeah. Paramount want it.
MGM want it. Columbia want it.

272
00:30:44,737 --> 00:30:47,862
- But is it commercial?
- Anglo want it.

273
00:30:47,937 --> 00:30:50,767
Send me a memo.
We'll discuss it next week.

274
00:30:50,837 --> 00:30:53,030
Now, Miss Simpson,
take a memo:

275
00:30:53,104 --> 00:30:56,127
To all producers
and directors.

276
00:30:56,204 --> 00:30:58,362
In light
of the new economy drive,

277
00:30:58,437 --> 00:31:00,868
if you can see it and hear it,
the first take's okay.

278
00:31:00,936 --> 00:31:03,232
Slate 99, take 49.
Clappers on end.

279
00:31:05,103 --> 00:31:07,534
And darling,
just this once,

280
00:31:07,602 --> 00:31:10,262
will you please make an effort
to forget that you're stunning,

281
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,858
and just try
to look stunned?

282
00:31:12,935 --> 00:31:14,867
One kind word
and I would be.

283
00:31:14,935 --> 00:31:16,867
All right.
Positions, everybody.

284
00:31:16,935 --> 00:31:20,094
Cut.
Roll once again, please.

285
00:31:20,168 --> 00:31:22,100
No, no, no, dear.

286
00:31:22,168 --> 00:31:24,100
Cut. Cut.
Cut it.

287
00:31:24,168 --> 00:31:26,395
- Slate 99, take 53.
We'll run it once more, please.

288
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:29,229
Cut it!
Once again, please.

289
00:31:29,301 --> 00:31:31,664
If I have to faint once more,
I will faint.

290
00:31:31,734 --> 00:31:34,064
- Slate 99, take 57.
All right. Quiet, everybody.

291
00:31:34,135 --> 00:31:36,067
All right. Action!

292
00:31:36,135 --> 00:31:41,157
No, no, no, no, no. Cut it.
Cut it. Cut it. It's hopeless.

293
00:31:43,433 --> 00:31:45,661
- Oh, miss.
- Cut!

294
00:31:45,733 --> 00:31:50,098
- Cut! How was it?
Phil? Sam? Mark?

295
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:53,826
Print it!
Hold take one.

296
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,491
- Okay. Alex, that's it.
- All right, boys and girls. Wrap it up.

297
00:31:56,566 --> 00:32:00,793
8:30 in the morning. You're wonderful,
darling. You were really feeling it.

298
00:32:03,866 --> 00:32:09,026
- Catching the bus?
- Not tonight.
Meeting someone for a drink.

299
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:11,656
Oh. I wanted to discuss
that film at the Everyman.

300
00:32:11,732 --> 00:32:13,664
- Tomorrow then?
- I hope so.

301
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:18,595
- How's my favorite stand-in today, huh?
- Standing it.

302
00:32:18,664 --> 00:32:20,596
8:30 in the morning.

303
00:32:20,664 --> 00:32:23,687
Viv, how about having a drink
with me on the way home?

304
00:32:23,765 --> 00:32:26,424
I've got a date,
Mr. Tate.

305
00:32:35,698 --> 00:32:38,094
Good night,
Miss Vivian.

306
00:32:47,263 --> 00:32:50,194
Yeah, Sergeant,
who's working late tonight then?

307
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:52,455
That Indian picture,
The Elephant with Two Tails.

308
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:54,994
- A bit crowded, aren't you?
- She'll take eight at a pinch.

309
00:32:55,062 --> 00:32:57,187
- Which is what we'll probably get.
- Go on.

310
00:32:57,262 --> 00:33:01,023
Well, I don't mind. Might as well get
pinched in a car as squeezed in a bus.

311
00:35:38,618 --> 00:35:40,550
Mark?

312
00:36:23,749 --> 00:36:25,681
Mark?

313
00:36:34,115 --> 00:36:36,343
Mark!

314
00:36:44,814 --> 00:36:46,746
Well, are you there?

315
00:36:50,514 --> 00:36:55,503
- Well, where are you?
- Here, Viv.

316
00:37:00,613 --> 00:37:03,738
Oh, you frightened me.
Now listen.

317
00:37:03,812 --> 00:37:05,801
They're working late
on the lot.

318
00:37:05,879 --> 00:37:09,073
I know. They've branched
off this stage.

319
00:37:09,146 --> 00:37:13,169
- We're using their power.
- We must call it off.
They're bound to see us.

320
00:37:13,246 --> 00:37:17,973
They might, but they won't
interrupt us while we're filming.

321
00:37:19,712 --> 00:37:23,303
- I've put the red light on.
- You've what?

322
00:37:23,379 --> 00:37:26,368
- I've put the red light on. Would you...
- But...

323
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:28,876
Would you please stand
over there?

324
00:37:28,945 --> 00:37:32,537
But then they'll know
someone's here.

325
00:37:32,612 --> 00:37:36,634
- They won't come in.
- Well, they'll wait outside.
What's the difference?

326
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:40,473
The difference is
a perfect film.

327
00:37:40,544 --> 00:37:46,374
I've waited a long time
for this and so have you.

328
00:37:46,444 --> 00:37:50,773
- No one must interrupt it.
- We'll be caught.

329
00:37:50,844 --> 00:37:54,037
- What does that matter?
- Oh, matter!

330
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:58,405
- You stand to lose a job as an extra.
- Extra? Stand-in.

331
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:00,634
I stand to lose nothing.

332
00:38:03,608 --> 00:38:07,507
The result must be
so perfect...

333
00:38:07,575 --> 00:38:10,235
that the risks don't count.

334
00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:13,604
So perfect...

335
00:38:13,675 --> 00:38:15,800
that even he...

336
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:18,340
even he would say...

337
00:38:18,408 --> 00:38:22,897
- Who's he? Don Jarvis?
- Hmm?

338
00:38:22,974 --> 00:38:28,497
- Hmm.
- Oh, he'd say, "Sign on
the dotted line, kiddies.

339
00:38:28,574 --> 00:38:32,029
You can use my pen,
but bring your own ink."

340
00:38:32,108 --> 00:38:34,835
Well, if you're sure
it's worth it.

341
00:38:39,673 --> 00:38:41,662
It's time to find out,
Viv.

342
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,672
Do you mind
if I warm up?

343
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,638
Go ahead.

344
00:39:35,902 --> 00:39:37,993
You belong there.

345
00:39:51,268 --> 00:39:53,200
Oh, I do feel alone
in front of it.

346
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:56,859
- I suppose stars never do.
- They feel alone without it.

347
00:39:56,935 --> 00:40:00,731
And the great ones...
feel alone all the time.

348
00:40:00,801 --> 00:40:03,824
Then I'm great, boy.

349
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,890
What is it you want me to act?
Being frightened to death?

350
00:40:06,968 --> 00:40:08,990
You remembered?

351
00:40:09,067 --> 00:40:11,659
Yes, and I have a go.

352
00:40:13,134 --> 00:40:15,691
- What are you doing?
- Building us a set.

353
00:40:17,266 --> 00:40:19,528
Well, why don't you pull down
the studio while you're about it?

354
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,566
They can only
hang you once.

355
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:25,394
Exactly.

356
00:41:13,764 --> 00:41:17,627
If only Don Jarvis
could see me now.

357
00:41:17,695 --> 00:41:21,752
If only I could see
Don Jarvis now.

358
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:24,295
I warn you, Mark. I'm hysterical.

359
00:41:24,363 --> 00:41:27,920
I'd rather act dying of laughter
if it's all the same with you.

360
00:41:31,795 --> 00:41:37,193
I'll be a little lovelier each day
with fabulous pink.

361
00:41:53,195 --> 00:41:57,149
- What are you doing?
- Be patient, Viv.

362
00:41:57,227 --> 00:41:59,159
It's going to be
worth it.

363
00:42:01,526 --> 00:42:05,254
Oh, well. I've stood alone
in front of a studio camera.

364
00:42:05,327 --> 00:42:07,792
That's more than most have.

365
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,917
Ever stood behind one?

366
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:13,824
- No.
- Help yourself.

367
00:42:20,692 --> 00:42:25,284
- Oh, I can see you, Mark. Perfectly.
- Good.

368
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,883
Yes, sir. I bet I'm the best
camerawoman in the business.

369
00:42:32,459 --> 00:42:34,391
Now what are you doing?

370
00:42:34,459 --> 00:42:38,221
Photographing you
photographing me.

371
00:42:38,292 --> 00:42:41,849
Oh, Mark,
you're brilliant.

372
00:42:43,758 --> 00:42:45,690
Oh, I've lost you.

373
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:52,790
Ah, welcome, stranger.

374
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:57,687
- I've lost you again.
- Never mind.

375
00:42:57,756 --> 00:43:00,449
I'm ready now, Viv.

376
00:43:03,689 --> 00:43:07,678
Will you... go and stand
on your cross, please?

377
00:43:07,756 --> 00:43:11,449
Yes, sir,
Mr. Director, sir.

378
00:43:21,288 --> 00:43:24,880
Am I supposed to imagine
someone's gonna put me in there?

379
00:43:24,955 --> 00:43:28,182
- Yes, Viv.
- Oh, Mark, I...

380
00:43:28,254 --> 00:43:30,345
I hope I won't
let you down.

381
00:43:30,421 --> 00:43:33,785
I know you're trying to create
atmosphere for me, but...

382
00:43:33,855 --> 00:43:36,285
well, I just don't feel
frightened, that's all.

383
00:43:36,354 --> 00:43:38,513
Oh, wouldn't it be better
if I just did my number?

384
00:43:39,754 --> 00:43:42,049
Later.

385
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,484
The trouble is I feel so relaxed.
That's due to you.

386
00:43:45,554 --> 00:43:48,748
You're so at home with that camera,
you make me feel at home too.

387
00:43:48,821 --> 00:43:51,013
You have it in you, boy.

388
00:43:53,454 --> 00:43:56,385
Ready, Viv?

389
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:01,381
Oh, well, I'll try.

390
00:44:09,353 --> 00:44:12,148
What would frighten
me to death?

391
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:17,878
Oh, set the mood
for me, Mark.

392
00:44:19,918 --> 00:44:21,850
Imagine...

393
00:44:24,418 --> 00:44:28,510
someone coming
towards you...

394
00:44:30,452 --> 00:44:33,646
who wants to kill you...

395
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:38,308
regardless of
the consequences.

396
00:44:38,383 --> 00:44:41,247
- A madman?
- Yes.

397
00:44:41,316 --> 00:44:45,771
But he knows it,
and you don't.

398
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:51,407
And just to kill you
isn't enough for him.

399
00:44:53,949 --> 00:44:56,880
- But how does that...
- Stay there, Viv.

400
00:44:56,948 --> 00:44:59,141
You're just right.

401
00:45:03,082 --> 00:45:05,548
But I can't imagine
what you've thought of.

402
00:45:05,615 --> 00:45:09,342
Imagine... this...

403
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:12,245
would be one
of his weapons.

404
00:45:12,315 --> 00:45:15,178
That?

405
00:45:15,247 --> 00:45:18,077
Yes.

406
00:45:18,147 --> 00:45:22,704
- That.
- Mark.

407
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:25,871
Yes, that
would be frightening.

408
00:45:25,947 --> 00:45:27,879
There's something else.

409
00:45:30,381 --> 00:45:33,347
Well, what is it?

410
00:45:41,046 --> 00:45:43,012
That?

411
00:45:46,913 --> 00:45:48,845
Mark.

412
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,439
Mark, no.

413
00:45:53,512 --> 00:45:55,443
Take it away.

414
00:45:55,511 --> 00:45:59,137
Take it away.

415
00:45:59,212 --> 00:46:01,643
Mark!

416
00:46:01,712 --> 00:46:04,610
Mark!

417
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:07,236
And that, darling,
is the end of the news.

418
00:46:07,312 --> 00:46:10,937
- Oh, unless you want
the football results.
- Hm.

419
00:46:17,444 --> 00:46:20,500
- What are you looking at?
- The ceiling.

420
00:46:20,576 --> 00:46:24,508
- Wondering if that young man is home?
- Yes.

421
00:46:24,576 --> 00:46:28,508
Well, he is.
I heard him come in four paragraphs ago.

422
00:46:30,609 --> 00:46:34,335
He's late tonight.

423
00:46:34,408 --> 00:46:36,340
- Do you like him?
- Yes.

424
00:46:36,408 --> 00:46:39,034
- Why?
- Well, he has a quality.

425
00:46:39,109 --> 00:46:41,041
I wish this had.

426
00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:43,870
And I think he could
help me with my book.

427
00:46:47,342 --> 00:46:50,934
- Helen?
- Yes?

428
00:46:51,009 --> 00:46:54,565
- Doesn't matter.
- Mother, what's worrying you?

429
00:46:54,641 --> 00:46:57,607
- The price of whiskey.
- What else?

430
00:46:57,674 --> 00:47:00,868
- What else matters?
- Don't you like Mark?

431
00:47:00,941 --> 00:47:03,202
Haven't met him.

432
00:47:03,274 --> 00:47:06,263
You don't like him.
Why not?

433
00:47:06,341 --> 00:47:10,001
I don't trust a man
who walks quietly.

434
00:47:10,075 --> 00:47:12,734
Well, he's shy.

435
00:47:12,808 --> 00:47:17,102
- His footsteps aren't. They're stealthy.
- Now, really, Mother.

436
00:47:20,707 --> 00:47:23,502
- You going up to see him?
- May I?

437
00:47:25,506 --> 00:47:29,438
We both have the key of the door.
Mine needs oiling.

438
00:47:29,506 --> 00:47:34,597
- Yours needs exercise. Off you go.
- Thank you.

439
00:47:36,472 --> 00:47:40,165
- Remember you lost the draw.
- Mm-hmm.

440
00:47:40,238 --> 00:47:42,932
- Helen?
- Yes?

441
00:47:43,005 --> 00:47:48,404
If you're back in five minutes,
I won't even finish this.

442
00:47:48,472 --> 00:47:50,461
Done.

443
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:06,793
Who is it?

444
00:48:06,869 --> 00:48:09,892
- It's Helen.
- Oh.

445
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,698
Come in, Helen.

446
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:15,701
Would you just
wait in there?

447
00:48:15,769 --> 00:48:17,701
Developing.

448
00:48:22,802 --> 00:48:26,326
Mother heard you come in,
so I guessed you wouldn't be in bed.

449
00:48:28,868 --> 00:48:31,857
Are you sure
this is convenient?

450
00:48:31,935 --> 00:48:34,628
Won't be long!

451
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:59,690
I wish to express
my gratitude to the following people...

452
00:48:59,766 --> 00:49:02,164
for their
valuable contributions:

453
00:49:02,233 --> 00:49:05,199
Professor A.D. Smith
of New York University,

454
00:49:05,267 --> 00:49:10,427
Mr. Edward Paton of the Belgravia
Institute of Nervous Diseases...

455
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,987
and Mark Lewis,
my son.

456
00:49:15,099 --> 00:49:17,327
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Mark.

457
00:49:17,399 --> 00:49:20,456
I-I hope
you don't mind.

458
00:49:26,232 --> 00:49:31,164
I'm sure I'm being a nuisance,
but, Mark, I very much want to...

459
00:49:33,231 --> 00:49:38,186
- Happy birthday.
- Mark, that's very sweet
of you, but really.

460
00:49:38,265 --> 00:49:42,219
It isn't much.
I-I don't know anything about...

461
00:49:42,297 --> 00:49:44,728
21st birthday presents,

462
00:49:44,797 --> 00:49:46,820
but I saw it
this morning, so...

463
00:49:46,897 --> 00:49:49,193
- please.
- Mark.

464
00:49:49,264 --> 00:49:51,388
Thank you.

465
00:49:51,463 --> 00:49:53,894
Oh, it's beautiful.

466
00:49:53,963 --> 00:49:56,554
I liked it.

467
00:49:56,629 --> 00:49:58,595
- More milk?
- More?

468
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,890
- Milk?
- Oh, no thank you.

469
00:50:00,963 --> 00:50:03,793
I'm gonna put
it on now.

470
00:50:03,862 --> 00:50:06,987
There or... or there?

471
00:50:07,063 --> 00:50:12,257
- Uh... first place.
- Yes, I think so too.

472
00:50:20,728 --> 00:50:25,660
- Oh, I am keeping you.
- Oh. Oh, no.

473
00:50:25,728 --> 00:50:28,694
I... I promise.

474
00:50:28,761 --> 00:50:31,921
Mark, I'm here
for some advice.

475
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:36,483
- F-From me?
- Please.

476
00:50:38,094 --> 00:50:41,992
You see, I work in a public library
in the children's section.

477
00:50:42,061 --> 00:50:45,959
I'm telling you that to postpone
admitting what always embarrasses me.

478
00:50:46,027 --> 00:50:49,050
- In my spare time, I write.
- What's embarr...

479
00:50:49,126 --> 00:50:53,717
I write short stories for
children, but so did Grimm,
Hans Anderson and Lewis Carroll.

480
00:50:53,793 --> 00:50:56,588
- Had any published?
I'd like to read them.
- Some short stories.

481
00:50:56,659 --> 00:51:00,785
I learned today that
my first book has been accepted
for publication in the spring.

482
00:51:00,859 --> 00:51:05,291
- But... But Helen, th-that's wonderful.
- Yes.

483
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:08,587
- What is it about?
- A magic camera and what it photographs.

484
00:51:10,993 --> 00:51:15,219
What... Whatever made
you think of that?

485
00:51:15,291 --> 00:51:18,655
I'll tell you one day.
I promise.

486
00:51:21,558 --> 00:51:25,853
- W-What does it photograph?
- I'll tell you that too,
but Mark, this is the problem.

487
00:51:25,924 --> 00:51:29,412
The children who read the book will want
to see the pictures the camera takes,

488
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:32,887
but the publishers say they're
impossible to photograph,
and they suggest drawings.

489
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:36,821
- But you see, I don't agree.
- Oh, no. Nothing's impossible.

490
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:38,822
Oh, I was hoping
you'd say that.

491
00:51:38,889 --> 00:51:41,185
There must be photographs,
however difficult to take,

492
00:51:41,525 --> 00:51:43,457
- And Mark, I was wondering if...
- Oh, yes.

493
00:51:43,525 --> 00:51:45,457
- You'll discuss it with me?
- Take them.

494
00:51:45,525 --> 00:51:47,457
Well, I can't ask you
to do that.

495
00:51:47,525 --> 00:51:50,082
I mean, the publishers
mightn't agree.

496
00:51:50,158 --> 00:51:52,918
- I'd like to take them for you.
- But the money.

497
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:56,854
There are some things
which I...

498
00:51:56,923 --> 00:52:02,322
- photograph for nothing.
- I didn't mean to offend you.

499
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:05,220
- Offend?
- Then you'll talk it over with me?

500
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:07,256
- When, please?
- That's up to you.

501
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:09,256
- Are you free tomorrow night?
- Yes.

502
00:52:09,324 --> 00:52:12,483
- I hope I am.
- Well, I'll understand if you're not.

503
00:52:12,556 --> 00:52:16,386
I'll try.
I'll try my hardest to be.

504
00:52:16,456 --> 00:52:19,684
Thank you for listening...

505
00:52:19,755 --> 00:52:23,188
and for my present.

506
00:52:26,389 --> 00:52:29,752
- Good night.
- Good night.

507
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:58,179
- Looking for a trunk?
- Uh, yes. I'd like to see that one.

508
00:52:58,254 --> 00:53:00,186
Certainly, Madam.

509
00:53:03,819 --> 00:53:09,479
No. No, no,
no, no, no, no.

510
00:53:09,552 --> 00:53:12,608
We must have some comedy
in this scene.

511
00:53:12,685 --> 00:53:16,674
- We'll retake it today.
- Very good, sir.

512
00:53:16,751 --> 00:53:19,478
The thing about this scene is
I must have some comedy in it.

513
00:53:19,551 --> 00:53:21,915
Now you do understand, darling,
don't you? You see,

514
00:53:21,985 --> 00:53:25,815
that instead of taking the first trunk,
I want you to ask to see a red one.

515
00:53:25,885 --> 00:53:27,851
And when he brings that,
I want you to look around...

516
00:53:27,918 --> 00:53:30,043
- and ask... excuse me a second, darling...
- Sorry.

517
00:53:30,118 --> 00:53:33,378
For a white one,
then when he brings the white one,

518
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:38,849
then you ask for a different one...
this one, the blue one.

519
00:53:38,917 --> 00:53:41,542
And you, Michael, bring the trunks one
by one, getting more and more fed up.

520
00:53:41,617 --> 00:53:43,549
- I'll keep it light.
- I'm sure you will.

521
00:53:43,617 --> 00:53:46,243
Then we'll end up on some sort of
a gag I'll think of in a minute.

522
00:53:46,317 --> 00:53:50,114
- Understand? What?
- I don't feel it.

523
00:53:50,184 --> 00:53:54,308
- Don't feel it.
- Don't feel it, just do it!

524
00:53:54,382 --> 00:53:57,348
- All right. Positions, everybody.
- Anyone seen Viv?

525
00:53:57,416 --> 00:54:00,746
- Who?
- Oh, Diane's stand-in.
I want to light the set.

526
00:54:00,816 --> 00:54:03,782
No, Phil. I want to run it first.
- All right, quiet.

527
00:54:03,849 --> 00:54:05,815
All right. Ready? Action.

528
00:54:05,883 --> 00:54:08,849
- Here we are, Madam.
Oh, I'd like to see one in red.

529
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:11,245
Certainly, Madam.

530
00:54:17,982 --> 00:54:20,141
Do you remember
doing it?

531
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:23,978
Right. Ready for you,
and back you go.

532
00:54:24,049 --> 00:54:27,708
- Play for a close-up there.
- Um, do you have one in white?

533
00:54:27,782 --> 00:54:30,771
Certainly, Madam.

534
00:54:30,848 --> 00:54:33,108
There's a white one there behind you.

535
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:35,578
Right here. Again.

536
00:54:38,048 --> 00:54:41,343
Good, Michael.
Excellent.

537
00:54:41,414 --> 00:54:43,903
All right.
Back again.

538
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:48,571
- Oh, um, do you have one in blue?
- Certainly, Madam.

539
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:53,210
That's it, and back you go.

540
00:54:55,478 --> 00:55:00,342
That's it. Just take what you can
without overdoing it.

541
00:55:03,512 --> 00:55:06,273
Play it lightly, Michael.

542
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:10,277
Right. When it's in position,
keep it tight, enter him there.

543
00:55:10,345 --> 00:55:12,333
Very good.

544
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:23,536
The silly bitch.
She's fainted in the wrong scene.

545
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:32,669
- Excuse me, Chief?
- Mmm?

546
00:55:32,743 --> 00:55:34,732
Um, we pass my place
at the end of the bypass.

547
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:36,934
Do you mind if I
drop in for a moment?

548
00:55:37,009 --> 00:55:39,873
- To collect your kid's autograph book?
- That's it, Chief.

549
00:55:39,943 --> 00:55:42,273
- If the nipper finds out
where I've been...
- All right, Dawson.

550
00:55:42,343 --> 00:55:44,468
Anything to help
the sergeant.

551
00:55:44,543 --> 00:55:48,872
It's about time the sergeant
helped me. We're not getting
anywhere with this Soho murder.

552
00:55:48,943 --> 00:55:52,136
Well, what about that chap
the landlady passed on the stairs?

553
00:55:52,209 --> 00:55:55,141
She couldn't describe him except
to say that he was carrying
something she couldn't see.

554
00:55:55,209 --> 00:55:59,642
- Oh, that's a help.
- Sergeant, I've been
on the force 30 years,

555
00:55:59,709 --> 00:56:04,539
and I've never seen such fear
on anyone's face as on this girl's.

556
00:56:04,609 --> 00:56:10,405
- What was it she saw?
- Well, surely, a man coming
at her with a sharp weapon.

557
00:56:10,475 --> 00:56:13,099
Mmm. I'm familiar with
that kind of terror.

558
00:56:13,174 --> 00:56:16,731
This is something new to me.
But what?

559
00:56:19,508 --> 00:56:22,440
That's the one, sir.

560
00:56:35,105 --> 00:56:37,900
- Chief, the expression. It's exactly...
- I know.

561
00:56:37,972 --> 00:56:39,995
Don't say anything.

562
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:52,235
Well, sir, we shall probably
have to interview everyone,

563
00:56:52,305 --> 00:56:55,793
so we better plan a campaign
that won't interfere too much
with your productions.

564
00:56:55,871 --> 00:57:00,735
Oh, thank you, Chief Inspector.
If you knew what even
a single day's delay could cost.

565
00:57:00,804 --> 00:57:04,100
Oh, uh, we do, sir.

566
00:57:08,371 --> 00:57:10,859
- Hello, Mark.
- Hello.

567
00:57:14,403 --> 00:57:17,199
- Hey, I don't think
you ought to do that.
- Sorry, sir.

568
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:22,168
- Do what?
- Make me famous.
Some chap's giving me a screen test.

569
00:57:22,237 --> 00:57:26,067
Gerry, you're next. Don't look
so scared. They can't eat you.

570
00:57:26,137 --> 00:57:29,796
Looks as though it's going
to be an early night tonight.

571
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:32,994
- I've been watching you.
- Oh.

572
00:57:33,069 --> 00:57:36,398
- Have you been filming those policemen?
- Hmm.

573
00:57:36,468 --> 00:57:39,060
I have a few quite
interesting shots of them.

574
00:57:39,136 --> 00:57:43,500
- It's a chance I never expected.
- Chance for what?

575
00:57:43,569 --> 00:57:46,195
To photograph
an investigation...

576
00:57:46,268 --> 00:57:49,201
or as much of it
as I can get.

577
00:57:49,268 --> 00:57:51,200
What on Earth for?

578
00:57:51,267 --> 00:57:54,461
It will complete
a documentary.

579
00:57:54,534 --> 00:57:56,932
- Documentary, huh? What's it about?
- Mmm.

580
00:57:57,001 --> 00:57:59,193
- Hmm?
- What's it about?

581
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:02,166
I'd rather not tell you
till it's finished,

582
00:58:02,234 --> 00:58:04,166
and it will be soon.

583
00:58:04,234 --> 00:58:07,791
- Suppose they catch you?
- Oh, they will.
They look very efficient.

584
00:58:07,867 --> 00:58:10,492
- Don't you mind?
- No.

585
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:14,123
- Mark, are you crazy?
- Yes.

586
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,188
Do you think
they'll notice?

587
00:58:16,265 --> 00:58:20,254
- Mark, you're next.
- Don't get into trouble
for heaven's sake.

588
00:58:20,332 --> 00:58:23,321
I want to discuss
that film at the Everyman.

589
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:26,422
Oh, yes, I'd like that.

590
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:31,696
Come in!

591
00:58:34,264 --> 00:58:38,594
Mr. Lewis?
Ah, my photographer.

592
00:58:38,665 --> 00:58:43,290
I brought you the camera in case
you wanted to take the film away.

593
00:58:45,531 --> 00:58:48,463
- Chief?
- That's all right, Mr. Lewis.

594
00:58:48,531 --> 00:58:53,758
As long as we don't appear at the local
next week in place of the cartoon.

595
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:56,989
I'm Chief Inspector Gregg.
This is Sergeant Miller.

596
00:58:57,063 --> 00:58:59,359
Grab a chair.

597
00:59:01,063 --> 00:59:04,860
Well, now, have you
anything to tell us?

598
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:07,396
- I don't think so, sir.
- Did you know the girl?

599
00:59:07,463 --> 00:59:10,293
- Yes, sir.
- How well?

600
00:59:10,362 --> 00:59:14,294
- Mainly by sight.
- Mm-hmm.

601
00:59:14,362 --> 00:59:19,851
- When did you last see her?
- Yesterday afternoon before we broke.

602
00:59:19,929 --> 00:59:25,260
- Did you speak to her?
- I called out good night.

603
00:59:25,329 --> 00:59:28,159
Don't know if she heard me.

604
00:59:29,596 --> 00:59:34,584
- What'd you do then?
- Oh, taking some shots.

605
00:59:34,662 --> 00:59:37,628
I'm making a film.

606
00:59:37,695 --> 00:59:41,650
- Oh? Where?
- Oh, all over the place.

607
00:59:41,727 --> 00:59:43,660
It's a documentary.

608
00:59:43,727 --> 00:59:46,852
Mm-hmm.
Anyone with you?

609
00:59:46,928 --> 00:59:50,484
No, sir. Just my...
Just my camera.

610
00:59:55,526 --> 00:59:58,787
Sergeant Miller.

611
00:59:58,859 --> 01:00:01,348
Right.
I'll tell 'im.

612
01:00:01,426 --> 01:00:04,687
The doctor's finished
his examination,

613
01:00:04,759 --> 01:00:06,691
and he wants
to see you.

614
01:00:06,759 --> 01:00:10,384
- Right. You'd better go on first.
- Right, sir.

615
01:00:14,525 --> 01:00:17,218
Got ya.

616
01:00:17,292 --> 01:00:19,224
- Nice job.
- Thank you, sir.

617
01:00:25,991 --> 01:00:28,786
What time did you arrive home
last night, Mr. Lewis?

618
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:32,346
About 10:00, 10:30.

619
01:00:32,424 --> 01:00:36,322
- Anyone see you?
- Yes. The people who live downstairs.

620
01:00:36,391 --> 01:00:38,948
I see.

621
01:00:39,024 --> 01:00:42,717
Right. That's all.
Thank you, Mr. Lewis.

622
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:44,722
- Thank you, sir.
- Okay.

623
01:00:46,224 --> 01:00:48,156
Wait a minute!

624
01:00:50,589 --> 01:00:52,817
Direct me to that set of yours,
would you?

625
01:00:52,889 --> 01:00:55,787
I'd probably end up
on location.

626
01:00:55,856 --> 01:00:58,254
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

627
01:01:06,722 --> 01:01:08,654
I warned 'im.

628
01:01:14,821 --> 01:01:17,912
Well, I think I can find my way now.
Thanks for the escort.

629
01:02:10,517 --> 01:02:13,711
- No doubt at all.
Wounds caused by the same instrument.
- Mm-hmm.

630
01:02:13,784 --> 01:02:16,443
Both women subjected
to the most violent shock.

631
01:02:16,517 --> 01:02:20,279
- What sort of shock?
- Up to you to find out, Inspector.

632
01:02:20,350 --> 01:02:22,839
Not my department.

633
01:02:22,918 --> 01:02:26,406
- Can we move the body?
- Yes. I-I have finished.

634
01:02:26,484 --> 01:02:28,416
That's all fellows.

635
01:02:40,949 --> 01:02:43,575
Hello.
What's this she's lying on?

636
01:02:44,982 --> 01:02:47,778
- Oh, a tape recorder.
- Give me a handkerchief.

637
01:03:01,248 --> 01:03:03,180
Baxter!

638
01:03:08,282 --> 01:03:11,145
Get it tested for fingerprints.

639
01:03:11,213 --> 01:03:14,008
- Get all the reels played back.
- Right.

640
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,745
Quiet, everyone.
Quiet!

641
01:03:25,746 --> 01:03:28,212
I taught I heard a putty tat.

642
01:03:29,811 --> 01:03:32,777
I don't want to spoil
anyone's fun,

643
01:03:32,845 --> 01:03:34,902
but we do have
a maniac on our hands.

644
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:37,035
And if we don't
get 'im quickly,

645
01:03:37,112 --> 01:03:40,408
there'll be a third unsolved murder
to report to the commissioner.

646
01:03:40,479 --> 01:03:42,671
So let's hurry things up.
Shall we?

647
01:04:03,344 --> 01:04:05,639
"She was appearing
in Arthur Baden's new film...

648
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:08,835
The Walls Are Closing In,
starring Pauline Shields.

649
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:12,774
A spokesman at the studio said
that her performance in the film
showed such promise...

650
01:04:12,843 --> 01:04:15,832
that her role was
to have been built up."

651
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:19,001
- Oh, the prime minister...
- Mark is in films, isn't he?

652
01:04:19,076 --> 01:04:23,008
- Yes, darling. "Sir Lav..."
- I wonder if he knew her.

653
01:04:23,076 --> 01:04:27,133
- I'll ask him tonight.
- Oh. Is he taking you out?

654
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:31,141
- Yes, if he's free.
- Hmm. That's very chivalrous of 'im.

655
01:04:31,209 --> 01:04:35,335
- Where is he taking you?
- I have no idea,
and I don't suppose he has.

656
01:04:36,408 --> 01:04:38,567
Which studio
does he work at?

657
01:04:38,642 --> 01:04:42,699
- I don't know. I'll ask him.
- If he's free.

658
01:04:42,775 --> 01:04:45,536
Shall I bring him in
and introduce you?

659
01:04:45,608 --> 01:04:49,199
- I feel as if I know him.
- Now, darling.

660
01:04:49,275 --> 01:04:51,207
He's here.

661
01:04:54,073 --> 01:04:56,903
Why don't we make him
a present of that window?

662
01:04:56,973 --> 01:04:59,370
He practically lives there.

663
01:04:59,439 --> 01:05:01,371
How did you know
he was there?

664
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,701
The back of my neck told me.

665
01:05:07,306 --> 01:05:09,828
The part that
I talk out of.

666
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,997
Hello.

667
01:05:12,072 --> 01:05:15,095
- Free? Good. So am I.
- Yes.

668
01:05:15,173 --> 01:05:18,332
I'd like you to come in
for a moment and meet my mother.

669
01:05:21,639 --> 01:05:23,571
Yes, please.

670
01:05:26,472 --> 01:05:29,097
Darling, this is Mark.

671
01:05:32,071 --> 01:05:34,128
H-How do you do,
Mrs. Stephens?

672
01:05:34,204 --> 01:05:36,136
Hello, Mark.

673
01:05:36,204 --> 01:05:39,534
Have you been running, young man?

674
01:05:39,604 --> 01:05:43,229
Yes. Didn't want
to be late for Helen.

675
01:05:43,304 --> 01:05:45,566
Thank you.
You deserve a drink for that.

676
01:05:45,638 --> 01:05:49,433
- What would you like?
- Uh, nothing. Thank you very much.

677
01:05:49,503 --> 01:05:52,128
- Hmm. Tell me, young man,
- Mother, I've left your supper...

678
01:05:52,203 --> 01:05:54,829
which studio
do you work at?

679
01:05:54,904 --> 01:05:57,734
Chipperfield Studio.

680
01:05:57,803 --> 01:06:00,325
That poor girl,
where did she work?

681
01:06:00,403 --> 01:06:04,358
- Brookwood, I think.
- Hmm.

682
01:06:04,436 --> 01:06:06,459
We were wondering
if you knew her.

683
01:06:06,537 --> 01:06:08,832
No.

684
01:06:08,903 --> 01:06:11,266
No.
I didn't know her.

685
01:06:11,335 --> 01:06:14,994
Pity.
I do like firsthand information.

686
01:06:15,068 --> 01:06:17,466
Darling, may I tell you
about your supper?

687
01:06:17,536 --> 01:06:21,525
No.
Go and be told about yours.

688
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:25,125
Good-bye, Mark.
I expect we shall meet again.

689
01:06:25,202 --> 01:06:27,134
I hope so,
Mrs. Stephens.

690
01:06:31,334 --> 01:06:34,060
Mother, we forgot to cut the cards.

691
01:06:34,133 --> 01:06:36,292
Your supper's
laid out in the kitchen.

692
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:39,026
If you're not back early,
you'll find me laid out with it.

693
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:42,624
- We'll be early. Bye, darling.
- Night.

694
01:06:53,932 --> 01:06:57,228
- Mark, I want to ask you
something rather personal.
- Yes?

695
01:06:57,299 --> 01:07:00,732
- How long is it since you've
gone out without that?
- Without what?

696
01:07:00,798 --> 01:07:02,821
That camera.

697
01:07:02,899 --> 01:07:06,763
Oh. I... I don't
think I know.

698
01:07:06,832 --> 01:07:10,229
Exactly. I don't think
I've ever seen you without it.

699
01:07:10,298 --> 01:07:12,662
But are you going
to need it tonight?

700
01:07:14,265 --> 01:07:16,629
Well, are you?

701
01:07:16,697 --> 01:07:19,459
And if so, shall I bring
some work with me too?

702
01:07:20,998 --> 01:07:23,930
- I'm not going to need it tonight.
- Good, then give it to me.

703
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:27,396
- Well, I'll put it away for you.
It'll be quite safe.
- No.

704
01:07:27,465 --> 01:07:30,225
Then take it upstairs
if you can't trust me with it.

705
01:07:34,264 --> 01:07:36,389
I trust you.

706
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:42,262
Then let's put it
in here.

707
01:07:43,997 --> 01:07:47,861
Come in and see for yourself.
We'll put it in there and lock it.

708
01:07:58,263 --> 01:08:01,888
This was my...
my mother's room.

709
01:08:01,962 --> 01:08:05,360
- Was it, Mark?
- Hmm.

710
01:08:07,096 --> 01:08:09,186
I am being tactless,
aren't I?

711
01:08:09,262 --> 01:08:13,489
It's just that I thought it was
growing into an extra limb, and I...

712
01:08:14,561 --> 01:08:16,958
But bring it with you,
if you want to.

713
01:08:17,027 --> 01:08:19,857
- You.
- Thank you.

714
01:08:31,893 --> 01:08:33,825
- I feel...
- Yes?

715
01:08:36,026 --> 01:08:39,458
I can't describe it.
Could only photograph it.

716
01:08:39,526 --> 01:08:41,890
- Shall I tell you what I feel?
Famished!
- Hmm. Good.

717
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:44,925
I know a small place
around the corner.

718
01:08:44,993 --> 01:08:46,925
- It's awfully good on Christmas Day.
- Is it?

719
01:08:46,993 --> 01:08:49,049
- Yes. There aren't too many open then.
- No.

720
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,057
Sounds fun.

721
01:08:55,558 --> 01:08:57,649
- Helen?
- Yes?

722
01:08:58,858 --> 01:09:01,323
Come on.
This way.

723
01:09:03,758 --> 01:09:05,917
- What does your
magic camera photograph?
- People.

724
01:09:05,992 --> 01:09:09,514
It's owned by a little boy,
and it sees grown-ups as they
were when they were children.

725
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:12,215
I was hoping you'd be able
to when you were...

726
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:24,856
Where is
this restaurant?

727
01:09:24,924 --> 01:09:27,185
- Around the corner.
- Come along then.

728
01:09:28,256 --> 01:09:30,188
Thank you.

729
01:10:12,853 --> 01:10:15,717
There isn't a single face in the crowd
that doesn't look like a child.

730
01:10:15,786 --> 01:10:19,377
- Don't say that.
- If you catch it at the right moment.

731
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:30,341
Oh, Helen. I would like
to find those faces for you, with you.

732
01:10:30,418 --> 01:10:32,350
Well, let's try.

733
01:10:36,652 --> 01:10:39,947
Oh. Mother must have
gone to bed.

734
01:10:41,685 --> 01:10:45,082
- Oh, Mark... it was a wonderful evening.
- Eh...

735
01:10:47,118 --> 01:10:49,208
That's what I was
going to say.

736
01:10:49,284 --> 01:10:51,216
It was a wonderful evening.

737
01:10:51,284 --> 01:10:53,715
And you made it wonderful...

738
01:10:53,783 --> 01:10:57,409
without your camera.

739
01:10:57,484 --> 01:10:59,450
I'll get it for you.

740
01:11:05,518 --> 01:11:07,846
It's still here,

741
01:11:07,916 --> 01:11:09,848
you're magic camera.

742
01:11:09,916 --> 01:11:13,076
I wonder how
this sees grown-ups.

743
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:15,309
- Me, for instance. Now that I am one.
- Not you.

744
01:11:15,383 --> 01:11:17,315
Why not?

745
01:11:17,383 --> 01:11:20,440
- It will never see you.
- Mark.

746
01:11:21,983 --> 01:11:24,245
Whatever I photograph,

747
01:11:24,316 --> 01:11:26,248
I always lose.

748
01:11:26,316 --> 01:11:28,406
I don't understand.

749
01:11:43,714 --> 01:11:46,908
Oh, he'll wake Mother.

750
01:11:49,447 --> 01:11:53,379
Thank you again
for my evening.

751
01:11:53,446 --> 01:11:57,311
Will you go to bed now,
and not stop up watching those films?

752
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:00,411
Well, I...

753
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:02,445
I've got some
work to do.

754
01:12:03,779 --> 01:12:05,904
Then I'll
go to bed,

755
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:07,911
and try to find
your faces.

756
01:12:09,112 --> 01:12:11,044
Faces which I...

757
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:15,310
Faces which...

758
01:13:13,809 --> 01:13:16,434
- Good evening, Mark.
- How did you...

759
01:13:16,509 --> 01:13:21,497
The young man bathing himself
brought me to your door.

760
01:13:21,574 --> 01:13:24,802
I managed the rest
of the adventure alone.

761
01:13:26,274 --> 01:13:30,899
This is one room
I expected to find locked.

762
01:13:30,974 --> 01:13:33,405
I was never
allowed keys.

763
01:13:33,473 --> 01:13:35,439
Can't get used
to them.

764
01:13:35,507 --> 01:13:38,530
I brought her home early.

765
01:13:38,607 --> 01:13:40,539
Thank you.

766
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:45,005
- Is there something you...
- A talk.

767
01:13:45,073 --> 01:13:48,903
- Next door would be more...
- I...

768
01:13:48,972 --> 01:13:51,461
I feel at home here.

769
01:13:54,305 --> 01:13:57,829
I-I visit this room
every night.

770
01:13:57,905 --> 01:13:59,838
Visit?

771
01:14:08,204 --> 01:14:13,000
The blind always live
in the rooms they live under.

772
01:14:27,936 --> 01:14:31,596
Every night you switch on
that film machine.

773
01:14:33,370 --> 01:14:37,462
What are these films
you can't wait to look at?

774
01:14:38,769 --> 01:14:40,735
What's the film
you're showing now?

775
01:14:43,137 --> 01:14:45,433
Why don't you
lie to me?

776
01:14:45,504 --> 01:14:48,492
- I'd never know.
- You would know at once.

777
01:14:48,569 --> 01:14:52,728
- Take me to your cinema.
- Yes.

778
01:15:02,868 --> 01:15:04,891
What am I seeing, Mark?

779
01:15:09,467 --> 01:15:11,399
Why don't you answer?

780
01:15:16,867 --> 01:15:20,594
Oh!

781
01:15:20,666 --> 01:15:22,655
It's no good.

782
01:15:22,733 --> 01:15:25,427
I was afraid
it wouldn't be.

783
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:29,125
- What?
- The lights fade too soon.

784
01:15:31,333 --> 01:15:35,163
- They always do.
- I...

785
01:15:35,233 --> 01:15:38,528
I have to try again.

786
01:15:42,532 --> 01:15:44,998
What do you think
you've spoiled?

787
01:15:45,066 --> 01:15:47,361
Opportunity.

788
01:15:47,431 --> 01:15:50,454
Now I have to find
another one.

789
01:15:57,965 --> 01:16:00,522
What are you doing?

790
01:16:00,598 --> 01:16:02,530
Mark?

791
01:16:04,464 --> 01:16:06,929
Where are you?

792
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:09,996
Where are you?

793
01:16:12,064 --> 01:16:14,189
Why are you putting
that light on my face?

794
01:16:17,197 --> 01:16:19,129
Mark?

795
01:16:24,396 --> 01:16:28,123
Please let me finish.

796
01:16:28,196 --> 01:16:30,128
It's for Helen.

797
01:16:31,229 --> 01:16:35,094
What do you mean,
"It's for Helen"?

798
01:16:35,163 --> 01:16:38,027
She wanted to see
something I photographed.

799
01:16:38,096 --> 01:16:40,527
My daughter sees enough
of my face without photographs.

800
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:45,051
Please, don't-
don't be frightened.

801
01:16:46,127 --> 01:16:49,094
Not frightened.
Hot.

802
01:16:50,627 --> 01:16:53,025
So put that
camera away!

803
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:09,892
Yes.

804
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:25,450
In rather a hurry,
aren't you?

805
01:17:25,525 --> 01:17:28,047
Must be tired.

806
01:17:29,125 --> 01:17:31,318
It's late.
You...

807
01:17:31,391 --> 01:17:35,187
You're anxious to get rid
of me all of a sudden.

808
01:17:38,658 --> 01:17:41,249
I-I won't be selfish.

809
01:17:41,325 --> 01:17:44,018
You-You can take some more pictures,
if you want to.

810
01:17:44,091 --> 01:17:46,022
No, thank you.

811
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:48,318
Why not?

812
01:17:49,390 --> 01:17:51,515
I ran out of film.

813
01:17:51,591 --> 01:17:54,988
Can't you find some more
to please Helen?

814
01:17:55,057 --> 01:17:57,615
No. No.

815
01:17:58,857 --> 01:18:01,187
You... You don't
trust yourself...

816
01:18:01,257 --> 01:18:03,189
to take any more,
do you?

817
01:18:05,356 --> 01:18:08,117
Instinct's a wonderful thing,
isn't it, Mark?

818
01:18:09,856 --> 01:18:12,845
A pity it
can't be photographed.

819
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:18,354
If I'd listened to it
years ago, I...

820
01:18:18,423 --> 01:18:20,980
I might have
kept my sight.

821
01:18:22,754 --> 01:18:26,379
I wouldn't have let a man
operate I had no faith in.

822
01:18:26,454 --> 01:18:29,851
So, I'm listening
to my instinct now.

823
01:18:35,154 --> 01:18:40,314
And it says all this
filming isn't healthy,

824
01:18:40,387 --> 01:18:43,046
and that
you need help.

825
01:18:43,121 --> 01:18:45,279
Get it, Mark.

826
01:18:45,353 --> 01:18:47,750
Get it quickly.

827
01:18:47,819 --> 01:18:51,547
And until you do, I don't want you
and Helen to see each other.

828
01:18:51,619 --> 01:18:53,552
I will never photograph her,
I promise you.

829
01:18:53,619 --> 01:18:57,608
I'd rather you don't have the chance.
I mean it, Mark.

830
01:18:59,487 --> 01:19:02,317
And if you don't
listen to me,

831
01:19:02,386 --> 01:19:05,146
one of us will move
from this house.

832
01:19:05,219 --> 01:19:08,946
It would be a pity, because we'll
never find a cheaper place.

833
01:19:09,018 --> 01:19:13,473
You'll never have to move because of me.
I... I promise.

834
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:27,180
Good boy.

835
01:19:32,084 --> 01:19:35,379
The stairs are
the difficult part.

836
01:19:51,050 --> 01:19:53,538
That's far enough.
Thank you.

837
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:12,780
Taking my picture?

838
01:20:14,181 --> 01:20:16,442
Yes.

839
01:20:16,514 --> 01:20:19,275
It's a long time
since anyone did.

840
01:20:21,347 --> 01:20:25,210
Mark, what's
troubling you?

841
01:20:27,279 --> 01:20:30,075
Good night,
Mrs. Stephens.

842
01:20:30,146 --> 01:20:32,544
You'll have
to tell someone.

843
01:20:37,013 --> 01:20:39,501
You'll have to!

844
01:21:06,778 --> 01:21:09,801
Now over here.
Swing over on me. Good.

845
01:21:09,878 --> 01:21:12,639
All right. Here we go. First positions,
everybody. Absolute quiet.

846
01:21:12,711 --> 01:21:16,336
- Ready to turn, Phil?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah. Okay.

847
01:21:19,077 --> 01:21:21,941
Hey! That sneezer geezer's
a psychiatrist.

848
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:24,374
Heard it
on the grapevine.

849
01:21:24,443 --> 01:21:27,341
All right, boys and girls.
First positions, everybody.

850
01:21:27,410 --> 01:21:31,172
Now, take it easy, and I know you'll be
absolutely wonderful, darling.

851
01:21:31,243 --> 01:21:33,505
- It's simply just...
Do you mind standing...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

852
01:21:33,577 --> 01:21:35,509
- Who is this, Alex?
- It's the detective, sir.

853
01:21:35,577 --> 01:21:39,737
Oh-Oh, yes. Of course it is. Everybody's
here just to help you, darling.

854
01:21:39,810 --> 01:21:43,401
Now, take it easy.
It's exactly the same as it was before,

855
01:21:43,477 --> 01:21:45,464
only one or two
slight changes.

856
01:21:45,541 --> 01:21:47,972
This time it's hats
instead of...

857
01:21:50,041 --> 01:21:52,166
Of, um, of trunks.

858
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:55,173
- You will help, Michael, won't you?
You know.
- Yes, sir.

859
01:21:55,241 --> 01:21:59,935
Now, darling, be very brave. You're
wonderful, and we shall all be with you.

860
01:22:00,007 --> 01:22:04,234
- Just as... Oh, please!
- All right. Clear the set!
Please, makeup.

861
01:22:04,307 --> 01:22:06,966
- Now, take it easy, darling. Just relax.
- All right.

862
01:22:08,407 --> 01:22:11,532
All right.
And camera!

863
01:22:11,607 --> 01:22:13,799
Hat, madam?

864
01:22:13,873 --> 01:22:15,998
Yes. I-I'd like
to see that one.

865
01:22:16,073 --> 01:22:18,005
Certainly, madam.

866
01:22:22,373 --> 01:22:24,304
Thank you.

867
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:26,304
Oh.

868
01:22:26,372 --> 01:22:28,997
Uh, have you
one in red?

869
01:22:29,072 --> 01:22:31,004
Certainly, madam.

870
01:22:34,805 --> 01:22:38,499
In red? In red?
Have you one in blue?

871
01:22:38,572 --> 01:22:40,868
In blue. In blue.

872
01:22:42,206 --> 01:22:44,433
Ye gods!

873
01:22:45,904 --> 01:22:48,631
- Break for half an hour, sir?
- No. Break forever!

874
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:51,966
All right, boys and girls.
Break it up. Back in half an hour.

875
01:22:54,637 --> 01:22:57,694
Hmm?

876
01:22:59,105 --> 01:23:02,037
Yes.

877
01:23:02,105 --> 01:23:05,298
- Could you, uh, suggest something?
- Oh, it's jolly interesting.

878
01:23:05,370 --> 01:23:07,665
No. I mean to help her...
psychologically.

879
01:23:07,736 --> 01:23:11,066
Oh, uh, give her a proper rest.
Half an hour is useless.

880
01:23:11,137 --> 01:23:13,103
Yes.
Thanks very much.

881
01:23:16,370 --> 01:23:18,858
Psst!
What's your job?

882
01:23:18,937 --> 01:23:21,494
I'm... a focus puller.

883
01:23:21,570 --> 01:23:23,559
Oh. So am I,
in a way.

884
01:23:24,635 --> 01:23:27,361
- I wonder...
- Hmm?

885
01:23:33,268 --> 01:23:36,631
I wonder if you knew
my father, Professor Lewis?

886
01:23:36,701 --> 01:23:38,633
- A...
- A. N. Lewis.

887
01:23:38,701 --> 01:23:41,792
Oh, of course
I knew him.

888
01:23:41,868 --> 01:23:43,799
He lectured to me.
An extraordinary man.

889
01:23:43,867 --> 01:23:46,799
Brilliant!
Quite brilliant!

890
01:23:46,867 --> 01:23:50,560
Do you know what he was interested in...
before he died?

891
01:23:50,633 --> 01:23:52,565
No. Tell me.
Tell me.

892
01:23:56,067 --> 01:23:59,521
I-I don't remember
what he called it,

893
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:03,555
but it has something
to do with what...

894
01:24:03,633 --> 01:24:07,325
what causes people
to be Peeping Toms.

895
01:24:07,399 --> 01:24:11,889
Scoptophilia, that would interest him.
Most fertile mind.

896
01:24:11,966 --> 01:24:17,058
- Scopto...
- Philia. The morbid urge to gaze.

897
01:24:17,132 --> 01:24:20,587
Coined since his day. Now tell me,
are there any of his manuscripts left?

898
01:24:20,666 --> 01:24:22,757
- I thought it could be cured.
- Usually. Yeah.

899
01:24:22,833 --> 01:24:24,957
- Now about his manuscripts.
- Quickly.

900
01:24:25,032 --> 01:24:28,896
The cure. Oh, very quick. A couple
of years' analysis three times a week,

901
01:24:28,965 --> 01:24:32,124
an hour a time
and soon it's uprooted.

902
01:24:33,264 --> 01:24:35,389
Now, are there any
of his papers left?

903
01:24:35,465 --> 01:24:38,090
I should be most grateful
if I could see them.

904
01:24:38,164 --> 01:24:40,426
I-I'll give you
my address.

905
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:51,596
Yes, Doctor.

906
01:24:51,664 --> 01:24:55,619
- I wonder what all that's about?
- I don't know.

907
01:24:55,697 --> 01:24:57,629
We'll find out afterwards.

908
01:25:17,028 --> 01:25:18,960
Hey, Mark.

909
01:25:21,595 --> 01:25:23,719
Can't wait
to show you this.

910
01:25:23,794 --> 01:25:25,816
I should charge ya.

911
01:25:25,893 --> 01:25:28,758
You don't get that
in Sight and Sound.

912
01:25:28,827 --> 01:25:30,952
Oh, she's terrific.

913
01:25:32,027 --> 01:25:34,220
I got some more,
if you're interested.

914
01:25:35,294 --> 01:25:39,386
You've given me...
an idea.

915
01:25:39,461 --> 01:25:43,052
Hey, I'll bet
I have.

916
01:25:43,127 --> 01:25:45,592
He asked me if I knew his father,
which I did.

917
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:48,217
- Brilliant man.
- Is that all he wanted?

918
01:25:48,293 --> 01:25:51,952
I think so. Oh, we had
a little chat about scoptophilia.

919
01:25:52,026 --> 01:25:54,753
- And he's going to... Voyeurism.
- About what?

920
01:25:54,826 --> 01:25:58,190
- Eh?
- What makes people into Peeping Toms,

921
01:25:58,259 --> 01:26:00,884
one of his father's
subjects, and...

922
01:26:00,959 --> 01:26:02,891
Peeping Tom?

923
01:26:02,959 --> 01:26:05,947
Interesting boy.
He has his father's eyes.

924
01:26:06,025 --> 01:26:08,718
You don't suspect him,
do you?

925
01:26:08,791 --> 01:26:10,916
I suspect them all.

926
01:26:10,991 --> 01:26:13,480
- Action!
- What about you?

927
01:26:13,559 --> 01:26:17,013
I'm interested in this fantastic
extrovert who brought the girl in.

928
01:26:17,092 --> 01:26:19,115
There's something
on his mind.

929
01:26:19,192 --> 01:26:22,215
No wonder.
He's the director.

930
01:26:22,292 --> 01:26:24,984
Can't manage Saturday, sir.

931
01:26:25,057 --> 01:26:29,490
But... But they're
letting us off early today.

932
01:26:29,557 --> 01:26:33,422
This afternoon after work...
might be my only chance.

933
01:26:33,491 --> 01:26:36,286
Well, uh, be here
at 6:00, Mark.

934
01:26:36,357 --> 01:26:38,289
I'll have Milly waiting.

935
01:26:38,357 --> 01:26:41,720
- 6:00?
- On the dot, Mark, or she'll go.

936
01:26:41,790 --> 01:26:44,347
- I'll be there.
- You'd better be.

937
01:26:44,423 --> 01:26:47,287
- The last shot of the day.
Make it a good one.
- Okay.

938
01:26:47,356 --> 01:26:49,513
- You got your list, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

939
01:26:49,588 --> 01:26:52,645
I want to see how some of them
spend their spare time.

940
01:26:52,721 --> 01:26:55,778
- Which ones?
- Exactly, Sergeant.

941
01:27:59,718 --> 01:28:03,240
- Oh, there you are.
Now, don't make a habit of this.
- I won't, sir.

942
01:28:03,317 --> 01:28:05,476
- Milly's upstairs.
- Thank you, sir.

943
01:28:05,551 --> 01:28:07,642
Now, I've got to go out.
If you finish before I'm back,

944
01:28:07,717 --> 01:28:09,706
lock up and put this
through the letter box.

945
01:28:09,784 --> 01:28:12,511
What are you looking at?
Haven't you seen a key before?

946
01:28:12,584 --> 01:28:15,675
The till will be empty,
if that's what you're smiling about.

947
01:28:15,751 --> 01:28:18,876
Now, remember what I said.
No more of this fancy stuff.

948
01:28:35,549 --> 01:28:39,072
You've spoiled my whole evening,
you have.

949
01:28:39,148 --> 01:28:42,739
- And I had a date with my new boyfriend.
- Sorry, Milly.

950
01:28:42,815 --> 01:28:44,747
Well, what's the idea?

951
01:28:47,314 --> 01:28:49,576
I may not be here tomorrow.

952
01:28:49,648 --> 01:28:53,478
Why? Going on maneuvers with the
Boy Scouts? Now what are you doing?

953
01:28:53,548 --> 01:28:58,242
- I thought so.
- Come on. We haven't got all night.

954
01:28:58,314 --> 01:29:00,836
There's all that nude stuff
on the bed to finish.

955
01:29:07,547 --> 01:29:10,842
Well, of all the...

956
01:29:10,913 --> 01:29:13,379
Have you gone completely crazy?

957
01:29:13,447 --> 01:29:17,504
I'm just completing
a documentary.

958
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:20,068
You're a documentary
and a half, you are.

959
01:29:20,146 --> 01:29:22,236
- I didn't stand up
my gentleman friend...

960
01:29:22,312 --> 01:29:26,301
And come back here and take my clothes
off for you to start filming the street.

961
01:29:33,212 --> 01:29:36,178
I might as well
talk to a zombie.

962
01:29:36,245 --> 01:29:38,802
Is it safe to be alone
with you, I wonder?

963
01:29:38,878 --> 01:29:41,572
Might be more fun
if it wasn't.

964
01:30:38,774 --> 01:30:41,433
Drive straight on.

965
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:52,601
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Tony.

966
01:30:52,673 --> 01:30:56,037
- Where are you going? You...
- To leave something for Mark.

967
01:30:56,107 --> 01:30:58,937
- You haven't much time
for me these days.
- Oh, Tony, I...

968
01:30:59,007 --> 01:31:01,904
It's all right.
I'll be here if you want me.

969
01:31:01,972 --> 01:31:04,961
Oh, by the way, your mother
was yelling out before you came in.

970
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:07,561
Something about Mark
photographing her.

971
01:31:07,639 --> 01:31:10,628
Photographing Mother?
You must be mistaken.

972
01:31:10,705 --> 01:31:13,637
- Of course. Uh, see you sometime.
- Yeah.

973
01:31:20,139 --> 01:31:22,399
Mark?

974
01:31:23,871 --> 01:31:25,803
Mark?

975
01:31:28,005 --> 01:31:29,994
Mark.

976
01:32:30,434 --> 01:32:32,366
I don't know
what to make of it, sir.

977
01:32:32,434 --> 01:32:36,628
He went to a public library,
and then to a newsagent's shop.

978
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:39,495
For private photography,
if you ask me.

979
01:32:39,567 --> 01:32:41,828
Shall I hang around
outside the house, sir?

980
01:32:41,899 --> 01:32:45,093
No. I don't
think so either.

981
01:32:45,166 --> 01:32:48,859
All right, sir. I'll give you
the details when I get back. Bye, sir.

982
01:33:58,328 --> 01:34:00,725
Don't let me
see you are frightened.

983
01:34:00,795 --> 01:34:04,124
- So, leave. Hurry up!
- No!

984
01:34:04,194 --> 01:34:06,126
Leave!

985
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:09,819
Not till I know.

986
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:12,985
- Now.
- That film...

987
01:34:13,061 --> 01:34:15,458
That film is...

988
01:34:15,527 --> 01:34:17,493
just a film,
isn't it?

989
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:20,083
It's horrible.

990
01:34:20,161 --> 01:34:23,354
Horrible. But it's
just a film, isn't it?

991
01:34:24,426 --> 01:34:26,483
No.

992
01:34:29,692 --> 01:34:31,624
No.

993
01:34:31,692 --> 01:34:33,624
I killed them.

994
01:34:42,458 --> 01:34:45,447
You'll be safe, as long as I can't
see you frightened.

995
01:34:45,525 --> 01:34:48,014
So stand in
the shadows, please.

996
01:34:49,092 --> 01:34:51,024
Please.

997
01:34:58,358 --> 01:35:02,051
Inspector Gregg.
What?

998
01:35:02,124 --> 01:35:04,248
Put him on the line.

999
01:35:04,323 --> 01:35:09,381
Peters here. Yes. I went upstairs
to look around, and I found her lying.

1000
01:35:09,457 --> 01:35:11,855
What's the address?

1001
01:35:11,924 --> 01:35:13,856
Newsagent's shop!

1002
01:35:13,924 --> 01:35:18,015
Your mother is right.

1003
01:35:19,156 --> 01:35:22,020
Must tell someone everything.

1004
01:35:23,422 --> 01:35:26,149
Sorry it has to be you.

1005
01:35:30,155 --> 01:35:32,144
This was his workshop.

1006
01:35:33,655 --> 01:35:36,086
And you know
some of what he did,

1007
01:35:37,755 --> 01:35:39,687
but not all.

1008
01:35:46,788 --> 01:35:48,981
Aged five.

1009
01:35:55,154 --> 01:35:57,086
Aged seven.

1010
01:36:00,054 --> 01:36:03,451
All the rooms
were wired for sound,

1011
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:05,748
and they still are.

1012
01:36:07,119 --> 01:36:09,051
Your room.

1013
01:36:09,119 --> 01:36:11,847
- Happy birthday.
- Here. Open this one.

1014
01:36:11,919 --> 01:36:15,875
Your mother's.

1015
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:22,517
- Tony's.
- No one will come in,
honestly, darling.

1016
01:36:22,585 --> 01:36:24,778
- I don't care.
- But, darling.

1017
01:36:24,851 --> 01:36:27,317
- Tony, stop it!
- The door is locked.

1018
01:36:27,385 --> 01:36:29,544
I don't care. I'm scared.

1019
01:36:29,619 --> 01:36:33,608
Turn it off.

1020
01:36:33,685 --> 01:36:36,583
- Look at me, Mark.
- Not if you're frightened.

1021
01:36:36,652 --> 01:36:40,674
Look at me!
What did you do to those girls?

1022
01:36:40,751 --> 01:36:43,444
- No.
- What did you do?

1023
01:36:43,518 --> 01:36:46,712
If you want to torment me for the rest
of my life, then make me imagine.

1024
01:36:46,784 --> 01:36:49,342
What did you do
to those girls?

1025
01:36:49,418 --> 01:36:51,509
I... I can't.

1026
01:36:51,584 --> 01:36:53,516
Show me.

1027
01:36:55,351 --> 01:36:57,509
But if you're
frightened...

1028
01:36:57,583 --> 01:37:00,548
Show me, or I'll remain frightened
for the rest of my life.

1029
01:37:00,616 --> 01:37:02,548
Show me!

1030
01:37:20,481 --> 01:37:23,878
Do you know what the most frightening
thing in the world is?

1031
01:37:30,547 --> 01:37:32,480
It's fear.

1032
01:37:33,547 --> 01:37:36,480
So I did something
very simple.

1033
01:37:37,981 --> 01:37:39,913
Very simple.

1034
01:37:41,347 --> 01:37:45,608
When they felt the spike...

1035
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:47,611
touching their throat,

1036
01:37:49,213 --> 01:37:52,407
and knew I was going
to kill them,

1037
01:37:52,479 --> 01:37:56,605
I made them watch
their own deaths.

1038
01:37:58,047 --> 01:38:00,308
I made them see...

1039
01:38:00,379 --> 01:38:04,004
their own terror
as the spike went in.

1040
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:07,011
And if death has a face,

1041
01:38:07,079 --> 01:38:09,567
they saw that too.

1042
01:38:10,879 --> 01:38:13,209
But not you.

1043
01:38:13,279 --> 01:38:16,540
I promised I'd never
photograph you.

1044
01:38:16,612 --> 01:38:19,170
Not you.

1045
01:38:19,246 --> 01:38:22,404
Frightened for you.

1046
01:38:39,243 --> 01:38:41,175
- Got the men all right?
- Yes, sir.

1047
01:38:41,242 --> 01:38:43,175
- Okay, let's go.
- Look out!

1048
01:38:44,842 --> 01:38:47,831
- It's only a camera.
- Only?

1049
01:38:53,308 --> 01:38:58,434
- Give yourself up, Mark!
- I've been ready for this
for such a long time.

1050
01:38:58,509 --> 01:39:02,406
- What are you doing?
- That's all right.

1051
01:39:06,441 --> 01:39:08,498
All right. He's there!
All right. Come on, then!

1052
01:39:08,574 --> 01:39:10,699
I can beat that.

1053
01:39:16,941 --> 01:39:18,873
Give yourself up, Mark!

1054
01:39:22,273 --> 01:39:24,205
Watch them, Helen.

1055
01:39:24,273 --> 01:39:26,262
Watch them say good-bye.

1056
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:30,397
One by one.
I've timed it so often.

1057
01:39:32,473 --> 01:39:35,996
I wish I could have
found your faces for you.

1058
01:39:43,372 --> 01:39:47,327
Helen! Helen!
I'm afraid.

1059
01:39:47,406 --> 01:39:50,270
No. No. Mark.

1060
01:39:53,339 --> 01:39:57,169
And I'm glad
I'm afraid.

1061
01:40:44,934 --> 01:40:46,866
Girl's alive.

1062
01:40:49,435 --> 01:40:51,696
Go get an ambulance.

1063
01:40:51,768 --> 01:40:55,599
All right.
All right. Don't be a silly boy.

1064
01:40:55,667 --> 01:40:58,827
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

1065
01:41:09,067 --> 01:41:12,760
Good night, Daddy. Hold my hand.
