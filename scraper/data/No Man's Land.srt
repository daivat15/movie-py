1
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,432
We're all waiting for you.

2
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,817
- Hand me that ratchet, will you, Uncle Mike?
- Yeah.

3
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,694
Your mother wants you to cut the turkey.

4
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,354
Have Jimbo do it.

5
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,990
She wants you. You know how she is.

6
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,826
You got your hands full with this one.

7
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,237
That's for sure.

8
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,160
Had my eye on one of these,
a long time ago.

9
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,414
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,373
Did some plumbing work for a guy
who couldn't pay.

11
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:33,457
No kidding.

12
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,418
Yeah, he wanted to trade me
his burgundy Porsche.

13
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:37,707
Should have done it.

14
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:41,420
Come on, you give me a ride
when you get this thing running.

15
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,547
Gotta get yourself cleaned up.

16
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,761
Yeah.

17
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,678
Yeah, I got me a fuckin Oldsmobile instead.

18
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,560
- Rhea, where are the cranberries?
- I put em on the table, Bea.

19
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,071
Somebody make sure the cat
doesn't get into them.

20
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,106
Mary Jean, will you keep an eye on Prowler?

21
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,866
- Where is Benjy?
- He's taking a shower.

22
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:06,995
- Listen, we're gonna eat without you.
- No, you wouldnt.

23
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,618
- Nice gravy, Mom.
- Hotshot!

24
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,033
- Peggy! How you doing?
- Good!

25
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,827
- Gonna give me a nephew?
- Hope so, I'll name it after Dad.

26
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:15,961
Great.

27
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,085
- Who's that?
- Colleen.

28
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,624
Colleen, what happened?

29
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,792
- Somebody swiped your tooth.
- I lost em.

30
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,678
No. You know what?
Tooth Fairy asked me to give this to you.

31
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,339
- Thanks.
- You got it.

32
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,805
How you doing?
Come on. I want to talk to you.

33
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,971
Benjy, will you put this on the
table, please? Watch the cat.

34
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,389
- Hows business?
- Good.

35
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,431
They keeping you busy?

36
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,771
City full of criminals.
A lot of tickets to write.

37
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,401
- So you like it?
- It's okay.

38
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:43,531
If you change your mind,
there's a lot of money to be made in poultry.

39
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:44,941
Your brother-in-law loves it.

40
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,485
Yeah, but he loves Peggy.
What does that prove?

41
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,905
That's my wife you're talking about, there.

42
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,078
It may not be cops and robbers,
but it's a good business.

43
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,163
People always gonna be eating chicken.

44
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:59,172
It's not cops and robbers. It's just a job.
Uncle Mike, will you help me out?

45
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,504
- Why don't you leave Benjy alone.
- I'm talking to Benjy, all right?

46
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,260
What does he need with chicken?

47
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,171
- Who's going to say grace? Benjy?
- How about Mary Jean?

48
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,260
Bless us, Lord, and these, They gifts...

49
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,726
which we are about to receive
from Thy bounty.

50
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,391
Through Christ, our Lord, amen.

51
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,686
- Amen.
- All right. Good job. Okay, let's eat.

52
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,409
You made me look bad.

53
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,537
That's what I'm saying, okay?

54
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,040
I didn't mean to.
I thought he was going to hurt her.

55
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,202
You want to get your butt sawed off,
that's your business.

56
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,461
But if I'm standing there,
I gotta do something.

57
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,247
And I don't want to do nothin.

58
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,503
How are you, Ace?

59
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,169
- I get half the money on that.
- No, you don't.

60
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,678
What do I do with this?

61
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:48,804
Put it up here.

62
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:49,885
Mara.

63
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,845
- Lock these up for us, will you?
- You got it.

64
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,475
I'll have the usual.

65
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,395
Bring the shooters in here, will you, Ben?

66
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,856
Heath.

67
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,603
- What took you guys so long?
- We're driving down the street.

68
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,739
The kid sees this guy
kicking his ladys butt in the parking lot.

69
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,865
He wants me to pull over. We're off duty!

70
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,492
What? Them two on Washington?

71
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,154
- Yeah, you know em?
- Thems two at it all the time.

72
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,197
Beats the shit out of her once a week.

73
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,116
How was I supposed to know that?

74
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:21,079
So the kid, here,
he makes me pull over to a stop...

75
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,293
and he jumps right in the middle of it.

76
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:26,255
Here. Now, I got to do something.

77
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:30,046
Kid, you're off duty.
You see something, call a cop.

78
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,722
I'am a cop.

79
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,639
Here it comes.

80
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,021
No, that's Bracey. Hey, man.

81
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,272
Jaws.

82
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,649
You're a long way from home, Lieutenant.

83
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:46,108
I'm looking for a guy named
Benjamin Taylor.

84
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,274
- That's me.
- That's me, sir.

85
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,283
That's me, sir.

86
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,703
Want to step over here?

87
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,950
I hear you're pretty good
with German cars, Porsches?

88
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,288
I'm okay.

89
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,920
You hear about Nick Grazziola?

90
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,217
- He's the detective that was killed last week.
- Yeah.

91
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,173
I want the guys who got him.

92
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:11,633
You know who did it?

93
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,384
I can't prove it.

94
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,925
I think it's a local
outfit stealing Porsches.

95
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,514
They're operating out of a repair shop.

96
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,227
My moneys on the owner,
a guy named Ted Varrick.

97
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:26,523
I got a snitch working in the place.
He can get somebody in.

98
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:28,275
Me?

99
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:29,647
Maybe.

100
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:32,949
Why me?

101
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,868
Cause you're a mechanic...

102
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:36,704
and you're a rookie.

103
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,119
You won't act like a cop.

104
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:41,955
Grazziola.

105
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,287
He was a friend of yours, wasn't he?

106
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,880
How old are you, son?

107
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,169
22.

108
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,888
You still living at home?

109
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,098
Yeah.

110
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,553
You don't have to prove anything...

111
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,730
not to me.

112
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,642
I'll do it.

113
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,400
Okay.

114
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,777
Okay. Bill Ayles.

115
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,485
Hi, I'm Bill Ayles.

116
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:58,945
How you doing?

117
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,533
Don't forget, asshole.

118
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,751
You guys make sure I know
what you do with the tire gun.

119
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,082
Right.

120
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,396
- Danny, how you doing?
- Bill.

121
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,439
You better have your shit together.

122
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,825
I promised the customer's car today,
so I want it.

123
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,530
I'll be back by 4:00.

124
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,411
You're a smart guy. Right answer.

125
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,455
- What?
- This is Bill Ayles.

126
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,333
- Good for him.
- This is the mechanic I was talking about.

127
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:47,789
How you doing?

128
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,047
How long will it take you to change
the fuel distributor on this SC?

129
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,958
Book says four hours.
I can do it in three. Maybe two.

130
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,172
You charge by the book or hours worked?

131
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,387
Depends on the customer.

132
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,550
This guy says it's running rough,
getting lousy gas mileage.

133
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,188
Says he wants a tune-up.
You got a couple hours?

134
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,061
How about a couple minutes?

135
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,654
Just reach in and adjust the sensor plate.
Sounds a little low.

136
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,989
Try it for a couple days.

137
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:25,160
8:00 to 5:00. And I mean, 8:00, not 8:01.
One hour for lunch.

138
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,492
$14 an hour to start.

139
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,706
- When?
- Right now. Give him a jumpsuit.

140
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,248
Okay, now, no loud music.

141
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,793
No open-door parties.

142
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,303
Last thing I need is the cops.

143
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:41,843
Youll love it here.

144
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,347
Weve got a real family atmosphere.

145
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,683
The sofa was just re-covered.

146
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,227
Carpets less than a year old.

147
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,022
You the decorator?

148
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,521
I got a real eye for color.

149
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,406
- Here are the keys.
- Thanks.

150
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:14,918
Ayles!

151
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,423
You deaf, or you just dumb?

152
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,218
It's called concentration.

153
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,009
- You wanna concentrate on pleasing me?
- By doing what?

154
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:30,180
Guy stuck in the hills in a dead Cabriolet.
Want to go fix him up?

155
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,847
- Nope.
- No?

156
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:35,272
- How about I take that 930?
- You're a dreamer.

157
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,446
Do yourself a favor. Get in your car.
Go out there and pick him up.

158
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:42,484
He owns the place.
Give yourself a little job security.

159
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,947
How about some gas money?

160
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,703
You got a sense of humor.

161
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,503
You a car thief?

162
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:45,671
Malcolm sent me.

163
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,346
I know. I'm just joking. I'm Ted Varrick.

164
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:51,518
Bill Ayles.

165
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,054
- How you doing?
- Nice to meet you.

166
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:56,895
- Nice to meet you. You're the new guy?
- Yeah, I just moved up from San Diego.

167
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,185
What's wrong?

168
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,355
If I knew what was wrong,
I guess you wouldn't be here, right?

169
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,781
Right. I'll take a look.

170
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,917
- Fixed many of these down in San Diego?
- A few.

171
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,211
Gonna have this car raced?

172
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:19,876
Not professionally.

173
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,007
You oughta pick one up for yourself.

174
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,339
That's what I keep telling my loan officer.

175
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,552
You let it out much?

176
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:27,929
As often as possible.

177
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,760
Hold this for me, will you?

178
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,015
Sure.

179
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,604
That should do it.

180
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:37,807
Fire it up.

181
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,815
Nice work.

182
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,576
I'm thinking maybe
I should take it for a test spin.

183
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,825
You wanna drive my car?

184
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,281
Just to make sure.

185
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,243
Just to make sure.

186
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,110
What do you think?

187
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:25,980
I think maybe we fixed it.

188
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,022
Yeah?

189
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,486
Sounds okay.

190
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,910
Just to make sure,
why don't you open her up a little bit.

191
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,041
- Faster.
- We're doing 65.

192
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,005
Then there's plenty left, right?

193
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,525
Go on. Do it.

194
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,282
I should have warned you
about that hairpin back there.

195
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,745
No problem.

196
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,627
It's kinda like you said.
It's good to let it out, right?

197
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,904
I think we definitely fixed it.

198
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:54,568
We're you scared?

199
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,071
No.

200
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,705
Me neither.

201
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,843
Danny, what are you?
Too good to eat with us anymore?

202
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,303
Yeah, I got to be careful
who I hang out with.

203
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,487
- How much money do you think I have?
- Yeah.

204
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,203
- What do you want?
- Id like a word with you.

205
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,034
Come here.

206
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,758
- So, hows it going?
- What are you doing?

207
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,045
Never answer a question with a question.

208
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,596
I asked you, Hows it going?

209
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,007
It's going good.

210
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,097
Well. Say, It's going well.

211
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,936
It's going well.

212
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,184
A little too well. Don't you think?

213
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:06,849
I'm not doing nothin to you.

214
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,733
That's a double negative, Danny.

215
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,483
- Try again.
- I'm not even stealing cars anymore.

216
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,619
You and your friends
stay out of my territory.

217
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,924
- Who we're those guys?
- Insurance salesmen.

218
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,716
- You got a great sense of humor.
- I got a great sense of survival, too, cop.

219
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,971
See how you survive
in county lockup, snitch.

220
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,436
Who the fuck do you think they were?

221
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,484
They're the competition.

222
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:55,613
Thank you.

223
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,930
That looks like Bill.

224
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:26,891
It is Bill.

225
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,145
How you doing?

226
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,352
Mr. Varrick.

227
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,857
- Nice to see you.
- Good to see you.

228
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,313
Wanted to thank you again for
helping me out. I appreciate that.

229
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,608
- No problem. Hows that car running?
- It's running great.

230
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,901
Say, could you hand me the...

231
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:42,243
Thank you.

232
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,494
What are you working on?

233
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,031
Replacing an alarm. Putting in a new one.

234
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:47,916
Something wrong with the old one?

235
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,539
Factory installed.

236
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,996
Cut two wires, and you're home free.

237
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,624
Even the lady who owns this car could do it.

238
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,167
You know a lot about alarms?

239
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,678
- Enough to know a good one.
- Yeah, talk to me.

240
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,053
I'll see you in a few.

241
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:02,385
Okay.

242
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,683
Bill.

243
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,597
- Yeah!
- What are you doing tonight?

244
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,142
- I don't know. Nothing special.
- Great.

245
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:17,188
I'm heading out with friends to a club
and I thought you might like to come.

246
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,446
- Love to.
- Great.

247
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:22,155
Address is on there.
I'll see you, say, like 1:00, 1:30?

248
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,278
- A. M.?
- A. M., yeah.

249
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,537
Just give that to the guy at the door, okay?

250
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,663
- Okay.
- See you tonight.

251
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,824
- All right. Thanks.
- Sure.

252
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,284
Excuse me.

253
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,669
- How you doing?
- Okay.

254
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,045
- Good to see you.
- How are you?

255
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,330
Good.

256
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,374
A guy could get lucky in here.

257
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,714
- Luck doesn't quite cover it.
- Yeah.

258
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,964
- Suzanne.
- Ted.

259
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,929
- You're looking exceptionally lovely tonight.
- Thank you.

260
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,434
- Hi!
- Hi!

261
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:30,936
- How are you?
- Good.

262
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,647
Who was that?

263
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,899
A nice girl with some bad habits.

264
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,144
Fuckin drugs, I hate em.

265
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,274
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

266
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,193
Take a look around, Bill.

267
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,078
Welcome to the lifestyles
of the rich and aimless.

268
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,661
I was about to call
the bureau of missing persons.

269
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,671
- Business, you know how it is.
- Not really.

270
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,626
- I'm sorry. Bill Ayles, my sister, Ann.
- Mr. Goodwrench.

271
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,045
Pleased to meet you.

272
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:47,679
Come on, we're this way.

273
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,014
- Your sister?
- Yeah.

274
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,769
Everybody, this is Bill.
Bill, this is everybody.

275
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,430
- Scoot over, Frenchie.
- Hi.

276
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,896
Bill, meet Margot, she runs this place.
That's Bill.

277
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,527
- Hello.
- Pleased to meet you.

278
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,481
There's somebody at that table
who's been looking for you.

279
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,901
- Do you want to be found?
- Yeah, sure.

280
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:13,413
Do me a favor. Keep this group fed and
watered while I'm gone, okay? Excuse me.

281
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,955
Hows it going?

282
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,089
It's not going so bad.
Hows it going with you?

283
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:24,215
Great.

284
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,503
- Come here often, do you?
- No. All the time.

285
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,762
Funny, I've never seen you here before.

286
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,845
Yeah, this is a big mechanic's hangout.

287
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,975
- You're a mechanic?
- Yes.

288
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,060
If you'll excuse us...

289
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,396
we're going to make a pit stop.

290
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,570
Used to be,
it was girls who powdered their noses.

291
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,731
Morning.

292
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,689
- Don't ever be late for me.
- 10 minutes. What's the big deal?

293
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,979
Every minute you're late,
I got to re-evaluate.

294
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:30,445
Is he in trouble? Is his cover blown?
You got it?

295
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,109
Sorry. It won't happen again.

296
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,696
- What do you got for me?
- There's another car ring.

297
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:36,988
A guy named Martin runs it.

298
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,203
- Yeah. Frank Martin.
- You know about him?

299
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:42,209
He was under arrest the night
Grazziola was murdered.

300
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,336
Stick with the program. Varrick.

301
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,419
I met him, I don't think he's the guy.

302
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,549
- Yeah, why is that?
- He's rich.

303
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:52,512
- You think crime doesn't pay?
- No. I mean rich, rich. Family money.

304
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,263
Took me to this fancy club.

305
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,390
- What happened?
- Nothing, we hung out.

306
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,142
Talked to his sister a little bit.

307
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,771
I guess what's important here
is that you're having a good time.

308
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:03,439
Look, I...

309
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:06,602
I don't even think He's a thief.
I can't see him killing anybody.

310
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:09,317
How many killers have you met
in your life, exactly?

311
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,114
Look, I gotta go to work.

312
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,524
You are at work.

313
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,246
Look, maybe I can try the girl again.

314
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,076
I don't give a shit about the girl.

315
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,834
You think he tells his sister
that he kills people?

316
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,209
I want Varrick.

317
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,087
Now, you concentrate on Varrick.

318
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,726
- Are you taking inventory?
- Damnedest thing, boss.

319
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,387
Brand-new water pump here
with 15,000 miles on it.

320
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,104
Come on.
Are they switching the boxes on me again?

321
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:47,984
These guys.

322
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,944
Let me ask you something.

323
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,072
You interested in picking up
a little extra cash?

324
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,778
Stolen parts business?

325
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:58,245
No, I was thinking more along the lines
of some repo work.

326
00:24:58,539 --> 00:24:59,746
You ever done any?

327
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:02,207
Some. You a car thief, too?

328
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,042
I'm a businessman.

329
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:08,622
Sometimes I sell parts, cars, might as well
fix an old car up, sell it out the back door.

330
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,837
Maybe I should get some plaid pants,
do late-night commercials.

331
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,421
Seriously, somebody took one of our
consignment Porsches a few nights ago.

332
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,261
And it seems like we should take it back.

333
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,309
This ain't exactly repo work.

334
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:23,428
This ain't exactly work, period.

335
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,355
But it's all part of the fight
for truth and justice.

336
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,312
You game?

337
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,316
- You know where it is?
- I'll drive.

338
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:41,370
Check it out.

339
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,746
That's our girl.

340
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,367
You're out of your mind.
What about the valets?

341
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,911
Come on, those guys never pay attention.

342
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,079
Besides, I have the key.

343
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,875
There's two of us, right?

344
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,015
- Fuck it. I'll do it.
- No, I'll do it.

345
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,513
I got a better idea. You do it.

346
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:08,523
Look, Malcolm got the spares
all screwed up, but...

347
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,433
it is definitely one of these.

348
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:12,060
Great.

349
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,104
That's reassuring.

350
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,190
Shit.

351
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,622
What's that guy doing with the Porsche?

352
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,454
Randy, Travis! Send somebody...

353
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,567
Stop him!

354
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,362
Look out!

355
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,440
- You okay?
- Damn it! I almost had it!

356
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,268
Yeah. No shit.

357
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,745
I want to go back and get that car.

358
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,077
Come on, are you out of your mind?

359
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,116
Obviously.

360
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,471
I feel good

361
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:48,933
I knew that I would, now

362
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,390
- So good
- So good

363
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,056
So good 'cause I got you

364
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,613
Why don't you use the Porsche
till tomorrow? You earned it.

365
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,828
- What do you mean?
- Drop it off at the shop.

366
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,118
I'll have someone pick it up in the morning.

367
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,984
Have a cigar.

368
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,237
Don't mind if I do.

369
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,248
- Something to cool your engines?
- Sure, why not?

370
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,702
Too bad about this place.

371
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:00,247
Yeah, it is kind of seedy.

372
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:05,335
- Guess I'll have to suffer. Great hat.
- Thank you.

373
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,723
Cheers.

374
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,226
What are you celebrating?

375
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,557
- Hi.
- How are you?

376
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:17,563
Not as good as you, from the sound of it.

377
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:19,645
- You heard that?
- No. No.

378
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,900
So, what are you two up to?

379
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:26,656
Bill was just teaching me
a little stunt driving, that's all.

380
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,282
Is that true?

381
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:29,818
Sure, why not?

382
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,986
She likes to imagine that I lie a lot.

383
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,655
Makes me sound more exciting.

384
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,323
You're exciting enough.

385
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,125
These college girls, they're so boring.

386
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,582
- Where do you go to school?
- Chicago.

387
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:44,045
She's staying with her so-called parents,
who are on vacation.

388
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,050
Only they're not here...

389
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:47,843
as usual.

390
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:49,629
Didn't they know you were coming home?

391
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:53,345
They're off in France or Libya
or some other foreign paradise.

392
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:56,557
Ann has all 5,000 rooms to herself.

393
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:58,722
She likes to be alone.

394
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,231
Is that true?

395
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,766
Not always.

396
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,564
Maybe you should take that as an invitation.

397
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,105
Maybe it is.

398
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,734
They must have laughed
after they almost caught me...

399
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:14,325
cause I just walked through a store,
out the back, into the car, gone.

400
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:15,989
I couldn't believe I did it.

401
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,032
You're really hating this.

402
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:19,871
You told me to get close to him.

403
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,287
Look, just don't go native on me, all right?

404
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,916
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know exactly what it means.

405
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,501
You want results, right?

406
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:31,091
What I want is something that
I can take into court.

407
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,679
What I don't want is some
smart-ass lawyer getting a cop killer off...

408
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,468
because somebody crossed a line.
You got it?

409
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:43,983
What about the sister?

410
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:46,978
She wouldn't date the help.

411
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,525
At least she's got some common sense.

412
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:28,986
Hi.

413
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:31,943
You been standing there long?

414
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:33,657
Just came around.

415
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,035
The gate was open
and nobody answered when I rang.

416
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,537
I guess I don't hear anything back here.

417
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,494
Would you like the grand tour?

418
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,579
And last but not least...

419
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,123
this is the tennis court.

420
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,750
This is a basketball court.

421
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,129
It depends on how you look at it.

422
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:53,261
Let me guess, Teds into basketball
and you play tennis?

423
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:54,466
Wrong.

424
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:58,132
Introducing Number 32 for Sacred Heart...

425
00:32:58,435 --> 00:32:59,346
Varrick!

426
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,728
Sacred Hearts in trouble this year.
Do you want to play Horse?

427
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:04,434
I want to play Duck.

428
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,269
- How do you play Duck?
- Duck!

429
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,310
- Let's play one-on-one.
- Is it easier than Horse?

430
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:12,981
Sure, you just take the ball and you try
and score. It's like basketball.

431
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,487
Your game. You go first.

432
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,075
Okay.

433
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,249
Is that the phone?

434
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,918
- That's completely unfair.
- Whatever it takes.

435
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,465
Is that as close as you're gonna get?

436
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,430
Your brother teach you this?

437
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,011
I taught him.

438
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,812
- Are you okay?
- That's okay, no blood, no foul.

439
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:45,892
So humor me.

440
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,025
Foul on Number 32, Varrick. Cmon.

441
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,734
I figured you for a heartbreaker.
I didn't know my nose was in jeopardy.

442
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,657
You'll be fine.

443
00:33:57,077 --> 00:34:00,286
- How long do I have to keep doing this?
- Till I tell you to stop.

444
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,617
Here, have a seat.

445
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,538
Put your head back.

446
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:12,340
How long have you and Ted been friends?

447
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,717
- Since I...
- Put that head back!

448
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:19,301
- Since I helped him out of a jam.
- Yeah? What kind of a jam?

449
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,885
His car wouldn't start.

450
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,800
That's not much of a jam for Ted.

451
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:25,595
- He's been in bigger, has he?
- You could say that.

452
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,347
Maybe he's learning.

453
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:28,639
Learning what?

454
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:30,854
How to choose his friends more carefully.

455
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,566
Okay, sit up.

456
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,986
- Stopped?
- Yeah.

457
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:40,697
Youre good.

458
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,703
Blood brings out the mother in me.

459
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,159
I already got a mother.

460
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:54,214
Einstein.

461
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,217
You just dropped three years
of your salary here.

462
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,135
Danny Millers on Line 4.

463
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:05,760
Come on, Malcolm wants you.

464
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:33,542
Bill. Malcolm wants to see you.

465
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:36,923
Showtime, bro.

466
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,633
- You really like this shit?
- Yeah!

467
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,937
What are you, my father or something?

468
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,222
Just drive.

469
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,175
A bunch of Mercedes.

470
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:22,928
A couple Rollses.

471
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:26,553
A Ferrari. I don't see no Porsches, man.
I got tickets to the Lakers.

472
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,307
You're not going anywhere
until we get a car.

473
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,244
Clifford. Too tough.

474
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:06,301
Just got lucky.

475
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,310
It's awful close to the elevator.
Let's look some more.

476
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,645
What, you want one with keys in it, too?

477
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:20,311
Just keep your goddamn eyes open.

478
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,361
Get your hands up!

479
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:52,533
Get out of the car! Get over here!

480
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:55,705
Got him?

481
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,333
- Go downstairs and call the cops.
- Right.

482
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,419
Keep moving. Back off.

483
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:02,795
Move it out.

484
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,332
Keep moving. Back off.

485
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:10,884
Keep your hands off our cars.

486
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,909
Sure took your time.

487
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,951
Can I have my personal property, please?

488
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,951
- Thanks.
- Shut up.

489
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:46,382
Malcolm gives all the orders. I've got
nothing to connect Varrick to any of it.

490
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:49,589
Just because he's smarter than you,
doesn't mean he's innocent.

491
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:53,507
There's a telephone in there and I want you
to go in there and call Malcolm...

492
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,846
and tell him in your own words
exactly what went down today.

493
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,678
Let him use the phone.

494
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,147
What, you want me to dial it for you?

495
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,621
Malcolm, it's Bill.

496
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,456
You heard.

497
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:21,329
He's what?

498
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:22,618
He's sorry?

499
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:26,085
That sorry fuckin kid took me off,
and left me hanging!

500
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:29,671
It was fucking amateur night! Wait.
Sorry? Sorry isn't good enough!

501
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,177
Find yourself another fool, cause I'm out!

502
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,509
Shit. I just quit.

503
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,800
Means he'll come to you.

504
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:39,806
So, it's okay?

505
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,938
Kid, you sent chills up my spine.

506
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:51,271
Hi.

507
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,031
Ann, I'm sorry.

508
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:57,074
- You must be angry.
- Not really, I was angry two hours ago.

509
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,579
I knew this was a bad idea.

510
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:01,619
Should I go?

511
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:03,250
What happened to your hand?

512
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,752
A self-inflicted wound.

513
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,004
Is it bad?

514
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,003
If a little blood
brought out the mother in you...

515
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,419
I'd try a lot of blood, see what happened.

516
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:29,230
Make my bacon extra crispy, please.

517
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:33,197
- You're just in time.
- Hello, Ann.

518
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:37,572
- Morning.
- Ann, you shouldn't have, really.

519
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,119
Thank you. You got any coffee?

520
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:42,122
- Sure.
- Great.

521
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:47,586
All right.

522
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,790
This is terrific. Thank you very much.

523
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:53,425
- Long night?
- Yeah.

524
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,387
Morning.

525
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,061
Nice robe, chief.

526
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,396
Where can I get a mug?

527
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,274
Looks better on you than it does on me.

528
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,862
Sit down. Eat.

529
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,115
- Have you tasted her crepes?
- No.

530
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:24,703
Ann, give Bill a crepe.
This shit will melt in your mouth.

531
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:42,928
You sleep okay last night?

532
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,557
Yes, I slept pretty well.

533
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:47,596
Is there any milk?

534
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,279
I like this.

535
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:04,371
I really like this. It feels very domestic.

536
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:05,872
But good domestic.

537
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,826
Maybe you guys should go
work in the 3.2 kids.

538
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,710
Uncle Ted could visit on the holidays.

539
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:14,043
- It's 2.3 kids.
- I think it's 3.2 beer.

540
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,629
Take it easy, Uncle Ted.

541
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:27,811
I always hated this
fuckin house at Christmas.

542
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,139
Let's do something different this year.

543
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:33,184
Let's have a party.

544
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:38,822
We'll hire a band. Fill this place up.
Put some life in this morgue.

545
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:41,074
- What do you think?
- Sounds great.

546
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:43,076
You're invited. What do you say, Ann?

547
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:45,203
Okay.

548
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,372
All right, I'll fix it up.

549
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,661
I've got to make a few phone calls.

550
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,417
Meet me outside when you're done.

551
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:56,706
- Okay.
- Okay.

552
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,250
Thanks for the grub, kiddo.

553
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,169
- Sure.
- See you later.

554
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,726
You okay?

555
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:12,310
I have to get dressed.

556
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,602
I'll call you later.

557
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,145
Yes, do.

558
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:20,568
No, absolutely not.

559
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,693
It just doesn't work that way.
Okay? You tell him that.

560
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,987
Okay, good-bye.

561
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,703
Ready?

562
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:34,245
What the hell happened to your hand, man?
She didn't bite you, did she?

563
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:36,334
No, one of Martin's people cut me yesterday.

564
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:37,713
Son of a bitch.

565
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:40,217
The backup man
Malcolm stuck me with split.

566
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,548
- Could have been a lot worse.
- Did you get busted?

567
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,258
No, I managed to get away.

568
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:47,766
You got my word
this is not gonna happen again.

569
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,926
I'm gonna partner you
with the best guy I got.

570
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:52,391
- Yeah, who's that?
- Who do you think?

571
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,852
- Merry Christmas, gentlemen.
- Thank you, sir.

572
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:58,770
- Did she say $9,300?
- $93,000.

573
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,106
- Let's do it.
- All right.

574
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,025
- You look terrific.
- Thanks.

575
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:06,409
Yeah.

576
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,366
The shopping bags the ticket.

577
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:11,281
You can stand there all day long
if you hold the right bag.

578
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:12,950
- Makes sense, right?
- Sure.

579
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:15,168
What about this one? Not too shabby.

580
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:18,088
Italian trash.

581
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,462
Besides, I only steal Porsches.

582
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:23,294
Like that one.

583
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:24,586
Come on.

584
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:33,853
All right, this ones on me.

585
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,327
Hello.

586
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,715
Be my guest.

587
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,673
One. Two.

588
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,175
Three.

589
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:08,907
This baby handles!

590
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:13,036
What is this shit? Noise.

591
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:18,162
Good Lord. Definite trash.

592
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:21,579
I can't believe people
still listen to this shit!

593
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,175
Answer it, man. It's probably for you.

594
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:32,885
Hello.

595
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,096
No, Ricks not here.

596
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:39,183
Who am I?

597
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,723
I'm the guy stealing Ricks car.

598
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:53,034
You know, those guys said to back off.

599
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:54,573
Fuck em.

600
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:54,550
There! The elevator!

601
00:48:58,561 --> 00:48:59,426
Go!

602
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:01,560
Come on!

603
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:12,189
Don't you think were pushing our luck?

604
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:13,523
No such thing.

605
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:15,818
I nabbed seven of these in one day.

606
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,322
Your turn.

607
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,055
Dubious.

608
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:40,179
This guy deserves us.

609
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,641
So, who picks up the cars?

610
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:46,932
Malcolms got a guy on it.

611
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,315
Where's he take em?

612
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:55,486
- Stop. This is too good to pass up.
- Terrific, just great.

613
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:03,098
There!

614
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:23,949
What now?

615
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:25,914
Buckle up.

616
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:29,538
Come on!

617
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,249
Come on! Get the fuck in here!

618
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,084
Come on! Go!

619
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:13,166
Come on! Go! Shit! Move it!

620
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:16,422
Back up, back up. Now. Go!

621
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:02,760
Any ideas?

622
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:05,509
- Yeah, head for the hills.
- I'm serious.

623
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:07,681
Punch it!

624
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:58,433
What happened?

625
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:08,906
Shit.

626
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,316
Terrific idea you had, here.

627
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:50,534
Relax.

628
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,644
I met this girl, not too long ago...

629
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:21,357
with blonde hair, the greenest eyes.

630
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,227
Christ, you should have seen her.

631
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:25,486
Yeah?

632
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,323
She's so fucking beautiful.

633
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:31,825
Sounds like it.

634
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,864
You got a big responsibility here.

635
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:38,616
I do?

636
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:41,369
Yeah, she told me that...

637
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:44,669
it really hurts her
when a guy says hell call...

638
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,003
and he doesn't.

639
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:07,733
Come on, go. Come on.

640
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,075
They're over there!

641
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:03,417
- These guys ever give up?
- They do this for a living.

642
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:19,759
Showtime, folks.

643
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:22,451
Boss-man.

644
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,035
Ted. How you doing?

645
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,496
- Kinda slow day.
- A little bit, yeah.

646
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:28,127
Breaking in the new guy.

647
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:29,378
Malcolm.

648
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:31,665
Were doing our Christmas
shopping a little early?

649
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:34,801
Absolutely. Got to be a step ahead
of the competitors.

650
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:37,845
- Look familiar?
- Jesus!

651
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:39,130
Watch out, guys.

652
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:45,349
Horton, here, can chop up a car in about
two hours. There's nobody faster.

653
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:51,100
Duncan's a surgeon with switching
numbers. Every car gets a new life.

654
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:57,023
- Junkyards, right?
- Yeah. Junkyards, impound lots.

655
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:58,907
We even got a guy at the DMV.

656
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:07,204
What's up?

657
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:10,290
I want to talk to you about
some security problems.

658
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:13,172
- How about tomorrow at the shop?
- Sure. First thing.

659
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:14,378
Is everything cool?

660
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:15,837
It's gonna be.

661
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,756
All right.

662
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:20,676
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

663
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:26,435
- Problems?
- No.

664
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:36,279
Nothing this won't fix.

665
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,442
- What's this for?
- A little bonus for the stunt driving.

666
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:43,114
Good helps hard to come by, these days.

667
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,572
Come on, bro. I got something to show you.

668
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:48,161
Remember your first repo?

669
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:49,450
You painted it.

670
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,043
She's yours.

671
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:57,292
Clean, clear, and legal.

672
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,656
Yeah. Looks good on you.

673
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:17,663
Bill?

674
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:20,883
- Jesus, what are you doing here?
- I wanted to see you.

675
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:22,797
Whered you get the car?

676
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:26,472
It's a customers car.
Teds letting me drive while I fix it.

677
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:28,928
Is Ted letting you wear his clothes, too?

678
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:32,929
No, he's... It was a fancy party
that I had to pick up a car at.

679
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:36,850
He didn't want me to go looking like a
mechanic, so, he gave me some cash and...

680
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:37,983
You like it?

681
01:01:38,737 --> 01:01:40,103
I don't like it on you.

682
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:41,729
I'll take it off.

683
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,151
Same old Bill.

684
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,116
You asked for it.

685
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:51,497
Have a seat. I'll get us a couple beers.

686
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,953
I'm getting rid of that couch.
Do not despair.

687
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:59,417
There's only one. We have to share it.

688
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:01,131
It's okay.

689
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:12,805
Tell me I'm being paranoid.

690
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:14,974
You're being paranoid.

691
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:19,392
- What are you being paranoid about?
- You.

692
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:22,103
This place.

693
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,532
- You don't like this place?
- It's like no one lives here.

694
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,992
Ann, I just moved in.

695
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:31,153
I haven't had a chance to hang my art.

696
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:36,829
Have I made a mistake?

697
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:39,746
What mistake?

698
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,170
I thought youd be good for Ted.

699
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:49,759
I'am.

700
01:02:50,058 --> 01:02:52,015
I thought hed finally found someone...

701
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:55,140
- who he couldn't lead around by the nose.
- Yeah.

702
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:00,649
Don't lie to me.

703
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:05,446
- If you guys are involved with something...
- We're just friends.

704
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,070
I don't like Teds friends.

705
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,033
I'm different.

706
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:17,533
- Are you?
- Yeah.

707
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:23,373
- Id like to believe that.
- Yeah.

708
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:25,587
Believe it.

709
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:24,062
Malcolm.

710
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:44,124
You hiding?

711
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:50,627
What? Did you fall in?

712
01:04:53,181 --> 01:04:55,468
Boss-man, I got a cookie for you.

713
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:04,974
Shit.

714
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:23,660
Cut the bullshit insinuations.
I called you guys, remember?

715
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:25,078
No. You didn't.

716
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:29,294
One of your mechanics saw you dragging
a body out of the bathroom. He called us.

717
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:32,009
I wasn't gonna leave him dead
in the goddamn toilet.

718
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:33,510
Where were you taking him?

719
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:34,716
To lunch.

720
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:37,594
I was trying to give him
some fucking dignity.

721
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:39,349
What were you worried about?

722
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:41,719
You're afraid we might find something?

723
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,808
I'm never worried about guys like you.

724
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:48,271
If you destroyed or altered any evidence,
I'm gonna find out and charge you.

725
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:49,651
Fine.

726
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:53,026
You got a real clear conscience, don't you?

727
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:55,736
You tell me, cop.

728
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:58,994
Listen to me, you little asshole.

729
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,406
Rich boys like you turn my stomach.

730
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:05,122
You know the difference between right
and wrong, and you don't give a shit.

731
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:09,289
You know what they do to boys like you
in the joint, do you, smart mouth?

732
01:06:09,591 --> 01:06:13,084
You better get yourself an education,
because that's where you're headed...

733
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:16,174
and I'm gonna send you there.
I guaran-fuckin-tee!

734
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:21,842
You finished?

735
01:06:23,605 --> 01:06:24,470
Get lost.

736
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:32,068
Who's next?

737
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:34,438
Bill Ayles, mechanic.

738
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:36,611
Bring him in.

739
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:43,197
You okay?

740
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:45,290
What?

741
01:06:45,585 --> 01:06:46,496
You okay?

742
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:48,870
I don't know.

743
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:51,542
Bill Ayles?

744
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:55,460
Look, man, I gotta get out of here.
I'll call you, okay?

745
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:02,721
Lieutenant, I think maybe
I got a tie-in to some stolen parts, here.

746
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,853
- Run it down for me will you? I'm busy.
- Sure.

747
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:07,937
Are you Ayles?

748
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:11,608
Cut the crap now.

749
01:07:12,237 --> 01:07:14,354
You gonna interrogate me, Lieutenant?

750
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:18,570
The first thing you're gonna do, punk,
is sit down and answer a few questions.

751
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:21,281
Who the hell do you think you're talking to?

752
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:22,569
Sorry.

753
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:29,371
How long have you worked here?

754
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:32,246
About three, three-and-a-half weeks.

755
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:37,084
What time did you get to work this morning?

756
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:40,130
I was a little late. I got here about 8:45.

757
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:58,315
Don't you ever blow your cover like that
in front of anybody.

758
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:00,573
- They were cops.
- I don't give a shit.

759
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:03,110
You're who I say you are
until I say otherwise.

760
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:05,450
I figured with Malcolm dead, it would be...

761
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,740
Nothings over until I pull the plug.
Understand?

762
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:09,874
Why don't you do it
before somebody else dies?

763
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:11,159
Because I want Varrick!

764
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:12,828
He didn't kill your guy.

765
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:16,339
- What, he confide that in you?
- That's not who Ted is!

766
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:17,590
Ted!

767
01:08:18,386 --> 01:08:20,127
What are we, best buddies now?

768
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:23,301
- How involved are you?
- I don't know. Involved.

769
01:08:23,725 --> 01:08:27,139
Look. I'm sick of lying.
I can't do this anymore. I feel dirty.

770
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:32,223
I don't even know when I'm lying anymore.

771
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:46,241
I want you to take a few days. Back off.

772
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:47,495
What do you mean?

773
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:51,033
Just what I said.
Go home for Christmas, see the family.

774
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:52,876
You taking me off?

775
01:08:56,174 --> 01:08:57,130
No.

776
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,833
I'm just telling you to take a break.

777
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:02,711
We'll talk in a few days.

778
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,053
- Go on.
- Okay.

779
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,186
And stay away from Varrick.

780
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:12,998
Merry Christmas.

781
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:19,622
It's open.

782
01:10:27,432 --> 01:10:29,014
I'm really sorry about Malcolm.

783
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:30,264
How are you?

784
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,052
I'm fair at best. Thank you for coming by.

785
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:35,062
I appreciate that.

786
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:37,564
Why don't I call Ann?
We'll cancel this thing.

787
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:41,478
No. I've got to deal with all this
on a business level, you know?

788
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:44,897
Listen, I have to ask you a favor.

789
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:46,155
Sure.

790
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:56,409
I need you to watch my back tonight.

791
01:10:56,753 --> 01:10:58,164
No, I'm not into this.

792
01:10:58,546 --> 01:11:00,082
We're just going to talk.

793
01:11:00,548 --> 01:11:02,084
Then what do I need this for?

794
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:05,126
Because it would enhance
my sense of security.

795
01:11:16,564 --> 01:11:19,432
- This is stupid.
- No, it's not stupid!

796
01:11:21,736 --> 01:11:23,773
I know who had Malcolm popped.

797
01:11:24,071 --> 01:11:28,065
It was Martin. He's trying to shut me down
and I'm not going to let that happen.

798
01:11:28,451 --> 01:11:31,489
See, if I increase my
visibility, it won't work.

799
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:35,121
Shit.

800
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:38,996
Come on.

801
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:41,707
Think of it as an ICBM.

802
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:46,125
You're never gonna use the fucker, but you
sleep better at night knowing you have one.

803
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:47,543
What, that's it?

804
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:50,797
Yes. Do you think I'm gonna
take somebody out on Christmas Eve?

805
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:52,054
Give me a break.

806
01:11:56,437 --> 01:12:01,148
I will never ask you for anything else again.
Just do me a favor, man.

807
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:04,101
Just watch my back tonight.

808
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:07,108
Just talk?

809
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:09,189
Piece of cake.

810
01:13:27,862 --> 01:13:30,320
Ted, this is crazy. They could be anywhere.

811
01:13:30,615 --> 01:13:32,857
I know he's in one of these fucking clubs.

812
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:51,174
We'll just be a second. Don't park it, okay?

813
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:31,672
I don't see him.

814
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:34,751
- What?
- I don't see him.

815
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:38,468
Why don't you check the bar downstairs.
I'll meet you outside, by the car.

816
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:28,848
- This is for Malcolm.
- What?

817
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:31,267
This is for Malcolm.

818
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:56,420
Ted, good to see you.

819
01:15:56,886 --> 01:16:00,926
Ted! Boy wonder. Merry Christmas.
Good to see you.

820
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:02,680
Is someone having car trouble?

821
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:05,012
- Isthat your white convertible?
- That's mine.

822
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:08,429
- There's a cop out there.
- I hope there's no drugs in there.

823
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:12,691
- Suzanne, you seen my sister anywhere?
- She's upstairs. You can't miss her.

824
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,146
All right.

825
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:17,191
- Hi. You want to dance?
- Not yet.

826
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:24,653
- Let's get you something to drink.
- Okay.

827
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:27,956
Eric, something wet for my buddy, here.

828
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:29,741
Champagnell work.

829
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:35,004
Not bad.

830
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:44,764
- Hello. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

831
01:16:45,059 --> 01:16:46,425
Who do I kiss first?

832
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:53,064
I was afraid you weren't going make it.

833
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:54,975
Last-minute Christmas shopping.

834
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:56,267
Here you go, Ann.

835
01:16:57,154 --> 01:16:58,861
- Can I open it?
- Yes, please.

836
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:01,990
- What is it?
- It's a bowling ball. What do you think?

837
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:03,825
It's beautiful.

838
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,531
Let's see how it looks.

839
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:13,831
You know, somebody called.
Somebodys been trying to reach you.

840
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:14,916
- Really?
- Yeah.

841
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:17,547
Okay. Let me take care of that
for two seconds.

842
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:20,542
You look fantastic.

843
01:17:20,845 --> 01:17:22,552
- You sound surprised.
- I'm not.

844
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:42,150
Could I speak to Mr. Loos, please?

845
01:17:42,449 --> 01:17:44,657
I left three messages.
Where the fuck have you been?

846
01:17:44,952 --> 01:17:46,534
I'm on the phone. What's the problem?

847
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:49,116
Listen, hotshot, I'm out as of now.

848
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:50,656
I want $20,000.

849
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:51,994
I want it tomorrow.

850
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:55,627
Look, if you're getting scared, quit.
Why should I finance your old age?

851
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:57,332
I put that cop away for you.

852
01:17:58,132 --> 01:17:59,668
But I can get immunity...

853
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:01,424
tell them that you ordered it.

854
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:06,051
You'll go down for murder one,
you'll be away for a long time.

855
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:07,304
Okay.

856
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:09,432
This is for the $20,000.

857
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:12,428
They got an undercover in your shop,
a mechanic.

858
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:15,055
That blonde kid, Ayles.

859
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:21,145
You sure about this?

860
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:22,528
You know I'm sure.

861
01:18:23,741 --> 01:18:25,733
Son of a bitch.

862
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,617
Lt. Bracey put him on you.

863
01:18:27,912 --> 01:18:29,904
The guys got your balls on a platter.

864
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:32,663
Okay.

865
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:34,908
Fine.

866
01:18:47,765 --> 01:18:50,428
- How about some champagne?
- Sure.

867
01:18:59,944 --> 01:19:01,901
You're really stuck on him.

868
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:07,407
Something wrong with that?

869
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:11,619
No, I'm just looking out
for my little sister, that's all.

870
01:19:15,793 --> 01:19:16,783
What's up?

871
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:20,837
We got a little business.

872
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:25,041
Open it.

873
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:38,437
Am I supposed to ask who it's for?

874
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:39,894
Do you care?

875
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:42,646
Yeah.

876
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:45,813
Some guy on Martin's payroll.
It's a goodwill gesture.

877
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:47,481
We're buying a truce.

878
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:50,608
The guys a cop.

879
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:54,120
No shit?

880
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:56,743
Big surprise.

881
01:19:58,085 --> 01:19:59,121
Know the guy?

882
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:02,916
I never met him.

883
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:28,446
- All right.
- Let me make the drop.

884
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:31,074
Then I can wait around
and get a look at the guy.

885
01:20:31,452 --> 01:20:33,114
That's not necessary.

886
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:36,287
It can't hurt to know who he is.
Might come in handy later.

887
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:41,831
You catch on pretty fast in this game,
don't you?

888
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:43,287
Got a good teacher.

889
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:46,961
Where is he?

890
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:50,544
He's right through there.
Just behind that freight car.

891
01:22:13,095 --> 01:22:15,132
What the fuck are you doing here?

892
01:22:18,976 --> 01:22:20,012
Spread em!

893
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:24,096
- Take it easy!
- You take it easy. Shut the fuck up!

894
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:28,267
- I didn't know you were working on this.
- I said, shut up! You wearing a wire?

895
01:22:28,569 --> 01:22:29,730
- No!
- Hold still.

896
01:22:30,028 --> 01:22:32,566
It's not what you think!
Listen! Let me tell you!

897
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:34,276
It's not what you think!

898
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:39,945
Hands behind your head!
Put em back! Get down on your knees!

899
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:42,705
- What are you gonna do?
- Open the bag!

900
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:44,328
Let me see it!

901
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:46,659
Count it!

902
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:48,123
- Listen...
- Hurry up!

903
01:22:48,422 --> 01:22:50,505
Here, it's all packets of $2,000 in $20s!

904
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:57,755
You don't have to do this.
We can take him in together!

905
01:22:58,056 --> 01:23:00,264
Kid, you are so far in over your fuckin head!

906
01:23:00,559 --> 01:23:03,142
Put the money back in the bag!
Throw it here.

907
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:06,228
Down on your face!
Hands behind your head.

908
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:13,353
Shit!

909
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:15,191
Listen, you don't want to kill me.

910
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:17,983
Lieutenant! You don't wanna kill a cop!

911
01:23:18,285 --> 01:23:19,821
I already did.

912
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,381
- Get the money!
- You killed a cop!

913
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:43,891
We had no choice! Get in the car. Come on!

914
01:23:54,613 --> 01:23:55,694
You saved my life.

915
01:23:55,989 --> 01:23:57,400
What'd you expect?

916
01:23:59,243 --> 01:24:01,405
- You all right?
- Hard to breathe.

917
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:05,571
The fuckin cops.

918
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:08,120
They're all dirty.

919
01:24:09,127 --> 01:24:11,585
Goes all the way up. Captains, lieutenants...

920
01:24:12,506 --> 01:24:13,872
Theyve all got a price.

921
01:24:16,927 --> 01:24:19,135
A guy who crosses the line like that...

922
01:24:20,681 --> 01:24:22,217
he can't go back.

923
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:24,932
Who can he talk to?

924
01:24:25,519 --> 01:24:27,351
Who can he really trust?

925
01:24:29,648 --> 01:24:30,729
Nobody.

926
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:34,525
Not like us.

927
01:24:35,195 --> 01:24:36,561
We're family.

928
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:39,734
We own each other.

929
01:24:55,382 --> 01:24:56,668
Bill.

930
01:24:57,843 --> 01:25:01,211
Let's meet tomorrow night,
at that shopping mall. Same place.

931
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:05,590
Be the day after Christmas.
People will be taking shit back.

932
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:07,975
Be plenty of cars.

933
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:10,303
Be good for you.

934
01:25:41,094 --> 01:25:43,336
Fuckin Loos was on the take,
tried to kill me!

935
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:44,971
What are you talking about?

936
01:25:45,265 --> 01:25:46,927
Your guy Loos, he's dead!

937
01:25:47,851 --> 01:25:50,514
- What?
- He was gonna kill me. Ted ran him over.

938
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:53,600
- What's going on?
- Nothing, honey, just go back to bed.

939
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:55,106
Don't worry about it.

940
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,516
- The kids...
- I know.

941
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:58,317
What are we going to do?

942
01:25:58,612 --> 01:26:01,195
What do you mean?
We're gonna roll up Varrick.

943
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:03,982
You don't understand! Ted saved my life!

944
01:26:04,284 --> 01:26:06,276
- Yeah, he's also killed two cops!
- No, he hasnt!

945
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:08,865
It was Loos killed Grazziola,
Ted didn't do it!

946
01:26:09,331 --> 01:26:12,074
- What?
- It was Loos, he admitted it to me!

947
01:26:12,376 --> 01:26:14,584
- What we're you doing with Loos?
- Ted took me.

948
01:26:14,878 --> 01:26:17,461
A payoff he was making,
part of a deal he made with Martin.

949
01:26:17,756 --> 01:26:20,624
Yeah? Let me tell you something
about Martin.

950
01:26:20,926 --> 01:26:23,669
He got his ass shot off last night
in some disco.

951
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:25,506
Who do you think did that?

952
01:26:26,139 --> 01:26:27,880
We can bust Varrick now.

953
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:29,924
You can testify that he killed Loos.

954
01:26:30,227 --> 01:26:33,937
I'm not some fuckin snitch!
I told you, he did it to save my life!

955
01:26:34,231 --> 01:26:36,939
Bullshit. He set you up.

956
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:38,774
You're a cop.

957
01:26:39,069 --> 01:26:41,436
Another cop was killed, and you we're there.

958
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:42,854
Maybe Loos was dirty.

959
01:26:43,156 --> 01:26:44,988
Maybe? What is this maybe?

960
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:47,028
Whose side are you on, anyway?

961
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:48,158
Careful.

962
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:50,570
Why, were you in with Loos or something?

963
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:00,705
You get the hell out of my house right now!

964
01:27:09,683 --> 01:27:10,844
Call me tomorrow.

965
01:27:11,518 --> 01:27:12,759
We'll work it out.

966
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:01,982
- Are you okay?
- Hi.

967
01:28:02,486 --> 01:28:04,728
You sounded so upset when you called.

968
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:06,237
Upset?

969
01:28:13,205 --> 01:28:15,822
I need to say something.
It's important you believe me.

970
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:18,207
I never wanted it like this. I never...

971
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:23,747
I never meant for us, for me to come
on to you, for us to get involved.

972
01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:25,247
It just happened.

973
01:28:25,926 --> 01:28:27,133
And I'm glad it did.

974
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:28,463
Me, too.

975
01:28:28,762 --> 01:28:30,469
Now things have gotten out of hand.

976
01:28:30,764 --> 01:28:32,551
I don't know how it's gonna turn out.

977
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:34,598
I just wanted to tell you...

978
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:36,596
whatever happens...

979
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:38,727
it's nothing to do with me and you.

980
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:42,314
What can I do?

981
01:28:46,613 --> 01:28:49,447
Just believe me, no matter what.

982
01:28:51,243 --> 01:28:52,609
I believe you.

983
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:12,712
Where are you going?

984
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:16,674
I'm gonna make you some breakfast.

985
01:29:20,522 --> 01:29:21,933
Stay put.

986
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:00,472
Hey, Grease.

987
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:12,571
Yeah, there he is.

988
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:14,155
Hi, Benjy.

989
01:30:15,285 --> 01:30:18,619
We just had the damnedest time
trying to figuring out who you were.

990
01:30:19,748 --> 01:30:22,456
I figured, I was at the wrong
apartment altogether.

991
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:24,333
She's going, There's no Benjy here.

992
01:30:24,628 --> 01:30:25,994
I'm saying, Yeah.

993
01:30:26,296 --> 01:30:29,084
Benjy Taylor, blond kid, so high...

994
01:30:42,562 --> 01:30:47,057
Anyway, I figured I'd, you know,
bring you your Christmas presents.

995
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:48,432
Thanks.

996
01:30:48,735 --> 01:30:50,727
You didn't pick them up.
Your mother was worried.

997
01:30:51,029 --> 01:30:52,395
Thanks, Uncle Mike.

998
01:30:53,239 --> 01:30:54,150
So...

999
01:30:58,745 --> 01:31:00,031
I guess I'll run along.

1000
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:01,662
It's nice meeting you.

1001
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:06,621
- Bye.
- Yeah.

1002
01:31:18,807 --> 01:31:20,264
It was Ted, wasn't it?

1003
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:22,178
Ann...

1004
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:27,684
You're a fucking cop.

1005
01:31:27,983 --> 01:31:29,724
- Ann...
- Don't touch me!

1006
01:31:35,198 --> 01:31:36,154
Wait.

1007
01:31:38,034 --> 01:31:41,493
- Wait, will you listen to me?
- What could you possibly say?

1008
01:31:42,455 --> 01:31:44,071
How could you lie to me like that?

1009
01:31:44,374 --> 01:31:45,740
I never lied about us.

1010
01:31:46,209 --> 01:31:49,043
Us? There never was an us.

1011
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:51,875
I never even knew your name.

1012
01:31:59,389 --> 01:32:00,925
I don't even know who you are.

1013
01:32:02,809 --> 01:32:04,766
I can't even imagine who you are.

1014
01:32:28,918 --> 01:32:30,284
I need Lt. Bracey.

1015
01:32:31,296 --> 01:32:33,208
This is Deputy Taylor.

1016
01:32:37,302 --> 01:32:38,463
Where?

1017
01:32:42,223 --> 01:32:43,589
Crime Impact.

1018
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:52,974
Sheriff's deputy. It's my fault.
Crime Impact, Taylor.

1019
01:32:53,276 --> 01:32:55,734
- I got to see this guy.
- It's all right, let him in.

1020
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:02,570
- Why are you here?
- We we're supposed to get together.

1021
01:33:02,869 --> 01:33:03,734
I need to talk to him.

1022
01:33:04,037 --> 01:33:05,699
It ain't gonna happen now, is it?

1023
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:36,562
Go home.

1024
01:33:36,986 --> 01:33:38,318
Your assignments over.

1025
01:33:42,742 --> 01:33:46,235
Okay, so, Flight 147, first class, beautiful.

1026
01:33:47,122 --> 01:33:49,079
I'll pay at the terminal. Thank you.

1027
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:28,490
Hi.

1028
01:34:29,122 --> 01:34:30,203
Hi.

1029
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:34,203
Are you going somewhere?

1030
01:34:34,794 --> 01:34:37,628
Yeah, something came up,
and I got to leave town for a while.

1031
01:34:38,214 --> 01:34:39,170
When?

1032
01:34:40,049 --> 01:34:40,960
Tonight.

1033
01:34:41,885 --> 01:34:44,878
- What have I forgotten? Shit.
- What came up?

1034
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:47,672
You know, just business.

1035
01:34:53,771 --> 01:34:57,310
- Shit. Where are my keys?
- What kind of business?

1036
01:34:57,609 --> 01:34:59,692
Just business, you know?

1037
01:35:00,403 --> 01:35:01,644
Does Bill know you're going?

1038
01:35:01,946 --> 01:35:03,232
No. Why?

1039
01:35:03,823 --> 01:35:04,904
Just wondering.

1040
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:08,947
- Where is Bill? Have you seen him?
- No. I don't know where he is.

1041
01:35:10,288 --> 01:35:12,450
Goddamn it! Where are my keys?

1042
01:35:12,749 --> 01:35:14,911
I wanna know if youre
gonna see Bill tonight.

1043
01:35:19,005 --> 01:35:20,291
What are you asking me?

1044
01:35:21,216 --> 01:35:22,923
You know something that I don't?

1045
01:35:29,849 --> 01:35:30,805
Yeah?

1046
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:33,722
So, we working tonight, or what?

1047
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:37,764
Bill. I've been trying to
get a hold of you all day.

1048
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:39,640
I've been out.

1049
01:35:40,401 --> 01:35:41,562
Seen Ann?

1050
01:35:43,613 --> 01:35:45,445
No. No, I havent.

1051
01:35:46,699 --> 01:35:48,281
So what's the scoop? Are we on?

1052
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:51,531
Ted?

1053
01:35:54,666 --> 01:35:57,659
Yeah, fuckin A. Sure. Same place or...

1054
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:00,582
Okay. I'm on my way.

1055
01:36:10,723 --> 01:36:12,464
You're going to see him tonight.

1056
01:36:12,892 --> 01:36:15,350
Yeah, he's gonna drop me off at the airport.

1057
01:36:16,521 --> 01:36:18,057
I'll call you tomorrow.

1058
01:36:25,822 --> 01:36:27,108
Be careful.

1059
01:36:28,324 --> 01:36:29,565
You be careful.

1060
01:36:44,132 --> 01:36:45,248
He's a cop.

1061
01:37:40,063 --> 01:37:42,020
- You're right on time.
- Yep.

1062
01:37:49,030 --> 01:37:51,613
- Should we go pick ourselves out a car?
- Sure, why not?

1063
01:37:51,908 --> 01:37:54,275
- Wanna get a shopping bag?
- Fuck the shopping bag.

1064
01:37:55,286 --> 01:37:56,572
Fuck the shopping bag.

1065
01:37:57,038 --> 01:37:57,903
Come on.

1066
01:38:05,171 --> 01:38:06,582
Let's take the stairs.

1067
01:38:07,715 --> 01:38:08,671
Why not?

1068
01:38:13,971 --> 01:38:16,759
- So, hows your day been?
- Okay. How about yours?

1069
01:38:17,058 --> 01:38:18,344
Kind of bizarre.

1070
01:38:22,105 --> 01:38:24,597
- Saw a great 911 up there.
- Yeah?

1071
01:38:24,941 --> 01:38:27,228
Yeah, it's got one of those car phones in it.

1072
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:30,352
You like car phones, don't you?

1073
01:38:36,577 --> 01:38:38,489
- After you.
- You first.

1074
01:38:53,469 --> 01:38:55,802
You know,
you can't keep doing this forever.

1075
01:38:56,264 --> 01:38:57,755
What makes you think so?

1076
01:38:58,307 --> 01:38:59,798
You'll get caught, eventually.

1077
01:39:00,101 --> 01:39:01,137
You'll go away.

1078
01:39:01,436 --> 01:39:02,426
Wrong.

1079
01:39:03,062 --> 01:39:04,678
Law of averages.

1080
01:39:04,981 --> 01:39:06,017
Fuck averages.

1081
01:39:06,732 --> 01:39:09,475
I'm never going to jail,
I'll tell you that much.

1082
01:39:10,653 --> 01:39:11,643
Here she is.

1083
01:39:12,572 --> 01:39:14,279
What would you do to stay out?

1084
01:39:20,329 --> 01:39:21,490
I'd do what I had to.

1085
01:39:28,921 --> 01:39:30,162
No alarm.

1086
01:39:30,715 --> 01:39:33,002
Can't have more than 10,000 miles on it.

1087
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:35,717
You want to do the honors?

1088
01:39:37,805 --> 01:39:38,841
You're the expert.

1089
01:39:42,143 --> 01:39:44,760
What's the matter? Don't you trust me?

1090
01:39:45,104 --> 01:39:46,265
Should I?

1091
01:39:47,732 --> 01:39:50,190
I don't know.
You're the unknown here, Benjy. Not me.

1092
01:39:50,485 --> 01:39:51,475
I am?

1093
01:39:52,445 --> 01:39:53,856
Who the fuck are you?

1094
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:57,989
- You killed Bracey, didn't you?
- Look, I did what I had to, okay?

1095
01:39:58,284 --> 01:40:00,446
If we're all so corrupt,
why didn't you just buy him?

1096
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:02,407
I saved your life, man.

1097
01:40:02,705 --> 01:40:04,992
Did you? Or was Loos a setup for me?

1098
01:40:05,291 --> 01:40:06,998
Look, you're alive, right?

1099
01:40:07,335 --> 01:40:08,826
I fuckin trusted you!

1100
01:40:09,212 --> 01:40:10,202
Yeah.

1101
01:40:15,426 --> 01:40:16,712
We were friends.

1102
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:18,881
Yeah, we were.

1103
01:40:29,774 --> 01:40:33,188
You know, I keep thinking that
maybe we can get past all this.

1104
01:40:35,863 --> 01:40:40,028
- We cant, can we?
- Nope. I got to bust you.

1105
01:40:42,495 --> 01:40:44,862
- You're gonna bust me?
- Yeah.

1106
01:40:45,289 --> 01:40:46,325
No.

1107
01:40:48,251 --> 01:40:49,662
I'm gonna walk away now.

1108
01:40:51,003 --> 01:40:52,369
If you want to stop me...

1109
01:40:52,672 --> 01:40:53,958
shoot me in the back.

1110
01:41:00,137 --> 01:41:01,628
I'm not letting you go!

1111
01:41:05,518 --> 01:41:06,679
You can't kill me.

1112
01:41:14,569 --> 01:41:16,435
- Dont!
- Fuck you!
