1
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,580
They'd better not
push me on him,

2
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,080
or l'll just kick
them in the teeth on it.

3
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,460
Well, l think, if they...

4
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,680
Internal Revenue
people that are kicking

5
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,340
Billy Graham around
is Rosenberg.

6
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,220
He is to be out.

7
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,390
L don't give a goddamn
what the story is.

8
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,020
He went on television.

9
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,810
L have not. l've already
ordered Connally,

10
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,560
we're going
after the Chandlers,

11
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,730
every one individually,
collectively,

12
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,780
their income taxes
are starting this week.

13
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,570
Every one of those
sons of bitches.

14
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,740
Well, this is something that
we can really hang Teddy or...

15
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,790
Yeah.

16
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,160
Or the Kennedy clan with.

17
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,500
L'm gonna want to put that
in Colson's hands.

18
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,750
And we're gonna
want to run with it.

19
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,920
A controversial
day in politics.

20
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,380
A man arrested trying
to bug the offices

21
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,090
of the Democratic National
Committee in Washington

22
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,470
turns out to be an employee

23
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,640
of President Richard Nixon's
re-election campaign committee.

24
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,100
He is one of five persons
surprised and arrested yesterday

25
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,600
inside the headquarters of the
Democratic National Committee

26
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,900
in Washington.

27
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,440
And guess what else he is.

28
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,480
A consultant of
President Richard Nixon's

29
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,490
re-election
campaign committee.

30
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,570
The trial started today
at the federal courthouse

31
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,300
for the five burglars
caught breaking into

32
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,120
the Democratic National
Party headquarters.

33
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,280
Stand by for camera.

34
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,910
John Dean, the ex-White House
Counsel, testified today

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,040
that President Nixon knew
about the Watergate cover-up.

36
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,330
At one point in
the conversation,

37
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,840
l recall the President
telling me

38
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,340
to keep a good list of the
press people giving us trouble

39
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,720
because we will make life difficult
for them after the election.

40
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,550
Dean read through
a 245-page statement

41
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,180
characterizing a president
who was easily outraged

42
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,020
over war protesters
and political adversaries,

43
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,940
and outlining
a range of offenses,

44
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,770
including wiretapping
of newsmen,

45
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,980
a Charles Colson
plan to firebomb

46
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,110
and burglarize
the Brookings lnstitution,

47
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,150
and spying on Senator Kennedy
and other Democrats.

48
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,660
The misuse of power is the
very essence of tyranny.

49
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,780
And consider, if you will,

50
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,830
the frightening implications
of that for a free society.

51
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,000
The President today accepted the
resignation of three of his closest aides.

52
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,670
Out is H. R. Haldeman,
Chief of Staff.

53
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,260
Also quitting under fire
is John Ehrlichman.

54
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,590
Ehrlichman was
a key political advisor.

55
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,890
Good morning.
The Supreme Court

56
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,600
has just ruled on
the tapes controversy,

57
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,010
and here is Carl Stern,
who has that ruling.

58
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,390
Lt is a unanimous
decision, Doug, eight to zero.

59
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,770
Justice Rehnquist
took no part in the decision

60
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:15,690
ordering the President of the United
States to turn over the tapes.

61
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,150
Lt's an eight-to-zero
unanimous opinion.

62
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,950
A White House aide
told NBC News today

63
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,700
that impeachment
of the President

64
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,620
by the full House of Representatives
now is a virtual certainty.

65
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,370
These are,
with no serious doubt,

66
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,920
the last hours of the 37th
presidency of the United States.

67
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,380
This is indeed an historic day,

68
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,050
the only time a president has
ever resigned from office

69
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,800
in our nearly 200
years of history.

70
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,770
You see the White House
there, and in the White House,

71
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,180
in just a few moments now,

72
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,350
President Nixon will be
appearing before the people,

73
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,320
perhaps for the last time as
President of the United States.

74
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,900
15 seconds, Mr. President.

75
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,500
Okay, that's five,
four, three...

76
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:19,420
Good evening.
This is the 37th time

77
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,260
l have spoken to you
from this office

78
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,880
where so many decisions
have been made

79
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,470
that have shaped
the history of our nation.

80
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,550
L remember exactly where l was.

81
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,310
My father called. The phone rang,
my father called and he said,

82
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,650
"Turn on the TV right now.
Richard Nixon's going down."

83
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:41,440
l was at home with friends, and we
were watching television at home.

84
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,320
We stayed up and, like everyone
else, l'd been glued to

85
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,910
the Select and Judiciary Committee
hearings night after night.

86
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,120
And then finally,
it had come to this.

87
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,960
Therefore, l shall resign the
presidency effective at noon tomorrow.

88
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,040
But instead of the satisfaction
l imagined l'd feel,

89
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,380
l just got angrier and angrier,

90
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,210
because there was
no admission of guilt.

91
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,720
There was no apology.

92
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,170
Little did l know

93
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,390
that l would one day
be part of the team

94
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,850
that would try and
elicit that apology.

95
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,970
To leave office
before my term is completed

96
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,020
is abhorrent to every
instinct in my body.

97
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,600
L have never been a quitter.

98
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,320
And that that team would be led

99
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,110
by the most unlikely
of white knights,

100
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,110
a man with no political
convictions whatsoever,

101
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,410
a man who, as far as l know, had
never even voted once in his life.

102
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,370
But he was a man who had one big
advantage over the rest of us.

103
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,920
He understood television.

104
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:51,510
And now, the host of
Frost Over Australia,

105
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,260
Mr. David Frost!

106
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,100
Thank you, thank you.

107
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,520
Hello. Good evening.

108
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,690
And with the eyes of the world
focused on the White House,

109
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,400
here in Australia,
burglars have broken into

110
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,820
a meat factory in Brisbane

111
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,700
and stolen a ton
of pork sausages.

112
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:18,620
The Queensland police are looking for
men in a long, thin getaway car.

113
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,380
Now, my first guest tonight...

114
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,590
Well, we in the Nixon camp

115
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,130
really didn't know that much
about David Frost,

116
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,220
other than he was
a British talk show host

117
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,050
with something of
a playboy reputation.

118
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,850
He'd had a talk show here in the
US that had won some awards

119
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:40,020
but hadn't syndicated well and
had been dropped by the network.

120
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,560
He ended up taking
it down to Australia,

121
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:45,400
which is, l believe, where he was
when the President resigned.

122
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,150
Next week's guest
will be Evonne Goolagong.

123
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,150
We'll see you then.
God bless.

124
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,620
Great show, David.
Thanks, Noah.

125
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,910
Come and look at this.

126
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,150
Nixon leaving the White House.

127
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,910
A dark day for Richard
Nixon, who has drawn crowds

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,330
to the vast Ellipse south
of the White House before.

129
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,920
What, this is live?
Yeah.

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,670
- But those were triumphs.
- This is not.

131
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,260
What time is it in Washington?

132
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,760
9:00 a. m.

133
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,920
Why didn't he wait?

134
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,470
Lt's 6:00 in the morning
on the West Coast.

135
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,680
Half his audience
is still asleep.

136
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,020
All right, you blokes, let's
get the set broken down.

137
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,150
Are witnesses to the saddest
day in the life of Richard Nixon,

138
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:27,150
his last moments as President
of the United States,

139
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,860
a moment unlike any other in
the history of this country.

140
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,710
Richard Nixon, who goes now

141
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,050
from the power
of the presidency

142
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,340
to a form of exile
in California.

143
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,220
Find out the numbers for this, will you?
Worldwide.

144
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,610
L remember his face.

145
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,450
Staring out the window.

146
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:21,200
Down below him, a liberal
America cheered, gloated.

147
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,420
Hippies, draft dodgers,
dilettantes,

148
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,880
the same people who'd spit on me
when l got back from Vietnam.

149
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,090
They'd gotten rid of Richard
Nixon, their bogeyman.

150
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,770
So what's so important that it couldn't
wait, that it had to be today?

151
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,280
L've had an idea, John, rather
a bold idea for an interview.

152
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,820
Fish and chips, please.

153
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,280
And in a moment...

154
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,731
Well, it's too late now.
Lt's done.

155
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,120
L've called his people...

156
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,370
You?

157
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,790
Beans, peas and lamb, please.

158
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,330
And made an offer.

159
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:09,880
Now, if the subject
were to say yes,

160
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,260
well, he's rather a big fish that
swims in not-untricky waters.

161
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,510
So it goes without saying
that l'd want a dear friend

162
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,430
and the finest producer
l know by my side.

163
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,770
So who is it?

164
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,980
Richard Nixon.

165
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,700
Richard Nixon?

166
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,160
Well, come on,
don't look like that.

167
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,910
Well, how would you
expect me to look?

168
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,240
L spent yesterday evening watching
you interview the Bee Gees.

169
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,160
Weren't they terrific?

170
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,250
Come on, John, we've done
political interviews before.

171
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,000
So, okay, so what
kind of interview?

172
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:59,300
A full, extensive look-back
over his life, his presidency.

173
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,930
And?

174
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,430
And what?
Come on, David.

175
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,970
Surely the only thing
that would interest anyone

176
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,390
about Richard Nixon
would be a confession.

177
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,230
A full, no-holds-barred
confession.

178
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,520
Well, we'll get that, too.

179
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,610
From Richard Nixon?

180
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:12,980
Come on, John.

181
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,360
Just think of the
numbers it would get.

182
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,780
Do you know how
many people watched

183
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,450
his farewell speech
in the White House?

184
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,570
Four hundred million.

185
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,950
But in the end,
David heard nothing.

186
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,660
And soon after
arriving in California,

187
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,370
Nixon was rushed to hospital with
an acute attack of phlebitis.

188
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,220
L think it was around this
time that Gerald Ford,

189
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,350
who was the new President,

190
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,480
and who was desperate to move
the agenda on from Watergate,

191
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,650
gave Nixon a full,
free and absolute pardon.

192
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,440
Now therefore, I,
Gerald R. Ford,

193
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,150
President of the United States,

194
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,160
have granted, and by
these presents do grant,

195
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,780
a full,
free and absolute pardon

196
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:10,040
unto Richard Nixon for all offenses
against the United States.

197
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,500
Lt meant that the man who had
committed the greatest felony

198
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,250
in American political history
would never stand trial.

199
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,750
Lt was like he slipped
out the back door.

200
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,720
A public opinion poll indicates

201
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,180
a two-to-one disapproval of the
pardoning of Richard Nixon.

202
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,430
One telegram from Virginia said,
"Roosevelt had his New Deal,

203
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,100
"Truman had his Fair Deal, now
Ford has his crooked deal."

204
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,190
There was no deal, period.

205
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,610
L don't think the truth
will ever come out.

206
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,370
The American people
need to know the truth,

207
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,650
and l don't think it will
ever now be fully known.

208
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,590
So how do we want to address
the college protests?

209
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,890
Well, do we want
to lift some quotes

210
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,020
from the "stand up and be
counted" speech in 1970?

211
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,780
Sir? You know, maybe
we're just better off

212
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,390
using the whole
Lincoln Memorial memo.

213
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,900
Just include the whole thing.

214
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,440
Mr. President,
Swifty Lazar is here.

215
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,780
Okay. No, no, stick around.

216
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,070
You're gonna get
a kick out of this.

217
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,360
This is my literary agent
from Hollywood.

218
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,660
Hygiene obsessive.

219
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,080
Mr. President,
good to see you.

220
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,790
Nice to see you.

221
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,460
These are folks
helping me with my book.

222
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,420
Diane Sawyer, Frank
Gannon, lrving Lazar.

223
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,090
Nice to meet you.
Miss Sawyer.

224
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,880
Pleasure.
Mr. Gannon.

225
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,810
Okay, that's it.
L'll see you after lunch.

226
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,890
So how you feeling, sir?

227
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:57,850
L'm better, thank you. Though
not yet well enough to golf,

228
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,570
thank God.
L despise that game.

229
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,110
Lmagine, six weeks
out of office

230
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,700
as President
of the United States,

231
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,620
and they'd have me putting
in my hospital room.

232
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,700
Never retire, Mr. Lazar.

233
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:18,080
To me, the unhappiest people
of the world are retired.

234
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,960
No purpose.

235
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,800
What makes life mean
something is purpose.

236
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,760
A goal. A battle. A struggle.

237
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,050
Well, even if you don't win it.

238
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,050
When my doctor
declared me unfit

239
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,970
to give testimony
in the Watergate trial,

240
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,270
everybody thought
l'd be relieved.

241
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,940
Well, they were wrong.

242
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,520
That was the lowest l got.

243
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,020
Well, if it's a challenge you
want, here's one you might enjoy.

244
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:47,030
How to spend $2 million,
2.3 to be precise.

245
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,910
Lt's what l got
for your memoirs.

246
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,450
Well, thank you.

247
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,780
Eh...

248
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,620
lt might be a little short
of what l wanted,

249
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,250
but let me assure you, it's a
whole lot more than they wanted.

250
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,330
That book is important to me.

251
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,130
Lt's probably the only chance l'm
gonna get to put the record straight

252
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,590
and remind people the Nixon
years weren't all bad.

253
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,930
You know, if you're trying
to put the record straight,

254
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,470
l'd at least talk to him.

255
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,680
Who?

256
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,430
David Frost.
English talk show guy.

257
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,060
Why would l want to
talk to David Frost?

258
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,940
Well, a while back, he wrote
asking for an interview.

259
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,360
No.

260
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,740
Well, we didn't
get back to him.

261
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,150
Frankly, we didn't
find him appropriate.

262
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,990
Well, l thought that we
were doing one with CBS.

263
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,030
We are. l just figured
doing it with Frost

264
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,200
would be a whole lot easier than
doing it with Mike Wallace.

265
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:41,620
Lt would, but it would have a lot
less, you know, credibility.

266
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,250
True, true. Could
probably get more money.

267
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,800
Really?
Look.

268
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,260
We'll always have 350
on the table from CBS.

269
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,100
But if l could get Frost to pay
more and secure better terms,

270
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,680
it might be a shame to pass.

271
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:03,480
Lt'd be interesting to know
where he is right now.

272
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,480
We tied him to railway
tracks, and he escaped.

273
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,820
We buried him alive,
and he walked free.

274
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,280
Today we're lowering escape artist
Derek Harrison into the water

275
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:18,700
to see if he can miraculously
cheat death once more.

276
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,210
Good evening, and welcome
to Great Escapes.

277
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,210
My name is David Frost.

278
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,840
Okay, that is a cut.

279
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,000
Thank you.

280
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:31,380
Ln any deal, you need to know
your opponent's breaking point.

281
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,470
To assess that,
you might call them

282
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,800
late at night
or at the weekend.

283
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,270
Lf they take the call,
you know they're desperate.

284
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:43,770
And from that moment on, you
know you have the upper hand.

285
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,990
Hello?

286
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,780
Mr. Frost? lrving Lazar.

287
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,620
Who?

288
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,870
Swifty Lazar. l represent
President Nixon.

289
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,250
What time is it?

290
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,290
Bad time?

291
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,170
No! Not at all.

292
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,050
L'm calling with regard to
your request for an interview

293
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,140
and to say,
having considered it,

294
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,180
my client is not necessarily
opposed to the idea.

295
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,980
Really? Well, that's
terrific news!

296
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,820
For God's sake.

297
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,940
I got $500,000.

298
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,400
Ls that good?

299
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:37,120
Mr. President, it's a half a million
dollars for a news interview.

300
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,450
Lt's unprecedented.

301
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,700
Yeah? Well, what's the catch?

302
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,960
With Frost? None.
Lt'll be a big wet kiss.

303
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,170
This guy'll be so grateful
to be getting it at all,

304
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,920
he'll pitch puffballs all night

305
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,840
and pay a half a million
dollars for the privilege.

306
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,590
Well, you think
you could get 550?

307
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,220
L got 6.

308
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,770
David, how could you have done that?
What?

309
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,770
$600,000. That's a fortune.

310
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:06,850
200 on signature?

311
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,350
Don't worry about the money.

312
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,820
My God. Most Americans
think he belongs in jail.

313
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,570
You're making him a rich man.

314
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,570
Plus, by outbidding them,
you've already made enemies

315
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,150
of the networks.
They're just jealous.

316
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,740
They're already sounding off
about checkbook journalism.

317
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,240
And if the networks
are against you,

318
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,700
syndication's always
going to be a struggle.

319
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,370
No syndication,
no advance sales.

320
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,950
No advance sales,
no commercials.

321
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,460
No commercials, no revenue.

322
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,210
And here's the bigger question, why do it?
You don't need it.

323
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,450
Your career's in great shape.

324
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,630
This will just spread you
across three continents,

325
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,300
jeopardize the other shows.

326
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,760
Lsn't it true that
Channel Nine in Australia

327
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,550
want you to do another season
of your talk show for them?

328
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,680
Yes.
And London, too?

329
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,890
Yes, but that would be
London and Australia.

330
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,720
This would be...
What?

331
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,810
You wouldn't understand, John.

332
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,730
You were never part of
the show in New York,

333
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,150
but it's indescribable.

334
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:56,320
Success in America is unlike
success anywhere else.

335
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,780
And the emptiness
when it's gone.

336
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:06,620
And the sickening thought
that it may never come back.

337
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,920
You know, there's a restaurant
in New York called Sardi's.

338
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,750
Ordinary mortals
can't get a table.

339
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,500
John, the place was my canteen!

340
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,670
You know, l'd be happier

341
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,960
if l heard some kind of vision

342
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,290
that you had
for this interview.

343
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,420
Excuse me, Mr. Frost.

344
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,630
L'd heard you were
going to be here.

345
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,640
Would you mind?
Of course.

346
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,240
But l don't. l just
hear a man doing it

347
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,590
because it would
create headlines

348
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,720
or give him a place
at the top table.

349
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,140
And that is what
makes me nervous.

350
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,940
And you do nervous
so beautifully, John.

351
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,360
"Hello, good evening
and welcome."

352
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,450
L don't actually say that.

353
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,110
Hello, Mr. Frost.

354
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,910
Champagne?

355
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,710
No, thank you.

356
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,750
Another glass, sir?

357
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,440
You don't like champagne?

358
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,480
Not on airplanes.

359
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,860
Yes, it dehydrates
one terribly.

360
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,320
The trick is to have a glass
of water on the go, too.

361
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,950
Like the Viennese serve coffee.

362
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,290
Well, l've never
been to Vienna.

363
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,830
Oh. Well, you'd like it.

364
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,920
Lt's like Paris
without the French.

365
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,500
What's your name?

366
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,750
Caroline.

367
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,840
David.

368
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,630
Yes, l know. David Frost.

369
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,430
"Hello and good evening
and welcome."

370
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,850
You know, l heard an interview
with you recently on the radio.

371
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,270
You were giving it from the
back of your Rolls-Royce.

372
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,480
Bentley.

373
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,610
On the phone.

374
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,940
They said that
you were a person

375
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:04,030
who defined the age we live in.

376
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,740
Really?
Mmm.

377
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,870
You and Vidal Sassoon.

378
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,540
But what made you
exceptional, they said,

379
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,540
was that you were a person
who had achieved great fame

380
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,960
without possessing
any discernible quality.

381
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,260
How kind.
Mmm-hmm.

382
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,630
And that you fly
around a great deal.

383
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,010
Well, that's true.

384
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:28,890
Why?

385
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,470
L like to keep busy.

386
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,520
Why?

387
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,140
L find it more interesting
than keeping still.

388
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,150
You know,
you have very sad eyes.

389
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,650
Do l?
Mmm.

390
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,740
Has anyone told
you that before?

391
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,530
No.

392
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,280
Are you a sad person?

393
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,700
Let's talk about
you a little bit.

394
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,250
Of course, you feel more
comfortable asking questions.

395
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,290
How right you are!

396
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,340
This is your captain speaking.

397
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,420
You may have
noticed we've begun

398
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,630
our final descent
into Los Angeles.

399
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,590
Lf you could please return to your
seats and fasten your seat belts,

400
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,720
we'll be landing
very shortly. Thank you.

401
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,100
So how about you?
Where are you going?

402
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,520
To meet Richard Nixon.

403
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,850
Really?

404
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,310
You know, they say he has
the most enormous head,

405
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,320
but the sexiest voice.

406
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,780
Where is he now?

407
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,570
Ln some dark underground cave
licking his wounds?

408
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,200
Actually, no. ln his rather
smart beachside villa

409
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,330
in California.

410
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:34,120
Really? Richard Nixon
in a beachside villa?

411
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,790
How incongruous.

412
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,870
You can come if you'd like.

413
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,040
To meet Nixon?

414
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,460
Why not?

415
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,130
Are you sure?

416
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,840
You know, l would love that.

417
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:52,100
Cabin crew,
please prepare for arrival.

418
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,020
Well, l'll get my office to call
you first thing in the morning

419
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,640
and send a car with a phone.

420
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,730
Oh.

421
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,230
He did, too. Money no object.

422
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,320
Everything glittered
and was golden.

423
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,820
Well, on the outside.

424
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,740
Of course, what I didn't know
was that in the meantime,

425
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,990
he'd gone to all
the major networks

426
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,540
to try and get
interest in the interviews.

427
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,920
L'm sorry, David,
but we have a policy

428
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,420
of not paying
for a news interview.

429
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,670
Look, we love your work
as an entertainer.

430
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,840
That Guinness show?

431
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,430
Love it. You're a funny guy.

432
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,680
But an interview like this?

433
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,680
You're asking us to pay
a British talk show host

434
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,970
to interview
an American president

435
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,690
with absolutely no editorial
controls whatsoever in return?

436
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,730
Well, you can't say
it's not a fresh approach.

437
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,570
L know you're very busy.

438
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,610
L'm not gonna keep you from it.

439
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,860
Thank you for coming in.

440
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,030
L'm gonna have to
get back to you.

441
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,950
Okay, thank you so
much for your time.

442
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,080
David, good luck.

443
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,540
He never let on
to anyone at the time,

444
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,500
not even me. You know,
that would have meant...

445
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,710
Thanks.

446
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:04,340
Admitting failure,
and David doesn't do failure.

447
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,370
There you are.

448
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,950
See, you don't have
to do a thing yourself.

449
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,350
Well.

450
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,140
You found it okay.

451
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,350
Yes, thank you.

452
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,680
Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Frost.

453
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:05,770
And you, sir.

454
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,360
May l present Caroline Cushing?

455
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,480
Miss Cushing.

456
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,650
Hello. Your house
is very beautiful.

457
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,900
Really. Very romantic.

458
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,070
Well, thank you.

459
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,950
And my producer, John Birt.

460
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,570
Nice to meet you.
How do you do?

461
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:20,080
This is Mr. Lazar,
and this is Jack Brennan.

462
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,460
Now, Miss Cushing, would
you like to take a tour,

463
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,830
you know, maybe stretch your
legs after your long journey?

464
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,590
Yes, please.
L'd love that. Thank you.

465
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,670
Come on in.
This is my office.

466
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,880
Now, this is where Brezhnev
and l had our summit.

467
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:39,350
Yeah. Brezhnev was there, and
Gromyko there, Dobrynin there.

468
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,520
We talked for
nine hours straight.

469
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:48,190
After the meeting,
as a souvenir of the visit,

470
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:52,530
l remember that we had
a Lincoln specially made.

471
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,820
Dark blue,
cherry wood, leather.

472
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:58,530
Well, we got inside
for the photographers,

473
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:02,870
when the next thing you know,
he steps on the gas.

474
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:07,670
Now, the first rule
of political life is

475
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:12,170
you never let a president get
behind the wheel of a car, ever.

476
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,260
L mean, we're not
used to doing anything

477
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,300
for ourselves, let alone drive.

478
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,550
And the Chairman, Jesus,
the way he put his foot down,

479
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,390
my guess is
the last thing he drove was

480
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:25,520
a tractor on some
Ukrainian potato farm.

481
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,980
He crashed into curbs.

482
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,520
He went over speed bumps.

483
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,530
He went twice
around my whole estate.

484
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:38,360
Finally, we ended up at some
remote point on the coast,

485
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:41,370
out there overlooking the sea.

486
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:45,660
He turns off the gas,
and he talks for two hours

487
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:49,210
about his favorite subject,
steel mills.

488
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:52,040
He said, "Mr. President,
most politicians

489
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,800
"have tragedy
in their early lives."

490
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,890
Well, l told him that l lost
two brothers to tuberculosis.

491
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:04,970
And he watched his father die from the
cancer he caught in the steelworks.

492
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:10,270
He was a sad man
and a noble adversary.

493
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,320
L wouldn't want to
be a Russian leader.

494
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,150
They never know when
they're being taped.

495
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,580
Okay, l guess that's
it then, huh?

496
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,450
Until March.
L look forward to it.

497
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,410
Well, thank you,
Mr. President. So do l.

498
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,080
You know,
it's a funny thing that

499
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:32,880
l've never been
challenged to a duel before.

500
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,210
L guess that's what this is.

501
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,210
Yeah, well, not really.

502
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,880
Of course it is.

503
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,680
And l like that.

504
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,930
No holds barred, eh?
No holds barred.

505
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:55,980
Mr. Frost, there's still
the small matter of the...

506
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,740
Of course.

507
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,660
L do beg your pardon.

508
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,210
Right. $200,000.

509
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:21,470
L do hope that isn't coming
out of your own pocket.

510
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:24,640
Well, believe me, sir, l wish
my pockets were that deep.

511
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,310
Made out in the name of?

512
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,520
Lrving Paul Lazar.

513
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,430
Richard M. Nixon.

514
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,570
Here you go.

515
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,740
Okay, smile.

516
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,370
There. Now you can put that in
your apartment in New York,

517
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,000
and all your liberal friends
can use it as a dartboard.

518
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,790
Well, actually, l'm living in
Monte Carlo at the moment.

519
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,250
Really?

520
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,170
Yes. Goodbye, Mr. President.

521
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,630
Hey. Take my advice.

522
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,260
You should marry that woman.

523
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,560
Yes. Lovely, isn't she?

524
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,600
More important than that,
she comes from Monaco.

525
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,730
They pay no taxes there.

526
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,940
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.

527
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,070
L bet you it did.

528
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,200
What?

529
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,660
Come out of his own pocket.

530
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,870
You know, he couldn't
look me in the eye.

531
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,540
Well, l hear the
networks aren't biting.

532
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,710
Without the networks, the ad
agencies don't want to know.

533
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,040
So if you ask me,
there's a good chance

534
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,250
this whole thing
may never happen.

535
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:43,550
Really? So that meeting we just
had might have cost him $200,000?

536
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,720
Correct.

537
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:49,050
Had l known that, l would have
offered him a cup of tea.

538
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,890
Say, did you notice his shoes?

539
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,020
No.

540
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,600
Ltalian. No laces.
What do you think?

541
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,770
My people tried to get me
to wear a pair like that.

542
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,440
L think a man's shoes
should have laces, sir.

543
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,650
You do?

544
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,320
Yeah. Personally, l find those
ltalian shoes very effeminate.

545
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,450
Yes, quite right.

546
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,410
I'm sorry,
David, but it's a no.

547
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,250
Try to look at it
from our point of view.

548
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:20,250
Why would an American network
hire a total outsider,

549
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,590
and someone who's already had his
own show canceled, incidentally?

550
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,170
L see. Well, l'm sorry
you feel this way.

551
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,140
Obviously, l think you're
making a terrible mistake.

552
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,100
N BC.

553
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,600
Well, that's the networks
out, all of them.

554
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,270
Well, that's the
end of that, then.

555
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,240
L'm sorry, David.

556
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,700
Not so fast.

557
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,620
Where's your
adventurer's spirit?

558
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,660
The idea is
we pay for the program

559
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:01,790
and syndicate it ourselves,
completely bypassing the networks.

560
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,460
Just imagine it, we'd be our
own network for the night.

561
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,420
- Hey, Bob.
- How does that grab you?

562
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,340
Hey, come on in.
David's on the phone.

563
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,260
No, never been done before.

564
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,930
Historic stuff.

565
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:18,390
Just think about it, okay?
And call me back.

566
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,520
Yeah?
Yeah.

567
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,650
David, l'd like you to meet
Jim Reston and Bob Zelnick,

568
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,970
our two prospective corner men.

569
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,070
Delighted to meet you.

570
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,950
Come on in.
Make yourselves at home.

571
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,391
Bob's been
Washington correspondent

572
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,700
for Public Radio
for the past 10 years.

573
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,990
Moving to ABC in the new year.

574
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,370
The general feeling, David,

575
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:38,250
is that l have been wasting my
matinee idol looks on radio.

576
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,920
Jim here teaches at the
University of North Carolina

577
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,800
and is writing a book about the
criminal dishonesty, corruption,

578
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,920
paranoia and abuses of
power of Richard Nixon.

579
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,470
Second on the subject.

580
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,590
Fourth.

581
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,720
Well, delighted to
have you both aboard.

582
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,220
Actually, before l sign on,
l would like to hear

583
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:58,180
what you were hoping to
achieve with this interview.

584
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,770
What l want to achieve?

585
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,100
Yeah.

586
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:06,280
Jim, well,
l've secured 12 taping days.

587
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,280
That's close to 30 hours

588
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,530
with the most compelling
and controversial politician

589
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,360
of our times.

590
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,950
Lsn't that enough?

591
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,160
Well, not for me.

592
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,830
Look, l'd be giving up a year of my life.
L'm leaving my family

593
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,540
to work on a subject
matter that means more

594
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,340
than you can probably imagine,

595
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,580
and the idea of doing all that

596
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:31,010
without achieving what
l want to, personally,

597
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,800
would be unthinkable to me.

598
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,140
No, all right.

599
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:37,600
Well, what is it that
you want to achieve?

600
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:46,190
L'd like to give Richard Nixon
the trial he never had.

601
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:49,530
Of course, we'll be asking
difficult questions.

602
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,280
Difficult questions.

603
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,410
The man lost 21,000 Americans

604
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,910
and a million lndo-Chinese
during his administration.

605
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,750
He only escaped jail
because of Ford's pardon.

606
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:03,120
Yes, but equally, going after
him in some knee-jerk way,

607
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:06,750
you know, assuming
he's a terrible guy,

608
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,510
wouldn't that only create more
sympathy for him than anything else?

609
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,050
You know...

610
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,050
Right now,
l submit it's impossible

611
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,600
to feel anything close to
sympathy for Richard Nixon.

612
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,810
He devalued the presidency,

613
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:25,520
and he left the country
that elected him in trauma.

614
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:30,320
The American people need a
conviction, pure and simple.

615
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,110
The integrity of
our political system,

616
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,990
of democracy as an idea,
entirely depends on it.

617
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,370
And if in years to come,
people look back

618
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:42,830
and say it was
in this interview

619
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,500
that Richard Nixon
exonerated himself,

620
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,790
that would be
the worst crime of all.

621
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:59,550
Did you know that Mike Wallace
is doing a piece on this?

622
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,180
And that in the bars around
Capitol Hill and Georgetown

623
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,020
this entire project is a joke?

624
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,770
Come on.
Jim, come on.

625
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,190
Thanks for that, Jim.

626
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,570
Could you give us
a couple of minutes?

627
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,290
You're unbelievable.
L'm sorry, Bob.

628
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,580
You know, Jim, l went way
out on a limb for you.

629
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,310
L mean, some of us
actually want this job.

630
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,830
L want it, too,
if it's done right.

631
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,670
Well, how do you know they're
not gonna do it right?

632
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,000
Little Lord Fauntleroy
in there?

633
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,260
Sympathy for Richard Nixon?

634
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,970
What the...
He's full of shit, man!

635
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,590
How do you know that?

636
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,760
Ls Mike Wallace
doing a piece on this?

637
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,020
Apparently.

638
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,770
Why didn't you tell me?

639
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,890
Lt isn't relevant.

640
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:52,730
What's the angle?
"British talk show host,

641
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,240
"good with actresses, not so good
with stonewalling presidents."

642
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,320
That's the general idea, yeah.

643
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,620
Right.

644
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:04,580
Lt's hard not to feel
a little insulted by that.

645
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,710
Well, Bob's obviously a pro.

646
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,000
What are we gonna
do about Reston?

647
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,630
Well, the man's an idiot.
He's overemotional.

648
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,960
Send him home.

649
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,340
Well, l think he should stay.
Why?

650
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,720
L liked his passion.

651
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,800
He will drive us
all bloody mad.

652
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,060
Well, maybe, but sometimes
being out of your comfort zone

653
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,810
is a good thing, l'm told.

654
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,100
He stays.

655
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,830
L took my seat next to
Mrs. Mao at the banquet table.

656
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:50,170
Now, one of the challenges
of life as a president

657
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:57,800
is the endless round of cocktail
parties, social engagements, banquets.

658
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,510
And people who
know me would tell you

659
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:04,850
that small talk is not one of
my strong suits, either. No.

660
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,600
Particularly not in Mandarin.

661
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,610
So Mrs. Mao and I, we just, well,
you know, stared at one another.

662
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:22,030
And then across the table, Mrs. Nixon
and Chairman Mao himself, well,

663
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,240
they stared
at one another, too.

664
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:28,160
And then further down,
Dr. Kissinger

665
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:31,080
and their
foreign minister, well,

666
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,630
you're getting the picture now.

667
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,260
L can't stand it, Jack!

668
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:47,720
Reducing the presidency to a
series of banal anecdotes.

669
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:50,730
L feel like a circus
animal doing tricks.

670
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,690
And l thought l made it clear!

671
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:57,320
L didn't want to take any
questions on Watergate, damn it!

672
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:01,110
Soon as it came
to question time,

673
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,820
all those sons of bitches ever
want to hear about is Watergate!

674
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:10,370
Lt's as if all my other
achievements have ceased to exist.

675
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,710
Well, sir, you're
gonna get a chance

676
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,080
to talk about them
sooner than you think.

677
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,830
Yeah? How?

678
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,290
Frost got there.
He got the money.

679
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,010
What?

680
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,510
L understand
most of it's borrowed,

681
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,340
that his friends
have bailed him out.

682
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,640
But the point is, we start
taping at the end of March.

683
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,430
Really? Now, that's terrific.

684
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,270
How much time is
devoted to Watergate?

685
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:33,190
25%. Just one of
four 90-minute shows.

686
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:35,270
What are the other
three divided into?

687
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,360
Domestic Affairs,
Foreign Policy,

688
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,520
and Nixon the Man.

689
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:39,570
"Nixon the Man"?

690
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:41,820
As opposed to what?
Nixon the horse?

691
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,070
Well, l imagine it's some
kind of biographical piece.

692
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:50,990
L can see it now. The father that
neglected me, the brothers that died.

693
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,120
Spare me.

694
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:58,250
Still, now, the fact it's come together,
now, that's a good thing, no?

695
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:01,550
Mr. President, it's fantastic.

696
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,920
Frost is just not in
your intellectual class, sir.

697
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:07,470
You're gonna be able to dictate
terms, rebuild your reputation.

698
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:12,470
Lf this went well, if enough people
saw it, revised their opinion,

699
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,810
you could move back East way,
way earlier than we expected.

700
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,770
You think?
L'm certain.

701
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:25,360
Lt would be so good to go
back to where the action is.

702
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,740
You know?

703
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:30,330
The hunger in my belly
is still there, Jack.

704
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,330
L guess it all boils down
to Watergate, huh?

705
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,080
Well, that's nothing
to worry about, sir.

706
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:41,880
Lt's not as if there's
gonna be any revelations.

707
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,670
That stuff's been combed over
a million times.

708
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,050
No one has pinned
anything on you.

709
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,590
Yeah, still, it's been a while

710
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,180
since l spoke about it
on the record.

711
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,010
L'm gonna start
doing my homework.

712
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,850
Hey, you know what would be an
interesting thing to find out?

713
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,020
What his strategy is.

714
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,140
Now, where's he staying?

715
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,770
L believe The Beverly Hilton.

716
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,360
The Beverly Hilton, you say.

717
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,860
Well, l got
the numbers someplace

718
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,320
of some fellows
that we could send in.

719
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,030
Cubans with ClA training.

720
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,420
Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.

721
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,340
Yes, sir.

722
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,170
A week later, we said
goodbye to our families,

723
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:31,340
we hopped on a plane, and we
moved into The Beverly Hilton.

724
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,470
And that's where we started
to dig into our research

725
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:36,060
and prepare for the interviews.

726
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,180
Yeah, as it happens, we took

727
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,440
the whole question
of security very seriously.

728
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,230
And from day one, we kept all
our files in a locked safe.

729
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:53,160
Who was the guy that Mike interviewed?
Was that Haldeman?

730
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,870
Haldeman. Haldeman.
And Ehrlichman, too.

731
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:57,450
L always get
the Germans mixed up.

732
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,120
L'm a little confused by that.

733
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,960
What is Haldeman's official...
Hello, darling.

734
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:06,710
As for the work over the months,
we divided it into three sections.

735
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,340
Birt took Vietnam, Bob took
Foreign and Domestic Policy,

736
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:13,600
and l got Watergate
and the abuses of power.

737
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,560
And David, we never
really saw much of David.

738
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,140
All right, so what
about the Huston Plan?

739
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,020
You can see the seeds
of dirty tricks.

740
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,520
Essentially, it's an attempt
to legalize dirty tricks.

741
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,690
That's why you gotta get David
to put it in the question.

742
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,860
Wiretapping students.

743
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,360
But they've
traced the money to him.

744
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,990
Opening people's mail.

745
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,070
What about wiretapping?

746
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,160
How many people
has he wiretapped?

747
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,490
This guy wiretapped 17 people.

748
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,620
Seventeen?

749
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,740
Lncluding his own brother.

750
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,700
But you know what? We can't
ask him about his brother,

751
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:41,540
'cause frankly, if Donald
Nixon was my brother,

752
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,750
l'd wiretap him, too.

753
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,130
But wait, okay, so we have
breaking and entering.

754
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,840
We have wiretapping, conspiracy
to foster prostitution.

755
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,180
And that's Liddy, right?

756
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,510
Delivery courtesy
of Nate 'n Al's

757
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,310
finest deli selection.

758
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,890
We're going to need napkins.
We'd better have some napkins.

759
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,850
How do we frame a question
about Cambodia,

760
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,940
about the illicit
bombing of Cambodia?

761
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,020
L think you should say,

762
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,730
"How far do you take
executive privilege

763
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,460
"before it becomes
an undemocratic event?"

764
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,780
l think you frame the
question to him as a Quaker.

765
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:13,570
"How do you feel as a Quaker about
annihilating an entire people?"

766
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,660
Come on. Are they really
interested in buying time?

767
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,330
Are they going to
give us the money?

768
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:22,910
How serious are they?

769
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,500
You have to set up that he has
an anti-democratic personality.

770
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,270
There's a reason they
call him Tricky Dick.

771
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,840
Because l had written about
and watched Nixon for years,

772
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,050
l got to play him
in our rehearsals.

773
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,180
You know, the fellas would
throw me a question,

774
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:39,140
and l would try and anticipate
what his response might be.

775
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,270
Okay, the White House
taping system.

776
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:44,640
Ours is not the first administration
to use taping systems.

777
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,560
Lyndon Johnson's White House used them.
So did Kennedy's.

778
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:49,270
Huston Plan. Wiretapping and
alleged abuses of power.

779
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,190
Let me tell you, other administrations
were up to far worse.

780
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:56,610
And just for fun, your
close friend Jack Kennedy.

781
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,870
That man, he screwed
anything that moved,

782
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,620
fixed elections
and took us into Vietnam.

783
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,000
And the American people,
they loved him for it!

784
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,000
Whereas l,
Richard Milhous Nixon,

785
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:12,010
worked around the clock in their
service, and they hated me!

786
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:16,430
Look. Look. Now l'm sweating.

787
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,930
Damn it! Damn it!

788
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:22,100
And Kennedy's so goddamn
handsome and blue-eyed!

789
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,640
And women all over him!

790
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:26,020
He screwed anything
that moved, and everything.

791
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,350
Had a go at Checkers once.

792
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,860
The poor little bitch
was never the same!

793
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:35,610
Gentlemen, finally a friend
in the American press.

794
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,320
Jack Anderson
in The Washington Post,

795
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:40,780
"When Richard Nixon faces
the television cameras

796
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:43,620
"for his first interview since
he abandoned the White House,

797
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,080
"he'll be cross-examined as if
he were on the witness stand.

798
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:50,380
"Frost has hired
three crack investigators

799
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,130
"to help him with the research.

800
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:55,420
"Clearly the famous TV interviewer
will pull no punches."

801
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:56,930
"Crack investigators"?

802
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,050
Can l be Crack One?

803
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,590
Can l be Deep Crack?

804
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,640
David, can l talk
to you for a sec?

805
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,100
After researching my last book,

806
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,520
l was pretty certain Colson...

807
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,850
You know, Charles Colson?
His darkest henchman?

808
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,781
Colson, right. Colson had
a meeting with Nixon

809
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,570
Sometime before June 23,

810
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:14,070
but l never knew
the exact date,

811
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,860
so l couldn't
find the transcript.

812
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,110
But if you gave me a week back in
the Federal Courthouse library...

813
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,870
A week? Goodness, Jim, we
can't lose you for that long.

814
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,330
L think this is
really good stuff, Dave.

815
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,370
Would there be something
l could help you with?

816
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:27,870
You know, if we're gonna nail
Nixon in these interviews,

817
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,370
we're gonna have to ambush him.

818
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,790
We're gonna have to
take him by surprise.

819
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,040
Don't worry, Jim.
We'll get him anyway.

820
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:35,710
Hang on a second.
David, Jack Brennan.

821
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,260
He sounds a little emotional.

822
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,800
L'll take it in here.

823
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,800
He'll be right
with you. Yeah.

824
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:45,600
Jack.
Watergate.

825
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,770
Yes, Jack.

826
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:50,440
Our lawyers want us to agree
on a definition of the word.

827
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,400
Well, l believe
it's a large hotel

828
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,570
and office complex
in Washington, Jack.

829
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:55,730
You know what
l'm talking about.

830
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,280
For the interviews.

831
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:59,400
We want to propose
that Watergate

832
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:01,990
be an umbrella term
for everything negative.

833
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:05,290
Hold on a minute.

834
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:11,960
So all the other
domestic charges

835
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,480
against him,
the Brookings lnstitute,

836
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,590
the Plumbers Union,
the Enemies List,

837
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:18,170
you're saying all that
goes into Watergate?

838
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,510
Correct.

839
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:23,090
That is absurd
and a clear breach

840
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,180
of the terms of our agreement.

841
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,310
Okay. How would
you define Watergate?

842
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:29,630
Well, that it covers just that.

843
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,440
The Watergate
break-in of June 17th

844
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,810
and the subsequent
cover-up and investigation.

845
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,610
Fine. ln which case,
the deal is off.

846
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:39,190
Fine. ln which case,
you can expect a lawsuit

847
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,450
for something
in excess of $20 million

848
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:43,570
in damages and
loss of earnings.

849
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:46,490
The terms of the contract
clearly stipulate

850
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:50,200
that Watergate take up
no more than 25% of the time.

851
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:53,170
Yes, but nowhere does it say
that for the rest of the 75%

852
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,750
he gets to drone on
and sound presidential.

853
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:01,590
"Drone on"? Jesus Christ.
Where's your respect?

854
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,470
You remember who you're
talking about here.

855
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:08,260
You know as well as l do that 60%
of what he did in office was right,

856
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:12,190
and 30% may have been wrong, but he
thought it was right at the time.

857
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:14,190
Yes, but that still leaves 10%

858
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:16,690
where he was doing
the wrong thing and knew it.

859
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:21,530
You goddamn media people.
You are so smug.

860
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,780
Well, l can guarantee you
if you screw us on the 60%,

861
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:29,410
l will ruin you if it takes
the rest of my life.

862
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:32,750
Prick.

863
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,940
Look at you. Gorgeous.

864
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,610
Good night, sweet princes.

865
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:59,320
Cheerio.
Bye.

866
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,610
See you in the morning.

867
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:06,240
Why the monkey suit?

868
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,280
David has a film premiere
he needs to attend.

869
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,870
What? The night
before we start taping?

870
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:12,620
What's the movie?

871
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,580
It's The Slipper and the Rose.

872
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,130
The Cinderella movie?

873
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:21,420
Yeah. David's
the executive producer.

874
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,050
You don't think it might be
an idea for our interviewer

875
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:26,380
to be rested and focused
on the job in hand?

876
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:28,090
Don't worry.

877
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:30,600
David is a performer
of the highest caliber.

878
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,140
He's been in these pressure
situations many times before.

879
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:36,440
Come the hour,
he'll be fine. Okay?

880
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,740
What did he say?
Did he say "performer"?

881
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,610
Yeah.
That's the word he used?

882
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:46,900
Yeah, he said "performer."

883
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:48,110
Not "journalist"
or "interviewer"?

884
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,280
No. He said "performer."

885
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:55,500
Out of curiosity, where are you
at this moment? Psychically?

886
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:02,300
L am imagining the dust,
the darkness,

887
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:05,920
the agony and the
unimaginable loneliness

888
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:09,090
of the wilderness l am
about to be dispatched to

889
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,930
by my Washington
political colleagues.

890
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,900
So any opportunity you get, go right
to foreign policy, go right to Mao,

891
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:27,200
go right to Khrushchev.

892
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,450
Just go right!

893
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:30,280
You could do all day
on foreign policy, sir.

894
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,950
L disagree that the Mao
banquet story is stale.

895
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:33,530
Excuse me, sir. Something
l think you should see.

896
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,660
People love that story.

897
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:35,790
Why don't we
save it for the book?

898
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:37,870
Yeah, right, come on.

899
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,630
- David.
- Mr. Frost.

900
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:43,750
David, some people in the
media have suggested

901
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,590
that you're not
the right man for the job,

902
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:47,380
that you'll be
too soft on the President.

903
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:49,300
What will you do
if he stonewalls you?

904
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,090
Well, I shall
say so again and again.

905
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,640
But l should say right now
that l'm not expecting

906
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,600
his approach
to be to stonewall.

907
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,310
L'm hoping that it'll be
that of a cascade of candor.

908
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,060
"A cascade of candor"?

909
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,770
From Richard Nixon?

910
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,860
You think that's
what you'll get?

911
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:09,200
No, l just thought it was a
phrase that might appeal to you.

912
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,820
So what about the money?

913
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:12,620
That's a strange fellow.

914
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,660
Started life as a comic,
you know.

915
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:15,870
Ls that so?
Mmm-hmm.

916
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:17,830
Almost married Diahann Carroll.

917
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:18,870
Who?

918
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,710
The singer.

919
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:23,750
Lsn't she black?

920
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:26,550
Yes, sir.

921
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:30,130
Right here in the Frost
file, which we put together

922
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,840
as part of
our general preparations.

923
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:36,510
Okay. Let's get back to work.

924
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,850
That's fact, this is fiction.

925
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:40,690
So now it's about
The Slipper and the Rose.

926
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,100
Lt's a cracker of a movie.

927
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:44,060
L hope you'll all
come and see it, and...

928
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:53,280
L shouldn't have
ordered that coffee.

929
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,070
Just don't drink any more.

930
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:02,620
Good luck.
Thank you.

931
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,880
L'll be thinking of you.

932
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,300
Dick. Wait.

933
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:31,570
For the record, l'm gonna be
starting with John's idea.

934
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:33,400
"Why didn't you
burn the tapes?"

935
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:34,740
No.
Fuck.

936
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:37,530
Please, God, no! You can't.

937
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:40,240
David, you can't do that.
Lt would be a disaster.

938
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:43,410
Lt would get us into Watergate
way ahead of the agreed time.

939
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,170
What is the point of
having contractually set

940
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:48,420
specific times to deal
with certain subjects

941
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,130
if you're just going to
ignore it right off the bat?

942
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:51,420
'Cause it's war, isn't it?
Gloves off.

943
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:52,720
L like it. lt's ballsy.

944
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,010
Strategically,
it'll give us the upper hand.

945
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:56,140
Lt's insanely risky.

946
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,640
He could walk
right off the set,

947
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,100
and there's nothing
we could do about it.

948
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:00,930
Worse, he could sue you!

949
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,680
We were sadly unable to do
the taping at Casa Pacifica

950
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:06,060
because of the Coast Guard
radio interference,

951
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:09,150
so we ended up at the rather
more modest Smith house,

952
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:11,730
which was owned by a local
Republican businessman.

953
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,450
Right here!

954
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:15,740
Mr. Frost, look over here.

955
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,030
Over here, sir!

956
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,280
Here we go. Back up
behind the curb.

957
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:19,490
A few questions, please.

958
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:20,660
Right here, Mr. Frost.

959
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:23,040
David!
David! David!

960
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:29,880
Well, hello there.

961
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:35,420
Excuse me, fellas.

962
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:53,780
Nixon, there's
blood on your hands!

963
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:55,320
Liar!

964
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:06,790
Here comes the President!

965
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,170
Mr. President!

966
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:10,000
Mr. President!

967
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,130
How are you
feeling, Mr. President?

968
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:17,680
The Smith family requested that the
furniture be put back in place.

969
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,390
They talked to you
about that, too?

970
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:21,260
They're bugging everybody.

971
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:28,020
You know, l've written
four books about him,

972
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,770
but this is the first time l've
actually seen him in the flesh.

973
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,940
He's taller than l imagined,
and tanned.

974
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,320
The least he could
do is look ravaged.

975
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:40,030
You gonna shake his hand?

976
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,280
Am l gonna shake...

977
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:42,660
Are you kidding me?

978
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,370
After everything that prick's
done to this country?

979
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:45,750
L'm not gonna shake his hand.

980
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:47,370
Gentlemen.

981
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:51,750
May l present Bob Zelnick,
my executive editor?

982
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,170
How do you do?

983
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,550
Pleasure, Mr. President.

984
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:57,420
And Jim Reston,
one of my researchers.

985
00:50:57,510 --> 00:50:59,760
Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Reston.

986
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,560
Mr. President.

987
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,310
Excuse me, sir? Got a
room for you right here.

988
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:15,020
Wow. That was
devastating, withering.

989
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:16,570
L mean, l don't think he's
ever gonna get over that.

990
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:17,860
Yeah, fuck off.

991
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:22,240
L got you guys
set up back here.

992
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:26,240
Now this is your green room.

993
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:28,790
And the President will be
on the large monitor.

994
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:30,580
Craft services is that way.

995
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:40,820
Keep it about
that temperature, okay?

996
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,880
Mr. President?

997
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:42,970
Yeah.

998
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:44,430
Before we start,
l just want to say

999
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:47,600
how delighted we all are
by Mrs. Nixon's recovery.

1000
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,560
Well, thank you.
Lt's true.

1001
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,600
She's much better now.

1002
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:56,230
She's just getting round to the
business of replying to all the cards.

1003
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,530
And from our
point of view, well,

1004
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:02,280
l'd just like to say
how pleased we are

1005
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,780
that you got this all together.

1006
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:04,910
Thank you.

1007
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:08,120
As l understand it,
it's been quite a struggle.

1008
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,250
Well...

1009
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:11,500
How much has it cost?

1010
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:14,920
You mind me asking?
Hey, come on.

1011
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,590
Come on, it's just between us.

1012
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:20,550
Very well. Two million.

1013
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:24,220
Two million? Jeez. l didn't
realize we were making Ben-Hur.

1014
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:29,560
But tell me something.

1015
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,930
You raised it all now?

1016
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:37,060
Not quite.
But we're getting there.

1017
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:39,650
Everyone's been kind
and deferred fees.

1018
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:42,740
Well, not quite everyone.

1019
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:45,570
David, l'm gonna go in
with you on camera.

1020
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,320
Excuse me.

1021
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:49,580
L want to put a handkerchief
here, if l may.

1022
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:51,500
Ls that out of shot?

1023
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,330
That's fine, Mr. President.

1024
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,670
Contractually,
l think that we made

1025
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:59,000
an agreement that
after each question

1026
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:01,670
l might dab my upper lip
before answering it.

1027
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,680
Which you won't show, you know,
when you cut it together.

1028
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,260
You're probably aware of my
history with perspiration.

1029
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:11,600
Lf you're referring to your TV
debate with Jack Kennedy in 1960.

1030
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:16,440
They say that moisture on my upper
lip cost me the presidency.

1031
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:20,650
People who heard it on the radio,
well, they thought l'd won.

1032
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:23,190
But television
and the close-up,

1033
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,740
they create their
own sets of meanings.

1034
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:29,030
So now they insist
l bring a handkerchief

1035
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,200
and that l have
my eyebrows trimmed.

1036
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:33,040
Sixty seconds, everyone.

1037
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,210
You trim yours?
No.

1038
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:38,040
No, of course not.

1039
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:40,540
Yeah, you're light-skinned.
Yeah.

1040
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:44,470
You got blue eyes. You've got no
troubles with perspiration, l imagine.

1041
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:46,510
No, not that l'm aware.

1042
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:49,010
You were obviously
born to be on the tube.

1043
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:53,310
Stand by
to roll tape in 30 seconds.

1044
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:55,480
Settling.

1045
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,820
Those shoes.

1046
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,280
They're ltalian, aren't they?

1047
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:08,200
My shoes? l believe so.

1048
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:10,950
Yeah, that's interesting.

1049
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,370
You don't find
them too effeminate?

1050
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,540
No.

1051
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:23,420
Well, l guess
somebody in your field

1052
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,340
can get away
with them, you know.

1053
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,010
Manolo, just check
my collar, will you?

1054
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:28,760
David,
starting with camera two,

1055
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:35,220
in four, three, two.
Cue David. And...

1056
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:42,060
Mr. President. Now, we're going
to be covering a lot of subjects

1057
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:45,530
in a great deal of detail over
the course of these interviews,

1058
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:49,490
but l'd like to begin
completely out of context

1059
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:51,200
by asking you one question,

1060
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,200
more than any other,
almost every American

1061
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:57,450
and people all over
the world want me to ask.

1062
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:01,420
Why didn't you burn the tapes?

1063
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:06,460
Son of a bitch!

1064
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:15,220
Well, Mr. Frost, l'm
surprised by your question

1065
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:20,390
since we have an agreement, a
contractual agreement, l believe,

1066
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,730
that we would cover Watergate
in our last taping session.

1067
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:38,500
But if your viewers really
do have a major concern,

1068
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:43,630
then perhaps l should
briefly respond to it now.

1069
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:46,840
What probably very
few people realize

1070
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,130
is that the taping system
in the White House

1071
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,470
was set up by my predecessor,
President Johnson,

1072
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:56,680
partly to avoid the necessity of
having a secretary in every meeting,

1073
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,270
and partly to ensure there was

1074
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:01,850
a record kept of
every verbal agreement,

1075
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:04,900
no matter how
off the cuff or casual.

1076
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:08,150
Now, initially, on coming
into the White House,

1077
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:11,030
l insisted on
dismantling the system.

1078
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:14,410
L hadn't liked the idea at
all, but the former President,

1079
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:16,740
President Johnson,
had repeatedly said

1080
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:20,080
how crazy it would be
to remove the system,

1081
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,750
which he felt
was the best way...

1082
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:24,150
Well, in boxing, you know, there's
always that first moment,

1083
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:26,290
and you see it in
the challenger's face.

1084
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:28,500
Lt's that moment that he feels

1085
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:30,920
the impact from
the champ's first jab.

1086
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:35,010
Lt's kind of a sickening
moment, when he realizes that

1087
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:38,390
all those months
of pep talks and the hype,

1088
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:41,600
the psyching yourself up,
had been delusional all along.

1089
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,640
You could see it
in Frost's face.

1090
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:45,900
Lf he didn't know
the caliber of the man

1091
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,110
that he was up against
before the interview started,

1092
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:50,750
he certainly knew it halfway through
the President's first answer.

1093
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:53,610
You see,
since the best advice is

1094
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:57,280
almost always
of the confidential variety,

1095
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:59,540
now the tapes have
been made public,

1096
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:02,080
people are unlikely
ever to feel comfortable

1097
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,750
speaking in confidence
at the White House.

1098
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:08,630
They're less likely to offer that advice.
So in the end,

1099
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:10,920
it's the whole
political system and,

1100
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,920
by implication, it's
the country that suffers.

1101
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:16,050
So much for
our "ballsy" opening.

1102
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:22,020
So when did you
actually decide...

1103
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:25,020
At what moment did you know
you were going to resign?

1104
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,060
That's good. That's good.

1105
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:32,360
L remember exactly.
Lt was July 23.

1106
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,280
After it was clear
the Southern Democrats

1107
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,880
that were still against
impeachment had

1108
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:39,990
had the screws put on them
by the Speaker of the House.

1109
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:47,420
That night l said to Al Haig, "Well, that's it.
There goes the presidency."

1110
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:49,420
And, of course,
you know, being Al,

1111
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,040
he tried to talk me out of it.

1112
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:53,880
And Vice President Ford,
l mean, let's not forget

1113
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:57,550
he had the most to gain
personally from my stepping down,

1114
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,470
he was still
absolutely convinced that

1115
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:01,310
we were gonna win
the impeachment vote,

1116
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:03,140
and comfortably.
John, we have to do something.

1117
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:04,301
We have to move this along.

1118
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:05,980
This is desperate, John.
Do something.

1119
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:08,480
Twenty-three minutes
on one question?

1120
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,610
Okay, let's take a break.

1121
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:11,020
Let's change the tapes.
Come on, man.

1122
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:12,320
Stop tape.

1123
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,150
L'm sorry, gentlemen.

1124
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,860
We have to take a break.
Tape change.

1125
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:19,740
Oh. Okay, how's that?
You getting what you need?

1126
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:21,070
Lt's fantastic.

1127
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,740
Good. Good. Thank you.

1128
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:25,500
Excuse me. One moment, sir.

1129
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:27,660
Yeah, sure.
Take your time.

1130
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,000
What are you doing, David?
You've got to stop him rambling.

1131
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:32,250
Lt's all right. These are
just introductory exchanges.

1132
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,820
But this session
only lasts two hours.

1133
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,561
Nearly half of it's gone, and we're
wasting valuable material, okay?

1134
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:38,880
The moment that he made
the decision to resign,

1135
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:40,260
we should be scoring
points with that stuff.

1136
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,510
Want me to switch to Vietnam?

1137
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,060
No. No. We've got
to get something

1138
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,850
out of that resignation night.
All right?

1139
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:48,520
That was Nixon at his lowest point,
a total wreck. On his knees?

1140
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,060
Praying with Kissinger? Come on,
you can nail him with that stuff.

1141
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:52,520
Listen, was that okay?

1142
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:53,860
Perfect, sir.

1143
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:56,610
Lt didn't sound too
arrogant or self-serving?

1144
00:58:56,690 --> 00:59:00,200
Not at all. You sounded controlled,
even-handed, statesmanlike.

1145
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,450
Good.

1146
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:02,700
Now continue
exactly the same way.

1147
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:04,660
Long answers.
Control the space.

1148
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:05,700
Don't let him in.

1149
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:07,080
Okay, got you.

1150
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:12,330
Set. And roll.

1151
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:22,260
We're coming back on camera three
in four, three, two and...

1152
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:28,730
Reading the account of those
extraordinary final days,

1153
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:31,270
it seems your most
emotional moment came

1154
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:34,690
in that heart-to-heart you
had with Henry Kissinger.

1155
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:38,400
Was that perhaps the most
emotional moment of your career?

1156
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:40,490
- Good, good.
- Yes.

1157
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:46,490
L would say it was about as emotional
a moment as l've ever had.

1158
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:50,790
Except, well, you know,
it's hard to say

1159
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:52,960
what is the most
emotional moment,

1160
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,670
because each is different.

1161
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:59,170
L remember the day
Eisenhower died.

1162
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:00,550
For God's sake.

1163
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:04,890
And the day l walked my eldest
daughter Tricia down the aisle.

1164
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:07,640
And the day during
the impeachment hearings

1165
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:11,350
when Julie, that's my youngest,
she came into my office,

1166
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:15,940
she threw her arms around me, she kissed me.
She cried, you know?

1167
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:18,900
And she so seldom cries.

1168
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:21,450
She said, "Daddy, you're
the finest man l know."

1169
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:23,530
"Daddy, you're
the finest man l know"?

1170
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:27,490
"And whatever you do,
l will support you.

1171
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:32,870
"You just gotta go through the
fire, you know, a little longer."

1172
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:37,000
This is beautiful.

1173
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:40,260
So Kissinger and l were
in the Lincoln Sitting Room,

1174
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:43,300
and together we began
to reminisce

1175
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:47,220
about some of the great decisions
that we'd participated in.

1176
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:50,470
There was China,
the Soviet Union,

1177
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:53,100
the peace settlement
in Vietnam.

1178
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:57,190
Now, let me tell you something
that l never told anybody.

1179
01:00:57,270 --> 01:01:01,740
Whenever l have had a really
tough decision to make...

1180
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:04,820
Now, we were in the Lincoln
Sitting Room at that time.

1181
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:08,580
L have come into this room
for the purpose of praying.

1182
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:13,500
"Now, Henry, l'm a Quaker.
You're a Jew.

1183
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:15,500
"Neither of us is
particularly orthodox,

1184
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:18,630
"but l'd like to think that
each of us in our own way

1185
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:21,670
"has a deep
religious sensitivity.

1186
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:26,840
"So if you don't mind, could we just
have a moment of silent prayer?"

1187
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:31,180
So we knelt down. Now, this was
in front of that table where

1188
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:35,390
Lincoln signed the
Emancipation Proclamation.

1189
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,940
And then after a few moments, we
both got up again, and Henry says...

1190
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,610
ls there... l'm sorry.

1191
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:41,860
Ls there a problem?

1192
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:42,980
That's time.

1193
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:45,700
We're over two hours.

1194
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:47,860
Really? So soon?

1195
01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:51,540
Well, Mr. President,
l gather our time is up.

1196
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:53,540
Gee, now, that's a pity.

1197
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:56,120
You know, l was beginning
to enjoy that.

1198
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:02,420
That was terrific, both of you.

1199
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:03,880
We're getting some
great material.

1200
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,300
You know, it's so funny, too,

1201
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:08,800
because l was expecting
questions on Vietnam.

1202
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:11,390
And we prepared for that,
hadn't we, Jack?

1203
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:12,850
Yes, so did l.

1204
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:16,060
L guess we just got caught
up, you know, reminiscing.

1205
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:17,140
Lndeed.

1206
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:19,480
So, day after tomorrow,
10:00, right?

1207
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:20,650
Yes, indeed.

1208
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:22,440
L look forward to it.
Bye-bye.

1209
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:31,990
There's no need
to say anything.

1210
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:40,670
- Mr. President!
- Mr. President!

1211
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,010
Mr. President!

1212
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:46,420
Mr. President, please!

1213
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,630
What are you gonna tell him?

1214
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,430
L'm gonna tell him
he's gotta get involved.

1215
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:52,300
He's gotta be able to shut him up.
Shh.

1216
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:55,430
David, we have some fundamental problems
in our approach that l think...

1217
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,890
Don't worry, Bob.
L'm on it.

1218
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:57,980
We can use some of
the Kissinger stuff.

1219
01:02:58,060 --> 01:02:59,770
Yeah, but we need to discuss
it sooner rather than later...

1220
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:01,230
Look, l'm disappointed, too.

1221
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:04,020
But l wonder, could we possibly
spare the post-mortem for now?

1222
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:06,150
L don't mean to minimize it. lt's
just l've got to get back to LA

1223
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,640
to meet some people
from Weed Eater.

1224
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,530
Thanks, everyone!
Great work!

1225
01:03:09,610 --> 01:03:11,780
Marv, Lloyd, great day.
Bye, David.

1226
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:14,740
L'll see you soon.
God bless!

1227
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:20,210
What the hell is Weed Eater?

1228
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,710
Lt's a horticultural mechanism.

1229
01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:23,790
One of our sponsors.

1230
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:25,250
What happened to Xerox?

1231
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:27,590
What about General
Motors or lBM?

1232
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:30,720
L gather that not all of the
blue-chip accounts came through.

1233
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,970
We do have Alpo.

1234
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:34,470
Dog food?

1235
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,890
Wait, John.
We're already taping.

1236
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:39,100
So we're close, right?
We're very close?

1237
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,600
That's probably a question
you should ask David.

1238
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:42,560
Are we close, John?

1239
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,570
L believe we're at 30%.

1240
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:49,820
To go? Or 30% sold?

1241
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:52,570
Again, that's probably
a question you should...

1242
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:55,240
Sold, 30% sold.

1243
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:57,490
Jesus...

1244
01:03:57,620 --> 01:03:59,160
l thought we were
practically fully financed.

1245
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:02,370
We were. But the financing was always
conditional on advertising sales,

1246
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:04,170
and no one predicted that
they'd fall apart like this.

1247
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:06,130
Well, why have they fallen apart?
Based on what?

1248
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:09,010
Credibility of the project. What
else are advertising sales based on?

1249
01:04:09,090 --> 01:04:11,220
Listen,
l understand your concern.

1250
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:14,510
But could l ask you to go a little easier
on David over the next couple of days,

1251
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:17,010
bearing in mind the extraordinary
pressure that he's under?

1252
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:20,600
'Cause at the moment, he's effectively
paying for all this himself.

1253
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:24,350
So he's in it for a lot more
than just his reputation.

1254
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:25,980
And we're not?

1255
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:36,660
You seemed
very confident last time.

1256
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:39,660
L don't understand. Why this
sudden change of heart?

1257
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,290
All right, this is just madness.
Lt's Richard Nixon.

1258
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:46,590
These interviews will do mid-30s
audience share, minimum.

1259
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:53,300
Jimmy! Yes. Yes, back again,
like the proverbial bad penny.

1260
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:54,930
Look, l hate to do
this to a friend,

1261
01:04:55,010 --> 01:04:58,220
and l know you're already in
for more than l asked for,

1262
01:04:58,310 --> 01:05:01,770
but l need you to dig
a little deeper.

1263
01:05:03,310 --> 01:05:05,480
L'm right up against it now.

1264
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:12,240
So, l had a chance to
review yesterday's tapes.

1265
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,530
And?

1266
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:17,620
Honestly?
Far too soft, David.

1267
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:19,780
Go on. Beat me, John.
Beat me with a stick.

1268
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:22,870
Look. No, l'm serious.

1269
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,330
You have got to make it
more uncomfortable for him.

1270
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:28,130
You can start by sitting forward.
You've gotta attack more.

1271
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:29,790
Lf he starts tailing off, bang,

1272
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,250
jump in with another question.

1273
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:33,380
Don't trade generalizations.

1274
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:34,470
Be specific.

1275
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:37,640
And above all, don't let him give these
self-serving, 23-minute homilies.

1276
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:38,841
Right.
And keep your distance

1277
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:40,100
before the tape starts running.

1278
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:41,460
He was toying
with you yesterday.

1279
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,770
All that shit about Ben-Hur and
struggling to raise the money.

1280
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:47,940
Those are mind games.
Don't engage.

1281
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:51,480
Never forget, you are in
there with a major operator.

1282
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:54,110
Got it.

1283
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:02,410
Ah.

1284
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:05,210
The Grand lnquisitor!

1285
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:08,790
No, just your friendly
neighborhood confidant.

1286
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:15,760
Lt's okay.
We just blew a bulb.

1287
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:19,010
This is why l got all these
Secret Service guys around.

1288
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,470
There's nothing to worry about.

1289
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:23,890
As a president, you get
used to this kind of stuff.

1290
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:27,560
Ed, we gotta get in here and
change out this 750, ASAP.

1291
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:34,690
Focus, sir.
Yeah.

1292
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:40,910
Okay, we are back. Okay,
take it on my count.

1293
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:44,660
Okay, stand by to roll tape.
30 seconds.

1294
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:46,160
Settling.

1295
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:47,910
You have a pleasant
evening last night?

1296
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,580
Yes, thank you.

1297
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:00,050
Did you do any fornicating?

1298
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:03,350
David, we're starting
with camera two in four,

1299
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:06,680
Three, two and...

1300
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:14,520
Mr. President, you came to
office promising peace,

1301
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:16,570
but no sooner did you get
into the White House

1302
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:21,070
than US involvement in Vietnam
deepened and the war was prolonged

1303
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:22,740
with calamitous consequences.

1304
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:26,290
Did you feel that you'd betrayed
the people that had elected you?

1305
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:30,120
Well, Vietnam was not my war.

1306
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:31,880
Lt was my inheritance.

1307
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:33,790
And it looked to me...
Jump in.

1308
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:36,880
As if the reason
for our being there

1309
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:41,680
had perhaps not been adequately
understood by the American people.

1310
01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:44,100
Lt seemed to me
they hadn't realized

1311
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:49,390
how important a test this was
of American credibility.

1312
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:52,100
The whole world
was watching to see

1313
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:55,230
if we have the character
to see it through.

1314
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:58,070
Now, look, l could have bugged out.
L could have.

1315
01:07:58,150 --> 01:08:00,780
L could have blamed it
on my predecessors.

1316
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:03,360
L could have pulled the
troops out of Vietnam early,

1317
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:05,740
and very possibly,
l would have won

1318
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:09,080
some Scandinavian peace prize
into the bargain.

1319
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,790
But l believed in the cause.

1320
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:16,210
And sometimes, you know, what you
believe in, it's the harder path.

1321
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:21,090
You might even say that l was the
last casualty of the Vietnam War.

1322
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:23,970
Yeah, tell that
to the paraplegics.

1323
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:25,390
Come on, David, Cambodia.

1324
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:28,600
And Cambodia? An invasion which
everybody advised you against.

1325
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:31,730
All the ClA and Pentagon intelligence
suggested it would fail.

1326
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:32,890
So why did you do it?

1327
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:34,020
Well, first of all,

1328
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:40,530
as a result of our incursion into
Cambodia, we picked up 22,000 rifles,

1329
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:45,120
15 million rounds of ammunition,
150,000 rockets, mortars.

1330
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,410
That's all belonging
to the North Vietnamese,

1331
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:50,500
which would only otherwise
have been directed

1332
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:52,710
right onto American soldiers.

1333
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:56,040
But one of the principal justifications
you gave for the incursion

1334
01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:57,790
was the supposed existence of

1335
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:02,760
the "headquarters of the entire Communist
military operation in South Vietnam,"

1336
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:06,590
a sort of "bamboo Pentagon" which
proved not to exist at all.

1337
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,300
No, no. Wait a minute there. No, l was...
And by sending...

1338
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:11,640
And by sending B-52s
to carpet bomb a country,

1339
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:14,270
wiping out
whole civilian areas,

1340
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:17,360
you end up radicalizing
a once moderate people,

1341
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:20,070
uniting them in
anti-American sentiment

1342
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:22,780
and creating a monster
in the Khmer Rouge

1343
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:24,150
that would lead to civil war...

1344
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:25,910
All right!
...and genocide.

1345
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:27,490
Yes, good, good, good.
There it is.

1346
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,740
Okay, run VT.

1347
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:29,830
Roll tape.

1348
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:27,710
Well, sir,
l'm sure you'd agree,

1349
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,800
some pretty
stirring images there.

1350
01:10:29,890 --> 01:10:35,640
Look, it was never US policy to kill civilians.
That's the enemy's way.

1351
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:36,730
Well, l'm not suggesting...

1352
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:37,850
And if you're
asking the question

1353
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:42,020
do l regret the casualties on both sides
in the war, yeah, sure, of course l do.

1354
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:44,190
Let me tell you something.
Lt can just wear you down.

1355
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,150
Well, all right, sir, when you
are faced with someone who...

1356
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:48,280
But whenever
l have had my doubts,

1357
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,490
l remembered the construction
worker in Philadelphia,

1358
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:51,780
because he came up to me

1359
01:10:51,870 --> 01:10:55,410
and he said, "Sir, l got only one
criticism of that Cambodia thing.

1360
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,250
"lf you'd gone in earlier,

1361
01:10:57,330 --> 01:10:59,080
"you might have
captured the gun

1362
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:01,170
"that killed my boy
three months ago."

1363
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:04,250
So you're asking me, do l
regret going into Cambodia?

1364
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:06,590
No! l don't.
You know what?

1365
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:09,720
L wish l'd gone in
sooner and harder.

1366
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:10,840
Got him.
Safe!

1367
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:22,190
Lt was horrifying. lt was horrifying.
And he was so confident.

1368
01:11:25,190 --> 01:11:27,650
What are you gonna say
about Watergate?

1369
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:31,280
Sorry, boys, just all
talked out, you know?

1370
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,410
Better?

1371
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,130
Lt was.
Unquestionably better.

1372
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:51,800
What's next?

1373
01:11:52,430 --> 01:11:53,680
Foreign policy.

1374
01:11:56,220 --> 01:12:01,270
Great. Russia, China,
the big power stuff.

1375
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:03,650
Yeah, so?

1376
01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:05,480
So if he beats him up
like that on Vietnam,

1377
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:08,440
imagine what he's gonna do
with his real achievements.

1378
01:12:11,070 --> 01:12:13,410
Lt ain't gonna be pretty.

1379
01:12:13,490 --> 01:12:16,200
The answer was
grow by six inches.

1380
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:19,160
Lt was agony to watch.

1381
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:22,830
Now, that's when Khrushchev called
me, begging me to intervene.

1382
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,960
You see, he and Mao
didn't get along,

1383
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,340
and Khrushchev
knew that the Chairman

1384
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:29,420
would talk to me, no one else.

1385
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:34,260
You see, l was the only one that Mao
would trust personally, man-to-man.

1386
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,850
When David tried to
lay a finger on him,

1387
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:39,310
Nixon made mincemeat
out of him.

1388
01:12:40,270 --> 01:12:41,980
What "revolution," David?

1389
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:43,850
You just let
Richard Nixon claim

1390
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:46,150
the country was in
a state of revolution?

1391
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:49,480
What, with protestors "bombing"
and "assaulting" police officers?

1392
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:50,780
That's not how l remember it.

1393
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:53,780
What l remember is people protesting
peacefully and legitimately

1394
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:55,030
against the Vietnam War!

1395
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,660
That's what l remember.
Music off, please. Off.

1396
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:59,461
By the end, wiretapping students and
breaking into journalists' homes

1397
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,700
was beginning to sound
like a rational response.

1398
01:13:01,790 --> 01:13:03,160
Well, l'm sorry
you feel this way,

1399
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:05,330
but l simply cannot
share your view.

1400
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:06,500
About what exactly?

1401
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:07,920
About any of it, frankly!

1402
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,630
L thought today was
a huge improvement.

1403
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:11,710
Are you nuts?

1404
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,800
Let me tell you how
bad things were today.

1405
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:16,890
After the taping finished, l overheard
two members of the crew say

1406
01:13:16,970 --> 01:13:19,350
they never voted for him
when they had the chance,

1407
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:22,810
but if he ran for office again
today, he'd get their support.

1408
01:13:22,890 --> 01:13:25,600
You're making him look
presidential, for Christ's sake!

1409
01:13:25,690 --> 01:13:28,230
And forget about
the trivia, David.

1410
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,150
Who cares whether Nixon took
the White House bed to Europe

1411
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,070
when he traveled?
L do!

1412
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:34,780
Well, it's irrelevant!

1413
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:38,570
And it's just the sort of banal
anecdote that would distract a talk...

1414
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:41,160
A what?

1415
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,000
Go on. No, say it.

1416
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,580
What, you were gonna
say "talk show host"?

1417
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,340
Yeah. Yeah, l was.

1418
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:04,480
All right, look, it's useless me
trying to answer your points.

1419
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:08,600
Frankly, l don't share any of
your sense of pessimism or alarm.

1420
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:13,440
And this ridiculous
self-flagellation,

1421
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:16,030
in my view, is just depressing.

1422
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:18,200
No!

1423
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:24,540
And threatening to derail
the whole enterprise.

1424
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:31,340
Look. lf there is anyone here
who thinks we're gonna fail,

1425
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:34,340
they better leave now,

1426
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:37,630
or it'll infect everyone else.

1427
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,020
No one?

1428
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:50,860
Right.

1429
01:14:52,230 --> 01:14:53,360
Good.

1430
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:59,610
Now, l suggest instead of festering
around the hotel for the next five days,

1431
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:02,660
we all go our separate
ways over Easter.

1432
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:06,830
But before we go, Caroline
and l would like you

1433
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:09,330
to join us for a little
celebratory dinner

1434
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:12,460
at Patrick Terrail's new place.

1435
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:15,300
Celebrate?
Celebrate what, David?

1436
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:17,130
The fact that we're all gonna
be working at Burger King?

1437
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:20,430
What are we celebrating?
Lt's my birthday, Bob!

1438
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:30,440
L'd like to celebrate my
birthday with a few friends.

1439
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:43,620
Look, is that Neil Diamond?

1440
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:45,580
Frost and Nixon,
Frost and Nixon

1441
01:15:45,660 --> 01:15:46,990
And is that Sammy Cahn?

1442
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:48,200
Go together like
Prancer and Vixen

1443
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:49,620
David, did you hear that?

1444
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:51,420
Soaring through the airwaves

1445
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:53,790
Jesus, that's Hugh Hefner.

1446
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:54,880
Oh, my God.

1447
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,210
Hoping for several
hefty paydays

1448
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:57,710
Yeah, l think it is.
With Michael York.

1449
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,050
That's gotta be Bunnies.

1450
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:00,770
Those are Bunnies?
Those are real Bunnies?

1451
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,220
Frost and Nixon,
Frost and Nixon

1452
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:03,430
Go together
like Mason and Dixon

1453
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:07,010
David, just putting it all together it's
the most extraordinary accomplishment.

1454
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:08,640
Frost lines up with Dicky...

1455
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:10,010
No one else
could have done that.

1456
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:12,781
And these interviews are always gonna
be around for future generations

1457
01:16:12,810 --> 01:16:15,110
of academics and
political historians.

1458
01:16:15,190 --> 01:16:16,190
That bad?

1459
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,980
He saved it

1460
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:21,200
He wrote a book
Now here's the hook

1461
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,780
David!

1462
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:23,910
Patrick.

1463
01:16:23,990 --> 01:16:26,950
He's not a crook
He's paid by David

1464
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:13,620
My, what a festive atmosphere.
Please, don't get up.

1465
01:17:13,710 --> 01:17:17,290
L take it from this that the
interviews have gone well?

1466
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:19,050
Better than that, ma'am.
Lt's a shutout.

1467
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:21,300
The President's sitting
on an 11 - 0 lead.

1468
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:23,420
Really? Well.
Yeah.

1469
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:25,720
Well, that is most gratifying.

1470
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:33,230
L'm so glad it's all
gone according to plan.

1471
01:17:48,490 --> 01:17:49,780
L see.

1472
01:17:51,450 --> 01:17:53,500
Ls there nothing we can do?

1473
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,290
Really?

1474
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:01,630
Right. Well, thanks
for letting me know.

1475
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:11,680
Lt's true. They've dropped
the Australian show.

1476
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:14,060
Oh, no, David.

1477
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:17,940
They felt that l needed
to reevaluate my priorities.

1478
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:23,360
Now my producer's worried that
the London show will follow.

1479
01:18:26,610 --> 01:18:28,010
L'm in this
for everything l've got,

1480
01:18:28,030 --> 01:18:31,740
and there's still no guarantee
it'll ever see the light of day.

1481
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:38,370
What have l done? What was l thinking?
Why didn't anyone stop me?

1482
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:40,080
They should have
physically stopped me!

1483
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:41,790
No, no, no. Shh.

1484
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:53,180
Look, we don't have to go out tonight.
Why don't we stay in?

1485
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:56,350
Hmm?

1486
01:19:00,650 --> 01:19:04,070
L'll go down to Trader Vic's
and bring something back.

1487
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:07,360
Steak or fish?

1488
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:10,200
David?

1489
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:17,040
Don't worry. l'll call
from the restaurant.

1490
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:06,170
L'll have a cheeseburger.

1491
01:20:06,590 --> 01:20:10,840
Mmm. That sounds good.
L used to love cheeseburgers,

1492
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:14,050
but Dr. Lundgren
made me give them up.

1493
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:17,680
He switched me to cottage
cheese and pineapple instead.

1494
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:21,060
He calls them
my Hawaiian burgers,

1495
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,520
but they don't taste
like burgers at all.

1496
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:25,770
They taste like Styrofoam.

1497
01:20:29,570 --> 01:20:31,450
L hope l'm not disturbing.

1498
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:33,660
No.

1499
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:35,370
Lt's a Friday night.

1500
01:20:35,450 --> 01:20:40,000
You've probably got somebody
there whom you're entertaining.

1501
01:20:41,410 --> 01:20:42,670
No.

1502
01:20:42,790 --> 01:20:44,500
Well, then what are you doing?

1503
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:47,210
A handsome young fellow,

1504
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:52,800
an eligible young bachelor
alone on a Friday night.

1505
01:20:54,470 --> 01:20:59,930
Lf you must know, l'm preparing
for our final session.

1506
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:02,980
The all-important
final session.

1507
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:05,190
Yes.
Watergate.

1508
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:09,400
'Cause I guess the way you handle
Watergate's gonna determine

1509
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:12,780
whether these interviews
are a success or a failure.

1510
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:16,910
Should l be nervous?

1511
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:22,790
Well, l'm gonna
give it my best shot.

1512
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:28,170
Quite right. No holds barred.
No holds barred.

1513
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:30,960
You know, it's strange.

1514
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:35,300
Now, we have sat in chairs
opposite one another,

1515
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:38,640
talking for hours,
it seems, days on end,

1516
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:41,930
and yet l've hardly
gotten to know you.

1517
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:46,060
One of my people,
as part of the preparation

1518
01:21:46,150 --> 01:21:48,810
for this interview,
she did a profile on you.

1519
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:53,400
And l'm sorry to say that l just
got around to reading it tonight.

1520
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:59,120
There's some interesting
stuff in there.

1521
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:02,290
Your Methodist background,
the modest circumstances,

1522
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:08,710
and then you're off to a grand
university full of richer, posher types.

1523
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:11,300
What was it? Oxford?

1524
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:14,130
Cambridge.

1525
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:19,260
Did the snobs there
look down on you, too?

1526
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:25,180
Of course they did. That's our
tragedy, isn't it, Mr. Frost?

1527
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:31,270
No matter how high we get,
they still look down at us.

1528
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:34,320
L really don't know
what you're talking about.

1529
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,070
Yes, you do.

1530
01:22:36,610 --> 01:22:40,490
Now, come on.
No matter how many awards

1531
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:43,790
or column inches
are written about you

1532
01:22:43,870 --> 01:22:48,460
or how high the elected office is
for me, it's still not enough.

1533
01:22:49,330 --> 01:22:51,590
We still feel
like the little man,

1534
01:22:51,670 --> 01:22:56,420
the loser they told us
we were a hundred times.

1535
01:22:57,090 --> 01:23:01,800
The smart-asses at college,
the high-ups, the well-born,

1536
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:07,140
the people whose respect we
really wanted, really craved.

1537
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:13,690
And isn't that why we work so hard
now, why we fight for every inch,

1538
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:17,440
scrambling our way up
in undignified fashion?

1539
01:23:17,530 --> 01:23:22,620
Lf we're honest for a minute, if we
reflect privately just for a moment,

1540
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:29,670
if we allow ourselves a glimpse into
that shadowy place we call our soul,

1541
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:34,590
isn't that why we're here now?
The two of us?

1542
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:38,420
Looking for a way
back into the sun,

1543
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:43,260
into the limelight,
back onto the winner's podium.

1544
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:46,890
Because we could feel
it slipping away.

1545
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:49,940
We were headed,
both of us, for the dirt!

1546
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:54,480
A place the snobs always
told us that we'd end up.

1547
01:23:54,570 --> 01:23:55,690
Face in the dust.

1548
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:59,860
Humiliated all the more for
having tried so pitifully hard.

1549
01:23:59,950 --> 01:24:02,360
Well, to hell with that!

1550
01:24:02,450 --> 01:24:04,660
We're not gonna let that
happen, either of us.

1551
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:06,410
We're gonna show those bums.

1552
01:24:06,490 --> 01:24:10,040
We're gonna make them choke
on our continued success,

1553
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:15,750
our continued headlines, our continued
awards and power and glory!

1554
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:19,880
We are gonna make
those motherfuckers choke!

1555
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:32,480
Am l right?

1556
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:37,650
You are.
Except only one of us can win.

1557
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:39,820
Yes.

1558
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:48,040
And l shall be
your fiercest adversary.

1559
01:24:48,620 --> 01:24:52,710
L shall come at you
with everything l got,

1560
01:24:53,670 --> 01:25:00,260
because the limelight
can only shine on one of us.

1561
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:06,180
And for the other,
it'll be the wilderness,

1562
01:25:08,010 --> 01:25:13,230
with nothing and no one
for company

1563
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:18,520
but those voices
ringing in our head.

1564
01:25:33,290 --> 01:25:38,250
You can probably tell
l've had a drink.

1565
01:25:40,130 --> 01:25:42,510
Lt's not too many.
Just one or two.

1566
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:47,090
But you believe me,

1567
01:25:49,430 --> 01:25:56,230
when the time comes, l'm gonna
be focused and ready for battle.

1568
01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:02,440
Good night, Mr. Frost.

1569
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:05,780
Good night,

1570
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:09,320
Mr. President.

1571
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:29,470
So with or without cheese?
L brought burgers.

1572
01:26:30,430 --> 01:26:31,510
David?

1573
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:32,760
L've got to work.

1574
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:38,690
Well,
who was the asshole that did?

1575
01:26:39,650 --> 01:26:41,440
Jesus, is that Liddy?

1576
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:43,860
He must be a little nuts.

1577
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:45,190
Yeah, he is.

1578
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:47,860
I mean, he just isn't
well screwed on, is he?

1579
01:26:47,950 --> 01:26:49,870
Lsn't that the problem?

1580
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:52,450
Yeah, screw the Cabinet
and the rest of those.

1581
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:56,040
But no more sucking around.
From now on, they come to me.

1582
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:58,170
There is one thing
that I want done,

1583
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:00,250
and l don't want
any argument about it.

1584
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:04,210
L want you to direct the
most trusted person you have

1585
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:05,960
in the Immigration Service

1586
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:10,140
that they are to look over all the
activities at the Los Angeles Times.

1587
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:13,890
All, underlined. And they are
to send their teams in to see

1588
01:27:13,970 --> 01:27:16,890
whether they are violating
the wetback thing.

1589
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:18,640
- ls that clear?
- Yes, sir.

1590
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:24,610
You open that scab, there's a
hell of a lot of things that

1591
01:27:24,690 --> 01:27:27,070
we just feel that
it would be very detrimental

1592
01:27:27,150 --> 01:27:29,400
to have this thing
go any further.

1593
01:27:36,410 --> 01:27:37,410
Hello?

1594
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:39,000
Jim, it's David.

1595
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:42,250
Hey. What time is it?

1596
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:45,340
How much longer are you
gonna be in D.C. for?

1597
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:46,800
Tuesday. Till Tuesday.

1598
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,970
Great. Well, you
remember you mentioned

1599
01:27:49,050 --> 01:27:51,510
going to the Federal
Courthouse library?

1600
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,970
Honey, can you
check on him, please?

1601
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:55,850
Yes, for the Colson stuff?

1602
01:27:55,930 --> 01:27:59,140
Well, l've been doing a little
light reading this end,

1603
01:28:00,270 --> 01:28:02,940
and you remember that hunch
you had about the meeting

1604
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:04,560
between Nixon and Colson?

1605
01:28:04,650 --> 01:28:06,360
Uh-huh. What are you thinking?

1606
01:28:35,350 --> 01:28:36,810
Hey.
Hey.

1607
01:28:36,890 --> 01:28:37,970
Good morning.

1608
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:39,060
And?

1609
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:52,950
Excuse me, sir.

1610
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:11,720
Lt's 8:30. Bob, have
you seen David?

1611
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:14,130
No. No Frost, no Reston.

1612
01:29:24,310 --> 01:29:27,060
Morning. Good morning.
Come on, let's go.

1613
01:29:31,070 --> 01:29:32,780
What's that about?

1614
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:42,450
First time he's late.

1615
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:56,930
Mr. President!

1616
01:30:13,690 --> 01:30:14,900
Morning.

1617
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:54,820
Mr. President.

1618
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,700
Mr. Frost.

1619
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:13,800
Thirty seconds to tape roll!

1620
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:20,760
Thirty seconds.
Settling. Settle.

1621
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:36,440
Well, if today's session is anything like
our phone call, it should be explosive.

1622
01:31:37,650 --> 01:31:39,610
What phone call?

1623
01:31:40,110 --> 01:31:42,120
The phone call
to my hotel room.

1624
01:31:45,290 --> 01:31:50,710
David, starting on camera three
in four, three, two and...

1625
01:31:57,340 --> 01:32:00,590
Now, looking back on your
final year in office,

1626
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:03,050
do you feel you ever
obstructed justice

1627
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:06,470
or were part of a conspiracy to
cover up or obstruct justice?

1628
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:07,640
No.

1629
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:13,440
And l'm interested that you used
the term "obstruction of justice."

1630
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,610
Now, you perhaps have not
read the statute

1631
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,860
with regard to the
obstruction of justice.

1632
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:20,490
As it happens, l have.

1633
01:32:20,570 --> 01:32:27,200
You have, you say? Well, then, you'll
know it doesn't just require an act.

1634
01:32:27,290 --> 01:32:30,870
Lt requires a specific
corrupt motive.

1635
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:34,250
And in this case, l didn't
have a corrupt motive.

1636
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:37,880
What l was doing was in the
interests of political containment.

1637
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:40,130
Be that as it may,
the direct consequences

1638
01:32:40,220 --> 01:32:41,800
of your actions would have been

1639
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:43,550
that two of
the convicted burglars

1640
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:45,510
would have escaped
criminal prosecution.

1641
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:48,890
Now, how can that not be a cover-up
or obstruction of justice?

1642
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:50,730
Well, l think the record
shows, Mr. Frost,

1643
01:32:50,810 --> 01:32:54,020
that far from
obstructing justice,

1644
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:56,610
l was actively facilitating it.

1645
01:32:56,690 --> 01:33:01,070
When Pat Gray of the FBl
telephoned me, this was July 6,

1646
01:33:01,150 --> 01:33:04,570
l said, "Pat, you go right ahead
with your investigation."

1647
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:06,910
That's hardly what you'd
call obstructing justice.

1648
01:33:06,990 --> 01:33:10,080
Well, that may be, but for
two weeks prior to July 6,

1649
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:11,660
we now know that
you were desperately

1650
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:13,160
trying to contain or block
the investigation.

1651
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:14,970
No, no. Hang on a minute there.
L wasn't...

1652
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,790
No, no. Obstruction of justice
is obstruction of justice,

1653
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:18,750
whether it's for
a minute or five minutes,

1654
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:20,880
and it's no defense
to say that your plan failed.

1655
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:23,720
L mean, if l try to rob a bank
and fail, that's no defense.

1656
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:25,260
L still tried to rob the bank.

1657
01:33:25,340 --> 01:33:27,970
Will you just wait one
minute there, Mr. Frost?

1658
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:30,470
There is no evidence
of any kind that l was...

1659
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,000
Well, the reason
there is no evidence

1660
01:33:32,060 --> 01:33:33,730
is because
18 and a half minutes

1661
01:33:33,810 --> 01:33:37,020
of the conversation with Bob
Haldeman from this June period

1662
01:33:37,110 --> 01:33:38,770
have mysteriously been erased.

1663
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:41,740
That was an unfortunate
oversight.

1664
01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:43,280
And Bob Haldeman is a rigorous

1665
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,860
and a conscientious note taker.

1666
01:33:45,950 --> 01:33:47,780
His notes are there
for all to see.

1667
01:33:47,870 --> 01:33:50,620
Well, we found something
rather better than his notes,

1668
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:54,250
a conversation
with Charles Colson,

1669
01:33:55,210 --> 01:33:58,130
which l don't think
has ever been published.

1670
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:01,670
Okay, here we go.

1671
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:03,670
Lt hasn't been
published, you say?

1672
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:06,890
No, but one of my researchers
found it in Washington

1673
01:34:07,510 --> 01:34:10,600
where it's available to anyone
who consults the records.

1674
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:15,310
Well, l just wondered,
you know, if we'd seen it.

1675
01:34:15,390 --> 01:34:16,850
More than seen it,
Mr. President.

1676
01:34:16,940 --> 01:34:18,610
You spoke the actual words.

1677
01:34:18,690 --> 01:34:22,940
Now, you've always claimed you first
learned of the break-in on June 23.

1678
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:24,070
Yeah.

1679
01:34:24,150 --> 01:34:27,780
But this transcript of a tape
made three days earlier

1680
01:34:27,870 --> 01:34:30,330
clearly shows that
to be a falsehood.

1681
01:34:30,910 --> 01:34:36,410
Now, in it you say to Colson,
"This whole investigation rests

1682
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:43,000
"unless one of the seven
begins to talk.

1683
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:47,510
"That's the problem."

1684
01:34:47,590 --> 01:34:51,100
Well, what do we
mean when we say

1685
01:34:51,180 --> 01:34:53,310
"one of the seven
beginning to talk"?

1686
01:34:53,390 --> 01:34:56,690
Then moving on to a conversation
you had with John Dean

1687
01:34:56,770 --> 01:34:58,230
on March 21,
the following year.

1688
01:34:58,310 --> 01:35:01,270
Ln one transcript alone,
there in black and white,

1689
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:03,020
l picked out,
and these are your words,

1690
01:35:03,110 --> 01:35:06,820
one, "You could get $1 million,
and you could get it in cash.

1691
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:08,320
"l know where it
could be gotten."

1692
01:35:08,410 --> 01:35:11,740
Two, "Your major guy to keep
under control is Hunt."

1693
01:35:12,330 --> 01:35:15,200
Three, "Don't we have to
handle the Hunt situation?"

1694
01:35:15,290 --> 01:35:17,040
Four, "Get the million bucks.

1695
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:19,580
"lt would seem to me
that would be worthwhile."

1696
01:35:19,670 --> 01:35:22,460
Five, "Don't you agree that you'd
better get the Hunt thing going?"

1697
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:24,380
Six, "First you've got
the Hunt problem.

1698
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:27,090
"That ought to be handled." Seven,
"The money can be provided.

1699
01:35:27,170 --> 01:35:29,630
"Ehrlichman could provide
the way to deliver it."

1700
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:31,390
Eight,
"We've no choice with Hunt

1701
01:35:31,470 --> 01:35:34,350
"but the $120,000 or
whatever it is, right?"

1702
01:35:34,430 --> 01:35:37,810
Nine, "Christ, turn over
any cash we've got."

1703
01:35:37,890 --> 01:35:39,370
And l could go on.
Now, it seems to me

1704
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:41,060
that someone
running a cover-up

1705
01:35:41,150 --> 01:35:43,190
couldn't have expressed it more
clearly than that, could they?

1706
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:44,820
Look, let me just stop
you now right there,

1707
01:35:44,900 --> 01:35:47,030
because you're doing
something here

1708
01:35:47,110 --> 01:35:49,400
which l am not doing,
and l will not do

1709
01:35:49,490 --> 01:35:51,740
throughout these
entire broadcasts.

1710
01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:53,910
You're quoting me
out of context,

1711
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:56,200
out of order.
And l might add,

1712
01:35:56,290 --> 01:35:58,580
l have participated
in all these interviews

1713
01:35:58,660 --> 01:36:00,460
without a single note
in front of me.

1714
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:02,040
Well, it is your life,
Mr. President.

1715
01:36:02,130 --> 01:36:03,290
Now, you've always maintained

1716
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:06,210
that you knew nothing about
any of this until March 21.

1717
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:09,840
But in February, your personal
lawyer came to Washington

1718
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:12,970
to start the raising
of $219,000

1719
01:36:13,050 --> 01:36:15,050
of hush money to be
paid to the burglars.

1720
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:18,060
Now, do you seriously
expect us to believe

1721
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:19,730
that you had
no knowledge of that?

1722
01:36:19,810 --> 01:36:23,100
None. l believed the money was
for humanitarian purposes.

1723
01:36:23,190 --> 01:36:25,770
To help disadvantaged
people with their defenses.

1724
01:36:25,860 --> 01:36:29,610
Well, it was being delivered on the
tops of phone booths with aliases,

1725
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:31,950
and at airports
by people with gloves on.

1726
01:36:32,030 --> 01:36:34,120
That's not normally the way
lawyers' fees are delivered, is it?

1727
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:36,740
Look, l have made statements
to this effect before.

1728
01:36:36,830 --> 01:36:39,000
All that was Haldeman
and Ehrlichman's business.

1729
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:41,210
L knew nothing.
Okay, fine. Fine!

1730
01:36:41,290 --> 01:36:42,580
You made a conclusion there.

1731
01:36:42,670 --> 01:36:44,250
L stated my view,
now let's move on.

1732
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:45,420
Let's get on to the rest of it.

1733
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:46,500
No, hold on.
No, hold on.

1734
01:36:46,590 --> 01:36:47,590
No, l don't want to talk...

1735
01:36:47,670 --> 01:36:49,380
lf Haldeman and Ehrlichman were
the ones really responsible,

1736
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:52,260
when you subsequently
found out about it,

1737
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:54,460
why didn't you call the police
and have them arrested?

1738
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:56,470
Lsn't that just
a cover-up of another kind?

1739
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,220
Yeah, maybe l should have done that.
Maybe l should have.

1740
01:36:58,310 --> 01:37:00,060
Just called the feds
into my office

1741
01:37:00,140 --> 01:37:02,270
and said, "Hey,
there's the two men.

1742
01:37:02,350 --> 01:37:03,810
"Haul them down to the dock,

1743
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:05,980
"fingerprint them and then
throw them in the can."

1744
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:07,150
l'm not made that way.

1745
01:37:07,230 --> 01:37:10,240
These men, Haldeman, Ehrlichman,
l knew their families.

1746
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,150
L knew them since
they were just kids.

1747
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:13,530
Yeah, but you know,
politically,

1748
01:37:13,610 --> 01:37:16,490
the pressure on me to let them
go, that became overwhelming!

1749
01:37:16,580 --> 01:37:19,410
So l did it.
L cut off one arm,

1750
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:22,210
then l cut off the other,
and l'm not a good butcher!

1751
01:37:22,290 --> 01:37:25,170
And l have always maintained
what they were doing,

1752
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:27,500
what we were all doing,
was not criminal.

1753
01:37:27,590 --> 01:37:29,130
Look, when you're in office,

1754
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:32,470
you gotta do a lot of things
sometimes that are not always,

1755
01:37:32,550 --> 01:37:36,090
in the strictest sense of the
law, legal, but you do them

1756
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:38,390
because they're in the greater
interests of the nation!

1757
01:37:38,470 --> 01:37:40,190
Right. Wait, just so
l understand correctly,

1758
01:37:40,270 --> 01:37:42,980
are you really saying
that in certain situations,

1759
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:46,020
the President can decide whether it's
in the best interests of the nation

1760
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:48,190
and then do something illegal?

1761
01:37:48,270 --> 01:37:53,150
L'm saying that when the President
does it, that means it's not illegal.

1762
01:37:55,530 --> 01:37:56,990
L'm sorry?

1763
01:37:57,070 --> 01:37:58,950
That's what l believe.

1764
01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:01,330
Oh, my God.

1765
01:38:06,290 --> 01:38:11,170
But l realize no one
else shares that view.

1766
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:18,260
So, in that case,
will you accept, then,

1767
01:38:18,470 --> 01:38:20,970
to clear the air
once and for all,

1768
01:38:21,470 --> 01:38:23,640
that you were part
of a cover-up

1769
01:38:23,730 --> 01:38:27,150
and that you did break the law?

1770
01:38:36,530 --> 01:38:38,820
- Oh, my God, we got him.
- L...

1771
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:40,450
Shit!

1772
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:43,580
Okay, let's take a break there.

1773
01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:45,080
What the fuck is going on?

1774
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:46,750
Cut it. Cut it.

1775
01:38:46,830 --> 01:38:47,830
Excuse me?
Shut it down.

1776
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:48,960
Shut it down now.

1777
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:51,880
That's not my call. You're gonna
have to talk to the director.

1778
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,500
He's in that truck out there.
Get him in here.

1779
01:38:53,590 --> 01:38:55,340
Listen, we have
an issue in here.

1780
01:38:55,420 --> 01:38:57,180
Jack, what are you doing?
A break?

1781
01:38:57,260 --> 01:38:58,340
Change the tapes.

1782
01:38:58,430 --> 01:38:59,930
David, can l talk to you
for a minute, please?

1783
01:39:00,010 --> 01:39:01,510
What the hell is
going on, Jack?

1784
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:03,140
He was about to blow
and you know it.

1785
01:39:03,220 --> 01:39:05,310
Fellas, this is a critical
moment in his life.

1786
01:39:05,390 --> 01:39:06,430
You realize we could
sue you for this?

1787
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:08,940
You have deliberately sabotaged
the interview, Jack.

1788
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:10,020
Look, we're all
in this together.

1789
01:39:10,110 --> 01:39:11,110
L'm sure we can
find a solution.

1790
01:39:11,190 --> 01:39:14,110
A solution? What the hell are you talking about?
Lt's an interview!

1791
01:39:14,190 --> 01:39:15,490
Bob, may l remind you...

1792
01:39:15,570 --> 01:39:17,250
This is a breach of contract.
We could sue.

1793
01:39:20,570 --> 01:39:22,700
For heaven's sake, Jim. Why
don't you give him a week off?

1794
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:23,790
Give him a year off!

1795
01:39:23,870 --> 01:39:25,120
Give him a fucking massage!

1796
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:27,330
Watch your language,
for crying out loud.

1797
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:46,560
What'd you do? Throw
in the towel, Jack?

1798
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:49,940
Did you take pity on me?

1799
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:54,150
Sir, l just felt that

1800
01:39:55,650 --> 01:39:59,990
if you were going to make some
kind of emotional disclosure,

1801
01:40:00,070 --> 01:40:03,280
that we should
just take a moment

1802
01:40:03,370 --> 01:40:06,120
to think it through,
sketch it out.

1803
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:09,960
L just want to impress upon you

1804
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:12,670
how crucially important
this moment is

1805
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:17,760
and how many potentially
devastating consequences

1806
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:20,170
unplanned emotional
disclosures could have.

1807
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:21,510
L know.

1808
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:26,260
But to go on and carry on
denying it all...

1809
01:40:47,830 --> 01:40:49,830
l appreciate the gesture.

1810
01:40:55,710 --> 01:40:57,750
We ought to call it a snafu.

1811
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:09,220
Jack, are we on?

1812
01:41:12,140 --> 01:41:13,730
We're on. Okay, he's had
plenty of time to cook up

1813
01:41:13,810 --> 01:41:16,060
some sort of slippery new
bullshit, so stay on your toes.

1814
01:41:16,150 --> 01:41:19,730
Listen, it's gonna be fine.
Pick up where you left off.

1815
01:41:58,820 --> 01:42:01,110
Thirty seconds, everyone.

1816
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:15,000
Ten seconds.

1817
01:42:20,210 --> 01:42:25,930
David? Four, three,
two, and...

1818
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:28,800
Mr. President,
we were talking about

1819
01:42:28,890 --> 01:42:31,560
the period
March 21 to April 30,

1820
01:42:31,640 --> 01:42:35,810
and the mistakes you made, and
so on, and l was wondering

1821
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:41,570
would you go
further than "mistakes"?

1822
01:42:41,650 --> 01:42:45,400
The word that seems not enough
for people to understand.

1823
01:42:47,700 --> 01:42:50,620
Well, what word
would you express?

1824
01:42:58,630 --> 01:43:00,210
My goodness.

1825
01:43:05,050 --> 01:43:06,300
All right.

1826
01:43:07,510 --> 01:43:10,430
Since you've asked me, l
think there are three things

1827
01:43:10,510 --> 01:43:13,600
that people would
like to hear you say.

1828
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:18,100
One, that there was
probably more than mistakes.

1829
01:43:18,190 --> 01:43:21,110
There was wrongdoing.

1830
01:43:21,190 --> 01:43:24,030
And, yes, it might
have been a crime, too.

1831
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:30,620
Secondly, that "l did abuse the
power l had as President."

1832
01:43:32,370 --> 01:43:35,240
And thirdly,
"l put the American people

1833
01:43:35,330 --> 01:43:38,160
"through two years
of needless agony,

1834
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:42,750
"and l apologize for that." And
l know how difficult it is

1835
01:43:43,170 --> 01:43:46,460
for anyone, especially you,

1836
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:51,720
but l think the people
need to hear it.

1837
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:54,640
And l think that
unless you say it,

1838
01:43:55,810 --> 01:43:59,270
you're going to be haunted
for the rest of your life.

1839
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:09,070
Well, it's true. l made
mistakes, horrendous ones,

1840
01:44:10,820 --> 01:44:14,120
ones that were not
worthy of a president,

1841
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:19,000
ones that did not meet the
standards of excellence

1842
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:22,880
that l always dreamed of
as a young boy.

1843
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:28,630
But, if you remember,
it was a difficult time.

1844
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:33,680
L was caught up
in a five-front war

1845
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:37,850
against a partisan media,
a partisan House of Congress,

1846
01:44:37,930 --> 01:44:40,640
a partisan Ervin Committee.

1847
01:44:42,150 --> 01:44:45,900
But, yes, l will admit
there were times

1848
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:49,110
l did not fully meet
that responsibility

1849
01:44:49,190 --> 01:44:53,990
and l was involved in a
cover-up, as you call it.

1850
01:44:54,660 --> 01:44:58,660
And for all those mistakes
l have a very deep regret.

1851
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:06,170
No one can know what it's like
to resign the presidency.

1852
01:45:08,170 --> 01:45:09,260
Now,

1853
01:45:11,050 --> 01:45:15,760
if you want me to get down
on the floor and grovel...

1854
01:45:16,890 --> 01:45:19,390
No! Never!

1855
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:23,440
L still insist they were
mistakes of the heart.

1856
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:25,060
They were not
mistakes of the head.

1857
01:45:25,150 --> 01:45:28,860
But they were my mistakes.
L don't blame anybody.

1858
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:32,070
L brought myself down.

1859
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:38,830
L gave them a sword,
and they stuck it in,

1860
01:45:38,910 --> 01:45:42,540
and they twisted it
with relish.

1861
01:45:43,540 --> 01:45:47,790
And l guess if l'd been in their
place, l'd have done the same thing.

1862
01:45:48,090 --> 01:45:50,500
And the American people?

1863
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:11,230
L let them down.

1864
01:46:13,860 --> 01:46:16,110
L let down my friends.

1865
01:46:18,950 --> 01:46:23,660
L let down the country.

1866
01:46:27,540 --> 01:46:29,210
And worst of all,

1867
01:46:32,710 --> 01:46:35,510
l let down
our system of government.

1868
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:39,550
And the dreams of
all those young people

1869
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:41,560
that ought to get
into government,

1870
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:45,890
but now they think, "lt's all
too corrupt," and the rest.

1871
01:46:47,310 --> 01:46:48,400
Yeah.

1872
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:56,990
L let the American people down,

1873
01:47:01,370 --> 01:47:04,540
and l'm gonna have to
carry that burden with me

1874
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:08,170
for the rest of my life.

1875
01:47:19,890 --> 01:47:22,300
My political life is over.

1876
01:47:50,210 --> 01:47:54,420
You know, the first and greatest
sin or deception of television

1877
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:57,970
is that it simplifies,
it diminishes,

1878
01:47:58,260 --> 01:48:02,720
great, complex ideas,
tranches of time.

1879
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:07,730
Whole careers become reduced
to a single snapshot.

1880
01:48:08,730 --> 01:48:10,900
At first, l couldn't
understand why

1881
01:48:10,980 --> 01:48:13,310
Bob Zelnick was
quite as euphoric

1882
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:15,610
as he was after the interviews,

1883
01:48:18,450 --> 01:48:22,200
or why John Birt felt
moved to strip naked

1884
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:25,160
and rush into
the ocean to celebrate.

1885
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:29,910
But that was before
l really understood

1886
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,790
the reductive power
of the close-up.

1887
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:36,710
Because David had
succeeded on that final day

1888
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:38,590
in getting,
for a fleeting moment,

1889
01:48:38,670 --> 01:48:40,170
what no investigative
journalist,

1890
01:48:40,260 --> 01:48:43,970
no state prosecutor,
no judiciary committee

1891
01:48:44,050 --> 01:48:47,220
or political enemy
had managed to get.

1892
01:48:47,430 --> 01:48:49,810
Richard Nixon's face,

1893
01:48:49,890 --> 01:48:55,560
swollen and ravaged by loneliness,
self-loathing and defeat.

1894
01:48:56,980 --> 01:49:00,690
The rest of the project and its
failings would not only be forgotten,

1895
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:03,030
they would totally
cease to exist.

1896
01:49:10,750 --> 01:49:13,290
Who came out
on top, Mr. President?

1897
01:49:33,060 --> 01:49:35,400
Ls this what you
call a dachshund?

1898
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:36,650
Mmm-hmm.

1899
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:46,450
Very sweet.

1900
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:20,440
The Nixon/Frost interviews
were wildly successful.

1901
01:50:20,530 --> 01:50:23,110
L think they attracted the largest
audience for a news program

1902
01:50:23,190 --> 01:50:24,860
in the history of
American television.

1903
01:50:24,950 --> 01:50:28,070
David was on the cover of Time
magazine and Newsweek magazine.

1904
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:29,410
And even the political
press corps,

1905
01:50:29,490 --> 01:50:30,660
the hard-bitten
political press corps,

1906
01:50:30,740 --> 01:50:33,700
called David up with messages of
contrition and congratulation.

1907
01:50:33,790 --> 01:50:36,000
David, l want to
say congratulations.

1908
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:37,920
The interviews?

1909
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,420
No, l didn't watch them.
L couldn't.

1910
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:44,800
Hey.

1911
01:50:46,680 --> 01:50:47,840
Hello.

1912
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:58,810
L believe David saw the former
President just one more time.

1913
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:00,690
Before he left California
for London again,

1914
01:51:00,770 --> 01:51:03,400
he drove down to San
Clemente to say goodbye.

1915
01:51:15,580 --> 01:51:18,790
Hey, Mr. Frost.
Lt's nice to see you.

1916
01:51:19,750 --> 01:51:21,290
Miss Cushing.
Hello.

1917
01:51:22,460 --> 01:51:24,590
Please excuse my golf outfit.

1918
01:51:24,670 --> 01:51:27,630
Lt's the official
uniform of the retired.

1919
01:51:29,090 --> 01:51:30,550
Are you on your way home?

1920
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:31,850
Yes.

1921
01:51:31,930 --> 01:51:37,020
Lnto a bright new dawn of fresh
enterprises and challenges, eh?

1922
01:51:37,100 --> 01:51:38,310
Well, let's hope so.

1923
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:39,560
Good for you.

1924
01:51:39,650 --> 01:51:42,560
L didn't catch the
interviews as they went out,

1925
01:51:42,650 --> 01:51:46,280
but they tell me that they
were a great success.

1926
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:50,070
L gather the journalists
that were so positive

1927
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:53,160
about you weren't
so kind to me.

1928
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:56,250
Yes, l was sorry to see that.

1929
01:51:56,910 --> 01:51:59,160
There's no
condolences necessary.

1930
01:51:59,250 --> 01:52:01,790
L've grown to expect nothing
else from those sons of whores.

1931
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:03,590
Yeah.

1932
01:52:03,670 --> 01:52:06,840
Jeez, please forgive me,
Miss Cushing.

1933
01:52:07,260 --> 01:52:10,380
You know, l would've
said "sons of bitches,"

1934
01:52:10,470 --> 01:52:13,100
but Manolo here
is a lover of dogs,

1935
01:52:13,180 --> 01:52:15,470
and he hates me
to defame animals.

1936
01:52:15,970 --> 01:52:17,560
Can l get something
for somebody?

1937
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:20,060
Yes. Would you like
some tea or champagne?

1938
01:52:20,150 --> 01:52:23,400
Hey, you know, we got that
caviar the Shah of lran sent me.

1939
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:24,520
No, thank you.
You sure?

1940
01:52:24,610 --> 01:52:25,900
Come on. lt'll be
no trouble at all.

1941
01:52:25,980 --> 01:52:27,190
No, really, we must be...

1942
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:30,990
Okay, fine, fine.
Thanks for coming by.

1943
01:52:34,030 --> 01:52:36,290
You were a worthy opponent.

1944
01:52:38,290 --> 01:52:39,410
Goodbye, Mr. President.

1945
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:40,790
Bye-bye.

1946
01:52:40,870 --> 01:52:42,250
Goodbye, Mr. President.

1947
01:52:42,330 --> 01:52:43,380
Goodbye.

1948
01:52:45,130 --> 01:52:47,760
Oh, God!
L almost forgot. l...

1949
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:54,680
l brought you a present,
those shoes you admired.

1950
01:52:54,970 --> 01:52:56,720
L brought you a pair.

1951
01:52:57,890 --> 01:53:00,890
Well, jeez. Thank you.

1952
01:53:05,610 --> 01:53:10,780
L'm touched. Safe trip, now.

1953
01:53:15,160 --> 01:53:20,870
Oh! Say, David, you think l could speak
to you, privately, just for a minute?

1954
01:53:32,220 --> 01:53:34,800
Do you know those
parties of yours?

1955
01:53:34,890 --> 01:53:37,350
The ones that l read about
in all the papers?

1956
01:53:37,430 --> 01:53:40,180
Do you actually enjoy those?

1957
01:53:41,060 --> 01:53:42,430
Of course.

1958
01:53:43,980 --> 01:53:47,900
You got no idea how
fortunate that makes you.

1959
01:53:49,070 --> 01:53:53,320
You know? Liking people,
and being liked.

1960
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:58,080
Having that facility,
that lightness, that charm.

1961
01:53:59,580 --> 01:54:02,000
L don't have it.
L never did.

1962
01:54:02,790 --> 01:54:05,620
Lt kind of makes you wonder
why l chose a life

1963
01:54:05,710 --> 01:54:08,790
that hinged on being liked.

1964
01:54:09,090 --> 01:54:12,510
L'm better suited
to a life of thought,

1965
01:54:12,590 --> 01:54:14,800
debate,
intellectual discipline.

1966
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:17,050
Maybe we got it wrong.

1967
01:54:17,140 --> 01:54:19,010
Maybe you should have
been a politician

1968
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:21,430
and l the rigorous interviewer.

1969
01:54:22,060 --> 01:54:23,310
Maybe.

1970
01:54:24,770 --> 01:54:25,890
David.

1971
01:54:28,230 --> 01:54:31,690
Did l really
call you that night?

1972
01:54:34,030 --> 01:54:35,240
Yes.

1973
01:54:36,110 --> 01:54:39,950
Did we discuss
anything important?

1974
01:54:44,250 --> 01:54:45,710
Cheeseburgers.

1975
01:54:48,130 --> 01:54:49,670
Cheeseburgers?

1976
01:54:55,380 --> 01:54:56,880
Goodbye, sir.

1977
01:55:07,060 --> 01:55:09,230
Well, New York,
London and Sydney

1978
01:55:09,310 --> 01:55:11,730
welcomed David
back with open arms,

1979
01:55:11,820 --> 01:55:13,530
as did his friends
and investors,

1980
01:55:13,610 --> 01:55:16,070
who've made a fortune
from these interviews.

1981
01:55:16,150 --> 01:55:17,740
He got back all of his shows.

1982
01:55:17,820 --> 01:55:20,070
He even got back
his table at Sardi's.

1983
01:55:20,830 --> 01:55:22,200
As for Richard Nixon,

1984
01:55:22,290 --> 01:55:23,570
well, he certainly
never achieved

1985
01:55:23,580 --> 01:55:26,250
the rehabilitation
he so desperately craved.

1986
01:55:26,330 --> 01:55:28,500
His most lasting legacy

1987
01:55:28,580 --> 01:55:31,380
is that today
any political wrongdoing

1988
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:33,300
is immediately given
the suffix "gate."
