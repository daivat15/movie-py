1
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:51,156
- Are yous ready?
- Aye.

2
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,034
On your marks. Get set.

3
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,798
Go!

4
00:01:22,368 --> 00:01:24,443
Stew, Dr Garrigan?

5
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,785
And you, Dr Garrigan?

6
00:01:32,334 --> 00:01:36,316
- I thought that...
- Mother.

7
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,195
...seeing as we've something to celebrate,
we might have a wee drop.

8
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:43,655
Sherry, right. Great.

9
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,534
- We are very proud of you, Nicholas.
- Very proud.

10
00:01:48,638 --> 00:01:54,177
Not quite as good a degree as mine,
but a fine one nevertheless.

11
00:01:56,728 --> 00:02:02,895
Being a family doctor. Let me tell you,
Nicholas, you've chosen a fine life.

12
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:06,923
If you'll both raise your glasses,

13
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:08,758
a toast.

14
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,103
To father and son.

15
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,440
A long future together.

16
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,783
Nicholas, are you all right in there?

17
00:02:40,887 --> 00:02:42,962
I'm fine.

18
00:02:45,182 --> 00:02:46,759
I'm fine.

19
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,166
OK, first place you land, you go.

20
00:02:52,271 --> 00:02:55,188
First place you land, you go.

21
00:02:58,734 --> 00:03:00,607
Canada.

22
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:08,700
What are all the soldiers for?

23
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:11,853
- Do you speak English?
- Yes.

24
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,230
What are all the soldiers for?

25
00:04:14,334 --> 00:04:17,149
The army's taking over. There is a coup.

26
00:04:17,253 --> 00:04:20,235
- A coup? What? Are we safe?
- Don't worry.

27
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,571
These are General Amin's men.
He fights for the people.

28
00:04:23,675 --> 00:04:26,248
- It's a very happy day for us.
- OK.

29
00:04:42,523 --> 00:04:43,933
- Is that him?
- Yes.

30
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:50,233
- What do you do in Scotland?
- I'm a doctor, a qualified doctor.

31
00:04:51,196 --> 00:04:53,817
I thought I could maybe use my skills here.

32
00:04:57,576 --> 00:05:01,600
- Monkeys. Look. Look up there, Tolu.
- Do you have monkeys in Scotland?

33
00:05:01,705 --> 00:05:04,325
No, we don't have monkeys in Scotland.

34
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,286
No. If we had monkeys in Scotland,
we'd probably deep-fry them.

35
00:05:32,395 --> 00:05:35,230
This is my stop.

36
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:43,985
I'm a medical officer overseas.

37
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:15,547
Dr Garrigan.

38
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:22,872
- Dr Merrit?
- No. I'm Sarah, David's wife. Welcome.

39
00:06:22,976 --> 00:06:26,208
- Hello.
- David was called out on an emergency.

40
00:06:26,312 --> 00:06:31,670
- I hope everything's OK.
- Just normal business here. Safe journey?

41
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:34,047
- You know. It was...
- Bloody awful?

42
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:37,091
A goat up your arse
and your face in someone's armpit.

43
00:06:37,195 --> 00:06:41,261
Last time I did that trip, I nearly asphyxiated.

44
00:06:41,365 --> 00:06:43,523
Right, hop in.

45
00:06:50,372 --> 00:06:54,229
- Actually, I waited for the bus yesterday, too.
- Yeah?

46
00:06:54,334 --> 00:07:00,252
We were getting a little worried about you,
thought you might be caught up in the coup.

47
00:07:02,382 --> 00:07:06,197
It's official now, by the way.
Obote's out. The radio's full of it.

48
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,991
Who's Obote?

49
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,785
- Ex-president.
- Right. And whatshisname.

50
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,538
Amin. He's taken over, yeah?

51
00:07:15,642 --> 00:07:18,331
You've certainly come at a busy time.

52
00:07:18,436 --> 00:07:21,555
Whatever I can do to help.

53
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,773
- Morning, Nicholas.
- Morning.

54
00:07:50,878 --> 00:07:54,080
- So, what do you think?
- Aye, fine.

55
00:07:54,756 --> 00:07:56,486
Come on. Come through.

56
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:01,198
This is the operating room.
Simple procedures for the most part.

57
00:08:01,302 --> 00:08:03,591
- Morning.
- Morning.

58
00:08:05,764 --> 00:08:08,454
So, how many doctors are there here?

59
00:08:08,558 --> 00:08:11,706
Well, there's me and now there's you.

60
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:14,500
- Morning, Sister.
- Morning.

61
00:08:14,604 --> 00:08:17,794
You know, the interesting thing is,

62
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:22,548
80<i>º</i>/% of the locals
still prefer the witch doctor to us.

63
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:27,942
Sometimes I think we're just
skimming the surface of an ocean.

64
00:08:28,991 --> 00:08:30,846
- Ready?
- Yeah.

65
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,488
There we are.

66
00:08:33,703 --> 00:08:36,184
There we go. Yeah.

67
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:37,995
OK.

68
00:08:39,332 --> 00:08:40,992
Yes, thank you.

69
00:08:42,334 --> 00:08:45,733
OK, and one more. OK, who's next?

70
00:08:45,837 --> 00:08:48,588
That's a lovely name. OK. Can I see?

71
00:09:09,355 --> 00:09:12,272
You ready? Now, come on, Angela.

72
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:57,225
Dr Merrit.

73
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:01,708
What is it?

74
00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:05,044
- Complications with the Mugisha baby.
- I'll go.

75
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:07,983
No, I better go. I know the mother.

76
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:11,132
Sorry.

77
00:10:11,237 --> 00:10:13,727
I'll be back in an hour or two.

78
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,763
Bonny.

79
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,973
- Jump in.
- Hi, Bonny.

80
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,199
Hi.

81
00:10:33,921 --> 00:10:37,194
- I hope you don't mind me saying this, but...
- Yeah?

82
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:41,876
You seem an unlikely candidate
for this kind of work.

83
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,743
Why? Cos I don't wear socks and sandals?

84
00:10:45,847 --> 00:10:47,744
Touché.

85
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:50,580
I still want to make a difference, you know.

86
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:52,957
- Really?
- Yes, really.

87
00:10:53,061 --> 00:10:58,461
I wanna have fun, too, though.
A bit of adventure, something different.

88
00:10:58,565 --> 00:11:00,462
That's a lot of things.

89
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:02,559
Is it?

90
00:11:10,991 --> 00:11:12,189
Doctor.

91
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:30,207
A beautiful goal for Scotland.

92
00:11:35,385 --> 00:11:38,075
- A good one.
- Bonny, why are the women singing?

93
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:41,713
You don't know?
The president is coming to the village.

94
00:11:43,058 --> 00:11:45,497
Where's Dr Merrit?

95
00:11:45,602 --> 00:11:48,270
He has gone to town for stores.

96
00:11:49,313 --> 00:11:53,837
Come on. I thought you might be
slightly curious to see the new boss.

97
00:11:53,941 --> 00:11:57,006
I don't work for Amin.

98
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,924
Right. Fine.

99
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:02,029
I just thought it might be fun.

100
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:07,318
OK.

101
00:12:08,286 --> 00:12:10,361
OK.

102
00:12:26,258 --> 00:12:29,508
Amin.

103
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:04,319
Uganda.

104
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:11,913
Uganda. Uganda.

105
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:21,947
And I want to promise you

106
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:26,796
this will be a government
of action, not of words.

107
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:34,415
We will build new schools,

108
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,891
new roads

109
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:41,022
and new houses.

110
00:13:42,693 --> 00:13:45,174
I may wear

111
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:48,527
the uniform of a general,

112
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:52,721
but...

113
00:13:52,825 --> 00:13:56,266
In my heart, I am a simple man

114
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,445
like you.

115
00:13:59,497 --> 00:14:04,491
I know who you are
and everything that you are.

116
00:14:05,001 --> 00:14:06,661
I am you.

117
00:14:08,046 --> 00:14:10,068
Ask my soldiers.

118
00:14:10,172 --> 00:14:12,862
All my life, I never eat food

119
00:14:12,966 --> 00:14:16,666
until my soldiers have eaten first.

120
00:14:19,388 --> 00:14:22,828
It will be like this in Uganda now.

121
00:14:22,932 --> 00:14:27,143
Together, we will make this country better.

122
00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:32,680
And stronger.

123
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,812
And free.

124
00:14:40,404 --> 00:14:43,025
Uganda.

125
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,864
Uganda.

126
00:14:45,074 --> 00:14:46,817
Uganda.

127
00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:53,226
- Have you seen enough now?
- What?

128
00:14:53,331 --> 00:14:56,145
Have you seen enough now?

129
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,408
Just a couple of minutes.

130
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:11,798
- Can we please go now?
- OK.

131
00:15:26,273 --> 00:15:29,380
They sang just like that for Obote,

132
00:15:29,484 --> 00:15:33,258
until they realised he turned their economy
into his bank account.

133
00:15:33,362 --> 00:15:37,052
- Come on. Give the man a chance.
- I'm serious.

134
00:15:37,156 --> 00:15:39,647
You talk to me in a couple of years.

135
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:48,532
What's going on?

136
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,994
Jesus.

137
00:15:55,838 --> 00:16:00,415
- What's the problem?
- They're looking for a doctor.

138
00:16:01,717 --> 00:16:06,575
- The president's been hurt in an accident.
- We have to come. We'll follow you.

139
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,553
God. Terrifying.

140
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:23,725
My hand.

141
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:27,466
My hand is broken.

142
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:30,322
Get that farmer out of my sight.

143
00:16:41,707 --> 00:16:43,912
Come. Come here.

144
00:16:45,876 --> 00:16:51,748
I'm Dr Garrigan. I hear you have a problem
with your hand. I'd like to examine it.

145
00:16:56,218 --> 00:16:59,337
There you go.
Could you just raise your thumb like that?

146
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:04,495
- How's that? Is that OK?
- Yeah.

147
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:09,624
Sarah, I think we're gonna need a splint. Can
somebody do something about that cow?

148
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:13,669
I don't think you've broken it.
I think it's just sprained.

149
00:17:13,773 --> 00:17:16,773
Please, it's in pain.

150
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:30,807
Can you hold that there
with your other hand, please?

151
00:17:30,911 --> 00:17:36,367
Sarah, can you go and talk to that farmer
about his cow, please?

152
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:50,089
Sarah, how's it going?

153
00:17:58,975 --> 00:18:03,291
- Somebody put that animal out of its misery.
- I am trying to explain to them.

154
00:18:03,395 --> 00:18:04,889
For God's sake.

155
00:18:27,831 --> 00:18:29,622
I'm sorry.

156
00:18:31,584 --> 00:18:34,857
- I couldn't hear myself think.
- You took my gun.

157
00:18:34,961 --> 00:18:36,441
- Yeah.
- Who are you?

158
00:18:36,546 --> 00:18:41,112
Nicholas G... I'm Dr Nicholas Garrigan.
I work at the medical compound in Mogambo.

159
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:45,073
- I'm a doctor.
- You are British?

160
00:18:45,177 --> 00:18:48,012
I'm Scottish. I'm Scottish.

161
00:18:49,055 --> 00:18:51,370
Scottish.

162
00:18:51,474 --> 00:18:55,123
Why didn't you say so?
I fought with the Scots against the Mau Mau.

163
00:18:55,227 --> 00:18:58,834
Great soldiers. Very brave.
And good people, completely.

164
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:04,380
Let me tell you, if I could be anything
instead of a Ugandan, I would be a Scot.

165
00:19:04,484 --> 00:19:06,090
Right. Really?

166
00:19:06,194 --> 00:19:11,761
Except for the red hair,
which I am sure is attractive to your women,

167
00:19:11,865 --> 00:19:15,909
but which we Africans,
we find this quite disgusting.

168
00:19:17,786 --> 00:19:21,949
Thank you, Dr Garrigan. A very good job.

169
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,230
Please.

170
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:31,067
Would you let me have this T-shirt?
My son Campbell, he would love this T-shirt.

171
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:34,737
- You've got a son called Campbell?
- Yeah.

172
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:39,073
Maybe you would take my shirt here
in exchange.

173
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,964
Right. Of course. Yeah.

174
00:19:48,602 --> 00:19:50,428
Thank you.

175
00:19:51,729 --> 00:19:55,044
You see? Now you are a general like me.

176
00:19:55,148 --> 00:19:57,224
Salute, please.

177
00:19:59,735 --> 00:20:02,142
Now I must leave.

178
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:28,508
I bet you that's worth a few bob.

179
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,382
I still can't believe how you shot that cow.

180
00:20:39,433 --> 00:20:41,508
You're mad.

181
00:20:45,062 --> 00:20:49,336
- Anyway, I...
- Do you fancy a wee drink on the porch?

182
00:20:49,441 --> 00:20:51,755
No, thank you. I'm OK, really.

183
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:54,776
Nicholas, I have to go.

184
00:20:56,488 --> 00:21:00,615
Look, it's fine, all right?
We're just having a drink.

185
00:21:07,163 --> 00:21:09,394
God.

186
00:21:09,498 --> 00:21:11,729
I can't do this.

187
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,064
What?

188
00:21:14,168 --> 00:21:16,899
My husband is a good man.

189
00:21:17,004 --> 00:21:19,755
Christ. I sound ridiculous.

190
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:26,615
I guess I just need you
to understand why I'm here.

191
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,337
- It's OK. I do understand.
- No, you don't.

192
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,496
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

193
00:21:34,601 --> 00:21:37,332
It's just sometimes,

194
00:21:37,436 --> 00:21:41,385
when you're married to
such a very good man,

195
00:21:42,941 --> 00:21:46,756
it's... it makes you feel...

196
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,520
Like shit.

197
00:21:50,822 --> 00:21:53,312
My father's the same.

198
00:21:55,992 --> 00:21:58,557
And...

199
00:21:58,661 --> 00:22:01,412
it's nice to be noticed.

200
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,189
- I can't. I can't.
- Sarah, it's...

201
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,866
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

202
00:22:11,212 --> 00:22:13,360
- No, don't, please.
- Sarah, it's fine.

203
00:22:13,464 --> 00:22:15,338
Please.

204
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:43,270
Nicholas.

205
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:48,596
Nicholas, there are some people
here to see you.

206
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,390
I'll be right there, David.

207
00:22:52,495 --> 00:22:54,570
Right. Right.

208
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:00,813
- Good morning, Dr Garrigan.
- Morning.

209
00:23:00,918 --> 00:23:03,732
My name is Jonah Wasswa,
Minister of Health.

210
00:23:03,837 --> 00:23:07,068
I've been sent by
his Excellency President Amin.

211
00:23:07,173 --> 00:23:10,821
- There is something he would like to ask you.
- What?

212
00:23:10,926 --> 00:23:12,799
Sarah?

213
00:23:14,011 --> 00:23:18,577
Hey. Listen, why don't you tell David
to rearrange the field trip for Friday?

214
00:23:18,682 --> 00:23:25,264
I'll be back as soon as I can. He probably just
wants me to retie his bandages. See you later.

215
00:23:34,194 --> 00:23:38,384
- My name is Masanga.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Nicholas.

216
00:23:38,489 --> 00:23:43,826
Pleased to meet you, Mr Nicholas.
Welcome to the president's car.

217
00:23:49,164 --> 00:23:51,488
They think you are the president.

218
00:23:51,707 --> 00:23:54,624
They think you are the president.

219
00:24:57,633 --> 00:24:59,709
The president's house.

220
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,494
Please, sit down.

221
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:10,706
- His Excellency will be with you in a moment.
- Who's this?

222
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:14,209
- Dr Junju. The previous incumbent.
- Of what?

223
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:20,297
Of the post
of personal physician to the president.

224
00:25:20,401 --> 00:25:24,861
Hold on to your guns, everyone.
Hold on to your guns.

225
00:25:28,366 --> 00:25:31,681
Good to see you again, Dr Garrigan.
You see, Jonah?

226
00:25:31,785 --> 00:25:38,036
This is the sort of man a president needs,
someone who is not afraid to speak his mind.

227
00:25:39,082 --> 00:25:43,126
So, what do you say, Nicholas?
Will you take the job?

228
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:45,942
I'm sorry.

229
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:48,797
You want me to be your physician?

230
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:54,740
- Do you want to be of service to Uganda?
- Yes, I do.

231
00:25:54,844 --> 00:26:00,411
Then what better way
than to look after the health of its president?

232
00:26:00,516 --> 00:26:03,580
Let me tell you, it will not be a difficult job

233
00:26:03,685 --> 00:26:09,794
because me, myself,
I am a man in perfect physical condition.

234
00:26:09,898 --> 00:26:14,422
Also, I know precisely when I will die.

235
00:26:14,526 --> 00:26:17,216
It came to me in a dream.

236
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,566
So you do not have to worry
about making a mistake.

237
00:26:23,075 --> 00:26:25,806
I'm really sorry. I'm very honoured, but...

238
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,448
Nicholas, I understand.

239
00:26:29,496 --> 00:26:32,645
Me, myself, I did not want to be president,

240
00:26:32,749 --> 00:26:36,106
but the people, they wanted it so.

241
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:40,317
Listen to me. This is very important.

242
00:26:40,422 --> 00:26:42,861
Here, in Kampala,

243
00:26:42,965 --> 00:26:48,282
you will have a hand in creating
a new health service for this country,

244
00:26:48,386 --> 00:26:52,300
something that will help millions of people.

245
00:26:53,432 --> 00:26:56,830
I'm sorry. I do have a commitment
to the mission in Mogambo

246
00:26:56,934 --> 00:27:00,100
and I'd be letting them down horribly.
You see?

247
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:14,344
It's the woman, the one I saw you with.
You want to get back to be with her.

248
00:27:14,448 --> 00:27:16,357
Not entirely.

249
00:27:18,076 --> 00:27:20,974
It's the woman. It's the woman.

250
00:27:21,078 --> 00:27:25,311
Why don't you tell her
to come and be here with us?

251
00:27:25,415 --> 00:27:27,896
It's not that simple. It's complicated.

252
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,398
Why?

253
00:27:30,502 --> 00:27:32,816
Is she married?

254
00:27:32,921 --> 00:27:34,996
Yes, she is.

255
00:27:37,633 --> 00:27:39,113
Doctor.

256
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:42,199
Doctor, you, you are very naughty.

257
00:27:42,303 --> 00:27:43,845
Me?

258
00:27:46,139 --> 00:27:48,662
Now you are even more interesting.

259
00:27:48,766 --> 00:27:54,104
Married woman,
they are always the most passionate.

260
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,016
- It's true.
- They are so grateful.

261
00:28:06,322 --> 00:28:09,011
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for wasting your time.

262
00:28:09,115 --> 00:28:10,804
No, no.

263
00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:14,766
My car will take you back
first thing in the morning.

264
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:20,103
But, in the meantime,
tonight we are having a state dinner.

265
00:28:20,207 --> 00:28:24,940
- Please, would you join us there?
- I'd very much like that. Thank you.

266
00:28:25,044 --> 00:28:27,567
You have a suit? A dark suit?

267
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:30,340
No. No, I don't.

268
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,207
How much is this gonna cost me, by the way?

269
00:28:46,311 --> 00:28:49,311
It's OK. It's on president's account.

270
00:28:50,231 --> 00:28:52,837
Can I just...

271
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:54,435
Stop!

272
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:06,931
- What's going on?
- Obote's men. They're everywhere.

273
00:29:07,035 --> 00:29:09,266
- Really?
- Yep.

274
00:29:09,371 --> 00:29:12,060
They're communists, you know?

275
00:29:12,164 --> 00:29:15,146
Mind you, Amin's more than
a match for them.

276
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,065
He's ex-British army. King's African Rifles.

277
00:29:18,169 --> 00:29:21,859
Jamshid, pack those up
and have them sent to the High Commission.

278
00:29:21,964 --> 00:29:23,653
OK, thank you.

279
00:29:23,757 --> 00:29:28,656
Yes, he's a little unpredictable,
but he's got a firm hand.

280
00:29:28,761 --> 00:29:34,134
Only thing the African
really understands. Thanks, Jamshid.

281
00:29:38,435 --> 00:29:42,348
Up yours, too, pal.
Bloody English.

282
00:30:04,747 --> 00:30:06,822
Hello.

283
00:30:13,671 --> 00:30:15,663
Hello.

284
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:25,284
- Hello there. How do you do?
- Nicholas. I'm so happy you came.

285
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:27,619
- So am I.
- Please. Please, this way.

286
00:30:27,723 --> 00:30:30,454
I want to introduce you
to my wives. Excuse me.

287
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:35,250
This is Malyamu. She is my first wife.
She has given me five children.

288
00:30:35,354 --> 00:30:37,001
Hello.

289
00:30:37,105 --> 00:30:40,295
And this one, Nora. She has given me three.

290
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,005
Hi there.

291
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:44,841
And that here is Kay.

292
00:30:44,945 --> 00:30:48,093
- Yes. This is Dr Nicholas Garrigan.
- Hello.

293
00:30:48,197 --> 00:30:52,597
- He saved my life.
- Really, I just stitched his hand up.

294
00:30:52,701 --> 00:30:56,266
- Don't be so modest.
- It is you I have to thank for the T-shirt.

295
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:59,560
Right. So you must be Campbell's mother?

296
00:30:59,665 --> 00:31:02,563
- Yes.
- It's a pleasure meeting you.

297
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:05,453
Come. I have to introduce you
to some people.

298
00:31:08,338 --> 00:31:09,526
Excuse me.

299
00:31:09,631 --> 00:31:13,530
This is British High Commissioner
Mr Perkins.

300
00:31:13,634 --> 00:31:17,574
- How do you do?
- Meet my good friend Dr Nicholas Garrigan.

301
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,326
- And his colleague Mr Stone.
- How do you do?

302
00:31:20,431 --> 00:31:23,996
Yes, we've already met.

303
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,498
- I will talk with you later.
- Right.

304
00:31:26,602 --> 00:31:29,709
We've been hearing
all sorts of things about you.

305
00:31:29,813 --> 00:31:33,962
Yes, I gather the president
has clasped you to his bosom.

306
00:31:34,066 --> 00:31:37,965
- No, no. Not exactly.
- What do you make of him?

307
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:40,717
I think he's doing
rather a great job. Don't you?

308
00:31:40,822 --> 00:31:45,596
Yes. There's issues to be sorted out,
but, no, he plays a pretty straight bat.

309
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,931
Yes, definitely one of us.

310
00:31:48,035 --> 00:31:51,809
Anyway, it's very good
to have another Englishman around.

311
00:31:51,913 --> 00:31:53,978
- Scot.
- What?

312
00:31:54,082 --> 00:31:56,157
I'm a Scotsman.

313
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:02,359
Ladies and gentlemen.

314
00:32:02,463 --> 00:32:07,071
Friends, I am speaking with you now
because if I wait until later,

315
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,294
you will be too drunk to hear my voice.

316
00:32:12,304 --> 00:32:15,589
Here is where civilisation began.

317
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:18,413
Here in Africa.

318
00:32:18,517 --> 00:32:23,501
Here is where the Greeks
stole their philosophy

319
00:32:23,605 --> 00:32:26,878
and the Arabs took their medicine.

320
00:32:26,982 --> 00:32:31,590
We Ugandans
must be more proud of this history.

321
00:32:31,694 --> 00:32:36,302
We are an independent African nation,

322
00:32:36,406 --> 00:32:41,281
living in peace and economic power.

323
00:32:41,744 --> 00:32:43,985
- Black power.
- Yes.

324
00:32:44,746 --> 00:32:49,787
Just like all you people
thought would never be possible.

325
00:32:52,252 --> 00:32:54,608
And now we will go through to dinner.

326
00:32:54,712 --> 00:32:57,735
The food tonight, it is all local,

327
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,237
special food.

328
00:33:00,342 --> 00:33:02,713
And none of it is human flesh.

329
00:33:04,845 --> 00:33:07,336
This is my last.

330
00:33:18,022 --> 00:33:21,639
Dr Garrigan, please come quickly.
The president is very sick.

331
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:27,717
They have poisoned me.
They are trying to assassinate me.

332
00:33:27,821 --> 00:33:29,481
Nicholas.

333
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,945
I just have to examine your stomach.

334
00:33:34,952 --> 00:33:38,309
Obote's people are everywhere.
They want me dead, Nicholas.

335
00:33:38,413 --> 00:33:41,781
OK, I just need to do this. OK?

336
00:33:42,916 --> 00:33:45,272
One more, one more.

337
00:33:45,377 --> 00:33:47,832
OK. OK. OK.

338
00:33:52,132 --> 00:33:56,793
OK, I think I know what this is.
Let me listen, just listen.

339
00:34:00,847 --> 00:34:04,760
OK. Yeah. OK.
I think I know what this is. Bear with me.

340
00:34:15,984 --> 00:34:18,590
There we are. OK?

341
00:34:18,694 --> 00:34:22,738
I'm gonna ask you
to sit on this pouf right here.

342
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:29,307
What is this? What is this?

343
00:34:29,411 --> 00:34:33,768
I'll just hold it against your stomach.
I'll ask you to stand up in three.

344
00:34:33,873 --> 00:34:36,937
One, two, three.

345
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:38,833
Go.

346
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:01,218
I feel better, much better.

347
00:35:04,438 --> 00:35:08,128
Yes, you are a good doctor. Thank you.

348
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:12,064
In future, remember
not to mix beer with aspirin.

349
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:18,360
- That was the cause?
- I think so. Yes.

350
00:35:19,366 --> 00:35:22,473
I am ashamed that you saw me like that.

351
00:35:22,577 --> 00:35:25,559
I was frightened.

352
00:35:25,663 --> 00:35:29,687
I'm a doctor. Everything that passes
between us is confidential.

353
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:32,564
OK? I've taken an oath.

354
00:35:32,668 --> 00:35:35,733
But a man who shows fear,

355
00:35:35,837 --> 00:35:39,502
he is weak and he is a slave.

356
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,591
Well, if you're afraid of dying,
it shows you have a life worth keeping.

357
00:35:51,266 --> 00:35:55,332
You see? You are a doctor,

358
00:35:55,436 --> 00:35:58,834
and also a philosopher.

359
00:35:58,939 --> 00:36:02,686
Yes. I do have a good life now.

360
00:36:03,734 --> 00:36:06,132
Please. Please, sit.

361
00:36:06,236 --> 00:36:08,109
Sit here.

362
00:36:12,574 --> 00:36:16,306
I come from a very poor family.

363
00:36:16,411 --> 00:36:21,394
I think you should know this.
My father, he left me when I was a child.

364
00:36:21,498 --> 00:36:25,188
The British army, it became my home.

365
00:36:25,292 --> 00:36:30,693
They took me as a cleaner in the kitchen,

366
00:36:30,797 --> 00:36:33,194
cleaning pots.

367
00:36:33,299 --> 00:36:35,540
They used to beat me.

368
00:36:37,093 --> 00:36:39,533
"Build this wall, Amin."

369
00:36:39,637 --> 00:36:42,201
"Dig this latrine, Amin."

370
00:36:42,306 --> 00:36:44,745
And now, here I am,

371
00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:47,422
the President of Uganda.

372
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:51,092
And who put me here?

373
00:36:53,314 --> 00:36:55,639
It was the British.

374
00:36:58,443 --> 00:37:00,731
What a story.

375
00:37:02,947 --> 00:37:06,611
- Good night, Nicholas.
- Good night, sir.

376
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,735
- Hello. Sarah, it's Nicholas.
- Nicholas, where are you?

377
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,945
I'm still in Kampala, actually.

378
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,114
Thank you.

379
00:37:30,218 --> 00:37:34,450
The president's offered me ajob.
Normally, I wouldn't even consider it,

380
00:37:34,555 --> 00:37:38,053
but, under the circumstances,

381
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,886
I thought it might be quite a good idea.

382
00:37:43,979 --> 00:37:46,267
I see.

383
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:52,006
- David will be disappointed.
- Well, I'll write to David, of course I will.

384
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,007
Of course.

385
00:37:54,111 --> 00:37:58,427
I just hope you can do as much good there
as you could've done here.

386
00:37:58,532 --> 00:38:03,056
Look, somebody's calling me. I'd better go.

387
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,682
Sure.

388
00:38:04,786 --> 00:38:08,644
All right. Listen, bye, Sarah. I'll be in touch.

389
00:38:08,748 --> 00:38:09,993
Bye.

390
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:32,887
When you're not treating the president or his
family, the hospital could use your expertise.

391
00:38:37,353 --> 00:38:40,935
This is one of our new medical wards.

392
00:38:43,775 --> 00:38:49,175
Further down the corridor are the operating
theatres, which the president has paid for.

393
00:38:49,279 --> 00:38:52,052
- Yes, sir.
- Hi, Doctor.

394
00:38:52,157 --> 00:38:54,679
Welcome to Mulago. Dr...?

395
00:38:54,784 --> 00:38:56,931
Garrigan. Hello.

396
00:38:57,035 --> 00:39:01,910
I do hope you find the hospital
up to the standard you're used to.

397
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:07,147
Excuse me. Who was that?

398
00:39:07,252 --> 00:39:10,567
Your predecessor Dr Junju.

399
00:39:10,671 --> 00:39:13,069
- Never mind him.
- Excuse me, sir.

400
00:39:13,173 --> 00:39:15,529
He's here.

401
00:39:15,633 --> 00:39:18,420
- Excuse me a moment.
- Of course.

402
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:24,214
- Hello.
- Jolly nice to meet you.

403
00:39:31,103 --> 00:39:33,511
Dr Garrigan.

404
00:39:34,398 --> 00:39:37,379
Just topping up on quinine.

405
00:39:37,483 --> 00:39:40,715
- So, you decided to stay?
- Yes, I did.

406
00:39:40,819 --> 00:39:46,595
Excellent. I just wanted to say that if there's
anything we can possibly help you with,

407
00:39:46,699 --> 00:39:49,847
please don't hesitate.

408
00:39:49,951 --> 00:39:52,656
What? You're my new best friend now?

409
00:39:54,747 --> 00:39:57,270
Do just stay in touch.

410
00:39:57,374 --> 00:39:59,188
Why?

411
00:39:59,292 --> 00:40:05,443
Well, given that we were
so intimately involved

412
00:40:05,547 --> 00:40:08,445
with the President coming to power,

413
00:40:08,549 --> 00:40:12,365
the foreign office has asked me
to point out our awareness

414
00:40:12,469 --> 00:40:18,091
of your very unique personal relationship
with President Amin.

415
00:40:20,016 --> 00:40:26,417
Should you find the need to clarify your
status regarding details of that relationship,

416
00:40:26,522 --> 00:40:32,558
we would of course welcome any clarification
you might feel the need to share with us.

417
00:40:36,154 --> 00:40:41,360
Is there some special school
where you people learn to talk that bollocks?

418
00:40:44,452 --> 00:40:47,536
Do, please, stay in touch.

419
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,249
You take care now.

420
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,403
This man is going to kill the president.

421
00:41:01,507 --> 00:41:06,085
So Nicholas walks up to that cow
and he shoots it in the head.

422
00:41:07,178 --> 00:41:10,511
On your marks. Get set.

423
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:13,871
Go!

424
00:41:13,975 --> 00:41:17,474
Amin. Amin.

425
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:24,937
I won.

426
00:41:37,118 --> 00:41:39,691
- OK. Here, Nicholas.
- No, no, no.

427
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:50,149
- Before I forget, I need to ask a favour.
- Anything.

428
00:41:50,253 --> 00:41:55,403
I will be in Libya next week, and I need you
to attend a meeting in my place.

429
00:41:55,507 --> 00:42:01,283
- What kind of meeting?
- A simple matter of taste and common sense.

430
00:42:01,387 --> 00:42:04,008
I cannot think of anyone better than you.

431
00:42:16,982 --> 00:42:22,049
Gentlemen. Please, don't get up.
The president sends his apologies.

432
00:42:22,153 --> 00:42:27,822
He's been called away at short notice
and he's asked me to step in.

433
00:42:28,324 --> 00:42:32,902
- And you are?
- Nicholas Garrigan. His doctor.

434
00:42:33,495 --> 00:42:35,701
- His doctor?
- Yes.

435
00:42:36,748 --> 00:42:40,230
- And you are?
- I'm the Austrian foreign minister.

436
00:42:40,334 --> 00:42:43,190
This is Dr Rommel,
one of our leading architects,

437
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:46,776
and Dr Bruner
from the institute of civil engineering.

438
00:42:46,881 --> 00:42:49,904
Together, we are the first bid.

439
00:42:50,008 --> 00:42:52,130
Bid, right.

440
00:42:53,135 --> 00:42:54,677
For what, precisely?

441
00:43:04,186 --> 00:43:06,959
I love it.

442
00:43:07,063 --> 00:43:10,545
Good choice. Modern, elegant.

443
00:43:10,649 --> 00:43:13,047
A symbol of Uganda's future.

444
00:43:13,151 --> 00:43:16,675
Here is where we will have
the next Pan-African Congress.

445
00:43:16,779 --> 00:43:20,678
- Nice.
- My two closest advisers.

446
00:43:20,782 --> 00:43:23,782
Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

447
00:43:26,161 --> 00:43:29,184
- Look what Nicholas has designed for me.
- Nice.

448
00:43:29,288 --> 00:43:32,312
- I didn't design anything. It was...
- Nonsense.

449
00:43:32,416 --> 00:43:35,064
You have a wonderful eye.

450
00:43:35,168 --> 00:43:38,692
Jonah, he has no taste.

451
00:43:38,796 --> 00:43:40,943
Look at him.

452
00:43:41,048 --> 00:43:43,404
Even his suits, they look silly.

453
00:43:43,508 --> 00:43:45,796
Is that not right, Jonah?

454
00:43:55,267 --> 00:44:01,167
- What is it you want, Jonah?
- I have ministerial papers for your signature.

455
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:04,355
Go. I will sign them later.

456
00:44:13,281 --> 00:44:16,483
I do not like the way that man looks at me.

457
00:44:17,534 --> 00:44:21,100
- Do you think he looks at me strangely?
- No.

458
00:44:21,204 --> 00:44:23,694
No, I can't say that I've noticed.

459
00:44:24,707 --> 00:44:27,104
OK, enlargement of the mediastinum

460
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:31,358
and reticulonodular lung patterns
all indicating pulmonary TB.

461
00:44:31,462 --> 00:44:33,703
Yeah, but it could be...

462
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,957
What was that?

463
00:44:55,856 --> 00:45:00,647
Makindye prison,
where Obote's people are being held.

464
00:45:01,777 --> 00:45:03,935
Can you hear that?

465
00:45:04,988 --> 00:45:07,886
Dr Garrigan. Dr Garrigan.

466
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:11,608
Please come quickly.
The president's son is sick.

467
00:45:12,702 --> 00:45:17,078
What's wrong with him?
What's wrong with him?

468
00:45:21,876 --> 00:45:26,025
Can you hear me, child?
I'm begging you to stop it, Mackenzie.

469
00:45:26,129 --> 00:45:30,111
- OK. Thank you. You can step away.
- Stop it, Mackenzie, please.

470
00:45:30,216 --> 00:45:32,530
- Hi. Your son's epileptic?
- I don't know.

471
00:45:32,634 --> 00:45:35,407
- What? Has he been like this before, then?
- Yes.

472
00:45:35,512 --> 00:45:40,536
Right, OK. Can you hold his knees up
against his chest? The other hand back here.

473
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,163
- This is Campbell?
- This is Mackenzie.

474
00:45:43,268 --> 00:45:45,665
Mackenzie. Right.

475
00:45:45,769 --> 00:45:48,959
Mackenzie, I am Dr Garrigan, OK?

476
00:45:49,064 --> 00:45:51,962
We're gonna sort you out.
We'll get you to hospital.

477
00:45:52,066 --> 00:45:56,465
No, no. The president will not allow it.
You must do what you can do from here.

478
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:59,321
- The child has to go to hospital.
- Please.

479
00:46:00,448 --> 00:46:02,239
Please.

480
00:46:03,241 --> 00:46:05,814
It's OK. Mamma's here.

481
00:46:06,536 --> 00:46:10,184
Mamma's here. It's OK. Mamma's here.

482
00:46:10,289 --> 00:46:12,895
OK. OK.

483
00:46:12,999 --> 00:46:15,075
There you are. OK.

484
00:46:16,126 --> 00:46:19,108
- There we are.
- Thank you. Thank you, Doctor.

485
00:46:19,212 --> 00:46:21,318
I thought I was losing him.

486
00:46:21,422 --> 00:46:23,747
It's OK. He's gonna be fine.

487
00:46:26,301 --> 00:46:29,467
Could you move the toys
from that bed, please?

488
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:32,798
Could you move the toys
from that bed, please?

489
00:46:41,563 --> 00:46:43,502
Big boy.

490
00:46:43,606 --> 00:46:46,357
Big boy. Here we go.

491
00:46:50,069 --> 00:46:54,594
- OK, baby. I'm so sorry. Sorry.
- It's OK. Don't say sorry.

492
00:46:54,698 --> 00:46:57,023
Don't say sorry.

493
00:46:57,992 --> 00:47:00,140
- So this is where you live?
- Yes.

494
00:47:00,244 --> 00:47:02,308
Why not stay with the other wives?

495
00:47:02,412 --> 00:47:07,479
Since I had Mackenzie, my husband
prefers us to be somewhere more private.

496
00:47:07,583 --> 00:47:10,314
This is ridiculous.

497
00:47:10,419 --> 00:47:16,319
I think your child has epilepsy.
It's a perfectly treatable condition.

498
00:47:16,423 --> 00:47:21,629
- The president does visit you here?
- He visits the children, not me.

499
00:47:22,511 --> 00:47:25,346
I'm a bad omen.

500
00:47:28,766 --> 00:47:30,455
OK.

501
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:35,834
I'm gonna make an appointment
for Mackenzie at the hospital. All right?

502
00:47:35,938 --> 00:47:40,516
I will tell the president
how helpful you have been.

503
00:48:59,879 --> 00:49:01,943
Morning, Nicholas.

504
00:49:02,047 --> 00:49:06,029
I could not go
without thanking you for helping my son.

505
00:49:06,133 --> 00:49:09,632
- Don't mention it.
- I bring you a small gift.

506
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:16,012
No doctor should be without his ambulance.

507
00:49:17,392 --> 00:49:21,341
- For me?
- Yes, come, come. This is yours here.

508
00:49:25,023 --> 00:49:28,880
- What do you think?
- Are you serious? It's a fantastic gift.

509
00:49:28,985 --> 00:49:34,843
Are you happy now? Let's try it. Drive me to
the airport. I have to fly to Libya on business.

510
00:49:34,947 --> 00:49:38,304
- Don't you think I should get dressed?
- Quickly. Quickly.

511
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:41,056
- Now?
- Yes.

512
00:49:41,161 --> 00:49:43,236
I'll just be a minute.

513
00:49:50,209 --> 00:49:54,586
- Are you comfortable here?
- Very much, thank you.

514
00:50:03,303 --> 00:50:06,826
So it was Obote's men
who attacked the prison, yeah?

515
00:50:06,931 --> 00:50:08,911
- Yes.
- Right.

516
00:50:09,016 --> 00:50:13,373
We heard the gunfire
all the way at the hospital.

517
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:19,503
- Yes. My soldiers, they held them off.
- We thought there'd be lots of casualties.

518
00:50:19,607 --> 00:50:24,507
Do you want to drive your car? I want
to see you drive your car. Please. Come.

519
00:50:24,611 --> 00:50:26,568
- Come.
- OK.

520
00:50:36,787 --> 00:50:41,282
So, you do not like the way I treat my son.

521
00:50:42,834 --> 00:50:45,406
No. No, I don't.

522
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:49,735
Hiding him away like that, it's ruining his life.

523
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:55,156
- That boy has everything he wants.
- Except the treatment that could save him.

524
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,991
He has comfort, a luxury life.

525
00:50:58,095 --> 00:51:01,494
Money, sir, is no substitute for anything.

526
00:51:01,598 --> 00:51:05,465
Nicholas, you have never been poor.

527
00:51:06,936 --> 00:51:09,000
What about Kay? Don't you think...?

528
00:51:09,104 --> 00:51:13,267
Do not speak about things
you do not understand.

529
00:51:16,735 --> 00:51:21,343
But the way you are concerned,
it has touched me

530
00:51:21,447 --> 00:51:24,345
and I will consider.

531
00:51:24,449 --> 00:51:28,682
You know, I like this type
of frank conversation.

532
00:51:28,786 --> 00:51:33,530
Yes, I respect your honesty
and your opinion completely.

533
00:51:42,004 --> 00:51:44,080
Drive. Drive.

534
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:50,718
Drive past. Drive.

535
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:56,550
Drive.

536
00:52:15,739 --> 00:52:18,526
Obote's men. I'm sure of it.

537
00:52:19,283 --> 00:52:22,319
If I had not been in your car...

538
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:27,144
It is in my dream. They cannot kill me.

539
00:52:27,248 --> 00:52:29,324
It is in my dream.

540
00:52:34,795 --> 00:52:38,211
Somebody told his men my travel plans.

541
00:52:39,591 --> 00:52:42,128
Somebody has betrayed me.

542
00:52:43,052 --> 00:52:45,886
I cannot trust anybody.

543
00:52:47,013 --> 00:52:49,586
I'm surrounded by traitors.

544
00:52:58,522 --> 00:53:01,060
Masanga.

545
00:53:01,942 --> 00:53:04,183
Nicholas. Nicholas.

546
00:53:04,735 --> 00:53:06,966
You know Masanga.

547
00:53:07,071 --> 00:53:09,427
He is one of my people.

548
00:53:09,531 --> 00:53:13,680
He will handle
all of my security matters from now on.

549
00:53:13,784 --> 00:53:15,306
Yes, sir.

550
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:20,534
- You will take care of me and this country.
- Yes, sir.

551
00:53:22,874 --> 00:53:25,022
Where is Jonah Wasswa?

552
00:53:25,126 --> 00:53:28,900
Where is he? I need my minister.

553
00:53:29,004 --> 00:53:34,071
A minister should be by his president's side.

554
00:53:34,175 --> 00:53:36,926
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

555
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:42,927
And you call yourself my closest adviser.

556
00:53:54,399 --> 00:54:00,767
You see? You see? These loyal soldiers,
already they have captured the criminals.

557
00:54:26,591 --> 00:54:29,322
Do not pity them, Nicholas.

558
00:54:29,426 --> 00:54:33,553
These men here, they wanted you dead.

559
00:54:36,432 --> 00:54:39,764
Why did you try to kill me?

560
00:54:42,645 --> 00:54:46,891
I will not die until I say.

561
00:54:49,942 --> 00:54:52,018
Look at me.

562
00:55:03,161 --> 00:55:06,280
You work for him. Obote.

563
00:55:07,831 --> 00:55:12,105
That drunk, silly man.

564
00:55:12,209 --> 00:55:16,289
You want to kill me for that drunk, silly man?

565
00:55:23,718 --> 00:55:26,007
Uganda loves me

566
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:30,216
because I am loyal

567
00:55:31,266 --> 00:55:34,136
and I am fair.

568
00:55:37,562 --> 00:55:41,262
I am your president.

569
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:54,776
Come, Nicholas. This is no place for us.

570
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:48,810
These, I can read you later. And the rest,
that's just pro forma papers for you to sign.

571
00:57:48,914 --> 00:57:55,165
I've left a small list of medical equipment
at the end for my old surgery in Mogambo.

572
00:58:04,718 --> 00:58:07,043
Is there anything else, Nicholas?

573
00:58:17,395 --> 00:58:19,683
Nicholas.

574
00:58:20,522 --> 00:58:23,013
It's probably nothing, sir.

575
00:58:27,111 --> 00:58:28,984
What?

576
00:58:32,365 --> 00:58:34,637
Nicholas,

577
00:58:34,742 --> 00:58:38,599
you are my closest adviser.

578
00:58:38,703 --> 00:58:42,652
Please, tell me what is on your mind.

579
00:58:50,129 --> 00:58:54,588
Last night, I went to the Holiday Inn
and had a drink.

580
00:58:55,716 --> 00:59:00,824
And I saw Jonah Wasswa there
speaking to some white guy in the bar.

581
00:59:00,929 --> 00:59:04,869
Something about it just didn't seem right.

582
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:07,621
It's probably nothing,

583
00:59:07,726 --> 00:59:10,207
but you might wanna have a talk with him.

584
00:59:10,311 --> 00:59:12,801
Just a talk.

585
00:59:15,857 --> 00:59:18,727
Like I say, it's probably nothing.

586
00:59:25,489 --> 00:59:28,241
Good night, sir.

587
00:59:51,426 --> 00:59:54,741
- How are you?
- Very well. How are you?

588
00:59:54,846 --> 00:59:56,921
I'm very well.

589
01:00:02,894 --> 01:00:05,680
That is very good, Mackenzie.

590
01:00:10,691 --> 01:00:14,273
- Very good. Go show your brother.
- OK.

591
01:00:19,114 --> 01:00:21,154
Hiya.

592
01:00:23,868 --> 01:00:25,944
Hi, ya.

593
01:00:29,289 --> 01:00:31,478
He's looking much better.

594
01:00:31,582 --> 01:00:34,522
Much better.

595
01:00:34,626 --> 01:00:39,568
That other one is Campbell.
He is the one who got your T-shirt.

596
01:00:39,672 --> 01:00:42,542
You're a man of taste.

597
01:00:44,009 --> 01:00:46,073
Mummy. Mummy.

598
01:00:46,177 --> 01:00:49,075
- Please. Goodbye.
- OK.

599
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:52,078
- He keeps pushing me, Mummy.
- OK, stop it.

600
01:00:52,182 --> 01:00:54,413
Stop it, Mackenzie.

601
01:00:54,517 --> 01:00:56,509
Garrigan.

602
01:00:57,895 --> 01:01:02,555
- Daydreaming?
- Looking at you, Stone, I hope so.

603
01:01:03,566 --> 01:01:07,590
I thought you'd be with the president
on his trip to London.

604
01:01:07,694 --> 01:01:12,593
- No. I'm needed here.
- I do hope the man hasn't blown up again.

605
01:01:12,698 --> 01:01:15,554
- What?
- I was reading this article in the <i>Times</i>.

606
01:01:15,658 --> 01:01:21,600
I don't know if you've seen it. It seems ajudge
who ruled against Amin has gone missing.

607
01:01:21,705 --> 01:01:26,271
- He hasn't been seen for five days.
- I'm sure there's a logical explanation.

608
01:01:26,375 --> 01:01:31,608
The thing is, we've been getting reports
up and down the country of the same thing -

609
01:01:31,713 --> 01:01:34,902
people speaking out against the regime

610
01:01:35,007 --> 01:01:37,696
just disappearing.

611
01:01:37,801 --> 01:01:41,491
No. If you're gonna accuse the president,
just come out and say it.

612
01:01:41,595 --> 01:01:45,953
I was just hoping you might be able to
give us a little clarification.

613
01:01:46,057 --> 01:01:49,924
Fuck your clarifications, Stone. Fuck them.

614
01:01:50,977 --> 01:01:53,208
You people amaze me, you know.

615
01:01:53,313 --> 01:01:57,712
The first sign of an independent leader
achieving something, what do you do?

616
01:01:57,816 --> 01:02:02,340
You spit your dummy because you can't
stand the idea that he's done it without you.

617
01:02:02,445 --> 01:02:05,051
I know he's a bit rough,
but what do you expect?

618
01:02:05,155 --> 01:02:10,263
Do you think Obote's people
are sitting around waiting for clarifications?

619
01:02:10,368 --> 01:02:12,473
Look at me.

620
01:02:12,578 --> 01:02:16,101
This is Africa.
You meet violence with violence.

621
01:02:16,205 --> 01:02:18,577
Anything else and you're dead.

622
01:02:19,625 --> 01:02:22,606
Then perhaps you'd be so kind
as to explain to me

623
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:26,542
the whereabouts of Health Minister Wasswa.

624
01:02:27,881 --> 01:02:29,862
What?

625
01:02:29,966 --> 01:02:32,906
Well, he's missing, too.

626
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:37,826
But, as you say, I'm sure
there's some perfectly normal explanation.

627
01:02:37,931 --> 01:02:43,581
I'm having drinks later
with the man who wrote the article.

628
01:02:43,685 --> 01:02:48,710
Perhaps you'd like to join us,
shed some light on the matter.

629
01:02:48,814 --> 01:02:51,351
- Fine. I will.
- About six o'clockish?

630
01:02:58,196 --> 01:03:00,386
- Can I help?
- I need to see the minister.

631
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:03,063
I'm afraid she's busy.

632
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:23,529
You were right.

633
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:26,239
The health minister has gone missing.

634
01:03:26,343 --> 01:03:31,743
- Apparently, he's fled to Tanzania.
- What? Jonah Wasswa?

635
01:03:31,847 --> 01:03:35,663
He's embezzled several
hundred thousand pounds of ministry funds.

636
01:03:35,767 --> 01:03:40,000
Some people are suggesting
that he's joined up with Obote's exiles.

637
01:03:40,104 --> 01:03:45,773
- I find that very hard to believe.
- He was sealing a major pharmaceutical deal.

638
01:03:47,234 --> 01:03:50,341
Life-saving penicillin for the masses.

639
01:03:50,445 --> 01:03:54,845
I should know. I set up the meeting
with his South African counterpart

640
01:03:54,949 --> 01:03:58,151
at the Holiday Inn.

641
01:04:00,453 --> 01:04:02,809
So, this embezzlement,

642
01:04:02,913 --> 01:04:05,770
is it on the record?

643
01:04:05,874 --> 01:04:10,037
- Yes. Yes, it is.
- And I can quote you in the paper?

644
01:04:11,211 --> 01:04:14,193
- I'm sorry, quote me?
- Not directly, of course.

645
01:04:14,297 --> 01:04:16,403
As a government spokesman.

646
01:04:16,507 --> 01:04:19,238
Government spokesman?

647
01:04:19,343 --> 01:04:20,837
OK.

648
01:05:02,001 --> 01:05:04,076
Mr President.

649
01:05:05,587 --> 01:05:08,277
I've come to say goodbye.

650
01:05:08,381 --> 01:05:10,752
I'm going home.

651
01:05:11,967 --> 01:05:13,840
Mr President.

652
01:05:19,389 --> 01:05:21,796
I got you. I got him.

653
01:05:23,809 --> 01:05:27,958
Nicholas, meet my body double, Muyenga.

654
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:31,753
Look at him. Everything the same, except...

655
01:05:31,857 --> 01:05:36,090
What do you say, Nicholas?
Is he as handsome as me?

656
01:05:36,194 --> 01:05:39,009
- No. No he's not.
- You see?

657
01:05:39,113 --> 01:05:44,070
You see? Nicholas agrees.
You are much more ugly than me, Muyenga.

658
01:05:46,535 --> 01:05:50,351
Look. Look, Nicholas. I have others also.

659
01:05:50,455 --> 01:05:55,994
All part of Captain Masanga's plan
for my security.

660
01:05:58,128 --> 01:06:01,045
- Clever.
- Yep.

661
01:06:16,267 --> 01:06:18,176
Nicholas.

662
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:24,352
My Nicholas.

663
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:32,193
What is all this about your going home?

664
01:06:39,785 --> 01:06:46,478
You once told me that you respected me
because I wasn't afraid to speak my mind.

665
01:06:46,582 --> 01:06:48,658
Speak.

666
01:06:52,128 --> 01:06:54,701
It's this business with Wasswa.

667
01:06:56,215 --> 01:06:57,903
I can't.

668
01:06:58,008 --> 01:07:04,700
It fucking stinks. I can't help going back to
that moment when I asked you to talk to him.

669
01:07:04,805 --> 01:07:06,869
This isn't me.

670
01:07:06,973 --> 01:07:09,954
I have to go home now.

671
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:12,832
You cannot.

672
01:07:12,936 --> 01:07:17,752
- What?
- Your work is not finished here yet.

673
01:07:17,856 --> 01:07:20,754
But I didn't come here to finish anything.

674
01:07:20,859 --> 01:07:25,466
You promised to me
that you would help to build a new Uganda.

675
01:07:25,571 --> 01:07:28,177
You swore an oath.

676
01:07:28,281 --> 01:07:33,181
The oath is a doctor's oath of confidentiality.
We all take it.

677
01:07:33,285 --> 01:07:37,726
- It's got nothing to do with Uganda.
- Nothing?

678
01:07:37,830 --> 01:07:40,665
Nothing comes from nothing.

679
01:07:41,708 --> 01:07:45,232
You have a conscience. I know you do.

680
01:07:45,336 --> 01:07:49,000
That is why you came here in the first place.

681
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:52,377
Or are you like all the other British?

682
01:07:53,926 --> 01:07:58,617
Just here to fuck and to take away?

683
01:07:58,721 --> 01:08:00,464
No.

684
01:08:01,515 --> 01:08:03,454
No.

685
01:08:03,559 --> 01:08:07,602
Why else would I trust you with my family?

686
01:08:10,230 --> 01:08:14,808
You are like my own son.

687
01:08:17,569 --> 01:08:20,217
I'm Nicholas Garrigan.

688
01:08:20,322 --> 01:08:23,595
And I'm from Scotland.
It's my home. I want to...

689
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:26,818
Your home is here.

690
01:08:27,452 --> 01:08:30,225
Please. Just... Please.

691
01:08:30,329 --> 01:08:32,487
Do not be a silly boy.

692
01:08:33,415 --> 01:08:38,574
If you go now, what will they think
about you and Jonah Wasswa?

693
01:08:39,586 --> 01:08:43,652
What are you talking about? I said talk to him.

694
01:08:43,756 --> 01:08:47,905
Do not pretend to yourself
that you did not know.

695
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:51,010
You are a stronger man than that.

696
01:08:52,722 --> 01:08:55,390
I didn't want him to die, though.

697
01:08:57,058 --> 01:09:00,177
But you did it.

698
01:09:02,688 --> 01:09:06,086
Why? You want to know why?

699
01:09:06,190 --> 01:09:07,963
You did it

700
01:09:08,067 --> 01:09:12,230
because you love me.

701
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:19,157
You have stepped
deep into the heart of my country.

702
01:09:20,785 --> 01:09:22,861
Uganda.

703
01:09:23,913 --> 01:09:27,281
Uganda embraces you.

704
01:09:34,254 --> 01:09:35,878
Nicholas.

705
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:37,832
Nicholas.

706
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:42,049
What you need is to have some fun.

707
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:16,474
Hey, Nicholas. Where have you been?

708
01:10:16,578 --> 01:10:19,185
I want you to meet Betty.

709
01:10:19,289 --> 01:10:22,740
And this here is her sister Joy.

710
01:10:23,959 --> 01:10:27,441
Joy is going to look after you this weekend.

711
01:10:27,545 --> 01:10:29,621
Joy.

712
01:10:30,756 --> 01:10:32,737
- Hi.
- Hi.

713
01:10:32,841 --> 01:10:36,340
And now, let the games begin.

714
01:10:43,057 --> 01:10:46,888
Nicholas, you didn't know
we had Ugandan cowboys.

715
01:10:48,061 --> 01:10:50,350
Finance minister.

716
01:10:55,442 --> 01:10:57,979
Come here.

717
01:11:36,974 --> 01:11:39,547
Can I have another whisky, please?

718
01:11:47,482 --> 01:11:51,693
Let me tell you, Nicholas,
you've chosen a fine life.

719
01:11:53,237 --> 01:11:57,068
You want to kill me for that drunk, silly man?

720
01:11:59,825 --> 01:12:01,734
Nicholas.

721
01:12:01,952 --> 01:12:03,825
Nicholas.

722
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:11,996
Dr Garrigan.

723
01:12:19,341 --> 01:12:23,005
Jesus fucking Christ, you look so lovely.

724
01:12:26,805 --> 01:12:29,661
You know something? I shouldn't be here.

725
01:12:29,765 --> 01:12:33,080
I should be in Scotland with my dad.

726
01:12:33,185 --> 01:12:38,626
I should be looking after little old ladies
cos here I've fucked up.

727
01:12:38,731 --> 01:12:41,268
Kay, I fucked up. I fucked up.

728
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,600
Not here.

729
01:12:46,778 --> 01:12:49,385
- Walk with me.
- What?

730
01:12:49,489 --> 01:12:51,564
Walk with me.

731
01:13:09,379 --> 01:13:12,111
I'm fucking doomed.

732
01:13:12,215 --> 01:13:16,698
Do you know he's got
go-go dancers after me now?

733
01:13:16,802 --> 01:13:18,949
Where are we going?

734
01:13:19,054 --> 01:13:21,910
I don't know.

735
01:13:22,014 --> 01:13:26,426
- Nicky.
- Shit. It's the go-go dancer.

736
01:13:29,145 --> 01:13:31,584
Through here. Come on.

737
01:13:31,688 --> 01:13:33,811
Just follow me.

738
01:13:52,038 --> 01:13:53,911
Fuck it.

739
01:14:51,834 --> 01:14:54,607
He has always been like this.

740
01:14:54,711 --> 01:14:57,914
He just chose not to show you until now.

741
01:15:01,925 --> 01:15:04,239
Nicholas.

742
01:15:04,344 --> 01:15:07,095
You have to find a way to get out.

743
01:15:07,971 --> 01:15:10,296
He still listens to me.

744
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:16,469
He cannot trust anybody any more.

745
01:15:18,563 --> 01:15:21,002
I'll wait, until things get really bad.

746
01:15:21,107 --> 01:15:23,087
They are.

747
01:15:23,192 --> 01:15:25,267
Really bad.

748
01:15:33,783 --> 01:15:35,526
- Nothing.
- What?

749
01:15:35,743 --> 01:15:38,150
- Nothing.
- What?

750
01:15:40,330 --> 01:15:46,581
I just had this mad image of me and you
sitting at my mother and father's dinner table.

751
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:53,079
"More stew, Mrs Amin?"

752
01:16:01,179 --> 01:16:03,410
Nicholas.

753
01:16:03,515 --> 01:16:06,266
You've got to get out.

754
01:16:10,937 --> 01:16:13,793
- What is going on?
- I don't know.

755
01:16:13,898 --> 01:16:17,017
What if somebody saw us?

756
01:16:19,986 --> 01:16:24,148
- Just wait two minutes and then come out.
- Yeah.

757
01:16:25,699 --> 01:16:27,774
Go. Go, go, go.

758
01:18:34,298 --> 01:18:36,006
Shit.

759
01:18:51,437 --> 01:18:53,376
Dr Garrigan.

760
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,836
It's four in the morning.

761
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:58,098
Can I have a word with you?

762
01:19:02,654 --> 01:19:04,812
- Whisky?
- OK.

763
01:19:12,912 --> 01:19:15,601
They've...

764
01:19:15,706 --> 01:19:18,492
they've taken my passport.

765
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:24,275
You were saying that
if there was ever anything you could do.

766
01:19:24,379 --> 01:19:27,048
I need to get out of here while I still can.

767
01:19:29,174 --> 01:19:32,740
I was hoping
you might be able to help in that.

768
01:19:32,844 --> 01:19:36,426
- Please.
- "Please." That's a nice touch.

769
01:19:39,307 --> 01:19:44,513
Have you any idea
what's going on in this country, Dr Garrigan?

770
01:19:45,562 --> 01:19:47,584
Some.

771
01:19:47,689 --> 01:19:51,087
In the countryside,
they're not even bothering to dig graves.

772
01:19:51,191 --> 01:19:55,215
They're simply feeding them
to the crocodiles.

773
01:19:55,320 --> 01:20:01,937
Right here in Kampala, right under our noses,
he's wiped out the entire political opposition.

774
01:20:02,784 --> 01:20:08,619
Thousands of Acholi and Langi tribesmen
from the army.

775
01:20:09,289 --> 01:20:12,906
He's hardly even bothering
to cover it up any more.

776
01:20:17,087 --> 01:20:19,873
Even members of his own cabinet.

777
01:20:21,256 --> 01:20:23,545
Your friend, the health minister.

778
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:35,580
This is a man who was actually
trying to help his country.

779
01:20:35,684 --> 01:20:39,349
Idi always seems to get it wrong, doesn't he?

780
01:20:40,897 --> 01:20:43,731
Jesus fucking Christ.

781
01:20:46,109 --> 01:20:48,423
Get me out of here.

782
01:20:48,528 --> 01:20:51,593
You earn your passage first.

783
01:20:51,697 --> 01:20:54,187
What?

784
01:20:56,784 --> 01:20:59,557
You know what they're calling you?

785
01:20:59,661 --> 01:21:02,615
His white monkey.

786
01:21:03,581 --> 01:21:06,437
I'm his doctor.

787
01:21:06,542 --> 01:21:10,107
- It's not my job to judge the man.
- "I'm his doctor."

788
01:21:10,211 --> 01:21:15,361
Is that your defence?
How pathetic. Fuck off, Garrigan.

789
01:21:15,465 --> 01:21:19,248
We don't just hand out passports
to chimps like you.

790
01:21:19,719 --> 01:21:24,785
Particularly not chimps
with blood on their hands.

791
01:21:24,889 --> 01:21:27,973
Look, you, I'm a citizen and I have rights.

792
01:21:29,017 --> 01:21:33,709
Fuck your rights.
You do as I say or you don't get out of here.

793
01:21:33,813 --> 01:21:38,587
You're his doctor.
You have unprecedented access to him.

794
01:21:38,692 --> 01:21:41,645
Obviously, we'd help you with...

795
01:21:43,612 --> 01:21:46,067
anything you needed.

796
01:21:48,157 --> 01:21:51,241
You want me to kill him?

797
01:22:32,358 --> 01:22:36,341
Amidst rumours of human-rights violations
and mismanagement,

798
01:22:36,445 --> 01:22:41,428
the situation in Uganda
has deteriorated badly in recent months.

799
01:22:41,532 --> 01:22:46,987
...ten new hospitals has had to be
deferred and all the rest of those...

800
01:22:48,621 --> 01:22:52,520
Getting any definite information
from the country has become harder.

801
01:22:52,624 --> 01:22:56,731
...has accused the British
of attempting to assassinate him.

802
01:22:56,836 --> 01:23:00,151
...and so his policies
are growing ever more unpredictable.

803
01:23:00,255 --> 01:23:04,418
The British government
has broken its promises to Uganda.

804
01:23:05,134 --> 01:23:11,799
Because of this, I have decided
to expel all Asians from this country.

805
01:23:12,139 --> 01:23:14,594
And these people, they are leeches.

806
01:23:15,183 --> 01:23:19,761
They milk the cow,
but they do not want to feed the cow.

807
01:23:20,229 --> 01:23:23,846
No longer. They have 90 days to leave.

808
01:23:30,445 --> 01:23:33,280
They are too sick to leave.

809
01:23:36,158 --> 01:23:40,515
Take your hands off him.
This is a sick man. How dare you?

810
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:45,186
I don't care where you get your orders from.
You cannot come into a hospital...

811
01:23:45,290 --> 01:23:48,243
They're forcing our sick relatives to leave.

812
01:24:02,762 --> 01:24:04,909
This is a hospital.

813
01:24:05,014 --> 01:24:07,930
You get your men out of here now.

814
01:24:24,570 --> 01:24:27,571
I'm complaining personally to the president.

815
01:24:28,031 --> 01:24:30,700
You all right?

816
01:24:34,203 --> 01:24:36,267
I'll see to this.

817
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:41,980
You're trying to help your people,
I understand that, but Uganda isn't ready, sir.

818
01:24:42,084 --> 01:24:45,357
You expel the Asians now,
this economy will be on its knees,

819
01:24:45,462 --> 01:24:51,237
not to mention the damage you'll do
to your reputation abroad.

820
01:24:51,341 --> 01:24:55,124
Is that what you came here for?

821
01:24:56,303 --> 01:25:01,213
To plead for your fucking Asian tailor?

822
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:05,434
These things do not concern you.

823
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:09,751
You are nothing but a doctor.

824
01:25:09,856 --> 01:25:12,560
You are a nobody.

825
01:25:15,985 --> 01:25:18,061
Get out.

826
01:25:19,155 --> 01:25:21,230
Get out.

827
01:25:48,761 --> 01:25:50,753
Sarah.

828
01:25:50,971 --> 01:25:52,346
Sarah.

829
01:26:15,490 --> 01:26:17,566
Hello.

830
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:23,350
- What have we done?
- Who...? Kay, is that you?

831
01:26:23,454 --> 01:26:28,199
He is going to kill us, Nicholas.
He is going to kill us.

832
01:26:30,126 --> 01:26:33,376
I have to get it out of me.

833
01:26:33,963 --> 01:26:37,111
He will kill me, Nicholas.

834
01:26:37,215 --> 01:26:39,836
I have to get it out.

835
01:26:41,927 --> 01:26:45,177
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know.

836
01:26:47,473 --> 01:26:52,456
I want you to do it. Please.
You're a doctor. I know you can do it.

837
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,584
- I know you can do it, Nicholas.
- No, we can't.

838
01:26:55,688 --> 01:26:58,605
I can't do that.

839
01:27:00,108 --> 01:27:04,632
This isn't some simple procedure.
It has to be done under clinical conditions.

840
01:27:04,737 --> 01:27:07,301
I have to...

841
01:27:07,405 --> 01:27:11,554
If you don't do something now,
I'm going to have to find a place to go.

842
01:27:11,659 --> 01:27:15,266
I'll have to get it done in one of the villages.
Is that what you want?

843
01:27:15,370 --> 01:27:17,476
No, you don't.

844
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:23,439
Come here. Whatever you do,
you don't do that. All right?

845
01:27:23,543 --> 01:27:26,733
I'm gonna sort something out.

846
01:27:26,837 --> 01:27:29,790
Promise me you'll stay in the house.

847
01:27:30,924 --> 01:27:34,043
Please promise me you'll stay in the house.

848
01:27:38,388 --> 01:27:41,244
Promise me this...

849
01:27:41,348 --> 01:27:44,080
promise this is going to be all right.

850
01:27:44,184 --> 01:27:45,998
I promise.

851
01:27:46,102 --> 01:27:48,675
We'll do it first thing in the morning.

852
01:27:50,397 --> 01:27:52,836
Kay Amin?

853
01:27:52,941 --> 01:27:55,513
- The president's wife?
- Yes.

854
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:02,385
- No. We couldn't do that here, not at Mulago.
- Why not?

855
01:28:02,490 --> 01:28:05,846
It's the president's hospital.
He's bound to find out.

856
01:28:05,951 --> 01:28:08,572
- We could do this discreetly.
- No.

857
01:28:10,538 --> 01:28:13,186
He would kill her and us.

858
01:28:13,290 --> 01:28:16,313
- It's too much to risk.
- What choice does she have?

859
01:28:16,417 --> 01:28:19,857
Some backstreet job in a village somewhere?

860
01:28:19,962 --> 01:28:23,485
Come on, Thomas.
You know what that means.

861
01:28:23,589 --> 01:28:27,289
It's the only choice you've left her.

862
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:32,659
But I don't expect
it crossed your mind to wonder.

863
01:28:32,763 --> 01:28:35,929
A white man with a black woman.

864
01:28:37,183 --> 01:28:40,516
What does she need with such things?

865
01:28:41,687 --> 01:28:43,417
Fine.

866
01:28:43,522 --> 01:28:45,727
I'll do it myself.

867
01:28:58,492 --> 01:29:02,440
The president wants to see you. Now.

868
01:29:21,051 --> 01:29:23,824
My head is exploding.

869
01:29:23,928 --> 01:29:29,036
I can't think. I can't sleep.
Look at this. Look at this.

870
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:33,498
The British newspapers say I am a madman.

871
01:29:33,602 --> 01:29:38,168
The American newspapers
say I am a cannibal.

872
01:29:38,272 --> 01:29:40,962
I am a cannibal?

873
01:29:41,066 --> 01:29:45,382
These are lies.
I should throw them out for good.

874
01:29:45,486 --> 01:29:47,967
Only Ugandan press from now on.

875
01:29:48,072 --> 01:29:50,386
- You want something for the headache?
- No.

876
01:29:50,490 --> 01:29:56,099
- Something to help you sleep, perhaps?
- Later. I want you to tell me what to do.

877
01:29:56,203 --> 01:30:00,269
- You want me to tell you what to do?
- Yes. You are my adviser.

878
01:30:00,373 --> 01:30:03,480
You are the only one I can trust in here.

879
01:30:03,584 --> 01:30:07,483
You should've told me
not to throw the Asians out in the first place.

880
01:30:07,587 --> 01:30:11,027
- I did.
- But you did not persuade me, Nicholas.

881
01:30:11,131 --> 01:30:13,800
You did not persuade me.

882
01:30:18,429 --> 01:30:21,299
Tell me what to do here.

883
01:30:27,519 --> 01:30:33,638
Don't throw the journalists out.
They're only gonna write more lies about you.

884
01:30:34,691 --> 01:30:37,714
You invite them to meet you face to face.

885
01:30:37,819 --> 01:30:39,894
You charm them.

886
01:30:42,906 --> 01:30:46,405
You show them what kind of a man you are.

887
01:30:53,873 --> 01:30:56,479
You think this will work?

888
01:30:56,583 --> 01:30:59,702
I think that's the Amin they need to see.

889
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:04,569
Thank you.

890
01:31:04,673 --> 01:31:07,128
Thank you very much, Nicholas.

891
01:31:08,176 --> 01:31:10,547
What would I do without my Nicholas?

892
01:31:10,761 --> 01:31:13,430
What would I do without my Nicholas?

893
01:31:19,685 --> 01:31:22,009
Is there something going on here?

894
01:31:23,271 --> 01:31:25,761
No. No.

895
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:31,339
No.

896
01:31:31,444 --> 01:31:34,342
- Is there?
- No.

897
01:31:34,446 --> 01:31:36,135
No.

898
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:39,156
- Are you sure, Nicholas?
- Yes.

899
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:42,193
Yes.

900
01:31:45,830 --> 01:31:49,992
Give me a booster,
something to make me feel strong again.

901
01:32:16,312 --> 01:32:18,001
Sir.

902
01:32:18,105 --> 01:32:23,893
- Where are you going, Nicholas?
- I have something that I have to attend to.

903
01:32:24,944 --> 01:32:26,591
No.

904
01:32:26,695 --> 01:32:31,688
You have to stay here.
I need you for the press conference.

905
01:32:42,666 --> 01:32:47,315
This is all very well, your Excellency,
but what about the reports of mass killings?

906
01:32:47,419 --> 01:32:51,318
Who have you been talking with?
The British?

907
01:32:51,422 --> 01:32:56,280
Go. Look around Uganda for missing people.
Go anywhere you please.

908
01:32:56,385 --> 01:32:59,919
So, why would the British
spread these rumours?

909
01:33:03,432 --> 01:33:06,330
Because they hate me.

910
01:33:06,434 --> 01:33:10,667
Because I refuse to recognise South Africa,

911
01:33:10,771 --> 01:33:14,419
a racist regime that they support.

912
01:33:14,524 --> 01:33:18,214
- Also, they are jealous of me.
- Why?

913
01:33:18,318 --> 01:33:22,634
Because while they are starving
with their strikes and with their protests,

914
01:33:22,738 --> 01:33:28,158
the people of Uganda
are eating beef and driving big cars.

915
01:33:30,119 --> 01:33:35,436
I have created the Save Britain Fund.

916
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:39,397
We Ugandans, we like to help friends,
so the Ugandans have got together

917
01:33:39,501 --> 01:33:43,400
and saved three tons of food and vegetables

918
01:33:43,505 --> 01:33:46,278
for their friends in England.

919
01:33:46,382 --> 01:33:52,383
Because they are having
economic difficulties, let me assure you here.

920
01:34:04,479 --> 01:34:06,353
Kay.

921
01:34:06,564 --> 01:34:08,437
Kay.

922
01:34:10,025 --> 01:34:12,101
Kay, it's OK. It's Nick.

923
01:34:14,278 --> 01:34:17,135
- What?
- I'm sorry.

924
01:34:17,239 --> 01:34:19,315
She went to the village.

925
01:34:19,783 --> 01:34:22,736
They had to take her to hospital.

926
01:34:25,829 --> 01:34:30,645
It's been reported that you crowned yourself
the last king of Scotland.

927
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:36,483
My good friends the Scottish people have
seen how I have defeated the English here

928
01:34:36,587 --> 01:34:40,750
and they want me
to do the same for them there.

929
01:34:48,263 --> 01:34:50,119
Yeah. This woman here.

930
01:34:50,223 --> 01:34:55,998
Did you write to the queen of England,
offering yourself as a lover?

931
01:34:56,103 --> 01:34:59,720
You are very cheeky.

932
01:35:55,899 --> 01:36:00,465
And this is what happens
when you betray the president.

933
01:36:00,569 --> 01:36:04,732
This is what happens when you betray him.

934
01:36:58,823 --> 01:37:05,026
I'm not. I enjoy it.
I could spend the rest of my life getting laid.

935
01:37:15,377 --> 01:37:19,955
There should be more to it
than a lot of little tingles.

936
01:37:33,808 --> 01:37:39,167
They say she has a clitoris
halfway down her throat.

937
01:37:39,271 --> 01:37:41,335
Is this possible?

938
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:43,515
Medically?

939
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:48,767
Almost all aberrations of nature are possible.

940
01:37:51,906 --> 01:37:55,680
I made an example of her

941
01:37:55,784 --> 01:37:58,274
because she betrayed me.

942
01:38:02,039 --> 01:38:05,687
I brought you those headache pills
that you asked for.

943
01:38:05,792 --> 01:38:07,867
Good.

944
01:38:10,504 --> 01:38:13,110
Is there anything else?

945
01:38:13,214 --> 01:38:15,787
No. No, that's all.

946
01:38:18,426 --> 01:38:20,949
Then go.

947
01:38:21,053 --> 01:38:23,295
We are busy here.

948
01:39:09,383 --> 01:39:11,707
Morning.

949
01:39:18,223 --> 01:39:20,954
Come on.

950
01:39:21,058 --> 01:39:23,665
- Shit.
- Hello? Yes.

951
01:39:23,769 --> 01:39:25,761
Come on.

952
01:39:26,229 --> 01:39:28,186
Yes, sir.

953
01:39:30,774 --> 01:39:34,882
Nicholas, there you are.
Were you trying to run away from me?

954
01:39:34,986 --> 01:39:37,061
No. No.

955
01:39:40,282 --> 01:39:45,181
I need you at the airport right away
to help me with the hostages.

956
01:39:45,286 --> 01:39:47,016
- Hostages?
- Yes.

957
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:51,811
An Air France aeroplane has been hijacked
by our Palestinian brothers.

958
01:39:51,916 --> 01:39:54,122
They have landed here at Entebbe.

959
01:39:55,210 --> 01:39:58,650
The eyes of the world are on Uganda today.

960
01:39:58,754 --> 01:40:01,790
Come, Nicholas. To work.

961
01:40:18,645 --> 01:40:21,218
How many passengers?

962
01:40:21,689 --> 01:40:23,764
250?

963
01:40:24,524 --> 01:40:26,682
How many of them are Zionist?

964
01:40:28,944 --> 01:40:33,321
And television - plenty of television cameras.

965
01:40:37,785 --> 01:40:43,904
Please, tell them to take the hostages
to the terminal building.

966
01:41:00,636 --> 01:41:03,755
Mr President, the press is waiting for you, sir.

967
01:41:16,815 --> 01:41:22,340
I wanted to assure you that the hostages
will get the best medical care.

968
01:41:22,444 --> 01:41:25,113
I have made my own doctor available.

969
01:41:42,793 --> 01:41:45,233
Doctor. Doctor, what's the situation here?

970
01:41:45,337 --> 01:41:49,486
One woman with a heart condition
has gone to hospital, cases of shock,

971
01:41:49,590 --> 01:41:51,988
and we're giving malaria pills to everyone.

972
01:41:52,092 --> 01:41:54,615
- Who's not been seen by a doctor?
- We haven't.

973
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:58,384
OK, how many of you are there?

974
01:41:58,889 --> 01:42:03,467
- Yourself? You've not been seen yet?
- Malaria pills. How is everybody?

975
01:42:03,977 --> 01:42:05,885
Thank you very much.

976
01:42:07,771 --> 01:42:10,771
OK. OK, anybody else?

977
01:42:12,650 --> 01:42:18,853
OK. Take these three. The nurse
is gonna come round with water. Nurse.

978
01:42:20,072 --> 01:42:21,970
Thomas.

979
01:42:22,074 --> 01:42:26,486
Thomas, can you take these, please?
I'll be two minutes.

980
01:42:48,261 --> 01:42:50,253
No. Don't.

981
01:42:52,806 --> 01:42:54,882
Spit.

982
01:43:52,436 --> 01:43:54,594
Look at you.

983
01:43:56,606 --> 01:44:01,183
Is there one thing
you have done that is good?

984
01:44:03,903 --> 01:44:07,302
Did you think this was all a game?

985
01:44:07,406 --> 01:44:09,929
"I will go to Africa

986
01:44:10,033 --> 01:44:12,639
and I will play the white man

987
01:44:12,743 --> 01:44:14,901
with the natives."

988
01:44:16,455 --> 01:44:19,241
Is that what you thought?

989
01:44:19,832 --> 01:44:22,501
We are not a game, Nicholas.

990
01:44:24,377 --> 01:44:26,950
We are real.

991
01:44:27,963 --> 01:44:30,121
This room here,

992
01:44:31,216 --> 01:44:33,822
it is real.

993
01:44:33,926 --> 01:44:37,200
I think your death

994
01:44:37,304 --> 01:44:41,882
will be the first real thing
that has happened to you.

995
01:44:44,268 --> 01:44:46,499
Listen to me, Nicholas.

996
01:44:46,603 --> 01:44:49,126
Listen. I know.

997
01:44:49,230 --> 01:44:51,169
Yes.

998
01:44:51,273 --> 01:44:54,463
I know about you

999
01:44:54,567 --> 01:44:56,358
and Kay.

1000
01:44:59,196 --> 01:45:02,232
How could you do that to me?

1001
01:45:04,408 --> 01:45:08,641
I am the father of this nation, Nicholas,

1002
01:45:08,745 --> 01:45:14,331
and you have
most grossly offended your father.

1003
01:45:19,253 --> 01:45:21,495
You're a child.

1004
01:45:23,465 --> 01:45:26,833
That's what makes you so fucking scary.

1005
01:45:46,816 --> 01:45:48,892
In my village,

1006
01:45:49,944 --> 01:45:55,981
when you steal the wife of an elder,

1007
01:45:57,408 --> 01:45:59,889
they take you to a tree

1008
01:45:59,993 --> 01:46:02,531
and they hang you by your skin.

1009
01:46:03,579 --> 01:46:06,811
Each time you scream,

1010
01:46:06,915 --> 01:46:10,782
the evil comes out of you.

1011
01:46:13,420 --> 01:46:16,235
Sometimes it can take three days

1012
01:46:16,339 --> 01:46:20,502
for your evil to be spent.

1013
01:46:25,471 --> 01:46:27,594
Pull him up.

1014
01:48:37,532 --> 01:48:39,972
Good evening.

1015
01:48:40,076 --> 01:48:42,364
I have good news.

1016
01:48:43,412 --> 01:48:48,520
The Israeli government
has agreed to negotiate.

1017
01:48:48,624 --> 01:48:52,648
So, as a gesture of good faith,

1018
01:48:52,752 --> 01:48:57,295
all non-lsraeli hostages will be released.

1019
01:48:59,091 --> 01:49:05,341
I have arranged personally
an aeroplane to come and collect you.

1020
01:49:08,723 --> 01:49:10,300
Yes.

1021
01:49:26,946 --> 01:49:29,863
He'll be here when we come back.

1022
01:49:33,409 --> 01:49:35,567
This way, Israelis.

1023
01:49:51,757 --> 01:49:53,962
Israelis, here.

1024
01:50:22,489 --> 01:50:26,805
They have sent a plane.
They are releasing some of the hostages.

1025
01:50:26,909 --> 01:50:30,933
If you go now,
you will reach them before they leave.

1026
01:50:31,037 --> 01:50:33,278
Here, put this on.

1027
01:50:34,331 --> 01:50:36,869
Why are you doing this?

1028
01:50:37,917 --> 01:50:40,357
Frankly,

1029
01:50:40,461 --> 01:50:43,082
I don't know.

1030
01:50:45,006 --> 01:50:47,404
You deserve to die,

1031
01:50:47,508 --> 01:50:50,114
but dead, you can do nothing.

1032
01:50:50,219 --> 01:50:54,796
Alive, you might just be able
to redeem yourself.

1033
01:50:55,848 --> 01:50:58,136
I don't understand.

1034
01:50:59,392 --> 01:51:03,436
I am tired of hatred, Dr Garrigan.

1035
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:07,545
This country is drowning in it.

1036
01:51:07,649 --> 01:51:09,771
We deserve better.

1037
01:51:10,985 --> 01:51:14,934
Go home. Tell the world the truth about Amin.

1038
01:51:16,197 --> 01:51:18,928
They will believe you.

1039
01:51:19,033 --> 01:51:21,819
You are a white man.

1040
01:51:44,928 --> 01:51:48,660
- What about you?
- My fate is in God's hands.

1041
01:51:48,764 --> 01:51:51,255
Go. Now, before they come back.

1042
01:51:52,309 --> 01:51:55,123
- Thank you.
- Go.

1043
01:51:55,228 --> 01:51:57,184
Go.

1044
01:53:30,093 --> 01:53:32,782
Thomas.

1045
01:53:32,887 --> 01:53:34,511
Stop.

1046
01:53:36,473 --> 01:53:38,595
Where is the doctor?

1047
01:53:41,352 --> 01:53:43,308
I don't know.

1048
01:53:47,106 --> 01:53:48,766
Destination Paris.

1049
01:54:05,162 --> 01:54:07,913
My wife.

1050
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:21,362
There are many people
who have brokered relations with Israel.

1051
01:54:21,466 --> 01:54:27,717
They are not only Muslims,
they are also Christians. This particular...
