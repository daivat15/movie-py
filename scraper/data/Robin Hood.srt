1
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,286
You know, there's been a heap
of legends and tall tales...

2
00:00:39,355 --> 00:00:41,289
about Robin Hood.

3
00:00:41,357 --> 00:00:43,655
All different too.

4
00:00:43,727 --> 00:00:47,629
Well, we folks of the animal kingdom
have our own version.

5
00:00:47,697 --> 00:00:50,598
It's the story of what really happened
in Sherwood Forest.

6
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,656
Oh, incidentally,
I'm Allan-a-Dale, a minstrel.

7
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:40,635
That's an early-day folk singer.

8
00:03:40,703 --> 00:03:43,389
And my job is to...
tell it like it is.

9
00:03:43,522 --> 00:03:46,423
Or was or whatever.

10
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,962
Robin Hood and Little John
walkin' through the forest

11
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:55,795
Laughin' back and forth at
what the other'n has to say

12
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,305
Reminiscin' this 'n' that
and havin' such a good time

13
00:04:01,373 --> 00:04:04,809
Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally
Golly, what a day

14
00:04:07,446 --> 00:04:10,006
Never ever thinkin' there was
danger in the water

15
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:13,108
They were drinkin'
They just guzzled it down

16
00:04:13,185 --> 00:04:16,450
Never dreamin' that a schemin'
sheriff and his posse

17
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:20,720
Was a-watchin' them
and gatherin' around

18
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:24,285
Robin Hood and Little John
runnin' through the forest

19
00:04:24,363 --> 00:04:27,662
Jumpin' fences, dodgin' trees
and tryin' to get away

20
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:32,930
Contemplatin' nothin' but escapin'
and finally makin' it

21
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:35,405
Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally
Golly, what a day

22
00:04:37,609 --> 00:04:43,479
Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally
Golly, what a day

23
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:46,814
You know something, Robin?
You're taking too many chances.

24
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:49,979
Chances?
You must be joking.

25
00:04:50,055 --> 00:04:52,421
That was just a bit
of a lark, Little John.

26
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:55,153
Yeah?
Take a look at your hat.

27
00:04:55,227 --> 00:04:57,195
That's not
a candle on a cake.

28
00:04:57,262 --> 00:05:01,221
Hello. This one almost
had my name on it, didn't it?

29
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,165
They're getting better,
you know.

30
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:05,965
You've got to admit it.
They are getting better.

31
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:10,270
Huh, yeah. The next time
that sheriff'll probably
have a rope around our necks.

32
00:05:10,342 --> 00:05:13,834
Pretty hard to laugh
hangin' there, Rob.

33
00:05:13,912 --> 00:05:17,780
Ha! The sheriff and his whole posse
couldn't lift you off the ground.

34
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,911
- En garde!
- Hey, watch it, Rob.
That's the only hat I've got.

35
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:24,581
Oh, come along.
You worry too much, old boy.

36
00:05:24,656 --> 00:05:27,648
You know something, Robin?
I was just wonderin'.

37
00:05:27,726 --> 00:05:30,058
Are we good guys
or bad guys?

38
00:05:30,128 --> 00:05:34,087
You know. I mean, uh, our robbin'
the rich to feed the poor.

39
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,100
''Rob''?


40
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:38,227
That's a naughty word.
We never rob.

41
00:05:38,303 --> 00:05:42,205
We just... sort of borrow a bit
from those who can afford it.

42
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:45,801
Borrow? Huh.
Boy, are we in debt.

43
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:58,745
That sounds like another collection
day for the poor. Eh, Johnny boy?

44
00:05:58,824 --> 00:06:02,658
Yeah. Sweet charity.

45
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:40,795
Taxes!
Taxes!

46
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:45,530
Beautiful, lovely taxes!

47
00:06:45,604 --> 00:06:48,664
Sire, you have
an absolute skill...

48
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,607
for encouraging contributions
from the poor.

49
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,941
To coin a phrase,
my dear counselor,

50
00:06:54,012 --> 00:06:56,879
rob the poor
to feed the rich.

51
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:59,281
- Am I right?

52
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:03,720
Tell me, what is
the next stop, Sir Hiss?

53
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:05,723
Uh, let me see.
Uh, I--

54
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:09,056
Oh! Yes.
The next stop is Nottingham, sire.

55
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:12,028
Oh! The richest plum
of them all.

56
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:15,430
Notting--
ham.

57
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,970
A perfect fit, sire.
Most becoming.

58
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,635
You look regal, dignified,
sincere, masterful, noble, chival--

59
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,236
Uh, uh, don't,
don't overdo it, Hiss.

60
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:32,878
There. That,
I believe, does it.

61
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:38,548
This crown gives me
a feeling of power! Power!

62
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,889
Forgive me a cruel chuckle.

63
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,894
Power. Hmm.

64
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:48,422
And how well King Richard's crown
sits on your noble brow.

65
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,095
Doesn't it?
Uh, King Richard?

66
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:56,402
I've told you never
to mention my brother's name!

67
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:59,273
A-A mere slip of
the forked tongue, Your Majesty.

68
00:08:00,345 --> 00:08:03,542
We're in this plot together,
if you don't mind my saying so.

69
00:08:03,615 --> 00:08:06,550
And remember, it was your idea
I hypnotized him and--

70
00:08:06,618 --> 00:08:11,612
I know. And sent him
off on that crazy crusade.

71
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:17,184
Much to the sorrow
of the Queen Mother.

72
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:21,221
Yes! Mother.

73
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:24,427
Mother always did
like Richard best.

74
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:29,966
Your Highness,
please don't do that.

75
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,636
If you don't mind
my saying so, you see,

76
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:34,645
you have a very loud thumb.

77
00:08:36,882 --> 00:08:40,340
Hypnotism could rid you
of your... psychosis...

78
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,512
so...

79
00:08:42,587 --> 00:08:46,683
easily.

80
00:08:46,758 --> 00:08:48,919
No! None of that!
None of that.

81
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:51,827
- Well, I was only trying to help.

82
00:08:51,897 --> 00:08:54,832
I wonder.
Silly serpent.

83
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,494
- ''Silly serpent''?
- Now look here.

84
00:08:57,569 --> 00:09:01,938
One more hiss out of you,
Hiss,

85
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:05,170
and you are
walking to Nottingham.

86
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:08,906
Snakes don't walk.
They slither.

87
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,073
Hmpf. So there.

88
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:49,319
Now what about that for luck?
It's only a circus. A peanut operation.

89
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:52,788
''Peanuts''? Why, you dunce.
That's the royal coach.

90
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:55,554
- It's Prince John himself.
- The prince?

91
00:09:55,627 --> 00:09:57,993
Wait a minute.
There's a law against robbin' royalty.

92
00:09:58,063 --> 00:10:00,258
- I'll catch you later.
- What?

93
00:10:00,332 --> 00:10:03,301
And miss this chance
to perform before royalty?

94
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:06,634
Ah! Here we go again.

95
00:10:09,707 --> 00:10:11,641
Oo-de-lally!
Oo-de-lally!

96
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:13,643
Fortune-tellers!

97
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:16,544
Fortunes forecast!
Lucky charms!

98
00:10:16,614 --> 00:10:20,015
Get the dope
with your horoscope.

99
00:10:20,084 --> 00:10:23,315
Fortune-tellers! How droll.
Uh, stop the coach.

100
00:10:23,387 --> 00:10:26,151
Sire, sire,
they may be bandits.

101
00:10:26,223 --> 00:10:28,783
Oh, poppycock.
Female bandits?

102
00:10:28,859 --> 00:10:31,327
What next? Rubbish.

103
00:10:31,395 --> 00:10:34,796
Um, um, my dear ladies,

104
00:10:34,865 --> 00:10:38,494
you have my permission
to kiss the royal hands.

105
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:40,833
Whichever you like, first.

106
00:10:40,905 --> 00:10:43,169
Mmm! Oh!

107
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,834
How gracious!

108
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,845
- And generous.
- Sire! Sire!

109
00:10:48,913 --> 00:10:51,108
- Did you see what they--
- Stop!

110
00:10:51,182 --> 00:10:53,343
Stop hissing in my ear.

111
00:10:57,488 --> 00:11:00,616
- Ah!

112
00:11:00,691 --> 00:11:03,387
Hiss! Oh, you've
hissed your last--

113
00:11:03,461 --> 00:11:05,395
- hiss.

114
00:11:10,534 --> 00:11:12,627
Suspicious snake.

115
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:16,036
Masterfully done,
Your Excellency.

116
00:11:16,107 --> 00:11:19,907
Now close your eyes... and concentrate.

117
00:11:19,977 --> 00:11:23,310
Close your eyes. Tight shut.
No peeking, sire.

118
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:28,944
From the mists of time,

119
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:31,453
come forth, spirits.

120
00:11:31,522 --> 00:11:33,456
Yoo-hoo!

121
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:37,483
Okay, little fireflies.
Glow, babies, glow.

122
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:39,927
We're waiting.

123
00:11:39,997 --> 00:11:44,730
Ah, oh!
Look, sire. Look!

124
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:50,172
Oh! Incredible.
Floating spirits.

125
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:52,232
Ah, oh!

126
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:55,437
Naughty, naughty.
You mustn't touch, young man.

127
00:11:55,513 --> 00:11:57,606
Oh, how dare you
strike the royal hand.

128
00:11:57,681 --> 00:12:01,447
Shh! You'll break the spell.
Just gaze into the crystal ball.

129
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,783
Oo-de-lally!

130
00:12:03,854 --> 00:12:06,789
Oo-de-lal-- Oh!

131
00:12:06,857 --> 00:12:09,792
A face appears.

132
00:12:11,729 --> 00:12:15,631
- A crown is on his noble brow.
- Oo-de-lally!

133
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:18,133
A crown!
How exciting!

134
00:12:18,202 --> 00:12:20,796
His face is handsome,

135
00:12:20,871 --> 00:12:24,830
regal, majestic,

136
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:27,241
loveable,

137
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:29,472
a cuddly face.

138
00:12:29,547 --> 00:12:33,313
Handsome, regal, oh!
Majestic.

139
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:35,318
Loveable. Yes, yes.

140
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:37,820
Cuddly.

141
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:40,152
Oh, that's me
to a ''T.''

142
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:43,057
It really is. Yes.

143
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:45,652
- I--
- Now what ?

144
00:12:45,729 --> 00:12:48,857
I, uh--

145
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:52,835
I see, um,
your illustrious name.

146
00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:55,394
I know my name!
Get on with it!

147
00:12:55,473 --> 00:13:00,240
Your name will go
down, down, down,

148
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:02,245
in history,
of course.

149
00:13:02,313 --> 00:13:04,645
Yes ! I knew it!
I knew it!

150
00:13:04,715 --> 00:13:07,240
Do you hear that, Hiss ?
Oh, you--

151
00:13:07,318 --> 00:13:09,411
He's in the basket.

152
00:13:09,487 --> 00:13:11,921
Don--
Don't forget it.

153
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,350
Hmm.
What have we here ?

154
00:13:16,427 --> 00:13:20,090
Solid-gold hubcaps.

155
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:33,336
Oo-de-lally.
The jackpot.

156
00:14:09,947 --> 00:14:14,077
- Robbed ! I've been robbed !

157
00:14:14,151 --> 00:14:17,416
Hiss! You're never around
when I need you!

158
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:22,322
- Ahem. I've been robbed.
- Of course you've been robbed!

159
00:14:22,393 --> 00:14:24,486
Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally!

160
00:14:24,562 --> 00:14:27,122
Fortunes forecast.
Lucky charms.

161
00:14:27,197 --> 00:14:29,722
After them, you fools!

162
00:14:43,147 --> 00:14:46,913
No, no, no, no !

163
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:50,579
I knew it. I knew it.
I just knew this would happen.

164
00:14:50,654 --> 00:14:53,418
I tried to warn you, but, no.
You wouldn't listen. You just had to--

165
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:56,323
Ah, ah, ah!
Seven years' bad--

166
00:14:56,393 --> 00:14:59,794
Ooh! Luck.
That's what it is.

167
00:14:59,863 --> 00:15:03,424
Besides, you broke
your mother's mirror.

168
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,934
Mommy !

169
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:10,106
I've got a dirty thumb.

170
00:15:15,011 --> 00:15:18,105
Well, even though Prince John...

171
00:15:18,181 --> 00:15:21,617
offered a huge reward
for the capture of Robin Hood,

172
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:25,849
that elusive rogue kept right on
robbin' the rich to feed the poor.

173
00:15:25,922 --> 00:15:28,447
And believe me,
it's a good thing he did,

174
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:33,087
'cause what with taxes and all,
the poor folks of Nottingham
were starvin' to death.

175
00:15:34,431 --> 00:15:38,060
Uh-oh. Here comes
old bad news himself,

176
00:15:38,134 --> 00:15:41,035
the Honorable
Sheriff of Nottingham.

177
00:15:41,104 --> 00:15:43,664
Every town

178
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,368
Has its taxes too

179
00:15:46,443 --> 00:15:49,037
And the taxes is due

180
00:15:49,112 --> 00:15:51,376
Do do-do do do

181
00:15:51,448 --> 00:15:53,382
Well, lookie there.

182
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,886
Friar Tuck, the old do-gooder.

183
00:15:56,953 --> 00:15:58,887
He's out
doin' good again.

184
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,554
- Well, good mornin', Friar Tuck.
- Shh, Otto.

185
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:10,030
Shh! For you, Otto, from Robin Hood.

186
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,035
Oh, God bless Robin Hood.

187
00:16:13,103 --> 00:16:17,437
Do do do do-do
do dee do do-do

188
00:16:20,543 --> 00:16:23,444
It's the sheriff!
Hurry, hide it! Quick!

189
00:16:23,513 --> 00:16:26,277
Here I come.
Ready or not.

190
00:16:27,884 --> 00:16:32,617
Well, greetings from your friendly
neighborhood tax collector.

191
00:16:32,689 --> 00:16:35,249
Oh, take it easy
on me, Sheriff,

192
00:16:35,325 --> 00:16:37,885
w-what with this busted leg
and all, you know.

193
00:16:37,961 --> 00:16:40,452
I-I'm way behind
in me work, Sheriff.

194
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:45,229
I know, Otto, but you're
way behind with your taxes too.

195
00:16:45,301 --> 00:16:47,895
Oh, have a heart, Sheriff.

196
00:16:47,971 --> 00:16:51,737
Can't you see he's laid up ?
Come on, Otto.

197
00:16:51,808 --> 00:16:53,742
You'd better
sit down and rest.

198
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:56,370
- Oh, thank you. Yes.

199
00:17:00,116 --> 00:17:02,949
Let me give you
a hand with that leg.

200
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:04,953
Upsa-daisy.

201
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:07,421
Upsa-daisy. Bingo!

202
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,756
Ah, what they won't
think of next.

203
00:17:14,697 --> 00:17:16,631
It smarts,
don't it, Otto?

204
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:19,634
But Prince John says
that taxes should hurt.

205
00:17:19,702 --> 00:17:24,162
Now see here, you--
you evil, flint-hearted leech!

206
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,698
Now, now, now, now!
Save your sermon, preacher.

207
00:17:27,777 --> 00:17:30,075
It ain't Sunday, you know.

208
00:17:30,146 --> 00:17:32,614
Do do do-do do

209
00:17:32,682 --> 00:17:37,745
They call me a slob, but I do my job
Do do do-do do

210
00:17:37,821 --> 00:17:41,882
Happy birthday to you

211
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:46,190
Happy birthday to you

212
00:17:46,262 --> 00:17:50,824
Happy birthday, dear Skippy

213
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,267
Happy birthday

214
00:17:54,337 --> 00:17:57,829
To you

215
00:17:57,907 --> 00:18:01,843
Well, now, sonny, that box is
done up right pretty, ain't it?

216
00:18:01,911 --> 00:18:06,848
Well, Mr. Sheriff, sir,
it's my birthday present, sir.

217
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,851
It sure is.
Why don't you open it?

218
00:18:11,955 --> 00:18:14,856
Oh, boy!
One whole farthing!

219
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:22,058
Have you no heart? We all scrimped
and saved to give it to him.

220
00:18:22,132 --> 00:18:26,262
Now that's mighty ''thoughty''
of you, ''widder'' woman.

221
00:18:26,336 --> 00:18:31,069
The family that saves together
pays together.

222
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:33,871
Oh, now, don't take it
so hard, sonny.

223
00:18:33,943 --> 00:18:37,071
Prince John wishes you
a happy birthday too.

224
00:18:37,147 --> 00:18:42,141
Alms, alms,
alms for the poor.

225
00:18:42,218 --> 00:18:44,982
Hmm. Well.

226
00:18:49,459 --> 00:18:54,590
Well, so far it's been
a cheerful morning. Keep savin'!

227
00:18:54,664 --> 00:18:56,598
What a dirty trick.

228
00:18:56,666 --> 00:19:00,067
You poor old man.

229
00:19:00,136 --> 00:19:03,765
Do come in.
Come in and rest yourself.

230
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,071
Thank ye kindly, Mother.
Thank ye.

231
00:19:07,143 --> 00:19:11,773
Tell me now. Did me old ears
hear someone singin' a birthday ditty?

232
00:19:11,848 --> 00:19:14,373
Yes, sir.

233
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:19,114
And that mean old sheriff
took my birthday present.

234
00:19:19,189 --> 00:19:21,419
Did he now?

235
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:25,427
But be a stouthearted little lad,
and don't let it get ya down.

236
00:19:25,495 --> 00:19:28,589
Gee whiz!
It's Robin Hood!

237
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:30,963
Happy birthday, son!

238
00:19:31,034 --> 00:19:36,131
Oh, he's so handsome,
Just like his reward posters.

239
00:19:36,206 --> 00:19:39,801
Tell me, young man,
how old are you today?

240
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:42,470
Gosh, I'm seven years old,
goin' on eight.

241
00:19:42,545 --> 00:19:46,879
Seven? Well, that does
make you the man of the house,

242
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,475
and I've got
Just the right present for you.

243
00:19:49,552 --> 00:19:52,020
For me?

244
00:19:52,088 --> 00:19:55,888
Gee, thanks,
Mr. Robin Hood, sir.

245
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:57,893
Hey, how do I look?
Huh?

246
00:19:57,961 --> 00:20:00,828
Not much like Mr. Robin Hood.

247
00:20:00,897 --> 00:20:03,365
She's right.
There is something missing.

248
00:20:03,433 --> 00:20:06,061
Of course !

249
00:20:06,135 --> 00:20:08,126
There you go.

250
00:20:08,204 --> 00:20:10,900
Boy, oh, boy.
Now how do I look?

251
00:20:10,974 --> 00:20:14,239
The hat's too big.

252
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,642
Shh!
Mind your manners.

253
00:20:16,713 --> 00:20:18,908
Yes, mind your ''mattles.''

254
00:20:18,982 --> 00:20:23,214
Don't worry.
You'll grow into it, young man.

255
00:20:23,286 --> 00:20:26,016
Oo-de-lally!
I'm gonna try it out.

256
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:28,557
Good-bye, Mr. Robin Hood!

257
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,616
Come again
on my birthday!

258
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:36,131
Oh, you have made his birthday
a wonderful one.

259
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:38,360
How can I ever thank you?

260
00:20:38,434 --> 00:20:40,459
I only wish
I could do more.

261
00:20:40,536 --> 00:20:44,131
Here.
And keep your chin up.

262
00:20:44,207 --> 00:20:48,143
Someday there'll be happiness
again in Nottingham. You'll see.

263
00:20:48,211 --> 00:20:50,270
Oh, Robin Hood.

264
00:20:50,346 --> 00:20:53,474
You've risked so much
to keep our hopes alive.

265
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:56,643
Bless you. Bless you.

266
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:11,965
Gee, did Robin Hood
really give it to you?

267
00:21:12,034 --> 00:21:14,366
Yeah, and this is
his own hat too.

268
00:21:14,437 --> 00:21:16,905
Gee, I'd sure like to
shoot your bow and arrow.

269
00:21:16,973 --> 00:21:19,168
- Let me try it, Skippy.
- Oh, no,you don't?

270
00:21:19,242 --> 00:21:21,176
I'm gonna shoot it first.

271
00:21:21,244 --> 00:21:23,178
You're pointin' it too high.

272
00:21:23,246 --> 00:21:25,840
I'm not either.
Watch this.

273
00:21:31,154 --> 00:21:34,146
Uh-oh.
Now you done it.

274
00:21:34,223 --> 00:21:36,987
Right in
Prince John's backyard.

275
00:21:45,568 --> 00:21:47,900
Skippy, you can't
go in there.

276
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,770
Yeah. Prince John
will chop off your head.

277
00:21:51,841 --> 00:21:53,832
Like this.

278
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:56,003
Oh, I don't care.
I gotta get my arrow.

279
00:21:56,078 --> 00:21:58,638
Wait a minute.
Toby might tattle on you.

280
00:21:58,714 --> 00:22:02,741
- Yeah, Toby.
You gotta take the oath.
- An oath?

281
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:05,845
Put your hand on your heart
and cross your eyes.

282
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,054
Spiders, snakes
and a lizard head.

283
00:22:10,126 --> 00:22:13,095
Spiders, snakes
and a lizard's head.

284
00:22:13,162 --> 00:22:15,687
If I tattletale,
I'll die till I'm dead.

285
00:22:15,765 --> 00:22:19,997
If I tattletale,
I'll die till I'm dead.

286
00:22:32,381 --> 00:22:35,873
- It's your turn to serve, Marian dear.
- Are you ready, Lady Kluck?

287
00:22:35,952 --> 00:22:38,614
Oh, as your lady-in-waiting,
I'm waiting.

288
00:22:50,733 --> 00:22:53,793
- I'm getting too old for this.
- Klucky, that was a good shot.

289
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:57,237
You're not bad yourself, dear.
Oh, my girdle's killing me.

290
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,614
Where is it?
Did you lose it?

291
00:23:06,682 --> 00:23:09,913
- It must be in there someplace.
- Oh, Klucky, you look so silly.

292
00:23:09,986 --> 00:23:14,116
- Oh, look. There it is behind you.

293
00:23:15,391 --> 00:23:17,951
Oh!
Well, hello.

294
00:23:18,027 --> 00:23:22,589
- Where did you come from?
- Oh, please don't tell Prince John.

295
00:23:22,665 --> 00:23:25,190
Mama said he'll
chop off my head.

296
00:23:25,268 --> 00:23:27,964
Oh, don't be afraid.
You've done nothing wrong.

297
00:23:28,037 --> 00:23:31,097
Oh, Marian,
what a bonny wee bunny.

298
00:23:31,173 --> 00:23:33,664
Who does this young archer
remind you of?

299
00:23:35,611 --> 00:23:40,514
Well, upon my word,
the notorious Robin Hood.

300
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:43,518
That's right. Only Robin Hood
wears a hat like that.

301
00:23:43,586 --> 00:23:46,680
Yeah, and look at this keen
Robin Hood bow.

302
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,261
Oh, Marian,
don't look around,

303
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,264
but I do believe
we're surrounded.

304
00:23:56,332 --> 00:24:00,860
- Oh, mercy!
- He snitched on us.

305
00:24:00,937 --> 00:24:04,964
It's all right, children.
Don't be afraid. Please come here.

306
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:08,909
- Do you think it's safe?
- That's Maid Marian.

307
00:24:08,978 --> 00:24:11,538
Mama said she's awful nice.
Come on!

308
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:17,883
Hey, you guys, not so fast.
Wait for me.

309
00:24:17,954 --> 00:24:20,821
I told Skippy
he was shooting too high.

310
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:25,657
I'm so very glad he did.
Now I get to meet all of you.

311
00:24:25,728 --> 00:24:30,324
- Gee, you're very beautiful.
- Are you gonna marry Robin Hood?

312
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:34,665
Mama said you and Robin Hood
are sweethearts.

313
00:24:35,905 --> 00:24:38,066
Well, um--

314
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,166
You see, that was several years ago
before I left for London.

315
00:24:41,243 --> 00:24:46,408
- Did he ever kiss you?
- Well, uh, no.

316
00:24:46,482 --> 00:24:49,246
But he carved our initials
on this tree.

317
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:54,955
- I remember it so well.
- You gonna have any kids?

318
00:24:55,024 --> 00:24:57,754
My mom gots
a lot of kids.

319
00:24:57,827 --> 00:25:00,125
Oh, he's probably
forgotten all about me.

320
00:25:00,196 --> 00:25:02,687
Oh, not Robin Hood.

321
00:25:02,765 --> 00:25:06,132
I bet he'll storm the castle gates,
fight the guards,

322
00:25:06,202 --> 00:25:08,966
rescue ya and drag you
off to Sherwood Forest.

323
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:13,566
Now just a moment there,
young man.

324
00:25:13,642 --> 00:25:16,133
You've forgotten Prince John.

325
00:25:16,212 --> 00:25:18,646
That old Prince John
don't scare me none.

326
00:25:18,714 --> 00:25:22,980
I'm scared of Prince John.
He's cranky.

327
00:25:23,052 --> 00:25:25,020
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

328
00:25:25,087 --> 00:25:29,990
I, Prince John, challenge you
to a duel. Hey, hey!

329
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:33,324
Take that! And that!
And this!

330
00:25:35,231 --> 00:25:37,665
Death to tyrants!

331
00:25:37,733 --> 00:25:40,224
Och! Och, och!

332
00:25:40,302 --> 00:25:42,236
Slice him to pieces!

333
00:25:44,306 --> 00:25:46,570
Oh, save me, my hero.
Save me.

334
00:25:46,642 --> 00:25:50,134
- Oh! Ouch! That's not fair.

335
00:25:50,212 --> 00:25:53,477
Mommy!

336
00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:57,952
That's Prince John, all right.

337
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,284
Yahoo!
Now I got ya!

338
00:26:00,356 --> 00:26:03,757
Och, mercy! Mercy!
Oh!

339
00:26:04,894 --> 00:26:08,990
Oh, he got me.
I'm dying.

340
00:26:09,065 --> 00:26:11,761
- Oh!
- Did I hurt you? Huh?

341
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:16,669
No, this is the part where you drag
your lady fair off to Sherwood Forest.

342
00:26:18,908 --> 00:26:21,342
Come on, lady fair!
Let's go!

343
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:26,006
Oh, Robin, you're so brave
and impetuous.

344
00:26:27,216 --> 00:26:30,845
Oh.
So this is Sherwood Forest.

345
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,480
Yeah, I guess so.

346
00:26:33,556 --> 00:26:36,024
Well, now what are we
gonna do?

347
00:26:36,092 --> 00:26:40,222
Well, usually the hero
gives his fair lady a kiss.

348
00:26:40,296 --> 00:26:43,732
A kiss?
Oh, that's sissy stuff.

349
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:47,235
Well, if you won't,
then I will.

350
00:26:49,305 --> 00:26:52,570
- They're kissing!

351
00:27:22,337 --> 00:27:26,273
Ah, me. Young love.

352
00:27:26,341 --> 00:27:28,605
Oh, it's a grand thing.

353
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:34,275
Oh, Klucky, surely he must know
how much I still love him.

354
00:27:34,349 --> 00:27:37,614
But, of course, my dear.
Believe me,

355
00:27:37,686 --> 00:27:41,645
someday soon,
your uncle, King Richard,

356
00:27:41,724 --> 00:27:44,124
will have an outlaw
for an in-law.

357
00:27:46,195 --> 00:27:50,461
Oh, Klucky.
But when? When?

358
00:27:50,532 --> 00:27:52,966
Oh, patience, my dear.
Patience.

359
00:27:53,035 --> 00:27:56,300
Remember, absence
makes the heart grow fonder.

360
00:27:57,372 --> 00:28:00,466
Or forgetful.

361
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:02,476
Oh, I've been away
so long.

362
00:28:03,545 --> 00:28:06,070
What if he's
forgotten all about me?

363
00:28:18,594 --> 00:28:22,655
Hey, lover boy. How's that grub
comin'? Man, I'm starved.

364
00:28:25,267 --> 00:28:29,931
Rob? Robin?

365
00:28:30,005 --> 00:28:31,996
Robert?

366
00:28:32,074 --> 00:28:35,771
- Hey!
- Hmm? What? What do you say?

367
00:28:35,844 --> 00:28:38,813
Aw, forget it.
Your mind's not on food.

368
00:28:38,881 --> 00:28:42,339
You're thinkin' about somebody
with long eyelashes,

369
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:45,250
and you're smellin'
that sweet perfume.

370
00:28:48,223 --> 00:28:50,521
Hey, whoa!
It's boiling over!

371
00:28:50,592 --> 00:28:52,526
You're burnin' the chow!

372
00:28:54,496 --> 00:28:58,796
Sorry, Johnny. Guess I was thinking
about Maid Marian again.

373
00:28:58,867 --> 00:29:01,335
I can't help it.

374
00:29:01,403 --> 00:29:03,268
I love her,Johnny.

375
00:29:03,338 --> 00:29:06,569
Look, why don't you stop
moonin' and mopin' around?

376
00:29:06,642 --> 00:29:10,476
-Just-- Just marry the girl.
- Marry her?

377
00:29:10,546 --> 00:29:13,777
You don't just walk up to a girl,
hand her a bouquet and say,

378
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:16,613
'' Hey, remember me? We were
kids together. Will you marry me?''

379
00:29:16,685 --> 00:29:19,677
No. It just isn't done that way.

380
00:29:19,755 --> 00:29:23,555
Aw, come on, Robbie.
Climb the castle walls.

381
00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:28,624
Sweep her off her feet.
Carry her off in style.

382
00:29:28,697 --> 00:29:31,962
It's no use,Johnny.
I've thought it all out, and...

383
00:29:32,034 --> 00:29:33,968
it just wouldn't work.

384
00:29:34,036 --> 00:29:36,129
Besides, what have I got
to offer her?

385
00:29:36,205 --> 00:29:38,469
Well, for one thing,
you can't cook.

386
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:42,135
I'm serious, Johnny. She's
a highborn lady of quality.

387
00:29:42,211 --> 00:29:44,907
So she's got class?
So what?

388
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,813
I'm an outlaw,
that's what.

389
00:29:47,883 --> 00:29:50,818
That's no life for a lovely lady.
Always on the run.

390
00:29:50,886 --> 00:29:55,653
- What kind of a future is that?
- Oh, for heaven's sake, son.

391
00:29:55,724 --> 00:29:58,158
You're no outlaw.

392
00:29:58,227 --> 00:30:01,492
Why, someday you'll be called
a great hero.

393
00:30:01,563 --> 00:30:05,829
A hero? Do you hear that, Johnny?
We've just been pardoned.

394
00:30:05,901 --> 00:30:09,837
That's a gas.
We ain't even been arrested yet.

395
00:30:09,905 --> 00:30:12,169
All right.
Laugh, you two rogues.

396
00:30:12,241 --> 00:30:16,234
But there's gonna be
a big to-do in Nottingham.

397
00:30:19,081 --> 00:30:21,015
Well done, ain't it?

398
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:26,020
Old Prince John's havin' a championship
archery tournament tomorrow.

399
00:30:26,088 --> 00:30:28,283
Archery tournament?
Ha!

400
00:30:28,357 --> 00:30:31,190
Old Rob could win that
standin' on his head, huh, Rob?

401
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:36,095
Thank you, Little John.
But I'm sure we're not invited.

402
00:30:36,164 --> 00:30:39,133
No, but there's somebody...

403
00:30:39,201 --> 00:30:42,193
who'll be very disappointed
if you don't come.

404
00:30:42,271 --> 00:30:45,104
Yeah, old bushel britches,

405
00:30:45,173 --> 00:30:47,437
the Honorable
Sheriff of Nottingham.

406
00:30:47,509 --> 00:30:51,969
- No, Maid Marian.
- Maid Marian?

407
00:30:52,047 --> 00:30:56,108
Yeah. She-- She's gonna give
a kiss to the winner.

408
00:30:56,184 --> 00:30:59,449
- Kiss to the winner!

409
00:30:59,521 --> 00:31:03,423
Oo-de-lally! Come on,Johnny!
What are we waiting for?

410
00:31:03,492 --> 00:31:08,429
Wait a minute, Rob. Hold it. That
place will be crawlin' with soldiers.

411
00:31:09,531 --> 00:31:12,056
Aha! But, remember.

412
00:31:12,134 --> 00:31:15,433
Faint hearts
never won fair lady.

413
00:31:15,504 --> 00:31:19,099
Fear not, my friends.

414
00:31:19,174 --> 00:31:22,575
This will be
my greatest performance.

415
00:31:53,675 --> 00:31:57,133
Hiss, this is a red-letter day.

416
00:31:57,212 --> 00:32:01,308
A coup d'etat,
to coin a Norman phrase.

417
00:32:01,383 --> 00:32:04,113
Oh, yes, indeed, sire.

418
00:32:04,186 --> 00:32:08,486
Your plan to capture Robin Hood
in public is sheer genius.

419
00:32:08,557 --> 00:32:13,187
- Hiss, no one sits higher
than the king.

420
00:32:13,261 --> 00:32:17,561
Must I remind you, Hiss?

421
00:32:17,632 --> 00:32:20,897
Oh, oh, forgive me, sire.
I-I didn't mean to--

422
00:32:20,969 --> 00:32:23,870
My trap is baited and set...

423
00:32:23,939 --> 00:32:26,772
and then revenge!

424
00:32:26,842 --> 00:32:28,901
Ah, revenge!

425
00:32:28,977 --> 00:32:31,639
Shh! Not so loud, sire.

426
00:32:31,713 --> 00:32:36,446
Remember, only you and I know,
and your secret is my secret.

427
00:32:36,518 --> 00:32:39,851
Stop!
Stop hissing in my ear.

428
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:44,881
- Secret? What secret?
- Why, the capture of Robin Hood, sire.

429
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,724
That insolent blackguard.

430
00:32:47,796 --> 00:32:51,823
Ooh! I'll show him
who wears the crown!

431
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,460
I share your loathing,
sire.

432
00:32:54,536 --> 00:32:58,165
That scurrilous scoundrel who
fooled you with that silly disguise,

433
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,403
who dared to rob you and made you look
so utterly ridiculous--

434
00:33:01,476 --> 00:33:04,206
Enough!

435
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:07,373
Hiss, you deliberately dodged.

436
00:33:07,449 --> 00:33:10,941
But-- B-But--
Sire, please.

437
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:14,455
Stop snivelling
and hold still.

438
00:33:18,193 --> 00:33:20,127
Thank you, sire.

439
00:33:20,195 --> 00:33:22,789
Oh, Klucky,
I'm so excited.

440
00:33:22,864 --> 00:33:24,957
But how will I
recognize him?

441
00:33:25,033 --> 00:33:27,763
Och, he'll
let you know somehow.

442
00:33:27,836 --> 00:33:31,237
That young rogue of yours
is full of surprises, my dear.

443
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:37,375
There she is, Little John.
Isn't she beautiful?

444
00:33:37,446 --> 00:33:41,576
Cool it, lover boy. Your heart's
runnin' away with your head.

445
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:45,313
Oh, stop worrying.
This disguise would fool my own mother.

446
00:33:45,387 --> 00:33:47,855
Yeah, but your mom ain't here.

447
00:33:47,923 --> 00:33:51,324
You gotta fool
old bushel britches.

448
00:33:56,064 --> 00:33:57,998
- Sheriff? Your Honor?
- Yeah.

449
00:33:58,066 --> 00:34:02,833
Meetin' ya face-to-face is a real treat.
A real treat.

450
00:34:02,904 --> 00:34:05,407
Well, now, thank you.

451
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,236
Oh, excuse me. I gotta go
win this tournament.

452
00:34:09,511 --> 00:34:11,741
Hey, old Rob's
not a bad actor.

453
00:34:11,813 --> 00:34:15,772
But wait till he sees this scene
I lay on Prince John.

454
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,683
Ah! Me lord.

455
00:34:21,756 --> 00:34:25,749
My esteemed royal sovereign
of the realm.

456
00:34:25,827 --> 00:34:28,352
The head man himself.

457
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:31,228
You're beautiful.

458
00:34:31,299 --> 00:34:34,826
He has style, eh, Hiss?

459
00:34:39,441 --> 00:34:42,706
You took the words
right out of my mouth, P.J.

460
00:34:42,777 --> 00:34:46,304
'' P.J.'' ! I like that.
Do you know I do?

461
00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:48,611
Hiss, put it
on my luggage.

462
00:34:48,683 --> 00:34:51,618
PJ.

463
00:34:51,686 --> 00:34:53,950
P.J. Yes.

464
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:56,616
Hmpf!
And you?

465
00:34:56,691 --> 00:34:59,524
Who might you be, sir?

466
00:34:59,594 --> 00:35:03,496
I am Sir Reginald,
duke of Chutney.

467
00:35:03,565 --> 00:35:06,466
And don't stick your tongue
out at me, kid.

468
00:35:08,002 --> 00:35:12,029
And now, Your Mightiness,
allow me to lay some protocol on you.

469
00:35:12,106 --> 00:35:16,475
Oh, no. Uh, forgive me,
but I lose more jewels that way than--

470
00:35:16,544 --> 00:35:18,637
Please sit down.

471
00:35:18,713 --> 00:35:22,080
Thanks, P.J. Couldn't get
a better seat than this, could you?

472
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:24,812
The royal box.
Oh! Hey!

473
00:35:24,886 --> 00:35:28,822
Hey, wait a minute!
What's-- Oh, excuse me, buster.

474
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:33,156
'' Buster'' ? You, sir,
have taken my seat.

475
00:35:36,231 --> 00:35:39,496
Hiss, with you around,
who needs a court jester?

476
00:35:44,873 --> 00:35:50,175
Now get out there and keep your
snake eyes open for you know who.

477
00:35:50,245 --> 00:35:54,841
You-- You mean, I--
I'm being dismissed ?

478
00:35:54,916 --> 00:35:57,510
You heard His Mightiness.
Move it, creepy.

479
00:35:57,585 --> 00:36:00,611
Get lost.
Begone, long one.

480
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:04,854
What cheek ! ''Creepy''?

481
00:36:04,926 --> 00:36:08,089
'' Buster''? ''Long one''?

482
00:36:08,162 --> 00:36:10,926
Who does that dopey duke
think he is?

483
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:15,129
- Now he's up to somethin', Friar.
- Yeah! Come on!

484
00:37:12,527 --> 00:37:14,995
Ah, Your Ladyship.

485
00:37:15,063 --> 00:37:17,293
Beggin' your pardon,
but it's a great honor...

486
00:37:17,365 --> 00:37:21,199
to be shootin' for the favor
of a lovely lady like yourself.

487
00:37:21,269 --> 00:37:23,863
I hopes I win the kiss.

488
00:37:23,938 --> 00:37:26,873
Oh!

489
00:37:28,276 --> 00:37:32,804
Well, thank you, my thin-legged archer.

490
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,905
I wish you luck,

491
00:37:34,983 --> 00:37:37,144
with all my heart.

492
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,888
I wonder.

493
00:37:44,058 --> 00:37:47,323
Your Highness,
with your royal permission,

494
00:37:47,395 --> 00:37:49,329
we are ready to begin.

495
00:37:49,397 --> 00:37:51,991
Proceed, Captain!

496
00:37:52,066 --> 00:37:56,526
The tournament of the golden arrow
will now begin.

497
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,059
Yea, Dad!

498
00:38:40,815 --> 00:38:44,080
A perfect bull's-eye.

499
00:38:44,152 --> 00:38:46,677
- Well, well.
- Yeah.

500
00:38:46,754 --> 00:38:50,087
That's what you call pullin' it back
and lettin' it go, P.J.

501
00:38:50,158 --> 00:38:52,149
I'm gonna win
that golden arrow,

502
00:38:52,226 --> 00:38:54,990
and then I'm gonna present meself
to the lovely Maid Marian and--

503
00:38:55,063 --> 00:38:57,930
Listen, scissorbill,
if you shoot...

504
00:38:57,999 --> 00:39:01,230
half as good as you blabbermouth,
you're better'n Robin Hood.

505
00:39:01,302 --> 00:39:04,465
Robin Hood, he says!
Wowee!

506
00:39:04,539 --> 00:39:07,474
I'm tiptop, all right,
but I'm not as good as he is.

507
00:39:15,183 --> 00:39:19,643
That kid's got class, ain't he, P.J.?

508
00:39:19,721 --> 00:39:22,918
Indeed he has, Reggie.

509
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:27,256
Bravo! Uh, bravo! Yes.

510
00:39:27,328 --> 00:39:30,092
Oh, um, by the way.

511
00:39:30,164 --> 00:39:35,261
I hear you're havin' a bit of trouble
gettin' your hands on that Robin Hood.

512
00:39:35,336 --> 00:39:37,497
He's scared of me,
that's what he is.

513
00:39:37,572 --> 00:39:39,972
You notice he didn't
show up here today.

514
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:44,068
Huh! I could spot him
through them phony disguises.

515
00:39:44,145 --> 00:39:46,545
It's him!
It's Robin Hood!

516
00:39:46,614 --> 00:39:50,243
I just can't wait
till I tell His Majesty.

517
00:40:01,429 --> 00:40:03,556
Unhand me, you--

518
00:40:03,631 --> 00:40:06,122
Please, please!
I don't drink!

519
00:40:09,337 --> 00:40:11,430
Attention, everyone.

520
00:40:11,506 --> 00:40:14,304
The final contestants are...

521
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:17,469
the Honorable
Sheriff of Nottingham...

522
00:40:21,883 --> 00:40:26,616
and the spindle-legged stork
from Devonshire.

523
00:40:30,725 --> 00:40:35,492
My dear, I suspect you favor
the gangly youth, hmm?

524
00:40:35,563 --> 00:40:39,090
Uh, why, yes, sire.

525
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:41,499
Well, at least he amuses me.

526
00:40:41,569 --> 00:40:45,061
Coincidently, my dear young lady,

527
00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:49,337
he amuses me too.

528
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:52,277
For the final shoot-out,

529
00:40:52,346 --> 00:40:55,975
move the target back
30 paces.

530
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:58,018
You heard him, Nutsy!
Get goin'!

531
00:40:58,085 --> 00:41:00,178
Move it, you birdbrain.

532
00:41:01,756 --> 00:41:04,316
And remember
what you're supposed to do.

533
00:41:04,392 --> 00:41:06,326
Yes, sir, Sheriff, sir.

534
00:41:13,835 --> 00:41:18,431
Well, that shot wins
the golden arrow,

535
00:41:18,506 --> 00:41:20,940
the kiss
and the whole caboodle.

536
00:41:34,589 --> 00:41:38,184
- Yea! He did it,
he did it, he did it!

537
00:42:03,617 --> 00:42:06,381
Archer, I commend you,
and because of...

538
00:42:06,454 --> 00:42:11,050
your superior skill, you shall
get what is coming to you.

539
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:15,994
Our royal congratulations.

540
00:42:16,063 --> 00:42:17,997
Oh, thank you kindly,
Your Highness.

541
00:42:18,065 --> 00:42:23,697
Meetin' you face-to-face,
Your High and Mighty, is a real treat.

542
00:42:23,771 --> 00:42:27,138
Release the royal fingers.
Ah!

543
00:42:28,676 --> 00:42:30,610
And now I name you...

544
00:42:30,678 --> 00:42:32,646
the winner,

545
00:42:32,713 --> 00:42:36,342
or, more appropriately,

546
00:42:36,417 --> 00:42:38,749
the loser!

547
00:42:40,821 --> 00:42:43,085
Seize him.

548
00:42:47,828 --> 00:42:51,423
I sentence you to sudden,
instant and even...

549
00:42:51,499 --> 00:42:53,933
immediate death!

550
00:42:54,001 --> 00:42:57,937
Oh, no! Oh!

551
00:42:58,005 --> 00:42:59,939
Please.

552
00:43:00,007 --> 00:43:03,602
Please, sire.
I beg of you to spare his life.

553
00:43:03,677 --> 00:43:06,271
Please have mercy.

554
00:43:06,347 --> 00:43:09,510
My dear emotional lady,
why should I?

555
00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:11,949
Because I love him,
Your Highness.

556
00:43:12,019 --> 00:43:13,953
'' Love him''?

557
00:43:14,021 --> 00:43:17,957
And does this prisoner
return your love?

558
00:43:20,361 --> 00:43:24,957
Marian, my darling, I love you
more than life itself.

559
00:43:25,032 --> 00:43:28,468
Ah, young love.

560
00:43:28,536 --> 00:43:33,838
Your pleas have not fallen
upon a heart of stone.

561
00:43:33,908 --> 00:43:37,503
But traitors to the Crown
must die!

562
00:43:37,578 --> 00:43:40,069
Traitor to the Crown?
That crown belongs to King Richard.

563
00:43:40,147 --> 00:43:44,208
- Long live King Richard!
- Long live King Richard!

564
00:43:44,285 --> 00:43:48,847
Enough! I am king!
King! King!

565
00:43:48,923 --> 00:43:51,551
Ah! Off with his head!

566
00:44:04,104 --> 00:44:06,971
Oh, no!

567
00:44:09,243 --> 00:44:14,078
Stop! Executioner, stop!
Hold your ax!

568
00:44:14,148 --> 00:44:17,481
Okay, big shot. Now tell them
to untie my buddy, or I'll--

569
00:44:17,551 --> 00:44:20,850
Sheriff, release my buddy--

570
00:44:20,921 --> 00:44:24,584
I mean, release the prisoner!

571
00:44:24,658 --> 00:44:26,922
Untie the prisoner?

572
00:44:26,994 --> 00:44:29,588
You heard what he said,
bushel britches.

573
00:44:29,663 --> 00:44:32,393
Sheriff, I make the rules,

574
00:44:32,466 --> 00:44:35,367
and since I am the head man--

575
00:44:35,436 --> 00:44:38,098
Not so hard, you mean thing.

576
00:44:38,172 --> 00:44:42,268
Let him go, for heaven's sakes!
Let him go!

577
00:44:42,343 --> 00:44:46,143
Yee-hee!
Love conquers all!

578
00:44:51,218 --> 00:44:53,652
I owe my life to you,
my darling.

579
00:44:53,721 --> 00:44:57,157
I couldn't have lived
without you, Robin.

580
00:44:57,224 --> 00:44:59,920
There's somethin' funny
goin' on around here.

581
00:44:59,994 --> 00:45:03,088
Now, P.J., tell my pal
to kiss Maid Marian,

582
00:45:03,163 --> 00:45:05,154
or I've just found
a new pincushion.

583
00:45:05,232 --> 00:45:08,258
Why, you!

584
00:45:08,335 --> 00:45:11,930
Kill him!
Don't stand there! Kill him!

585
00:45:26,921 --> 00:45:30,857
Don't hurt me! No, no!
Don't hurt me! Help! Help!

586
00:45:35,696 --> 00:45:37,823
Kill him!

587
00:45:37,898 --> 00:45:41,994
Run for it, lassie!
This is no place for a lady!

588
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,206
Take that,
you scoundrel.

589
00:45:49,276 --> 00:45:51,506
Help! Robin, help!

590
00:45:56,116 --> 00:45:57,947
Marian, my love,
will you marry me?

591
00:45:58,018 --> 00:46:00,953
Oh, darling, I thought
you'd never ask me.

592
00:46:03,023 --> 00:46:06,686
But you could have chosen
a more romantic setting.

593
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,524
- And for our honeymoon, London--
- Yes!

594
00:46:09,597 --> 00:46:12,498
- Normandy! Sunny Spain!
- Yes! Why not?

595
00:46:15,269 --> 00:46:18,204
Ooh, what a main event
this is.

596
00:46:21,942 --> 00:46:23,876
What a beautiful brawl.

597
00:46:32,419 --> 00:46:35,911
Hey! Who's drivin'
this flyin' umbrella?

598
00:46:43,063 --> 00:46:45,827
- We'll have six children.
- Six?

599
00:46:45,899 --> 00:46:47,992
Oh, a dozen at least.

600
00:46:51,005 --> 00:46:52,939
Take that!

601
00:46:57,911 --> 00:46:59,572
Attention, everyone.

602
00:47:33,881 --> 00:47:35,815
Stop the girl!

603
00:47:35,883 --> 00:47:40,149
- Ooh!
- Take that, you scurvy knave!

604
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:42,154
Seize the fat one!

605
00:48:05,979 --> 00:48:08,573
Yahoo!

606
00:48:17,591 --> 00:48:20,754
- Long live King Richard!

607
00:48:20,828 --> 00:48:23,228
Yee-hoo!

608
00:48:25,532 --> 00:48:28,433
Hiss! You're never around
when I need you!

609
00:48:28,502 --> 00:48:31,960
Coming. Coming.

610
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:36,135
For I'm a jolly good fellow
For I'm a jolly good--

611
00:48:38,879 --> 00:48:41,814
Oh! Oh, there
you are, old boy!

612
00:48:41,882 --> 00:48:46,148
PJ.,you won't believe this,
but the stork is really Robin Hood.

613
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,814
Robin Hood.

614
00:48:55,362 --> 00:48:57,796
Get out of that
if you can.

615
00:49:10,211 --> 00:49:15,410
Love It seems like only yesterday

616
00:49:17,318 --> 00:49:21,345
You were just a child
at play

617
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:25,756
Now you're all grown up

618
00:49:25,826 --> 00:49:29,023
Inside of me

619
00:49:29,096 --> 00:49:33,226
Oh, how fast
those moments flee

620
00:49:35,169 --> 00:49:40,106
Once we watched
a lazy world go by

621
00:49:41,175 --> 00:49:45,202
Now the days seem to fly

622
00:49:46,747 --> 00:49:49,807
Life is brief

623
00:49:49,884 --> 00:49:52,853
But when it's gone

624
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,913
Love goes on and on

625
00:50:03,664 --> 00:50:06,758
Love will live

626
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:12,605
Love will last

627
00:50:17,344 --> 00:50:20,211
Love goes on

628
00:50:20,281 --> 00:50:22,909
And on and on

629
00:50:22,983 --> 00:50:27,750
Once we watched
a lazy world go by

630
00:50:29,223 --> 00:50:33,091
Now the days seem to fly

631
00:50:34,461 --> 00:50:37,919
Life is brief

632
00:50:37,998 --> 00:50:40,796
But when it's gone

633
00:50:40,868 --> 00:50:45,896
Love goes on and on

634
00:50:50,244 --> 00:50:53,736
Oh, Robin,
what a beautiful night.

635
00:50:53,814 --> 00:50:56,305
I wish it would never end.

636
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:58,317
Surprise!

637
00:50:58,385 --> 00:51:02,685
- Long live Robin Hood !
- Hooray!

638
00:51:02,756 --> 00:51:06,692
- And long live Maid Marian!
- Bravo!

639
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,194
- Bravo!
- Hear, hear ! Bravo ! Bravo!

640
00:51:09,263 --> 00:51:11,322
Hooray!

641
00:51:11,565 --> 00:51:14,966
And down with
that scurvy PrinceJohn!

642
00:51:15,035 --> 00:51:17,663
Yeah.

643
00:51:17,738 --> 00:51:22,698
Oh, the world will sing of an English
king a thousand years from now

644
00:51:22,776 --> 00:51:26,872
And not because he passed some laws
or had that lofty brow

645
00:51:26,947 --> 00:51:31,577
While bonny good King Richard
leads the great crusade he's on

646
00:51:31,652 --> 00:51:35,850
We'll all have to slave away
for that good-for-nothin' John

647
00:51:35,923 --> 00:51:38,391
Incredible as he is inept

648
00:51:38,459 --> 00:51:40,393
Whenever the history books
are kept

649
00:51:40,461 --> 00:51:44,261
They'll call him
the phony king of England

650
00:51:44,331 --> 00:51:49,030
A pox on
that phony king of England

651
00:52:01,949 --> 00:52:06,477
He sits alone on the giant throne
pretendin' he's the king

652
00:52:06,553 --> 00:52:10,751
A little tyke who's rather like
a puppet on a string

653
00:52:10,824 --> 00:52:14,851
And he throws an angry tantrum
if he cannot have his way

654
00:52:14,928 --> 00:52:19,160
And then he calls for Mom
while he's suckin' his thumb.

655
00:52:19,233 --> 00:52:23,431
You see,
he doesn't wanna play.

656
00:52:23,504 --> 00:52:25,438
Too late to be known
as John the First

657
00:52:25,506 --> 00:52:27,872
He's sure to be known
as John the Worst

658
00:52:27,941 --> 00:52:31,877
Apox on
that phony king of England

659
00:52:31,945 --> 00:52:34,880
Lay that country on me
babe

660
00:52:38,952 --> 00:52:40,886
Come on, Johnny.

661
00:52:42,022 --> 00:52:43,956
Go, laddie, go!

662
00:52:45,025 --> 00:52:47,084
Oh, oh, oooh!

663
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,974
While he taxes us to pieces
and he robs us of our bread

664
00:53:11,051 --> 00:53:14,953
King Richard's crown keeps slippin'
down around that pointed head

665
00:53:15,022 --> 00:53:19,789
Ah, but while there is a merry man
in Robin's wily pack

666
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:23,626
We'll find a way to make him pay
and steal our money back

667
00:53:23,697 --> 00:53:26,632
A minute before
he knows we're there

668
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,965
- Old Rob'll snatch his underwear.

669
00:53:34,141 --> 00:53:38,043
The breezy and
uneasy king of England

670
00:53:38,112 --> 00:53:40,046
The snivelin; grovelin'

671
00:53:40,114 --> 00:53:42,708
Measly, weaselly

672
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,978
Blabberin', jabberin'

673
00:53:45,052 --> 00:53:47,111
Jibberin', jabberin'

674
00:53:47,187 --> 00:53:49,280
Plunderin', plottin'

675
00:53:49,356 --> 00:53:51,483
Wheelin; dealin'

676
00:53:51,558 --> 00:53:55,324
Prince John
That phony king of England

677
00:53:55,396 --> 00:53:57,990
Yeah

678
00:54:04,405 --> 00:54:08,671
He throws an angry tantrum
if he cannot have his way

679
00:54:08,742 --> 00:54:13,008
He calls for Mom and sucks his thumb
and doesn't want to play

680
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,514
Too late to be known
as John the First

681
00:54:15,582 --> 00:54:19,074
He's sure to be known
as John the Worst

682
00:54:19,153 --> 00:54:21,178
How about that?

683
00:54:21,255 --> 00:54:26,557
That's P.J. to a ''T.'' Let me try.
Let me try.

684
00:54:30,431 --> 00:54:33,457
Too late to be known
as John the First

685
00:54:33,534 --> 00:54:37,436
He's sure to be known
as John the Worst

686
00:54:37,504 --> 00:54:41,270
The fabulous, marvelous,
merciful, chivalrous--

687
00:54:41,341 --> 00:54:43,434
Oh, you got it
all wrong, Hiss.

688
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:46,968
- The snivelin', grovelin',
weaselly, measly--
- Enough!

689
00:54:49,216 --> 00:54:51,776
But-But, sire,
it's a big hit.

690
00:54:51,852 --> 00:54:54,377
The whole village
is singin' it.

691
00:54:54,455 --> 00:54:57,515
Oh, they are, are they?

692
00:54:57,591 --> 00:55:01,493
Well, they'll be singing
a different tune.

693
00:55:01,562 --> 00:55:05,521
Double the taxes!
Triple the taxes!

694
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,329
Squeeze every last drop...

695
00:55:08,402 --> 00:55:12,338
out of those insolent,
musical peasants!

696
00:55:17,611 --> 00:55:19,579
Man, oh, man.

697
00:55:19,646 --> 00:55:24,640
- Prince John sure made good his threat,

698
00:55:24,718 --> 00:55:26,777
and his helpless subjects
paid dearly...

699
00:55:26,854 --> 00:55:31,314
for his humiliation,
believe me.

700
00:55:31,391 --> 00:55:34,792
Taxes, taxes, taxes.

701
00:55:34,862 --> 00:55:39,231
Why, he taxed the heart and soul
out of the poor people of Nottingham.

702
00:55:39,299 --> 00:55:42,826
- And if you couldn't pay your taxes,

703
00:55:42,903 --> 00:55:46,134
you went to jail.

704
00:55:46,206 --> 00:55:51,075
Yep, I'm in here too.
Nottingham was in deep trouble.

705
00:55:54,715 --> 00:55:57,183
Every town

706
00:55:58,652 --> 00:56:02,179
Has its ups and downs

707
00:56:04,691 --> 00:56:06,818
Sometimes ups

708
00:56:10,063 --> 00:56:12,588
Outnumber the downs

709
00:56:14,768 --> 00:56:17,635
But not in Nottingham

710
00:56:19,406 --> 00:56:23,001
I'm inclined to believe

711
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:28,375
If we weren't so down

712
00:56:30,684 --> 00:56:33,414
We'd up and leave

713
00:56:35,923 --> 00:56:38,414
We'd up and fly

714
00:56:38,492 --> 00:56:41,428
If we had wings for flyin'

715
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:46,957
Can't you see
the tears we're cryin'

716
00:56:48,101 --> 00:56:51,593
Can't there
be some happiness

717
00:56:51,671 --> 00:56:54,196
For me

718
00:56:56,142 --> 00:56:59,009
Not in Nottingham

719
00:57:47,293 --> 00:57:52,424
Friar Tuck,
I don't think anyone is coming.

720
00:57:52,499 --> 00:57:56,435
You're right, Sexton, but maybe
the sound of this church bell...

721
00:57:56,503 --> 00:57:59,631
will bring those poor people
some comfort.

722
00:58:02,275 --> 00:58:06,439
We must do what we can
to keep their hopes alive.

723
00:58:09,182 --> 00:58:14,245
Oh, how can there be any hope
with that tyrant Prince John...

724
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,585
taxing the heart and soul
out of the poor people?

725
00:58:17,657 --> 00:58:20,524
Yes, those poor people.

726
00:58:20,593 --> 00:58:24,529
Look, our poor box
is like our church--

727
00:58:24,597 --> 00:58:26,531
empty.

728
00:58:34,274 --> 00:58:38,233
Friar Tuck, we've saved this.

729
00:58:38,311 --> 00:58:41,906
It's not much, but please
take it for the poor.

730
00:58:41,981 --> 00:58:45,212
Your last farthing?

731
00:58:45,285 --> 00:58:47,253
Aw, little sister,

732
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:50,380
no one can give more than that.

733
00:58:50,456 --> 00:58:52,754
Bless you both.

734
00:58:52,825 --> 00:58:56,420
Oh, we were just saving it
for a rainy day.

735
00:58:56,496 --> 00:58:59,192
Well, it's rainin' now.

736
00:58:59,265 --> 00:59:03,725
- Things can't get worse.
- Howdy, Friar.

737
00:59:03,803 --> 00:59:07,534
- Well, it looks like
I dropped by just in time.

738
00:59:07,607 --> 00:59:11,907
-What does that big-bellied bully want?
-Father, shh.

739
00:59:13,513 --> 00:59:16,482
Hmm. Well,
what have we got here?

740
00:59:16,549 --> 00:59:19,347
Now, just a minute,
Sheriff!

741
00:59:19,419 --> 00:59:22,217
Th-Th-That's the poor box!

742
00:59:22,288 --> 00:59:27,123
It sure is, and I'll just take it
for poor Prince John.

743
00:59:27,193 --> 00:59:29,218
Every little bit helps.

744
00:59:29,295 --> 00:59:32,958
Oooh,
you put that back!

745
00:59:33,032 --> 00:59:36,934
And His Majesty also
blesses you, little sister.

746
00:59:37,003 --> 00:59:39,335
You thievin' scoundrel!

747
00:59:39,405 --> 00:59:42,863
Now, take it easy, Friar.
I'm just doin' my duty.

748
00:59:42,942 --> 00:59:45,877
Collectin' taxes
for that arrogant,

749
00:59:45,945 --> 00:59:49,711
greedy, ruthless,
no-good Prince John?

750
00:59:49,782 --> 00:59:53,047
Listen, Friar,
you're mighty preachy,

751
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:56,987
and you're gonna preach your neck
right into a hangman's noose.

752
00:59:57,056 --> 00:59:58,990
Get out of my church!

753
00:59:59,058 --> 01:00:03,552
- Out! Out! Out! Out!
- Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.

754
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:05,530
Oh, dear me.

755
01:00:05,598 --> 01:00:07,998
You want taxes?

756
01:00:09,235 --> 01:00:12,830
- I'll give you taxes!
- Ow!

757
01:00:12,905 --> 01:00:15,840
Give it to him! Give it to him!
Give it to him, Friar!

758
01:00:23,082 --> 01:00:27,644
You're under arrest for high treason
to the crown.

759
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,348
Oh, no!

760
01:00:30,423 --> 01:00:32,584
Oh, there, there, Mother.

761
01:00:36,262 --> 01:00:38,492
Every town

762
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,535
Has its ups and downs

763
01:00:46,339 --> 01:00:48,671
Sometimes ups

764
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:54,211
Outnumber the downs

765
01:00:55,882 --> 01:00:58,942
But not in Nottingham

766
01:01:25,611 --> 01:01:29,547
Sire, if I may--

767
01:01:29,615 --> 01:01:31,549
may venture an opinion,

768
01:01:31,617 --> 01:01:35,883
you're not your usual
cheerful, genial self today.

769
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:42,485
I-I-I know. I know.

770
01:01:42,562 --> 01:01:45,895
You haven't counted your money
for days, hmm?

771
01:01:45,965 --> 01:01:48,729
It always makes you so happy.

772
01:01:52,138 --> 01:01:54,129
Sire,

773
01:01:54,207 --> 01:01:57,938
taxes are pouring in,
the jail is full.

774
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:01,002
And, oh,
I have good news, sire.

775
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:04,914
- Friar Tuck is in jail.
- Friar Tuck?

776
01:02:04,984 --> 01:02:09,683
It's Robin Hood I want,
you idiot!

777
01:02:09,756 --> 01:02:13,385
I'd give all my gold
if I could just get my hands--

778
01:02:16,062 --> 01:02:17,825
Did you say Friar Tuck?

779
01:02:17,897 --> 01:02:21,492
Did I?
Y-Y-Yes, I did.

780
01:02:22,568 --> 01:02:25,162
Ah!
Hiss, I have it!

781
01:02:25,238 --> 01:02:30,471
I'll use that fat friar as bait
to trap Robin Hood.

782
01:02:30,543 --> 01:02:32,511
Another trap?

783
01:02:32,578 --> 01:02:35,046
Yes, yes, you stupid serpent.

784
01:02:35,114 --> 01:02:40,177
Friar Tuck will be led to the gallows
in the village square, don't you see?

785
01:02:40,253 --> 01:02:45,520
B-B-But, sire, hang Friar Tuck,
a man of the church?

786
01:02:45,591 --> 01:02:48,526
Yes, my reluctant reptile.

787
01:02:48,594 --> 01:02:52,052
And when our elusive hero
tries to rescue...

788
01:02:52,131 --> 01:02:55,862
the corpulent cleric,

789
01:02:55,935 --> 01:02:58,460
my men will be ready.

790
01:03:18,257 --> 01:03:22,318
Well, Trigger, everything's
rigged up and all set.

791
01:03:22,395 --> 01:03:26,331
Yep, it's one of the prettiest scaffolds
you ever built, Sheriff.

792
01:03:26,399 --> 01:03:31,098
Sheriff, don't you reckon we oughta
give that there trapdoor a test?

793
01:03:35,374 --> 01:03:40,573
Criminently. Now I know why
your mama called you ''Nutsy.''

794
01:03:40,646 --> 01:03:43,274
Alms. Alms for the poor.

795
01:03:43,349 --> 01:03:47,080
Do me old ears
hear the melodious voice...

796
01:03:47,153 --> 01:03:49,087
of the sheriff?

797
01:03:49,155 --> 01:03:51,248
That's right, old man.

798
01:03:51,324 --> 01:03:54,259
What be going on here?

799
01:03:54,327 --> 01:03:56,591
We're gonna hang Friar Tuck.

800
01:03:56,662 --> 01:04:01,292
No! Hang Friar--
Hang Friar Tuck?

801
01:04:01,367 --> 01:04:03,562
You betcha. At dawn.

802
01:04:03,636 --> 01:04:06,070
And maybe it'll
even be a double hangin'.

803
01:04:07,139 --> 01:04:09,573
Shh, shh.
Dummy up, you dummy.

804
01:04:09,642 --> 01:04:13,840
A double hangin', eh?

805
01:04:13,913 --> 01:04:16,575
Who'll be the other one
who gets the rope?

806
01:04:16,649 --> 01:04:20,085
Sheriff, he's gettin'
too all-fired nosy.

807
01:04:20,152 --> 01:04:22,985
Oh, I didn't mean nothin'.

808
01:04:23,055 --> 01:04:25,751
But, um,
couldn't there be trouble...

809
01:04:25,825 --> 01:04:28,123
if Robin Hood showed up?

810
01:04:28,194 --> 01:04:32,927
Well, wouldn't you know,
Sheriff, he guessed it.

811
01:04:32,999 --> 01:04:35,263
Nutsy, button your beak.

812
01:04:35,334 --> 01:04:37,268
Ah, no need to worry.

813
01:04:37,336 --> 01:04:41,898
The sheriff be too crafty,
too clever and too smart...

814
01:04:41,974 --> 01:04:44,272
for the likes of him,
says I.

815
01:04:44,343 --> 01:04:46,777
Ya hear that, Nutsy?

816
01:04:46,846 --> 01:04:49,440
For bein' blind,
he sure knows a good man...

817
01:04:49,515 --> 01:04:52,746
when he sees one, says I.

818
01:04:52,818 --> 01:04:55,116
Sheriff,
I still got a feelin'...

819
01:04:55,187 --> 01:04:58,384
that that snoopy old codger
knows too much.

820
01:04:58,457 --> 01:05:02,621
Oh, shut up, Trigger.
He's just a harmless old blind beggar.

821
01:05:02,695 --> 01:05:04,720
Alms.

822
01:05:04,797 --> 01:05:08,096
Alms for the poor.
Alms.

823
01:05:08,167 --> 01:05:10,101
Alms for the poor.

824
01:05:10,169 --> 01:05:13,935
Rob, we can't let 'em
hang Friar Tuck.

825
01:05:14,006 --> 01:05:17,066
Ajailbreak tonight
is the only chance he's got.

826
01:05:17,143 --> 01:05:20,408
Ajailbreak? There ain't
no way you can get him.

827
01:05:20,479 --> 01:05:24,617
We've got to, Johnny,
or Friar Tuck dies at dawn.

828
01:06:23,275 --> 01:06:28,406
1 :00, and all's well!

829
01:06:34,853 --> 01:06:38,846
Nutsy, you'd better set your brains
ahead a couple of hours.

830
01:06:38,924 --> 01:06:44,191
Yes, sir. Uh, does that there mean
addin' or subtractin'?

831
01:06:44,263 --> 01:06:49,633
- Oh, let's forget it.
- Yes, sir, Sheriff, sir.

832
01:06:49,702 --> 01:06:54,537
Nutsy, how can I sleep with you yelling
''All's well'' all the time here?

833
01:06:54,606 --> 01:06:57,541
Sheriff, everything
ain't ''all's well.''

834
01:06:57,609 --> 01:07:00,976
I got a feelin' in my bones there's
gonna be a jailbreak any minute.

835
01:07:01,046 --> 01:07:04,846
Criminently, Trigger!
Point that peashooter the other way.

836
01:07:04,917 --> 01:07:08,876
Don't you worry none, Sheriff.
The safety's on Old Betsy.

837
01:07:13,058 --> 01:07:16,323
What in tarnation
you tryin' to do,

838
01:07:16,395 --> 01:07:18,989
-you birdbrain?
-Just doin' my duty, Sheriff.

839
01:07:19,064 --> 01:07:22,556
You and that itchy
trigger finger of yours.

840
01:07:29,975 --> 01:07:32,705
- Hey, did you hear that?
- Sure did, Trigger.

841
01:07:32,778 --> 01:07:36,270
There's something funny
going on around here. Come on.

842
01:07:36,348 --> 01:07:38,441
You cover me.

843
01:07:42,855 --> 01:07:46,791
Wait a minute.
Is the safety on Old Betsy?

844
01:07:46,859 --> 01:07:49,760
- You bet it is, Sheriff.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

845
01:07:49,828 --> 01:07:51,853
You go first.

846
01:07:53,866 --> 01:07:58,360
All right, you in there,
come out with your hands up.

847
01:07:58,437 --> 01:08:01,099
Yeah, reach for the sky.

848
01:08:01,173 --> 01:08:05,109
-Just you watch this
''preformance'', partner.
- Be careful, Rob.

849
01:08:07,479 --> 01:08:12,382
Jehoshaphat, Trigger.
Put that peashooter down.

850
01:08:12,451 --> 01:08:16,114
Aw, shucks, Trigger,
it's only Nutsy.

851
01:08:16,188 --> 01:08:19,316
And criminently,
get back to your patrol.

852
01:08:19,391 --> 01:08:22,360
- On the double. Get!
- I'm a-gettin'.

853
01:08:22,427 --> 01:08:26,386
That Trigger.
He's gettin' everybody edgy.

854
01:08:26,465 --> 01:08:29,093
Nothing's gonna happen.
That fat friar...

855
01:08:29,168 --> 01:08:33,002
is gonna dangle from
the gallows come daybreak.

856
01:08:34,273 --> 01:08:36,332
Sheriff,

857
01:08:36,408 --> 01:08:41,675
why don't you just sit yourself
down here kind of cozy-like?

858
01:08:41,747 --> 01:08:43,681
Well, thank you, Nutsy.

859
01:08:43,749 --> 01:08:46,980
Just close your sleepy
little eyeballs.

860
01:08:47,052 --> 01:08:50,021
The sandman's a-comin'.

861
01:08:52,257 --> 01:08:55,852
Why don't you, uh,
let me loosen that belt?

862
01:08:55,928 --> 01:08:58,897
Rock-a-bye, Sheriff

863
01:08:58,964 --> 01:09:01,626
Just you relax

864
01:09:23,255 --> 01:09:25,849
Oh, Nutsy,
that's mighty sweet.

865
01:09:25,924 --> 01:09:28,085
Sing it one more time,
would you?

866
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,993
Rock-a-bye, Sheriff

867
01:09:31,063 --> 01:09:34,794
Just you relax

868
01:09:45,244 --> 01:09:48,213
Wait a minute!
Jailbreak! Jailbreak!

869
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:51,249
I heard it! I heard it, Sheriff!
The door! The door!

870
01:09:54,353 --> 01:09:58,949
- Now, for the last time,
no more false alarms.
- Ow!

871
01:09:59,024 --> 01:10:01,720
Now, you release Friar Tuck
and the others...

872
01:10:01,793 --> 01:10:04,261
and I'll drop in
on the royal treasury.

873
01:10:14,439 --> 01:10:17,636
Oh, Little John,
it can't be!

874
01:10:17,709 --> 01:10:22,112
-Shh, quiet. We're bustin' out of here.
-Thank God.

875
01:10:23,181 --> 01:10:25,115
My prayers have been answered.

876
01:10:43,835 --> 01:10:48,329
- I'm ready. Where's the bad guys?
- Take it easy, son.

877
01:11:36,655 --> 01:11:38,748
Robin Hood!

878
01:11:38,824 --> 01:11:43,022
I'll get even. I'll get--

879
01:12:16,728 --> 01:12:19,356
It's Robin Hood I--
I want.

880
01:13:13,151 --> 01:13:16,382
Praise the Lord
and pass the tax rebate!

881
01:13:16,455 --> 01:13:19,083
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

882
01:13:19,157 --> 01:13:21,717
Come on. Follow me.

883
01:13:39,745 --> 01:13:42,737
Now, Sheriff--
Now, don't get your dander up,

884
01:13:42,814 --> 01:13:45,248
but I still got
a feelin' that--

885
01:13:46,318 --> 01:13:49,754
Friar, get goin'.
Hurry.

886
01:14:44,643 --> 01:14:49,239
Ooo-oooh!

887
01:14:52,551 --> 01:14:56,988
Guards! Guards!
My gold!

888
01:15:06,331 --> 01:15:10,825
Oh, no, no, no.
They're getting away with my gold.

889
01:15:10,902 --> 01:15:13,200
Guards! Guards!

890
01:15:13,271 --> 01:15:15,535
To the jail!

891
01:15:15,607 --> 01:15:18,906
Rhinos, halt!
Stop! Desist!

892
01:15:23,615 --> 01:15:26,209
Everybody, this way!

893
01:16:02,954 --> 01:16:05,718
That's all of them.
Get going.

894
01:16:10,128 --> 01:16:14,861
This ain't no hayride.
Let's move it out of here. Ho-ooo!

895
01:16:14,933 --> 01:16:17,868
On to Sherwood Forest!

896
01:16:17,936 --> 01:16:19,870
Stop! My baby!

897
01:16:19,938 --> 01:16:22,532
Mama, Mama, wait for me.

898
01:16:36,621 --> 01:16:40,455
- We got him now!
- Keep going. Don't worry about me.

899
01:17:17,295 --> 01:17:20,560
This time,
we got him for sure.

900
01:17:54,566 --> 01:17:56,329
Shoot him!

901
01:18:09,414 --> 01:18:12,815
Kill him! Kill him!

902
01:18:23,895 --> 01:18:27,160
Come on, Rob. Come on.

903
01:18:27,232 --> 01:18:29,826
He's just gotta make it.

904
01:18:35,907 --> 01:18:39,502
No! No. No.

905
01:18:39,578 --> 01:18:42,809
Hiss, he's finished!
Done for!

906
01:18:42,881 --> 01:18:45,509
La, la, la

907
01:18:47,586 --> 01:18:49,850
He's gonna make it,

908
01:18:49,921 --> 01:18:52,515
isn't he, Little John?

909
01:19:10,242 --> 01:19:12,733
Hey, what's that?

910
01:19:15,347 --> 01:19:18,214
Little John, look it!
Look it!

911
01:19:21,186 --> 01:19:23,211
Hey, what the--

912
01:19:23,288 --> 01:19:27,554
Oh, man, did you have me worried, Rob.

913
01:19:27,626 --> 01:19:29,753
I thought you were long gone.

914
01:19:29,828 --> 01:19:32,820
Ah, not Robin Hood.

915
01:19:32,897 --> 01:19:37,800
He could've swum twice that far,
huh, Mr. Robin Hood, sir?

916
01:19:37,869 --> 01:19:42,465
Look, Friar! Look!
He's made it. He got away again.

917
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:47,307
A pox on that phony King of England!
Oo-de-lally!

918
01:19:47,379 --> 01:19:52,146
- Oo-de-lally!
- Oh, no. It's so miserably unfair.

919
01:19:52,217 --> 01:19:55,983
Well, I tried to tell you,
but, no, no, no, you wouldn't listen.

920
01:19:56,054 --> 01:20:00,684
Your traps never work, and look what
you've done to your mother's castle.

921
01:20:00,759 --> 01:20:04,160
Mommy !

922
01:20:06,631 --> 01:20:10,761
- Sire, no!
- You cowardly cobra!

923
01:20:10,835 --> 01:20:13,099
Please! Oh, no!

924
01:20:13,171 --> 01:20:16,106
Procrastinating python!

925
01:20:17,676 --> 01:20:22,010
- Aggravating asp!
- Save me!

926
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,981
You eel in snake's clothing!

927
01:20:25,050 --> 01:20:29,544
Help!
He's gone stark raving mad!

928
01:20:46,338 --> 01:20:49,501
You know, I thought we'd never
get rid of those two rascals,

929
01:20:49,575 --> 01:20:53,067
but lucky for us folks,
King Richard returned,

930
01:20:53,145 --> 01:20:56,171
and, well, he just
straightened everything out.

931
01:21:03,923 --> 01:21:06,187
Oooh. Aaah.

932
01:21:09,428 --> 01:21:13,330
Say, we'd better get over to the church.
Sounds like somebody's gettin' hitched.

933
01:21:17,102 --> 01:21:19,866
Long live Robin Hood!

934
01:21:26,078 --> 01:21:28,603
Long live King Richard!

935
01:21:29,748 --> 01:21:31,716
Oh, Friar Tuck,

936
01:21:31,784 --> 01:21:36,118
it appears that I now have
an outlaw for an in-law.

937
01:21:38,090 --> 01:21:40,024
Yes, not bad.

938
01:21:44,597 --> 01:21:47,862
Gee, Skippy,
how come you're goin'?

939
01:21:47,933 --> 01:21:50,731
Well, Robin Hood's
gonna have kids,

940
01:21:50,803 --> 01:21:53,533
so somebody's gotta keep
their eye on things.

941
01:21:56,275 --> 01:21:58,209
Ho-ooo!

942
01:21:58,277 --> 01:22:00,939
Ohhh.

943
01:22:01,013 --> 01:22:04,380
I've never been so happy.

944
01:22:22,134 --> 01:22:24,694
Hey, here come the bride,
Trigger.

945
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:27,705
Present arms!

946
01:22:35,664 --> 01:22:41,193
Well, folks,
that's the way it really happened.

947
01:22:41,269 --> 01:22:47,765
Love goes on and on

948
01:22:47,843 --> 01:22:51,040
Oo-de-lally, Oo-de-lally
Golly, what a day

949
01:22:51,113 --> 01:22:57,814
Oo-de-lally, Oo-de-lally
Golly, what a day
