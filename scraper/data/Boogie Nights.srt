39
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,908

Wanna come back to the table

00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,581
Uh, I'd love to, but I gotta work.

00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,334
You have to work, get money,

Seventeen-year-old piece of gold.

Yeah.

99
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,287
I got a feeling, beneath those jeans there's
something wonderful just waiting to get out.

100
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,718
- Hey, guys.

No. I'm going to sleep. Good night.

112
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,922
Good night, honey-tits. Sleep beautiful.

113
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,590
Okay.

114
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,335
Tom? Hi. Yeah, it's me.

115
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,879
I know that it's late, but I--

116
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,340
Is Andy there? Is he?

117
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,010
I'd like to say hello.

118
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:18,056
I'd like to say hello to my son,
and that's all.

119
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,104
Let me tell you something.

120
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,691
Let me tell you something you don't know.
I know a lawyer. You understand?

121
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:31,987
You might think l don't, but l do,
and l'll take you to court.

122
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:40,996
Tom, don't. Come on, Tom.
Please. Please. Please.

123
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,223
What the fuck are you doing?

124
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,061
What the fuck does it look like l'm doing?

125
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,395
Can you close the door?

126
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,815
Will l close the door?

127
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,152
Will l close the door?
That's my wife, you asshole.

128
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,572
Uh, I'm sorry.

129
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,326
Get out. Go sleep on the couch.

130
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,953
Don't stop, big stud.

131
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,843
Yeah. That's right.

132
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,504
Oh, Jesus, please, okay?
Shave if you're gonna do that.

133
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,882
-You scratch my face.
-Sorry.

134
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,432
-Good morning.
-Hey.

135
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:36,272
How's it at work?
You get home late, huh?

136
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,234
-Yeah.
-You know, you work in a nightclub.

137
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,237
If it means so much to you,
you should find one that's closer.

138
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,446
Yeah.

139
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,075
I gotta get to work.

140
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,452
-At a car wash.
-What?

141
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,913
You work at a car wash.
You work at a nightclub.

142
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,082
School never occurred to you?

143
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,887
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

144
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:14,602
So basically, you're getting
twice the bass with the TK-421 ...

145
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,313
...which we've, uh, got available
in this system right here.

146
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:21,442
l don't know.
I don't really know if l need all that bass.

147
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,945
Oh, l think you need all that bass.

148
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,614
Heh, I mean, if you want a system
to handle what you want...

149
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,117
...yeah, you need the bass.

150
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:33,288
See, this-- This is hi-fi, okay?

151
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,249
High fidelity. Know what that means?

152
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,460
That means
this is the highest quality fidelity.

153
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:43,423
Hi-fi. Those are two very important things
to have in a stereo system.

154
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,844
-lt's the price. For the 420--
-l have this very unit in my home.

155
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,804
-Really?
-Yes, I do.

156
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,473
Of course, I got it modified
with the TK-421 ...

157
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,475
...which, uh, kicks it up another...

158
00:14:54,643 --> 00:15:00,523
...l don't know, maybe three or four, um,
quads per channel, you know.

159
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:04,235
But that's really-- That's technical talk.
That doesn't really concern you.

160
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,238
Still a little uncertain, aren't you?

161
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,656
-Yeah.
- Yeah.

162
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,242
You know what you need?
You need a test drive.

163
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,411
That's what you need.
You need a test drive.

164
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,874
It's one thing to hear it from Buck's mouth,
it's another to hear it from the TK-421 .

165
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,918
So let me just pop in this 8-track...

166
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,462
...and you just give a listen,
tell me what you think, okay?

167
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,592
Whoo. Huh?

168
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,887
You hear that? You hear the bass? Right?

169
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,680
You hear it? It kicks.

170
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:37,810
It turns. It curls up your belly.
Makes you wanna freaky-deaky, right?

171
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,897
Heh, you got that?
Now, see, if you get this system as is...

172
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,192
...it's not gonna sound like this
without the TK-421 modification...

173
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,528
...and we do that in the store right here,
very small price.

174
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,740
Go on and move with it if you need to.
It helps me.

175
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,368
Thank you for your time.

176
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,579
Oh, okay. Well, hey. So long, partner.

177
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,124
-What the fuck was that?
-What?

178
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,876
-Have I told you?
-Have-- What?

179
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,962
-Have I?
-l don't know what you're talking about.

180
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,924
You put on that country-western shit,
no one's gonna buy a stereo.

181
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,677
What kind of brother are you, anyway?
Listening to that shit.

182
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,346
-All right. Look, Jerry--
-No, no, no. You look.

183
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,390
I gave you a job here because,
you know...

184
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:19,394
...l thought your acting stuff might bring
some nice pussy into the place, and it has.

185
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:23,564
But l can't have any more fuckups.
You dig?

186
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:24,774
Yeah.

187
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,776
-You dig?
-Yeah. I dig.

188
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:30,279
Okay, now get in the back
and, uh, unload those new 484s.

189
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,949
All right. Sorry, I was just--

190
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,910
Settle down, class. Settle down.

191
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,621
This is your final.

192
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:42,583
Keep your test papers face down
until I tell you to turn them up.

193
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,420
Clear your tables, please.

194
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:49,674
There should be nothing on your desk
but your test paper and a pencil.

195
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:54,387
We're covering chapters 17 through 28.

196
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:58,766
Your eyes should stay on your test paper,
please.

197
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,977
Are we ready?

198
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,479
Class, begin.

199
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:34,218
I love to suck cock. l love to suck cock.

200
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:51,152
Honey? You okay?
Sweetheart? ls something wrong?

201
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,990
- I gotta get back.
- I need it once more.

202
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,160
- I have to go back to work.
-Come on. Give it to me, Eddie.

203
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,162
Don't make me pounce you, Sheryl Lynn.

204
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,247
-Ooh, baby, baby, baby.
-l'll do it.

205
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,792
-You promise?
-Oh, that's it.

206
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,418
-You want it?
-Yeah.

207
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,170
-How bad?
-Bad.

208
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,005
-You sure?
-Yeah.

209
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,173
You asked for it.

210
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,346
Oh, God. Wait.

211
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,558
Stop. Stop.

212
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,352
What?

213
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,235
Your cock is so beautiful.

214
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,153
Yeah?

215
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,031
Do you know how good you are
at doing it, Eddie?

216
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,993
Having sex? Fucking me?
Making love to me?

217
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,289
Everyone has one thing, you think?

218
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,959
I mean, everyone's given
one special thing, right?

219
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,961
That's right.

220
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,590
Everyone's blessed
with one special thing.

221
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,261
Hey.

222
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,766
I want you to know l plan on being a star.

223
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,394
A big, bright shining star.

224
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:10,273
That's what l want.
That's what l'm gonna get.

225
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,191
I know.

226
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,152
I gotta go.

227
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,446
You're lucky.

228
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,402
Hi.

229
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,320
- Eddie.
-Hi.

230
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,821
- Want a ride?
-Jack?

231
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:44,659
- Yeah. Want a ride?
-Hi. Uh, well, l'm going really far.

232
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,245
Do you remember me
from a couple hours ago?

233
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,413
Yeah, l remember.

234
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,541
Come with us, sweetie.

235
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,585
Okay.

236
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,551
This is a really cool car, Jack.

237
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,184
So, what I'm trying to tell you, Eddie...

238
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:15,314
...is that it takes a lot
of the good, old American green stuff...

239
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,484
...to make one of these things,
you know what l mean?

240
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:22,530
I mean, you know, you've got your camera,
you've got your film...

241
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,908
...you got your lights, you got your sound,
you got your lab costs...

242
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,412
...you got your developing,
you got your synching, you got your editing.

243
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:36,294
Before you turn around, you've spent
maybe 20-, 25-, $30,000 on a movie.

244
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,422
-Wow, that's a lot of money.
-You bet your ass it is.

245
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,382
But if you make a good one...

246
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,719
...there's practically no end
to how much money you can make.

247
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,555
-Have you seen Jack's house?
- No.

248
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,850
-He will.
- He'll see it.

249
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,186
You got maybe 15, 20 guys
standing around...

250
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:57,940
...just making sure
that your lighting is right.

251
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,444
But you can work out in the morning,
you can work out at noon...

252
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,487
...you can work out at night.

253
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,782
It doesn't matter
if you don't have those juices flowing...

254
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:11,746
...down there in the Mr. Torpedo area,
in the fun zone...

255
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,415
...but you gotta get the people
in the theater.

256
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,751
You know, you need the big dicks,
the big tits.

257
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,378
Uh-oh. Here we go.

258
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:23,090
How do you keep them in the theater
after they've come?

259
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,509
With beauty...

260
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,804
...and with acting.

261
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:33,517
Now, l understand you've gotta
get them in the theater, you know?

262
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,102
You gotta keep the seats full.

263
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,273
But l don't wanna make a film
where they show up, they sit down...

264
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,818
...they jack off, and they get up
and they get out before the story ends.

265
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:48,616
It is my dream, it is my goal,
it is my idea to make a film...

266
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,787
...that the story just sucks them in...

267
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:58,125
...and when they spurt out that joy juice,
they just gotta sit in it.

268
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:04,757
They can't move
until they find out how the story ends.

269
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:09,637
You know, aah,
I wanna make a film like that.

270
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,264
And l understand,
you know, they have to make films--

271
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:15,976
I've made them myself,
you know, that are a few laughs...

272
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,522
...everybody fucks their brains out,
and that's fine.

273
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:23,818
But it's my dream to make a film...

274
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,113
...that is true...

275
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:31,951
...and right and dramatic.

276
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,954
You sure you don't want a Fresca?

277
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,539
-No, thanks.
-Are you sure?

278
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,833
-Yeah.
-You're out of limes, Jack.

279
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,752
Well, check in the kitchen, darling.

280
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,506
I'm going to bed.

281
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,843
Good night, Jackie.
Don't stay up too late.

282
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,845
Good night, beauty.

283
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,222
-Good night, Eddie.
-Good night.

284
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,433
Glad you came by.

285
00:23:57,352 --> 00:24:00,271
-You're great.
-Oh, thank you.

286
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,027
She's the best.

287
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,239
She's a wonderful mother, you know?

288
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,701
She's a mother
to all those who need love.

289
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,537
-She's really nice.
-Yeah.

290
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:22,835
You know what l'm thinking? l'm thinking,
I wanna be in business with you, Eddie.

291
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,504
-Really?
-Yeah. What do you think?

292
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,548
I'd love it.

293
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,509
What do you think of Rollergirl?

294
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,345
-She's great.
-Yeah.

295
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,307
-Would you like to do it?
-Have sex?

296
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,977
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, yeah. l mean, I'd love to.

297
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,397
-She's really foxy.
-Oh, you bet your ass she is.

298
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,399
You're officially out of limes, Jack.

299
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,068
Well, l'll pick up some for you
tomorrow or something.

300
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,361
Come here, darling.

301
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:53,532
I want you to go over there
and sit on the couch with Eddie.

302
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,618
Here we go. Are we gonna fuck?

303
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:59,705
-Oh, yes.
-Ha, ha. Wait a minute.

304
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,762
-Are you ready?
- Yeah. Are you?

305
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,764
Oh, yeah.

306
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,436
Are you gonna take your skates off

307
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,064
I don't take my skates off.

308
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,274
-And don't fucking come in.

-Nowhere.
-Shut up. Where were you?

312
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:04,645
You see that little slut girl you see?
Sheryl? Sheryl Lynn?

313
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,564
Don't say that.

314
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,984
Make you feel like a stud
to see trash like that?

315
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,821
-She your girlfriend?
-No, she's not my girlfr--

316
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:17,157
She's a little whore
and a little piece of trash.

317
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,994
And l know
you're not the only one she sees.

318
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:23,706
-Why would you say something like that?
-l heard things about her, that girl.

319
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:26,458
Don't think I don't know what goes on
when l'm not here.

320

I wash your sheets. I know she's been here.
Or you doing something else in there...

321
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,840

and your posters on the wall?

322
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,176
-What is your problem?
-Okay, fine. All right. Just go.

323
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:39,179

Why don't you just go to her?

324

-Yeah. Well, maybe l will.
-Yeah?

325

326
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,769
- I don't know. I'll do something.
- You can't do anything.

327
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,272
You're a loser. You'll always be a loser.

328
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,442
You couldn't even finish high school
because you were so stupid.

329
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,736
-So, what are you gonna do?

330
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,739
I'll go somewhere.
I'll run away where you can never find me.

331
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,616
Go ahead and fuck that little girl.

332
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:04,330
-What do you think you're doing?
-l'm getting my stuff.

333
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:08,208
You think that's your stuff
That's not your stuff. You didn't pay for it.

334
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:11,587
That is not your stuff
because you didn't pay for it, stupid!

335
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,423
None of this is yours! This--

You leave here,

Nothing! Nothing!

You understand me?
You want to treat me like this?

339
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,686
-This is what happens, okay?
- I didn't do anything.

340
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:30,105
You want to live that way?
Fuck that little whore!

341
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:33,400
You think you're gonna be this?
You think you're gonna be this?

342
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:34,943
Goddamn poster!

343
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:38,030
Don't do that! Don't do that!
Why are you doing that?

344
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,574
You're not gonna be shit
because you're too stupid!

345
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,618
-l'm not stupid!
-Yes, you are!

346
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:46,246
Please, please. Don't fucking do that.
Please don't be mean to me.

347
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:49,166
I'm not being mean to you.
You're just too stupid to see it.

348
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:53,253
You don't know what I can do,
what I'm gonna do, or what l'm gonna be.

349
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,465
You don't know. l'm good.
I have good things you don't know about.

350

351
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,761
-Don't fucking tell me I'm not!
-You can't do anything.

352
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:04,431
Don't be mean!
And you don't talk to me! No!

353

414
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,596
Hi. This is my lady friend.

415
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:34,433
Darling, l'd like you to meet Jack Horner,
the finest director in the business.

416
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,642
-Hi.
-Hi.

417
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,436
Do you have any coke at this party?

418
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,314
-They can find some somewhere. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

419
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,482
-Great.
- You're no bigger than a minute?

420
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,650
Uh-uh. Ha, ha.

421
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,569
- Shy as a butterfly.
- I'll bet.

422
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:50,073
He has every right to tell me
how to sell stereos. lt's his store, I'll listen.

423
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,576
He does not have the right
to tell me how to dress.

424
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,703
Where's he get off
telling me how to dress, huh?

425
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,664
-lt's old. lt's just plain old.
-No, wait. Let me tell you--

426
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,917
He was obviously pissed off
about the music.

427
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:03,253
-What's wrong with it?
-The cowboy look ended six years ago.

428
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,673
-lt's coming back though, Becky.
-No, it's not. lt's over. lt's dead, okay?

429
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,842
I don't think you know
what you're talking about.

430
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,011
I do know what l'm talking about.

431
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,847
Your bosses at the stereo store
are saying the same thing.

432
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:17,017
-What? What?
-You have to get a new look.

433
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,019
What? You get a new look.

434
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,480
I have a look, okay?
The look l have is just fine.

435
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,524
-What's your look?
-Chocolate love, all right?

436
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,443
-Oh, take a pill.
-One hundred percent.

437
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,237
You don't have to lash out.
I'm trying to be your friend.

438
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:32,532
-Okay, Becky. Drop it.
-l tried opening up a club there, you know?

439
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,328
But you see, Miss Amber, l'm just this
poor fellow from Puerto Rico, you know?

440
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,372
I got this club. Yeah, that's one thing.

441
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:41,833
But soon that goes, l die,
then what do l have? I got nothing.

442
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,043
Mm-hm.

443
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,462
You know, I want something
I can send home, you know?

444
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:50,425
Something l can send to my brothers
and say, "Look at me.

445
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:53,887
Look at me and all the beautiful women
I've been with."

446
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,556
So what? You want me to talk to Jack?

447
00:32:56,724 --> 00:33:00,435
Yeah. l mean, you know.
I mean, what am l asking you here?

448
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,813
Honey, Amber, baby, please, talk to Jack.

449
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,399
Tell him l can do this.
Tell him l won't be bad.

450
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:08,110
-So you wanna be in a movie?
-Baby, please.

451
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,529
-l'll see what I can do.
-Would you, love?

452
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,280
Thank you very much.

453
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,490
Thank you, mamita.

454
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:19,788
Maurice, can I talk to you?
I need to talk to you now.

455
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,082
- Now?
- Yeah. We gotta go in here.

456
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,917
- Excuse me.
-Hi.

457
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,086
Can l join in?

458
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:27,879
Most certainly.

459
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:31,550
- Your cowboy--? That's not dead.
- Then what is Becky talking about?

460
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,553
- She's got something up her ass.
- Fuck that shit.

461
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,346
Bitch.

462
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:58,118
-Do a cannonball.
- No, no. Watch this jackknife.

463
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,793
- Did it look cool?
-That was pretty good.

464
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:09,087
Let me show you what you did wrong.

465
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,852
Full flip.

466
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,070
Whoa.

467
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:40,827
Ow.

468
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,288
-You all right?
-Yeah.

469
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:46,208
Hey, you gotta bring your legs
all the way around.

470
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:49,127
I know. I know.

471
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,047
-Hey, hey, hey. This is my point.
-What?

472
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,049
-Okay, you know what I say?
-What?

473
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,134
Wear what you dig.

474
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,887
That's it. Just wear what you dig.

475
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:02,140
-That's what I said.
-Well, what's the problem?

476
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,686
-Should l get that?
-Yeah.

477
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:10,065
Hello? Uh-huh.

478
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,400
Uh, can you speak a little louder, please?

479
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,987
A who? A Ma--? A Maggie.
You know a Maggie?

480
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:19,950
-l don't know a Maggie.
-Uh, look, sorry. There's no Maggie here.

481
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:24,830
Your-- Your mother. Oh, okay.
Just give me a sec.

482
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:27,332
Watch that for me, okay?

483
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:33,547
Uh, excuse me, is Maggie here?
Maggie? Are you Maggie?

484
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:37,175
No? Do you know?
Maggie, Maggie, Maggie.

485
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,010
Do you know Maggie?

486
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,473
-Are you Maggie?
-No.

487
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,351
Oh, man. Can you believe this?

488
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:50,105
Hello? Yeah, listen.
I'm sorry, there's no Maggie here.

489
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:53,817
Okay. No, no. lt's not a problem.
Okay. Ciao.

490
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:58,113
-Who was that?
-Oh, some kid looking for his mom.

491
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,414
-What the fuck are you doing?
-What's it look like they're doing?

492
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,749
That's my wife.

493
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:54,878
Shut up, Bill. You're embarrassing me.

494
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,714
Yeah, Little Bill. Shut up.

495
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,520
-Little Bill.
-Hey, Kurt. How's it going?

496
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:15,607
-What's wrong with you?
-Oh, my fucking wife, man.

497
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,734
She's down there,
some idiot's dick in her.

498
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:21,154
Everybody's standing around watching.
It's a fucking embarrassment.

499
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,657
Yeah, yeah. l know. Anyway, listen.

500
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,159
-Yeah.
-For the shoot, I wanna talk about the look.

501
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,411
-See about getting this new zoom lens.
-Right.

502
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,498
I was wondering if we'd be able
to look into getting more lights.

503
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,041
Jack wants a minimal thing.

504
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:36,670
Yeah, well, very often minimal means
a lot more photographically, I think--

505
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:39,506
-Well, l think than most people understand.
-l understand.

506
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,592
No, I know you understand.
I'm talking about some other people.

507
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,262
I think what Jack is talking about
is minimal.

508
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,389
Not really natural, but minimal.

509
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:50,225
-Okay, fine. Uh, l was just saying--
-l understand.

510
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:53,186
Yeah, because I'm trying
to give each picture its own look.

511
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:56,356
-Can we talk about this later?
-Oh, yeah.

512
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,817
You gotta go somewhere, or...?

513
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,444
Yeah. No. l mean, unh--

514
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,446
I was hoping for the shoot tomorrow...

515
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,032
...we could send Rocky down
and he could pick it up.

516
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,909
-Kurt.
-No, hey. Got you.

517
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,203
You gotta go somewhere,
so, hey, what the fuck?

518
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:13,039
It's only the photography of the film
we're talking about.

519
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:16,960
-Are you giving me shit, Kurt?
-No. Hey, no way, Little Bill.

520
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,380
My fucking wife has an ass in her cock
in the driveway, Kurt.

521
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,550
All right? l'm sorry if my thoughts
are not on the photography...

522
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:27,721
-...of the film we're shooting tomorrow.
-Okay. No big deal. Sorry.

523
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,765
-All right?
-Gotcha.

524
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,031
All right, where is it?

525
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,081
I think she's sick.

526
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,252
-Oh, what the fuck is this?
- l didn't do anything. l-- I didn't--

527
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,546
-ls she breathing?
-l don't know.

528
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,716
-l think maybe she did too much coke.
-Do you think so, doctor?

529
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,218
-This girl's definitely OD'd.
-Oh, fuck me. Okay.

530
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:09,220
I want you to handle this for me, Johnny.

531
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:10,472
-You listening?
- Yeah.

532
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:14,893
Get her in the car, drive her to Saint Joe's.
Drop her off in the front. l don't want any--

533
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,812
- Got you.
- Make sure no one sees the limo.

534
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,523
-Got it.
-What the fuck is this?

535
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:24,277
This is twice in two days
that a chick has OD'd on me.

536
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,447
You think maybe you ought to
think about getting some new shit?

537
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,656
- Yes, sir.
-Ah.

538
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:32,118
-Oh, shit. She's freaking out.
-Oh, see? Look at this.

539
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,746
With all this fucking conversation.
Come on. Come on.

540
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:37,874
-Please don't die.
-Hey, hey.

541
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,959
Come on!

542
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,964
-Back door, Johnny.
- You got it.

543
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,175
Fucking shit.

544
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,723
Get out of my way.

545
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:58,186
- Bart, is she all right?
- Shut the fuck up.

546
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:30,301
-Hey, Reed.
- Hey, Scotty J. How are you?

547
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:33,513
You know, you know. Ha, ha, who's this?

548
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:37,183
Eddie, this is Scotty J. He's a friend.
He works on some of the films.

549
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,102
-Nice to meet you.
-Oh, yeah. Me too.

550
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,895
Uh, you gonna be working, or...?

551
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,856
- Um, maybe.
-Oh.

552
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,859
-Probably. Ha, ha.
- That's great. Ha, ha.

553
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:49,279
How'd you meet Jack? Because I work
on the films, you know, sometimes.

554
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,906
-So if you ever, yeah....
- Hey, Eddie.

555
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:56,286
-Come here a second.
-That's the boy you told me about.

556
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,705
Uh, could you excuse me for a minute?

557
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,874
- Yeah.
-Very nice to meet you.

558
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,126
-Take care.
-Yeah.

559
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,590
-Hey.
-Eddie Adams, this is the Colonel.

560
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,717
-Hi.
- How do you do, Eddie?

561
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,219
Eddie is, uh, interested in film.

562
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:17,056
Oh. l can't give you much advice
that Jack probably doesn't know...

563
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:19,684
...but l can advise
that you think about your name.

564
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:20,894
My name. Yeah.

565
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,897
Like, think about some name
that makes you happy.

566
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:26,649
-Something with a little pizzazz, you know?
- Sure.

567
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:32,322
You see, Eddie, the Colonel here,
he puts up all the money for our films.

568
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,741
It's an important part of the process.

569
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,660
-Oh. Great, great.
-l'm looking forward to seeing you in action.

570
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:41,915
-Jack says you got a great big cock.
-Um, well, heh, l don't know. I guess so.

571
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,833
May I see it?

572
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,960
- Really?
-Please. Yeah.

573
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,754
Okay.

574
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,054
-Well, thank you, Eddie.
- No problem.

575
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,765
- Thanks, Eddie.
- Bye.

576
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,752
- You wanna hear a poem l wrote?
- Yeah.

577
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,420
Okay.

578
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:35,927
l love you, you love me
Going down the sugar tree

579
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:40,974
We'll go down the sugar tree
And see lots of bees

580
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:44,352
Playing, playing

581
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:48,815
But the bees won't sting
Because you love me

582
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,401
-That's it.
-That's fucking great. Did you write that?

583
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:55,488
-Yeah. I write songs too. l'm still working--
How's it going, boys?

584
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,740
Hey, Jack.

585
00:42:58,617 --> 00:42:59,659
Having a good time?

586
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,328
Excellent time. Thank you, Jack.
It was a great party.

587
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:05,790
-The best.
-Ah, that's what Jackie's house is for.

588
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,834
To have a good time. Right?

589
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,502
-That's right.
-Coming in.

590
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,673
- Woo-hoo. Ha, ha.
-Ha, ha.

591
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,052
- Ah, how about a little bubbles?
- Oh, yeah.

592
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:22,473
-Excuse me, Jack.
- Yeah?

593
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:25,393
I was thinking about what the Colonel
was saying, about my name.

594
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:28,187
- Uh-huh.
-l was just wondering if you had any ideas.

595
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:31,774
I had some thoughts on it, yeah.
What about you? What do you think?

596
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:35,528
Well, my idea was--
You know, I just want a name--

597
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,364
I want it so it can cut glass,
you know, like razor-sharp.

598
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,824
Razor-sharp. Right.

599
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:43,870
Yeah, well, when I close my eyes,
I see this thing. lt's like this big sign.

600
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,539
And the name is in,
like, bright-blue neon lights...

601
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,042
...with, like, purple outline.

602
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:54,005
And this name is just so bright and so sharp
that the sign, it just blows up...

603
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:57,216
...because the name is just so powerful.

604
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,311
It says, "Dirk Diggler."

605
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:13,733
I think-- I think heaven has sent you here,
Dirk Diggler.

606
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:18,821
I think the angels have blessed us all
because of you.

607
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:22,283
- You're Dirk. Ha, ha.
-Dirk Diggler, ha, ha.

608
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,410
Amen.

-There's shadows in life, baby.

612
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,093

613
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:44,389
-You, uh, wanna go over this?

614
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:48,017
Uh, the setup is-- Okay, here we go.

00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,103
Uh, "One, Amber talking to Becky.

616
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:53,231
They make the telephone call to the agents
to send over some actors.

617
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:58,903
Two, enter Reed to audition for Amber.
They go at it. Becky watches.

618
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,739
Three, Becky goes to the bathroom
to jack off.

619
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:04,575
She gets interrupted by Amber.
They go at it.

620

Four...."

621

Who's "Dirk--? Dirk Diggler?"

00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:14,043
That's that new, good-looking kid.

623
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,294
-Good name.
-Yeah.

624
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:18,297
Anyway, uh, "Enter Dirk. He meets Becky.
They go at it."

625
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:22,802
No, ugh. Change that, will you? Uh--
I want Eddie to be auditioning for Amber.

626

-Darling, where are you going?
-Huh? l gotta go wash my vagina.

628
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:30,685

629
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,687

-You got the lines for the scene?
-Uh-huh.

690
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:58,726
If you drop one, just call for it,
but do not stop, okay?

691
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,519
Do not stop. You want some water?

...action, Dirk.

700
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,464
Hello. Are you John?

701
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,800
Yes, ma'am.

702
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,469
Your agency recommends you very highly.

703
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:37,390
Well, l'm a really hard worker, and if
you give me a job, l won't disappoint you.

704
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:40,476
-What special skills do you have?
-Well, I just got--

705
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:44,313
I've been in the Marines for three years.
I just got back from a tour of duty.

706
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,565
-You're kidding.
-No, l'm not.

707
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:50,152
And it got really hard being surrounded
by all those guys all day.

708
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,405
How long has it been
since you've had a woman?

709
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:55,783
-A long time.
-That's terrible.

710
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:59,996
But now l'm back,
and l'm ready to pursue my acting career.

711
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:03,416
Well, as you may or may not know,
this is an important film for me.

712
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,335
lf it's not a hit,
I'm gonna get kicked out of my apartment.

713
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:09,588
-My landlord's a real jerk.
-Really?

714
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:13,592
Why don't you take your pants off?
It's important I get an idea of your size.

715
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,553
No problem.

716
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,184
Oh.

717
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:51,964
I think that you have the job,
but why don't I make sure of something?

718
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:57,470
This is a giant cock.

719
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,613
We've rolled out.

720
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:42,158
Uh, we gotta change mags.

721
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,743
Do it quickly.

722
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,127
- Kids.
-ls everything cool?

723
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:56,088
It's going great.
We just gotta change the angle.

724
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:58,090
Does it--? Does it look sexy?

725
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:01,343
-Oh, it's great.
-You're doing so good, Dirk.

726
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,762
-Does it feel good?
-Yep.

727
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,896
Okay?

728
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,439
Roll sound, Scotty.

729
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:18,861
Speed.

730
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,697
Quiet. Sticks.

731
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,620
Marker.

732
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:29,455
We're back.

733
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:31,582
Action, kids.

734
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:36,629
-We're gonna go down now.
-Okay.

735
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:41,926
-No. No, first-- Down again.
-Okay.

736
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:50,601

737
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:53,020

Oh, God, yeah.

-Cut. Terrific. Nice work. Nice work.

- Hey, the camera loves you.
- We didn't get the come shot.

756
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,346
- What?
- We missed the come shot.

757
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,140
He came inside of her.

758
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,976
Maybe we could,
like, go to stock footage or--

759
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:17,813
Are you crazy? It won't match.

760
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,023
-Well--
Jack.

761
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:22,985
- Hmm?
-l could do it again if you need a close-up.

762
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,659
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

763
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,287
Okay, everyone say, "Dirk."

764
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,788
Dirk.

765
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,583
These are real wood.

766
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:40,711
No, these. These are the ones.
These are great.

767
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,921
Yeah. Those are really cool.
Are they lizard?

768
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:46,091
No. They're ltalian.
I'm gonna fucking buy these.

769
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:49,970
Guys.

770
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:54,141
It's funny you say that
because we should be in a band, you know?

771
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,610
- Like my shoes?
- They're cool.

772
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,196
I got them with Reed and Scotty.
They're cool, huh?

773
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,656
- Yeah.
- You know, embossed leather...

774
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:13,285
...with this patchwork,
reptilian-pattern design.

775
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,412
-Cool.
-Can we have some hot sauce here?

776
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,331
-Oh, hi, Scotty.
-Hi, Scotty.

777
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:20,250
-Come on, sit down and help yourself.
- Oh, thanks.

778
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:21,502
Say hello to Jaime Lynn.

779
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:24,296
-Scotty, this is Jaime Lynn.
-l was thinking about the--

780
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,382
Scotty, Jaime Lynn.
Say hello to Jaime Lynn.

781
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,467
- You're a Leo, huh?
- That's right.

782
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,136
-Hey, my girlfriend wants to meet you.
-ls that right?

783
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:33,847
-This is Raymond.
-How do you do? What's your name?

784
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:35,974
-Becky Barnett.
-Excuse me?

785
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:38,018
Becky Barnett.

786
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:40,771
-Raymond's a Leo.
-l knew it. I knew it.

787
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,648
- What's your sign?
-l'm a Pisces.

788
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,983
What? l can't deal with no Pisces.

789
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:47,111
-That shirt's pretty sexy too.
-Well, yeah.

790
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:50,030
Well, this is, um, like,
imported Italian nylon...

791
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:53,283
...and, uh, it's like a special-edition,
limited silk print...

792
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:57,746
...and it was done by this really famous,
um, design artist from ltaly.

793
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:58,956
Pick a card, man.

794
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:01,375
What's up, baby? l love you.
Picture later, baby.

795
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:04,920
What table's that going to?
Four? Five, Jose. Five.

796
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:09,007
What's happening, my man?
You alive, man. l thought you were dead.

797
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:12,678
-Yo, what's up, people?
- Rise from the deck.

798
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,263
Oh.

799
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,265
-Damn, that's--
-Two of diamonds, right?

800
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,475
-That's my card. That is incredible.
-Right.

801
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:22,688
But doesn't it make you nervous when
you're dealing with all those evil forces?

802
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,398
Horses? What?

803
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:26,984
No. The evil forces.

804
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:30,696
Evil? No, man. It's not evil.
It's an illusion.

805
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:33,532
-lt's an illusion.
-Yeah. Yeah, it's confusing.

806
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,409
Thank you.

807
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,369
Listen up, kid. Listen up.

808
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:40,622
I'm gonna try and do this all in one shot,
know what l mean?

809
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:43,625
So we start like this,
and then you roll her over, Dirk.

810
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:45,794
Rollergirl, you roll right over with him.

811
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:48,505
Try to give me every single position.
Is that possible?

812
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:51,216
Well, if she--
Rollergirl, if you wrap your leg around--

813
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,051
No, the other one, the left one.

814
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:56,847
Around and over. Good.
See, we can go right into doggy style.

815
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:58,557
Perfect.

816
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,477
Is the movement on a waterbed
gonna be a problem?

817
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,979
No, not at all, Kurt.
I mean, l dig it. lt's great.

818
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,522
-Okay, can we do this?
-Yeah.

819
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,983
All right, everybody, here we go.

820
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,736
-This is gonna be great. Jack.
- Yeah?

821
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,738
Do you want me
to use a Spanish accent?

822
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:24,500
"Jack Horner has found something special
in newcomer Dirk Diggler.

823
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:28,587
It's another stellar sexual standout
from Horner and Company.

824
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:32,299
Diggler delivers a performance
worth a thousand hard-ons.

825
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:35,636
His presence when dressed is powerful
and demanding.

826
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:37,721
When stripped to the bone...

827
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:40,766
...Diggler's more eruptive than a volcano
on a bad day.

828
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:43,477
Amber Waves' ripe cherry lips
do a wonderful job...

829
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,562
...of handling Diggler's wide load.

830
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,940
And Reed Rothchild's stiff biceps...

831
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:52,945
...do a slapping good job
with Becky Barnett's supple ass.

832
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:55,781
But it's Diggler that
remains the standout in this film.

833
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,283
lt's easy to predict
that after only two films...

834
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:01,495
...that Diggler's success
can only grow and grow and grow...

835
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:04,122
...and grow and grow and grow...

836
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:08,627
...and grow and grow and grow."

837
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:16,194
-What else?
-Well, that's it for now.

838
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:19,865
I mean, look at the character
Holmes came up with, for instance.

839
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:23,619
-And look, l just....
-Tell me.

840
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:27,664
I don't like seeing women treated that way.
This guy he plays, Johnny Wadd--

841
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:32,044
It's always about slapping some girl around
or whatever. lt's not right. It's not cool.

842
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:35,297
It's just not sexy. l mean,
it's not sexy like it should be, Jack.

843
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:38,342
This guy's more of like
a James Bond-type character.

844
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:42,137
You know, he's classy.
He's a world-traveled guy.

845
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:46,391
-l like that.
- Reed could play my partner.

846
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:50,896
-l like that a lot.
-We could make it really good, Jack.

847
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:54,608
Honestly, if you direct it,
we make a whole series with a whole story.

848
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:57,194
I mean, it's exactly
what we've always talked about.

849
01:00:58,279 --> 01:00:59,905
Please?

850
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:03,367
When we get back, set up the typewriter.

851
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,328
We'll see what comes out of it.

852
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:09,748
But l have to talk to the Colonel
when we get to Vegas.

853
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:12,918
And, Dirk, you gotta
work on the Colonel too, Dirk.

854
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,544
I mean, you gotta be committed.

855
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:17,881
Right, right. Jack,
I'll do whatever l have to do.

856
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,509
Does this character have a name?

857
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,430
His name is Brock Landers.

858
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:27,891
His partner's name is Chest Rockwell.

859
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,437
Those are great names.

860
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:36,775
And the award for best newcomer
goes to....

861
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:40,612
Yes. My baby boy. Dirk Diggler.
Whoo.

862
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:43,073
And the award for best cock goes to....

863
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,991
Here we go again. Dirk Diggler.

864
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:48,203
The award for best actor goes to.... Aah!

865
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:51,206
I've seen all his movies,
and l can't wait to work with him.

866
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,709
Mr. Dirk Diggler.

867
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,748
Wow.

868
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:35,417
-l don't know what to say.
- Come on, say it.

869
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:36,668
I guess--

870
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:37,961
Wow.

871
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:40,172
I guess the only thing l can say...

872
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:43,508
...is l'll promise to keep rocking 'n' rolling
and making better films.

873
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:49,723
You know, it seems we make
these movies and sometimes, you know...

874
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:52,601
...they're considered filthy or something
by some people...

875
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,895
...but l don't think that's true.

876
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:57,898
These movies we make,
they can be better.

877
01:02:58,065 --> 01:03:00,984
They can help. They really can.
I mean that.

878
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:03,320
We can always do better.

879
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:05,864
I'm gonna keep trying
if you guys keep trying.

880
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:07,741
Let's keep rocking 'n' rolling, man.

881
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:21,171
Yeah!

882
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,176
Marker.

883
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:28,345
Set.

884
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:48,573
Shot of tequila, straight up.

885
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:50,575
Yes, ma'am.

886
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:55,956
I've been in this place for 20 minutes
just to get a seat.

887
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:59,918
-Are you alone?
-Yeah. Just visiting L.A.

888
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:03,129
Some people told me
the food in here was really good.

889
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:05,257
Good? lt's not good.

890
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:09,427
lt's probably the best place to eat
in all of Los Angeles. lt's excellent.

891
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:11,263
l certainly hope so.

892
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:14,599
l could die of starvation
before I get something in my mouth.

893
01:04:16,727 --> 01:04:18,728
Still hungry?

894
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,523
Starving.

895
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:28,029
-Why don't you feast on that?
- Okay.

896
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:40,208
Oh, it's true.

897
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:41,918
What's that?

898
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:45,130
You are Brock Landers.

899
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:12,282
Freeze! Don't make me chase you, Raphael!

900
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:25,545
Freeze!

901
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:43,855
We're almost there. Here's what l want.
I want you to trim the head.

902
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:47,192
Take that shot of Reed with the revolver,
just dump that, okay?

903
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,735
And switch the title card.

904
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:52,238
I want it to come flying right out
of the screen, right at the audience.

905
01:05:52,406 --> 01:05:55,075
-Nice. Piece of cake.
-That's my guy.

906
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:00,372
l told him,
"This is a special party for Scotty J.

907
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:02,999
I want your lightest,
bubbliest champagne."

908
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:04,417
So this is what he gave me.

909
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:07,170
I want you take a little sip
and tell me what you think.

910
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:10,590
This is supposed to be really good stuff.
Here. Take a sip.

911
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,510
-ls that pretty light?
-Yeah, that is.

912
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:15,804
-Baby, it's beautiful.
-What do you think?

913
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,055
-lt's great?
-Yeah.

914
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,724
-Look how spacious it is.
-Yeah. Look, l like this too.

915
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:22,560
That's custom-made.
That's real imported ltalian leather.

916
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:25,105
-This color is very unusual.
-Watch this.

917
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:27,273
- What's that?
- My initials.

918
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:29,776
Oh, that's so imaginative.
How'd you think of that?

919
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:32,529
I was just thinking of my name one day
and dreamt it up.

920
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:33,738
-Hi, Dirk.
-How are you?

921
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:35,532
-l'm almost finished.
- Looks great.

922
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,243
l used a little poetic license
to capture your essence.

923
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,453
- Show me the rest of the house?
-Looks great.

924
01:06:40,621 --> 01:06:42,497
Yeah, it's good for conversation, huh?

925
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:46,918
Yeah. Jessie did that oil painting as well
and Buck is still installing the stereo.

926
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:48,712
-That's a beanbag.
- You're kidding.

927
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:52,924
And that lamp, those are real sterling silver.
Yeah, they have a very modern feel too.

928
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:55,552
This could be the place
you could have conversations.

929
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,262
-You ready?
-What is this? Yeah.

930
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:58,930
- Ta-da.
- Oh.

931
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:03,601
-This is my dojo.
-lt's all Asian. You have an Asian room.

932
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:06,938
- Yeah. It has that whole karate feel.
-Nice. lt's very comfortable.

933
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,441
- Yeah. A lot of ancient China.
-That's really good.

934
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:11,568
I have my statues for my best-actor awards.

935
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:13,903
You have a place
to keep your awards. l'm glad.

936
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:15,739
Look up there.

937
01:07:15,948 --> 01:07:17,198
Oh, that's handy.

938
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:18,783
- Can you see yourself?
-Yeah.

939
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:20,452
- That's great, huh?
-That's nice.

940
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:21,619
- Ta-da.
-Oh.

941
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:23,747
- My whole entire wardrobe.
-That's great.

942
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:27,125
It's all perfectly organized by color,
as well as designer.

943
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:31,755
You don't have to think about anything.
You just reach in and know right where it is.

944
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:33,214
-You're gonna love it.
-Yeah?

945
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:36,426
This is my favorite thing
in the whole world. Close your eyes.

946
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:38,595
-Okay, you ready?
-Yeah, baby.

947
01:07:43,934 --> 01:07:46,061
-lsn't it beautiful?
-Oh, God. Heh.

948
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:49,564
This is it. This is the thing.

949
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:51,191
You deserve this, baby.

950
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:55,236
Isn't it great? This is the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen in my whole life.

951
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:57,530
-You wanna go for a ride?
-Oh, yeah. Heh.

952
01:07:58,532 --> 01:08:00,575
Let's do this thing. She rocks.

953
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,160
Whoo.

954
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:03,620
- Yeah!
- Ha, ha.

955
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:05,830
- Hold on.
- Ha, ha.

956
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:09,084
-You set us up, Chico.
-You wanna fuck with Raphael and Ringo...

957
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:12,796
...that's your business.
You don't fuck with Chest and Brock.

958
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:15,215
-No--
-You know what?

959
01:08:15,382 --> 01:08:16,883
-No.
-You're not even worth it.

960
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:19,219
l gave you a chance.

961
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:24,766
I trusted him.

962
01:08:26,977 --> 01:08:30,230
Well, we almost solved the case.

963
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:33,775
At least the women are safe.

964
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:37,195
Let's go get some of that
Saturday-night beaver.

965
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:41,324
No one fucks with Chest and Brock.

966
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:44,869
This is the best work we've ever done.

967
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:47,539
It's a real film, Jack.

968
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:52,752
-lt feels good.
-You made it fly.

969
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:57,924
You know, this is the film...

970
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:00,510
...l want them to remember me by.

971
01:09:11,438 --> 01:09:13,064
Thank you.

972
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:35,128
You know, as far as I'm concerned,
it's all about love, you know?

973
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:38,673
I mean, if you love someone,
how hard can the world be?

974
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:42,260
I mean, uh, people will come
and they will go, and so will problems...

975
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:47,682
...but ultimately, if you have got love
on your side, and it is just....

976
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:52,437
I mean,
it is just deep down in your soul...

977
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:57,400
...what's a problem gonna be
that takes your attention away from that?

978
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:00,737
Do you understand?

979
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:06,159
-l'm Becky Barnett.
-l'm Jerome.

980
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:08,828
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too, Becky.

981
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:12,749
-So, what do you do?
-Oh, uh, I'm in the auto industry.

982
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:14,000
Oh.

983
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:16,628
Yeah, l'm a regional manager
over at Pep Boys.

984
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:17,921
Oh. Wow.

985
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:19,589
That's great. That's great.

986
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:21,466
You've got a really nice smile, Becky.

987
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:24,302
Thank you, heh, heh...

988
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:26,512
-...Jerome. Ha, ha.
-Ha, ha.

989
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:42,487
-The Colonel.
-Excuse me.

990
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:47,784
Floyd Gondolli. Ha, ha.
Great you could make it. Great, great, great.

991
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:51,412
-How are you? You look happy.
-l'm fine.

992
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:53,748
-Meet boys, Tommy, Pete.
-Hi.

993
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,875
Meet girls, Cyndi, Angie.

994
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:57,252
-Hi.
-Hi.

995
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:59,671
-These are the next stars.
-Mm-hm.

996
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:03,258
-These are the real people in the world.
-Ah, ahem.

997
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:07,679
I think we ought to talk with Jack now.
Iron this out before we start the new year?

998
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:08,846
Let's do it.

999
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:12,684
What were you thinking? What
were you feeling? Did you do research?

1000
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:14,686
-Hi, Amber.
-What are you talking about?

1001
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:17,981
-Oh, nothing.
-You wanna come with me for a little while?

1002
01:11:18,148 --> 01:11:21,192
-Where?
-lt's a surprise, surprise, surprise.

1003
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,861
Yeah. Let's go. Excuse me, Jessie.

1004
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:56,436
- Hey, Buck.
-Hey, Jessie. How you doing?

1005
01:11:56,603 --> 01:11:59,564
- You sitting alone?
-Yes.

1006
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:06,070
- Todd Parker.
- Rocking Reed Rothchild.

1007
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:10,575
-Aw, you made it. Yeah. Woo-hoo.
-Yeah.

1008
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:12,994
Amazing party, man.
Fucking chicks everywhere.

1009
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,747
You bet. Courtesy of Jack Horner.
Thank you.

1010
01:12:15,914 --> 01:12:19,000
I wouldn't mind me having
a piece of that action right over there.

1011
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,877
That's Michelle. l'll introduce you.

1012
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:24,797
-Sure. lntroduce her to my lap.
-Ha, ha. Did you get off work, man?

1013
01:12:24,965 --> 01:12:27,091
-l don't dance Sunday nights.
-Right.

1014
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:30,303
-Whose Vette is that out in the driveway?
-Dirk.

1015
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:32,597
-l'm so jealous of him.
-That shit's jamming.

1016
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:35,933
It's dropped down low with a 350 cube,
3-and-a-quarter horsepower...

1017
01:12:36,101 --> 01:12:39,103
...4-speed, 4.10 gears,
10 coats of competition orange...

1018
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:41,939
...hand-rubbed lacquer
with a dual-plane manifold.

1019
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:44,233
Tsk, full fucking race cams. Whoa.

1020
01:12:44,401 --> 01:12:45,943
Yep.

1021
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,453
I'm pretty happy with it, you know.

1022
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:57,330
It's a great look for you, I think.

1023
01:12:57,498 --> 01:13:00,500
It's pretty original, you know, l think.

1024
01:13:00,667 --> 01:13:02,210
Right.

1025
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:06,672
Heh. I'm gonna take this off.

1026
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,968
-Ha, ha.
-Yeah.

1027
01:13:11,136 --> 01:13:12,970
What were we talking about before?

1028
01:13:13,138 --> 01:13:16,724
-Um, oil painting?
-No.

1029
01:13:16,975 --> 01:13:20,812
-No-- Yes. l mean, um, but l was saying--
-Oh, oh, oh. Sunsets.

1030
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:23,731
Right, yeah.
I was saying that I love sunsets.

1031
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:27,151
-But sunrises are better. Heh.
-Exactly. Ha, ha.

1032
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:29,779
I thought I was the only one
who felt that way.

1033
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:31,823
-No, I feel that way.
-Really?

1034
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:35,326
Yes, really. Hey, have you ever heard
my stereo system?

1035
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:38,704
-No.
-l'm gonna open my own business.

1036
01:13:38,872 --> 01:13:41,999
-Really?
-Yes. Yes. lt's my dream.

1037
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:47,130
Okay, it's hi-fi stereo equipment
at discount prices.

1038
01:13:47,297 --> 01:13:50,550
Yeah. lt's called
Buck's Super Stereo World.

1039
01:13:50,717 --> 01:13:53,219
-That is a fucking great idea. Heh.
-Yeah.

1040
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:57,515
You know, in the 80s,
that's when it's gonna happen for real.

1041
01:13:57,683 --> 01:14:00,351
-Really?
-Yes, really. The 1980s.

1042
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:01,561
Wow.

1043
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:06,774
I wanted you to give me a minute
so l could tell you how much l love you.

1044
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:10,528
I mean, it's gonna be a new year and
we're gonna start things and do things...

1045
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:14,198
...and l just wanted you to know
how much I care about you.

1046
01:14:14,366 --> 01:14:15,825
I really care about you, honey.

1047
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:17,869
-You're my little baby.
-Thank you, Amber.

1048
01:14:18,036 --> 01:14:22,540
You're the best thing that's happened to me
since my son went off, and I just--

1049
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:25,376
I love you, honey.

1050
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:27,587
I love you too.

1051
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:31,841
Fucking 1980, you know?

1052
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:33,468
-Can you believe it?
-l can't.

1053
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:38,431
I mean, it's like, the next thing you know
it's gonna be, like, 1990 and 2000.

1054
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:40,558
-l mean, can you imagine?
-Hmm.

1055
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:46,564
Goodbye, 1979. Hello, 1980.

1056
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:48,065
Okay.

1057
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:52,570
Make sure you snort it back real quick
and hard.

1058
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:55,490
-Huh?
-Like this.

1059
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:04,040
Okay.

1060
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:12,006
-Ugh, it burns.
-lt's good though, right?

1061
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:14,091
-lt's going in my throat.
-Hmm.

1062
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:16,969
That's the drip. The drip's the best part.

1063
01:15:17,137 --> 01:15:20,431
-lt tastes like aspirin.
-Here. Do one more in the other nostril.

1064
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:23,184
-l need a drink of water, l think.
-Mm-mm.

1065
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:26,562
One more, and then a drink of water.

1066
01:15:32,736 --> 01:15:34,862
Do you think I look cool when l do it?

1067
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:42,286
So let's talk about the future.

1068
01:15:42,454 --> 01:15:45,331
Let's talk about what video means
to this industry.

1069
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:48,000
And let's talk about how all of us--
Not one of us.

1070
01:15:48,168 --> 01:15:49,877
How all of us are gonna profit.

1071
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:54,549
I've been doing theater in San Francisco
and San Diego...

1072
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:57,051
...about as long as
you've been doing stag and hard-core.

1073
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:59,554
We're all familiar with your biography,
Floyd.

1074
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:02,265
No one is doubting your credentials
or your history.

1075
01:16:02,432 --> 01:16:04,308
Then why the resistance?

1076
01:16:04,476 --> 01:16:07,812
I mean, this industry is gonna
be turned upside down soon enough.

1077
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:11,816
-Why help it?
-Why not be prepared?

1078
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:14,527
Colonel's got the money.
You got the talent, Jack.

1079
01:16:14,695 --> 01:16:17,613
I got the connection to the equipment
and the mail-order distribution.

1080
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:22,868
Not to mention those kids out there
who are hot fuck action to the max, Jack.

1081
01:16:23,328 --> 01:16:26,747
This is the future.
Videotape tells the truth.

1082
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:32,837
Wait a minute. You come into my house,
my party, to tell me about the future?

1083
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:36,591
That the future is tape, videotape,
and not film?

1084
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:40,177
That it's amateurs and not professionals?
I'm a filmmaker.

1085
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:43,514
That's why I will never make a movie
on videotape.

1086
01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:45,349
And l'll tell you something else.

1087
01:16:45,517 --> 01:16:48,477
I will never, ever loan out
any of the actors...

1088
01:16:48,645 --> 01:16:51,522
-...that l have under contract to you.
-Wait, wait, wait, Jack.

1089
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:55,109
I'm not a complicated man. l like cinema.

1090
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:58,029
In particular,
I like to see people fucking on film.

1091
01:16:58,196 --> 01:17:01,198
I don't wanna win an Oscar,
and l don't wanna reinvent the wheel.

1092
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:05,369
I like simple pleasures like butter in my ass,
lollipops in my mouth.

1093
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:07,872
That's just me.
That's just something that I enjoy.

1094
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,707
Call me crazy, call me a pervert...

1095
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:12,960
...but there's one little thing
that I wanna do in this life...

1096
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:17,798
...and that is I wanna make
a dollar and a cent in this business.

1097
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:20,426
Ahh, Jack, l'm not trying to hurt you.

1098
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:23,554
I'm trying to help you
stay one step ahead of the game.

1099
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:27,391
We're going in circles now.
We're in familiar territory.

1100
01:17:27,851 --> 01:17:29,977
The territory we're in is the future.

1101
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:31,354
Not to mention the cost.

1102
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:35,566
You know, if it looks like shit
and it sounds like shit...

1103
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:37,276
...then it must be shit.

1104
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:42,073
You're holding on too tight, Jack.
It doesn't have to look good.

1105
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,533
Film is just too damn expensive.

1106
01:17:44,701 --> 01:17:47,703
And the theaters are already converting
to video projectors.

1107
01:17:48,413 --> 01:17:49,914
I haven't heard that.

1108
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:51,916
Well, it's true.

1109
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:56,420
Well....

1110
01:17:58,632 --> 01:18:00,383
Ten minutes before the new year.

1111
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,470
I'd like to spend it with my friends.

1112
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:08,307
We will or will not continue
this conversation.

1113
01:18:15,273 --> 01:18:17,775
-Hey, Dirk. Ha, ha.
-Hey, Scotty. What's up?

1114
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:19,777
-Fucking New Year's, right?
-1980.

1115
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:23,614
-Oh, man, right. Did you see my new car?
-You got a new car?

1116
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:24,990
-Yeah. Wanna see?
-Yeah.

1117
01:18:25,158 --> 01:18:27,243
All right, cool. lt's out front.

1118
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,245
Come on. lt's out front.

1119
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:32,498
Dirk. l want you to meet my friend Todd.
Todd Parker, Dirk Diggler.

1120
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:34,583
-What's up? How are you?
-We finally meet.

1121
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,793
-Yeah.
-No.

1122
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:38,838
I was telling you about him before.
You remember. Todd Parker.

1123
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:41,924
-He works at Party Boys Strip Club.
-Oh, cool. You're a dancer.

1124
01:18:42,092 --> 01:18:44,927
-Yeah, I got some moves.
-Dirk? Uh--

1125
01:18:45,595 --> 01:18:48,222
I'm sorry. You coming?
Or you wanna talk to these guys--?

1126
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,975
Yeah, Scotty. l'll be around in a bit.
We can talk then?

1127
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:52,435
-Okay.
-See you later, Reed.

1128
01:18:52,602 --> 01:18:54,270
-See you.
-All right.

1129
01:18:56,690 --> 01:19:00,651
Uh, when you get by, uh, the lights,
close your eyes.

1130
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:01,819
-Okay?
-All right.

1131
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:04,363
-All right, just follow my voice. All right?
-Yeah.

1132
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:08,868
Here, here, here.

1133
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:11,328
-Here, here, here.
-Where?

1134
01:19:11,496 --> 01:19:14,457
Keep coming. All right, open them.

1135
01:19:14,624 --> 01:19:16,459
This is it. Ha-ha-ha.

1136
01:19:16,626 --> 01:19:19,295
-lt's cool.
-Yeah. You wanna get inside?

1137
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:21,046
-When did you get this?
-Uh, yesterday.

1138
01:19:21,214 --> 01:19:25,009
Actually, I had it painted yesterday
so the paint might still be kind of sticky.

1139
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:28,512
-This is great, man. Really great.
-You wanna go for a ride?

1140
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:32,141
Wait, wait, wait. Fuck.
Hell, how much time is left?

1141
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:35,436
-l'm sorry, Dirk.
-What the hell is the matter with you?

1142
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:38,522
-Why did you do that, Scotty?
-Uh, you look at me sometimes.

1143
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:40,524
-What?
-l wanted to know if you like me.

1144
01:19:40,692 --> 01:19:43,652
Well, of cour-- Uh.
Yeah, l like you, Scotty.

1145
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:45,863
-Can l kiss you? Please?
-Scotty, I don't--

1146
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:47,698
-Can l kiss you on the mouth?
-No.

1147
01:19:47,866 --> 01:19:50,117
-Please let me.
-Scotty.

1148
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:53,537
I'm really sorry. l didn't mean
to grab you like that or scare you.

1149
01:19:53,705 --> 01:19:55,498
-lt's all right.
-Do you wanna kiss me?

1150
01:19:55,665 --> 01:19:57,750
-Scotty, wha--?
-No?

1151
01:19:57,918 --> 01:19:59,835
-What is the matter with you?
-Uh, forget it.

1152
01:20:00,003 --> 01:20:04,715
I'm really drunk. Really, I am. l'm just--
I'm out of my head.

1153
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:07,384
I'm so wa-- l'm really wasted. Really, Dirk.

1154
01:20:07,552 --> 01:20:10,346
-l'm really wasted. l'm crazy right now.
-l understand, man.

1155
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:13,057
-l'm really crazy, you know?
-Do you wanna go back inside?

1156
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:14,600
Uh--

1157
01:20:14,768 --> 01:20:17,186
-Do you like my car, Dirk?
-What?

1158
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:19,021
-l mean--
-Yeah. Yeah.

1159
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:21,065
Because I wanted to, you know--

1160
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:23,442
I wanted to make sure
you thought it was cool...

1161
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:26,111
...or else l was gonna take it back.

1162
01:20:26,279 --> 01:20:27,822
Oh.

1163
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:29,573
-Yeah.
-lt's great, Scotty.

1164
01:20:29,741 --> 01:20:31,367
Happy New Year.

1165
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:34,328
-Happy New Year, Scotty.
-l love you. I really love you.

1166
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:36,288
-l love you too, Scotty.
-Okay.

1167
01:20:36,456 --> 01:20:40,709
-All right, let's go back inside, okay?
-All right. All right.

1168
01:20:48,593 --> 01:20:51,011
Fucking idiot.

1169
01:20:51,429 --> 01:20:54,056
I'm a fucking idiot.

1170
01:20:56,142 --> 01:21:09,613
I'm a fucking idiot.

1171
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:14,201
Fucking idiot. Fucking idiot. Fucking idiot.

1172
01:21:14,911 --> 01:21:20,958
Jackie. Jackie.
Two minutes, pops. Let's go, let's go.

1173
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,919
Whoo!

1174
01:21:24,921 --> 01:21:28,382
Two. Two minutes. Two minutes.

1175
01:21:28,758 --> 01:21:30,301
Come on, Little Bill.

1176
01:21:30,468 --> 01:21:33,929
Okay. Becky, I'm--

1177
01:21:38,643 --> 01:21:41,812
Little Bill. Smile, man. Come here.

1178
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:44,148
Right, ha, ha.

1179
01:21:47,402 --> 01:21:49,153
I'm so excited.

1180
01:21:52,824 --> 01:21:54,700
Little Bill, champagne?

1181
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:57,286
-Aw, thanks. That's really nice of you.
-Happy New Year.

1182
01:21:57,454 --> 01:21:58,621
-To you too.
-Okay, man.

1183
01:21:58,788 --> 01:22:00,623
Get some champagne, dude.

1184
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:05,169
No, I'm sorry, l don't have any matches.

1185
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:07,713
- l got it here, hold on.
- Happy New Year.

1186
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:14,845
Hey, Kurt, have you seen my wife?

1187
01:22:15,013 --> 01:22:17,222
No, no. Hey, they're doing
that countdown thing.

1188
01:22:17,390 --> 01:22:19,475
-Come on in, man.
- Okay.

1189
01:22:59,516 --> 01:23:02,476
Come on, say something. Make a toast.

1190
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:04,770
Hey, Little Bill, look at me.

1191
01:24:06,499 --> 01:24:11,879
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...

1192
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:15,299
...four, three, two--

1193
01:24:18,511 --> 01:24:22,139
- What the fuck was that?
- Where's Jack?

1194
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:27,311
Where's Jack?

1195
01:24:33,818 --> 01:24:35,694
What about your character Brock Landers...

1196
01:24:35,862 --> 01:24:39,782
...and what some people might consider
violent attitudes towards women?

1197
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:44,453
Violence? No. What--?

1198
01:24:45,163 --> 01:24:50,709
l mean, if there's a certain amount
of, you know, violence or action...

1199
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:53,420
...in this series of films,
you know, that's the movie.

1200
01:24:56,549 --> 01:24:59,384
If Brock Landers is slick with a gun...

1201
01:24:59,552 --> 01:25:02,429
...he does so
only in the vein of good and right.

1202
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:05,390
Brock protects the values
of the American ideal...

1203
01:25:05,558 --> 01:25:10,979
...and fights for causes that instill pride in
a society where morals are hard to come by.

1204
01:25:11,147 --> 01:25:13,857
-Who sent you? Who sent you?
-Get the fuck off me, asshole.

1205
01:25:14,025 --> 01:25:16,860
Lie still! Lie still
or I'll punch you in the goddamn face!

1206
01:25:17,028 --> 01:25:19,196
Fuck off.

1207
01:25:20,406 --> 01:25:21,698
I'll find out who sent you.

1208
01:25:25,662 --> 01:25:31,208
Amber, l live in this world.
l don't like violence any more than you do.

1209
01:25:31,584 --> 01:25:33,669
Violence is a bad thing.

1210
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:38,423
But when you see violence in films, it's--
You know--

1211
01:25:38,591 --> 01:25:42,553
lf movies, films, caused violence...

1212
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:44,721
...we'd be able
to wipe out violence tomorrow.

1213
01:25:44,889 --> 01:25:46,723
Boom, no more films.
That's fine with me.

1214
01:25:46,891 --> 01:25:49,518
I'll find something else to do.
I'll fuck on my own time.

1215
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:52,229
You know, I got other interests.
I'm a magician.

1216
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:56,692
Um, and, you know, hopefully, that'll be
something that I focus on in the future.

1217
01:25:56,860 --> 01:26:00,904
Because you can't fuck forever.
l realize that. Anyway, violence...

1218
01:26:01,072 --> 01:26:04,533
...is something that plagues us
as a society.

1219
01:26:05,118 --> 01:26:08,579
Well, the fine line is
l'm playing a character.

1220
01:26:08,746 --> 01:26:10,998
You know, I mean, I'm Dirk Diggler.

1221
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,419
Brock Landers
is a character that l'm playing.

1222
01:26:16,087 --> 01:26:18,672
l'm gonna ask you once more,
and l'm gonna ask you nice.

1223
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,799
Where the fuck is Ringo, you bitch?

1224
01:26:21,217 --> 01:26:22,718
Fuck you.

1225
01:26:22,886 --> 01:26:23,927
Oh!

1226
01:26:24,095 --> 01:26:26,180
-Uh, why do l love him?
- Yeah.

1227
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:28,682
He's, uh-- He's very special.

1228
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:32,477
And, um, he can fuck hard
or he can fuck, like, really gently.

1229
01:26:32,645 --> 01:26:34,396
He's the best.

1230
01:26:34,564 --> 01:26:39,693
Uh, I think that's part of my reason
for doing this, you know?

1231
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:42,529
I've gotten thousands
upon thousands of letters...

1232
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:44,406
...you know, from people telling me:

1233
01:26:44,574 --> 01:26:48,619
"God, you've taught me this and
you've made our love life so much better."

1234
01:26:48,786 --> 01:26:51,622
And this isn't "Go out and have sex
with 10 million people."

1235
01:26:51,789 --> 01:26:55,459
And, you know, "How to get a girl off."
It's about how to get your wife off.

1236
01:26:55,627 --> 01:26:57,961
If only people
could have been doing this before...

1237
01:26:58,129 --> 01:27:00,505
...we could have saved
a million relationships.

1238
01:27:00,673 --> 01:27:02,257
You know, l've saved thousands.

1239
01:27:02,425 --> 01:27:05,260
Blocking, an idea or a movement.

1240
01:27:05,428 --> 01:27:09,973
Jack will put the final touches together
for what the camera needs for editing...

1241
01:27:10,141 --> 01:27:13,185
...but, you know, he allows me
to block my own sex scenes...

1242
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:17,231
...and, you know, gives me the freedom
to develop the character and stuff like that.

1243
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:19,900
God, ha, ha, I don't know any other,
you know, director...

1244
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:24,696
...who would let an actor,
you know, do that, heh. You know?

1245
01:27:24,864 --> 01:27:29,701
Ha-ha-ha. I don't allow him
to block his own sex scenes.

1246
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:32,329
lt is. It's jealousy.

1247
01:27:32,497 --> 01:27:37,042
lt's deceitfulness. It's vindictiveness.
It's all of that stuff, you know?

1248
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:40,295
But, I mean, God, what can you expect
when you're on top, you know?

1249
01:27:40,463 --> 01:27:43,173
It's like Napoleon.
When he was the king...

1250
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:46,093
...you know, people were constantly
trying to conquer him...

1251
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,345
...you know, in the Roman Empire.

1252
01:27:49,347 --> 01:27:51,848
So it's history repeating itself
all over again.

1253
01:27:52,016 --> 01:27:55,352
To all the critics out there,
l know they're gonna be reviewing this...

1254
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,521
...and I know
they're gonna try to knock me.

1255
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:01,191
l just want them to know-- Is it okay
if l say this into the camera, Amber?

1256
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:03,026
Okay.

1257
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:06,154
l only am who I am
because I was born that way.

1258
01:28:06,322 --> 01:28:11,034
I have a gift, and I am trying
to not be selfish about it, but to use it.

1259
01:28:11,202 --> 01:28:15,372
Okay? And if you wanna knock me for that,
it's your own problem, okay?

1260
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,916
Jealousy will get you nowhere.

1261
01:28:19,168 --> 01:28:20,419
I'm gonna keep rocking on.

1262
01:28:21,879 --> 01:28:23,380
For Dirk Diggler...

1263
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:27,384
...the future is something
to look forward to, not to fear.

1264
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:29,928
He is a creative man of many interests:

1265
01:28:30,096 --> 01:28:34,182
Film, poetry, karate, music, and dance.

1266
01:28:34,350 --> 01:28:37,227
He is a man of passion and mystery.

1267
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:39,646
He is a man of lust.

1268
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:52,409
-lt's my poem to you.
-lt's good, Amber. lt's really good.

1269
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:55,579
You're like a director now.
So have you shown Jack yet?

1270
01:28:55,747 --> 01:28:58,248
No, just you. l wanted you to be the first.

1271
01:28:58,416 --> 01:29:00,751
-lt's really good, Amber. Congratulations.
-Thanks.

1272
01:29:00,918 --> 01:29:02,836
-Thanks, baby.
-Wow.

1273
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:05,922
Um, the only thing l was wondering is--

1274
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:08,759
You might think about cutting that part
where Jack talks--

1275
01:29:08,926 --> 01:29:10,385
-About blocking the sex?
-Yeah.

1276
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:14,097
That stuff about me
not being a black belt is not true.

1277
01:29:14,265 --> 01:29:16,516
Yeah. l can fix that.

1278
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:18,560
-Ace of spades.
-How did it turn out?

1279
01:29:20,063 --> 01:29:21,897
- Are you sure?
- No.

1280
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:23,774
- Shit.
-Hello?

1281
01:29:23,941 --> 01:29:26,943
- Hey, how was it, man?
-What?

1282
01:29:27,111 --> 01:29:29,029
Really? l bet. You're so good.

1283
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:32,532
-Look, slow-- Slow down. Slow down.
- You'll have to show it to me.

1284
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:38,455
Guys, guys, guys.
Slow down, Colonel. Say again?

1285
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:44,336
I'll be right there.

1286
01:29:53,304 --> 01:29:54,638
So...?

1287
01:29:54,806 --> 01:29:57,599
Well, let me tell you, Jack, ha, ha.

1288
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:05,315
I mean, l don't mean to laugh about it,
but she was 15 going on 150, believe me.

1289
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:08,151
She was-- You would never know it.
Never know.

1290
01:30:08,319 --> 01:30:11,905
I mean, l was fooled completely.
I mean, l've had a few of them.

1291
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:13,115
Anyhow....

1292
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:16,993
You do believe me, don't you, Jack?

1293
01:30:17,161 --> 01:30:18,662
Yeah, l believe you.

1294
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:22,999
Anyway, so l take her home, Jack,
you know, and l got her there...

1295
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:25,168
...and l tell her not to do so much coke...

1296
01:30:25,336 --> 01:30:28,672
...but she must have done 20 lines
of this stuff in, like, 5 minutes.

1297
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:31,174
It's like a vacuum in her nose.
And there's only--

1298
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:33,552
Just going up like crazy.

1299
01:30:33,719 --> 01:30:37,722
Anyway, she's got all this stuff going up,
and the next thing you know, she started--

1300
01:30:37,890 --> 01:30:41,101
Something must have broken up there,
blood poured all over the place.

1301
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:44,604
All over the sheets and everything.
Just...pouring out.

1302
01:30:44,772 --> 01:30:47,649
-Oh, Jack. Oh, God.
-All right.

1303
01:30:47,817 --> 01:30:50,861
You thought she was older.
You-- You didn't do anything.

1304
01:30:51,028 --> 01:30:55,073
She was just at the-- She was at your place.
You didn't do anything, right?

1305
01:30:55,241 --> 01:30:56,783
-Nothing.
-You didn't do anything?

1306
01:30:56,951 --> 01:30:59,703
-You know me. I didn't do a thing.
-You didn't do anything?

1307
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:02,998
-No, I didn't do anything.
-All right, nothing.

1308
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:08,795
But they, uh....

1309
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:12,257
They found something at the house.

1310
01:31:14,427 --> 01:31:17,137
-What?
-There's something that's....

1311
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:23,477
Jack, it's my fucking weakness, Jack.

1312
01:31:23,644 --> 01:31:27,147
It's just, they're so small,
and they're so cute and they're so adorable.

1313
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:30,066
-l just can't help it when they're so cute--
-Jesus Christ.

1314
01:31:30,234 --> 01:31:32,777
No, no, Jack. Listen, listen.
I don't touch them, Jack.

1315
01:31:32,945 --> 01:31:37,407
I don't touch them in any way, honestly.
Jack, please.

1316
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:39,201
All right.

1317
01:31:40,995 --> 01:31:44,748
Tsk. Well, now you think I'm an asshole.

1318
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:51,087
Jack, let me tell you this.
I love you, Jack. l'm your friend.

1319
01:31:51,255 --> 01:31:54,174
There's one thing I want you to do, though.
Tell me--

1320
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:57,469
Jack, come on.
Tell me that you're my friend.

1321
01:31:57,887 --> 01:32:00,388
Just tell me. Am I your friend? Am l--?

1322
01:32:05,728 --> 01:32:06,770
Jack?

1323
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:10,148
Jack?

1324
01:32:11,108 --> 01:32:14,069
Jack, Jack, am I your friend?

1325
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:19,157
Just tell me. Am l?
Just tell me, Jack. Am l your friend?

1326
01:32:25,581 --> 01:32:27,666
-l do.
-l do too.

1327
01:32:33,172 --> 01:32:35,048
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1328
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:44,307
Listen, l'm-- l'm dying--

1329
01:32:45,059 --> 01:32:47,477
-l'm dying to do a movie with you.
- I know you are.

1330
01:32:47,645 --> 01:32:49,938
l mean,
it's such an important thing in my life.

1331
01:32:50,106 --> 01:32:52,148
I spoke to Jack--

1332
01:32:54,318 --> 01:32:56,319
Oh, man. I just--

1333
01:32:56,487 --> 01:32:58,697
-l'll tell you what comes to mind.
-Yeah?

1334
01:32:58,864 --> 01:33:02,117
What comes to mind is
I am the ultimate Latin lover.

1335
01:33:02,285 --> 01:33:05,787
-l've never been to Las Vegas.
-There is no Latin lover like me, understand?

1336
01:33:05,955 --> 01:33:07,789
Once you get Maurice as the Latin lover....

1337
01:33:07,957 --> 01:33:09,833
Have you ever been to, um, Niagara Falls?

1338
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:12,669
-l've been to Las Vegas.
-That is great. That's so great.

1339
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:16,006
This is gonna be a great opportunity for me
to run the store my way.

1340
01:33:16,173 --> 01:33:18,341
-Just to get those guys off my back.
-Exactly.

1341
01:33:18,509 --> 01:33:21,177
- Hello? Champagne.
-l'll run the store my way.

1342
01:33:21,345 --> 01:33:24,431
-You--? Are you guys moving to Bakersfield?
- Did you find a house?

1343
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:25,682
-Yeah.
-Soon?

1344
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:27,976
- l know-- l once lived in Bakersfield.
-Yeah?

1345
01:33:28,144 --> 01:33:31,146
Hey, guys, we're losing these two.
They're moving to Bakersfield.

1346
01:33:31,314 --> 01:33:34,149
-Did you like it there?
- Big promotion.

1347
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:36,860
They look at the movies and say,
"Hell, l can do that."

1348
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:39,571
- l can do it.
- It's more complicated than that.

1349
01:33:39,739 --> 01:33:41,615
-lt's a tough racket, actually.
-Right.

1350
01:33:41,782 --> 01:33:43,992
Hey, Dirk, you made it.

1351
01:33:44,368 --> 01:33:46,369
-Hey, Jack.

1352
01:33:46,537 --> 01:33:48,955
Good. Who's that?

1353
01:33:49,123 --> 01:33:51,374
Hi. l'm Johnny Doe.

1354
01:33:51,542 --> 01:33:53,918
You're Dirk Diggler.

1355
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:58,173
It's great to meet you.

1356
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:02,927
Johnny's, uh, the new boy on the street.

1357
01:34:03,095 --> 01:34:06,056
He's interested in, uh, show business.

1358
01:34:12,063 --> 01:34:13,772
He's very tired.

1359
01:34:13,939 --> 01:34:17,984
And, uh, he's shy, you know?

1360
01:34:19,362 --> 01:34:22,947
So like l said, it's a tough--
It's a tough business.

1361
01:34:23,115 --> 01:34:24,616
You got a great kisser...

1362
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:30,413
...but, you know, there's a lot of work
involved, a lot of people.

1363
01:34:30,581 --> 01:34:33,041
We all have to work our buns off.
Know what l mean?

1364
01:34:33,209 --> 01:34:38,421
I mean, it takes 15, 16 guys
just to do the lighting.

1365
01:34:40,007 --> 01:34:42,550
No, no, no. It's crystal, man.
You just wanna do bumps.

1366
01:34:42,718 --> 01:34:46,471
- Shut up, man.
-All right.

1367
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:48,682
Hey, you guys.

1368
01:34:49,141 --> 01:34:50,642
What?

1369
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:53,728
-Just saying hey.
-Yeah, whatever.

1370
01:34:54,605 --> 01:34:56,439
Oh, man.

1371
01:34:57,441 --> 01:34:59,317
-Oh!
-You all right?

1372
01:34:59,485 --> 01:35:03,321
-lt's fucking getting me fucking high, man.
-Yeah. It's that carpet dope.

1373
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:07,033
lt's the kind of dope
they used to put carpet in.

1374
01:35:07,201 --> 01:35:10,787
You know, they'd mix it up in the bathtub
and while they were mixing it up...

1375
01:35:10,955 --> 01:35:13,957
...they'd drop in a hunk of carpet into it.

1376
01:35:15,292 --> 01:35:16,626
Ow!

1377
01:35:16,794 --> 01:35:20,505
It's a lot better than that pink shit,
I tell you. The pink shit's fucking weird.

1378
01:35:20,673 --> 01:35:22,757
They put fish scales in that shit.

1379
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:35,812
Fuck.

1380
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:47,657
You look good. You ready?

1381
01:35:47,825 --> 01:35:49,659
You ready?

1382
01:35:56,917 --> 01:35:58,835
Come on.

1383
01:36:01,505 --> 01:36:04,507
I am a star.
I'm a fucking rock 'n' roll star, man.

1384
01:36:04,675 --> 01:36:06,843
My cock can get hard. Come on. Fuck.

1385
01:36:07,011 --> 01:36:10,472
Please don't do this to me.
No, please. Come on.

1386
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:13,516
I'm a star. I am--

1387
01:36:19,023 --> 01:36:21,566
Again. You ready?

1388
01:36:23,068 --> 01:36:24,986
I'm born ready.

1389
01:36:25,571 --> 01:36:27,197
Come on.

1390
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:31,743
- What?
- lt's just there's a thing there--

1391
01:36:31,911 --> 01:36:33,369
- No.
- That'll work.

1392
01:36:33,537 --> 01:36:34,954
-Jack.
- Yeah?

1393
01:36:35,122 --> 01:36:36,873
I'm ready to shoot.

1394
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:40,919
-Uh, 20 minutes, huh?
-No. I'm ready now. lt's gotta be now.

Twenty minutes, babe.

01:36:42,421 --> 01:36:46,257
Fuck it. Hey, no. Hey, Jack.
I'm ready to shoot now.

1397
01:36:46,425 --> 01:36:49,010
My cock is ready. I wanna fuck. Let's go.

1398
01:36:49,178 --> 01:36:50,637
Twenty minutes.

1399
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:53,389
-l wanna fuck. Who's it gonna be?
-What?

1400
01:36:53,557 --> 01:36:55,850
Who do you want to start fucking?
Me or him?

1401
01:36:56,018 --> 01:36:57,060
-What?
- Shut up, okay?

1402
01:36:57,228 --> 01:37:00,146
-l didn't do anything to you.
-What? You're not even an actor.

1403
01:37:00,314 --> 01:37:02,941
-You got no business being here.
- Knock this shit off.

1404
01:37:03,108 --> 01:37:04,234
-Yes, I am.
-No, no.

1405
01:37:04,401 --> 01:37:07,070
-l'm an actor. l'm a real fucking actor.
-Shut up.

1406
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:08,404
-What?
- Hey, come on.

1407
01:37:08,572 --> 01:37:09,823
- Shut up.
- No.

1408
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:12,700
Stop this Mickey Mouse bullshit.
I want you to go in there.

1409
01:37:12,868 --> 01:37:16,079
I want you to cool off, okay?

1410
01:37:16,247 --> 01:37:18,957
Just cool off and we'll come back
and shoot the scene.

1411
01:37:19,124 --> 01:37:21,501
-l said, l'm ready to shoot.
-Not now.

1412
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:24,128
I'm not gonna tell you again, Jack.

1413
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:26,673
I'm not gonna shoot you
in the state you're in.

1414
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:29,342
What do you mean, "state"?
State? State of California?

1415
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:32,595
-l know where the fuck I am, Jack.
-You've been up for two days.

1416
01:37:32,763 --> 01:37:34,430
No, I haven't been up for two days.

1417
01:37:34,598 --> 01:37:37,100
Nevertheless,
you look like you haven't been to sleep.

1418
01:37:37,268 --> 01:37:40,603
So l ain't gonna shoot you this way
because you don't look good.

1419
01:37:40,771 --> 01:37:42,981
You know what?
You don't tell me anything, okay?

1420
01:37:43,148 --> 01:37:44,983
-Really?
-You're not the boss of me.

1421
01:37:45,150 --> 01:37:46,609
-Yes, I am.
-Oh, you're the king, huh?

1422
01:37:46,777 --> 01:37:48,570
-Yes!

-Dirk, honey--

You're not the mother of me
and you're not my boss.

1425
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:55,952
-You're not my fucking mom.
-Hey, man--

1426

1428
01:38:02,042 --> 01:38:03,543
I want you out of here.

1429
01:38:03,711 --> 01:38:07,589
-Look, it's over, okay? l'm done.
-Listen to me, kid. l want you--

1430
01:38:07,756 --> 01:38:09,591
-Don't you fucking call me a kid.

1431
01:38:09,758 --> 01:38:13,386
I'll fuck you up. You wanna see me

01:38:38,203 --> 01:38:40,330
You're not my boss!
You're not the king of me!

1441
01:38:40,497 --> 01:38:42,373
I am the fucking king of Dirk!

1442
01:38:42,541 --> 01:38:45,627
You're nothing without me, Jack.
You're fucking nothing. Fuck this.

I'm gonna straighten him out.

1446
01:39:07,733 --> 01:39:09,317
Okay, Dirk, you ready?

1447
01:39:09,485 --> 01:39:11,486
Yeah. l was born ready, Nick.
Let's go, man.

1448
01:39:12,321 --> 01:39:14,155
-Dirk Diggler demo.
- Keep the vocals up.

1449
01:39:14,323 --> 01:39:17,033
"You Got the Touch," take seven.

1450
01:39:17,868 --> 01:39:19,369
Excuse me, Reed.

1451
01:39:19,536 --> 01:39:22,038
Oh, heh. Oops.

1452
01:39:25,501 --> 01:39:27,794
You got the touch

1453
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:32,674
You got the power

1454
01:39:35,636 --> 01:39:36,928
Yeah

1455
01:39:43,477 --> 01:39:46,896
After all is said and done

1456
01:39:47,064 --> 01:39:50,108
You never walk, you never run

1457
01:39:50,275 --> 01:39:52,318
You're a winner

1458
01:39:54,571 --> 01:39:58,282
You got the moves, you know the streets

1459
01:39:58,450 --> 01:40:01,369
Break the rules, take the heat

1460
01:40:01,537 --> 01:40:04,247
You're nobody's fool

1461
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,293
You're at your best
When the goin' gets rough

1462
01:40:09,461 --> 01:40:13,923
You've been put to the test
But it's never enough

1463
01:40:14,508 --> 01:40:16,259
You got the touch

1464
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:20,096
You think the bass
is taking away from the vocal?

1465
01:40:22,349 --> 01:40:26,436
No, not really. Maybe.
It sounds balanced to me.

1466
01:40:26,603 --> 01:40:28,604
It's definitely taking away from my vocal.

1467
01:40:28,772 --> 01:40:31,441
Just take the bass down
and bring up the vocals.

1468
01:40:31,608 --> 01:40:34,235
Okay, let's do it, Nick. You heard him.

1469
01:40:34,945 --> 01:40:36,446
You wanna take it from the top?

1470
01:40:36,613 --> 01:40:39,115
-Yeah, let's try it.
-Okay.

1471
01:40:39,908 --> 01:40:44,412
Heat will rock you

1472
01:40:44,830 --> 01:40:49,709
And heat will roll you

1473
01:40:50,502 --> 01:40:55,131
Baby, don't you know?

1474
01:40:55,632 --> 01:41:00,511
My heat will move your soul

1475
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:02,680
Come on, come on, come on

1476
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:04,182
Come on

1477
01:41:04,683 --> 01:41:08,728
Love me today

1478
01:41:09,980 --> 01:41:14,317
Love me tomorrow

1479
01:41:15,319 --> 01:41:18,237
All day, all night

1480
01:41:18,405 --> 01:41:21,491
You feel my heat

1481
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:26,412
Feel, feel, feel, feel my heat

1482
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:28,289
I think we should repeat that again.

1483
01:41:28,457 --> 01:41:32,835
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel

1484
01:41:33,003 --> 01:41:35,713
Feel my heat

1485
01:41:35,881 --> 01:41:38,674
Yeah. That's definitely cool.

1486
01:41:39,134 --> 01:41:41,803
-Let's lay it down. Nick?
-You wanna lay it down?

1487
01:41:41,970 --> 01:41:43,554
Were we rolling on that rehearsal?

1488
01:41:43,722 --> 01:41:46,516
Is he gonna fuck me in the ass?

1489
01:41:46,683 --> 01:41:49,685
-ls that what you want?
- lt would be nice.

1490
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:52,063
Fuck her in the ass.

1491
01:41:52,856 --> 01:41:54,398
Lock and load, Jack.

1492
01:42:02,116 --> 01:42:04,575
I was gonna take a pottery class
at Everywoman's Village.

1493
01:42:04,743 --> 01:42:07,036
-Oh, I wanna do that.
-Okay, we'll do that.

1494
01:42:07,204 --> 01:42:09,163
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at 3.

1495
01:42:09,331 --> 01:42:11,791
-l was thinking something.
-What?

1496
01:42:12,334 --> 01:42:14,919
I was gonna see about taking the GED.
Do you know what that is?

1497
01:42:15,087 --> 01:42:18,589
-Mm-hm, for high school, to graduate.
-lt's because I never got my diploma.

1498
01:42:18,757 --> 01:42:22,009
I feel bad, you know, that, uh--
I think you were right about that.

1499
01:42:22,177 --> 01:42:25,138
You should do it, Rollergirl,
because you know what?

1500
01:42:25,305 --> 01:42:28,015
If you wanted to, you could do anything.

1501
01:42:33,939 --> 01:42:36,065
- Mr. Swope.
-Yes. That's me. yes.

1502
01:42:36,233 --> 01:42:38,526
-You have your loan application?
-Yes, I do. Right there.

1503
01:42:38,694 --> 01:42:40,778
-Good. You wanna follow me?
-Yes, I do.

1504
01:42:41,238 --> 01:42:44,407
Hey, Kurt, are we gonna
have any more coverage on this, or...?

1505
01:42:44,575 --> 01:42:46,826
No, no. We just keep shooting.
This is video.

1506
01:42:46,994 --> 01:42:49,495
We shoot and shoot,
and then we deal with it later.

1507
01:42:49,663 --> 01:42:52,415
All right, now, Summer,
I want you to take Skye's thong off.

1508
01:42:52,583 --> 01:42:55,960
That thong thing. Yeah, actually take it off.
That's good. And finger it.

1509
01:42:56,128 --> 01:42:57,920
Oh, that's good. Lick the thong. Yeah.

1510
01:42:58,088 --> 01:43:00,506
You know,
that's really good technically, but--

1511
01:43:00,674 --> 01:43:03,509
But it lacks passion.
I wanna see some passion here.

1512
01:43:03,677 --> 01:43:05,094
Yes, bitch!

1513
01:43:06,722 --> 01:43:08,598
Yeah, that's it.

1514
01:43:09,183 --> 01:43:10,474
Lick my balls.

1515
01:43:11,226 --> 01:43:12,310
Fuck me.

1516
01:43:14,354 --> 01:43:15,688
Who's your daddy, bitch?

1517
01:43:16,732 --> 01:43:20,401
You live. You live. Yes!

1518
01:43:22,696 --> 01:43:24,405
I'm back.

1519
01:43:24,823 --> 01:43:25,865
Perfect timing.

1520
01:43:27,618 --> 01:43:28,659
I'm back.

1521
01:43:30,787 --> 01:43:32,914
-What the fuck took you so long, man?
-Todd.

1522
01:43:43,467 --> 01:43:44,508
Fuck.

1523
01:43:44,676 --> 01:43:48,554
That's really what Buck's Super Stereo
World is all about. lt's about the customer.

1524
01:43:48,722 --> 01:43:51,307
People wanna know
what they're getting into technically.

1525
01:43:51,475 --> 01:43:53,809
I have the specific
technical hi-fi background...

1526
01:43:53,977 --> 01:43:56,187
...to answer any question
somebody's gonna have.

1527
01:43:56,355 --> 01:43:58,689
I've been in sound equipment
long enough to know...

1528
01:43:58,857 --> 01:44:01,317
...what a guy wants
when he walks through that door.

1529
01:44:01,485 --> 01:44:05,029
That's the kind of personal touch
Buck's Super Stereo World's gonna have.

1530
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:14,830
I miss my two sons, you know.
I miss my little Andrew and-- And my Dirk.

1531
01:44:14,998 --> 01:44:18,626
You know,
I always felt like Dirk was my baby.

1532
01:44:18,794 --> 01:44:20,086
My new baby.

1533
01:44:20,504 --> 01:44:23,798
-Don't you miss Dirk?
-Yeah.

1534
01:44:23,966 --> 01:44:27,593
He's so fucking talented, the bastard.
You know, I just--

1535
01:44:29,638 --> 01:44:34,225
I love him, Rollergirl.
I mean, l really love the stupid jerk, ha, ha.

1536
01:44:35,936 --> 01:44:37,979
I love you, Mom.

1537
01:44:38,188 --> 01:44:41,065
I want you to be my mom, Amber.
Are you my mom?

1538
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:44,652
I'll just--
I'll ask you if you're my mom, okay?

1539
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:47,697
And you say yes, okay?
Are you my mom?

1540
01:44:48,323 --> 01:44:49,573
Yes, honey.

1541
01:44:49,741 --> 01:44:53,077
-Ha.
-Yes. Yes.

1542
01:44:54,663 --> 01:44:57,373
Don't try--
-Hold on. Come on, come on, all right?

1543
01:44:57,541 --> 01:44:59,750
All we need is the tapes, Burt.

1544
01:44:59,918 --> 01:45:02,295
No. You don't get them until you pay.

1545
01:45:02,462 --> 01:45:04,964
In our situation,
that doesn't make any fucking sense!

1546
01:45:05,132 --> 01:45:07,508
Wait. We can't pay
the price of the demo tapes...

1547
01:45:07,676 --> 01:45:11,137
...unless we take the demo tapes
to the record company and get paid!

1548
01:45:11,305 --> 01:45:13,347
Hello? Exactly.

1549
01:45:13,724 --> 01:45:17,560
That's not an MP.
That's a YP. "Your problem."

1550
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:20,563
Come up with the money
and l'll give you the tapes. That's it.

1551
01:45:20,731 --> 01:45:24,191
Okay, now you're talking above my head.
I don't know this industry jargon.

1552
01:45:24,359 --> 01:45:25,735
YP, MP. Whatever, okay?

1553
01:45:25,902 --> 01:45:28,487
All I know is that
I cannot get a record contract--

1554
01:45:28,655 --> 01:45:31,866
We cannot get a record contract
unless l take these tapes--

1555
01:45:32,034 --> 01:45:34,035
And granted,
the tapes themselves are your--

1556
01:45:34,202 --> 01:45:37,079
Are your busi-- Are your--
You own them, okay?

1557
01:45:37,247 --> 01:45:40,916
But the magic that is on the tapes,
that fucking heart and soul...

1558
01:45:41,084 --> 01:45:44,378
...that we put into those tapes,
that is ours, and you don't own that.

1559
01:45:44,546 --> 01:45:47,923
Now, l need to take that magic
and get it to the record company.

1560
01:45:48,091 --> 01:45:50,968
They're waiting. We were supposed
to be there a half-hour ago.

1561
01:45:51,136 --> 01:45:54,263
We look like assholes right now, man.

1562
01:46:00,729 --> 01:46:04,565
I don't wanna do this anymore, honey.
I can't. l just-- Let's have fun now.

1563
01:46:04,733 --> 01:46:08,319
Let's just go and go and go,
because it's over.

1564
01:46:08,487 --> 01:46:12,281
There's too many things. Too many things.
Too many things. Too many things.

1565
01:46:12,449 --> 01:46:15,117
-Okay.
-Let's go walk.

1566
01:46:15,285 --> 01:46:18,412
-l don't wanna leave this room.
-Me either, ha, ha.

1567
01:46:19,247 --> 01:46:20,664
I love you, honey.

1568
01:46:20,832 --> 01:46:22,625
-l love you, Mom.
-Aah!

1569
01:46:22,793 --> 01:46:26,962
Let me explain to him in simple arithmetic.
One, two, three.

1570
01:46:27,130 --> 01:46:31,133
Because you don't fucking get it, Burt.
You give us the tapes.

1571
01:46:31,301 --> 01:46:34,762
We get the record contract. We come back
and give you your fucking money.

1572
01:46:34,930 --> 01:46:37,014
Have you heard the tapes?
Have you heard them?

1573
01:46:37,182 --> 01:46:39,725
We're guaranteed a record deal.
Our stuff is that good!

1574
01:46:39,893 --> 01:46:42,853
Okay, now l got it. l got it.
Now I understand.

1575
01:46:43,021 --> 01:46:46,482
I know you want it to happen,
but it's not gonna happen...

1576
01:46:46,650 --> 01:46:49,735
...because it's a Catch-22, and that's it.

1577
01:46:49,903 --> 01:46:52,446
What the fuck does that mean?
What is a Catch-22, Burt?

1578
01:46:52,614 --> 01:46:55,449
-Aah.
-Twenty-two, gentlemen. Think about it.

1579
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:59,203
-You know what l'm thinking about, man?
-No, Dirk!

1580
01:46:59,371 --> 01:47:01,956
I'm thinking about
kicking some fucking ass in here!

1581
01:47:02,124 --> 01:47:03,541
Scotty, get him out of here.

1582
01:47:03,708 --> 01:47:07,336
Thanks a lot for backing us up too.
Real good.

1583
01:47:08,505 --> 01:47:09,713
Fuck.

1584
01:47:14,219 --> 01:47:16,595
-Mr. Swope.
- Yes.

1585
01:47:17,848 --> 01:47:19,473
We can't help you.

1586
01:47:22,185 --> 01:47:26,147
I have all the papers, though.
I mean, every-- Everything's in order, yes?

1587
01:47:26,314 --> 01:47:30,401
Yes, yes, but we can't give you a loan.
I'm sorry.

1588
01:47:30,569 --> 01:47:31,986
-Why?
-l don't understand. Why?

1589
01:47:32,154 --> 01:47:33,863
Yeah, why can't you give me the loan?

1590
01:47:35,991 --> 01:47:37,867
Mr. Swope, you're a pornographer.

1591
01:47:38,034 --> 01:47:40,494
This bank is not in business
to support pornography.

1592
01:47:40,662 --> 01:47:43,414
Okay, l'm not a pornographer, though.
I'm an actor.

1593
01:47:43,582 --> 01:47:45,249
-l'm sorry.
-Please, please.

1594
01:47:45,417 --> 01:47:48,836
Now, this is a new business for me.

1595
01:47:49,004 --> 01:47:55,009
All right? lt's a real thing that l wanna do.
It's a real thing that I can do. Please.

1596
01:47:55,552 --> 01:47:57,470
-l'm sorry.
-Well, we did everything right.

1597
01:47:57,637 --> 01:47:59,972
Okay, honey, it's okay.
Just wait a minute, wait a minute.

1598
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:03,017
Now, let's just take a minute, okay?
Um....

1599
01:48:03,727 --> 01:48:06,854
Look, you have something to say.
I have something to say, all right?

1600
01:48:07,022 --> 01:48:09,231
So let's just talk, okay?

1601
01:48:09,399 --> 01:48:12,568
If there is something
that I didn't fill out correctly on this...

1602
01:48:12,736 --> 01:48:16,489
...or if there is something l left out,
or maybe you want me to write on there...

1603
01:48:16,656 --> 01:48:19,617
...just tell me what to write on there.
I'll write it on there.

1604
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:21,702
I'm sorry.

1605
01:48:24,414 --> 01:48:27,458
You're not being fair. This isn't fair.

1606
01:48:27,626 --> 01:48:30,878
This financial institution
cannot endorse pornography.

1607
01:48:31,046 --> 01:48:33,464
Stop saying that!
Will you quit saying "pornography"?

1608
01:48:33,632 --> 01:48:37,718
-Why are you doing this to me?
-Please. Now, please. I'm sorry.

1609
01:48:40,096 --> 01:48:43,891
I'm an-- l am an ac-- I am an actor.

1610
01:48:48,146 --> 01:48:49,438
Come on.

1611
01:49:15,966 --> 01:49:18,801
-That guy wants that thing for the thing--
You fix it up.

1612
01:49:32,649 --> 01:49:34,483
Who's your daddy?

1613
01:49:34,651 --> 01:49:37,528
-How is it?
-What it is, what it is.

1614
01:49:37,696 --> 01:49:39,321
Yeah.

1615
01:49:41,366 --> 01:49:43,867
Suck that cock, bitch.

1616
01:49:57,924 --> 01:50:00,467
- Hello. You must be Maggie.
-Yes.

1617
01:50:00,635 --> 01:50:03,887
-Kathleen O'Malley. l'm the judge.
-Yes.

1618
01:50:06,182 --> 01:50:09,018
-You have a lawyer with you?
-No, I don't.

1619
01:50:09,185 --> 01:50:11,020
I do not.

1620
01:50:27,871 --> 01:50:30,873
-Hello, judge.
-Morning, counselor.

1621
01:50:51,811 --> 01:50:53,520
You've been divorced for six years?

1622
01:50:53,688 --> 01:50:56,315
Yes, since 1977.

1623
01:50:56,483 --> 01:51:00,027
And the agreement on the money settlement
has been taken care of?

1624
01:51:00,945 --> 01:51:02,571
Yes.

1625
01:51:02,989 --> 01:51:07,868
So, what we're talking about then is coming
to an agreement on the custody of....

1626
01:51:08,036 --> 01:51:09,995
-Of "Andrew."
-Yes.

1627
01:51:11,748 --> 01:51:14,249
Oh, what was decided during the divorce?

1628
01:51:14,417 --> 01:51:17,961
Well, initially, uh,
Andrew was to go with his father...

1629
01:51:18,129 --> 01:51:20,464
...with a visitation with his mother...

1630
01:51:20,632 --> 01:51:25,636
...uh, from, uh,
Saturday noon to Sunday at 7...

1631
01:51:25,804 --> 01:51:31,266
...with his mother entitled to bring Andrew
to her house or any reasonable place.

1632
01:51:31,434 --> 01:51:34,228
-Was that the understanding?
-Yes.

1633
01:51:34,729 --> 01:51:37,147
Why wasn't that visiting privilege
honored, then?

1634
01:51:37,315 --> 01:51:40,734
- It was for a while.
-l only saw him twice.

1635
01:51:40,902 --> 01:51:43,904
It said "reasonable place."

1636
01:51:44,072 --> 01:51:48,450
I didn't think that a house of prostitution
and drugs and pornography was that.

1637
01:51:48,618 --> 01:51:50,160
I'm sorry?

1638
01:51:50,328 --> 01:51:53,664
My wife is in the pornography business.

1639
01:51:54,457 --> 01:51:56,750
I didn't think that environment
was safe for my son.

1640
01:51:56,918 --> 01:52:01,463
No, this is not right.
Um, my son was never exposed to drugs...

1641
01:52:01,631 --> 01:52:03,841
...or pornographic material
or any of those things.

1642
01:52:04,008 --> 01:52:05,759
My husband just assumed--

1643
01:52:05,927 --> 01:52:09,263
I saw it with my own eye, Maggie.

1644
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:11,890
Did you register a complaint?

1645
01:52:12,058 --> 01:52:15,185
Uh, my client
didn't officially register, Your Honor.

1646
01:52:15,353 --> 01:52:20,482
But l think the circumstances call
for immediate action, uh...

1647
01:52:20,650 --> 01:52:22,151
...for the safety of the child.

1648
01:52:22,318 --> 01:52:26,321
The problem is, judge,
is that my ex-wife, ahem...

1649
01:52:26,489 --> 01:52:31,660
...she's a sick person, and she needs help.
She deals in sex and drugs for a living.

1650
01:52:31,828 --> 01:52:33,787
No, I don't do drugs.

1651
01:52:33,955 --> 01:52:37,291
Your Honor, she has been
in and out of trouble with the law...

1652
01:52:37,459 --> 01:52:39,293
...on several occasions
for this sort of thing.

1653
01:52:39,461 --> 01:52:42,796
No, no. No, not anymore. No.

1654
01:52:42,964 --> 01:52:45,257
Have you ever been arrested?

1655
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:48,343
Yes.

1656
01:52:49,596 --> 01:52:54,183
When was the last time you were arrested,
and, uh, what was the charge?

1657
01:53:11,910 --> 01:53:15,662
Okay, okay, okay,
let's get ready for this experiment.

1658
01:53:16,206 --> 01:53:18,540
Hi. Jack Horner here.

1659
01:53:18,708 --> 01:53:22,878
Uh, we're in the back of this beautiful
limousine in the back seat...

1660
01:53:23,046 --> 01:53:26,632
...riding along west on Sherman Way.

1661
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:32,721
And beside me is a beautiful, talented,
gorgeous, young actress...

1662
01:53:32,889 --> 01:53:36,141
...from adult cinema, Miss Rollergirl.

1663
01:53:36,309 --> 01:53:38,602
Hi. Hello. Howdy.

1664
01:53:38,770 --> 01:53:41,605
Are you ready
to get on with this experiment?

1665
01:53:41,773 --> 01:53:44,441
-Ready. Ready like Freddy.
-Ha-ha-ha.

1666
01:53:44,609 --> 01:53:49,488
Yes. And we're, uh, going along,
like I said, west on Sherman Way...

1667
01:53:49,656 --> 01:53:53,242
...and this is called On the Lookout.

1668
01:53:53,409 --> 01:53:57,246
That's the name of this show.
On the lookout for a young stud...

1669
01:53:57,413 --> 01:54:00,666
...who maybe
will get in the back seat here...

1670
01:54:00,834 --> 01:54:04,169
...and get it on with Rollergirl.

1671
01:54:04,337 --> 01:54:09,258
Uh, and we're going to make
film history...

1672
01:54:09,425 --> 01:54:11,927
...right here on videotape.

1673
01:54:25,733 --> 01:54:28,652
- Hello?
- Hey.

1674
01:54:29,279 --> 01:54:31,321
Waiting for someone?

1675
01:54:32,615 --> 01:54:34,157
Yeah.

1676
01:54:34,325 --> 01:54:38,495
I'm waiting for somebody, but l'm not sure
if they're gonna show up, though.

1677
01:54:39,372 --> 01:54:41,415
You wanna wait in the car?

1678
01:54:43,418 --> 01:54:44,877
Cool.

1679
01:55:12,989 --> 01:55:14,740
I'm Joe.

1680
01:55:15,491 --> 01:55:17,326
Dirk.

1681
01:55:19,996 --> 01:55:21,997
You know who l am?

1682
01:55:24,042 --> 01:55:25,667
No.

1683
01:55:27,086 --> 01:55:29,338
My name's Dirk Diggler.

1684
01:55:30,924 --> 01:55:32,507
No.

1685
01:55:33,009 --> 01:55:36,136
I mean, you're a guy.
I'm just helping you out.

1686
01:55:36,721 --> 01:55:38,180
Yeah.

1687
01:55:39,349 --> 01:55:40,599
What do you see here?

1688
01:55:41,976 --> 01:55:43,852
Well, l see a girl. Ha, ha.

1689
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:46,605
Ha, yeah. Well, you like what you see?

1690
01:55:46,773 --> 01:55:51,526
- Um, yeah. Yeah, l do.
-Ha, ha, all right. Get in.

1691
01:55:51,694 --> 01:55:56,031
Get in and let's make film history.

1692
01:55:58,743 --> 01:56:00,535
So...

1693
01:56:01,329 --> 01:56:03,121
...what do you wanna do?

1694
01:56:04,123 --> 01:56:06,291
It's what you wanna do.

1695
01:56:08,294 --> 01:56:10,212
I wanna watch you.

1696
01:56:11,381 --> 01:56:14,174
I mean, l'm not gay. I just wanna....

1697
01:56:15,343 --> 01:56:18,470
Maybe you could jerk off a little,
and l could watch.

1698
01:56:19,681 --> 01:56:23,225
Maybe I'll join in later,
but for now, I just wanna watch.

1699
01:56:25,395 --> 01:56:27,187
Twenty bucks.

1700
01:56:29,399 --> 01:56:31,441
Ten's all l have.

1701
01:56:35,697 --> 01:56:37,280
You go to school?

1702
01:56:37,448 --> 01:56:40,075
Um, yeah. Yeah, l do.

1703
01:56:40,243 --> 01:56:42,119
Where do you go to school?

1704
01:56:42,286 --> 01:56:43,954
Um....

1705
01:56:44,372 --> 01:56:46,331
Is it okay if l don't tell you?

1706
01:56:46,499 --> 01:56:48,667
Yeah. Yeah, that's cool.

1707
01:56:48,835 --> 01:56:50,252
Ahem.

1708
01:56:50,420 --> 01:56:52,587
You recognize Rollergirl from her films?

1709
01:56:52,755 --> 01:56:57,300
Yep. Ha, ha, yeah. Yeah,
we watch her films a lot at my frat house.

1710
01:56:57,468 --> 01:57:00,554
-I go to, uh-- I go to CSUN.
- Wonderful.

1711
01:57:00,722 --> 01:57:03,432
Yeah, the fucking guys
will never believe this, ha, ha.

1712
01:57:04,559 --> 01:57:09,229
So, you know, we've done a whole
bunch of films together, Rollergirl and l.

1713
01:57:09,605 --> 01:57:11,106
Do you remember me?

1714
01:57:11,274 --> 01:57:12,774
Ahem.

1715
01:57:12,942 --> 01:57:15,193
We went to school together.

1716
01:57:16,904 --> 01:57:18,989
Your name's Brandy, right?

1717
01:57:20,116 --> 01:57:22,951
Brandy? Brandy's your name, right?

1718
01:57:24,579 --> 01:57:26,204
No.

1719
01:57:26,456 --> 01:57:29,499
-l don't know what you're talking about.
- Your name's not Brandy?

1720
01:57:33,296 --> 01:57:36,048
Well, ha-- Okay.

1721
01:57:39,552 --> 01:57:42,471
Maybe--? Maybe do it harder?

1722
01:57:51,731 --> 01:57:54,900
Faster. Do it a little faster.

1723
01:57:58,279 --> 01:58:00,238
All right.

1724
01:58:03,576 --> 01:58:07,829
You're hiding her again.
Let's get on the other side. That's it.

1725
01:58:09,499 --> 01:58:13,043
Just nice and sexy, you know....

1726
01:58:13,211 --> 01:58:14,878
Yeah.

1727
01:58:19,884 --> 01:58:23,845
Listen, pal, you gotta make it
a little more sexy, you know?

1728
01:58:24,013 --> 01:58:26,598
Don't just ram it in there like that.

1729
01:58:26,766 --> 01:58:29,810
This is not a hole in the wall, pal.
This is Rollergirl.

1730
01:58:30,269 --> 01:58:31,853
Faster.

1731
01:58:35,233 --> 01:58:37,109
Do it faster.

1732
01:58:38,027 --> 01:58:41,196
-Get your hand wet.
-Be quiet.

1733
01:58:43,366 --> 01:58:47,202
Can you be more sexy?
Like, uh, cinematically sexy.

1734
01:58:47,370 --> 01:58:49,246
Just don't ram it. Don't--

1735
01:58:50,748 --> 01:58:53,875
Be respectful. This is Rollergirl.

1736
01:58:54,752 --> 01:58:56,086
Are you listening to me, kid?

1737
01:58:56,254 --> 01:58:59,256
-Just let me do my thing. l know what--
-This is stupid, Jack.

1738
01:58:59,423 --> 01:59:03,593
Okay, that's it. Hold it. Cut. Pull over.

1739
01:59:04,053 --> 01:59:05,178
Pull over.

1740
01:59:13,437 --> 01:59:16,773
I can't fucking believe this.
Jesus Christ, you gave me a hard-on, lady.

1741
01:59:16,941 --> 01:59:19,568
The least you could do
is jack me off or something.

1742
01:59:20,194 --> 01:59:21,945
What the fuck did you say?

1743
01:59:23,364 --> 01:59:26,616
I just said it's not that cool
to leave me with a hard-on, all right?

1744
01:59:26,784 --> 01:59:28,785
Fuck you.

1745
01:59:30,913 --> 01:59:33,290
I don't fucking believe this.

1746
01:59:35,543 --> 01:59:37,627
This is a fine life
you've made for yourself.

1747
01:59:39,547 --> 01:59:41,715
You really should be proud.

1748
01:59:41,924 --> 01:59:43,800
I mean, really.

1749
01:59:45,595 --> 01:59:48,597
-Fucker.
-Yeah, fuck you.

1750
01:59:49,432 --> 01:59:51,683
And your fucking films suck now anyway.

1751
01:59:57,523 --> 01:59:59,274
Come on.

1752
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:05,113
I can't. l can't get it hard, all right?
I just can't. l'm sorry.

1753
02:00:09,869 --> 02:00:13,413
You just shouldn't
do this sort of thing, faggot.

1754
02:00:13,581 --> 02:00:14,956
Get out of the car, man!

1755
02:00:15,124 --> 02:00:17,918
Jack, Jesus. No, Jack. Jack.

1756
02:00:18,085 --> 02:00:20,754
Jack. Jack. Hey.

1757
02:00:20,922 --> 02:00:22,214
Jack. Jack.

1758
02:00:22,381 --> 02:00:24,841
Get him out of the fucking truck, man!

1759
02:00:25,009 --> 02:00:26,635
You shouldn't be coming down here.

1760
02:00:26,802 --> 02:00:30,347
Jack. Jack. Jesus Christ.

1761
02:00:30,514 --> 02:00:33,892
-Come on, Jack. Jack.
- You little fucker.

1762
02:00:34,060 --> 02:00:36,686
- You piece of shit. You faggot.
- Fuck you.

1763
02:00:36,854 --> 02:00:38,480
Faggot, you like that?

1764
02:00:38,648 --> 02:00:41,149
-Jack. Jack.
-Amateur fucker.

1765
02:00:42,360 --> 02:00:43,944
Come on.

1766
02:00:51,994 --> 02:00:54,329
You don't ever disrespect me.

1767
02:00:54,497 --> 02:00:58,250
Fucker! You don't ever disrespect me,
you fucker!

1768
02:00:58,417 --> 02:01:02,003
-Motherfucker, look at you now, huh?
- That's what you get, faggot.

1769
02:01:02,171 --> 02:01:05,131
You think you can fuck?
You can't fuck me, you fucker!

1770
02:01:05,633 --> 02:01:09,344
You can't touch me!
You can't touch me, you fucker!

1771
02:01:09,512 --> 02:01:10,887
Stop it.

1772
02:01:12,890 --> 02:01:17,852
-You don't do this, donkey-dick. You don't.
-Unh!

1773
02:01:18,271 --> 02:01:20,063
Fucking faggot.

1774
02:01:24,527 --> 02:01:29,030
-You don't ever disrespect me, you fucker!
- Come on.

1775
02:01:29,198 --> 02:01:31,533
You fucking piece of shit!

1776
02:01:31,701 --> 02:01:37,205
You fucking-- Fucking die, you shithead!

1777
02:02:14,201 --> 02:02:15,785
-Okay.
-Okay.

1778
02:02:15,953 --> 02:02:20,457
-What do you want?
-l want an apple fritter, jelly...

1779
02:02:20,624 --> 02:02:25,253
...um, chocolate with sprinkles,

1780
02:02:25,421 --> 02:02:28,590
-A bear claw. Okay.
-Yeah. And hurry.

1781
02:02:28,758 --> 02:02:31,676
Hey, how's my little kung-fu fighter?

1782
02:02:31,844 --> 02:02:33,970
He's kicking ass inside my stomach.

1783
02:02:34,138 --> 02:02:36,306
-Ha, ha. See? That's a boy.
-Uh-huh.

1784
02:02:36,474 --> 02:02:37,849
Okay.

1785
02:02:39,810 --> 02:02:42,562
-Okay, be right back.
-Okay.

1786
02:02:44,607 --> 02:02:47,359
-Hey.
-Hey, what's up? Can I help you?

1787
02:02:47,526 --> 02:02:50,195
-Yeah. Uh, I'm gonna get a dozen.
-All right.

1788
02:02:55,034 --> 02:02:58,286
Let me get, uh, a couple bear claws.

1789
02:02:59,205 --> 02:03:01,831
-Two bear claws.
-Yeah.

1790
02:03:03,125 --> 02:03:05,126
A couple glazed.

1791
02:03:07,296 --> 02:03:10,799
Oh, apple fritter. No, no. Not that one.
The one in front of it.

1792
02:03:10,966 --> 02:03:15,053
-Yeah, that one. That one. That one.
-Okay.

1793
02:03:17,765 --> 02:03:20,392
Oh, yeah. Two chocolate.

1794
02:03:21,227 --> 02:03:22,268

02:05:28,103 --> 02:05:29,854
All right, this could be the thing.

1816
02:05:30,022 --> 02:05:32,273
Something to help us
score a little extra cash.

1817
02:05:32,775 --> 02:05:36,444
The guy's name is Rahad Jackson.
He's got more money than God.

1818
02:05:36,612 --> 02:05:39,531
He's got twice as much coke, crank,
and smack. All right?

1819
02:05:39,698 --> 02:05:43,159
This guy's gonna buy just about anything
anybody wants to sell him.

1820
02:05:43,327 --> 02:05:47,080
Just likes people hanging around
at his house partying, the whole thing.

1821
02:05:47,248 --> 02:05:48,623
How do you know him?

1822
02:05:48,791 --> 02:05:51,459
He used to come to Party Boys a lot.
Mutrix introduced me.

1823
02:05:51,627 --> 02:05:54,087
How will we do it exactly?
How would it all go down?

1824
02:05:54,255 --> 02:05:57,173
lt's gonna go down like this.
I'm gonna call him on the phone...

1825
02:05:57,341 --> 02:06:00,677
...and l'm gonna tell him
I got a half a key of quality stuff.

1826
02:06:00,844 --> 02:06:02,804
Do you have his phone number?

1827
02:06:02,972 --> 02:06:04,389
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1828
02:06:04,557 --> 02:06:07,767
So l'm gonna call him on the phone.
I'm gonna give him a price.

1829
02:06:07,935 --> 02:06:08,977
How much?

1830
02:06:09,144 --> 02:06:11,479
Well, it's half a key, man.
It's, like, 5000 bucks.

1831
02:06:11,647 --> 02:06:14,899
-You split that up three ways....
- It's enough to get the Vette fixed.

1832
02:06:15,067 --> 02:06:18,111
That's right, man.
So we're gonna do the deal.

1833
02:06:18,279 --> 02:06:20,822
We're gonna drop
half a key of baking soda into a bag.

1834
02:06:20,990 --> 02:06:22,991
We're gonna walk over there.
We're gonna--

1835
02:06:24,493 --> 02:06:26,786
Boom. Right there.

1836
02:06:26,954 --> 02:06:31,040
-This could be a nifty bit of hustle-bustle.
- Wait. Do you have his address?

1837
02:06:31,208 --> 02:06:33,376
Fucking, Reed, yeah.
I got his fucking address.

1838
02:06:33,544 --> 02:06:36,212
What? Yeah, okay, question. Sorry.

1839
02:06:36,380 --> 02:06:39,507
Hold on. What if he tests the stuff out?

1840
02:06:40,092 --> 02:06:42,343
- He won't.
-Well, how do you know that?

1841
02:06:42,845 --> 02:06:46,431
Because I know he won't. l'm positive.

1842
02:06:46,599 --> 02:06:48,850
You guys should be careful.

1843
02:06:49,018 --> 02:06:51,185
- Scotty.
-What?

1844
02:06:51,353 --> 02:06:52,520
What do you mean, "What?"

1845
02:06:52,688 --> 02:06:56,566
Do me a favor. Just mind your business,
please. What the fuck?

1846
02:06:56,734 --> 02:06:58,234
Sorry.

1847
02:06:58,402 --> 02:07:00,194
Anyway, heh....

1848
02:07:00,362 --> 02:07:02,864
Dump it in there good. Dump it in clean.

1849
02:07:04,408 --> 02:07:06,534
Hey, hey, hey,
you can't lay this all on me, man.

1850
02:07:06,702 --> 02:07:08,870
We're gonna go in there-- This is it.

1851
02:07:09,038 --> 02:07:10,496
Fine.

1852
02:07:12,541 --> 02:07:14,334
You guys ready for this?

1853
02:07:14,501 --> 02:07:16,210

1854
02:07:16,378 --> 02:07:20,715
-Me? Yeah, yeah. I was born ready, man.
-All right.

1855
02:07:22,092 --> 02:07:23,718
-What the fuck is that?
-lt's a big gun.

1856
02:07:23,886 --> 02:07:26,179
-No shit, but why?
-Just in case.

1857
02:07:26,347 --> 02:07:28,556
Shit.

1858
02:07:28,891 --> 02:07:29,932
Fucking great.

1859
02:07:30,100 --> 02:07:31,976
-You never said anything about a gun.
- Shh.

1860
02:07:32,144 --> 02:07:33,561
Now I'm nervous. Do you have a gun?

1861
02:07:33,729 --> 02:07:35,897
-No, I don't have a gun. He never said--
-Shh. Relax.

1862
02:07:36,065 --> 02:07:40,318
-Let's just get in and out, all right? ln, out.
-Not too fast. It makes it look suspicious.

1863
02:07:41,737 --> 02:07:43,321
Goddamn it.

1864
02:07:43,489 --> 02:07:45,406
You all right?

1865
02:07:45,574 --> 02:07:48,785
-Just let me do all the talking, all right?
-Just be cool.

1866
02:07:59,546 --> 02:08:02,298
How you doing? Come on in.

1867
02:08:05,678 --> 02:08:07,637

-Hey, man.

Good to see you.
Take a seat. You want something to drink?

1877
02:08:44,174 --> 02:08:45,842
-Want a pill? Coke? Little dope?
- No.

1878
02:08:46,009 --> 02:08:48,928
-Uh, you sure you don't want something?
- No, thank you. No.

1879
02:08:49,513 --> 02:08:52,306
So got something? Huh?

02:08:52,474 --> 02:08:54,016
We got something here?

1881
02:08:54,643 --> 02:08:56,853
Here it is.
That's about half a key right there.

1882
02:08:58,313 --> 02:09:00,356
-All right.

-No, no, no. Wait.

1885

Here's that build-up. l love this part.

1886
02:09:19,710 --> 02:09:21,002
Fucking love that song.

1887
02:09:22,671 --> 02:09:24,672
So anyway, uh, what's the price?

1888
02:09:29,845 --> 02:09:39,437
Well, ha-ha-ha, we, ha-ha-ha....

1890
02:09:45,611 --> 02:09:48,154
-Five grand.

02:09:58,123 --> 02:09:59,582
Five grand?

02:09:59,750 --> 02:10:01,584
Five grand.

1894
02:10:05,672 --> 02:10:07,340
Okay.

1895
02:10:21,730 --> 02:10:23,356
You guys wanna play baseball?

1896
02:10:23,941 --> 02:10:25,983
-No, thank you.
-No.

1897
02:10:27,736 --> 02:10:31,364
The black guy has a gun in his jacket.
Todd?

1898
02:10:40,082 --> 02:10:42,166
Let's get up and get the fuck out of here.

1899
02:10:42,334 --> 02:10:44,085
Todd, count the fucking money in the car.

1900
02:11:00,561 --> 02:11:04,647
Hey, you wanna see something
really fascinating?

1901
02:11:08,861 --> 02:11:11,279
-Check it out.
-Oh, wow. That's sweet.

1902
02:11:13,782 --> 02:11:15,658

1905
02:11:20,956 --> 02:11:24,250
-Could you not point the gun, please, sir?
- Ha-ha-ha.

1906
02:11:24,418 --> 02:11:25,459
-Todd.
-You wanna watch.

1907
02:11:26,962 --> 02:11:29,255
-Why? You think l can't do it?

1908
02:11:29,423 --> 02:11:31,966
-Huh? Ha-ha-ha. You think I can't do it?
- Sir?

1909
02:11:32,134 --> 02:11:34,969
-You wanna see me do it? You dare me?
-No, we don't dare you.

1910
02:11:36,305 --> 02:11:37,471
Fucking dare me.

1911
02:11:43,478 --> 02:11:45,646
Thank you, thank you.

1912
02:11:47,649 --> 02:11:49,859
Your fucking faces, man.

1913
02:11:53,363 --> 02:11:55,197
What the fuck?

1914
02:11:56,491 --> 02:11:59,869
Hey, I love this thing. l make these
little mix tapes together, you know?

1915
02:12:00,037 --> 02:12:04,290
I put all my favorite songs together.
Which one is this? Number, uh, 11. I love it.

1916
02:12:04,458 --> 02:12:07,501
You know, when you buy a tape
or something or an album...

1917
02:12:07,669 --> 02:12:11,172
...you put it on, and the songs,
the bands put them in some fucking order...

1918
02:12:11,340 --> 02:12:15,217
...like they want you to listen to it
in that order. I hate that. Fucking hate that.

1919
02:12:15,385 --> 02:12:19,013
I don't like to be told what to listen to,
when to listen to it, or anything.

1920
02:12:27,522 --> 02:12:28,648
Fuck.

1921
02:12:30,567 --> 02:12:33,694
It's Cosmo. He's Chinese.

1922
02:12:34,446 --> 02:12:37,365
That's why he likes
lighting off firecrackers. Huh?

1923
02:13:12,234 --> 02:13:14,568
Ricky Springfield. He's a buddy of mine.

1924
02:13:31,753 --> 02:13:35,047
Todd, we're leaving, man. Todd.

1925
02:13:35,215 --> 02:13:37,591
Let's go. All right?

1926
02:14:18,383 --> 02:14:19,633
We're leaving.

1927
02:14:19,801 --> 02:14:22,720
Sir. We gotta split, man. We gotta go.

1928
02:14:22,888 --> 02:14:25,639
Aw, come on. You just got here.
Let's hang out, let's party.

1929
02:14:25,807 --> 02:14:29,685
We got somewhere else to go.
We scheduled dinner with friends.

1930
02:14:29,853 --> 02:14:31,812
We're not leaving yet.

1931
02:14:34,483 --> 02:14:38,069
We're here now,
and we want something else from you.

1932
02:14:39,029 --> 02:14:40,780
Hey.

1933
02:14:40,947 --> 02:14:42,364
Hey, hey, hey.

1934
02:14:44,451 --> 02:14:46,786
We want something else from you.

1935
02:14:47,621 --> 02:14:48,662
What?

1936
02:14:48,830 --> 02:14:51,415
Todd, what the hell are you doing, man?
Let's just go.

1937
02:14:52,667 --> 02:14:54,835
In the master bedroom...

1938
02:14:55,837 --> 02:14:59,632
...under the bed in a floor safe.

1939
02:14:59,800 --> 02:15:01,217
Understand?

1940
02:15:01,843 --> 02:15:04,261
-What is the matter with you? Let's go.
-Todd.

1941
02:15:04,429 --> 02:15:05,846
- Come on, man.
-Shut up, Dirk.

1942
02:15:06,014 --> 02:15:08,349
I told you l got a plan.
I got a very good plan.

1943
02:15:09,309 --> 02:15:11,018
Are you kidding me, kitty?

1944
02:15:11,186 --> 02:15:12,812
No, I'm not, see?

1945
02:15:12,979 --> 02:15:15,940
I'm not kidding.
I want what's in the safe.

1946
02:15:16,108 --> 02:15:19,318
We want what is in the goddamn safe,
in the goddamn master bedroom...

1947
02:15:19,486 --> 02:15:22,863
...in the fucking floor,
in a goddamn fucking floor safe, that's all.

1948
02:15:23,031 --> 02:15:24,490
Todd, don't be crazy, okay?

1949
02:15:24,658 --> 02:15:28,077
Sir, we don't know anything about this.
This is not at all what we wanted.

1950
02:15:28,245 --> 02:15:31,455
Shut the fuck up, Dirk.
Do not reach for your gun, man.

1951
02:15:31,623 --> 02:15:33,374
Don't reach for your gun.

1952
02:15:47,722 --> 02:15:48,764
He went in the bedroom.

1953
02:15:49,391 --> 02:15:51,142
Todd, what the fuck are you doing?

1954
02:15:51,601 --> 02:15:54,728
-He went in the bedroom.
-Todd, when the fuck did you go crazy?

1955
02:15:54,896 --> 02:15:58,065
He's got coke, and he's got cash
in that safe in that bedroom...

1956
02:15:58,233 --> 02:16:01,068
...and if we leave here without it,
we're fucking idiots, man.

1957
02:16:01,236 --> 02:16:03,237
We came here
to motherfucking do something.

1958
02:16:03,405 --> 02:16:05,656
And we can fucking do it, all right?
You with me?

1959
02:16:05,824 --> 02:16:10,244
Todd, listen to me. Let's just split, man.
Let's just split now. This is not the thing.

1960
02:16:10,412 --> 02:16:12,246
This is not supposed to be the thing.

1961
02:16:12,414 --> 02:16:15,666
That's what l goddamn came here
to motherfucking do.

1962
02:16:15,834 --> 02:16:18,544
And that's what l'm gonna fucking do
right the fuck now.

1963
02:16:18,712 --> 02:16:21,005
Fuck no! Todd, don't!

1964
02:16:21,173 --> 02:16:23,090
-Don't be fucking stupid!
-Todd! Todd!

1965
02:16:26,428 --> 02:16:28,345
-Come on!
- Fuck! Go, man!

1966
02:16:28,513 --> 02:16:29,930
Come on, you puppies.

1967
02:16:34,436 --> 02:16:36,187
It's coming down for puppies!

1968
02:16:43,737 --> 02:16:47,323
Come on, come on, come on. Puppies!

1969
02:16:48,033 --> 02:16:49,992
No!

1970
02:16:51,411 --> 02:16:53,078
Oh, shit.

1971
02:16:53,788 --> 02:16:55,414
Come on!

1972
02:16:59,711 --> 02:17:00,794
Shit.

1973
02:17:16,269 --> 02:17:19,480
Fucking son of a bitch. Oh, God.

1974
02:17:19,648 --> 02:17:22,900
Oh, God. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

1975
02:17:23,068 --> 02:17:27,238
Fuck. Fucking stupid motherfucker.

1976
02:17:27,405 --> 02:17:29,531
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

1977
02:17:33,954 --> 02:17:35,663
Oh, fuck.

1978
02:17:36,498 --> 02:17:40,042
Oh, fuck. Son of a bitch.

1979
02:18:26,506 --> 02:18:28,215
Jack?

1980
02:18:35,181 --> 02:18:38,309
Jack, could you please help me?

1981
02:18:48,528 --> 02:18:50,029

02:19:40,497 --> 02:19:42,623
I'm so fucking sorry, Jack.

02:19:46,544 --> 02:19:48,796
I'm sorry too, kid.

1992
02:19:51,299 --> 02:19:53,675
It's okay, baby.

1993
02:19:53,843 --> 02:19:56,720
-We all need to start again.
-Yeah.

1994
02:19:56,888 --> 02:19:58,806
Okay.

1995
02:19:58,973 --> 02:20:00,849
Shh.

1996
02:20:01,017 --> 02:20:02,684
It's okay.

1997
02:20:06,481 --> 02:20:08,607
It's okay, baby.

1998
02:20:08,775 --> 02:20:10,692
Shh.

1999
02:20:10,860 --> 02:20:14,571
Yeah. You're all right, baby.

2000
02:20:14,739 --> 02:20:17,366
- One more. Let's go. Please. Eleven.
- Eleven.

2001
02:20:17,534 --> 02:20:19,034
Yeah.

2002
02:20:22,997 --> 02:20:25,165
Did I hear someone say deal?

2003
02:20:25,333 --> 02:20:27,501
This weekend and this weekend only...

2004
02:20:27,669 --> 02:20:32,005
...Buck's Super Cool Stereo Store is making
super-cool deals on all name brands.

2005
02:20:32,173 --> 02:20:33,590
We're open. We're ready.

2006
02:20:33,758 --> 02:20:37,511
All you need to do is walk over,
get down, and come inside us.

2007
02:20:39,848 --> 02:20:41,432
Word.

2008
02:20:41,850 --> 02:20:44,601
Cut. Excellent.

2009
02:20:44,769 --> 02:20:47,229
Buck, honey, that was great.

2010
02:21:03,121 --> 02:21:04,663
I said, shut up, Colonel.

2011
02:21:06,833 --> 02:21:08,917
Shut up, Colonel.

2012
02:21:12,630 --> 02:21:14,715
I said, shut up.

2013
02:21:17,469 --> 02:21:24,057
Cinco, cuatro, tres, dos, uno.

2014
02:21:36,404 --> 02:21:39,656
Wait, wait, wait. What happened there?

2015
02:21:39,824 --> 02:21:46,580
That's a Q. That's supposed to be a G.
Oh, man. No, no.

2016
02:22:07,185 --> 02:22:08,769
Go.

2017
02:22:13,942 --> 02:22:15,651
What the heck?

2018
02:22:16,694 --> 02:22:19,279
Naughty, naughty, Candy.

2019
02:22:21,199 --> 02:22:22,658
-Push.
-Okay, ready to push?

2020
02:22:22,825 --> 02:22:24,451
Okay, let's push. Let's push. Let's push.

2021
02:22:25,828 --> 02:22:29,331
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.
Go, go, go. Push, push, push.

2022
02:22:29,499 --> 02:22:31,124
Yes. Yes.

2023
02:22:31,292 --> 02:22:33,710
-God almighty, fucking Christ.
-We're almost there.

2024
02:22:33,878 --> 02:22:36,630
-No, don't cuss, sweetie.
- One big push for me, all right?

2025
02:22:36,798 --> 02:22:40,217
Big push for the doctor. Big push.
This is it. Big push. Push, push, push.

2026
02:22:43,012 --> 02:22:45,138
- I got it, I got it, yeah.
-He got it.

2027
02:22:45,306 --> 02:22:46,765
It's a boy. lt's a boy.

2028
02:22:54,816 --> 02:22:56,900
No hurry, guys.
Just sometime this year, huh?

2029
02:22:57,068 --> 02:23:01,572
-Jack, should we put it in the garage?
- Put it where l told you to put it.

2030
02:23:02,699 --> 02:23:03,949
Oh.

2031
02:23:04,117 --> 02:23:05,909
Maurice.

2032
02:23:06,661 --> 02:23:10,038
-You've got to turn a fan on.
- lt smells good, doesn't it?

2033
02:23:10,206 --> 02:23:11,665
No. It smells like shit.

2034
02:23:11,833 --> 02:23:14,001
Oh, come on. This is Puerto Rican cooking.

2035
02:23:14,168 --> 02:23:16,503
Everybody's complaining
in the whole neighborhood.

2036
02:23:16,671 --> 02:23:18,672
This is what they're complaining about.
Taste this.

2037
02:23:18,840 --> 02:23:21,550
No, I can't taste it, not now.
I'll taste it later.

2038
02:23:24,095 --> 02:23:26,138
Rollergirl, yoo-hoo.

2039
02:23:26,306 --> 02:23:27,764
Honey, honey. Listen to me.

2040
02:23:27,932 --> 02:23:31,143
Take the dirt on one side of your room
and move it to the other side.

2041
02:23:31,311 --> 02:23:33,687
-Okay.
-Then one side of the room will look clean...

2042
02:23:33,855 --> 02:23:36,189
...that used to look dirty.
That'll be good, huh?

2043
02:23:37,692 --> 02:23:41,445
Oh! Johnny Weissmuller.
That's my swimmer.

2044
02:23:41,613 --> 02:23:44,615
- Say, "Hello, Uncle Jack."
-Five gold medals, look at that.

2045
02:23:44,782 --> 02:23:47,784
- Say, "Hello, Uncle Jack."
- Oh, look at him.

2046
02:23:47,952 --> 02:23:51,622
-You like Uncle Jack's pool?
- Who is the Olympic-fever baby?

2047
02:23:51,998 --> 02:23:54,249
-Who's the Olympic-fever baby?
-Say, "Hi, Jack."

2048
02:23:54,417 --> 02:23:55,792
- Say, "Hi. Hi."
-"Hi, Jack."

2049
02:23:55,960 --> 02:23:58,629
- "Watch me kick."
-He's not gonna piss in the pool, is he?

2050
02:23:58,796 --> 02:24:02,674
-l don't think so.
- Do you like Uncle Reed? Yes, you do.

2051
02:24:02,842 --> 02:24:04,509
- He is a good boy.
- Yo, Buck.

2052
02:24:04,677 --> 02:24:07,721
I gotta talk to you about
the stereo modification for this system.

2053
02:24:07,889 --> 02:24:09,389
-No technical shit.
-No, no, no.

2054
02:24:09,557 --> 02:24:12,434
If you don't get the right modification
it's not gonna be loud.

2055
02:24:12,602 --> 02:24:14,561
Loud isn't what l want.
I don't want loud.

2056
02:24:14,729 --> 02:24:16,063
-l want....
- Mellow.

2057
02:24:16,230 --> 02:24:18,523
Mellow. That's what I want.

2058
02:24:18,691 --> 02:24:20,734
- Okay.
-Buck, l want mellow.

2059
02:24:20,902 --> 02:24:23,570
Mellow. Mellow.

2060
02:24:23,738 --> 02:24:25,238
Yeah.

2061
02:24:25,406 --> 02:24:28,492
Oh, great, honey. Great.

2062
02:24:38,086 --> 02:24:40,087
Are we ready?

2063
02:24:40,254 --> 02:24:44,049
We have got all the time we want.

2064
02:24:44,801 --> 02:24:46,718
What are you looking at?

2065
02:24:47,303 --> 02:24:50,389
-l'm looking at you.
-You're staring.

2066
02:24:50,556 --> 02:24:52,599
You know what l'm staring at?

2067
02:24:53,601 --> 02:24:59,356
I'm staring at the foxiest bitch
in the whole world.

2068
02:25:28,094 --> 02:25:30,554
I've been around this block twice now.

2069
02:25:30,722 --> 02:25:32,639
I'm looking for something.

2070
02:25:32,807 --> 02:25:34,391
A clue.

2071
02:25:34,934 --> 02:25:38,061
I've been looking for clues,
and something led me back here.

2072
02:25:38,479 --> 02:25:41,356
Yep. So here l am.

2073
02:25:41,691 --> 02:25:45,318
Could have been me, the one that was
at Ringo's place when the shit went down.

2074
02:25:45,486 --> 02:25:49,406
Hey, I know how it is. I've been there.

2075
02:25:49,657 --> 02:25:51,992
We've all done bad things.

2076
02:25:52,160 --> 02:25:55,287
We've all had those guilty feelings
in our heart.

2077
02:25:55,663 --> 02:26:00,000
You wanna take your brain out of your head
and wash it and scrub it and make it clean.

2078
02:26:00,168 --> 02:26:01,960
Well, no.

2079
02:26:04,005 --> 02:26:06,339
But l'm gonna help you settle this.

2080
02:26:06,507 --> 02:26:09,551
First we're gonna check for holes,
see what we can find.

2081
02:26:09,719 --> 02:26:14,055
Then we're gonna get nice and wet
and you're gonna spread your legs.

2082
02:26:14,474 --> 02:26:18,101
Oh, that's good. So you know me.

2083
02:26:18,269 --> 02:26:20,437
You know my reputation.

2084
02:26:20,605 --> 02:26:24,191
Thirteen inches is a tough load.
I don't treat you gently.

2085
02:26:24,358 --> 02:26:28,528
That's right. l'm Brock Landers.

2086
02:26:29,155 --> 02:26:38,789
So l'm gonna be nice.

2087
02:26:38,956 --> 02:26:41,124
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

2088
02:26:41,292 --> 02:26:44,336
Where the fuck is Ringo?

2089
02:27:09,111 --> 02:27:11,196
I am a star.

2090
02:27:11,405 --> 02:27:14,241
I'm a star. I'm a star. l'm a star.

2091
02:27:14,408 --> 02:27:17,619
I am a big, bright, shining star.

2092
02:27:33,719 --> 02:27:35,428
That's right.

2093
02:34:28,634 --> 02:34:30,385
I just....

2094
02:34:37,476 --> 02:34:39,519
l just wanna talk to you.

2095
02:34:44,650 --> 02:34:46,526
I just want....

2096
02:34:48,028 --> 02:34:49,779
