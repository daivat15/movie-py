Ten years from now,
where do I wanna be?

3
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:48,506
I wanna be... just living, man. Just
living comfortably with my wife, you know.

4
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,843
Just layin' back. Just chilling.
You know what I'm saying? Living.

5
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:55,847
Where do I think I'll be
in 10 years?

6
00:00:55,931 --> 00:01:00,184
I don't think I'll be seeing it, dog, for real,
man. I don't think my luck is that good.

7
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:03,980
I hope it is, but if it ain't,
so be it. I'm ready.

20
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,560
Yo, what's up, ma?
What's up?

21
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,438
You looking fine.
I'm going to have to get your number.

22
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:29,565
I don't know.
What's up with you?

23
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:36,072
In the beginning,
God gave me a clean slate.

24
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,960
But where I grew up,
I knew I couldn't stay clean.

25
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,920
If you was a nice, ordinary kid,

26
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:55,883
you was an easy mark for the wannabe gangsters
and cutthroat girls in the school yard.

Y'all want our autograph?
We gonna be in a magazine one day.

36
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,871
Chris Shy-ass
can't be in no magazine.

37
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,164
He's too fat, black and ugly.

38
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:33,296
At least there ain't
no train tracks in my mouth.

39
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:37,216
What do I tell you?
If you just pay attention,

40
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:41,470
you study hard, always do your
best and look what happens.

41
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,223
A hundred percent!

42
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,602
I'm proud of you, Chrissy-poo.
Don't call me that!

43
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:51,022
Oh, I forgot.
You're all grown-up now, huh?

44
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:55,526
My moms was from a small town in Jamaica
where they left the doors unlocked at night.

45
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,947
But in our neighborhood,
the only time she let me off the stoop...

46
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,949
was when she walked me
home from school.

47
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:06,495
We've seen that 12, 13 times.
Don't you wanna see something different?

48
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,124
This was Brooklyn.
Do-or-die Bed-Stuy.

49
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,336
- And there was just some shit
Moms couldn't protect me from.

50
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:18,841
Voletta.

51
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:27,808
Christopher, say hello to your father.

52
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,190
You are still beautiful,
Voletta.

53
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,987
If that's what you came for
you can leave right now.

54
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,200
Sugar?

55
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,759
A hundred dollars.

56
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,845
Is that all he's worth to you?

57
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,350
Are you even planning on
being in his life?

58
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,103
- Things are complicated.
- Things?

59
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,105
I feel like
if you and I could just

60
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,402
It was easy to lie about your wife.

61
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,738
Now, when it comes to your child,
"things" are complicated.

62
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,826

teaches you how to knock.

Please. Don't you mock your prayers.

- Would you hurry up before you make us both late for class?

What's wrong with you?

154
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,665
If you're carrying my seed,
it means you are my world.

155
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:36,964
- You're not sitting there thinking, "Oh, fuck"?
- No, I'm not.

156
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,842
- You know I got you.
- You got me?

157
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:44,096
No doubt.

158
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,640
Come here.

159
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,231
Oh, fuck.

160
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,240
What up, D Roc?
Yo, what up, son?

161
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,785
You okay?

162
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,037
Yeah, I'm all right.

163
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,166
Let's get this money then.

164
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,504
Me and D Roc were like factory workers,

165
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,715
and Fulton Street was the assembly line.

166
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:26,054
♪ Here we go ♪

167
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:30,809
But every now and then,
D Roc would say, "Yo, can I get a rhyme?"

168
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,646
See, drug dealing was like my wife.

169
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,815
Rapping was just
some chick on the side.

170
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,444
Before I knew it,
word got out about my skills and shit.

171
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,571
Then this kid named Primo called me out.

172
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,116
Everyone was jocking him,
'cause he never lost a battle.

173
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:49,745
It was one thing to rhyme for your boys,
but it was another to battle.

174
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:55,083
- 'Bout time you stopped running.
- 'Bout time your ass stopped talking shit.

175
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,713
Yeah. That's Chris.
Come on, man.

176
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,548
Get out of here. Y'all got big

177

Y'all wanna see me and big boy?

178
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:07,304

That's what MC Quest.

179
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,681
Come on, man.

180
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,642
Hey, deejay,

181
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,685
All right. Do it.

182
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,250
I'm gonna get some barbecue
chicken when I'm done with big boy.

183
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,440

Primo. Who the hell is that?

217
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:54,369
Word!

218
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,582
What's up, Mom Dukes?

219
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:06,381
So I was by Fulton Records and I thought,
"What would make Slim happy?"

220
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,385
So I bought you
the corniest country album I could find.

221
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:17,017
In the last month,
you have missed 20 days of school.

222
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,564
All right. Look.
I tried, Ma.

223
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,817
I missed a few days.
But I went back three weeks straight.

224
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:30,197
Then three people came to my class on career day:
a computer technician, a store owner, a doctor,

225
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:34,284
- and they all looked like poor,
broke-down niggas.
- You watch your mouth.

226
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,789
I can't see myself going to school to end up like
them, 'cause I got something to do right now.

227
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,582
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

228
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,210
Jan's pregnant. I'm gonna be a father.

229
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:52,344
Please tell me
that you are not that stupid.

230
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,721
Why would you even say
something like that?

231
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,557
Because you are still a damn boy.

232
00:16:57,642 --> 00:17:00,102
Is this why you think
I came to the States

233
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:04,356
So I can spend all my days
taking care of you, feeding you?

234
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:08,902
- Cleaning up old plates of mashed potatoes
you leave under your bed?
- What?

235
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,948
- You can't take care of yourself.
How are you gonna take care of a baby?
- What did you do with it?

236
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,201
- Where's the plate?
- I threw it in the trash. It was disgusting.

237
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,413
It's my work, man.

238
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:23,166
- What are you doing?
- Those wasn't no damn mashed potatoes, all right?

239
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:30,006
Look at me.
I said, "Look at me."

240
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,512
Are you telling me
what I think you're telling me?

241
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:44,813
Boy, you gonna end up like those
worthless bums you hang with.

242
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:49,276
Don't you see that? Bums don't have chains,
and boys don't have money. I'm a man.

243
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:56,158
You think that makes you a man?

244
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,828
Get out.

245
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,998

You got yourself
into this mess. You get yourself out.

301
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:39,547
That was the first time in my life I thought if
I was dead, my fucking problems would go away.

302
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:45,220
I started rhyming 'cause I was bored.
Plain and simple.

303
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:49,724
But then my frustrations turned into
rhymes, and those rhymes told my story.

Hey, what's going on?
Chris?

00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,077

00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,581
You know he a pop now, right?
Word! Are you a pop?

337
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,708
Yeah.
Yo, what you got, a boy or girl?

00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:24,128

00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,927
Hey, yo, Big. I hope you remember

- Hey, yo. Now that you out, what you gonna do?

344
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:45,692

Got a little shorty I gotta support,
you know what I'm saying?

346
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:51,364
But not being able to support her
felt like a whole other kind of jail.

Uh, y'all have a seat.

397
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:59,635
So my boy said
that you was digging the tape.

398
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,265
I know what you did
for Jodeci and Mary J.

What kind of story you trying to tell?

401
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:13,118
I guess I'm trying to tell a story about a average
nigga from Brooklyn. Know what I'm saying?

402
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:17,445
- Nigga gotta figure out that life shit.
- You still hustling?

403
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:22,700
So you don't get it twisted,
I'm not against making money.

404
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:26,287
My business is about the streets,
but my business ain't in the streets.

405
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:29,957
And I can't be building nothing around no
artist that can get locked up any minute.

406
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,919
I'm saying, if you got real paper
coming my way, I'm out the game.

407
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:35,171
Don't chase the paper.
Chase the dream!

408
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:39,425
I started off as Andre Harrell's assistant.
Now I'm damn near running this place.

409
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:44,722
Nigga, I'm hungry! You can throw me butt-naked
in the jungle, and I'll come out with a

410
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:49,185
with a chinchilla coat, a leopard hat and
10 pounds heavier from eating them niggas.

411
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:53,731
- With all due respect, Puff, dreams ain't paying the bills, G.
- His do.

412
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:56,400
Puffy, I don't know about a chinchilla,

413
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:59,570
but if you throw me out to the jungle,
I'll have them motherfuckers dancing.

414
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:07,537
Maybe in the right hands,
I could be, like, one of the greatest.

415
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:10,456
Hmm.

416
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:13,960
- How old are you?
- Nineteen.

417
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,879
By the time you 21,
I'll make you into a millionaire.

418
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,592
We can change the world, Biggie Smalls.
We can change this game.

419
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:25,513
Saying the West Coast They got
Snoop, they got Dre, they got Cube.

420
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:29,725
They killing it. The East Coast just
waitin' for somebody to fill that void.

421
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,686
The decision is yours.

422
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,570
You can be the average nigga from Brooklyn or you
can rap about the average nigga from Brooklyn.

423
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:38,568
You gotta let me know
whether it's the streets or the studio.

424
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,870
So you in?

425
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:08,598
What's up, big mama?

426
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,101
What'd you just call me?

427
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,313
Big mama.

428
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,442
You looking damn good.
How's work today?

429
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:22,320
Every day you ask me how I'm doing.
What's that about?

430
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:26,490
- It's 'cause I care. Know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, right.

431
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,492
Whatever you say, big poppa.

432
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,494
You got a smart-ass mouth.

433
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,580
You gonna do something about it?

434
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,671
I ain't think so.

435
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,590
Hold up.

436
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,055
You wanna get something to eat?

437
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,478
Fuck. Oh, I like it.

438
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,356
Oh, shit, Big.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

439
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:03,277
Oh, damn.
I want you to get on top of me, Big.

440
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,321
Mm-mmm.
Oh.

441

444
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:26,008
Kind of late to be asking.

445
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,308
Well, I was seeing someone.

446
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,979
He kept thinkin'
we was in a Mike Tyson fight.

447
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:44,735
Ain't nobody gonna hurt you no more.
I got you, all right?

448
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:57,456
Oh, shit.
We got Puff out, huh?

449
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:00,001
Been out here waiting for y'all asses.

450
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,629
What's up, man?

451
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:05,715
- What's up, Big?
- What's up?

452
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:11,220
Andre said there only can be
one lion in the jungle.

453
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,599
The fuck you talking 'bout?

454
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,603
I got fired, Big.

455
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,856
So what about my deal?

456
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:26,777
You really had my ass goin'.

457
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,863
Just didn't know
it was all fucking bullshit.

458
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:32,950
Only thing I got lined up is some
some college shows.

459
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:36,954
It's gonna be a minute
before I get something real.

460
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,831
Hey, Big.

461
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:43,252
My father died hustling on these streets
when I was two years old.

462
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:46,797
Ain't no future in this right here.

463
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:51,093
Just because we got knocked down,
don't mean we can't get back up.

464
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:56,265
What don't break a nigga
make a nigga.

465
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,709
I thought I had a record deal, and now I
can't even buy fuckin' diapers for T'yanna.

466
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:25,669
Gotta punch the clock and shit.

467
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:28,798
I thought you told Puff you gonna
stop hustling, man. I thought I was.

468
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:39,058
- Oh, shit.
- Shit!

469
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,644
Yo, toss that! Toss that!

470
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:58,410
- We got another one.
He's heading to Saint Mark's.

471
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,622
There's nowhere to go.

472
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:05,417
Let's do this the easy way, huh?

473
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:09,839
- Show me your hands.
Come on, show me your hands.

474
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:13,300
You show me your hands,
I'll put the piece away.

475
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,352
You know, when I was a kid,

476
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:26,981
you had a switchblade, brass knuckles,
you were a bad dude.

477
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:31,569
Now you got 13-year-olds looking to shoot the big niggers
on the corner so they could start running shit themselves.

478
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:35,990
I mean, what the fuck is the world coming to when
a drug dealer can't walk the streets at night?

479
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,618
Tell me, Chris,
what do you put on first?

480
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:44,206
- Your socks, your jacket, your piece?
- I ain't never saw that gun before.

481
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:49,211
- So then it must be yours.
- Nah.

482
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:51,714
Okay, dumb fucks,

483
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:55,634
one of you is goin' down
for carrying an illegal firearm.

484
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,386
Whichever one it is,
I don't give a shit.

485
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,806
But there's no way that the two of you
are walkin' out of here.

486
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,231
I give you one minute.

487
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:18,407
He just trying to make us sweat. Yo, we play
hardball with him, he's gonna dust it for prints.

488
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,413
We'll cross that bridge when we get
there. No, by then it'll be too late.

489
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:27,541
Look, y-you got priors.
You're looking at five or six years, easy.

490
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:32,755
If I plead guilty, I get three and a day.

491
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:36,050
- No, D Roc. My gun, my bid.
- No, man. That's bullshit.

492
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:42,306
Look, this music shit you got going on
It don't come around every fuckin' day.

493
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,935
When a motherfucker like you make it,
we all make it.

494
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:49,980
What if I don't make it?
Listen.

495
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:53,025
I told you
how to get into the drug game.

496
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,861
Now I'm telling you
how to get the fuck out.

497
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:58,489
You don't have a record deal?
Then go out and get one.

498
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,491
But you're not going back on the block.

499
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,827
Not when you got the skills
to do something,

500
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:06,288
and not if I take this bid
for your ass.

501
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,750
So you're gonna make it.

502
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,801
So?

503
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,181
I put my socks on first,
motherfucker.

504
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,478
Okay.

505
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:34,483
Go ahead. Take a walk.

506
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,588
Big, what's going on?
You good?

507
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:59,591
Look, Mark, I'm gonna be for real
about this shit.

508
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:03,178
This is my motherfucking life,
you feel me? I got a kid.

509
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:05,681
I feel like I'm stuck in the mud, yo.

510
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,683
Tell Puff I'm down
with chasing the dream.

511
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,019
Whatever he want me to do, I'm in.
But this shit gotta jump off now.

512
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:13,731
I'm gonna tell Puff.
Look, I got you.

Puff will be right with you.

even have a job himself. It's not even like that.

Yes, ma'am. Uh

636
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:14,753
Your son has something special.

637
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:19,716
And sometimes it's gonna mean late nights and
hard work, but I think it's gonna pay off.

638
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:25,972
Now, the minute I see him slacking,
I'll be the first to let you know.

639
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:32,729
I been talking to Mark
about becoming my manager.

640
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,691
Good.

641
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:41,613
And if you're asking me to hold you equally
responsible, Mark believe me, I will.

642
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:44,074
Yes, ma'am.

643
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:48,411
- I need to have a word with Chris.
- Yes, ma'am.

644
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:07,013
My doctor found a lump
in my chest.

645
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:10,475
What?

646
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:15,230
My surgery is next week. They need to act
aggressively if I'm gonna have a chance.

647
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:19,651
- "If"? What is that supposed to mean?
- I want to be up front with you, Christopher.

648
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,112
No, Ma. No, I don't want to
hear all that. No, listen.

649
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:26,074
I need you to know something. Christopher!
Please! I don't want to hear this, Ma.

650
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,543
Listen, yo.
I got these ideas in my head.

I-I can't get Whoo!

652
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:43,633
L- Look, look, yo. I've been thinkin'
about my cousin Wayne. He's smart.

653
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:46,344
I been thinking about bringing him in
to help me with the management.

654
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:48,680
I think you'll dig him, Big.

655
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:53,768
Yo.

656
00:46:55,354 --> 00:47:00,066

Do you want to talk about it?

657
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:03,069
About what?
I mean, whatever's buggin' you, Big.

658
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:06,364
You haven't said shit
for the past couple days, man.

659
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:09,784
My moms has breast cancer.
Talkin' gonna fix that?

660
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,458
Shit.

661
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:20,587
No. I guess not.

662
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,509
I was only 15
when I lost my moms to cancer.

663

How'd you deal with shit?

664
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:34,184
I ain't feel like talking.

665
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:42,192
Look, Big, I know you goin'
through hard times right now.

666
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:46,613
But you're gonna have to be

864
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:40,469

867
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:49,687
What were you doing before

868

know how it is. Typical.

869
01:00:55,527 --> 01:01:01,490
So, are you a bad guy trying to be good,
or a good guy trying to be bad?

870
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:03,534
I'm someone trying to make it.

871

How'd you start singing?
North Baptist Church choir.

872

Typical.

873
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:14,003
I wrote a couple joints for other
artists and finally I got my shot.

874
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:19,133
I don't know what I'd be doing,
but I ain't think I'd be doing this.

875
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:22,219
When I was a little girl, everybody
told me singing was my destiny,

876
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:25,097
but I was secretly hoping to make
a career at doing the beat box.

877
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:28,893
No! Get out of here. I know you ain't

1024
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:14,751
For you to spend time
with your daughter.

1025
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:18,588
I do spend time with my daughter,
whenever I can.

1026
01:10:18,673 --> 01:10:21,299
I'm breaking Jan off
every motherfucking week with cash.

1027
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:24,469
- Giving money ain't the same thing.
- Whose side are you on?

1028
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:26,847
- You have to ask?
- My bad.

1029
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:28,640
So check it.

1030
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:32,084
Mark met some chick, so I may let them use
my suite tonight, so don't bother calling.

1031
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:37,774
You're letting Mark use your room?

1032
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:40,193
Yeah, it ain't no thing.

1033
01:10:40,278 --> 01:10:42,904
It sounds stupid, that's all.

1034
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:45,991
That's 'cause it is stupid.
But it's for my man, you know?

1035
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:52,956
- All right. I love you.
- I love you, too, Fay.

1036
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:05,969
Hello? Hi. Could you
watch Chyna for me?

1037
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:20,734
Yes?

1038
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:23,612
Housekeeping.
No, thank you.

1039
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:28,200
Sorry, ma'am.
I can't hear you through the door.

1040
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:31,161
I said, no, thank you

1041
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:32,829
- Shit!
- What the fuck?

1042
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:34,289
- Fay, wait. Fay.
- What the fuck?

1043
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:36,499
Fay, wait! Don't!

What's up? Looking good, baby.
How you doing? How's everything?

Everything good.
Good to see you.

- Here, you break.
- Oh, you want some of this?

Yo, Pac, can I get your autograph?

1152
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:31,164
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1153

This shit ever trip you out?

1154

What? People wanting your autograph.
They actin' like it's 14 karats.

1155
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:43,718
I had a kid come to me the other day,
tell me I was his hero.

1156
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:47,680
But, I'm like, nah. Malcolm X
should be your hero. Dr. King.

1157
01:18:47,765 --> 01:18:49,265
That was Pac.

1158
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:53,603
A revolutionary one minute,
a thug-life motherfucker the next.

1159
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:56,939
Ask 10 people who Pac is
and you get 10 different answers.

1160
01:18:57,024 --> 01:18:59,317
But he was all that and more,

1161
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:04,280
and sometimes he was just someone
who liked to fuck with you.

1162
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:07,700
- Give me your money. Take your little lunch money.
- Huh!

1163
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:13,247
But like Pac told me, the best time
would be when I was coming up.

1164
01:19:13,332 --> 01:19:16,084
Because once you on top,
you can only go down.

1165
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:17,835
What's up, Dre?

1166
01:19:17,961 --> 01:19:22,090
Pac was right. That night at Quad Studios
changed everything.

1167
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:36,437
Hey, yo! What's up, Pac?

1168
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:39,899
- Hey! What up, Cease?
- You coming up?

1169
01:19:39,983 --> 01:19:43,403
- Yeah, I got a gig on the 12th floor.
- All right. I'm gonna go tell Big.

1170
01:19:43,487 --> 01:19:45,488
Yeah!

1171
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:52,495
Hey, yo, Big.
I just saw your boy Pac downstairs.

1172
01:19:52,579 --> 01:19:54,539
Yeah?
Go get him.

1173
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,999
All right.

1174
01:19:57,126 --> 01:20:00,336
You know Big and them on the 10th floor. They
in a session. Yeah? How their session going?

1175
01:20:00,421 --> 01:20:02,338
Come on, man.
You know he doing his thing.

1176
01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:05,263
Just make sure they're working.
We gotta make sure this paper's flowing.

1177
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:08,761
Yo, I hope Pac got some
of that good weed, man.

1178
01:20:08,846 --> 01:20:12,223
They say, "Puff, puff, pass." But if
it's that good, I ain't passing nothing.

1179
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:26,414
- Yo, get those motherfuckers back in the elevator!
- Get the fuck back in the elevator, man!

1180
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:32,827
Yo, Big, man! Pac is downstairs getting
rolled on, man! They had the gun in my face!

1181
01:20:32,953 --> 01:20:36,122
Don't move. Stay here. They're still
down there. Let me come with you, man!

1182
01:20:41,378 --> 01:20:43,296
Fuck! Press 12.

1183
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,882
Press 12!

1184
01:20:46,884 --> 01:20:48,968
Oh, fuck!

1185
01:20:57,227 --> 01:20:59,020
Motherfucker jacked me
in the lobby, man!

1186
01:20:59,104 --> 01:21:00,188
Pac!

1187
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:06,152
Stop right there!

1188
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:09,030
Hold on. Shut the fuck up and
keep your hands in the air!

1189
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:12,158
Yo, somebody call the ambulance.
Yo, Pac. What happened, Pac?

1190
01:21:12,242 --> 01:21:14,660
Tupac didn't know
who the fuck to trust.

1191
01:21:14,745 --> 01:21:17,121
Get away from me.

1192
01:21:18,498 --> 01:21:22,335
Which one of y'all set me up?
I'm right here, motherfucker!

1193
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:24,462
What? Huh? Fuck!

1194
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:27,423
As far as he was concerned
Oh, shit.

1195
01:21:27,507 --> 01:21:29,342
Everyone near was responsible,

1196
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:31,469
Oh, shit. Fuck y'all, man!

1197
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:34,055
Including me.

1198
01:21:36,099 --> 01:21:39,518
In the aftermath of the Tupac Shakur
shooting at Quad Studios...

1199
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:42,855
the rapper-actor named
record producer Sean "Puffy" Combs

1200
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:45,983
What? No!
This is full of shit.

1201
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:50,321
Yo, Big, come on, man. You don't
need to be watching this right now.

1202
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:52,323
I warned him about those guys.

1203
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:55,868
Naming music producer Sean "Puffy" Combs
and the rapper Christopher Wallace...

1204
01:21:55,953 --> 01:21:59,330
Now he's blaming me? How the fuck
could he say I'd do some shit like that?

1205
01:21:59,456 --> 01:22:03,876
Yeah, they're full of it, man. They wouldn't
even let me see him in the hospital.

1206
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:06,170
Fuck it!
I'm gonna call him.

1207
01:22:06,296 --> 01:22:09,048
He know who shot him.
Yo, Big, hold up.

1208
01:22:09,132 --> 01:22:11,175
Yo, Big, hold up.
Big!

1209
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:14,512
Yo, Big, ho Big, hold up.
Hey, Big, hold up, man.

1210
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:18,307
They just found your man
guilty on that sex abuse.

1211
01:22:18,392 --> 01:22:21,894
He ain't thinking clearly right now.
You know what I'm saying?

1212
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:26,065
Just give him some time. Just give
him some time, let this cool down.

1213
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:28,150
Shit doesn't make any sense.

1214
01:22:28,235 --> 01:22:30,653
At the Superior Court
where he faced a jury...

1215
01:22:30,737 --> 01:22:33,656
in the sex-abuse trial
brought against him last year.

1216
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:36,993
He was acquitted of six counts in the
indictment and found guilty of three others.

1217
01:22:37,077 --> 01:22:39,578
He now faces sentencing
and probable jail time.

1218
01:22:39,705 --> 01:22:43,624
Hey, yo, check this out.
Let me tell y'all who the winner is.

1219
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:46,419
And the winner is...

1220
01:22:46,503 --> 01:22:49,755
Above the backboards and the rims.
You know what I'm saying?

1221
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,758
Pac went to jail
on the sex-abuse charge.

1222
01:22:52,843 --> 01:22:55,761
We thought all the bullshit
would die down,

1223
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:59,849
but Suge Knight, the owner of Death
Row Records, had something else in mind.

1224
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:03,978
I'd like to tell Tupac to keep his
guards up. We riding with him.

1225
01:23:04,062 --> 01:23:06,355
And one other thing I'd like to say.

1226
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:12,153
Any artists out there that want
to be artists and want to stay a star...

1227
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:16,449
and don't... don't have to worry
about the executive producer...

1228
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:23,831
all up in the videos, all
on the records, dancin',

1229
01:23:23,915 --> 01:23:25,374
come to Death Row!

1230
01:23:29,087 --> 01:23:32,256
- Hell, yeah! West Side, boys!
- Yo, come on, man.

1231
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:36,135
Big, what is
the East Coast-West Coast rivalry?

1232
01:23:36,219 --> 01:23:39,680
Are you afraid for your life?

1233
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:43,642
- Any further comments on Death Row?
- Biggie, what did Puff Daddy do?

1234
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:45,644
Did you shoot Tupac?

1235
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:50,983
What are you going to do
now that Pac's getting out of jail?

1236
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:53,736
Go, go!
Get us the fuck out of here!

1237
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:57,823
Pac and his people have been saying that "Who
Shot Ya?" the joint Biggie came out with,

1238
01:23:57,908 --> 01:24:01,118
is trying to dis Pac about
the shooting at Quad Studios.

1239
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:03,788
But Biggie's camp is saying he wrote that
song before the shooting ever happened.

1240
01:24:03,914 --> 01:24:06,624
And he stopped playing that song now.
Yeah, he stopped playing the song.

1241
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:09,710
And now Pac is coming out with this new song getting
at Biggie. The whole thing is getting out of control.

1242
01:24:09,836 --> 01:24:12,156
The fans are choosing sides,
the labels are choosing sides.

1243
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:16,467
What's up?

1244
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:20,304
What? You're just gonna
sit there looking stupid?

1245
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:22,807
- Yo, your boy's been wilding out, man.
- Who?

1246
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:27,937
Pac. He's been on a mission
ever since Suge bailed him out of jail.

Big, I'm doing an interview.
When were you going to tell me?

1264
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:26,203
I gotta find out about it like this?
You fucked that motherfucker? Huh?

1265
01:25:26,329 --> 01:25:28,247
Come the fuck here.

1266
01:25:28,331 --> 01:25:31,417
Get the fuck over here.
Let me talk to you.

1267
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:34,044
You fucked that motherfucker?
Huh?

1268
01:25:34,171 --> 01:25:37,923
You want to fuck with niggas? You want
to fuck with niggas? Huh? Get out of here!

1269
01:25:38,008 --> 01:25:41,844
Yo, Big, go downstairs, man. You
know somebody called security by now!

1270
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:44,221
Big, get the hell out!

1271
01:25:44,306 --> 01:25:46,223
Get the hell out, man!

1272
01:25:46,308 --> 01:25:48,767
- What were you thinkin'?
- I wasn't fuckin' thinking.

1273
01:25:48,852 --> 01:25:52,521
I just fucking snapped, all right?
I just wanted to get the truth.

1274
01:25:52,606 --> 01:25:56,192
Yo, man, truth is your Pac, he trying
to bring you down to the gutter with him,

1275
01:25:56,276 --> 01:25:58,194
and you playing
right into his hands, Big.

1276
01:25:58,278 --> 01:26:00,571
I mean, well, we can squabble,

1277
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:04,783
but, yo, I just got finished signing
with Clive for $42 million.

1278
01:26:04,868 --> 01:26:08,871
And you getting $5 million, Big.
Don't mess that up.

1279
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:28,891
Fay-Fay? Come on, FEW, open
the door. I want to talk to you.

1280
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:32,144
Come on, open the door.
Please.

1281
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:34,230
Fay.

1282
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:39,235
Can you open the door?

1283
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:41,320
Fay!

1284
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:51,956
What's going on?

1285
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,083
Fuck you!

1286
01:26:55,168 --> 01:26:58,546
I don't even know
who the fuck you are anymore.

1287
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:00,923
Can you listen for a minute?

1288
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:04,635
Fay, just listen to me for a minute.
It's over.

1289
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:08,931
I'm sorry about bugging the fuck out.
I'm sorry about a lot of things.

1290
01:27:09,015 --> 01:27:11,767
Why couldn't you just be a man
and ask me?

1291
01:27:13,103 --> 01:27:17,231
Okay, I'm asking.
What happened with you and Pac?

1292
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:21,694
I saw him at the House of Blues.

1293
01:27:21,778 --> 01:27:24,905
We took that picture,
and that's all it was supposed to be.

1294
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:27,283
And that's all there was.

1295
01:27:27,367 --> 01:27:29,118
End of story.

1296
01:27:30,787 --> 01:27:34,707
Okay. Maybe now you have an idea
what it feels like to be cheated on.

1297
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:39,712
I'm not bragging, Fay, but I could have
had 10 bitches a day if I wanted.

1298
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:43,507
So go have 10, 20.
I don't give a fuck.

1299
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:47,636
I ain't mean that.

1300
01:27:55,228 --> 01:27:59,106
No, Chris.

1301
01:28:01,192 --> 01:28:03,485
I'm not laughing.

1302
01:28:04,654 --> 01:28:06,322
Not anymore.
Come on, Fay.

1303
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:26,175
Damn!

1304
01:28:27,927 --> 01:28:29,803
What?
This Notorious?

1305
01:28:29,929 --> 01:28:32,848
Yeah. You gonna be
wearing a toe tag, nigga.

1306
01:28:32,932 --> 01:28:35,559
Who this?
West Coast, motherfucker.

1307
01:28:37,729 --> 01:28:41,398
- What size are these?
- Those are 14s like you asked.

1308
01:28:41,483 --> 01:28:43,442
These ain't no fucking 14s.

1309
01:28:43,526 --> 01:28:46,320
Fucking 12s.
These ain't no fucking 14s.

1310
01:28:46,446 --> 01:28:48,864
All right, everybody out.
Cease, go get the car!

1311
01:28:48,948 --> 01:28:50,991
Everybody out!
All these fucking problems.

1312
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:53,786
Out, people. Come on. Come on.
Hey, Mark, y'all playing around.

1313
01:28:53,912 --> 01:28:56,330
You ain't doing your job! Y'all
sent over the wrong size shoes!

1314
01:28:56,414 --> 01:28:59,333
Y'all sent the wrong size shoes!
Now he ain't going on!

1315
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:01,627
I ain't got time
for no temper tantrum!

1316
01:29:01,711 --> 01:29:04,546
Look, you need to chill, Puff.
He's got a lot on his mind right now.

1317
01:29:04,631 --> 01:29:07,800
What? He stressed out about them
Death Row niggas in the audience?

1318
01:29:07,884 --> 01:29:11,261
Big ain't worried about it.
It ain't that, man. Fay's pregnant.

1319
01:29:11,346 --> 01:29:14,264
How'd that knucklehead get her
pregnant? I thought they was broke up.

1320
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:16,725
All this soap opera drama.
Yo, Big!

1321
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:19,645
I'm not going on. Big, come
on, man. Don't do this to me.

1322
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:24,400
Don't do this to yourself! I've done just about
every fucking thing you have ever asked of me.

1323
01:29:24,484 --> 01:29:27,861
All I want in return
is some motherfucking shoes that fit.

1324
01:29:27,946 --> 01:29:30,280
Yo, man, yo, man.

1325
01:29:33,743 --> 01:29:36,245
There you go dancing again.
Yeah.

1326
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:44,086
- Maybe I take my shoes too seriously.
- Size 14, I would take them seriously.

1327
01:29:52,846 --> 01:29:55,347
I know lately that it ain't been easy.

1328
01:29:55,432 --> 01:29:57,349
Pac is talking about us.

1329
01:29:57,434 --> 01:30:01,603
The media is doing whatever they can to keep
this East Coast-West Coast thing going on.

1330
01:30:01,688 --> 01:30:04,690
I wanna be the last cat still standing.

1331
01:30:04,774 --> 01:30:07,776
I'm hoping
that you want the same thing.

1332
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:15,534
Yo, look, I just got these from Big Sexy.

1333
01:30:15,618 --> 01:30:18,620
They ain't fly or nothin',
but they gonna have to work, baby.

1334
01:30:18,705 --> 01:30:22,750
I used to sling rock for nice kicks.
Now look at me.

1335
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:27,004
This your idea
of us changing the world?

1336
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:30,591
We can't change the world
unless we change ourselves.

1337
01:30:38,558 --> 01:30:42,686
Yo, Big. What now, huh, motherfucker?
Huh? West Side, motherfucker!

1338
01:30:42,771 --> 01:30:46,690
Now you on the best side! What you gonna
do now, bitch? Huh? Huh, motherfucker?

1339
01:30:46,775 --> 01:30:49,443
- Let me talk to you, man.
- Your bitch ass set me up!

1340
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:52,988
What you gotta say now, motherfucker?
That's why I fucked your wife!

1341
01:30:53,072 --> 01:30:55,824
Oh! He got the strap!
He got the strap!

1342
01:30:55,909 --> 01:30:58,368
- You set me up, motherfucker!
- He got the strap.

1343
01:30:58,453 --> 01:30:59,912
Let's go!

1344
01:30:59,996 --> 01:31:03,499
- What the fuck? Come on, man! West Side, bitch!
- Catch you on the rebound, big boy.

1345
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:07,294
Me and Pac should have said,
"Fuck that bullshit.

1346
01:31:07,378 --> 01:31:09,630
Let's go somewhere
and talk this shit out."

1347
01:31:09,714 --> 01:31:12,841
But the fact is,
we were both way beyond that now.

1348
01:31:15,887 --> 01:31:17,805
The media went crazy.

1349
01:31:17,889 --> 01:31:22,684
It had nothing to do with hip-hop but everything
to do with selling papers and magazines.

1350
01:31:22,769 --> 01:31:25,562
- If it ain't New York, it ain't shit.
- West Side, Compton in the house!

1351
01:31:25,647 --> 01:31:28,440
- We got Biggie. We got everybody.
- We got Pac. We got Dre.

1352
01:31:28,525 --> 01:31:32,027
- Play our shit on the East Coast.
- None of that shit get played in the clubs in the Bronx.

1353
01:31:32,111 --> 01:31:34,363
We created all this rap shit anyway.
East Coast.

1354
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:38,700
West Side! They might think they started the
game, but we elevated that motherfucker.

1355
01:31:38,827 --> 01:31:43,539
Tupac knows what he's talking about. He talks about the hood.
He talks about what's actually going on on the streets.

1356
01:31:43,623 --> 01:31:48,001
I know Big set him up. That's why my
man Pac came back with "Hit 'Em Up."

1357
01:31:48,086 --> 01:31:50,087
That's some bullshit.
Set him up?

1358
01:31:50,171 --> 01:31:52,548
Biggie wrote "Who Shot Ya?" because
he got something to do with Pac.

1359
01:31:52,632 --> 01:31:55,312
Big wrote "Who Shot Ya?"
months before that shit went down with Pac.

1360
01:31:55,385 --> 01:31:59,805
How is Pac gonna really think
that Biggie would set him up like that?

1361
01:31:59,931 --> 01:32:03,767
- Fuck West Coast. Man, they can eat a motherfucking dick.
- I don't give a fuck if you think it's gangsta.

1362
01:32:03,852 --> 01:32:05,769
- Fuck Compton, man.
- Fuck the East Coast.
- Fuck the West Coast.

1363
01:32:05,854 --> 01:32:09,565
That's what the fuck I think about
the motherfucking East motherfucking Coast.

1383
01:33:22,388 --> 01:33:25,015

Pac warned me,
but I didn't believe him.

1387

This song was made months ago.

1388
01:33:36,903 --> 01:33:40,697
He probably won't believe me.
Maybe nobody will.

Headline news at the top of the hour.

1431
01:35:45,823 --> 01:35:49,117
Right now we've got some
breaking news for you out of Las Vegas.

1432
01:35:49,202 --> 01:35:52,704
An apparent drive-by shooting
targeting rapper-actor Tupac Shakur.

1433
01:35:52,789 --> 01:35:55,791
- Hey, yo, Big, come in here, man!
- At the time of the shooting

1434
01:35:55,875 --> 01:35:57,876
What the hell
you hollering about?

1435
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:01,129
Shakur was accompanied
by his producer, Suge Knight.

1436
01:36:01,214 --> 01:36:03,632
Police are not yet
indicating any suspects.

1437
01:36:03,716 --> 01:36:07,385
However, eyewitnesses reported
hearing multiple gunshots.

1438
01:36:07,512 --> 01:36:12,182
Shakur was airlifted to the Las Vegas University
Medical Center with four gunshot wounds...

1439
01:36:12,266 --> 01:36:14,434
and is reported to be
in critical condition.

1440
01:36:14,519 --> 01:36:15,519
What the fuck?

1441
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:54,891
I pray all this East Coast-West Coast
mess is over now.

1442
01:36:54,976 --> 01:36:58,061
I saw his mother on TV.

1443
01:36:58,145 --> 01:37:00,146
She's a strong woman.

1444
01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:04,818
But no parent
should have to bury their child.

1445
01:37:04,902 --> 01:37:08,446
I just always figured
we had time to straighten things out.

1446
01:37:08,531 --> 01:37:11,491
You don't think this had anything to do
with your argument?

1447
01:37:11,576 --> 01:37:13,910
No.

1448
01:37:13,995 --> 01:37:15,996
I don't.

1449
01:37:17,331 --> 01:37:20,208
Well, nobody is invincible, Son.

1450
01:37:21,544 --> 01:37:25,255
That's why we have to make
everything we do now count.

1451
01:37:26,591 --> 01:37:30,135
I'm chilling with my man Pac, who schooled me
to the game and shit. Know what I'm sayin'?

1452
01:37:30,219 --> 01:37:34,973
Now we about to wreak havoc on you
motherfuckers, man. Know what I'm sayin'?

1453
01:37:39,770 --> 01:37:42,731
I don't know
when the hell they'll fix your truck,

1454
01:37:42,815 --> 01:37:45,400
but I'll get us home before
we're seen in this piece of shit.

1455
01:37:45,484 --> 01:37:48,862
I don't care, Cease.
Just drive.

1456
01:37:52,074 --> 01:37:53,825
Watch out!

1457
01:37:55,953 --> 01:37:59,372
In that one moment,
I had that thought again.

1458
01:37:59,457 --> 01:38:03,001
Dying would be better
than dealing with this shit.

1459
01:38:03,085 --> 01:38:05,921
I was leaving, and I was sitting
in a hotel, and a voice said,

1460
01:38:06,005 --> 01:38:08,131
"Do you see any niggers?"

1461
01:38:08,215 --> 01:38:12,010
And I said, "No."
And it said, "You know why?
'Cause there aren't any."

1462
01:38:12,136 --> 01:38:15,180
Yeah, I been here three weeks,
I haven't even said it.

1463
01:38:15,264 --> 01:38:17,891
I ain't gonna never call
another black man nigger.

1464
01:38:17,975 --> 01:38:21,937
Look at you. Your mama should
have never let you out the house.

1465
01:38:22,063 --> 01:38:24,314
Oh, shit.

1466
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:26,858
I can't believe it.
Oh, bro, what's going on?

1467
01:38:26,943 --> 01:38:28,944
- When did you get out?
- Yesterday.

1468
01:38:29,028 --> 01:38:32,113
- You picked up some weight.
- Man, look who's talking.

1469
01:38:32,198 --> 01:38:34,282
Damn.

1470
01:38:34,367 --> 01:38:36,368
Wow.

1471
01:38:36,452 --> 01:38:39,788
Biggie motherfuckin' Smalls.
I'm proud of you, dog.

1472
01:38:39,872 --> 01:38:43,959
When the brothers in the pen found
out you was my boy, I got mad love.

1473
01:38:44,043 --> 01:38:46,294
Yeah?
How much love did you get?

1474
01:38:46,379 --> 01:38:48,171
Man, fuck you, bitch.

1475
01:38:49,382 --> 01:38:52,676
D Roc, there's not a day that don't go by
when I don't think about what you did for me.

1476
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:54,886
I set some paper aside for you.

1477
01:38:58,516 --> 01:39:00,433
I didn't do it for no pay off.

1478
01:39:00,518 --> 01:39:05,146
If shit was reversed, I don't know how
I could do that bid for you like that.

1479
01:39:05,231 --> 01:39:10,360
Well, if shit was reversed, I don't know if
I could have been strong enough to make it.

1480
01:39:10,444 --> 01:39:13,363
Making it?

1481
01:39:14,448 --> 01:39:16,992
It ain't all it's cracked up to be.

1482
01:39:17,076 --> 01:39:18,952
More money, more problems.

1483
01:39:19,036 --> 01:39:21,371
- Beats the corner.
- Guess so.

1484
01:39:22,665 --> 01:39:24,290
Hey, yo.

1485
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:27,627
Little D Roc was born
when I was locked up.

1486
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:31,798
Look at him, man.

1487
01:39:31,882 --> 01:39:35,135
I'm just gettin' to know him
and shit.

1488
01:39:36,345 --> 01:39:38,555
So how's Tee-Tee doing, huh?

1489
01:39:40,766 --> 01:39:42,934
Okay. I guess.

1490
01:39:50,026 --> 01:39:53,319
I'm gonna check you out
a little later on, all right?

1491
01:39:55,156 --> 01:40:00,744
You know, neither one of us had our
fathers around to teach us how to be men.

1492
01:40:00,828 --> 01:40:03,830
We were just learning
as we was going along.

1493
01:40:06,917 --> 01:40:10,795
But maybe making it
ain't just about the shit you do onstage.

1494
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,131
You a philosopher now?

1495
01:40:15,301 --> 01:40:19,262
Man, I think everyone that's in the pen
is a philosopher.

1496
01:40:19,346 --> 01:40:23,850
But when you're on your back,
laying on that cot...

1497
01:40:23,934 --> 01:40:27,145
you spend a lot of time
staring at the ceiling,

1498
01:40:27,229 --> 01:40:29,230
looking for God,

1499
01:40:30,608 --> 01:40:33,234
thinking about what's important.

1500
01:40:34,278 --> 01:40:36,196
Keep making it, Chris.

1501
01:40:55,549 --> 01:40:58,259
You gotta let me know
whether it's the streets or the studio.

1502
01:40:58,344 --> 01:41:00,804
You got me?

1503
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:04,891
You think that makes you a man?

1504
01:41:04,975 --> 01:41:07,727
You be a great father.

1505
01:41:07,812 --> 01:41:10,105
What if I don't make it?

1506
01:41:10,189 --> 01:41:13,483
I love you too.

1507
01:41:13,567 --> 01:41:16,945
We gonna be all right,
just you and me.

1508
01:41:17,029 --> 01:41:18,780
You're too fat, black, and ugly.

1509
01:41:18,864 --> 01:41:21,491
I don't even know
who the fuck you are anymore.

1510
01:41:22,576 --> 01:41:25,912
Are you a bad guy trying to be good,
or a good guy trying to be bad?

1511
01:41:46,350 --> 01:41:49,519
And I want you to know

1512
01:41:49,603 --> 01:41:54,023
That these are the breaks

1513
01:41:54,108 --> 01:41:56,526
Break it up, break it up, break it up

1514
01:41:58,988 --> 01:42:01,406
Now go play.
That's my girl.

1515
01:42:08,455 --> 01:42:11,457
- Hello?
- Hey. What you doing?

1516
01:42:11,542 --> 01:42:14,419
- I'm just kicking it with my daughter.
- How's the leg?

1517
01:42:14,503 --> 01:42:16,379
It's all right.

1518
01:42:16,463 --> 01:42:20,842
- I got one more stop, and then I'm on my way.
You need anything? - That's not a good idea.

1519
01:42:22,595 --> 01:42:25,638
- What isn't?
- I'm just here kicking it with my daughter.

1520
01:42:25,723 --> 01:42:29,517
- You were the one who told me to come over.
- I'll call you later.

1521
01:42:31,645 --> 01:42:34,731
I'm done with this.
I'm sick of you treating me like shit.

1522
01:42:34,815 --> 01:42:38,610
You know what, nigga? Don't even
bother calling. All right? Fuck you.

1523
01:42:38,694 --> 01:42:40,403
Fuck you too, bitch.

1524
01:42:47,912 --> 01:42:49,913
Come here, Tee-Tee.

1525
01:42:56,962 --> 01:43:00,131
I'm gonna teach you something
I never want you to forget.

1526
01:43:00,216 --> 01:43:02,133
Another rap?

1527
01:43:02,218 --> 01:43:06,471
No. More important
than any rap song.

1528
01:43:06,555 --> 01:43:08,973
Look at me.

1529
01:43:09,058 --> 01:43:11,392
See, you're my princess.

1530
01:43:11,477 --> 01:43:15,772
So no matter what, for any reason,

1531
01:43:15,856 --> 01:43:18,441
never let a man call you a bitch.

1532
01:43:18,567 --> 01:43:21,069
You got it?
Yes, Daddy.

1533
01:43:21,195 --> 01:43:23,571
You sure you got it? You
better have it, you hear? Yes.

1534
01:43:34,792 --> 01:43:38,002
Hey, yo, isn't that Sandy?

1535
01:43:38,087 --> 01:43:41,089
Yo, she used to be a crackhead.

1536
01:43:59,191 --> 01:44:02,151
People dying for that
next Biggie Smalls joint.

1537
01:44:02,236 --> 01:44:05,989
Tell me the reason why you're here 'cause
you ready to get back in the studio.

1538
01:44:06,073 --> 01:44:09,867
I think I am, Puff, but there's a couple
of things I wanna talk to you about.

1539
01:44:11,745 --> 01:44:13,746
What's on your mind, Big?

1540
01:44:14,999 --> 01:44:17,792
I can't talk about
the same shit anymore.

1541
01:44:17,876 --> 01:44:21,087
A motherfucker's a work in progress.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1542
01:44:21,171 --> 01:44:23,631
But I ain't hustling
on the streets no more.

1543
01:44:23,716 --> 01:44:29,679
I got two kids. Half the time
I don't even feel like the same cat.

1544
01:44:31,849 --> 01:44:33,766
I wanna do something different.

1545
01:44:33,851 --> 01:44:37,395
So if it's cool
to try some new shit,

1546
01:44:37,479 --> 01:44:39,230
I'm ready to come back.

1547
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:48,489
Yeah.

1548
01:44:48,574 --> 01:44:50,783
What?
The Notorious baby... What?

1549
01:44:50,868 --> 01:44:53,036
Uh-huh. You ready? Yeah, yeah.

1550
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:56,456
Ready to run the world? Ready
to take it? Ain't trippin'.

1551
01:44:56,582 --> 01:45:00,793
I don't see nobody. What's up? I'm walking
around, don't see nobody. You know how we do it.

1552
01:45:00,878 --> 01:45:04,297
All right.
That's what I'm talking about.

1553
01:45:04,423 --> 01:45:06,632

I did it.

Yo, Big, wake up.
Wake up, baby.

1577
01:46:19,957 --> 01:46:22,834
We got the 7:30 flight 504.
504.

1578
01:46:22,918 --> 01:46:25,753
Going to L.A.X.
Cali?

1579
01:46:25,838 --> 01:46:29,423
No doubt, baby. California.
Yeah.

1580
01:46:29,508 --> 01:46:31,968
I don't like you going out there.

1581
01:46:32,052 --> 01:46:35,346
I think me being in L.A.
is gonna finally put an end to all of this.

1582
01:46:35,430 --> 01:46:39,058
Besides, I'm just promoting the album.
I'll be home soon.

1583
01:46:39,143 --> 01:46:41,644
Mmm.

1584
01:46:42,646 --> 01:46:45,398
Hey, Ma. I'm proud of you.

1585
01:46:47,025 --> 01:46:50,570
Proud of me? For what?

1586
01:46:50,654 --> 01:46:54,615
Fighting cancer, then getting
your master's, sticking with it,

1587
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:56,742
even with everything
you've been through.

1588
01:47:01,707 --> 01:47:03,708
Thank you.

1589
01:47:07,212 --> 01:47:11,132
I want you to be careful,
Chrissy-poo.

1590
01:47:11,216 --> 01:47:13,968
I hate it when you call me that.

1591
01:47:14,052 --> 01:47:19,724
I forgot.
You're all grown-up now.

1592
01:47:21,226 --> 01:47:24,645
West Coast rappers were still scared
to come to the East Coast,

1593
01:47:24,730 --> 01:47:27,190
and East Coast rappers
were scared to come out west,

1594
01:47:27,274 --> 01:47:30,443
but it was time
to put an end to all this shit.

1595
01:47:30,527 --> 01:47:32,945
So I went to Cali
to promote my album.

1596
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:36,199
Y'all see how sexy I looked last night
at the Soul Train Awards?

1597
01:47:36,283 --> 01:47:40,119
- Yeah. We saw you.
- I gotta stay out here and promote the album.

1598
01:47:40,204 --> 01:47:42,246
You think T'yanna could come out?

1599
01:47:43,582 --> 01:47:46,250
Maybe my moms could bring her?

1600
01:47:47,753 --> 01:47:49,754
Um

1601
01:47:51,506 --> 01:47:54,050
Okay.

1602
01:47:54,134 --> 01:47:56,719
I wouldn't have a problem with that.

1603
01:47:58,722 --> 01:48:00,681
Thanks, man.
These shits are hot!

Hip-hop royalty from both coasts
are out on the town here in L.A. tonight.

1616
01:49:12,754 --> 01:49:16,757

1617
01:49:16,842 --> 01:49:19,802

1645

Let's change the world, Big.

1646
01:51:08,954 --> 01:51:11,956
Can't change the world
unless we change ourselves.

1647
01:51:14,126 --> 01:51:18,712
I think all my life
I was trying to become a man,

1648
01:51:18,797 --> 01:51:24,468
but for some reason on this night
I didn't have to try anymore.

1649
01:51:28,390 --> 01:51:32,643
My second album was about to drop,

1650
01:51:32,727 --> 01:51:37,773
and it felt like God was giving me
a clean slate all over again.

1651
01:51:37,858 --> 01:51:43,028
Unfortunately, we being shut down.
We done burn it up in here tonight.

1652
01:51:43,113 --> 01:51:45,823
Fire marshal's in the house
and we got to go.

1653
01:51:45,907 --> 01:51:48,576
Please exit to the far left.

1654
01:51:48,660 --> 01:51:51,662
We should just chill.
Let them clear out first, all right?

1655
01:52:05,468 --> 01:52:07,720
You're the man.
Everybody love you right now, son.

1656
01:52:07,804 --> 01:52:10,848
Yo, look.
We got shit to do in the morning.

1657
01:52:10,974 --> 01:52:13,475

What's up?

1659
01:52:23,945 --> 01:52:26,363
I just wanted to say sorry and shit.

1660
01:52:26,489 --> 01:52:31,285
When I get back to New York, why don't we just
sit down and figure out what the fuck we doing?

1661
01:52:31,369 --> 01:52:33,621
No more drama.

1662
01:52:33,705 --> 01:52:35,706
We could do that.

told stories.

1713
01:58:59,382 --> 01:59:03,427
Some of them were funny,
some of them were sad,

some of them were violent,

01:59:09,392 --> 01:59:14,980

was cut down at the age of 24,

1717
01:59:15,064 --> 01:59:20,819
but I find solace
in knowing that he became a man...

1718
01:59:20,903 --> 01:59:23,614
and he was ready to live.

1719
