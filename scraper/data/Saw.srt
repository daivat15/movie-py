1
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,418
Help! Someone help me!

2
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,756
Is someone there?

3
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:42,884
Hey!

4
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,221
Oh, shit, I'm probably dead.

5
00:01:47,305 --> 00:01:50,015
You're not dead.
-Who's that?

6
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,101
Who's that?

7
00:01:52,185 --> 00:01:54,895
There's no point in yelling,
I already tried that.

8
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:57,231
Turn on the lights!

9
00:01:57,315 --> 00:01:59,525
I would if I could.

10
00:01:59,608 --> 00:02:02,902
What the fuck is going on?
Where am I?

11
00:02:02,986 --> 00:02:06,531
-I don't know yet.
-What is that smell?

12
00:02:06,615 --> 00:02:10,785
Shh. Hang on a second.
I think I found something.

13
00:02:57,704 --> 00:02:59,079
Holy shit.

14
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,762
Aaaargh! Help!

15
00:03:19,056 --> 00:03:20,599
Help!

16
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:24,144
Help!

17
00:03:25,396 --> 00:03:26,813
Help!

18
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,941
No-one can hear you.

19
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:32,234
What the fuck is this?

20
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,988
Calm down. Just calm down.

21
00:03:36,072 --> 00:03:37,281
Are you hurt?

22
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,701
I don't know. Yeah!

23
00:03:40,784 --> 00:03:44,412
-What's your name?
-My name is Very Fucking Confused.

24
00:03:44,496 --> 00:03:47,123
What's your name?
What's going on here?

25
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:51,169
My name is Lawrence Gordon, I'm a doctor.
I just woke up here, like you.

26
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,346
Aaaargh!

27
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:05,974
Recognize him?

28
00:04:06,059 --> 00:04:07,684
No.

29
00:04:10,562 --> 00:04:12,605
Do you have any idea how you got here?

30
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:14,440
No.

31
00:04:14,524 --> 00:04:17,401
-What's the last thing you remember?
-Nothing.

32
00:04:17,486 --> 00:04:21,864
I went to bed in my shit-hole apartment,
and woke up in an actual shit-hole.

33
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:27,285
What about you, huh?

34
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,872
There's... There's not much to tell.

35
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,376
I was on my way home from work, and...

36
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,503
I don't remember anything else.

37
00:04:42,342 --> 00:04:44,343
First dead body I've ever seen.

38
00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:47,178
They look different in real life.

39
00:04:49,306 --> 00:04:51,349
They don't move.

40
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:58,982
From the looks of these chains,

41
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,817
someone didn't want us
to go very far, either.

42
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:06,196
-Can you see any scars?
-What?

43
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,073
Man, they kidnap you and drug you.

44
00:05:08,157 --> 00:05:11,076
Before you know, you're in a bath
and your kidneys are on eBay.

45
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:13,786
No-one has taken your kidneys.

46
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,580
How can you tell from way over there?

47
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:20,000
You'd either be in terrible agony,
or you'd be dead by now.

48
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:21,460
Trust me.

49
00:05:21,545 --> 00:05:23,587
-What are you, a surgeon?
-Yeah.

50
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:28,007
So...

51
00:05:29,552 --> 00:05:32,137
Are you gonna tell me
your name, or what?

52
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:37,642
Adam.

53
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,853
Well, Adam...

54
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:44,732
What we need to do...

55
00:05:44,816 --> 00:05:47,151
is start thinking about why we're here.

56
00:05:47,235 --> 00:05:50,779
Whoever brought us here
could have killed us by now.

57
00:05:50,863 --> 00:05:52,155
But they didn't.

58
00:05:53,073 --> 00:05:55,116
They must want something from us.

59
00:05:57,035 --> 00:05:59,078
The question is, what?

60
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,918
-That clock.
-What about it?

61
00:06:07,003 --> 00:06:09,963
-It's brand-new.
-So?

62
00:06:10,047 --> 00:06:13,967
So... somebody obviously
wanted us to know the time.

63
00:06:17,596 --> 00:06:20,806
Wait, I think I might be
able to reach the door.

64
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,706
What is that?

65
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:52,502
Excuse me.

66
00:06:52,587 --> 00:06:54,546
It's a tape.

67
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,548
-Where did you find it?
-It was in my pocket.

68
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:07,892
It says, "Play me. "

69
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,422
Come on. Come on.

70
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:46,052
Throw it over here.

71
00:07:53,434 --> 00:07:55,185
Fuck.

72
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:07,863
No?

73
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:37,391
-Use your shirt.
-What?

74
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,518
Your shirt.

75
00:08:53,364 --> 00:08:55,365
Come on.

76
00:09:00,496 --> 00:09:02,497
-It won't work.
-Look around.

77
00:09:02,582 --> 00:09:04,624
There must be something else you can use.

78
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:08,461
-There's nothing.
-Well, there must be something.

79
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:23,516
Come on. You can do it.

80
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,522
Come on. Come on.

81
00:09:29,606 --> 00:09:30,898
Again.

82
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,963
Rise and shine, Adam.

83
00:09:56,047 --> 00:09:58,507
You're probably wondering where you are.

84
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:01,092
I'll tell you where you might be.

85
00:10:01,177 --> 00:10:04,054
You might be in the room that you die in.

86
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:10,060
Up until now, you've simply sat in the shadows,
watching others live out their lives.

87
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:14,438
But what do voyeurs see
when they look into the mirror?

88
00:10:14,522 --> 00:10:20,152
Now, I see you as a strange mix
of someone angry yet apathetic.

89
00:10:20,237 --> 00:10:22,238
But mostly just pathetic.

90
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,490
So, are you going to watch
yourself die today, Adam,

91
00:10:25,574 --> 00:10:27,617
or do something about it?

92
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:31,120
I don't get it.

93
00:10:31,997 --> 00:10:33,248
Throw me the player.

94
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:38,460
No. You throw me your tape.

95
00:10:39,796 --> 00:10:43,590
Look, we're gonna have to work together,
if we want to get out of here.

96
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:46,134
-Throw it to me.
-I'm not gonna risk breaking it.

97
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:48,262
You throw me your tape.

98
00:11:05,152 --> 00:11:07,153
Dr. Gordon...

99
00:11:07,238 --> 00:11:09,739
this is your wake-up call.

100
00:11:09,824 --> 00:11:13,660
Every day of your working life,
you have given people the news

101
00:11:13,743 --> 00:11:16,120
that they're gonna die soon.

102
00:11:16,204 --> 00:11:20,040
Now you will be the cause of death.

103
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:24,044
Your aim in this game is to kill Adam.

104
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:26,213
You have until 6 on the clock to do it.

105
00:11:27,506 --> 00:11:30,091
There's a man in the room with you.

106
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,760
When there's that much poison in your blood,

107
00:11:32,845 --> 00:11:36,431
the only thing left to do is shoot yourself.

108
00:11:42,478 --> 00:11:46,857
There are ways to win this,
hidden all around you.

109
00:11:46,941 --> 00:11:52,279
Just remember,
X marks the spot for the treasure.

110
00:11:52,362 --> 00:11:55,239
If you do not kill Adam by six,

111
00:11:56,616 --> 00:12:00,119
then Alison and Diana will die,
Dr. Gordon.

112
00:12:01,204 --> 00:12:04,540
And I'll leave you in
this room to rot.

113
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,876
Let the game begin.

114
00:12:17,343 --> 00:12:19,344
Give me that.

115
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:20,554
Now.

116
00:12:29,564 --> 00:12:32,983
Then Alison and Diana will die,
Dr. Gordon...

117
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:36,944
...and I'll leave you in
this room to rot.

118
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:42,200
-Any idea who that is?
-Let the game begin.

119
00:12:42,284 --> 00:12:45,953
-He knows us.
-Wait a minute.

120
00:12:46,037 --> 00:12:49,122
What do you think? Probably a joke, right?

121
00:12:49,207 --> 00:12:50,707
Shh!

122
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:54,044
-Let the game begin.
-Listen. Listen.

123
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:57,130
Follow your heart.

124
00:13:04,888 --> 00:13:07,139
What the hell does "follow your heart" mean?

125
00:13:13,729 --> 00:13:16,940
There, right next to you, on the toilet.

126
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:29,535
Come on. Come on.

127
00:13:33,206 --> 00:13:35,249
Oh, man!

128
00:13:43,131 --> 00:13:45,883
-Anything?
-No solids.

129
00:13:45,968 --> 00:13:47,301
Take off the lid.

130
00:13:49,845 --> 00:13:51,471
Come on.

131
00:14:01,356 --> 00:14:03,607
I really wish I had've checked in there first.

132
00:14:03,692 --> 00:14:05,859
Huh! What is it?

133
00:14:34,762 --> 00:14:36,013
Hey.

134
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,099
Mind passing me the other one?

135
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,208
Fuck! Fuck!

136
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,251
He doesn't want us to cut through our chains.

137
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:58,130
He wants us to cut through our feet.

138
00:16:02,134 --> 00:16:04,344
I think I may know who's done this to us.

139
00:16:04,428 --> 00:16:06,846
What did you say?

140
00:16:06,931 --> 00:16:08,973
Well, it's not someone I know personally.

141
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:11,517
It's just someone I know of.

142
00:16:12,602 --> 00:16:15,062
Jesus Christ! Tell me. Who is it?

143
00:16:17,524 --> 00:16:19,566
Last I heard...

144
00:16:20,777 --> 00:16:23,445
.. the police still hadn't caught him.

145
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:25,863
And the only reason I know that...

146
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:27,990
is because I was a suspect.

147
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,453
I'll start from the beginning.

148
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:43,713
This one's not fresh any more.
At least three weeks out.

149
00:16:43,798 --> 00:16:47,050
Victim's a 46-year-old male.

150
00:16:48,593 --> 00:16:53,264
Died of massive blood loss,
mostly through the femoral artery.

151
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:00,396
He started at the back and tunneled
through that razor wire so fast,

152
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,523
it's amazing he got as far as he did.

153
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:08,736
Cut himself so deep,
we found traces of stomach acid on the floor.

154
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,285
We also found this.

155
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:24,084
Hello, Paul. You are a
perfectly healthy, sane, middle-class male,

156
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,502
yet last month,

157
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,255
you ran a straight razor across your wrists.

158
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:33,134
Did you cut yourself
because you truly wanted to die,

159
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,845
or did you just want some attention?

160
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,472
Tonight, you'll show me.

161
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,517
The irony is that if you want to die,

162
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,019
you just have to stay where you are.

163
00:17:44,103 --> 00:17:46,688
If you want to live,
you'll have to cut yourself again.

164
00:17:46,772 --> 00:17:49,941
Find a path through the razor wire to the door.

165
00:17:50,026 --> 00:17:51,359
But hurry.

166
00:17:52,528 --> 00:17:55,447
At three o'clock that door will lock.

167
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,032
And then this room becomes your tomb.

168
00:17:58,116 --> 00:18:01,452
How much blood will you shed
to stay alive, Paul?

169
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,459
Door was on a timer.
It was unlocked until three o'clock.

170
00:18:09,877 --> 00:18:13,337
Then it slammed shut. He was given two hours.

171
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,925
You sick fuck!

172
00:18:23,723 --> 00:18:25,432
A jigsaw piece.

173
00:18:30,313 --> 00:18:33,148
I think we're gonna be here for a while, Sing.

174
00:18:33,231 --> 00:18:36,942
The newspapers started
calling him "the jigsaw killer".

175
00:18:37,027 --> 00:18:40,362
Actually, technically speaking,

176
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:43,991
he's... not really a murderer.

177
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:47,577
He never killed anyone.

178
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:50,705
He finds ways for his victims
to kill themselves.

179
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:56,586
Hello, Mark. If you're so sick,

180
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,881
then why do I have so many photos of you
up and about?

181
00:19:00,548 --> 00:19:03,842
Let's put your so-called illness to the test.

182
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:09,056
Right now, there's a slow-acting
poison in your veins.

183
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,142
The antidote is inside the safe.

184
00:19:12,226 --> 00:19:13,267
Help!

185
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:18,481
The combination to the safe...
is written on the wall.

186
00:19:18,565 --> 00:19:20,650
Hurry up and program it in.

187
00:19:20,734 --> 00:19:22,860
But watch your step.

188
00:19:22,945 --> 00:19:28,199
By the way, that's a flammable substance
smeared on your body.

189
00:19:28,282 --> 00:19:31,493
So, I would be careful
with that candle, if I were you.

190
00:19:31,577 --> 00:19:37,332
Or all the people you've burned with your act
just might have their revenge.

191
00:19:41,836 --> 00:19:43,045
Aaaargh!

192
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:45,756
I found something else.

193
00:19:46,883 --> 00:19:48,884
Well, two things, actually.

194
00:19:48,969 --> 00:19:52,221
There was someone standing outside,
watching through this hole.

195
00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:57,141
Our friend Jigsaw likes to book himself
front-row seats to his own sick little games.

196
00:19:57,226 --> 00:19:59,519
He was there at the last one as well.

197
00:20:00,646 --> 00:20:03,982
Only, this time... he left us his penlight.

198
00:20:07,902 --> 00:20:09,444
Hm...

199
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,531
Get a rush on the prints.

200
00:20:12,615 --> 00:20:14,992
Copy that.

201
00:20:15,076 --> 00:20:19,079
This patient has an inoperable frontal lobe
tumor extending across the midline.

202
00:20:19,162 --> 00:20:21,998
It started as colon cancer.

203
00:20:22,082 --> 00:20:25,334
The patient has come in for a standard checkup,

204
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:29,046
by which we can monitor the rate
at which his condition is declining.

205
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,548
-The patient had...
-His name is John.

206
00:20:32,758 --> 00:20:35,927
Dr. Gordon. He's a very interesting person.

207
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:40,640
Thank you for that information, Zep.

208
00:20:40,725 --> 00:20:44,686
As you can see, our orderlies
form very special bonds with the patients.

209
00:20:46,021 --> 00:20:48,063
Continuing on, the patient had...

210
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:50,983
Dr. Gordon, please page the operator.

211
00:20:52,527 --> 00:20:57,031
Someone doesn't want me to tell you
what the patient had! Excuse me.

212
00:21:01,785 --> 00:21:03,077
Dr. Gordon.

213
00:21:04,204 --> 00:21:07,415
I'm Detective Tapp, this is Detective Sing.
City homicide.

214
00:21:07,498 --> 00:21:12,210
-Very impressive.
-Oh, thank you.

215
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:14,046
I do my best.

216
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,176
-Sorry to interrupt you while you work.
-Fine.

217
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,303
Now, how can I help you gentlemen?

218
00:21:21,386 --> 00:21:27,266
Are you able to tell us where you were
between the hours of 11 PM and 1 AM last night?

219
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:30,227
Why is it that you're interested?

220
00:21:30,312 --> 00:21:32,730
We'd like to ask a few questions about it.

221
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:37,484
For your sake, I think it's best
if we do it down at the station.

222
00:21:37,568 --> 00:21:42,197
-Would you like to follow us there?
-I'm afraid that's out of the question.

223
00:21:42,281 --> 00:21:46,576
I can't just leave, I have work to do.
Plus my wife has the car today.

224
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:48,994
That's OK. You can ride with us.

225
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,412
Doc?

226
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:57,044
I'm sorry.

227
00:21:57,128 --> 00:22:00,798
You'll have to tell me again.
What is this all about?

228
00:22:01,924 --> 00:22:03,966
Is this yours, Doctor?

229
00:22:16,604 --> 00:22:20,148
So you have no idea how your penlight
showed up at the murder scene?

230
00:22:20,233 --> 00:22:22,275
Of course not, Brett.

231
00:22:25,695 --> 00:22:28,948
Well, I have to ask.
What were you doing last night?

232
00:22:31,868 --> 00:22:33,911
I was seeing someone.

233
00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:36,914
Who?

234
00:22:40,584 --> 00:22:42,961
Look, if you can't be honest with me...

235
00:22:43,045 --> 00:22:45,088
I was visiting someone, It wasn't a patient.

236
00:22:45,172 --> 00:22:47,048
All right?

237
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,469
What am I gonna do?

238
00:22:51,553 --> 00:22:54,137
Well, as your lawyer and your friend,

239
00:22:54,222 --> 00:22:59,518
my advice to you is to bite the bullet
and give them your alibi now,

240
00:22:59,602 --> 00:23:01,770
cos no-one's gonna believe you later.

241
00:23:07,317 --> 00:23:09,360
That was five months ago.

242
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:15,032
He tried to set me up for murder.

243
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:20,537
OK.

244
00:23:21,622 --> 00:23:23,999
We checked your alibi, It holds up.

245
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:27,252
Good. Can I go home now?

246
00:23:27,336 --> 00:23:30,630
We have one of the victims
who managed to escape.

247
00:23:30,714 --> 00:23:35,092
Want to know if you wouldn't mind sticking
around and listening to her testimony.

248
00:23:35,176 --> 00:23:37,177
Maybe it'll trigger something.

249
00:23:37,262 --> 00:23:41,348
-I'd like to help, really, but...
-Well, we'd appreciate it.

250
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:43,934
-She's the only one who made it.
-OK.

251
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,566
Amanda...

252
00:23:52,651 --> 00:23:55,069
In your own time...

253
00:23:55,153 --> 00:23:57,821
tell me the first thing you remember.

254
00:24:12,085 --> 00:24:14,211
I woke up.

255
00:24:14,296 --> 00:24:16,464
All I could taste was blood.

256
00:24:18,175 --> 00:24:19,717
And metal.

257
00:24:48,911 --> 00:24:50,953
Hello, Amanda.

258
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:54,957
You don't know me, but I know you.

259
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:57,376
I want to play a game.

260
00:24:57,461 --> 00:25:00,421
Here's what happens if you lose.

261
00:25:00,505 --> 00:25:05,258
The device you're wearing
is hooked into your upper and lower jaws.

262
00:25:05,343 --> 00:25:07,719
When the timer on the back goes off,

263
00:25:07,804 --> 00:25:11,223
your mouth will be permanently ripped open.

264
00:25:11,307 --> 00:25:14,059
Think of it like a reverse bear trap.

265
00:25:15,102 --> 00:25:17,561
Here, I'll show you.

266
00:25:28,948 --> 00:25:32,367
There's only one key to open the device.

267
00:25:32,451 --> 00:25:35,995
It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate.

268
00:25:37,832 --> 00:25:39,415
Look around, Amanda.

269
00:25:39,499 --> 00:25:41,667
Know that I'm not lying.

270
00:25:41,751 --> 00:25:44,169
You'd better hurry up.

271
00:25:44,254 --> 00:25:46,296
Live or die.

272
00:25:46,381 --> 00:25:48,215
Make your choice.

273
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:08,233
No!

274
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,752
And then I saw the body.

275
00:26:51,357 --> 00:26:53,400
There was a knife.

276
00:27:26,473 --> 00:27:29,058
He'd been injected with an opiate overdose.

277
00:27:30,352 --> 00:27:32,686
Couldn't move or feel much of anything.

278
00:27:35,272 --> 00:27:37,815
You mean... he was alive?

279
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,108
Was.

280
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:42,820
What happened after you took it off?

281
00:28:45,254 --> 00:28:48,589
Congratulations. You are still alive.

282
00:28:49,675 --> 00:28:53,219
Most people are so ungrateful to be alive.

283
00:28:53,302 --> 00:28:56,596
But not you. Not any more.

284
00:29:02,854 --> 00:29:06,857
You are, in fact, a drug addict.
Isn't that right, Mandy?

285
00:29:10,652 --> 00:29:13,153
Do you think that is why he picked you?

286
00:29:19,118 --> 00:29:21,160
Are you grateful, Mandy?

287
00:29:26,292 --> 00:29:29,961
He... helped me.

288
00:30:07,496 --> 00:30:09,539
Are you sure it's him?

289
00:30:10,665 --> 00:30:14,460
-Yeah, I'm sure.
-How do I know you're telling the truth?

290
00:30:14,544 --> 00:30:17,171
You could be the one who put me in this room!

291
00:30:17,255 --> 00:30:22,092
I'm in exactly the same situation you're in.

292
00:30:22,177 --> 00:30:25,471
Wrong. Wrong! You've got one thing I don't.

293
00:30:25,554 --> 00:30:27,680
Information. You know who did this.

294
00:30:29,892 --> 00:30:33,853
Now, you either tell me what is really going on,
or I'll cut you with this!

295
00:30:33,937 --> 00:30:35,980
I'll cu...

296
00:30:41,611 --> 00:30:44,112
-What?
-It's a two-way mirror.

297
00:31:13,933 --> 00:31:16,935
I can see you.

298
00:31:17,018 --> 00:31:20,604
So, that's what this is. Reality TV.

299
00:31:20,688 --> 00:31:23,315
Don't look at me, I can't help you.

300
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:27,152
Can you hear me in there? Huh?
I'm having a blast.

301
00:31:27,236 --> 00:31:30,530
This is the most fun I've had without lubricant.

302
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:33,449
Make sure you're getting everything.

303
00:31:35,577 --> 00:31:37,829
That's not gonna do anything.

304
00:31:39,872 --> 00:31:42,582
-You want to leave it running on us?
-You won't stop it.

305
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:46,962
That's why we can't cut through these chains
or why you won't break that glass.

306
00:31:47,046 --> 00:31:50,298
Every possible angle
has been pre-thought out by him.

307
00:31:50,383 --> 00:31:53,260
You make it sound like you admire this prick.

308
00:31:53,343 --> 00:31:57,096
To overcome something, you have to
understand what a perfect engine it is.

309
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,889
That's how you fight disease.

310
00:31:59,975 --> 00:32:03,394
The tape told us to find an X.

311
00:32:03,478 --> 00:32:06,981
That X has to be somewhere in this room.
Help me find it.

312
00:32:07,064 --> 00:32:10,441
How can you be the calm doctor when
your wife and kid are out there?

313
00:32:10,526 --> 00:32:13,236
He has them too.
He could be doing anything to them now.

314
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,532
-Are you thinking about that?
-I am thinking about that.

315
00:32:24,122 --> 00:32:27,291
I've been thinking about
the last thing I said to my daughter.

316
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:12,971
Diana, honey, are you OK?

317
00:34:15,015 --> 00:34:17,308
Diana, honey, can you hear me?

318
00:34:17,393 --> 00:34:20,812
-Mommy...
-What is it, sweet pea?

319
00:34:20,896 --> 00:34:23,523
There's a man in my room.

320
00:34:23,607 --> 00:34:27,193
Oh, honey, are you sure he's not
just hiding in your imagination?

321
00:34:27,277 --> 00:34:29,320
He talked to me.

322
00:34:30,738 --> 00:34:33,698
OK, I'll come and check your room.

323
00:34:33,783 --> 00:34:36,827
I want Daddy. He'll get the scary man.

324
00:34:38,454 --> 00:34:41,540
All right, if you want. Come on.

325
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:48,838
Larry, sorry to bother you,
but your daughter had a bad dream again.

326
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:50,339
Just a minute.

327
00:34:51,383 --> 00:34:53,801
She wants you to check her room.

328
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:56,344
Mm-hm. Just got to finish this paragraph.

329
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:02,892
Come on, sweetie, I'll check with you.

330
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:07,063
Nope, I'm done.

331
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:12,067
See? There's no-one in your room.

332
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:16,446
There's no such thing as the Bad Man.

333
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:20,367
-Now can you go to sleep?
-I'm still scared.

334
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,743
You are? Give me your tootsie.

335
00:35:25,205 --> 00:35:27,206
Oh, what a big tootsie.

336
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,500
Remember this one?

337
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,794
This little piggy went to market.

338
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,130
This little piggy stayed home.

339
00:35:34,213 --> 00:35:36,423
This little piggy had roast beef.

340
00:35:36,507 --> 00:35:38,633
This little piggy had none.

341
00:35:38,718 --> 00:35:40,844
This little piggy ran...

342
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:43,847
Whee! All the way home!

343
00:35:46,808 --> 00:35:48,350
I hate that thing.

344
00:35:49,477 --> 00:35:51,812
Well, I have to go to work, sweetheart.

345
00:35:51,897 --> 00:35:54,648
You know what Daddy's job is like.
Now, come on.

346
00:35:56,026 --> 00:35:57,651
Let's see.

347
00:35:58,986 --> 00:36:00,945
Try and get some sleep, now, OK?

348
00:36:07,328 --> 00:36:10,788
You're not gonna leave us, are you, Daddy?

349
00:36:12,457 --> 00:36:14,499
What?

350
00:36:15,793 --> 00:36:17,669
What are you talking about?

351
00:36:18,421 --> 00:36:20,589
You mean, leave you and Mommy?

352
00:36:22,342 --> 00:36:25,052
No. No, sweetheart, I...

353
00:36:25,135 --> 00:36:27,178
I would never do that.

354
00:36:28,305 --> 00:36:31,432
-Who gave you that idea?
-No-one.

355
00:36:32,726 --> 00:36:35,102
Well, it's not true. OK?

356
00:36:36,355 --> 00:36:39,398
-OK.
-How much do I love you?

357
00:36:39,482 --> 00:36:42,442
-Love you very much.
-That's right. That's right.

358
00:36:43,903 --> 00:36:46,571
-Good night, sweetie.
-Good night, Daddy.

359
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:54,536
Tomorrow... I'll read you your favorite story.

360
00:36:54,621 --> 00:36:56,080
OK.

361
00:36:56,164 --> 00:36:58,999
I don't know
how much longer I can do this.

362
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:02,169
-What are you talking about?
-How can you pretend you're happy?

363
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:05,547
-I am happy.
-That is complete bullshit.

364
00:37:05,631 --> 00:37:07,924
I'd rather you just tell me you hate me.

365
00:37:08,008 --> 00:37:10,426
At least there would be some passion in it.

366
00:37:14,556 --> 00:37:16,599
Would you like to see her?

367
00:37:34,032 --> 00:37:36,659
-She's beautiful.
-Thank you.

368
00:37:38,036 --> 00:37:40,037
You gonna have any more kids?

369
00:37:40,122 --> 00:37:43,124
Ah, we've... talked about it, but er...

370
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:47,377
.. with our schedules,

371
00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:50,004
it's difficult enough to concentrate on one.

372
00:37:51,132 --> 00:37:53,842
So, where's the lucky wife?

373
00:37:53,926 --> 00:37:57,178
There's another picture
behind the one you're looking at.

374
00:37:57,262 --> 00:38:01,765
It's my favorite one because...
we're all in it together.

375
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:05,394
Someone, usually me, has to hold the camera,

376
00:38:05,478 --> 00:38:08,522
which means I'm always missing
from the photos.

377
00:38:24,453 --> 00:38:27,831
It's er... It's not here.

378
00:38:27,915 --> 00:38:29,583
What?

379
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:33,044
This photo you're talking about's not here.

380
00:38:33,128 --> 00:38:35,254
Really? Are you sure?

381
00:38:35,338 --> 00:38:37,381
Yeah. Just...

382
00:38:50,019 --> 00:38:53,771
Why, he... he must have taken it, I...

383
00:38:53,856 --> 00:38:55,857
How can you pretend you're happy?

384
00:38:55,941 --> 00:38:59,736
-I am happy.
-That is complete bullshit.

385
00:38:59,819 --> 00:39:01,820
I'd rather you just tell me you hate me.

386
00:39:01,905 --> 00:39:03,947
At least there would be some passion in it.

387
00:39:06,993 --> 00:39:09,036
We'll talk about this later. OK?

388
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,082
Just leave.

389
00:39:48,531 --> 00:39:50,824
Good night, little girl.

390
00:39:57,331 --> 00:39:58,039
Diana?

391
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:01,417
Diana?

392
00:40:05,254 --> 00:40:06,213
Diana!

393
00:40:16,973 --> 00:40:19,016
Mommy!

394
00:40:22,437 --> 00:40:24,480
Shh.

395
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,375
Don't you dare!

396
00:40:46,459 --> 00:40:48,460
Get away from her!

397
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,678
Mommy!

398
00:41:08,563 --> 00:41:09,771
Mommy!

399
00:41:09,856 --> 00:41:13,150
Mommy! Mommy!

400
00:41:13,234 --> 00:41:15,986
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!

401
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:18,071
Get off of her!

402
00:41:44,763 --> 00:41:48,850
Oh, you little man! I see you.

403
00:41:52,729 --> 00:41:55,772
Does Dr. Gordon know
you're at home with his wife?

404
00:41:58,568 --> 00:42:00,611
I know you know something.

405
00:42:06,909 --> 00:42:08,993
What are you doing in there?

406
00:42:09,077 --> 00:42:12,914
Waiting for the doctor?
I'm waiting for the doctor, too.

407
00:42:15,374 --> 00:42:16,833
Huh!

408
00:42:25,384 --> 00:42:27,427
I never should have let you go.

409
00:42:36,561 --> 00:42:40,064
There was someone
standing outside here watching.

410
00:42:40,147 --> 00:42:41,981
I want to play a game.

411
00:42:43,567 --> 00:42:47,195
Jigsaw piece.
We're gonna be here for a while. Sing.

412
00:42:47,279 --> 00:42:49,322
Hello, Amanda.

413
00:42:52,659 --> 00:42:55,452
Dr. Gordon, are you able to tell us
where were you last night?

414
00:42:55,536 --> 00:42:59,539
You have no idea how your penlight
showed up at the murder scene?

415
00:42:59,624 --> 00:43:02,417
-We checked your alibi, it holds up.
-Isn't that right?

416
00:43:02,502 --> 00:43:04,628
I never should have let you go.

417
00:43:09,716 --> 00:43:11,676
Here we are.

418
00:43:12,803 --> 00:43:14,720
That was er...

419
00:43:14,805 --> 00:43:17,223
quite an amazing story that poor woman told.

420
00:43:32,946 --> 00:43:34,154
Look, I'm...

421
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:38,951
I'm sorry I can't be of more help
to your investigation.

422
00:43:40,704 --> 00:43:43,580
You know, we arrested a dentist last week.

423
00:43:43,664 --> 00:43:45,832
He liked to play with kids a bit too much.

424
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:48,668
He lived two blocks from here.

425
00:43:50,087 --> 00:43:54,716
The sewer lines run under this neighborhood,
too... Doctor.

426
00:44:19,322 --> 00:44:21,782
Hello, Amanda.

427
00:44:21,866 --> 00:44:25,618
You don't know me, but I know you.

428
00:44:25,703 --> 00:44:29,914
I want to play a game.
Here's what happens if you lose.

429
00:44:32,877 --> 00:44:36,129
There's a timer at the back
of the device you're wearing.

430
00:44:36,212 --> 00:44:38,297
When the timer goes off...

431
00:44:42,051 --> 00:44:45,596
-I'll catch you guys down there.
-... like a reverse bear trap.

432
00:44:51,393 --> 00:44:52,977
I'll show you.

433
00:44:56,231 --> 00:44:59,650
-Hey, Tapp.
-Hmm?

434
00:44:59,735 --> 00:45:02,945
We're gonna go down to get a beer.
You want to come?

435
00:45:03,029 --> 00:45:04,821
I don't think so. But thanks, anyway.

436
00:45:04,906 --> 00:45:07,699
Well, you know, I always ask.

437
00:45:07,783 --> 00:45:10,327
-There is one key to open the device.
-Have fun.

438
00:45:10,411 --> 00:45:13,914
It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate.

439
00:45:13,997 --> 00:45:17,416
Hey, Tapp.
I don't mean for this to be disrespectful.

440
00:45:19,169 --> 00:45:22,046
Maybe you should find yourself a girlfriend.

441
00:45:24,758 --> 00:45:28,886
It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate.
Look around...

442
00:45:31,472 --> 00:45:34,849
Look around, Amanda. Know that I'm not lying.

443
00:45:35,976 --> 00:45:38,019
You'd better hurry up.

444
00:45:40,146 --> 00:45:42,189
Wait, wait, wait. Sing.

445
00:45:44,776 --> 00:45:46,568
-Get back here.
-What?

446
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:55,952
What?

447
00:45:59,998 --> 00:46:01,958
Remember 118th Street?

448
00:46:04,586 --> 00:46:09,423
Er... K2K. That gang's territory
was only about four blocks.

449
00:46:09,507 --> 00:46:11,549
Now, listen to this.

450
00:46:25,522 --> 00:46:29,858
Check the records for all fire emergencies
in that area within the last two weeks.

451
00:46:29,943 --> 00:46:31,276
Go -right now.

452
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,443
Mmm!

453
00:46:32,528 --> 00:46:38,157
On Tuesday 17th, a fire alarm went off
in the rear wing of 213 Stygian Street.

454
00:46:38,242 --> 00:46:42,245
It's an old listing.
Used to be a mannequin factory.

455
00:46:42,329 --> 00:46:44,372
Think we have enough for a warrant, though?

456
00:46:44,455 --> 00:46:46,498
Who said anything about a warrant?

457
00:46:46,582 --> 00:46:47,999
Right now?

458
00:46:48,084 --> 00:46:49,835
Why not?

459
00:46:49,919 --> 00:46:51,586
Yeah, why not?

460
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,598
At least we'll have the cover of darkness.

461
00:47:04,683 --> 00:47:07,017
Yeah, well, so will anybody else.

462
00:47:53,227 --> 00:47:55,270
I got you.

463
00:48:46,985 --> 00:48:49,111
What the hell is this?

464
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,837
Shit.

465
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,640
Oh, fuck!

466
00:49:35,154 --> 00:49:37,614
Wait, Sing. Let's see what he's gonna do.

467
00:49:37,699 --> 00:49:40,742
-Why? We fuckin' got him.
-We don't know what he looks like.

468
00:49:40,827 --> 00:49:43,620
-Let's see what he's gonna do.
-No fucking way.

469
00:49:43,705 --> 00:49:45,497
Fuck that, I'm gonna take him.

470
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,665
What the fuck? Shit!

471
00:50:33,125 --> 00:50:36,836
Awake already, Jeff?

472
00:50:37,879 --> 00:50:40,172
I need more-powerful tranquillizers next time.

473
00:50:40,256 --> 00:50:43,216
Don't cry, I've given your life a purpose.

474
00:50:44,343 --> 00:50:47,429
You're a test subject
for something greater than yourself.

475
00:50:47,513 --> 00:50:48,680
Freeze!

476
00:50:48,764 --> 00:50:51,266
-Hold it right there!
-Put your hands in the air!

477
00:50:59,441 --> 00:51:04,153
Now you'll make a choice.
In 20 seconds, the life of this man will be ended.

478
00:51:04,236 --> 00:51:05,904
-Get down here!
-Turn it off!

479
00:51:07,823 --> 00:51:09,866
Sing, stop that thing, I'm taking him down.

480
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:10,992
Fine.

481
00:51:11,076 --> 00:51:12,410
Move!

482
00:51:12,495 --> 00:51:14,579
-How do you turn it off?
-Tell him, asshole!

483
00:51:14,663 --> 00:51:17,165
One key will unlock it.
-Where is it?

484
00:51:17,248 --> 00:51:19,416
-It's in the box.
-Box?

485
00:51:21,628 --> 00:51:23,170
Fuck!

486
00:51:25,006 --> 00:51:28,258
-Which key? Which key?
-Tell him which key it is!

487
00:51:28,342 --> 00:51:30,635
-Time's running out.
-Shut up and get down here!

488
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:31,969
Now, asshole!

489
00:51:33,472 --> 00:51:38,309
What's more important to you, Officer?
Arresting me or the life of a human being?

490
00:51:38,393 --> 00:51:42,688
Get down on your knees, asshole!
Hands behind your head!

491
00:51:42,772 --> 00:51:45,398
-Tapp!
-Sick bastard!

492
00:51:45,483 --> 00:51:49,361
-Yes, I'm sick, Officer.
-Tapp, there's a hundred keys here!

493
00:51:49,445 --> 00:51:52,072
Sick from the disease eating away at me inside.

494
00:51:52,156 --> 00:51:55,784
Sick of people
who don't appreciate their blessings.

495
00:51:55,867 --> 00:51:58,786
Sick of those who scoff at the suffering of others.

496
00:52:02,374 --> 00:52:03,874
I'm sick of 'em all!

497
00:52:05,001 --> 00:52:05,918
Tapp!

498
00:52:15,052 --> 00:52:17,512
No! No! Tapp! Tapp!

499
00:52:17,596 --> 00:52:20,640
Shit! You're OK. Let me see.

500
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:26,812
I'll be back, I'm gonna be back, OK? I'll be back.

501
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,593
Freeze, or I'll shoot!

502
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:33,970
I had you.

503
00:54:34,055 --> 00:54:36,473
I had you on your knees.

504
00:54:36,557 --> 00:54:39,518
But you're running. You're running.

505
00:54:41,521 --> 00:54:44,105
You're running scared cos...
cos we had you.

506
00:54:45,524 --> 00:54:47,566
We're gonna close this case.

507
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:51,737
Gonna close it. Right, Sing? Right?

508
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:53,864
We're gonna close it, Sing.

509
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:05,833
"X" marks the spot.
"X" marks the spot.

510
00:55:06,835 --> 00:55:08,836
We need to search this room again.

511
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,921
What are you doing over there?

512
00:55:13,174 --> 00:55:14,549
Excuse me.

513
00:55:14,634 --> 00:55:16,802
Just because I'm stuck in this room with you

514
00:55:16,886 --> 00:55:19,972
doesn't mean I have to report
to you every 10 seconds.

515
00:55:21,056 --> 00:55:24,433
I really don't see the point
in us not helping one another.

516
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:27,728
What do you want me to do? I'm on a leash.

517
00:55:27,813 --> 00:55:30,064
That's exactly why we need to talk and think.

518
00:55:30,148 --> 00:55:33,359
-I am thinking!
-Then don't keep me in the dark

519
00:55:33,443 --> 00:55:35,486
about what you're thinking!

520
00:55:39,031 --> 00:55:40,657
Turn off the lights.

521
00:55:40,741 --> 00:55:42,075
What?

522
00:55:43,202 --> 00:55:45,078
Turn them off now, please.

523
00:55:45,162 --> 00:55:47,998
-Why?
-Just turn them off for a second.

524
00:56:03,345 --> 00:56:04,971
Jesus. Behind you.

525
00:56:09,309 --> 00:56:11,519
How come we didn't see that before?

526
00:56:11,603 --> 00:56:15,565
The lights in here hadn't charged it.
It's glow-in-the-dark paint or something.

527
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,479
-Open it!
-It's locked.

528
00:56:59,606 --> 00:57:02,733
The key... the one from my envelope.
Where is it?

529
00:57:06,737 --> 00:57:09,238
Where the fuck? Here.

530
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:38,849
A cellphone.

531
00:57:38,934 --> 00:57:41,227
The most beautiful invention on this planet.

532
00:57:46,524 --> 00:57:49,234
Make that second-most beautiful invention.

533
00:57:49,318 --> 00:57:50,902
Give me that.

534
00:57:50,986 --> 00:57:55,698
Are you joking? You're going to put something
you found in this room in your mouth?

535
00:57:55,782 --> 00:57:58,242
Yes, I'm willing to risk it.

536
00:57:58,326 --> 00:57:59,993
Give me that sweet cancer.

537
00:58:01,246 --> 00:58:04,164
I don't care, I really don't.

538
00:58:04,249 --> 00:58:06,250
Give me one of those.

539
00:58:06,334 --> 00:58:08,877
The cigarettes
are harmless, I promise.

540
00:58:08,961 --> 00:58:14,882
Smoking is only poisonous when it ends
in bloodshed. Think about this.

541
00:58:14,967 --> 00:58:16,968
You don't need a gun to kill Adam.

542
00:58:17,052 --> 00:58:19,637
May I please have a cigarette?

543
00:58:21,098 --> 00:58:23,140
I'm trying the police.

544
00:58:32,441 --> 00:58:34,484
Shit.

545
00:58:35,986 --> 00:58:38,737
This was meant to receive calls, not make them.

546
00:58:41,032 --> 00:58:42,825
Wait a minute.

547
00:58:42,909 --> 00:58:44,952
This has happened before.

548
00:58:48,872 --> 00:58:52,375
Last night, after I finished at the hospital...

549
00:58:54,878 --> 00:58:56,921
...I was walking back to my car.

550
00:58:58,841 --> 00:59:00,883
I thought I was alone, but...

551
00:59:01,968 --> 00:59:04,011
...I'm sure someone else was there.

552
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:48,427
Great.

553
01:00:32,134 --> 01:00:36,554
That... thing... was waiting for me.

554
01:00:46,564 --> 01:00:49,233
How did you know to turn off the lights?

555
01:00:49,317 --> 01:00:52,486
-Who cares? It worked.
-Yeah, but how did you know?

556
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:54,154
Instinct.

557
01:00:54,239 --> 01:00:55,614
Instinct?

558
01:00:55,698 --> 01:00:57,491
-Yeah.
-You know what?

559
01:00:58,617 --> 01:01:00,284
You're a terrible liar.

560
01:01:00,369 --> 01:01:02,995
You say that like you know me.

561
01:01:04,081 --> 01:01:06,082
What else aren't you telling me?

562
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:08,793
Well, um, let's see...

563
01:01:09,919 --> 01:01:13,046
On my sixth birthday, my best friend at the time,
Scott Tibbs,

564
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:15,590
stabbed me with a rusty nail -
I didn't tell you that.

565
01:01:15,675 --> 01:01:18,552
My last girlfriend, a feminist vegan punk,

566
01:01:18,636 --> 01:01:21,096
broke up with me because I was too angry.

567
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:24,808
-One of my toenails is slightly...
-Just stop it!

568
01:01:25,934 --> 01:01:28,060
You knew to turn off these lights.

569
01:01:28,144 --> 01:01:31,146
-Whatever.
-I'm dealing with a juvenile.

570
01:01:32,274 --> 01:01:35,067
-You wanna know?
-Yeah!

571
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:38,444
Here it is.

572
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:51,206
Come.

573
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,419
Oh, God.

574
01:02:01,258 --> 01:02:03,384
W-Where did you get this?

575
01:02:03,468 --> 01:02:05,845
It was in your wallet.

576
01:02:05,929 --> 01:02:07,930
Behind the photo of your daughter.

577
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:11,892
-Why didn't you show me this before?
-I couldn't.

578
01:02:16,439 --> 01:02:17,814
I'm sorry.

579
01:02:28,992 --> 01:02:31,201
What are you doing to them, you bastard?

580
01:02:39,669 --> 01:02:41,920
OK. OK.

581
01:02:43,005 --> 01:02:45,048
OK, I've got to think now.

582
01:02:47,801 --> 01:02:49,802
Think about this -

583
01:02:49,887 --> 01:02:52,346
you don't need a gun to kill Adam.

584
01:02:53,681 --> 01:02:56,224
When there's that much poison in your blood,

585
01:02:56,309 --> 01:02:59,519
the only thing left to do is shoot yourself.

586
01:03:33,468 --> 01:03:35,511
What are you doing?

587
01:03:42,227 --> 01:03:45,562
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

588
01:03:46,688 --> 01:03:49,941
Shh. Adam, listen to me.

589
01:03:50,025 --> 01:03:52,235
I want you to play along with me on this.

590
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:02,494
You got that?

591
01:04:14,714 --> 01:04:17,591
So, you er... You still want that cigarette?

592
01:04:17,676 --> 01:04:20,761
Um... yeah.

593
01:04:20,845 --> 01:04:22,888
Sure.

594
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:33,619
There! I've done it!

595
01:05:34,705 --> 01:05:36,998
I've killed him with the poison like you wanted!

596
01:05:37,082 --> 01:05:39,125
Now where's my family?

597
01:05:39,209 --> 01:05:40,668
Where are they?

598
01:05:44,922 --> 01:05:46,089
Aaaargh!

599
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:52,304
-Aagh! Jesus Christ!
-What are you...?

600
01:05:52,388 --> 01:05:55,432
I-I-I just got electrocuted!

601
01:05:55,515 --> 01:05:57,516
What?

602
01:05:57,601 --> 01:06:00,102
Jesus. That was our way out!

603
01:06:00,187 --> 01:06:02,980
Did you hear what I said? Get this thing off me!

604
01:06:03,065 --> 01:06:05,399
-Get it off!
-Stop acting!

605
01:06:05,484 --> 01:06:09,737
You think I would make that up just to mess up
your stupid fucking charade?

606
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:11,446
All right, that's it.

607
01:06:27,003 --> 01:06:29,004
Damn it!

608
01:06:34,593 --> 01:06:36,636
I remember everything now.

609
01:06:38,847 --> 01:06:41,099
I remember how I got here.

610
01:08:12,601 --> 01:08:14,643
Oh...

611
01:08:28,990 --> 01:08:31,408
Great.

612
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:03,188
Is someone there?

613
01:09:14,741 --> 01:09:16,784
I can hear you.

614
01:09:47,813 --> 01:09:49,855
Huh!

615
01:09:51,983 --> 01:09:53,526
What the...?

616
01:09:56,530 --> 01:09:58,572
What the Christ...?

617
01:10:07,373 --> 01:10:09,707
What the...?

618
01:10:14,462 --> 01:10:16,505
Huh!

619
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:19,591
Who is that?

620
01:10:19,676 --> 01:10:22,386
Who's in there?

621
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:24,471
Come out!

622
01:10:24,556 --> 01:10:26,598
I'll kill you, you motherfucker!

623
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:43,363
Aagh!

624
01:11:09,763 --> 01:11:11,514
Who is this?

625
01:11:11,599 --> 01:11:13,975
Daddy?

626
01:11:14,059 --> 01:11:15,310
Diana.

627
01:11:15,394 --> 01:11:17,478
Daddy, is that you?

628
01:11:18,605 --> 01:11:21,273
Yeah, baby, it's me, I'm here.

629
01:11:21,357 --> 01:11:23,775
I-I'm scared, Daddy.

630
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:26,987
Don't worry, honey. Everything's gonna be OK.

631
01:11:27,071 --> 01:11:30,782
-Where's Mommy?
-She's here with me.

632
01:11:30,866 --> 01:11:32,992
Let me talk to her, sweetie.

633
01:11:33,076 --> 01:11:35,161
OK? Put Mommy on.

634
01:11:35,245 --> 01:11:38,623
The bad man from my room is here.

635
01:11:38,707 --> 01:11:41,584
He has us tied up...

636
01:11:41,668 --> 01:11:43,919
And he has a gun.

637
01:11:44,003 --> 01:11:46,755
Wh-What man?

638
01:11:46,839 --> 01:11:48,882
Please come home, Daddy.

639
01:11:50,301 --> 01:11:51,301
Hello?

640
01:11:52,428 --> 01:11:53,428
Hello?

641
01:11:54,472 --> 01:11:55,472
Diana?

642
01:11:56,598 --> 01:11:57,765
Diana?

643
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:00,434
Diana!

644
01:12:03,938 --> 01:12:04,938
Larry.

645
01:12:05,023 --> 01:12:08,233
Ali? Is that you?

646
01:12:08,317 --> 01:12:10,360
Is Adam there?

647
01:12:12,237 --> 01:12:13,821
Well, how do you know...

648
01:12:14,948 --> 01:12:16,449
Ali...

649
01:12:17,534 --> 01:12:19,535
What is going on?

650
01:12:20,662 --> 01:12:22,580
Don't believe Adam's lies.

651
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:27,918
He knows you.
He knew all about you before today.

652
01:12:32,131 --> 01:12:34,216
Hello? Ali?

653
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:37,134
Ali?

654
01:12:38,428 --> 01:12:39,887
Hello!

655
01:12:39,971 --> 01:12:41,972
Goddamn you!

656
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:45,434
If you so much as lay a finger on them,
I'll kill you.

657
01:12:45,519 --> 01:12:48,104
You hear me, you son of a bitch? I'll kill you!

658
01:12:54,652 --> 01:12:56,319
Damn!

659
01:12:57,404 --> 01:12:59,823
Are they OK?

660
01:13:02,992 --> 01:13:06,411
My wife, she er... She mentioned your name.

661
01:13:08,832 --> 01:13:10,874
What did she say?

662
01:13:12,585 --> 01:13:14,711
She told me...

663
01:13:14,795 --> 01:13:16,879
not to believe you.

664
01:13:18,006 --> 01:13:19,632
Believe me about what?

665
01:13:22,427 --> 01:13:24,887
She told me you knew me.

666
01:13:29,267 --> 01:13:30,934
Who are you?

667
01:13:32,061 --> 01:13:34,062
You know who I am.

668
01:13:34,146 --> 01:13:37,983
Stop the lies! You're a liar!
I need to know the truth!

669
01:13:40,527 --> 01:13:42,570
I'm a liar?

670
01:13:43,655 --> 01:13:45,865
What did you do last night, Lawrence?

671
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:49,535
Work at a hospital, saving sick children?

672
01:13:49,619 --> 01:13:52,371
You told me
that after you left your house last night,

673
01:13:52,454 --> 01:13:54,455
you went to work at a hospital.

674
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:57,834
-That's because it's the truth.
-No, it's not.

675
01:13:57,918 --> 01:14:00,128
Your wife is right, Larry.

676
01:14:01,255 --> 01:14:05,008
You don't recall getting your picture taken
in that parking lot?

677
01:14:22,649 --> 01:14:25,860
I can prove that you didn't go anywhere near
a hospital last night.

678
01:14:33,743 --> 01:14:36,244
It's not the first time I've done it either, Larry.

679
01:14:36,329 --> 01:14:38,788
I've been taking pictures of you for days now.

680
01:14:45,378 --> 01:14:47,504
-Why?
-You want to know what I do?

681
01:14:47,589 --> 01:14:50,090
I get paid to take pictures of rich guys like you,

682
01:14:50,175 --> 01:14:52,593
who go to seedy motels to fuck their secretaries.

683
01:14:52,677 --> 01:14:55,304
Last night, I went to your house.

684
01:14:55,388 --> 01:14:57,640
and watched you leave.

685
01:14:57,723 --> 01:14:59,140
I followed you...

686
01:15:00,643 --> 01:15:02,393
...all the way to that shit-bag hotel.

687
01:15:06,273 --> 01:15:09,359
You've er... had these with you the whole time?

688
01:15:09,442 --> 01:15:12,361
I found them in there with the hacksaws.

689
01:15:13,404 --> 01:15:15,364
I don't know how they got there.

690
01:15:15,448 --> 01:15:21,244
-Right! You're so full of it!
-Face it, Larry, we're both bullshitters!

691
01:15:21,329 --> 01:15:24,122
But my camera isn't. It doesn't know how to lie.

692
01:15:24,206 --> 01:15:27,166
It only shows you what's put right in front of it.

693
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:30,419
Just out of curiosity,
what did you do in that motel room?

694
01:15:30,504 --> 01:15:32,963
You got out of there pretty fast.

695
01:15:41,597 --> 01:15:43,598
Why did you um...

696
01:15:43,682 --> 01:15:46,768
deem it necessary to page me
when you knew I was at home?

697
01:15:47,852 --> 01:15:49,895
I didn't know if you were going to make it.

698
01:15:52,065 --> 01:15:54,775
I gave you a precise time at which to page me.

699
01:15:55,944 --> 01:15:57,694
You can't do that.

700
01:15:57,779 --> 01:16:00,572
It's not like I know the rules for this sort of stuff.

701
01:16:04,785 --> 01:16:08,496
-What's wrong, Dr. Gordon?
-Look, um...

702
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:12,208
It was wrong of me to make you come here.

703
01:16:12,292 --> 01:16:15,962
-But I thought we've...
-No, no. Please.

704
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:19,256
I'm sorry.

705
01:16:32,435 --> 01:16:34,436
You tell anyone you were here?

706
01:16:34,521 --> 01:16:36,063
No.

707
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:49,242
Hello.

708
01:16:53,413 --> 01:16:55,873
-It's for you.
-For me?

709
01:17:10,012 --> 01:17:11,012
Hello.

710
01:17:13,015 --> 01:17:16,684
I know what you're doing... Doctor.

711
01:17:18,728 --> 01:17:20,770
I...

712
01:17:30,989 --> 01:17:32,990
I have to go.

713
01:17:33,074 --> 01:17:35,326
-What happened?
-I gotta go.

714
01:17:53,677 --> 01:17:55,178
Who was it?

715
01:17:55,262 --> 01:17:56,888
Who was what?

716
01:17:56,971 --> 01:18:00,140
The person who paid you to follow me.
Who was it?

717
01:18:00,224 --> 01:18:04,269
He calls himself Bob and he gives me
the money upfront. 200 bucks a night.

718
01:18:04,354 --> 01:18:07,064
If I'd known I'd end up here,
I'd have asked for a lot more.

719
01:18:07,148 --> 01:18:10,192
What does that mean?
Does that mean you saw what happened to me?

720
01:18:10,275 --> 01:18:13,235
What I saw was you get into your car. That's it.

721
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:16,822
I didn't ask your name.
I didn't know who you were.

722
01:18:16,907 --> 01:18:20,493
I don't know how I got here.
I don't know how you got here.

723
01:18:20,577 --> 01:18:23,913
I took the shots and went straight home
to develop them.

724
01:18:23,996 --> 01:18:26,873
Next thing I know, I'm chained to a pipe

725
01:18:26,957 --> 01:18:30,585
in some prehistoric bathroom, staring at
the guy I've been taking shots of.

726
01:18:30,670 --> 01:18:34,839
Clearly, whoever paid you to take pictures of me
is the one who put us here.

727
01:18:34,924 --> 01:18:35,924
Maybe.

728
01:18:36,007 --> 01:18:38,050
Of course it is! What did he look like?

729
01:18:38,134 --> 01:18:40,302
-Just a guy.
-Was he tall? Skinny? Obese?

730
01:18:40,387 --> 01:18:43,472
-I don't take notes.
-You must remember something about him.

731
01:18:43,556 --> 01:18:46,100
-I can't.
-You don't remember a thing about the guy?

732
01:18:46,184 --> 01:18:48,811
-I told you, I...
-For fuck's sake! I give up!

733
01:18:48,894 --> 01:18:52,146
He's a tall black guy.
He's got a scar around his neck, OK?

734
01:19:02,865 --> 01:19:03,865
Tapp.

735
01:19:07,203 --> 01:19:10,497
-Detective Tapp.
-Whoa.

736
01:19:10,581 --> 01:19:13,708
The guy who paid me to take these photos
was not a cop.

737
01:19:13,793 --> 01:19:16,711
No, no. He was discharged from the police force.

738
01:19:16,795 --> 01:19:19,296
He broke down after his partner was killed.

739
01:19:19,381 --> 01:19:22,675
But that didn't stop him harassing me.
The guy became obsessed.

740
01:19:22,759 --> 01:19:26,220
He's convinced I must have somehow
been involved with the murders.

741
01:19:26,304 --> 01:19:28,931
He's crazy. And you helped him.

742
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:32,809
You took money from him to invade my privacy.

743
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:34,811
How could you do that?

744
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:37,564
-Call it my need to eat.
-Right.

745
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:41,484
Right. You know what, Adam,
you're not a victim of this game.

746
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:43,527
-You're part of it.
-Oh, really?

747
01:19:43,611 --> 01:19:46,113
This cop thinks you're the one behind it all.

748
01:19:46,197 --> 01:19:49,867
I told you, he's not a cop.
He's a bottom feeder, just like you!

749
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:52,786
What are you pissed off about?
The fact I took shots of you

750
01:19:52,871 --> 01:19:56,248
or the fact that I took shots of you
while you cheated on your wife?

751
01:19:56,331 --> 01:19:59,959
-I did not cheat on her!
-What do you care what I think anyway?

752
01:20:00,043 --> 01:20:05,131
I don't give a crap if you covered yourself in
peanut butter and had a 15-hooker gangbang.

753
01:20:19,769 --> 01:20:22,521
How did I get here? I had...

754
01:20:22,606 --> 01:20:24,440
I had everything in order.

755
01:20:26,568 --> 01:20:28,903
My whole life was in perfect order.

756
01:20:56,512 --> 01:20:58,847
Sweetheart, are you OK?

757
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:06,437
Mommy just needs you to be
really, really, really, really strong right now.

758
01:21:07,522 --> 01:21:10,566
I'm not gonna let anybody hurt you.

759
01:21:11,692 --> 01:21:13,485
You got that?

760
01:21:13,569 --> 01:21:16,237
OK. That's my good girl.

761
01:21:39,259 --> 01:21:43,429
Hey, was there someone else
at your house last night.

762
01:21:43,514 --> 01:21:45,515
besides your wife and daughter?

763
01:21:45,599 --> 01:21:48,267
-No.
-Well, there's someone here.

764
01:22:05,534 --> 01:22:07,535
I know him.

765
01:22:07,619 --> 01:22:10,204
-Zep.
-Who?

766
01:22:10,288 --> 01:22:14,250
His name is Zep. He's an orderly at my hospital.

767
01:22:14,334 --> 01:22:15,918
Zep.

768
01:22:16,001 --> 01:22:18,086
You perverted little psychopath.

769
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:22,632
I'm gonna take great pleasure
in seeing you pay for this,

770
01:22:22,716 --> 01:22:24,759
you bastard fuck!

771
01:22:28,012 --> 01:22:29,012
Look.

772
01:22:35,895 --> 01:22:38,814
We're out of time.

773
01:22:57,582 --> 01:23:01,543
Shh, sweetie... sweetie.

774
01:23:01,627 --> 01:23:03,920
-Mommy, help me!
-Ssh...

775
01:23:21,187 --> 01:23:23,771
Dr. Gordon's time is up.

776
01:23:25,316 --> 01:23:28,443
Now I've got to do what I've got to do, and...

777
01:23:29,528 --> 01:23:32,864
.. I'm afraid it has to be you
that tells him he failed.

778
01:23:44,709 --> 01:23:46,418
Is that you, Zep, you bastard?

779
01:23:46,501 --> 01:23:48,878
I know it's you, you son of a bitch!

780
01:23:48,962 --> 01:23:50,963
La... Larry.

781
01:23:51,048 --> 01:23:52,590
Ali?

782
01:23:52,674 --> 01:23:54,383
You failed.

783
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:57,720
Hello?

784
01:23:58,554 --> 01:23:59,429
Hello?

785
01:24:01,432 --> 01:24:03,600
-You!
-Wait.

786
01:24:06,395 --> 01:24:09,731
Don't move! Stay on the ground.

787
01:24:09,815 --> 01:24:11,691
Give me... Give me the phone.

788
01:24:12,817 --> 01:24:14,735
Give it to me!

789
01:24:26,246 --> 01:24:27,330
Larry?

790
01:24:27,414 --> 01:24:30,041
Ali! Honey, are you all right?

791
01:24:30,125 --> 01:24:33,252
No... No, we're not. Get down!

792
01:24:34,338 --> 01:24:37,340
-Larry, where are you?
-I don't know.

793
01:24:37,423 --> 01:24:39,925
I'm being held captive in a room somewhere.

794
01:24:40,009 --> 01:24:42,719
Wh-What are you talking about?

795
01:24:43,846 --> 01:24:46,139
-I'm so sorry, Ali.
-Honey, we need you here.

796
01:24:46,224 --> 01:24:48,517
So sorry for everything. It's my fault.

797
01:24:48,601 --> 01:24:51,103
Forgive me, I've always been happy with you.

798
01:24:51,186 --> 01:24:51,894
Mommy!

799
01:24:52,979 --> 01:24:55,189
Aagh!

800
01:24:55,273 --> 01:24:56,107
Jesus!

801
01:24:58,527 --> 01:24:59,527
Ali!

802
01:25:16,334 --> 01:25:18,168
Mommy!

803
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,840
Ali! Ali!

804
01:25:24,175 --> 01:25:25,217
Mommy!

805
01:25:31,765 --> 01:25:33,641
Aargh! Aaargh!

806
01:25:40,732 --> 01:25:41,649
Freeze!

807
01:25:52,243 --> 01:25:54,077
Oh, no!

808
01:25:58,248 --> 01:26:00,666
What the fuck?

809
01:26:01,835 --> 01:26:03,919
-Yaaaa!
-Ya!

810
01:26:17,433 --> 01:26:19,893
Argh! Urgh!

811
01:26:27,108 --> 01:26:29,151
Mrs. Gordon?

812
01:26:31,946 --> 01:26:33,989
Diana!

813
01:26:38,076 --> 01:26:40,620
I'm gonna kill your husband now, Mrs. Gordon.

814
01:27:10,106 --> 01:27:10,940
Lawrence!

815
01:27:16,278 --> 01:27:17,987
Lawrence, get up!

816
01:27:29,707 --> 01:27:31,708
Lawrence! Get up!

817
01:27:33,252 --> 01:27:34,461
I need you!

818
01:27:48,016 --> 01:27:51,519
Oh, thank God, I thought you were dead.

819
01:27:56,857 --> 01:27:59,025
He... He... He electrocuted me.

820
01:27:59,777 --> 01:28:03,405
I told you.
The same thing happened to me. See?

821
01:28:03,489 --> 01:28:05,615
I wasn't lying. See?

822
01:28:05,699 --> 01:28:07,616
Fuck this shit!

823
01:29:15,513 --> 01:29:17,347
No!

824
01:29:19,392 --> 01:29:21,185
Lawrence, calm down.

825
01:29:21,269 --> 01:29:23,479
-There must be a way out of this.
-Shut up!

826
01:29:23,562 --> 01:29:27,148
Just shut up! My family needs me!

827
01:29:28,567 --> 01:29:30,985
No! God!

828
01:29:31,069 --> 01:29:33,070
God! No!

829
01:29:33,155 --> 01:29:34,572
Argh!

830
01:29:39,619 --> 01:29:42,162
Lawrence! I have a family too.

831
01:29:42,246 --> 01:29:46,166
I don't see them, that's my mistake.
It's a mistake I'd like to fix.

832
01:29:50,795 --> 01:29:53,380
I'm gonna kill you, you sick asshole.

833
01:29:55,342 --> 01:29:56,467
Lawrence!

834
01:29:57,552 --> 01:29:58,844
Stop it.

835
01:30:03,390 --> 01:30:05,391
Lawrence, just calm down.

836
01:30:05,476 --> 01:30:08,102
There's a way out of here.
There's a way out!

837
01:30:08,187 --> 01:30:09,062
Lawrence!

838
01:30:11,148 --> 01:30:13,149
No! What are you... No!

839
01:30:13,233 --> 01:30:15,776
Oh, my God! Lawrence!

840
01:30:17,737 --> 01:30:20,155
What are you doing?

841
01:31:31,930 --> 01:31:33,973
What... are you doing?

842
01:31:55,828 --> 01:31:58,121
What are you... What are you...

843
01:31:59,873 --> 01:32:01,957
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

844
01:32:04,502 --> 01:32:06,503
Lawrence, don't! No!

845
01:32:06,588 --> 01:32:08,589
No, Lawrence, please!

846
01:32:08,673 --> 01:32:11,091
I'm begging you!

847
01:32:11,175 --> 01:32:13,801
Lawrence! It's not me who did this to you!

848
01:32:15,062 --> 01:32:17,439
-You have to die.
-No! I want to live!

849
01:32:17,523 --> 01:32:19,524
-I'm sorry.
-I want to live!

850
01:32:19,609 --> 01:32:21,943
-My family...
-Argh!

851
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:38,249
There! I've done it!

852
01:32:39,376 --> 01:32:41,419
Now show them to me!

853
01:32:44,799 --> 01:32:46,841
Show them to me.

854
01:32:46,926 --> 01:32:49,219
-Thank you very much, Officer.
-Larry?

855
01:32:49,302 --> 01:32:51,303
Did you get through to him?

856
01:32:51,387 --> 01:32:53,889
-There's still no answer.
-I've called the police.

857
01:32:53,973 --> 01:32:56,016
Everything is OK.

858
01:33:11,448 --> 01:33:13,032
You bastard!

859
01:33:13,116 --> 01:33:16,285
I'll fucking kill you! I'll fucking kill you!

860
01:33:16,369 --> 01:33:18,370
You fucking bastard!

861
01:33:18,454 --> 01:33:22,123
I'll fucking kill you!
You fucking bastard!

862
01:33:22,208 --> 01:33:24,334
I'll fucking kill you!

863
01:33:24,418 --> 01:33:25,961
I'll fucking kill you.

864
01:33:35,554 --> 01:33:37,721
You're too late.

865
01:33:37,806 --> 01:33:40,558
-Why?
-It's the rules.

866
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:45,979
Argh!

867
01:34:24,598 --> 01:34:26,391
You're gonna be all right.

868
01:34:26,475 --> 01:34:29,102
You're just wounded... wounded in the shoulder.

869
01:34:30,229 --> 01:34:32,939
I have to go and get help.

870
01:34:33,157 --> 01:34:35,575
Don't leave me!

871
01:34:35,659 --> 01:34:36,951
No!

872
01:34:37,036 --> 01:34:39,078
No! No!

873
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:43,082
No! Ow!

874
01:34:45,383 --> 01:34:49,082
Lawrence! Lawrence!

875
01:34:53,008 --> 01:34:54,425
D-Don't worry.

876
01:34:54,510 --> 01:34:56,010
I'll bring someone back.

877
01:34:56,095 --> 01:34:57,720
I promise.

878
01:35:18,183 --> 01:35:20,226
Key.

879
01:35:38,451 --> 01:35:40,494
Key. Key!

880
01:36:02,806 --> 01:36:05,725
Hello, Mr. Hindle.

881
01:36:05,809 --> 01:36:08,186
Or as they called you around the hospital...

882
01:36:09,271 --> 01:36:10,313
...Zep.

883
01:36:10,397 --> 01:36:12,440
I want you to make a choice.

884
01:36:16,944 --> 01:36:20,405
There's a slow-acting poison
coursing through your system

885
01:36:20,490 --> 01:36:23,408
which only I have the antidote for.

886
01:36:23,493 --> 01:36:25,994
Will you murder a mother and her child

887
01:36:26,079 --> 01:36:28,455
to save yourself?

888
01:36:28,538 --> 01:36:30,498
Dr. Gordon's time is up.

889
01:36:30,582 --> 01:36:31,832
Mrs. Gordon!

890
01:36:32,709 --> 01:36:36,003
Listen carefully, if you will. There are rules.

891
01:36:36,087 --> 01:36:38,506
-Why?
-It's the rules.

892
01:37:25,758 --> 01:37:29,636
The key to that chain is in the bathtub.

893
01:37:40,397 --> 01:37:43,399
He's a very interesting person.
His name is John.

894
01:37:43,483 --> 01:37:45,901
He has an inoperable frontal-lobe tumor.

895
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:49,320
-Sick from disease eating away at me inside.
-Sounds like Jigsaw.

896
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:52,282
I'm sick of people
not appreciating their blessings.

897
01:37:52,366 --> 01:37:55,910
He books himself front-row seats
to his own sicko games.

898
01:37:55,995 --> 01:37:59,872
Hello, Mark, Paul, Amanda,
Zep, Adam, Dr. Gordon.

899
01:37:59,956 --> 01:38:01,665
I want to play a game.

900
01:38:27,898 --> 01:38:31,443
Most people are so ungrateful to be alive.

901
01:38:32,445 --> 01:38:33,987
But not you.

902
01:38:35,114 --> 01:38:37,282
Not any more.

903
01:38:40,827 --> 01:38:43,620
Game over.

904
01:38:43,705 --> 01:38:46,623
Argh! Argh!

905
01:38:46,708 --> 01:38:49,543
Don't! Don't!

906
01:38:49,627 --> 01:38:53,380
Don't! Argh!
